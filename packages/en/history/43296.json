Published January, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I have sought to trace, from the original sources\r\nas far as possible, the character and career of an institution which\r\nexercised no small influence on the fate of Spain and even, one may say,\r\nindirectly on the civilized world. The material for this is preserved so\r\nsuperabundantly in the immense Spanish archives that no one writer can\r\npretend to exhaust the subject. There can be no finality in a history\r\nresting on so vast a mass of inedited documents and I do not flatter\r\nmyself that I have accomplished such a result, but I am not without hope\r\nthat what I have drawn from them and from the labors of previous\r\nscholars has enabled me to present a fairly accurate survey of one of\r\nthe most remarkable organizations recorded in human annals.\r\n\r\nIn this a somewhat minute analysis has seemed to be indispensable of its\r\nstructure and methods of procedure, of its relations with the other\r\nbodies of the State and of its dealings with the various classes subject\r\nto its extensive jurisdiction. This has involved the accumulation of\r\nmuch detail in order to present the daily operation of a tribunal of\r\nwhich the real importance is to be sought, not so much in the awful\r\nsolemnities of the auto de fe, or in the cases of a few celebrated\r\nvictims, as in the silent influence exercised by its incessant and\r\nsecret labors among the mass of the people and in the limitations which\r\nit placed on the Spanish intellect--in the resolute conservatism with\r\nwhich it held the nation in the medieval groove and unfitted it for the\r\nexercise of rational liberty when the nineteenth century brought in the\r\ninevitable Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe intimate relations between Spain and Portugal, especially during the\r\nunion of the kingdoms from 1580 to 1640, has rendered necessary the\r\ninclusion, in the chapter devoted to the Jews, of a brief sketch of the\r\nPortuguese Inquisition, which earned a reputation even more sinister\r\nthan its Spanish prototype.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude without expressing my thanks to the gentlemen whose\r\naid has enabled me to collect the documents on which the work is largely\r\nbased--Don Claudio Pérez Gredilla of the Archives of Simancas, Don Ramon\r\nSanta María of those of Alcalá de Henares prior to their removal to\r\nMadrid, Don Francisco de Bofarull y Sans of those of the Crown of\r\nAragon, Don J. Figueroa Hernández, formerly American Vice-consul at\r\nMadrid, and to many others to whom I am indebted in a minor degree. I\r\nhave also to tender my acknowledgements to the authorities of the\r\nBodleian Library and of the Royal Libraries of Copenhagen, Munich,\r\nBerlin and the University of Halle, for favors warmly appreciated.\r\n\r\nHENRY CHARLES LEA.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, OCTOBER, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF VOL.

Many causes had contributed\r\nto prolong and intensify the evils of the feudal system and to\r\nneutralize such advantages as it possessed. The struggles of the\r\nreconquest from the Saracen, continued at intervals through seven\r\nhundred years and varied by constant civil broils, had bred a race of\r\nfierce and turbulent nobles as eager to attack a neighbor or their\r\nsovereign as the Moor. The contemptuous manner in which the Cid is\r\nrepresented, in the earliest ballads, as treating his king, shows what\r\nwas, in the twelfth century, the feeling of the chivalry of Castile\r\ntoward its overlord, and a chronicler of the period seems rather to\r\nglory in the fact that it was always in rebellion against the royal\r\npower.[1] So fragile was the feudal bond that a _ricohome_ or noble\r\ncould at any moment renounce allegiance by a simple message sent to the\r\nking through a hidalgo.[2] The necessity of attracting population and\r\norganizing conquered frontiers, which subsequently became inland, led to\r\ngranting improvidently liberal franchises to settlers, which weakened\r\nthe powers of the crown,[3] without building up, as in France, a\r\npowerful Third Estate to serve as a counterpoise to the nobles and\r\neventually to undermine feudalism. In Spain the business of the\r\nCastilian was war. The arts of peace were left with disdain to the Jews\r\nand the conquered Moslems, known as Mudéjares, who were allowed to\r\nremain on Christian soil and to form a distinct element in the\r\npopulation. No flourishing centres of industrious and independent\r\nburghers arose out of whom the kings could mould a body that should lend\r\nthem efficient support in their struggles with their powerful vassals.\r\nThe attempt, indeed, was made; the Córtes, whose co-operation was\r\nrequired in the enactment of laws, consisted of representatives from\r\nseventeen cities,[4] who while serving enjoyed personal inviolability,\r\nbut so little did the cities prize this privilege that, under Henry IV,\r\nthey complained of the expense of sending deputies. The crown, eager to\r\nfind some new sources of influence, agreed to pay them and thus obtained\r\nan excuse for controlling their election, and although this came too\r\nlate for Henry to benefit by it, it paved the way for the assumption of\r\nabsolute domination by Ferdinand and Isabella, after which the revolt of\r\nthe Comunidades proved fruitless. Meanwhile their influence diminished,\r\ntheir meetings were scantily attended and they became little more than\r\nan instrument which, in the interminable strife that cursed the land,\r\nwas used alternately by any faction as opportunity offered.[5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ABASEMENT OF THE CROWN_]\r\n\r\nThe crown itself had contributed greatly to its own abasement. When, in\r\nthe thirteenth century, a ruler such as San Fernando III. made the laws\r\nrespected and vigorously extended the boundaries of Christianity,\r\nCastile gave promise of development in power and culture which miserably\r\nfailed in the performance. In 1282 the rebellion of Sancho el Bravo\r\nagainst his father Alfonso was the commencement of decadence. To\r\npurchase the allegiance of the nobles he granted them all that they\r\nasked, and to avert the discontent consequent on taxation he supplied\r\nhis treasury by alienating the crown lands.[6] Notwithstanding the\r\nabilities of the regent, María de Molina, the successive minorities of\r\nher son and grandson, Fernando IV and Alfonso XI, stimulated the\r\ndownward progress, although the vigor of the latter in his maturity\r\nrestored in some degree the lustre of the crown and his stern justice\r\nre-established order, so that, as we are told, property could be left\r\nunguarded in the streets at night.[7] His son, Don Pedro, earned the\r\nepithet of the Cruel by his ruthless endeavor to reduce to obedience his\r\nturbulent nobles, whose disaffection invited the usurpation of his\r\nbastard brother, Henry of Trastamara. The throne which the latter won by\r\nfratricide and the aid of the foreigner, he could only hold by fresh\r\nconcessions to his magnates which fatally reduced the royal power.[8]\r\nThis heritage he left to his son, Juan I, who forcibly described, in the\r\nCórtes of Valladolid in 1385, how he wore mourning in his heart because\r\nof his powerlessness to administer justice and to govern as he ought, in\r\nconsequence of the evil customs which he was unable to correct.[9] This\r\ndepicts the condition of the monarchy during the century intervening\r\nbetween the murder of Pedro and the accession of Isabella--a dreary\r\nperiod of endless revolt and civil strife, during which the central\r\nauthority was steadily growing less able to curb the lawless elements\r\ntending to eventual anarchy. The king was little more than a puppet of\r\nwhich rival factions sought to gain possession in order to cover their\r\nambitions with a cloak of legality, and those which failed to secure his\r\nperson treated his authority with contempt, or set up some rival in a\r\nson or brother as an excuse for rebellion. The work of the Reconquest\r\nwhich, for six hundred years, had been the leading object of national\r\npride was virtually abandoned, save in some spasmodic enterprise, such\r\nas the capture of Antequera, and the little kingdom of Granada,\r\napparently on the point of extinction under Alfonso XI, seemed destined\r\nto perpetuate for ever on Spanish soil the hateful presence of the\r\ncrescent.\r\n\r\nThe long reign of the feeble Juan II, from 1406 to 1454, was followed by\r\nthat of the feebler Henry IV, popularly known as El Impotente. In the\r\nSeguro de Tordesillas, in 1439, the disaffected nobles virtually\r\ndictated terms to Juan II.[10] In the Deposition of Ávila, in 1465, they\r\ntreated Henry IV with the bitterest contempt. His effigy, clad in\r\nmourning and adorned with the royal insignia, was placed upon a throne\r\nand four articles of accusation were read. For the first he was\r\npronounced unworthy of the kingly station, when Alonso Carrillo,\r\nArchbishop of Toledo, removed the crown; for the second he was deprived\r\nof the administration of justice, when Álvaro de Zuñiga, Count of\r\nPlasencia, took away the sword; for the third he was deprived of the\r\ngovernment, when Rodrigo Pimentel, Count of Benavente, struck the\r\nsceptre away; for the fourth he was sentenced to lose the throne, when\r\nDiego López de Zuñiga tumbled the image from its seat with an indecent\r\ngibe. It was scarce more than a continuation of the mockery when they\r\nelected as his successor his brother Alfonso, a child eleven years of\r\nage.[11]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VIOLENCE AND TREACHERY_]\r\n\r\nThe lawless independence of the nobles and the effacement of the royal\r\nauthority may be estimated from a single example. At Plasencia two\r\npowerful lords, Garcí Alvárez de Toledo, Señor of Oropesa, and Hernan\r\nRodríguez de Monroy, kept the country in an uproar with their armed\r\ndissension. Juan II sent Ayala, Señor of Cebolla, with a royal\r\ncommission to suppress the disorder. Monroy, in place of submitting,\r\ninsulted Ayala, who as a \"buen caballero\" disdained to complain to the\r\nking and preferred to avenge himself. Juan on hearing of this summoned\r\nto his presence Monroy, who collected all his friends and retainers and\r\nset out with a formidable army. Ayala made a similar levy and set upon\r\nhim as he passed near Cebolla. There was a desperate battle in which\r\nAyala was worsted and forced to take refuge in Cebolla, while Monroy\r\npassed on to Toledo and, when he kissed the king's hands, Juan told him\r\nthat he had sent for him to cut off his head, but as Ayala had preferred\r\nto right himself he gave Monroy a God-speed on his journey home and\r\nwashed his hands of the whole affair.[12]\r\n\r\nThe _ricosomes_ who thus were released from all the restraint of law had\r\nas little respect for those of honor and morality. The virtues which we\r\nare wont to ascribe to chivalry were represented by such follies as the\r\ncelebrated _Passo Honroso_ of Suero de Quiñones, when that knight and\r\nhis nine comrades, in 1434, kept, in honor of their ladies, for thirty\r\ndays against all comers, the pass of the Bridge of Orbigo, at the season\r\nof the feast of Santiago and sixty-nine challengers presented themselves\r\nin the lists.[13] With exceptions such as this, and a rare manifestation\r\nof magnanimity, as when the Duke of Medina Sidonia raised an army and\r\nhastened to the relief of his enemy, Rodrigo Ponce de Leon besieged in\r\nAlhama,[14] the record of the time is one of the foulest treachery, from\r\nwhich truth and honor are absent and human nature displays itself in its\r\nbasest aspect. According to contemporary belief, Ferdinand was indebted\r\nfor the crown of Aragon to the poisoning of his brother, the deeply\r\nmourned Carlos, Prince of Viana, while the crown of Castile fell to\r\nIsabella through the similar taking off of her brother Alfonso.[15]\r\n\r\nA characteristic incident is one involving Doña Maria de Monroy, who\r\nmarried into the great house of Henríquez of Seville, and was left a\r\nwidow with two boys. When the youths were respectively eighteen and\r\nnineteen years old they were close friends of two gentlemen of Seville\r\nnamed Mançano. The younger brother, dicing with them in their house, was\r\ninvolved in a quarrel with them, when they set upon him with their\r\nservants and slew him. Then, fearing the vengeance of the elder brother,\r\nthey sent him a friendly message to come and play with them; when he\r\ncame they led him along a dark corridor in which they suddenly turned\r\nupon him and stabbed him to death. When the disfigured corpses of her\r\nboys were brought to Doña María she shed no tears, but the fierceness of\r\nher eyes frightened all who looked upon her. The Mançanos promptly took\r\nhorse and fled to Portugal, whither Doña María followed them in male\r\nattire with a band of twenty cavaliers. Her spies were speedily on the\r\ntrack of the fugitives; within a month of the murders she came at night\r\nto the house where they lay concealed; the doors were broken in and she\r\nentered with ten of her men while the rest kept guard outside. The\r\nMançanos put themselves in defence and shouted for help, but before the\r\nneighbors could assemble she had both their heads in her left hand and\r\nwas galloping off with her troop, never stopping till she reached\r\nSalamanca, where she went to the church and laid the bloody heads on the\r\ntomb of her boys. Thenceforth she was known as Doña María la Brava, and\r\nher exploit led to long and murderous feuds between the Monroyes and the\r\nMançanos.[16]\r\n\r\nDoña María was but a type of the unsexed women, _mugeres varoniles_,\r\ncommon at the time, who would take the field or maintain their place in\r\nfactious intrigue with as much ferocity and pertinacity as men.\r\nFerdinand could well look without surprise on the activity in court and\r\ncamp of his queen Isabella, when he remembered the prowess of his\r\nmother, Juana Henríquez, who had secured for him the crown of Aragon.\r\nDoña Leonora Pimentel, Duchess of Arévalo, was one of these; of the\r\nCountess of Medellin it was said that no Roman captain could get the\r\nbetter of her in feats of arms, and the Countess of Haro was equally\r\nnoted. The Countess of Medellin, indeed, kept her own son in prison for\r\nyears while she enjoyed the revenues of his town of Medellin and, when\r\nQueen Isabella refused to confirm her possession of the place, she\r\ntransferred her allegiance to the King of Portugal to whom she delivered\r\nthe castle of Merida. At the same time the Moorish influence, which was\r\nso strong in Castile, occasionally led to the opposite extreme. The Duke\r\nof Najera kept his daughters in such absolute seclusion that no man, not\r\neven his sons, was permitted to enter the apartments reserved for the\r\nwomen, and the reason he alleged--that the heart does not covet what the\r\neye does not see--was little flattering to either sex.[17]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VIRTUAL ANARCHY_]\r\n\r\nThe condition of the common people can readily be imagined in this\r\nperpetual strife between warlike, ambitious and unprincipled nobles, now\r\nuniting in factions which involved the whole realm in war, and now\r\ncontenting themselves with assaults upon their neighbors. The land was\r\ndesolated; the husbandman scarce could take heart to plant his seed, for\r\nthe harvest was apt to be garnered with the sword and thrust into\r\ncastles to provision them against siege. As a writer of the period tells\r\nus, there was neither law nor justice save that of arms.[18] In a letter\r\ndescribing the universal anarchy, written by Hernando del Pulgar from\r\nMadrid, in 1473, he says that for more than five years there has been no\r\ncommunication from Murcia, where the family of Fajardo reigned\r\nsupreme--it is, he says, as foreign a land as Navarre.[19] That the\r\nroads were unsafe for trade or travel was a matter of course; every\r\npetty hidalgo converted his stronghold into a den of robbers, and what\r\nthese left was swept away by bands of Free Companions.[20] Disorder\r\nreigned supreme and all-pervading. The crown was powerless and the royal\r\ntreasury exhausted. Improvident grants of lands and revenues and\r\njurisdictions, to bribe the treacherous fidelity of faithless nobles, or\r\nto gratify worthless favorites, were made, till there was nothing left\r\nto give, and then Henry IV bestowed licenses for private mints, until\r\nthere were a hundred and fifty of them at work, flooding the land with\r\nbase money, to the unutterable confusion of the coinage and the\r\nimpoverishment of the people.[21] The Córtes of Madrid, in 1467, and of\r\nOcaña in 1469, called on Henry to resume his improvident grants, and\r\nthose of Madrigal, in 1476, repeated the urgency to Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, who had been forced to follow his example. To this the\r\nsovereigns replied thanking the Córtes and postponing the matter. They\r\ndid not feel themselves strong enough until 1480, when at the Córtes of\r\nToledo, they resumed thirty million maravedís of revenue which had been\r\nalienated during the troubles, and this after an investigation which\r\nleft untouched the gifts to loyal subjects and only withdrew such as had\r\nbeen extorted.[22] Respect for the crown had fallen as low as its\r\nrevenues. A story told of the Count of Benavente shows how difficult it\r\nwas, even after the accession of Isabella, for the nobles to recognize\r\nthat they owed any obedience to the sovereign. He was walking with the\r\nqueen when a woman came weeping and begging justice, saying that he had\r\nhad her husband slain in spite of a royal safe-conduct. She showed the\r\nletter which her husband had carried in his breast, pierced by the blow\r\nwhich had ended his life, when the count jeeringly remarked \"A cuirass\r\nwould have been of more service.\" Piqued by this Isabella said \"Count do\r\nyou then not wish there was no king in Castile?\" \"Rather,\" said he, \"I\r\nwish there were many.\" \"And why?\" \"Because then I should be one of\r\nthem.\"[23]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHARACTER OF PRELATES_]\r\n\r\nIn such a chaos of lawless passion it is not to be supposed that the\r\nChurch was better than the nobles who filled its high places with\r\nworthless scions of their stocks, or than the lower classes of the laity\r\nwho sought in it provision for a life of idleness and licence. The\r\nprimate of Castile was the Archbishop of Toledo, who was likewise _ex\r\nofficio_ chancellor of the realm and whose revenues were variously\r\nestimated at from eighty to a hundred thousand ducats, with patronage at\r\nhis disposal amounting to a hundred thousand more.[24] The occupant of\r\nthis exalted position, at the accession of Isabella, was Alonso\r\nCarrillo, a turbulent prelate, delighting in war, foremost in all the\r\ncivil broils of the period, who, not content with the immense income of\r\nhis see, lavished extravagant sums in alchemy. Hernando del Pulgar, in a\r\nletter of remonstrance, said to him, \"The people look to you as their\r\nbishop and find in you their enemy; they groan and complain that you use\r\nyour authority not for their benefit and reformation but for their\r\ndestruction; not as an exemplar of kindness and peace but for\r\ncorruption, scandal, and disturbance.\" When, in 1495, the puritan\r\nXimenes was appointed to the archbishopric, one of his first acts is\r\nsaid to have been the removal, from near the altar of the Franciscan\r\nchurch of Toledo, of a magnificent tomb which Carrillo had erected to\r\nhis bastard, Troilo Carrillo.[25]\r\n\r\nHis successor in the see of Toledo has a special interest for us in view\r\nof his labors to purify the faith which culminated in establishing the\r\nInquisition. Pero González de Mendoza was one of the notable men of the\r\nday, whose influence with Ferdinand and Isabella won for him the name of\r\n\"the third king.\" While yet a child he held the curacy of Hita; at\r\ntwelve he had the archdeaconry of Guadalajara, one of the richest\r\nbenefices in Spain, which he retained during the successive bishoprics\r\nof Calahorra and Sigüenza and the archbishopric of Seville; the see of\r\nSigüenza he kept during the whole tenure successively of the\r\narchiepiscopates of Seville and Toledo, in addition to which he was a\r\ncardinal and titular Patriarch of Alexandria. With his kindred of the\r\npowerful house of Mendoza he adhered to Henry IV, until they effected\r\nthe sale of the hapless Beltraneja, who was in their hands, to her\r\nfather, Henry, for certain estates and the title of Duke del Infantado\r\nfor Diego Hurtado, the head of the family, after which Pero González and\r\nhis kinsmen promptly transferred their allegiance to Isabella. His\r\nadmiring biographer assures us that he was more ready with his hands\r\nthan with his tongue, that he was a gallant knight and that there was\r\nnever a war in Spain during his time in which he did not personally take\r\npart or at least have his troops engaged. Though he had no leisure to\r\nattend to his spiritual duties, he found time to yield to the\r\ntemptations of the flesh. When, in 1484, he led the army of invasion\r\ninto Granada he took with him his bastard, Rodrigo de Mendoza, a youth\r\nof twenty, who was already Señor del Castillo del Cid, and who, in 1492,\r\nwas created Marquis of Cenete on the occasion of his marriage, amid\r\ngreat rejoicings, in the presence of Ferdinand and Isabella, to Leonor\r\nde la Cerda, daughter and heiress of the Duke of Medina Celi and niece\r\nof Ferdinand himself. This was not the only evidence of his frailty of\r\nwhich he took no shame, for he had another son named Juan, by a lady of\r\nValladolid, who was married to Doña Ana de Aragon, another niece of\r\nFerdinand.[26]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CONDITION OF THE CHURCH_]\r\n\r\nWith such men at the head of the Church it is not to be expected that\r\nthe lower orders of the clergy should be models of decency and morality,\r\nrendering Christianity attractive to Jew and Moslem. Alonso Carrillo,\r\nthe archbishop of Toledo, can scarce be regarded as a strict\r\ndisciplinarian, but even he felt obliged, when holding the council of\r\nAranda in 1473, to endeavor to repress the more flagrant scandals of the\r\nclergy. As a corrective of their prevailing ignorance it was ordered\r\nthat in future none should be ordained who could not speak Latin--the\r\nlanguage of the ritual and the foundation of all instruction,\r\ntheological and otherwise. They were forbidden to wear silk or gaily\r\ncolored garments. As their licentiousness rendered them contemptible to\r\nthe people, they were commanded to part with their concubines within two\r\nmonths. As their fondness for dicing led to perjuries, scandals and\r\nhomicides, they were required thereafter to abstain from it, privately\r\nas well as publicly. As many priests disdained to celebrate mass, they\r\nwere ordered to do so at least four times a year; bishops, moreover,\r\nwere urged to celebrate at least thrice a year, under pain of severe\r\npenalties to be determined at the next council. The absurdities poured\r\nforth in their sermons by wandering priests and friars were to be\r\nrepressed by requiring examinations prior to issuing licenses to preach,\r\nand the scandals of the pardon-sellers were to be diminished by\r\nsubjecting them to the bishops. The bishops were also urged to make\r\nsevere examples of offenders in the lower orders of the clergy, when\r\ndelivered to them by the secular courts, and not to allow their\r\nenormities to enjoy continued immunity. The bishops, moreover, were\r\ncommanded to make no charge for conferring ordinations; they were\r\nexhorted, and all other clerics were required, not to lead a dissolute\r\nmilitary life or to enter the service of secular lords excepting of the\r\nking and princes of the blood. As duels were forbidden, both laity and\r\nclergy were warned that if slain in such encounters they would be\r\nrefused Christian burial.[27] That this effort at reform was, as might\r\nbe expected, wholly abortive is evidenced from the description of the\r\nvices of the ecclesiastical body when Ferdinand and Isabella\r\nsubsequently endeavored to correct its more flagrant scandals.[28] It\r\nwas wholly secularized and only to be distinguished from the laity by\r\nthe sacred functions which rendered its vices more abhorrent, by the\r\nimmunities which fostered and stimulated those vices and by the\r\nintolerance which, blind to all aberrations of morals, proclaimed the\r\nstake to be the only fitting punishment for aberration in the faith.\r\nWhile powerless to reform itself it yet had influence enough to educate\r\nthe people up to its standard of orthodoxy in the ruthless persecution\r\nof all whom it pleased to designate as enemies of Christ.\r\n\r\nYet in Spain the immunities and privileges of the Church were less than\r\nelsewhere throughout Christendom. The independence which the secular\r\npower in Castile had always manifested toward the Holy See and its\r\ndisregard of the canon law are points which will occasionally manifest\r\nthemselves hereafter and are worthy of a moment's consideration here. I\r\nhave elsewhere shown that, alone among the Latin nations, Castile\r\nsteadily refused to admit the medieval Inquisition and disregarded\r\ncompletely the prescriptions of the Church regarding heresy.[29] In the\r\ntwelfth century the popular feeling toward the papacy is voiced in the\r\nballads of the Cid. When a demand for tribute to the Emperor Henry IV is\r\nsaid to be made through the pope, Ruy Diaz advises King Fernando to send\r\na defiance from both of them to the pope and all his party, which the\r\nmonarch accordingly does. So when the Cid accompanies his master to a\r\ngreat council in Rome and kicks over the chair prepared for the King of\r\nFrance, the pope excommunicates him, whereupon he kneels before the holy\r\nfather and asks for absolution, telling him it will be the worse for him\r\nif he does not grant it, which the pope promptly does on condition of\r\nhis being more self-restrained during the remainder of his stay.[30]\r\nThere is no trace of the veneration for the vice-gerent of God which\r\nelsewhere was inculcated as an indispensable religious duty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DISREGARD OF THE PAPACY_]\r\n\r\nWhen such was the popular temper it is easy to understand that the\r\nprohibition to carry money out of the kingdom to the pope was even more\r\nemphatic than in England.[31] The claim to control the patronage of the\r\nChurch, which was so prolific a source of revenue to the curia, met\r\nthroughout Spain a resistance as sturdy as in England, though the\r\ntroubled condition of the land interfered with its success. In\r\nCatalonia, the Córtes, in 1419, adopted a law in which, after alluding\r\nto the scandals and irreparable injuries arising from the intrusion of\r\nstrangers, it was declared that none but natives should hold preferment\r\nof any kind and that all papal letters and bulls contravening this\r\nshould be resisted in whatever way was necessary.[32] In Castile the\r\nCórtes of 1390 forcibly represented to Juan I the evils resulting from\r\nthis foisting of strangers on the Spanish Church, but his speedy death\r\nprevented action. The remonstrance was renewed to the tutors of the\r\nyoung Henry III, who promptly placed an embargo on the revenues of\r\nforeign benefice-holders and forbade the admission of subsequent\r\nappointees. This led to a compromise, in 1393, by which the Avignonese\r\ncuria secured the recognition of existing incumbents by promising that\r\nno more such nominations should be made.[33] The promise made by the\r\nAvignonese antipope was not binding on the Roman curia and the quarrel\r\ncontinued. Even if the recipient was a native there was little ceremony\r\nin dealing with papal grants of benefices when occasion prompted, as was\r\nshown in the affair which first revealed the unbending character of the\r\nfuture Cardinal Ximenes. During his youthful sojourn in Rome Ximenes\r\nprocured papal \"expectative letters\" granting him the first preferment\r\nthat should fall vacant in the diocese of Toledo. On his return he made\r\nuse of these letters to take possession of the _arciprestazgo_ of Uceda,\r\nbut it happened that Archbishop Carrillo simultaneously gave it to one\r\nof his creatures and, as Ximenes refused to surrender his rights, he was\r\nthrown into a tower in Uceda--a tower he subsequently, when himself\r\nArchbishop of Toledo, used as a treasury. As he continued obstinate,\r\nCarrillo transferred him to the Pozo de Santorcas, a harsh dungeon used\r\nfor clerical malefactors, where he lay for six years, resolutely\r\nrefusing to abandon his claim, until released at the intercession of the\r\nwife of a nephew of Carrillo.[34] Evidently the Castilian prelates had\r\nslender respect for papal diplomas. About the same time, during the\r\ncivil war between Henry IV and his brother Alfonso, when Hernando de\r\nLuxan, Bishop of Sigüenza, died, the dean, Diego López, obtained\r\npossession of the castles and the treasure of the see, joined the party\r\nof Alfonso, and, with the aid of Archbishop Carrillo, caused himself to\r\nbe elected bishop. Meanwhile Paul II gave the see to Juan de Maella,\r\nCardinal-bishop of Zamora, but Diego López refused to obey the bulls and\r\nappealed to the future council against the pope and all his censures. He\r\ndisregarded an interdict launched against him and was supported by all\r\nhis clergy. Maella died and Paul II gave the bishopric to the Bishop of\r\nCalahorra, requesting Henry IV to place him in possession. So secure did\r\nDiego López feel that he rejected a compromise offering him the see of\r\nZamora in exchange, but the possession of Sigüenza happened to be of\r\nimportance in the war; by bribery a troop of royalist soldiers obtained\r\nadmittance to the castle and carried off López as a prisoner.[35]\r\n\r\nIt was the same even with so pious a monarch as Ferdinand the Catholic.\r\nWhen, in 1476, the archiepiscopal see of Saragossa became vacant by the\r\ndeath of Juan of Aragon, Ferdinand, with his father, Juan II, asked\r\nSixtus IV to appoint his natural son, Alfonso, a child six years of age.\r\nThe claim of the papacy to archiepiscopal appointments, based on the\r\nnecessity of the pallium, was of ancient date and had become\r\nincontestable. In the thirteenth century Alfonso X had admitted it in\r\nthe case of the archbishops, but when Isabella appointed Ximenes to the\r\nsee of Toledo in 1495 the proceedings showed that the post was\r\nconsidered to be in the gift of the crown and the papal confirmation to\r\nbe a matter of course.[36] So in the present case the request was a mere\r\nform, as was seen when Sixtus refused. The defect of birth could be\r\ndispensed for, but the youth of Alfonso was an insuperable objection,\r\nand Sixtus appointed Ansias Dezpuch, then Archbishop of Monreal,\r\nthinking that the services rendered by him and by his uncle, the Master\r\nof the Order of Montesa, would induce the king to assent. Dezpuch\r\naccepted, but Ferdinand at once sequestrated all the revenues of Monreal\r\nand the priory of Santa Cristina and ordered him to resign. On his\r\nhesitating, Ferdinand threatened to seize all the castles and revenues\r\nof the mastership of Montesa, which was effectual, and Sixtus\r\ncompromised by making the boy perpetual administrator of Saragossa.[37]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION LIMITED_]\r\n\r\nIsabella, despite her piety, was as firm as her husband in defending the\r\nclaim of the crown in these matters against the papacy. When, in 1482,\r\nthe see of Cuenca became vacant and Sixtus IV appointed a Genoese cousin\r\nto the position, Ferdinand and his queen energetically represented that\r\nonly Spaniards should have Spanish bishoprics and that the selection\r\nshould be made by them. Sixtus retorted that all benefices were in the\r\ngift of the pope and that his power, derived from God, was unlimited,\r\nwhereupon they ordered home all their subjects resident in the papal\r\ncourt and threatened to take steps for the convocation of a general\r\ncouncil. These energetic proceedings brought Sixtus to terms and he sent\r\nto Spain a special nuncio, but Ferdinand and Isabella stood on their\r\ndignity and refused even to receive him. Then the Cardinal of Spain,\r\nPero González de Mendoza, intervened and, on Sixtus withdrawing his\r\npretensions, they allowed themselves to be reconciled.[38] They alleged\r\nthat whatever might be the papal rights in other countries, in Spain\r\nthe patronage of all benefices belonged to the crown because they and\r\ntheir predecessors had wrested the land from the infidel.[39] So\r\njealous, indeed, were they of the papal encroachments that among the\r\nsubjects which they submitted to the national synod assembled by them in\r\nSeville, June, 1478, was how to prevent the residence of papal legates\r\nand nuncios, who not only carried off much money from the kingdom, but\r\nthreatened the royal pre-eminence, to which the synod replied that this\r\nrested with the sovereigns to do as their predecessors had done.[40] It\r\nis easy thus to understand why, in the organization of the Inquisition,\r\nthey insisted that all appointments should be made by the throne.\r\n\r\nIn other ways the much-prized superiority of the canon over secular law\r\nwas disregarded in Spain. The Córtes and the monarch had never hesitated\r\nto legislate on ecclesiastical affairs, and the jurisdiction of the\r\necclesiastical courts was limited with a jealousy which paid scant\r\nrespect to canon and decretal. Nothing, for instance, was better settled\r\nthan the spiritual cognizance of all matters respecting testaments, yet\r\nwhen, in 1270, the authorities of Badajoz complained of the interference\r\nof the bishop's court with secular judges in such affairs, proceeding to\r\nthe excommunication of those who exercised jurisdiction over them,\r\nAlfonso X expressed surprise and gave explicit commands that such cases\r\nshould be decided by the lay courts exclusively.[41] So little respect\r\nwas felt for the immunity of ecclesiastics from secular law, in defence\r\nof which Thomas à Becket had laid down his life, that, as late as 1351,\r\nan _ordenamiento_ of Pedro the Cruel concedes to them that they shall\r\nnot be cited before secular judges except in accordance with law.[42] On\r\nthe other hand, laymen were jealously protected from the ecclesiastical\r\ncourts. The crown was declared to be the sole judge of its own\r\njurisdiction, and no appeal from it was allowed. In the exercise of this\r\nsupreme power laws were repeatedly enacted providing that a layman, who\r\nshould cite another layman before a spiritual judge, not only lost his\r\ncause but incurred a heavy fine and disability for public office. The\r\nspiritual judge could not imprison a layman or levy execution on his\r\nproperty, and he who attempted it or any other invasion of the royal\r\njurisdiction forfeited his benefices and became a stranger in the\r\nkingdom, thus rendering him incapable of preferment. The ecclesiastic\r\nwho cited a layman before a spiritual judge lost any privileges or\r\ngraces which he might hold of the crown. The layman who attempted to\r\nremove a cause from a lay court to a spiritual one was punished with\r\nconfiscation of all his property, while any vassal who claimed benefit\r\nof clergy and declined the jurisdiction of a royal court forfeited his\r\nfief. In re-enacting these laws in the Córtes of Toledo, in 1480,\r\nFerdinand and Isabella complained of their inobservance and ordered\r\ntheir strict enforcement.[43] No other nation in Christendom dared thus\r\nto infringe on the sacred limits of spiritual jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ECCLESIASTICAL IMMUNITY_]\r\n\r\nYet even this was not all, for the secular power asserted its right to\r\nintervene in matters within the Church itself. Elsewhere the\r\nineradicable vice of priestly concubinage was left to be dealt with by\r\nbishops and archdeacons. The guilty priests themselves, even in Castile,\r\nwere exempt from civil authority, but Ferdinand and Isabella had no\r\nhesitation in invading their domiciles and, by repeated edicts in 1480,\r\n1491, 1502, and 1503, endeavored to cure the evil by fining, scourging,\r\nand banishing their partners in sin.[44] It is true, as we have seen\r\nabove, that these laws were eluded, but there was at least a vigorous\r\nattempt to enforce them for, in 1490, the clergy of Guipuzcoa complained\r\nthat the officers of justice visited their houses to see whether they\r\nkept concubines (which of course they denied) and carried off their\r\nwomen to prison, where they were forced to confess themselves\r\nconcubines, to the great dishonor of the Church, whereupon the\r\nsovereigns repressed the excessive zeal of their officials and ordered\r\nthem in future to interfere only when the concubinage was notorious.[45]\r\nA yet more significant extension of royal authority was exercised when,\r\nin 1490, the people of Lequeitio (Biscay) complained that, though there\r\nwere twelve mass-priests in the parish church, they all celebrated\r\ntogether and at uncertain times, so that the pious were unable to be\r\npresent. This was a matter belonging exclusively to the diocesan\r\nauthority, yet the appeal was made to the crown, and the Royal Council\r\nfelt no scruple in ordering the priests to celebrate in succession and\r\nat reasonable hours, under pain of banishment and forfeiture of\r\ntemporalities, thus disregarding even the imprescriptible immunities of\r\nthe priesthood.[46] So slender, indeed, was the respect paid to these\r\nimmunities that the Council of Aranda, in 1473, complained that\r\nmagistrates of cities and other temporal lords presumed to banish\r\necclesiastics holding benefices in cathedral churches, and it may well\r\nbe doubted whether the interdict with which the council threatened to\r\npunish this infraction of the canons was effective in its\r\nsuppression.[47]\r\n\r\nOne of the most deplorable abuses with which the Church afflicted\r\nsociety was the admission into the minor orders of crowds of laymen who,\r\nwithout abandoning worldly pursuits, adopted the tonsure in order to\r\nenjoy the irresponsibility afforded by the claim acquired to spiritual\r\njurisdiction, whether as criminals or as traders. The Córtes of\r\nTordesillas, in 1401, declared that the greater portion of the\r\n_rufianes_ and malefactors of the kingdom wore the tonsure; when\r\narrested by the secular officials the spiritual courts demanded them and\r\nenforced their claims with excommunication, after which they freely\r\ndischarged the evil doers. This complaint was re-echoed by almost every\r\nsubsequent Córtes, with an occasional allusion to the stimulus thus\r\nafforded to the evil propensities of those who were really clerics. The\r\nkings in responding to these representations could only say that they\r\nwould apply to the Holy Father for relief, but the relief never\r\ncame.[48] The spirit in which these claims of clerical immunity were\r\nadvanced as a shield for criminals and the resolute firmness with which\r\nthey were met by Ferdinand and Isabella are illustrated by an occurrence\r\nin 1486, in Truxillo, where a man committed a crime and was arrested by\r\nthe corregidor. He claimed to wear the tonsure and, as the officials\r\ndelayed in handing him over to the ecclesiastical court, some clerics\r\nwho were his kinsmen paraded the streets with a cross and proclaimed\r\nthat religion was being destroyed. They succeeded thus in arousing a\r\ntumult in which the culprit was liberated. The sovereigns were in\r\nGalicia, but they forthwith despatched troops to the scene of\r\ndisturbance; severe punishment was inflicted on the participants in the\r\nriot, and the clerics who had provoked it were deprived of citizenship\r\nand were banished from Spain.[49] Less serious but still abundantly\r\nobnoxious were the advantages which these tonsured laymen possessed in\r\ncivil suits by claiming the privilege of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. To\r\nmeet this was largely the object of the laws in the _Ordenanzas Reales_\r\ndescribed above, and these were supplemented, in 1519, by an edict of\r\nCharles V forbidding episcopal officials from cognizance of cases where\r\nsuch so-called clerics engaged in trade sought the spiritual courts as a\r\ndefence against civil suits. A similar abuse, by which such clerics in\r\npublic office evaded responsibility for wrong-doing by pleading their\r\nclergy, he remedied by reviving an old law of Juan I declaring them\r\nineligible to office.[50] Thus the royal power in Spain asserted its\r\nauthority over the Church after a fashion unknown elsewhere. We shall\r\nsee that, so long as it declined to persecute Moors and Jews, Rome could\r\nnot compel it to do so. When its policy changed under Isabella it was\r\ninevitable that the machinery of persecution should be under the\r\ncontrol, not of the Church, but of the sovereign. We shall also see\r\nthat, when the Inquisition inflicted similar wrongs by the immunities\r\nclaimed for its own officials and familiars, the sovereigns customarily\r\nturned a deaf ear to the complaints of the people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DISPUTED SUCCESSION_]\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of Castile when the death of the miserable Henry\r\nIV, December 12, 1474, cast the responsibility of royalty on his sister\r\nIsabella and her husband, Ferdinand of Aragon. The power of the crown\r\nwas eclipsed; the land was ravaged with interminable war between nobles\r\nwho were practically independent; the sentiment of loyalty and\r\npatriotism seemed extinct: deceit and treachery, false oaths--whatever\r\nwould serve cupidity and ambition--were universal; justice was bought\r\nand sold; private vengeance was exercised without restraint; there was\r\nno security for life and property. The fabric of society seemed about to\r\nfall in ruins.[51] To evolve order out of this chaos of passion and\r\nlawlessness was a task to test to the uttermost the nerve and capacity\r\nof the most resolute and sagacious. To add to the confusion there was a\r\ndisputed succession, although, in 1468, the oath of fidelity had been\r\ntaken to Isabella, with the assent of Henry IV, in the Contract of\r\nPerales, by which he, for the second time, acknowledged his reputed\r\ndaughter Juana not to be his. He was popularly believed to be impotent,\r\nand when his wife Juana, sister of Affonso V of Portugal, bore him a\r\ndaughter, whom he acknowledged and declared to be his heir, her\r\npaternity was maliciously ascribed to Beltran de la Cueva, and she was\r\nknown by the opposite party as La Beltraneja. Though Henry had been\r\nforced by his nobles to set aside her claims in favor of his brother\r\nAlfonso in the Declaration of Cabezon, in 1464, and, after Alfonso's\r\ndeath, in favor of Isabella, in 1468, the latter's marriage, in 1469,\r\nwith Ferdinand of Aragon so angered him that he betrothed Juana to\r\nCharles Duke of Guienne, brother of Louis XI of France, and made the\r\nnobles of his faction swear to acknowledge her. At his death he\r\ntestified again to her legitimacy and declared her to be his successor\r\nin a will which long remained hidden and finally in 1504 fell under the\r\ncontrol of Ferdinand, who ordered it burnt.[52] There was a powerful\r\nparty pledged to support her rights, and they were aided on the one hand\r\nby Affonso of Portugal and on the other by Louis of France, each eager\r\nto profit by dismembering the unhappy land. Some years of war, more\r\ncruel and bloody than even the preceding aimless strife, were required\r\nto dispose of this formidable opposition--years which tried to the\r\nutmost the ability of the young sovereigns and proved to their subjects\r\nthat at length they had rulers endowed with kingly qualities. The\r\ndecisive victory of Toro, won by Ferdinand over the Portuguese, March 1,\r\n1476, virtually settled the result, although the final treaty was not\r\nsigned until 1479. The Beltraneja was given the alternative of marrying\r\nwithin six months Prince Juan, son of Ferdinand and Isabella, then but\r\ntwo years old, or of entering the Order of Santa Clara in a Portuguese\r\nhouse. She chose the latter, but she never ceased to sign herself _Yo la\r\nReina_, and her pretensions were a frequent source of anxiety. She led a\r\nvaried life, sometimes treated as queen, with a court around her, and\r\nsometimes as a nun in her convent, dying at last in 1531, at the age of\r\nseventy.[53]\r\n\r\nIsabella was queen in fact as well as in name. Under the feudal system,\r\nthe husband of an heiress was so completely lord of the fief that, in\r\nthe Capitulations of Cervera, January 7, 1469, which preceded the\r\nmarriage, the Castilians carefully guarded the autonomy of their kingdom\r\nand Ferdinand swore to observe the conditions.[54] Yet, on the death of\r\nHenry IV, he imagined that he could disregard the compact, alleging that\r\nthe crown of Castile passed to the nearest male descendant, and that\r\nthrough his grandfather, Ferdinand of Antequera, brother of Henry III,\r\nhe was the lawful heir. The position was, however, too doubtful and\r\ncomplicated for him to insist on this; a short struggle convinced his\r\nconsummate prudence that it was wisdom to yield, and Isabella's wifely\r\ntact facilitated submission. It was agreed that their two names should\r\nappear on all papers, both their heads on all coins, and that there\r\nshould be a single seal with the arms of Castile and Aragon. Thereafter\r\nthey acted in concert which was rarely disturbed. The strong\r\nindividuality which characterized both conduced to harmony, for neither\r\nof them allowed courtiers to gain undue influence. As Pulgar says \"The\r\nfavorite of the king is the queen, the favorite of the queen is the\r\nking.\"[55]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FERDINAND'S CHARACTER_]\r\n\r\nFerdinand, without being a truly great man, was unquestionably the\r\ngreatest monarch of an age not prolific in greatness, the only\r\ncontemporary whom he did not wholly eclipse being Henry VII of England.\r\nConstant in adversity, not unduly elated in prosperity, there was a\r\nstedfast equipoise in his character which more than compensated for any\r\nlack of brilliancy. Far-seeing and cautious, he took no decisive step\r\nthat was not well prepared in advance but, when the time came, he could\r\nstrike, promptly and hard. Not naturally cruel, he took no pleasure in\r\nhuman suffering, but he was pitiless when his policy demanded.\r\nDissimulation and deceit are too invariable an ingredient of statecraft\r\nfor us to censure him severely for the craftiness in which he surpassed\r\nhis rivals or for the mendacity in which he was an adept. Cold and\r\nreserved, he preferred to inspire fear rather than to excite affection,\r\nbut he was well served and his insight into character gave him the most\r\nuseful faculty of a ruler, the ability to choose his instruments and to\r\nget from them the best work which they were capable of performing, while\r\ngratitude for past services never imposed on him any inconvenient\r\nobligations. He was popularly accused of avarice, but the empty treasury\r\nleft at his death showed that acquisitiveness with him had been merely a\r\nmeans to an end.[56] His religious convictions were sincere and moreover\r\nhe recognized wisely the invaluable aid which religion could lend to\r\nstatesmanship at a time when Latin Christianity was dominant without a\r\nrival. This was especially the case in the ten years' war with Granada,\r\nhis conduct of which would alone stamp him as a leader of men. The\r\nfool-hardy defiance of Abu-l-Hacan when, in 1478, he haughtily refused\r\nto resume payment of the tribute which for centuries had been imposed on\r\nGranada, and when, in 1481, he broke the existing truce by surprising\r\nZahara, was a fortunate occurrence which Ferdinand improved to the\r\nutmost. The unruly Castilian nobles had been reduced to order, but they\r\nchafed under the unaccustomed restraint. By giving their warlike\r\ninstincts legitimate employment in a holy cause, he was securing\r\ninternal peace; by leading his armies personally, he was winning the\r\nrespect of his Castilian subjects who hated him as an Aragonese, and he\r\nwas training them to habits of obedience. By making conquests for the\r\ncrown of Castile he became naturalized and was no longer a foreigner. It\r\nwas more than a hundred years since a King of Castile had led his\r\nchivalry to victory over the infidel, and national pride and religious\r\nenthusiasm were enlisted in winning for him the personal authority\r\nnecessary for a sovereign, which had been forfeited since the murder of\r\nPedro the Cruel had established the bastard line upon the throne. It was\r\nby such means as this, and not by the Inquisition that he started the\r\nmovement which converted feudal Spain into an absolute monarchy. His\r\nlife's work was seen in the success with which, against heavy odds, he\r\nlifted Spain from her obscurity in Europe to the foremost rank of\r\nChristian powers.\r\n\r\nYet amid the numerous acts of cruelty and duplicity which tarnish the\r\nmemory of Ferdinand as a statesman, examination of his correspondence\r\nwith his officials of the Inquisition, especially with those employed in\r\nthe odious business of confiscating the property of the unhappy victims,\r\nhas revealed to me an unexpectedly favorable aspect of his character.\r\nWhile urging them to diligence and thoroughness, his instructions are\r\ninvariably to decide all cases with rectitude and justice and to give no\r\none cause of complaint. While insisting on the subordination of the\r\npeople and the secular officials to the Holy Office, more than once we\r\nfind him intervening to check arbitrary action and to correct abuses\r\nand, when cases of peculiar hardship arising from confiscations are\r\nbrought to his notice, he frequently grants to widows and orphans a\r\nportion of the forfeited property. All this will come before us more\r\nfully hereafter and a single instance will suffice here to illustrate\r\nhis kindly disposition to his subjects. In a letter of October 20, 1502,\r\nhe recites that Domingo Muñoz of Calatayna has appealed to him for\r\nrelief, representing that his little property was burdened with an\r\nannual _censal_ or ground-rent of two sols eight dineros--part of a\r\nlarger one confiscated in the estate of Juan de Buendia, condemned for\r\nheresy--and he orders Juan Royz, his receiver of confiscations at\r\nSaragossa, to release the ground-rent and let Muñoz have his property\r\nunincumbered, giving as a reason that the latter is old and poor.[57] It\r\nshows Ferdinand's reputation among his subjects that such an appeal\r\nshould be ventured, and the very triviality of the matter renders it the\r\nmore impressive that a monarch, whose ceaseless personal activity was\r\ndevoted to the largest affairs of that tumultuous world, should turn\r\nfrom the complicated treachery of European politics to consider and\r\ngrant so humble a prayer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ISABELLA_]\r\n\r\nIn his successful career as a monarch he was well seconded by his queen.\r\nWithout deserving the exaggerated encomiums which have idealized her,\r\nIsabella was a woman exactly adapted to her environment. As we have\r\nseen, the _muger varonil_ was a not uncommon development of the period\r\nin Spain, and Isabella's youth, passed in the midst of civil broils,\r\nwith her fate more than once suspended in the balance, had strengthened\r\nand hardened the masculine element in her character. Self-reliant and\r\npossessed of both moral and physical courage, she was prompt and\r\ndecided, bearing with ease responsibilities that would have crushed a\r\nweaker nature and admirably fitted to cope with the fierce and turbulent\r\nnobles, who respected neither her station nor her sex and could be\r\nreduced to obedience only by a will superior to their own. She had the\r\ndefects of her qualities. She could not have been the queen she was\r\nwithout sacrifice of womanly softness, and she earned the reputation of\r\nbeing hard and unforgiving.[58] She could not be merciful when her task\r\nwas to reduce to order the wild turmoil and lawlessness which had so\r\nlong reigned unchecked in Castile, but in this she shed no blood\r\nwantonly and she knew how to pardon when policy dictated mercy. How she\r\nwon the affection of those in whom she confided can be readily\r\nunderstood from the feminine grace of her letters to her confessor,\r\nHernando of Talavera.[59] A less praiseworthy attribute of her sex was\r\nher fondness for personal adornment, in which she indulged in spite of a\r\nchronically empty treasury and a people overwhelmed with taxation. We\r\nhear of her magnifying her self-abnegation in receiving the French\r\nambassador twice in the same gown, while an attaché of the English envoy\r\nsays that he never saw her twice in the same attire, and that a single\r\ntoilet, with its jewels and appendages must have cost at least 200,000\r\ncrowns.[60] She was moreover rigidly tenacious of the royal dignity.\r\nOnce when Ferdinand was playing cards with some grandees, the Admiral of\r\nCastile, whose sister was Ferdinand's mother, addressed him repeatedly\r\nas \"nephew\"; Isabella was undressed in an inner room and heard it; she\r\nhastily gathered a garment around her, put her head through the door and\r\nrebuked him--\"Hold! my lord the king has no kindred or friends, he has\r\nservants and vassals.\"[61] She was deeply and sincerely religious,\r\nplacing almost unbounded confidence in her spiritual directors, whom she\r\nselected, not among courtly casuists to soothe her conscience, but from\r\namong the most rigid and unbending churchmen within her reach, and to\r\nthis may in part be attributed the fanaticism which led her to make such\r\nhavoc among her people. She was scrupulously regular in all church\r\nobservances; in addition to frequent prayers she daily recited the hours\r\nlike a priest, and her biographer tells us that, in spite of the\r\npressing cares of state, she seemed to lead a contemplative rather than\r\nan active life.[62] She was naturally just and upright, though, in the\r\ntortuous policy of the time, she had no hesitation in becoming the\r\naccomplice of Ferdinand's frequent duplicity and treachery. With all the\r\ncrowded activity of her eventful life, she found time to stimulate the\r\nculture despised by the warlike chivalry around her, and she took a deep\r\ninterest in an academy which, at her instance, was opened for the young\r\nnobles of her court by the learned Italian, Peter Martyr of\r\nAnghiera.[63]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ROYAL JURISDICTION_]\r\n\r\nIsabella recognized that the surest way to curb the disorders which\r\npervaded her kingdom was the vigorous enforcement of the law and, as\r\nsoon as the favorable aspect of the war of the succession gave leisure\r\nfor less pressing matters, she set earnestly to work to accomplish it.\r\nThe victory of Toro was followed immediately by the Córtes of Madrigal,\r\nApril 27, 1476, where far-reaching reforms were enacted, among which the\r\nadministration of justice and the vindication of the royal prerogatives\r\noccupied a conspicuous place.[64] It was not long before she gave her\r\npeople a practical illustration of her inflexible determination to\r\nenforce these reforms. In 1477 she visited Seville with her court and\r\npresided in public herself over the trial of malefactors. Complaints\r\ncame in thick and fast of murders and robberies committed in the bad old\r\ntimes; the criminals were summarily dispatched, and a great fear fell\r\nupon the whole population, for there was scarce a family or even an\r\nindividual who was not compromised. Multitudes fled and Seville bade\r\nfair to be depopulated when, at the supplication of a great crowd,\r\nheaded by Enrique de Guzman, Duke of Medina Sidonia, she proclaimed an\r\namnesty conditioned on the restitution of property, making, however, the\r\nsignificant exception of heresy.[65]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE_]\r\n\r\nFrom Seville she went, accompanied by Ferdinand, to Córdova. There they\r\nexecuted malefactors, compelled restitution of property, took possession\r\nof the castles of robber hidalgos, and left the land pacified. As\r\nopportunity allowed, in the busy years which followed, Isabella visited\r\nother portions of her dominions, from Valencia to Biscay and Galicia, on\r\nthe same errand and, when she could not appear in person, she sent\r\njudges around with full power to represent the crown, the influence of\r\nwhich was further extended when, in 1480, the royal officers known as\r\ncorregidores were appointed in all towns and cities.[66] One notable\r\ncase is recorded which impressed the whole nobility with salutary\r\nterror. In 1480 the widow of a scrivener appealed to her against Alvar\r\nYáñez, a rich caballero of Lugo in Galicia, who, to obtain possession of\r\na coveted property, caused the scrivener to forge a deed and then\r\nmurdered him to insure secrecy. It was probably this which led Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella to send to Galicia Fernando de Acuña as governor with an\r\narmed force, and Garcí López de Chinchilla as corregidor. Yáñez was\r\narrested and finally confessed and offered to purchase pardon with\r\n40,000 ducats to be applied to the Moorish wars. Isabella's counsellors\r\nadvised acceptance of the tempting sum for so holy a cause, but her\r\ninflexible sense of justice rejected it; she had the offender put to\r\ndeath, but to prove her disinterestedness she waived her claim to his\r\nforfeited estates and gave them to his children. Alvar Yáñez was but a\r\ntype of the lawless nobles of Galicia who, for a century, had been\r\naccustomed to slay and spoil without accountability to any one. So\r\ndesperate appeared the condition of the land that when, in 1480, the\r\ndeputies of the towns assembled to receive Acuña and Chinchilla they\r\ntold them that they would have to have powers from the King of Heaven as\r\nwell as from the earthly king to punish the evil doers of the land.[67]\r\nThe example made of Yáñez brought encouragement, but the work of\r\nrestoring order was slow. Even in 1482 the representatives of the towns\r\nof Galicia appealed to the sovereigns, stating that there had long been\r\nneither law nor justice there and begging that a _justizia mayor_ be\r\nappointed, armed with full powers to reduce the land to order. They\r\nespecially asked for the destruction of the numerous castles of those\r\nwho, having little land and few vassals to support them, lived by\r\nrobbery and pillage, and with them they classed the fortified churches\r\nheld by prelates. At the same time they represented that homicide had\r\nbeen so universal that, if all murderers were punished, the greater part\r\nof the land would be ruined, and they suggested that culprits be merely\r\nmade to serve at their own expense in the war with Granada.[68] With the\r\nsupport of the well-disposed, however, the royal power gradually made\r\nitself felt; they lent efficient support to the royal representatives;\r\nforty-six robber castles were razed and fifteen hundred robbers and\r\nmurderers fled from the province, which became comparatively peaceful\r\nand orderly--a change confirmed when, in 1486, Ferdinand and Isabella\r\nwent thither personally to complete the work. Yet it was not simply by\r\nspasmodic effort that the protection of the laws was secured for the\r\npopulation. Constant vigilance was exercised to see that the judges were\r\nstrict and impartial. In 1485, 1488 and 1490 we hear of searching\r\ninvestigations made into the action of all the corregidores of the\r\nkingdom to see that they administered justice without fear or favor.\r\n_Juezes de Residencia_, as they were called, armed with almost full\r\nroyal authority, were dispatched to all parts of the kingdom, as a\r\nregular system, to investigate and report on the conduct of all royal\r\nofficials, from governors down, with power to punish for injustice,\r\noppression, or corruption, subject always to appeal in larger cases to\r\nthe royal council, and the detailed instructions given to them show the\r\nminute care exercised over all details of administration. Bribery, also,\r\nwhich was almost universal in the courts, was summarily suppressed and\r\nall judges were forbidden to receive presents from suitors.[69] To\r\nmaintain constant watchfulness over them a secret service was organized\r\nof trustworthy inspectors who circulated throughout the land in disguise\r\nand furnished reports as to their proceedings and reputation.[70]\r\nAttention, moreover, was paid to the confused jurisprudence of the\r\nperiod. Since the confirmation of the _Siete Partidas_ of Alfonso X, in\r\n1348, and the issue at the same time of the _Ordenamiento de Alcalá_,\r\nthere had been countless laws and edicts published, some of them\r\nconflicting and many that had grown obsolete though still legally in\r\nforce. The greatest jurist of the day, Alfonso Diaz de Montalvo, was\r\nemployed to gather from these into a code all that were applicable to\r\nexisting conditions and further to supplement their deficiencies, and\r\nthis code, known as the _Ordenanzas Reales_, was accepted and confirmed\r\nby the Córtes of Toledo in 1480.[71] This reconstruction of Castilian\r\njurisprudence was completed for the time when, in 1491, Montalvo brought\r\nout an edition of the _Siete Partidas_, noting what provisions had\r\nbecome obsolete and adding what was necessary of the more modern laws.\r\nThe result of all these strenuous labors is seen in the admiring\r\nexclamation of Peter Martyr, in 1492, \"Thus we have peace and concord,\r\nhitherto unknown in Spain. Justice, which seems to have abandoned other\r\nlands, pervades these kingdoms.\"[72] The inestimable benefits resulting\r\nfrom this are probably due more especially to Isabella.\r\n\r\nYet I have been led to the conviction that her share in the\r\nadministration of her kingdom has been exaggerated. The chroniclers of\r\nthe period were for the most part Castilians who would naturally seek to\r\nsubordinate the action of the Aragonese intruder, and subsequent\r\nwriters, in their eagerness to magnify the reputation of Isabella, have\r\nfollowed the example. In the copious royal correspondence with the\r\nofficials of the Inquisition the name of Isabella rarely appears. To\r\nthose in Castile as in Aragon Ferdinand mostly writes in the first\r\nperson singular, without even using the _pluralis majestatis_; the\r\nreceiver of confiscations is _mi receptor_, the royal treasury is _mi\r\ncamera e fisco_; the Council of the Inquisition is _mi consejo_. In\r\nspite of the agreement of 1474, the signature _Yo la Reina_ rarely\r\nappears alongside of _Yo el Rey_, and still rarer are Ferdinand's\r\nallusions to _la Serenissima Reina, mi muy cara e muy amada muger_,\r\nwhile in the occasional letters issued by Isabella during her husband's\r\nabsence, she is careful to adduce his authority as that of _el Rey mi\r\nseñor_.[73] It is scarce likely that this preponderance of Ferdinand was\r\nconfined to directing the affairs of the Holy Office.\r\n\r\nThere has been a tendency of late to regard the Inquisition as a\r\npolitical engine for the conversion of Spain from a medieval feudal\r\nmonarchy to one of the modern absolute type, but this is an error. The\r\nchange effected by Ferdinand and Isabella and confirmed by their\r\ngrandson Charles V was almost wholly wrought, as it had been two\r\ncenturies earlier in France, by the extension and enforcement of the\r\nroyal jurisdiction, superseding that of the feudatories.[74] In Castile\r\nthe latter had virtually ceased to be an instrument of good during the\r\nlong period of turbulence which preceded the accession of Isabella;\r\nsomething evidently was needed to fill the gap; the zealous and\r\nefficient administration of justice, which I have described, not only\r\nrestored order to the community but went far to exalt the royal power,\r\nand, while it abased the nobles, it reconciled the people to possible\r\nusurpations which were so beneficent. In the consolidation and\r\nmaintenance of this no agency was so effective as the institution known\r\nas the _Santa Hermandad_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LA SANTA HERMANDAD_]\r\n\r\nHermandades--brotherhoods or associations for the maintenance of public\r\npeace and private rights--were no new thing. In the troubles of 1282,\r\ncaused by the rebellion of Sancho IV against his father, the first idea\r\nof his supporters seems to have been the formation of such\r\norganizations.[75] In these associations, however, the police functions\r\nwere subordinated to the political object of supporting the pretensions\r\nof Sancho IV and, recognizing their danger, he dissolved them as soon as\r\nhe felt the throne assured to him. After his death, his widow the regent\r\nDoña María de Molina, organized them anew for the protection of her\r\nchild, Fernando IV, and again in 1315, when she was a second time regent\r\nin the minority of her grandson, Alfonso XI.[76]\r\n\r\nThe idea was a fruitful one and speedily came to be recognized as a\r\npotent instrumentality in the struggle with local disorder and violence.\r\nPerhaps the earliest Hermandad of a purely police character, similar to\r\nthe later ones, was that entered into in 1302 between Toledo, Talavera\r\nand Villareal to repress the robberies and murders committed by the\r\n_Golfines_ in the district of Xara. Fernando IV not only confirmed the\r\nassociation but ordered the inhabitants to render it due assistance, and\r\nsubsequent royal letters of the same purport were issued in 1303, 1309,\r\n1312 and 1315.[77] In 1386 Juan I framed a general law providing for the\r\norganization and functions of Hermandades, but if any were formed under\r\nit at the time they have left no traces of their activity. In 1418 this\r\nlaw was adopted as the constitution of one which organized itself in\r\nSantiago, but this accomplished little and, in 1421, the guilds and\r\nconfraternities of the city united in another for mutual support and\r\nsuccor.[78] There was, in fact, at this time, at least nominally, a\r\ngeneral Hermandad, probably organized under the statute of Juan I and\r\npossessing written charters and privileges and customs and revenues,\r\nwith full jurisdiction to try and condemn offenders. It commanded little\r\nrespect, however, for it complained, in 1418, to Juan II of interference\r\nwith its revenues and work, in response to which Juan vigorously\r\nprohibited all royal and local judges and officials from impeding the\r\nHermandades in any manner. The continuity, nominal at least, of this\r\nwith subsequent organizations is shown by the confirmation of this\r\nutterance by Juan II in 1423, by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1485, by\r\nJuana la Loca in 1512 and 1518, by Philip II in 1561, by Philip III in\r\n1601 and by Philip IV in 1621.[79] In the increasing disorder of the\r\ntimes, however, it was impossible, at that period, to maintain the\r\nefficiency of the body. In 1443 an attempt was made to reconstruct it,\r\nbut as soon as it endeavored to repress the lawless nobles and laid\r\nsiege to Pedro López de Ayala in Salvatierra its forces were cut to\r\npieces and dispersed by Pedro Fernández de Velasco.[80] Some twenty\r\nyears later, in 1465, when the disorders under Henry IV were\r\nculminating, another effort was made. The suffering people organized and\r\ntaxed themselves to raise a force of 1800 horsemen to render the roads\r\nsafe, and they endeavored to bring the number up to 3000. It was a\r\npopular movement against the nobles and the king hailed it as the work\r\nof God who was lifting up the humble against the great. He empowered\r\nthem to administer justice without appeal except to himself, he told\r\nthem that they had well earned the name of _Santa Hermandad_ and he\r\nurged them earnestly to go forward in the good work. The attempt had\r\nconsiderable success for a time, but it soon languished and was\r\ndissolved for lack of the means required to carry it on.[81] Again, in\r\n1473, there was another endeavor to form a Hermandad, but the anarchical\r\nforces were too dominant for its successful organization.[82]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LA SANTA HERMANDAD_]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the victory of Toro, in March, 1476, gave promise of settled\r\ngovernment, the idea of reviving the Hermandades occurred to Alfonso de\r\nQuintanilla, Contador Mayor, or Chief Auditor, of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella. With their approval he broached the subject to leading\r\ncitizens of the principal towns in Leon and Old Castile; deputies were\r\nsent to meet at Dueñas and the project was debated. So many obstacles\r\npresented themselves that it would have been abandoned but for an\r\neloquent argument by Quintanilla. His plan was adopted, but so fearful\r\nwere the deputies that the taxes necessary for its maintenance might\r\nbecome permanent that they limited its duration to three years. Under\r\nthe impulse of the sovereigns it rapidly took shape and was organized\r\nwith the Duke of Villahermosa, natural brother of Ferdinand, at its\r\nhead.[83] No time was lost in extending it throughout the kingdoms, in\r\nspite of resistance on the part of those who regarded with well-founded\r\napprehension not only its efficiency as a means of coercing malefactors\r\nbut as a dangerous development of the royal power. Seville, for\r\ninstance, recalcitrated and only yielded to a peremptory command from\r\nIsabella in June, 1477.[84] One of the reasons assigned, in 1507, by\r\nFerdinand for assenting to the demoralizing arrangement under which the\r\nArchbishop of Compostella resigned his see in favor of his natural son,\r\nwas that he had received the royal judges and the Hermandad throughout\r\nhis province, in opposition to the will of the nobles and gentry.[85]\r\nWhen, in 1479, Alonso Carrillo and the Marquis of Villena made a final\r\nattempt to urge the King of Portugal to another invasion of Castile, one\r\nof the arguments advanced was the hatred entertained for Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella in consequence of the taxes levied to support the three\r\nthousand horsemen of the Hermandad.[86] In some provinces the resistance\r\nwas obstinate. In 1479 we find Isabella writing to the authorities of\r\nBiscay, expressing surprise at the neglect of the royal orders and\r\nthreatening condign punishment for further delay, notwithstanding which\r\nrepeated commands were requisite, and it was not till 1488 that the\r\nstubborn Biscayans submitted, while soon afterward complaints came from\r\nGuipuzcoa that the local courts neutralized it by admitting appeals from\r\nits sentences.[87] It was in the same year that Ferdinand obtained from\r\nthe Córtes of Saragossa assent to the introduction of the Hermandad in\r\nhis kingdom of Aragon, but the Aragonese, always jealous of the royal\r\npower, chafed under it for, in December, 1493, Isabella, writing from\r\nSaragossa, expresses a fear that the Córtes may suppress it, though it\r\nis the only means of enforcing justice there, and in the Córtes of\r\nMonçon, in 1510, Ferdinand was obliged to approve a _fuero_ abolishing\r\nit and forbidding for the future anything of the kind to be\r\nestablished.[88] In 1490 the independent kingdom of Navarre adopted the\r\nsystem and co-operated with its neighbors by allowing malefactors to be\r\nfollowed across the border and extraditing them when caught--even\r\nabsconding debtors being thus tracked and surrendered.[89] The\r\ninstitution thus founded was watched with Isabella's customary care. In\r\n1483 complaints arose of bribery and extortion, when she summoned a\r\nconvention at Pinto of representatives from all the provinces, where the\r\nguilty were punished and abuses were reformed.[90]\r\n\r\nThe Santa Hermandad thus formed a mounted military police which covered\r\nthe whole kingdom, under the Duke of Villahermosa, who appointed the\r\ncaptains and summoned the force to any point where trouble was\r\nthreatened. Each centre of population elected two alcaldes, one a\r\ngentleman and the other a tax-payer or commoner, and levied a tax to\r\ndefray the expense of the organization. The alcaldes selected the\r\n_quadrilleros_, or privates, and held courts which dispensed summary\r\njustice to delinquents, bound by no formalities and required to listen\r\nto no legal pleadings. Their decision was final, save an appeal to the\r\nthrone; their jurisdiction extended over all crimes of violence and\r\ntheft and they could inflict stripes, mutilation, or death by shooting\r\nwith arrows. The quadrillero in pursuit of an offender was required to\r\nfollow him for five leagues, raising the hue and cry as he went, and\r\njoined by those of the country through which he passed, who kept up the\r\nhunt until the fugitive was either caught or driven beyond the\r\nfrontier.[91]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LA SANTA HERMANDAD_]\r\n\r\nGreat as were the services of the Hermandad in repressing the turbulence\r\nof the nobles and rendering the roads safe, its cost was a source of\r\ncomplaint to the communities which defrayed it. This was by no means\r\nsmall; in 1485 it was computed at 32,000,000 maravedís and subsequently\r\nit increased greatly; it was met by a tax of 18,000 maravedís on every\r\nhundred hearths and the money was not handled by the communities but was\r\npaid to the crown.[92] Nominally the organization was in their hands,\r\nbut virtually it was controlled by the sovereigns, and when, in 1498,\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, with an appearance of generosity, relieved the\r\ntaxpayers and assumed to meet the expenses from the royal revenues,\r\nalthough they left the election of the alcaldes and quadrilleros in the\r\nhands of the local populations, yet the result was inevitable in\r\nsubjecting it still more closely to the crown.[93] The institution\r\nbecame permanent, and its modern development is seen in the _guarda\r\ncivil_. None of the reforms of Ferdinand and Isabella was so efficient\r\nin restoring order and none did more to centralize power. It was not\r\nonly a rudimentary standing army which could be concentrated speedily to\r\nsuppress disorder, but it carried the royal jurisdiction into every\r\ncorner of the land and made the royal authority supreme everywhere. It\r\nwas practically an alliance between the crown and the people against the\r\ncentrifugal forces of feudalism, without which even the policy of\r\nFerdinand and the iron firmness of Ximenes might have failed to win in\r\nthe final struggle. When municipal independence likewise perished in the\r\ndefeat of the Comunidades, the only power left standing in Spain was\r\nthat of the throne, which thus became absolute and all-pervading. The\r\nnew absolutism was embodied in the self-effacing declaration of the\r\nCórtes of Valladolid, in 1523, to Charles V, that the laws and customs\r\nwere subject to the king, who could make and revoke them at his\r\npleasure, for he was the living law.[94] How immense was the revolution\r\nand how speedily accomplished is seen in the contrast between the time\r\nwhen the Count of Benavente jeered at a royal safe-conduct and the\r\npeople of Galicia scarce dared to receive a royal commissioner, and some\r\nsixty years later when, in the unruly Basque provinces, the people of\r\nSan Sebastian, in 1536, appealed to the Emperor Charles V to relieve\r\nthem from local nuisances, and royal letters were gravely issued\r\nforbidding the butchers of that town from erecting new stalls or\r\nskinning cattle in the streets and restricting the latter operation to\r\nplaces duly assigned for the purpose.[95] Thus the crown had become\r\nabsolute and its interposition could be invoked for the minutest details\r\nof local government. He reads history to little purpose who imagines\r\nthat this was the work of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nAnother measure of no little importance in establishing the royal\r\nsupremacy was the virtual incorporation in the crown of the masterships\r\nof the three great military Orders of Santiago, of Calatrava and of\r\nAlcántara. Under Henry IV a Master of Santiago had been able to keep the\r\nwhole kingdom in confusion, and the wealth and power of the others,\r\nalthough not so great, were sufficient to render their chiefs the equals\r\nof the highest nobles. From Innocent VIII, in 1489, Ferdinand procured a\r\nbrief granting him for life the administration of all three; and in her\r\nwill Isabella bequeathed to him an annual income of ten millions of\r\nmaravedís from their revenues.[96] As Ferdinand's death drew near, the\r\nOrders endeavored to be released from subjection, claiming that they\r\ncould be governed only by their own members, but prudent care secured in\r\ntime from Leo X the succession in the masterships to Charles V, who,\r\nafter Leo's death, made haste to obtain from Adrian VI a bull which\r\nannexed them in perpetuity to the crown.[97]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that a king so far-seeing and politic as Ferdinand and\r\na queen so pious as Isabella, when reducing to order the chaos which\r\nthey found in Castile, should neglect the interest of the faith on\r\nwhich, according to medieval belief, all social order was based. There\r\nwere in fact burning religious questions which, to sensitive piety,\r\nmight seem even more urgent than protection to life and property. To\r\ncomprehend the intricacy of the situation will require a somewhat\r\nextended retrospect into the relations between the several races\r\noccupying the Peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE JEWS AND THE MOORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe influences under which human character can be modified, for good or\r\nfor evil, are abundantly illustrated in the conversion of the Spaniards\r\nfrom the most tolerant to the most intolerant nation in Europe.\r\nApologists may seek to attribute the hatred felt for Jews and Moors and\r\nheretics, in the Spain of the fifteenth and succeeding centuries, to an\r\ninborn peculiarity of the race--a _cosa de España_ which must be\r\naccepted as a fact and requires no explanation,[98] but such facts have\r\ntheir explanation, and it is the business of the expositor of history to\r\ntrace them to their causes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe vicissitudes endured by the Jewish race, from the period when\r\nChristianity became dominant, may well be a subject of pride to the\r\nHebrew and of shame to the Christian. The annals of mankind afford no\r\nmore brilliant instance of steadfastness under adversity, of\r\nunconquerable strength through centuries of hopeless oppression, of\r\ninexhaustible elasticity in recuperating from apparent destruction, and\r\nof conscientious adherence to a faith whose only portion in this life\r\nwas contempt and suffering. Nor does the long record of human perversity\r\npresent a more damning illustration of the facility with which the evil\r\npassions of man can justify themselves with the pretext of duty, than\r\nthe manner in which the Church, assuming to represent Him who died to\r\nredeem mankind, deliberately planted the seeds of intolerance and\r\npersecution and assiduously cultivated the harvest for nearly fifteen\r\nhundred years. It was in vain that Jesus on the cross had said \"Father,\r\nforgive them, for they know not what they do\"; it was in vain that St.\r\nPeter was recorded as urging, in excuse for the Crucifixion, \"And now,\r\nbrethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your\r\nrulers\"; the Church taught that, short of murder, no punishment, no\r\nsuffering, no obloquy was too severe for the descendants of those who\r\nhad refused to recognize the Messiah, and had treated him as a rebel\r\nagainst human and divine authority. Under the canon law the Jew was a\r\nbeing who had scarce the right to existence and could only enjoy it\r\nunder conditions of virtual slavery. As recently as 1581, Gregory XIII\r\ndeclared that the guilt of the race in rejecting and crucifying Christ\r\nonly grows deeper with successive generations, entailing on its members\r\nperpetual servitude, and this authoritative assertion was embodied in an\r\nappendix to the Corpus Juris.[99] When Paramo, about the same period,\r\nsought to justify the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, he had\r\nno difficulty in citing canons to prove that Ferdinand and Isabella\r\ncould righteously have seized all their property and have sold their\r\nbodies into slavery.[100] Man is ready enough to oppress and despoil his\r\nfellows and, when taught by his religious guides that justice and\r\nhumanity are a sin against God, spoliation and oppression become the\r\neasiest of duties. It is not too much to say that for the infinite\r\nwrongs committed on the Jews during the Middle Ages, and for the\r\nprejudices that are even yet rife in many quarters, the Church is mainly\r\nif not wholly responsible. It is true that occasionally she lifted her\r\nvoice in mild remonstrance when some massacre occurred more atrocious\r\nthan usual, but these massacres were the direct outcome of the hatred\r\nand contempt which she so zealously inculcated, and she never took steps\r\nby punishment to prevent their repetition. Alonso de Espina merely\r\nrepeats the currently received orthodox ethics of the subject when he\r\ntells us that to oppress the Jew is true kindness and piety, for when he\r\nfinds that his impiety brings suffering he will be led to the fear of\r\nGod and that he who makes another do right is greater in the sight of\r\nGod than he who does right himself.[101]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DEVELOPMENT OF INTOLERANCE_]\r\n\r\nIn view of Spanish abhorrence of Jews and Saracens during the last five\r\nor six centuries it is a fact worthy of note that the Spanish nations of\r\nthe medieval period were the latest to yield to this impulsion of the\r\nChurch. The explanation of this lies partly in the relations between the\r\nseveral races in the Peninsula and partly in the independent attitude\r\nwhich Spain maintained towards the Holy See and its indisposition to\r\nsubmit to the dictation of the Church. To appreciate fully the\r\ntransformation which culminated in the establishment of the Inquisition,\r\nand to understand the causes leading to it, will require a brief review\r\nof the position occupied by the Jew and the Saracen towards the Church\r\nand the State.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PROGRESSIVE INTOLERANCE_]\r\n\r\nIn the primitive Church there would seem to have been a feeling of\r\nequality, if not of cordiality, between Christian and Jew. When it was\r\ndeemed necessary, in the Apostolic canons, to forbid bishops and priests\r\nand deacons, as well as laymen, from fasting or celebrating feasts with\r\nJews, or partaking of their unleavened bread, or giving oil to their\r\nsynagogues, or lighting their lamps, this argues that kindly intercourse\r\nbetween them was only to be restricted in so far as it might lead to\r\nreligious fellowship.[102] This kindly intercourse continued but, as the\r\nChurch became mostly Gentile in its membership, the prejudices existing\r\nagainst the Jew in the Gentile world gathered strength until there\r\nbecomes manifest a tendency to treat him as an outcast. Early in the\r\nfourth century the council of Elvira, held under the lead of the\r\nuncompromising Hosius of Córdova, forbade marriage between Christians\r\nand Jews, because there could be no society common to the faithful and\r\nthe infidel; no farmer was to have his harvest blest by a Jew, nor was\r\nany one even to eat with him.[103] St. Augustin was not quite so rigid,\r\nfor while he held it lawful to dissolve marriage between the Christian\r\nand the infidel, he argued that it was inexpedient.[104][105] St.\r\nAmbrose was one of the earliest to teach proscription when he reproved\r\nTheodosius the Great for the favor shown by him to Jews, who slew Christ\r\nand who deny God in denying his Son, and St. John Chrysostom improved on\r\nthis by publicly preaching that Christians should hold no intercourse\r\nwith Jews, whose souls were the habitations of demons and whose\r\nsynagogues were their playgrounds.[106] The antagonism thus stimulated\r\nfound its natural expression, in 415, in the turbulent city of\r\nAlexandria, where quarrels arose resulting in the shedding of Christian\r\nblood, when St. Cyril took advantage of the excitement by leading a mob\r\nto the synagogues, of which he took possession, and then abandoned the\r\nproperty of the Jews to pillage and expelled them from the city, which\r\nthey had inhabited since its foundation by Alexander.[107] That under\r\nsuch impulsion these excesses were common is shown by the frequent\r\nrepetition of imperial edicts forbidding the maltreatment of Jews and\r\nthe spoiling and burning of their synagogues; they were not allowed to\r\nerect new ones but were to be maintained in possession of those\r\nexisting. At the same time the commencement of legal disabilities is\r\nmanifested in the reiterated prohibitions of the holding of Christian\r\nslaves by Jews, while confiscation and perpetual exile or death were\r\nthreatened against Jews who should convert or circumcise Christians or\r\nmarry Christian wives.[108] The Church held it to be a burning disgrace\r\nthat a Jew should occupy a position of authority over Christians; in 438\r\nit procured from Theodosius II the enactment of this as a fixed\r\nprinciple, and we shall see how earnestly it labored to render this a\r\npart of the public law of Christendom.[109] This spirit received a check\r\nfrom the Arianism of the Gothic conquerors of the Western Empire.\r\nTheodoric ordered the privileges of the Jews to be strictly preserved,\r\namong which was the important one that all quarrels between themselves\r\nshould be settled by their own judges, and he sternly repressed all\r\npersecution. When a mob in Rome burned a synagogue he commanded the\r\npunishment of the perpetrators in terms of severe displeasure; when\r\nattempts were made to invade the right of the Jews of Genoa he\r\nintervened effectually, and when in Milan the clergy endeavored to\r\nobtain possession of the synagogue he peremptorily forbade it.[110] So\r\nlong as the Wisigoths remained Arian this spirit prevailed throughout\r\ntheir extensive dominions, although the orthodox were allowed to indulge\r\ntheir growing uncharitableness. When the council of Agde, in 506,\r\nforbade the faithful to banquet or even to eat with Jews it shows that\r\nsocial intercourse still existed but that it was condemned by those who\r\nruled the Church.[111] In the East the same tendency had freer\r\nopportunity of expressing itself in legislation, as when, in 706, the\r\ncouncil of Constantinople forbade Christians to live with Jews or to\r\nbathe with them, to eat their unleavened bread, to consult them as\r\nphysicians or to take their medicines.[112]\r\n\r\nGregory the Great was too large-minded to approve of this growing spirit\r\nof intolerance and, when some zealots in Naples attempted to prevent the\r\nJews from celebrating their feasts, he intervened with a peremptory\r\nprohibition of such interference, arguing that it would not conduce to\r\ntheir conversion and that they should be led by kindness and not by\r\nforce to embrace the faith, all of which was embodied in the canon law\r\nto become conspicuous through its non-observance.[113] In fact, his\r\nrepeated enunciation of the precept shows how little it was regarded\r\neven in his own time.[114] When, moreover, large numbers of Jews were\r\ncompelled to submit to baptism in southern Gaul he wrote reprovingly to\r\nthe Bishops Virgil of Arles and Theodore of Marseilles, but this did not\r\nprevent St. Avitus of Clermont, about the same time, from baptizing\r\nabout five hundred, who thus saved their lives from the fanatic fury of\r\nthe populace.[115]\r\n\r\nThese forced conversions in Gothia were the first fruits of the change\r\nof religion of the Wisigoths from Arianism to Catholicism. The\r\nOstrogoths, Theodoric and Theodatus, had expressly declared that they\r\ncould not interfere with the religion of their subjects, for no one can\r\nbe forced unwillingly to believe.[116] The Wisigoths, who dominated\r\nsouthern Gaul and Spain, when adapting the Roman law to suit their\r\nneeds, had contented themselves with punishing by confiscation the\r\nChristian who turned Jew, with liberating Christian slaves held by Jews,\r\nand with inflicting the death penalty on Jewish masters who should force\r\nChristian slaves to conversion, besides preserving the law of Theodosius\r\nII prohibiting Jews from holding office or building new synagogues.[117]\r\nThis was by no means full toleration, but it was merciful in comparison\r\nwith what followed the conversion of the Goths to Catholicism. The\r\nchange commenced promptly, though it did not at once reach its full\r\nseverity. The third council of Toledo, held in May, 589, to condemn the\r\nArian heresy and to settle the details of the conversion, adopted canons\r\nwhich show how free had hitherto been the intercourse between the races.\r\nJews were forbidden to have Christian wives or concubines or servants,\r\nand all children sprung from such unions were to be baptized; any\r\nChristian slave circumcised or polluted with Jewish rites was to be set\r\nfree; no Jew was to hold an office in which he could inflict punishment\r\non a Christian, and this action was followed by some further\r\ndisabilities decreed by the council of Narbonne in December of the same\r\nyear.[118] That freedom of discussion continued for some time is\r\nmanifested by the audacity of a Jew named Froganis, not long afterwards,\r\nwho, as we are told, in the presence of all the nobles of the court,\r\nexalted the synagogue and depreciated the Church; it was easier perhaps\r\nto close his mouth than to confute him, for Aurasius, Bishop of Toledo,\r\nexcommunicated him and declared him anathematized by the Father, Son and\r\nHoly Ghost and by all the celestial hierarchy and cohorts.[119]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE JEWS UNDER THE WISIGOTHS_]\r\n\r\nThe greatest churchman of the day, St. Isidor of Seville, whose career\r\nof forty years commenced with the Catholic revolution, did what in him\r\nlay to stimulate and justify persecution. His treatise against the Jews\r\nis not vituperative, as are so many later controversial writings, but he\r\nproves that they are condemned for their fathers' sins to dispersion and\r\noppression until, at the end of the world, their eyes are to be opened\r\nand they are to believe.[120] That he should have felt called upon to\r\ncompose such a work was an evil sign, and still more evil were the\r\nconclusions which he taught. They could not fail of deplorable results,\r\nas was seen when Sisebut ascended the throne in 612 and signalized the\r\ncommencement of his reign by a forcible conversion of all the Jews of\r\nthe kingdom. What means he adopted we are not told, but of course they\r\nwere violent, which St. Isidor mildly reproves, seeing that conversion\r\nought to be sincere, but which yet he holds to be strictly within the\r\ncompetence of the Church.[121] The Church in fact was thus brought face\r\nto face with the question whether the forcible propagation of the faith\r\nis lawful. This is so repugnant to the teachings of Christ that it could\r\nscarce be accepted, but, on the other hand, the sacrament of baptism is\r\nindelible, so the convenient doctrine was adopted and became the settled\r\npolicy that, while Christianity was not to be spread by force, unwilling\r\nconverts were nevertheless Christians; they were not to be permitted to\r\napostatize and were subject to all the pains and penalties of heresy for\r\nany secret inclination to their own religion.[122] This fruitful\r\nconception led to infinite misery, as we shall see hereafter, and was\r\nthe impelling motive which created the Spanish Inquisition.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the extent and the success of Sisebut's measures,\r\nthe Jews soon afterwards reappear, and they and the _conversos_ became\r\nthe subject of an unintermittent series of ecclesiastical and secular\r\nlegislation which shows that the policy so unfortunately adopted could\r\nonly have attained its end by virtual extermination. The anvil bade fair\r\nto wear out the hammer--the constancy of the persecuted exhausted the\r\ningenuity of the persecutor. With the conversion to Catholicism\r\necclesiastics became dominant throughout the Wisigothic territories and\r\nto their influence is attributable the varied series of measures which\r\noccupied the attention of the successive councils of Toledo from 633\r\nuntil the Saracenic invasion in 711. Every expedient was tried--the\r\nseizure of all Jewish children, to be shut up in monasteries or to be\r\ngiven to God-fearing Christians; the alternative of expulsion or\r\nconversion, to the enforcement of which all kings at their accession\r\nwere to take a solemn oath; the gentle persuasives of shaving,\r\nscourging, confiscation and exile. That the people at large did not\r\nshare in the intolerance of their rulers is seen in the prohibitions of\r\nsocial intercourse, mixed marriages, and the holding of office. The\r\nspectre of proselytism was evoked in justification of these measures as\r\nthough the persecuted Jew would seek to incur its dangers even had not\r\nthe Talmud declared that \"a proselyte is as damaging to Israel as an\r\nulcer to a healthy body.\" The enforced conversions thus obtained were\r\nregarded naturally with suspicion and the converts were the subjects of\r\nperpetual animadversion.[123]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE JEWS UNDER THE WISIGOTHS_]\r\n\r\nThus the Church had triumphed and the toleration of the Arian Goths had\r\nbeen converted into persecuting orthodoxy. History repeats itself and,\r\neight hundred years later, we shall see the same process with the same\r\nresults. Toleration was changed into persecution; conversions obtained\r\nby force, or by its equivalent, irresistible pressure, were recognized\r\nas fictitious, and the unfortunate converts were held guilty of the\r\nunpardonable crime of apostasy. Although the Goths did not invent the\r\nInquisition, they came as near to it as the rudeness of the age and the\r\nlooseness of their tottering political organization would permit, by\r\nendeavoring to create through the priesthood a network of supervision\r\nwhich should attain the same results. The Inquisition was prefigured and\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nAs apparently the Jews could not be exterminated or the Conversos be\r\ntrained into willing Christians, the two classes naturally added an\r\nelement of discontent to the already unquiet and motley population\r\nconsisting of superimposed layers of Goths, Romans and Celtiberians. The\r\nJews doubtless aided the Gallo-Roman rebellion of Flavius Paulus about\r\n675, for St. Julian of Toledo, in describing its suppression by King\r\nWamba, denounces Gaul in the bitterest terms, ending with the crowning\r\nreproach that it is a refuge for the blasphemy of the Jews, whom Wamba\r\nbanished after his triumph.[124] In spite of the unremitting efforts for\r\ntheir destruction, they still remained a source of danger to the State.\r\nAt the council of Toledo in 694, King Egiza appealed to his prelates to\r\ndevise some means by which Judaism should be wiped out, or all Jews be\r\nsubjected to the sword of justice and their property be appropriated,\r\nfor all efforts to convert them had proved futile and there was danger\r\nthat, in conjunction with their brethren in other lands, they would\r\noverthrow Christianity. In its response the council alludes to a\r\nconspiracy by which the Jews had endeavored to occupy the throne and\r\nbring about the ruin of the land, and it decrees that all Jews, with\r\ntheir wives, children and posterity, shall be reduced to perpetual\r\nservitude, while their property is declared confiscated to the king.\r\nThey are to be transferred from their present abodes and be given to\r\nsuch persons as the king may designate, who shall hold them as slaves so\r\nlong as they persevere in their faith, taking from them their children\r\nas they reach the age of seven and marrying them only to Christians.\r\nSuch of their Christian slaves as the king may select shall receive a\r\nportion of the confiscated property and continue to pay the taxes\r\nhitherto levied on the Jews.[125]\r\n\r\nDoubtless this inhuman measure led to indiscriminate plunder and\r\ninfinite misery, but its object was not accomplished. The Jews remained,\r\nand when came the catastrophe of the Saracen conquest they were ready\r\nenough to welcome the Berber invaders. That they were still in Spain is\r\nattributed to Witiza, who reigned from 700 to 710 and who is said to\r\nhave recalled them and favored them with privileges greater than those\r\nof the Church, but Witiza, though a favorite target for the abuse of\r\nlater annalists, was an excellent prince and the best contemporary\r\nauthority says nothing of his favoring the Jews.[126]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MOZÁRABES_]\r\n\r\nIf the Jews helped the Moslem, as we may readily believe, both from the\r\nprobabilities of the case and the testimony of Spanish and Arab\r\nwriters,[127] they did no more than a large portion of the Christians.\r\nTo the mass of the population the Goths were merely barbarous masters,\r\nwhose yoke they were ready to exchange for that of the Moors, nor were\r\nthe Goths themselves united. At the decisive battle of Xeres de la\r\nFrontera, Don Roderic's right and left wings were commanded by Sisebert\r\nand Oppas, the dethroned sons of Witiza, who fled without striking a\r\nblow, for the purpose of causing his defeat. The land was occupied by\r\nthe Moors with little resistance, and on terms easy to the conquered. It\r\nis true that, where resistance was made, the higher classes were reduced\r\nto slavery, the lands were divided among the soldiery and one-fifth was\r\nreserved to the State, on which peasants were settled subject to an\r\nimpost of one-third of the product, but submission was general under\r\ncapitulations which secured to the inhabitants the possession of their\r\nproperty, subject to the impost of a third, and allowed them the\r\nenjoyment of their laws and religion under native counts and bishops. In\r\nspite of this liberality, vast numbers embraced Mohammedanism, partly\r\nto avoid taxation and partly through conviction that the marvellous\r\nsuccess of the Moslem cause was a proof of its righteousness.[128]\r\n\r\nThe hardy resolution of the few who preferred exile and independence,\r\nand who found refuge in the mountains of Galicia and Asturias preserved\r\nthe Peninsula from total subjection to Islam. During the long struggle\r\nof the Reconquest, the social and religious condition of Spain was\r\nstrangely anomalous, presenting a mixture of races and faiths whose\r\nrelations, however antagonistic they might be in principle, were, for\r\nthe most part, dominated by temporal interests exclusively. Mutual\r\nattrition, so far from inflaming prejudices, led to mutual toleration,\r\nso that fanaticism became reduced to a minimum precisely in that corner\r\nof Christendom where _a priori_ reasoners have been tempted to regard it\r\nas especially violent.\r\n\r\nThe Saracens long maintained the policy adopted in the conquest and made\r\nno attempt to convert their Christian subjects, just as in the Levantine\r\nprovinces the Christians, although oppressed, were allowed to retain\r\ntheir religion, and in Persia, after the fall of the Sassanids, Parsism\r\ncontinued to exist for centuries and only died out gradually.[129] In\r\nfact, the condition of the Mozárabes, or subject Christians, under the\r\ncaliphs of Córdova was, for the most part, preferable to what it had\r\nbeen under the Gothic kings. Mozárabes were frequently in command of the\r\nMoslem armies; they formed the royal body-guard and were employed as\r\nsecretaries in the highest offices of state. In time they so completely\r\nlost the Latin tongue that it became necessary to translate the\r\nscripture and the canons into Arabic.[130] The Church organization was\r\nmaintained, with its hierarchy of prelates, who at times assembled in\r\ncouncils; there was sufficient intellectual activity for occasional\r\nheresies to spring up and be condemned, like those of Hostegesis and\r\nMigetio in the ninth century, while, half a century earlier, the bull of\r\nAdrian I, addressed to the orthodox bishops of Spain and denouncing the\r\nAdoptianism of Felix of Urgel, which was upheld by Elipandus, Archbishop\r\nof Toledo, shows the freedom of intercourse existing between the\r\nMozárabes and the rest of Christendom.[131] We hear of S. Eulogio of\r\nCórdova, whose two brothers, Alvar and Isidor, had left Spain and taken\r\nservice with the Emperor Louis le Germanique; he set out in 850 to join\r\nthem, but was stopped at Pampeluna by war and returned by way of\r\nSaragossa, bringing with him a number of books, including Virgil,\r\nHorace, Juvenal, Porphyry, the epigrams of Aldhelm and the fables of\r\nAvienus.[132] Mixed marriages seem not to have been uncommon and there\r\nwere frequent instances of conversion from either faith, but Mozárabic\r\nzealots abused the Moslem tolerance by publicly decrying Islam and\r\nmaking proselytes, which was forbidden, and a sharp persecution arose\r\nunder Abderrhaman II and Mahomet I, in which there were a number of\r\nvictims, including San Eulogio, who was martyred in 859.[133]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MOZÁRABES_]\r\n\r\nThis persecution gave rise to an incident which illustrates the friendly\r\nintercourse between Christian and Saracen. In 858, Hilduin, Abbot of S.\r\nGermain-des-Prés, under the auspices of Charles le Chauve, sent two\r\nmonks to Spain to procure the relics of St. Vincent. On reaching\r\nLanguedoc they learned that his body had been carried to Benevento, but\r\nthey also heard of the persecution at Córdova and were delighted,\r\nknowing that there must be plenty of relics to be obtained. They\r\ntherefore kept on to Barcelona, where Sunifred, the next in command to\r\nthe count, commended them to Abdulivar, Prince of Saragossa, with whom\r\nhe had intimate relations. From Saragossa they reached Córdova, where\r\nthe Mozárabic Bishop Saul received them kindly and assisted them in\r\nobtaining the bodies of St. George and St. Aurelius, except that, as the\r\nhead of the latter was lacking, that of St. Natalia was substituted.\r\nWith these precious spoils they returned in safety to Paris, by way of\r\nToledo, Alcalá, Saragossa and Barcelona, to the immense gratification,\r\nwe are told, of King Charles.[134] The persecution was but temporary\r\nand, a century later, in 956, we hear of Abderrhaman III sending\r\nRecemund, Bishop of Elvira (Granada), as his ambassador to Otho the\r\nGreat at Frankfort, where he persuaded Liutprand of Cremona to write one\r\nof his historical works.[135] When the Cid conquered Valencia, in 1096,\r\none of the conditions of surrender was that the garrison should be\r\ncomposed of Mozárabes, and the capitulation was signed by the principal\r\nChristian as well as Moslem citizens.[136]\r\n\r\nThe number of the Mozárabes of course diminished rapidly in the progress\r\nof reconquest as the Christian territories expanded from Galicia to Leon\r\nand Castile. Early in the twelfth century Alfonso VI, in reducing to\r\norder his extensive acquisitions, experienced much trouble with them;\r\nthey are described as being worse than Moors, and he settled the matter\r\nby the decisive expedient of deporting multitudes of them to\r\nAfrica.[137] The rapid progress of his arms, however, had so alarmed the\r\npetty kings among whom Andalusia was divided that they had, about 1090,\r\ninvited to their assistance the Berbers known as Almoravides, who drove\r\nback Alfonso on the bloody field of Zalaca. Their leader, Jusuf ibn\r\nTechufin, was not content to fight for the benefit of his allies; he\r\nspeedily overthrew their feeble dynasties and established himself as\r\nsupreme in Moslem Spain. The Almoravides were savage and fanatical; they\r\ncould not endure the sight of Christians enjoying freedom of worship,\r\nand bitter persecution speedily followed, until, in 1125, the Mozárabes\r\ninvited the aid of Alfonso el Batallador. They sent a roll of their best\r\nwarriors, comprising twelve thousand names, and promised that these and\r\nmany more would join him. He came and spent fifteen months on Moorish\r\nterritory, but made no permanent conquests, and on his departure the\r\nwretched Christians begged him to let them accompany him to escape the\r\nwrath of the Almoravides. Ten thousand of them did so, while of those\r\nwho remained large numbers were deported to Africa, where they mostly\r\nperished.[138] The miserable remnant had a breathing spell, for the\r\natmosphere of Spain seemed unpropitious to fanaticism and the ferocity\r\nof the Berbers speedily softened. We soon find them fraternizing with\r\nChristians. King Ali of Córdova treated the latter well and even\r\nentrusted to a captive noble of Barcelona named Reverter the command of\r\nhis armies. His son Techufin followed his example and was regarded as\r\nthe especial friend of the Christians, who aided him in his African\r\nwars.[139] Yet this interval of rest was short. In 1146, another Berber\r\nhorde, known as Almohades, overthrew the Almoravides and brought a fresh\r\naccession of savage ferocity from the African deserts. Their caliph,\r\nAbd-al-mumin, proclaimed that he would suffer none but true believers in\r\nhis dominions; the alternatives offered were death, conversion or\r\nexpatriation. Many underwent pretended conversion, others went into\r\nvoluntary exile, and others were deported to Africa, after which the\r\nMozárabes disappear from view.[140]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MULADÍES_]\r\n\r\nYet it was as impossible for the Almohades to retain their fanaticism as\r\nit had proved for their predecessors. When, in 1228, on the deposition\r\nof the Almohad Miramamolin Al-Abdel, his nephew Yahia was raised to the\r\nthrone, his brother Al-Memon-Abo-l-Ola, who was in Spain, claimed the\r\nsuccession. To obtain the assistance of San Fernando III, who lent him\r\ntwelve thousand Christian troops, he agreed to surrender ten frontier\r\nstrongholds, to permit the erection of a Christian church in Morocco,\r\nwhere the Christians should celebrate publicly with ringing of bells,\r\nand to allow freedom of conversion from Islam to Christianity, with\r\nprohibition of the converse. This led to the foundation of an episcopate\r\nof Morocco, of which the first bishop was Fray Aguelo, succeeded by Fray\r\nLope, both Franciscans.[141] Co-operation of this kind with the\r\nChristians meets us at every step in the annals of the Spanish Saracens.\r\nAben-al-Ahmar, who founded the last dynasty of Granada, agreed to become\r\na vassal of San Fernando III, to pay him a tribute of 150,000 doblas per\r\nannum, to furnish a certain number of troops whenever called upon, and\r\nto appear in the Córtes when summoned, like any other ricohome. He aided\r\nFernando greatly in the capture of Seville, and, in the solemnities\r\nwhich followed the entry into the city, Fernando bestowed knighthood on\r\nhim and granted him the bearing of the Castilian guidon--gules, a band\r\nor, with two serpents, and two crowned lions as supporters--a cognizance\r\nstill to be seen in the Alhambra.[142]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Muladíes_, or Christian converts to Islam, formed another important\r\nportion of the Moorish community. At the conquest, as we have seen,\r\nlarge numbers of Christians apostatized, slaves to obtain freedom and\r\nfreemen to escape taxation. They were looked upon, however, with\r\nsuspicion by Arabs and Berbers and were subjected to disabilities which\r\nled to frequent rebellions and murderous reprisals. On the suppression\r\nof a rising in Córdova, in 814, fifteen thousand of them emigrated to\r\nEgypt, where they captured Alexandria and held it until 826, when they\r\nwere forced to capitulate and transferred their arms to Candia, founding\r\na dynasty which lasted for a century and a half. Eight thousand of them\r\nestablished themselves in Fez, where they held their own and even in the\r\nfourteenth century were distinguishable from the other Moslems. In\r\nToledo, after several unsuccessful rebellions, the Muladíes became\r\ndominant in 853 and remained independent for eighty years. Together with\r\nthe Mozárabes they almost succeeded in founding a kingdom of their own\r\nin the mountains of Ronda, under Omar ben Hafsun, who embraced\r\nChristianity. Indeed, the facility of conversion from one faith to\r\nanother was a marked feature of the period and shows how little firmness\r\nof religious conviction existed. The renegade, Ibn Meruan, who founded\r\nan independent state in Merida, taught a mixed faith compounded of both\r\nthe great religions. Everywhere the Muladíes were striving for freedom\r\nand establishing petty principalities--in Algarbe, in Priego, in Murcia,\r\nand especially in Aragon, where the Gothic family of the Beni-Cassi\r\nbecame supreme. After the reduction of Toledo by starvation, in 930,\r\nthey become less prominent and gradually merge into the Moslem\r\npopulation.[143] This was assisted by the fact that they made common\r\ncause with their conquerors against the fanatic Almoravides and\r\nAlmohades. The leader of the Andalusians against the latter was a man of\r\nChristian descent, Ibn-Mardanich, King of Valencia and Murcia. He wore\r\nChristian dress and arms, his language was Castilian and his troops were\r\nmostly Castilians, Navarrese and Catalans. To the Christians he was\r\ncommonly known as the king Don Lope. Religious differences, in fact,\r\nwere of much less importance than political aims, and everywhere, as we\r\nshall see, Christian and Moslem were intermingled in the interminable\r\ncivil broils of that tumultuous time. In an attempt on Granada, in 1162,\r\nthe principal captains of Ibn-Mardanich were two sons of the Count of\r\nUrgel and a grandson of Alvar Fañez, the favorite lieutenant of the\r\nCid.[144]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE JEWS UNDER THE SARACENS_]\r\n\r\nIn these alternations of religious indifference and fanaticism, the\r\nposition of the Jews under Moslem domination was necessarily exposed to\r\nsevere vicissitudes. Their skill as physicians and their unrivalled\r\ntalent in administration rendered them a necessity to the conquerors,\r\nwhose favor they had gained by the assistance rendered in the invasion,\r\nbut ever and anon there would come a burst of intolerance which swept\r\nthem into obscurity if not into massacre. When Mahomet I ascended the\r\nthrone of Córdova, about 850, we are told that one of his first acts was\r\nthe dismissal of all Jewish officials, including presumably R. Hasdai\r\nben Ishak, who had been physician and vizier to his father, Abderrhaman\r\nII.[145] A century later their wealth was so great that when the Jew\r\nPeliag went to the country palace of Alhakem, the Caliph of Córdova, it\r\nis related that he was accompanied by a retinue of seven hundred\r\nretainers of his race, all richly clad and riding in carriages.[146] How\r\ninsecure was their prosperity was proved, in 1066, when Samuel ha Levi\r\nand his son Joseph had been viziers and virtual rulers of Granada for\r\nfifty years. The latter chanced to exile Abu Ishac of Elvira, a noted\r\ntheologian and poet, who took revenge in a bitter satire which had\r\nimmense popular success. \"The Jews reign in Granada; they have divided\r\nbetween them the city and the provinces, and everywhere one of this\r\naccursed race is in supreme power. They collect the taxes, they dress\r\nmagnificently and fare sumptuously, while the true believers are in rags\r\nand wretchedness. The chief of these asses is a fatted ram. Slay him and\r\nhis kindred and allies and seize their immense treasures. They have\r\nbroken the compact between us and are subject to punishment as\r\nperjurers.\" We shall see hereafter how ready was the Christian mob to\r\nrespond to such appeals; the Moslem was no better; a rising took place\r\nin which Joseph was assassinated in the royal palace, while four\r\nthousand Jews were massacred and their property pillaged.[147] Again\r\nthey recuperated themselves, but they suffered with the Christians under\r\nthe fierce fanaticism of the Almohades. Indeed, they were exposed to a\r\nfiercer outburst of wrath, for the robbery of the jewels of the Kaaba,\r\nwhich occurred about 1160, was attributed to Spanish Jews, and\r\nAbd-el-mumin was unsparing in enforcing his orders of conversion.\r\nNumbers were put to death and forty-eight synagogues were burnt. The\r\nSephardim, or Spanish Jews, lost their most conspicuous doctor when, in\r\nthis persecution, Maimonides fled to Egypt.[148] Still they continued to\r\nexist and to prosper, though exposed to destruction at any moment\r\nthrough the whims of the monarch or the passions of the people. Thus, in\r\n1375, in Granada, two men obstructed a street in a violent altercation\r\nand were vainly adjured to cease in the name of Mahomet, when Isaac\r\nAmoni, the royal physician, who chanced to pass in his carriage,\r\nrepeated the order and was obeyed. That a Jew should possess more\r\ninfluence than the name of the Prophet was unendurable; the people rose\r\nand a massacre ensued.[149]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SPANIARDS AND MOORS_]\r\n\r\nWhile Saracen Spain was thus a confused medley of races and faiths,\r\nsubject to no guiding principle and swayed by the policy or the\r\nprejudices of the moment, the Christian kingdoms were much the same,\r\nexcept that, during the early Middle Ages, outbursts of fanaticism were\r\nlacking. Brave warriors learned to respect each other, and, as usual, it\r\nwas the non-combatants, Christian priests and Moslem faquis, who\r\nretained their virulence. In the fierce struggles of the Reconquest\r\nthere is little trace of race or religious hatred. The early ballads\r\nshow the Moors regarded as gallant antagonists, against whom there was\r\nno greater animosity than was aroused in the civil strife which filled\r\nthe intervals of Moorish warfare.[150] When, in 1149, Ramon Berenger IV\r\nof Barcelona, after a laborious siege, captured the long-coveted town of\r\nLérida, the terms of surrender assumed the form of a peaceful agreement\r\nby which the Moorish Alcaide Avifelet became the vassal of Ramon\r\nBerenger and they mutually pledged each other fidelity. Avifelet gave up\r\nall his castles, retained certain rights in the territory and Ramon\r\nBerenger promised him fiefs in Barcelona and Gerona.[151] More than\r\nthis, the ceaseless civil wars on both sides of the boundary caused each\r\nto have constant recourse to those of hostile faith for aid or shelter,\r\nand the relations which grew up, although transitory and shifting,\r\nbecame so intricate that little difference between Christian and Moor\r\ncould often be recognized by statesmen. Thus mutual toleration could not\r\nfail to establish itself, to the scandal of crusaders, who came to help\r\nthe one side, and of the hordes of fresh fanatics who poured over from\r\nAfrica to assist the other.\r\n\r\nThis constant intermingling of Spaniard and Moor meets us at every step\r\nin Spanish history. Perhaps it would be too much to say, with Dozy, that\r\n\"a Spanish knight of the Middle Ages fought neither for his country nor\r\nfor his religion; he fought, like the Cid, to get something to eat,\r\nwhether under a Christian or a Mussulman prince\" and \"the Cid himself\r\nwas rather a Mussulman than a Catholic,\"[152] though Philip II\r\nendeavored to have him canonized--but there can be no question that\r\nreligious zeal had little to do with the Reconquest. In the adventurous\r\ncareer of the Cid, Christians and Moslems are seen mingled in both\r\ncontending armies, and it is for the most part impossible to detect in\r\nthe struggle any interest either of race or religion.[153] This had long\r\nbeen customary. Towards the end of the ninth century, Bermudo, brother\r\nof Alfonso III, for seven years held Astorga with the aid of the Moors,\r\nto whom he fled for refuge when finally dislodged. About 940 we find a\r\nKing Aboiahia, a vassal of Abderrhaman of Córdova, transferring\r\nallegiance to Ramiro II and then returning to his former lord, and some\r\nfifteen years later, when Sancho I was ejected by a conspiracy, he took\r\nrefuge with Abderrhaman, by whose aid he regained his kingdom, the\r\nusurper Ordoño, in turn flying to Córdova, where he was hospitably\r\nreceived.[154] About 990 Bermudo II gave his sister to wife to the\r\nMoorish King of Toledo, resulting in an unexpected miracle. In the\r\nterrible invasion of Almanzor, in 997, which threatened destruction to\r\nthe Christians, we are told that he was accompanied by numerous exiled\r\nChristian nobles. Alfonso VI of Castile, when overcome by his brother,\r\nSancho II, sought asylum, until the death of the latter, in Toledo--a\r\nhospitality which he subsequently repaid by conquering the city and\r\nkingdom.[155] His court was semi-oriental; during his exile he had\r\nbecome familiar with Arabic; in his prosperity he gathered around him\r\nSaracen poets and sages, and among his numerous successive wives was\r\nZaida, daughter of Al-Mutamid, King of Seville. His contemporary, Sancho\r\nI of Aragon, was equally given to Moslem culture and habitually signed\r\nhis name with Arabic characters.[156]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ALLIANCES WITH MOORS_]\r\n\r\nThe co-operation of Christian and Moor continued to the last. In 1270,\r\nwhen Alfonso X had rendered himself unpopular by releasing Portugal from\r\nvassalage to Leon, his brother, the Infante Felipe and a number of the\r\nmore powerful ricosomes conspired against him. Their first thought was\r\nto obtain an alliance with Abu Jusuf, King of Morocco, who gladly\r\npromised them assistance. The prelates of Castile fanned the flame,\r\nhoping in the confusion to gain enlarged privileges. Felipe and his\r\nconfederates renounced allegiance to Alfonso, in accordance with the\r\nfuero, and betook themselves to Granada, committing frightful\r\ndevastations by the way. Everything promised a disastrous war with the\r\nMoors of both sides of the straits, when, through the intervention of\r\nQueen Violante, concessions were made to the rebellious nobles and peace\r\nwas restored.[157] So when, in 1282, Sancho IV revolted against his\r\nfather and was supported by all the cities except Seville and by all the\r\nricosomes save the Master of Calatrava, and was recognized by the Kings\r\nof Granada, Portugal, Aragon and Navarre, Alfonso X in his destitution\r\nsent his crown to Abu Jusuf and asked for a loan on it as a pledge. The\r\nchivalrous Moslem at once sent him 60,000 doblas and followed this by\r\ncoming with a large force of horse and foot, whereupon Sancho entered\r\ninto alliance with Granada and a war ensued with Christians and Moors on\r\nboth sides, till the death of Alfonso settled the question of the\r\nsuccession.[158] In 1324, Don Juan Manuel was Adelantado de la Frontera;\r\nconceiving some cause of quarrel with his cousin, Alfonso XI, he at once\r\nentered into an alliance with Granada, then at war with Castile, and in\r\n1333 his turbulence rendered Alfonso unable to prevent the capture of\r\nGibraltar or to recover it when he made the attempt.[159] Pedro the\r\nCruel, in 1366 and again in 1368, had Moorish troops to aid him in his\r\nstruggles with Henry of Trastamara. In the latter year the King of\r\nGranada came to his aid with a force of 87,000 men, and, in the final\r\nbattle at Montiel, Pedro had 1500 Moorish horsemen in his army.[160] One\r\nof the complaints formulated against Henry IV, in 1464, was that he was\r\naccompanied by a force of Moors who committed outrages upon\r\nChristians.[161]\r\n\r\nIt was the same in Aragon. No knight of the cross earned a more\r\nbrilliant reputation for exploits against the infidel than Jaime I, who\r\nacquired by them his title of el _Conquistador_, yet when, in 1260, he\r\ngave his nobles permission to serve in a crusade under Alfonso X, he\r\nexcepted the King of Tunis, and on Alfonso's remonstrating with him he\r\nexplained that this was because of the love which the King of Tunis bore\r\nhim and of the truce existing between them and of the number of his\r\nsubjects who were in Tunis with much property, all of whom would be\r\nimperilled.[162] On the accession of Jaime II, in 1291, envoys came to\r\nhim from the Kings of Granada and Tremecen to renew the treaties had\r\nwith Alfonso III. To the latter Jaime replied, promising freedom of\r\ntrade, demanding the annual tribute of 2000 doblas which had been\r\ncustomary and asking for the next summer a hundred light horse paid for\r\nthree months, to aid him against his Christian enemies.[163] As late as\r\n1405, the treaty between Martin of Aragon and his son Martin of Sicily\r\non the one hand and Mahomet, King of Granada, on the other, not only\r\nguarantees free intercourse and safety to the subjects of each and open\r\ntrade in all ports and towns of their respective dominions, but each\r\nparty agrees, when called upon, to assist the other, except against\r\nallies--Aragon and Sicily with four or five galleys well armed and\r\nmanned and Granada with four or five hundred cavalry.[164]\r\n\r\nAll these alliances and treaties for freedom of trade and intercourse\r\nwere in direct antagonism to the decrees of the Church, which in its\r\ncouncils ordered priests every Sunday to denounce as excommunicate, or\r\neven liable to be reduced to slavery, all who should sell to Moors iron,\r\nweapons, timber, fittings for ships, bread, wine, animals to eat, ride\r\nor till the ground, or who should serve in their ships as pilots or in\r\ntheir armies in war upon Christians.[165] It was in vain that Gregory\r\nXI, in 1372, ordered all fautors and receivers of Saracens to be\r\nprosecuted as heretics by the Inquisition, and equally vain was the\r\ndeduction drawn by Eymerich from this, that any one who lent aid or\r\ncounsel or favor to the Moors was a fautor of heresy, to be punished as\r\nsuch by the Holy Office.[166] In spite of the thunders of the Church the\r\ntraders continued trading and the princes made offensive and defensive\r\nalliances with the infidel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MUDÉJARES_]\r\n\r\nNor, with the illustrious example of the Cid before them, had Christian\r\nnobles the slightest hesitation to aid the Moors by taking service with\r\nthem. When, in 1279, Alonso Pérez de Guzman, the founder of the great\r\nhouse of Medina Sidonia, was insulted in the court of Alfonso, he\r\npromptly renounced his allegiance, converted all his property into\r\nmoney, and raised a troop with which he entered the service of Abu Jusuf\r\nof Morocco. There he remained for eleven years, except a visit to\r\nSeville to marry Doña María Coronel, whom he carried back to Morocco. He\r\nwas made captain of all the Christian troops in Abu Jusuf's employ and\r\naided largely in the war which transferred the sovereignty of that\r\nportion of Africa from the Almohades to the Beni Marin. He accumulated\r\nimmense wealth, which by a stratagem he transferred to Spain, where it\r\npurchased the estates on which the greatness of the house was based. The\r\nfamily historiographer, writing in 1541, feels obliged to explain this\r\nreadiness to serve the infidel, so abhorrent to the convictions of the\r\nsixteenth century. He tells us that at that period the Moors, both of\r\nGranada and Africa, were unwarlike and were accustomed to rely upon\r\nChristian troops, and that princes, nobles and knights were constantly\r\nin their service. Henry, brother of Alfonso X, served the King of Tunis\r\nfour years and amassed large wealth; Garcí Martínez de Gallegos was\r\nalready in the service of Abu Jusuf when Guzman went there; Gonzalo de\r\nAguilar became a vassal of the King of Granada and fought for him. In\r\n1352, when Pedro the Cruel began to reduce his turbulent nobles to\r\norder, Don Juan de la Cerda, a prince of the blood, went to Morocco for\r\nassistance and, failing to obtain it, remained there and won great\r\nrenown by his knightly deeds till he was reconciled to Pedro and\r\nreturned to Castile. Examples might be multiplied, but these will\r\nsuffice to indicate how few scruples of religion existed among the\r\nSpaniards of the Middle Ages. As Barrantes says, adventurous spirits in\r\nthose days took service with the Moors as in his time they sought their\r\nfortunes in the Indies.[167]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is thus easy to understand how, in the progress of the Reconquest,\r\nthe Moors of the territory acquired were treated with even greater\r\nforbearance than the Christians had been when Spain was first overrun.\r\nWhen raids were made or cities were captured by force, there was no\r\nhesitation in putting the inhabitants to the sword or in carrying them\r\noff into slavery,[168] but when capitulations were made or provinces\r\nsubmitted, the people were allowed to remain, retaining their religion\r\nand property, and becoming known under name of _Mudéjares_.\r\n\r\nThe enslaved Moor was his master's property, like his cattle, but\r\nentitled to some safeguards of life and limb. Even baptism did not\r\nmanumit him unless the owner were a Moor or a Jew.[169] That he was\r\nfrequently a man of trained skill and education is seen in the provision\r\nthat, if his master confided to him a shop or a ship, the former was\r\nbound to fulfill all contracts entered into by his slave.[170] Thus the\r\nfree Castilian, whose business was war, had his trade and commerce to a\r\nconsiderable extent, as well as his agriculture, carried on by slaves,\r\nand the rest was mostly in the hands of the Jews and the free Moors or\r\nMudéjares. Labor thus became the badge of races regarded as inferior; it\r\nwas beneath the dignity of the freeman, and when, as we shall see\r\nhereafter, the industrious population was expelled by bigotry, the\r\nprosperity of Spain collapsed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MUDÉJARES_]\r\n\r\nAs for the Mudéjares, the practice of allowing them to remain in the\r\nreconquered territories began early. Even in Galicia they were to be\r\nfound, and in Leon documents of the tenth century contain many Moorish\r\nnames among those who confirm or witness them.[171] The Fuero of Leon,\r\ngranted by Alfonso V in 1020, alludes to Moors holding slaves, and the\r\nBerber population there is still represented by the Maragatos, to the\r\nsouth-west of Astorga--a race perfectly distinct from the Spaniards,\r\nretaining much of their African costume and speaking Castilian\r\nimperfectly, although it is their only language.[172] Fernando I\r\n(1033-65), who rendered the Kings of Toledo and Seville tributary, and\r\nwho was besieging Valencia when he died, alternated in his policy\r\ntowards the inhabitants of his extensive conquests. In the early part of\r\nhis reign he allowed them to remain; then he adopted depopulation, and\r\nfinally he returned to his earlier methods.[173] Alfonso VI followed the\r\nmore liberal system; when he occupied Toledo, in 1085, he granted a\r\ncapitulation to the inhabitants which secured to them their property and\r\nreligion, with self-government and the possession of their great\r\nmosque.[174] When, during his absence, the Frenchman, Bernard Abbot of\r\nSahagun, newly elected to the archbishopric, in concert with his queen,\r\nConstance of Burgundy, suddenly entered the mosque, consecrated it and\r\nplaced a bell on its highest minaret, Alfonso was greatly angered. He\r\nhastened to Toledo, threatening to burn both the queen and the\r\narchbishop, and only pardoned them at the intercession of the Moors, who\r\ndreaded possible reprisals after his death. His policy, in fact, was to\r\nrender his rule more attractive to the Moslem population than that of\r\nhis tributaries, the petty _reyes de taifas_, who were obliged to\r\noppress their subjects in order to satisfy his exigencies. He even\r\nstyled himself _Emperador de los dos cultos_. His tolerant wisdom\r\njustified itself, for, after the coming of the Almoravides, in spite of\r\nthe disastrous defeats of Zalaca and Uclés, he was able to hold his own\r\nand even to extend his boundaries, for the native Moors preferred his\r\ndomination to that of the savage Berbers.[175]\r\n\r\nHis successors followed his example, but it was not regarded with favor\r\nby the Church. During the centuries of mental torpor which preceded the\r\ndawn of modern civilization there was little fanaticism. With the\r\nopening of the twelfth century various causes awoke the dormant spirit.\r\nCrusading enthusiasm brought increased religious ardor and the labors of\r\nthe schoolmen commenced the reconstruction of theology which was to\r\nrender the Church dominant over both worlds. The intellectual and\r\nspiritual movement brought forth heresies which, by the commencement of\r\nthe thirteenth century, aroused the Church to the necessity of summoning\r\nall its resources to preserve its supremacy. All this made itself felt,\r\nnot only in Albigensian crusades and the establishment of the\r\nInquisition, but in increased intolerance to Jew and Saracen, in a more\r\nfiery antagonism to all who were not included in the pale of\r\nChristianity. How this worked was seen, in 1212, when, after the\r\nbrilliant victory of Las Navas de Tolosa, Alfonso IX advanced to Ubeda,\r\nwhere 70,000 men had collected, and they offered to become Mudéjares and\r\nto pay him a million of doblas. The terms were acceptable and he agreed\r\nto them, but the clerical chiefs of the crusade, the two archbishops,\r\nRodrigo of Toledo and Arnaud of Narbonne, objected and forced him to\r\nwithdraw his assent. He offered the besieged to let them depart on the\r\npayment of the sum, but they were unable to collect so large an amount\r\non the spot, and they were put to the sword, except those reserved as\r\nslaves.[176] In the same spirit Innocent IV, in 1248, ordered Jaime I of\r\nAragon to allow no Saracens to reside in his recently conquered Balearic\r\nIsles except as slaves.[177]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MUDÉJARES_]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the opposition of the Church the policy of the _mudéjalato_\r\nwas continued until the work of the Reconquest seemed on the point of\r\ncompletion under San Fernando III. The King of Granada was his vassal,\r\nlike any other Castilian noble. He subdued the rest of the land, giving\r\nthe local chiefs advantageous terms and allowing them to assume the\r\ntitle of kings. The Spanish Moors were thus reduced to submission and he\r\nwas preparing to carry his arms into Africa at the time of his death, in\r\n1252.[178] That Moorish rule, more or less independent, continued in the\r\nPeninsula for yet two centuries and a half, is attributable solely to\r\nthe inveterate turbulence of the Castilian magnates aided by the\r\ndisorderly ambition of members of the royal family. During this interval\r\nsuccessive fragments were added to Christian territory, when internal\r\nconvulsions allowed opportunities of conquest, and in these the system\r\nwhich had proved so advantageous was followed. Moor and Jew were\r\ncitizens of the realm, regarded as a desirable class of the population,\r\nand entitled to the public peace and security for their property under\r\nthe same sanctions as the Catholic.[179] They are enumerated with\r\nChristians in charters granting special exemptions and privileges to\r\ncities, safeguards for fairs and for general trade.[180] Numerous Fueros\r\nwhich have reached us place all races on the same level, and a charter\r\nof Alfonso X, in 1272, to the city of Murcia, in its regulations as to\r\nthe cleansing of irrigating canals, shows that even in petty details\r\nsuch as these there was no distinction recognized between Christian and\r\nMoor.[181] The safeguards thrown around them are seen in the charter of\r\n1101, granted to the Mozárabes of Toledo by Alfonso VI, permitting them\r\nthe use of their ancestral Fuero Juzgo, but penalties under it are only\r\nto be one-fifth, as in the Fuero of Castile \"except in cases of theft\r\nand of the murder of Jews and Moors,\" and in the Fuero of Calatayud,\r\ngranted by Alfonso el Batallador, in 1131, the _wergild_ for a Jew or a\r\nMoor is 300 sueldos, the same as for a Christian.[182] Yet the practice\r\nas to this was not strictly uniform, and the conquering race naturally\r\nsought to establish distinctions which should recognize its superiority.\r\nThe Fuero of Madrid, in 1202, imposes various disabilities on the\r\nMoors.[183] A law of Alfonso X, who throughout his reign showed himself\r\nfavorable to the subject races, emphatically says that, if a Jew strikes\r\na Christian, he is not to be punished according to the privileges of the\r\nJews, but as much more severely as a Christian is better than a Jew; so\r\nif a Christian slays a Jew or a Moor he is to be punished according to\r\nthe Fuero of the place, and if there is no provision for the case, then\r\nhe is to suffer death or banishment or other penalty as the king may see\r\nfit, but the Moor who slays a Christian is to suffer more severely than\r\na Christian who slays a Moor or a Jew.[184]\r\n\r\nIn an age of class distinctions this was an inevitable tendency and it\r\nis creditable to Spanish tolerance and humanity that its progress was so\r\nslow. In the violence of the time there was doubtless much arbitrary\r\noppression, but the Mudéjares knew their rights and had no hesitation in\r\nasserting them, nor does there seem to have been a disposition to deny\r\nthem. Thus, in 1387, those of Bustiella complained to Juan I that the\r\nroyal tax-collectors were endeavoring to collect from them the Moorish\r\ncapitation tax, to which they were not subject, having in lieu thereof\r\nfrom ancient times paid to the Lords of Biscay twelve hundred maravedís\r\nper annum and being entitled to enjoy all the franchises and liberties\r\nof Biscay, whereupon the king issued an order to the assessors to demand\r\nfrom them only the agreed sum and no other taxes, and to guarantee to\r\nthem all the franchises and liberties, uses and customs of the Lordship\r\nof Biscay.[185] Even more suggestive is a celebrated case occurring as\r\nlate as the reign of Henry IV. In 1455 the chaplains of the Capella de\r\nla Cruz of Toledo complained to the king that the tax on all meat\r\nslaughtered in the town had been assigned to the chapel for its\r\nmaintenance, but that the Moors had established their own\r\nslaughter-house and refused to pay the tax. Elsewhere than in Spain the\r\nmatter would have been referred to an ecclesiastical court with a\r\nconsequent decision in favor of the faith, but here it went to the civil\r\ncourt with the result that, after elaborate argument on both sides, in\r\n1462 the great jurist Alfonso Díaz de Montalvan rendered a decision\r\nrecognizing that the Moors could not eat meat slaughtered in the\r\nChristian fashion, that they were entitled to a slaughter-house of their\r\nown, free of tax, but that they must not sell meat to Christians and\r\nmust pay the tax on all that they might thus have sold.[186] Trivial as\r\nis this case, it gives us a clear insight into the independence and\r\nself-assertion of the Moorish communities and the readiness of the\r\ncourts to protect them in their rights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EFFORTS AT CONVERSION_]\r\n\r\nThe Mudéjares were guaranteed the enjoyment of their own religion and\r\nlaws. They had their mosques and schools and, in the earlier times,\r\nmagistrates of their own race who decided all questions between\r\nthemselves according to their own _zunna_ or law, but suits between\r\nChristian and Moor were sometimes heard by a Christian judge and\r\nsometimes by a mixed bench of both faiths.[187] In the capitulations it\r\nwas generally provided that they should be subject only to the taxes\r\nexacted by their previous sovereigns, though in time this was apt to be\r\ndisregarded.[188] A privilege granted, in 1254, by Alfonso X to the\r\ninhabitants of Seville, authorizing them to purchase land of Moors\r\nthroughout their district, shows that the paternal possessions of the\r\nlatter had been undisturbed; they were free to buy and sell real estate,\r\nand although, when the reactionary period commenced, toward the close of\r\nthe thirteenth century, Sancho IV granted the petition of the Córtes of\r\nValladolid in 1293, forbidding Jews and Moors to purchase land of\r\nChristians, the restriction soon became obsolete.[189] Not only was\r\nthere no prohibition of their bearing arms, but they were liable to\r\nmilitary service. Exemption from this was a special privilege accorded,\r\nin 1115, at the capitulation of Tudela; in 1263 Jaime I of Aragon\r\nreleased the Moors of Masones from tribute and military service in\r\nconsideration of an annual payment of 1500 _sueldos jaquenses_; in 1283\r\nhis son Pedro III, when preparing to resist the invasion of Philippe le\r\nHardi, summoned his faithful Moors of Valencia to join his armies and,\r\nin the levies made in Murcia in 1385 for the war with Portugal, each\r\naljama had its assigned quota.[190]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DENATIONALIZATION OF THE MUDÉJARES_]\r\n\r\nA wise policy would have dictated the mingling of the races as much as\r\npossible, so as to encourage unification and facilitate the efforts at\r\nconversion which were never lost to sight. The _converso_ or baptized\r\nMoor or Jew was the special favorite of the legislator. The Moorish law\r\nwhich disinherited an apostate was set aside and he was assured of his\r\nshare in the paternal estate; the popular tendency to stigmatize him as\r\na _tornadizo_ or _renegat_ was severely repressed. The Church insisted\r\nthat a Moorish captive who sincerely sought baptism should be set free.\r\nDominicans and Franciscans were empowered to enter all places where Jews\r\nand Moors dwelt, to assemble them to listen to sermons, while the royal\r\nofficials were directed to compel the attendance of those who would not\r\ncome voluntarily.[191] It is easy now to see that this policy, which\r\nresulted in winning over multitudes to the faith, would have been vastly\r\nmore fruitful if the races had been compelled to associate together, and\r\ninfinite subsequent misery and misfortune would have been averted, but\r\nthis was a stretch of tolerant humanity virtually impossible at the\r\ntime. The Church, as will be seen, exerted every effort to keep them\r\napart, on the humiliating pretext that she would lose more souls than\r\nshe would gain, and there was, moreover, sufficient mutual distrust to\r\nrender separation desired on both sides. At a very early period of the\r\nReconquest the policy was adopted of assigning a special quarter of a\r\ncaptured town to the Moors, and thus the habit was established of\r\nproviding a Morería in the larger cities, to which the Mudéjares were\r\nconfined. The process is well illustrated by what occurred at Murcia,\r\nwhen, in 1266, it was definitely reconquered for Alfonso X by Jaime I of\r\nAragon. He gave half the houses to Aragonese and Catalans and restricted\r\nthe Moors to the quarter of the Arrijaca. Alfonso confirmed the\r\narrangement, dislodging the Christians from among the Moors and building\r\na wall between them. His decree on the subject recites that this was\r\ndone at the prayer of the Moors, who were despoiled and ill-treated by\r\nthe Christians, and who desired the protection of a wall, to the\r\nconstruction of which he devoted one-half of the revenues levied for the\r\nrepair of the city walls. It was the same with the Jews, who were not to\r\ndwell among the Christians, but to have their Judería set apart for them\r\nnear the Orihuela gate.[192] Besides this segregation from the\r\nChristians in the cities there were smaller towns in which the\r\npopulation was purely Moorish, where Christians were not allowed to\r\ndwell. That this was regarded as a privilege we can readily imagine, and\r\nit is shown by the confirmation, in 1255, by Alfonso X of an agreement\r\nwith the Mudéjares of Moron under which they are to sell their\r\nproperties to Christians and remove to Silebar, where they are to build\r\na castle and houses, to be free of all taxes for three years, their law\r\nis to be administered by their own alcadí and no Christian is to reside\r\nthere except the _almojarife_, or tax-gatherer, and his men.[193] All\r\nthis tended to perpetuate the separation between the Christian and the\r\nMoor, and a further potent cause is to be found in the horror with which\r\nmiscegenation was regarded--at least when the male offender was a Moor.\r\nIntermarriage, of course, was impossible between those of different\r\nfaiths and illicit connections were punished in the most savage\r\nmanner.[194]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this natural but impolitic segregation, the Mudéjares\r\ngradually became denationalized and assimilated themselves in many ways\r\nto the population by which they were surrounded. In time they forgot\r\ntheir native language and it became necessary for their learned men to\r\ncompile law-books in Castilian for the guidance of their alcadís. Quite\r\na literature of this kind arose and, even after the final expulsion, as\r\nlate as the middle of the seventeenth century, among the refugees in\r\nTunis, a manual of religious observances was composed in Spanish, the\r\nauthor of which lamented that even the sacred characters in which the\r\nKorán was written were almost unknown and that the rites of worship were\r\nforgotten or mingled with usages and customs borrowed from the\r\nChristians.[195] The Mudéjares even sympathized with the patriotic\r\naspirations of their Castilian neighbors, as against their independent\r\nbrethren. When, in 1340, Alfonso XI returned in triumph to Seville,\r\nafter the overwhelming victory of the Rio Salado, we are told how the\r\nMoors and their women united with the Jews in the rejoicings which\r\ngreeted the conqueror.[196] Even more practical was the response to the\r\nappeal of the Infante Fernando, in 1410, when he was besieging\r\nAntequera, one of the bulwarks of Granada, and was in great straits for\r\nmoney. He wrote \"muy afectuosamente\" to Seville and Córdova, not only to\r\nthe Christians but to the Moorish and Jewish aljamas and, as he was\r\npopular with them, they advanced him what sums they could.[197] The\r\nprocess of denationalization and fusion with the Christian community was\r\nnecessarily slow, but its progress gave gratifying promise of a result,\r\nrequiring only wise patience and sympathy, which would have averted\r\nincalculable misfortunes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MUDÉJARES]\r\n\r\nIn a financial and industrial point of view the Mudéjares formed a most\r\nvaluable portion of the population. The revenues derived from them were\r\namong the most reliable resources of the State; assignments on them were\r\nfrequently used as the safest and most convenient form of securing\r\nappanages and dowries and incomes for prelates and religious\r\nestablishments.[198] To the nobles on whose lands they were settled they\r\nwere almost indispensable, for they were skilful agriculturists and the\r\nresults of their indefatigable labors brought returns which could be\r\nrealized in no other way. That they should be relentlessly exploited was\r\na matter of course. A fuero granted, in 1371, by the Almirante Ambrosio\r\nde Bocanegra to his Mudéjares of Palma del Rio, not only specifies their\r\ndues and taxes, but prescribes that they shall bake in the seignorial\r\noven and bathe in the seignorial bath and purchase their necessaries in\r\nthe seignorial shops.[199] They were not only admirable husbandmen and\r\nartificers, but distinguished themselves in the higher regions of\r\nscience and art. As physicians they ranked with the Jews, and when, in\r\n1345, Ferrant Rodríguez, Prior of the Order of Santiago, built the\r\nChurch of Our Lady of Uclés, he assembled \"Moorish masters\" and good\r\nChristian stone-masons, who constructed it of stone and mortar.[200] The\r\nindustry of Spain was to a great extent in their hands. To them the land\r\nowed the introduction of the sugar-cane, cotton, silk, the fig, the\r\norange and the almond. Their system of irrigation, still maintained to\r\nthe present time, was elaborately perfect, and they had built highways\r\nand canals to facilitate intercourse and transportation. Valencia, which\r\nwas densely populated by Mudéjares, was regarded as one of the richest\r\nprovinces in Europe, producing largely of sugar, oil and wine. In\r\nmanufacturing skill they were no less distinguished. Their fabrics of\r\nsilk and cotton and linen and wool were exquisite; their potteries and\r\nporcelains were models for the workmen of the rest of Europe; their\r\nleather-work was unsurpassed; their manufactures of metals were eagerly\r\nsought in distant lands, while their architecture manifests their\r\ndelicate skill and artistic taste. Marriages were arranged for girls at\r\n11 and boys at 12; dowries were of little account, for a bed and a few\r\ncoins were deemed sufficient where all were industrious and\r\nself-supporting, and their rapid increase, like evil weeds, was a\r\nsubject of complaint to their Castilian detractors. Ingenious and\r\nlaborious, sober and thrifty, a dense population found livelihood in\r\ninnumerable trades, in which men, women and children all labored,\r\nproducing wealth for themselves and prosperity for the land. In commerce\r\nthey were equally successful; they were slaves to their word, their\r\nreputation for probity and honor was universal, and their standing as\r\nmerchants was proverbial. There was no beggary among them and quarrels\r\nwere rare, differences being for the most part amicably settled without\r\nrecourse to their judges.[201]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to set limits to the prosperity attainable by the\r\nPeninsula with its natural resources developed by a population combining\r\nthe vigor of the Castilian with the industrial capacity of the Moor. All\r\nthat was needed was Christian patience and good will to kindle and\r\nencourage kindly feeling between the conquering and the subject race;\r\ntime would have done the rest. The infidel, won over to Christianity,\r\nwould have become fused with the faithful, and a united people, blessed\r\nwith the characteristics of both races, would have been ready to take\r\nthe foremost place in the wonderful era of industrial civilization which\r\nwas about to open. Unhappily for Spain this was not to be. To the\r\nconscientious churchman of the Middle Ages any compact with the infidel\r\nwas a league with Satan; he could not be forcibly brought into the fold,\r\nbut it was the plainest of duties to render his position outside so\r\ninsupportable that he would take refuge in conversion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DISTINCTIVE BADGES]\r\n\r\nThe Church accordingly viewed with repugnance the policy of conciliation\r\nand toleration which had so greatly facilitated the work of the\r\nReconquest, and it lost no opportunity of exciting popular distrust and\r\ncontempt for the Mudéjares. We shall see how great was its success with\r\nrespect to the Jews, whose position offered better opportunity for\r\nattack, but it was not without results as respects the Moors. It\r\ndiscouraged all intercourse between the races and endeavored to keep\r\nthem separate. Even the indispensable freedom of ordinary commercial\r\ndealings, which was provided for by the secular rulers, was frowned\r\nupon, and in 1250 the Order of Santiago was obliged to represent to\r\nInnocent IV that it had Moorish vassals, and to supplicate him for\r\nlicense to buy and sell with them, which he graciously permitted.[202]\r\nThe most efficacious means, however, of establishing and perpetuating\r\nthe distinction between the races was that Jews and Moors should wear\r\nsome peculiar garment or badge by which they should be recognized at\r\nsight. This was not only a mark of inferiority and a stigma, but it\r\nexposed the wearer to insults and outrages, rendering it both\r\nhumiliating and dangerous, especially to those, such as muleteers or\r\nmerchants, whose avocations rendered travel on the unsafe highways\r\nindispensable. When the Church was aroused from its torpor to combat\r\ninfidelity in all its forms, this was one of the measures adopted by the\r\ngreat council of Lateran in 1216, in a regulation carried into the canon\r\nlaw, the reason alleged being that it was necessary to prevent\r\nmiscegenation.[203] In 1217 Honorius III peremptorily ordered the\r\nenforcement of this decree in Castile, but, two years later, consented\r\nto suspend it, on the remonstrance of San Fernando III, backed by\r\nRodrigo, Archbishop of Toledo. The king represented that many Jews would\r\nabandon his kingdom rather than wear badges, while the rest would be\r\ndriven to plots and conspiracies, and, as the greater part of his\r\nrevenues was derived from them, he would be unable to carry out his\r\nenterprises against the Saracens.[204] It was difficult to arouse\r\nintolerance and race hatred in Spain, and, when Gregory IX, about 1233,\r\nand Innocent IV, in 1250, ordered the Castilian prelates to enforce the\r\nLateran canons, San Fernando quietly disregarded the injunction.[205]\r\nHis son, Alfonso X, so far yielded obedience that, in the Partidas, he\r\nordered, under a penalty of ten gold maravedís or ten lashes, all Jews,\r\nmale and female, to wear a badge on the cap, alleging the same reason as\r\nthe Lateran council, but he did not extend this to the Moors and, as his\r\ncode was not confirmed by the Córtes for nearly a century, the\r\nregulation may be regarded as inoperative.[206] The council of Zamora,\r\nwhich did so much to stimulate intolerance, in January, 1313, ordered\r\nthe badge to be worn, as it was in other lands, and later in the year\r\nthe Córtes of Plasencia proposed to obey, but were told by the Infante\r\nJuan, who presided as guardian of Alfonso XI, that he would, after\r\nconsultation, do what was for the advantage of the land.[207] In Aragon,\r\nthe councils of Tarragona, in 1238 and 1282, vainly ordered the canon to\r\nbe obeyed, and it was not until 1300 that the attempt was made with an\r\nordinance requiring the Mudéjares to wear the hair cut in a peculiar\r\nfashion that should be distinctive.[208] In Castile, at length, Henry\r\nII, in pursuance of the request of the Córtes of Toro in 1371, ordered\r\nall Jews and Moors to wear the badge (a red circle on the left\r\nshoulder), but the injunction had to be frequently repeated and was\r\nslenderly obeyed. Even so, to it may be attributed the frequent murders\r\nwhich followed of Jews on the highways, the perpetrators of which were\r\nrarely identified.[209]\r\n\r\nWhat was the spirit which the Church thus persistently endeavored to\r\narouse in Spain may be gathered from a brief of Clement IV, in 1266, to\r\nJaime I of Aragon, urging him to expel all Mudéjares from his dominions.\r\nHe assures the king that his reputation will suffer greatly if, for\r\ntemporal advantage, he longer permits such opprobrium of God, such an\r\ninfection of Christendom, as proceeds indubitably from the horrible\r\ncohabitation of the Moors, with its detestable horrors and horrid\r\nfoulness. By expelling them he will fulfil his vow to God, stop the\r\nmouths of his detractors and prove himself zealous for the faith.[210]\r\nThe same temper was shown, in 1278, by Nicholas III, when he scolded\r\nAlfonso X for entering into truces with the Moors, and, by threatening\r\nto deprive him of the share granted to him of the church revenues,\r\nincited him to the disastrous siege of Algeciras, the failure of which\r\nled him to form an alliance with the King of Morocco.[211] Fortunately\r\nthis papal zeal for the faith found no Ximenes in Spain to spread it\r\namong the people and to kindle the fires of intolerance. The Spanish\r\nChurch of the period appears to have been wholly quiescent. The only\r\naction on record is the trivial one of Arnaldo de Peralta, Bishop of\r\nValencia, from 1261 to 1273, who forbade, under pain of excommunication,\r\nhis clergy from drinking wine in the house of a Jew, provided they\r\nshould have heard of or should remember the prohibition; and he further\r\nvaguely threatened with his displeasure any cleric who should knowingly\r\nbuy the wine of a Jew, except in case of necessity.[212]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INFLUENCE OF THE CHURCH_]\r\n\r\nThat, in the Confusion which followed the rebellion of Sancho IV against\r\nhis father, there may have arisen a desire to limit somewhat the\r\nprivileges of Jew and Moor is rendered probable by the legislation of\r\nthe Córtes of Valladolid, in 1293, to which allusion has already been\r\nmade (p. 63), but the decisive impulse which aroused the Spanish Church\r\nfrom its indolent indifference and set it earnestly to work in exciting\r\npopular hatred and intolerance, would seem traceable to the council of\r\nVienne in 1311-12. Among the published canons of the council, the only\r\none relating to Moors is a complaint that those dwelling in Christian\r\nlands have their priests, called Zabazala, who, from the minarets of\r\ntheir mosques, at certain hours invoke Mahomet and sound his praises in\r\na loud voice, and also that they are accustomed to gather around the\r\ngrave of one whom they worship as a saint. These practices are denounced\r\nas unendurable, and the princes are ordered to suppress them, with the\r\nalternative of gaining salvation or of enduring punishment which shall\r\nmake them serve as a terrifying example.[213] This threat fell upon deaf\r\nears. In 1329 the council of Tarragona complains of its inobservance and\r\norders all temporal lords to enforce it within two months, under pain of\r\ninterdict and excommunication,[214] and a hundred years later the\r\ncouncil of Tortosa, in 1429, supplicated the King of Aragon and all\r\nprelates and nobles, by the bowels of divine mercy, to enforce the canon\r\nand all other conciliar decrees for the exaltation of the faith and the\r\nhumiliation of Jews and Moors, and to cause their observance by their\r\nsubjects if they wish to escape the vengeance of God and of the Holy\r\nSee. This was equally ineffectual, and it was reserved for Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, about 1482, to enforce the canon of Vienne with a vigor which\r\nbrought a remonstrance from the Grand Turk.[215]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INFLUENCE OF THE CHURCH_]\r\n\r\nMore serious was the effect upon the Jews of the spirit awakened at\r\nVienne. That council, besides enacting very severe laws against usury,\r\ndenounced the privilege accorded in Spain to Jews, whereby Jewish\r\nwitnesses were requisite for the conviction of Jewish defendants. It did\r\nnot presume to annul this privilege, but forbade all intercourse\r\nbetween the races wherever it was in force.[216] The Spanish prelates,\r\nin returning from the council in 1312, brought with them these canons\r\nand the spirit of intolerance that dictated them and made haste to give\r\nexpression to it at the council of Zamora, in January, 1313, in a number\r\nof canons, the temper of which is so different from the previous\r\nutterances of the Spanish Church that it shows the revolution wrought in\r\ntheir mode of thinking by intercourse with their brethren from other\r\nlands. Henceforth, in this respect, the Spanish Church emerges from its\r\nisolation and distinguishes itself by even greater ferocity than that\r\nwhich disgraced the rest of Christendom. The fathers of Zamora invoked\r\nthe curse of God and of St. Peter on all who should endeavor to enforce\r\nthe existing laws requiring the evidence of Jews to convict Jews. They\r\ndenounced the Jews as serpents, who were only to be endured by\r\nChristians because they were human beings, but were to be kept in strict\r\nsubjection and servitude, and they sought to reduce this principle to\r\npractice by a series of canons restricting the Jews in every way and\r\nputting an end to all social intercourse between them and\r\nChristians.[217] The friendly mingling of the races, which shows how\r\nlittle the prejudices of the churchmen were shared by the people at this\r\nperiod, became a favorite subject of objurgation and required a long\r\nseries of efforts to eradicate, but the Church triumphed at last, and\r\nthe seeds of envy, hatred and all uncharitableness, which it so\r\nassiduously planted and cultivated, yielded in the end an abundant\r\nharvest of evil. What prepossessions of Christian kindness the prelates\r\nof Zamora felt that they had to overcome are indicated in the final\r\ncommand that these constitutions should be read publicly in all\r\nchurches annually, and that the bishops should compel by excommunication\r\nall secular magistrates to enforce them.[218]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Church, thus fairly started in this deplorable direction,\r\npursued its course with characteristic energy. In 1322 the utterances of\r\nthe council of Valladolid reveal how intimate were the customary\r\nrelations between Christian and infidel, and how the Church, in place of\r\ntaking advantage of this, labored to keep the races asunder. The council\r\nrecites that scandals arise and churches are profaned by the prevailing\r\ncustom of Moors and Jews attending divine service, wherefore they are to\r\nbe expelled before the ceremonies of the mass begin, and all who\r\nendeavor to prevent it are to be excommunicated. The habit of nocturnal\r\ndevotional vigils in churches is also said, probably with truth, to be\r\nthe source of much evil, and all who bring Moors and Jews to take part\r\nwith their voices and instruments are to be expelled. To preserve the\r\nfaithful from pollution by Moorish and Jewish superstitions, they are\r\ncommanded no more to frequent the weddings and funerals of the infidels.\r\nThe absurd and irrational abuse whereby Jews and Moors are placed in\r\noffice over Christians is to be extirpated, and all prelates shall\r\npunish it with excommunication. As the malice of Moors and Jews leads\r\nthem craftily to put Christians to death, under pretext of curing them\r\nby medicine and surgery and, as the canons forbid Christians from\r\nemploying them as physicians, and as these canons are not observed in\r\nconsequence of the negligence of the prelates, the latter are ordered to\r\nenforce them strictly with the free use of excommunication.[219]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INFLUENCE OF THE CHURCH_]\r\n\r\nThese last two clauses point to matters which had long been special\r\ngrievances of the faithful and which demand a moment's attention. The\r\nsuperior administrative abilities of the Jews caused them to be\r\nconstantly sought for executive positions, to the scandal of all good\r\nChristians. We have seen that under the Goths it was an abuse calling\r\nfor constant animadversion. It was one of the leading complaints of\r\nInnocent III against Raymond VI of Toulouse, which he expiated so\r\ncruelly in the Albigensian crusades, and one of the decrees of the\r\nLateran council was directed against its continuance.[220] In Spain the\r\nsovereigns could not do without them, and we shall have occasion to see\r\nthat it became one of the main causes of popular dislike of the\r\nunfortunate race, for the Christian found it hard to bear with\r\nequanimity the domination of the Jew, especially in his ordinary\r\ncharacter of _almojarife_, or tax-collector. As early as 1118, Alfonso\r\nVIII, in the fuero granted to Toledo, promised that no Jew or recent\r\nconvert should be placed over the Christians; Alfonso X made the same\r\nconcession in the fuero of Alicante, in 1252, except that he reserved\r\nthe office of almojarife, and in the Partidas he endeavored to make the\r\nrule general.[221] The same necessity made itself felt with regard to\r\nthe function of the physician, for which, during the dark ages, the\r\nlearning of Jew and Saracen rendered them almost exclusively fitted.\r\nZedechias, the Jewish physician of the Emperor Charles the Bald, was\r\nrenowned, and tradition handed down his name as that of a skilful\r\nmagician.[222] Prince and prelate alike sought comfort in their curative\r\nministrations, and, as the Church looked askance on the practice of\r\nmedicine and surgery by ecclesiastics, unless it were through prayer and\r\nexorcism, they had the field almost to themselves. This had always been\r\nregarded with disfavor by the Church. As early as 706 the council of\r\nConstantinople had ordered the faithful not to take medicine from a Jew,\r\nand this command had been incorporated in the canon law.[223] Another\r\nrule, adopted from the Lateran council of 1216, was that the first duty\r\nof a physician was to care for the soul of the patient rather than for\r\nhis body, and to see that he was provided with a confessor--a duty which\r\nthe infidel could scarce be expected to recognize.[224] It is therefore\r\neasy to understand why the general abhorrence of the Church for Moor and\r\nJew should be sharpened with peculiar acerbity in regard to their\r\nfunctions as physicians; why the council of Valladolid should endeavor\r\nto alarm the people with the assertion that they utilized the position\r\nto slay the faithful, and the council of Salamanca, in 1335, should\r\nrenew the sentence of excommunication on all who should employ them in\r\nsickness.[225] Nominally the Church carried its point, and in the\r\nprescriptive laws of 1412 there was embodied a provision imposing a fine\r\nof three hundred maravedís on any Moor or Jew who should visit a\r\nChristian in sickness or administer medicine to him,[226] but the\r\nprohibition was impossible of enforcement. About 1462, the Franciscan,\r\nAlonso de Espina, bitterly complains that there is not a noble or a\r\nprelate but keeps a Jewish devil as a physician, although the zeal of\r\nthe Jews in studying medicine is simply to obtain an opportunity of\r\nexercising their malignity upon Christians; for one whom they cure they\r\nslay fifty, and when they are gathered together they boast as to which\r\nhas caused the most deaths, for their law commands them to spoil and\r\nslay the faithful.[227] It was but a few years after this that Abiatar\r\nAben Crescas, chief physician of Juan II of Aragon, the father of\r\nFerdinand, vindicated Jewish science by successfully relieving his royal\r\npatient of a double cataract and restoring his sight. On September 11,\r\n1469, pronouncing the aspect of the stars to be favorable, he operated\r\non the right eye; the king, delighted with his recovered vision, ordered\r\nhim to proceed with the left, but Abiatar refused, alleging that the\r\nstars had become unfavorable, and it was not until October 12 that he\r\nconsented to complete the cure.[228] The friars themselves believed as\r\nlittle as royalty in the stories which they invented to frighten the\r\npeople and create abhorrence of Jewish physicians. In spite of the fact\r\nthat Ferdinand and Isabella, in the _Ordenanzas_ of 1480, repeated the\r\nprohibition of their attending Christians, the Dominicans, in 1489,\r\nobtained from Innocent IV permission to employ them, notwithstanding all\r\necclesiastical censures, the reason alleged being that in Spain there\r\nwere few others.[229]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION_]\r\n\r\nThe prescriptive spirit which dominated the councils of Zamora and\r\nValladolid was not allowed to die out. That of Tarragona, in 1329,\r\nexpressed its horror at the friendly companionship with which Christians\r\nwere in the habit of attending the marriages, funerals and circumcisions\r\nof Jews and Moors and even of entering into the bonds of compaternity\r\nwith the parents at the latter ceremony, all of which it strictly\r\nforbade for the future.[230] A few years later, in 1337, Arnaldo,\r\nArchbishop of Tarragona, addressed to Benedict XII a letter which is a\r\nsignificant expression of the objects and methods of the Church. In\r\nspite, he says, of the vow taken by Jaime I when about to conquer\r\nValencia, that he would not permit any Moors to remain there, the\r\nChristians, led by blind cupidity, allow them to occupy the land,\r\nbelieving that thus they derive larger revenues--which is an error, as\r\nthe Abbot of Poblet has recently demonstrated by expelling the Mudéjares\r\nfrom the possessions of the abbey. There are said to be forty or fifty\r\nthousand Moorish fighting men in Valencia, which is a source of the\r\ngreatest danger, especially now when the Emperor of Morocco is preparing\r\nto aid the King of Granada. Besides, many enormous crimes are committed\r\nby Christians, in consequence of their damnable familiarity and\r\nintercourse with the Moors, who blaspheme the name of Christ and exalt\r\nthat of Mahomet. \"I have heard,\" he pursues, \"the late Bishop of\r\nValencia declare, in a public sermon, that in that province the mosques\r\nare more numerous than the churches and that half, or more than half,\r\nthe people are ignorant of the Lord's prayer and speak only Moorish. I\r\ntherefore pray your clemency to provide an appropriate remedy, which\r\nwould seem impossible unless the Moors are wholly expelled and unless\r\nthe King of Aragon lends his aid and favor. The nobles would be more\r\nreadily brought to assent to this if they were allowed to seize and sell\r\nthe persons and property of the Mudéjares as public enemies and\r\ninfidels, and the money thus obtained would be of no small service in\r\ndefending the kingdom.\" The Christian prelate, not content with directly\r\nasking the pope to adopt this inhuman proposition, sent a copy of his\r\nletter to Jean de Comminges, Cardinal of Porto, and begged him to urge\r\nthe matter with Benedict, and in a second letter to the cardinal he\r\nexplained that it would be necessary for the pope to order the king to\r\nexpel the Moors; that he would willingly obey as to the crown lands, but\r\nthat a papal command was indispensable as to the lands of others. It was\r\nonly, he added, the avarice of the Christians which kept the Moors\r\nthere.[231] We shall see how, two hundred and seventy years later, an\r\nArchbishop of Valencia aided in bringing about the final catastrophe, by\r\na still greater display of saintly zeal, backed by precisely the same\r\narguments.\r\n\r\nThis constant pressure on the part of their spiritual guides began to\r\nmake an impression on the ruling classes, and repressive legislation\r\nbecomes frequent in the Córtes. In those of Soria, in 1380, the\r\nobnoxious prayer against Christians was ordered to be removed from\r\nJewish prayer-books and its recitation was forbidden under heavy\r\npenalties, while the rabbis were deprived of jurisdiction in criminal\r\ncases between their people. In those of Valladolid, in 1385, Christians\r\nwere forbidden to live among Jews, Jews were prohibited to serve as\r\ntax-collectors, their judges were inhibited to act in civil cases\r\nbetween them and Christians and numerous regulations were adopted to\r\nrestrain their oppression of debtors.[232] In 1387, at the Córtes of\r\nBriviesca, Juan I enacted that no Christian should keep in his house a\r\nJew or Moor, except as a slave, nor converse with one beyond what the\r\nlaw allowed, under the heavy penalty of 6000 maravedís, and no Jew or\r\nMoor should keep Christians in his house under pain of confiscation of\r\nall property and corporal punishment at the king's pleasure.[233] It\r\nseemed impossible to enforce these laws, and the Church intervened by\r\nassuming jurisdiction over the matter. In 1388 the council of Valencia\r\nrequired the suspension of labor on Sundays and feast-days, and it\r\ndeplored the injury to the bodies and souls of the faithful and the\r\nscandals arising from the habitual intercourse between them and the\r\ninfidels. The dwellings of the latter were ordered to be strictly\r\nseparated from those of the former; where special quarters had not been\r\nassigned to them, it was ordered to be done forthwith and, within two\r\nmonths, no Christian should be found dwelling with them nor they with\r\nChristians. If they had trades to work at or merchandise to sell they\r\ncould come out during the day, or occupy booths or shops along the\r\nstreets, but at night they must return to the place where they kept\r\ntheir wives and children.[234]\r\n\r\nThis segregation of the Jews and Moors and their strict confinement to\r\nthe Morerías and Juderías were a practical method of separating the\r\nraces which was difficult of enforcement. The massacres of 1391 showed\r\nthat there were such quarters generally in the larger cities, but\r\nresidence therein seems not to have been obligatory, and Jews and Moors\r\nwho desired it lived among the Christians. In the restrictive laws of\r\n1412, the first place is given to this matter. Morerías and Juderías are\r\nordered to be established everywhere, surrounded with a wall having only\r\none gate. Any one who shall not, in eight days after notice, have\r\nsettled therein forfeits all his property and is liable to punishment at\r\nthe king's pleasure, and severe penalties are provided for Christian\r\nwomen who enter them.[235] An effort was made to enforce these\r\nregulations, but it seemed impossible to keep the races apart. In 1480\r\nFerdinand and Isabella state that the law had not been observed and\r\norder its enforcement, allowing two years for the establishment of the\r\nghettos, after which no Jew or Moor shall dwell outside of them, under\r\nthe established penalties, and no Christian woman be found within\r\nthem.[236] The time had passed for laws to be disregarded and this was\r\ncarried into effect with the customary vigor of the sovereigns. In\r\nSegovia, for instance, on October 29, 1481, Rodrigo Alvárez Maldonado,\r\ncommissioner for the purpose, summoned the representatives of the Jewish\r\naljama, read to them the Ordenanza, and designated to them the limits of\r\ntheir Judería. All Christians resident therein were warned to vacate\r\nwithin the period designated by the law; all Jews of the district were\r\nrequired to make their abode there within the same time, and all doors\r\nand windows of houses contiguous to the boundaries, on either side,\r\nwhether of Jews or Christians, were ordered to be walled up or rendered\r\nimpassable. The segregation of the Jews was to be absolute.[237]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION_]\r\n\r\nWe shall see in the next chapter how successful were the efforts of the\r\nChurch in arousing the greed and fanaticism of the people and in\r\nrepressing the kindly fellowship which had so long existed. From this\r\nthe Jews were the earliest and greatest sufferers, and it is necessary\r\nhere to say only that in the cruel laws which marked the commencement of\r\nthe fifteenth century both Moor and Jew were included in the\r\nrestrictions designed to humiliate them to the utmost, to render their\r\nlives a burden, to deprive them of the means of livelihood and to\r\ndiminish their usefulness to the State. These laws were too severe for\r\nstrict and continuous enforcement, but they answered the purpose of\r\ninflicting an ineffaceable stigma upon their victims and of keeping up a\r\nwholesome feeling of antagonism on the part of the population at large.\r\nThis was directed principally against the Jews, who were the chief\r\nobjects of clerical malignity, and it will be our business to examine\r\nhow this was skilfully developed, until it became the proximate cause of\r\nthe introduction of the Inquisition and created for it, during its\r\nearliest and busiest years, almost the sole field of its activity.\r\nMeanwhile it may be observed that, in the closing triumph over Granada,\r\nthe capitulations accorded by Ferdinand and Isabella were even more\r\nliberal to Jews and Moors than those granted from the eleventh to the\r\nthirteenth century, by such monarchs as Alfonso VI, Ferdinand III,\r\nAlfonso X, and Jaime I. Unless they were deliberately designed as\r\nperfidious traps, they show how little real conscientious conviction lay\r\nbehind the elaborately stimulated fanaticism which destroyed the Jews\r\nand Mudéjares.[238]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE JEWS AND THE CONVERSOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo appreciate properly the position of the Jews in Spain, it is\r\nrequisite first to understand the light in which they were regarded\r\nelsewhere throughout Christendom during the medieval period. It has\r\nalready been seen that the Church held the Jew to be a being deprived,\r\nby the guilt of his ancestors, of all natural rights save that of\r\nexistence. The privileges accorded to the Jews and the social equality\r\nto which they were admitted under the Carlovingians provoked the\r\nseverest animadversions of the churchmen.[239] About 890, Stephen VI\r\nwrites to the Archbishop of Narbonne that he has heard with mortal\r\nanxiety that these enemies of God are allowed to hold land and that\r\nChristians dealt with these dogs and even rendered service to them.[240]\r\nIt is true that Alexander III maintained the ancient rule that they\r\ncould repair their existing synagogues but not build new ones, and\r\nClement III honored himself by one of the rare human utterances in their\r\nfavor, prohibiting their forced conversion, their murder or wounding or\r\nspoliation, their deprivation of religious observances, the exaction of\r\nforced service unless such was customary, or the violation of their\r\ncemeteries in search of treasure, and, moreover, both of these decrees\r\nwere embodied by Gregory IX in the canon law.[241] Yet these\r\nprohibitions only point out to us the manner in which popular zeal\r\napplied the principles enunciated by the Church and, when the council of\r\nParis, in 1212, forbade, under pain of excommunication, Christian\r\nmidwives to attend a Jewess in labor, it shows that they were\r\nauthoritatively regarded as less entitled than beasts to human\r\nsympathy.[242]\r\n\r\nHow popular hostility was aroused and strengthened is illustrated in a\r\nletter addressed, in 1208, by Innocent III to the Count of Nevers.\r\nAlthough, he says, the Jews, against whom the blood of Jesus Christ\r\ncries aloud, are not to be slain, lest Christians should forget the\r\ndivine law, yet are they to be scattered as wanderers over the earth,\r\nthat their faces may be filled with ignominy and they may seek the name\r\nof Jesus Christ. Blasphemers of the Christian name are not to be\r\ncherished by princes, in oppression of the servants of the Lord, but are\r\nrather to be repressed with servitude, of which they rendered themselves\r\nworthy when they laid sacrilegious hands on Him, who had come to give\r\nthem true freedom, and they cried that His blood should be upon them and\r\ntheir children. Yet when prelates and priests intervene to crush their\r\nmalice, they laugh at excommunication and nobles are found who protect\r\nthem. The Count of Nevers is said to be a defender of the Jews; if he\r\ndoes not dread the divine wrath, Innocent threatens to lay hands on him\r\nand punish his disobedience.[243] The Cistercian Cæsarius of\r\nHeisterbach, in his dialogues for the moral instruction of his fellow\r\nmonks, tells several stories which illustrate the utter contempt felt\r\nfor the feelings and rights of Jews, and in one of them there is an\r\nallusion to the curious popular belief that the Jews had a vile odor,\r\nwhich they lost in baptism--a belief prolonged, at least in Spain, until\r\nthe seventeenth century was well advanced.[244] Even so enlightened a\r\nprelate as Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly, in 1416, reproves the sovereigns of\r\nChristendom for their liberality towards the Jews, which he can\r\nattribute only to the vile love of gain; if Jews are allowed to remain,\r\nit should be only as servants to Christians.[245] General prohibitions\r\nof maltreatment availed little when prelate and priest were busy in\r\ninflaming popular aversion and popes were found to threaten any prince\r\nhardy enough to interpose and protect the unfortunate race.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MEDIEVAL PERSECUTION_]\r\n\r\nOf course under such impulsion there was scant ceremony in dealing with\r\nthese outcasts in any way that religious ardor might suggest. When, in\r\n1009, the Saracens captured Jerusalem and destroyed the church of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre, the rage and indignation of Europe assumed so\r\nthreatening a form that multitudes of Jews took refuge in baptism.[246]\r\nWhen religious exaltation culminated in the Crusades, it seemed to those\r\nwho assumed the cross a folly to redeem Palestine while leaving behind\r\nthe impious race that had crucified the Lord, and everywhere, in 1096,\r\nthe assembling of crusaders was the signal for Jewish massacre. It would\r\nbe superfluous to recount in detail the dreary catalogue of wholesale\r\nslaughters which for centuries disgraced Europe, whenever fanaticism or\r\nthe disappearance of a child gave rise to stories of the murder rite, or\r\na blood-stained host suggested sacrilege committed on the sacrament, or\r\nsome passing evil, such as an epidemic, aroused the populace to\r\nbloodshed and rapine. The medieval chronicles are full of such terrible\r\nscenes, in which cruelty and greed assumed the cloak of zeal to avenge\r\nGod; and when, in rare instances, the authorities protected the\r\ndefenceless, it was ascribed to unworthy motives, as in the case of\r\nJohann von Kraichbau, Bishop of Speyer, who, in 1096, not only saved\r\nsome Jews but beheaded their assailants and was accused of being heavily\r\nbribed; nor did Frederic Barbarossa and Ludwig of Bavaria escape similar\r\nimputations.[247] It was safer and more profitable to combine piety and\r\nplunder as when, in April, 1182, Philip Augustus ordered all Jews to\r\nleave France by St. John's day, confiscating their landed property and\r\nallowing them to take their personal effects. His grandson, the saintly\r\nLouis, resorted without scruple to replenishing his treasury by\r\nransoming the Jews and the latter's grandson, Philippe le Bel, was still\r\nmore unscrupulous in 1306, when, by a concerted movement, he seized all\r\nthe Jews in his dominions, stripped them of property, and banished them\r\nunder pain of death. In England King John, in 1210, cast Jews into\r\nprison and tortured them for ransom, and his grandson, Edward I,\r\nfollowed the example of Philip Augustus so effectually that Jews were\r\nnot allowed to return until the time of Cromwell.[248]\r\n\r\nSpain remained so long isolated from the movements which agitated the\r\nrest of Christendom that the abhorrence for the Jew, taught by the\r\nChurch and reduced to practice in so many ways by the people, was late\r\nin development. In the deluge of the Saracen conquest and in the fierce\r\nstruggles of the early Reconquest, the antipathy so savagely expressed\r\nin the Gothic legislation seemed to pass away, possibly because there\r\ncould have been but few Jews among the rude mountaineers of Galicia and\r\nAsturias. It is true that the Wisigothic laws, in the Romance version\r\nknown as the Fuero Juzgo, remained nominally in force; it is also true\r\nthat a law was interpolated in the Fuero, which seems to indicate a\r\nsudden recrudescence of fanaticism after a long interval of comparative\r\ntoleration. It provides that if a Jew loyally embraces the faith of\r\nChrist, he shall have license to trade in all things with Christians,\r\nbut if he subsequently relapses into Judaism his person and property are\r\nforfeit to the king; Jews persisting in their faith shall not consort\r\nwith Christians, but may trade with each other and pay taxes to the\r\nking. Their houses and slaves and lands and orchards and vineyards,\r\nwhich they may have bought from Christians, even though the purchase be\r\nof old date, are declared confiscated to the king, who may bestow them\r\non whom he pleases. If any Jew trades in violation of this law he shall\r\nbecome a slave of the king, with all his property. Christians shall not\r\ntrade with Jews; if a noble does so, he shall forfeit three pounds of\r\ngold to the king; on transactions of more than two pounds, the excess is\r\nforfeit to the king, together with three doblas; if the offender is a\r\ncommoner, he shall receive three hundred lashes.[249]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CONDITION OF SPANISH JEWS_]\r\n\r\nThe date of this law is uncertain, but it presupposes a considerable\r\nanterior period of toleration, during which Jews had multiplied and had\r\nbecome possessed of landed wealth. To what extent it may have been\r\nenforced we have no means of knowing, but its observance must only have\r\nbeen temporary, for such glimpses as we get of the condition of the Jews\r\nup to the fourteenth century are wholly incompatible with the fierce\r\nproscription of the Gothic laws. As the Spanish kingdoms organized\r\nthemselves, the Fuero Juzgo for the most part was superseded by a crowd\r\nof local fueros, _cartas-pueblas_ and customs defining the franchises of\r\neach community, and we have seen in the preceding chapter how in these\r\nboth Moor and Jew were recognized as sharing in the common rights of\r\ncitizenship and how fully the freedom of trade between all classes was\r\npermitted. In 1251 the Fuero Juzgo was formally abrogated in Aragon by\r\nJaime I, who forbade it to be cited in the courts--a measure which\r\ninfers that it had practically become obsolete.[250] In Castile it\r\nlingered somewhat longer and traces of its existence are to be found in\r\nsome places until the end of the thirteenth century.[251] These,\r\nhowever, are not to be construed as referring to the provisions\r\nrespecting Jews, which had long been superseded.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Jews formed too large and important a portion of the\r\npopulation to be treated without consideration. The sovereigns, involved\r\npermanently in struggles with the Saracen and with mutinous nobles,\r\nfound it necessary to utilize all the resources at their command,\r\nwhether in money, intelligence, or military service. In the first two of\r\nthese the Jews stood pre-eminent, nor were they remiss in the latter. On\r\nthe disastrous field of Zalaca, in 1086, forty thousand Jews are said to\r\nhave followed the banner of Alfonso VI, and the slaughter they endured\r\nproved their devotion, while, at the defeat of Ucles in 1108, they\r\ncomposed nearly the whole left wing of the Castilian host.[252] In 1285\r\nwe hear of Jews and Moors aiding the Aragonese in their assaults on the\r\nretreating forces of Philippe le Hardi.[253] As regards money, the\r\ntraffic and finance of Spain were largely in their hands, and they\r\nfurnished, with the Moors, the readiest source from which to derive\r\nrevenue. Every male who had married, or who had reached the age of 20,\r\npaid an annual poll tax of three gold maravedís; there were also a\r\nnumber of imposts peculiar to them, and, in addition, they shared with\r\nthe rest of the population in the complicated and ruinous system of\r\ntaxation--the ordinary and extraordinary _servicios_, the _pedidas_ and\r\n_ayudas_, the _sacos_ and _pastos_ and the _alcavalas_. Besides this\r\nthey assisted in supporting the municipalities or the lordships and\r\nprelacies under which they lived, with the _tallas_, the _pastos_, the\r\nninths or elevenths of merchandise and the _peajes_ and _barcajes_, the\r\n_pontazgos_ and _portazgos_, or tolls of various kinds which were\r\nheavier on them than on Christians, and, moreover, the Church received\r\nfrom them the customary tithes, oblations, and first-fruits.[254] The\r\nrevenues from the Jewish aljamas, or communities, were always regarded\r\nas among the surest resources of the crown.\r\n\r\nThe shrewd intelligence and practical ability of the Jews, moreover,\r\nrendered their services in public affairs almost indispensable. It was\r\nin vain that the council of Rome, in 1078, renewed the old prohibitions\r\nto confide to them functions which would place them in command over\r\nChristians and equally in vain that, in 1081, Gregory VII addressed to\r\nAlfonso VI a vehement remonstrance on the subject, assuring him that to\r\ndo so was to oppress the Church of God and exalt the synagogue of Satan,\r\nand that in seeking to please the enemies of Christ he was contemning\r\nChrist himself.[255] In fact, the most glorious centuries of the\r\nReconquest were those in which the Jews enjoyed the greatest power in\r\nthe courts of kings, prelates and nobles, in Castile and Aragon. The\r\ntreasuries of the kingdoms were virtually in their hands, and it was\r\ntheir skill in organizing the supplies that rendered practicable the\r\nenterprises of such monarchs as Alfonso VI and VII, Fernando III and\r\nJaime I.[256] To treat them as the Goths had done, or as the Church\r\nprescribed, had become a manifest impossibility.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CONDITION OF SPANISH JEWS_]\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it was natural that their numbers should\r\nincrease until they formed a notable portion of the population. Of this\r\nan estimate can be made from a _repartimiento_, or assessment of taxes,\r\nin 1284, which shows that in Castile they paid a poll tax of 2,561,855\r\ngold maravedís, which at three maravedís per head infers a total of\r\n853,951 married or adult males.[257] This large aggregate was thoroughly\r\norganized. Each aljama or community had its rabbis with a Rabb Mayor at\r\nits head. Then each district, comprising one or more Christian\r\nbishoprics, was presided over by a Rabb Mayor, and, above all, was the\r\n_Gaon_ or _Nassi_, the prince, whose duty it was to see that the laws of\r\nthe race, both civil and religious, were observed in their purity.[258]\r\nAs we have already seen, all questions between themselves were settled\r\nbefore their own judges under their own code, and even when a Jew was\r\nprosecuted criminally by the king, he was punishable in accordance with\r\nhis own law.[259] So complete was the respect paid to this that their\r\nSabbaths and other feasts were held inviolate; on these days they could\r\nnot be summoned to court or be interfered with except by arrest for\r\ncrime. Even polygamy was allowed to them.[260]\r\n\r\nWhile their religion and laws were thus respected, they were required to\r\nrespect Christianity. They were not allowed to read or keep books\r\ncontrary to their own law or to the Christian law. Proselytism from\r\nChristianity was punishable by death and confiscation, and any insults\r\noffered to God, the Virgin, or the saints, were visited with a fine of\r\nten maravedís or a hundred lashes.[261] Yet, if we are to believe the\r\nindignant Lucas of Tuy, writing about 1230, these simple restraints were\r\nscarce enforced. The heretic Cathari of Leon, he tells us, were wont to\r\ncircumcise themselves in order, under the guise of Jews, to propound\r\nheretical dogmas and dispute with Christians; what they dared not utter\r\nas heretics they could freely disseminate as Jews. The governors and\r\njudges of the cities listened approvingly to heresies put forth by Jews,\r\nwho were their friends and familiars, and if any one, inflamed by pious\r\nzeal, angered these Jews, he was treated as if he had touched the apple\r\nof the eye of the ruler; they also taught other Jews to blaspheme Christ\r\nand thus the Catholic faith was perverted.[262]\r\n\r\nThis represents a laxity of toleration impossible in any other land at\r\nthe period, yet the Spanish Jews were not wholly shielded from inroads\r\nof foreign fanaticism. Before the crusading spirit had been organized\r\nfor the conquest of the Holy Land, ardent knights sometimes came to wage\r\nwar with the Spanish Saracens, and their religious fervor was aggrieved\r\nby the freedom enjoyed by the Jews. About 1068, bands of these strangers\r\ntreated them as they had been wont to do at home, slaying and plundering\r\nthem without mercy. The Church of Spain was as yet uncontaminated by\r\nrace hatred and the bishops interposed to save the victims. For this\r\nthey were warmly praised by Alexander II, who denounced the crusaders as\r\nacting either from foolish ignorance or blind cupidity. Those whom they\r\nwould slay, he said, were perhaps predestined by God to salvation; he\r\ncited Gregory I to the same effect and pointed out the difference\r\nbetween Jews and Saracens, the latter of whom make war on Christians and\r\ncould justly be assailed.[263] Had the chair of St. Peter always been so\r\nworthily filled, infinite misery might have been averted and the history\r\nof Christendom been spared some of its most repulsive pages.\r\n\r\nWhen the crusading spirit extended to Spain, it sometimes aroused\r\nsimilar tendencies. In 1108, Archbishop Bernardo of Toledo took the\r\ncross and religious exaltation was ardent. The disastrous rout of Ucles\r\ncame and was popularly ascribed to the Jews in the Castilian army,\r\narousing indignation which manifested itself in a massacre at Toledo and\r\nin the burning of synagogues. Alfonso VI vainly endeavored to detect and\r\npunish those responsible and his death, in 1109, was followed by similar\r\noutrages which remained unavenged.[264] This was a sporadic outburst\r\nwhich soon exhausted itself. A severer trial came from abroad, when, in\r\n1210, the Legate Arnaud of Narbonne led his crusading hosts to the\r\nassistance of Alfonso IX. Although their zeal for the faith was\r\nexhausted by the capture of Calatrava and few of them remained to share\r\nin the crowning glories of Las Navas de Tolosa, their ardor was\r\nsufficient to prompt an onslaught on the unoffending Jews. The native\r\nnobles sought in vain to protect the victims, who were massacred without\r\nmercy, so that Abravanel declares this to have been one of the bloodiest\r\npersecutions that they had suffered and that more Jews fled from Spain\r\nthan Moses led out of Egypt.[265]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CONDITION OF SPANISH JEWS_]\r\n\r\nThis had no permanent influence on the condition of the Spanish Hebrews.\r\nDuring the long reigns of San Fernando III and Alfonso X of Castile and\r\nof Jaime I of Aragon, covering the greater part of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the services which they rendered to the monarchs were repaid\r\nwith increasing favor and protection. After Jaime had conquered Minorca\r\nhe took, in 1247, all Jews settling there under the royal safeguard and\r\nthreatened a fine of a thousand gold pieces for wrong inflicted on any\r\nof them and, in 1250, he required that Jewish as well as Christian\r\ntestimony must be furnished in all actions, civil or criminal, brought\r\nby Christians against Jews. So, when in 1306 Philippe le Bel expelled\r\nthe Jews from France and those of Majorca feared the same fate, Jaime II\r\nreassured them by pledging the royal faith that they should remain\r\nforever in the land, with full security for person and property, a\r\npledge confirmed, in 1311, by his son and successor Sancho.[266] In\r\nCastile, when San Fernando conquered Seville, in 1244, he gave to the\r\nJews a large space in the city, and, in defiance of the canons, he\r\nallotted to them four Moorish mosques to be converted into synagogues,\r\nthus founding the aljama of Seville, destined to a history so\r\ndeplorable. Alfonso X, during his whole reign, patronized Jewish men of\r\nlearning, whom he employed in translating works of value from Arabic and\r\nHebrew; he built for them an observatory in Seville, where were made the\r\nrecords embodied in the Alfonsine Tables; he permitted those of Toledo\r\nto erect the magnificent synagogue now known as Santa María la Blanca,\r\nand Jews fondly relate that the Hebrew school, which he transferred from\r\nCórdova to Toledo, numbered twelve thousand students.[267] He was prompt\r\nto maintain their privileges, and, when the Jews of Burgos complained\r\nthat in mixed suits the alcaldes would grant appeals to him when the\r\nChristian suitor was defeated, while refusing them to defeated Jews, he\r\nat once put an end to the discrimination, a decree which Sancho IV\r\nenforced with a penalty of a hundred maravedís when, in 1295, the\r\ncomplaint was repeated.[268] Yet Alfonso, in his systematic code known\r\nas the Partidas, which was not confirmed by the Córtes until 1348,\r\nallowed himself to be influenced by the teachings of the Church and the\r\nmaxims of the imperial jurisprudence. He accepted the doctrine of the\r\ncanons that the Jew was merely suffered to live in captivity among\r\nChristians; he was forbidden to speak ill of the Christian faith, and\r\nany attempt at proselytism was punished with death and confiscation. The\r\nmurder rite was alluded to as a rumor, but in case it was practised it\r\nwas a capital offence and the culprits were to be tried before the king\r\nhimself. Jews were ineligible to any office in which they could oppress\r\nChristians; they were forbidden to have Christian servants, and the\r\npurchase of a Christian slave involved the death punishment. They were\r\nnot to associate with Christians in eating, drinking, and bathing and\r\nthe amour of a Jew with a Christian woman incurred death. While Jewish\r\nphysicians might prescribe for Christian patients, the medicine must be\r\ncompounded by a Christian, and the wearing of the hateful distinctive\r\nbadge was ordered under penalty of ten gold maravedís or of ten lashes.\r\nAt the same time Christians were strictly forbidden to commit any wrong\r\non the person or property of Jews or to interfere in any way with their\r\nreligious observances, and no coercion was to be used to induce them to\r\nbaptism, for Christ wishes only willing service.[269]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ATTEMPTS AT CONVERSION_]\r\n\r\nThis was prophetic of evil days in the future and the reign of Alfonso\r\nproved to be the culminating point of Jewish prosperity. The capital and\r\ncommerce of the land were to a great extent in their hands; they managed\r\nits finances and collected its revenues. King, noble and prelate\r\nentrusted their affairs to Jews, whose influence consequently was felt\r\neverywhere. To precipitate them from this position to the servitude\r\nprescribed by the canons required a prolonged struggle and may be said\r\nto have taken its remote origin in an attempt at their conversion. In\r\n1263 the Dominican Fray Pablo Christiá, a converted Jew, challenged the\r\ngreatest rabbi of the day, Moseh aben Najman, to a disputation which was\r\npresided over by Jaime I in his Barcelona palace. Each champion of\r\ncourse boasted of victory; the king dismissed Nachmanides not only with\r\nhonor but with the handsome reward of three hundred pieces of gold, but\r\nhe ordered certain Jewish books to be burnt and blasphemous passages in\r\nthe Talmud to be expunged.[270] He further issued a decree ordering all\r\nhis faithful Jews to assemble and listen reverently to Fray Pablo\r\nwhenever he desired to dispute with them, to furnish him with what books\r\nhe desired, and to defray his expenses, which they could deduct from\r\ntheir tribute.[271] Two years later Fray Pablo challenged another\r\nprominent Hebrew, the Rabbi Ben-Astruch, chief of the synagogue of\r\nGerona, who refused until he had the pledge of King Jaime, and of the\r\ngreat Dominican St. Ramon de Peñafort, that he should not be held\r\naccountable for what he might utter in debate, but when, at the request\r\nof the Bishop of Gerona, Ben-Astruch wrote out his argument, the frailes\r\nPablo and Ramon accused him of blasphemy, for it was manifestly\r\nimpossible that a Jew could defend his strict monotheism and Messianic\r\nbelief without a course of reasoning that would appear blasphemous to\r\nsusceptible theologians. The rabbi alleged the royal pledge; Jaime\r\nproposed that he should be banished for two years and his book be burnt,\r\nbut this did not satisfy the Dominican frailes and he dismissed the\r\nmatter, forbidding the prosecution of the rabbi except before himself.\r\nAppeal seems to have been made to Clement IV, who addressed King Jaime\r\nin wrathful mood, blaming him for the favor shown to Jews and ordering\r\nhim to deprive them of office and to depress and trample on them;\r\nBen-Astruch especially, he said, should be made an example without,\r\nhowever, mutilating or slaying him.[272] This explosion of papal\r\nindignation fell harmless, but the zeal of the Dominicans had been\r\ninflamed and in laboring for the conversion of the Jews they not\r\nunnaturally aroused antagonism toward those who refused to abandon their\r\nfaith. So long before as 1242, Jaime had issued an edict, confirmed by\r\nInnocent IV in 1245, empowering the Mendicant friars to have free access\r\nto Juderías and Morerías, to assemble the inhabitants and compel them to\r\nlisten to sermons intended for their conversion.[273] The Dominicans now\r\navailed themselves of this with such vigor and excited such hostility to\r\nthe Jews that Jaime was obliged to step forward for their protection. He\r\nassured the aljamas that they were not accountable for what was\r\ncontained in their books, unless it was to the dishonor of Christ, the\r\nVirgin and the saints, and all accusations must be submitted to him in\r\nperson; their freedom of trade was not to be curtailed; meat slaughtered\r\nby them could be freely exposed for sale in the Juderías, but not\r\nelsewhere; dealing in skins was not to be interfered with; their\r\nsynagogues and cemeteries were to be subject to their exclusive control;\r\ntheir right to receive interest on loans was not to be impaired nor\r\ntheir power to collect debts; they were not to be compelled to listen to\r\nthe friars outside of their Juderías, because otherwise they were liable\r\nto insult and dishonor, nor were the frailes when preaching in the\r\nsynagogues to be accompanied by disorderly mobs, but at most by ten\r\ndiscreet Christians; finally, no novel limitations were to be imposed on\r\nthem except by royal command after hearing them in opposition.[274]\r\n\r\nThese provisions indicate the direction in which Dominican zeal was\r\nstriving to curtail the privileges so long enjoyed by the Jews and the\r\nroyal intention to protect them against local legislation, which had\r\ndoubtless been attempted under this impulsion. They were not remiss in\r\ngratitude, for when, in 1274, Jaime attended the council of Lyons, they\r\ncontributed seventy-one thousand _sueldos_ to enable him to appear with\r\nfitting magnificence.[275] The royal protection was speedily needed, for\r\nthe tide of persecuting zeal was rising among the clergy and, shortly\r\nafter his return from Lyons, on a Good Friday, the ecclesiastics of\r\nGerona rang the bells, summoned the populace and attacked the Judería,\r\nwhich was one of the largest and most flourishing in Catalonia. They\r\nwould have succeeded in destroying it but for the interposition of\r\nJaime, who chanced to be in the city and who defended the Jews with\r\nforce of arms.[276]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CONVERSION AND PERSECUTION_]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Jaime, in 1276, the ecclesiastics seem to have\r\nthought that they could safely obey the commands of Clement IV,\r\nespecially as Nicholas IV, in 1278, instructed the Dominican general to\r\ndepute pious brethren everywhere to convoke the Jews and labor for their\r\nconversion, with the significant addition that lists of those refusing\r\nbaptism were to be made out and submitted to him, when he would\r\ndetermine what was to be done with them.[277] How the frailes\r\ninterpreted the papal utterances is indicated in a letter of Pedro III\r\nto Pedro Bishop of Gerona, in April of this same year, 1278, reciting\r\nthat he had already appealed repeatedly to him to put an end to the\r\nassaults of the clergy on the Jews, and now he learns that they have\r\nagain attacked the Judería, stoning it from the tower of the cathedral\r\nand from their own houses and then assaulting it, laying waste the\r\ngardens and vineyards of the Jews and even destroying their graves and,\r\nwhen the royal herald stood up to forbid the work, drowning his voice\r\nwith yells and derisions. Pedro accuses the bishop of stimulating the\r\nclergy to these outrages and orders him to put a stop to it and punish\r\nthe offenders.[278] He was still more energetic when the French crusade\r\nunder Philippe le Hardi was advancing to the siege of Gerona, in 1285,\r\nand his Moorish soldiers in the garrison undertook to sack the _Call\r\nJuhich_, or Judería, when he threw himself among them, mace in hand,\r\nstruck down a number and finished by hanging several of them.[279] He\r\noffered no impediment, however, to the conversion of the Jews for, in\r\n1279, he ordered his officials to compel them to listen to the\r\nFranciscans, who, in obedience to the commands of the pope, might wish\r\nto preach to them in their synagogues.[280] These intrusions of frailes\r\ninto the Juderías inevitably led to trouble, for there is significance\r\nin a letter of Jaime II, April 4, 1305, to his representative in Palma,\r\nalluding to recent scandals, for the future prevention of which he\r\norders that no priest shall enter the Judería to administer the\r\nsacraments without being accompanied by a secular official. This\r\nprecaution was unavailing, for it doubtless was a continuance of such\r\nprovocation that led to a disturbance, about 1315, affording to King\r\nJaime an excuse for confiscating the whole property of the aljama of\r\nPalma and then commuting the penalty to a fine of 95,000 _libras_. The\r\nsource of these troubles is suggested by a royal order of 1327 to the\r\nGovernor of Majorca, forbidding the baptism of Jewish children under\r\nseven years of age or the forcible baptism of Jews of any age.[281]\r\n\r\nDuring all this period there had been an Inquisition in Aragon which, of\r\ncourse, could not interfere with Jews as such, for they were beyond its\r\njurisdiction, but which stood ready to punish more or less veritable\r\nefforts at propagandism or offences of fautorship. The crown had no\r\nobjection to using it as a means of extortion, while preventing it from\r\nexterminating or crippling subjects so useful. A diploma of Jaime II,\r\nOctober 14, 1311, recites that the inquisitor, Fray Juan Llotger, had\r\nlearned that the aljamas of Barcelona, Tarragona, Monblanch and\r\nVilafranca had harbored and fed certain Jewish converts, who had\r\nrelapsed to Judaism, as well as others who had come from foreign parts.\r\nHe had given Fray Juan the necessary support, enabling him to verify the\r\naccusations on the spot and had received his report to that effect. Now,\r\ntherefore, he issues a free and full pardon to the offending aljamas,\r\nwith assurance that they shall not be prosecuted either civilly or\r\ncriminally, for which grace, on October 10th, they had paid him ten\r\nthousand sueldos. In this case there seems to have been no regular trial\r\nby the Inquisition, the king having superseded it by his action. In\r\nanother more serious case he intervened after trial and sentence to\r\ncommute the punishment. In 1326 the aljama of Calatayud subjected itself\r\nto the Inquisition by not only receiving back a woman who had been\r\nbaptized but by circumcising two Christians. Tried by the inquisitor and\r\nthe Bishop of Tarazona it had been found guilty and it had been\r\nsentenced to a fine of twenty thousand sueldos and its members to\r\nconfiscation, but King Jaime, by a cédula of February 6, 1326, released\r\nthem from the confiscation and all other penalties on payment of the\r\nfine.[282]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CURTAILMENT OF PRIVILEGES_]\r\n\r\nAlthough Castile was slower than Aragon to receive impulses from abroad,\r\nin the early fourteenth century we begin to find traces of a similar\r\nmovement of the Church against the Jews. In 1307 the aljama of Toledo\r\ncomplained to Fernando IV that the dean and chapter had obtained from\r\nClement V bulls conferring on them jurisdiction over Jews, in virtue of\r\nwhich they were enforcing the canons against usury and stripping the\r\nJewish community of its property. At this time there was no question in\r\nSpain, such as we shall see debated hereafter, of the royal prerogative\r\nto control obnoxious papal letters, and Fernando at once ordered the\r\nchapter to surrender the bulls; all action under them was pronounced\r\nvoid and restitution in double was threatened for all damage inflicted.\r\nThe Jews, he said, were his Jews; they were not to be incapacitated\r\nfrom paying their taxes and the pope had no power to infringe on the\r\nrights of the crown. He instructed Ferran Nuñez de Pantoja to compel\r\nobedience and, after some offenders had been arrested, the frightened\r\ncanons surrendered the bulls and abandoned their promising speculation,\r\nbut the affair left behind it enmities which displayed themselves\r\ndeplorably afterwards.[283]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the royal favor and protection, the legislation of the\r\nperiod commences to manifest a tendency to limit the privileges of the\r\nJews, showing that popular sentiment was gradually turning against them.\r\nAs early as 1286 Sancho IV agreed to deprive them of their special\r\njudges and, though the law was not generally enforced, it indicates the\r\nspirit that called for it and procured its repetition in the Córtes of\r\nValladolid in 1307.[284] Complaints were loud and numerous of the Jewish\r\ntax-gatherers, and the young Fernando IV was obliged repeatedly to\r\npromise that the revenues should not be farmed out nor their collection\r\nbe entrusted to caballeros, ecclesiastics or Jews. The turbulence which\r\nattended his minority and short reign and the minority of his son,\r\nAlfonso XI, afforded a favorable opportunity for the manifestation of\r\nhostility and the royal power was too weak to prevent the curtailment in\r\nvarious directions of the Jewish privileges.[285] We have seen, in the\r\npreceding chapter, the temper in which the Spanish prelates returned\r\nfrom the Council of Vienne in 1312 and the proscriptive legislation\r\nenacted by them in the Council of Zamora in 1313 and its successors.\r\nEverything favored the development of this spirit of intolerance, and at\r\nthe Córtes of Burgos, in 1315, the regents of the young Alfonso XI\r\nconceded that the Clementine canon, abrogating all laws that permitted\r\nusury, should be enforced, that all mixed actions, civil and criminal,\r\nshould be tried by the royal judges, that the evidence of a Jew should\r\nnot be received against a Christian while that of a Christian was good\r\nagainst a Jew, that Jews were not to assume Christian names, Christian\r\nnurses were not to suckle Jews and sumptuary laws were directed against\r\nthe luxury of Jewish vestments.[286]\r\n\r\nThis may be said to mark the commencement of the long struggle which, in\r\nspite of their wonderful powers of resistance, was to end in the\r\ndestruction of the Spanish Jews. Throughout the varying phases of the\r\nconflict, the Church, in its efforts to arouse popular hatred, was\r\npowerfully aided by the odium which the Jews themselves excited through\r\ntheir ostentation, their usury and their functions as public officials.\r\n\r\nA strong race is not apt to be an amiable one. The Jews were proud of\r\ntheir ancient lineage and the purity of their descent from the kings and\r\nheroes of the Old Testament. A man who could trace his ancestry to David\r\nwould look with infinite scorn on the hidalgos who boasted of the blood\r\nof Lain Calvo and, if the favor of the monarch rendered safe the\r\nexpression of his feelings, his haughtiness was not apt to win friends\r\namong those who repaid his contempt with interest. The Oriental fondness\r\nfor display was a grievous offence among the people. The wealth of the\r\nkingdom was, to a great extent, in Jewish hands, affording ample\r\nopportunity of contrast between their magnificence and the poverty of\r\nthe Christian multitude, and the lavish extravagance with which they\r\nadorned themselves, their women and their retainers, was well fitted to\r\nexcite envy more potent for evil because more wide-spread than enmity\r\narising from individual wrongs.[287] Shortly before the catastrophe, at\r\nthe close of the fifteenth century, Affonso V of Portugal, who was\r\nwell-affected towards them, asked the chief rabbi, Joseph-Ibn-Jachia,\r\nwhy he did not prevent his people from a display provocative of the\r\nassertion that their wealth was derived from robbery of the Christians,\r\nadding that he required no answer, for nothing save spoliation and\r\nmassacre would cure them of it.[288]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CAUSES OF ENMITY_]\r\n\r\nA more practical and far-reaching cause of enmity was the usury, through\r\nwhich a great portion of their wealth was acquired. The money-lender has\r\neverywhere been an unpopular character and, in the Middle Ages, he was\r\nespecially so. When the Church pronounced any interest or any advantage,\r\ndirect or indirect, derived from loans to be a sin for which the sinner\r\ncould not be admitted to penance without making restitution; when the\r\njustification of taking interest was regarded as a heresy to be punished\r\nas such by the Inquisition, a stigma was placed on the money-lender, his\r\ngains were rendered hazardous, and his calling became one which an\r\nhonorable Christian could not follow.[289] Mercantile Italy early\r\noutgrew these dogmas which retarded so greatly all material development\r\nand it managed to reconcile, _per fas et nefas_, the canons with the\r\npractical necessities of business, but elsewhere throughout Europe,\r\nwherever Jews were allowed to exist, the lending of money or goods on\r\ninterest inevitably fell, for the most part, into their hands, for they\r\nwere governed by their own moral code and were not subject to the\r\nChurch. It exhausted all devices to coerce them through their rulers,\r\nbut the object aimed at was too incompatible with the necessities of\r\nadvancing civilization to have any influence save the indefinite\r\npostponement of relief to the borrower.[290]\r\n\r\nThe unsavoriness of the calling, its risks and the scarcity of coin\r\nduring the Middle Ages, conspired to render the current rates of\r\ninterest exorbitantly oppressive. In Aragon the Jews were allowed to\r\ncharge 20 per cent. per annum, in Castile 33-1/3,[291] and the constant\r\nrepetition of these limitations and the provisions against all manner of\r\ningenious devices, by fictitious sales and other frauds, to obtain an\r\nillegal increase, show how little the laws were respected in the\r\ngrasping avarice with which the Jews speculated on the necessities of\r\ntheir customers.[292] In 1326 the aljama of Cuenca, considering the\r\nlegal rate of 33-1/3 per cent. too low, refused absolutely to lend\r\neither money or wheat for the sowing. This caused great distress and the\r\ntown-council entered into negotiations, resulting in an agreement by\r\nwhich the Jews were authorized to charge 40 per cent.[293] In 1385 the\r\nCórtes of Valladolid describe one cause of the necessity of submitting\r\nto whatever exactions the Jews saw fit to impose, when it says that the\r\nnew lords, to whom Henry of Trastamara had granted towns and villages,\r\nwere accustomed to imprison their vassals and starve and torture them to\r\nforce payment of what they had not got, obliging them to get money from\r\nJews to whom they gave whatever bonds were demanded.[294] Monarchs as\r\nwell as peasants were subject to these impositions. In Navarre, a law of\r\nFelipe III, in 1330, limited the rate of interest to 20 per cent. and we\r\nfind this paid by his grandson, Carlos III, in 1399, for a loan of 1000\r\nflorins but, in 1401, he paid at the rate of 35 per cent. for a loan of\r\n2000 florins, and in 1402 his queen, Doña Leonor, borrowed 70 florins\r\nfrom her Jewish physician Abraham at four florins a month, giving him\r\nsilver plate as security; finding at the end of twenty-one months that\r\nthe interest amounted to 84 florins, she begged a reduction and he\r\ncontented himself with 30 florins.[295]\r\n\r\nWhen money could be procured in no other way, when the burgher had to\r\nraise it to pay his taxes or the extortions of his lord and the\r\nhusbandman had to procure seed-corn or starve, it is easy to see how all\r\nhad to submit to the exactions of the money-lender; how, in spite of\r\noccasional plunder and scaling of debts, the Jews absorbed the floating\r\ncapital of the community and how recklessly they aided the frailes in\r\nconcentrating popular detestation on themselves. It was in vain that the\r\nOrdenamiento de Alcalá, in 1348, prohibited usury to Moors and Jews as\r\nwell as to Christians; it was an inevitable necessity and it continued\r\nto flourish.[296]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CAUSES OF ENMITY_]\r\n\r\nEqually effective in arousing antipathy were the functions of the Jews\r\nas holders of office and especially as _almojarifes_ and\r\n_recabdores_--farmers of the revenues and collectors of taxes, which\r\nbrought them into the closest and most exasperating relations with the\r\npeople. In that age of impoverished treasuries and rude financial\r\nexpedients, the customary mode of raising funds was by farming out the\r\nrevenues to the highest bidder of specific sums; as the profit of the\r\nspeculation depended on the amount to be wrung from the people, the\r\nsubordinate collectors would be merciless in exaction and indefatigable\r\nin tracing out delinquents, exciting odium which extended to all the\r\nrace. It was in vain that the Church repeatedly prohibited the\r\nemployment of Jews in public office. Their ability and skill rendered\r\nthem indispensable to monarchs, nobles, and prelates, and the complaints\r\nwhich arose against them on all sides were useless. Thus in the quarrel\r\nbetween the chapter of Toledo and the great Archbishop Rodrigo, in which\r\nthe former appealed to Gregory IX, in 1236, one of the grievances\r\nalleged is that he appointed Jews to be provosts of the common table of\r\nthe chapter, thus enabling them to defraud the canons; they even passed\r\nthrough the church and often entered the chapter-house itself to the\r\ngreat scandal of all Christians; they collected the tithes and thirds\r\nand governed the vassals and possessions of the Church, greatly\r\nenriching themselves by plundering the patrimony of the Crucified,\r\nwherefore the pope was earnestly prayed to expel the Jews from these\r\noffices and compel them to make restitution.[297]\r\n\r\nWhen prelates such as Archbishop Rodrigo paid so little heed to the\r\ncommands of the Church, it is not to be supposed that monarchs were more\r\nobedient or were disposed to forego the advantages derivable from the\r\nservices of these accomplished financiers. How these men assisted their\r\nmasters while enriching themselves is exemplified by Don Çag de la\r\nMaleha, _almojarife mayor_ to Alfonso X. When the king, in 1257, was\r\nraising an army to subdue Aben-Nothfot, King of Niebla, Don Çag\r\nundertook to defray all the expenses of the campaign in consideration of\r\nthe assignment to him of certain taxes, some of which he was still\r\nenjoying in 1272.[298] It was useless for the people who groaned under\r\nthe exactions of these efficient officials to protest against their\r\nemployment and to extort from the monarchs repeated promises no longer\r\nto employ them. The promises were never kept and, until the reign of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, this source of irritation continued. There was,\r\nit is true, one exception, the result of which was not conducive to a\r\ncontinuance of the experiment. In 1385 the Córtes of Valladolid obtained\r\nfrom Juan I a decree prohibiting the employment of Jews as\r\ntax-collectors, not only by the king but also by prelates and nobles, in\r\nconsequence of which ecclesiastics obtained the collection of the royal\r\nrevenues, but when they were called upon to settle they excommunicated\r\nthe alcaldes who sought to compel payment, leading to great confusion\r\nand bitterer complaints than ever.[299]\r\n\r\nWhen the Jews thus gave grounds so ample for popular dislike, it says\r\nmuch for the kindly feeling between the races that the efforts of the\r\nChurch to excite a spirit of intolerance made progress so slow. These\r\ntook form, as a comprehensive and systematic movement at the Council of\r\nZamora, in 1313, and its successors, described in the preceding chapter,\r\nbut in spite of them Alfonso XI continued to protect his Jewish subjects\r\nand the labors of the good fathers awoke no popular response. In Aragon\r\na canon of the Council of Lérida, in 1325, forbidding Christians to be\r\npresent at Jewish weddings and circumcisions, shows how fruitless as yet\r\nhad been the effort to produce mutual alienation.[300]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE BLACK DEATH_]\r\n\r\nNavarre had the earliest foretaste of the wrath to come. It was then\r\nunder its French princes and, when Charles le Bel died, February 1,\r\n1328, a zealous Franciscan, Fray Pedro Olligoyen, apparently taking\r\nadvantage of the interregnum, stirred, with his eloquent preaching, the\r\npeople to rise against the Jews, and led them to pillage and slaughter.\r\nThe storm burst on the aljama of Estella, March 1st, and rapidly spread\r\nthroughout the kingdom. Neither age nor sex was spared and the number of\r\nvictims is variously estimated at from six to ten thousand. Queen Jeanne\r\nand her husband Philippe d'Evreux, who succeeded to the throne, caused\r\nOlligoyen to be prosecuted, but the result is not known. They further\r\nspeculated on the terrible massacre by imposing heavy fines on Estella\r\nand Viana and by seizing the property of the dead and fugitive Jews, and\r\nthey also levied on the ruined aljamas the sum of fifteen thousand\r\nlivres to defray their coronation expenses. Thus fatally weakened, the\r\nJews of Navarre were unable to endure the misfortunes of the long and\r\ndisastrous reign of Charles le Mauvais (1350-1387). A general emigration\r\nresulted, to arrest which Charles prohibited the purchase of landed\r\nproperty from Jews without special royal license. A list of taxables, in\r\n1366, shows only 453 Jewish families and 150 Moorish, not including\r\nPampeluna, where both races were taxable by the bishop. Although Charles\r\nand his son Charles le Noble (1387-1425) had Jews for almojarifes, it\r\nwas in vain that they endeavored to allure the fugitives back by\r\nprivileges and exemptions. The aljamas continued to dwindle until the\r\nrevenue from them was inconsiderable.[301]\r\n\r\nIn Castile and Aragon the Black Death caused massacres of Jews, as\r\nelsewhere throughout Europe, though not so wide-spread and terrible. In\r\nCatalonia the troubles commenced at Barcelona and spread to other\r\nplaces, in spite of the efforts of Pedro IV, both in prevention and\r\npunishment. They had little special religious significance, but were\r\nrather the result of the relaxation of social order in the fearful\r\ndisorganization accompanying the pestilence and, after it had passed,\r\nthe survivors, Christians, Jews and Mudéjares were for a moment knit\r\nmore closely together in the bonds of a common humanity.[302] It is to\r\nthe credit of Clement VI that he did what he could to arrest the\r\nfanaticism which, especially in Germany, offered to the Jews the\r\nalternative of death or baptism. Following, as he said, in the footsteps\r\nof Calixtus II, Eugenius III, Alexander III, Clement III, Coelestin\r\nIII, Innocent III, Gregory IX, Nicholas III, Honorius IV and Nicholas\r\nIV, he pointed out the absurdity of attributing the plague to the Jews.\r\nThey had offered to submit to judicial examination and sentence, besides\r\nwhich the pestilence raged in lands where there were no Jews. He\r\ntherefore ordered all prelates to proclaim to the people assembled for\r\nworship that Jews were not to be beaten, wounded, or slain and that\r\nthose who so treated them were subjected to the anathema of the Holy\r\nSee. It was a timely warning and worthy of one who spoke in the name of\r\nChrist, but it availed little to overcome the influence of the assiduous\r\nteaching of intolerance through so many centuries.[303]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INCREASING HOSTILITY_]\r\n\r\nWhen Pedro the Cruel ascended the throne of Castile, in 1350, the Jews\r\nmight reasonably look forward to a prosperous future, but his reign in\r\nreality proved the turning-point in their fortunes. He surrounded\r\nhimself with Jews and confided to them the protection of his person,\r\nwhile the rebellious faction, headed by Henry of Trastamara, his\r\nillegitimate brother, declared themselves the enemies of the race and\r\nused Pedro's favor for them as a political weapon. He was asserted to be\r\na Jew, substituted for a girl born of Queen María whose husband,\r\nAlfonso XI, was said to have sworn that he would kill her if she did not\r\ngive him a boy. It was also reported that he was no Christian but an\r\nadherent to the Law of Moses and that the government of Castile was\r\nwholly in the hands of Jews. It was not difficult therefore to arouse\r\nclerical hostility, as manifested by Urban V, who denounced him as a\r\nrebel to the Church, a fautor of Jews and Moors, a propagator of\r\ninfidelity and a slayer of Christians.[304] Of this the insurgents took\r\nfull advantage and demonstrated their piety in the most energetic\r\nmanner. When, in 1355, Henry of Trastamara and his brother, the Master\r\nof Santiago, entered Toledo to liberate Queen Blanche, who was confined\r\nin the alcázar, they sacked the smaller Judería and slew its twelve\r\nhundred inmates without sparing sex or age. They also besieged the\r\nprincipal Judería, which was walled around and defended by Pedro's\r\nfollowers until his arrival with reinforcements drove off the\r\nassailants.[305] Five years later when, in 1360, Henry of Trastamara\r\ninvaded Castile with the aid of Pedro IV of Aragon, on reaching Najara\r\nhe ordered a massacre of the Jews and, as Ayala states that this was\r\ndone to win popularity, it may be assumed that free license for pillage\r\nwas granted. Apparently stimulated by this example the people of Miranda\r\ndel Ebro, led by Pero Martínez, son of the precentor and by Pero Sánchez\r\nde Bañuelas, fell upon the Jews of their town, but King Pedro hastened\r\nthither and, as a deterrent example, boiled the one leader and roasted\r\nthe other.[306] When at length, in 1366, Henry led into Spain Bertrand\r\nde Guesclin and his hordes of Free Companions, the slaughter of the Jews\r\nwas terrible. Multitudes fled and the French chronicler deplores the\r\nnumber that sought refuge in Paris and preyed upon the people with their\r\nusuries. The aljama of Toledo purchased exemption with a million of\r\nmaravedís, raised in ten days, to pay off the mercenaries but, as the\r\nwhole land lay for a time at the mercy of the reckless bands, slaughter\r\nand pillage were general. Finally the fratricide at Montiel, in 1369,\r\ndeprived the Jews of their protector and left Henry undisputed master of\r\nCastile.[307] What they had to expect from him was indicated by his\r\nlevying, June 6, 1369, within three months of his brother's murder,\r\ntwenty thousand doblas on the Judería of Toledo and authorizing the sale\r\nat auction, not only of the property of the inmates, but of their\r\npersons into slavery, or their imprisonment in chains with starvation or\r\ntorture, until the amount should be raised. It was doubtless to earn\r\npopularity that about the same time he released all Christians and Moors\r\nfrom obligation to pay debts due to Jews, though he was subsequently\r\npersuaded to rescind this decree, which would have destroyed the ability\r\nof the Jews to pay their imposts.[308]\r\n\r\nYet the Jews were indispensable in the conduct of affairs and Henry was\r\nobliged to employ them, like his predecessors. His _contador mayor_ was\r\nYuçaf Pichon, a Jew of the highest consideration, who incurred the\r\nenmity of some of the leaders of his people. They accused him to the\r\nking, who demanded of him forty thousand doblas, which sum he paid\r\nwithin twenty days. With rancor unsatisfied, when Henry died, in 1379,\r\nand his son Juan I came to Burgos to be crowned, they obtained from him\r\nan order to his alguazil to put to death a mischief-making Jew whom they\r\nwould designate. Armed with this they took the alguazil to Pichon's\r\nhouse in the early morning, called him on some pretext from his bed and\r\npointed him out as the designated person to the alguazil, who killed him\r\non the spot. Juan was greatly angered; the alguazil was punished with\r\nthe loss of a hand, the judge of the Judería of Burgos was put to death\r\nand the Jews of Castile were deprived of jurisdiction over the lives of\r\ntheir fellows.[309]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how the legislation of this period was rapidly\r\ntaking a direction unfavorable to the Jews. The accession of the House\r\nof Trastamara had distinctly injured their position, the Church had\r\nfreer scope to excite popular prejudice, while their retention as\r\ntax-collectors and their usurious practices afforded ample material for\r\nthe stimulation of popular vindicativeness. The condition existed for a\r\ncatastrophe, and the man to precipitate it was not lacking. Ferran\r\nMartínez, Archdeacon of Ecija and Official, or judicial representative\r\nof the Archbishop of Seville, Pedro Barroso, was a man of indomitable\r\nfirmness and, though without much learning, was highly esteemed for his\r\nunusual devoutness, his solid virtue and his eminent charity--which\r\nlatter quality he evinced in founding and supporting the hospital of\r\nSanta María in Seville.[310] Unfortunately he was a fanatic and the Jews\r\nwere the object of his remorseless zeal, which his high official\r\nposition gave him ample opportunity of gratifying. In his sermons he\r\ndenounced them savagely and excited popular passion against them,\r\nkeeping them in constant apprehension of an outbreak while, as\r\necclesiastical judge, he extended his jurisdiction illegally over them,\r\nto their frequent damage. In conjunction with other episcopal officials\r\nhe issued letters to the magistrates of the towns ordering them to expel\r\nthe Jews--letters which he sought to enforce by personal visitations.\r\nThe aljama of Seville, the largest and richest in Castile, appealed to\r\nthe king and, little as Henry of Trastamara loved the Jews, the\r\nthreatened loss to his finances led him, in August, 1378, to formally\r\ncommand Martínez to desist from his incendiary course, nor was this the\r\nfirst warning, as is shown by allusions to previous letters of the same\r\nimport. To this Martínez paid no obedience and the aljama had recourse\r\nto Rome, where it procured bulls for its protection, which Martínez\r\ndisregarded as contemptuously as he had the royal mandate. Complaint was\r\nagain made to the throne and Juan I, in 1382, repeated his father's\r\ncommands to no effect, for another royal letter of 1383 accuses Martínez\r\nof saying in his sermons that he knew the king would regard as a service\r\nany assault or slaying of the Jews and that impunity might be relied\r\nupon. For this he was threatened with punishment that would make an\r\nexample of him, but it did not silence him and, in 1388, the frightened\r\naljama summoned him before the alcaldes and had the three royal letters\r\nread, summoning him to obey them. He replied with insults and, a week\r\nlater, put in a formal answer in which he said that he was but obeying\r\nChrist and the laws and that, if he were to execute the laws, he would\r\ntear down the twenty-three synagogues in Seville as they had all been\r\nillegally erected.[311]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MASSACRES OF 1391_]\r\n\r\nThe dean and chapter became alarmed and appealed to the king, but Juan,\r\nin place of enforcing his neglected commands, replied that he would look\r\ninto the matter; the zeal of the archdeacon was holy, but it must not\r\nbe allowed to breed disturbance for, although the Jews were wicked, they\r\nwere under the royal protection. This vacillation encouraged Martínez\r\nwho labored still more strenuously to inflame the people, newly\r\nprejudiced against the Jews by the murder of Yuçaf Pichon, who had been\r\ngreatly beloved by all Seville.[312] No one dared to interfere in their\r\ndefence, but Martínez furnished an opportunity of silencing him by\r\ncalling in question in his sermons the powers of the pope in certain\r\nmatters. He was summoned before an assembly of theologians and doctors,\r\nwhen he was as defiant of the episcopal authority as of the royal,\r\nrendering himself contumacious and suspect of heresy, wherefore on\r\nAugust 2, 1389, Archbishop Barroso suspended him both as to jurisdiction\r\nand preaching until his trial should be concluded.[313] This gave the\r\nJews a breathing-space, but Barroso died, July 7, 1390, followed,\r\nOctober 9, by Juan I. The chapter must have secretly sympathized with\r\nMartínez, for it elected him one of the provisors of the diocese _sede\r\nvacante_, thus clothing him with increased power, and we hear nothing\r\nmore of the trial for heresy.[314]\r\n\r\nJuan had left as his successor Henry III, known as _El Doliente_, or the\r\nInvalid, a child of eleven, and quarrels threatening civil war at once\r\narose over the question of the regency. Martínez now had nothing to fear\r\nand he lost no time in sending, December 8th, to the clergy of the towns\r\nin the diocese, commands under pain of excommunication to tear down\r\nwithin three hours the synagogues of the enemies of God calling\r\nthemselves Jews; the building materials were to be used for the repair\r\nof the churches; if resistance was offered it was to be suppressed by\r\nforce and an interdict be laid on the town until the good work was\r\naccomplished.[315] These orders were not universally obeyed but enough\r\nruin was wrought to lead the frightened aljama of Seville to appeal to\r\nthe regency, threatening to leave the land if they could not be\r\nprotected from Martínez. The answer to this was prompt and decided. On\r\nDecember 22d a missive was addressed to the dean and chapter and was\r\nofficially read to them, January 10, 1391. It held them responsible for\r\nhis acts as they had elected him provisor and had not checked him; he\r\nmust be at once removed from office, be forced to abstain from preaching\r\nand to rebuild the ruined synagogues, in default of which they must make\r\ngood all damages and incur a fine of a thousand gold doblas each with\r\nother arbitrary punishments. Letters of similar import were addressed at\r\nthe same time to Martínez himself. On January 15th the chapter again\r\nassembled and presented its official reply, which deprived Martínez of\r\nthe provisorship, forbade him to preach against the Jews and required\r\nhim within a year to rebuild all synagogues destroyed by his orders.\r\nThen Martínez arose and protested that neither king nor chapter had\r\njurisdiction over him and their sentences were null and void. The\r\nsynagogues had been destroyed by order of Archbishop Barroso--two of\r\nthem in his lifetime--and they had been built illegally without licence.\r\nHis defiant answer concluded with a declaration that he repented of\r\nnothing that he had done.[316]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MASSACRES OF 1391_]\r\n\r\nThe result justified the dauntless reliance of Martínez on the popular\r\npassion which he had been stimulating for so many years. What answer the\r\nregency made to this denial of its jurisdiction the documents fail to\r\ninform us, but no effective steps were taken to restrain him. His\r\npreaching continued as violent as ever and the Seville mob grew more and\r\nmore restless in the prospect of gratifying at once its zeal for the\r\nfaith and its thirst for pillage. In March the aspect of affairs was\r\nmore alarming than ever; the rabble were feeling their way, with\r\noutrages and insults, and the Judería was in hourly danger of being\r\nsacked. Juan Alonso Guzman, Count of Niebla, the most powerful noble of\r\nAndalusia, was adelantado of the province and alcalde mayor of Seville\r\nand his kinsman, Alvar Pérez de Guzman, was alguazil mayor. On March\r\n15th they seized some of the most turbulent of the crowd and proceeded\r\nto scourge two of them but, in place of awing the populace, this led to\r\nopen sedition. The Guzmans were glad to escape with their lives and\r\npopular fury was directed against the Jews, resulting in considerable\r\nbloodshed and plunder, but at length the authorities, aided by the\r\nnobles, prevailed and order was apparently restored. By this time the\r\nagitation was spreading to Córdova, Toledo, Burgos and other places.\r\nEverywhere fanaticism and greed were aroused and the Council of Regency\r\nvainly sent pressing commands to all the large cities, in the hope of\r\naverting the catastrophe. Martínez continued his inflammatory harangues\r\nand sought to turn to the advantage of religion the storm which he had\r\naroused, by procuring a general forcible conversion of the Jews. The\r\nexcitement increased and, on June 9th the tempest broke in a general\r\nrising of the populace against the Judería. Few of its inhabitants\r\nescaped; the number of slain was estimated at four thousand and those of\r\nthe survivors who did not succeed in flying only saved their lives by\r\naccepting baptism. Of the three synagogues two were converted into\r\nchurches for the Christians who settled in the Jewish quarter and the\r\nthird sufficed for the miserable remnant of Israel which slowly gathered\r\ntogether after the storm had passed.[317]\r\n\r\nFrom Seville the flame spread through the kingdoms of Castile from shore\r\nto shore. In the paralysis of public authority, during the summer and\r\nearly autumn of 1391, one city after another followed the example; the\r\nJuderías were sacked, the Jews who would not submit to baptism were\r\nslain and fanaticism and cupidity held their orgies unchecked. The Moors\r\nescaped, for though many wished to include them in the slaughter, they\r\nwere restrained by a wholesome fear of reprisals on the Christian\r\ncaptives in Granada and Africa. The total number of victims was\r\nestimated at fifty thousand, but this is probably an exaggeration. For\r\nthis wholesale butchery and its accompanying rapine there was complete\r\nimmunity. In Castile there was no attempt made to punish the guilty. It\r\nis true that when Henry attained his majority, in 1395, and came to\r\nSeville, he caused Martínez to be arrested, but the penalty inflicted\r\nmust have been trivial, for we are told that it did not affect the high\r\nestimation in which he was held and, on his death in 1404, he bequeathed\r\nvaluable possessions to the Hospital of Santa María. The misfortunes of\r\nthe aljama of Seville were rendered complete when, in January, 1396,\r\nHenry bestowed on two of his favorites all the houses and lands of the\r\nJews there and in May he followed this by forbidding that any of those\r\nconcerned in the murder and pillage should be harassed with punishment\r\nor fines.[318]\r\n\r\nIn Aragon there was a king more ready to meet the crisis and the warning\r\ngiven at Seville was not neglected. Popular excitement was manifesting\r\nitself by assaults, robberies and murders in many places. In the city of\r\nValencia, which had a large Jewish population, the authorities exerted\r\nthemselves to repress these excesses and King Juan I ordered gallows to\r\nbe erected in the streets, while a guard made nightly rounds along the\r\nwalls of the Judería. These precautions and the presence of the Infante\r\nMartin, who was recruiting for an expedition to Sicily, postponed the\r\nexplosion, but it came at last. On Sunday, July 9, 1391, a crowd of\r\nboys, with crosses made of cane and a banner, marched to one of the\r\ngates of the Judería, crying death or baptism for the Jews. By the time\r\nthe gate was closed a portion of the boys were inside and those excluded\r\nshouted that the Jews were killing their comrades. Hard by there was a\r\nrecruiting station with its group of idle vagabonds, who rushed to the\r\nJudería and the report spread through the city that the Jews were\r\nslaying Christians. The magistrates and the Infante hastened to the\r\ngate, but the frightened Jews kept it closed and thus they were\r\nexcluded, while the mob effected entrance from adjoining houses and by\r\nthe old rampart below the bridge. The Judería was sacked and several\r\nhundred Jews were slain before the tumult could be suppressed.\r\nDemonstrations were also made on the Morería, but troops were brought up\r\nand the mob was driven back. Some seventy or eighty arrests were made\r\nand the next day a searching investigation as to the vast amount of\r\nplunder led to the recovery of much of it.[319]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MASSACRES OF 1391_]\r\n\r\nThis added to the agitation which went on increasing. With August 4th\r\ncame the feast of St. Dominic, when the Dominicans were everywhere\r\nconspicuous and active. The next day, as though in concert, the tempest\r\nburst in Toledo and Barcelona--in the former city with fearful massacre\r\nand conflagration. In the latter, despite the warning at Valencia, the\r\nauthorities were unprepared when the mob arose and rushed into the\r\n_call_ or Jewry, slaying without mercy. A general demand for baptism\r\nwent up and, when the civic forces arrived the slaughter was stopped,\r\nbut the plunder continued. Some of the pillagers were arrested, and\r\namong them a few Castilians who, as safe victims, were condemned to\r\ndeath the next day. Under pretext that this was unjust the mob broke\r\ninto the gaol and liberated the prisoners. Then the cry arose to finish\r\nwith the Jews, who had taken refuge in the Castillo Nuevo, which was\r\nsubjected to a regular siege. Ringing the bells brought in crowds of\r\npeasants eager for disorder and spoil. The Baylía was attacked and the\r\nregisters of crown property destroyed, in the hope of evading taxes. On\r\nAugust 8th the Castillo Nuevo was entered and all Jews who would not\r\naccept baptism were put to the sword; the castle was sacked and the\r\npeasants departed laden with booty. The Judería of Barcelona must have\r\nbeen small, for the number of slain was estimated at only three\r\nhundred.[320]\r\n\r\nAt Palma, the capital of Majorca, some three hundred Jews were put to\r\ndeath and the rest escaped only by submitting to baptism. The riots\r\ncontinued for some time and spread to attacks on the public buildings,\r\nuntil the gentlemen of the city armed themselves and, after a stubborn\r\nconflict, suppressed the disturbance. The chief aljamas of the kingdom\r\nwere the appanage of the queen consort and Queen Violante made good her\r\nlosses by levying on the island a fine of 150,000 gold florins. The\r\ngentlemen of Palma remonstrated at the hardship of being punished after\r\nputting down the rioters; she reduced the fine to 120,000, swearing by\r\nthe life of her unborn child that she would have justice. The fine was\r\npaid and soon afterwards she gave birth to a still-born infant.[321]\r\nThus in one place after another--Gerona, Lérida, Saragossa--the\r\nsubterranean flame burst forth, fed by the infernal passions of\r\nfanaticism, greed and hatred. It seems incredible that, with the royal\r\npower resolved to protect its unhappy subjects, these outrages should\r\nhave continued throughout the summer into autumn for, when the local\r\nauthorities were determined to suppress these uprisings, as at Murviedro\r\nand Castellon de la Plana, they were able to do so.[322]\r\n\r\nIf Juan I was unable to prevent the massacres he at least was determined\r\nnot to let them pass unpunished; many executions followed and some\r\ncommutations for money payments were granted.[323] The aljama of\r\nBarcelona had been a source of much profit to the crown and he strove to\r\nre-establish it in new quarters, offering various privileges and\r\nexemptions to attract newcomers. It was crushed however beyond\r\nresuscitation; but few of its members had escaped by hiding; nearly all\r\nhad been slain or baptized and, great as were the franchises offered,\r\nthe memory of the catastrophe seems to have outweighed them. In 1395 the\r\nnew synagogue was converted into a church or monastery of Trinitarian\r\nmonks and the wealthy aljama of Barcelona, with its memories of so many\r\ncenturies, ceased to exist.[324] About the year 1400, the city obtained\r\na privilege which prohibited the formation of a Judería or the residence\r\nof a Jew within its limits. Antipathy to Judaism, as we shall see, was\r\nrapidly increasing and when, in 1425, Alfonso VI confirmed this\r\nprivilege he decreed that all Jews then in the city should depart within\r\nsixty days, under penalty of scourging, and thereafter a stay of fifteen\r\ndays was the utmost limit allowed for temporary residence.[325]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EFFECTS OF THE MASSACRES_]\r\n\r\nIf I have dwelt in what may seem disproportionate length on this _guerra\r\nsacra contra los Judios_, as Villanueva terms these massacres,[326] it\r\nis because they form a turning-point in Spanish history. In the\r\nrelations between the races of the Peninsula the old order of things was\r\nclosed and the new order, which was to prove so benumbing to material\r\nand intellectual development, was about to open. The immediate results\r\nwere not long in becoming apparent. Not only was the prosperity of\r\nCastile and Aragon diminished by the shock to the commerce and industry\r\nso largely in Jewish hands, but the revenues of the crown, the churches\r\nand the nobles, based upon the taxation of the Jews, suffered\r\nenormously. Pious foundations were ruined and bishops had to appeal to\r\nthe king for assistance to maintain the services of their cathedrals. Of\r\nthe Jews who had escaped, the major portion had only done so by\r\nsubmitting to baptism and these were no longer subject to the capitation\r\ntax and special imposts which had furnished the surest part of the\r\nincome of cities, prelates, nobles and sovereigns.[327] Still the\r\nconverted Jews, with their energy and intelligence remained, unfettered\r\nand unhampered in the pursuit of wealth and advancement, which was to\r\nbenefit the community as well as themselves. It was reserved for a\r\nfurther progress in the path now entered to deprive Spain of the\r\nservices of her most industrious children.\r\n\r\nThe most deplorable result of the massacres was that they rendered\r\ninevitable this further progress in the same direction. The Church had\r\nat last succeeded in opening the long-desired chasm between the races.\r\nIt had looked on in silence while the Archdeacon of Ecija was bringing\r\nabout the catastrophe and pope and prelate uttered no word to stay the\r\nlong tragedy of murder and spoliation, which they regarded as an act of\r\nGod to bring the stubborn Hebrew into the fold of Christ. Henceforth the\r\nold friendliness between Jew and Christian was, for the most part, a\r\nthing of the past. Fanaticism and intolerance were fairly aroused, to\r\ngrow stronger with each generation as fresh wrongs and oppression\r\nwidened the abyss between believer and unbeliever and as new preachers\r\nof discord arose to teach the masses that kindness to the Jew was sin\r\nagainst God. Thus gradually the Spanish character changed until it was\r\nprepared to accept the Inquisition, which, by a necessary reaction,\r\nstimulated the development of bigotry until Spain became what we shall\r\nsee it in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\nThat the Archdeacon of Ecija was in reality the remote founder of the\r\nInquisition will become evident when we consider the fortunes of the new\r\nclass created by the massacres of 1391--that of the converted Jews,\r\nknown as New Christians, Marranos or Conversos. Conversion, as we have\r\nseen, was always favored by the laws and the convert was received with a\r\nheartiness of social equality which shows that as yet there was no\r\nantagonism of race but only of religion. The Jew who became a Christian\r\nwas eligible to any position in Church or State or to any matrimonial\r\nalliance for which his abilities or character fitted him, but\r\nconversions had hitherto been too rare and the converts, for the most\r\npart, too humble, for them to play any distinctive part in the social\r\norganization. While the massacres, doubtless, were largely owing to the\r\nattractions of disorder and pillage, the religious element in them was\r\nindicated by the fact that everywhere the Jews were offered the\r\nalternative of baptism and that where willingness was shown to embrace\r\nChristianity, slaughter was at once suspended. The pressure was so\r\nfierce and overwhelming that whole communities were baptized, as we have\r\nseen at Barcelona and Palma. At Valencia, an official report, made on\r\nJuly 14th, five days after the massacre, states that all the Jews,\r\nexcept a few who were in hiding, had already been baptized; they came\r\nforward demanding baptism in such droves that, in all the churches, the\r\nholy chrism was exhausted and the priests knew not where to get more,\r\nbut each morning the _crismera_ would be found miraculously filled, so\r\nthat the supply held out, nor was this by any means the only sign that\r\nthe whole terrible affair was the mysterious work of Providence to\r\neffect so holy an end. The chiefs of the synagogues were included among\r\nthe converts and we can believe the statement, current at the time, that\r\nin Valencia alone the conversions amounted to eleven thousand. Moreover\r\nit was not only in the scenes of massacre that this good work went on.\r\nSo startling and relentless was the slaughter that panic destroyed the\r\nunyielding fortitude so often manifested by the Jews under trial. In\r\nmany places they did not wait for a rising of the Christians but, at the\r\nfirst menace, or even in mere anticipation of danger, they came eagerly\r\nforward and clamored to be admitted into the Church. In Aragon the total\r\nnumber of conversions was reckoned at a hundred thousand and in Castile\r\nas certainly not less and this is probably no great exaggeration.[328]\r\nNeophytes such as these could scarce be expected to prove steadfast in\r\ntheir new faith.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RISE OF THE CONVERSOS_]\r\n\r\nIn this tempest of proselytism the central figure was San Vicente\r\nFerrer, to the fervor of whose preaching posterity attributed the\r\npopular excitement leading to the massacres.[329] This doubtless does\r\nhim an injustice, but the fact that he was on hand in Valencia on the\r\nfatal 9th of July, may perhaps be an indication that the affair was\r\nprearranged. His eloquence was unrivalled; immense crowds assembled to\r\ndrink in his words; no matter what was the native language of the\r\nlistener, we are told that his Catalan was intelligible to Moor, Greek,\r\nGerman, Frenchman, Italian and Hungarian, while the virtue which flowed\r\nfrom him on these occasions healed the infirm and repeatedly restored\r\nthe dead to life.[330] Such was the man who, during the prolonged\r\nmassacres and subsequently, while the terror which they excited\r\ncontinued to dominate the unfortunate race, traversed Spain from end to\r\nend, with restless and indefatigable zeal, preaching, baptizing and\r\nnumbering his converts by the thousand--on a single day in Toledo he is\r\nsaid to have converted no less than four thousand. It is to be hoped\r\nthat, in some cases at least, he may have restrained the murderous mob,\r\nif only by hiding its victims in the baptismal font.\r\n\r\nThe Jews slowly recovered themselves from the terrible shock; they\r\nemerged from their concealment and endeavored, with characteristic\r\ndauntless energy, to rebuild their shattered fortunes. Now, however,\r\nwith diminished numbers and exhausted wealth, they had to face new\r\nenemies. Not only was Christian fanaticism inflamed and growing even\r\nstronger, but the wholesale baptisms had created the new class of\r\nConversos, who were thenceforward to become the deadliest opponents of\r\ntheir former brethren. Many chiefs of the synagogue, learned rabbis and\r\nleaders of their people, had cowered before the storm and had embraced\r\nChristianity. Whether their conversion was sincere or not, they had\r\nbroken with the past and, with the keen intelligence of their race, they\r\ncould see that a new career was open to them in which energy and\r\ncapacity could gratify ambition, unfettered by the limitations\r\nsurrounding them in Judaism. That they should hate, with an exceeding\r\nhatred, those who had proved true to the faith amid tribulation was\r\ninevitable. The renegade is apt to be bitterer against those whom he has\r\nabandoned than is the opponent by birthright and, in such a case as\r\nthis, consciousness of the contempt felt by the steadfast children of\r\nIsrael for the weaklings and worldlings who had apostatized from the\r\nfaith of their fathers gave a keener edge to enmity. From early times\r\nthe hardest blows endured by Judaism had always been dealt by its\r\napostate children, whose training had taught them the weakest points to\r\nassail and whose necessity of self-justification led them to attack\r\nthese mercilessly. In 1085, Rabbi Samuel of Morocco came from Fez and\r\nwas baptized at Toledo, when he wrote a tract[331] to justify himself\r\nwhich had great currency throughout the middle ages. Rabbi Moses, one of\r\nthe most learned Jews of his time, who was converted in 1106, wrote a\r\ndissertation to prove that the Jews had abandoned the laws of Moses\r\nwhile the Christians were fulfilling them.[332] It was Nicholas de\r\nRupella, a converted Jew, who started the long crusade against the\r\nTalmud by pointing out, in 1236, to Gregory IX the blasphemies which it\r\ncontains against the Savior.[333] We have seen the troubles excited in\r\nAragon by the disputatious Converso, Fray Pablo Christía, and he was\r\nfollowed by another Dominican convert, Ramon Martin, in his celebrated\r\n_Pugio Fidei_. In this work, which remained an authority for centuries,\r\nhe piled up endless quotations from Jewish writers to prove that the\r\nrace was properly reduced to servitude and he stimulated the bitterness\r\nof hatred by arguing that Jews esteemed it meritorious to slay and cheat\r\nand despoil Christians.[334]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OPPRESSION OF THE JEWS_]\r\n\r\nThe most prominent among the new Conversos was Selemoh Ha-Levi, a rabbi\r\nwho had been the most intrepid defender of the faith and rights of his\r\nrace. On the eve of the massacres, which perhaps he foresaw, and\r\ninfluenced by an opportune vision of the Virgin, in 1390, he professed\r\nconversion, taking the name of Pablo de Santa María, and was followed by\r\nhis two brothers and five sons, founding a family of commanding\r\ninfluence. After a course in the University of Paris he entered the\r\nChurch, rising to the see of Cartagena and then to that of Burgos, which\r\nhe transmitted to his son Alfonso. At the Córtes of Toledo, in 1406, he\r\nso impressed Henry III that he was appointed tutor and governor of the\r\nInfante Juan II, Mayor of Castile and a member of the Royal Council.\r\nWhen, in the course of the same year, the king died he named Pablo among\r\nthose who were to have the conduct and education of Juan during his\r\nminority; when the regent, Fernando of Antequera, left Castile to assume\r\nthe crown of Aragon, he appointed Pablo to replace him, and the pope\r\nhonored him with the position of legate _a latere_. In 1432, in his\r\neighty-first year, he wrote his _Scrutinium Scripturarum_ against his\r\nformer co-religionists. It is more moderate than is customary in these\r\ncontroversial writings and seems to have been composed rather as a\r\njustification of his own course.[335]\r\n\r\nAnother prominent Converso was the Rabbi Jehoshua Ha-Lorqui, who took\r\nthe name of Gerónimo de Santafé and founded a family almost as powerful\r\nas the Santa Marías. He too showed his zeal in the book named\r\n_Hebræomastix_, in which he exaggerated the errors of the Jews in the\r\nmanner best adapted to excite the execration of Christians. Another\r\nleading Converso family was that of the Caballerías, of which eight\r\nbrothers were baptized and one of them, Bonafos, who called himself\r\nMicer Pedro de la Caballería, wrote, in 1464, the _Celo de Cristo contra\r\nlos Judíos_ in which he treated them with customary obloquy as the\r\nsynagogue of Satan and argues that the hope of Christianity lies in\r\ntheir ruin.[336] In thus stimulating the spirit of persecuting\r\nfanaticism we shall see how these men sowed the wind and reaped the\r\nwhirlwind.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the position of the Jews grew constantly more deplorable.\r\nDecimated and impoverished, they were met by a steadily increasing\r\ntemper of hatred and oppression. The massacres of 1391 had been followed\r\nby a constant stream of emigration to Granada and Portugal, which\r\nthreatened to complete the depopulation of the aljamas and, with the\r\nview of arresting this, Henry III, in 1395, promised them the royal\r\nprotection for the future. The worth of that promise was seen in 1406,\r\nwhen in Córdova the remnant of the Judería was again assailed by the\r\nmob, hundreds of Jews were slain and their houses were sacked and burnt.\r\nIt is true that the king ordered the magistrates to punish the guilty\r\nand expressed his displeasure by a fine of twenty-four thousand doblas\r\non the city, but he had, the year before, in the Córtes of 1405,\r\nassented to a series of laws depriving the Jews at once of property and\r\nof defence, by declaring void all bonds of Christians held by them,\r\nreducing to one-half all debts due to them and requiring a Christian\r\nwitness and the debtor's acknowledgement for the other half, annulling\r\ntheir privileges in the trial of mixed cases and requiring the hateful\r\nred circle to be worn except in travelling, when it could be laid aside\r\nin view of the murders which it invited.[337]\r\n\r\nThis was cruel enough, yet it was but a foretaste of what was in store.\r\nIn 1410, when the Queen-regent Doña Catalina was in Segovia, there was\r\nrevealed a sacrilegious attempt by some Jews to maltreat a consecrated\r\nhost. The story was that the sacristan of San Fagun had pledged it as\r\nsecurity for a loan--the street in which the bargain was made acquiring\r\nin consequence the name of _Calle del Mal Consejo_. The Jews cast it\r\nrepeatedly into a boiling caldron, when it persistently arose and\r\nremained suspended in the air, a miracle which so impressed some of them\r\nthat they were converted and carried the form to the Dominican convent\r\nand related the facts. The wafer was piously administered in communion\r\nto a child who died in three days. Doña Catalina instituted a vigorous\r\ninvestigation which implicated Don Mayr, one of the most prominent Jews\r\nin the kingdom, whose services as physician had prolonged the life of\r\nthe late king. He was subjected to torture sufficient to elicit not only\r\nhis participation in the sacrilege but also that he had poisoned his\r\nroyal master. The convicts were drawn through the streets and quartered,\r\nas were also some others who in revenge had attempted to poison Juan de\r\nTordesillas, the Bishop of Segovia. The Jewish synagogue was converted\r\ninto the church of Corpus Christi and an annual procession still\r\ncommemorates the event. San Vicente Ferrer turned it to good account,\r\nfor we are told that in 1411 he almost destroyed the remnants of Judaism\r\nin the bishopric.[338]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OPPRESSION OF THE JEWS_]\r\n\r\nThe affair made an immense impression especially, it would seem, on San\r\nVicente, convincing him of the advisability of forcing the Jews into the\r\nbosom of the Church by reducing them to despair. At Ayllon, in 1411, he\r\nrepresented to the regents the necessity of further repressive\r\nlegislation and his eloquence was convincing.[339] The _Ordenamiento de\r\nDoña Catalina_, promulgated in 1412 and drawn up by Pablo de Santa María\r\nas Chancellor of Castile, was the result. By this rigorous measure, Jews\r\nand Moors, under savage and ruinous penalties, were not only required to\r\nwear the distinguishing badges, but to dress in coarse stuffs and not to\r\nshave or to cut the hair round. They could not change their abodes and\r\nany nobleman or gentleman receiving them on his lands was heavily fined\r\nand obliged to return them whence they came, while expatriation was\r\nforbidden under pain of slavery. Not only were the higher employments of\r\nfarming the revenues, tax-collecting, and practising as physicians and\r\nsurgeons forbidden, but any position in the households of the great and\r\nnumerous trades, such as those of apothecaries, grocers, farriers,\r\nblacksmiths, peddlers, carpenters, tailors, barbers, and butchers. They\r\ncould not carry arms or hire Christians to work in their houses or on\r\ntheir lands. That they should be forbidden to eat, drink or bathe with\r\nChristians, or be with them in feasts and weddings, or serve as\r\ngod-parents was a matter of course under the canon law, but now even\r\nprivate conversation between the races was prohibited, nor could they\r\nsell provisions to Christians or keep a shop or ordinary for them. It is\r\nperhaps significant that nothing was said about usury. Money-lending was\r\nalmost the only occupation remaining open, while the events of the last\r\ntwenty years had left little capital wherewith to carry it on and the\r\nlaws of 1405 had destroyed all sense of security in making loans. They\r\nwere moreover deprived of the guarantees so long enjoyed and were\r\nsubjected to the exclusive jurisdiction, civil and criminal, of the\r\nChristians.[340] They were thus debarred from the use of their skill and\r\nexperience in the higher pursuits, professional and industrial, and were\r\ncondemned to the lowest and rudest forms of labor; in fine, a wall was\r\nbuilt around them from which their only escape was through the baptismal\r\nfont. Fernando of Antequera carried the law in all its essentials to\r\nAragon and King Duarte adopted it in Portugal, so that it ruled the\r\nwhole Peninsula except the little kingdom of Navarre where Judaism was\r\nalready almost extinct. It is significant that Fernando, in promulgating\r\nit in Majorca, alleged in justification the complaints of the\r\ninquisitors as to the social intercourse between Jews and\r\nChristians.[341]\r\n\r\nWhile San Vicente and Pablo de Santa María were thus engaged in reducing\r\nto despair the Jews of Castile, the other great Converso, Gerónimo de\r\nSantafé, was laboring in a more legitimate way for their conversion in\r\nAragon. He had been appointed physician to the Avignonese pope, Benedict\r\nXIII, who had been obliged to cross the Pyrenees, and who, on November\r\n25, 1412, summoned the aljamas of Aragon to send, in the following\r\nJanuary, their most learned rabbis to San Mateo, near Tortosa, for a\r\ndisputation with Gerónimo on the proposition that the Messiah had come.\r\nFourteen rabbis, selected from the synagogues of all Spain, with Vidal\r\nben Veniste at their head, accepted the challenge. The debate opened,\r\nFebruary 7, 1414, under the presidency of Benedict himself, who warned\r\nthem that the truth of Christianity was not to be discussed but only\r\nsixteen propositions put forward by Gerónimo, thus placing them wholly\r\non the defensive. Despite this disadvantage they held their ground\r\ntenaciously during seventy-nine sessions, prolonged through a term of\r\ntwenty-one months. Gerónimo covered himself with glory by his unrivalled\r\ndialectical subtilty and exhaustless stores of learning and his triumph\r\nwas shown by his producing a division between his opponents.[342]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OPPRESSION OF THE JEWS_]\r\n\r\nDuring this colloquy, in the summer of 1413, some two hundred Jews of\r\nthe synagogues of Saragossa, Calatayud and Alcañiz professed conversion.\r\nIn 1414 there was a still more abundant harvest. A hundred and twenty\r\nfamilies of Calatayud, Daroca, Fraga and Barbastro presented themselves\r\nfor baptism and these were followed by the whole aljamas of Alcañiz,\r\nCaspe, Maella, Lérida, Tamarit and Alcolea, amounting to about\r\nthirty-five hundred souls. The repressive legislation was accomplishing\r\nits object and hopes were entertained that, with the aid of the inspired\r\nteaching of San Vicente, Judaism would become extinct throughout\r\nSpain.[343] To stimulate the movement by an increase of severity towards\r\nthe recalcitrant, Benedict issued his constitution _Etsi doctoribus\r\ngentium_, in which he virtually embodied the Ordenamiento de Doña\r\nCatalina, thus giving to its system of terrible repression the sanction\r\nof Church as well as of State. He further forbade the possession of the\r\nTalmud or of any books contrary to the Christian faith, ordering the\r\nbishops and inquisitors to make semi-annual inquests of the aljamas and\r\nto proceed against all found in possession of such books. No Jew should\r\neven bind a book in which the name of Christ or the Virgin appeared.\r\nPrinces were exhorted to grant them no favors or privileges and the\r\nfaithful at large were commanded not to rent or sell houses to them or\r\nto hold companionship or conversation with them. Moreover they were\r\nprohibited to exercise usury and thrice a year they were to be preached\r\nto and warned to abandon their errors. The bishops in general were\r\nordered to see to the strict enforcement of all these provisions and the\r\nexecution of the bull was specially confided to Gonzalo, Bishop of\r\nSigüenza, son of the great Converso, Pablo de Santa María. As the\r\nutterance of the Anti-pope Benedict, this searching and cruel\r\nlegislation, designed to reduce the Jews to the lowest depths of poverty\r\nand despair, was current only in the lands of his obedience, but when\r\nhis triumphant rival, Martin V, confirmed the charge confided to the\r\nBishop of Sigüenza he accepted and ratified the act of Benedict.[344]\r\nNay more; in 1434, Alfonso de Santa María, Bishop of Burgos, another son\r\nof the Converso Pablo, when a delegate to the council of Basle, procured\r\nthe passage of a decree in the same sense.[345] The quarrel of the\r\ncouncil with the papacy, it is true, deprived its utterance of\r\noecumenic authority, but this deficiency was supplied when, in 1442,\r\nEugenius IV issued a bull which was virtually a repetition of the law of\r\nDoña Catalina and of the constitution of Benedict XIII, while this was\r\nfollowed, in 1447, by an even more rigorous one of Nicholas V.[346] Thus\r\nall factions of the Church, however much they might wrangle on other\r\npoints, cheerfully united in rendering the life of the Jew as miserable\r\nas possible and in forbidding princes to show him favor. This was\r\nsymbolized when, in 1418, the legate of Martin V was solemnly received\r\nin Gerona and the populace, with inerring instinct, celebrated the\r\nclosing of the great Schism and the reunion of the Church by playfully\r\nsacking the Judería, though the royal officials, blind to the piety of\r\nthe demonstration, severely punished the perpetrators.[347]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of this policy corresponded to the intentions of\r\nits authors, though its ultimate results can scarce have been foreseen.\r\nThe Jews were humiliated and impoverished. Despite their losses by\r\nmassacre and conversion, they still formed an important portion of the\r\npopulation, with training and aptitudes to render service to the State\r\nbut, debarred from the pursuits for which they had been fitted, they\r\nwere crippled both for their own recuperation and for the benefit of the\r\npublic. The economic effect was intensified by the inclusion of the\r\nMudéjares in the repressive legislation; commerce and manufactures\r\ndecayed and many products which Spain had hitherto exported she was now\r\nobliged to import at advanced prices.[348]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VICISSITUDES_]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the Conversos saw opened to them a career fitted to\r\nstimulate and satisfy ambition. Confident in their powers, with\r\nintellectual training superior to that of the Christians, they aspired\r\nto the highest places in the courts, in the universities, in the Church\r\nand in the State. Wealth and power rendered them eligible suitors and\r\nthey entered into matrimonial alliances with the noblest houses in the\r\nland, many of which had been impoverished by the shrinkage of the\r\nrevenues derived from their Jewish subjects. Alfonso de Santa María, in\r\nprocuring the decree of Basle, was careful to insert in it a\r\nrecommendation of marriage between converts and Christians as the surest\r\nmeans of preserving the purity of the faith, and the advice was\r\nextensively followed. Thus the time soon came when there were few of the\r\nancient nobility of Spain who were not connected, closely or remotely,\r\nwith the Jew. We hear of marriages with Lunas, Mendozas, Villahermosas\r\nand others of the proudest houses.[349] As early as 1449 a petition to\r\nLope de Barrientos, Bishop of Cuenca, by the Conversos of Toledo,\r\nenumerates all the noblest families of Spain as being of Jewish blood\r\nand among others the Henríquez, from whom the future Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic descended, through his mother Juana Henríquez.[350] It was the\r\nsame in the Church, where we have seen the rank attained by the Santa\r\nMarías. Juan de Torquemada, Cardinal of San Sisto, was of Jewish descent\r\nand so, of course, was his nephew, the first inquisitor-general,[351] as\r\nwas likewise Diego Deza, the second inquisitor-general, as well as\r\nHernando de Talavera, Archbishop of Granada. It would be easy to\r\nmultiply examples, for in every career the vigor and keenness of the\r\nJews made them conspicuous and, in embracing Christianity, they seemed\r\nto be opening a new avenue for the development of the race in which it\r\nwould become dominant over the Old Christians; in fact, an Italian\r\nnearly contemporary describes them as virtually ruling Spain, while\r\nsecretly perverting the faith by their covert adherance to Judaism.[352]\r\nThis triumph however was short-lived. Their success showed that thus far\r\nthere had been no antagonism of race but only of religion. This speedily\r\nchanged; the hatred and contempt which, as apostates, they lavished on\r\nthe faithful sons of Israel reacted on themselves. It was impossible to\r\nstimulate popular abhorrence of the Jew without at the same time\r\nstimulating the envy and jealousy excited by the ostentation and\r\narrogance of the New Christians. What was the use of humiliating and\r\nexterminating the Jew if these upstarts were not only to take his place\r\nin grinding the people as tax-gatherers but were to bear rule in court\r\nand camp and church?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the remnant of the Jews were slowly but indomitably recovering\r\ntheir position. It was much easier to enact the _Ordenamiento de Doña\r\nCatalina_ than to enforce it and, like much previous legislation, it was\r\ngrowing obsolete in many respects. In the early days of Juan II, Abrahem\r\nBenaviste was virtually finance minister and, when the Infante Henry of\r\nAragon seized the king at Tordesillas and carried him off, he justified\r\nthe act by saying that it was because the government was in the hands of\r\nAbrahem.[353] In fact there are indications of a reaction in which the\r\nJews were used as a counterpoise to the menacing growth of Converso\r\ninfluence. When, in 1442, the cruel bull of Eugenius IV was received,\r\nalthough it scarce contained more than the laws of 1412 and the bull of\r\nBenedict XIII, Alvaro de Luna, the all-powerful favorite, not only\r\nrefused to obey it but proceeded to give legal sanction to the neglect\r\ninto which those statutes had fallen. He induced his master to issue the\r\nPragmática of Arévalo, April 6, 1443, condemning the refusal of many\r\npersons to buy or sell with Jews and Moors or to labor for them in the\r\nfields, under color of a bull of Eugenius IV, published at Toledo during\r\nhis absence. Punishment is threatened for these audacities, for the bull\r\nand the laws provide that Jews and Moors and Christians shall dwell\r\ntogether in harmony and no one is to injure or slay them. It was not\r\nintended to prevent Jews and Moors and Christians from dealing\r\ntogether, nor that the former should not follow industries base and\r\nservile, such as all manner of mechanical trades, and Christians can\r\nserve them for proper wages and guard their flocks and labor for them in\r\nthe fields, and they can prescribe for Christians if the medicines are\r\ncompounded by Christians.[354]\r\n\r\nThus a revulsion had taken place in favor of the proscribed race which\r\nthreatened to undo the work of Vicente Ferrer and the Conversos. It was\r\nin vain that, in 1451, Nicholas V issued another bull repeating and\r\nconfirming that of Eugenius IV.[355] It received no attention and, under\r\nthe protection of Alvaro de Luna, the Jews made good use of the\r\nbreathing-space to reconstruct their shattered industries and to\r\ndemonstrate their utility to the State. The conspiracy which sent Alvaro\r\nto the block, in 1453, was a severe blow but, on the accession of Henry\r\nIV, in 1454, they secured the good-will of his favorites and even\r\nprocured the restoration of some old privileges, the most important of\r\nwhich was the permission to have their own judges. One element in this\r\nwas the influence enjoyed by the royal physician Jacob Aben-Nuñez on\r\nwhom was conferred the office of Rabb Mayor.[356] In the virtual anarchy\r\nof the period, however, when every noble was a law unto himself, it is\r\nimpossible to say how far royal decrees were effective, or to postulate\r\nany general conditions. In 1458, the Constable Velasco orders his\r\nvassals of the town of Haro to observe the law forbidding Christians to\r\nlabor for Jews and Moors, but he makes the wise exception that they may\r\ndo so when they can find no other work wherewith to support themselves.\r\nEven under these conditions the superior energy of the non-Christian\r\nraces was rapidly acquiring for them the most productive lands, if we\r\nmay trust a decree of the town of Haro, in 1453, forbidding Christians\r\nto sell their estates to Moors and Jews, for if this were not stopped\r\nthe Christians would have no ground to cultivate, as the Moors already\r\nheld all the best of the irrigated lands.[357]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VICISSITUDES_]\r\n\r\nThe nobles had seen the disadvantage of the sternly oppressive laws and\r\ndisregarded them to their own great benefit, thus raising the envy of\r\nthe districts obliged to observe them, for the Córtes of 1462 petitioned\r\nHenry to restore liberty of trade between Christian and Jew, alleging\r\nthe inconvenience caused by the restriction and the depopulation of the\r\ncrown lands for, as trade was permitted in the lands of the nobles, the\r\nJews were concentrating there. When further the Córtes asked that Jews\r\nshould be permitted to return with their property and trades to the\r\ncities in the royal domains from which they had been expelled, it\r\nindicates that popular aversion was becoming directed to the Conversos\r\nrather than to the Jews.[358] It may be questioned whether it was to\r\npreserve the advantage here indicated or to gain popular favor, that the\r\nrevolted nobles, in 1460, demanded of Henry that he should banish from\r\nhis kingdoms all Moors and Jews who contaminated religion and corrupted\r\nmorals and that, when they deposed him, in 1465, at Avila and elevated\r\nto the throne the child Alfonso, the _Concordia Compromisoria_ which\r\nthey dictated, annulled the Pragmática of Arévalo and restored to vigor\r\nthe laws of 1412 and the bull of Benedict XIII. This frightened the\r\nJews, who offered to Henry an immense sum for Gibraltar, where they\r\nproposed to establish a city of refuge, but he refused.[359]\r\n\r\nThe fright was superfluous for, in the turbulence of the time, the\r\nrepressive legislation was speedily becoming obsolete. When the\r\nreforming Council of Aranda, in 1473, made but a single reference to\r\nJews and Moors and this was merely to forbid them to pursue their\r\nindustries publicly on Sundays and feast days, with a threat against the\r\njudges who, through bribery, permitted this desecration, it is fair to\r\nconclude that the law of 1412, if observed at all, was enforced only in\r\nscattered localities.[360] That the restrictions on commercial activity\r\nwere obsolete is manifest from a complaint, in 1475, to the sovereigns,\r\nfrom the Jews of Medina del Pomar, setting forth that they had been\r\naccustomed to purchase in Bilbao, from foreign traders, cloths and other\r\nmerchandise which they carried through the kingdom for sale, until\r\nrecently the port had restricted all dealings with foreigners to the\r\nresident Jews, whereupon Ferdinand and Isabella ordered these\r\nregulations rescinded unless the authorities could show good reasons\r\nwithin fifteen days.[361]\r\n\r\nWith the settlement of affairs under Ferdinand and Isabella the position\r\nof the Jews grew distinctly worse. Although Don Abraham Senior, one of\r\nIsabella's most trusted counsellors, was a Jew, her piety led her to\r\nrevive and carry out the repressive policy of San Vicente Ferrer and, in\r\ncodifying the royal edicts in the _Ordenanzas Reales_, confirmed by the\r\nCórtes of Toledo in 1480, all the savage legislation of 1412 was\r\nre-enacted, except that relating to mechanical trades, and the vigor of\r\nthe government gave assurance that the laws would be enforced, as we\r\nhave seen in the matter of the separation of the Juderías.[362]\r\nFerdinand's assent to this shows that he adopted the policy and, in his\r\nown dominions, by an edict of March 6, 1482, he withdrew all licenses to\r\nJews to lay aside the dangerous badge when travelling, and he further\r\nprohibited the issuing of such licenses under penalty of a thousand\r\nflorins. Another edict of December 15, 1484, recites that at Cella, a\r\nvillage near Teruel, some Jews had recently taken temporary residence;\r\nas there is no Judería, in order to avoid danger to souls, he orders\r\nthem driven out and that none be allowed to remain more than twenty-four\r\nhours under pain of a hundred florins and a hundred lashes.[363]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DECLINE OF JUDAISM_]\r\n\r\nThis recrudescence of oppression probably had an influence on the\r\npeople, for there came a revulsion of feeling adverse to the proscribed\r\nrace, inflamed by the ceaseless labors of the frailes whose denunciatory\r\neloquence knew no cessation. Under these circumstances the Jews and\r\nMoors seem to have had recourse to the Roman curia, always ready to\r\nspeculate by selling privileges, whether it had power to grant them or\r\nnot, and then to withdraw them for a consideration. We shall have ample\r\noccasion to see hereafter prolonged transactions of the kind arising\r\nfrom the operation of the Inquisition; those with the Jews at this time\r\nseem to have been closed by a _motu proprio_ of May 31, 1484, doubtless\r\nprocured from Sixtus IV by pressure from the sovereigns, in which the\r\npope expresses his displeasure at learning that in Spain, especially in\r\nAndalusia, Christians, Moors and Jews dwell together; that there is no\r\ndistinction of vestments, that the Christians act as servants and\r\nnurses, the Moors and Jews as physicians, apothecaries, farmers of\r\necclesiastical revenues etc., pretending that they hold papal privileges\r\nto that effect. Any such privileges he withdraws and he orders all\r\nofficials, secular and ecclesiastical, to enforce strictly the canonical\r\ndecrees respecting the proscribed races.[364] Under these impulses the\r\nmunicipalities, which, in 1462, had petitioned to have the prescriptive\r\nlaws repealed now enforced them with renewed vigor and even exceeded\r\nthem, as at Balmaseda, where the Jews were ordered to depart. They\r\nappealed to the throne, representing that they lived in daily fear for\r\nlife and property and begged the royal protection, which was duly\r\ngranted.[365]\r\n\r\nSubjected to these perpetual and harassing vicissitudes, the Jews had\r\ngreatly declined both in numbers and wealth. An assessment of the\r\npoll-tax, made in 1474, shows that in the dominions of Castile there\r\nwere only about twelve thousand families left, or from fifty to sixty\r\nthousand souls, although there were still two hundred and sixteen\r\nseparate aljamas. Their weakness and poverty are indicated by the fact\r\nthat such communities as those of Seville, Toledo, Córdova, Burgos,\r\netc., paid much less than inconspicuous places prior to 1391. The aljama\r\nof Ciudad-Real, which had paid, in 1290, a tax of 26,486 maravedís, had\r\ndisappeared; the only one left in La Mancha was Almagro, assessed at 800\r\nmaravedís.[366] The work of Martínez and San Vicente Ferrer was\r\naccomplishing itself. Popular abhorrence had grown, while the importance\r\nof the Jews as a source of public revenue had fatally diminished. The\r\nend was evidently approaching, but a consideration of its horrors must\r\nbe postponed while we glance at the condition of the renegades who had\r\nsought shelter from the storm by adopting the faith of the oppressor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Conversos, in steadily increasing numbers, had successfully worked\r\nout their destiny, accumulating honors, wealth and popular hatred. In\r\nboth Castile and Aragon they filled lucrative and influential positions\r\nin the public service and their preponderance in Church and State was\r\nconstantly becoming more marked. In Catalonia, however, they were\r\nregarded with contempt and, though the boast that Catalan blood was\r\nnever polluted by inter-mixture is exaggerated, it is not wholly without\r\nfoundation. The same is true of Valencia, where intermarriage only\r\noccurred among the rural population. Throughout Spain, moreover, the\r\nfarming of all the more important sources of revenue passed into their\r\nhands and thus they inherited the odium as well as the profits of the\r\nJews.[367]\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the end was seen at Toledo where, in 1449, Alvaro de\r\nLuna made a demand on the city for a million maravedís for the defence\r\nof the frontier and it was refused. He ordered the tax-gatherers to\r\ncollect it. They were Conversos and when they made the attempt the\r\ncitizens arose and sacked and burnt not only their houses but those of\r\nthe Conversos in general. The latter organized in self-defence and\r\nendeavored to suppress the disturbance but were defeated, when those who\r\nwere wealthy were tortured and immense booty was obtained. In vain Juan\r\nII sought to punish the city; the triumphant citizens, with the\r\nmagistrates at their head, organized a court in which the question was\r\nargued whether the Conversos could hold any public office. In spite of\r\nthe evident illegality of this and of active opposition led by the\r\nfamous Lope de Barrientos, Bishop of Cuenca, it was decided against the\r\nConversos in a quasi-judicial sentence, known as the\r\n_Sentencia-Estatuto_ which, in the bitterness of its language, reveals\r\nthe extreme tension existing between the Old and New Christians. The\r\nConversos were stigmatized as more than suspect in the faith and as in\r\nreality Jews; they were declared incapable of holding office and of\r\nbearing witness against Old Christians and those who held positions were\r\nejected.[368] The disturbances spread to Ciudad-Real, where the\r\nprincipal offices were held by Conversos. The Order of Calatrava, which\r\nhad long endeavored to get possession of the city, espoused the side of\r\nthe Old Christians; there was considerable fighting in the streets and\r\nfor five days the quarter occupied by the Conversos was exposed to\r\npillage.[369] Thus the hatred which of old had been merely a matter of\r\nreligion had become a matter of race. The one could be conjured away by\r\nbaptism; the other was indelible and the change was of the most serious\r\nimport, exercising for centuries its sinister influence on the fate of\r\nthe Peninsula.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PERSECUTION OF CONVERSOS_]\r\n\r\nThe Sentencia-Estatuto threatened to introduce a new principle into\r\npublic and canon law, both of which had always upheld the brotherhood of\r\nChristians and had encouraged conversions by prescribing the utmost\r\nfavor for converts. Nicholas V was appealed to and responded, September\r\n24, 1449, with a bull declaring that all the faithful are one; that the\r\nlaws of Alfonso X and his successors, admitting converts to all the\r\nprivileges of Christians, were to be enforced and he commissioned the\r\nArchbishops of Toledo and Seville, the Bishops of Palencia, Avila and\r\nCórdova, and the Abbot of San Fagun to excommunicate all who sought to\r\ninvalidate them.[370] More than this seems to have been needed and, in\r\n1450, he formally excommunicated Pedro Sarmiento and his accomplices as\r\nthe authors of the Sentencia-Estatuto and again, in 1451, he repeated\r\nhis bull of 1449. Finally, in the same year the synods of Vitoria and\r\nAlcalá condemned it and Alfonso de Montalvo, the foremost jurist of the\r\ntime, pronounced it to be illegal.[371] It never, in fact, was of\r\nbinding force, but the effort made to set it aside shows how dangerous a\r\nmenace it was and how it expressed a widespread public opinion. It was\r\nthe first fitful gust of the tornado.\r\n\r\nToledo remained the hot-bed of disturbance. In 1461 the martial\r\nArchbishop, Alonso Carrillo commissioned the learned Alonso de Oropesa,\r\nGeneral of the Geronimites to investigate the cause of dissension. He\r\ndid so and reported that there were faults on both sides and, at the\r\nrequest of the archbishop, he proceeded to write his _Lumen ad\r\nRevelationem Gentium_ to prove the unity of the faithful, but, while he\r\nwas engaged in this pious labor the inextinguishable feud broke out\r\nafresh.[372] Any chance disturbance might bring this about and the\r\nopportunity was furnished in 1467, when the canons, who enjoyed a\r\nrevenue based on the bread of the town of Maqueda, farmed it out to a\r\nJew. Alvaro Gómez, an alcalde mayor, was lord of Maqueda; his alcaide\r\nbeat the Jew and seized the bread for the use of the castle; the canons\r\npromptly imprisoned the alcaide and summoned Gómez to answer. When he\r\ncame the quarrel grew bitterer; the Count of Cifuentes, leader of one of\r\nthe factions of the city and protector of the Conversos, espoused the\r\ncause of Gómez, while Fernando de la Torre, a leader of the Conversos,\r\nhoping to revenge the defeat of 1449, boasted that he had at command\r\nfour thousand well-armed fighting men, being six times more than the\r\nOld Christians could muster. Matters were ripe for an explosion and, on\r\nJuly 21st, at a conference held in the cathedral, the followers of the\r\ntwo parties taunted each other beyond endurance; swords were drawn and\r\nblood polluted the sanctuary, though only one man was slain. The canons\r\nproceeded to fortify and garrison the cathedral, which was attacked the\r\nnext day. The clergy, galled by the fire of the assailants, to create a\r\ndiversion, started a conflagration in the calle de la Chapineria, which\r\nspread until eight streets were destroyed--the richest in Toledo,\r\ncrowded with shops full of costly merchandise. The device was\r\nsuccessful; the Conversos were disheartened and lost ground till, on the\r\n29th, Cifuentes and Gómez fled, while Fernando de la Torre and his\r\nbrother Alvaro were captured and hanged. The triumphant faction removed\r\nfrom office all their opponents and revived with additional rigor the\r\nSentencia-Estatuto. Toledo at the time belonged to the party of the\r\npretender Alfonso XII but, when the citizens sent to him to confirm what\r\nthey had done, he refused and the city soon afterwards transferred its\r\nallegiance to Henry IV.[373] It is quite probable that, in reward for\r\nthis, he confirmed the Sentencia-Estatuto for when, about the same time,\r\nCiudad-Real revolted from Alfonso and adhered to Henry, he granted, July\r\n14, 1468, to that city that thenceforward no Converse should hold\r\nmunicipal office.[374] In the all-pervading lawlessness such\r\ndisturbances as those of Toledo met with neither repression nor\r\npunishment. In 1470 Valladolid saw a similar tumult, in which the Old\r\nChristians and Conversos flew to arms and struggled for mastery. The\r\nformer sent for Ferdinand and Isabella who came, but the majority of the\r\ncitizens preferred Henry IV and the royal pair were glad to escape.[375]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PERSECUTION OF CONVERSOS_]\r\n\r\nEverywhere the hatred between the Old Christians and the New was\r\nmanifesting itself in this deplorable fashion. In Córdova we are told\r\nthat the Conversos were very rich and had bought not only the offices\r\nbut the protection of Alonso de Aguilar, whose power and high reputation\r\ncommanded universal respect, while the Old Christians ranged themselves\r\nunder the Counts of Cabra and the Bishop, Pedro de Córdova y Solier.\r\nOnly a spark was needed to produce an explosion and an accident during\r\na, procession, March 14, 1473, furnished the occasion. With shouts of\r\n_viva la fe de Dios_ the mob arose and pillage, murder and fire were let\r\nloose upon the city. Alonso and his brother Gonsalvo--the future Great\r\nCaptain--quelled the riot at the cost of no little bloodshed, but it\r\nburst forth again a few days later and, after a combat lasting\r\nforty-eight hours the Aguilars were forced to take refuge in the alcázar\r\ncarrying with them such Conversos and Jews as they could. Then followed\r\na general sack in which every kind of outrage and cruelty was\r\nperpetrated, until the fury of the mob was exhausted by the lack of\r\nvictims. Finally Alonso came to terms with the city authorities, who\r\nbanished the Conversos for ever and such poor wretches as had escaped\r\ntorch and dagger were thrust forth to be robbed and murdered with\r\nimpunity on the highways.[376]\r\n\r\nLaborers from the country, who chanced to be in Córdova, carried the\r\nwelcome news to neighboring places and the flame passed swiftly through\r\nAndalusia from town to town. Baena was kept quiet by the Count of Cabra,\r\nPalma by Luis Portocarrero, Ecija by Fadrique Manrique and Seville and\r\nJerez by Juan de Guzman and Rodrigo Ponce de Leon, but elsewhere the\r\nhavoc was terrible. At Jaen, the Constable of Castile, Miguel Luis de\r\nIranzo, was treacherously murdered while kneeling before the altar; his\r\nwife, Teresa de Torres, was barely able to escape, with her children, to\r\nthe alcázar, and the Conversos were plundered and dispatched. Only at\r\nAlmodovar del Campo do we hear of any justice executed on the assassins,\r\nfor there Rodrigo Giron, Master of Calatrava, hanged some of the most\r\nculpable. The king, we are told, when the news was brought to him,\r\ngrieved much, but inflicted no punishment.[377]\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Ferdinand and Isabella, in 1474, a Converso of\r\nCórdova, Anton de Montoro, addressed to them a poem in which he gives a\r\nterrible picture of the murders committed with impunity on his brethren,\r\nwhose purity of faith he asserts. Fire and sword had just ravaged the\r\naljama of Carmona and fresh disasters were threatening at Seville and\r\nCórdova.[378] Dominicans and Franciscans were thundering from the\r\npulpits and were calling on the faithful to purify the land from the\r\npollution of Judaism, secret and open. It was commonly asserted and\r\nbelieved that the Christianity of the Conversos was fictitious, and\r\nfanaticism joined with envy and greed in stimulating the massacres that\r\nhad become so frequent. The means adopted to win over the Jewish\r\nconverts had not been so gentle as to encourage confidence in the\r\nsincerity of their professions and, rightly or wrongly, they were almost\r\nuniversally suspected. The energy with which the new sovereigns enforced\r\nrespect for the laws speedily put an end to the hideous excesses of the\r\nmob, for we hear of no further massacres, but the abhorrence entertained\r\nfor the successful renegades, whose wealth and power were regarded as\r\nobtained by false profession of belief in Christ, was still wide-spread,\r\nthough its more violent manifestations were restrained. Wise\r\nforbearance, combined with vigorous maintenance of order, would in time\r\nhave brought about reconciliation, to the infinite benefit of Spain, but\r\nat a time when heresy was regarded as the greatest of crimes and unity\r\nof faith as the supreme object of statesmanship, wise forbearance and\r\ntoleration were impossible. After suppressing turbulence the sovereigns\r\ntherefore felt that there was still a duty before them to vindicate the\r\nfaith. Thus, after long hesitation, their policy with regard to the\r\nConversos was embodied in the Inquisition, introduced towards the end of\r\n1480. The Jewish question required different treatment and it was\r\nsolved, once for all, in most decisive fashion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EXPULSION OF JEWS CONSIDERED_]\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition had no jurisdiction over the Jew, unless he rendered\r\nhimself amenable to it by some offence against the faith. He was not\r\nbaptized; he was not a member of the Church and therefore was incapable\r\nof heresy, which was the object of inquisitional functions. He might,\r\nhowever, render himself subject to it by proselytism, by seducing\r\nChristians to embrace his errors, and this was constantly alleged\r\nagainst Jews, although their history shows that, unlike the other great\r\nreligions, Judaism has ever been a national faith with no desire to\r\nspread beyond the boundaries of the race. As the chosen people, Israel\r\nhas never sought to share its God with the Gentiles. There was more\r\nfoundation, probably, in the accusation that the secret perversity of\r\nthe Conversos was encouraged by those who had remained steadfast in the\r\nfaith, that circumcisions were secretly performed and that contributions\r\nto the synagogues were welcomed.\r\n\r\nWhile the object of the Inquisition was to secure the unity of faith,\r\nits founding destroyed the hope that ultimately the Jews would all be\r\ngathered into the fold of Christ. This had been the justification of the\r\ninhuman laws designed to render existence outside of the Church so\r\nintolerable that baptism would be sought as a relief from endless\r\ninjustice, but the awful spectacle of the autos de fe and the miseries\r\nattendant on wholesale confiscations led the Jew to cherish more\r\nresolutely than ever the ancestral faith which served him as shield from\r\nthe terrors of the Holy Office and the dreadful fate ever impending over\r\nthe Conversos. His conversion could no longer be hoped for and, so long\r\nas he remained in Spain, the faithful would be scandalized by his\r\npresence and the converts would be exposed to the contamination of his\r\nsociety. The only alternative was his removal.\r\n\r\nIsabella tried a partial experiment of this kind in 1480, apparently to\r\nsupplement the Inquisition, founded about the same time. Andalusia was\r\nthe province where the Jews were most numerous and she commenced by\r\nordering the expulsion from there of all who would not accept\r\nChristianity and threatening with death any new settlers.[379] We have\r\nno details as to this measure and only know that it was several times\r\npostponed and that it was apparently abandoned.[380] A bull of Sixtus\r\nIV, in 1484, shows us that Jews were still dwelling there undisturbed\r\nand, when the final expulsion took place in 1492, Bernaldez informs us\r\nthat from Andalusia eight thousand households embarked at Cadiz, besides\r\nmany at Cartagena and the ports of Aragon.[381]\r\n\r\nThat there was vacillation is highly probable, for policy and fanaticism\r\nwere irreconcilable. The war with Granada was calling for large\r\nexpenditures, to which the Jews were most useful contributors and the\r\nfinances were in the hands of two leading Jews, Abraham Senior and Isaac\r\nAbravanel, to whose skilful management its ultimate success was largely\r\ndue. It may be that the threatened expulsion was rather a financial than\r\na religious measure, adopted with a view of selling suspensions and\r\nexemptions, and this may also perhaps explain a similar course adopted\r\nby Ferdinand when, in May, 1486, he ordered the inquisitors of Aragon to\r\nbanish all Jews of Saragossa from the archbishopric of Saragossa and the\r\nbishopric of Albarracin, in the same way as they had been banished from\r\nthe sees of Seville, Córdova and Jaen.[382] The sovereigns knew when to\r\nbe tolerant and when to give full rein to fanaticism, as was evinced in\r\ntheir treatment of renegades and Conversos at the capture of Málaga as\r\ncontrasted with the liberal terms offered in the capitulations of\r\nAlmería and Granada. They were prepared to listen to the counsel of\r\nthose who opposed all interference with the Jewish population, in whose\r\nfavor there were powerful influences at work. Isabella apparently\r\nhesitated long between statesmanship and her conceptions of duty, while\r\nTorquemada never ceased to urge upon her the service to be rendered to\r\nChrist by clearing her dominions of the descendants of his\r\ncrucifiers.[383]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _STIMULATION OF PREJUDICE_]\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of effort to inflame public opinion and to excite\r\nstill further the hostility so long and so carefully cultivated. A story\r\nhad wide circulation that Maestre Ribas Altas, the royal physician, wore\r\na golden ball attached to a cord around his neck; that Prince Juan,\r\nonly son of the sovereigns, begged it of him and managed to open it,\r\nwhen he found inside a parchment on which was painted a crucifix with\r\nthe physician in an indecent attitude; that he was so affected that he\r\nfell sick and, after much persuasion, revealed the cause, adding that he\r\nwould not recover until the Jew was burnt, which was accordingly done\r\nand Ferdinand consented to the expulsion of the accursed sect.[384] Then\r\nwe are told that, on Good Friday, 1488, some Jews, to avenge an insult,\r\nstoned a rude cross which stood on the hill of Gano near Casar de\r\nPalomero; they were observed and denounced, when the Duke of Alba burnt\r\nthe rabbi and several of the culprits; the cross was repaired and\r\ncarried in solemn procession to the parish church, where it still\r\nremains an object of popular veneration.[385] It is to this period also\r\nthat we may presumably refer the fabrication of a correspondence,\r\ndiscovered fifty years later among the archives of Toledo by Archbishop\r\nSiliceo, between Chamorro, Prince of the Jews of Spain and Uliff, Prince\r\nof those of Constantinople, in which the latter, replying to a request\r\nfor counsel, tells the former \"as the king takes your property, make\r\nyour sons merchants that they may take the property of the Christians;\r\nas he takes your lives, make your sons physicians and apothecaries, that\r\nthey may take Christian lives; as he destroys your synagogues, make your\r\nsons ecclesiastics, that they may destroy the churches; as he vexes you\r\nin other ways, make your sons officials, that they may reduce the\r\nChristians to subjection and take revenge.\"[386]\r\n\r\nThe most effective device, however, was a cruel one, carried out by\r\nTorquemada unshrinkingly to the end. In June, 1490, a Converso named\r\nBenito García, on his return from a pilgrimage to Compostella, was\r\narrested at Astorga on the charge of having a consecrated wafer in his\r\nknapsack. The episcopal vicar, Dr. Pedro de Villada, tortured him\r\nrepeatedly till he obtained a confession implicating five other\r\nConversos and six Jews in a plot to effect a conjuration with a human\r\nheart and a consecrated host, whereby to cause the madness and death of\r\nall Christians, the destruction of Christianity and the triumph of\r\nJudaism. Three of the implicated Jews were dead, but the rest of those\r\nnamed were promptly arrested and the trial was carried on by the\r\nInquisition. After another year spent in torturing the accused, there\r\nemerged the story of the crucifixion at La Guardia of a Christian child,\r\nwhose heart was cut out for the purpose of the conjuration. The whole\r\ntissue was so evidently the creation of the torture-chamber that it was\r\nimpossible to reconcile the discrepancies in the confessions of the\r\naccused, although the very unusual recourse of confronting them was\r\ntried several times; no child had anywhere been missed and no remains\r\nwere found on the spot where it was said to have been buried. The\r\ninquisitors finally abandoned the attempt to frame a consistent\r\nnarrative and, on November 16, 1491, the accused were executed at Avila;\r\nthe three deceased Jews were burned in effigy, the two living ones were\r\ntorn with red-hot pincers and the Conversos were \"reconciled\" and\r\nstrangled before burning. The underlying purpose was revealed in the\r\nsentence read at the auto de fe, which was framed so as to bring into\r\nespecial prominence the proselyting efforts of the Jews and the\r\nJudaizing propensities of the Conversos and no effort was spared to\r\nproduce the widest impression on the people. We happen to know that the\r\nsentence was sent to La Guardia, to be read from the pulpit, and that it\r\nwas translated into Catalan and similarly published in Barcelona,\r\nshowing that it was thus brought before the whole population--a thing\r\nwithout parallel in the history of the Inquisition. The cult of the\r\nSaint-Child of La Guardia--_El santo niño de la Guardia_--was promptly\r\nstarted with miracles and has been kept up to the present day, although\r\nthe sanctity of the supposed martyr has never been confirmed by the Holy\r\nSee. Torquemada's object was gained for, though it would be too much to\r\nsay that this alone won Ferdinand's consent to the expulsion, it\r\nundoubtedly contributed largely to that result. The edict of expulsion,\r\nit is true, makes no direct reference to the case but, in its labored\r\nefforts to magnify the dangers of Jewish proselytism it reflects\r\ndistinctly the admissions extorted from the accused by the\r\nInquisition.[387]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EXPULSION OF THE JEWS_]\r\n\r\nWith the surrender of Granada in January, 1492, the work of the\r\nReconquest was accomplished. The Jews had zealously contributed to it\r\nand had done their work too well. With the accession of a rich territory\r\nand an industrious Moorish population and the cessation of the drain of\r\nthe war, even Ferdinand might persuade himself that the Jews were no\r\nlonger financially indispensable. The popular fanaticism required\r\nconstant repression to keep the peace; the operations of the Inquisition\r\ndestroyed the hope that gradual conversion would bring about the desired\r\nunity of faith and the only alternative was the removal of those who\r\ncould not, without a miraculous change of heart, be expected to\r\nencounter the terrible risks attendant upon baptism. It is easy thus to\r\nunderstand the motives leading to the measure, without attributing it,\r\nas has been done, to greed for the victims' wealth, for though, as we\r\nshall see, there are abundant evidences of a desire to profit by it, as\r\na whole it was palpably undesirable financially.\r\n\r\nThus the expulsion of the Jews from all the Spanish dominions came to be\r\nresolved upon. When this was bruited about the court, Abraham Senior and\r\nAbravanel offered a large sum from the aljamas to avert the blow.\r\nFerdinand was inclined to accept it, but Isabella was firm. The story is\r\ncurrent that, when the offer was under consideration, Torquemada forced\r\nhis way into the royal presence and holding aloft a crucifix boldly\r\naddressed the sovereigns: \"Behold the crucified whom the wicked Judas\r\nsold for thirty pieces of silver. If you approve that deed, sell him for\r\na greater sum. I resign my power; nothing shall be imputed to me but you\r\nwill answer to God!\"[388] Whether this be true or not, the offer was\r\nrejected and, on March 30th, the edict of expulsion was signed, though\r\napparently there was delay in its promulgation, for it was not published\r\nin Barcelona until May 1st.[389] It gave the entire Jewish population\r\nof Spain until July 31st in which to change their religion or to leave\r\nthe country, under penalty of death, which was likewise threatened for\r\nany attempt to return. During the interval they were taken under the\r\nroyal protection; they were permitted to sell their effects and carry\r\nthe proceeds with them, except that, under a general law, the export of\r\ngold and silver was prohibited.[390]\r\n\r\nA supplementary edict of May 14th granted permission to sell lands,\r\nleaving but little time in which to effect such transactions and this\r\nwas still more fatally limited in Aragon, where Ferdinand sequestrated\r\nall Jewish property in order to afford claimants and creditors the\r\nopportunity to prove their rights, the courts being ordered to decide\r\nall such cases promptly. Still less excusable was his detaining from all\r\nsales an amount equal to all the charges and taxes which the Jews would\r\nhave paid him, thus realizing a full year's revenue from the trifling\r\nsums obtained through forced sales by the unhappy exiles.[391] In\r\nCastile, the inextricable confusion arising from the extensive\r\ncommercial transactions of the Jews led to the issue, May 30th, of a\r\ndecree addressed to all the officials of the land, ordering all\r\ninterested parties to be summoned to appear within twenty days to prove\r\ntheir claims, which the courts must settle by the middle of July. All\r\ndebts falling due prior to the date of departure were to be promptly\r\npaid; if due to Christians by Jews who had not personal effects\r\nsufficient to satisfy them, the creditors were to take land at an\r\nappraised valuation or be paid out of other debts paid by Jews. For\r\ndebts falling due subsequently, if due by Jews, the debtors had to pay\r\nat once or furnish adequate security; if due by Christians or Moors, the\r\ncreditors were either to leave powers to collect at maturity or to sell\r\nthe claims to such purchasers as they could find.[392] These regulations\r\nafford us a glimpse into the complexities arising from the convulsion\r\nthus suddenly precipitated and, as the Jews were almost universally\r\ncreditors, we can readily imagine how great were their losses and how\r\nmany Christian debtors must have escaped payment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EXPULSION OF THE JEWS_]\r\n\r\nThe sovereigns also shared in the spoils. When the exiles reached the\r\nseaports to embark they found that an export duty of two ducats per head\r\nhad been levied upon them, which they were obliged to pay out of their\r\nimpoverished store.[393] Moreover, the threat of confiscation for those\r\nwho overstayed the time was rigorously enforced and, in some cases at\r\nleast, the property thus seized was granted to nobles to compensate\r\ntheir losses by the banishment of their Jews.[394] All effects left\r\nbehind also were seized; in many cases the dangers of the journey, the\r\nprohibition to carry coin and the difficulty of procuring bills of\r\nexchange, led the exiles to make deposits with trustworthy friends to be\r\nremitted to them in their new homes, all of which was seized by the\r\ncrown. The amount of this was sufficient to require a regular\r\norganization of officials deputed to hunt up these deposits and other\r\nfragments of property that could be escheated, and we find\r\ncorrespondence on the subject as late as 1498.[395] Efforts were even\r\nalso made to follow exiles and secure their property on the plea that\r\nthey had taken with them prohibited articles, and Henry VII of England\r\nand Ferdinand of Naples were appealed to for assistance in cases of this\r\ndescription.[396]\r\n\r\nThe terror and distress of the exodus, we are told, were greatly\r\nincreased by an edict issued by Torquemada, as inquisitor-general, in\r\nApril, forbidding any Christian, after August 9th, from holding any\r\ncommunication with Jews, or giving them food or shelter, or aiding them\r\nin any way.[397] Such addition to their woes was scarce necessary, for\r\nit would be difficult to exaggerate the misery inflicted on a population\r\nthus suddenly uprooted from a land in which their race was older than\r\nthat of their oppressors. Stunned at first by the blow, as soon as they\r\nrallied from the shock, they commenced preparations for departure. An\r\naged rabbi, Isaac Aboab, with thirty prominent colleagues, was\r\ncommissioned to treat with João II of Portugal for refuge in his\r\ndominions. He drove a hard bargain, demanding a cruzado a head for\r\npermission to enter and reside for six months.[398] For those who were\r\nnear the coasts, arrangements were made for transhipment by sea, mostly\r\nfrom Cadiz and Barcelona on the south and Laredo on the north. To the\r\nnorth-east, Navarre afforded an asylum, by order of Jean d'Albret and\r\nhis wife Leonora, although the cities were somewhat recalcitrant.[399]\r\nAs the term approached, two days' grace were allowed, bringing it to\r\nAugust 2d, the 9th of Ab, a day memorable in Jewish annals for its\r\nrepeated misfortunes.[400]\r\n\r\nThe sacrifices entailed on the exiles were enormous. To realize in so\r\nlimited a time on every species of property not portable, with means of\r\ntransportation so imperfect, was almost impossible and, in a forced sale\r\nof such magnitude, the purchasers had a vast advantage of which they\r\nfully availed themselves. An eye-witness tells us that the Christians\r\nbought their property for a trifle; they went around and found few\r\nbuyers, so that they were compelled to give a house for an ass and a\r\nvineyard for a little cloth or linen: in some places the miserable\r\nwretches, unable to get any price, burnt their homes and the aljamas\r\nbestowed the communal property on the cities. Their synagogues they were\r\nnot allowed to sell, the Christians taking them and converting them into\r\nchurches, wherein to worship a God of justice and love.[401] The\r\ncemeteries, for which they felt peculiar solicitude, were in many places\r\nmade over to the cities, on condition of preservation from desecration\r\nand use only for pasturage; where this was not done they were\r\nconfiscated and Torquemada obtained a fragment of the spoil by securing,\r\nMarch 23, 1494, from Ferdinand and Isabella, the grant of that of Avila\r\nfor his convent of Santo Tomas.[402]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EXPULSION OF THE JEWS_]\r\n\r\nThe resolute constancy displayed in this extremity was admirable. There\r\nwere comparatively few renegades and, if Abraham Senior was one of them,\r\nit is urged in extenuation that Isabella, who was loath to lose his\r\nservices, threatened, if he persisted in his faith, to adopt still\r\nsharper measures against his people and he, knowing her capacity in this\r\ndirection, submitted to baptism; he and his family had for god-parents\r\nthe sovereigns and Cardinal González de Mendoza; they assumed the name\r\nof Coronel which long remained distinguished.[403] The frailes exerted\r\nthemselves everywhere in preaching, but the converts were few and only\r\nof the lowest class; the Inquisition had changed the situation and San\r\nVicente Ferrer himself would have found missionary work unfruitful, for\r\nthe dread of exile was less than that of the Holy Office and the\r\n_quemadero_.\r\n\r\nThere was boundless mutual helpfulness; the rich aided the poor and they\r\nmade ready as best they could to face the perils of the unknown future.\r\nBefore starting, all the boys and girls over twelve were married. Early\r\nin July the exodus commenced and no better idea of this pilgrimage of\r\ngrief can be conveyed than by the simple narrative of the good cura of\r\nPalacios. Disregarding, he says, the wealth they left behind and\r\nconfiding in the blind hope that God would lead them to the promised\r\nland, they left their homes, great and small, old and young, on foot, on\r\nhorseback, on asses or other beasts or in wagons, some falling, others\r\nrising, some dying, others being born, others falling sick. There was no\r\nChristian who did not pity them; everywhere they were invited to\r\nconversion and some were baptized, but very few, for the rabbis\r\nencouraged them and made the women and children play on the timbrel.\r\nThose who went to Cadiz hoped that God would open a path for them across\r\nthe sea; but they stayed there many days, suffering much and many wished\r\nthat, they had never been born. From Aragon and Catalonia they put to\r\nsea for Italy or the Moorish lands or whithersoever fortune might drive\r\nthem. Most of them had evil fate, robbery and murder by sea and in the\r\nlands of their refuge. This is shown by the fate of those who sailed\r\nfrom Cadiz. They had to embark in twenty-five ships of which the captain\r\nwas Pero Cabron; they sailed for Oran where they found the corsair\r\nFragoso and his fleet; they promised him ten thousand ducats not to\r\nmolest them, to which he agreed, but night came on and they sailed for\r\nArcilla. (a Spanish settlement in Morocco), where a tempest scattered\r\nthem. Sixteen ships put into Cartagena, where a hundred and fifty souls\r\nlanded and asked for baptism; then the fleet went to Málaga, where four\r\nhundred more did the same. The rest reached Arcilla and went to Fez.\r\nMultitudes also sailed from Gibraltar to Arcilla, whence they set out\r\nfor Fez, under guard of Moors hired for the purpose, but they were\r\nrobbed on the journey and their wives and daughters were violated. Many\r\nreturned to Arcilla, where the new arrivals, on hearing of this,\r\nremained, forming a large camp. Then they divided into two parties, one\r\npersisting in going to Fez, the other preferring baptism at Arcilla,\r\nwhere the commandant, the Count of Boron, treated them kindly and the\r\npriests baptized them in squads with sprinklers. The count sent them\r\nback to Spain and, up to 1496, they were returning for baptism--in\r\nPalacios, Bernaldez baptized as many as a hundred, some of them being\r\nrabbis. Those who reached Fez were naked and starving and lousy. The\r\nking, seeing them a burden, permitted them to return and they straggled\r\nback to Arcilla, robbed and murdered on the road, the women violated and\r\nthe men often cut open in search of gold thought to be concealed in\r\ntheir stomachs. Those who remained in Fez built a great Jewry for\r\nthemselves of houses of straw; one night it took fire, burning all their\r\nproperty and fifty or a hundred souls--after which came a pestilence,\r\ncarrying off more than four thousand. Ferdinand and Isabella, seeing\r\nthat all who could get back returned for baptism, set guards to keep\r\nthem out unless they had money to support themselves.[404]\r\n\r\nThe whole world was pitiless to these wretched outcasts, against whom\r\nevery man's hand was raised. Those who sought Portugal utilized the six\r\nmonths allotted to them by sending a party to Fez to arrange for transit\r\nthere; many went and formed part of the luckless band whose misfortunes\r\nwe have seen. Others remained, the richer paying the king a hundred\r\ncruzados per household, the poorer eight cruzados a head, while a\r\nthousand, who could pay nothing, were enslaved. These King Manoel\r\nemancipated, on his accession in 1495, but in 1497 he enforced\r\nconversion on all. Then in Lisbon, at Easter, 1506, a New Christian in a\r\nDominican church, chanced to express a doubt as to a miraculous\r\ncrucifix, when he was dragged out by the hair and slain; the Dominicans\r\nharangued the mob, parading the streets with the crucifix and exciting\r\npopular passion till a massacre ensued in which the most revolting\r\ncruelties were perpetrated. It raged for three days and ended only when\r\nno more victims could be found, the number of slain being estimated at\r\nseveral thousand.[405] The further fate of these refugees we shall have\r\noccasion to trace hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FATE OF THE EXILES_]\r\n\r\nIn Navarre, where the exiles had been kindly received, the era of\r\ntoleration was brief. In 1498, an edict, based on that of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, gave them the alternative of baptism or expulsion and, at the\r\nsame time, such difficulties were thrown in the way of exile that they\r\nmostly submitted to baptism and remained a discredited class, subjected\r\nto numerous disabilities.[406] Naples, whither numbers flocked, afforded\r\nan inhospitable refuge. In August, 1492, nine caravels arrived there,\r\nloaded with Jews and infected with pestilence, which they communicated\r\nto the city, whence it spread through the kingdom and raged for a year,\r\ncausing a mortality of twenty thousand. Then, in the confusion following\r\nthe invasion of Charles VIII, in 1495, the people rose against them;\r\nmany abandoned their religion to escape slaughter or slavery; many were\r\ncarried off to distant lands and sold as slaves; this tribulation lasted\r\nfor three years, during which those who were steadfast in the faith were\r\nimprisoned or burnt or exposed to the caprices of the mob.[407] Turkey,\r\non the whole, proved the most satisfactory refuge, where Bajazet found\r\nthem such profitable subjects that he ridiculed the wisdom popularly\r\nascribed to the Spanish sovereigns who could commit so great an act of\r\nfolly. Though exposed to occasional persecution, they continued to\r\nflourish; most of the existing Jews of Turkey in Europe and a large\r\nportion of those of Turkey in Asia, are descendants of the exiles; they\r\nabsorbed the older communities and their language is still the Spanish\r\nof the sixteenth century.[408]\r\n\r\nWhen the fate of the exiles was, for the most part, so unendurable, it\r\nwas natural that many should seek to return to their native land and, as\r\nwe have seen from Bernaldez, large numbers did so. At first this was\r\ntacitly permitted, on condition of conversion, provided they brought\r\nmoney with them, but the sovereigns finally grew fearful that the purity\r\nof the faith would be impaired and, in 1499, an explanatory edict was\r\nissued, decreeing death and confiscation for any Jew entering Spain,\r\nwhether a foreigner or returning exile, even if he asked for baptism,\r\nunless beforehand he sent word that he wished to come for that purpose,\r\nwhen he was to be baptized at the port of entry and a notarial act was\r\nto be taken. That this savage edict was pitilessly enforced is\r\nmanifested by several cases in 1500 and 1501. Moreover, all masters of\r\nJewish slaves were ordered to send them out of the country within two\r\nmonths, unless they would submit to baptism.[409] Spain was too holy a\r\nland to be polluted with the presence of a Jew, even in captivity.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of trustworthy statistics, all estimates of the number of\r\nvictims must be more or less a matter of guess-work and consequently\r\nthey vary with the impressions or imagination of the annalist. Bernaldez\r\ninforms us that Rabbi Mair wrote to Abraham Senior that the sovereigns\r\nhad banished 35,000 vassals, that is, 35,000 Jewish households, and he\r\nadds that, of the ten or twelve rabbis whom he baptized on their return,\r\na very intelligent one, named Zentollo of Vitoria, told him that there\r\nwere in Castile more than 30,000 married Jews and 6000 in the kingdoms\r\nof Aragon, making 160,000 souls when the edict was issued, which is\r\nprobably as nearly correct an estimate as we can find.[410] With time\r\nthe figures grew. Albertino, Inquisitor of Valencia, in 1534, quotes\r\nReuchlin as computing the number of exiles at 420,000.[411] The cautious\r\nZurita quotes Bernaldez and adds that others put the total at 400,000,\r\nwhile Mariana tells us that most authors assert the number of households\r\nto have been 170,000, and some put the total at 800,000 souls; Páramo\r\nquotes the figures of 124,000 households or over 600,000 souls.[412]\r\nIsidore Loeb, after an exhaustive review of all authorities, Jewish and\r\nChristian, reaches the estimate[413]--\r\n\r\n  Emigrants,      165,000\r\n  Baptized,        50,000\r\n  Died,            20,000\r\n                  -------\r\n                  235,000\r\n\r\nand this, in view of the diminished number of Jews, as shown by the\r\nRepartimiento of 1474 (p. 125) is probably too large an estimate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CONTEMPORARY OPINION_]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the number, the sum of human misery was\r\nincomputable. Rabbi Joseph, whose father was one of the exiles,\r\neloquently describes the sufferings of his race: \"For some of them the\r\nTurks killed to take out the gold which they had swallowed to hide it;\r\nsome of them hunger and the plague consumed and some of them were cast\r\nnaked by the captains on the isles of the sea; and some of them were\r\nsold for men-servants and maid-servants in Genoa and its villages and\r\nsome of them were cast into the sea.... For there were among those who\r\nwere cast into the isles of the sea upon Provence a Jew and his old\r\nfather fainting from hunger, begging bread, for there was no one to\r\nbreak unto him in a strange country. And the man went and sold his son\r\nfor bread to restore the soul of the old man. And it came to pass, when\r\nhe returned to his old father, that he found him fallen down dead and he\r\nrent his clothes. And he returned unto the baker to take his son and the\r\nbaker would not give him back and he cried out with a loud and bitter\r\ncry for his son and there was none to deliver.\"[414] Penniless,\r\nfriendless and despised they were cast forth into a world which had been\r\ntaught that to oppress them was a service to the Redeemer.\r\n\r\nYet such were the convictions of the period, in the fifteenth century\r\nafter Christ had died for man, that this crime against humanity met with\r\nnothing but applause among contemporaries. Men might admit that it was\r\nunwise from the point of view of statesmanship and damaging to the\r\nprosperity of the land, but this only enhanced the credit due to the\r\nsovereigns whose piety was equal to the sacrifice. When, in 1495,\r\nAlexander VI granted to them the proud title of Catholic Kings, the\r\nexpulsion of the Jews was enumerated among the services to the faith\r\nentitling them to this distinction.[415] Even so liberal and cultured a\r\nthinker as Gian Pico della Mirandola, praises them for it, while he\r\nadmits that even Christians were moved to pity by the calamities of the\r\nsufferers, nearly all of whom were consumed by shipwreck, pestilence and\r\nhunger, rendering the destruction equal to that inflicted by Titus and\r\nHadrian.[416] It is true that Machiavelli, faithful to his general\r\nprinciples, seeks to find in Ferdinand's participation a political\r\nrather than a religious motive, but even he characterizes the act as a\r\n_pietosa crudeltà_.[417] So far, indeed, was it from being a cruelty, in\r\nthe eyes of the theologians of the period, that Ferdinand was held to\r\nhave exercised his power mercifully, for Arnaldo Albertino proved by the\r\ncanon law that he would have been fully justified in putting them all to\r\nthe sword and seizing their property.[418]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Edict of Expulsion proclaimed to the world the policy which in its\r\ncontinuous development did so much for the abasement of Spain. At the\r\nsame time it closed the career of avowed Jews in the Spanish dominions.\r\nHenceforth we shall meet with them as apostate Christians, the occasion\r\nand the victims of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE INQUISITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch as the Conversos had gained, from a worldly point of view, by their\r\nchange of religion, their position, in one respect, as we have seen, was\r\nseriously deteriorated. As Jews they might be despoiled and humiliated,\r\nconfined in narrow Jewries and restricted as to their careers and means\r\nof livelihood, but withal they enjoyed complete freedom of faith, in\r\nwhich they were subjected only to their own rabbis. They were outside of\r\nthe Church and the Church claimed no jurisdiction over them in matters\r\nof religion, so long as they did not openly blaspheme Christianity or\r\nseek to make proselytes. As soon, however, as the convert was baptized\r\nhe became a member of the Church and for any aberration from orthodoxy\r\nhe was amenable to its laws. As the Inquisition had never existed in\r\nCastile and was inactive in Aragon, while the bishops, who held ordinary\r\njurisdiction over heresy and apostasy, were too turbulent and worldly to\r\nwaste thought on the exercise of their authority in such matters, the\r\nConversos seem never to have recognized the possibility of being held to\r\naccount for any secret leaning to the faith which they had ostensibly\r\nabandoned. The circumstances under which the mass of conversions was\r\neffected--threats of massacre or the wearing pressure of inhuman\r\nlaws--were not such as to justify confidence in the sincerity of the\r\nneophytes, nor, when baptism was administered indiscriminately to\r\nmultitudes, was there a possibility of detailed instruction in the\r\ncomplicated theology of their new faith. Rabbinical Judaism, moreover,\r\nso entwines itself with every detail of the believer's daily life, and\r\nattaches so much importance to the observances which it enjoins, that it\r\nwas impossible for whole communities thus suddenly Christianized, to\r\nabandon the rites and usages which, through so many generations, had\r\nbecome a part of existence itself. Earnest converts might have brought\r\nup their children as Christians and the grandchildren might have\r\noutgrown the old customs, but the Conversos could not be earnest\r\nconverts, and the sacred traditions, handed down by father to son from\r\nthe days of the Sanhedrin, were too precious to be set aside. The\r\n_Anusim_, as they were known to their Hebrew brethren, thus were\r\nunwilling Christians, practising what Jewish rites they dared, and it\r\nwas held to be the duty of all Jews to bring them back to the true\r\nfaith.[419]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _JUDAISM OF CONVERSOS_]\r\n\r\nAs soon, therefore, as the Church had gained her new recruits she began\r\nto regard them with a pardonable degree of suspicion, although she seems\r\nto have made no effort to instruct them in her doctrines after hurriedly\r\nbaptizing them by the thousand. In 1429 the council of Tortosa\r\nindignantly denounced the unspeakable cruelty of the Conversos who, with\r\ndamnable negligence, permit their children to remain in servitude of the\r\ndevil by omitting to have them baptized. To remedy this the Ordinaries\r\nwere ordered, by the free use of ecclesiastical censures, and by calling\r\nin if necessary the secular arm, to cause all such children to be\r\nbaptized within eight days after birth, and all temporal lords were\r\ncommanded to lend their aid in this pious work.[420] The outlook,\r\ncertainly, was not promising that the coming generation should be free\r\nfrom the inveterate Jewish errors. How little concealment, indeed, was\r\nthought necessary by the Conversos, so long as they exhibited a nominal\r\nadherence to Catholicism, is plainly shown by the testimony in the early\r\ntrials before the Inquisition, where servants and neighbors give ample\r\nevidence as to Jewish observances openly followed. Still more conclusive\r\nis a case occurring, in 1456, in Rosellon, which, although at the time\r\nheld in pawn by France, was subject to the Inquisition of Aragon.\r\nCertain Conversos not only persisted in Jewish practices, such as eating\r\nmeat in lent, but forced their Christian servants to do likewise, and\r\nwhen the inquisitor, Fray Mateo de Rapica, with the aid of the Bishop of\r\nElna, sought to reduce them to conformity, they defiantly published a\r\ndefamatory libel upon him and, with the assistance of certain laymen,\r\nafflicted him with injuries and expenses.[421] It was not without cause\r\nthat, when Bishop Alfonso de Santa María procured the decree of 1434\r\nfrom the council of Basle, he included a clause branding as heretics all\r\nConversos who adhered to Jewish superstitions, directing bishops and\r\ninquisitors to enquire strictly after them and to punish them condignly,\r\nand pronouncing liable to the penalties of fautorship all who support\r\nthem in those practices.[422] The decree, of course, proved a dead\r\nletter, but none the less was it the foreshadowing of the Inquisition.\r\nWhen Nicholas V, in 1449, issued his bull in favor of the Conversos, he\r\nfollowed the example of the council of Basle, in excepting those who\r\nsecretly continued to practise Jewish rites. In the methods commonly\r\nemployed to procure conversions the result was inevitable and incurable.\r\n\r\nWhat rendered this especially serious was the success of the Conversos\r\nin obtaining high office in Church and State. Important sees were\r\noccupied by bishops of Jewish blood; the chapters, the monastic orders\r\nand the curacies were full of them; they were prominent in the royal\r\ncouncil and everywhere enjoyed positions of influence. The most powerful\r\namong them--the Santa Marías, the Dávilas and their following--had\r\nturned against the royal favorite Alvaro de Luna and, with the\r\ndiscontented nobles, were plotting his ruin, when he seems to have\r\nconceived the idea that, if he could introduce the Inquisition in\r\nCastile, he might find in it a weapon wherewith to subdue them. At least\r\nthis is the only explanation of an application made to Nicholas V, in\r\n1451, by Juan II, for a delegation of papal inquisitorial power for the\r\nchastisement of Judaizing Christians. The popes had too long vainly\r\ndesired to introduce the Inquisition in Castile for Nicholas to neglect\r\nthis opportunity. He promptly commissioned the Bishop of Osma, his vicar\r\ngeneral, and the Scholasticus of Salamanca as inquisitors, either by\r\nthemselves or through such delegates as they might appoint, to\r\ninvestigate and punish without appeal all such offenders, to deprive\r\nthem of ecclesiastical dignities and benefices and of temporal\r\npossessions, to pronounce them incapable of holding such positions in\r\nfuture, to imprison and degrade them, and, if the offence required, to\r\nabandon them to the secular arm for burning. Full power was granted to\r\nperform any acts necessary or opportune to the discharge of these duties\r\nand, if resistance were offered, to invoke the aid of the secular power.\r\nAll this was within the regular routine of the inquisitorial office, but\r\nthere was one clause which showed that the object of the measure was the\r\ndestruction of de Luna's enemies, the Converso bishops, for the\r\ncommission empowered the appointees to proceed even against bishops--a\r\nfaculty never before granted to inquisitors and subsequently, as we\r\nshall see, withheld when the new Inquisition was organized.[423] All\r\nthis was the formal establishment of the Inquisition on Castilian soil\r\nand, if circumstances had permitted its development, it would not have\r\nbeen left for Isabella to introduce the institution. The Inquisition,\r\nhowever, rested on the secular power for its efficiency. In Spain,\r\nespecially, there was little respect for the naked papal authority,\r\nwhile that of Juan II was too much enfeebled to enable him to establish\r\nso serious an innovation. The New Christians recognized that their\r\nsafety depended on de Luna's downfall; the conspiracy against him won\r\nover the nerveless Juan II and, in 1453, he was hurriedly condemned and\r\nexecuted. Naturally the bull remained inoperative, and, some ten years\r\nlater, Alonso de Espina feelingly complains \"Some are heretics and\r\nChristian perverts, others are Jews, others Saracens, others devils.\r\nThere is no one to investigate the errors of the heretics. The ravening\r\nwolves, O Lord, have entered thy flock, for the shepherds are few; many\r\nare hirelings and as hirelings they care only for shearing and not for\r\nfeeding thy sheep.\"[424]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALONSO DE ESPINA]\r\n\r\nTo Fray Alonso de Espina may be ascribed a large share in hastening the\r\ndevelopment of organized persecution in Spain, by inflaming the race\r\nhatred of recent origin which already needed no stimulation. He was a\r\nman of the highest reputation for learning and sanctity and when, early\r\nin his career, he was discouraged by the slender result of his\r\npreaching, a miracle revealed to him the favor of Heaven and induced him\r\nto persevere.[425] In 1453 we find him administering to Alvaro de Luna\r\nthe last consolations of religion at his hurried execution, and he\r\nbecame the confessor of Henry IV.[426] In 1454, when a child was robbed\r\nand murdered at Valladolid and the body was scratched up by dogs, the\r\nJews were, of course, suspected and confession was obtained by torture.\r\nAlonso happened to be there and aroused much public excitement by his\r\nsermons on the subject, in which he asserted that the Jews had ripped\r\nout the child's heart, had burnt it and, by mingling the ashes with\r\nwine, had made an unholy sacrament, but unfortunately, as he tells us,\r\nbribery of the judges and of King Henry enabled the offenders to\r\nescape.[427] The next year, 1455, as Provincial of the Observantine\r\nFranciscans, he was engaged in an unsuccessful attempt to drive the\r\nConventuals out of Segovia or to obtain a separate convent for the\r\nObservantines.[428] Thenceforth he seems to have concentrated his\r\nenergies on the endeavor to bring about the forced conversion of the\r\nJews and to introduce the Inquisition as a corrective of the apostasy of\r\nthe Conversos. He is usually considered to have himself belonged to the\r\nclass of Converso who entertained an inextinguishable hatred for their\r\nformer brethren, but there is no evidence of this and the probabilities\r\nare altogether against it.[429]\r\n\r\nHis _Fortalicium Fidei_ is a deplorable exhibition of the fanatic\r\npassions which finally dominated Spain. He rakes together, from the\r\nchronicles of all Europe, the stories of Jews slaying Christian children\r\nin their unholy rites, of their poisoning wells and fountains, of their\r\nstarting conflagrations and of all the other horrors by which a healthy\r\ndetestation of the unfortunate race was created and stimulated. The\r\nJewish law, he tells us, commands them to slay Christians and to\r\ndespoil them whenever practicable and they obey it with quenchless\r\nhatred and insatiable thirst for revenge. Thrice a day in their prayers\r\nthey repeat \"Let there be no hope for Meschudanim (Conversos); may all\r\nheretics and all who speak against Israel be speedily cut off; may the\r\nkingdom of the proud be broken and destroyed and may all our enemies be\r\ncrushed and humbled speedily in our days!\"[430] But the evil now wrought\r\nby Jews is trifling to that which they will work at the coming of\r\nAntichrist, for they will be his supporters. Alexander the Great shut\r\nthem up in the mountains of the Caspian, adjoining the realms of the\r\nGreat Khan or monarch of Cathay. There, between the castles of Gog and\r\nMagog, confined by an enchanted wall, they have multiplied until now\r\nthey are numerous enough to fill twenty-four kingdoms. When Antichrist\r\ncomes they will break loose and rally around him, as likewise will all\r\nthe Jews of the Diaspora, for they will regard him as their promised\r\nMessiah and will worship him as their God, and with their united aid he\r\nwill overrun the earth. With such eventualities in prospect it is no\r\nwonder that Fray Alonso could convince himself, in opposition to the\r\ncanon law, that the forced conversion of the Jews was lawful and\r\nexpedient, as well as the baptism of their children without their\r\nconsent.[431] When such was the temper in which a man of distinguished\r\nlearning and intelligence discussed the relations between Jews and\r\nChristians, we can imagine the character of the sermons in which, from\r\nnumerous pulpits, the passions of the people were inflamed against their\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _JUDAISM OF CONVERSOS_]\r\n\r\nIf open Judaism thus was abhorrent, still worse was the insidious heresy\r\nof the Conversos who pretended to be Christians and who more or less\r\nopenly continued to practise Jewish rites and perverted the faithful by\r\ntheir influence and example. These abounded on every hand and there was\r\nscarce an effort made to repress or to punish them. The law, from the\r\nearliest times, provided the death penalty for their offence, but there\r\nwas none found to enforce it.[432] Fray Alonso dolefully asserts that\r\nthey succeeded by their presents in so blinding princes and prelates\r\nthat they were never punished and that, when one person accused them,\r\nthree would come forward in their favor. He relates an instance of such\r\nan attempt, in 1458 at Formesta, where a barber named Fernando Sánchez\r\npublicly maintained monotheism. Fortunately Bishop Pedro of Palencia had\r\nzeal enough to prosecute him, when his offence was proved and, under\r\nfear of the death penalty, he recanted, but when he was condemned to\r\nimprisonment for life so much sympathy was excited by the unaccustomed\r\nseverity that, in accordance with numerous petitions, the sentence was\r\ncommuted to ten years' exile. In 1459, at Segovia, a number of Conversos\r\nwere by an accident discovered in the synagogue, praying at the feast of\r\nTabernacles, but nothing seems to have been done with them. At Medina\r\ndel Campo, in the same year, Fray Alonso was informed that there were\r\nmore than a hundred who denied the truth of the New Testament, but he\r\ncould do nothing save preach against them, and subsequently he learned\r\nthat in one house there were more than thirty men, at that very time,\r\nlaid up in consequence of undergoing circumcision. It is no wonder that\r\nhe earnestly advocated the introduction of the Inquisition as the only\r\ncure for this scandalous condition of affairs, that he argued in its\r\nfavor with the warmest zeal and answered all objections in a manner\r\nwhich showed that he was familiar with its workings from a careful study\r\nof the Clementines and of Eymeric's Directorium.[433]\r\n\r\nThe good Cura de los Palacios is equally emphatic in his testimony as to\r\nthe prevalence of Judaism among the Conversos. For the most part, he\r\nsays, they continued to be Jews, or rather they were neither Christians\r\nnor Jews but heretics, and this heresy increased and flourished through\r\nthe riches and pride of many wise and learned men, bishops and canons\r\nand friars and abbots and financial agents and secretaries of the king\r\nand of the magnates. At the commencement of the reign of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella this heresy grew so powerful that the clerks were on the point\r\nof preaching the law of Moses. These heretics avoided baptizing their\r\nchildren and, when they could not prevent it, they washed off the\r\nbaptism on returning from the church; they ate meat on fast days and\r\nunleavened bread at Passover, which they observed as well as the\r\nSabbaths; they had Jews who secretly preached in their houses and rabbis\r\nwho slaughtered meat and birds for them; they performed all the Jewish\r\nceremonies in secret as well as they could and avoided, as far as\r\npossible, receiving the sacrament; they never confessed truly--a\r\nconfessor, after hearing one of them, cut off a corner of his garment\r\nsaying \"Since you have never sinned I want a piece of your clothes as a\r\nrelic to cure the sick.\" Many of them attained to great wealth, for they\r\nhad no conscience in usury, saying that they were spoiling the\r\nEgyptians. They assumed airs of superiority, asserting that there was no\r\nbetter race on earth, nor wiser, nor shrewder, nor more honorable\r\nthrough their descent from the tribes of Israel.[434]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COMMENCEMENT OF PERSECUTION_]\r\n\r\nIn fact, when we consider the popular detestation of the Conversos and\r\nthe invitation to attack afforded by their Judaizing tendencies, the\r\npostponement in establishing the Inquisition is attributable to the\r\nall-pervading lawlessness of the period and the absence of a strong\r\ncentral power. The people gratified their hatred by an occasional\r\nmassacre, with its accompanying pillage, but among the various factions\r\nof the distracted state no one was strong enough to attempt a systematic\r\nmovement provoking the bitterest opposition of a powerful class whose\r\nmembers occupied confidential positions in the court not alone of the\r\nking but of every noble and prelate. Earnest and untiring as was Fray\r\nAlonso's zeal it therefore was fruitless. In August, 1461, he induced\r\nthe heads of the Observantine Franciscans to address the chapter of the\r\nGeronimites urging a union of both bodies in the effort to obtain the\r\nintroduction of the Inquisition. The suggestion was favorably received\r\nbut the answer was delayed, and the impatient Fray Alonso, with Fray\r\nFernando de la Plaza and other Observantines, appealed directly to King\r\nHenry, representing the prevalence of the Judaizing heresy throughout\r\nthe land and the habitual circumcision of the children of\r\nConversos.[435] The zeal of Fray Fernando outran his discretion and in\r\nhis sermons he declared that he possessed the foreskins of children\r\nthus treated. King Henry sent for him and said that this practice was a\r\ngross insult to the Church, which it was his duty to punish, ordering\r\nhim to produce the objects and reveal the names of the culprits. The\r\nfraile could only reply that he had heard it from persons of repute and\r\nauthority, but, on being commanded to state their names, refused to do\r\nso, thus tacitly acknowledging that he had no proof. The Conversos were\r\nnot slow in taking advantage of his blunder and, to crown the defeat of\r\nthe Observantines, the Geronimites changed their views. Their general,\r\nFray Alonso de Oropesa, who himself had Jewish blood in his veins, was a\r\nman deservedly esteemed; under his impulsion they mounted the pulpit in\r\ndefence of the Conversos and the Observantines for the time were\r\nsilenced.[436] While the labors of the fiery Fray Alonso were\r\nunquestionably successful in intensifying the bitterness of race hatred,\r\ntheir only direct result was seen in the Concordia of Medina del Campo\r\nbetween Henry IV and his revolted nobles in 1464-5. In this an elaborate\r\nclause deplored the spread of the Judaizing heresy; it ordered the\r\nbishops to establish a searching inquisition throughout all lands and\r\nlordships, regardless of franchises and privileges, for the detection\r\nand punishment of the heretics; it pledged the king to support the\r\nmeasure in every way and to employ the confiscations in the war with the\r\nMoors and it pointed out that the enforcement of this plan would put an\r\nend to the tumults and massacres directed against the suspects.[437]\r\nUnder this impulsion some desultory persecution occurred. In the trial\r\nof Beatriz Nuñez, by the Inquisition of Toledo in 1485, witnesses allude\r\nto her husband, Fernando González who, some twenty years before, had\r\nbeen convicted and reconciled.[438] More detailed is a case occurring at\r\nLlerena in 1467, where, on September 17th, two Conversos, Garcí\r\nFernández Valency and Pedro Franco de Villareal, were discovered in the\r\nact of performing Jewish ceremonies. The alcalde mayor, Alvaro de\r\nCéspedes, at once seized them and carried them before the episcopal\r\nvicar, Joan Millan. They confessed their Judaism and the vicar at once\r\nsentenced them to be burnt alive, which was executed the same day; two\r\nwomen compromised in the matter were condemned to other penalties and\r\nthe house in which the heresy had been perpetrated was torn down.[439]\r\nIn such cases the bishops were merely exercising their imprescriptible\r\njurisdiction over heresy, but the prelacy of Castile was too much\r\noccupied with worldly affairs to devote any general or sustained energy\r\nto the suppression of Judaizers, and the land was too anarchical for the\r\nroyal power to exert any influence in carrying the Concordia into\r\neffect; the Deposition of Avila, which followed in the next year,\r\nplunged everything again into confusion and the only real importance of\r\nthe attempt lies in its significance of what was impending when peace\r\nand a strong government should render such a measure feasible. Yet it is\r\na noteworthy fact that, in all the long series of the Córtes of Castile,\r\nfrom the earliest times, the proceedings of which have been published in\r\nfull, there was no petition for anything approaching an Inquisition. In\r\nthe fourteenth century there were many complaints about the Jews and\r\npetitions for restrictive laws, but these diminish in the fifteenth\r\ncentury and the later Córtes, from 1450 on, are almost free from them.\r\nThe fearful disorders of the land gave the procurators or deputies\r\nenough to complain about and they seem to have had no time to waste on\r\nproblematical dangers to religion.[440]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PRELIMINARY MOVEMENTS_]\r\n\r\nThis was the situation at the accession of Ferdinand and Isabella in\r\n1474. Some years were necessary to settle the question of the\r\nsuccession, disputed by the unfortunate Beltraneja, and to quell the\r\nunruly nobles. During this period Sixtus IV renewed the attempt to\r\nintroduce the papal Inquisition, for, in sending Nicoló Franco to\r\nCastile as legate, he commissioned him with full inquisitorial faculties\r\nto prosecute and punish the false Christians who after baptism persisted\r\nin the observance of Jewish rites.[441] The effort, however, was\r\nfruitless and is interesting chiefly from the evidence which it gives of\r\nthe desire of Sixtus to give to Castile the blessing of the Inquisition.\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, as we have seen, were habitually jealous of\r\npapal encroachments and were anxious to limit rather than to extend the\r\nlegatine functions; they did not respond to the papal zeal for the\r\npurity of the faith and even when quiet was to a great extent restored\r\nthey took no initiative with regard to a matter which had seemed to Fray\r\nAlonso de Espina so immeasurably important. In his capacity of agitator\r\nhe had been succeeded by Fray Alonso de Hojeda, prior of the Dominican\r\nhouse of San Pablo of Seville, who devoted himself to the destruction of\r\nJudaism, both open as professed by the Jews and concealed as attributed\r\nto the Conversos. The battle of Toro, March 1, 1476, virtually broke up\r\nthe party of the Beltraneja, of which the leaders made their peace as\r\nbest they could, and the sovereigns could at last undertake the task of\r\npacifying the land. At the end of July, 1477, Isabella, after capturing\r\nthe castle of Trugillo, came, as we have seen, to Seville where she\r\nremained until October, 1478.[442] The presence of the court, with\r\nConversos filling many of its most important posts, excited Fray Alonso\r\nto greater ardor than ever. It was in vain, however, that he called the\r\nqueen's attention to the danger threatening the faith and the State from\r\nthe multitude of pretended Christians in high places. She was receiving\r\nfaithful service from members of the class accused and she probably was\r\ntoo much occupied with the business in hand to undertake a task that\r\ncould be postponed. It is said that her confessor, Torquemada, at an\r\nearlier period, had induced her to take a vow that, when she should\r\nreach the throne, she would devote her life to the extirpation of heresy\r\nand the supremacy of the Catholic faith, but this may safely be\r\ndismissed as a legend of later date.[443] Be this as it may, all that\r\nwas done at the moment was that Pero González de Mendoza, then\r\nArchbishop of Seville, held a synod in which was promulgated a catechism\r\nsetting forth the belief and duties of the Christian, which was\r\npublished in the churches and hung up for public information in every\r\nparish, while the priests were exhorted to increased vigilance and the\r\nfrailes to fresh zeal in making converts.[444] The adoption of such a\r\ndevice betrays the previous neglect of all instruction of the Marranos\r\nin the new religion imposed on them.\r\n\r\nThe court left Seville and Hojeda's opportunity seemed to have passed\r\naway. Whatever alacrity the priests may have shown in obeying their\r\narchbishop, nothing was accomplished nor was the increased zeal of the\r\nfrailes rewarded with success. There is a story accredited by all\r\nhistorians of the Inquisition that Hojeda chanced to hear of a meeting\r\nof Jews and Conversos on the night of Good Friday, March 28, 1478, to\r\ncelebrate their impious rites and that he hastened with the evidence to\r\nCórdova and laid it before the sovereigns, resulting in the punishment\r\nof the culprits and turning the scale in favor of introducing the\r\nInquisition, but there is no contemporary evidence of its truth and the\r\ndates are irreconcilable, nor was such an incentive necessary.[445] The\r\ninsincerity of the conversion of a large portion of the Marranos was\r\nincontestable; according to the principles universally accepted at the\r\nperiod it was the duty of the sovereigns to reduce them to conformity;\r\nwith the pacification of the land the time had come to attempt this\r\nresolutely and comprehensively and the only question was as to the\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITION APPLIED FOR_]\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that there should have been a prolonged struggle in\r\nthe court before the drastic remedy of the Inquisition was adopted. The\r\nefforts of its advocates were directed, not against the despised and\r\nfriendless Jews, but against the powerful Conversos, embracing many of\r\nthe most trusted counsellors of the sovereigns and men high in station\r\nin the Church, who could not but recognize the danger impending on all\r\nwho traced their descent from Israel. There seems at first to have been\r\na kind of compromise adopted, under which Pedro Fernández de Solis,\r\nBishop of Cadiz, who was Provisor of Seville, with the Assistente Diego\r\nde Merlo, Fray Alfonso de Hojeda and some other frailes were\r\ncommissioned to take charge of the matter, with power to inflict\r\npunishment. This resulted in a report by the commissioners to the\r\nsovereigns that a great portion of the citizens of Seville were infected\r\nwith heresy, that it involved men high in station and power, and that it\r\nspread throughout not only Andalusia but Castile, so that it was\r\nincurable save by the organization of the Inquisition.[446] The\r\nArchbishop Mendoza, doubtless disgusted with the failure of his methods\r\nof instruction, joined in these representations and they had a powerful\r\nsupporter in Fray Thomas de Torquemada, prior of the Dominican convent\r\nof Santa Cruz in Segovia, who, as confessor of the sovereigns, had much\r\ninfluence over them and who had long been urging the vigorous\r\nchastisement of heresy.[447] At last the victory was won. Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella resolved to introduce the Inquisition in the Castilian kingdoms\r\nand their ambassadors to the Holy See, the Bishop of Osma and his\r\nbrother Diego de Santillan, were ordered to procure the necessary bull\r\nfrom Sixtus IV.[448] This must have been shrouded in profound secrecy,\r\nfor, in July, 1478, while negotiations must have been on foot in Rome,\r\nFerdinand and Isabella convoked a national synod at Seville which sat\r\nuntil August 1st. In the propositions laid by the sovereigns before this\r\nbody there is no hint that such a measure was desired or proposed and,\r\nin the deliberations of the assembled prelates, there is no indication\r\nthat the Church thought any action against the Conversos necessary.[449]\r\nEven as late as 1480, after the procurement of the bull and before its\r\nenforcement, the Córtes of Toledo presented to the sovereigns a detailed\r\nmemorial embodying all the measures of reform desired by the people. In\r\nthis the separation of Christians from Jews and Moors is asked for, but\r\nthere is no request for the prosecution of apostate Conversos.[450]\r\nEvidently there was no knowledge of and no popular demand for the\r\nimpending Inquisition.\r\n\r\nSixtus can have been nothing loath to accomplish the introduction of the\r\nInquisition in Castile, which his predecessors had so frequently and so\r\nvainly attempted and which he had essayed to do a few years previous by\r\ngranting the necessary faculties to his legate. If the request of the\r\nCastilian sovereigns, therefore, was not immediately granted it cannot\r\nhave been from humanitarian motives as alleged by some modern\r\napologists, but because Ferdinand and Isabella desired, not the\r\nordinary papal Inquisition, but one which should be under the royal\r\ncontrol and should pour into the royal treasury the resultant\r\nconfiscations. Hitherto the appointment of inquisitors had always been\r\nmade by the Provincials of the Dominican or Franciscan Orders according\r\nas the territory belonged to one or to the other, with occasional\r\ninterference on the part of the Holy See, from which the commissions\r\nemanated. It was a delegation of the supreme papal authority and had\r\nalways been held completely independent of the secular power, but\r\nFerdinand and Isabella were too jealous of papal interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of their kingdoms to permit this, and it is an evidence\r\nof the extreme desire of Sixtus to extend the Inquisition over Castile\r\nthat he consented to make so important a concession. There also was\r\ndoubtless discussion over the confiscations which the wealth of the\r\nConversos promised to render large. This was a matter in which there was\r\nno universally recognized practice. In France they enured to the\r\ntemporal seigneur. In Italy the custom varied at different times and in\r\nthe various states, but the papacy assumed to control it and, in the\r\nfourteenth century, it claimed the whole, to be divided equally between\r\nthe Inquisition and the papal camera.[451] The matter was evidently one\r\nto be determined by negotiation, and in this too the sovereigns had\r\ntheir way, for the confiscations were tacitly abandoned to them. Nothing\r\nwas said as to defraying the expenses of the institution, but this was\r\ninferred by the absorption of the confiscations. If it was to be\r\ndependent on the crown the crown must provide for it, and we shall see\r\nhereafter the various devices by which a portion of the burden was\r\nsubsequently thrown upon the Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NATURE OF THE PAPAL BULL_]\r\n\r\nThe bull as finally issued bears date November 1, 1478, and is a very\r\nsimple affair which, on its face, bears no signs of its momentous\r\ninfluence in moulding the destinies of the Spanish Peninsula. After\r\nreciting the existence in Spain of false Christians and the request of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella that the pope should provide a remedy, it\r\nauthorizes them to appoint three bishops or other suitable men, priests\r\neither regular or secular, over forty years of age, masters or bachelors\r\nin theology or doctors or licentiates of canon law, and to remove and\r\nreplace them at pleasure. These are to have the jurisdiction and\r\nfaculties of bishops and inquisitors over heretics, their fautors and\r\nreceivers.[452] Subsequently Sixtus pronounced the bull to have been\r\ndrawn inconsiderately and not in accordance with received practice and\r\nthe decrees of his predecessors, which doubtless referred to the power\r\nof appointment and removal lodged in the crown and also to the omission\r\nof the requirement of episcopal concurrence in rendering judgment.[453]\r\nThe creation of inquisitors was in itself an invasion of episcopal\r\njurisdiction, which, from the earliest history of the institution, had\r\nbeen the source of frequent trouble, and where, as in Spain, many\r\nbishops were of Jewish blood and therefore under suspicion, the question\r\nwas more intricate than elsewhere. With respect to this, moreover, it is\r\nobservable that the bull did not confer, like that of Nicholas V, in\r\n1451, jurisdiction over bishops in any special derogation of the decree\r\nof Boniface VIII requiring them, when suspected of heresy, to be tried\r\nby the pope.[454] Both of these questions, as we shall see,\r\nsubsequently gave rise to considerable discussion.\r\n\r\nSo far the anti-Semitic party had triumphed, but Isabella's hesitation\r\nto exercise the powers thus obtained shows that the Conversos in her\r\ncourt did not abandon the struggle and that for nearly two years they\r\nsucceeded in keeping the balance even. It is possible also that\r\nFerdinand was not inclined to a severity of which he could forecast the\r\neconomical disadvantages, for as late as January, 1482, a letter from\r\nhim to the inquisitors of his kingdom of Valencia manifests a marked\r\npreference for the use of mild and merciful methods.[455] Whatever may\r\nhave been the influences at work, it was not until September 17, 1480,\r\nthat the momentous step was taken which was to exercise so sinister an\r\ninfluence on the destinies of Spain. On that day commissions were issued\r\nto two Dominicans, Miguel de Morillo, master of theology, and Juan de\r\nSan Martin, bachelor of theology and friar of San Pablo in Seville, who\r\nwere emphatically told that any dereliction of duty would entail their\r\nremoval, with forfeiture of all their temporalities and\r\ndenationalization in the kingdom, thus impressing upon them their\r\nsubordination to the crown. Still there were delays. October 9th a royal\r\norder commanded all officials to give them free transportation and\r\nprovisions on their way to Seville, where, as in the most infected spot,\r\noperations were to commence. When they reached the city they waited on\r\nthe chapter and presented their credentials; the municipal council met\r\nthem at the chapter-house door and escorted them to the city hall, where\r\na formal reception took place and a solemn procession was organized for\r\nthe following Sunday. They were thus fairly installed but apparently\r\nthey still found difficulties thrown in their way for, on December 27,\r\nit was deemed necessary to issue a royal cédula to the officials\r\nordering them to render all aid to the inquisitors.[456]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COMMENCEMENT AT SEVILLE_]\r\n\r\nThey had not waited for this to organize their tribunal, with Doctor\r\nJuan Ruiz de Medina as assessor and Juan Lopez del Barco, a chaplain of\r\nthe queen, as promotor fiscal or prosecuting officer. To these were\r\nadded, May 13, 1481, Diego de Merlo, assistente or corregidor of\r\nSeville, and the Licentiate Ferrand Yáñez de Lobon as receivers of\r\nconfiscations--an indispensable office in view of the profits of\r\npersecution. All soon found plenty of work. The Conversos of Seville had\r\nnot been unmindful of the coming tempest. Many of them had fled to the\r\nlands of the neighboring nobles, in the expectation that feudal\r\njurisdictions would protect them, even against a spiritual court such as\r\nthat of the Inquisition. To prevent this change of domicile a royal\r\ndecree ordered that no one should leave any place where inquisitors were\r\nholding their tribunal, but in the general terror this arbitrary command\r\nreceived scant obedience. A more efficient step was a proclamation\r\naddressed, on January 2, 1481, to the Marquis of Cadiz and other nobles\r\nby the frailes Miguel and Juan. This proved that no error had been made\r\nin the selection of those who were to lay the foundations of the\r\nInquisition and that a new era had opened for Spain. The two simple\r\nfriars spoke with an assured audacity to grandees who had been wont to\r\ntreat with their sovereigns on almost equal terms--an audacity which\r\nmust have appeared incredible to those to whom it was addressed, but to\r\nwhich Spain in time became accustomed from the Holy Office. The great\r\nRodrigo Ponce de Leon and all other nobles were commanded to search\r\ntheir territories, to seize all strangers and newcomers and to deliver\r\nthem within fifteen days at the prison of the Inquisition; to\r\nsequestrate their property and confide it, properly inventoried, to\r\ntrustworthy persons who should account for it to the king or to the\r\ninquisitors. In vigorous language they were told that any failure in\r\nobeying these orders would bring upon them excommunication removable\r\nonly by the inquisitors or their superiors, with forfeiture of rank and\r\npossessions and the release of their vassals from allegiance and from\r\nall payments due--a release which the inquisitors assumed to grant in\r\nadvance, adding that they would prosecute them as fautors, receivers and\r\ndefenders of heretics.[457] This portentous utterance was effective: the\r\nnumber of prisoners was speedily so great that the convent of San Pablo,\r\nwhich the inquisitors at first occupied, became insufficient and they\r\nobtained permission to establish themselves in the great fortress of\r\nTriana, the stronghold of Seville, of which the immense size and the\r\ngloomy dungeons rendered it appropriate for the work in hand.[458]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE FIRST AUTO DE FE_]\r\n\r\nThere were other Conversos, however, who imagined that resistance was\r\npreferable to flight. Diego de Susan, one of the leading citizens of\r\nSeville, whose wealth was estimated at ten millions of maravedís,\r\nassembled some of his prominent brethren of Seville, Utrera and Carmona\r\nto deliberate as to their action. The meeting was held in the church of\r\nSan Salvador and comprised ecclesiastics of high rank, magistrates and\r\nofficials belonging to the threatened class. Civic tumults had been so\r\ncustomary a resource, when any object was to be gained, that Susan\r\nnaturally suggested, in a fiery speech, that they should recruit\r\nfaithful men, collect a store of arms, and that the first arrest by the\r\ninquisitors should be the signal of a rising in which the inquisitors\r\nshould be slain and thus an emphatic warning be given to deter others\r\nfrom renewing the attempt. In spite of some faint-heartedness manifested\r\nby one or two of those present, the plan was adopted and steps were\r\ntaken to carry it out. When Pedro Fernández Venedera, mayordomo of the\r\ncathedral, one of the conspirators, was arrested, weapons to arm a\r\nhundred men were found in his house, showing how active were the\r\npreparations on foot. The plot would doubtless have been executed and\r\nhave led to a massacre, such as we have so often seen in the Spanish\r\ncities, but for a daughter of Diego Susan, whose loveliness had won for\r\nher the name of the _Fermosa Fembra_. She was involved in an intrigue\r\nwith a Christian caballero, to whom she revealed the secret and it was\r\nspeedily conveyed to the inquisitors.[459]\r\n\r\nNothing could better have suited their purpose. If there had been any\r\nfeeling of opposition to them on the part of the authorities it\r\ndisappeared and the most important members of the Converso community\r\nwere in their power. Diego de Merlo, the assistente of Seville, arrested\r\nat the bidding of the inquisitors the richest and most honorable\r\nConversos, magistrates and dignitaries, who were confined in San Pablo\r\nand thence transferred to the castle of Triana. The trials were prompt\r\nand at the rendering of sentence a _consulta de fe_ or assembly of\r\nexperts was convoked, consisting of lawyers and the provisor of the\r\nbishopric, thus recognizing the necessity of concurrent action on the\r\npart of the episcopal jurisdiction. What justified the sentence of\r\nburning it would be difficult to say. It was not obstinate heresy for\r\none at least of the victims is stated to have died as a good Christian;\r\nit could not have been the plot, for this, in so far as it was an\r\necclesiastical offence, was merely impeding the Inquisition, and even\r\nthe assassins of St. Peter Martyr, when they professed repentance, were\r\nadmitted to penance. It was a new departure, in disregard of all the\r\ncanons, and it gave warning that the New Inquisition of Spain was not to\r\nfollow in the footsteps of the Old, but was to mark out for itself a yet\r\nbloodier and more terrible career.[460]\r\n\r\nJustice was prompt and the first auto de fe was celebrated February 6,\r\n1481, when six men and women were burnt and the sermon was preached by\r\nFray Alonso de Hojeda, who now saw the efforts of so many years crowned\r\nwith success. He might well say _nunc demittis_, for though a second\r\nauto followed in a few days his eyes were not to rejoice at the holy\r\nspectacle, for the pestilence which was to carry off fifteen thousand of\r\nthe people of Seville was now commencing and he was one of the earliest\r\nvictims. In the second auto there were only three burnings, Diego de\r\nSusan, Manuel Sauli and Bartolomé de Torralba, three of the wealthiest\r\nand most important citizens of Seville. As though to show that the work\r\nthus begun was to be an enduring one, a _quemadero_, _brasero_, or\r\nburning-place was constructed in the Campo de Tablada, so massively that\r\nits foundations can still be traced. On four pillars at the corners were\r\nerected statues of the prophets in plaster-of-Paris, apparently to\r\nindicate that, although technically the burning was the work of secular\r\njustice, it was performed at the command of religion.[461]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE TERM OF GRACE_]\r\n\r\nFurther arrests and burnings promptly followed, the wealth and\r\nprominence of the victims proving that here was a tribunal which was no\r\nrespecter of persons and that money or favor could avail nothing against\r\nits rigid fanaticism. The flight of the terror-stricken Conversos was\r\nstimulated afresh, but the Inquisition was not thus to be balked of its\r\nprey; flight was forbidden and guards were placed at the gates, where so\r\nmany were arrested that no place of confinement sufficiently capacious\r\nfor them could be found, yet notwithstanding this great numbers escaped\r\nto the lands of the nobles, to Portugal and to the Moors. The plague now\r\nbegan to rage with violence, God and man seemed to be uniting for the\r\ndestruction of the unhappy Conversos, and they petitioned Diego de Merlo\r\nto allow them to save their lives by leaving the pest-ridden city. The\r\nrequest was humanely granted to those who could procure passes, on\r\ncondition that they should leave their property behind and only take\r\nwith them what was necessary for immediate use. Under these regulations\r\nmultitudes departed, more than eight thousand finding refuge at\r\nMairena, Marchena and Palacios. The Marquis of Cadiz, the Duke of Medina\r\nSidonia and other nobles received them hospitably, but many kept on to\r\nPortugal or to the Moors and some, we are told, even found refuge in\r\nRome. The inquisitors themselves were obliged to abandon the city, but\r\ntheir zeal allowed of no respite; they removed their tribunal to\r\nAracena, where they found ample work to do, burning there twenty-three\r\nmen and women, besides the corpses and bones of numerous deceased\r\nheretics, exhumed for the purpose. When the pestilence diminished they\r\nreturned to Seville and resumed their work there with unrelaxing\r\nardor.[462] According to a contemporary, by the fourth of November they\r\nhad burnt two hundred and ninety-eight persons and had condemned\r\nseventy-nine to perpetual prison.[463]\r\n\r\nAs novices, it would seem that the zeal of the inquisitors had plunged\r\nthem into the business of arresting and trying suspects without\r\nresorting to the preliminary device, which had been found useful in the\r\nearliest operations of the Holy Office--the Term of Grace. This was a\r\nperiod, longer or shorter according to the discretion of the\r\ninquisitors, during which those who felt themselves guilty could come\r\nforward and confess, when they would be reconciled to the Church and\r\nsubjected to penance, pecuniary and otherwise, severe enough, but\r\npreferable to the stake. One of the conditions was that of stating all\r\nthat they knew of other heretics and apostates, which proved an\r\nexceedingly fruitful source of information as, under the general terror,\r\nthere was little hesitation in denouncing not only friends and\r\nacquaintances, but the nearest and dearest kindred--parents and children\r\nand brothers and sisters. No better means of detecting the hidden\r\nramifications of Judaism could be devised and, towards the middle of the\r\nyear 1481, the inquisitors adopted it.[464] The mercy thus promised was\r\nscanty, as we shall see hereafter when we come to consider the subject,\r\nbut it brought in vast numbers and autos de fe were organized in which\r\nthey were paraded as penitents, no less than fifteen hundred being\r\nexhibited in one of these solemnities. It can readily be conceived how\r\nsoon the inquisitors were in possession of information inculpating\r\nConversos in every corner of the land. It was freely asserted that they\r\nwere all in reality Jews, who were waiting for God to lead them out of\r\nthe worse than Egyptian bondage in which they were held by the\r\nChristians.[465] Thus was demonstrated not only the necessity of the\r\nInquisition but of its extension throughout Spain. The evil was too\r\ngreat and its immediate repression too important for the work to be\r\nentrusted to the two friars laboring so zealously in Seville. Permission\r\nhad been obtained only for the appointment of three and application was\r\nmade to Sixtus IV for additional powers. On this occasion he did not as\r\nbefore allow the commissions to be granted in the name of the sovereigns\r\nbut issued them direct to those nominated to him by them, whereby the\r\ninquisitors held their faculties immediately from the Holy See. Thus by\r\na brief of February 11, 1482, he commissioned seven--Pedro Ocaño, Pedro\r\nMartínez de Barrio, Alfonso de San Cebriano, Rodrigo Segarra, Thomás de\r\nTorquemada and Bernardo Santa María, all Dominicans.[466] Still more\r\nwere required, of whose appointments we have no definite knowledge, to\r\nman the tribunals which were speedily formed at Ciudad-Real, Córdova,\r\nJaen, and possibly at Segovia.[466a]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CIUDAD-REAL AND TOLEDO_]\r\n\r\nThe one at Ciudad-Real was intended for the great archiepiscopal\r\nprovince of Toledo, to which city it was transferred in 1485. The reason\r\nwhy it was first established at the former place may perhaps be that the\r\nwarlike Archbishop Alonso Carrillo, whether through zeal for the faith\r\nor in order to assert his episcopal jurisdiction over heresy and prevent\r\nthe intrusion of the papal inquisitors, had appointed before his death,\r\nJuly 1, 1482, a certain Doctor Thomás as inquisitor in Toledo. To what\r\nextent the latter performed his functions we have no means of knowing,\r\nthe only trace of his activity being the production and incorporation,\r\nin the records of subsequent trials by the Inquisition of Ciudad-Real,\r\nof evidence taken by him.[467] Be this as it may the Inquisition of\r\nCiudad-Real was not organized until the latter half of 1483. It\r\ncommenced by issuing an Edict of Grace for thirty days, at the\r\nexpiration of which it extended the time for another thirty days.\r\nMeanwhile it was busily employed, throughout October and November, in\r\nmaking a general inquest and taking testimony from all who would come\r\nforward to give evidence. In the resultant trials the names of some of\r\nthe witnesses appear with suspicious frequency and the nature of their\r\nreckless general assertions, without personal knowledge, shows how\r\nflimsy was much of the evidence on which prosecutions were based. That\r\nthe inquest was thorough and that every one who knew anything damaging\r\nto a Converso was brought up to state it may be assumed from the trial\r\nof Sancho de Ciudad in which the evidence of no less than thirty-four\r\nwitnesses was recorded, some of them testifying to incidents happening\r\ntwenty years previous. Much of this moreover indicates the careless\r\nsecurity in which the Conversos had lived and allowed their Jewish\r\npractices to be known to Christian servants and acquaintances with whom\r\nthey were in constant intercourse. The first public manifestation of\r\nresults seems to have been an auto de fe held November 16th, in the\r\nchurch of San Pedro, for the reconciliation of penitents who had come\r\nforward during the Term of Grace.[468] Soon after this the trials of\r\nthose implicated commenced and were prosecuted with such vigor that, on\r\nFebruary 6, 1484, an auto de fe was held in which four persons were\r\nburnt, followed on the 23d and 24th of the same month by an imposing\r\nsolemnity involving the concremation of thirty living men and women and\r\nthe bones and effigies of forty who were dead or fugitives.[469] In its\r\ntwo years of existence the tribunal of Ciudad-Real burnt fifty-two\r\nobstinate heretics, condemned two hundred and twenty fugitives and\r\nreconciled one hundred and eighty-three penitents.[470]\r\n\r\nIn 1485 the tribunal of Ciudad-Real was transferred to the city of\r\nToledo where the Conversos were very numerous and wealthy. They\r\norganized a plot to raise a tumult and despatch the inquisitors during\r\nthe procession of Corpus Christi (June 2d) but, as in the case of\r\nSeville, it was betrayed and six of the conspirators were hanged, after\r\nwhich we hear of no further trouble there. Those who were first arrested\r\nconfessed that the design extended to seizing the city gates and\r\ncathedral tower and holding the place against the sovereigns.[471]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PENITENTS IN TOLEDO_]\r\n\r\nThe inquisitor, Pedro Díaz, had preached the first sermon on May 24th,\r\nand, after the defeat of the conspiracy, the tribunal entered vigorously\r\non its functions. The customary Term of Grace of forty days was\r\nproclaimed and after some delay we are told that many applied for\r\nreconciliation rather through fear of concremation than through good\r\nwill. After the expiration of the forty days, letters of excommunication\r\nwere published against all cognizant of heresy who should not denounce\r\nit within sixty days--a term subsequently extended by thirty more.\r\nAnother very effectual expedient was adopted by summoning the Jewish\r\nrabbis and requiring them, under penalty of life and property, to place\r\na major excommunication on their synagogues and not remove it until all\r\nthe members should have revealed everything within their knowledge\r\nrespecting Judaizing Christians. This was only perfecting a device that\r\nhad already been employed elsewhere. In 1484, by a cédula of December\r\n10th, Ferdinand had ordered the magistrates of all the principal towns\r\nin Aragon to compel, by all methods recognized in law, the rabbis and\r\nsacristans of the synagogues and such other Jews as might be named, to\r\ntell the truth as to all that might be asked of them, and in Seville we\r\nare told that a prominent Jew, Judah Ibn-Verga, expatriated himself to\r\navoid compliance with a similar demand. The quality of the evidence\r\nobtained by such means may be estimated from the fact that when, in the\r\nassembly of Valladolid, in 1488, Ferdinand and Isabella investigated the\r\naffairs of the Inquisition, it was found that many Jews testified\r\nfalsely against Conversos in order to encompass their ruin, for which\r\nsome of those against which this was proved were lapidated in Toledo.\r\nWhether true or false, the Toledan Inquisition reaped by these methods a\r\nplentiful harvest of important revelations. It is easy, in fact, to\r\nimagine the terror pervading the Converso community and the eagerness\r\nwith which the unfortunates would come forward to denounce themselves\r\nand their kindred and friends, especially when, after the expiration of\r\nthe ninety days, arrests began and quickly followed each other.[472]\r\n\r\nThe penitents were allowed to accumulate and at the first auto de fe,\r\nheld February 12, 1486, only those of seven parishes--San Vicente, San\r\nNicolás, San Juan de la leche, Santa Yusta, San Miguel, San Yuste, and\r\nSan Lorenzo--were summoned to appear. These amounted to seven hundred\r\nand fifty of both sexes, comprising many of the principal citizens and\r\npersons of quality. The ceremony was painful and humiliating. Bareheaded\r\nand barefooted, except that, in consideration of the intense cold, they\r\nwere allowed to wear soles, carrying unlighted candles and surrounded by\r\na howling mob which had gathered from all the country around, they were\r\nmarched in procession through the city to the cathedral, at the portal\r\nof which stood two priests who marked them on the forehead as they\r\nentered with the sign of the cross, saying \"Receive the sign of the\r\ncross which you have denied and lost.\" When inside they were called one\r\nby one before the inquisitors while a statement of their misdeeds was\r\nread. They were fined in one-fifth of all their property for the war\r\nwith the Moors; they were subjected to lifelong incapacity to hold\r\noffice or to pursue honorable avocations or to wear other than the\r\ncoarsest vestments unadorned, under pain of burning for relapse, and\r\nthey were required to march in procession on six Fridays, bareheaded and\r\nbarefooted, disciplining themselves with hempen cords.[473] The loving\r\nmother Church could not welcome back to her bosom her erring children\r\nwithout a sharp and wholesome warning, nor did she relax her vigilance,\r\nfor this perilous process of confession and reconciliation was so\r\ndevised as to furnish many subsequent victims to the stake, as we shall\r\nsee hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe second auto was held on April 2, 1486, where nine hundred penitents\r\nappeared from the parishes of San Roman, San Salvador, San Cristóval,\r\nSan Zoil, Sant Andrés and San Pedro. The third auto, on June 11th,\r\nconsisted of some seven hundred and fifty from Santa Olalla, San Tomás,\r\nSan Martin and Sant Antolin. The city being thus disposed of, the\r\nvarious archidiaconates of the district were taken in order. That of\r\nToledo furnished nine hundred penitents on December 10th, when we are\r\ntold that they suffered greatly from the cold. On January 15, 1487,\r\nthere were about seven hundred from the archidiaconate of Alcaraz and on\r\nMarch 10th, from those of Talavera, Madrid and Guadalajara about twelve\r\nhundred, some of whom were condemned in addition to wear the sanbenito\r\nfor life. While the more or less voluntary penitents were thus treated\r\nthere were numerous autos de fe celebrated of a more serious character\r\nin which there were a good many burnings, including not a few _frailes_\r\nand ecclesiastical dignitaries, as well as cases of fugitives and of the\r\ndead, who were burned in effigy and their estates confiscated.[474]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TRIBUNAL OF GUADALUPE_]\r\n\r\nIn 1485 a temporary tribunal was set up at Guadalupe, where Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella appointed as inquisitor (under what papal authority does\r\nnot appear) Fray Nuño de Arevalo, prior of the Geronimite convent there.\r\nApparently to guide his inexperience Doctor Francisco de la Fuente was\r\ntransferred from Ciudad-Real and, with another colleague, the Licentiate\r\nPedro Sánchez de la Calancha, they purified the place of heresy with so\r\nmuch vigor that, within a year, they held in the cemetery before the\r\ndoors of the monastery seven autos de fe in which were burnt a heretic\r\nmonk, fifty-two Judaizers, forty-eight dead bodies and twenty-five\r\neffigies of fugitives, while sixteen were condemned to perpetual\r\nimprisonment and innumerable others were sent to the galleys or penanced\r\nwith the _sanbenito_ for life. These energetic proceedings do not appear\r\nto have made good Christians of those who were spared for, July 13,\r\n1500, Inquisitor-general Deza ordered all the Conversos of Guadalupe to\r\nleave the district and not to return.[475] The same year, 1485, saw a\r\ntribunal assigned to Valladolid, but it must have met with effective\r\nresistance, for in September, 1488, Ferdinand and Isabella were obliged\r\nto visit the city in order to get it into working condition; it\r\nforthwith commenced operations by arresting some prominent citizens and\r\non June 19, 1489, the first auto de fe was held in which eighteen\r\npersons were burnt alive and the bones of four dead heretics.[476]\r\nStill, the existence of this tribunal would seem to have long remained\r\nuncertain for, as late as December 24, 1498, we find Isabella writing to\r\na new appointee that she and the inquisitor-general have agreed that the\r\nInquisition must be placed there and ordering him to prepare to\r\nundertake it, and then on January 22, 1501, telling Inquisitor-general\r\nDeza that she approves of its lodgement in the house of Diego de la\r\nBaeza, where it is to remain for the present; she adds that she and\r\nFerdinand have written to the Count of Cabra to see that for the future\r\nthe inquisitors are well treated.[477] Permanent tribunals were also\r\nestablished in Llerena and Murcia, of the early records of all of which\r\nwe know little. In 1490 a temporary one was organized in Avila by\r\nTorquemada, apparently for the purpose of trying those accused of the\r\nmurder of the Santo Niño de la Guardia; it continued active until 1500\r\nand during these ten years there were hung in the church the _insignias\r\ny mantetas_ of seventy-five victims burnt alive, of twenty-six dead and\r\nof one fugitive, besides the sanbenitos of seventy-one reconciled\r\npenitents.[478]\r\n\r\nThe various provinces of Castile thus became provided with the machinery\r\nrequisite for the extermination of heresy, and at an early period in its\r\ndevelopment it was seen that, for the enormous work before it, some more\r\ncompact and centralized organization was desirable than had hitherto\r\nbeen devised. The Inquisition which had been so effective in the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries was scattered over Europe; its\r\njudges were appointed by the Dominican or Franciscan provincials, using\r\na course of procedure and obeying instructions which emanated from the\r\nHoly See. The papacy was the only link between them; the individual\r\ninquisitors were to a great extent independent; they were not subjected\r\nto visitation or inspection and it was, if not impossible, a matter of\r\ndifficulty to call them to account for the manner in which they might\r\ndischarge their functions. Such was not the conception of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella who intended the Spanish Inquisition to be a national\r\ninstitution, strongly organized and owing obedience to the crown much\r\nmore than to the Holy See. The measures which they adopted with this\r\nobject were conceived with their customary sagacity, and were carried\r\nout with their usual vigor and success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ORGANIZATION_]\r\n\r\nAt this period they were earnestly engaged in reorganizing the\r\ninstitutions of Castile, centralizing the administration and reducing to\r\norder the chaos resulting from the virtual anarchy of the preceding\r\nreigns. In effecting this they apportioned, in 1480, with the consent of\r\nthe Córtes of Toledo, the affairs of government among four royal\r\ncouncils, that of administration and justice, known as the Concejo Real\r\nde Castella, that of Finance, or Concejo de Hacienda, the Concejo de\r\nEstado and the Concejo de Aragon, to which was added a special one for\r\nthe Hermandades.[479] These met daily in the palace for the despatch of\r\nbusiness and their effect in making the royal power felt in every\r\nquarter of the land and in giving vigor and unity to the management of\r\nthe state soon proved the practical value of the device. The Inquisition\r\nwas fast looming up as an affair of state of the first importance, while\r\nyet it could scarce be regarded as falling within the scope of either of\r\nthe four councils; the sovereigns were too jealous of papal interference\r\nto allow it to drift aimlessly, subject to directions from Rome, and\r\ntheir uniform policy required that it should be kept as much as possible\r\nunder the royal superintendence. That a fifth council should be created\r\nfor the purpose was a natural expedient, for which the assent of Sixtus\r\nIV was readily obtained, when it was organized in 1483 under the name of\r\nthe _Concejo de la Suprema y General Inquisicion_--a title conveniently\r\nabbreviated to _la Suprema_--with jurisdiction over all matters\r\nconnected with the faith. To secure due subordination and discipline\r\nover the whole body it was requisite that the president of this council\r\nshould have full control of appointment and dismissal of the individual\r\ninquisitors who, as exercising power delegated directly from the pope,\r\nmight otherwise regard with contempt the authority of one who was also\r\nmerely a delegate. It thus became necessary to create a new office,\r\nunknown to the older Inquisition--an inquisitor-general who should\r\npreside over the deliberations of the council. The office evidently was\r\none which would be of immense weight and the future of the institution\r\ndepended greatly on the character of its first chief. By the advice of\r\nthe Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo, Pero González de Mendoza, the royal\r\nchoice fell on Thomas de Torqemada, the confessor of the sovereigns, who\r\nwas one of the seven inquisitors commissioned by the papal letter of\r\nFebruary 11, 1482. The other members of the council were Alonso\r\nCarrillo, Bishop of Mazara (Sicily) and two doctors of laws, Sancho\r\nVelasco de Cuellar and Ponce de Valencia.[480] The exact date of\r\nTorquemada's appointment is not known, as the papal brief conferring it\r\nhas not been found, but, as Sixtus created him Inquisitor of Aragon,\r\nCatalonia and Valencia by letters of October 17, 1483, his commission as\r\nInquisitor-general of Castile was somewhat antecedent.[481]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TORQUEMADA_]\r\n\r\nThe selection of Torquemada justified the wisdom of the sovereigns. Full\r\nof pitiless zeal, he developed the nascent institution with unwearied\r\nassiduity. Rigid and unbending, he would listen to no compromise of what\r\nhe deemed to be his duty, and in his sphere he personified the union of\r\nthe spiritual and temporal swords which was the ideal of all true\r\nchurchmen. Under his guidance the Inquisition rapidly took shape and\r\nextended its organization throughout Spain and was untiring and\r\nremorseless in the pursuit and punishment of the apostates. His labors\r\nwon him ample praise from successive popes. Already, in 1484, Sixtus IV\r\nwrote to him that Cardinal Borgia had warmly eulogized him for his\r\nsuccess in prosecuting the good work throughout Castile and Leon, adding\r\n\"We have heard this with the greatest pleasure and rejoice exceedingly\r\nthat you, who are furnished with both doctrine and authority, have\r\ndirected your zeal to these matters which contribute to the praise of\r\nGod and the utility of the orthodox faith. We commend you in the Lord\r\nand exhort you, cherished son, to persevere with tireless zeal in aiding\r\nand promoting the cause of the faith, by doing which, as we are assured\r\nyou will, you will win our special favor.\" Twelve years later, Cardinal\r\nBorgia, then pope under the name of Alexander VI, assures him in 1496,\r\nthat he cherishes him in the very bowels of affection for his immense\r\nlabors in the exaltation of the faith.[482] If we cannot wholly\r\nattribute to him the spirit of ruthless fanaticism which animated the\r\nInquisition, he at least deserves the credit of stimulating and\r\nrendering it efficient in its work by organizing it and by directing it\r\nwith dauntless courage against the suspect however high-placed, until\r\nthe shadow of the Holy Office covered the land and no one was so hardy\r\nas not to tremble at its name. The temper in which he discharged his\r\nduties and the absolute and irresponsible control which he exercised\r\nover the subordinate tribunals can be fitly estimated from a single\r\ninstance. There was a fully organized Inquisition at Medina, with three\r\ninquisitors, an assessor, a fiscal and other officials, assisted by the\r\nAbbot of Medina as Ordinary. They reconciled some culprits and burnt\r\nothers, apparently without referring the cases to him, but when they\r\nfound reason to acquit some prisoners they deemed it best to transmit\r\nthe papers to him for confirmation. He demurred at this mercy and told\r\nthe tribunal to try the accused again when the Licentiate Villalpando\r\nshould be there as _visitador_. Some months later Villalpando came\r\nthere, the cases were reviewed, the prisoners were tortured, two of them\r\nwere reconciled and the rest acquitted, the sentences being duly\r\npublished as final. Torquemada on learning this was incensed and\r\ndeclared that he would burn them all. He had them arrested again and\r\nsent to Valladolid, to be tried outside of their district, where his\r\nthreat was doubtless carried into effect.[483] When such was the spirit\r\ninfused in the organization at the beginning we need not wonder that\r\nverdicts of acquittal are infrequent in the records of its development.\r\nYet withal Torquemada's zeal could not wholly extinguish worldliness. We\r\nare told, indeed, that he refused the archbishopric of Seville, that he\r\nwore the humble Dominican habit, that he never tasted flesh nor wore\r\nlinen in his garments or used it on his bed, and that he refused to give\r\na marriage-portion to his indigent sister, whom he would only assist to\r\nenter the order of _beatas_ of St. Dominic. Still, his asceticism did\r\nnot prevent him from living in palaces surrounded by a princely retinue\r\nof two hundred and fifty armed familiars and fifty horsemen.[484] Nor\r\nwas his persecuting career purely disinterested. Though the rule of his\r\nDominican Order forbade individual ownership of property and, though his\r\nposition as supreme judge should have dictated the utmost reserve in\r\nregard to the financial results of persecution, he had no hesitation in\r\naccumulating large sums from the pecuniary penances inflicted by his\r\nsubordinates on the heretics who spontaneously returned to the\r\nfaith.[485] It is true that the standards of the age were so low that he\r\nmade no secret of this and it is also true that he lavished them on the\r\nsplendid monastery of St. Thomas Aquinas which he built at Avila, on\r\nenlarging that of Santa Cruz at Segovia of which he was prior and on\r\nvarious structures in his native town of Torquemada. Yet amid the\r\nostentation of his expenditure he lived in perpetual fear, and at his\r\ntable he always used the horn of a unicorn which was a sovereign\r\npreservative against poison.[486]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INTERNAL QUARRELS_]\r\n\r\nAs delegated powers were held to expire with the death of the grantor,\r\nunless otherwise expressly defined, Torquemada's commission required\r\nrenewal on the decease of Sixtus IV. Ferdinand and Isabella asked that\r\nthe new one should not be limited to the life of the pope, but that the\r\npower should continue, not only during Torquemada's life, but until the\r\nappointment of his successor.[487] The request was not granted and, when\r\nInnocent VIII, by a brief of February 3, 1485, recommissioned Torquemada\r\nit was in the ordinary form. This apparently was not satisfactory, but\r\nthe pope was not willing thus to lose all control of the Spanish\r\nInquisition and a compromise seems to have been reached, for when,\r\nFebruary 6, 1486, Torquemada was appointed Inquisitor-general of\r\nBarcelona and his commission for Spain was renewed, on March 24th of the\r\nsame year, it was drawn to continue at the good pleasure of the pope and\r\nof the Holy See, which, without abnegating papal control, rendered\r\nrenewals unnecessary.[488] This formula was abandoned in the commissions\r\nof Torquemada's immediate successors, but was subsequently resumed and\r\ncontinued to be employed through the following centuries.[489]\r\n\r\nTorquemada's commission of 1485 contained the important power of\r\nappointing and dismissing inquisitors, but the confirmation of 1486 bore\r\nthe significant exception that all those appointed by the pope were\r\nexempted from removal by him, indicating that in the interval he had\r\nattempted to exercise the power and that the resistance to it had\r\nenlisted papal support. In fact, at the conference of Seville, held in\r\n1484 by Torquemada, there were present the two inquisitors of each of\r\nfour existing tribunals; from Seville we find Juan de San Martin, one of\r\nthe original appointees of 1479, but his colleague, Miguel de Morillo,\r\nhas disappeared and is replaced by Juan Ruiz de Medina, who had been\r\nmerely assessor, while but a single one, Pero Martínez de Barrio, of the\r\nseven commissioned by Sixtus IV in 1482 appears as representing the\r\nother tribunals--the rest are all new men, doubtless appointees of\r\nTorquemada.[490] There was evidently a bitter quarrel on foot between\r\nTorquemada and the original papal nominees, who held that their powers,\r\ndelegated directly from the pope, rendered them independent of him, and,\r\nas usual, the Holy See inclined to one side or to the other in the most\r\nexasperating manner, as opposing interests brought influence to bear.\r\nComplaints against Torquemada were sufficiently numerous and serious to\r\noblige him thrice to send Fray Alonso Valaja to the papal court to\r\njustify him.[491] He seems to have removed Miguel de Morillo, who\r\nvindicated himself in Rome, for a brief of Innocent VIII, February 23,\r\n1487, appoints him inquisitor of Seville, in complete disregard of the\r\nfaculties granted to Torquemada. Then a _motu proprio_ of November 26,\r\n1487, suspends both him and Juan de San Martin and commissions\r\nTorquemada to appoint their successors. Again, a brief of January 7,\r\n1488, appoints Juan Inquisitor of Seville, while subsequent briefs of\r\nthe same year are addressed to him concerning the business of his office\r\nas though he were discharging its duties independently of Torquemada,\r\nbut his death in 1489 removed him from the scene. The quarrel evidently\r\ncontinued, and at one time Fray Miguel enjoyed a momentary triumph, for\r\na papal letter of September 26, 1491, commissions him as\r\nInquisitor-general of Castile and Aragon, thus placing him on an\r\nequality with Torquemada himself.[492] It would be impossible now to\r\ndetermine what part the sovereigns may have had in these changes and to\r\nwhat extent the popes disregarded the authority conferred on them of\r\nappointment and removal. There was a constant struggle on the one hand\r\nto render the Spanish Holy Office national and independent, and on the\r\nother to keep it subject to papal control.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FIVE INQUISITORS GENERAL_]\r\n\r\nFinally the opposition to Torquemada became so strong that Alexander VI,\r\nin 1494, kindly alleging his great age and infirmities, commissioned\r\nMartin Ponce de Leon, Archbishop of Messina, but resident in Spain,\r\nIñigo Manrique, Bishop of Córdova, Francisco Sánchez de la Fuente,\r\nBishop of Avila, and Alonso Suárez de Fuentelsaz, Bishop of Mondonego\r\nand successively of Lugo and Jaen, as inquisitors-general with the same\r\npowers as Torquemada; each was independent and could act by himself and\r\ncould even terminate cases commenced by another.[493] It is quite\r\nprobable that, to spare his feelings, he was allowed to name his\r\ncolleagues as delegates of his powers, for in some instructions issued,\r\nin 1494, by Martin of Messina and Francisco of Avila they describe\r\nthemselves as inquisitors-general in all the Spanish realms subdelegated\r\nby the Inquisitor-general Torquemada.[494] He evidently still retained\r\nhis pre-eminence and was active to the last, for we have letters from\r\nFerdinand to him in the first half of 1498 concerning the current\r\naffairs of the Inquisition, in which the Bishop of Lugo declined to\r\ninterfere with him. The Instructions of Avila, in 1498, were issued in\r\nhis name as inquisitor-general, and the assertion that he resigned two\r\nyears before his death, September 16, 1498, is evidently incorrect.[495]\r\nIn some respects, however, the Bishop of Avila had special functions\r\nwhich distinguished him from his colleagues, for he was appointed by\r\nAlexander VI, November 4, 1494, judge of appeals in all matters of faith\r\nand March 30, 1495, he received special faculties to degrade\r\necclesiastics condemned by the Inquisition, or to appoint other bishops\r\nfor that function.[496] So long as they were in orders clerics were\r\nexempt from secular jurisdiction and it was necessary to degrade them\r\nbefore they could be delivered to the civil authorities for burning.\r\nUnder the canons, this had to be done by their own bishops, who were not\r\nalways at hand for the purpose, and who apparently, when present,\r\nsometimes refused or delayed to perform the office, which was a serious\r\nimpediment to the business of the Inquisition, as many Judaizing\r\nConversos were found among clerics.\r\n\r\nThis multiform headship of the Inquisition continued for some years\r\nuntil the various incumbents successively died or resigned. Iñigo\r\nManrique was the first to disappear, dying in 1496, and had no\r\nsuccessor. Then, in 1498, followed the Bishop of Avila, who had been\r\ntransferred to Córdova in 1496. In the same year, as we have seen,\r\nTorquemada died, and this time the vacancy was filled by the appointment\r\nas his successor of Diego Deza, then Bishop of Jaen (subsequently, in\r\n1500, of Palencia, and in 1505 Archbishop of Seville) who was\r\ncommissioned, November 24, 1498, for Castile, Leon and Granada, and on\r\nSeptember 1, 1499, for all the Spanish kingdoms.[497] In 1500 died\r\nMartin Archbishop of Messina--apparently a defaulter, for, on October\r\n26th of the same year, Ferdinand orders his auditor of the confiscations\r\nto pass in the accounts of Luis de Riva Martin, receiver of Cadiz,\r\n18,000 maravedís due by the archbishop for wheat, hay, etc., which he\r\nforgives to the heirs.[498] From this time forward Deza is reckoned as\r\nthe sole inquisitor-general and direct successor of Torquemada, but\r\nFuentelsaz, Bishop of Jaen, remained in office, for, as late as January\r\n13, 1503, an order for the payment of salaries is signed by Deza and\r\ncontains the name of the Bishop of Jaen as also inquisitor-general.[499]\r\nHe relinquished the position in 1504 and Deza remained as sole chief of\r\nthe Inquisition until, in 1507, he was forced to resign as we shall see\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _IT FRAMES ITS OWN RULES_]\r\n\r\nAt the time of his retirement the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon had\r\nbeen separated by the death of Isabella, November 26, 1504. Ferdinand's\r\nexperience with his son-in-law, Philip I, and his hope of issue from his\r\nmarriage in March, 1506, with Germaine de Foix, in which case the\r\nkingdoms would have remained separate, warned him of the danger of\r\nhaving his ancestral dominions spiritually subordinated to a Castilian\r\nsubject. Before Deza's resignation, therefore, he applied to Julius II\r\nto commission Juan Enguera, Bishop of Vich, with the powers for Aragon\r\nwhich Deza was exercising. Julius seems to have made some difficulty\r\nabout this, for a letter of Ferdinand, from Naples, February 6, 1507, to\r\nhis ambassador at Rome, Francisco de Rojas, instructs him to explain\r\nthat, since he had abandoned the title of King of Castile, the\r\njurisdiction was separated and it was necessary and convenient that\r\nthere should be an Inquisition for each kingdom.[500] He prevailed and\r\nthe appointments of Cardinal Ximenes for Castile and of Bishop Enguera\r\nfor Aragon were issued respectively on June 6 and 5, 1507.[501] During\r\nthe lifetime of Ximenes the Inquisitions remained disunited, but in\r\n1518, after his death, Charles V caused his former tutor, Cardinal\r\nAdrian of Utrecht, Bishop of Tortosa, who in 1516 had been made\r\nInquisitor-general of Aragon, to be commissioned also for Castile, after\r\nwhich there was no further division. During the interval Ferdinand had\r\nacquired Navarre and had annexed it to the crown of Castile, so that the\r\nwhole of the Peninsula, with the exception of Portugal, was united under\r\none organization.[502]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong other powers granted to Torquemada was that of modifying the rules\r\nof the Inquisition to adapt them to the requirements of Spain.[503] The\r\nimportance of this concession it would be difficult to exaggerate, as it\r\nrendered the institution virtually self-governing. Thus the Spanish\r\nInquisition acquired a character of its own, distinguishing it from the\r\nmoribund tribunals of the period in other lands. The men who fashioned\r\nit knew perfectly what they wanted and in their hands it assumed the\r\nshape in which it dominated the conscience of every man and was an\r\nobject of terror to the whole population. In the exercise of this power\r\nTorquemada assembled the inquisitors in Seville, November 29, 1484,\r\nwhere, in conjunction with his colleagues of the Suprema, a series of\r\nregulations was agreed upon, known as the _Instruciones de Sevilla_, to\r\nwhich, in December of the same year and in January, 1485, he added\r\nfurther rules, issued in his own name under the authority of the\r\nsovereigns. In 1488 another assembly was held, under the supervision of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, which issued the _Instruciones de\r\nValladolid_.[504] In 1498 came the _Instruciones de Avila_--the last in\r\nwhich Torquemada took part--designed principally to check the abuses\r\nwhich were rapidly developing, and, for the same purpose, a brief\r\naddition was made at Seville in 1500, by Diego Deza. All these became\r\nknown in the tribunals as the _Instruciones Antiguas_.[505] As the\r\ninstitution became thoroughly organized under the control of the\r\nSuprema, consultation with the subordinate inquisitors was no longer\r\nrequisite and regulations were promulgated by it in _cartas acordadas_.\r\nIt was difficult, however, to keep the inquisitors strictly in line, and\r\nvariations of practice sprang up which, in 1561, the Inquisitor-general\r\nFernando Valdés endeavored to check by issuing the _Instruciones\r\nNuevas_. Subsequent regulations were required from time to time, forming\r\na considerable and somewhat intricate body of jurisprudence, which we\r\nshall have to consider hereafter. At present it is sufficient to\r\nindicate how the Inquisition became an autonomous body--an _imperium in\r\nimperio_--framing its own laws and subject only to the rarely-exercised\r\nauthority of the Holy See and the more or less hesitating control of the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FLIGHT OF NEW CHRISTIANS_]\r\n\r\nAt the same time all the resources of the State were placed at its\r\ndisposal. When an inquisitor came to assume his functions the officials\r\ntook an oath to assist him, to exterminate all whom he might designate\r\nas heretics and to observe and compel the observance by all of the\r\ndecretals _Ad abolendum_, _Excommunicamus_, _Ut officium Inquisitionis_\r\nand _Ut Inquisitionis negotium_--the papal legislation of the thirteenth\r\ncentury which made the state wholly subservient to the Holy Office and\r\nrendered incapable of official position any one suspect in the faith or\r\nwho favored heretics.[506] Besides this, all the population was\r\nassembled to listen to a sermon by the inquisitor, after which all were\r\nrequired to swear on the cross and the gospels to help the Holy Office\r\nand not to impede it in any manner or on any pretext.[507]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _GENERAL SUBMISSION_]\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that, as this portentous institution spread its wings of\r\nterror over the land, all who felt themselves liable to its\r\nanimadversion were disposed to seek safety in flight, no matter at what\r\nsacrifice. That numbers succeeded in this is shown by the statistics of\r\nthe early autos de fe, in which the living victims are far outnumbered\r\nby the effigies of the absent. Thus in Ciudad-Real, during the first two\r\nyears, fifty-two obstinate heretics were burnt and two hundred and\r\ntwenty absentees were condemned.[508] In Barcelona, where the\r\nInquisition was not established until 1487, the first auto de fe,\r\ncelebrated January 25, 1488, showed a list of four living victims to\r\ntwelve effigies of fugitives; in a subsequent one of May 23d, the\r\nproportions were three to forty-two; in one of February 9, 1489, three\r\nto thirty-nine; in one of March 24, 1490, they were two to one hundred\r\nand fifty-nine, and in another of June 10, 1491, they were three to one\r\nhundred and thirty-nine.[509] If the object had simply been to purify\r\nthe land of heresy and apostasy this would have been accomplished as\r\nwell by expatriation as by burning or reconciling, but such was not the\r\npolicy which governed the sovereigns, and edicts were issued forbidding\r\nall of Jewish lineage from leaving Spain and imposing a fine of five\r\nhundred florins on ship-masters conveying them away.[510] This was not,\r\nas it might seem to us, wanton cruelty, although it was harsh, inasmuch\r\nas it assumed guilt on mere suspicion. To say nothing of the\r\nconfiscations, which were defrauded of the portable property carried\r\naway by the fugitives, we must bear in mind that, to the orthodox of the\r\nperiod, heresy was a positive crime, nay the greatest of crimes,\r\npunishable as such by laws in force for centuries, and the heretic was\r\nto be prevented from escaping its penalties as much as a murderer or a\r\nthief. The royal edicts were supplemented by the Inquisition, and it is\r\nan illustration of the extension of its jurisdiction over all matters,\r\nrelating directly or indirectly to the faith, that, November 8, 1499,\r\nthe Archbishop Martin of Messina issued an order, which was published\r\nthroughout the realm and was confirmed by Diego Deza, January 15, 1502,\r\nto the effect that no ship-captain or merchant should transport across\r\nseas any New Christian, whether Jewish or Moorish, without a royal\r\nlicense, under pain of confiscation, of excommunication and of being\r\nheld as a fautor and protector of heretics. To render this effective two\r\ndays later Archbishop Martin ordered that suitable persons should be\r\nsent to all the sea-ports to arrest all New Christians desiring to cross\r\nthe sea and bring them to the Inquisition so that justice should be done\r\nto them, all expenses being defrayed out of the confiscations.[511]\r\nThese provisions were not allowed to be a dead-letter, though we are apt\r\nto hear of them rather in cases where, for special reasons, the\r\npenalties were remitted. Thus, July 24, 1499, Ferdinand writes to the\r\nInquisitors of Barcelona that a ship of Charles de Sant Climent, a\r\nmerchant of their city, had brought from Alexandria to Aiguesmortes\r\ncertain persons who had fled from Spain. Even this transportation\r\nbetween foreign ports came within the purview of the law, for Ferdinand\r\nexplains that action in this case would be to his disservice, wherefore\r\nif complaint is lodged with them they are to refer it to him or to the\r\ninquisitor-general for instructions. Again, on November 8, 1500, the\r\nking orders the release of the caravel and other property of Diego de la\r\nMesquita of Seville, which had been seized because he had carried some\r\nNew Christians to Naples--the reason for the release being the services\r\nof Diego in the war with Naples and those which he is rendering\r\nelsewhere. A letter from Ferdinand to the King of Portugal, November 7,\r\n1500, recites that recently some New Christians had been arrested in\r\nMilaga, where they were embarking under pretext of going to Rome for the\r\njubilee. On examination by the Inquisition at Seville they admitted that\r\nthey were Jews but said that they had been forced in Portugal to turn\r\nChristians; as this brought them under inquisitorial jurisdiction, the\r\ninquisitors were sending to Portugal for evidence and the king was asked\r\nto protect the envoys and give them facilities for the purpose.[512] The\r\nsame determination was manifested to recapture when possible those who\r\nhad succeeded in effecting their flight. In 1496 Micer Martin,\r\ninquisitor of Mallorca, heard of some who were in Bugia, a sea-port of\r\nAfrica. He forthwith despatched the notary, Lope de Vergara, thither to\r\nseize them, but the misbelieving Moors disregarded his safe-conduct and\r\nthrew him and his party into a dungeon where they languished for three\r\nyears. He at length was ransomed and, in recompense of his losses and\r\nsufferings, Ferdinand ordered, March 31, 1499, Matheo de Morrano\r\nreceiver of Mallorca to pay him two hundred and fifty gold ducats\r\nwithout requiring of him any itemized statement of his injuries.[513]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REPRESSION OF ABUSES_]\r\n\r\nIt shows how strong an impression had already been made by the resolute\r\ncharacter of the sovereigns, and how violent was the antagonism\r\ngenerally entertained for the Conversos, that so novel and absolute a\r\ntyranny could be imposed on the lately turbulent population of Castile\r\nwithout resistance, and that so powerful a class as that against which\r\npersecution was directed should have submitted without an effort save\r\nthe abortive plots at Seville and Toledo. The indications that have\r\nreached us of opposition to the arbitrary acts of the Inquisition in\r\nmaking arrests or confiscations are singularly few. In the records of\r\nthe town-council of Xeres de la Frontera, under date of August 28, 1482,\r\nthere is an entry reciting that there had come to the town a man\r\ncarrying a wand and calling himself an alguazil of the Inquisition; he\r\nhad seized Gonçalo Caçabé and carried him off without showing his\r\nauthority to the local officials, which was characterized as an\r\natrocious proceeding and the town ought to take steps with the king,\r\nthe pope and the Inquisition to have it undone.[514] Doubtless the\r\nsummary acts of the Holy Office over-riding all recognized law, created\r\nsuch feeling in many places as we may gather from a cédula of Ferdinand,\r\nDecember 15, 1484, forbidding the reception of heretics and ordering\r\ntheir surrender on demand of the inquisitors, and another of July 8,\r\n1487, commanding that any one bearing orders from the inquisitors of\r\nToledo is to be allowed to arrest any person, under a penalty of 100,000\r\nmaravedís for the rich and confiscation for others,[515] but complaints\r\nwere dangerous, for they could be met by threats of punishment for\r\nfautorship of heresy. Still it required considerable time to accustom\r\nthe nobles and people to unquestioning submission to a domination so\r\nabsolute and so foreign to their experience. As late as the year 1500\r\nthere are two royal letters to the Count of Benalcázar reciting that he\r\nhad ordered the arrest of a girl of Herrera who had uttered scandals\r\nagainst the faith; she was in the hands of his alcaide, Gutierre de\r\nSotomayor, who refused to deliver her when the inquisitor sent for her.\r\nThe second letter, after an interval of nineteen days, points out the\r\ngravity of the offence and peremptorily orders the surrender of the\r\ngirl. She proved to be a Jewish prophetess whose trial resulted in\r\nbringing to the stake large numbers of her unfortunate disciples. There\r\nis also an anticipation of resistance in a letter, January 12, 1501, to\r\nthe Prior of St. John, charging him to see that no impediments are\r\nplaced in the way of the receiver of the Inquisition of Jaen in seizing\r\ncertain confiscated property at Alcázar de Consuegra.[516] More\r\nindicative of popular repugnance is a letter of October 4, 1502, to the\r\nroyal officials of a place not specified, reciting that the people are\r\nendeavoring to have Mosen Salvador Serras, lieutenant of the vicar,\r\nremoved because he had spoken well of the Inquisition and had been\r\ncharged by the inquisitors with certain duties to perform; they are not\r\nto allow this to be done and are to see that he is not ill-treated.[517]\r\nIn 1509 Ferdinand had occasion to remonstrate with the Duke of Alva, in\r\nthe case of Alonso de Jaen, a resident of Coria, because, when he was\r\narrested, an agent of the duke had seized certain cows and sold them\r\nand, when he was condemned and his property confiscated, Alva had\r\nforbidden any one to purchase anything without his permission.\r\nFerdinand charges him to allow the sale to proceed freely and to account\r\nfor the cows, pointing out that he had granted to him a third of the net\r\nproceeds of all confiscations in his estates.[518] This grant of a third\r\nof the confiscations was made to other great nobles and doubtless tended\r\nto reconcile them to the operations of the Inquisition. In this general\r\nacquiescence it is somewhat remarkable that, as late as 1520, when\r\nCharles V ordered Merida to prepare accommodations for a tribunal, the\r\ncity remonstrated; everything there was quiet and peaceable, it said,\r\nand it feared a tumult if the Holy Office was established there, while\r\nif merely a visit was made for an inquest it would lend willing aid.\r\nCardinal Adrian hearkened to the warning in Charles's absence and in a\r\nletter of November 27, 1520, ordered his inquisitors to settle somewhere\r\nelse.[519]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FERDINAND'S BIGOTRY_]\r\n\r\nAt the same time it was inevitable that power so irresponsible would be\r\nfrequently and greatly abused, and it is interesting to observe that,\r\nwhen no resistance was made, Ferdinand was, as a general rule, prompt to\r\nintervene in favor of the oppressed. Thus January 28, 1498, he writes to\r\nthe inquisitors-general that recently some officials of the Inquisition\r\nof Valencia went to the barony of Serra to arrest some women who wore\r\nMoorish dress and, as they were not recognized, they were resisted by\r\nthe Moors, whereupon the inquisitors proceeded to seize all the Moors of\r\nSerra who chanced to come to Valencia, so that the place was becoming\r\ndepopulated. He therefore orders the inquisitors-general to intimate to\r\ntheir subordinates that they must find some other method whereby the\r\ninnocent shall not suffer for the fault of individuals and, not content\r\nwith this, he wrote directly to the Inquisitor of Valencia, instructing\r\nhim to proceed with much moderation. In another case where opposition\r\nhad been provoked he writes, January 18, 1499, \"We have your letter and\r\nare much displeased with the maltreatment which you report of the\r\ninquisitor and his officials. It will be attended to duly. But often you\r\nyourselves are the cause of it, for if each of you would attend to his\r\nduties quietly and carefully and injure no one you would be held in good\r\nesteem. Look to this in the future, for it will displease us much if you\r\ndo what you ought not, with little foundation.\" At the same time he\r\ncharges the inquisitor not to make arrests without good cause, \"for in\r\nsuch things, besides the charge on your conscience, the Holy Office is\r\nmuch defamed and its officials despised.\" So in a letter of August 15,\r\n1500, to the inquisitors of Saragossa, he tells them that he has\r\nreceived a copy of an edict which they had issued at Calatayud; it is so\r\nsharp that if it is enforced no one can be safe; they must consider such\r\nthings carefully or consult him; in the present case they will obey the\r\ninstructions sent by the inquisitors-general and must always bear in\r\nmind that the only object of the Inquisition is the salvation of souls.\r\nAgain, when the inquisitors of Barcelona imperiously placed the town of\r\nPerpiñan under interdict, in a quarrel arising out of a censal or\r\nground-rent on Carcella, Ferdinand writes to them, March 5, 1501, that\r\nthe town is poor and must be gently treated, especially as it is on the\r\nfrontier, and he sends a special envoy to arrange the matter.[520] The\r\nwearing delays, which were one of the most terrible engines of\r\noppression by the Inquisition, were especially distasteful to him.\r\nJanuary 28, 1498, he writes to an inquisitor about the case of Anton\r\nRúiz of Teruel, who had been imprisoned for five months without trial\r\nfor some remarks made by him to another person about the confiscation of\r\nthe property of Jaime de Santangel, though application had been made\r\nrepeatedly to have the case despatched. Ferdinand orders that it be\r\nconsidered at once; the prisoner is either to be discharged on bail or\r\nproper punishment is to be inflicted. So, January 16, 1501, he reminds\r\ninquisitors that he has written to them several times to conclude the\r\ncase between the heirs of Mossen Perea and the sons of Anton Rúiz and\r\ndeliver sentence; the case has been concluded for some time but the\r\nsentence is withheld; it must be rendered at once or the case must be\r\neither delegated to a competent person or be sent to the Suprema. At the\r\nsame time, whenever there was the semblance of opposition to an\r\ninjustice, on the part of the secular authorities, he was prompt to\r\nrepress it. The action of the Inquisition of Valencia, in confiscating\r\nthe property of a certain Valenzuola, excited so much feeling that the\r\ngovernor, the auditor-general, the royal council and the jurados met to\r\nprotest against it and in so doing said some things unpleasing to the\r\ninquisitors, who thereupon complained to Ferdinand. He wrote to the\r\noffenders, March 21, 1499, rebuking them severely; it was none of their\r\nbusiness; if the inquisitors committed an injustice the appeal lay to\r\nthe inquisitor-general, who would rectify it; their duty was to aid the\r\nInquisition and he ordered them to do so in future and not to create\r\nscandal.[521] He was more considerate when the frontier town of Perpiñan\r\nwas concerned, for in 1513, when the deputy receiver of confiscations\r\nprovoked antagonism by the vigor of his proceedings and the consuls\r\ncomplained that he had publicly insulted Franco Maler, one of their\r\nnumber, Ferdinand ordered the inquisitor of Barcelona to investigate the\r\nmatter at once and to inflict due punishment.[522]\r\n\r\nHis whole correspondence shows the untiring interest which he felt in\r\nthe institution, not merely as a financial or political instrument, but\r\nas a means of defending and advancing the faith. He was sincerely\r\nbigoted and, when he had witnessed an auto de fe in Valladolid, he\r\nwrote, September 30, 1509, to the inquisitor Juan Alonso de Navia to\r\nexpress the great pleasure which it had given him as a means of\r\nadvancing the honor and glory of God and the exaltation of the Holy\r\nCatholic faith.[523] Inquisitors were in the habit of sending him\r\nreports of the autos celebrated by them, to which he would reply in\r\nterms of high satisfaction, urging them to increased zeal. On one\r\noccasion, in 1512, and on another in 1513, he was so much pleased that\r\nhe made a present to the inquisitor of two hundred ducats and ordered\r\nfifteen ducats to be given to the messenger.[524]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century elapsed before there was, in the Castilian\r\nkingdoms, any serious resistance to the Inquisition. The trouble which\r\nthen occurred was provoked by the excesses of an inquisitor named Lucero\r\nat Córdova, which were brought to light only by the relaxation of\r\nFerdinand's stern rule during the brief reign of Philip of Austria and\r\nthe subsequent interregnum. As this affords us the only opportunity of\r\nobtaining an inside view of what was possible, under the usually\r\nimpenetrable mantle of secrecy characteristic of inquisitorial\r\nprocedure, it is worthy of investigation in some detail.\r\n\r\nCórdova was somewhat unfortunate in its inquisitors; whether more or\r\nless so than other communities it would now be impossible to say.\r\nLucero's predecessor was Doctor Guiral, Dean of Guadix, who was\r\ntransferred from there to Avila, in 1499. Falling under suspicion for\r\nirregularities, a papal brief was procured commissioning the Archbishop\r\nof Toledo to investigate him--and it is noteworthy that, although the\r\ninquisitor-general had full power of appointment, punishment and\r\ndismissal, papal intervention was deemed necessary in this case. The\r\nresult showed the ample opportunities offered by the position for\r\nirregular gains and for oppression and injustice. He had received\r\n150,000 maravedís by selling to penitents exemptions from wearing the\r\nsanbenito, or penitential garment. A large amount was secured in various\r\nways from the receiver of confiscations, who was evidently an accomplice\r\nand who, of course, received his share of the spoils. Pilfering from\r\nsequestrated property yielded something, including ninety-three pearls\r\nof great value. Through his servants he gathered rewards or percentages\r\noffered, as we shall see, for discovering concealed confiscated\r\nproperty. He pocketed the fines which he imposed on reconciled penitents\r\nand was therefore interested in aggravating them. He negotiated for the\r\nConversos of Córdova an agreement under which they compounded with\r\n2,200,000 maravedís for confiscations to which they might become liable,\r\nand for this he received from them nearly 100,000, to which he added\r\n50,000 by enabling two of the contributors to cheat their fellows by\r\nescaping payment of their assessments to the common fund. When\r\ntransferred to Avila his field of operations was less productive, but he\r\nmade what he could by extorting money from the kindred of his prisoners,\r\nand he did not disdain to take ten ducats and an ass from an official of\r\nthe prison for some offence committed. As the royal fisc suffered from\r\nhis practices he was arrested and tried, but, unfortunately, the\r\ndocuments at hand do not inform us as to the result.[525]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EXCESSES OF LUCERO_]\r\n\r\nHis successor at Córdova, Diego Rodríguez Lucero, was a criminal of\r\nlarger views and bolder type, who presents himself to us as the\r\nincarnation of the evils resultant from the virtually irresponsible\r\npowers lodged in the tribunals. Our first glimpse of him is in 1495,\r\nwhen he figures as inquisitor of Xeres and the recipient from Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella of a canonry in Cadiz.[526] This shows that he had already\r\ngained the favor of the sovereigns, which increased after his promotion\r\nto Córdova, September 7, 1499, where, by the methods which we shall\r\npresently see, his discoveries of apostate Judaizers were very\r\nimpressive. A royal letter of December 11, 1500, cordially thanked him\r\nfor the ample details of a recent despatch relating how he was every day\r\nunearthing new heretics; he was urged to spare no effort for their\r\npunishment, especially of those who had relapsed, and to report at once\r\neverything that he did. His zeal scarce required this stimulation and\r\nhis lawless methods are indicated by a letter of February 12, 1501, of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella to their son-in-law Manoel of Portugal,\r\nexpatiating on the numerous heretics recently discovered in Córdova, of\r\nwhom two heresiarchs, Alfonso Fernández Herrero and Fernando de Córdova\r\nhad escaped to Portugal, whither Lucero had despatched his alguazil to\r\nbring them back without waiting to obtain royal letters. This was an\r\nunwarrantable act and, when the alguazil seized the fugitives, Manoel\r\nrefused license to extradite them until he should have an opportunity of\r\nseeing the evidence against them. Ferdinand and Isabella declare that\r\nthis would be a grievous impediment to the Holy Office and disservice to\r\nGod and they affectionately entreat Manoel to surrender the accused for\r\nthe honor of God and also to protect from maltreatment the officials who\r\nhad aided in their capture.[527]\r\n\r\nWe may not uncharitably assume that a portion, at least, of the favor\r\nshown to Lucero may have been due to the pecuniary results of his\r\nactivity. By this time the confiscations, which at first had contributed\r\nlargely to the royal treasury, were considerably diminished and at some\r\nplaces were scarce defraying the expenses of the tribunals. To this\r\nCórdova was now an exception; that its productiveness was rapidly\r\ngrowing is manifest from a letter of Ferdinand, March 12, 1501, to the\r\nreceiver, Andrés de Medina, stating that he learns that there is much to\r\nbe done and authorizing the appointment of two assistants at salaries of\r\n10,000 maravedís and, on January 12 and 13, 1503, orders were drawn on\r\nCórdova for 500,000 maravedís to defray inquisitorial salaries\r\nelsewhere. On the same date we have another illustration of Lucero's\r\nactivity in the sudden arrest of four of the official public scriveners.\r\nAs they were the depositaries of the papers of their clients, the\r\nsequestration of all their effects produced enormous complications, to\r\nrelieve which Ferdinand ordered all private documents to be sorted out\r\nand put in the hands of another scrivener, Luis de Mesa. This shows how\r\nthe operations of the Inquisition might at any moment affect the\r\ninterests of any man and it illustrates another of the profits of\r\npersecution for, when these delinquents should be burnt or disabled from\r\nholding public office, there would be four vacancies to be eagerly\r\ncontended for by those who had money or favor for their\r\nacquisition.[528]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SECRETARY CALCENA_]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1501 there is evidence of hostility between Lucero and the\r\nCórdovan authorities. When the receiver of confiscations, accompanied by\r\nDiego de Barrionuevo, scrivener of sequestrations, was holding a public\r\nauction of confiscated property, the alguazil mayor of the city, Gonzalo\r\nde Mayorga, ordered the town-crier, Juan Sánchez, who was crying the\r\nauction, to come with him in order to make certain proclamations. The\r\nscrivener interposed and refused to let Sánchez go; hot words passed in\r\nwhich Mayorga insulted the Inquisition and finally struck the scrivener\r\nwith his wand of office, after which the alcalde mayor of the city,\r\nDiego Rúiz de Zarate, carried him off to prison. The inviolability of\r\nthe officials of the Inquisition was vindicated by a royal sentence of\r\nSeptember 6th, in which Mayorga, in addition to the arbitrary penance\r\nto be imposed on him by Lucero, was deprived of his office for life, was\r\ndisabled from filling any public position whatever, and was banished\r\nperpetually from Córdova and its district, which he was to leave within\r\neight days after notification. Zarate was more mercifully treated and\r\nescaped with six months' suspension from office.[529] This severity to\r\ncivic officials of high position was a warning to all men that Lucero\r\nwas not to be trifled with.\r\n\r\nThe unwavering support that he received from Ferdinand is largely\r\nexplicable by the complicity of Juan Róiz de Calcena, a corrupt and\r\nmercenary official whom we shall frequently meet hereafter. He was\r\nFerdinand's secretary in inquisitorial affairs, conducting all his\r\ncorrespondence in such matters, and was also secretary to the Suprema,\r\nand thus was able in great degree to control his master's action,\r\nrendering his participation in the villainies on foot essential to their\r\nsuccess. How these were worked is displayed in a single case which\r\nhappens to be described in a memorial from the city of Córdova to Queen\r\nJuana. The Archdeacon of Castro, Juan Muñoz, was a youth of seventeen,\r\nthe son of an Old Christian mother and a Converso hidalgo. His benefice\r\nwas worth 300,000 maravedís a year and he was a fair subject of\r\nspoliation, for which a plot was organized in 1505. His parents were\r\ninvolved in his ruin, all three were arrested and convicted and he was\r\npenanced so as to disable him from holding preferment. The spoils were\r\ndivided between Cardinal Bernardino Carvajal, for whom bulls had been\r\nprocured in advance, Morales the royal treasurer, Lucero and Calcena.\r\nThe governor and chapter of Córdova gave the archdeaconry to Diego\r\nVello, chaplain of the bishop, but the Holy See conveniently refused\r\nconfirmation and bestowed it on Morales; Lucero obtained a canonry in\r\nSeville and some benefices in Cuenca, while Calcena received property\r\nestimated at 4,000,000 maravedís--doubtless an exaggerated figure\r\nrepresenting the aggregate of his gains from complicity throughout\r\nLucero's career.[530]\r\n\r\nIt was probably in 1501 that the combination was formed which emboldened\r\nLucero to extend his operations, arresting and condemning nobles and\r\ngentlemen and church dignitaries, many of them Old Christians of\r\nunblemished reputation and _limpios de sangre_. It was easy, by abuse\r\nand threats, or by torture if necessary, to procure from the accused\r\nwhatever evidence was necessary to convict, not only themselves but\r\nwhomsoever it was desired to ruin. A great fear fell upon the whole\r\npopulation, for no one could tell where the next blow might fall, as the\r\ncircle of denunciation spread through all ranks. Apologists from that\r\ntime to this have endeavored to extenuate these proceedings by\r\nsuggesting that those compromised endeavored to secure allies by\r\ninculpating in their confessions men of rank and influence, but in view\r\nof Lucero's methods and the extent of his operations such an explanation\r\nis wholly inadequate to overthrow the damning mass of evidence against\r\nhim.[531]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LUCERO'S REIGN OF TERROR_]\r\n\r\nHis views expanded beyond the narrow bounds of Córdova, and he horrified\r\nthe land by gathering evidence of a vast conspiracy, ramifying\r\nthroughout Spain, for the purpose of subverting Christianity and\r\nreplacing it with Judaism, which required for its suppression the most\r\ncomprehensive and pitiless measures. In memorials to Queen Juana the\r\nauthorities, ecclesiastic and secular, of Córdova described how he had\r\ncertain of his prisoners assiduously instructed in Jewish prayers and\r\nrites so that they could be accurate in the testimony which, by menaces\r\nor torture, he forced them to bear against Old Christians of undoubted\r\northodoxy. In this way he proved that there were twenty-five\r\n_profetissas_ who were engaged in traversing the land to convert it to\r\nJudaism, although many of those designated had never in their lives been\r\noutside of the city gates. Accompanying them were fifty distinguished\r\npersonages, including ecclesiastics and preachers of note.[532] Of\r\ncourse, these stories lost nothing in passing from mouth to mouth, and\r\nit was popularly said that some of these prophetesses, in their unholy\r\nerrand, travelled as drunken Bacchantes and others were transported on\r\ngoats by the powers of hell.[533] A single instance, which happens to\r\nhave reached us, illustrates the savage thoroughness with which he\r\nprotected the faith from this assault. A certain Bachiller Membreque was\r\nconvicted as an apostate Judaizer who had disseminated his doctrines by\r\npreaching. Lists were gathered from witnesses of those who had attended\r\nhis sermons and these, to the number of a hundred and seven, were burnt\r\nalive in a single auto de fe.[534] The inquisitorial prisons were filled\r\nwith the unfortunates under accusation, as many as four hundred being\r\nthus incarcerated, and large numbers were carried to Toro where, at the\r\ntime, Inquisitor-general Deza resided with the Suprema.\r\n\r\nThe reign of terror thus established was by no means confined to\r\nCórdova. Its effects are energetically described by the Capitan Gonzalo\r\nde Avora, in a letter of July 16, 1507, to the royal secretary Almazan.\r\nAfter premising that he had represented to Ferdinand, with that\r\nmonarch's assent, that there were three things requisite for the good of\r\nthe kingdom--to conduct the Inquisition righteously without weakening\r\nit, to wage war with the Moors, and to relieve the burdens of the\r\npeople--he proceeds to contrast this with what had been done. \"As for\r\nthe Inquisition,\" he says, \"the method adopted was to place so much\r\nconfidence in the Archbishop of Seville (Deza) and in Lucero and Juan de\r\nla Fuente that they were able to defame the whole kingdom, to destroy,\r\nwithout God or justice, a great part of it, slaying and robbing and\r\nviolating maids and wives to the great dishonor of the Christian\r\nreligion.... As for what concerns myself I repeat what I have already\r\nwritten to you, that the damages which the wicked officials of the\r\nInquisition have wrought in my land are so many and so great that no\r\nreasonable person on hearing of them would not grieve.\"[535] When a\r\nhorde of rapacious officials, clothed in virtual inviolability, was let\r\nloose upon a defenceless population, such violence and rapine were\r\ninevitable incidents, and the motive of this was explained, by the\r\nBishop of Córdova and all the authorities of the city, in a petition to\r\nthe pope, to be the greed of the inquisitors for the confiscations which\r\nthey habitually embezzled.[536]\r\n\r\nIt was probably in 1505, after the death of Isabella, November 16, 1504,\r\nthat the people of Córdova first ventured to complain to Deza. He\r\noffered to send the Archdeacon Torquemada who, with representatives of\r\nthe chapter and the magistrates, should make an impartial investigation,\r\nbut when the city accepted the proposition he withdrew it. A deputation\r\nconsisting of three church dignitaries was then sent to him asking for\r\nthe arrest and prosecution of Lucero. He replied that if they would draw\r\nup accusations in legal form he would act as would best tend to God's\r\nservice, and, if necessary, would appoint judges to whom they could not\r\nobject.[537] This was a manifest evasion, for the evidence was under the\r\nseal of the Inquisition and Deza alone could order an investigation.\r\nApparently realizing that it was useless to appeal to Ferdinand, whose\r\nears were closed by Calcena, their next recourse was to Isabella's\r\ndaughter and successor, Queen Juana, then in Flanders with her husband\r\nPhilip of Austria. Philip was eager to exercise an act of sovereignty in\r\nthe kingdom, which Ferdinand was governing in the name of his daughter\r\nand, on September 30, 1505, a cédula bearing the signatures of Philip\r\nand Juana was addressed to Deza, alleging their desire to be present and\r\nparticipate in the action of the Inquisition and meanwhile suspending it\r\nuntil their approaching arrival in Castile, under penalty of banishment\r\nand seizure of temporalities for disobedience, at the same time\r\nprotesting that their desire was to favor and not to injure the Holy\r\nOffice. Although a circular letter to all the grandees announced this\r\nresolution and commanded them to enforce it, no attention was paid to\r\nit. Don Diego de Guevara, Philip's envoy, in fact wrote to him the\r\nfollowing June that his action had produced a bad impression, for the\r\npeople were hostile to the Conversos and there was talk of massacres\r\nlike that of Lisbon.[538]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARCHBISHOP TALAVERA]\r\n\r\nThe next step of the opponents of Lucero was to recuse Deza as judge and\r\nto interject an appeal to the Holy See, leading to an active contest in\r\nRome between Ferdinand and his son-in-law. A letter of the former, April\r\n22, 1506, to Juan de Loaysa, agent of the Inquisition in Rome, described\r\nthe attempt as an audacious and indecent effort to destroy the\r\nInquisition which was more necessary than ever. Loaysa was told that he\r\ncould render no greater service to God and to the king than by defeating\r\nit; minute instructions were given as to the influences that he must\r\nbring to bear, and he was reminded that Holy Writ permits the use of\r\ncraft and cunning to perform the work of God. The extreme anxiety\r\nbetrayed in the letter indicates that there was much more involved than\r\nthe mere defence of Lucero and Deza; it was with Philip and Juana that\r\nhe was wrestling and the stake was the crown of Castile. On the other\r\nhand, Philip, doubtless won by the gold of the Conversos, had fairly\r\nespoused their cause and was laboring to obtain for them a favorable\r\ndecision from the pope. His ambassador, Philibert of Utrecht, under date\r\nof June 28th, reported that he had urged Julius II not to reject the\r\nappeal of the Marranos but the politic pontiff replied that he must\r\nreserve his decision until Ferdinand and Philip had met.[539]\r\n\r\nUndeterred by the mutterings of the rising storm, Lucero about this time\r\nsaw in Isabella's death a chance to strike at a higher quarry than he\r\nhad hitherto ventured to aim at. The Geronimite Hernando de Talavera had\r\nwon her affectionate veneration as her confessor and, on the conquest of\r\nGranada, in 1492, she had made him archbishop of the province founded\r\nthere. He had a Jewish strain in his blood, as was the case in so many\r\nSpanish families; he was in his eightieth year, he was reverenced as the\r\npattern and exemplar of all Christian virtues and he devoted himself\r\nunsparingly to the welfare of his flock, spending his revenues in\r\ncharity and seeking by persuasion and example to win over to the faith\r\nhis Moorish subjects. Yet he was not without enemies, for he had been\r\nthe active agent in the reclamation by Ferdinand and Isabella, in 1480,\r\nof royal revenues to the amount of thirty millions of maravedís,\r\nalienated by Henry IV to purchase the submission of rebellious nobles\r\nand, although a quarter of a century had passed, it is said that the\r\nvengeful spirit thus aroused was still eager to encompass his ruin.[540]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been Lucero's motive, inquisitorial methods afforded\r\nabundant facilities for its accomplishment. He selected a woman whom he\r\nhad tortured on the charge of being a Jewish prophetess and maintaining\r\na synagogue in her house. He threatened her with further torture unless\r\nshe should testify to what she had seen in a room in Talavera's palace\r\nand on her replying that she did not know, he instructed her that an\r\nassembly was held, divided into three classes; in the first was the\r\narchbishop, with the bishops of Almería, Jaen and others; in the second,\r\nthe dean and the provisor of Granada, the treasurer, the alcaide and\r\nother officials; in the third the prophetesses, the sister and nieces of\r\nTalavera, Doña María de Peñalosa and others. They agreed to traverse the\r\nkingdom, preaching and prophesying the advent of Elias and the Messiah,\r\nin concert with the prophets who were in the house of Fernan Alvárez of\r\nToledo, where they were crowned with golden crowns.[541] All this was\r\nduly sworn to by the witness, as dictated to her by the fiscal, and\r\nformed a basis for the prosecution of Talavera and his family, doubtless\r\nsupported by ample corroborative evidence, readily obtainable in the\r\nsame manner. The occurrence of the name of the Bishop of Jaen suggests a\r\nfurther political intrigue; he was Alfonso Suárez de Fuentelsaz, the\r\nformer colleague of Deza as inquisitor-general and was no doubt known as\r\ninclining to the Flemish party, as he subsequently accepted from Philip\r\nthe presidency of the Royal Council.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PHILIP AND JUANA_]\r\n\r\nImpenetrable secrecy was one of the most cherished principles of\r\ninquisitorial procedure, but Lucero probably desired to prepare the\r\npublic for the impending blow and whispers concerning it began to\r\ncirculate. Peter Martyr of Anghiera, who was attached to the royal\r\ncourt, wrote on January 3, 1506, to the Count of Tendilla, Governor of\r\nGranada, that Lucero, by means of witnesses under torture, had succeeded\r\nin imputing Judaism to the archbishop and his whole family and\r\nhousehold; as there was no one more holy than Talavera, he found it\r\ndifficult to believe that any one could be found to fabricate such a\r\ncharge.[542] The attack commenced by arresting, in the most public and\r\noffensive manner, Talavera's nephew, the dean and the officials of his\r\nchurch, during divine service and in his presence, evidently with the\r\npurpose of discrediting him. The arrest followed of his sister, his\r\nnieces and his servants, and we can readily conceive the means by which\r\neven his kindred were compelled to give evidence incriminating him, as\r\nwe gather from a letter of Ferdinand, June 9, 1506, to his ambassador at\r\nRome, Francisco de Rojas, in which he says that the testimony against\r\nTalavera is that of his sisters and kindred and servants.[543] Before he\r\ncould be arrested and prosecuted, however, special authorization from\r\nthe Holy See was requisite, for, by a decree of Boniface VIII,\r\ninquisitors had no direct jurisdiction over bishops. For this,\r\nFerdinand's intervention was necessary and, after some hesitation, he\r\nconsented to make the application. The inculpatory evidence given by\r\nTalavera's family was sent to Rome; Francisco de Rojas procured the\r\npapal commission for his trial and forwarded it, June 3, 1506.[544]\r\n\r\nBefore it was despatched, however, Ferdinand's position had changed with\r\nthe arrival in Spain of his daughter Juana, now Queen of Castile, and\r\nher husband Philip of Austria. Eager to throw off Ferdinand's iron rule\r\nand to win the favor of the new sovereigns, most of the nobles had\r\nflocked to them and with them the Conversos, who hoped to secure a\r\nmodification in the rigor of the Inquisition. They had been aroused by\r\nthe sufferings of their brethren in Córdova, whose cause was their own,\r\nand they were becoming an element not to be disregarded in the political\r\nsituation; they had already secured a hearing in the Roman curia, always\r\nready, as we shall see hereafter, to welcome appellants with money and\r\nto sacrifice them after payment received; they had obtained from Julius\r\nII commissions transferring from the Inquisition cognizance of certain\r\ncases--commissions which Ferdinand repeatedly asked the pope to withdraw\r\nand doubtless with success, as they do not appear in the course of\r\nevents; they had even approached Ferdinand himself, while in Valladolid,\r\nwith an offer of a hundred thousand ducats if he would suspend the\r\nInquisition until the arrival of Juana and Philip. This offer, he says\r\nin a letter of June 9, 1506, to Rojas, he spurned, but we may perhaps\r\ndoubt his disinterestedness when he adds that, as Philip has disembarked\r\nand is unfamiliar with Spanish affairs, he had secretly ordered Deza to\r\nsuspend the operations of all the tribunals--the motive of which\r\nevidently was to create the belief that Philip was responsible for it.\r\nAs for Talavera, he adds, as it would greatly scandalize the new\r\nconverts of Granada, if they thought there were errors of faith in him\r\nwhom they regarded as so good a Christian, he had concluded to let the\r\nmatter rest for the present and would subsequently send\r\ninstructions.[545] He evidently had no belief in Lucero's fabricated\r\nevidence, a fact to be borne in mind when we consider his attitude in\r\nthe ultimate developments of the affair. This despatch, of course,\r\nreached Rojas too late to prevent the issuing of the commission to try\r\nTalavera, but it explains why that document was suppressed when it\r\narrived. Deza denied receiving it; it disappeared and Talavera, in his\r\nletter of January 23, 1507, to Ferdinand, manifests much anxiety to know\r\nwhat had become of it, evidently dreading that it would be opportunely\r\nfound when wanted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITION SUCCUMBS_]\r\n\r\nBy the agreement of Villafáfila, June 27, 1506, Ferdinand bound himself\r\nto abandon Castile to Philip and Juana; he departed for Aragon and\r\nbusied himself with preparations for a voyage to Naples, whither he set\r\nsail September 4th. Philip assumed the government and disembarrassed\r\nhimself of his wife by shutting her up as unfit to share in the cares of\r\nroyalty. He was amenable to the golden arguments of the Conversos and\r\ndoubtless had not forgotten the contempt with which had been treated his\r\norder of the previous year to suspend the Inquisition. He therefore\r\nnaturally was in no haste to revive its functions. Ferdinand's secretary\r\nAlmazan writes to Rojas, July 1st, that the king and the grandees have\r\nimprisoned Juana and no one is allowed to see her; he has in vain sought\r\nto get some prelates to carry letters from her to her father, but no one\r\nventures to do so; the grandees have done this to partition among\r\nthemselves the royal power, the Conversos to free themselves from the\r\nInquisition, which is now extinct.[546]\r\n\r\nThe people of Córdova made haste to take advantage of the situation.\r\nThey sent a powerful appeal to Philip and Juana, stating that their\r\nprevious complaints had been intercepted through Deza's influence and\r\naccusing Lucero of the most arbitrary iniquities.[547] They asked that\r\nall the inquisitorial officials at Córdova and Toro should be removed\r\nand the whole affair be committed to the Bishop of Leon. Philip referred\r\nthe matter to the Comendador mayor, Garcilasso de la Vega and to Andrea\r\ndi Borgo, ambassador of Maximilian I, two laymen, to the great scandal,\r\nwe are told, of all ecclesiastics.[548] The Conversos were triumphant\r\nand the Inquisition succumbed completely. The Suprema, including Deza\r\nhimself, hastened to disclaim all responsibility for Lucero's misdeeds\r\nin a letter addressed to the chapter of Córdova, in which it said that\r\nthe accusations brought against him seemed incredible, for even\r\nhighwaymen, when robbing their victims, spare their lives, while here\r\nnot only the property but the lives of the victims were taken and the\r\nhonor of their descendants to the tenth generation. But, after hearing\r\nthe narrative of the Master of Toro there could no longer be doubt and\r\nto tolerate it would be to approve it. Therefore, the chapter was\r\ninstructed to continue to prevent these iniquities, and their majesties\r\nwould be asked to apply a remedy and to punish their authors.[549] The\r\nremedy applied was to compel Deza to subdelegate irrevocably to Diego\r\nRamírez de Guzman, Bishop of Catania and member of the Council of State,\r\npower to supersede Lucero and revise his acts, which was confirmed by a\r\npapal brief placing in Guzman's hands all the papers and prisoners in\r\nCórdova, Toro and Valladolid.[550] Lucero endeavored to anticipate this\r\nby burning all his prisoners so as to get them out of the way, but after\r\nthe auto de fe was announced there came orders from the sovereigns which\r\nfortunately prevented the holocaust.[551]\r\n\r\nThe relief of the sufferers seemed assured, but the situation was\r\nradically changed by the sudden death of Philip, September 25, 1506, for\r\nalthough Juana was treated nominally as queen, she exercised no\r\nauthority. Deza promptly revoked Guzman's commission, of which the papal\r\nconfirmation seems not to have been received; he took possession of the\r\nprisoners at Toro and sent the Archdeacon of Torquemada to Córdova to do\r\nthe same, but Francisco Osorio, the representative of Guzman, refused to\r\nobey. The people of Córdova were in despair. It was in vain that they\r\nsent delegations to Deza and petitioned the queen to save them. Deza was\r\nimmovable and the queen refused to act in this as in everything else.\r\nThe chapter, every member of which was an Old Christian, proud of his\r\n_limpieza_, assembled on October 16th to consider the situation. Some of\r\nthe most prominent dignitaries of the Church had already been arrested\r\nby Lucero and had been treated by him as Jewish dogs; he had asserted\r\nthat all the rest, and most of the nobles and gentlemen of the city and\r\nof other places, were apostates who had converted their houses into\r\nsynagogues; in view of the impending peril, it was unanimously resolved\r\nto defend themselves, while the citizens at large declared that they\r\nwould sacrifice life and property rather than to submit longer to such\r\ninsupportable tyranny.[552]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PERSECUTION RENEWED_]\r\n\r\nIf the eclipse of the royal authority had enabled Deza to restore Lucero\r\nto power it also afforded opportunity for forcible resistance. The\r\ngrandees of Castile were striving to recover the independence enjoyed\r\nunder Henry IV, and a condition of anarchy was approaching rapidly. The\r\ntwo great nobles of Córdova, the Count of Cabra, Lord of Baena and the\r\nMarquis of Priego, Lord of Aguilar and nephew of the Great Captain, were\r\nnothing loath to listen to the entreaties of the citizens, especially as\r\nthe marquis had been summoned by Lucero to appear for trial. Meetings\r\nwere held in which formal accusations of Lucero and his promotor fiscal,\r\nJuan de Arriola, were laid before Padre Fray Francisco de Cuesta,\r\ncomendador of the convent of la Merced, who seems to have assumed the\r\nleadership of the movement. He pronounced judgement, ordering Lucero and\r\nthe fiscal to be arrested and their property to be confiscated. Under\r\nthe lead of Cabra and Priego the citizens arose to execute the\r\njudgement. On November 9th they broke into the alcázar, where the\r\nInquisition held its seat, they seized the fiscal and some of the\r\nsubordinates and liberated the prisoners, whose recital of their wrongs\r\nexcited still more the popular indignation, but no blood was shed and\r\nLucero saved himself by flight.[553] The whole proceeding appears to\r\nhave been orderly: a commission of ecclesiastics and laymen was\r\nappointed, to which the kinsmen and friends of the prisoners gave\r\nsecurity that they should be forthcoming for trial as soon as there\r\nshould be a king in the land to administer justice. This engagement was\r\nduly kept and their temporary liberation under bail was justified on the\r\nground that many of them had been incarcerated for six or seven years\r\nand that all were in danger of perishing by starvation, for they were\r\npenniless, their property having been confiscated and Deza having\r\nordered the receiver of confiscations not to provide for them.[554]\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this uprising reached Deza he promptly, November 18th,\r\ncommissioned his nephew, Pedro Juárez de Deza, Archbishop-elect of the\r\nIndies, to prosecute and punish all concerned, while by his orders the\r\ntribunal of Toledo intercepted and threw into prison Doctor Alonso de\r\nToro, sent by the city to present its case to the queen. Other envoys,\r\nhowever, bore instructions to ask for the removal of Deza and the\r\nprosecution of Lucero and his officials, coupled with the intimation\r\nthat steps had been taken to convoke all the cities of Andalusia and\r\nCastile to devise measures of protection against the intolerable tyranny\r\nof the Inquisition.[555] This plan seems to have been abandoned but,\r\nearly in January, 1507, the Bishop of Córdova, Juan de Daza, in\r\nconjunction with the clerical and secular authorities, sent a solemn\r\nappeal to the pope, asking him to appoint Archbishop Ximenes and the\r\nBishop of Catania or of Málaga, with full power to investigate and to\r\nact, and this they accompanied, January 10th, with a petition to\r\nFerdinand, who was still in Naples, to support their request to the\r\npope.[556] Deza, however, continued to command Ferdinand's unwavering\r\nsupport and the result was seen in the prompt and uncompromising action\r\nof Julius II. He wrote to Deza that the Jews, pretending to be\r\nChristians, who had dared to rise against the Inquisition, must be\r\nexterminated root and branch; no labor was to be spared to suppress this\r\npestilence before it should spread, to hunt up all who had participated\r\nin it and to exercise the utmost severity in punishing them, without\r\nappeal, for their crimes.[557]\r\n\r\nThus stimulated and encouraged, Lucero resumed his activity and the\r\nliberated prisoners were surrendered to him. Peter Martyr writes from\r\nthe court, March 7, 1507, to Archbishop Talavera, that his sister and\r\nhis nephew the Dean of Granada, Francisco Herrera--who had doubtless\r\nbeen released in the rising of November 9th--had been thrown in prison\r\nin Córdova. Talavera himself, moreover, was put on trial before the\r\npapal nuncio, Giovanni Ruffo, and assessors duly commissioned by the\r\npope, showing that Ferdinand's scruples as to scandalizing the people of\r\nGranada had vanished in the fierce resolve to vindicate Lucero and that\r\nthe missing papal brief had been duly found. Peter Martyr describes his\r\nearnest efforts to convince the judges of Talavera's holy life and\r\nspotless character, to which they replied that all this might be true\r\nbut their business was to ascertain the secrets of his heart.[558] By\r\nthe time the evidence was sent to Rome, however, his conviction was no\r\nlonger desired; the testimony was pronounced to be worthless and Pascual\r\nde la Fuente, Bishop of Burgos, who was in attendance on the curia, was\r\nan earnest witness in his favor.[559] The papal sentence was acquittal\r\nand this apparently carried with it the exoneration of his kindred--but\r\nit came too late. On May 21st Peter Martyr exultingly writes to him that\r\nthe dean and his sister with their mother and the rest of his innocent\r\nhousehold had been set free, but already he had gone to a higher\r\ntribunal. On Ascension-day (May 13th) he had walked, bareheaded and\r\nbarefooted, in the procession through the streets of Granada, when a\r\nviolent fever set in and carried him off the next day. He had\r\naccumulated no treasure, having spent all his revenues on the poor; he\r\nleft no provision for his family and the Bishop of Málaga charitably\r\ngave to his sister a house in Granada to shelter her old age. His\r\nreputation for sanctity is seen in the accounts which at once were\r\ncirculated, with universal credence of the miracles wrought by him in\r\ncuring the sick.[560]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _POLITICAL INTRIGUES_]\r\n\r\nThe reaction in favor of the Inquisition, led by Ferdinand and Julius\r\nII, had evidently been short-lived, for the political situation\r\ndominated everything and king and pope found it advisable to yield.\r\nJuana was keeping herself secluded with the corpse of her husband and\r\nwas refusing to govern. The rival factions of the two grandfathers of\r\nCharles V, Maximilian I and Ferdinand, each striving for the regency\r\nduring his minority, were both desirous of the support of the Conversos\r\nand thus the question of the Córdovan prisoners attained national\r\nimportance as one on which all parties took sides. Ximenes, the Duke of\r\nAlva and the Constable of Castile, the heads of Ferdinand's party, held\r\na conference at Cavia and listened to the complaints against Deza, for\r\nwhich they promised to find a remedy. The friends of the prisoners,\r\nhowever, seemed more inclined towards the faction of Maximilian; they\r\noffered money to defray the expenses of troops to be sent to Spain to\r\nresist Ferdinand's return and it was currently rumored that four\r\nthousand men were gathered in a Flemish port ready to embark. It is not\r\neasy to penetrate the secret intrigues culminating in the settlement\r\nwhich gave the regency to Ferdinand, but Ximenes, who represented him,\r\ntook advantage of the situation, with his usual skill, to further his\r\nown ambition, which was to gain the cardinal's hat and Deza's position\r\nas inquisitor-general.[561] For the former of these Ferdinand had made\r\napplication as early as November 8, 1505, and had repeated the request\r\nOctober 30, 1506; it was granted in secret consistory, January 4, 1507,\r\nand was published May 17th.[562] For the latter, the complaints of the\r\nConversos afforded substantial reasons; we have seen that Córdova had\r\npetitioned the pope to commission Ximenes as its judge and his\r\nappointment would help to pacify the troubles. Ferdinand at length\r\nrecognized that Deza's sacrifice was inevitable, and the way was made\r\neasy for him, as he was allowed to resign. On May 18th Ferdinand writes\r\nto Ximenes from Naples that he had received Deza's resignation and had\r\ntaken the necessary steps to secure for him the succession; he has two\r\nrequests to make--that he shall foster piety and religion by appointing\r\nonly the best men and that he shall exercise the utmost care that\r\nnothing shall be allowed to impair Deza's dignity.[563] The commission\r\nas inquisitor-general was duly issued on June 5, 1507.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LUCERO'S VICTIMS RELEASED_]\r\n\r\nThe hatred excited by Lucero had been too wide-spread and the friends of\r\nthe prisoners were too powerful to be satisfied with the mere\r\nsubstitution of Ximenes for Deza, and there was evidently an\r\nunderstanding that the matter was not to be dropped. As early as May\r\n1st, Peter Martyr writes that it is reported that the imprisoned\r\nwitnesses, corrupted by Lucero, are to be released and that he will\r\nexpiate with due punishment his unprecedented crimes.[564] Some such\r\npromise was probably necessary for the pacification of the land, but the\r\ndelay in its performance is significant of protection at the\r\nfountain-head of justice. It assumed at first the shape of an action\r\nbrought by the chapter and city of Córdova before the pope, charging\r\nLucero with the evil wrought by his suborning some witnesses and\r\ncompelling others by punishment to testify that the plaintiffs were\r\nheretics. Julius II commissioned Fray Francisco de Mayorga as apostolic\r\njudge to try the case, and, on October 17, 1507, he decreed that Lucero\r\nbe imprisoned and held to answer at law. Nothing further was done,\r\nhowever, and the impatient citizens addressed a memorial to Queen Juana,\r\nasking her to send some one to inform himself about it and report to\r\nher.[565] The action of the apostolic judge seems to have been regarded\r\nas a mere formality; the months passed away and it was not until May 18,\r\n1508, that the Suprema took independent cognizance of the matter, when\r\nXimenes and his colleagues, except Aguirre, all voted that Lucero should\r\nbe arrested.[566] Peter Martyr intimates more than once that numbers of\r\nthe Suprema were suspected of complicity with Lucero and assures us that\r\nthe Council did not act without thorough investigation of numerous\r\nwitnesses and interminable masses of documents, revealing an incredible\r\naccumulation of impossible and fantastic accusations contrived to bring\r\ninfamy on all Spain.[567]\r\n\r\nIt was apparently the first time that an inquisitor had been thus\r\npublicly put on trial for official malfeasance and the opportunity was\r\nimproved to render the spectacle a solemn one, fitted not only to\r\nsatisfy the national interest felt in the case but to magnify the office\r\nof the accused by the scale of the machinery employed to deal with him.\r\nLucero was carried in chains to Burgos, where the court was in\r\nresidence, and was confined in the castle under strict guard. Ximenes\r\nassembled a _Congregacion Católica_, composed of twenty-one members\r\nbesides himself, including a large portion of the Royal Council, the\r\nInquisitor-general of Aragon and other inquisitors, several bishops and\r\nvarious other dignitaries--in short, an imposing representation of the\r\npiety and learning of the land.[568] After numerous sessions, presided\r\nover by Ximenes, sentence was rendered July 9, 1508, and was published\r\nAugust 1st, at Valladolid, whither the court had removed, in presence of\r\nFerdinand and his magnates and a great concourse assembled to lend\r\nsolemnity to this restoration of the honor of Castile and Andalusia,\r\nwhich had been so deeply compromised by the pretended revelations\r\nextorted by Lucero. This weighty verdict declared that there were no\r\ngrounds for the asserted existence of synagogues, the preaching of\r\nsermons and the assemblies of missionaries of Judaism or for the\r\nprosecution of those accused. The witnesses--or rather prisoners--were\r\ndischarged and everything relating to these fictitious crimes was\r\nordered to be expunged from the records. To complete the vindication of\r\nthe memory of the victims, Ferdinand ordered the rebuilding of the\r\nhouses which had been torn down under the provisions of the canon law\r\nrequiring the destruction of the conventicles of heresy.[569] By\r\nimplication, the acquittal of the prisoners convicted Lucero, but all\r\nthis was merely preliminary to his trial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REACTION--ESCAPE OF LUCERO_]\r\n\r\nFerdinand's hand had been forced; he had been obliged to yield to public\r\nopinion, but his resolve was inflexible to undo as far as he could the\r\nresults reached by Ximenes. In October he visited Córdova, where he\r\nrewarded some officials of the tribunal by grants out of the confiscated\r\nestates, which should have been restored when the proceedings were\r\nannulled. It is true that the judge of confiscations, Licenciado\r\nSimancas, was suspended, but in November, 1509, he was ordered to resume\r\nhis functions and to act as he had formerly done. We happen to know\r\nthat, in 1513, the house of the unfortunate Bachiller Membreque was\r\nstill in possession of the Inquisition. There was no relief for those\r\nwho had suffered. When the new inquisitor, Diego López de Cortegano,\r\nArchdeacon of Seville, revoked Lucero's sentence on the Licenciado Daza,\r\nwho had been penanced and his property confiscated, the purchasers who\r\nhad bought it complained to Ferdinand and he expressed his wrath by\r\npromptly dismissing the inquisitor and ordering all the papers in the\r\ncase to be sent to the Suprema for review and action. The vacancy thus\r\ncreated was not easy to fill, for when, in September, 1509, Ferdinand\r\noffered the place to Alonso de Mariana he declined, saying that it would\r\nkill him, but he agreed to take the tribunal of Toledo, and it was not\r\nuntil February, 1510, that the Licenciado Mondragon was transferred from\r\nValladolid to take Cortegano's place. In fact, the interests involved in\r\nthe confiscations were too many and too powerful for the victims to\r\nobtain justice. Martin Alonso Conchina had been condemned by Lucero to\r\nreconciliation and confiscation; when the pressure was removed he\r\nrevoked his confession as having been extorted by threats and fear,\r\nwhereupon the confiscated property was placed in sequestration awaiting\r\nthe result. Unluckily for him one of the items, a ground-rent of 9000\r\nmrs. a year had been given, in April, 1506, to the unprincipled\r\nsecretary Calcena, with the result that one of the new inquisitors,\r\nAndrés Sánchez de Torquemada, promptly arrested Conchina, tried him\r\nagain, convicted him and sentenced him to perpetual imprisonment, so\r\nthat the confiscation held good and the ground-rent, with all arrears,\r\nwas confirmed to Calcena by a royal cédula of December 23, 1509. There\r\nseems to have still been some obstacle to this reaction in the episcopal\r\nOrdinary, Francisco de Simancas, Archdeacon of Córdova for, in February,\r\n1510, Ferdinand wrote to the bishop that, without letting it be known\r\nthat the order came from the king, he must be replaced with some one\r\nzealous for the furtherance of justice and, a month later, this command\r\nwas peremptorily repeated. It is true that the extravagant wickedness of\r\nLucero was scarce to be dreaded, but, with a tribunal reconstructed\r\nunder such auspices, the people of Córdova could not hope for justice\r\ntempered with mercy and its productive activity is evidenced by the\r\nlarge drafts made, in 1510, on its receiver of confiscations. We may\r\nassume that Ximenes looked on this with disfavor for, in a letter to\r\nFerdinand, after his return from the expedition to Oran in 1509, he\r\nsupplicates that the decision of the Congregation be maintained for he\r\nhas never infringed it and never intends to do so.[570]\r\n\r\nAs for the author of the evil, Lucero himself, he was sent in chains to\r\nBurgos with some of his accomplices. Ximenes, as inquisitor-general, had\r\nfull power, as we have seen, to dismiss and punish them but, for some\r\noccult reason, a papal commission for their trial was applied for. This\r\ncaused delay under which Ferdinand chafed, for he wrote, September 30,\r\n1509, to his ambassador complaining that it caused great inconvenience\r\nand ordering him to urge the pope to issue it at once so that it could\r\nbe sent by the first courier.[571] When it came, it empowered the\r\nSuprema to try the case and Ferdinand, who warmly espoused Lucero's\r\ncause, expressed his feelings unequivocally in a letter of April 7,\r\n1510--\"the prisoners say that they have been long in prison and those\r\nwho informed against them have gone to Portugal or other parts, and\r\nothers have been burnt or penanced as heretics, showing clearly that\r\nthey testified falsely, and they supplicate me to provide that their\r\ntrial be by inquisitorial and not by accusatorial process, so that they\r\nshall not be exposed to greater infamy than hitherto by dead or perjured\r\nwitnesses, especially as the law provides that the trial be summary and\r\ndirected only to reach the truth. There is great compassion for their\r\nlong imprisonment and suffering, wherefore I beg and charge you to look\r\nwell into the matter and treat it conscientiously and with diligence for\r\nits speedy termination, with which I shall be well pleased.\"[572]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INQUISITORIAL METHODS_]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this urgency the trial dragged on, much delay being caused\r\nby the difficulty of finding an advocate willing to undertake Lucero's\r\ndefence. The Suprema selected the Bachiller de la Torre, but he declined\r\nto serve and Ferdinand, on May 16th, expressed his fear that no one\r\nwould assume the duty. July 19th he writes that Lucero complains that he\r\nstill has no counsel and he suggests that, if none of the lawyers of the\r\nroyal court can be trusted, Doctor Juan de Orduña of Valladolid be\r\ncalled in and his fees be paid by the Inquisition. The suggestion was\r\nadopted and, on August 20th, Ferdinand wrote personally to Orduña\r\nordering him to take charge of the defence and see that Lucero suffered\r\nno wrong, and at, the same time, he wrote to the University of\r\nValladolid to give Orduña the requisite leave of absence. Under this\r\nroyal pressure, and considering that the adverse witnesses had been\r\nlargely burnt or frightened into flight, it is perhaps rather creditable\r\nto the Suprema that it ventured to dismiss Lucero, without inflicting\r\nfurther punishment on him. He retired to the Seville canonry, which he\r\nhad acquired by the ruin of the Archdeacon of Castro, and there he ended\r\nhis days in peace. In 1514, Ferdinand manifested his undiminished\r\nsympathy by a gift of 15,000 mrs. to Juan Carrasco, the former _portero_\r\nof the tribunal of Córdova, to indemnify him for losses and sufferings\r\nwhich he claimed to have endured in the rising of 1506.[573] Yet before\r\nwe utterly condemn him for his share in this nefarious business we\r\nshould make allowance for the influence of Lucero's accomplice, his\r\nsecretary Calcena, who was always at hand to poison his mind and draft\r\nhis letters. To the same malign obsession may doubtless also be\r\nattributed an order of Charles V, in 1519, requiring the Córdovan\r\nauthorities to bestow the first vacant scrivenership on Diego Marino,\r\nwho had been Lucero's notary.[574]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat Lucero was an exceptional monster may well be admitted, but when\r\nsuch wickedness could be safely perpetrated for years and only be\r\nexposed and ended through the accidental intervention of Philip and\r\nJuana, it may safely be assumed that the temptations of secrecy and\r\nirresponsibility rendered frightful abuses, if not universal at least\r\nfrequent. The brief reign of Philip led other sorely vexed communities\r\nto appeal to the sovereigns for relief, and some of their memorials have\r\nbeen preserved. One from Jaen relates that the tribunal of that city\r\nprocured from Lucero a useful witness whom for five years he had kept in\r\nthe prison of Córdova to swear to what was wanted. His name was Diego de\r\nAlgeciras and, if the petitioners are to be believed, he was, in\r\naddition to being a perjurer, a drunkard, a gambler, a forger and a\r\nclipper of coins. This worthy was brought to Jaen and performed his\r\nfunctions so satisfactorily that the wealthiest Conversos were soon\r\nimprisoned. Two hundred wretches crowded the filthy gaol and it was\r\nrequisite to forbid the rest of the Conversos from leaving the city\r\nwithout a license. With Diego's assistance and the free use of torture,\r\non both accused and witnesses, it was not difficult to obtain whatever\r\nevidence was desired. The notary of the tribunal, Antonio de Barcena,\r\nwas especially successful in this. On one occasion he locked a young\r\ngirl of fifteen in a room, stripped her naked and scourged her until she\r\nconsented to bear testimony against her mother. A prisoner was carried\r\nin a chair to the auto de fe with his feet burnt to the bone; he and his\r\nwife were burnt alive and then two of their slaves were imprisoned and\r\nforced to give such evidence as was necessary to justify the execution.\r\nThe cells in which the unfortunates were confined in heavy chains were\r\nnarrow, dark, humid, filthy and overrun with vermin, while their\r\nsequestrated property was squandered by the officials, so that they\r\nnearly starved in prison while their helpless children starved outside.\r\nGranting that there may be exaggeration in this, the solid substratum of\r\ntruth is clear from the fact that the petitioners only asked that the\r\ntribunal be placed under the control of the Bishop of Jaen--that bishop\r\nbeing Alfonso Suárez de Fuentelsaz, one of Torquemada's inquisitors,\r\nwho had risen to be a colleague of Deza. He had not been a merciful\r\njudge, as many of his sentences attest, yet the miserable Conversos of\r\nJaen were ready to fly to him for relief.[575]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INQUISITORIAL METHODS_]\r\n\r\nA memorial from Arjona, a considerable town near Jaen, illustrates a\r\ndifferent phase of the subject. It relates that a certain Alvaro de\r\nEscalera of that place conspired with other evil men to report to the\r\ninquisitors of Jaen that there were numerous heretics in Arjona, so that\r\nwhen confiscations came to be sold they could buy the property cheap. In\r\ndue time an inquisitor came with the notary Barcena. No Term of Grace\r\nwas given, but the Edict of Faith was published, frightening the\r\ninhabitants with its fulminations unless they testified against their\r\nneighbors. Then a Dominican preached a fiery sermon to the effect that\r\nall Conversos were really Jews, whom it was the duty of Christians to\r\ndestroy. The inquisitors then sent for the slaves of the Conversos,\r\npromising them liberty if they would testify against their masters and\r\nassuring them of secrecy. The notary followed by traversing the town\r\nwith Escalera and his friends, proclaiming that there was a fine of ten\r\nreales on all who would not come forward with testimony, and the\r\nexaction of the fine from a number had a quickening influence on the\r\nmemories of others. Then a house to house canvass was made for evidence;\r\nthe women were told that it was impossible that they should not know the\r\nJewish tendencies of their neighbors; they could give what evidence they\r\npleased for their names would not be divulged; they were not obliged to\r\nprove it, for the accused had to disprove it. Those who would not talk\r\nwere threatened that they would be carried to Jaen and made to accuse\r\ntheir neighbors, and, in fact, a number were taken and compelled to give\r\nevidence in prison. Then the inquisitors departed with the accumulated\r\ntestimony; there was peace in Arjona for three months and the Conversos\r\nrecovered from their fright. Suddenly one night there arrived the\r\nnotary, the receiver and some officials; they quietly aroused the\r\nregidores and alcaldes and made them collect a force of armed men who\r\nwere stationed to guard the walls and gates. When morning came the work\r\nof arresting the suspects was commenced; their property was\r\nsequestrated, their houses locked and their children were turned into\r\nthe street, while the officials carried off their prisoners, who were\r\nthrust into the already crowded gaol of Jaen. The confiscations were\r\nauctioned off and those who had plotted the raid had ample opportunity\r\nof speculating in bargains.[576]\r\n\r\nStill other methods are detailed in a memorial from Llerena, the seat of\r\none of the older tribunals with jurisdiction over Extremadura. It stated\r\nthat for many years the Inquisition there had found little or nothing to\r\ndo, until there came a new judge, the Licenciado Bravo. He was a native\r\nof Fregenal, a town of the province, where he had bitter law-suits and\r\nactive enmities; he had had two months' training under Lucero at Córdova\r\nand he came armed with ample evidence gathered there. On his arrival,\r\nwithout waiting for formalities or further testimony, he made a large\r\nnumber of arrests and sent to Badajoz where he seized forty more and\r\nbrought them to Llerena. They were mostly men of wealth whose fortunes\r\nwere attractive objects of spoliation, and Bravo took care of his\r\nkindred by appointing them to positions in which they could appropriate\r\nmuch of the sequestrated property. The treatment of the prisoners was\r\nmost brutal, and when his colleague, Inquisitor Villart, who was not\r\nwholly devoid of compassion, was overheard remonstrating with him and\r\nsaying that the death of the captives would be on their souls, Bravo\r\ntold him to hold his peace, for he who had placed him there desired that\r\nthey should all die off, one by one. The petitioners were quite willing\r\nto be remitted to the tribunal of Seville or to have judges who would\r\npunish the guilty and discharge the innocent, but they earnestly begged,\r\nby the Passion of Christ, that they should not be left to the mercy of\r\nInquisitor-general Deza. Orders, they said, had been given to him to\r\nmitigate in some degree the sufferings of the people of Jaen, which he\r\nsuppressed and replaced with instructions to execute justice. What this\r\nmeant we may gather from a last despairing appeal, by the friends of the\r\nprisoners of Jaen, to Queen Juana; a junta of lawyers, they said, had\r\nbeen assembled, a scaffold of immense proportions was under\r\nconstruction; their only hope was in her and they entreated her to order\r\nthat no auto de fe be held until impartial persons should ascertain the\r\ntruth as to the miserable captives.[577] Juana was in no condition to\r\nrespond to this agonized prayer, and we may safely assume that greed and\r\ncruelty claimed their victims. These glimpses into the methods of the\r\ntribunals elucidate the statements of the Capitan Avora as to the\r\ndesolation spread over the land by the Inquisition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would seem that these fearful abuses were creating a general feeling\r\nof hostility to the institution and its officials, for Ferdinand deemed\r\nit necessary to issue a proclamation, January 19, 1510, calling upon all\r\nofficials, gentlemen and good citizens to furnish inquisitors and their\r\nsubordinates with lodgings and supplies at current prices and not to\r\nmaltreat or assail them, under penalty of 50,000 maravedís and\r\npunishment at the royal discretion. A month later, February 22d, we find\r\nhim writing to the constable of Castile that inquisitors are to visit\r\nthe districts of Burgos and Calahorra, and he asks the constable to give\r\norders that they may not be impeded. Somewhat similar instructions he\r\ngave in March to the provisor and corregidor of Cuenca, when the\r\ninquisitors of Cartagena were preparing to visit that portion of their\r\ndistrict, as though these special interpositions of the royal power were\r\nrequisite to ensure their comfort and safety in the discharge of their\r\nregular duties. Even these were sometimes ineffectual as was\r\nexperienced, in 1515, by the inquisitor Paradinas of Cartagena, who,\r\nwhile riding on his mule in the streets of Murcia, was set upon, stabbed\r\nand would have been killed but for assistance, while the assassins\r\nescaped, calling forth from Ferdinand the most emphatic orders for their\r\narrest and trial.[578]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _XIMENES ATTEMPTS REFORM_]\r\n\r\nYet, however rudely the Inquisition may have been shaken, it was too\r\nfirmly rooted in the convictions of the period and too energetically\r\nsupported by Ferdinand to be either destroyed or essentially reformed.\r\nWhen he died, January 23, 1516, his testament, executed the day\r\nprevious, laid strenuous injunctions on his grandson and successor\r\nCharles V--\"As all other virtues are nothing without faith, by which and\r\nin which we are saved, we command the said illustrious prince, our\r\ngrandson, to be always zealous in defending and exalting the Catholic\r\nfaith and that he aid, defend and favor the Church of God and labor,\r\nwith all his strength, to destroy and extirpate heresy from our kingdoms\r\nand lordships, selecting and appointing throughout them ministers,\r\nGod-fearing and of good conscience, who will conduct the Inquisition\r\njustly and properly, for the service of God and the exaltation of the\r\nCatholic faith, and who will also have great zeal for the destruction of\r\nthe sect of Mahomet.\"[579]\r\n\r\nWith his death, during the absence of his successor, the governing power\r\nwas lodged in the hands of Inquisitor-general Ximenes. From the papal\r\nbrief of August 18, 1509, alluded to above (p. 178), we may infer that\r\nhe had already endeavored to effect a partial reform, by dismissing some\r\nof the more obnoxious inquisitors, and he now made use of his authority\r\nto strike at those who had hitherto been beyond his reach. Aguirre was\r\none of these and another was the mercenary Calcena, concerning whom he\r\nwrote to Charles, December, 1516, that it was necessary that they should\r\nin future have nothing to do with the Inquisition in view of their foul\r\nexcesses. Another removal, of which we chance to have cognizance, was\r\nthat of Juan Ortiz de Zarate, the secretary of the Suprema. Whatever\r\nwere the failings of the inflexible Ximenes, pecuniary corruption was\r\nabhorrent to him and, during the short term of his supremacy in Castile,\r\nwe may feel assured that he showed no mercy to those who sought to coin\r\ninto money the blood of the Conversos.[580] With his death, however,\r\ncame a speedy return to the bad old ways. Adrian of Utrecht, though\r\nwell-intentioned, was weak and confiding. When appointed\r\nInquisitor-general of Aragon, he had made Calcena, February 12, 1517,\r\nsecretary of that Suprema and, after the death of Ximenes we find\r\nCalcena acting, in 1518, as royal secretary of the reunited Inquisition,\r\na position which he shared with Ugo de Urries, Lord of Ayerbe, another\r\nappointee of Adrian's, who long retained that position under Charles V.\r\nAguirre had the same good fortune, having been appointed by Adrian to\r\nmembership in the Suprema of Aragon and resuming his position in the\r\nreunited Inquisition after the death of Ximenes. His name occurs as\r\nsigned to documents as late as 1546, when he seems to be the senior\r\nmember.[581]\r\n\r\nFerdinand's dying exhortation to his grandson was needed. Charles V, a\r\nyouth of seventeen, was as clay in the hands of the potter, surrounded\r\nby grasping Flemish favorites, whose sole object, as far as concerned\r\nSpain, was to sell their influence to the highest bidder. During the\r\ninterval before his coming to take possession of his new dominions, he\r\nfluctuated in accordance with the pressure which happened momentarily to\r\nbe strongest. The Spaniards who came to his court gave fearful accounts\r\nof the Inquisition, which they said was ruining Spain, and we are told\r\nthat his counsellors were mostly Conversos who had obtained their\r\npositions by purchase.[582] In his prologue to his subsequent abortive\r\nproject of reform, Charles says that while in Flanders he received many\r\ncomplaints about the Inquisition, which he submitted to famous men of\r\nlearning and to colleges and universities, and his proposed action was\r\nin accordance with their advice.[583] Ximenes was alive to the danger\r\nand it was doubtless by his impulsion that the Council of Castile wrote\r\nto Charles that the peace of the kingdom and the maintenance of his\r\nauthority depended on his support of the Inquisition.[584] A more adroit\r\nmanoeuvre was the advantage which he took of the death, June 1, 1516,\r\nof Bishop Mercader, Inquisitor-general of Aragon. It would probably not\r\nhave been difficult for him to have reunited the Inquisitions of the two\r\ncrowns under his own headship, but he took the more politic course of\r\nurging Charles to nominate his old tutor, Adrian of Utrecht, then in\r\nSpain, as his representative, and to secure for him the succession to\r\nMercader's see of Tortosa. Charles willingly followed the advice; July\r\n30th he replied that in accordance with it he had written to Rome for\r\nthe commission; November 14th Pope Leo commissioned Adrian as\r\nInquisitor-general of Aragon, and we shall see hereafter how complete\r\nwas the ascendancy which he exercised over Charles in favor of the Holy\r\nOffice.[585]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COMPLAINTS OF THE CORTES_]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Charles continued to vacillate. At one time he proposed to\r\nbanish from his court all those of Jewish blood, and sent a list of\r\nnames in cypher with instructions to report their genealogies, to which\r\nthe Suprema of Aragon replied, October 27, 1516, with part of the\r\ninformation, promising to furnish the rest and expressing great\r\ngratification at his promises of aid and support in all things.[586]\r\nThen there came a rumor that he proposed to abolish the suppression of\r\nthe names of witnesses, which was one of the crowning atrocities of\r\ninquisitorial procedure. For this there must have been some foundation\r\nfor, March 11, 1517, Ximenes sent to his secretary Ayala a commission as\r\nprocurator of the Inquisition at Charles's court, with full power to\r\nresist any attempt to restrict or impede it, and he followed this, March\r\n17th, with a letter to Charles, more vigorous than courtly, telling him\r\nthat such a measure would be the destruction of the Inquisition and\r\nwould cover his name with infamy; Ferdinand and Isabella, when in\r\nstraits for money during the war with Granada, had refused 1,200,000\r\nducats for such a concession, and Ferdinand had subsequently rejected an\r\noffer of 400,000.[587]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OFFERS OF THE NEW CHRISTIANS_]\r\n\r\nIt can readily be imagined that, in spite of the character of Ximenes,\r\nthe death of Ferdinand and the uncertainty as to the views of the\r\ndistant sovereign had sensibly diminished the awe felt for the\r\nInquisition. There is an indication of this in a complaint made by the\r\nSuprema, in September, 1517, that, when it moved with the court from\r\nplace to place, the alcaldes of the palace refused to furnish mules and\r\nwagons to transport its books and papers and personnel, or, at most,\r\nonly did so after all the other departments of the government had been\r\nsupplied.[588] There is significance also in a tumult occurring in\r\nOrihuela, in 1517, when the inquisitors of Cartagena made a visitation\r\nthere, obliging the Licenciado Salvatierra to invoke the royal\r\nintervention.[589] The Conversos, though decimated and impoverished,\r\nstill had money and influence and the abuses which Ximenes had not been\r\nable to eradicate still excited hostility. When Charles, after his\r\narrival in Spain, in September, 1517, held his first Córtes at\r\nValladolid in 1518, the deputies petitioned him to take such order that\r\njustice should be done by the Inquisition, so that the wicked alone\r\nshould be punished and the innocent not suffer; that the canons and the\r\ncommon law should be observed; that the inquisitors should be of gentle\r\nblood, of good conscience and repute and of the age required by law,\r\nand, finally, that episcopal Ordinaries should be judges in conformity\r\nwith justice.[590] Although drawn in general terms this formal complaint\r\nindicates that the people felt the Holy Office to be an engine of\r\noppression, for the furtherance of the private ends of the officials,\r\nto the disregard of law and justice. Charles made reply that he would\r\nconsult learned and saintly men, with whose advice he would so provide\r\nthat injustice should cease and meanwhile he would receive memorials as\r\nto abuses and projects of reform. The deputies made haste to give him\r\nample information as to the tribulations of his subjects and the injury\r\nresulting to his dominions, and the outcome of the consultations of his\r\nadvisers was a series of instructions to the officials of the\r\nInquisition which, if carried into effect, would have deprived the Holy\r\nOffice of much of its efficiency for persecution as well as of its\r\ncapacity for injustice. Peter Martyr tells us that the New Christians,\r\nto procure this, gave to the high chancellor, Jean le Sauvage, who was a\r\nthoroughly corrupt man, ten thousand ducats in hand, with a promise of\r\nten thousand more when it should go into effect, but that, fortunately\r\nfor the Inquisition, he fell sick towards the end of May and died early\r\nin July.[591] The Instructions had been finally engrossed and lacked\r\nonly the signatures; they were drawn in the names of Charles and Juana\r\nand were addressed not only to the officials of the Inquisition but to\r\nthose of the state and secular justice, but nothing more was heard of\r\nthem, for the new chancellor, Mercurino di Gattinara, was a man of\r\ndifferent stamp, and Charles as yet was swayed by the influences\r\nsurrounding him. The elaborate project is therefore of no interest\r\nexcept as an acknowledgement, in its provisions for procedure, of the\r\niniquity of the inquisitorial process as we shall see it hereafter, and,\r\nin its prohibitory clauses, that existing abuses exaggerated in every\r\nway the capacity for evil of the system as practised. Thus it prohibited\r\nthat the salaries of the inquisitors should be dependent on the\r\nconfiscations and fines which they pronounced, or that grants should be\r\nmade to them from confiscated property or benefices of those whom they\r\ncondemned, or that sequestrated property should be granted away before\r\nthe condemnation of its owners; that inquisitors and officials abusing\r\ntheir positions should be merely transferred to other places instead of\r\nbeing duly punished; that those who complained of the tribunals should\r\nbe arrested and maltreated; that those who appealed to the Suprema\r\nshould be maltreated; that inquisitors should give information to those\r\nseeking grants as to the property of prisoners still under trial; that\r\nprisoners under trial should be debarred from hearing mass and receiving\r\nthe sacraments; that those condemned to perpetual prison should be\r\nallowed to die of starvation.[592] The general tenor of these provisions\r\nindicate clearly what a tremendous stimulus to persecution and injustice\r\nwas confiscation as a punishment of heresy, how the whole business of\r\nthe Inquisition was degraded from its ostensible purpose of purifying\r\nthe faith into a vile system of spoliation, and how those engaged in it\r\nwere inevitably vitiated by the tempting opportunity of filthy gains.\r\n\r\nAlthough Charles, on the death of his chancellor, dropped the proposed\r\nreform, he seems to have recognized the existence of these evils. When\r\nhis Inquisitor-general, Cardinal Adrian, was elevated to the papacy in\r\n1522, he sent from Flanders his chamberlain La Chaulx to congratulate\r\nhim before he should leave Spain, and among the envoy's instructions was\r\nthe suggestion that he should be careful in his appointments and provide\r\nproper means to prevent the Inquisition from punishing the innocent and\r\nits officials from thinking more about the property of the condemned\r\nthan the salvation of their souls--a pious wish but perfectly futile so\r\nlong as the methods of the institution were unchanged, and its expenses\r\nwere to be met and its officials enriched by fines and\r\nconfiscations.[593]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OFFERS OF THE NEW CHRISTIANS_]\r\n\r\nThe sufferers had long recognized this and offers had more than once\r\nbeen vainly made to Ferdinand to compound for the royal right of\r\nconfiscation--offers of which we know no details. With the failure of\r\nthe comprehensive scheme of reform, this plan was revived and, before\r\nCharles left Spain, May 21, 1520, to assume the title of King of the\r\nRomans, a formal proposition was made to him to the effect that if\r\njustice should be secured in the Inquisition, by appointing judges free\r\nfrom suspicion who should observe the law, so that the innocent might\r\nlive secure and the wicked be punished and the papal ordinances be\r\nobeyed, there were persons who would dare to serve him as follows.\r\nConsidering that greed is the parent of all evils; that it is the law of\r\nthe Partidas that the property of those having Catholic children should\r\nnot be confiscated[594] and further that the royal treasury derived\r\nvery little profit from the confiscations, as they were all consumed in\r\nthe salaries and costs of the judges and receivers who enriched\r\nthemselves, his Majesty could well benefit himself by a composition and\r\nsale of all his rights therein, for himself and his descendants for\r\never, obtaining from the pope a bull prohibiting confiscations and\r\npecuniary penances and fines. If this were done the parties pledged\r\nthemselves to provide rents sufficient, with those that Ferdinand had\r\nassigned towards that purpose, to defray all the salaries and costs of\r\nthe Inquisition, on a basis to be defined by Charles. Moreover, they\r\nwould pay him four hundred thousand ducats--one hundred thousand before\r\nhis departure and the balance in three equal annual payments at the fair\r\nof Antwerp in May. Or, if he preferred not to do this in perpetuity, he\r\ncould limit the term, for which two hundred thousand ducats would be\r\npaid, in similar four instalments. For the collection of the sum to meet\r\nthese engagements there must be letters and provisions such as the\r\nCatholic king gave for the compositions of Andalusia, and it must be\r\ncommitted in Castile to the Archbishop of Toledo (Cardinal de Croy), and\r\nin Aragon to the Archbishop of Saragossa (Alfonso de Aragon) from whose\r\ndecisions there was to be no appeal. But to furnish the necessary\r\npersonal security for the fulfilment of this offer, it was significantly\r\nadded that it would be necessary for the king and Cardinal Adrian to\r\ngive safe-conducts to the parties, protecting them from prosecution by\r\nthe Inquisition and these must be issued in the current month of October\r\nso that there might be time to raise the money.[595] It is scarce\r\nnecessary to say that this proposition was unsuccessful. Charles was\r\nunder the influence of Cardinal Adrian and Adrian was controlled by his\r\ncolleagues. It was asking too much of inquisitors that they should agree\r\nto allow themselves to be restricted to the impartial administration of\r\nthe cruel laws against heresy, to be content with salaries and forego\r\nthe opportunities of peculation. It was also in vain that the Córtes of\r\nCoruña, in 1520, repeated the request of those of Valladolid for a\r\nreform in procedure.[596] Charles sailed for Flanders leaving his\r\nsubjects exposed to all the evils under which they had groaned so long.\r\nThere were still occasional ebullitions of resistance for, in 1520,\r\nwhen the tribunal of Cuenca arrested the deputy corregidor it gave rise\r\nto serious troubles and Inquisitor Mariano of Toledo was despatched\r\nthither with his servants and familiars to restore peace, a task which\r\noccupied him for five months.[597]\r\n\r\nA still further project for mitigating the rigors of the Inquisition was\r\nlaid before Charles in 1520, apparently after his arrival in Flanders.\r\nThis proposed no payment, but suggested that the expenses should be\r\ndefrayed by the crown, which should wholly withdraw the confiscations\r\nfrom the control of the inquisitors. With this were connected various\r\nreforms in procedure--revealing the names of witnesses, allowing the\r\naccused to select his advocate and to see his friends and family in\r\npresence of the gaoler, the punishment of false witness by the _talio_,\r\nthe support of wife and children during the trial from the sequestrated\r\nproperty and some others.[598] There would seem also, about 1522, to\r\nhave been a further offer to Charles of seven hundred thousand ducats\r\nfor the abandonment of confiscation, but it does not appear what\r\nconditions accompanied it.[599] It was all useless. The grasp of the\r\nInquisition on Spain was too firm and its routine too well established\r\nfor modification.\r\n\r\nIn the revolt of the Comunidades, which followed the departure of\r\nCharles, the affairs of the Inquisition had no participation. Some ten\r\nyears later, however, in 1531, the tribunal of Toledo came upon traces\r\nof an attempt to turn the popular movement to account in removing one of\r\nthe atrocities of inquisitorial procedure. The treasurer, Alfonso\r\nGutiérrez, is said to have spent in Rome some twelve thousand ducats in\r\nprocuring a papal brief which removed the seal of secrecy from prisons\r\nand witnesses. He endeavored to secure for his scheme the favor of Juan\r\nde Padilla, the popular leader, by a loan of eight hundred ducats on the\r\npledge of a gold chain, but Padilla, while accepting the loan, prudently\r\nrefused to jeopardize his cause by arousing inquisitorial\r\nhostility.[600]\r\n\r\nWhat Gutiérrez failed to obtain was sought for again from Charles V in\r\n1526. About this time commenced the efforts to subject the Moriscos of\r\nGranada to the Holy Office and apparently in preparation for this\r\nGranada was separated from Córdova and was favored with a tribunal of\r\nits own, transferred thither from Jaen. The frightened inhabitants made\r\nhaste to petition Charles to do away with the secrecy which was so\r\npeculiarly provocative of abuses. They pointed out that a judge, if\r\nlicentiously disposed, had ample opportunity to work his will with the\r\nmaidens and wives brought before him as prisoners and even with those\r\nmerely summoned to appear, whose terror betrayed that they would dare to\r\noffer no resistance. In the same way the notaries and other\r\nsubordinates, who were frequently unmarried men, had every advantage\r\nwith the wives and daughters of the prisoners, eagerly seeking to obtain\r\nsome news of the accused, immured _incomunicado_ in the secret prison,\r\nfrom which no word could escape, and ready, in their despairing anxiety,\r\nto make any sacrifice to learn his fate. Or, if the officials preferred,\r\nthey could sell information for money and all this was so generally\r\nunderstood that these positions were sought by evil-minded men in order\r\nto gratify their propensities. Bad as was this, still worse was the\r\nsuppression of the witnesses' names in procuring the conviction of the\r\ninnocent while facilitating the escape of the guilty. The memorial\r\nassumes, what was practically the fact, that the only defence of the\r\naccused lay in guessing the names of the adverse witnesses and\r\ndiscrediting and disabling them for mortal enmity, and it pointed out\r\nhow, in diverse ways, this facilitated miscarriage of justice. It did\r\nnot confine itself to argument, however, but added that the little\r\nkingdom of Granada would pay fifty thousand ducats for the removal of\r\nsecrecy from the procedure and prisons of the Inquisition, and that a\r\nvery large sum could be thus obtained from the other provinces of\r\nSpain.[601] The only possible answer to the reasoning of the memorial\r\nwas that the faith would suffer by any change, but this always sufficed\r\nand the Inquisition continued to shroud its acts in the impenetrable\r\ndarkness which served to cover up iniquity and give ample scope for\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NAVARRE_]\r\n\r\nWhen Charles had returned to Spain and again held the Córtes at\r\nValladolid, in 1523, they repeated the petitions of 1518 and 1520,\r\nadding that nothing had been done. They further suggested that\r\ninquisitors should be paid salaries by the king and not draw their pay\r\nfrom the proceeds of their functions, and that false witnesses should be\r\npunished in accordance with the Laws of Toro. This shows that the old\r\nabuses were felt as acutely as ever, but Charles merely replied that he\r\nhad asked the pope to commission as inquisitor-general the Archbishop of\r\nSeville, Manrique, whom he had especially charged to see that justice\r\nwas properly administered. Again, in 1525, the Córtes of Toledo\r\ncomplained of the excesses of the inquisitors and the disorders\r\ncommitted by the familiars and asked that the secular judges might be\r\nempowered to restrain abuses, but they obtained only a vague promise\r\nthat, if abuses existed, he would have them corrected.[602] It required\r\nno little courage for deputies to arraign the Inquisition publicly in\r\nthe Córtes, and it is not surprising that the hardihood to do so\r\ndisappeared with the recognition of the fruitlessness of remonstrance.\r\n\r\nThus all efforts proved futile to mitigate or ameliorate inquisitorial\r\nmethods, and the Holy Office, in its existing form, was firmly\r\nestablished in Castile for three centuries momentous to the Spanish\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVARRE.\r\n\r\nWhen Ferdinand, in 1512, made the easy conquest of Navarre he presumably\r\nno longer had hope of issue by his Queen Germaine, to whom he could\r\nleave the kingdoms of his crown of Aragon. To avoid, therefore, for the\r\nnew territory the limitations on sovereignty imposed by the Aragonese\r\nfueros, in the Córtes of Burgos, in 1515, he caused Navarre to be\r\nincorporated with the crown of Castile.[603] Its Inquisition thus\r\nfinally became Castilian, although at first it was scarce more than a\r\nbranch of that of Saragossa.\r\n\r\nWhen the Castilian invaders under the Duke of Alva occupied Pampeluna\r\nthey found there the Dominican friar, Antonio de Maya, armed with a\r\ncommission as inquisitor, issued by his provincial and confirmed by the\r\npope. The office had doubtless been a sinecure under the House of\r\nAlbret, but the transfer of the land to the Catholic king gave promise\r\nof its future usefulness, for the little kingdom had served as an asylum\r\nfor refugees from the rest of Spain. The good fraile lost no time in\r\nobtaining from Alva permission to exercise his office and in despatching\r\nan envoy to Ferdinand at Logroño to secure the royal confirmation and\r\nsuggest the necessity of appointing a staff of salaried officials.\r\nBesides, the episcopal vicar-general of Pampeluna was seeking to\r\nexercise the office, and the king was asked to order him not to\r\ninterfere. Ferdinand, with his usual caution, wrote on September 30,\r\n1512, to the Duke of Alva, as captain-general, and to the Bishop of\r\nMajorca as governor, expressing his earnest desire to forward the good\r\nwork and desiring information as to the character of Maya; meanwhile, if\r\nthe inquisitors of Saragossa sent to claim fugitives, they were to be\r\npromptly surrendered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NAVARRE_]\r\n\r\nNo further action was taken for a year, during which Fray Maya did what\r\nhe could in the absence of assistance. At length a royal letter of\r\nSeptember 26, 1513, to the Marquis of Comares, lieutenant and\r\ncaptain-general, announced that Inquisitor-general Mercader had\r\nappointed as inquisitors Francisco González de Fresneda, one of the\r\ninquisitors of Saragossa, and Fray Antonio de Maya, to whom the\r\ncustomary oath of obedience was to be taken; the only other official\r\ndesignated was Jaime Julian, as _escribano de secuestras_, with a salary\r\nof 2500 sueldos. Further delays, however, occurred and, on December\r\n21st, the king wrote to Fresneda to lose no time in going to Pampeluna\r\nwith his officials, where he would find Maya awaiting him. On the 24th a\r\nproclamation announced that Leo X had ordered the continuance of the\r\nInquisition in all the kingdoms of Spain and especially in that of\r\nNavarre, wherefore in order that dread of loss of property might not\r\ndeter those conscious of guilt from coming forward and confessing, the\r\nking granted release from confiscation to all who would confess and\r\napply for reconciliation within the Term of Grace of thirty days which\r\nthe inquisitors would announce. As a preparation for those who should\r\ndisregard this mercy, already, on the 22d, Martin Adrian had been\r\ncommissioned to the important office of receiver of the confiscations\r\nwhich were expected to supply the funds for the machinery of persecution\r\nand, on January 1, 1514, he was empowered to pay himself a salary of\r\n6000 sueldos and one of 3000 to Fray Maya. As nothing is said about the\r\nsalaries of the other officials, they presumably were carried on the\r\npay-roll of the tribunal of Saragossa. The process of manning the new\r\nInquisition was conducted with great deliberation. It was not until July\r\n13, 1514, that receiver Adrian was informed that Bishop Mercader had\r\nappointed Juan de Villena as fiscal, or prosecuting officer, to whom a\r\nsalary of 2500 sueldos was to be paid. The close connection of the\r\ntribunal of Pampeluna with that of Aragon is seen in the fact that\r\nAdrian was also notary of the Inquisition of Calatayud and continued in\r\nservice there for which he received his accustomed salary. Juan de\r\nMiades, also, the alguazil of Saragossa, was put in charge of the prison\r\nat Pampeluna, for which he was allowed an additional salary of 500\r\nsueldos, until, October 15, 1515, Bernardino del Campo, of Saragossa,\r\nwas appointed gaoler at Pampeluna with a salary of 500 sueldos. We also\r\nhear of Miguel Daoyz, notary _del secreto_ of Saragossa acting for the\r\nInquisition of Pampeluna. This may partly be attributable to Ferdinand's\r\npolicy, as expressed, March 23, 1514, in a letter to the Marquis of\r\nComares, that the officials must not be Navarrese, for he had elsewhere\r\nexperienced the disadvantage of employing natives. More urgent, however,\r\nwas the pressure of economy, for the Pampeluna Inquisition had\r\napparently little to do; Navarre had never had a population of Moors and\r\nJews comparable to that of the southern kingdoms and the refugees there\r\ndoubtless hastened their departure as soon as the shadow of the\r\nInquisition spread over the land, although one of the earliest orders of\r\nFerdinand to Comares, December 21, 1513, had been to place guards\r\nsecretly at all ports and passes to prevent their escape. How little\r\nmaterial existed for the Holy Office is manifested by the fact that the\r\nconfiscations did not pay the very moderate expenses and in May, 1515,\r\nit was necessary to transfer from Valencia two hundred ducats to enable\r\nMartin Adrian to meet the necessary charges. In September, 1514, we find\r\nthe inquisitors making a visitation of their district and, in the\r\nfollowing month, Fray Maya returned to the seclusion of his convent, but\r\nof the actual work of the tribunal we hear little. It is true that a\r\nletter of the Suprema, October 11, 1516, respecting the collection of a\r\npenance of 300 ducats imposed on Miguel de Sant Jaime shows that\r\noccasionally a lucrative prize was secured, but chances of this kind\r\nmust have been few for, in 1521, Cardinal Adrian, in view of the\r\nnecessities of the tribunal, ruthlessly cut down the salaries of all the\r\nofficials. Its authority cannot have been well assured for, in 1518, the\r\nViceroy, Duke of Najera, expresses doubts whether a sentence of\r\nsanbenitos, pronounced on Rodrigo de Osca and his wife, of Pampeluna,\r\ncan be enforced, in view of their numerous kindred, to which the Suprema\r\nreplies by instructing him to see that nothing is allowed to impede it.\r\nLittle as it had to do, the business of the tribunal was delayed by its\r\nimperfect organization. In 1519 eight citizens of Pampeluna complained\r\nto the Suprema that, for trifling causes, their fathers and mothers,\r\nwives and brothers, were in the prison of the Inquisition, where three\r\nof them had died and the rest were sick. They had been detained for\r\nseven or eight months, although their cases were finished, awaiting\r\n_consultores_ from Saragossa to vote on them, wherefore the petitioners\r\nasked that decisions be reached without further delay and that, when\r\ndischarged, the prisoners should not be ruined by pecuniary penances\r\ngreater than their substance, as had occurred on previous occasions. The\r\nSuprema, January 12, 1519, forwarded this petition to the inquisitors\r\nwith instructions that, within fifteen days, one of them should bring to\r\nSaragossa all the cases concluded, to be duly voted on, while the\r\nremainder were to be finished as soon as possible and within fifteen\r\ndays thereafter to be similarly brought to Saragossa for decision. As in\r\nthis letter the Council describes itself as entrusted with the business\r\nof the Inquisition in all the kingdoms and lordships of the crown of\r\nAragon and Navarre, it shows that the latter still remained subject to\r\nthe section of the Suprema pertaining to Aragon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NAVARRE_]\r\n\r\nWhile the tribunal of Pampeluna was thus of little service for its\r\nostensible objects, it was turned to account politically in the\r\nperturbations which followed the death of Ferdinand, January 23, 1516.\r\nJean d'Albret, supported by France, naturally made an effort to recover\r\nhis dominions, but his ineffective siege of Saint-Jean-Pied-du-Port, and\r\nthe defeat and capture of the Marshal of Navarre at Roncesvalles,\r\nspeedily put an end to the invasion. It was important for the Spanish\r\ngovernment to ascertain the extent to which assistance had been pledged\r\nto him by his former subjects. The Inquisition was unpopular among them\r\nand would undoubtedly have been overthrown had d'Albret succeeded, so\r\nthat an investigation into those concerned in the movement could come\r\nwithin an elastic definition of its functions, while its methods fitted\r\nit admirably to obtain the information desired. Accordingly a cédula of\r\nApril 21, 1516, instructed the inquisitors to spare no effort, in every\r\nway, to discover the names of those engaged in the affair and to obtain\r\nall the information they could about the whole matter. This probably did\r\nnot increase the popularity of the Holy Office and the French invasion\r\nof 1521 offered an opportunity, which was not neglected, of expressing\r\nin action the hostility of the people. After the expulsion of the enemy,\r\nreprisals were in order which Cardinal Adrian committed to the Precentor\r\nof Tudela. Apparently he was not sufficiently vigorous in the work for,\r\nin 1523, we find the Suprema stimulating him to greater activity.[604]\r\n\r\nSpanish domination being thus assured, the Navarrese tribunal became\r\nuseful chiefly as a precaution to prevent the subject kingdom from\r\ncontinuing to be an asylum for heretics. It had been shifted from\r\nPampeluna to Estella and thence to Tudela, where, in 1518, the Suprema\r\ninstructs the inquisitors to find a suitable building, in order to\r\nrelieve the monastery of San Francisco in which the tribunal was\r\ntemporarily lodged. Some years later there was talk of returning it to\r\nPampeluna, but finally it was recognized as having a district inadequate\r\nto its support, while the monarchy felt itself strong enough to\r\ndisregard the old boundaries of nationality. At some time prior to 1540,\r\nCalahorra, with a portion of Old Castile, was detached from the enormous\r\ndistrict of Valladolid and was made the seat of a tribunal of which the\r\njurisdiction extended over Navarre and Biscay. About 1570 this was\r\ntransferred to Logroño, on the boundary between Old Castile and Navarre,\r\nand there it remained, as we shall have occasion to see, until the\r\ndissolution of the Holy Office.[605]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE KINGDOMS OF ARAGON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crown of Aragon comprised the so-called kingdoms of Aragon and\r\nValencia, the principality of Catalonia, the counties of Rosellon and\r\nCerdana, and the Balearic Isles, with the outlying dependencies of\r\nSicily, Sardinia and Corsica. Although marriage had united the\r\nsovereigns of Castile and Aragon, the particularism born of centuries of\r\nrivalry and frequent war kept the lands jealously apart as separate\r\nnations and Ferdinand ruled individually his ancestral dominions. What\r\nhad been accomplished in Castile for the Inquisition had therefore no\r\neffect across the border and the extension of the Spanish organization\r\nthere was complicated by the character of the local institutions and the\r\nfact that the papal Inquisition was already in existence there since its\r\nfoundation in the middle of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nAragon had not undergone the dissolving process of Castilian anarchy\r\nwhich enabled Ferdinand and Isabella to build up an absolute monarchy on\r\nthe ruins of feudalism. Its ancient rights and liberties had been\r\nsomewhat curtailed during the tyrannical reigns of Ferdinand of\r\nAntequera and his successors, but enough remained to render the royal\r\npower nominal rather than real and the people were fiercely jealous of\r\ntheir independence. The Córtes were really representative bodies which\r\ninsisted upon the redress of grievances before voting supplies and, if\r\nwe may believe the Venetian envoy, Giovanni Soranzo, in 1565, the\r\nancient formula of the oath of allegiance was still in use: \"We, who are\r\nas good as you, swear to you who are no better than we, as to the prince\r\nand heir of our kingdom, on condition that you preserve our liberty and\r\nlaws and if you do otherwise we do not swear to you.\"[606]\r\n\r\nIn dealing with a people whose liberties were so extensive and whose\r\njealousy as to their maintenance was so sensitive, Ferdinand was far too\r\nshrewd to provoke opposition by the abrupt introduction of the\r\nInquisition such as he had forced upon Castile. His first endeavor\r\nnaturally was to utilize the institution as it had so long existed.\r\nThis, although founded as early as 1238, had sunk into a condition\r\nalmost dormant in the spiritual lethargy of the century preceding the\r\nReformation, and in Aragon, as in the rest of Europe, it appeared to be\r\non the point of extinction. It is true that, in 1474, Sixtus IV had\r\nordered Fra Leonardo, the Dominican General, to fill all the tribunals\r\nof the Holy Office and he had complied by appointing Fray Juan as\r\nInquisitor of Aragon, Fray Jaime for Valencia, Fray Juan for Barcelona\r\nand Fray Francisco Vital for Catalonia, but we have no record of their\r\nactivity.[607] So little importance, indeed, was attached to the\r\nfunctions of the Inquisition that in Valencia, where in 1480 the\r\nDominicans Cristóbal de Gualbes and Juan Orts were inquisitors, they\r\nheld faculties enabling them to act without the concurrence of the\r\nepiscopal representative--an unexampled privilege, only explicable on\r\nthe assumption that the archbishop declined to be troubled with matters\r\nso trivial. The archbishop at the time was Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia,\r\npapal vice-chancellor, better known as Alexander VI, who speedily woke\r\nup to the speculative value of his episcopal jurisdiction over heresy,\r\nwhen the fierce persecution, which arose in Andalusia in January, 1481,\r\nwith its attendant harvest of fines and compositions, showed that a\r\nsimilar prospect might be anticipated in his own province. Accordingly a\r\nbrief of Sixtus IV, December 4, 1481, addressed to the inquisitors,\r\nwithdrew their faculties of independent action and went to the other\r\nextreme by directing them in future to do nothing without the\r\nconcurrence of the vicar-general, Mateo Mercader, senior archdeacon of\r\nValencia.[608]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REVIVAL OF OLD INQUISITION_]\r\n\r\nIn reviving and stimulating to activity this papal institution,\r\nFerdinand was fully resolved to have it subjected to the crown as\r\ncompletely as in Castile. Hitherto it had been a Dominican province,\r\nwith inquisitors holding office at the pleasure of the Dominican\r\nauthorities and his first step therefore was to procure, in 1481, from\r\nthe Dominican General, Salvo Caseta, a commission to Fray Gaspar Juglar\r\nto appoint and dismiss inquisitors at the royal will and pleasure.[609]\r\nThis gave him control over the personnel of the Inquisition, but to\r\nrender it completely dependent and at the same time efficient, it was\r\nnecessary that the appointees should be well paid and that the pay\r\nshould come from the royal treasury. A hundred years earlier, Eymerich,\r\nthe Inquisitor of Aragon, had sorrowfully recorded that princes were\r\nunwilling to defray the expenses, because there were no rich heretics\r\nleft whose confiscations excited their cupidity; the Church was equally\r\ndisinclined, so that, in the absence of regular financial support, the\r\ngood work languished.[610] Now, however, greed and fanaticism joined\r\nhands at the prospect of wealthy Conversos to be punished and Ferdinand,\r\nby a rescript of February 17, 1482, provided ample salaries for the\r\nmanning of the tribunal of Valencia, with all the necessary\r\nofficials.[611] We may reasonably assume that he commenced there in the\r\nanticipation of meeting less obstinate resistance than in the older and\r\nstronger provinces of Aragon and Catalonia. He was, however, not yet\r\nfully satisfied with his control over appointments and he applied to\r\nSixtus IV for some larger liberty, but the pope, who was beginning to\r\nrecognize that the Castilian Inquisition was more royal than papal,\r\nrefused, by a brief of January 29, 1482, alleging that to do so would be\r\nto inflict disgrace on the Dominicans to whom it had always been\r\nconfided.[612]\r\n\r\nThe reorganized tribunal speedily produced an impression by its\r\nactivity. The Conversos became thoroughly alarmed; opposition began to\r\nmanifest itself, while the more timid sought safety in flight. A certain\r\nMossen Luis Masquo, one of the jurats of Valencia, made himself\r\nespecially conspicuous in exciting the city against the inquisitors and\r\nin stimulating united action in opposition by the Estates of the\r\nkingdom. A letter to him from Ferdinand, February 8, 1482, censures him\r\nseverely for this and vaguely threatens him with the royal wrath for\r\npersistence. Another letter of the same date to the Maestre Racional, or\r\nchief accounting officer of the kingdom, shows that the severity with\r\nwhich the property of those arrested was seized and sequestrated was\r\narousing indignation, for it explains the necessity of this so that not\r\na _diner_ shall be lost; if the inquisitors have not power to do this,\r\nit shall be conferred on them.[613] The Maestre Racional had suggested\r\nthat for those who should spontaneously come forward and confess a form\r\nof abjuration and reconciliation might be adopted which should spare\r\nthem the humiliation of public penance while still keeping them subject\r\nto the penalties of relapse. To this, after consultation with learned\r\ncanonists, Ferdinand assented and sent him the formula agreed upon, with\r\ninstructions that it should appear to be the act of the local\r\nauthorities and not his--doubtless to prevent his Castilian subjects\r\nfrom claiming the same exemption from the humiliating penitential\r\nprocessions in the autos de fe.[614]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PAPAL INTERFERENCE_]\r\n\r\nAllusions in this correspondence to special cases of arrests and\r\nfugitives and sequestrations show that Ferdinand was succeeding in\r\nmoulding the old Inquisition as he desired and that it was actively at\r\nwork, when suddenly a halt was called. In the general terror it is\r\npresumable that the Conversos had recourse to the Holy See and furnished\r\nthe necessary convincing arguments; it may also be conjectured that\r\nSixtus was disposed, by throwing obstacles in the way, to secure the\r\nrecognition of his profitable but disputed right to entertain appeals\r\nand that he was unwilling, without a struggle, to lose control of the\r\nInquisition of Aragon as he had done with that of Castile. There are\r\ntraces also of the hand of Cardinal Borgia seeking to recover his\r\nepiscopal jurisdiction over heresy in Valencia. Whatever may have been\r\nthe impelling cause, the first move of Sixtus was to cause the Dominican\r\nGeneral, Salvo Caseta, to withdraw the commission given to Fray Gaspar\r\nJuglar to appoint inquisitors at Ferdinand's dictation. At this the\r\nroyal wrath exploded in a letter to the General, April 26, 1482,\r\nthreatening the whole Order with the consequences of his displeasure;\r\nGualbes and Orts had done their duty fearlessly and incorruptibly, while\r\nFray Francisco Vital--appointed to Catalonia by the Dominican\r\nGeneral--had been taking bribes and had been banished the kingdom; he\r\nwill never allow inquisitors to act, except at his pleasure; even with\r\nthe royal favor they can accomplish little in the face of popular\r\nopposition and without it they can do nothing; meanwhile Gualbes and\r\nOrts will continue to act. This heated epistle was followed, May 11th,\r\nby one in a calmer mood, asking that Juglar's commission be renewed or\r\nanother one be issued, failing which he would obtain papal authority and\r\noverslaugh the Dominican Order.[615]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PAPAL INTERFERENCE_]\r\n\r\nThe next move by Sixtus was the issue, April 18, 1482, of the most\r\nextraordinary bull in the history of the Inquisition--extraordinary\r\nbecause, for the first time, heresy was declared to be, like any other\r\ncrime, entitled to a fair trial and simple justice. We shall have\r\nabundant opportunity to see hereafter how the inquisitorial system,\r\nobserved since its foundation in the thirteenth century, presumed the\r\nguilt of the accused on any kind of so-called evidence and was solely\r\nframed to extort a confession by depriving him of the legitimate means\r\nof defence and by the free use of torture. It was also an invariable\r\nrule that sacramental confession of heresy was good only in the forum of\r\nconscience and was no bar to subsequent prosecution. There was brazen\r\nassurance therefore in Sixtus's complaining that, for some time, the\r\ninquisitors of Aragon had been moved not by zeal for the faith but by\r\ncupidity; that many faithful Christians, on the evidence of slaves,\r\nenemies and unfit witnesses, without legitimate proofs, had been thrust\r\ninto secular prisons, tortured and condemned as heretics their property\r\nconfiscated and their persons relaxed to the secular arm for execution.\r\nIn view of the numerous complaints reaching him of this, he ordered that\r\nin future the episcopal vicars should in all cases be called in to act\r\nwith the inquisitors; that the names and evidence of accusers and\r\nwitnesses should be communicated to the accused, who should be allowed\r\ncounsel and that the evidence for the defence and all legitimate\r\nexceptions should be freely admitted; that imprisonment should be in the\r\nepiscopal gaols; that for all oppression there should be free appeal to\r\nthe Holy See, with suspension of proceedings, under pain of\r\nexcommunication removable only by the pope. Moreover, all who had been\r\nguilty of heresy should be permitted to confess secretly to the\r\ninquisitors or episcopal officials, who were required to hear them\r\npromptly and confer absolution, good in both the forum of conscience and\r\nthat of justice, without abjuration, on their accepting secret penance,\r\nafter which they could no longer be prosecuted for any previous acts, a\r\ncertificate being given to them in which the sins confessed were not to\r\nbe mentioned, nor were they to be vexed or molested thereafter in any\r\nway--and all this under similar pain of excommunication. The bull was\r\nordered to be read in all churches and the names of those incurring\r\ncensure under it were to be published and the censures enforced if\r\nnecessary by invocation of the secular arm; while finally all\r\nproceedings in contravention of these provisions were declared to be\r\nnull and void, all exceptions from excommunication were withdrawn and\r\nall conflicting papal decrees were set aside.[616] It is evident that\r\nthe Conversos had a hand in framing this measure and they could scarce\r\nhave asked for anything more favorable. In fact Ferdinand in December,\r\n1482, writes to Luis Cabanilles, Governor of Valencìa, that he learns\r\nthat Gonsalvo de Gonsalvo Royz was concerned in procuring the bull for\r\nthe Conversos: he is therefore to be arrested at once and is not to be\r\nreleased without a royal order, while Luis de Santangel, the royal\r\n_escribano de racion_, will convey orally the king's intentions\r\nconcerning him.[617]\r\n\r\nIn this elaborate and carefully planned decree Sixtus formally threw\r\ndown the gage of battle to Ferdinand and announced that he must be\r\nplacated in some way if the Inquisition of Aragon was to be allowed to\r\nperform its intended functions. That it was simply a tactical\r\nmove--rendered doubly advantageous by liberal Converso payment--and that\r\nhe is to be credited with no humanitarian motives, is sufficiently\r\nevident from his subsequent action and also from the fact that the bull\r\nwas limited to Aragon and in no way interfered with the Castilian\r\ntribunals. Ferdinand promptly accepted the challenge. He did not await\r\nthe publication of the bull but addressed, on May 13th, a haughty and\r\nimperative letter to Sixtus. He had heard, he said, that such\r\nconcessions had been made, which he briefly condensed in a manner to\r\nshow that his information was accurate, and further that the inquisitors\r\nGualbes and Orts had been removed, at the instance of the New Christians\r\nwho hoped for more pliable successors. He refused to believe that the\r\npope could have made grants so at variance with his duty but, if he had\r\nthus yielded to the cunning persuasions of the New Christians, he, the\r\nking, did not intend ever to allow them to take effect. If anything had\r\nbeen conceded it must be revoked; the management of the Inquisition must\r\nbe left to him; he must have the appointment of the inquisitors, as only\r\nthrough his favor could they adequately perform their functions; it was\r\nthrough lack of this royal power that they had hitherto been corrupted\r\nand had allowed heresy to spread. He therefore asked Sixtus to confirm\r\nGualbes and Orts and the commission to Gaspar Juglar, or to give a\r\nsimilar commission to some other Dominican, for he would permit no one\r\nto exercise the office in his dominions except at his pleasure.[618]\r\n\r\nSixtus seems to have allowed five months to elapse before answering this\r\ndefiance, but in the meanwhile the Inquisition went on as before.\r\nFerdinand had formed in Valencia a special council for the Holy Office\r\nand this body ventured to remonstrate with him about the confiscations\r\nand especially the feature of sequestration, by which, as soon as an\r\narrest was made, the whole property of the accused was seized and held;\r\nthis was peculiarly oppressive and the council represented that it\r\nviolated the fueros granted by King Jaime and King Alfonso, but\r\nFerdinand replied, September 11th, that he was resolved that nothing\r\nbelonging to him should be lost but should be rigidly collected, while\r\nwhat belonged to others should not be taken. Another letter of September\r\n6th to the Governor Luis Cabanilles refers to an arrangement of a kind\r\nthat became frequent, under which the Conversos agreed to pay a certain\r\nsum as a composition for the confiscations of those who might be proved\r\nto be heretics.[619]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CRISTOBAL GUALBES_]\r\n\r\nAt length, on October 9th, Sixtus replied to Ferdinand in a manner to\r\nshow that he was open to accommodation. The new rules, he said, had been\r\ndrawn up with the advice of the cardinals deputed for the purpose; they\r\nhad scattered in fear of the impending pestilence but, when they should\r\nreturn to Rome, he would charge them to consider maturely whether the\r\nbull should be amended; meanwhile he suspended it in so far as it\r\ncontravened the common law, only charging the inquisitors to observe\r\nstrictly the rules of the common law--the \"common law\" here being an\r\nelastic expression, certain to be construed as the traditional\r\ninquisitorial system.[620] Thus the unfortunate Conversos of Aragon, as\r\nwe shall see hereafter were those of Castile, were merely used as pawns\r\nin the pitiless game of king and pope over their despoilment and the\r\nmerciful prescriptions of the bull of April 18th were only of service in\r\nshowing that, in his subsequent policy, Sixtus sinned against light and\r\nknowledge. What negotiations followed, the documents at hand fail to\r\nreveal, but an understanding was inevitable as soon as the two powers\r\ncould agree upon a division of the spoil. It required a twelvemonth to\r\neffect this and in the settlement Ferdinand secured more than he had at\r\nfirst demanded. It was no longer a question of commissioning a fraile to\r\nappoint inquisitors at his pleasure, but of including in the\r\norganization of the Castilian Inquisition the whole of the Spanish\r\ndominions. On October 17, 1483, the agreement was ratified by a bull\r\nappointing Torquemada as inquisitor of Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia,\r\nwith power to appoint subordinates. In this, with characteristic\r\nshamelessness, Sixtus declares that he is only discharging his duty as\r\npope, while his tender care for the reputation of the Dominicans is\r\nmanifested by his omitting to prescribe that the local inquisitors\r\nshould be members of that Order, the only qualification required being\r\nthat they should be masters in theology.[621]\r\n\r\nDuring the interval, prior to this extension of Torquemada's\r\njurisdiction, there was an incident showing that Sixtus had yielded the\r\nappointment of inquisitors, while endeavoring to retain the power of\r\ndismissing them. Cristóbal Gualbes, who was acting in Valencia to the\r\nentire satisfaction of Ferdinand, became involved in a bitter quarrel\r\nwith the Archdeacon Mercader for whom, as we have seen, Cardinal Borgia\r\nhad obtained a papal brief, virtually constituting him an indispensable\r\nmember of the tribunal--a power which he doubtless used speculatively to\r\nthe profit of Borgia and himself. It is to the interference of Gualbes\r\nwith these worthies that we may reasonably attribute the action of\r\nSixtus, who wrote, May 25, 1483, to Ferdinand and Isabella that the\r\nmisdeeds of Gualbes merited heavy punishment, but he contented himself\r\nwith removing him and asked them to fill his place with some fitting\r\nperson on whom he in advance conferred the necessary powers. He\r\nevidently felt doubtful as to their acquiescence, for he wrote on the\r\nsame day to Iñigo Archbishop of Seville, asking him to use his influence\r\nto induce the sovereigns to concur in this.[622] Ferdinand was not\r\ninclined to abandon Gualbes for, in a letter of August 8th, he orders\r\nthe Maestre Racional of Valencia to pay to \"lo devot religios maestre\r\nGualbes\" forty libras to defray his expenses in coming to the king at\r\nCórdova and in order that he might without delay return to work.[623] In\r\nthe final settlement however Gualbes was sacrificed, for when\r\nTorquemada was made Inquisitor-general of Aragon, Sixtus expressly\r\nforbade him from appointing that son of iniquity Cristóbal Gualbes who,\r\nfor his demerits, had been interdicted from serving as inquisitor.[624]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf Ferdinand imagined that he had overcome the resistance of his\r\nsubjects by placing them under the Castilian Inquisition with Torquemada\r\nat its head, he showed less than his usual sagacity. They had been\r\nrestive under the revived institution conducted by their own people and\r\nthe intense particularism of the Aragonese could not fail to arouse\r\nstill stronger opposition to the prospect of subjection to the\r\ndomination of a foreigner such as Torquemada, whose sinister reputation\r\nfor pitiless zeal gave assurance that the work would be conducted with\r\ngreater energy than ever.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VALENCIA_]\r\n\r\nIn Castile the introduction of the Inquisition had been done by the\r\narbitrary power of the crown; in Aragon the consent of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people was felt to be necessary for the change\r\nfrom the old to the new and a meeting of the Córtes was convoked at\r\nTarazona for January 15, 1484. Ferdinand and Isabella arrived there on\r\nthe 19th and remained until May, when the opening of the campaign\r\nagainst Granada required their presence elsewhere. Torquemada was there\r\nready to establish the tribunals; what negotiations were requisite we do\r\nnot know, though we hear of his consulting with persons of influence,\r\nand an agreement was reached on April 14th. It was not until May 7th,\r\nhowever, that Ferdinand issued from Tarazona a cédula addressed to all\r\nthe officials throughout his dominions, informing them that with his\r\nassent the pope had established the Inquisition to repress the Judaic\r\nand Mahometan heresies and ordering that the inquisitors and their\r\nministers should be honored and assisted everywhere under pain of the\r\nroyal wrath, of deprivation of office and of ten thousand florins.[625]\r\n\r\nUnder the plenary powers of Torquemada's commission, steps were taken to\r\nreorganize the Inquisition and adapt it to the active discharge of its\r\nduties. Tribunals were to be established permanently in Valencia,\r\nSaragossa and Barcelona with new men to conduct them. Gualbes was\r\ndisposed of by the enmity of Sixtus IV. Orts still figures in an order\r\nfor the payment of salaries, April 24, 1484, and, on May 10th,\r\nFerdinand, writing from Tarazona, says that he is there and will be sent\r\nto Saragossa, but he never appeared at the latter place, though he was\r\nnot formally removed from office until February 8, 1486, by Innocent\r\nVIII, when he was styled Inquisitor of Valencia and Lérida.[626]\r\n\r\n\r\nVALENCIA.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1484 Torquemada appointed, for Valencia, Fray Juan de\r\nEpila and Martin Iñigo, but the popular resistance and effervescence\r\nwere such that their operations were greatly delayed. The jurats, or\r\nlocal authorities, prevented the opening of their tribunal and, by the\r\nadvice of Miguel Dalman, royal advocate fiscal, presented an appeal to\r\nthe Córtes of the kingdom, imploring their intervention. The Córtes had\r\nassembled and all four _brazos_ or Estates united in remonstrances\r\nagainst the threatened violation of the fueros and privileges of the\r\nland and threw every impediment in the way of the inquisitors. All this\r\nwe learn from a series of letters despatched, July 27th, by Ferdinand to\r\nthe various officials, from the governor down, in which he gives free\r\nvent to his wrath and indignation, declaring his will to be\r\nunchangeable, threatening with punishment and dismissal all who resist\r\nit and pronouncing as frivolous the argument that the Inquisition was an\r\ninvasion of the privileges of the land. At the same time he wrote to the\r\ninquisitors informing them of his proposed measures, instructing them to\r\nperform their duties without fear and cautioning them to observe the\r\nfueros and privileges and to show clemency and mercy, in so far as they\r\ncould with a good conscience, to those who confessed their errors and\r\napplied for reconciliation.[627]\r\n\r\nEnergetic and determined as was the tone of these letters they produced\r\nno effect upon the obstinate Valencians. The Córtes and the city joined\r\nin sending a deputation to the king to remonstrate against the proposed\r\nviolation of their rights. The Maestre Racional stood by and did nothing\r\nto remove the dead-lock. Even the Royal Council of Valencia prevented\r\nthe inquisitors from opening their tribunal, on the ground that they\r\nwere foreigners while, by the fueros, none but natives could exercise\r\nofficial functions. All this produced another explosion of royal anger\r\nunder date of August 31st. Ferdinand roundly scolded his officials and\r\nthreatened punishment proportioned to the gravity of the offence; the\r\nreasons alleged by the envoys and the council were brushed aside as\r\nuntenable; he ordered the governor to set the inquisitors at work,\r\nwithout caring what the Córtes might do or what the people might say,\r\nand he exhorted the inquisitors to lose no time in performing their\r\nduties.[628] The struggle continued but at length opposition was broken\r\ndown and, on November 7, 1484, the inquisitors were able formally to\r\nassume their functions by preaching their _sermon de la fe_ and\r\npublishing their edicts. Although they were thus in shape to carry on\r\nthe business of the tribunal, the usual solemnities were omitted and\r\nthey did not venture to exact, from the secular and ecclesiastical\r\ndignitaries, the customary oaths--all of which Ferdinand subsequently\r\nordered to be performed.[629]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VALENCIA_]\r\n\r\nScarcely had the inquisitors commenced operations when Borgia's\r\nrepresentative, the Archdeacon Mateo Mercader, was the cause of fresh\r\ntrouble. Discord arose between him and Juan de Epila which threatened to\r\nhave even more serious results than his quarrels with Gualbes, which had\r\ncompromised the attempt to revive the old Inquisition. Ferdinand's\r\npatience was exhausted and so serious did he consider the situation that\r\nhe despatched his secretary, Antonio Salavert, to Valencia armed with\r\nperemptory orders to Mercader and the governor. The former was required\r\nto make over his episcopal functions to Martí Trigo, another\r\nvicar-general, to surrender the bull of December 4, 1481, delegating to\r\nhim inquisitorial powers, and no longer to meddle in any way with the\r\nHoly Office. In case of disobedience, the governor was instructed,\r\nwithout a moment's delay, to order him under pain of five thousand\r\nflorins, to depart within twenty-four hours for the royal court and to\r\nbe beyond the frontier of Valencia within six days; if he failed in this\r\nall his temporalities were to be seized to defray the fine and further\r\ncontumacy was to be met by banishing him from the kingdom as a\r\ndisobedient rebel. The inquisitors were also told no longer to summon\r\nhim to their deliberations and not to allow him to take part in their\r\naction.[630] All this was in flagrant violation of the fueros of the\r\nland and independence of the Church and shows what latitude Ferdinand\r\nallowed himself when the Inquisition was concerned. It was successful\r\nhowever and we hear no more of Mercader, though it was not until\r\nFebruary 8, 1486, that the curia assented to this arbitrary illegality\r\nby withdrawing his commission along with those of the old\r\ninquisitors.[631]\r\n\r\nStill, Valencia was not disposed to allow to the Inquisition the\r\nuntrammelled exercise of its powers or to render to it the assistance\r\nrequired of all the faithful. The nobles continued for some months to\r\noffer resistance and when this was nominally broken down it continued in\r\na passive form. To meet it, Ferdinand, in a letter of August 17, 1485,\r\nordered Mossen Joan Carrasquier, alguazil of the Inquisition, at the\r\nsimple bidding of the inquisitors, to arrest and imprison any one, no\r\nmatter how high in station. For this he was not to ask the concurrence\r\nof any secular authority, for the whole royal power was committed to him\r\nand all officials, under pain of two thousand gold florins, and other\r\narbitrary punishment, were required to lend him active assistance. Even\r\nthis infraction of the royal oath to respect the liberties of the\r\nsubject did not suffice, for another letter of January 23, 1486, states\r\nthat the nobles continued to give refuge in their lands to fugitives\r\nfrom the Inquisition, even to those condemned and burnt in effigy,\r\nwherefore they were summoned, under their allegiance and a penalty of\r\ntwenty thousand gold florins, to surrender to the alguazil all whom he\r\nmight designate and to aid him in seizing them. About the same time\r\nFerdinand placed the royal palace of Valencia at the service of the\r\nInquisition and ordered to be built in it the necessary prisons. His own\r\nofficials apparently had by this time been taught obedience for in\r\nMarch, 1487, he writes to the governor warmly praising their zeal.[632]\r\nTo stimulate this, on July 28, 1487, he issued a safe-conduct, taking\r\nunder the royal protection all the officials of the Inquisition, their\r\nfamilies and goods; all royal officials, from the highest to the lowest,\r\nwere required, under pain of five thousand florins and the king's wrath,\r\nto assist them and to arrest whomsoever they might designate.[633]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ARAGON_]\r\n\r\nStill, there were occasional ebullitions of resistance which were met\r\nwith prompt and effective measures. In 1488 the Lieutenant-general of\r\nthe kingdom ventured to remove by force, from the inquisitorial prison,\r\na certain Domingo de Santa Cruz, condemned for heresy, and was at once\r\nsummoned by Torquemada to answer for his temerity. Ferdinand at the same\r\ntime wrote to him severely to come without delay and, that the kingdom\r\nmight not be without a governor, sent him a commission in blank to fill\r\nin with the name of a deputy to act during his absence or until the king\r\nshould otherwise provide; moreover, all who had assisted in the removal\r\nof the prisoner were to be forthwith arrested by the inquisitors.[634]\r\nSo, when in 1497 the notaries of Valencia claimed that the notaries of\r\nthe Holy Office had no power to certify documents concerning the sales\r\nof confiscated property and other similar business and summoned them\r\nbefore the secular authorities, Ferdinand threatened them with severe\r\npunishment, besides the prosecution by the inquisition to which they\r\nwere liable for impeding it, for it was not subject to any of the laws\r\nor privileges of the land. He also wrote to the Duke of Segorbe, his\r\nlieutenant-general, to support the Inquisition; the fiscal of the\r\nSuprema presented a _clamosa_ claiming that those guilty of this action\r\nwere excommunicate and liable to the penalties for fautorship of heresy,\r\nand the inquisitor-general forwarded this to them with a summons to\r\nappear within fifteen days and defend themselves.[635] The Inquisition\r\nwas so sacred that a mere attempt to decide at law a question of\r\nbusiness was a crime involving heavy penalties. Ferdinand's sharp\r\nrebuke, in 1499, when a case of confiscation, involving peculiar\r\nhardship, provoked the royal officials and local magistrates to meet and\r\ndraw up a protest in terms unflattering to the tribunal has already been\r\nreferred to (p. 189). It was probably one of the results of this that,\r\non June 28, 1500, the inquisitors summoned all the officials and the\r\nDiputados before them and, when all were assembled, read to them the\r\napostolic letters and those of the king respecting the tribunal and its\r\nfees and required all present to take the oath of obedience, which was\r\nduly acceded to without objections.[636] The unintermitting pressure of\r\nthe throne was thus finally effective and, in spite of its fueros, the\r\nlittle kingdom was brought under the yoke.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal had been active and efficient. Already, in June, 1488, a\r\nlist of those reconciled under the Edicts of Grace amounted to 983 and,\r\namong these, no less than a hundred women are described as the wives or\r\ndaughters of men who had been burnt. Those included in this enumeration\r\nwere given assurance that their property would not be subject to\r\nconfiscation--unless it had already been sequestrated--and that they\r\ncould effect sales and make good titles. Apparently inquisitorial zeal\r\ndisregarded this assurance for these penitents applied for and obtained\r\nits confirmation, May 30, 1491.[637] Of course they had been subjected\r\nto heavy fines under the guise of pecuniary penance and we can readily\r\nimagine how large was the sum thus contributed to the coffers of the\r\nInquisition, to which as yet these fines enured.\r\n\r\n\r\nARAGON.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OPPOSITION IN SARAGOSSA_]\r\n\r\nThe parent state of Aragon proper seemed at first sight to present an\r\neven more arduous problem than Valencia. The people were proud of their\r\nancient liberty and resolute in its maintenance, through institutions\r\nsedulously organized for that purpose. The Conversos were numerous,\r\nwealthy and powerful, occupying many of the higher offices and\r\nintermarried with the noblest houses and, in the fate of their brethren\r\nof Castile, they had ample warning of what was in store for them. In the\r\nrevival of the old Inquisition, Valencia was the scene of action and we\r\nhear little of Gualbes and Orts beyond its boundaries. The acceptance,\r\nhowever, by the Córtes of Tarazona, in the Spring of 1484, of\r\nTorquemada's jurisdiction, of course included Aragon; he lost no time in\r\norganizing a tribunal in Saragossa, by the appointment, May 4th, as\r\ninquisitors of Fray Gaspar Juglar and of Maestre Pedro Arbués, a canon\r\nof the cathedral, with the necessary subordinates and, by May 11th, the\r\nappointments for a full court were completed, as we learn by an order\r\nfor the payment of the salaries.[638] The expense was large but it was\r\nalready provided for; Torquemada must himself have employed his leisure\r\nin acting as inquisitor for, on May 10th, an auto de fe was held in the\r\ncathedral in which four persons were penanced and subjected to\r\nconfiscation.[639] Gaspar Juglar in this appointment obtained his reward\r\nfor the services he had rendered as a nominator of inquisitors, but he\r\ndid not long enjoy it; he disappears almost immediately, poisoned, as it\r\nwas said, by the Conversos in some _rosquillas_ or sweet cakes.[640] No\r\ntime was lost in getting to work. Ferdinand had written from Tarazona,\r\nMay 10th, that the Edict of Grace which had been resolved upon was not\r\nto be published, but that proceedings should go on as if it had been\r\nproclaimed and had expired, thus depriving the Conversos of the\r\nopportunity of coming forward for confessing, and explaining the absence\r\nat Saragossa of the long lists of penitents that we find elsewhere.[641]\r\nThus, although some time must have been required for the members of the\r\ntribunal to assemble, by June 3d it was ready for another auto, held in\r\nthe courtyard of the archiepiscopal palace. This time it was not\r\nbloodless, for two men were executed and a woman was burnt in\r\neffigy.[642]\r\n\r\nNo more autos were held in Saragossa for eighteen months. Thus far the\r\npeople had been passive; they had accepted the action of the Córtes of\r\nTarazona, apparently under the impression that the new Inquisition would\r\nbe as inert as the old had so long been, but, as they awoke to the\r\nreality, an opposition arose which called a halt and Arbués never\r\ncelebrated another auto. Not only the Conversos but many of the Old\r\nChristians denounced the Inquisition as contrary to the liberties of the\r\nland. The chief objections urged against it were the secrecy of\r\nprocedure and the confiscation of estates and, as these were the veriest\r\ncommonplaces of inquisitorial business, it shows how completely the old\r\ninstitution had been dormant. So many Conversos were lawyers and judges\r\nand high officials that they had abundant opportunity to impede the\r\naction of the tribunal by obtaining injunctions and decisions of the\r\ncourts as to confiscations, which they regarded as the most assailable\r\npoint, believing that if these could be stopped the whole business would\r\nperish of inanition.[643]\r\n\r\nTo overcome this resistance, resort was had to the rule compelling all\r\nwho held office to take the oath of obedience to the Inquisition. On\r\nSeptember 19th, the royal and local officials were assembled and\r\nsolemnly sworn to maintain inviolably the holy Roman Catholic faith, to\r\nemploy all their energies against every one of whatever rank, who was a\r\nheretic or suspect of heresy or a fautor of heresy, to denounce any one\r\nwhom they might know to be guilty and to appoint to office no one\r\nsuspect in the faith or incapacitated by law. A few days later the same\r\noath was taken by the Governor of Aragon, Juan Francisco de Heredia and\r\nhis assessor, Francisco de Santa Fe, son of that Geronimo de Santa Fe\r\nthe convert, who had stimulated the popular abhorrence of Judaism.\r\nOther nobles were subsequently required to take the oath, and it was\r\ngradually administered to all the different Estates. Then, in November,\r\nfollowed Torquemada's assembly of inquisitors at Seville, whose\r\ninstructions were duly transmitted to Aragon for observance, although\r\nAragon had not been represented in the conference. Thus far the tribunal\r\nseems to have had no definite quarters, but it was now settled in some\r\nhouses between the cathedral and the archiepiscopal palace, convenient\r\nto the ecclesiastical gaol.[644]\r\n\r\nAgitation grew stronger and those who deemed themselves in danger began\r\nto seek safety in flight, whereupon Ferdinand, on November 4th, issued\r\norders to the authorities of the three kingdoms to adopt whatever means\r\nmight be necessary to prevent the departure of all who were not firm in\r\nthe faith. The effort proved ineffective, as it was decided to be in\r\nviolation of the fueros, but the Inquisition was superior to the fueros\r\nand Ferdinand instructed the inquisitors to issue an edict forbidding\r\nany one to leave the kingdom without their license, under pain of being\r\nheld as a relapsed heretic in case of return, and this scandalous\r\nstretch of arbitrary power he sarcastically said that he would enforce\r\nso that the object might be attained without infringing on the liberties\r\nof the kingdom.[645]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RESISTANCE IN TERUEL_]\r\n\r\nThe rich Conversos offered large amounts to the sovereigns if they would\r\nforego the confiscations, but the proposition was rejected. A heavy sum\r\nwas subscribed to propitiate the curia, but the arrangement by which the\r\nland was subjected to Torquemada was too recent to be changed. The\r\nlieutenant of the Justicia of Aragon, Tristan de la Porta, was urged to\r\nprohibit the Inquisition altogether, but in vain. Then the Four Estates\r\nof the realm were called together to deliberate on a subject which\r\ninvolved the liberties of the whole land. To forestall their action\r\nFerdinand, on December 10th, addressed a circular letter to the deputies\r\nand to the leading nobles, entreating them affectionately to favor and\r\naid the inquisitors of Saragossa and Teruel, but this had no influence\r\nand a solemn embassy was sent to remonstrate with him. To their\r\nrepresentations he answered, disposing of their arguments by assuming\r\npractically that he was only the agent of the Church in enforcing the\r\nwell-known principles of the canons. The essence of his answer is\r\nembodied in responding to their demand that the Inquisition be carried\r\non as in times past, for in any other way it violated the liberties of\r\nthe kingdom. \"There is no intention\" he said \"of infringing on the\r\nfueros but rather of enforcing their observance. It is not to be\r\nimagined that vassals so Catholic as those of Aragon would have\r\ndemanded, or that kings so Catholic would have granted, fueros and\r\nliberties adverse to the faith and favorable to heresy. If the old\r\ninquisitors had acted conscientiously in accordance with the canons\r\nthere would have been no cause for bringing in the new ones, but they\r\nwere without conscience and corrupted with bribes. If there are so few\r\nheretics as is now asserted, there should not be such dread of the\r\nInquisition. It is not to be impeded in sequestrating and confiscating\r\nand other necessary acts, for be assured that no cause or interest,\r\nhowever great, shall be allowed to interfere with its proceeding in\r\nfuture as it is now doing.\"[646]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there had been, at Teruel, a more open resistance to the\r\nInquisition, in which the inflexible purpose of the monarch to enforce\r\nobedience at any cost was abundantly demonstrated. Simultaneously with\r\nthe organization of the Saragossa tribunal, Fray Juan Colivera and\r\nMossen Martin Navarro were sent to Teruel with their subordinates to\r\nestablish one there. Teruel was a fortified city of some importance,\r\nnear the Castilian border, the capital of its district, although it was\r\nnot elevated into a separate bishopric until 1577. When the reverend\r\nfathers appeared before the gates, the magistrates refused them entrance\r\nand they prudently retired to Cella, a village about four leagues\r\ndistant, whence they fulminated an edict excommunicating the magistrates\r\nand casting an interdict on the town. From the venal papal court Teruel\r\nhad no difficulty in procuring letters in virtue of which the dean,\r\nFrancisco Savistan, and Martin de San Juan, rector of Villaquemada,\r\nabsolved the excommunicates and removed the interdict, nor is it likely\r\nthat any success attended Ferdinand's order to his son, the Archbishop\r\nof Saragossa, to send to his official at Teruel secret instructions to\r\nseize the two priests and hold them in chains. The town sent a\r\nsupplication to him by Juan de la Mata and Micer Jaime Mora, but he only\r\nordered them to send home a peremptory command to submit, under pain of\r\nsuch punishment as should serve as a perpetual example. This he also\r\ncommunicated to the Governor of Aragon, Juan Fernández de Heredia, with\r\ninstructions to take it to Teruel and read it to the magistrates, when,\r\nif they did not yield, a formal summons to appear before him was to be\r\nread to each one individually--all of which was doubtless performed\r\nwithout effect. Ferdinand had also ordered the envoys not to leave the\r\ncourt, but they fled secretly and his joy was extreme when, six months\r\nlater, Juan de la Mata was captured by Juan Garcés de Marzilla.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RESISTANCE IN TERUEL_]\r\n\r\nThe next step of the Inquisition was a decree, October 2, 1484,\r\nconfiscating to the crown all the offices in Teruel and pronouncing the\r\nincumbents incapable of holding any office of honor or profit--a decree\r\nwhich Ferdinand proceeded to execute by stopping their salaries. It was\r\nin vain that the Diputados of Aragon interceded with him; he replied\r\ncurtly that the people of Teruel had nothing to complain of and were\r\nguilty of madness and outrage. Then the inquisitors took final action,\r\nwhich was strictly within their competence, by issuing a letter invoking\r\nthe aid of the secular arm and summoning the king to enable them to\r\nseize the magistrates and confiscate their property. To this he\r\nresponded, February 5, 1485, with an _Executoria invocationis brachii\r\nsæcularis_, addressed to all the officials of Aragon, requiring them and\r\nthe nobles to assemble all the horse and foot that they could raise and\r\nput them at the service of the inquisitors, under a captain whom he\r\nwould send to take command. Under pain of the royal wrath, deprivation\r\nof office, a fine of twenty thousand gold florins and discretional\r\npenalties, they were ordered to seize all the inhabitants of Teruel and\r\ntheir property and deliver them to the inquisitors to be punished for\r\ntheir enormous crimes in such wise as should serve for a lasting\r\nexample. The people of Cella, also, were ordered to deliver their castle\r\nto the inquisitors to serve as a prison and to make all repairs\r\nnecessary for that purpose. Apparently the response of Aragon to this\r\nsummons was unsatisfactory for Ferdinand, in defiance of the fuero which\r\nforbade the introduction of foreign troops into the kingdom, took the\r\nextreme step of calling upon the nobles of Cuenca and other Castilian\r\ndistricts contiguous to the border, to raise their men and join in the\r\nholy war, while the receiver of confiscations was ordered to sell enough\r\nproperty to meet the expenses. Whether this formidable array was raised\r\nor not, the documents do not inform us, nor of the circumstances under\r\nwhich Teruel submitted, but it had braved the royal will as long as it\r\ndared and it could not hold out against the forces of two kingdoms. By\r\nApril 15th Ferdinand was in position to appoint Juan Garcés de Marzilla,\r\nthe captor of Juan de la Mata, as _assistente_ or governor of Teruel,\r\nwith absolute dictatorial powers, and the spirit in which he exercised\r\nthem may be gathered from his declaration that he did not intend to\r\nallow fueros or privileges to stand in the way. The lot of the\r\ninhabitants was hard. Ferdinand ordered Marzilla to banish all whom the\r\ninquisitors might designate, thus placing the whole population at their\r\nmercy, and their rule must have been exasperating, for, in January,\r\n1486, Ferdinand reproaches Marzilla because his nephew, who had aided in\r\nthe capture of la Mata, had recently attempted to slay the alguazil of\r\nthe Inquisition. Presumably the inquisitorial coffers were filled with\r\nthe fines and confiscations which could be inflicted at discretion on\r\nthe citizens for impeding the Inquisition. During the long struggle\r\nTeruel had been at the disadvantage that the surrounding country\r\nsupported the inquisitors, won over through an astute device by which\r\nthe inquisitors, while at Cella, had guaranteed, on the payment of\r\ncertain sums, the remission of all debts and the release of all censos\r\nor bonds and groundrents, which might be due to heretics who should be\r\nconvicted and subjected to confiscation in Teruel. All debtors were thus\r\neager for the success of the inquisitors and for the punishment of\r\nheresy among the money-lending Conversos of the town.[647]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in Saragossa, the Conversos were growing desperate. All\r\npeaceful means of averting the fate that hung over them had failed and\r\nevents at Teruel demonstrated the futility of resistance. The bolder\r\nspirits began to whisper that the only resource left was to kill an\r\ninquisitor or two, when the warning would deter others from incurring\r\nthe hazard. They knew that secret informations were on foot gathering\r\nfrom all sources testimony against them all. Inquisitor Arbués was\r\nalmost openly said to be ready to pay for satisfactory evidence, and the\r\nlife and fortune of every man was at the mercy of the evil-minded.[648]\r\nSancho de Paternoy, the Maestre Racional of Aragon, when on trial,\r\nadmitted to prejudice against Juan de Anchias, secretary of the\r\ntribunal, because he had enquired of a Jewish tailor whether Paternoy\r\nhad a seat in the synagogue.[649] Suspense was becoming insupportable;\r\nthe project of assassination gradually took shape and, when the friends\r\nof the Conversos at the royal court were consulted, including\r\nFerdinand's treasurer Gabriel Sánchez, they approved of it and wrote\r\nthat if an inquisitor was murdered it would put an end to the\r\nInquisition.[650]\r\n\r\nAt first the intention was to make way not only with Pedro Arbués but\r\nwith the assessor, Martin de la Raga, and with Micer Pedro Francés, and\r\na plot was laid to drown the assessor while he was walking by the Ebro,\r\nbut he chanced to be accompanied by two gentlemen and it was\r\nabandoned.[651] The whole attention of the conspirators was then\r\nconcentrated on Arbués. Maestre Epila, as he was commonly called, was\r\nnot a man of any special note, though his selection by Torquemada\r\nindicates that he was reputed to possess the qualities necessary to curb\r\nthe recalcitrant Aragonese, and we are told that he was an eloquent\r\npreacher. He possessed the gift of prophecy, if we may believe the story\r\nthat he foretold to his colleague Martin García that he would reach the\r\nepiscopate, for García, in 1512, became Bishop of Barcelona, but such\r\nforesight is not necessary to explain his reluctance to accept the\r\ninquisitorship, for, although this was always a promising avenue to\r\npromotion, the post was evidently to be an arduous one.[652] His\r\nhesitation was overcome and we have seen how energetically he commenced\r\nhis new career, yet the interruptions which supervened had prevented him\r\nfrom accomplishing much and he fell a victim rather to fear than to\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ASSASSINATION OF ARBUES_]\r\n\r\nThe conspirators were evidently irresolute, for the plot was long in\r\nhatching, but the secret was wonderfully well kept, considering that the\r\ncorrespondence respecting it was extensive. Rumors however were not\r\nlacking and, as early as January 29, 1485, Ferdinand wrote to the\r\nGovernor of Aragon that a conspiracy was on foot and that a large sum\r\nwas being raised to embarrass the Inquisition in every way, yet at the\r\nsame time he thanked the jurats for their zeal in aiding the\r\ninquisitors.[653] If suspicion was then aroused, it slumbered again and\r\nfor six months meetings were held without being discovered. It was\r\ndetermined to raise fund for hiring assassins and three treasurers were\r\nappointed. Juan de Esperandeu, a currier, known as a desperate man,\r\nwhose father had been arrested, undertook to find the bravos and hired\r\nJuan de la Badía for the purpose. In April or May, 1485, an attempt was\r\nmade on the house where Arbués lodged, but the men were frightened off\r\nand the matter was postponed for several months. At length, on the night\r\nof September 15th, Esperandeu went to the house of la Badía and wakened\r\nhim; together they returned to Esperandeu's, where they found the\r\nlatter's servant Vidau Durango, a Frenchman, with Mateo Ram, one of the\r\nleaders of the plot, his squire Tristanico Leonis and three others who\r\nwere masked and who remained unknown. They all went to the cathedral and\r\nentered by the chapter door, which was open on account of the service of\r\nmatins. Arbués was kneeling in prayer between the high altar and the\r\nchoir, where the canons were chanting; he knew that his life was\r\nthreatened, for he wore a coat of mail and a steel cap, while a lance\r\nwhich he carried was leaning against a pillar. La Badía whispered to\r\nDurango \"There he is, give it to him!\" Durango stole up behind and, with\r\na back-stroke, clove his neck between his armor. He rose and staggered\r\ntowards the choir, followed by la Badía, who pierced him through the\r\narm, while Mateo Ram was also said to have thrust him through the body.\r\nHe fell; the assassins hurried away and the canons, alarmed at the\r\nnoise, rushed from the choir and carried him to his house near by, where\r\nsurgeons were summoned who pronounced the wounds to be mortal. He lay\r\nfor twenty-four hours, repeating, we are told, pious ejaculations, and\r\ndied on September 17th, between 1 and 2 A.M. Miracles at once attested\r\nhis sanctity. On the night of the murder the holy bell of Villela tolled\r\nwithout human hands, breaking the bull's pizzle with which the clapper\r\nwas secured. His blood, which stained the flagstones of the cathedral,\r\nafter drying for two weeks, suddenly liquefied, so that crowds came to\r\ndip in it cloths and scapulars and had to be forcibly driven off when he\r\nwas buried on the spot where he fell: when the conspirators were\r\ninterrogated by the inquisitors, their mouths became black and their\r\ntongues were parched so that they were unable to speak until water was\r\ngiven to them. It was popularly believed that when, in their flight,\r\nthey reached the boundaries of the kingdom, they became divinely\r\nbenumbed until seized by their captors. More credible is the miracle,\r\nreported by Juan de Anchias, that their trials led to the discovery of\r\ninnumerable heretics who were duly penanced or burnt.[654] Pecuniarily\r\nthe affair had not been costly; the whole outlay had been only six\r\nhundred florins, of which one hundred was paid to the assassin.[655]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REVULSION OF FEELING_]\r\n\r\nLike the murder of Pierre de Castelnau in Languedoc, this crime turned\r\nthe scale. Its immediate effect was to cause a revulsion of popular\r\nfeeling, which hitherto had been markedly hostile to the Inquisition.\r\nThe news of the assassination spread through the city with marvellous\r\nrapidity and before dawn the streets were filled with excited crowds\r\nshouting \"Burn the Conversos who have slain the inquisitor!\" There was\r\ndanger, in the exaltation of feeling, not only that the Conversos would\r\nbe massacred but that the Judería and Morería would be sacked. By\r\ndaylight the archbishop, Alfonso de Aragon, mounted his horse and\r\ntraversed the streets, calming the mob with promises of speedy justice.\r\nA meeting was at once called of all the principal persons in the city,\r\nwhich resolved itself into a national assembly and empowered all\r\necclesiastical and secular officials to proceed against every one\r\nconcerned with the utmost vigor and without observing the customs and\r\nfueros of the kingdom.[656] For some days the Conversos continued to\r\nflatter themselves that with money they would disarm Ferdinand's wrath;\r\nthey had, they said, the whole court with them and the sympathies of all\r\nthe magnates of the land,[657] but they miscalculated his shrewd resolve\r\nto profit to the utmost by their blunder and the consequent weakness of\r\ntheir friends. The royal anger, indeed, was much dreaded and the\r\nDiputados, a few days later, wrote to the king reporting what had been\r\ndone; the criminals had already scattered in flight; the city had\r\noffered a reward of five hundred ducats; the judges had written to\r\nforeign lands to invoke aid in intercepting the fugitives and both city\r\nand kingdom would willingly undergo all labor and expense necessary to\r\navenge the crime. A proclamation was also issued excommunicating all\r\nhaving knowledge of the conspiracy who should not within a given time\r\ncome forward and reveal what they knew.[658]\r\n\r\nIt was probably in consequence of the murder that Ferdinand and Isabella\r\nsucceeded in obtaining, from Innocent VIII, papal letters of April 3,\r\n1487, ordering all princes and rulers and magistrates to seize and\r\ndeliver to the Inquisition of Spain all fugitives who should be\r\ndesignated to them, thus extending its arms everywhere throughout\r\nChristendom and practically outlawing all refugees; no proof was to be\r\nrequired, simple requisition sufficed, the surrender was to be made\r\nwithin thirty days and safe-conduct assured to the frontier, under pain\r\nof excommunication and the penalties for fautorship of heresy.\r\nFortunately for humanity this atrocious attempt to establish a new\r\ninternational law by papal absolutism was practically ignored.[659]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITION AT WORK_]\r\n\r\nThere was one case however in which its punitive clauses seem to have\r\nbeen invoked. Several of the accomplices in the assassination found\r\nrefuge in Tudela, a frontier city of Navarre and on January 27, 1486,\r\nFerdinand wrote to the magistrates there affectionately requesting that,\r\nif the inquisitors should send for the accused, all aid should be\r\nrendered, seeing that he had given orders to obey such requisitions\r\nthroughout his own kingdoms. This application was unsuccessful and in\r\nMay he repeated it imperiously, threatening war upon them as defenders\r\nof heretics.[660] The condition of the perishing kingdom of Navarre,\r\nunder the youthful Catherine and Jean d'Albret, was not such as to\r\nprotect it from the insults of a sovereign like Ferdinand and the\r\ninquisitors presumed so far as to instruct Don Juan de Ribera, then in\r\ncommand of the frontier, to carry the royal threats into execution. That\r\nprudent officer refused to make war upon a friendly state without the\r\nprotection of an express order bearing the signatures of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, whereupon, on June 30th, the inquisitors complained of him to\r\nthe king. He was in Galicia, suppressing a rising of the Count of Lemos\r\nand reducing the lawless nobles to order and from Viso, July 22d, he\r\nreplied that he would at once have sent the order but that he had\r\nbrought with him all the frontier troops; as soon as his task was\r\naccomplished he would send back forces with orders to Don Juan to make\r\nwar on Tudela in such fashion as to compel it to do what was requisite\r\nfor the service of God.[661] A letter of the same date to Torquemada\r\nstates that the inquisitors have asked for letters of marque and\r\nreprisal against Tudela on account of Luis de Santangel, but this must\r\nbe preceded by a _carta requisitoria_, which he instructs Torquemada to\r\nprepare and send to him when he will execute it.[662] It was not until\r\nthe end of November that the sovereigns returned to Salamanca and it is\r\npresumable that the campaign against Tudela was postponed until the\r\nSpring. Of course the fugitives had long before sought some safer\r\nasylum, but the papal brief of April 3, 1487, could be enforced against\r\nthe magistrates and they endured the humiliation of submitting to the\r\ntribunal of Saragossa. At an auto de fe held March 2, 1488, the alcalde\r\nand eight of the citizens appeared and performed penance.[663]\r\n\r\nFerdinand recognized the opportunity afforded by the assassination of\r\nArbués and was resolved to make the most of it. Prominent among the\r\nmeans for this was the stimulation of the popular veneration of the\r\nmartyr. On September 29, 1486, his solemn exequies were celebrated with\r\nas much solemnity as those of the holiest saint; a splendid tomb was\r\nbuilt to which his remains were translated, December 8, 1487; a statue\r\nwas erected with an inscription by the sovereigns and over it a\r\nbas-relief representing the scene of the murder. During a pestilence, in\r\n1490, the city ordered a silver lamp, fifty ounces in weight, to be\r\nplaced before the tomb and another silver lamp to burn day and\r\nnight.[664] His cult as a saint was not allowed to await the tardy\r\nrecognition of the Holy See.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators miscalculated when they imagined that his murder would\r\ndeter others from taking his place. There was no danger for inquisitors\r\nnow in Aragon and the tribunal of Saragossa was promptly remanned and\r\nenlarged for the abundant harvest that was expected.[665] It was not\r\nlong in getting to work and on December 28, 1485, an auto was celebrated\r\nin which a man and a woman were burnt.[666] The tribunal was removed to\r\nthe royal palace-fortress outside of the walls, known as the Aljafería,\r\nas an evidence that it was under the royal safeguard and Ferdinand\r\nproclaimed that he and his successors took it under their special\r\nprotection.[667] Strict orders were sent to the Estates of the kingdom\r\nand to the local officials to suppress summarily all resistance to the\r\nconfiscations, which were becoming so extensive that the receiver at\r\nSaragossa had his hands full and was empowered to appoint deputies\r\nthroughout the land to attend to the work in their respective\r\ndistricts.[668]\r\n\r\nIn the prevailing temper pursuit was hot after the murderers of Arbués\r\nand the avengers were soon upon their track. There were some\r\nhair-breadth escapes, and much curious detail, for which space fails us\r\nhere, will be found in the _Memoria de diversos Autos_ in the Appendix,\r\nsome of it showing that there were powerful secret influences in favor\r\nof individuals. One party, consisting of the chief contriver of the\r\nplot, Juan de Pedro Sánchez and his wife, Gaspar de Santa Cruz and his\r\nwife, Martin de Santangel, García de Moras, Mossen Pedro Mañas and the\r\ntwo Pedro de Almazan, effected their escape by way of Tudela, for which,\r\nas we have seen, that city was held responsible, and the Lord of\r\nCadreyta, an ancestor of the Dukes of Alburquerque, was penanced for\r\ngiving them shelter and receiving sixty florins in payment.[669]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PUNISHMENT OF THE ASSASSINS_]\r\n\r\nAlthough by decree both secular and ecclesiastical courts were empowered\r\nto punish the guilty, the prosecutions seem to have been left altogether\r\nto the Inquisition and it had the satisfaction of burning the effigies\r\nof the fugitives. Many, however, paid the penalty in their persons.\r\nVidau Durango was soon caught at Lérida, when he made no difficulty in\r\nrevealing the details of the plot and the names of the accomplices. The\r\nwork of retribution followed and was continued for years. In the auto of\r\nJune 30, 1486, Juan de Pedro Sánchez was burnt in effigy; Vidau Durango\r\nwas treated mercifully, doubtless in consideration of his\r\ncommunicativeness; his hands were cut off and nailed to the door of the\r\nDiputacion, or House of Diputados, and it was not until he was dead that\r\nhe was dragged to the market-place when he was beheaded and quartered\r\nand the fragments were suspended in the streets. The punishment of Juan\r\nde Esperandeu was more harsh; he was dragged while living to the portal\r\nof the cathedral when his hands were cut off; he was then dragged to the\r\nmarket-place, beheaded and quartered, as in the case of Durango. On\r\nJuly 28th Caspar de Santa Cruz and Martin de Santangel were burnt in\r\neffigy and Pedro de Exea, who had contributed to the fund, was burnt\r\nalive. On October 21st, Maria de la Badía was burnt as an accessory. On\r\nDecember 15th an auto was hastily arranged; Francisco de Santa Fe,\r\nassessor of the Governor of Aragon and son of the great Converso\r\nJeronimo de Santa Fe, was fatally compromised in the conspiracy;\r\nhopeless of escape he threw himself from the battlement of the tower in\r\nwhich he was confined and was dashed to pieces and the same day his\r\nremains were burnt and his bones, enclosed in a box, were cast into the\r\nTagus as though it was feared that they would be venerated as those of a\r\nmartyr. Juan de la Badía eluded his tormentors in even more desperate\r\nfashion. An auto was arranged for January 21, 1487, in which he was to\r\nsuffer; in his cell the day before he broke in pieces a glass lamp and\r\nswallowed the fragments, which speedily brought the death he craved; the\r\nnext day his corpse was dragged and quartered and the hands were cut off\r\nand on the same occasion there were burnt in effigy as accomplices Pedro\r\nde Almazan the elder, Anton Pérez and Pedro de Vera. On March 15th Mateo\r\nRam, who superintended the murder, had his hands cut off and was then\r\nburnt, with Joan Francés, who was suspected of complicity and the\r\neffigies of three accomplices, Juan Ram, Alonso Sánchez and García de\r\nMoras. August 8th, Luis de Santangel, who was one of the chief\r\nconspirators, was beheaded in the market-place, his head was set upon a\r\npole and his body was burnt.[670]\r\n\r\nThus the ghastly tragedy went on for years, as the ramifications of the\r\nconspiracy were explored and all who were remotely connected with it\r\nwere traced. It was not until 1488 that Juan de la Caballería was placed\r\non trial, the wife of Caspar de la Caballería having testified that her\r\nhusband told her that Juan had offered him five hundred florins to kill\r\nthe inquisitor. Juan admitted having learned from Juan de Pedro Sánchez\r\nthat there was a fund for the purpose and that he had mentioned it to\r\nGaspar but concluded that Gaspar had not sufficient resolution for the\r\ndeed; he died in gaol in 1490 and his body was burnt in the auto of July\r\n8, 1491, while Gaspar was penanced in that of September 8, 1492.[671] In\r\nthis latter auto Sancho de Paternoy, Maestre Racional of Aragon, was\r\npenanced with perpetual imprisonment. His trial had been a prolonged\r\none; he had been repeatedly tortured and had confessed privity to the\r\nmurder and had then retracted wholly, saying that he knew nothing about\r\nit and that he had spent the night of the assassination in the palace of\r\nthe archbishop. His guilt was not clear; he had powerful friends,\r\nespecially Gabriel Sánchez, Ferdinand's treasurer, and he was punished\r\non mere suspicion.[672] Any expression of satisfaction at the murder was\r\nan offence to be dearly expiated. Among the crimes for which Pedro\r\nSánchez was burnt, May 2, 1489, this is enumerated and it was one of the\r\nchief accusations brought against Brianda de Bardaxi, but, though she\r\nadmitted it under torture she retracted it afterwards; it could not be\r\nproved against her and she was let off with a fine of a third of her\r\nproperty and temporary imprisonment.[673] The assassination gave the\r\nInquisition ample opportunity to make a profound impression and it made\r\nthe most of its good fortune.[674]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RAVAGES OF THE INQUISITION_]\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition thus had overcome all resistance and Aragon lay at its\r\nmercy. How that mercy was exercised is seen in the multitude of victims\r\nfrom among the principal Converso families which were almost\r\nextinguished by the stake or by confiscation. The names of Caballería,\r\nSánchez, Santangel, Ram and others occur with wearying repetition in the\r\nlists of the autos de fe. Thus of the Santangel, who were descended from\r\nthe convert Rabbi Azarías Ginillo, Martin de Santangel escaped to France\r\nand was burnt in effigy; Luis de Santangel, who had been knighted by\r\nJuan II for services in the war with Catalonia, was beheaded and burnt\r\nas we have seen. His cousin, Luis de Santangel, Ferdinand's financial\r\nsecretary, who advanced to Isabella the 16,000 or 17,000 ducats to\r\nenable Columbus to discover the New World, was penanced July 17, 1491.\r\nHe still continued in the royal service but he must have been condemned\r\nagain for, after his death, about 1500, Ferdinand kindly made over his\r\nconfiscated property to his children, including a thousand ducats of\r\ncomposition for the confiscation of Micer Tarancio. There was yet\r\nanother Luis de Santangel, who married a daughter of Juan Vidal, also a\r\nvictim of the Inquisition, and who finally fled with her to France,\r\nafter which he was burnt in effigy. Juan de Santangel was burnt in 1486.\r\nJuan Tomás de Santangel was penanced, August 12, 1487. A brother of Juan\r\nwas the Zalmedina de Santangel who fled to France and was burnt in\r\neffigy March 17, 1497. Gabriel de Santangel was condemned in 1495.\r\nGisperte and Salvador de Santangel were reconciled at Huesca in 1499.\r\nLeonardo de Santangel was burnt at Huesca, July 8, 1489, and his mother\r\ntwo days afterwards. Violante de Santangel and Simon de Santangel, with\r\nClara his wife, were reconciled at Huesca. Micer Miguel de Santangel of\r\nHuesca was reconciled March 1, 1489.[675] To estimate properly this\r\nterrible list we must bear in mind that \"reconciliation\" involved\r\nconfiscation and disabilities inflicted on descendants which were almost\r\nequivalent to extinguishing a family. In 1513 Folsona, wife of Alonso de\r\nSantangel, petitioned Ferdinand saying that her husband, Alonso de\r\nSantangel, thirty years before, had fled from the Inquisition and his\r\nproperty had been confiscated, leaving her in poverty with four young\r\nchildren; she had withheld eighty libras of his effects and had spent\r\nthem; now her conscience impelled her to confess this and to sue for\r\npardon which the king graciously granted \"with our customary clemency\r\nand compassion.\" One of these four children seems to be an Augustin de\r\nSantangel of Barbastro, son of Alonso, who as late as 1556, obtained\r\nrelief from the disabilities consequent on his father's\r\ncondemnation.[676]\r\n\r\nThere was in Aragon no Converso house more powerful than the descendants\r\nof Alazar Usuf and his brothers who took the name of Sánchez and\r\nfurnished many officials of rank such as treasurer, bayle, dispensero\r\nmayor, etc. Of these, between 1486 and 1503, there were burnt, in person\r\nor in effigy, Juan de Pedro Sánchez, Micer Alonso Sánchez, Angelina\r\nSánchez, Brianda Sánchez, Mossen Anton Sánchez, Micer Juan Sánchez, and,\r\namong the Tamarit, with whom they were allied by marriage, Leonor de\r\nTamarit and her sister Olalía, Valentina de Tamarit and Beatríz de\r\nTamarit. Of the same family there were penanced Aldonza Sánchez, Anton\r\nSánchez, Juan de Juan Sánchez, Luis de Juan Sánchez, Juan Sánchez the\r\njurist, Martin Sánchez, María Sánchez and Pedro Sánchez.[677] It is\r\nunnecessary to multiply examples of what was going on in Spain during\r\nthose dreadful years, for Aragon was exceptional only in so far as the\r\nindustrious notary, Juan de Anchías, kept and compiled the records that\r\nshould attest the indelible stain on descendants. There is something\r\nawful in the hideous coolness with which he summarizes the lists of\r\nvictims too numerous to particularize: \"The Gómez of Huesca are New\r\nChristians and many of them have been abandoned to the secular arm and\r\nmany others have been reconciled\"; \"The Zaportas and Benetes of Monzon\r\n... many of them have been condemned and abandoned to the secular\r\narm.\"[678]\r\n\r\n\r\nCATALONIA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RESISTANCE_]\r\n\r\nCatalonia had of old been even more intractable than her sister kingdoms\r\nand fully as jealous of her ancient rights and liberties. The _Capitols\r\nde Cort_, or fueros granted in the successive Córtes, were ordered to be\r\nsystematically arranged and fairly written out in two volumes, one in\r\nLatin and the other in Limosin; these volumes were to be kept in the\r\nDiputacion, secured by chains but open to the public, so that every\r\ncitizen might know his rights. Whenever the king or his officials\r\nviolated them by edict or act, the Diputados--a standing committee of\r\nthe Córtes--were instructed to oppose by every lawful means the invasion\r\nof their liberties until the obnoxious measure should be withdrawn.[679]\r\n\r\nApparently forewarned as to Ferdinand's designs, Catalonia had\r\nmanifested her independence by refusing to send representatives to the\r\nCórtes of Tarazona in January, 1484, alleging that it was illegal to\r\nsummon them beyond the boundaries of the principality.[680] The Catalans\r\nhad thus escaped assenting to the jurisdiction of Torquemada, but this\r\nin no way hindered Ferdinand from sending, May 11th, to Juan de Medina,\r\nhis receiver of confiscations at Barcelona, a list of salaries similar\r\nto that drawn up at the same time for Saragossa, although the names of\r\nappointees were left in blank.[681] The citizens met this by sending him\r\na consulta affirming their rights and meanwhile prevented the old\r\ninquisitors from manifesting any increase of activity. To this Ferdinand\r\nreplied from Córdova, August 4th, expressing his extreme\r\ndissatisfaction. They need not, he assured them, be alarmed as to their\r\nprivileges and liberties, for the Inquisition will do nothing to violate\r\nthem and will use no cruelty but will treat with all clemency those who\r\nreturn to the faith. Further remonstrance, he adds, will be useless for\r\nit is his unchangeable determination that the Inquisition shall perform\r\nits work and opposition to it will be more offensive to him than any\r\nother disservice.[682]\r\n\r\nThe Catalans were obdurate to both blandishments and threats. Barcelona\r\nclaimed, as a special privilege, derived directly from the Holy See,\r\nthat it had a right to an inquisitor of its own and that it could not be\r\nsubjected to an inquisitor-general. It already had its inquisitor in the\r\nperson of Juan Comte, who apparently gave the people no trouble and\r\nserved as a convenient impediment to the extension of Torquemada's\r\njurisdiction, especially as he held a papal commission. To meet this\r\nobstacle Ferdinand wrote, October 12th, to his ambassador at Rome, that\r\nthe inquisitors were not doing their duty, wherefore he earnestly\r\nrequested that, at the earliest possible moment, further power be\r\ngranted to him and to Isabella and Torquemada to appoint and remove at\r\npleasure officials who should be full inquisitors and not merely\r\ncommissioners, as the franchises of the cities provide that they shall\r\nnot be subjected to commissioners.[683] The Catalan Conversos doubtless\r\nunderstood how to counteract with the curia the king's desires, for nine\r\nmonths later, July 9, 1485, Ferdinand again wrote to his _auditor\r\napostólico_ that the Inquisition in Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia was\r\nmuch impeded by the papal commissions granted to Dominican masters of\r\ntheology and other persons, and that he must at once procure a bull\r\nrevoking all commissions to act as inquisitors, especially those of Fray\r\nJuan Comte of Barcelona and Archdeacon Mercader of Valencia; Torquemada\r\nmust have a fresh appointment for the Aragonese kingdoms and especially\r\nas inquisitor of Barcelona, with faculty to subdelegate his powers.[684]\r\nIt is possible that Cardinal Borgia's interest in his Vicar-general\r\nMercader neutralized the efforts of Ferdinand's agents, for six months\r\npassed away without the request being granted and, in January, 1486, the\r\nking ventured the experiment of sending two appointees of Torquemada,\r\nthe Dominicans Juan Franco and Guillen Casells, with an _Executoria pro\r\nInquisitoribus apud Cataloniam_, addressed to all the officials, who\r\nwere ordered under pain of five thousand gold florins to receive and\r\nconvey them safely, to aid them in their work, to arrest and imprison in\r\nchains whomsoever they might designate and to inflict due punishment on\r\nall whom they might abandon to the secular arm.[685] This energetic\r\nmovement was as fruitless as its predecessors and some weeks later an\r\norder was issued to the inquisitors at Saragossa to reimburse, from the\r\npecuniary penances in their hands, the expenses of the cleric who had\r\nbeen sent to Barcelona and also to pay fifty libras each to Esteban\r\nGago, sent there as alguazil and Jaime Millan as notary, in order to\r\nprovide for their support.[686] At the same time Ferdinand expressed the\r\nhope that the Barcelonese tribunal would soon be in working order, and\r\nin this he was not wholly disappointed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BARCELONA SUBMITS_]\r\n\r\nInnocent VIII yielded at last and, by a brief of February 6, 1486, under\r\npretext that they had been too zealous, he removed all inquisitors\r\nholding papal commissions--in Aragon Juan Colivera, Juan de Epila, Juan\r\nFranco and Guillen Casells, in Valencia Juan Orts and Mateo Mercader and\r\nin Barcelona Juan Comte; he appointed Torquemada as special inquisitor\r\nfor Barcelona, with power of subdelegation and, apparently to prepare\r\nfor expected resistance, he authorized the Bishops of Córdova and Leon\r\nand the Abbot of St. Emelian of Burgos to suppress all opposition,\r\nespecially on the part of Juan Comte, while he expressly set aside the\r\nprivileges of the city.[687] In spite of this formidable missive nearly\r\neighteen months elapsed before Barcelona was reduced to submission, and\r\nTorquemada's final appointee, Alonso de Espina, was able to enter the\r\ncity. When at last he succeeded, July 5, 1487, we are told that the\r\nLieutenant-general of the Principality, the Bishops of Urgel, Tortosa\r\nand Gerona and many gentlemen and citizens sallied forth to greet him,\r\nbut there is no mention made of the Diputados, or the local magistracy,\r\nor the canons joining in the reception, and it was not until July 30th\r\nthat the municipal officials took the oath of obedience to him.[688]\r\n\r\nHe probably still found obstacles in his path, for it was not until\r\nDecember 14th that the first procession of penitents took place,\r\nconsisting only of twenty-one men and twenty-nine women, followed, a\r\nweek later, by another in which the participants were scourged.[689] The\r\nsmallness of these numbers, as the result of five months' work, showed\r\nthat the Edict of Grace had met an ungrateful response and the first\r\npublic auto, celebrated January 25, 1488, furnished only four living\r\nvictims and the effigies of twelve fugitives. As already remarked\r\nelsewhere, the fear spread abroad by the advent of the Inquisition,\r\nafter so long a struggle, caused the greater part of those who had\r\nreason for fear to seek safety in flight, in spite of the edicts\r\nforbidding expatriation. During the whole of the year 1488 the number of\r\nburnings amounted only to seven and in 1489 there were but three. It was\r\ndoubtless owing to the lukewarmness of the local magistracy that, in the\r\nearlier autos, the sufferers were spared the extreme penalty of\r\nconcremation and were mercifully strangled before the pile was\r\nlighted.[690] In fact, a royal cédula of March 15, 1488, ordering\r\nafresh all officials to render aid and support to the Inquisition, under\r\npenalty of two thousand florins, would seem to argue no little slackness\r\non their part.[691]\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of the tribunal of Barcelona was extensive,\r\ncomprehending the dioceses of Barcelona, Tarragona, Vich, Gerona,\r\nLérida, Urgel and Elna; the inquisitors were industrious and visited\r\nmany portions of their territory, for we have record, during the\r\nremainder of the century, of autos de fe held in Tarragona, Gerona,\r\nPerpignan, Balaguer and Lérida, but as late as November 18, 1500,\r\nFerdinand complains that in Rosellon the Inquisition had not yet been\r\nput fairly in operation and that no effort had been made to secure the\r\nconfiscations.[692]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SUPREMACY OF THE INQUISITION_]\r\n\r\nThe imperiousness with which the inquisitors exercised their authority\r\nto break the independent spirit of the Catalans is well illustrated by a\r\ntrifling but significant incident in 1494. The city of Tarragona had\r\nestablished a quarantine against Barcelona on account of pestilence. On\r\nJune 18th the inquisitor, Antonio de Contreras, with all his officials,\r\npresumably fleeing from the pest, presented himself at the gates and\r\ndemanded admittance. The vicar-general of the archbishop, the canons and\r\nthe royal and local officials came to meet him and explained the\r\nsituation, asking him to remain in some convenient place in the\r\nneighborhood for some days. His reply was to give them the delay of\r\nthree Misereres in which to open their gates under pain of major\r\nexcommunication and interdict, whereupon they left him, after\r\ninterjecting an appeal to the Holy See. He recited the Miserere thrice,\r\ncommanded his notary to knock at the gate and then fulminated his\r\ncensures, with an additional order that no notary but his own should\r\nmake record of the affair. He then withdrew to the neighboring Dominican\r\nconvent, whence he sent his excommunication to be affixed to the\r\ntown-gates. While at supper, Ciprian Corte, a scrivener, came and served\r\nhim with a notice of the appeal to Rome and was seized and confined in\r\nthe convent prison. During the night the vicar-general with a crowd of\r\ncitizens surrounded the convent in a fashion so threatening that the\r\nscrivener was released. It was not until July 18th that the inquisitor\r\nentered Tarragona, when he suspended the excommunication and interdict\r\nand took testimony as to the affair, banishing a man who said that Vich\r\nhad similarly refused to break a quarantine for an inquisitor. Finally,\r\non September 5th all the dignitaries, ecclesiastical and secular, with\r\nthe leading citizens, were assembled in the chapel of the chapter, in\r\npresence of the inquisitor and of Don Juan de Lanuza, the\r\nLieutenant-general of Catalonia. There they humbly begged for pardon and\r\nabsolution and offered to undergo any penance that he might inflict; he\r\nmade them swear obedience to him and appointed the following Sunday for\r\nthe penance, when they were all obliged to attend mass as penitents,\r\nwith lighted candles in their hands, thus incurring an indelible stigma\r\non themselves and their posterity.[693]\r\n\r\nMen who wielded their awful and irresponsible power in this arbitrary\r\nfashion were not to be restrained by law or custom and from their\r\ntyranny there was no appeal save to the king, who was resolved that no\r\none but himself should check them. He had already, by a cédula of March\r\n26, 1488, forbidden all secular officials, from the lieutenant-general\r\ndown, from taking cognizance of anything concerning the subordinates and\r\nfamiliars of the Holy Office, under penalty of the royal wrath and a\r\nfine of two thousand florins and when, in 1505, the Diputados of\r\nCatalonia were involved in some trifling quarrel with the inquisitors\r\nand represented to Ferdinand that their jurisdiction was in derogation\r\nof the constitution of the land, he sternly replied that the\r\njurisdiction of the faith and the execution of its sentences pertained\r\nto the Inquisition; that this jurisdiction was supreme over all others\r\nand that there was no fuero or law that could obstruct it.[694] This\r\nfateful declaration became practically engrafted upon Spanish public\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that such irresponsible power should not be abused and\r\nthere speedily commenced a series of complaints from the Catalan\r\nauthorities which, as we shall see hereafter, continued with little\r\nintermission until the revolt of 1640. At the present time, however,\r\nFerdinand showed a disposition to curb the abuses inevitable under the\r\nsystem and, in letters of August 16th and 20th and September 3, 1502, to\r\nthe inquisitors of Barcelona, he enclosed a memorial from the Diputados\r\nof Catalonia, accompanying it with a severe rebuke. The chief source of\r\ncomplaint that the receiver of confiscations bought up claims and\r\nprosecuted them through the irresistible machinery of the tribunal. In\r\na sample instance Francí Ballester made over to the receiver for 100\r\nlibras a debt of 228 due by Juan de Trillo which was then collected\r\nthrough the Inquisition. Ferdinand said that he had frequently forbidden\r\nthis practice and he ordered the inquisitors to excommunicate the\r\nreceiver if he persisted in it. The receiver then contented himself with\r\na smaller profit and proceeded, in the case of the confiscated estate of\r\na certain Mahul, to collect from it debts for a commission of ten per\r\ncent., whereby the creditors with the weakest claims got most of the\r\nmoney. Again Ferdinand prohibited this, September 9th, ordering all\r\nfunds to be paid in to the _tabla_ of Barcelona, for equitable\r\ndistribution among the creditors and all commissions to be\r\nrefunded.[695] At the same time there was no talk of the only effective\r\nway of cutting up these practices by the roots--that of discharging the\r\nknavish receiver. This tenderness for official malfeasance continued\r\nthroughout the career of the Inquisition and prevented any effective\r\nreform.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALEARIC ISLES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE BALEARIC ISLES_]\r\n\r\nMajorca claimed to be a separate and independent kingdom, governed by\r\nits own customs and only united dynastically with Catalonia. In 1439 it\r\ncomplained that its franchises were violated by the queen-regent when\r\nshe summoned citizens to appear before her on the mainland, for they\r\nwere entitled to be tried nowhere but at home, and her husband Alfonso V\r\nadmitted the justice of this and promised its observance for the\r\nfuture.[696] The frequent repetition of this privilege shows how highly\r\nit was prized and it rendered necessary a separate tribunal for the\r\nBalearic Isles. This had long been in operation under the old\r\ninstitution and the inquisitor at this period was Fray Nicolas Merola\r\nwho was as inert as his brethren elsewhere. The records of his office\r\nshow that under him there were no relaxations; that in 1478 there were\r\nfour Judaizers reconciled; in 1480, one; in 1482, two and in 1486, one.\r\nHe was probably stimulated to greater energy by the prospect of\r\nremoval, for in 1487 the number increased to eight.[697]\r\n\r\nIt was not until the following year, 1488, that the new Inquisition was\r\nintroduced, when Fray Merola was replaced by the doctors Pedro Pérez de\r\nMunebrega and Sancho Martin.[698] Their Edict of Grace was so successful\r\nthat three hundred and thirty-eight persons came forward, confessed and\r\nwere reconciled, August 18, 1488, in addition to sixteen reconciled,\r\nAugust 13th, after trial. Evidently the prosperous Converso population\r\nrecognized that the new institution was vastly more efficient than the\r\nold. There must undoubtedly have been some popular effervescence, of\r\nwhich the details have not reached us, for the inquisitors were removed\r\nand replaced by a native, Fray Juan Ramon, but, if the change calmed the\r\nagitation it did not diminish the activity of the tribunal, for the\r\nrecords of the year 1489 show seven autos in which there were ten\r\nreconciliations, forty-four relaxations in effigy, one of bones exhumed\r\nand six in person. A momentary pause followed, for, in 1490, we find\r\nonly the reconciliation of ninety-six penitents, March 26th, under the\r\nEdict of Grace. Then, in 1491, another Edict was published, of which, on\r\nJuly 10th and 30th, a hundred and thirty-four persons availed\r\nthemselves, besides two hundred and ninety of those already reconciled\r\nin 1488 and 1490, who had relapsed and were readmitted as a special\r\nmercy. In addition to these the records of 1491 show numerous autos in\r\nwhich there were fifty-seven reconciliations, eighteen relaxations in\r\neffigy and eighteen in person. As elsewhere, the delay in introducing\r\nthe new Inquisition had given opportunity for flight and for some years\r\nthe chief business of the tribunal was the condemnation of fugitives.\r\nThus, in an auto of May 11, 1493, there were but three relaxations in\r\nperson to forty-seven in effigy and, in one of June 14, 1497, there was\r\nno living victim, the bones of one were burnt and the effigies of\r\nfifty-nine.[699]\r\n\r\nAs usual these proceedings against the dead and absent were productive\r\nof abundant confiscations and the fears of descendants were thoroughly\r\naroused lest some aberration of an ancestor should be discovered which\r\nwould sweep away their fortunes. This gave rise to the expedient of\r\ncompositions, of which we shall see more hereafter, as a sort of\r\ninsurance against confiscation. In the present case a letter from\r\nFerdinand, January 28, 1498, to the inquisitor and the receiver\r\nannounces that these people are coming forward with offers and he orders\r\nthe officials to make just and reasonable bargains with them and report\r\nto him, when he will decide what is most to his advantage. In this and\r\nother ways the operations of the tribunal were beginning to bring in\r\nmore than its expenses, for, February 2, 1499, there is an order given\r\non the receiver Matheo de Morrano to pay to the receiver of Valencia two\r\nhundred gold ducats to cancel some debts that were pressing on the royal\r\nconscience, followed soon after by other orders to pay four hundred and\r\nfifty ducats to the royal treasury and fifty florins to the nunnery of\r\nSanta Clara of Calatayud. The confiscating zeal of the officials was\r\nstimulated, February 21, 1498, by an allowance to Morrano of three\r\nthousand sueldos, in addition to his salary, in reward of his eminent\r\nservices and another, March 2d, of a hundred libras mallorquines to the\r\nnotary Pere Prest. It was not always easy to trace the property which\r\nthe unfortunates naturally sought to conceal and a liberal offer of\r\nfifty per cent. was made to informers who should reveal or discover\r\nit.[700]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DISCONTENT_]\r\n\r\nIt was as difficult to reconcile the Mallorquins as the Catalans to the\r\nnew Inquisition. In 1517 the Suprema was obliged to order the viceroy\r\nnot to maltreat the officials or obstruct them in the performance of\r\ntheir duty, and at the same time, the inquisitors were instructed to\r\nproceed against him if he did not cease to trouble them. Apparently he\r\ndid not heed the warning for, in 1518, the inquisitor was formally\r\ncommanded to prosecute him. What followed we have no means of knowing,\r\nbut apparently the viceroy had full popular sympathy, for soon\r\nafterwards there was a rising, led by the Bishop of Elna, whose parents\r\nhad been condemned by the tribunal. The inquisitor fled and the populace\r\nwas about to burn the building and the records, when the firmness of the\r\nBishop of Majorca, at the risk of his life, suppressed the tumult. It\r\nwas probably this disturbance that called forth, in 1520, an adjuration\r\nfrom the Suprema to the viceroy and the ecclesiastical and secular\r\nauthorities, not to permit the ill-treatment of the inquisitor and other\r\nofficials. It was impossible, however, to preserve the peace and, in\r\n1530, we find the viceroy, his assessor and officials, under\r\nexcommunication as the result of a _competencia_ or conflict of\r\njurisdiction. Even more significant was the imprisonment and trial, in\r\n1534, of the regent or president of the royal high court of justice,\r\nresulting in the imposition, in 1537, of a fine so excessive that the\r\nSuprema ordered its reduction.[701] This was but the beginning and we\r\nshall see hereafter how perpetual were the embroilments of the tribunal\r\nwith both the civil and the ecclesiastical authorities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith more or less resistance the new Inquisition was thus imposed on the\r\nvarious provinces subject to the crown of Aragon. The pretence put\r\nforward to secure its introduction, that it in no way violated the\r\nfueros and liberties of the land, was soon dropped and, as we have seen,\r\nit was boldly pronounced to be superior to all law. For awhile this was\r\nsubmitted to in silence, but the ever-encroaching arrogance of the\r\nofficials, their extension of their jurisdiction over matters\r\nunconnected with the faith and their abuse of their irresponsible\r\nprerogatives aroused opposition which at length found opportunity for\r\nexpression. In 1510 the representatives of Aragon, Catalonia and\r\nValencia were, for the first time, assembled together in the Córtes of\r\nMonzon. They came with effusive enthusiasm, stimulated by the conquest\r\nof Oran and Algiers and the desire to retrieve the disaster of Gerbes\r\nand they voted for Ferdinand the unprecedented _servicio_ or tax-levy of\r\nfive hundred thousand libras, obtaining in return the abolition of the\r\nSanta Hermandad.[702] Yet even this enthusiasm did not prevent murmurs\r\nof discontent, and complaints were made that the Inquisition assumed\r\njurisdiction over cases of usury, blasphemy, bigamy, necromancy and the\r\nlike and that the privileges and exemptions enjoyed by the officials led\r\nto their unnecessary multiplication, rendering the tribunals oppressive\r\nto those who bore the burdens of the state. Ferdinand eluded reform by\r\npromising it for the future and the Córtes were dissolved without\r\npositive action.[703] When they next met at Monzon, in 1512, they were\r\nin a less confiding mood and it is probable that popular agitation must\r\nhave assumed a threatening aspect, sufficient to compel Ferdinand to\r\nyield to their demands. An elaborate series of articles was drawn up, or\r\nrather two, one for Aragon and the other for Catalonia, nearly identical\r\nin character, which received the royal assent. It is significant that,\r\nwith the exception of a clause as to appeals, these articles do not\r\nconcern themselves with the prosecution of heresy but are confined to\r\nthe excesses with which the tribunals and their underlings afflicted the\r\nfaithful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE CONCORDIA OF MONZON_]\r\n\r\nThe reform demanded by Catalonia embraced thirty-four articles, a few of\r\nwhich may serve to suggest the abuses that had grown so rankly. An\r\nespecial grievance was the multiplication of officials--not only those\r\nengaged in the work of the tribunal but the unsalaried familiars\r\nscattered everywhere and the servants and slaves of all concerned, who\r\nall claimed the _fuero_, or jurisdiction of the Inquisition, with\r\nnumerous privileges and exemptions that rendered them a most undesirable\r\nelement in society. It was demanded that the number of familiars in\r\nCatalonia should be reduced to thirty-four, whose names should be made\r\nknown; that under the guise of servants should be included only those\r\nactually resident with their masters or employers; that no one guilty of\r\na grave offence should be appointed to office; that the privilege of\r\ncarrying arms should be restricted to those who bore commissions, in\r\ndefault of which they could be disarmed like other citizens; that the\r\nclaim to exemption from local taxes and imposts be abandoned; that\r\nofficials caught _flagrante delicto_ in crime should be subject to\r\narrest by secular officials without subjecting the latter to\r\nprosecution; that civil suits should be tried by the court of the\r\ndefendant; that the common clause in contracts by which one party\r\nsubjected himself to whatever court the other might name should be held\r\nnot to include the Inquisition; that the rule forbidding officials to\r\nengage in trade should be enforced; that officials buying claims or\r\nproperty in litigation should not transfer the cases to the Inquisition,\r\nnor use it to collect their rents; that inquisitors should not issue\r\nsafe-conducts except to witnesses coming to testify; that in cases of\r\nconfiscation, when the convict had been reputed a good Christian,\r\nparties who had bought property from him, had paid their debts to him or\r\nhad redeemed rent-charges, should not lose the property or be obliged to\r\npay the debts a second time; that the dowry of a Catholic wife should\r\nnot be confiscated because her father or husband should be subsequently\r\nconvicted of heresy; that possession for thirty years by a good Catholic\r\nshould bar confiscation of property formerly owned by those now\r\nconvicted of heresy and that the inquisitors should not elude this\r\nprescription of time by deducting periods of war, of minority, of\r\nignorance of the fisc and other similar devices; that the inquisitors\r\nshould withdraw their decree prohibiting all dealings with Conversos,\r\nwhich was not only a serious restraint of trade but involved much danger\r\nto individuals acting through ignorance. As regards the extension of\r\njurisdiction over subjects unconnected with heresy, the Inquisition was\r\nnot in future to take cognizance of usury, bigamy, blasphemy, and\r\nsorcery except in cases inferring erroneous belief. Remaining under\r\nexcommunication for a year involved suspicion of heresy and the Edict of\r\nFaith required the denunciation of all such cases to the Inquisition,\r\nbut as there were innumerable decrees of _ipso facto_ excommunications\r\nand others which were privately issued, it was impossible to know who\r\nwas or was not under the ban, wherefore the tribunal was not to take\r\naction except in cases where the censure had been publicly announced.\r\nThe extent to which the inquisitors had carried their arbitrary\r\nassumption of authority is indicated by an article forbidding them in\r\nthe future from interfering with the Diputados of Catalonia or their\r\nofficials in matters pertaining to their functions and the rights of the\r\nState and in the imposts of the cities, towns, and villages. The only\r\nreform proposed as to procedure is an article providing that appeals may\r\nlie from the local tribunal to the inquisitor-general and Suprema, with\r\nsuspension of sentences until they are heard. But there is a hideous\r\nsuggestiveness in the provision that, when perjured testimony has led to\r\nthe execution of an innocent man, the inquisitors shall do justice and\r\nshall not prevent the king from punishing the false witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe independence of the Inquisition, as an _imperium in imperío_, is\r\nexhibited in the fact that its acceptance was deemed necessary to each\r\nindividual article, an acceptance expressed by the subscription to each\r\nof _Plau a su Reverendissima senyoria_, the _senyoria_ being that of\r\nInquisitor-general Enguera. To confirm this he and the inquisitors were\r\nrequired to swear in a manner exhibiting the profound distrust\r\nentertained of them. The oath was to observe each and every article; it\r\nwas to be taken as a public act before a notary of the Inquisition, who\r\nwas to attest it officially and deliver it to the president of the\r\nCórtes, and authentic copies were to be supplied at the price of five\r\nsueldos to all demanding them. All future inquisitors, whether general\r\nor local, were to take the same oath on assuming office and all this\r\nwas repeated in various formulas so as to leave no loop-hole for\r\nequivocation. Ferdinand also took an oath promising to obtain from the\r\npope orders that all inquisitors, present and future should observe the\r\narticles and also that, whenever requested by the Córtes, the Diputados\r\nor the councillors of Barcelona, he would issue the necessary letters\r\nand provisions for their enforcement.[704] This was the first of the\r\nagreements which became known as _Concordias_--adjustments between the\r\npopular demands and the claims of the Holy Office. We shall have\r\nfrequent occasion to hear of them in the future, for they were often\r\nbroken and renewed and fresh sources of quarrel were never lacking. The\r\npresent one was not granted without a binding consideration, for the\r\ntribunal of Barcelona was granted six hundred libras a year, secured\r\nupon the public revenues.[705]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MERCADER'S INSTRUCTIONS_]\r\n\r\nIf the Catalans distrusted the good faith of king and inquisitor-general\r\nthey were not without justification, for the elaborate apparatus of\r\noaths proved a flimsy restraint on those who would endure no limitation\r\non their arbitrary and irresponsible authority. At first Ferdinand\r\nmanifested a desire to uphold the Concordia and to restrain the\r\ninquisitors who commenced at once to violate it. The city of Perpignan\r\ncomplained that the prescription of time was disregarded and that the\r\nduplicate payment of old debts was demanded, whereupon Ferdinand wrote,\r\nOctober 24, 1512, sharply ordering the strict observance of the terms\r\nagreed upon and the revocation of any acts contravening them.[706]\r\nBefore long however his policy changed and he sought relief. For\r\npotentates who desired to commit a deliberate breach of faith there was\r\nalways the resource of the authority of the Holy See which, among its\r\nmiscellaneous attributes, had long assumed that of releasing from\r\ninconvenient engagements those who could command its favor, and\r\nFerdinand's power in Italy was too great to permit of the refusal of so\r\ntrifling a request. Accordingly on April 30, 1513, Leo X issued a _motu\r\nproprio_ dispensing Ferdinand and Bishop Enguera from their oaths to\r\nobserve the Concordia of Monzon.[707]\r\n\r\nThe popular demands, however, had been too emphatically asserted to be\r\naltogether ignored and an attempt was made to satisfy them by a series\r\nof instructions drawn up, under date of August 28, 1514, by Bishop Luis\r\nMercader of Tortosa, who had succeeded Enguera as inquisitor-general.\r\nThese comprised many of the reforms in the Concordia, modified somewhat\r\nto suit inquisitorial views, as, for instance, the number of armed\r\nfamiliars permitted for Barcelona was twenty-five, with ten each for\r\nother cities. From Valladolid, September 10th, Ferdinand despatched\r\nthese instructions by Fernando de Montemayor, Archdeacon of Almazan, who\r\nwas going to Barcelona as visitor or inspector of the tribunal. It was\r\nnot until December 11th that they were read in Barcelona in presence of\r\nthe inquisitors and of representatives of Catalonia. The latter demanded\r\ntime for their consideration and a copy was given to them. Another\r\nmeeting was held, January 10, 1515, and a third on January 25th, in\r\nwhich the instructions were published and the inquisitors promised to\r\nobey them. There is no record that the Catalans accepted them as a\r\nfulfilment of the Concordia and, if they were asked to do so, it was\r\nmerely as a matter of policy. In a letter of January 4th to the\r\narchdeacon, Ferdinand assumes that the assent of the Catalans was a\r\nmatter of indifference; the instructions were to be published without\r\nfurther parley and no reference to Rome was requisite as the privileges\r\nof the Inquisition were not curtailed by them.[708]\r\n\r\nSubsequent Córtes were held at Monzon and Lérida, where the popular\r\ndissatisfaction found expression in further complaints and demands,\r\nleading to some concessions on the part of Ferdinand. The temper of the\r\npeople was rising and manifested itself in occasional assaults,\r\nsometimes fatal, on inquisitorial officials, to facilitate the\r\npunishment of which Leo X, by a brief of January 28, 1515, authorized\r\ninquisitors to try such delinquents and hand them over to the secular\r\narm for execution, without incurring the \"irregularity\" consequent on\r\njudgements of blood.[709] Ferdinand was too shrewd to provoke his\r\nsubjects too far; he recognized that the overbearing arrogance of the\r\ninquisitors and their illegal extension of their authority gave great\r\noffence, even to the well-affected, and he was ready to curb their\r\npetulance. A case occurring in May, 1515, shows how justifiable were the\r\npopular complaints and gave him opportunity to administer a severe\r\nrebuke. It was the law in Aragon that, when the Diputados appointed any\r\none as lieutenant to the Justicia, if he refused to serve they were to\r\nremove his name from the lists of those eligible to public office. A\r\ncertain Micer Manuel, so appointed, refused to serve and to escape the\r\npenalty procured from the inquisitors of Saragossa letters prohibiting,\r\nunder pain of excommunication, the Diputados from striking off his name.\r\nThis arbitrary interference with public affairs gave great offence and\r\nFerdinand sharply told the inquisitors not to meddle with matters that\r\nin no way concerned their office; the Diputados were under oath to\r\nexecute the law and the letters must be at once revoked.[710] Finally he\r\nrecognized that the demands of the Córtes of Monzon had been justified\r\nand that he had done wrong in violating the Concordia of 1512. One of\r\nhis latest acts was a cédula of December 24, 1515, announcing to the\r\ninquisitors that he had applied to the Holy See for confirmation of the\r\nagreements made and sworn to in the Córtes of Monzon and Lérida; there\r\nwas no doubt that this would speedily be granted, wherefore he straitly\r\ncommanded, under pain of forfeiture of office, that the articles must\r\nnot be violated in any manner, direct or indirect, but must be observed\r\nto the letter; the inquisitor-general had agreed to this and would swear\r\nto comply with the bull when it should come.[711]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FURTHER DEMANDS_]\r\n\r\nFerdinand died January 23, 1516, followed in June by Inquisitor-general\r\nMercader. Leo X probably waited to learn whether the new monarch Charles\r\ndesired to continue the policy of his grandfather. It is true that he\r\nhad dispensed Ferdinand and Enguera from their oaths in view of the\r\ngreat offence to God and danger to conscience involved in the observance\r\nof the Concordia, but a word from the monarch was sufficient to overcome\r\nhis scruples. What Ferdinand had felt it necessary to concede could not\r\nbe withheld when, in the youth and absence of Charles, his\r\nrepresentatives could scarce repress the turbulent elements of civil\r\ndiscord. Accordingly Leo confirmed all the articles of both the Catalan\r\nand Aragonese Concordias by the bull _Pastoralis officii_, August 1,\r\n1516, in which he declared that the officials of the Inquisition\r\nfrequently transgressed the bounds of reason and propriety in their\r\nabuse of their privileges, immunities and exemptions and that their\r\novergrown numbers reduced almost to nullity the jurisdiction of the\r\nordinary ecclesiastical and secular courts. This action, he says, is\r\ntaken at the especial prayer of King Charles and Queen Juana and all\r\ninquisitors and officials contravening its prescriptions, if they do\r\nnot, within three days after summons, revoke their unlawful acts, are\r\nsubject to excommunication _latæ sententiæ_, deprivation of office and\r\nperpetual disability for re-employment, _ipso facto_. Moreover the\r\nArchbishops of Saragossa and Tarragona were authorized and required,\r\nwhenever called upon by the authorities, to compel the observance of the\r\nbull by ecclesiastical censures and other remedies without appeal,\r\ninvoking if necessary the secular arm.[712]\r\n\r\nThus, after four years of struggle, the Concordias of 1512 were\r\nconfirmed in the most absolute manner and the relations between the\r\nInquisition and the people appeared to be permanently settled. The\r\ninquisitors however, as usual, refused to be bound by any limitations.\r\nThey claimed, and acted on the claim, that the papal bull of\r\nconfirmation was surreptitious and not entitled to obedience and that\r\nboth the Concordias and the Instructions of Bishop Mercader were invalid\r\nas being restrictions impeding the jurisdiction of the Holy Office.[713]\r\nOn the other hand the people grew more restive and increased their\r\ndemands for relief. The occasion presented itself when Charles came to\r\nSpain to assume possession of his mother's dominions. At Córtes held in\r\nSaragossa, May, 1518, he received the allegiance of Aragon and swore to\r\nobserve the fueros of the Córtes of Saragossa, Tarazona and Monzon.\r\nMoney was soon wanted to supply the reckless liberality with which he\r\nfilled the pouches of his greedy Flemings, and towards the end of the\r\nyear he summoned another assembly to grant him a _subsidio_. It agreed\r\nto raise 200,000 libras but coupled this with a series of thirty-one\r\narticles, much more advanced than anything hitherto demanded in\r\nAragon--in fact copied with little change from those agreed to in\r\nCastile by Jean le Sauvage and abandoned in consequence of his\r\ndeath--articles which revolutionized inquisitorial procedure and\r\nassimilated it to that of the secular criminal courts. Charles, in these\r\nmatters was now wholly under the influence of his former tutor and\r\npresent inquisitor-general Cardinal Adrian. He wanted the money,\r\nhowever, and he gave an equivocal consent to the articles; it was, he\r\nsaid, his will that in each and all the holy canons should be observed,\r\nwith the decrees of the Holy See and without attempting anything to the\r\ncontrary. If doubts arose the pope should be asked to decide them; if\r\nany one desired to accuse inquisitors or officials, he could do so\r\nbefore the inquisitor-general, who would call in counsellors and\r\nadminister justice, or, if the crime appertained to the secular courts,\r\nhe would see that justice was speedy. This declaration, with the\r\ninterpretation to be put on each and every article by the pope, he\r\npromised under oath to observe and enforce and he further swore not to\r\nseek dispensation from this oath or to avail himself of it if\r\nobtained.[714] The people were amply justified in distrusting their\r\nrulers, for Charles subsequently instructed the Count of Cifuentes, his\r\nambassador at Rome, to procure the revocation of the articles and a\r\ndispensation from his oath to observe them.[715]\r\n\r\nCharles had thus shuffled off from his shoulders to those of the pope\r\nthe responsibility for this grave alteration in inquisitorial procedure\r\nwhich, by forcing the Holy Office to administer open justice, would have\r\ndiminished so greatly its powers of evil. The question was thus\r\ntransferred to Rome and the Córtes lost no time in seeking to obtain\r\nfrom Leo X the confirmation of the articles. A letter requesting this\r\nwas procured from Charles and was forwarded to Rome with a copy of the\r\narticles and of Charles's oath, officially authenticated by Juan Prat,\r\nthe notary of the Córtes. The papers were sent to Rome by a certain\r\nDiego de las Casas, a Converso of Seville who, as his subsequent history\r\nshows, must have been amply provided with the funds necessary to secure\r\na favorable hearing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _STRUGGLE IN SARAGOSSA_]\r\n\r\nThe situation was one which called for active measures on the part of\r\nthe Inquisition. The Córtes dissolved January 17, 1519, and a letter of\r\nthe 22d, from the Suprema to the Inquisitor of Calatayud, shows that\r\nalready steps had been taken to prosecute all who had endeavored to\r\ninfluence them against the Inquisition or who had made complaints to\r\nCharles or Adrian.[716] A more effective and bolder scheme was to accuse\r\nJuan Prat of having falsified the series of articles sent to Rome.\r\nCharles had appointed a commission, consisting of the Archbishop of\r\nSaragossa, Cardinal Adrian and Chancellor Gattinara, to consider all\r\nmatters connected with the Inquisition; to them Prat had submitted the\r\narticles which they returned to him with a declaration, which must have\r\nbeen an approval as its character was studiously suppressed in the\r\nsubsequent proceedings. Notwithstanding this the Saragossa inquisitors,\r\nPedro Arbués and Toribio Saldaña promptly reported to Charles, who had\r\nleft Saragossa for Barcelona, that Prat had falsified the articles and\r\nCharles, from Igualada, February 4th, replied ordering them to obey the\r\ninstructions of Cardinal Adrian and collect evidence as to the\r\nfalsifications which they claimed to have discovered. They postponed\r\naction, however, for some weeks until the archbishop had left the city\r\nand did not arrest Prat until March 16th. Their investigation revealed\r\nsome trivial irregularities but nothing to invalidate the accuracy of\r\nthe articles transmitted to Rome, yet on the 18th they communicated to\r\nthe Suprema the results of their labors as though the whole record was\r\nvitiated and Prat had been guilty of falsification. A way thus was\r\nopened to escape from the engagements entered into with the Córtes. A\r\nseries of articles was drawn up, signed by Gattinara, which was sent to\r\nRome as the genuine one and urgent letters were despatched, April 30th,\r\nto all the Roman agents, the pope and four of the cardinals in the\r\nSpanish interest, stating that the official copy was falsified, the\r\ngenuine one was that bearing Gattinara's name, the honor of God was\r\ninvolved and the safety of the Catholic faith and no effort was to be\r\nspared to secure the papal confirmation of the right articles.\r\n\r\nTo justify this it was necessary that Prat should be convicted and\r\npunished. Apparently fearing that this could not be accomplished in\r\nSaragossa, Cardinal Adrian ordered the inquisitors to send him to\r\nBarcelona for trial, in ignorance that this was in violation of one of\r\nthe dearest of the Aragonese privileges forbidding the deportation of\r\nany citizen against his will. This aroused a storm and the leading\r\nofficials of Church and State interposed so effectually with the\r\ninquisitors that Prat was allowed to remain in the secret prison of the\r\nAljafería. The quarrel was now assuming serious proportions; not only\r\nwas the kingdom aflame with this attempted violation of its privileges\r\nbut it was universally believed that Charles had granted all the demands\r\nof the Córtes in return for the servicio and his interference with the\r\npapal confirmation was bitterly resented. The Diputados summoned the\r\ninquisitors to obey the Concordia of 1512, as confirmed by the bull of\r\nAugust 1, 1516, while awaiting confirmation of the new Concordia and at\r\nthe same time they called the barons and magnates of the realm to a\r\nconference at Fuentes, whence, on May 9th, they sent to Charles a\r\nremonstrance more emphatic than respectful, with an intimation that the\r\nservicio would not be collected until Prat should be released, the\r\npretext being that the papers relating to it were in his office.\r\n\r\nTo this Charles responded loftily, May 17th, that for no personal\r\ninterest would he neglect his soul and conscience nor, to preserve his\r\nkingdom, would he allow anything against the honor of God and to the\r\ndetriment of the Holy Office. Under threat of excommunication and other\r\nsevere penalties he ordered the Diputados not to convoke the Estates of\r\nthe realm or to send envoys to him; he would comply with the Concordia\r\nand had already asked its confirmation of the pope--the fact being that\r\nhe had on May 7th written to Rome--and this he repeated May 29th--to\r\nimpede the confirmation of the official Concordia and to urge that of\r\nhis own version. There was a rumor that the Estates on May 14th had\r\nresolved to take Prat from the Aljafería by force and to meet this, on\r\nMay 17th, he sent the Comendador García de Loaisa to Saragossa with\r\ninstructions to arm the Cofradia of San Pedro Martir--an association\r\nconnected with the Inquisition--to raise the people and to meet force\r\nwith force. The authorities were to be bullied and told that the king\r\nwould assert his sovereign authority and that nothing should prevent the\r\nextradition of Prat. In the hands of his ghostly advisers he was\r\nprepared to risk civil war in defence of the abuses of the Inquisition.\r\nThere was fear that the inquisitors might be intimidated into releasing\r\nPrat and Cardinal Adrian took the unprecedented step of writing directly\r\nto the gaoler of the Aljafería instructing him to disobey any such\r\norders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _STRUGGLE IN SARAGOSSA_]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this assertion of absolutism, Charles's orders were treated\r\nwith contempt. The Córtes met at Azuaga, refused to obey his angry\r\ncommands to disperse and sent to him Don Sancho de la Caballería with\r\nthe unpleasant message that the servicio would be withheld until he\r\nshould grant justice to the kingdom. His finances, in the hands of his\r\nFlemish favorites, were in complete disorder. The Emperor Maximilian had\r\ndied January 22d and the contest for the succession, against the gold of\r\nFrancis I, was expensive. Moreover, in expectation of the servicio,\r\nChièvres had obtained advances at usurious interest so that the expected\r\nfunds were already nearly exhausted and, as soon as the electoral\r\nstruggle ended in Charles's nomination, June 28th, there came fresh\r\ndemands for funds to prepare for his voyage to assume his new dignity.\r\nChièvres therefore eagerly sought for some compromise to relieve the\r\ndead-lock, but the Aragonese on the one hand and Cardinal Adrian on the\r\nother were intractable. The high-handed arrest of Prat had fatally\r\ncomplicated the situation.\r\n\r\nCharles yielded in so far as to order that Prat should not be removed\r\nfrom the kingdom and several tentative propositions were made as to the\r\ntrial of Prat which only show how little he and his advisers realized\r\nthe true condition of affairs. With wonted Aragonese tenacity the\r\nDiputados adhered to the position that the accuracy of the record should\r\nnot be called in question and that the only point to be determined was\r\nwhether the Inquisition rightfully had any jurisdiction in the matter.\r\nAt the same time, to show that they were not seeking to elude payment of\r\nthe servicio they agreed on September 7th to levy it, at the same time\r\nbegging Charles to release Prat.\r\n\r\nThey were probably led to make this concession by a victory which they\r\nhad gained in Rome. Both sides had been vigorously at work there, but\r\nthe Aragonese had the advantage that Leo X at the moment was incensed\r\nagainst the Spanish Inquisition because of the insolent insubordination\r\nof the Toledo tribunal in the case of Bernardino Díaz, of which more\r\nhereafter. His own experience showed him of what it was capable and the\r\nrequest of the Córtes for the confirmation of the Concordia was to a\r\ngreat extent granted by three briefs, received August 1st, addressed\r\nrespectively to the king, to Cardinal Adrian and to the inquisitors of\r\nSaragossa, reducing the Inquisition to the rules of the common law.\r\nCharles did not allow the briefs to be published and, when the Diputados\r\npresented to the inquisitors the one addressed to them, they refused to\r\nobey it without instructions from Adrian, whereupon, on August 8th, the\r\nDiputados applied to Rome for some further remedy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the briefs were thus dormant they became the central point of\r\nthe contest. On September 24th, Charles despatched to Rome Lope Hurtado\r\nde Mendoza as a special envoy with long and detailed instructions. He\r\nhad been advised, he said that the pope intended to issue a bull\r\nrevoking all inquisitorial commissions, save that of Cardinal Adrian;\r\nthat in future the bishops with their chapters in each see were to\r\nnominate two persons of whom the inquisitor-general was to select the\r\nfittest and present him to the pope for confirmation; the acts of these\r\ninquisitors were to be judicially investigated every two years, and\r\ntheir procedure was to conform to the common law and to the canons. The\r\nelaborate arguments which Charles urged against each feature of this\r\nrevolutionary plan show that it was not a figment but was seriously\r\nproposed with likelihood of its adoption. Moreover he said that\r\ninfluences were at work to secure the removal of the _sanbenitos_ of\r\nconvicts from the churches, against which he earnestly protested;\r\nFerdinand had refused three hundred thousand ducats offered to him to\r\nprocure this concession. In conclusion Charles declared that no\r\nimportunity should shake his determination to make no change in the\r\nInquisition and he significantly expressed his desire to preserve the\r\nfriendship of his Holiness.\r\n\r\nWhat secret influences were at work to effect a complete reversal of\r\npapal policy it would be vain to guess, but Mendoza had scarce time to\r\nreach Rome when he procured a brief of October 12th, addressed to\r\nCardinal Adrian. In this Sadoleto's choicest Latinity was employed to\r\ncover up the humiliation of conscious wrong-doing, in its effort to\r\nshift the responsibility to the shoulders of others. Charles's letters\r\nand Mendoza's message had enlightened him as to the intentions of the\r\nking with regard to the preservation of the faith and the reform of the\r\nInquisition. He promised that he would change nothing and would publish\r\nnothing without the assent of the king and the information of the\r\ninquisitor-general, but he dwelt on the complaints that reached him from\r\nall quarters of the avarice and iniquity of the inquisitors; he warned\r\nAdrian that the infamy of the wickedness of his sub-delegates redounded\r\nto the dishonor of the nation and affected both him and the king; he was\r\nresponsible and must seek to preserve his own honor and that of the king\r\nby seeing that they desist from the insolence with which they\r\ndisregarded the papal mandates and rebelled against the Holy See.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _STRUGGLE IN SARAGOSSA_]\r\n\r\nWhile thus the three briefs were not revoked they were practically\r\nannulled. The indignation of the Aragonese at finding themselves thus\r\njuggled was warm and found expression, January 30, 1520, in\r\ndiscontinuing the collection of the servicio. Charles was now at Coruña,\r\npreparing for his voyage to Flanders and thither, on February 3d, the\r\nDiputados sent Azor Zapata and Iñigo de Mendoza to procure the\r\nliberation of Prat and to urge Charles to obtain the confirmation of the\r\nConcordia. To liberate Prat without a trial was tacitly to admit the\r\ncorrectness of his record, yet, on April 21st, Cardinal Adrian issued an\r\norder for the fiscal to discontinue the prosecution and for the\r\ninquisitors to \"relax\" Prat. This order was presented May 1st to the\r\ninquisitors, but the word \"relaxation\" was that used in the delivery of\r\nconvicts to the secular arm for burning; Prat stoutly refused to accept\r\nit and remained in prison.\r\n\r\nCharles embarked May 21st and the rest of the year 1520 was spent in\r\nendeavors by each side to obtain the confirmation of their respective\r\nformulas of the Concordia and in fruitless attempts by Charles to have\r\nthe three briefs revoked. Though unpublished and virtually annulled they\r\nwere the source of great anxiety to the Inquisition. The correspondence\r\nbetween Charles and his Roman agents shows perpetual insistance on his\r\npart and perpetual promises and evasions by the pope, sometimes on the\r\nflimsiest pretexts for postponement, the secret of which is probably to\r\nbe found in a report by Juan Manuel, the Spanish ambassador, on October\r\n12th, that the pope was promised 46,000 or 47,000 ducats if he could\r\ninduce the king to let the briefs stand. Thus it went on throughout the\r\nyear and, when Leo died, December 1, 1521, the briefs were still\r\nunrevoked.\r\n\r\nA year earlier, however, December 1, 1520, he had confirmed the\r\nConcordia, in a bull so carefully drawn as not to commit the Holy See to\r\neither of the contesting versions. It was limited to the promises\r\nembraced in Charles's oath and, as regards the articles, it merely said\r\nthat the canons and ordinances and papal decrees should be inviolably\r\nobserved, under pain of _ipso facto_ excommunication, dismissal from\r\noffice and disability for re-appointment. Either side was consequently\r\nat liberty to put what construction it pleased on the papal utterance.\r\n\r\nCharles meanwhile had been growing more and more impatient for the\r\nservicio so long withheld; he had written to Adrian and also to the\r\ninquisitors, ordering that the Concordia of Monzon (1512) and that of\r\nSaragossa, according to his version, should be strictly obeyed, so that\r\nthe abuses thus sought to be corrected should cease and the people\r\nshould pay the impost. The inquisitors dallied and seem to have asked\r\nhim what articles he referred to for he replied, September 17th,\r\nexplaining that they were those of Monzon and Saragossa, the latter as\r\nexpressed in the paper signed by Adrian and Gattinara. When, therefore,\r\nhe received the papal confirmation of December 1st he lost no time in\r\nwriting, December 18th, to Adrian and the inquisitors announcing it and\r\nordering the articles to be rigidly observed without gloss or\r\ninterpretation, so that the abuses and disorders prohibited in them may\r\ncease, but he was careful to describe the articles as those agreed upon\r\nat Monzon and lately confirmed at Saragossa in the form adopted by\r\nAdrian and Gattinara.\r\n\r\nThe Aragonese, on the other hand, adhered to their version. The bull of\r\nconfirmation seems to have reached Saragossa through Flanders,\r\naccompanied by a letter from Charles and it was not until January 15,\r\n1521, that the Diputados wrote to Adrian enclosing the royal letter and\r\na copy of the bull. In obeying it, he conceded the Aragonese version of\r\nthe Concordia, though with a bad grace. From Tordesillas, January 28th,\r\nhe wrote to the Diputados and the inquisitors that the bull must be\r\nobeyed although it might properly be considered surreptitious, as it\r\nasserted that Charles had sworn to the fictitious articles inserted by\r\nJuan Prat, for which the latter deserved the severest punishment. In\r\nspite of this burst of petulance, however, he practically admitted\r\nPrat's innocence by ordering his liberation and, on February 13, 1521,\r\nthe order was carried in triumph by the governor, the Diputados and a\r\nconcourse of nobles and citizens to the Aljafería and solemnly presented\r\nto the inquisitors, who asked for copies and, with these in their hands,\r\nsaid that they would do their duty without swerving from justice and\r\nreason. So well satisfied were the Aragonese that to show their\r\ngratitude they had already, on January 18th, ordered the cities and\r\ntowns to pay all current imposts as well as the suspended subsidio\r\nwithin thirty-five days. It may be added that finally Cardinal Adrian\r\nrecognized the innocence of Prat in the most formal manner, in a letter\r\nof April 20th to the inquisitors, imposing silence on the fiscal and\r\nordering the discharge of Prat and his securities.[717]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _STRUGGLE IN BARCELONA_]\r\n\r\nTriumph and gratitude were alike misplaced. Cardinal Adrian had followed\r\nhis letter of January 28th with another of the 30th to the inquisitors,\r\ninstructing them that the papal confirmation must be construed in\r\naccordance with the sacred canons and the decrees of the Holy See, so\r\nthat they could continue to administer justice duly and he encouraged\r\nthem with an _ayuda de costa_ or gratuity.[718] They went on\r\nimperturbably with their work; not only was the Concordia of Saragossa\r\nnever observed but that of Monzon was treated as non-existent and we\r\nshall see hereafter that, towards the close of the century, the\r\nInquisition coolly asserted that the latter had been invalidated when\r\nLeo X released Ferdinand from his oath to observe it and that the former\r\nhad never been confirmed and that there was no trace of either having\r\never been observed. The Inquisition, in fact, was invulnerable and\r\nimpenetrable. It made its own laws and there was no power in the land,\r\nsave that of the crown, that could force it to keep its engagements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the obstinacy of the Catalans, which detained the impatient\r\nCharles in Barcelona throughout the year 1519, secured, nominally at\r\nleast, the formal confirmation by both Charles and Adrian, of the Monzon\r\nConcordia of 1512 with additions. One of these provided that any one who\r\nentered the service of the Holy Office while liable to a civil or\r\ncriminal action, should still be held to answer before his former judge,\r\nand that criminal offences, unconnected with the faith, committed by\r\nofficials should be exclusively justiciable in the civil courts. This\r\nstruck at the root of one of the most serious abuses--the immunity with\r\nwhich the Inquisition shielded its criminals--and scarcely less\r\nimportant to all who had dealings with New Christians was another\r\narticle providing that property acquired in good faith, from one reputed\r\nto be a Christian, should be exempt from confiscation in case the\r\nseller should subsequently be convicted, even though the thirty years'\r\nprescription should still exist.[719]\r\n\r\nThe agreement was reached January 11, 1520, but experience of the\r\nfaithlessness of the Inquisition had made the Catalans wary. They were\r\nabout to grant a servicio to Charles and they sought a guarantee by\r\naddressing to him a supplication that he should make Cardinal Adrian\r\nswear to the observance of the Concordia of 1512 and the new articles\r\nand that he should procure within four months from the pope a bull of\r\nconfirmation, in which the Bishops of Lérida and Barcelona should be\r\nappointed conservators, with full power to enforce the agreement. They\r\noffered to pay two hundred ducats towards the cost of the bull and they\r\ndemanded that they should retain twenty thousand libras of the servicio\r\nuntil the bull should be delivered to the Diputados. The same condition\r\nwas attached to a liberal donation of twelve thousand libras which they\r\nmade to the Inquisition--probably a part of the bargain. Meanwhile\r\nCharles was to give orders that the inquisitors should be bound by the\r\narticles and, in case of infraction, satisfaction for such violations\r\nshould be deducted from the twenty thousand libras. In due time, August\r\n25th, Leo X executed a formal bull of confirmation of the articles of\r\n1512 and 1520 and appointed the Bishops of Lérida and Barcelona as\r\nconservators.[720]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ABUSES CONTINUE_]\r\n\r\nWhat was the value of the Concordia thus solemnly agreed to and\r\nliberally paid for, with its papal confirmation and conservators, was\r\nspeedily seen when, in 1523, the authorities of Perpignan became\r\ninvolved in a quarrel with Inquisitor Juan Naverdu over the case of the\r\nwife of Juan Noguer. They complained of an infraction of the Concordia\r\nand applied to the Bishop of Lérida for its enforcement. He appointed\r\nMiguel Roig, a canon of Elna, as the executor of his decision, who\r\nissued letters ordering the inquisitor and his secretary to observe the\r\nConcordia, under pain of excommunication, and to drop the cases which\r\nthey were prosecuting. Appeal was also made to Rome and letters were\r\nobtained from Clement VII. Charles, however, intervened and obtained\r\nanother brief, January 6, 1524, annulling the previous one and\r\ntransferring the matter to Inquisitor-general Manrique. The result was\r\nthat nearly all the magistrates of Perpignan--the consuls and jurados\r\nwith their lawyers and Miguel Roig--were obliged to swear obedience in\r\nall things to the Inquisition, were exposed to the irredeemable disgrace\r\nof appearing as penitents at the mass and were subjected to fines from\r\nwhich the Holy Office gathered in the comfortable sum of 1115\r\nducats.[721] The motto of the Inquisition was _noli me tangere_ and it\r\nadministered a sharp lesson to all who might venture, even under papal\r\nauthority, to make it conform to its agreements.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that the sturdy subjects of the crown of Aragon struggled\r\nand gained concessions, paid for them and fenced them around with all\r\nthe precautions held sacred by public law. The inquisitors felt\r\nthemselves to be above the law and all the old abuses continued to\r\nflourish as rankly as ever. About this time the Córtes of the three\r\nkingdoms, by command of Charles, addressed to Inquisitor-general\r\nManrique a series of sixteen grievances, repeating the old\r\ncomplaints--the extension of jurisdiction over usury, blasphemy, bigamy\r\nand sodomy; the acceptance by the inquisitors of commissions to act as\r\nconservators in secular and ecclesiastical cases and profane matters;\r\ntheir arresting people for private quarrels and on trivial charges and\r\ninsufficient evidence, leaving on them and their descendants an\r\nineffaceable stain, even though they were discharged without penance;\r\ntheir multiplication of familiars and concealing their names, appointing\r\ncriminals and protecting them in their crimes and finally their\r\noverbearing and insulting attitude in general. In answer to this the\r\ninquisitor-general contented himself with asserting that the laws were\r\nobeyed and asking for specific instances of infraction and the names of\r\nthe parties--secure that no one would dare to come forward and expose\r\nhimself to the vengeance of the tribunal.[722] Again, in 1528 at the\r\nCórtes of Monzon, we find a repetition of grievances--the abuse of\r\nconfiscations, the cognizance of usury and other matters disconnected\r\nwith heresy and general inobservance of the articles agreed upon. To the\r\npetition that he remedy these and procure from the inquisitor-general\r\nan order to his subordinates to conform themselves to the Concordias,\r\nCharles returned the equivocating answer \"His majesty will see that the\r\ninquisitor-general orders the observance of that which should be\r\nobserved, removing abuses if there are any.\"[723]\r\n\r\nThe imperial attitude was not such as to discourage the audacity of the\r\ninquisitors and, at the Córtes of Monzon in September, 1533, the\r\ndeputies of Aragon presented to Inquisitor-general Manrique, who was\r\npresent, two series of grievances. One of these he promptly answered by\r\ncharacterizing some of the demands as impertinent, scandalous, and\r\nillegal, and others as not worthy of reply. The other series was\r\nreferred to Charles and was not answered until December. It commenced by\r\nasking that the Concordia confirmed by Leo X, in 1516, should be\r\nobserved, to which the reply was that such action should be taken as\r\nwould comport with the service of God and proper exercise of the\r\nInquisition. The request that the inquisitors confine themselves to\r\nmatters of faith was met with the assertion that they did so, except\r\nwhen under orders from their superiors. To the demand that the dowries\r\nof Catholic wives should not be confiscated, the dry response was that\r\nthe laws should be observed. In this cavalier spirit the rest of the\r\npetition was disposed of, and the whole shows how completely the Holy\r\nOffice was emancipated from any subjection to the laws which had cost\r\nsuch struggles to obtain and which had been paid for so largely.[724]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ABUSES CONTINUE_]\r\n\r\nWhile Manrique and the Suprema were at Monzon, they were called upon to\r\ntake action with regard to troubles at Barcelona between the inquisitor,\r\nFernando de Loazes and the magistrates and Diputados. These had been on\r\nfoot for some time. A letter of Charles from Bologna, February 25, 1533,\r\nto Loazes assures him of his sympathy and support and, in September, the\r\nSuprema at Monzon resolved to send a judge thither to prosecute and\r\npunish the offenders for their enormous delinquencies.[725] What were\r\nthe merits of the quarrel do not appear, but it was doubtless provoked\r\nby the overbearing arrogance of Loazes for, at the Córtes of Monzon, the\r\nCatalans represented to Charles that the pretensions of the inquisitor\r\nimpeded the course of justice in matters involving the _regalías_ or\r\nprerogatives of the crown, and asked to have him prosecuted by the\r\nBishop of Barcelona. Charles thereupon addressed to Loazes a letter\r\nJanuary 16, 1534, forbidding him in future to interfere with the royal\r\njudges, as no one could claim exemption from the royal jurisdiction. At\r\nthe same time he instructed his lieutenant for Aragon, Fadrique de\r\nPortugal, Archbishop of Saragossa, to enforce this mandate. It was not\r\nlong before Loazes had the opportunity of manifesting his contempt for\r\nthese expressions of the royal will. One of the consuls holding the\r\nadmiralty court of Barcelona was hearing a case between two merchants,\r\nJoan Ribas and Gerald Camps: a quarrel ensued between them; Ribas with\r\nhis servant Joan Monseny struck Camps in the face and then drawing his\r\nsword, threatened the consul's life. This was a scandalous offence to\r\nthe dignity of the crown under whose protection the court was held. By\r\norder of the Archbishop and royal council the culprits were arrested and\r\nthrown in prison, but Ribas was a familiar of the Inquisition and Loazes\r\npresented himself before the archbishop in full court and claimed him.\r\nThe letters of Charles V were read and his claim was rejected,\r\nwhereupon, on June 13th, he issued a mandate demanding the surrender to\r\nhim of Ribas and forbidding all proceedings against him under pain of\r\nexcommunication.[726] What was the termination of this special case we\r\nhave no means of knowing, but Loazes did not suffer by reason of his\r\naudacity. In 1542 he was made Bishop of Elna, whence he passed by\r\nsuccessive translations through the sees of Lérida, Tortosa and\r\nTarragona, dying at last, full of years and honors in 1568 as Archbishop\r\nof Valencia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while at present to pursue these disputes which reveal\r\nthe character of the Inquisition and the resistance offered to it by the\r\ncomparatively free populations subject to the crown of Aragon. We shall\r\nhave ample opportunity hereafter to note the persistant arrogance of the\r\ninquisitors under the royal favor, the restlessness of the people and\r\nthe fruitlessness of their struggle for relief from oppression. The Holy\r\nOffice had become part of the settled policy of the House of Austria.\r\nThe Lutheran revolt had grown to enormous proportions and no measures\r\nseemed too severe that would protect the faith from an enemy even more\r\ninsidious and more dangerous than Judaism. The system grew to be an\r\nintegral part of the national institutions to be uprooted only by the\r\ncataclysm of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic war. At what cost\r\nto the people this was effected is seen in the boast, in 1638, of a\r\nlearned official of the Inquisition that in its favor the monarchs had\r\nsucceeded in breaking down the municipal laws and privileges of their\r\nkingdoms, which otherwise would have presented insuperable obstacles to\r\nthe extermination of heresy, and he proceeds to enumerate the various\r\nrestrictions on the arbitrary power of the secular courts which the\r\nexperience of ages had framed for the protection of the citizen from\r\noppression, all of which had been swept away where the Inquisition was\r\nconcerned, leaving the subject to the discretion of the\r\ninquisitor.[727]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS WITH THE STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS WITH THE CROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat gave to the Spanish Inquisition its peculiar and terrible\r\nefficiency were the completeness of its organization and its combination\r\nof the mysterious authority of the Church with the secular power of the\r\ncrown. The old Inquisition was purely an ecclesiastical institution,\r\nempowered, it is true, to call upon the State for aid and for the\r\nexecution of its sentences, but throughout Christendom the relations\r\nbetween Church and State were too often antagonistic for its commands\r\nalways to receive obedience. In Spain, however, the Inquisition\r\nrepresented not only the pope but the king; it practically wielded the\r\ntwo swords--the spiritual and the temporal--and the combination produced\r\na tyranny, similar in character, but far more minute and all-pervading,\r\nto that which England suffered during the closing years of Henry VIII as\r\nSupreme Head of the Church.\r\n\r\nWhile thus its domination over the people was secure and unvarying, its\r\nrelations with the royal power varied with the temperament of the\r\nsovereign. At times it was the instrument of his will; at others it\r\nseemed as though it might almost supplant the monarchy; it was\r\nconstantly seeking to extend its awful authority over the other\r\ndepartments of State, which struggled with varying success to resist its\r\nencroachments, while successive kings, autocratic in theory, sometimes\r\nposed as arbitrators, sometimes vainly endeavored to enforce their\r\npacificatory commands, but more generally yielded to its domineering\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FERDINAND'S CONTROL_]\r\n\r\nWhen Ferdinand consented to the introduction of the Inquisition, it was\r\nno part of his policy to permit the foundation of an institution which\r\nshould be independent of the royal authority. He who sought to forbid in\r\nSpain the residence of papal nuncios and legates was not likely to\r\nwelcome the advent of a new swarm of papal delegates, whose power over\r\nlife and property would carry unchecked to every corner of the land the\r\ninfluence of Rome. Accordingly, as we have seen, he conditioned the\r\nadmission of the Inquisition on the concession of the power of\r\nappointment and dismissal and he flatly told Sixtus IV that he would\r\npermit none but appointees of his own to exercise the office of\r\ninquisitor. As the institution developed and became more complex he\r\nnominated to the pope the individual to whom the papal delegation as\r\ninquisitor-general should be given and he appointed the members of the\r\nSuprema, which became known as the _Consejo de su Magestad de la Santa\r\nGeneral Inquisicion_. Although the papal commission granted to the\r\ninquisitor-general faculties of subdelegating his powers and appointing\r\nand dismissing his subordinates, thus rendering his action\r\nindispensable, Ferdinand was careful to assert his right to control all\r\nappointments and to assume that at least they were made with his assent\r\nand concurrence. In 1485 the sovereigns had no scruple in appointing at\r\nGuadalupe the inquisitors who made such havoc among the apostates.[728]\r\nAugust 8, 1500, he writes to the Bishop of Bonavalle that he had\r\ndetermined to commit to him the office of inquisitor in Sardinia, for\r\nwhich the commission and subdelegation will be despatched to him by the\r\ninquisitors-general; he can appoint an assessor and notary, but the\r\nother officials will be sent from Spain. A letter of the same date to\r\nthe Lieutenant-general of Sardinia announces the appointment by the\r\ninquisitors-general \"con nuestra voluntad y consentimiento,\" which was\r\nthe ordinary formula employed, even in such petty cases as when he\r\nadvised Pedro Badía, receiver of confiscations at Barcelona, March 13,\r\n1501, that they had appointed Gregorio Zamarado as _portero_ or\r\napparitor of that tribunal, in place of Guillen Donadou and that he is\r\nto receive the same wages.[729] Although the participation of the\r\ninquisitor-general was indispensable, Ferdinand customarily assumed his\r\nacquiescence as a matter of course; he would make the appointment and\r\nthen ask affectionately for the subdelegation of power.[730] As regards\r\nsubordinate positions, Torquemada recognized the royal participation\r\nwhen, in 1485, he instructed inquisitors that they could fill vacancies\r\ntemporarily \"until the king and I provide for them.\" As a rule, it may\r\nbe said that Ferdinand rarely troubled himself about subordinates, but\r\nhad no hesitation in assuming full power when he saw fit, as in writing\r\nto an inquisitor, March 21, 1499, \"we order you to appoint, as by these\r\npresents we appoint, Juan de Montiende as fiscal in your tribunal.\"[731]\r\n\r\nIf he thus controlled appointments he was equally concerned in\r\ndismissals. We find him writing, April 22, 1498, to an inquisitor of\r\nSaragossa, who had discharged an official at Calatayud, to reinstate\r\nhim, as he had done good service with danger to his person, and on\r\nSeptember 19, 1509, ordering Diego López de Cortegano, Inquisitor of\r\nCórdova, to cease his functions at once and return to his\r\nbenefice--though this latter order was countersigned by the members of\r\nthe Suprema.[732] It would be superfluous to adduce additional examples\r\nof the control thus exercised over the personnel of the Inquisition--a\r\ncontrol which remained inherent in the crown although, as we shall see,\r\noften allowed to become dormant.\r\n\r\nIn all save spiritual matters, Ferdinand considered the Inquisition to\r\nbe merely an instrument to carry out his will, though it must be added\r\nthat this arose from his anxiety that it should be perfected in every\r\nway for the work in hand, and there is absolutely no evidence, in his\r\nenormous and confidential correspondence, that he ever used it for\r\npolitical purposes, even in the stormiest times when struggling with\r\nunruly nobles. Every detail in its organization and working was subject\r\nto his supervision and, amid all the cares of his tortuous policy,\r\nextending throughout Western Europe, and the excitement of his frequent\r\nwars, he devoted the minutest care to its affairs. When, in December\r\n1484, Torquemada issued his supplementary instructions, he was careful\r\nto state that he did so by command of the sovereigns, who ordered them\r\nto be observed. So in subsequent instructions, issued in 1485,\r\nTorquemada orders the inquisitors to write to him and to Ferdinand about\r\neverything that should be reported; the king provides their salaries\r\npromises them rewards; if there is anything that the king ought to\r\nremedy he is to be written to.[733] That, in fact, the was recognized as\r\ncontrolling the Inquisition is seen in all the efforts of the Córtes,\r\nappealing to him to obtain a modification of its rigors, although, as we\r\nhave seen, the Concordia of 1512 was held to require the assent of\r\nInquisitor-general Enguera to render it binding, with subsequent\r\nconfirmation by the pope and though, in later times, the monarchs found\r\nit convenient to throw upon the inquisitor-general the responsibility of\r\nrejecting the demands of their subjects.\r\n\r\nFerdinand was too self-reliant to deem it necessary to assert his power\r\nconsistently on all occasions. In a subsequent chapter we shall see that\r\nhe submitted to the inconveniences arising from an excommunication\r\nthreatened by Torquemada on receivers of confiscations who honored royal\r\ndrafts in preference to paying salaries. He had no scruples in making\r\nTorquemada join with him in grants of money or in settling competing\r\nclaims on the debts due to a condemned heretic; he sometimes allowed his\r\ncédulas to be countersigned by members of the Suprema, especially in the\r\nlater periods; indeed, toward the end of his reign, this became so\r\nhabitual that in letters of November 25th and December 10, 1515, he\r\nexplained that his orders were to be obeyed although not so\r\nauthenticated, because none of the members happened to be at hand; he\r\nsometimes delayed answering applications for instructions until he could\r\nconsult the inquisitor-general, but the mere application to him shows\r\nthat he was regarded as the ultimate arbiter. In fact, in a case in\r\nwhich some prisoners named Martínez had appealed to him, he replies to\r\nthe inquisitors, September 30, 1498, and March 2, 1499, that the\r\ninquisitors-general send instructions and it is his will that these\r\nshould be executed, thus implying that his confirmation was\r\nrequisite.[734]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FERDINAND'S CONTROL_]\r\n\r\nWhatever participation he might thus allow to the head of the\r\nInquisition, when he saw fit he asserted his arbitrary control and he by\r\nno means deemed it necessary to communicate with the tribunals through\r\nthe inquisitor-general but frequently issued his commands directly. May\r\n14, 1499, he writes to an inquisitor to have a certain confiscated\r\nproperty sold at an appraised value to Diego de Alcocer, no matter what\r\ninstructions he may have from the inquisitors-general or what orders to\r\nthe contrary. Even for trifles he took them sharply to task, as when,\r\nMay 17, 1511, he vigorously rebuked one for sending Bachiller Vazquez to\r\nhim on an affair which could have been as well settled by letter with\r\nmuch less expense. He was fully aware that the power of the Inquisition\r\nrested on his support and when there was the slightest opposition to his\r\nwill he had no hesitation in saying so, as when, in a letter of July 22,\r\n1486, to the inquisitors of Saragossa, he tells them that, although they\r\nhave the name, it is to him and to Isabella that the Holy Office owes\r\nits efficiency; without the royal authority they can do little and, as\r\nthey recognize his good intentions, they must not interfere with his\r\norders.[735]\r\n\r\nThese instances illustrate the minute and watchful care which he\r\nexercised over all the details of the Holy Office. Nothing was too\r\ntrivial to escape his vigilant attention, and this close supervision was\r\ncontinued to the end. The receiver of Valencia consults him about a\r\ncarpenter's bill of ninety sueldos for repairs on the royal palace\r\noccupied by the tribunal and Ferdinand tells him, May 31, 1515, that he\r\nmay pay it this time, but it is not to be a precedent. On January 18th\r\nof the same year he had written to the receiver of Jaen that he learns\r\nthat the audience-chamber is ill-furnished and that the vestments for\r\nmass are lacking or worn out, wherefore he orders that what the\r\ninquisitors may purchase shall be paid for.[736]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFerdinand's control over the Inquisition rested not only on the royal\r\nauthority, the power of appointment, his own force of character and his\r\nintense interest in its workings, but also on the fact that he held the\r\npurse-strings. He had insisted that the confiscations should enure to\r\nthe crown, and he subsequently obtained the pecuniary penances. The\r\nInquisition had no endowment. One could easily have been provided out of\r\nthe immense sums gathered from the victims during the early years of\r\nintense activity but, although some slender provision of the kind was at\r\ntimes attempted, either the chronic demands of the royal treasury or a\r\nprudent desire to prevent the independence of the institution rendered\r\nthese investments fragmentary and wholly inadequate. Thus the expenses\r\nof the tribunals and the salaries of the officials were in his hands.\r\nNothing could be paid without his authorization and the accounts of the\r\nreceivers of confiscations, who acted as treasurers, were scrutinized\r\nwith rigid care. He regulated the salary of every official and his\r\nletter-books are full of instructions as to their payment. Besides this,\r\nit was the Spanish custom to supplement inadequate wages with _ayudas de\r\ncosta_, or gifts of greater or less amount as the whim of the sovereign\r\nor the deserts of the individual might call for. In time, as we shall\r\nsee, this became a regular annual payment, subject to certain conditions\r\nbut, under Ferdinand, it was still an uncertainty, dependent upon the\r\nroyal favor and the order of the king was requisite in each case, even\r\nincluding the Suprema and its officials.[737] The crown thus held the\r\nHoly Office at its mercy and the recipients of its bounty could not\r\nresent its control.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INDEPENDENCE IN MATTERS OF FAITH_]\r\n\r\nYet in this perpetual activity of Ferdinand in the affairs of the\r\nInquisition it is to be observed that he confined himself to temporal\r\nmatters and abstained from interference with its spiritual jurisdiction.\r\nIn his voluminous correspondence, extending, with occasional breaks,\r\nover many years, the exceptions to this only serve to prove the rule. I\r\nhave met with but two and these fully justified his interference. In\r\n1508 the leading barons of Aragon complained that the inquisitors were\r\npersecuting the Moors and were endeavoring to coerce them to baptism. As\r\nthey had no jurisdiction over infidels, he rebuked them severely,\r\ntelling them that conversion through conviction is alone pleasing to God\r\nand that no one is to be baptized except on voluntary application. So,\r\nwhen some had been converted and had been abandoned by their wives and\r\nchildren, he ordered the inquisitors to permit the return of the latter\r\nand not to coerce them to baptism.[738] The other case was that of Pedro\r\nde Villacis, receiver of Seville, a man who possessed Ferdinand's\r\nfullest confidence. No name occurs more frequently in the correspondence\r\nand he was entrusted with the management of an enormous and most\r\ncomplicated composition, in which the New Christians of Seville,\r\nCórdova, Leon, Granada and Jaen agreed to pay eighty thousand ducats as\r\nan assurance against confiscation. While deeply immersed in this the\r\ntribunal of Seville commenced to take testimony against him. On hearing\r\nof this Ferdinand was astounded; he expressed indignation that such\r\naction should be taken without consulting him and ordered all the\r\noriginal papers to be sent to him for consideration with the Suprema,\r\npending which and future orders nothing further was to be done.[739]\r\n\r\nThis was an extreme case. There are others which prove how useless it\r\nwas to rely upon the royal favor in hopes of interposition. Thus\r\nFerdinand's vice-chancellor for Aragon was Alonso de la Caballería, a\r\nson of that Bernabos de la Caballería whose _Çelo de Cristo contra los\r\nJudíos_ has been referred to above (p. 115). The father's orthodox zeal\r\ndid not preserve his children from the Inquisition and their names and\r\nthose of their kindred frequently occur in the records. Alonso had\r\nalready passed through its hands without losing his position. In\r\nDecember, 1502, his brother Jaime was arrested by the tribunal of\r\nSaragossa, and Alonso ventured to ask Ferdinand's intervention in his\r\nfavor and also for himself in case he should be involved and be\r\nsubjected to another trial. Ferdinand replied, December 23d, expressing\r\nregret and the hope that all would turn out as he desired; if Alonso's\r\ncase comes up again he shall be tried by Deza himself who can be relied\r\nupon to do exact justice. A second application from Alonso brought a\r\nreply, January 3, 1503, reiterating these assurances and promising a\r\nspeedy trial for his brother, about whom he writes to the inquisitors.\r\nIn effect, a letter to them of the same day alludes, among other\r\nmatters, to Jaime's case, with the customary injunctions to conduct it\r\njustly so as not to injure the Inquisition and assuring them that if\r\nthey do so they shall not be interfered with. How little the appeal to\r\nFerdinand benefited the accused is seen in the result that Jaime was\r\npenanced in an auto de fe of March 25, 1504.[740]\r\n\r\nIn one respect Ferdinand showed favoritism, but he did so in a manner\r\nproving that he recognized that the royal power could not of itself\r\ninterfere with the exercise of inquisitorial jurisdiction.\r\nNotwithstanding his settled aversion to papal intervention, he procured\r\na series of curious briefs to spare those whom he favored from the\r\ndisgrace of public reconciliation and penance and their descendants\r\nfrom disabilities. So many of his trusted officials were of Jewish\r\nlineage that he might well seek to shield them and to retain their\r\nservices. Thus, in briefs of February 11, 1484, and January 30, 1485,\r\nInnocent VIII recites that he is informed that some of those involved in\r\nthis heresy would gladly return to the faith and abjure if they could be\r\nsecretly reconciled, wherefore he confers on the inquisitors faculties,\r\nin conjunction with episcopal representatives, to receive secretly, in\r\nthe presence of Ferdinand and Isabella, fifty persons of this kind to\r\nabjuration and reconciliation. A subsequent brief of May 31, 1486,\r\nrecites that he learns that the sovereigns cannot always be present on\r\nthese occasions, wherefore he grants for fifty more similar power to be\r\nexercised in their absence but with their consent. Then, July 5, 1486,\r\nthe same is granted for fifty more, even if testimony has been taken\r\nagainst them, with the addition of the removal of disabilities and the\r\nstain of infamy in favor of their children and moreover it authorizes\r\nthe secret exhumation and burning of fifty bodies--doubtless the parents\r\nof those thus favored. These transactions continued, for there are\r\nsimilar letters of November 10, 1487, and October 14, 1489, each for\r\nfifty persons and fifty bodies, to be nominated by the king and queen,\r\nand possibly there were subsequent ones that have not reached us.[741]\r\nIt was doubtless under letters of this kind that, on January 10, 1489,\r\nElionor and Isabel Badorch were secretly reconciled in the royal palace\r\nof Barcelona.[742]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INSISTENCE ON JUSTICE_]\r\n\r\nThese apparently trivial details are of interest as revealing the basis\r\non which the Inquisition was established and from which it developed.\r\nThey also throw light on the character of Ferdinand, whose restless and\r\nincessant activity made itself felt in every department of the\r\ngovernment, enabling his resolute will to break down the forces of\r\nfeudalism and lay the foundation of absolute monarchy for his\r\nsuccessors. It would be doing him an injustice, however, to dismiss the\r\nsubject without alluding to his anxiety that the Inquisition should be\r\nkept strictly within the lines of absolute justice according to the\r\nstandard of the period. Trained in the accepted doctrine of the Church\r\nthat heresy was the greatest of crimes, that the heretic had no rights\r\nand that it was a service to God to torture him to death, he was\r\npitiless and he stimulated the inquisitors to incessant vigilance. He\r\nwas no less eager in gathering in every shred of spoil which he could\r\nlawfully claim from the confiscation of the victims, but, in the\r\ndistorted ethics of the time, this comported with the strictest equity,\r\nfor it was obedience to the canon law which was the expression of the\r\nlaw of God. There can have been no hypocrisy in his constant\r\ninstructions to inquisitors and receivers of confiscations to perform\r\ntheir functions with rectitude and moderation so that no one should have\r\ncause to complain. This was his general formula to new appointees and is\r\nborne out by his instructions in the innumerable special cases where\r\nappeal was made to him against real or fancied injustice. His abstinence\r\nfrom intrusion into matters of faith limited such appeals to financial\r\nquestions, but these, under the cruel canonical regulations as to\r\nconfiscations, were often highly complicated and involved the rights of\r\ninnocent third parties. His decisions in such cases are often adverse to\r\nhimself and reveal an innate sense of justice wholly unexpected in a\r\nmonarch who ranked next to Cesar Borgia in the estimation of\r\nMachiavelli. An instance or two, taken at random out of many, will\r\nillustrate this phase of his character. July 11, 1486, he writes to his\r\nreceiver at Saragossa \"Fifteen years ago, Jaime de Santangel, recently\r\nburnt, possessed a piece of land in Saragossa and did not pay the\r\nground-rent on it to García Martinez. By the fuero of Aragon, when such\r\nrent is unpaid for four years the land is forfeited. You are said to\r\nhold the land as part of the confiscated estate of Santangel and for the\r\nabove reason it is said to belong to Martínez. You are therefore ordered\r\nto see what is justice and do it to Martínez without delay and if you\r\nhave sold the land, the matter must be put into such shape that Martínez\r\nmay obtain what is due.\" In a similar spirit, when Caspar Roig, of\r\nCagliari, deemed himself aggrieved in a transaction arising out of a\r\ncomposition for confiscation, Ferdinand writes to the inquisitor of\r\nSardinia, March 11, 1498, \"As it is our will that no one shall suffer\r\ninjustice, we refer the case to you, charging you at once to hear the\r\nparties and do what is just, so that the said Gaspar Roig shall suffer\r\nno wrong.... You will see that the said Gaspar Roig shall not again have\r\nto appeal to us for default of justice.\"[743]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that, when this powerful personality was withdrawn,\r\nthe royal control over the Inquisition should diminish, especially in\r\nview of the inability of Queen Juana to govern and the absence of the\r\nyouthful Charles V. The government of Spain practically devolved upon\r\nXimenes, who was Inquisitor-general of Castile, while his coadjutor\r\nAdrian speedily obtained the same post in Aragon. After the arrival of\r\nCharles and the death of Ximenes, Adrian became chief of the reunited\r\nInquisition and his influence over Charles in all matters connected with\r\nit was unbounded. The circumstances therefore were peculiarly propitious\r\nfor the development of its practical independence, although\r\ntheoretically the supremacy of the crown remained unaltered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _POWER OF APPOINTMENT_]\r\n\r\nThus the Suprema, of which we hear little under Ferdinand, at once\r\nassumed his place in regulating all details. The appointing power, even\r\nof receivers, who were secular officials, accountable only to the royal\r\ntreasury, passed into its hands. Thus a letter of Ximenes, March 11,\r\n1517, to the receiver of Toledo, states that there are large amounts of\r\nuncollected confiscations, wherefore he is directed to select a proper\r\nperson for an assistant and send him to the Suprema to decide as to his\r\nfitness, so that Ximenes may appoint him with its approval.[744] Still,\r\nthe nominating power remained technically with the crown and, when\r\nCharles arrived, he was assumed to exercise it as Ferdinand had done,\r\nhowever little real volition he may have displayed. In a letter of\r\nDecember 11, 1518, concerning the appointment of Andrés Sánchez de\r\nTorquemada as Inquisitor of Seville, Charles is made to say that, being\r\nsatisfied of Torquemada's capacity, he had charged him to accept the\r\noffice and that with his assent Adrian had appointed him. In another\r\ncase, where an abbot, to whom Adrian had offered the inquisitorship of\r\nToledo, had declined the office, Charles writes, September 14, 1519,\r\ncharging him to accept it.[745] That Adrian could not act alone was\r\nrecognized for, after Charles left Spain, in May, 1520, questions arose\r\non the subject and, by letters patent of September 12th, he formally\r\nempowered Adrian, during his absence, to appoint all inquisitors and\r\nother officials.[746]\r\n\r\nWhether formal delegations of the appointing power were subsequently\r\nmade does not appear, but practically it continued with the\r\ninquisitor-general, subject to an uncertain co-operation of the Suprema,\r\nwhose members countersigned the commissions, while, with the subordinate\r\npositions in the tribunals, the inquisitors were sometimes consulted,\r\ntheir recommendations received attention and their remonstrances were\r\nheard. The various factors are illustrated in a letter of the Suprema,\r\nAugust 24, 1544, to the inquisitors of Saragossa who had furnished a\r\nstatement of the qualifications of various aspirants for the vacant post\r\nof _notario del juzgado_. In reply the Suprema states that its\r\nsecretary, Hieronimo Zurita, had recommended Martin Morales; it had\r\nadvised with the inquisitor-general who had appointed him, but it will\r\nbear in mind Bartolomé Malo and will give him something else.[747]\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware, Philip II never interfered with this exercise of\r\nthe appointing power. That he threw the whole responsibility on the\r\ninquisitor-general and disclaimed any concurrence for himself is\r\napparent in a series of instructions, May 8, 1595, to the new\r\ninquisitor-general, Geronimo Manrique. He orders him to observe the\r\nutmost care to select fit persons for all positions without favoritism\r\nand, although it is his duty to appoint inquisitors and fiscals, he\r\nshould communicate his selections in advance to the Suprema, as his\r\npredecessors had always done, because some of the members may be\r\nacquainted with the parties and prevent errors from being made.[748]\r\nThat a supervisory power, however, was still recognized in the crown is\r\nseen in a consulta of June 21, 1600, presented to Philip III, by\r\nInquisitor-general Guevara, lamenting the unfitness of many of the\r\ninquisitors. With the habitual tenderness manifested to unworthy\r\nofficials he did not propose to dismiss them but to make a general\r\nshifting by which the best men should be made the seniors of the\r\ntribunals. To this the king replied with a caution about discrediting\r\nthe Inquisition and a suggestion that the parties shifted should be made\r\nto ask for the change; he also called for their names and the reasons,\r\nbecause he ought to be informed about all the individuals.[749]\r\n\r\nThis indicated a desire to resume the close watchfulness of Ferdinand\r\nwhich had long since been forgotten in the turmoil and absences of\r\nCharles V and the secluded labors of Philip II, over despatches and\r\nconsultas. A bureaucracy was establishing itself in which the various\r\ndepartments of the government were becoming more or less independent of\r\nthe monarch and Philip for the moment appeared disposed to reassert his\r\nauthority, for, in 1603, we are told that he made many appointments of\r\ninquisitors, fiscals, and even of minor officials.[750] If so, he was\r\ntoo irresolute, feeble, and fitful to carry out a definite line of\r\npolicy for when, in 1608, he issued the customary instructions to a new\r\ninquisitor, Sandoval y Rójas, he merely repeated the injunctions of\r\n1595, with the addition that transfers should also be communicated to\r\nthe Suprema.[751] Yet in one case he even exceeded Ferdinand by\r\nintervening in a case of faith. When he went to Toledo with his court to\r\nwitness the auto de fe of May 10, 1615, he asked to see the sentence of\r\nJuan Cote, penanced for Lutheranism, and made some changes in the\r\n_meritos_, or recital of offences, altered the imprisonment to perpetual\r\nand irremissible and added two hundred lashes. The tribunal consulted\r\nthe Suprema, which approved the changes on the supposition that the\r\ninquisitor-general had participated in them, but the day after the auto\r\nCote was informed that the Suprema had mercifully remitted the\r\nscourging.[752]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _POWER OF APPOINTMENT_]\r\n\r\nPhilip IV, in 1626, on the death of Inquisitor-general Pacheco, asked\r\nthe Suprema to suggest the instructions to be given to the new incumbent\r\nand was advised to repeat those of 1608. He virtually admitted the power\r\nof appointment to be vested in that office when, in the same year, the\r\nCórtes of Barbastro petitioned that in Aragon all the officials of the\r\ntribunals should be Aragonese and he replied that he would use his\r\nauthority with the inquisitor-general that a certain portion of them\r\nshould be so.[753] Notwithstanding his habitual subservience to the\r\nInquisition, however, he reasserted his prerogative, in 1640, by\r\nappointing the Archdeacon of Vich as Inquisitor of Barcelona and he\r\nfollowed this, in 1641 and 1642, by several others, even descending to\r\nthe secretaryship of Lima which he gave to Domingo de Aroche.[754] This\r\nbrought on a struggle, ending in a compromise in which the\r\ninquisitor-general was sacrificed to the Suprema. Papal intervention was\r\ndeemed to be necessary and a brief was procured in March, 1643, under\r\nwhich Philip, by decree of July 2, ordered that in future, in all\r\nvacancies of positions of inquisitor and fiscal, the inquisitor-general\r\nand Suprema should submit to him three names from which to make\r\nselection. The Suprema thus recognized was satisfied, but Sotomayor, the\r\ninquisitor-general, was obstinate. In June, Philip had called for his\r\nresignation, which he offered after some hesitation and expressed his\r\nfeelings in a protest presenting a sorry picture of the condition of the\r\nHoly Office. The present disorders, he said, had arisen from the\r\nmultiplication of offices, whereby their character had depreciated and,\r\nas the revenues were insufficient for their support, they were led to\r\nimproper devices. The Suprema had been powerless for, on various\r\noccasions, the king had rewarded services in other fields by the gifts\r\nof these offices, when no consideration could be given to character, and\r\nhe had also been forced to make appointments by commands as imperative\r\nas those of the king--an evident allusion to Olivares.[755]\r\n\r\nSotomayor's successor, Arce y Reynoso, conformed himself to these new\r\nrules and, until his death in 1665, he submitted all appointments and\r\ntransfers to the king. Philip survived him but three months and, under\r\nthe regency which followed and the reign of the imbecile Carlos II, the\r\ninquisitor-general resumed the power of appointment without\r\nconsultation. So completely was the royal supervision forgotten that the\r\ninstructions to Inquisitor-general Rocaberti, in 1695, repeat the old\r\nformula of 1608.[756] In this, the injunction of consulting the Suprema\r\nwas displeasing to the Holy See, after its intervention in the affair of\r\nFroilan Díaz (of which more hereafter) had caused it to take sides in\r\nthe quarrel over the respective powers of the inquisitor-general and the\r\nSuprema. As the commission of the former was a papal grant, it held that\r\nno restriction could be placed on him and, when Vidal Marin was\r\nappointed, Clement XI sent to him August 8, 1705, urgent instructions to\r\nuphold the dignity of his office which had exclusive authority in the\r\npremises.[757]\r\n\r\nThe command was too agreeable not to be obeyed and, from this time, the\r\nunrestricted power of appointment was in the hands of the\r\ninquisitor-general. About 1765, a writer tells us that all salaried\r\noffices were filled by him alone. If the king wished to gratify some one\r\nwith a position he would signify his desire to the inquisitor-general\r\nthat such person should be borne in mind at the first vacancy and the\r\nroyal wish was respected, in the absence of special objection. If such\r\nthere were it was reported to the king and his decision was\r\nawaited.[758] With the tendency to assert the prerogative, under Carlos\r\nIII, this was called in question, in 1775, when the royal Camara\r\nscrutinized the brief commissioning Felipe Bertran as\r\ninquisitor-general, but the protest was merely formal; the appointing\r\npower remained undisturbed; it survived the Revolution and continued\r\nuntil the Inquisition was suppressed.[759]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITOR-GENERALSHIP_]\r\n\r\nOf vastly greater importance was the power of selecting and virtually\r\ndismissing the inquisitor-general and this the crown never lost. In fact\r\nthis was essential to its dignity, if not to its safety. Had the\r\nappointment rested with the pope, either the Inquisition would of\r\nnecessity have been reduced to insignificance or the kingdom would have\r\nbecome a dependency of the curia. Had the Suprema possessed the power of\r\npresenting a nominee to the pope, the Inquisition would have become an\r\nindependent body rivalling and perhaps in time superseding the monarchy.\r\nYet, after the death of Ferdinand, Cardinal Adrian, when elected to the\r\npapacy, seemed to imagine that Ferdinand's privilege of nomination had\r\nbeen merely personal and that it had reverted to him. February 19, 1522,\r\nhe wrote to Charles that a successor must be provided; after much\r\nthought he had pitched on the Dominican General but had not determined\r\nto make the appointment without first learning Charles's wishes. If the\r\nDominican was not satisfactory, Charles could name some one else, for\r\nwhich purpose he suggested three other prelates. Charles replied from\r\nBrussels, March 29th, assuming the appointment to be in his hands, but\r\nordered his representative Lachaulx to confer with Adrian. He was in no\r\nhaste to reach a decision and it was not until July 13, 1523, that he\r\ninstructed his ambassador, the Duke of Sessa, to ask the commission for\r\nAlfonso Manrique, Bishop of Córdova, on whom he had conferred the post\r\nof inquisitor-general and the archbishopric of Seville.[760]\r\n\r\nThe records afford no indication of any question subsequently arising as\r\nto the power of the crown to select the inquisitor-general. It was\r\nnever, however, officially recognized by the popes, whose commissions to\r\nthe successive nominees bore the form of a _motu proprio_--the\r\nspontaneous act of the Holy See--by which, without reference to any\r\nrequest from the sovereign, the recipient was created inquisitor-general\r\nof the Spanish dominions and was invested with all the faculties and\r\npowers requisite for the functions of his office.[761] No objection\r\nseems to have been taken to this until Carlos III exercised a jealous\r\ncare over the assertion and maintenance of the regalías against the\r\nassumptions of the curia. The first appointment he had occasion to make\r\nwas that of Felipe Bertran, Bishop of Salamanca, after the death of\r\nInquisitor-general Bonifaz. December 27, 1774, was despatched the\r\napplication to the papacy for the commission, carefully framed to avoid\r\nattributing to the latter any share in the selection or appointment and\r\nmerely asking for a delegation of faculties, accompanied with\r\ninstructions to the ambassador Floridablanca to procure for Bertran a\r\ndispensation from residence at his see during his term of office.\r\nClement XIV had died, September 22, 1774, and the intrigues arising from\r\nthe suppression of the Jesuits delayed the election of Pius VI until\r\nFebruary 15, 1775, but on February 27th the commission and dispensation\r\nwere signed. March 25th, Carlos sent the commission to the royal Camara\r\nfor examination before its delivery to Bertran and the Camara reported,\r\nApril 24th, that its fiscal pronounced it similar to that granted to\r\nBonifaz in 1755, but that it did not express as it should the royal\r\nnomination and had the form of a _motu proprio_; he also objected to its\r\ngranting the power of appointment and further that some of the faculties\r\nincluded infringed on the royal and episcopal jurisdictions, while the\r\nclauses on censorship conflicted with the royal decrees. Under these\r\nreserves the brief was ordered to be delivered to Bertran; whether or\r\nnot a protest was made to the curia does not appear, but if it was it\r\nwas ineffective for the same formula was used in the commission issued\r\nto Inquisitor-general Agustin Rubin de Cevallos, February 17, 1784.[762]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITOR-GENERALSHIP_]\r\n\r\nIt may be assumed as a matter of course that the king had no power to\r\ndismiss an inquisitor-general who held his commission at the pleasure of\r\nthe pope, but the sovereign had usually abundant means of enforcing a\r\nresignation. Whether that of Alfonso Suárez de Fuentelsaz, in 1504, was\r\nvoluntary or coerced is not known, but the case of Cardinal Manrique,\r\nthe successor of Adrian, shows that if an inquisitor-general was not\r\nforced to resign he could be virtually shelved. Manrique, as Bishop of\r\nBadajoz, after Isabella's death, had so actively supported the claims of\r\nPhilip I that Ferdinand ordered his arrest; he fled to Flanders, where\r\nhe entered Charles's service and returned with him to Spain, obtaining\r\nthe see of Córdova and ultimately the archbishopric of Seville.[763]\r\nPerhaps he incurred the ill-will of the Empress Isabella soon after his\r\nappointment, for we find him complaining, January 23, 1524, to Charles\r\nthat when in Valencia she had ordered the disarmament of the familiars\r\nand the arrest of Micer Artes, a salaried official of the Inquisition,\r\nviolations of its privileges for which he asked a remedy.[764] In 1529,\r\nhe gave more serious cause of offence. When Charles sailed, July 28th,\r\nto Italy for his coronation, he placed under charge of the empress Doña\r\nLuisa de Acuña, heiress of the Count of Valencia, until her marriage\r\nshould be determined. There were three suitors--Manrique's cousin the\r\nCount of Treviño, heir apparent of the Duke of Najera, the Marquis of\r\nAstorga and the Marquis of Mayorga. The empress placed her ward in the\r\nconvent of San Domingo el Real of Toledo, where Manrique abused his\r\nauthority by introducing his cousin; an altar had been prepared in\r\nadvance and the marriage was celebrated on the spot. The empress, justly\r\nincensed, ordered him from the court to his see until the emperor should\r\nreturn and turned a deaf ear to the representations by the Suprema,\r\nDecember 12th, of the interference with the holy work of the Inquisition\r\nand the discredit cast upon it. It was probably to this that may be\r\nreferred the delay in his elevation to the cardinalate, announced March\r\n22, 1531, after being kept _in petto_ since December 19, 1529. On\r\nCharles's return, in 1533, he was allowed to take his place again, but\r\nhe fell into disgrace once more in 1534, when he was sent back to his\r\nsee where he died at an advanced age in 1538. Still, this was not\r\nequivalent to dismissal; he continued to exercise his functions and his\r\nsignature is appended to documents of the Inquisition at least until\r\n1537.[765] Yet while thus dealing with the inquisitor-general the crown\r\ncould exercise no control over the tribunals. The empress was interested\r\nin the case of Fray Francisco Ortiz, arrested April 6, 1529, by the\r\ntribunal of Toledo, and she twice requested the expediting of his trial\r\nfor which, October 27, 1530, she alleged reasons of state, but the\r\ntribunal was deaf to her wishes as well as to those of Clement VII who\r\ninterposed July 1, 1531, and the sentence was not rendered until April\r\n17, 1532.[766]\r\n\r\nThere was no occasion for royal interference with Inquisitors-general\r\nTavera, Loaysa or Valdés. If the latter was forced to resign, in 1566,\r\nit was not by order of Philip II but of Pius V for his part, as we shall\r\nsee hereafter, in the prosecution of Carranza, Archbishop of Toledo. So\r\nif Espinosa, in 1572, died in consequence of a reproof from Philip II,\r\nit was not for official misconduct and merely shows the depth of\r\nservility attainable by the courtiers of the period. The reign of the\r\nfeeble Philip III however afforded several instances that the royal will\r\nsufficed to create a vacancy. He had scarce mounted on the throne as a\r\nyouth of twenty, on the death of Philip II, September 13, 1598, before\r\nhe sought to get rid of Inquisitor-general Portocarrero, who had, it is\r\nsaid, spoken lightly of him, or had incurred the ill-will of the\r\nfavorite, the Duke of Lerma. To effect this, a bull was procured from\r\nClement VIII requiring episcopal residence; Portocarrero was Bishop of\r\nCuenca, a see reputed to be worth forty thousand ducats a year, but he\r\npreferred to abandon this and made fruitless efforts at Rome to be\r\npermitted to do so. He left Madrid in September, 1599, for Cuenca and\r\ndied of grief within a twelve-month, refusing to make a will because, as\r\nhe said, he had nothing to leave but debts that would take two years'\r\nrevenue of his see to pay.[767] His successor, Cardinal Fernando Niño de\r\nGuevara fared no better. He was in Rome at the time of his appointment\r\nand did not take possession of his office until December 23, 1599, but\r\nalready in May, 1600, there were rumors that he was to be superseded by\r\nSandoval y Rojas, Archbishop of Toledo. Yet, in 1601, he was made\r\nArchbishop of Seville and he sought to purchase Philip's favor by a gift\r\nof forty thousand ducats and nearly all his plate. This was unavailing\r\nand, in January, 1602, he was ordered to reside in his see, when he\r\ndutifully handed in his resignation.[768] Juan de Zuñiga, who succeeded,\r\nhad a clause in his commission permitting him to resign the\r\nadministration of his see in the hands of the pope, but the precaution\r\nwas superfluous for he died, December 20, 1602, after only six weeks'\r\nenjoyment of the office, for which he had sacrificed thirty thousand\r\nducats a year from his see. He was old and feeble and his death was\r\nattributed to his coming in winter from a warm climate to the rigors of\r\nValladolid, then the residence of the court.[769]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITOR-GENERALSHIP_]\r\n\r\nThe question of non-residence was happily solved, for a time at least,\r\nby selecting as the next incumbent Juan Bautista de Azevedo, Bishop of\r\nValladolid, the seat of the court. He was a person of so little\r\nconsequence that the appointment aroused general surprise until it was\r\nrecalled that he had been a secretary of Lerma. When the court removed\r\nto Madrid, in 1606, he was obliged to choose between the two dignities\r\nand his resignation of the bishopric was facilitated by granting him a\r\npension of twelve thousand ducats on the treasury of the Indies, besides\r\nwhich, as Patriarch of the Indies, he had a salary of eight\r\nthousand.[770] His death soon followed, in 1608, when Sandoval y Rojas,\r\nthe uncle of Lerma, obtained the position without sacrificing his\r\nprimatial see of Toledo, a dispensation for non-residence being\r\ndoubtless easily obtained by such a personage.\r\n\r\nSandoval was succeeded, in 1619, by Fray Luis de Aliaga, a Dominican who\r\nhad been Lerma's confessor. In 1608 Lerma transferred him to the king,\r\nover whom his influence steadily increased, although his doubtful\r\nreputation is inferable from the popular attribution to him of the\r\nspurious continuation of Don Quixote, published in 1614 under the name\r\nof Avellaneda--a work of which the buffoonery and indecency are most\r\nunclerical.[771] Though he owed his fortune to Lerma, he joined, in\r\n1618, in causing his patron's downfall in favor of Lerma's nephew, the\r\nDuke of Uceda, and during the rest of Philip's reign Uceda and Aliaga\r\nvirtually ruled and misgoverned the land, filling the offices with their\r\ncreatures, selling justice and intensifying the financial disorders\r\nwhich were bringing Spain to its ruin. When Philip IV succeeded to the\r\nthrone, March 31, 1621, under tutelage to his favorite Olivares, their\r\nfirst business was to dismiss all who had been in power under the late\r\nking. The secular officials were easily disposed of, but the papal\r\ncommission of the inquisitor-general rendered him independent of the\r\nking; he did not manifest the accommodating disposition of Portocarrero\r\nand Guevara and, as he was not a bishop, he could not be ordered to his\r\nsee. It illustrates the anomalous position of the Inquisition, as part\r\nof an absolute government, that for some weeks the question of his\r\nremoval was the subject of repeated juntas and consultations, but\r\nfinally, April 23d, Philip wrote, ordering him to leave the court within\r\ntwenty-four hours, for the Dominican Convent of Huete, where his\r\nsuperior would give him further instructions. He obeyed, but he refused\r\nthe bishopric of Zamora and the continuance of his ecclesiastical\r\nrevenues as the price of his resignation. The only method left was to\r\nobtain from Gregory XV the withdrawal of his delegated powers by\r\nrepresenting his unworthiness, his guilty complicity with Uceda and\r\nOsuna and Philip III's reproach to him on his death-bed for misguiding\r\nhis soul to perdition. Gregory listened favorably and Aliaga seems to\r\nhave recognized the untenableness of his position and to have resigned,\r\nalthough no evidence of it exists. All we know is that Andrés Pacheco,\r\nBishop of Cuenca, was appointed as his successor in February, 1622, and\r\ntook possession of the office in April. Even after this Aliaga was an\r\nobject of apprehension. In June, 1623, he came to Hortaleza, which was\r\nwithin a league or two of Madrid. Immediately the court was in a\r\nflutter; the king held earnest consultations; his propinquity was\r\nregarded as dangerous and he could not be allowed to return, as he had\r\nasked, to his native Aragon, which was in a chronically inflammable\r\ncondition, while in Valencia his brother was archbishop; nor could he be\r\nallowed to leave the kingdom, possessing as he did so intimate a\r\nknowledge of state secrets. There were messages and active\r\ncorrespondence and finally he was allowed to settle in Guadalajara with\r\nample means, where his remaining three years of life passed in\r\nobscurity. Llorente tells us that proceedings were commenced against him\r\nfor propositions savoring of Lutheranism and materialism, which were\r\ndiscontinued after his death, a device doubtless adopted to keep him in\r\nretirement.[772]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITOR-GENERALSHIP_]\r\n\r\nAndrés Pacheco, who succeeded him in 1622, prudently resigned his see of\r\nCuenca and, in spite of his audacious enforcement of inquisitorial\r\nclaims, was allowed to hold the office until his death, April 7,\r\n1626.[773] There was no haste in filling the vacancy, for it was not\r\nuntil August 6th that Olivares replied to the king's order to report in\r\nwriting the best persons to fill the office. He named four, covertly\r\nindicating his preference for Cardinal Zapata, who had resigned the\r\narchbishopric of Burgos in 1605 and at the time was governor of that of\r\nToledo. Philip followed the suggestion by an endorsement on the paper,\r\nwhich was a singularly informal appointment, remarking at the same time\r\nthat the choice should not be made public until his successor at Toledo\r\nwas selected.[774] His resignation of the office, in 1632, is commonly\r\nattributed to a request from the king, but this is by no means certain.\r\nHe was more than eighty years of age and for some time had been talking\r\nof resigning; already in 1630 the Suprema alludes in a consulta to the\r\npublicity of his intention of relieving himself of the charge. Possibly\r\nat the end some gentle pressure may have been used, but when, September\r\n6, 1632, the commission of his successor arrived, his parting with the\r\nking was in terms of mutual respect and good feeling. His retirement was\r\nsoftened by continuing to him his full salary and perquisites, amounting\r\nto 1,353,625 mrs. (3620 ducats) which, as the Suprema never had enough\r\nrevenue for its desires, was not cordially welcomed.[775]\r\n\r\nHis successor, the Dominican Fray Antonio de Sotomayor, was Archbishop\r\nof Damascus _in partibus_ and confessor of the king. He was already in\r\nhis seventy-seventh year and, when he had held his office for eleven\r\nyears, his infirmities and incapacity became more evident to others than\r\nto himself. Early in 1643 the fall of Olivares deprived him of support,\r\nhis opposition to the king in the matter of appointments still further\r\nweakened his position and in June he was requested to resign in view of\r\nhis advanced age and to preserve his health. He was much disturbed and\r\nconsulted friends, who advised him to obey, but he still held on, saying\r\nthat they might await his death. Greater pressure was applied to which\r\nhe yielded. June 20th he made a formal notarial attestation of his\r\ndesire to be relieved on account of his great age and the next day he\r\nsent in an ungracious resignation, followed, on the 24th by one\r\naddressed to the pope. His successor, Diego de Arce y Reynoso, Bishop\r\nof Plasencia, was already on the spot, exercising some of the\r\nfunctions, but Urban VIII hesitated to confirm the change and required\r\nexplanations. It was not until September 18th that the commission of\r\nArce y Reynoso was expedited and it only reached Madrid November 7th.\r\nSotomayor was \"jubilated\" with half his salary of nine thousand ducats,\r\nwhich he enjoyed for five years longer.[776]\r\n\r\nArce y Reynoso, as we shall see, when embroiled with Rome in the\r\nprosecution of Villanueva, Marquis of Villalva, was obliged to resign\r\nhis see of Plasencia, December 2, 1652, in order to retain his\r\ninquisitor-generalship. He continued in office until his death, June 20,\r\n1665, followed by that of Philip, September 16th. During this interval,\r\nPhilip gave the appointment to Pascual of Aragon, son of the Duke of\r\nCardona and serving at the time as Viceroy of Naples. He promptly sailed\r\nfor Spain and, though he is said to have resigned without acting, there\r\nare documents of October and November, 1665, which show that he\r\nperformed the functions of the office.[777] He obtained the see of\r\nToledo March 7, 1666, and desired to retain the inquisitor-generalship,\r\nbut the Queen-regent, Maria Ana of Austria, compelled him to resign, in\r\norder to fill the place with her confessor and favorite the German\r\nJesuit, Johann Everardt Nithard.[778]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITOR-GENERALSHIP_]\r\n\r\nNithard, in 1668, boasted that he had had charge of the queen's\r\nconscience for twenty-four years, during which she had kept him\r\nconstantly with her. He had thus moulded her character from youth and,\r\nas she was weak and obstinate, he had rendered himself indispensable.\r\nHer selection of him as inquisitor-general provoked lively opposition,\r\nwhich even reverence for royalty could not repress; protests were\r\npresented, leading to prolonged and heated discussion, but resistance\r\nwas in vain.[779] He was appointed October 15, 1666, and speedily became\r\nthe ruler of the kingdom which he misgoverned. The general\r\ndissatisfaction thus aroused was stimulated by the jealousy of the\r\n_frailes_, who had been accustomed to see Dominicans as royal\r\nconfessors and whose hatred of the Company of Jesus was exacerbated by\r\nhis combination of that position with the inquisitor-generalship. He was\r\naccused of filling the Holy Office with Jesuit _calificadores_, under\r\nwhose advice he managed it, and with accumulating for himself pensions\r\namounting to sixty thousand ducats a year. Spain at the time had a\r\npinchbeck hero in the person of the second Don Juan of Austria, son of\r\nPhilip IV by a woman known as la Calderona; he stood high in popular\r\nesteem, for he had the reputation of suppressing the Neapolitan revolt\r\nof 1648 and of ending the Catalan rebellion by the capture of Barcelona\r\nin 1652. Between him and Nithard there inevitably arose hostility which\r\nripened into the bitterest hatred. To get him out of the country, he was\r\ngiven command of an expedition about to sail for Flanders; he went to\r\nCoruña but refused to sail; he was ordered to retire to Consuegra,\r\nwhither a troop of horse was sent to arrest him, but he had fled to\r\nCatalonia, leaving a letter addressed to the queen in which he said that\r\nthe execrable wickedness of Nithard had forced him to provide for his\r\nsafety; his refusal to sail had been caused by his desire to remove from\r\nher side that wild beast, so unworthy of his sacred office; he did not\r\npropose to kill him for he did not wish to plunge into perdition a soul\r\nin such evil state, but he would devote himself to relieving the kingdom\r\nof this basilisk, confident that the queen would recognize the service\r\nthus rendered to the king.\r\n\r\nThis letter and a similar one of November 13th were widely circulated\r\nand inflamed the popular detestation of Nithard. Don Juan stood forward\r\nas the champion of the people against the hated foreigner and continued\r\nto issue inflammatory addresses. Letters came pouring into the court,\r\nfrom the cities represented in the Córtes, praying the queen to accede\r\nto his demands but, though her councillors wavered, she stood firm.\r\nDecember 3d she wrote to him to return to Consuegra or to come near to\r\nMadrid, where negotiations could be carried on. While taking advantage\r\nof this he avoided the trap by writing that, as his life was endangered,\r\nher envoy, the Duke of Osuna, had furnished him with a guard of three\r\ncompanies of horse--about 250 men in all. With this escort he started\r\nfrom Barcelona by way of Saragossa. It was in vain that orders were sent\r\nfrom the court to insult him on the road. Everywhere his journey was\r\nlike a royal progress. Nobles and peoples gathered to applaud him and,\r\nin Saragossa even the tribunal of the Inquisition bore a part, while the\r\nstudents carried around the effigy of a Jesuit and burnt it before the\r\nJesuit house, forcing the rector to witness it from the window.\r\n\r\nAs he drew near to Madrid with his handful of men, Nithard called on the\r\nnobles of his party to assemble with their armed retainers, but the\r\nCouncil of Regency prohibited this. Don Juan was in no haste; on\r\nFebruary 9th he reached Junquera, some ten leagues from Madrid and, on\r\nthe 22d, he was at Torrejon de Ardoz, about five leagues distant.\r\nImminent danger was felt that if he advanced the populace would rise and\r\nmurder the ministers to whom they attributed their sufferings, and all\r\nidea of resistance was abandoned. Nithard induced the papal nuncio to\r\nsee Don Juan, February 24th, and ask further time for negotiation but at\r\n9 P.M. the nuncio returned with word that Nithard must leave Spain at\r\nonce. The Royal Council sat until 10 P.M. and reached the same\r\nconclusion. The next day the city was in an uproar; people carried their\r\nvaluables to the convents for safe keeping and a mob assembled around\r\nthe palace, where the Junto de Gobierno drew up a decree that Nithard\r\nmust depart within three hours. It bore that he had supplicated\r\npermission to leave and in granting it the queen, to express her\r\nsatisfaction with his services, appointed him ambassador to Germany or\r\nto Rome as he might elect, with retention of all his offices and\r\nsalaries. The queen signed this and the Archbishop of Toledo and the\r\nCount of Peñaranda were deputed to carry it to Nithard, who received it\r\nwithout a trace of emotion and placed himself at their disposal. It was\r\narranged that they should call for him at 6 P.M. The archbishop and the\r\nDuke of Maqueda came with two coaches and Nithard entered, carrying with\r\nhim nothing but his breviary. Thrice, in the streets, the howling mob\r\nthreatened an attack, but were deterred by the sight of a cross with\r\nwhich the archbishop had prudently provided himself. They drove him to\r\nFuencarral, about two leagues from the city and left him at the house of\r\nthe cura. The next day he went to San Agustin, about ten leagues\r\ndistant, where he lingered for awhile in the vain hope of recall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITOR-GENERALSHIP_]\r\n\r\nDon Juan fell back to Guadalajara, where terms were agreed upon, the\r\nprincipal articles being that Nithard should immediately resign all his\r\noffices and never return to Spain and that Diego de Valladares, Don\r\nJuan's special enemy, should have nothing to do in any matter affecting\r\nhim. Nithard accordingly went to Rome, but he had no commission to show\r\nand no instructions. He reported this to the Council of State, which\r\ntold him to urge the definition by the Holy See of the Immaculate\r\nConception. The queen endeavored by a subterfuge to obtain for him a\r\ncardinal's hat, which had been promised to Spain, but failed. He still\r\nhoped for a return to his honors, stimulated by the correspondence of\r\nhis confidential agent, the Jesuit Salinas, but a letter warning him not\r\nto resign the inquisitor-generalship, for things were tending towards\r\nhis return, with a lodging in the queen's palace, chanced to fall into\r\nthe hands of the nuncio, who placed it where it would do the most good.\r\nThe result was a peremptory order for him to resign in favor of\r\nValladares, who had been nominated as his successor. When this was\r\nhanded to him by San Roman, the Spanish ambassador, he is said to have\r\nfainted and not to have recovered his senses for an hour. The coveted\r\ncardinal's hat was bestowed on Portocarrero, Dean of Toledo, and when\r\nthe news of this reached the queen it threw her into a tertian fever.\r\nThe Jesuit General Oliva, seeing Nithard thus stripped of his offices\r\nand offended at his arrogance, ordered him to leave Rome and he retired\r\nto a convent, but he was amply provided with funds and, for some years\r\nat least, he was carried on the books of the Suprema and received his\r\nsalary regularly. Moreover, in 1672, the queen procured from Clement X\r\nwhat Clement IX had persistently refused and Nithard was created\r\nArchbishop of Edessa and cardinal.[780]\r\n\r\nValladares had received his appointment September 15, 1669. It was not\r\nuntil 1677 that he resigned his see of Plasencia and he held the\r\ninquisitor-generalship until his death, January 29, 1695. He was\r\nsucceeded by Juan Thomás de Rocaberti, Archbishop of Valencia, for whom\r\nInnocent XII, at the request of Carlos II, granted a dispensation from\r\nresidence, conditioned on his making proper provision for the spiritual\r\nand temporal care of his see.[781] He died June 13, 1699, and his\r\nsuccessor, Alfonso Fernández de Aguilar, Cardinal of Córdova, followed\r\nhim September 19th, the very day that his commission arrived, after a\r\nbrief illness and not without grave suspicions of poison.[782] The\r\nchoice then fell on Balthasar de Mendoza y Sandoval, Bishop of Segovia,\r\nwho became involved, as we shall see, in a deadly quarrel with his\r\ncolleagues of the Suprema over the case of Fray Froilan Díaz. In the\r\nconfusion of the concluding months of the disastrous reign of Carlos II,\r\nwho died November 1, 1700, Mendoza made the mistake of embracing the\r\nAustrian side; his arbitrary action, in the case of Froilan Díaz, served\r\nas a sufficient excuse for his removal and Philip V, apparently in 1703,\r\nordered him to return to his see. He is generally said to have resigned\r\nin 1705 but, in the papal commission, March 24, 1705, for his successor\r\nVidal Marin, Clement XI states that he has seen fit to relieve Mendoza\r\nof the office because his presence is necessary at Segovia.[783] Vidal\r\nMarin served till his death in 1709 and so did his successor\r\nRiva-Herrera, Archbishop of Saragossa, who, however, enjoyed his dignity\r\nfor little more than a year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITOR-GENERALSHIP_]\r\n\r\nPhilip V had brought to Spain the Gallicanism and the principles of high\r\nroyal prerogative which were incompatible with the pretensions of the\r\ncuria and the quasi-independence of the Inquisition. With the Bourbons\r\nthere opens a new era in the relations between the crown and the Holy\r\nOffice. Yet in his first open trial of strength, Philip's fatal\r\nvacillation, under the varying influences of his counsellors, confessors\r\nand wives, left him with a dubious victory. In 1711 he selected as\r\ninquisitor-general Cardinal Giudice, Archbishop of Monreal in Sicily, a\r\nNeapolitan of much ambition and little scruple. The recognition of the\r\nArchduke Charles as King of Spain by Clement XI, in 1709, had caused\r\nrelations to be broken off between Madrid and Rome. Philip dismissed the\r\nnuncio, closed the tribunal of the nunciatura and forbade the\r\ntransmission of money to Rome. There was talk in the curia of reviving\r\nthe medieval methods of reducing disobedient monarchs to submission and\r\nPhilip, to prepare for the struggle, ordered, December 12, 1713, the\r\nCouncil of Castile to draw up a statement of the regalías which would\r\njustify resistance to the demands of the curia and to the jurisdiction\r\nexercised by nuncios. It was a quarrel which had been in progress for a\r\ncentury and a half, now breaking out fiercely and then smothered, but\r\nnone the less bitter. The Council entrusted the task to its fiscal,\r\nMelchor Rafael de Macanaz, a hard-headed lawyer, fully imbued with\r\nconvictions of royal prerogative, whose report was, in general and in\r\ndetail, thoroughly subversive of Ultramontanism and consequently most\r\ndistasteful to the curia.[784] When it was presented to the council,\r\nDecember 19th, Don Luis Curiel and some others prevented a vote and\r\nasked for copies that they might consider the matter maturely. Copies\r\nwere given to each member, consideration was postponed and on February\r\n14, 1714, Molines, the ambassador at Rome, reported that copies had been\r\nsent there by Curiel, Giudice and Belluga, Bishop of Murcia. Although it\r\nwas a secret state paper, the curia issued a decree condemning it and,\r\ncoupled with it, an old work, Barclay's reply to Bellarmine and a French\r\ndefence of the royal prerogative by Le Vayer, attributed to President\r\nDenis Talon. Such a decree could not be published in Spain without\r\nprevious submission to the Royal Council, but Giudice was relied upon to\r\nevade this. He was nothing loath, for he had an old quarrel with\r\nMacanaz, who had prevented his obtaining the archbishopric of Toledo,\r\nhis enmity being so marked that at one time Philip, to separate them,\r\nhad sent Macanaz to France with the title of ambassador extraordinary,\r\nbut without functions. At the moment Giudice was ambassador to France\r\nand the decree was sent to him; he declined to act unless assured of the\r\nprotection of the courts of Rome and Vienna and, on receiving pledges of\r\nthis, he signed it, July 30th as inquisitor-general and sent it to the\r\nSuprema for publication. Four of the members promptly signed it and had\r\nit published at high mass in the churches on August 15th. This created\r\nan immense sensation and exaggerated accounts were circulated of the\r\nerrors and heresies contained in the unknown legal argument which\r\nMacanaz had prepared in the strict line of his duty.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip was informed the next day of this audacious proceeding he\r\ncalled into consultation his confessor Robinet and three other\r\ntheologians, who submitted on the 17th an opinion in writing that the\r\nSuprema should be required to suspend the edict and that Giudice should\r\nbe dismissed and banished. The Suprema obeyed, excusing itself on the\r\npretext that it had supposed, as a matter of course, that Giudice had\r\nsubmitted the edict to the king. He was not satisfied with this and\r\ndismissed three of them, but they refused to surrender their places.\r\nThen he summoned a meeting of the Council of Castile, pointing out that,\r\nif such things were permitted, the kingdom would be reduced to vassalage\r\nunder the Dataria and other tribunals of the curia; the Council was not\r\nto separate until every member had recorded his opinion as to the\r\nmeasures to be taken. Seven of them voted for dismissing and banishing\r\nGiudice, while four showed themselves favorable to the Inquisition.\r\nMeanwhile, on the 17th, Philip had despatched a courier to Paris\r\nsummoning Giudice to return and informing Louis XIV of the affair. The\r\nlatter, recognizing that the decree was an assault on the French as well\r\nas the Spanish regalías, refused to Giudice a farewell audience and sent\r\nhis confessor Le Tellier to tell him that, were he not certain that\r\nPhilip would punish him condignly, he would do so himself. When Giudice\r\nreached Bayonne he was met by an order not to enter Spain until the\r\nedict should be revoked. He replied submissively, enclosing his\r\nresignation, whereupon Philip commanded him to return to his\r\narchbishopric--a command which he did not obey. Felipe Antonio Gil de\r\nTaboada was appointed inquisitor-general and, on February 28, 1715, his\r\ncommission was despatched from Rome; probably the Suprema interposed\r\ndifficulties for he never served; he obtained the post of Governor of\r\nthe Council of Castile, to be rewarded subsequently with the\r\narchbishopric of Seville.[785]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITOR-GENERALSHIP_]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was a court revolution. María Luisa of Savoy, Philip's\r\nwife, died February 11, 1714. The Princesse des Ursins, who had\r\naccompanied her to Spain and had become the most considerable personage\r\nin the kingdom, desired to find a new bride whom she could control.\r\nGiulio Alberoni, an adroit Italian adventurer, was then serving as the\r\nenvoy of the Duke of Parma and persuaded her that Elisabeth Farnese, the\r\ndaughter of his patron, would be subservient to her, and the match was\r\narranged. December 11, 1714, Elisabeth reached Pampeluna and found\r\nAlberoni there ready to instruct her as to her course and his teaching\r\nbore speedy fruit. Des Ursins had also hastened to meet the new queen\r\nand was at Idiaguez, not far distant, where she received from the\r\nimperious young woman an order to quit Spain. Alberoni, who was in\r\nleague with Giudice and hated Macanaz, painted him to Elisabeth in the\r\ndarkest colors and his ruin was resolved upon.\r\n\r\nHe had been pursuing his duty as Fiscal-general of the Council of\r\nCastile; in July, 1714, he had occasion to make another report on the\r\nnotorious evils of the Religious Orders, pointing out the necessity of\r\ntheir reform and asserting that the pope is not the master of\r\necclesiastical property and spiritual profits. Some months later he was\r\ncalled upon to draw up a complete reform of the Inquisition, suggested\r\ndoubtless by the pending conflict, for which an occasion was found in an\r\ninsolent invasion of the royal rights by the tribunal of Lima. The\r\nCouncil of Indies complained that the latter had removed from the\r\nadministration of certain properties indebted to the royal treasury the\r\nperson appointed by the Chamber of Accounts, on the plea that the owner\r\nwas also a debtor to the Inquisition. Philip V thereupon ordered\r\nMacanaz, in conjunction with D. Martin de Miraval, fiscal of the Council\r\nof Indies, to make a report covering all the points on which the Holy\r\nOffice should be reformed. The two fiscals presented their report\r\nNovember 14, 1714, exhaustively reviewing the invasions of the royal\r\njurisdiction which, as we shall see hereafter, were constant and\r\naudacious, and their recommendations were framed with a view of\r\nrendering the Inquisition an instrument for executing the royal will, to\r\nthe subversion of the jealously-guarded principle that laymen should be\r\nwholly excluded from spiritual jurisdiction.[786]\r\n\r\nIn the reaction wrought by Elisabeth and Alberoni, Macanaz was\r\nnecessarily sacrificed. Philip, notoriously uxorious, speedily fell\r\nunder the domination of his strong-minded bride and Alberoni became the\r\nall-powerful minister. Giudice, who had been loitering on the borders,\r\nwas recalled and, on March 28, 1715, Philip abased himself by signing a\r\nmost humiliating paper, evidently drawn up by Giudice, reinstating the\r\nlatter and apologizing for his acts on the ground of having been misled\r\nby evil counsel.[787] Alberoni and Giudice, however, were too ambitious\r\nand too unprincipled to remain friends. Their intrigues clashed in Rome,\r\nthe one to obtain a cardinal's hat, the other to advance his nephew.\r\nAlberoni had the ear of the queen and speedily undermined his rival.\r\nGiudice was also tutor of the young prince Luis; on July 15, 1716, he\r\nwas deprived of the post and ordered to leave the palace and, on the\r\n25th, he was forbidden to enter it. He fell into complete disfavor and\r\nshortly left Spain for Rome, where he placed the imperial arms over his\r\ndoor. His resignation must have followed speedily for, on January 23,\r\n1717, the tribunal of Barcelona acknowledges receipt of an announcement\r\nfrom the Suprema that the pope has at last acceded to the reiterated\r\nrequests of Cardinal Giudice to be allowed to resign and has appointed\r\nin his place D. Joseph de Molines, as published in a royal decree of\r\nJanuary 9th.[788] Alberoni obtained the coveted cardinalate but his\r\ntriumph was transient. He replaced the king's confessor, Father Robinet\r\nwith another Jesuit, Father Daubenton, who soon intrigued against him so\r\nsuccessfully and so secretly that the first intimation of his fall was a\r\nroyal order, December 5, 1719, to leave Madrid within eight days and\r\nSpain in three weeks. He vainly sought an audience of Philip and was\r\nforced to obey.[789]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITOR-GENERALSHIP_]\r\n\r\nAlthough the episode of Giudice is thus closed, the fate of Macanaz is\r\ntoo illustrative of inquisitorial methods and of royal weakness to be\r\npassed over without brief mention. He had incurred the undying hatred of\r\nthe Inquisition simply in discharge of his duty as an adviser of the\r\ncrown, with perhaps an excess of zeal for his master and an intemperate\r\npatriotism that strove to restore its lost glories to Spain. It was\r\nimpossible to continue him in his high function while recalling Giudice\r\nand, as a decent cover for banishment, he was allowed, in March, 1715,\r\nto seek the waters of Bagnères for his health, when he departed on an\r\nexile that lasted for thirty-three years to be followed by an\r\nimprisonment of twelve. Giudice promptly commenced a prosecution for\r\nheresy, sufficient proof of which, according to the standards of the\r\nHoly Office, was afforded by his official papers. As he dared not\r\nreturn, his trial _in absentia_ resulted, as such trials were wont to\r\ndo, in conviction, and he seems to have been sentenced to perpetual\r\nexile with confiscation of all his property, including even five hundred\r\ndoubloons which the king was sending to him at Pau through a banker of\r\nSaragossa. All his papers and correspondence in the hands of his friends\r\nwere seized and his brother, a Dominican fraile, whom the king had\r\nplaced in the Suprema, was arrested in the hope of obtaining\r\nincriminating evidence.[790]\r\n\r\nThenceforth he led a life of wandering exile, so peculiar that it is\r\nexplicable only by the character of Philip. He was in constant\r\ncorrespondence with high state officials and was frequently entrusted\r\nwith important negotiations. Sometimes he was under salary, but it was\r\nirregularly paid and for the most part he had to struggle with poverty.\r\nWhen the Infanta María Ana Vitoria was sent back to Spain from France,\r\nin 1725, he was commissioned to attend her to the border and from there\r\nhe went as plenipotentiary to the Congress of Cambray, with the\r\ncomforting assurance that the king was endeavoring to put an end to the\r\naffair of the Inquisition--an effort apparently frustrated by the\r\ninfluence of Père Daubenton.[791] It was possibly with a view to\r\novercome this fatal enmity that he occupied his leisure, between 1734\r\nand 1736, in composing a defence of the Inquisition from the attacks of\r\nDr. Dellon and the Abbé Du Bos. In this he had nothing but praise for\r\nits kindliness towards its prisoners, its scrupulous care to avoid\r\ninjustice, the rectitude of its procedure and the benignity of its\r\npunishments. Beyond these assertions, the defence reduces itself to\r\nshowing that, from the time when the Church acquired the power to\r\npersecute, it has persecuted heretics to the death and that the heretics\r\nin their turn have been persecutors--propositions readily proved from\r\nhis wide and various stores of learning and sufficient to satisfy a\r\nbeliever in the _semper et ubique et ab omnibus_.[792] Ten years later,\r\nwhen Fernando VI ascended the throne in 1746, Macanaz addressed him a\r\nmemorial on the measures requisite to relieve the misery of Spain and in\r\nthis he superfluously urged the maintenance of the Inquisition in all\r\nits lustre and authority.[793] In spite of all this it was unrelenting\r\nand his entreaties to be allowed to return were fruitless.\r\n\r\nIn 1747 he was sent to the Congress of Breda where he mismanaged the\r\nnegotiations, deceived, it is said, by Lord Sandwich. Relieved and\r\nordered, in 1748, to present himself to the Viceroy of Navarre at\r\nPampeluna, after some delay he was carried to Coruña and immured\r\n_incomunicado_ in a casemate of the castle of San Antonio, a prison\r\nknown as a place of rigorous confinement. Even the authorities there\r\ncompassionated him and, at their intercession, he was removed to an\r\neasier prison and permitted the use of books and writing materials.\r\nHere, during a further captivity of twelve years, the indomitable old\r\nman occupied himself with voluminous commentaries on the _Teatro\r\ncrítico_ of Padre Feyjoo and the _España sagrada_ of Florez, with many\r\nother writings and memorials to the king. It was not until the death of\r\nthe latter, in 1760, that Elisabeth of Parma, the regent and the cause\r\nof his misfortunes, liberated him with orders to proceed directly to\r\nMurcia. At Leganes he was greeted by his wife and daughter, with whom he\r\nwent to Hellin, his birth-place, where he died on the following November\r\n2d, in his ninety-first year.[794]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE INQUISITOR-GENERALSHIP_]\r\n\r\nThere is no record of any further exercise of royal control over\r\ninquisitors-general until, in 1761, Clement XIII saw fit to condemn the\r\nCatechism of Mesengui for its alleged Jansenism in denying the authority\r\nof popes over kings. The debate over it in Rome had attracted the\r\nattention of all Europe and the prohibition of the book was regarded as\r\na general challenge to monarchs. Carlos III had watched the discussion\r\nwith much interest, especially as the work was used in the instruction\r\nof his son. He expressed his intention of not permitting the publication\r\nof the prohibition but, by a juggle between the nuncio and the\r\ninquisitor-general, Manuel Quintano Bonifaz, an edict of condemnation\r\nwas hastily drawn up of which copies were given to the royal confessor\r\non the night of August 7th. They did not reach the king at San Ildefonso\r\nuntil the morning of the 8th, who at once despatched a messenger to\r\nBonifaz ordering him to suspend the edict and recall any copies that\r\nmight have been sent out. Bonifaz replied that copies had already been\r\ndelivered to all the churches in Madrid and forwarded to nearly all the\r\ntribunals; to suppress it would cause great scandal, injurious to the\r\nHoly Office, wherefore he deeply deplored that he could not have the\r\npleasure of obeying the royal mandate. Carlos was incensed but contented\r\nhimself with ordering Bonifaz to absent himself from the court; he\r\nobeyed and, in about three weeks, made an humble apology, protesting\r\nthat he would forfeit his life rather than fail in the respect due to\r\nthe king. Carlos then permitted him to return and resume his functions\r\nand, when the Suprema expressed its gratitude, he significantly warned\r\nit to remember the lesson.[795] He took warning himself and, on January\r\n18, 1762, he issued a pragmática systematizing the examination of all\r\npapal letters before issuing the royal exequatur which permitted their\r\npublication.[796]\r\n\r\nCarlos III had no further occasion to exercise his prerogatives but it\r\nwas otherwise with Carlos IV. His first appointee, Manuel Abad y la\r\nSierra, Bishop of Astorga, who assumed office May 11, 1793, had but a\r\nshort term, for he was requested to resign in the following year. His\r\nsuccessor, Francisco Antonio de Lorenzana, Archbishop of Toledo, who\r\naccepted the post September 12, 1794, was not much more fortunate,\r\nalthough his enforced resignation, in 1797, was decently concealed under\r\na mission to convey to Pius VI the offer of a refuge in Majorca. He was\r\nfollowed by Ramon José de Arce y Reynoso, Archbishop of Saragossa, who\r\nresigned March 22, 1808, four days after the abdication of Carlos IV in\r\nthe \"tumult of lackeys\" at Aranjuez, probably to escape his share of the\r\npopular odium directed against the favorite Godoy.[797] During the\r\nshort-lived revival of the Inquisition under the Restoration, its\r\ndependence on the royal power was too great for differences to arise\r\nthat would provoke assertions of the prerogative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SUPREMA_]\r\n\r\nThe relations of the crown with the Suprema were originally the same as\r\nwith the other royal councils. The king appointed and removed at will\r\nalthough, as the members came to exercise judicial functions, it was\r\nnecessary for the inquisitor-general to delegate to them the papal\r\nfaculties which alone conferred on them jurisdiction over heresy.\r\nFerdinand exercised the power of appointment and removal and, as his\r\norders were requisite for the receivers of confiscations to pay their\r\nsalaries, it is scarce likely that anyone had the hardihood to raise a\r\nquestion.[798] We have seen how he forced the members to accept as a\r\ncolleague Aguirre though he was a layman, how Ximenes when governor of\r\nCastile removed him and Adrian reinstated him. The earliest formula of\r\ncommission that I have met is of the date of 1546; it bears that it is\r\ngranted by the inquisitor-general, who constitutes the appointee a\r\nmember and invests him with the necessary faculties, and it is moreover\r\ncountersigned by the other members.[799] In this there is no allusion to\r\nany nomination by the king, although the appointment lay in his hands.\r\nIn 1573 the Venitian envoy Leonardo Donato so states, adding that the\r\npopes felt very bitterly the fact that they had no participation in it;\r\nthey had repeatedly tried to secure the membership of some one dependent\r\nupon them, such as the nuncio, but Philip would not permit it; the\r\ncouncil did nothing without his consent, tacit or expressed.[800] At\r\nsome period, not definitely ascertainable, the custom arose of the\r\ninquisitor-general presenting three names from among which the king made\r\nselection. At first the number of members was uncertain, but it came to\r\nbe fixed at five, in addition to the inquisitor-general. To these Philip\r\nII added two from the Council of Castile; as these were sometimes\r\nlaymen, he finally had scruples of conscience and, in his instructions\r\nto Manrique de Lara, in 1595, he tells him that when there are fitting\r\necclesiastics in the Council of Castile they are to be proposed to him\r\nfor selection; if there are not, it is to be considered whether a papal\r\nbrief should be procured to enable them to act in matters of faith.[801]\r\nThese adventitious members came to be known as _consejeros de la tarde_,\r\nas they attended only twice a week and in the afternoon sessions of the\r\nbody, where its secular business was disposed of, and thus they took no\r\nshare in matters of faith. Their salary was one-third that of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe royal authority was emphatically asserted when, in 1614, Philip III\r\nordered that a supernumerary place should be made for his confessor Fray\r\nAliaga, with precedence over his colleagues and a salary of fifteen\r\nhundred ducats; also that when the royal confessor was a Dominican he\r\nshould always have this place and, when he was not, that it should be\r\ngiven to a Dominican. The Suprema accepted Aliaga but demurred to the\r\nrest, when Lerma peremptorily ordered it to be entered on the records;\r\nthere were murmurings followed by submission. After the accession of\r\nPhilip IV, he ordered the Council to make out a commission for his\r\nconfessor, the Dominican Sotomayor, to which there was ineffectual\r\nopposition.[802] The rule held good. Soon after the Inquisition was\r\nreorganized under the Restoration, Fernando VII, July 10, 1815,\r\nappointed his confessor, Cristóbal de Bencomo, a member to serve without\r\nsalary for the time but with the reversion of the first vacancy and all\r\nthe honors due to his predecessors; he had the seat next to the dean and\r\nwhen the latter died, February 16, 1816, he took his position and\r\nsalary.[803] Philip V ordered that a seat should always be occupied by a\r\nJesuit; this of course lapsed with the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767,\r\nafter which Carlos III, in 1778, provided that the Religious Orders\r\nshould have a representative by turns.[804]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SUPREMA_]\r\n\r\nThe royal power of appointment was not uncontested and gave rise to\r\nfrequent debates. Philip IV sometimes yielded and sometimes persisted;\r\noccasionally the question was complicated and papal intervention was\r\nhinted at.[805] A decisive struggle came in 1640, in which the Suprema\r\nchose its ground discreetly. It suited Olivares to appoint Antonio de\r\nAragon, a youthful cleric and the second son of the Duke of Cardona.\r\nAnticipating resistance, Philip announced the nomination imperiously;\r\nDon Antonio must be admitted the next day as he was about to start for\r\nBarcelona and any representations against it could be made subsequently.\r\nThe Suprema replied that the inquisitor-general could not make the\r\nappointment and if he did so it would be invalid; Don Antonio was less\r\nthan thirty years old; the canons require an inquisitor to be forty,\r\nalthough Paul III had reduced for Spain, the age to thirty; members of\r\nthe Suprema were inquisitors and it was only as such that they sat in\r\njudgement without appeal in cases of faith. To this Philip rejoined that\r\nOlivares would report the efforts he had made to quiet his conscience in\r\nview of the great public good to result from the appointment, wherefore\r\nhe expected that possession would be given to Don Antonio without delay.\r\nMatters went so far that the Duchess of Cardona wrote to her son to\r\nabandon the effort but the royal command prevailed; he obtained the\r\nposition and in the following year he was made a member of the Council\r\nof State; he was already a member of the Council of Military Orders and\r\nthe whole affair gives us a glimpse of how Olivares governed Spain.[806]\r\nHaving thus asserted his prerogative, Philip, in 1642 and the early\r\nmonths of 1643, made four appointments without consultation. The\r\nremonstrances of the Suprema must have been energetic for Philip yielded\r\nand, in a decree of June 26 (or July 2), 1643, he agreed that the old\r\ncustom of submitting three names should be renewed, with the innovation\r\nthat the Suprema should unite in making the recommendations. Against\r\nthis the inquisitor-general protested, but in vain. It was probably to\r\nmake an offset to these royal nominees that, November 10, 1643, the\r\ninquisitor-general and Suprema asked that their fiscal should have a\r\nvote, which Philip refused.[807] The rule continued of submitting three\r\nnames for selection, but the participation of the Suprema in this seems\r\nto have been dropped. The royal control, moreover asserted itself in the\r\ncase of Froilan Díaz when, by decree of November 3, 1704, Philip V\r\nreinstated three members, Antonio Zambrana, Juan Bautista Arzeamendi and\r\nJuan Miguélez, who had been arbitrarily ejected and jubilado by\r\nInquisitor-general Mendoza, ordering moreover that they should receive\r\nall arrears of salary.[808]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile thus the crown continued to exercise the right of selecting the\r\nheads of the Inquisition, its practical control was greatly weakened by\r\none or two changes which established themselves. Of these perhaps the\r\nmost important was the claim of the Suprema to interpose itself between\r\nthe king and the tribunals, so that no royal commands to them should be\r\nobeyed unless they should pass through it, thus rendering the\r\ninquisitors subject to itself alone and not to the sovereign. In a\r\ngovernment theoretically absolute this was substituting bureaucracy for\r\nautocracy and, when the example was followed, though at a considerable\r\ndistance, by some of the other royal councils, it at times produced\r\ndeadlocks which threatened to paralyze all governmental action.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, towards the end of Ferdinand's reign, his letters to\r\nthe tribunals were sometimes countersigned by members of the Suprema,\r\nbut that this was not essential to their validity and, when there was an\r\nattempt to establish such a claim, he was prompt to vindicate his\r\nauthority. A royal cédula of October 25, 1512, gave certain instructions\r\nas to the manumission of baptized children of slaves whose owners had\r\nsuffered confiscation. There was no question of faith involved, but\r\nwhen, in 1514, Pedro de Trigueros applied to the inquisitors of Seville\r\nto be set free under it, they refused on the ground that it had not been\r\nsigned by the Suprema. He appealed to Ferdinand who promptly ordered the\r\ninquisitors to obey it; if they find Pedro's story to be true they are\r\nto give him a certificate of freedom and meanwhile are to protect him\r\nfrom his master, who was seeking to send him to the Canaries for\r\nsale.[809] The claim which Ferdinand thus peremptorily rejected was\r\npersistently maintained during the period of confusion which followed\r\nhis death. Whether it received positive assent from Charles is more than\r\ndoubtful, although the Suprema so asserts in a letter of July 27 1528,\r\nordering inquisitors to examine whether a certain royal cédula had been\r\nsigned by its members, for the kings had ordered that none should be\r\nexecuted in matters connected with the Inquisition unless thus\r\nauthenticated--thus basing the claim on the royal will and not on any\r\ninherent right of the Holy Office.[810] So complete was the autonomy\r\nthus established for the organization that a _carta acordada_ or\r\ncircular of instructions May 12, 1562, tells the tribunals that, if an\r\ninquiry from the king comes to them through any other council, they are\r\nto reply that if the king desires the information it will be furnished\r\nto him through the inquisitor-general or the Suprema.[811]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SUPREMA_]\r\n\r\nThe far-reaching importance of this principle can scarce be exaggerated.\r\nOne of its results will be seen when we come to consider the complaints\r\nand demands of the Córtes and find that _fueros_ directed against\r\ninquisitorial aggressions, in purely civil matters, when agreed to by\r\nthe king were invalid without confirmation by the inquisitor-general. A\r\nsingle instance here will suffice to show the working of this. In 1599\r\nvarious demands of the Córtes of Barcelona were conceded by Philip III.\r\nOne regulated the number of familiars, which Philip promised that he\r\nwould induce the inquisitor-general to put into effect, within two\r\nmonths if possible. Another provided that all officials, save\r\ninquisitors, should be Catalans; he agreed to charge the\r\ninquisitor-general and Suprema to observe this and he would get it\r\nconfirmed by the pope. Another was that, in the secular business of the\r\ntribunal, the opinion of the Catalan assessor should govern, because he\r\nwould be familiar with the local law; this he accepted and promised, in\r\nso far as it concerned the inquisitor-general and Suprema, to charge\r\nthem to give such orders to the tribunal. Another was that commissioners\r\nand familiars should not be \"religious,\" to which his reply was the\r\nsame. Another required the inquisitor-general to appoint a resident of\r\nBarcelona to hear appeals in civil cases below five hundred libras;\r\nthis he said was just and he would charge the inquisitor-general to do\r\nso. After this, in fulfilment of his plighted word, he addressed the\r\ninquisitor-general in terms almost supplicatory \"I charge you greatly\r\nthat for your part you condescend and facilitate that what they have\r\nsupplicated may be put in execution, in conformity with what I have\r\nconceded and decreed in each of these articles, which will give me\r\nparticular contentment.\" Not the slightest attention was paid to this\r\nrequest and, on May 6, 1603, Philip repeated it \"As until now it is\r\nunderstood that not a single thing contained in it has been put in\r\nexecution and, as I desire that it be enforced, I ask and charge you to\r\ncondescend to it and help and facilitate it with the earnestness that I\r\nconfidently look for.\"[812] This second appeal was as fruitless as the\r\nfirst and the Catalans gained nothing. It is true that, in 1632, the\r\nBarcelona tribunal, in a memorial to Philip IV, asserted that Philip III\r\nhad only assented to these articles to get rid of the Catalans and that\r\nhe wrote privately to the pope asking him not to confirm them.[813]\r\n\r\nThis case may have been mere jugglery and collusion, but in general it\r\nby no means followed that royal decrees sent to the Suprema for\r\ntransmission were forwarded. If it objected, it would respond by a\r\nconsulta arguing their impropriety or illegality, and this would, if\r\nnecessary, be repeated three or four times at long intervals until,\r\nperhaps, the matter was forgotten or dropped or some compromise was\r\nreached. The privilege that all instructions must be transmitted through\r\nthe Suprema was therefore one of no little importance and it was\r\ninsisted upon tenaciously. There was a convenient phrase invented which\r\nwe shall often meet--_obedecer y no cumplir_--to obey but not to\r\nexecute, which was very serviceable on these occasions. In 1610 the\r\nSuprema argued away a cédula of Philip III as invalid because it had\r\nbeen despatched through the Council of State and the king was repeatedly\r\ntold to his face that the laws required his cédulas to be countersigned\r\nby the Suprema in order to secure their execution. This was done to\r\nPhilip IV, in 1634, when he intervened in a quarrel and, in 1681 to\r\nCarlos II when there were difficulties threatened with foreign nations\r\narising from abuses committed in examining importations in search of\r\nforbidden books.[814] As the questions calling for royal interposition\r\nas a rule affected only the wide secular and not the spiritual\r\njurisdiction of the Inquisition, this created conditions unendurable in\r\nany well-organized government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother change which conduced greatly to the independence of the\r\nInquisition was the control which it acquired over its finances. We have\r\nseen that, under Ferdinand, the confiscations and pecuniary penances\r\nbelonged to the crown and that the salaries and expenses were paid by\r\nhis orders. The finances of the Inquisition will be discussed hereafter\r\nand meanwhile it suffices to say that, after his death and the exuberant\r\nliberality of Charles to his Flemish favorites during his first\r\nresidence in Spain, the diminishing receipts from these sources caused\r\nthem to be virtually assigned to defraying the expenses of the\r\nInquisition and they were no longer regarded as a source of supply to\r\nthe royal treasury. Still, the money belonged to the crown and the\r\nInquisition enjoyed it only under the authority and by virtue of the\r\nbounty of the sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE_]\r\n\r\nThe growth of control over income and of virtual financial independence\r\nwas gradual and irregular. Even Ferdinand, in his watchful care over his\r\nreceivers of confiscations, felt the need of some central auditor and it\r\nseemed natural that he should be an official of the Suprema. Accordingly\r\nas early as 1509 we find a \"contador general\" in that position. In 1517\r\nthere are two officers, a contador and a receiver-general and, in 1520,\r\nthe two are merged into one.[815] When, in 1513, Bishop Mercader was\r\nmade inquisitor-general of Aragon he desired a statement from all\r\nreceivers of their receipts and payments and of the property remaining\r\nin their hands and Ferdinand ordered them to comply, alluding to it as\r\nusual on the entrance of a new inquisitor-general.[816] This inevitably\r\nripened into the transfer to that official of the control over receivers\r\nwhich Ferdinand had exercised, so that in place of being royal officials\r\nthey became virtually officers of the Inquisition and eventually were\r\ndesignated as treasurers. By 1544 we find the Suprema to be the final\r\ncourt of revision of all the receivers of the local tribunals, whose\r\naccounts were rendered to it and audited by it.[817]\r\n\r\nStill, in theory the money belonged to the crown and its disbursement\r\ncould only be made under royal authority. The order for the payment of\r\nthe _ayuda de costa_ of the Suprema, July 21, 1517, was drawn in the\r\nname of _la reyna y el rey_--Juana and Charles.[818] After Charles\r\nreached Spain, in September of that year he made grants from the\r\nconfiscations with a profusion that threatened to bankrupt the\r\nInquisition, and if we find Adrian and the Suprema also occasionally\r\nissuing orders for payments it was undoubtedly under powers granted by\r\nCharles.[819] When Charles left Spain, May 20, 1520, he gave Adrian a\r\ngeneral faculty for this purpose, but it seems to have been called in\r\nquestion, for he found it necessary to send from Brussels, September\r\n12th, a cédula to all receivers confirming it and stating that Adrian's\r\norders, signed by members of the Suprema, would be received as vouchers\r\nby the auditor-general. Under this the Suprema exercised full authority\r\nover the funds collected by all the receivers and disposed of them at\r\nits pleasure. When Charles returned he presumably resumed control and,\r\nafter his marriage with Isabel of Portugal, during his frequent\r\nabsences, he left the power in her hands until her death May 1,\r\n1539.[820] When he saw fit, moreover, he claimed and received a share of\r\nthe spoils. A letter of Cardinal Manrique, June 17, 1537, shows that a\r\nportion of the proceeds of a certain auto de fe had been paid to him and\r\nanother of October 11th, of the same year, addressed to him at the\r\nCórtes of Monzon, reinforces an appeal not to sacrifice the interests of\r\nthe Inquisition to the Aragonese demands, with the welcome news that the\r\nreceiver of Cuenca had arrived with the ten thousand ducats for which he\r\nhad asked from the confiscations of that tribunal.[821]\r\n\r\nCharles's hasty departure in November, 1539, to quell the insurrection\r\nof Ghent left matters in some confusion. The Suprema, on March 20, 1540,\r\nwrote to Chancellor Granvelle that cédulas for the salaries, under the\r\ncrown of Aragon, were always signed by the emperor and that the\r\ninquisitor-general could not do it; they had sent him a power for\r\nexecution similar to that given to Cardinal Adrian but he had refused to\r\nsign it, saying that they could do as under Cardinal Manrique,\r\nforgetting that there had been the empress who always signed the\r\ncédulas, wherefore they ask him to get the emperor to sign the power. He\r\ndoubtless did so, for an order, June 12th, on the receiver of Valencia\r\nto send fifteen hundred ducats for the salaries of the Suprema purports\r\nto be by virtue of a special power granted by their majesties. On\r\nCharles's return he again assumed control and when he went to Italy, in\r\n1543, he left Philip as regent, while during the absence of Philip there\r\nwere successive regents who signed cédulas as called for by the\r\nSuprema.[822]\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of these formalities, the control of the crown was\r\nbecoming scarcely more than nominal. It is true that, in 1537, Cardinal\r\nManrique declared that he could not increase salaries without the royal\r\nassent but, when the crown undertook any exercise of power, the little\r\nrespect paid to its commands is seen in the fate of an application made\r\nin 1544, by Juan Tomás de Prado, notary of the tribunal of Saragossa, to\r\nPrince Philip for an _ayuda de costa_ of three hundred ducats. Philip\r\nordered his prayer to be granted, but the death of Inquisitor-general\r\nTavera served as a convenient pretext for disregarding the command. It\r\nwas repeated, for the same amount, January 11, 1548, and finally, on\r\nJune 4th, Inquisitor-general Valdés authorized the payment of a hundred\r\nducats.[823]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE_]\r\n\r\nTo perfect the absolute control of the confiscations, thus gradually\r\nassumed, it was necessary to keep the crown in ignorance of their\r\namount. Its right to them was incontestable, and the Inquisition\r\ndeliberately abused the confidence reposed in it when their collection\r\nwas left in its hands. The less the king was allowed to know, the less\r\nlikely he was to claim his share and the policy was adopted of deceiving\r\nhim. As early as 1560 we have evidence of this in a letter to the\r\ninquisitors of Sicily instructing them, when reporting autos de fe to\r\nthe king, to suppress all statements as to the confiscations, but to\r\nreport them to the Suprema so that it may determine how far to inform\r\nhim. This was doubtless a general mandate to all the tribunals; it was\r\nrepeated in instructions of 1561 and we shall see that it became a\r\nsettled practice.[824] This systematic concealment was the more\r\nindefensible from the fact that the Inquisition was now obtaining funds\r\nfrom other sources than confiscations. We shall see hereafter how it\r\nutilized the scare caused by the discovery of Protestantism in\r\nValladolid and Seville in 1558, with the plea of additional expenses\r\nthus caused, to obtain from Paul IV a levy of a hundred thousand gold\r\nducats on the revenues of the clergy and the more permanent endowment of\r\na canonry to be suppressed for its benefit in every cathedral and\r\ncollegiate church. A large portion of the inquisitors, moreover already\r\nheld canonries and other benefices for which, under a brief of Innocent\r\nVIII, February 11, 1485, they were dispensed for non-residence.[825] The\r\nburden of the Holy Office was thus thrown largely on the ecclesiastical\r\nestablishment, which remonstrated and resisted but was compelled to\r\nsubmit. It could thus look with equanimity on the shrinkage of the\r\nconfiscations. In Valencia, an agreement was reached, in 1571, by which\r\nthe Moriscos compounded for them with an annual payment to the tribunal\r\nof twenty-five hundred ducats.[826] The Judaizing heretics had been\r\nlargely eliminated, especially the more wealthy ones, and it was not\r\nuntil some years after the conquest of Portugal, in 1580, that the\r\ninflux of Portuguese New Christians brought a new and profitable\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\nAll this tended to the financial independence of the Inquisition\r\nalthough the crown by no means abandoned its claim on the confiscations.\r\nA book of receipts given by the royal representative in Valencia for the\r\nproceeds of the confiscations in 1593 shows that, under the financial\r\npressure of the time, Philip II was reasserting his rights.[827] The\r\ntreasury was empty when Philip III succeeded to the throne in 1598 and,\r\namong his expedients to raise money, he ordered the receivers of the\r\ntribunals to send to him all the funds in their hands, promising speedy\r\nrepayment. The Suprema had no faith in the royal word and instructed\r\nthe tribunals to retain enough to meet their own wants. The obedience of\r\nthe tribunals was by no means prompt and the Suprema was obliged to\r\norder Valencia to comply with the royal demand and to furnish an oath\r\nthat no money was left.[828]\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years of Philip IV the tendency of the Inquisition to\r\nemancipate itself from royal control grew rapidly. We shall see\r\nhereafter that when, in 1629, the king called for a statement of\r\nsalaries and perquisites the Suprema equivocated and suppressed nearly\r\nall the information required. Still more significant was its attitude\r\nrespecting the colonial tribunals, which the king supported under an\r\nannual expenditure of thirty thousand pesos, with the understanding that\r\nthis should cease when the confiscations should become sufficient.\r\nThese, which had been small at first, rapidly increased in the\r\nseventeenth century and were enormous between 1630 and 1650, when the\r\nwhole trading communities of Peru and Mexico were shattered, enabling\r\nthe tribunals to make permanent investments that rendered them wealthy,\r\nbesides sending heavy remittances to the Suprema, which moreover seized\r\nthe goods and credits in Seville of the colonial Judaizers. In addition\r\nto this, in 1627, a prebend in each cathedral was suppressed for the\r\nbenefit of the tribunals. Yet the salaries were still demanded of the\r\nroyal treasury and the repeated efforts of Philip III and Philip IV,\r\nfrom 1610 to 1650, to obtain statements of the receipts from\r\nconfiscations and pecuniary penances were completely baffled. That was\r\nan inviolable secret which no royal official was allowed to penetrate.\r\nIt is true that the colonial tribunals, on their side, adopted the same\r\npolicy in concealing, as far as they could, from the Suprema the extent\r\nof their own gains.[829]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DEMANDS OF THE CROWN_]\r\n\r\nYet, in the ever-increasing distress of the crown, demands were made\r\nupon the Inquisition, as on all other departments of government, demands\r\nwhich it was forced to meet. Thus, for the ten years, 1632 to 1641\r\ninclusive, an annual sum of 2,007,360 mrs. was required of it, to aid in\r\ndefraying the cost of garrisons and fleet, and a statement of October\r\n11, 1642, shows that it had paid the aggregate of 11,583,110 in vellon\r\nand 18,700 in silver, leaving a balance still due of 8,474,790.[830]\r\nEvidently there was good reason for concealing its revenues. In the\r\nfrightful confusion of the finances which followed the revolution of\r\nPortugal and the revolt of Catalonia, in 1640, while Spain was\r\nheroically battling for existence against France and its rebellious\r\nsubjects, the demands were varied and incessant--sometimes for sums so\r\nsmall as to reveal the absolute penury of the State--and Philip's\r\nimpatient urgency, as he chafed under the dilatoriness of the responses,\r\nshows the desperate emergencies in which he was involved. In 1643 a\r\nroyal decree of February 16th ordered all officials to send their silver\r\nplate to the mint, a watch being kept and a report made so as to see\r\nthat each sent a quantity proportioned to his station. To a complaint of\r\ndelay in performance the Suprema replied that those who had sent in\r\ntheir silver could get no satisfaction from the mint--the delays were\r\nsuch that the promptitude required by the king was impossible.[831]\r\n\r\nEven more arbitrary was the seizure, in 1644 at Seville, of a remittance\r\nof 8676 ducats in silver, a remittance from the colonial tribunals to\r\nthe Suprema. In protesting against this the Suprema, February 29th, gave\r\na deplorable account of its condition, owing to the demands made upon it\r\nby the king. On the 10th he had called upon it for 16,000 ducats which\r\nit would be wholly unable to raise if deprived of the silver that had\r\nbeen seized. It was already short in 7,724,843 mrs. of its annual\r\nexpenses and the provincial tribunals were short 5,318,000, for it had\r\nimpoverished them to meet the royal demands. Last year it had sold a\r\ncenso of 18,000 ducats belonging to the tribunal of Saragossa, which was\r\nbeseeching its return. It had also given the king 10,000 ducats for the\r\ncavalry and to raise this amount it had taken the sequestrations in the\r\ntribunal of Seville--a sacred deposit--including 20,000 ducats' worth of\r\nwool, the owners of which, having been acquitted, were besieging it for\r\ntheir money. This dolorous plaint was effective in so far that the\r\nseizure at Seville was credited on account of the demand for 16,000\r\nducats.[832] How much of it was true we can only guess, for the\r\nInquisition had means of raising money outside of its judicial\r\nfunctions. When, in 1640, the king summoned its familiars and officials\r\nto render military service like the nobles, the Suprema arranged that\r\nthey should buy themselves off, and from this source was chiefly raised\r\n40,000 ducats expended on two companies of horse, in return for which,\r\nby a cédula of September 2, 1641, the king promised to maintain\r\ninviolate the privileges and exemptions of the familiars and\r\nofficials.[833]\r\n\r\nThese instances, out of many, will suffice to show how the crown, in its\r\ndays of distress, was recouping itself for abandoning the spoils of the\r\nheretics. In time these special and arbitrary demands were systematized\r\ninto an annual requirement of fifty horses, estimated at an outlay of\r\nabout 5500 ducats and the raising and equipping of two hundred foot,\r\ncosting 8000 ducats. The Suprema was in no wise prompt in meeting these\r\ndemands; a cédula of June 24, 1662, tells it that what is due for the\r\npresent year as well as the previous arrears, must be paid at once,\r\notherwise an inventory of its property must be given to the president of\r\nthe treasury, who will raise the money on it.[834] Subsequently there\r\nwas a feeble attempt to return some of these contributions and, in each\r\nof the years 1673 and 1674, a trifling payment was made of 10,000 reales\r\nvellon, but, in 1676, the Suprema stated to Carlos II that in all it had\r\nfurnished for remounts of horses 90,000 ducats vellon and 10,000 in\r\nsilver and that its total assistance to the crown had amounted to no\r\nless than 800,000 pesos, equivalent to over 500,000 ducats, to\r\naccomplish which the salaries in many tribunals had been unpaid and\r\nvacancies of necessary offices had remained unfilled.[835] Still, as we\r\nshall have occasion to see, the Suprema always had money, not only for\r\nan undiminished pay-roll but for perquisites and amusements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CLAIM ON THE CONFISCATIONS_]\r\n\r\nThe crown could not accept this assistance, however grudgingly rendered,\r\nwithout a sacrifice of its supremacy and the Inquisition came to treat\r\nwith it as with an independent body. About this time the Suprema happens\r\nto mention, in a letter to the tribunal of Lima, that it had lent the\r\nking 40,000 pesos, of which 10,000 came from Peru and 30,000 from Mexico\r\nand that the Count of Medellin had become security for the return of the\r\nloan, as though it were a banker dealing with a merchant.[836] Yet all\r\nparties knew that these colonial remittances were derived from\r\nconfiscations, the ownership of which the crown had never relinquished.\r\nThis is the more noteworthy because, about this time, the king suddenly\r\nasserted his claims on some large sums which could not be wholly\r\nconcealed. In 1678 the tribunal of Majorca unexpectedly made a\r\nsuccessful raid on the whole New Christian population of Palma and, in\r\nthe early months of 1679, there were more than two hundred penitents\r\nreconciled. As they constituted the active trading element of the place\r\nthe confiscations were enormous and the affair attracted too much\r\nattention to be hidden. As soon as the news came of the arrests, the\r\nking wrote, May 20, 1678, to the viceroy to look carefully to the\r\nsequestrations because, in case of confiscation, the proceeds belonged\r\nto the treasury. The Suprema, however, made him hold his hands off with\r\ndireful threats and kept control of the liquidation. After the\r\ncondemnations, a consulta of July 5, 1679, shows that 50,000 pesos had\r\nalready been paid to the king, but that the Inquisition was resolved to\r\nhave its full share. In November the king acceded to a compromise under\r\nwhich 200,000 pesos were to be used to endow certain tribunals and to\r\ncancel certain loans made to him by the Inquisition--probably those just\r\nalluded to. The balance coming to him was estimated at 250,000 pesos\r\nbut, in the handling of the assets and the settlements with creditors,\r\nthe property melted away till the Suprema reported that it barely\r\nsufficed to meet the portion assigned to the Inquisition and finally, in\r\n1683, the king had to content himself with 18,000 pesos spent on the\r\nfortifications of Majorca and the payment to him of 2000, which the\r\nSuprema assured him that it advanced at considerable risk to\r\nitself.[837]\r\n\r\nThe secretiveness so carefully observed undoubtedly had its advantages\r\nor it would not have been so persistently claimed as a right. In a\r\nconsulta of 1696 the Count of Frigiliana states that, when he was\r\nviceroy of Valencia, he had in vain endeavored to get from the tribunal\r\na statement of its affairs and he asked the king whether or not the\r\nInquisition possessed the privilege of rendering no account of its\r\nassets and income.[838] At length the quarrel between Inquisitor-general\r\nMendoza and his colleagues, in the case of Froilan Díaz, and his\r\nbanishment to his see in 1703, gave opportunity for royal intervention\r\nand investigation. The War of Succession had deranged the finances of\r\nthe Inquisition and it had appealed to the king for help. He required a\r\nstatement of the pay-rolls, investments and revenues of all the\r\ntribunals, which was furnished March 9, 1703, after which, on May 27th,\r\nhe issued a decree declaring that he must put an end to the abuses and\r\ndisorders which had crept into the administration and disbursement of\r\nits property, in order to relieve the embarrassment of which it\r\ncomplained. He therefore annulled all commissions and appointments\r\nwithout obligation of service, granted by the inquisitor-general,\r\nwhether within or outside of Spain. The papers of all jubilations, new\r\nplaces and gratuities created or granted since the time of Valladares\r\n(1695) were to be placed in his hands. In no case thereafter should the\r\ninquisitor-general jubilate any official of the Suprema or local\r\ntribunal without consulting him, and any such act issued without a\r\nprevious royal order was declared void. No _ayuda de costa_ or grant\r\nexceeding thirty ducats vellon, for a single term, was to be made\r\nwithout awaiting his decision and this decree was to be placed in the\r\nhands of all receivers or treasurers for their guidance. It was so\r\ntransmitted June 8th, with strict orders for its observance. This was a\r\nresolute assertion of the royal control over the finances of the\r\nInquisition and it held good, in theory at least, however much it may\r\nhave been eluded in practice. About the middle of the eighteenth century\r\na systematic writer describes it as still in force and states that no\r\nsalaries can be increased without the royal approval. It so continued to\r\nthe end and, under the Restoration, an order from the king,\r\ncountersigned by the Suprema, was requisite for any extraordinary\r\ndisbursement.[839]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FINES AND PENANCES_]\r\n\r\nPhilip also reasserted and made good the right of the crown to the\r\nconfiscations, by claiming a percentage of the rentals of all\r\nconfiscated property, but he listened to appeals from the tribunals and,\r\nin 1710, we hear of Saragossa and Valencia being practically restored to\r\ntheir enjoyment, a liberality which was doubtless followed with regard\r\nto the others. In 1725 Valencia expressed its fear that the alliance\r\nwith Austria against England, France and Prussia would result in its\r\nhaving to restore the confiscations, and the blow seems to have fallen\r\nfor, in 1727, the suprema, in a consulta of December 9th, describing the\r\npoverty of Saragossa, attributes it to the king having taken away the\r\nconfiscations which he had granted. With the gradual amelioration in the\r\nSpanish finances, this source of revenue must have been restored, for,\r\nin 1768, the Inquisition is described as enjoying the confiscations\r\nwhich the pious liberality of the monarchs had bestowed.[840]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were other sources of revenue--rehabilitations or dispensations\r\nfrom the sanbenito and disabilities, commutations of punishment and the\r\npecuniary penances known as _penas y penitencias_. All these will be\r\nconsidered hereafter, but a few words may be said as to the latter in\r\ntheir relation with the royal authority.\r\n\r\nThe penitents who were reconciled under Edicts of Grace were not subject\r\nto confiscation, but were punished with fines under the guise of\r\npecuniary penance, at the discretion of the inquisitor. We have seen\r\n(pp. 169-70) how numerous these were and we can conjecture how large\r\nwere the sums thus exacted, for penances of a half or a third of the\r\npenitent's property were not uncommon. Similar fines also usually\r\naccompanied sentences that did not embrace confiscation and formed a\r\ncontinual although fluctuating source of revenue. Sometimes there were\r\nspecial officials for their collection but, when this was entrusted to\r\nthe receivers of confiscations, they were instructed to keep a separate\r\naccount of them, as the two funds were held to be essentially different\r\nand, as a rule, were to be employed for different purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest Instructions of 1484, these pecuniary penances are said\r\nto be imposed as a _limosna_, or alms, to aid the sovereigns in the\r\npious work of warring with the Moors, but, in the Instructions issued a\r\nfew months later by Torquemada, this is modified by ordering them to be\r\nplaced in the hands of a trustworthy person and reports to be made to\r\nhim or to the king, in order that they may be spent on the war or in\r\nother pious uses or in paying the salaries of the Inquisition.[841]\r\nBoth the destination and the control of these funds were thus left\r\nundetermined and they so continued for some years. In 1486 we find\r\nFerdinand giving orders for sums from this source for various uses--for\r\nthe war with Granada, to pay the salaries of a lay judge, to pay\r\nexpenses of a tribunal of the Inquisition, to repay Luis de Santangel\r\nfor advances made to tribunals; in one case his tone is apologetic and\r\nhe asks Torquemada to confirm the order, in others his command is\r\nabsolute.[842]\r\n\r\nThis indicates the uncertainty which existed both as to the use and the\r\ncontrol of the pecuniary penances. So long as lasted the war with\r\nGranada, whatever was taken by the crown might be regarded as devoted,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, to that holy object, but when the conquest was\r\nachieved, in January, 1492, that excuse no longer existed and doubtless\r\nthe inquisitors looked with jealousy upon the diversion to secular\r\nobjects of the proceeds of their pious labors. The confiscations\r\nunquestionably belonged to the crown, but the penances were spiritual\r\nfunds which for centuries had always enured to the Church. There must\r\nhave been a sustained effort to withhold them from the royal\r\nacquisitiveness, to which Ferdinand was not disposed to yield, for he\r\nprocured from Alexander VI, February 18, 1495, a brief directing the\r\ninquisitors to hold all such moneys subject to the control of the\r\nsovereigns, to be disposed of at their pleasure. Even this was resisted\r\nand Ferdinand and Isabella complained to the pope that they were unable\r\nto compel an accounting of the sums received or to collect the amounts,\r\nto correct which Alexander issued another brief, March 26, 1495,\r\ncommissioning Ximenes, then Archbishop of Toledo, to enforce accounting\r\nand payment by excommunication and other censures.[843]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FINES AND PENANCES_]\r\n\r\nThis was equally ineffective. There was a privacy and simplicity in the\r\nimposition and collection of a penance very different from the procedure\r\nof sequestration and confiscation, and Ferdinand, at least for a time,\r\nabandoned the struggle. This is manifested by a clause in the\r\nInstructions of 1498, enjoining on inquisitors not to impose penances\r\nmore heavily than justice requires in order to insure the payment of\r\ntheir salaries,[844] and the principle was formally recognized by\r\nFerdinand and Isabella in a cédula of January 12, 1499, reciting that,\r\nalthough they held a papal brief placing at their disposal all moneys\r\narising from penances, commutations and rehabilitations, yet they grant\r\nto the inquisitors-general all collections from these sources, both in\r\nCastile and Aragon, to be used in paying salaries, disbursements being\r\nmade only on their order.[845]\r\n\r\nFerdinand, however, was not disposed to relax, on any point, his control\r\nover the Inquisition and, on April 10th of the same year, we find him\r\nforbidding the levying of penances on the members of a town-council for\r\nfautorship of heresy--doubtless a speculative infliction for some\r\nassumed neglect in arresting suspects. In 1501 his renunciation is\r\nalready forgotten and he is making grants from the penances as\r\nabsolutely as ever--even empowering Inquisitor-general Deza to use those\r\nof Valencia, to the extent of a hundred ducats a year for the salary of\r\nJaime de Muchildos, the Roman agent of the Inquisition.[846] So, in\r\n1511, we find him granting to Enguera, Inquisitor-general of Aragon, a\r\nthousand libras out of the penances to defray the expenses of his bulls\r\nfor the see of Lérida and authorizing him to pay from them an _ayuda de\r\ncosta_ of two hundred ducats to Joan de Gualbes, a member of the\r\nAragonese Suprema. Then, in 1514, he places all the penances\r\nunreservedly at the disposal of Inquisitor-general Mercader to be\r\nemployed on the salaries and other necessary expenses of the Inquisition\r\nof Aragon. This seems to have been final. After his death, instructions\r\nsent to the tribunal of Sicily assume that the inquisitor-general has\r\nsole and absolute control. It was the same in Castile. Instructions\r\nissued by Ximenes, in 1516, direct the receiver-general, who was an\r\nofficer of the Suprema, to collect the penances from the receivers of\r\nthe tribunals, who were to keep them in a separate account and not to\r\ndisburse them without an order from the inquisitor-general. After this\r\nwe find the Suprema in full control.[847]\r\n\r\nThere is virtually no trace of any interference subsequently by the\r\ncrown, and the Inquisition found itself in possession of an independent\r\nand by no means inconsiderable source of revenue which it could levy,\r\nalmost at will, from those who fell into its hands. The only exception\r\nto this that I have met is that Philip IV, in his financial distress, by\r\na decree of September 30, 1639, claimed and collected twenty-five per\r\ncent. of fines, but he scrupulously limited this to those inflicted in\r\ncases not connected with the faith--that is, in the exercise of the\r\nroyal jurisdiction, civil and criminal, enjoyed by the Inquisition in\r\nmatters concerning familiars and other officials.[848]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _IRRESPONSIBILITY_]\r\n\r\nThough, as we have seen, the independence of the Inquisition, as a\r\nself-centered and self-sustaining institution in the State, varied with\r\nthe temper and the necessities of the sovereign, there was a time when\r\nit seemed as though it might throw off all subjection and become\r\ndominant. But for the prudence of Ferdinand, in insisting upon the power\r\nof appointment and dismissal, this might have happened in the temper of\r\nthe Spanish people, trained to an exaltation of detestation of heresy\r\nwhich to us may well appear incomprehensible. There is no question that,\r\nunder the canon law, kings, like their subjects, were amenable to the\r\njurisdiction of the Inquisition and that they held their kingdoms on the\r\ntenure not only of their own orthodoxy but of purging their lands of\r\nheresy and heretics. The principles which had been worked so effectually\r\nfor the destruction of the Houses of Toulouse and of Hohenstaufen and\r\nunder which Pius V released the subjects of Queen Elizabeth from their\r\nallegiance, in 1570, were fully recognized in Spain as vital to the\r\nfaith.[849] But beyond this the Spaniards, in the exuberance of their\r\nreligious ardor, boasted that their national institutions conditioned\r\northodoxy as necessary to their kingship. Even when the seventeenth\r\ncentury was well advanced, a learned and loyal jurisconsult tells us\r\nthat, from the time of the sixth Council of Toledo, in 638, their\r\nmonarchs had imposed on themselves the law that, if they fell into\r\nheresy, they were to be excommunicated and exterminated; that Ferdinand,\r\nin 1492, had renewed this law and that he had instituted that most\r\nsevere tribunal the Inquisition and had sanctioned that, in view of the\r\nToledan canon, all kings in future should be subject to it.[850] Even\r\nSpanish loyalty could not have been relied upon to sustain a king\r\nsuspect of heresy, against the claims of the Holy Office to try him in\r\nsecret, and suspicion of heresy was a very elastic term. Impeding the\r\nInquisition came within its definition and any effort to curb the\r\narrogant extension of its powers could readily be so construed, as\r\nMacanaz found to his sorrow. The fact that the Inquisition possessed\r\nsuch power must have had its influence more than once on the mind of the\r\nsovereign when engaged in debate with his too powerful subject and\r\nperhaps explains what appears to us occasionally a pusillanimous\r\nyielding.\r\n\r\nThe monarchs had guarded the Inquisition against all supervision and all\r\naccountability to the other departments of government. Within its own\r\nsphere it was supreme and irresponsible and its sphere, owing to the\r\nexemption from the secular courts accorded to all connected with it in\r\nhowever remote a degree, covered a large area of civil and criminal\r\nbusiness, besides its proper function of preserving the purity of the\r\nfaith. In this self-centered independence it stood alone. Even the\r\nspiritual jurisdiction of the Church, so jealously guarded, had become\r\nsubject to the _recurso de fuerza_, which, like the French _appel comme\r\nd'abus_, gave to those who suffered wrong an appeal to the Council of\r\nCastile.[851] But even from this the Inquisition was exempt. A decree of\r\nPrince Philip, in 1553, was its ægis and was constantly invoked. This\r\nwas addressed to all the courts and judicial officers of the land and\r\naffirmed, in the most positive terms, the sole and exclusive\r\njurisdiction of the Inquisition in all matters within its competence,\r\ncivil or criminal, concerning the faith or confiscations--and faith was\r\na convenient term covering the impeding of the Inquisition in all that\r\nit wanted to do. Philip recited that repeated cédulas of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella and of Charles V had asserted this and now he reaffirmed and\r\nenforced it. No appeals from its tribunals were to be entertained, for\r\nthe only appeal lay to the Suprema, which would redress any wrong, for\r\nit, by delegation from the crown and the Holy See, had exclusive\r\ncognizance of such matters. If therefore anything concerning the\r\nInquisition should be brought before them they must decline to entertain\r\nit and must refer it back to the Holy Office.[852]\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition was not content to enjoy these favors as a revocable\r\ngrace from the crown but, in a consulta of December 22, 1634, it\r\nadvanced the claim that this decree was a bargain or compact between two\r\npowers which could not be in any way modified without mutual\r\nconsent.[853] This was emphasized in a printed argument in 1642,\r\nasserting that that transaction could only become of binding force by\r\nthe consent of both parties--the king and the inquisitor-general--and\r\nthe king had no power to change it of his own motion, as it was an\r\nagreement. Even were it admitted to be a concession granted by the\r\ncrown, this would make no difference, for a privilege conceded to one\r\nwho is not a subject (as the Inquisition in the present case) and\r\naccepted by the latter becomes a contract which the prince cannot\r\nrevoke.[854]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EFFORTS AT INDEPENDENCE_]\r\n\r\nWe shall see hereafter the use made of this by the Inquisition in its\r\ndaily quarrels with all the other jurisdictions, but a single case may\r\nbe cited here to indicate how it utilized this position to render itself\r\nvirtually independent. There was a long-standing debate over canonries\r\nin the churches of Antequera, Málaga and the Canaries, which it claimed\r\nto be suppressed for its benefit under the brief of January 7, 1559, but\r\nwhich the royal Camara asserted to belong to the patronage of the king,\r\nwhose rights of appointment were not curtailed by the brief. A suit on\r\nthe subject, commenced in 1562, was not yet decided when, about 1611,\r\nthe king filled vacancies in Málaga and the Canaries. This provoked a\r\ndiscussion, during which, without awaiting settlement, the inquisitors\r\nexcommunicated the appointees--and an inquisitorial excommunication\r\ncould be removed only by him who had fulminated it, by the\r\ninquisitor-general or by the pope. In 1611 the king ordered the\r\nappointees to be absolved and mandates signed by him to that effect were\r\naddressed to the inquisitors of Málaga and the Canaries. The Suprema\r\ncomplained loudly of this as an unheard of violation of the rights of\r\nthe Holy Office and refused obedience. In 1612 it declared that, when\r\nthe appointees abandoned the prebends which they had usurped, they\r\nshould be absolved and not before. On February 12th, in a consulta to\r\nthe king, it argued that its power had always been so great and so\r\nindependent of all other bodies in the State that the kings had never\r\nallowed them to interfere with it, directly or indirectly; it determined\r\nfor itself everything relating to itself, consulting only with the king\r\nand permitting no interference of any kind. Its determination prevailed\r\nover the weakness of the king who ordered the Camara to desist from its\r\npretensions and not to despoil the Holy Office.[855]\r\n\r\nThese somewhat audacious assertions of independence were chiefly\r\nstimulated by the perpetual quarrels arising from the exclusive\r\njurisdiction, civil and criminal, exercised by the Inquisition over its\r\nthousands of employees and familiars and their families, which kept the\r\nland in confusion. This is a subject which will require detailed\r\nconsideration hereafter and is only referred to here because of its\r\ndevelopment into the exaggerated pretensions of the Inquisition to\r\nemancipate itself from all control. When Ferdinand granted this _fuero_\r\nit was understood on all hands to be a special deputation of the royal\r\njurisdiction and as such liable at any time to modification or\r\nrevocation. Ferdinand himself, in a cédula of August 18, 1501, alluded\r\nto it as such--the inquisitors enjoyed it just as the corregidors\r\ndid.[856] So, in the Concordia of Castile, in 1553, defining the extent\r\nof this jurisdiction, the inquisitors are specially described as holding\r\nit from the king, and Philip II, Philip III and Philip IV repeatedly\r\nalluded to it as held during the royal pleasure.[857] There was no\r\nthought of disputing this until the seventeenth century was well\r\nadvanced. The Suprema itself, in papers of 1609, 1619, 1637 and 1639\r\nfreely admitted that its temporal jurisdiction was a grant from the\r\nking, while its spiritual was a grant from the pope.[858]\r\n\r\nApparently the earliest departure from this universally conceded\r\nposition was made, in 1623, by Portocarrero in an argument on a clash of\r\njurisdictions in Majorca, wherein he sought to prove that the civil and\r\ncriminal jurisdiction of the Inquisition over its subordinates was\r\necclesiastical and derived from the pope.[859] About the same time, in\r\nan official paper, a similar claim was advanced, based on the papal\r\nbriefs authorizing Torquemada and his successors to appoint, dismiss and\r\npunish their subordinates.[860] These were mere speculations and\r\nattracted no attention at the time. We have just seen that as late as\r\n1639 the Suprema made no claims of the kind but two years later, in\r\n1641, it suddenly adopted them in the most offensive fashion. There was\r\na _competencia_, or conflict of jurisdiction, between the tribunal of\r\nValladolid and the chancillería or high royal court; the Council of\r\nCastile had occasion to present several consultas to the king, in one of\r\nwhich it said that the jurisdiction exercised in the name of the king by\r\nthe Inquisition was temporal, secular and precarious and could not be\r\ndefended by excommunication. Thereupon the Suprema assembled its\r\ntheologians who pronounced these propositions to be false, rash and akin\r\nto heretical error; armed with this opinion the fiscal, or prosecuting\r\nofficer, accused the whole Council of Castile, demanded that its\r\nconsulta be suppressed and that its authors be prosecuted. Theoretically\r\nthere was nothing to prevent such action, which would have rendered the\r\nInquisition the dominating power in the land, but the Suprema lacked\r\nhardihood; even the habitual subservience of Philip IV was revolted and\r\nhe told the inquisitor-general that he had done ill to lend himself to a\r\nquestion contrary to the sovereignty of the monarch and to the honor of\r\nthe highest council of the nation.[861]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EFFORTS AT INDEPENDENCE_]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this rebuff, having once asserted the claim that its\r\ntemporal jurisdiction was spiritual and not secular, the Inquisition\r\nadhered to it. The prize was worth a struggle, for it would have put the\r\nwhole nation at its mercy. It would have deprived the king of powers to\r\ncheck aggression and to protect his subjects from oppression for, as\r\nPortocarrero had pointed out, although princes have authority to relieve\r\ntheir subjects when aggrieved by other secular subjects, they have none\r\nwhen the oppressors are ecclesiastics, exempt by divine law from their\r\njurisdiction.[862] To win this the Inquisition persisted in its claim.\r\nIn 1642, on the occasion of a _competencia_ in Granada, there appeared,\r\nunder its authority, a printed argument to prove that the temporal\r\njurisdiction of the Holy Office was a grant from the Holy See, which had\r\npower to intervene in the internal affairs of States and that it had\r\nmerely been acquiesced in and confirmed by the kings.[863] Again, in a\r\nnotorious case occurring in Cuenca in 1645, the inquisitors argued that\r\ntheir temporal jurisdiction was ecclesiastical and papal, with which the\r\nking could not interfere.[864] But the audacity with which these\r\npretensions were pushed culminated in a consulta presented by the\r\nSuprema, March 31, 1646, to Philip IV, when he was struggling against\r\nthe determination of the Córtes of Aragon to curb the excesses of the\r\nInquisition.\r\n\r\nIn this paper the Suprema asserted that the civil and political\r\njurisdiction is inferior to the spiritual and ecclesiastical, which can\r\nassume by indirect power whatever is necessary for its conservation and\r\nunimpeded exercise, without being restricted by secular princes. The\r\nroyal prerogative is derived from positive human law or the law of\r\nnations; the supreme power of the Inquisition is delegated by the Holy\r\nSee for cases of faith with all that is requisite, directly or\r\nindirectly, for its untrammelled enjoyment; this is of divine law and,\r\nas such, is superior to all human law, to which it is in no way subject.\r\nThe very least that can be said is that princes are bound to admit this,\r\nand though they have a right to concede no more than is requisite, the\r\ndecision as to what is requisite rests with the ecclesiastical\r\nauthority, which is based on divine law. Any departure from these\r\nprinciples, under the novel pretext that the king is master of this\r\njurisdiction, with power to limit or abrogate, is dangerous for the\r\nconscience and very perilous as leading to the gravest errors.[865] It\r\nwould be difficult to enunciate more boldly the theory of theocracy,\r\nwith the Inquisition as its delegate and the crown merely the executor\r\nof its decrees.\r\n\r\nThese pretensions were not realized and the king was not reduced to\r\ninsignificance, but his power was seriously trammelled by the\r\nbureaucracy of which the Suprema was the foremost and most aggressive\r\nrepresentative. Its quasi-independence led to emulation by the other\r\ngreat departments of the State and though their success was not so\r\nmarked, it was sufficient in all to render the government incredibly\r\ncumbersome and inefficient and to paralyze its action by wasting its\r\nstrength in efforts to keep the peace between the rival and warring\r\nbodies. In these bickerings and dissensions the power of the crown\r\ndecreased and the theoretically autocratic monarch found himself unable\r\nto enforce his commands. Philip IV recognized this fatal weakness, but\r\nhis efforts to overcome the evil were puerile and inefficient. October\r\n15, 1633, he sent to the Suprema, and presumably to the other councils,\r\na decree setting forth emphatically that the slackness of obedience and\r\ndisregard of the royal commands had been the cause of irreparable damage\r\nto the State and must be checked if the monarchy were to be preserved\r\nfrom ruin. It was his duty, under God, to prevent this; he had\r\nunavailingly represented it repeatedly to his councillors and now he\r\nproposed to make out a schedule of penalties, to be incurred through\r\ndisobedience, scaled according to the gravity of each offence. This was\r\nto be completed within twenty days and he called upon the Suprema to\r\ngive him the necessary information that should enable him to tabulate\r\nthe matters coming within its sphere of action.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EFFORTS AT INDEPENDENCE_]\r\n\r\nThis grotesque measure, calling upon offenders to define their offences\r\nfor the purpose of providing condign punishment, was received by the\r\nSuprema with a cool indifference showing how lightly it regarded the\r\nroyal indignation. There was nothing, it said in reply, within its\r\njurisdiction which imperilled the monarchy, for its function was to\r\npreserve the monarchy by preserving the unity of religion. As for\r\nobedience, it was of the highest importance that the royal commands\r\nshould be obeyed and the laws provided punishments for all disobedient\r\nvassals. But the canon and imperial laws and those of Spain deprived of\r\ntheir places judges, who executed royal cédulas issued against justice\r\nand the rights of parties, for it was assumed that such could not be the\r\nroyal intention and that they were decreed in ignorance, so that they\r\nwere suspended until the prince, better informed, should provide\r\njustice. Therefore when councillors opposed cédulas which would work\r\ngreat injury to the jurisdiction and immunities of the Holy Office, it\r\nwas only to prevent innovation and it was in the discharge of duty that\r\nthis was represented to the king. The Suprema therefore prayed him that,\r\nbefore determining matters proposed by other councils, they should be\r\nsubmitted to it as heretofore so that, after hearing the reasons of both\r\nsides, he might determine according to his pleasure.[866] Thus with\r\nscarcely veiled contempt the Suprema told him that it would continue to\r\ndo as it had done and the very next year, as we have seen, it boldly\r\ninformed him that none of his commands respecting the Inquisition would\r\nbe obeyed until it should have confirmed them--commands, be it\r\nremembered, that in no case affected its action in matters of faith, for\r\nall the trouble arose from its encroachments on secular affairs.\r\n\r\nThe character of Philip IV ripened and strengthened under adversity and,\r\nin the exigencies of the struggle with Catalonia and Portugal, he\r\ndeveloped some traits worthy of a sovereign. Although he meekly endured\r\nthe insolence of the Suprema in 1646 and labored strenuously with the\r\nCórtes of Aragon to prevent the reform of abuses, he yet, as we have\r\nseen, insisted on the right to supervise appointments. He doubtless\r\nasserted his authority in other ways for the Suprema abated its\r\npretensions that its civil and criminal jurisdiction was spiritual and\r\npapal. In an elaborate consulta of March 12, 1668, during a long and\r\ndreary contest, in which the tribunal of Majorca was involved, it\r\nrepeatedly refers to its enjoying the royal jurisdiction from the king,\r\nshowing that it had abandoned the attempt to render itself independent\r\nof the royal authority.[867]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REASSERTION OF ROYAL SUPREMACY_]\r\n\r\nUnder the imbecile Carlos II and his incapable ministers, the\r\ndomineering arrogance of the Inquisition increased and, as we shall see\r\nhereafter, it successfully eluded a concerted movement, in 1696, of all\r\nthe other councils, represented in the Junta Magna, to reduce its\r\nexuberance. With the advent of the House of Bourbon, however, it was\r\nforced to recognize its subordination to the royal will in temporal\r\nmatters, in spite of the temporary interference of Elisabeth Farnese in\r\nfavor of Inquisitor-general Giudice. We have already seen indications of\r\nthis and shall see more; meanwhile a single instance will suffice to\r\nshow how imperiously Philip V, under the guidance of Macanaz, could\r\nimpose his commands. In 1712 there was an echo of the old quarrel over\r\nthe so-called suppressed canonries of Antequera, Málaga and the Canaries\r\n(p. 342). The suit, commenced in 1562, had never been decided and had\r\nlong been suspended. The trouble of 1612 had been quieted by allowing\r\nthe Inquisition to enjoy the canonries, not as a right, but as a\r\nrevocable grant from the crown; excesses committed by the inquisitors in\r\ncollecting the fruits led to the resumption of the benefices and then,\r\nby a transaction in 1622, they were restored under the same conditions.\r\nSuch was the position when a violent quarrel arose in the Canaries\r\nbetween the tribunal and the chapter. The former questioned the accuracy\r\nof the accounts rendered to it and demanded the account books. This the\r\nchapter refused but offered to place the books in the accounting room of\r\nthe cathedral, allowing the officials of the tribunal free access and\r\npermission to make what copies they desired. There was also a subsidiary\r\nquarrel over the claim that, when the secretary of the tribunal went to\r\nthe chapter, he should be entitled to precedence. With their customary\r\nviolence the inquisitors publicly excommunicated and fined the dean and\r\ntreasurer of the chapter and moreover they took under their protection\r\nthe Dominican Joseph Guillen, Prior of San Pedro Martir, who was a\r\nnotary of the tribunal. He circulated a defamatory libel on the chapter\r\nwhich laid a complaint before his superior, the Provincial; the latter\r\ncommenced to investigate, when the tribunal inhibited him from all\r\ncognizance of the matter. Then there came a mandate from the Dominican\r\nGeneral to the Provincial, relegating Fray Guillen to a convent and\r\nordering a president to be appointed for San Pedro Martir, whereupon the\r\ntribunal required the Provincial to surrender this mandate and all\r\npapers concerning the affair, under pain of excommunication and two\r\nhundred ducats. The sub-prior of San Pedro Martir was forced to assemble\r\nthe brethren, whom the inquisitors ordered to disobey the commands of\r\nthe General and not to acknowledge the president appointed under his\r\ninstructions, thus violating the statutes of the great Dominican Order\r\nand the principle of obedience on which it was based. They further\r\nexcommunicated the Provincial in the most solemn manner; they took by\r\nforce Fray Guillen from the convent and paraded the streets in his\r\ncompany; the whole community was thrown into confusion and to prevent\r\nrecourse to the home authorities they forbade, under heavy penalties,\r\nthe departure of any vessel for Teneriffe, through which communication\r\nwas had with Spain. In all this there was nothing at variance with the\r\ncustomary methods of asserting the lawless supremacy of the Inquisition\r\nover the secular and spiritual authorities, but Philip V ordered\r\nGiudice, September 30, 1712, to put an end to these excesses and, on\r\nOctober 11th, the Suprema reported that it had ordered the inquisitors\r\nto desist. If it did so, they paid no attention to its commands. Then,\r\nJune 11, 1713, he addressed a peremptory order to Giudice to revoke all\r\nthat had been done in the Canaries, to recall the inquisitors, to\r\ndismiss them and give them no other appointments. The Suprema replied,\r\nJuly 18th, enclosing an order which it proposed despatching; this\r\ndispleased him as not in compliance with his commands and he insisted on\r\ntheir complete fulfilment. Still there was evasion and delay and when,\r\nin July, 1714, the Canary chapter presented to the tribunal royal orders\r\nrequiring the removal of the excommunications and the remission of the\r\nfines, the inquisitors not only refused obedience but commenced\r\nproceedings against the notaries who served them. The Suprema professed\r\nto have sent orders similar to those of the king, but it evidently had\r\nbeen playing a double game. Philip therefore, November 1, 1714,\r\naddressed the inquisitor-general, holding the Suprema responsible for\r\nthe prolonged contumacy of the inquisitors; he ordered it to deliver to\r\nhim the originals of all the correspondence on the subject and required\r\nthe inquisitor-general to issue an order for the immediate departure\r\nfrom the islands of the inquisitors and fiscal, without forcing the\r\ngovernor to expel them, as he had orders to do so in case of\r\ndisobedience. Moreover, if the Suprema should not, within fifteen days,\r\ndeliver all the documents, so that the king could regulate matters\r\ndirectly with the tribunal, the old suspended suit would be reopened and\r\nsuch action would be taken as might be found requisite. This was a tone\r\nwholly different from that to which the Inquisition had been accustomed\r\nunder the Hapsburgs; the evasions and delays of the Suprema, which had\r\nso long been successful, proved fruitless. The struggle was prolonged,\r\nbut the royal authority prevailed in the end, although, when the\r\ninquisitors reached Spain, in the summer of 1715, Giudice had been\r\nrestored to office and Philip weakly permitted them to be provided for\r\nin other tribunals and to curse fresh communities with their lawless\r\naudacity.[868]\r\n\r\nWe shall hereafter have occasion to see how, under the House of Bourbon,\r\nwith its Gallican ideas as to royal prerogative, the subordination of\r\nthe Inquisition became recognized, while its jurisdiction was curtailed\r\nand its influence was diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSUPEREMINENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Inquisition, as we have seen, arrogated to itself almost an\r\nequality with the sovereign, it necessarily assumed supremacy over all\r\nother bodies in the State. Spain had been won to the theory, assiduously\r\ntaught by the medieval Church, that the highest duty of the civil power\r\nwas the maintenance of the faith in its purity and the extermination of\r\nheresy and heretics. The institution to which this duty was confided\r\ntherefore enjoyed pre-eminence over all other departments of the State\r\nand the latter were bound, whenever called upon, to lend it whatever aid\r\nwas necessary. To refuse to assist it, to criticise it, or even to fail\r\nin demonstrations of due respect to those who performed its awful\r\nfunctions, were thus offences to be punished at its pleasure.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made (p. 182) to the oath required of\r\nofficials at the founding of the Inquisition, pledging obedience and\r\nassistance, whenever an inquisitor came to a place to set up his\r\ntribunal. This was not enough, for feudalism still disputed jurisdiction\r\nwith the crown, and the inquisitor was directed to summon the barons\r\nbefore him and make them take not only the popular oath but one\r\npromising to allow the Inquisition free course in their lands, failing\r\nwhich they were to be prosecuted as rebels.[869] As the tribunals became\r\nfixed in their several seats, when a new inquisitor came he brought\r\nroyal letters, addressed to all officials, from the viceroy down,\r\ncommanding them, under penalty of five thousand florins, to lend him and\r\nhis subordinates what aid was necessary and to obey his mandates in\r\nmaking arrests and executing his sentences, and this was published in a\r\nformal proclamation, with sound of trumpets, by the viceroy or other\r\nroyal representative.[870] This was not an empty formality. When, in\r\n1516, the Corregidor of Logroño, the Comendador Barrientos, a knight of\r\nSantiago, ventured to assert that the familiars were not to be assisted\r\nin making an arrest the inquisitors excommunicated him and ordered him\r\nto seek the inquisitor-general and beg for pardon, which was granted\r\nonly on condition of his appearance in a public auto de fe, after\r\nhearing mass as a penitent, on his knees and holding a candle, after\r\nwhich he was to be absolved with stripes and the other humiliations\r\ninflicted on penitents.[871] This was not merely an indignity but a\r\nlasting mark of infamy, extending to the kindred and posterity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OATHS OF OBEDIENCE_]\r\n\r\nAs though this were not sufficient, at a somewhat later period, the\r\nofficials of all cities where tribunals were established were required\r\nto take an elaborate oath to the inquisitors, in which they swore to\r\ncompel every one within their jurisdiction to hold the Catholic faith,\r\nto persecute all heretics and their adherents, to seize and bring them\r\nbefore the Inquisition and to denounce them, to commit no public office\r\nto such persons nor to any who were prohibited by the inquisitors, nor\r\nto receive them in their families; to guard all the pre-eminences,\r\nprivileges, exemptions and immunities of the inquisitors, their\r\nofficials and familiars; to execute all sentences pronounced by the\r\ninquisitors and to be obedient to God, to the Roman Church and to the\r\ninquisitors and their successors.[872] In this, the clause pledging\r\nobservance of the privileges and exemptions of the officials was highly\r\nimportant for, as we shall see hereafter, the privileges claimed by the\r\nInquisition were the source of perpetual and irritating quarrels with\r\nthe royal and local magistrates. It was an innovation of the middle of\r\nthe sixteenth century, for Prince Philip, in a letter of December 2,\r\n1553, to the tribunal of Valencia, says that he hears it requires the\r\nroyal officials to swear to maintain the privileges, usages and customs\r\nof the Inquisition; this he says is a novelty and, as he does not\r\napprove of innovations, he asks what authority it has for such\r\nrequirement. To this the answer was that every year, when the municipal\r\nofficials enter upon their duties, they come and take such an oath and\r\nthe records showed that this had been observed for a hundred years\r\nwithout contradiction. This seems to have silenced his objections and\r\nthe formula became general. The Valencia Concordia, or agreement of\r\n1554, simply provides that the secular magistrates shall take the\r\naccustomed oath and what that was is doubtless shown by the one taken,\r\nin 1626, by the _almotacen_, or sealer of weights and measures, when he\r\ncame to the Inquisition and swore on the cross and the gospels to\r\nobserve the articles customarily read to the royal officials and to\r\nguard the privileges of the Holy Office and defend it with all his\r\npower.[873]\r\n\r\nEven all this was insufficient to emphasize the universal subordination.\r\nAt all autos de fe, which were attended by the highest in the land as\r\nwell as by the lowest, and at the annual proclamation of the Edict of\r\nFaith, to which the whole population was summoned, a notary of the\r\nInquisition held up a cross and addressed the people: \"Raise your hands\r\nand let each one say that he swears by God and Santa Maria and this\r\ncross and the words of the holy gospels, that he will favor and defend\r\nand aid the holy Catholic faith and the holy Inquisition, its ministers\r\nand officials, and will manifest and make known each and every heretic,\r\nfautor, defender and receiver of heretics and all disturbers and\r\nimpeders of the Holy Office, and that he will not favor, or help, or\r\nconceal them but, as soon as he knows of them, he will denounce them to\r\nthe inquisitors; and if he does otherwise that God may treat him as\r\nthose who knowingly perjure themselves: Let every one say Amen!\"[874]\r\nWhen the sovereign was present at an auto this general oath did not\r\nsuffice and he took a special one. Thus, at the Valladolid auto of May\r\n21, 1559, the Inquisitor-general Valdés administered it to the Regent\r\nJuana and at that of Madrid, in 1632, Inquisitor-general Zapata went to\r\nthe window at which Philip IV was seated, with a missal and a cross, on\r\nwhich the king swore to protect and defend the Catholic faith as long as\r\nhe lived and to aid and support the Inquisition--an oath which was then\r\nduly read aloud to the people.[875] Thus the whole nation was bound, in\r\nthe most solemn manner, to be obedient to the Inquisition and to submit\r\nto what it might assert to be its privileges.\r\n\r\nHow purely ministerial were the functions of the public officials in all\r\nthat related to the Inquisition, even under Philip V, was illustrated\r\nwhen, at Barcelona, in an auto de fe, June 28, 1715, a bigamist named\r\nMedrano was sentenced to two hundred lashes to be inflicted on the 30th.\r\nOn the 29th word was sent to the public executioner to be ready to\r\nadminister them, but the Viceroy, the Marquis of Castel-Rodrigo, forbade\r\nthe executioner to act until he should give permission, holding that no\r\npublic punishment should be inflicted until he should be officially\r\nnotified of the sentence. There were hasty conferences and debates,\r\nlasting to nearly midnight, and it was not until 7 A.M. of the 30th that\r\nthe marquis gave way and the sentence was executed. The tribunal\r\nreported the affair to the Suprema, which replied in the name of the\r\nking, diplomatically thanking the marquis and rebuking his legal\r\nadviser, who was told that it was his duty and that of all officials to\r\nbe obedient to the Inquisition.[876]\r\n\r\nAs a perpetual reminder of this subordination, there appears to have\r\nbeen kept in the royal chancellery the formula of a letter addressed to\r\nall viceroys and captains-general. This recited the invaluable services\r\nof the Inquisition in clearing the land of infinite heretics and\r\npreserving it from the convulsions afflicting other nations, thus\r\nrendering its efficiency one of the chief concerns of the crown.\r\nTherefore the king charges his representatives emphatically to honor and\r\nfavor all inquisitors, officials and familiars, giving them all the\r\nnecessary aid for which they may ask and enforcing the observance of all\r\nthe privileges and exemptions conceded to them by law, concordias, royal\r\ncédulas, use and custom and in any other way, so that the Holy Office\r\nmay have the full liberty and authority which it has always enjoyed and\r\nwhich the king desires it to retain. A copy of this was sent to all the\r\nviceroys in 1603 and, as I have chanced to find it again addressed, in\r\n1652, to the Duke of Montalto, then Viceroy of Valencia, it was\r\npresumably part of the regular instructions furnished to all who were\r\nappointed to these responsible positions.[877]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _POWER TO CRIPPLE OPPONENTS_]\r\n\r\nIn the interminable conflicts through which the Inquisition established\r\nits enjoyment of the powers thus conferred, the inquisitor was armed,\r\noffensively and defensively, in a manner to give him every advantage. He\r\ncould, at any moment, when involved in a struggle with either the\r\nsecular or ecclesiastical authorities, disable his opponent with a\r\nsentence of excommunication removable only by the Holy Office or the\r\npope and, if this did not suffice, he could lay an interdict or even a\r\n_cessatio a divinis_ on cities, until the people, deprived of the\r\nsacraments, would compel submission. It is true that, in 1533, the\r\nSuprema ordered that much discretion should be exercised in the use of\r\nthis powerful weapon, on account of the indignation aroused by its\r\nabuse, but we shall have ample opportunity to see how recklessly it was\r\nemployed habitually, without regard to the preliminary safeguards\r\nimposed by the canons.[878] On the other hand, the inquisitor was\r\npractically immune. His antagonists were mostly secular authorities who\r\nhad no such weapon in their armories and, when he chanced to quarrel\r\nwith a prelate, he usually took care to be the first to fulminate an\r\nexcommunication, and then unconcernedly disregarded the counter censures\r\nas uttered by one disabled from the exercise of his functions, for the\r\nanathema deprived its subject of all official faculties. It had the\r\ncontingent result, moreover, that he who remained under excommunication\r\nfor a year could be prosecuted for suspicion of heresy.[879]\r\n\r\nThere was another provision which rendered it even more formidable as an\r\nantagonist. In matters of faith and all pertaining directly or\r\nindirectly thereto, its jurisdiction was exclusive. In the extensive\r\nfield of civil and criminal business, of which it obtained cognizance\r\nthrough the immunities of its officials and, in the frequent quarrels\r\narising from questions of ceremony and precedence, no court, whether\r\nsecular or spiritual, had power to inhibit any action which it might see\r\nfit to take. By special papal favor, however, it had power to inhibit\r\ntheir action and thus to cripple them on the spot. This extraordinary\r\nprivilege, with power to subdelegate, appears to have been first granted\r\nin the commissions issued, in 1507, to Ximenes and Enguera as\r\ninquisitors-general respectively of Castile and Aragon and was repeated\r\nin those of Luis Mercader and Pedro Juan Poul in 1513.[880] For a\r\nconsiderable time this clause disappears from the commissions, but,\r\ntowards the close of the century, it again finds place, in a more\r\ndetailed and absolute form in that granted to Manrique de Lara, after\r\nwhich it continued in those of his successors to the end. It confers the\r\npower of inhibiting all judges, even of archiepiscopal dignity, under\r\npecuniary penalties and censures to be enforced by the invocation of the\r\nsecular arm and of absolving them after they shall have submitted and\r\nobeyed.[881] This proclaimed to the world that the Inquisition outranked\r\nall other authorities in Church and State and the power was too often\r\nexercised for its existence to be ignored or forgotten. This superiority\r\nfound practical expression in the rule that, in the innumerable\r\nconflicts of jurisdiction, all secular and ecclesiastical judges must\r\nanswer communications from inquisitors in the form of petition and not\r\nby letter. If they replied to commands and comminations by letter they\r\nwere to be fined and proceedings were to be commenced against them and\r\ntheir messengers, and they were required to withdraw and erase from\r\ntheir records all such letters which were held to be disrespectful to\r\nthe superiority of the Holy Office.[882]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ASSERTION OF SUPERIORITY_]\r\n\r\nIt was an inevitable inference from this that there was no direct appeal\r\nfrom whatever a tribunal might do except to the Suprema, which, though\r\nit might in secret chide its subordinates for their excesses,\r\ncustomarily upheld them before the world. The sovereign, it is true, was\r\nthe ultimate judge and, in occasional cases, he interposed his authority\r\nwith more or less effect, but the ordinary process was through a\r\n_competencia_, a cumbrous procedure through which, as we shall see, the\r\nInquisition could wrangle for years and virtually, in most cases, deny\r\nall practical relief to the sufferers.\r\n\r\nAnother weapon of tremendous efficacy was the power of arrest, possessed\r\nat will by inquisitors during the greater portion of the career of the\r\nInquisition. Even to gratify mere vindictiveness, by simply asserting\r\nthat there was a matter of faith, the inquisitor could throw any one\r\ninto the secret prison. The civil magistrate might thus abuse his\r\nauthority with little damage to the victim, but it was otherwise with\r\nthe Inquisition. In the insane estimate placed on _limpieza de sangre_,\r\nor purity of blood, the career of a man and of his descendants was\r\nfatally narrowed by such a stain on his orthodoxy; it mattered little\r\nwhat was the outcome of the case, the fact of imprisonment was\r\nremembered and handed down through generations while the fact of its\r\nbeing causeless was forgotten. In the later period, when the Suprema\r\nsupervised every act of the tribunals, the opportunities for this were\r\ngreatly restricted, but during the more active times the ill-will of an\r\ninquisitor could at any moment inflict this most serious injury and the\r\npower was often recklessly abused in the perpetual conflicts with the\r\nsecular authorities. The ability thus to destroy at a word the prospects\r\nin life of any man was a terrible weapon which goes far to explain the\r\nawe with which the inquisitor was regarded by the community.\r\n\r\nThat the inquisitor should assume to be superior to all other\r\ndignitaries was the natural result of the powers thus concentrated in\r\nhim. Páramo asserts that he is the individual of highest authority in\r\nhis district, as he represents both pope and king; and the Suprema, in a\r\nconsulta addressed to Philip V, in 1713, boasted that its jurisdiction\r\nwas so superior that there was not a person in the kingdom exempt from\r\nit.[883] The haughty supremacy which it affected is seen in instructions\r\nissued in 1578 that inquisitors, when the tribunal is sitting, are not\r\nto go forth to receive any one, save the king, the queen or a royal\r\nprince and are not, in an official capacity, to appear in receptions of\r\nprelates or other public assemblies, and this was virtually repeated in\r\n1645, when they were told not to visit the viceroy or the archbishop or\r\naccept their invitations, for such demonstrations were due only to the\r\nperson of the king.[884] Exception however, was probably taken to this\r\nfor a _carta acordada_ of March 17, 1648, lays down less stringent rules\r\nand specifies for each tribunal, according to the varying customs of\r\ndifferent places, the high officials whom the inquisitor is permitted to\r\nvisit on induction into office and on occasions of condolence or\r\ncongratulation.[885]\r\n\r\nIn the social hierarchy the viceroys and captains-general stood next to\r\nthe king as representing, in their respective governments, the royal\r\nperson. To outrank these exalted personages was not beyond inquisitorial\r\nambition. In 1588 there was great scandal in Lima, when the inquisitors\r\nclaimed precedence over the Count of Villar, the Viceroy of Peru, and\r\ncarried their point by excommunicating him, but Philip II, in a cédula\r\nof March 8, 1589, took them severely to task for their arrogance and\r\nadded that the viceroy was equally to blame for yielding, as he\r\nrepresented the royal power. This lesson was ineffectual and some years\r\nlater another method was tried of asserting superiority. In 1596, the\r\nCaptain-general of Aragon complained to the king that, in the recent\r\nauto de fe, the inquisitors had refused to give him the title of\r\nExcellency. To this Philip replied, February 6, 1597, that it was\r\nunreasonable for them thus to affect equality with his personal\r\nrepresentative; they must either concede to him the title of Excellency\r\nor themselves be treated as _vuestra merced_, in place of _muy ilustres_\r\nor _señoria_, and therefore he could attend the next auto.[886]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ASSERTION OF SUPERIORITY_]\r\n\r\nThis asserted superiority of the Inquisition was very galling to the\r\nbishops, who argued that the Holy Office had been founded only four\r\nhundred years before, as an aid to their jurisdiction, and they resented\r\nbitterly the efforts of the resolute upstarts to claim higher privileges\r\nand precedence. The Inquisition, however, was an organized whole, with\r\nsharp and unsparing methods of enforcing its claims and protected in\r\nevery way from assault, while the episcopate was a scattered and\r\nunwieldy body, acting individually and, for the most part, powerless to\r\ndefend the officials, through whom it acted, from those who claimed that\r\neverything concerning themselves was a matter of faith of which they had\r\nexclusive cognizance. The serious conflicts over jurisdiction will be\r\nconsidered in a subsequent chapter; here we are concerned merely with\r\nquestions of etiquette and ceremonial. Seen through the perspective of\r\nthe centuries, these quarrels, which were conducted with frantic\r\neagerness, seem trivialities unworthy of record, but their significance\r\nwas momentous to the parties concerned, as they involved superiority and\r\ninferiority. The hundred years' quarrel over precedence in Rome, between\r\nthe ambassadors of France and Spain, which was not settled until 1661 by\r\nthe triumph of France, had a meaning beyond a mere question of ceremony.\r\nIn Spain these debates often filled the land with confusion. All parties\r\nwere tenacious of what they conceived to be their rights and were ready\r\nto explode in violence on the smallest provocation. The enormous mass of\r\nletters and papers concerning the seats and positions of the inquisitors\r\nand their officials at all public functions--whether seats should be\r\nchairs or benches and whether they were to have canopies, or cushions,\r\nor carpets, shows that these were regarded as matters of the highest\r\nmoment, giving rise to envenomed quarrels with the ecclesiastical and\r\nsecular dignitaries, requiring for their settlement the interposition of\r\nthe royal authority. The inquisitors were constantly arrogating to\r\nthemselves external marks of superiority and the others were disputing\r\nit with a vehemence that elevated the most trivial affairs into matters\r\nof national importance, and the attention of the king and the highest\r\nministers was diverted from affairs of state to pacify obscure quarrels\r\nin every corner of the land.\r\n\r\nIt would be futile to enter into the details of these multitudinous\r\nsquabbles, but one or two subjects in dispute may be mentioned to\r\nillustrate the ingenuity with which the Inquisition pushed its claims to\r\nsuperiority. Towards the middle of the seventeenth century it demanded\r\nthat, when there was an episcopal letter or mandate to be published in\r\nthe churches and also an edict or letter of the Inquisition, the latter\r\nshould have precedence in the reading. This was naturally regarded as an\r\neffort to show that the inquisitorial jurisdiction was superior to the\r\nepiscopal and it led to frequent scandals. In 1645, at Valencia, on\r\nPassion Sunday, a secretary of the tribunal endeavored to read letters\r\nof the inquisitors before one of the archbishop's, but, by the latter's\r\norder, the priest refused to give way, whereupon the inquisitors\r\narrested him: the matter was carried up to the king, who ordered the\r\npriest to be discharged in such wise that there should be no record of\r\nhis prosecution and that his good fame should be restored. Soon after\r\nthis, in Saragossa on a feast-day in the cathedral, a priest commenced\r\nto read an archiepiscopal letter, but before he had finished more than a\r\nfew lines, a secretary of the Inquisition mounted the other pulpit and\r\nbegan reading a letter of the Inquisition; the priest was so disturbed\r\nthat he stopped, whereupon the archbishop, Juan Cebrian, ordered his\r\narrest, but he pleaded his surprise and confusion and the archbishop\r\nrelented. In 1649 a more determined effort was made by the Saragossa\r\ntribunal. August 15th the parish priest of the cathedral read certain\r\narchiepiscopal letters at the accustomed time and was followed by the\r\nsecretary of the Inquisition with others of the inquisitors. Two days\r\nlater the priest was summoned before the tribunal and was made to swear\r\nsecrecy as to orders given to him. The result showed what were his\r\ninstructions, for the next Sunday, having archiepiscopal letters to\r\nread, he waited until the secretary read those of the inquisitors. Some\r\ndays later similar secret orders were given to the priest of Nuestra\r\nSeñora del Pilar and when, on October 11th, he commenced reading an\r\narchiepiscopal letter, an officer of the Inquisition seized him by the\r\narm and forced him to read first those of the tribunal. Archbishop\r\nCebrian addressed memorials to the king, September 7th and 21st and\r\nOctober 12th asking his protection to preserve the archiepiscopal\r\njurisdiction; the Council of Aragon presented a consulta supporting him,\r\non which the wearied monarch made an endorsement, deploring the evil\r\nresults of such conflicts and telling the Council to write to the\r\narchbishop not to proceed to extremities but to seek some adjustment\r\nsimilar to that by which, a short time before, Cardinal Moscoso in\r\nToledo had caused an inquisitorial letter to be read on a different day,\r\nto which the tribunal must be made to conform.[887]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ASSERTION OF SUPERIORITY_]\r\n\r\nThe persistence with which the Inquisition maintained any claim once\r\nadvanced is illustrated by its endeavor to introduce change in the\r\nritual of the mass favorable to its assumption of superiority. It was\r\nthe custom that the celebrant should make a bow to the bishop, if\r\npresent, and in his absence, to the Eucharist. In 1635, at Valladolid,\r\nthe inquisitors required that when the Edict of Faith was read the bow\r\nshould be made to them and, on the refusal of the officiating canon,\r\nthey arrested him and the dean who upheld him and held them under heavy\r\nbail. This aroused the whole city and brought a rebuke from the king,\r\nwho ordered them to discharge the bail and not to abuse their\r\njurisdiction. Unabashed by this the effort was made again at\r\nCompostella, in 1639, and duly resisted; the king was again obliged to\r\nexamine the question and, after consultation with learned men, decided\r\nthat the chapter was in the right and that the inquisitors had the\r\nalternative of absenting themselves from the reading. Two rebuffs such\r\nas this should have sufficed but, in 1643, after careful preparation,\r\nanother attempt was made at Córdova, which produced a fearful scandal.\r\nNeither side would yield; the services were interrupted; the inquisitors\r\nendeavored to excommunicate the canons, but the latter raised such a din\r\nwith howls and cries, the thunder of the organ, the clangor of bells and\r\nbreaking up the seats in the choir, that the fulmination could not be\r\nheard. Even the inquisitors shrank from the storm and left the church\r\namid hisses, with their caps pulled down to their eyes, but they lost no\r\ntime in commencing a prosecution of the canons, who appealed to the\r\nking, in a portentous document covering two hundred and fifty-six folio\r\npages. Philip and his advisers at the moment had ample occupation, what\r\nwith the dismissal of Olivares, the evil tidings from Rocroy and the\r\nrebellions in Catalonia and Portugal, but they had to turn aside to\r\nsettle this portentous quarrel. A royal letter of June 16, 1643, ordered\r\nthe inquisitors to restore to the canons certain properties which they\r\nhad seized and to remove the excommunications, while reference to\r\nsimilar decisions at Compostella, Granada and Cartagena shows how\r\nobstinate and repeated had been the effort of the Holy Office.\r\nNotwithstanding this the tribunal of Córdova refused obedience to the\r\nroyal mandate and a second letter, of September 28th from Saragossa,\r\nwhere Philip was directing the campaign against Catalonia, was required.\r\nThis was couched in peremptory terms; the excommunications must be\r\nremoved and, for the future, the Roman ceremonial must be observed,\r\nprescribing that in the absence of the bishop, the reverence must be\r\nmade to the sacrament.[888]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _QUESTIONS OF CEREMONY_]\r\n\r\nWhile thus steadily endeavoring to encroach on the rights of others, the\r\nInquisition was supersensitive as to anything that might be reckoned as\r\nan attempt by other bodies to assert superiority, and it vindicated what\r\nit held to be its rights with customary violence. When the funeral\r\nsolemnities of Queen Ana, of Austria were celebrated in Seville, in\r\n1580, a bitter quarrel about precedence in seats arose between the\r\ntribunal, the royal Audiencia or high court and the city authorities,\r\nwhen the former arbitrarily suspended the obsequies until consultation\r\ncould be had with Philip II, then in Lisbon, engaged in the absorption\r\nof Portugal. He regulated the position which each of the contending\r\nparties should occupy and the postponed honors were duly rendered.\r\nMatters remained quiescent until a similar function became necessary,\r\nafter the death of Philip in 1598. The city spent weeks in costly\r\npreparations and the catafalque erected in the cathedral was regarded as\r\nworthy of that magnificent building. November 29th was fixed for the\r\nceremonies; on the vigil, the regent, or president judge of the\r\nAudiencia, sent a chair from his house to the place assigned to him, but\r\nthe chapter protested so vigorously against the innovation that he was\r\nobliged to remove it. The following morning, when the various bodies\r\nentered the church at half-past nine, the benches assigned to the judges\r\nand their wives were seen to be draped in mourning. This was at once\r\nregarded as an effort on their part to establish pre-eminence and\r\nexcited great indignation. The services commenced and during the mass\r\nthe inquisitors sent word to the cabildo, or city magistracy, that it\r\nshould order the mourning removed. After some demur, the cabildo sent\r\nits procurador mayor, Pedro de Escobar, with a notary and some\r\nalguaziles to the Audiencia, bearing a message to the effect that if the\r\ndrapery were not removed, the inquisitors and the church authorities\r\nwere agreed that the ceremonies should be suspended. He was told not to\r\napproach and on persisting he and his followers were arrested and thrown\r\ninto the public gaol. The inquisitors then sent their secretary with a\r\nmessage, but he too was kept at a distance when he mounted the steps of\r\nthe catafalque and cried out that the tribunal excommunicated the three\r\njudges, Vallejo, Lorenzana and Guerra, if they did not depart. A second\r\ntime he came with a message, which he was not allowed to deliver, and\r\nagain he mounted the steps to declare all the judges excommunicated and\r\nthat they must leave the church in order that the services might\r\nproceed, for the presence of excommunicates was a bar to all public\r\nworship. This was repeated again by the fiscal, when the Audiencia drew\r\nup a paper declaring the acts of the tribunal to be null and void and\r\nordering it to remove the censure under pain of forfeiting citizenship\r\nand temporalities, but the scrivener sent to serve it was refused a\r\nhearing and on his persisting was threatened with the pillory. The\r\nalcalde of the city endeavored to calm the inquisitors, but Inquisitor\r\nZapata replied furiously that if St. Paul came from heaven and ordered\r\nthem to do otherwise they would refuse if it cost them their souls.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there were similar trouble and complications among the church\r\nauthorities. The vicar-general, Pedro Ramírez de Leon, ordered the\r\nservices resumed, under pain, for the dean and officiating priest, of\r\nexcommunication and of a thousand ducats; the precentor and canons\r\nappealed to the pope, but the vicar-general published them in the choir\r\nas excommunicates. The celebrant, Dr. Negron, was sought for, but he had\r\nprudently disappeared in the confusion and could not be found. It was\r\nnow half-past twelve and the canons sent word to the Audiencia that they\r\nwere going and it could go. To leave the church, however, would seem\r\nlike an admission by the judges that they were excommunicate and they\r\ngrimly kept their seats. The cabildo of the city and the tribunal were\r\nnot to be outdone and the three hostile groups sat glaring at each other\r\nuntil four o'clock, when the absurdity of the situation grew too strong\r\nand they silently departed. Meanwhile the candles had been burning until\r\nfive hundred ducats' worth of wax was uselessly consumed.\r\n\r\nSo complicated a quarrel could of course only be straightened out by the\r\nking to whom all parties promptly appealed. The judges proved that they\r\nhad not draped their benches as a sign of pre-eminence but had proposed\r\nthat the same be done by the cabildo and the tribunal. As far as regards\r\nthe latter, the royal decision was manifested in two cédulas of December\r\n22d. One of these told the inquisitors that they had exceeded their\r\njurisdiction in excommunicating the judges, whom they were to absolve\r\n_ad cautelam_ and they also had to pay for the wasted wax. The other\r\nominously ordered the inquisitors Blanco and Zapata to appear at the\r\ncourt within fifteen days and not to depart without licence. At the same\r\ntime, on December 21st the suspended obsequies were duly\r\ncelebrated.[889]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SUPERIORITY TO LAW_]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from these cases that the only appeal from inquisitorial\r\naggression lay to the king and that, even when the inquisitors were\r\nwholly in the wrong and the royal decision was against them, no steps\r\nwere taken to keep them within bounds for the future. The altered\r\nposition of the Holy Office under the Bourbons was therefore\r\nsignificantly indicated by a decision of Fernando VI in 1747. At the\r\ncelebration in Granada, on September 11th, of his accession, the\r\nchancillería, or great high court of New Castile, observed that the\r\narchbishop occupied a chair covered with taffety, outside of his window\r\noverlooking the plaza, and that the inquisitors had cushions on their\r\nwindow-sills. It sent messengers to request the removal of these symbols\r\nof pre-eminence and, on receiving a refusal in terms of scant respect,\r\nit stopped the second bull-fight and put an end to the ceremonies. The\r\nmatter was referred to the king, when the Suprema, in a memorial of\r\nsolemn earnestness, argued that the Inquisition had for centuries been\r\nin the uncontested enjoyment of the privilege of which it was now sought\r\nto be deprived. It was the highest tribunal, not only in Spain but in\r\nthe world, as it had charge of the true religion, which is the\r\nfoundation of all kingdoms and republics. The time had passed for this\r\nswelling self-assertion. Full discussion was devoted to the momentous\r\nquestion and, on October 3d, Fernando issued a decree which proclaimed\r\nto Spain that the Holy Office was no longer what it had been. This was\r\nto the effect that, as the chancillería represented the royal\r\njurisdiction, and thus indirectly the king himself, it was entitled to\r\npre-eminence in all such celebrations and in those of the royal chapel;\r\nit was justified in its action and thereafter no such signs of dignity\r\nas canopies, cushions, ceremonial chairs and the like should be used in\r\nits presence. In case of attempts to do so, one of the alcaldes del\r\ncrimen with his officers should remove them and punish any workmen in\r\nsetting them up.[890]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition and its members were protected in every way from\r\nsubjection to local laws and regulations. An edict of Charles V, in\r\n1523, forbade all municipalities or other bodies from adopting statutes\r\nwhich should in any way curtail their privileges or be adverse to them\r\nand, if any such should be attempted he declared them in advance to be\r\nnull and void.[891] This in fact, was only expressing and enforcing the\r\ncanon laws enacted in the frenzied efforts to suppress heresy in the\r\nthirteenth century and still in vigor. A constitution of Urban IV\r\n(1261-5) declares invalid the laws of any state or city which impede,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, the functions of the Inquisition, and the bishop\r\nor inquisitor is empowered to summon the ruler or magistrates to exhibit\r\nsuch statutes and compel him by censures to revoke or modify them.[892]\r\nWhile this was designed to prevent the crippling of the Inquisition by\r\nhostile legislation, it inferred a superiority to law and was construed\r\nin the most liberal way, as was seen in a struggle in Valencia which\r\nlasted for nearly two centuries. A police regulation for the improvement\r\nof the market-place ordered the removal of all stands for the display of\r\ngoods under the arcades of the houses. One house belonged to the\r\ntribunal; its tenant was the worst offender, and he obstinately kept his\r\nstand and appealed to the tribunal for protection against the law. This\r\nprotection was accorded with such vigor in 1603, that the saintly\r\nArchbishop, Juan de Ribera, who was also captain-general, vainly\r\nendeavored to secure obedience to the law. Until the close of the\r\neighteenth century the tribunal thus successfully defied the Real Junta\r\nde Policia, consisting of the captain-general, the regente and other\r\nhigh officials. At length, in 1783, Carlos III issued a royal\r\ndeclaration that no one should be exempt from obedience to orders of\r\npolice and good government and that all such cases should be adjudicated\r\nby the ordinary courts without admitting the _competencias_ with which\r\nthe Holy Office habitually sought to tire out those who ventured to\r\nwithstand its aggressiveness. Under this, in 1791, the nuisance in\r\nValencia was abated, when the tribunal apologized to the Suprema for\r\nyielding and excused itself in virtue of the royal declaration of 1783.\r\nIt had held out as long as it could, but times had changed and even the\r\nInquisition was forced to respect the law.[893] Madrid had been earlier\r\nrelieved from such annoyance, for a royal cédula of 1746, regulating the\r\npolice system of the capital, has a clause evidently directed at the\r\nInquisition for it declares that no exemption, even the most privileged,\r\nshall avail in matters concerning the police, the adornment and the\r\ncleanliness of the city.[894]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INVIOLABILITY_]\r\n\r\nThe lawlessness thus fostered degenerated into an arbitrary disregard of\r\nthe rights of others, leading to a petty tyranny sometimes exercised in\r\nthe most arbitrary and capricious manner. Inquisitor Santos of Saragossa\r\nwas very friendly with the Licenciado Pedro de Sola, a beneficed priest\r\nof the cathedral, and Juan Sebastian, who were good musicians and who\r\ngathered some musical friends to sing complins with them on Holy\r\nSaturday at Santa Engracia, where the inquisitors spent Holy Week in\r\nretreat. Santos used to send his coach for them and entertain them\r\nhandsomely, but when, in 1624, he became Bishop of Solsona, although the\r\nsinging continued, the coach and entertainment ceased and the musicians\r\nwent unwillingly. Finally, in 1637, some of them stopped going; the\r\ninquisitors sent for them and scolded them which made them all\r\nindignant. Then, in 1638, the secretary Heredia was sent to order them\r\nto go and when the chapel master excused them, with an intimation that\r\nthey ought to be paid, Heredia told them the tribunal honored them\r\nsufficiently in calling for them. They did not go and, when Easter was\r\nover, two of them, beneficed priests, were summoned and, after being\r\nkept waiting for three hours, were imprisoned in a filthy little house\r\noccupied by soldiers and were left for twelve hours without bedding,\r\nfood or drink. The next day they managed to communicate with the\r\nchapter, but it was afraid to interfere and, after six days of this\r\nconfinement, they were brought before the tribunal and informed that\r\nthey had the city for a prison, under pain of a hundred ducats, and were\r\nmade to swear to present themselves whenever summoned. As they went out\r\nthey saw two more brought in--the chapel-master and a priest. At last\r\nthe chapter plucked up courage to address a memorial to the king\r\nthrough the Council of Aragon, which added the suggestion that he should\r\norder the inquisitor-general to see to the release of the musicians and\r\nthe prevention of such extortion. May 11th Philip referred this to the\r\nSuprema which, after a month's delay, replied, June 14th, that, desiring\r\nto avoid controversy with the church of Saragossa, it had ordered the\r\ntribunal to pay the musicians in future, to release any that were in\r\nprison and to return whatever fines had been imposed.[895] When petty\r\ntyranny such as this could be practised, especially on the privileged\r\nclass of priests, we can appreciate the terrorism surrounding the\r\ntribunals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother distinction contributed to the supereminence claimed by the\r\nInquisition--the inviolability which shielded all who were in its\r\nservice. From an early period the Church had sought to protect its\r\nmembers, whose profession was assumed to debar them from the use of\r\narms, by investing them with a sanctity which should assure their safety\r\nin an age of violence. Throughout the middle ages no canon was more\r\nfrequently invoked than _Si quis suadente diabolo_, which provided that\r\nwhoever struck a cleric or monk incurred an anathema removable only by\r\npersonal appearance before the pope and accepting his sentence.[896]\r\nMore than this was asked for by the Inquisition, for the greater portion\r\nof its officials were laymen. They were no more exposed to injury or\r\ninsult than those of the secular courts, but it was assumed that there\r\nwas a peculiar hatred felt for them and that their functions in\r\ndefending the faith entitled them to special security. We shall see\r\nhereafter that the Inquisition obtained jurisdiction in all matters\r\nconnected with its officials, but this, while enabling it to give them\r\nspecial protection, had the limitation that judgements of blood rendered\r\necclesiastics pronouncing them \"irregular.\" In cases of heresy this had\r\nlong been evaded by a hypocritical plea for mercy, when delivering\r\nconvicts to the secular arm for execution, but it was felt that some\r\nspecial faculties were requisite in dealing with cases of mere assault\r\nor homicide and a _motu proprio_ was procured from Leo X, January 28,\r\n1515, empowering inquisitors to arrest any one, even of the highest\r\nrank, whether lay or clerical, who strikes, beats, mutilates or kills\r\nany minister or official of the Inquisition and to deliver him to the\r\nsecular arm for punishment, without incurring irregularity, even if it\r\nresults in effusion of blood.[897] The Holy Office thus held in its own\r\nhands the protection of all who served it.\r\n\r\nThis was rendered still more efficient by subsequent papal action.\r\nIrritated at some resistance offered to the Roman Inquisition, Pius V\r\npublished, April 1, 1569, the ferocious bull _Si de protegendis_, under\r\nwhich any one, of whatever rank, who should threaten, strike or kill an\r\nofficer or a witness, who should help a prisoner to escape or make way\r\nwith any document or should lend aid or counsel to such act, was to be\r\ndelivered to the secular judge for punishment as a heretic--that is to\r\nsay, for burning--including confiscation and the infamy of his\r\nchildren.[898] Although this was intended for Italy, the Spanish\r\nInquisition speedily assumed the benefit of it; it was sent out October\r\n16th and it was annually published in the vernacular on Holy\r\nThursday.[899]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INVIOLABILITY_]\r\n\r\nThus all concerned in the business of the Holy Office were hedged around\r\nwith an inviolability accorded to no other class of the community. The\r\ninquisitors themselves were additionally protected against\r\nresponsibility for their own malfeasance by the received theory that\r\nscandal was more to be dreaded than crime--that there was inherent in\r\ntheir office such importance to religion that anything was better than\r\nwhat might bring that office into contempt. Francisco Peña, in treating\r\nof this, quotes the warning of Aquinas as to cardinals and applies it to\r\nthe punishment of inquisitors; if scandal has arisen, they may be\r\npunished; otherwise the danger to the reputation of the Holy Office is\r\ngreater than that of impunity to the offender.[900] The tenderness, in\r\nfact, with which they were treated, even when scandal had arisen, was a\r\nscandal in itself. Thus, when the reiterated complaints of Barcelona\r\ncaused a visitation to be made there, in 1567, by de Soto Salazar, and\r\nhis report confirmed the accusations, showing the three inquisitors to\r\nbe corrupt, extortionate and unjust, the only penalty imposed, in 1568,\r\nwas merely suspension for three years from all office in the\r\nInquisition. Even this was not enforced, at least with regard to one of\r\nthem, Dr. Zurita, for we chance to meet him as inquisitor of Saragossa\r\nin 1570. He does not seem to have reformed, for his transfer thence to\r\nSardinia, the least desirable of the tribunals, can only have been in\r\nconsequence of persistent misconduct.[901] The tribunals naturally\r\nshowed the same mercy to their subordinates, whose sole judges they\r\nwere, and this retention in office of those whom unfitness was proved\r\nwas not the least of the burdens with which the Inquisition afflicted\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nWhat rendered this inviolability more aggravating was that it extended\r\nto the servants and slaves of all connected with the Holy Office. About\r\n1540 a deputy corregidor of Murcia, for insulting a servant of the\r\nmessenger of the tribunal, was exposed to the infamy of hearing mass as\r\na penitent.[902] In 1564, we find Dr. Zurita, on circuit through his\r\ndistrict, collecting evidence against Micael Bonet, of Palacio de Vicio,\r\nfor caning a servant boy of Benet Modaguer, who held some office in the\r\nInquisition, and the case was sent to Barcelona for trial, which shows\r\nthat it was regarded as serious. So, in 1568, for quarrelling with a\r\nservant of Micer Complada, who styled himself deputy of the abogado\r\nfiscal at Tarragona, the Barcelona tribunal, without verifying\r\nComplada's claims to office, threw into prison Gerónimo Zapata and\r\nAntonio de Urgel and condemned Zapata to a fine of thirty ducats and six\r\nmonths' exile and Urgel to ten ducats and three months.[903] In Murcia,\r\nSebastian Gallego, the servant of an inquisitor, quarrelled with a\r\nbutcher over some meat, when they exchanged insults. The secular judge\r\narrested both but the tribunal claimed them, prosecuted the butcher and\r\nbanished him from the town.[904] Such cases were of frequent occurrence\r\nand it is easy to conceive how galling was the insolence of despised\r\nclass thus enabled to repay the contempt with which it was habitually\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ENFORCEMENT OF RESPECT_]\r\n\r\nWhen the honor of slaves was thus vindicated inquisitors were not apt to\r\ncondone any failure, real or imaginary, in the respect which they held\r\nto be their due, and the offender was made to feel the awful authority\r\nwhich shrouded the tribunal and its judges. As their powers were largely\r\ndiscretional, with undefined limits, the manner in which they were\r\nexercised was sometimes eccentric. In 1569, for instance, the Jesuits of\r\nPalermo prepared for representation in their church a tragedy of St.\r\nCatherine and, on October 4th, they gave a private rehearsal to which\r\nwere invited the viceroy and principal dignitaries. The inquisitor, Juan\r\nBiserra, came as one of the guests and finding the door closed knocked\r\nrepeatedly without announcing himself or demanding admittance. The\r\njanitor, thinking it to be some unauthorized person, paid no attention\r\nto the knocking and Biserra departed, highly incensed. When the Jesuits\r\nheard of it, the rector and principal fathers called on him to\r\napologize, but, after keeping them waiting for some time he refused to\r\nsee them. The public representation was announced for October 8th; the\r\nchurch was crowded with the nobility awaiting the rising of the curtain,\r\nwhen a messenger from Biserra notified the Jesuits that he forbade the\r\nperformance, under pain of excommunication and other penalties at his\r\ndiscretion, until after the piece should have been examined and approved\r\nby him. The audience was dismissed and the next day the MS. was sent to\r\nBiserra who submitted it to Dominican censors. Although they returned it\r\nwith their approval he discovered in it two objectionable points, so\r\nabsurdly trifling as to show that he wanted merely to make a wanton\r\nexhibition of his power. The censors replied to his criticism and he\r\nfinally allowed the performance to proceed. We may not unreasonably\r\nassume that this may have been one of the freaks for which Biserra was\r\nsuspended in 1572, on the report made of him by the visitor Quintanilla.\r\nThen, with customary tenderness, he was employed in the responsible\r\npost of visitor at Barcelona, where he died soon afterwards.[905]\r\n\r\nThe sensitiveness to disrespect and the terrorism which its arbitrary\r\npunishment diffused through the community were well illustrated when, in\r\n1617, Fray Diego Vinegas preached the Lenten sermons in the Hospital of\r\nN. Señora de la Gracia of Saragossa. He was a distinguished Benedictine,\r\nwho had held high offices in his Order, and his eloquence on this\r\noccasion brought in alms amounting to eight thousand crowns. On January\r\n21st the inquisitors sent him a message to come to them the next day at\r\n2 P.M., to which he replied in writing that he was indisposed and\r\nclosely occupied with his sermons; if they wished to order him to preach\r\nthe Edict of Faith, he held himself already charged to do so and begged\r\nthem to excuse his coming. A second message the same day told him to\r\ncome at the same hour another day, when he would be told what was wanted\r\nof him, to which he answered that he would come but that if it was only\r\nto order him to preach the sermon he would return at once to Castile,\r\nwithout again mounting the pulpit. Whether anything underlay this\r\nsomewhat mysterious action does not appear; the significance of the\r\naffair lies in the fact that it at once became a matter of general\r\npublic concern. When that same night the governor of the Hospital heard\r\nof it he recognized the injury that would accrue to the institution and\r\nto the whole city and forthwith reported it to the viceroy, who\r\ncommissioned the Licentiate Balthasar Navarro to undo the mischief. The\r\nresult of his labors was that the inquisitors declared that as Fray\r\nVinegas pleaded indisposition they would excuse him from preaching the\r\nEdict of Faith. The affair appeared to be settled and Vinegas begged\r\npermission to call on the two inquisitors, Santos and Salcedo, and pay\r\nthem the Easter compliments. They graciously acceded and on Easter\r\nMonday he waited on them, exculpated himself, and begged their pardon\r\nfor having been prevented by indisposition from preaching the Edict, all\r\nof which they accepted with great courtesy. The community breathed\r\nfreer, for some vindication of the honor of the Inquisition had been\r\nexpected. The inquisitors however had been consulting the Suprema and\r\nvengeance was at hand. The next day, Tuesday, was the last of the\r\nseries of sermons; Vinegas preached successfully to a crowded church\r\nwhen, on descending from the pulpit, he was arrested by an alguazil of\r\nthe Inquisition, dragged through the crowd like a heresiarch attempting\r\nescape, thrown into a coach and carried to the Aljafería. There he was\r\nplaced on a bench like a criminal, interrogated as one and then, without\r\nbeing listened to, was sentenced to perpetual deprivation of the honors\r\nof the Inquisition (preaching at autos, the edicts, etc.) and\r\nreprimanded with the utmost severity. The mark of infamy thus inflicted\r\nwas indelible and the scandal was immense. The people flocked in crowds\r\nto the viceroy in the greatest excitement and he had much ado to quiet\r\nthem by promising that it should be remedied. Vinegas applied for the\r\nreinstatement of his honor to the Council of Aragon, which replied that\r\nit had no jurisdiction; then he applied to the Suprema, which refused to\r\nhear him. He sent a memorial to the king, who referred it to the Council\r\nof Aragon and he continued his efforts for more than a year but it does\r\nnot appear that he ever obtained relief.[906]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ENFORCEMENT OF RESPECT_]\r\n\r\nAs a rule, any criticism of the justice of the Inquisition and any\r\ncomplaint by one who had passed through its hands were offences to be\r\npunished with more or less severity. To this, however, there was an\r\nexception in a case the singularity of which deserves mention. Perhaps\r\nthe most distinguished Franciscan theologian of his day was Miguel de\r\nMedina. He fell under suspicion of Lutheranism, was arrested and tried\r\nand died during trial, May 1, 1578, in the secret prison of Toledo after\r\nfour years of detention. Another Franciscan, Francisco Ortiz, espoused\r\nhis cause so zealously that, in a public sermon in 1576 he pronounced\r\nthe trial to be unjust, for it was the work of a conspiracy among his\r\nbrother frailes; the arrest was a mortal sin, as though it were St.\r\nJerome or St. Augustin, and the inquisitor-general (Espinosa) who had\r\nsigned the warrant was in hell unless he had repented; the inquisitors\r\nwere ashamed and were seeking to avert the disgrace from themselves,\r\nwhen they ought to be punishing the perjury of those who had testified.\r\nThis was flat blasphemy against the Holy Office, and it is not easy to\r\nunderstand why the daring fraile escaped, when tried by the tribunal of\r\nToledo, with a reprimand administered privately in the audience-chamber\r\nand a prohibition to enter Madrid without permission--a sentence which\r\nwas duly confirmed by the Suprema.[907] We shall see hereafter that\r\nanother Fray Francisco Ortiz, for a similar offence, did not escape so\r\neasily.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese were the defences thrown around the Inquisition to secure its\r\neffectiveness in its supreme function of maintaining religious unity,\r\nand these were the efforts which it made to secure the recognition of\r\nthe supremacy to which it aspired. It was an institution suddenly\r\nintroduced into an established ecclesiastical and secular hierarchy,\r\nwhich regarded the intruder with natural jealousy and dislike and\r\nresented its manifest resolve to use its spiritual authority for their\r\nhumiliation. Its arrogant self-assertion led it into frequent mistakes\r\nin which even its royal protectors could not justify it, but it\r\ngradually won its way under the Hapsburgs. The advent of the Bourbons\r\nbrought into play a new theory as to the relations between Church and\r\nState and the civil authorities were able in time to vindicate their\r\nequality and independence. We shall have the opportunity of following\r\nthis struggle, in which religion was in no way concerned, for the\r\ndefence of the faith was a pretext under which the Holy Office sought to\r\narrogate to itself control over a constantly widening area of secular\r\naffairs, while claiming release from secular obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGES AND EXEMPTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution introduced the theory of equality, class\r\nprivileges were the rule. The public burdens were eluded by those best\r\nable to bear them and were accumulated on the toilers. The mortmain\r\nlands held by the Church were exempt from both taxation and military\r\nservice and, though Philip V, in the Concordat of 1737, obtained the\r\nprivilege of taxing such as might subsequently be acquired, the repeated\r\ndecrees for its enforcement show the impossibility of enforcing it.[908]\r\nThe complete immunity of ecclesiastics from taxation was emphatically\r\nasserted by Boniface VIII in the bull _Clericis laicos_ and, although\r\nthis was revoked by the Council of Vienne in 1312, care was taken to\r\nenunciate the principle as still in vigor.[909] Yet in the kingdoms of\r\nAragon they were subject to all imposts on sales, to import and export\r\ndues and other local taxation and, when resistance was offered to this,\r\nCharles V procured from Adrian VI, in 1522, and from Clement VII, in\r\n1524, briefs confirming their liability.[910] _Hidalguia_, or gentle\r\nblood, conferred a multiplicity of privileges, including exemption from\r\ntaxation, royal and local, with certain exceptions that were largely\r\nevaded, and the _labrador_--the peasant or commoner--was distinctively\r\nknown as a _pechero_ or tax-payer.[911] That in such a social order the\r\nInquisition should seek for its members all the exemptions that it could\r\ngrasp was too natural to excite surprise, though it might occasionally\r\nprovoke resistance.\r\n\r\nAs regards freedom from taxation, the subject is complicated by\r\nquestions concerning royal and local imposts, by the varying customs in\r\nthe different provinces, and by the distinction between the active\r\nofficials of the tribunals, known as _titulados y asalaridos_, and the\r\nmore numerous unsalaried ones, who were only called upon occasionally\r\nfor service, such as familiars, commissioners, notaries, consultors and\r\ncensors. Their rights were loosely defined and were subject to perpetual\r\nvariation by conflicting decisions in the contests that were constantly\r\noccurring with the secular authorities, provoked by habitual antagonism\r\nand the frequent imposition of new taxes, raising new questions.\r\nFerdinand wrote sharply, April 13, 1504, to the town-council of\r\nBarcelona, when it attempted to subject the officials of the tribunal to\r\nthe burdens borne by other citizens, in violation of the pre-eminences\r\nand exemptions of the Holy Office, and he warned them to desist, in view\r\nof the judicial measures that would be taken. Yet, in 1508, we find him\r\nwriting still more sharply to that tribunal, scolding it because it had\r\ntaken from the house of the alguazil of the Bailía a female slave and,\r\nwithout waiting for formal judgement, had sold her without paying the\r\nroyal impost of twenty per cent., a disregard of the regalías not\r\npermitted to them. They had also issued an order on the custom-house to\r\npass free of duty certain articles for an inquisitor, which was against\r\nall rule for, even if the goods were needed for the support of the\r\nofficials, it was a matter for the farmers of the revenue to decide, and\r\nthe issuing of such passes would be fruitful of fraud and loss.[912]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TAXATION_]\r\n\r\nThese instances indicate the uncertainties of the questions that were\r\nconstantly arising in the intricate system--or lack of system--of\r\nSpanish taxation. To follow the subject in detail would be an endless\r\nand unprofitable task. I have collected a considerable number of more or\r\nless contradictory decisions of this early period, but the only\r\ndeductions to be drawn from them are the indefiniteness of the exemption\r\nand the earnestness of the effort made to extend it by the Inquisition.\r\nThe matter evidently was one in which there were no recognized rules\r\nand, in 1568, Philip II undertook to regulate it, at least in so far as\r\nconcerned royal taxation. He defined for each tribunal the officials who\r\nwere to be exempted from all taxes, excise and assessments, and forbade\r\ntheir exaction under pain of fifty thousand maravedís and punishment at\r\nthe royal discretion, but this exemption was granted only during his\r\ngood pleasure, so that he retained full control and admitted no\r\nprivilege as inherent in the Inquisition. His enumeration moreover\r\ncomprised only the _titulados y asalariados_, holding commissions from\r\nthe Suprema and in constant service, and omitted the familiars and\r\nothers who greatly exceeded them in numbers.[913]\r\n\r\nThis attempt at settlement left the matter still undefined and\r\nprovocative of endless strife. It said nothing as to local taxes; these\r\nand the royal taxes were often indistinguishable, or so combined that\r\nthey could not be separated; the unsalaried officials were not\r\nspecifically declared to be taxable and were always striving for\r\nexemption, and when, in the growing needs of the monarchy, new taxes\r\nwere imposed, there came ever fresh struggles conducted with the\r\ncustomary violence of the Inquisition. May 10, 1632, the Royal Council\r\nearnestly represented to Philip IV that it had already laid before him\r\ncertain excesses of the inquisitors of Cuenca to which he had not seen\r\nfit to reply. Now the corregidor of Cuenca has reported other excesses\r\nrequiring immediate remedy, for they have issued an order, under pain of\r\nexcommunication and other penalties, that the collector of the excise on\r\nwine, imposed for the pay of the troops, shall not collect it of the\r\nsalaried officials of the tribunal although they are laymen and subject\r\nto it. They pretended that they were not liable to the alcavala (tax on\r\nsales) but they were defeated in the suit on this before the Council of\r\nHacienda. And if this is permitted all the other tribunals will attempt\r\nthe same, and with their exemption will come that of their servants and\r\nkindred and connections of all kinds, with frauds and concealment as\r\nusual, resulting in increase of charge to other vassals and damage to\r\nthe treasury, for it seems as though the sole object of the inquisitors\r\nis to diminish the royal patrimony.[914] Similar troubles attended the\r\nlevying of the _servicio de millones_, an exceedingly unpopular impost\r\non wine, meat, vinegar and other necessaries.[915]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TAXATION_]\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1631, the tax of _media añata_, or half a year's salary levied\r\non appointees to office, was imposed there was a discussion as to\r\nwhether it was applicable to the Inquisition. This was settled in the\r\naffirmative and the Suprema made no objection, for its collection was\r\ntaken from the _Sala de Media Añata_ and was given to Gabriel Ortiz de\r\nSotomayor, appointed by Inquisitor-general Zapata and when he, in the\r\ncourse of a few years, became Bishop of Badajoz, the business was\r\nintrusted to the inquisitor-general himself. For awhile the payments\r\nwere made with some regularity, but, in 1650, an investigation showed\r\nthat for a long while it had been quietly allowed to drop and, as it was\r\nin the hands of the inquisitor-general, there were no means of enforcing\r\nan accounting. For a year Arce y Reynoso eluded the efforts of the Sala\r\nde Media Añata to obtain information and finally, May 17, 1651, the king\r\nordered him peremptorily to pay his own media añata (due since 1643), to\r\nmake the other officials do so and to furnish the required information\r\nto the Sala. On receiving this he said there were difficulties in making\r\necclesiastics like inquisitors pay, but he would consult the Suprema and\r\nreply in July. July passed away and the Sala again applied to him, when\r\nhe replied that, as concerned the familiars and other secular officials,\r\norders had already been given and collections made, but as to clerics\r\nthere were scruples about which he would advise with the king. He failed\r\nto do so and in October the king was urged to repeat his demand for\r\nimmediate payment. The outcome of the affair was that ecclesiastics were\r\nexempted and laymen had to pay, while familiars, who had no salaries,\r\nwere assessed nine ducats--so Arce y Reynoso succeeded in eluding his\r\ntax. Collection, moreover, from the laymen was not easy and, January 28,\r\n1654, the Suprema issued general instructions to deduct it without\r\nexception from the salaries. This only transferred the indebtedness from\r\nthe individuals to the receivers or treasurers of the tribunals, who\r\nseem to have been equally slow to pay and, in 1655, an inquisitor in\r\neach tribunal of Castile and the colonies was designated to collect the\r\nmoney from the treasurer and remit it at once.[916] It is safe to assume\r\nthat the receipts were trivial and the whole business affords an\r\nillustration of the methods by which the revenues of Spain were\r\nfrittered away before reaching the treasury. Whether productive or not,\r\nhowever, the media añata remained until the end a permanent charge upon\r\nthe lay officials. In Valencia, in 1790, it had for ten years amounted\r\nto an annual average of ten libras.[917]\r\n\r\nWith regard to local taxation, contests were renewed at every new impost\r\nwith varying success, and a single case will elucidate the character of\r\nthese struggles. In 1645 the Córtes of Valencia agreed to furnish for\r\nsix years twelve hundred men to garrison Tortosa, reserving the right to\r\nimpose whatever duties or excise might be necessary to defray the\r\nexpense. In order that the clergy might be included the assent of\r\nArchbishop Aliaga was sought, which he granted with difficulty and only\r\non condition that, within eight months, a confirmatory papal brief\r\nshould be obtained, which was duly accomplished. To meet the charge an\r\nexcise, known as the _sisa del corte_ was levied on all goods cut for\r\ngarments. The tribunal refused to submit to this and pointed to its\r\ncontributions to a loan of twenty thousand ducats made by the\r\nInquisition to the king in 1642, and to its payment since 1643 of five\r\nper cent. of the salaries for the maintenance of certain mounted men.\r\nThe city yielded for a while and then a compromise was made; the\r\necclesiastics at the time were paying eighteen deniers on the libra\r\n(7-1/2 per cent.) while the officials of the tribunal were to be taxed\r\nonly six deniers (2-1/2 per cent.). To maintain their principle of\r\nexemption, however, for some years they had their garments made in the\r\nname of other ecclesiastics and paid the eighteen deniers, but in 1659\r\nthey grew tired of this and paid the six deniers for themselves, first\r\nregistering a protest that it was without prejudice to their privileges\r\nand exemptions. This continued until 1668, when suddenly, on June 19th,\r\nthe fiscal of the tribunal summoned the collectors of the _sisa del\r\ncorte_ to pass freely, within twenty-four hours, the cloth cut for the\r\ngarments of Benito Sanguino, the alcalde mayor, under pain of five\r\nhundred ducats. On the 21st the syndics of the city and the collectors\r\ninterjected an appeal to the king, in spite of which the next day the\r\nmandate was repeated, this time giving twelve hours for obedience and\r\nadding excommunication to the fine. Another appeal was interposed and\r\nthe regent of the Audiencia applied for a _competencia_, or orderly\r\nmethod of settling disputes, as provided in the Concordia, but\r\nnotwithstanding this the next day the excommunications were published\r\nand the names of the collectors were affixed to the doors of the\r\ncathedral as under the anathema of the Church.[918] The final outcome is\r\nof little moment; the interest of the affair lies in its illustration of\r\nthe persistence of the Inquisition and the violence of its methods.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the case is not exceptional. The formularies of the\r\nInquisition contained a full assortment of arbitrary mandates which it\r\nemployed, in place of seeking the legal courses prescribed in the\r\nConcordias, by which the king and the Córtes sought to preserve the\r\npeace. One of these, drawn in the name of the tribunal of Llerena,\r\naddressed to the governor and magistrates, recites that complaint has\r\nbeen made of the imposition on officials and familiars of a new octroi\r\non meat and proceeds to assert that, by immemorial custom and royal\r\ncédulas, the commissioned officials are exempted from paying any taxes,\r\nexcise, imposts and assessments, whether royal or local or otherwise;\r\nthe magistrates are commanded within two hours to desist from the\r\nattempt, under pain of major excommunication and a fine of a hundred\r\nthousand maravedís for the governor or his deputy and of fifty thousand\r\nfor subordinates, with the threat, in case of disobedience, of\r\nprosecution with the full rigor of law. Moreover the secretary or notary\r\nof the city is ordered within the two hours to bring to the tribunal and\r\nsurrender all papers concerning the assessment on the officials, under\r\npain of excommunication and ten thousand maravedís.[919] Such were the\r\nperemptory commands habitually employed, the arrogance of which rendered\r\nthem especially galling.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TAXATION_]\r\n\r\nNot only were these fulminations ready for use when the case occurred,\r\nbut there were formulas drawn up in advance to prevent any attempted\r\ninfraction of the privileges claimed by the officials. Thus this same\r\ncollection has one addressed to the corregidor and magistrates of a town\r\nwhere a fair is to be held, reciting that an official of the tribunal\r\nproposes to send thither a certain number of cattle bearing his brand,\r\nwhich he swears to be of his own raising and, as he is exempt from\r\npaying alcavala, tolls, ferriages, royal servicio and all other\r\nassessments and dues and, as he fears that there may be an attempt to\r\nimpose them, therefore all officials and collectors are ordered, under\r\npain of major excommunication and two hundred ducats, to abstain from\r\nall such attempts, with threats of further punishment in case of\r\ndisobedience.[920] The enormous advantage which the official thus\r\npossessed is plain, as well as the door which it opened to fraud. That\r\nthe claim was groundless appears by a memorial presented to the Suprema\r\nin 1623, in response to a call by Inquisitor-general Pacheco on his\r\ncolleagues for suggestions as to the better government and improvement\r\nof the Inquisition--a remarkable paper to which reference will\r\nfrequently be made hereafter. On this point it states that, in some\r\ntribunals, the officials are exempted from paying the alcavala on the\r\nproducts of their estates, while in others they are not. In some, a\r\nportion of the officials have dexterously secured exemption, while\r\nothers have been compelled to pay, by judicial decision, as there is no\r\nbasis for such claims. If there is no right or privilege of exemption,\r\nit is not seen how the officials can conscientiously escape payment, or\r\nhow the inquisitors can defend them in evading it, besides the numerous\r\nsuits thence arising which occupy the time of the tribunals. To cure\r\nthis it is suggested that the king grant exemptions to all, for there\r\nare not more than two or three in each tribunal to be thus\r\nbenefited.[921] This suggestion was not adopted, but the claim was\r\npersisted in with its perpetual exasperation and multiplicity of\r\nlitigation.\r\n\r\nThe large numbers of the unsalaried officials, especially the familiars,\r\nrendered the question of their exemption of considerably greater\r\nimportance. They had no claim to it, but they were persistently\r\nendeavoring to establish the right and for the most part they were\r\nsupported by the tribunals in the customary arbitrary fashion. In the\r\nfutile Concordia of Catalonia in 1599, it was provided that levies and\r\nexecutions for all taxes and imposts could be made on familiars and\r\ncommissioners by the ordinary officers of justice. In the memorial to\r\nClement VIII asking for the disallowance of this Concordia, the Suprema\r\nproved learnedly, by a series of canons from the fourth Council of\r\nLateran down, that the cruce-signati (whom it claimed to correspond with\r\nthe modern familiars) were exempt. It even had the audacity to cite the\r\nConcordia of 1514, which in reality denied their exemption, and it\r\nassumed with equal untruth that this was the universal custom in\r\nSpain.[922] Yet, in a consulta of December 30, 1633, the Suprema tacitly\r\nexcluded the unsalaried officials when it argued that there were not,\r\nexclusive of ecclesiastics, more than two hundred officials in Spain\r\nentitled to the exemption.[923]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TAXATION_]\r\n\r\nStill, the Inquisition fought the battle for the unsalaried officials\r\nwith as much vigor as for the salaried. In 1634 the levying of a few\r\nreales on a familiar of Vicalvero, on the occasion of the voyage to\r\nBarcelona of the Infante Fernando, was resisted with such violence by\r\nthe tribunal of Toledo, that finally the king had to intervene,\r\nresulting in the banishment and deprival of temporalities of a clerical\r\nofficial and the summoning to court of the senior inquisitor.[924] In\r\n1636, Philip IV, to meet the extravagant outlays on the palace of Buen\r\nRetiro, levied a special tax on all the towns of the district of Madrid.\r\nIn Vallecas the quota was assessed on the inhabitants, among whom was a\r\nfamiliar who refused to pay, when the local alcaldes levied upon his\r\nproperty. He appealed to the Suprema which referred the matter to the\r\ntribunal of Toledo and it arrested the alcaldes and condemned them in\r\nheavy penalties. Then the Alcaldes de Casa y Corte, the highest criminal\r\ncourt, intervened and arrested the familiar, whereupon the Suprema twice\r\nsent to the _Sala de los Alcaldes_, declaring them to be excommunicated,\r\nbut the bearer of the censure was refused audience. On this the Suprema,\r\nwith the assent of the Council of Castile, sent a cleric to arrest the\r\nalcaldes and convey them out of the kingdom, and on March 12th, in all\r\nthe churches of Madrid, they were published as excommunicate and subject\r\nto all the penalties of the bull _in Coena Domini_.[925] What was the\r\noutcome of this the chronicler fails to inform us, but the Council of\r\nCastile took a different view of the question when, in 1639, one of its\r\nmembers, Don Antonio Valdés, who had been sent to Extremadura as\r\ncommissioner to raise troops, was publicly excommunicated by the\r\ntribunal of Llerena because, in assessing contributions for that\r\npurpose, he had not exempted its officials and familiars. The Council\r\nthereupon appealed to Philip, who ordered the decree expunged from the\r\nrecords and that a copy of the royal order should be posted in the\r\nsecretariate of the tribunal.[926]\r\n\r\nYet it was about this time that the claim in behalf of unsalaried\r\nofficials seems to have been abandoned, for, in 1636, 1643 and 1644 the\r\nSuprema issued repeated injunctions that in the existing distress the\r\nroyal imposts and taxes must be paid. In 1646 it ordered the tribunal of\r\nValencia not to defend two familiars in resisting payment and in the\r\nsame year the Córtes of Aragon gained a victory which subjected them to\r\nall local charges.[927]\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the Bourbons the salaried officials found a change in\r\nthis as in so much else. In the financial exigencies of the War of\r\nSuccession they were subjected to repeated levies. Philip V called upon\r\nthem for five per cent. of their salaries and then for ten per cent. to\r\nwhich they were forced to submit. In 1712 a general tax was laid of a\r\ndoubloon per hearth, which was assessed in each community according to\r\nthe wealth of the individual. There were no exemptions and appeals were\r\nheard only by the provincial superintendents of the revenue. The sole\r\nconcession obtained by the Suprema was that, where officials of the\r\nInquisition were concerned, the local tribunal could name an assessor to\r\nsit with the superintendent and it warned the tribunals that any\r\ninterference with the collection would be repressed with the utmost\r\nseverity.[928] Salaries, however, were held to be subject only to\r\ndemands from the crown for, when Saragossa in 1727 endeavored to include\r\nthem in an assessment for local taxation, Philip, in response to an\r\nappeal from the Suprema, decided that those of the Inquisition, in\r\ncommon with other tribunals, should be exempt, but that real and\r\npersonal property, including trade, belonging to officials, should be\r\nheld liable to the tax.[929]\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the eighteenth century various documents show that\r\nall ideas of resistance and all pleas of exemption had been abandoned.\r\nThe Holy Office submitted to ordinary and extraordinary exactions and\r\nthe Suprema warned the tribunals that the assessments were wholly in the\r\nhands of the royal officers and that it had no cognizance of the matter.\r\nThe calls were frequent and heavy, as when, in 1794, four per cent. was\r\nlevied on all salaries of over eight hundred ducats, and three months\r\nlater a demand was made of one-third of the fruits of all benefices and\r\nprebends, which was meekly submitted to and statements were obediently\r\nrendered.[930] Under the Restoration, the Inquisition was less\r\ntractable. In 1818 an incometax was levied and was imposed on all\r\nsalaries, including those of the Suprema, which at once prepared for\r\nresistance. There seems to have been a prolonged struggle with a\r\nsuccessful result for, on November 17th, it issued a circular enclosing\r\na royal order which conceded exemption.[931]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe exemption from taxation, which included import and export dues or\r\nmerchandise and provisions required for officials and prisoners, led to\r\nthe claim of other privileges and to not a few abuses. It was not\r\nconfined to sea-ports and frontier towns, for the jealous particularism\r\nof the kingdoms, dynastically united, kept up their antagonistic policy\r\ntowards each other and intercourse between them was subjected to\r\nregulations similar to those of foreign trade. The exemption from these,\r\nas well as from the octroi duties of the towns, was a most important\r\nprivilege, capable of being turned to account in many ways besides\r\ndiminishing the expenses of the officials.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CUSTOMS DUTIES_]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Ferdinand, in 1508, prohibited the issue of orders to\r\npass goods free, but nevertheless it continued. When, in 1540, Blas\r\nOrtiz went to take possession of his office as inquisitor of Valencia,\r\nthe Suprema furnished him with a pass addressed to all customs officials\r\npermitting him to cross the frontiers with three horses and four\r\npack-mules; he could be required to swear that what he carried was his\r\nprivate property and was not for sale, but all further interference was\r\nhidden under pain of excommunication and a hundred ducats.[932] It was\r\nnot only on such occasions, however, that the customhouses were thus\r\neluded. Before the introduction of regular posts, the constant\r\ncommunications between the tribunals and with the Suprema were carried\r\nby couriers or by muleteers, and the mysterious secrecy which shrouded\r\nall the operations of the Holy Office furnished an excuse for preventing\r\nany risk that these sacred packages should be examined. All bearers of\r\nletters therefore, even when they had loaded mules, were furnished with\r\npasses forbidding, under excommunication and fine, any unpacking or\r\ninvestigation of what they carried.[933] The facilities thus offered for\r\ncontraband trade are obvious and their value can only be appreciated\r\nthrough a knowledge of the elaborate system of import and export duties\r\nand prohibitions of import and export which characterize the policy of\r\nthe period.[934] Complaints were fruitless, for when the Council of\r\nHacienda issued letters against certain familiars in the Canaries,\r\ndetected in importing prohibited goods, Philip II, February 11, 1593,\r\nordered the letters to be recalled and that no more should be\r\nissued.[935]\r\n\r\nThere were few things concerning which there was more jealousy than the\r\ntransfer of grain from one Spanish kingdom to another, and when it was\r\npermitted there were duties, either import or export or perhaps both.\r\nDeficient harvests, in one province or another, were not infrequent and\r\nthe tribunals were constantly seeking special relief by obtaining\r\npermits to violate the laws, or by violating the laws without permits.\r\nMany instances of this could be cited, but it will suffice to recount\r\nthe experience of the Valencia tribunal in endeavoring to obtain wheat\r\nfrom Aragon. For this it had special facilities, for the Aragonese\r\ndistricts of Teruel and Albarracin were subject to it, but, on the other\r\nhand, Aragon was especially firm in prohibiting the exportation of\r\nwheat. In 1522 the tribunal undertook to bring some wheat from Aragon\r\nand threatened the frontier officials with excommunication if they\r\nshould interfere. In spite of this they detained it, when the inquisitor\r\npublished the censures and imprisoned a guard whom he caught, whereupon\r\nthe Aragonese Diputados remonstrated, saying that if the emperor or pope\r\nwanted wheat from Aragon he applied for licence, and begging the\r\ninquisitor to keep within his jurisdiction and release the guard. Then\r\nan accommodation was reached and the tribunal was permitted to bring in\r\nthirty cahizes (about one hundred bushels), on condition of removing any\r\nexcommunication that might exist, but it repudiated its side of the\r\nagreement and summoned the officials to appear and receive penance. This\r\nexhausted the patience of the Diputados; they ordered the wheat to be\r\nstopped or, if it had gone forward to be followed and captured with the\r\nmules bearing it; the inquisitor might do what he pleased, but they\r\nwould employ all the forces of the kingdom and enforce respect for the\r\nlaws. The position in which the inquisitor had placed himself was so\r\nuntenable that the inquisitor-general issued an order forbidding\r\ntribunals to take anything out of Aragon in violation of the\r\nprohibitions.[936]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _IMPORTATION OF WHEAT_]\r\n\r\nThe effect of this rebuff was evanescent. The tribunal persisted and by\r\nfalse pretences established a claim which, in 1591, the Suprema warned\r\nit to use with moderation as the Council of Aragon was making complaint.\r\nAs usual no attention was paid to this and, in 1597, Philip II was\r\ncompelled to interfere because the tribunal was issuing to excess\r\nletters authorizing the export of wheat from Teruel--an abuse which was\r\ndoubtless abundantly profitable.[937] If this brought any amendment it\r\nwas transient. On June 16, 1606, the Diputados represented to the\r\ntribunal that they were bound by their oaths of office, under pain of\r\nexcommunication, to enforce the laws prohibiting the export of wheat;\r\nthat, in spite of these laws, large quantities were carried to Valencia,\r\nto the destruction and total ruin of the land, by individuals armed with\r\nlicences issued by the tribunal, wherefore they prayed that no more\r\nlicences be issued. No attention was paid to this and on January 8,\r\n1607, they wrote again, stating that the abuse was increasing and that\r\nthey must appeal to the king and the Suprema for its suppression. This\r\nbrought an answer to the effect that the tribunal was more moderate than\r\nit had previously been and would continue to be so as it would find\r\nconvenient, without prejudice to the rights conceded to it by the royal\r\ncédulas and, as it was occupied in the service of God, it could\r\nreasonably exercise those rights. The asserted rights under which it had\r\nso long nullified the laws of Aragon were a conscious fraud for, when it\r\ncomplained to the Suprema of the interference of the Diputados with its\r\nimmemorial privilege and enclosed the royal cédula conferring it, the\r\nSuprema pointed out that this referred only to Castile and not to\r\nAragon; the complaints of the Diputados had been listened to and all\r\nthat could be done was to invoke the good offices of the Saragossa\r\ntribunal to obtain permission to get fifteen hundred bushels per annum.\r\nThe Saragossa inquisitors willingly lent their aid, but in vain. They\r\nwrote, June 6, 1608, that they had brought to bear all their influence\r\non the Diputados who declared that the _fuero_ prohibiting the export of\r\ngrain was too strict for them to violate it. A correspondence ensued\r\nwith the Suprema which ordered the tribunal, February 8, 1610, to\r\nabstain, as previously ordered, but if, in any year, there should be\r\nspecial necessity, it might report the quantity required when\r\ninstructions would be given. This imposed silence on it until 1618, when\r\nanother attempt was made to overcome the obstinacy of the Diputados; it\r\nhad abstained, the tribunal said, for some years from issuing licences,\r\nin consequence of the great abuses and excesses of those to whom they\r\nwere granted, but now the sterility of the land causes great\r\ninconveniences and it asks that the fruits of its prebends in Aragon and\r\nits rents be invested in wheat allowed to be exported. The Diputados\r\nhowever wisely refused to open the door; the law to which they had sworn\r\nimposed heavy penalties for its infraction and they were compelled to\r\nrefuse. This was probably effectual, as far as concerned Aragon, for we\r\nhappen to find the tribunal, in 1631, obtaining from the king licence to\r\nimport two hundred and fifty bushels from Castile.[938]\r\n\r\nIMPORTATION OF WHEAT\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EVASION OF OCTROI DUTIES_]\r\n\r\nThis narrative is instructive in more ways than one. The pretence of\r\nnecessity in the service of God was as fraudulent as the claims put\r\nforward. The whole business was purely speculative and the licences were\r\ndoubtless sold to the highest bidder through all these years. The\r\nValencian tribunal was at no time in need of wheat from Aragon or\r\nCastile, for it had ample privileges at home for all its wants and it\r\nwas working these local privileges for a profit to some one. Among other\r\npublic-spirited acts of Ximenes was the founding, in 1512, of an\r\n_alhondiga_, or public granary, in Toledo so that, as we are told in\r\n1569, in times of scarcity the citizens could procure supplies at\r\nmoderate prices.[939] It was probably owing to this that other cities,\r\nincluding Valencia, formed establishments of the kind, monopolizing the\r\ntraffic in wheat, to which the citizens resorted day by day for their\r\nprovision. When a loss occurred in the business, from a surplus over the\r\ndemand or from spoiling of the grain, it was assessed upon the citizens,\r\nunder the name of _pan asegurado_, but, in 1530, the magistrates\r\nrelieved the officials of the tribunal from sharing this burden and the\r\nexemption is enumerated, in 1707, as still among its privileges.[940]\r\nAnother privilege, which it shared with the viceroy and the archbishop,\r\nwas that the baker who served it was the second one allowed every\r\nmorning to enter the granary and select a sack of wheat (_trigo fuerte_)\r\nof five and a half bushels and every week a _cahiz_ (3-1/2 bushels) of\r\n_trigo candeal_, without payment save a small tax known as _murs y\r\nvalls_--evidently for the maintenance of the city defences. This he\r\nbaked and distributed the bread among the officials and to the prison,\r\nin allotted portions, and what was over he sold--showing that the\r\ntribunal not only got its wheat gratuitously but more than it needed, to\r\nsomebody's profit. The amount must have been considerable, for the\r\nbakers complained of the unfair competition of the favored baker and, in\r\n1609, the city endeavored to put an end to the abuse, but without\r\nsuccess. The matter slumbered until 1627, when the city obtained a royal\r\ncédula abolishing the privilege of taking the wheat, but obedience to\r\nthis was refused because it had been issued without preliminary notice\r\nto the other side and without a junta or conference between the Suprema\r\nand the Council of Aragon. Then the city ordered the baker no longer to\r\ngo to the granary for wheat and the aggrieved Suprema complained loudly\r\nto the king, urging him to consider the services to God and the tonsure\r\nof the inquisitors and not to allow these holy labors to be interrupted\r\nby the necessity of going personally to the granary. To this Philip\r\nreplied by ordering the fueros to be observed, which was virtually a\r\nconfirmation of his cédula, but this seems to have been similarly\r\ndisregarded, for, in 1628 we find the city again endeavoring to put an\r\nend to the collateral abuse of the sale of the surplus bread and the\r\ntribunal busily engaged in gathering testimony to prove that this had\r\npublicly been the custom from time immemorial. In proving this, however,\r\nit also proved unconsciously how fraudulent had been the claim that it\r\nhad been in need of wheat from Aragon.[941]\r\n\r\nThis commercial development of the Inquisition led it to utilize its\r\nexemption from taxation and octroi duties by opening shops for the\r\nnecessaries of life, causing violent quarrels with the cities whose\r\nrevenues were impaired and whose laws were ostentatiously disregarded.\r\nAmong a number of cases of this in the records, a series of occurrences\r\nin Saragossa will illustrate this phase of the activity of the Holy\r\nOffice. A large part of the local revenues of the city was derived from\r\na monopoly of wine, meal and provisions and no citizen was allowed to\r\nbring these articles within the gates. The Aljafería, occupied by the\r\ntribunal, was situated a few hundred feet beyond the walls; the\r\ninquisitors assumed that they were not bound by the municipal\r\nregulations; they introduced what they pleased into the town and the\r\nauthorities complained that they maintained in the Aljafería a public\r\nmeat-market, a tavern and a shop where citizens could purchase freely to\r\nthe infinite damage of the public revenues. The Córtes of 1626 demanded\r\nthat affairs should be reduced to what they had been prior to the\r\ntroubles of 1591, when the Aljafería was garrisoned with soldiers,\r\ngiving rise to profitable trade, but the Suprema prevented the royal\r\nconfirmation of the acts of the Córtes and the matter was left open.\r\nThis led to troubles which came to a head, September 21, 1626, when a\r\nload of wine for the tribunal on entering the city was seized under the\r\nlaw by the guard and taken to the house of one of the jurados or\r\ntown-councillors. At once the inquisitors issued letters demanding its\r\nrelease under pain of excommunication and a thousand ducats. The jurados\r\nlost no time in forming the _competencia_, which, in accordance with the\r\nexisting Concordia, was the method provided for deciding such contests,\r\nbut the inquisitors refused to join in it, asserting that there could be\r\nno competencia, as it was a matter of faith and impeding the Inquisition\r\nin the exercise of its functions. They arrested and imprisoned one of\r\nthe guards, notwithstanding that he had letters of _manifestacion_ from\r\nthe court of the Justicia of Aragon--a species of habeas corpus of the\r\nhighest privilege in Aragon, which was traditionally venerated as the\r\npalladium of popular liberty--and the next day they seized three more\r\nwho were likewise _manifestados_. The incensed magistrates applied to\r\nthe Justicia and to the Diputados, to release by force the prisoners\r\nfrom the Aljafería and there was prospect of serious disorder. The\r\nGovernor of Aragon, however succeeded in getting himself accepted as\r\numpire by both sides and temporarily quieted them by the compromise that\r\nthe wagon, mules and wine should be delivered to him, that the prisoners\r\nshould be surrendered through him to the city and that the comminatory\r\nletters should be withdrawn, all this being without prejudice to either\r\nparty. He wrote earnestly to the king, pointing out the imminent danger\r\nof an outbreak and the necessity of a decision that should avert such\r\nperils for the future; if the assumption that such questions were\r\nmatters of faith were admitted, the inquisitors could refuse all\r\ncompetencias, which would annul the Concordia and destroy the royal\r\njurisdiction. The city also addressed him, saying that the inquisitors\r\nhad refused to abstain from further action pending his decision and if\r\nthese pretensions were admitted they would be unable to pay him the\r\nservicio which had been granted.[942]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SALT AND BAKE-OVEN_]\r\n\r\nThis resulted in a compromise, agreed upon between the Suprema and the\r\nCouncil of Aragon, under which the city obligated itself to supply the\r\ntribunal with meat, wine and ice. It was impossible however to compel\r\nthe Inquisition to observe compacts. Fresh complaints arose, the nature\r\nof which is indicated by a decree of Philip IV, June 17, 1630, requiring\r\nthe Suprema to order the inquisitors to keep to the agreement and not to\r\nsell any portion of the provisions furnished and further to stop the\r\ntrade carried on in some little houses in the Aljafería where the\r\nmunicipal supervisors could not inspect them. This resulted in a fresh\r\nagreement of December 7, 1631, under which the city bought for three\r\nthousand crowns the _casa de penitencia_, or prison for penitents, and\r\nengaged to maintain in it shops to the sale of meat and ice to the\r\ninhabitants of the Aljafería at the prices current in the town.[943]\r\n\r\nProbably this quieted the matter, but before long the irrepressible\r\ninquisitors started another disturbance. The salt-works of Remolinos and\r\nel Castellon belonged to the royal patrimony and were farmed out under\r\ncondition that no other salt should be sold or used in Saragossa and\r\nsome other places under heavy fines. To enforce this there were\r\ncommissioners empowered to investigate all suspected places, even\r\nchurches not being exempt. In 1640 a party in the city was found to be\r\nselling salt and confessed that he obtained it from the gardener of the\r\nAljafería. The commissioner, Baltasar Peralta, went there with a\r\nscrivener and in the gardener's cottage they found two sacks, one empty,\r\nthe other nearly full of salt, with a half-peck measure. They announced\r\nthe penalty to the gardener's wife and proceeded to enforce it in the\r\ncustomary manner by seizing pledges--in the present case, three horses.\r\nThe inquisitor, who had doubtless been sent for, came as they were\r\nleading the horses away, forced the surrender of the horses and salt and\r\ntold them that they should deem themselves lucky if they were not thrown\r\nin prison. Thereupon the royal advocate-fiscal of Aragon, Adrian de\r\nSada, reported the case to the king, adding that it was learned that the\r\ncoachman of one of the inquisitors was selling salt from the salt-works\r\nof Sobradiel. He pointed out that, if the servants of the Inquisition\r\ncould sell salt freely and the royal officials be deterred by threats\r\nfrom investigation, the revenue would be seriously impaired, for no one\r\nwould venture to farm the salt-works, and he asked for instructions\r\nbefore resorting to proceedings which might disturb the public peace, as\r\nhad happened on previous occasions. The matter was referred to the\r\nCouncil of Aragon, which advised the king to issue imperative commands\r\nthat the inquisitors should not obstruct the detection and punishment of\r\nfrauds, for their cognizance in no way pertained to the Holy\r\nOffice.[944]\r\n\r\nThe Saragossa tribunal had a still more prolonged and bitter dispute\r\nwith the city over the bake-oven of the Aljafería. This belonged to the\r\ncrown and, at some time prior to 1630, Philip IV made it over to the\r\ntribunal which was pleading poverty. Its use of the privilege soon\r\nbrought it into conflict with the city, but a complicated arrangement\r\nrespecting it was included in the agreement of December 7, 1631,\r\nrequiring the baker to purchase at least seventy bushels of wheat per\r\nmonth from the public granary, with certain restrictions as to the\r\nplaces whence he could procure further supplies. In 1649 we chance to\r\nlearn that the oven was farmed out for six thousand reales per annum and\r\nin 1663, a lively conflict arose because the tribunal had granted a\r\nlease which was not subject to the restrictions of 1631. Then again, in\r\n1690, the trouble broke out afresh, each side accusing the other of\r\nviolating the agreement. All the authorities, from the king and viceroy\r\ndown, were invoked to settle it; there were fears of violence but, May\r\n1, 1691, the tribunal reported to the Suprema that a compromise had been\r\nreached on satisfactory terms.[945]\r\n\r\nThe independent spirit of Aragon caused it to suffer less from the\r\nmercantile enterprises of the Inquisition than the more submissive\r\ntemper of Castile. In 1623 there was a flagrant case in Toledo, arising\r\nfrom a butcher-shop established by the tribunal in violation of the\r\nmunicipal laws. Its violent methods triumphed and Don Luis de Paredes,\r\nan alcalde de corte, sent thither to settle the matter, was disgraced\r\nfor attempting to restrain it. This called forth an energetic protest\r\nfrom the Council of Castile, which boldly told the king that he should\r\nnot shut his eyes to the fact that the inquisitors were extending their\r\nprivileges to matters beyond their competence, with such prejudice to\r\nthe public weal that they were making themselves superior to the laws,\r\nto the government and to the royal power, trampling on the judges,\r\nseizing the original documents, forcing them to revoke their righteous\r\nacts, arresting their officials and treating them as heretics because\r\nthey discharged their duty.[946]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SEIZURE OF PROVISIONS_]\r\n\r\nIn procuring provisions, whether for consumption or sale, besides the\r\nfreedom from local imposts, the Inquisition had the further advantage of\r\nemploying coercive methods on unwilling vendors and of disregarding\r\nlocal regulations and prohibitions. As early as 1533 the Aragonese, at\r\nthe Córtes of Monzon, took the alarm and petitioned that the statutes of\r\nthe towns, when short of bread-stuffs and provisions, should be binding\r\non officials of the Inquisition, to which the emperor's reply was the\r\nequivocating one customary when evading confirmation.[947] The\r\nsignificance of this is manifested by a _carta acordada_ of 1540,\r\nauthorizing the tribunals to get wheat in the villages for their\r\nofficials and prisoners and, if the local magistrates interfere, to\r\ncoerce them with excommunication. Yet inquisitorial zeal in using this\r\npermission sometimes overstepped the bounds and, in this same year, the\r\nSuprema had occasion to rebuke a tribunal which had issued orders to\r\nfurnish it with wheat under pain of a hundred lashes, for it was told\r\nthat, in rendering such extra-judicial sentences, it was exceeding its\r\njurisdiction.[948] How bravely the Suprema itself overcame all such\r\nscruples was manifest when laws of maximum prices, and the heavy\r\ndiscount on the legal-tender spurious vellon coinage, rendered holders\r\nof goods unwilling to part with them at the legal rates. It issued,\r\nFebruary 14, 1626, to its alcalde, Pedro de Salazar, an order to go to\r\nany places in the vicinage and embargo sheep and whatever else he deemed\r\nnecessary, sufficient for the maintenance of the households of the\r\ninquisitor-general and of the members and officials, paying therefore at\r\nthe rates fixed by law, to effect which he was empowered to call for aid\r\non all royal justices, who were required to furnish all necessary aid\r\nunder penalty of major excommunication _latæ sententiæ_ and five hundred\r\nducats. So again, on April 11, 1630, Salazar was ordered to go anywhere\r\nin the kingdom and seize six bushels of wheat, in baked bread, for the\r\nsame households, paying for it at the established price, and all\r\nofficials, secular, ecclesiastical and inquisitorial, were required to\r\nassist him under the same penalties.[949] This was an organized raid on\r\nall the bakeries of Madrid, and Salazar was more scrupulous than the\r\naverage official of the time if he did not turn an honest penny by\r\ntaking bread on his own account at the legal rate and selling it at the\r\ncurrent one.[950]\r\n\r\nThe tribunal of Valencia enjoyed another privilege in the important\r\nmatter of salt, the royal monopoly of which rendered it so costly to the\r\nordinary consumer. Every year the tribunal issued an order to the\r\nfarmers of the salt-works, commanding them, under pain of\r\nexcommunication and fifty ducats, to deliver to the receiver of\r\nconfiscations twelve cahizes (about forty-two bushels) of refined salt,\r\nat the price of eight reales the cahiz, and the custom-house officials\r\nwere summoned, under the same penalties, to let it pass without\r\ndetention or trouble for the service of God. The salt was duly\r\napportioned among the officials at this trivial price, each inquisitor\r\ngetting four bushels down to the messengers who received two-thirds of a\r\nbushel, and even _jubilado_ officials had their portion. When or how\r\nthis originated is unknown; in 1644 it seems established as of old date\r\nand it continued until 1710, when the new dynasty brought it to a sudden\r\nconclusion. The Council of Hacienda reported it to the king, as though\r\nit were a novelty just discovered, pointing out that the eight reales\r\nwere less than the cost of transport from the works to the magazines;\r\nthat the manufacture was a monopoly of the regalías and the price\r\ncharged was in no respect a tax or impost, but was regulated by the\r\nnecessities of the national defence; that no other tribunal in Spain,\r\nsecular or ecclesiastic, made such a demand, while the publication of\r\ncensures against royal officials was dangerous in those calamitous\r\ntimes. This aroused Philip, who ordered a prompt remedy. The Suprema no\r\nlonger ventured an opposition or remonstrance, but wrote immediately to\r\nValencia expressing its surprise; the demand must be withdrawn at once;\r\nif any censures had been published they must be revoked and no such\r\ndemonstration should have been made without previous consultation.[951]\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to adduce further examples of the manner in\r\nwhich the tribunals abused their power for unlawful gains and benefits,\r\nand we can readily conceive the exasperation thus excited, even among\r\nthose most zealous in the extermination of heresy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BILLETING TROOPS_]\r\n\r\nFew of the privileges claimed by the Inquisition gave rise to more\r\nbickering and contention than its demand that all connected with it\r\nshould be exempt from the billeting of troops and the furnishing of\r\n_bagages_ or beasts of burden for transportation. The subject is one of\r\nminor importance, but it furnishes so typical an illustration of\r\ninquisitorial methods that it is worthy of examination somewhat in\r\ndetail. Under the old monarchy the _yantar_ or _droit de gîte_, or right\r\nto free quarters, was an insufferable burden. Almost every Córtes of\r\nLeon and Castile, from the twelfth century complained of it\r\nenergetically, for it was exercised, not only by the royal court in its\r\nincessant peregrinations, but by nobles and others who could enforce it,\r\nand it was accompanied by spoliation of every kind, while the\r\nimpressment of beasts of burden was an associated abuse and even the\r\nlands of the Church were not exempt.[952] The more independent Aragonese\r\nwere unwilling to submit to it, and a fuero of the Córtes of Aleañiz, in\r\n1436, provided that the courtiers and followers of the king should pay\r\nall Christians in whose houses they lodged.[953] When the Inquisition\r\nwas founded and was to a great extent peripatetic, its officials\r\napparently claimed free quarters, for a clause in the Instructions of\r\n1498 provides that where a tribunal was set up they should pay for their\r\naccommodations and provide their own beds and necessaries.[954] When\r\ntravelling, a decree of Ferdinand, October 21, 1500, repeated in 1507,\r\n1516, 1518, 1532, and 1561, provided that they should have gratuitous\r\nlodging and beds, with food at moderate prices.[955] The frequent\r\nrepetition of this indicates that it aroused opposition and, in 1601,\r\nwhen the inquisitor of Valencia was ordered to go at once on a\r\nvisitation of Tortosa, he was told not to oppress the city by demanding\r\nfree quarters but to lodge decently in a monastery or in the house of\r\nsome official.[956]\r\n\r\nFurnishing free quarters however was different from enjoying them. The\r\nold abuses gradually disappeared with the settled habitations for kings\r\nand tribunals, but the change in military organization, with standing\r\narmies, gave rise to others which, if more occasional, were also more\r\noppressive--the billeting of troops. When Louis XIV resorted to the\r\n_dragonnades_--the quartering of dragoons on Huguenot families--as an\r\neffective coercion to conversion, it shows how severe was the\r\ninfliction. The rebellion of Catalonia, in 1640, had for its proximate\r\ncause the outrages committed by troops quartered for the winter in\r\nplaces insufficient for their support, culminating in their burning the\r\nchurches of Riu de Arenas and Montiró.[957] The massacre in Saragossa,\r\nDecember 28, 1705, of the French troops in the service of Philip V, had\r\nthe same origin.[958]\r\n\r\nAs the pay of Spanish armies was habitually in arrears and the\r\ncommissariat system imperfect, it can be realized how valuable was the\r\nprivilege of exemption from entertaining these uninvited guests and\r\nproviding them with transportation when they departed. In the war with\r\nPortugal, in 1666, Galicia suffered so seriously that we are told a\r\ncompany of cavalry was worth to its captain two thousand ducats in\r\nransoms, from outrage.[959] That the Inquisition should claim such\r\nexemption was to be expected, for it was one of the privileges of\r\nhidalgos, but the earliest allusion to it that I have met occurs in\r\n1548, when Inquisitor-general Valdés ordered that no billets must be\r\ngiven on houses occupied by inquisitors or officials, even though not\r\ntheir own or during their absence, for their clothes were in them.[960]\r\nWhat authority he had to issue such a command it might be difficult to\r\nsay, but it indicates that the exemption was an innovation and, as it\r\nrefers only to salaried officials, it infers that the numerous\r\nunsalaried ones were not entitled to the privilege, which is further\r\nproved by the fact that, in the Castilian Concordia of 1553, regulating\r\nthe exemptions of familiars, there is no allusion to billeting. The\r\naction of Valdés, however, settled the matter as far as the salaried\r\nofficials were concerned and even the Aragonese Córtes of 1646, which\r\ngreatly limited the claims of the Inquisition, admitted that they had\r\nthe same privileges as hidalgos.[961]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BILLETING TROOPS_]\r\n\r\nThe determination with which this was enforced is seen in a case in\r\n1695, when Inquisitor Sanz y Múñoz of Barcelona threatened with\r\nexcommunication and a fine of two hundred libras the town-councillors of\r\nManlleu if they should assign quarters in a country-house belonging to\r\nthe portero of the Inquisition, although it was occupied by a peasant\r\nwho worked on the land. The councillors appealed for protection to the\r\nAudiencia, or royal court, which invited the inquisitor to settle the\r\nmatter amicably in the prescribed form of a competencia, but he treated\r\nthe overture with such contempt that he promptly issued a second\r\nmandate, under the same penalties, and summoned the councillors to\r\nappear before him as having incurred them. The Audiencia made another\r\nattempt at pacification to which he replied that he proposed at once to\r\ndeclare the councillors as publicly excommunicated. The Diputados of\r\nCatalonia thereupon protested vigorously to the king that, while all the\r\nrest of the people were patriotically united in aiding the war, and the\r\ngentry had voluntarily foregone their privilege of exemption, the\r\nofficials and familiars of the Inquisition were exciting tumults and\r\nriots in their efforts to extend exemptions to those who had no\r\nclaim.[962]\r\n\r\nThe chief trouble arose with the unsalaried officials, especially the\r\nmultitudinous familiars, who had no claim to exemption. The Barcelona\r\ntribunal seems to have started it, for one of the complaints made to de\r\nSoto Salazar, on his visitation of 1567, was that the inquisitors\r\nforbade the quartering of soldiers in the houses of familiars; in his\r\nreport he suggested that it should be done when necessary and the\r\nAragonese Concordia of 1568 followed this idea by prohibiting\r\ninquisitors to support familiars in refusing to receive men assigned to\r\nthem when there were no other houses to receive them.[963] There was\r\nevidently no recognized exemption but a steady effort to establish one,\r\nwhile the familiars complained that the hatred felt for them led to\r\ntheir being oppressed with billets when others went free. To remedy this\r\nPhilip II, in a cédula of February 21, 1576, ordered that no\r\ndiscrimination should be made against them, but that they should be\r\nplaced on an equality with justicias and regidores who were not called\r\nupon to furnish quarters until all other houses were occupied.\r\nComplaints continued and he advanced a step, February 22, 1579, by\r\ndecreeing that for three years, in towns of upwards of five hundred\r\nhearths, familiars should be exempt from billeting and furnishing\r\ntransportation; in smaller towns, one-half should be exempted and where\r\nthere was but one he should be exempt. This was renewed frequently for\r\nthree years at a time and as frequently was overlooked, but this made\r\nlittle difference for we are told by an experienced inquisitor that it\r\nwas always assumed to be in force and, when a familiar complained of a\r\nbillet, the tribunal would issue a mandate ordering his relief within\r\nthree hours under a penalty of 100,000 mrs.; if the exemption was in\r\nforce, a copy of the cédula was included in the mandate, if it was not\r\nit still was quoted as existing in the archives of the tribunal.[964]\r\n\r\nThere were few questions which gave rise to more embroilment than this.\r\nBoth sides were unscrupulous; the privilege excited ill-will, it was\r\nevaded by the authorities wherever possible and the tribunals were kept\r\nbusy in defending their familiars with customary violence. At length, in\r\n1634, the necessities of the state were pleaded by Philip IV as his\r\nreason for withdrawing all exemptions--a measure which he was obliged to\r\nrepeat more than once.[965] It is somewhat remarkable therefore that,\r\nwhen the Córtes of Aragon, in 1646, succeeded in greatly abridging the\r\nprivileges of familiars, they were included with the salaried officials\r\nin the exemption from billets. This did not avail them much for we are\r\ntold that, in the changes effected by the Córtes, the terror felt for\r\nthe Inquisition was so greatly diminished that there was scant ceremony\r\nin imposing on its officials; that the familiars were singled out to\r\nhave two or three soldiers quartered on them and when they complained\r\nthe tribunal ventured no more than to instruct its commissioner to use\r\npersuasion.[966] Catalonia was not so fortunate and strife continued\r\nwith the usual bitterness. As a frontier province, in war time it was\r\noccupied with troops and there were abundant opportunities for friction.\r\nIn 1695 the Diputados complained that, as the only mode of escaping\r\nbillets was to become a familiar, many had themselves appointed,\r\nalthough there was already an innumerable multitude, and that even when\r\nthe local magistrates were compelled to receive soldiers, the familiars\r\nrefused, in contempt of the royal orders.[967]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BILLETING TROOPS_]\r\n\r\nThe War of Succession brought fresh necessities and the change of\r\ndynasty was unfavorable to the Inquisition in this as in so much else. A\r\nroyal decree of February 11, 1706, abolished all exemptions but, as a\r\nfavor to the Inquisition, four of its officials were excepted in towns\r\nand twenty in cities that were seats of tribunals. The Suprema accepted\r\nthis cheerfully but, when a decree of January 19, 1712, revoked all\r\nexemptions, it remonstrated and was told that, while the king recognized\r\nthe claims of the Inquisition to all the privileges granted by his\r\npredecessors, the existing urgency required the withdrawal of all\r\nexemptions and, as the law was absolute, he could make no exceptions.\r\nAlthough this covered the salaried officials, it seems to have been the\r\nfamiliars who complained the loudest; possibly now that the tribunals\r\ncould no longer protect them they were exposed to special\r\ndiscrimination. It was a question of money, however, rather than of\r\nhardship, for a system of composition had been developed under which by\r\npaying the _cuartel_ or _utensilio_--an assessment proportioned to the\r\nwealth of the individual--the billet was escaped.[968] When the urgency\r\nof immediate peril was passed these decrees were either withdrawn or\r\nbecame obsolete. The claim of exemption revived and with it the active\r\nefforts of the tribunals to protect those whose exemptions were\r\ndisregarded and to punish the officials who disregarded them.[969]\r\n\r\nIn 1728 Philip V made a well-intentioned attempt to relieve the\r\noppression of the poor arising from the numerous classes of officials\r\nwho claimed exemption from the common burdens, including the billeting\r\nof troops. As for the familiars, he says, who all claim exemptions and\r\ngive rise to disturbances, attacks on the local magistrates, with\r\nexcommunications and other penalties, and perpetual competencias, all\r\nthis must cease. Yet he admits their exemption and only insists that it\r\nmust be confined to the number allowed by the Concordia of 1553; that\r\nlimitation had never been observed and the inquisitors had appointed\r\nlarge numbers in excess of it, in spite of perpetual remonstrance, and\r\nPhilip now ordered that tribunals should not issue certificates to more\r\nthan the legal number and should not take proceedings against the local\r\nmagistrates.[970] As usual the royal orders were disregarded. The\r\ntribunal of Valencia threatened with excommunication and fine the\r\nmagistrates of Játiva and San Mateo, at the instance of some familiars\r\non whom soldiers had been quartered, and, on learning this, Philip\r\naddressed the Suprema in 1729 stating that the records showed that\r\nfamiliar were entitled to no exemption; even if they were, the tribunal\r\nhad exceeded its powers in employing obstreperous methods in defiance of\r\nthe royal decrees. There must be no competencia; the Valencia tribunal\r\nmust be notified not to exceed its jurisdiction and the Suprema itself\r\nmust observe the royal orders. After the delay of a month, the Suprema\r\nforwarded the royal letter to Valencia, sullenly telling the tribunal to\r\nreport what could be done and not to act further without orders.[971]\r\n\r\nFor two centuries the Inquisition had been accustomed to obey or to\r\ndisregard the royal decrees at its pleasure and to tyrannize over the\r\nlocal authorities. The habit was not easily broken and it was hard to\r\nconform itself to the new order of things. A formulary of about 1740\r\ncontains a letter to be sent to magistrates granting billets on\r\nfamiliars, couched in the old arrogant and peremptory terms and\r\nthreatening excommunication and a fine of two hundred ducats. Familiars,\r\nit says, are not to furnish quarters and beasts of burden, except in\r\nextreme urgency when no exemptions are permitted, and this it assumes to\r\nbe in accordance with the royal decrees, including the latest one of\r\nNovember 3, 1737.[972] I can find no trace of a decree of 1737 and we\r\nmay assume that it was this obstinacy of the Inquisition that induced\r\nPhilip, in 1743, to reissue his decree of 1728 with an expression of\r\nregret at its inobservance and the disastrous results which had ensued;\r\nhe added that, when the houses of the non-exempt were insufficient for\r\nquartering troops, they could be billeted on hidalgos and nobles.[973]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BEARING ARMS_]\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition still adhered to its claims, but Carlos III taught it to\r\nabandon its comminatory style. When, in 1781, the authorities of\r\nCastellon de la Plana billeted troops on familiars, the Valencia\r\ntribunal adopted the more judicious method of persuading the\r\ncaptain-general that they were to be classed with hidalgos and he issued\r\norders to that effect. This did not please Carlos III, who brushed aside\r\nthe claim to exemption by a peremptory order that the familiars of\r\nCastellon de la Plana should subject themselves to the local government\r\nin the matters of billets and that there should be no change until he\r\nshould issue further commands.[974]\r\n\r\nThis would seem in principle to abrogate all claims to exemption, but\r\nSpanish tenacity still held fast to what it had claimed and, in 1800,\r\nwhen José Poris, a familiar of Alcira, complained that the governor had\r\nquartered on him an officer of the regiment of Sagunto, the Valencia\r\ntribunal took measures for his relief.[975] The times were adverse to\r\nprivilege, however, and in 1805 the Captain-general of Catalonia sent a\r\ncircular to all the towns stating that familiars were not exempt. The\r\nmagistrates accordingly compelled them to furnish quarters and beasts of\r\nburden, and, when the tribunal complained to the captain-general and\r\nadduced proofs in support of its claims, he responded with the decrees\r\nof 1729 and 1743, which he assumed to have abrogated the exemption and\r\nhe continued to coerce the familiars. The same process was going on in\r\nValencia and, when that tribunal applied to Barcelona for information\r\nand learned the result, it ordered its familiars to submit under\r\nprotest. Then followed a royal cédula of August 20, 1807, limiting\r\nstrictly what exemptions were still allowed; the Napoleonic invasion\r\nsupervened and under the Restoration I have met with no trace of their\r\nsurvival.[976]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother privilege which occasioned endless debate and contention was the\r\nright of officials and familiars to bear arms, especially prohibited\r\nones. This was a subject which, during the middle ages, had taxed to the\r\nutmost the civilizing efforts of legislators, while the power assumed by\r\ninquisitors to issue licences to carry arms, in contravention of\r\nmunicipal statutes, was the source of no little trouble, especially in\r\nItalian cities.[977] The necessity of restriction, for the sake of\r\npublic peace, was peculiarly felt in Spain, where the popular temper and\r\nthe sensitiveness as to the _pundonor_ were especially provocative of\r\ndeadly strife.[978] It would be impossible to enumerate the endless\r\nseries of decrees which succeeded each other with confusing rapidity and\r\nthe repetition of which, in every variety of form, shows conclusively\r\nhow little they were regarded and how little they effected. Particular\r\nenergy was directed against _armas alevosas_--treacherous weapons--which\r\ncould be concealed about the person. In the Catalan Córtes of 1585,\r\nPhilip II denounced arquebuses, fire-locks and more especially the small\r\nones known as pistols, as unworthy the name of arms, as treacherous\r\nweapons useless in war and provocative of murder, which had caused great\r\ndamage in Catalonia and had been prohibited in his other kingdoms. They\r\nwere therefore forbidden, not only to be carried but even to be\r\npossessed at home and in secret, and against this no privilege should\r\navail, whether of the military class or official or familiar of the\r\nInquisition or by licence of the king or captain-general, under penalty\r\nfor those of gentle blood of two years' exile, for plebeians of two\r\nyears' galley-service, and for Frenchmen or Gascons of death, without\r\npower of commutation by any authority. Three palms, or twenty-seven\r\ninches of barrel, was the minimum length allowed for fire-arms in\r\nCatalonia and four palms in Castile. Philip IV, in 1663, even prohibited\r\nthe manufacture of pistols and deprived of exemptions and fuero those\r\nwho carried them, while as for poniards and daggers, Philip V, in 1721,\r\nthreatened those who bore them with six years of presidio for nobles and\r\nsix years of galleys for commoners.[979]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BEARING ARMS_]\r\n\r\nThese specimens of multitudinous legislation, directed against arms of\r\nall kinds, enable us to appreciate how highly prized was the privilege\r\nof carrying them. In an age of violence it was indispensable for defence\r\nand was equally desired as affording opportunities for offence. That the\r\nInquisition should claim it for those in its service was inevitable and\r\nit had the excuse, at least during the earlier period, that there was\r\ndanger in the arrest and transportation of prisoners and in the enmities\r\nwhich it provoked, although this latter danger was much less than it\r\nhabitually claimed. The old rules, moreover, were well known under which\r\nno local laws were allowed to interfere with such privilege,[980] and\r\nthe Inquisition had scarce been established in Valencia when the\r\nquestion arose through the refusal of the local authorities to allow\r\nits ministers to carry arms. Ferdinand promptly decided the matter in\r\nits favor by an order, March 22, 1486 that licences should be issued to\r\nall whom the inquisitors might name--for the time had not yet come in\r\nwhich the inquisitors themselves issued licences.[981] Probably\r\ncomplaints arose as to the abuse of the privilege for the instructions\r\nof 1498, which were principally measures of reform, provided that, in\r\ncities, where bearing arms was forbidden, no official should carry them\r\nexcept when accompanying an inquisitor or alguazil.[982] As indicated by\r\nthis, policy on the subject was unsettled and it so remained for a\r\nwhile. November 14, 1509, Ferdinand ordered that the ministers of the\r\nSicilian Inquisition should not be deprived of their arms; June 2, 1510,\r\nhe thanked the Valencia tribunal for providing that its officials should\r\ngo unarmed, for, by the grace of God, there is no one now who impedes or\r\nresists the Inquisition and, if there were, the royal officials or he in\r\nperson will provide for it; then, in about three months, on August 28th,\r\nhe wrote to the Governor of Valencia that the salaried officials of the\r\ntribunal, with their servants and forty familiars should enjoy all the\r\nprerogatives of the Holy Office and were not to be deprived of their\r\narms.[983]\r\n\r\nWe see in all this traces of general popular opposition to exempting\r\ninquisitorial officials from the laws forbidding arms-bearing. This was\r\nstimulated by the difficulty of preventing the exemptions from being\r\nclaimed by unauthorized persons without limit, leading Catalonia, in the\r\nConcordia of 1512, to provide that officials bearing arms could be\r\ndisarmed, like other citizens, unless they could show a certificate from\r\nthe tribunal, and further that the number of familiars for the whole\r\nprincipality should be reduced to thirty, except in cases of\r\nnecessity.[984] Although this Concordia was not observed,\r\nInquisitor-general Mercader, in his instructions of August 28, 1514,\r\nadmitted the necessity of such regulations by prohibiting the issue of\r\nlicences to bear arms; by reducing the overgrown number of familiars to\r\ntwenty-five in Barcelona and ten each in Perpignan and other towns, by\r\npermitting the disarmament of those who could not exhibit certificates\r\nand by endeavoring to check the fraud of lending these certificates by\r\nrequiring them to swear not to do so and keeping lists whereby they\r\ncould be identified.[985]\r\n\r\nThe right of arming its familiars, thus assumed by the Inquisition was\r\nby no means uncontested. We have seen how the Empress Isabella when in\r\nValencia, in 1524, ordered the arms taken from them and broken, leading\r\nto a protest from Inquisitor-general Manrique, who asserted this to be a\r\nprivilege enjoyed since the introduction of the Inquisition. In spite of\r\nthis Charles V, by a cédula of August 2, 1539, ordered inquisitors to\r\nprohibit the use of arms by familiars.[986] The matter remained a\r\nsubject of contest for some years more. In 1553 there were quarrels\r\nconcerning it between the Valencia tribunal and the local authorities,\r\nbut the Concordia of 1554 admitted the right unreservedly.[987]\r\n\r\nBy this time, in fact, it was generally recognized, but this, in place\r\nof removing a cause of discord only intensified and multiplied it. The\r\nright to bear arms could scarce be held to include weapons which were\r\nprohibited to all by general regulations, yet the authorities had no\r\njurisdiction over familiars to enforce them. Thus when flint-lock\r\narquebuses were prohibited and the Viceroy of Valencia included\r\nfamiliars in a proclamation on the subject, in 1562, Philip II called\r\nhim to account, telling him that the order must come from the\r\ninquisitors and, in 1575 he repeated this to the Viceroy of\r\nCatalonia.[988] The Suprema might decide that familiars were included in\r\nprohibitory decrees and that inquisitors must issue the necessary\r\norders, as it did, in 1596, with regard to one respecting daggers and in\r\n1598 to one forbidding fire-locks and pistols at night,[989] but the\r\ntribunals had no police to enforce these orders and, when the secular\r\nauthorities undertook to do so, inquisitors were prompt to resent it, in\r\ntheir customary fashion, as a violation of the immunities of the Holy\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BEARING ARMS_]\r\n\r\nEven more fruitful of trouble was the fact that it was impossible to\r\nmake the inquisitors respect the limitations imposed by the Concordias\r\non the number of familiars and consequently to obey the rule of\r\nfurnishing lists of them to the authorities so that they might be known.\r\nAppointments were lavished greatly in excess of all possible needs and\r\nwithout informing the magistrates--often, indeed, without keeping\r\nrecords in the archives. The familiar might or might not carry with him\r\nthe evidence of his official character but, whether he did so or not,\r\nhis arrest or disarmament was violently resented, and the ordinary\r\ncitizen when caught offending was apt to claim that he was a familiar in\r\nhopes of being released. How exasperating to the civil authorities was\r\nthe situation may be gathered from a case occurring in Barcelona, in\r\n1568. The veguer, on his nightly rounds, arrested Franco Foix, whom he\r\nfound armed with a coat of mail, sword, buckler and dagger. The culprit\r\nclaimed to be a familiar and the veguer obediently handed him over to\r\nthe tribunal. He proved not to be one, but, instead of returning him,\r\nthe inquisitors fined him in forty-four reales for their own benefit\r\n(presumably as a penalty for personating an official) and restored to\r\nhim his forfeited arms.[990] When the laws were thus openly set at\r\ndefiance, conditions were eminently favorable for quarrels, even without\r\nthe violent mutual animosity everywhere existing between the tribunals\r\nand the civil authorities; collisions were correspondingly frequent and\r\nwere fought to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nIt would be wearisome to multiply cases illustrating the various phases\r\nof these quarrels which occupied the attention of the king and his\r\ncouncils in their settlement. A single one will suffice to show the\r\nspirit in which they were conducted on both sides. In 1620, by order of\r\nthe tribunal of Valencia, acting in its secular capacity and not in a\r\nmatter of faith, the commissioner at Játiva arrested a man and sent him\r\nto Valencia under the customary guard of relays of familiars. One of\r\nthese named Juan López, armed with a prohibited flint-lock, was\r\nconveying him, on February 23d, when at Catarroja, about a league from\r\nthe city, some armed alguaziles, in the service of Dr. Pedro Juan\r\nRejaule, a judge on the criminal side of the Audiencia, arrested him,\r\ntaking away his weapon and carrying him to Dr. Rejaule's house.\r\nDisregarding his documents, Rejaule told him that he could not be\r\nreleased without giving bail to present himself to the viceroy and, as\r\nhe was unable to furnish it he was handed as a prisoner to the local\r\nmagistrates. On learning the event the inquisitors applied to the regent\r\nof the Audiencia who ordered the release of López, which was effected\r\nand Rejaule visited the tribunal, admitted that he had been in error and\r\npromised in future to observe all necessary respect. In spite of this\r\nthe inquisitors proceeded to try him for impeding the Inquisition,\r\nordered him to keep his house as a prison under pain of three hundred\r\nducats, and threw into the secret prison as though they were heretics,\r\nthe four alguaziles who had made the arrest. When notice of this was\r\nserved on Rejaule he protested that the inquisitors were not his judges\r\nand that he would appeal, whereupon the additional indignity was\r\ninflicted upon him of posting two guards in his house with orders to\r\nkeep him in sight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BEARING ARMS_]\r\n\r\nThis produced a crisis. The viceroy assembled in his palace all three\r\n_salas_ or branches of the Audiencia, where the matter was fully\r\ndiscussed and it was resolved to release Rejaule and hold the two guards\r\nas hostages for the imprisoned alguaziles. At 2 A.M. Dr. Morla went with\r\nhalberdiers furnished by the viceroy, seized and handcuffed the guards\r\nand brought Rejaule to his brother judges. At the same time a scrivener\r\nof the court had been sent to the inquisitor Salazar with a message from\r\nthe viceroy to the effect that, as the offence had not been in a matter\r\nof faith, Rejaule was justiciable only by the king; if the Inquisition\r\nheld otherwise a competencia could be formed; the Audiencia had decided\r\nthat Rejaule and the alguaziles must be released and the guards be held\r\nuntil this was done. The scrivener also presented a petition of appeal\r\nto the pope, or to whomsoever was judge, and demanded _apostolos_ or\r\nletters to that effect. To this Salazar replied in writing that the\r\narrests had been made for matters incident to and dependent upon affairs\r\nof the faith, in which the Inquisition had exclusive jurisdiction and\r\ncould admit no competencia; he could say no more as to the cause of the\r\narrests without violating the secrecy of the Inquisition and incurring\r\nexcommunication and he begged the viceroy not to interfere in a matter\r\nconcerning so greatly the service of God and the king. At 4 A.M. the\r\nscrivener returned with this reply to where the viceroy and judges were\r\nwaiting. At the magic word \"faith,\" however fraudulently employed, all\r\nopposition vanished. By six o'clock Dr. Morla had taken Rejaule back to\r\nhis house and had replaced the guards and, at the same time, the\r\nscrivener bore to the inquisitors a note from the viceroy saying that,\r\nas they had certified that it was a matter of faith, the Audiencia had\r\nrestored everything to its previous condition and he offered not only\r\nnot to impede the Inquisition but to show it all aid and favor.\r\n\r\nThe case was thus transferred to the court, where the Suprema on one\r\nside and the Council of Aragon on the other, struggled for a favorable\r\ndecision from Philip III. The former evidently felt the weakness of the\r\nclaim that the faith was involved, but it argued that impeding the\r\nInquisition in any way conferred jurisdiction on it and Aliaga, in his\r\ndouble capacity of inquisitor-general and royal confessor, added a\r\nbitter complaint as to the manner in which the Inquisition was abused\r\nand maltreated. To this the king replied that he wished the affair\r\ntreated with the customary moderation and mercy of the Holy Office,\r\nespecially as it was not directly a matter of faith, and whatever\r\nsentence the Suprema resolved upon for Rejaule and the other inculpated\r\nparties must be submitted to him before publication. Besides, he ordered\r\na junta of two members each of the Suprema and the Council of Aragon to\r\nbe formed and to devise a plan for the avoidance of future contention.\r\nThis assumed Rejaule's guilt and awarded the victory to the Suprema, but\r\nit was not satisfied and presented a consulta representing the perilous\r\ncondition of the Valencia tribunal, which necessitated the punishment of\r\nthe delinquents as a warning, but Philip merely repeated his former\r\ndecision.[991]\r\n\r\nWhat was Rejaule's fate we have no means of knowing, but his career was\r\nevidently blasted, whatever may have been the so-called mercy exhibited.\r\nAs for the perilous position of the tribunal insisted on by the Suprema,\r\nit seems to be set forth in a Petition of the syndic of the College of\r\nFamiliars, February 25, 1616, complaining of arrests and ill-treatment\r\nand asking the tribunal to take evidence on the subject. It accordingly\r\ndid so, but while the testimony was ample as to the existence of\r\nill-feeling towards the familiars, in substance it amounted only to\r\ntheir being deprived at night of daggers and bucklers which were\r\nprohibited weapons, and it does not appear that any action was taken in\r\nconsequence. Complaints continued and another petition of October 30,\r\n1626, asked that an envoy be sent to the Suprema, for which the\r\nfamiliars would defray the cost, for unless some relief was had they\r\nwould resign in a body, as their position only exposed them to wrong and\r\ninsult and their privileges were set at naught.[992]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of enforcing the laws on the people was intensified by\r\nthe privileges claimed by the familiars. They were by no means peaceable\r\nfolk and the unprivileged class naturally regarded it as a hardship to\r\nbe restricted to the use of swords when these gentry were so much more\r\nefficiently armed. The Suprema as a rule supported its satellites. For\r\nten years, from 1574, it resisted, in Aragon, the enforcement on\r\nfamiliars of a royal decree against carrying prohibited weapons at\r\nnight, although the Concordia of Aragon in 1568 provided that familiars\r\nshould obey the laws respecting arms and that inquisitors should not\r\nprotect them in violations. Members of all the Royal Councils were\r\ninvolved in the discussion, as though it were the weightiest affair of\r\nstate and it was not until 1584 that the Suprema was induced to issue\r\nthe necessary orders, which it was obliged to repeat in 1592.[993]\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of its attitude occurs with respect to a pragmática\r\nof great severity against the use of fire-arms, issued by Philip III,\r\nMarch 14, 1613, pronouncing the mere discharge of a weapon to be a\r\ncapital offence, whether death ensued or not. It abrogated all\r\nprivileges and exemptions and conferred on the royal courts full\r\njurisdiction in such cases, and all this was accepted and its observance\r\nenjoined by the Suprema. This met with such scant obedience that the\r\nCouncil of Aragon in a consulta of July 31, 1632, called the king's\r\nattention to the evils existing from the exemption of familiars and\r\nsuggested that they should not be permitted to decline the jurisdiction\r\nof the courts for crimes committed with fire-arms. It was doubtless in\r\nconsequence of opposition by the Suprema that it was not until September\r\n30, 1633, that Philip IV, in a cédula addressed to the Viceroy of\r\nValencia, ordered that, with the assent of the Councils of Aragon and of\r\nthe Inquisition, the pragmática of 1613 must be strictly observed by\r\nwhich all exemptions were disallowed and offenders were triable and\r\npunishable by the royal courts; the Inquisition must withdraw from all\r\npending competencias and the cases be carried to conclusion by the\r\nAudiencia. The Suprema must have consented unwillingly to this, for it\r\nlabored with the wavering monarch and, on November 8th, he wrote\r\nwithdrawing the cédula and ordering the suspension of all cases before\r\nthe Audiencia. A few weeks later he yielded to other influences and\r\nannulled the last letter, but added that his orders of September 30th\r\nmust be executed impartially, for the Inquisition complained that it was\r\nenforced only against its officials and in such case he would give it a\r\nfree hand again. December 27th the Suprema sent this to the Valencia\r\ntribunal with formal instructions to obey it, but added a confidential\r\nletter saying that efforts would not be relaxed to persuade the king to\r\nremit all such cases back to them; meanwhile an agreement had been\r\nobtained from the Council of Aragon that all sentences by the Audiencia\r\nshould be referred to it before execution and the tribunal must watch\r\nthem closely and send such reports as would enable the Suprema to obtain\r\nfavorable action on them.[994]\r\n\r\nFor this endless strife, for the habitual disregard of the laws by\r\nfamiliars, the Suprema was primarily responsible. It was perfectly\r\nacquainted with the innumerable edicts specifying prohibited weapons and\r\nforbidding the carrying of them after night-fall; it acquiesced,\r\nostensibly at least, in the subjection of these offences to the royal\r\ncourts and yet it encouraged familiars in the belief that it had power\r\nto override all laws and could confer licence to violate them. The\r\nformula of commission which it caused to be issued to familiars\r\ncontained a clause granting them full liberty to carry arms, offensive\r\nand defensive, publicly and secretly, by day or by night, and ordering\r\nall secular officials to abstain from interference with them, in virtue\r\nof holy obedience and under penalty of excommunication and of fifty\r\nthousand maravedís applicable to the expenses of the Holy Office.[995]\r\nIt could not be fuller or more explicit; there are no exceptions as to\r\nthe character of arms or allusion to the jurisdiction in these cases\r\ngranted by the king to the royal courts. When one branch of the\r\ngovernment thus resolutely placed itself in opposition to the sovereign\r\nand encouraged its subordinates to resist the laws and the constituted\r\nauthorities, peace was impossible and conflicts were inevitable. Yet the\r\nillegality of all this was admitted when, in 1634, the familiars of\r\nValencia held a meeting to assess themselves for a donation to be\r\noffered to the king, in return for a privilege to bear arms, and the\r\nSuprema instructed the tribunal to aid the movement, and again when, in\r\n1638, a fruitless offer was made by them of twelve thousand ducats for\r\nthe revocation of legislation on the subject.[996]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BEARING ARMS_]\r\n\r\nTo crown all this, the Suprema, in 1657, reached the audacity of arguing\r\nthat the right of familiars to bear arms was imprescriptible and could\r\nnot be abrogated by any prince, for it would impede the Inquisition in\r\nthe free exercise of its functions, wherefore it denied that any\r\ncompetencia could be formed in such cases; the secular authorities had\r\nno jurisdiction and there could not even be a discussion about their\r\nclaim to interfere.[997] Philip IV had the weakness to submit to these\r\nextravagant claims, in 1658, and to decide that the Suprema alone had\r\ncognizance in such matters. The case in which this occurred was that of\r\nJaime Espejo, alcaide of the penitential prison of Valencia, arrested\r\nfor carrying pistols and it has interest for us because in it the\r\ninquisitor, Don Antonio de Ayala Verganza, argues away all the royal\r\ndecrees and pragmáticas as not meaning what they said and proves it by\r\nciting a vast number of cases in which, when carried up to the king, he\r\noverruled his own legislation, invariably deciding in favor of the\r\nInquisition and against his own jurisdiction. He could sometimes be\r\nbrought to issue wholesome general regulations, but, when it came to\r\ntheir execution, the ever-present dread of interfering with the service\r\nof God overwhelmed him.[998]\r\n\r\nYet Philip promptly reversed himself for, in a despairing effort to put\r\nan end to these interminable quarrels, he was induced to issue a royal\r\nletter, December 23, 1659, declaring that the cognizance of infractions\r\nof the laws respecting prohibited arms lay with the royal jurisdiction\r\nand that no competencias should be formed in these cases. When this\r\nletter was alleged by the royal court, in the case then pending of\r\nJoseph Navarro, a familiar arrested for carrying a pistol, the\r\nInquisition in reply airily cast aside the pragmática of 1613, and its\r\nconfirmation in 1633, by asserting that both before and after those laws\r\nit had always exercised jurisdiction over these cases, as was notorious\r\nto every one--which was all doubtless true. As for the recent letter of\r\n1659, it had not been issued with the assent of the Suprema; being thus\r\nirregularly issued it should not be regarded as valid, until the king\r\nshould be supplicated to modify it, and until this was done the accused\r\nshould be surrendered to it or he could be released under bail to both\r\njurisdictions.[999] The vacillating monarch probably yielded again;\r\nwhether he did so or not mattered little to the Holy Office, which\r\nregarded his decrees so lightly. The miserable business of quarrelling\r\nover the multiplication of the laws went on and, in 1691, Carlos II\r\nfound it necessary again to prohibit the carrying of pistols and _armas\r\ncortas_ and to deprive offenders of their claims to jurisdiction, even\r\nif they were familiars or salaried officials of the Inquisition.[1000]\r\n\r\nSeveral cases in the earlier years of Philip V seem to indicate that\r\nthis matter was an exception to the general limitation of the privileges\r\nof the Holy Office and that there was a tendency to admit its\r\nclaims.[1001] Their final extinction, however, was not far off. In 1748,\r\nFernando VI prohibited all officials of tribunals, including the\r\nInquisition, from carrying cut-and-thrust weapons any kind; exclusive\r\njurisdiction in the enforcement of this was reserved for the secular\r\ncourts and all claims to _fuero_ were abolished. He confirmed and\r\nextended this by proclamations of 1749, 1751 and 1754, with penalties\r\nof six years in the mines for commoners and six years service in\r\npresidio for nobles. In another of 1757 he regretted the non-observance\r\nof these laws and ordered their irremissible enforcement without\r\nprivilege of fuero. This legislation was supplemented by Carlos III, in\r\n1761, who included in the prohibition all fire-arms of less than four\r\npalms length of barrel, although he conceded to gentlemen the use of\r\nholster pistols when on horseback but not when on mule-back.[1002] Yet\r\nthe Inquisition continued to issue the old form of commissions granting\r\nunlimited license, until the magistrates of Seville and Alcalá la Real\r\nrefused to recognize them when, in 1777, it admitted its altered\r\nposition by a modification which granted the right to carry\r\nnon-prohibited weapons, but only when on duty for the Holy Office, and\r\ncontented itself with exhorting the secular authorities not to interfere\r\nwith this.[1003]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MILITARY SERVICE_]\r\n\r\nIn somewhat ludicrous contrast with the belligerent spirit, indicated by\r\nthe earnest desire to carry arms, was the claim that all connected with\r\nthe Inquisition were exempt from military service. In its relations with\r\nthe State the Holy Office recognized no duties of citizenship; it only\r\nclaimed privileges. That the salaried officials, regularly employed in\r\nthe tribunals, should enjoy such exemptions was merely in accordance\r\nwith old custom, for a law of Juan II, in 1432, specifically released\r\nfrom the obligation of service nearly all officials, including even\r\nphysicians, surgeons and schoolmasters.[1004] That this should apply to\r\nthe Inquisition seems to have been assumed as a matter of course in its\r\nearly days but, in 1560, the corregidor of Córdova summoned the\r\nofficials and familiars to appear in the musters; they all claimed\r\nexemption, when the inquisitor-general upheld the appeal of the\r\nofficials but denied that of the familiars. Similar questions arose in\r\nMurcia in 1563 and 1575, in which a similar distinction was drawn.[1005]\r\nIn Valencia, the familiars had probably been more successful, for an\r\narticle in the Concordia of 1568 provides that they must serve their\r\nturns in guarding the coasts and that inquisitors shall not defend them\r\nin seeking exemptions under pretext of their office.[1006] The same\r\nquestion arose in Majorca and was settled by a law providing that\r\nfamiliars refusing to perform guard-duty on their appointed days could\r\nbe compelled by the royal officials.[1007] Thus by common consent at\r\nthis time salaried officials were exempted while the claims of familiars\r\nwere rejected.\r\n\r\nIn the troubles of the seventeenth century, when the very existence of\r\nSpain was threatened, the question as to officials as well as familiars\r\ncame up again and the Suprema sought to protect both classes. In 1636\r\nand 1638, the corregidors of various cities refused to except the\r\nofficials when making up the lists for conscription, but Philip IV\r\ndecided that they were exempt.[1008] As the danger increased, in 1640,\r\nwith the rebellions in Catalonia and Portugal, and the resources of the\r\nkingdom were strained to the utmost, all claims were disregarded. By a\r\ncédula of September 7, 1641, Philip declared this to be a religious war,\r\nas the rebels were allied with nations infected with heresy. Inquisitor\r\ngeneral Sotomayor was required to summon all officials and familiars to\r\norganize and serve and was clothed with power to enforce it. No protest\r\nwas made against this, for it was a financial rather than a military\r\nmove; arrangements were made to commute service for cash and the Suprema\r\nwas thus aided in meeting the royal demands for contributions.[1009]\r\n\r\nThis was only a temporary truce. Philip, in a letter of February 22,\r\n1644, to Inquisitor-general Arce y Reynoso, reported that the attitude\r\nof the officials had excited much dissatisfaction in Galicia; he\r\ntherefore ordered that no exemptions be admitted and no excuses be\r\nreceived. To this the Suprema responded with bitter complaints that in\r\nSaragossa the lot had fallen on a messenger of the tribunal and the\r\nwidow of a notary, who were told that they must furnish substitutes, all\r\nof which was in violation of the privileges of the Inquisition,\r\ncrippling it in its pious labors so essential to the faith and reducing\r\nit in popular esteem to a level with other institutions. Unstable as\r\nusual where the Holy Office was concerned, Philip abandoned his position\r\nand admitted that salaried officials were not liable to serve or to\r\nfurnish substitutes, which the Suprema promptly conveyed to the\r\ntribunals, cautioning them not to employ excommunication in collisions\r\nwith the royal officials until after obtaining its permission.[1010]\r\n\r\nEven in this hour of supreme need the liability of familiars was\r\ncontested. Philip endeavored to placate the Suprema by assigning them to\r\ngarrison duty, but it remonstrated, asserting that the Inquisition could\r\nnot perform its functions if wholly deprived of them, and the cause of\r\nreligion was higher than any other. It therefore asked that no place\r\nshould be left without one, in small towns there should be two and in\r\nlarger places four. To this Philip assented, on condition that those\r\nexempted should contribute to those who served, but the Suprema\r\ndemurred; every one could avoid service who could pay the assessment, so\r\nthis would be giving the familiars no special privileges; there could be\r\nno question that favors shown to the Inquisition would contribute to\r\nsuccess in the war, for experience had demonstrated that the more\r\nsovereigns had fostered it the more fortunate they had been. However\r\njust was the argument it was fruitless; Philip adhered to his decision,\r\nbut when the corresponding decrees were issued, the Council of Castile\r\nremonstrated in its turn and the distracted monarch was involved in a\r\nfresh discussion between the two.[1011]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RIGHT TO HOLD PUBLIC OFFICE_]\r\n\r\nThe Suprema carried its point that those exempted should not contribute\r\nto those conscripted and the arrangement remained in force. It was\r\nrepeated in a _carta acordada_ of January 14, 1668, and, when, in 1681,\r\na question arose in Tembleque, the Suprema cautioned the Toledo tribunal\r\nnot to issue more letters of exemption than the settlement permitted, in\r\norder to avoid competencias which only serve to render the Holy Office\r\nhateful and to imperil its other privileges.[1012] Carlos III seems to\r\nhave been more liberal when, in 1767, he included, in an elaborate list\r\nof those exempt from military service, the ministers and dependents of\r\nthe Inquisition who were relieved from billets under the decree of May\r\n26, 1728, which, it will be remembered, granted the privilege to the\r\nnumber of familiars allowed under the old Concordias. Carlos IV was\r\nmore exacting for, in 1800, when regulating the conscription in minute\r\ndetail, he granted exemption only to the titular officials and took\r\nspecial care to exclude familiars and other dependents.[1013] This\r\ncontinued to the end. September 14, 1818, the Suprema communicated to\r\nthe tribunals a decision of the king that, in order to secure exemption\r\nfrom conscription, it was not necessary to exhibit a royal commission,\r\nbut one from the inquisitor-general or Suprema sufficed.[1014] Evidently\r\nthe local tribunals were no longer allowed to issue certificates of\r\nexemption.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe right of officials and familiars to hold secular offices raised\r\nquestions that caused no little debate. It was evidently of advantage to\r\nthe Inquisition that those who were bound to it and enjoyed its\r\nexemptions should be in positions of influence where they could guard\r\nits privileges and promote their extension. On the other hand, for these\r\nvery reasons, the people were jealous of office-holding by its ministers\r\nand dreaded to have their local authorities relieved of responsibility\r\nthrough their claim on the _fuero_ or jurisdiction of the Inquisition.\r\nHad these local positions been elective, popular good sense could have\r\naverted the danger, but they were awarded by lot, the names of those\r\ndeemed eligible being placed in a _bolsa_ or bag--a process known as\r\n_insaculacion_--and drawn forth.[1015]\r\n\r\nThe earliest instance I have met of a refusal to include officials of\r\nthe Inquisition among the eligibles occurs in 1503, when Ferdinand wrote\r\nto his Lieutenant-general of Majorca that he was astonished to learn\r\nthat the names of Pere Prat, his son Pere Prat, Carman Litra and\r\nGerónimo Serma had not been insacculated because they held office in the\r\nInquisition; it should rather be a recommendation; they must not be thus\r\ndishonored and their names must at once be put in the bolsa.[1016]\r\nDoubtless Ferdinand's watchfulness preserved this privilege for\r\nofficials during his life, but subsequently popular feeling must have\r\nmanifested itself by their exclusion, for, in 1523, Charles V forbade\r\nit in an edict and he followed this by a special pragmática, May 30,\r\n1524, asserting their eligibility to public office in all his dominions\r\nand for all future time, under pain of the royal wrath and of two\r\nthousand florins, but he provided that they should not be entitled to\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Inquisition for official malfeasance.[1017]\r\nNotwithstanding this, Philip II was obliged to issue special\r\ninstructions on the subject to Sardinia in 1552 and to Navarre in\r\n1558.[1018]\r\n\r\nIn this, as in so much else, the Catalans were especially intractable.\r\nCórtes of the three kingdoms of Aragon were held in 1553, in which\r\nCatalonia alone took up the matter and adopted a law, confirmed by\r\nPrince Philip, prescribing that no bayle or his lieutenant, or judge, or\r\nscrivener could be a familiar, nor could he accept office after his term\r\nof service had expired.[1019] This received scant obedience, nor did the\r\nInquisition pay attention to the clause in the pragmática of 1524\r\ndepriving it of cognizance of official malfeasance. One of the\r\ncomplaints of the royal Audiencia to de Soto Salazar, in his visitation\r\nof the Barcelona tribunal in 1566, was that it assumed jurisdiction in\r\nall such cases. Salazar recommended that this should be forbidden, for\r\nit impeded the proper administration of the towns, and officials could\r\nnot be punished for violating local ordinances about bread, vineyards,\r\nmeadows, breaking irrigating canals to water their lands, and\r\nmultitudinous other derelictions.[1020]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RIGHT TO HOLD PUBLIC OFFICE_]\r\n\r\nCatalonia refused to accept the Concordia of 1568 and, in 1585, the\r\nCórtes re-enacted the provisions of 1553 in an enlarged form, including\r\nalmost all offices, and subjecting violation to a penalty of two hundred\r\nducats, which was confirmed by Philip II.[1021] This seems to have been\r\nenforced for, in 1586, a memorial from the Bishop of Segovia says that\r\nin Catalonia the names of all officials of the Inquisition were removed\r\nfrom the lists of eligibles, that commissioners and familiars were\r\nresigning and that every day withdrawals were received from applicants,\r\nso that the tribunal would be crippled and the Córtes could have\r\ncontrived nothing more damaging.[1022] The Catalans held good, despite\r\nthe earnest efforts of the Holy Office, which declared long afterwards\r\nthat this was the severest blow that it had ever received. In the Córtes\r\nof 1599 the battle was renewed after elaborate preparations by the\r\ninquisitors. On June 30th the king presented a series of articles, in\r\nresponse to those submitted to him by the Córtes, and among them was one\r\ndeclaring officials and familiars eligible to all offices, but the\r\nCatalans would have none of it. In the elaborate memorial presented to\r\nClement VIII by the Suprema against the work of the Córtes, it\r\ncomplained bitterly of the laws of 1553 and 1585 as diminishing notably\r\nthe authority of the Inquisition and causing great lack of officials, so\r\nmany having ignominiously resigned, while others could not be found to\r\nreplace them.[1023]\r\n\r\nAgain, when the Córtes were about to assemble in 1626, the Barcelona\r\ntribunal implored the Suprema to use its utmost exertions for the repeal\r\nof the law of 1585, for no person of consideration would accept office\r\nand it was obliged to appoint those of low condition, which was fatal to\r\nits authority. The Córtes yielded in so far as to adopt an article\r\nthrowing open the offices, provided incumbents were justiciable by the\r\ncivil courts for a long series of offences, but the whole legislation of\r\nthe Córtes came to naught through lack of the royal confirmation.[1024]\r\nWhen the question was coming up again in the Córtes of 1632, earnest\r\nappeals were made to the Suprema to have the obnoxious law of 1585\r\nrepealed. The condition of the Inquisition in Catalonia was represented\r\nas most deplorable by reason of it. In a memorial to the king it was\r\nstated that in Barcelona there were but four or five familiars, and they\r\nwere mechanics, ineligible to public office; there was not a single\r\nadvocate of the accused, nor an ecclesiastical consultor, so greedy was\r\nevery one for public office. Throughout the principality there was the\r\nsame dearth--familiars only in miserable villages, destitute of tempting\r\npositions, and those were of base condition, for in fact the barons\r\nwould endure none other in their lands. The Suprema was urged to bring\r\nthe matter before the Rota and it submitted the question to its fiscal,\r\nbut he wisely reported that, although a favorable result was to be\r\nanticipated, yet it was expedient to set the example of recourse to Rome\r\nwhich might result in other matters being carried thither with damage to\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Holy Office.[1025]\r\n\r\nThus Catalan pertinacity triumphed. When, in 1667, Pedro Momparler,\r\nfamiliar at Alconer, asked permission to resign, in order to accept the\r\noffice of bayle, and his request was referred to the Suprema, it replied\r\nthat it should be denied on account of the evil influence of his\r\nexample, but it added that if he should renounce his familiarship before\r\nthe royal justice for the term of his office, the inquisitors should\r\npretend ignorance.[1026]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RIGHT TO HOLD PUBLIC OFFICE_]\r\n\r\nIn Majorca, frequent alterations of the law show that it was subject to\r\nactive debate and that preponderance shifted from one side to the other.\r\nIn 1637 it was decided that none of those connected with the Inquisition\r\ncould hold public office; then, in 1643, they were allowed to do so, in\r\npositions where they had not to vote or to give counsel; again, in 1660,\r\nthe prohibition was made absolute; then, in 1662, royal letters of\r\nJanuary 11th and March 4th removed the prohibition, provided they would\r\npreviously renounce all claim to the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.\r\nThese letters afford a remarkable illustration of the vacillation of the\r\nmonarch and of the extent to which bureaucracy had crippled his\r\nautocracy--only this time it was the Council of Aragon which imitated\r\nthe methods of the Suprema. The latter body was dissatisfied with the\r\narrangement and addressed to the king a consulta, April 5, 1663, asking\r\nits suspension and that a junta of the two councils should be called to\r\nconsider the subject. Philip promptly acceded and, on April 10th,\r\nordered the Council of Aragon to write to that effect to the viceroy.\r\nThe command was not obeyed and, on September 19th, the Suprema asked him\r\nto remedy the omission, whereupon he asked the council to state its\r\nreasons and, on its doing so, he again ordered it, October 3d, to\r\nexecute his decree of April 10th. It was still recalcitrant and, on\r\nMarch 19, 1664, the Suprema represented the delay to the king who the\r\nnext day called upon the council to render an exact account of what it\r\nhad done, replied that in conformity with his commands it had written on\r\nOctober 3, 1663, copy of which it enclosed. This proved to be merely\r\ncopies of the letters of 1662 which had given rise to the debate,\r\nshowing that it had deliberately nullified his orders. In view of all\r\nthis the Suprema, July 24, 1664, asked the king to insist on literal\r\ncompliance and that a copy of the despatch of the Council of Aragon to\r\nthe viceroy should be furnished to it. This proved to be merely a\r\nduplicate of that of October 13, 1663, with the date altered to April 6,\r\n1664. Then the Suprema again asked the king peremptorily to order exact\r\nobedience and he replied that he had done so. Meanwhile the Viceroy and\r\nthe inquisitor of Majorca had been playing at cross-purposes in\r\nconsequence of the contradictory despatches received by each.[1027] Such\r\na method of carrying on an organized government seems incredible and,\r\ntrivial as was the question at issue, a case such as this throws light\r\non one of the causes of Spanish decadence. The question itself, after\r\nall this trouble, apparently remained unsettled, for, in 1673, there was\r\na competencia over Gabriel Berga, a knight of Santiago and a familiar,\r\nwhen the tribunal contended that he could not renounce its\r\njurisdiction.[1028]\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to follow out in detail the vicissitudes of this\r\nmatter in the other provinces of Spain, where it gave abundant occasion\r\nfor quarrels conducted with customary vehemence. It seems to have\r\nsettled itself into the rule that officials and familiars were eligible\r\nto public office but that, during their terms of service, they were not\r\nentitled to the jurisdiction of the Inquisition. Such, we are told in\r\n1632, was the practice in Castile, Aragon and Valencia.[1029] Yet still\r\nthere were disputes for, about the middle of the seventeenth century, a\r\nformula is given for use when a familiar is prevented from taking\r\noffice. This sets forth at much length that, if familiars are refused\r\noffice, no one will take the position, which will inflict great\r\ndetriment on the faith; it cites the royal cédulas, it sets aside\r\nopposing arguments by showing that for all malfeasance in office the\r\nfamiliar will be subject to the royal jurisdiction and finally it orders\r\nhis immediate induction in his post under penalty of excommunication and\r\nof five hundred ducats; no further notice will be given and all further\r\naction will be published in the halls of the Inquisition, which will be\r\nfull legal notice to all parties concerned.[1030] I have met with no\r\nfurther legislation on the subject and presumably some arrangement of\r\nthis kind was in force to the end.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was highly inconsistent but, at the same time, thoroughly in keeping\r\nwith the spirit of the Inquisition in its dealings with the public, that\r\nwhile it vindicated so energetically the right of its officials to hold\r\nhonorable and lucrative posts, it claimed for them the privilege to\r\nrefuse to serve in those which were onerous. In the municipalities there\r\nwere a certain number of these latter, entailing unremunerative labor\r\nand responsibility which no one could refuse to accept when his name was\r\ndrawn from the bolsa. The officials claimed to be insaculated for the\r\ndesirable positions but not for the undesirable ones. That such a claim\r\ncould be made and sustained is a forcible illustration of the power of\r\nthe Inquisition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RIGHT TO REFUSE OFFICE_]\r\n\r\nThere is no allusion to this in the earlier Concordias and no specific\r\ngrant that I have been able to find. It seems to have been merely a\r\ngratuitous assumption on the part of the Inquisition, asserted with its\r\ncustomary persistence. A noteworthy case growing out of it occurred, in\r\n1622, in the town of Lorca (Murcia) where a familiar refused to serve in\r\nthe office of collector of the alcavala, or tax on sales, and was\r\nimprisoned for contumacy. The inquisitors of Murcia demanded his\r\nliberation and excommunicated the alcalde mayor for refusing to obey.\r\nThis failing, they prepared to arrest him and called upon the corregidor\r\nof Murcia, Pedro de Porres, for assistance. On his refusal they\r\nexcommunicated him and then laid an interdict on the city of Murcia. The\r\ncitizens appealed to their bishop, Fray Antonio Trejo, who remonstrated\r\nwith the tribunal and, finding this unavailing, issued an edict\r\ndeclaring the interdict invalid. Bishops were not subject to\r\ninquisitorial jurisdiction, even for heresy, without special papal\r\nfaculties, but the inquisitor-general, Andres Pacheco, was the most\r\naudacious and inexorable assertor of inquisitorial omnipotence and he\r\ndid not hesitate to condemn the episcopal edict, to publish the\r\ncondemnation in all the churches, to fine the bishop in eight thousand\r\nducats and to summon him, under pain of four thousand more, to appear\r\nwithin twenty days and answer to the action brought against him by the\r\nfiscal as an impeder of the Inquisition. The bishop and chapter sent the\r\ndean and a canon to represent them, but, without a hearing, they were\r\nthrown _incomunicado_ into the secret prison, excommunicated and the\r\ncensure published in all the churches. The inquisitors imprisoned the\r\nparish priest of Santa Catalina for disregarding the interdict and the\r\nwhole ecclesiastical body of Murcia became involved. Finally, through\r\nthe intervention of the king and the pope, the bishop was absolved, but\r\nthe Inquisition reaped a rich harvest of fines. Those of the bishop,\r\ndean and some of the canons were kept by the Suprema, while the local\r\ntribunal, in addition to inflicting terms of exile, of from one to eight\r\nyears, secured from José Lucas, the episcopal secretary, a thousand\r\nducats, from Alonso Pedriñan, the fiscal, eight hundred and, from\r\nthirteen other priests and dignitaries of the church, sums ranging from\r\nfifty to one hundred and fifty--in all, an aggregate of 3272\r\nducats.[1031]\r\n\r\nA claim enforced so relentlessly was dangerous to dispute and even the\r\nAragonese Concordia of 1646, which registered a triumph over the Holy\r\nOffice, admitted the right of salaried officials and familiars to\r\ndecline onerous offices.[1032] In time, however, there seems to have\r\ncome a slight modification of the claim. About 1750 we have the formula\r\nof a mandate, issued at the instance of a familiar, forbidding, under\r\npain of excommunication and of two hundred ducats, the authorities of a\r\ntown from including him among those liable to serve in any of the minor\r\noffices, nor in any of the more important ones until every other\r\ninhabitant has served his turn.[1033]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to understand the origin of the claim that the\r\nbuildings of the Inquisition and the houses of its officials were\r\nsanctuaries into which the officers of justice could not penetrate\r\nwithout special permission. The asylum afforded to criminals in churches\r\nwas an old established practice throughout Europe to which Spain was no\r\nexception. Even as late as 1737 the papal sanction was deemed necessary\r\nto except from this certain crimes, such as murder, highway robbery and\r\nhigh treason.[1034] Asylum was also afforded by the feudal rights which\r\ndebarred royal officers of justice from intruding on lands of nobles,\r\nand the withdrawal of this right in Granada is cited as one of the\r\ncauses of the agitation leading to the rebellion of 1568.[1035] In\r\nAragon this was developed so far that a law of Jaime I, in the Córtes of\r\nHuesca in 1247, which still continued in force, gave to the houses of\r\ninfanzones, or gentlemen, the same right of asylum as that possessed by\r\nchurches.[1036]\r\n\r\nIt is therefore somewhat remarkable that the claim of affording asylum\r\nwas not made at the outset by the Inquisition, especially in view of the\r\nimportance attached to the secrecy which shrouded all its operations.\r\nYet, until the middle of the sixteenth century, such claims when made\r\nwere authoritatively repudiated. Inquisitor-general Tavera writes,\r\nSeptember 3, 1540, a sharp letter to the inquisitors of Seville saying\r\nthat he is informed that recently certain murderers had been received\r\nand protected in the castle of Triana, occupied by the tribunal, and\r\nthat the officers of the royal justice had not been allowed to search\r\nfor them; the punishment of delinquents should be in no way impeded and\r\nno occasion be given for complaint; the gates of the castle must be kept\r\nshut so that criminals cannot take refuge there.[1037] So, in 1546,\r\namong instructions from the Suprema to the tribunal of Granada, is an\r\norder that no criminals or debtors shall find refuge in the Inquisition,\r\nnor be allowed to sleep there nor between the gates; the janitor must\r\neject them and, if they will not go, report it to the inquisitors for\r\nproper action.[1038] This shows that the abuse was commencing but that\r\nit was disapproved and the same is seen in the Valencia Concordia of\r\n1554, which says that, as the Inquisition has no privileges as an\r\nasylum, it cannot protect those who take refuge there.[1039]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RIGHT OF ASYLUM_]\r\n\r\nEvidently the local tribunals were claiming a right which the central\r\nauthority disallowed; they were moreover claiming it not only for the\r\nbuilding of the Inquisition but for the houses of officials and\r\nfamiliars. Among the malfeasances of the Barcelona tribunal, reported in\r\n1567 by de Soto Salazar, were cases of this kind. When the bayle of\r\nPerpignan sought to arrest some culprits they were sheltered by Pedro de\r\nRoca, a familiar, in his house and he resisted the bayle who came with a\r\nposse to arrest them; Roca accused the bayle and his men for this; they\r\nwere imprisoned for a long while by the Barcelona inquisitors and were\r\ncondemned to fines and exile. So when the bayle of Sens, with a posse,\r\nbroke into the house of Vicente Valele, who was merely a temporary\r\ncommissioner, to arrest some culprits who had taken refuge there, he\r\naccused them and they were all imprisoned.[1040]\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the abuse developed in Valencia is manifested by\r\na comparison of the Concordias of 1554 and 1568. The former, as we have\r\nseen, admits that the Inquisition could offer no asylum, while the\r\nlatter is obliged to forbid the lower officials and familiars from\r\nputting the arms of the Inquisition on their houses; all such must be\r\nremoved and their houses shall not have immunity from the officers of\r\njustice--evidently the officials found profit in harboring thieves and\r\nmurderers and the tribunal supported them.[1041] In Barcelona a sort of\r\ncompromise was reached by which, on application to the tribunal, one of\r\nits ministers was sent with the officers of justice to enter houses of\r\nofficials where criminals had taken refuge, but the Córtes of 1599\r\ncomplained that this delay afforded time for escape and, in the abortive\r\nConcordia enacted there, a clause provided that this should not be\r\nnecessary and that, in case of resistance, houses could be entered. It\r\nshows how slow was the Suprema to assert a right of asylum that, in its\r\nprotest to Clement VIII, it accepts this article on the ground that the\r\nInquisition never has impeded the pursuit and arrest of\r\nmalefactors.[1042] In time, however, it overcame these scruples and, in\r\n1632, it issued repeated orders that the officers of justice should not\r\nbe allowed to enter the houses of officials. Philip IV countermanded\r\nthis, but the Suprema presented a consulta saying that there was no\r\nobjection when the pursuit was _flagrante delicto_; prisoners, however,\r\nwere frequently confined in the houses of officials and an unlimited\r\nright of entry might be abused to obtain communication with them in\r\nviolation of the all-important secrecy of the Holy Office. As usual, the\r\nvacillating monarch yielded and, in 1634, issued a decree restricting\r\nthe right of search to cases of hot pursuit.[1043]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the Aragonese Concordia of 1646, imposed by the\r\nCórtes on Philip, which in so many ways restricted the privileges of the\r\nInquisition, recognized this doubtful one in the fullest manner. As the\r\nministers, it says, of so holy an office should enjoy certain honors and\r\npre-eminence, it orders that they, including familiars, shall have as to\r\ntheir houses the same privileges as caballeros and hijosdalgo--which, as\r\nwe have seen, included the right of asylum.[1044] As regards the\r\nbuildings of the Inquisition itself, a scandalous case occurring in 1638\r\nshows how far it had travelled since Tavera rebuked the tribunal of\r\nSeville. In Majorca the Count of Ayamano, at the head of a band of\r\nassassins, committed the sacrilege of escalading the walls of a convent\r\nfor the purpose of murdering his wife who had sought refuge there.\r\nPhilip ordered every effort made to arrest him and his accomplices, but\r\nhe escaped to Barcelona with eight of them and all found asylum in the\r\nInquisition, in the apartments of his uncle, the Inquisitor Cotoner. It\r\naffords a curious insight into the conditions of the period to see that\r\nthis created a situation impenetrable to the highest authorities of the\r\nland. Philip called a junta of two members each of the Suprema and\r\nCouncil of Aragon to devise how the criminals could be captured without\r\nscandal or quarrel with the Inquisition. The result of their\r\ndeliberations seems to be a letter from the Suprema to Cotoner telling\r\nhim that, if he wanted to help his nephew, it should be outside and not\r\ninside of the Inquisition, in order to avoid the troubles ensuing on an\r\nattempt of the royal officers to remove him. The imperturbable Cotoner\r\nwas not to be scared by this gentle warning and a fortnight later the\r\nSuprema enclosed to him a royal decree telling him that he would see the\r\nuntoward results of sheltering his nephew. As complete satisfaction was\r\ndemanded he was ordered to report in full all details, including his\r\nmotives in harboring one who was put to the ban, especially when the\r\nlatter was not a familiar.[1045] Unfortunately we do not know how the\r\naffair ended, but when the Suprema, in place of dismissing Cotoner,\r\ninquired as to his motives, we may assume that the asylum offered by the\r\nInquisition saved the forfeit life of the criminal by some compromise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RIGHT OF ASYLUM_]\r\n\r\nThe immunity of the houses of officials became generally recognized,\r\nwith the proviso that permission of search would be granted by\r\ninquisitors if special application was made to them, when they preserved\r\ntheir jurisdiction by sending one of their people to accompany the\r\nofficers of justice. An exception which proved the rule however was made\r\nin favor of the administrators of the tax on tobacco, to whom general\r\nletters were given empowering them to search the houses of officials for\r\ncontraband tobacco. Even this was argued away by the Suprema in 1728,\r\nwhen it asserted that semi-proof in advance was necessary to justify\r\nsearch and full proof to give jurisdiction.[1046]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the above that the Holy Office, with its claims for\r\nspecial privileges and exemptions and its methods for enforcing their\r\nrecognition, was a very disturbing factor in the body politic. Yet the\r\ngreatest source of conflict lay in the exclusive jurisdiction which it\r\nsought to establish over all who were connected with it, not only\r\nbetween themselves but between them and the rest of the community. This\r\nengrossed so large a portion of its activity and was the cause of such\r\nperpetually recurring trouble that its consideration requires a chapter\r\nto itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCONFLICTING JURISDICTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal source of strife between the Inquisition and the other\r\nauthorities arose from its claim to exclusive competence in all cases\r\ninvolving those connected with it and their dependents. This gave rise\r\nto perpetual conflicts, conducted with the utmost tenacity, which filled\r\nthe land with confusion and, in many cases, rendered the administration\r\nof justice a mockery. For two centuries the monarchs vainly endeavored\r\nto keep the peace by repeated efforts to define the boundaries between\r\nthe rival jurisdictions and the methods of settling their differences.\r\nThe tireless efforts, on the one side, of the Holy Office to extend its\r\nauthority and increase its emoluments caused it constantly to violate\r\ncompacts, while the jealousy of the civil magistracy on the other and\r\nits natural desire to repel intrusion rendered it prompt to use whatever\r\nmeans lay in its power. The struggle was unequal against the superior\r\nweapons furnished by papal faculties and against the royal favor which\r\nwas with the Inquisition, but the conflict was maintained with\r\nmarvellous constancy, supported by popular sympathy, and the time of the\r\nking and his advisers was frittered away in deciding a continuous stream\r\nof petty quarrels, growing out of trivial incidents, but assuming\r\nportentous proportions through the violent methods which had aggravated\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTo understand the claim of the Inquisition to exclusive cognizance of\r\nthe cases of its subordinates it is necessary to bear in mind the\r\nbenefit of clergy, through which, from the early middle ages, all\r\nclerics were exempted from the jurisdiction of the laity and were\r\nsubjected wholly to the spiritual courts. This amounted virtually to\r\nimmunity for crime, both because those courts were debarred from\r\nrendering judgements of blood and because of the inevitable favoritism\r\nmanifested to those of their own cloth.[1047] As civilization advanced\r\nthe disorders caused by a class, thus emboldened in wrong-doing by\r\nimpunity, were the source of constant solicitude to rulers and were\r\ndeplored by right-thinking churchmen. In this, Spain was no exception.\r\nIn a project of instructions drawn up by a Spanish bishop for the\r\ndelegates to the Lateran Council in 1512, the crimes and scandals\r\nperpetrated by married clerks and those in the lower orders, through\r\nexpectation of immunity, are dwelt upon as reasons for a change; there\r\nwere daily conflicts between the spiritual and secular courts, leading\r\nto interdicts cast on cities and some universal legislation by the\r\nChurch was desirable.[1048] No such remedy was adopted, and when the\r\nCouncil of Trent gave promise of reform, the Spanish prelates, in\r\ncontrast with the Inquisition, which made every effort to extend its\r\njurisdiction over offenders, proposed in 1562 to the council that\r\nmarried clerks wearing secular habits should not enjoy protection from\r\nsecular justice.[1049] In 1544, Fernando de Aragon, when Viceroy of\r\nValencia, declared that his principal trouble lay with the Church, of\r\nwhich the chief object was to protect evil-doers and liberate them from\r\nhis justice, an opinion in which he was heartily seconded by the saintly\r\nTomás de Vilanova, then recently appointed archbishop.[1050]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LATITUDE IN SECULAR AFFAIRS_]\r\n\r\nYet the marked aversion in Spain to ecclesiastical encroachment led to\r\nrepeated enactments restraining spiritual jurisdiction within strict\r\nlimits. In a series of laws, dating from the fourteenth to the sixteenth\r\ncentury, Henry II, Juan II, Henry IV, Ferdinand and Isabella and Charles\r\nV endeavored by the severest penalties to repress its inevitable\r\ntendency to extend itself, whether by seizure of the persons or property\r\nof the laity or by entertaining cases between laymen. Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, in 1493, even threatened half confiscation and perpetual exile\r\nfrom Spain for all who, under any pretext, aided ecclesiastical judges\r\nin taking prisoners from secular officials or who assisted them in any\r\nway.[1051] In addition to this was the _recurso de fuerza_ through which\r\nappeal lay to the royal courts or to the _Sala de Gobierno_ whenever the\r\nspiritual courts refused an appeal or heard secular cases or those in\r\nwhich laymen were concerned.[1052] It is necessary to bear in mind this\r\ntendency and these restrictions on ecclesiastical jurisdiction to\r\nestimate properly the latitude obtained by the Inquisition in purely\r\nsecular affairs.\r\n\r\nWhether, at its inception, the Inquisition enjoyed the prerogative of\r\nexclusive cognizance of cases involving its officials it would be\r\nimpossible now to say. They were mostly laymen and as such were subject\r\nto the secular courts, while, in the popular opposition elicited by\r\ntheir proceedings, especially in the Aragonese kingdoms, there might be\r\nanticipated danger that they would be terrorized or prosecuted unless\r\nprotected by being reserved for judgement by their own tribunals. The\r\nearliest mandate to this effect that I have met is a cédula of\r\nFerdinand, March 26, 1488, addressed to all the officers of justice in\r\nCatalonia ordering them, under penalty of two thousand florins and the\r\nroyal wrath, to take no cognizance of anything concerning the ministers\r\nand familiars of the Inquisition; all their acts in such cases are\r\ndeclared invalid, and any one whom they may have arrested is at once to\r\nbe transferred to the tribunal, showing that, at least in Catalonia, no\r\nsuch exemption from secular justice had previously been\r\nrecognized.[1053]\r\n\r\nYet in this unlimited decree Ferdinand had overlooked details which\r\nnecessarily presented themselves in practice. Was this exemption from\r\nsecular jurisdiction confined to the _titulados y asalariados_ or did it\r\nextend to the unsalaried commissioners and familiars, receiving no pay,\r\npursuing their customary avocations and only called upon for occasional\r\nservice? There was also a question about the servants of officials, for\r\nan abuse of the spiritual courts had included those of clerics. Then it\r\nmight be asked whether the protection accorded to the person of the\r\nofficial extended to his property in civil suits, with the wide avenue\r\nthus opened to abuses of many kinds. There was, moreover, a well-settled\r\nprinciple of law that the accuser or plaintiff must seek the court of\r\nthe defendant; if, in violation of this, the official could enjoy what\r\nwas known as the active _fuero_ as well as the passive--that is, if he\r\nas plaintiff could bring suit or prosecution before his own\r\ntribunal--his power of offence would be vastly increased, together with\r\nhis opportunities for tyrannizing over all around him.\r\n\r\nThese were questions which had to be decided. It would seem that the\r\ninquisitors construed their powers in the most liberal fashion, giving\r\nrise to abuses which called for repression and a limitation of their\r\njurisdiction. The reformatory Instructions of 1498, accordingly, order\r\nthem not to defend officials and their servants in civil cases and only\r\nofficials in criminal actions, a rule repeated in a carta acordada of\r\nMay 4th of the same year.[1054] This excluded servants wholly and\r\ndeprived officials of the _fuero_ in civil matters, but it was soon\r\nmodified by Ferdinand, in a letter of January 12, 1500, to the Catalonia\r\ntribunal, ordering it not to interfere with the royal court in a certain\r\nsuit, and expressing the rule that the plaintiff must seek the court of\r\nthe defendant.[1055] It was impossible however to restrain inquisitors\r\nfrom exceeding their jurisdiction and he was obliged, August 20 1502, to\r\nrepeat his injunctions to the same tribunal, in consequence of\r\ncomplaints from the Diputados. The inquisitors were roundly taken to\r\ntask for lending themselves to the schemes of the receiver in buying up\r\ndebts and claims and then collecting them through the tribunal; they\r\nwere told that they must defend none but salaried officials actually in\r\nservice; if they are plaintiffs in civil suits they must apply to the\r\ncourt of the defendants, while if they are defendants the plaintiffs\r\nmust seek the tribunal. To evoke other cases, he says, causes great\r\nscandal and will lead to troubles which must be prevented. A fortnight\r\nlater he emphasized this about a civil case which they had evoked from\r\nthe royal court; they must remit it back and not have to be written to\r\nagain as he would not tolerate such proceedings.[1056] Thus familiars\r\nand servants were not entitled to the _fuero_, or inquisitorial\r\njurisdiction, while salaried officials enjoyed it, active and passive,\r\nin criminal actions and only passive in civil suits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _INTERFERENCE WITH COURSE OF JUSTICE_]\r\n\r\nUnduly favorable as was this to the Inquisition, the tribunals paid no\r\nattention to its limitations; they welcomed all who sought their\r\njudgement seat, and the desire for it of those who had no claim on it\r\nshows that they had a reputation of selling justice. One or two cases\r\nwill exemplify this and show how good were the grounds of complaint by\r\nthe people. There was a certain Juan de Sant Feliu of Murviedro, whose\r\nfather and mother-in-law had been condemned for heresy, and to whom\r\nFerdinand had kindly granted their confiscations, including the dowry of\r\nhis wife. In 1505 the town of Murviedro farmed out to him and his wife\r\nthe impost on meat for 11,100 sueldos a year; he died and, in the\r\nsettlement of his account, he was found to owe the town a hundred and\r\nfifty libras, which it proceeded to collect from his sons in the court\r\nof the governor. Under pretext that his property had been confiscated\r\nand restored, they appealed in 1511 to the tribunal of Valencia, which\r\npromptly evoked the case and inhibited the court from further action,\r\nwhereupon the town complained to Ferdinand who ordered the case remitted\r\nto the governor. Unabashed by this, in 1513, Sant Feliu's heirs on the\r\nsame pretext obtained the intervention of the tribunal in another case,\r\nin which Doña Violante de Borja had sued them for 7500 sueldos which she\r\nhad entrusted to him to invest in a censo of the town of Murviedro; the\r\ncenso had been paid off and he had concealed the fact and kept the\r\nmoney. Judgement was given against them, when the inquisitors interposed\r\nand prohibited the royal court from further action. Ferdinand expressed\r\nmuch indignation at their interference with justice in a matter wholly\r\nforeign to their jurisdiction and ordered the prohibition to be\r\nwithdrawn. Even more arbitrary was the action, in 1511, of the Majorca\r\ntribunal, when Pedro Tornamirandez sued the heirs of Francisco Ballester\r\nfor some cattle and obtained judgement in the court of the royal\r\nlieutenant, whereupon the heirs appealed to the inquisitor who evoked\r\nthe case and forbade further proceedings in the secular court. None of\r\nthe parties had any connection with the Inquisition and there was not\r\neven the pretext of confiscation; it was a mere wanton interference with\r\nthe course of justice, only explicable by some illicit gain, and when\r\nFerdinand's attention was called to it he ordered the inquisitor to\r\nrevoke his action.[1057] If, under Ferdinand's incessant vigilance the\r\nInquisition thus boldly prostituted its powers, we can appreciate how\r\nwell-founded, under his careless successors, were the complaints of\r\nthose who suffered under wrongs perpetrated under the pretence of\r\nserving God.\r\n\r\nIn the Catalan Concordia of 1512 there was an attempt to do away with\r\nsome of these abuses and the bull _Pastoralis officii_ of Leo X,\r\nconfirming the Concordia, marks another stage in the development of the\r\n_fuero_. No one, he said, could be cited save in his own ordinary court\r\nat the instance of an official or familiar; if it were attempted, all\r\nacts concerning it were invalid and the inquisitors must condemn the\r\nplaintiff in double the expenses and damage; if any official bought\r\nproperty in suit, or on which a suit was expected, he could be cited\r\nbefore a court not his own and if he claimed property under seizure by a\r\nsecular judge, the latter could disregard all inhibitions issued by\r\ninquisitors; moreover inquisitors should have no cognizance in matters\r\nconcerning the private property of officials. While thus striking at\r\nsome of the more flagrant abuses of the _fuero_, Leo opened the door to\r\nworse ones by admitting familiars and the commensals or servants of\r\nofficials to participation in the immunities of the Inquisition.[1058]\r\nThe bull, in fact, is in accordance with the Instructions of 1514, as\r\nissued by Inquisitor-general Mercader, and we shall see how completely\r\nthe restrictive clauses were ignored while those admitting familiars and\r\nservants were developed.[1059]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _IMMUNITY OF SERVANTS_]\r\n\r\nThe question as to familiars and servants was not absolutely settled for\r\nsome years. It is true that, in 1515 at Logroño, when the corregidor\r\narrested Martin de Viana, a servant of the secretary Lezana, and refused\r\nto surrender him to the tribunal, he and his deputy and alguazil were\r\nexcommunicated and the Suprema on appeal subjected them all to fines and\r\nhumiliating penance.[1060] On the other hand, in 1516 at Valladolid,\r\nwhen Alonso de Torres, servant of Inquisitor Frias, was thrown into the\r\nroyal prison, the inquisitor did not reclaim him but procured the\r\ninterposition of the Suprema, which ordered him to be released on bail\r\nand then, after nine months had passed without a charge being brought\r\nagainst him, he procured a royal cédula for the release of his\r\nbondsmen.[1061] Whatever doubts may have existed on the subject were\r\nremoved, in 1518, by a cédula of Charles V, reciting that in Jaen the\r\nsecular courts assumed cognizance of criminal cases concerning officials\r\nand familiars and their servants, which was contrary to the privileges\r\nof the Holy Office, wherefore he forbade it strictly for the\r\nfuture.[1062] After this the Inquisition had no hesitation in insisting\r\non its rights. When, in 1532, the corregidor and officials of Toledo\r\nwere excommunicated for punishing the servant of an inquisitor and the\r\nEmpress-regent Isabel wrote to the tribunal to absolve them, the Suprema\r\ninstructed it not to obey her.[1063] She learned the lesson and, in\r\n1535, when ordering some servants of inquisitors and familiars to be\r\nremitted to the Inquisition, she said it was accustomed to have their\r\ncases, both civil and criminal, and it was her pleasure that this should\r\nbe observed.[1064]\r\n\r\nThe civil authorities were somewhat dilatory in recognizing the immunity\r\nof servants, and cases continued to occur in which the tribunals\r\nvindicated their jurisdiction energetically. About 1565 two officers of\r\nthe royal justice in Barcelona arrested a servant of Inquisitor Mexia in\r\na brothel where he was quarrelling with a woman, for which they were\r\nthrown into the secret prison as though they were heretics and were\r\nbanished for three months, while the judge of the royal criminal court,\r\nwho had something to do with the matter, was compelled to appear in the\r\naudience-chamber and undergo a reprimand in the presence of the\r\nassembled officials of the tribunal. The virtual immunity for offenders\r\nresulting from the privilege is illustrated by the case, in the same\r\ntribunal, of Pedro Juncar, servant of the receiver, who murdered the\r\njanitor of the Governor of Catalonia; the governor arrested him but was\r\nforced to surrender him to the tribunal, which discharged him with a\r\nsentence of exile for a year or two and costs.[1065] The influence on\r\nsocial order of conferring immunity on such a class can readily be\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of the fuero was not confined to servants but was extended\r\nin whatever direction the ingenuity and perseverance of the tribunal\r\ncould enforce it. Penitents who were fulfilling their terms of penance\r\nwere claimed and the claim was confirmed, in 1547, by Prince Philip. In\r\nValencia and Barcelona the workmen employed on the buildings of the\r\nInquisition were given nominal appointments under which they claimed\r\nimmunity. In Lima the tribunal complained to the viceroy of the arrest\r\nof a bricklayer who was working for it, but it got no satisfaction. In\r\nBarcelona the tribunal granted inhibition with censures on the civil\r\ncourt, in which the brother of a familiar was suing a merchant on a\r\nprotested bill of exchange.[1066]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _IMMUNITY OF FAMILIARS_]\r\n\r\nWe have seen the limitations imposed by Ferdinand and the bull\r\n_Pastoralis officii_ and the reiteration of the principle that the\r\nplaintiff must seek justice in the court of the defendant. As far as\r\nregards Castile, Charles V had overthrown this in criminal matters for\r\nboth officials and familiars. Civil cases remained in a somewhat\r\nundetermined state, especially concerning familiars, the inquisitors\r\nendeavoring to grasp as far as they could both the active and passive\r\nfuero. When, in 1551, complaints came from Valencia that the tribunal\r\nwas collecting debts for familiars, Inquisitor-general Valdés wrote that\r\nhe did not know how this had come to pass and called for precise\r\ninformation as to when it had commenced and generally as to the method\r\nobserved in the civil cases, active and passive, of familiars, so that\r\nhe could answer Prince Philip.[1067] There was a good deal of\r\nuncertainty about the whole subject; the courts were restive and the\r\nsituation was becoming strained. In the endeavor to settle it, Charles,\r\nin 1542, reissued his edict of 1518 with a _sobre carta_ emphatically\r\ncommanding its strict observance and forbidding the secular courts from\r\nany cognizance of the criminal cases of officials or familiars.[1068]\r\nThis did not mend matters. The courts persisted in exercising\r\njurisdiction over familiars, the _recurso de fuerza_ was freely invoked\r\nand competencias multiplied. Both sides appealed to Charles, who was in\r\nGermany, and this time the opponents of the Inquisition gained the\r\nadvantage. Prince Philip, as regent, issued a cédula, May 15, 1545, in\r\nwhich he described how laymen, subject to the secular courts, obtained\r\nimmunity for their crimes on pretext of being familiars; how the\r\ntribunals, in defending them, cast excommunications on the officers of\r\njustice, through which scandals and disquiet were daily increasing, and\r\nthe course of justice was impeded. The familiars were in no way entitled\r\nto immunity from the secular courts, as they were not officials,\r\nalthough a different custom existed in Aragon and the inquisitors\r\npretended to it in Castile, under the cédula of 1518 and the sobrecédula\r\nof 1542, but these were both irregular, not having been despatched by\r\nthe Council and Secretariat of Castile as is customary and necessary.\r\nTherefore in order that delinquent familiars may not remain unpunished\r\nand be induced to commit crimes by the prospect of immunity, the emperor\r\nordered the matter to be thoroughly discussed and meanwhile the cédulas\r\nof 1518 and 1542 to be suspended, in conformity with which they are\r\ndeclared to be suspended, inquisitors are ordered no longer to take\r\ncognizance of the cases of familiars and the secular courts are\r\ninstructed to prosecute them in accordance with the laws.[1069]\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition did not acquiesce tamely in this defeat, which was\r\naggravated by the secular courts interpreting it as giving them\r\njurisdiction over officials as well as familiars. It protested and\r\nresisted and showed so little obedience that the Córtes of Valladolid,\r\nin 1548, asked that it should be compelled to confine itself to its\r\nproper functions in matters of faith.[1070] Quarrels and recursos de\r\nfuerza continued and finally the whole question was referred to a junta\r\nconsisting of two members each from the Suprema and Council of Castile.\r\nThe representatives of the Inquisition conceded that it had been in\r\nfault in appointing too many familiars and in claiming for them all the\r\nexemptions of salaried officials; those of the Council admitted that the\r\ncourts had erred in interfering with civil and criminal cases properly\r\nappertaining to the Holy Office. Mutual concessions were made, resulting\r\nin what was known as the Concordia of Castile, March 10, 1553--an\r\nagreement which the Inquisition admitted, a century later, that neither\r\nside had observed.[1071]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE LAW IN CASTILE_]\r\n\r\nThe Concordia was silent as to the salaried officials, thus leaving them\r\nin possession of the active and passive fuero in both civil and criminal\r\ncases. It devoted itself wholly to the familiars who, in this as in so\r\nmuch else, were the leading source of trouble. After regulating, as we\r\nshall see hereafter, their number and character, it defined that in\r\ncivil cases they should be subject wholly to the secular courts. For the\r\ngreater crimes, moreover, cognizance was also reserved exclusively to\r\nthe courts, the list comprising treason, unnatural crime, sedition,\r\nviolating royal safe-conducts, disobedience to royal mandates,\r\ntreachery, rape, carrying off women, highway robbery, arson,\r\nhouse-breaking and crimes of greater magnitude than these, as well as\r\nresistance or formal disrespect to the royal courts. Those who held\r\noffice were also amenable to the courts for official malfeasance. This\r\nleft only petty offences subject to inquisitorial jurisdiction and for\r\nthese familiars were liable to arrest by secular magistrates, subject to\r\nbeing immediately transferred to the Inquisition. For doubtful cases it\r\nwas provided that, when the lay judge and inquisitor could not agree,\r\nthere should be no contention, but the evidence was to be sent to the\r\ncourt of the king, where two members each of the Suprema and Council of\r\nCastile should decide as to the jurisdiction; for this a majority was\r\nrequired and, in case of equal division of votes, the matter went to the\r\nking for final decision. No appeal from this was allowed and meanwhile\r\nthe accused was retained in the prison to which he had been consigned at\r\narrest.[1072] This process of adjudicating disputes became known as\r\n_competencia_, the details of which will be considered hereafter.\r\n\r\nWhatever concession the Inquisition made in thus surrendering a portion\r\nof its jurisdiction over familiars was more than compensated by what was\r\nevidently part of the agreement, the issue on the same day of Philip's\r\ncédula addressed to all judicial bodies forbidding them to entertain\r\nappeals of any kind from the acts of the Holy Office (p. 341). It thus\r\nsecured complete autonomy; it was rendered self-judging, responsible to\r\nthe king alone, and the populations were surrendered wholly to its\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nAs far as regards Castile, the Concordia of 1553 was final. It is true\r\nthat the royal cédula of Aranjuez, April 28, 1583, extended its\r\nprinciples to the salaried officials, but there is no trace of the\r\nobservance of this.[1073] Another point was subjected to a temporary\r\nmodification. The absolute denial of justice in allowing inquisitors to\r\nhave their civil suits decided by their own tribunals attracted\r\nattention, after nearly a century, and the Suprema, February 18, 1641,\r\nordered that these cases should be referred to it, when, if it deemed\r\nproper, it would commission the tribunal to hear them, but this slender\r\nrestriction seems to have elicited so active an opposition that it was\r\nwithdrawn within three months by a counter order of May 14th, restoring\r\nto the inquisitors the power of sitting in judgement on their own\r\ncases.[1074] It is easy to conceive the amount of oppression and wrong\r\nwhich they could thus inflict.\r\n\r\nWith these trivial exceptions the Concordia remained the law in Castile.\r\nIn 1568 Philip II issued a cédula stating that it had not been observed,\r\nwherefore he ordered strict compliance with it and, as late as 1775\r\nCarlos III treats it as being still in force and to be respected by all\r\nparties.[1075] If Philip, however, expected peace between the rival and\r\njealous jurisdictions, as the result of the Concordia, he deceived\r\nhimself. Both were eager for quarrel and opportunities to gratify\r\ncombative instincts were not lacking. The secular courts resented the\r\nintrusion of the Inquisition, which was careful to keep antagonism\r\nactive by the insulting arrogance of its methods, whenever a question\r\narose between them. There was ample field for contention, for not only\r\nwere the excepted crimes loosely defined, giving rise to many nice\r\nquestions, but the Inquisition acutely argued that before the royal\r\ncourts could assume possession of a case the crime must be fully proved,\r\nfor the familiar was entitled to the fuero until his guilt was\r\nascertained, thus keeping in its own hands all the vital parts of the\r\nprocess and excluding the secular justices.[1076] Then the circle of\r\nexcepted cases was enlarged, not only for familiars but for salaried\r\nofficials, by various edicts from time to time, as we have seen with\r\nregard to pistols and discharging fire-arms. Another instance was a\r\ncédula of Philip II, in 1566, including among exceptions the violation\r\nof royal pragmáticas, which was put to the test, in 1594, when the\r\nChancellery of Granada prosecuted a notary of the tribunal for wearing a\r\nlarger ruff than was allowed by a sumptuary pragmática; the tribunal\r\nexcommunicated the judges but, when the case was carried up to the\r\nSuprema and Council of Castile, the Chancellery was justified.[1077] In\r\nthe frenzied efforts to maintain the value of the worthless vellon\r\ncoinage, Philip IV, by repeated edicts between 1631 and 1660, deprived\r\nfamiliars and salaried officials of the fuero in cases of demanding more\r\nthan the legal premium for the precious metals or of counterfeiting or\r\nimporting base money.[1078] Frauds on the revenue from tobacco also\r\ndeprived all offenders of exemptions, by a pragmática of 1719, but it\r\nwas difficult to enforce and had to be repeated in 1743, after which at\r\nlast Inquisitor-general Prado y Cuesta, in 1747, ordered the tribunals\r\nto obey it.[1079]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VALENCIA_]\r\n\r\nAlthough Navarre was under the crown of Castile, the Concordia of 1553\r\nwas not extended to it until 1665, by a royal cédula of May 9th. The\r\nquestions which agitated the rest of Spain seem to have rarely presented\r\nthemselves there, for we hear little of them in that quarter, although,\r\nin 1564, the tribunal of Logroño complained of the intrusion of the\r\nsecular courts on its jurisdiction and there were, as we shall see\r\nhereafter, occasional collisions on the subject of witchcraft, which was\r\n_mixti fori_.[1080]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe kingdoms of the Crown of Aragon were the scenes of much greater\r\ntrouble than those of Castile, in delimiting the boundaries of the rival\r\njurisdictions, for they still had institutions which could remonstrate\r\nagainst abuses and struggle for their removal. We have seen how\r\nrecalcitrant they were when the Inquisition was introduced and how\r\nvigorously they struggled against the abuses which followed. In the\r\nConcordias of 1512 and 1520 they secured certain paper guarantees, but\r\nthese were brushed aside by the Inquisition with customary ill-faith.\r\nIrritation and hostility became chronic, with the result that they were\r\ndenied some of the slender alleviations vouchsafed to Castile, on the\r\nground that the character of the population and the neighborhood of the\r\nheretics of France rendered it necessary that the Holy Office should be\r\nfortified with greater privileges than in the rest of Spain.\r\n\r\nOf the three kingdoms Valencia was the one which gave the least trouble\r\nin this matter. Yet a case occurring in 1540 is highly significant of\r\nthe terrorism under which the royal judges discharged their duties. Dr.\r\nFerrer of Tortosa, one of the judges, appealed to Inquisitor-general\r\nTavera, representing that in the previous year he had condemned to death\r\na murderer, who had fully deserved it. Now that the inquisitor had come\r\nhis enemies represent that the culprit was a familiar, although he had\r\nnever claimed to be one, and it is currently reported that the\r\ninquisitor is about to prosecute him (Ferrer). If he is in fault in the\r\nmatter he will cheerfully submit to punishment, but he begs not to be\r\nsubjected to the infamy of a trial. To this appeal the Suprema responded\r\nby ordering the inquisitor to send it such evidence as he may gather and\r\nto await a reply before taking action.[1081] It is evident that all\r\ncriminal judges lived in an atmosphere of dread lest at any moment the\r\nhonest discharge of their functions might precipitate them into a\r\ndisastrous conflict with the tribunal. It justifies the complaints of\r\nthe Córtes of 1547 and 1553, the latter of which declared that the\r\ninquisitors exceeded their jurisdiction, intervening in many affairs,\r\nboth civil and criminal, that had no connection with heresy. This caused\r\ngreat disturbance of justice and contentions between the jurisdictions,\r\nin which the tribunal assumed to be supreme and to define the limits of\r\nits own power. Great as were these evils they were daily increasing and\r\nwere becoming intolerable, wherefore the Córtes prayed that the subject\r\nbe investigated and a clear definition be made between the royal\r\njurisdiction and that of the Inquisition.[1082]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VALENCIA_]\r\n\r\nThis resulted in a junta of the members of the Suprema and of the\r\nCouncil of Aragon, who agreed upon a Concordia, published by Prince\r\nPhilip, May 11, 1554. In this he recited that, in consequence of the\r\ngreat numbers of familiars and their endeavoring to have all their\r\ncases, civil and criminal, tried by the tribunal, which sought to\r\nprotect them in this against the claims of the royal judges, there had\r\narisen many contentions in which the whole of the Audiencia had been\r\nexcommunicated. To put an end to this unseemly strife he had caused the\r\njunta to be held, with the result of the following articles, which he\r\nordered both sides to observe, the royal officials under pain of a\r\nthousand florins, and the inquisitors as they desired to please him and\r\nthe emperor. In this the first point was the reduction of the excessive\r\nnumber of familiars; in the city of Valencia they were not to exceed one\r\nhundred and eighty; in towns of more than a thousand hearths there might\r\nbe eight, in those of over five hundred six, in smaller places four,\r\nexcept that in the coast towns there might be two more. Lists of all\r\nappointees were to be furnished to the magistrates, both to check excess\r\nand to identify individuals. In civil suits they were to enjoy the\r\npassive fuero but not the active; if in contracts they renounced this\r\nprivilege the condition held good, while, if the other party agreed to\r\naccept the jurisdiction of the Inquisition, he could not be cited before\r\nit. In criminal cases, the Inquisition had sole cognizance with respect\r\nto officials, their servants and families and to familiars but not to\r\ntheir wives, children and servants. When contests arose with secular\r\ncourts, mild measures were to be used and excommunication be avoided as\r\nfar as possible. When a familiar entered into a treaty of peace and\r\ntruce, it was to be executed before an inquisitor and, if it contained a\r\ncondition of death for violation, the inquisitor, in case of such\r\nviolation, was to relax the culprit to the secular arm to be put to\r\ndeath. Familiars who were in trade were not to enjoy the fuero for\r\nfrauds or violations of municipal laws and officials holding public\r\noffice were liable to the secular courts for malfeasance therein.[1083]\r\n\r\nThis would appear to grant to the Inquisition all that it had any excuse\r\nfor asking, but it was impossible to bind the inquisitors to any\r\ncompact, or to observe any rules. A letter to them from the Suprema, in\r\nSeptember, 1560, reminds them that it had already ordered them, in the\r\ncase of Juan Sánchez, to deprive him of his familiarship, to withdraw\r\ntheir inhibitions and censures, and to remit the affair to the secular\r\njudge, in spite of which they had gone forward and rendered sentence;\r\nnow, as Sánchez is not a familiar, they must positively send the case\r\nback to the ordinary courts.[1084] When such persistence in injustice\r\nexisted, it is not surprising that, at the Córtes of Monzon, in 1564,\r\nthe deputies of Valencia, like those of Aragon and Catalonia, presented\r\na series of complaints, bearing chiefly on abuses of jurisdiction. We\r\nhappen to have a view of the situation by an impartial observer, the\r\nVenetian envoy, Giovanni Soranzo, in his relation of 1565, which is\r\nworth repeating, although we must bear in mind that it was impossible\r\nfor a Venetian statesman to give Philip II credit for the honest\r\nfanaticism which underlay his character. After alluding to the\r\nprivileges of the Aragonese kingdoms, he proceeds \"The king uses every\r\nopportunity to deprive them of these great privileges and, knowing that\r\nthere is no easier or more certain method than through the Inquisition,\r\nhe is continually increasing its authority. In these last Córtes the\r\nAragonese prayed that the Inquisition should take cognizance of no cases\r\nsave those of religion and said that they grieved greatly that it\r\nembraced infinite things as distant as possible from its jurisdiction\r\nand they presented many cases not pertaining in any way to its duties.\r\nIn truth at present the Inquisition interposes in everything, without\r\nrespect to any one of whatever rank or position, and we may say\r\npositively that this tribunal is the real master which rules and\r\ndominates all Spain. The king replied that the Inquisition was not to\r\nbe discussed in the Córtes, when they all arose and threatened to depart\r\nwithout finishing any other business, if the king did not wish them to\r\ndiscuss a matter of so much importance to them. The king quieted them by\r\npromising that, when he returned to Castile, he would listen to their\r\ncomplaints and would not fail to grant the appropriate relief. But\r\nundoubtedly he did this so that the Córtes should end without a revolt,\r\nhis intention being to increase rather than to diminish the importance\r\nof the Inquisition, clearly recognizing it as the means of maintaining\r\nhis reputation and of keeping the people in obedience and terror.\"[1085]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VALENCIA_]\r\n\r\nSoranzo's account of the Córtes is not wholly complete. When Philip\r\npromised relief after his return to Castile, the deputies replied that\r\nthey did not choose to be convoked in Castile and that they would go no\r\nfurther with the subsidio which he wanted until they were satisfied. The\r\nsessions were prolonged; the patience of the deputies outwore his own\r\nand he promised that he would have a visitation made of the tribunals of\r\nthe three kingdoms and then, in concert with their Diputados, issue a\r\nnew series of regulations.[1086] The promise was kept. Francisco de Soto\r\nSalazar, a member of the Suprema, was sent, in 1566, with full powers\r\nand instructions to investigate all abuses, but especially those\r\nconnected with jurisdiction in matters not of faith. In Valencia his\r\nattention was particularly called to a practice of appointing deputy\r\ninquisitors and officials and investing them with the privilege of the\r\nfuero as well as mechanics employed on the palace of the Inquisition and\r\nhouses of the officials and also to the overgrown number of familiars\r\nand their character.[1087] In Catalonia, especially, he found much to\r\ncriticize, as we shall have occasion to see hereafter, for he performed\r\nhis mission thoroughly and conscientiously; he listened to all\r\ncomplaints, investigated them and bore back to the Suprema full reports\r\nwhich bore hardly on the methods of all the tribunals. Prolonged debates\r\nensued between the Suprema, the Council of Aragon and the Diputados and\r\nfinally, in 1568, a new Concordia was issued. It is significant that it\r\nno longer was a royal decree but bore the shape of instructions from\r\nInquisitor-general Espinosa and the Suprema to the tribunals, and the\r\nking only appeared in it as communicating it to his representatives and\r\nordering its observance under pain of a thousand florins, coupled with\r\ncommands to favor and reverence the Inquisition and its officials, to\r\ngive them all necessary aid and to protect and defend their privileges.\r\n\r\nThe Concordia thus granted to Valencia confirmed that of 1554 and\r\nordered its observance, adding a number of special provisions, highly\r\nsuggestive of the abuses which had flourished. As affording a view in\r\nsome detail of the causes of popular irritation and of the remedies\r\nsought, I subjoin an abstract of the articles bearing on the subject.\r\n\r\n     Outside of the city the local magistrates are to have cognizance of\r\n     civil cases of familiars involving less than twelve libras.\r\n\r\n     Familiars of other districts settling in Valencia lose the fuero,\r\n     but retain it if the residence is temporary.\r\n\r\n     The number of familiars is to be reduced to that provided in 1554,\r\n     weeding out the least desirable.\r\n\r\n     They must present themselves with their commissions to the local\r\n     magistrates in order to be entered on the lists, without which they\r\n     forfeit their exemption.\r\n\r\n     The provision depriving those in trade of the fuero, for frauds and\r\n     offences committed in their business, which has not been observed,\r\n     is to be enforced.\r\n\r\n     Crimes committed prior to appointment are not entitled to the\r\n     fuero.\r\n\r\n     No cleric or religious or powerful noble or baron is to be\r\n     appointed.\r\n\r\n     Consultors are not to be considered as officials, but only persons\r\n     holding commissions from the inquisitor-general, to whom may be\r\n     added a steward of the prison and two advocates of prisoners.\r\n\r\n     In future the servants of officials must really be servants living\r\n     with them and receiving regular wages in order to be protected by\r\n     the inquisitors.\r\n\r\n     Inquisitors are not to interfere, at the petition of an official or\r\n     familiar, with the regulations of the college of surgeons.\r\n\r\n     Any familiar who is a carpenter and who brings lumber from the\r\n     sierra of Cuenca shall not be protected by the inquisitors, but\r\n     shall be left for judgement to the secular court.\r\n\r\n     Outside of cases of heresy inquisitors must not interfere with the\r\n     execution of justice by the royal judges under pretext that\r\n     culprits have committed offences pertaining to them, but in such\r\n     cases the judges shall be notified and allowed to execute justice,\r\n     after which the inquisitors can inflict punishment. In case of\r\n     heresy, however, a prisoner can be demanded, to be returned after\r\n     trial, provided he is not sentenced to relaxation.\r\n\r\n     Familiars are not to be protected in the violation of municipal\r\n     regulations, nor, during pestilence, in the refusal to observe the\r\n     regulations for the avoidance of contagion; they must submit for\r\n     inspection the goods which they bring in and the royal judges\r\n     shall not be prevented from imposing the penalties provided in the\r\n     royal pragmática.\r\n\r\n     Commissioners shall not form competencias with secular or\r\n     ecclesiastical judges, nor shall their assistants enjoy greater\r\n     privileges than familiars.\r\n\r\n     Persons temporarily employed to make arrests, or to read the\r\n     edicts, or as procurators, etc., shall not be defended by the\r\n     inquisitors.\r\n\r\n     As the inquisitorial district of Valencia comprehends Teruel in\r\n     Aragon and Tortosa in Catalonia, those places are not to be\r\n     exempted from the Concordia under the pretext that the Concordia of\r\n     1554 spoke of the kingdom of Valencia.\r\n\r\n     The widows of officials, while remaining unmarried, enjoy both\r\n     civil and criminal fuero, but not their children and families as\r\n     has been the case, but widows of familiars are deprived of it and\r\n     are not to be defended by the inquisitors.\r\n\r\n     The judge employed by the inquisitors to hear the cases of\r\n     officials and familiars is to be dismissed; such cases are to be\r\n     heard by the inquisitors outside of the regular hours of service\r\n     and for this they are to charge no fees.\r\n\r\n     Servants and families of salaried officials are only to have the\r\n     passive fuero in civil cases, like familiars.\r\n\r\n     Inquisitors are no longer to defend familiars in matters of the\r\n     apportionment of irrigating waters, injuries to harvests,\r\n     vineyards, pastures, forests, furnishing of lights, licences for\r\n     building, street-cleaning, road-mending and furnishing provisions.\r\n\r\n     Inquisitors are not to publish edicts with excommunication for the\r\n     discovery of debts, thefts or other hidden offences committed\r\n     against officials and familiars, nor such edicts against any\r\n     delinquents save in cases of heresy.\r\n\r\n     Persons arrested, except for heresy, are not to be confined in the\r\n     secret prison but in the public one, where they can confer with\r\n     their counsel and procurators, and they are to be allowed to hear\r\n     mass and receive the sacraments.\r\n\r\n     Familiars holding office are not to be defended for official frauds\r\n     or malfeasance, but the secular authorities are to be freely\r\n     allowed to administer justice.\r\n\r\n     Inquisitors shall not give safe-conducts to persons outlawed or\r\n     banished by the royal judges, except in cases of faith and then\r\n     only for the time necessary to appear before them.\r\n\r\n     When any official or familiar, in criminal or civil cases not of\r\n     faith, has consented tacitly or explicitly to the secular\r\n     jurisdiction or has pleaded clergy, the inquisitors shall not\r\n     protect him nor inhibit the secular judges. And if any official or\r\n     familiar inherits property in litigation the case shall remain in\r\n     the court where it is pending.\r\n\r\n     As familiars in civil cases have only the passive and not the\r\n     active fuero there shall no longer, as heretofore, be artifices\r\n     employed, such as pretended criminal prosecutions and interdicts,\r\n     to obtain cognizance of such cases, but they shall be conducted in\r\n     the court of the defendant.\r\n\r\n     When a suit between outsiders has been decided, if any official or\r\n     familiar intervenes to prevent the execution of the decision, on\r\n     the pretext that he is in possession of the property at issue or a\r\n     part of it, the inquisitors shall not support him in it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VALENCIA_]\r\n\r\n     If an outsider commits a crime while in company with an official or\r\n     familiar, or is an accomplice in a crime committed by an official\r\n     or familiar, the inquisitors shall not have cognizance of his case\r\n     but only of that of the official or familiar.\r\n\r\n     When a grave crime has been committed by or against a familiar the\r\n     inquisitors shall not send a judge to take testimony or punish,\r\n     with salary by the day, but shall avoid expense by making a\r\n     commissioner gather the evidence.\r\n\r\n     Inquisitors shall no longer enforce contracts of peace and truce\r\n     unless they have been entered into before them or by their order.\r\n\r\n     Inquisitors shall not have cognizance of contracts between\r\n     outsiders because of a clause submitting them to the fuero, nor of\r\n     cases of donations or cession to officials or familiars.\r\n\r\n     Inquisitors shall not protect widows of officials and familiars in\r\n     refusing to pay imposts and contributions.\r\n\r\n     When inquisitors have to summon secular judges before them it must\r\n     be only in cases where it is unavoidable and then only with great\r\n     consideration.\r\n\r\n     If a bankrupt is a familiar the inquisitors have cognizance, but\r\n     not in the case of an outsider under pretext that an official or\r\n     familiar is a creditor.\r\n\r\n     Familiars shall not make arrests or other execution of justice\r\n     without orders from inquisitors.\r\n\r\n     Inquisitors shall not proceed against the priors and officials of\r\n     guilds and confraternities who levy upon a familiar, who is a\r\n     member, for dues under the rules of the association, or when a\r\n     familiar has had the administration of a church or hermitage or\r\n     hospital and is sued for debts or contributions due.[1088]\r\n\r\nThe other prayers and demands of the Córtes were rejected, but those\r\nwhich were granted sufficiently indicate the abusive manner in which the\r\ntribunal had extended its jurisdiction, how that jurisdiction was\r\nadmittedly used to protect officials and familiars in violations of law,\r\nand how intolerable was the influence on municipal and commercial life\r\nof letting loose on the community a class who were beyond the reach of\r\njustice. We can readily understand the eagerness of the lawless and\r\nunscrupulous to obtain positions which secured for them such privileges\r\nand why it was impossible to restrain inquisitors within the prescribed\r\nlimits of their appointing power.\r\n\r\nAfter protracted effort the Valencians had thus obtained promise of\r\nsubstantial relief, but as usual it was a promise only made to be\r\nbroken. How little intention there was of enforcing the reform was\r\npromptly revealed for, when the authorities naturally ordered the new\r\nConcordia to be printed so that the courts and rural magistrates could\r\nbe guided by it in their dealings with the officials and familiars, the\r\ninquisitors at once ordered the printers to suspend work and appealed\r\nto the king, who commanded that all copies should be surrendered.[1089]\r\nAlthough the settlement was permanent and remained in force until the\r\nend, it apparently never was published for general information. At the\r\nmoment it was regarded as greatly limiting the secular jurisdiction of\r\nthe tribunal, and the worthy Valencian inquisitor, Juan de Rojas, says\r\nthat he is ashamed to allude to its depressed and weakened condition,\r\nwhich has worked great injury to the faith.[1090] His grief was\r\nsuperfluous; the tribunal was not accustomed to be bound by law and its\r\nmethods of enforcing its assumed prerogatives were difficult to resist.\r\nIn 1585 the Córtes had a fresh accumulation of grievances which, by\r\norder of the king, the Suprema sent to the inquisitors with orders to\r\nreport the method of meeting them most advantageous to the Holy\r\nOffice.[1091]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VALENCIA_]\r\n\r\nIf space permitted abundant cases could be cited to show the justice of\r\nthese complaints. In fact, the correspondence between the Suprema and\r\nthe tribunal, during the last fifteen years of the sixteenth century, is\r\nlargely devoted to cases of competencias arising from crimes of all\r\ndescriptions committed by familiars and to the punishments inflicted by\r\nthe tribunal, the heaviest of which is the galleys, in two or three\r\ncases. Sometimes the charges are dismissed and as a whole the criminals\r\nseem to have escaped so lightly that prosecution only served to\r\nencourage their lawlessness.[1092] There was no improvement as time went\r\non and a case occurring in 1632 is worth alluding to as illustrating the\r\nresults of the _fuero_ and the spirit in which it was administered by\r\nthe tribunal. Don Martin Santis was murdered by pistol shots, while\r\nreturning with some Dominican frailes in a coach from the Grao of\r\nValencia to the city. Four notorious familiars, Pedro Rebert, Joan\r\nCiurana, Jaime Blau and Calixto Tafalla, were suspected and were\r\narrested by the Audiencia. The tribunal claimed them, a competencia was\r\nformed and the case came up before the Suprema and the Council of\r\nAragon. The Marquis of los Velez, the viceroy, took advantage of it to\r\nrepresent to Philip IV the disorders and scandals caused by the criminal\r\nfamiliars who were protected by the Inquisition. This paper was referred\r\nto the Council of Aragon which, on July 21st, presented a consulta on\r\nthe subject. There is, it says, no peace or safety to be hoped for in\r\nValencia unless there is reform in the selection of familiars, for there\r\nis no crime committed there in which they are not principals or\r\naccomplices, in the confidence of escape through the intervention of the\r\ntribunal, since there is no one, however guilty he may be of atrocious\r\ncrime, who is not speedily seen walking the streets in freedom. In all\r\ndisturbances, familiars are recognized as ringleaders and their object\r\nin gaining appointment is only to enjoy immunity for their crimes. In\r\nValencia, Pedro Revert, Joan Ciurana and Sebastian Adell, all familiars,\r\nare the chief disturbers of the peace. So in Villareal, a place\r\nnotorious for murders, Jaime Blau has been the moving spirit. In\r\nBenignamin, where there are constant outbreaks, the leaders of the\r\nfactions are Gracian España, Martin Barcela and others, likewise\r\nfamiliars. It is the same in Orihuela with Juan García de Espejo and\r\nothers. Scarce anywhere is there trouble in which familiars are not\r\nconcerned and they daily become more insolent through impunity, for the\r\ninquisitors never punish with the requisite severity. One result is that\r\nit is almost impossible to procure evidence against these malefactors,\r\nin consequence of witnesses knowing that they will shortly be released\r\nand will avenge themselves. Justice cannot be administered and still\r\ngreater evils are to be anticipated if the king does not provide a\r\nremedy. If it is difficult to revise the Concordia and introduce the\r\nnecessary provisions, at least the king can order that these familiars\r\nbe dismissed and greater care be exercised in new appointments. All the\r\nviceroys have recognized these impediments to justice, for these people\r\nonly seek exemption from the secular courts in order to be free to\r\ncommit crimes.\r\n\r\nWe might imagine much of this to be exaggeration were not its truth\r\ntacitly admitted by the Suprema, when transmitting it to Valencia with\r\ninstructions for information on which to base a reply. There is no\r\nrebuke or exhortation to amendment, but the inquisitors are told to act\r\nwith the utmost caution and secrecy; to report the number of familiars\r\nin Valencia and how many are unmarried; to give details as to the cases\r\ncited by the Council of Aragon and what punishments were inflicted; what\r\nwas the record of those inculpated in the murder of Don Martin Santís;\r\ncovertly to obtain statistics of crime in Valencia for the last ten\r\nyears, committed by those not exempt, the punishments inflicted by the\r\nroyal court and whether these were subsequently remitted; whether, when\r\nfamiliars were tried by the tribunal, accomplices were prosecuted in\r\nthe royal courts, and if so what sentences were pronounced; also to make\r\nsecret investigation as to promises made to familiars by the judges to\r\nlet them off easily if they would not claim the fuero, and finally to\r\nfurnish a list of cases in which the tribunal has punished its officials\r\nfor trifling offences. Altogether the effort was evidently much less to\r\noffer a justification than to make a _tu quoque_ rejoinder. Apparently\r\nthe statistics asked of the tribunal were unsatisfactory, for there was\r\nno use made of them in the answer presented October 6th, in which, after\r\nseeking to explain away the assertions of the viceroy and Council of\r\nAragon, the Suprema accused the secular courts and their officials of\r\nperpetual prosecution of familiars, who were arrested on the slightest\r\nsuspicion, assumed to be guilty and then forced by cruel treatment to\r\nrenounce the fuero. The suggestions for reform were airily brushed\r\naside. To dismiss delinquent familiars would be almost impossible, in\r\nview of its effect upon their families and kindred. To enquire of the\r\nroyal officials as to the character of aspirants for appointment was\r\ninadmissible, as it would admit them to participation in a matter with\r\nwhich they had nothing to do. The true cure for the troubles would be to\r\nsecure the Inquisition in its rights by forbidding the secular courts\r\nfrom assuming any jurisdiction over familiars. In short it was a\r\npassionate outburst, precluding all hope of amendment, to which the king\r\nreplied by telling the Suprema to see that the tribunal did not employ\r\nviolent measures against the royal officials, but report to him any\r\nexcess for his action. Evidently nothing was to be hoped for from him\r\nand indeed he had written on August 6th to the viceroy that the case\r\nmust take its regular course as a competencia and the inquisitors must\r\nnot use inhibitory censures or summon the judges to appear before them.\r\nThe result was the usual one that the tribunal obtained cognizance of\r\nthe case; one, at least, of the accused, Jaime Blau, was found guilty,\r\nfor we have his insufficient sentence, condemning him to exile and a\r\nfine of three hundred ducats--a sentence which goes far to explain the\r\neagerness of the inquisitors to extend their jurisdiction, for they\r\nrarely inflicted corporal punishments on their delinquent officials,\r\nwhen pecuniary ones were so much more profitable.[1093]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VALENCIA_]\r\n\r\nThe same spirit was shown when, in 1649, disturbances between armed\r\nbands led Philip IV to order the Suprema to instruct the inquisitors\r\nthat familiars and officials participating in these brawls, or lending\r\naid to peacebreakers, should not enjoy the fuero and that the tribunal\r\nshould not defend them or interfere with the course of justice. Instead\r\nof obeying, the Suprema replied that it suspended the order until the\r\nking should be better informed. It then proceeded with a long argument\r\nto show that the faith would be imperilled by such abridgement of the\r\nprivileges of the Holy Office. Besides, these factional contests had\r\nalways been customary in Valencia and it was impossible to avoid\r\nfavoring one side or the other, for these armed bands demanded whatever\r\nthey wanted--money, or food or clothes--and people were forced to give\r\nit at the risk of having their harvests burnt or their throats cut. The\r\nconsulta ended with the impudent suggestion that in future it would be\r\nmuch better for the king, before issuing such decrees, to communicate to\r\nthe Suprema the consultas of the other councils on which they were based\r\nso that a junta could be formed and the matter be debated.[1094]\r\n\r\nEvidently the Suprema held that this semi-savage state of society should\r\nbe encouraged by favoring the factionists and, under such conditions,\r\namelioration was impossible. Rivalry of jurisdiction paralyzed the law\r\nand there was perpetual friction over the veriest trifles, for the\r\ntribunal was always on the watch to resist the minutest infraction of\r\nits prerogatives or disregard of its dignity. When, in 1702, Jacinto\r\nNadal, a familiar of Onteniente, received a summons to appear before Don\r\nPedro Domenech, a criminal judge of the Audiencia, he at once appealed\r\nto the tribunal which sent word, on May 29th, that he had been under\r\narrest since March 25th and the papers in any charge against him must be\r\nsurrendered to it. It turned out that Domenech only wanted him to enter\r\nsecurity for his son and, when this was done, the inquisitors complained\r\nthat Nadal had done wrong in going to the judge after appealing to them,\r\nand that Domenech had not treated them with proper respect, so that some\r\nmonths were required to arrange a truce between them.[1095]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAragon was a source of greater trouble than Valencia. The popular spirit\r\nwas more independent, it had resisted the introduction of the\r\nInquisition until the murder of San Pedro Arbués had rendered further\r\nopposition impossible, it had been cheated of the fruits of the tenacity\r\nof Juan Prat and it possessed an institution peculiar to itself,\r\ndesigned to limit the encroachments of the sovereign power and well\r\nadapted to restrain the arrogance of anything less formidable than the\r\nmingled spiritual and temporal jurisdiction of the Holy Office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ARAGON_]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the court of the Justicia of Aragon was fondly attributed\r\nby the Aragonese to the legendary times of the kingdom of Sobrarve and\r\nthere is fair probability in the theory of the latest writer on the\r\nsubject that it was derived by the Christians from the conquered\r\nMoors.[1096] In the thirteenth century the Justicia was already judge\r\nbetween the king and his subjects; every precaution was taken to render\r\nhim independent; he was irremovable by the king and even his resignation\r\nwas void; he could accept no office from the king; he was not liable to\r\narrest and in a case of prosecution the Córtes sat in judgement on him;\r\nevery person in the kingdom was required to obey his commands, to\r\nrespect his decisions and to aid in their enforcement. His court\r\nconsisted of his assessors or lieutenants, originally appointed by him,\r\nbut subsequently by the king. The Córtes of 1528 increased the number to\r\nfive, submitting fifteen names to Charles V, who selected five, while\r\nthe rest were placed in a _bolsa_ and drawn as vacancies occurred. They\r\nwere virtually the equals of the Justicia, for the assent of a majority\r\nwas required in all judgements and all precautions were taken to secure\r\ntheir independence.[1097] It is true that, in spite of the inviolability\r\nof the Justicia, there were cases on record in which Justicias had been\r\nmade way with and that, on the suppression of the rising caused by\r\nAntonio Pérez, in 1591, the Justicia, Juan de Lanuza, was beheaded\r\nwithout trial, and in the ensuing Córtes of Tarazona the appointment of\r\nboth Justicia and lieutenants was surrendered to the king.[1098]\r\nNevertheless the court of the Justicia was regarded by the Aragonese\r\nwith the greatest pride and reverence, as the safeguard of their\r\nliberties and the highest expression of judicial authority existing in\r\nthe world; it was the bond that united the state and the foundation of\r\nits tranquillity. When the Justicia authorized the cry of _Contrafuero!\r\nViva la Libertad y ayuda á la Libertad!_ it summoned every citizen to\r\nsally forth in arms to defend the liberties of the land. Moreover, he\r\nhad the power of withholding from execution all papal decrees, and his\r\nauthority in ecclesiastical matters in general caused him to be\r\npopularly termed the married pope.[1099]\r\n\r\nSo far as we are concerned, the power of the court was exercised through\r\ntwo processes, the _manifestacion_ and the _firma_. The former was a\r\nkind of habeas corpus, under which a person had to be produced before\r\nit, either to be liberated on bail or to be confined in the _carcel de\r\nmanifestados_--a special prison over which even the king had no\r\njurisdiction. The summons of a manifestacion had to be obeyed, even if\r\nthe subject were on the gallows with the halter around his neck, or if\r\nit was addressed to the highest secular or spiritual court of the land.\r\nIt was a privilege to which every citizen was entitled; when, in 1532,\r\nCharles V sent orders that Don Pedro de Luna should be deprived of it,\r\nhe was not obeyed, and a special envoy was sent to him in Germany,\r\nasking the prompt withdrawal of the command as, until the return of the\r\nmessenger, the land would be in great suspense. The _firma_ was of\r\nvarious kinds, but in general it was of the nature of an injunction,\r\nstopping all proceedings and summoning the parties before the court of\r\nthe Justicia, where their cases would be determined, and it was\r\nespecially useful in preventing arbitrary arrests and seizure of\r\nproperty. Failure to obey a firma was promptly followed by seizure of\r\ntemporalities and, under a fuero of King Martin, it could be served on\r\nthe king himself. One was served on Charles V, at Valladolid, and again\r\none on the papal nuncio and, when the latter disregarded it, his\r\ntemporalities were sequestrated. Such a jurisdiction could not fail to\r\ncome into collision with the Inquisition, against which its powers were\r\nfrequently invoked, and the favorite device of the tribunal, of evading\r\nservice by closing its doors, was unavailing, for attaching the firma to\r\nthe gates was held to be legal service. In 1561, the Justicia granted a\r\nmanifestacion to Don Juan Francés del Ariño, in a case not of faith; the\r\ntribunal prepared to answer by fulminating excommunications, but the\r\ncourt issued a _monitorio_ against it, when a settlement was reached\r\nwhich both parties considered satisfactory. In the same year, when the\r\ninquisitors arrested Bartolomé Garate, secretary of the court, it served\r\na monitorio upon them and, in 1563, it did the same for the censures\r\nissued against Augustin de Morlanes, of the criminal council of the\r\nAudiencia. In 1626, when Pedro Banet, secretary of the tribunal, was\r\naccused of the murder of Juan Domingo Serveto, the action of the\r\ninquisitors led to the issue against them of a firma and monitorio,\r\nunder which their temporalities were seized and this was followed by\r\nanother firma, prohibiting the use of excommunication.[1100]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ARAGON_]\r\n\r\nUnder such institutions, animated by such a spirit, it was inevitable\r\nthat the extension of the temporal jurisdiction of the Holy Office\r\nshould provoke a bitter and prolonged conflict. We have seen the early\r\nstruggles of this; how concessions were wrung from monarch and\r\nInquisition, to be disregarded by them as soon as the momentary pressure\r\nhad passed, and how the remonstrances of the Córtes of 1528 and 1533\r\nwere contemptuously brushed aside. The grievances were real and the\r\nSuprema knew them to be such, but the policy was invariable of denying\r\ntheir existence and refusing amendment when asked for by the sufferers.\r\nThe temper in which complaints were heard was significantly manifested\r\nwhen, in 1533, the Córtes of Monzon adopted certain articles and\r\npresented them to Inquisitor-general Manrique and the Suprema, with the\r\nrequest that they should be adopted. Thereupon Miguel de Galbe, fiscal\r\nof the tribunal of Lérida, addressed to Manrique a formal accusation,\r\nnaming four members of the Córtes, who seem to have been the committee\r\ndeputed to communicate with the Suprema, asking that they and all who\r\nhad advocated the articles should be prosecuted as fautors of heretics\r\nand impeders and disturbers of the Inquisition, while the articles in\r\nquestion should be publicly torn and burnt as condemned and suspect of\r\nheresy, injurious to the honor of God and prejudicial to the Holy\r\nOffice.[1101] Parliamentary discussion had doubtless been warm and\r\nfreedom of debate and legislation was contrary to the principles of the\r\nHoly Office. Possibly it was the unpleasant experience of the Suprema on\r\nthis occasion that led it to keep away from the Córtes of Monzon in\r\n1537 and to order the inquisitors to do likewise or, if their duties\r\ncalled them there, to keep silent. Thus, when the Córtes asked the\r\nemperor to make the Inquisition obey the laws, he was able to promise\r\naccordingly and then the Suprema could subsequently argue it away in a\r\nconsulta.[1102]\r\n\r\nThe remedial decree of Prince Philip, in 1545, was limited to Castile,\r\nand Aragon was coolly told that its customs were different. Abuses\r\ncontinued unchecked and at the Córtes of Monzon, in 1547, a long series\r\nof grievances was presented to the inquisitor-general, as though the\r\ncrown had ceased to be a factor. The bull _Pastoralis officii_, by which\r\nLeo X had confirmed the Concordia of 1512, had limited the number of\r\nfamiliars to ten permanent ones in Saragossa and ten temporary ones\r\nelsewhere as needed, in place of which the number was between five\r\nhundred and a thousand; the bull had prescribed that they should be\r\nmarried men of good character, in place of which many were bandits and\r\nhomicides and of notoriously evil life; the bull had ordered dismissal\r\nfor officials and familiars who did not pay their debts or who engaged\r\nin trade, whereas the fuero was held to cover debts contracted and\r\noffences committed prior to appointment; when they became bankrupt they\r\ntook refuge with the tribunal and the creditors were unpaid; if they\r\nwere creditors of a bankrupt they seized all the assets and others got\r\nnothing; men procured appointments in order to revenge themselves in\r\nsafety on their enemies; it was impossible to collect debts of them and\r\nthis protection was extended even to women. A woman who claimed that her\r\nfather had been a familiar was thus defended from her creditors; the\r\nbrother of a notary of the tribunal, who had committed an offence,\r\ncaused the aggrieved parties to be arrested and the inquisitors held\r\nthem until they were forced to a compromise. How little hope there was\r\nof redress for all this is visible in the contemptuous indifference with\r\nwhich Inquisitor-general Valdés answered the several articles. As to\r\nbandits and homicides being made familiars, he said the Inquisition had\r\nneed of all kinds of officials for its various functions, and as to the\r\nspecific complaints the stereotyped answer was that any one deeming\r\nhimself aggrieved could appeal to the Suprema and get justice.[1103]\r\n\r\nThe Concordia of 1553 was applicable to Castile alone and that of 1554\r\nto Valencia. Aragon remained without the slender alleviation provided\r\nfor in the latter, for the adjustments of 1512 and 1521 were treated as\r\nnon-existent. At the Córtes of 1563-4 the complaints were so vivacious\r\nthat, as we have seen, Philip promised investigation which resulted in\r\nthe Concordia of 1568. The formula for Aragon was virtually the same as\r\nthe combined Valencia Concordias of 1554 and 1568, the evils with which\r\nthe two kingdoms were afflicted being virtually the same. As usual,\r\nfamiliars were the class that excited the bitterest hostility. Their\r\ncommissions were all to be called in and then sixty were to be appointed\r\nfor Saragossa, while the other towns were assigned from eight to one or\r\ntwo according to population. Their character was to be closely\r\nscrutinized and all bandits, homicides, criminals, powerful nobles,\r\nfrailes and clerics were to be excluded, and no one was to enjoy the\r\nfuero whose name was not on lists presented to the magistrates. They\r\nwere to have, in criminal matters, the active and passive fuero but in\r\ncivil suits only the passive; it was the same with servants of\r\nofficials, while officials themselves had active and passive in both\r\ncivil and criminal. The utmost caution and moderation was prescribed in\r\nthe employment of inhibitions and excommunications of the royal judges,\r\nand the royal alguazils were not to be arrested save in cases of grave\r\nand notorious infraction of inquisitorial rights.[1104]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ARAGON_]\r\n\r\nThe Concordia did not bring concord. In 1571 there arose a bitter\r\ndispute between the tribunal and the court of the Justicia, in which\r\nexcommunications were freely used and, in December, the Diputados\r\nappealed to Pius V to evoke the case and remove the censures, but he\r\ntold them to go to the inquisitor-general. After the death of Pius, the\r\nkingdom insisted with Gregory XIII and, in December, 1572, obtained from\r\nhim a brief committing the case to the Suprema or to Ponce de Leon the\r\nnew inquisitor-general, but, at the same time, he ordered that some\r\nremedy be found to prevent the inquisitors from abusing the privileges\r\nconceded to them by the canons and the popes.[1105] The next year, 1573,\r\nformal complaints were made by the kingdom of infractions of the\r\nConcordia and, by 1585, aggravation had reached a point that the Córtes\r\nasked for a new concordia. Philip promised to send a person to Saragossa\r\nto gather information as to grievances alleged against certain\r\ninquisitors and officials, after which arrangements were made for the\r\ndrafting and acceptance or rejection of a new agreement, but there is no\r\ntrace of any resultant understanding.[1106] Quarrelling necessarily\r\ncontinued with little intermission. In 1613 the removal of the name of\r\nJuan Porquet, a familiar, from _insaculacion_, by the royal commissioner\r\nof Tamarit, gave rise to a great disturbance which was long remembered\r\nand, in 1619, there was a clash between the tribunal and the\r\ncaptain-general, which caused much scandal, resulting in the governor\r\nbeing summoned to Madrid, where he was kept for four years.[1107]\r\n\r\nThus it went on until, in 1626, the Córtes were again assembled. It was\r\nknown that demands for relief would be made and the Suprema asked Philip\r\nto submit to it whatever articles were proposed, in reply to which he\r\nassured it that there should be no change to its prejudice, but that he\r\nwould procure its increase of privilege.[1108] The chief business of the\r\nCórtes was the questions connected with the Inquisition. Philip was not\r\npresent and his representative, the Count of Monterrey, did not feel\r\nempowered to grant the demands made. The only absolute action taken was\r\nto adopt as a _fuero_ or law the Concordia of 1568, which hitherto had\r\nonly the authority of the orders of the king and inquisitor-general. As\r\nregards reform, it was left to a commission, consisting on one side of\r\nroyal appointees and on the other of four delegates named by each of the\r\nfour _brazos_ or estates. The commission framed a series of fourteen\r\narticles, by no means radical in their character, but Philip\r\nprocrastinated in confirming or rejecting them; the Suprema, in 1627,\r\nappealed to Rome to withhold papal sanction and they were quietly\r\nallowed to drop, on the pretext that the Concordia of 1568, now erected\r\ninto law, would suffice to prevent future grounds of complaint. How\r\nfutile this was is apparent from a conflict which occurred during the\r\nsitting of the commission. The assessor of the governor, as was his\r\nduty, entered the house of the secretary of the tribunal, _flagrante\r\ndelicto_, for a most treacherous murder attributed to him. Although his\r\nobligation to do this was notorious, arrest of subordinates followed on\r\nboth sides and the indignant people were with difficulty restrained\r\nfrom a tumult. The royal officials at once took steps to form a\r\ncompetencia, in conformity with the Concordia which had just been\r\nerected into a law; this required all proceedings to be suspended but\r\nthe inquisitors excommunicated the assessor, refusing to join in the\r\ncompetencia because, as they asserted, the case was an evident one, thus\r\nassuming that they could set aside all law by merely declaring that a\r\ncase was evident.[1109]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ARAGON_]\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition had never been restrained by the Concordia and now that\r\nit had again baffled the Córtes it was still less inclined to submit to\r\nrestraint. Quarrels continued as virulent as before, a single example of\r\nwhich will illustrate its invincible tendency to extend its jurisdiction\r\non all possible pretexts. Berenguer de San Vicente of Huesca, in 1534,\r\nhad founded in that city the College of Santiago and when, in 1538, the\r\nmunicipality added an endowment of more than six thousand ducats, he\r\nmade the magistrates its patrons. In 1542 he procured from Charles V a\r\ncédula, confirmed by the pope, making the inquisitors of Aragon visitors\r\nor inspectors of the college, during the royal pleasure and so long as\r\nthey should perform their functions loyally and well. This supervisory\r\nfunction they stretched in course of time to bring the college and all\r\nits members under their jurisdiction, although in 1643 it was asserted\r\nthat the last visitation had been made in 1624. This power they\r\nexercised in most arbitrary fashion. When an attempt was made to burn\r\nthe college and the town offered a reward for the detection of the\r\nincendiary, they interposed with the threat of an interdict and\r\nfrightened the citizens into submission. In 1643 a pasquinade against\r\nsome of the inhabitants led to the prosecution of the rector of the\r\ncollege, Dr. Juan Lorenzo Salas, who promptly procured letters from the\r\ntribunal inhibiting further proceedings and demanding all the papers.\r\nThe patience of Huesca was exhausted. It declared its position to be\r\nintolerable, for the students appealed to the fuero in all disputes with\r\nthe townsmen, and the result of the stimulus thus given to that\r\nturbulent element was driving away the population and every one lived in\r\napprehension of some terrible event. To gain relief it applied to the\r\nAudiencia for a competencia but was told that this was impossible,\r\nwhereupon it obtained from the court of the Justicia a _firma_\r\nprohibiting the inquisitors from acting; they refused to allow it to be\r\nserved when it was put on the gate of the Aljaferia with notice that if\r\nanswer was not made within thirty days it would be followed with exile\r\nand seizure of temporalities. The Suprema ordered the inquisitors to\r\nanswer by excommunicating all concerned. Philip was then in Saragossa,\r\non his way to Catalonia to put himself at the head of his army, for the\r\ndisgrace of Olivares had forced him to govern as well as to reign, but\r\nhe was compelled to distract his thoughts with these miserable\r\nsquabbles. The Council of Aragon appealed to him to require the\r\ninquisitors to show cause why they should not be deprived of the\r\nvisitation and to impose silence on all until he should reach a\r\ndecision; the Audiencia rendered an opinion that the court of the\r\nJusticia could not refuse to issue the firma and, if the complainant\r\ninsisted on its service, it must be served if the whole power of the\r\nkingdom had to be called upon. On the other hand the Suprema declared\r\nthat the service of the firma was unexampled and urged the king to\r\nsupport the Inquisition in a matter on which depended the ruin or the\r\npreservation of the monarchy, for it would be better to close the Holy\r\nOffice than to expose its jurisdiction to such disgrace, while in these\r\ncalamitous times favor shown to the Inquisition would placate God and\r\ninsure the success of his arms. Philip's reply was long and maundering,\r\nirresolute between his reverence for the Inquisition and his fear of\r\nalienating in his extremity the Aragonese by violating their most\r\ncherished privileges. If Huesca would desist from the service of the\r\nfirma he would order the tribunal to form a competencia. Huesca,\r\nhowever, was intractable; its very existence, it asserted, was at stake\r\nand it begged the king not to interfere with the legal remedies to which\r\nit had been forced and, in conveying this reply to the king, the Council\r\nof Aragon warned him that it could not prevent Huesca from serving the\r\nfirma, as this would be a notorious violation of the law on the point\r\nregarded by the kingdom as most essential. Yet, after all, the question\r\nwas evaded by the device of appointing as visitor of the college the\r\ninquisitor Juan Llano de Valdés, who succeeded in reaching an agreement\r\nwith the city. It would seem that thereafter special visitors were\r\nnominated for, in 1665, we hear of such an appointment issued to\r\nInquisitor Carlos del Hoya and it may be doubted whether Huesca gained\r\nmuch.[1110]\r\n\r\nThese disturbances mark the highest point reached by the Inquisition in\r\nAragon as regards its temporal jurisdiction. How little cause of\r\ncomplaint it really had, and how Aragon, in spite of its sturdy\r\nindependence, had endured greater abuses than those permitted in\r\nCastile, is evinced in a suggestion made by the Suprema, February 11,\r\n1643, in response to a demand from the king to devise some new source of\r\nraising money for the bankrupt treasury. This was that if he would grant\r\nto the familiars of Castile the same privileges of active and passive\r\nfuero enjoyed by those of Aragon, they would cheerfully contribute to a\r\nconsiderable assessment, with the added advantage of diminishing the\r\ncompetencias which caused so much trouble and loss of time.[1111] Such a\r\nproposal affords the measure of the wrongs inflicted on society by those\r\nwho profited by their exemption from the secular courts, for even the\r\nmore limited privileges of the Castilian familiars rendered the position\r\none to be eagerly sought, in spite of the considerable cost of proving\r\nthe condition precedent of _limpieza_, or purity of blood. These evils\r\nwere vastly aggravated by the fact, as we shall see hereafter, that the\r\ntribunals never regarded the limitation on numbers prescribed by the\r\nConcordias, but filled the land with these privileged persons who, for\r\nthe most part, turned to the best account the protection of the Holy\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ARAGON_]\r\n\r\nThat Aragon should be permanently restive under this adverse\r\ndiscrimination was inevitable and the time had come when it could\r\ndictate in place of supplicating. Since the Córtes of 1626 twenty years\r\nelapsed before Philip found himself constrained to assemble them again.\r\nThe situation was desperate; the Catalan rebellion bade fair to end in\r\nthe permanent alienation of the Principality to France, and it was not\r\nwise to impose too severe a strain on the loyalty of Aragon, when the\r\nCórtes met September 20, 1645, for a session of fifteen months. In\r\npreparation for the struggle, the Suprema presented to the king,\r\nSeptember 30th, an elaborately argued memorial in which it told him that\r\nthe calamities of the war should lead him to greater zeal in fortifying\r\nthe Inquisition with new graces and privileges, so as to win the favor\r\nof God, whose cause they served and from whom alone was relief to be\r\nexpected. It was therefore asked that whatever demands on the subject\r\nshould be presented should be reserved for discussion with the\r\ninquisitor-general and Suprema.[1112] Philip doubtless made the desired\r\npromise, but the Aragonese had too often found their hopes frustrated in\r\nthis manner to submit to it again under existing circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Córtes lost no time in presenting their petition on the subject,\r\nwhich asked for radical reform in all the Aragonese kingdoms. The\r\njurisdiction of the Inquisition was to be confined to cases of faith and\r\nto civil and criminal actions between its officials. In certain mixed\r\ncases, such as bigamy, unnatural crime, sorcery, solicitation and\r\ncensorship it should have jurisdiction cumulative with the appropriate\r\nsecular and spiritual courts. A number of minor points were added,\r\nincluding a demand that all inquisitors and officials should be natives\r\nand it was significantly stated that the petition was presented thus\r\nearly in order that it might be granted, so that the Córtes could\r\nproceed more heartily with the servicio that was asked for. This paper\r\nwas submitted to the Suprema which replied in a long consulta, March 31,\r\n1646, arguing that the Inquisition had been introduced into Aragon\r\nwithout law and was independent of all law. It proceeded to demonstrate,\r\nas we have seen (p. 345), that its temporal jurisdiction was inalienable\r\nand that the Concordias were compacts which could not be modified\r\nwithout its consent. The officials were so abhorred that it would be\r\nimpossible for them to perform their duties if they were not thus\r\nprotected. If the Córtes should stubbornly insist, the king was urged,\r\nlike Charles V in 1518, to remember his soul and his conscience, and to\r\nprefer the loss of part of his dominions rather than consent to anything\r\ncontrary to the honor of God and the authority of the Inquisition.[1113]\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Suprema was to carry the war into Africa, and it\r\nfollowed this manifesto with another demanding that the court of the\r\nJusticia should be prohibited from issuing firmas and manifestaciones in\r\ncases concerning the Inquisition. Both sides asked for more than they\r\nexpected to get and, when the Córtes answered these papers, June 20th,\r\nafter numerous citations to disprove the arguments of the Suprema and an\r\nexposition of the hardships caused by the existing system, they opened\r\nthe way to a compromise by pointing out that Castile for nearly a\r\nhundred years had enjoyed what Aragon had vainly prayed for, and\r\nconcluded by suggesting that the best settlement would be to confer on\r\nAragon the Concordia of Castile which had been thoroughly discussed by\r\nlawyers and its practical working determined and understood.[1114]\r\n\r\nFinally the demands of the Córtes were formulated in a series of\r\ntwenty-seven articles, which were prudently declared to be law, whether\r\nconfirmed or not by the inquisitor-general. Of these the essential ones\r\ndeprived familiars of the active and passive fuero in civil suits, of\r\nthe active in criminal cases, and excepted certain specified crimes in\r\nthe passive. Servants of salaried officials were put on the same footing\r\nin criminal matters. The number of both familiars and salaried officials\r\nwas limited to four hundred and fifty in the whole kingdom and those who\r\nheld office were deprived of the fuero for official malfeasance; in\r\ncases not of faith the use of torture was prohibited as well as\r\nconfinement in the secret prison; all cases, whether civil or criminal,\r\nwere to be concluded within two years; fraudulent alienation of property\r\nto officials, so as to place it under the fuero, was declared invalid;\r\nall persons or bodies, in case of violation of these provisions, had the\r\nright to avail themselves of all remedies known to the laws of the land,\r\nwhile to the tribunal was reserved the power to employ censures and\r\nother legal processes. A concession was made by granting to both\r\nofficials and familiars the right of asylum in their houses, relief from\r\nbilleting, exemption from arrest for debt, capacity to hold office and\r\nfreedom from tolls, ferriages, etc. In return for this the Córtes were\r\nliberal with the servicio, agreeing to keep in the field two thousand\r\nfoot and five hundred horse for four years, paying them two reales a\r\nday, while the king should find them in food, arms and horses.[1115]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ARAGON_]\r\n\r\nIn these conditions there was nothing affecting the faith or restricting\r\nthe persecution of heresy; nothing save a prudent regard for the peace\r\nand protection of society from the intolerable burden of gangs of\r\nvirtual bandits clothed in inviolability. Yet Philip resisted to the\r\nlast extremity these reasonable concessions, which merely placed Aragon\r\non the same footing as Castile. We are told that he declared that he\r\ncherished the Inquisition as the apple of his eye and that he exhausted\r\nevery means to preserve its privileges. He offered to concede everything\r\nelse that was asked; he endeavored to win the Aragonese by bribing them\r\nwith royal grants and graces, of which three hundred and sixty were\r\npublished in a single day, with the names of the recipients, but\r\nnothing could overcome the hatred felt for the Holy Office and the\r\n_brazos_ were immovable. In his perplexity he appealed to his usual\r\ncounsellor, the mystic Sor María de Agreda, affirming his determination\r\nto uphold the Inquisition, and he must have been surprised when that\r\nclear-sighted woman advised him to compromise, for a quarrel with Aragon\r\nmight turn it to the side of Catalonia and lead to the permanent\r\ndisruption of the monarchy. Even this failed to move him. He endeavored\r\nto depart for Madrid, but deputation after deputation was sent to the\r\nconvent of Santa Engracia where he was lodged, insisting on his\r\nconfirmation of the articles and detaining him for two or three days\r\nwhile his coach stood ready at the gate, until at last he yielded,\r\nseeing that there was no alternative. The writer who records this adds\r\nthat the people rejoiced and since then in Aragon, where the Inquisition\r\nhad stood higher than elsewhere, for an inquisitor was regarded with\r\nmore reverence than an archbishop or a viceroy, it has so fallen in\r\nestimation that some say that all is over with it. The officials and\r\nfamiliars feel this every day in the withdrawal of their privileges and\r\nexemptions, and it is palpable that in all that does not concern the\r\nfaith, the ancient powers of the tribunal of Aragon are\r\nprostrated.[1116]\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the sullen yielding of the Inquisition to the\r\nchanged situation was manifested in a case which did not tend to restore\r\nit to reverence. Inquisitor Lazaeta was involved in an intrigue with a\r\nmarried woman of San Anton, whose husband, a Catalan named Miguel\r\nChoved, grew suspicious and pretended to take a journey. Lazaeta fell\r\ninto the trap. October 27, 1647, he went to the house at nightfall,\r\nleaving his coach in hiding behind the shambles; the coachman waited for\r\nhim in vain, for the injured husband had entered by a side-door and\r\ngiven him a sword-thrust of which he died in the street, while stumbling\r\nforward in search of his coach. The woman escaped and Choved\r\ndisappeared, but some demonstration was necessary and the tribunal\r\narrested one Francisco Arnal as an accessory. The court of the Justicia\r\nissued a manifestacion in his favor, when the inquisitors complained of\r\nthe interference with their functions of such orders and that the\r\ntribunal could not be maintained if they were to be banished and their\r\ntemporalities be seized whenever they judged that a case was not\r\ncomprehended within the fueros. To this the Council of Aragon replied\r\nthat the court of the Justicia always acted with great caution and that,\r\nin the present case, Arnal had renounced the manifestacion and had been\r\nreturned to the tribunal, which had found him innocent and had\r\ndischarged him. The Suprema insisted that it would be better to remove\r\nthe tribunal from Aragon than to have it subjected to such insults, to\r\nwhich the Council rejoined that there was no admission of firmas and\r\nmanifestaciones except in matters not of faith; if the inquisitors would\r\nkeep within their just limits, such troubles would be avoided, while, if\r\nthey exceeded them, the kingdom must avail itself of the remedies\r\nprovided by the laws.[1117] Now in this case the tribunal was strictly\r\nwithin its rights under the Concordia and its abstention from\r\nexcommunication and interdict indicates how thoroughly it was humbled.\r\n\r\nAnother grievance of the Inquisition shows how completely the tables\r\nwere turned. September 23, 1648, the Suprema represented in a consulta\r\nthat the tribunal had been notified to reduce the number of its\r\nofficials and familiars to the prescribed four hundred and fifty, which\r\nhad not been done under the plea that the number was insufficient, that\r\nthe Concordia did not order the dismissal of the overplus and that the\r\nincumbents could not be deprived of their rights. Still there was little\r\ndoubt that persistent refusal would lead the Diputados to obtain a firma\r\ncompelling a selection and until this was done no familiar would be\r\nallowed to enjoy their privileges--in fact a number of towns had already\r\nassumed this position and others were taking steps to obtain firmas. The\r\nSuprema endeavored to show the illegality of this on the ground that the\r\nConcordia of 1646 was not valid in the absence of confirmation by the\r\ninquisitor-general. Philip submitted this to the Council of Aragon and\r\nmerely transmitted its answer, in non-committal fashion, to the Suprema\r\nfor its information. This took the ground that only the secular and\r\nroyal jurisdiction was concerned; the king had confirmed the laws which\r\nprovided that the acquiescence of the inquisitor-general was\r\nunnecessary; if parties were aggrieved they could apply to the court of\r\nthe Justicia.[1118]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ARAGON_]\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, the laws of 1646, by restricting the tribunal\r\nto its proper functions, were a severe blow to its predominance,\r\ndiminishing the terror which it inspired and affecting in some degree\r\nits finances. The continual suits brought before it had afforded a rich\r\nharvest of fees for its officials and the fines imposed had been a\r\nresource to its treasury. All this fell off greatly and, in 1649, the\r\nSuprema reminded Philip that, in 1646, it had predicted this result and\r\nhe had promised indemnification by a fixed income to be paid by Aragon\r\nor by the royal treasury; although it did not regard the laws as binding\r\nin the absence of confirmation by the inquisitor-general, and had\r\nresisted their execution in every way, still they were executed and the\r\nofficials were suffering keenly from their diminished fees, wherefore it\r\nasked the king to grant to the four notaries and messengers eight\r\nhundred ducats a year out of the fund for the Catalan refugees. This\r\ndemand, and the impudent assertion of the nullity of the laws which he\r\nhad approved, provoked Philip into one of his rare assertions of\r\nkingship. The Catalan fund, he replied, could not be touched; he would\r\nlisten to other suggestions for the relief of the incumbents but not of\r\ntheir successors; he was master of the secular jurisdiction granted to\r\nthe Inquisition for his service and could make laws and abrogate them at\r\nhis pleasure.[1119]\r\n\r\nPhilip had learned a lesson and the laws of 1646 were duly executed.\r\nWhen, in 1677, there was another convocation of the Córtes of Aragon,\r\nthe Suprema, in a suppliant tone contrasting strongly with its former\r\narrogance, begged Carlos II to influence them to condescend to a\r\nmodification. It gave a most dolorous account of the condition of the\r\nSaragossa tribunal resulting from that legislation. It forebore to\r\ndiscuss whether the officials had given just cause of complaint, but the\r\ntotal destruction of the Inquisition was curing one malady by\r\nintroducing a worse one, and the Inquisition of Aragon had been\r\ndestroyed. The number of officials was reduced below that at the time of\r\nits foundation, and its poverty was so great that wages were unpaid and\r\nthe tribunal would probably have to be abandoned. The treasurer was\r\ncompelled to collect its income and debts through the court of the\r\nJusticia, where it was impossible for him to carry on so many suits, so\r\nthat only those paid whose consciences compelled them. The reduction of\r\nthe officials impeded its usefulness; possibly there were fewer culprits\r\nbut certainly there were fewer convictions--less in Aragon than in the\r\nother provinces--and a single one who escaped correction was a matter\r\nof greater consequence to God than the enjoyment of the fuero by five\r\nhundred persons. It was impossible to fill the allotted number of\r\nfamiliars, for the fuero in criminal matters left to them was rather a\r\ndisadvantage, for they died in prison owing to the interminable delays\r\nin settling the numerous competencias, while other defendants were\r\nreleased on bail. At the same time the deprivation of the active fuero\r\nexposed them to the effects of the general hatred felt for them. It was\r\ninconceivable that, in so pious a nation, this hatred could be caused by\r\ntheir functions, but its existence was a matter of experience and, in\r\nthe absence of protection, the risks to which it exposed them prevented\r\nmen from seeking the position. The Inquisition did not desire\r\njurisdiction, but it could not exist without revenue and officials, and\r\nit therefore prayed the king that proper measures of relief be discussed\r\nin the Córtes, or a junta could be formed from both parties and a new\r\nConcordia be framed. Even allowing for customary exaggeration, this\r\npaper shows how greatly the Inquisition had outgrown the functions for\r\nwhich it had been imposed upon the people.\r\n\r\nThe concessions asked for were singularly moderate--that the treasurer\r\nshould not be required to make collections through the court of the\r\nJusticia, that more familiars be allowed--though it had just been said\r\nthat they could not be had--that they be admitted to bail during\r\ncompetencias, and a timid suggestion respecting the firma and\r\nmanifestacion. The time, however, was not propitious even for demands so\r\nmodest. The youthful Carlos II had just relegated his mother to a\r\nconvent and her favorite Valenzuela to the Philippines; all power was in\r\nthe hands of Don Juan of Austria, who held the inquisitor-general\r\nValladares to be his personal enemy. The appeal of the Suprema was\r\nreceived unsympathetically and it seems to have gained nothing. That the\r\nAragonese were content with the situation appears from the fact that the\r\nonly complaint made by the Córtes regarded the non-observance of a law\r\nof 1646 prescribing the number of natives to be employed by the\r\ntribunal, and this arose merely from greed of office, for they suggested\r\nthat, for each foreigner appointed in Aragon, an Aragonese should have a\r\ncorresponding berth in a tribunal elsewhere.[1120]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CATALONIA_]\r\n\r\nThe legislation of 1646 remained a finality. As late as 1741 the Suprema\r\nremonstrated against the Audiencia of Saragossa for impeding the\r\njurisdiction of the tribunal by employing the firma, which, with\r\ncustomary disingenuousness, it characterized as an innovation.[1121]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCatalonia was as intractable as Aragon, while its more pronounced spirit\r\nof independence rendered it particularly troublesome. Although it lacked\r\nthe institution of the Justicia, it had a somewhat imperfect substitute\r\nin the Banch Reyal, or King's Bench, which was used in the appeals _por\r\nvia de fuerza_ from the spiritual courts. The Audiencia summoned the\r\necclesiastical judge before it and his disregard of the summons was\r\nfollowed by a decree of banishment and seizure of temporalities. The\r\ninquisitors denied their liability to this, the Catalans asserted it,\r\nand the endeavor to enforce it was a serious cause of quarrel. It was\r\nnot without influence, for a memorial, in 1632, from the inquisitors\r\ncomplains that the Duke of Maqueda, when viceroy in 1592, had employed\r\nit against the tribunal, since when the veneration felt for the latter\r\nhad greatly declined, and a complaint of the Catalan authorities to\r\nCarlos II, in 1695, describes it as the sole refuge and protection of\r\nthe people from the oppression of the inquisitors and ecclesiastical\r\njudges.[1122]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen the Concordia reached in 1512, abolishing most of\r\nthe then existing abuses; how it was sworn to by king,\r\ninquisitor-general and inquisitors, and how a similar oath was to be\r\ntaken by all future inquisitors; how Leo X obligingly released them all\r\nfrom their oaths; how Ferdinand, just before his death, accepted the\r\nconditions, in December, 1515, and the complaisant pontiff, in the bull\r\n_Pastoralis officii_, confirmed them, and how Barcelona, in return,\r\nbound itself to a yearly subvention of six hundred ducats. It is well to\r\nrecall these facts in view of the bare-faced denials with which\r\nsubsequently the Catalan complaints of non-observance were persistently\r\nmet. Even while the papal dispensation from the oaths was still in\r\nforce, the Instructions issued by Inquisitor-general Mercader, in 1514,\r\nprescribed rules which, if observed, would have removed the leading\r\ncauses of complaint. Any official or familiar committing a crime\r\ndeserving of corporal punishment was to be denounced to him, when he\r\nwould dismiss the culprit and punish the inquisitor who tolerated it.\r\nThe civil suits of officials were to be brought in the court of the\r\ndefendant; if the official was plaintiff, all proceedings before an\r\ninquisitor were pronounced invalid and both official and inquisitor were\r\nto be punished; even when both parties to a contract agreed to accept\r\nthe forum of the tribunal, inquisitors were forbidden, under pain of\r\npunishment, to entertain the case. Secular officials could arrest\r\nfamiliars caught in the act. Officials were forbidden to engage in\r\ntrade, even through third parties, and were deprived of the fuero for\r\nall matters thence arising, and similarly if they purchased claims\r\nsubject to suits, nor could they employ other officials to collect debts\r\nconnected with their private estates.[1123] Although these Instructions\r\nwere in force for only a year or two, they have interest as manifesting\r\nFerdinand's purpose that the Holy Office should not be distracted from\r\nits legitimate functions or be used to oppress his subjects or to\r\nminister to private greed. He could, at the same time, believe that it\r\nrequired special privileges, for it did not as yet inspire awe in so\r\nturbulent a population. In that same year, 1514, at Lérida, the\r\ninquisitor Canon Antist was besieged in his house and the assailants\r\nwere with difficulty beaten off, after which they defiantly walked the\r\nstreets, uttering challenges to his defenders.[1124]\r\n\r\nA further victory was gained by the Catalans at the Córtes of Monzon in\r\n1520, when, on December 28th, Cardinal Adrian, in the most solemn\r\nmanner, not only swore to observe the articles of 1512 but presented for\r\nattestation a document from Queen Juana and Charles V, promising\r\ninvestigation and redress of charges brought against certain officials,\r\nand enacting that, to prevent such abuses for the future, all offences\r\ndisconnected with the faith, committed by officials, should be tried by\r\nthe ordinary courts, thus depriving them of the much-prized criminal\r\npassive fuero. This, too, Adrian swore to observe when the necessary\r\npapal confirmation should be obtained--a confirmation which the\r\nInquisition probably had sufficient influence to prevent, as there\r\nappears to be no further trace of it.[1125]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CATALONIA_]\r\n\r\nThe articles of 1512 thus were a compact in which the Catalans, the\r\nking, the Inquisition and the pope all joined in the most solemn\r\nmanner, pledging all future inquisitors to swear to them. For a while\r\nthis latter clause was observed. Fernando Loazes, who was inquisitor of\r\nBarcelona for twenty years from about 1533, took the oath, but he was\r\npromptly involved in a quarrel with the magistrates in which Juan de\r\nCardona, Bishop-elect of Barcelona, was induced, as papal commissioner,\r\nto prosecute him for perjury, and after that no inquisitor took the\r\noath.[1126] In this they were wise for they emancipated themselves\r\ncompletely from the Concordia. The Córtes of 1547 complained of the\r\ninordinate multiplication of familiars, over the thirty allowed by it,\r\nand of the neglect to furnish lists or other means for their\r\nidentification, together with other infractions, but Prince Philip\r\nreplied that he would consult the Suprema and would reach appropriate\r\nconclusions, which of course ended the matter.[1127] How completely the\r\nprovisions of the Concordia were ignored is manifest in 1551, when\r\nCatalina Murciana asked relief in the veguer's court from suits brought\r\nagainst her in the Inquisition by the fiscal, the Abbot of Besalú, when\r\nshe was entitled to her own court. On refusal of redress by the\r\ninquisitor, Juan Arias, a monitorio was obtained from the Banch Reyal,\r\nwhereupon Arias threw the officials of the veguer's court into prison\r\nand kept them there. The matter was carried up to the Royal Councils\r\nwith the result that the judges of the Audiencia were ordered to erase\r\nall record of the affair from their dockets and appear in person before\r\nthe inquisitor to report to him that it was duly expunged.[1128]\r\n\r\nThus supported by the monarch, the tribunal exercised its powers at\r\ndiscretion without regard to compacts. The report, in 1561, by\r\nInquisitor Gaspar Cervantes of the visitation which he had just\r\ncompleted, describes the disorders which had long reigned in all\r\ndepartments. The last visitation had been made in 1550 and its\r\nrecommendations had been wholly ignored. It had ordered a reduction in\r\nthe number of familiars and that lists of them be sent to the Suprema,\r\nwhich had not been done; in fact the tribunal itself had kept no correct\r\nregister; it had a hundred and eight names recorded for Barcelona, but\r\nwhen they were ordered to present their papers under penalty of being\r\ndropped, only sixty-eight of these came forward, while there were\r\nthirty-one who were not registered. The number, he said, should be\r\nreduced and more care be exercised in the selection; many of the laymen\r\nwere bandits and the clerics were men of bad character, who sought the\r\noffice to obtain exemption from their prelates. All this resulted in so\r\nmuch secular business that it seemed to be the real duty of the tribunal\r\nand that nothing else was attended to--in fact there was so little to do\r\nin matters of faith that the inquisitors could well be spared from\r\nBarcelona and employ themselves in visiting their district. All this is\r\nexplicable by the exorbitance of the fees charged, about which there was\r\nmuch complaint. There was no authorized fee-bill. In civil cases the\r\ninquisitors charged from two and a half to ten per cent. on the amount\r\nat issue, depending on its magnitude, with a maximum of seventy-five\r\nlibras; in criminal cases they received nothing but had the opportunity\r\nof inflicting fines. The officials had fees for every act, drawing and\r\ncopying papers, serving notices, summoning witnesses, levying\r\nexecutions, etc., etc., and there was a standing quarrel between the\r\nnotaries of the three departments--of the _secreto_, or tribunal of\r\nfaith, of sequestrations and of the juzgado, or court of\r\nconfiscations--as to which should have the business.[1129]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CATALONIA_]\r\n\r\nThat the Córtes of Monzon, in 1563-4, should protest energetically\r\nagainst these abuses was natural. Indeed, a Catalan named Gaspar\r\nMercader carried the protest so far as to say, among other odious\r\nthings, that the Inquisition had been introduced only for a limited time\r\nwhich had expired and that it should be abolished, for which the\r\ntribunal arrested, tried and punished him.[1130] In spite of this\r\ninterference with the freedom of debate, the general disaffection, as we\r\nhave seen, led to the visitation of de Soto Salazar. In Barcelona he\r\nfound that not the slightest attention had been paid to the orders of\r\nthe Suprema based on the report of Cervantes. Advocates, familiars and\r\ncommissioners continued to be appointed in profusion, without\r\ninvestigation as to fitness. When an inquisitor visited his district he\r\ncarried with him blank commissions which he distributed at will. All\r\nthese, with their families, were protected and defended by the tribunal\r\nin civil and criminal cases, nor was this all, for it would seem that\r\nany one who claimed the fuero, whether he was entitled to it or not, was\r\nadmitted and, in the absence of lists filed with the magistrates, the\r\nlatter had no means of resisting the arrogant and peremptory demand of\r\nthe tribunal to surrender cases. Instances were given which showed that\r\nthe tribunal was a court where justice--or rather injustice--was bought\r\nand sold and there had been no reform in the excessive fees which had\r\nscandalized Cervantes.[1131]\r\n\r\nThat it should be hated was inevitable. In 1566, Govilla, Bishop of\r\nElna, defending himself for acts committed when he was inquisitor of\r\nBarcelona, declared that the Inquisition was even more odious in\r\nCatalonia than elsewhere.[1132] This hatred sometimes expressed itself\r\nmore forcibly than by complaints. In 1567, the evocation of a case,\r\nwhich the local authorities claimed as their own, led to the fiercest\r\nexcitement which the viceroy fruitlessly sought to allay and appealed to\r\nPhilip II for his immediate interposition. Disregarding the inviolable\r\nsecrecy of the Inquisition, the Diputados, with the veguer, forced their\r\nway into the palace, penetrated to the audience-chamber where the\r\ninquisitors were trying a case, and inventoried and sequestrated\r\neverything, even to the private property of the Inquisitor Padilla in\r\nhis apartments--apparently a seizure of temporalities under an order of\r\nthe Banch Reyal. Even more flagrant was the insult committed when the\r\nmessenger and the secretary were conveying from Perpignan to Barcelona\r\ntwo government officials accused of impeding the Inquisition and also a\r\nprisoner under a charge of heresy. Near Gerona, one of the Diputados, at\r\nthe head of an armed band, seized the whole party and carried them back\r\nto Perpignan, where they were paraded through the streets with blare of\r\ntrumpets, as though criminals on the way to execution, and were then\r\ncast into prison, where they lay until discharged without accusation.\r\nThis was a most serious assault on the dignity of the Holy Office and\r\neven worse was permitting the escape of the heretic, but it was obliged\r\nto submit without vindicating its authority.[1133]\r\n\r\nSuch being the temper of the Catalans and such the provocation to meet\r\nlawlessness with lawlessness, it is not surprising that, when the\r\nConcordia of 1568 was prepared for the three kingdoms, Catalonia would\r\nhave none of it. When, in September, it was submitted to the Diputados,\r\nthey were incensed and proposed to send envoys to the king to\r\nremonstrate against it. There was a universal outcry that it was\r\ncontrary to the constitution and privileges of the land; they would\r\nobserve it in so far as it was in their favor, but as to the rest they\r\nwere ready to lose life, property and children rather than to submit to\r\nit. In February, 1569, the inquisitors wrote that the people would not\r\nbe content until they had driven the Inquisition from the land; as for\r\nthemselves they proposed to go on as they had previously done until the\r\nConcordia should be accepted, to which the Suprema cordially\r\nassented.[1134]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CATALONIA_]\r\n\r\nThis attitude of mutual defiance was not conducive to peace. In 1570,\r\nthere arose a quarrel so bitter that the Diputados invoked the\r\nprotection and interposition of Pius V, and he urged Philip II to come\r\nto some understanding with them, in view of possible serious\r\nconsequences. Philip took the position that they were so excited and so\r\nobstinate that any concessions would lead only to further demands, but\r\nhe asked the pope to dismiss the envoys, referring them to him with\r\nrecommendation for favorable consideration, so that anything that he\r\nmight yield would be to the Holy See and not to recalcitrant subjects.\r\nThe situation was critical; the rebellion of Granada was exhausting his\r\nresources, there was acute apprehension of attack by a Turkish fleet and\r\nthe Catalans were soon afterwards called upon to contribute to the\r\ndefence of the coasts, but if any concessions were enforced on the\r\nInquisition they have left no traces. In fact, the Venetian envoy,\r\nLeonardo Donato, in his relation of 1573, states that, after the\r\nCatalans had spent a hundred thousand ducats in these efforts, the\r\nInquisition imprisoned those who had been most active in the matter and\r\nthat they subsequently refused to leave the prison without a formal\r\ndeclaration that they had not been arrested for heresy.[1135] Dissension\r\nnaturally continued. In 1572 we hear of a demand from the Diputados that\r\nthe inquisitors should show them their commissions and take an oath to\r\nobey the constitution of Catalonia, because they held rents on the\r\nDiputacion; the inquisitors acceded to the first of these and were\r\nrebuked by the Suprema because it was a demand that had been\r\npersistently refused before and they must not do it again. Then, in\r\n1574, there came a complaint from all the cities that familiars refused\r\nobedience to the local laws respecting prices, pasturage and other\r\nmatters as required under the Concordia, to which the Suprema\r\nsuperciliously replied by instructing the inquisitors that, as the\r\npeople had rejected the Concordia, they need not observe it.[1136] Then,\r\nin 1585, as we have seen (p. 416) the Córtes obtained an advantage in\r\nexcluding familiars and officials from public offices.\r\n\r\nIn this spirit of undisguised hostility both sides were aligned for a\r\ndecisive struggle in the Córtes of 1599, under the new royalty of the\r\nyouthful Philip III. As the Catalan efforts failed and the Inquisition\r\nwas left in possession of its usurped powers, the details of the contest\r\nhave no interest except as an exhibition of shameless duplicity, by\r\nwhich the king tricked his vassals. They hoped to win favor by a\r\nsubsidio of a million libras to the king and a hundred thousand to his\r\nbride, besides shrewdly granting ten thousand to the Marquis of Denia\r\n(soon to become Duke of Lerma) and six thousand to the Vice-chancellor\r\nof Aragon,[1137] but they reaped nothing but deceit. Long discussions\r\nresulted in a series of articles, divided into two categories, to one of\r\nwhich Philip gave unqualified assent and to the other his assent as far\r\nas concerned himself, with a promise to procure that of the\r\ninquisitor-general and pope. It was proposed to withhold the pension of\r\nsix hundred libras granted in 1520, if the papal confirmation were not\r\nprocured within a year, but Philip declared that no such guarantee was\r\nnecessary, for the letters which he had ordered to be written to the\r\npope were so strong that no influence could counteract them. His\r\ndespatches to his ambassador were sent through the Diputados in order to\r\nsatisfy them, but they assuredly were not allowed to see others which\r\ninstructed the ambassador to be circumspect in urging the matter. He\r\nalso sent word to the inquisitor-general that the delivery of these\r\ndespatches had been delayed in order to give him time to express his\r\nviews. The Suprema, in appealing to Clement VIII to withhold\r\nconfirmation, did not hesitate to say that Philip had endeavored to\r\nescape under cover of the inquisitor-general and pope and had finally\r\nsigned only in so far as concerned himself. Indeed, in a subsequent\r\nofficial paper, it was unblushingly asserted that he had done so only to\r\nget rid of the Catalans. Under these influences it is needless to say\r\nthat the confirmation never came and the subsidio was the only\r\npractical result of the labors of the Córtes.[1138]\r\n\r\nOne of the articles required the execution of the Concordia of 1520,\r\nwhich embraced that of 1512, the fulfilment of which the Catalans had\r\nnever ceased to demand, and the manner in which these solemn compacts\r\nwere argued away is instructive. In 1566, Govilla, Bishop of Elna, who\r\nhad been inquisitor of Barcelona, calmly asserted that the articles of\r\n1512 had been revoked as prejudicial to the free exercise of the\r\nInquisition. The Suprema, in urging Clement VIII to refuse confirmation\r\nof the new Concordia of 1599, argued that the transactions of 1512 and\r\n1520 were invalid through simony, as the Córtes had obtained the assent\r\nof Ferdinand in 1516 (_sic_) and of Charles in 1520 by conditioning\r\nsubsidios on it. Leo's bull of condemnation in 1513 was relied upon and\r\nthat of confirmation in 1516 was dismissed as obreptitious and\r\nsurreptitious. So Cardinal Adrian's action in 1520 was represented as\r\nconditional on confirmation by the Holy See, and as in no way binding on\r\nthe Inquisition. So, in 1632, the Barcelona tribunal drew up a statement\r\nto be laid before Philip IV by the Suprema, adroitly mixing up the\r\naffairs of Aragon and Catalonia and telling him that the Córtes of 1518\r\ndemanded the revival of the articles of 1512, that Charles refused to\r\nswear to them, that Juan Prat interpolated others, for which he was\r\nimprisoned and that the effort failed. In transmitting this the Suprema\r\nadded that the fact that the Córtes never ceased to demand the\r\nenforcement of the articles showed that they had never been\r\nobserved.[1139] From first to last it was a history of deception, in\r\nwhich kings conspired with inquisitors to betray their subjects, without\r\neven the excuse that the faith was concerned in these details of secular\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CATALONIA_]\r\n\r\nThe Catalan temper was not soothed by the disappointment of 1599, and\r\nthe refusal of redress prompted resort to forcible measures. There was a\r\ncontest in 1608 in which the Banch Reyal uttered a sentence of\r\nbanishment against the inquisitors; a vessel was made ready for their\r\ndeportation but, when the day came, they barred their door and hung over\r\nit a portière of black velvet to which was attached a crucifix. The city\r\nshowed its piety by placing candles in front of the sacred emblem and\r\nthe chapter sent priests to pray before it. No one ventured to disturb\r\nit; the Diputados, the chapter and the city authorities interposed, and\r\nan accommodation was reached.[1140] A more savage quarrel arose, in\r\n1611, in consequence of the veguer disarming the coachman of an\r\ninquisitor. The city authorities seized the temporalities, laid siege to\r\nthe palace of the Inquisition, sentenced the inquisitors to banishment\r\nand proclaimed it with trumpets through the streets. This they justified\r\nto the king by telling him that the Holy Office had been instituted for\r\na limited term which had expired, so that it should be abolished in\r\nCatalonia and the cognizance of matters of faith be restored to the\r\nepiscopal courts, all of which, we are told, gave his majesty much\r\nconcern.[1141]\r\n\r\nMutual detestation did not diminish and, when the Córtes of 1626 were\r\napproaching, the inquisitors anxiously urged the Suprema to impress upon\r\nthe king that the peace and preservation of Catalonia depended upon the\r\nmaintenance of their temporal jurisdiction. The deputies, they said,\r\nwere holding daily juntas and accumulating stores of documents from the\r\narchives, asserting that the time had expired for which the Inquisition\r\nwas instituted, and if they accomplish their intention they will destroy\r\nit wholly. That they were really alarmed is visible in their asking the\r\nSuprema to secure some compromise. The Suprema duly represented the\r\ndanger to Philip IV, who in reply gave assurance that no prejudicial\r\nchange would be approved, for his unceasing desire was to promote the\r\nexaltation of the Inquisition. After the Córtes had assembled, the\r\ntribunal reported, June 27th, that they had drawn up a series of\r\narticles effectually disabling the jurisdiction of the Inquisition and\r\nthat they declare that they will not vote a subsidio until the king\r\nshall have confirmed them. The articles deemed so obnoxious scarce\r\namounted to more than the Concordia of Castile so long in force, save\r\nprovisions that the inquisitors should be Catalans and should take an\r\noath to obey the laws, and that disputes of jurisdiction should be\r\nsettled by a junta consisting of an inquisitor, a judge of the Audiencia\r\nand the Bishop of Barcelona. Moderate as they were, Philip kept his\r\npromise and referred them, September 23d, to Diego de Guzman, Archbishop\r\nof Seville, acting head of the Suprema in the vacancy of the\r\ninquisitor-generalship, so that, on the adjournment of the Córtes, the\r\nwhole matter remained suspended.[1142]\r\n\r\nAn attempt at compromise was made in what was known as the Concordia of\r\nCardinal Zapata, arranged, December 24, 1630, between him as\r\ninquisitor-general and the Council of Aragon. This made no substantial\r\nchange in the jurisdiction of the Inquisition but was directed chiefly\r\nto restraining the misuse of excommunication on the one side and the\r\nrecourse to the Banch Reyal on the other, by providing that all disputed\r\ncases should be settled by competencias conducted according to the\r\nreceived form of procedure, under penalty for a first offence of five\r\nhundred ducats on the tribunal refusing, and suspension from office for\r\na second. This left untouched the roots of trouble and accomplished\r\nlittle, in consequence, it is said, of the delays and evasions of the\r\ninquisitors, and frequent recourse continued to the Banch Reyal,\r\nespecially by creditors.[1143]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CATALONIA_]\r\n\r\nThe Córtes of 1626 had not been dissolved and they met again in 1632 to\r\nconclude their unfinished business. As usual, the tribunal and the\r\nSuprema prepared for the struggle by earnest appeals to Philip, who\r\nresponded with assurances of special care in all that concerned the\r\nInquisition. The Suprema had the hardihood to tell him that the\r\nConcordia of 1512, on which the Catalans based their claims, had never\r\nbeen confirmed, but it was within the truth when it said that it had\r\nnever been observed. It declared moreover that the articles framed by\r\nthe Córtes would so prostrate the tribunal that it would have to cease\r\nits functions. A memorial by the secretary of the tribunal, Miguel\r\nRodríguez, gives a deplorable account of the social condition of\r\nCatalonia, where the barons and gentlemen, the cities and church\r\nfoundations, he says, possessed excessive powers and where the bishops\r\nwere also barons. The hostility of the nobles and cities to the\r\nfamiliars was manifested by the daily murders committed on them and\r\ntheir children and the burning of their houses. But for the protection\r\nof the Inquisition they would be exterminated, for its jurisdiction was\r\nthe only one respected. Fathers endured the murder of their sons, sons\r\nthat of their fathers and wives that of their husbands, for fear of\r\ngreater evils and, in addition to this, was the turbulent temper of the\r\npopulation. The viceroys had nominal power, but it was exercised only on\r\nthe common folk and not on the powerful, whom no one dared to accuse or\r\nto bear witness against. All this busy preparation was superfluous; the\r\nCórtes were dissolved without gaining their object.[1144]\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition, as usual, had triumphed, but peace was impossible\r\nbetween the incompatible claims of rival jurisdictions. In 1637 the\r\nSuprema complained of the continuous series of troubles and of the\r\ndisregard of the Concordia of Zapata. This time the offender was the\r\nviceroy, the powerful Duke of Cardona, who had imprisoned a familiar for\r\ncarrying a pistol and refusing to surrender it, and had arrested two\r\nservants of the receiver, fining one and discharging the other. When the\r\ntribunal sent to him a priest bearing a monitorio with excommunication,\r\nhe shut the priest up, _incomunicado_, in a room of the palace. Then he\r\ninvited to dinner the fiscal of the tribunal and shut him up likewise.\r\nHe ordered the inquisitor to withdraw the excommunication and, on his\r\nrefusal, he pronounced sentence of banishment, posted four hundred men\r\naround the Inquisition and made ready a vessel to carry him to Majorca.\r\nThe inquisitor assembled five bishops who declared that Cardona had\r\nincurred the excommunication of the bull _Si de protegendis_ and the\r\ninquisitor so declared him, though for the avoidance of scandal he\r\nforbore to publish it. Under the intervention of the bishops the\r\nsentences of banishment and excommunication were mutually withdrawn, and\r\nthe viceroy released the priest and fiscal, boasting that he had carried\r\nhis point. Thereupon the Suprema asked the king to execute on Cardona\r\nthe penalties of the Concordia of Zapata and greater ones in view of his\r\nunprecedented acts and also that the _ipso facto_ censures of the canon\r\n_Si quis suadente_ and the bull _Si de protegendis_ be published in\r\norder that he might seek the salvation of his soul. To this the weary\r\nking could only reply by deprecating these unseemly quarrels and\r\nordering that viceroys should not try the cases of familiars--Cardona\r\napparently having undertaken to do this only because there was no other\r\nauthority that ventured to do so, although the offence was one which\r\nforfeited the fuero.[1145] Soon after this, in 1639, a still more\r\nserious trouble broke out in Tortosa, in which the magistrates were\r\ninvolved and the people rose against the Inquisition, but while this was\r\nin progress the Catalan rebellion broke out and prudence counselled\r\nabstention from severe measures of repression.[1146]\r\n\r\nWhatever share the Inquisition may have had in stimulating the\r\ndisaffection that led to the rebellion, the unredressed grievances which\r\nso excited the Córtes nowhere appear on the surface. The proximate\r\ncause, as has been stated above, was the burning of the churches of\r\nMontiró and Rio de Arenas by the Neapolitan troops quartered on the\r\npeople; some consecrated hosts were found reduced to coals and the\r\npeasants, who had suffered from the outrages of the unpaid soldiery,\r\nrose in arms, cut them off in detail, styled themselves the Exercit\r\nChristiá and bore on their banners the Venerable Sacrament, with the\r\nlegend \"Senor judicau vostra causa\" and claimed that their object was to\r\nprotect the people and defend the Catholic faith. In fact, the\r\nInquisition was invited to prosecute the guilty authors of the sacrilege\r\nand undertook to do so, but of course the culprits could not be\r\nidentified and it was reduced to excommunicating them in bulk. It was\r\nagainst the representatives of the king that the initial riots of June 7\r\nand 8, 1640, were directed, when the judges of the royal Audiencia and\r\nthe Viceroy, the Count of Santa Coloma, were murdered. The inquisitors\r\nat once proffered their services to the Diputados and, at the request of\r\nthe latter, they wrote to the king and inquisitor-general praising the\r\nefforts of the Diputados to preserve peace, not knowing that for months\r\nthey had been organizing the rebellion in correspondence with France.\r\nWhen too, in September, a tax was laid to put the land in a state of\r\ndefence, the assent of the tribunal was asked as to levying it on\r\nfamiliars.[1147]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CATALONIA_]\r\n\r\nThere was thus no open hostility towards the Inquisition, but, at the\r\nsame time, there was no respect for its inviolability. When the mob rose\r\nagain on Christmas day, to put to death all Castilians, there was a\r\nreport that two thousand of them were concealed in the Inquisition. Led\r\nby a coachman of one of the inquisitors, the people broke into the\r\nInquisition, maltreated the officials, hanged some of them, emptied the\r\nmoney chests and found in the secret prison a solitary Castilian on\r\ntrial for heresy. Him they carried to the town-council who returned him\r\nto the tribunal and garroted the coachman.[1148]\r\n\r\nWhen, on January 23, 1641, terms of submission to France were concluded,\r\nthe Inquisition was provided for. Having cut loose from Spain, it was\r\nimpossible to permit the tribunal to remain subject to the Suprema in\r\nMadrid, and the clause respecting it was that all inquisitors and\r\nofficials should be Catalans, jurisdiction should be restricted to\r\nmatters of faith, and it should be directly under the Roman Congregation\r\nof the Holy Office.[1149] Still the inquisitors remained at their posts;\r\nfor five months they had had no word from the Suprema; they expected to\r\nbe called upon to take the oath of allegiance to King Louis and they\r\nsent their secretary, Juan de Eraso, to Madrid for instructions,\r\nsuggesting that they had better move to Tarragona or Tortosa. Philip\r\nordered them to remain and they resolutely obeyed, but the situation\r\ngrew constantly worse and, on November 7th, they made another appeal,\r\nrepresenting their danger, their destitution, their inability to perform\r\ntheir functions, and their expectation that they would be forced to kiss\r\nthe hands of the Marshal de Brézé, the approaching French governor. This\r\nwas confirmed by Don Antonio de Aragon, who had just returned from\r\nBarcelona; on two occasions the mob had set fire to the Inquisition and\r\nheresy was rampant, for many of the French troops were Calvinists and\r\nCalvinism was openly preached. The Suprema characteristically debated\r\nthe question under four heads--Shall the Inquisition be removed to\r\nTarragona or Tortosa? Shall the inquisitors kiss the hands of the French\r\ngovernor? Does their lack of means to prosecute relieve them from\r\nprosecuting native or French heretics? Shall testimony against such\r\nheretics be taken in Madrid and action be based on it? After elaborate\r\ndiscussion the fourth question was decided in the affirmative and the\r\nother three in the negative. Juan de Mañozca was appointed to gather\r\ntestimony in Madrid, and the inquisitors were told to stand their ground\r\nand do their duty, using censures and interdict if necessary. If driven\r\nfrom the town, they were to carry with them the records so as to be able\r\nto work elsewhere.[1150]\r\n\r\nOne of the inquisitors, Dr. Cotoner, had left Barcelona for his home in\r\nMajorca. The other two, with most of the officials, stood to their post\r\nand, in August, 1643, they were called upon to utter fearful curses on\r\nunknown parties supposed to have committed a sacrilegious theft of\r\nconsecrated hosts.[1151] Towards the end of September, however, they\r\nwere expelled, to give place to a native tribunal, and it was done with\r\na refinement of cruelty. There were ten in all--seven subordinates and\r\nthe son of one of them, besides the two inquisitors--who had stood\r\nfaithful to their duty. They were put on board a vessel, with orders to\r\nland them in Portugal, which, like Catalonia, was in revolt against\r\nSpain. Although the crew consisted of Catalans and Frenchmen, they were\r\npersuaded to put into Cartagena, with a promise of being allowed to sell\r\ntheir cargo there. The reception of the refugees was most inhospitable;\r\nthe vessel was seized and the cargo and effects of passengers and crew\r\nwere embargoed: much red tape had to be cut and it was not until\r\nDecember that the conclusion was reached that the crew had rendered an\r\nessential service exposing them to punishment by the rebels, wherefore\r\nthe vessel was released and they were allowed to dispose of the\r\ncargo.[1152]\r\n\r\nThe refugees were without salaries or resources and it was not without\r\ndifficulty and delay that the Suprema, professing its own inability to\r\nhelp them, secured from Philip some moderate _ayudas de costa_ to keep\r\nthem alive. Then, in March, 1644, it ordered them to open a tribunal at\r\nTarragona, at the same time representing to the king that this would\r\ncost forty-five hundred ducats in silver for the first year, and four\r\nthousand annually thereafter, which might be supplied from the two\r\nmillions of maravedís coming from the tribunal of Cartagena--apparently\r\nsome recent large confiscation--as otherwise they would die of\r\nstarvation. They were doubtless thus provided for and did what they\r\ncould to restore the old-time dread of the Holy Office. It had sadly\r\ndiminished in these evil days for, in this same year, 1644, in the\r\nneighboring town of Tortosa, Inquisitor Roig of Valencia complained\r\nthat, on reaching there during his visitation, the magistrates did not\r\ncome to receive him, they assigned him no lodgings and they refused to\r\npublish his proclamation.[1153]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CATALONIA_]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in accordance with the terms arranged with France, the\r\nCatalans had organized a national Inquisition. Doctor Paulo Ferran and\r\nDoctor Joseph Pla were appointed and application was made for the usual\r\npapal faculties. These were granted and, when the briefs were received,\r\nSeptember 26, 1643, they were installed and the Castilians were\r\nexpelled. The new tribunal had not much to do. It did not meddle with\r\nthe Calvinists in the French armies, but it vindicated its authority by\r\nan auto de fe, celebrated February 23, 1644, in which one victim was\r\ngarroted and burnt and there were two penitents. There was another,\r\nNovember 7, 1647, in which there was an execution for unnatural crime\r\nand six men and five women penitents, mostly for bigamy and sorcery. The\r\nonly other evidence of activity that I have met is an investigation\r\nordered by Pla, at the request of the parish priest of Pineda, resulting\r\nin the trial of Anthoni Morell.[1154]\r\n\r\nWhen the troubles of the Fronde compelled Mazarin to withdraw the French\r\narmies, the rebellion collapsed, in spite of the obstinate determination\r\nof the Catalans to sever relations with Castile. When Barcelona\r\nsurrendered, October 11, 1652, Catalonia was left at the mercy of the\r\nconqueror, but Philip, with true statesmanship, restored it to its\r\nancient privileges and liberties, save a few exceptions which have no\r\nbearing on our subject.[1155] Inquisitor Pla had lingered at Gerona,\r\ncontinuing his functions in virtue of his papal brief. He was found\r\nthere by the Marquis of Olias y Mortara, who only ventured to suspend\r\nhim and wrote to the king, October 12, 1652, for instructions, adding\r\nthat the prompt re-establishment of the Inquisition would conduce\r\ngreatly to the pacification of the land. The Council of Aragon, November\r\n16th, approved of this and the next day Philip instructed the\r\ninquisitor-general to make the appointments and despatch the inquisitors\r\nat once.[1156] There were financial difficulties, however. January 18,\r\n1653, the Suprema reported the appointments; the infection of heresy by\r\nthe French promised much work, but there was an utter lack of money; the\r\ntribunal would cost six thousand ducats a year, while its resources were\r\nbut two thousand, for the separation of Roussillon lost it a thousand\r\nand it had two thousand more in Barcelona loans which were\r\nincollectable; there was prospect however of large confiscations, for\r\nmany Catalans had fled to France who would be prosecuted and, on the\r\nstrength of this, the king was asked for four thousand a year.[1157] The\r\nadjustment of these questions probably required time, for it was not\r\nuntil August 2d that the new inquisitors took possession of their\r\noffice, riding in state through the city, with drums and trumpets and\r\nthe standard of the Holy Office, followed by all the familiars and\r\nofficials of Barcelona, and making public proclamation in the customary\r\nplaces. The next day, Sunday, the Edict of Faith was read and on Monday\r\nthey commenced their functions. Of the Catalan inquisitors, Pla died\r\nwithin a few days and Ferran was arrested at night as were many others,\r\nsome of whom were sent to France and others were deported to Majorca.\r\nApparently their official acts were not recognized, for familiars of\r\ntheir appointment continued for some years to apply for\r\nreinstatement.[1158]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CATALONIA_]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the tribunal re-established than the old troubles\r\nrecommenced. Abuses must have been flagrant to call forth from Philip,\r\nJune 2, 1661, a cédula ordering the exact observance of the Concordias\r\nand restraining the excessive use of excommunication.[1159] The quarrels\r\nwhich arose were prolonged and complicated by every possible device. On\r\nFebruary 15, 1664, Juan Matheu, actual receiver and acting alguazil\r\nmayor of the tribunal, was murdered. On most slender suspicion, the next\r\nday, it arrested Joseph Guimart and Joseph Massart; the Audiencia\r\nclaimed the case and the tribunal refused to enter into a competencia\r\nuntil the Banch Reyal threatened the inquisitors with banishment. Then\r\nthey averted the preliminary conference by questions of etiquette,\r\nrepeatedly disregarding the orders of the Suprema, until the\r\nintervention of the queen-regent enforced obedience. The conference was\r\nat last held and the papers were transmitted to the Suprema and Council\r\nof Aragon to decide as to the jurisdiction. While this was pending, the\r\ninquisitors started another trouble. They had confined the prisoners in\r\nthe secret prison as though guilty of heresy. This was a grievous\r\nhardship and the queen ordered them transferred to the common prison;\r\nthe inquisitors reported that this had been done and then, on pretext\r\nof information as to a plot to escape, brought them back to the secret\r\nprison. When the Suprema heard of this it wrote in a tone of mingled\r\nanger and fear, lest it should be discovered by the Council of Aragon;\r\nthe prisoners must be moved back again; the affair had become too\r\nimportant, the Council of Aragon had made too many efforts and the queen\r\nimputed it all to the Suprema as they would see by her enclosed order.\r\nThen the competencia was suspended by the escape of the prisoners, March\r\n9, 1666, and the last we hear of the matter is their negotiation for a\r\npardon, in 1668, on terms of which the viceroy advised the acceptance,\r\nin order to avoid decision of the competencia. It was doubtless so\r\nsettled, for competing jurisdictions had brought the administration of\r\njustice into such shape that it was better to let criminal accusations\r\nremain untried than to decide between the rival claims.[1160]\r\n\r\nThese quarrels were not merely occasional but were continuous and\r\nperpetual. A letter of June 18, 1667, happens to mention that there were\r\nthen four or five competencias delayed by the question whether in the\r\nconferences the royal judge should bring his own notary.[1161] Perverted\r\ningenuity was constantly devising new points over which strife could be\r\ncreated. Prisoners on trial in the royal gaols were sometimes borrowed\r\nby the tribunal to be prosecuted for blasphemy or other trivial offence\r\nagainst the faith. In 1666 a case of this kind gave rise to a question\r\nas to the exact form of receipt to be given for the body of the culprit,\r\nwhen it was pushed to such a point that the Suprema ordered the\r\nexcommunication of all the judges of the Audiencia, and the Council of\r\nAragon complained to the queen-regent about the oppressive abuse of\r\ncensures and asked her to provide that for the future the mutual\r\nobligations of the two tribunals should be equal and reciprocal.[1162]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CATALONIA_]\r\n\r\nWhen the Inquisition took such pains to make itself detested, one is\r\nscarce surprised to learn, from a complaint of the Suprema in 1677, that\r\nin Barcelona it had so fallen in public esteem that it was able to\r\nprocure but one familiar and that the alguazil mayor had asked to be\r\nrelieved from carrying his wand of office, for no noble was willing to\r\nbe seen walking with him when he bore it.[1163] This hostility it\r\ncontinued carefully to cultivate. In December, 1695, the Diputados and\r\njudges addressed to Carlos II a complaint of the multiplied excesses of\r\nthe tribunal, which trampled on the laws and liberties of the land,\r\ncausing such scandals that they could no longer be endured in silence.\r\nThis had been especially the case since Bartolomé Antonio Sans y Muñoz\r\nhad been inquisitor, whose methods can be appreciated by a single\r\nexample. Captain-general Marquis of Gastañara, had imprisoned a\r\nFrenchman named Jaime Balle, on a matter of state, Spain being at the\r\ntime at war with France, with strict orders to keep him _incomunicado_.\r\nMuñoz suddenly demanded an opportunity of taking testimony of him.\r\nGastañara was absent and no one had authority to violate his\r\ninstructions, but the regent of the royal chancery and the gaoler\r\noffered, if Muñoz would declare it to be a matter of faith, to endeavor\r\nto find some means of compliance. This assurance he refused to give,\r\neven verbally, and he threatened the regent with excommunication. The\r\nAudiencia invited him to a conference, which he refused and it then\r\ncited him before the Banch Reyal, with the customary warning of\r\nbanishment and seizure of temporalities. Muñoz responded, December 29th,\r\nwith a mandate to the regent ordering him, under pain of\r\nexcommunication, to allow the deposition of the prisoner to be taken and\r\nhe followed this, within an hour, with an excommunication published in\r\nall the pulpits and affixed to all the church-doors. The next day this\r\nwas re-aggravated and the regent was publicly cursed with the awful\r\nanathema formulated for hardened and impenitent sinners. The Audiencia\r\nrejoined with the decree of banishment and seizure of temporalities,\r\nunder the customary term of fifteen days. The tribunal answered this\r\nwith a threat of interdict on the city; it convoked all the superiors of\r\nthe religious Orders and arranged with the clergy for a great procession\r\nwhen it should take its departure. It kept its doors closed and even\r\nrefused to receive the messengers of Gastañara, who had hastened back to\r\nBarcelona, but he delayed further action until he should communicate\r\nwith Madrid and receive the royal orders. When they came, on January 11,\r\n1696, he was at Montealegre, a couple of leagues from the city; they\r\nwere sent to him by a special courier and he returned the next morning\r\nand made secret arrangements for their execution. At 2 P.M. he sent\r\nword to Muñoz that he wished to see him on the king's service. At 4.30\r\nP.M. Muñoz came, bringing the fiscal with him. A scrivener was\r\nintroduced who read to him the king's order, which he said he was ready\r\nto obey. Gastañara told him that he must start at once; a coach was at\r\nthe door to which he was escorted with all honor; lackeys with flambeaux\r\nwere ready and a guard of twenty-five musketeers. Gastañara gave him\r\nmoney and he was provided with all comforts, even to a courteous\r\ngentleman as a companion to enforce all proper respect for him. As he\r\nwas leaving the palace, his violent temper burst forth in regrets that\r\nhe had not been allowed time to cast the interdict on the city. He was\r\ndriven to the embarcadero, placed on board a vessel that had been made\r\nready and was conveyed to the nearest Valencian port. It is symptomatic\r\nof Spanish conditions that in war-time the captain-general was obliged\r\nto abandon all other duties and devote a day to kidnapping a troublesome\r\npriest, and this is emphasized by the fact that the inquisitor-general\r\nrewarded the conduct of Muñoz by appointing him to one of the most\r\ndesirable tribunals of Spain.[1164] Possibly this affair may have\r\ninfluenced Carlos II in reissuing, in 1696, his father's injunction of\r\n1661 to observe the Concordias exactly and to be more sparing of\r\nexcommunications.[1165]\r\n\r\nPhilip V was scarce seated on the throne when he found himself\r\nconfronted with the eternal question of Catalan hostility towards the\r\ntribunal. A consulta of the Suprema, October 16, 1701, warns him that\r\nthe inquisitors of Barcelona report that, in the Córtes about to\r\nassemble, efforts will be made to limit its usefulness and he is\r\nexhorted to follow the example of his predecessors.[1166] Whatever was\r\ndone was of little consequence for, in the war which broke out soon\r\nafterwards, Catalonia enthusiastically acknowledged the Archduke Charles\r\nas Carlos III and became the stronghold of the Austrian party. The\r\nsituation of the rebellion of 1640-52 was duplicated. The tribunal was\r\nwithdrawn, but seems to have been replaced by a local organization, for\r\nan article of the Córtes of 1706, duly approved by the Austrian Carlos,\r\nregulating the insaculacion for public office, recognizes its\r\ncertificates respecting its officials.[1167] Of course it could exercise\r\nno jurisdiction over the heretic English allies; it has left no traces\r\nof its activity and was replaced by a revival of the episcopal\r\ncognizance of heresy. As to places beyond the control of the Austrian\r\nparty, a provision of the Suprema, March 16, 1706, extended the\r\njurisdiction of the Saragossa tribunal over all that should be recovered\r\nfrom the enemy until such time as the Inquisition of Barcelona should be\r\nre-established.[1168] The desperate resistance of the Catalans postponed\r\nthis until 1715, and when the tribunal was reinstated it found in the\r\nsecret prison two captives, Juan Castillo a bigamist and Mariana Costa\r\naccused of sorcery, both of them confined by order of the vicar-general\r\nof the diocese.[1169] As all the liberties and privileges of Catalonia\r\nwere abolished by the conquerors, its subsequent relations with the\r\nInquisition offer no special characteristics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MAJORCA-CASTILE_]\r\n\r\nMajorca had no Concordia and its tribunal was free to claim what extent\r\nof jurisdiction it saw fit, limited only by the resistance of the civil\r\nauthorities, which, as we have seen, was energetically expressed at an\r\nearly period. As defined by Portocarrero, in 1623, in practice it\r\nasserted complete jurisdiction, active and passive, in civil and\r\ncriminal cases, over its salaried and commissioned officials and their\r\nfamilies; over familiars, in criminal matters, active and passive; in\r\ncivil, passive only, with exclusion of their families.[1170] The\r\noccasion of his book was a violent struggle between the viceroy and the\r\ntribunal, which presents the ordinary features of these contests for\r\nsupremacy between rival departments of the government. In a search for\r\narms in the house of Juan Zuñez, receiver of confiscations, some were\r\nfound. The viceroy at once arrested him, sentenced him to leave the\r\nisland within twenty-four hours and shipped him away. The inquisitor\r\npromptly excommunicated the viceroy; the royal fiscal appealed; the\r\nviceroy and royal judges summoned the inquisitor to a conference\r\npreparatory to a competencia or to appear in the Banch Reyal and defend\r\nhis proceedings. On his refusal the Banch Reyal pronounced sentence of\r\nbanishment and seizure of temporalities, which was published with sound\r\nof drum and trumpet. They also issued an edict declaring the censures\r\nnull and void and ordering the clergy to disregard them; they refused to\r\nconsider themselves excommunicated, they attended mass and apparently\r\nhad the support of the people and clergy, for no attention was paid to\r\nthe interdict cast on the city by the inquisitor.[1171] What was the\r\nfinal result does not appear, nor does it much matter; the significance\r\nin these affairs is the spectacle presented to the people of lawless\r\ncollisions between the representatives and exponents of the law.\r\n\r\nIn Majorca the most impressive cases of this kind occurred between the\r\nInquisition and the ecclesiastical courts and will be considered\r\nhereafter. It suffices here to say that broils with the secular\r\nauthorities were constant and contributed their share to occupy and\r\ndistract the attention of the central government. It would be\r\nsuperfluous to enumerate those of which the details have chanced to\r\nreach us; they would merely prove that, considering their small size and\r\nscanty population, the Balearic Isles were not behind their continental\r\nsisters of Aragon in adding to the perplexities of the monarchy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis somewhat prolonged recital of the struggles of the kingdoms of the\r\nCrown of Aragon gives an opportunity of realizing the stubborn\r\nresistance, to the arrogant pretensions of the Inquisition, of provinces\r\nwhich still retained institutions through which public opinion could\r\nassert itself. The people of the kingdoms of Castile had been reduced to\r\nsubmission under the absolutism of the House of Austria and, though they\r\nmight at times complain, they could make no effective efforts to\r\nameliorate their position. When, in 1579 and again in 1583, the Córtes\r\nof Castile complained of the arrest and immurement in the secret prisons\r\nof individuals in every quarrel with an official of the Inquisition, to\r\nthe permanent disgrace of families, Philip II merely replied that he\r\nwould make inquiry and take such action as was fitting.[1172] The only\r\nresource was to raise contests in individual cases and these were\r\nfrequent enough and violent enough to prove that there was the same\r\nspirit of opposition to inquisitorial encroachment and the same\r\npervading discontent with the abuses flourishing so rankly under\r\ninquisitorial protection. Instances of this could be cited almost\r\nwithout limit, but one or two will suffice as examples of the multiform\r\naspect of these quarrels and the temper in which they were fought over.\r\nIt should be borne in mind that, in these struggles as in those of\r\nAragon, there was no question of freedom of conscience and no desire to\r\nlimit the effectiveness of the Holy Office as the guardian of purity of\r\nfaith. The Castilian, like the Catalan, looked with exultation on the\r\ntriumph over heresy in the autos de fe, and he desired only to set\r\nbounds to the intrusion of the Inquisition on the field of secular\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CASTILE_]\r\n\r\nThe chancellery of Granada was the supreme tribunal of New Castile as\r\nthat of Valladolid was of Old Castile. The alcaldes of its Sala del\r\nCrimen constituted the highest criminal court, from which there was no\r\nappeal save to God. April 15, 1623, the alcalde mayor, after five days'\r\ntrial, condemned Gerónimo Palomino, an habitual criminal and _rufian_,\r\nto two hundred lashes and six years of galleys for various offences,\r\nincluding sundry blasphemies; on the 24th, the Sala confirmed the\r\nsentence and ordered its execution. On the same day the Inquisition\r\nserved two notices on the alcalde mayor prohibiting his cognizance of\r\nthe case, as some of the alleged crimes concerned the faith, over which\r\nit had exclusive jurisdiction, and it demanded the surrender of the\r\naccused and of all the papers under the customary comminations. The\r\nalcalde mayor responded by calling for a competencia and offering to\r\ndeliver Palomino for trial on any charges of heresy, if record were made\r\nthat he was already a galley-slave to be returned to the royal prison.\r\nThe next day the tribunal sent to the prison and claimed him, on the\r\npretext that the case had been transferred to it, whereupon the alcaide\r\nof the prison surrendered him without orders from the judges. When the\r\nlatter heard of this they also learned that the transfer had been\r\neffected through the efforts of the prisoner's friends and liberal\r\nbribery of the officials of the tribunal, who had been active in getting\r\nhim out of prison. After satisfying themselves of this by investigation,\r\nthey ordered the arrest of four laymen--a notary, a messenger and two\r\nfamiliars--and they further imprisoned in their houses the alcalde mayor\r\nand alcaide of the prison for acting without informing the Sala. The\r\ntribunal concluded Palomino's trial within forty-eight hours, sentencing\r\nhim to hear a mass in the audience chamber, and it appears that it\r\nreturned him. It further commenced proceedings against the alcaldes,\r\nsummoning them to liberate the officials within three hours under pain\r\nof excommunication. The alcaldes protested against this and demanded a\r\ncompetencia, as provided under the Concordia, but the next day they were\r\nexcommunicated in all the churches and this was followed by an interdict\r\nlaid on the city. This forced a compromise by which the prisoners were\r\nliberated, subject to rearrest in case the competencia should result in\r\njustifying the alcaldes, and the latter were absolved from the censures.\r\nThe matter seemed to be settled, but all parties had counted without the\r\nimpetuous and aggressive Inquisitor-general Pacheco. Without awaiting\r\nfurther information, and in disregard of the laws prescribing peaceful\r\nsettlement by competencias, he had evoked the case to himself and acted\r\nupon it off-hand. Two days after the absolution, the inquisitors\r\nreimposed the excommunication by his command, and notices were served on\r\nthe alcaldes and their alguazil mayor to appear before him within\r\nfifteen days to stand trial. Against this they protested and, on their\r\nfailure to appear, they were not only excommunicated afresh but\r\nanathematized in all the churches. The scandal had thus assumed national\r\nproportions.[1173]\r\n\r\nThe alcaldes were the direct and highest judicial representatives of the\r\nking, but such was Philip's subservience to the Inquisition that he\r\nwould not permit a competencia following the regular course but took the\r\naffair into his own hands. The President of the Council of Castile, in\r\nremitting to the royal favorite Olivares, July 4, 1623, a memorial from\r\nthe Council, declared that the condition to which the chancellery of\r\nGranada was reduced, owing to the methods of the Inquisition, was the\r\nmost ignominious that had ever been heard of in Spain, especially\r\nconsidering how slight was the cause of all this disquiet, for, when\r\neverything was settled it was again enkindled at the mandate of the\r\ninquisitor-general. As the matter was in the king's hands, the Council\r\ncould do nothing but appeal to his majesty, with all the disadvantages\r\nunder which it labored in combating the inquisitor-general; had its\r\nhands been free it might already have conquered, to the benefit of the\r\nroyal jurisdiction and service of the king, for every day brought\r\ngreater disturbance to the Republic.[1174]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this appeal, Philip decided in favor of the Inquisition and\r\nthe humiliation of the chancellery was complete. Yet Pacheco was not\r\nsatisfied with victory and proceeded to trample on the vanquished. In\r\nthe course of the quarrel, Gudiel de Peralta, one of the judges, and\r\nMatias González de Sepúlveda, the fiscal of the court, had drawn up\r\nlegal arguments in its justification. These Pacheco submitted to his\r\ncensors, who of course discovered latent heresies lurking in them,\r\nwhereupon he ordered them to be suppressed as heretical and announced\r\nhis intention of proceeding rigorously against the authors. The Council,\r\non October 7th, again appealed to Philip. The accused, it said, had only\r\ndefended the royal jurisdiction in a perfectly legitimate manner; the\r\ninquisitor-general should not have attacked royal officials and\r\ninflicted irreparable injury on them and their posterity by denouncing\r\nthem as heretics, without consulting the king. He was begged to\r\nintervene and order Pacheco to suspend proceedings, while a junta of the\r\ntwo Councils should consider the papers and decide what course should be\r\ntaken.[1175] It is probable that in some such way this indefensible\r\nattempt was suppressed, for neither of the inculpated names appear in\r\nthe Expurgatory Index of Zapata, in 1632.\r\n\r\nIt would seem difficult to set bounds to the power of an organization\r\nwhich could thus arbitrarily employ the censures of the Church on any\r\ndepartment of the government, without being subject to control save to\r\nthat of a king docile to its exigencies. Yet the Suprema, which always\r\nsustained the tribunals in their wanton excesses, adopted their quarrels\r\nand fought them unsparingly to the end, was thoroughly conscious of\r\ntheir wrong-doing. While this conflict was in progress, it issued a\r\ncarta acordada, April 23d, earnestly exhorting the tribunals to maintain\r\nfriendly relations with the royal officials and not to waste time in\r\ndissensions to the neglect of their duties in matters of faith;\r\ncompetencias were always to be admitted and no censures were to be\r\nemployed without consulting the Suprema, unless delay was\r\ninadmissible.[1176]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CASTILE_]\r\n\r\nHow nugatory were these counsels of moderation, under the dominance of\r\nsuch a man as Pacheco, was soon afterwards manifested in a still more\r\nscandalous outbreak in Seville, under his direction, in 1625. The\r\nassistente or governor, Fernando Ramírez Fariñas, himself a member of\r\nthe Council of Castile and a man of high consideration, was\r\nexcommunicated and thus prevented from concluding a negotiation for a\r\ndonation to the king of eighty thousand ducats; his alguazil, an\r\nhonorable man, was wounded and was shut up in prison to keep him out of\r\nthe hands of the tribunal, which declared that he was wanted on a matter\r\nof faith, thus covering him and his family with infamy. The king and\r\nOlivares were besieged by Pacheco on the one hand and the Council of\r\nCastile on the other. The king, as usual, sided with the Inquisition and\r\nthe President of the Council tendered his resignation with the\r\nsuggestion that his office had better be given to Pacheco who, by\r\nholding both positions, could cover up these scandals, while the royal\r\njurisdiction could scarce be reduced to greater degradation. It is no\r\nwonder that Olivares, in a letter to the president, declared himself to\r\nbe the most unfortunate of men, for he could satisfy nobody; his best\r\ncourse would be to ask the king to let him abandon the management of\r\naffairs; when the kingdom was in such straits that he could scarce take\r\ntime to breathe in devising remedies, his efforts were wasted in\r\ncompetencias and he concluded with the despairing declaration that he\r\nlost his senses in thinking over it without knowing what to say.[1177]\r\n\r\nThe statesmen who were guiding the destinies of Spain in those perilous\r\ntimes might well groan under the superfluous burden of deciding these\r\ncontests over trifles so ferociously waged, but they were not to be\r\nspared. Arce y Reynoso was not so violent as Pacheco but he was equally\r\nobstinate and was determined to emancipate the Inquisition wholly by\r\nrelieving it from royal supervision. There was an instructive case at\r\nCuenca, in 1645, where the corregidor, Don Alonso Muñoz de Castilblanque\r\nsent a band of assassins to murder a woman with whom he had illicit\r\nrelations, together with a priest named Jacinto. The crime created great\r\nexcitement, but Muñoz was a contador, or accountant of the tribunal, and\r\nas such a titular official. He presented himself before the inquisitors\r\nwho assumed his case and promptly excommunicated the judge who attempted\r\nto prosecute him. Philip had the matter investigated and was told that\r\nboth the woman and the priest had been killed. He sent to the Suprema a\r\ndecree ordering the removal of the excommunication and the delivery of\r\nthe criminal to the Council of Castile, to be tried by the judge which\r\nit had appointed, for the inquisitors could not properly punish so\r\natrocious a crime without incurring irregularity. This was clear and\r\nperemptory enough, but, in place of obeying it, Arce y Reynoso replied,\r\nMay 4, 1645, that this would be a great and unheard of violation of the\r\nrights of the Holy Office. The woman was not dead but was in Valencia,\r\nwhere the tribunal was busily collecting evidence; to hand Muñoz over to\r\nthe secular judges for trial and execution would incur the same\r\nirregularity as sentencing him; the case would be tried by the Suprema,\r\nwhich had a wide range of suitable penalties that did not infer\r\nirregularity; meanwhile Muñoz would be safely guarded and he trusted\r\nthat the king would not set so pernicious an example.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip rejected this appeal and repeated his order, a learned and\r\nelaborate argument was prepared to show that he had no power to\r\ninterfere. It took the ground, to which we have already referred, that\r\nthe temporal jurisdiction of the Inquisition over its officials was a\r\ngrant from the papacy; it was exclusive and unlimited and no secular\r\nruler could deprive the Holy Office of it; the pope had power to make\r\nthis grant and the king had none to remove this or any other case from\r\nits cognizance, for he was not supreme over the ecclesiastical and papal\r\njurisdiction--the truth being that the papal commissions to the\r\ninquisitor-general conferred power to remove and punish subordinates but\r\nsaid nothing as to its being exclusive, and equally fallacious was the\r\ncitation of three authorities whose utterances had no bearing on the\r\nquestion at issue.[1178] This audacious reliance on the ignorance of\r\nPhilip and his secular advisers was successful. Philip made one or two\r\nefforts more, but Arce y Reynoso held good. A memorial, in 1648, on the\r\ngeneral subject, from a member of the Council of Castile, tells the king\r\nthat his repeated commands in the case of Muñoz had been disobeyed and\r\nthat, although the criminal had so long been in the hands of the\r\ninquisitors, he had not yet been sentenced, which he held to be clear\r\nproof that their aim was to defend their officials from the royal\r\njustice and not to punish them.[1179]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CASTILE_]\r\n\r\nHow liberal was the construction placed on this term of titular official\r\nwas illustrated when, in 1622, at Toledo, the corregidor arrested the\r\nbutcher of the tribunal for intolerable frauds on the public. The\r\ninquisitor demanded the prisoner and the papers, published the\r\ncorregidor in all the churches as excommunicate, seized the alguazil and\r\napparitor who had made the arrest, cast them into the secret prison,\r\ntried them as if for heresy, shaved their heads and beards and banished\r\nthem and refused to their families any evidence that would preserve\r\ntheir posterity from infamy. There was danger of a rising in Toledo\r\nagainst the Inquisition, but it was averted; the Council of Castile\r\nprotested and a junta was held which adopted measures to prevent a\r\nrepetition of such outrages but, as usual, no attention was paid to\r\nthem.[1180]\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to multiply examples of the perennial struggle\r\nwhich was distracting the energies of the government and weakening the\r\nrespect for law in every quarter of Spain. Each tribunal contributed its\r\nshare, and there was an unending stream of cases pouring into Madrid for\r\nsettlement. Each side blamed the other for this anomalous condition. In\r\n1632, the Suprema, in defending the tribunal of Valencia for its\r\nprotection of criminal familiars, bitterly complained that the object of\r\nthe Concordias was the relief of the tribunals, the punishment of\r\noffenders, the quick despatch of cases, and the diminished oppression of\r\npleaders, but that this had been converted into perpetual strife,\r\nregardless of forms and rules of procedure.[1181] For this it was itself\r\nprimarily to blame, for though there were doubtless faults on both\r\nsides, the cases recorded in the reports and the arguments of the\r\nInquisition show that it was the chief offender. Its aggressive powers\r\nwere too much greater than those of its adversaries, and its methods\r\nwere too sharp, for the secular authorities often to risk the\r\nconsequences of being in the wrong.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SPIRITUAL COURTS_]\r\n\r\nThere was another direction in which the Holy Office sought to interfere\r\nwith the administration of justice. So complete is the independence of\r\nsecular authority claimed by the Church for those in holy orders, that a\r\nlicence from a bishop is held to be necessary before a cleric can obey a\r\nsummons to appear as a witness in a lay court, even in civil\r\ncases.[1182] The Inquisition included this among the exemptions of all\r\nconnected with it, whether lay or clerical, and even extended it to\r\nfamiliars. The privilege seems generally to have been conceded, as\r\nrespects the salaried officials but, as applied to familiars, it was too\r\ngrotesque not to excite opposition. The Concordia of 1568, as we have\r\nseen, provided that familiars should testify before secular judges\r\nwithout requiring licence from inquisitors and that the latter should\r\nnot prohibit them from so doing, which infers that it was an abuse\r\nrequiring correction and also that officials were conceded to enjoy the\r\nexemption. The power to summon a witness necessarily includes that of\r\ncoercing him to testify, and this was exercised by imprisoning\r\nrecalcitrants, which came to be regarded as an infraction of privilege.\r\nIn 1649, in the case of Claudio Bolano, a familiar imprisoned for\r\nrefusing to give evidence, the tribunal of Valencia formed a\r\ncompetencia, pending which he was released under bail to both\r\njurisdictions. The question was of difficult solution and the\r\ncompetencia dragged on for ten years without settlement. Then, in 1659,\r\nthe same thing occurred and another competencia was formed, in which the\r\nmost that the Inquisition would concede was that, when the evidence was\r\nindispensable, a notary should be sent to the familiar's house to take\r\nit in secret, basing this upon the danger to which witnesses were\r\nexposed in the violent factions of the time.[1183] The question,\r\nhowever, was settled, in 1699, in the case of Felipe Bru. At Játiva, on\r\nAugust 14, 1698, Don Luis Salzedo, Lord of Pamis, was shot and killed\r\nwhen standing at a window of his house. Don Vicente Monserrat, judge of\r\nthe Audiencia of Valencia, found Bru, who was a familiar, a contumacious\r\nwitness. He was first given the town as a prison, then his house, and\r\nfinally was confined in chains. He appealed to the tribunal, which\r\nordered his release within three days, under pain of excommunication and\r\nfive hundred ducats. A competencia was formed which, in November, 1699,\r\nwas decided in favor of the royal jurisdiction. It was probably in\r\nconsequence of this discussion that, on July 15th, a royal decree was\r\nissued compelling familiars to give evidence in secular courts. Even\r\nthis did not abate the pretensions of the Inquisition for when, in 1702,\r\nJoseph Pérez of Montesa, a familiar, was ordered, under penalty of a\r\nthousand ducats, not to leave that town because a deposition was wanted\r\nfrom him, he appealed to the tribunal of Valencia which, with the usual\r\nthreats, commanded the revocation of the order. On this being refused,\r\nPérez went to Valencia and had himself incarcerated in the secret\r\nprison, where he was inaccessible. The Audiencia pursued the matter,\r\nthere was considerable correspondence and preparations for a\r\ncompetencia, but finally the affair was settled by sending Pérez to the\r\nhouse of the regent of the Audiencia, where he made his deposition. To\r\nthe end, however, the tribunal maintained the position that, if any\r\nconstraint was used, it would resist and protect the familiar unless a\r\ncompetencia decided to the contrary.[1184]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not the secular courts alone that had these perpetual conflicts\r\nwith the Inquisition. Like Ishmael, its hand was against every man and\r\nevery man's hand was against it--but, in fact, this was to a great\r\nextent the case between all the different jurisdictions among which the\r\nvarious classes of society were parcelled out by their several\r\nprivileges and exemptions. Next to the royal courts ranked the spiritual\r\ncourts in the number and complexity of debatable questions with the\r\nInquisition. With these there were two sources of contention, for they\r\nnot only claimed by prescriptive right exclusive jurisdiction in all\r\ntemporal matters over all who wore the tonsure, but there was a broad\r\nfield for discussion in the somewhat hazy delimitation of spiritual\r\noffences justiciable by one or the other. This latter subject will\r\nengage our attention hereafter; at present we are concerned only with\r\nthe questions arising from the personnel of the Holy Office. Notoriously\r\nlax as were the episcopal courts with offenders of the cloth, the\r\nInquisition had the reputation of still greater indulgence with those\r\nwho were under its protection; clerics who were also officials therefore\r\npreferred its tribunals, giving rise to frequent quarrels in which the\r\ninquisitors treated their clerical opponents as remorselessly as they\r\ndid the secular officials and judges. The episcopal Ordinaries,\r\nprovisors and vicars-general contended that they had, except in cases of\r\nfaith, exclusive jurisdiction over all clerics; that the temporal\r\njurisdiction of the Inquisition was a royal grant which could not\r\nsupersede the canon law and that the papal commissions only gave\r\nfaculties for punishing official malfeasance. To this unanswerable\r\nargument the inquisitors paid little heed and the prelates were worse\r\noff than the judges for these at least had the Councils of Castile or\r\nAragon to struggle for them, but the Councils admitted that they had no\r\nstanding in ecclesiastical quarrels. The natural recourse of the\r\nprelates for protection was to Rome, but this was a subject of intense\r\njealousy, traditional in the Spanish monarchy, and Philip III, in a\r\ncédula of January 21, 1611, addressed to all the prelates of his\r\ndominions, told them that they must appeal only to the Suprema and\r\nforbade them to carry any case to the Holy See.[1185]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SPIRITUAL COURTS_]\r\n\r\nThere could thus be no competencia; the conflicts between the two\r\njurisdictions were one-sided and were conducted by the tribunals with\r\nthe same overbearing arrogance as that displayed towards secular\r\nmagistrates. The first summons on the provisor or vicar-general\r\ninhibited him, under pain of excommunication and a heavy fine, from\r\nfurther action, ordering him, within twenty-four hours, to remit the\r\ncase to the Inquisition and to discharge the prisoner under bail to\r\npresent himself before the tribunal, while the notary was required to\r\nsurrender all the papers. If this was not obeyed, it was followed by\r\nanother, commanding obedience within six hours, in default of which all\r\nbeneficed priests were required, under similar penalties, to publish the\r\nprovisor and notary as excommunicates and to place their names on the\r\nlists as such. A circular letter was also addressed to all priests,\r\nchaplains and sacristans of the district, to admonish all persons,\r\nwithin six hours and under pain of excommunication, to avoid the\r\nprovisor and notary, to make no pleadings before them, to hold no\r\ncommunication with them and not to furnish them with bread or wine, fish\r\nor flesh, while a public edict to the same effect was issued to all the\r\npeople. In case of continued obduracy, these measures were promptly\r\nfollowed by an edict to all the clergy, ordering them to anathematize\r\nthe provisor and notary with tolling bells and extinguished candles,\r\nproclaiming them accursed of God and his saints--\"accursed be the bread\r\nthat they eat and the bed on which they sleep and the beasts on which\r\nthey ride, and may their souls perish in hell like the candles in the\r\nwater: let them be comprehended in the sentence of Sodom and Gomorrha\r\nand of Dathan and Abiram, whom the earth swallowed for disobedience, and\r\nmay all the curses of Psalm _Deus laudem meam_ (Ps. CVIII, a fearful\r\ncommination) light on them!\" If this did not suffice within twenty-four\r\nhours, an interdict followed, tolling bells and performing divine\r\nservice in low tone with locked doors, until otherwise ordered. In case\r\nthis failed, the last step was a _cessatio a divinis_, or cessation of\r\nchurch services in the city where the offenders lived, in order to\r\ncoerce them with popular clamor.[1186] It was difficult for either lay\r\nor clerical officials to contend with opponents who wielded such weapons\r\nas these.\r\n\r\nThe irresponsible exercise of such powers inevitably led to their abuse.\r\nIn the Concordia of 1568 it is highly suggestive to find a clause\r\nforbidding inquisitors to issue, as they have been accustomed, to\r\nfamiliars and officials, general inhibitions protecting them from the\r\necclesiastical courts; such inhibitions are to be special and issued\r\nonly in each case as it may occur. Equally significant is another which\r\nsays that in no case belonging by law to the provisor shall the\r\ninquisitor intervene against his will.[1187] The strained relations\r\nresulting between the ecclesiastical body and the Holy Office are\r\nalluded to in the project of reform, presented to the Suprema in 1623,\r\nwhich says that the clerical commissioners and their notaries bring\r\nabout many conflicts with the ecclesiastical judges and, as there are no\r\nConcordias, the inquisitors are wont to arrogate to themselves greater\r\njurisdiction than belongs to them, which causes much murmuring and\r\nresentment of the prelates and clergy. The writer piously wishes that\r\nthis could be avoided, but he evidently has no remedy to propose.[1188]\r\n\r\nA conflict caused by one of these local notaries in 1609 amply justified\r\nthe murmurs of the prelates. The priest of Cabra, who occupied the\r\nalmost nominal position of local notary, was a notorious incestuous\r\nconcubinarian, who had not for eight years celebrated mass or recited\r\nprayers. The provisor of Córdova commenced a prosecution and threw him\r\ninto the episcopal gaol, when he claimed the fuero of the Inquisition.\r\nThe provisor had been on friendly terms with the three inquisitors and\r\nsought an amicable settlement of the matter when, by a trick, they\r\nobtained possession of the papers and inhibited him from further\r\nproceedings. He appealed to the Suprema and was excommunicated. Four\r\ntimes the Suprema ordered the inquisitors to abandon the case and remove\r\nthe censure, but they persistently disobeyed. All the officials of the\r\nepiscopal court were ordered to hold no communication with him, which\r\nthrew the whole business of the diocese into confusion, for the bishop\r\nwas absent and the provisor was his representative. The culprit escaped\r\nfrom the episcopal gaol and was harbored by the tribunal. Passion was\r\nbecoming acute; a band of familiars and officials broke into the\r\nepiscopal palace and endeavored to carry off the provisor, but he was\r\nrescued by the canons in a dilapidated condition and took to his bed.\r\nThen the inquisitors pronounced the magic word--a matter of faith--which\r\nbrought to their aid the corregidor and municipal authorities, who came\r\nwith a troop of soldiers and carried him off on his bed, to the sound of\r\ndrums and trumpets. He was taken to the Inquisition and confined for two\r\nmonths in a small cell, tried without opportunity for defence and\r\nsentenced to forfeit his office of provisor, to four years of banishment\r\nand other penalties, and copies of the sentence were circulated\r\nthroughout the city. The bishop had sought to come to his rescue by\r\nexcommunicating the inquisitors; they disregarded the censures,\r\nthreatened to prosecute him if he did not remove them and did prosecute\r\nsome of the canons as conspiring against the Inquisition, because they\r\nhad been elected by the chapter to aid the bishop in defending the\r\nprovisor.[1189]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SPIRITUAL COURTS_]\r\n\r\nSuch a sentence against a church dignitary of high rank required\r\nconfirmation by the Suprema, which must have been given, for appeal was\r\nmade to Philip III. He rendered some satisfaction by dismissing and\r\nbanishing all secular officials who had been concerned in the arrest and\r\nwounding of the provisor, but the inquisitors, whose mere tools they had\r\nbeen, were left undisturbed.[1190] Yet it was impossible that an affair\r\nwhich had aroused the attention of all Spain should pass without an\r\nattempt to prevent the recurrence of such scandals. There had been a\r\nthreat, and possibly more than a threat, to appeal to Rome in defence of\r\nthe bishop and clergy of Córdova, which led to the cédula of January 21,\r\n1611, alluded to above, restricting their recourse to the Suprema. In\r\nurging this the Suprema, in a consulta of November 15, 1610, admitted\r\nthat these troubles arose from the aggressions of the tribunals and\r\ntheir unnecessary multiplication of nominal officials; it had recently\r\nissued three _cartas acordadas_ on the subject and had written to all\r\nthe bishops asking reports of such excesses so as to remedy them. Philip\r\nin reply authorized the Suprema to draft such a cédula as it desired but\r\nordered it to be so framed as not to encourage the inquisitors, who were\r\nevery day intervening in matters beyond their competence for the purpose\r\nof extending their jurisdiction; it was this that gave rise to these\r\ntroubles, nor would they cease till the cause was removed.[1191]\r\n\r\nThus it was admitted on all hands that the fault lay with the tribunals,\r\nyet the wrong committed by that of Córdova remained unredressed and\r\nunpunished. Philip permitted himself, in spite of his better judgement,\r\nto be persuaded to cut off all recourse to the court of last resort in\r\nRome, and some nominal relief must be offered to the oppressed churches\r\nand prelates. The memorial from Córdova had concluded with a prayer for\r\nsome law to prevent these discords and to maintain the episcopal\r\njurisdiction over the clergy, as the king had promised in a letter\r\ntransmitted through the Council of Castile. The promise was kept after a\r\nfashion, though not until after a delay which shows how prolonged was\r\nthe resistance encountered. In a carta acordada of November 28, 1612,\r\nthe tribunals were informed that in order that the ministers of the\r\nInquisition may not sin through confidence of impunity, and to prevent\r\nthe conflicts which disturb the peace, the Suprema has resolved that in\r\nthe cases of unsalaried clerical officials, the episcopal ordinaries\r\nshall have exclusive jurisdiction over offences relating to clerical\r\nduties and offices, to simony and spiritual matters, while inquisitors\r\nshall have cumulative jurisdiction with the ordinaries, depending on\r\npriority of action, in public and scandalous offences, such as\r\nincontinence, usury, gambling and the like.[1192] This remained in force\r\nnominally at least, until the last, but the allusion to the perpetual\r\ntroubles arising from this source, in the project presented to the\r\nSuprema in 1623, shows how futile it was in curbing the aggressions of\r\nthe tribunals.\r\n\r\nThroughout Peninsular Spain the episcopal jurisdiction was thus left\r\ndefenceless to the encroachments of the Inquisition, but the Church of\r\nMajorca was fortunate in obtaining the protection of Rome, leading to a\r\nseries of conflicts, waged on less unequal terms, which are worth\r\nconsideration as revealing a peculiar phase in these affairs. There was\r\na long-standing quarrel between the cathedral canons and the\r\nInquisition. In 1600, one of the former, Pere Enseñat, assisted in the\r\nescape of a man who had wounded a familiar, whereupon the inquisitor,\r\nFrancisco de Esquinel, threw him in prison and made him give bail in\r\nthree hundred ducats. In 1605, another canon, Francisco Sanceloni, had a\r\nverbal altercation with Bernardo Luis Cotoner, advocate of prisoners,\r\nfor which Esquinel imprisoned him, tried him and condemned him in the\r\ncosts, with his past incarceration as a punishment. The indignant canons\r\naddressed a strong remonstrance to the Suprema. They had an old\r\nprivilege, confirmed by the Council of Trent (Sess. XXV, De Reform. cap.\r\n6) that they could be arrested only by the Ordinary sitting in judgement\r\nwith two of their number; in matters of faith they admitted subjection\r\nto the Holy Office, but they claimed exemption in civil and criminal\r\ncases. The number of familiars and officials, and their petulance\r\narising from the protection of the tribunal, rendered it impossible to\r\nbe always incurring the expense and dangers of appeals to Rome for the\r\npreservation of their privileges. This was ineffective and, in the\r\ncourse of another outbreak in 1630, there was a correspondence between\r\nthe Congregation of the Roman Inquisition and the nuncio at Madrid\r\nrespecting an appeal from the canons. In this the nuncio reported that\r\nhe had applied to Inquisitor-general Zapata, who promised to instruct\r\nthe inquisitor not to molest the canons.[1193]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SPIRITUAL COURTS_]\r\n\r\nIf he did so, he was disobeyed as usual and, in 1636, a canon named\r\nDomenge was involved in a civil suit before the tribunal, resulting in a\r\njudgement against him of five thousand reales, the execution of which he\r\nresisted by force. This brought on him a prosecution, in spite of\r\nprotests interjected by the bishop and chapter, which was carried on\r\nappeal to the Suprema, where he was condemned in seven hundred reales\r\nwhich he paid. Meanwhile, notwithstanding the cédula of 1611, the bishop\r\nand chapter had applied to Rome for a brief declaring that the canons\r\nwere subject to the Inquisition only in matters of faith. The question\r\nwas exhaustively discussed, in the Congregation of the Holy Office, with\r\nLuis de los Infantes, the Roman agent of the Inquisition. The conclusion\r\nreached was that the Majorca tribunal had no jurisdiction over the\r\ncanons save in matters of faith and this was duly embodied in the brief\r\n_Cum sicut dilecti_, March 31, 1642, which is preserved in the\r\nBullarium. It names the bishop and dean or treasurer as executors, with\r\npower to inflict censures and to invoke if necessary the aid of the\r\nsecular arm. It was received in Majorca with general rejoicing; it was\r\nprinted and circulated and a syndicate was formed by the clergy to\r\nobtain, without regard to expense, a similar one for the whole\r\necclesiastical body, an effort which was successful in the following\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nThe brief was duly served on the inquisitor, who refused to recognize it\r\nas not having been transmitted through the Suprema; besides he asserted\r\nthat it was surreptitious and obreptitious as having been granted\r\nwithout a hearing of the other side and moreover it was in derogation of\r\nthe bull _Si de protegendis_. In a consulta of December 11th, the\r\nSuprema represented energetically to Philip IV the manner in which his\r\npredecessors had compelled the surrender of papal letters adverse to the\r\nInquisition; it asked him to have the present one suppressed and to\r\ninstruct the prelates that all cases of difference must be referred to\r\nit, that no recourse be had to Rome, under the penalties decreed by\r\nFerdinand, that the Viceroy of Majorca be required to compel the chapter\r\nto desist and that the ambassador to Rome be instructed to obtain the\r\nrevocation of the obnoxious letters.\r\n\r\nUnluckily for the Suprema the times were unpropitious. Majorca was too\r\nnear to rebellious Catalonia for the imperious methods of the Holy\r\nOffice to be judicious. Philip replied that the revival of Ferdinand's\r\nlaws would cause trouble and the remedy sought must be practicable. The\r\ninquisitor of Majorca had been guilty of gross excesses and must be\r\nordered to exercise moderation, and he suggested a junta of members of\r\nthe Suprema and Council of Aragon to devise a Concordia. Whether such\r\ncompromise was reached does not appear; if it was, subsequent events\r\nshow that it was not observed by either side and no reference to it\r\noccurs. The papal briefs were maintained and ten years later, after the\r\ncollapse of the Catalan rebellion, instructions of April 23, 1652, to an\r\nambassador departing for Rome, order him to labor for their revocation;\r\ntheir evil example was contagious; the Knights of St. John in Majorca\r\nwere seeking to obtain a similar favor through the Maltese ambassador,\r\nwhich must be resisted in every way, for it would be followed by all the\r\nother Orders.[1194]\r\n\r\nThe Suprema continued to treat the papal briefs as surreptitious and, in\r\n1658, Arce y Reynoso enjoyed a momentary triumph in a contest by\r\nsummoning the vicar-general to Madrid and forcing him to come.[1195]\r\nUnder the feebler government of the queen-regent, his successor Nithard\r\nwas not so fortunate, in a fierce quarrel which involved the whole\r\nisland in confusion and embroiled the rival departments of the\r\ngovernment. May 9, 1667, on a feast-day, in the church of San Francisco,\r\nDon Jorje Dameto struck his son-in-law, Don Joseph Vallejo, with a\r\ncrutch, causing effusion of blood and thus polluting the church. Both\r\ngentlemen were familiars. The inquisitor, before noon-day, ordered the\r\narrest of both; in the afternoon Bishop Manjarre cited Dameto to appear\r\nfor sacrilege and violation of the church. The rival jurisdictions\r\nlocked horns and proceeded to extremities. The viceroy and Audiencia,\r\nwith the bulk of the community, sided with the bishop, but disturbances\r\nwere commencing and they repeatedly urged postponement of action until\r\nthe government could be heard from, but the inquisitor refused. The\r\nbishop published him as excommunicate, anathematized him and caused the\r\npsalm of malediction to be repeatedly sung against him, but the\r\ninquisitor continued to celebrate mass, exhibited himself conspicuously\r\nin public, forbade the bishop entrance into his own church and\r\nthreatened to suspend his sacerdotal functions. On August 29th the\r\nbishop assembled a synod where arrangements were made to send an envoy\r\nto Rome to prosecute the case, with a printed statement of all the\r\nproceedings, a copy of which was furnished to the Council of Aragon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SPIRITUAL COURTS_]\r\n\r\nFrom Madrid, Nithard imperiously summoned the bishop to appear before\r\nhim and plead his case. Under the canon law, the Inquisition had no\r\njurisdiction over bishops, without a special delegation of papal\r\nfaculties, and Manjarre was justified in declaring the summons null and\r\nvoid. Although, as an ecclesiastical question, the Council of Aragon had\r\nno direct competence, still as the peace of Majorca was seriously\r\nthreatened and the viceroy was involved, it took a hand in the matter\r\nand thus were presented the gravest questions with regard to the\r\nrelations of the Inquisition with the episcopate, with the Holy See, and\r\nwith the secular authorities.\r\n\r\nSecure in the blind obedience of the queen, Nithard adopted the most\r\naggressive attitude, and the queen submissively did whatever he\r\nrequired, for he assured her that the case was the most serious that had\r\narisen since the foundation of the Inquisition and that, on its rightful\r\ndecision, depended the preservation or extinction, not alone of the\r\nMajorca tribunal, but of all those under the crown of Aragon. To\r\nemphasize this he summoned the bishop to appear before him, personally\r\nor by procurator, within a term designated, in default of which he would\r\nbe prosecuted _in contumacia_. To this the queen, in October, added her\r\ncommands to the Council of Aragon; as the preservation of the Catholic\r\nfaith required the maintenance of the authority of the Inquisition, the\r\nCouncil was ordered to write to the bishop to comply with the summons,\r\nand to the viceroy to assist the tribunal if necessary; the bishop must\r\nnot appeal to Rome and if he had done so the letters must be intercepted\r\nand placed in her hands.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Aragon did not obey. It held the matter until January 21,\r\n1668, when it presented a consulta warning the queen of the consequences\r\nof her action and pointing out that the pope was the sole judge of\r\nbishops in important cases, as were provincial synods in trivial\r\nmatters. Nithard, however, was superior to the Council of Trent, and the\r\nSuprema commenced a criminal prosecution of Bishop Manjarre, while, on\r\nFebruary 5th, an answer was prepared for the Council of Aragon, couched\r\nin a tone of bitterness and scarcely veiled contempt, which showed how\r\nfierce were the passions at work. The queen was assured that her action\r\nwas in accordance with all previous royal provisions and she was asked\r\nto order the Council of Aragon to obey and not to interfere hereafter\r\nwith ecclesiastical controversies. Before this missive was delivered,\r\nhowever, news came from Majorca that the culprit Dameto had withdrawn\r\nhis appeal to the tribunal and had applied for absolution to the bishop,\r\nwho considered the whole matter as settled. This was a staggering blow\r\nfrom which it took Nithard a month to recover, but finally he sent the\r\nconsulta of February 5th with a postscript of March 12th, arguing that a\r\nsubject cannot impair his judge's jurisdiction by accepting another and\r\nconsequently that the situation was unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe queen of course adopted this view and repeated her orders, but again\r\nthe Council disobeyed her and presented, March 18th, a consulta adjuring\r\nher in solemn terms to reflect calmly, for she was making the\r\ninquisitor-general a judge of all the bishops in her dominions, not only\r\nas to conflicts of jurisdiction but also as to criminal accusations,\r\nwithout his holding faculties from the pope, while, at the same time,\r\nshe was forbidding appeals to the Holy See which was the only proper\r\njudge. She was warned that it was impossible to exaggerate the\r\nimportance of the questions at issue and she was implored, before making\r\nso momentous a decision, to consult the Councils of Castile, Italy and\r\nthe Indies, for the interests of the whole monarchy were involved as\r\nwell as the supreme power of the pope. To this her reply was merely a\r\nrepetition of her former orders and a demand for a duplicate of the\r\nletters of the Council to the Viceroy. For the third time it disobeyed\r\nher and sent none and there are intimations that it was engaged in\r\narousing the whole Spanish episcopate to a sense of the impending\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThen the affair suddenly assumed another phase. On March 7th the queen\r\nhad written to her ambassador in Rome to procure the abstention of the\r\npope from the matter, but, on that very day, the Congregation of the\r\nInquisition, with the approval of the pope, had pronounced invalid the\r\ncensures fulminated by the inquisitor. It was late in May before this\r\nwas communicated to the queen by the nuncio, who said that the pope had\r\nrecognized the gravity of the assault by an inquisitor on the episcopal\r\ndignity and the magnitude of the ensuing scandal, and had caused the\r\nwhole subject to be carefully considered by the Congregation with the\r\nabove result. The pope had felt deeply, not only the indignity offered\r\nto the episcopal office, but also that the fiscal of the Inquisition had\r\napplied to the queen to summon the bishop before it, solely on the\r\nground of his having appealed to the Holy See. In the name of the pope\r\nthe nuncio therefore asked the queen to order inquisitors not to proceed\r\nagainst bishops and to reject the application of the fiscal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE SPIRITUAL COURTS_]\r\n\r\nEven this did not shake the determination of Nithard to reduce the\r\nepiscopate to subjection. A long and argumentative consulta was\r\npresented to the queen, proving that the papal decision was\r\nsurreptitious and therefore invalid, and that anyhow the decrees of the\r\nRoman Inquisition had no currency in Spain. The old prohibitions of\r\nappeals to Rome were invoked and the queen was told that one of the most\r\nprecious jewels of the Spanish crown was at stake, for, unless the\r\nregalías were preserved, the Inquisition must disappear, delinquents\r\nwould be unpunished, religion would suffer and, with the loss of its\r\nunity, there would no longer be obedience to the throne. The queen was\r\ntherefore urged to stand firm; the prosecution of the bishop must not be\r\nsuspended and the Council of Aragon must be forced to obey the royal\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nNithard was ready to risk an open breach with the Holy See in his\r\naudacious ambition to render the Inquisition supreme in the Spanish\r\nChurch. How far the queen would have suffered herself to be carried in\r\nthe execution of his plans cannot be told, as the documents fail us\r\nhere. His career, however, was drawing to a close. In February, 1669, he\r\nwas driven from Spain amid universal execration, yet the prosecution of\r\nBishop Manjarre was not abandoned, for the Inquisition was not\r\naccustomed openly to admit defeat. It dragged until his death, December\r\n26, 1670, when it was quietly dropped.[1196]\r\n\r\nPractically the intervention of Rome gave the victory to the\r\nMallorquins, of which they took advantage. In 1671 there arose another\r\nquarrel over a fine incurred by a canon who was also a consultor of the\r\ntribunal. Both sides exchanged excommunications and Inquisitor-general\r\nValladares, profiting by his predecessor's experience, showed\r\nmoderation. On the plea that it was a matter of government rather than\r\nof jurisdiction, the Suprema ordered the tribunal to abandon the case\r\nand remove the censures imposed on the canons, but the latter were not\r\ncontent with this and procured from the Roman Holy Office a decree\r\ndeclaring invalid the censures of the inquisitors and valid those of the\r\nexecutors of the brief. The Council of Aragon communicated this to the\r\nqueen who submissively signed a letter, January 25, 1672, to the\r\nchapter, expressing her confidence that in its use they would pay\r\nfitting attention to the peace and advantage of the Church.[1197]\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition was not accustomed to defeat and it chafed under this,\r\nas was shown when, in 1690, a quarrel arose because a priest of\r\nMinorca, named Juan Bruells, used insulting words to the commissioner,\r\nRafael Pons. For this he was prosecuted and the case threw all the\r\nislands into confusion. The viceroy, the Audiencia and the clergy all\r\nunited against the Inquisition. The Ordinary of Minorca, as executor of\r\nthe brief of 1642, forcibly released Bruells, forbade the inquisitor to\r\nproceed and, on his disobeying, excommunicated him. About this time the\r\nMallorquin tribunal had claims to consideration arising from its\r\nvigorous proceedings against Judaizers and the large resultant\r\nconfiscations. The Suprema espoused its cause with the usual energy and,\r\nin repeated consultas to Carlos III, denounced the papal briefs as\r\nsurreptitious and invalid, full of defects and nullities. The feeble\r\nking issued repeated commands for the prosecution of Bruells and the\r\nsurrender of the briefs, but no one paid attention to them. The\r\nMallorquin clergy procured from the Congregation of the Inquisition a\r\ndecree validating the censures pronounced by the Ordinary and annulling\r\nthose of the inquisitor; the pope confirmed this but subsequently\r\nsuspended it at the earnest solicitation of the Spanish ambassador, at\r\nthe same time ordering his nuncio to make the king understand that the\r\nCongregation had supreme power to decide all questions of jurisdiction.\r\nThe affair did not result to the satisfaction of the Inquisition for the\r\nlast we hear of it is a bitter complaint by the Suprema, March 11, 1693,\r\nof the contumacious Mallorquins and the miserable condition to which\r\nthey had reduced the Inquisition. In Minorca, the clergy and their\r\ndependents were so hostile that Pons could not find a church in which to\r\ncelebrate mass, while the officials were shunned as excommunicated\r\nheretics.[1198]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MILITARY ORDERS_]\r\n\r\nAnother jurisdiction with which there were occasional quarrels was that\r\nof the army, for soldiers were exempt from the secular courts. In such\r\ncompetencias settlements were made by a junta of two members each of the\r\nSuprema and the Council of War, with final reference to the king in case\r\nof disagreement. I have happened to meet with but few cases of this and\r\nthey seem never to have attained the importance of those with the\r\nsecular and ecclesiastical courts. One occurred in 1629, arising from\r\ndisputes with the garrison that had occupied the Aljafería since the\r\ntroubles of 1591. A somewhat curious case was that of Don Fernando\r\nAntonio Herrera Calderon, of Santander, who was alguazil and familiar\r\nand who resigned, in 1641, from his military company, although warned\r\nthat, by so doing during hostilities, he would be tried by the Council\r\nof War. It naturally claimed him and the Suprema endeavored to protect\r\nhim.[1199] It would seem that, towards the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the exemption of the military was causing special troubles, for\r\na royal cédula of February 9, 1793, declares that, to put an end to\r\nthem, in future the military judges shall have exclusive cognizance of\r\nall cases, civil and criminal, in which soldiers are defendants, except\r\ninheritances, and that no tribunal or judge of any kind shall form a\r\ncompetencia concerning them under any pretext.[1200]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was yet another independent jurisdiction with which the\r\nInquisition occasionally came into collision. In Spain the Military\r\nOrders formed so important a body that, among the State Councils, there\r\nwas one of Orders, which had exclusive jurisdiction over their members.\r\nIt will be recalled that one of Ferdinand's most efficient measures to\r\nensure the peace of the kingdom was to obtain the perpetual\r\nadministration of those of Santiago, Calatrava and Alcántara, while the\r\nqueen assumed that of Montesa. Yet he was not disposed to favor their\r\nclaims of exemption in temporal matters from the jurisdiction of the\r\nInquisition. A letter of September 15, 1515, to the tribunal of Jaen,\r\nsays that certain confiscations involve property held by knights of the\r\nthree Orders who may claim exemption and refuse to plead before the\r\njudge of confiscations; if so they are not to be listened to and, if\r\nnecessary, are to be prosecuted with the full rigor of the law.[1201]\r\n\r\nIn civil and criminal matters the members of the Orders asserted\r\nexemption from the jurisdiction of the Inquisition, leading to disputes\r\nmore or less acrimonious. In 1609, at Córdova, Don Diego de Argoté, a\r\nKnight of Santiago, with levelled pistol, prevented the arrest of one of\r\nhis servants by officials of the tribunal. A competencia resulted which,\r\nwhen carried up to Philip III, was decided by him in favor of the\r\nCouncil of Orders. To this the Suprema replied in a consulta, fortelling\r\nthe entire destruction of the Inquisition in case the decision was\r\nallowed to stand and so worked on Philip that he reversed his decree\r\nand allowed the Suprema to prosecute the culprit.[1202] The\r\ncomplication caused by these class privileges is illustrated in the case\r\nalluded to above, occurring in 1648, at Cuenca, of Muñoz de\r\nCastilblanque for the murder of the priest Jacinto. He was a Knight of\r\nCalatrava which led to an additional competencia, when the junta could\r\nnot agree and the king had to decide.[1203]\r\n\r\nIn their contests with the Orders, the tribunals were apt to exhibit the\r\nsame unscrupulous spirit as in those with other contestants. In Majorca\r\nDoctor Ramon Sureda, canon, chancellor and judge of competencias, was\r\nlikewise conservator of the Military Orders. In 1657 he complained that,\r\nin conflicts of jurisdiction, the inquisitor would not form competencias\r\nwith him in order that the papers might take the regular course of\r\ntransmission for settlement by the Suprema and Council of Orders. The\r\nking and queen therefore, as administrators of the Orders, instructed\r\nhim in such case to send to the inquisitor three successive messages and\r\nreport them and their replies to the Council; if, in spite of this, the\r\ntribunal continued to prosecute the case, he was to proceed against the\r\ninquisitor and the viceroy was to render him all proper support. The\r\ninquisitor ingeniously evaded this in the case of Gaspar Puygdorfilio, a\r\nKnight of Santiago, in 1661, by refusing to receive any messages, saying\r\nthat he received them only from the viceroy. Sureda's report of this was\r\nleft unnoticed and the inquisitor adopted the same device, in 1662, in\r\nthe case of Francisco de Veri, a Knight of Montesa, prosecuted for\r\nwounding a familiar who had drawn a sword upon him. He refused to\r\nreceive messages and proceeded to sequestrate Veri's property, including\r\nhis crops and cattle. To save them from destruction the viceroy\r\ninterposed and the Council of Orders appealed to the queen, as\r\nadministrator of the Order, to take some action that should enable such\r\nquestions to be settled peaceably, but apparently without result.[1204]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MILITARY ORDERS_]\r\n\r\nAs though the exempted classes were not numerous and troublesome enough,\r\nthere was a project, in 1574, of adding another which, if carried into\r\neffect, would have altered the destiny of Spain by subjecting it\r\neventually to the Inquisition and reducing the nominal monarch to the\r\nposition of a _roi fainéant_ under a Mayor of the Palace. It is a most\r\nimpressive illustration of the spirit of the age that such a project\r\nshould have been formulated, that it received enthusiastic support and\r\nthat a sovereign so jealous of his prerogative as Philip II should have\r\neven allowed it to be debated, much less have let it assume a menacing\r\nshape and have given it serious consideration. A Military Order was to\r\nbe established under the name of _Santa María de la Espada Blanca_, with\r\na white sword as a symbol, like the red sword of Santiago. At its head\r\nwas to be the inquisitor-general, to whom all members were to swear\r\nallegiance and whose orders in peace and war all were to obey. To him\r\nlikewise they were to assign their property, receiving back at his hands\r\nwhat was necessary for their support, and after death their widows were\r\nto be pensioned by him. They were to be exempt from all jurisdiction\r\nsave his, which was to be delegated to priors appointed in all the\r\nprovinces. The ostensible object was the defence of the faith and of\r\nSpain, for which they were at any time liable to be called to the field,\r\nor to serve in garrison, under the orders of the inquisitor-general.\r\nThus the Inquisition was to be furnished with an organized force, sworn\r\nto blind obedience and released from all other obligations. The only\r\nrequisite for membership was _limpieza_, or purity of blood, free from\r\nall taint of Judaic or Moorish contamination, or descent from those who\r\nhad been sentenced for heresy. At this period limpieza was becoming a\r\npopular mania; the cost of proving it through four generations was\r\nconsiderable, and there was strong temptation in the promise that the\r\nexpenses of all applicants would be defrayed from the common fund.\r\n\r\nThe project may seem to us too wild to merit a thought, but it responded\r\nso perfectly to the temper of the time that it was enthusiastically\r\nadopted by the provinces of Castile, Leon, Biscay, Navarre, Aragon,\r\nValencia, Catalonia, Asturias and Galicia. Procurators from these\r\nprovinces submitted it to Philip for his approval and were supported by\r\nrepresentatives of forty-eight noble houses and of the archiepiscopal\r\nsees of Toledo, Santiago, Seville, Saragossa, Valencia, Tarragona and\r\nGranada. It was debated earnestly and at much length, but the argument\r\nof Pedro Vinegas de Córdova decided its fate. He pointed out the\r\ntroubles which were already arising on the subject of limpieza, causing\r\njealousies, hatreds and contentions, to be increased enormously if the\r\npopulation was thus to be divided into two classes; also the fact that\r\nthe royal courts would have left to their jurisdiction only the New\r\nChristians, while the Old Christians would have their special judges\r\nand, if the comparatively few existing familiars caused such\r\nall-pervading troubles, what the effect would be of increasing without\r\nlimit the number of the exempt. On the one hand the ambitious and able\r\nmen among the New Christians, being thus cast out, would foment\r\ndisaffection and disturbance; on the other, if the old Military Orders\r\nhad been a source of danger to the monarchy, what would be the effect of\r\ncreating a new one, united and vastly more numerous and subject as\r\nvassals to an inquisitor-general, whose power was already so great, and\r\nwho would control the property and have jurisdiction over all members,\r\nwhile in case of rebellion the frontiers and strongholds would be in his\r\nhands? This reasoning was unanswerable; Philip ordered all papers\r\nconnected with the project to be surrendered; he imposed perpetual\r\nsilence on its advocates and wrote to the ecclesiastical and secular\r\nbodies to abandon it, for justice and protection would never be\r\nlacking.[1205]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall probably do no injustice to the Inquisition in attributing to\r\nthe profits accruing from the exercise of its temporal jurisdiction the\r\nruthless vigor with which the tribunals sought to vindicate and extend\r\nit. The remarks of the Visitor Cervantes with regard to Barcelona, in\r\n1561 (p. 468), indicate how lucrative it could be made and how welcome\r\nwas the addition of fees and fines to the somewhat meagre salaries of\r\nthe officials. This explains the reckless violence which became habitual\r\nin the conduct of quarrels, because this not only was an assurance to\r\nthe parties concerned as to the vigor with which they were defended, but\r\nit also served to discourage the secular authorities from resisting\r\nencroachments. It also explains the multiplication of the unsalaried\r\nofficials such as familiars, commissioners and their notaries,\r\nassessors, deputies etc., which no laws or Concordias or regulations\r\ncould restrain, for each one was a possible source of profit to the\r\ntribunal and a probable cause of disturbance in his vicinage, through\r\nthe comfortable assurance of immunity from the law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EVILS OF THE SYSTEM_]\r\n\r\nThe natural result of this was that unprofitable business was neglected\r\nfor profitable, and the suppression of heresy was postponed to the trial\r\nof civil and criminal cases which yielded fees. We have seen how\r\nCervantes reported that in Barcelona this seemed to be the real duty of\r\nthe tribunal and that there was nothing else to be attended to; his\r\nanimadversions produced no amendment and, in 1567, de Soto Salazar\r\nrepeated the complaint.[1206] This continued unchecked. The project of\r\nreform presented to the Suprema, in 1623, expresses the wish that other\r\ntribunals would follow the example of Saragossa, where one of the\r\ninquisitors was delegated every four months to conduct this business, so\r\nthat prisoners on trial for heresy could have their cases despatched and\r\nnot be kept languishing interminably in prison, which, as we shall see,\r\nwas one of the sorest abuses inflicted on them.[1207] This pious wish\r\nwas fruitless and the records of the Inquisition for the following\r\ncentury show how large a portion of its activity was devoted to these\r\ncases and to the competencias incessantly springing from them.\r\n\r\nOne feature which aggravated the oppression in these matters, especially\r\nin civil suits, was not only the favoritism which inevitably inclined\r\nthe tribunal to the side of its own people, but the fact that the\r\ninquisitors were usually strangers, unfamiliar with the local laws and\r\ncustoms peculiar to each province, which they presumed to interpret and\r\nenforce. This justified the frequent demands that inquisitors should be\r\nnatives--demands which received no attention, for the appointing power\r\nthought only of their qualifications as judges of the faith while, to\r\nthe mass of the population, their duties in this respect were of small\r\naccount in comparison with their activity in their temporal\r\njurisdiction. Another well-grounded source of complaint was that the\r\ninquisitorial habits of secrecy could not be wholly overcome; the\r\nparties and their counsel were not allowed to be present, as in the\r\nroyal courts; witnesses were examined by the inquisitor on lists of\r\ninterrogatories furnished to him, and there was no cross-examination;\r\nwritten arguments were presented to him which he handed to the other\r\nside for reply and the procedure, in both civil and criminal cases, was\r\nassimilated as nearly as might be to the secret trials for heresy which\r\nwas the inquisitorial ideal of the dispensation of justice. The cases\r\nwere decided by the inquisitors in session together, on a majority vote.\r\nIn the sixteenth century there was no appeal to the Suprema, even when\r\nthe vote was not unanimous, but, in 1645, a writer assumes that either\r\nside could appeal.[1208]\r\n\r\nWe have seen how tenaciously the kingdoms of Aragon struggled against\r\nthe evils of the system. Castile felt them equally but it had not the\r\nsame institutions and could only remonstrate. The Córtes of Madrid, in\r\n1607-8, represented that those of 1579 and 1586 had petitioned for the\r\nreform of the abuses arising from the temporal jurisdiction of the\r\nInquisition to the great injury of the kingdom; that Philip II had\r\npromised relief, but had died without granting it, and therefore the\r\nrequest was now repeated in view of the increasing evils. Especially was\r\nattention called to the cruelty of imprisoning ordinary offenders, for\r\nthe people could not distinguish and imagined all prisoners to be\r\nheretics, thus entailing infamy upon them and disqualifying them for\r\nmarriage, wherefore it was asked that they be confined in the public\r\ngaols. Philip III promised to do what was proper and of course did\r\nnothing. The Córtes of 1611 repeated the petition, with similar lack of\r\nresult.[1209]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EVILS OF THE SYSTEM_]\r\n\r\nThe Council of Castile, the highest tribunal in the land, in a consulta\r\nof 1631, represented forcibly the existing evils, especially the\r\nprodigal use of censures under which corregidores and other magistrates\r\nlay under excommunication for months together, while individuals were\r\nimpoverished by the long delays in settling competencias. It urged the\r\nremedy of permitting appeals to the Council _por via de fuerza_, in\r\ncases not of faith and this it repeated in 1634, 1669 and 1682.[1210]\r\nMore outspoken was a memorial presented, in 1648, to Philip by a member\r\nof the Council, on the abuses of the criminal jurisdiction, those in\r\ncivil cases being treated in a separate paper. The writer alludes to\r\nhaving repeatedly made the same representations orally and in writing;\r\nhe dwells upon the interminable delays and other obstacles which impede\r\njustice and discourage sufferers from seeking it. The resultant immunity\r\ncreates audacious criminals; the number of familiars and of soldiers who\r\nnever serve in the field has increased so greatly that nothing is seen\r\nbut crimes and the offenders are unpunished. Everywhere men of the most\r\ndissolute type and the largest fortunes seek appointment so as to enjoy\r\nimmunity; the royal revenues are defrauded and prohibited goods are\r\nimported, while no corregidor or alcalde dares to curb them, for they\r\nare at once excommunicated by the inquisitors, even to casting\r\ninterdicts over whole communities. Those who suffer remain without\r\nredress, so that those who are able are led to take it into their own\r\nhands, for they can get it nowhere else. Justice is trampled under foot;\r\nthere is no alguazil who dares to make an arrest, or scrivener to draw\r\nup papers, so many have been slain or wounded for so doing and the death\r\nof an alguazil is held at naught, as though the officers of justice were\r\ncommon enemies. If the king would re-establish the jurisdiction of the\r\nroyal courts there would be an end to the excommunications with which\r\nthe inquisitors defend their delinquents, as though they were vessels of\r\nthe Temple; the time of the Councils and of the king would not be\r\nconsumed by these perpetual competencias and the plagues would cease\r\nwherewith God afflicts these kingdoms for the injustice, the violence\r\nand the dissolute life of the people.[1211]\r\n\r\nThese warnings and remonstrances fell on deaf ears. The Suprema was\r\nskilled to work upon the piety of the king, and to promise him relief\r\nfrom perils if he would placate God by increasing the privileges of the\r\nInquisition, the very existence of which depended upon its ability to\r\nprotect its familiars from the law and from the universal hatred in\r\nwhich they were held.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Inquisitor-general Nithard, there was a bustling\r\nattempt to check the enormous evils admitted to exist. In 1677 Carlos II\r\ndeprecated the abuses common, both in excessive charges and in forcing\r\nhis pious subjects to submit by censures which deprived them of the\r\nconsolations of religion. He declared excommunication to be illegal in\r\nmatters connected exclusively with laymen and temporal possessions, and\r\nforbade its employment, a command which he addressed to the Suprema in\r\n1678 with directions to enforce it and which he repeated in 1691, but\r\nwithout effect.[1212] Then a more comprehensive effort was made to\r\neffect a radical reform. In 1696, Carlos was induced to assemble what\r\nwas known as the Junta Magna, consisting of two members each of the\r\nCouncils of State, of Aragon, of Castile, of Italy, of Indies and of\r\nOrders. The decree creating it recites the disturbance and interference\r\nwith justice, the continual collisions and competencias between the\r\nInquisition and the courts over question of jurisdiction and privileges,\r\nand the necessity of establishing some fixed principles and rules to\r\navert these troubles for the future and to preserve the Holy Office in\r\nthe love and reverence of the people, without its interfering in matters\r\nforeign to its venerable purpose. The Junta was to meet at least once a\r\nweek and it was furnished with materials from the records of all the\r\nCouncils, through which it obtained a thorough insight into the evils to\r\nbe remedied. These labors resulted in a memorial known as the Consulta\r\nMagna, drawn up by Doctor Joseph de Ledesma of the Council of Castile.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EVILS OF THE SYSTEM_]\r\n\r\nIt constituted a terrible indictment of the abuse, by the Inquisition,\r\nof the temporal jurisdiction bestowed on it by the sovereigns, with\r\nample proof of flagrant cases and incidents. Then followed a\r\nconsideration of possible remedies, of which the most indispensable was\r\ndeclared to be the prohibition of censures, which were so formidable\r\nthat no one could resist them. Persons arrested for offences not of\r\nfaith should be confined in the royal prisons to save them from the\r\nindelible disgrace of the secret prison. The _recurso de fuerza_ should\r\nbe admitted when excommunication was used in temporal cases. The _fuero_\r\nshould be withdrawn from the servants and commensals of officials whose\r\ninsolence gave occasion to arrests and censures causing dissensions that\r\nscandalized the whole kingdom. It was admitted that familiars now gave\r\nlittle trouble, save in Majorca, where there was no Concordia, but the\r\nsalaried officials were the source of infinite contention and they\r\nshould be put on the footing of familiars. A grievance of the greatest\r\nmagnitude was the interminable delay in the settlement of competencias,\r\nduring which prisoners languished in confinement and excommunicates\r\ncould not obtain absolution; this could be averted if the Concordias and\r\nroyal orders were enforced. As all attempts to curb the Inquisition had\r\nproved useless, and in spite of them it had continually increased its\r\nabuses, the ultimate remedy of depriving it wholly of the royal\r\njurisdiction might be found necessary, but meanwhile these milder\r\nmeasures might be tried in hope of relief.[1213] These proposed\r\nremedies, it will be seen, were moderate enough and in no way limited\r\nthe Inquisition in its ostensible functions as the preserver of the\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThis was the most formidable assault that the Inquisition had\r\nexperienced, coming as it did from the combined forces of all the other\r\norganizations of the State, under the auspices of the king, but it was\r\neasily averted. Llorente tells us that Inquisitor-general Rocaberti,\r\nworking through the royal confessor Froilan Diaz, who was ex-officio a\r\nmember of the Suprema, and also Rocaberti's subject in the Dominican\r\nOrder, succeeded in inducing Carlos to consign the consulta to the limbo\r\nin which reposed so many previous memorials.[1214] The manner in which\r\nthis was effected was simple enough. In 1726 Don Santiago Augustin Riol\r\ndrew up for Philip V a report on the creation and organization of the\r\nstate councils, in which he states that the consulta was submitted to\r\nthe Council of Castile for its action; this was delayed by the illness\r\nof the governor of the Council; when he returned to duty the matter was\r\nforgotten and the consulta disappeared so completely that, when Philip V\r\ncalled for it, in 1701, no copy could be found in the archives, as\r\nappeared from a certificate furnished by the archivist.[1215]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis narrow escape did not teach moderation. In 1702 the Valencia\r\ntribunal refused even to join in a competencia over a case in which it\r\nentertained a suit brought to collect the interest on a censo, by the\r\nwidow of an alguazil mayor as guardian of her children. It was in vain\r\nthat the regent of the Audiencia pointed out that, under the Concordia\r\nof 1568, the widow of an official only enjoyed the fuero as defendant\r\nand not as plaintiff and that the children had no claim whatever, and\r\ncited precedents that had been so decided; the tribunal was stubborn and\r\nwould not even admit that the question could be carried up to the\r\nSuprema and Council of Aragon for decision.[1216] It was not long after\r\nthis, however, that the Suprema was obliged to admit that reforms in the\r\nmethods of the Holy Office were essential. In its carta acordada of June\r\n27, 1705, is embodied a rebuke of the recklessness with which the\r\ntribunals undertook the defence of their officials, resulting in the\r\nuniversal complaints of the abuse of its jurisdiction, so that it was\r\npopularly said that everything was made a _caso de Inquisicion_, to the\r\ndisrepute of its officials and their families. Therefore, unless the\r\njurisdiction was indisputable, the Suprema must be consulted before\r\nassuming the defence, amicable adjustments must always be sought and\r\nfriendly relations be maintained with the royal officials, thus avoiding\r\ncompetencias which ordinarily arose from passionate conflicts over\r\ntrifles.[1217]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CURTAILMENT OF PRIVILEGES_]\r\n\r\nThese were wise admonitions to which as usual scant attention was paid,\r\nbut in time the tribunals were made to recognize the change which had\r\ncome in with the Bourbons. There was a highly illustrative case in 1720,\r\nat Toledo, where Don Pedro Paniagua, contador or auditor of the\r\ntribunal, received in October twenty sacks of cocoa from Cadiz. In the\r\nintricate details of the Spanish system of internal imposts, it would be\r\nimpossible now to say whether he had observed the formalities requisite\r\nin the transmission of merchandise, but the local authorities assumed\r\nthat there was a violation of law and also an infraction of quarantine,\r\nimposed in August, owing to an epidemic in Marseilles. The corregidor\r\nwas prompt; at 2 A.M. of the day following the arrival of the cocoa, he\r\nsearched Paniagua's country house and at 9 A.M. his town house and\r\nsequestrated the cocoa. The inquisitors responded by imprisoning the\r\ncivic guards who had been employed. A fortnight later, another visit\r\npaid to Paniagua's house showed that five sacks of the sequestrated\r\narticle had been removed, whereupon he was confined in the royal prison.\r\nThen the inquisitors proceeded against the corregidor and alcalde mayor\r\nwith censures, and aggravated them so energetically that in twenty-four\r\nhours they had an interdict and _cessatio a divinis_ in four parishes of\r\nthe city. These active demonstrations, however suited to the seventeenth\r\ncentury, were out of place in the eighteenth. As soon as news of them\r\nreached Madrid, hurried orders were despatched by the Suprema to remove\r\nthe interdict, absolve the officials and release the guards, and when\r\nthe formal report came from the tribunal the orders were repeated, with\r\nthe addition that the senior inquisitor should start for Madrid within\r\ntwenty-four hours. Prior to receiving this the inquisitors had written\r\nto Inquisitor-general Camargo lamenting his abandonment of them and the\r\ndishonor inflicted on the tribunal; they blushed to be accomplices in\r\nthis ruin and they tendered their resignations. The answer to this was\r\nsending the senior Inquisitor of Madrid to take charge of the tribunal,\r\nwith orders to the two remaining inquisitors to report in Madrid but,\r\non learning that they had obeyed the first orders, they were allowed to\r\nremain in Toledo.\r\n\r\nHow strong had been the pressure exerted on the Suprema to produce this\r\naction may be inferred from a protest in which, a month later, it poured\r\nforth to Philip V its bitterness of soul. The corregidor had violated\r\nthe privileges and immunities of the Inquisition; the inquisitors had\r\nbeen perfectly justified in their action, although too speedy in\r\naggravating the censures; they had been humiliated, while the corregidor\r\nand his underlings were boasting of their triumph over the Inquisition\r\nand of depriving it of the rights granted by the popes and the kings of\r\nSpain. The Suprema therefore asked that the senior inquisitor be allowed\r\nto return to Toledo, that Paniagua be released by the hands of the\r\ninquisitors, that his cocoa be restored and that the corregidor and\r\nalcalde mayor be duly punished. This accomplished nothing and two months\r\nlater it again appealed to the king for the release of Paniagua and the\r\nrestoration of the senior inquisitor, but this time it professed its\r\nzeal to see that in future the tribunals should practise more\r\nmoderation.[1218] The lesson was a hard one, but it had a still harder\r\none, in 1734, when Philip decided that a salaried official should be\r\ntried by the ordinary courts.[1219]\r\n\r\nStep by step the old-time privileges were being curtailed. Soon after\r\nthe accession of Fernando VI, some trouble arose at Llerena over the\r\ntaxation of familiars. It seems to have been aggravated in the usual\r\nmanner and, when it reached the king, it was of a character that induced\r\nhim to issue a decree, October 5, 1747, by which the Council of Castile\r\nwas given jurisdiction over the officials of the Inquisition. This\r\ncalled forth a heated remonstrance, dated November 1st, which must have\r\nproceeded from the Inquisitor-general Prado y Cuesta, for no other\r\nsubject would have dared thus to address his sovereign. The writer tells\r\nhim that the decree is unworthy of his name and his faith, nor is it\r\nwell that the world should see him, in the first year of his reign,\r\ndischarge such a thunderbolt against the Holy Office, such as it had\r\nnever received since its foundation, leaving it prostrated by the shock.\r\nHe affirms before God, and would wish to write it with his blood, that\r\nthe service of Jesus Christ and the prosperity of the king and his\r\nkingdoms require that the decree be returned to the royal hands, without\r\na copy being allowed to remain.[1220]\r\n\r\nAlthough this decree was not effective as to the salaried officials, the\r\nInquisition was falling upon evil days. It no longer inspired the\r\nold-time awe; it was no longer striving to extend its prerogatives, but\r\nwas fighting a losing battle to maintain them. A writer of about this\r\nperiod deplores its decadence; its commissioners and familiars serve\r\nwithout pay and the only reward for their labors and the cost of making\r\ntheir proofs of limpieza is the exemptions of pure honor granted by the\r\nkings, but now scarce one of these is observed and no fit persons seek\r\nthe positions, although they are much needed, for there are not a tenth\r\npart of those allowed by the Concordias.[1221] There is probably some\r\ntruth in this, for Inquisitor-general Prado y Cuesta, in appointing, at\r\nthe request of the tribunal of Valencia, Fray Vicente Latorre as\r\n_calificador_ or censor, asks why, when there are so many learned canons\r\nand professors in Valencia, who formerly were eager in seeking the\r\nposition, it had now fallen so greatly in estimation.[1222]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COMPETENCIAS]\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for the Inquisition to reconcile itself to the\r\ntendencies of the age and several cases, about this time, in which the\r\ntribunal of Valencia refused even to admit competencias, asserting that\r\nits combined ecclesiastical and royal jurisdictions rendered it the sole\r\njudge of all that concerned its officials, show that the old spirit\r\nstill lingered and found expression whenever it dared.[1223] Carlos III,\r\nhowever, was even more assertive of the royal prerogative than his\r\nbrother Fernando. We have seen his orders of 1763 concerning municipal\r\nand police regulations which included the prohibitions of carrying\r\nconcealed weapons and exporting money, in all of which familiars were\r\nwholly removed from the jurisdiction of the Inquisition, and in 1775 a\r\ncompetencia in Córdova caused him emphatically to order the inviolable\r\nobservance of this decree.[1224] All this led to the change in the\r\ncommissions of familiars as regards carrying arms, which was brought\r\nabout, in 1777, by the authorities of Alcalá la Real and Seville\r\nrefusing to register commissions issued by the tribunals of Toledo and\r\nSeville, because they were not in accordance with the new regulations.\r\nIn place, as of old, of blustering and coercing the magistrates, the\r\nSuprema collected from all the tribunals the formulas employed by them\r\nand framed a new one, phrased in a very different spirit and in\r\naccordance with the royal edicts.[1225]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat the endless quarrels which we have been considering ought to be\r\nsettled in an amicable manner was so self-evident that, from an early\r\nperiod, persistent efforts had been made to accomplish it, resulting in\r\nthe \"competencia\" so frequently alluded to above. Originally it would\r\nseem that there was no established procedure and that the Inquisition\r\nsettled for itself all questions arising with the magistrates. After the\r\nfirst opposition had been broken down these were not numerous, until the\r\nattribution of the fuero to the officials, and the enormous\r\nmultiplication of familiars and other unsalaried officers, gave occasion\r\nfor collisions with the courts. The earliest attempt that I have met to\r\nprovide a method of settlement is a cédula, issued about 1535 by the\r\nempress-regent in the absence of Charles V, ordering that, when there\r\nwas a dispute about jurisdiction, the president and judges of the royal\r\ncourt should meet the inquisitors and arrange matters harmoniously, so\r\nthat it should not be known that there had been a difference between\r\nthem. It was in conformity with this that, in 1542, when Joaquin de\r\nTunes was tried in Barcelona for the murder of Juan Ballell, a familiar,\r\nthe inquisitor, Miguel Puig, held a conference with the regent and\r\njudges of the royal chancellery, prior to the arrest, and the custody of\r\nthe accused was settled without difficulty. It was impossible, however,\r\nto preserve peace between classes mutually jealous, and we have seen (p.\r\n435) the troubles which Prince Philip endeavored to settle by the cédula\r\nof May 15, 1545. This favored the royal jurisdiction and produced\r\ncomplaints from the Suprema as when, in 1548, it represented to Charles\r\nV that in Granada the judges made the cédula a pretext to intervene in\r\nthe business of the tribunal, whenever any one made a complaint,\r\nrequiring the inquisitors to interrupt their work and come to the\r\nAudiencia, when they were ordered not to proceed and, if this was\r\ndisobeyed, the judges raised a great disturbance. All this would cease\r\nif the old rule were restored that any one feeling aggrieved must\r\nappeal to the Suprema where he would get justice.[1226] Prince Philip's\r\ncédula of 1553 settled this as far as concerned matters of faith, but\r\nneither it nor the Castilian Concordia of the same year could prevent\r\ndisputes over the immunities of the officials and familiars which the\r\nInquisition was persistently endeavoring to extend. The Concordia,\r\nhowever, endeavored to provide for the settlement of these by the\r\nprocess described above (p. 436) which became technically known as\r\ncompetencia. It is remarkable that, in the Valencia Concordia of 1554,\r\nthere is no such provision, but in that of 1568, for the Aragonese\r\nkingdoms, it appears in the slightly different form that the regent of\r\nthe Audiencia and the senior inquisitor should consult and endeavor to\r\ncome to some agreement. If they could not do so, the regent was to send\r\nhis side of the case to the Council of Aragon and the inquisitor his to\r\nthe Suprema, when the king would arrange how the matter should be\r\ndecided.[1227] The two formulas were combined in practice and remained\r\nthe established method of settling conflicts of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThis should have produced peace but we have seen that it only gave\r\noccasion for fresh subjects of discord. The inquisitors were restive\r\nunder any restraint on their arbitrary methods and already in 1560, a\r\ncarta acordada of November 14th warns them that they are not to proceed\r\nwith censures against the judges, when the latter offer competencias,\r\nbut are to send the papers to the Suprema and await the result, under a\r\npenalty of twenty ducats for every infraction of the rule.[1228] The\r\ninquisitors however avoided competencias as far as they could and, when\r\nobliged to concede them, the opportunity was taken of humiliating the\r\nroyal judges and make them feel their inferiority in a manner most\r\ngalling to men so tenacious of the respect due to position and so\r\ninsistent on courtesy. When de Soto Salazar reports of the inquisitors\r\nof Barcelona that, when they had occasion to notify the lieutenant of\r\nthe king or the regent of the Audiencia, they sent a messenger to summon\r\nhim and then kept him waiting in the antechamber and that sometimes they\r\ncalled the judges before them and scolded them without cause, we can\r\nreadily appreciate the intensity of the hatred thus excited.[1229]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COMPETENCIAS_]\r\n\r\nSo, when the Inquisition established its formula for competencias, they\r\nwere sedulously framed to be as arrogantly insulting as possible. The\r\nfirst mandate inhibits peremptorily the judge from action and orders him\r\nto remit the case to the tribunal within twenty-four hours. If an arrest\r\nhas been made the prisoner is to be discharged on bail to present\r\nhimself before the inquisitors and any property seized or sequestrated\r\nis to be released. If the secular judge has any reason to allege to the\r\ncontrary he is to present himself in person or by procurator to the\r\ntribunal, which will render justice, and all this is under holy\r\nobedience and the threat of major excommunication and a heavy fine. If\r\nthere are any papers in the case the scrivener is ordered to surrender\r\nthem, and the accuser or plaintiff is to appear within a time specified\r\nand receive justice, in default of which the case will be heard without\r\nhim and without further notice. Then, if a reply is made to this\r\nalleging reasons for not obeying, a second mandate is issued pronouncing\r\nthem insufficient and ordering the first one to be obeyed within a\r\nspecified time under the above penalties. If the judge then proposes a\r\ncompetencia, a mandate is sent to him reciting the previous ones and\r\nsaying that, to avoid, troubling the higher powers, he is ordered to\r\nsurrender all papers and suspend all action, or the excommunication and\r\nfine will be enforced on his person and property. The next mandate\r\naccepts the competencia, states that the tribunal is ready to forward\r\nits papers and orders the judges to send their side within twelve days,\r\nadding a threat of excommunication and fine if any additional testimony\r\nbe taken in the case. All this is phrased in the most mandatory fashion\r\nas of a superior addressing a subordinate and all these missives are\r\nordered to be returned to the tribunal. If, after a competencia was\r\nformed, the familiar or official accepted the jurisdiction of the\r\nsecular court, he was deprived of his commission. As we have frequently\r\nseen, there was no hesitation, at any stage of the proceedings, to\r\nexcommunicate the judges, to anathematize them and to lay an interdict\r\non the city, followed by a _cessatio a divinis_.[1230]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the gratification of thus humiliating the magistrates,\r\nthere was also in this truculence the object of rendering the process so\r\noffensive as to make them shrink from resisting the encroachments of the\r\nInquisition. When this failed the tribunal had abundant sources of\r\nannoyance in raising interminable questions of precedence and\r\nformalities, which were sometimes fought so bitterly and long as\r\nvirtually to supersede the original case. The points that could be\r\nraised were endless. In 1602, the Count of Benavente, then Viceroy of\r\nValencia, issued letters ordering a conference over the arrest of\r\nGerónimo Falcon; the tribunal surrendered him, admitting that the case\r\ndid not pertain to it, but demanded that the viceroy and chancellery\r\nshould cancel the letters on their records and, on refusal, it\r\nexcommunicated the regent. The matter was carried up to the Suprema and\r\nCouncil of Aragon, when the king decided that the letters must be\r\nexpunged and it was done in presence of a secretary of the Inquisition.\r\nThe same humiliation had been inflicted on the count's father, when he\r\nwas viceroy, and also on the Duke of Segorbe.[1231]\r\n\r\nThis arrogance continued until Carlos III, in his decree of 1775,\r\ninformed the Inquisition that the royal jurisdiction which it exercised\r\nwas on precisely the same level as that of his judges and magistrates;\r\nthere must be entire equality between them; all threats of\r\nexcommunication and fines must be abandoned; there must be free\r\ninterchange of papers, mutual courtesy and no assumption of superiority.\r\nIt was difficult for the tribunals to abandon the formulas which\r\nflattered their vanity and a second command was necessary, issued in\r\n1783, on the occasion of a prolonged conflict of the Valencia tribunal\r\nwith the alcalde of Consentaina. This finally produced obedience and the\r\nSuprema transmitted the royal order to Valencia with instructions for\r\nits observance.[1232]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MODERATION UNDER THE RESTORATION_]\r\n\r\nWhile this doubtless diminished the exasperation of these conflicts, it\r\ndid not check their frequency. They continued to be a constant source of\r\ntrouble and it was from a desire to diminish this, as well as to extend\r\nits authority, that the Suprema, in 1806, forbade the tribunals from\r\ninstituting them without submitting the case to it and receiving its\r\napproval.[1233] When, under the Restoration, the Inquisition was\r\nrevived, in 1814, the officials naturally claimed the fuero, active and\r\npassive, civil and criminal, and Fernando VII, in the decision of a\r\ncase carried up to him from Seville, announced, February 15, 1815, in no\r\nuncertain tones, that they should be protected in its enjoyment, but the\r\ncases appear to be rare and the aggressive spirit had disappeared.[1234]\r\nWhen, in Seville, the creditors of Francisco de Paula Esquivol\r\ncomplained of him to the tribunal, in place of defending him, it\r\npromptly dismissed him, June 27, 1815, an action which was confirmed by\r\nthe Suprema.[1235] Even more significant was a case, in 1816, when in\r\nSeville Lorenzo Ayllon abused a priest while celebrating mass and\r\nendeavored to seize the sacrament, and the secular authorities arrested\r\nand proceeded to try him. In such a case there could be no question as\r\nto the jurisdiction of the Inquisition, but there was no disturbance,\r\nand when the tribunal claimed his transfer to the secret prison the\r\nSuprema interposed and ordered that he should be allowed to remain in\r\nthe public gaol, a detainer being lodged to prevent his discharge during\r\nhis trial--a concession to the royal jurisdiction which would have\r\npetrified Pacheco or Arce y Reynoso.[1236]\r\n\r\nThere was the same disposition to avoid coming to extremes with the\r\nspiritual courts. In 1816 the provisor of the see of Tuy prosecuted\r\nJoseph Metzcler for impious, execrable and sacrilegious blasphemies. The\r\ntribunal of Santiago applied, in a courteous note, to the provisor for\r\nthe papers and received a reply without signature. This the Suprema\r\ndirected it to return and explain that there was no desire to invade the\r\nepiscopal jurisdiction, but as the blasphemous propositions and acts of\r\nMetzcler might be heretical, of which the Inquisition had exclusive\r\ncognizance, it must insist on seeing the evidence to extract what\r\nappertained to it, after which the papers would be returned. It seems to\r\nhave obtained the evidence for, on October 15, 1817, it voted to\r\nimprison Metzcler, as soon as his trial by the provisor should be ended,\r\nbut the Suprema instructed it not to wait for this, as the jurisdiction\r\nof the Inquisition was privileged.[1237]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was one peculiarly irritating feature in the position of the\r\nInquisition in these quarrels, which exacerbated them greatly and often\r\nneutralized all efforts to maintain harmony--the power which it\r\narrogated to itself of refusing to form competencias on the ground that\r\nits rights were too clear to admit of debate. Thus it held that the\r\nsalaried and titular officials, with their families and servants, were\r\nso wholly beyond all secular jurisdiction that it refused to entertain\r\nany proceedings in contest of their claims. It was in vain that Philip\r\nIII, by a royal letter of 1615, declared that if inquisitors refused a\r\nconference, on the ground that the matter was too clear to justify it,\r\nthe regent of the chancellery should form a competencia and forward the\r\npapers as usual.[1238] It was equally useless for Philip IV to decree,\r\nin 1630, that when a contention was started by either party, the other\r\nmust entertain it, no matter how clear it might be, under pain, for a\r\nfirst offence, of five hundred ducats and, for a second, of suspension\r\nduring the royal pleasure. To ensure the imposition of the fine, each\r\nCouncil was to give the other faculties for its collection from\r\noffenders, but, when the Suprema forwarded this decree to the tribunals,\r\nwith orders for its strict observance, it added significantly that it\r\ndid not apply to cases of salaried and titular officials, though no such\r\nexception was made in the decree. It knew that Philip would never summon\r\ncourage to enforce his law and it was right. When, in 1633, the Council\r\nof Aragon endeavored to collect such a fine, the Suprema interposed,\r\nasserting that it could only be done by consent of both Councils, which\r\nwas, in effect, to invalidate the law, and Philip himself violated it,\r\nin 1634, when Augustin Vidal, messenger of the tribunal of Valencia, was\r\narrested by the royal court for the murder of Juan Alonso Martínez, a\r\nKnight of Santiago and Bayle of Alicante. The tribunal demanded him and\r\nrefused a competencia, when Philip weakly ordered him to be surrendered\r\n\"for this time and without prejudice to my royal jurisdiction.\"[1239]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _REFUSAL OF COMPETENCIAS_]\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition carried its point. Philip, by decisions of 1645 and\r\n1658, admitted that there could be no competencias in the case of\r\nsalaried officials and the Suprema enforced these decisions by a carta\r\nacordada of August 7, 1662, pointing out that they must not be\r\nentertained where such officials were concerned; at the same time\r\ntribunals were warned to exercise moderation and not to employ censures\r\nwithout consulting it, unless delay was inadmissible.[1240] Even Philip\r\nhowever had to intervene against the consequences of his own acts, in\r\n1664, when the portero of the tribunal of Logroño killed in his house a\r\npriest, apparently through jealousy. The alcalde mayor prosecuted the\r\nmurderer and arrested his wife; the tribunal excommunicated the alcalde\r\nand cast an interdict on the town. The Council of Aragon formed a\r\ncompetencia and claimed that during it the censures should be raised\r\naccording to custom, but the Suprema refused on the ground that there\r\ncould be no competencia. Philip was appealed to and ordered the censures\r\nraised for the unanswerable reason that as judges under excommunication\r\ncould not hold their courts, if it were allowed thus to paralyze all\r\njudicial business it would have arbitrary control over all cases and\r\nfrustrate all legal remedies.[1241] This decision was disregarded. It\r\nseems extraordinary that any community would endure for centuries the\r\nindefinite stoppage of the administration of justice, constantly\r\noccurring through the reckless abuse of the power of excommunication, as\r\nwhen, in 1672, we find the queen-regent applying to the\r\ninquisitor-general to know how she is to answer the complaints of the\r\ntown of Logroño at the prolonged suspension of the powers of the\r\ncorregidor who lay under excommunication, seeing that there is no\r\nconclusion of the competencia which has been so long pending.[1242]\r\n\r\nThe Inquisition evidently aggravated as far as it could the public\r\ndistress as a means of establishing its claims. In an effort to limit\r\nthe abuse of refusing competencias, there was a junta formed, in 1679,\r\nfrom the Suprema and Council of State with the assistance of some\r\ntheologians. This admitted that there could be no competencia in the\r\ncases of salaried officials, except when they held public office and\r\nwere prosecuted for malfeasance, but it laid down the rule that, when\r\nthe Suprema refused a competencia, the Council of State could appeal to\r\nthe king who could appoint a junta to decide this secondary question. A\r\nlimited time was allowed to the Suprema to state its reasons for refusal\r\nand during a competencia the accused was to be liberated on bail and\r\nall censures were to be raised.[1243] This removed some of the\r\nhardships, but the Suprema seems to have sought to evade it by sullenly\r\nrefusing to form the juntas with the Royal Councils, for another decree\r\nof Carlos II ordered it to attend when summoned so that these affairs\r\nmight be settled.[1244] It was in vain that, in 1730, the Council of\r\nCastile urged that competencias be admitted in all cases, for Philip V\r\ndecided that the agreement of 1679 should stand.[1245] Probably not much\r\nwas gained in the latest attempt to settle these perennial quarrels by\r\nCarlos IV in 1804, who ordered that when a conflict arose between a\r\nroyal court and a tribunal, in a matter not of faith concerning an\r\nofficial, the court should refer the case to the governor of the Royal\r\nCouncil and the tribunal to the Suprema. These should then select an\r\nexaminer who was to report to the Secretaría de Gracia y Justicia for\r\nthe royal decision.[1246]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PROTRACTED DELAYS_]\r\n\r\nThe evils of the system were admitted on all hands, but it was so\r\nvicious in principle that remedies were impossible. The customary juntas\r\nof two members each from the Suprema and the Council of Castile or of\r\nAragon was at best a clumsy device, onerous on the Councils and usually\r\nleading only to procrastination. To systematize it, in 1625, a permanent\r\nJunta Grande de Competencias was formed of two members from each\r\nCouncil, whose duty it should be to despatch all cases, and rules for it\r\nwere framed in April, 1626, but it was short-lived. In 1634 Philip IV\r\nordered the formation of a junta of two members each of the Suprema and\r\nCouncil of Castile to formulate a plan of relief, but, on June 9th of\r\nthat year, the Suprema reported that it had never been able to\r\naccomplish a meeting of the Junta. Then, in 1657, the Junta Grande was\r\nresuscitated and we meet with an allusion to it in 1659, but it appears\r\nto have been abandoned soon afterwards.[1247] Ingenuity was at fault to\r\nalleviate the evils inseparable from the permanent antagonism between\r\nthe rival jurisdictions. Of these evils the one most keenly felt was\r\nthe interminable delay in the settlement of cases. The councils from\r\nwhich the members were drawn were crowded with their more legitimate\r\nbusiness; there was rarely accord in the junta; the matter would be\r\nargued without expectation of agreement; each side would be obstinate;\r\nperhaps the case would be referred to the king or years would pass\r\nbefore a settlement would be reached; perhaps, indeed, it would be\r\nsilently dropped without a decision, especially when a decision might be\r\nundesirable because one or both sides feared a troublesome precedent.\r\nMeanwhile the case remained petrified in the condition existing at the\r\ntime the competencia was formed. Until the so-called Concordia of 1679\r\npermitted the release of prisoners on bail, if any one had been\r\narrested, he remained in prison, perhaps to die there as sometimes\r\noccurred. In 1638 the Inquisition complained of this, when its officers\r\nhappened to be the prisoners, for competencias were always slow of\r\nsettlement and the work of the tribunals was crippled for lack of their\r\nministers, while their poverty precluded their giving adequate salaries\r\nto substitutes.[1248] It was not until 1721 that a remedy for this\r\nprocrastination was sought by Philip V in a decree reciting the long\r\ndelays and the frequency of cases remaining undecided by reason of a\r\ndead-lock in the junta, wherefore in future when a junta was formed, he\r\nwas to be notified in order that he might appoint a fifth member, thus\r\nassuring a majority.[1249] It does not seem however that this\r\naccomplished its purpose and, when Carlos III consolidated the cumbrous\r\nframework of government by instituting the _Junta de Estado_, composed\r\nof the ministers of the several departments, Floridablanca enumerates,\r\namong the benefits accruing, the expediting of cases of competencia and\r\navoiding the interminable delays caused by the etiquette of the\r\ntribunals and the intrigues of the parties concerned.[1250]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have dwelt thus in detail on this subject, not only because it\r\nabsorbed so large a portion of the activity of the Inquisition, but\r\nbecause of its importance in the relations between the Holy Office and\r\nthe other institutions of Spain and in explaining the detestation which\r\nthe Inquisition excited. If the people regarded it as a whole with awe\r\nand veneration, as the bulwark of the Catholic faith, their hatred was\r\nnone the less for its members, and the perpetual struggle against the\r\ntremendous odds of its power, supported by the unflinching favor of the\r\nHapsburgs, bears equal testimony to the tenacity of the Spanish\r\ncharacter and to the magnitude of the evils with which the Inquisition\r\nafflicted the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPOPULAR HOSTILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapters illustrate some of the causes that provoked\r\npopular hatred of the Inquisition, but these were by no means all. It\r\nenjoyed, as we have said, enthusiastic support in the exercise of its\r\nappropriate functions in defending the faith, but apart from this, it\r\nhad infinite ways of exciting hostility. This was the inevitable result\r\nof entrusting irresponsible power to men, for the most part overbearing\r\nand arrogant, who owed obedience only to the Suprema and who early\r\nlearned that, while it might disapprove of their acts, it always\r\nsupported them against complaints and, while it might administer rebuke\r\nin secret, it hesitated long before it would compromise the asserted\r\ninfallibility of the Holy Office by dismissal or any other public\r\ndemonstration. There was no other power to call them to account and they\r\ncould rely upon its indulgence. This indulgence they extended to their\r\nsubordinates, over whom, indeed, they had not the power of removal, and\r\nthe consequence was that the whole body thoroughly earned the\r\ndetestation of the people by the abuse of their privileges, creating\r\nirritation which was none the less exasperating because its causes might\r\nbe trivial. The situation finds expression in a carta acordada of\r\nOctober 12, 1561, in which the Suprema begs the tribunals, for the love\r\nof God, to inflict no wrong or oppression for, since they are accused\r\nwhen they do right, what is to be expected when they give just grounds\r\nof complaint?[1251]\r\n\r\nWhether just or not, grounds of complaint were never lacking. The power\r\nof the inquisitor had practically scarce any bounds but his own\r\ndiscretion, and the temptation to its abuse was irresistible to the kind\r\nof men who mostly filled the position. In the memorial of Llerena to\r\nPhilip and Juana, in 1506, complaint is made that the officials seized\r\nall the houses that they wanted and in one case, when some young orphan\r\ngirls did not vacate as quickly as ordered, they fastened up the\r\nstreet-door and the occupants were obliged to make an opening in order\r\nto leave it.[1252] The same spirit was shown to parties not quite so\r\ndefenceless in 1642, when its exhibition in Córdova nearly provoked a\r\ndisastrous tumult. There was a vacant house which Juan de Ribera, one of\r\nthe inquisitors, talked of renting, but he went to Murcia without taking\r\nit. On his return he found that it had been leased to a son of Don Pedro\r\nde Cardenas, one of the veinticuatros, or town-councillors. He sent for\r\nCardenas and asked whether he knew that he had engaged the house.\r\nCardenas professed ignorance, adding that, if he had not moved his\r\nfamily into it, he would abandon it. Ribera ordered him to leave it and,\r\non his refusal, the tribunal took up the quarrel by serving on him a\r\nnotice to quit. As he did not obey, it cited him to appear and forced\r\nhim to give security. His kinsmen and friends rallied around him and\r\npromised to sustain him by force; the matter became town-talk and the\r\ntribunal felt its honor engaged to sustain its commands by violence. It\r\nassembled the two companies of soldiers which it kept in the alcázar,\r\nwhile the caballeros armed themselves and guarded the house. The\r\ncorregidor appealed to the tribunal not to drench the city in blood by\r\nexposing the poor civic militia to the swords of the gentlemen, and it\r\nconsented to carry the matter to the king. The Council of Castile\r\nordered that the tenant be maintained in possession, while the Suprema\r\ninstructed the tribunal not to yield a jot, but to eject him by whatever\r\nmeans it could.[1253] What was the outcome does not appear, but the case\r\nillustrates the extent to which the Inquisition magnified its powers and\r\nthe determination with which it employed them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ABUSES_]\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to prevent these lawless abuses. The Suprema might\r\nscold and threaten but, as it rarely punished and always protected the\r\noffenders, its restraining efforts amounted to little. The\r\n_visitadores_, or inspectors, duly reported disorders, and instructions\r\nwould be issued to reform them, but to these the inquisitors paid little\r\nrespect. There is no reason to suppose that the Barcelona tribunal was\r\nworse than any other and a series of reports of visitations there gives\r\nus an insight into the evils inflicted on the people. In 1544, Doctor\r\nAlonso Pérez sent in a report in consequence of which the Suprema\r\nroundly rebuked all the subordinates, except the judge of confiscations.\r\nAll but two were defamed for improper relations with women; all\r\naccepted presents; all made extra and illegal charges; all neglected\r\ntheir duties and most of them quarrelled with each other. The fiscal was\r\nespecially objectionable for his improper conduct of prosecutions and\r\nfor appropriating articles belonging to the tribunal; he refused to pay\r\nhis debts; he arrested a candle-maker for not furnishing candles as\r\npromptly as he demanded; when a certain party bought some sheep from a\r\npeasant and was dissatisfied with his bargain, the fiscal cited the\r\npeasant, asserted that the purchase money was his and forced the peasant\r\nto take back the sheep and return the money. Yet the Suprema was too\r\ntender of the honor of the Holy Office to dismiss a single one of the\r\npeccant officials. It ordered them to be severely reprimanded, a few\r\ndebts to be paid and presents to be returned and uttered some vague\r\nthreats of what it would do if they continued in their evil\r\ncourses.[1254]\r\n\r\nThe natural result of this indulgence appears in the next visitation by\r\nthe Licenciado Vaca, in 1549. The same abuses were flourishing, with the\r\naddition that the inquisitor, Diego de Sarmiento, had accepted the\r\nposition of commissioner of the Cruzada indulgence and had appointed as\r\nits preachers and collectors the commissioners and familiars of the\r\ntribunal, to the great oppression and vexation of the people, whose\r\ndread of the Holy Office prevented complaints. Sarmiento was dismissed\r\nin 1550, but in 1552 he was reappointed to Barcelona; the fiscal and\r\nnotary, who were specially inculpated, were suspended for six months and\r\nthe gaoler, for ill-treatment of prisoners, was mulcted in one month's\r\nwages.[1255] In 1561 another visitation was made by Inquisitor Gaspar\r\nCervantes, whose report was exceedingly severe on the disorders of the\r\ntribunal and drew from the Suprema an energetic demand for their\r\nreform.[1256] This produced no amendment, the tribunal went on\r\nundisturbed until the complaints of the Córtes of 1564 led to another\r\nand more searching investigation by de Soto Salazar, in 1566. There were\r\nnot only abuses of all kinds in the trials of heresy but numerous cases\r\nin which, as the Suprema told them, they had no jurisdiction. Apparently\r\nthey were ready to put their unlimited powers at the disposal of all\r\ncomers and imprisoned, fined and punished in the most arbitrary manner,\r\ngathering fees, commissions and doubtless bribes and selling injustice\r\nto all who wanted it, while the dread of their censures prevented\r\nopposition or remonstrance. In these cases which were not of faith, the\r\naccused were often seized in the churches, where they had sought asylum,\r\nas though they were wanted for heresy and the repeated instances in\r\nwhich the Suprema orders their names stricken from the records points to\r\none of the most cruel results of this reckless abuse of jurisdiction,\r\nfor it inflicted on the sufferer, his kindred and posterity, an infamy\r\nunendurable to the Spaniard of the period. The long and detailed missive\r\nwhich the Suprema addressed to the tribunal, as the result of Salazar's\r\nreport, gives a most vivid inside view of the abuses naturally springing\r\nfrom unrestrained autocracy, which, by the absolute and impenetrable\r\nsecrecy of its operations, was relieved from all responsibility to its\r\nvictims or to public opinion. The Suprema takes every official in turn,\r\nfrom inquisitors down to messengers, specifies their misdeeds and scores\r\nthem mercilessly, showing that the whole organization was solely intent\r\non making dishonest gains, on magnifying its privileges and on\r\ntyrannizing over the community, while the defence of the faith was the\r\nbaldest pretext for the gratification of greed and evil passions. Yet\r\nall this was practically regarded as quite compatible with the duties of\r\nthe Inquisition. The three inquisitors, Padilla, Zurita and Mexia, were\r\nsuspended for three years and were then sent to repeat their misdeeds\r\nelsewhere and the two former were in addition fined ten ducats\r\napiece.[1257] That an institution possessing these powers and exercising\r\nthem in such fashion, should be regarded with terror and detestation was\r\ninevitable. We shall see hereafter how it shrouded all its acts in\r\ninviolable secrecy and how it rightly regarded this as one of the most\r\nimportant factors of its influence, and we can understand the mysterious\r\ndread which this inspired, while, at the same time, it released the\r\ninquisitor and his subordinates from the wholesome restraint of\r\npublicity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ABUSES_]\r\n\r\nThe smothered hostility thus excited was always ready for an explosion\r\nwhen opportunity offered to gratify it. In the desire to stimulate the\r\nbreeding of horses, a royal pragmática, in 1628, prohibited the use of\r\nmules for coaches. The inquisitors of Logroño, in the full confidence\r\nthat no one would venture to interfere with them, persisted in driving\r\nwith mules and when the corregidor, Don Francisco Bazan, remonstrated\r\nand threatened to seize a coach, they told him it would be his ruin. He\r\ndid not venture, but, in 1633, he procured from the Council of Castile\r\nan order that no coaches should be used in Logroño, under pretext that\r\nthey damaged certain shops projecting on the principal street. The\r\nfiscal of the tribunal undertook to meet this by asserting that it had a\r\nspecial privilege from the king concerning coaches, but when Bazan\r\npromised to obey, it was not forthcoming. The Suprema took up the\r\nquarrel and represented to Philip IV the hardship inflicted on the\r\ninquisitors, too old and feeble for the saddle; the compassionate king\r\nendorsed on the consulta the customary formula of approval--\"I have so\r\nordered\"; the Suprema then applied to the Council of Castile for a\r\ncorresponding order and several communications passed without result.\r\nAnother consulta was presented to the king, who endorsed it \"I have so\r\nordered again,\" but the Council of Castile was still evasive. Then the\r\nLogroño authorities offered to the Bishop of Calahorra permission to use\r\ncoaches and intimated to the inquisitors that, if they would apply for a\r\nlicence, it would be given. The Suprema forbade them thus to recognize\r\nthe local magistracy, as they had royal authority, whereupon they\r\nresumed the use of their coaches; the alguazil of the corregidor\r\narrested one of their coachmen and they excommunicated the corregidor.\r\nThe king, December 9, 1633, ordered him to be absolved, to which, on\r\nDecember 30th, the Suprema replied that he would be absolved if he made\r\napplication. The Council of Castile presented to the king a consulta,\r\narguing that ecclesiastics and inquisitors alike owed obedience to the\r\nlaws and that the corregidor had acted with great moderation. February\r\n5, 1634, the king enquired what had been done with the corregidor, but\r\nit was not until December 16th that the Suprema condescended to reply,\r\ncomplaining bitterly of the slight put upon the Inquisition, when the\r\nwhole safety of the monarchy depended upon its labors. Finally, on\r\nFebruary 15, 1635, the Council of Castile sent to the Suprema a licence\r\nfor the use of coaches in Logroño, at the same time intimating that its\r\ntax of _media añata_ had not been paid. In the course of the quarrel the\r\nCouncil presented a very forcible consulta to the king which exhibits\r\nthe light in which the Inquisition was regarded by the highest\r\nauthorities of the State. It represented that everywhere the\r\ninquisitors and their officials, under color of privileges that they did\r\nnot possess, were causing grave disorders. They were vexing and\r\nmolesting the corregidors and other ministers of the king, oppressing\r\nthem with violent methods and frightening them with threats of\r\npunishment in order to deter them from defending the royal jurisdiction.\r\nThus crimes remained unpunished, justice became a mockery and the king's\r\nvassals were afflicted with what they were made to suffer in their\r\nhonor, their lives, their fortunes and their consciences.[1258]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ABUSES_]\r\n\r\nTrivial quarrels such as this, developed until they distracted the\r\nattention of the king and his advisers, were constantly breaking out and\r\nbear testimony to the antagonistic spirit which was all-pervading. A\r\nlong-standing cause of dissension in Logroño may be taken as a type of\r\nwhat was occurring in many other places. Local officials there, as\r\nelsewhere, had a perquisite in the public _carnicería_, or shambles, of\r\ndividing among themselves the _vientres_ or _menudos_--the\r\nchitterlings--of the beasts slaughtered. It was not unnatural that the\r\ninquisitors and their subordinates should seek to share in this, but the\r\nclaim was grudgingly admitted, as it diminished the portions of the town\r\nofficers, and it led to bickerings. In 1572 Logroño complained to the\r\nSuprema that, while it was willing to give to each inquisitor the\r\n_menudo_ of a sheep every week, the inferior officials, down to the\r\nmessengers, claimed the same and, when there was not enough to go round,\r\nthey caused the slaughter of additional sheep, in order to get their\r\nperquisite. As the population was poor, living mostly on cow-beef, and\r\nmeat would not keep in hot weather, this caused much waste, wherefore\r\nthe town begged that during the four hot months the inferior officials\r\nshould be content with what the town officers received and during the\r\nother eight months it would endeavor to give them more. To this the\r\nSuprema graciously assented, but, in 1577, there was another outbreak,\r\nto quiet which the Suprema ordered the enforcement of the agreement. In\r\n1584 trouble arose again and still more in 1593 and in 1601 it reached a\r\npoint at which the tribunal summoned all the staff of the carnicería and\r\nscolded them roundly, giving rise to great excitement. Then in 1620\r\nthere was a worse outbreak than ever, owing to the refusal of the\r\nregidor to give to one of the inquisitors two pairs of sheep's stones\r\nasked for on the plea that he had guests to breakfast. The angry\r\ninquisitor, thus deprived of his breakfast relish, induced the tribunal\r\nto summon the regidor before it and severely reprimand him, thus not\r\nonly inflicting a grave stigma on him, but insulting the town, of which\r\nit complained loudly to the Suprema.[1259] It is easy to understand how\r\ntrifles of the kind kept up a perpetual irritation, of which only the\r\nexacerbations appear in the records.\r\n\r\nThe privileges of the markets, in fact, were a source of endless\r\ntroubles. It was recognized that both secular and ecclesiastical\r\nofficials were entitled to the first choice and to be served first.\r\nThose of the Inquisition claimed the same privilege, not only in cities\r\nwhere there was a tribunal, but also where the scattered commissioners\r\nand notaries resided. That this was frequently resisted is shown by the\r\nformula of mandate to be used in such cases, addressed to the corregidor\r\nor alcaldes, setting forth that the rights in this respect of the\r\naggrieved party had not been respected and that in future he should have\r\nthe first and best (after the secular and ecclesiastical officials had\r\nbeen served) of all provisions that he required, at current prices, and\r\nthis under penalty of twenty thousand maravedís, besides punishment to\r\nthe full rigor of the law.[1260] It does not appear that there really\r\nwas any legislation entitling the Inquisition to this privilege, but in\r\nthe frequent troubles arising from its assertion, the inquisitors acted\r\nwith their customary truculence. A writer, in 1609, who deprecates these\r\nquarrels, suggests as a cure that the king issue a decree that the\r\nrepresentatives of the Inquisition shall have preference in purchasing\r\nand, at the same time, he tells of a case in Toledo where a regidor, who\r\ntold the steward of the tribunal to take as many eggs as he wanted, but\r\nno more, was arrested and prosecuted, and of another in Córdova, where a\r\nhidalgo, who had bought a shad and refused to give it up to an\r\nacquaintance of a servant of an inquisitor, was punished with two\r\nhundred lashes and sent to the galleys.[1261] In 1608 the Suprema issued\r\nan injunction that purveyors of inquisitors should take nothing by\r\nforce, the significance of which lies rather in the indication of\r\nexisting abuses than in its promise of their removal.[1262] The claim of\r\npreference was pushed so far that in Seville, in 1705, there arose a\r\nserious trouble because the servant of an inquisitor detained boat-loads\r\nof fish coming to market, in order to make his selection, and it\r\nrequired a royal cédula of March 26, 1705, forbidding inquisitors to\r\ndetain fish or other provisions on the way, or to designate by\r\n_banderillas_ the pieces selected for themselves.[1263] When we consider\r\nthe character of the slaves and servants thus clothed with authority to\r\ninsult and browbeat whomsoever they chose, in the exercise of such\r\nfunctions, we can conceive the wrath and indignation stored up against\r\ntheir masters in the thousands of cases where fear prevented an\r\nexplosion. It is true that the Suprema issued instructions that all\r\npurveyors should behave themselves modestly and give no ground of\r\noffence and that no one should be summoned or imprisoned for matters\r\narising out of provisions, but as usual these orders were disregarded.\r\nInsolence would naturally elicit a hasty rejoinder which, as reported by\r\nthe servant to his master, would imply disrespect towards the Holy\r\nOffice, and severe punishment would be justified on that account.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps less irritating but more serious in its effects was the use made\r\nof the fuero by those engaged in trade. Inquisitor-general Deza, in\r\n1504, issued a stringent prohibition against any salaried official\r\nhaving an interest, direct or indirect, in any business. Daily\r\nexperience, he said, showed how much opprobrium and disturbance it\r\nbrought upon the Inquisition, wherefore he decreed that it should, _ipso\r\nfacto_, deprive the offender of his position and subject him to a fine\r\nof twenty thousand maravedís; he should cease to be an official as soon\r\nas contravention occurred and the receiver, under pain of fifty ducats,\r\nshould cut off his salary. All officials cognizant of such a case should\r\nnotify the inquisitor-general within fifteen days, under pain of major\r\nexcommunication, and this order was to be read in all tribunals in\r\npresence of the assembled officials.[1264]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OFFICIALS AS TRADERS_]\r\n\r\nThe severity of this regulation indicates the recognized magnitude of\r\nthe evil, and its retention in the compilation of Instructions shows\r\nthat it was considered as remaining in force. Like all other salutary\r\nrules, however, it was slackly enforced from the first and the Catalans\r\ntook care to have the prohibition embodied in the bull _Pastoralis\r\nofficii_. It gradually became obsolete. A royal decree of August 9,\r\n1725, in exempting from taxation the salaries of officials of the\r\ntribunal of Saragossa, adds that, if they possess property or are in\r\ntrade, those assets are taxable, showing that their ability to trade was\r\nrecognized.[1265] How aggravating was the advantage which they thus\r\nenjoyed can be gathered from a Valencia case of about 1750. Joseph\r\nSegarra, the contador of the tribunal, entered into partnership with\r\nJoseph Miralles, a carpenter, to bring timber from the Sierra de Cuenca.\r\nIn the settlement Segarra claimed from Miralles a balance of 1779\r\nlibras; they entered into a formal agreement to accept the arbitration\r\nof Doctor Boyl, but Segarra rejected the award and Miralles sought to\r\nenforce it in the royal court. Then the tribunal intervened, asserting\r\nthe award to be invalid because Segarra could not divest the Inquisition\r\nof its jurisdiction and it refused the request of the regent for a\r\nconference and a competencia.[1266] Evidently it was dangerous to have\r\ndealings with officials; they always had a winning card up the sleeve,\r\nto be played when needed.\r\n\r\nAs regards the great army of familiars, it was of course impossible to\r\nprevent them from trading. In fact traders eagerly sought the position\r\nin view of the advantages it offered of having the Inquisition at their\r\nbacks, whether to escape payment of debts or to collect claims or to\r\nevade customs dues, or in many other ways, not recognized by the\r\nConcordias but allowed by the tribunals. The Suprema occasionally warned\r\nthe inquisitors not to appoint men of low class, such as butchers,\r\npastry-cooks, shoemakers and the like, or traders whose object was\r\nprotection in their business,[1267] but no attention was paid to this; a\r\nlarge portion of the familiars was of this class, and the space occupied\r\nin the formularies by forms of levy and execution and sale and other\r\nsimilar matters shows how much business was brought to the tribunals by\r\nthe collection of their claims.[1268] The opportunities thus afforded\r\nfor fraudulent dealings, for evading obligations and for enforcing\r\nunjust demands were assuredly not neglected and may be reckoned among\r\nthe sources of the animosity felt for everyone connected with the Holy\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nIn the remarkable paper presented, in 1623, to the Suprema by one of its\r\nmembers, many of the abuses of the Inquisition are attributed to the\r\nindifferent character and poverty of the officials. It would be well,\r\nthe writer says, to appoint none but clerics, holding preferment to\r\nsupport themselves and unencumbered with wife and children. They would\r\nnot, when dying, leave penniless families, which obliges the\r\ninquisitor-general to give to the children their fathers' offices, thus\r\nbringing into the tribunals men who cannot even read; an increase of\r\nsalaries, also, would relieve them of the necessity of taking bribes\r\nunder cover of fees, and thus would put a stop to the popular murmurs\r\nagainst them. The inquisitors moreover should have power of removal,\r\nsubject to confirmation by the Suprema, for now their hands are tied;\r\ntheir subordinates are unruly and uncontrollable. The greatest injury to\r\nthe reputation of the Holy Office arises from its bad officials, who\r\nrecognize no responsibility. No one should be appointed to office, or as\r\na familiar, who is a tailor, carpenter, mason or other mechanic; it is\r\nthese people who cause quarrels with the secular authorities, for they\r\nhave little to lose and claim to be inviolable. In short, if we may\r\nbelieve the writer, the whole body of the tribunals, except the\r\ninquisitors, was rotten; none of the officials, from the fiscals down,\r\nwere to be trusted, for all were eagerly in pursuit of dishonest gains,\r\nrobbing the Inquisition itself and all who came in contact with it, and\r\nto this he attributed its loss of public respect and confidence.[1269]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COMPLAINTS OF FEUDALISM_]\r\n\r\nMatters did not improve, for the Suprema always defended the tribunals\r\nfrom all complaints, and its tenderness towards delinquents assured them\r\nof virtual impunity. At length, as we have seen, in 1703, Philip V made\r\nan attempt at reform. It was probably owing to this pressure that, in\r\n1705, the Suprema issued a carta acordada prohibiting a number of\r\nspecial abuses and pointing out that, in regard to the proprieties of\r\nlife, neither inquisitors nor officials obeyed the Instructions,\r\nconsorting with improper persons and intervening in matters wholly\r\nforeign to their duties, thus rendering odious the jurisdiction of the\r\nHoly Office.[1270] From various incidents alluded to above it is\r\nevident that this produced little amendment but, when the vacillation\r\nof Philip V was succeeded by the resolute purpose of Carlos III and his\r\nable ministers, the power of the Inquisition to oppress was greatly\r\ncurbed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not alone the commonalty that had reason to complain of the\r\nextended jurisdiction claimed by the Inquisition. The feudal nobles,\r\nwhose rights were already curtailed by the growth of the royal power,\r\nwere restive under the interjection of this new and superior\r\njurisdiction, which recognized no limitations or boundaries and\r\ninterfered with their supremacy within their domains. Thus in 1553, the\r\nDuke of Najera complained that, in his town of Navarrete, the\r\ncommissioner of the Inquisition had insulted his alcalde mayor and then,\r\nwith some familiars, had forcibly taken wheat from his alguazil.\r\nInquisitor-general Valdés wrote to the tribunal of Calahorra to\r\ninvestigate the matter and punish the officials if found in fault; the\r\nalcalde and alguazil were not to be prosecuted save for matters\r\npertaining to the Inquisition and this not only in view of its proper\r\nadministration but because he desired to gratify the duke.[1271]\r\n\r\nA still more serious cause of complaint, to which the nobles were fully\r\nalive, was the release of their vassals from jurisdiction by appointment\r\nto office. In 1549, the Countess of Nieva appealed to Valdés, setting\r\nforth that Arnedo was a place belonging to the count; it was within\r\nthree leagues of Calahorra and there had never been a familiar there\r\nuntil recently Inquisitor Valdeolivas had appointed some peasants in\r\norder to enfranchise them from the jurisdiction of their lord. It was\r\nnot just that, while the count was absent from the kingdom on the king's\r\nservice, his peasants should be thus honored in order that they might\r\ncreate disturbance in the villages and interfere with the feudal\r\njurisdiction.[1272] It may well be doubted whether her request for the\r\nrevocation of the commissions was granted, but that her prevision of\r\ntrouble was justified is seen in a case before the tribunal of\r\nBarcelona, in 1577, in which Don Pedro de Queral, lord of Santa Coloma,\r\na powerful noble of Tarragona, endeavored to secure the punishment of\r\ntwo of his vassals, Juan Requesens, a miller, and his cousin Vicente.\r\nThey were both familiars and seem to have been the leaders of a\r\ndiscontented opposition which rendered Don Pedro's life miserable. The\r\ntrees in his plantations were cut down, his arms, over the door of his\r\nbayle in Santa Coloma, were removed and defaced, libellous _coplas_\r\nagainst him were scattered around the streets, but the cousins, being\r\nfamiliars, were safe from his wrath. Don Pedro died but the trouble\r\ncontinued between his widow, the Countess of Queral and a new generation\r\nof Requesens, who succeeded to their fathers' office of familiars.\r\nFinally, in 1608, she succeeded in convicting Juan Requesens of\r\nmalicious mischief, but her only satisfaction was that he was\r\nreprimanded, warned and sentenced to pay the costs, amounting to 115-1/2\r\nreales.[1273] Such a case shows how feudalism was undermined and we can\r\nconceive how nobles must have writhed under the novel experience of\r\nrebellious vassals clothed with inviolability.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PERSISTENT ANTAGONISM_]\r\n\r\nIt is easy therefore to understand the detestation felt for the\r\nInquisition by all classes--laymen and ecclesiastics, noble and simple.\r\nIt was fully aware of this and constantly alleged it to the king when\r\ndefending the tribunals in their quarrels, and when urging enlarged\r\nprivileges as a protection against the hatred which it had excited. In\r\nits appeals against the curtailment of its jurisdiction in Aragon, it\r\ndid not hesitate to admit that it had been hated there from the\r\nbeginning and that its officials were so abhorred that they would not be\r\nsafe if exposed to secular justice and, even as late as 1727, it\r\nrepeated the assertion of the persistent hostility of the\r\nAragonese.[1274] In Logroño, the inquisitors reported to the Suprema, in\r\n1584, that it was a common saying among the people that their life\r\nconsisted in discord with the tribunal and that it was death to them\r\nwhen there was peace.[1275] It was the same in Castile. The Córtes, in\r\n1566, when encouraging Philip II to constrain the Flemings to admit the\r\nInquisition, gave as a reason that his success there was necessary to\r\nthe peaceful maintenance of the institution in Spain, thus intimating\r\nthat, if the Flemings rejected it, the Castilians would seek to follow\r\ntheir example.[1276] In the same year the familiars alleged that the\r\ndetestation in which they were held led them to be singled out for\r\nespecial oppression in the billeting of troops and, in 1647, the\r\nSuprema declared that nothing seemed sufficient to repress the hatred\r\nwith which they were regarded, in support of which it instanced an\r\nunjust apportionment, in Cuenca, of an assessment of a forced\r\nloan.[1277] This hostility continued to the last, even though the\r\ndecadence of the Inquisition in the eighteenth century diminished so\r\ngreatly its powers of oppression. A defender of the institution, in\r\n1803, commences by deprecating the hatred which had pursued it from the\r\nbeginning; even in the present age, he says, of greater enlightenment,\r\nthere is crass ignorance of its essential principles and a mortal\r\nopposition to its existence.[1278]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus, notwithstanding the Spanish abhorrence of Jews and heretics, the\r\ndread which the Inquisition inspired was largely mingled with\r\ndetestation, arising from its abuse of its privileges in matters wholly\r\napart from its functions as the guardian of the faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nLIST OF TRIBUNALS.\r\n\r\nThe permanent tribunals of the Spanish Inquisition were Toledo, Seville,\r\nValladolid, Corte (Madrid), Granada, Córdova, Murcia, Llerena, Cuenca,\r\nSantiago (Galicia), Logroño and Canaries, under the crown of Castile,\r\nand Saragossa, Valencia, Barcelona and Majorca under the crown of\r\nAragon. In addition were Sicily, Sardinia, Mexico, Lima and Cartagena de\r\nlas Indias, which lie beyond the scope of the present work.\r\n\r\nThis distribution of the forces of the Inquisition was not reached until\r\nexperience had shown the most effective centres of action. Numerous more\r\nor less temporary tribunals were erected and many changes occurred in\r\nthe apportionment of territory. The following list makes no pretension\r\nto absolute completeness but contains the result of such allusions as I\r\nhave met in the documents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALCARAZ. For some years there was a tribunal fixed at Alcaraz. In 1495\r\nAlonso Hernandez, presented for a canonry, is qualified as Inquisitor of\r\nAlcaraz and, in 1499, Alonso de Torres is appointed as inquisitor\r\nthere.[1279]\r\n\r\nARMY AND NAVY. The fleet organized for the Catholic League which won at\r\nLepanto seemed to require a tribunal to preserve it from heresy and\r\nPhilip II procured from Pius V a brief of July 23, 1571, authorizing the\r\ninquisitor-general to appoint an inquisitor for each army of Philip II,\r\nwhether by land or sea.[1280] The first appointment under this seems to\r\nhave been Rodrigo de Mendoza, Inquisitor of Barcelona, whose commission\r\nas _Inquisidor de las Galeras_ is dated March 21, 1575, together with\r\none for his notary, Domingo de Leon, and instructions as to his\r\nduties.[1281] He was succeeded by Gerónimo Manrique, who celebrated an\r\nauto de fe in Messina. After him was Doctor Juan Bautista de Cardona,\r\nbut merely as commissioner, who served for two years, when Páramo,\r\nwriting in 1598; tells us that the fleets were scattered and the office\r\nceased to exist.[1282] If so, it was revived for, in 1622, we are told\r\nthat Fray Martin de Vivanco, chaplain of the galleys of Sicily, was\r\nappointed _Inquisidor del Mar_ and, in 1632, it is stated that when a\r\n_Principe del Mar_ was appointed he took with him an inquisitor and\r\nofficials and all prisoners arrested by them were delivered to the\r\nnearest tribunal when the galleys made port.[1283]\r\n\r\nIn later times the inquisitor-general was \"Vicario géneral de los Reales\r\nEjercitos de Mar y Tierra\" and as such appointed sub-delegates to\r\naccompany the army, with the necessary powers. The _jurisdiccion\r\ncastrense_ enjoyed by military men did not exempt them in matters of\r\nfaith from the Inquisition, but the _subdelegados castrenses_ seem to\r\nhave possessed no judicial powers, and debate arose, in 1793 and again\r\nin 1806, whether they or the episcopal Ordinaries should be called in to\r\nvote with the inquisitors in the cases of soldiers.[1284]\r\n\r\nAVILA. When Torquemada built his convent of San Tomas in Avila he\r\nprovided accommodations for an Inquisition and, in 1590, the prisoners\r\naccused of the murder of the Santo Niño de la Guardia were transferred\r\nthither from the tribunal of Segovia for trial. It continued to exist\r\nfor some years and had connection with Segovia, for, June 9, 1499,\r\nFrancisco González of Fresneda and Juan de Monasterio were appointed\r\ninquisitors of Avila and Segovia, residing sometimes in one city and\r\nsometimes in the other.[1285]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TRIBUNALS_]\r\n\r\nBALAGUER. There were autos de fe celebrated in Balaguer, August 15, 1490\r\nand June 10, 1493, but these were held by the inquisitors of Barcelona\r\nas they did in Tarragona, Gerona, Perpignan and other places in their\r\ndistrict. In 1517, however, there would seem to be a tribunal there for\r\na letter of the Suprema relates to the murder of the assessor of the\r\nInquisition of Balaguer. If so, it was probably withdrawn in consequence\r\nfor, in 1518, the inquisitors of Barcelona are ordered to publish\r\nedicts against those who molest the clergy of Balaguer for observing the\r\ninterdict cast upon the town.[1286]\r\n\r\nBARBASTRO. As early as 1488 there was a tribunal with inquisitors at\r\nBarbastro, but, in 1521, it was suppressed and incorporated with\r\nSaragossa.[1287]\r\n\r\nBARCELONA. Established in 1486. It claimed jurisdiction over the free\r\nRepublic of Andorra, which was included by Arevalo de Zuazo in his\r\nvisitation of 1595. Long after Roussillon and Cerdagne had been\r\nretroceded to France, the Barcelona inquisitors in 1695 still styled\r\nthemselves \"Inquisidores Apostólicos ... en el Principado de Cataluña y\r\nsu partido, con los Condados do Rosellon y Cerdaña y los Valls de Aran y\r\nAndorra.\"[1288] See LÉRIDA, TARRAGONA, TORTOSA, BALAGUER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURGOS. There was originally a tribunal in Burgos but, in the\r\nredistricting by Ximenes it was included in Valladolid. In 1605, Philip\r\nIII transferred the tribunal to Burgos, with orders to the inquisitors\r\nto eject any occupants of buildings that they might find suited to their\r\npurposes. In 1622 it was still rendering yearly reports of cases to the\r\nSuprema but, probably about 1630, it returned to Valladolid. When, in\r\n1706, Madrid was captured by the Allies under Galloway and Las Minas,\r\nthe court fled to Burgos, carrying the Inquisition thither, but its stay\r\nwas short and it soon returned to the capital.[1289]\r\n\r\nCADIZ. See XERES.\r\n\r\nCALAHORRA. A tribunal was established here as early as 1493, when it\r\ncelebrated an auto at Logroño. In 1499 it alternated between Calahorra\r\nand Durango. In the redistricting by Ximenes in 1509 it was incorporated\r\nwith Durango, but was soon re-established. Cédulas of 1516, 1517, and\r\n1520 indicate that at this time it was the tribunal of the enormous\r\ndistrict of Valladolid, but in 1522 the Inquisition of Navarre was\r\nextended over Calahorra; then Navarre and Calahorra were separated, but\r\nin 1540 there was a redistribution, and Navarre and the Basque Provinces\r\nwere added to Calahorra. In 1560 a part of the territory of Burgos was\r\nset off from Valladolid and added to Calahorra and, in 1570, the seat of\r\nthe tribunal was definitely moved to Logroño, _q. v._[1290]\r\n\r\nCALATAYUD. Calatayud was the seat of an intermittent tribunal at least\r\nfrom the year 1488 for, in 1502, Ferdinand speaks of Joan de Aguaviva\r\nwho for fourteen years had served it as barber-surgeon whenever it\r\nresided in Calatayud and one of the first presentations to a prebend, in\r\n1488, was Martin Márquez, described as fiscal of the Inquisition of\r\nCalatayud. A letter of the Suprema, Jan. 22, 1519, addressed to the\r\n\"Inquisitor of Calatayud\" shows that it was still in existence, but it\r\nmust soon afterwards have been merged into Saragossa.[1291]\r\n\r\nCANARIES. The zeal of Diego de Muros, Bishop of Canaries, did not wait\r\nfor the extension of the Spanish Inquisition over his diocese, but led\r\nhim to establish an episcopal one by proclamation of April 28, 1499. It\r\nwas not until 1504 that Inquisitor-general Deza sent Bartolomé López de\r\nTribaldos thither to establish a tribunal at Las Palmas, which seems to\r\nhave commenced business Oct. 28, 1505. It continued thus to the\r\nend.[1292]\r\n\r\nCARTAGENA. See MURCIA.\r\n\r\nCIUDAD REAL. A letter of Ferdinand, Nov. 8, 1483, announces the\r\nappointment of Licenciados Costana and de Balthasar as inquisitors for\r\nCiudad Real. May 10, 1485, Ferdinand announces the transfer of Costana\r\nto Toledo, to which place the tribunal was removed.[1293]\r\n\r\nCÓRDOVA. A tribunal was established in Córdova as early as 1482, at the\r\ninstance of its bishop, the New Christian Alonso de Burgos. Its district\r\ncomprised the bishoprics of Córdova and Jaen, the Abadía de Alcalá la\r\nReal, the Adelantamiento of Cazorla, with Ecija and Estepa, to which\r\nGranada was added after the conquest.[1294] See GRANADA and JAEN.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TRIBUNALS_]\r\n\r\nCORTE. The tribunal of Madrid was technically known as _Corte_. Madrid,\r\noriginally a town of no special importance, belonged to the province of\r\nToledo and was naturally under the jurisdiction of its tribunal. As the\r\nroyal residence under Philip II and eventually the capital of the\r\nkingdom (except during the brief transfer to Valladolid, 1600-1606) it\r\nfurnished a large part of the business of Toledo. Toledan inquisitors\r\ncame there to make investigations and even to try cases, of which we\r\nhave examples in 1590 and 1592.[1295] Something more than this was felt\r\nto be needed and the Suprema adopted the plan of calling inquisitors\r\nfrom other places to commence prosecutions and act under its\r\ninstructions, of which the Licenciado Flores, Inquisitor of Murcia, in\r\n1593, and Cifontes de Loarte, Inquisitor of Granada, in 1615, are\r\nexamples.[1296] The presence of the inquisitor-general who did not\r\nhesitate to take action in emergencies, and that of an experienced\r\ncommissioner, together with the frequent sojourn of one of the Toledo\r\ninquisitors enabled speedy action to be taken when requisite, as\r\noccurred in 1621 and again in 1624 and seemed to render superfluous the\r\norganization of a special tribunal.[1297]\r\n\r\nYet the want of it was felt, especially with the influx of Portuguese\r\nNew Christians who multiplied in the capital. As the pressure increased\r\nToledo furnished two assistant inquisitors to reside in Madrid, thus\r\nestablishing a kind of subordinate court, but in 1637 it was reported\r\nthat the establishment of a tribunal was positively resolved upon, with\r\nthe added comment that this would sorely vex the Toledans.[1298] To\r\ntheir natural opposition is doubtless to be attributed the postponement\r\nof what, to a Spaniard of the period, would seem a necessity to the\r\ncapital. It cannot have been long after this that one was organized for,\r\nin the matter of the confiscation of Juan Cote, commenced in Toledo, we\r\nfind it, September 10, 1640, sitting in Madrid, with Francisco Salgado\r\nand Juan Adam de la Parra as inquisitors. In the same year they\r\nsuggested that the case of Benito de Valdepeñas, on which they were\r\nengaged, should be sent to Toledo as more convenient for the witnesses,\r\nwhich was accordingly done.[1299] Toledan influence is doubtless\r\nresponsible for the action of Arce y Reynoso, soon after his accession\r\nin 1643, in suppressing the new tribunal and restoring the business to\r\nToledo.[1300] The pressure, however, became too great and Arce y Reynoso\r\nwas obliged to reverse his action. The date of the re-establishment may\r\nsafely be assumed as 1650, for a list of penitents, reconciled by Corte\r\nfrom the beginning, starts with three in 1651 and their trials can\r\nscarce have been commenced later than 1650.[1301] Yet the relations\r\nbetween Toledo and Madrid continued intimate; in 1657, Lorenzo de\r\nSotomayor styles himself as \"Inquisidor Apostólico de la Inquisicion de\r\nla Ciudad y Reyno de Toledo y asistente de Corte;\" to the end of the\r\ncentury the former always alluded to Corte as a _despacho_ or office and\r\nnot as a tribunal, and Corte seems to have sent its convicts to Toledo\r\nfor their sentences to be published in the autos de fe.[1302] Its\r\njurisdiction was strictly limited to the city, while the surrounding\r\ncountry remained with Toledo. In some respects its organization was\r\npeculiar. About 1750 we are informed that its inquisitors were drawn\r\nfrom other tribunals who continued them on their pay-rolls, their places\r\nbeing taken by appointees who served without salary until a vacancy\r\noccurred. Selection to serve in Corte was regarded as a promotion,\r\nleading to a place in the Suprema or to a bishopric, although the\r\nincumbent drew only the salary from his former tribunal with a Christmas\r\n_propina_ of a hundred ducats. It had no receiver; the Suprema paid its\r\nexpenses and presumably collected its fines and confiscations.[1303]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TRIBUNALS_]\r\n\r\nCUENCA. Murcia and Cuenca were originally under one tribunal. Some\r\ntrouble apparently arose, possibly connected with the episcopal\r\nOrdinaries, for Ximenes ordered, January 22, 1512, that cases\r\noriginating in Murcia should be taken to Cuenca to be voted on and vice\r\nversa. Llorente says that in 1513 they were separated and Cuenca formed\r\nan independent tribunal, but documents as late as 1519 show them still\r\nconnected, until, in 1520, we find Cuenca celebrating an auto. A letter\r\nof March 7, 1522, states that the pope has given to Cuenca the see of\r\nSigüenza, without taking it from Toledo, because Toledo has never\r\nvisited it although ordered to do so, and is not to do so in future.\r\nThen, May 31, 1533, the Suprema says that Toledo can exercise\r\njurisdiction there without giving Cuenca cause of complaint, and, in\r\n1560, Sigüenza was restored to Toledo, yet in 1584 we find Cuenca\r\nexercising jurisdiction as far north as Soria. There would seem to have\r\nbeen some connection maintained between Murcia and Cuenca for, in 1746,\r\nthe former, in enumerating its personnel, specifies nine calificadores\r\nin Murcia and four in Cuenca.[1304]\r\n\r\nDAROCA. There would appear to have been for a time a tribunal in Daroca\r\nfor, in the accounts of Juan Royz, receiver of Aragon, for 1498 there is\r\nan item of expenditure on the prison of the Inquisition there, which was\r\nduly passed.[1305]\r\n\r\nDURANGO. See CALAHORRA. As defined by Ximenes, in 1509, Durango had\r\njurisdiction over Biscay, Guipúzcoa, Alava and Calahorra, with some\r\nneighboring districts.[1306]\r\n\r\nESTELLA. See NAVARRE.\r\n\r\nGALICIA, also known as SANTIAGO. The earliest allusion to this tribunal\r\noccurs in a commission issued at Coruña, May 20, 1520, to Doctor Gonzalo\r\nMaldonado as Inquisitor of Santiago. It was probably some time before\r\nthe tribunal was in working order but in 1527 it had caused sufficient\r\nalarm for the Suprema to write to João III of Portugal asking for the\r\narrest and surrender of those who had fled from it and, in the same\r\nyear, a warrant for three hundred ducats was drawn to be distributed\r\namong the inquisitors and officials of the Inquisition of Galicia. This\r\nwas followed by a similar payment in 1528, showing that the tribunal was\r\nnot self-sustaining.[1307] Apparently the harvest was scanty and the\r\ntribunal was allowed to lapse, until the scare about Protestantism\r\ncalled attention to the ports of the North-west as affording ingress to\r\nheretics and their books, for we hear nothing more about it until 1562,\r\nwhen Philip II, in letters of June 2nd and 26th informs the governor and\r\nofficials of Galicia that Valdés had despatched Dr. Quixano there as\r\ninquisitor; they are no longer to prosecute cases of heresy as they have\r\nbeen doing but are to lend him all aid and favor and are to allow him to\r\ndispose as he pleases of the seats in his public functions, without\r\ndisputes as to precedence. In 1566 we hear of Bartolomé de Leon as\r\nreceiver there, which would indicate that it was at work and was making\r\ncollections.[1308] Still, it had a struggle for existence, for it was\r\ndiscontinued early in 1568, but it was re-established within a few\r\nyears, if Llorente is correct in saying that its first auto de fe was\r\ncelebrated in 1573. A letter of Dr. Alva, its inquisitor, October 31,\r\n1577, speaks of having, in the previous year, sentenced Guillaume le\r\nMeunier, he being the only inquisitor, with the advice of a single\r\nconsultor, showing that the tribunal was sparingly equipped.[1309] In\r\nlater years it became one of the active tribunals of the kingdom. Its\r\ndistrict comprised Coruña, Pontevedro, Orense and Lugo.\r\n\r\nGRANADA. Granada, after its capture, was included in the inquisitorial\r\ndistrict of Córdova until, in 1526, the tribunal of Jaen was transferred\r\nthither.[1310]\r\n\r\nGUADALUPE. A temporary tribunal was organized here in 1485 which during\r\nits brief existence was exceedingly efficient (see p. 171).\r\n\r\nHUESCA. See LÉRIDA.\r\n\r\nJACA. A tribunal apparently existed here, which was annexed to Saragossa\r\nin 1521.[1311]\r\n\r\nJAEN. A tribunal must have been established here about 1483, for two of\r\nits inquisitors took part in the assembly of Seville which framed the\r\nInstructions of 1484. It seems to have been discontinued, for September\r\n2, 1501, Ferdinand ordered a certain Doña Beatrix of Jaen to abandon her\r\nhouse to the inquisitors sent thither, and to seek other quarters until\r\nthey should finish the business that took them there. This indicates\r\nthat only a temporary tribunal was intended but the situation was\r\nconveniently central and it was one of those retained by Ximenes in his\r\nreorganization of 1509, when he assigned to it the districts of Jaen and\r\nGuadix, with Alcaraz, Cazorla and Beas. It was still in existence in\r\n1525, as shown by a royal letter of that date, but in 1526 it was\r\nsuppressed and united with Córdova, the tribunal being transferred to\r\nGranada. In 1547, the official title of the tribunal was Córdoba y Jaen.\r\nRodrigo tells us that it was re-established independently in 1545, but\r\nthis is evidently an error and the name does not reappear in subsequent\r\nlists of tribunals.[1312]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TRIBUNALS_]\r\n\r\nLEON. In 1501 we hear of \"inquisitors of the province of Leon,\" whose\r\ndistrict cannot have been confined to that province, for Ferdinand,\r\nwriting September 2nd to \"Cousin Duke\" tells him that they have occasion\r\nto go to his city of Coria (Extremadura) and asks that they may occupy\r\nhis house while there. In 1514, also there is allusion to the receiver\r\nand alguazil of the Inquisition of Leon.[1313] Apparently the term is a\r\nsynonym of the tribunal of Valladolid.\r\n\r\nLÉRIDA. The provinces of Huesca in Aragon and Lérida and Urgel in\r\nCatalonia were united as an inquisitorial district at least as early as\r\n1490, when we hear of \"the inquisitors of Huesca and Lérida\" taking\r\ntestimony. In 1498, a letter of Ferdinand, October 8th, announces the\r\ntransfer of Urgel to Barcelona. Allusions to the tribunal continue to\r\noccur in the correspondence of Ferdinand, who, in 1502, called away the\r\ninquisitor, as there was so little to do; Saragossa would attend to\r\nheresy and only the financial officials need be left. It was not\r\ndiscontinued however. In 1514, there was an attempt to murder the\r\ninquisitor, Canon Antist, but in 1519 he is still addressed as\r\ninquisitor of Lérida. In this same year, however, Charles V, in a letter\r\nof January 22nd, speaks of the tribunals of Huesca, Tarazona and Lérida\r\nhaving been united with that of Saragossa, and, when the people of\r\nHuesca complained, in the Córtes of Saragossa, of their citizens being\r\ncarried away for trial, he ordered, under pain of a thousand florins,\r\nthat no one should interfere with the jurisdiction of the Saragossa\r\ntribunal. October 9th an inspector reported that there was no need of a\r\nreceiver or other officials there, whereupon they were all dismissed. In\r\n1532, however, the inquisitors of Saragossa undertook to appoint a\r\nreceiver for Lérida, but were told by the Suprema to cancel it as this\r\nwas a function of the crown.[1314]\r\n\r\nLOGROÑO. In 1570, as we have seen, the tribunal of Calahorra was shifted\r\nto Logroño, which, in 1690, defines its territory as the whole kingdom\r\nof Navarre, the bishopric of Calahorra and la Calzada, Biscay,\r\nGuipuzcoa, Burgos along the mountains of Oca and the sea-coast as far as\r\nSan Vicente de la Barquera, thus comprising the modern provinces of\r\nNavarre, Guipuzcoa, Biscay, Santander, Alava, Logroño and a large part\r\nof Burgos.[1315]\r\n\r\nLLERENA. Originally Extremadura and Leon were combined. In 1500, Enrique\r\nPaez is receiver for the sees of Plasencia, Coria and Badajoz and the\r\nProvince of Leon. In 1509 Ximenes assigned to Llerena as its district,\r\nPlasencia, Coria, Badajoz and the lands of the military Orders, but as\r\nlate as 1516 it is spoken of as the Inquisition of Leon, Plasencia,\r\nCoria and Badajoz. Its original seat was Llerena but, in 1516, it was\r\ntransferred to Plasencia and the receiver was ordered to sell the houses\r\npurchased at Llerena for the prison because others will be wanted for\r\nthe purpose at Plasencia. It was migratory, however and, in 1520, the\r\npeople of Ciudad Rodrigo, Coria and Merida were notified that it was\r\nabout to leave Plasencia and wherever it went accommodations must be\r\nprovided for lodgement, audience chamber and prisons. Finally it settled\r\npermanently at Llerena and, towards the close of the sixteenth century,\r\nZapata speaks of it as the first tribunal of the kingdom, with the\r\nwidest jurisdiction.[1316]\r\n\r\nMADRID. See CORTE.\r\n\r\nMEDINA DEL CAMPO. The great importance of Medina del Campo as a centre\r\nof trade rendered inevitable its selection as the seat of a tribunal at\r\nan early period. In 1486 it was fully furnished with three inquisitors\r\nand an assessor, the Abbot of Medina serving as Ordinary. In 1516 we\r\nfind it incorporated with Valladolid. When the court moved to\r\nValladolid, the buildings of the Inquisition were wanted for its\r\naccommodation and the tribunal, in June 1601, was unceremoniously sent\r\nto Medina, where Dr. Martin de Bustos was turned out of his house to\r\nlodge it. Its stay was short, for in 1605, as we have seen, it was\r\ntransferred to Burgos and there is no later trace of a tribunal at\r\nMedina.[1317]\r\n\r\nMURCIA, also known as CARTAGENA. See also CUENCA. Murcia was a seat of\r\none of the early tribunals, comprising the sees of Murcia and Cartagena.\r\nCuenca, which was attached to it in the redistribution by Ximenes in\r\n1509, was separated about 1520. Oran, some time after its conquest by\r\nXimenes, was placed under the jurisdiction of Murcia. The see of\r\nOrihuela, although belonging to Valencia, on its suppression about 1510,\r\nwas united to that of Cartagena and thus fell under the tribunal of\r\nMurcia, where it remained after the restoration to episcopal honors in\r\n1564.[1318] The tribunal of Orihuela naturally followed the same course\r\non its suppression.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TRIBUNALS_]\r\n\r\nNAVARRE. After the conquest of Navarre, in 1512, a tribunal was\r\nestablished in Pampeluna, where it did not long remain. Then, for a\r\nshort period it was transferred to Estella. In 1515 we find it in\r\nTudela, where Ferdinand orders the Archdeacon of Almazan to visit it as\r\nit is in much need of reform and, soon afterwards, he asks for a\r\ndelegation of episcopal power, as Tudela was only a deanery. It was\r\nquartered in the convent of San Francisco, to relieve which, in 1518,\r\nthe Suprema ordered appropriate buildings to be obtained. In 1521 and\r\n1522 there was talk of removing it to Pampeluna; then it was extended\r\nover Calahorra; soon afterwards they were separated but finally, in\r\n1540, they were united and so remained. Soon after the transfer to\r\nLogroño we find the tribunal describing itself as \"en todo el Reyno de\r\nNavarra, Obispado de Calahorra y la Calzada y su distrito.\"[1319]\r\n\r\nNAVY. See ARMY.\r\n\r\nORAN. Páramo tells us that when Ximenes conquered Oran he commissioned\r\nFray Yedra as inquisitor there. Llorente places this in 1516 and calls\r\nthe inquisitor Martin de Baydacar, Ximenes's provisor. At that time,\r\nhowever, there could have been no tribunal there for, July 9, 1516 the\r\nGovernor Lope Hurtado de Mendoza was ordered to discover and punish\r\nthose who were impeding the sale of property for the Inquisition, work\r\nwhich would have been entrusted to the tribunal had there been one. By\r\nthis time it had probably been suppressed and placed under Murcia.[1320]\r\n\r\nORIHUELA. According to Llorente, Ferdinand, Aug. 7, 1507, united the\r\ntribunal of the bishopric of Orihuela to Valencia, which would infer its\r\nprevious existence. It was reorganized in 1515, when Bishop Mercader\r\nappointed Pedro de los Rios as inquisitor and he was sent there with a\r\nstaff of officials, and the magistrates were ordered to provide quarters\r\nfor \"el tiempo que fuere menester.\" This indicates that the tribunal was\r\nnot expected to be permanent and it was probably not long afterwards\r\nthat it was united with Murcia, _q. v._[1321]\r\n\r\nOSUNA. In 1488, among the presentations to prebends is one of Pedro\r\nSánchez, qualified as Inquisitor of Osuna.[1322] Such tribunal can only\r\nhave been short-lived and must speedily have been incorporated with that\r\nof Seville.\r\n\r\nPAMPELUNA. See NAVARRE.\r\n\r\nPERPIGNAN. August 9, 1495 an auto de fe was celebrated in Perpignan, but\r\nit was held by the inquisitors of Barcelona. In 1518 there was only a\r\ncommissioner there but, in 1524, there was a tribunal, with Juan Navardu\r\nas inquisitor and Antonio Saliteda as secretary. It was not permanent\r\nhowever. In 1566, when de Soto Salazar was sent on his visitation to\r\nBarcelona he was instructed to ascertain and report promptly details for\r\nthe benefit of the inquisitor about to be sent to Perpignan to reside\r\nfor the future and what officials should be provided for him. It is\r\ndoubtful whether this intention was carried out; in any event it was but\r\ntransitory.[1323]\r\n\r\nPLASENCIA. See LLERENA.\r\n\r\nSANTIAGO. See GALICIA.\r\n\r\nSARAGOSSA. Established in 1484, the tribunal gradually absorbed all the\r\nminor tribunals, but parted with Teruel to Valencia. See BARBASTRO,\r\nCALATAYUD, DAROCA, JACA, LÉRIDA, TARAZONA, TERUEL.\r\n\r\nSEGOVIA. Segovia claimed the honor of being among the earliest cities,\r\nafter Seville, to possess a tribunal, but there was no representative\r\nfrom there among the inquisitors assembled to frame the Instructions of\r\n1484, owing doubtless to the resistance of the bishop Juan Arias\r\nDávila.[1324] One must have been established soon afterwards for, in\r\n1490, the prisoners accused of the murder of the Santo Niño de la\r\nGuardia were on trial there when Torquemada transferred them to Avila.\r\n(See AVILA.) In the redistribution by Ximenes, in 1509, Segovia was\r\nincorporated with Valladolid, but, in 1544 and again in 1599, the\r\ninquisitors of Toledo include it in their enumeration of their\r\njurisdictions.[1325]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TRIBUNALS_]\r\n\r\nSIGÜENZA. A tribunal was early established in Sigüenza which must have\r\nbeen busy if we may believe the statement that at an auto de fe in 1494\r\nit relaxed a hundred and forty-nine victims to the secular arm. In\r\n1506, Deza dismissed the officials for the reason that it was about to\r\nbe united with Toledo, a merger ratified by Ximines in 1509. Toledo\r\nneglected it and it was transferred to Cuenca, _q. v._ In the eighteenth\r\ncentury there would appear to be some kind of subordinate tribunal\r\nthere, for about 1750, Saragossa, in a report of its personnel, states\r\nthat one of its five inquisitors is assisting at Sigüenza.[1326]\r\n\r\nTARAZONA. A tribunal established here in the early period was merged\r\ninto that of Saragossa in 1519.[1327]\r\n\r\nTARRAGONA. When, in 1643, the inquisitors of Barcelona were ejected,\r\nthey were, after some delay, sent to open their tribunal at Tarragona,\r\nwhere they remained until the suppression of the Catalan rebellion in\r\n1652.[1328]\r\n\r\nTERUEL. In 1485 a tribunal was established in Teruel after some\r\nresistance. At what time it was transferred to Valencia does not appear,\r\nbut a cédula of October 2, 1502 is addressed to the inquisitors of\r\nValencia residing in Teruel and Albarracin, showing that it was then\r\nsubordinate to Valencia. In 1518 it was discontinued and the district\r\nwas subjected to the direct jurisdiction of the Valencian tribunal, but\r\nCardinal Adrian, by a provision of Nov. 21st of the same year,\r\ntransferred it to Saragossa and then, March 3, 1519 restored it to\r\nValencia. This was felt by Aragon as a grievance and, at the Córtes of\r\nMonzon, in 1533 it asked that Teruel and Albarracin should be restored\r\nto the Saragossa tribunal, but the request was peremptorily refused and\r\nthey remained subject to Valencia.[1329]\r\n\r\nTOLEDO. In 1485 the tribunal of Ciudad Real was transferred to Toledo.\r\nAt first the limits of its district seem not to be clearly defined for,\r\nin 1489 the inquisitors were told to go to Guadalajara and Ferdinand\r\nordered the local authorities to show them favor and allow them to make\r\narrests. See CORTE, CUENCA, SEGOVIA, SIGÜENZA, VALLADOLID for sundry\r\nchanges in its district. In 1565 the official designation is the city\r\nand archbishopric of Toledo, the city and bishopric of Sigüenza and the\r\nbishoprics of Avila and Segovia, which apparently remained permanent,\r\nexcept the detachment of Madrid.[1330]\r\n\r\nTORTOSA. For some reason the bishopric of Tortosa, although part of\r\nCatalonia, was subject to the tribunal of Valencia. When, in 1697,\r\nVendôme captured Barcelona, the tribunal emigrated to Tortosa and\r\nestablished itself in the Colegio Imperial. Although peace was declared\r\nsoon afterwards it remained in Tortosa at least until 1700 and\r\npresumably stayed until the conclusion of the War of Succession, when it\r\nwas reinstated in Barcelona in 1715.[1331]\r\n\r\nTUDELA. See NAVARRE.\r\n\r\nVALENCIA. The old Inquisition of Valencia was reorganized in 1484, and\r\ncontinued to the end. As seen above, it parted with Orihuela to Murcia,\r\nobtaining Teruel and Albarracin from Saragossa and Tortosa from\r\nBarcelona.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TRIBUNALS_]\r\n\r\nVALLADOLID. A tribunal was assigned to Valladolid in 1485, but did not\r\nget into working order until 1488. After this it was suspended to be\r\nrevived in 1499, as appears from a letter of Isabella, Dec. 24, 1498.\r\nThe northern provinces of Spain were comparatively free from heresy and\r\nXimenes, in his reorganization of 1509, assigned to Valladolid the\r\nenormous district comprising the sees of Burgos, Osma, Palencia,\r\nSegovia, Avila, Salamanca, Zamora, Leon, Oviedo and Astorga and the\r\nabbeys of Valladolid, Medina del Campo and Sahagun. In 1516 the\r\nenumeration is the same except the omission of Zamora and the addition\r\nof Ciudad Rodrigo and Calahorra. Roughly speaking, it may be assumed to\r\ncomprise the whole of the provinces of Old Castile, Leon and Asturias.\r\nValdés, August 8, 1560, repeated April 12, 1562 made over the whole of\r\nthis to Toledo, but the grant can only have been temporary for, in 1565\r\nthe Toledan inquisitors described themselves as of the city and\r\narchbishoprics of Toledo, the city and bishopric of Sigüenza, with the\r\nbishoprics of Avila and Segovia, and in 1579 we find the inquisitors of\r\nValladolid styling themselves inquisitors of the kingdoms of Castile and\r\nLeon and the principality of Asturias. This enormous district it\r\ncontinued to retain, subject to the easternmost portion detached to\r\nCalahorra or Logroño and to its translation in 1601 to Medina del Campo\r\nand thence to Burgos, from which it returned to Valladolid, probably\r\nabout 1630.[1332]\r\n\r\nXERES. In 1495, Rodrigo Lucero is described as Inquisitor of Xeres. In\r\n1499 the sovereigns appointed Alonso de Guevara Inquisitor of Cadiz and\r\nXeres. The tribunal continued there for some time. In 1515 Ferdinand\r\nalludes to Luis de Riba Martin \"our late receiver in the Inquisition of\r\nXeres,\" who in dying had left to the treasury a legacy of 30,000 mrs.\r\nfor the relief of his conscience.[1333] I have met no later reference to\r\nit and probably it was soon afterwards merged into the tribunal of\r\nSeville.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nLIST OF INQUISITORS-GENERAL.\r\n\r\n     1483.

The subject is complicated, after the middle\r\nof the sixteenth century, by the progressive but fluctuating\r\ndepreciation in the _moneda de vellón_, or base coinage, which became\r\npractically the standard of value in all transactions.\r\n\r\nThe monetary unit of Castile was the _maravedí_, anciently a gold coin\r\nof value but, in the fifteenth century, diminished to a fraction of its\r\nformer estimation. A declaration of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1503 says\r\nthat formerly the silver real was equal to 3 maravedís, but now it is\r\nworth 34.[1334]\r\n\r\nThe unit of weight was the marc, or half-pound, of 8 ounces or 4608\r\ngrains. The intermediate weights were the _ochavo_ of 72 grains, the\r\n_adarme_ of 36 and the _tomin_ of 12. These were applicable to all the\r\nprecious metals but, up to 1731, the marc of gold was reckoned to\r\ncontain 50 _castellanos_ of 8 _tomines_, making 4800 grains, whereby the\r\ngrain was reduced 1/25.\r\n\r\nThe standard of fineness was fixed, by Ferdinand and Isabella, for gold\r\nat 23-3/4 carats, but was reduced by Charles V to 22 carats, at which it\r\nremained. For silver the standard maintained since the fourteenth\r\ncentury was known as _once dineros cuatro granos_ (pure silver being\r\n_doce dineros_) equivalent to .925 fine. In 1709 Philip V reduced it to\r\n_once dineros_ or .91667, and in some mintages even lower.\r\n\r\nGOLD COINS. When Ferdinand and Isabella revised the coinage, in 1497,\r\nthey ordered the marc to be worked into 65-1/3 _excelentes de la\r\ngranada_. This coin was worth 374 maravedís and thus was practically the\r\nsame as the ducat or escudo which was rated at 374. There were also the\r\n_dobla alfonsi_ or _castellano_ or _peso de oro_, equal to 485, the\r\n_dobla de la banda_ to 365, the florin to 265. Thus the ducat, which was\r\nthe coin most frequently quoted, was equivalent to 11 silver reales. The\r\nratio between gold and silver fluctuated between 7 and 8 to 1.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SPANISH COINAGE_]\r\n\r\nIn 1537 Charles V ordered _coronas_ and _escudos_, 22 carats fine to be\r\nworked 68 to the marc and to be worth 330 maravedís, which he says was\r\nthe weight and fineness of the best crowns of Italy and France. With the\r\nprogressive depreciation in the value of silver, the coinage law of\r\nPhilip II in 1566 raised the escudo from 330 mrs. to 400. The old ducats\r\nwere to be current at 429 mrs., the castellanos at 544. The tendency of\r\nsilver continued downward and in 1609 Philip III permitted the escudo to\r\npass for 440 mrs., threatening three years' exile and a fine of 500\r\nducats for asking or receiving more. In 1612 he allowed the castellano\r\nin bullion to be sold for 576 mrs. under the same penalties for\r\nexceeding it. The escudo or crown remained the standard gold coin. In\r\n1642 it was raised to 550 mrs.; in 1643 to 612 and then reduced to 510\r\nowing to variations in the silver and vellón coinage. In 1651 it is\r\nrated at 16 silver reales, in 1652 at 14, in 1686 at 15, but with a new\r\ncoinage of lighter weight silver it was raised to 19, and the _doblon_,\r\nor piece of 2 escudos, to 40 reales. For larger transactions multiples\r\nof the escudo were struck, known as _doblones de a dos_, _de a cuatro_\r\nand _de a ocho_, containing respectively 2, 4 and 8 escudos. The latter,\r\nwhich became popularly known as the Spanish doubloon, were rated in 1726\r\nat 18 _pesos_ or pieces of eight silver reales, in 1728 at 16, in 1737\r\nat 15 and in 1779 at 16 again, the doubloon and the peso being virtually\r\nof the same weight, each a fraction under an ounce. In 1738, to supply\r\nthe lack of silver money there were coined half-crowns of gold, worth in\r\nvellón 18 reales 28 mrs. This fraction was troublesome and, in 1742, the\r\nweight was changed to correspond with 20 reales, and the coins became\r\nknown as _veintenos_ or _escuditos_.\r\n\r\nSILVER COINS. The silver unit was the real, which, under the coinage\r\nlaws of Ferdinand and Isabella, was worked 67 to the silver marc, of 11\r\ndineros 4 grains fine (.925), worth 34 maravedís. It long continued of\r\nthis standard but, in the financial mismanagement under Philip IV, the\r\nweight was reduced by ordering the marc worked into 83 reales and 1\r\nquartillo (83-1/4 reales), the old coinage in circulation being advanced\r\n25 per cent. in value by making the peso equivalent to 10 reales instead\r\nof 8, but as this failed to afford the expected relief it was suspended\r\nin 1643, to be again tried in 1684 when the real was reduced to 84 to\r\nthe marc, and the old coinage was rated at 10 to 8 of the new. In 1709\r\nwe first hear of the _peseta_, as a name applied to the French coin\r\nintroduced by the War of Succession, rated at 2 reales, and subsequently\r\nused to denote the double real of Spanish mintage. At the same time the\r\nstandard was reduced to 11 dineros or .91667 fine. During the subsequent\r\nyears of the reign of Philip V the variations in the silver coinage were\r\nnumerous and perplexing. The peso, escudo de plata, or piece of 8\r\nreales, was the leading coin, and in 1726 it was ordered that it,\r\nwhether minted in the Indies or in Spain, should be current for 9-1/2\r\nreales, and, as this did not bring it to an equivalent with gold, in\r\n1728 it was declared equal to 10 reales. This however was now confined\r\nto the mintage of the Indies, which came to be known as _plata\r\nnacional_; the small coinage of the Spanish mints was termed\r\n_provincial_ and was allowed to remain current at a discount of 20 per\r\ncent. It was 77 reales to the marc and the fineness was only 10 dineros,\r\nreduced in 1728 to 9 dineros, 22 grains or .798 fine, rendering it in\r\nreality only about three-quarters the value of the standard. There were\r\nthus two entirely distinct silver currencies coexistent, and to these\r\nwas added a third, popularly known as Marias--\"plata nueva que\r\nvulgarmente se llaman Marías\"--which was called in by decree of April\r\n27, 1728, but which was still in circulation in 1736. Under these\r\ncircumstances considerable circumlocution was necessary when quoting\r\nsums in silver to define the exact kind of coin meant as, for instance,\r\nin the coinage law of July 16, 1730, we are told that the allowance for\r\nexpenses to the official known as the Fiel, was \"un real de plata\r\nprovincial, valor de 16 quartos de vellón.\" In fact, as we shall see,\r\nthe debased coinage known as _vellón_ had become the real standard of\r\nfinancial transactions.\r\n\r\nIn the later periods it will simplify the appreciation of amounts\r\nrecorded to remind the reader that the _peso_, or piece of 8 reales, is\r\nthe modern dollar, and the real, or one-eighth of this, is the coin\r\nfamiliarly known of old in various parts of the United States as the\r\n\"bit,\" the \"elevenpenny bit\" shortened to \"levy,\" the ninepence or the\r\nshilling. The maravedí was 1/34 of this, or about 3/8 of one cent.\r\n\r\nIn the colonies there is frequent allusion to the _peso ensayado_ as\r\ndistinguished from the _peso de a ocho_, which I gather to be a piece\r\nworth 400 maravedís, or nearly 11-3/4 reales--a little more than a\r\nducat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SPANISH COINAGE_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SPANISH COINAGE_]\r\n\r\nVELLON COINAGE. The debased coinage known as vellón was an alloy of\r\nsilver and copper, which proved the source of unutterable confusion in\r\nSpanish finance. As we find it prescribed by Ferdinand and Isabella in\r\n1497, it is merely a token coin convenient for small transactions,\r\nconsisting of 7 grains of silver to the marc of copper, worked into 192\r\n_blancas_, the blanca being one-half of the maravedí. Complaints were\r\nmade that it was exported at a profit, so that it became scarce, and in\r\n1552 Charles V, to remedy this, reduced the silver to 5 grains. The\r\nextravagant expenditures of Philip II rendered him eager to clutch at\r\nany expedient to relieve immediate necessities and, in 1566, he adopted\r\nthe unfortunate device of issuing a _moneda de vellón rica_, with 2-1/2\r\ndineros, 2 grains (98 grains) of silver to the marc of copper, to be\r\nworked into _quartillos_, 80 to the marc (worth 1/4 real or 8-1/2\r\nmaravedís), into _quartos_, 170 to the marc (worth 4 maravedís) and\r\n_medios quartos_, 340 to the marc (worth 2 maravedís). The _blancas_ or\r\nhalf maravedís, were retained, but the silver in them was reduced to 4\r\ngrains to the marc, worked into 220 pieces. Although there do not appear\r\never to have been larger coins of vellón issued than those authorized by\r\nPhilip II the flood of this inferior money supplanted the precious\r\nmetals. It became the basis of all internal transactions and the\r\nprecious metals were reduced virtually to the position of commodities.\r\nThere was a restamping of this coinage in 1602, in which the silver was\r\nomitted, put into forced circulation at a value of 7 to 2. With all the\r\npower of Spain, backed by the treasures of the New World and wielded by\r\nan autocratic monarchy, it was impossible to maintain so vicious and\r\nartificial a currency at par, and there followed, during the seventeenth\r\ncentury, a series of the most desperate attempts to remedy the evils\r\nwhich were crippling the commerce and industry of the nation.[1335] In\r\n1619 there was a solemn promise made that no more of the pernicious\r\nstuff should be issued for twenty years--a promise only made to be\r\nbroken and renewed in 1632. In 1625, under the severest penalties, the\r\npremium on gold and silver was limited to 10 per cent., and in 1628 the\r\nnominal value was reduced one-half, but in 1636 the permissible premium\r\non silver was recognized as 25 per cent., immediately after which the\r\nvellón coinage was restamped and trebled in value. In 1640 the premium\r\nwas allowed to be 28 per cent. and in 1641 there was another restamping\r\nand the value was doubled, followed by recognizing the premium as 50 per\r\ncent. In some accounts before me of the salaries and expenses of the\r\nSupreme Council of the Inquisition, not dated, but evidently belonging\r\nto this period, the figures set down are increased when added, in one\r\ncase by 28 per cent. and in another by 50, to adjust them to the\r\ncurrency in which they were expected to be paid. In other statements\r\nsome items are specified as payable in _vellón_ and others in _plata_.\r\nIn the effort to bring the vellón to par in 1642, it was suddenly\r\nreduced to one-sixth of its current value and then, in 1643, it was\r\nraised four-fold. This resulted, in 1647, in a premium of 25 per cent.,\r\nbut when, in 1651, it was again restamped and restored to the value\r\nwhich it bore prior to 1642, the premium rose to 50 per cent. In June,\r\n1652, another attempt was made to reduce it to one-fourth, but this\r\nseems to have been a failure and in November the edict was suspended. In\r\n1660 its further issue was suspended and the experiment was again tried\r\nof an alloy containing 20 grains of silver to the marc, or about 1/230,\r\nwhich became known as _moneda de molino de vellón ligado_. This was so\r\nunsuccessful that, in 1664, its nominal value was reduced one-half and\r\nall other vellón currency was prohibited, while in February, 1680, a\r\nstill further reduction of 75 per cent. in its value was ordered and in\r\nMay its use was forbidden, it was declared to have no value as currency,\r\nand the premium of 50 per cent. was permitted as against other vellón\r\ncoins, which had still continued in circulation. This lasted for four\r\nyears, when in 1684 the _moneda de molino_ was restored to circulation\r\nwith a nominal value double that of the last reduction.[1336] With the\r\neighteenth century the pretence of alloying copper with a fraction of\r\nsilver was abandoned. In 1718 a pure copper coinage was issued and by\r\nthis time the premium on specie recognized by law had advanced to nearly\r\n100 per cent. In spite of the prohibitions to ask or receive more than\r\nthis, people were forced to pay more. Traders kept the copper coinage\r\ntied up in bags representing the larger coins and refused to furnish the\r\nlatter except at an advance.[1337] The premium gradually rose until, in\r\n1737, the _real de plata provincial_ was recognized legally as worth 2\r\nreales de vellón and the _real de plata nacional_ as worth 2-1/2.\r\nAlthough there were no coined reales de vellón, they were the standard\r\nmoney of account on which all transactions were based. In the laws\r\nregulating the mints the salaries of the officials are always stated in\r\nvellón. Thus, in 1718, the superintendent of the mint of Madrid has\r\n24,000 reales de vellón, the treasurer 16,000, and so forth. In 1728 the\r\nsuperintendent is allowed 500 escudos de vellón, the contador 400, etc.\r\nIn 1730 it is provided that the sum of 120,000 reales de vellón is to be\r\nplaced in the hands of the treasurer for current expenses and he is to\r\ngive security in 20,000 ducados de vellón on unencumbered real estate.\r\nFrom this it follows that, when the kind of coin is not specified, there\r\nmay be some difficulty in estimating the value of a sum of money\r\nmentioned. The difference between silver and vellón went on increasing.\r\nIn 1772, when a new coinage of gold and silver was issued, the gold\r\nescudo, worth 16 reales de plata, was declared to be worth 37-1/2 reales\r\nde vellón.\r\n\r\nWith the Revolution the old coinage passed away and was replaced by the\r\ndecimal system, the _peseta_ and _céntimo_ being equivalent to the\r\nFrench franc and centime. Yet still prices continue to be quoted in\r\nreales, which are now rated at 25 céntimos, or about 5 cents of American\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nNothing is more difficult than to ascertain accurately the variation in\r\nthe purchasing power of money, but perhaps the price of labor affords\r\nthe most trustworthy standard. In the fifteenth century this would seem\r\nto have been about 6 maravedís a day. In the eighteenth, common laborers\r\nemployed in the mints received 3-1/2 reales de vellón per diem, while\r\nthose in more confidential positions such as watchmen were paid 6.[1338]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course the kingdoms of the Crown of Aragon had their\r\nindependent systems of coinage, which were based on the old divisions of\r\nthe marc, almost everywhere prevalent, of _libras_, _sueldos_ and\r\n_dineros_, or pounds, shillings and pence, there being 20 sueldos to the\r\nlibra and 12 dineros to the sueldo. In the documents of the early period\r\nthere are frequent fluctuations in the relations between these coins and\r\nthe Castilian system, but as a rule there were reckoned 20 Aragonese\r\nsueldos to the ducat, which therefore was equivalent to the libra. In\r\nCatalonia the _sueldo barcelonense_ was 24 to the ducat, and there was\r\nalso a coin known as _morabatin_, equal to 9 sueldos. Unification of\r\ncurrency throughout the monarchy was a desirable object, long frustrated\r\nby the stubborn particularism of the provinces. It was especially\r\ndifficult to bring about in Catalonia, where the vellón coinage had been\r\nlargely diluted by the allies during their long occupation of the\r\nprincipality in the War of Succession. An edict of 1733 informs us that\r\nthere were 24 dineros to the Catalan real, but most of those in\r\ncirculation of the coinage of 1653 had been restamped by the allies to\r\ndouble their nominal value. They had also coined _dinerillos Catalanes_\r\nwith the same alloy of silver as the mintage of 1653, but with only half\r\nthe weight, yet circulated at the full value. The edict denounces the\r\n_dinerillos_ of both Aragon and Catalonia as an intolerable abuse and\r\nwith superfluous emphasis orders their use to be abandoned, immediately\r\nin Aragon and in Catalonia as soon as sufficient money of vellón can be\r\ncoined to take their place. The effort was futile for another edict of\r\n1737 assimilates the dinerillo of Aragon and Valencia to the Castilian\r\n_ochavo_, or piece of 2 maravedís, and the dinerillo of Catalonia to 1\r\nmaravedí. In 1743, in consequence of disputes arising between troops\r\nquartered in Catalonia and the peasants, it was ordered that the vellón\r\nmoney of Castile should circulate freely in Aragon, Catalonia and\r\nMajorca. As late as 1772 an edict calls in the local small coinage of\r\nValencia and orders it replaced with Castilian money, but this was so\r\nunsuccessful that it was followed, in 1777, with one confining the use\r\nof these coins to Valencia and forbidding their circulation elsewhere.\r\nWhen the unification of the currency occurred does not clearly appear,\r\nbut it probably was not until the revision of the monetary system in the\r\npresent century.\r\n\r\nThe old _cruzado_ of Portugal, to which reference sometimes occurs, was\r\nvirtually the same as the Spanish ducat.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nLETTER OF KING FERDINAND TO THE INQUISITOR-GENERAL TORQUEMADA, July 22,\r\n1486.\r\n\r\n(See pp. 132, 254, 291).\r\n\r\n(Archivo General de la Corona de Aragon, Registro 3684, fol. 102).\r\n\r\nEL REY.\r\n\r\nDevoto padre Prior.

Quanto a la\r\nparticion de los bienes dentre marido e muger quando el uno es\r\nsentenciado y el otro se falla inmune porque es cosa que esta en drecho\r\ny en fuero del reino me parece que lo debeis mandar veer a micer Ponce y\r\notros letrados y que sea menester y mas convenga. Quanto al cinqueno\r\ncapitulo que fabla de las carceles perpetuas es muy gran razon que se\r\nfaga e yo enbio a mandar al receptor que las faga. Quanto al sexto\r\ncapitulo en que dicen que se embie a mandar que se ha de dar a los\r\nencarcerados para su mantenemiento me parece escriban aca su parecer y\r\nentonce sobrello podremos determinar lo que paresca mas razonable.\r\nQuanto al seteno que dicen que han tomado un hombre para tormentar\r\nporque dicen que los nuncios no lo quieren facer ni fallan quien lo\r\nfaga, me parece que por scusar tantos salarios devrian echar uno de los\r\nnuncios e que la persona que han tomado para tormentar sirviere de\r\nnuncio e se le diese el mismo salario e puesto que esto no se puede\r\nfacer se debe limitar el salario, porque seiscientos sueldos es muy\r\nsobrado salario. Quanto al ocheno capitulo en que fabla del salario de\r\nDon Ramon de Mur es justa cosa que pues que bien sirve sea muy bien\r\npagado, e se le den dos mil sueldos de salario. Quanto al noveno\r\ncapitulo que fabla de los porteros estoy maravillado que pagando tan\r\ngran salario como se pagó al aguacil allende aquello se hayan de pagar\r\nporteros que acá como sabeis todo esta a cargo del aguacil. Debeis les\r\nmucho encargar a los inquisidores que lo miren porque se asi no lo fazen\r\nmas montarán los salarios que proceda de la inquisicion. Quanto al\r\ndeceno capitulo que dice que han de facer e fazen un lugarteniente de\r\naguacil para enviar de fuera, parece que se les debe escribir que en las\r\ncosas que buenamente escusar se pudieren lo deben escusar, faciendo ir a\r\nello al alguacil principal, pero no pudiendo ir el fagase un\r\nlugarteniente como lo acostumbran de facer, pero sea el salario lo menos\r\nque ser pueda porque bien mirado son muy excesivos los salarios que se\r\npagan a la inquisicion. En lo que dicen que tengo fecha merced de los\r\nbienes de Pedro de Urrea saben poco en la verdad porque es cierto que de\r\naquellos ni de otros tengo fecha merced a nadie. Quanto al onceno\r\ncapitulo en que demandan carta de marca e represalia para Tudela por el\r\nnegocio de Martin de Santangel ha de preceder carta requisitoria la qual\r\ndebeis mandar ordenar allá a micer Ponte y enviandola aca luego se\r\ndespachará. En el dozeno esta ya respondido y quanto a lo que escriben\r\nen el treceno que no han egecutado los matadores de maestre Epila\r\npluguierame mucho que vos escribieran las causas porque. Quanto al\r\ncatorceno capitulo en que escriben que seria bueno que fuere maestro\r\nCrespo a entender en la inquisicion con el abad de Barbastro, buen\r\nhombre es sin duda e pareceme bien que vaya e asimismo me parece bien\r\nmicer Tristan de la Porta para que vaya a fazer assesor como lo escriben\r\nen el quatorceno capitulo que buen letrado es e hombre de buena fama. En\r\nel dezeseyseno e ultimo demandan un escribano para los bienes que se han\r\nde litigar por justicia y lo han de determinar ellos como jueces.\r\nVerdaderamente demandan tantos oficiales y acrecentamiento de tantos\r\nsalarios que es menester que se mire mucho en ello, mayormente que es\r\ncierto segun Camanyas me ha dicho que los escribanos de la inquisicion\r\nsienten a injuria que otro entiende en el dicho negocio sino ellos,\r\nmayormente que podrian poner en ello criado suyo de quien se confien. Si\r\nen todo lo sobredicho o en algo dello vos parece otra cosa vedlo alla y\r\nescrivitme vuestro parecer porque sobre todo se mire e se faga lo\r\nmejor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _DOCUMENTS_]\r\n\r\nCamanyas me dijo como vos habia fablado sobre los Judios de Teruel que\r\nles han mandado ir dentro de termino de tres meses e que dize se fizo\r\ncon voluntad mia. Essa es la verdad que assi me plugo e me plaze dello e\r\nnunca será de otro parecer; verdad es que en lo del tiempo tienen razon\r\nporque creo que en tampoco tiempo no podrian pagar y cobrar deudas\r\nmaiormente teniendo como tienen censales, ni podrian vender las casas y\r\nheredamientos que tienen e por esso sera bien si asi a vos paresciere\r\nque se les den otros seis meses de tiempo sobre los tres que los\r\ninquisidores han dado porque de aquellos segun dicen ha pasado ya buena\r\nparte. Vedlo vos e si os paresciere bien asi fagase. E por agora no\r\nocurre otro que escrivir salvo que vos ruego mucho que de la salut de\r\nvuestra persona continuamente me fagais sabidor. Del Viso á XXII de\r\njulio de LXXXVI años. Yo el Rey. Por mandado del Rey.

Dada en la Ciudad de Cordova a treinte dias del mes de\r\nMayo, año del nascimiento de nuestro Salvador Jesu Christo de mill e\r\nquatrocientos e noventa e dos años.--Yo el Rey.--Yo la Reina.--Yo\r\nFerrand Alvarez de Toledo, Secretario del Rey e de la Reyna nuestros\r\nseñores la fize escrivir por su mandado.--En la forma acordada,\r\nRodericus Dottor.--Registrada, Perez Francisco de Madrid, Chanciller.\r\n\r\n(Hallase original en el Archivo de la Ciudad de Toledo).\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTORQUEMADA'S INSTRUCTIONS TO INQUISITORS, Dec., 1484.[1339]\r\n\r\n(Archivo General de Simancas, Consejo de la Inquisicion, Libro 933).\r\n\r\n(See p. 182).\r\n\r\n_Otras Capitulaciones por el Reverendo Señor Padre Prior de Santa Cruz\r\nhechas por sus Altezas é confirmadas._\r\n\r\nPor mandado de los serenisimos rey é reyna nuestros señores yo el prior\r\nde santa cruz, confesor de sus altezas, inquisidor general por la\r\nabtoridad apostolica en los reynos de Castilla é de Aragon, hordené los\r\narticulos siguientes cerca de algunas cosas tocantes á la sancta\r\ninquisicion é á sus ministros é oficiales los quales dichos capitulos\r\nmandan sus altezas que se guarden é cumplan é yo de parte de sus altezas\r\né por la abtoridad susodicha asi lo mando é son las que se siguen.\r\n\r\n1. Primeramente que en cada partido donde fuere necesario poner\r\ninquisicion é en los que agora la hay é se facen, aya dos inquisidores\r\ncon un buen asesor los quales sean personas letrados de buena fama é\r\nconciencia los mas idoneos que se puedan haber é que se les dé alguacil\r\né fiscal é notarios y los otros oficiales que son necesarios para la\r\ninquisicion los quales sean asi mesmo personas aviles é diligentes en su\r\ncalidad é que á los dichos inquisidores é oficiales les den é sean\r\nsituados sus salarios que deben haber, y es la merced de sus altezas é\r\nmandan que ninguno de los dichos oficiales lleve de su oficio derechos\r\nalgunos por los abtos que hiciere en la dicha inquisicion ó en los\r\nnegocios é cosas della dependientes so pena de perder el oficio, é\r\nmandan que ninguno de los inquisidores tengan oficial ninguno del dicho\r\noficio por su familiar porque al bien del negocio é al servicio de sus\r\naltezas asi cumple.\r\n\r\n2. Item plaze á sus altezas que en corte de Roma se ponga una buena\r\npersona que sea letrado é de buen celo para que procure los negocios\r\ntocantes á toda la inquisicion destos reinos é que sea pagado\r\ncompetentemente de los bienes confiscados por el delicto de la heregia é\r\napostasia que pertinescen á sus altezas é que asi lo mandan á sus\r\ntesoreros.\r\n\r\n3. Item por quanto en tiempo de Sixto papa quarto de buena memoria\r\nhemanaran de la corte Romana algunos rescriptos é bulas é confesionarios\r\nexorvitantes é contra derecho mucho en perjuicio de la inquisicion é\r\nministros della, mandan sus altezas que se libren cartas é provisiones\r\nque juntas sean generates para todo el reino con las quales se impida é\r\npueda impedir justamente la ejecucion de los tales rescriptos é bulas,\r\nsi alguno los impetrare é quisiere usar dellos fasta que con el papa sea\r\nconsultado é informado de la verdad por parte de sus altezas, por quanto\r\nno es de presumir que la intencion del santo padre sea dar impedimento\r\nen los negocios de la santa fe catolica, pero que las dichas provisiones\r\nde sus altezas no se publiquen fasta ver si el papa Inoscencio octavo\r\nmoderno algunas bulas ó requisitos concede ó de lugar que se expidan en\r\nsu corte en perjuicio de la sancta inquisicion.\r\n\r\n4. Item es la merced de sus altezas porque los inquisidores é sus\r\noficiales clerigos que trabajan en la dicha inquisicion sean\r\naprovechados é honrados de mandar á sus embajadores que procuren en su\r\nnombre un indulto del papa para que sus altezas puedan nombrar á las\r\ndichas personas de la dicha inquisicion en ciertas iglesias de sus\r\nreinos en las primeras dignidades é beneficios que vacaren é que\r\naquellos sean reservados para los nombrados de sus altezas.\r\n\r\n5. Otrosi mandan sus altezas que por quanto tienen por bien de hacer\r\nmerced de sus bienes á todos aquellos que como quier que fuesen culpados\r\nen el delicto de la heretica pravedat se reconciliaren bien é como deben\r\nen el tiempo de la gracia que los tales reconciliados puedan cobrar\r\nqualesquier debdas de qualesquier tiempo que les fuesen debidas para si\r\né que su fisco no les embargue asi mesmo si algunos bienes muebles é\r\nraices hayan vendido, dado ó otorgado ó obligado antes de su\r\nreconciliacion que los dichos contractos queden firmos á las personas\r\nque administren los dichos bienes porque es la merced de sus altezas é\r\nmandan que los dichos reconciliados no puedan vender ni enagenar ni\r\nobligar dende en adelante los bienes raices que tovieren sin especial\r\nlicentia de sus altezas porque quieren ser primero informados de como\r\nguardan la santa fe catolica é si son verdaderamente convertido á ella.\r\n\r\n6. Item como quiera que sus altezas no tienen por bien de hacer gracia\r\nde los bienes á los hereges é apostatas que fueron reconciliados fuera\r\ndel tiempo de la gracia para la reconciliacion y les pertinezcan todos\r\nlos bienes de los hereges condempnados e reconciliados desde el dia que\r\ncometieron el dicho delicto de la heregia segun el derecho dispone y\r\npodria el fisco de sus altezas demandar los bienes que los tales ovieren\r\nvendido ó enagenado en qualquier manera é escusarse de pagar las debdas\r\nque los tales debiesen por qualquier obligaciones, salvo si en lugar de\r\nlas tales ventas é enagenaciones paresciere y se hallare el prescio é\r\notra cosa equivalente en los bienes de los tales hereges, pero por mas\r\nde clemencia é umagnidad con sus vasallos y porque si algunos con buena\r\nfe contrataron con los dichos hereges que no sean condempnados que sean\r\nreconciliados como dicho es hicieron antes que començase el año de\r\nsetenta é nueve, valgan é sean firmes, con tanto que se prueben\r\nlegitimamente por testigos dignos de fe ó por scripturas abtenticas que\r\nsean verdaderas é no simuladas en tal manera que si alguna persona\r\nhiciere alguna ynfinta ó simulacion en fraude del fisco cerca de\r\nqualquier contrato ó fuere participante en la dicha fraude ó colusion y\r\nfuere reconciliado le den cient azotes y le hierren con una señal de\r\nhierro en el rostro, y si fuere qualquier otro que no sea reconciliado\r\naunque sea cristiano haya perdido todos sus bienes é el oficio é oficios\r\nque toviere é que su persona quede á su merced de sus altezas, é mandan\r\nque este capitulo sea pregonado publicamente en los lugares de la\r\ninquisicion porque ninguno pueda pretender ignorancia.\r\n\r\n7. Otrosi que si algun caballero de los que han acogido ó acogieren en\r\nsus tierras los hereges que por temor de la inquisicion huyan y huyeron\r\nde las cibdades, villas é lugares realengos demandaren qualesquier\r\ndebdas que digan serles debidas por qualesquier hereges que sean huydos\r\ná sus tierras que no el tesorero no les pague las debdas ya dichas ni el\r\njuez de los bienes confiscados se las mande pagar fasta que los dichos\r\ncaballeros restituyan todo lo que los dichos confesos que cogieron en\r\nsus tierras llevaron consigo, pues es cierto que aquella pertenescia é\r\npertenesce á sus altezas é que si sobre tales debdas fuere puesta\r\ndemanda al procurador fiscal que el dicho procurador ponga por\r\nreconvencion é compensacion la cantidad en que poco mas ó menos le\r\nparescere que es obligado el caballero que pide su debda jurando que no\r\nlo alega maliciosamente.\r\n\r\n8. Otrosi mandan sus altezas que ningun tesorero de los que son ó fueren\r\npuestos para recebir é recabdar los bienes confiscados por el dicho\r\ndelicto no secresten ni occupen bienes de ningund herege ni apostata sin\r\nmandamiento especial de los dichos inquisidores é quando ellos dieren\r\nmandamiento para ello hagase la secrestacion por su alguacil é por ante\r\nnotario de la inquisicion é por antel escribano del tesorero para que\r\ncada uno dellos haga registro del dicho secresto el qual mandan que se\r\nhaga en personas llanas vecinos del lugar que tengan los dichos bienes é\r\nquel tesorero no toque en ellos fasta que la persona cuyos eran los\r\ndichos bienes sea condenada ó por reconciliacion declarada que fue\r\nherege é manda é mandan sus altezas que al tiempo de la secrestacion se\r\noviere de hacer el tesorero sea requerido por el alguacil para que vaya\r\ná ver como se face.\r\n\r\n9. Que si en los bienes asi secrestados como dicho es oviere é se\r\nfallaren algunas cosas que guardandolas se perderian asi como pan é vino\r\né otras cosas semejantes que el tesorero procure con los inquisidores\r\nque las manden vender é al presente se vendan en publica almoneda é que\r\nel prescio de las tales cosas sea puesto en el dicho secresto en poder\r\nde los dichos secrestadores ó en un cambio como mejor los dichos\r\ninquisidores y el tesorero vieren, asi mismo si algunos bienes raices\r\novieren que se deban arrendar manden los dichos inquisidores al\r\nsecrestador que juntamente con el dicho tesorero los arriende en publica\r\nalmoneda.\r\n\r\n10. Otrosi que el tesorero no venda bienes algunos ni reciba dineros ni\r\nqualesquier bienes algunos otros que sean confiscados é pertenescian al\r\nfisco de sus altezas sin que esten delante de dos notarios uno suyo del\r\ndicho tesorero é otro que sea puesto por magno de sus altezas para que\r\ncada uno dellos escriba sobre si los bienes é maravedises que el dicho\r\ntesorero rescibiere é haga registro é libro ordenado de todo ello para\r\nque [de] los dichos libros é registros se tomen despues las cuentas al\r\ndicho recebdor.\r\n\r\n11. Otrosi mandan sus altezas que cada uno de los recebtores que fueren\r\npuestos por su mandado recabten é resciban los bienes que fueren de los\r\nherejes vecinos é moradores en el partido donde son puestos é no se\r\nentremetan á ocupar ni tomar bienes de ningun hereje que pertenezcan á\r\notra inquisicion mas que luego qualquier de los dichos tesoreros hobiere\r\nnoticia de algunos bienes confiscados por el dicho delicto que\r\npertenezcan á otro tesorero que lo hagan luego saber para que lo cobre\r\né recabte so pena que el que lo encubriera pierde el oficio ó sea\r\nobligado al daño é menoscabo que por su negligencia se recresciere al\r\npatrimonio de sus altezas con el doblo.\r\n\r\n12. Otrosi mandan sus altezas que a los inquisidores é oficiales que en\r\neste negocio de la inquisicion entienden el tesorero les pague los\r\ntercios de sus salarios adelantados en el principio de cada tercio\r\nporque tengan que comer é se les quite ocasion de recebir dadivas é que\r\nes comience el tiempo de su paga desde el dia que salieren de sus casas\r\ná entender en la dicha inquisicion, é que asi mesmo pague los mensageros\r\nque á sus altezas enviaren los dichos inquisidores é qualquier otras\r\ncosas que los inquisidores vieren que cumple al oficio asi como en\r\ncarceles perpetuas ó mantenimientos de los presos ó otras qualesquier\r\ncosas é espensas.\r\n\r\n13. Item que todos los mandamientos de qualquier calidad que sean que\r\nlos inquisidores mandaren dar asi para su alguacil como para su tesorero\r\nó para qualesquier otras personas cerca de los bienes ó prision de las\r\npersonas de los herejes, los negocios de la inquisicion, sean tenidos de\r\nlos asentar é asienten en sus registros é hagan libros dellos aparte,\r\nporque si alguna dubda se ofresciere se pueda saber la verdad de lo que\r\npaso.\r\n\r\n14. Otrosi que las otras cosas que aqui no son declarados queden é se\r\nremitan á la buena discreccion de los inquisidores para que si se\r\nofrescieren casos tales que á su parescer se puedan espedir sin\r\nconsultar á sus altezas hagan segun Dios é derecho é sus buenas\r\nconciencias lo que les paresciere é en las cosas graves escriban luego\r\ncon diligencia á sus altezas é á mi el dicho procurador para que sus\r\naltezas manden proveer en ello como cumpla al servicio de Dios nuestro\r\nseñor é suyo, ensalzamiento de nuestra sancta fe catolica é á buena\r\nedificacion de la cristiandad. Dada en la ciudad de Sevilla, seis dias\r\ndel mes de Deziembre, año del nascimiento de nuestro Salvador\r\nJesucristo, de mil é quatrocientos é ochenta é quatro años.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTORQUEMADA'S INSTRUCTIONS TO INQUISITORS, Jan., 1485.[1340]\r\n\r\n(Archivo General de Simancas, Consejo de la Inquisicion, Libro 933).\r\n\r\n(See p. 182).\r\n\r\n_La Forma que se debe tener en el proceder de los Inquisidores es la\r\nsiguiente._\r\n\r\nPrimeramente que los inquisidores loego en legando en el lugar donde se\r\nha de facer la inquisicion pongan sus cartas e edictos de treinta ó\r\nquarenta dias ó como mejor visto les fuese que todos los que en algun\r\ncaso de heregia ó apostasia se fallaran culpados y en este dicho tiempo\r\nvernan con dolor sin fuerza ninguna á confesar sus errores y diran la\r\nverdad de todo lo que supiere no solamente de si mesmos mas de los otros\r\nque con ellos participaren en el dicho error, que estos tales sean\r\nrecebidos con toda caridad, y abjurando sus errores en forma les sean\r\ndadas penitencias publicas ó secretas segun la infamia ó calidad del\r\ndelito á alvedrio de los inquisidores y denseles algunas penitencias\r\npecuniarias que paguen en cierto tiempo, y estos dineros sean puestos en\r\nmano de una persona fiable y den los inquisidores ó los escribanos la\r\ncopia dellos al rey nuestro señor ó á mi como á inquisidor principal,\r\npara que se gasten en la guerra ó en otras obras pias y para que se\r\npaguen los salarios de los inquisidores y otros ministros que en la\r\nsanta inquisicion entenderan, y seanles dexados todas los otros bienes\r\nque tuvieren asi mobles como raices, y cerca de los oficios publicos que\r\ntienen deben por ahora ser privados fasta que se vea su forma de vevir,\r\ny si fueren buenos cristianos y conocidamente se viere la enmienda en\r\nellos pueden ser habilitados para que ayan los dichos oficios si fueren\r\nvacos ó otros semejables.\r\n\r\n1. Otrosí si despues del tiempo del edicto algunos vinieren á se\r\nreconciliar, los quales non dejaron de venir por temor ni por\r\nmenosprecio mas por enfermedad ó por otro justo impedimento, que con\r\nestos tales se use de misericordia como en el capitulo primero, pero si\r\nal tiempo que se vinieren á reconciliar fueron ya citados ó tienen\r\ncontra si provantes, estos non gocen de la gracia de los bienes, pero\r\nlos inquisidores se hayan con ellos misericordiosamente quanto de\r\nderecho y buena conciencia podieren facer segun la calidad del delito é\r\ninfamia requiere é segund esto consultando con el rey nuestro señor se\r\nverá si se debierá fazer gracia de los bienes ó no.\r\n\r\n2. Otrosí si á estos que asi bien se vinieren á reconciliar son debidas\r\nalgunas deudas, que los deudores sean obligados sin embargo del fisco á\r\nge les pagar, y si algunas ventas de sus bienes ovieren fechas que\r\nvalgan y que por parte del fisco del rey nuestro señor no les sean\r\nimpedidos, pero si estos tales tovieren esclavos cristianos que sean\r\nlibres y forros, y si los hobieren vendido los que les compraren non los\r\npuedan retener mas que luego los dejen forros y ellos recauden el precio\r\nde los vendidores.\r\n\r\n3. Otrosí si algunos de los susodichos que se vinieren á reconciliar y\r\nno dizieren la verdad de sus errores é de los que fueron particioneros\r\ncon ellos é despues se fallaren por las probanzas el contrario, estos\r\ntales sean havidos por contumaces é que vinieron fingidos á la\r\nconfesion, no gocen de nada de lo susodicho mas antes se proceda contra\r\nellos con todo rigor segun que el derecho en tal caso dispone.\r\n\r\n4. Otrosí que ningun receptor debe sequestrar bienes de ningun herege\r\nnin apostata sin especial mandamiento en escrito de los inquisidores é\r\nque se pongan los tales bienes no en manos del receptor mas en manos de\r\nuna persona fiable y que hagan el secuestro el receptor con el alguacil\r\nde la inquisicion y por delante de dos escribanos, uno del alguazil y\r\notro del receptor, y estos escribanos cada una escriba por si todo lo\r\nque se sequestrare, y sean pagados los dichos escribanos de los bienes\r\nde los dichos hereges aunque despues se hayan de reconciliar, y el\r\nsalario sea lo que los inquisidores mandaren.\r\n\r\n5. Otrosí si algunos fueren absentados antes del tiempo del edicto y asi\r\nmesmo absentaren sus bienes y estos tales vinieren en el tiempo del\r\ndicho edicto confesando sus errores como arriba dicho es, gocen de la\r\nmisma gracia de los bienes é fagase con ellos en la misma forma que en\r\nel capitulo primero está escrito, pero si en el tiempo del edicto non\r\nquisieren venir procedase contra ellos segun que en este caso el derecho\r\ndispone.\r\n\r\n6. Otrosí que ni por los procesos de los vivos se deben de dejar de\r\nfacer los de los muertos é los que se fallaren aver seydo é muerto como\r\nherejes ó judios los deben desenterrar para que se quemen y dar lugar al\r\nfisco para que occupe los bienes segun que de derecho se debe facer.\r\n\r\n7.

Primeramente que los inquisidores de cada una inquisicion é partido\r\nsalgan é vayan á todos los lugares é villas de sus diocesis é partidos\r\ndonde nunca fueron personalmente é en cada una de las dichas villas é\r\nlugares hagan é resciban los testigos de la general inquisicion, é para\r\nque esto puedan mejor hacer é mas brevemente se espida, se aparten los\r\ninquisidores é vaya cada uno por su parte con un notario del secreto\r\npara rescebir la dicha pesquisa é informacion general, é despues de\r\nrescibida é hecha la dicha pesquisa general se tornen á juntar en la\r\ncibdad ó lugar donde tovieren su asiento para que alli vista por amos la\r\ntestificacion que cada uno ha tomado puedan mandar prender á los que se\r\nhallaren culpados é testificados suficientemente para se poder prender\r\nsegun se contiene en el capitulo de las instrucciones hechas en Toledo.\r\n\r\n2. Item, que en las inquisiciones donde los inquisidores han andado é\r\nrecebido la general testificacion que cada año el uno de los\r\ninquisidores salga por las villas y lugares á inquerir, poniendo sus\r\nedictos generales para los que algo saben tocante al crimen de la\r\nheregia que lo venga á decir, y el otro inquisidor quede á hacer los\r\nprocesos que á la sazon oviere, é si no abra algunos salga cada uno por\r\nsu parte segun arriba esta dicho.\r\n\r\n3. Item, que los inquisidores de cada inquisicion pasen los libros\r\nordinariamente por sus abecedarios dende el primero fasta el fin, para\r\nlo qual se ayuden del fiscal é notarios quando non andovieren por los\r\nlugares á tomar la testificacion como dicho es.\r\n\r\nSobre esto capitulo se ha de hacer principal relacion en la visitacion\r\nde manera que han de saber los inquisidores generales que es lo que han\r\nprocedido de los dichos abecedarios.\r\n\r\n4. Item, por quanto los inquisidores algunas veces proceden por cosas\r\nlivianas non continentes herexia derechamente y por la palabras que mas\r\nson blasfemias que herejias, ó dichas con enojo ó yra, que de aqui\r\nadelante no se prenden ningunos desta calidad, é si dubda oviere que lo\r\nconsulten con los inquisidores generales.\r\n\r\n5. Item, quando prendieren alguno por el dicho crimen de herejia en\r\nponiendole la acusacion envien la copia della á los inquisidores\r\ngenerales y la probanza que tienen contra el verba ad verbum declarando\r\nlos nombres de los testigos y las calidades de las personas y esto\r\nenvien con el nuncio de la inquisicion á buen recabdo.\r\n\r\n6. Item, que los inquisidores non consientan dilacion en los procesos é\r\nprocedan sumariamente segun la forma del derecho que en este caso de la\r\nherejia habla.\r\n\r\n7. Item, que los inquisidores de aqui adelante non dispensen con los que\r\nfueren condempnados a carcel perpetua ni les comuten la dicha carcel en\r\notra penitencia é quando esta facultad de dispensar é comutar la dicha\r\ncarcel los dichos inquisidores generales les reservan para si la dicha\r\nfacultad é poder que ninguno otro pueda dispensar é comutar.\r\n\r\n8. Item, que á los testigos conpurgadores no les sean leidos los dichos\r\né dipusciones de los testigos del crimen que hay contra el acusado en la\r\nacusacion del fiscal, sino que guarde la forma del derecho que es que el\r\nacusado ha de jurar juxta formam juris que el [niega] el crimen de lo\r\nque esta asentado, ante los dichos testigos compurgadores, é que á ellos\r\nse les pregunte si creen que juro verdad ó no, sin hacerles otras\r\npreguntas.\r\n\r\n9. Item, los inquisidores trabajen con los procesados que estaran bien\r\ntestificados para poder ser condempnados como hagan conoscimiento de su\r\nculpa y la confiesen y tengan arrepentimiento, trayendoles persuasiones\r\npara ello é si fuere menester que trayan personas religiosas que los\r\nconviertan é con los que asi no estovieren testiguados tengan tiento que\r\nno les fagan confesar lo que no hicieren.\r\n\r\n10. Item, que los inquisidores pregunten particularmente á los personas\r\nque dieren sus confesiones lo que saben de sus padres y hermanos y\r\nparientes é de otras personas qualesquiera por las particularidades que\r\nse requieren porque despues no se puedan escusar por ignorancia, é lo\r\nque asi digeren de otros se asiente en los libros é registros de oficio\r\naparte de las dichas confesiones.\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM THE REGISTER OF THE RECEIVER OF CONFISCATIONS AT VALENCIA,\r\n1485-1486.\r\n\r\n(Archivo General de la Corona de Aragon, Registro 3684, fol. 60).\r\n\r\n(See p. 192).\r\n\r\nA veynte y dos de julio el Rey nuestro senyor me mandó que asentase en\r\nel registro como su Alteza facia merced á su caballerizo Johan de Hoz e\r\ná Martin Navarro su repostero de plata de sendas escrivanias de aquellas\r\ntres que estan vacas en Toledo porque han sido privados dellas por el\r\ndelito de la heregia Pero Gia de Alcuba e Alfonso Cota e Francisco\r\nRodriguez escrivanos de numero reconciliados.\r\n\r\nA diez y ocho de agosto de ochenta y cinco años plugo al Rey nuestro\r\nseñor de librar á Johan de Tencino en los bienes de los herejes que á su\r\nAlteza pertenescan ó perteneceran de aqui en adelante en los reynos de\r\nAragon aquellos diez mil sueldos de que le hizo merced en ayuda de su\r\ncasamiento e aquellos seys mil seyscientos cincuenta y cinco sueldos\r\nocho dineros que le son devidos de su quitacion con alvalaes de\r\nescribano de racion.

Patronato Real, Inquisicion, Legajo único,\r\nfol. 49).\r\n\r\n(See p. 219).\r\n\r\nSy en las cosas de la inquisicion se pone orden de justicia por jueces\r\nno sospechosos que guarden el derecho e den cuenta de lo que hicieren,\r\npara que los buenos puedan bevir seguros y los que mal bivieren sean\r\ncastigados como nuestro muy santo padre lo ordenare e mandare e las\r\nbulas e breves que sobre ello dieren sean obedecidas e cumplidas como de\r\njusticia e conciencia no se puede otra cosa hazer, avra personas que\r\nosaran servir al Rey nuestro señor en esta manera.\r\n\r\nHabida consideracion que la codicia de los bienes es causa de todos los\r\nmalos, e que es ley en los reynos de Castilla en las partidas que no\r\nsean confiscados los bienes de los que tovieren hijos catolicos e que a\r\nlos principes queda muy poco provecho de la confiscacion porque todo se\r\ngasta en salarios, costa de jueces e recebtores que de ello enriquecen,\r\npuede su Mag^{d} justamente servirle por compusicion e venta que haga de\r\ntodo el derecho que le pertinece a el e a sus descendientes para syempre\r\njamas de la confiscation de los bienes de la dicha inquisicion en todos\r\nsus reynos e señorios abiendo para ello bula de nuestro muy santo padre\r\nen que asi mismo se mande y ordene que no pueda aber condenacion de\r\nbienes ni dineros por via de penitencia ni en otra manera. Por lo qual y\r\npor lo que se debe hasta agora de las confiscaciones e penas e\r\ncompusiciones pasadas por qualesquier personas en qualquier\r\nmanera--dando para ello las provisiones e jueces que fueron menester--se\r\ndara por esto a su Magestad quatrocientos mill ducados; los cien mill\r\nducados de ellos para el tiempo de su partida al ymperio, e los\r\ntrecientos mill en tres años puestos en Flandes en las ferias de Emberes\r\ndel mes de mayo de cada año cien mill ducados.\r\n\r\nY si paresciere algun inconveniente que esto se haga a perpetuo, aunque\r\nno le ay, abida consideracion a la dicha ley del reyno, y su Magestad\r\nfuere servido que sea por algun tiempo limitado, por el tiempo que fuere\r\ndeclarado por S. M. se daran doscientos mill ducados, los cinquenta mill\r\npara la partida e los ciento e cinquenta mill ducados en las dichas tres\r\nherias de enberes.\r\n\r\nE por que los jueces diputados para tan santo oficio estan mas libres\r\npara hacer justicia sin esperar de sostinerse de los bienes de los\r\npresos e su magestad no tenga que pagar salarios pues no ha de haber\r\nconfiscacion demas de lo que asi se ha de dar por la dicha confiscacion\r\nse comprara la renta que fuere menester a vista e determinacion e\r\nmoderacion de su magestad para pagar todos los salarios e cosas de la\r\ndicha inquisicion sobre lo que ya esta comprado e consynado para ello en\r\nalgunas partes, comprandolo de la manera e segund que el rey catolico lo\r\ntenya mandado e çomençado a comprar.\r\n\r\nE para la cobranza de lo susodicho se ha de dar otras tales cartas e\r\nprovisiones como las que dio el rey catolico para cobrar las\r\ncompusyciones del Andalucia e las que mas fuere menester, e para\r\nremediar qualquier agrabio que syntieren los que esto ovieren de pagar e\r\nproveer en ello e en la cobrança dello, lo que fuere necesario que se\r\ncometa al arzobispo de Toledo o a su gobernador para en los Reynos de la\r\ncorona de Castilla, y el arzobispo de Çaragoça para los reynos de la\r\ncorona de Aragon, para que ellos o las personas a quien le cometieren\r\nconozcan de ello e lo provean syn pleyto, e no otros jueces algunos,\r\nremota apelacion.\r\n\r\nE abiendo efeto lo susodicho sy S. M. fuere servido de dar poderes e\r\nprovisiones bastantes para cobrar e componer e ygualar todo lo que le es\r\ndebido y pertenece en qualquier manera en los dichos sus reynos e\r\nseñorios de qualquier otras confiscaciones e penas pertenecientes a la\r\ncamera e fisco por las leyes e prematicas de los dichos reynos o en otra\r\nmanera e qualesquier bienes que estan confiscados e adjudicados por\r\ndelitos de que no este hecha merced e las tengan qualesquier personas de\r\nqualesquier tiempos pasados hasta en fin de este año, y le perteneciere\r\nde aqui adelante en estos quatro años venideros que se cumplan en fin\r\ndel año de quinientos e veynte e tres, e que entre en esto lo que\r\nqualesquier personas de su voluntad vinieren, declarando que son en\r\ncargo, de que tengan finequito e no aya memoria ni recabdo por donde se\r\nle puede pedir quenta, e se puedan componer e cobrar lo que dieren, e\r\npor esto sanearan a S. M. cien mil ducados pagados en la dichas tres\r\nferias de enberes, e sy mas valiere lo susodicho sea para S. M. quitando\r\nlas costas e el salario que S. M. fuere serbido de dar por ello, e que\r\nsi alguna merced o libranza se hiciere de bienes ó maravedises en lo\r\nsusodicho durante este tiempo se reciba en cuenta.\r\n\r\nE porque para el cumplimiento de todo lo susodicho se ha de dar\r\nseguridad bastante de personas que se obliguen a ello, se han de dar\r\nluego cedulas de S. M. libradas del S^{r} Cardenal por donde de licencia\r\ne facultad a las personas que en ello quisieren entender e obligarse e\r\ncontribuir, que lo puedan hazer syn que por ello incurran ni se les pida\r\npena ni achaque alguno de parte de la ynquisicion ni por otras\r\njusticias, las quales cedulas se han de dar en todo este mes de otubre,\r\nsi los dineros han de estar prestos para la partida, porque de otra\r\nmanera faltaria tiempo.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL FROM GRANADA TO CHARLES V IN 1526.\r\n\r\n(Archivo de Simancas, Patronato Real, Inquisicion, Legajo único, fol.\r\n55).\r\n\r\n(See p. 222).\r\n\r\nVuestra Magestad manda é á mandado poner la Sancta Inquisicion en esta\r\nCiudad y Reyno de Granada, lo qual es muy loable y muy santo por que se\r\nvea de creer que la intencion y voluntad de Vuestra Magestad es que los\r\nmalos christianos sean castigados y los bonos sean conocidos, y por que\r\nen la manera de proceder en el Sancto Officio pasan mas peligros los que\r\nbuenos son que los que mal biben, asy de ser presos como condenados sin\r\nculpa segun que muchas veces a acaecido, todos los que bien biben y son\r\ncatolicos christianos suplican a Vuestra Magestad mande enmendar la\r\nmanera de proceder en que los testigos y carceles sean publicos como lo\r\nson en el pecado abominable y contra natura, que como en este son\r\nconocidos y castigados los malos asy lo seran en este otro, y los que\r\nson buenos y biben bien estaran seguros de ser acusados falsemente, y\r\npor que Vuestra Magestad use de tan justa peticion y misericordia con\r\nlos que buenos son, de solo este pequeño Reyno de granada, serviran a\r\nVuestra Magestad con cinquenta mill ducados para los gastos de este tan\r\nsancto viage sin lo que mas Vuestra Magestad podra aver de los otros sus\r\nReynos y Señorios que sera en grandisima suma de dinero, y quitando este\r\nmucho secreto escusera Vuestra Magestad los incombenientes de pecados\r\nsiguientes.\r\n\r\nLo primero que si los jueces son malos como puede acaecer por ser\r\nhombres humanos y no Santos como lo es el Officio, quando prenden\r\ndoncellas y casadas de buenos justos y moças, ó quando las mandan venir\r\nsecretamente ante si como el Officio requiere en su mano sepan usar de\r\nellos como cosa suya, lo qual ligeramente ya sentiran con el gran temor\r\nque lleban, y esto no habra lugar de se hacer en juicio publico.\r\n\r\nY la otra, que los escribanos de este secreto y los officiales que en\r\neste secreto tienen mano, seyendo mancebos, como en algunas partes lo\r\nson, tienen ó casi han de hacer lo misma con hijas ó mugeres ó parientas\r\nde presos, las quales ligeramente puedan alcanzar, y les sera concedido\r\npor saber algo de este secreto que les combenga, ó sí fuesen malas\r\npersonas como entre los hombres se hallan, tambien tienen ocasion de\r\nbender por dineros este secreto, por que los que asy son malos con fin\r\nde ser aprovechados procuran estos officios, lo qual todo se quita con\r\nhacer la justicia publica.\r\n\r\nEn lo otro tienen a causa de este secreto que muchas animas que se han\r\ncondenado al ynfierno e se pueden condenar por ser tan falsas,\r\nescusarseles a este camino, que por poder decir lo que dicen secreto muy\r\nligeramente se condenan y dicen lo que no vieron por aver venganza de\r\nquien tienen mala voluntad como cada dia a sucedido, sy quando Dios le\r\nhace merced al falsamente acusado que se da por bueno sale destruydo\r\ndemas de la infamia de su prision, lo qual se escusaria seyendo los\r\ntestigos publicos.\r\n\r\nE lo otro que para que el que falsamente se acusa no tenga remedio,\r\npuedense buscar los testigos por dineros, los quales por estos pecados\r\nse hallan oy con poco trabajo, y como el acusado no los conosca y lo que\r\nle acusan nunca hiso ni penso no puede caer en los acusadores, y aunque\r\ncayga en su enemigo contrario que lo hiso atestiguar, y como los jueces\r\nno sepan este secreto condenan justamente y el falsamente acusado muere\r\nsin culpa, y quedan sus hijos y debdos infamados para siempre jamas, lo\r\nqual no se podria hacer seyendo publicos los testigos.\r\n\r\nE lo otro que como los que son malas personas y malos cristianos tengan\r\ny tienen odio y mala voluntad á los que son buenos porque no siguen sus\r\nmalos costumbres y obras: diz que por sus delitos son presos y los\r\nconfiesan; los primeros que acusan son los que saben que biben bien, por\r\nvengarse de ellos, y á estos les da lugar el secreto, que si publico lo\r\nobieren de decir no tendrian osadia de decir la mentira á la clara, por\r\nque se les probaria luego el contrario, y por este tienen menos\r\nseguridad los buenos que los malos, que como no hicieron ni pensaron lo\r\nque les acusan ni conoscan por platica ni conversacion á los acusadores\r\nni por ventura saben sus nombres no pueden caer ni acertar en ellos, y\r\ndesta manera son condenados justamente y mueren sin culpa por que no\r\nquieren conocer lo que no hicieron, y quedan destruydos sus hijos y\r\ndebdos y disfamados, los quales seyendo los testigos publicos no se\r\npodria hacer.\r\n\r\nE lo otro que á cabsa de este secreto mas facilmente se pueden librar\r\nlos que han cometido el delicto de que son acusados, por que el que lo\r\nhizo bien sabe quando y como y ante quien, y luego pueden acertar en\r\nquien lo acusa, y tachándolo como se hace es dado por libre, y la\r\nsentencia es justa, y el culpado queda sin castigo. Lo qual es por el\r\ncontrario a quel que falsamente se le acusa, que como no lo hizo ni sabe\r\nni puede saber de donde le viene el daño, sino fuere por inspiracion\r\ndivina, de la qual gracia no son dignas todas, pe ... y de esta manera\r\npasan mucho mas riesgo y peligro ... que son buenos y catolicos\r\ncristianos que los que ... y biben mal, en lo qual de Vuestra Magestad\r\n... poner este tan justo remedio que se le ... tiene puesto de su mano\r\npara la gobernacion ... y señorios, por que los buenos puedan biber ...\r\nser malos sean conocidos y castigados.[1343]\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nBULL OF SIXTUS IV, APRIL 18 1482, TEMPORARILY REFORMING THE INQUISITION\r\nOF ARAGON.\r\n\r\n(See p. 234).\r\n\r\n(Archivio Vaticano, Sisto IV, Regesto 674, T.

V. impetrata indulta talem suscipiunt audaciam quod non timent\r\nin eorum erroribus persistere. Predicte autem relationi impendimus fidem\r\nnullam, quod talia visa sunt quod nullatenus concedenda erant per S. V.\r\nque hujusmodi sancte inquisitionis negotium dirigere debet. Et si per\r\ndictorum neophitorum importunas et astutas persuasiones ea concessa\r\nforsitan fuerint eis nunquam locum dare intendo. Caveat igitur S. V.\r\ncontra dicti negotii prosequtionem quicquid impedimenta concedere et si\r\nquid concessum fuerit revocare et de nobis ipsius negotii cura confidere\r\nnon dubitare. Sed postquam S. V. aperte novit quantum cedit imo preter\r\nastutisimas neophitorum circuitiones opus est in Dei servitium et\r\ncristiane fidei decus quod inquisitores heretice pravitatis secundum\r\nbeneplacitum et voluntatem meam in his regnis et terris meis\r\ninstituantur et regio meo favore freti onus inquisitionis exerceant et\r\nhoc quidem modo ea que agenda sint perfici possunt et aliter nihil bene\r\nageretur circa ea quod facile quidem intellegi potest ex hoc quam\r\nsuperioribus temporibus dum de ejusmodi negotiis ego aut predecessores\r\nmei non nos intromittimus heretica pravitas in tantum succurruit et\r\nejusmodi morbi contagio per cristianum gregem se extendit quod\r\nquamplurimi qui pro cristianis habebantur non modo non cristiane sed\r\nneque secundum legem aliquam vivere reperti sunt et multa que ab illis\r\nin Cristi neglectum et vilipendium fiebant aperta sunt et in dies\r\nefundentur in publicum que ita proh dolor eveniunt culpa atque nequitia\r\ninquisitorum preteritorum qui munibus et corruptelis ab inquisitionibus\r\ndesistebant aut eas minus bene prosequebantur. Dignetur iccirco eadem S.\r\nV. hic mihi concedere circa inquisitiones predictas videlicet quod\r\nsanctitas vestra quamprimum confirmet predictos fratrem Joannem\r\nCristoforum de Gualbes et fratrem Joannem Orts in dicto inquisitionis\r\nofficio confirmetque eadem S. V. comisionem ad meam instantiam nuper\r\nfactam per magistratus ordinis fratrum predicatorum fratri Gaspari\r\nJutglar conventus illerdensis super instituendis et destituendis\r\ninquisitoribus in dicta provincia secundum beneplacitum et voluntatem\r\nmeam. Aut si melius videbitur S. V. alicui alteri fratri similem\r\ncomisionem faciat ut semper inquisitores nobis acceptos in dicta\r\nprovincia habeamus, quoniam alios contra voluntatem nostram hujusmodi\r\nofficium exercere nunquam permitere intendimus. Ita cum hec omnia fieri\r\nexpedit pater sancte in obsequium Cristi et catholice fidei decus jubeat\r\nergo Sanctitas vestra apostolicas provisiones et literas super predicta\r\nilico expediri quod erit mihi vehementer gratum accipiamque singularis\r\nbeneficii loco ab eadem Sanctitate vestra cujus almam personam Jesus\r\noptimus maximus feliciter et cum sacre Eclesie columna tueatur.

Y que las mas propias regalias de la dignidad regia\r\nson de derecho humano positivo ó de derecho de las gentes, y la potestad\r\nsuprema que ejerce la inquisicion por delegacion de la Sede apostolica\r\nen las causas de fee y concernientes á ella con todo lo demas de que\r\nnecesita para su recto y libre ejercicio directa ó indirectamente\r\npertenece al derecho divino, y como tal se sobrepone á todo derecho\r\nhumano y de las gentes y no esta sugeto á fueros ni leyes humanas, y lo\r\nmenos que se puede decir es que los principes seculares tienen\r\nobligacion de darsela como queda dicho, y aunque estos tengan derecho\r\npara que la que se tomare ó diere no sea mas que la que es menester, el\r\njuicio y arbitrio de la necesidad y de la extencion ó limitacion de\r\naquella pertenece á aquel en quien reside la dicha potestad eclesiastica\r\nsuprema, porque funda la que tiene en el derecho divino y no es posible\r\nque sallia la pureça de la fe y la obediencia y rendimiento que los\r\nprincipes deben á la Iglesia y á su cabeça sientan diferentemente de lo\r\nque aqui se dice, porque es el comun y verdadero sentir de los autores\r\ncatolicos y lo que pide la subordinacion de los derechos humanos á los\r\ndivinos y de los temporales á los espirituales de lo cual se infiere que\r\nel entendimiento verdadero del axioma ó modo de hablar referido se ha\r\nde restringir al uso de las jurisdicciones temporales que estan en una\r\nmisma linea cuando no compiten lo divino con lo humano ni lo espiritual\r\ncon lo temporal, porque estas y otras regalias temporales como ellas son\r\ntan inherentes á la potestad regia que no se puede desnudar dellas ni\r\nenagenarles enteramente.\r\n\r\nSeñor, todos estos principios son los solidos y seguros y hay en esta\r\nmateria con que los señores reyes progenitores de V. M. se han\r\nconformado asi en el sentir como en el obrar y los autores regnicolas de\r\nla corona han sentido y escrito en la misma conformidad y todo lo que\r\nsale de estos terminos con las doctrinas nuevas que pretenden que V. M.\r\nes dueño absoluto de esta jurisdiccion con facultad plena de disponer en\r\nella para quitarla es incierto, mal seguro para la conciencia, en nada\r\nconveniente para el Estado y muy peligroso el uso de ello no solo de\r\ncaer en hierros gravisimos, que despues no tengan reparo sino de que\r\nDios nuestro señor, cuia gloria es la mas interesada en el libre y recto\r\nejercicio de la inquisicion, agraviado de lo que en esto se innovare,\r\nexecute como suele castigos graves en los que pretenden estas mudanças\r\nque se apetecen con titulo de libertad á que aspiran siempre los reinos\r\ny son medio para perderlos, y quiera Dios que no sea una de las causas\r\nporque padece la Corona de Aragon tantos trabajos con la hostilidad de\r\nlos que injustamente la pretenden usurpar, el no acabar de quietarse en\r\nlas materias tocantes á la inquisicion, pretendiendo siempre introducir\r\nnovedades en ella, conque no solo se desagrada á Dios nuestro Señor sino\r\nse ofende al Estado con las alteraciones que ocasionan los sospechosos\r\nen la fee que suele ser gente sediciosa de que el reino de Aragon tiene\r\nejemplos presentes cuyos daños no se pudieran atajar sino es por medio\r\nde la Inquisicion....\r\n\r\n(Siguen otras razones que aclaran lo que la inquisicion pretende\r\ndemostrar, las cuales razones en sustancia son)\r\n\r\n3ª Que la jurisdiccion de la inquisicion es espiritual y no pueden\r\nmodificarla el rey y las cortes sin el consentimiento del Inquisidor\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\n4ª Que por su condicion de espiritual la inquisicion esta sobre los\r\nfueros; los derechos con que la inquisicion usa de la dicha jurisdiccion\r\nson superiores á las fueros e independientes de ellos....\r\n\r\n6ª Que si los brazos se obstinaban en no admitir las razones alegadas\r\npor la Inquisicion S. M. debia como el emperador Carlos V hizo en otras\r\ncortes el año 1516 (_sic_) acordarse de su alma y conciencia y preferir\r\nla perdida de parte de sus reinos á consentir en nada contra la honra de\r\nDios y en diminucion y desautoridad del Santo Oficio que tanto los\r\ncatolicos rey y reyna sus abuelos en sus testamentos y postrimeras\r\nvoluntades lo dexaron caramente encomendado....\r\n\r\nEl obispo de Plasencia, inquisidor general y este Consejo suplicamos a\r\nV. M. se sirva mandar se haga assi como lo pedimos en las dichas\r\nconsultas con ponderacion de tantas y tan solidas raçones como en ellas\r\nse proponen, excluyendo las pretensiones de los quatro braços y\r\nmanteniendo á la Inquisicion en el derecho que tiene y en la posesion en\r\nque está de que toda su jurisdiccion sea tratada en aquel reino de\r\nAragon como celesiastica y secular y la mas alta de todas como derivada\r\ndel derecho divino en que la Iglesia funda la suya, para conocer de las\r\ncausas de la fe, y para que no le falten los ministros necesarios con la\r\nindependencia que ha menester para el recto y libre ejercicio de la\r\ndicha jurisdiccion, y aunque presumimos que los dichos brazos, vistas\r\nlas dichas razones, mostraran su fidelidad á Dios y a V. M. para\r\ncontentarse del acuerda que se tomare, si todavia persistieren en sus\r\npretensiones negando los servicios que se les piden V. M. debe preferir\r\nel de Dios en que consiste el reinar y ordenara en todo lo que fuere del\r\nsuyo. Madrid á 5 de Mayo de 1646.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nDECREE OF PHILIP IV CONCERNING DISOBEDIENCE, MARCH 26, 1633.\r\n\r\n(Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Libro 32, fol. 56).\r\n\r\n(See p. 347).\r\n\r\nUno de los mayores daños y de que han resultado mayores inconvenientes,\r\nen grave deservicio mio y de la quietud y conservacion de todos mis\r\nreinos, es el de la inobservancia y dilacion en la ejecucion de mis\r\nórdenes, pues importa poca resolverlas si no se envian y ejecutan a\r\ntiempo, pues pasada la sazon viene a ser infructuoso todo lo que se\r\ndispone, de que se han seguido daños tan irreparables que quizá son la\r\nparte principal del apretado estado en que nos hallamos; diversos\r\nrecursos y advertencias he hecho a mis consejeros sobre esto y\r\nsignificado con vivo sentimiento el daño y encargado el reparo y aunque\r\nentiendo que en todos mis ministros debe ser igual a sus obligaciones la\r\natencion y celo á mi servicio, la experiencia me ha mostrado que no ha\r\nbastado esto y que es necesario usar de medio mas eficaz y poderoso para\r\nque no se acabe de perder mi monarquia, pues me corre obligacion por el\r\nlugar en que Dios me ha puesto atajar su total ruina y entiendo ser la\r\nfalta de obediencia y ejecucion lo que mas aprisa la puede causar.\r\n\r\nPor este he resuelto dar forma y regla en ello, disponiendose por\r\narancel como se han de ejecutar mis ordenes y penas en que se ha de\r\nincurrir por la inobservancia de ellas, segun la calidad de cada una, y\r\nasi se formara para ese Consejo el que la tocare bien ajustado, y se me\r\nenviará con distincion de las materias de oficio, hacienda y partes asi\r\nde gracia como de justicia, y de las penas en que han de incurrir todos\r\ny se han de executar por el mismo consejo correspondientes á la calidad\r\nde la inobservancia y omision en la ejecucion, previniendo bien todos\r\nlos casos en que cada uno puede faltar y aquellos casos que pueden\r\nofrecerse y se ofrecen, que no puedan ser comprendidos, tambien me los\r\nconsultará el consejo, porque quiero saber los que son, y los aranceles\r\nse hagan en veinte dias y se me envien para que resuelva la forma en que\r\nhan de quedar ajustados y se publiquen.\r\n\r\n(RUBRICA DEL REY).\r\n\r\nEn San Lorenzo á 15 de Octubre de 1633.\r\nAl Arzobispo inquisidor general.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION ON THE

D 118, and S 294 fol.\r\n122).\r\n\r\n(See p. 461).\r\n\r\nEn las ultimas cortes que se celebraron en Aragon el año pasado de 1646,\r\nfue servido su Magestad (Dios le guarde) de aminorar el numero de\r\nfamiliares que conforme á fueros de aquel Reyno podia haver,\r\nextinguiendole á solo numero de 400, caviendo mas de 2000 en lo antiguo,\r\ny que se practicava como consta largamente por la concordia antigua\r\nentre el Reyno y la Inquisicion. Quitoles assimismo las exempciones de\r\nque gozaban dichos familiares en la forma que tanvien consta por los\r\nnuebos cabos donde se puede veer. Instaron sobre esto con apretadissimos\r\nesfuerzos los quatro brazos de dichas cortes y entre ellos algunos\r\nministros de Inquisicion (que aun no vasto el serlo para que dejasen de\r\nmanifestar el odio comun que contra ella y sus actiones tienen).\r\nConociaselo su Magestad y antes de concederles cosa alguna que tocase á\r\nla Inquisicion (de quien dijo era las niñas de sus ojos) les mando ó\r\npidió la dejasen en el estado que estava, y que como no le llegasen á\r\nella concederia todo lo demas que pretendian, haciendo assimismo\r\nmercedes particulares á los Aragoneses, como con efecto les hiço mas de\r\ntrecientas y sesenta que se publicaron en un dia, nombrandolas y las\r\npersonas á quien las hacia. Nada de esto vasto para que dejasen de\r\nreplicar con una y otra embaxada por parte de los brazos, deteniendo á\r\nsu Magestad dos ó tres dias en el conbento de Santa Engracia de\r\nZaragoza, estando el coche á la puerta para venirse á Madrid, hasta que\r\nviendo su pertinacia y que sin duda le detendrian mas sin concluir el\r\nsolio en las Cortes que era lo que esperava, les concedió todo lo que en\r\nesta parte quisieron. Quedaron los Aragoneses muy contentos,\r\npareciendoles haver vencido lo mas y que ya le faltava al Rey el unico\r\nrecursso que tenia en aquel Reyno. Desde este dia fue postrandose la\r\nautoridad y mucha estimacion que la Inquisicion tenia en Aragon,\r\nexcediendo en esta parte á otros, pues tal vez miraban á un Inquisidor\r\ncon mas veneracion que al Arçobispo y Virrey y oy se vee lo contrario y\r\naun se oye que algunos dicen ya se acabo la Inquisicion.

Sera bien y assi os lo encargo que procureis componer\r\nesto de manera que los Inquisidores no se metan en mas de lo que les\r\ntoca y que al mismo tiempo que yo mandare escribir a los obispos\r\nescribais vos a las Inquisiciones que por ningun casso se metan en cossa\r\nque derechamente no les toque, apercibiendoles que no solamente no lo\r\nconsentireis pero que castigareis á los que hicieren lo contrario con\r\ndemonstracion de rigor, y si excedieren no os contenteis con\r\nreprehenderlos blandamente sino que con effecto los castigueis, porque\r\ncon esto se justificara lo que yo escribiere á los perlados y ellos se\r\nacomodaran á lo que fuere justo, y de otra manera tendran ocasion de\r\nacudir á mi por el remedio de sus agravios, lo cual es necesario que se\r\nescuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Romancero del Cid, pp. 12, 74, 77, 79, 87, 88, etc. (Frankofurto,\r\n1828).--Crónica de Alfonso VII, 138-141 (Florez, España Sagrada, XXI,\r\n403)--\r\n\r\n\"Castellæ vires per sæcula fucre rebelles: Inclyta Castella ciens\r\nsævissima bella Vix cuiquam regum voluit submittere collum: Indomite\r\nvixit, coeli lux quandiu luxit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] Fuero Viejo de Castiella, Lib.

As Cardinal Ximenes says\r\nin his letter of advice to Cardinal Adrian as to the conduct of Charles\r\nV in taking possession of his inheritance, \"por lo qual fue ella tan\r\npoderosisima en su reyno, que todos del mayor á el menor temian _virgam\r\nferream_ de su justicia, y asi destruyó toda la tirannia.\" (Valladares,\r\nSemanario Erúdito, XX, 237).\r\n\r\n[73] Archivo Gen. de Simancas, Inquisicion Libros I, II.\r\n\r\n[74] The limitations on the royal jurisdiction are exemplified by the\r\nunseemly contest at Alcalá de Henares, in 1485-6, between Isabella and\r\nthe Archbishop González de Mendoza, respecting her right to administer\r\njustice within his province. It lasted from December till the time\r\nfor opening the campaign against Granada, when she removed to Córdova\r\nwithout having established her claim.--Francisco de Medina, Vida del\r\nCardenal Mendoza (Mem. hist, español, VI, 264).\r\n\r\nYet her jurisdiction was one of the points on which Isabella wisely\r\ninsisted with the utmost firmness. To quote Cardinal Ximenes\r\nagain--\"Ante todo la dicha Reyna cuidaba de defender su jurisdiccion\r\nReal, viendo que por ella los Reyes en Castilla se hacen mas poderosos y\r\nmas temidos de sus vasallos\" (Valladares, Semanario Erúdito, XX, 238).\r\nWhen, in 1491, the royal court at Valladolid, presided over by Alonzo de\r\nValdevielfo, Bishop of Leon, wrongfully allowed an appeal to Rome, she\r\npromptly dismissed the bishop and all the judges and replaced them with\r\nJuan Arias del Villar, Bishop of Oviedo, and other assessors.--Crónicon\r\nde Valladolid (Coleccion de Documentos para la Historia de España, XIII,\r\n184-5).--Galindez de Carbajal (Ibid.

In\r\n1386 they sent Sancho Rodríguez, one of their number, to Juan I to ask\r\nto be received back in Spain. Juan obtained from the King of Morocco\r\npermission for their departure, and promised to provide for them lands\r\nand support. In 1390 they came, numbering fifty cavaliers with their\r\nwives and children, and bringing a letter from the Moslem ruler speaking\r\nof them as nobles descended from the Goths and praising greatly their\r\nloyalty and valor. It was in riding out from Burgos to welcome them\r\nthat Juan's horse fell and caused his death. In 1394 Henry III gave\r\nthem a confirmation of their ancient nobility, and in 1430 and 1433\r\nwe still find them recognized in Seville as a distinct class.--Ayala,\r\nCrón. de Juan I, año X, cap. xx.--Zuñiga, Annales de Sevilla, Lib.

Even when celebrating their defeats, down to the\r\ncapture of Granada, there is no contempt manifested and nowhere is\r\nto be seen a trace of religious acerbity. Many ballads have Moors as\r\ntheir heroes, as in those which celebrate the deeds of Bravonel and\r\nReduan, and there is nothing to distinguish their treatment from that\r\nof Christians. Bravonel and Bernardo del Carpio are represented as\r\ncompanions in arms. When Bernardo is banished by his king he betakes\r\nhimself forthwith to Granada to participate in a tournament, where\r\n\r\nQue hay unas Reales fiestas, Donde el premio será dado\r\n\r\nAl que mejor lo ficiere Sea Moro ó sea Cristiano;\r\n\r\nand there he is warmly welcomed by Muza, the most gallant knight of the\r\nSaracens.--Romances Antiguos Españoles, I, 65 (Leipzig, 1844).\r\n\r\n[151] Villanueva, Viage Literario, XVI, 159.\r\n\r\n[152] Dozy, Recherches, II, 203, 233.\r\n\r\n[153] Dozy, II, 109, 111.--Edélestand du Meril, Poésies populaires\r\nLatines, pp. 312-13.\r\n\r\n[154] Chron.

Acad. de la Historia, VIII, 40).\r\n\r\nThe Church held that baptism manumitted the slave, even when the master\r\nwas Christian, but when it sought to enforce the rule the masters\r\nresisted, either forbidding the baptism or demanding from the clergy the\r\nvalue of the slave and seizing pledges to ensure payment. Innocent III\r\nwas much scandalized by this. In 1205 he complained to Alfonso IX that\r\nin place of requiring such converted slaves to be paid for at the price\r\nfixed by the canons he allowed the owner to determine the value, and\r\nthus the Bishop of Burgos had recently been forced to pay two hundred\r\ngold pieces for a girl not worth ten deniers (Innoc.

Ice Gebir's _Suma de los principales Mandamientos_ was written\r\nin 1462. It would not be easy to find a more practical moral code than\r\nthat presented in the short precepts assembled in Ice Gebir's first\r\nchapter (pp. 250 _sqq._). It is somewhat surprising to learn that in\r\nthe _alchihéd_, or holy war against Christians, it was forbidden to\r\nslay non-combatants--women, children, old men and even monks and friars\r\nunless they defended themselves by force (cap. xxxv, p. 333). Even\r\nharmless things, such as ants and frogs, are not to be deprived of life\r\n(cap. clvii, p. 400). The vital reproach to be brought against Islam\r\nis the position assigned to woman--her degradation in her relations to\r\nman, and her scant recognition as a human being. In a classification\r\nof society into twelve orders, the eleventh is that of _baldios_ or\r\nrobbers, sorcerers, pirates, drunkards, etc., and the twelfth and lowest\r\nis woman (Ib. cap. lx, pp. 412, 415).\r\n\r\n[196] The ballad chronicler relates how--\r\n\r\nEt los moros é las moras Muy grandes juegos hacian, Los judíos con las\r\ntoras Estos Reyes bien recibian.

How unfitted was the Castilian chivalry to perpetuate\r\nthis prosperity is seen in a letter of Alfonso X in 1258, reciting how\r\nhe had peopled with Christians the flourishing city of Alicante, as it\r\nwas a stronghold and one of the best seaports; how the allotment of\r\nlands had given dissatisfaction and on investigation he had found that\r\nthe Christians could not live and prosper there, wherefore he now makes\r\na new _repartimiento_ (Memorial histórico español, I, 135).\r\n\r\n[202] Fernández y González, pp. 294, 321, 367.

This device originated among the Saracens of the East, who, in\r\nthe eleventh century, required Jews and Christians to wear distinctive\r\nbadges (Fernández y González, p. 16). The earliest trace of it in\r\nthe West is found in the charter of Alais, in 1200, which prescribes\r\ndistinctive vestments for Jews (Robert, Les Signes d'Infamie au\r\nMoyen Age, p. 7). In Italy, Frederic II obeyed the Lateran decree by\r\nordering, in 1221, all Jews to wear distinguishing garments (Richardi\r\nde S. German. Chron. _ap._ Muratori, S. R. I., VII, 993), but he did\r\nnot insert this in the Sicilian Constitutions or include his Saracen\r\nsubjects. In 1254 the council of Albi prescribed for Jews a circle,\r\na finger-breadth in width, to be worn upon the breast, and that of\r\nRavenna, in 1311, a yellow circle (Harduin. VII, 458, 1370). In the\r\nfifteenth century, the Neapolitan Jews were required to wear as a sign\r\nthe Hebrew letter Tau (Wadding, Annal. Minor. T. III, Regest. p. 392).\r\n\r\n[204] Raynald.

It was apparently in\r\nreturn for a tithe of ecclesiastical revenues that Jaime pledged himself\r\nto the pope to expel the Moors, but he was too wise a statesman to do\r\nso, and as late as 1275 he invited additional settlers by the promise\r\nof a year's exemption from taxation. On his death-bed in 1276, however,\r\npartly, no doubt in consequence of a dangerous Moorish revolt, and\r\npartly owing to the awakened fears shown by his taking the Cistercian\r\nhabit, he enjoined his son Pedro to fulfil the promise, and in a codicil\r\nto his will he emphatically repeated the request (Danvila y Collado, La\r\nExpulsion de los Moriscos, p. 24.--Swift, James the First of Aragon, pp.\r\n140, 253, 290), but Pedro was obdurate.\r\n\r\n[211] Fernández y González, p. 109.\r\n\r\n[212] Constitt.

In 1331 the Córtes\r\nof Madrid ineffectually petitioned that Christians denying debts to\r\nJews could offer another Christian as a witness and not be obliged to\r\nhave a Jew. The Fuero Viejo de Castiella, as revised in 1356, however,\r\ngrants the privilege (Lib. III, Tit. iv, ley 19). The editors of the\r\nFuero, Asso and Manuel (Ed. 1847, p. 83) say that the practice varied,\r\nand that Henry III, in the Córtes of Madrid, in 1405, again granted the\r\nprivilege. As early as 1263 Alfonso X had enacted that in mixed suits\r\na Jew could not demand that his opponent should produce as witnesses a\r\nChristian and a Jew, but that the evidence of two good Christians should\r\nsuffice.--Memorial histórico español, I, 207.

Porque por\r\nesperiencia parece que todo el daño que en los cristianos se ha fallado\r\ndel delicto de la heregia ha procedido de la conversacion y practica que\r\ncon los judios han recebido las personas de su linage, ningun tan comodo\r\nremedio hay como apartarlo dentre ellos de la manera que se ha fecho\r\nen el arzobispo de Sevilla e obispados de Córdova e de Jaen, e pues\r\nen essa ciudad tanto e mas que en ninguna otra han dañado, es nuestra\r\nvoluntad que los judios dessa ciudad luego sean desterrados dessa dicha\r\nciudad e de todo el arzobispado de Çaragoça e obispado de Santa María de\r\nAlbarracin como por el devoto padre Prior de Santa Cruz vos sera escrito\r\ne mandado.\"--Archivo gén. de la C. de Aragon, Regist. 3684, fol. 96.\r\n\r\nWhile this is apparently confined to the Saragossa Jews, a letter of\r\nFerdinand to Torquemada, July 22, 1486, alludes to the Jews of Teruel\r\nhaving been ordered by the inquisitors to depart within three months.\r\nHe deems them justified in complaining that the term is too short,\r\nseeing that they have to pay and collect their debts and sell their\r\nhouses and lands and he therefore suggests an extension of six months\r\nadditional.--See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[383] Zurita, Hist. del Rey Hernando, Lib.

It can be studied with\r\naccuracy in the records of the trial of one of the accused, Jucé Franco,\r\nprinted by Padre Fidel Fita (Boletin, XI, 1887) with ample elucidations.\r\nThe Catalan version of the sentence is in _Coleccion de Documentos de\r\nla Corona de Aragon_, XXVIII, 68. For the legend and cult of the Santo\r\nNiño see Martínez Moreno, _Historia del Martirio del Santo Niño de la\r\nGuardia_, Madrid, 1866.\r\n\r\n[388] Páramo (p. 144) seems to be the earliest authority for this story\r\nand, as he tells it, it seems rather applicable to an attempt of the\r\nConversos to buy off the Inquisition, but modern writers attribute it to\r\nthe Jewish expulsion.

The Judaizing Christians\r\nwere also sometimes called _Alboraycos_, from _alborak_ (the lightning),\r\nthe marvellous horse brought to Mahomet by the angel Gabriel, which was\r\nneither a horse nor a mule nor male nor female (Ibid. p. 379). A still\r\nmore abusive popular appellation was _Marrano_, which means both hog\r\nand accursed. For the controverted derivation of the word see Graetz,\r\n_Geschichte der Juden_, VIII, 76 (Ed. 1890), who also (p. 284) admits\r\nthe attachment of many of the Conversos to the old religion.\r\n\r\n[420] C.

Chr. Wolff (Bibl. Hebrææ II, 1123) points\r\nout that he nowhere alludes to his own experience as he could scarce\r\nhave failed to do when accusing the Jews of matters which they denied.\r\nHe cites (fol. cxlix^{a}) Pablo de Santa María, Bishop of Burgos, for\r\ntheir prayers against Christians and another learned Converso as to a\r\nsecret connected with the Hebrew letters (fol. xciv^{a}). His knowledge\r\nconcerning the Jews was thus wholly at second hand and his assaults on\r\nthe Judaizing of the Conversos have every appearance of emanating from\r\nan Old Christian.\r\n\r\n[430] The prayers attributed to the Jews were the subject of repeated\r\nrepressive legislation.

This was done at the request of Filippo\r\nde'Barbarj, subsequently Inquisitor of Sicily, then at the court, whom\r\nboth monarchs qualify as their confessor. He is said to have exercised\r\nconsiderable influence with them in overcoming the opposition to the\r\nestablishment of the Inquisition in Castile.

It had previously been looked upon as lost. Its main\r\nprovisions, however, are embodied in the cédula of Dec. 27, 1480,\r\nprinted in the notes to the Novísima Recopilacion, Ed. 1805, Tom. I, p.\r\n260.\r\n\r\nIt is a little singular that the Inquisition possessed very few\r\ndocuments relating to its early history. In an elaborate _consulta_ of\r\nJuly 18, 1703, presented to Philip V on the affair of Fray Froilan Diaz,\r\nthe Suprema states that it had had all the records searched with little\r\nresult; many important papers had been sent to Aragon and Catalonia\r\nand had never been returned; the rest were in a chest delivered to\r\nthe Count of Villalonga, secretary of Philip III, to arrange and\r\nclassify and on his arrest and the sequestration of his effects they\r\ndisappeared.--Biblioteca Nacional, Seccion de MSS., G, 61, fol. 198.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that the contents of the chest form the \"Bulario\r\nde la Inquisicion perteneciente á la Orden de Santiago,\" consisting of\r\neight Libros, or folio volumes (five of originals and three of copies)\r\nnow in the Archivo Histórico Nacional. It is from this collection that\r\nPadre Fita has printed the proclamation above alluded to and many other\r\nimportant documents, and it will be seen that I have made large use of\r\nit under the name of \"_Bulario de la Orden de Santiago_.\" There are also\r\nvast stores of records in the Archivo Histórico Nacional of Madrid,\r\nin the archives of Simancas and Barcelona, and some in the Vatican\r\nLibrary. Llorente burnt many papers before leaving Madrid and carried\r\nothers to Paris, some of which are in the Bibliothèque Nationale, _fonds\r\nespagnol_. The Biblioteca Nacional of Madrid also has a large number and\r\nothers are dispersed through the various libraries of Europe or are in\r\nprivate hands.\r\n\r\n[453] See his brief of January 29, 1482, printed by Llorente, Historia\r\nCrítica, Append. n. 1.\r\n\r\n[454] History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages, I, 331.\r\n\r\n[455] Archivo General de la Corona de Aragon, Reg. 3684, fol. 1.

The castle of Triana continued to be the\r\nseat of the Inquisition of Seville until 1626, when it was threatened\r\nwith ruin by the inundations of the Guadalquivir, and the tribunal\r\nwas removed to the palace of the Caballeros Tellos Taveros in the\r\nColacion de San Marcos. In 1639 it returned to the castle, which had\r\nbeen repaired and it remained there until 1789, when the continual\r\nencroachment of_the river caused its transfer to the Colegio known as\r\nlas Becas.--Varflora, Compendio histórico-descriptivo de Sevilla, P.

Rainaldo Romero, Bishop of Tiberias, secured for\r\nher entrance into a convent, but it can readily be understood that life\r\nthere was not rendered pleasant to her and she quitted it, without\r\ntaking the vows, to follow a career of shame. Her beauty disappeared and\r\nshe died in want, leaving directions that her skull should be placed as\r\na warning over the door of the house which had been the scene of her\r\ndisorderly life. Her wishes were obeyed and it is still to be seen in\r\nthe Calle del Artaud, near its entrance, hard by the Alcázar.--Amador de\r\nlos Rios, III, 249.\r\n\r\n[460] Bernaldez, cap. xliv.

Colmenares (Hist. de Segovia, cap. xxxiv, §\r\n18) asserts it positively, but the only tribunals represented in\r\nthe assembly of organization, held in November, 1484, were Seville,\r\nCórdova, Jaen and Ciudad-Real. There was at first some resistance at\r\nSegovia on the part of the bishop, Juan Arias Dávila, who was of Jewish\r\ndescent.--Bergenroth, Calendar of Spanish State Papers, I, xlv.\r\n\r\nIn Ciudad-Real, the earliest inquisitors, in 1483, were the Licentiate\r\nPedro Díaz de la Costana and the Doctor Francisco de la Fuente\r\n(Archivo hist. nacional, Inquisicion de Toledo, Legajo 154, n. 375).\r\nNeither of these was a Dominican and the latter subsequently became an\r\ninquisitor-general and bishop successively of Avila and of Córdova.\r\n\r\nIn Córdova the Inquisition was established in 1482, with four\r\ninquisitors--the Bachilleres Anton Rúiz de Morales and Alvar González\r\nde Capillas, Doctor Pedro Martínez de Barrio, and Fray Martin Cazo,\r\nGuardian of the Franciscan convent. The first auto de fe was celebrated\r\nin 1483, when one of the victims was the concubine of the treasurer of\r\nthe cathedral, Pedro Fernández de Alcaudete, who himself was burnt on\r\nFebruary 28, 1484.

These had been largely\r\nin the hands of Conversos, causing so much jealousy that the prospect\r\nof acquiring them led numbers of aspirants to wish for the sharpest and\r\nspeediest action. It was too slow for their eagerness and expectative\r\ngrants were sought for and made in advance so as to profit by the next\r\nvictim. The vacancies passed into the hands of the receivers and were\r\ndistributed by the sovereigns as favor or policy might dictate. See\r\nAppendix for suggestive extracts from the register of the receiver of\r\nValencia.\r\n\r\nA significant case is that of Juan Cardona, public scrivener and notary\r\nof mortmains, who became disqualified by the condemnation of the memory\r\nof his father, Leonardo Cardona, whereupon Ferdinand treated his offices\r\nas confiscated and, by cédula of December 5, 1511, bestowed them on Juan\r\nArgent, notary of the tribunal which had rendered the sentence.--Archivo\r\nde Simancas, Inquisicion, Libro III, fol. 33, 161.\r\n\r\n[529] Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Libro I.\r\n\r\n[530] Archivo de Simancas, Patronato Real, Inquisicion, Leg. único, fol.\r\n46.--Juan Gomez Bravo, Catálogo de los Obispos de Córdova, I, 392.\r\n\r\nIn 1513 an attempt was made to review the trial of the parents and son,\r\nwhen Ferdinand summoned the Royal Council to sit with the Suprema in\r\nthe case showing his determination that the sentence should not be set\r\naside (Archivo de Simancas, Inq., Libro 9, fol. 146).

He was the _âme damnée_\r\nof Ferdinand who corresponded with him confidentially when he wanted\r\nanything done. His fidelity was stimulated with favors, as when in\r\nDecember, 1513, Ferdinand gave him an order on the receiver of Seville\r\nfor 300,000 mrs. (Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Lib. 9, fol. 145).\r\nLas Casas, however, expresses a favorable opinion of him and he was one\r\nof the executors of Isabella's testament.--Hist. de las Indias, Lib.\r\nIII, cap. 138 (Coleccion de Documentos, LXVI, 81).\r\n\r\n[567] Pet.

The learned Javier\r\nde Quinto (Discursos políticos, Madrid, 1848) had not seen Soranzo's\r\nstatement when he proved that this formula was invented by Hotman in\r\nhis _Franco Gallia_, first printed in 1573. On the other hand there is\r\nnothing of the kind in the oath of allegiance taken to Charles V in\r\n1518, though he was obliged first to swear to observe the fueros and\r\nprivileges of the land.--Argensola, Añales de Aragon, Lib. 1, cap. lx.\r\n\r\nA good account of the ancient constitution of Aragon will be found in\r\nSwift's \"Life and Times of James the First, King of Aragon,\" London,\r\n1894.\r\n\r\n[607] Monteiro, Historia da Santa Inquisiçaõ, II, 340.\r\n\r\n[608] Archivio Vaticano, Sisto IV, Registro 674, T.

A\r\nbrief of Sixtus IV, Jan. 21, 1479 (Ripoll, III, 572), to the Dominican\r\nGeneral, recites that his predecessor had appointed, some years\r\npreviously, Jaime Borell as inquisitor of Valencia, who had recently\r\nbeen removed without cause by Miguel de Mariello, Provincial of Aragon,\r\nand replaced by Juan Marques. Sixtus now orders Marques ejected and\r\nBorell restored.

Gen. de la C. de\r\nA., Reg. 3684, fol. 90.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that there may have been some rancor on Ferdinand's part\r\nagainst Gualbes who, as an eloquent preacher and fervid popular orator,\r\nhad done much, in 1461, to stimulate the resistance of the Catalans to\r\nJuan II, after the death of the heir-apparent, Carlos Prince of Viana,\r\nwhich was attributed to poison administered by Queen Juana Henríquez to\r\nopen for her son Ferdinand the path to the throne (Zurita, Añales, Lib.\r\nXVII, cap. xxvi, xlii; Lib.

A papal brief even ordered the removal from the cathedral\r\nof the sanbenitos of the assassins and strenuous efforts were required\r\nto procure its revocation.\r\n\r\nRepeated investigations were made by successive popes without result--at\r\nthe request of Charles V in 1537; of Philip III in 1604, 1615 and 1618;\r\nof Philip IV in 1622 and 1652, until at length in 1664 he was beatified\r\n(Trasmiera, pp. 98, 99, 133, 137, 139). The matter then rested for two\r\ncenturies until, in 1864, it was taken up again and finally, June 29,\r\n1867, he was canonized by Pius IX (Dom. Bartolini, Comment. Actor.\r\nOmnium Canonizationis, Romæ, 1868).\r\n\r\nIt is significant that the Inquisition did not await the tardy action\r\nof Rome. Instructions of the Suprema in 1603, 1623 and 1633 show that\r\nhis feast was regularly celebrated with prescribed offices (MSS. of\r\nRoyal Library of Copenhagen, 218^{b}, p. 257) and, during the 17th and\r\n18th centuries, he is constantly spoken of, in the documents of the\r\nInquisition relating to the feast, as San Pedro Arbués.\r\n\r\n[655] Memoria de diversos Autos, Auto 25 (Appendix).\r\n\r\n[656] Zurita, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[657] Memoria, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[658] Gams, Zur Geschichte der spanischen Staatsinquisition, p.\r\n34.--Bibl. nationale de France, fonds espagnol, 81.\r\n\r\n[659] This brief is printed in the Boletin, XVI, 368 by Padre Fidel\r\nFita, who is in error in assuming its obedience in France from the case\r\nof Juan de Pedro Sánchez, reported in an essay of mine on the Martyrdom\r\nof Arbués. This was merely an instance of friendly co-operation between\r\nthe Inquisitions of Toulouse and Saragossa and occurred too early to be\r\nthe result of the papal letters which were not received in Córdova until\r\nMay 31, 1487.\r\n\r\nWe have seen (p. 191), by a case occurring in 1501, that Manoel of\r\nPortugal considered that there was no obligation to return fugitives\r\nfrom the Inquisition; it was a matter of comity to be decided on the\r\nmerits of each case. There was a similar one in 1500, and when, in 1510\r\nand 1514, fugitives were asked for, under plea that they were wanted as\r\nwitnesses, Manoel refused to surrender them without absolute pledges\r\nthat they should suffer no harm (Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Libro\r\n1; Libro 3, fol. 85, 107, 110).\r\n\r\nWhen Portugal obtained an Inquisition, the two inquisitors-general, in\r\n1544, came to an agreement, with the assent of the respective monarchs,\r\nwhich superseded extradition. The fugitive was to be tried in the\r\ncountry where he was captured and the Inquisition from which he had fled\r\nwas to furnish the evidence.--Bibl. nacional, Seccion de MSS.

It was Martin de Santangel, not\r\nLuis, who took refuge in Tudela. He was not caught, but was burnt in\r\neffigy, July 28, 1486.\r\n\r\n[663] Memoria de diversos Autos, Auto 29 (Appendix).\r\n\r\nIn after years, Ferdinand was less inclined to invade friendly\r\nterritory. February 25, 1501, writing to the Archdeacon of Almazan,\r\nInquisitor of Catalayud, about an inhabitant of Fitero, a town just\r\nbeyond the border, he says that if the culprit can be arrested within\r\nhis jurisdiction it can be done, but there must be no deceit and no\r\nscandal.--Archivo de Simancas, Inquisicion, Libro 1.\r\n\r\n[664] Zurita, Añales, Lib.

Subsequently it was transferred to the archiepiscopal\r\npalace in order to let the Aljafería be occupied by a member of the\r\nroyal family, but the inquisitors complained and were allowed to return\r\nin 1498. They encroached upon the royal apartments, much to Ferdinand's\r\ndisgust, as expressed in a letter of September 30, 1511. In January,\r\n1515, he ordered them to leave the palace and rent accommodations in\r\nthe city, but finally they obtained permanent possession.--Archivo de\r\nSimancas, Inquisicion, Libro 1; Libro 3, fol. 155, 321, 322.\r\n\r\n[668] Arch. gén. de la C. de A., Reg. 3684, fol. 76.\r\n\r\n[669] Memoria de diversos Autos, Auto 27, n. 3 (see Appendix).\r\n\r\n[670] Memoria de diversos Autos, Autos 10, 11, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22\r\n(Appendix).\r\n\r\n[671] Bibl. nacionale de France, fonds espagnol, 81.--Memoria de\r\ndiversos Autos, Auto 43, n. 6; Auto 45, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[672] Libro Verde (Revista de España, CVI, 287, 589.--Ibid.

Chap. VI,\r\nArt. v, n. 1) that the executions numbered more than 200 and so does\r\nAmador de los Rios (III, 266) in saying that the greater part of those\r\nwho appeared in the Saragossa autos from 1486 to 1492 were accomplices\r\nin the murder. The sentences abstracted in the _Memoria_ show that but\r\nfew of them were concerned in it.\r\n\r\nAnchias, the notary of the tribunal, in his account of the affair, only\r\nenumerates as put to death three treasurers of the fund, five assassins\r\nand four accomplices besides Sancho de Paternoy and Alonso de Alagon\r\nwho escaped with imprisonment through friendly influences (Libro Verde,\r\nRevista, CVI, 287). The indications in the _Memoria_ are incomplete as,\r\nafter May, 1489, the crimes of the culprits are not stated but, so far\r\nas it goes and comparing it with the Libro Verde and other sources, I\r\nfind nine executed in person, besides two suicides, thirteen burnt in\r\neffigy and four penanced for complicity. Besides these are two penanced\r\nfor suborning false witness in favor of Luis de Santangel and seventeen\r\nfor aiding or sheltering the guilty, and two for rejoicing at the crime.\r\nAltogether, fifty or sixty will probably cover the total of those who\r\nsuffered in various ways.\r\n\r\nThe sanbenitos of the convicts, with inscriptions, were hung as\r\ncustomary in the cathedral and remain there to the present day (Amador\r\nde los Rios, III, 266). The swords of the murderers are still to be\r\nseen attached to the pillars near the entrance to the chancel (V. de\r\nla Fuente, in Oviedo's _Quinquagenas_, I, 73). One of the latter was\r\nremoved in 1518, by order of Leo X, and when the commissioner who had\r\nperformed the act died shortly afterward it was popularly regarded as\r\na visitation of God (Archivo hist. nacional, Inquisicion de Toledo,\r\nHacienda, Legajo 10).\r\n\r\n[675] Libro Verde (Revista, CVI, 250-1).--Archivo de Simancas,\r\nInquisicion, Libro 1--Arch. gén. de la C. de A., Reg. 3684, fol.\r\n100.--Garibay, Compendio histórial, Lib.

In some cases however of wounding\r\nor threatening witnesses, the galleys were substituted for capital\r\npunishment. There was, moreover, a spirit of conciliation in the Roman\r\nInquisition offering a marked contrast to that of Spain.

Familiars had no exemption from public burdens or duties or\r\nmilitary service and were subject to the secular courts in all criminal\r\ncases. When, in 1633, those of Jesi asked to have their civil suits\r\ntried by the Inquisition, the Congregation did not even answer them. The\r\nonly officials entitled to the _forum_ were those in continual active\r\nservice, and there is nothing said about wives, children and servants\r\nsharing in the privilege. As in Spain, the number of familiars was\r\nexcessive. Faenza was allowed 50, Ancona 40 and Rimini 30.--Decret.\r\nSacr. Congr. S^{ti} Officii, pp. 197-8, 200 (R.

In 1614 a chronicler states that since\r\nthe recent doubling of the nominal value of the _cuartos_ five or six\r\nmillions in vellón money had been brought from England and Holland,\r\nstowed in vessels under wheat. It was exchanged for silver at 30 per\r\ncent. discount and the silver exported. The remedy devised was to bring\r\ninland twenty leagues from the coast the foreign traders engaged in the\r\nbusiness, but this remedy was found to be worse than the disease and was\r\nabandoned (Cabrera, Relaciones, pp. 551, 553). We shall see hereafter\r\nthat the Inquisition was invoked to put an end to this traffic.\r\n\r\n[1336] Under these perpetual changes it will be readily understood how\r\ndifficult it is to estimate values at any special period. In a document\r\nof 1670 I find the _doblon_ converted into _reales de vellón_ at the\r\nrate of 1 to 81, although in this case the _doblon_ was of 4 _pesos_\r\nor 32 _reales de plata_. Similar to this is the conversion in another\r\nitem of 162 _reales de plata_ into 405 _reales de vellón_, showing that\r\nvellón was at a discount of 60 per cent. or specie at a premium of\r\n150.--Arch. de Simancas, Inquisicion, Leg. 1476, fol. 2, 61.\r\n\r\nThe unutterable confusion produced by these sudden and arbitrary changes\r\nin the legal value of the coinage is illustrated by a contention, in\r\n1683, between the auditor-general and the receiver-general of the\r\nSuprema, respecting the accountability of the latter for funds on hand\r\nand receipts and payments at the time when the _pragmática_ of February\r\n10, 1680, went into effect, involving points of which the equities were\r\nnot easy to determine.--Ibid., Leg. 1480, fol. 129.\r\n\r\n[1337] It was probably from this that the custom arose in giving\r\nreceipts for money to reserve or to renounce, as the case might be,\r\n\"_las leyes y excepciones de la non numerata pecunia_.\"\r\n\r\n[1338] Full information as to the coinage of the fifteenth century will\r\nbe found in Saez, Demostracion del Valor de las Monedas que corrian\r\ndurante el Reinado de Don Enrique IV (Madrid, 1805).\r\n\r\nFor the subsequent period reference is made to the very voluminous\r\nseries of laws and decrees preserved in the _Nueva Recopilacion_, Lib.\r\nV, Tit. xxi; the _Autos Acordados_, Lib. V, Tit. xxi and xxii, and the\r\n_Novisima Recopilacion_, Lib. IX, Tit. xvii.\r\n\r\n[1339] These instructions are supplementary to those issued by the\r\nassembly of Inquisitors in Seville, Nov. 29, 1484. Some of them are\r\nprinted by Arguello, but they are not in the Granada edition of 1537 of\r\nthe Instructions.\r\n\r\n[1340] These instructions partly repeat and partly supplement those of\r\nDecember, 1484. So far as I am aware they are inedited. They are not in\r\nthe Granada edition of the Instructions, nor do they correspond with the\r\nfragments printed by Arguello (Instrucciones del Santo Oficio, Madrid,\r\n1630, fol. 16-23) as the Instructions of January, 1485, and by Llorente,\r\nAñales, I, 96-99, 388-94.\r\n\r\n[1341] Both the Granada edition of 1537 and Arguello print only the\r\nfirst four articles of these Instructions. Llorente describes them\r\n(Añales, I, 261) as being in seven articles of which the last two are\r\nnot in this original document.\r\n\r\n[1342] The date of Bologna fixes the time of this brief between Nov. 10,\r\n1506, when Julius II entered that city, and Feb. 22, 1507, when he left\r\nit.--Raynald. Annal. ann. 1506, n. 30; 1507, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[1343] The end of the document is torn.\r\n\r\n[1344] This MS. I procured from a bookseller in Madrid, and I know\r\nnothing of its _provenance_. It is in small quarto, with 62 unnumbered\r\npages of a handwriting which I should attribute to the seventeenth or\r\nearly eighteenth century; about three pages towards the middle are in a\r\ndifferent hand, with some blanks filled in by the scribe of the rest of\r\nthe MS., as though the copying had been entrusted to a second writer who\r\nhad proved unable to decypher the original. The record bears on its face\r\nevery mark of authenticity. There are occasional discrepancies in names\r\nand dates between it and the list at the end of the Libro Verde, but in\r\ngeneral they correspond, as it also does with such trials of the period\r\nas I have examined from the Llorente MSS. in the Bibliothèque Nationale.\r\nIt supplies much that is lacking, and the abstracts of the sentences of\r\nthe murderers of San Pedro Arbués are sufficient to render it a document\r\nof interest, besides the light which the sentences in general throw\r\nupon the business of the Inquisition. I transcribe in full the earlier\r\nportion, with the final \"Resumen.\" Of the remainder, which consists of\r\nlittle more than lists of names of convicts and penitents, I only give a\r\nsummary.\r\n\r\nThe MS. has much in common with the anonymous _Orígen de la Inquisicion_\r\ncited by Llorente (Añales, I, 76, 94, 114, etc.) which he says is in the\r\n_Academia de la Historia_ and was written in 1652.\r\n\r\n[1345] Amin was a kind of Jewish broth. In the trial of Juan de la\r\nCaballeria, in 1488, there is an allusion to \"hamin y otras potages de\r\nJudios.\"--MSS. Bib.
