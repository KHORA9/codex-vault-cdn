It is no disparagement\r\nto Holland’s merits, as a diligent and generally faithful translator,\r\nto say that his work is unsuited to the requirements of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn the present translation, the principal editions of Pliny have been\r\ncarefully consulted, and no pains have been spared, as a reference to\r\nthe Notes will show, to present to the reader the labours of recent\r\nCommentators, among whom stands pre-eminent the celebrated Cuvier.\r\nIt has been a primary object to bring to the illustration of the\r\nwork whatever was afforded by the progress of knowledge and modern\r\ndiscoveries in science and art. Without ample illustration, Pliny’s\r\nvaluable work would want much of the interest which belongs to it, and\r\npresent difficulties scarcely surmountable by any one who has not made\r\nthe Author his especial study.\r\n\r\nIn the first two Books, the text of Hardouin, as given in Lemaire’s\r\nedition (Paris, 1827), has been followed; in the remainder that of\r\nSillig (Gotha, 1851-3), excepting in some few instances, where, for\r\nreasons given in the Notes, it has been deemed advisable to depart from\r\nit. The first two Books, and portions of others, are the performance\r\nof the late Dr. Bostock, who contemplated a translation of the entire\r\nwork; but, unfortunately for the interests of science, he was not\r\npermitted to carry his design into execution.\r\n\r\nUpwards of a hundred pages had been printed off before the present\r\nTranslator entered on his duties; and as they had not the advantage\r\nof Dr. Bostock’s superintendence through the press, some trifling\r\noversights have occurred. These are, for the most part, corrected in a\r\nshort Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PLINY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaius Plinius Secundus was born either at Verona or Novum Comum[1],\r\nnow Como, in Cisalpine Gaul, in the year A.U.C. 776, and A.D. 23. It\r\nis supposed that his earlier years were spent in his native province;\r\nand that he was still a youth when he removed to Rome, and attended\r\nthe lectures of the grammarian Apion. It was in about his sixteenth\r\nyear that he there saw Lollia Paulina[2], as in the following she was\r\ndivorced by Caligula, and it was probably in his twentieth that he\r\nwitnessed the capture of a large fish at Ostia, by Claudius and his\r\nattendants[3], and in his twenty-second that he visited Africa[4],\r\nEgypt, and Greece.\r\n\r\nIn his twenty-third year Pliny served in Germany under the legatus\r\nPomponius Secundus, whose friendship he soon acquired, and was in\r\nconsequence promoted to the command of an _ala_, or troop of cavalry.\r\nDuring his military career he wrote a treatise (now lost) “On the Use\r\nof the Javelin by Cavalry,” and travelled over that country[5] as far\r\nas the shores of the German Ocean, besides visiting Belgic Gaul. In his\r\ntwenty-ninth year he returned to Rome, and applied himself for a time\r\nto forensic pursuits, which however he appears soon to have abandoned.\r\nAbout this time he wrote the life of his friend Pomponius, and an\r\naccount of the “Wars in Germany,” in twenty books, neither of which\r\nare extant. Though employed in writing a continuation of the “Roman\r\nHistory” of Aufidius Bassus, from the time of Tiberius, he judiciously\r\nsuspended its publication during the reign of Nero, who appointed him\r\nhis procurator in Nearer Spain, and not improbably honoured him with\r\nequestrian rank. It was during his sojourn in Spain that the death of\r\nhis brother-in-law, C. Cæcilius, left his nephew C. Plinius Cæcilius\r\nSecundus (the author of the Letters) an orphan; whom immediately upon\r\nhis return to Rome, A.D. 70, he adopted, receiving him and his widowed\r\nmother under his roof.\r\n\r\nHaving been previously known to Vespasian in the German wars, he was\r\nadmitted into the number of his most intimate friends, and obtained an\r\nappointment at court, the nature of which is not known, but Rezzonico\r\nconjectures that it was in connexion with the imperial treasury. Though\r\nPliny was on intimate terms also with Titus, to whom he dedicated his\r\nNatural History, there is little ground for the assertion, sometimes\r\nmade, that he served under him in the Jewish wars. His account of\r\nPalestine clearly shows that he had never visited that country. It was\r\nat this period that he published his Continuation of the History of\r\nAufidius Bassus.\r\n\r\nFrom the titles which he gives to Titus in the dedicatory preface, it\r\nis pretty clear that his Natural History was published A.D. 77, two\r\nyears before his death.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 73 or 74, he had been appointed by Vespasian præfect of the\r\nRoman fleet at Misenum, on the western coast of Italy. It was to this\r\nelevation that he owed his romantic death, somewhat similar, it has\r\nbeen remarked, to that of Empedocles, who perished in the crater of\r\nMount Ætna. The closing scene of his active life, simultaneously with\r\nthe destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii, cannot be better described\r\nthan in the language employed by his nephew in an Epistle to his friend\r\nTacitus the historian[6]:—“My uncle was at Misenum, where he was in\r\npersonal command of the fleet. On the ninth[7] day before the calends\r\nof September, at about the seventh hour, 1 P.M., my mother, observing\r\nthe appearance of a cloud of unusual size and shape, mentioned it to\r\nhim. After reclining in the sun he had taken his cold bath; he had then\r\nagain lain down and, after a slight repast, applied himself to his\r\nstudies. Immediately upon hearing this, he called for his shoes, and\r\nascended a spot from which he could more easily observe this remarkable\r\nphænomenon. The cloud was to be seen gradually rising upwards; though,\r\nfrom the great distance, it was uncertain from which of the mountains\r\nit arose; it was afterwards, however, ascertained to be Vesuvius. In\r\nappearance and shape it strongly resembled a tree; perhaps it was more\r\nlike a pine than anything else, with a stem of enormous length reaching\r\nupwards to the heavens, and then spreading out in a number of branches\r\nin every direction. I have little doubt that either it had been carried\r\nupwards by a violent gust of wind, and that the wind dying away, it had\r\nlost its compactness, or else, that being overcome by its own weight,\r\nit had decreased in density and become extended over a large surface:\r\nat one moment it was white, at another dingy and spotted, just as it\r\nwas more or less charged with earth or with ashes.\r\n\r\n“To a man so eager as he was in the pursuit of knowledge, this appeared\r\nto be a most singular phænomenon, and one that deserved to be viewed\r\nmore closely; accordingly he gave orders for a light Liburnian vessel\r\nto be got ready, and left it at my option to accompany him. To this\r\nhowever I made answer, that I should prefer continuing my studies; and\r\nas it so happened, he himself had just given me something to write.\r\nTaking his tablets with him, he left the house. The sailors stationed\r\nat Retina, alarmed at the imminence of the danger—for the village lay\r\nat the foot of the mountain, and the sole escape was by sea—sent to\r\nentreat his assistance in rescuing them from this frightful peril. Upon\r\nthis he instantly changed his plans, and what he had already begun\r\nfrom a desire for knowledge, he determined to carry out as a matter of\r\nduty. He had the gallies put to sea at once, and went on board himself,\r\nwith the intention of rendering assistance, not only to Retina, but\r\nto many other places as well; for the whole of this charming coast\r\nwas thickly populated. Accordingly he made all possible haste towards\r\nthe spot, from which others were flying, and steered straight onwards\r\ninto the very midst of the danger: so far indeed was he from every\r\nsensation of fear, that he remarked and had noted down every movement\r\nand every change that was to be observed in the appearance of this\r\nominous eruption. The ashes were now falling fast upon the vessels,\r\nhotter and more and more thickly the nearer they approached the shore;\r\nshowers of pumice too, intermingled with black stones, calcined and\r\nbroken by the action of the flames: the sea suddenly retreated from\r\nthe shore, where the debris of the mountain rendered landing quite\r\nimpossible. After hesitating for a moment whether or not to turn back,\r\nupon the pilot strongly advising him to do so:—“Fortune favours the\r\nbold[8],” said he, “conduct me to Pomponianus.” Pomponianus was then\r\nat Stabiæ, a place that lay on the other side of the bay, for in those\r\nparts the shores are winding, and as they gradually trend away, the sea\r\nforms a number of little creeks. At this spot the danger at present\r\nwas not imminent, but still it could be seen, and as it appeared to\r\nbe approaching nearer and nearer, Pomponianus had ordered his baggage\r\non board the ships, determined to take to flight, if the wind, which\r\nhappened to be blowing the other way, should chance to lull. The wind,\r\nbeing in this quarter, was extremely favourable to his passage, and my\r\nuncle soon arriving at Stabiæ, embraced his anxious friend, and did\r\nhis best to restore his courage; and the better to re-assure him by\r\nevidence of his own sense of their safety, he requested the servants\r\nto conduct him to the bath. After bathing he took his place at table,\r\nand dined, and that too in high spirits, or at all events, what equally\r\nshows his strength of mind, with every outward appearance of being so.\r\nIn the mean time vast sheets of flame and large bodies of fire were to\r\nbe seen arising from Mount Vesuvius; the glare and brilliancy of which\r\nwere beheld in bolder relief as the shades of night came on apace.\r\nMy uncle however, in order to calm their fears, persisted in saying\r\nthat this was only the light given by some villages which had been\r\nabandoned by the rustics in their alarm to the flames: after which he\r\nretired to rest, and soon fell fast asleep: for his respiration, which\r\nwith him was heavy and loud, in consequence of his corpulence, was\r\ndistinctly heard by the servants who were keeping watch at the door of\r\nthe apartment. The courtyard which led to his apartment had now become\r\nfilled with cinders and pumice-stones, to such a degree, that if he had\r\nremained any longer in the room, it would have been quite impossible\r\nfor him to leave it. On being awoke he immediately arose, and rejoined\r\nPomponianus and the others who had in the meanwhile been sitting up.\r\nThey then consulted together whether it would be better to remain in\r\nthe house or take their chance in the open air; as the building was\r\nnow rocking to and fro from the violent and repeated shocks, while the\r\nwalls, as though rooted up from their very foundations, seemed to be\r\nat one moment carried in this direction, at another in that. Having\r\nadopted the latter alternative, they were now alarmed at the showers\r\nof light calcined pumice-stones that were falling thick about them,\r\na risk however to which as a choice of evils they had to submit. In\r\ntaking this step I must remark that, while with my uncle it was reason\r\ntriumphing over reason, with the rest it was only one fear getting the\r\nbetter of the other. Taking the precaution of placing pillows on their\r\nheads, they tied them on with towels, by way of protection against\r\nthe falling stones and ashes. It was now day in other places, though\r\nthere it was still night, more dark and more profound than any ordinary\r\nnight; torches however and various lights in some measure served to\r\ndispel the gloom. It was then determined to make for the shore, and to\r\nascertain whether the sea would now admit of their embarking; it was\r\nfound however to be still too stormy and too boisterous to allow of\r\ntheir making the attempt. Upon this my uncle lay down on a sail which\r\nhad been spread for him, and more than once asked for some cold water,\r\nwhich he drank; very soon however, they were alarmed by the flames and\r\nthe sulphurous smell which announced their approach, upon which the\r\nothers at once took to flight, while my uncle arose leaning upon two\r\nof the servants for support. Upon making this effort, he instantly\r\nfell to the ground; the dense vapour having, I imagine, stopped the\r\nrespiration and suffocated him; for his chest was naturally weak and\r\ncontracted, and often troubled with violent palpitations. When day was\r\nat last restored, the third after the closing one of his existence,\r\nhis body was found untouched and without a wound; there was no change\r\nto be perceived in the clothes, and its appearance was rather that of\r\na person asleep than of a corpse. In the meantime my mother and myself\r\nwere at Misenum—that however has nothing to do with the story, as it\r\nwas only your wish to know the details connected with his death. I\r\nshall therefore draw to a conclusion. The only thing that I shall add\r\nis the assurance that I have truthfully related all these facts, of\r\nwhich I was either an eye-witness myself, or heard them at the time of\r\ntheir occurrence, a period when they were most likely to be correctly\r\nrelated. You of course will select such points as you may think the\r\nmost important. For it is one thing to write a letter, another to write\r\nhistory;—one thing to write for a friend, another to write for the\r\npublic. Farewell.”\r\n\r\nOf the mode of life pursued by Pliny, and of the rest of his works, an\r\nequally interesting account has been preserved by his nephew, in an\r\nEpistle addressed to Macer[9]. We cannot more appropriately conclude\r\nthan by presenting this Epistle to the reader:—“I am highly gratified\r\nto find that you read the works of my uncle with such a degree of\r\nattention as to feel a desire to possess them all, and that with this\r\nview you inquire, What are their names? I will perform the duties of\r\nan index then: and not content with that, will state in what order\r\nthey were written: for even that is a kind of information which is by\r\nno means undesirable to those who are devoted to literary pursuits.\r\nHis first composition was a treatise ‘on the use of the Javelin by\r\nCavalry,’ in one Book. This he composed, with equal diligence and\r\ningenuity, while he was in command of a troop of horse. His second\r\nwork was the ‘Life of Q. Pomponius Secundus,’ in two Books, a person\r\nby whom he had been particularly beloved.—These books he composed as\r\na tribute which was justly due to the memory of his deceased friend.\r\nHis next work was twenty Books on ‘the Wars in Germany,’ in which he\r\nhas compiled an account of all the wars in which we have been engaged\r\nwith the people of that country. This he had begun while serving in\r\nGermany, having been recommended to do so in a dream. For in his sleep\r\nhe thought that the figure of Drusus Nero[10] stood by him—the same\r\nDrusus, who after the most extensive conquests in that country, there\r\nmet his death. Commending his memory to Pliny’s attentive care, Drusus\r\nconjured him to rescue it from the decaying effect of oblivion. Next\r\nto these came his three books entitled ‘The Student’[11], divided,\r\non account of their great size, into six volumes. In these he has\r\ngiven instructions for the training of the orator, from the cradle to\r\nhis entrance on public life. In the latter years of Nero’s reign, he\r\nwrote eight books, ‘On Difficulties in the Latin Language[12];’ that\r\nbeing a period at which every kind of study, in any way free-spoken\r\nor even of elevated style, would have been rendered dangerous by the\r\ntyranny that was exercised. His next work was his ‘Continuation of the\r\nHistory of Aufidius Bassus,’ in thirty-one books; after which came\r\nhis ‘Natural History,’ in thirty-seven books, a work remarkable for\r\nits comprehensiveness and erudition, and not less varied than Nature\r\nherself. You will wonder how a man so occupied with business could\r\npossibly find time to write such a number of volumes, many of them\r\non subjects of a nature so difficult to be treated of. You will be\r\neven more astonished when you learn, that for some time he pleaded\r\nat the bar as an advocate, that he was only in his fifty-sixth year\r\nat the time of his death, and that the time that intervened was\r\nequally trenched upon and frittered away by the most weighty duties of\r\nbusiness, and the marks of favour shewn him by princes. His genius,\r\nhowever, was truly quite incredible, his zeal indefatigable, and his\r\npower of application wonderful in the extreme. At the festival of the\r\nVulcanalia[13], he began to sit up to a late hour by candle-light, not\r\nfor the purpose of consulting[14] the stars, but with the object of\r\npursuing his studies; while, in the winter, he would set to work at\r\nthe seventh hour of the night, or the eighth at the very latest, often\r\nindeed at the sixth[15]. By nature he had the faculty of being able to\r\nfall asleep in a moment; indeed, slumber would sometimes overtake him\r\nin his studies, and then leave him just as suddenly. Before daybreak,\r\nhe was in the habit of attending the Emperor Vespasian,—for he, too,\r\nwas one who made an excellent use of his nights,—and then betook\r\nhimself to the duties with which he was charged. On his return home,\r\nhe devoted all the time which was still remaining to study. Taking an\r\nearly repast, after the old fashion, light, and easy of digestion, in\r\nthe summer time, if he had any leisure to spare, he would lie down\r\nin the sun-shine, while some book was read to him, he himself making\r\nnotes and extracts in the meanwhile; for it was his habit never to\r\nread anything without making extracts, it being a maxim of his, that\r\nthere is no book so bad but that some good may be got out of it. After\r\nthus enjoying the sunshine, he generally took a cold bath; after which\r\nhe would sit down to a slight repast, and then take a short nap. On\r\nawaking, as though another day had now commenced, he would study till\r\nthe hour for the evening meal, during which some book was generally\r\nread to him, he making comments on it in a cursory manner. I remember,\r\non one occasion, a friend of his interrupting the reader, who had given\r\nthe wrong pronunciation to some words, and making him go over them\r\nagain. “You understood him, didn’t you?” said my uncle. “Yes,” said\r\nthe other. “Why, then, did you make him go over it again? Through this\r\ninterruption of yours, we have lost more than ten lines.” So thrifty\r\na manager was he of time! In summer he rose from the evening meal by\r\ndaylight; and, in winter, during the first hour of the night[16], just\r\nas though there had been some law which made it compulsory on him to\r\ndo so. This is how he lived in the midst of his employments, and the\r\nbustle of the city. When in retirement in the country, the time spent\r\nin the bath was the only portion that was not allotted by him to study.\r\nWhen I say in the bath, I mean while he was in the water; for while his\r\nbody was being scraped with the strigil and rubbed, he either had some\r\nbook read to him, or else would dictate himself. While upon a journey,\r\nas though relieved from every other care, he devoted himself to study,\r\nand nothing else. By his side was his secretary, with a book and\r\ntablets; and, in the winter time, the secretary’s hands were protected\r\nby gloves, that the severity of the weather might not deprive his\r\nmaster for a single moment of his services. It was for this reason also\r\nthat, when at Rome, he would never move about except in a litter. I\r\nremember that on one occasion he found fault with me for walking—“You\r\nmight have avoided losing all those hours,” said he; for he looked\r\nupon every moment as lost which was not devoted to study. It was by\r\nmeans of such unremitting industry as this that he completed so many\r\nworks, and left me 160 volumes of notes[17], written extremely small\r\non both sides, which in fact renders the collection doubly voluminous.\r\nHe himself used to relate, that when he was procurator in Spain, he\r\nmight have parted with his common-place book to Largius Licinius for\r\n400,000 sesterces; and at that time the collection was not so extensive\r\nas afterwards. When you come to think of how much he must have read, of\r\nhow much he has written, would you not really suppose that he had never\r\nbeen engaged in business, and had never enjoyed the favour of princes?\r\nAnd yet, on the other hand, when you hear what labour he expended\r\nupon his studies, does it not almost seem that he has neither written\r\nnor read enough? For, in fact, what pursuits are those that would not\r\nhave been interrupted by occupations such as his? While, again, what\r\nis there that such unremitting perseverance as his could not have\r\neffected? I am in the habit, therefore, of laughing at it when people\r\ncall me a studious man,—me who, in comparison with him, am a downright\r\nidler; and yet I devote to study as much time as my public engagements\r\non the one hand, and my duties to my friends on the other, will admit\r\nof. Who is there, then, out of all those who have devoted their whole\r\nlife to literature, that ought not, when put in comparison with him,\r\nto quite blush at a life that would almost appear to have been devoted\r\nto slothfulness and inactivity? But my letter has already exceeded its\r\nproper limits, for I had originally intended to write only upon the\r\nsubject as to which you made inquiry, the books of his composition\r\nthat he left. I trust, however, that these particulars will prove no\r\nless pleasing to you than the writings themselves; and that they will\r\nnot only induce you to peruse them, but excite you, by a feeling of\r\ngenerous emulation, to produce some work of a similar nature.—Farewell.”\r\n\r\nOf all the works written by Pliny, one only, the ‘Historia Naturalis’\r\nhas survived to our times. This work, however, is not a ‘Natural\r\nHistory’ in the modern acceptation of the term, but rather a vast\r\nEncyclopædia of ancient knowledge and belief upon almost every known\r\nsubject—“not less varied than Nature herself,” as his nephew says. It\r\ncomprises, within the compass of thirty-seven books, 20,000 matters of\r\nimportance, collected from about 2000 volumes (nearly all of which have\r\nnow perished), the works, as Pliny himself states, of 100 writers of\r\nauthority; together with a vast number of additional matters unknown to\r\nthose authorities, and many of them the results of his own experience\r\nand observation. Hardouin has drawn up a catalogue of the authors\r\nquoted by Pliny; they amount in number to between 400 and 500.\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief sketch of the plan of this wonderful monument\r\nof human industry. After a dedicatory Epistle to Titus, followed by a\r\ntable of contents of the other Books, which together form the First\r\nBook, the author proceeds to give an account of the prevailing notions\r\nas to the universe, the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the\r\nmore remarkable properties of the elements (_partes naturæ_). He then\r\npasses on to a geographical description of the face of the earth as\r\nknown to the ancients. After the Geography comes what may in strict\r\npropriety be termed “Natural History,” including a history of man,\r\nreplete indeed with marvels, but interesting in the highest degree.\r\nHaving mentioned at considerable length the land, animals, fishes,\r\nbirds, and insects, he passes on to Botany, which in its various\r\naspects occupies the larger portion of the work. At the same time,\r\nin accordance with his comprehensive plan, this part includes a vast\r\namount of information on numerous subjects, the culture of the cereals\r\nand the manufacture of oil, wine, paper (_papyrus_), and numerous\r\nother articles of daily use. After treating at considerable length\r\nof Medical Botany, he proceeds to speak of medicaments derived from\r\nthe human body, from which he branches off into discussions on the\r\nhistory of medicine, and magic, which last he looks upon as an offshoot\r\nfrom the medical art; and he takes this opportunity of touching upon\r\nmany of the then current superstitions and notions on astrology. He\r\nconcludes this portion of his work with an account of the medicinal\r\nproperties of various waters, and of those of fishes and other aquatic\r\nanimals. He then presents us with a treatise on Mineralogy, in which\r\nhe has accumulated every possible kind of information relative to the\r\nuse of gold, silver, bronze, and other metals; a subject which not\r\nunnaturally leads him into repeated digressions relative to money,\r\njewels, plate, statues, and statuaries. Mineral pigments next occupy\r\nhis attention, with many interesting notices of the great painters\r\nof Greece; from which he passes on to the various kinds of stone and\r\nmaterials employed in building, and the use of marble for the purposes\r\nof sculpture, including a notice of that art and of the most eminent\r\nsculptors. The last Book is devoted to an account of gems and precious\r\nstones, and concludes with an eulogium on his native country, as alike\r\ndistinguished for its fertility, its picturesque beauties, and the\r\nnatural endowments and high destinies of its people.\r\n\r\nFrom the writings of Pliny we gather of course a large amount of\r\ninformation as to his opinions and the constitution of his mind.\r\nHis credulity, it must be admitted, is great in the extreme;\r\nthough, singularly enough, he severely taxes the Greeks with the\r\nsame failing[18]. Were we not assured from other sources that he\r\nwas eminently successful in life, was in the enjoyment of opulence,\r\nand honoured with the favour and confidence of princes[19], the\r\nremarks which he frequently makes on human life, in the Seventh Book\r\nmore especially, would have led us to the conclusion that he was\r\na disappointed man, embittered against his fellow-creatures, and\r\ndissatisfied with the terms on which the tenure of life is granted\r\nto us. He opens that Book with a preface replete with querulous\r\ndissatisfaction and repinings at the lot of man—the only ‘tearful’\r\nanimal—he says[20]. He repines at the helpless and wretched condition\r\nof the infant at the moment it is ushered into life, and the numerous\r\npains and vices to which it is doomed to be subject.—Man’s liability\r\nto disease is with him a blemish in the economy of nature:—“life,”\r\nhe says, “this gift of nature, however long it may be, is but too\r\nuncertain and too frail; to those even to whom it is most largely\r\ngranted, it is dealt out with a sparing and niggardly hand, if we\r\nonly think of eternity[21].” As we cannot have life on our own terms,\r\nhe does not think it worthy of our acceptance, and more than once\r\nexpresses his opinion that the sooner we are rid of it the better.\r\nSudden death he looks upon as a remarkable phænomenon, but, at the\r\nsame time, as the greatest blessing that can be granted to us[22]:\r\nand when he mentions cases of resuscitation, it is only to indulge in\r\nthe querulous complaint, that, “exposed as he is by his birth to the\r\ncaprices of fortune, man can be certain of nothing; no, not even his\r\nown death[23].” Though anything but[24] an Epicurean, in the modern\r\nacceptation of the word, he seems to have held some, at least, of\r\nthe tenets of Epicurus, in reference to the immortality of the soul.\r\nWhether he supposed that the soul, at the moment of death, is resolved\r\ninto its previous atoms or constituent elements, he does not inform us;\r\nbut he states it as his belief, that after death the soul has no more\r\nexistence than it had before birth; that all notions of immortality are\r\na mere delusion[25]; and that the very idea of a future existence is\r\nridiculous, and spoils that greatest[26] blessing of nature—death. He\r\ncertainly speaks of ghosts or apparitions, seen after death; but these\r\nhe probably looked upon as exceptional cases, if indeed he believed[27]\r\nin the stories which he quotes, of which we have no proofs, or rather,\r\nindeed, presumptive proofs to the contrary; for some of them he calls\r\n“magna[28] fabulosetas,” “most fabulous tales.”\r\n\r\nIn relation to human inventions, it is worthy of remark, that he\r\nstates that the first[29] thing in which mankind agreed, was the use of\r\nthe Ionian alphabet; the second, the practice of shaving[30] the beard,\r\nand the employment of barbers; and the third, the division of time into\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nWe cannot more appropriately conclude this review of the Life and Works\r\nof Pliny, than by quoting the opinions of two of the most eminent\r\nphilosophers of modern times, Buffon and Cuvier; though the former,\r\nit must be admitted, has spoken of him in somewhat too high terms of\r\ncommendation, and in instituting a comparison between Pliny’s work and\r\nthose of Aristotle, has placed in juxtaposition the names of two men\r\nwho, beyond an ardent thirst for knowledge, had no characteristics in\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n“Pliny,” says Buffon[31], “has worked upon a plan which is much more\r\nextensive than that of Aristotle, and not improbably too extensive.\r\nHe has made it his object to embrace every subject; indeed he would\r\nappear to have taken the measure of Nature, and to have found her\r\ntoo contracted for his expansive genius. His ‘Natural History,’\r\nindependently of that of animals, plants, and minerals, includes\r\nan account of the heavens and the earth, of medicine, commerce,\r\nnavigation, the liberal and mechanical arts, the origin of usages and\r\ncustoms, in a word, the history of all the natural sciences and all the\r\narts of human invention. What, too, is still more astonishing, in each\r\nof these departments Pliny shows himself equally great. The grandeur of\r\nhis ideas and the dignity of his style confer an additional lustre on\r\nthe profoundness of his erudition; not only did he know all that was\r\nknown in his time, but he was also gifted with that comprehensiveness\r\nof view which in some measure multiplies knowledge. He had all that\r\ndelicacy of perception upon which depend so materially both elegance\r\nand taste, and he communicates to his readers that freedom of thought\r\nand that boldness of sentiment, which constitute the true germ of\r\nphilosophy. His work, as varied as Nature herself, always paints her\r\nin her most attractive colours. It is, so to say, a compilation from\r\nall that had been written before his time: a record of all that was\r\nexcellent or useful; but this record has in it features so grand, this\r\ncompilation contains matter grouped in a manner so novel, that it\r\nis preferable to most of the original works that treat upon similar\r\nsubjects.”\r\n\r\nThe judgment pronounced by Cuvier on Pliny’s work, though somewhat\r\nless highly coloured, awards to it a high rank among the most valuable\r\nproductions of antiquity. “The work of Pliny[32],” says he, “is one\r\nof the most precious monuments that have come down to us from ancient\r\ntimes, and affords proof of an astonishing amount of erudition in one\r\nwho was a warrior and a statesman. To appreciate with justice this vast\r\nand celebrated composition, it is necessary to regard it in several\r\npoints of view—with reference to the plan proposed, the facts stated,\r\nand the style employed. The plan proposed by the writer is of immense\r\nextent—it is his object to write not merely a Natural History in our\r\nrestricted sense of the term, not an account merely, more or less\r\ndetailed, of animals, plants, and minerals, but a work which embraces\r\nastronomy, physics, geography, agriculture, commerce, medicine, and\r\nthe fine arts—and all these in addition to natural history properly\r\nso called; while at the same time he continually interweaves with\r\nhis narrative information upon the arts which bear relation to man\r\nconsidered metaphysically, and the history of nations,—so much so\r\nindeed, that in many respects this work was the Encyclopædia of its\r\nage. It was impossible in running over, however cursorily, such a\r\nprodigious number of subjects, that the writer should not have made\r\nus acquainted with a multitude of facts, which, while remarkable in\r\nthemselves, are the more precious from the circumstance that at the\r\npresent day he is the only author extant who relates them. It is to\r\nbe regretted however that the manner in which he has collected and\r\ngrouped this mass of matter, has caused it to lose some portion of its\r\nvalue, from his mixture of fable with truth, and more especially from\r\nthe difficulty, and in some cases, the impossibility, of discovering\r\nexactly of what object[33] he is speaking. But if Pliny possesses\r\nlittle merit as a critic, it is far otherwise with his talent as a\r\nwriter, and the immense treasury which he opens to us of Latin terms\r\nand forms of expression: these, from the very abundance of the subjects\r\nupon which he treats, render his work one of the richest repositories\r\nof the Roman language. Wherever he finds it possible to give expression\r\nto general ideas or to philosophical views, his language assumes\r\nconsiderable energy and vivacity, and his thoughts present to us a\r\ncertain novelty and boldness which tend in a very great degree to\r\nrelieve the dryness of his enumerations, and, with the majority of his\r\nreaders, excuse the insufficiency of his scientific indications. He\r\nis always noble and serious, full of the love of justice and virtue,\r\ndetestation of cruelty and baseness, of which he had such frightful\r\ninstances before his eyes, and contempt for that unbridled luxury which\r\nin his time had so deeply corrupted the Roman people. For these great\r\nmerits Pliny cannot be too highly praised, and despite the faults\r\nwhich we are obliged to admit in him when viewed as a naturalist, we\r\nare bound to regard him as one of the most meritorious of the Roman\r\nwriters, and among those most worthy to be reckoned in the number of\r\nthe classics who wrote after the reign of Augustus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nOF THE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK I.\r\n\r\n  DEDICATION.

PLINIUS SECUNDUS TO HIS FRIEND TITUS VESPASIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis treatise on Natural History, a novel work in Roman literature,\r\nwhich I have just completed, I have taken the liberty to dedicate to\r\nyou, most gracious[35] Emperor, an appellation peculiarly suitable to\r\nyou, while, on account of his age, that of _great_ is more appropriate\r\nto your Father;—\r\n\r\n  “For still thou ne’er wouldst quite despise\r\n    The trifles that I write[36];”\r\n\r\nif I may be allowed to shelter myself under the example of Catullus,\r\nmy fellow-countryman[37], a military term, which you well understand.\r\nFor he, as you know, when his napkins had been changed[38], expressed\r\nhimself a little harshly, from his anxiety to show his friendship\r\nfor his dear little _Veranius_ and _Fabius_[39]. At the same time\r\nthis my importunity may effect, what you complained of my not having\r\ndone in another too forward epistle of mine; it will put upon record,\r\nand let all the world know, with what kindness you exercise the\r\nimperial dignity. You, who have had the honour of a triumph, and of\r\nthe censorship, have been six times consul, and have shared in the\r\ntribunate; and, what is still more honourable, whilst you held them in\r\nconjunction with your Father, you have presided over the Equestrian\r\norder, and been the Prefect of the Prætorians[40]: all this you have\r\ndone for the service of the Republic, and, at the same time, have\r\nregarded me as a fellow-soldier and a messmate. Nor has the extent of\r\nyour prosperity produced any change in you, except that it has given\r\nyou the power of doing good to the utmost of your wishes. And whilst\r\nall these circumstances increase the veneration which other persons\r\nfeel for you, with respect to myself, they have made me so bold, as to\r\nwish to become more familiar. You must, therefore, place this to your\r\nown account, and blame yourself for any fault of this kind that I may\r\ncommit.\r\n\r\nBut, although I have laid aside my blushes[41], I have not gained\r\nmy object; for you still awe me, and keep me at a distance, by the\r\nmajesty of your understanding. In no one does the force of eloquence\r\nand of tribunitian oratory blaze out more powerfully! With what glowing\r\nlanguage do you thunder forth the praises of your Father! How dearly\r\ndo you love your Brother! How admirable is your talent for poetry!\r\nWhat a fertility of genius do you possess, so as to enable you to\r\nimitate your Brother[42]! But who is there that is bold enough to form\r\nan estimate on these points, if he is to be judged by you, and, more\r\nespecially, if you are challenged to do so? For the case of those\r\nwho merely publish their works is very different from that of those\r\nwho expressly dedicate them to you. In the former case I might say,\r\nEmperor! why do you read these things? They are written only for the\r\ncommon people, for farmers or mechanics, or for those who have nothing\r\nelse to do; why do you trouble yourself with them? Indeed, when I\r\nundertook this work, I did not expect that you would sit in judgement\r\nupon me[43]; I considered your situation much too elevated for you to\r\ndescend to such an office. Besides, we possess the right of openly\r\nrejecting the opinion of men of learning. M. Tullius himself, whose\r\ngenius is beyond all competition, uses this privilege; and, remarkable\r\nas it may appear, employs an advocate in his own defence:—“I do not\r\nwrite for very learned people; I do not wish my works to be read by\r\nManius Persius, but by Junius Congus[44].” And if Lucilius, who first\r\nintroduced the satirical style[45], applied such a remark to himself,\r\nand if Cicero thought proper to borrow it, and that more especially\r\nin his treatise “De Republica,” how much reason have I to do so, who\r\nhave such a judge to defend myself against! And by this dedication\r\nI have deprived myself of the benefit of challenge[46]; for it is a\r\nvery different thing whether a person has a judge given him by lot, or\r\nwhether he voluntarily selects one; and we always make more preparation\r\nfor an invited guest, than for one that comes in unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nWhen the candidates for office, during the heat of the canvass,\r\ndeposited the fine[47] in the hands of Cato, that determined opposer\r\nof bribery, rejoicing as he did in his being rejected from what he\r\nconsidered to be foolish honours, they professed to do this out of\r\nrespect to his integrity; the greatest glory which a man could attain.\r\nIt was on this occasion that Cicero uttered the noble ejaculation, “How\r\nhappy are you, Marcus Porcius, of whom no one dares to ask what is\r\ndishonourable[48]!” When L. Scipio Asiaticus appealed to the tribunes,\r\namong whom was Gracchus, he expressed full confidence that he should\r\nobtain an acquittal, even from a judge who was his enemy. Hence it\r\nfollows, that he who appoints his own judge must absolutely submit to\r\nthe decision; this choice is therefore termed an appeal[49].\r\n\r\nI am well aware, that, placed as you are in the highest station, and\r\ngifted with the most splendid eloquence and the most accomplished\r\nmind, even those who come to pay their respects to you, do it with a\r\nkind of veneration: on this account I ought to be careful that what\r\nis dedicated to you should be worthy of you. But the country people,\r\nand, indeed, some whole nations offer milk to the Gods[50], and those\r\nwho cannot procure frankincense substitute in its place salted cakes;\r\nfor the Gods are not dissatisfied when they are worshiped by every one\r\nto the best of his ability. But my temerity will appear the greater\r\nby the consideration, that these volumes, which I dedicate to you,\r\nare of such inferior importance. For they do not admit of the display\r\nof genius, nor, indeed, is mine one of the highest order; they admit\r\nof no excursions, nor orations, nor discussions, nor of any wonderful\r\nadventures, nor any variety of transactions, nor, from the barrenness\r\nof the matter, of anything particularly pleasant in the narration, or\r\nagreeable to the reader. The nature of things, and life as it actually\r\nexists, are described in them; and often the lowest department of it;\r\nso that, in very many cases, I am obliged to use rude and foreign, or\r\neven barbarous terms, and these often require to be introduced by a\r\nkind of preface. And, besides this, my road is not a beaten track, nor\r\none which the mind is much disposed to travel over. There is no one\r\namong us who has ever attempted it, nor is there any one individual\r\namong the Greeks who has treated of all the topics. Most of us seek\r\nfor nothing but amusement in our studies, while others are fond of\r\nsubjects that are of excessive subtilty, and completely involved in\r\nobscurity. My object is to treat of all those things which the Greeks\r\ninclude in the Encyclopædia[51], which, however, are either not\r\ngenerally known or are rendered dubious from our ingenious conceits.\r\nAnd there are other matters which many writers have given so much in\r\ndetail that we quite loathe them. It is, indeed, no easy task to give\r\nnovelty to what is old, and authority to what is new; brightness to\r\nwhat is become tarnished, and light to what is obscure; to render what\r\nis slighted acceptable, and what is doubtful worthy of our confidence;\r\nto give to all a natural manner, and to each its peculiar nature. It\r\nis sufficiently honourable and glorious to have been willing even to\r\nmake the attempt, although it should prove unsuccessful. And, indeed,\r\nI am of opinion, that the studies of those are more especially worthy\r\nof our regard, who, after having overcome all difficulties, prefer the\r\nuseful office of assisting others to the mere gratification of giving\r\npleasure; and this is what I have already done in some of my former\r\nworks. I confess it surprises me, that T. Livius, so celebrated an\r\nauthor as he is, in one of the books of his history of the city from\r\nits origin, should begin with this remark, “I have now obtained a\r\nsufficient reputation, so that I might put an end to my work, did not\r\nmy restless mind require to be supported by employment[52].” Certainly\r\nhe ought to have composed this work, not for his own glory, but for\r\nthat of the Roman name, and of the people who were the conquerors\r\nof all other nations. It would have been more meritorious to have\r\npersevered in his labours from his love of the work, than from the\r\ngratification which it afforded himself, and to have accomplished it,\r\nnot for his own sake, but for that of the Roman people.\r\n\r\nI have included in thirty-six[53] books 20,000 topics, all worthy\r\nof attention, (for, as Domitius Piso[54] says, we ought to make\r\nnot merely books, but valuable collections,) gained by the perusal\r\nof about 2000 volumes, of which a few only are in the hands of the\r\nstudious, on account of the obscurity of the subjects, procured by the\r\ncareful perusal of 100 select authors[55]; and to these I have made\r\nconsiderable additions of things, which were either not known to my\r\npredecessors, or which have been lately discovered. Nor can I doubt but\r\nthat there still remain many things which I have omitted; for I am a\r\nmere mortal, and one that has many occupations. I have, therefore, been\r\nobliged to compose this work at interrupted intervals, indeed during\r\nthe night, so that you will find that I have not been idle even during\r\nthis period. The day I devote to you, exactly portioning out my sleep\r\nto the necessity of my health, and contenting myself with this reward,\r\nthat while we are musing[56] on these subjects (according to the remark\r\nof Varro), we are adding to the length of our lives; for life properly\r\nconsists in being awake.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of these circumstances and these difficulties, I dare\r\npromise nothing; but you have done me the most essential service in\r\npermitting me to dedicate my work to you. Nor does this merely give\r\na sanction to it, but it determines its value; for things are often\r\nconceived to be of great value, solely because they are consecrated in\r\ntemples.\r\n\r\nI have given a full account of all your family—your Father, yourself,\r\nand your Brother, in a history of our own times, beginning where\r\nAufidius Bassus concludes[57]. You will ask, Where is it? It has been\r\nlong completed and its accuracy confirmed[58]; but I have determined to\r\ncommit the charge of it to my heirs, lest I should have been suspected,\r\nduring my lifetime, of having been unduly influenced by ambition. By\r\nthis means I confer an obligation on those who occupy the same ground\r\nwith myself; and also on posterity, who, I am aware, will contend with\r\nme, as I have done with my predecessors.\r\n\r\nYou may judge of my taste from my having inserted, in the beginning of\r\nmy book, the names of the authors that I have consulted. For I consider\r\nit to be courteous and to indicate an ingenuous modesty, to acknowledge\r\nthe sources whence we have derived assistance, and not to act as most\r\nof those have done whom I have examined. For I must inform you, that\r\nin comparing various authors with each other, I have discovered, that\r\nsome of the most grave and of the latest writers have transcribed,\r\nword for word, from former works, without making any acknowledgement;\r\nnot avowedly rivalling them, in the manner of Virgil, or with the\r\ncandour of Cicero, who, in his treatise “De Republica[59],” professes\r\nto coincide in opinion with Plato, and in his Essay on Consolation for\r\nhis Daughter, says that he follows Crantor, and, in his Offices[60],\r\nPanæcius; volumes, which, as you well know, ought not merely to be\r\nalways in our hands, but to be learned by heart. For it is indeed the\r\nmark of a perverted mind and a bad disposition, to prefer being caught\r\nin a theft to returning what we have borrowed, especially when we have\r\nacquired capital, by usurious interest[61].\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were wonderfully happy in their titles. One work they called\r\nΚηρίον, which means that it was as sweet as a honeycomb; another Κέρας\r\nἈμαλθείας, or Cornu copiæ, so that you might expect to get even a\r\ndraught of pigeon’s milk from it[62]. Then they have their Flowers,\r\ntheir Muses, Magazines, Manuals, Gardens, Pictures, and Sketches[63],\r\nall of them titles for which a man might be tempted even to forfeit his\r\nbail. But when you enter upon the works, O ye Gods and Goddesses! how\r\nfull of emptiness! Our duller countrymen have merely their Antiquities,\r\nor their Examples, or their Arts. I think one of the most humorous of\r\nthem has his Nocturnal Studies[64], a term employed by Bibaculus; a\r\nname which he richly deserved[65]. Varro, indeed, is not much behind\r\nhim, when he calls one of his satires A Trick and a Half, and another\r\nTurning the Tables[66]. Diodorus was the first among the Greeks who\r\nlaid aside this trifling manner and named his history The Library[67].\r\nApion, the grammarian, indeed—he whom Tiberius Cæsar called the\r\nTrumpeter of the World, but would rather seem to be the Bell of the\r\nTown-crier[68],—supposed that every one to whom he inscribed any work\r\nwould thence acquire immortality. I do not regret not having given my\r\nwork a more fanciful title.\r\n\r\nThat I may not, however, appear to inveigh so completely against the\r\nGreeks, I should wish to be considered under the same point of view\r\nwith those inventors of the arts of painting and sculpture, of whom\r\nyou will find an account in these volumes, whose works, although they\r\nare so perfect that we are never satisfied with admiring them, are\r\ninscribed with a temporary title[69], such as “Apelles, or Polycletus,\r\nwas doing this;” implying that the work was only commenced and still\r\nimperfect, and that the artist might benefit by the criticisms that\r\nwere made on it and alter any part that required it, if he had not been\r\nprevented by death. It is also a great mark of their modesty, that they\r\ninscribed their works as if they were the last which they had executed,\r\nand as still in hand at the time of their death. I think there are but\r\nthree works of art which are inscribed positively with the words “such\r\na one executed this;” of these I shall give an account in the proper\r\nplace. In these cases it appears, that the artist felt the most perfect\r\nsatisfaction with his work, and hence these pieces have excited the\r\nenvy of every one.\r\n\r\nI, indeed, freely admit, that much may be added to my works; not only\r\nto this, but to all which I have published. By this admission I hope to\r\nescape from the carping critics[70], and I have the more reason to say\r\nthis, because I hear that there are certain Stoics and Logicians[71],\r\nand also Epicureans (from the Grammarians[72] I expected as much),\r\nwho are big with something against the little work I published on\r\nGrammar[73]; and that they have been carrying these abortions for ten\r\nyears together—a longer pregnancy this than the elephant’s[74]. But I\r\nwell know, that even a woman once wrote against Theophrastus, a man so\r\neminent for his eloquence that he obtained his name, which signifies\r\nthe Divine speaker[75], and that from this circumstance originated the\r\nproverb of choosing a tree to hang oneself[76].\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from quoting the words of Cato the censor, which are\r\nso pertinent to this point. It appears from them, that even Cato, who\r\nwrote commentaries on military discipline[77], and who had learned the\r\nmilitary art under Africanus, or rather under Hannibal (for he could\r\nnot endure Africanus[78], who, when he was his general, had borne away\r\nthe triumph from him), that Cato, I say, was open to the attacks of\r\nsuch as caught at reputation for themselves by detracting from the\r\nmerits of others. And what does he say in his book? “I know, that when\r\nI shall publish what I have written, there will be many who will do\r\nall they can to depreciate it, and, especially, such as are themselves\r\nvoid of all merit; but I let their harangues glide by me.” Nor was the\r\nremark of Plancus[79] a bad one, when Asinius Pollio[80] was said to\r\nbe preparing an oration against him, which was to be published either\r\nby himself or his children, after the death of Plancus, in order that\r\nhe might not be able to answer it: “It is only ghosts that fight with\r\nthe dead.” This gave such a blow to the oration, that in the opinion\r\nof the learned generally, nothing was ever thought more scandalous.\r\nFeeling myself, therefore, secure against these vile slanderers[81], a\r\nname elegantly composed by Cato, to express their slanderous and vile\r\ndisposition (for what other object have they, but to wrangle and breed\r\nquarrels?), I will proceed with my projected work.\r\n\r\nAnd because the public good requires that you should be spared as much\r\nas possible from all trouble, I have subjoined to this epistle the\r\ncontents of each of the following books[82], and have used my best\r\nendeavours to prevent your being obliged to read them all through. And\r\nthis, which was done for your benefit, will also serve the same purpose\r\nfor others, so that any one may search for what he wishes, and may\r\nknow where to find it. This has been already done among us by Valerius\r\nSoranus, in his work which he entitled “On Mysteries[83].”\r\n\r\n  The 1st book is the Preface of the Work, dedicated to Titus Vespasian\r\n  Cæsar.\r\n\r\n  The 2nd is on the World, the Elements, and the Heavenly Bodies[84].\r\n\r\n  The 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th books are on Geography, in which is\r\n  contained an account of the situation of the different countries,\r\n  the inhabitants, the seas, towns, harbours, mountains, rivers, and\r\n  dimensions, and the various tribes, some of which still exist and\r\n  others have disappeared.\r\n\r\n  The 7th is on Man, and the Inventions of Man.\r\n\r\n  The 8th on the various kinds of Land Animals.\r\n\r\n  The 9th on Aquatic Animals.\r\n\r\n  The 10th on the various kinds of Birds.\r\n\r\n  The 11th on Insects.\r\n\r\n  The 12th on Odoriferous Plants.\r\n\r\n  The 13th on Exotic Trees.\r\n\r\n  The 14th on Vines.\r\n\r\n  The 15th on Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\n  The 16th on Forest Trees.\r\n\r\n  The 17th on Plants raised in nurseries or gardens.\r\n\r\n  The 18th on the nature of Fruits and the Cerealia, and the pursuits\r\n  of the Husbandman.\r\n\r\n  The 19th on Flax, Broom[85], and Gardening.\r\n\r\n  The 20th on the Cultivated Plants that are proper for food and for\r\n  medicine.\r\n\r\n  The 21st on Flowers and Plants that are used for making Garlands.\r\n\r\n  The 22nd on Garlands, and Medicines made from Plants.\r\n\r\n  The 23rd on Medicines made from Wine and from cultivated Trees.\r\n\r\n  The 24th on Medicines made from Forest Trees.\r\n\r\n  The 25th on Medicines made from Wild Plants.\r\n\r\n  The 26th on New Diseases, and Medicines made, for certain Diseases,\r\n  from Plants.\r\n\r\n  The 27th on some other Plants and Medicines.\r\n\r\n  The 28th on Medicines procured from Man and from large Animals.\r\n\r\n  The 29th on Medical Authors, and on Medicines from other Animals.\r\n\r\n  The 30th on Magic, and Medicines for certain parts of the Body.\r\n\r\n  The 31st on Medicines from Aquatic Animals.\r\n\r\n  The 32nd on the other properties of Aquatic Animals.\r\n\r\n  The 33rd on Gold and Silver.\r\n\r\n  The 34th on Copper and Lead, and the workers of Copper.\r\n\r\n  The 35th on Painting, Colours, and Painters.\r\n\r\n  The 36th on Marbles and Stones.\r\n\r\n  The 37th on Gems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE WORLD AND THE ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n[I have adopted the division of the chapters from Hardouin, as given\r\nin the editions of Valpy, Lemaire, Ajasson, and Sillig; the Roman\r\nfigures, enclosed between brackets, are the numbers of the chapters\r\nin Dalechamps, De Laët, Gronovius, Holland, and Poinsinet. The titles\r\nof the chapters are nearly the same with those in Valpy, Lemaire, and\r\nAjasson.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 1. (1.)—WHETHER THE WORLD BE FINITE, AND WHETHER THERE BE MORE\r\nTHAN ONE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world[86], and whatever that be which we otherwise call the\r\nheavens[87], by the vault of which all things are enclosed, we must\r\nconceive to be a Deity[88], to be eternal, without bounds, neither\r\ncreated, nor subject, at any time, to destruction[89]. To inquire what\r\nis beyond it is no concern of man, nor can the human mind form any\r\nconjecture respecting it. It is sacred, eternal, and without bounds,\r\nall in all; indeed including everything in itself; finite, yet like\r\nwhat is infinite; the most certain of all things, yet like what is\r\nuncertain, externally and internally embracing all things in itself; it\r\nis the work of nature, and itself constitutes nature[90].\r\n\r\nIt is madness to harass the mind, as some have done, with attempts to\r\nmeasure the world, and to publish these attempts; or, like others, to\r\nargue from what they have made out, that there are innumerable other\r\nworlds, and that we must believe there to be so many other natures,\r\nor that, if only one nature produced the whole, there will be so many\r\nsuns and so many moons, and that each of them will have immense trains\r\nof other heavenly bodies. As if the same question would not recur at\r\nevery step of our inquiry, anxious as we must be to arrive at some\r\ntermination; or, as if this infinity, which we ascribe to nature,\r\nthe former of all things, cannot be more easily comprehended by one\r\nsingle formation, especially when that is so extensive. It is madness,\r\nperfect madness, to go out of this world and to search for what is\r\nbeyond it, as if one who is ignorant of his own dimensions could\r\nascertain the measure of any thing else, or as if the human mind could\r\nsee what the world itself cannot contain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2. (2.)—OF THE FORM OF THE WORLD[91].\r\n\r\n\r\nThat it has the form of a perfect globe we learn from the name which\r\nhas been uniformly given to it, as well as from numerous natural\r\narguments. For not only does a figure of this kind return everywhere\r\ninto itself[92] and sustain itself, also including itself, requiring\r\nno adjustments, not sensible of either end or beginning in any of its\r\nparts, and is best fitted for that motion, with which, as will appear\r\nhereafter, it is continually turning round; but still more, because we\r\nperceive it, by the evidence of the sight, to be, in every part, convex\r\nand central, which could not be the case were it of any other figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3. (3.)—OF ITS NATURE; WHENCE THE NAME IS DERIVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rising and the setting of the sun clearly prove, that this globe\r\nis carried round in the space of twenty-four hours, in an eternal and\r\nnever-ceasing circuit, and with incredible swiftness[93]. I am not\r\nable to say, whether the sound caused by the whirling about of so great\r\na mass be excessive, and, therefore, far beyond what our ears can\r\nperceive, nor, indeed, whether the resounding of so many stars, all\r\ncarried along at the same time and revolving in their orbits, may not\r\nproduce a kind of delightful harmony of incredible sweetness[94]. To\r\nus, who are in the interior, the world appears to glide silently along,\r\nboth by day and by night.\r\n\r\nVarious circumstances in nature prove to us, that there are impressed\r\non the heavens innumerable figures of animals and of all kinds of\r\nobjects, and that its surface is not perfectly polished like the eggs\r\nof birds, as some celebrated authors assert[95]. For we find that the\r\nseeds of all bodies fall down from it, principally into the ocean,\r\nand, being mixed together, that a variety of monstrous forms are in\r\nthis way frequently produced. And, indeed, this is evident to the eye;\r\nfor, in one part, we have the figure of a wain, in another of a bear,\r\nof a bull, and of a letter[96]; while, in the middle of them, over our\r\nheads, there is a white circle[97].\r\n\r\n(4.) With respect to the name, I am influenced by the unanimous\r\nopinions of all nations. For what the Greeks, from its being\r\nornamented, have termed κόσμος, we, from its perfect and complete\r\nelegance, have termed _mundus_. The name _cœlum_, no doubt, refers to\r\nits being engraven, as it were, with the stars, as Varro suggests[98].\r\nIn confirmation of this idea we may adduce the Zodiac[99], in which\r\nare twelve figures of animals; through them it is that the sun has\r\ncontinued its course for so many ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4. (5.)—OF THE ELEMENTS[100] AND THE PLANETS[101].\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not find that any one has doubted that there are four elements.\r\nThe highest of these is supposed to be fire, and hence proceed the\r\neyes of so many glittering stars. The next is that spirit, which both\r\nthe Greeks and ourselves call by the same name, air[102]. It is by\r\nthe force of this vital principle, pervading all things and mingling\r\nwith all, that the earth, together with the fourth element, water, is\r\nbalanced in the middle of space. These are mutually bound together,\r\nthe lighter being restrained by the heavier, so that they cannot fly\r\noff; while, on the contrary, from the lighter tending upwards, the\r\nheavier are so suspended, that they cannot fall down. Thus, by an\r\nequal tendency in an opposite direction, each of them remains in its\r\nappropriate place, bound together by the never-ceasing revolution\r\nof the world, which always turning on itself, the earth falls to\r\nthe lowest part and is in the middle of the whole, while it remains\r\nsuspended in the centre[103], and, as it were, balancing this centre,\r\nin which it is suspended. So that it alone remains immoveable, whilst\r\nall things revolve round it, being connected with every other part,\r\nwhilst they all rest upon it.\r\n\r\n(6.) Between this body and the heavens there are suspended, in this\r\naërial spirit, seven stars[104], separated by determinate spaces,\r\nwhich, on account of their motion, we call wandering, although,\r\nin reality, none are less so[105]. The sun is carried along in the\r\nmidst of these, a body of great size and power, the ruler, not only\r\nof the seasons and of the different climates, but also of the stars\r\nthemselves and of the heavens[106]. When we consider his operations, we\r\nmust regard him as the life, or rather the mind of the universe, the\r\nchief regulator and the God of nature; he also lends his light to the\r\nother stars[107]. He is most illustrious and excellent, beholding all\r\nthings and hearing all things, which, I perceive, is ascribed to him\r\nexclusively by the prince of poets, Homer[108].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (7.)—OF GOD[109].\r\n\r\n\r\nI consider it, therefore, an indication of human weakness to inquire\r\ninto the figure and form of God. For whatever God be, if there be any\r\nother God[110], and wherever he exists, he is all sense, all sight,\r\nall hearing, all life, all mind[111], and all within himself. To\r\nbelieve that there are a number of Gods, derived from the virtues and\r\nvices of man[112], as Chastity, Concord, Understanding, Hope, Honour,\r\nClemency, and Fidelity; or, according to the opinion of Democritus,\r\nthat there are only two, Punishment and Reward[113], indicates still\r\ngreater folly. Human nature, weak and frail as it is, mindful of its\r\nown infirmity, has made these divisions, so that every one might have\r\nrecourse to that which he supposed himself to stand more particularly\r\nin need of[114]. Hence we find different names employed by different\r\nnations; the inferior deities are arranged in classes, and diseases and\r\nplagues are deified, in consequence of our anxious wish to propitiate\r\nthem. It was from this cause that a temple was dedicated to Fever, at\r\nthe public expense, on the Palatine Hill[115], and to Orbona[116], near\r\nthe Temple of the Lares, and that an altar was elected to Good Fortune\r\non the Esquiline. Hence we may understand how it comes to pass that\r\nthere is a greater population of the Celestials than of human beings,\r\nsince each individual makes a separate God for himself, adopting his\r\nown Juno and his own Genius[117]. And there are nations who make Gods\r\nof certain animals, and even certain obscene things[118], which are not\r\nto be spoken of, swearing by stinking meats and such like. To suppose\r\nthat marriages are contracted between the Gods, and that, during so\r\nlong a period, there should have been no issue from them, that some\r\nof them should be old and always grey-headed and others young and like\r\nchildren, some of a dark, complexion, winged, lame, produced from\r\neggs, living and dying on alternate days, is sufficiently puerile and\r\nfoolish. But it is the height of impudence to imagine, that adultery\r\ntakes place between them, that they have contests and quarrels, and\r\nthat there are Gods of theft and of various crimes[119]. To assist man\r\nis to be a God; this is the path to eternal glory. This is the path\r\nwhich the Roman nobles formerly pursued, and this is the path which is\r\nnow pursued by the greatest ruler of our age, Vespasian Augustus, he\r\nwho has come to the relief of an exhausted empire, as well as by his\r\nsons. This was the ancient mode of remunerating those who deserved it,\r\nto regard them as Gods[120]. For the names of all the Gods, as well as\r\nof the stars that I have mentioned above[121], have been derived from\r\ntheir services to mankind. And with respect to Jupiter and Mercury, and\r\nthe rest of the celestial nomenclature, who does not admit that they\r\nhave reference to certain natural phenomena[122]?\r\n\r\nBut it is ridiculous to suppose, that the great head of all things,\r\nwhatever it be, pays any regard to human affairs[123]. Can we believe,\r\nor rather can there be any doubt, that it is not polluted by such a\r\ndisagreeable and complicated office? It is not easy to determine which\r\nopinion would be most for the advantage of mankind, since we observe\r\nsome who have no respect for the Gods, and others who carry it to a\r\nscandalous excess. They are slaves to foreign ceremonies; they carry on\r\ntheir fingers the Gods and the monsters whom they worship[124]; they\r\ncondemn and they lay great stress on certain kinds of food; they impose\r\non themselves dreadful ordinances, not even sleeping quietly. They do\r\nnot marry or adopt children, or indeed do anything else, without the\r\nsanction of their sacred rites. There are others, on the contrary, who\r\nwill cheat in the very Capitol, and will forswear themselves even by\r\nJupiter Tonans[125], and while these thrive in their crimes, the others\r\ntorment themselves with their superstitions to no purpose.\r\n\r\nAmong these discordant opinions mankind have discovered for themselves\r\na kind of intermediate deity, by which our scepticism concerning God\r\nis still increased. For all over the world, in all places, and at\r\nall times, Fortune is the only god whom every one invokes; she alone\r\nis spoken of, she alone is accused and is supposed to be guilty; she\r\nalone is in our thoughts, is praised and blamed, and is loaded with\r\nreproaches; wavering as she is, conceived by the generality of mankind\r\nto be blind, wandering, inconstant, uncertain, variable, and often\r\nfavouring the unworthy. To her are referred all our losses and all our\r\ngains, and in casting up the accounts of mortals she alone balances the\r\ntwo pages of our sheet[126]. We are so much in the power of chance,\r\nthat chance itself is considered as a God, and the existence of God\r\nbecomes doubtful.\r\n\r\nBut there are others who reject this principle and assign events to\r\nthe influence of the stars[127], and to the laws of our nativity;\r\nthey suppose that God, once for all, issues his decrees and never\r\nafterwards interferes. This opinion begins to gain ground, and both the\r\nlearned and the unlearned vulgar are falling into it. Hence we have\r\nthe admonitions of thunder, the warnings of oracles, the predictions\r\nof soothsayers, and things too trifling to be mentioned, as sneezing\r\nand stumbling with the feet reckoned among omens[128]. The late Emperor\r\nAugustus[129] relates, that he put the left shoe on the wrong foot,\r\nthe day when he was near being assaulted by his soldiers[130]. And\r\nsuch things as these so embarrass improvident mortals, that among all\r\nof them this alone is certain, that there is nothing certain, and\r\nthat there is nothing more proud or more wretched than man. For other\r\nanimals have no care but to provide for their subsistence, for which\r\nthe spontaneous kindness of nature is all-sufficient; and this one\r\ncircumstance renders their lot more especially preferable, that they\r\nnever think about glory, or money, or ambition, and, above all, that\r\nthey never reflect on death.\r\n\r\nThe belief, however, that on these points the Gods superintend human\r\naffairs is useful to us, as well as that the punishment of crimes,\r\nalthough sometimes tardy, from the Deity being occupied with such a\r\nmass of business, is never entirely remitted, and that the human race\r\nwas not made the next in rank to himself, in order that they might be\r\ndegraded like brutes. And indeed this constitutes the great comfort in\r\nthis imperfect state of man, that even the Deity cannot do everything.\r\nFor he cannot procure death for himself, even if he wished it, which,\r\nso numerous are the evils of life, has been granted to man as our\r\nchief good. Nor can he make mortals immortal, or recall to life those\r\nwho are dead; nor can he effect, that he who has once lived shall not\r\nhave lived, or that he who has enjoyed honours shall not have enjoyed\r\nthem; nor has he any influence over past events but to cause them to be\r\nforgotten. And, if we illustrate the nature of our connexion with God\r\nby a less serious argument, he cannot make twice ten not to be twenty,\r\nand many other things of this kind. By these considerations the power\r\nof Nature is clearly proved, and is shown to be what we call God. It\r\nis not foreign to the subject to have digressed into these matters,\r\nfamiliar as they are to every one, from the continual discussions that\r\ntake place respecting God[131].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6. (8.)—OF THE NATURE OF THE STARS; OF THE MOTION OF THE PLANETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us return from this digression to the other parts of nature. The\r\nstars which are described as fixed in the heavens[132], are not, as the\r\nvulgar suppose, attached each of them to different individuals[133],\r\nthe brighter to the rich, those that are less so to the poor, and\r\nthe dim to the aged, shining according to the lot of the individual,\r\nand separately assigned to mortals; for they have neither come into\r\nexistence, nor do they perish in connexion with particular persons,\r\nnor does a falling star indicate that any one is dead. We are not so\r\nclosely connected with the heavens as that the shining of the stars\r\nis affected by our death[134]. When they are supposed to shoot or\r\nfall[135], they throw out, by the force of their fire, as if from an\r\nexcess of nutriment, the superabundance of the humour which they have\r\nabsorbed, as we observe to take place from the oil in our lamps, when\r\nthey are burning[136]. The nature of the celestial bodies is eternal,\r\nbeing interwoven, as it were, with the world, and, by this union,\r\nrendering it solid; but they exert their most powerful influence on\r\nthe earth. This, notwithstanding its subtilty, may be known by the\r\nclearness and the magnitude of the effect, as we shall point out in the\r\nproper place[137]. The account of the circles of the heavens will be\r\nbetter understood when we come to speak of the earth, since they have\r\nall a reference to it; except what has been discovered respecting the\r\nZodiac, which I shall now detail.\r\n\r\nAnaximander the Milesian, in the 58th olympiad[138], is said to have\r\nbeen the first who understood its obliquity, and thus opened the road\r\nto a correct knowledge of the subject[139]. Afterwards Cleostratus\r\nmade the signs in it, first marking those of Aries and Sagittarius;\r\nAtlas had formed the sphere long before this time[140]. But now,\r\nleaving the further consideration of this subject, we must treat of the\r\nbodies that are situated between the earth and the heavens[141].\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the star called Saturn is the highest, and\r\ntherefore appears the smallest, that he passes through the largest\r\ncircuit, and that he is at least thirty years in completing it[142].\r\nThe course of all the planets, and among others of the Sun, and the\r\nMoon, is in the contrary direction to that of the heavens[143], that\r\nis towards the left, while the heavens are rapidly carried about to\r\nthe right[144]. And although, by the stars constantly revolving with\r\nimmense velocity, they are raised up, and hurried on to the part where\r\nthey set, yet they are all forced, by a motion of their own, in an\r\nopposite direction[145]; and this is so ordered, lest the air, being\r\nalways moved in the same direction, by the constant whirling of the\r\nheavens, should accumulate into one mass, whereas now it is divided and\r\nseparated and beaten into small pieces, by the opposite motion of the\r\ndifferent stars. Saturn is a star of a cold and rigid nature, while\r\nthe orbit of Jupiter is much lower, and is carried round in twelve\r\nyears[146]. The next star, Mars, which some persons call Hercules[147],\r\nis of a fiery and burning nature, and from its nearness to the sun is\r\ncarried round in little less than two years[148]. In consequence of the\r\nexcessive heat of this star and the rigidity of Saturn, Jupiter, which\r\nis interposed between the two, is tempered by both of them, and is thus\r\nrendered salutary. The path of the Sun consists of 360 degrees; but, in\r\norder that the shadow may return to the same point of the dial[149],\r\nwe are obliged to add, in each year, five days and the fourth part\r\nof a day. On this account an intercalary day is given to every fifth\r\nyear[150], that the period of the seasons may agree with that of the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nBelow the Sun[151] revolves the great star called Venus, wandering\r\nwith an alternate motion[152], and, even in its surnames, rivalling\r\nthe Sun and the Moon. For when it precedes the day and rises in the\r\nmorning, it receives the name of Lucifer, as if it were another sun,\r\nhastening on the day. On the contrary, when it shines in the west, it\r\nis named Vesper, as prolonging the light, and performing the office\r\nof the moon. Pythagoras, the Samian, was the first who discovered\r\nits nature[153], about the 62nd olympiad, in the 222nd year of the\r\nCity[154]. It excels all the other stars in size, and its brilliancy\r\nis so considerable, that it is the only star which produces a shadow\r\nby its rays. There has, consequently, been great interest made for its\r\nname; some have called it the star of Juno[155], others of Isis, and\r\nothers of the Mother of the Gods. By its influence everything in the\r\nearth is generated. For, as it rises in either direction, it sprinkles\r\neverything with its genial dew, and not only matures the productions\r\nof the earth, but stimulates all living things[156]. It completes the\r\ncircuit of the zodiac in 348 days, never receding from the sun more\r\nthan 46 degrees, according to Timæus[157].\r\n\r\nSimilarly circumstanced, but by no means equal in size and in power,\r\nnext to it, is the star Mercury, by some called Apollo[158]; it is\r\ncarried in a lower orbit, and moves in a course which is quicker by\r\nnine days, shining sometimes before the rising of the sun, and at\r\nother times after its setting, but never going farther from it than 23\r\ndegrees[159], as we learn from Timæus and Sosigenes[160]. The nature of\r\nthese two stars is peculiar, and is not the same with those mentioned\r\nabove, for those are seen to recede from the sun through one-third or\r\none-fourth part of the heavens, and are often seen opposite to it. They\r\nhave also other larger circuits, in which they make their complete\r\nrevolutions, as will be described in the account of the great year[161].\r\n\r\n(9.) But the Moon[162], which is the last of the stars, and the one\r\nthe most connected with the earth, the remedy provided by nature for\r\ndarkness, excels all the others in its admirable qualities. By the\r\nvariety of appearances which it assumes, it puzzles the observers,\r\nmortified that they should be the most ignorant concerning that star\r\nwhich is the nearest to them. She is always either waxing or waning;\r\nsometimes her disc is curved into horns, sometimes it is divided\r\ninto two equal portions, and at other times it is swelled out into\r\na full orb; sometimes she appears spotted[163] and suddenly becomes\r\nvery bright; she appears very large with her full orb and suddenly\r\nbecomes invisible; now continuing during all the night, now rising\r\nlate, and now aiding the light of the sun during a part of the day;\r\nbecoming eclipsed and yet being visible while she is eclipsed;\r\nconcealing herself at the end of the month and yet not supposed to\r\nbe eclipsed[164]. Sometimes she is low down, sometimes she is high\r\nup, and that not according to one uniform course, being at one time\r\nraised up to the heavens, at other times almost contiguous to the\r\nmountains; now elevated in the north, now depressed in the south; all\r\nwhich circumstances having been noticed by Endymion, a report was\r\nspread about, that he was in love with the moon[165]. We are not indeed\r\nsufficiently grateful to those, who, with so much labour and care,\r\nhave enlightened us with this light[166]; while, so diseased is the\r\nhuman mind, that we take pleasure in writing the annals of blood and\r\nslaughter, in order that the crimes of men may be made known to those\r\nwho are ignorant of the constitution of the world itself.\r\n\r\nBeing nearest to the axis[167], and therefore having the smallest\r\norbit, the Moon passes in twenty-seven days and the one-third part of a\r\nday[168], through the same space for which Saturn, the highest of the\r\nplanets, as was stated above, requires thirty years. After remaining\r\nfor two days in conjunction with the sun, on the thirtieth day she\r\nagain very slowly emerges to pursue her accustomed course[169]. I\r\nknow not whether she ought not to be considered as our instructress\r\nin everything that can be known respecting the heavens; as that the\r\nyear is divided into the twelve divisions of the months, since she\r\nfollows the sun for the same number of times, until he returns to the\r\ncommencement of his course; and that her brightness, as well as that\r\nof the other stars, is regulated by that of the sun, if indeed they\r\nall of them shine by light borrowed from him, such as we see floating\r\nabout, when it is reflected from the surface of water. On this account\r\nit is that she dissolves so much moisture, by a gentle and less\r\nperfect force, and adds to the quantity of that which the rays of the\r\nsun consume[170]. On this account she appears with an unequal light,\r\nbecause being full only when she is in opposition, on all the remaining\r\ndays she shows only so much of herself to the earth as she receives\r\nlight from the sun[171]. She is not seen in conjunction, because, at\r\nthat time, she sends back the whole stream of light to the source\r\nwhence she has derived it. That the stars generally are nourished by\r\nthe terrestrial moisture is evident, because, when the moon is only\r\nhalf visible she is sometimes seen spotted, her power of absorbing\r\nmoisture not having been powerful enough; for the spots are nothing\r\nelse than the dregs of the earth drawn up along with the moisture[172].\r\n(10.) But her eclipses and those of the sun, the most wonderful of\r\nall the phenomena of nature, and which are like prodigies, serve to\r\nindicate the magnitude of these bodies and the shadow[173] which they\r\ncast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7.—OF THE ECLIPSES OF THE MOON AND THE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor it is evident that the sun is hid by the intervention[174] of the\r\nmoon, and the moon by the opposition[174] of the earth, and that these\r\nchanges are mutual, the moon, by her interposition[174], taking the\r\nrays of the sun from the earth, and the earth from the moon. As she\r\nadvances darkness is suddenly produced, and again the sun is obscured\r\nby her shade; for night is nothing more than the shade of the earth.\r\nThe figure of this shade is like that of a pyramid or an inverted\r\ntop[175]; and the moon enters it only near its point, and it does\r\nnot exceed the height of the moon, for there is no other star which\r\nis obscured in the same manner, while a figure of this kind always\r\nterminates in a point. The flight of birds, when very lofty, shows that\r\nshadows do not extend beyond a certain distance; their limit appears to\r\nbe the termination of the air and the commencement of the æther. Above\r\nthe moon everything is pure and full of an eternal light. The stars are\r\nvisible to us in the night, in the same way that other luminous bodies\r\nare seen in the dark. It is from these causes that the moon is eclipsed\r\nduring the night[176]. The two kinds of eclipses are not, however, at\r\nthe stated monthly periods, on account of the obliquity of the zodiac,\r\nand the irregularly wandering course of the moon, as stated above;\r\nbesides that the motions of these stars do not always occur exactly at\r\nthe same points[177].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8. (11.)—OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis kind of reasoning carries the human mind to the heavens, and by\r\ncontemplating the world as it were from thence, it discloses to us the\r\nmagnitude of the three greatest bodies in nature[178]. For the sun\r\ncould not be entirely concealed from the earth, by the intervention of\r\nthe moon, if the earth were greater than the moon[179]. And the vast\r\nsize of the third body, the sun, is manifest from that of the other\r\ntwo, so that it is not necessary to scrutinize its size, by arguing\r\nfrom its visible appearance, or from any conjectures of the mind; it\r\nmust be immense, because the shadows of rows of trees, extending for\r\nany number of miles, are disposed in right lines[180], as if the sun\r\nwere in the middle of space. Also, because, at the equinox, he is\r\nvertical to all the inhabitants of the southern districts at the same\r\ntime[181]; also, because the shadows of all the people who live on this\r\nside of the tropic fall, at noon, towards the north, and, at sunrise,\r\npoint to the west. But this could not be the case unless the sun were\r\nmuch greater than the earth; nor, unless it much exceeded Mount Ida in\r\nbreadth, could he be seen when he rises, passing considerably beyond\r\nit to the right and to the left, especially, considering that it is\r\nseparated by so great an interval[182].\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of the moon affords an undoubted argument of the sun’s\r\nmagnitude, as it also does of the small size of the earth[183]. For\r\nthere are shadows of three figures, and it is evident, that if the body\r\nwhich produces the shadow be equal to the light, then it will be thrown\r\noff in the form of a pillar, and have no termination. If the body be\r\ngreater than the light, the shadow will be in the form of an inverted\r\ncone[184] the bottom being the narrowest part, and being, at the same\r\ntime, of an infinite length. If the body be less than the light, then\r\nwe shall have the figure of a pyramid[185], terminating in a point. Now\r\nof this last kind is the shadow which produces the eclipse of the moon,\r\nand this is so manifest that there can be no doubt remaining, that the\r\nearth is exceeded in magnitude by the sun, a circumstance which is\r\nindeed indicated by the silent declaration of nature herself. For why\r\ndoes he recede from us at the winter half of the year[186]? That by\r\nthe darkness of the nights the earth may be refreshed, which otherwise\r\nwould be burned up, as indeed it is in certain parts; so great is his\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9. (12.)—AN ACCOUNT OF THE OBSERVATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ON\r\nTHE HEAVENS BY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first among the Romans, who explained to the people at large the\r\ncause of the two kinds of eclipses, was Sulpicius Gallus, who was\r\nconsul along with Marcellus; and when he was only a military tribune\r\nhe relieved the army from great anxiety the day before king Perseus\r\nwas conquered by Paulus[187]; for he was brought by the general into\r\na public assembly, in order to predict the eclipse, of which he\r\nafterwards gave an account in a separate treatise. Among the Greeks,\r\nThales the Milesian first investigated the subject, in the fourth\r\nyear of the forty-eighth olympiad, predicting the eclipse of the sun\r\nwhich took place in the reign of Alyattes, in the 170th year of the\r\nCity[188]. After them Hipparchus calculated the course of both these\r\nstars for the term of 600 years[189], including the months, days, and\r\nhours, the situation of the different places and the aspects adapted\r\nto each of them; all this has been confirmed by experience, and could\r\nonly be acquired by partaking, as it were, in the councils of nature.\r\nThese were indeed great men, superior to ordinary mortals, who having\r\ndiscovered the laws of these divine bodies, relieved the miserable\r\nmind of man from the fear which he had of eclipses, as foretelling\r\nsome dreadful events or the destruction of the stars. This alarm is\r\nfreely acknowledged in the sublime strains of Stesichorus and Pindar,\r\nas being produced by an eclipse of the sun[190]. And with respect to\r\nthe eclipse of the moon, mortals impute it to witchcraft, and therefore\r\nendeavour to aid her by producing discordant sounds. In consequence of\r\nthis kind of terror it was that Nicias, the general of the Athenians,\r\nbeing ignorant of the cause, was afraid to lead out the fleet, and\r\nbrought great distress on his troops[191]. Hail to your genius, ye\r\ninterpreters of heaven! ye who comprehend the nature of things, and who\r\nhave discovered a mode of reasoning by which ye have conquered both\r\ngods and men[192]! For who is there, in observing these things and\r\nseeing the labours[193] which the stars are compelled to undergo (since\r\nwe have chosen to apply this term to them), that would not cheerfully\r\nsubmit to his fate, as one born to die? I shall now, in a brief and\r\nsummary manner, touch on those points in which we are agreed, giving\r\nthe reasons where it is necessary to do so; for this is not a work of\r\nprofound argument, nor is it less wonderful to be able to suggest a\r\nprobable cause for everything, than to give a complete account of a few\r\nof them only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10. (13.)—ON THE RECURRENCE OF THE ECLIPSES OF THE SUN AND THE\r\nMOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained that the eclipses complete their whole revolution\r\nin the space of 223 months[194], that the eclipse of the sun takes\r\nplace only at the conclusion or the commencement of a lunation, which\r\nis termed conjunction[195], while an eclipse of the moon takes place\r\nonly when she is at the full, and is always a little farther advanced\r\nthan the preceding eclipse[196]. Now there are eclipses of both these\r\nstars in every year, which take place below the earth, at stated days\r\nand hours; and when they are above it[197] they are not always visible,\r\nsometimes on account of the clouds, but more frequently, from the\r\nglobe of the earth being opposed to the vault of the heavens[198]. It\r\nwas discovered two hundred years ago, by the sagacity of Hipparchus,\r\nthat the moon is sometimes eclipsed after an interval of five months,\r\nand the sun after an interval of seven[199]; also, that he becomes\r\ninvisible, while above the horizon, twice in every thirty days, but\r\nthat this is seen in different places at different times. But the most\r\nwonderful circumstance is, that while it is admitted that the moon is\r\ndarkened by the shadow of the earth, this occurs at one time on its\r\nwestern, and at another time on its eastern side. And farther, that\r\nalthough, after the rising of the sun, that darkening shadow ought\r\nto be below the earth, yet it has once happened, that the moon has\r\nbeen eclipsed in the west, while both the luminaries have been above\r\nthe horizon[200]. And as to their both being invisible in the space\r\nof fifteen days, this very thing happened while the Vespasians were\r\nemperors, the father being consul for the third time, and the son for\r\nthe second[201].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11. (14.)—OF THE MOTION OF THE MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the moon, having her horns always turned from the\r\nsun, when she is waxing, looks towards the east; when she is waning,\r\ntowards the west. Also, that, from the second day after the change,\r\nshe adds 47-1/2 minutes[202] each day, until she is full, and again\r\ndecreases at the same rate, and that she always becomes invisible when\r\nshe is within 14 degrees of the sun. This is an argument of the greater\r\nsize of the planets than of the moon, since these emerge when they\r\nare at the distance of 7 degrees only[203]. But their altitude causes\r\nthem to appear much smaller, as we observe that, during the day, the\r\nbrightness of the sun prevents those bodies from being seen which are\r\nfixed in the firmament, although they shine then as well as in the\r\nnight: that this is the case is proved by eclipses, and by descending\r\ninto very deep wells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (15.)—OF THE MOTIONS OF THE PLANETS AND THE GENERAL LAWS OF\r\nTHEIR ASPECTS[204].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three planets, which, as we have said, are situated above the\r\nsun[205], are visible when they come into conjunction with him.\r\nThey rise visibly[206] in the morning, when they are not more than\r\n11 degrees from the sun[207]; they are afterwards directed by the\r\ncontact of his rays[208], and when they attain the trine aspect,\r\nat the distance of 120 degrees, they take their morning stationary\r\npositions[209], which are termed primary; afterwards, when they are\r\nin opposition to the sun, they rise at the distance of 180 degrees\r\nfrom him. And again advancing on the other side to the 120th degree,\r\nthey attain their evening stations, which are termed secondary, until\r\nthe sun having arrived within 12 degrees of them, what is called their\r\nevening setting becomes no longer visible[210]. Mars, as being nearer\r\nto the sun, feels the influence of his rays in the quadrature, at the\r\ndistance of 90 degrees, whence that motion receives its name, being\r\ntermed, from the two risings, respectively the first and the second\r\nnonagenarian[211]. This planet passes from one station to another in\r\nsix months, or is two months in each sign; the two other planets do not\r\nspend more than four months in passing from station to station.\r\n\r\nThe two inferior planets are, in like manner, concealed in their\r\nevening conjunction, and, when they have left the sun, they rise in\r\nthe morning the same number of degrees distant from him. After having\r\narrived at their point of greatest elongation[212], they then follow\r\nthe sun, and having overtaken him at their morning setting, they\r\nbecome invisible and pass beyond him. They then rise in the evening,\r\nat the distances which were mentioned above. After this they return\r\nback to the sun and are concealed in their evening setting. The star\r\nVenus becomes stationary when at its two points of greatest elongation,\r\nthat of the morning and of the evening, according to their respective\r\nrisings. The stationary points of Mercury are so very brief, that they\r\ncannot be correctly observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—WHY THE SAME STARS APPEAR AT SOME TIMES MORE LOFTY AND AT\r\nOTHER TIMES MORE NEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above is an account of the aspects and the occultations of the\r\nplanets, a subject which is rendered very complicated by their motions,\r\nand is involved in much that is wonderful; especially, when we observe\r\nthat they change their size and colour, and that the same stars at\r\none time approach the north, and then go to the south, and are now\r\nseen near the earth, and then suddenly approach the heavens. If on\r\nthis subject I deliver opinions different from my predecessors, I\r\nacknowledge that I am indebted for them to those individuals who first\r\npointed out to us the proper mode of inquiry; let no one then ever\r\ndespair of benefiting future ages.\r\n\r\nBut these things depend upon many different causes. The first cause is\r\nthe nature of the circles described by the stars, which the Greeks term\r\n_apsides_[213], for we are obliged to use Greek terms. Now each of the\r\nplanets has its own circle, and this a different one from that of the\r\nworld[214]; because the earth is placed in the centre of the heavens,\r\nwith respect to the two extremities, which are called the poles, and\r\nalso in that of the zodiac, which is situated obliquely between them.\r\nAnd all these things are made evident by the infallible results which\r\nwe obtain by the use of the compasses[215]. Hence the apsides of the\r\nplanets have each of them different centres, and consequently they have\r\ndifferent orbits and motions, since it necessarily follows, that the\r\ninterior apsides are the shortest.\r\n\r\n(16.) The apsides which are the highest from the centre of the earth\r\nare, for Saturn, when he is in Scorpio, for Jupiter in Virgo, for\r\nMars in Leo, for the Sun in Gemini, for Venus in Sagittarius, and for\r\nMercury in Capricorn, each of them in the middle of these signs; while\r\nin the opposite signs, they are the lowest and nearest to the centre\r\nof the earth[216]. Hence it is that they appear to move more slowly\r\nwhen they are carried along the highest circuit; not that their actual\r\nmotions are accelerated or retarded, these being fixed and determinate\r\nfor each of them; but because it necessarily follows, that lines drawn\r\nfrom the highest apsis must approach nearer to each other at the\r\ncentre, like the spokes of a wheel; and that the same motion seems to\r\nbe at one time greater, and at another time less, according to the\r\ndistance from the centre.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the altitudes of the planets is, that their highest\r\napsides, with relation to their own centres, are in different signs\r\nfrom those mentioned above[217]. Saturn is in the 20th degree of Libra,\r\nJupiter in the 15th of Cancer, Mars in the 28th of Capricorn, the Sun\r\nin the 19th of Aries, Venus in the 27th of Pisces, Mercury in the 15th\r\nof Virgo, and the Moon in the 3rd of Taurus.\r\n\r\nThe third cause of the altitude depends on the form of the heavens,\r\nnot on that of the orbits; the stars appearing to the eye to mount\r\nup and to descend through the depth of the air[218]. With this cause\r\nis connected that which depends on the latitude of the planets and\r\nthe obliquity of the zodiac. It is through this belt that the stars\r\nwhich I have spoken of are carried, nor is there any part of the world\r\nhabitable, except what lies under it[219]; the remainder, which is at\r\nthe poles, being in a wild desert state. The planet Venus alone exceeds\r\nit by 2 degrees, which we may suppose to be the cause why some animals\r\nare produced even in these desert regions of the earth. The moon also\r\nwanders the whole breadth of the zodiac, but never exceeds it. Next\r\nto these the planet Mercury moves through the greatest space; yet out\r\nof the 12 degrees (for there are so many degrees of latitude in the\r\nzodiac[220]), it does not pass through more than 8, nor does it go\r\nequally through these, 2 of them being in the middle of the zodiac, 4\r\nin the upper part, and 2 in the lower part[221]. Next to these the Sun\r\nis carried through the middle of the zodiac, winding unequally through\r\nthe two parts of his tortuous circuit[222]. The star Mars occupies the\r\nfour middle degrees; Jupiter the middle degree and the two above it;\r\nSaturn, like the sun, occupies two[223]. The above is an account of\r\nthe latitudes as they descend to the south or ascend to the north[224].\r\nHence it is plain that the generality of persons are mistaken in\r\nsupposing the third cause of the apparent altitude to depend on the\r\nstars rising from the earth and climbing up the heavens. But to refute\r\nthis opinion it is necessary to consider the subject with very great\r\nminuteness, and to embrace all the causes.\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted, that the stars[225], at the time of their\r\nevening setting, are nearest to the earth, both with respect to\r\nlatitude and altitude[226], that they are at the commencement of both\r\nat their morning risings, and that they become stationary at the middle\r\npoints of their latitudes, what are called the ecliptics[227]. It is,\r\nmoreover, acknowledged, that their motion is increased when they are\r\nin the vicinity of the earth, and diminished when they are removed to\r\na greater altitude[228]; a point which is most clearly proved by the\r\ndifferent altitudes of the moon. There is no doubt that it is also\r\nincreased at the morning risings[229], and that the three superior\r\nplanets are retarded, as they advance from the first station to the\r\nsecond. And since this is the case, it is evident, that the latitudes\r\nare increased from the time of their morning risings, since the motions\r\nafterwards appear to receive less addition; but they gain their\r\naltitude in the first station, since the rate of their motion then\r\nbegins to diminish[230], and the stars to recede.\r\n\r\nAnd the reason of this must be particularly set forth. When the planets\r\nare struck by the rays of the sun, in the situation which I have\r\ndescribed, _i. e._ in their quadrature, they are prevented from holding\r\non their straight forward course, and are raised on high by the force\r\nof the fire[231]. This cannot be immediately perceived by the eye, and\r\ntherefore they seem to be stationary, and hence the term station is\r\nderived. Afterwards the violence of the rays increases, and the vapour\r\nbeing beaten back forces them to recede.\r\n\r\nThis exists in a greater degree in their evening risings, the sun being\r\nthen turned entirely from them, when they are drawn into the highest\r\napsides; and they are then the least visible, since they are at their\r\ngreatest altitude and are carried along with the least motion, as much\r\nless indeed as this takes place in the highest signs of the apsides. At\r\nthe time of the evening rising the latitude decreases and becomes less\r\nas the motion is diminished, and it does not increase again until they\r\narrive at the second station, when the altitude is also diminished;\r\nthe sun’s rays then coming from the other side, the same force now\r\ntherefore propels them towards the earth which before raised them into\r\nthe heavens, from their former triangular aspect[232]. So different is\r\nthe effect whether the rays strike the planets from below or come to\r\nthem from above. And all these circumstances produce much more effect\r\nwhen they occur in the evening setting. This is the doctrine of the\r\nsuperior planets; that of the others is more difficult, and has never\r\nbeen laid down by any one before me[233].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (17.)—WHY THE SAME STARS HAVE DIFFERENT MOTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must first state the cause, why the star Venus never recedes from the\r\nsun more than 46 degrees, nor Mercury more than 23[234], while they\r\nfrequently return to the sun within this distance[235]. As they are\r\nsituated below the sun, they have both of them their apsides turned in\r\nthe contrary direction; their orbits are as much below the earth as\r\nthose of the stars above mentioned are above it, and therefore they\r\ncannot recede any farther, since the curve of their apsides has no\r\ngreater longitude[236]. The extreme parts of their apsides therefore\r\nassign the limits to each of them in the same manner, and compensate,\r\nas it were, for the small extent of their longitudes, by the great\r\ndivergence of their latitudes[237]. It may be asked, why do they not\r\nalways proceed as far as the 46th and the 23rd degrees respectively?\r\nThey in reality do so, but the theory fails us here. For it would\r\nappear that the apsides are themselves moved, as they never pass over\r\nthe sun[238]. When therefore they have arrived at the extremities\r\nof their orbits on either side, the stars are then supposed to have\r\nproceeded to their greatest distance; when they have been a certain\r\nnumber of degrees within their orbits, they are then supposed to return\r\nmore rapidly, since the extreme point in each is the same. And on this\r\naccount it is that the direction of their motion appears to be changed.\r\nFor the superior planets are carried along the most quickly in their\r\nevening setting, while these move the most slowly; the former are at\r\ntheir greatest distance from the earth when they move the most slowly,\r\nthe latter when they move the most quickly. The former are accelerated\r\nwhen nearest to the earth, the latter when at the extremity of the\r\ncircle; in the former the rapidity of the motion begins to diminish at\r\ntheir morning risings, in the latter it begins to increase; the former\r\nare retrograde from their morning to their evening station, while Venus\r\nis retrograde from the evening to the morning station. She begins to\r\nincrease her latitude from her morning rising, her altitude follows the\r\nsun from her morning station, her motion being the quickest and her\r\naltitude the greatest in her morning setting. Her latitude decreases\r\nand her altitude diminishes from her evening rising, she becomes\r\nretrograde, and at the same time decreases in her altitude from her\r\nevening station.\r\n\r\nAgain, the star Mercury, in the same way, mounts up in both\r\ndirections[239] from his morning rising, and having followed the\r\nsun through a space of 15 degrees, he becomes almost stationary for\r\nfour days. Presently he diminishes his altitude, and recedes from\r\nhis evening setting to his morning rising. Mercury and the Moon are\r\nthe only planets which descend for the same number of days that they\r\nascend. Venus ascends for fifteen days and somewhat more; Saturn and\r\nJupiter descend in twice that number of days, and Mars in four times.\r\nSo great is the variety of nature! The reason of it is, however,\r\nevident; for those planets which are forced up by the vapour of the sun\r\nlikewise descend with difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—GENERAL LAWS[240] OF THE PLANETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many other secrets of nature in these points, as well as the\r\nlaws to which they are subject, which might be mentioned. For example,\r\nthe planet Mars, whose course is the most difficult to observe[241],\r\nnever becomes stationary when Jupiter is in the trine aspect, very\r\nrarely when he is 60 degrees from the sun, which number is one-sixth of\r\nthe circuit of the heavens[242]; nor does he ever rise in the same sign\r\nwith Jupiter, except in Cancer and Leo. The star Mercury seldom has\r\nhis evening risings in Pisces, but very frequently in Virgo, and his\r\nmorning risings in Libra; he has also his morning rising in Aquarius,\r\nvery rarely in Leo. He never becomes retrograde either in Taurus or\r\nin Gemini, nor until the 25th degree of Cancer. The Moon makes her\r\ndouble conjunction with the sun in no other sign except Gemini, while\r\nSagittarius is the only sign in which she has sometimes no conjunction\r\nat all. The old and the new moon are visible on the same day or night\r\nin no other sign except Aries, and indeed it has happened very seldom\r\nto any one to have witnessed it. Prom this circumstance it was that the\r\ntale of Lynceus’s quick-sightedness originated[243]. Saturn and Mars\r\nare invisible at most for 170 days; Jupiter for 36, or, at the least,\r\nfor 10 days less than this; Venus for 69, or, at the least, for 52;\r\nMercury for 13, or, at the most, for 18[244].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16. (18.)—THE REASON WHY THE STARS ARE OF DIFFERENT COLOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference of their colour depends on the difference in their\r\naltitudes; for they acquire a resemblance to those planets into the\r\nvapour of which they are carried, the orbit of each tinging those\r\nthat approach it in each direction. A colder planet renders one that\r\napproaches it paler, one more hot renders it redder, a windy planet\r\ngives it a lowering aspect, while the sun, at the union of their\r\napsides, or the extremity of their orbits, completely obscures them.\r\nEach of the planets has its peculiar colour[245]; Saturn is white,\r\nJupiter brilliant, Mars fiery, Lucifer is glowing, Vesper refulgent,\r\nMercury sparkling, the Moon mild; the Sun, when he rises, is blazing,\r\nafterwards he becomes radiating. The appearance of the stars, which\r\nare fixed in the firmament, is also affected by these causes. At one\r\ntime we see a dense cluster of stars around the moon, when she is only\r\nhalf-enlightened, and when they are viewed in a serene evening; while,\r\nat another time, when the moon is full, there are so few to be seen,\r\nthat we wonder whither they are fled; and this is also the case when\r\nthe rays of the sun, or of any of the above-mentioned bodies[246], have\r\ndazzled our sight. And, indeed, the moon herself is, without doubt,\r\ndifferently affected at different times by the rays of the sun; when\r\nshe is entering them, the convexity of the heavens[247] rendering them\r\nmore feeble than when they fall upon her more directly[248]. Hence,\r\nwhen she is at a right angle to the sun, she is half-enlightened; when\r\nin the trine aspect, she presents an imperfect orb[249], while, in\r\nopposition, she is full. Again, when she is waning, she goes through\r\nthe same gradations, and in the same order, as the three stars that are\r\nsuperior to the sun[250].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17. (19.)—OF THE MOTION OF THE SUN AND THE CAUSE OF THE\r\nIRREGULARITY OF THE DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sun himself is in four different states; twice the night is equal\r\nto the day, in the Spring and in the Autumn, when he is opposed to the\r\ncentre of the earth[251], in the 8th degree of Aries and Libra[252].\r\nThe length of the day and the night is then twice changed, when the\r\nday increases in length, from the winter solstice in the 8th degree of\r\nCapricorn, and afterwards, when the night increases in length from the\r\nsummer solstice in the 8th degree of Cancer[253]. The cause of this\r\ninequality is the obliquity of the zodiac, since there is, at every\r\nmoment of time, an equal portion of the firmament above and below the\r\nhorizon. But the signs which mount directly upwards, when they rise,\r\nretain the light for a longer space, while those that are more oblique\r\npass along more quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18. (20.)—WHY THUNDER IS ASCRIBED TO JUPITER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known, what has been discovered by men who are the\r\nmost eminent for their learning, in consequence of their assiduous\r\nobservations of the heavens, that the fires which fall upon the earth,\r\nand receive the name of thunder-bolts, proceed from the three superior\r\nstars[254], but principally from the one which is situated in the\r\nmiddle. It may perhaps depend on the superabundance of moisture from\r\nthe superior orbit communicating with the heat from the inferior, which\r\nare expelled in this manner[255]; and hence it is commonly said, the\r\nthunder-bolts are darted by Jupiter. And as, in burning wood, the burnt\r\npart is cast off with a crackling noise, so does the star throw off\r\nthis celestial fire, bearing the omens of future events, even the part\r\nwhich is thrown off not losing its divine operation. And this takes\r\nplace more particularly when the air is in an unsettled state, either\r\nbecause the moisture which is then collected excites the greatest\r\nquantity of fire, or because the air is disturbed, as if by the\r\nparturition of the pregnant star.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19. (21.)—OF THE DISTANCES OF THE STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany persons have attempted to discover the distance of the stars\r\nfrom the earth, and they have published as the result, that the\r\nsun is nineteen times as far from the moon, as the moon herself is\r\nfrom the earth[256]. Pythagoras, who was a man of a very sagacious\r\nmind, computed the distance from the earth to the moon to be 126,000\r\nfurlongs, that from her to the sun is double this distance, and that\r\nit is three times this distance to the twelve signs[257]; and this was\r\nalso the opinion of our countryman, Gallus Sulpicius[258].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20. (22.)—OF THE HARMONY OF THE STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPythagoras, employing the terms that are used in music, sometimes names\r\nthe distance between the Earth and the Moon a tone; from her to Mercury\r\nhe supposes to be half this space, and about the same from him to\r\nVenus. From her to the Sun is a tone and a half; from the Sun to Mars\r\nis a tone, the same as from the Earth to the Moon; from him there is\r\nhalf a tone to Jupiter, from Jupiter to Saturn also half a tone, and\r\nthence a tone and a half to the zodiac. Hence there are seven tones,\r\nwhich he terms the diapason harmony[259], meaning the whole compass\r\nof the notes. In this, Saturn is said to move in the Doric time,\r\nJupiter in the Phrygian[260], and so forth of the rest; but this is a\r\nrefinement rather amusing than useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21. (23.)—OF THE DIMENSIONS OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stadium is equal to 125 of our Roman paces, or 625 feet[261].\r\nPosidonius[262] supposes that there is a space of not less than 40\r\nstadia around the earth, whence mists[263], winds and clouds[263]\r\nproceed; beyond this he supposes that the air is pure and liquid,\r\nconsisting of uninterrupted light; from the clouded region to the\r\nmoon there is a space of 2,000,000 of stadia, and thence to the sun\r\nof 500,000,000[264]. It is in consequence of this space that the sun,\r\nnotwithstanding his immense magnitude, does not burn the earth. Many\r\npersons have imagined that the clouds rise to the height of 900 stadia.\r\nThese points are not completely made out, and are difficult to explain;\r\nbut we have given the best account of them that has been published, and\r\nif we may be allowed, in any degree, to pursue these investigations,\r\nthere is one infallible geometrical principle, which we cannot reject.\r\nNot that we can ascertain the exact dimensions (for to profess to do\r\nthis would be almost the act of a madman), but that the mind may have\r\nsome estimate to direct its conjectures. Now it is evident that the\r\norbit through which the sun passes consists of nearly 366 degrees,\r\nand that the diameter is always the third part and a little less than\r\nthe seventh of the circumference[265]. Then taking the half of this\r\n(for the earth is placed in the centre) it will follow, that nearly\r\none-sixth part of the immense space, which the mind conceives as\r\nconstituting the orbit of the sun round the earth, will compose his\r\naltitude. That of the moon will be one-twelfth part, since her course\r\nis so much shorter than that of the sun; she is therefore carried\r\nalong midway between the sun and the earth[266]. It is astonishing to\r\nwhat an extent the weakness of the mind will proceed, urged on by a\r\nlittle success, as in the above-mentioned instance, to give full scope\r\nto its impudence! Thus, having ventured to guess at the space between\r\nthe sun and the earth, we do the same with respect to the heavens,\r\nbecause he is situated midway between them; so that we may come to know\r\nthe measure of the whole world in inches. For if the diameter consist\r\nof seven parts, there will be twenty-two of the same parts in the\r\ncircumference; as if we could measure the heavens by a plumb-line!\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian calculation, which was made out by Petosiris and\r\nNecepsos, supposes that each degree of the lunar orbit (which, as\r\nI have said, is the least) consists of little more than 33 stadia;\r\nin the very large orbit of Saturn the number is double; in that of\r\nthe sun, which, as we have said, is in the middle[267], we have\r\nthe half of the sum of these numbers. And this is indeed a very\r\nmodest calculation[268], since if we add to the orbit of Saturn the\r\ndistance from him to the zodiac, we shall have an infinite number of\r\ndegrees[269].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (24.)—OF THE STARS WHICH APPEAR SUDDENLY, OR OF COMETS[270].\r\n\r\n\r\nA few things still remain to be said concerning the world; for stars\r\nare suddenly formed in the heavens themselves; of these there are\r\nvarious kinds.\r\n\r\n(25.) The Greeks name these stars _comets_[271]; we name them Crinitæ,\r\nas if shaggy with bloody locks, and surrounded with bristles like hair.\r\nThose stars, which have a mane hanging down from their lower part, like\r\na long beard, are named Pogoniæ[272]. Those that are named Acontiæ[273]\r\nvibrate like a dart with a very quick motion. It was one of this kind\r\nwhich the Emperor Titus described in his very excellent poem, as having\r\nbeen seen in his fifth consulship; and this was the last of these\r\nbodies which has been observed. When they are short and pointed they\r\nare named Xiphiæ[274]; these are the pale kind; they shine like a\r\nsword and are without any rays; while we name those Discei[275], which,\r\nbeing of an amber colour, in conformity with their name, emit a few\r\nrays from their margin only. A kind named Pitheus[276] exhibits the\r\nfigure of a cask, appearing convex and emitting a smoky light. The kind\r\nnamed Cerastias[277] has the appearance of a horn; it is like the one\r\nwhich was visible when the Greeks fought at Salamis. Lampadias[278]\r\nis like a burning torch; Hippias[279] is like a horse’s mane; it has\r\na very rapid motion, like a circle revolving on itself. There is also\r\na white comet, with silver hair, so brilliant that it can scarcely be\r\nlooked at, exhibiting, as it were, the aspect of the Deity in a human\r\nform. There are some also that are shaggy, having the appearance of\r\na fleece, surrounded by a kind of crown. There was one, where the\r\nappearance of a mane was changed into that of a spear; it happened in\r\nthe 109th olympiad, in the 398th year of the City[280]. The shortest\r\ntime during which any one of them has been observed to be visible is 7\r\ndays, the longest 180 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—THEIR NATURE, SITUATION, AND SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of them move about in the manner of planets[281], others remain\r\nstationary. They are almost all of them seen towards the north[282],\r\nnot indeed in any particular portion of it, but generally in that\r\nwhite part of it which has obtained the name of the Milky Way.\r\nAristotle informs us that several of them are to be seen at the same\r\ntime[283], but this, as far as I know, has not been observed by any\r\none else; also that they prognosticate high winds and great heat[284].\r\nThey are also visible in the winter months, and about the south pole,\r\nbut they have no rays proceeding from them. There was a dreadful one\r\nobserved by the Æthiopians and the Egyptians, to which Typhon, a king\r\nof that period, gave his own name; it had a fiery appearance, and\r\nwas twisted like a spiral; its aspect was hideous, nor was it like a\r\nstar, but rather like a knot of fire[285]. Sometimes there are hairs\r\nattached to the planets and the other stars. Comets are never seen\r\nin the western part of the heavens. It is generally regarded as a\r\nterrific star, and one not easily expiated; as was the case with the\r\ncivil commotions in the consulship of Octavius, and also in the war\r\nof Pompey and Cæsar[286]. And in our own age, about the time when\r\nClaudius Cæsar was poisoned and left the Empire to Domitius Nero, and\r\nafterwards, while the latter was Emperor[287], there was one which was\r\nalmost constantly seen and was very frightful. It is thought important\r\nto notice towards what part it darts its beams, or from what star\r\nit receives its influence, what it resembles, and in what places it\r\nshines. If it resembles a flute, it portends something unfavourable\r\nrespecting music; if it appears in the parts of the signs referred to\r\nthe secret members, something respecting lewdness of manners; something\r\nrespecting wit and learning, if they form a triangular or quadrangular\r\nfigure with the position of some of the fixed stars; and that some one\r\nwill be poisoned, if they appear in the head of either the northern or\r\nthe southern serpent.\r\n\r\nRome is the only place in the whole world where there is a temple\r\ndedicated to a comet; it was thought by the late Emperor Augustus to\r\nbe auspicious to him, from its appearing during the games which he\r\nwas celebrating in honour of Venus Genetrix, not long after the death\r\nof his father Cæsar, in the College which was founded by him[288].\r\nHe expressed his joy in these terms: “During the very time of these\r\ngames of mine, a hairy star was seen during seven days, in the part of\r\nthe heavens which is under the Great Bear. It rose about the eleventh\r\nhour of the day[289], was very bright, and was conspicuous in all\r\nparts of the earth. The common people supposed the star to indicate,\r\nthat the soul of Cæsar was admitted among the immortal Gods; under\r\nwhich designation it was that the star was placed on the bust which\r\nwas lately consecrated in the forum[290].” This is what he proclaimed\r\nin public, but, in secret, he rejoiced at this auspicious omen,\r\ninterpreting it as produced for himself; and, to confess the truth, it\r\nreally proved a salutary omen for the world at large[291].\r\n\r\nSome persons suppose that these stars are permanent, and that they\r\nmove through their proper orbits, but that they are only visible when\r\nthey recede from the sun. Others suppose that they are produced by an\r\naccidental vapour together with the force of fire, and that, from this\r\ncircumstance, they are liable to be dissipated[292].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24. (26.)—THE DOCTRINE OF HIPPARCHUS[293] ABOUT THE STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis same Hipparchus, who can never be sufficiently commended, as one\r\nwho more especially proved the relation of the stars to man, and that\r\nour souls are a portion of heaven, discovered a new star that was\r\nproduced in his own age, and, by observing its motions on the day in\r\nwhich it shone, he was led to doubt whether it does not often happen,\r\nthat those stars have motion which we suppose to be fixed. And the same\r\nindividual attempted, what might seem presumptuous even in a deity,\r\nviz. to number the stars for posterity and to express their relations\r\nby appropriate names; having previously devised instruments[294], by\r\nwhich he might mark the places and the magnitudes of each individual\r\nstar. In this way it might be easily discovered, not only whether they\r\nwere destroyed or produced, but whether they changed their relative\r\npositions, and likewise, whether they were increased or diminished;\r\nthe heavens being thus left as an inheritance to any one, who might be\r\nfound competent to complete his plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—EXAMPLES FROM HISTORY OF CELESTIAL PRODIGIES; _FACES_,\r\n_LAMPADES_, AND _BOLIDES_[295].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _faces_ shine brilliantly, but they are never seen excepting when\r\nthey are falling[296]; one of these darted across the heavens, in\r\nthe sight of all the people, at noon-day, when Germanicus Cæsar was\r\nexhibiting a show of gladiators[297]. There are two kinds of them;\r\nthose which are called _lampades_ and those which are called _bolides_,\r\none of which latter was seen during the troubles at Mutina[298]. They\r\ndiffer from each other in this respect, that the _faces_ produce a long\r\ntrain of light, the fore-part only being on fire; while the _bolides_,\r\nbeing entirely in a state of combustion, leave a still longer track\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—_TRABES CELESTES_; _CHASMA CŒLI._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _trabes_ also, which are named δοκοὶ[299], shine in the same\r\nmanner; one of these was seen at the time when the Lacedæmonians, by\r\nbeing conquered at sea, lost their influence in Greece. An opening\r\nsometimes takes place in the firmament, which is named _chasma_[300].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27. (27.)—OF THE COLOURS OF THE SKY AND OF CELESTIAL FLAME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a flame of a bloody appearance (and nothing is more dreaded\r\nby mortals) which falls down upon the earth[301], such as was seen in\r\nthe third year of the 103rd olympiad, when King Philip was disturbing\r\nGreece. But my opinion is, that these, like everything else, occur at\r\nstated, natural periods, and are not produced, as some persons imagine,\r\nfrom a variety of causes, such as their fine genius may suggest. They\r\nhave indeed been the precursors of great evils, but I conceive that\r\nthe evils occurred, not because the prodigies took place, but that\r\nthese took place because the evils were appointed to occur at that\r\nperiod[302]. Their cause is obscure in consequence of their rarity, and\r\ntherefore we are not as well acquainted with them as we are with the\r\nrising of the stars, which I have mentioned, and with eclipses and many\r\nother things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28. (28.)—OF CELESTIAL CORONÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nStars are occasionally seen along with the sun, for whole days\r\ntogether, and generally round its orb, like wreaths made of the ears\r\nof corn, or circles of various colours[303]; such as occurred when\r\nAugustus, while a very young man, was entering the city, after the\r\ndeath of his father, in order to take upon himself the great name which\r\nhe assumed[304]. (29.) The same _coronæ_ occur about the moon and also\r\nabout the principal stars, which are stationary in the heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—OF SUDDEN CIRCLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bow appeared round the sun in the consulship of L. Opimius and L.\r\nFabius[305], and a circle in that of C. Porcius and M. Acilius. (30.)\r\nThere was a little circle of a red colour in the consulship of L.\r\nJulius and P. Rutilius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—OF UNUSUALLY LONG ECLIPSES OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEclipses of the sun also take place which are portentous and unusually\r\nlong, such as occurred when Cæsar the Dictator was slain, and in the\r\nwar against Antony, the sun remained dim for almost a whole year[306].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31. (31.)—MANY SUNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again, many suns have been seen at the same time[307]; not above\r\nor below the real sun, but in an oblique direction, never near nor\r\nopposite to the earth, nor in the night, but either in the east or\r\nin the west. They are said to have been seen once at noon in the\r\nBosphorus, and to have continued from morning until sunset. Our\r\nancestors have frequently seen three suns at the same time[308], as\r\nwas the case in the consulship of Sp. Postumius and L. Mucius, of L.\r\nMarcius and M. Portius, that of M. Antony and Dolabella, and that of M.\r\nLepidus and L. Plancus. And we have ourselves seen one during the reign\r\nof the late Emperor Claudius, when he was consul along with Corn.\r\nOrfitus. We have no account transmitted to us of more than three having\r\nbeen seen at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32. (32.)—MANY MOONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree moons have also been seen, as was the case in the consulship of\r\nCn. Domitius and C. Fannius; they have generally been named nocturnal\r\nsuns[309].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33. (33.)—DAYLIGHT IN THE NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bright light has been seen proceeding from the heavens in the\r\nnight time, as was the case in the consulship of C. Cæcilius and Cn.\r\nPapirius, and at many other times, so that there has been a kind of\r\ndaylight in the night[310].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34. (34.)—BURNING SHIELDS[311].\r\n\r\n\r\nA burning shield darted across at sunset, from west to east, throwing\r\nout sparks, in the consulship of L. Valerius and C. Marius[312].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35. (35.)—AN OMINOUS APPEARANCE IN THE HEAVENS, THAT WAS SEEN\r\nONCE ONLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have an account of a spark falling from a star, and increasing as it\r\napproached the earth, until it became of the size of the moon, shining\r\nas through a cloud[313]; it afterwards returned into the heavens and\r\nwas converted into a _lampas_; this occurred in the consulship of Cn.\r\nOctavius and C. Scribonius. It was seen by Silanus, the proconsul, and\r\nhis attendants[314].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36. (36.)—OF STARS WHICH MOVE ABOUT IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nStars are seen to move about in various directions, but never without\r\nsome cause, nor without violent winds proceeding from the same\r\nquarter[315].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37. (37.)—OF THE STARS WHICH ARE NAMED CASTOR AND POLLUX[316].\r\n\r\n\r\nThese stars occur both at sea and at land. I have seen, during the\r\nnight-watches of the soldiers, a luminous appearance, like a star,\r\nattached to the javelins on the ramparts. They also settle on the\r\nyard-arms and other parts of ships while sailing, producing a kind\r\nof vocal sound, like that of birds flitting about. When they occur\r\nsingly they are mischievous, so as even to sink the vessels, and if\r\nthey strike on the lower part of the keel, setting them on fire[317].\r\nWhen there are two of them they are considered auspicious, and are\r\nthought to predict a prosperous voyage, as it is said that they drive\r\naway that dreadful and terrific meteor named Helena. On this account\r\ntheir efficacy is ascribed to Castor and Pollux, and they are invoked\r\nas gods. They also occasionally shine round the heads of men in the\r\nevening[318], which is considered as predicting something very\r\nimportant. But there is great uncertainty respecting the cause of all\r\nthese things, and they are concealed in the majesty of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38. (38.)—OF THE AIR AND ON THE CAUSE OF THE SHOWERS OF STONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far I have spoken of the world itself and of the stars. I must now\r\ngive an account of the other remarkable phænomena of the heavens. For\r\nour ancestors have given the name of heavens, or, sometimes, another\r\nname, air, to all the seemingly void space, which diffuses around us\r\nthis vital spirit. It is situated beneath the moon, indeed much lower,\r\nas is admitted by every one who has made observations on it, and is\r\ncomposed of a great quantity of air from the upper regions, mixed with\r\na great quantity of terrestrial vapour, the two forming a compound.\r\nHence proceed clouds, thunder and lightning of all kinds; hence also\r\nhail, frost, showers, storms and whirlwinds; hence proceed many of the\r\nevils incident to mortals, and the mutual contests of the various parts\r\nof nature. The force of the stars keeps down all terrestrial things\r\nwhich tend towards the heavens, and the same force attracts to itself\r\nthose things which do not go there spontaneously. The showers fall,\r\nmists rise up, rivers are dried up, hail-storms rush down, the rays of\r\nthe sun parch the earth, and impel it from all quarters towards the\r\ncentre. The same rays, still unbroken, dart back again, and carry with\r\nthem whatever they can take up. Vapour falls from on high and returns\r\nagain to the same place. Winds arise which contain nothing, but which\r\nreturn loaded with spoils. The breathing of so many animals draws down\r\nthe spirit from the higher regions; but this tends to go in a contrary\r\ndirection, and the earth pours out its spirit into the void space of\r\nthe heavens. Thus nature moving to and fro, as if impelled by some\r\nmachine[319], discord is kindled by the rapid motion of the world.\r\nNor is the contest allowed to cease, for she is continually whirled\r\nround and lays open the causes of all things, forming an immense globe\r\nabout the earth, while she again, from time to time, covers this\r\nother firmament with clouds[320]. This is the region of the winds.\r\nHere their nature principally originates, as well as the causes of\r\nalmost all other things[321]; since most persons ascribe the darting\r\nof thunder and lightning to their violence. And to the same cause are\r\nassigned the showers of stones, these having been previously taken up\r\nby the wind, as well as many other bodies in the same way. On this\r\naccount we must enter more at large on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39. (39.)—OF THE STATED SEASONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that there are causes of the seasons and of other things\r\nwhich have been stated, while there are some things which are casual,\r\nor of which the reason has not yet been discovered. For who can doubt\r\nthat summer and winter, and the annual revolution of the seasons are\r\ncaused by the motion of the stars[322]? As therefore the nature of\r\nthe sun is understood to influence the temperature of the year, so\r\neach of the other stars has its specific power, which produces its\r\nappropriate effects. Some abound in a fluid retaining its liquid state,\r\nothers, in the same fluid concreted into hoar frost, compressed into\r\nsnow, or frozen into hail; some are prolific in winds, some in heat,\r\nsome in vapours, some in dew, some in cold. But these bodies must not\r\nbe supposed to be actually of the size which they appear, since the\r\nconsideration of their immense height clearly proves, that none of them\r\nare less than the moon. Each of them exercises its influence over us\r\nby its own motions; this is particularly observable with respect to\r\nSaturn, which produces a great quantity of rain in its transits. Nor is\r\nthis power confined to the stars which change their situations, but is\r\nfound to exist in many of the fixed stars, whenever they are impelled\r\nby the force of any of the planets, or excited by the impulse of their\r\nrays; as we find to be the case with respect to the Suculæ[323],\r\nwhich the Greeks, in reference to their rainy nature, have termed the\r\nHyades[324]. There are also certain events which occur spontaneously,\r\nand at stated periods, as the rising of the Kids[325]. The star\r\nArcturus scarcely ever rises without storms of hail occurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40. (40.)—OF THE RISING OF THE DOG-STAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho is there that does not know that the vapour of the sun is kindled\r\nby the rising of the Dog-star? The most powerful effects are felt on\r\nthe earth from this star. When it rises, the seas are troubled, the\r\nwines in our cellars ferment, and stagnant waters are set in motion.\r\nThere is a wild beast, named by the Egyptians Oryx, which, when the\r\nstar rises, is said to stand opposite to it, to look steadfastly at it,\r\nand then to sneeze, as if it were worshiping it[326]. There is no doubt\r\nthat dogs, during the whole of this period, are peculiarly disposed to\r\nbecome rabid[327].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41. (41.)—OF THE REGULAR INFLUENCE OF THE DIFFERENT SEASONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is moreover a peculiar influence in the different degrees of\r\ncertain signs, as in the autumnal equinox, and also in the winter\r\nsolstice, when we find that a particular star is connected with\r\nthe state of the weather[328]. It is not so much the recurrence of\r\nshowers and storms, as of various circumstances, which act both upon\r\nanimals and vegetables. Some are planet-struck[329], and others, at\r\nstated times, are affected in the bowels, the sinews, the head, or\r\nthe intellect. The olive, the white poplar, and the willow turn\r\ntheir leaves round at the summer solstice. The herb pulegium, when\r\ndried and hanging up in a house, blossoms on the very day of the\r\nwinter solstice, and bladders burst in consequence of their being\r\ndistended with air[330]. One might wonder at this, did we not observe\r\nevery day, that the plant named heliotrope always looks towards the\r\nsetting sun, and is, at all hours, turned towards him, even when he\r\nis obscured by clouds[331]. It is certain that the bodies of oysters\r\nand of whelks[332], and of shell-fish generally, are increased in size\r\nand again diminished by the influence of the moon. Certain accurate\r\nobservers have found out, that the entrails of the field-mouse[333]\r\ncorrespond in number to the moon’s age, and that the very small animal,\r\nthe ant, feels the power of this luminary, always resting from her\r\nlabours at the change of the moon. And so much the more disgraceful\r\nis our ignorance, as every one acknowledges that the diseases in the\r\neyes of certain beasts of burden increase and diminish according to the\r\nage of the moon. But the immensity of the heavens, divided as they are\r\ninto seventy-two[334] constellations, may serve as an excuse. These are\r\nthe resemblances of certain things, animate and inanimate, into which\r\nthe learned have divided the heavens. In these they have announced\r\n1600 stars, as being remarkable either for their effects or their\r\nappearance; for example, in the tail of the Bull there are seven stars,\r\nwhich are named Vergiliæ[335]; in his forehead are the Suculæ; there\r\nis also Bootes, which follows the seven northern stars[336].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42. (42.)—OF UNCERTAIN STATES OF THE WEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I would not deny, that there may exist showers and winds,\r\nindependent of these causes, since it is certain that an exhalation\r\nproceeds from the earth, which is sometimes moist, and at other times,\r\nin consequence of the vapours, like dense smoke; and also, that clouds\r\nare formed, either from the fluid rising up on high, or from the air\r\nbeing compressed into a fluid[337]. Their density and their substance\r\nis very clearly proved from their intercepting the sun’s rays, which\r\nare visible by divers, even in the deepest waters[338].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43. (43.)—OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt cannot therefore be denied, that fire proceeding from the stars\r\nwhich are above the clouds, may fall on them, as we frequently observe\r\non serene evenings, and that the air is agitated by the impulse, as\r\ndarts when they are hurled whiz through the air. And when it arrives\r\nat the cloud, a discordant kind of vapour is produced, as when hot\r\niron is plunged into water, and a wreath of smoke is evolved. Hence\r\narise squalls. And if wind or vapour be struggling in the cloud,\r\nthunder is discharged; if it bursts out with a flame, there is a\r\nthunderbolt; if it be long in forcing out its way, it is simply a\r\nflash of lightning[339]. By the latter the cloud is simply rent, by\r\nthe former it is shattered. Thunder is produced by the stroke given\r\nto the condensed air, and hence it is that the fire darts from the\r\nchinks of the clouds. It is possible also that the vapour, which has\r\nrisen from the earth, being repelled by the stars, may produce thunder,\r\nwhen it is pent up in a cloud; nature restraining the sound whilst\r\nthe vapour is struggling to escape, but when it does escape, the\r\nsound bursting forth, as is the case with bladders that are distended\r\nwith air. It is possible also that the spirit, whatever it be, may be\r\nkindled by friction, when it is so violently projected. It is possible\r\nthat, by the dashing of the two clouds, the lightning may flash out,\r\nas is the case when two stones are struck against each other. But\r\nall these things appear to be casual. Hence there are thunderbolts\r\nwhich produce no effect, and proceed from no immediate actual cause;\r\nby these mountains and seas are struck, and no injury is done. Those\r\nwhich prognosticate future events proceed from on high and from stated\r\ncauses, and they come from their peculiar stars[340].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—THE ORIGIN OF WINDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn like manner I would not deny that winds, or rather sudden gusts,\r\nare produced by the arid and dry vapours of the earth; that air may\r\nalso be exhaled from water, which can neither be condensed into a mist,\r\nnor compressed into a cloud; that it may be also driven forward by\r\nthe impulse of the sun, since by the term ‘wind’ we mean nothing more\r\nthan a current of air, by whatever means it may be produced[341]. For\r\nwe observe winds to proceed from rivers and bays, and from the sea,\r\neven when it is tranquil; while others, which are named _Altani_, rise\r\nup from the earth; when they come back from the sea they are named\r\n_Tropæi_, but if they go straight on, _Apogæi_[342].\r\n\r\n(44.) The windings and the numerous peaks of mountains, their ridges,\r\nbent into angles or broken into defiles, with the hollow valleys, by\r\ntheir irregular forms, cleaving the air which rebounds from them (which\r\nis also the cause why voices are, in many cases, repeated several times\r\nin succession), give rise to winds.\r\n\r\n(45.) There are certain caves, such as that on the coast of Dalmatia,\r\nwith a vast perpendicular chasm, into which, if a light weight only be\r\nlet down, and although the day be calm, a squall issues from it like a\r\nwhirlwind. The name of the place is Senta. And also, in the province\r\nof Cyrenaica, there is a certain rock, said to be sacred to the south\r\nwind, which it is profane for a human hand to touch, as the south wind\r\nimmediately rolls forwards clouds of sand[343]. There are also, in many\r\nhouses, artificial cavities, formed in the walls[344], which produce\r\ncurrents of air; none of these are without their appropriate cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS RESPECTING WINDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there is a great difference between a gale and a wind[345]. The\r\nformer are uniform and appear to rush forth[346]; they are felt, not\r\nin certain spots only, but over whole countries, not forming breezes\r\nor squalls, but violent storms[347]. Whether they be produced by the\r\nconstant revolution of the world and the opposite motion of the stars,\r\nor whether they both of them depend on the generative spirit of the\r\nnature of things, wandering, as it were, up and down in her womb, or\r\nwhether the air be scourged by the irregular strokes of the wandering\r\nstars[348], or the various projections of their rays, or whether they,\r\neach of them, proceed from their own stars, among which are those that\r\nare nearest to us, or whether they descend from those that are fixed\r\nin the heavens, it is manifest that they are all governed by a law of\r\nnature, which is not altogether unknown, although it be not completely\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n(46.) More than twenty old Greek writers have published their\r\nobservations upon this subject. And this is the more remarkable, seeing\r\nthat there is so much discord in the world, and that it is divided into\r\ndifferent kingdoms, that is into separate members, that there should\r\nhave been so many who have paid attention to these subjects, which are\r\nso difficult to investigate. Especially when we consider the wars and\r\nthe treachery which everywhere prevail; while pirates, the enemies of\r\nthe human race, have possession of all the modes of communication,\r\nso that, at this time, a person may acquire more correct information\r\nabout a country from the writings of those who have never been there,\r\nthan from the inhabitants themselves. Whereas, at this day, in the\r\nblessed peace which we enjoy, under a prince who so greatly encourages\r\nthe advancement of the arts, no new inquiries are set on foot, nor\r\ndo we even make ourselves thoroughly masters of the discoveries of\r\nthe ancients. Not that there were greater rewards held out, from the\r\nadvantages being distributed to a greater number of persons, but that\r\nthere were more individuals who diligently scrutinized these matters,\r\nwith no other prospect but that of benefiting posterity. It is that the\r\nmanners of men are degenerated, not that the advantages are diminished.\r\nAll the seas, as many as there are, being laid open, and a hospitable\r\nreception being given us at every shore, an immense number of people\r\nundertake voyages; but it is for the sake of gain, not of science. Nor\r\ndoes their understanding, which is blinded and bent only on avarice,\r\nperceive that this very thing might be more safely done by means of\r\nscience. Seeing, therefore, that there are so many thousands of persons\r\non the seas, I will treat of the winds with more minuteness than\r\nperhaps might otherwise appear suitable to my undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46. (47.)—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WINDS[349].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancients reckoned only four winds (nor indeed does Homer mention\r\nmore[350]) corresponding to the four parts of the world; a very poor\r\nreason, as we now consider it. The next generation added eight others,\r\nbut this was too refined and minute a division; the moderns have\r\ntaken a middle course, and, out of this great number, have added four\r\nto the original set. There are, therefore, two in each of the four\r\nquarters of the heavens. From the equinoctial rising of the sun[351]\r\nproceeds Subsolanus[352], and, from his brumal rising, Vulturnus[353];\r\nthe former is named by the Greeks Apeliotes[354], the latter Eurus.\r\nFrom the south we have Auster, and from the brumal setting of the\r\nsun, Africus; these were named Notos and Libs. From the equinoctial\r\nsetting proceeds Favonius[355], and from the solstitial setting,\r\nCorus[356]; these were named Zephyrus and Argestes. From the seven\r\nstars comes Septemtrio, between which and the solstitial rising we have\r\nAquilo, named Aparctias and Boreas[357]. By a more minute subdivision\r\nwe interpose four others, Thrascias, between Septemtrio and the\r\nsolstitial setting; Cæcias, between Aquilo and the equinoctial rising;\r\nand Phœnices, between the brumal rising and the south. And also, at\r\nan equal distance from the south and the winter setting, between Libs\r\nand Notos, and compounded of the two, is Libonotos. Nor is this all.\r\nFor some persons have added a wind, which they have named Meses,\r\nbetween Boreas and Cæcias, and one between Eurus and Notos, named\r\nEuronotus[358].\r\n\r\nThere are also certain winds peculiar to certain countries, which do\r\nnot extend beyond certain districts, as Sciron in Attica, deviating a\r\nlittle from Argestes, and not known in the other parts of Greece. In\r\nother places it is a little higher on the card and is named Olympias;\r\nbut all these have gone by the name of Argestes. In some places Cæcias\r\nis named Hellespontia, and the same is done in other cases. In the\r\nprovince of Narbonne the most noted wind is Circius; it is not inferior\r\nto any of the winds in violence, frequently driving the waves before\r\nit, to Ostia[359], straight across the Ligurian sea. Yet this same\r\nwind is unknown in other parts, not even reaching Vienne, a city in\r\nthe same province; for meeting with a high ridge of hills, just before\r\nit arrives at that district, it is checked, although it be the most\r\nviolent of all the winds. Fabius also asserts, that the south winds\r\nnever penetrate into Egypt. Hence this law of nature is obvious, that\r\nwinds have their stated seasons and limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47.—THE PERIODS OF THE WINDS[360].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spring opens the seas for the navigators. In the beginning of this\r\nseason the west winds soften, as it were, the winter sky, the sun\r\nhaving now gained the 25th degree of Aquarius; this is on the sixth day\r\nbefore the Ides of February[361]. This agrees, for the most part, with\r\nall the remarks that I shall subsequently make, only anticipating the\r\nperiod by one day in the intercalary year, and again, preserving the\r\nsame order in the succeeding lustrum[362]. After the eighth day before\r\nthe Calends of March[363], Favonius is called by some Chelidonias[364],\r\nfrom the swallows making their appearance. The wind, which blows for\r\nthe space of nine days, from the seventy-first day after the winter\r\nsolstice[365], is sometimes called Ornithias, from the arrival of\r\nthe birds[366]. In the contrary direction to Favonius is the wind\r\nwhich we name Subsolanus, and this is connected with the rising of\r\nthe Vergiliæ, in the 25th degree of Taurus, six days before the Ides\r\nof May[367], which is the time when south winds prevail: these are\r\nopposite to Septemtrio. The dog-star rises in the hottest time of the\r\nsummer, when the sun is entering the first degree of Leo[368]; this\r\nis fifteen days before the Calends of August. The north winds, which\r\nare called Prodromi[369], precede its rising by about eight days. But\r\nin two days after its rising, the same north winds, which are named\r\nEtesiæ[370], blow more constantly during this period; the vapour\r\nfrom the sun, being increased twofold by the heat of this star, is\r\nsupposed to render these winds more mild; nor are there any which are\r\nmore regular. After these the south winds become more frequent, until\r\nthe appearance of Arcturus[371], which rises eleven days before the\r\nautumnal equinox. At this time Corus sets in; Corus is an autumnal\r\nwind, and is in the opposite direction to Vulturnus. After this, and\r\ngenerally for forty-four days after the equinox, at the setting of the\r\nVergiliæ, the winter commences, which usually happens on the third\r\nof the Ides of November[372]. This is the period of the winter north\r\nwind, which is very unlike the summer north wind, and which is in\r\nthe opposite direction to Africus. For seven days before the winter\r\nsolstice, and for the same length of time after it, the sea becomes\r\ncalm, in order that the king-fishers may rear their young; from this\r\ncircumstance they have obtained the name of the halcyon days[373]; the\r\nrest of the season is winterly[374]. Yet the severity of the storms\r\ndoes not entirely close up the sea. In former times, pirates were\r\ncompelled, by the fear of death, to rush into death, and to brave the\r\nwinter ocean; now we are driven to it by avarice[375].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48.—NATURE OF THE WINDS[376].\r\n\r\n\r\nThose are the coldest winds which are said to blow from the seven\r\nstars, and Corus, which is contiguous to them; these also restrain the\r\nothers and dispel the clouds. The moist winds are Africus, and, still\r\nmore, the Auster of Italy. It is said that, in Pontus, Cæcias attracts\r\nthe clouds. The dry winds are Corus and Vulturnus, especially when\r\nthey are about to cease blowing. The winds that bring snow are Aquilo\r\nand Septemtrio; Septemtrio brings hail, and so does Corus; Auster is\r\nsultry, Vulturnus and Zephyrus are warm. These winds are more dry than\r\nSubsolanus, and generally those which blow from the north and west\r\nare more dry than those which blow from the south and east. Aquilo is\r\nthe most healthy of them all; Auster is unhealthy, and more so when\r\ndry; it is colder, perhaps because it is moist. Animals are supposed\r\nto have less appetite for food when this wind is blowing. The Etesiæ\r\ngenerally cease during the night, and spring up at the third hour\r\nof the day[377]. In Spain and in Asia these winds have an easterly\r\ndirection, in Pontus a northerly, and in other places a southerly\r\ndirection. They blow also after the winter solstice, when they are\r\ncalled Ornithiæ[378], but they are more gentle and continue only for\r\na few days. There are two winds which change their nature with their\r\nsituation; in Africa Auster is attended with a clear sky, while Aquilo\r\ncollects the clouds[379]. Almost all winds blow in their turn, so\r\nthat when one ceases its opposite springs up. When winds which are\r\ncontiguous succeed each other, they go from left to right, in the\r\ndirection of the sun. The fourth day of the moon generally determines\r\ntheir direction for the whole of the monthly period[380]. We are able\r\nto sail in opposite directions by means of the same wind, if we have\r\nthe sails properly set; hence it frequently happens that, in the\r\nnight, vessels going in different directions run against each other.\r\nAuster produces higher winds than Aquilo, because the former blows,\r\nas it were, from the bottom of the sea, while the latter blows on the\r\nsurface; it is therefore after south winds that the most mischievous\r\nearthquakes have occurred. Auster is more violent during the night,\r\nAquilo during the day; winds from the east continue longer than from\r\nthe west. The north winds generally cease blowing on the odd days, and\r\nwe observe the prevalence of the odd numbers in many other parts of\r\nnature; the male winds are therefore regulated by the odd numbers[381].\r\nThe sun sometimes increases and sometimes restrains winds; when\r\nrising and setting it increases them; while, when on the meridian, it\r\nrestrains them during the summer. They are, therefore, generally lulled\r\nduring the middle of the day and of the night, because they are abated\r\neither by excessive cold or heat; winds are also lulled by showers. We\r\ngenerally expect them to come from that quarter where the clouds open\r\nand allow the clear sky to be seen. Eudoxus[382] supposes that the same\r\nsuccession of changes occurs in them after a period of four years,\r\nif we observe their minute revolutions; and this applies not only to\r\nwinds, but to whatever concerns the state of the weather. He begins his\r\nlustrum at the rising of the dog-star, in the intercalary year. So far\r\nconcerning winds in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49. (48.)—ECNEPHIAS AND TYPHON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now respecting the sudden gusts[383], which arising from the\r\nexhalations of the earth, as has been said above, and falling down\r\nagain, being in the mean time covered by a thin film of clouds, exist\r\nin a variety of forms. By their wandering about, and rushing down\r\nlike torrents, in the opinion of some persons, they produce thunder\r\nand lightning[384]. But if they be urged on with greater force and\r\nviolence, so as to cause the rupture of a dry cloud, they produce a\r\nsquall[385], which is named by the Greeks Ecnephias[386]. But, if these\r\nare compressed, and rolled up more closely together, and then break\r\nwithout any discharge of fire, i. e. without thunder, they produce\r\na squall, which is named Typhon[387], or an Ecnephias in a state of\r\nagitation. It carries along a portion of the cloud which it has broken\r\noff, rolling it and turning it round, aggravating its own destruction\r\nby the weight of it, and whirling it from place to place. This is very\r\nmuch dreaded by sailors, as it not only breaks their sail-yards, but\r\nthe vessels themselves, bending them about in various ways. This may\r\nbe in a slight degree counteracted by sprinkling it with vinegar, when\r\nit comes near us, this substance being of a very cold nature[388].\r\nThis wind, when it rebounds after the stroke, absorbs and carries up\r\nwhatever it may have seized on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50.—TORNADOES; BLASTING WINDS; WHIRLWINDS[389], AND OTHER\r\nWONDERFUL KINDS OF TEMPESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if it burst from the cavity of a cloud which is more depressed,\r\nbut less capacious than what produces a squall, and is accompanied\r\nby noise, it is called a whirlwind, and throws down everything which\r\nis near it. The same, when it is more burning and rages with greater\r\nheat, is called a blasting wind[390], scorching and, at the same time,\r\nthrowing down everything with which it comes in contact. (49.) Typhon\r\nnever comes from the north, nor have we Ecnephias when it snows, or\r\nwhen there is snow on the ground. If it breaks the clouds, and, at the\r\nsame time, catches fire or burns, but not until it has left the cloud,\r\nit forms a thunder-bolt. It differs from Prester as flame does from\r\nfire; the former is diffused in a gust, the latter is condensed with a\r\nviolent impulse[391]. The whirlwind, when it rebounds, differs from the\r\ntornado in the same manner as a loud noise does from a dash.\r\n\r\nThe squall differs from both of them in its extent, the clouds being\r\nmore properly rent asunder than broken into pieces. A black cloud\r\nis formed, resembling a great animal, an appearance much dreaded by\r\nsailors. It is also called a pillar, when the moisture is so condensed\r\nand rigid as to be able to support itself. It is a cloud of the same\r\nkind, which, when drawn into a tube, sucks up the water[392].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51. (50.)—OF THUNDER[393]; IN WHAT COUNTRIES IT DOES NOT FALL,\r\nAND FOR WHAT REASON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThunder is rare both in winter and in summer[394], but from different\r\ncauses; the air, which is condensed in the winter, is made still more\r\ndense by a thicker covering of clouds, while the exhalations from the\r\nearth, being all of them rigid and frozen, extinguish whatever fiery\r\nvapour it may receive. It is this cause which exempts Scythia and the\r\ncold districts round it from thunder. On the other hand, the excessive\r\nheat exempts Egypt; the warm and dry vapours of the earth being very\r\nseldom condensed, and that only into light clouds. But, in the spring\r\nand autumn, thunder is more frequent, the causes which produce summer\r\nand winter being, in each season, less efficient. From this cause\r\nthunder is more frequent in Italy, the air being more easily set in\r\nmotion, in consequence of a milder winter and a showery summer, so that\r\nit may be said to be always spring or autumn. Also in those parts of\r\nItaly which recede from the north and lie towards the south, as in the\r\ndistrict round our city, and in Campania, it lightens equally both in\r\nwinter and in summer, which is not the case in other situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52. (51.)—OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LIGHTNING[395] AND THEIR\r\nWONDERFUL EFFECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have accounts of many different kinds of thunder-storms. Those which\r\nare dry do not burn objects, but dissipate them; while those which\r\nare moist do not burn, but blacken them. There is a third kind, which\r\nis called bright lightning[396], of a very wonderful nature, by which\r\ncasks are emptied, without the vessels themselves being injured, or\r\nthere being any other trace left of their operation[397]. Gold, copper,\r\nand silver are melted, while the bags which contain them are not in the\r\nleast burned, nor even the wax seal much defaced. Marcia, a lady of\r\nhigh rank at Rome, was struck while pregnant; the fœtus was destroyed,\r\nwhile she herself survived without suffering any injury[398]. Among\r\nthe prognostics which took place at the time of Catiline’s conspiracy,\r\nM. Herennius, a magistrate of the borough of Pompeii, was struck by\r\nlightning when the sky was without clouds[399].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53. (52.)—THE ETRURIAN[400] AND THE ROMAN OBSERVATIONS ON THESE\r\nPOINTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tuscan books inform us, that there are nine Gods who discharge\r\nthunder-storms, that there are eleven different kinds of them, and that\r\nthree of them are darted out by Jupiter. Of these the Romans retained\r\nonly two, ascribing the diurnal kind to Jupiter, and the nocturnal\r\nto Summanus[401]; this latter kind being more rare, in consequence\r\nof the heavens being colder, as was mentioned above. The Etrurians\r\nalso suppose, that those which are named Infernal burst out of the\r\nground; they are produced in the winter and are particularly fierce and\r\ndireful, as all things are which proceed from the earth, and are not\r\ngenerated by or proceeding from the stars, but from a cause which is\r\nnear at hand, and of a more disorderly nature. As a proof of this it\r\nis said, that all those which proceed from the higher regions strike\r\nobliquely, while those which are termed terrestrial strike in a direct\r\nline. And because these fall from matter which is nearer to us, they\r\nare supposed to proceed from the earth, since they leave no traces of a\r\nrebound; this being the effect of a stroke coming not from below, but\r\nfrom an opposite quarter. Those who have searched into the subject\r\nmore minutely suppose, that these come from the planet Saturn, as\r\nthose that are of a burning nature do from Mars. In this way it was\r\nthat Volsinium, the most opulent town of the Tuscans, was entirely\r\nconsumed by lightning[402]. The first of these strokes that a man\r\nreceives, after he has come into possession of any property, is termed\r\n_Familiar_[403], and is supposed to prognosticate the events of the\r\nwhole of his life. But it is not generally supposed that they predict\r\nevents of a private nature for a longer space than ten years, unless\r\nthey happen at the time of a first marriage or a birth-day; nor that\r\npublic predictions extend beyond thirty years[404], unless with respect\r\nto the founding of colonies[405].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54. (53.)—OF CONJURING UP THUNDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is related in our Annals, that by certain sacred rites and\r\nimprecations, thunder-storms may be compelled or invoked[406]. There\r\nis an old report in Etruria, that thunder was invoked when the city of\r\nVolsinium had its territory laid waste by a monster named Volta[407].\r\nThunder was also invoked by King Porsenna. And L. Piso[408], a very\r\nrespectable author, states in the first book of his Annals, that this\r\nhad been frequently done before his time by Numa, and that Tullus\r\nHostilius, imitating him, but not having properly performed the\r\nceremonies, was struck with the lightning[409]. We have also groves,\r\nand altars, and sacred places, and, among the titles of Jupiter, as\r\nStator, Tonans, and Feretrius, we have a Jupiter Elicius[410]. The\r\nopinions entertained on this point are very various, and depend much\r\non the dispositions of different individuals. To believe that we can\r\ncommand nature is the mark of a bold mind, nor is it less the mark of a\r\nfeeble one to reject her kindness[411]. Our knowledge has been so far\r\nuseful to us in the interpretation of thunder, that it enables us to\r\npredict what is to happen on a certain day, and we learn either that\r\nour fortune is to be entirely changed, or it discloses events which\r\nare concealed from us; as is proved by an infinite number of examples,\r\npublic and private. Wherefore let these things remain, according to\r\nthe order of nature, to some persons certain, to others doubtful, by\r\nsome approved, by others condemned. I must not, however, omit the other\r\ncircumstances connected with them which deserve to be related.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55. (54.)—GENERAL LAWS OF LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the lightning is seen before the thunder is heard,\r\nalthough they both take place at the same time. Nor is this wonderful,\r\nsince light has a greater velocity than sound. Nature so regulates it,\r\nthat the stroke and the sound coincide[412]; the sound is, however,\r\nproduced by the discharge of the thunder, not by its stroke. But the\r\nair is impelled quicker than the lightning[413], on which account it\r\nis that everything is shaken and blown up before it is struck, and that\r\na person is never injured when he has seen the lightning and heard the\r\nthunder. Thunder on the left hand is supposed to be lucky, because\r\nthe east is on the left side of the heavens[414]. We do not regard so\r\nmuch the mode in which it comes to us, as that in which it leaves us,\r\nwhether the fire rebounds after the stroke, or whether the current of\r\nair returns when the operation is concluded and the fire is consumed.\r\nIn relation to this object the Etrurians have divided the heavens into\r\nsixteen parts[415]. The first great division is from north to east; the\r\nsecond to the south; the third to the west, and the fourth occupies\r\nwhat remains from west to north. Each of these has been subdivided\r\ninto four parts, of which the eight on the east have been called the\r\nleft, and those on the west the right divisions. Those which extend\r\nfrom the west to the north have been considered the most unpropitious.\r\nIt becomes therefore very important to ascertain from what quarter the\r\nthunder proceeds, and in what direction it falls. It is considered a\r\nvery favourable omen when it returns into the eastern divisions. But\r\nit prognosticates the greatest felicity when the thunder proceeds from\r\nthe first-mentioned part of the heavens and falls back into it; it was\r\nan omen of this kind which, as we have heard, was given to Sylla, the\r\nDictator. The remaining quarters of the heavens are less propitious,\r\nand also less to be dreaded. There are some kinds of thunder which it\r\nis not thought right to speak of, or even to listen to, unless when\r\nthey have been disclosed to the master of a family or to a parent.\r\nBut the futility of this observation was detected when the temple of\r\nJuno was struck at Rome, during the consulship of Scaurus, he who was\r\nafterwards the Prince of the Senate[416].\r\n\r\nIt lightens without thunder more frequently in the night than in the\r\nday[417]. Man is the only animal that is not always killed by it, all\r\nother animals being killed instantly, nature having granted to him\r\nthis mark of distinction, while so many other animals excel him in\r\nstrength. All animals fall down on the opposite side to that which\r\nhas been struck; man, unless he be thrown down on the parts that are\r\nstruck, does not expire. Those who are struck directly from above sink\r\ndown immediately. When a man is struck while he is awake, he is found\r\nwith his eyes closed; when asleep, with them open. It is not considered\r\nproper that a man killed in this way should be burnt on the funeral\r\npile; our religion enjoins us to bury the body in the earth[418]. No\r\nanimal is consumed by lightning unless after having been previously\r\nkilled. The parts of the animal that have been wounded by lightning are\r\ncolder than the rest of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56. (55.)—OBJECTS WHICH ARE NEVER STRUCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the productions of the earth, thunder never strikes the\r\nlaurel[419], nor does it descend more than five feet into the earth.\r\nThose, therefore, who are timid consider the deepest caves as the most\r\nsafe; or tents made of the skins of the animal called the sea-calf,\r\nsince this is the only marine animal which is never struck[420];\r\nas is the case, among birds, with the eagle; on this account it is\r\nrepresented as the bearer of this weapon[421]. In Italy, between\r\nTerracina and the temple of Feronia, the people have left off building\r\ntowers in time of war, every one of them having been destroyed by\r\nthunderbolts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 57. (56.)—SHOWERS OF MILK, BLOOD, FLESH, IRON, WOOL, AND BAKED\r\nTILES[422].\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides these, we learn from certain monuments, that from the lower\r\npart of the atmosphere[423] it rained milk and blood, in the consulship\r\nof M’ Acilius and C. Porcius, and frequently at other times[424]. This\r\nwas the case with respect to flesh, in the consulship of P. Volumnius\r\nand Servius Sulpicius, and it is said, that what was not devoured\r\nby the birds did not become putrid. It also rained iron among the\r\nLucanians, the year before Crassus was slain by the Parthians, as\r\nwell as all the Lucanian soldiers, of whom there was a great number\r\nin this army. The substance which fell had very much the appearance\r\nof sponge[425]; the augurs warned the people against wounds that\r\nmight come from above. In the consulship of L. Paulus and C. Marcellus\r\nit rained wool, round the castle of Carissanum, near which place,\r\na year after, T. Annius Milo was killed. It is recorded, among the\r\ntransactions of that year, that when he was pleading his own cause,\r\nthere was a shower of baked tiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 58. (57.)—RATTLING OF ARMS AND THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS HEARD IN THE\r\nSKY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have heard, that during the war with the Cimbri, the rattling of\r\narms and the sound of trumpets were heard through the sky, and that the\r\nsame thing has frequently happened before and since[426]. Also, that in\r\nthe third consulship of Marius, armies were seen in the heavens by the\r\nAmerini and the Tudertes, encountering each other, as if from the east\r\nand west, and that those from the east were repelled[427]. It is not at\r\nall wonderful for the heavens themselves to be in flames[428], and it\r\nhas been more frequently observed when the clouds have taken up a great\r\ndeal of fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 59. (58.)—OF STONES THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE CLOUDS[429]. THE\r\nOPINION OF ANAXAGORAS RESPECTING THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greeks boast that Anaxagoras[430], the Clazomenian, in the second\r\nyear of the 78th Olympiad, from his knowledge of what relates to the\r\nheavens, had predicted, that at a certain time, a stone would fall\r\nfrom the sun[431]. And the thing accordingly happened, in the daytime,\r\nin a part of Thrace, at the river Ægos. The stone is now to be seen, a\r\nwaggon-load in size and of a burnt appearance; there was also a comet\r\nshining in the night at that time[432]. But to believe that this had\r\nbeen predicted would be to admit that the divining powers of Anaxagoras\r\nwere still more wonderful, and that our knowledge of the nature of\r\nthings, and indeed every thing else, would be thrown into confusion,\r\nwere we to suppose either that the sun is itself composed of stone,\r\nor that there was even a stone in it; yet there can be no doubt that\r\nstones have frequently fallen from the atmosphere. There is a stone,\r\na small one indeed, at this time, in the Gymnasium of Abydos, which\r\non this account is held in veneration, and which the same Anaxagoras\r\npredicted would fall in the middle of the earth. There is another at\r\nCassandria, formerly called Potidæa[433], which from this circumstance\r\nwas built in that place. I have myself seen one in the country of the\r\nVocontii[434], which had been brought from the fields only a short time\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 60. (59.)—THE RAINBOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we name Rainbows frequently occur,\r\nand are not considered either wonderful or ominous; for they do not\r\npredict, with certainty, either rain or fair weather. It is obvious,\r\nthat the rays of the sun, being projected upon a hollow cloud, the\r\nlight is thrown back to the sun and is refracted[435], and that the\r\nvariety of colours is produced by a mixture of clouds, air, and\r\nfire[436]. The rainbow is certainly never produced except in the\r\npart opposite to the sun, nor even in any other form except that of\r\na semicircle. Nor are they ever formed at night, although Aristotle\r\nasserts that they are sometimes seen at that time; he acknowledges,\r\nhowever, that it can only be on the 14th day of the moon[437]. They are\r\nseen in the winter the most frequently, when the days are shortening,\r\nafter the autumnal equinox[438]. They are not seen when the days\r\nincrease again, after the vernal equinox, nor on the longest days,\r\nabout the summer solstice, but frequently at the winter solstice, when\r\nthe days are the shortest. When the sun is low they are high, and when\r\nthe sun is high they are low; they are smaller when in the east or\r\nwest, but are spread out wider; in the south they are small, but of a\r\ngreater span. In the summer they are not seen at noon, but after the\r\nautumnal equinox at any hour: there are never more than two seen at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 61.—THE NATURE OF HAIL, SNOW, HOAR, MIST, DEW; THE FORMS OF\r\nCLOUDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not find that there is any doubt entertained respecting the\r\nfollowing points. (60.) Hail is produced by frozen rain, and snow by\r\nthe same fluid less firmly concreted, and hoar by frozen dew[439].\r\nDuring the winter snow falls, but not hail; hail itself falls more\r\nfrequently during the day than the night, and is more quickly melted\r\nthan snow. There are no mists either in the summer or during the\r\ngreatest cold of winter. There is neither dew nor hoar formed during\r\ngreat heat or winds, nor unless the night be serene. Fluids are\r\ndiminished in bulk by being frozen, and, when the ice is melted, we do\r\nnot obtain the same quantity of fluid as at first[440].\r\n\r\n(61.) The clouds are varied in their colour and figure according as the\r\nfire which they contain is in excess or is absorbed by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 62. (62.)—THE PECULIARITIES OF THE WEATHER IN DIFFERENT PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, certain peculiarities in certain places. In Africa\r\ndew falls during the night in summer. In Italy, at Locri, and at the\r\nLake Velinum, there is never a day in which a rainbow is not seen[441].\r\nAt Rhodes and at Syracuse the sky is never so covered with clouds, but\r\nthat the sun is visible at one time or another; these things, however,\r\nwill be better detailed in their proper place. So far respecting the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 63. (63.)—NATURE OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext comes the earth, on which alone of all parts of nature we have\r\nbestowed the name that implies maternal veneration. It is appropriated\r\nto man as the heavens are to God. She receives us at our birth,\r\nnourishes us when born, and ever afterwards supports us; lastly,\r\nembracing us in her bosom when we are rejected by the rest of nature,\r\nshe then covers us with especial tenderness; rendered sacred to us,\r\ninasmuch as she renders us sacred, bearing our monuments and titles,\r\ncontinuing our names, and extending our memory, in opposition to the\r\nshortness of life. In our anger we imprecate her on those who are now\r\nno more[442], as if we were ignorant that she is the only being who can\r\nnever be angry with man. The water passes into showers, is concreted\r\ninto hail, swells into rivers, is precipitated in torrents; the air is\r\ncondensed into clouds, rages in squalls; but the earth, kind, mild, and\r\nindulgent as she is, and always ministering to the wants of mortals,\r\nhow many things do we compel her to produce spontaneously! What odours\r\nand flowers, nutritive juices, forms and colours! With what good faith\r\ndoes she render back all that has been entrusted to her! It is the\r\nvital spirit which must bear the blame of producing noxious animals;\r\nfor the earth is constrained to receive the seeds of them, and to\r\nsupport them when they are produced. The fault lies in the evil nature\r\nwhich generates them. The earth will no longer harbour a serpent after\r\nit has attacked any one[443], and thus she even demands punishment in\r\nthe name of those who are indifferent about it themselves[444]. She\r\npours forth a profusion of medicinal plants, and is always producing\r\nsomething for the use of man. We may even suppose, that it is out\r\nof compassion to us that she has ordained certain substances to be\r\npoisonous, in order that when we are weary of life, hunger, a mode of\r\ndeath the most foreign to the kind disposition of the earth[445], might\r\nnot consume us by a slow decay, that precipices might not lacerate\r\nour mangled bodies, that the unseemly punishment of the halter may\r\nnot torture us, by stopping the breath of one who seeks his own\r\ndestruction, or that we may not seek our death in the ocean, and become\r\nfood for our graves, or that our bodies may not be gashed by steel. On\r\nthis account it is that nature has produced a substance which is very\r\neasily taken, and by which life is extinguished, the body remaining\r\nundefiled and retaining all its blood, and only causing a degree of\r\nthirst. And when it is destroyed by this means, neither bird nor beast\r\nwill touch the body, but he who has perished by his own hands is\r\nreserved for the earth.\r\n\r\nBut it must be acknowledged, that everything which the earth has\r\nproduced, as a remedy for our evils, we have converted into the poison\r\nof our lives. For do we not use iron, which we cannot do without, for\r\nthis purpose? But although this cause of mischief has been produced,\r\nwe ought not to complain; we ought not to be ungrateful to this one\r\npart of nature[446]. How many luxuries and how many insults does she\r\nnot bear for us! She is cast into the sea, and, in order that we may\r\nintroduce seas into her bosom, she is washed away by the waves. She\r\nis continually tortured for her iron, her timber, stone, fire, corn,\r\nand is even much more subservient to our luxuries than to our mere\r\nsupport. What indeed she endures on her surface might be tolerated,\r\nbut we penetrate also into her bowels, digging out the veins of gold\r\nand silver, and the ores of copper and lead; we also search for gems\r\nand certain small pebbles, driving our trenches to a great depth. We\r\ntear out her entrails in order to extract the gems with which we may\r\nload our fingers. How many hands are worn down that one little joint\r\nmay be ornamented! If the infernal regions really existed, certainly\r\nthese burrows of avarice and luxury would have penetrated into them.\r\nAnd truly we wonder that this same earth should have produced anything\r\nnoxious! But, I suppose, the savage beasts protect her and keep off\r\nour sacrilegious hands[447]. For do we not dig among serpents and\r\nhandle poisonous plants along with those veins of gold? But the Goddess\r\nshows herself more propitious to us, inasmuch as all this wealth ends\r\nin crimes, slaughter, and war, and that, while we drench her with\r\nour blood, we cover her with unburied bones; and being covered with\r\nthese and her anger being thus appeased, she conceals the crimes of\r\nmortals[448]. I consider the ignorance of her nature as one of the evil\r\neffects of an ungrateful mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 64. (64.)—OF THE FORM OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one agrees that it has the most perfect figure[449]. We always\r\nspeak of the ball of the earth, and we admit it to be a globe bounded\r\nby the poles. It has not indeed the form of an absolute sphere, from\r\nthe number of lofty mountains and flat plains; but if the termination\r\nof the lines be bounded by a curve[450], this would compose a perfect\r\nsphere. And this we learn from arguments drawn from the nature of\r\nthings, although not from the same considerations which we made use\r\nof with respect to the heavens. For in these the hollow convexity\r\neverywhere bends on itself, and leans upon the earth as its centre.\r\nWhereas the earth rises up solid and dense, like something that\r\nswells up and is protruded outwards. The heavens bend towards the\r\ncentre, while the earth goes from the centre, the continual rolling\r\nof the heavens about it forcing its immense globe into the form of a\r\nsphere[451].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 65. (65.)—WHETHER THERE BE ANTIPODES?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this point there is a great contest between the learned and the\r\nvulgar. We maintain, that there are men dispersed over every part of\r\nthe earth, that they stand with their feet turned towards each other,\r\nthat the vault of the heavens appears alike to all of them, and that\r\nthey, all of them, appear to tread equally on the middle of the earth.\r\nIf any one should ask, why those situated opposite to us do not fall,\r\nwe directly ask in return, whether those on the opposite side do not\r\nwonder that we do not fall. But I may make a remark, that will appear\r\nplausible even to the most unlearned, that if the earth were of the\r\nfigure of an unequal globe, like the seed of a pine[452], still it may\r\nbe inhabited in every part.\r\n\r\nBut of how little moment is this, when we have another miracle rising\r\nup to our notice! The earth itself is pendent and does not fall with\r\nus; it is doubtful whether this be from the force of the spirit which\r\nis contained in the universe[453], or whether it would fall, did not\r\nnature resist, by allowing of no place where it might fall. For as the\r\nseat of fire is nowhere but in fire, nor of water except in water, nor\r\nof air except in air, so there is no situation for the earth except in\r\nitself, everything else repelling it. It is indeed wonderful that it\r\nshould form a globe, when there is so much flat surface of the sea and\r\nof the plains. And this was the opinion of Dicæarchus, a peculiarly\r\nlearned man, who measured the heights of mountains, under the direction\r\nof the kings, and estimated Pelion, which was the highest, at 1250\r\npaces perpendicular, and considered this as not affecting the round\r\nfigure of the globe. But this appears to me to be doubtful, as I well\r\nknow that the summits of some of the Alps rise up by a long space of\r\nnot less than 50,000 paces[454]. But what the vulgar most strenuously\r\ncontend against is, to be compelled to believe that the water is\r\nforced into a rounded figure[455]; yet there is nothing more obvious\r\nto the sight among the phænomena of nature. For we see everywhere,\r\nthat drops, when they hang down, assume the form of small globes, and\r\nwhen they are covered with dust, or have the down of leaves spread\r\nover them, they are observed to be completely round; and when a cup\r\nis filled, the liquid swells up in the middle. But on account of the\r\nsubtile nature of the fluid and its inherent softness, the fact is more\r\neasily ascertained by our reason than by our sight. And it is even more\r\nwonderful, that if a very little fluid only be added to a cup when\r\nit is full, the superfluous quantity runs over, whereas the contrary\r\nhappens if we add a solid body, even as much as would weigh 20 denarii.\r\nThe reason of this is, that what is dropt in raises up the fluid at the\r\ntop, while what is poured on it slides off from the projecting surface.\r\nIt is from the same cause[456] that the land is not visible from the\r\nbody of a ship when it may be seen from the mast; and that when a\r\nvessel is receding, if any bright object be fixed to the mast, it seems\r\ngradually to descend and finally to become invisible. And the ocean,\r\nwhich we admit to be without limits, if it had any other figure, could\r\nit cohere and exist without falling, there being no external margin\r\nto contain it? And the same wonder still recurs, how is it that the\r\nextreme parts of the sea, although it be in the form of a globe, do not\r\nfall down? In opposition to which doctrine, the Greeks, to their great\r\njoy and glory, were the first to teach us, by their subtile geometry,\r\nthat this could not happen, even if the seas were flat, and of the\r\nfigure which they appear to be. For since water always runs from a\r\nhigher to a lower level, and this is admitted to be essential to it,\r\nno one ever doubted that the water would accumulate on any shore, as\r\nmuch as its slope would allow it. It is also certain, that the lower\r\nanything is, so much the nearer is it to the centre, and that all the\r\nlines which are drawn from this point to the water which is the nearest\r\nto it, are shorter than those which reach from the beginning of the\r\nsea to its extreme parts[457]. Hence it follows, that all the water,\r\nfrom every part, tends towards the centre, and, because it has this\r\ntendency, does not fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 66.—HOW THE WATER IS CONNECTED WITH THE EARTH. OF THE NAVIGATION\r\nOF THE SEA AND THE RIVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must believe, that the great artist, Nature, has so arranged it,\r\nthat as the arid and dry earth cannot subsist by itself and without\r\nmoisture, nor, on the other hand, can the water subsist unless it be\r\nsupported by the earth, they are connected by a mutual union. The\r\nearth opens her harbours, while the water pervades the whole earth,\r\nwithin, without, and above; its veins running in all directions, like\r\nconnecting links, and bursting out on even the highest ridges; where,\r\nforced up by the air, and pressed out by the weight of the earth, it\r\nshoots forth as from a pipe, and is so far from being in danger of\r\nfalling, that it bounds up to the highest and most lofty places. Hence\r\nthe reason is obvious, why the seas are not increased by the daily\r\naccession of so many rivers[458].\r\n\r\n(66.) The earth has, therefore, the whole of its globe girt, on every\r\nside, by the sea flowing round it. And this is not a point to be\r\ninvestigated by arguments, but what has been ascertained by experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 67. (67.)—WHETHER THE OCEAN SURROUNDS THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole of the western ocean is now navigated, from Gades and the\r\nPillars of Hercules, round Spain and Gaul. The greater part of the\r\nnorthern ocean has also been navigated, under the auspices of the\r\nEmperor Augustus, his fleet having been carried round Germany to\r\nthe promontory of the Cimbri[459]; from which spot they descried an\r\nimmense sea, or became acquainted with it by report, which extends to\r\nthe country of the Scythians, and the districts that are chilled by\r\nexcessive moisture[460]. On this account it is not at all probable,\r\nthat the ocean should be deficient in a region where moisture so much\r\nabounds. In like manner, towards the east, from the Indian sea, all\r\nthat part which lies in the same latitude[461], and which bends round\r\ntowards the Caspian[462], has been explored by the Macedonian arms,\r\nin the reigns of Seleucus and Antiochus, who wished it to be named\r\nafter themselves, the Seleucian or Antiochian Sea. About the Caspian,\r\ntoo, many parts of the shores of the ocean have been explored, so that\r\nnearly the whole of the north has been sailed over in one direction or\r\nanother. Nor can our argument be much affected by the point that has\r\nbeen so much discussed, respecting the Palus Mæotis, whether it be a\r\nbay of the same ocean[463], as is, I understand, the opinion of some\r\npersons, or whether it be the overflowing of a narrow channel connected\r\nwith a different ocean[464]. On the other side of Gades, proceeding\r\nfrom the same western point, a great part of the southern ocean,\r\nalong Mauritania, has now been navigated. Indeed the greater part of\r\nthis region, as well as of the east, as far as the Arabian Gulf, was\r\nsurveyed in consequence of Alexander’s victories. When Caius Cæsar,\r\nthe son of Augustus[465], had the conduct of affairs in that country,\r\nit is said that they found the remains of Spanish vessels which had\r\nbeen wrecked there. While the power of Carthage was at its height,\r\nHanno published an account of a voyage which he made from Gades to the\r\nextremity of Arabia[466]; Himilco was also sent, about the same time,\r\nto explore the remote parts of Europe. Besides, we learn from Corn.\r\nNepos, that one Eudoxus, a contemporary of his[467], when he was flying\r\nfrom king Lathyrus, set out from the Arabian Gulf, and was carried as\r\nfar as Gades[468]. And long before him, Cælius Antipater[469] informs\r\nus, that he had seen a person who had sailed from Spain to Æthiopia\r\nfor the purposes of trade. The same Cornelius Nepos, when speaking\r\nof the northern circumnavigation, tells us that Q. Metellus Celer,\r\nthe colleague of L. Afranius in the consulship, but then a proconsul\r\nin Gaul[470], had a present made to him by the king of the Suevi, of\r\ncertain Indians, who sailing from India for the purpose of commerce,\r\nhad been driven by tempests into Germany[471]. Thus it appears, that\r\nthe seas which flow completely round the globe, and divide it, as it\r\nwere, into two parts[472], exclude us from one part of it, as there is\r\nno way open to it on either side. And as the contemplation of these\r\nthings is adapted to detect the vanity of mortals, it seems incumbent\r\non me to display, and lay open to our eyes, the whole of it, whatever\r\nit be, in which there is nothing which can satisfy the desires of\r\ncertain individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 68. (68.)—WHAT PART OF THE EARTH IS INHABITED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, it appears, that this should be estimated at\r\nhalf the globe[473], as if no portion of this half was encroached upon\r\nby the ocean. But surrounding as it does the whole of the land, pouring\r\nout and receiving all the other waters, furnishing whatever goes to the\r\nclouds, and feeding the stars themselves, so numerous and of such great\r\nsize as they are, what a great space must we not suppose it to occupy!\r\nThis vast mass must fill up and occupy an infinite extent. To this we\r\nmust add that portion of the remainder which the heavens[474] take from\r\nus. For the globe is divided into five parts[475], termed zones, and\r\nall that portion is subject to severe cold and perpetual frost which is\r\nunder the two extremities, about each of the poles, the nearer of which\r\nis called the north, and the opposite the south, pole. In all these\r\nregions there is perpetual darkness, and, in consequence of the aspect\r\nof the milder stars being turned from them, the light is malignant, and\r\nonly like the whiteness which is produced by hoar frost. The middle of\r\nthe earth, over which is the orbit of the sun, is parched and burned\r\nby the flame, and is consumed by being so near the heat. There are\r\nonly two of the zones which are temperate, those which lie between\r\nthe torrid and the frigid zones, and these are separated from each\r\nother, in consequence of the scorching heat of the heavenly bodies. It\r\nappears, therefore, that the heavens take from us three parts of the\r\nearth; how much the ocean steals is uncertain.\r\n\r\nAnd with respect to the part which is left us, I do not know whether\r\nthat is not even in greater danger. This same ocean, insinuating\r\nitself, as I have described it, into a number of bays, approaches with\r\nits roaring[476] so near to the inland seas, that the Arabian Gulf is\r\nno more than 115 miles from the Egyptian Sea[477], and the Caspian\r\nonly 375 miles from the Euxine. It also insinuates itself into the\r\nnumerous seas by which it separates Africa, Europe, and Asia; hence how\r\nmuch space must it occupy? We must also take into account the extent\r\nof all the rivers and the marshes, and we must add the lakes and the\r\npools. There are also the mountains, raised up to the heavens, with\r\ntheir precipitous fronts; we must also subtract the forests and the\r\ncraggy valleys, the wildernesses, and the places, which, from various\r\ncauses, are desert. The vast quantity which remains of the earth[478],\r\nor rather, as many persons have considered it, this speck of a\r\nworld[479] (for the earth is no more in regard to the universe), this\r\nis the object, the seat of our glory—here we bear our honours, here we\r\nexercise our power, here we covet wealth, here we mortals create our\r\ndisturbances, here we continually carry on our wars, aye, civil wars,\r\neven, and unpeople the earth by mutual slaughter. And not to dwell on\r\npublic feuds, entered into by nations against each other, here it is\r\nthat we drive away our neighbours, and enclose the land thus seized\r\nupon within our own fence[480]; and yet the man who has most extended\r\nhis boundary, and has expelled the inhabitants for ever so great a\r\ndistance, after all, what mighty portion of the earth is he master of?\r\nAnd even when his avarice has been the most completely satisfied, what\r\npart of it can he take with him into the grave?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 69. (69.)—THAT THE EARTH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident from undoubted arguments, that the earth is in the middle\r\nof the universe[481], but it is the most clearly proved by the equality\r\nof the days and the nights at the equinox[482]. It is demonstrated by\r\nthe quadrant[483], which affords the most decisive confirmation of the\r\nfact, that unless the earth was in the middle, the days and nights\r\ncould not be equal; for, at the time of the equinox, the rising and\r\nsetting of the sun are seen on the same line, and the rising of the\r\nsun, at the summer solstice, is on the same line with its setting at\r\nthe winter solstice; but this could not happen if the earth was not\r\nsituated in the centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 70. (70.)—OF THE OBLIQUITY OF THE ZONES[484].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three circles[485], which are connected with the above-mentioned\r\nzones, distinguish the inequalities of the seasons; these are, the\r\nsolstitial circle, which proceeds from the part of the Zodiac the\r\nhighest to us and approaching the nearest to the district of the north;\r\non the other side, the brumal, which is towards the south pole; and the\r\nequinoctial, which traverses the middle of the Zodiac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 71.—OF THE INEQUALITY OF CLIMATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cause of the other things which are worthy of our admiration\r\ndepends on the figure of the earth itself, which, together with all its\r\nwaters, is proved, by the same arguments, to be a globe. This certainly\r\nis the cause why the stars of the northern portion of the heavens\r\nnever set to us, and why, on the other hand, those in the south never\r\nrise, and again, why the latter can never be seen by the former, the\r\nglobe of the earth rising up and concealing them. The Northern Wain\r\nis never seen in Troglodytice[486], nor in Egypt, which borders on\r\nit[487]; nor can we, in Italy, see the star Canopus[488], or Berenice’s\r\nHair[489]; nor what, under the Emperor Augustus, was named Cæsar’s\r\nThrone, although they are, there[490], very brilliant stars. The curved\r\nform of the earth is so obvious, rising up like a ridge, that Canopus\r\nappears to a spectator at Alexandria to rise above the horizon almost\r\nthe quarter of a sign; the same star at Rhodes appears, as it were, to\r\ngraze along the earth, while in Pontus it is not seen at all; where the\r\nNorthern Wain appears considerably elevated. This same constellation\r\ncannot be seen at Rhodes, and still less at Alexandria. In Arabia, in\r\nthe month of November, it is concealed during the first watch of the\r\nnight, but may be seen during the second[491]; in Meroë it is seen,\r\nfor a short time, in the evening, at the solstice, and it is visible\r\nat day-break, for a few days before the rising of Arcturus[492].\r\nThese facts have been principally ascertained by the expeditions of\r\nnavigators; the sea appearing more elevated or depressed in certain\r\nparts[493]; the stars suddenly coming into view, and, as it were,\r\nemerging from the water, after having been concealed by the bulging out\r\nof the globe[494]. But the heavens do not, as some suppose, rise higher\r\nat one pole, otherwise[495] its stars would be seen from all parts\r\nof the world; they indeed are supposed to be higher by those who are\r\nnearest to them, but the stars are sunk below the horizon to those who\r\nare more remote. As this pole appears to be elevated to those who are\r\nbeneath it; so, when we have passed along the convexity of the earth,\r\nthose stars rise up, which appear elevated to the inhabitants of those\r\nother districts; all this, however, could not happen unless the earth\r\nhad the shape of a globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 72.—IN WHAT PLACES ECLIPSES ARE INVISIBLE, AND WHY THIS IS THE\r\nCASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHence it is that the inhabitants of the east do not see those eclipses\r\nof the sun or of the moon which occur in the evening, nor the\r\ninhabitants of the west those in the morning, while such as take place\r\nat noon are more frequently visible[496]. We are told, that at the time\r\nof the famous victory of Alexander the Great, at Arbela[497], the moon\r\nwas eclipsed at the second hour of the night, while, in Sicily, the\r\nmoon was rising at the same hour. The eclipse of the sun which occurred\r\nthe day before the calends of May, in the consulship of Vipstanus\r\nand Fonteius[498], not many years ago, was seen in Campania between\r\nthe seventh and eighth hour of the day; the general Corbulo informs\r\nus, that it was seen in Armenia, between the eleventh and twelfth\r\nhour[499]; thus the curve of the globe both reveals and conceals\r\ndifferent objects from the inhabitants of its different parts. If the\r\nearth had been flat, everything would have been seen at the same time,\r\nfrom every part of it, and the nights would not have been unequal;\r\nwhile the equal intervals of twelve hours, which are now observed only\r\nin the middle of the earth, would in that case have been the same\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 73. (71.)—WHAT REGULATES THE DAYLIGHT ON THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHence it is that there is not any one night and day the same, in all\r\nparts of the earth, at the same time; the intervention of the globe\r\nproducing night, and its turning round producing day[500]. This is\r\nknown by various observations. In Africa and in Spain it is made\r\nevident by the Towers of Hannibal[501], and in Asia by the beacons,\r\nwhich, in consequence of their dread of pirates, the people erected\r\nfor their protection; for it has been frequently observed, that the\r\nsignals, which were lighted at the sixth hour of the day, were seen at\r\nthe third hour of the night by those who were the most remote[502].\r\nPhilonides, a courier of the above-mentioned Alexander, went from\r\nSicyon to Elis, a distance of 1200 stadia, in nine hours, while he\r\nseldom returned until the third hour of the night, although the road\r\nwas down-hill[503]. The reason is, that, in going, he followed the\r\ncourse of the sun, while on his return, in the opposite direction, he\r\nmet the sun and left it behind him. For the same reason it is, that\r\nthose who sail to the west, even on the shortest day, compensate for\r\nthe difficulty of sailing in the night and go farther[504], because\r\nthey sail in the same direction with the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 74. (72.)—REMARKS ON DIALS, AS CONNECTED WITH THIS SUBJECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same dial-plates[505] cannot be used in all places, the shadow of\r\nthe sun being sensibly different at distances of 300, or at most of\r\n500 stadia[506]. Hence the shadow of the dial-pin, which is termed the\r\ngnomon, at noon and at the summer solstice, in Egypt, is a little more\r\nthan half the length of the gnomon itself. At the city of Rome it is\r\nonly 1/9 less than the gnomon, at Ancona not more than 1/35 less, while\r\nin the part of Italy which is called Venetia, at the same hour, the\r\nshadow is equal to the length of the gnomon[507].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 75. (73.)—WHEN AND WHERE THERE ARE NO SHADOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is likewise said, that in the town of Syene, which is 5000 stadia\r\nsouth of Alexandria[508], there is no shadow at noon, on the day of\r\nthe solstice; and that a well, which was sunk for the purpose of the\r\nexperiment, is illuminated by the sun in every part. Hence it appears\r\nthat the sun, in this place, is vertical, and Onesicritus informs us\r\nthat this is the case, about the same time, in India, at the river\r\nHypasis[509]. It is well known, that at Berenice, a city of the\r\nTroglodytæ, and 4820 stadia beyond that city, in the same country,\r\nat the town of Ptolemais, which was built on the Red Sea, when the\r\nelephant was first hunted, this same thing takes place for forty-five\r\ndays before the solstice and for an equal length of time after it,\r\nand that during these ninety days the shadows are turned towards the\r\nsouth[510]. Again, at Meroë, an island in the Nile and the metropolis\r\nof the Æthiopians, which is 5000 stadia[511] from Syene, there are no\r\nshadows at two periods of the year, viz. when the sun is in the 18th\r\ndegree of Taurus and in the 14th of Leo[512]. The Oretes, a people of\r\nIndia, have a mountain named Maleus[513], near which the shadows in\r\nsummer fall towards the south and in winter towards the north. The\r\nseven stars of the Great Bear are visible there for fifteen nights\r\nonly. In India also, in the celebrated sea-port Patale[514], the\r\nsun rises to the right hand and the shadows fall towards the south.\r\nWhile Alexander was staying there it was observed, that the seven\r\nnorthern stars were seen only during the early part of the night[515].\r\nOnesicritus, one of his generals, informs us in his work, that in those\r\nplaces in India where there are no shadows, the seven stars are not\r\nvisible[516]; these places, he says, are called “Ascia[517],” and the\r\npeople there do not reckon the time by hours[518].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 76. (74.)—-WHERE THIS TAKES PLACE TWICE IN THE YEAR AND WHERE THE\r\nSHADOWS FALL IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEratosthenes informs us, that in the whole of Troglodytice, for\r\ntwice forty-five days in the year, the shadows fall in the contrary\r\ndirection[519].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 77. (75.)—WHERE THE DAYS ARE THE LONGEST AND WHERE THE SHORTEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nHence it follows, that in consequence of the daylight increasing\r\nin various degrees, in Meroë the longest day consists of twelve\r\næquinoctial hours and eight parts of an hour[520], at Alexandria of\r\nfourteen hours, in Italy of fifteen, in Britain of seventeen; where\r\nthe degree of light, which exists in the night, very clearly proves,\r\nwhat the reason of the thing also obliges us to believe, that, during\r\nthe solstitial period, as the sun approaches to the pole of the world,\r\nand his orbit is contracted, the parts of the earth that lie below him\r\nhave a day of six months long, and a night of equal length when he is\r\nremoved to the south pole. Pytheas, of Marseilles[521], informs us,\r\nthat this is the case in the island of Thule[522], which is six days’\r\nsail from the north of Britain. Some persons also affirm that this is\r\nthe case in Mona, which is about 200 miles from Camelodunum[523], a\r\ntown of Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 78. (76.)—OF THE FIRST DIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnaximenes the Milesian, the disciple of Anaximander, of whom I have\r\nspoken above[524], discovered the theory of shadows and what is called\r\nthe art of dialling, and he was the first who exhibited at Lacedæmon\r\nthe dial which they call sciothericon[525].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 79. (77.)—OF THE MODE IN WHICH THE DAYS ARE COMPUTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe days have been computed by different people in different ways. The\r\nBabylonians reckoned from one sunrise to the next; the Athenians from\r\none sunset to the next; the Umbrians from noon to noon; the multitude,\r\nuniversally, from light to darkness; the Roman priests and those who\r\npresided over the civil day, also the Egyptians and Hipparchus, from\r\nmidnight to midnight[526]. It appears that the interval from one\r\nsunrise to the next is less near the solstices than near the equinoxes,\r\nbecause the position of the zodiac is more oblique about its middle\r\npart, and more straight near the solstice[527].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 80. (78.)—OF THE DIFFERENCE OF NATIONS AS DEPENDING ON THE NATURE\r\nOF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo these circumstances we must add those that are connected with\r\ncertain celestial causes. There can be no doubt, that the Æthiopians\r\nare scorched by their vicinity to the sun’s heat, and they are\r\nborn, like persons who have been burned, with the beard and hair\r\nfrizzled[528]; while, in the opposite and frozen parts of the earth,\r\nthere are nations with white skins and long light hair. The latter are\r\nsavage from the inclemency of the climate, while the former are dull\r\nfrom its variableness[529]. We learn, from the form of the legs, that\r\nin the one, the fluids, like vapour, are forced into the upper parts\r\nof the body, while in the other, being a gross humour, it is drawn\r\ndownwards into the lower parts[530]. In the cold regions savage beasts\r\nare produced, and in the others, various forms of animals, and many\r\nkinds of birds[531]. In both situations the body grows tall, in the one\r\ncase by the force of fire, and in the other by the nutritive moisture.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the earth there is a salutary mixture of the two, a\r\ntract fruitful in all things, the habits of the body holding a mean\r\nbetween the two, with a proper tempering of colours; the manners of\r\nthe people are gentle, the intellect clear[532], the genius fertile\r\nand capable of comprehending every part of nature. They have formed\r\nempires, which has never been done by the remote nations; yet these\r\nlatter have never been subjected by the former, being severed from\r\nthem and remaining solitary, from the effect produced on them by their\r\nsavage nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 81. (79.)—OF EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the doctrine of the Babylonians, earthquakes and clefts of\r\nthe earth, and occurrences of this kind, are supposed to be produced\r\nby the influence of the stars, especially of the three to which they\r\nascribe thunder[533]; and to be caused by the stars moving with the\r\nsun, or being in conjunction with it, and, more particularly, when\r\nthey are in the quartile aspect[534]. If we are to credit the report,\r\na most admirable and immortal spirit, as it were of a divine nature,\r\nshould be ascribed to Anaximander the Milesian, who, they say, warned\r\nthe Lacedæmonians to beware of their city and their houses[535]. For\r\nhe predicted that an earthquake was at hand, when both the whole of\r\ntheir city was destroyed and a large portion of Mount Taygetus, which\r\nprojected in the form of a ship, was broken off, and added farther\r\nruin to the previous destruction. Another prediction is ascribed to\r\nPherecydes, the master of Pythagoras, and this was divine; by a draught\r\nof water from a well, he foresaw and predicted that there would be an\r\nearthquake in that place[536]. And if these things be true, how nearly\r\ndo these individuals approach to the Deity, even during their lifetime!\r\nBut I leave every one to judge of these matters as he pleases. I\r\ncertainly conceive the winds to be the cause of earthquakes; for the\r\nearth never trembles except when the sea is quite calm, and when the\r\nheavens are so tranquil that the birds cannot maintain their flight,\r\nall the air which should support them being withdrawn[537]; nor does\r\nit ever happen until after great winds, the gust being pent up, as\r\nit were, in the fissures and concealed hollows. For the trembling of\r\nthe earth resembles thunder in the clouds; nor does the yawning of\r\nthe earth differ from the bursting of the lightning; the enclosed air\r\nstruggling and striving to escape[538].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 82. (80.)—OF CLEFTS OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earth is shaken in various ways, and wonderful effects are\r\nproduced[539]; in one place the walls of cities being thrown down, and\r\nin others swallowed up by a deep cleft[540]; sometimes great masses\r\nof earth are heaped up, and rivers forced out, sometimes even flame\r\nand hot springs[541], and at others the course of rivers is turned.\r\nA terrible noise precedes and accompanies the shock[542]; sometimes\r\na murmuring, like the lowing of cattle, or like human voices, or the\r\nclashing of arms. This depends on the substance which receives the\r\nsound, and the shape of the caverns or crevices through which it\r\nissues; it being more shrill from a narrow opening, more hoarse from\r\none that is curved, producing a loud reverberation from hard bodies,\r\na sound like a boiling fluid[543] from moist substances, fluctuating\r\nin stagnant water, and roaring when forced against solid bodies. There\r\nis, therefore, often the sound without any motion. Nor is it a simple\r\nmotion, but one that is tremulous and vibratory. The cleft sometimes\r\nremains, displaying what it has swallowed up; sometimes concealing it,\r\nthe mouth being closed and the soil being brought over it, so that no\r\nvestige is left; the city being, as it were, devoured, and the tract\r\nof country engulfed. Maritime districts are more especially subject to\r\nshocks. Nor are mountainous tracts exempt from them; I have found, by\r\nmy inquiries, that the Alps and the Apennines are frequently shaken.\r\nThe shocks happen more frequently in the autumn and in the spring, as\r\nis the case also with thunder. There are seldom shocks in Gaul and in\r\nEgypt; in the latter it depends on the prevalence of summer, in the\r\nformer, of winter. They also happen more frequently in the night than\r\nin the day. The greatest shocks are in the morning and the evening; but\r\nthey often take place at day-break, and sometimes at noon. They also\r\ntake place during eclipses of the sun and of the moon, because at that\r\ntime storms are lulled. They are most frequent when great heat succeeds\r\nto showers, or showers succeed to great heat[544].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 83. (81.)—SIGNS OF AN APPROACHING EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that earthquakes are felt by persons on shipboard, as\r\nthey are struck by a sudden motion of the waves, without these being\r\nraised by any gust of wind. And things that are in the vessels shake as\r\nthey do in houses, and give notice by their creaking; also the birds,\r\nwhen they settle upon the vessels, are not without their alarms. There\r\nis also a sign in the heavens; for, when a shock is near at hand,\r\neither in the daytime or a little after sunset, a cloud is stretched\r\nout in the clear sky, like a long thin line[545]. The water in wells is\r\nalso more turbid than usual, and it emits a disagreeable odour[546].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 84. (82.)—PRESERVATIVES AGAINST FUTURE EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese same places[547], however, afford protection, and this is also\r\nthe case where there is a number of caverns, for they give vent to the\r\nconfined vapour, a circumstance which has been remarked in certain\r\ntowns, which have been less shaken where they have been excavated by\r\nmany sewers. And, in the same town, those parts that are excavated[548]\r\nare safer than the other parts, as is understood to be the case at\r\nNaples in Italy, the part of it which is solid being more liable to\r\ninjury. Arched buildings are also the most safe, also the angles of\r\nwalls, the shocks counteracting each other; walls made of brick also\r\nsuffer less from the shocks[549]. There is also a great difference in\r\nthe nature of the motions[550], where various motions are experienced.\r\nIt is the safest when it vibrates and causes a creaking in the\r\nbuilding, and where it swells and rises upwards, and settles with\r\nan alternate motion. It is also harmless when the buildings coming\r\ntogether butt against each other in opposite directions, for the\r\nmotions counteract each other. A movement like the rolling of waves is\r\ndangerous, or when the motion is impelled in one direction. The tremors\r\ncease when the vapour bursts out[551]; but if they do not soon cease,\r\nthey continue for forty days; generally, indeed, for a longer time:\r\nsome have lasted even for one or two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 85. (83.)—PRODIGIES OF THE EARTH WHICH HAVE OCCURRED ONCE ONLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great prodigy of the earth, which never happened more than once, I\r\nhave found mentioned in the books of the Etruscan ceremonies, as having\r\ntaken place in the district of Mutina, during the consulship of Lucius\r\nMartius and Sextus Julius[552]. Two mountains rushed together, falling\r\nupon each other with a very loud crash, and then receding; while in\r\nthe daytime flame and smoke issued from them; a great crowd of Roman\r\nknights, and families of people, and travellers on the Æmilian way,\r\nbeing spectators of it. All the farm-houses were thrown down by the\r\nshock, and a great number of animals that were in them were killed;\r\nit was in the year before the Social war; and I am in doubt whether\r\nthis event or the civil commotions were more fatal to the territory of\r\nItaly. The prodigy which happened in our own age was no less wonderful;\r\nin the last year of the emperor Nero[553], as I have related in my\r\nhistory of his times[554], when certain fields and olive grounds in the\r\ndistrict of Marrucinum, belonging to Vectius Marcellus, a Roman knight,\r\nthe steward of Nero, changed places with each other[555], although the\r\npublic highway was interposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 86. (84.)—WONDERFUL CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nInundations of the sea take place at the same time with\r\nearthquakes[556]; the water being impregnated with the same\r\nspirit[557], and received into the bosom of the earth which subsides.\r\nThe greatest earthquake which has occurred in our memory was in the\r\nreign of Tiberius[558], by which twelve cities of Asia were laid\r\nprostrate in one night. They occurred the most frequently during\r\nthe Punic war, when we had accounts brought to Rome of fifty-seven\r\nearthquakes in the space of a single year. It was during this year[559]\r\nthat the Carthaginians and the Romans, who were fighting at the lake\r\nThrasimenus, were neither of them sensible of a very great shock during\r\nthe battle[560]. Nor is it an evil merely consisting in the danger\r\nwhich is produced by the motion; it is an equal or a greater evil when\r\nit is considered as a prodigy[561]. The city of Rome never experienced\r\na shock, which was not the forerunner of some great calamity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 87. (85.)—IN WHAT PLACES THE SEA HAS RECEDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same cause produces an increase of the land; the vapour, when it\r\ncannot burst out forcibly lifting up the surface[562]. For the land is\r\nnot merely produced by what is brought down the rivers, as the islands\r\ncalled Echinades are formed by the river Achelous, and the greater\r\npart of Egypt by the Nile, where, according to Homer, it was a day and\r\na night’s journey from the main land to the island of Pharos[563];\r\nbut, in some cases, by the receding of the sea, as, according to\r\nthe same author, was the case with the Circæan isles[564]. The same\r\nthing also happened in the harbour of Ambracia, for a space of 10,000\r\npaces, and was also said to have taken place for 5000 at the Piræus of\r\nAthens[565], and likewise at Ephesus, where formerly the sea washed the\r\nwalls of the temple of Diana. Indeed, if we may believe Herodotus[566],\r\nthe sea came beyond Memphis, as far as the mountains of Æthiopia, and\r\nalso from the plains of Arabia. The sea also surrounded Ilium and the\r\nwhole of Teuthrania, and covered the plain through which the Mæander\r\nflows[567].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 88. (86.)—THE MODE IN WHICH ISLANDS RISE UP.\r\n\r\n\r\nLand is sometimes formed in a different manner, rising suddenly out of\r\nthe sea, as if nature was compensating the earth for its losses[568],\r\nrestoring in one place what she had swallowed up in another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 89. (87.)—WHAT ISLANDS HAVE BEEN FORMED, AND AT WHAT PERIODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelos and Rhodes[569], islands which have now been long famous, are\r\nrecorded to have risen up in this way. More lately there have been some\r\nsmaller islands formed; Anapha, which is beyond Melos; Nea, between\r\nLemnos and the Hellespont; Halone, between Lebedos and Teos; Thera[570]\r\nand Therasia, among the Cyclades, in the fourth year of the 135th\r\nOlympiad[571]. And among the same islands, 130 years afterwards, Hiera,\r\nalso called Automate[572], made its appearance; also Thia, at the\r\ndistance of two stadia from the former, 110 years afterwards, in our\r\nown times, when M. Junius Silanus and L. Balbus were consuls, on the\r\n8th of the ides of July[573].\r\n\r\n(88.) Opposite to us, and near to Italy, among the Æolian isles, an\r\nisland emerged from the sea; and likewise one near Crete, 2500 paces\r\nin extent, and with warm springs in it; another made its appearance in\r\nthe third year of the 163rd Olympiad[574], in the Tuscan gulf, burning\r\nwith a violent explosion. There is a tradition too that a great number\r\nof fishes were floating about the spot, and that those who employed\r\nthem for food immediately expired. It is said that the Pithecusan isles\r\nrose up, in the same way, in the bay of Campania, and that, shortly\r\nafterwards, the mountain Epopos, from which flame had suddenly burst\r\nforth, was reduced to the level of the neighbouring plain. In the\r\nsame island, it is said, that a town was sunk in the sea; that in\r\nconsequence of another shock, a lake burst out, and that, by a third,\r\nProchytas was formed into an island, the neighbouring mountains being\r\nrolled away from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP 90.—LANDS WHICH HAVE BEEN SEPARATED BY THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary course of things islands are also formed by this means.\r\nThe sea has torn Sicily from Italy[575], Cyprus from Syria, Eubœa\r\nfrom Bœotia[576], Atalante and Macris[577] from Eubœa, Besbycus from\r\nBithynia, and Leucosia from the promontory of the Sirens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 91. (89.)—ISLANDS WHICH HAVE BEEN UNITED TO THE MAIN LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, islands are taken from the sea and added to the main land;\r\nAntissa[578] to Lesbos, Zephyrium to Halicarnassus, Æthusa to Myndus,\r\nDromiscus and Perne to Miletus, Narthecusa to the promontory of\r\nParthenium. Hybanda, which was formerly an island of Ionia, is now 200\r\nstadia distant from the sea. Syries is now become a part of Ephesus,\r\nand, in the same neighbourhood, Derasidas and Sophonia form part of\r\nMagnesia; while Epidaurus and Oricum are no longer islands[579].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 92. (90.)—LANDS WHICH HAVE BEEN TOTALLY CHANGED INTO SEAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea has totally carried off certain lands, and first of all, if\r\nwe are to believe Plato[580], for an immense space where the Atlantic\r\nocean is now extended. More lately we see what has been produced by\r\nour inland sea; Acarnania has been overwhelmed by the Ambracian gulf,\r\nAchaia by the Corinthian, Europe and Asia by the Propontis and Pontus.\r\nAnd besides these, the sea has rent asunder Leucas, Antirrhium, the\r\nHellespont, and the two Bosphori[581].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 93. (91.)—LANDS WHICH HAVE BEEN SWALLOWED UP.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd not to speak of bays and gulfs, the earth feeds on itself; it has\r\ndevoured the very high mountain of Cybotus, with the town of Curites;\r\nalso Sipylus in Magnesia[582], and formerly, in the same place, a very\r\ncelebrated city, which was called Tantalis; also the land belonging to\r\nthe cities Galanis and Gamales in Phœnicia, together with the cities\r\nthemselves; also Phegium, the most lofty ridge in Æthiopia[583]. Nor\r\nare the shores of the sea more to be depended upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 94. (92.)—CITIES WHICH HAVE BEEN ABSORBED BY THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea near the Palus Mæotis has carried away Pyrrha and Antissa,\r\nalso Elice and Bura[584] in the gulf of Corinth, traces of which\r\nplaces are visible in the ocean. From the island Cea it has seized on\r\n30,000 paces, which were suddenly torn off, with many persons on them.\r\nIn Sicily also the half of the city of Tyndaris, and all the part of\r\nItaly which is wanting[585]; in like manner it carried off Eleusina in\r\nBœotia[586].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 95. (93.)—OF VENTS[587] IN THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut let us say no more of earthquakes and of whatever may be regarded\r\nas the sepulchres of cities[588]; let us rather speak of the wonders of\r\nthe earth than of the crimes of nature. But, by Hercules! the history\r\nof the heavens themselves would not be more difficult to relate:—the\r\nabundance of metals, so various, so rich, so prolific, rising up[589]\r\nduring so many ages; when, throughout all the world, so much is,\r\nevery day, destroyed by fire, by waste, by shipwreck, by wars, and\r\nby frauds; and while so much is consumed by luxury and by such a\r\nnumber of people:—the figures on gems, so multiplied in their forms;\r\nthe variously-coloured spots on certain stones, and the whiteness of\r\nothers, excluding everything except light:—the virtues of medicinal\r\nsprings, and the perpetual fires bursting out in so many places, for\r\nso many ages:—the exhalation of deadly vapours, either emitted from\r\ncaverns[590], or from certain unhealthy districts; some of them fatal\r\nto birds alone, as at Soracte, a district near the city[591]; others\r\nto all animals, except to man[592], while others are so to man also,\r\nas in the country of Sinuessa and Puteoli. They are generally called\r\nvents, and, by some persons, Charon’s sewers, from their exhaling a\r\ndeadly vapour. Also at Amsanctum, in the country of the Hirpini, at the\r\ntemple of Mephitis[593], there is a place which kills all those who\r\nenter it. And the same takes place at Hierapolis in Asia[594], where\r\nno one can enter with safety, except the priest of the great Mother of\r\nthe Gods. In other places there are prophetic caves, where those who\r\nare intoxicated with the vapour which rises from them predict future\r\nevents[595], as at the most noble of all oracles, Delphi. In which\r\ncases, what mortal is there who can assign any other cause, than the\r\ndivine power of nature, which is everywhere diffused, and thus bursts\r\nforth in various places?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 96. (94.)—OF CERTAIN LANDS WHICH ARE ALWAYS SHAKING, AND OF\r\nFLOATING ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certain lands which shake when any one passes over them[596];\r\nas in the territory of the Gabii, not far from the city of Rome, there\r\nare about 200 acres which shake when cavalry passes over it: the same\r\nthing takes place at Reate.\r\n\r\n(95.) There are certain islands which are always floating[597], as in\r\nthe territory of the Cæcubum[598], and of the above-mentioned Reate,\r\nof Mutina, and of Statonia. In the lake of Vadimonis and the waters of\r\nCutiliæ there is a dark wood, which is never seen in the same place for\r\na day and a night together. In Lydia, the islands named Calaminæ are\r\nnot only driven about by the wind, but may be even pushed at pleasure\r\nfrom place to place, by poles: many citizens saved themselves by this\r\nmeans in the Mithridatic war. There are some small islands in the\r\nNymphæus, called the Dancers[599], because, when choruses are sung,\r\nthey are moved by the motions of those who beat time. In the great\r\nItalian lake of Tarquinii, there are two islands with groves on them,\r\nwhich are driven about by the wind, so as at one time to exhibit the\r\nfigure of a triangle and at another of a circle; but they never form a\r\nsquare[600].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 97. (96.)—PLACES IN WHICH IT NEVER RAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is at Paphos a celebrated temple of Venus, in a certain court of\r\nwhich it never rains; also at Nea, a town of Troas, in the spot which\r\nsurrounds the statue of Minerva: in this place also the remains of\r\nanimals that are sacrificed never putrefy[601].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 98.—THE WONDERS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES COLLECTED TOGETHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear Harpasa, a town of Asia, there stands a terrific rock, which may\r\nbe moved by a single finger; but if it be pushed by the force of the\r\nwhole body, it resists[602]. In the Tauric peninsula, in the state of\r\nthe Parasini, there is a kind of earth which cures all wounds[603].\r\nAbout Assos, in Troas, a stone is found, by which all bodies are\r\nconsumed; it is called Sarcophagus[604]. There are two mountains near\r\nthe river Indus; the nature of one is to attract iron, of the other to\r\nrepel it: hence, if there be nails in the shoes, the feet cannot be\r\ndrawn off the one, or set down on the other[605]. It has been noticed,\r\nthat at Locris and Crotona, there has never been a pestilence, nor have\r\nthey ever suffered from an earthquake; in Lycia there are always forty\r\ncalm days before an earthquake. In the territory of Argyripa the corn\r\nwhich is sown never springs up. At the altars of Mucius, in the country\r\nof the Veii, and about Tusculum, and in the Cimmerian Forest, there are\r\nplaces in which things that are pushed into the ground cannot be pulled\r\nout again. The hay which is grown in Crustuminium is noxious on the\r\nspot, but elsewhere it is wholesome[606].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 99. (97.)—CONCERNING THE CAUSE OF THE FLOWING AND EBBING OF THE\r\nSEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch has been said about the nature of waters; but the most wonderful\r\ncircumstance is the alternate flowing and ebbing of the tides, which\r\nexists, indeed, under various forms, but is caused by the sun and the\r\nmoon. The tide flows twice and ebbs twice between each two risings\r\nof the moon, always in the space of twenty-four hours. First, the\r\nmoon rising with the stars[607] swells out the tide, and after some\r\ntime, having gained the summit of the heavens, she declines from the\r\nmeridian and sets, and the tide subsides. Again, after she has set, and\r\nmoves in the heavens under the earth, as she approaches the meridian\r\non the opposite side, the tide flows in; after which it recedes\r\nuntil she again rises to us. But the tide of the next day is never\r\nat the same time with that of the preceding; as if the planet was in\r\nattendance[608], greedily drinking up the sea, and continually rising\r\nin a different place from what she did the day before. The intervals\r\nare, however, equal, being always of six hours; not indeed in respect\r\nof any particular day or night or place[609], but equinoctial hours,\r\nand therefore they are unequal as estimated by the length of common\r\nhours, since a greater number of them[610] fall on some certain days or\r\nnights, and they are never equal everywhere except at the equinox. This\r\nis a great, most clear, and even divine proof of the dullness of those,\r\nwho deny that the stars go below the earth and rise up again, and that\r\nnature presents the same face in the same states of their rising and\r\nsetting[611]; for the course of the stars is equally obvious in the one\r\ncase as in the other, producing the same effect as when it is manifest\r\nto the sight.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference in the tides, depending on the moon, of a\r\ncomplicated nature, and, first, as to the period of seven days. For the\r\ntides are of moderate height from the new moon to the first quarter;\r\nfrom this time they increase, and are the highest at the full: they\r\nthen decrease. On the seventh day they are equal to what they were at\r\nthe first quarter, and they again increase from the time that she is\r\nat first quarter on the other side. At her conjunction with the sun\r\nthey are equally high as at the full. When the moon is in the northern\r\nhemisphere, and recedes further from the earth, the tides are lower\r\nthan when, going towards the south, she exercises her influence at a\r\nless distance[612]. After an interval of eight years, and the hundredth\r\nrevolution of the moon, the periods and the heights of the tides return\r\ninto the same order as at first, this planet always acting upon them;\r\nand all these effects are likewise increased by the annual changes of\r\nthe sun[613], the tides rising up higher at the equinoxes, and more so\r\nat the autumnal than at the vernal; while they are lower[614] about the\r\nwinter solstice, and still more so at the summer solstice; not indeed\r\nprecisely at the points of time which I have mentioned, but a few days\r\nafter[615]; for example, not exactly at the full nor at the new moon,\r\nbut after them; and not immediately when the moon becomes visible or\r\ninvisible, or has advanced to the middle of her course, but generally\r\nabout two hours later than the equinoctial hours[616]; the effect of\r\nwhat is going on in the heavens being felt after a short interval; as\r\nwe observe with respect to lightning, thunder, and thunderbolts.\r\n\r\nBut the tides of the ocean cover greater spaces and produce greater\r\ninundations than the tides of the other seas; whether it be that the\r\nwhole of the universe taken together is more full of life than its\r\nindividual parts, or that the large open space feels more sensibly the\r\npower of the planet, as it moves freely about, than when restrained\r\nwithin narrow bounds. On which account neither lakes nor rivers are\r\nmoved in the same manner. Pytheas[617] of Massilia informs us, that in\r\nBritain the tide rises 80 cubits[618]. Inland seas are enclosed as in a\r\nharbour, but, in some parts of them, there is a more free space which\r\nobeys the influence[619]. Among many other examples, the force of the\r\ntide will carry us in three days from Italy to Utica, when the sea is\r\ntranquil and there is no impulse from the sails[620]. But these motions\r\nare more felt about the shores than in the deep parts of the seas, as\r\nin the body the extremities of the veins feel the pulse, which is the\r\nvital spirit, more than the other parts[621]. And in most estuaries,\r\non account of the unequal rising of the stars in each tract, the tides\r\ndiffer from each other, but this respects the period, not the nature of\r\nthem; as is the case in the Syrtes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 100.—WHERE THE TIDES RISE AND FALL IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some tides which are of a peculiar nature, as in\r\nthe Tauromenian Euripus[622], where the ebb and flow is more frequent\r\nthan in other places, and in Eubœa, where it takes place seven times\r\nduring the day and the night. The tides intermit three times during\r\neach month, being the 7th, 8th and 9th day of the moon[623]. At Gades,\r\nwhich is very near the temple of Hercules, there is a spring enclosed\r\nlike a well, which sometimes rises and falls with the ocean, and, at\r\nother times, in both respects contrary to it. In the same place there\r\nis another well, which always agrees with the ocean. On the shores of\r\nthe Bætis[624], there is a town where the wells become lower when the\r\ntide rises, and fill again when it ebbs; while at other times they\r\nremain stationary. The same thing occurs in one well in the town of\r\nHispalis[625], while there is nothing peculiar in the other wells. The\r\nEuxine always flows into the Propontis, the water never flowing back\r\ninto the Euxine[626].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 101. (98.)—WONDERS OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll seas are purified at the full moon[627]; some also at stated\r\nperiods. At Messina and Mylæ a refuse matter, like dung[628], is cast\r\nup on the shore, whence originated the story of the oxen of the Sun\r\nhaving had their stable at that place. To what has been said above (not\r\nto omit anything with which I am acquainted) Aristotle adds, that no\r\nanimal dies except when the tide is ebbing. The observation has been\r\noften made on the ocean of Gaul; but it has only been found true with\r\nrespect to man[629].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 102. (99.)—THE POWER OF THE MOON OVER THE LAND AND THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHence we may certainly conjecture, that the moon is not unjustly\r\nregarded as the star of our life[630]. This it is that replenishes the\r\nearth[631]; when she approaches it, she fills all bodies, while, when\r\nshe recedes, she empties them. From this cause it is that shell-fish\r\ngrow with her increase[632], and that those animals which are without\r\nblood more particularly experience her influence; also, that the blood\r\nof man is increased or diminished in proportion to the quantity of\r\nher light; also that the leaves and vegetables generally, as I shall\r\ndescribe in the proper place[633], feel her influence, her power\r\npenetrating all things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 103. (100.)—THE POWER OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFluids are dried up by the heat of the sun; we have therefore regarded\r\nit as a masculine star, burning up and absorbing everything[634].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 104.—WHY THE SEA IS SALT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHence it is that the widely-diffused sea is impregnated with the\r\nflavour of salt, in consequence of what is sweet and mild being\r\nevaporated from it, which the force of fire easily accomplishes;\r\nwhile all the more acrid and thick matter is left behind; on which\r\naccount the water of the sea is less salt at some depth than at the\r\nsurface. And this is a more true cause of the acrid flavour, than that\r\nthe sea is the continued perspiration of the land[635], or that the\r\ngreater part of the dry vapour is mixed with it, or that the nature of\r\nthe earth is such that it impregnates the waters, and, as it were,\r\nmedicates them[636]. Among the prodigies which have occurred, there is\r\none which happened when Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, was expelled\r\nfrom his kingdom; that, for the space of one day, the water in the\r\nharbour became sweet.\r\n\r\n(101.) The moon, on the contrary, is said to be a feminine and delicate\r\nplanet, and also nocturnal; also that it resolves humours and draws\r\nthem out, but does not carry them off. It is manifest that the carcases\r\nof wild beasts are rendered putrid by its beams, that, during sleep, it\r\ndraws up the accumulated torpor into the head, that it melts ice, and\r\nrelaxes all things by its moistening spirit[637]. Thus the changes of\r\nnature compensate each other, and are always adequate to their destined\r\npurpose; some of them congealing the elements of the stars and others\r\ndissolving them. The moon is said to be fed by fresh, and the sun by\r\nsalt water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 105. (102.)—WHERE THE SEA IS THE DEEPEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nFabianus[638] informs us that the greatest depth of the sea is 15\r\nstadia[639]. We learn from others, that in the Euxine, opposite to the\r\nnation of the Coraxi, at what is called the Depths of the Euxine[640],\r\nabout 300 stadia[641] from the main land, the sea is immensely deep, no\r\nbottom having been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 106. (103.)—THE WONDERS OF FOUNTAINS AND RIVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable that fresh water should burst out close to\r\nthe sea, as from pipes. But there is no end to the wonders that are\r\nconnected with the nature of waters. Fresh water floats on sea water,\r\nno doubt from its being lighter; and therefore sea water, which is of\r\na heavier nature[642], supports better what floats upon it. And, in\r\nsome places, different kinds of fresh water float upon each other; as\r\nthat of the river which falls into the Fucinus; that of the Addua into\r\nthe Larius; of the Ticinus into the Verbanus; of the Mincius into the\r\nBenacus; of the Ollius into the Sevinus; and of the Rhone into the\r\nLeman lake[643] (this last being beyond the Alps, the others in Italy):\r\nall which rivers passing through the lakes for many miles, generally\r\ncarry off no more water than they bring with them. The same thing is\r\nsaid to occur in the Orontes, a river of Syria, and in many others.\r\n\r\nSome rivers, from a real hatred of the sea, pass under it, as does\r\nArethusa, a fountain of Syracuse, in which the substances are found\r\nthat are thrown into the Alpheus; which, after flowing by Olympia, is\r\ndischarged into the sea, on the shore of the Peloponnesus[644]. The\r\nLycus in Asia[645], the Erasinus in Argolis, and the Tigris[646] in\r\nMesopotamia, sink into the earth and burst out again. Substances which\r\nare thrown into the fountain of Æsculapius at Athens[647] are cast up\r\nat the fountain of Phalerum. The river which sinks into the ground\r\nin the plain of Atinum[648] comes up again at the distance of twenty\r\nmiles, and the Timavus does the same in Aquileia[649].\r\n\r\nIn the lake Asphaltites, in Judæa, which produces bitumen, no substance\r\nwill sink, nor in the lake Arethusa[650], in the Greater Armenia: in\r\nthis lake, although it contains nitre, fish are found. In the country\r\nof the Salentini, near the town of Manduria, there is a lake[651] full\r\nto the brim, the waters of which are never diminished by what is taken\r\nout of it, nor increased by what is added. Wood, which is thrown into\r\nthe river of the Cicones[652], or into the lake Velinus in Picenum,\r\nbecomes coated with a stony crust, while in the Surius, a river of\r\nColchis, the whole substance becomes as hard as stone. In the same\r\nmanner, in the Silarus[653], beyond Surrentum, not only twigs which\r\nare immersed in it, but likewise leaves are petrified; the water at the\r\nsame time being proper for drinking. In the stream which runs from the\r\nmarsh of Reate[654] there is a rock, which continues to increase in\r\nsize, and in the Red Sea olive-trees and green shrubs are produced[655].\r\n\r\nThere are many springs which are remarkable for their warmth. This\r\nis the case even among the ridges of the Alps[656], and in the sea\r\nitself, between Italy and Ænaria, as in the bay of Baiæ, and in the\r\nLiris and many other rivers[657]. There are many places in which fresh\r\nwater may be procured from the sea, as at the Chelidonian Isles, and\r\nat Arados, and in the ocean at Gades. Green plants are produced in\r\nthe warm springs of Padua, frogs in those of Pisa, and fish in those\r\nof Vetulonia in Etruria, which is not far from the sea. In Casinas\r\nthere is a cold river called Scatebra, which in summer is more full\r\nof water[658]. In this, as in the river Stymphalis, in Arcadia, small\r\nwater-mice are produced. The fountain of Jupiter in Dodona, although\r\nit is as cold as ice, and extinguishes torches that are plunged into\r\nit, yet, if they be brought near it, it kindles them again[659].\r\nThis spring always becomes dry at noon, from which circumstance it\r\nis called Ἀναπαυόμενον[660]: it then increases and becomes full at\r\nmidnight, after which it again visibly decreases. In Illyricum there is\r\na cold spring, over which if garments are spread they take fire. The\r\npool of Jupiter Ammon, which is cold during the day, is warm during\r\nthe night[661]. In the country of the Troglodytæ[662], what they call\r\nthe Fountain of the Sun, about noon is fresh and very cold; it then\r\ngradually grows warm, and, at midnight, becomes hot and saline[663].\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the day, during summer, the source of the Po, as if\r\nreposing itself, is always dry[664]. In the island of Tenedos there\r\nis a spring, which, after the summer solstice, is full of water, from\r\nthe third hour of the night to the sixth[665]. The fountain Inopus, in\r\nthe island of Delos, decreases and increases in the same manner as the\r\nNile, and also at the same periods[666]. There is a small island in the\r\nsea, opposite to the river Timavus, containing warm springs, which\r\nincrease and decrease at the same time with the tides of the sea[667].\r\nIn the territory of Pitinum, on the other side of the Apennines, the\r\nriver Novanus, which during the solstice is quite a torrent, is dry in\r\nthe winter[668].\r\n\r\nIn Faliscum, all the water which the oxen drink turns them white; in\r\nBœotia, the river Melas turns the sheep black; the Cephissus, which\r\nflows out of a lake of the same name, turns them white[669]; again,\r\nthe Peneus turns them black, and the Xanthus, near Ilium, makes them\r\nred, whence the river derives its name[670]. In Pontus, the river\r\nAstaces waters certain plains, where the mares give black milk, which\r\nthe people use in diet. In Reate there is a spring called Neminia,\r\nwhich rises up sometimes in one place and sometimes in another, and in\r\nthis way indicates a change in the produce of the earth[671]. There\r\nis a spring in the harbour of Brundisium that yields water which\r\nnever becomes putrid at sea. The water of the Lyncestis, which is\r\nsaid to be acidulous, intoxicates like wine[672]; this is the case\r\nalso in Paphlagonia[673] and in the territory of Calenum[674]. In the\r\nisland of Andros, at the temple of Father Bacchus, we are assured by\r\nMucianus, who was thrice consul, that there is a spring, which, on the\r\nnones of January, always has the flavour of wine; it is called Διὸς\r\nΘεοδοσία[675]. Near Nonacris, in Arcadia, the Styx[676], which is not\r\nunlike it either in odour or in colour, instantly destroys those who\r\ndrink it. Also in Librosus, a hill in the country of the Tauri, there\r\nare three springs which inevitably produce death, but without pain.\r\nIn the territory of the Carrinenses in Spain[677], two springs burst\r\nout close together, the one of which absorbs everything, the other\r\nthrows them out. In the same country there is another spring, which\r\ngives to all the fish the appearance of gold, although, when out of\r\nthe water, they do not differ in any respect from other fish. In the\r\nterritory of Como, near the Larian lake, there is a copious spring,\r\nwhich always swells up and subsides again every hour[678]. In the\r\nisland of Cydonea[679], before Lesbos, there is a warm fountain, which\r\nflows only during the spring season. The lake Sinnaus[680], in Asia, is\r\nimpregnated with wormwood, which grows about it. At Colophon, in the\r\ncave of the Clarian Apollo, there is a pool, by the drinking of which a\r\npower is acquired of uttering wonderful oracles; but the lives of those\r\nwho drink of it are shortened[681]. In our own times, during the last\r\nyears of Nero’s life, we have seen rivers flowing backwards, as I have\r\nstated in my history of his times[682].\r\n\r\nAnd indeed who can be mistaken as to the fact, that all springs are\r\ncolder in summer than in winter[683], as well as these other wonderful\r\noperations of nature; that copper and lead sink when in a mass, but\r\nfloat when spread out[684]; and of things that are equally heavy, some\r\nwill sink to the bottom, while others will remain on the surface[685];\r\nthat heavy bodies are more easily moved in water[686]; that a stone\r\nfrom Scyros, although very large, will float, while the same, when\r\nbroken into small pieces, sinks[687]; that the body of an animal,\r\nnewly deprived of life, sinks, but that, when it is swelled out, it\r\nfloats[688]; that empty vessels are drawn out of the water with no more\r\nease than those that are full[689]; that rain-water is more useful for\r\nsalt-pits than other kinds of water[690]; that salt cannot be made,\r\nunless it is mixed with fresh water[691]; that salt water freezes\r\nwith more difficulty[692], and is more readily heated[693]; that the\r\nsea is warmer in winter[694] and more salt in the autumn[695]; that\r\neverything is soothed by oil, and that this is the reason why divers\r\nsend out small quantities of it from their mouths, because it smoothes\r\nany part which is rough[696] and transmits the light to them; that\r\nsnow never falls in the deep part of the sea[697]; that although water\r\ngenerally has a tendency downwards, fountains rise up[698], and that\r\nthis is the case even at the foot of Ætna[699], burning as it does, so\r\nas to force out the sand like a ball of flame to the distance of 150\r\nmiles?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 107.—THE WONDERS OF FIRE AND WATER UNITED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now I must give an account of some of the wonders of fire, which\r\nis the fourth element of nature; but first those produced by means of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 108. (104.)—OF MALTHA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Samosata, a city of Commagene[700], there is a pool which discharges\r\nan inflammable mud, called Maltha[701]. It adheres to every solid\r\nbody which it touches, and moreover, when touched, it follows you,\r\nif you attempt to escape from it. By means of it the people defended\r\ntheir walls against Lucullus, and the soldiers were burned in their\r\narmour[702]. It is even set on fire in water. We learn by experience\r\nthat it can be extinguished only by earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 109. (105.)—OF NAPHTHA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaphtha is a substance of a similar nature[703] (it is so called about\r\nBabylon, and in the territory of the Astaceni, in Parthia[704]),\r\nflowing like liquid bitumen. It has a great affinity to fire, which\r\ninstantly darts on it wherever it is seen[705]. It is said, that\r\nin this way it was that Medea burned Jason’s mistress; her crown\r\nhaving taken fire, when she approached the altar for the purpose of\r\nsacrificing[706].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 110. (106.)—PLACES WHICH ARE ALWAYS BURNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the wonders of mountains there is Ætna, which always burns in\r\nthe night[707], and for so long a period has always had materials for\r\ncombustion, being in the winter buried in snow, and having the ashes\r\nwhich it has ejected covered with frost. Nor is it in this mountain\r\nalone that nature rages, threatening to consume the earth[708]; in\r\nPhaselis, the mountain Chimæra burns, and indeed with a continual\r\nflame, day and night[709]. Ctesias of Cnidos informs us, that this\r\nfire is kindled by water, while it is extinguished by earth and by\r\nhay[710]. In the same country of Lycia, the mountains of Hephæstius,\r\nwhen touched with a flaming torch[711], burn so violently, that even\r\nthe stones in the river and the sand burn, while actually in the water:\r\nthis fire is also increased by rain. If a person makes furrows in the\r\nground with a stick which has been kindled at this fire, it is said\r\nthat a stream of flame will follow it. The summit of Cophantus, in\r\nBactria[712], burns during the night; and this is the case in Media and\r\nat Sittacene[713], on the borders of Persia; likewise in Susa, at the\r\nWhite Tower, from fifteen apertures[714], the greatest of which also\r\nburns in the daytime. The plain of Babylon throws up flame from a place\r\nlike a fish-pond[715], an acre in extent. Near Hesperium, a mountain\r\nof the Æthiopians[716], the fields shine in the night-time like stars;\r\nthe same thing takes place in the territory of the Megalopolitani.\r\nThis fire, however, is internal[717], mild, and not burning the foliage\r\nof a dense wood which is over it[718]. There is also the crater of\r\nNymphæum[719], which is always burning, in the neighbourhood of a\r\ncold fountain, and which, according to Theopompus, presages direful\r\ncalamities to the inhabitants of Apollonia[720]. It is increased by\r\nrain[721], and it throws out bitumen, which, becoming mixed with the\r\nfountain, renders it unfit to be tasted; it is, at other times, the\r\nweakest of all the bitumens. But what are these compared to other\r\nwonders? Hiera, one of the Æolian isles, in the middle of the sea, near\r\nItaly, together with the sea itself, during the Social war, burned\r\nfor several days[722], until expiation was made, by a deputation from\r\nthe senate. There is a hill in Æthiopia called Θεῶν ὄχημα[723], which\r\nburns with the greatest violence, throwing out flame that consumes\r\neverything, like the sun[724]. In so many places, and with so many\r\nfires, does nature burn the earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 111. (107.)—WONDERS OF FIRE ALONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since this one element is of so prolific a nature as to produce\r\nitself, and to increase from the smallest spark, what must we suppose\r\nwill be the effect of all those funeral piles of the earth[725]? What\r\nmust be the nature of that thing, which, in all parts of the world,\r\nsupplies this most greedy voracity without destroying itself? To these\r\nfires must be added those innumerable stars and the great sun itself.\r\nThere are also the fires made by men[726], those which are innate in\r\ncertain kinds of stones, those produced by the friction of wood[727],\r\nand those in the clouds, which give rise to lightning. It really\r\nexceeds all other wonders, that one single day should pass in which\r\neverything is not consumed, especially when we reflect, that concave\r\nmirrors placed opposite to the sun’s rays produce flame more readily\r\nthan any other kind of fire; and that numerous small but natural fires\r\nabound everywhere. In Nymphæum there issues from a rock a fire which is\r\nkindled by rain; it also issues from the waters of the Scantia[728].\r\nThis indeed is a feeble flame, since it passes off, remaining only\r\na short time on any body to which it is applied: an ash tree, which\r\novershadows this fiery spring, remains always green[729]. In the\r\nterritory of Mutina fire issues from the ground on the days that are\r\nconsecrated to Vulcan[730]. It is stated by some authors, that if a\r\nburning body falls on the fields below Aricia[731], the ground is set\r\non fire; and that the stones in the territory of the Sabines and of\r\nthe Sidicini[732], if they be oiled, burn with flame. In Egnatia[733],\r\na town of Salentinum, there is a sacred stone, upon which, when\r\nwood is placed, flame immediately bursts forth. In the altar of Juno\r\nLacinia[734], which is in the open air, the ashes remain unmoved,\r\nalthough the winds may be blowing from all quarters.\r\n\r\nIt appears also that there are sudden fires both in waters and even in\r\nthe human body; that the whole of Lake Thrasymenus was on fire[735];\r\nthat when Servius Tullius, while a child, was sleeping, flame darted\r\nout from his head[736]; and Valerius Antias informs us, that the same\r\nflame appeared about L. Marcius, when he was pronouncing the funeral\r\noration over the Scipios, who were killed in Spain; and exhorting the\r\nsoldiers to avenge their death. I shall presently mention more facts of\r\nthis nature, and in a more distinct manner; in this place these wonders\r\nare mixed up with other subjects. But my mind, having carried me beyond\r\nthe mere interpretation of nature, is anxious to lead, as it were by\r\nthe hand, the thoughts of my readers over the whole globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 112. (108.)—THE DIMENSIONS OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur part of the earth, of which I propose to give an account, floating\r\nas it were in the ocean which surrounds it (as I have mentioned\r\nabove[737]), stretches out to the greatest extent from east to west,\r\nviz. from India to the Pillars consecrated to Hercules at Gades,\r\nbeing a distance of 8568 miles[738], according to the statement of\r\nArtemidorus[739], or according to that of Isidorus[740], 9818 miles.\r\nArtemidorus adds to this 491 miles, from Gades, going round by the\r\nSacred Promontory, to the promontory of Artabrum[741], which is the\r\nmost projecting part of Spain.\r\n\r\nThis measurement may be taken in two directions. From the Ganges, at\r\nits mouth, where it discharges itself into the Eastern ocean, passing\r\nthrough India and Parthyene, to Myriandrus[742], a city of Syria, in\r\nthe bay of Issus, is a distance of 5215 miles[743]. Thence, going\r\ndirectly by sea, by the island of Cyprus, Patara in Lycia, Rhodes,\r\nand Astypalæa, islands in the Carpathian sea, by Tænarum in Laconia,\r\nLilybæum in Sicily and Calaris in Sardinia, is 2103 miles. Thence to\r\nGlades is 1250 miles, making the whole distance from the Eastern ocean\r\n8568 miles[744].\r\n\r\nThe other way, which is more certain, is chiefly by land. From the\r\nGanges to the Euphrates is 5169 miles; thence to Mazaca, a town in\r\nCappadocia, is 319 miles; thence, through Phrygia and Caria, to Ephesus\r\nis 415 miles; from Ephesus, across the Ægean sea to Delos, is 200\r\nmiles; to the Isthmus is 212-1/2 miles; thence, first by land and\r\nafterwards by the sea of Lechæum and the gulf of Corinth, to Patræ in\r\nPeloponnesus, 90 miles; to the promontory of Leucate 87-1/2 miles;\r\nas much more to Corcyra; to the Acroceraunian mountains 132-1/2, to\r\nBrundisium 87-1/2, and to Rome 360 miles. To the Alps, at the village\r\nof Scingomagum[745], is 519 miles; through Gaul to Illiberis at the\r\nPyrenees, 927; to the ocean and the coast of Spain, 331 miles; across\r\nthe passage of Gades 7-1/2 miles; which distances, according to the\r\nestimate of Artemidorus, make altogether 8945 miles.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the earth, from south to north, is commonly supposed\r\nto be about one-half only of its length, viz. 4490 miles; hence it is\r\nevident how much the heat has stolen from it on one side and the cold\r\non the other: for I do not suppose that the land is actually wanting,\r\nor that the earth has not the form of a globe; but that, on each side,\r\nthe uninhabitable parts have not been discovered. This measure then\r\nextends from the coast of the Æthiopian ocean, the most distant part\r\nwhich is habitable, to Meroë, 1000 miles[746]; thence to Alexandria\r\n1250; to Rhodes 562; to Cnidos 87-1/2; to Cos 25; to Samos 100; to\r\nChios 94; to Mitylene 65; to Tenedos 44; to the promontory of Sigæum\r\n12-1/2; to the entrance of the Euxine 312-1/2; to the promontory of\r\nCarambis 350; to the entrance of the Palus Mæotis 312-1/2; and to the\r\nmouth of the Tanais 275 miles, which distance, if we went by sea, might\r\nbe shortened 89 miles. Beyond the Tanais the most diligent authors have\r\nnot been able to obtain any accurate measurement. Artemidorus supposes\r\nthat everything beyond is undiscovered, since he confesses that, about\r\nthe Tanais, the tribes of the Sarmatæ dwell, who extend towards the\r\nnorth pole. Isidorus adds 1250 miles, as the distance to Thule[747];\r\nbut this is mere conjecture. For my part, I believe that the boundaries\r\nof Sarmatia really extend to as great a distance as that mentioned\r\nabove: for if it were not very extensive, how could it contain the\r\ninnumerable tribes that are always changing their residence? And indeed\r\nI consider the uninhabitable portion of the world to be still greater;\r\nfor it is well known that there are innumerable islands lying off the\r\ncoast of Germany[748], which have been only lately discovered.\r\n\r\nThe above is all that I consider worth relating about the length and\r\nthe breadth of the earth[749]. But Eratosthenes[750], a man who was\r\npeculiarly well skilled in all the more subtle parts of learning,\r\nand in this above everything else, and a person whom I perceive to\r\nbe approved by every one, has stated the whole of this circuit to be\r\n252,000 stadia, which, according to the Roman estimate, makes 31,500\r\nmiles. The attempt is presumptuous, but it is supported by such\r\nsubtle arguments that we cannot refuse our assent. Hipparchus[751],\r\nwhom we must admire, both for the ability with which he controverts\r\nEratosthenes, as well as for his diligence in everything else, has\r\nadded to the above number not much less than 25,000 stadia.\r\n\r\n(109.) Dionysodorus is certainly less worthy of confidence[752]; but\r\nI cannot omit this most remarkable instance of Grecian vanity. He was\r\na native of Melos, and was celebrated for his knowledge of geometry;\r\nhe died of old age in his native country. His female relations, who\r\ninherited his property, attended his funeral, and when they had for\r\nseveral successive days performed the usual rites, they are said to\r\nhave found in his tomb an epistle written in his own name to those left\r\nabove; it stated that he had descended from his tomb to the lowest part\r\nof the earth, and that it was a distance of 42,000 stadia. There were\r\nnot wanting certain geometricians, who interpreted this epistle as if\r\nit had been sent from the middle of the globe, the point which is at\r\nthe greatest distance from the surface, and which must necessarily be\r\nthe centre of the sphere. Hence the estimate has been made that it is\r\n252,000 stadia in circumference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 113.—THE HARMONICAL PROPORTION OF THE UNIVERSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat harmonical proportion, which compels nature to be always\r\nconsistent with itself, obliges us to add to the above measure, 12,000\r\nstadia; and this makes the earth one ninety-sixth part of the whole\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—The facts, statements, and observations contained in this Book\r\namount in number to 417.\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—M.

I shall now proceed to describe its individual parts;\r\nalthough indeed we may with reason look upon the task as of an infinite\r\nnature, and one not to be rashly commenced upon without incurring\r\ncensure. And yet, on the other hand, there is nothing which ought less\r\nto require an apology, if it is only considered how far from surprising\r\nit is that a mere mortal cannot be acquainted with everything. I shall\r\ntherefore not follow any single author, but shall employ, in relation\r\nto each subject, such writers as I shall look upon as most worthy of\r\ncredit. For, indeed, it is the characteristic of nearly all of them,\r\nthat they display the greatest care and accuracy in the description of\r\nthe countries in which they respectively flourished; so that by doing\r\nthis, I shall neither have to blame nor contradict any one.\r\n\r\nThe names of the different places will here be simply given, and as\r\nbriefly as possible; the account of their celebrity, and the events\r\nwhich have given rise thereto, being deferred to a more appropriate\r\noccasion; for it must be remembered that I am here speaking of the\r\nearth as a whole, and I wish to be understood as using the names\r\nwithout any reference whatever to their celebrity, and as though the\r\nplaces themselves were in their infancy, and had not as yet acquired\r\nany fame through great events. The name is mentioned, it is true, but\r\nonly as forming a part of the world and the system of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe whole globe is divided into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Africa.\r\nOur description commences where the sun sets and at the Straits of\r\nGades[798], where the Atlantic ocean, bursting in, is poured forth\r\ninto the inland seas. As it makes its entrance from that side, Africa\r\nis on the right hand and Europe on the left; Asia lies between\r\nthem[799]; the boundaries being the rivers Tanais[800] and Nile. The\r\nStraits of the ocean, of which I have just spoken, extend fifteen\r\nmiles in length and five[801] in breadth, measured from the village\r\nof Mellaria[802] in Spain to the Album Promontorium[803] or White\r\nPromontory in Africa, as we learn from Turranius Gracilis, who was born\r\nin that vicinity. Titus Livius and Cornelius Nepos however have stated\r\nthe breadth, where it is least, to be seven miles, and where greatest,\r\nten; from so small a mouth as this does so immense an expanse of water\r\nopen upon us! Nor is our astonishment diminished by the fact of its\r\nbeing of great depth; for, instead of that, there are numerous breakers\r\nand shoals, white with foam, to strike the mariner with alarm. From\r\nthis circumstance it is, that many have called this spot the threshold\r\nof The Inland Sea.\r\n\r\nAt the narrowest part of the Straits, there are mountains placed to\r\nform barriers to the entrance on either side, Abyla[804] in Africa,\r\nand Calpe[805] in Europe, the boundaries formerly of the labours of\r\nHercules[806]. Hence it is that the inhabitants have called them the\r\nColumns of that god; they also believe that they were dug through by\r\nhim; upon which the sea, which was before excluded, gained admission,\r\nand so changed the face of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 1. (1.)—THE BOUNDARIES AND GULFS OF EUROPE FIRST SET FORTH IN A\r\nGENERAL WAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall first then speak of Europe, the foster-mother of that people\r\nwhich has conquered all other nations, and itself by far the most\r\nbeauteous portion of the earth. Indeed, many persons have, not without\r\nreason[807], considered it, not as a third part only of the earth,\r\nbut as equal to all the rest, looking upon the whole of our globe as\r\ndivided into two parts only, by a line drawn from the river Tanais\r\nto the Straits of Gades. The ocean, after pouring the waters of the\r\nAtlantic through the inlet which I have here described, and, in its\r\neager progress, overwhelming all the lands which have had to dread its\r\napproach, skirts with its winding course the shores of those parts\r\nwhich offer a more effectual resistance, hollowing out the coast of\r\nEurope especially into numerous bays, among which there are four Gulfs\r\nthat are more particularly remarkable. The first of these begins at\r\nCalpe, which I have previously mentioned, the most distant mountain of\r\nSpain; and bends, describing an immense curve, as far as Locri and the\r\nPromontory of Bruttium[808].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2.—OF SPAIN GENERALLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first land situate upon this Gulf is that which is called the\r\nFarther Spain or Bætica[809]; next to which, beginning at the frontier\r\ntown of Urgi[810], is the Nearer, or Tarraconensian[811] Spain,\r\nextending as far as the chain of the Pyrenees. The Farther Spain is\r\ndivided lengthwise into two provinces, Lusitania[812] and Bætica, the\r\nformer stretching along the northern side of the latter, and being\r\ndivided from it by the river Ana[813].\r\n\r\nThe source of this river is in the district of Laminium[814], in the\r\nNearer Spain. It first spreads out into a number of small lakes,\r\nand then again contracts itself into a narrow channel, or entirely\r\ndisappears under ground[815], and after frequently disappearing and\r\nagain coming to light, finally discharges itself into the Atlantic\r\nOcean. Tarraconensian Spain lies on one side, contiguous to the\r\nPyrenees, running downwards along the sides of that chain, and,\r\nstretching across from the Iberian Sea to the Gallic ocean[816],\r\nis separated from Bætica and Lusitania by Mount Solorius[817], the\r\nchains of the Oretani[818] and the Carpetani[819], and that of the\r\nAstures[820].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3.—OF BÆTICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBætica, so called from the river which divides it in the middle, excels\r\nall the other provinces in the richness of its cultivation and the\r\npeculiar fertility and beauty of its vegetation.\r\n\r\nIt consists of four jurisdictions, those of Gades[821], of\r\nCorduba[822], of Astigi[823], and of Hispalis[824]. The total number of\r\nits towns is 175; of these nine are colonies[825], and eight municipal\r\ntowns[826]; twenty-nine have been long since presented with the old\r\nLatin rights[827]; six are free towns[828], three federate[829], and\r\n120 tributary.\r\n\r\nIn this district, the things that more especially deserve notice, or\r\nare more easily explained in the Latin tongue, are the following,\r\nbeginning at the river Ana, along the line of the sea-shore; the town\r\nof Onoba, surnamed Æstuaria[830]; the rivers Luxia and Urium[831],\r\nflowing through this territory between the Ana and the Bætis; the\r\nMarian[832] Mountains; the river Bætis; the coast of Corum[833], with\r\nits winding bay; opposite to which is Gades, of which we shall have\r\noccasion to speak among the islands[834]. Next comes the Promontory\r\nof Juno[835], and the port of Bæsippo[836]; the towns of Bœlo[837]\r\nand Mellaria[838], at which latter begin the Straits of the Atlantic;\r\nCarteia[839], called by the Greeks Tartessos[840]; and the mountain of\r\nCalpe.\r\n\r\nAlong the coast of the inland sea[841] is the town of Barbesula[842]\r\nwith its river; also Salduba[843]; the town of Suel[844]; and then\r\nMalaca[845], with its river, one of the federate towns. Next to this\r\ncomes Mænoba[846], with its river; then Sexifirmum[847], surnamed\r\nJulium; Selambina[848]; Abdera[849]; and Murci[850], which is at the\r\nboundary of Bætica. M. Agrippa supposed that all this coast was peopled\r\nby colonists of Punic origin. Beyond the Anas, and facing the Atlantic,\r\nis the country of the Bastuli[851] and the Turditani. M. Varro informs\r\nus, that the Iberians, the Persians, the Phœnicians, the Celts, and the\r\nCarthaginians spread themselves over the whole of Spain; that the name\r\n“Lusitania” is derived from the games (_lusus_) of Father Bacchus, or\r\nthe fury (_lyssa_[852]) of his frantic attendants, and that Pan[853]\r\nwas the governor of the whole of it. But the traditions respecting\r\nHercules[854] and Pyrene, as well as Saturn, I conceive to be fabulous\r\nin the highest degree.\r\n\r\nThe Bætis does not rise, as some writers have asserted, near the town\r\nof Mentisa[855], in the province of Tarraco, but in the Tugiensian\r\nForest[856]; and near it rises the river Tader[857], which waters the\r\nterritory of Carthage[858]. At Ilorcum[859] it turns away from the\r\nFuneral Pile[860] of Scipio; then taking a sweep to the left, it falls\r\ninto the Atlantic Ocean, giving its name to this province: at its\r\nsource it is but small, though during its course it receives many other\r\nstreams, which it deprives as well of their waters as their renown. It\r\nfirst enters Bætica in Ossigitania[861], and glides gently, with a\r\nsmooth current, past many towns situate on either side of its banks.\r\n\r\nBetween this river and the sea-shore the most celebrated places\r\ninland are Segida[862], also surnamed Augurina; Julia[863], called\r\nFidentia; Urgao[864] or Alba, Ebora[865] or Cerealis, Iliberri[866] or\r\nLiberini, Ilipula[867] or Laus, Artigi[868] or Julienses, Vesci[869]\r\nor Faventia, Singili[870], Attegua[871], Arialdunum, Agla Minor[872],\r\nBæbro[873], Castra Vinaria[874], Cisimbrium[875], Hippo Nova or New\r\nHippo[876], Ilurco[877], Osca[878], Escua[879], Sucubo[880], Nuditanum,\r\nOld Tuati[881]; all which towns are in that part of Bastitania which\r\nextends towards the sea, but in the jurisdiction[882] of Corduba. In\r\nthe neighbourhood of the river itself is Ossigi[883], also surnamed\r\nLaconicum, Iliturgi[884] or Forum Julium, Ipasturgi[885] or Triumphale,\r\nSetia, and, fourteen miles inland, Obulco[886], which is also called\r\nPontificense.\r\n\r\nNext to these comes Epora[887], a federate town, Sacili[888]\r\nMartialium, and Onoba[889]. On the right bank is Corduba, a Roman\r\ncolony, surnamed Patricia[890]; here the Bætis first becomes navigable.\r\nThere are also the towns of Carbula and Detunda[891], and the river\r\nSingulis[892], which falls into the Bætis on the same side.\r\n\r\nThe towns in the jurisdiction of Hispalis are the following: Celti,\r\nArua[893], Canama[894], Evia, Ilipa[895], surnamed Illa, and\r\nItalica[896]. On the left of the river is the colony of Hispalis[897]\r\nnamed Romuliensis, and, on the opposite side[898], the town of\r\nOsset[899], surnamed Julia Constantia, Vergentum, or Julî Genius[900],\r\nOrippo, Caura[901], Siarum, and the river Menoba[902], which enters the\r\nBætis on its right bank. Between the æstuaries of the Bætis lie the\r\ntowns of Nebrissa[903], surnamed Veneria, and of Colobona[904]. The\r\ncolonies are, Asta[905], which is also called Regia, and, more inland,\r\nthat of Asido[906], surnamed Cæsariana.\r\n\r\nThe river Singulis, discharging itself into the Bætis at the place\r\nalready mentioned, washes the colony of Astigi[907], surnamed Augusta\r\nFirma, at which place it becomes navigable. The other colonies in this\r\njurisdiction which are exempt from tribute are Tucci, surnamed Augusta\r\nGemella[908], Itucci called Virtus Julia[909], Attubi or Claritas\r\nJulia[910], Urso[911] or Genua Urbanorum; and among them in former\r\ntimes Munda[912], which was taken with the son of Pompey. The free\r\ntowns are Old Astigi[913] and Ostippo[914]; the tributary towns are\r\nCallet, Callecula, Castra Gemina, the Lesser Ilipula, Merucra, Sacrana,\r\nObulcula[915], and Oningis. As you move away from the sea-coast, near\r\nwhere the river Menoba is navigable, you find, at no great distance,\r\nthe Alontigiceli and the Alostigi[916].\r\n\r\nThe country which extends from the Bætis to the river Anas, beyond the\r\ndistricts already described, is called Bæturia, and is divided into two\r\nparts and the same number of nations; the Celtici[917], who border upon\r\nLusitania, in the jurisdiction of Hispalis, and the Turduli, who dwell\r\non the verge[918] of Lusitania and Tarraconensis, and are under the\r\nprotection of the laws of Corduba. It is evident that the Celtici have\r\nsprung from the Celtiberi, and have come from Lusitania, from their\r\nreligious rites, their language, and the names of their towns, which\r\nin Bætica are distinguished by the following epithets[919], which have\r\nbeen given to them. Seria has received the surname of Fama Julia[920],\r\nNertobriga that of Concordia Julia[921], Segida that of Restituta\r\nJulia[922], and Contributa[923] that of Julia. What is now Curiga\r\nwas formerly Ucultuniacum, Constantia Julia[924] was Laconimurgis,\r\nthe present Fortunales were the Tereses[925], and the Emanici were\r\nthe Callenses[926]. Besides these, there are in Celtica the towns of\r\nAcinippo[927], Arunda[928], Aruci[929], Turobriga, Lastigi, Salpesa,\r\nSæpone, and Serippo.\r\n\r\nThe other Bæturia, which we have mentioned, is inhabited by the\r\nTurduli, and, in the jurisdiction of Corduba, has some towns which are\r\nby no means inconsiderable; Arsa[930], Mellaria[931], Mirobriga[932],\r\nand Sisapo[933], in the district of Osintias.\r\n\r\nTo the jurisdiction of Gades belongs Regina, with Roman citizens; and\r\nLæpia, Ulia[934], Carisa[935] surnamed Aurelia, Urgia[936] or Castrum\r\nJulium, likewise called Cæsaris Salutariensis, all of which enjoy the\r\nLatian rights. The tributary towns are Besaro, Belippo[937], Barbesula,\r\nLacippo, Bæsippo, Callet, Cappacum, Oleastro, Ituci, Brana, Lacibi,\r\nSaguntia[938], and Audorisæ.\r\n\r\nM. Agrippa has also stated the whole length of this province to be\r\n475 miles[939], and its breadth 257; but this was at a time when its\r\nboundaries extended to Carthage[940], a circumstance which has often\r\ncaused great errors in calculations; which are generally the result\r\neither of changes effected in the limits of provinces, or of the fact\r\nthat in the reckoning of distances the length of the miles has been\r\narbitrarily increased or diminished. In some parts too the sea has been\r\nlong making encroachments upon the land, and in others again the shores\r\nhave advanced; while the course of rivers in this place has become more\r\nserpentine, in that more direct. And then, besides, some writers begin\r\ntheir measurements at one place, and some at another, and so proceed\r\nin different directions; and hence the result is, that no two accounts\r\nagree.\r\n\r\n(2.) At the present day the length of Bætica, from the town of\r\nCastulo[941], on its frontier, to Gades is 250 miles, and from Murci,\r\nwhich lies on the sea-coast, twenty-five miles more. The breadth,\r\nmeasured from the coast of Carteia, is 234 miles. Who is there that\r\ncan entertain the belief that Agrippa, a man of such extraordinary\r\ndiligence, and one who bestowed so much care on his subject, when he\r\nproposed to place before the eyes of the world a survey of that world,\r\ncould be guilty of such a mistake as this, and that too when seconded\r\nby the late emperor the divine Augustus? For it was that emperor who\r\ncompleted the Portico[942] which had been begun by his sister, and\r\nin which the survey was to be kept, in conformity with the plan and\r\ndescriptions of M. Agrippa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4. (3.)—OF NEARER SPAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancient form of the Nearer Spain, like that of many other\r\nprovinces, is somewhat changed, since the time when Pompey the Great,\r\nupon the trophies which he erected in the Pyrenees, testified that 877\r\ntowns, from the Alps to the borders of the Farther Spain, had been\r\nreduced to subjection by him. The whole province is now divided into\r\nseven jurisdictions, those of Carthage[943], of Tarraco, of Cæsar\r\nAugusta[944], of Clunia[945], of Asturica[946], of Lucus[947], and of\r\nthe Bracari[948]. To these are to be added the islands, which will be\r\ndescribed on another occasion, as also 293 states which are dependent\r\non others; besides which the province contains 179 towns. Of these,\r\ntwelve are colonies, thirteen, towns with the rights of Roman citizens,\r\neighteen with the old Latian rights, one confederate, and 135 tributary.\r\n\r\nThe first people that we come to on the coast are the Bastuli; after\r\nwhom, proceeding according to the order which I shall follow, as we\r\ngo inland, there are the Mentesani, the Oretani, and the Carpetani\r\non the Tagus, and next to them the Vaccæi, the Vectones, and the\r\nCeltiberian Arevaci. The towns nearest to the coast are Urci, and\r\nBarea[949] included in Bætica, the district of Mavitania, next to it\r\nDeitania, and then Contestania, and the colony of Carthago Nova; from\r\nthe Promontory of which, known as the Promontorium Saturni[950], to\r\nthe city of Cæsarea[951] in Mauritania, the passage is a distance of\r\n187 miles. The remaining objects worthy of mention on the coast are\r\nthe river Tader[952], and the free colony of Ilici[953], whence the\r\nIlicitanian Gulf[954] derives its name; to this colony the Icositani\r\nare subordinate.\r\n\r\nWe next have Lucentum[955], holding Latian rights; Dianium[956], a\r\ntributary town; the river Sucro[957], and in former times a town of the\r\nsame name, forming the frontier of Contestania. Next is the district\r\nof Edetania, with the delightful expanse of a lake[958] before it, and\r\nextending backward to Celtiberia. Valentia[959], a colony, is situate\r\nthree miles from the sea, after which comes the river Turium[960],\r\nand Saguntum[961] at the same distance, a town of Roman citizens\r\nfamous for its fidelity, the river Uduba[962], and the district of the\r\nIlergaones[963]. The Iberus[964], a river enriched by its commerce,\r\ntakes its rise in the country of the Cantabri, not far from the town\r\nof Juliobriga[965], and flows a distance of 450 miles; 260 of which,\r\nfrom the town of Varia[966] namely, it is available for the purposes of\r\nnavigation. From this river the name of Iberia has been given by the\r\nGreeks to the whole of Spain.\r\n\r\nNext comes the district of Cossetania, the river Subi[967], and the\r\ncolony of Tarraco, which was built by the Scipios as Carthage[968] was\r\nby the Carthaginians. Then the district of the Ilergetes, the town\r\nof Subur[969], and the river Rubricatum[970], beyond which begin the\r\nLaletani and the Indigetes[971]. Behind these, in the order in which\r\nthey will be mentioned, going back from the foot of the Pyrenees,\r\nare the Ausetani[972], the Lacetani[973], and along the Pyrenees, the\r\nCerretani[974], next to whom are the Vascones[975]. On the coast is the\r\ncolony of Barcino[976], surnamed Faventia; Bætulo[977] and Iluro[978],\r\ntowns with Roman citizens; the river Larnum[979], Blandæ[980], the\r\nriver Alba[981]; Emporiæ[982], a city consisting of two parts, one\r\npeopled by the original inhabitants, the other by the Greek descendants\r\nof the Phocæans; and the river Ticher[983]. From this to the Venus\r\nPyrenæa[984], on the other side of the Promontory, is a distance of\r\nforty miles.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to give an account of the more remarkable things\r\nin these several jurisdictions, in addition to those which have been\r\nalready mentioned. Forty-three different peoples are subject to the\r\njurisdiction of the courts of Tarraco: of these the most famous\r\nare—holding the rights of Roman citizens, the Dertusani[985] and the\r\nBisgargitani; enjoying Latian rights, the Ausetani, and the Cerretani,\r\nboth Julian and Augustan, the Edetani[986], the Gerundenses[987],\r\nthe Gessorienses[988], and the Teari[989], also called Julienses.\r\nAmong the tributaries are the Aquicaldenses[990], the Onenses, and the\r\nBæculonenses[991].\r\n\r\nCæsar Augusta, a free colony, watered by the river Iberus, on the\r\nsite of the town formerly called Salduba, is situate in the district\r\nof Edetania, and is the resort of fifty-five nations. Of these there\r\nare, with the rights of Roman citizens, the Bellitani[992], the\r\nCelsenses[993], a former colony, the Calagurritani[994], surnamed the\r\nNassici, the Ilerdenses[995], of the nation of the Surdaones, near whom\r\nis the river Sicoris, the Oscenses[996] in the district of Vescitania,\r\nand the Turiasonenses[997]. Of those enjoying the rights of the ancient\r\nLatins, there are the Cascantenses[998], the Ergavicenses[999], the\r\nGraccuritani[1000], the Leonicenses[1001], and the Osicerdenses; of\r\nfederate states, there are the Tarragenses[1002]; and of tributaries,\r\nthe Arcobrigenses[1003], the Andologenses[1004], the Aracelitani[1005],\r\nthe Bursaonenses[1006], the Calagurritani[1007], who are also surnamed\r\nthe Fibularenses, the Complutenses[1008], the Carenses[1009],\r\nthe Cincenses[1010], the Cortonenses, the Damanitani[1011], the\r\nLarnenses[1012], the Lursenses[1013], the Lumberitani[1014], the\r\nLacetani, the Lubienses, the Pompelonenses[1015], and the Segienses.\r\n\r\nSixty-five different nations resort to Carthage[1016], besides the\r\ninhabitants of the islands. Of the Accitanian[1017] colony, there\r\nare the Gemellenses, and the town of Libisosona[1018], surnamed\r\nForoaugustana, to both of which have been granted Italian[1019] rights.\r\nOf the colony of Salaria[1020], there are the people of the following\r\ntowns, enjoying the rights of ancient Latium: the Castulonenses, also\r\ncalled the Cæsari Venales, the Sætabitani[1021] or Augustani, and\r\nthe Valerienses[1022]. The best known among the tributaries are the\r\nAlabanenses[1023], the Bastitani[1024], the Consaburrenses[1025],\r\nthe Dianenses[1026], the Egelestani[1027], the Ilorcitani[1028],\r\nthe Laminitani, the Mentesani[1029], both those called Oritani and\r\nthose called Bastuli, and the Oretani who are surnamed Germani[1030],\r\nthe people of Segobriga[1031] the capital of Celtiberia, those of\r\nToletum[1032] the capital of Carpetania, situate on the river Tagus,\r\nand after them the Viatienses and the Virgilienses[1033].\r\n\r\nTo the jurisdiction of Clunia[1034] the Varduli contribute fourteen\r\nnations, of whom we need only particularize the Albanenses[1035],\r\nthe Turmodigi[1036], consisting of four tribes, among which are\r\nthe Segisamonenses[1037] and the Segisamaiulienses. To the same\r\njurisdiction belong the Carietes[1038] and the Vennenses with five\r\nstates, among which are the Velienses. Thither too resort the\r\nPelendones of the Celtiberians, in four different nations, among\r\nwhom the Numantini[1039] were especially famous. Also, among the\r\neighteen states of the Vaccæi, there are the Intercatienses[1040],\r\nthe Pallantini[1041], the Lacobrigenses, and the Caucenses[1042]. But\r\namong the seven peoples belonging to the Cantabri, Juliobriga[1043]\r\nis the only place worthy of mention; and of the ten states of the\r\nAutrigones, Tritium and Virovesca[1044]. The river Areva[1045] gives\r\nits name to the Arevaci; of whom there are six towns, Segontia[1046]\r\nand Uxama[1047], names which are frequently given to other places, as\r\nalso Segovia[1048] and Nova Augusta, Termes[1049], and Clunia itself,\r\nthe frontier of Celtiberia. The remaining portion turns off towards\r\nthe ocean, being occupied by the Varduli, already mentioned, and the\r\nCantabri.\r\n\r\nNext upon these touch the twenty-two nations of the Astures, who\r\nare divided into the Augustani[1050] and the Transmontani, with the\r\nmagnificent city of Asturica. Among these we have the Cigurri[1051],\r\nthe Pæsici, the Lancienses[1052], and the Zoëlæ[1053]. The total number\r\nof the free population amounts to 240,000 persons.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of Lucus[1054] embraces, besides the Celtici and the\r\nLebuni, sixteen different nations, but little known and with barbarous\r\nnames. The number however of the free population amounts to nearly\r\n166,000.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner the twenty-four states of the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Bracari contain a population of 175,000, among whom, besides the\r\nBracari[1055] themselves, we may mention, without wearying the reader,\r\nthe Bibali, the Cœlerni, the Gallæci, the Hequæsi, the Limici, and the\r\nQuerquerni.\r\n\r\nThe length of the Nearer Spain, from the Pyrenees to the frontier\r\nof Castulo, is 607[1056] miles, and a little more if we follow the\r\nline of the coast; while its breadth, from Tarraco to the shore of\r\nOlarson[1057], is 307[1058] miles. From the foot of the Pyrenees, where\r\nit is wedged in by the near approach of the two seas, it gradually\r\nexpands until it touches the Farther Spain, and thereby acquires a\r\nwidth more than double[1059].\r\n\r\nNearly the whole of Spain abounds in mines[1060] of lead, iron,\r\ncopper, silver, and gold; in the Nearer Spain there is also found lapis\r\nspecularis[1061]; in Bætica there is cinnabar. There are also quarries\r\nof marble. The Emperor Vespasianus Augustus, while still harassed by\r\nthe storms that agitated the Roman state, conferred the Latian rights\r\non the whole of Spain. The Pyrenean mountains divide Spain from Gaul,\r\ntheir extremities projecting into the two seas on either side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (4.)—OF THE PROVINCE OF GALLIA NARBONENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat part of the Gallias which is washed by the inland sea[1062] is\r\ncalled the province of [Gallia] Narbonensis[1063], having formerly\r\nborne the name of Braccata[1064]. It is divided from Italy by the river\r\nVarus[1065], and by the range of the Alps, the great safeguards of the\r\nRoman Empire. From the remainder of Gaul, on the north, it is separated\r\nby the mountains Cebenna[1066] and Jura[1067]. In the cultivation of\r\nthe soil, the manners and civilization of the inhabitants, and the\r\nextent of its wealth, it is surpassed by none of the provinces, and, in\r\nshort, might be more truthfully described as a part of Italy than as a\r\nprovince. On the coast we have the district of the Sordones[1068], and\r\nmore inland that of the Consuarani[1069]. The rivers are the Tecum\r\nand the Vernodubrum[1070]. The towns are Illiberis[1071], the scanty\r\nremains of what was formerly a great city, and Ruscino[1072], a town\r\nwith Latian rights. We then come to the river Atax[1073], which flows\r\nfrom the Pyrenees, and passes through the Rubrensian Lake[1074], the\r\ntown of Narbo Martius, a colony of the tenth legion, twelve miles\r\ndistant from the sea, and the rivers Arauris[1075] and Liria[1076].\r\nThe towns are otherwise but few in number, in consequence of the\r\nnumerous lakes[1077] which skirt the sea-shore. We have Agatha[1078],\r\nformerly belonging to the Massilians, and the district of the Volcæ\r\nTectosages[1079]; and there is the spot where Rhoda[1080], a Rhodian\r\ncolony, formerly stood, from which the river takes its name of\r\nRhodanus[1081]; a stream by far the most fertilizing of any in either\r\nof the Gallias. Descending from the Alps and rushing through lake\r\nLemanus[1082], it carries along with it the sluggish Arar[1083], as\r\nwell as the torrents of the Isara and the Druentia[1084], no less rapid\r\nthan itself. Its two smaller mouths are called Libica[1085], one being\r\nthe Spanish, and the other the Metapinian mouth; the third and largest\r\nis called the Massiliotic[1086]. There are some authors who state that\r\nthere was formerly a town called Heraclea[1087] at the mouth of the\r\nRhodanus or Rhone.\r\n\r\nBeyond this are the Canals[1088] leading out of the Rhone, a famous\r\nwork of Caius Marius, and still distinguished by his name; the Lake of\r\nMastramela[1089], the town of Maritima[1090] of the Avatici, and, above\r\nthis, the Stony Plains[1091], memorable for the battles of Hercules;\r\nthe district of the Anatilii[1092], and more inland, that of the\r\nDesuviates[1093] and the Cavari. Again, close upon the sea, there is\r\nthat of the Tricorii[1094], and inland, there are the Tricolli[1095],\r\nthe Vocontii[1096], and the Segovellauni, and, after them, the\r\nAllobroges[1097].\r\n\r\nOn the coast is Massilia, a colony of Phocæan[1098] Greeks, and a\r\nfederate[1099] city; we then have the Promontory of Zao[1100], the\r\nport of Citharista[1101], and the district of the Camatullici[1102];\r\nthen the Suelteri[1103], and above them the Verrucini[1104]. Again,\r\non the coast, we find Athenopolis[1105], belonging to the Massilians,\r\nForum Julii[1106] Octavanorum, a colony, which is also called Pacensis\r\nand Classica, the river Argenteus[1107], which flows through it, the\r\ndistrict of the Oxubii[1108] and that of the Ligauni[1109]; above whom\r\nare the Suetri[1110], the Quariates[1111] and the Adunicates[1112].\r\nOn the coast we have Antipolis[1113], a town with Latian rights, the\r\ndistrict of the Deciates, and the river Varus, which proceeds from\r\nMount Cema, one of the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe colonies in the interior are Arelate Sextanorum[1114], Beterræ\r\nSeptimanorum[1115], and Arausio[1116] Secundanorum; Valentia[1117]\r\nin the territory of the Cavari, and Vienna[1118] in that of the\r\nAllobroges. The towns that enjoy Latian rights are Aquæ Sextiæ[1119] in\r\nthe territory of the Saluvii, Avenio[1120] in that of the Cavari, Apta\r\nJulia[1121] in that of the Volgientes, Alebece[1122] in that of the\r\nReii Apollinares, Alba[1123] in that of the Helvi, and Augusta[1124]\r\nin that of the Tricastini, Anatilia, Aeria[1125], the Bormanni[1126],\r\nthe Comaci, Cabellio[1127], Carcasum[1128] in the territory of\r\nthe Volcæ Tectosages, Cessero[1129], Carpentoracte[1130] in the\r\nterritory of the Memini, the Cenicenses[1131], the Cambolectri[1132],\r\nsurnamed the Atlantici, Forum[1133] Voconi, Glanum Livi[1134], the\r\nLutevani[1135], also called the Foroneronienses[1136], Nemausum[1137]\r\nin the territory of the Arecomici, Piscenæ[1138], the Ruteni[1139],\r\nthe Sanagenses[1140], the Tolosani[1141] in the territory of the\r\nTectosages on the confines of Aquitania, the Tasconi[1142], the\r\nTarusconienses[1143], the Umbranici[1144], Vasio[1145] and Lucus\r\nAugusti[1146], the two capitals of the federate state of the Vocontii.\r\nThere are also nineteen towns of less note, as well as twenty-four\r\nbelonging to the people of Nemausum. To this list[1147] the Emperor\r\nGalba added two tribes dwelling among the Alps, the Avantici[1148] and\r\nthe Bodiontici, to whom belongs the town of Dinia[1149]. According to\r\nAgrippa the length of the province of Gallia Narbonensis is 370 miles,\r\nand its breadth 248[1150].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6. (5.)—OF ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext comes Italy, and we begin with the Ligures[1151], after whom\r\nwe have Etruria, Umbria, Latium, where the mouths of the Tiber are\r\nsituate, and Rome, the Capital of the world, sixteen miles distant from\r\nthe sea. We then come to the coasts of the Volsci and of Campania, and\r\nthe districts of Picenum, of Lucania, and of Bruttium, where Italy\r\nextends the farthest in a southerly direction, and projects into the\r\n[two] seas with the chain of the Alps[1152], which there forms pretty\r\nnearly the shape of a crescent. Leaving Bruttium we come to the coast\r\nof [Magna] Græcia, then the Salentini, the Pediculi, the Apuli, the\r\nPeligni, the Frentani, the Marrucini, the Vestini, the Sabini, the\r\nPicentes, the Galli, the Umbri, the Tusci, the Veneti, the Carni, the\r\nIapydes, the Histri, and the Liburni.\r\n\r\nI am by no means unaware that I might be justly accused of ingratitude\r\nand indolence, were I to describe thus briefly and in so cursory a\r\nmanner the land which is at once the foster-child[1153] and the parent\r\nof all lands; chosen by the providence of the Gods to render even\r\nheaven itself more glorious[1154], to unite the scattered empires\r\nof the earth, to bestow a polish upon men’s manners, to unite the\r\ndiscordant and uncouth dialects of so many different nations by the\r\npowerful ties of one common language, to confer the enjoyments of\r\ndiscourse and of civilization upon mankind, to become, in short, the\r\nmother-country of all nations of the Earth.\r\n\r\nBut how shall I commence this undertaking? So vast is the number of\r\ncelebrated places (what man living could enumerate them all?), and\r\nso great the renown attached to each individual nation and subject,\r\nthat I feel myself quite at a loss. The city of Rome alone, which\r\nforms a portion of it, a face well worthy of shoulders so beauteous,\r\nhow large a work would it require for an appropriate description! And\r\nthen too the coast of Campania, taken singly by itself! so blest with\r\nnatural beauties and opulence, that it is evident that when nature\r\nformed it she took a delight in accumulating all her blessings in\r\na single spot—how am I to do justice to it? And then the climate,\r\nwith its eternal freshness and so replete with health and vitality,\r\nthe sereneness of the weather so enchanting, the fields so fertile,\r\nthe hill sides so sunny, the thickets so free from every danger, the\r\ngroves so cool and shady, the forests with a vegetation so varying\r\nand so luxuriant, the breezes descending from so many a mountain, the\r\nfruitfulness of its grain, its vines, and its olives so transcendent;\r\nits flocks with fleeces so noble, its bulls with necks so sinewy,\r\nits lakes recurring in never-ending succession, its numerous rivers\r\nand springs which refresh it with their waters on every side, its\r\nseas so many in number, its havens and the bosom of its lands opening\r\neverywhere to the commerce of all the world, and as it were eagerly\r\nstretching forth into the very midst of the waves, for the purpose of\r\naiding as it were the endeavours of mortals!\r\n\r\nFor the present I forbear to speak of its genius, its manners, its men,\r\nand the nations whom it has conquered by eloquence and force of arms.\r\nThe very Greeks themselves, a race fond in the extreme of expatiating\r\non their own praises, have amply given judgment in its favour, when\r\nthey named but a small part of it ‘Magna Græcia[1155].’ But we must be\r\ncontent to do on this occasion as we have done in our description of\r\nthe heavens; we must only touch upon some of these points, and take\r\nnotice of but a few of its stars. I only beg my readers to bear in\r\nmind that I am thus hastening on for the purpose of giving a general\r\ndescription of everything that is known to exist throughout the whole\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nI may premise by observing that this land very much resembles in shape\r\nan oak leaf, being much longer than it is broad; towards the top it\r\ninclines to the left[1156], while it terminates in the form of an\r\nAmazonian buckler[1157], in which the spot at the central projection\r\nis the place called Cocinthos, while it sends forth two horns at the\r\nend of its crescent-shaped bays, Leucopetra on the right and Lacinium\r\non the left. It extends in length 1020 miles, if we measure from the\r\nfoot of the Alps at Prætoria Augusta, through the city of Rome and\r\nCapua to the town of Rhegium, which is situate on the shoulder of the\r\nPeninsula, just at the bend of the neck as it were. The distance would\r\nbe much greater if measured to Lacinium, but in that case the line,\r\nbeing drawn obliquely, would incline too much to one side. Its breadth\r\nis variable; being 410 miles between the two seas, the Lower and the\r\nUpper[1158], and the rivers Varus and Arsia[1159]: at about the middle,\r\nand in the vicinity of the city of Rome, from the spot where the river\r\nAternus[1160] flows into the Adriatic sea, to the mouth of the Tiber,\r\nthe distance is 136 miles, and a little less from Castrum-novum on the\r\nAdriatic sea to Alsium[1161] on the Tuscan; but in no place does it\r\nexceed 200 miles in breadth. The circuit of the whole, from the Varus\r\nto the Arsia, is 3059 miles[1162].\r\n\r\nAs to its distance from the countries that surround it—Istria and\r\nLiburnia are, in some places[1163], 100 miles from it, and Epirus\r\nand Illyricum 50; Africa is less than 200, as we are informed by M.\r\nVarro; Sardinia[1164] is 120, Sicily 1-1/2, Corsica less than 80, and\r\nIssa[1165] 50. It extends into the two seas towards the southern parts\r\nof the heavens, or, to speak with more minute exactness, between the\r\nsixth[1166] hour and the first hour of the winter solstice.\r\n\r\nWe will now describe its extent and its different cities; in doing\r\nwhich, it is necessary to premise, that we shall follow the arrangement\r\nof the late Emperor Augustus, and adopt the division which he made\r\nof the whole of Italy into eleven districts; taking them, however,\r\naccording to their order on the sea-line, as in so hurried a detail it\r\nwould not be possible otherwise to describe each city in juxtaposition\r\nwith the others in its vicinity. And for the same reason, in describing\r\nthe interior, I shall follow the alphabetical order which has been\r\nadopted by that Emperor, pointing out the colonies of which he has\r\nmade mention in his enumeration. Nor is it a very easy task to trace\r\ntheir situation and origin; for, not to speak of others, the Ingaunian\r\nLigurians have had lands granted to them as many as thirty different\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7.—OF THE NINTH[1167] REGION OF ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo begin then with the river Varus; we have the town of Nicæa[1168],\r\nfounded by the Massilians, the river Paulo[1169], the Alps and\r\nthe Alpine tribes, distinguished by various names[1170], but more\r\nespecially the Capillati[1171], Cemenelio[1172], a town of the state\r\nof the Vediantii, the port of Hercules Monæcus[1173], and the Ligurian\r\ncoast. The more celebrated of the Ligurian tribes beyond the Alps are\r\nthe Salluvii, the Deciates, and the Oxubii[1174]; on this side of the\r\nAlps, the Veneni[1175], and the Vagienni, who are derived from the\r\nCaturiges[1176], the Statielli[1177], the Bimbelli[1178], the Magelli,\r\nthe Euburiates, the Casmonates[1179], the Veleiates[1180], and the\r\npeoples whose towns we shall describe as lying near the adjoining\r\ncoast. The river Rutuba[1181], the town of Albium Intemelium[1182],\r\nthe river Merula[1183], the town of Albium Ingaunum[1184], the port of\r\nVadum Sabatiorum[1185], the river Porcifera[1186], the town of Genua,\r\nthe river Feritor[1187], the Portus Delphini[1188], Tigullia[1189],\r\nTegesta[1190] of the Tigullii, and the river Macra[1191], which is the\r\nboundary of Liguria.\r\n\r\nExtending behind all the before-mentioned places are the Apennines, the\r\nmost considerable of all the mountains of Italy, the chain of which\r\nextends unbroken from the Alps[1192] to the Sicilian sea. On the other\r\nside of the Apennines, towards the Padus[1193], the richest river of\r\nItaly, the whole country is adorned with noble towns; Libarna[1194],\r\nthe colony of Dertona[1195], Iria[1196], Barderate[1197],\r\nIndustria[1198], Pollentia[1199], Carrea surnamed Potentia[1200],\r\nForo Fulvî or Valentinum[1201], Augusta[1202] of the Vagienni, Alba\r\nPompeia[1203], Asta[1204], and Aquæ Statiellorum[1205]. This is the\r\nninth region, according to the arrangement of Augustus. The coast of\r\nLiguria extends 211 miles[1206], between the rivers Varus and Macra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8.—THE SEVENTH REGION OF ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to this comes the seventh region, in which is Etruria, a district\r\nwhich begins at the river Macra, and has often changed its name. At\r\nan early period the Umbri were expelled from it by the Pelasgi; and\r\nthese again by the Lydians, who from a king of theirs[1207] were named\r\nTyrrheni, but afterwards, from the rites observed in their sacrifices,\r\nwere called, in the Greek language[1208], Tusci. The first town in\r\nEtruria is Luna[1209], with a noble harbour, then the colony of\r\nLuca[1210], at some distance from the sea, and nearer to it again the\r\ncolony of Pisæ[1211], between the rivers Auser[1212] and Arnus[1213],\r\nwhich owes its origin to Pelops and the Pisans[1214], or else to the\r\nTeutani, a people of Greece. Next is Vada[1215] Volaterrana, then the\r\nriver Cecinna[1216], and Populonium[1217] formerly belonging to the\r\nEtrurians, the only town they had on this coast. Next to these is the\r\nriver Prile[1218], then the Umbro[1219], which is navigable, and where\r\nthe district of Umbria begins, the port of Telamon[1220], Cosa[1221] of\r\nthe Volcientes, founded by the Roman people, Graviscæ[1222], Castrum\r\nnovum[1223], Pyrgi[1224], the river Cæretanus[1225], and Cære[1226]\r\nitself, four miles inland, called Agylla by the Pelasgi who founded it,\r\nAlsium[1227], Fregenæ[1228], and the river Tiber, 284[1229] miles from\r\nthe Macra.\r\n\r\nIn the interior we have the colonies of Falisci[1230], founded\r\nby the Argives, according to the account of Cato[1231], and\r\nsurnamed Falisci Etruscorum, Lucus Feroniæ[1232], Rusellana, the\r\nSenienses[1233], and Sutrina[1234]. The remaining peoples are\r\nthe Arretini[1235] Veteres, the Arretini Fidentes, the Arretini\r\nJulienses, the Amitinenses, the Aquenses, surnamed Taurini[1236],\r\nthe Blerani[1237], the Cortonenses[1238], the Capenates[1239], the\r\nClusini Novi, the Clusini Veteres[1240], the Florentini[1241],\r\nsituate on the stream of the Arnus, Fæsulæ[1242], Ferentinum[1243],\r\nFescennia[1244], Hortanum[1245], Herbanum[1246], Nepeta[1247],\r\nNovem Pagi[1248], the Claudian præfecture of Foroclodium[1249],\r\nPistorium[1250], Perusia[1251], the Suanenses, the Saturnini, formerly\r\ncalled the Aurinini, the Subertani[1252], the Statones[1253], the\r\nTarquinienses[1254], the Tuscanienses[1255], the Vetulonienses[1256],\r\nthe Veientani[1257], the Vesentini[1258], the Volaterrani[1259], the\r\nVolcentini[1260], surnamed Etrusci, and the Volsinienses[1261]. In the\r\nsame district the territories of Crustumerium[1262] and Caletra[1263]\r\nretain the names of the ancient towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9.—THE FIRST REGION OF ITALY[1264]; THE TIBER; ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tiber or Tiberis, formerly called Thybris, and previously\r\nAlbula[1265], flows down from nearly the central part of the chain\r\nof the Apennines, in the territory of the Arretini. It is at first\r\nsmall, and only navigable by means of sluices, in which the water is\r\ndammed up and then discharged, in the same manner as the Timia[1266]\r\nand the Glanis, which flow into it; for which purpose it is found\r\nnecessary to collect the water for nine days, unless there should\r\nhappen to be a fall of rain. And even then, the Tiber, by reason of\r\nits rugged and uneven channel, is really more suitable for navigation\r\nby rafts than by vessels, for any great distance. It winds along for\r\na course of 150 miles, passing not far from Tifernum[1267], Perusia,\r\nand Ocriculum[1268], and dividing Etruria from the Umbri[1269] and the\r\nSabini[1270], and then, at a distance of less than sixteen miles from\r\nthe city, separating the territory of Veii from that of Crustuminum,\r\nand afterwards that of the Fidenates and of Latium from Vaticanum.\r\n\r\nBelow its union with the Glanis from Arretinum the Tiber is swollen by\r\ntwo and forty streams, particularly the Nar[1271] and the Anio, which\r\nlast is also navigable and shuts in Latium at the back; it is also\r\nincreased by the numerous aqueducts and springs which are conveyed to\r\nthe City. Here it becomes navigable by vessels of any burden which\r\nmay come up from the Italian sea; a most tranquil dispenser of the\r\nproduce of all parts of the earth, and peopled and embellished along\r\nits banks with more villas than nearly all the other rivers of the\r\nworld taken together. And yet there is no river more circumscribed\r\nthan it, so close are its banks shut in on either side; but still, no\r\nresistance does it offer, although its waters frequently rise with\r\ngreat suddenness, and no part is more liable to be swollen than that\r\nwhich runs through the City itself. In such case, however, the Tiber is\r\nrather to be looked upon[1272] as pregnant with prophetic warnings to\r\nus, and in its increase to be considered more as a promoter of religion\r\nthan a source of devastation.\r\n\r\nLatium[1273] has preserved its original limits, from the Tiber to\r\nCirceii[1274], a distance of fifty miles: so slender at the beginning\r\nwere the roots from which this our Empire sprang. Its inhabitants have\r\nbeen often changed, and different nations have peopled it at different\r\ntimes, the Aborigines, the Pelasgi, the Arcades, the Seculi, the\r\nAurunci, the Rutuli, and, beyond Circeii, the Volsci, the Osci, and the\r\nAusones whence the name of Latium came to be extended as far as the\r\nriver Liris[1275].\r\n\r\nWe will begin with Ostia[1276], a colony founded by a king of Rome,\r\nthe town of Laurentum[1277], the grove of Jupiter Indiges[1278], the\r\nriver Numicius[1279], and Ardea[1280], founded by Danaë, the mother of\r\nPerseus. Next come the former site of Aphrodisium[1281], the colony\r\nof Antium[1282], the river and island called Astura[1283], the river\r\nNymphæus[1284], the Clostra Romana[1285], and Circeii[1286], formerly\r\nan island, and, if we are to believe Homer, surrounded by the open\r\nsea, though now by an extensive plain. The circumstances which we are\r\nenabled to publish on this subject for the information of the world\r\nare very remarkable. Theophrastus, the first foreigner who treated\r\nof the affairs of Rome with any degree of accuracy (for Theopompus,\r\nbefore whose time no Greek writer had made mention of us, only stated\r\nthe fact that the city had been taken by the Gauls, and Clitarchus,\r\nthe next after him, only spoke of the embassy that was sent by the\r\nRomans to Alexander)—Theophrastus, I say, following something more than\r\nmere rumour, has given the circuit of the island of Circeii as being\r\neighty stadia, in the volume which he wrote during the archonship of\r\nNicodorus at Athens[1287], being the 440th year of our city. Whatever\r\nland therefore has been annexed to that island beyond the circumference\r\nof about ten miles, has been added to Italy since the year previously\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nAnother wonderful circumstance too.—Near Circeii are the Pomptine\r\nMarshes[1288], formerly the site, according to Mucianus, who was\r\nthrice consul, of four-and-twenty cities. Next to this comes the river\r\nUfens[1289], upon which is the town of Terracina[1290], called, in the\r\nlanguage of the Volsci, Anxur; the spot too where Amyclæ[1291] stood,\r\na town destroyed by serpents. Next is the site of the Grotto[1292],\r\nLake Fundanus[1293], the port of Caieta[1294], and then the town\r\nof Formiæ[1295], formerly called Hormiæ, the ancient seat of the\r\nLæstrygones[1296], it is supposed. Beyond this, formerly stood the\r\ntown of Pyræ; and we then come to the colony of Minturnæ[1297], which\r\nstill exists, and is divided[1298] by the river Liris, also called the\r\nGlanis. The town of Sinuessa[1299] is the last in the portion which\r\nhas been added to Latium; it is said by some that it used to be called\r\nSinope.\r\n\r\nAt this spot begins that blessed country Campania[1300], and in this\r\nvale first take their rise those hills clad with vines, the juice of\r\nwhose grape is extolled by Fame all over the world; the happy spot\r\nwhere, as the ancients used to say, father Liber and Ceres are ever\r\nstriving for the mastery. Hence the fields of Setia[1301] and of\r\nCæcubum[1302] extend afar, and, next to them those of Falernum[1303]\r\nand of Calinum[1304]. As soon as we have passed these, the hills of\r\nMassica[1305], of Gaurus[1306], and of Surrentum rise to our view.\r\nNext, the level plains of Laborium[1307] are spread out far and wide,\r\nwhere every care is bestowed on cultivating crops of spelt, from which\r\nthe most delicate fermenty is made. These shores are watered by warm\r\nsprings[1308], while the seas are distinguished beyond all others\r\nfor the superlative excellence of their shell and other fish. In no\r\ncountry too has the oil of the olive a more exquisite flavour. This\r\nterritory, a battle-ground as it were for the gratification of every\r\nluxurious pleasure of man, has been held successively by the Osci, the\r\nGreeks, the Umbri, the Tusci, and the Campani.\r\n\r\nOn the coast we first meet with the river Savo[1309], the town\r\nof Volturnum with a river[1310] of the same name, the town of\r\nLiternum[1311], Cumæ[1312], a Chalcidian colony, Misenum[1313],\r\nthe port of Baiæ[1314], Bauli[1315], the Lucrine Lake[1316], and\r\nLake Avernus, near which there stood formerly a town[1317] of the\r\nCimmerians. We then come to Puteoli[1318], formerly called the colony\r\nof Dicæarchia, then the Phlegræan[1319] Plains, and the Marsh of\r\nAcherusia[1320] in the vicinity of Cumæ.\r\n\r\nAgain, on the coast we have Neapolis[1321], also a colony of the\r\nChalcidians, and called Parthenope from the tomb there of one of the\r\nSirens, Herculaneum[1322], Pompeii[1323], from which Mount Vesuvius\r\nmay be seen at no great distance, and which is watered by the river\r\nSarnus[1324]; the territory of Nuceria, and, at the distance of\r\nnine miles from the sea, the town of that name[1325], and then\r\nSurrentum[1326], with the Promontory of Minerva[1327], formerly\r\nthe abode of the Sirens. The distance thence by sea to Circeii is\r\nseventy-eight miles. This region, beginning at the Tiber, is looked\r\nupon as the first of Italy according to the division of Augustus.\r\n\r\nInland there are the following colonies:—Capua[1328], so called from\r\nits champaign country, Aquinum[1329], Suessa[1330], Venafrum[1331],\r\nSora[1332], Teanum surnamed Sidicinum[1333], Nola[1334]; and the towns\r\nof Abelia[1335], Aricia[1336], Alba Longa[1337], the Acerrani[1338],\r\nthe Allifani[1339], the Atinates[1340], the Aletrinates[1341],\r\nthe Anagnini[1342], the Atellani[1343], the Affilani[1344], the\r\nArpinates[1345], the Auximates[1346], the Abellani[1347], the Alfaterni\r\n(both those who take their names from the Latin, the Hernican and the\r\nLabicanian territory), Bovillæ[1348], Calatia[1349], Casinum[1350],\r\nCalenum[1351], Capitulum[1352] of the Hernici, the Cereatini[1353],\r\nsurnamed Mariani, the Corani[1354], descended from the Trojan Dardanus,\r\nthe Cubulterini, the Castrimœnienses[1355], the Cingulani[1356], the\r\nFabienses[1357] on the Alban Mount, the Foropopulienses[1358] of the\r\nFalernian district, the Frusinates[1359], the Ferentinates[1360],\r\nthe Freginates[1361], the old Frabaterni[1362], the new Frabaterni,\r\nthe Ficolenses[1363], the Fregellani[1364], Forum Appî[1365], the\r\nForentani[1366], the Gabini[1367], the Interamnates Succasini[1368],\r\nalso surnamed Lirinates, the Ilionenses Lavinii[1369], the\r\nNorbani[1370], the Nomentani[1371], the Prænestini[1372] (whose city\r\nwas formerly called Stephané), the Privernates[1373], the Setini[1374],\r\nthe Signini[1375], the Suessulani[1376], the Telesini[1377], the\r\nTrebulani, surnamed Balinienses[1378], the Trebani[1379], the\r\nTusculani[1380], the Verulani[1381], the Veliterni[1382], the\r\nUlubrenses[1383], the Urbinates[1384], and, last and greater than\r\nall, Rome herself, whose other name[1385] the hallowed mysteries of\r\nthe sacred rites forbid us to mention without being guilty of the\r\ngreatest impiety. After it had been long kept buried in secresy with\r\nthe strictest fidelity and in respectful and salutary silence, Valerius\r\nSoranus dared to divulge it, but soon did he pay the penalty[1386] of\r\nhis rashness.\r\n\r\nIt will not perhaps be altogether foreign to the purpose, if I here\r\nmake mention of one peculiar institution of our forefathers which bears\r\nespecial reference to the inculcation of silence on religious matters.\r\nThe goddess Angerona[1387], to whom sacrifice is offered on the twelfth\r\nday before the calends of January [21st December], is represented in\r\nher statue as having her mouth bound with a sealed fillet.\r\n\r\nRomulus left the city of Rome, if we are to believe those who state\r\nthe very greatest number, having three[1388] gates and no more. When\r\nthe Vespasians were emperors[1389] and censors, in the year from its\r\nbuilding 826, the circumference of the walls which surrounded it was\r\nthirteen miles and two-fifths. Surrounding as it does the Seven Hills,\r\nthe city is divided into fourteen districts, with 265 cross-roads[1390]\r\nunder the guardianship of the Lares. If a straight line is drawn from\r\nthe mile-column[1391] placed at the entrance of the Forum, to each of\r\nthe gates, which are at present thirty-seven in number (taking care\r\nto count only once the twelve double gates, and to omit the seven\r\nold ones, which no longer exist), the result will be [taking them\r\naltogether], a straight line of twenty miles and 765 paces[1392].\r\nBut if we draw a straight line from the same mile-column to the very\r\nlast of the houses, including therein the Prætorian encampment, and\r\nfollow throughout the line of all the streets, the result will then be\r\nsomething more than seventy miles. Add to these calculations the height\r\nof the houses, and then a person may form a fair idea of this city, and\r\nwill certainly be obliged to admit that there is not a place throughout\r\nthe whole world that for size can be compared to it. On the eastern\r\nside it is bounded by the _agger_ of Tarquinius Superbus, a work of\r\nsurpassing grandeur; for he raised it so high as to be on a level with\r\nthe walls on the side on which the city lay most exposed to attack from\r\nthe neighbouring plains. On all the other sides it has been fortified\r\neither with lofty walls or steep and precipitous hills[1393], but so\r\nit is, that its buildings, increasing and extending beyond all bounds,\r\nhave now united many other cities to it[1394].\r\n\r\nBesides those previously mentioned, there were formerly in the\r\nfirst region the following famous towns of Latium: Satricum[1395],\r\nPometia[1396], Scaptia, Politorium[1397], Tellene, Tifata,\r\nCænina[1398], Ficana[1399], Crustumerium, Ameriola[1400],\r\nMedullum[1401], Corniculum[1402], Saturnia[1403], on the site of the\r\npresent city of Rome, Antipolis[1404], now Janiculum, forming part of\r\nRome, Antemnæ[1405], Camerium[1406], Collatia[1407], Amitinum[1408],\r\nNorbe, Sulmo[1409], and, with these, those Alban nations[1410] who used\r\nto take part in the sacrifices[1411] upon the Alban Mount, the Albani,\r\nthe Æsulani[1412], the Accienses, the Abolani, the Bubetani[1413], the\r\nBolani[1414], the Cusuetani, the Coriolani[1415], the Fidenates[1416],\r\nthe Foretii, the Hortenses[1417], the Latinienses, the Longulani[1418],\r\nthe Manates, the Macrales, the Mutucumenses, the Munienses, the\r\nNuminienses, the Olliculani, the Octulani, the Pedani[1419], the\r\nPolluscini, the Querquetulani, the Sicani, the Sisolenses, the\r\nTolerienses, the Tutienses, the Vimitellarii, the Velienses, the\r\nVenetulani, and the Vitellenses. Thus we see, fifty-three peoples of\r\nancient Latium have passed away without leaving any traces of their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIn the Campanian territory there was also the town of Stabiæ[1420],\r\nuntil the consulship of Cneius Pompeius and L. Cato, when, on the day\r\nbefore the calends of May [30th of April], it was destroyed in the\r\nSocial War by L. Sulla the legatus, and all that now stands on its site\r\nis a single farmhouse. Here also Taurania has ceased to exist, and the\r\nremains of Casilinum[1421] are fast going to ruin. Besides these, we\r\nlearn from Antias that king L. Tarquinius took Apiolæ[1422], a town\r\nof the Latins, and with its spoils laid the first foundations of the\r\nCapitol. From Surrentum[1423] to the river Silarus[1424], the former\r\nterritory of Picentia[1425] extends for a distance of thirty miles.\r\nThis belonged to the Etruscans, and was remarkable for the temple\r\nof the Argive Juno, founded by Jason[1426]. In it was Picentia, a\r\ntown[1427] of the territory of Salernum[1428].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10.—THE THIRD REGION OF ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Silarus begins the third region of Italy, consisting of the\r\nterritory of Lucania and Bruttium; here too there have been no few\r\nchanges of the population. These districts have been possessed by\r\ntbe Pelasgi, the Œnotrii, the Itali, the Morgetes, the Siculi, and\r\nmore especially by people who emigrated from Greece[1429], and, last\r\nof all, by the Leucani, a people sprung from the Samnites, who took\r\npossession under the command of Lucius. We find here the town of\r\nPæstum[1430], which received from the Greeks the name of Posidonia,\r\nthe Gulf of Pæstum[1431], the town of Elea, now known as Velia[1432],\r\nand the Promontory of Palinurum[1433], a point at which the land\r\nfalls inwards and forms a bay[1434], the distance across which to the\r\npillar[1435] of Rhegium is 100 miles. Next after Palinurum comes the\r\nriver Melpes[1436], then the town of Buxentum[1437], called in [Magna]\r\nGræcia Pyxus, and the river Laus; there was formerly a town[1438] also\r\nof the same name.\r\n\r\nAt this spot begins the coast of Bruttium, and we come to the town\r\nof Blanda[1439], the river Batum[1440], Parthenius, a port of the\r\nPhocians, the bay of Vibo[1441], the place[1442] where Clampetia\r\nformerly stood, the town of Temsa[1443], called Temese by the Greeks,\r\nand Terina founded by the people of Crotona[1444], with the extensive\r\nGulf of Terina; more inland, the town of Consentia[1445]. Situate upon\r\na peninsula[1446] is the river Acheron[1447], from which the people of\r\nAcherontia derive the name of their town; then Hippo, now called Vibo\r\nValentia, the Port of Hercules[1448], the river Metaurus[1449], the\r\ntown of Tauroentum[1450], the Port of Orestes, and Medma[1451]. Next,\r\nthe town of Scyllæum[1452], the river Cratæis[1453], the mother of\r\nScylla it is said; then the Pillar of Rhegium, the Straits of Sicily,\r\nand the two promontories which face each other, Cænys[1454] on the\r\nItalian, and Pelorus[1455] on the Sicilian side, the distance between\r\nthem being twelve stadia. At a distance thence of twelve miles and a\r\nhalf, we come to Rhegium[1456], after which begins Sila[1457], a forest\r\nof the Apennines, and then the promontory of Leucopetra[1458], at a\r\ndistance of fifteen miles; after which come the Locri[1459], who take\r\ntheir surname from the promontory of Zephyrium[1460], being distant\r\nfrom the river Silarus 303 miles.\r\n\r\nAt this spot ends the first[1461] great Gulf of Europe; the seas in\r\nwhich bear the following names:—That from which it takes its rise is\r\ncalled the Atlantic, by some the Great Atlantic, the entrance of which\r\nis, by the Greeks, called Porthmos, by us the Straits of Gades. After\r\nits entrance, as far as it washes the coasts of Spain, it is called\r\nthe Hispanian Sea, though some give it the name of the Iberian or\r\nBalearic[1462] Sea. Where it faces the province of Gallia Narbonensis\r\nit has the name of the Gallic, and after that, of the Ligurian, Sea.\r\nFrom Liguria to the island of Sicily, it is called the Tuscan Sea,\r\nthe same which is called by some of the Greeks the Notian[1463], by\r\nothers the Tyrrhenian, while many of our people call it the Lower\r\nSea. Beyond Sicily, as far as the country of the Salentini, it is\r\nstyled by Polybius the Ausonian Sea. Eratosthenes however gives to\r\nthe whole expanse that lies between the inlet of the ocean and the\r\nisland of Sardinia, the name of the Sardoan Sea; thence to Sicily, the\r\nTyrrhenian; thence to Crete, the Sicilian; and beyond that island, the\r\nCretan Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11.—SIXTY-FOUR ISLANDS, AMONG WHICH ARE THE BALEARES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first islands that we meet with in all these seas are the two\r\nto which the Greeks have given the name of Pityussæ[1464], from the\r\npine-tree[1465], which they produce. These islands now bear the name\r\nof Ebusus, and form a federate state. They are separated by a narrow\r\nstrait[1466] of the sea, and are forty-six[1467] miles in extent.\r\nThey are distant from Dianium[1468] 700 stadia, Dianium being by land\r\nthe same distance[1469] from New Carthage. At the same distance[1470]\r\nfrom the Pityussæ, lie, in the open sea, the two Baleares, and, over\r\nagainst the river Sucro[1471], Colubraria[1472]. The Baleares[1473],\r\nso formidable in war with their slingers[1474], have received from the\r\nGreeks the name of Gymnasiæ.\r\n\r\nThe larger island is 100[1475] miles in length, and 475 in\r\ncircumference. It has the following towns; Palma[1476] and\r\nPollentia[1477], enjoying the rights of Roman citizens, Cinium[1478]\r\nand Tucis, with Latin rights: Bocchorum, a federate town, is no longer\r\nin existence. At thirty miles’ distance is the smaller island, 40\r\nmiles in length, and 150[1479] in circumference; it contains the states\r\nof Jamnon[1480], Sanisera, and Magon[1481].\r\n\r\nIn the open sea, at twelve miles’ distance from the larger island,\r\nis Capraria[1482] with its treacherous coast, so notorious for its\r\nnumerous shipwrecks; and, opposite to the city of Palma, are the\r\nislands known as the Mænariæ[1483], Tiquadra[1484], and Little\r\nHannibalis[1485].\r\n\r\nThe earth of Ebusus has the effect of driving away serpents, while\r\nthat of Colubraria produces them; hence the latter spot is dangerous\r\nto all persons who have not brought with them some of the earth of\r\nEbusus. The Greeks have given it the name of Ophiusa[1486]. Ebusus too\r\nproduces no[1487] rabbits to destroy the harvests of the Baleares.\r\nThere are also about twenty other small islands in this sea, which is\r\nfull of shoals. Off the coast of Gaul, at the mouth of the Rhodanus,\r\nthere is Metina[1488], and near it the island which is known as\r\nBlascon[1489], with the three Stœchades, so called by their neighbours\r\nthe Massilians[1490], on account of the regular order in which they\r\nare placed; their respective names are Prote[1491], Mese[1492], also\r\ncalled Pomponiana, and Hypæa[1493]. After these come Sturium[1494],\r\nPhœnice, Phila, Lero, and, opposite to Antipolis[1495], Lerina[1496],\r\nwhere there is a remembrance of a town called Vergoanum having once\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (6.)—CORSICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Ligurian Sea, but close to the Tuscan, is Corsica, by the Greeks\r\ncalled Cyrnos, extending, from north to south 150 miles, and for the\r\nmost part 50 miles in breadth, its circumference being 325. It is 62\r\nmiles distant from the Vada Volaterrana[1497]. It contains thirty-two\r\nstates, and two colonies, that of Mariana[1498], founded by C. Marius,\r\nand that of Aleria, founded by the Dictator Sylla. On this side of\r\nit is Oglasa[1499], and, at a distance of less than sixty miles from\r\nCorsica, Planaria[1500], so called from its appearance, being nearly\r\nlevel with the sea, and consequently treacherous to mariners.\r\n\r\nWe next have Urgo[1501], a larger island, and Capraria, which the\r\nGreeks have called Ægilion[1502]; then Igilium[1503] and Dianium[1504],\r\nwhich they have also called Artemisia, both of them opposite the\r\ncoast of Cosa; also Barpana[1505], Mænaria, Columbaria, and\r\nVenaria. We then come to Ilva[1506] with its iron mines, an island\r\n100 miles in circumference, 10 miles distant from Populonium, and\r\ncalled Æthalia by the Greeks: from it the island of Planasia[1507]\r\nis distant 28 miles. After these, beyond the mouths of the Tiber,\r\nand off the coast of Antium, we come to Astura[1508], then Palmaria\r\nand Sinonia, and, opposite to Formiæ, Pontiæ. In the Gulf of Puteoli\r\nare Pandateria[1509], and Prochyta, so called, not from the nurse of\r\nÆneas, but because it has been poured forth[1510] or detached from\r\nÆnaria[1511], an island which received its name from having been the\r\nanchorage of the fleet of Æneas, though called by Homer Inarime[1512];\r\nit is also called Pithecusa, not, as many have fancied, on account\r\nof the multitudes of apes found there, but from its extensive\r\nmanufactories of pottery. Between Pausilipum[1513] and Neapolis lies\r\nthe island of Megaris[1514], and then, at a distance of eight miles\r\nfrom Surrentum, Capreæ[1515], famous for the castle of the emperor\r\nTiberius: it is eleven miles in circumference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—SARDINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeucothea comes next, and after it, but out of sight, as it lies\r\nupon the verge of the African Sea, Sardinia. It is situate somewhat\r\nless[1516] than eight miles from the nearest point of Corsica, and\r\nthe Straits between them are even still more reduced by the small\r\nislands there situate, called the Cuniculariæ[1517], as also those of\r\nPhintonis[1518] and Fossæ, from which last the Straits themselves have\r\nobtained the name of Taphros[1519].\r\n\r\n(7.) Sardinia extends, upon the east side, a distance of 188 miles, on\r\nthe west 175, on the south 77, and on the north 125, being 565 miles in\r\ncircumference. Its promontory of Caralis[1520] is distant from Africa\r\n200, and from Gades 1400 miles. Off the promontory of Gordis[1521] it\r\nhas two islands called the Isles of Hercules[1522], off that of Sulcis,\r\nthe island of Enosis[1523], and off that of Caralis, Ficaria[1524].\r\nSome writers place Beleris not far from it, as also Callodis, and the\r\nisland known as Heras Lutra[1525].\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated peoples of this island are the Ilienses[1526], the\r\nBalari, and the Corsi; and among its eighteen towns, there are those\r\nof the Sulcitani[1527], the Valentini[1528], the Neapolitani[1529],\r\nthe Bosenses[1530], the Caralitani[1531], who enjoy the rights of\r\nRoman citizens, and the Norenses[1532]. There is also one colony which\r\nis called Ad Turrim Libysonis[1533]. Timæus has called this island\r\nSandaliotis, on account of the similarity of its shape to the sole of a\r\nshoe, while Myrtilus has given it the name of Ichnusa[1534], from its\r\nresemblance to the print of a footstep. Opposite to the Gulf of Pæstum\r\nis Leucasia[1535], so called from a Siren who is buried there; opposite\r\nto Velia are Pontia and Isacia, both known by one name, that of\r\nŒnotrides, a proof that Italy was formerly possessed by the Œnotrians.\r\nOpposite to Vibo are the little islands called Ithacesiæ[1536], from\r\nthe watch-tower of Ulysses situate there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (8.)—SICILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut more celebrated than all is Sicily, called Sicania by\r\nThucydides, and by many writers Trinacria or Trinacia, from its\r\ntriangular appearance. According to Agrippa it is 618[1537] miles in\r\ncircumference. In former times it was a continuation of the territory\r\nof Bruttium, but, in consequence of the overflowing of the sea, became\r\nsevered from it; thus forming a strait of 15 miles in length, and a\r\nmile and a half in width in the vicinity of the Pillar of Rhegium.\r\nIt was from this circumstance of the land being severed asunder that\r\nthe Greeks gave the name of Rhegium[1538] to the town situate on the\r\nItalian shore.\r\n\r\nIn these Straits is the rock of Scylla, as also Charybdis[1539], a\r\nwhirlpool of the sea, both of them noted for their perils. Of this\r\ntriangle, the promontory, which, as we have already[1540] mentioned,\r\nis called Pelorus, faces Scylla and juts out towards Italy, while\r\nPachynum[1541] extends in the direction of Greece, Peloponnesus being\r\nat a distance from it of 440 miles, and Lilybæum[1542], towards Africa,\r\nbeing distant 180 miles from the promontory of Mercury[1543], and from\r\nthat of Caralis in Sardinia 190. These promontories and sides are\r\nsituate at the following distances from each other: by land it is 186\r\nmiles from Pelorus to Pachynum, from Pachynum to Lilybæum 200, and from\r\nLilybæum to Pelorus 170[1544].\r\n\r\nIn this island there are five colonies and sixty-three cities or\r\nstates. Leaving Pelorus and facing the Ionian Sea, we have the town\r\nof Messana[1545], whose inhabitants are also called Mamertini and\r\nenjoy the rights of Roman citizens; the promontory of Drepanum[1546],\r\nthe colony of Tauromenium[1547], formerly called Naxos, the river\r\nAsines[1548], and Mount Ætna, wondrous for the flames which it emits\r\nby night. Its crater is twenty stadia in circumference, and from\r\nit red-hot cinders are thrown as far as Tauromenium and Catina,\r\nthe noise being heard even at Maroneum[1549] and the Gemellian\r\nHills. We then come to the three rocks of the Cyclopes[1550], the\r\nPort of Ulysses[1551], the colony of Catina[1552], and the rivers\r\nSymæthus[1553] and Terias; while more inland lie the Læstrygonian\r\nPlains.\r\n\r\nTo these rivers succeed the towns of Leontinum[1554] and Megaris, the\r\nriver Pantagies[1555], the colony of Syracuse[1556], with the fountain\r\nof Arethusa[1557], (the people in the Syracusan territory drink too\r\nof the fountains of Temenitis[1558], Archidemia, Magæa, Cyane, and\r\nMilichie,) the port of Naustathmus[1559], the river Elorus, and the\r\npromontory of Pachynum. This side[1560] of Sicily begins with the river\r\nHirminius[1561], then follow the town of Camarina[1562], the river\r\nGelas[1563], and the town of Agragas[1564], which our people have named\r\nAgrigentum. We next come to the colony of Thermæ[1565], the rivers\r\nAchates[1566], Mazara, and Hypsa; the town of Selinus[1567], and then\r\nthe Promontory of Lilybæum, which is succeeded by Drepana[1568], Mount\r\nEryx[1569], the towns of Panhormus[1570], Solus[1571] and Himera[1572],\r\nwith a river of the same name, Cephalœdis[1573], Aluntium[1574],\r\nAgathyrnum, the colony of Tyndaris[1575], the town of Mylæ[1576], and\r\nthen Pelorus, the spot at which we began.\r\n\r\nIn the interior there are the following towns enjoying Latin\r\nprivileges, those of the Centuripini[1577], the Netini[1578], and the\r\nSegestani[1579]; tributary towns are those of the Assorini[1580], the\r\nÆtnenses[1581], the Agyrini[1582], the Acestæi, the Acrenses[1583], the\r\nBidini[1584], the Cetarini[1585], the Cacyrini[1586], the Drepanitani,\r\nthe Ergetini[1587], the Echetlienses[1588], the Erycini[1589],\r\nthe Entellini[1590], the Enini[1591], the Enguini[1592], the\r\nGelani[1593], the Galatini[1594], the Halesini[1595], the Hennenses,\r\nthe Hyblenses[1596], the Herbitenses[1597], the Herbessenses[1598],\r\nthe Herbulenses, the Halicyenses[1599], the Hadranitani[1600], the\r\nImacarenses, the Ipanenses, the Ietenses[1601], the Mytistratini[1602],\r\nthe Magellini, the Murgentini[1603], the Mutycenses[1604], the\r\nMenanini[1605], the Naxii[1606], the Noæi[1607], the Petrini[1608],\r\nthe Paropini[1609], the Phthinthienses[1610], the Semellitani, the\r\nScherini, the Selinuntii[1611], the Symæthii, the Talarienses, the\r\nTissinenses[1612], the Triocalini[1613], the Tyracinenses, and the\r\nZanclæi[1614], a Messenian colony on the Straits of Sicily. Towards\r\nAfrica, its islands are Gaulos[1615], Melita, 87 miles from Camerina,\r\nand 113 from Lilybæum, Cosyra[1616], Hieronnesos[1617], Cæne[1618],\r\nGalata[1619], Lopadusa, Æthusa, written by some Ægusa, Bucinna[1620],\r\nOsteodes[1621], distant from Soluntum 75 miles, and, opposite to\r\nParopus, Ustica.\r\n\r\nOn this side of Sicily, facing the river Metaurus, at a distance of\r\nnearly 25[1622] miles from Italy, are the seven[1623] islands called\r\nthe Æolian, as also the Liparæan islands; by the Greeks they are called\r\nthe Hephæstiades, and by our writers the Vulcanian[1624] Isles; they\r\nare called “Æolian” because in the Trojan times Æolus was king there.\r\n\r\n(9.) Lipara[1625], with a town whose inhabitants enjoy the rights\r\nof Roman citizens, is so called from Liparus, a former king who\r\nsucceeded[1626] Æolus, it having been previously called Melogonis\r\nor Meligunis. It is 25 miles[1627] distant from Italy, and in\r\ncircumference a little less. Between this island and Sicily we find\r\nanother, the name of which was formerly Therasia, but now called Hiera,\r\nbecause it is sacred to Vulcan[1628]: it contains a hill which at night\r\nvomits forth flames. The third island is Strongyle[1629], lying one\r\nmile[1630] to the east of Lipara, over which Æolus reigned as well;\r\nit differs only from Lipara in the superior brilliancy of its flames.\r\nFrom the smoke of this volcano it is said that some of the inhabitants\r\nare able to predict three days beforehand what winds are about to\r\nblow; hence arose the notion that the winds are governed by Æolus.\r\nThe fourth of these islands is Didyme[1631], smaller than Lipara, the\r\nfifth Ericusa, the sixth Phœnicusa, left to be a pasture-ground for the\r\ncattle of the neighbouring islands, and the last and smallest Euonymos.\r\nThus much as to the first great Gulf of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15. (10.)—MAGNA GRÆCIA, BEGINNING AT LOCRI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Locri begins the fore-part of Italy, called Magna Græcia, whose\r\ncoast falls back in three bays[1632] formed by the Ausonian sea,\r\nso called from the Ausones, who were the first inhabitants of the\r\ncountry. According to Varro it is 86 miles in extent; but most writers\r\nhave made it only 75. Along this coast there are rivers innumerable,\r\nbut we shall mention those only that are worthy of remark. After\r\nleaving Locri we come to the Sagra[1633], and the ruins of the town of\r\nCaulon, Mystiæ[1634], Consilinum Castrum[1635], Cocinthum[1636], in\r\nthe opinion of some, the longest headland of Italy, and then the Gulf\r\nof Scylacium[1637], and Scylacium[1638] itself, which was called by\r\nthe Athenians, when they founded it, Scylletium. This part of Italy\r\nis nearly a peninsula, in consequence of the Gulf of Terinæum[1639]\r\nrunning up into it on the other side; in it there is a harbour called\r\nCastra Hannibalis[1640]: in no part is Italy narrower than here, it\r\nbeing but twenty miles across. For this reason the Elder Dionysius\r\nentertained the idea of severing[1641] this portion from the main-land\r\nof Italy at this spot, and adding it to Sicily. The navigable rivers in\r\nthis district are the Carcines[1642], the Crotalus, the Semirus, the\r\nArocas, and the Targines. In the interior is the town of Petilia[1643],\r\nand there are besides, Mount Clibanus[1644], the promontory of\r\nLacinium, in front of which lies the island of Dioscoron[1645], ten\r\nmiles from the main-land, and another called the Isle of Calypso, which\r\nHomer is supposed to refer to under the name of Ogygia; as also the\r\nislands of Tiris, Eranusa, and Meloessa. According to Agrippa, the\r\npromontory of Lacinium[1646] is seventy miles from Caulon.\r\n\r\n(11.) At the promontory of Lacinium begins the second Gulf of Europe,\r\nthe bend of which forms an arc of great depth, and terminates at\r\nAcroceraunium, a promontory of Epirus, from which it is distant[1647]\r\nseventy-five miles. We first come to the town of Croton[1648], and then\r\nthe river Neæthus[1649], and the town of Thurii[1650], situate between\r\nthe two rivers Crathis and Sybaris, upon the latter of which there was\r\nonce a city[1651] of the same name. In a similar manner Heraclia[1652],\r\nsometimes called Siris, lies between the river of that name and the\r\nAciris. We next come to the rivers Acalandrus and Casuentum[1653], and\r\nthe town of Metapontum[1654], with which the third region of Italy\r\nterminates. In the interior of Bruttium, the Aprustani[1655] are the\r\nonly people; but in Lucania we find the Atinates, the Bantini, the\r\nEburini[1656], the Grumentini, the Potentini, the Sontini[1657], the\r\nSirini, the Tergilani, the Ursentini, and the Volcentani[1658], whom\r\nthe Numestrani join. Besides these, we learn from Cato[1659] that\r\nThebes in Lucania has disappeared, and Theopompus informs us that there\r\nwas formerly a city of the Lucani called Pandosia[1660], at which\r\nAlexander, the king of Epirus, died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16.—THE SECOND REGION OF ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdjoining to this district is the second region of Italy, which\r\nembraces the Hirpini, Calabria, Apulia, and the Salentini, extending a\r\ndistance of 250 miles along the Gulf of Tarentum, which receives its\r\nname from a town of the Laconians so called, situate at the bottom of\r\nthe Gulf, to which was annexed the maritime colony which had previously\r\nsettled there. Tarentum[1661] is distant from the promontory of\r\nLacinium 136 miles, and throws out the territory of Calabria opposite\r\nto it in the form of a peninsula. The Greeks called this territory\r\nMessapia, from their leader[1662]; before which it was called Peucetia,\r\nfrom Peucetius[1663], the brother of Œnotrius, and was comprised\r\nin the territory of Salentinum. Between the two promontories[1664]\r\nthere is a distance of 100 miles. The breadth across the peninsula\r\nfrom Tarentum[1665] to Brundusium by land is 35 miles, considerably\r\nless if measured from the port of Sasina[1666]. The towns inland from\r\nTarentum are Varia[1667] surnamed Apulia, Messapia, and Aletium[1668];\r\non the coast, Senum, and Callipolis[1669], now known as Anxa, 75 miles\r\nfrom Tarentum. Thence, at a distance of 32 miles, is the Promontory\r\nof Acra Iapygia[1670], at which point Italy projects the greatest\r\ndistance into the sea. At a distance of 19 miles from this point is the\r\ntown of Basta[1671], and then Hydruntum[1672], the spot at which the\r\nIonian is separated from the Adriatic sea, and from which the distance\r\nacross to Greece is the shortest. The town of the Apolloniates[1673]\r\nlies opposite to it, and the breadth of the arm of the sea which\r\nruns between is not more than fifty miles. Pyrrhus, king of Epirus,\r\nwas the first who entertained the notion of uniting these two points\r\nand making a passage on foot, by throwing a bridge across, and after\r\nhim M. Varro[1674], when commanding the fleet of Pompey in the war\r\nagainst the Pirates. Other cares however prevented either of them from\r\naccomplishing this design. Passing Hydruntum, we come to the deserted\r\nsite of Soletum[1675], then Fratuertium, the Portus Tarentinus, the\r\nhaven of Miltopa, Lupia[1676], Balesium[1677], Cælia[1678], and then\r\nBrundusium[1679], fifty miles from Hydruntum. This last place is one\r\nof the most famous ports of Italy, and, although more distant, affords\r\nby far the safest passage across to Greece, the place of disembarkation\r\nbeing Dyrrachium, a city of Illyria; the distance across is 225 miles.\r\n\r\nAdjoining Brundusium is the territory of the Pediculi[1680]; nine\r\nyouths and as many maidens, natives of Illyria, became the parents\r\nof sixteen nations. The towns of the Pediculi are Rudiæ[1681],\r\nEgnatia[1682], and Barium[1683]; their rivers are the Iapyx (so called\r\nfrom the son of Dædalus, who was king there, and who gave it the name\r\nof Iapygia), the Pactius[1684], and the Aufidus, which rises in the\r\nHirpinian mountains and flows past Canusium[1685].\r\n\r\nAt this point begins Apulia, surnamed the Daunian, from the Daunii,\r\nwho take their name from a former chief, the father-in-law of\r\nDiomedes. In this territory are the towns of Salapia[1686], famous\r\nfor Hannibal’s amour with a courtezan, Sipontum[1687], Uria, the\r\nriver Cerbalus[1688], forming the boundary of the Daunii, the port\r\nof Agasus[1689], and the Promontory of Mount Garganus[1690], distant\r\nfrom the Promontory of Salentinum or Iapygia 234 miles. Making the\r\ncircuit of Garganus, we come to the port of Garna[1691], the Lake\r\nPantanus[1692], the river Frento, the mouth of which forms a harbour,\r\nTeanum of the Apuli[1693], and Larinum, Cliternia[1694], and the river\r\nTifernus, at which the district of the Frentani[1695] begins. Thus\r\nthere were three different nations of the Apulians, [the Daunii,] the\r\nTeani, so called from their leader, and who sprang from the Greeks, and\r\nthe Lucani, who were subdued by Calchas[1696], and whose country is now\r\npossessed by the Atinates. Besides those already mentioned, there are,\r\nof the Daunii, the colonies of Luceria[1697] and Venusia[1698], the\r\ntowns of Canusium[1699] and Arpi, formerly called Argos Hippium[1700]\r\nand founded by Diomedes, afterwards called Argyrippa. Here too Diomedes\r\ndestroyed the nations of the Monadi and the Dardi, and the two cities\r\nof Apina and Trica[1701], whose names have passed into a by-word and a\r\nproverb.\r\n\r\nBesides the above, there is in the interior of the second region one\r\ncolony of the Hirpini, Beneventum[1702], so called by an exchange\r\nof a more auspicious name for its old one of Maleventum; also\r\nthe Æculani[1703], the Aquilonii[1704], the Abellinates surnamed\r\nProtropi, the Compsani, the Caudini, the Ligures, both those called\r\nthe Corneliani and Bebiani, the Vescellani, the Æclani, the Aletrini,\r\nthe Abellinates[1705] surnamed Marsi, the Atrani, the Æcani[1706],\r\nthe Alfellani[1707], the Atinates[1708], the Arpani, the Borcani,\r\nthe Collatini, the Corinenses, the Cannenses[1709], rendered famous\r\nby the defeat of the Romans, the Dirini, the Forentani[1710], the\r\nGenusini[1711], the Herdonienses, the Hyrini[1712], the Larinates\r\nsurnamed Frentani[1713], the Merinates[1714] of Garganus, the\r\nMateolani, the Netini[1715], the Rubustini[1716], the Silvini[1717],\r\nthe Strapellini[1718], the Turmentini, the Vibinates[1719], the\r\nVenusini, and the Ulurtini. In the interior of Calabria there are the\r\nÆgetini, the Apamestini[1720], the Argentini, the Butuntinenses[1721],\r\nthe Deciani, the Grumbestini, the Norbanenses, the Palionenses, the\r\nSturnini[1722], and the Tutini: there are also the following Salentine\r\nnations; the Aletini[1723], the Basterbini[1724], the Neretini, the\r\nUxentini, and the Veretini[1725].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17. (12.)—THE FOURTH REGION OF ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the fourth region, which includes the most valiant\r\nprobably of all the nations of Italy. Upon the coast, in the territory\r\nof the Frentani[1726], after the river Tifernus, we find the river\r\nTrinium[1727], with a good harbour at its mouth, the towns of\r\nHistonium[1728], Buca[1729], and Ortona, and the river Aternus[1730].\r\nIn the interior are the Anxani surnamed Frentani, the Higher and Lower\r\nCarentini[1731], and the Lanuenses; in the territory of the Marrucini,\r\nthe Teatini[1732]; in that of the Peligni, the Corfinienses[1733],\r\nthe Superæquani[1734], and the Sulmonenses[1735]; in that of the\r\nMarsi, the Anxantini[1736], the Atinates[1737], the Fucentes[1738],\r\nthe Lucenses[1739], and the Marruvini[1740]; in that of the Albenses,\r\nthe town of Alba on Lake Fucinus; in that of the Æquiculani, the\r\nCliternini[1741], and the Carseolani[1742]; in that of the Vestini,\r\nthe Angulani[1743], the Pinnenses, and the Peltuinates, adjoining to\r\nwhom are the Aufinates[1744] Cismontani; in that of the Samnites,\r\nwho have been called Sabelli[1745], and whom the Greeks have called\r\nSaunitæ, the colony of old Bovianum[1746], and that of the Undecumani,\r\nthe Aufidenates[1747], the Esernini[1748], the Fagifulani, the\r\nFicolenses[1749], the Sæpinates[1750], and the Tereventinates; in\r\nthat of the Sabini, the Amiternini[1751], the Curenses[1752], Forum\r\nDecî[1753], Forum Novum, the Fidenates, the Interamnates[1754], the\r\nNursini[1755], the Nomentani[1756], the Reatini[1757], the Trebulani,\r\nboth those called Mutusci[1758] and those called Suffenates[1759], the\r\nTiburtes, and the Tarinates.\r\n\r\nIn these districts, the Comini[1760], the Tadiates, the Cædici, and\r\nthe Alfaterni, tribes of the Æquiculi, have disappeared. From Gellianus\r\nwe learn that Archippe[1761], a town of the Marsi, built by Marsyas, a\r\nchieftain of the Lydians, has been swallowed up by Lake Fucinus, and\r\nValerianus informs us that the town of the Viticini in Picenum was\r\ndestroyed by the Romans. The Sabini (called, according to some writers,\r\nfrom their attention to religious[1762] observances and the worship\r\nof the gods, Sevini) dwell on the dew-clad hills in the vicinity of\r\nthe Lakes of the Velinus[1763]. The Nar, with its sulphureous waters,\r\nexhausts these lakes, and, descending from Mount Fiscellus[1764],\r\nunites with them near the groves of Vacuna[1765] and Reate, and\r\nthen directs its course towards the Tiber, into which it discharges\r\nitself. Again, in another direction, the Anio[1766], taking its rise\r\nin the mountain of the Trebani, carries into the Tiber the waters of\r\nthree lakes remarkable for their picturesque beauty, and to which\r\nSublaqueum[1767] is indebted for its name. In the territory of Reate\r\nis the Lake of Cutiliæ[1768], in which there is a floating island, and\r\nwhich, according to M. Varro, is the navel or central point of Italy.\r\nBelow the Sabine territory lies that of Latium, on one side Picenum,\r\nand behind it Umbria, while the range of the Apennines flanks it on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18. (13.)—THE FIFTH REGION OF ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fifth region is that of Picenum, once remarkable for the denseness\r\nof its population; 360,000 Picentines took the oaths of fidelity to\r\nthe Roman people. They are descended from the Sabines, who had made\r\na vow to celebrate a holy spring[1769]. Their territory commenced at\r\nthe river Aternus[1770], where the present district and colony of\r\nAdria[1771] is, at a distance of six miles from the sea. Here we find\r\nthe river Vomanus, the territories of Prætutia and Palma[1772], Castrum\r\nNovum[1773], the river Batinus; Truentum[1774], with its river of\r\nthe same name, which place is the only remnant of the Liburni[1775]\r\nin Italy; the river Albula[1776]; Tervium, at which the Prætutian\r\ndistrict ends, and that of Picenum begins; the town of Cupra[1777],\r\nCastellum Firmanorum[1778], and above it the colony of Asculum[1779],\r\nthe most illustrious in Picenum; in the interior there is the town of\r\nNovana[1780]. Upon the coast we have Cluana[1781], Potentia, Numana,\r\nfounded by the Siculi, and Ancona[1782], a colony founded by the same\r\npeople on the Promontory of Cumerus, forming an elbow of the coast,\r\nwhere it begins to bend inwards, and distant from Garganus 183 miles.\r\nIn the interior are the Auximates[1783], the Beregrani[1784], the\r\nCingulani, the Cuprenses surnamed Montani[1785], the Falarienses[1786],\r\nthe Pausulani, the Planinenses, the Ricinenses, the Septempedani[1787],\r\nthe Tollentinates, the Treienses, and the Pollentini of Urbs\r\nSalvia[1788].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19. (14.)—THE SIXTH REGION OF ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdjoining to this is the sixth region, which includes Umbria and the\r\nGallic territory in the vicinity of Ariminum. At Ancona begins the\r\ncoast of that part of Gaul known as Gallia Togata[1789]. The Siculi\r\nand the Liburni possessed the greater part of this district, and more\r\nparticularly the territories of Palma, of Prætutia, and of Adria. These\r\nwere expelled by the Umbri, these again by the Etrurians, and these in\r\ntheir turn by the Gauls. The Umbri are thought to have been the most\r\nancient race in Italy, it being supposed that they were called “Ombrii”\r\nby the Greeks, from the fact of their having survived the rains[1790]\r\nwhich had inundated the earth. We read that 300 of their towns were\r\nconquered by the Tusci; at the present day we find on their coast the\r\nriver Æsis[1791], Senogallia[1792], the river Metaurus, the colonies of\r\nFanum Fortunæ[1793] and Pisaurum[1794], with a river of the same name;\r\nand, in the interior, those of Hispellum[1795] and Tuder.\r\n\r\nBesides the above, there are the Amerini[1796], the Attidiates[1797],\r\nthe Asisinates[1798], the Arnates[1799], the Æsinates[1800], the\r\nCamertes[1801], the Casuentillani, the Carsulani[1802], the Dolates\r\nsurnamed Salentini, the Fulginiates[1803], the Foroflaminienses[1804],\r\nthe Forojulienses surnamed Concupienses, the Forobrentani, the\r\nForosempronienses[1805], the Iguvini[1806], the Interamnates surnamed\r\nNartes, the Mevanates[1807], the Mevanionenses, the Matilicates[1808],\r\nthe Narnienses[1809], whose town used formerly to be called Nequinum;\r\nthe Nucerini[1810], both those surnamed Favonienses and those called\r\nCamellani; the Ocriculani[1811], the Ostrani[1812], the Pitulani,\r\nboth those surnamed Pisuertes and the others called Mergentini;\r\nthe Plestini[1813], the Sentinates[1814], the Sarsinates[1815],\r\nthe Spoletini[1816], the Suasini[1817], the Sestinates[1818], the\r\nSuillates[1819], the Tadinates[1820], the Trebiates[1821], the\r\nTuficani[1822], the Tifernates[1823] surnamed Tiberini, and the\r\nothers called Metaurenses, the Vesinicates, the Urbinates, both those\r\nsurnamed Metaurenses[1824] and the others called Hortenses, the\r\nVettonenses[1825], the Vindinates, and the Viventani. In this district\r\nthere exist no longer the Feliginates who possessed Clusiolum above\r\nInteramna, and the Sarranates, with their towns of Acerræ[1826],\r\nsurnamed Vafriæ, and Turocelum, also called Vettiolum; as also the\r\nSolinates, the Curiates, the Fallienates, and the Apiennates. The\r\nArienates also have disappeared with the town of Crinovolum, as well as\r\nthe Usidicani, the Plangenses, the Pæsinates, and the Cælestini. Cato\r\nwrites that Ameria above-mentioned was founded 964 years before the war\r\nwith Perseus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20. (15.)—THE EIGHTH REGION OF ITALY; THE PADUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eighth region is bounded by Ariminum, the Padus, and the Apennines.\r\nUpon the coast we have the river Crustumium[1827], and the colony\r\nof Ariminum[1828], with the rivers Ariminus and Aprusa. Next comes\r\nthe river Rubico[1829], once the boundary of Italy, and after it the\r\nSapis[1830], the Vitis, and the Anemo, and then, Ravenna, a town of\r\nthe Sabines[1831], with the river Bedesis, 105 miles from Ancona;\r\nand, not far from the sea, Butrium[1832], a town of the Umbri. In\r\nthe interior there are the colonies of Bononia[1833], formerly\r\ncalled Felsina, when it was the chief place of Etruria[1834],\r\nBrixillum[1835], Mutina[1836], Parma[1837], and Placentia[1838]. There\r\nare also the towns of Cæsena[1839], Claterna, Forum Clodî[1840],\r\nForum Livî, Forum Popilî, Forum Truentinorum[1841], Forum Cornelî,\r\nForum Licinî, the Faventini[1842], the Fidentini[1843], the Otesini,\r\nthe Padinates[1844], the Regienses[1845], who take their name from\r\nLepidus, the Solonates[1846], the Saltus Galliani[1847], surnamed\r\nAquinates, the Tannetani[1848], the Veliates[1849], who were anciently\r\nsurnamed Regiates, and the Urbanates[1850]. In this district the\r\nBoii[1851] have disappeared, of whom there were 112 tribes according to\r\nCato; as also the Senones, who captured Rome.\r\n\r\n(16.) The Padus[1852] descends from the bosom of Mount Vesulus, one of\r\nthe most elevated points of the chain of the Alps, in the territories\r\nof the Ligurian Vagienni[1853], and rises at its source in a manner\r\nthat well merits an inspection by the curious; after which it hides\r\nitself in a subterranean channel until it rises again in the country of\r\nthe Forovibienses. It is inferior in fame to none whatever among the\r\nrivers, being known to the Greeks as the Eridanus and famous as the\r\nscene of the punishment of Phaëton[1854]. At the rising of the Dog-star\r\nit is swollen by the melted snows; but, though it proves more furious\r\nin its course to the adjoining fields than to the vessels that are\r\nupon it, still it takes care to carry away no portion of its banks,\r\nand when it recedes, renders them additionally fertile. Its length\r\nfrom its source is 300 miles, to which we must add eighty-eight for\r\nits sinuosities; and it receives from the Apennines and Alps not only\r\nseveral navigable rivers, but immense lakes as well, which discharge\r\nthemselves into its waters, thus conveying altogether as many as thirty\r\nstreams into the Adriatic Sea.\r\n\r\nOf these the best known are the following—flowing from the range of\r\nthe Apennines, the Jactus, the Tanarus[1855], the Trebia which passes\r\nPlacentia, the Tarus, the Incia, the Gabellus, the Scultenna, and the\r\nRhenus: from the chain of the Alps, the Stura[1856], the Orgus, the two\r\nDuriæ, the Sessites, the Ticinus, the Lambrus, the Addua, the Ollius,\r\nand the Mincius. There is no river known to receive a larger increase\r\nthan this in so short a space; so much so indeed that it is impelled\r\nonwards by this vast body of water, and, invading the land[1857], forms\r\ndeep channels in its course: hence it is that, although a portion\r\nof its stream is drawn off by rivers and canals between Ravenna\r\nand Altinum, for a space of 120 miles, still, at the spot where it\r\ndischarges the vast body of its waters, it is said to form seven seas.\r\n\r\nBy the Augustan Canal the Padus is carried to Ravenna, at which place\r\nit is called the Padusa[1858], having formerly borne the name of\r\nMessanicus. The nearest mouth to this spot forms the extensive port\r\nknown as that of Vatrenus, where Claudius Cæsar[1859], on his triumph\r\nover the Britons, entered the Adriatic in a vessel that deserved rather\r\nthe name of a vast palace than a ship. This mouth, which was formerly\r\ncalled by some the Eridanian, has been by others styled the Spinetic\r\nmouth, from the city of Spina, a very powerful place which formerly\r\nstood in the vicinity, if we may form a conclusion from the amount of\r\nits treasure deposited at Delphi; it was founded by Diomedes. At this\r\nspot the river Vatrenus[1860], which flows from the territory of Forum\r\nCornelî, swells the waters of the Padus.\r\n\r\nThe next mouth to this is that of Caprasia[1861], then that of Sagis,\r\nand then Volane, formerly called Olane; all of which are situate upon\r\nthe Flavian Canal[1862], which the Tuscans formerly made from Sagis,\r\nthus drawing the impetuous stream of the river across into the marshes\r\nof the Atriani, which they call the Seven Seas; and upon which is the\r\nnoble port of Atria[1863], a city of the Tuscans, from which place the\r\nsea was formerly called the Atriatic, though now the Adriatic.\r\n\r\nWe next come to the overflowing mouths of Carbonaria, and the Fosses\r\nof Philistina[1864], by some called Tartarus[1865], all of which\r\noriginate in the overflow of the waters in the Philistinian Canal,\r\nswollen by the streams of the Atesis, descending from the Tridentine\r\nAlps, and of the Togisonus[1866], flowing from the territory of\r\nthe Patavini. A portion of them also forms the adjoining port of\r\nBrundulum[1867], in the same manner as Edron[1868] is formed by the\r\ntwo rivers Meduacus and the Clodian Canal. With the waters of these\r\nstreams the Padus unites, and with them discharges itself into the\r\nsea, forming, according to most writers, between the Alps and the\r\nsea-shore a triangular figure, 2000 stadia in circumference, not unlike\r\nthe Delta formed by the Nile in Egypt. I feel somewhat ashamed to\r\nhave to borrow from the Greeks any statement in reference to Italy;\r\nMetrodorus of Scepsos, however, informs us that this river has obtained\r\nits name of Padus from the fact, that about its source there are\r\ngreat numbers of pine-trees, which in the Gallic language are called\r\n“padi.” In the tongue of the Ligurians this river is called “Bodincus,”\r\nwhich signifies “the bottomless.” This derivation is in some measure\r\nsupported by the fact that near this river there is the town of\r\nIndustria[1869], of which the ancient name was Bodincomagum, and where\r\nthe river begins to be of greater depth than in other parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21. (17.)—THE ELEVENTH REGION OF ITALY; ITALIA TRANSPADANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the river Padus the eleventh region receives its name of\r\nTranspadana; to which, situate as it is wholly in the interior, the\r\nriver, by its bounteous channel, conveys the gifts of all the seas.\r\nThe towns are Vibî Forum[1870] and Segusio; and, at the foot of the\r\nAlps, the colony of Augusta Taurinorum[1871], at which place the Padus\r\nbecomes navigable, and which was founded by the ancient race of the\r\nLigurians, and of Augusta Prætoria[1872] of the Salassi, near the two\r\npasses of the Alps, the Grecian[1873] and the Penine (by the latter\r\nit is said that the Carthaginians passed into Italy, by the Grecian,\r\nHercules)—the town of Eporedia[1874], the foundation of which by the\r\nRoman people was enjoined by the Sibylline books; the Gauls call\r\ntamers of horses by the name of “Eporediæ”—Vercellæ[1875], the town of\r\nthe Libici, derived its origin from the Salluvii, and Novaria[1876],\r\nfounded by the Vertacomacori, is at the present day a district of the\r\nVocontii, and not, as Cato supposes, of the Ligurians; of whom two\r\nnations, called the Lævi and the Marici, founded Ticinum[1877], not far\r\nfrom the Padus, as the Boii, descended from the Transalpine nations,\r\nhave founded Laus Pompeia[1878] and the Insubres Mediolanum[1879].\r\n\r\nFrom Cato we also learn that Comum, Bergomum[1880], and\r\nLicinîforum[1881], and some other peoples in the vicinity, originated\r\nwith the Orobii, but he admits that he is ignorant as to the origin\r\nof that nation. Cornelius Alexander however informs us that they came\r\nfrom Greece, interpreting their name as meaning “those who live upon\r\nthe mountains[1882].” In this district, Parra has disappeared, a town\r\nof the Orobii, from whom, according to Cato, the people of Bergomum are\r\ndescended; its site even yet shows that it was situate in a position\r\nmore elevated than fruitful[1883]. The Caturiges have also perished, an\r\nexiled race of the Insubres, as also Spina previously mentioned; Melpum\r\ntoo, a place distinguished for its opulence, which, as we are informed\r\nby Cornelius Nepos, was destroyed by the Insubres, the Boii, and the\r\nSenones, on the very day on which Camillus took Veii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (18.)—THE TENTH REGION OF ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the tenth region of Italy, situate on the Adriatic Sea.\r\nIn this district are Venetia[1884], the river Silis[1885], rising\r\nin the Tarvisanian[1886] mountains, the town of Altinum[1887], the\r\nriver Liquentia rising in the mountains of Opitergium[1888], and a\r\nport with the same name, the colony of Concordia[1889]; the rivers and\r\nharbours of Romatinum[1890], the greater and less Tiliaventum[1891],\r\nthe Anaxum[1892], into which the Varamus flows, the Alsa[1893], and the\r\nNatiso with the Turrus, which flow past the colony of Aquileia[1894]\r\nat a distance of fifteen miles from the sea. This is the country of\r\nthe Carni[1895], and adjoining to it is that of the Iapydes, the\r\nriver Timavus[1896], the fortress of Pucinum[1897], famous for its\r\nwines, the Gulf of Tergeste[1898], and the colony of that name,\r\nthirty-three miles from Aquileia. Six miles beyond this place lies\r\nthe river Formio[1899], 189 miles distant from Ravenna, the ancient\r\nboundary[1900] of enlarged Italy, and now the frontier of Istria. That\r\nthis region takes its name from the river Ister which flows from the\r\nDanube, also called the Ister, into the Adriatic opposite the mouth of\r\nthe Padus, and that the sea which lies between them is rendered fresh\r\nby their waters running from opposite directions, has been erroneously\r\nasserted by many, and among them by Nepos even, who dwelt upon the\r\nbanks of the Padus. For it is the fact that no river which runs from\r\nthe Danube discharges itself into the Adriatic. They have been misled,\r\nI think, by the circumstance that the ship Argo came down some river\r\ninto the Adriatic sea, not far from Tergeste; but what river that was\r\nis now unknown. The most careful writers say that the ship was carried\r\nacross the Alps on men’s shoulders, having passed along the Ister,\r\nthen along the Savus, and so from Nauportus[1901], which place, lying\r\nbetween Æmona[1902] and the Alps, from that circumstance derives its\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23. (19.)—ISTRIA, ITS PEOPLE AND LOCALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIstria projects in the form of a peninsula. Some writers have stated\r\nits length to be forty miles, and its circumference 125; and the same\r\nas to Liburnia which adjoins it, and the Flanatic Gulf[1903], while\r\nothers make it 225[1904]; others again make the circumference of\r\nLiburnia 180 miles. Some persons too extend Iapydia, at the back of\r\nIstria, as far as the Flanatic Gulf, a distance of 130 miles, thus\r\nmaking Liburnia but 150 miles. Tuditanus[1905], who subdued the Istri,\r\nhad this inscription on his statue which was erected there: “From\r\nAquileia to the river Titus is a distance of 1000 stadia.”\r\n\r\nThe towns of Istria with the rights of Roman citizens are Ægida[1906],\r\nParentium, and the colony of Pola[1907], now Pietas Julia, formerly\r\nfounded by the Colchians, and distant from Tergeste 100 miles:\r\nafter which we come to the town of Nesactium[1908], and the river\r\nArsia, now[1909] the boundary of Italy. The distance across from\r\nAncona to Pola is 120 miles. In the interior of the tenth region\r\nare the colonies of Cremona, Brixia in the territory of the\r\nCenomanni[1910], Ateste[1911] belonging to the Veneti, and the towns\r\nof Acelum[1912], Patavium[1913], Opitergium, Belunum[1914], and\r\nVicetia; with Mantua[1915], the only city of the Tuscans now left\r\nbeyond the Padus. Cato informs us that the Veneti are descendants\r\nof the Trojans[1916], and that the Cenomanni[1917] dwelt among\r\nthe Volcæ in the vicinity of Massilia. There are also the towns\r\nof the Fertini[1918], the Tridentini[1919], and the Beruenses,\r\nbelonging to the Rhæti, Verona[1920], belonging to the Rhæti and\r\nthe Euganei, and Julienses[1921] to the Carni. We then have the\r\nfollowing peoples, whom there is no necessity to particularize\r\nwith any degree of exactness, the Alutrenses, the Asseriates, the\r\nFlamonienses[1922] with those surnamed Vanienses, and the others called\r\nCulici, the Forojulienses[1923] surnamed Transpadani, the Foretani,\r\nthe Nedinates[1924], the Quarqueni[1925], the Taurisani[1926],\r\nthe Togienses, and the Varvari. In this district there have\r\ndisappeared—upon the coast—Iramene, Pellaon, and Palsatium, Atina and\r\nCælina belonging to the Veneti, Segeste and Ocra to the Carni, and\r\nNoreia to the Taurisci. L. Piso also informs us that although the\r\nsenate disapproved of his so doing, M. Claudius Marcellus[1927] razed\r\nto the ground a tower situate at the twelfth mile-stone from Aquileia.\r\n\r\nIn this region also and the eleventh there are some celebrated\r\nlakes[1928], and several rivers that either take their rise in them or\r\nelse are fed by their waters, in those cases in which they again emerge\r\nfrom them. These are the Addua[1929], fed by the Lake Larius, the\r\nTicinus by Lake Verbannus, the Mincius by Lake Benacus, the Ollius by\r\nLake Sebinnus, and the Lambrus by Lake Eupilis—all of them flowing into\r\nthe Padus.\r\n\r\nCælius states that the length of the Alps from the Upper Sea to the\r\nLower is 1000 miles, a distance which Timagenes shortens by twenty-two.\r\nCornelius Nepos assigns to them a breadth of 100 miles, and T. Livius\r\nof 3000 stadia; but then in different places. For in some localities\r\nthey exceed 100 miles; where they divide Germany, for instance, from\r\nItaly; while in other parts they do not reach seventy, being thus\r\nnarrowed by the providential dispensation of nature as it were. The\r\nbreadth of Italy, taken from the river Var at the foot of these\r\nmountains, and passing along by the Vada[1930] Sabatia, the Taurini,\r\nComum, Brixia, Verona, Vicetia, Opitergium, Aquileia, Tergeste, Pola,\r\nand Arsia, is 745 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24. (20.)—THE ALPS, AND THE ALPINE NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany nations dwell among the Alps; but the more remarkable, between\r\nPola and the district of Tergeste, are the Secusses, the Subocrini, the\r\nCatali, the Menocaleni, and near the Carni the people formerly called\r\nthe Taurisci, but now the Norici. Adjoining to these are the Rhæti and\r\nthe Vindelici, who are all divided into a multitude of states. It is\r\nsupposed that the Rhæti are the descendants of the Tuscans, who were\r\nexpelled by the Gauls and migrated hither under the command of their\r\nchief, whose name was Rhætus. Turning then to the side of the Alps\r\nwhich fronts Italy, we have the Euganean[1931] nations enjoying Latin\r\nrights, and of whom Cato enumerates thirty-four towns. Among these are\r\nthe Triumpilini, a people who were sold[1932] with their territory;\r\nand then the Camuni, and several similar tribes, each of them in the\r\njurisdiction of its neighbouring municipal town. The same author also\r\nconsiders the Lepontii[1933] and the Salassi to be of Tauriscan\r\norigin, but most other writers, giving a Greek[1934] interpretation to\r\ntheir name, consider the Lepontii to have been those of the followers\r\nof Hercules who were left behind in consequence of their limbs being\r\nfrozen by the snow of the Alps. They are also of opinion that the\r\ninhabitants of the Grecian Alps are descended from a portion of the\r\nGreeks of his army, and that the Euganeans, being sprung from an origin\r\nso illustrious, thence took their name[1935]. The head of these are the\r\nStœni[1936]. The Vennonenses[1937] and the Sarunetes[1938], peoples\r\nof the Rhæti, dwell about the sources of the river Rhenus, while the\r\ntribe of the Lepontii, known as the Uberi, dwell in the vicinity of the\r\nsources of the Rhodanus, in the same district of the Alps. There are\r\nalso other native tribes here, who have received Latin rights, such\r\nas the Octodurenses[1939], and their neighbours the Centrones[1940],\r\nthe Cottian[1941] states, the Ligurian Vagienni, descended from the\r\nCaturiges[1942], as also those called Montani[1943]; besides numerous\r\nnations of the Capillati[1944], on the confines of the Ligurian Sea.\r\n\r\nIt may not be inappropriate in this place to subjoin the inscription\r\nnow to be seen upon the trophy[1945] erected on the Alps, which is\r\nto the following effect:—“TO THE EMPEROR CÆSAR—THE SON[1946] OF\r\nCÆSAR NOW DEIFIED, AUGUSTUS, PONTIFEX MAXIMUS, AND EMPEROR FOURTEEN\r\nYEARS, IN THE SEVENTEENTH[1947] YEAR OF HIS HOLDING THE TRIBUNITIAL\r\nAUTHORITY, THE SENATE AND THE ROMAN PEOPLE, IN REMEMBRANCE THAT UNDER\r\nHIS COMMAND AND AUSPICES ALL THE ALPINE NATIONS WHICH EXTENDED FROM\r\nTHE UPPER SEA TO THE LOWER WERE REDUCED TO SUBJECTION BY THE ROMAN\r\nPEOPLE—THE ALPINE NATIONS SO SUBDUED WERE: THE TRIUMPILINI, THE\r\nCAMUNI, THE VENOSTES[1948], THE VENNONENSES, THE ISARCI, THE BREUNI,\r\nTHE GENAUNES[1949], THE FOCUNATES, FOUR NATIONS OF THE VINDELICI,\r\nTHE CONSUANETES, THE RUCINATES, THE LICATES[1950], THE CATENATES,\r\nTHE AMBISONTES, THE RUGUSCI, THE SUANETES[1951], THE CALUCONES, THE\r\nBRIXENTES, THE LEPONTII, THE UBERI, THE NANTUATES, THE SEDUNI, THE\r\nVARAGRI, THE SALASSI, THE ACITAVONES, THE MEDULLI, THE UCENI[1952],\r\nTHE CATURIGES, THE BRIGIANI, THE SOGIONTII, THE BRODIONTII, THE\r\nNEMALONI, THE EDENATES[1953], THE ESUBIANI, THE VEAMINI, THE GALLITÆ,\r\nTHE TRIULATTI, THE ECDINI, THE VERGUNNI, THE EGUITURI[1954], THE\r\nNEMENTURI, THE ORATELLI, THE NERUSI, THE VELAUNI, AND THE SUETRI.”\r\n\r\nThe twelve states of the Cottiani[1955] were not included in the list,\r\nas they had shown no hostility, nor yet those which had been placed by\r\nthe Pompeian law under the jurisdiction of the municipal towns.\r\n\r\nSuch then is Italy, sacred to the gods, such are the nations, such the\r\ncities of her peoples; to which we may add, that this is that same\r\nItaly, which, when L. Æmilius Paulus[1956] and C. Attilius Regulus\r\nwere Consuls, on hearing of the rising in Gaul, unaided, and without\r\nany foreign assistance whatever, without the help even of that portion\r\nwhich lies beyond the Padus, armed 80,000 horse and 700,000 foot. In\r\nabundance of metals of every kind Italy yields to no land whatever; but\r\nall search for them has been prohibited by an ancient decree of the\r\nSenate, who gave orders thereby that Italy shall be exempted[1957] from\r\nsuch treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25. (21.)—LIBURNIA AND ILLYRICUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nation of the Liburni adjoins the river Arsia[1958], and extends\r\nas far as the river Titus. The Mentores, the Hymani[1959], the\r\nEncheleæ, the Buni, and the people whom Callimachus calls the Peucetiæ,\r\nformerly formed part of it; but now the whole in general are comprised\r\nunder the one name of Illyricum. But few of the names of these nations\r\nare worthy of mention, or indeed very easy of pronunciation. To the\r\njurisdiction of Scardona[1960] resort the Iapydes and fourteen cities\r\nof the Liburni, of which it may not prove tedious if I mention the\r\nLacinienses, the Stlupini, the Burnistæ, and the Olbonenses. Belonging\r\nto the same jurisdiction there are, in the enjoyment of Italian rights,\r\nthe Alutæ[1961], the Flanates[1962], from whom the Gulf takes its name,\r\nthe Lopsi, and the Varvarini; the Assesiates, who are exempt from\r\ntribute; and upon the islands, the Fertinates and the Curictæ[1963].\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are on the coast, after leaving Nesactium,\r\nAlvona[1964], Flanona, Tarsatica, Senia, Lopsica, Ortopula, Vegium,\r\nArgyruntum, Corinium[1965], Ænona, the city of Pasinum, and the river\r\nTedanius, at which Iapydia terminates. The islands of this Gulf, with\r\ntheir towns, besides those above mentioned, are Absyrtium[1966],\r\nArba[1967], Crexa, Gissa, and Portunata. Again, on the mainland there\r\nis the colony of Iadera[1968], distant from Pola 160 miles; then,\r\nat a distance of thirty miles, the island of Colentum[1969], and of\r\neighteen, the mouth of the river Titus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26. (22.)—DALMATIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nScardona, situate upon the river[1970], at a distance of twelve\r\nmiles from the sea, forms the boundary of Liburnia and the beginning\r\nof Dalmatia. Next to this place comes the ancient country of\r\nthe Autariatares and the fortress of Tariona, the Promontory of\r\nDiomedes[1971], or, as others call it, the peninsula of Hyllis, 100\r\nmiles[1972] in circuit. Then comes Tragurium, a place with the rights\r\nof Roman citizens, and celebrated for its marble, Sicum, a place to\r\nwhich Claudius, the emperor lately deified, sent a colony of his\r\nveterans, and Salona[1973], a colony, situate 112 miles from Iadera.\r\nTo this place resort for legal purposes, having the laws dispensed\r\naccording to their divisions into decuries or tithings, the Dalmatæ,\r\nforming 342 decuries, the Deurici 22, the Ditiones 239, the Mazæi 269,\r\nand the Sardiates 52. In this region are Burnum[1974], Andetrium[1975],\r\nand Tribulium, fortresses ennobled by the battles of the Roman people.\r\nTo the same jurisdiction also belong the Issæi[1976], the Colentini,\r\nthe Separi, and the Epetini, nations inhabiting the islands. After\r\nthese come the fortresses of Peguntium[1977] and of Rataneum, with the\r\ncolony of Narona[1978], the seat of the third jurisdiction, distant\r\nfrom Salona eighty-two miles, and situate upon a river of the same\r\nname, at a distance of twenty miles from the sea. M. Varro states that\r\neighty-nine states used to resort thither, but now nearly the only ones\r\nthat are known are the Cerauni[1979] with 24 decuries, the Daorizi with\r\n17, the Dæsitiates with 103, the Docleatæ with 33, the Deretini with\r\n14, the Deremistæ with 30, the Dindari with 33, the Glinditiones with\r\n44, the Melcomani with 24, the Naresii with 102, the Scirtarii with\r\n72, the Siculotæ with 24, and the Vardæi, once the scourges of Italy,\r\nwith no more than 20 decuries. In addition to these, this district\r\nwas possessed by the Ozuæi, the Partheni, the Hemasini, the Arthitæ,\r\nand the Armistæ. The colony of Epidaurum[1980] is distant from the\r\nriver Naron 100 miles. After Epidaurum come the following towns, with\r\nthe rights of Roman citizens:—Rhizinium[1981], Acruvium[1982], Butua,\r\nOlcinium, formerly called Colchinium, having been founded by the\r\nColchians; the river Drilo[1983], and, upon it, Scodra[1984], a town\r\nwith the rights of Roman citizens, situate at a distance of eighteen\r\nmiles from the sea; besides in former times many Greek towns and once\r\npowerful states, of which all remembrance is fast fading away. For in\r\nthis region there were formerly the Labeatæ, the Enderini[1985], the\r\nSasæi, the Grabæi[1986], properly called Illyrii, the Taulantii[1987],\r\nand the Pyræi. The Promontory of Nymphæum on the sea-coast still\r\nretains its name[1988]; and there is Lissum, a town enjoying the rights\r\nof Roman citizens, at a distance from Epidaurum of 100 miles.\r\n\r\n(23.) At Lissum begins the province of Macedonia[1989], the nations\r\nof the Parthini[1990], and behind them the Dassaretæ[1991]. The\r\nmountains of Candavia[1992] are seventy-eight miles from Dyrrhachium.\r\nOn the coast lies Denda, a town with the rights of Roman citizens,\r\nthe colony of Epidamnum[1993], which, on account of its inauspicious\r\nname, was by the Romans called Dyrrhachium, the river Aöus[1994],\r\nby some called Æas, and Apollonia[1995], formerly a colony of the\r\nCorinthians, at a distance of four miles from the sea, in the\r\nvicinity of which the celebrated Nymphæum[1996] is inhabited by the\r\nbarbarous Amantes[1997] and Buliones. Upon the coast too is the town\r\nof Oricum[1998], founded by the Colchians. At this spot begins Epirus,\r\nwith the Acroceraunian[1999] mountains, by which we have previously\r\nmentioned[2000] this Gulf of Europe as bounded. Oricum is distant from\r\nthe Promontory of Salentinum in Italy eighty[2001] miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27. (24.)—THE NORICI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the rear of the Carni and the Iapydes, along the course of the great\r\nriver Ister[2002], the Rhæti touch upon the Norici[2003]: their towns\r\nare Virunum[2004], Celeia, Teurnia, Aguntum[2005], Vianiomina[2006],\r\nClaudia[2007], and Flavium Solvense[2008]. Adjoining to the Norici is\r\nLake Peiso[2009], and the deserts of the Boii[2010]; they are however\r\nnow inhabited by the people of Sabaria[2011], a colony of the now\r\ndeified emperor Claudius, and the town of Scarabantia Julia[2012].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28. (25.)—PANNONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to them comes acorn-bearing Pannonia[2013], along which the\r\nchain of the Alps, gradually lessening as it runs through the middle\r\nof Illyricum from north to south, forms a gentle slope on the right\r\nhand and the left. The portion which looks towards the Adriatic Sea\r\nis called Dalmatia and Illyricum, above mentioned, while Pannonia\r\nstretches away towards the north, and has the Danube for its extreme\r\nboundary. In it are the colonies of Æmona[2014] and Siscia. The\r\nfollowing rivers, both known to fame and adapted for commerce, flow\r\ninto the Danube; the Draus[2015], which rushes from Noricum with great\r\nimpetuosity, and the Savus[2016], which flows with a more gentle\r\ncurrent from the Carnic Alps, there being a space between them of 120\r\nmiles. The Draus runs through the Serretes, the Serrapilli[2017],\r\nthe Iasi, and the Andizetes; the Savus through the Colapiani[2018]\r\nand the Breuci; these are the principal peoples. Besides them there\r\nare the Arivates, the Azali, the Amantini, the Belgites, the Catari,\r\nthe Cornacates, the Eravisci, the Hercuniates[2019], the Latovici,\r\nthe Oseriates, the Varciani, and, in front of Mount Claudius, the\r\nScordisci, behind it the Taurisci. In the Savus there is the island of\r\nMetubarris[2020], the greatest of all the islands formed by rivers.\r\nBesides the above, there are these other rivers worthy of mention:—the\r\nColapis[2021], which flows into the Savus near Siscia, where, dividing\r\nits channel, it forms the island which is called Segestica[2022]; and\r\nthe river Bacuntius[2023], which flows into the Savus at the town of\r\nSirmium, where we find the state of the Sirmienses and the Amantini.\r\nForty-five miles thence is Taurunum[2024], where the Savus flows into\r\nthe Danube; above which spot the Valdanus[2025] and the Urpanus,\r\nthemselves far from ignoble rivers, join that stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29. (26.)—MŒSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoining up to Pannonia is the province called Mœsia[2026], which runs,\r\nwith the course of the Danube, as far as the Euxine. It commences at\r\nthe confluence[2027] previously mentioned. In it are the Dardani, the\r\nCelegeri, the Triballi, the Timachi, the Mœsi, the Thracians, and the\r\nScythians who border on the Euxine. The more famous among its rivers\r\nare the Margis[2028], which rises in the territory of the Dardani, the\r\nPingus, the Timachus, the Œscus which rises in Mount Rhodope, and,\r\nrising in Mount Hæmus, the Utus[2029], the Asamus, and the Ieterus.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of Illyricum[2030] at its widest part is 325 miles, and its\r\nlength from the river Arsia to the river Drinius 530; from the Drinius\r\nto the Promontory of Acroceraunia Agrippa states to be 175 miles, and\r\nhe says that the entire circuit of the Italian and Illyrian Gulf is\r\n1700 miles. In this Gulf, according to the limits which we have drawn,\r\nare two seas, the Ionian[2031] in the first part, and the Adriatic,\r\nwhich runs more inland and is called the Upper Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—ISLANDS OF THE IONIAN SEA AND THE ADRIATIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Ausonian Sea there are no islands worthy of notice beyond those\r\nwhich we have already mentioned, and only a few in the Ionian; those,\r\nfor instance, upon the Calabrian coast, opposite Brundusium, by the\r\nprojection of which a harbour is formed; and, over against the Apulian\r\ncoast, Diomedia[2032], remarkable for the monument of Diomedes, and\r\nanother island called by the same name, but by some Teutria.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Illyricum is clustered with more than 1000 islands,\r\nthe sea being of a shoaly nature, and numerous creeks and æstuaries\r\nrunning with their narrow channels between portions of the land. The\r\nmore famous are those before the mouths of the Timavus, with warm\r\nsprings[2033] that rise with the tides of the sea, the island of\r\nCissa near the territory of the Istri, and the Pullaria[2034] and\r\nAbsyrtides[2035], so called by the Greeks from the circumstance of\r\nAbsyrtus, the brother of Medea, having been slain there. Some islands\r\nnear them have been called the Electrides[2036], upon which amber,\r\nwhich they call “electrum,” was said to be found; a most assured\r\ninstance however of that untruthfulness[2037] which is generally\r\nascribed to the Greeks, seeing that it has never yet been ascertained\r\nwhich of the islands were meant by them under that name. Opposite to\r\nthe Iader is Lissa, and other islands whose names have been already\r\nmentioned[2038]. Opposite to the Liburni are some islands called the\r\nCrateæ, and no smaller number styled Liburnicæ and Celadussæ[2039].\r\nOpposite to Surium is Bavo, and Brattia[2040], famous for its goats,\r\nIssa with the rights of Roman citizens, and Pharia with a town. At a\r\ndistance of twenty-five miles from Issa is Corcyra[2041], surnamed\r\nMelæna, with a town founded by the Cnidians; between which and\r\nIllyricum is Melite[2042], from which, as we learn from Callimachus, a\r\ncertain kind of little dogs were called Melitæi; fifteen miles from it\r\nwe find the seven Elaphites[2043]. In the Ionian Sea, at a distance of\r\ntwelve miles from Oricum, is Sasonis[2044], notorious from having been\r\na harbour of pirates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—The towns and nations mentioned are in number * * * *[2045].\r\nThe rivers of note are in number * * * *.

(1.)—EPIRUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third great Gulf of Europe begins at the mountains of\r\nAcroceraunia[2083], and ends at the Hellespont, embracing an extent of\r\n2500 miles, exclusive of the sea-line of nineteen smaller gulfs. Upon\r\nit are Epirus, Acarnania, Ætolia, Phocis, Locris, Achaia, Messenia,\r\nLaconia, Argolis, Megaris, Attica, Bœotia; and again, upon the other\r\nsea[2084], the same Phocis and Locris, Doris, Phthiotis, Thessalia,\r\nMagnesia, Macedonia and Thracia. All the fabulous lore of Greece, as\r\nwell as the effulgence of her literature, first shone forth upon the\r\nbanks of this Gulf. We shall therefore dwell a little the longer upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nEpirus[2085], generally so called, begins at the mountains of\r\nAcroceraunia. The first people that we meet are the Chaones, from whom\r\nChaonia[2086] receives its name, then the Thesproti[2087], and then\r\nthe Antigonenses[2088]. We then come to the place where Aornos[2089]\r\nstood, with its exhalations so deadly to the feathered race, the\r\nCestrini[2090], the Perrhæbi[2091], in whose country Mount Pindus is\r\nsituate, the Cassiopæi[2092], the Dryopes[2093], the Sellæ[2094], the\r\nHellopes[2095], the Molossi, in whose territory is the temple of the\r\nDodonæan Jupiter, so famous for its oracle; and Mount Tomarus[2096], so\r\nhighly praised by Theopompus, with its hundred springs gushing from its\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n(2.) Epirus, properly so called, advances towards Magnesia and\r\nMacedonia, having at its back the Dassaretæ, previously[2097]\r\nmentioned, a free nation, and after them the Dardani, a savage race.\r\nOn the left hand, before the Dardani are extended the Triballi and the\r\nnations of Mœsia, while in front of them the Medi and the Denselatæ\r\njoin, and next to them the Thracians, who stretch away as far as the\r\nEuxine: in such a manner is a rampart raised around the lofty heights\r\nof Rhodope, and then of Hæmus.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Epirus is the fortress of Chimæra[2098], situate upon\r\nthe Acroceraunian range, and below it the spring known as the Royal\r\nWaters[2099]; then the towns of Mæandria, and Cestria[2100], the\r\nThyamis[2101], a river of Thesprotia, the colony of Buthrotum[2102],\r\nand the Ambracian Gulf[2103], so famed in history; which, with an inlet\r\nonly half a mile in width, receives a vast body of water from the sea,\r\nbeing thirty-seven miles in length, and fifteen in width. The river\r\nAcheron, which runs through Acherusia, a lake of Thesprotia, flows\r\ninto it[2104] after a course of thirty-six miles; it is considered\r\nwonderful for its bridge, 1000 feet in length, by a people who look\r\nupon everything as wonderful that belongs to themselves. Upon this Gulf\r\nis also situate the town of Ambracia. There are also the Aphas and the\r\nArachthus[2105], rivers of the Molossi; the city of Anactoria[2106],\r\nand the place where Pandosia[2107] stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2.—ACARNANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe towns of Acarnania[2108], the ancient name of which was Curetis,\r\nare Heraclia[2109], Echinus[2110], and, on the coast, Actium, a colony\r\nfounded by Augustus, with its famous temple of Apollo and the free\r\ncity of Nicopolis[2111]. Passing out of the Ambracian Gulf into the\r\nIonian Sea, we come to the coast of Leucadia, with the Promontory of\r\nLeucate[2112], and then the Gulf and the peninsula of Leucadia[2113],\r\nwhich last was formerly called Neritis[2114]. By the exertions of\r\nthe inhabitants it was once cut off from the mainland, but was again\r\njoined to it by the vast bodies of sand accumulated through the action\r\nof the winds. This spot is called Dioryctos[2115], and is three\r\nstadia in length: on the peninsula is the town of Leucas, formerly\r\ncalled Neritus[2116]. We next come to Alyzia[2117], Stratos[2118],\r\nand Argos[2119], surnamed Amphilochian, cities of the Acarnanians:\r\nthe river Acheloüs[2120] flows from the heights of Pindus, and,\r\nafter separating Acarnania from Ætolia, is fast adding the island of\r\nArtemita[2121] to the mainland by the continual deposits of earth which\r\nit brings down its stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3. (2.)—ÆTOLIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peoples of Ætolia are the Athamanes[2122], the Tymphæi[2123], the\r\nEphyri[2124], the Ænienses, the Perrhæbi[2125], the Dolopes[2126], the\r\nMaraces, and the Atraces[2127], in whose territory rises the river\r\nAtrax, which flows into the Ionian Sea. Calydon[2128] is a city of\r\nÆtolia, situate at a distance of seven miles from the sea, and near\r\nthe banks of the river Evenus[2129]. We then come to Macynia[2130],\r\nand Molycria, behind which lie Mounts Chalcis[2131] and Taphiassus.\r\nOn the coast again, there is the promontory of Antirrhium[2132],\r\noff which is the mouth of the Corinthian Gulf, which flows in and\r\nseparates Ætolia from the Peloponnesus, being less[2133] than one mile\r\nin width. The promontory which faces it on the opposite side is called\r\nRhion[2134]. The towns of Ætolia, however, on the Corinthian Gulf\r\nare Naupactus[2135] and Pylene[2136]; and, more inland, Pleuron and\r\nHalicyrna[2137]. The most famous mountains are Tomarus, in the district\r\nof Dodona, Crania[2138] in Ambracia, Aracynthus[2139] in Acarnania, and\r\nAcanthon[2140], Panætolium[2141], and Macynium[2142], in Ætolia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4. (3.)—LOCRIS AND PHOCIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to Ætolia are the Locri[2143], surnamed Ozolæ; a people exempt\r\nfrom tribute. Here is the town of Œanthe[2144], the port[2145] of\r\nApollo Phæstius, and the Gulf of Crissa[2146]. In the interior are the\r\ntowns of Argyna, Eupalia[2147], Phæstum, and Calamisus. Beyond are the\r\nCirrhæan plains of Phocis, the town of Cirrha[2148], and the port of\r\nChalæon[2149], seven miles from which, in the interior, is situate\r\nthe free town of Delphi[2150], at the foot of Mount Parnassus[2151],\r\nand having the most celebrated oracle of Apollo throughout the whole\r\nworld. There is the Fountain too of Castalia[2152], and the river\r\nCephisus[2153] which flows past Delphi, rising in the former city of\r\nLilæa[2154]. Besides these, there is the town of Crissa[2155] and that\r\nof Anticyra[2156], with the Bulenses[2157]; as also Naulochum[2158],\r\nPyrrha, Amphissa[2159], exempt from all tribute, Tithrone,\r\nTritea[2160], Ambrysus[2161], and Drymæa[2162], which district has also\r\nthe name of Daulis. The extremity of the gulf washes one corner of\r\nBœotia, with its towns of Siphæ[2163] and Thebes[2164], surnamed the\r\nCorsian, in the vicinity of Helicon[2165]. The third town of Bœotia\r\non this sea is that of Pagæ[2166], from which point the Isthmus of the\r\nPeloponnesus projects in the form of a neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (4.)—THE PELOPONNESUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peloponnesus, which was formerly called Apia[2167] and Pelasgia,\r\nis a peninsula, inferior in fame to no land upon the face of the\r\nearth. Situate between the two seas, the Ægean and the Ionian, it is\r\nin shape like the leaf of a plane-tree, in consequence of the angular\r\nindentations made in its shores. According to Isidorus, it is 563 miles\r\nin circumference; and nearly as much again, allowing for the sea-line\r\non the margin of its gulfs. The narrow pass at which it commences is\r\nknown by the name of the Isthmus. At this spot the two seas, which\r\nwe have previously mentioned, running from the north and the east,\r\ninvade the land from opposite sides[2168], and swallow up its entire\r\nbreadth, the result being that through these inroads in opposite\r\ndirections of such vast bodies of water, the sides of the land are\r\neaten away to such an extent, that Hellas[2169] only holds on to the\r\nPeloponnesus by the narrow neck, five miles in width, which intervenes.\r\nThe Gulfs thus formed, the one on this side, the other on that, are\r\nknown as the Corinthian[2170] and the Saronic Gulfs. The ports of\r\nLecheæ[2171], on the one side, and of Cenchreæ on the other, form the\r\nfrontiers of this narrow passage, which thus compels to a tedious and\r\nperilous circumnavigation such vessels as from their magnitude cannot\r\nbe carried across by land on vehicles. For this reason it is that both\r\nKing Demetrius[2172], Cæsar the Dictator, the prince Caius[2173], and\r\nDomitius Nero[2174], have at different times made the attempt to cut\r\nthrough this neck by forming a navigable canal; a profane design, as\r\nmay be clearly seen by the result[2175] in every one of these instances.\r\n\r\nUpon the middle of this intervening neck which we have called the\r\nIsthmus, stands the colony of Corinth, formerly known by the name\r\nof Ephyre[2176], situate upon the brow of a hill, at a distance of\r\nsixty stadia from the shore of either sea. From the heights of its\r\ncitadel, which is called Acrocorinthos, or the “Heights of Corinth,”\r\nand in which is the Fountain of Pirene, it looks down upon the two\r\nseas which lie in the opposite directions. From Leucas to Patræ upon\r\nthe Corinthian gulf is a distance of eighty-eight miles. The colony\r\nof Patræ[2177] is founded upon the most extensive promontory of the\r\nPeloponnesus, facing Ætolia and the river Evenus, the Corinthian Gulf\r\nbeing, as we have previously[2178] stated, less than a mile in width at\r\nthe entrance there, though extending in length as far as the isthmus, a\r\ndistance of eighty-five miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6. (5.)—ACHAIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe province called Achaia[2179] begins at the Isthmus; from the\r\ncircumstance of its cities being ranged in regular succession on its\r\ncoast, it formerly had the name of Ægialos[2180]. The first place there\r\nis Lecheæ, already mentioned, a port of the Corinthians; next to which\r\nis Olyros[2181], a fortress of the people of Pellene[2182]; then the\r\nformer towns of Helice and Bura[2183], and the places in which their\r\ninhabitants took refuge after their towns had been swallowed up by\r\nthe sea, Sicyon[2184] namely, Ægira[2185], Ægium, and Erineos[2186].\r\nIn the interior are Cleonæ and Hysiæ[2187]; then come the port of\r\nPanormus[2188], and Rhium already mentioned; from which promontory,\r\nPatræ, of which we have previously spoken, is distant five miles;\r\nand then the place where Pheræ[2189] stood. Of the nine mountains of\r\nAchaia, Scioessa is the most famous; there is also the Fountain of\r\nCymothoë. Beyond Patræ we find the town of Olenum[2190], the colony of\r\nDyme[2191], the places where Buprasium[2192] and Hyrmine once stood,\r\nthe Promontory of Araxus[2193], the Bay of Cyllene, and the Promontory\r\nof Chelonates, at five miles’ distance from Cyllene[2194]. There is\r\nalso the fortress of Phlius[2195]; the district around which was called\r\nby Homer Aræthyrea[2196], and, after his time, Asopis.\r\n\r\nThe territory of the Eleans then begins, who were formerly called Epei,\r\nwith the city of Elis[2197] in the interior, and, at a distance of\r\ntwelve miles from Phlius, being also in the interior, the temple of\r\nOlympian Jupiter, which by the universal celebrity of its games, gives\r\nto Greece its mode of reckoning[2198]. Here too once stood the town of\r\nPisa[2199], the river Alpheus flowing past it. On the coast there is\r\nthe Promontory of Ichthys[2200]. The river Alpheus is navigable six\r\nmiles, nearly as far as the towns of Aulon[2201] and Leprion. We next\r\ncome to the Promontory of Platanodes[2202]. All these localities lie to\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7.—MESSENIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther south is the Gulf of Cyparissus, with the city of\r\nCyparissa[2203] on its shores, the line of which is seventy-two miles\r\nin length. Then, the towns of Pylos[2204] and Methone[2205], the place\r\nwhere Helos stood, the Promontory of Acritas[2206], the Asinæan Gulf,\r\nwhich takes its name from the town of Asine[2207], and the Coronean,\r\nso called from Corone; which gulfs terminate at the Promontory of\r\nTænarum[2208]. These are all in the country of Messenia, which has\r\neighteen mountains, and the river Pamisus[2209] also. In the interior\r\nare Messene[2210], Ithome, Œchalia, Arene[2211], Pteleon, Thryon,\r\nDorion[2212], and Zancle[2213], all of them known to fame at different\r\nperiods. The margin of this gulf measures eighty miles, the distance\r\nacross being thirty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8.—LACONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Tænarum begins the territory of Laconia, inhabited by a free nation,\r\nand situate on a gulf 106 miles in circuit, and 38 across. The towns\r\nare, Tænarum[2214], Amyclæ[2215], Pheræ[2216], and Leuctra[2217];\r\nand, in the interior, Sparta[2218], Theramne[2219], and the spots\r\nwhere Cardamyle[2220], Pitane[2221], and Anthea formerly stood; the\r\nformer site of Thyrea[2222], and Gerania[2223]. Here is also Mount\r\nTaygetus[2224], the river Eurotas, the Gulf of Ægilodes[2225], the\r\ntown of Psamathus, the Gulf of Gytheum[2226], so called from the town\r\nof that name, from which place the passage is the safest across to the\r\nisland of Crete. All these places are bounded by the Promontory of\r\nMalea[2227].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9.—ARGOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next gulf, which extends as far as Scyllæum[2228], is called the\r\nArgolic Gulf, being fifty miles across, and 162 in circuit. The towns\r\nupon it are, Bœa[2229], Epidaurus[2230], surnamed Limera, Zarax[2231],\r\nand the port of Cyphanta[2232]. The rivers are the Inachus[2233] and\r\nthe Erasinus, between which lies Argos, surnamed Hippium[2234], situate\r\nbeyond the place called Lerna[2235], and at a distance of two miles\r\nfrom the sea. Nine miles farther is Mycenæ[2236], and the place where,\r\nit is said, Tiryns[2237] stood; the site, too, of Mantinea[2238]. The\r\nmountains are, Artemius, Apesantus[2239], Asterion[2240], Parparus, and\r\nsome others, eleven in number. The fountains are those of Niobe[2241],\r\nAmymone, and Psamathe.\r\n\r\nFrom Scyllæum to the Isthmus of Corinth is a distance of 177 miles. We\r\nfind here the towns of Hermione[2242], Trœzen[2243], Coryphasium[2244],\r\nand Argos, sometimes called “Inachian,” sometimes “Dipsian”[2245]\r\nArgos. Then comes the port of Schœnites[2246], and the Saronic\r\nGulf, which was formerly encircled with a grove of oaks[2247], from\r\nwhich it derives its present name, oaks in ancient Greece having\r\nbeen so called. Upon this gulf is the town of Epidaurus, famous for\r\nits temple of Æsculapius[2248], the Promontory of Spiræum[2249],\r\nthe port of Anthedus[2250], Bucephalus[2251], and then Cenchreæ,\r\npreviously mentioned, on this side of the Isthmus, with its temple of\r\nNeptune[2252], famous for the games celebrated there every five years.\r\nSo many are the gulfs which penetrate the shores of the Peloponnesus,\r\nso many the seas which howl around it. Invaded by the Ionian on the\r\nnorth, it is beaten by the Sicilian on the west, buffeted by the Cretan\r\non the south, by the Ægean on the S.E., and by the Myrtoan on the N.E.;\r\nwhich last sea begins at the Gulf of Megara, and washes all the coast\r\nof Attica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10. (6.)—ARCADIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIts interior is occupied for the greater part by Arcadia, which, remote\r\nfrom the sea on every side, was originally called Drymodes[2253], and\r\nat a later period Pelasgis. The cities of Arcadia are, Psophis[2254],\r\nMantinea[2255], Stymphalus[2256], Tegea[2257], Antigonea[2258],\r\nOrchomenus[2259], Pheneum[2260], Palantium[2261] (from which the\r\nPalatium[2262] at Rome derives its name), Megalopolis[2263],\r\nGortyna[2264], Bucolium, Carnion, Parrhasia[2265], Thelpusa[2266],\r\nMelænæ[2267], Heræa[2268], Pylæ[2269], Pallene, Agræ, Epium,\r\nCynæthæ[2270], Lepreon of Arcadia[2271], Parthenium[2272], Alea,\r\nMethydrium[2273], Enispe, Macistum, Lampia, Clitorium[2274], and\r\nCleonæ[2275]; between which two last towns is the district of Nemea,\r\ncommonly known as Bembinadia[2276].\r\n\r\nThe mountains of Arcadia are, Pholoë[2277], with a town of the same\r\nname, Cyllene[2278], Lycæus[2279], upon which is the temple of\r\nLycæan Jupiter; Mænalus[2280], Artemisius[2281], Parthenius[2282],\r\nLampeus[2283], and Nonacris[2284], besides eight others of no note.\r\nThe rivers are the Ladon[2285], which rises in the marshes of\r\nPheneus[2286], and the Erymanthus[2287], which springs from a mountain\r\nof the same name, and flows into the Alpheus.\r\n\r\nThe other cities of Achaia worthy of mention are those of the\r\nAliphiræi[2288], the Abeatæ[2289], the Pyrgenses[2290], the\r\nParoreatæ[2291], the Paragenitæ, the Tortuni, the Typanei[2292], the\r\nThriasii[2293], and the Tritienses[2294]. Domitius Nero [the emperor]\r\ngranted liberty to the whole of Achaia[2295]. The Peloponnesus, from\r\nthe Promontory of Malea to the town of Ægium[2296] on the Corinthian\r\nGulf, is 190 miles in length, and 125 miles across from Elis to\r\nEpidaurus; the distance being, from Olympia to Argos, through Arcadia,\r\nsixty-eight miles. The distance from Olympia to Phlius has been already\r\nmentioned[2297]. Throughout the whole of this region, as though nature\r\nhad been desirous to compensate for the inroads of the sea, seventy-six\r\nmountains raise their lofty heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11. (7.)—ATTICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the narrow neck of the Isthmus, Hellas begins, by our people known\r\nas Græcia. The first state that presents itself is Attica, anciently\r\ncalled Acte[2298]. It touches the Isthmus in that part of it which is\r\ncalled Megaris, from the colony of Megara[2299], lying on the opposite\r\nside to Pagæ[2300].\r\n\r\nThese two towns are situate at the spot where the Peloponnesus\r\nprojects to the greatest distance; being placed, one on each side,\r\nupon the very shoulders of Hellas as it were. The Pagæans, as well\r\nas the people of Ægosthena[2301], belong to the jurisdiction of\r\nMegara. On the coast there is the port of Schœnos[2302], the towns\r\nof Sidus[2303] and Cremmyon[2304], the Scironian Rocks[2305], six\r\nmiles in length, Geranea, Megara, and Eleusis[2306]. Œnoë[2307] and\r\nProbalinthos also formerly existed here; the ports of Piræus and\r\nPhalerum[2308] are distant from the Isthmus fifty-five miles, being\r\nunited to Athens, which lies in the interior, by a wall[2309] five\r\nmiles in length. Athens is a free city, and needs[2310] not a word\r\nmore from us in its commendation; of fame it enjoys even more than\r\nenough. In Attica there are the Fountains of Cephisia[2311], Larine,\r\nCallirrhoë Enneacrunos[2312], and the mountains of Brilessus[2313],\r\nÆgialeus, Icarius, Hymettus[2314], Lycabettus[2315], and the place\r\nwhere Ilissus[2316] stood. At the distance of forty-five miles from\r\nthe Piræus is the Promontory of Sunium[2317]. There is also the\r\nPromontory of Thoricos[2318]; Potamos[2319], Steria[2320], and\r\nBrauron[2321], once towns, the borough of Rhamnus[2322], the place\r\nwhere Marathon[2323] stood, the Thriasian[2324] plain, the town of\r\nMelite[2325], and Oropus[2326] upon the confines of Bœotia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12.—BŒOTIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this country are Anthedon[2327], Onchestus[2328], the free town\r\nof Thespiæ[2329], Lebadea[2330], and then Thebes[2331], surnamed\r\nBœotian[2332], which does not yield the palm to Athens even in\r\ncelebrity; the native land, according to the common notion, of the\r\ntwo Divinities Liber and Hercules. The birth-place of the Muses too\r\nis pointed out in the grove of Helicon. To this same Thebes also\r\nbelong the forest of Cithæron[2333], and the river Ismenus. Besides\r\nthese, there are in Bœotia the Fountains of Œdipodia, Psamathe,\r\nDirce, Epicrane, Arethusa, Hippocrene[2334], Aganippe, and Gargaphie;\r\nand, besides the mountains already mentioned, Mycalesos, Hadylius,\r\nand Acontius. The remaining towns between Megara and Thebes are\r\nEleutheræ[2335], Haliartus[2336], Platææ[2337], Pheræ, Aspledon[2338],\r\nHyle[2339], Thisbe[2340], Erythræ[2341], Glissas[2342], and Copæ[2343];\r\nnear the river Cephisus, Larymna and Anchoa[2344]; as also Medeon,\r\nPhlygone, Acræphia[2345], Coronea[2346], and Chæronea[2347]. Again,\r\non the coast and below Thebes, are Ocalea[2348], Heleon, Scolos,\r\nSchœnos[2349], Peteon[2350], Hyriæ[2351], Mycalesos[2352], Iresion,\r\nPteleon, Olyros, and Tanagra[2353], the people of which are free; and,\r\nsituate upon the very mouth of the Euripus[2354], a strait formed by\r\nthe opposite island of Eubœa, Aulis[2355], so famous for its capacious\r\nharbour. The Bœotians formerly had the name of Hyantes.\r\n\r\nAfter them come the Locrians, surnamed Epicnemidii[2356], formerly\r\ncalled Leleges, through whose country the river Cephisus passes, in its\r\ncourse to the sea. Their towns are Opus[2357]; from which the Opuntian\r\nGulf[2358] takes its name, and Cynos. Daphnus[2359] is the only town of\r\nPhocis situate on the coast. In the interior of Locris is Elatea[2360],\r\nand on the banks of the Cephisus, as we have previously stated[2361],\r\nLilæa, and, facing Delphi, Cnemisæ[2362] and Hyampolisæ[2363]. Again,\r\nupon the coast of the Locrians, are Larymna[2364], and Thronium[2365],\r\nnear which last the river Boagrius enters the sea. Also, the towns of\r\nNarycion, Alope[2366], and Scarphia[2367]; and then the gulf which\r\nreceives the name of the Maliac[2368] from the people who dwell there,\r\nand upon which are the towns of Halcyone, Econia, and Phalara[2369].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—DORIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoris comes next, in which are Sperchios[2370], Erineon[2371],\r\nBoion[2372], Pindus, and Cytinum[2373]. Behind Doris lies Mount Œta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14.—PHTHIOTIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHæmonia follows, a country which has often changed its name, having\r\nbeen successively called Pelasgic Argos, Hellas, Thessaly, and Dryopis,\r\nalways taking its surname from its kings. In this country was born\r\nthe king whose name was Græcus; and from whom Græcia was so called;\r\nand here too was born Hellen[2374], from whom the Hellenes derive\r\ntheir name. The same people Homer has called by three different names,\r\nMyrmidones, Hellenes, and Achæi.\r\n\r\nThat portion of these people which inhabit the country adjacent to\r\nDoris are called Phthiotæ. Their towns are Echinus[2375], at the mouth\r\nof the river Sperchius, and, at four miles from the narrow pass\r\nof Thermopylæ[2376], Heraclea, which from it takes its surname of\r\nTrachin[2377]. Here too is Mount Callidromus[2378], and the celebrated\r\ntowns of Hellas[2379], Halos[2380], Lamia[2381], Phthia[2382], and\r\nArne[2383].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15. (8.)—THESSALY PROPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Thessaly is Orchomenus, formerly called the Minyan[2384], and the\r\ntowns of Almon, by some called Salmon, Atrax[2385], and Pelinna;\r\nthe Fountain of Hyperia; the towns also of Pheræ[2386], at the back\r\nof which is Pieria[2387], extending to Macedonia, Larisa[2388],\r\nGomphi[2389], Thebes[2390] of Thessaly, the grove of Pteleon, the\r\nGulf of Pagasa, the town of Pagasa[2391], which was afterwards called\r\nDemetrias[2392], the Plains of Pharsalia, with a free city of similar\r\nname[2393], Crannon[2394], and Iletia. The mountains of Phthiotis\r\nare Nymphæus, once so beautiful for its garden scenery, the work of\r\nnature; Busygæus, Donacesa, Bermius[2395], Daphusa, Chimerion, Athamas,\r\nand Stephane. In Thessaly there are thirty-four, of which the most\r\nfamous are Cercetii, Olympus[2396], Pierus, and Ossa, opposite to\r\nwhich last are Pindus and Othrys, the abodes of the Lapithæ. These\r\nmountains look towards the west, Pelion[2397] towards the east, all of\r\nthem forming a curve like an amphitheatre, in the interior of which,\r\nlying before them, are no less than seventy-five cities. The rivers of\r\nThessaly are the Apidanus[2398], the Phœnix[2399], the Enipeus[2400],\r\nthe Onochonus[2401], and the Pamisus. There is also the Fountain\r\nof Messeis, and the lake Bœbeis[2402]. The river Peneus[2403] too,\r\nsuperior to all others in celebrity, takes its rise near Gomphi, and\r\nflows down a well-wooded valley between Ossa and Olympus, a distance\r\nof five hundred stadia, being navigable half that distance. The vale,\r\nfor a distance of five miles through which this river runs, is called\r\nby the name of Tempe; being a jugerum[2404] and a half nearly in\r\nbreadth, while on the right and left, the mountain chain slopes away\r\nwith a gentle elevation, beyond the range of human vision, the foliage\r\nimparting its colour to the light within. Along this vale glides the\r\nPeneus, reflecting the green tints as it rolls along its pebbly bed,\r\nits banks covered with tufts of verdant herbage, and enlivened by the\r\nmelodious warblings of the birds. The Peneus receives the river Orcus,\r\nor rather, I should say, does not receive it, but merely carries its\r\nwaters, which swim on its surface like oil, as Homer says[2405]; and\r\nthen, after a short time, rejects them, refusing to allow the waters of\r\na river devoted to penal sufferings and engendered for the Furies to\r\nmingle with his silvery streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16. (9.)—MAGNESIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Thessaly Magnesia joins, in which is the fountain of Libethra[2406].\r\nIts towns are Iolcos[2407], Hormenium, Pyrrha[2408], Methone[2409],\r\nand Olizon[2410]. The Promontory of Sepias[2411] is here situate. We\r\nthen come to the towns of Casthanea[2412] and Spalathra[2413], the\r\nPromontory of Æantium[2414], the towns of Melibœa[2415], Rhizus, and\r\nErymnæ[2416]; the mouth of the Peneus, the towns of Homolium[2417],\r\nOrthe, Thespiæ, Phalanna[2418], Thaumacie[2419], Gyrton[2420],\r\nCrannon[2421], Acharne[2422], Dotion[2423], Melitæa, Phylace[2424], and\r\nPotniæ[2425]. The length of Epirus, Achaia, Attica, and Thessaly is\r\nsaid altogether to amount to 490 miles, the breadth to 287.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17. (10.)—MACEDONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMacedonia comes next, including 150 nations, and renowned for its two\r\nkings[2426] and its former empire over the world; it was formerly known\r\nby the name of Emathia[2427]. Stretching away towards the nations\r\nof Epirus on the west it lies at the back of Magnesia and Thessaly,\r\nbeing itself exposed to the attacks of the Dardani[2428]. Pæonia and\r\nPelagonia protect its northern parts from the Triballi[2429]. Its\r\ntowns are Ægiæ[2430], at which place its kings were usually buried,\r\nBeræa[2431], and, in the country called Pieria from the grove of that\r\nname, Æginium[2432]. Upon the coast are Heraclea[2433], the river\r\nApilas[2434], the towns of Pydna[2435] and Aloros[2436], and the\r\nriver Haliacmon[2437]. In the interior are the Aloritæ[2438], the\r\nVallæi[2439], the Phylacæi, the Cyrrhestæ[2440], the Tyrissæi, the\r\ncolony of Pella[2441], and Stobi[2442], a town with the rights of Roman\r\ncitizens. Next comes Antigonea[2443], Europus[2444] upon the river\r\nAxius, and another place of the same name by which the Rhœdias flows,\r\nScydra, Eordæa, Mieza, and Gordyniæ. Then, upon the coast, Ichnæ[2445],\r\nand the river Axius; along this frontier the Dardani, the Treres[2446],\r\nand the Pieres, border on Macedonia. Leaving this river, there are the\r\nnations of Pæonia[2447], the Paroræi[2448], the Eordenses[2449], the\r\nAlmopii[2450], the Pelagones, and the Mygdones[2451].\r\n\r\nNext come the mountains of Rhodope, Scopius, and Orbelus; and,\r\nlying along the extent of country in front of these mountains, the\r\nArethusii[2452], the Antiochienses[2453], the Idomenenses[2454], the\r\nDoberi[2455], the Æstræenses, the Allantenses, the Audaristenses, the\r\nMorylli, the Garesci[2456], the Lyncestæ[2457], the Othryonei[2458],\r\nand the Amantini[2459] and Orestæ[2460], both of them free peoples; the\r\ncolonies of Bullis[2461] and Dium[2462], the Xylopolitæ, the Scotussæi,\r\na free people, Heraclea Sintica[2463], the Tymphæi[2464], and the\r\nToronæi.\r\n\r\nUpon the coast of the Macedonian Gulf there are the town of\r\nChalastra[2465], and, more inland, Piloros; also Lete, and at the\r\nextreme bend of the Gulf, Thessalonica[2466], a free city; (from this\r\nplace to Dyrrhachium it is 245 miles[2467],) and then Thermæ[2468].\r\nUpon the Gulf[2469] of Thermæ are the towns of Dicæa, Pydna[2470],\r\nDerra, Scione[2471], the Promontory of Canastræum[2472], and the towns\r\nof Pallene[2473] and Phlegra. In this region also are the mountains\r\nHypsizorus, Epitus, Halcyone, and Leoomne; the towns of Nyssos[2474],\r\nPhryxelon, Mendæ, and what was formerly Potidæa[2475] on the isthmus\r\nof Pallene, but now the Colony of Cassandria; Anthemus[2476],\r\nOlophyxus[2477], and the Gulf of Mecyberna[2478]; the towns of\r\nMiscella, Ampelos[2479], Torone[2480], Singos[2481], and the canal,\r\na mile and a half in length, by means of which Xerxes, king of the\r\nPersians, cut off Mount Athos[2482] from the main land. This mountain\r\nprojects from the level plain of the adjacent country into the sea,\r\na distance of seventy-five[2483] miles; its circumference at its\r\nbase being 150 miles in extent. There was formerly upon its summit\r\nthe town of Acroathon[2484]: the present towns are Uranopolis[2485],\r\nPalæorium, Thyssus, Cleonæ[2486], and Apollonia, the inhabitants\r\nof which have the surname of Macrobii[2487]. The town also of\r\nCassera, and then the other side of the Isthmus, after which come\r\nAcanthus[2488], Stagira[2489], Sithone[2490], Heraclea[2491], and the\r\ncountry of Mygdonia that lies below, in which are situate, at some\r\ndistance from the sea, Apollonia[2492] and Arethusa. Again, upon the\r\ncoast we have Posidium[2493], and the bay with the town of Cermorus,\r\nAmphipolis[2494], a free town, and the nation of the Bisaltæ. We\r\nthen come to the river Strymon[2495] which takes its rise in Mount\r\nHæmus[2496] and forms the boundary of Macedonia: it is worthy of remark\r\nthat it first discharges itself into seven lakes before it proceeds\r\nonward in its course.\r\n\r\nSuch is Macedonia, which was once the mistress of the world, which\r\nonce extended[2497] her career over Asia, Armenia, Iberia, Albania,\r\nCappadocia, Syria, Egypt, Taurus, and Caucasus, which reduced the\r\nwhole of the East under her power, and triumphed over the Bactri, the\r\nMedes, and the Persians. She too it was who proved the conqueror of\r\nIndia, thus treading in the footsteps of Father Liber[2498] and of\r\nHercules; and this is that same Macedonia, of which our own general\r\nPaulus Æmilius sold to pillage seventy-two[2499] cities in one day. So\r\ngreat the difference in her lot resulting from the actions of two[2500]\r\nindividuals!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18. (11.)—THRACE; THE ÆGEAN SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrace now follows, divided into fifty strategies[2501], and to be\r\nreckoned among the most powerful nations of Europe. Among its peoples\r\nwhom we ought not to omit to name are the Denseletæ and the Medi,\r\ndwelling upon the right bank of the Strymon, and joining up to the\r\nBisaltæ above[2502] mentioned; on the left there are the Digerri and\r\na number of tribes of the Bessi[2503], with various names, as far\r\nas the river Mestus[2504], which winds around the foot of Mount\r\nPangæum[2505], passing among the Elethi, the Diobessi[2506], the\r\nCarbilesi; and then the Brysæ, the Sapæi, and the Odomanti. The\r\nterritory of the Odrysæ[2507] gives birth to the Hebrus[2508], its\r\nbanks being inhabited by the Cabyleti, the Pyrogeri, the Drugeri, the\r\nCænici, the Hypsalti, the Beni, the Corpili, the Bottiæi, and the\r\nEdoni[2509]. In the same district are also the Selletæ, the Priantæ,\r\nthe Doloncæ, the Thyni, and the Greater Cœletæ, below Mount Hæmus,\r\nthe Lesser at the foot of Rhodope. Between these tribes runs the\r\nriver Hebrus. We then come to a town at the foot of Rhodope, first\r\ncalled Poneropolis[2510], afterwards Philippopolis[2511] from the\r\nname of its founder, and now, from the peculiarity of its situation,\r\nTrimontium[2512]. To reach the summit of Hæmus you have to travel\r\nsix[2513] miles. The sides of it that look in the opposite direction\r\nand slope towards the Ister are inhabited by the Mœsi[2514], the\r\nGetæ, the Aorsi, the Gaudæ, and the Clariæ; below them, are the Arræi\r\nSarmatæ[2515], also called Arreatæ, the Scythians, and, about the\r\nshores of the Euxine, the Moriseni and the Sithonii, the forefathers of\r\nthe poet Orpheus[2516], dwell.\r\n\r\nThus is Thrace bounded by the Ister on the north, by the Euxine, and\r\nthe Propontis[2517] on the east, and by the Ægean Sea on the south;\r\non the coast of which, after leaving the Strymon, we come in turn\r\nto Apollonia[2518], Œsyma[2519], Neapolis[2520] and Datos. In the\r\ninterior is the colony of Philippi[2521], distant from Dyrrhachium\r\n325 miles; also Scotussa[2522], the city of Topiris, the mouth of the\r\nriver Mestus[2523], Mount Pangæus, Heraclea[2524], Olynthos[2525],\r\nAbdera[2526], a free city, the people of the Bistones[2527] and their\r\nLake. Here was formerly the city of Tirida, which struck such terror\r\nwith its stables of the horses[2528] of Diomedes. At the present day we\r\nfind here Dicæa[2529], Ismaron[2530], the place where Parthenion stood,\r\nPhalesina, and Maronea[2531], formerly called Orthagorea. We then\r\ncome to Mount Serrium[2532] and Zone[2533], and then the place called\r\nDoriscus[2534], capable of containing ten thousand men, for it was in\r\nbodies of ten thousand that Xerxes here numbered his army. We then come\r\nto the mouth of the Hebrus[2535], the Port of Stentor, and the free\r\ntown of Ænos[2536], with the tomb there of Polydorus[2537], the region\r\nformerly of the Cicones.\r\n\r\nFrom Doriscus there is a winding coast as far as Macron Tichos[2538],\r\nor the “Long Wall,” a distance of 122 miles; round Doriscus flows the\r\nriver Melas, from which the Gulf of Melas[2539] receives its name. The\r\ntowns are, Cypsela[2540], Bisanthe[2541], and Macron Tichos, already\r\nmentioned, so called because a wall extends from that spot between the\r\ntwo seas,—that is to say, from the Propontis to the Gulf of Melas, thus\r\nexcluding the Chersonesus[2542], which projects beyond it.\r\n\r\nThe other side of Thrace now begins, on the coast[2543] of the Euxine,\r\nwhere the river Ister discharges itself; and it is in this quarter\r\nperhaps that Thrace possesses the finest cities, Histropolis[2544],\r\nnamely, founded by the Milesians, Tomi[2545], and Callatis[2546],\r\nformerly called Acervetis. It also had the cities of Heraclea and\r\nBizone, which latter was swallowed up by an earthquake; it now has\r\nDionysopolis[2547], formerly called Cruni, which is washed by the\r\nriver Zyras. All this country was formerly possessed by the Scythians,\r\nsurnamed Aroteres; their towns were, Aphrodisias, Libistos, Zygere,\r\nRocobe, Eumenia, Parthenopolis, and Gerania[2548], where a nation\r\nof Pigmies is said to have dwelt; the barbarians used to call them\r\nCattuzi, and entertain a belief that they were put to flight by cranes.\r\nUpon the coast, proceeding from Dionysopolis, is Odessus[2549], a\r\ncity of the Milesians, the river Panysus[2550], and the town of\r\nTetranaulochus. Mount Hæmus, which, with its vast chain, overhangs the\r\nEuxine, had in former times upon its summit the town of Aristæum[2551].\r\nAt the present day there are upon the coast Mesembria[2552], and\r\nAnchialum[2553], where Messa formerly stood. The region of Astice\r\nformerly had a town called Anthium; at the present day Apollonia[2554]\r\noccupies its site. The rivers here are the Panisos, the Riras, the\r\nTearus, and the Orosines; there are also the towns of Thynias[2555],\r\nHalmydessos[2556], Develton[2557], with its lake, now known as\r\nDeultum, a colony of veterans, and Phinopolis, near which last is the\r\nBosporus[2558]. From the mouth of the Ister to the entrance of the\r\nEuxine, some writers have made to be a distance of 555 miles; Agrippa,\r\nhowever, increases the length by sixty miles. The distance thence to\r\nMacron Tichos, or the Long Wall, previously mentioned, is 150 miles;\r\nand, from it to the extremity of the Chersonesus, 126.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Bosporus we come to the Gulf of Casthenes[2559], and two\r\nharbours, the one called the Old Men’s Haven, and the other the Women’s\r\nHaven. Next comes the promontory of Chrysoceras[2560], upon which is\r\nthe town of Byzantium[2561], a free state, formerly called Lygos,\r\ndistant from Dyrrhachium 711 miles,—so great being the space of land\r\nthat intervenes between the Adriatic Sea and the Propontis. We next\r\ncome to the rivers Bathynias and Pydaras[2562], or Athyras, and the\r\ntowns of Selymbria[2563] and Perinthus[2564], which join the mainland\r\nby a neck only 200 feet in width. In the interior are Bizya[2565],\r\na citadel of the kings of Thrace, and hated by the swallows, in\r\nconsequence of the sacrilegious crime of Tereus[2566]; the district\r\ncalled Cænica[2567], and the colony of Flaviopolis, where formerly\r\nstood a town called Cæla. Then, at a distance of fifty miles from\r\nBizya, we come to the colony of Apros, distant from Philippi 180 miles.\r\nUpon the coast is the river Erginus[2568]; here formerly stood the town\r\nof Ganos[2569]; and Lysimachia[2570] in the Chersonesus is being now\r\ngradually deserted.\r\n\r\nAt this spot there is another isthmus[2571], similar in name to the\r\nother[2572], and of about equal width; and, in a manner by no means\r\ndissimilar, two cities formerly stood on the shore, one on either\r\nside, Pactye on the side of the Propontis, and Cardia[2573] on that of\r\nthe Gulf of Melas, the latter deriving its name from the shape[2574]\r\nwhich the land assumes. These, however, were afterwards united with\r\nLysimachia[2575], which stands at a distance of five miles from Macron\r\nTichos. The Chersonesus formerly had, on the side of the Propontis,\r\nthe towns of Tiristasis, Crithotes, and Cissa[2576], on the banks of\r\nthe river Ægos[2577]; it now has, at a distance of twenty-two[2578]\r\nmiles from the colony of Apros, Resistos, which stands opposite to\r\nthe colony of Parium. The Hellespont also, which separates, as we\r\nhave already[2579] stated, Europe from Asia, by a channel seven\r\nstadia in width, has four cities facing each other, Callipolis[2580]\r\nand Sestos[2581] in Europe, and Lampsacus[2582] and Abydos[2583] in\r\nAsia. On the Chersonesus, there is the promontory of Mastusia[2584],\r\nlying opposite to Sigeum[2585]; upon one side of it stands the\r\nCynossema[2586] (for so the tomb of Hecuba is called), the naval\r\nstation[2587] of the Achæans, and a tower; and near it the shrine[2588]\r\nof Protesilaüs. On the extreme front of the Chersonesus, which is\r\ncalled Æolium, there is the city of Elæus. Advancing thence towards\r\nthe Gulf of Melas, we have the port of Cœlos[2589], Panormus, and then\r\nCardia, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn this manner is the third great Gulf of Europe bounded. The mountains\r\nof Thrace, besides those already mentioned, are Edonus, Gigemoros,\r\nMeritus, and Melamphyllos; the rivers are the Bargus and the Syrmus,\r\nwhich fall into the Hebrus. The length of Macedonia, Thrace, and the\r\nHellespont has been already[2590] mentioned; some writers, however,\r\nmake it 720 miles, the breadth being 384.\r\n\r\nWhat may be called a rock rather than an island, lying between Tenos\r\nand Chios, has given its name to the Ægean Sea; it has the name of\r\nÆx[2591] from its strong resemblance to a goat, which is so called in\r\nGreek, and shoots precipitately from out of the middle of the sea.\r\nThose who are sailing towards the isle of Andros from Achaia, see this\r\nrock on the left, boding no good, and warning them of its dangers.\r\nPart of the Ægean Sea bears the name of Myrtoan[2592], being so called\r\nfrom the small island [of Myrtos] which is seen as you sail towards\r\nMacedonia from Geræstus, not far from Carystus[2593] in Eubœa. The\r\nRomans include all these seas under two names,—the Macedonian, in\r\nthose parts where it touches the coasts of Macedonia or Thrace, and\r\nthe Grecian where it washes the shores of Greece. The Greeks, however,\r\ndivide the Ionian Sea into the Sicilian and the Cretan Seas, after the\r\nname of those islands; and they give the name of Icarian to that part\r\nwhich lies between Samos and Myconos. The gulfs which we have already\r\nmentioned, have given to these seas the rest of their names. Such,\r\nthen, are the seas and the various nations which are comprehended in\r\nthe third great Gulf of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19. (12.)—THE ISLANDS WHICH LIE BEFORE THE LANDS ALREADY\r\nMENTIONED.\r\n\r\n\r\nLying opposite to Thesprotia, at a distance of twelve miles from\r\nButhrotus, and of fifty from Acroceraunia, is the island of\r\nCorcyra[2594], with a city of the same name, the citizens of which\r\nare free; also a town called Cassiope[2595], and a temple dedicated\r\nto Jupiter Cassius. This island is ninety-seven miles in length, and\r\nin Homer has the names of Scheria and Phæacia; while Callimachus\r\ncalls it Drepane. There are some other islands around it, such as\r\nThoronos[2596], lying in the direction of Italy, and the two islands\r\nof Paxos[2597] in that of Leucadia, both of them five miles distant\r\nfrom Corcyra. Not far[2598] from these, and in front of Corcyra, are\r\nEricusa, Marathe, Elaphusa, Malthace, Trachie, Pythionia, Ptychia,\r\nTarachie, and, off Phalacrum[2599], a promontory of Corcyra, the rock\r\ninto which (according to the story, which arises no doubt from the\r\nsimilarity of appearance) the ship of Ulysses was changed.\r\n\r\nBefore Leucimna[2600] we find the islands of Sybota, and between\r\nLeucadia and Achaia a great number of islands, among which are those\r\ncalled Teleboïdes[2601], as also Taphiæ; by the natives, those which\r\nlie before Leucadia are called by the names of Taphias, Oxiæ, and\r\nPrinoessa[2602]; while those that are in front of Ætolia are the\r\nEchinades[2603], consisting of Ægialia, Cotonis, Thyatira, Geoaris,\r\nDionysia, Cyrnus, Chalcis, Pinara, and Mystus.\r\n\r\nIn front of these, and lying out at sea, are Cephallenia[2604] and\r\nZacynthus[2605], both of them free, Ithaca[2606], Dulichium[2607],\r\nSame[2608], and Crocyle[2609]. Cephallenia, formerly known as\r\nMelæna[2610], lies at a distance of eleven miles from Paxos, and is\r\nninety-three miles in circumference: its city of Same has been levelled\r\nto the ground by the Romans; but it still possesses three others[2611].\r\nBetween this island and Achaia lies the island of Zacynthus, remarkable\r\nfor its city of the same name, and for its singular fertility. It\r\nformerly had the name of Hyrie, and lies to the south of Cephallenia,\r\nat a distance of twenty-five miles; in it there is the famous mountain\r\nof Elatus[2612]. This island is thirty-six miles in circumference.\r\nAt a distance of fifteen miles from Zacynthus is Ithaca, in which is\r\nMount Neritus[2613]; its circumference in all is twenty-five miles.\r\nTwelve miles distant from this island is Araxus[2614], a promontory\r\nof the Peloponnesus. Before Ithaca, lying out in the main sea, are\r\nAsteris[2615] and Prote; and before Zacynthus, at a distance of\r\nthirty-five miles in the direction of the south-east wind, are the two\r\nStrophades[2616], by some known as the Plotæ. Before Cephallenia lies\r\nLetoia[2617], before Pylos the three Sphagiæ[2618], and before Messene\r\nthe Œnussæ[2619], as many in number.\r\n\r\nIn the Asinæan Gulf there are the three Thyrides[2620], and in that of\r\nLaconia Theganusa[2621], Cothon, and Cythera[2622], with the town of\r\nthat name, the former name of which island was Porphyris. It is situate\r\nfive miles from the promontory of Malea[2623], thus forming a strait\r\nvery dangerous to navigation. In the Gulf of Argolis are Pityusa[2624],\r\nIrine, and Ephyre; opposite the territory of Hermione[2625], Tiparenus,\r\nAperopia[2626], Colonis[2627], and Aristera; and, opposite that of\r\nTrœzen, Calauria[2628], at a distance of half a mile, Plateis[2629],\r\nBelbina, Lasia, and Baucidias. Opposite Epidaurus is Cecryphalos[2630],\r\nand Pityonesos[2631], six miles distant from the mainland; and, at a\r\ndistance of fifteen miles from this last, Ægina[2632], a free island,\r\nthe length of which, as you sail past it, is eighteen miles. This\r\nisland is twenty miles distant from Piræus, the port of Athens: it used\r\nformerly to be called Œnone. Opposite the promontory of Spiræum[2633],\r\nlie Eleusa[2634], Adendros[2635], the two islands called Craugiæ, the\r\ntwo Cæciæ, Selachusa, Cenchreis, and Aspis; as also, in the Gulf of\r\nMegara, the four Methurides. Ægila[2636] lies at a distance of fifteen\r\nmiles from Cythera, and of twenty-five from Phalasarna, a city of\r\nCrete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—CRETE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrete itself lies from east to west, the one side facing the south,\r\nthe other the north, and is known to fame by the renown of its hundred\r\ncities. Dosiades says, that it took its name from the nymph Crete,\r\nthe daughter of Hesperides[2637]; Anaximander, from a king of the\r\nCuretes, Philistides of Mallus * * * * *; while Crates says that it\r\nwas at first called Aëria, and after that Curetis; and some have been\r\nof opinion that it had the name of Macaron[2638] from the serenity of\r\nits climate. In breadth it nowhere exceeds fifty miles, being widest\r\nabout the middle. In length, however, it is full 270 miles, and 589\r\nin circumference, forming a bend towards the Cretan Sea, which takes\r\nits name from it. At its eastern extremity is the Promontory of\r\nSammonium[2639], facing Rhodes, while towards the west it throws out\r\nthat of Criumetopon[2640], in the direction of Cyrene.\r\n\r\nThe more remarkable cities of Crete are, Phalasarna, Etæa[2641],\r\nCisamon[2642], Pergamum, Cydonia[2643], Minoium[2644], Apteron[2645],\r\nPantomatrium, Amphimalla[2646], Rhithymna, Panormus, Cytæum, Apollonia,\r\nMatium[2647], Heraclea, Miletos, Ampelos, Hierapytna[2648],\r\nLebena[2649], and Hierapolis; and, in the interior, Gortyna[2650],\r\nPhæstum, Cnossus[2651], Polyrrenium, Myrina, Lycastus, Rhamnus,\r\nLyctus, Dium[2652], Asus, Pyloros, Rhytion, Elatos, Pharæ, Holopyxos,\r\nLasos, Eleuthernæ[2653], Therapnæ, Marathusa, and Tylisos; besides\r\nsome sixty others, of which the memory only exists. The mountains are\r\nthose of Cadistus[2654], Ida, Dictynnæus, and Corycus[2655]. This\r\nisland is distant, at its promontory of Criumetopon, according to\r\nAgrippa, from Phycus[2656], the promontory of Cyrene, 125 miles; and at\r\nCadistus, from Malea in the Peloponnesus, eighty. From the island of\r\nCarpathos[2657], at its promontory of Sammonium it lies in a westerly\r\ndirection, at a distance of sixty miles; this last-named island is\r\nsituate between it and Rhodes.\r\n\r\nThe other islands in its vicinity, and lying in front of the\r\nPeloponnesus, are the two isles known as Corycæ, and the two called\r\nMylæ[2658]. On the north side, having Crete on the right, and opposite\r\nto Cydonia, is Leuce[2659], and the two islands known as Budroæ[2660].\r\nOpposite to Matium lies Dia[2661]; opposite to the promontory of\r\nItanum[2662], Onisia and Leuce; and over against Hierapytna, Chrysa and\r\nGaudos[2663]. In the same neighbourhood, also, are Ophiussa, Butoa, and\r\nAradus; and, after doubling Criumetopon, we come to the three islands\r\nknown as Musagorus. Before the promontory of Sammonium lie the islands\r\nof Phocœ, the Platiæ, the Sirnides, Naulochos, Armedon, and Zephyre.\r\n\r\nBelonging to Hellas, but still in the Ægean Sea, we have the\r\nLichades[2664], consisting of Scarphia, Coresa, Phocaria, and many\r\nothers which face Attica, but have no towns upon them, and are\r\nconsequently of little note. Opposite Eleusis, however, is the\r\nfar-famed Salamis[2665]; before it, Psyttalia[2666]; and, at a distance\r\nof five miles from Sunium, the island of Helene[2667]. At the same\r\ndistance from this last is Ceos[2668], which some of our countrymen\r\nhave called Cea, and the Greeks Hydrussa, an island which has been\r\ntorn away from Eubœa. It was formerly 500 stadia in length; but more\r\nrecently four-fifths of it, in the direction of Bœotia, have been\r\nswallowed up by the sea. The only towns it now has left are Iulis and\r\nCarthæa[2669]; Coresus[2670] and Pœëessa[2671] have perished. Varro\r\ninforms us, that from this place there used to come a cloth of very\r\nfine texture, used for women’s dresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21.—EUBŒA.\r\n\r\n\r\nEubœa[2672] itself has also been rent away from Bœotia; the channel of\r\nthe Euripus, which flows between them, being so narrow as to admit of\r\nthe opposite shores being united by a bridge[2673]. At the south, this\r\nisland is remarkable for its two promontories, that of Geræstus[2674],\r\nwhich looks towards Attica, and that of Caphareus[2675], which faces\r\nthe Hellespont; on the north it has that of Cenæum[2676]. In no part\r\ndoes this island extend to a greater breadth than forty miles, while\r\nit never contracts to less than two. In length it runs along the\r\nwhole coast of Bœotia, extending from Attica as far as Thessaly, a\r\ndistance of 150 miles[2677]. In circumference it measures 365, and is\r\ndistant from the Hellespont, on the side of Caphareus, 225 miles. The\r\ncities for which it was formerly famous were, Pyrrha, Porthmos, Nesos,\r\nCerinthos[2678], Oreum, Dium, Ædepsos[2679], Ocha, and Œchalia; at\r\npresent it is ennobled by those of Chalcis[2680] (opposite which, on\r\nthe mainland, is Aulis), Geræstus[2681], Eretria[2682], Carystus[2683],\r\nOritanum, and Artemisium[2684]. Here are also the Fountain of\r\nArethusa[2685], the river Lelantus, and the warm springs known as\r\nEllopiæ; it is still better known, however, for the marble of Carystus.\r\nThis island used formerly to be called Chalcodontis and Macris[2686],\r\nas we learn from Dionysius and Ephorus; according to Aristides, Macra;\r\nalso, as Callidemus says, Chalcis, because copper was first discovered\r\nhere. Menæchmus says that it was called Abantias[2687], and the poets\r\ngenerally give it the name of Asopis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22.—THE CYCLADES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond Eubœa, and out in the Myrtoan[2688] Sea, are numerous other\r\nislands; but those more especially famous are, Glauconnesos and the\r\nÆgila[2689]. Off the promontory, too, of Geræstus are the Cyclades,\r\nlying in a circle around Delos, from which circumstance[2690] they\r\nderive their name. The first of them is the one called Andros[2691]\r\nwith a city of the same name, distant from Geræstus ten miles, and\r\nfrom Ceos thirty-nine. Myrsilus tells us that this island was at first\r\ncalled Cauros, and after that Antandros; Callimachus calls it Lasia,\r\nand others again Nonagria, Hydrussa, and Epagris. It is ninety-three\r\nmiles in circumference. At a distance of one mile from Andros and of\r\nfifteen from Delos, is Tenos[2692], with a city of the same name; this\r\nisland is fifteen miles in length. Aristotle says that it was formerly\r\ncalled Hydrussa, from the abundance of water found here, while some\r\nwriters call it Ophiussa[2693]. The other islands are, Myconos[2694],\r\nwith the mountain of Dimastus[2695], distant from Delos fifteen[2696]\r\nmiles; Siphnus[2697], formerly called Meropia and Acis, twenty-eight\r\nmiles in circumference; Seriphus[2698], twelve miles in circuit;\r\nPrepesinthus[2699]; Cythnos[2700]; and then, by far the most famous\r\namong the Cyclades, and lying in the very middle of them, Delos[2701]\r\nitself, so famous for its temple of Apollo, and its extensive commerce.\r\nThis island long floated on the waves, and, as tradition says, was\r\nthe only one that had never experienced an earthquake, down to the\r\ntime of M. Varro[2702]; Mucianus however has informed us, that it has\r\nbeen twice so visited. Aristotle states that this island received its\r\nname from the fact of its having so suddenly made its appearance[2703]\r\non emerging from the sea; Aglaosthenes, however, gives it the name\r\nof Cynthia, and others of Ortygia[2704], Asteria, Lagia, Chlamydia,\r\nCynthus, and, from the circumstance of fire having been first\r\ndiscovered here, Pyrpile. Its circumference is five miles only; Mount\r\nCynthus[2705] here raises his head.\r\n\r\nNext to this island is Rhene[2706], which Anticlides calls by the\r\nname of Celadussa, and Callidemus, Artemite; Scyros[2707], which the\r\nold writers have stated to be twenty miles in circumference, but\r\nMucianus 160; Oliaros[2708]; and Paros[2709], with a city of the\r\nsame name, distant from Delos thirty-eight miles, and famous for its\r\nmarble[2710]; it was first called Platea, and after that, Minois. At\r\na distance of seven miles from this last island is Naxos[2711], with\r\na town of the same name; it is eighteen miles distant from Delos.\r\nThis island was formerly called Strongyle[2712], then Dia, and then\r\nDionysias[2713], in consequence of the fruitfulness of its vineyards;\r\nothers again have called it the Lesser Sicily, or Callipolis[2714]. It\r\nis seventy-five[2715] miles in circumference—half as large again as\r\nParos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—THE SPORADES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe islands thus far are considered as belonging to the Cyclades; the\r\nrest that follow are the Sporades[2716]. These are, Helene[2717],\r\nPhacussa, Nicasia, Schinussa, Pholegandros, and, at a distance\r\nof thirty-eight miles from Naxos, Icaros[2718], which has given\r\nits name to the surrounding sea, and is the same number of miles\r\nin length[2719], with two cities, and a third now no longer in\r\nexistence: this island used formerly to be called Doliche, Macris,\r\nand Ichthyoëssa[2720]. It is situate fifty miles to the north-east of\r\nDelos, and thirty-five from the island of Samos. Between Eubœa and\r\nAndros, there is an arm of the sea ten miles in width, and from Icaros\r\nto Geræstus is a distance of 112-1/2 miles.\r\n\r\nAfter we pass these, no regular order can be well observed; the rest\r\nmust therefore be mentioned indiscriminately. There is the island\r\nof Scyros[2721], and that of Ios[2722], eighteen miles distant from\r\nNaxos, and deserving of all veneration for the tomb there of Homer; it\r\nis twenty-five miles in length, and was formerly known by the name of\r\nPhœnice; also Odia, Oletandros, and Gyara[2723], with a city of the\r\nsame name, the island being twelve miles in circumference, and distant\r\nfrom Andros sixty-two. At a distance of eighty miles from Gyara is\r\nSyrnos, then Cynæthus, Telos[2724], noted for its unguents, and by\r\nCallimachus called Agathussa, Donusa[2725], Patmos[2726], thirty miles\r\nin circumference, the Corassiæ[2727], Lebinthus[2728], Leros[2729],\r\nCinara[2730]; Sicinus[2731], formerly called Œnoë[2732]; Hieracia,\r\nalso called Onus; Casos[2733], likewise called Astrabe; Cimolus[2734],\r\nor Echinussa; and Melos[2735], with a city of that name, which island\r\nAristides calls Memblis, Aristotle Zephyria, Callimachus Mimallis,\r\nHeraclides Siphis and Acytos. This last is the most circular[2736]\r\nin form of all these islands. After this comes Machia, then Hypere,\r\nformerly Patage, or, as others have it, Platage, but now called\r\nAmorgos[2737], Polyægos[2738], Phyle, and Thera[2739], known as\r\nCalliste when it first sprang from the waves. From this, at a later\r\nperiod, the island of Therasia[2740] was torn away, and between the\r\ntwo afterwards arose Automate, also called Hiera, and Thia, which in\r\nour own times came into existence in the vicinity of these islands. Ios\r\nis distant from Thera twenty-five miles.\r\n\r\nNext to these follow Lea, Ascania[2741], Anaphe[2742], Hippuris, and\r\nAstypalæa[2743], a free state. This island is eighty-eight miles in\r\ncircumference, and 125 miles distant from Cadistus, in Crete. From\r\nAstypalæa, Platea is distant sixty miles, and Caminia thirty-eight from\r\nthis last. We then come to the islands of Azibintha, Lanise, Tragæa,\r\nPharmacussa, Techedia, Chalcia[2744], Calymna[2745], in which is the\r\ntown of Coös, Calymna, at a distance of twenty-five miles from which is\r\nCarpathum[2746], which has given its name to the Carpathian Sea. The\r\ndistance thence to Rhodes[2747], in the direction of the south-west\r\nwind, is fifty miles. From Carpathum to Casus is seven miles, and from\r\nCasus to Sammonium, the promontory of Crete, thirty[2748]. In the\r\nEuripus of Eubœa, almost at the very mouth of it, are the four islands\r\ncalled Petaliæ[2749]; and, at its outlet, Atalante[2750]. The Cyclades\r\nand the Sporades are bounded on the east by the Asiatic shores of the\r\nIcarian Sea, on the west by the Attic shores of the Myrtoan Sea, on the\r\nnorth by the Ægean, and on the south by the Cretan and Carpathian seas,\r\nextending 700 miles in length, and 200 in breadth.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf of Pagasa[2751] has in front of it Euthia[2752],\r\nCicynethus[2753], Scyros, previously mentioned[2754], and the very\r\nfurthermost of the Cyclades and Sporades, Gerontia and Scandila[2755];\r\nthe Gulf of Thermæ[2756], Iræsia, Solimnia, Eudemia, and Nea,\r\nwhich last is sacred to Minerva. Athos has before it four islands;\r\nPeparethus[2757], formerly called Evœnus, with a city of that name,\r\nat a distance from Athos of nine miles; Sciathus[2758], at a distance\r\nof fifteen, and Imbros[2759], with a city of the same name, at a\r\ndistance of eighty-eight miles. This last island is distant from\r\nMastusia, in the Chersonesus, twenty-five miles; it is sixty-two[2760]\r\nmiles in circumference, and is washed by the river Ilisus. At a\r\ndistance of twenty-two miles from it is Lemnos[2761], being distant\r\nfrom Mount Athos eighty-seven; it is 112 miles in circumference, and\r\nhas the cities of Hephæstia and Myrina[2762]; into the market-place\r\nof which last city Athos throws its shadow at the summer solstice.\r\nThe island of Thasos[2763], constituting a free state, is six miles\r\ndistant from Lemnos; it formerly had the name of Aëria, or Æthria.\r\nAbdera[2764], on the mainland, is distant from Thasos twenty-two miles,\r\nAthos sixty-two[2765]. The island of Samothrace[2766], a free state,\r\nfacing the river Hebrus, is the same distance from Thasos, being\r\nalso thirty-two[2767] miles from Imbros, twenty-two from Lemnos, and\r\nthirty-eight[2768] from the coast of Thrace; it is thirty-two miles in\r\ncircumference, and in it rises Mount Saoce[2769], ten miles in height.\r\nThis island is the most inaccessible of them all. Callimachus mentions\r\nit by its ancient name of Dardania.\r\n\r\nBetween the Chersonesus and Samothrace, at a distance of about fifteen\r\nmiles from them both, is the island of Halonnesos[2770], and beyond\r\nit Gethone, Lamponia, and Alopeconnesus[2771], not far from Cœlos, a\r\nport[2772] of the Chersonesus, besides some others of no importance.\r\nThe following names may be also mentioned, as those of uninhabited\r\nislands in this gulf, of which we have been enabled to discover the\r\nnames:—Desticos, Sarnos, Cyssiros, Charbrusa, Calathusa, Scylla,\r\nDraconon, Arconnesus, Diethusa, Scapos, Capheris, Mesate, Æantion,\r\nPateronnesos, Pateria, Calate, Neriphus, and Polendos[2773].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—THE HELLESPONT.—THE LAKE MÆOTIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth great Gulf of Europe begins at the Hellespont and ends\r\nat the entrance of the Mæotis[2774]. But in order that the several\r\nportions of the Euxine and its coasts may be the better known, we must\r\nbriefly embrace the form of it in one general view. This vast sea,\r\nlying in front of Asia, is shut out from Europe by the projection of\r\nthe shores of the Chersonesus, and effects an entrance into those\r\ncountries by a narrow channel only, of the width, as already mentioned,\r\nof seven stadia, thus separating Europe from Asia. The entrance of\r\nthese Straits is called the Hellespont; over it Xerxes, the king of the\r\nPersians, constructed a bridge of boats, across which he led his army.\r\nA narrow channel extends thence a distance of eighty-six miles, as far\r\nas Priapus[2775], a city of Asia, at which Alexander the Great passed\r\nover. At this point the sea becomes wider, and after some distance\r\nagain takes the form of a narrow strait. The wider part is known as the\r\nPropontis[2776], the Straits as the Thracian Bosporus[2777], being only\r\nhalf-a-mile in width, at the place where Darius, the father of Xerxes,\r\nled his troops across by a bridge. The extremity of this is distant\r\nfrom the Hellespont 239 miles.\r\n\r\nWe then come to the vast sea called the Euxine, which invades the land\r\nas it retreats afar, and the name of which was formerly Axenus[2778].\r\nAs the shores bend inwards, this sea with a vast sweep stretches far\r\naway, curving on both sides after the manner of a pair of horns, so\r\nmuch so that in shape it bears a distinct resemblance to a Scythian\r\nbow[2779]. In the middle of the curve it is joined by the mouth of\r\nLake Mæotis, which is called the Cimmerian[2780] Bosporus, and is two\r\nmiles and a half in width. Between the two Bospori, the Thracian and\r\nthe Cimmerian, there is a distance in a straight line, of 500 miles,\r\nas Polybius informs us. We learn from Varro and most of the ancient\r\nwriters, that the circumference of the Euxine is altogether 2150 miles;\r\nbut to this number Cornelius Nepos adds 350 more; while Artemidorus\r\nmakes it 2919 miles, Agrippa 2360, and Mucianus 2425. In a similar\r\nmanner some writers have fixed the length of the European shores of\r\nthis sea at 1478 miles, others again at 1172. M. Varro gives the\r\nmeasurement as follows:—from the mouth of the Euxine to Apollonia 187\r\nmiles, and to Callatis the same distance; thence to the mouth of the\r\nIster 125 miles; to the Borysthenes 250; to Chersonesus[2781], a town\r\nof the Heracleotæ, 325; to Panticapæum[2782], by some called Bosporus,\r\nat the very extremity of the shores of Europe, 212 miles: the whole\r\nof which added together, makes 1337[2783] miles. Agrippa makes the\r\ndistance from Byzantium to the river Ister 560 miles, and from thence\r\nto Panticapæum, 635.\r\n\r\nLake Mæotis, which receives the river Tanais as it flows from the\r\nRiphæan Mountains[2784], and forms the extreme boundary between Europe\r\nand Asia, is said to be 1406 miles in circumference; which however some\r\nwriters state at only 1125. From the entrance of this lake to the mouth\r\nof the Tanais in a straight line is, it is generally agreed, a distance\r\nof 375 miles.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the coasts of this fourth great Gulf of Europe, as\r\nfar as Istropolis, have been already[2785] mentioned in our account of\r\nThrace. Passing beyond that spot we come to the mouths of the Ister.\r\nThis river rises in Germany in the heights of Mount Abnoba[2786],\r\nopposite to Rauricum[2787], a town of Gaul, and flows for a course\r\nof many miles beyond the Alps and through nations innumerable, under\r\nthe name of the Danube. Adding immensely to the volume of its waters,\r\nat the spot where it first enters Illyricum, it assumes the name of\r\nIster, and, after receiving sixty rivers, nearly one half of which are\r\nnavigable, rolls into the Euxine by six[2788] vast channels. The first\r\nof these is the mouth of Peuce[2789], close to which is the island of\r\nPeuce itself, from which the neighbouring channel takes its name; this\r\nmouth is swallowed up in a great swamp nineteen miles in length. From\r\nthe same channel too, above Istropolis, a lake[2790] takes its rise,\r\nsixty-three miles in circuit; its name is Halmyris. The second mouth\r\nis called Naracu-Stoma[2791]; the third, which is near the island\r\nof Sarmatica, is called Calon-Stoma[2792]; the fourth is known as\r\nPseudo-Stomon[2793], with its island called Conopon-Diabasis[2794];\r\nafter which come the Boreon-Stoma[2795] and the Psilon-Stoma[2796].\r\nThese mouths are each of them so considerable, that for a distance of\r\nforty miles, it is said, the saltness of the sea is quite overpowered,\r\nand the water found to be fresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—DACIA, SARMATIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn setting out from this spot, all the nations met with are Scythian\r\nin general, though various races have occupied the adjacent shores;\r\nat one spot the Getæ[2797], by the Romans called Daci; at another\r\nthe Sarmatæ, by the Greeks called Sauromatæ, and the Hamaxobii[2798]\r\nor Aorsi, a branch of them; then again the base-born Scythians and\r\ndescendants of slaves, or else the Troglodytæ[2799]; and then, after\r\nthem, the Alani[2800] and the Rhoxalani. The higher[2801] parts again,\r\nbetween the Danube and the Hercynian Forest[2802], as far as the\r\nwinter quarters of Pannonia at Carnuntum[2803], and the borders of the\r\nGermans, are occupied by the Sarmatian Iazyges[2804], who inhabit the\r\nlevel country and the plains, while the Daci, whom they have driven\r\nas far as the river Pathissus[2805], inhabit the mountain and forest\r\nranges. On leaving the river Marus[2806], whether it is that or the\r\nDuria[2807], that separates them from the Suevi and the kingdom of\r\nVannius[2808], the Basternæ, and, after them, other tribes of the\r\nGermans occupy the opposite sides[2809]. Agrippa considers the whole of\r\nthis region, from the Ister to the ocean, to be 2100 miles in length,\r\nand 4400 miles in breadth to the river Vistula in the deserts[2810] of\r\nSarmatia. The name “Scythian” has extended, in every direction, even\r\nto the Sarmatæ and the Germans; but this ancient appellation is now\r\nonly given to those who dwell beyond those nations, and live unknown to\r\nnearly all the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—SCYTHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving the Ister, we come to the towns of Cremniscos[2811], Æpolium,\r\nthe mountains of Macrocremnus, and the famous river Tyra[2812], which\r\ngives name to a town on the spot where Ophiusa is said formerly to\r\nhave stood. The Tyragetæ inhabit a large island[2813] situate in this\r\nriver, which is distant from Pseudostomos, a mouth of the Ister,\r\nso called, 130 miles. We then come to the Axiacæ, who take their\r\nname from the river Axiaces[2814], and beyond them, the Crobyzi,\r\nthe river Rhodes[2815], the Sagarian Gulf[2816], and the port of\r\nOrdesos[2817]. At a distance of 120 miles from the Tyra is the river\r\nBorysthenes[2818], with a lake and a people of similar name, as also\r\na town[2819] in the interior, at a distance of fifteen miles from\r\nthe sea, the ancient names of which were Olbiopolis and Miletopolis.\r\nAgain, on the shore is the port of the Achæi, and the island of\r\nAchilles[2820], famous for the tomb there of that hero, and, at a\r\ndistance of 125 miles from it, a peninsula which stretches forth in the\r\nshape of a sword, in an oblique direction, and is called, from having\r\nbeen his place of exercise, Dromos Achilleos[2821]: the length of this,\r\naccording to Agrippa, is eighty miles. The Taurian Scythians and the\r\nSiraci[2822] occupy all this tract of country.\r\n\r\nAt this spot begins a well-wooded district[2823], which has given\r\nto the sea that washes its banks the name of the Hylæan Sea; its\r\ninhabitants are called Enœchadlæ[2824]. Beyond them is the river\r\nPanticapes[2825], which separates the Nomades[2826] and the Georgi, and\r\nafter it the Acesinus[2827]. Some authors say that the Panticapes flows\r\ninto the Borysthenes below Olbia[2828]. Others, who are more correct,\r\nsay that it is the Hypanis[2829]: so great is the mistake made by those\r\nwho have placed it[2830] in Asia.\r\n\r\nThe sea runs in here and forms a large gulf[2831], until there is\r\nonly an intervening space[2832] of five miles between it and the Lake\r\nMæotis, its margin forming the sea-line of extensive tracts of land,\r\nand numerous nations; it is known as the Gulf of Carcinites. Here we\r\nfind the river Pacyris[2833], the towns of Navarum and Carcine[2834],\r\nand behind it Lake Buges[2835], which discharges itself by a channel\r\ninto the sea. This Buges is separated by a ridge of rocks[2836] from\r\nCoretus, a gulf in the Lake Mæotis; it receives the rivers Buges[2837],\r\nGerrus[2838], and Hypacaris[2839], which approach it from regions that\r\nlie in various directions. For the Gerrus separates the Basilidæ from\r\nthe Nomades, the Hypacaris flows through the Nomades and the Hylæi, by\r\nan artificial channel into Lake Buges, and by its natural one into the\r\nGulf of Coretus: this region bears the name of Scythia Sindice.\r\n\r\nAt the river Carcinites, Scythia Taurica[2840] begins, which was once\r\ncovered by the sea, where we now see level plains extended on every\r\nside: beyond this the land rises into mountains of great elevation.\r\nThe peoples here are thirty in number, of which twenty-three dwell in\r\nthe interior, six of the cities being inhabited by the Orgocyni, the\r\nCharaceni[2841], the Lagyrani, the Tractari, the Arsilachitæ, and the\r\nCaliordi. The Scythotauri possess the range of mountains: on the west\r\nthey are bounded by the Chersonesus, and on the east by the Scythian\r\nSatarchæ[2842]. On the shore, after we leave Carcinites, we find the\r\nfollowing towns; Taphræ[2843], situate on the very isthmus of the\r\npeninsula, and then Heraclea Chersonesus[2844], to which its freedom\r\nhas been granted[2845] by the Romans. This place was formerly called\r\nMegarice, being the most polished city throughout all these regions, in\r\nconsequence of its strict preservation of Grecian manners and customs.\r\nA wall, five miles in length, surrounds it. Next to this comes the\r\nPromontory of Parthenium[2846], the city of the Tauri, Placia, the port\r\nof the Symboli[2847], and the Promontory of Criumetopon[2848], opposite\r\nto Carambis[2849], a promontory of Asia, which runs out in the middle\r\nof the Euxine, leaving an intervening space between them of 170 miles,\r\nwhich circumstance it is in especial that gives to this sea the form of\r\na Scythian bow. After leaving this headland we come to a great number\r\nof harbours and lakes of the Tauri[2850]. The town of Theodosia[2851]\r\nis distant from Criumetopon 125 miles, and from Chersonesus 165. Beyond\r\nit there were, in former times, the towns of Cytæ, Zephyrium, Acræ,\r\nNymphæum, and Dia. Panticapæum[2852], a city of the Milesians, by\r\nfar the strongest of them all, is still in existence; it lies at the\r\nentrance of the Bosporus, and is distant from Theodosia eighty-seven\r\nmiles and a half, and from the town of Cimmerium, which lies on the\r\nother side of the Strait, as we have previously[2853] stated, two miles\r\nand a half. Such is the width here of the channel which separates Asia\r\nfrom Europe, and which too, from being generally quite frozen over,\r\nallows of a passage on foot. The width of the Cimmerian Bosporus[2854]\r\nis twelve miles and a half: it contains the towns of Hermisium[2855],\r\nMyrmecium, and, in the interior[2856] of it, the island of Alopece.\r\nFrom the spot called Taphræ[2857], at the extremity of the isthmus,\r\nto the mouth of the Bosporus, along the line of the Lake Mæotis, is a\r\ndistance of 260 miles.\r\n\r\nLeaving Taphræ, and going along the mainland, we find in the interior\r\nthe Auchetæ[2858], in whose country the Hypanis has its rise, as\r\nalso the Neurœ, in whose district the Borysthenes has its source,\r\nthe Geloni[2859], the Thyssagetæ, the Budini, the Basilidæ, and\r\nthe Agathyrsi[2860] with their azure-coloured hair. Above them are\r\nthe Nomades, and then a nation of Anthropophagi or cannibals. On\r\nleaving Lake Buges, above the Lake Mæotis we come to the Sauromatæ\r\nand the Essedones[2861]. Along the coast, as far as the river\r\nTanais[2862], are the Mæotæ, from whom the lake derives its name,\r\nand the last of all, in the rear of them, the Arimaspi. We then come\r\nto the Riphæan[2863] mountains, and the region known by the name of\r\nPterophoros[2864], because of the perpetual fall of snow there, the\r\nflakes of which resemble feathers; a part of the world which has been\r\ncondemned by the decree of nature to lie immersed in thick darkness;\r\nsuited for nothing but the generation of cold, and to be the asylum of\r\nthe chilling blasts of the northern winds.\r\n\r\nBehind these mountains, and beyond the region of the northern winds,\r\nthere dwells, if we choose to believe it, a happy race, known as the\r\nHyperborei[2865], a race that lives to an extreme old age, and which\r\nhas been the subject of many marvellous stories[2866]. At this spot\r\nare supposed to be the hinges upon which the world revolves, and the\r\nextreme limits of the revolutions of the stars. Here we find light\r\nfor six months together, given by the sun in one continuous day, who\r\ndoes not, however, as some ignorant persons have asserted, conceal\r\nhimself from the vernal equinox[2867] to autumn. On the contrary, to\r\nthese people there is but one rising of the sun for the year, and that\r\nat the summer solstice, and but one setting, at the winter solstice.\r\nThis region, warmed by the rays of the sun, is of a most delightful\r\ntemperature, and exempt from every noxious blast. The abodes of the\r\nnatives are the woods and groves; the gods receive their worship singly\r\nand in groups, while all discord and every kind of sickness are things\r\nutterly unknown. Death comes upon them only when satiated with life;\r\nafter a career of feasting, in an old age sated with every luxury, they\r\nleap from a certain rock there into the sea; and this they deem the\r\nmost desirable mode of ending existence. Some writers have placed these\r\npeople, not in Europe, but at the very verge of the shores of Asia,\r\nbecause we find there a people called the Attacori[2868], who greatly\r\nresemble them and occupy a very similar locality. Other writers again\r\nhave placed them midway between the two suns, at the spot where it sets\r\nto the Antipodes and rises to us; a thing however that cannot possibly\r\nbe, in consequence of the vast tract of sea which there intervenes.\r\nThose writers who place them nowhere[2869] but under a day which lasts\r\nfor six months, state that in the morning they sow, at mid-day they\r\nreap, at sunset they gather in the fruits of the trees, and during the\r\nnight conceal themselves in caves. Nor are we at liberty to entertain\r\nany doubts as to the existence of this race; so many authors[2870]\r\nare there who assert that they were in the habit of sending their\r\nfirst-fruits to Delos to present them to Apollo, whom in especial they\r\nworship. Virgins used to carry them, who for many years were held in\r\nhigh veneration, and received the rites of hospitality from the nations\r\nthat lay on the route; until at last, in consequence of repeated\r\nviolations of good faith, the Hyperboreans came to the determination\r\nto deposit these offerings upon the frontiers of the people who\r\nadjoined them, and they in their turn were to convey them on to their\r\nneighbours, and so from one to the other, till they should have arrived\r\nat Delos. However, this custom, even, in time fell into disuse.\r\n\r\nThe length of Sarmatia, Scythia, and Taurica, and of the whole of the\r\nregion which extends from the river Borysthenes, is, according to\r\nAgrippa, 980 miles, and its breadth 717. I am of opinion, however, that\r\nin this part of the earth all estimates of measurement are exceedingly\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—THE ISLANDS OF THE EUXINE. THE ISLANDS OF THE NORTHERN OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now, in conformity with the plan which I originally proposed, the\r\nremaining portions of this gulf must be described. As for its seas, we\r\nhave already made mention of them.\r\n\r\n(13.) The Hellespont has no islands belonging to Europe that are worthy\r\nof mention. In the Euxine there are, at a distance of a mile and a half\r\nfrom the European shore, and of fourteen from the mouth of the Strait,\r\nthe two Cyanæan[2871] islands, by some called the Symplegades[2872],\r\nand stated in fabulous story to have run the one against the other;\r\nthe reason being the circumstance that they are separated by so short\r\nan interval, that while to those who enter the Euxine opposite to them\r\nthey appear to be two distinct islands, but if viewed in a somewhat\r\noblique direction they have the appearance of becoming gradually united\r\ninto one. On this side of the Ister there is the single island[2873]\r\nof the Apolloniates, eighty miles from the Thracian Bosporus; it was\r\nfrom this place that M. Lucullus brought the Capitoline[2874] Apollo.\r\nThose islands which are to be found between the mouths of the Ister we\r\nhave already mentioned[2875]. Before the Borysthenes is Achillea[2876]\r\npreviously referred to, known also by the names of Leuce and\r\nMacaron[2877]. Researches which have been made at the present day place\r\nthis island at a distance of 140 miles from the Borysthenes, of 120\r\nfrom Tyra, and of fifty from the island of Peuce. It is about ten miles\r\nin circumference. The remaining islands in the Gulf of Carcinites are\r\nCephalonnesos, Rhosphodusa, and Macra. Before we leave the Euxine, we\r\nmust not omit to notice the opinion expressed by many writers that all\r\nthe interior[2878] seas take their rise in this one as the principal\r\nsource, and not at the Straits of Gades. The reason they give for this\r\nsupposition is not an improbable one—the fact that the tide is always\r\nrunning out of the Euxine and that there is never any ebb.\r\n\r\nWe must now leave the Euxine to describe the outer portions[2879] of\r\nEurope. After passing the Riphæan mountains we have now to follow\r\nthe shores of the Northern Ocean on the left, until we arrive at\r\nGades. In this direction a great number of islands[2880] are said to\r\nexist that have no name; among which there is one which lies opposite\r\nto Scythia, mentioned under the name of Raunonia[2881], and said\r\nto be at a distance of the day’s sail from the mainland; and upon\r\nwhich, according to Timæus, amber is thrown up by the waves in the\r\nspring season. As to the remaining parts of these shores, they are\r\nonly known from reports of doubtful authority. With reference to the\r\nSeptentrional[2882] or Northern Ocean; Hecatæus calls it, after we\r\nhave passed the mouth of the river Parapanisus, where it washes the\r\nScythian shores, the Amalchian sea, the word ‘Amalchian’ signifying\r\nin the language of these races, frozen. Philemon again says that it\r\nis called Morimarusa or the “Dead Sea” by the Cimbri, as far as the\r\nPromontory of Rubeas, beyond which it has the name of the Cronian[2883]\r\nSea. Xenophon of Lampsacus tells us that at a distance of three days’\r\nsail from the shores of Scythia, there is an island of immense size\r\ncalled Baltia[2884], which by Pytheas is called Basilia[2885]. Some\r\nislands[2886] called Oönæ are said to be here, the inhabitants of\r\nwhich live on the eggs of birds and oats; and others again upon which\r\nhuman beings are produced with the feet of horses, thence called\r\nHippopodes. Some other islands are also mentioned as those of the\r\nPanotii, the people of which have ears of such extraordinary size as to\r\ncover the rest of the body, which is otherwise left naked.\r\n\r\nLeaving these however, we come to the nation of the Ingævones[2887],\r\nthe first in Germany; at which we begin to have some information\r\nupon which more implicit reliance can be placed. In their country is\r\nan immense mountain called Sevo[2888], not less than those of the\r\nRiphæan range, and which forms an immense gulf along the shore as\r\nfar as the Promontory of the Cimbri. This gulf, which has the name\r\nof the ‘Codanian,’ is filled with islands; the most famous among\r\nwhich is Scandinavia[2889], of a magnitude as yet unascertained: the\r\nonly portion of it at all known is inhabited by the nation of the\r\nHilleviones, who dwell in 500 villages, and call it a second world: it\r\nis generally supposed that the island of Eningia[2890] is of not less\r\nmagnitude. Some writers state that these regions, as far as the river\r\nVistula, are inhabited by the Sarmati, the Venedi[2891], the Sciri,\r\nand the Hirri[2892], and that there is a gulf there known by the name\r\nof Cylipenus[2893], at the mouth of which is the island of Latris,\r\nafter which comes another gulf, that of Lagnus, which borders on the\r\nCimbri. The Cimbrian Promontory, running out into the sea for a great\r\ndistance, forms a peninsula which bears the name of Cartris[2894].\r\nPassing this coast, there are three and twenty islands which have\r\nbeen made known by the Roman arms[2895]: the most famous of which is\r\nBurcana[2896], called by our people Fabaria, from the resemblance\r\nborne[2897] by a fruit which grows there spontaneously. There are those\r\nalso called Glæsaria[2898] by our soldiers, from their amber; but by\r\nthe barbarians they are known as Austeravia and Actania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole of the shores of this sea as far as the Scaldis[2899], a\r\nriver of Germany, is inhabited by nations, the dimensions of whose\r\nrespective territories it is quite impossible to state, so immensely\r\ndo the authors differ who have touched upon this subject. The Greek\r\nwriters and some of our own countrymen have stated the coast of\r\nGermany to be 2500 miles in extent, while Agrippa, comprising Rhætia\r\nand Noricum in his estimate, makes the length to be 686[2900] miles,\r\nand the breadth 148[2901]. (14.) The breadth of Rhætia alone however\r\nvery nearly exceeds that number of miles, and indeed we ought to state\r\nthat it was only subjugated at about the period of the death of that\r\ngeneral; while as for Germany, the whole of it was not thoroughly known\r\nto us for many years after his time. If I may be allowed to form a\r\nconjecture, the margin of the coast will be found to be not far short\r\nof the estimate of the Greek writers, while the distance in a straight\r\nline will nearly correspond with that mentioned by Agrippa.\r\n\r\nThere are five German races; the Vandili[2902], parts of whom are\r\nthe Burgundiones[2903], the Varini[2904], the Carini[2905], and the\r\nGutones[2906]: the Ingævones, forming a second race, a portion of\r\nwhom are the Cimbri[2907], the Teutoni[2908], and the tribes of the\r\nChauci[2909]. The Istævones[2910], who join up to the Rhine, and to\r\nwhom the Cimbri[2911] belong, are the third race; while the Hermiones,\r\nforming a fourth, dwell in the interior, and include the Suevi[2912],\r\nthe Hermunduri[2913], the Chatti[2914], and the Cherusci[2915]: the\r\nfifth race is that of the Peucini[2916], who are also the Basternæ,\r\nadjoining the Daci previously mentioned. The more famous rivers\r\nthat flow into the ocean are the Guttalus[2917], the Vistillus or\r\nVistula, the Albis[2918], the Visurgis[2919], the Amisius[2920], the\r\nRhine, and the Mosa[2921]. In the interior is the long extent of the\r\nHercynian[2922] range, which in grandeur is inferior to none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29. (15.)—NINETY-SIX ISLANDS OF THE GALLIC OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Rhine itself, nearly 100 miles in length, is the most famous\r\nisland[2923] of the Batavi and the Canninefates, as also other\r\nislands of the Frisii[2924], the Chauci, the Frisiabones[2925], the\r\nSturii[2926], and the Marsacii, which lie between Helium[2927] and\r\nFlevum[2928]. These are the names of the mouths into which the Rhine\r\ndivides itself, discharging its waters on the north into the lakes\r\nthere, and on the west into the river Mosa. At the middle mouth which\r\nlies between these two, the river, having but a very small channel,\r\npreserves its own name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30. (16.)—BRITANNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpposite to this coast is the island called Britannia, so celebrated\r\nin the records of Greece[2929] and of our own country. It is situate\r\nto the north-west, and, with a large tract of intervening sea, lies\r\nopposite to Germany, Gaul, and Spain, by far the greater part of\r\nEurope. Its former name was Albion[2930]; but at a later period, all\r\nthe islands, of which we shall just now briefly make mention, were\r\nincluded under the name of “Britanniæ.” This island is distant from\r\nGesoriacum, on the coast of the nation of the Morini[2931], at the\r\nspot where the passage across is the shortest, fifty miles. Pytheas\r\nand Isidorus say that its circumference is 4875 miles. It is barely\r\nthirty years since any extensive knowledge of it was gained by the\r\nsuccesses of the Roman arms, and even as yet they have not penetrated\r\nbeyond the vicinity of the Caledonian[2932] forest. Agrippa believes\r\nits length to be 800 miles, and its breadth 300; he also thinks that\r\nthe breadth of Hibernia is the same, but that its length is less by\r\n200 miles. This last island is situate beyond Britannia, the passage\r\nacross being the shortest from the territory of the Silures[2933],\r\na distance of thirty miles. Of the remaining islands none is said\r\nto have a greater circumference than 125 miles. Among these there\r\nare the Orcades[2934], forty in number, and situate within a short\r\ndistance of each other, the seven islands called Acmodæ[2935], the\r\nHæbudes, thirty in number, and, between Hibernia and Britannia, the\r\nislands of Mona[2936], Monapia[2937], Ricina[2938], Vectis[2939],\r\nLimnus[2940], and Andros[2941]. Below it are the islands called Samnis\r\nand Axantos[2942], and opposite, scattered in the German Sea, are those\r\nknown as the Glæsariæ[2943], but which the Greeks have more recently\r\ncalled the Electrides, from the circumstance of their producing\r\n_electrum_ or amber. The most remote of all that we find mentioned is\r\nThule[2944], in which, as we have previously stated[2945], there is no\r\nnight at the summer solstice, when the sun is passing through the sign\r\nof Cancer, while on the other hand at the winter solstice there is no\r\nday. Some writers are of opinion that this state of things lasts for\r\nsix whole months together. Timæus the historian says that an island\r\ncalled Mictis[2946] is within six days’ sail of Britannia, in which\r\nwhite lead[2947] is found; and that the Britons sail over to it in\r\nboats of osier[2948], covered with sewed hides. There are writers also\r\nwho make mention of some other islands, Scandia[2949] namely, Dumna,\r\nBergos, and, greater than all, Nerigos, from which persons embark for\r\nThule. At one day’s sail from Thule is the frozen ocean, which by some\r\nis called the Cronian Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31. (17.)—GALLIA BELGICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole of Gaul that is comprehended under the one general name of\r\n_Comata_[2950], is divided into three races of people, which are more\r\nespecially kept distinct from each other by the following rivers. From\r\nthe Scaldis to the Sequana[2951] it is Belgic Gaul; from the Sequana\r\nto the Garumna[2952] it is Celtic Gaul or Lugdunensis[2953]; and from\r\nthe Garumna to the promontory of the Pyrenæan range it is Aquitanian\r\nGaul, formerly called Aremorica[2954]. Agrippa makes the entire length\r\nof the coast of Gaul to be 1800 miles, measured from the Rhine to the\r\nPyrenees: and its length, from the ocean to the mountains of Gebenna\r\nand Jura, excluding therefrom Gallia Narbonensis, he computes at 420\r\nmiles, the breadth being 318.\r\n\r\nBeginning at the Scaldis, the parts beyond[2955] are inhabited by the\r\nToxandri, who are divided into various peoples with many names; after\r\nwhom come the Menapii[2956], the Morini[2957], the Oromarsaci[2958],\r\nwho are adjacent to the burgh which is known as Gesoriacum[2959],\r\nthe Britanni[2960], the Ambiani[2961], the Bellovaci[2962], the\r\nHassi[2963], and, more in the interior, the Catoslugi[2964], the\r\nAtrebates[2965], the Nervii[2966], a free people, the Veromandui[2967],\r\nthe Suæuconi[2968], the Suessiones[2969], a free people, the\r\nUlmanetes[2970], a free people, the Tungri[2971], the Sunuci[2972], the\r\nFrisiabones[2973], the Betasi[2974], the Leuci[2975], a free people,\r\nthe Treveri[2976], who were formerly free, and the Lingones[2977],\r\na federal state, the federal Remi[2978], the Mediomatrici[2979], the\r\nSequani[2980], the Raurici[2981], and the Helvetii[2982]. The Roman\r\ncolonies are Equestris[2983] and Rauriaca[2984]. The nations of\r\nGermany which dwell in this province, near the sources of the Rhine,\r\nare the Nemetes[2985], the Triboci[2986], and the Vangiones[2987];\r\nnearer again[2988], the Ubii[2989], the Colony[2990] of Agrippina, the\r\nCugerni[2991], the Batavi[2992], and the peoples whom we have already\r\nmentioned as dwelling on the islands of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32. (18.)—GALLIA LUGDUNENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat part of Gaul which is known as Lugdunensis[2993] contains\r\nthe Lexovii[2994], the Vellocasses[2995], the Galeti[2996], the\r\nVeneti[2997], the Abrincatui[2998], the Ossismi[2999], and the\r\ncelebrated river Ligeris[3000], as also a most remarkable peninsula,\r\nwhich extends into the ocean at the extremity[3001] of the territory\r\nof the Ossismi, the circumference of which is 625[3002] miles, and its\r\nbreadth at the neck 125[3003]. Beyond this are the Nannetes[3004],\r\nand in the interior are the Ædui[3005], a federal people, the\r\nCarnuti[3006], a federal people, the Boii[3007], the Senones[3008],\r\nthe Aulerci, both those surnamed Eburovices[3009] and those called\r\nCenomanni[3010], the Meldi[3011], a free people, the Parisii[3012],\r\nthe Tricasses[3013], the Andecavi[3014], the Viducasses[3015],\r\nthe Bodiocasses[3016], the Venelli[3017], the Cariosvelites[3018],\r\nthe Diablinti[3019], the Rhedones[3020], the Turones[3021], the\r\nAtesui[3022], and the Secusiani[3023], a free people, in whose\r\nterritory is the colony of Lugdunum[3024].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33. (19.)—GALLIA AQUITANICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Aquitanica are the Ambilatri[3025], the Anagnutes[3026], the\r\nPictones[3027], the Santoni[3028], a free people, the Bituriges[3029],\r\nsurnamed Vivisci, the Aquitani[3030], from whom the province derives\r\nits name, the Sediboviates[3031], the Convenæ[3032], who together form\r\none town, the Begerri[3033], the Tarbelli Quatuorsignani[3034], the\r\nCocosates Sexsignani[3035], the Venami[3036], the Onobrisates[3037],\r\nthe Belendi[3038], and then the Pyrenæan range. Below these\r\nare the Monesi[3039], the Oscidates[3040] a mountain race, the\r\nSibyllates[3041], the Camponi[3042], the Bercorcates[3043],\r\nthe Pindedunni[3044], the Lassunni[3045], the Vellates[3046],\r\nthe Tornates[3047], the Consoranni[3048], the Ausci[3049], the\r\nElusates[3050], the Sottiates[3051], the Oscidates Campestres[3052],\r\nthe Succasses[3053], the Tarusates[3054], the Basabocates[3055], the\r\nVassei[3056], the Sennates, and the Cambolectri Agessinates[3057].\r\nJoining up to the Pictones are the Bituriges[3058], a free people,\r\nwho are also known as the Cubi, and then the Lemovices[3059], the\r\nArverni[3060], a free people, and the Gabales[3061].\r\n\r\nAgain, adjoining the province of Narbonensis are the Ruteni[3062],\r\nthe Cadurci[3063], the Nitiobriges[3064], and the Petrocori[3065],\r\nseparated by the river Tarnis from the Tolosani. The seas around the\r\ncoast are the Northern Ocean, flowing up to the mouth of the Rhine,\r\nthe Britannic Ocean between the Rhine and the Sequana, and, between it\r\nand the Pyrenees, the Gallic Ocean. There are many islands belonging\r\nto the Veneti, which bear the name of “Veneticæ[3066],” as also in the\r\nAquitanic Gulf, that of Uliarus[3067].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34. (20.)—NEARER SPAIN, ITS COAST ALONG THE GALLIC OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Promontory of the Pyrenees Spain begins, more narrow, not only\r\nthan Gaul, but even than itself[3068] in its other parts, as we have\r\npreviously mentioned[3069], seeing to what an immense extent it is\r\nhere hemmed in by the ocean on the one side, and by the Iberian Sea\r\non the other. A chain of the Pyrenees, extending from due east to\r\nsouth-west[3070], divides Spain into two parts, the smaller one to\r\nthe north, the larger to the south. The first coast that presents\r\nitself is that of the Nearer Spain, otherwise called Tarraconensis.\r\nOn leaving the Pyrenees and proceeding along the coast, we meet with\r\nthe forest ranges of the Vascones[3071], Olarso[3072], the towns of\r\nthe Varduli[3073], the Morosgi[3074], Menosca[3075], Vesperies[3076],\r\nand the Port of Amanus[3077], where now stands the colony of\r\nFlaviobriga. We then come to the district of the nine states of the\r\nCantabri[3078], the river Sauga[3079], and the Port of Victoria of the\r\nJuliobrigenses[3080], from which place the sources of the Iberus[3081]\r\nare distant forty miles. We next come to the Port of Blendium[3082],\r\nthe Orgenomesci[3083], a people of the Cantabri, Vereasueca[3084]\r\ntheir port, the country of the Astures[3085], the town of\r\nNoega[3086], and on a peninsula[3087], the Pæsici. Next to these we\r\nhave, belonging to the jurisdiction of Lucus[3088], after passing\r\nthe river Navilubio[3089], the Cibarci[3090], the Egovarri, surnamed\r\nNamarini, the Iadoni, the Arrotrebæ[3091], the Celtic Promontory,\r\nthe rivers Florius[3092] and Nelo, the Celtici[3093], surnamed Neri,\r\nand above them the Tamarici[3094], in whose peninsula[3095] are the\r\nthree altars called Sestianæ, and dedicated[3096] to Augustus; the\r\nCapori[3097], the town of Noela[3098], the Celtici surnamed Præsamarci,\r\nand the Cileni[3099]: of the islands, those worthy of mention are\r\nCorticata[3100] and Aunios. After passing the Cileni, belonging to\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Bracari[3101], we have the Heleni[3102], the\r\nGravii[3103], and the fortress of Tyde, all of them deriving their\r\norigin from the Greeks. Also, the islands called Cicæ[3104], the\r\nfamous city of Abobrica[3105], the river Minius[3106], four miles wide\r\nat its mouth, the Leuni, the Seurbi[3107], and Augusta[3108], a town\r\nof the Bracari, above whom lies Gallæcia. We then come to the river\r\nLimia[3109], and the river Durius[3110], one of the largest in Spain,\r\nand which rises in the district of the Pelendones[3111], passes near\r\nNumantia, and through the Arevaci and the Vaccæi, dividing the Vettones\r\nfrom Asturia, the Gallæci from Lusitania, and separating the Turduli\r\nfrom the Bracari. The whole of the region here mentioned from the\r\nPyrenees is full of mines of gold, silver, iron, and lead, both black\r\nand white[3112].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35. (21.)—LUSITANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter passing the Durius, Lusitania[3113] begins. We here have\r\nthe ancient Turduli[3114], the Pæsuri, the river Vaga[3115], the\r\ntown of Talabrica, the town and river[3116] of Æminium, the towns\r\nof Conimbrica[3117], Collippo[3118], and Eburobritium[3119]. A\r\npromontory[3120] then advances into the sea in shape of a large\r\nhorn; by some it has been called Artabrum[3121], by others the Great\r\nPromontory, while many call it the Promontory of Olisipo, from the\r\ncity[3122] near it. This spot forms a dividing line in the land, the\r\nsea, and the heavens. Here ends one side[3123] of Spain; and, when we\r\nhave doubled the promontory, the front of Spain begins. (22.) On one\r\nside of it lie the North and the Gallic Ocean, on the other the West\r\nand the Atlantic. The length of this promontory has been estimated\r\nby some persons at sixty miles, by others at ninety. A considerable\r\nnumber of writers estimate the distance from this spot to the Pyrenees\r\nat 1250 miles; and, committing a manifest error, place here the nation\r\nof the Artabri, a nation that never[3124] was here. For, making a\r\nslight change in the name, they have placed at this spot the Arrotrebæ,\r\nwhom we have previously spoken of as dwelling in front of the Celtic\r\nPromontory.\r\n\r\nMistakes have also been made as to the more celebrated rivers. From\r\nthe Minius, which we have previously mentioned, according to Varro,\r\nthe river Æminius[3125] is distant 200 miles, which others[3126]\r\nsuppose to be situate elsewhere, and called Limæa. By the ancients it\r\nwas called the “River of Oblivion,” and it has been made the subject\r\nof many fabulous stories. At a distance of 200 miles from the Durius\r\nis the Tagus, the Munda[3127] lying between them. The Tagus is famous\r\nfor its golden sands[3128]. At a distance of 160 miles from it is the\r\nSacred Promontory[3129], projecting from nearly the very middle of the\r\nfront[3130] of Spain. From this spot to the middle of the Pyrenees,\r\nVarro says, is a distance of 1400 miles; while to the Anas, by which we\r\nhave mentioned[3131] Lusitania as being separated from Bætica, is 126\r\nmiles, it being 102 more to Gades.\r\n\r\nThe peoples are the Celtici, the Turduli, and, about the Tagus, the\r\nVettones[3132]. From the river Anas to the Sacred Promontory[3133] are\r\nthe Lusitani. The cities worthy of mention on the coast, beginning\r\nfrom the Tagus, are that of Olisipo[3134], famous for its mares, which\r\nconceive[3135] from the west wind; Salacia[3136], which is surnamed\r\nthe Imperial City; Merobrica[3137]; and then the Sacred Promontory,\r\nwith the other known by the name of Cuneus[3138], and the towns of\r\nOssonoba[3139], Balsa[3140], and Myrtili[3141].\r\n\r\nThe whole of this province is divided into three jurisdictions, those\r\nof Emerita, Pax, and Scalabis. It contains in all forty-six peoples,\r\namong whom there are five colonies, one municipal town of Roman\r\ncitizens, three with the ancient Latin rights, and thirty-six that are\r\ntributaries. The colonies are those of Augusta Emerita[3142], situate\r\non the river Anas, Metallinum[3143], Pax[3144], and Norba[3145],\r\nsurnamed Cæsariana. To this last place of jurisdiction the people\r\nof Castra Servilia[3146] and Castra Cæcilia[3147] resort. The fifth\r\njurisdiction is that of Scalabis[3148], which also has the name of\r\nPræsidium Julium[3149]. Olisipo, surnamed Felicitas Julia[3150],\r\nis a municipal city, whose inhabitants enjoy the rights of Roman\r\ncitizens. The towns in the enjoyment of the ancient Latin rights are\r\nEbora[3151], which also has the name of Liberalitas Julia[3152],\r\nand Myrtili and Salacia, which we have previously mentioned. Those\r\namong the tributaries whom it may not be amiss to mention, in\r\naddition to those already[3153] alluded to among the names of those\r\nin Bætica, are the Augustobrigenses[3154], the Ammienses[3155], the\r\nAranditani, the Arabricenses, the Balsenses, the Cæsarobricenses, the\r\nCaperenses[3156], the Caurenses[3157], the Colarni, the Cibilitani,\r\nthe Concordienses[3158], the Elbocorii, the Interannienses, the\r\nLancienses[3159], the Mirobrigenses, surnamed[3160] Celtici, the\r\nMedubrigenses[3161], surnamed Plumbarii, the Ocelenses[3162] or\r\nLancienses, the Turduli, also called Barduli, and the Tapori. Agrippa\r\nstates, that Lusitania, with Asturia and Gallæcia, is 540 miles in\r\nlength, and 536 in breadth. The provinces of Spain, measured from the\r\ntwo extreme[3163] promontories of the Pyrenees, along the sea-line of\r\nthe entire coast, are thought to be 3922 miles in circumference; while\r\nsome writers make them to be but 2600.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36.—THE ISLANDS IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpposite to Celtiberia are a number of islands, by the Greeks called\r\nCassiterides[3164], in consequence of their abounding in tin: and,\r\nfacing the Promontory[3165] of the Arrotrebæ, are the six Islands of\r\nthe Gods, which some persons have called the Fortunate Islands[3166].\r\nAt the very commencement of Bætica, and twenty-five miles from\r\nthe mouth of the Straits of Gades, is the island of Gadis, twelve\r\nmiles long and three broad, as Polybius states in his writings. At\r\nits nearest part, it is less than 700 feet[3167] distant from the\r\nmainland, while in the remaining portion it is distant more than\r\nseven miles. Its circuit is fifteen miles, and it has on it a city\r\nwhich enjoys the rights of Roman citizens[3168], and whose people\r\nare called the Augustani of the city of Julia Gaditana. On the side\r\nwhich looks towards Spain, at about 100 paces distance, is another\r\nlong island, three miles wide, on which the original city of Gades\r\nstood. By Ephorus and Philistides it is called Erythia, by Timæus and\r\nSilenus Aphrodisias[3169], and by the natives the Isle of Juno. Timæus\r\nsays, that the larger island used to be called Cotinusa[3170], from\r\nits olives; the Romans call it Tartessos[3171]; the Carthaginians\r\nGadir[3172], that word in the Punic language signifying a hedge. It\r\nwas called Erythia because the Tyrians, the original ancestors of the\r\nCarthaginians, were said to have come from the Erythræan, or Red Sea.\r\nIn this island Geryon is by some thought to have dwelt, whose herds\r\nwere carried off by Hercules. Other persons again think, that his\r\nisland is another one, opposite to Lusitania, and that it was there\r\nformerly called by that name[3173].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37. (23.)—THE GENERAL MEASUREMENT OF EUROPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus made the circuit of Europe, we must now give the complete\r\nmeasurement of it, in order that those who wish to be acquainted\r\nwith this subject may not feel themselves at a loss. Artemidorus and\r\nIsidorus have given its length, from the Tanais to Gades, as 8214\r\nmiles. Polybius in his writings has stated the breadth of Europe, in\r\na line from Italy to the ocean, to be 1150 miles. But, even in his\r\nday, its magnitude was but little known. The distance of Italy, as\r\nwe have previously[3174] stated, as for as the Alps, is 1120 miles,\r\nfrom which, through Lugdunum to the British port of the Morini[3175],\r\nthe direction which Polybius seems to follow, is 1168 miles. But the\r\nbetter ascertained, though greater length, is that taken from the Alps\r\nthrough the Camp of the Legions[3176] in Germany, in a north-westerly\r\ndirection, to the mouth of the Rhine, being 1543 miles. We shall now\r\nhave to speak of Africa and Asia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Towns and nations mentioned * * * *.

It has Egypt\r\nfor its boundary, and no part of the earth is there that has fewer\r\ngulfs or inlets, its shores extending in a lengthened line from the\r\nwest in an oblique direction. The names of its peoples, and its cities\r\nin especial, cannot possibly be pronounced with correctness, except by\r\nthe aid of their own native tongues. Its population, too, for the most\r\npart dwells only in fortresses[3233].\r\n\r\n(1.) On our entrance into Africa, we find the two Mauritanias, which,\r\nuntil the time of Caius Cæsar[3234], the son of Germanicus, were\r\nkingdoms; but, suffering under his cruelty, they were divided into two\r\nprovinces. The extreme promontory of Africa, which projects into the\r\nocean, is called Ampelusia[3235] by the Greeks. There were formerly\r\ntwo towns, Lissa and Cotte[3236], beyond the Pillars of Hercules;\r\nbut, at the present day, we only find that of Tingi[3237], which was\r\nformerly founded by Antæus, and afterwards received the name of\r\nTraducta Julia[3238], from Claudius Cæsar, when he established a colony\r\nthere. It is thirty miles distant from Belon[3239], a town of Bætica,\r\nwhere the passage across is the shortest. At a distance of twenty-five\r\nmiles from Tingi, upon the shores of the ocean[3240], we come to Julia\r\nConstantia Zilis[3241], a colony of Augustus. This place is exempt from\r\nall subjection to the kings of Mauritania, and is included in the legal\r\njurisdiction of Bætica. Thirty-two miles distant from Julia Constantia\r\nis Lixos[3242], which was made a Roman colony by Claudius Cæsar, and\r\nwhich has been the subject of such wondrous fables, related by the\r\nwriters of antiquity. At this place, according to the story, was the\r\npalace of Antæus; this was the scene of his combat with Hercules, and\r\nhere were the gardens of the Hesperides[3243]. An arm of the sea flows\r\ninto the land here, with a serpentine channel, and, from the nature\r\nof the locality, this is interpreted at the present day as having been\r\nwhat was really represented by the story of the dragon keeping guard\r\nthere. This tract of water surrounds an island, the only spot which\r\nis never overflowed by the tides of the sea, although not quite so\r\nelevated as the rest of the land in its vicinity. Upon this island,\r\nalso, there is still in existence the altar of Hercules; but of the\r\ngrove that bore the golden fruit, there are no traces left, beyond some\r\nwild olive-trees. People will certainly be the less surprised at the\r\nmarvellous falsehoods of the Greeks, which have been related about this\r\nplace and the river Lixos[3244], when they reflect that some of our\r\nown[3245] countrymen as well, and that too very recently, have related\r\nstories in reference to them hardly less monstrous; how that this city\r\nis remarkable for its power and extensive influence, and how that it is\r\neven greater than Great Carthage ever was; how, too, that it is situate\r\njust opposite to Carthage, and at an almost immeasurable distance from\r\nTingi, together with other details of a similar nature, all of which\r\nCornelius Nepos has believed with the most insatiate credulity[3246].\r\n\r\nIn the interior, at a distance of forty miles from Lixos, is\r\nBabba[3247], surnamed Julia Campestris, another colony of Augustus;\r\nand, at a distance of seventy-five, a third, called Banasa[3248],\r\nwith the surname of Valentia. At a distance of thirty-five miles from\r\nthis last is the town of Volubilis, which is just that distance also\r\nfrom both[3249] seas. On the coast, at a distance of fifty miles from\r\nLixos, is the river Subur[3250], which flows past the colony of Banasa,\r\na fine river, and available for the purposes of navigation. At the\r\nsame distance from it is the city of Sala[3251], situate on a river\r\nwhich bears the same name, a place which stands upon the very verge of\r\nthe desert, and though infested by troops of elephants, is much more\r\nexposed to the attacks of the nation of the Autololes, through whose\r\ncountry lies the road to Mount Atlas, the most fabulous[3252] locality\r\neven in Africa.\r\n\r\nIt is from the midst of the sands, according to the story, that this\r\nmountain[3253] raises its head to the heavens; rugged and craggy on the\r\nside which looks toward the shores of the ocean to which it has given\r\nits name, while on that which faces the interior of Africa it is shaded\r\nby dense groves of trees, and refreshed by flowing streams; fruits of\r\nall kinds springing up there spontaneously to such an extent, as to\r\nmore than satiate every possible desire. Throughout the daytime, no\r\ninhabitant is to be seen; all is silent, like that dreadful stillness\r\nwhich reigns in the desert. A religious horror steals imperceptibly\r\nover the feelings of those who approach, and they feel themselves\r\nsmitten with awe at the stupendous aspect of its summit, which reaches\r\nbeyond the clouds, and well nigh approaches the very orb of the moon.\r\nAt night, they say, it gleams with fires innumerable lighted up; it is\r\nthen the scene of the gambols of the Ægipans[3254] and the Satyr crew,\r\nwhile it re-echoes with the notes of the flute and the pipe, and the\r\nclash of drums and cymbals. All this is what authors of high character\r\nhave stated, in addition to the labours which Hercules and Perseus\r\nthere experienced. The space which intervenes before you arrive at this\r\nmountain is immense, and the country quite unknown.\r\n\r\nThere formerly existed some Commentaries written by Hanno[3255], a\r\nCarthaginian general, who was commanded, in the most flourishing times\r\nof the Punic state, to explore the sea-coast of Africa. The greater\r\npart of the Greek and Roman writers have followed him, and have\r\nrelated, among other fabulous stories, that many cities there were\r\nfounded by him, of which no remembrance, nor yet the slightest vestige,\r\nnow exists.\r\n\r\nWhile Scipio Æmilianus held the command in Sicily, Polybius the\r\nhistorian received a fleet from him for the purpose of proceeding on\r\na voyage of discovery in this part of the world. He relates, that\r\nbeyond[3256] Mount Atlas, proceeding in a westerly direction, there\r\nare forests filled with wild beasts, peculiar to the soil of Africa,\r\nas far as the river Anatis[3257], a distance of 485 miles, Lixos being\r\ndistant from it 205 miles. Agrippa says, that Lixos is distant from\r\nthe Straits of Gades 112 miles. After it we come to a gulf which is\r\ncalled the Gulf of Saguti[3258], a town situate on the Promontory\r\nof Mulelacha[3259], the rivers Subur and Salat[3260], and the port\r\nof Rutubis[3261], distant from Lixos 213 miles. We then come to the\r\nPromontory of the Sun[3262], the port of Risardir[3263], the Gætulian\r\nAutololes, the river Cosenus[3264], the nations of the Selatiti and\r\nthe Masati, the river Masathat[3265], and the river Darat[3266],\r\nin which crocodiles are found. After this we come to a large gulf,\r\n616[3267] miles in extent, which is enclosed by a promontory of Mount\r\nBarce[3268], which runs out in a westerly direction, and is called\r\nSurrentium[3269]. Next comes the river Salsus[3270], beyond which lie\r\nthe Æthiopian Perorsi, at the back of whom are the Pharusii[3271], who\r\nare bordered upon by the Gætulian Daræ[3272], lying in the interior.\r\nUpon the coast again, we find the Æthiopian Daratitæ, and the river\r\nBambotus[3273], teeming with crocodiles and hippopotami. From this\r\nriver there is a continuous range[3274] of mountains till we come to\r\nthe one which is known by the name of Theon Ochema[3275], from which\r\nto the Hesperian Promontory[3276] is a voyage of ten days and nights;\r\nand in the middle of this space he[3277] has placed Mount Atlas, which\r\nby all other writers has been stated to be in the extreme parts of\r\nMauritania.\r\n\r\nThe Roman arms, for the first time, pursued their conquests into\r\nMauritania, under the Emperor Claudius, when the freedman Ædemon took\r\nup arms to avenge the death of King Ptolemy[3278], who had been put\r\nto death by Caius Cæsar; and it is a well-known fact, that on the\r\nflight of the barbarians our troops reached Mount Atlas. It became\r\na boast, not only among men of consular rank, and generals selected\r\nfrom the senate, who at that time held the command, but among persons\r\nof equestrian rank as well, who after that period held the government\r\nthere, that they had penetrated as far as Mount Atlas. There are, as we\r\nhave already stated, five Roman colonies in this province; and it may\r\nvery possibly appear, if we listen only to what report says, that this\r\nmountain is easily accessible. Upon trial, however, it has been pretty\r\ngenerally shown, that all such statements are utterly fallacious; and\r\nit is too true, that men in high station, when they are disinclined\r\nto take the trouble of inquiring into the truth, through a feeling of\r\nshame at their ignorance are not averse to be guilty of falsehood; and\r\nnever is implicit credence more readily given, than when a falsehood\r\nis supported by the authority of some personage of high consideration.\r\nFor my own part, I am far less surprised that there are still some\r\nfacts remaining undiscovered by men of the equestrian order, and even\r\nthose among them who have attained senatorial rank, than that the love\r\nof luxury has left anything unascertained; the impulse of which must\r\nbe great indeed, and most powerfully felt, when the very forests are\r\nransacked for their ivory and citron-wood[3279], and all the rocks of\r\nGætulia are searched for the murex and the purple.\r\n\r\nFrom the natives, however, we learn, that on the coast, at a distance\r\nof 150 miles from the Salat, the river Asana[3280] presents itself; its\r\nwaters are salt, but it is remarkable for its fine harbour. They also\r\nsay that after this we come to a river known by the name of Fut[3281],\r\nand then, after crossing another called Vior which lies on the road, at\r\na distance of 200 miles we arrive at Dyris[3282], such being the name\r\nwhich in their language they give to Mount Atlas. According to their\r\nstory there are still existing in its vicinity many vestiges which tend\r\nto prove that the locality was once inhabited; such as the remains of\r\nvineyards and plantations of palm-trees.\r\n\r\nSuetonius Paulinus[3283], whom we have seen Consul in our own time,\r\nwas the first Roman general who advanced a distance of some miles\r\nbeyond Mount Atlas. He has given us the same information as we have\r\nreceived from other sources with reference to the extraordinary height\r\nof this mountain, and at the same time he has stated that all the\r\nlower parts about the foot of it are covered with dense and lofty\r\nforests composed of trees of species hitherto unknown. The height of\r\nthese trees, he says, is remarkable; the trunks are without knots,\r\nand of a smooth and glossy surface; the foliage is like that of the\r\ncypress, and besides sending forth a powerful odour, they are covered\r\nwith a flossy down, from which, by the aid of art, a fine cloth might\r\neasily be manufactured, similar to the textures made from the produce\r\nof the silk-worm. He informs us that the summit of this mountain is\r\ncovered with snow even in summer, and says that having arrived there\r\nafter a march of ten days, he proceeded some distance beyond it as far\r\nas a river which bears the name of Ger[3284]; the road being through\r\ndeserts covered with a black sand[3285], from which rocks that bore\r\nthe appearance of having been exposed to the action of fire, projected\r\nevery here and there; localities rendered quite uninhabitable by the\r\nintensity of the heat, as he himself experienced, although it was in\r\nthe winter season that he visited them. We also learn from the same\r\nsource that the people who inhabit the adjoining forests, which are\r\nfull of all kinds of elephants, wild beasts, and serpents, have the\r\nname of Canarii; from the circumstance that they partake of their food\r\nin common with the canine race, and share with it the entrails of wild\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact, that adjoining to these localities is a\r\nnation of Æthiopians, which bears the name of Perorsi. Juba, the\r\nfather of Ptolemy, who was the first king[3286] who reigned over\r\nboth the Mauritanias, and who has been rendered even more famous by\r\nthe brilliancy of his learning than by his kingly rank, has given us\r\nsimilar information relative to Mount Atlas, and states that a certain\r\nherb grows there, which has received the name of ‘euphorbia’[3287]\r\nfrom that of his physician, who was the first to discover it. Juba\r\nextols with wondrous praises the milky juice of this plant as tending\r\nto improve the sight, and acting as a specific against the bites of\r\nserpents and all kinds of poison; and to this subject alone he has\r\ndevoted an entire book. Thus much, if indeed not more than enough,\r\nabout Mount Atlas.\r\n\r\n(2.) The province of Tingitana is 170 miles in length[3288]. Of the\r\nnations in this province the principal one was formerly that of the\r\nMauri[3289], who have given to it the name of Mauritania, and have\r\nbeen by many writers called the Maurusii[3290]. This nation has been\r\ngreatly weakened by the disasters of war, and is now dwindled down\r\nto a few families only[3291]. Next to the Mauri was formerly the\r\nnation of the Massæsyli[3292]; they in a similar manner have become\r\nextinct. Their country is now occupied by the Gætulian nations[3293],\r\nthe Baniuræ[3294], the Autololes[3295], by far the most powerful\r\npeople among them all, and the Vesuni, who formerly were a part of\r\nthe Autololes, but have now separated from them, and, turning their\r\nsteps towards the Æthiopians[3296], have formed a distinct nation of\r\ntheir own. This province, in the mountainous district which lies on\r\nits eastern side, produces elephants, as also on the heights of Mount\r\nAbyla[3297] and among those elevations which, from the similarity of\r\ntheir height, are called the Seven Brothers[3298]. Joining the range of\r\nAbyla these mountains overlook the Straits of Gades. At the extremity\r\nof this chain begin the shores of the inland sea[3299], and we come to\r\nthe Tamuda[3300], a navigable stream, with the site of a former town of\r\nthe same name, and then the river Laud[3301], which is also navigable\r\nfor vessels, the town and port of Rhysaddir[3302], and Malvane[3303], a\r\nnavigable stream.\r\n\r\nThe city of Siga[3304], formerly the residence of King Syphax, lies\r\nopposite to that of Malaca[3305] in Spain: it now belongs to the\r\nsecond[3306] Mauritania. But these countries, I should remark, for a\r\nlong time retained the names of their respective kings, the further\r\nMauritania being called the “land of Bogud[3307],” while that which\r\nis now called Cæsariensis was called the “country of Bocchus.” After\r\npassing Siga we come to the haven called “Portus Magnus[3308]” from\r\nits great extent, with a town whose people enjoy the rights of Roman\r\ncitizens, and then the river Mulucha[3309], which served as the limit\r\nbetween the territory of Bocchus and that of the Massæsyli. Next\r\nto this is Quiza Xenitana[3310], a town founded by strangers, and\r\nArsenaria[3311], a place with the ancient Latin rights, three miles\r\ndistant from the sea. We then come to Cartenna[3312], a colony founded\r\nunder Augustus by the second legion, and Gunugum[3313], another colony\r\nfounded by the same emperor, a prætorian cohort being established\r\nthere; the Promontory of Apollo[3314], and a most celebrated city,\r\nnow called Cæsarea[3315], but formerly known by the name of Iol; this\r\nplace was the residence of King Juba, and received the rights of a\r\ncolony from the now deified Emperor Claudius. Oppidum Novum[3316] is\r\nthe next place; a colony of veterans was established here by command\r\nof the same emperor. Next to it is Tipasa[3317], which has received\r\nLatin rights, as also Icasium[3318], which has been presented by the\r\nEmperor Vespasianus with similar rights; Rusconiæ[3319], a colony\r\nfounded by Augustus; Rusucurium[3320], honoured by Claudius with\r\nthe rights of Roman citizens; Ruzacus[3321], a colony founded by\r\nAugustus; Salde[3322], another colony founded by the same emperor;\r\nIgilgili[3323], another; and the town of Tucca[3324], situate on the\r\nsea-shore and upon the river Ampsaga. In the interior are the colony\r\nof Augusta, also called Succabar[3325], Tubusuptus[3326], the cities\r\nof Timici and Tigavæ[3327], the rivers Sardabal[3328], Aves[3329], and\r\nNabar[3330], the nation of the Macurebi, the river Usar[3331], and\r\nthe nation of the Nababes. The river Ampsaga is distant from Cæsarea\r\n322[3332] miles. The length of the two Mauritanias is 1038, and their\r\nbreadth 467 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2. (3.)—NUMIDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the river Ampsaga Numidia begins, a country rendered illustrious\r\nby the fame of Masinissa. By the Greeks this region was called\r\nMetagonitis[3333]; and the Numidians received the name of “Nomades”\r\nfrom their frequent changes of pasturage; upon which occasions they\r\nwere accustomed to carry[3334] their _mapalia_, or in other words,\r\ntheir houses, upon waggons. The towns of this country are Cullu[3335]\r\nand Rusicade[3336]; and at a distance of forty-eight miles from the\r\nlatter, in the interior, is the colony of Cirta[3337], surnamed “of the\r\nSitiani;” still more inland is another colony called Sicca[3338], with\r\nthe free town of Bulla Regia[3339]. On the coast are Tacatua[3340],\r\nHippo Regius[3341], the river Armua[3342], and the town of\r\nTabraca[3343], with the rights of Roman citizens. The river Tusca[3344]\r\nforms the boundary of Numidia. This country produces nothing remarkable\r\nexcept its marble[3345] and wild beasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3. (4.)—AFRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond the river Tusca begins the region of Zeugitana[3346], and that\r\npart which properly bears the name of Africa[3347]. We here find\r\nthree promontories; the White Promontory[3348], the Promontory of\r\nApollo[3349], facing Sardinia, and that of Mercury[3350], opposite\r\nto Sicily. Projecting into the sea these headlands form two gulfs,\r\nthe first of which bears the name of “Hipponensis” from its proximity\r\nto the city called Hippo Dirutus[3351], a corruption of the Greek\r\nname Diarrhytus, which it has received from the channels made for\r\nirrigation. Adjacent to this place, but at a greater distance from\r\nthe sea-shore, is Theudalis[3352], a town exempt from tribute. We\r\nthen come to the Promontory of Apollo, and upon the second gulf, we\r\nfind Utica[3353], a place enjoying the rights of Roman citizens, and\r\nfamous for the death of Cato; the river Bagrada[3354], the place called\r\nCastra Cornelia[3355], the colony[3356] of Carthage, founded upon\r\nthe remains of Great Carthage[3357], the colony of Maxula[3358], the\r\ntowns of Carpi[3359], Misua, and Clypea[3360], the last a free town,\r\non the Promontory of Mercury; also Curubis, a free town[3361], and\r\nNeapolis[3362].\r\n\r\nHere commences the second division[3363] of Africa properly so called.\r\nThose who inhabit Byzacium have the name of Libyphœnices[3364].\r\nByzacium is the name of a district which is 250 miles in circumference,\r\nand is remarkable for its extreme fertility, as the ground returns the\r\nseed sown by the husbandman with interest a hundred-fold[3365]. Here\r\nare the free towns of Leptis[3366], Adrumetum[3367], Ruspina[3368],\r\nand Thapsus[3369]; and then Thenæ[3370], Macomades[3371], Tacape[3372],\r\nand Sabrata[3373] which touches on the Lesser Syrtis; to which spot,\r\nfrom the Ampsaga, the length of Numidia and Africa is 580 miles, and\r\nthe breadth, so far as it has been ascertained, 200. That portion\r\nwhich we have called Africa is divided into two provinces, the Old and\r\nthe New; these are separated by a dyke which was made by order of the\r\nsecond Scipio Africanus[3374] and the kings[3375], and extended to\r\nThenæ, which town is distant from Carthage 216 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4.—THE SYRTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA third Gulf is divided into two smaller ones, those of the two\r\nSyrtes[3376], which are rendered perilous by the shallows of their\r\nquicksands and the ebb and flow of the sea. Polybius states the\r\ndistance from Carthage to the Lesser Syrtis, the one which is nearest\r\nto it, to be 300 miles. The inlet to it he also states to be 100\r\nmiles across, and its circumference 300. There is also a way[3377] to\r\nit by land, to find which we must employ the guidance of the stars\r\nand cross deserts which present nothing but sand and serpents. After\r\npassing these we come to forests filled with vast multitudes of wild\r\nbeasts and elephants, then desert wastes[3378], and beyond them the\r\nGaramantes[3379], distant twelve days’ journey from the Augylæ[3380].\r\nAbove the Garamantes was formerly the nation of the Psylli[3381], and\r\nabove them again the Lake of Lycomedes[3382], surrounded with deserts.\r\nThe Augylæ themselves are situate almost midway between Æthiopia which\r\nfaces the west[3383], and the region which lies between[3384] the two\r\nSyrtes, at an equal distance from both. The distance along the coast\r\nthat lies between the two Syrtes is 250 miles. On it are found the city\r\nof Œa[3385], the river Cinyps[3386], and the country of that name, the\r\ntowns of Neapolis[3387], Graphara[3388], and Abrotonum[3389], and the\r\nsecond, surnamed the Greater, Leptis[3390].\r\n\r\nWe next come to the Greater Syrtis, 625 miles in circumference, and at\r\nthe entrance 312 miles in width; next after which dwells the nation\r\nof the Cisippades. At the bottom of this gulf was the coast of the\r\nLotophagi, whom some writers have called the Alachroæ[3391], extending\r\nas far as the Altars of the Philæni[3392]; these Altars are formed\r\nof heaps of sand. On passing these, not far from the shore there is\r\na vast swamp[3393] which receives the river Triton[3394] and from it\r\ntakes its name: by Callimachus it is called Pallantias[3395], and is\r\nsaid by him to be on the nearer side of the Lesser Syrtis; many other\r\nwriters however place it between the two Syrtes. The promontory which\r\nbounds the Greater Syrtis has the name of Borion[3396]; beyond it is\r\nthe province of Cyrene.\r\n\r\nAfrica, from the river Ampsaga to this limit, includes 516 peoples, who\r\nare subject to the Roman sway, of which six are colonies; among them\r\nUthina[3397] and Tuburbi[3398], besides those already mentioned. The\r\ntowns enjoying the rights of Roman citizens are fifteen in number, of\r\nwhich I shall mention, as lying in the interior, those of Assuræ[3399],\r\nAbutucum, Aborium, Canopicum[3400], Cilma[3401], Simithium,\r\nThunusidium, Tuburnicum, Tynidrumum, Tibiga, the two towns called\r\nUcita, the Greater and the Lesser, and Vaga. There is also one town\r\nwith Latin rights, Uzalita by name, and one town of tributaries, Castra\r\nCornelia[3402]. The free towns are thirty in number, among which we\r\nmay mention, in the interior, those of Acholla[3403], Aggarita, Avina,\r\nAbzirita, Canopita, Melizita, Matera, Salaphita, Tusdrita[3404],\r\nTiphica, Tunica[3405], Theuda, Tagasta[3406], Tiga[3407], Ulusubrita,\r\na second Vaga, Visa, and Zama[3408]. Of the remaining number, most of\r\nthem should be called, in strictness, not only cities, but nations\r\neven; such for instance as the Natabudes, the Capsitani[3409],\r\nthe Musulami, the Sabarbares, the Massyli[3410], the Nisives, the\r\nVamacures, the Cinithi, the Musuni, the Marchubii[3411], and the whole\r\nof Gætulia[3412], as far as the river Nigris[3413], which separates\r\nAfrica proper from Æthiopia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (5.)—CYRENAICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe region of Cyrenaica, also called Pentapolis[3414], is rendered\r\nfamous by the oracle of Hammon[3415], which is distant 400 miles\r\nfrom the city of Cyrene; also by the Fountain of the Sun[3416]\r\nthere, and five cities in especial, those of Berenice[3417],\r\nArsinoë[3418], Ptolemais[3419], Apollonia[3420], and Cyrene[3421]\r\nitself. Berenice is situate upon the outer promontory that bounds the\r\nSyrtis; it was formerly called the city of the Hesperides (previously\r\nmentioned[3422]), according to the fables of the Greeks, which very\r\noften change their localities. Not far from the city, and running\r\nbefore it, is the river Lethon, and with it a sacred grove, where\r\nthe gardens of the Hesperides are said to have formerly stood; this\r\ncity is distant from Leptis 375 miles. From Berenice to Arsinoë,\r\ncommonly called Teuchira, is forty-three miles; after which, at a\r\ndistance of twenty-two, we come to Ptolemais, the ancient name of\r\nwhich was Barce; and at a distance of forty miles from this last the\r\nPromontory of Phycus[3423], which extends far away into the Cretan\r\nSea, being 350 miles distant from Tænarum[3424], the promontory of\r\nLaconia, and from Crete 225. After passing this promontory we come to\r\nCyrene, which stands at a distance of eleven miles from the sea. From\r\nPhycus to Apollonia[3425] is twenty-four miles, and from thence to\r\nthe Chersonesus[3426] eighty-eight; from which to Catabathmos[3427]\r\nis a distance of 216 miles. The Marmaridæ[3428] inhabit this coast,\r\nextending from almost the region of Parætonium[3429] to the Greater\r\nSyrtis; after them the Ararauceles, and then, upon the coasts of\r\nthe Syrtis, the Nasamones[3430], whom the Greeks formerly called\r\nMesammones, from the circumstance of their being located in the very\r\nmidst of sands[3431]. The territory of Cyrene, to a distance of fifteen\r\nmiles from the shore, is said to abound in trees, while for the same\r\ndistance beyond that district it is only suitable for the cultivation\r\nof corn: after which, a tract of land, thirty miles in breadth and 250\r\nin length, is productive of nothing but laser [or silphium[3432]].\r\n\r\nAfter the Nasamones we come to the dwellings of the Asbystæ and the\r\nMacæ[3433], and beyond them, at eleven days’ journey to the west of the\r\nGreater Syrtis, the Amantes[3434], a people also surrounded by sands\r\nin every direction. They find water however without any difficulty at\r\na depth mostly of about two cubits, as their district receives the\r\noverflow of the waters of Mauritania. They build houses with blocks of\r\nsalt[3435], which they cut out of their mountains just as we do stone.\r\nFrom this nation to the Troglodytæ[3436] the distance is seven days’\r\njourney in a south-westerly direction, a people with whom our only\r\nintercourse is for the purpose of procuring from them the precious\r\nstone which we call the carbuncle, and which is brought from the\r\ninterior of Æthiopia. Upon the road to this last people, but turning\r\noff towards the deserts of Africa, of which we have previously[3437]\r\nmade mention as lying beyond the Lesser Syrtis, is the region of\r\nPhazania[3438]; the nation of Phazanii, belonging to which, as well\r\nas the cities of Alele[3439] and Cilliba[3440], we have subdued by\r\nforce of arms, as also Cydamus[3441], which lies over against Sabrata.\r\nAfter passing these places a range of mountains extends in a prolonged\r\nchain from east to west: these have received from our people the name\r\nof the Black Mountains[3442], either from the appearance which they\r\nnaturally bear of having been exposed to the action of fire, or else\r\nfrom the fact that they have been scorched by the reflection of the\r\nsun’s rays. Beyond it[3443] is the desert, and then Talgæ, a city of\r\nthe Garamantes, and Debris, at which place there is a spring[3444],\r\nthe waters of which, from noon to midnight, are at boiling heat, and\r\nthen freeze for as many hours until the following noon; Garama too,\r\nthat most famous capital of the Garamantes; all which places have been\r\nsubdued by the Roman arms. It was on this occasion that Cornelius\r\nBalbus[3445] was honoured with a triumph, the only foreigner indeed\r\nthat was ever honoured with the triumphal chariot, and presented\r\nwith the rights of a Roman citizen; for, although by birth a native\r\nof Gades, the Roman citizenship was granted to him as well as to the\r\nelder Balbus[3446], his uncle by the father’s side. There is also this\r\nremarkable circumstance, that our writers have handed down to us the\r\nnames of the cities above-mentioned as having been taken by Balbus, and\r\nhave informed us that on the occasion of his triumph[3447], besides\r\nCydamus and Garama[3448], there were carried in the procession the\r\nnames and models of all the other nations and cities, in the following\r\norder: the town of Tabudium[3449], the nation of Niteris, the town\r\nof Nigligemella, the nation or town of Bubeium[3450], the nation of\r\nEnipi, the town of Thuben, the mountain known as the Black Mountain,\r\nNitibrum, the towns called Rapsa, the nation of Discera[3451], the town\r\nof Debris[3452], the river Nathabur[3453], the town of Thapsagum[3454],\r\nthe nation of Nannagi, the town of Boin, the town of Pege[3455],\r\nthe river Dasibari; and then the towns, in the following order, of\r\nBaracum, Buluba, Alasit, Galia, Balla, Maxalla[3456], Zizama, and Mount\r\nGyri[3457], which was preceded by an inscription stating that this was\r\nthe place where precious stones were produced.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time it has been found impracticable to keep open\r\nthe road that leads to the country of the Garamantes, as the predatory\r\nbands of that nation have filled up the wells with sand, which do not\r\nrequire to be dug for to any great depth, if you only have a knowledge\r\nof the locality. In the late war[3458] however, which, at the beginning\r\nof the reign of the Emperor Vespasian, the Romans carried on with the\r\npeople of Œa, a short cut of only four days’ journey was discovered;\r\nthis road is known as the “Præter Caput Saxi[3459].” The last place in\r\nthe territory of Cyrenaica is Catabathmos, consisting of a town, and a\r\nvalley with a sudden and steep descent. The length of Cyrenean Africa,\r\nup to this boundary from the Lesser Syrtis, is 1060 miles; and, so far\r\nas has been ascertained, it is 800[3460] in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6. (6.)—LIBYA MAREOTIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe region that follows is called Libya Mareotis[3461], and borders\r\nupon Egypt. It is held by the Marmaridæ, the Adyrmachidæ, and, after\r\nthem, the Mareotæ. The distance from Catabathmos to Parætonium is\r\neighty-six miles. In this district is Apis[3462], a place rendered\r\nfamous by the religious belief of Egypt. From this town Parætonium is\r\ndistant sixty-two miles, and from thence to Alexandria the distance is\r\n200 miles, the breadth of the district being 169. Eratosthenes says\r\nthat it is 525 miles by land from Cyrene to Alexandria; while Agrippa\r\ngives the length of the whole of Africa from the Atlantic Sea, and\r\nincluding Lower Egypt, as 3040 miles. Polybius and Eratosthenes, who\r\nare generally considered as remarkable for their extreme correctness,\r\nstate the length to be, from the ocean to Great Carthage 1100 miles,\r\nand from Carthage to Canopus, the nearest mouth of the Nile, 1628\r\nmiles; while Isidorus speaks of the distance from Tingi to Canopus as\r\nbeing 3599 miles. Artemidorus makes this last distance forty miles less\r\nthan Isidorus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7. (7.)—THE ISLANDS IN THE VICINITY OF AFRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese seas contain not so very many islands. The most famous among\r\nthem is Meninx[3463], twenty-five miles in length and twenty-two in\r\nbreadth: by Eratosthenes it is called Lotophagitis. This island has\r\ntwo towns, Meninx on the side which faces Africa, and Troas on the\r\nother; it is situate off the promontory which lies on the right-hand\r\nside of the Lesser Syrtis, at a distance of a mile and a half. One\r\nhundred miles from this island, and opposite the promontory that lies\r\non the left, is the free island of Cercina[3464], with a city of the\r\nsame name. It is twenty-five miles long, and half that breadth at the\r\nplace where it is the widest, but not more than five miles across at\r\nthe extremity: the diminutive island of Cercinitis[3465], which looks\r\ntowards Carthage, is united to it by a bridge. At a distance of nearly\r\nfifty miles from these is the island of Lopadusa[3466], six miles in\r\nlength; and beyond it Gaulos and Galata, the soil of which kills the\r\nscorpion, that noxious reptile of Africa. It is also said that the\r\nscorpion will not live at Clypea; opposite to which place lies the\r\nisland of Cosyra[3467], with a town of the same name. Opposite to the\r\nGulf of Carthage are the two islands known as the Ægimuri[3468]; the\r\nAltars[3469], which are rather rocks than islands, lie more between\r\nSicily and Sardinia. There are some authors who state that these rocks\r\nwere once inhabited, but that they have gradually subsided in the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8. (8.)—COUNTRIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF AFRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we pass through the interior of Africa in a southerly direction,\r\nbeyond the Gætuli, after having traversed the intervening deserts,\r\nwe shall find, first of all the Liby-Egyptians[3470], and then\r\nthe country where the Leucæthiopians[3471] dwell. Beyond[3472]\r\nthese are the Nigritæ[3473], nations of Æthiopia, so called from\r\nthe river Nigris[3474], which has been previously mentioned, the\r\nGymnetes[3475], surnamed Pharusii, and, on the very margin of the\r\nocean, the Perorsi[3476], whom we have already spoken of as lying on\r\nthe boundaries of Mauritania. After passing all these peoples, there\r\nare vast deserts towards the east until we come to the Garamantes, the\r\nAugylæ, and the Troglodytæ; the opinion of those being exceedingly\r\nwell founded who place two Æthiopias beyond the deserts of Africa, and\r\nmore particularly that expressed by Homer[3477], who tells us that the\r\nÆthiopians are divided into two nations, those of the east and those of\r\nthe west. The river Nigris has the same characteristics as the Nile;\r\nit produces the calamus, the papyrus, and just the same animals, and\r\nit rises at the same seasons of the year. Its source is between the\r\nTarrælian Æthiopians and the Œcalicæ. Magium, the city of the latter\r\npeople, has been placed by some writers amid the deserts, and, next\r\nto them the Atlantes; then the Ægipani, half men, half beasts, the\r\nBlemmyæ[3478], the Gamphasantes, the Satyri, and the Himantopodes.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantes[3479], if we believe what is said, have lost all\r\ncharacteristics of humanity; for there is no mode of distinguishing\r\neach other among them by names, and as they look upon the rising and\r\nthe setting sun, they give utterance to direful imprecations against\r\nit, as being deadly to themselves and their lands; nor are they\r\nvisited with dreams[3480], like the rest of mortals. The Troglodytæ\r\nmake excavations in the earth, which serve them for dwellings; the\r\nflesh of serpents is their food; they have no articulate voice, but\r\nonly utter a kind of squeaking noise[3481]; and thus are they utterly\r\ndestitute of all means of communication by language. The Garamantes\r\nhave no institution of marriage among them, and live in promiscuous\r\nconcubinage with their women. The Augylæ worship no deities[3482] but\r\nthe gods of the infernal regions. The Gamphasantes, who go naked, and\r\nare unacquainted with war[3483], hold no intercourse whatever with\r\nstrangers. The Blemmyæ are said to have no heads, their mouths and\r\neyes being seated in their breasts. The Satyri[3484], beyond their\r\nfigure, have nothing in common with the manners of the human race,\r\nand the form of the Ægipani[3485] is such as is commonly represented\r\nin paintings. The Himantopodes[3486] are a race of people with feet\r\nresembling thongs, upon which they move along by nature with a\r\nserpentine, crawling kind of gait. The Pharusii, descended from the\r\nancient Persians, are said to have been the companions of Hercules when\r\non his expedition to the Hesperides. Beyond the above, I have met with\r\nnothing relative to Africa[3487] worthy of mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9. (9.)—EGYPT AND THEBAIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoining on to Africa is Asia, the extent of which, according to\r\nTimosthenes, from the Canopic mouth of the Nile to the mouth of the\r\nEuxine, is 2639 miles. From the mouth of the Euxine to that of Lake\r\nMæotis is, according to Eratosthenes, 1545 miles. The whole distance to\r\nthe Tanais, including Egypt, is, according to Artemidorus and Isidorus,\r\n6375[3488] miles. The seas of Egypt, which are several in number, have\r\nreceived their names from those who dwell upon their shores, for which\r\nreason they will be mentioned together.\r\n\r\nEgypt is the country which lies next to Africa; in the interior it runs\r\nin a southerly direction, as far as the territory of the Æthiopians,\r\nwho lie extended at the back of it. The river Nile, dividing itself,\r\nforms on the right and left the boundary of its lower part, which it\r\nembraces on every side[3489]. By the Canopic mouth of that river it is\r\nseparated from Africa, and by the Pelusiac from Asia, there being a\r\ndistance between the two of 170 miles. For this reason it is that some\r\npersons have reckoned Egypt among the islands, the Nile so dividing\r\nitself as to give a triangular form to the land which it encloses: from\r\nwhich circumstance also many persons have named Egypt the Delta[3490],\r\nafter that of the Greek letter so called. The distance from the spot\r\nwhere the channel of the river first divides into branches, to the\r\nCanopic mouth, is 146 miles, and to the Pelusiac, 166.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of Egypt, which borders on Æthiopia, is known as\r\nThebais. This district is divided into prefectures of towns, which\r\nare generally designated as “Nomes.” These are Ombites[3491],\r\nApollopolites[3492], Hermonthites[3493], Thinites[3494],\r\nPhaturites[3495], Coptites[3496], Tentyrites[3497], Diopolites[3498],\r\nAntæopolites[3499], Aphroditopolites[3500], and Lycopolites[3501]. The\r\ndistrict which lies in the vicinity of Pelusium contains the following\r\nNomes, Pharbæthites, Bubastites[3502], Sethroites, and Tanites[3503].\r\nThe remaining Nomes are those called the Arabian; the Hammonian,\r\nwhich lies on the road to the oracle of Jupiter Hammon; and those\r\nknown by the names of Oxyrynchites, Leontopolites, Athribites[3504],\r\nCynopolites[3505], Hermopolites[3506], Xoites, Mendesium,\r\nSebennytes[3507], Cabasites, Latopolites, Heliopolites, Prosopites,\r\nPanopolites, Busirites[3508], Onuphites[3509], Saïtes[3510], Ptenethu,\r\nPhthemphu[3511], Naucratites[3512], Metelites, Gynæcopolites,\r\nMenelaites,—all in the region of Alexandria, besides Mareotis in Libya.\r\n\r\nHeracleopolites[3513] is a Nome on an island[3513] of the Nile,\r\nfifty miles in length, upon which there is a city, called the ‘City\r\nof Hercules.’ There are two places called Arsinoïtes[3514]: these\r\nand Memphites[3515] extend to the apex[3516] of the Delta; adjoining\r\nto which, on the side of Africa, are the two Nomes of Oasites[3517].\r\nSome writers vary in some of these names and substitute for them other\r\nNomes, such as Heroöpolites[3518] and Crocodilopolites[3519]. Between\r\nArsinoïtes and Memphites, a lake[3520], 250 miles, or, according to\r\nwhat Mucianus says, 450 miles in circumference and fifty paces deep,\r\nhas been formed by artificial means: after the king by whose orders it\r\nwas made, it is called by the name of Mœris. The distance from thence\r\nto Memphis is nearly sixty-two miles, a place which was formerly the\r\ncitadel of the kings of Egypt; from thence to the oracle of Hammon\r\nit is twelve days’ journey. Memphis is fifteen miles from the spot\r\nwhere the river Nile divides into the different channels which we have\r\nmentioned as forming the Delta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10.—THE RIVER NILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sources of the Nile[3521] are unascertained, and, travelling as\r\nit does for an immense distance through deserts and burning sands, it\r\nis only known to us by common report, having neither experienced the\r\nvicissitudes of warfare, nor been visited by those arms which have\r\nso effectually explored all other regions. It rises, so far indeed\r\nas King Juba was enabled to ascertain, in a mountain[3522] of Lower\r\nMauritania, not far from the ocean; immediately after which it forms\r\na lake of standing water, which bears the name of Nilides[3523]. In\r\nthis lake are found the several kinds of fish known by the names of\r\nalabeta[3524], coracinus, and silurus; a crocodile also was brought\r\nthence as a proof that this really is the Nile, and was consecrated\r\nby Juba himself in the temple of Isis at Cæsarea[3525], where it may\r\nbe seen at the present day. In addition to these facts, it has been\r\nobserved that the waters of the Nile rise in the same proportion in\r\nwhich the snows and rains of Mauritania increase. Pouring forth from\r\nthis lake, the river disdains to flow through arid and sandy deserts,\r\nand for a distance of several days’ journey conceals itself; after\r\nwhich it bursts forth at another lake of greater magnitude in the\r\ncountry of the Massæsyli[3526], a people of Mauritania Cæsariensis,\r\nand thence casts a glance around, as it were, upon the communities\r\nof men in its vicinity, giving proofs of its identity in the same\r\npeculiarities of the animals which it produces. It then buries itself\r\nonce again in the sands of the desert, and remains concealed for a\r\ndistance of twenty days’ journey, till it has reached the confines of\r\nÆthiopia. Here, when it has once more become sensible of the presence\r\nof man, it again emerges, at the same source, in all probability, to\r\nwhich writers have given the name of Niger, or Black. After this,\r\nforming the boundary-line between Africa and Æthiopia, its banks,\r\nthough not immediately peopled by man, are the resort of numbers of\r\nwild beasts and animals of various kinds. Giving birth in its course\r\nto dense forests of trees, it travels through the middle of Æthiopia,\r\nunder the name of Astapus, a word which signifies, in the language of\r\nthe nations who dwell in those regions, “water issuing from the shades\r\nbelow.” Proceeding onwards, it divides[3527] innumerable islands in\r\nits course, and some of them of such vast magnitude, that although its\r\ntide runs with the greatest rapidity, it is not less than five days\r\nin passing them. When making the circuit of Meroë, the most famous of\r\nthese islands, the left branch of the river is called Astobores[3528],\r\nor, in other words, “an arm of the water that issues from the shades,”\r\nwhile the right arm has the name of Astosapes[3529], which adds to its\r\noriginal signification the meaning of “side[3530].” It does not obtain\r\nthe name of “Nile” until its waters have again met and are united in a\r\nsingle stream; and even then, for some miles both above and below the\r\npoint of confluence, it has the name of Siris. Homer has given to the\r\nwhole of this river the name of Ægyptus, while other writers again have\r\ncalled it Triton[3531]. Every now and then its course is interrupted by\r\nislands which intervene, and which only serve as so many incentives to\r\nadd to the impetuosity of its torrent; and though at last it is hemmed\r\nin by mountains on either side, in no part is the tide more rapid and\r\nprecipitate. Its waters then hastening onwards, it is borne along to\r\nthe spot in the country of the Æthiopians which is known by the name of\r\n“Catadupi[3532];” where, at the last Cataract[3533], the complaint is,\r\nnot that it flows, but that it rushes, with an immense noise between\r\nthe rocks that lie in its way: after which it becomes more smooth,\r\nthe violence of its waters is broken and subdued, and, wearied out as\r\nit were by the length of the distance it has travelled, it discharges\r\nitself, though by many mouths[3534], into the Egyptian sea. During\r\ncertain days of the year, however, the volume of its waters is greatly\r\nincreased, and as it traverses the whole of Egypt, it inundates the\r\nearth, and, by so doing, greatly promotes its fertility.\r\n\r\nThere have been various reasons suggested for this increase of the\r\nriver. Of these, however, the most probable are, either that its\r\nwaters are driven back by the Etesian winds[3535], which are blowing\r\nat this season of the year from an opposite direction, and that the\r\nsea which lies beyond is driven into the mouths of the river; or else\r\nthat its waters are swollen by the summer rains of Æthiopia[3536],\r\nwhich fall from the clouds conveyed thither by the Etesian winds from\r\nother parts of the earth. Timæus the mathematician has alleged a reason\r\nof an occult nature: he says that the source of the river is known\r\nby the name of Phiala, and that the stream buries itself in channels\r\nunderground, where it sends forth vapours generated by the heat among\r\nthe steaming rocks amid which it conceals itself; but that, during the\r\ndays of the inundation, in consequence of the sun approaching nearer\r\nto the earth, the waters are drawn forth by the influence of his heat,\r\nand on being thus exposed to the air, overflow; after which, in order\r\nthat it may not be utterly dried up, the stream hides itself once more.\r\nHe says that this takes place at the rising of the Dog-Star, when the\r\nsun enters the sign of Leo, and stands in a vertical position over the\r\nsource of the river, at which time at that spot there is no shadow\r\nthrown. Most authors, however, are of opinion, on the contrary, that\r\nthe river flows in greater volume when the sun takes his departure for\r\nthe north, which he does when he enters the signs of Cancer and Leo,\r\nbecause its waters then are not dried up to so great an extent; while\r\non the other hand, when he returns towards the south pole and re-enters\r\nCapricorn, its waters are absorbed by the heat, and consequently flow\r\nin less abundance. If there is any one inclined to be of opinion, with\r\nTimæus, that the waters of the river may be drawn out of the earth by\r\nthe heat, it will be as well for him to bear in mind the fact, that the\r\nabsence of shadow is a phænomenon which lasts continuously[3537] in\r\nthese regions.\r\n\r\nThe Nile begins to increase at the next new moon after the summer\r\nsolstice, and rises slowly and gradually as the sun passes through the\r\nsign of Cancer; it is at its greatest height while the sun is passing\r\nthrough Leo, and it falls as slowly and gradually as it arose while he\r\nis passing through the sign of Virgo. It has totally subsided between\r\nits banks, as we learn from Herodotus, on the hundredth day, when\r\nthe sun has entered Libra. While it is rising it has been pronounced\r\ncriminal for kings or prefects even to sail upon its waters. The\r\nmeasure of its increase is ascertained by means of wells[3538]. Its\r\nmost desirable height is sixteen cubits[3539]; if the waters do not\r\nattain that height, the overflow is not universal; but if they exceed\r\nthat measure, by their slowness in receding they tend to retard the\r\nprocess of cultivation. In the latter case the time for sowing is lost,\r\nin consequence of the moisture of the soil; in the former, the ground\r\nis so parched that the seed-time comes to no purpose. The country has\r\nreason to make careful note of either extreme. When the water rises\r\nto only twelve cubits, it experiences the horrors of famine; when\r\nit attains thirteen, hunger is still the result; a rise of fourteen\r\ncubits is productive of gladness; a rise of fifteen sets all anxieties\r\nat rest; while an increase of sixteen is productive of unbounded\r\ntransports of joy. The greatest increase known, up to the present time,\r\nis that of eighteen cubits, which took place in the time of the Emperor\r\nClaudius; the smallest rise was that of five, in the year of the battle\r\nof Pharsalia[3540], the river by this prodigy testifying its horror, as\r\nit were, at the murder of Pompeius Magnus. When the waters have reached\r\ntheir greatest height, the people open the embankments and admit them\r\nto the lands. As each district is left by the waters, the business of\r\nsowing commences. This is the only river in existence that emits no\r\nvapours[3541].\r\n\r\nThe Nile first enters the Egyptian territory at Syene[3542], on\r\nthe frontiers of Æthiopia; that is the name of a peninsula a mile\r\nin circumference, upon which Castra[3543] is situate, on the side\r\nof Arabia. Opposite to it are the four islands of Philæ[3544], at a\r\ndistance of 600 miles from the place where the Nile divides into two\r\nchannels; at which spot, as we have already stated, the Delta, as\r\nit is called, begins. This, at least, is the distance, according to\r\nArtemidorus, who also informs us that there were in it 250 towns; Juba\r\nsays, however, that the distance between these places is 400 miles.\r\nAristocreon says that the distance from Elephantis to the sea is 750\r\nmiles; Elephantis[3545] being an inhabited island four miles below the\r\nlast Cataract, sixteen[3546] beyond Syene, 585 from Alexandria, and the\r\nextreme limit of the navigation of Egypt. To such an extent as this\r\nhave the above-named authors[3547] been mistaken! This island is the\r\nplace of rendezvous for the vessels of the Æthiopians; they are made to\r\nfold up[3548], and the people carry them on their shoulders whenever\r\nthey come to the Cataracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11.—THE CITIES OF EGYPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEgypt, besides its boast of extreme antiquity, asserts that it\r\ncontained, in the reign of King Amasis[3549], 20,000 inhabited\r\ncities: in our day they are still very numerous, though no longer\r\nof any particular note. Still however we find the following ones\r\nmentioned as of great renown—the city of Apollo[3550]; next, that\r\nof Leucothea[3551]; then Great Diospolis[3552], otherwise Thebes,\r\nknown to fame for its hundred gates; Coptos[3553], which from its\r\nproximity to the Nile, forms its nearest emporium for the merchandise\r\nof India and Arabia; then the town of Venus[3554], and then another\r\ntown of Jupiter[3555]. After this comes Tentyris[3556], below which\r\nis Abydus[3557], the royal abode of Memnon, and famous for a temple\r\nof Osiris[3558], which is situate in Libya[3559], at a distance from\r\nthe river of seven miles and a half. Next to it comes Ptolemais[3560],\r\nthen Panopolis[3561], and then another town of Venus[3562], and, on\r\nthe Libyan side, Lycon[3563], where the mountains form the boundary\r\nof the province of Thebais. On passing these, we come to the towns of\r\nMercury[3564], Alabastron[3565], the town of Dogs[3566], and that of\r\nHercules already mentioned[3567]. We next come to Arsinoë[3568], and\r\nMemphis[3569], which has been previously mentioned; between which last\r\nand the Nome of Arsinoïtes, upon the Libyan side, are the towers known\r\nas the Pyramids, the Labyrinth[3570] on Lake Mœris, in the construction\r\nof which no wood was employed, and the town of Crialon[3571]. Besides\r\nthese, there is one place in the interior, on the confines of Arabia,\r\nof great celebrity, the City of the Sun[3572].\r\n\r\n(10.) With the greatest justice, however, we may lavish our praises\r\nupon Alexandria, built by Alexander the Great on the shores of the\r\nEgyptian Sea, upon the soil of Africa, at twelve miles’ distance\r\nfrom the Canopic Mouth and near Lake Mareotis[3573]; the spot having\r\npreviously borne the name of Rhacotes. The plan of this city was\r\ndesigned by the architect Dinochares[3574], who is memorable for the\r\ngenius which he displayed in many ways. Building the city upon a wide\r\nspace[3575] of ground fifteen miles in circumference, he formed it in\r\nthe circular shape of a Macedonian chlamys[3576], uneven at the edge,\r\ngiving it an angular projection on the right and left; while at the\r\nsame time he devoted one-fifth part of the site to the royal palace.\r\n\r\nLake Mareotis, which lies on the south side of the city, is connected\r\nby a canal which joins it to the Canopic mouth, and serves for the\r\npurposes of communication with the interior. It has also a great number\r\nof islands, and is thirty miles across, and 150 in circumference,\r\naccording to Claudius Cæsar. Other writers say that it is forty schœni\r\nin length, making the schœnum to be thirty stadia; hence, according to\r\nthem, it is 150 miles[3577] in length and the same in breadth.\r\n\r\nThere are also, in the latter part of the course of the Nile, many\r\ntowns of considerable celebrity, and more especially those which have\r\ngiven their names to the mouths of the river—I do not mean, all the\r\nmouths, for there are no less than twelve of them, as well as four\r\nothers, which the people call the False Mouths[3578]. I allude to the\r\nseven more famous ones, the Canopic[3579] Mouth, next to Alexandria,\r\nthose of Bolbitine[3580], Sebennys[3581], Phatnis[3582], Mendes[3583],\r\nTanis[3584], and, last of all, Pelusium[3585]. Besides the above there\r\nare the towns of Butos[3586], Pharbæthos[3587], Leontopolis[3588],\r\nAthribis[3589], the town of Isis[3590], Busiris[3591], Cynopolis[3592],\r\nAphrodites[3593], Sais[3594], and Naucratis[3595], from which last some\r\nwriters call that the Naucratitic Mouth, which is by others called the\r\nHeracleotic, and mention it instead[3596] of the Canopic Mouth, which\r\nis the next to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (11.)—THE COASTS OF ARABIA, SITUATE ON THE EGYPTIAN SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond the Pelusiac Mouth is Arabia[3597], which extends to the Red\r\nSea, and joins the Arabia known by the surname of Happy[3598], so\r\nfamous for its perfumes and its wealth. This[3599] is called Arabia of\r\nthe Catabanes[3600], the Esbonitæ[3601], and the Scenitæ[3602]; it is\r\nremarkable for its sterility, except in the parts where it joins up to\r\nSyria, and it has nothing remarkable in it except Mount Casius[3603].\r\nThe Arabian nations of the Canchlæi[3604] join these on the east, and,\r\non the south the Cedrei[3605], both of which peoples are adjoining\r\nto the Nabatæi[3606]. The two gulfs of the Red Sea, where it borders\r\nupon Egypt, are called the Heroöpolitic[3607] and the Ælanitic[3608].\r\nBetween the two towns of Ælana[3609] and Gaza[3610] upon our sea[3611],\r\nthere is a distance of 150 miles. Agrippa says that Arsinoë[3612], a\r\ntown on the Red Sea, is, by way of the desert, 125 miles from Pelusium.\r\nHow different the characteristics impressed by nature upon two places\r\nseparated by so small a distance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13. (12.)—SYRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to these countries Syria occupies the coast, once the greatest of\r\nlands, and distinguished by many names; for the part which joins up to\r\nArabia was formerly called Palæstina, Judæa, Cœle[3613], and Phœnice.\r\nThe country in the interior was called Damascena, and that further\r\non and more to the south, Babylonia. The part that lies between the\r\nEuphrates and the Tigris was called Mesopotamia, that beyond Taurus\r\nSophene, and that on this side of the same chain Comagene. Beyond\r\nArmenia was the country of Adiabene, anciently called Assyria, and\r\nat the part where it joins up to Cilicia, it was called Antiochia.\r\nIts length, between Cilicia and Arabia[3614], is 470 miles, and its\r\nbreadth, from Seleucia Pieria[3615] to Zeugma[3616], a town on the\r\nEuphrates, 175. Those who make a still more minute division of this\r\ncountry will have it that Phœnice is surrounded by Syria, and that\r\nfirst comes the maritime coast of Syria, part of which is Idumæa and\r\nJudæa, after that Phœnice, and then Syria. The whole of the tract of\r\nsea that lies in front of these shores is called the Phœnician Sea.\r\nThe Phœnician people enjoy the glory of having been the inventors of\r\nletters[3617], and the first discoverers of the sciences of astronomy,\r\nnavigation, and the art of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14.—IDUMÆA, PALÆSTINA, AND SAMARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving Pelusium we come to the Camp of Chabrias[3618], Mount\r\nCasius[3619], the temple of Jupiter Casius, and the tomb of Pompeius\r\nMagnus. Ostracine[3620], at a distance of sixty-five miles from\r\nPelusium, is the frontier town of Arabia.\r\n\r\n(13.) After this, at the point where the Sirbonian Lake[3621] becomes\r\nvisible, Idumæa and Palæstina begin. This lake, which some writers\r\nhave made to be 150 miles in circumference, Herodotus has placed at\r\nthe foot of Mount Casius; it is now an inconsiderable fen. The towns\r\nare Rhinocolura[3622], and, in the interior, Rhaphea[3623], Gaza, and,\r\nstill more inland, Anthedon[3624]: there is also Mount Argaris[3625].\r\nProceeding along the coast we come to the region of Samaria;\r\nAscalo[3626], a free town, Azotus[3627], the two Jamniæ[3628], one\r\nof them in the interior; and Joppe[3629], a city of the Phœnicians,\r\nwhich existed, it is said, before the deluge of the earth. It is\r\nsituate on the slope of a hill, and in front of it lies a rock, upon\r\nwhich they point out the vestiges of the chains by which Andromeda\r\nwas bound[3630]. Here the fabulous goddess Ceto[3631] is worshipped.\r\nNext to this place comes Apollonia[3632], and then the Tower of\r\nStrato[3633], otherwise Cæsarea, built by King Herod, but now the\r\nColony of Prima Flavia, established by the Emperor Vespasianus: this\r\nplace is the frontier town of Palæstina, at a distance of 188 miles\r\nfrom the confines of Arabia; after which comes Phœnice[3634]. In the\r\ninterior of Samaria are the towns of Neapolis[3635], formerly called\r\nMamortha, Sebaste[3636], situate on a mountain, and, on a still more\r\nlofty one, Gamala[3637].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15. (14.)—JUDÆA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond Idumæa and Samaria, Judæa extends far and wide. That part of it\r\nwhich joins up to Syria[3638] is called Galilæa, while that which is\r\nnearest to Arabia and Egypt bears the name of Peræa[3639]. This last is\r\nthickly covered with rugged mountains, and is separated from the rest\r\nof Judæa by the river Jordanes. The remaining part of Judæa is divided\r\ninto ten Toparchies, which we will mention in the following order:—That\r\nof Hiericus[3640], covered with groves of palm-trees, and watered\r\nby numerous springs, and those of Emmaüs[3641], Lydda[3642], Joppe,\r\nAcrabatena[3643], Gophna[3644], Thamna[3645], Bethleptephene[3646],\r\nOrina[3647], in which formerly stood Hierosolyma[3648], by far the most\r\nfamous city, not of Judæa only, but of the East, and Herodium[3649],\r\nwith a celebrated town of the same name.\r\n\r\n(15.) The river Jordanes[3650] rises from the spring of Panias[3651],\r\nwhich has given its surname to Cæsarea, of which we shall have\r\noccasion to speak[3652]. This is a delightful stream, and, so far as\r\nthe situation of the localities will allow of, winds along[3653] in its\r\ncourse and lingers among the dwellers upon its banks. With the greatest\r\nreluctance, as it were, it moves onward towards Asphaltites[3654],\r\na lake of a gloomy and unpropitious nature, by which it is at last\r\nswallowed up, and its bepraised waters are lost sight of on being\r\nmingled with the pestilential streams of the lake. For this reason it\r\nis that, as soon as ever the valleys through which it runs afford it\r\nthe opportunity, it discharges itself into a lake, by many writers\r\nknown as Genesara[3655], sixteen miles in length and six wide; which is\r\nskirted by the pleasant towns of Julias[3656] and Hippo[3657] on the\r\neast, of Tarichea[3658] on the south (a name which is by many persons\r\ngiven to the lake itself), and of Tiberias[3659] on the west, the hot\r\nsprings[3660] of which are so conducive to the restoration of health.\r\n\r\n(16.) Asphaltites[3661] produces nothing whatever except bitumen,\r\nto which indeed it owes its name. The bodies of animals will not\r\nsink[3662] in its waters, and even those of bulls and camels float\r\nthere. In length it exceeds 100 miles being at its greatest breadth\r\ntwenty-five, and at its smallest six. Arabia of the Nomades[3663] faces\r\nit on the east, and Machærus on the south[3664], at one time, next to\r\nHierosolyma, the most strongly fortified place in Judæa. On the same\r\nside lies Callirrhoë[3665], a warm spring, remarkable for its medicinal\r\nqualities, and which, by its name, indicates the celebrity its waters\r\nhave gained.\r\n\r\n(17.) Lying on the west of Asphaltites, and sufficiently distant to\r\nescape its noxious exhalations, are the Esseni[3666], a people that\r\nlive apart from the world, and marvellous beyond all others throughout\r\nthe whole earth, for they have no women among them; to sexual desire\r\nthey are strangers; money they have none; the palm-trees are their only\r\ncompanions. Day after day, however, their numbers are fully recruited\r\nby multitudes of strangers that resort to them, driven thither to adopt\r\ntheir usages by the tempests of fortune, and wearied with the miseries\r\nof life. Thus it is, that through thousands of ages, incredible to\r\nrelate, this people eternally prolongs its existence, without a single\r\nbirth taking place there; so fruitful a source of population to it is\r\nthat weariness of life which is felt by others. Below this people was\r\nformerly the town of Engadda[3667], second only to Hierosolyma in the\r\nfertility of its soil and its groves of palm-trees; now, like it, it is\r\nanother heap of ashes. Next to it we come to Masada[3668], a fortress\r\non a rock, not far from Lake Asphaltites. Thus much concerning Judæa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16. (18.)—DECAPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the side of Syria, joining up to Judæa, is the region of\r\nDecapolis[3669], so called from the number of its cities; as to\r\nwhich all writers are not agreed. Most of them, however, agree in\r\nspeaking of Damascus[3670] as one, a place fertilized by the river\r\nChrysorroös[3671], which is drawn off into its meadows and eagerly\r\nimbibed; Philadelphia[3672], and Rhaphana[3673], all which cities\r\nfall back towards Arabia; Scythopolis[3674] (formerly called Nysa by\r\nFather Liber, from his nurse having been buried there), its present\r\nname being derived from a Scythian colony which was established there;\r\nGadara[3675], before which the river Hieromix[3676] flows; Hippo, which\r\nhas been previously mentioned; Dion[3677], Pella[3678], rich with its\r\nwaters; Galasa[3679], and Canatha[3680]. The Tetrarchies[3681] lie\r\nbetween and around these cities, equal, each of them, to a kingdom,\r\nand occupying the same rank as so many kingdoms. Their names are,\r\nTrachonitis[3682], Panias[3683], in which is Cæsarea, with the spring\r\npreviously mentioned[3684], Abila[3685], Arca[3686], Ampeloëssa[3687],\r\nand Gabe[3688].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17. (19.)—PHŒNICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the coast and to Phœnice. There was formerly a\r\ntown here known as Crocodilon; there is still a river[3689] of that\r\nname: Dorum[3690] and Sycaminon[3691] are the names of cities of\r\nwhich the remembrance only exists. We then come to the Promontory of\r\nCarmelus[3692], and, upon the mountain, a town[3693] of that name,\r\nformerly called Acbatana. Next to this are Getta[3694], Jeba, and the\r\nriver Pacida, or Belus[3695], which throws up on its narrow banks a\r\nkind of sand from which glass[3696] is made: this river flows from\r\nthe marshes of Cendebia, at the foot of Mount Carmelus. Close to this\r\nriver is Ptolemais, formerly called Ace[3697], a colony of Claudius\r\nCæsar; and then the town of Ecdippa[3698], and the promontory known as\r\nthe White Promontory[3699]. We next come to the city of Tyre[3700],\r\nformerly an island, separated from the mainland by a channel of the\r\nsea, of great depth, 700 paces in width, but now joined to it by the\r\nworks which were thrown up by Alexander when besieging it,—the Tyre so\r\nfamous in ancient times for its offspring, the cities to which it gave\r\nbirth, Leptis, Utica, and Carthage[3701],—that rival of the Roman sway,\r\nthat thirsted so eagerly for the conquest of the whole earth; Gades,\r\ntoo, which she founded beyond the limits of the world. At the present\r\nday, all her fame is confined to the production of the murex and the\r\npurple[3702]. Its circumference, including therein Palætyrus[3703],\r\nis nineteen miles, the place itself extending twenty-two stadia. The\r\nnext towns are Sarepta[3704] and Ornithon[3705], and then Sidon[3706],\r\nfamous for its manufacture of glass, and the parent of Thebes[3707] in\r\nBœotia.\r\n\r\n(20.) In the rear of this spot begins the chain of Libanus, which\r\nextends 1500 stadia, as far as Simyra; this district has the name\r\nof Cœle Syria. Opposite to this chain, and separated from it by\r\nan intervening valley, stretches away the range of Antilibanus,\r\nwhich was formerly connected with Libanus[3708] by a wall. Beyond\r\nit, and lying in the interior, is the region of Decapolis, and,\r\nwith it, the Tetrarchies already mentioned, and the whole expanse\r\nof Palæstina. On the coast, again, and lying beneath Libanus, is\r\nthe river Magoras[3709], the colony of Berytus[3710], which bears\r\nthe name of Felix Julia, the town of Leontos[3711], the river\r\nLycos[3712], Palæbyblos[3713], the river Adonis[3714], and the\r\ntowns of Byblos[3715], Botrys[3716], Gigarta[3717], Trieris[3718],\r\nCalamos[3719], Tripolis[3720], inhabited by the Tyrians, Sidonians,\r\nand Aradians; Orthosia[3721], the river Eleutheros[3722], the towns of\r\nSimyra and Marathos[3723]; and opposite, Arados[3724], a town seven\r\nstadia long, on an island, distant 200 paces from the mainland. After\r\npassing through the country in which the before-named mountains end and\r\nthe plains that lie between, Mount Bargylus[3725] is seen to rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—SYRIA ANTIOCHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere Phœnicia ends, and Syria recommences. The towns are, Carne[3726],\r\nBalanea[3727], Paltos[3728], and Gabale[3729]; then the promontory\r\nupon which is situate the free town of Laodicea[3730]; and then\r\nDiospolis[3731], Heraclea[3732], Charadrus[3733], and Posidium[3734].\r\n\r\n(21.) We then come to the Promontory of Syria Antiochia. In the\r\ninterior is the free city of Antiochia[3735] itself, surnamed\r\nEpidaphnes[3736], and divided by the river Orontes[3737]. On the\r\npromontory is Seleucia[3738], called Pieria, a free city.\r\n\r\n(22.) Beyond it lies Mount Casius[3739], a different one from the\r\nmountain of the same name[3740] which we have already mentioned. The\r\nheight of this mountain is so vast, that, at the fourth watch[3741] of\r\nthe night, you can see from it, in the midst of the darkness, the sun\r\nrising on the east; and thus, by merely turning round, we may at one\r\nand the same time behold both day and night. The winding road which\r\nleads to its summit is nineteen miles in length, its perpendicular\r\nheight four. Upon this coast there is the river Orontes, which takes\r\nits rise near Heliopolis[3742], between the range of Libanus and\r\nAntilibanus. The towns are, Rhosos[3743], and, behind it, the Gates\r\nof Syria[3744], lying in the space between the chain of the Rhosian\r\nmountains and that of Taurus. On the coast there is the town of\r\nMyriandros[3745], and Mount Amanus[3746], upon which is the town of\r\nBomitæ[3747]. This mountain separates Cilicia from Syria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19. (23.)—THE REMAINING PARTS OF SYRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now speak of the interior of Syria. Cœle Syria has the\r\ntown of Apamea[3748], divided by the river Marsyas from the\r\nTetrarchy of the Nazerini[3749]; Bambyx, the other name of which is\r\nHierapolis[3750], but by the Syrians called Mabog[3751], (here the\r\nmonster Atargatis[3752], called Derceto by the Greeks, is worshipped);\r\nand the place called Chalcis[3753] on the Belus[3754], from which the\r\nregion of Chalcidene, the most fertile part of Syria, takes its name.\r\nWe here find also Cyrrhestice, with Cyrrhum[3755], the Gazatæ, the\r\nGindareni, the Gabeni, the two Tetrarchies called Granucomatæ[3756],\r\nthe Emeseni[3757], the Hylatæ[3758], the nation of the Ituræi, and a\r\nbranch of them, the people called the Bætarreni; the Mariamitani[3759],\r\nthe Tetrarchy known as Mammisea, Paradisus[3760], Pagræ[3761], the\r\nPinaritæ[3762], two cities called Seleucia, besides the one already\r\nmentioned, the one Seleucia on the Euphrates[3763], and the other\r\nSeleucia[3764] on the Belus, and the Cardytenses. The remaining part of\r\nSyria (except those parts which will be spoken of in conjunction with\r\nthe Euphrates) contains the Arethusii[3765], the Berœenses[3766], and\r\nthe Epiphanæenses[3767]; and on the east, the Laodiceni[3768], who\r\nare called the Laodiceni on the Libanus, the Leucadii[3769], and the\r\nLarissæi, besides seventeen other Tetrarchies, divided into kingdoms\r\nand bearing barbarous names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20. (24.)—THE EUPHRATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis place, too, will be the most appropriate one for making some\r\nmention of the Euphrates. This river rises in Caranitis[3770], a\r\npræfecture of Greater Armenia, according to the statement of those\r\nwho have approached the nearest to its source. Domitius Corbulo\r\nsays, that it rises in Mount Aba; Licinius Mucianus, at the foot of\r\na mountain which he calls Capotes[3771], twelve miles above Zimara,\r\nand that at its source it has the name of Pyxurates. It first flows\r\npast Derxene[3772], and then Anaitica[3773], shutting out[3774] the\r\nregions of Armenia from Cappadocia. Dascusa[3775] is distant from\r\nZimara seventy-five miles; from this spot it is navigable as far as\r\nSartona[3776], a distance of fifty miles, thence to Melitene[3777],\r\nin Cappadocia, distant seventy-four[3778] miles, and thence to\r\nElegia[3779], in Armenia, distant ten miles; receiving in its course\r\nthe rivers Lycus[3780], Arsanias[3781], and Arsanus. At Elegia it meets\r\nthe range of Mount Taurus, but no effectual resistance is offered\r\nto its course, although the chain is here twelve miles in width. At\r\nits passage[3782] between the mountains, the river bears the name of\r\nOmma[3783]; but afterwards, when it has passed through, it receives\r\nthat of Euphrates. Beyond this spot it is full of rocks, and runs\r\nwith an impetuous tide. It then divides that part of Arabia which is\r\ncalled the country of the Orei[3784], on the left, by a channel three\r\nschœni[3785] in width, from the territory of the Commageni[3786] on the\r\nright, and it admits of a bridge being thrown across it, even where it\r\nforces a passage through the range of Taurus. At Claudiopolis[3787],\r\nin Cappadocia, it takes an easterly direction; and here, for the\r\nfirst time in this contest, Taurus turns it out of its course; though\r\nconquered before, and rent asunder by its channel, the mountain-chain\r\nnow gains the victory in another way, and, breaking its career, compels\r\nit to take a southerly direction. Thus is this warfare of nature\r\nequally waged,—the river proceeding onward to the destination which it\r\nintends to reach, and the mountains forbidding it to proceed by the\r\npath which it originally intended. After passing the Cataracts[3788],\r\nthe river again becomes navigable; and, at a distance of forty miles\r\nfrom thence, is Samosata[3789], the capital of Commagene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21.—SYRIA UPON THE EUPHRATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nArabia, above mentioned, has the cities of Edessa[3790], formerly\r\ncalled Antiochia, and, from the name of its fountain, Callirhoë[3791],\r\nand Carrhæ[3792], memorable for the defeat of Crassus there. Adjoining\r\nto this is the præfecture of Mesopotamia, which derives its origin\r\nfrom the Assyrians, and in which are the towns of Anthemusia[3793] and\r\nNicephorium[3794]; after which come the Arabians, known by the name of\r\nPrætavi, with Singara[3795] for their capital. Below Samosata, on the\r\nside of Syria, the river Marsyas[3796] flows into the Euphrates. At\r\nCingilla ends the territory of Commagene, and the state of the Immei\r\nbegins. The cities which are here washed by the river are those of\r\nEpiphania[3797] and Antiochia[3798], generally known as Epiphania and\r\nAntiochia on the Euphrates; also Zeugma, seventy-two miles distant from\r\nSamosata, famous for the passage there across the Euphrates. Opposite\r\nto it is Apamia[3799], which Seleucus, the founder of both cities,\r\nunited by a bridge. The people who join up to Mesopotamia are called\r\nthe Rhoali. Other towns in Syria are those of Europus[3800], and what\r\nwas formerly Thapsacus[3801], now Amphipolis. We then come to the\r\nArabian Scenitæ[3802]. The Euphrates then proceeds in its course till\r\nit reaches the place called Ura[3803], at which, taking a turn to the\r\neast, it leaves the Syrian Deserts of Palmyra[3804], which extend as\r\nfar as the city of Petra[3805] and the regions of Arabia Felix.\r\n\r\n(25.) Palmyra is a city famous for the beauty of its site, the riches\r\nof its soil, and the delicious quality and abundance of its water. Its\r\nfields are surrounded by sands on every side, and are thus separated,\r\nas it were, by nature from the rest of the world. Though placed between\r\nthe two great empires of Rome and Parthia, it still maintains[3806] its\r\nindependence; never failing, at the very first moment that a rupture\r\nbetween them is threatened, to attract the careful attention of both.\r\nIt is distant 337 miles from Seleucia[3807] of the Parthians, generally\r\nknown as Seleucia on the Tigris, 203 from the nearest part of the\r\nSyrian coast, and twenty-seven less from Damascus.\r\n\r\n(26.) Below the deserts of Palmyra is the region of Stelendene[3808],\r\nand Hierapolis, Berœa, and Chalcis, already mentioned[3809]. Beyond\r\nPalmyra, Emesa[3810] takes to itself a portion of these deserts;\r\nalso Elatium, nearer to Petra by one-half than Damascus. At no great\r\ndistance from Sura[3811] is Philiscum, a town of the Parthians, on\r\nthe Euphrates. From this place it is ten days’ sail to Seleucia, and\r\nnearly as many to Babylon. At a distance of 594 miles beyond Zeugma,\r\nnear the village of Massice, the Euphrates divides into two channels,\r\nthe left one of which runs through Mesopotamia, past Seleucia, and\r\nfalls into the Tigris as it flows around that city. Its channel on the\r\nright runs towards Babylon, the former capital of Chaldæa, and flows\r\nthrough the middle of it; and then through another city, the name of\r\nwhich is Otris[3812], after which it becomes lost in the marshes. Like\r\nthe Nile, this river increases at stated times, and at much about the\r\nsame period. When the sun has reached the twentieth degree of Cancer,\r\nit inundates[3813] Mesopotamia; and, after he has passed through Leo\r\nand entered Virgo, its waters begin to subside. By the time the sun has\r\nentered the twenty-ninth degree of Virgo, the river has fully regained\r\nits usual height.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (27.)—CILICIA AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut let us now return to the coast of Syria, joining up to which is\r\nCilicia. We here find the river Diaphanes[3814], Mount Crocodilus,\r\nthe Gates[3815] of Mount Amanus, the rivers Androcus[3816],\r\nPinarus[3817], and Lycus[3818], the Gulf of Issos[3819], and the\r\ntown of that name; then Alexandria[3820], the river Chlorus[3821],\r\nthe free town of Ægæ[3822], the river Pyramus[3823], the Gates[3824]\r\nof Cilicia, the towns of Mallos[3825] and Magarsos[3826], and, in\r\nthe interior, Tarsus[3827]. We then come to the Aleian Plains[3828],\r\nthe town of Cassipolis, Mopsos[3829], a free town on the river\r\nPyramus, Thynos, Zephyrium, and Anchiale[3830]. Next to these are\r\nthe rivers Saros[3831] and Cydnus[3832], the latter of which, at\r\nsome distance from the sea, runs through the free city of Tarsus,\r\nthe region of Celenderitis with a town[3833] of similar name, the\r\nplace where Nymphæum[3834] stood, Soli of Cilicia[3835], now called\r\nPompeiopolis, Adana[3836], Cibyra[3837], Pinare[3838], Pedalie[3839],\r\nAle, Selinus[3840], Arsinoë[3841], Iotape[3842], Doron, and, near the\r\nsea, Corycos, there being a town[3843], port, and cave[3844] all of\r\nthe same name. Passing these, we come to the river Calycadnus[3845],\r\nthe Promontory of Sarpedon[3846], the towns of Holmœ[3847] and Myle,\r\nand the Promontory and town of Venus[3848], at a short distance from\r\nthe island of Cyprus. On the mainland there are the towns of Myanda,\r\nAnemurium[3849], and Coracesium[3850], and the river Melas[3851],\r\nthe ancient boundary of Cilicia. In the interior the places more\r\nespecially worthy of mention are Anazarbus[3852], now called Cæsarea,\r\nAugusta, Castabala[3853], Epiphania[3854], formerly called Œniandos,\r\nEleusa[3855], Iconium[3856], Seleucia[3857] upon the river Calycadnus,\r\nsurnamed Tracheotis, a city removed[3858] from the sea-shore, where it\r\nhad the name of Holmia. Besides those already mentioned, there are in\r\nthe interior the rivers Liparis[3859], Bombos, Paradisus, and Mount\r\nImbarus[3860].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—ISAURIA AND THE HOMONADES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the geographers have mentioned Pamphylia as joining up to Cilicia,\r\nwithout taking any notice of the people of Isauria[3861]. Its cities\r\nare, in the interior, Isaura[3862], Clibanus, and Lalasis; it runs down\r\ntowards the sea by the side of Anemurium[3863] already mentioned. In\r\na similar manner also, all who have treated of this subject have been\r\nignorant of the existence of the nation of the Homonades bordering upon\r\nIsauria, and their town of Homona[3864] in the interior. There are\r\nforty-four other fortresses, which lie concealed amid rugged crags and\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—PISIDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pisidæ[3865], formerly called the Solymi, occupy the higher parts\r\nof the mountains. In their country there is the colony of Cæsarea, also\r\ncalled Antiochia[3866], and the towns of Oroanda[3867] and Sagalessos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—LYCAONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese people are bounded by Lycaonia[3868], which belongs to the\r\njurisdiction of the province of Asia[3869], to which also resort the\r\npeople of Philomelium[3870], Tymbrium[3871], Leucolithium[3872], Pelta,\r\nand Tyrium. To this jurisdiction is also added a Tetrarchy of Lycaonia\r\nin that part which joins up to Galatia, containing fourteen states,\r\nwith the famous city of Iconium[3873]. In Lycaonia itself the most\r\nnoted places are Thebasa[3874] on Taurus, and Hyde, on the confines of\r\nGalatia and Cappadocia. On the [western] side of Lycaonia, and above\r\nPamphylia, come the Milyæ[3875], a people descended from the Thracians;\r\ntheir city is Arycanda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—PAMPHYLIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe former name of Pamphylia[3876] was Mopsopia[3877]. The Pamphylian\r\nSea[3878] joins up to that of Cilicia. The towns of Pamphylia are\r\nSide[3879], Aspendum[3880], situate on the side of a mountain,\r\nPletenissum[3881], and Perga[3882]. There is also the Promontory of\r\nLeucolla, the mountain of Sardemisus, and the rivers Eurymedon[3883],\r\nwhich flows past Aspendus, and Catarrhactes[3884], near to which is\r\nLyrnesus: also the towns of Olbia[3885], and Phaselis[3886], the last\r\non this coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—MOUNT TAURUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdjoining to Pamphylia is the Sea of Lycia and the country of\r\nLycia[3887] itself, where the chain of Taurus, coming from the\r\neastern shores, terminates the vast Gulf[3888] by the Promontory\r\nof Chelidonium[3889]. Of immense extent, and separating nations\r\ninnumerable, after taking its first rise at the Indian Sea[3890], it\r\nbranches off to the north on the right-hand side, and on the left\r\ntowards the south. Then taking a direction towards the west, it would\r\ncut through the middle of Asia, were it not that the seas check it in\r\nits triumphant career along the land. It accordingly strikes off in a\r\nnortherly direction, and forming an arc, occupies an immense tract of\r\ncountry, nature, designedly as it were, every now and then throwing\r\nseas in the way to oppose its career; here the Sea of Phœnicia, there\r\nthe Sea of Pontus, in this direction the Caspian and Hyrcanian[3891],\r\nand then, opposite to them, the Lake Mæotis. Although somewhat\r\ncurtailed by these obstacles, it still winds along between them, and\r\nmakes its way even amidst these barriers; and victorious after all,\r\nit then escapes with its sinuous course to the kindred chain of the\r\nRiphæan mountains. Numerous are the names which it bears, as it is\r\ncontinuously designated by new ones throughout the whole of its course.\r\nIn the first part of its career it has the name of Imaüs[3892], after\r\nwhich it is known successively by the names of Emodus, Paropanisus,\r\nCircius, Cambades, Paryadres, Choatras, Oreges, Oroandes, Niphates,\r\nTaurus, and, where it even out-tops itself, Caucasus. Where it throws\r\nforth its arms as though every now and then it would attempt to invade\r\nthe sea, it bears the names of Sarpedon, Coracesius, Cragus, and then\r\nagain Taurus. Where also it opens and makes a passage to admit mankind,\r\nit still claims the credit of an unbroken continuity by giving the\r\nname of “Gates” to these passes, which in one place are called the\r\n“Gates of Armenia[3893],” in another the “Gates of the Caspian,” and\r\nin another the “Gates of Cilicia.” In addition to this, when it has\r\nbeen cut short in its onward career, it retires to a distance from the\r\nseas, and covers itself on the one side and the other with the names of\r\nnumerous nations, being called, on the right-hand side the Hyrcanian\r\nand the Caspian, and on the left the Paryadrian[3894], the Moschian,\r\nthe Amazonian, the Coraxican, and the Scythian chain. Among the Greeks\r\nit bears the one general name of Ceraunian[3895].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—LYCIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Lycia, after leaving its promontory[3896], we come to the town\r\nof Simena, Mount Chimæra[3897], which sends forth flames by night,\r\nand the city of Hephæstium[3898], the heights above which are also\r\nfrequently on fire. Here too formerly stood the city of Olympus[3899];\r\nnow we find the mountain places known as Gagæ[3900], Corydalla[3901],\r\nand Rhodiopolis[3902]. Near the sea is Limyra[3903] with a river of\r\nlike name, into which the Arycandus flows, Mount Masycites[3904],\r\nthe state of Andriaca[3905], Myra[3906], the towns of Aperræ[3907]\r\nand Antiphellos[3908], formerly called Habessus, and in a corner\r\nPhellos[3909], after which comes Pyrra, and then the city of\r\nXanthus[3910], fifteen miles from the sea, as also a river known by the\r\nsame name. We then come to Patara[3911], formerly Pataros, and Sidyma,\r\nsituate on a mountain. Next comes the Promontory of Cragus[3912], and\r\nbeyond it a gulf[3913], equal to the one that comes before it; upon it\r\nare Pinara[3914], and Telmessus[3915], the frontier town of Lycia.\r\n\r\nLycia formerly contained seventy towns, now it has but thirty-six.\r\nOf these, the most celebrated, besides those already mentioned, are\r\nCanas[3916], Candyba, so celebrated for the Œnian Grove, Podalia,\r\nChoma, past which the river Ædesa flows, Cyaneæ[3917], Ascandalis,\r\nAmelas, Noscopium, Tlos[3918], and Telandrus[3919]. It includes also\r\nin the interior the district of Cabalia, the three cities of which are\r\nŒnianda, Balbura[3920], and Bubon[3921].\r\n\r\nOn passing Telmessus we come to the Asiatic or Carpathian Sea, and the\r\ndistrict which is properly called Asia. Agrippa has divided this region\r\ninto two parts; one of which he has bounded on the east by Phrygia and\r\nLycaonia, on the west by the Ægean Sea, on the south by the Egyptian\r\nSea, and on the north by Paphlagonia, making its length to be 473\r\nmiles and its breadth 320. The other part he has bounded by the Lesser\r\nArmenia on the east, Phrygia, Lycaonia, and Pamphylia on the west, the\r\nprovince of Pontus on the north, and the Sea of Pamphylia on the south,\r\nmaking it 575 miles in length and 325 in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—CARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the adjoining coast is Caria[3922], then Ionia, and beyond it\r\nÆolis. Caria surrounds Doris, which lies in the middle, and runs down\r\non both sides of it to the sea. In it[3923] is the Promontory of\r\nPedalium[3924], the river Glaucus[3925], into which the Telmedium[3926]\r\ndischarges itself, the towns of Dædala[3927], Crya[3928], peopled by\r\nfugitives, the river Axon[3929], and the town of Calynda[3930].\r\n\r\n(28.) The river Indus[3931], which rises in the mountains of the\r\nCibyratæ[3932], receives sixty-five rivers which are constantly\r\nflowing, besides upwards of 100 mountain torrents. Here is the free\r\ntown of Caunos[3933], then the town of Pyrnos[3934], the port of\r\nCressa[3935], from which the island of Rhodes is distant twenty miles;\r\nthe place where Loryma formerly stood, the towns of Tisanusa[3936],\r\nParidion[3937], and Larymna[3938], the Gulf of Thymnias[3939], the\r\nPromontory of Aphrodisias[3940], the town of Hyda, the Gulf of Schœnus,\r\nand the district of Bubasus[3941]. There was formerly the town of\r\nAcanthus here, another name of which was Dulopolis. We then come to\r\nCnidos[3942], a free town, situate on a promontory, Triopia[3943], and\r\nafter that the towns of Pegusa and Stadia.\r\n\r\nAt this last town Doris begins; but, first, it may be as well to\r\ndescribe the districts that lie to the back of Caria and the several\r\njurisdictions in the interior. The first of these[3944] is called\r\nCibyratica, Cibyra being a town of Phrygia. Twenty-five states resort\r\nto it for legal purposes, together with the most famous city of\r\nLaodicea[3945].\r\n\r\n(29.) This place at first bore the name of Diospolis, and after\r\nthat of Rhoas, and is situate on the river Lycus, the Asopus and\r\nthe Caprus[3946] washing its sides. The other people belonging to\r\nthe same jurisdiction, whom it may be not amiss to mention, are the\r\nHydrelitæ[3947], the Themisones[3948], and the Hierapolitæ[3949].\r\nThe second jurisdiction receives its title from Synnas[3950]; to it\r\nresort the Lycaones[3951], the Appiani[3952], the Eucarpeni[3953],\r\nthe Dorylæi[3954], the Midæi, the Julienses[3955], and fifteen\r\nother peoples of no note. The third jurisdiction has its seat at\r\nApamea[3956], formerly called Celænæ[3957], and after that Cibotos.\r\nThis place is situate at the foot of Mount Signia, the Marsyas, the\r\nObrima, and the Orga, rivers which fall into the Mæander, flowing\r\npast it. Here the Marsyas, rising from the earth, again makes its\r\nappearance, but soon after buries itself once more at Aulocrenæ[3958],\r\nthe spot where Marsyas had the musical contest with Apollo as to\r\nsuperiority of skill in playing on the flute. Aulocrenæ is the name\r\ngiven to a valley which lies ten miles on the road towards Phrygia from\r\nApamea. As belonging to this jurisdiction, it may be as well to mention\r\nthe Metropolitæ[3959], the Dionysopolitæ[3960], the Euphorbeni[3961],\r\nthe Acmonenses[3962], the Pelteni[3963], and the Silbiani[3964],\r\nbesides nine other nations of no note.\r\n\r\nUpon the Gulf of Doris[3965] we have Leucopolis, Hamaxitos, Eleus,\r\nand Euthene[3966]. We then come to Pitaium, Eutane[3967], and\r\nHalicarnassus[3968], towns of Caria. To the jurisdiction of this last\r\nplace six towns were appended by Alexander the Great, Theangela[3969],\r\nSibde, Medmasa, Euralium, Pedasus, and Telmissus[3970]. Halicarnassus\r\nlies between two gulfs, those of Ceramus[3971] and Iasus[3972]. We\r\nthen come to Myndos[3973], and the former site of Palæomyndos;\r\nalso Nariandos, Neapolis[3974], Caryanda[3975], the free town of\r\nTermera[3976], Bargyla[3977], and the town of Iasus[3978], from which\r\nthe Iasian Gulf takes its name.\r\n\r\nCaria is especially distinguished for the fame of its places in\r\nthe interior; for here are Mylasa[3979], a free town, and that\r\nof Antiochia[3980], on the site of the former towns of Symmæthos\r\nand Cranaos: it is now surrounded by the rivers Mæander[3981] and\r\nOrsinus[3982]. In this district also was formerly Mæandropolis[3983];\r\nwe find also Eumenia[3984], situate on the river Cludros, the river\r\nGlaucus[3985], the town of Lysias and Orthosa[3986], the district\r\nof Berecynthus[3987], Nysa[3988], and Tralles[3989], also called\r\nEuanthia[3990], Seleucia, and Antiochia: it is washed by the river\r\nEudon, while the Thebais runs through it. Some authors say that a\r\nnation of Pygmies formerly dwelt here. Besides the preceding towns,\r\nthere are Thydonos, Pyrrha[3991], Eurome[3992], Heraclea[3993],\r\nAmyzon[3994], the free town of Alabanda[3995], which has given\r\nname to that jurisdiction, the free town of Stratonicea[3996],\r\nHynidos, Ceramus[3997], Trœzene[3998], and Phorontis. At a greater\r\ndistance[3999], but resorting to the same place of jurisdiction,\r\nare the Orthronienses, the Alindienses[4000] or Hippini, the\r\nXystiani[4001], the Hydissenses, the Apolloniatæ[4002], the\r\nTrapezopolitæ[4003], and the Aphrodisienses[4004], a free people.\r\nBesides the above, there are the towns of Coscinus[4005], and\r\nHarpasa[4006], situate on the river Harpasus[4007], which also passed\r\nthe town of Trallicon when it was in existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—LYDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nLydia, bathed by the sinuous and ever-recurring windings of the\r\nriver Mæander, lies extended above Ionia; it is joined by Phrygia on\r\nthe east and Mysia on the north, while on the south it runs up to\r\nCaria: it formerly had the name of Mæonia[4008]. Its place of the\r\ngreatest celebrity is Sardes[4009], which lies on the side of Mount\r\nTmolus[4010], formerly called Timolus. From this mountain, which\r\nis covered with vineyards, flows the river Pactolus[4011], also\r\ncalled the Chrysorroas, and the sources of the Tarnus: this famous\r\ncity, which is situate upon the Gygæan Lake[4012], used to be called\r\nHyde[4013] by the people of Mæonia. This jurisdiction is now called\r\nthat of Sardes, and besides the people of the places already mentioned,\r\nthe following now resort to it—the Macedonian Cadueni[4014], the\r\nLoreni, the Philadelpheni[4015], the Mæonii, situate on the river\r\nCogamus at the foot of Mount Tmolus, the Tripolitani, who are also\r\ncalled the Antoniopolitæ, situate on the banks of the Mæander, the\r\nApollonihieritæ[4016], the Mesotimolitæ[4017], and some others of no\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—IONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIonia begins at the Gulf of Iasos, and has a long winding coast with\r\nnumerous bays. First comes the Gulf of Basilicum[4018], then the\r\nPromontory[4019] and town of Posideum, and the oracle once called the\r\noracle of the Branchidæ[4020], but now of Didymæan Apollo, a distance\r\nof twenty stadia from the sea-shore. One hundred and eighty stadia\r\nthence is Miletus[4021], the capital of Ionia, which formerly had\r\nthe names of Lelegëis, Pityusa, and Anactoria, the mother of more\r\nthan ninety cities, founded upon all seas; nor must she be deprived\r\nof the honour of having Cadmus[4022] for her citizen, who was the\r\nfirst to write in prose. The river Mæander, rising from a lake in\r\nMount Aulocrene, waters many cities and receives numerous tributary\r\nstreams. It is so serpentine in its course, that it is often thought\r\nto turn back to the very spot from which it came. It first runs\r\nthrough the district of Apamea, then that of Eumenia, and then the\r\nplains of Bargyla; after which, with a placid stream it passes through\r\nCaria, watering all that territory with a slime of a most fertilizing\r\nquality, and then at a distance of ten stadia from Miletus with a\r\ngentle current enters the sea. We then come to Mount Latmus[4023],\r\nthe towns of Heraclea[4024], also called by the same name as the\r\nmountain, Carice, Myus[4025], said to have been first built by Ionians\r\nwho came from Athens, Naulochum[4026], and Priene[4027]. Upon that\r\npart of the coast which bears the name of Trogilia[4028] is the river\r\nGessus. This district is held sacred by all the Ionians, and thence\r\nreceives the name of Panionia. Near to it was formerly the town of\r\nPhygela, built by fugitives, as its name implies[4029], and that of\r\nMarathesium[4030]. Above these places is Magnesia[4031], distinguished\r\nby the surname of the “Mæandrian,” and sprung from Magnesia in\r\nThessaly: it is distant from Ephesus fifteen miles, and three more from\r\nTralles. It formerly had the names of Thessaloche and Androlitia, and,\r\nlying on the sea-shore, it has withdrawn from the sea the islands known\r\nas the Derasidæ[4032] and joined them to the mainland. In the interior\r\nalso is Thyatira[4033], washed by the Lycus; for some time it was also\r\ncalled Pelopia and Euhippia[4034].\r\n\r\nUpon the coast again is Mantium, and Ephesus[4035], which was founded\r\nby the Amazons[4036], and formerly called by so many names: Alopes at\r\nthe time of the Trojan war, after that Ortygia and Morges, and then\r\nSmyrna, with the surname of Trachia, as also Samornion and Ptelea.\r\nThis city is built on Mount Pion, and is washed by the Caÿster[4037],\r\na river which rises in the Cilbian range and brings down the waters of\r\nmany streams[4038], as also of Lake Pegasæus[4039], which receives\r\nthose discharged by the river Phyrites[4040]. From these streams there\r\naccumulates a large quantity of slime, which vastly increases the\r\nsoil, and has added to the mainland the island of Syrie[4041], which\r\nnow lies in the midst of its plains. In this city is the fountain of\r\nCalippia[4042] and the temple of Diana, which last is surrounded by two\r\nstreams, each known by the name of Selenus, and flowing from opposite\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Ephesus there is another Mantium, belonging to the\r\nColophonians, and in the interior Colophon[4043] itself, past which\r\nthe river Halesus[4044] flows. After this we come to the temple[4045]\r\nof the Clarian Apollo, and Lebedos[4046]: the city of Notium[4047]\r\nonce stood here. Next comes the Promontory of Coryceium[4048], and\r\nthen Mount Mimas, which projects 150 miles into the sea, and as it\r\napproaches the mainland sinks down into extensive plains. It was at\r\nthis place that Alexander the Great gave orders for the plain to be\r\ncut through, a distance of seven miles and a half, for the purpose of\r\njoining the two gulfs and making an island of Erythræ[4049] and Mimas.\r\nNear Erythræ formerly stood the towns of Pteleon, Helos, and Dorion;\r\nwe now find the river Aleon, Corynæum, a Promontory of Mount Mimas,\r\nClazomenæ[4050], Parthenie[4051], and Hippi[4052], known by the name\r\nof Chytrophoria, when it formed a group of islands; these were united\r\nto the continent by the same Alexander, by means of a causeway[4053]\r\ntwo stadia in length. In the interior, the cities of Daphnus, Hermesia,\r\nand Sipylum[4054], formerly called Tantalis, and the capital of Mæonia,\r\nwhere Lake Sale now stands, are now no longer in existence: Archæopolis\r\ntoo, which succeeded Sipylum, has perished, and in their turns Colpe\r\nand Libade, which succeeded it.\r\n\r\nOn returning thence[4055] towards the coast, at a distance of twelve\r\nmiles we find Smyrna[4056], originally founded by an Amazon [of that\r\nname], and rebuilt by Alexander; it is refreshed by the river Meles,\r\nwhich rises not far off. Through this district run what may almost\r\nbe called the most famous mountains of Asia, Mastusia in the rear of\r\nSmyrna, and Termetis[4057], joining the foot of Olympus. Termetis is\r\njoined by Draco, Draco running into Tmolus, Tmolus into Cadmus[4058],\r\nand Cadmus into Taurus. Leaving Smyrna, the river Hermus forms a tract\r\nof plains, and gives them its own name. It rises near Dorylæum[4059], a\r\ncity of Phrygia, and in its course receives several rivers, among them\r\nthe one called the Phryx, which divides Caria from the nation to which\r\nit gives name; also the Hyllus[4060] and the Cryos, themselves swollen\r\nby the rivers of Phrygia, Mysia, and Lydia. At the mouth of the Hermus\r\nformerly stood the town of Temnos[4061]: we now see at the extremity of\r\nthe gulf[4062] the rocks called Myrmeces[4063], the town of Leuce[4064]\r\non a promontory which was once an island, and Phocæa[4065], the\r\nfrontier town of Ionia.\r\n\r\nA great part also of Æolia, of which we shall have presently to speak,\r\nhas recourse to the jurisdiction of Smyrna; as well as the Macedones,\r\nsurnamed Hyrcani[4066], and the Magnetes[4067] from Sipylus. But to\r\nEphesus, that other great luminary of Asia, resort the more distant\r\npeoples known as the Cæsarienses[4068], the Metropolitæ[4069], the\r\nCilbiani[4070], both the Lower and Upper, the Mysomacedones[4071], the\r\nMastaurenses[4072], the Briulitæ[4073], the Hypæpeni[4074], and the\r\nDioshïeritæ[4075].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32. (30.)—ÆOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nÆolis[4076] comes next, formerly known as Mysia, and Troas which\r\nis adjacent to the Hellespont. Here, after passing Phocæa, we come\r\nto the Ascanian Port, then the spot where Larissa[4077] stood, and\r\nthen Cyme[4078], Myrina, also called Sebastopolis[4079], and in the\r\ninterior, Ægæ[4080], Attalia[4081], Posidea, Neontichos[4082], and\r\nTemnos[4083]. Upon the shore we come to the river Titanus, and the\r\ncity which from it derives its name. Grynia[4084] also stood here on\r\nan island reclaimed from the sea and joined to the land: now only its\r\nharbours are left[4085]. We then come to the town of Elæa[4086], the\r\nriver Caïcus[4087], which flows from Mysia, the town of Pitane[4088],\r\nand the river Canaïus. The following towns no longer exist—Canæ[4089],\r\nLysimachia[4090], Atarnea[4091], Carene[4092], Cisthene[4093],\r\nCilla[4094], Cocylium[4095], Theba[4096], Astyre[4097], Chrysa[4098],\r\nPalæscepsis[4099], Gergitha[4100], and Neandros[4101]. We then come\r\nto the city of Perperene[4102], which still survives, the district\r\nof Heracleotes, the town of Coryphas[4103], the rivers Grylios and\r\nOllius, the region of Aphrodisias[4104], which formerly had the name\r\nof Politice Orgas, the district of Scepsis[4105], and the river\r\nEvenus[4106], on whose banks the towns of Lyrnesos[4107] and Miletos\r\nhave fallen to decay. In this district also is Mount Ida[4108], and\r\non the coast Adramytteos[4109], formerly called Pedasus, which gives\r\nits name to the gulf and the jurisdiction so called. The other rivers\r\nare the Astron, Cormalos, Crianos, Alabastros, and Hieros, flowing\r\nfrom Mount Ida: in the interior is Mount Gargara[4110], with a town\r\nof the same name. Again, on the coast we meet with Antandros[4111],\r\nformerly called Edonis, and after that Cimmeris and Assos, also\r\ncalled Apollonia. The town of Palamedium also formerly stood here.\r\nThe Promontory of Lecton[4112] separates Æolis from Troas. In Æolis\r\nthere was formerly the city of Polymedia, as also Chrysa, and a\r\nsecond Larissa. The temple of Smintheus[4113] is still standing;\r\nColone[4114] in the interior has perished. To Adramyttium resort upon\r\nmatters of legal business the Apolloniatæ[4115], whose town is on\r\nthe river Rhyndacus[4116], the Erizii[4117], the Miletopolitæ[4118],\r\nthe Pœmaneni[4119], the Macedonian Asculacæ, the Polichnæi[4120],\r\nthe Pionitæ[4121], the Cilician Mandacadeni, and, in Mysia, the\r\nAbrettini[4122], the people known as the Hellespontii[4123], and others\r\nof less note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33.—TROAS AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first place in Troas is Hamaxitus[4124], then Cebrenia[4125],\r\nand then Troas[4126] itself, formerly called Antigonia, and now\r\nAlexandria, a Roman colony. We then come to the town of Nee[4127], the\r\nScamander[4128], a navigable river, and the spot where in former times\r\nthe town of Sigeum[4129] stood, upon a promontory. We next come to the\r\nPort of the Achæans[4130], into which the Xanthus[4131] flows after\r\nits union with the Simois[4132], and forms the Palæscamander[4133],\r\nwhich was formerly a lake. The other rivers, rendered famous by Homer,\r\nnamely, the Rhesus, the Heptaporus, the Caresus, and the Rhodius,\r\nhave left no vestiges of their existence. The Granicus[4134], taking\r\na different route, flows into the Propontis[4135]. The small city of\r\nScamandria, however, still exists, and, at a distance of a mile and a\r\nhalf from its harbour, Ilium[4136], a place exempt from tribute[4137],\r\nthe fountain-head of universal fame. Beyond the gulf are the shores of\r\nRhœteum[4138], peopled by the towns of Rhœteum[4139], Dardanium[4140],\r\nand Arisbe[4141]. There was also in former times a town of\r\nAchilleon[4142], founded near the tomb of Achilles by the people of\r\nMitylene, and afterwards rebuilt by the Athenians, close to the spot\r\nwhere his fleet had been stationed near Sigeum. There was also the town\r\nof Æantion[4143], founded by the Rhodians upon the opposite point,\r\nnear the tomb of Ajax, at a distance of thirty stadia from Sigeum,\r\nnear the spot where his fleet was stationed. Above Æolis and part of\r\nTroas, in the interior, is the place called Teuthrania[4144], inhabited\r\nin ancient times by the Mysians. Here rises the river Caïcus already\r\nmentioned. Teuthrania was a powerful nation in itself, even when the\r\nwhole of Æolis was held by the Mysians. In it are the Pioniæ[4145],\r\nAndera[4146], Cale, Stabulum, Conisium, Teium, Balcea[4147], Tiare,\r\nTeuthranie, Sarnaca, Haliserne, Lycide, Parthenium, Thymbre, Oxyopum,\r\nLygdamum, Apollonia, and Pergamum[4148], by far the most famous\r\ncity in Asia, and through which the river Selinus runs; the Cetius,\r\nwhich rises in Mount Pindasus, flowing before it. Not far from it is\r\nElæa, which we have mentioned[4149] as situate on the sea-shore. The\r\njurisdiction of this district is called that of Pergamus; to it resort\r\nthe Thyatireni[4150], the Mosyni, the Mygdones[4151], the Bregmeni, the\r\nHierocometæ[4152], the Perpereni, the Tiareni, the Hierolophienses,\r\nthe Hermocapelitæ, the Attalenses[4153], the Panteenses, the\r\nApollonidienses, and some other states unknown to fame. The little town\r\nof Dardanum[4154] is distant from Rhœteum seventy stadia. Eighteen\r\nmiles thence is the Promontory of Trapeza[4155], from which spot the\r\nHellespont first commences its course.\r\n\r\nEratosthenes tells us that in Asia there have perished the nations\r\nof the Solymi[4156], the Leleges[4157], the Bebryces[4158], the\r\nColycantii, and the Tripsedri. Isidorus adds to these the Arimi[4159],\r\nas also the Capretæ, settled on the spot where Apamea[4160] stands,\r\nwhich was founded by King Seleucus, between Cilicia, Cappadocia,\r\nCataonia, and Armenia, and was at first called Damea[4161], from the\r\nfact that it had conquered nations most remarkable for their fierceness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34. (31.)—THE ISLANDS WHICH LIE IN FRONT OF ASIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the islands which lie before Asia the first is the one situate in\r\nthe Canopic Mouth of the Nile, and which received its name, it is\r\nsaid, from Canopus, the pilot of Menelaüs. A second, called Pharos, is\r\njoined by a bridge to Alexandria, and was made a colony by the Dictator\r\nCæsar. In former times it was one day’s sail[4162] from the mainland\r\nof Egypt; at the present day it directs ships in their course by means\r\nof the fires which are lighted at night on the tower[4163] there;\r\nfor in consequence of the insidious nature of the shoals, there are\r\nonly three channels by which Alexandria can be approached, those of\r\nSteganus[4164], Posideum[4165] and Taurus.\r\n\r\nIn the Phœnician Sea, before Joppe there is the island of Paria[4166],\r\nthe whole of it forming a town. Here, they say, Andromeda was exposed\r\nto the monster: the island also of Arados, already mentioned[4167],\r\nbetween which and the continent, as we learn from Mucianus, at a depth\r\nof fifty cubits in the sea, fresh water is brought up from a spring at\r\nthe very bottom by means of leather pipes[4168].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35.—CYPRUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pamphylian Sea contains some islands of little note. The Cilician,\r\nbesides four others of very considerable size, has Cyprus[4169],\r\nwhich lies opposite to the shores of Cilicia and Syria, running\r\neast and west; in former times it was the seat of nine kingdoms.\r\nTimosthenes states that the circumference of this island is 427\r\nmiles, Isidorus[4170] 375; its length, between the two Promontories\r\nof Dinæ[4171] and Acamas[4172] lying on the west, is, according to\r\nArtemidorus, 160-1/2 miles, according to Timosthenes, 200. Philonides\r\nsays that it was formerly called Acamantis, Xenagoras that it had\r\nthe names of Cerastis[4173], Aspelia, Amathusia, and Macaria[4174],\r\nwhile Astynomus gives it the names of Cryptos[4175] and Colinia.\r\nIts towns are fifteen in number, Neapaphos[4176], Palæpaphos[4177],\r\nCurias[4178], Citium[4179], Corineum, Salamis[4180], Amathus[4181],\r\nLapethos[4182], Solœ, Tamasos[4183], Epidarum, Chytri[4184],\r\nArsinoë[4185], Carpasium[4186], and Golgi[4187]. The towns of Cinyria,\r\nMarium, and Idalium[4188] are no longer in existence. It is distant\r\nfrom Anemurium[4189] in Cilicia fifty miles; the sea which runs between\r\nthe two shores being called the Channel of Cilicia[4190]. In the same\r\nlocality[4191] is the island of Eleusa[4192], and the four islands\r\nknown as the Clides[4193], lying before the promontory which faces\r\nSyria; and again at the end of the other cape[4194] is Stiria: over\r\nagainst Neapaphos is Hierocepia[4195], and opposite to Salamis are the\r\nSalaminiæ.\r\n\r\nIn the Lycian Sea are the islands of Illyris, Telendos, and\r\nAttelebussa[4196], the three barren isles called Cypriæ, and Dionysia,\r\nformerly called Caretha. Opposite to the Promontory of Taurus are\r\nthe Chelidoniæ[4197], as many in number, and extremely dangerous to\r\nmariners. Further on we find Leucolla with its town, the Pactyæ[4198],\r\nLasia, Nymphäis, Macris, and Megista, the city on which last no longer\r\nexists. After these there are many that are not worthy of notice.\r\nOpposite, however, to Cape Chimæra is Dolichiste[4199], Chœrogylion,\r\nCrambussa[4200], Rhoge[4201], Enagora, eight miles in circumference,\r\nthe two islands of Dædala[4202], the three of Crya[4203], Strongyle,\r\nand over against Sidyma[4204] the isle of Antiochus. Towards the mouth\r\nof the river Glaucus[4205], there are Lagussa[4206], Macris, Didymæ,\r\nHelbo, Scope, Aspis, Telandria, the town of which no longer exists,\r\nand, in the vicinity of Caunus[4207], Rhodussa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36.—RHODES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the fairest of them all is the free island of Rhodes, 125, or,\r\nif we would rather believe Isidorus, 103 miles in circumference.\r\nIt contains the inhabited cities of Lindos, Camirus[4208], and\r\nIalysus[4209], now called Rhodos. It is distant from Alexandria\r\nin Egypt, according to Isidorus, 583 miles; but, according to\r\nEratosthenes, 469. Mucianus says, that its distance from Cyprus is\r\n166. This island was formerly called Ophiussa[4210], Asteria[4211],\r\nÆthria[4212], Trinacrie[4213], Corymbia[4214], Pœeëssa[4215],\r\nAtabyria[4216], from the name of one of its kings; and, in later\r\ntimes, Macaria[4217] and Oloessa[4218]. The islands of the Rhodians\r\nare Carpathus[4219], which has given its name to the surrounding sea;\r\nCasos[4220], formerly known as Achne[4221]; Nisyros[4222], twelve miles\r\ndistant from Cnidos, and formerly called Porphyris[4223]; and, in the\r\nsame vicinity, midway between Rhodes and Cnidos, Syme[4224]. This\r\nisland is thirty-seven miles and a half in circumference, and welcomes\r\nus with eight fine harbours. Besides these islands, there are, in the\r\nvicinity of Rhodes, those of Cyclopis, Teganon, Cordylussa[4225], the\r\nfour islands called Diabetæ[4226], Hymos, Chalce[4227], with its city\r\nof that name, Seutlussa[4228], Narthecussa[4229], Dimastos, Progne;\r\nand, off Cnidos, Cisserussa, Therionarce, and Calydne[4230], with the\r\nthree towns of Notium, Nisyros, and Mendeterus. In Arconnesus[4231]\r\nthere is the town of Ceramus. Off the coast of Caria, there are the\r\nislands known as the Argiæ, twenty in number; also Hyetussa[4232],\r\nLepsia, and Leros.\r\n\r\nThe most noted island, however, in this gulf is that of Cos[4233],\r\nfifteen miles distant from Halicarnassus, and 100 in circumference,\r\naccording to the opinion of many writers. It was formerly called\r\nMerope; according to Staphylus, Cea; Meropis, as Dionysius tells\r\nus; and, after that, Nymphæa. In this island there is Mount Prion.\r\nNisyros[4234], formerly called Porphyris, is supposed to have been\r\nsevered from the island of Cos. We next come to the island of\r\nCaryanda[4235], with a city of that name, and that of Pidosus[4236],\r\nnot far from Halicarnassus. In the Gulf of Ceramicus we also find\r\nPriaponnesos[4237], Hipponnesos, Psyra, Mya, Lampsa, Æmyndus, Passala,\r\nCrusa, Pinnicussa, Sepiussa[4238], and Melano. At a short distance from\r\nthe mainland is an island which bears the name of Cinædopolis, from the\r\ncircumstance that King Alexander left behind there certain persons of a\r\nmost disgraceful character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37.—SAMOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coast of Ionia has the islands of Trageæ, Corseæ[4239], and Icaros,\r\nwhich has been previously[4240] mentioned; Lade[4241], formerly\r\ncalled Late; and, among others of no note, the two Camelidæ[4242], in\r\nthe vicinity of Miletus; and the three Trogiliæ[4243], near Mycale,\r\nconsisting of Philion, Argennon, and Sandalion. There is Samos also, a\r\nfree[4244] island, eighty-seven miles in circumference, or, according\r\nto Isidorus, 100. Aristotle tells us, that it was at first called\r\nParthenia[4245], after that Dryussa[4246], and then Anthemussa[4247].\r\nTo these names Aristocritus has added Melamphyllus[4248] and\r\nCyparissia[4249]: other writers, again, call it Parthenoarussa[4250]\r\nand Stephane[4251]. The rivers of this island are the Imbrasus, the\r\nChesius, and the Ibettes. There are also the fountains of Gigartho\r\nand Leucothea; and Mount Cercetius. In the vicinity of Samos are the\r\nislands of Rhypara, Nymphæa, and Achillea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38.—CHIOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a distance of ninety-four miles from Samos is the free island of\r\nChios[4252], its equal in fame, with a town of the same name. Ephorus\r\nsays, that the ancient name of this island was Æthalia; Metrodorus and\r\nCleobulus tell us, that it had the name of Chia from the nymph Chione;\r\nothers again say, that it was so called from the word signifying\r\nsnow[4253]; it was also called Macris and Pityusa[4254]. It has a\r\nmountain called Pelennæus; and the Chian marble is well known. It is\r\n125[4255] miles in circumference, according to the ancient writers;\r\nIsidorus however makes it nine more. It is situate between Samos and\r\nLesbos, and, for the most part, lies opposite to Erythræ[4256].\r\n\r\nThe adjacent islands, are Thallusa[4257], by some writers called\r\nDaphnusa[4258], Œnussa, Elaphitis, Euryanassa, and Arginusa, with a\r\ntown of that name. All these islands are in the vicinity of Ephesus,\r\nas also those called the Islands of Pisistratus, Anthinæ, Myonnesos,\r\nDiarreusa,—in both of these last there were cities, now no longer\r\nin existence,—Poroselene[4259], with a city of that name, Cerciæ,\r\nHalone[4260], Commone, Illetia, Lepria and Rhesperia, Procusæ, Bolbulæ,\r\nPhanæ, Priapos, Syce, Melane, Ænare, Sidusa, Pele, Drymusa[4261],\r\nAnhydros, Scopelos[4262], Sycussa, Marathussa, Psile, Perirreusa, and\r\nmany others of no note. In the main sea lies the celebrated island of\r\nTeos, with a city[4263] of that name, seventy-one miles and a half\r\ndistant from Chios, and the same from the Erythræ.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Smyrna are the Peristerides[4264], Carteria,\r\nAlopece, Elæussa, Bachina, Pystira, Crommyonnesos, and Megale[4265].\r\nFacing Troas there are the Ascaniæ, and the three islands called\r\nPlateæ. We find also the Lamiæ, the two islands called Plitaniæ, Plate,\r\nScopelos, Getone, Arthedon, Cœlæ, Lagussæ, and Didymæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39.—LESBOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Lesbos[4266], distant from Chios sixty-five miles, is the most\r\ncelebrated of them all. It was formerly called Himerte, Lasia,\r\nPelasgia, Ægira, Æthiope, and Macaria, and is famous for its nine\r\ncities. Of these, however, that of Pyrrha has been swallowed up by the\r\nsea, Arisbe[4267] has perished by an earthquake, and Methymna is now\r\nunited to Antissa[4268]; these lie in the vicinity of nine cities of\r\nAsia, along a coast of thirty-seven miles. The towns of Agamede and\r\nHiera have also perished. Eresos[4269], Pyrrha, and the free city of\r\nMitylene[4270], still survive, the last of which was a powerful city\r\nfor a space of 1500 years. The circumference of the whole island is,\r\naccording to Isidorus, 168 miles[4271], but the older writers say 195.\r\nIts mountains are, Lepethymnus, Ordymnus, Macistus, Creon, and Olympus.\r\nIt is distant seven miles and a half from the nearest point of the\r\nmainland. The islands in its vicinity are, Sandaleon, and the five\r\ncalled Leucæ[4272]; Cydonea[4273], which is one of them, contains a\r\nwarm spring. The Arginussæ[4274] are four miles distant from Æge[4275];\r\nafter them come Phellusa[4276] and Pedna. Beyond the Hellespont, and\r\nopposite the shore of Sigeum, lies Tenedos[4277], also known by the\r\nnames of Leucophrys[4278], Phœnice, and Lyrnesos. It is distant from\r\nLesbos fifty-six miles, and twelve and a half from Sigeum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40. (32.)—THE HELLESPONT AND MYSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tide of the Hellespont now begins to run with greater violence,\r\nand the sea beats against the shore, undermining with its eddies the\r\nbarriers that stand in its way, until it has succeeded in separating\r\nAsia from Europe. At this spot is the promontory which we have already\r\nmentioned as Trapeza[4279]; ten miles distant from which is the city\r\nof Abydos[4280], where the straits are only seven stadia wide; then\r\nthe town of Percote[4281]; Lampsacus[4282], at first called Pityusa;\r\nthe colony of Parium[4283], which Homer calls by the name of Adrastia;\r\nthe town of Priapos[4284]; the river Æsepus[4285]; Zelia[4286]; and\r\nthen the Propontis[4287], that being the name given to the tract of\r\nsea where it enlarges. We then come to the river Granicus[4288], and\r\nthe harbour of Artace[4289], where a town formerly stood. Beyond\r\nthis is an island which Alexander joined to the continent, and upon\r\nwhich is Cyzicus[4290], a city of the Milesians, which was formerly\r\ncalled Arctonnesos[4291], Dolionis, and Dindymis; above it are the\r\nheights of Mount Dindymus[4292]. We then come to the towns of Placia,\r\nAriace[4293], and Scylace; in the rear of which places is Mount\r\nOlympus, known as the “Mysian Olympus,” and the city of Olympena. There\r\nare also the rivers Horisius[4294] and Rhyndacus[4295], formerly called\r\nthe Lycus; this last river rises in Lake Artynias, near Miletopolis,\r\nand receives the Macestos, and many other streams, dividing in its\r\ncourse Asia[4296] from Bithynia[4297].\r\n\r\nThis country was at first called by the name of Cronia, after that,\r\nThessalis, and then Malianda and Strymonis. The people of it are by\r\nHomer called Halizones[4298], from the fact that it was a nation\r\nbegirt by the sea. There was formerly a vast city here, Attussa\r\nby name; at present there are twelve cities in existence; among\r\nwhich is Gordiucome[4299], otherwise Juliopolis; and, on the coast,\r\nDascylos[4300]. We then come to the river Gelbes[4301]; and, in the\r\ninterior, the town of Helgas, or Germanicopolis, which has also the\r\nother name of Booscœte[4302]; Apamea[4303], now more generally known\r\nas Myrlea of the Colophonians: the river Etheleus also, the ancient\r\nboundary of Troas, and the commencement of Mysia. Next to this comes\r\nthe gulf[4304] into which the river Ascanius flows, the town of\r\nBryllion[4305], and the rivers Hylas and Cios, with a town of the same\r\nname as the last-mentioned river; it was founded by the Milesians at\r\na place which was called Ascania of Phrygia, as an entrepôt for the\r\ntrade of the Phrygians who dwelt in the vicinity. We may therefore look\r\nupon this as a not ineligible opportunity for making further mention of\r\nPhrygia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41.—PHRYGIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhrygia lies above Troas, and the peoples already mentioned as\r\nextending from the Promontory of Lectum[4306] to the river Etheleus.\r\nOn its northern side it borders upon Galatia, on the south it joins\r\nLycaonia, Pisidia, and Mygdonia, and, on the east, it touches upon\r\nCappadocia. The more celebrated towns there, besides those already\r\nmentioned, are Ancyra[4307], Andria, Celænæ[4308], Colossæ[4309],\r\nCarina[4310], Cotyaion[4311], Ceraine, Conium, and Midaium. There are\r\nauthors who say that the Mœsi, the Brygi, and the Thyni crossed over\r\nfrom Europe, and that from them are descended the peoples called the\r\nMysi, Phryges, and Bithyni.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42.—GALATIA AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this occasion also it seems that we ought to speak of Galatia[4312],\r\nwhich lies above Phrygia, and includes the greater part of the\r\nterritory taken from that province, as also its former capital,\r\nGordium[4313]. The Gauls[4314] who have settled in these parts, are\r\ncalled the Tolistobogi, the Voturi, and the Ambitouti; those who\r\ndwell in Mæonia and Paphlagonia are called the Trocmi. Cappadocia\r\nstretches along to the north-east of Galatia, its most fertile parts\r\nbeing possessed by the Tectosages and the Teutobodiaci. These are\r\nthe nations by which those parts are occupied; and they are divided\r\ninto peoples and tetrarchies, 195 in number. Its towns are, among the\r\nTectosages, Ancyra[4315]; among the Trocmi, Tavium[4316]; and, among\r\nthe Tolistobogi, Pessinus[4317]. Besides the above, the best known\r\namong the peoples of this region are the Actalenses, the Arasenses, the\r\nComenses[4318], the Didienses, the Hierorenses, the Lystreni[4319],\r\nthe Neapolitani, the Œandenses, the Seleucenses[4320], the\r\nSebasteni[4321], the Timoniacenses[4322], and the Thebaseni[4323].\r\nGalatia also touches upon Carbalia in Pamphylia, and the Milyæ[4324],\r\nabout Baris; also upon Cyllanticum and Oroandicum[4325], a district\r\nof Pisidia, and Obizene, a part of Lycaonia. Besides those already\r\nmentioned[4326], its rivers are the Sangarius[4327] and the\r\nGallus[4328], from which last the priests[4329] of the Mother of the\r\ngods have taken their name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43.—BITHYNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now as to the remaining places on this coast. On the road from Cios\r\ninto the interior is Prusa[4330], in Bithynia, founded by Hannibal at\r\nthe foot of Olympus, at a distance of twenty-five miles from Nicæa,\r\nLake Ascanius[4331] lying between them. We then come to Nicæa[4332],\r\nformerly called Olbia, and situate at the bottom of the Ascanian Gulf;\r\nas also a second place called Prusa[4333], at the foot of Mount Hypius.\r\nPythopolis, Parthenopolis, and Coryphanta are no longer in existence.\r\nAlong the coast we find the rivers Æsius, Bryazon, Plataneus, Areus,\r\nÆsyros, Geodos, also called Chrysorroas[4334], and the promontory[4335]\r\nupon which once stood the town of Megarice. The gulf that here runs\r\ninland received the name of Craspedites from the circumstance of that\r\ntown lying, as it were, upon its skirt[4336]. Astacum[4337], also,\r\nformerly stood here, from which the same gulf has received the name\r\nof the ‘Astacenian’: the town of Libyssa[4338] formerly stood at\r\nthe spot where we now see nothing but the tomb of Hannibal. At the\r\nbottom of the gulf lies Nicomedia[4339], a famous city of Bithynia;\r\nthen comes the Promontory of Leucatas[4340], by which the Astacenian\r\nGulf is bounded, and thirty-seven miles distant from Nicomedia; and\r\nthen, the land again approaching the other side, the straits[4341]\r\nwhich extend as far as the Thracian Bosporus. Upon these are situate\r\nChalcedon[4342], a free town, sixty-two miles from Nicomedia, formerly\r\ncalled Procerastis[4343], then Colpusa, and after that the “City of\r\nthe Blind,” from the circumstance that its founders did not know where\r\nto build their city, Byzantium being only seven stadia distant, a site\r\nwhich is preferable in every respect.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of Bithynia are the colony of Apamea[4344], the\r\nAgrippenses, the Juliopolitæ, and Bithynion[4345]; the rivers Syrium,\r\nLaphias, Pharnacias, Alces, Serinis, Lilæus, Scopius, and Hieras[4346],\r\nwhich separates Bithynia from Galatia. Beyond Chalcedon formerly stood\r\nChrysopolis[4347], and then Nicopolis, of which the gulf, upon which\r\nstands the Port of Amycus[4348], still retains the name; then the\r\nPromontory of Naulochum, and Estiæ[4349], a temple of Neptune[4350].\r\nWe then come to the Bosporus, which again separates Asia from Europe,\r\nthe distance across being half a mile; it is distant twelve miles\r\nand a half from Chalcedon. The first entrance of this strait is\r\neight miles and three-quarters wide, at the place where the town of\r\nSpiropolis[4351] formerly stood. The Thyni occupy the whole of the\r\ncoast, the Bithyni the interior. This is the termination of Asia,\r\nand of the 282 peoples, that are to be found between the Gulf of\r\nLycia[4352] and this spot. We have already[4353] mentioned the length\r\nof the Hellespont and Propontis to the Thracian Bosporus as being 239\r\nmiles; from Chalcedon to Sigeum, Isidorus makes the distance 322-1/2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—THE ISLANDS OF THE PROPONTIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe islands of the Propontis are, before Cyzicus, Elaphonnesus[4354],\r\nfrom whence comes the Cyzican marble; it is also known by the names\r\nof Neuris and Proconnesus. Next come Ophiussa[4355], Acanthus, Phœbe,\r\nScopelos, Porphyrione, Halone[4356], with a city of that name,\r\nDelphacia, Polydora, and Artaceon, with its city. There is also,\r\nopposite to Nicomedia, Demonnesos[4357]; and, beyond Heraclea, and\r\nopposite to Bithynia, the island of Thynias, by the barbarians called\r\nBithynia; the island of Antiochia: and, at the mouth of the Rhyndacus,\r\nBesbicos[4358], eighteen miles in circumference; the islands also of\r\nElæa, the two called Rhodussæ, and those of Erebinthus[4359], Megale,\r\nChalcitis[4360], and Pityodes[4361].\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Towns and nations spoken of ****.

His acrimony may however, in this instance, have\r\noutstripped his discretion. Though indebted to them for by far the\r\nlargest amount of his information on almost every subject, he seems to\r\nhave had a strong aversion to the Greeks, and repeatedly charges them\r\nwith lying, viciousness, boasting, and vanity. See B. ii. c. 112; B.\r\niii. c. 6; B. v. c. 1; B. xv. c. 5; B. xix. c. 26; B. xxviii. c. 29; B.\r\nxxxvii. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[19] Of Vespasian and Titus for certain; and probably of Nero, who\r\nappointed him “procurator Cæsaris” in Spain.\r\n\r\n[20] Even on that point he contradicts himself in the next Book.

Vol. 35. Art. _Pline_.\r\n\r\n[33] This, however, is not the fault of Pliny, but the result of\r\nimperfect tradition. To have described _every_ object _minutely_ that\r\nhe has named, and of which he has given the peculiar properties, would\r\nhave swollen his book to a most enormous size, almost indeed beyond\r\nconception.\r\n\r\n[34] Lemaire informs us, in his title-page, that the two first books of\r\nthe Natural History are edited by M. Alexandre, in his edition.\r\n\r\n[35] “Jucundissime;” it is not easy to find an epithet in our language\r\nwhich will correctly express the meaning of the original, affectionate\r\nand familiar, at the same time that it is sufficiently dignified and\r\nrespectful.\r\n\r\n[36] Lamb’s trans.; Carm. i. 4. of the original.\r\n\r\n[37] “Conterraneus;” we have no word in English which expresses the\r\nidea intended by the original, and which is, at the same time, a\r\nmilitary term. There is indeed some reason to doubt, whether the word\r\nnow inserted in the text was the one employed by the author: see\r\nthe remarks of M. Alexandre, in Lem. i. 3; also an observation in\r\nCigalino’s dissertation on the native country of Pliny; Valpy, 8.\r\n\r\n[38] “Permutatis prioribus sætabis;” Carm. xii. 14; xxv. 7; see the\r\nnotes in Lamb’s trans. pp. 135 & 149.\r\n\r\n[39] These names in the original are Varaniolus and Fabullus, which are\r\nsupposed to have been changed from Veranius and Fabius, as terms of\r\nfamiliarity and endearment; see Poinsinet, i. 24, and Lemaire, i. 4.\r\n\r\n[40] The narrative of Suetonius may serve to illustrate the observation\r\nof Pliny: “Triumphavit (Titus) cum patre, censuramque gessit una. Eidem\r\ncollega et in tribunicia potestate, et in septem consulatibus fuit.\r\nReceptaque ad se prope omnium officiorum cura, cum patris nomine et\r\nepistolas ipse dictaret, et edicta conscriberet, orationesque in Senatu\r\nrecitaret etiam quæstoris vice, præfecturam quoque prætorii suscepit,\r\nnunquam ad id tempus, nisi ab Equite Romano, administratum.” (viii. 5.)\r\n\r\n[41] “Perfricui faciem.” This appears to have been a proverbial\r\nexpression among the Romans; Cicero, Tusc. Quæs. iii. 41, employs “os\r\nperfricuisti,” and Martial, xi. 27. 7, “perfricuit frontem,” in the\r\nsame sense.\r\n\r\n[42] Suetonius speaks of Domitian’s taste for poetry, as a part of his\r\nhabitual dissimulation, viii. 2; see also the notes of Poinsinet, i.\r\n26, and of Alexandre, in Lemaire, i. 351.\r\n\r\n[43] “Non eras in hoc albo;” see the note of Alexandre, in Lemaire,\r\ni. 8. A passage in Quintilian, xii. 4, may serve to illustrate this\r\nuse of the term ‘album’; “... quorum alii se ad album ac rubricas\r\ntranstulerunt....”\r\n\r\n[44] It appears that the passage in which Cicero makes this quotation\r\nfrom Lucilius, is not in the part of his treatise De Republica which\r\nwas lately discovered by Angelus Maius; Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 9.\r\nCicero refers to this remark of Lucilius in two of his other works,\r\nalthough with a variation in the expression and in the individuals\r\nspecified; De Orat. ii. 6, and De Fin. i. 3.\r\n\r\n[45] “Qui primus condidit styli nasum.”\r\n\r\n[46] “Sed hæc ego mihi nunc patrocinia ademi nuncupatione.”\r\n\r\n[47] “Pecunias deponerent.” Ajasson, i. 11, remarks on these words,\r\n“Qui videri volebant ambitu alienissimi, pecuniam apud sanctum aliquem\r\nvirum deponebant, qua scilicet multarentur, si unquam hujus criminis\r\nmanifesti fierent.”\r\n\r\n[48] This expression is not found in any of the works of Cicero which\r\nare now extant, nor, indeed, is it certain that it was anything more\r\nthan a remark made in conversation.\r\n\r\n[49] “Provocatio,” calling forth.\r\n\r\n[50] Horace, Epist. ii. 1. 143; Ovid, Fast. iv. 746 and v. 121, and\r\nTibullus, i. 1. 26 and ii. 5. 37, refer to the offerings of milk made\r\nby the country people to their rural deities.\r\n\r\n[51] “... id est, artium et doctrinarum omnium circulus;” Alexandre in\r\nLem. i. 14.\r\n\r\n[52] These words are not found in any of the books of Livy now extant;\r\nwe may conclude that they were introduced into the latter part of his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[53] “Quem nunc primum historiæ Plinianæ librum vocamus, hic non\r\nnumeratur, quod sit operis index.” Hardouin in Lem. i. 16.\r\n\r\n[54] Nothing is known of Domitius Piso, either as an author or an\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n[55] The names of these authors will be found, arranged by Hardouin\r\nalphabetically, with a brief account of them and their works, in Lem.\r\ni. 157 _et seq._; we have nearly the same list in Valpy, p. 4903.\r\n\r\n[56] “Musinamur.” We learn from Hardouin, Lem. i. 17, that there is\r\nsome doubt as to the word employed by our author, whether it was\r\n_musinamur_ or _muginamur_; I should be disposed to adopt the former,\r\nas being, according to the remark of Turnebus, “verbum a Musis\r\ndeductum.”\r\n\r\n[57] “A fine Aufidii Bassi;” as Alexandre remarks, “Finis autem\r\nAufidii Bassi intelligendus est non mors ejus, sed tempus ad quod\r\nsuas ipse perduxerat historias. Quodnam illud ignoramus.” Lem. i. 18.\r\nFor an account of Aufidius Bassus we are referred to the catalogue of\r\nHardouin, but his name does not appear there. Quintilian (x. 1) informs\r\nus, that he wrote an account of the Germanic war.\r\n\r\n[58] “Jam pridem peracta sancitur.”\r\n\r\n[59] This sentiment is not found in that portion of the treatise which\r\nhas been lately published by Angelus Maius. Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 19.\r\n\r\n[60] The following is probably the passage in the Offices to which\r\nPliny refers: “Panæcius igitur, qui sine controversia de officiis\r\naccuratissime disputavit, quemque nos, correctione quadam exhibita,\r\npotissimum secuti sumus....” (iii. 2.)\r\n\r\n[61] “Cum præsertim sors fiat ex usura.” The commentators and\r\ntranslators have differed respecting the interpretation of this\r\npassage; I have given what appears to me the obvious meaning of the\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n[62] “Lac gallinaceum;” “Proverbium de re singulari et admodum rara,”\r\naccording to Hardouin, who quotes a parallel passage from Petronius;\r\nLemaire, i. 21.\r\n\r\n[63] The titles in the original are given in Greek; I have inserted in\r\nthe text the words which most nearly resemble them, and which have been\r\nemployed by modern authors.\r\n\r\n[64] “Lucubratio.”\r\n\r\n[65] The pun in the original cannot be preserved in the translation;\r\nthe English reader may conceive the name Bibaculus to correspond to our\r\nsurname Jolly.\r\n\r\n[66] “Sesculysses” and “Flextabula;” literally, Ulysses and a Half, and\r\nBend-table.\r\n\r\n[67] Βιβλιοθήκη.\r\n\r\n[68] “Cymbalum mundi” and “publicæ famæ tympanum.”\r\n\r\n[69] “Pendenti titulo;” as Hardouin explains it, “qui nondum absolutum\r\nopus significaret, verum adhuc pendere, velut imperfectum.” Lemaire, i.\r\n26.\r\n\r\n[70] “Homeromastigæ.”\r\n\r\n[71] “Dialectici.” By this term our author probably meant to\r\ndesignate those critics who were disposed to dwell upon minute verbal\r\ndistinctions; “dialecticarum captionum amantes,” according to Hardouin;\r\nLem. i. 28.\r\n\r\n[72] “Quod argutiarum amantissimi, et quod æmulatio inter illos\r\nacerbissima.” Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 28.\r\n\r\n[73] Pliny the younger, in one of his letters (iii. 5), where he\r\nenumerates all his uncle’s publications, informs us, that he wrote “a\r\npiece of criticism in eight books, concerning ambiguity of expression.”\r\nMelmoth’s Pliny, i. 136.\r\n\r\n[74] The ancients had very exaggerated notions respecting the period of\r\nthe elephant’s pregnancy; our author, in a subsequent part of his work\r\n(viii. 10), says, “Decem annis gestare vulgus existimat; Aristoteles\r\nbiennio.”\r\n\r\n[75] His real name was Tyrtamus, but in consequence of the beauty of\r\nhis style, he acquired the appellation by which he is generally known\r\nfrom the word θεῖος φράσις. Cicero on various occasions refers to him;\r\nBrutus, 121; Orator, 17, _et alibi_.\r\n\r\n[76] “Suspendio jam quærere mortem oportere homines vitæque renunciare,\r\ncum tantum licentiæ, vel feminæ, vel imperiti homines sumant, ut in\r\ndoctissimos scribant;” Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 29. We learn from\r\nCicero, De Nat. Deor. i. 33, that the name of this female was Leontium;\r\n“... sed meretricula etiam Leontium contra Theophrastum scribere ausa\r\nsit.”\r\n\r\n[77] A. Gellius (vii. 4) refers to this work and gives an extract from\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[78] The hostility which Cato bore to Scipio Africanus is mentioned by\r\nLivy, xxxviii. 54, and by Corn. Nepos, Cato, i.\r\n\r\n[79] Lucius Munatius Plancus took a conspicuous part in the political\r\nintrigues of the times and was especially noted for his follies and\r\nextravagance.\r\n\r\n[80] Asinius Pollio is a name which stands high in Roman literature;\r\naccording to the remark of Alexandre, “Vir magnus fuit, prono tamen\r\nad obtrectandum ingenio, quod arguunt ejus cum Cicerone simultates,”\r\nLemaire, i. 30. This hostile feeling towards Cicero is supposed to have\r\nproceeded from envy and mortification, because he was unable to attain\r\nthe same eminence in the art of oratory with his illustrious rival. See\r\nHardouin’s Index Auctorum, in Lemaire, i. 168.\r\n\r\n[81] “Vitiligatores.”\r\n\r\n[82] The table of contents, which occupies no less than 124 pages in\r\nLemaire’s edition, I have omitted, in consequence of its length; the\r\nobject which the author proposed to effect by the table of contents\r\nwill be gained more completely by an alphabetical index.\r\n\r\n[83] “Ἐποπτίδων.” For an account of Valerius Soranus see Hardouin’s\r\nIndex Auctorum, in Lemaire, i. 217.\r\n\r\n[84] To the end of each book of the Natural History is appended, in the\r\noriginal, a copious list of references to the sources from which the\r\nauthor derived his information. These are very numerous; in the second\r\nbook they amount to 45, in the third to 35, in the 4th to 53, in the\r\nfifth to 60, in the sixth to 54, and they are in the same proportion in\r\nthe remaining books.\r\n\r\n[85] “Spartum;” this plant was used to make bands for the vines and\r\ncables for ships.\r\n\r\n[86] “Mundus.” In translating from one language into another, it is\r\nproper, as a general principle, always to render the same word in the\r\noriginal by the same word in the translation. But to this rule there\r\nare two exceptions; where the languages do not possess words which\r\nprecisely correspond, and where the original author does not always\r\nuse the same word in the same sense. Both these circumstances, I\r\napprehend, apply to the case in question. The term _Mundus_ is used\r\nby Pliny, sometimes to mean _the earth_ and its immediate appendages,\r\nthe visible solar system; and at other times _the universe_; while\r\nI think we may venture to assert, that in some instances it is used\r\nin rather a vague manner, without any distinct reference to either\r\none or other of the above designations. I have, in almost all cases,\r\ntranslated it by the term _world_, as approaching nearest to the\r\nsense of the original. The word _mundus_ is frequently employed by\r\nLucretius, especially in his fifth book, and seems to be almost always\r\nused in the more extended sense of _universe_. There are, indeed, a\r\nfew passages where either meaning would be equally appropriate, and in\r\none line it would appear to be equivalent to _firmament_ or _heavens_;\r\n“et mundi speciem violare serenam,” iv. 138. Cicero, in his treatise\r\nDe Natura Deorum, generally uses the term _mundus_ in the sense of\r\n_universe_, as in ii. 22, 37, 58 and 154; while in one passage, ii.\r\n132, it would appear to be employed in the more limited sense of _the\r\nearth_. It occasionally occurs in the Fasti of Ovid, but it is not\r\neasy to ascertain its precise import; as in the line “Post chaos, ut\r\nprimum data sunt tria corpora mundo,” v. 41, where from the connexion\r\nit may be taken either in the more confined or in the more general\r\nsense. Manilius employs the word very frequently, and his commentators\r\nremark, that he uses it in two distinct senses, _the visible firmament_\r\nand the _universe_; and I am induced to think that he attaches still\r\nmore meaning to the term. It occurs three times in the first eleven\r\nlines of his poem. In the third line, “deducere mundo aggredior,”\r\n_mundus_ may be considered as equivalent to the celestial regions as\r\nopposed to the earth. In the ninth line, “concessumque patri mundo,”\r\nwe may consider it as signifying the celestial regions generally; and\r\nin the eleventh, “Jamque favet mundus,” the whole of the earth, or\r\nrather its inhabitants. We meet with it again in the sixty-eighth line,\r\n“lumina mundi,” where it seems more properly to signify the visible\r\nfirmament; again in the 139th, “Et mundi struxere globum,” it seems\r\nto refer especially to the earth, synonymous with the general sense\r\nof the English term _world_; while in the 153rd line, “per inania\r\nmundi,” it must be supposed to mean the universe. Hyginus, in his\r\nPoeticon Astronomicon, lib. i. p. 55, defines the term as follows:\r\n“Mundus appellatur is qui constat in sole et luna et terra et omnibus\r\nstellis;” and again, p. 57, “Terra mundi media regione collocata.” We\r\nmay observe the different designations of the term _mundus_ in Seneca;\r\namong other passages I may refer to his Nat. Quæst. vii. 27 & iii. 30;\r\nto his treatise De Consol. § 18 and De Benef. iv. 23, where I conceive\r\nthe precise meanings are, respectively, the universe, the terrestrial\r\nglobe, the firmament, and the heavenly bodies. The Greek term κόσμος,\r\nwhich corresponds to the Latin word _mundus_, was likewise employed to\r\nsignify, either the visible firmament or the universe. In illustration\r\nof this, it will be sufficient to refer to the treatise of Aristotle\r\nΠερὶ Κόσμου, cap. 2. p. 601. See also Stephens’s Thesaurus, _in loco_.\r\nIn Apuleius’s treatise De Mundo, which is a free translation of\r\nAristotle’s Περὶ Κόσμου, the term may be considered as synonymous with\r\nuniverse. It is used in the same sense in various parts of Apuleius’s\r\nwritings: see Metam. ii. 23; De Deo Socratis, 665, 667; De Dogmate\r\nPlatonis, 574, 575, _et alibi_.\r\n\r\n[87] Cicero, in his Timæus, uses the same phraseology; “Omne igitur\r\ncœlum, sive mundus, sive quovis alio vocabulo gaudet, hoc a nobis\r\nnuncupatum est,” § 2. Pomponius Mela’s work commences with a similar\r\nexpression; “Omne igitur hoc, quidquid est, cui mundi cœlique nomen\r\nindideris, unum id est.” They were probably taken from a passage in\r\nPlato’s Timæus, “Universum igitur hoc, Cœlum, sive Mundum, sive quo\r\nalio vocabulo gaudet, cognominemus,” according to the translation of\r\nFicinus; Platonis Op. ix. p. 302. The word _cœlum_, which is employed\r\nin the original, in its ordinary acceptation, signifies _the heavens_,\r\nthe visible firmament; as in Ovid, Met. i. 5, “quod tegit omnia,\r\ncœlum.” It is, in most cases, employed in this sense by Lucretius and\r\nby Manilius, as in i. 2. of the former and in i. 14. of the latter.\r\nOccasionally, however, it is employed by both of these writers in the\r\nmore general sense of _celestial regions_, in opposition to the earth,\r\nas by Lucretius, i. 65, and by Manilius, i. 352. In the line quoted\r\nby Cicero from Pacuvius, it would seem to mean the place in which the\r\nplanets are situated; De Nat. Deor. ii. 91. The Greek word οὐρανὸς may\r\nbe regarded as exactly corresponding to the Latin word _cœlum_, and\r\nemployed with the same modifications; see Aristotle, De Mundo and De\r\nCœlo, and Ptolemy, Mag. Const. lib. i. _passim_; see also Stephens’s\r\nThesaurus, _in loco_. Aratus generally uses it to designate the visible\r\nfirmament, as in l. 10, while in l. 32 it means the heavenly regions.\r\nGesner defines _cœlum_, “Mundus exclusa terra,” and _mundus_, “Cœlum et\r\nquidquid cœli ambitu continetur.” In the passage from Plato, referred\r\nto above, the words which are translated by Ficinus _cœlum_ and\r\n_mundus_, are in the original οὐρανὸς and κόσμος; Ficinus, however, in\r\nvarious parts of the Timæus, translates οὐρανὸς by the word _mundus_:\r\nsee t. ix. p. 306, 311, _et alibi_.\r\n\r\n[88] The following passage from Cicero may serve to illustrate the\r\ndoctrine of Pliny: “Novem tibi orbibus, vel potius globis, connexa\r\nsunt omnia: quorum unus est cœlestis, extimus, qui reliquos omnes\r\ncomplectitur, summus ipse Deus, arcens et continens cœlum;” Som. Scip.\r\n§ 4. I may remark, however, that the term here employed by our author\r\nis not _Deus_ but _Numen_.\r\n\r\n[89] We have an interesting account of the opinions of Aristotle on\r\nthis subject, in a note in M. Ajasson’s translation, ii. 234 _et seq._,\r\nwhich, as well as the greater part of the notes attached to the second\r\nbook of the Natural History, were written by himself in conjunction\r\nwith M. Marcus.\r\n\r\n[90] The philosophers of antiquity were divided in their opinions\r\nrespecting the great question, whether the active properties of\r\nmaterial bodies, which produce the phænomena of nature, are inherent\r\nin them, and necessarily attached to them, or whether they are\r\nbestowed upon them by some superior power or being. The Academics and\r\nPeripatetics generally adopted the latter opinion, the Stoics the\r\nformer: Pliny adopts the doctrine of the Stoics; see Enfield’s Hist. of\r\nPhil. i. 229, 283, 331.\r\n\r\n[91] I may remark, that the astronomy of our author is, for the most\r\npart, derived from Aristotle; the few points in which they differ will\r\nbe stated in the appropriate places.\r\n\r\n[92] This doctrine was maintained by Plato in his Timæus, p. 310,\r\nand adopted by Aristotle, De Cœlo, lib. ii. cap. 14, and by Cicero,\r\nDe Nat. Deor. ii. 47. The spherical form of the world, οὐρανὸς, and\r\nits circular motion are insisted upon by Ptolemy, in the commencement\r\nof his astronomical treatise Μεγάλη Σύνταξις, Magna Constructio,\r\nfrequently referred to by its Arabic title Almagestum, cap. 2. He is\r\nsupposed to have made his observations at Alexandria, between the years\r\n125 and 140 A.D. His great astronomical work was translated into Arabic\r\nin the year 827; the original Greek text was first printed in 1538 by\r\nGrynæus, with a commentary by Theon. George of Trebisond published a\r\nLatin version of it in 1541, and a second was published by Camerarius\r\nin 1551, along with Ptolemy’s other works. John Muller, usually called\r\nRegiomontanus, and Purback published an abridgement of the Almagest in\r\n1541. For an account of Ptolemy I may refer to the article in the Biog.\r\nUniv. xxxv. 263 _et seq._, by Delambre, also to Hutton’s Math. Dict.,\r\n_in loco_, and to the high character of him by Whewell, Hist. of the\r\nInductive Sciences, p. 214.\r\n\r\n[93] See Ptolemy, _ubi supra_.\r\n\r\n[94] This opinion, which was maintained by Pythagoras, is noticed and\r\nderided by Aristotle, De Cœlo, lib. ii. cap. 9. p. 462-3. A brief\r\naccount of Pythagoras’s doctrine on this subject is contained in\r\nEnfield’s Philosophy, i. 386.\r\n\r\n[95] Pliny probably here refers to the opinion which Cicero puts into\r\nthe mouth of one of the interlocutors in his treatise De Nat. Deor.\r\nii. 47, “Quid enim pulchrius ea figura, quæ sola omnes alias figuras\r\ncomplexa continet, quæque nihil asperitatis habere, nihil offensionis\r\npotest, nihil incisum angulis, nihil anfractibus, nihil eminens, nihil\r\nlacunosum?”\r\n\r\n[96] The letter Δ, in the constellation of the triangle; it is named\r\nΔελτωτὸν by Aratus, l. 235; also by Manilius, i. 360. We may remark,\r\nthat, except in this one case, the constellations have no visible\r\nresemblance to the objects of which they bear the name.\r\n\r\n[97] “Locum hunc Plinii de Galaxia, sive Lactea via, interpretantur\r\nomnes docti.” Alexandre, in Lemaire, i. 227. It may be remarked, that\r\nthe word _vertex_ is here used in the sense of the astronomical term\r\nzenith, not to signify the pole.\r\n\r\n[98] De Ling. Lat. lib. iv. p. 7, 8. See also the remarks on the\r\nderivation of the word in Gesner, Thes., _in loco_.\r\n\r\n[99] “Signifer.” The English term is taken from the Greek word\r\nΖωδιακὸς, derived from Ζῶον; see Aristotle, De Mundo, cap. 2. p. 602.\r\nThe word _Zodiacus_ does not occur in Pliny, nor is it employed by\r\nPtolemy; he names it λοξὸς κύκλος, _obliquus circulus_; Magn. Const.\r\ni. 7, 13, _et alibi_. It is used by Cicero, but professedly as a Greek\r\nterm; Divin. ii. 89, and Arati Phænom. l. 317. It occurs in Hyginus,\r\np. 57 _et alibi_, and in A. Gellius, 13. 9. Neither _signifer_ taken\r\nsubstantively, nor _zodiacus_ occur in Lucretius or in Manilius.\r\n\r\n[100] The account of the elements, of their nature, difference, and,\r\nmore especially, the necessity of their being four, are fully discussed\r\nby Aristotle in various parts of his works, more particularly in his\r\ntreatise De Cœlo, lib. iii. cap. 3, 4 and 5, lib. iv. cap. 5, and De\r\nGener. et Cor. lib. ii. cap. 2, 3, 4 and 5. For a judicious summary of\r\nthe opinions of Aristotle on this subject, I may refer to Stanley’s\r\nHistory of Philosophy; Aristotle, doctrines of, p. 2. l. 7, and to\r\nEnfield, i. 764 _et seq._ For the Epicurean doctrine, see Lucretius, i.\r\n764 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[101] Although the word _planeta_, as taken from the Greek πλανήτης, is\r\ninserted in the title of this chapter, it does not occur in any part\r\nof the text. It is not found either in Lucretius, Manilius, or Seneca,\r\nnor, I believe, was it used by any of their contemporaries, except\r\nHyginus, p. 76. The planets were generally styled _stellæ erraticæ_,\r\n_errantes_, or _vagæ_, _sidera palantia_, as in Lucretius, ii. 1030,\r\nor simply the _five stars_, as in Cicero, De Nat. Deor. ii. 51, and\r\nin Seneca, Nat. Quæst. vii. 24. Pliny, by including the sun and moon,\r\nmakes the number seven. Aratus calls them πέντ’ ἄστερες, l. 454.\r\n\r\n[102] “Aër.” “Circumfusa undique est (terra) hac animabili spirabilique\r\nnatura, cui nomen est aër; Græcum illud quidem, sed perceptum jam tamen\r\nusu a nobis;” Cicero, De Nat. Deor. ii. 91.\r\n\r\n[103] “universi cardine.” “Revolutionis, ut aiunt, centro. Idem\r\nPlinius, hoc ipso libro, cap. 64, terram cœli cardinem esse dicit;”\r\nAlexandre, in Lem. i. 228. On this subject I may refer to Ptolemy,\r\nMagn. Const, lib. i. cap. 3, 4, 6. See also Apuleius, near the\r\ncommencement of his treatise De Mundo.\r\n\r\n[104] “Sidera.” The word _sidus_ is used, in most cases, for one of the\r\nheavenly bodies generally, sometimes for what we term a constellation,\r\na particular assemblage of them, and sometimes specially for an\r\nindividual star. Manilius employs the word in all these senses, as will\r\nappear by the three following passages respectively; the first taken\r\nfrom the opening of his poem,\r\n\r\n  “Carmine divinas artes, et conscia fati\r\n  Sidera....”\r\n\r\nThe second,\r\n\r\n  “Hæc igitur texunt æquali sidera tractu\r\n  Ignibus in varias cœlum laqueantia formas.” i. 275, 276.\r\n\r\nThe third\r\n\r\n  “... pectus, fulgenti sidere clarius;” i. 356.\r\n\r\nIn the Fasti of Ovid, we have examples of the two latter of these\r\nsignifications:—\r\n\r\n  “Ex Ariadnæo sidere nosse potes;” v. 316.\r\n\r\n  “Et canis (Icarium dicunt) quo sidere noto\r\n  Tosta sitit tellus;” iv. 939, 940.\r\n\r\nLucretius appears always to employ the term in the general sense. J.\r\nObsequens applies the word _sidus_ to a meteor; “sidus ingens cœlo\r\ndemissum,” cap. 16. In a subsequent part of this book, chap. 18 _et\r\nseq._, our author more particularly restricts the term _sidus_ to the\r\nplanets.\r\n\r\n[105] Cicero remarks concerning them; “quæ (stellæ) falso vocantur\r\nerrantes;” De Nat. Deor. ii. 51.\r\n\r\n[106] “... vices dierum alternat et noctium, quum sidera præsens\r\noccultat, illustrat absens;” Hard. in Lem. i. 230.\r\n\r\n[107] “ceteris sideribus.” According to Hardouin, _ubi supra_, “nimium\r\nstellis errantibus.” There is, however, nothing in the expression of\r\nour author which sanctions this limitation.\r\n\r\n[108] See Iliad, iii. 277, and Od. xii. 323.\r\n\r\n[109] It is remarked by Enfield, Hist. of Phil. ii. 131, that “with\r\nrespect to philosophical opinions, Pliny did not rigidly adhere to any\r\nsect.... He reprobates the Epicurean tenet of an infinity of worlds;\r\nfavours the Pythagorean notion of the harmony of the spheres; speaks\r\nof the universe as God, after the manner of the Stoics, and sometimes\r\nseems to pass over into the field of the Sceptics. For the most part,\r\nhowever, he leans to the doctrine of Epicurus.”\r\n\r\n[110] “Si alius est Deus quam sol,” Alexandre in Lem. i. 230. Or\r\nrather, if there be any God distinct from the world; for the latter\r\npart of the sentence can scarcely apply to the sun. Poinsinet and\r\nAjasson, however, adopt the same opinion with M. Alexandre; they\r\ntranslate the passage, “s’il en est autre que le soleil,” i. 17 and ii.\r\n11.\r\n\r\n[111] “totus animæ, totus animi;” “Anima est qua vivimus, animus quo\r\nsapimus.” Hard. in Lem. i. 230, 231. The distinction between these two\r\nwords is accurately pointed out by Lucretius, iii. 137 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[112] “fecerunt (Athenienses) Contumeliæ fanum et Impudentiæ.” Cicero,\r\nDe Leg. ii. 28. See also Bossuet, Discours sur l’Histoire univ. i. 250.\r\n\r\n[113] The account which Cicero gives us of the opinions of Democritus\r\nscarcely agrees with the statement in the text; see De Nat. Deor. i.\r\n120.\r\n\r\n[114] “In varios divisit Deos numen unicum, quod Plinio cœlum est aut\r\nmundus; ejusque singulas partes, aut, ut philosophi aiunt, attributa,\r\nseparatim coluit;” Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 231.\r\n\r\n[115] “Febrem autem ad minus nocendum, templis celebrant, quorum adhuc\r\nunum in Palatio....” Val. Max. ii. 6; see also Ælian, Var. Hist. xii.\r\n11. It is not easy to ascertain the precise meaning of the terms\r\n_Fanum_, _Ædes_, and _Templum_, which are employed in this place by\r\nPliny and Val. Maximus. Gesner defines _Fanum_ “area templi et solium,\r\n_templum_ vero ædificium;” but this distinction, as he informs us,\r\nis not always accurately observed; there appears to be still less\r\ndistinction between _Ædes_ and _Templum_; see his Thesaurus _in loco_,\r\nalso Bailey’s Facciolati _in loco_.\r\n\r\n[116] “Orbona est Orbitalis dea.” Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 231.\r\n\r\n[117] “Appositos sibi statim ab ortu custodes credebant, quos viri\r\nGenios, Junones fœminæ vocabant.” Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 232. See\r\nTibullus, 4. 6. 1, and Seneca, Epist. 110, _sub init._\r\n\r\n[118] We may suppose that our author here refers to the popular\r\nmythology of the Egyptians; the “fœtidi cibi” are mentioned by Juvenal;\r\n“Porrum et cæpe nefas violare et frangere morsu,” xv. 9; and Pliny, in\r\na subsequent part of his work, xix. 32, remarks, “Allium cæpeque inter\r\nDeos in jurejurando habet Ægyptus.”\r\n\r\n[119] See Cicero, De Nat. Deor. i. 42 _et alibi_, for an illustration\r\nof these remarks of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[120] This sentiment is elegantly expressed by Cicero, De Nat. Deor.\r\nii. 62, and by Horace, Od. iii. 3. 9 _et seq._ It does not appear,\r\nhowever, that any of the Romans, except Romulus, were deified, previous\r\nto the adulatory period of the Empire.\r\n\r\n[121] “Planetarum nempe, qui omnes nomina mutuantur a diis.” Alexandre\r\nin Lemaire, i. 234.\r\n\r\n[122] This remark may be illustrated by the following passage from\r\nCicero, in the first book of his treatise De Nat. Deor. Speaking of\r\nthe doctrine of Zeno, he says, “neque enim Jovem, neque Junonem, neque\r\nVestam, neque quemquam, qui ita appelletur, in deorum habet numero:\r\nsed rebus inanimis, atque mutis, per quandam significationem, hæc docet\r\ntributa nomina.” “Idemque (Chrysippus) disputat, æthera esse eum,\r\nquem homines Jovem appellant: quique aër per maria manaret, eum esse\r\nNeptunum: terramque eam esse, quæ Ceres diceretur: similique ratione\r\npersequitur vocabula reliquorum deorum.”\r\n\r\n[123] The following remarks of Lucretius and of Cicero may serve to\r\nillustrate the opinion here expressed by our author:—\r\n\r\n“Omnis enim per se Divum natura necesse est Immortali ævo summa cum\r\npace fruatur, Semota ab nostris rebus, sejunctaque longe;” Lucretius,\r\ni. 57-59.\r\n\r\n“Quod æternum beatumque sit, id nec habere ipsum negotii quidquam, nec\r\nexhibere alteri; itaque neque ira neque gratia teneri, quod, quæ talia\r\nessent, imbecilla essent omnia.” Cicero, De Nat. Deor. i. 45.\r\n\r\n[124] The author here alludes to the figures of the Egyptian deities\r\nthat were engraven on rings.\r\n\r\n[125] His specific office was to execute vengeance on the impious.\r\n\r\n[126] “sola utramque paginam facit.” The words _utraque pagina_\r\ngenerally refer to the two sides of the same sheet, but, in this\r\npassage, they probably mean the contiguous portions of the same surface.\r\n\r\n[127] “astroque suo eventu assignat;” the word _astrum_ appears to\r\nbe synonymous with _sidus_, generally signifying a single star, and,\r\noccasionally, a constellation; as in Manilius, i. 541, 2.\r\n\r\n  “... quantis bis sena ferantur\r\n  Finibus astra....”\r\n\r\nIt is also used by synecdoche for the heavens, as is the case with the\r\nEnglish word _stars_. See Gesner’s Thesaurus.\r\n\r\n[128] “Quæ si suscipiamus, pedis offensio nobis ... et sternutamenta\r\nerunt observanda.” Cicero, De Nat. Deor. ii. 84.\r\n\r\n[129] “Divus Augustus.” The epithet _divus_ may be regarded as merely\r\na term of court etiquette, because all the Emperors after death were\r\ndeified _ex officio_.\r\n\r\n[130] We learn the exact nature of this ominous accident from\r\nSuetonius; “... si mane sibi calceus perperam, et sinister pro dextro\r\ninduceretur;” Augustus, Cap. 92. From this passage it would appear,\r\nthat the Roman sandals were made, as we term it, right and left.\r\n\r\n[131] It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the opinions here\r\nstated respecting the Deity are taken partly from the tenets of the\r\nEpicureans, combined with the Stoical doctrine of Fate. The examples\r\nwhich are adduced to prove the power of fate over the Deity are, for\r\nthe most part, rather verbal than essential.\r\n\r\n[132] “affixa mundo.” The peculiar use of the word _mundus_ in this\r\npassage is worthy of remark, in connexion with note [86], ch. 1.\r\npage 13.\r\n\r\n[133] We have many references in Pliny to the influence of the\r\nstars upon the earth and its inhabitants, constituting what was\r\nformerly regarded as so important a science, judicial astrology.\r\nPtolemy has drawn up a regular code of it in his “Centum dicta,” or\r\n“Centiloquiums.” We have a highly interesting account of the supposed\r\nscience, its origin, progress, and general principles, in Whewell’s\r\nHistory of the Inductive Sciences, p. 293 _et seq._ I may also refer to\r\nthe same work for a sketch of the history of astronomy among the Greeks\r\nand the other nations of antiquity.\r\n\r\n[134] There are certain metaphorical expressions, which have originated\r\nfrom this opinion, adopted by the moderns; “his star is set;” “the star\r\nof his fortune,” &c.\r\n\r\n[135] Ovid, when he compares Phaëton to a falling star, remarks,\r\nconcerning this meteor,—\r\n\r\n  “Etsi non cecidit, potuit cecidisse videri.” Metam. ii. 322.\r\n\r\n[136] Manilius supposes that comets are produced and rendered luminous\r\nby an operation very similar to the one described in the text; i. 815\r\n_et seq._ Seneca, in the commencement of his Nat. Quæst., and in other\r\nparts of the same treatise, refers to this subject. His remarks may be\r\nworth perusing by those who are curious to learn the hypotheses of the\r\nancients on subjects of natural science. We may remark, that Seneca’s\r\nopinions are, on many points, more correct than our author’s.\r\n\r\n[137] The author probably refers to that part of his work in which he\r\ntreats on agriculture, particularly to the 17th and 18th books.\r\n\r\n[138] The æra of the Olympiads commenced in the year 776 before\r\nChrist; each olympiad consists of 4 years; the 58th olympiad will\r\ntherefore include the interval 548 to 544 B.C. The 21st vol. of the\r\n“Universal History” consists entirely of a “chronological table,” and\r\nwe have a useful table of the same kind in Brewster’s Encycl., article\r\n“Chronology.”\r\n\r\n[139] “rerum fores aperuisse ... traditur.” An account of the astronomy\r\nof Anaximander is contained in Brewster’s Encycl., article “Astronomy,”\r\np. 587, and in the article “Anaximander” in the supplement to the same\r\nwork by Scott of Aberdeen. I may remark, that these two accounts do\r\nnot quite agree in their estimate of his merits; the latter author\r\nconsiders his opinions more correct. We have also an account of\r\nAnaximander in Stanley, pt. 2. p. 1 _et seq._, and in Enfield, i. 154\r\n_et seq._\r\n\r\n[140] In the translation of Ajasson, ii. 261-7, we have some valuable\r\nobservations by Marcus, respecting the origin and progress of astronomy\r\namong the Greeks, and the share which the individuals mentioned in the\r\ntext respectively had in its advancement; also some interesting remarks\r\non the history of Atlas. Diodorus Siculus says, that “he was the first\r\nthat discovered the knowledge of the sphere; whence arose the common\r\nopinion, that he carried the world upon his shoulders.” Booth’s trans.\r\np. 115.\r\n\r\n[141] “nunc relicto mundi ipsius corpore, reliqua inter cœlum terrasque\r\ntractentur.” I have already had occasion to remark upon the various\r\nmodes in which the author uses the word _mundus_; by _cœlum_, in\r\nthis passage, he means the body or region beyond the planets, which\r\nis conceived to contain the fixed stars. _Sphæra_, in the preceding\r\nsentence, may be supposed to mean the celestial globe.\r\n\r\n[142] “ac trigesimo anno ad brevissima sedis suæ principia regredi;” I\r\nconfess myself unable to offer any literal explanation of this passage;\r\nnor do the remarks of the commentators appear to me satisfactory; see\r\nHardouin and Alexandre in Lemaire, ii. 241, 2. It is translated by\r\nAjasson “en trente ans il reviens à l’espace minime d’où il est parti.”\r\nThe period of the sidereal revolutions of the planets, as stated by\r\nMrs. Somerville, in her “Mechanism of the Heavens,” and by Sir J.\r\nHerschel, in his “Treatise on Astronomy,” are respectively as follows:—\r\n\r\n                days.            days.\r\n  Mercury      87·9705         87·9692580\r\n  Venus       224·7           224·7007869\r\n  Earth       365·2564        365·2563612\r\n  Mars        686·99          686·9796458\r\n  Jupiter    4332·65         4332·5848212\r\n  Saturn    10759·4         10759·2198174\r\n\r\n  Somerville, p. 358.       Herschel, p. 416.\r\n\r\n[143] “‘mundo;’ hoc est, cœlo inerrantium stellarum.” Hardouin, in\r\nLemaire, ii. 242.\r\n\r\n[144] Our author supposes, that the spectator has his face directed\r\ntowards the south, as is the case with the modern observers. We are,\r\nhowever, informed by Hardouin, that this was not the uniform practice\r\namong the ancients; see the remarks of Alexandre in Lemaire, ii. 242,\r\nand of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 269.\r\n\r\n[145] The _constant revolution_ refers to the apparent daily\r\nmotion; the _opposite direction_ to their annual course through the\r\nzodiac. Ptolemy gives an account of this double motion in his Magna\r\nConstructio, i. 7.\r\n\r\n[146] For the exact period, according to Somerville and Herschel, see\r\nnote [142], p. 27.\r\n\r\n[147] Aristotle informs us, that Mars was also called Hercules or\r\nPyrosis; De Mundo, cap. ii. p. 602. See also Apuleius, De Mundo, § 710.\r\nHyginus is said by Hardouin to give the name of Hercules to the planet\r\nMars, but this appears to be an inaccuracy; he describes the planet\r\nunder its ordinary appellation; lib. ii. p. 62; and ii. 78, 9.\r\n\r\n[148] Cicero, speaking of the period of Mars, says, “Quatuor et viginti\r\nmensibus, sex, ut opinor, diebus minus;” De Nat. Deor. For the exact\r\nperiod, see note [142], p. 27.\r\n\r\n[149] “Sed ut observatio umbrarum ejus redeat ad notas.” According to\r\nthe interpretation of Hardouin, “Ad easdem lineas in solari horologio.”\r\nLemaire, ii. 243.\r\n\r\n[150] This is an example of the mode of computation which we meet with\r\namong the ancients, where, in speaking of the period of a revolution,\r\nboth the time preceding and that following the interval are included.\r\n\r\n[151] The division of the planets into superior and inferior was not\r\nknown to Aristotle, De Mundo, cap. ii. p. 602, to Plato, Timæus, p.\r\n318, 319, or the older Greek astronomers. It was first made by the\r\nEgyptians, and was transferred from them to the Romans. It is one of\r\nthe points in which our author differs from Aristotle. See the remarks\r\nof Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 242 _et seq._ Marcus notices the various\r\npoints which prove the deficiency of Pliny’s knowledge of astronomy; he\r\nparticularizes the four following:—his ignorance of the true situation\r\nof the constellations; his erroneous opinion respecting the cause of\r\nthe seasons; his account of the phases of the moon, and of the position\r\nof the cardinal points. He appears not to have been aware, that certain\r\nastronomical phænomena undergo a regular progression, but supposed that\r\nthey remained, at the time when he wrote, in the same state as in the\r\nage of Hipparchus or the original observers. Columella, when treating\r\non these subjects, describes the phænomena according to the ancient\r\ncalculation, but he informs us, that he adopts it, because it was the\r\none in popular use, and better known by the farmers (De Re Rust. ix.\r\n14), while Pliny appears not to have been aware of the inaccuracy.\r\n\r\n[152] “Modo solem antegrediens, modo subsequens.” Hardouin in Lemaire,\r\nii. 243.\r\n\r\n[153] It was not known to the earlier writers that Lucifer and Vesper\r\nwere the same star, differently situated with respect to the Sun.\r\nPlayfair remarks, that Venus is the only planet mentioned in the sacred\r\nwritings, and in the most ancient poets, such as Hesiod and Homer;\r\nOutlines, ii. 156.\r\n\r\n[154] There has been much discussion among the commentators respecting\r\nthe correctness of the figures in the text; according to the æra of the\r\nolympiads, the date referred to will be between the years 750 and 754\r\nB.C.; the foundation of Rome is commonly referred to the year 753 B.C.\r\nSee the remarks of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 278, 9.\r\n\r\n[155] Aristotle informs us, that it was called either Phosphorus, Juno,\r\nor Venus; De Mundo, cap. 2. t. i. p. 602. See also Hyginus, Poet. Astr.\r\nlib. iii. p. 76, 7; and Apuleius, De Mundo, § 710.\r\n\r\n[156] It will be scarcely necessary to refer the reader to the\r\nwell-known commencement of Lucretius’s poem for the illustration of\r\nthis passage; it is remarkable that Pliny does not refer to this writer.\r\n\r\n[157] The periodical revolution of Venus is 224·7 days, see note\r\n[142], p. 27. Its greatest elongation is 47° 1′; Somerville, § 641.\r\np. 391.\r\n\r\n[158] According to Aristotle, this planet had the three appellations\r\nof Stilbon, Mercury, and Apollo; De Mundo, cap. 2. p. 602; see also\r\nApuleius, De Mundo, § 710. Cicero inverts the order of the planets;\r\nhe places Mercury next to Mars, and says of Venus, that it is “infima\r\nquinque errantium, terræque proxima;” De Nat. Deor. ii. 53. Aristotle\r\nplaces the stars in the same order, _ubi supra_, and he is followed in\r\nthis by Apuleius, _ubi supra_; this appears to have been the case with\r\nthe Stoics generally; see Enfield’s Phil. i. 339.\r\n\r\n[159] For the periodical revolution of Mercury see note[142], p. 27.\r\nIts greatest elongation, according to Playfair, p. 160, is 28°. Mrs.\r\nSomerville, p. 386, states it to be 28° 8′. Ptolemy supposed it to be\r\n26·5 degrees; Almagest, ix. 7. We learn from Hardouin, Lemaire, i. 246,\r\nthat there is considerable variation in the MSS. with respect to the\r\ngreatest elongation of Mercury.\r\n\r\n[160] Sosigenes was an Egyptian mathematician and astronomer, who is\r\nsaid to have assisted Cæsar in the formation of his Kalendar, as our\r\nauthor informs us in a subsequent part of his work, xviii. 25; see also\r\nAikin, Gen. Biog., _in loco_; Enfield’s Phil. ii. 96; Whewell, p. 210;\r\nand Hardouin’s “Index Auctorum,” in Lemaire, i. 213.\r\n\r\n[161] Concerning the “magnus annus” Cicero remarks, “efficitur cum\r\nsolis et lunæ et quinque errantium ad eandem inter se comparationem,\r\nconfectis omnibus spatiis, est facta conversio.” De Nat. Deor. ii. 51.\r\nSee the remarks of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 281-3.\r\n\r\n[162] For the various appellations which the moon has received in the\r\nancient and modern languages, and their relation to each other, the\r\nreader is referred to the learned remarks of Marcus in Ajasson, ii.\r\n283-5.\r\n\r\n[163] Marcus conceives that the epithet _maculosa_ does not refer to\r\nwhat are called the spots on the moon, but to the circumstance of\r\nthe edge of the disc being not illuminated when it is near the full;\r\nAjasson, ii. 286. But, from the way in which the word is employed at\r\nthe end of the chapter, and from the explanation which is given of the\r\ncause of the “maculæ,” I think it ought to be referred to the spotted\r\nappearance of the face of the moon.\r\n\r\n[164] “Quum laborare non creditur.” It was a vulgar notion among the\r\nancients, that when the moon is eclipsed, she is suffering from the\r\ninfluence of magicians and enchanters, who are endeavouring to draw\r\nher down to the earth, in order to aid them in their superstitious\r\nceremonies. It was conceived that she might be relieved from her\r\nsufferings by loud noises of various kinds which should drown the songs\r\nof the magicians. Allusion is frequently made to this custom by the\r\nancient poets, as Virgil, Æn. i. 742, Manilius, i. 227, and Juvenal,\r\nvi. 444; and the language has been transferred to the moderns, as in\r\nBeattie’s Minstrel, ii. 47, “To ease of fancied pangs the labouring\r\nmoon.”\r\n\r\n[165] We have some interesting remarks by Marcus respecting Endymion,\r\nand also on the share which Solon and Thales had in correcting the\r\nlunar observations; Ajasson, ii. 288-290.\r\n\r\n[166] “Lucem nobis aperuere in hac luce.”\r\n\r\n[167] “Cardo.”\r\n\r\n[168] Astronomers describe two different revolutions or periods of the\r\nmoon; the synodical and the sidereal. The synodical marks the time in\r\nwhich the moon passes from one conjunction with the sun to the next\r\nconjunction, or other similar position with respect to the sun. The\r\nsidereal period is the time in which the moon returns to the same\r\nposition with respect to the stars, or in which it makes a complete\r\nrevolution round the earth. These numbers are, for the synodical\r\nperiod, 29ᵈ 12ʰ 44ᵐ 2·87ˢ, and for the sidereal, 27ᵈ 7ʰ 43ᵐ 11·5ˢ;\r\nHerschel, pp. 213, 224.\r\n\r\n[169] Our author, as Marcus remarks, “a compté par nombres ronds;”\r\nAjasson, ii. 291; the correct number may be found in the preceding note.\r\n\r\n[170] It was a general opinion among the ancients, and one which\r\nwas entertained until lately by many of the moderns, that the moon\r\npossessed the power of evaporating the water of the ocean. This opinion\r\nappears to have been derived, at least in part, from the effect which\r\nthe moon produces on the tides.\r\n\r\n[171] “quantum ex sole ipsa concipiat;” from this passage, taken\r\nsingly, it might be concluded, that the author supposed the quantity\r\nof light received by the moon to differ at different times; but the\r\nsucceeding sentence seems to prove that this is not the case; see the\r\nremarks of Alexandre in Lemaire, ii. 249. Marcus, however, takes a\r\ndifferent view of the subject; Ajasson, ii. 291, 292. He had previously\r\npointed out Pliny’s opinion respecting the phases of the moon, as one\r\nof the circumstances which indicate his ignorance of astronomy, _ut\r\nsupra_, ii. 245, 246.\r\n\r\n[172] This doctrine is maintained by Seneca, Quæst. Nat. lib. ii. §\r\n5. p. 701, 702. From the allusion which is made to it by Anacreon, in\r\nhis 19th ode, we may presume that it was the current opinion among the\r\nancients.\r\n\r\n[173] I may remark, that Poinsinet, in this passage, substitutes\r\n“umbra” for “umbræque,” contrary to the authority of all the MSS.,\r\nmerely because it accords better with his ideas of correct reasoning.\r\nAlthough it may be of little consequence in this particular sentence,\r\nyet, as such liberties are not unfrequently taken, I think it\r\nnecessary to state my opinion, that this mode of proceeding is never\r\nto be admitted, and that it has proved a source of serious injury to\r\nclassical literature. In this account of the astronomical phenomena,\r\nas well as in all the other scientific dissertations that occur in\r\nour author, my aim has been to transfer into our language the exact\r\nsense of the original, without addition or correction. Our object in\r\nreading Pliny is not to acquire a knowledge of natural philosophy,\r\nwhich might be better learned from the commonest elementary work of the\r\npresent day, but to ascertain what were the opinions of the learned\r\non such subjects when Pliny wrote. I make this remark, because I have\r\nseldom if ever perused a translation of any classical author, where, on\r\nscientific topics, the translator has not endeavoured, more or less, to\r\ncorrect the mistakes of the original, and to adapt his translation to\r\nthe state of modern science.\r\n\r\n[174] The terms here employed are respectively _interventus_,\r\n_objectio_, and _interpositus_; it may be doubted whether the author\r\nintended to employ them in the precise sense which is indicated by\r\ntheir etymology.\r\n\r\n[175] “metæ et turbini inverso.” The _metæ_ were small pyramids placed\r\nat the two extremities of the spina, or central division of the circus:\r\nsee Montfaucon, v. iii. p. 176; Adam, p. 341.\r\n\r\n[176] The eclipses of the moon are only visible when the spectator is\r\nso situated as to be able to observe the shadow of the earth, or is on\r\nthat side of the earth which is turned from the sun.\r\n\r\n[177] “non semper in scrupulis partium congruente siderum motu.” On\r\nthe term _scrupulus_ Hardouin remarks, “Scrupuli, nodi sunt, in quibus\r\ncirculi, quos in suo cursu Sol et Luna efficiunt, se mutuo secant.”\r\nLemaire, ii. 251. Ptolemy, Magn. Const. vi. 6-11, gives a full and\r\ngenerally correct account of the principal phænomena of eclipses.\r\n\r\n[178] Marcus conceives that our author must here mean, not the actual,\r\nbut the apparent size of these bodies; Ajasson, ii. 295; but I do not\r\nperceive that the text authorizes this interpretation.\r\n\r\n[179] I have given the simple translation of the original as it\r\nnow stands in the MSS.; whether these may have been corrupted, or\r\nthe author reasoned incorrectly, I do not venture to decide. The\r\ncommentators have, according to their usual custom, proposed various\r\nemendations and explanations, for which I may refer to the note of\r\nHardouin in Lemaire, ii. 252, with the judicious remarks of Alexandre,\r\nand to those of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 295-298, who appear to me to\r\ntake a correct view of the subject.\r\n\r\n[180] Alexandre remarks, “Hinc tamen potius distantia quam magnitudo\r\nSolis colligi potest.” Lemaire, ii. 252. And the same remark applies to\r\nthe two next positions of our author.\r\n\r\n[181] Alexandre remarks on the argument of our author, perhaps a little\r\ntoo severely, “Absurde dictum; nam aliis oritur, aliis occidit, dum\r\naliis est a vertice; quod vel pueri sentiunt.” Lemaire, ii. 253. But\r\nwe may suppose, that Pliny, in this passage, only meant to say, that\r\nas the sun became vertical to each successive part of the equinoctial\r\ndistrict, no shadows were formed in it.\r\n\r\n[182] The commentators have thought it necessary to discuss the\r\nquestion, whether, in this passage, Pliny refers to the Ida of Crete\r\nor of Asia Minor. But the discussion is unnecessary, as the statement\r\nof the author is equally inapplicable to both of them. Mela appears to\r\nrefer to this opinion in the following passage, where he is describing\r\nthe Ida of Asia Minor; “ipse mens ... orientem solem aliter quam in\r\naliis terris solet aspici, ostentat.” lib. i. cap. 18.\r\n\r\n[183] “Ut dictum est superiore capite, quo Plinius falso contendit\r\nTerram esse Luna minorem.” Alexandre in Lemaire, ii. 253. The words of\r\nthe text, however, apply equally to the comparative size of the earth\r\nand the sun, as of the earth and the moon.\r\n\r\n[184] “turbo rectus;” literally an upright top.\r\n\r\n[185] “meta.”\r\n\r\n[186] This has been pointed out as one of our author’s erroneous\r\nopinions on astronomy. The earth is really about 1/30 nearer the sun in\r\nour winters than in our summers. The greater degree of heat produced\r\nby his rays in the latter case depends upon their falling on the\r\nsurface of the earth less obliquely. This is the principal cause of the\r\ndifferent temperatures of the equatorial and polar regions.\r\n\r\n[187] This eclipse is calculated to have occurred on the 28th of June,\r\n168 B.C.; Brewster’s Encyc. “Chronology,” p. 415, 424. We have an\r\naccount of this transaction in Livy, xliv. 37, and in Plutarch, Life of\r\nPaulus Æmilius, Langhorne’s trans. ii. 279; he however does not mention\r\nthe name of Gallus. See also Val. Maximus, viii. 11. 1, and Quintilian,\r\ni. 10. Val. Maximus does not say that Gallus predicted the eclipse, but\r\nexplained the cause of it when it had occurred; and the same statement\r\nis made by Cicero, De Repub. i. 15. For an account of Sulpicius, see\r\nHardouin’s Index auctorum, Lemaire, i. 214.\r\n\r\n[188] An account of this event is given by Herodotus, Clio, § 74. There\r\nhas been the same kind of discussion among the commentators, respecting\r\nthe dates in the text, as was noticed above, note [154], p. 29: see the\r\nremarks of Brotier and of Marcus in Lemaire and Ajasson, _in loco_.\r\nAstronomers have calculated that the eclipse took place May 28th, 585\r\nB.C.; Brewster, _ut supra_, pp. 414, 419.\r\n\r\n[189] Hipparchus is generally regarded as the first astronomer who\r\nprosecuted the science in a regular and systematic manner. See Whewell,\r\nC. 3. p. 169 _et seq._, 177-179. He is supposed to have made his\r\nobservations between the years 160 and 125 B.C. He made a catalogue of\r\nthe fixed stars, which is preserved in Ptolemy’s Magn. Const. The only\r\nwork of his now extant is his commentary on Aratus; it is contained in\r\nPetau’s Uranologie. We find, among the ancients, many traces of their\r\nacquaintance with the period of 600 years, or what is termed the great\r\nyear, when the solar and lunar phænomena recur precisely at the same\r\npoints. Cassini, Mem. Acad., and Bailly, Hist. Anc. Astron., have shown\r\nthat there is an actual foundation for this opinion. See the remarks of\r\nMarcus in Ajasson, ii. 302, 303.\r\n\r\n[190] Seneca, the tragedian, refers to this superstitious opinion in\r\nsome beautiful verses, which are given to the chorus at the termination\r\nof the fourth act of the Thyestes.\r\n\r\n[191] We have an account of this event in Thucydides, Smith’s trans.\r\nii. 244, and in Plutarch, Langhorne’s trans. iii. 406. It is calculated\r\nto have happened Aug. 27th, 413 B.C.; Brewster, _ut supra_, p. 415, 421.\r\n\r\n[192] The elegant lines of Ovid, in his Fasti, i. 297 _et seq._,\r\nexpress the same sentiment: “Felices animos, quibus hoc cognoscere\r\nprimis,” &c.\r\n\r\n[193] I have already remarked upon the use of this term as applied to\r\nthe eclipses of the moon in note [164], p. 31.\r\n\r\n[194] According to the remarks of Marcus, it appears probable that\r\nthis sol-lunar period, as it has been termed, was discovered by the\r\nChaldeans; Ajasson, ii. 306, 307.\r\n\r\n[195] “coitus.”\r\n\r\n[196] “Hoc enim periodo (223 mensium) plerumque redeunt eclipses, non\r\nmultum differentes, denis tamen gradibus zodiaci antecedentes;” Kepler,\r\nas quoted by Alexandre, in Lemaire, ii. 238.\r\n\r\n[197] The terms “sub terra” and “superne” are interpreted, by most of\r\nthe commentators, below and above the horizon respectively; see Marcus\r\nin Ajasson, ii. 307.\r\n\r\n[198] “globo terræ obstante convexitatibus mundi.” The term _convexus_,\r\nas applied to the heavens, or visible firmament, simply signifies\r\n_arched_; not opposed to _concave_, like the English word _convex_.\r\n\r\n[199] This point is discussed by Ptolemy, Magn. Const. vi. 6; “De\r\ndistantia eclipticorum mensium.” See also the remarks of Hardouin in\r\nLemaire, ii. 260, 261; and of Poinsinet, i. 67.\r\n\r\n[200] These are styled horizontal eclipses; they depend on the\r\nrefractive power of the atmosphere, causing the sun to be visible above\r\nthe horizon, although it is actually below it. Brotier states, that\r\neclipses of this description occurred on the 17th July, 1590, on the\r\n30th November, 1648, and on the 16th January, 1660; Lemaire, ii. 260.\r\n\r\n[201] This is supposed to have been in the year 72 of our æra, when it\r\nis said that the sun was eclipsed, in Italy, on the 8th, and the moon\r\non the 22nd of February; see Hardouin and Alexandre, in Lemaire, ii.\r\n261.\r\n\r\n[202] In a subsequent part of the work, xviii. 75, the author gives\r\na different rate of increase, viz. 51-1/2 minutes; neither of these\r\nnumbers is correct; the mean rate of increase being, according to\r\nAlexandre, about 54′ or 55′; Lemaire, ii. 261, 262. See also Marcus in\r\nAjasson, ii. 311-14.\r\n\r\n[203] It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the effect, as here\r\nstated, has no connexion with the supposed cause.\r\n\r\n[204] “luminum canonica.”\r\n\r\n[205] Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.\r\n\r\n[206] They are then said, in astronomical language, to rise heliacally.\r\n\r\n[207] In the last chapter this distance was stated to be 7 degrees; see\r\nthe remarks of Alexandre, in Lemaire, ii. 263.\r\n\r\n[208] “radiorum ejus contactu reguntur.” The doctrine of the ancient\r\nastronomers was, that the motions of the planets are always governed by\r\nthe rays of the sun, according to its position, attracting or repelling\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[209] A planet appears to be stationary, _i. e._ to be referred to\r\nthe same point of the zodiac, when it is so situated with respect to\r\nthe earth, that a straight line passing through the two bodies forms\r\na tangent to the smaller orbit. The apparent motion of the planets,\r\nsometimes direct and at other times retrograde, with their stationary\r\npositions, is occasioned by the earth and the planets moving in\r\nconcentric orbits, with different velocities. One hundred and twenty\r\ndegrees is the mean distance at which the three superior planets become\r\nstationary. We have an elaborate dissertation by Marcus, on the unequal\r\nvelocities of the planets, and on their stations and retrogradations,\r\nas well according to the system of Aristotle as to that of Copernicus;\r\nAjasson, ii. 316 _et seq._ He remarks, and, I conceive, with justice,\r\n“... ce n’est pas dans les traités d’astronomie de nos savans que l’on\r\ndoit puiser les détails destinés à éclaircir le texte des chapitres\r\nxii, xiii, xiv et xv du second livre de Pline.... Je ne dis rien des\r\ncommentaires de Poinsinet, d’Hardouin et d’autres savans peu versés\r\nen matière d’astronomie, qui ont fait dire à Pline les plus grandes\r\nabsurdités.”\r\n\r\n[210] “Occasus planetæ vespertinus dicitur, quo die desinit post\r\noccasum solis supra horizontem oculis se præbere manifestum;” Alexandre\r\nin Lemaire, ii. 265. It is then said to set heliacally.\r\n\r\n[211] The interpretation of this passage has given rise to much\r\ndiscussion among the commentators and translators; I may refer the\r\nreader to the remarks of Poinsinet, i. 70, 71; of Alexandre in Lemaire,\r\nii. 266; and of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 328. I conceive the meaning\r\nof the author to be, that while the other planets become stationary,\r\nwhen at 120 degrees from the sun, Mars becomes so at 90 degrees,\r\nbeing detained by the rays, which act upon him more powerfully, in\r\nconsequence of his being nearer to their source.\r\n\r\n[212] I may refer to the remarks of Marcus on the respective distances\r\nfrom the sun at which Venus and Mercury become stationary, and when\r\nthey attain their greatest elongations; Ajasson, ii. 328, 329.\r\nAccording to Ptolemy, Magn. Constr. lib. viii. cap. 7, the evening\r\nsetting of Venus is at 5° 40′ from the sun, and that of Mercury at 11°\r\n30′.\r\n\r\n[213] “Ἁψὶς, ligneus rotæ circulus, ab ἅπτω necto;” Hederic _in loco_.\r\nThe term is employed in a somewhat different sense by the modern\r\nastronomers, to signify the point in the orbit of a planet, when it\r\nis either at the greatest or the least distance from the earth, or\r\nthe body about which it revolves; the former being termed the apogee,\r\naphelion, or the higher apsis; the latter the perigee, perhelion, or\r\nlower apsis; Jennings on the Globes, pp. 64, 65.\r\n\r\n[214] “mundo.”\r\n\r\n[215] “ratione circini semper indubitata.”\r\n\r\n[216] In consequence of the precession of the equinoxes these points\r\nare continually advancing from W. to E., and are now about 30 degrees\r\nfrom the situation they were in when the observations were first made\r\nby the modern astronomers.\r\n\r\n[217] Our author here probably refers to the motions of the planets\r\nthrough their epicycles or secondary circles, the centres of which were\r\nsupposed to be in the peripheries of the primary circles. See Alexandre\r\nin Lemaire, ii. 270.\r\n\r\n[218] It is to this visible appearance of convexity in the heavens that\r\nOvid refers in the story of Phaëton, where he is describing the daily\r\npath of the sun; Metam. ii. 63-67.\r\n\r\n[219] “quam quod illi subjacet;” under this designation the author\r\nobviously meant to include the temperate zones, although it technically\r\napplies only to the part between the tropics. It is scarcely necessary\r\nto remark, that modern discoveries have shown that this opinion\r\nrespecting the Arctic zone is not strictly correct.\r\n\r\n[220] The breadth of the zodiac, which was limited by the ancients\r\nto 12 degrees, has been extended by the modern astronomers to 18,\r\nand would require to be much farther extended to include the newly\r\ndiscovered planet. Herschel’s Astronomy, § 254.\r\n\r\n[221] There is considerable difficulty in ascertaining the meaning\r\nof the terms employed by our author in describing the course of\r\nthe planet Mercury through the zodiac; “medio ejus,” “supra,” and\r\n“infra.” Hardouin’s comment is as follows: “Duas zodiaci partes seu\r\ngradus pererrat, quum ipse per medium incedit signiferum: supra, quum\r\ndeflectit ad Aquilonem, per quatuor alias ejusdem partes vagatur:\r\ninfra, quum descendit ad Austrum, discedit duabus.” Lemaire, ii. 271,\r\n272. But Marcus has shown that the opinion of Hardouin is inadmissible\r\nand inconsistent with the facts; Ajasson, ii. 338-341. He proposes one,\r\nwhich he conceives to be more correct, but we may probably be led to\r\nthe conclusion, that the imperfect knowledge and incorrect opinions of\r\nour author on these subjects must render it impossible to afford an\r\nadequate explanation.\r\n\r\n[222] “flexuoso draconum meatu;” Poinsinet remarks, “Les Grecs ...\r\nappellaient dragons les bracelets, les hausse-cols, les chainettes, et\r\ngénéralement tout ce qui avait une figure armillaire;” i. 79, 80.\r\n\r\n[223] As this remark appears to contradict what was said in the last\r\nsentence respecting the sun, we may suspect some error in the text; see\r\nPoinsinet, Alexandre, and Marcus, _in loco_.\r\n\r\n[224] The following comparative statement is given by Alexandre of the\r\ngeocentric latitudes of the planets, as assigned by Pliny, and as laid\r\ndown by the moderns. Lemaire, ii. 273:—\r\n\r\n              _Pliny._    _Moderns._\r\n  Venus         8°          9° 22′\r\n  Moon          6           6   0\r\n  Mercury       5           6  54\r\n  Mars          2  0        1  51\r\n  Jupiter       1 30        1  30\r\n  Saturn        1 (or 2°)   2  30\r\n\r\n[225] It appears from the remark at the end of this chapter, that this\r\nexplanation applies to the superior planets alone.\r\n\r\n[226] It is not easy, as Marcus observes, Ajasson, ii. 341, 345, to\r\ncomprehend the exact meaning of this passage, or to reconcile it with\r\nthe other parts of our author’s theory.\r\n\r\n[227] “Ecliptica,” called by the moderns the nodes; i. e. the two\r\npoints where the orbits of the planets cut the ecliptic. See the\r\nremarks of Marcus on this term; Ajasson, ii. 345, 346.\r\n\r\n[228] We may presume that our author here refers to the apparent motion\r\nof the planets, not to their actual acceleration or retardation.\r\n\r\n[229] The editors have differed in the reading of this passage; I have\r\nfollowed that of Lemaire.\r\n\r\n[230] “incipit detrahi numerus.” According to the explanation of\r\nAlexandre, “numerus nempe partium quas certo temporis intervallo\r\nemetiuntur.” Lemaire, ii. 275. Marcus remarks in this place, “Dans tout\r\nce chapitre et dans le suivant, Pline a placé dans une correlation de\r\ncausité, tout ce qu’il croit arriver en même temps; mais il n’a pas\r\nprouvé par-là que les phenomènes célestes qui sont contemporains sont\r\nengendrés les uns par les autres.” Ajasson, ii. 349.\r\n\r\n[231] The hypothesis of Pliny appears to be, that the planets are\r\naffected by the rays of the sun, and that according to the angle at\r\nwhich they receive the impulse, they are either accelerated or retarded\r\nin their course.\r\n\r\n[232] “ex priore triquetro.”\r\n\r\n[233] Alexandre supposes, as I conceive justly, that our author, in\r\nthis passage, only refers to the writings of his own countrymen;\r\nLemaire, ii. 276.\r\n\r\n[234] According to Ptolemy, these numbers are respectively 47° 51′ and\r\n24° 3′; the modern astronomers have ascertained them to be 48° and 29°.\r\nThe least elongations of the planets are, according to Ptolemy, 44° 7′\r\nand 18° 50′, and according to the observations of the moderns, 45° and\r\n16°; Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 354.\r\n\r\n[235] I have not translated the clause, “quum sint diversæ stelæ,” as,\r\naccording to Hardouin, it is not found “in probatissimis codd.,” and\r\nappears to have little connexion with the other parts of the sentence;\r\nit is omitted by Valpy and Lemaire, but is retained by Poinsinet and\r\nAjasson.\r\n\r\n[236] When these inferior planets have arrived at a certain apparent\r\ndistance from the sun, they are come to the extent of their orbits, as\r\nseen from the earth.\r\n\r\n[237] “Quum ad illam Solis distantiam pervenerunt, ultra procedere\r\nnon possunt, deficiente circuli longitudine, id est, amplitudine.”\r\nAlexandre in Lemaire, ii. 277.\r\n\r\n[238] The transits of the inferior planets had not been observed by the\r\nancients.\r\n\r\n[239] “utroque modo;” “latitudine et altitudine;” Hardouin in Lemaire,\r\nii. 279.\r\n\r\n[240] “Catholica.”\r\n\r\n[241] “... quæ (stella Martis) ut maxime excentrica volvitur, motus\r\netiam maxime dissonos habere diu visa est....;” Alexandre in Lemaire,\r\nii. 180.\r\n\r\n[242] “... qui numerus sexangulas mundi efficit formas.”\r\n\r\n[243] Lynceus was one of the Argonauts and was celebrated for the\r\nacuteness of his vision; Val. Flaccus, i. 462 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[244] The relative situation of these astronomical phænomena has\r\nchanged since the time of Pliny, in consequence of the precession of\r\nthe equinoxes. For an illustration and explanation of the various\r\nstatements in this chapter I may refer to the remarks of Marcus in\r\nAjasson, ii. 368-370.\r\n\r\n[245] Ptolemy’s account of the colours of the planets is nearly similar\r\nto that of our author; “Candidus color Jovialis est, rutilus Martius,\r\nflavus Veneris, varius Mercurii;” De Jur. Astrol. ii. 9.\r\n\r\n[246] This effect cannot be produced by any of the planets, except\r\nperhaps, to a certain extent, by Venus.\r\n\r\n[247] “mundi.”\r\n\r\n[248] It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the method which Pliny\r\nemploys to explain the different phases of the moon betrays his\r\nignorance, not only of the cause of these particular phænomena, but\r\nof the general principles which affect the appearance of the heavenly\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n[249] “seminani ambitur orbe.” According to the interpretation of\r\nHardouin, “Orbe non perfecto et absoluto;” “major dimidia, minor\r\nplena;” Lemaire, ii. 284.\r\n\r\n[250] As Alexandre justly remarks, our author refers here to the\r\naspects only of the planets, not to their phases; ii. 284.\r\n\r\n[251] “centrum terræ;” the equator, the part equally distant from the\r\ntwo poles or extremities.\r\n\r\n[252] It may be remarked, that the equinoxes did not actually take\r\nplace at this period in the points mentioned by Pliny, but in the\r\n28th degrees of Pisces and Virgo respectively; he appears to have\r\nconformed to the popular opinion, as we may learn from Columella, lib.\r\nix. cap. 14. The degrees mentioned above were those fixed by the Greek\r\nastronomers who formed the celestial sphere, and which was about 138\r\nyears before the Christian æra. See the remarks of Marcus in Ajasson,\r\nii. 246 & 373, 374.\r\n\r\n[253] The same remark applies to this as to the former observation.\r\n\r\n[254] “siderum.”\r\n\r\n[255] The hypothesis of the author is, that the excess of moisture in\r\nthe orbit of Saturn, and the excess of heat in that of Mars, unite in\r\nthe orbit of Jupiter and are discharged in the form of thunder.\r\n\r\n[256] Alexandre remarks, that Pliny mentions this, not as his own\r\nopinion, but that of _many_ persons; for, in chap. 21, he attempts to\r\nprove mathematically, that the moon is situated at an equal distance\r\nbetween the sun and the earth; Lemaire, ii. 286.\r\n\r\n[257] Marcus remarks upon the inconsistency between the account here\r\ngiven of Pythagoras’s opinion, and what is generally supposed to have\r\nbeen his theory of the planetary system, according to which the sun,\r\nand not the earth, is placed in the centre; Enfield’s Philosophy, i.\r\n288, 289. Yet we find that Plato, and many others among the ancients,\r\ngive us the same account of Pythagoras’s doctrine of the respective\r\ndistances of the heavenly bodies; Ajasson, ii. 374. Plato in his\r\nTimæus, 9. p. 312-315, details the complicated arrangement which he\r\nsupposes to constitute the proportionate distances of the planetary\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n[258] Sulpicius has already been mentioned, in the ninth chapter of\r\nthis book, as being the first among the Romans who gave a popular\r\nexplanation of the cause of eclipses.\r\n\r\n[259] “Διὰ πασῶν, omnibus tonis contextam harmoniam.” Hardouin in\r\nLemaire, ii. 287.\r\n\r\n[260] These appellations appear to have originated from different\r\nnations having assumed different notes as the foundation or\r\ncommencement of their musical scale. The Abbé Barthelemi informs\r\nus, that “the Dorians executed the same air a tone lower than the\r\nPhrygians, and the latter a tone still higher than the Lydians; hence\r\nthe denomination of the Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian modes.” It appears\r\nto have been a general practice to employ the lowest modes for the\r\nslowest airs; Anacharsis’s Travels, iii. 73, 74.\r\n\r\n[261] Hence the passus will be equal to 5 Roman feet. If we estimate\r\nthe Roman foot at 11·6496 English inches, we shall have the _miliare_\r\nof 8 stadia equal to 1618 English yards, or 142 yards less than an\r\nEnglish statute mile. See Adam’s Roman Antiquities, p. 503; also the\r\narticles Miliare and Pes in Smith’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman\r\nAntiquities; and for the varieties of the stadium, as employed at\r\ndifferent periods and in different countries, see the article Stadium.\r\nThe stadium which Herodotus employed in measurements of Babylon has\r\nbeen supposed to consist of 490 English feet, while that of Xenophon\r\nand Strabo has been estimated at 505; see Ed. Rev. xlviii. 190. The\r\nAbbé Barthelemi supposes the stadium to be equal to 604 English feet;\r\nAnach. Travels, vii. 284.\r\n\r\n[262] There appears to have been two individuals of this name, who\r\nhave been confounded with each other; the one referred to by Pliny was\r\nan astronomer of Alexandria, who flourished about 260 years B.C.; the\r\nother was a native of Apamea, a stoic philosopher, who lived about two\r\ncenturies later; see Aikin’s Biog. _in loco_; also Hardouin’s Index\r\nAuctorum, Lemaire, i. 209.\r\n\r\n[263] The terms in the original are respectively _nubila_ and _nubes_.\r\nThe lexicographers and grammarians do not appear to have accurately\r\ndiscriminated between these two words.\r\n\r\n[264] The words in the text are “vicies centum millia” and “quinquies\r\nmillia.”\r\n\r\n[265] Archimedes estimated that the diameter of a circle is to its\r\ncircumference as 1 to 3·1416; Hutton’s Dict. _in loco_. Ptolemy states\r\nit to be precisely as 1 to 3; Magn. Const. i. 12.\r\n\r\n[266] The author’s reasoning is founded upon the supposition of the\r\nlength of the sun’s path round the earth being twelve times greater\r\nthan that of the moon’s; the orbit therefore would be twelve times\r\ngreater and the radius in the same proportion.\r\n\r\n[267] “Non inter Lunam et Saturnum, sed inter Lunam et cœlum affixarum\r\nstellarum, medium esse Solem modo dixerat. Quam parum sui meminit!”\r\nAlexandre in Lem. i. 291.\r\n\r\n[268] “Qui computandi modus plurimum habet verecundiæ et modestiæ, quum\r\nibi sistit, nec ulterius progreditur.” Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 292.\r\n\r\n[269] “... ad Saturni circulum addito Signiferi ipsius intervallo, ...”\r\n\r\n[270] We may remark, that our author, for the most part, adopts the\r\nopinions of Aristotle respecting comets and meteors of all kinds, while\r\nhe pays but little attention to those of his contemporary Seneca,\r\nwhich however, on some points, would appear to be more correct.\r\nSee the remarks of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 244. Under the title of\r\ncomets he includes, not only those bodies which are permanent and\r\nmove in regular orbits, but such as are transient, and are produced\r\nfrom various causes, the nature of which is not well understood. See\r\nAristotle, Meteor. lib. i. cap. 6, 7, and Seneca, Nat. Quæst. lib. 7,\r\nand Manilius, i. 807 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[271] a κόμη, coma.\r\n\r\n[272] a πωγωνίος, barbatus. Most of these terms are employed by\r\nAristotle and by Seneca.\r\n\r\n[273] ab ἀκόντιον, jaculum.\r\n\r\n[274] a ξίφος, ensis.\r\n\r\n[275] a δίσκος, orbis.\r\n\r\n[276] a πίθος, dolium. Seneca describes this species as “magnitudo\r\nvasti rotundique ignis dolio similis;” Nat. Quæst. lib. i. § 14. p. 964.\r\n\r\n[277] a κέρας, cornu.\r\n\r\n[278] a λαμπὰς, fax.\r\n\r\n[279] ab ἵππος, equus. Seneca mentions the fax, the jaculum, and the\r\nlampas among the prodigies that preceded the civil wars; Phars. i. 528\r\n_et seq._\r\n\r\n[280] Alexandre remarks, that these dates do not correspond, and adds,\r\n“Desperandum est de Pliniana chronologia; nec satis interdum scio,\r\nutrum librarios, an scriptorem ipsum incusem,....” Lemaire, i. 295.\r\nAccording to the most approved modern chronology, the middle of the\r\n109th olympiad corresponds to the 211th year of the City.\r\n\r\n[281] “errantium modo;” this may mean, that they move in orbits like\r\nthose of the planets and exhibit the same phænomena, or simply that\r\nthey change their situation with respect to the fixed stars.\r\n\r\n[282] Seneca remarks on this point, “Placet igitur nostris (Stoicis)\r\ncometas ... denso aëri creari. Ideo circa Septemtrionem frequentissime\r\napparent, quia illic plurimi est aëris frigor.” Quæst. Nat. i. 7.\r\nAristotle, on the contrary, remarks that comets are less frequently\r\nproduced in the northern part of the heavens; Meteor. lib. i. cap. 6.\r\np. 535.\r\n\r\n[283] _Ubi supra._\r\n\r\n[284] See Aristotle, _ut supra_, p. 537.\r\n\r\n[285] “Videtur is non cometes fuisse, sed meteorus quidam ignis;”\r\nAlexandre in Lemaire, i. 296.\r\n\r\n[286] Virgil, Geor. i. 488 _et seq._, Manilius, i. 904 _et seq._, and\r\nLucan, i. 526 _et seq._, all speak of the comets and meteors that\r\nwere observed previous to the civil wars between Pompey and Cæsar. In\r\nreference to the existence of a comet about the time of Julius Cæsar,\r\nPlayfair remarks, that Halley supposed the great comet of 1680 to\r\nhave been the same that appeared in the year 44 A.C., and again in\r\nJustinian’s time, 521 P.C., and also in 1106; Elem. Nat. Phil. ii. 197,\r\n198. See Ptolemy’s Cent. Dict. no. 100, for the opinion, that comets\r\npresented an omen especially unfavourable to kings. To this opinion the\r\nfollowing passage in the Paradise Lost obviously refers; “And with fear\r\nof change perplexes monarchs.”\r\n\r\n[287] Seneca refers to the four comets that were seen, after the death\r\nof Cæsar, in the time of Augustus, of Claudius, and of Nero; Quæst.\r\nNat. i. 7. Suetonius mentions the comet which appeared previous to the\r\ndeath of Claudius, cap. 46, and Tacitus that before the death of Nero,\r\nAnn. xiv. 22.\r\n\r\n[288] “A Julio Cæsare. Is enim paulo ante obitum collegium his ludis\r\nfaciendis instituerat, confecto Veneris templo;” Hardouin in Lemaire,\r\ni. 299. Jul. Obsequens refers to a “stella crinita,” which appeared\r\nduring the celebration of these games, cap. 128.\r\n\r\n[289] “Hoc est, hora fere integra ante solis occasum;” Hardouin in\r\nLemaire, i. 299.\r\n\r\n[290] All these circumstances are detailed by Suetonius, in Julio, §\r\n88. p. 178.\r\n\r\n[291] “terris.”\r\n\r\n[292] Seneca remarks, “... quidam nullos esse cometas existimant, sed\r\nspecies illorum per repercussionem vicinorum siderum,... Quidam aiunt\r\nesse quidem, sed habere cursus suos et post certa lustra in conspectum\r\nmortalium exire.” He concludes by observing, “Veniet tempus, quo ista\r\nquæ nunc latent, in lucem dies extrahat, et longioris diei diligentia;”\r\nNat. Quæst. lib. 7. § 19. p. 807.\r\n\r\n[293] For some account of Hipparchus, see note [189], p. 37.\r\n\r\n[294] Nothing is known respecting the nature of these instruments, nor\r\nhave we any means of forming even a conjecture upon the subject.\r\n\r\n[295] The terms “faces,” “lampades,” “bolides,” and “trabes,” literally\r\ntorches, lamps, darts, and beams, which are employed to express\r\ndifferent kinds of meteors, have no corresponding words in English\r\nwhich would correctly designate them.\r\n\r\n[296] From this account it would appear, that the “fax” was what we\r\nterm a falling star. “Meteora ista, super cervices nostras transeuntia,\r\ndiversaque a stellis labentibus, modo aërolithis ascribenda sunt, modo\r\nvaporibus incensis aut electrica vi prognata videntur, et quamvis\r\nfrequentissime recurrant, explicatione adhuc incerta indigent.”\r\nAlexandre in Lemaire, i. 302.\r\n\r\n[297] Seneca refers to this meteor; “Vidimus non semel flammam ingenti\r\npilæ specie, quæ tamen in ipso cursu suo dissipata est ... nec\r\nGermanici mors sine tali demonstratione fuit;” Nat. Quæst, lib. i. cap.\r\n1. p. 683.\r\n\r\n[298] This meteor is mentioned by Dion Cassius, lib. xlv. p. 278, but\r\nis described by him as a lampas.\r\n\r\n[299] We may presume that the _trabes_ are, for the most part, to be\r\nreferred to the aurora borealis. _The chasma_ and the appearances\r\ndescribed in the twenty-seventh chapter are probably varieties of this\r\nmeteor. On these phænomena we have the following remarks by Seneca:\r\n“Lucem in aëre, seu quamdam albedinem, angustam quidem, sed oblongam,\r\nde noctu quandoque visam, sereno cœlo, si parallelo situ sit, Trabem\r\nvocant; si perpendiculari, Columnam; si, cum cuspide Bolida, sive\r\nJaculum.” Nat. Quæst. vii. 4, and again, vii. 5, “Trabes autem non\r\ntranscurrunt nec prætervolant, ut faces, sed commorantur, et in eadem\r\nparte cœli collucent.”\r\n\r\n[300] Seneca describes this meteor, _ubi supra_, i. 14. “Sunt chasmata,\r\ncum aliquando cœli spatium discedit, et flammam dehiscens velut in\r\nabdito ostentat. Colores quoque horum omnium plurimi sunt. Quidam\r\nruboris acerrimi, quidam evanidæ et levis flammæ, quidam candidæ lucis,\r\nquidam micantes, quidam æquabiliter et sine eruptionibus aut radiis\r\nfulvi.” Aristotle’s account of chasmata is contained in his Meteor.\r\nlib. i. cap. 5. p. 534.\r\n\r\n[301] The meteor here referred to is probably a peculiar form of the\r\naurora borealis, which occasionally assumes a red colour. See the\r\nremarks of Fouché, in Ajasson, i. 382.\r\n\r\n[302] The doctrine of the author appears to be, that the prodigies are\r\nnot the cause, but only the indication of the events which succeed\r\nthem. This doctrine is referred to by Seneca; “Videbimus an certus\r\nomnium rerum ordo ducatur, et alia aliis ita complexa sint, ut quod\r\nantecedit, aut causa sit sequentium aut signum.” Nat. Quæst. i. 1.\r\n\r\n[303] It would appear that, in this passage, two phænomena are\r\nconfounded together; certain brilliant stars, as, for example, Venus,\r\nwhich have been occasionally seen in the day-time, and the formation\r\nof different kinds of halos, depending on certain states of the\r\natmosphere, which affect its transparency.\r\n\r\n[304] This occurrence is mentioned by Seneca, Nat. Quæst. i. 2; he\r\nenters into a detailed explanation of the cause; also by V. Paterculus,\r\nii. 59, and by Jul. Obsequens, cap. 128. We can scarcely doubt of the\r\nreality of the occurrence, as these authors would not have ventured to\r\nrelate what, if not true, might have been so easily contradicted.\r\n\r\n[305] The term here employed is “arcus,” which is a portion only of a\r\ncircle or “orbis.” But if we suppose that the sun was near the horizon,\r\na portion only of the halo would be visible, or the condition of the\r\natmosphere adapted for forming the halo might exist in one part only,\r\nso that a portion of the halo only would be obscured.\r\n\r\n[306] The dimness or paleness of the sun, which is stated by various\r\nwriters to have occurred at the time of Cæsar’s death, it is\r\nunnecessary to remark, was a phænomenon totally different from an\r\neclipse, and depending on a totally different cause.\r\n\r\n[307] Aristotle, Meteor. lib. iii. cap. 2. p. 575, cap. 6. p. 582, 583,\r\nand Seneca, Quæst. Nat. lib. i. § 11, describe these appearances under\r\nthe title which has been retained by the moderns of παρήλια. Aristotle\r\nremarks on their cause as depending on the refraction (ἀνάκλασις) of\r\nthe sun’s rays. He extends the remark to the production of halos (ἅλως)\r\nand the rainbow, _ubi supra_.\r\n\r\n[308] This occurrence is referred to by Livy, xli. 21.\r\n\r\n[309] This meteor has been named παρασελήνη; they are supposed to\r\ndepend upon the same cause with the Parhelia. A phænomenon of this\r\ndescription is mentioned by Jul. Obsequens, cap. 92, and by Plutarch,\r\nin Marcellus, ii. 360. In Shakspeare’s King John the death of Prince\r\nArthur is said to have been followed by the ominous appearance of five\r\nmoons.\r\n\r\n[310] This phænomenon must be referred to the aurora borealis. See\r\nLivy, xxviii. 11. and xxix. 14.\r\n\r\n[311] “clypei.”\r\n\r\n[312] Probably an aërolite. Jul. Obsequens describes a meteor as “orbis\r\nclypei similis,” which was seen to pass from west to east, cap. 105.\r\n\r\n[313] “ceu nubilo die.”\r\n\r\n[314] It would be difficult to reconcile this phænomenon with any\r\nacknowledged atmospherical phenomenon.\r\n\r\n[315] Perhaps the phænomena here alluded to ought to be referred to\r\nsome electric action; but they are stated too generally to admit of our\r\nforming more than a conjecture on the subject. Virgil refers to the\r\noccurrence of storms of wind after the appearance of a falling star;\r\nGeor. i. 265-6.\r\n\r\n[316] These phænomena are admitted to be electrical; they are referred\r\nto by Seneca, Nat. Quæst. i. 1. This appearance is noticed as of\r\nfrequent occurrence in the Mediterranean, where it is named the fire of\r\nSt. Elmo; see Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 311, and Fouché in Ajasson, ii.\r\n382.\r\n\r\n[317] Perhaps this opinion may be maintained on the principle, that,\r\nwhen there is a single luminous appearance only, it depends upon the\r\ndischarge of a quantity of electrical fluid in a condensed state; its\r\neffects are, in this case, those that would follow from a stroke of\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\n[318] This is said by Livy to have occurred to Servius Tullius while he\r\nwas a child; lib. i. cap. 39; and by Virgil to Ascanius, Æn. ii. 632-5.\r\n\r\n[319] “Ut circumagendo balistæ vel fundæ impetus augetur.” Alexandre in\r\nLemaire, i. 313.\r\n\r\n[320] “sed assidue rapta (natura) convolvitur, et circa terram immenso\r\nrerum causas globo ostendit, subinde per nubes cœlum aliud obtexens.”\r\nOn the words “immenso globo,” Alexandre has the following comment:\r\n“Immensis cœli fornicibus appicta sidera, dum circumvolvitur, terris\r\nostendit;” and on the words “cœlum aliud,” “obductæ scilicet nubes\r\nfalsum quasi cœlum vero prætexunt.” Lemaire, i. 313.\r\n\r\n[321] The author probably means to speak of all the atmospheric\r\nphænomena that have been mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[322] Marcus has made some remarks on this subject which may be read\r\nwith advantage; Ajasson, ii. 245-6.\r\n\r\n[323] The diminutive of Sus.\r\n\r\n[324] Ab ὕω, pluo.\r\n\r\n[325] The Hædi were in the constellation Auriga.\r\n\r\n[326] We have the same account of the Oryx in Ælian, lib. vii. cap. 8.\r\n\r\n[327] Our author again refers to this opinion, viii. 63, and it was\r\ngenerally adopted by the ancients; but it appears to be entirely\r\nunfounded.\r\n\r\n[328] “cum tempestatibus confici sidus intelligimus.”\r\n\r\n[329] “afflantur.” On this term Hardouin remarks, “Siderantur.\r\nSideratio morbi genus est, partem aliquam corporis, ipsumque sæpe\r\ntotum corpus percutientis subito: quod quum repentino eveniat impetu, e\r\ncœlo vi quadam sideris evenire putatur.” Lemaire, i. 317.\r\n\r\n[330] Cicero alludes to these opinions in his treatise De Divin. ii.\r\n33; see also Aul. Gellius, ix. 7.\r\n\r\n[331] The heliotropium of the moderns has not the property here\r\nassigned to it, and it may be doubted whether it exists in any plant,\r\nexcept in a very slight and imperfect degree: the subject will be\r\nconsidered more fully in a subsequent part of the work, xxii. 29, where\r\nthe author gives a more particular account of the heliotrope.\r\n\r\n[332] “conchyliorum;” this term appears to have been specifically\r\napplied to the animal from which the Tyrian dye was procured.\r\n\r\n[333] “soricum fibras;” Alexandre remarks on these words, “fibras\r\njecoris intellige, id est, lobos infimos ...;” Lemaire, i. 318; but I\r\ndo not see any ground for this interpretation.\r\n\r\n[334] It does not appear from what source our author derived this\r\nnumber; it is considerably greater than that stated by Ptolemy and the\r\nolder astronomers. See the remarks of Hardouin and of Brotier; Lemaire.\r\ni. 319.\r\n\r\n[335] The Vergiliæ or Pleiades are not in the tail of the Bull,\r\naccording to the celestial atlas of the moderns.\r\n\r\n[336] “Septemtriones.”\r\n\r\n[337] The doctrine of Aristotle on the nature and formation of mists\r\nand clouds is contained in his treatises De Meteor. lib. i. cap. 9.\r\np. 540, and De Mundo, cap. 4. p. 605. He employs the terms ἀτμὶς,\r\nνέφος, and νεφέλη, which are translated _vapor_, _nubes_ and _nebula_,\r\nrespectively. The distinction, however, between the two latter does not\r\nappear very clearly marked either in the Greek or the Latin, the two\r\nGreek words being indiscriminately applied to either of the Latin terms.\r\n\r\n[338] It is doubtful how far this statement is correct; see the remarks\r\nof Hardouin, Lem. i. 320.\r\n\r\n[339] The words in the original are respectively _fulmen_ and\r\n_fulgetrum_; Seneca makes a similar distinction between _fulmen_ and\r\n_fulguratio_: “Fulguratio est late ignis explicitus; fulmen est coactus\r\nignis et impetu jactus.” Nat. Quæst. lib. ii. cap. 16. p. 706.\r\n\r\n[340] “Præsertim ex tribus superioribus planetis, uti dictum est, cap.\r\n18.” Hardouin, in Lemaire, i. 322.\r\n\r\n[341] Our author’s opinion respecting the origin of winds nearly\r\nagrees with that of Aristotle; “nihil ut aliud ventus (ἄνεμος) sit,\r\nnisi aër multus fluctuans et compressus, qui etiam spiritus (πνεῦμα)\r\nappellatur;” De Meteor. This treatise contains a full account of the\r\nphænomena of winds. Seneca also remarks, “Ventus est aër fluens;” Nat.\r\nQuæst. lib. 3 & 5.\r\n\r\n[342] Aristotle informs us, that the winds termed apogæi (ἀπόγαιοι)\r\nproceed from a marshy and moist soil; De Mundo, cap. 4. p. 605. For\r\nthe origin and meaning of the terms here applied to the winds, see the\r\nremarks of Hardouin and Alexandre, in Lemaire, i. 323.\r\n\r\n[343] This is mentioned by Pomp. Mela.\r\n\r\n[344] “In domibus etiam multis manu facta inclusa opacitate\r\nconceptacula....” Some of the MSS. have _madefacta_ for _manu facta_,\r\nand this reading has been adopted by Lemaire; but nearly all the\r\neditors, as Dalechamps, Laët, Grovonius, Poincinet and Ajasson, retain\r\nthe former word.\r\n\r\n[345] The terms in the original are “flatus” and “ventus.”\r\n\r\n[346] “illos (flatus) statos atque perspirantes.”\r\n\r\n[347] “qui non aura, non procella, sed mares appellatione quoque ipsa\r\nventi sunt.” This passage cannot be translated into English, from\r\nour language not possessing the technical distinction of genders, as\r\ndepending on the termination of the substantives.\r\n\r\n[348] “Septem nimirum errantibus.” Hardouin, in Lemaire, i. 306.\r\n\r\n[349] In his account and nomenclature of the winds, Pliny has, for the\r\nmost part, followed Aristotle, Meteor. lib. ii. cap. 4. pp. 558-560,\r\nand cap. 6. pp. 563-565. The description of the different winds by\r\nSeneca is not very different, but where it does not coincide with\r\nAristotle’s, our author has generally preferred the former; see Nat.\r\nQuæst. lib. 5. We have an account of the different winds, as prevailing\r\nat particular seasons, in Ptolemy, De Judiciis Astrol. 1. 9. For the\r\nnomenclature and directions of the winds, we may refer to the remarks\r\nof Hardouin, Lemaire, i. 328 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[350] Odyss. v. 295, 296.\r\n\r\n[351] In giving names to the different winds, the author designates the\r\npoints of the compass whence they proceed, by the place where the sun\r\nrises or sets, at the different periods of the year. The following are\r\nthe terms which he employs:—“Oriens æquinoctialis,” the place where the\r\nsun rises at the equinox, i. e. the East. “Oriens brumalis,” where he\r\nrises on the shortest day, the S.E. “Occasus brumalis,” where he sets\r\non the shortest day, the S.W. “Occasus æquinoctialis,” where he sets\r\nat the equinox, the W. “Occasus solstitialis,” where he sets on the\r\nlongest day, the N.W. “Exortus solstitialis,” where he rises on the\r\nlongest day, the N.E. “Inter septemtrionem et occasum solstitialem,”\r\nbetween N. and N.W., N.N.W. “Inter aquilonem et exortum æquinoctialem,”\r\nbetween N. and N.E., N.N.E. “Inter ortum brumalem et meridiem,” between\r\nS. and S.E., S.S.E. “Inter meridiem et hybernum occidentem,” between S.\r\nand S.W., S.S.W.\r\n\r\n[352] “Quod sub sole nasci videtur.”\r\n\r\n[353] This name was probably derived from the town Vulturnum in\r\nCampania.\r\n\r\n[354] Seneca informs us, that what the Latins name Subsolanus, is named\r\nby the Greeks Ἀφηλιώτης; Quæst. Nat. lib. 5. § 16. p. 764.\r\n\r\n[355] “quia favet rebus nascentibus.”\r\n\r\n[356] “... semper spirantes frigora Cauri.” Virgil, Geor. iii. 356.\r\n\r\n[357] The eight winds here mentioned will bear the following relation\r\nto our nomenclature: Septemtrio, N.; Aquilo, N.E.; Subsolanus, E.;\r\nVulturnus, S.E.; Auster, S.; Africus, N.W.; Favonius, W.; and Corus,\r\nN.W.\r\n\r\n[358] The four winds here mentioned, added to eight others, making, in\r\nthe whole, twelve, will give us the following card:—\r\n\r\n  N. Septemtrio.\r\n  N.N.E. Boreas or Aquilo.\r\n  E.N.E. Cæcias.\r\n  E. Apeliotes or Subsolanus.\r\n  E.S.E. Eurus or Vulturnus.\r\n  S.S.E. Euronotus or Phœnices.\r\n  S. Notos or Auster.\r\n  S.S.W. Libonotos.\r\n  W.S.W. Libs or Africus.\r\n  W. Zephyrus or Favonius.\r\n  W.N.W. Argestes or Corus.\r\n  N.N.W. Thrascias.\r\n\r\nWe are informed by Alexandre, Lemaire, i. 330, that there is an ancient\r\ndial plate in the Vatican, consisting of twelve sides, in which the\r\nnames of the twelve winds are given both in Greek and in Latin. They\r\ndiffer somewhat from those given above, both absolutely and relatively;\r\nthey are as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Ἀπαρκτίας, Septemtrio.\r\n  Βορέας, Aquilo.\r\n  Καικίας, Vulturnus.\r\n  Ἀφηλιώτης, Solanus.\r\n  Εὖρος, Eurus.\r\n  Εὐρόνοτος, Euronotus.\r\n  Νότος, Auster.\r\n  Λιβόνοτος, Austroafricus.\r\n  Λὶψ, Africus.\r\n  Ζέφυρος, Zephyrus.\r\n  Ἰάπυξ, Corus.\r\n  Θρασκίας, Circius.\r\n\r\n[359] This wind must have been N.N.W.; it is mentioned by Strabo, iv.\r\n182; A. Gellius, ii. 22; Seneca, Nat. Quæst. v. 17; and again by our\r\nauthor, xvii. 2.\r\n\r\n[360] We may learn the opinions of the Romans on the subject of this\r\nchapter from Columella, xi. 2.\r\n\r\n[361] corresponding to the 8th day of the month.\r\n\r\n[362] ... lustro sequenti ...; “tribus annis sequentibus.” Alexandre,\r\nin Lemaire, i. 334.\r\n\r\n[363] corresponding to the 22nd of February.\r\n\r\n[364] a χελιδὼν, hirundo.\r\n\r\n[365] This will be either on March 2nd or on February 26th, according\r\nas we reckon from December the 21st, the real solstitial day, or the\r\n17th, when, according to the Roman calendar, the sun is said to enter\r\nCapricorn.\r\n\r\n[366] “quasi Avicularem dixeris.” Hardouin, in Lemaire, i. 334.\r\n\r\n[367] Corresponding to the 10th of May.\r\n\r\n[368] According to the Roman calendar, this corresponds to the 20th\r\nJuly, but, according to the text, to the 17th. Columella says, that the\r\nsun enters Leo on the 13th of the Calends of August; xi. 2.\r\n\r\n[369] “quasi præcursores;” Hardouin, in Lemaire, i. 335. Cicero refers\r\nto these winds in one of his letters to Atticus; xiv. 6.\r\n\r\n[370] ἐτησίαι, ab ἔτος, annus.\r\n\r\n[371] This will be on the 13th of September, as, according to our\r\nauthor, xviii. 24, the equinox is on the 24th.\r\n\r\n[372] This corresponds to the 11th of November; forty-four days before\r\nthis will be the 29th of September.\r\n\r\n[373] Or Halcyonides. This topic is considered more at length in a\r\nsubsequent part of the work; x. 47.\r\n\r\n[374] The author, as it appears, portions out the whole of the year\r\ninto fourteen periods, during most of which certain winds are said to\r\nblow, or, at least, to be decidedly prevalent. Although the winds of\r\nItaly are less irregular than those of England, Pliny has considerably\r\nexaggerated the real fact.\r\n\r\n[375] On this subject the reader may peruse the remarks of Seneca, Nat.\r\nQuæst. v. 18, written in his style of flowery declamation.\r\n\r\n[376] The greatest part of the remarks on the nature of the winds, in\r\nthis chapter, would appear to be taken from Aristotle’s Treatise De\r\nMeteor., and it may be stated generally, that our author has formed\r\nhis opinions more upon those of the Greek writers than upon actual\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n[377] 9 A.M.\r\n\r\n[378] In the last chapter Ornithias is said to be a west wind.\r\n\r\n[379] This obviously depends upon the geographical situation of the\r\nnorthern parts of Africa, to which the observation more particularly\r\napplies, with respect to the central part of the Continent and the\r\nMediterranean. See the remarks of Alexandre, in Lemaire, i. 340.\r\n\r\n[380] The influence of the fourth day of the moon is referred to by\r\nVirgil, Geor. i. 432 _et seq._ “Sin ortu quarto,” &c.\r\n\r\n[381] This refers to the genders of the names of the winds, analogous\r\nto the remark in note [346], p. 71.\r\n\r\n[382] Eudoxus was a native of Cnidus, distinguished for his knowledge\r\nin astrology and science generally; he was a pupil of Plato, and is\r\nreferred to by many of the ancients; see Hardouin’s Index Auctorum, in\r\nLemaire, i. 187, and Enfield’s Hist. of Phil. i. 412, with the very\r\ncopious list of references.\r\n\r\n[383] “flatus repentini.”\r\n\r\n[384] Cicero refers to an opinion very similar to this as maintained by\r\nthe Stoics; De Div. ii. 44.\r\n\r\n[385] “procella.”\r\n\r\n[386] “ἐκ νέφους, ex nube, erumpente spiritu.” Hardouin, in Lemaire, i.\r\n343. Perhaps it most nearly corresponds to the term “hurricane.”\r\n\r\n[387] a τύφω, incendo, ardeo. We have no distinct term in our language\r\nwhich corresponds to the account of the typhon; it may be considered as\r\na combination of a whirlwind and a hurricane.\r\n\r\n[388] Plutarch, Sympos. Quæst. iii. 5, refers to the extraordinary\r\npower of vinegar in extinguishing fire, but he ascribes this effect,\r\nnot to its coldness, but to the extreme tenuity of its parts. On this\r\nAlexandre remarks, “Melius factum negassent Plinius et Plutarchus, quam\r\ncausam inanem rei absurdissimæ excogitarent.” Lemaire, i. 344.\r\n\r\n[389] The terms here employed are respectively “turbines,” “presteres,”\r\nand “vortices.”\r\n\r\n[390] πρηστὴρ, a πρήθω, incendo. Seneca calls it “igneus turbo;” Nat.\r\nQuæst. v. 13. p. 762. See also Lucretius, vi. 423.\r\n\r\n[391] Plutarch.\r\n\r\n[392] A water-spout. We have a description of this phænomenon in\r\nLucretius, vi. 425 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[393] “fulmen.”\r\n\r\n[394] This has been pointed out by Alexandre, Lemaire, i. 346, as one\r\nof the statements made by our author, which, in consequence of his\r\nfollowing the Greek writers, applies rather to their climate than to\r\nthat of Italy. The reader may form a judgement of the correctness of\r\nthis remark by comparing the account given by Aristotle and by Seneca;\r\nthe former in Meteor. iii. 1. p. 573, 574, the latter in Nat. Quæst.\r\nii. 32 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[395] “fulgur.” The account of the different kinds of thunder seems\r\nto be principally taken from Aristotle; Meteor. iii. 1. Some of the\r\nphænomena mentioned below, which would naturally appear to the ancients\r\nthe most remarkable, are easily explained by a reference to their\r\nelectrical origin.\r\n\r\n[396] “quod clarum vocant.”\r\n\r\n[397] This account seems to be taken from Aristotle, Meteor. iii. 1. p.\r\n574; see also Seneca, Nat. Quæst. ii. 31. p. 711. We have an account of\r\nthe peculiar effects of thunder in Lucretius, vi. 227 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[398] This effect may be easily explained by the agitation into which\r\nthe female might have been thrown. The title of “princeps Romanarum,”\r\nwhich is applied to Marcia, has given rise to some discussion among the\r\ncommentators, for which see the remarks of Hardouin and Alexandre, in\r\nLemaire, i. 348.\r\n\r\n[399] Sometimes a partial thunder-cloud is formed, while the atmosphere\r\ngenerally is perfectly clear, or, as Hardouin suggests, the effect\r\nmight have been produced by a volcanic eruption. See Lemaire, i. 348.\r\n\r\n[400] Seneca gives us an account of the opinions of the Tuscans; Nat.\r\nQuæst. ii. 32; and Cicero refers to the “libri fulgurales” of the\r\nEtrurians; De Divin. i. 72.\r\n\r\n[401] According to Hardouin, “Summanus est Deus summus Manium, idem\r\nOrcus et Pluto dictus.” Lemaire, i. 349; he is again referred to by\r\nour author, xxix. 14; Ovid also mentions him, Fast. vi. 731, with the\r\nremark, “quisquis is est.”\r\n\r\n[402] The city of Bolsena is supposed to occupy the site of the ancient\r\nVolsinium. From the nature of the district in which it is situate,\r\nit is perhaps more probable, that the event alluded to in the test\r\nwas produced by a volcanic eruption, attended by lightning, than by a\r\nsimple thunder-storm.\r\n\r\n[403] “Vocant et familiaria ... quæ prima fiunt familiam suam cuique\r\nindepto.” This remark is explained by the following passage from\r\nSeneca; Nat. Quæst. ii. 47. “Hæc sunt fulmina, quæ primo accepto\r\npatrimonio, in novo hominis aut urbis statu fiunt.” This opinion, as\r\nwell as most of those of our author, respecting the auguries to be\r\nformed from thunder, is combated by Seneca; _ubi supra_, § 48.\r\n\r\n[404] This opinion is also referred to by Seneca in the following\r\npassage; “privata autem fulmina negant ultra decimum annum, publica\r\nultra trigesimum posse deferri;” _ubi supra_.\r\n\r\n[405] “in deductione oppidorum;” according to Hardouin, Lemaire, i.\r\n350, “quum in oppida coloniæ deducuntur.”\r\n\r\n[406] The following conjecture is not without a degree of probability;\r\n“Ex hoc multisque aliis auctorum locis, plerique conjiciunt Etruscis\r\nauguribus haud ignotam fuisse vim electricam, licet eorum arcana\r\nnunquam divulgata sint.” Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 350.\r\n\r\n[407] Alexandre remarks in this place, “An morbus aliquis fuit, qui\r\nprimum in agros debacchatus, jam urbi minabatur, forsitan ab aëris\r\nsiccitate natus, quem advenientes cum procella imbres discusserunt?”\r\nLemaire, i. 350.\r\n\r\n[408] For a notice of Piso, see Lemaire, i. 208.\r\n\r\n[409] We have an account of the death of Tullus Hostilius in Livy, i.\r\n31.\r\n\r\n[410] “ab eliciendo, seu quod precationibus cœlo evocaretur, id nomen\r\ntraxit.” This is confirmed by the following lines from Ovid, Fast. iii.\r\n327, 328:—\r\n\r\n  “Eliciunt cœlo te, Jupiter: unde minores\r\n    Nunc quoque te celebrant, Eliciumque vocant.”\r\n\r\n[411] “beneficiis abrogare vires.”\r\n\r\n[412] “ictum autem et sonitum congruere, ita modulante natura.” This\r\nremark is not only incorrect, but appears to be at variance both with\r\nwhat precedes and what follows.\r\n\r\n[413] The following remark of Seneca may be referred to, both as\r\nillustrating our author and as showing how much more correct the\r\nopinions of Seneca were than his own, on many points of natural\r\nphilosophy; “... necesse est, ut impetus fulminis et præmittat\r\nspiritus, et agat ante se, et a tergo trahat ventum....;” Nat. Quæst.\r\nlib. ii. § 20. p. 706.\r\n\r\n[414] “quoniam læva parte mundi ortus est.” On this passage Hardouin\r\nremarks; “a Deorum sede, quum in meridiem spectes, ad sinistram sunt\r\npartes mundi exorientes;” Lemaire, i. 353. Poinsinet enters into a\r\nlong detail respecting opinions of the ancients on this point and the\r\ncircumstances which induced them to form their opinions; i. 34 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[415] See Cicero de Divin. ii. 42.\r\n\r\n[416] “Junonis quippe templum fulmine violatum ostendit non a Jove, non\r\na Deis mitti fulmina.” Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 354. The consulate of\r\nScaurus was in the year of Rome 638. Lucan, i. 155, and Horace, Od. i.\r\n2. refer to the destruction of temples at Rome by lightning.\r\n\r\n[417] Obviously because faint flashes are more visible in the night.\r\n\r\n[418] We have an explanation of this peculiar opinion in Tertullian, as\r\nreferred to by Hardouin, Lemaire. i. 355; “Qui de cœlo tangitur, salvus\r\nest, ut nullo igne decinerescat.”\r\n\r\n[419] Although it has been thought necessary by M. Fée, in the notes to\r\nAjasson’s trans., ii. 384, 385, to enter into a formal examination of\r\nthis opinion of the author’s, I conceive that few of our readers will\r\nagree with him in this respect.\r\n\r\n[420] Suetonius informs us, that Augustus always wore a seal’s skin for\r\nthis purpose; Octavius, § 90.\r\n\r\n[421] The eagle was represented by the ancients with a thunderbolt in\r\nits claws.\r\n\r\n[422] There is strong evidence for the fact, that, at different\r\ntimes, various substances have fallen from the atmosphere, sometimes\r\napparently of mineral, and, at other times, of animal or vegetable\r\norigin. Some of these are now referred to those peculiar bodies termed\r\naërolites, the nature and source of which are still doubtful, although\r\ntheir existence is no longer so. These bodies have, in other instances,\r\nbeen evidently discharged from distant volcanoes, but there are many\r\ncases where the substance could not be supposed to have proceeded\r\nfrom a volcano, and where, in the present state of our knowledge,\r\nit appears impossible to offer an explanation of their nature, or\r\nthe source whence they are derived. We may, however, conclude,\r\nthat notwithstanding the actual occurrence of a few cases of this\r\ndescription, a great proportion of those enumerated by the ancients\r\nwere either entirely without foundation or much exaggerated. We meet\r\nwith several variations of what we may presume to have been aërolites\r\nin Livy; for example, xxiv. 10, xxx. 38, xli. 9, xliii. 13, and xliv.\r\n18, among many others. As naturally may be expected, we have many\r\nnarratives of this kind in Jul. Obsequens.\r\n\r\n[423] The same region from which lightning was supposed to proceed.\r\n\r\n[424] We have several relations of this kind in Livy, xxiv. 10, xxxix.\r\n46 and 56, xl. 19, and xliii. 13. The red snow which exists in certain\r\nalpine regions, and is found to depend upon the presence of the Uredo\r\nnivalis, was formerly attributed to showers of blood.\r\n\r\n[425] This occurrence may probably be referred to an aërolite, while\r\nthe wool mentioned below, i. e. a light flocculent substance, was\r\nperhaps volcanic.\r\n\r\n[426]\r\n\r\n  Armorum sonitum toto Germania cœlo\r\n  Audiit.—Virgil, Geor. i. 474, 475.\r\n\r\n“ ... in Jovis Vicilini templo, quod in Compsano agro est, arma\r\nconcrepuisse.” Livy, xxiv. 44.\r\n\r\n[427] See Plutarch, by Langhorne; Marius, iii. 133.\r\n\r\n[428] See Livy, iii. 5 & 10, xxxi. 12, xxxii. 9, _et alibi_.\r\n\r\n[429] I have already had occasion to remark, concerning this class of\r\nphænomena, that there is no doubt of their actual occurrence, although\r\ntheir origin is still unexplained.\r\n\r\n[430] The life of Anaxagoras has been written by Diogenes Laërtius. We\r\nhave an ample account of him by Enfield in the General Biography, _in\r\nloco_; he was born B.C. 500 and died B.C. 428.\r\n\r\n[431] There is some variation in the exact date assigned by different\r\nauthors to this event; in the Chronological table in Brewster’s Encyc.\r\nvi. 420, it is said to have occurred 467 B.C.\r\n\r\n[432] Aristotle gives us a similar account of this stone; that it fell\r\nin the daytime, and that a comet was then visible at night; Meteor.\r\ni. 7. It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the authority for this\r\nfact must be referred entirely to Aristotle, without receiving any\r\nadditional weight from our author. The occurrence of the comet at the\r\nsame time with the aërolite must have been entirely incidental.\r\n\r\n[433] “Deductis eo sacri lapidis causa colonis, extructoque oppido,\r\ncui nomen a colore adusto lapidis, est inditum, Potidæa. Est enim ποτὶ\r\nDorice πρὸς, ad, apud; δαίομαι, uror.” Hardouin, in Lemaire, i. 361. It\r\nwas situated in the peninsula of Pallene, in Macedonia.\r\n\r\n[434] The Vocontii were a people of Gallia Narbonensis, occupying a\r\nportion of the modern Dauphiné.\r\n\r\n[435] “Manifestum est, radium Solis immissum cavæ nubi, repulsa acie in\r\nSolem, refringi.”\r\n\r\n[436] Aristotle treats of the Rainbow much in detail, principally in\r\nhis Meteor. iii. 2, 3, 4, and 5, where he gives an account of the\r\nphænomena, which is, for the most part, correct, and attempts to form\r\na theory for them; see especially cap. 4. p. 577 _et seq._ In the\r\ntreatise De Mundo he also refers to the same subject, and briefly sums\r\nup his doctrine with the following remark: “arcus est species segmenti\r\nsolaris vel lunaris, edita in nube humida, et cava, et perpetua;\r\nquam velut in speculo intuemur, imagine relata in speciem circularis\r\nambitûs.” cap. 4. p. 607. Seneca also treats very fully on the\r\nphænomena and theory of the Rainbow, in his Nat. Quæst. i. 3-8.\r\n\r\n[437] _Vide supra_, also Meteor. iii. 2, and Seneca, Nat. Quæst. i. 3.\r\n\r\n[438] Aristotle, Meteor. iii. 5. p. 581, observes, that the rainbow is\r\nless frequently seen in the summer, because the sun is more elevated,\r\nand that, consequently, a less portion of the arch is visible. See also\r\nSeneca, Nat. Quæst. i. 8. p. 692.\r\n\r\n[439] Aristotle treats at some length of dew, snow, and hail, in his\r\nMeteor. i. cap. 10, 11 & 12 respectively.\r\n\r\n[440] When water is frozen, its bulk is increased in consequence of its\r\nassuming a crystalline structure. Any diminution which may be found\r\nto have taken place in the bulk of the fluid, when thawed, must be\r\nascribed to evaporation or to some accidental circumstance.\r\n\r\n[441] “Velini lacus ... præcipiti cursu in gurgitem subjectum defertur,\r\net illo aquarum lapsu, dispersis in aëra guttis humidis, ... iridis\r\nmultiplicis phænomenon efficit....” Alexandre, in Lemaire, i. 365.\r\n\r\n[442] We have an example in Martial, v. 34. 9, of the imprecation which\r\nhas been common in all ages:\r\n\r\n  Mollia nec rigidus cespes tegat ossa, nec illi\r\n    Terra gravis fueris;\r\n\r\nand in Seneca’s Hippolytus, _sub finem_:\r\n\r\n  ... istam terra defossam premat,\r\n  Gravisque tellus impio capiti incubet.\r\n\r\n[443] The author refers to this opinion, xxix. 23, when describing the\r\neffects of venomous animals.\r\n\r\n[444] inertium; “ultione abstinentium,” as explained by Alexandre, in\r\nLemaire, i. 367.\r\n\r\n[445] “Quod mortis genus a terræ meritis et benignitate valde\r\nabhorret.” Hardouin, in Lemaire, i. 367.\r\n\r\n[446] “Terra, inquit, sola est, e quatuor naturæ partibus sive\r\nelementis, adversus quam ingrati simus.” Alexandre, in Lemaire, i. 368.\r\n\r\n[447] “Est ironiæ formula. Quid, ait, feras et serpentes et venena\r\nterræ exprobramus, quæ ne ad tuendam quidem illam satis valent?”\r\nAlexandre, in Lemaire, i. 369.\r\n\r\n[448] “ossa vel insepulta cum tempore tellus occultat, deprimentia\r\npondere suo mollitam pluviis humum.” Alexandre, in Lemaire, i. 370.\r\n\r\n[449] “figura prima.” I may refer to the second chapter of this book,\r\nwhere the author remarked upon the form of the earth as perfect in all\r\nits parts, and especially adapted for its supposed position in the\r\ncentre of the universe.\r\n\r\n[450] “... si capita linearum comprehendantur ambitu;” the meaning of\r\nthis passage would appear to be: if the extremities of the lines drawn\r\nfrom the centre of the earth to the different parts of the surface were\r\nconnected together, the result of the whole would be a sphere. I must,\r\nhowever, remark, that Hardouin interprets it in a somewhat different\r\nmanner; “Si per extremitates linearum ductarum a centro ad _summos_\r\nquosque vertices montium circulus exigatur.” Lemaire, i. 370.\r\n\r\n[451] “... immensum ejus globum in formam orbis assidua circa eam mundi\r\nvolubilitate cogente.” As Hardouin remarks, the word _mundus_ is here\r\nused in the sense of _cœlum_. Lemaire, i. 371.\r\n\r\n[452] As our author admits of the existence of antipodes, and expressly\r\nstates that the earth is a perfect sphere, we may conclude that the\r\nresemblance to the cone of the pine is to be taken in a very general\r\nsense. How far the ancients entertained correct opinions respecting the\r\nglobular figure of the earth, or rather, at what period this opinion\r\nbecame generally admitted, it is perhaps not easy to ascertain. The\r\nlines in the Georgics, i. 242, 243, which may be supposed to express\r\nthe popular opinion in the time of Virgil, certainly do not convey the\r\nidea of a sphere capable of being inhabited in all its parts:\r\n\r\n  Hic vertex nobis semper sublimis; at illum\r\n  Sub pedibus Styx atra videt, manesque profundi.\r\n\r\n[453] “spiritus vis mundo inclusi.”\r\n\r\n[454] “... Alpium vertices, longo tractu, nec breviore quinquaginta\r\nmillibus passuum assurgere.” To avoid the apparent improbability of\r\nthe author conceiving of the Alps as 50 miles high, the commentators\r\nhave, according to their usual custom, exercised their ingenuity in\r\naltering the text. See Poinsinet, i. 206, 207, and Lemaire, i. 373. But\r\nthe expression does not imply that he conceived them as 50 miles in\r\nperpendicular height, but that there is a continuous ascent of 50 miles\r\nto get to the summit. This explanation of the passage is adopted by\r\nAlexandre; Lemaire, _ut supra_. For what is known of Dicæarchus I may\r\nrefer to Hardouin, Index Auctorum, in Lemaire, i. 181.\r\n\r\n[455] “coactam in verticem aquarum quoque figuram.”\r\n\r\n[456] “aquarum nempe convexitas.” Alexandre, in Lemaire, i. 374.\r\n\r\n[457] “Quam quæ ad extremum mare a primis aquis.” I profess myself\r\naltogether unable to follow the author’s mode of reasoning in this\r\nparagraph, or to throw any light upon it. He would appear to be arguing\r\nin favour of the actual flatness of the surface of the ocean, whereas\r\nhis previous remarks prove its convexity.\r\n\r\n[458] Alexandre remarks on this passage, “Nempe quod remotissimos etiam\r\nfontes alat oceanus. Sed omittit Plinius vaporationis intermedia ope\r\nhoc fieri.” Lemaire, i. 376. Aristotle has written at considerable\r\nlength on the origin of springs, in his Meteor. i. 13. p. 543 _et seq._\r\nHe argues against the opinion of those who suppose that the water of\r\nsprings is entirely derived from evaporation. Seneca’s account of the\r\norigin of springs is found in his Nat. Quæst. iii. 1.\r\n\r\n[459] The voyage which is here alluded to was probably that performed\r\nby Drusus; it is mentioned by Dio, lib. iv., Suetonius, Claud. § 1,\r\nVel. Paterculus, ii. 106, and by Tacitus, Germ. § 34.\r\n\r\n[460] What is here spoken of we may presume to have been that part of\r\nthe German Ocean which lies to the N.W. of Denmark; the term Scythian\r\nwas applied by the ancients in so very general a way, as not to afford\r\nany indication of the exact district so designated.\r\n\r\n[461] “Sub eodem sidere;” “which lies under the same star.”\r\n\r\n[462] The ancients conceived the Caspian to be a gulf, connected with\r\nthe northern ocean. Our author gives an account of it, vi. 15.\r\n\r\n[463] That is, of the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\n[464] The remarks which our author makes upon the Palus Mæotis, in the\r\ndifferent parts of his work, ii. 112 and vi. 7, appear so inconsistent\r\nwith each other, that we must suppose he indiscriminately borrowed\r\nthem from various writers, without comparing their accounts, or\r\nendeavouring to reconcile them to each other. Such inaccuracies may\r\nbe thought almost to justify the censure of Alexandre, who styles our\r\nauthor, “indiligens plane veri et falsi compilator, et ubi dissentiunt\r\nauctores, nunquam aut raro sibi constans.” Lemaire, i. 378.\r\n\r\n[465] The son of Agrippa, whom Augustus adopted. Hardouin, in Lemaire,\r\ni. 378.\r\n\r\n[466] See Beloe’s Herodotus, ii. 393, 394, for an account of the voyage\r\nround Africa that was performed by the Phœnicians, who were sent to\r\nexplore those parts by Necho king of Egypt.\r\n\r\n[467] It is generally supposed that C. Nepos lived in the century\r\nprevious to the Christian æra. Ptolemy Lathyrus commenced his reign\r\nU.C. 627 or B.C. 117, and reigned for 36 years. The references made to\r\nC. Nepos are not found in any of his works now extant.\r\n\r\n[468] We have previously referred to Eudoxus, note [382], p. 78.\r\n\r\n[469] We have a brief account of Antipater in Hardouin’s Index\r\nAuctorum; Lemaire, i. 162.\r\n\r\n[470] We are informed by Alexandre that this was in the year of the\r\nCity 691, the same year in which Cicero was consul; see note in\r\nLemaire, i. 379.\r\n\r\n[471] It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the account here given\r\nmust be incorrect; the reader who may be disposed to learn the opinions\r\nof the commentators on this point, may consult the notes in Poinsinet\r\nand Lemaire _in loco_.\r\n\r\n[472] Dividuo globo; “Eoas partes a vespertinis dividente oceano.”\r\nAlexandre in Lemaire, i. 380.\r\n\r\n[473] “Jam primum in dimidio computari videtur.”\r\n\r\n[474] “Cœlum;” the rigour of the climate.\r\n\r\n[475] The division of the globe into five zones is referred to by\r\nVirgil, Geor. i. 233-239, and by Ovid, Met. i. 45, 46.\r\n\r\n[476] “... interna maria allatrat, ...”\r\n\r\n[477] This is considerably more than the distance in the present day.\r\nThe Isthmus of Suez appears, according to the statement of the most\r\naccurate geographers, to be about 70 miles in breadth.\r\n\r\n[478] Hæ tot portiones terræ, as Alexandre correctly remarks, “ironice\r\ndictum. Quam paucæ enim supersunt!” Lemaire, i. 383.\r\n\r\n[479] “Mundi punctus.” This expression, we may presume, was taken from\r\nSeneca; “Hoc est illud punctum, quod inter tot gentes ferro et igni\r\ndividitur.” Nat. Quæst. i. præf. p. 681.\r\n\r\n[480] Nostro solo adfodimus; “addimus, adjungimus, annectimus, ut una\r\nfossione aretur.” Hardouin, in Lemaire, i. 383.\r\n\r\n[481] “Mundi totius.”\r\n\r\n[482] “Æquinoctii paribus horis.”\r\n\r\n[483] Dioptra. “Græce διόπτρα, instrumentum est geometricum, _un quart\r\nde cercle_, quo apparentes rerum inter se distantiæ anguli apertura\r\ndijudicantur.” Alexandre, in Lemaire, i. 384.\r\n\r\n[484] This title does not correspond with the contents of the chapter.\r\n\r\n[485] “Tropici duo, cum æquinoctiali circulo;” Hardouin, in Lemaire, i.\r\n384.\r\n\r\n[486] The Troglodytice of the ancients may be considered as nearly\r\ncorresponding to the modern Abyssinia and Nubia.\r\n\r\n[487] This remark is incorrect, as far as respects nearly the whole of\r\nEgypt; see the remarks of Marcus, in Ajasson, ii. 245.\r\n\r\n[488] This is a star of the first magnitude in the southern\r\nconstellation of Argo; we have a similar statement in Manilius, i. 216,\r\n217.\r\n\r\n[489] The commentators suppose that the star or constellation here\r\nreferred to cannot be the same with what bears this name on the modern\r\ncelestial atlas; vide Hardouin _in loco_, also Marc. in Ajasson, _ut\r\nsupra_. The constellation of Berenice’s hair forms the subject of\r\nCatullus’s 67th poem.\r\n\r\n[490] In Troglodytice and in Egypt.\r\n\r\n[491] The first watch of the night was from 6 P.M. to 9; the second\r\nfrom 9 to midnight.\r\n\r\n[492] According to Columella, xi. 2. 369, this was 9 Calend. Mart.,\r\ncorresponding to the 21st of February.\r\n\r\n[493] “In alia adverso, in alia prono mari.” I have adopted the opinion\r\nof Alexandre, who explains the terms “adverso” and “prono,” “ascendenti\r\nad polum,” and “ad austrum devexo;” a similar sense is given to the\r\npassage by Poinsinet and Ajasson, in their translations.\r\n\r\n[494] “Anfractu pilæ.” See Manilius, i. 206 _et seq._ for a similar\r\nmode of expression.\r\n\r\n[495] “Aut;” as Poinsinet remarks, “_aut_ est ici pour _alioqui_;” and\r\nhe quotes another passage from our author, xix. 3, where the word is\r\nemployed in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n[496] We may presume that the author meant to convey the idea, that\r\nthe eclipses which are visible in any one country are not so in those\r\nwhich are situated under a different meridian. The terms “vespertinos,”\r\n“matutinos,” and “meridianos,” refer not to the time of the day, but\r\nto the situation of the eclipse, whether recurring in the western,\r\neastern, or southern parts of the heavens.\r\n\r\n[497] Brewster, in the art. “Chronology,” p. 415, mentions this eclipse\r\nas having taken place Sept. 21st, U.C. 331, eleven days before the\r\nbattle of Arbela; while, in the same art. p. 423, the battle is said to\r\nhave taken place on Oct. 2nd, eleven days after a total eclipse of the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\n[498] It took place on the 30th of April, in the year of the City 811,\r\nA.D. 59; see Brewster, _ubi supra_. It is simply mentioned by Tacitus,\r\nAnn. xiv. 12, as having occurred among other prodigies which took place\r\nat this period.\r\n\r\n[499] We have an account of Corbulo’s expedition to Armenia in Dion\r\nCassius, lx. 19-24, but there is no mention of the eclipse or of any\r\npeculiar celestial phænomenon.\r\n\r\n[500] The terms employed in the original are “oppositu” and “ambitu.”\r\nAlexandre’s explanation of the first is, “quum globi terraquei\r\ncrassitudo interposita solis arcet radios;” and of the second, “quum\r\nnostra hujus globi pars a sole ambitur.” Lemaire, i. 389.\r\n\r\n[501] One of these towers is mentioned by Livy, xxxiii. 48; it is said\r\nto have been situated between Acholla and Thapsus, on the sea-coast.\r\n\r\n[502] Hardouin, according to his usual custom, employs all his\r\nlearning and ingenuity to give a plausible explanation of this\r\npassage. Alexandre, as it must be confessed, with but too much reason,\r\nremarks, “Frustra desudavit Harduinus ut sanum aliquem sensum ex illis\r\nPlinii deliramentis excuteret.” He correctly refers the interval\r\nof time, which was said to occur between these signals, not to any\r\nastronomical cause, but to the necessary delay which took place in the\r\ntransmission of them. He concludes, “Sed ad cursum solis hoc referre,\r\ndementiæ est. Nam ut tanta horarum differentia intersit, si moram\r\nomnem in speculandis ac transmittendis signis sustuleris, necesse\r\nerit observatores illos ultimos 135 gradibus, id est, sesquidimidio\r\nhemisphærio, a primis distare furribus. Recte igitur incredibilem\r\nPlinii credulitatem ludibrio vertit Baylius in Dictionario suo.”\r\nLemaire, i. 389.\r\n\r\n[503] The distance, as here stated, is about 150 miles, which he is\r\nsaid to have performed in nine hours, but that the same distance, in\r\nreturning, required fifteen hours. We have here, as on the former\r\noccasion, a note of Hardouin’s to elucidate the statement of the\r\nauthor. On this Alexandre observes, “Optime; sed in tam parva locorum\r\ndistantia, Elidis et Sicyonis horologia vix quinque unius horæ\r\nsexagesimis differre poterant; quare eunti ac redeunti ne discrimen\r\nquidem quadrantis horæ intererat. Ineptos igitur auctores sequitur hoc\r\nquoque loco Plinius.” Lemaire, i. 390, 391.\r\n\r\n[504] “Vincunt spatia nocturnæ navigationis.” This expression would\r\nappear to imply, that the author conceived some physical difficulty\r\nin sailing during the night, and so it seems to be understood by\r\nAlexandre; vide not. _in loco_.\r\n\r\n[505] “Vasa horoscopica.” “Vasa horoscopica appellat horologia in plano\r\ndescripta, horizonti ad libellam respondentia. Vasa dicuntur, quod area\r\nin qua lineæ ducebantur, labri interdum instar et conchæ erat, cujus in\r\nmargine describebantur horæ. Horoscopa, ab ὥρα et σκοπέω, hoc est, ab\r\ninspiciendis horis.” Hardouin, in Lemaire, i. 391.\r\n\r\n[506] These distances are respectively about 38 and 62 miles.\r\n\r\n[507] We are not to expect any great accuracy in these estimates, and\r\nwe accordingly find, that our author, when referring to the subject in\r\nhis 6th book, ch. 39, makes the shadow at Ancona 1/35 greater than the\r\ngnomon, while, in Venetia, which is more northerly, he says, as in the\r\npresent chapter, that the shadow and the gnomon are equal in length.\r\nSee the remarks of M. Alexandre in Lemaire, _ut supra_.\r\n\r\n[508] This would be about 625 miles. Strabo, ii. 114, and Lucan, ii.\r\n587, give the same distance, which is probably nearly correct. Syene\r\nis, however, a little to the north of the tropic.\r\n\r\n[509] This remark is not correct, as no part of this river is between\r\nthe tropics. For an account of Onesicritus see Lemaire, i. 203, 204.\r\n\r\n[510] “In meridiem umbras jaci.” M. Ajasson translates this passage,\r\n“les ombres tombent pendant quatre-vingt-dix jours sur le point central\r\ndu méridien.” ii. 165. But I conceive that Holland’s version is more\r\ncorrect, “for 90 days’ space all the shadows are cast into the south.”\r\ni. 36. The remarks of M. Alexandre are to the same effect; “... ut bis\r\nsolem in zenitho haberet (Ptolemais), Maii mensis et Augusti initio;\r\ninterea vero, solem e septemtrione haberet.” Lemaire, i. 393.\r\n\r\n[511] About 625 miles.\r\n\r\n[512] These days correspond to the 8th of May and the 4th of August\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n[513] There is considerable uncertainty respecting the identity of this\r\nmountain; our author refers to it in a subsequent part of his work,\r\nwhere it is said to be in the country of the Monedes and Suari; vi. 22.\r\nSee the note of Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 394.\r\n\r\n[514] Our author, in a subsequent part of his work, vi. 23, describes\r\nthe island of Patale as situated near the mouth of the Indus; he again\r\nrefers to it, xii. 25. His account of the position of the sun does not,\r\nhowever, apply to this place.\r\n\r\n[515] If we may suppose this to have been actually the case, we might\r\ncalculate the time of the year when Alexander visited this place and\r\nthe length of his stay.\r\n\r\n[516] We may presume, that our author means to say no more than that,\r\nin those places, they are occasionally invisible; literally the\r\nobservation would not apply to any part of India.\r\n\r\n[517] ἄσκια, shadowless.\r\n\r\n[518] If this really were the case, it could have no relation to the\r\nastronomical position of the country.\r\n\r\n[519] “In contrarium,” contrary to what takes place at other times,\r\n_i. e._ towards the south. This observation is not applicable to the\r\nwhole of this country, as its northern and southern parts differ from\r\neach other by seven or eight degrees of latitude. For an account of\r\nEratosthenes see Lemaire, i. 186.\r\n\r\n[520] “Hora duodecim in partes, ut as in totidem uncias dividebatur.\r\nOctonas igitur partes horæ antiquæ, sive bessem, ut Martianus vocat,\r\nnobis probe repræsentant horarum nostratium 40 sexagesimæ, quas minutas\r\nvocamus.” Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 396.\r\n\r\n[521] For a notice of Pytheas see Lemaire, i. 210. He was a geographer\r\nand historian who lived in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus; but\r\nhis veracity does not appear to have been highly estimated by his\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\n[522] The Thule of Pliny has been generally supposed to be the Shetland\r\nIsles. What is here asserted respecting the length of the day, as well\r\nas its distance from Britain, would indeed apply much more correctly\r\nto Iceland than to Shetland; but we have no evidence that Iceland was\r\nknown to the ancients. Our author refers to the length of the day in\r\nThule in two subsequent parts of his work, iv. 30 and vi. 36.\r\n\r\n[523] Supposed to be Colchester in Essex; while the Mona of Pliny\r\nappears to have been Anglesea. It is not easy to conceive why the\r\nauthor measured the distance of Mona from Camelodunum.\r\n\r\n[524] Chap. 6 of this book.\r\n\r\n[525] a σκιὰ, umbra, and θηράω, sector. It has been a subject for\r\ndiscussion by the commentators, how far this instrument of Anaximenes\r\nis entitled to the appellation of a dial, whether it was intended to\r\nmark the hours, or to serve for some other astronomical purpose. See\r\nHardouin in Lemaire, i. 398, 399. It has been correctly remarked by\r\nBrotier, that we have an account of a much more ancient dial in the 2nd\r\nbook of Kings, xx. 9, 11.\r\n\r\n[526] A. Gellius, iii. 3, informs us, that the question concerning\r\nthe commencement of the day was one of the topics discussed by Varro,\r\nin his book “Rerum Humanarum:” this work is lost. We learn from the\r\nnotes of Hardouin, Lemaire, i. 399, that there are certain countries in\r\nwhich all these various modes of computation are still practised; the\r\nlast-mentioned is the one commonly employed in Europe.\r\n\r\n[527] It has been supposed, that in this passage the author intended\r\nto say no more than that the nights are shorter at the summer solstice\r\nthan at the other parts of the year; see Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 399,\r\n400. But to this, I conceive, it may be objected, that the words “inter\r\nortus solis” can scarcely apply to the period while the sun is below\r\nthe horizon, and that the solstices generally would seem to be opposed\r\nto the equinoxes generally. Also the words “obliquior” and “rectior”\r\nwould appear to have some farther reference than merely to the length\r\nof time during which the sun is above or below the horizon.\r\n\r\n[528] “Vibrato;” the same term is applied by Turnus to the hair of\r\nÆneas; Æn. xii. 100.\r\n\r\n[529] “Mobilitate hebetes;” it is not easy to see the connexion between\r\nthese two circumstances.\r\n\r\n[530] There is a passage in Galen, De Temperamentis, iii. 6, which may\r\nappear to sanction the opinion of our author; “Siccos esse, quibus\r\nmacra sunt crura; humidos, quibus crassa.”\r\n\r\n[531] The latter part of the remark is correct, but the number of\r\nferocious animals is also greater in the warmer regions; there is, in\r\nfact, a greater variety in all the productions of nature in the warmer\r\ndistricts of the globe, except in those particular spots where animal\r\nor vegetable life is counteracted by some local circumstances, as in\r\nmany parts of Asia and Africa by the want of water.\r\n\r\n[532] “Sensus liquidus;” Alexandre explains this expression, “judicium\r\nsanum, mens intelligendo apta.” Lemaire, i. 401.\r\n\r\n[533] Saturn, Jupiter and Mars: see the 8th chapter of this book.\r\n\r\n[534] “Vel quando meant cum Sole in conjunctione cum eo, vel quando\r\ncum eo conveniunt in aspectu, maxime vero in quadrato, qui fit, quum\r\ndistant a Sole quarta mundi sive cœli parte.” Hardouin in Lemaire, i.\r\n401.\r\n\r\n[535] “Ut urbem et tecta custodirent.” This anecdote is referred to by\r\nCicero, who employs the words “ut urbem et tecta linquerent.” De Divin.\r\ni. 112.\r\n\r\n[536] This anecdote is also referred to by Cicero, de Div. ii.\r\n\r\n[537] It has been observed that earthquakes, as well as other great\r\nconvulsions of nature, are preceded by calms; it has also been observed\r\nthat birds and animals generally exhibit certain presentiments of the\r\nevent, by something peculiar in their motions or proceedings; this\r\ncircumstance is mentioned by Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 8, and by Seneca,\r\nNat. Quæst. vi. 12.\r\n\r\n[538] It is scarcely necessary to remark, that this supposed\r\nresemblance or analogy is entirely without foundation. The phænomena of\r\nearthquakes are described by Aristotle, De Mundo, cap. 4, and Meteor.\r\nii. 7 and 8; also by Seneca in various parts of the 6th book of his\r\nQuæst. Nat.\r\n\r\n[539] On this subject we shall find much curious matter in Aristotle’s\r\nTreatise de Mundo, cap. 4.\r\n\r\n[540] Poinsinet enters into a long detail of some of the most\r\nremarkable earthquakes that have occurred, from the age of Pliny to the\r\nperiod when he wrote, about fifty years ago; i. 249. 2.\r\n\r\n[541] See Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 8.\r\n\r\n[542] See Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 8, and Seneca, Nat. Quæst. vi. 13.\r\n\r\n[543] “Fervente;” “Fremitum aquæ ferventis imitante.” Alexandre in\r\nLemaire, i. 404.\r\n\r\n[544] The reader will scarcely require to be informed, that many of the\r\nremarks in the latter part of this chapter are incorrect. Our author\r\nhas principally followed Aristotle, whose treatise on meteorology,\r\nalthough abounding in curious details, is perhaps one of the least\r\ncorrect of his works.\r\n\r\n[545] This observation is taken from Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 8.\r\n\r\n[546] Phænomena of this kind have been frequently noticed, and are not\r\ndifficult of explanation.\r\n\r\n[547] “In iisdem;” “Iidem, inquit, putei inclusum terra spiritum libero\r\nmeatu emittentes, terræ motus avertunt.” Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 406.\r\n\r\n[548] “Quæ pendent.” M. Ajasson translates this passage, “qui sont\r\ncomme suspendues.” Hardouin’s explanation is, “Structis fornice cameris\r\nimposita ædificia intelligit; quod genus camerarum spiramenta plerumque\r\nhabet non pauca, quibus exeat ad libertatem aer.” Lemaire, i. 407.\r\n\r\n[549] Many of these circumstances are referred to by Seneca, Nat.\r\nQuæst. vi. 30. On the superior security of brick buildings, M.\r\nAlexandre remarks, “Muri e lateribus facti difficilius quam cæteri\r\ndehiscunt, unde fit ut in urbibus muniendis id constructionum genus\r\nplerumque præferatur. Ex antiquæ Italiæ palatiis templisve nihil fere\r\npræter immensas laterum moles hodie superest.”\r\n\r\n[550] These remarks upon the different kinds of shocks are probably\r\ntaken from Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 8.\r\n\r\n[551] This observation is also in Aristotle, ii. 8.\r\n\r\n[552] In the year of the city 663; A.C. 90.\r\n\r\n[553] In the year of the city 821; A.D. 68.\r\n\r\n[554] The continuation of Aufidius Bassus’ history; our author refers\r\nto it in the first book.\r\n\r\n[555] We have no authentic accounts of this mutual change of place\r\nbetween two portions of land, nor can we conceive of any cause capable\r\nof effecting it. Our author mentions this circumstance again in book\r\nxvii. ch. 38.\r\n\r\n[556] See Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 8.\r\n\r\n[557] “Eodem videlicet spiritu infusi (maris) ac terræ residentis sinu\r\nrecepti.”\r\n\r\n[558] U.C. 770; A.D. 17. We have an account of this event in Strabo,\r\nxii. 57; in Tacitus, Ann. ii. 47; and in the Universal History,\r\nxiv. 129, 130. We are informed by Hardouin, that coins are still in\r\nexistence which were struck to commemorate the liberality of the\r\nemperor on the occasion, inscribed “civitatibus Asiæ restitutis.”\r\nLemaire, i. 410.\r\n\r\n[559] U.C. 537; A.C. 217.\r\n\r\n[560] This circumstance is mentioned by Livy, xxii. 5, and by Floras,\r\nii. 6.\r\n\r\n[561] “Præsagiis, inquit, quam ipsa clade, sæviores sunt terræ motus.”\r\nAlexandre in Lemaire, i. 410.\r\n\r\n[562] This phænomenon is distinctly referred to by Seneca, Nat. Quæst.\r\nvi. 21. It presents us with one of those cases, where the scientific\r\ndeductions of the moderns have been anticipated by the speculations of\r\nthe ancients.\r\n\r\n[563] Odyss. iv. 354-357; see also Arist. Meteor. i. 14; Lucan, x.\r\n509-511; Seneca, Nat. Quæst. vi. 26; Herodotus, ii. 4, 5; and Strabo,\r\ni. 59.\r\n\r\n[564] These form, at this day, the Monte Circello, which, it is\r\nremarked, rises up like an island, out of the Pontine marshes. It\r\nseems, however, difficult to conceive how any action of the sea could\r\nhave formed these marshes.\r\n\r\n[565] See Strabo, i. 58.\r\n\r\n[566] ii. 5. _et alibi_.\r\n\r\n[567] The plain in which this river flows, forming the windings from\r\nwhich it derives its name, appears to have been originally an inlet of\r\nthe sea, which was gradually filled up with alluvial matter.\r\n\r\n[568] “Paria secum faciente natura.” This appears to have been a\r\ncolloquial or idiomatic expression among the Romans. See Hardouin in\r\nLemaire, i. 412.\r\n\r\n[569] It may be remarked, that the accounts of modern travellers and\r\ngeologists tend to confirm the opinion of the volcanic origin of many\r\nof the islands of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n[570] Brotier remarks, that, according to the account of Herodotus,\r\nthis island existed previous to the date here assigned to it; Lemaire,\r\ni. 412, 413: it is probable, however, that the same name was applied to\r\ntwo islands, one at least of which was of volcanic origin.\r\n\r\n[571] U.C. 517, A.C. 237; and U.C. 647, A.C. 107; respectively.\r\n\r\n[572] Hiera, Automata; ab ἱερὰ, sacer, et αὐτομάτη, sponte nascens.\r\nRespecting the origin of these islands there would appear to be some\r\nconfusion in the dates, which it is difficult to reconcile with each\r\nother; it is, I conceive, impossible to decide whether this depends\r\nupon an error of our author himself, or of his transcribers.\r\n\r\n[573] July 25th, U.C. 771; A.C. 19.\r\n\r\n[574] U.C. 628; A.C. 125.\r\n\r\n[575] See Ovid, Metam. xv. 290, 291; also Seneca, Nat. Quæst. vi. 29.\r\n\r\n[576] This event is mentioned by Thucydides, lib. 3, Smith’s Trans, i.\r\n293; and by Diodorus, xii. 7, Booth’s Trans. p. 287, as the consequence\r\nof an earthquake; but the separation was from Locris, not from Eubœa.\r\nSee the remarks of Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 415.\r\n\r\n[577] It is somewhat uncertain to what island our author applied this\r\nname; see the remarks of Alexandre in Lemaire.\r\n\r\n[578] See Ovid, Metam. xv. 287.\r\n\r\n[579] It is not improbable, from the situation and geological structure\r\nof the places here enumerated, that many of the changes mentioned above\r\nmay have actually occurred; but there are few of them of which we have\r\nany direct evidence.\r\n\r\n[580] This celebrated narrative of Plato is contained in his Timæus,\r\nOp. ix. p. 296, 297; it may be presumed that it was not altogether a\r\nfiction on the part of the author, but it is, at this time, impossible\r\nto determine what part of it was derived from ancient traditions and\r\nwhat from the fertile stores of his own imagination. It is referred\r\nto by various ancient writers, among others by Strabo. See also the\r\nremarks of Brotier in Lemaire, i. 416, 417.\r\n\r\n[581] Many of these changes on the surface of the globe, and others\r\nmentioned by our author in this part of his work, are alluded to by\r\nOvid, in his beautiful abstract of the Pythagorean doctrine, Metam. xv.\r\n_passim_.\r\n\r\n[582] See Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 8, and Strabo, i. For some account of\r\nthe places mentioned in this chapter the reader may consult the notes\r\nof Hardouin _in loco_.\r\n\r\n[583] Poinsinet, as I conceive correctly, makes the following clause\r\nthe commencement of the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[584] See Ovid, Metam. xv. 293-295; also the remarks of Hardouin in\r\nLemaire, i. 418.\r\n\r\n[585] “Spatium intelligit, fretumve, quo Sicilia nunc ab Italia\r\ndispescitur.” Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 419.\r\n\r\n[586] See Strabo, ix.\r\n\r\n[587] “Spiracula.”\r\n\r\n[588] “Busta urbium.”\r\n\r\n[589] “Suboriens,” as M. Alexandre explains it, “renascens;” Lemaire,\r\ni. 420.\r\n\r\n[590] “Scrobibus;” “aut quum terra fossis excavatur, ut in Pomptina\r\npalude, aut per naturales hiatus.” Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 420.\r\n\r\n[591] This circumstance is mentioned by Seneca, Nat. Quæst. vi. 28,\r\nas occurring “pluribus Italiæ locis;” it may be ascribed to the\r\nexhalations from volcanos being raised up into the atmosphere. It does\r\nnot appear that there is, at present, any cavern in Mount Soracte which\r\nemits mephitic vapours. But the circumstance of Soracte being regarded\r\nsacred to Apollo, as we learn from our author, vii. 2, and from Virgil,\r\nÆn. xi. 785, may lead us to conjecture that something of the kind may\r\nformerly have existed there.\r\n\r\n[592] The author may probably refer to the well-known Grotto del Cane,\r\nwhere, in consequence of a stratum of carbonic acid gas, which occupies\r\nthe lower part of the cave only, dogs and other animals, whose mouths\r\nare near the ground, are instantly suffocated.\r\n\r\n[593] Celebrated in the well-known lines of Virgil, Æn. vii. 563 _et\r\nseq._, as the “sævi spiracula Ditis.”\r\n\r\n[594] Apuleius gives us an account of this place from his own\r\nobservation; De Mundo, § 729. See also Strabo, xii.\r\n\r\n[595] See Aristotle, De Mundo, cap. iv.\r\n\r\n[596] “Ad ingressum ambulantium, et equorum cursus, terræ quoque\r\ntremere sentiuntur in Brabantino agro, quæ Belgii pars, et circa S.\r\nAudomari fanum.” Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 421, 422.\r\n\r\n[597] See Seneca, Nat. Quæst. iii. 25.\r\n\r\n[598] Martial speaks of the marshy nature of the Cæcuban district,\r\nxiii. 115. Most of the places mentioned in this chapter are illustrated\r\nby the remarks of Hardouin; Lemaire, i. 422, 423.\r\n\r\n[599] “Saltuares.” In some of the MSS. the term here employed is\r\nSaliares, or Saltares; but in all the editions which I am in the habit\r\nof consulting, it is Saltuares.\r\n\r\n[600] There is, no doubt, some truth in these accounts of floating\r\nislands, although, as we may presume, much exaggerated. There are\r\nfrequently small portions of land detached from the edges of lakes, by\r\nfloods or rapid currents, held together and rendered buoyant by a mass\r\nof roots and vegetable matter. In the lake of Keswick, in the county\r\nof Cumberland, there are two small floating islands, of a few yards in\r\ncircumference, which are moved about by the wind or by currents; they\r\nappear to consist, principally, of a mass of vegetable fibres.\r\n\r\n[601] It has been observed, that there are certain places where bodies\r\nremain for a long time without undergoing decomposition; it depends\r\nprincipally upon a dry and cool condition of the air, such as is\r\noccasionally found in vaults and natural caverns. See the remarks of\r\nAlexandre in Lemaire, i. 424.\r\n\r\n[602] We may conceive of a large mass of rock being so balanced upon\r\nthe fine point of another rock, as to be moved by the slightest touch;\r\nbut, that if it be pushed with any force, it may be thrown upon a plane\r\nsurface, and will then remain immovable.\r\n\r\n[603] Perhaps the author may refer to some kind of earth, possessed\r\nof absorbent or astringent properties, like the Terra Sigillata or\r\nArmenian Bole of the old Pharmacopœias.\r\n\r\n[604] A σὰρξ, caro, and φάγω, edo. We may conceive this stone to have\r\ncontained a portion of an acrid ingredient, perhaps of an alkaline\r\nnature, which, in some degree, might produce the effect here described.\r\nIt does not appear that the material of which the stone coffins are\r\ncomposed, to which this name has been applied, the workmanship of which\r\nis so much an object of admiration, are any of them possessed of this\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n[605] Alexandre remarks on this statement, “Montes istæ videntur\r\noriginem dedisse fabulæ quæ in Arabicis Noctibus legitur ...;” Lemaire,\r\ni. 425. Fouché, indeed, observes, that there are mountains composed\r\nprincipally of natural loadstone, which might sensibly attract a shoe\r\ncontaining iron nails. Ajasson, ii. 386. But I conceive that we have no\r\nevidence of the existence of the magnetic iron pyrites having ever been\r\nfound in sufficient quantity to produce any sensible effect of the kind\r\nhere described.\r\n\r\n[606] We may remark generally, that of the “miracula” related in this\r\nchapter, the greatest part are entirely without foundation, and the\r\nremainder much exaggerated.\r\n\r\n[607] “Mundo;” the heavens or visible firmament, to which the stars and\r\nplanets appear to be connected, so as to be moved along with it.\r\n\r\n[608] “Ancillante;” “Credas ancillari sidus, et indulgere mari, ut non\r\nab eadem parte, qua pridie, pastum ex oceano hauriat.” Hardouin in\r\nLemaire, i. 427.\r\n\r\n[609] Not depending on the time of the rising and setting of the sun\r\nor the latitude of the place, but determinate portions of the diurnal\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[610] By a conjectural variation of a letter, viz. by substituting\r\n“eos” for “eas,” Dalechamp has, as he conceives, rendered this passage\r\nmore clear; the alteration is adopted by Lemaire.\r\n\r\n[611] “In iisdem ortus occasusque operibus;” “Eodem modo utrinque\r\norientibus occidentibusque sideribus,” as interpreted by Alexandre in\r\nLemaire, i. 428.\r\n\r\n[612] It is scarcely necessary to remark, that both the alleged fact\r\nand the supposed cause are incorrect. And this is the case with what\r\nour author says in the next sentence, respecting the period of eight\r\nyears, and the hundred revolutions of the moon.\r\n\r\n[613] “Solis annuis causis.” The circumstances connected with the\r\nrevolution of the sun, acting as causes of the period and height of the\r\ntides, in addition to the effect of the moon.\r\n\r\n[614] “Inanes;” “Depressiores ac minus tumentes.” Hardouin in Lemaire,\r\ni. 429.\r\n\r\n[615] According to the remark of Alexandre, “Uno die et dimidio altero,\r\n36 circiter horis, in Gallia.” Lemaire, i. 429.\r\n\r\n[616] Alexandre remarks on this passage, “Variat pro locis hoc\r\nintervallum a nullo fere temporis momento ad undecim horas et amplius;”\r\nLemaire, i. 429.\r\n\r\n[617] Our author has already referred to Pytheas, in the 77th chapter\r\nof this book.\r\n\r\n[618] It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the space here\r\nmentioned, which is nearly 120 feet, is far greater than the actual\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n[619] “Ditioni paret;” “Lunæ solisque efficientiæ, quæ ciet æstum.”\r\nHardouin in Lemaire, i. 430.\r\n\r\n[620] The effect here described could not have depended upon the tides,\r\nbut upon some current, either affecting the whole of the Mediterranean,\r\nor certain parts of it. See the remarks of Hardouin in Lemaire.\r\n\r\n[621] Pliny naturally adopted the erroneous opinions respecting the\r\nstate of the blood-vessels, and the cause of the pulse, which were\r\nuniversally maintained by the ancients.\r\n\r\n[622] The name of Euripus is generally applied to the strait between\r\nBœotia and Eubœa, but our author here extends it to that between Italy\r\nand Sicily. A peculiarity in the tide of this strait is referred to by\r\nCicero, De Nat. Deor. iii. 24.\r\n\r\n[623] “Æstus idem triduo in mense consistit.” “Consistentia, sive\r\nmediocritas aquarum non solum septima die sentitur, sed et octava, ac\r\nnona durat,” as Hardouin explains this passage, Lemaire, i. 431.\r\n\r\n[624] Now called the Guadalquivir.\r\n\r\n[625] The modern Seville.\r\n\r\n[626] This circumstance is noticed by most of the ancients, as by\r\nAristotle, Meteor. ii. 1; by Seneca, Nat. Quæst. iv. 2; and by Strabo.\r\nIt has, however, no relation to the tide, but depends upon the quantity\r\nof water transmitted into the Euxine by the numerous large rivers that\r\nempty themselves into it.\r\n\r\n[627] It has been suggested, with some plausibility, that the greater\r\nheight of the tides at this period will cause a greater quantity of\r\nmatter to be cast on shore. This circumstance is referred to by Seneca,\r\nNat. Quæst. iii. 26; and by Strabo.\r\n\r\n[628] Alexandre observes on this supposed fact, “Algarum molles\r\nquædam species intelligendæ sunt, quæ convolutæ et marcidæ in littus\r\nejiciuntur.” Lemaire, i. 432.\r\n\r\n[629] It may cause some surprise to find that such an opinion has been\r\nentertained even in modern times; but more correct observation has\r\nshown it to be without foundation. Lemaire.\r\n\r\n[630] “Spiritus sidus;” “Quod vitalem humorem ac spiritus in corporibus\r\nrebusque omnibus varie temperet.” Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 433.\r\n\r\n[631] “Terras saturet;” as Alexandre interprets it, “succo impleat;”\r\nLemaire.\r\n\r\n[632] This circumstance is alluded to by Cicero, De Divin. ii. 33, and\r\nby Horace, Sat. ii. 4, 30. It is difficult to conceive how an opinion\r\nso totally unfounded, and so easy to refute, should have obtained\r\ngeneral credence.\r\n\r\n[633] Lib. xviii. chap. 75.\r\n\r\n[634] Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 1, remarks, that as the sun is continually\r\nevaporating the water of the sea, it must eventually be entirely\r\ndried up. But we have reason to believe, that all the water which is\r\nevaporated by the solar heat, or any other natural process, is again\r\ndeposited in the form of rain or dew.\r\n\r\n[635] “Terræ sudor;” according to Aristotle, Meteor. ii. 4: this\r\nopinion was adopted by some of the ancients.\r\n\r\n[636] The commentators discuss at considerable length the relative\r\nmerits of the three hypotheses here proposed, to account for the\r\nsaltness of the ocean; all of which are equally unfounded. See Hardouin\r\nin Lemaire, i. 434, 435. Aristotle’s opinion on this subject is\r\ncontained in his Meteor.\r\n\r\n[637] It is not easy to ascertain the origin of the very general\r\nopinion respecting the peculiar physical action of the moon. The\r\nalleged facts are, for the most part, without foundation, and I am\r\nnot aware of any circumstance which could, originally, have made them\r\na part of the popular creed of so many nations, ancient as well as\r\nmodern. Perhaps some of the effects which have been ascribed to the\r\nspecific action of the moon, may be explained by the lower temperature\r\nand greater dampness of the air, during the absence of the sun.\r\n\r\n[638] There appears to be some doubt respecting the history of the\r\nperson here referred to: according to the account of Hardouin, Fabianus\r\nwas a naturalist, who enjoyed a high reputation; he lived in the time\r\nof Tiberius: see Lemaire, i. 188.\r\n\r\n[639] This would be a depth of 3125 yards, not very far short of two\r\nmiles; see Adam’s Rom. Antiq. p. 503.\r\n\r\n[640] “Βαθέα Ponti;” Aristotle refers to this as one of those parts\r\nwhere the sea is unfathomable; Meteor. i. 13.\r\n\r\n[641] A distance of nearly nine and a half miles.\r\n\r\n[642] The specific gravity of sea water varies from 1·0269 to 1·0285.\r\nThe saline contents of the water of the English Channel are stated to\r\nbe 27 grs. in 1000. Turner’s Chem. p. 1289, 1290.\r\n\r\n[643] The modern names of the rivers and lakes here mentioned are the\r\nLiris, communicating with the Lago di Celano; the Adda, with the Lago\r\ndi Como; the Ticino, with the Lago Maggiore; the Mincio, with the Lago\r\ndi Guarda; the Oglio, with the Lago di Sero; and the Rhone with the\r\nLake of Geneva. There may be some foundation for the alleged fact,\r\nbecause the specific gravity and the temperature of the lake may differ\r\na little from that of the river which passes through it.\r\n\r\n[644] According to Brotier, “fons ille olim nobilissimus, nunc ignobile\r\nest lavacrum, cujus aqua marino sapore inficitur.” He conceives that\r\nthere is no actual foundation for this so frequently repeated story;\r\nand conjectures that it originated from the similitude of the names,\r\nthe fountain in Sicily and the river in the Peloponnesus being both\r\nnamed Alpheus. He goes on to mention some examples of springs of fresh\r\nwater rising up on the sea-coast; Lemaire, i. 438. The allusion to\r\nthe fountain of Arethusa, by Virgil, in the commencement of the 10th\r\neclogue, is well known to all classical scholars. The lines of Virgil\r\nhave been elegantly imitated by Voltaire, in the Henriade, ix. 269, 270.\r\n\r\n[645] This is mentioned by Ovid, Met. xv. 273, 274.\r\n\r\n[646] This is again referred to by our author, vi. 31; also by Strabo,\r\nand by Seneca, Nat. Quæst. iii. 26.\r\n\r\n[647] Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[648] The river here referred to is the Tanager, the modern Rio Negro.\r\nSee the remarks of Hardouin and Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 439.\r\n\r\n[649] From a note in Poinsinet, i. 302, we learn that there has been\r\nsome doubt respecting the locality of this river. It is mentioned by\r\nVirgil, Æn. i. 244, and it forms the subject of Heyne’s 7th Excursus,\r\nii. 124 _et seq._ Virgil also speaks of the Timavus, Ec. viii. 6; and\r\nHeyne, in a note, gives the following description of it: “Timavus in\r\nora Adriæ, non longe ab Aquileia fluvius ex terra novem fontibus seu\r\ncapitibus progressus, brevi cursu, in unum alveum collectus, lato\r\naltoque flumine in mare exit.” i. 127, 128.\r\n\r\n[650] This remark is not to be taken in its full extent; the water of\r\nthese lakes contains a large quantity of saline and other substances\r\ndissolved in it, and, consequently, has its specific gravity so much\r\nincreased, that various substances float on it which sink in pure water.\r\n\r\n[651] According to Hardouin, this is now called the Lake of Andoria,\r\nnear the town of Casalnuovo; Lemaire, i. 439. Poinsinet calls it\r\nAnduria, i. 303.\r\n\r\n[652] The petrifying quality of this river is referred to by Ovid, Met.\r\nxv. 313, 314; Seneca quotes these lines when treating on this subject,\r\nNat. Quæst. iii. 20.\r\n\r\n[653] Aristotle, Strabo, and Silius Italicus, viii. 582, 583, refer to\r\nthis property of the Silarus; but, according to Brotier, it does not\r\nappear to be known to the present inhabitants of the district through\r\nwhich it flows. Lemaire, i. 440.\r\n\r\n[654] In a subsequent part of the work, xxxi. 8, our author remarks,\r\n“Reatinis tantum paludibus ungulas jumentorum indurari.” We may presume\r\nthat the water contained some saline, earthy or metallic substance,\r\neither in solution, or in a state of minute division, which would\r\nproduce these effects. It does not appear that anything of this kind\r\nhas been observed by the moderns in this water.\r\n\r\n[655] The coral beds with which the Red Sea abounds may have given\r\nrise to this opinion: see the remarks of Alexandre _in loco_. Hardouin\r\ninforms us, that this clause respecting the Red Sea is not found in\r\nany of the MSS. Lemaire, i. 441. A similar observation occurs in a\r\nsubsequent part of the work, xiii. 48.\r\n\r\n[656] There are thermal springs in the Alpine valleys, but not any in\r\nthe elevated parts of the Alps themselves.\r\n\r\n[657] The volcanic nature of a large portion of the south of Italy\r\nand the neighbouring islands may be regarded as the cause of the warm\r\nsprings which are found there.\r\n\r\n[658] This river may be supposed to have been principally supplied by\r\nmelted snow; it would appear to be colder, because its temperature\r\nwould be less elevated than the other streams in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[659] The statement, if correct, may be referred to the discharge of a\r\nquantity of inflammable gas from the surface of the water. The fact is\r\nmentioned by Lucretius, vi. 879, 880, and by Mela.\r\n\r\n[660] “Quasi alternis requiescens, ac meridians: diem diffindens, ut\r\nVarro loquitur, insititia quiete.” Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 443. He says\r\nthat there is a similar kind of fountain in Provence, called Collis\r\nMartiensis.\r\n\r\n[661] There has been considerable difference of opinion among\r\nthe commentators, both as to the reading of the text and its\r\ninterpretation, for which I shall refer to the notes of Poinsinet,\r\ni. 307, of Hardouin and Alexandre, Lemaire, i. 443, and of Richelet,\r\nAjasson, ii. 402.\r\n\r\n[662] We have an account of the Troglodytæ in a subsequent part of the\r\nwork, v. 5. The name is generally applied by the ancients to a tribe\r\nof people inhabiting a portion of Æthiopia, and is derived from the\r\ncircumstance of their dwellings being composed of caverns; a τρωγλὴ\r\nand δύνω. Alexandre remarks, that the name was occasionally applied\r\nto other tribes, whose habitations were of the same kind; Lemaire, i.\r\n443. They are referred to by Q. Curtius as a tribe of the Æthiopians,\r\nsituated to the south of Egypt and extending to the Red Sea, iv. 7.\r\n\r\n[663] Q. Curtius gives nearly the same account of this fountain.\r\n\r\n[664] The Po derives its water from the torrents of the Alps, and is\r\ntherefore much affected by the melting of the snow or the great falls\r\nof rain, which occur at different seasons of the year; but the daily\r\ndiminution of the water, as stated by our author, is without foundation.\r\n\r\n[665] “Fontem ibi intermittentem frustra quæsivit cl. Le Chevalier,\r\nVoyage de la Troade, t. i. p. 219.” Lemaire, i. 444.\r\n\r\n[666] Strabo, in allusion to this circumstance, remarks, that some\r\npersons make it still more wonderful, by supposing that this spring\r\nis connected with the Nile. We learn from Tournefort, that there is a\r\nwell of this name in Delos, which he found to contain considerably more\r\nwater in January and February than in October, and which is supposed to\r\nbe connected with the Nile or the Jordan: this, of course, he regards\r\nas an idle tale. Lemaire.\r\n\r\n[667] Hardouin informs us, that these warm springs are called “i bagni\r\ndi Monte Falcone,” or “di S. Antonio.” They are situate so very near\r\nthe sea, that we may suppose some communication to exist, which may\r\nproduce the alleged effect. Lemaire.\r\n\r\n[668] According to Hardouin this is the modern Torre di Pitino; he\r\nconceives that the river here mentioned must be the Vomanus. The effect\r\nhere described is, to a certain extent, always the case with rivers\r\nwhich proceed from mountains that are covered with snow. Lemaire, i.\r\n445.\r\n\r\n[669] Seneca, Nat. Quæst. iii. 25, makes the same remark: the fact\r\nwould seem to be, that in certain districts the cattle are found to\r\nbe for the most part white, and in other places black; but we have no\r\nreason to suppose that their colour has any connexion with the water\r\nwhich they employ.\r\n\r\n[670] This is asserted by Aristotle, Hist. Anim. iii. 12. We have a\r\nsimilar statement made by Ælian respecting the Scamander; viii. 21.\r\n\r\n[671] “Annonæ mutationem significans.”\r\n\r\n[672] The peculiar nature of the water of the Lyncestis is referred\r\nto by many of the ancients: we may suppose that it was strongly\r\nimpregnated with carbonic acid gas. See Ovid, Met. xv. 329-331; also\r\nAristotle, Meteor. ii. 3, and Seneca, Nat. Quæst. iii. 20.\r\n\r\n[673] Vitruvius and Athenæus.\r\n\r\n[674] Calenum was a town in Campania; this peculiar property of its\r\nwater is referred to by Val. Maximus, i. 8, 18.\r\n\r\n[675] Literally, Jovis cultus; as interpreted by Hardouin, “tanquam si\r\ndixeris, divinum Jovis munus hunc fontem esse.” Lemaire, i. 447.\r\n\r\n[676] Seneca affirms its poisonous nature; Nat. Quæst. iii. 25.\r\nQ. Curtius refers to a spring in Macedonia of the same name, “quo\r\npestiferum virus emanat.” x. 10.\r\n\r\n[677] There appears to be some uncertainty respecting the locality of\r\nthis district; see the remarks of Hardouin, Lemaire, i. 447.\r\n\r\n[678] “Hunc fontem describit eximie Plinius jun. lib. iv. epist. ult.\r\nEst ad orientalem Larii lacus plagam, Lago di Como, x mill. pass. a\r\nComo.” Hardouin, Lemaire, i. 448.\r\n\r\n[679] Our author, in a subsequent passage, v. 39, speaks of Cydonea,\r\n“cum fonte calido.”\r\n\r\n[680] According to Hardouin, i. 448, there is a considerable variation\r\nin the MSS. with respect to this name: he informs us that “Συναὸς urbs\r\nest Magnæ Phrygiæ Ptolemæo, v. 2.”\r\n\r\n[681] Tacitus gives an account of this oracle as having been visited by\r\nGermanicus; Ann. ii. 54.\r\n\r\n[682] Our author refers to this history in the First book of the\r\npresent work.\r\n\r\n[683] “Comparatos scilicet cum aëris externi temperie.” Alexandre in\r\nLemaire, i. 448.\r\n\r\n[684] Thin leaves or films of metal have little affinity for water, and\r\nhave, generally, bubbles of air attached to them; so that, when placed\r\nupon the water, the fluid is prevented from adhering to them, and thus\r\nthey remain on the surface.\r\n\r\n[685] Depending not upon their absolute, but their specific gravity.\r\n\r\n[686] Being partly supported by the water.\r\n\r\n[687] The stone may have floated in consequence of its being full of\r\npores: these are more quickly filled with water when it is broken into\r\nsmall pieces. It was probably of the nature of pumice or some other\r\nvolcanic product.\r\n\r\n[688] This is well known to depend upon the commencement of the\r\ndecomposition of some part of the viscera, by which there is an\r\nevolution of gaseous matter.\r\n\r\n[689] This is an erroneous statement; it is not easy to ascertain what\r\nwas the source of the error.\r\n\r\n[690] Rain, as it falls from the clouds, is nearly pure; and rivers, or\r\nreceptacles of any kind, that are supplied by it, are considerably more\r\nfree from saline impregnations than the generality of springs.\r\n\r\n[691] This statement is altogether incorrect.\r\n\r\n[692] When salt water freezes, it is disengaged from the saline matter\r\nwhich it previously held in solution; a greater degree of cold is\r\ntherefore required to overcome the attraction of the water for the\r\nsalt, and to form the ice, than when pure water is congealed.\r\n\r\n[693] “Celerius accendi.” We can scarcely suppose that by this term\r\nour author intended to express the actual burning or inflaming of the\r\nwater, which is its literal and ordinary meaning. This, however, would\r\nappear to be the opinion of Hardouin and Alexandre; Lemaire, i. 449.\r\nHolland translates it, “made hot and set a-seething,” i. 46; Poinsinet,\r\n“s’échauffe le plus vîte,” i. 313; and Ajasson, “plus prompte à\r\ns’échauffer,” ii. 217.\r\n\r\n[694] The temperature of the ocean, in consequence of its great\r\nmass and the easy diffusion and mixture of its various parts, may\r\nbe conceived to be longer in becoming raised or depressed than any\r\nparticular portion of the land, where contemporary observations may be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n[695] The evaporation that is going on during the heats of summer, and\r\nthe heavy rains which in many countries fall during the autumn, may\r\nproduce the effects here described, in confined seas or inlets.\r\n\r\n[696] The statement is true to a certain extent, as is proved by the\r\nwell-known experiments of Franklin and others; but the degree of the\r\neffect is considerably exaggerated. See the observations of Hardouin,\r\nBrotier, and Alexandre; Lemaire, i. 450, 451.\r\n\r\n[697] In the Mediterranean the warm vapours rising from the water and\r\nits shores may melt the snow as it descends; but this is not the case\r\nin the parts of the main ocean which approach either to the Arctic or\r\nthe Antarctic regions.\r\n\r\n[698] The theory of springs is well understood, as depending upon\r\nthe water tending to rise to its original level, so as to produce an\r\nequilibrium of pressure.\r\n\r\n[699] When we consider the great extent of the base of Ætna, and that\r\nthe crater is in the form of an inverted cone, we shall perceive that\r\nthere is ample space for the existence of springs in the lower part of\r\nthe mountain, without their coming in contact with the heated lava.\r\n\r\n[700] Samosata is situated on the Euphrates, in the north of Syria.\r\n\r\n[701] The Petroleum or Bitumen of the modern chemists; it is a tarry\r\nsubstance, more or less fluid, which has probably been produced by\r\ncarbonaceous matter, as affected by heat or decomposition, below the\r\nsurface of the earth. Our author has exaggerated its properties and\r\naction upon other bodies.\r\n\r\n[702] Respecting the transaction here mentioned, I shall refer to the\r\nnote of Hardouin, Lemaire, i. 452.\r\n\r\n[703] The substance here mentioned may be considered as not differing\r\nessentially from the Maltha of the last chapter, except in being of a\r\nmore fluid consistence.\r\n\r\n[704] The Astaceni are supposed to have inhabited a district near the\r\nsources of the Indus, probably corresponding to the modern Cabul.\r\n\r\n[705] We may conceive of a quantity of inflammable vapour on the\r\nsurface of the naphtha, which might, in some degree, produce the effect\r\nhere described.\r\n\r\n[706] Horace, in one of his Epodes, where he refers to the magical arts\r\nof Medea, says, that it was a cloak, “palla,” which was sent to Creüsa;\r\nv. 65. So far as there is any foundation for the story, we may suppose\r\nthat some part of her dress had been impregnated with an inflammable\r\nsubstance, which took fire when she approached the blazing altar.\r\n\r\n[707] When the volcanos are less active the flame is visible in the\r\nnight only.\r\n\r\n[708] The observations of modern travellers and geologists have proved,\r\nthat the number of extinct volcanos is considerably greater than those\r\nnow in action.\r\n\r\n[709] Chimæra was a volcano in Lycia, not far from the Xanthus; the\r\ncircumstance of its summit emitting flame, while its sides were the\r\nresort of various savage animals, probably gave rise to the fabulous\r\nstory of the Centaur of this name, a ferocious monster who was\r\ncontinually vomiting forth flame.\r\n\r\n[710] The word in the text is “fœnum”; Hardouin suggests that the\r\nmeaning of the author may have been litter, or the refuse of stables.\r\nLemaire, i. 454.\r\n\r\n[711] The emission of a gas, which may be kindled by the application of\r\nflame, is a phænomenon of no very rare occurrence; but the effects are,\r\nno doubt, much exaggerated. See the remarks of Alexandre in Lemaire, i.\r\n454.\r\n\r\n[712] The country of the Bactrians was a district to the S.E. of the\r\nCaspian Sea, and to the north of the sources of the Indus, nearly\r\ncorresponding to the modern Bucharia.\r\n\r\n[713] There would appear to be some uncertainty as to the locality of\r\nthis place: our author derived his statement from the writer of the\r\ntreatise de Mirab. Auscult.\r\n\r\n[714] “Caminis.”\r\n\r\n[715] Probably the crater of a former volcano.\r\n\r\n[716] This mountain, as well as the Θεῶν ὄχημα mentioned below, has\r\nbeen supposed to be situated on the west of Africa, near Sierra Leone,\r\nor Cape Verd; but, as I conceive, without sufficient authority. See\r\nAlexandre in Lemaire, i. 455.\r\n\r\n[717] “Internus.” “In interiore nemore abditus.” Hardouin in Lemaire,\r\ni. 455.\r\n\r\n[718] If this account be not altogether fabulous, the appearance here\r\ndescribed may be, perhaps, referred to the combustion of an inflammable\r\ngas which does not acquire a very high temperature.\r\n\r\n[719] We have an account of this place in Strabo, vii. 310. Our author\r\nhas already referred to it in the 96th chapter of this book, as a pool\r\nor lake, containing floating islands; and he again speaks of it in the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\n[720] We have an account of this volcano in Ælian, Var. Hist. xiii. 16.\r\nIt would appear, however, that it had ceased to emit flame previous to\r\nthe calamitous events of which it was supposed to be the harbinger.\r\n\r\n[721] This circumstance is mentioned by Dion Cassius, xli. 174. We may\r\nconceive that a sudden influx of water might force up an unusually\r\nlarge quantity of the bitumen.\r\n\r\n[722] We have a full account of this circumstance in Strabo, vi. 277.\r\n\r\n[723] “Currum deorum Latine licet interpretari.” Hardouin in Lemaire,\r\ni. 456.\r\n\r\n[724] “torrentesque solis ardoribus flammas egerit;” perhaps the author\r\nmay mean, that the fires of the volcano assist those of the sun in\r\nparching the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\n[725] “Tot rogis terræ?” in reference to the remark in a former\r\nchapter, “natura terras cremat.”\r\n\r\n[726] “Humani ignes,” according to Hardouin, “Hi nostri ignes, quos\r\nvitæ usus requirit, ut Tullius ait de Nat. Deor. ii. 67;” Lemaire, i.\r\n457.\r\n\r\n[727] This is the mode which many savage tribes employ for exciting\r\nflame.\r\n\r\n[728] It is not known whether the Scantia was a river or a lake, or\r\nwhere it was situated; see Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 457.\r\n\r\n[729] This may have been owing to the emission of an inflammable gas\r\nwhich burns at a comparatively low temperature, as was observed on a\r\nformer occasion.\r\n\r\n[730] These are said by Columella, xi. 3, to occur in August; the\r\nstatement as to the fire occurring on these particular days we may\r\npresume is erroneous.\r\n\r\n[731] Aricia was a town in Campania, near the modern Lake of Nemi:\r\nthis place, as well as the other places mentioned by our author, were\r\nprobably of volcanic origin.\r\n\r\n[732] Sidicinum was a town in Campania, also called Teanum; probably\r\nthe modern Teano.\r\n\r\n[733] Egnatia was a town in Calabria, on the coast of the Adriatic: the\r\ncircumstance mentioned by our author is ridiculed by Horace, in his\r\nwell-known lines, Sat. i. 5, 97; but it is not improbable that there\r\nmay be some foundation for it.\r\n\r\n[734] This circumstance is referred to by Val. Maximus, i. 8, 18. The\r\naltar was probably in the neighbourhood of the Lacinian Promontory,\r\nat the S.W. extremity of the Bay of Tarentum, the modern Capo delle\r\nColonne.\r\n\r\n[735] This may be referred to the inflammable vapours mentioned above,\r\nunless we regard the whole narrative as fabulous.\r\n\r\n[736] See Livy, i. 39, and Val. Maximus, i. 6. 2. Although it would\r\nbe rash to pronounce this occurrence and the following anecdotes\r\nrespecting Marcius to be absolutely impossible, we must regard them as\r\nhighly improbable, and resting upon very insufficient evidence.\r\n\r\n[737] In the 66th chapter of this book.\r\n\r\n[738] In the estimate of distances I have given the numbers as they\r\noccur in the text of Lemaire, although, in many cases, there is\r\nconsiderable doubt as to their accuracy. See the observations of\r\nHardouin and Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 460.\r\n\r\n[739] Artemidorus was an Ephesian, who wrote on geography; see\r\nHardouin’s Index Auct., Lemaire, i. 167.\r\n\r\n[740] Isidorus was a native of Nicæa; he appears to have been a writer\r\non various topics in natural history, but not much estimated; see\r\nHardouin’s Index Auct., in Lemaire, i. 194.\r\n\r\n[741] The modern Cape St. Vincent and Cape Finisterre.\r\n\r\n[742] This was a city on the Sinus Issicus, the present Gulf of Aiasso,\r\nsituated, according to Brotier, between the sites of the modern towns\r\nof Scanderoon and Rosos. See Lemaire, i. 461.\r\n\r\n[743] Respecting this and the other distances mentioned in this\r\nchapter, I may refer the reader to the remarks of Hardouin in Lemaire,\r\ni. 461.\r\n\r\n[744] It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the calculations of our\r\nauthor do not indicate the real distance between the extreme points of\r\nthe habitable parts of the globe, as known to the ancients, but the\r\nnumber of miles which must be passed over by a traveller, in going from\r\nplace to place; in the first instance, a considerable part of the way\r\nby sea, and, in the second, almost entirely by land.\r\n\r\n[745] It appears to be difficult to ascertain the identity of the place\r\nhere mentioned; I may refer to the remarks of Hardouin and Brotier in\r\nLemaire, i. 464.\r\n\r\n[746] The same remarks may be made upon this and the following numbers\r\nas upon those in the former paragraph; for further information I shall\r\nrefer my readers to the notes of Hardouin, Brotier, and Alexandre, in\r\nLemaire, i. 465-468.\r\n\r\n[747] There is great uncertainty respecting the locality of the Thule\r\nof the ancients; there was, in fact, nothing known respecting the\r\nlocality or identity of any of the places approaching to the Arctic\r\ncircle; the name appears to have been vaguely applied to some country\r\nlying to the north of the habitable parts of Europe. In note [522], p. 109,\r\nI have already had occasion to offer some remarks on the locality of\r\nThule. Our author speaks of Thule in two subsequent parts of his work,\r\niv. 30 and vi. 39.\r\n\r\n[748] It is probable, that these supposed “immense islands,” if they\r\nwere not entirely imaginary, were the countries of Sweden and Norway,\r\nthe southern extremities alone of which had been visited by the\r\nancients.\r\n\r\n[749] Strabo, ii.; Vitruvius, i. 6; Macrobius, in Somn. Scip. ii. 20.\r\n\r\n[750] Our author has previously referred to Eratosthenes, in the 76th\r\nchapter of this book.\r\n\r\n[751] Our author has referred to Hipparchus, in the 9th chapter of this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n[752] “Aliter, inquit, et cautius multo Dionysodorus est audiendus, qui\r\nmiraculo solo nititur, quam Hipparchus et Eratosthenes, qui geometricis\r\nnituntur principiis.” Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 469. Nothing further is\r\nknown of Dionysodorus; see Hardouin’s Index Auct. in Lemaire, i. 123.\r\n\r\n[753] Marcus Terentius Varro. He was born B.C. 116, espoused the cause\r\nof Pompey against Cæsar, and served as his lieutenant in Spain. He\r\nafterwards became reconciled to Cæsar, and died in the year B.C. 26.\r\nHe is said to have written 500 volumes, but nearly all his works are\r\nlost (destroyed, it is said, by order of Pope Gregory VII.). His only\r\nremains are a Treatise on Agriculture, a Treatise on the Latin Tongue,\r\nand the fragments of a work called _Analogia_.\r\n\r\n[754] C. Sulpicius Gallus was Consul in the year 166 B.C. He wrote a\r\nRoman History, and a work on the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon.\r\n\r\n[755] Titus Vespasianus, the Emperor, to whom Pliny dedicates his work.\r\nHis poem is mentioned in c. 22 of this Book. See pages 1, 2, and 55 of\r\nthe present volume.\r\n\r\n[756] It is most probable that Quintus Ælius Pætus Tubero is here\r\nmeant. He was son-in-law, and, according to Cicero, nephew of Æmilius\r\nPaulus, and Consul in the year B.C. 167. There are two other persons\r\nfound mentioned of the name of Q. Ælius Tubero.\r\n\r\n[757] The freedman and amanuensis of Cicero. He was a man of great\r\nlearning, and was supposed to have invented short-hand. He also wrote a\r\nLife of Cicero.\r\n\r\n[758] Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi. He was Consul in the year B.C. 133,\r\nand was a stout opponent of the Gracchi. He wrote Annals of the History\r\nof Rome from the earliest periods.\r\n\r\n[759] Livy, the well-known Roman historian.\r\n\r\n[760] He was the intimate friend of Cicero, and wrote Chronicles or\r\nAnnals, in three books, a Life of Cicero, and some other historical\r\nworks. A work still exists, called “Lives of Eminent Commanders,” which\r\nis ascribed sometimes to him and sometimes to one Æmilius Probus, a\r\nwriter of the reign of Theodosius. The latter probably abridged the\r\noriginal work of Nepos.\r\n\r\n[761] Statius Sebosus. He is mentioned by Cicero as the friend of\r\nCatulus. He wrote a work called the “Periplus,” and another on the\r\nWonders of India.\r\n\r\n[762] A Roman historian and lawyer, who flourished about B.C. 124. He\r\nwrote a Book of Annals, in which was contained a valuable account of\r\nthe Second Punic war. This work was epitomized by Brutus and held in\r\nhigh estimation by the Emperor Adrian.\r\n\r\n[763] Fabianus Papirius, a Roman rhetorician and naturalist, whose\r\nworks are highly commended by Pliny and Seneca. He wrote a History of\r\nAnimals, and a book on Natural Causes.\r\n\r\n[764] Quintus Valerius Antias. He flourished about B.C. 80, and wrote\r\nthe Annals of Rome, down to the time of Sylla.\r\n\r\n[765] Marcus Licinius Crassus Mucianus. He was instrumental in raising\r\nthe Emperor Vespasian to the throne, and was Consul in the years A.D.\r\n52, 70, and 74. He published three Books of Epistles, and a History in\r\neleven Books, which appears to have treated chiefly of Eastern affairs.\r\n\r\n[766] Aulus Cæcina. He was sent into exile by Cæsar, joined the\r\nPompeians in Africa, and was taken prisoner by Cæsar, but his life\r\nwas spared. Cicero wrote several letters to him, and commends his\r\nabilities. His work appears to have been on Divination as practised by\r\nthe Etrurians.\r\n\r\n[767] He appears to have been a diviner or soothsayer of Etruria, and\r\nto have written a work on Etruscan prodigies.\r\n\r\n[768] He also wrote a work on Etruscan divination, but it does not\r\nappear that any thing further is known of him.\r\n\r\n[769] Sergius Paulus. He is also mentioned in the Index to the 18th\r\nBook. Nothing further seems to be known of him.\r\n\r\n[770] The greatest, with the exception of Aristotle, of the Greek\r\nPhilosophers, and the disciple of Socrates.\r\n\r\n[771] A native of Nicæa in Bithynia, who flourished B.C. 160. He\r\nis called the “Father” of Astronomy. He wrote a Commentary on the\r\nPhænomena of Aratus and Eudoxus, which is still extant. His works,\r\nincluding those on the Lunar Month and the Fixed Stars, have not come\r\ndown to us. His Catalogue of the Stars is preserved in the Almagest of\r\nPtolemy.\r\n\r\n[772] Timæus of Locri in Italy, a Pythagorean philosopher, said to have\r\nbeen the instructor of Plato. He wrote a work on Mathematics. A work\r\n“On the Soul of the World and of Nature,” which is still extant, has\r\nbeen ascribed to him, but on doubtful grounds.\r\n\r\n[773] An astronomer and peripatetic philosopher of Alexandria. He was\r\nemployed by Julius Cæsar to superintend his revision of the Calendar.\r\nIt is supposed that he wrote a work on the Celestial Revolutions, and a\r\nCommentary on the works of Aristotle.\r\n\r\n[774] A priest, mathematician, and astrologer of Egypt. A Letter on\r\nthe Astrological Sciences, written by him to King Necepsos, is said to\r\nbe extant in the Royal Library at Vienna, as also a work called the\r\n“Organum Astrologicum,” dedicated to the same king. Juvenal seems to\r\nuse his name as a common term for an astrologer.\r\n\r\n[775] He is mentioned by Julius Firmicus as “a most just emperor of\r\nEgypt, and a very good astronomer.” A work by him is quoted by Galen in\r\nhis tenth Book on Simples, but it was most probably of spurious origin.\r\n\r\n[776] “Pythagoricis” here may either mean the works of the followers\r\nof Pythagoras of Samos, or the books which were written by that\r\nphilosopher. Pliny, in Books 19, 20, and 24, speaks of several writings\r\nof Pythagoras, and Diogenes Laertius mentions others; but it is more\r\ngenerally supposed that he wrote nothing, and that everything that\r\npassed by his name in ancient times was spurious.\r\n\r\n[777] A Stoic philosopher of Apamea in Syria. He was the instructor\r\nof Cicero, and the friend of Pompey. He wrote works on history,\r\ndivination, the tides, and the nature of the gods. Some fragments only\r\nhave survived.\r\n\r\n[778] Of Miletus, was born B.C. 610, and was the successor of Thales,\r\nthe founder of the Ionian school of philosophy. He is said to have\r\nfirst taught the obliquity of the ecliptic and the use of the gnomon.\r\n\r\n[779] A philosopher of Rhodes or Byzantium. Seneca says that he boasted\r\nof having studied astronomy among the Chaldeans. He is mentioned by\r\nVarro and Columella as having written on rural matters, and is praised\r\nby Censorinus.\r\n\r\n[780] Of Alexandria, the great geometrician, and instructor of Ptolemy\r\nI. He was the founder of the mathematical school of Alexandria.\r\n\r\n[781] He was a Greek by birth, and lived in the time of Nero. He is\r\nextolled by Tacitus, B. 14, for his superlative wisdom, beyond which\r\nnothing is known of him.\r\n\r\n[782] Of Cnidus, an astronomer and legislator who flourished B.C. 366.\r\nHe was a friend and disciple of Plato, and said to have been the first\r\nwho taught in Greece the motions of the planets. His works on astronomy\r\nand geometry are lost, but his Phænomena have been preserved by Aratus,\r\nwho turned his prose into verse.\r\n\r\n[783] Born at Abdera in Thrace, about B.C. 460. He was one of the\r\nfounders of the atomic theory, and looked upon peace of mind as\r\nthe _summum bonum_ of mortals. He wrote works on the nature and\r\norganization of the world, on physics, on contagious maladies, on the\r\nchameleon, and on other subjects.\r\n\r\n[784] A Grecian astronomer. A work of his, called “Apotelesmatica,” is\r\nsaid to be preserved in the Imperial Library at Vienna.\r\n\r\n[785] An astrologer of Rhodes, patronized by Augustus and Tiberius. He\r\nwrote a work on Stones, and a History of Egypt. Tacitus, in his Annals,\r\nB. vi., speaks highly of his skill in astrology.\r\n\r\n[786] A geographer of Antioch, and an opponent of the views of\r\nEratosthenes. Cicero declares that he himself was unable to understand\r\na thousandth part of his work.\r\n\r\n[787] A Peripatetic philosopher and geographer, of Messina in Sicily.\r\nHe studied under Aristotle and wrote several works, the principal of\r\nwhich was an account of the history, geography, and moral and religious\r\ncondition of Greece. A few fragments only are extant.\r\n\r\n[788] Of Syracuse, the most famous mathematician of antiquity, born\r\nB.C. 287. A few only of his works have come down to us, published at\r\nOxford in 1792, by Torelli.\r\n\r\n[789] Born either at Astypalæa or Ægina. He was chief pilot of the\r\nfleet of Alexander during the descent of the Indus and the voyage to\r\nthe Persian Gulf. He wrote a work called the “Alexandropædia,” or\r\nEducation of Alexander. In his description of what he saw in India,\r\nmany fables and falsehoods are said to have been interwoven, so much\r\nso that the work (which is now lost) is said to have resembled a fable\r\nmore than a history.\r\n\r\n[790] Of Cyrene, born B.C. 276. He was invited from Athens by Ptolemy\r\nEuergetes, to become keeper of the library at Alexandria. He was a man\r\nof most extensive erudition, as an astronomer, geographer, philosopher,\r\nhistorian and grammarian. All of his writings have perished, with the\r\nexception of a few fragments on geographical subjects.\r\n\r\n[791] Of Massilia, now Marseilles, a celebrated navigator who\r\nflourished about the time of Alexander the Great. In his voyages he\r\nvisited Britain and Thule, of which he probably gave some account\r\nin his work “On the Ocean.” He has been wrongfully accused of\r\nfalsehood by Strabo. Another work written by him was his “Periplus,”\r\nor ‘Circumnavigation’ from Gades to the Tanais, probably, in this\r\ninstance, the Elbe.\r\n\r\n[792] Of Halicarnassus, the father of Grecian history; born B.C. 484.\r\nBesides his great work which has come down to us, he is supposed to\r\nhave written a history of Arabia.\r\n\r\n[793] Probably the most learned of the Greek philosophers. His works\r\nwere exceedingly numerous, and those which have survived to us treat\r\nof natural history, metaphysics, physical science, ethics, logic, and\r\ngeneral literature.\r\n\r\n[794] A native of Cnidus in Caria, and private physician to Artaxerxes\r\nMnemon, having been made prisoner by him at the battle of Cunaxa. He\r\nwrote a History of Persia in 23 books, which, with the exception of\r\na small abridgement by Photius and a few fragments, is now lost. He\r\nalso wrote a book on India. He was much censured, probably without\r\nsufficient reason, for the credulity displayed in his works.\r\n\r\n[795] Of Ephesus, a geographer, who lived about B.C. 100. He wrote a\r\nPeriplus, and a work on Geography; a few fragments only of abridgements\r\nof these have survived.\r\n\r\n[796] Of Charax in Parthia, of which country he wrote an account which\r\nstill exists. He flourished in the reign of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[797] Of Chios, a celebrated historian, and disciple of the orator\r\nIsocrates. His principal works were a History of Greece, and a Life of\r\nPhilip of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n[798] Now the Straits of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[799] This is said more especially in reference to the western parts\r\nof Asia, the only portion which was perfectly known to the ancients.\r\nHis meaning is, that Asia as a portion of the globe does not lie so far\r\nnorth as Europe, nor so far south as Africa.\r\n\r\n[800] Now the Don. It was usually looked upon as the boundary between\r\nEurope and Asia. Pliny’s meaning seems to be, that the Tanais divides\r\nAsia from Europe, and the Nile, Asia from Africa, the more especially\r\nas the part to the west of the Nile was sometimes considered as\r\nbelonging to Asia. It has been however suggested that he intends to\r\nassign these rivers as the extreme eastern boundaries of the internal\r\nor Mediterranean sea.\r\n\r\n[801] At no spot are the Straits less than ten miles in width; although\r\nD’Anville makes the width to be little less than five miles. This\r\npassage of our author is probably in a corrupt state.\r\n\r\n[802] This probably stood near the site of the town of Tarifa of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n[803] Probably the point called ‘Punta del Sainar’ at the present day.\r\n\r\n[804] Now called Ximiera, Jebel-el-Mina, or Monte del Hacho.\r\n\r\n[805] The Rock of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[806] The fable was that they originally formed one mountain, which was\r\ntorn asunder by Hercules, or as Pliny says, “dug through.”\r\n\r\n[807] This was the opinion of Herodotus, but it had been so strenuously\r\ncombated by Polybius and other writers before the time of Pliny, that\r\nit is difficult to imagine how he should countenance it.\r\n\r\n[808] He probably alludes to Leucopetra, now called Capo dell’ Armi.\r\nLocri Epizephyrii was a town of Bruttium, situate north of the\r\npromontory of Zephyrium, now called Capo di Bruzzano.\r\n\r\n[809] So called from the Bætis, now the Guadalquivir or Great River.\r\n\r\n[810] The situation of this town is not known, but it is supposed to\r\nhave been about five leagues from the present city of Mujacar, or\r\nMoxacar. It was situate on the Sinus Urgitanus.\r\n\r\n[811] So called from the city of Tarraco, on the site of the present\r\nTarragona.\r\n\r\n[812] Corresponding nearly in extent with the present kingdom of\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\n[813] Now Gaudiana, a corruption of the Arabic Wadi Ana, “the river\r\nAna.”\r\n\r\n[814] According to Hardouin this place is the modern town of Montiel,\r\nbut Pinet and D’Anville make it the same as Alhambra.\r\n\r\n[815] According to modern writers it conceals itself in this manner for\r\na distance of fifteen miles.\r\n\r\n[816] From the Balearic Channel to the Gulf of Gascony or Bay of Biscay.\r\n\r\n[817] Probably the Sierra Nevada is meant by this name; Hardouin\r\nconsiders it the same as the Sierra de los Vertientes.\r\n\r\n[818] Probably the Sierra Morena.\r\n\r\n[819] The Monte de Toledo.\r\n\r\n[820] The Sierra de las Asturias.\r\n\r\n[821] The present Cadiz. It was originally a Phœnician colony.\r\n\r\n[822] Now Cordova.\r\n\r\n[823] Now Ecija.\r\n\r\n[824] Now Seville.\r\n\r\n[825] The _Roman_ colonies or colonies “civium Romanorum” are those\r\nhere meant. The colonists in such case enjoyed all the rights of\r\nRoman citizens, the town in which they lived being founded under the\r\nsupervision of the Roman magistracy.\r\n\r\n[826] “Municipia.” These were towns in conquered countries which were\r\n_not_ founded by the Romans, but whose inhabitants retained their\r\noriginal institutions, at the same time receiving certain of the rights\r\nof Roman citizens; most frequently, immunity to a greater or less\r\ndegree from payment of tribute.\r\n\r\n[827] “Latium;” also called “Jus Latii” and “Latinitas.” This was the\r\nname given to those circumscribed or limited rights as Roman citizens\r\nwhich were at first bestowed upon the conquered states of Italy,\r\nbefore the time of the Social War. Indeed the _Latinus_ held a kind of\r\nintermediate state between the _Civis Romanus_ with all his rights, and\r\nthe _peregrinus_ or foreigner with all his disabilities. These Latin\r\nrights were afterwards extended to the people of other countries, but\r\nretained their original name.\r\n\r\n[828] The free towns were those, the inhabitants of which were at\r\nliberty to enjoy their ancient institutions and modes of internal\r\ngovernment, though at the same time they enjoyed none of the privileges\r\nof Roman citizens.\r\n\r\n[829] “Fœderati civitates;” the inhabitants of which were called\r\n‘fœderati’ or ‘socii.’ They were in alliance with the Romans, but in\r\nsome cases paid them tribute in the same manner as the ‘stipendiaria’\r\nnext mentioned. In some instances they also enjoyed the Latin rights.\r\n\r\n[830] From the numerous creeks or æstuaries with which the coast is\r\nhere indented. Commentators are at a loss for the site of the town of\r\nOnoba (or Ossonoba according to some readings). D’Anville considers it\r\nto be the same with the present town of Moguer; other commentators have\r\nsuggested Gibraleon, and the vicinity of Palos.\r\n\r\n[831] The Odiel and the Tinto; the Urium being supposed to be the same\r\nwith the Tinto of the present day.\r\n\r\n[832] Some readings have “Hareni montes,” and others “Arenæ montes,”\r\nthe “mountains of sand.” There is no doubt that the sandy heights or\r\ndowns on this coast are here meant, which are called at the present day\r\n“Dunes” by the French, and by the natives “Arenas gordas.”\r\n\r\n[833] Probably the line of sea-shore between Roia and the city of\r\nCadiz, skirting the Bay of Cadiz. Hardouin however thinks that the\r\ncoast between the Guadalquivir and the Guadalete is meant, now occupied\r\nin part by the town of San Lucar de Barameda.\r\n\r\n[834] In the Fourth Book, c. 36.\r\n\r\n[835] The present Cape Trafalgar.\r\n\r\n[836] Hardouin says that the present Vejer is the place meant, while\r\nothers have suggested Puerto de Santa Maria, or Cantillana. Others\r\nagain identify it with Bejer de la Frontera, though that place probably\r\nlies too far inland. The Roman ruins near Porto Barbato were probably\r\nits site.\r\n\r\n[837] Hardouin and other commentators suggest that the site of the\r\npresent Tarifa is here meant; it is more probable however that\r\nD’Anville is right in suggesting the now deserted town of Bolonia.\r\n\r\n[838] Probably the present Tarifa.\r\n\r\n[839] The exact site of Carteia is unknown; but it is generally\r\nsupposed to have stood upon the bay which opens out of the straits on\r\nthe west of the Rock of Gibraltar, now called the Bay of Algesiras or\r\nGibraltar; and upon the hill at the head of the bay of El Rocadillo,\r\nabout half-way between Algesiras and Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[840] We learn also from Strabo, that Tartessus was the same place as\r\nCarteia; it is not improbable that the former was pretty nearly the\r\nPhœnician name of the place, and the latter a Roman corruption of it,\r\nand that in it originated the ‘Tarshish’ of Scripture, an appellation\r\napparently given to the whole of the southern part of the Spanish\r\npeninsula. Probably the Greeks preserved the appellation of the place\r\nmore in conformity with the original Phœnician name.\r\n\r\n[841] By the “inland sea” Pliny means the Mediterranean, in\r\ncontradistinction to the Atlantic Ocean without the Straits of Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[842] The ruins of this place, probably, are still to be seen on the\r\neast bank of the river Guadiaro, here alluded to.\r\n\r\n[843] With its river flowing by it. This place is probably the present\r\nMarbella, situate on the Rio Verde.\r\n\r\n[844] Probably the present Castillo de Torremolinos, or else Castillo\r\nde Fuengirola.\r\n\r\n[845] The present city of Malaga. Hardouin thinks that the river\r\nGuadalquivirejo is here meant, but as that is some miles distant from\r\nthe city, it is more probable that Guadalmedina, which is much nearer\r\nto it, is the stream alluded to.\r\n\r\n[846] Not improbably Velez Malaga, upon a river of the same name.\r\nHardouin thinks that the place is the modern Torrox on the Fiu Frio,\r\nand D’Anville the present city of Almunecar, on the Rio Verde.\r\n\r\n[847] Most probably the present Almunecar, but it is uncertain.\r\nD’Anville says the present Torre de Banas; others have suggested the\r\ntown of Motril.\r\n\r\n[848] Now Salobrena.\r\n\r\n[849] Either the present Adra or Abdera: it is uncertain which.\r\n\r\n[850] Probably the present Mujacar. D’Anville suggests Almeria.\r\n\r\n[851] Also called Bastitani, a mixed race, partly Iberian and partly\r\nPhœnician.\r\n\r\n[852] The Greek Λύσσα, “frantic rage” or “madness.” The etymologies\r\nhere suggested are puerile in the extreme.\r\n\r\n[853] Plutarch, quoting from the Twelfth Book of the Iberica of\r\nSosthenes, tells us that, “After Bacchus had conquered Iberia [the\r\npresent Spain], he left Pan to act as his deputy, and he changed its\r\nname and called the country _Pania_, after himself, which afterwards\r\nbecame corrupted into _Spania_.”\r\n\r\n[854] He alludes to the expedition of Hercules into Spain, of which\r\nDiodorus Siculus makes mention; also his courtship of the nymph\r\nPyrene, the daughter of Bebryx, who was buried by him on the Pyrenæan\r\nmountains, which thence derived their name.\r\n\r\n[855] It is unknown where this town was situate; Hardouin and D’Anville\r\nthink it was on the site of the present village of San Thome, once an\r\nepiscopal see, now removed to Jaen. The people of Mentisa, mentioned in\r\nc. 4, were probably inhabitants of a different place. D’Anville in his\r\nmap has two Mentisas, one ‘Oretana,’ the other ‘Bastitana.’\r\n\r\n[856] According to D’Anville, the place now called Toia.\r\n\r\n[857] Now the Segura.\r\n\r\n[858] ‘Nova’ or ‘New’ Carthage, so called from having been originally\r\nfounded by a colony of Carthaginians B.C. 242. It was situate a little\r\nto the west of the Saturni Promontorium, or Promontory of Palos. It was\r\ntaken by Scipio Africanus the elder B.C. 210.\r\n\r\n[859] The present Lorca.\r\n\r\n[860] This place is even now called by the inhabitants Sepulcro de\r\nScipion. Cneius Cornelius Scipio Calvus, after the defeat of his\r\nbrother P. Cornelius Scipio, in the year B.C. 211, by the forces of\r\nAsdrubal and Mago, fled to a tower at this spot, which was set fire to\r\nby the troops of Asdrubal, and he perished in the flames.\r\n\r\n[861] So called from the town of Ossigi afterwards mentioned.\r\n\r\n[862] It is unknown where this place stood; Medina Sidonia has been\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n[863] Probably the present Fuentes del Rey, between Andujar and Jaen,\r\naccording to Pinet.\r\n\r\n[864] D’Anville suggests that this is the present Arjona; but more\r\nprobably it was the village of Arjonilla, two leagues south of Andujar.\r\nGruter has an inscription found here, “MUNIC. ALBENSE URGANON.”\r\n\r\n[865] There were five cities of this name in Spain. Hardouin thinks\r\nthat this is the modern Alcala la Real, between Granada and Cordova.\r\n\r\n[866] Most probably the modern Sierra de Elvira, though some writers\r\nhave suggested the city of Granada.\r\n\r\n[867] Probably near the modern Montilla. Hardouin takes it to be the\r\npresent Granada.\r\n\r\n[868] Poinsinet thinks that this is the present Ecija, but other\r\nwriters take it to be Alhama, between Granada and Malaga.\r\n\r\n[869] Perhaps the present Archidona. Some writers have suggested the\r\nmodern Faventia and Velez.\r\n\r\n[870] Probably near the present Puente de Don Gonzalo, on the banks of\r\nthe Rio Genil.\r\n\r\n[871] Probably near Aguilar on the river Cabra; or else the present\r\nTeba, between Osuna and Antequera.\r\n\r\n[872] Agla the Less.\r\n\r\n[873] Probably the present Cabra. The sites of the two preceding towns\r\nare not known.\r\n\r\n[874] “The Encampment in the Vineyards.” Probably this was the same as\r\nthe Castra Postumiana mentioned by Hirtius in his Book on the Spanish\r\nWar as being four miles from Attegua. It appears to be the present\r\nCastro, or Castro el Rio, situate on the banks of the river Guadajoz.\r\n\r\n[875] In some readings “Episibrium.” Probably the present Espeja.\r\n\r\n[876] Its present site is unknown.\r\n\r\n[877] According to D’Anville, the present Puente de Pinos, six leagues\r\nnorth of Granada. Others take it to be Illora, south of Alcala la Real.\r\n\r\n[878] The present Huesca, according to Hardouin; more probably,\r\nhowever, Huector, on the banks of the river Genil.\r\n\r\n[879] Perhaps Escusar, five leagues from Granada. But according to some\r\nit is the same as Truelo or Eruelo.\r\n\r\n[880] Called Ucubis by Hirtius. Morales suggests that it is Sierra la\r\nRonda, but Pinet says Stoponda.\r\n\r\n[881] The sites of this and the preceding place are unknown.\r\n\r\n[882] In relation to the ‘conventus juridicus,’ we may here observe\r\nthat under the Roman sway, in order to facilitate the administration of\r\njustice, a province was divided into a number of districts or circuits,\r\neach of which was so called, as also ‘forum’ or ‘jurisdictio’. At\r\ncertain times of the year fixed by the proconsul or chief magistrate,\r\nthe people assembled in the chief town of the district (whence the name\r\n‘conventus’), upon which judges were selected to try the causes of\r\nlitigant parties.\r\n\r\n[883] Probably near the town at the present day called Espelui. Strabo,\r\nin Book iii., tells us that Laconian institutions and customs were\r\nprevalent in some parts of Spain.\r\n\r\n[884] This place was ravaged by fire and levelled with the ground by\r\nthe troops of Scipio, in consequence of the vigorous defence they had\r\nmade, and the losses they had caused to the Roman army. It probably\r\nstood about four miles from the present city of Baeza.\r\n\r\n[885] The sites of this place and the next are unknown.\r\n\r\n[886] Most probably the present town of Porcuna. Ubeda or Ubedos has\r\nalso been suggested.\r\n\r\n[887] The present town of Montoro.\r\n\r\n[888] Now Alcoorrucen, near Perabad.\r\n\r\n[889] Ansart suggests that the reading is not Sacili of the Martiales,\r\nbut Onoba of the Martiales, to distinguish it from Onoba Æstuaria,\r\npreviously mentioned. It is not improbable that the place was so called\r\nfrom the Martian or Martial legion having originally colonized it. The\r\nsite of Onoba is unknown.\r\n\r\n[890] Cordova was so called from the great number of patricians, who\r\nwere among the original colonists, when it was founded by Marcellus.\r\nTo the present day it is noted for the pride of its nobles. The Great\r\nCaptain Gonzalo de Cordova used to say, that “other towns might be\r\nbetter to live in, but there was none better to be born in.” It was the\r\nbirth-place of Lucan and the two Senecas.\r\n\r\n[891] The site of these two places is unknown at the present day.\r\n\r\n[892] Now called by the similar name of Genil or Xenil.\r\n\r\n[893] Perhaps the present Alcolea.\r\n\r\n[894] Perhaps the Cantillana of the present day: there is, however, the\r\ngreatest uncertainty as to the sites of these places.\r\n\r\n[895] According to Hardouin, the modern city of Penaflor: D’Anville\r\nplaces it about two leagues thence, and near the city of Lora.\r\n\r\n[896] Now Sevilla la Vieja, or Old Seville; called by the lower classes\r\nSanti-pone.\r\n\r\n[897] Now Seville. This colony was founded by Julius Cæsar, and also\r\nbore the name of Julia Romula.\r\n\r\n[898] Or north side of the river.\r\n\r\n[899] Probably on the site of the present Alcala del Rio.\r\n\r\n[900] ‘The [good] genius of Julius,’ probably meaning Cæsar. Nothing\r\nseems to be known of its site.\r\n\r\n[901] Caura may be the present Coria, a town three leagues from Seville.\r\n\r\n[902] Probably the Rio Guadalete.\r\n\r\n[903] Either the present Sebrija, or in the vicinity of the city of San\r\nLucar.\r\n\r\n[904] Probably the present Bonania.\r\n\r\n[905] Probably between Trebujena and the city of Xeres. It was the\r\nusual place of meeting for the people of the territory of Gades; and\r\nits importance may be judged from its appellation ‘Regia’ or ‘royal,’\r\nand its numerous coins. Its ruins are still to be seen on a hill there.\r\n\r\n[906] It is not improbable that this was the present city of Xeres.\r\nSome geographers however take it to be that of Medina Sidonia, and look\r\nupon Xeres as the site of the ancient Asta.\r\n\r\n[907] Now Ecija. It stood on the plain of the Bætis, some distance\r\nsouth of the river, on its tributary the Singulis or Xenil.\r\n\r\n[908] The site of this place is unknown. It probably obtained its name\r\nfrom being a colony of one of the legions, the 7th, 10th, 13th or 14th;\r\nwhich were called ‘geminæ’ or ‘gemellæ,’ from being composed of the men\r\nof two legions originally.\r\n\r\n[909] “The Valour of Julius.” Sanson places it not far from Miragenil.\r\n\r\n[910] “The Fame of Julius.” Perhaps the present Olivera, or else Teba,\r\nsix leagues to the south of Estepa.\r\n\r\n[911] The present city of Ossuna. “Genua Urbanorum” would seem to\r\nmean “the knees of the citizens.” Though all the MSS. agree in this\r\nreading, it probably is an error for “gemina Urbanorum,” and it may\r\nhave been a colony of one of the legions called ‘geminæ’ or ‘gemellæ,’\r\nas previously mentioned. The other part of its appellation may possibly\r\nhave originated in the fact of its first inhabitants being all natives\r\nof the city of Rome.\r\n\r\n[912] The use of the word _fuit_, ‘was,’ implies that the place had\r\nbeen destroyed. Cneius Pompeius, the eldest son of Pompey the Great,\r\nwas defeated at Munda, in the year B.C. 45, and the town destroyed.\r\nPompey escaped from the battle, but was taken a short time after and\r\nput to death. The site of the ancient town is very generally supposed\r\nto be the modern village of Monda, S.W. of Malaga, and about three\r\nleagues from the sea. It is more probable however that it was in the\r\nvicinity of Cordova, and there are ruins of ancient walls and towers\r\nbetween Martos, Alcandete, Espejo and Baena, which are supposed to\r\ndenote its site.\r\n\r\n[913] Now Alameda; eight leagues from the other Astiji or Ecija.\r\n\r\n[914] Now Estepa, six leagues from Ecija.\r\n\r\n[915] Perhaps Mancloua, between the towns of Ecija and Carmona; the\r\nsites of all the other places here mentioned appear to be quite unknown.\r\n\r\n[916] Sanson supposes the Alostigi to have inhabited the territory near\r\nAlmagia, between Malaga and Antiqueira.\r\n\r\n[917] The Celtici are supposed to have inhabited the country between\r\nthe Guadiana and Guadalquivir, the eastern parts of Alentejo and the\r\nwest of Estremadura, as far as the city of Badajoz.\r\n\r\n[918] Probably part of Estremadura, and the vicinity of Badajoz in an\r\neasterly direction.\r\n\r\n[919] The exact meaning of this passage is somewhat obscure, but he\r\nprobably means to say that the Celtici have an identity of sacred\r\nrites, language, and names of towns with the Celtiberians; though it\r\nhad become the usage in Bætica more generally to distinguish the towns\r\nby their Roman names.\r\n\r\n[920] “The Fame of Julius.” Its site is not known.\r\n\r\n[921] “The Concord of Julius.” Probably the same as the modern Valera\r\nla Vega, near Frejenal.\r\n\r\n[922] Probably meaning “Restored by Julius.” Nothing is known of its\r\nsite.\r\n\r\n[923] According to an authority quoted by Hardouin, this may possibly\r\nbe Medina de las Torres.\r\n\r\n[924] Probably Constantina in Andalusia, to the north of Penaflor.\r\n\r\n[925] The tribe or nation of the Tereses are supposed to have dwelt in\r\nthe vicinity of the modern San Nicolo del Puerto.\r\n\r\n[926] Calentum was their town; probably the present Cazalla near\r\nAlaniz. This place will be found mentioned by Pliny in B. xxxv. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[927] The ruins two leagues north of Ronda la Vieja are supposed to be\r\nthose of this place. There are the remains of an aqueduct and theatre,\r\nand numerous coins are found here.\r\n\r\n[928] Probably the present Ronda la Vieja.\r\n\r\n[929] Identified by inscriptions with the present Aroche. The sites of\r\nseveral of the following places are unknown.\r\n\r\n[930] The Azuaga of modern times; but, according to Hardouin, Argallen.\r\n\r\n[931] According to Hardouin this was on the site of the modern Fuente\r\nde la Ovejuna, fourteen leagues from Cordova.\r\n\r\n[932] This has been identified by inscriptions with the modern Villa de\r\nCapilla.\r\n\r\n[933] According to Hardouin, the modern Almaden de la Plata.\r\n\r\n[934] Probably the same as the modern Monte Major.\r\n\r\n[935] The ruins of this place are probably those seen at Carixa, near\r\nBornos, in the vicinity of Seville.\r\n\r\n[936] According to Hardouin, the same as the modern Las Cabezas, not\r\nfar from Lebrija.\r\n\r\n[937] The sites of these two towns are unknown. Bæsippo, Barbesula and\r\nCallet have been already mentioned.\r\n\r\n[938] The ruins of Saguntia are to be seen between Arcos and Xeres\r\ndella Frontera, on the river Guadalete; they bear their ancient name\r\nunder the form of Cigonza. Mela, B. iii. c. 1, says that Oleastro was a\r\ngrove near the Bay of Cadiz. Brana was probably the same place that is\r\nmentioned by Ptolemy under the name of Urbona.\r\n\r\n[939] We may here mention for the more correct information of the\r\nreader that the Roman mile consisted of 1000 paces, each pace being\r\nfive English feet. Hence its length was 1618 English yards (taking\r\nthe Roman foot at 11·6496 English inches), or 142 yards less than the\r\nEnglish statute mile.\r\n\r\n[940] Nova Carthago, or New Carthage.\r\n\r\n[941] Now Cazlona, on the confines of New Castile and the kingdom of\r\nGranada. It was a place of great importance, and the chief town of the\r\nOretani. Himilce, the rich wife of Hannibal, was a native of this place.\r\n\r\n[942] This was the ‘porticus Octaviæ,’ which, having been commenced by\r\nhis sister Octavia, the wife of Marcellus and Antony, was completed\r\nby Augustus. It lay between the Circus Flaminius and the Theatre of\r\nMarcellus, occupying the site of the former portico, which had been\r\nbuilt by Q. Cæcilius Metellus, and enclosing the two temples of Juno\r\nand of Jupiter Stator. It contained a public library, in which the\r\nSenate often met, and it was in this probably that the map or plan,\r\nmentioned by Pliny, was deposited. It also contained a great number of\r\nstatues, paintings, and other works of art, which, with the library,\r\nwere destroyed by fire in the reign of Titus.\r\n\r\n[943] Nova Carthago or New Carthage, now Carthagena.\r\n\r\n[944] Now Zaragoza or Saragossa, on the right bank of the river\r\nEbro. Its original name was Salduba, but it was changed in honour of\r\nAugustus, who colonized it after the Cantabrian war, B.C. 25.\r\n\r\n[945] This was the most remote place of any consideration in\r\nCeltiberia, on the west. Its ruins are still to be seen on the summit\r\nof a hill surrounded with rocks, forming a natural wall between Corunna\r\ndel Conde and Pennalda de Castro.\r\n\r\n[946] This was Asturica Augusta, the chief city of the nation of the\r\nAstures, and situate on one of the tributaries of the Astura, now\r\nEsta. On its site is situate the present Astorga: its ruins are very\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\n[947] Now Lugo.\r\n\r\n[948] Or Bracara Augusta, now Braga. Among the ruins of the ancient\r\ncity there are the remains of an aqueduct and amphitheatre.\r\n\r\n[949] Probably the present town of Vera near Muxacra.\r\n\r\n[950] The “Promontory of Saturn,” now Cabo de Palos.\r\n\r\n[951] D’Anville takes this place to be the port of Vacur; if so, the\r\ndistance from Cape Palos is exactly 170 miles.\r\n\r\n[952] Now Segura.\r\n\r\n[953] The modern town of Elche was probably built from the ruins of\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\n[954] Now called the Gulf of Alicant.\r\n\r\n[955] With the Arabian _El_ prefixed, this has formed the name of the\r\nfamous port of Alicant.\r\n\r\n[956] Now Denia, a thriving town.\r\n\r\n[957] Now called the Xucar.\r\n\r\n[958] Now called Albufera.\r\n\r\n[959] The present city of Valencia.\r\n\r\n[960] Or Turia, now the Guadalaviar.\r\n\r\n[961] Or Saguntus, famed for the fidelity of its inhabitants to the\r\nRoman cause: after a siege of nine months, rather than submit to the\r\nCarthaginians under Hannibal, they set fire to their town and perished\r\nin the flames, B.C. 219. It was rebuilt eight years afterwards and\r\nmade a Roman colony. The ruins of the ancient town, which was said to\r\nhave been originally founded by Greeks from Zacynthus, are still to be\r\nseen, and the ancient walls (_muri veteres_) give name to the present\r\nMurviedro, which is built on its site.\r\n\r\n[962] Now the Murviedro, which flows past the city of that name and the\r\ntown of Segorbe.\r\n\r\n[963] Dertosa, the present Tortosa, is supposed to have been inhabited\r\nby them.\r\n\r\n[964] Now the Ebro.\r\n\r\n[965] Hardouin places this on the site of the modern Fuente de Ivero.\r\nThe Ebro takes its rise in the Val de Vieso.\r\n\r\n[966] According to D’Anville, the present Logrono. At present the\r\nEbro only becomes navigable at Tudela, 216 miles from the sea. Other\r\nwriters, however, take Varia to be the present Valtierra, near Tudela.\r\n\r\n[967] Or the Subur, now the Francoli. It flows into the sea at the port\r\nof Tarraco, now Tarragona.\r\n\r\n[968] The more ancient commentators think that Carthago Vetus, or the\r\ncolony of Old Carthage (now Carta la Vieja), is here alluded to, but\r\nmore probably it is Carthago Nova that is meant.\r\n\r\n[969] On the Subi, previously mentioned; now called Villa Nova.\r\n\r\n[970] Now the Llobregat.\r\n\r\n[971] Their territory was situate around the present Gulf of Ampurias.\r\n\r\n[972] Their chief cities were Gerunda, the present Gerona, and Ausa or\r\nVicus Ausæ, now Vic d’Osona.\r\n\r\n[973] In the country beyond Gerona.\r\n\r\n[974] Living in the upper valley of the river Sicoris or Segre, which\r\nstill retains, from them, the name of Cerdague.\r\n\r\n[975] The people of the modern Navarre and Guipuzcoa.\r\n\r\n[976] In the later writers Barcelo, now Barcelona. It was said to have\r\nbeen originally founded by Hercules, and afterwards rebuilt by Hamilcar\r\nBarcas, who gave it the name of his family. Its name as a Roman colony\r\nwas Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino. The modern city stands\r\nsomewhat to the east of the ancient one.\r\n\r\n[977] The modern Badalona, two leagues from Barcelona.\r\n\r\n[978] On the sea-shore,—the present Pineda.\r\n\r\n[979] Now the Tordera.\r\n\r\n[980] The modern city of Blanos stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[981] Probably the present Ter or Tet.\r\n\r\n[982] The modern Ampurias. We learn from Strabo that a wall divided the\r\ntown of the Greeks from that of the old inhabitants. It was the usual\r\nlanding-place for travellers from Gaul. It was originally colonized by\r\nthe Phocæans from Massilia or Marseilles.\r\n\r\n[983] Hardouin says that the Ticher or Tichis is the same with the\r\nmodern Ter, but in such case Pliny would have mentioned it before\r\ncoming to Emporiæ. Its present name however does not appear to be\r\naccurately known.\r\n\r\n[984] A promontory extending from the Pyrenæan chain, on which a temple\r\nof Venus was situate. It is now called Cabo de Cruz. The distance\r\nmentioned by Pliny is probably too great.\r\n\r\n[985] The people of the present Tortosa.\r\n\r\n[986] Probably not the same people as the Edetani, in whose district\r\nSaguntum and Valencia were situate.\r\n\r\n[987] The people of Gerunda or Gerona.\r\n\r\n[988] They are nowhere else mentioned. Ukert supposes that their city\r\nstood in the district between the Sicoris and Nucaria.\r\n\r\n[989] Their city was Tiara Julia.\r\n\r\n[990] The people of Aquæ Calidæ or the ‘Hot Springs,’ called at the\r\npresent day Caldes, four leagues from the city of Barcelona.\r\n\r\n[991] Ptolemy places Bæcula between Ausa and Gerunda.\r\n\r\n[992] The people of the present Belchite.\r\n\r\n[993] The people of the present Xelsa, on the Ebro.\r\n\r\n[994] The inhabitants of Calagurris, now Calahorra, a city of the\r\nVascones, on the banks of the Ebro. They remained faithful to Sertorius\r\nto the last, and after slaughtering their wives and children and eating\r\ntheir flesh, their city was taken and destroyed; which event put an end\r\nto the Sertorian war. It was called “Nassica,” in contradistinction\r\nto Calagurris Fibularia, which is afterwards mentioned by Pliny. The\r\nlatter is mentioned by Cæsar as forming one community with Osca (now\r\nHuesca), and was probably the present Loarre, though some writers take\r\nthe first-named Calagurris to be that place, and the latter one to be\r\nthe present Calahorra.\r\n\r\n[995] The people of Ilerda, the present Lerida, on the Sicoris or\r\nSegre. It is memorable for its siege by Cæsar, when the Pompeian\r\nforces under Afranius and Petreius had retired thither. It was a most\r\nflourishing city, though in the times of the later Roman emperors it\r\nhad fallen into decay.\r\n\r\n[996] The people of the present Huesca.\r\n\r\n[997] The inhabitants of Turiazo, the present Tarazona, five leagues\r\nsouth of Tudela.\r\n\r\n[998] The people of Cascantum, the present town of Cascante in Navarre.\r\n\r\n[999] The people of Ergavica. Its ruins, at the confluence of the\r\nGuadiela and Tagus, are still to be seen, and are called Santaver. By\r\nsome writers this place is considered to be the same as the modern\r\nFraga, on the river Cinca, five leagues from Lerida.\r\n\r\n[1000] The people of Graccuris. Its former name of Ilurcis was changed\r\nin honour of Sempronius Gracchus, who placed new settlers there after\r\nthe conquest of Celtiberia. It is supposed to be the same as the modern\r\nAgreda, four leagues from Tarazona.\r\n\r\n[1001] The people of Leonica, probably the modern Alcaniz, on the river\r\nGuadalope, in Arragon.\r\n\r\n[1002] The people of Tarraga, the present Tarrega, nine leagues east of\r\nLerida, in Catalonia.\r\n\r\n[1003] The people of Arcobriga, now Los Arcos, in Navarre, five leagues\r\nsouth of Estella.\r\n\r\n[1004] Perhaps the same as the Andosini, a people mentioned by\r\nPolybius, B. iii. c. 35, as situate between the Iberus and the\r\nPyrenees. There is a small town of Navarre called Androilla.\r\n\r\n[1005] The people probably of the site now occupied by Huarte Araquil,\r\nsix leagues to the west of Pampeluna.\r\n\r\n[1006] Probably the same as the Bursaones of Livy, the Bursavolenses\r\nof Hirtius, and the Bursadenses of Ptolemy. Their exact locality is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n[1007] Mention has been made of Calagurris Fibularensis or Fibulicensis\r\nunder Calagurris Nassica: see p. 168.\r\n\r\n[1008] The people of Complutum, the modern Alcala de Henares, on the\r\nriver Henares, six leagues to the east of Madrid. It is not quite\r\ncertain whether it stood on the exact site of Alcala, or on the hill of\r\nZulema, on the other side of the Henares.\r\n\r\n[1009] The town of Cares, adjoining the more modern one of Puente la\r\nReyna, probably marks their site.\r\n\r\n[1010] Probably so called from the river Cinga, the modern Cinca: or\r\nthey may have given their name thereto.\r\n\r\n[1011] The people probably of the present Mediana on the Ebro, six\r\nleagues below Zaragoza.\r\n\r\n[1012] Their town was Larnum, situate on a river of the same name. It\r\nwas probably the present Torderas, situate on the river of that name.\r\n\r\n[1013] Of this people nothing appears to be known. In the old editions\r\nthe next people mentioned are the “Ispalenses,” but since the time of\r\nHardouin, they have been generally omitted, as wrongly introduced,\r\nand as utterly unknown. Spanish coins have however been more recently\r\ndiscovered with the name ‘Sblaie’ or ‘Splaie,’ inscribed in Celtiberian\r\ncharacters, and numismatists are of opinion that they indicate the name\r\nof the town of this people, which in Latin would be Ispala. This at all\r\nevents is the opinion of M. de Sauley.\r\n\r\n[1014] The people of the present town of Lumbier in Navarre, called by\r\nits inhabitants Irumberri.\r\n\r\n[1015] The people of the present city of Pampeluna.\r\n\r\n[1016] Carthago Nova, or New Carthage.\r\n\r\n[1017] The colony of Acci was called Colonia Julia Gemella Accitana.\r\nThe town of Acci or Accis was on the site of the present Guadix el\r\nViejo, between Granada and Baza. It was colonized by the third and\r\nsixth legions under Julius or Augustus, from which it obtained the name\r\nof ‘Gemella,’ the origin of which name is previously mentioned, p. 161.\r\n\r\n[1018] The ruins of this place are supposed to be those seen at\r\nLebazuza or Lezuza, not far from the city of Cuença.\r\n\r\n[1019] The “jus Italicum” or “Italiæ,” “Italian rights” or\r\n“privileges,” differed from the “jus Latinum.” It was granted to\r\nprovincial towns which were especially favoured by the magistracy of\r\nRome, and consisted of exemption from taxes, a municipal constitution,\r\nafter the manner of the Italian towns, and many other rights and\r\nexemptions.\r\n\r\n[1020] According to Hardouin, the people of the town formerly called\r\nSaliotis, now Cazorla. They are called “Cæsari venales,” from the\r\ncircumstance of their territory having been purchased by Cæsar.—Castulo\r\nor Cazlona has been previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1021] The people of Sætabis, now Xativa in Valencia. This town was\r\nfamous for its manufacture of fine table-napkins, to which reference\r\nis made by Pliny at the beginning of his Introduction addressed to\r\nTitus, in his quotation from the lament of Catullus on the loss of his\r\ntable-napkins which his friends had filched from him. See p. 1 of the\r\npresent volume.\r\n\r\n[1022] According to some writers, the present Cuença was the ancient\r\nValeria; but perhaps it was situate at the present village of Valera la\r\nVieja, or Old Valeria, eight leagues south of Cuença.\r\n\r\n[1023] The people of Alaba, not far from the present town of Ergavica.\r\n\r\n[1024] They were so called from their town of Basti, now Baza, on the\r\nriver Guadalentin in Granada.\r\n\r\n[1025] Their town was probably the present Consuegra, twelve leagues\r\nfrom the city of Toledo.\r\n\r\n[1026] So called from the promontory Dianium or Artemisium, named from\r\na temple of Diana there situate, and having in its vicinity a town\r\nof the same name. The present town of Denia still retains nearly the\r\noriginal name. Its lake, now called Albufera de Valencia, has been\r\npreviously mentioned, p. 166.\r\n\r\n[1027] The modern Yniesta marks the site of their town.\r\n\r\n[1028] The people probably of Eliocroca, now Lorca, on the high road,\r\nfrom Carthago Nova to Castulo.\r\n\r\n[1029] There were two places of the name of Mentesa, one in the\r\ndistrict of the Oritani, and the other in that of the Bastitani or\r\nBastuli.\r\n\r\n[1030] Ptolemy, B. ii., mentions a city of this nation, called ‘Oretum\r\nGermanorum.’ It has been supposed that it was the present Calatrava,\r\nfive leagues from Ciudad Real.\r\n\r\n[1031] Supposed to be in the vicinity of the present Calatajud.\r\n\r\n[1032] The present Toledo.\r\n\r\n[1033] Their town is supposed to have stood on the site of the present\r\nMurcia.\r\n\r\n[1034] Now Coruña del Conde.\r\n\r\n[1035] The people of the present Alava on the Ebro.—A small town there\r\nstill bears the name of Alvana.\r\n\r\n[1036] This nation is not mentioned elsewhere. Possibly they are the\r\nMurbogi, mentioned by Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[1037] Their town Segisamon was either the present Veyzama in\r\nGuipuzcoa, or, more probably, Sasamon, eight leagues north-west of\r\nBurgos.\r\n\r\n[1038] The people of Carissa, on the site of the present Carixa near\r\nSeville.\r\n\r\n[1039] Strabo assigns the Numantini to the Arevacæ, and not the\r\nPelendones. The ruins of the city of Numantia were still to be seen\r\nat Puente Garray near the city of Soria, in Hardouin’s time, the 17th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[1040] D’Anville places their city, Intercatia, at the place called\r\nVilla nueva de Azuague, forty miles from the present Astorga; others\r\nagain make it to have been sixty miles from that place.\r\n\r\n[1041] Their town was on the site of the modern city of Palencia, on\r\nthe river Carion.\r\n\r\n[1042] The people of Cauca, the present Coca, situate between Segovia\r\nand Valladolid, on the river Eresma.\r\n\r\n[1043] This was the chief city of the Cantabri. It has been already\r\nmentioned, but we may add that it stood near the sources of the Ebro,\r\non the eminence of Retortillo, south of Reynosa. Five stones still mark\r\nthe boundaries which divided the territory from that of the Fourth\r\nLegio.\r\n\r\n[1044] Supposed to be the present Briviesca; the site of Tritium does\r\nnot appear to be known, but it has been suggested that it was near\r\nNajara, in the vicinity of Logrono.\r\n\r\n[1045] It does not appear to be certain whether the Areva was the\r\npresent Ucero, or the Arlanzon, which flows near Valladolid.\r\n\r\n[1046] The modern Siguenza.\r\n\r\n[1047] Now El Burgo d’Osma, in the province of Soria.\r\n\r\n[1048] This must not be mistaken for the modern Segovia, between Madrid\r\nand Valladolid: it was a small town in the vicinity of Numantia.\r\n\r\n[1049] Probably the present Lerma, on the river Arlanza.\r\n\r\n[1050] The people of Asturica Augusta, now Astorga, in the province of\r\nLeon. The ruins of this fine city are said still to give a perfect idea\r\nof a fortified Roman town.\r\n\r\n[1051] Their chief city stood on the site of the present Cigarrosa,\r\nor San Estevan de Val de Orres. Its ruins are still to be seen, and a\r\nRoman bridge, the people preserving a tradition that an old town once\r\nstood there called Guigurra.\r\n\r\n[1052] The people of Lance or Lancia, probably the present Lollanco or\r\nMansilla; though Oviedo has been suggested. This however may be the\r\nOvetum mentioned by Pliny in B. xxxiv. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[1053] Mentioned by Pliny in B. xix. c. 2, as famous for their flax.\r\nTheir locality near the coast does not appear to be exactly known. The\r\nPæsici previously mentioned were situate on the peninsula of Cabo de\r\nPenas.\r\n\r\n[1054] Now the city of Lugo in Gallicia.\r\n\r\n[1055] The people of Bracara Augusta, now Braga. Among the ruins of\r\nthe ancient city are the remains of an aqueduct and an amphitheatre.\r\nThis people probably derived their name from their fashion of wearing\r\nbraccæ, “breeches” or “trowsers,” like their neighbours of Gallia\r\nBraccata. The exact localities of the various other tribes here\r\nmentioned do not appear to be exactly known.\r\n\r\n[1056] Our author is mistaken here, even making allowance for the\r\nshortness of the Roman mile (1618 yards), as the length is only 470\r\nmiles. Coastwise it is 620.\r\n\r\n[1057] Now Oyarzun. It is also mentioned in B. iv. c. 34.\r\n\r\n[1058] He is also in error here; for, taken in a straight line, this\r\ndistance is but 210 miles.\r\n\r\n[1059] The distance is about 560 miles.\r\n\r\n[1060] It may be worth while here to take some notice of the mineral\r\nproductions of Spain in modern times, from which we shall be able to\r\nform a more accurate judgement as to the correctness of the statement\r\nhere made by Pliny. Grains of gold are still to be found in the rivers\r\nTagus and Douro; but there is not found sufficient of the precious\r\nmetal to pay for the search. Silver is found in the mines of the Guadal\r\ncanal. Copper and lead are to be found in abundance. There is a mine\r\nof plumbago four leagues from Ronda; and tin is found in Gallicia. In\r\nevery province there are iron mines, those in Biscay being the most\r\nremarkable. Lodestone is found in Seville, cobalt on the Pyrenees,\r\nquicksilver and cinnabar at Almaden, arsenic in Asturias, and coal in\r\nAsturias and Arragon. There are salt-mines at Mingrilla and Cardona;\r\nalum is found in Arragon, antimony at Alcaraz. On the Sierra Morena,\r\nand in Gallicia, there is saltpetre in numerous localities; amber in\r\nAsturias and Valencia, and sulphur in Murcia, Arragon, and Seville.\r\nPipe-clay of a peculiar quality is found in the vicinity of Andujar.\r\nGypsum and marble are found in great abundance, and stone for budding\r\npurposes, of the best quality. Amethysts, white cornelians, rubies,\r\nagates, garnets, and rock crystals, with other precious stones, are\r\nalso found in abundance and of the finest quality.\r\n\r\n[1061] Transparent stone. Further mention is made of it by Pliny in B.\r\nxxxv. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[1062] Or Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[1063] From the chief city Narbo Martius, and later Narbona, now\r\nNarbonne, situate on the river Atax, now Aude. It was made a Roman\r\ncolony by the Consul Q. Martius B.C. 118, and from him received its\r\nsurname. It was the residence of the Roman governor of the province and\r\na place of great commercial importance. There are scarcely any remains\r\nof the ancient city, but some vestiges of the canal, by which it was\r\nconnected with the sea at twelve miles’ distance.\r\n\r\n[1064] From the linen breeches which the inhabitants wore, a fashion\r\nwhich was not adopted by the Romans till the time of the Emperors.\r\nSeverus wore them, but the use of them was restricted by Honorius.\r\n\r\n[1065] Still called the ‘Var.’ It divides France from Nice, a province\r\nof Sardinia.\r\n\r\n[1066] Now the Cevennes. They lie as much to the west as the north of\r\nGallia Narbonensis.\r\n\r\n[1067] The range of the Jura, north of the Lake of Geneva.\r\n\r\n[1068] Inhabiting the former Comté de Roussillon, or Département des\r\nPyrénées Orientales. They were said to have been originally a Bebrycian\r\nor Thracian colony.\r\n\r\n[1069] Probably the inhabitants of the present Conserans, on the west\r\nof the Département de l’Arriége.\r\n\r\n[1070] Probably the Tech, and the Verdouble, which falls into the Gly.\r\n\r\n[1071] Probably the present Elne, on the Tech.\r\n\r\n[1072] The present Castel Roussillon.\r\n\r\n[1073] The Aude of the present day.\r\n\r\n[1074] The bodies of water now called Etangs de Bages et de Sigean.\r\n\r\n[1075] Now the Herault.\r\n\r\n[1076] Now called the Lez, near the city of Montpellier.\r\n\r\n[1077] Now called Etangs de Leucate, de Sigean, de Gruissan, de\r\nVendres, de Thau, de Maguelonne, de Perols, de Mauguio, du Repausset;\r\nMarais d’Escamandre, de Lermitane et de la Souteyrane, and numerous\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[1078] Now the town of Agde. Strabo also informs us that this place was\r\nfounded by the Massilians.\r\n\r\n[1079] This people seems to have inhabited the eastern parts of the\r\ndepartments of l’Arriége and the Haute Garonne, that of Aude, the south\r\nof that of Tarn, and of that of Herault, except the arrondissement of\r\nMontpellier.\r\n\r\n[1080] Dalechamp takes this to be Foz les Martigues; but the locality\r\nis doubtful. Most probably this is the same place that is mentioned by\r\nStrabo as Rhoë, in conjunction with the town of Agathe or Agde, and the\r\nRodanusia of Stephen of Byzantium, who places it in the district of\r\nMassilia or Marseilles.\r\n\r\n[1081] Now the Rhone.\r\n\r\n[1082] Now the Lake of Geneva.\r\n\r\n[1083] The modern Saone.\r\n\r\n[1084] Now the rivers Isère and Durance.\r\n\r\n[1085] Most probably from Libici, a town in the south of Gaul, of which\r\nthere are coins in existence, but nothing else seems to be known. At\r\nthe present day there are four mouths of the Rhone, the most westerly\r\nof which is called the “Dead” Rhone; the next the “Lesser” Rhone; the\r\nthird the “Old” Rhone; and the fourth simply the Rhone. D’Anville\r\nconsiders the “Lesser” Rhone to have been the “Spanish” mouth of the\r\nancients. In consequence of the overflowings of this river there is\r\ngreat confusion upon this subject.\r\n\r\n[1086] This mouth of the Rhone was much used by the Massilians for the\r\npurposes of commerce with the interior of Gaul, and the carriage of the\r\nsupplies of tin which they obtained thence.\r\n\r\n[1087] The manner in which Pliny here expresses himself shows that he\r\ndoubts the fact of such a place having even existed; it is mentioned\r\nby none of the preceding geographers, and of those who followed him\r\nStephen of Byzantium is the only one who notices it. An inscription was\r\nfound however in the reign of Charles V. of France, in which it was\r\nstated that Ataulphus, king of the Visigoths, selected Heraclea as his\r\nplace of residence. On the faith of this inscription, Spon and Ducange\r\nhave placed Heraclea at the modern Saint-Gilles, and other writers at\r\nSaint-Remy, where the inscription was found. Unfortunately, however,\r\nMessrs. Devic and Vaissette, in their “History of Languedoc,” have\r\nproved that this inscription is of spurious origin.\r\n\r\n[1088] The “Fossæ Marianæ” are also mentioned by Ptolemy and Solinus;\r\nthough they differ in the situation which they have respectively\r\nassigned them. They were formed by Marius when advancing to dispute the\r\npassage of the Rhone with the Cimbri, who had quitted Spain for the\r\npurpose of passing the Pyrenees and invading Italy, in the year B.C.\r\n102. There is considerable difficulty in determining their position,\r\nbut they are supposed to have commenced at the place now called the\r\nCamp of Marius, and to have terminated at the eastern mouth of the\r\nRhone near the present Arles.\r\n\r\n[1089] Pliny is the first who mentions the name of this lake, though\r\nprevious writers had indicated its existence. Strabo informs us that\r\nabove the mouth of the Rhone there is a large lake that communicates\r\nwith the sea, and abounds in fish and oysters. Brotier and D’Anville\r\nidentify it with the present lake of Martigues or of Berre.\r\n\r\n[1090] D’Anville takes this place to be the present town of Martigues;\r\nBrotier thinks that it was situate on the spot now called Le Cap\r\nd’Œil, near the town of Saint-Chamas; and Bouche, the historian of the\r\nProvince, places it at Marignane, on the east side of the lake already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[1091] “Campi Lapidei,” called by the natives at the present day “La\r\nCrau;” probably from the same Celtic root as our word “Crags;” though\r\nBochart derives it from the Hebrew. Æschylus and Hyginus speak of this\r\ncombat of Hercules, and Mela relates that being engaged in a mortal\r\nstruggle with Albion and Geryon, the sons of Neptune, he invoked the\r\naid of Jupiter, on which a shower of stones fell from the heavens and\r\ndestroyed his antagonists. Those on this plain are said to be the\r\nremains of the stony shower. It is supposed by the scientific that\r\nmany of these stones are aërolites, and that tradition has ingeniously\r\nadapted this story to their real origin. The vicinity of Tunbridge\r\nWells presents a somewhat similar appearance.\r\n\r\n[1092] The people probably of the site of the present isle of Camargue.\r\n\r\n[1093] They probably inhabited the district south of the Durance,\r\nbetween it and the Rhone.\r\n\r\n[1094] They inhabited the country in which the present Avignon, Orange,\r\nCavaillon, and perhaps Carpentras are situate.\r\n\r\n[1095] They are thought by Hardouin to have dwelt in the vicinity of\r\nthe present town of Talard in the department of the Hautes Alpes.\r\n\r\n[1096] They inhabited the eastern part of the departments of the Drôme\r\nand the Vaucluse.\r\n\r\n[1097] Their territory comprehended the southern part of the department\r\nof the Ain, the department of the Isère, the canton of Geneva, and part\r\nof Savoy.\r\n\r\n[1098] It was said to have been colonized from Phocæa, a town of Ionia\r\nin Asia Minor. Lucan in his Third Book more than once falls into the\r\nerror of supposing that it was colonized from Phocis in Greece.\r\n\r\n[1099] We learn from Justin, B. xliii., that this privilege, as well as\r\nothers, and a seat at the public shows, were granted to the Massilians\r\nby the Roman Senate, in return for their sympathy and assistance after\r\nthe city had been taken and plundered by the Gauls.\r\n\r\n[1100] According to D’Anville the present Cap de l’Aigre, though\r\nMannert takes it to be the Cap de la Croisette.\r\n\r\n[1101] D’Anville takes this to be the same as the present Port de la\r\nCiotat.\r\n\r\n[1102] Probably occupying the south-east of the department of the Var.\r\nIt is supposed by Hardouin that the village of Ramatuelle, near the\r\ncoast, south of the Gulf of Grimaud, represents the ancient name; and\r\nD’Anville and other writers are of the same opinion.\r\n\r\n[1103] Probably the country around the modern Brignole and Draguignan\r\nwas inhabited by them.\r\n\r\n[1104] They inhabited Verignon and Barjols in the southern part of the\r\ndepartment of the Var.\r\n\r\n[1105] D’Anville takes this to be the place called Agaï, between Frejus\r\nand La Napoule: but in so doing he disregards the order in which they\r\nare given by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1106] “The Forum of Julius.” Now Frejus. As its name implies, it was\r\na colony of the Eighth Legion. It was probably called ‘Pacensis,’\r\non some occasion when peace had happily been made with the original\r\ninhabitants, and ‘Classica’ from the fleet being stationed there by\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\n[1107] Still known as the Argens, from the silvery appearance of the\r\nwater. It has choked up the harbour with sand, in which probably the\r\nships of Augustus rode at anchor.\r\n\r\n[1108] They inhabited the coast, in the vicinity of the modern Cannes.\r\n\r\n[1109] They are supposed to have inhabited the country of Grasse, in\r\nthe south-east of the department of the Var.\r\n\r\n[1110] According to Ptolemy they had for their capital the town of\r\nSalinæ; which some take to be the modern Saluces, others Castellane,\r\nand others again Seillans, according to Holstein and D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[1111] D’Anville thinks that they lived in the valley of Queyras, in\r\nthe department of the Hautes Alpes, having a town of the same name.\r\n\r\n[1112] The Adunicates are supposed by Hardouin to have inhabited the\r\ndepartment of the Basses Alpes, between the towns of Senez and Digne.\r\n\r\n[1113] The modern Antibes. Mount Cema is the present Monte-Cemelione.\r\n\r\n[1114] “Arelate of the Sixth Legion,” a military colony; now the city\r\nof Arles. It is first mentioned by Cæsar, who had some ships built\r\nthere for the siege of Massilia or Marseilles. It was made a military\r\ncolony in the time of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[1115] “Beterræ of the Seventh Legion.” The modern town of Beziers.\r\n\r\n[1116] “Arausio of the Second Legion,” now Orange, a town in the\r\ndepartment of Vaucluse.\r\n\r\n[1117] Now Valence, in the department of the Drôme.\r\n\r\n[1118] Now Vienne, in the department of the Isère.\r\n\r\n[1119] Aix, in the department of the Bouches du Rhône.\r\n\r\n[1120] Avignon, in the Vaucluse.\r\n\r\n[1121] Apt, in the department of Vaucluse.\r\n\r\n[1122] Riez, in the department of the Basses Alpes.\r\n\r\n[1123] The modern Alps, near Viviers, is probably built on the site of\r\nthis town. The text shows that it was different from Augusta, probably\r\nthe Alba Augusta mentioned by Ptolemy, though D’Anville supposes them\r\nto have been the same place.\r\n\r\n[1124] Some writers take this place to be the present\r\nSaint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux, in the department of the Drôme.\r\n\r\n[1125] Probably so called from its lofty position, and supposed by\r\nD’Anville to have been situate on the modern Mont Ventoux, or “Windy\r\nMountain.” Other writers place it at La Croix Haute, near the city of\r\nAvignon.\r\n\r\n[1126] There is a village in the department of the Var, six leagues\r\nfrom Toulon, called Bormes, not improbably from these people.\r\n\r\n[1127] The modern Cavaillon, in the department of the Vaucluse.\r\n\r\n[1128] Now Carcassone, in the department of the Aude.\r\n\r\n[1129] Probably Saint Tibéry, on the river Hérault.\r\n\r\n[1130] Now Carpentras. Ptolemy also makes mention of the Memini.\r\n\r\n[1131] Probably situate on the river Cœnus of Ptolemy, between the\r\neastern mouth of the Rhone and Massilia. Probably the name in Pliny\r\nshould be “Cœnienses.”\r\n\r\n[1132] Walckenaer places this people in the vicinity of Cambo, in the\r\narrondissement of Bayonne, in the department of the Basses Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n[1133] In names similar to this, as Festus remarks, “Forum” has the\r\nmeaning of “Market;” much as that word is used as a compound in our\r\nnames, such as Market Drayton, &c. Bouche thinks that by this place is\r\nmeant the modern Le Canet: but D’Anville takes it to be Gonfaron, a\r\ncorruption, he thinks, of Voconfaron from the Latin name.\r\n\r\n[1134] The site of Glanum was about a mile to the south of the village\r\nof Saint Remi, between Cavaillon and Arles. On the spot there are the\r\nremains of a Roman mausoleum and a triumphal arch.\r\n\r\n[1135] The people of Luteva, now Lodève, in the department of the\r\nHérault.\r\n\r\n[1136] “The people of Forum Neronis,” which place has been supposed\r\nby some to have been the same with Carpentoracte: D’Anville supposes\r\nForcalquier to have been Forum Neronis, while Walckenaer takes Momas\r\nto have been that place. From the text it would appear to have been\r\nidentical with Luteva.\r\n\r\n[1137] The modern Nismes, which in its ruins contains abundant marks\r\nof its ancient splendour. The family of the Antonines came from this\r\nplace. The remains of its aqueduct still survive, containing three rows\r\nof arches, one above the other, and 180 feet in height.\r\n\r\n[1138] The people of the present Pézenas, in the department of the\r\nHérault.\r\n\r\n[1139] Their chief town is supposed to have been Albiga, now Albi, in\r\nthe department of Tarn.\r\n\r\n[1140] The inhabitants of the present Senez in the Basses Alpes.\r\nDe la Saussaye says that their coins read ‘Samnagenses,’ and not\r\n‘Sanagenses,’ and that they inhabited Senas, a town in the vicinity of\r\nAix.\r\n\r\n[1141] Their chief town was Tolosa, now Toulouse, in the department of\r\nthe Haute-Garonne.\r\n\r\n[1142] They probably lived in the vicinity of the present Montauban, in\r\nthe department of the Tarn et Garonne.\r\n\r\n[1143] Probably the inhabitants of the site of the modern town of\r\nTarascon. There is, however, considerable doubt as to these two names.\r\n\r\n[1144] Poinsinet thinks that they occupied Vabres, a place situate in\r\nthe south of the department of Aveyron.\r\n\r\n[1145] Now Vaison, in the department of Vaucluse.\r\n\r\n[1146] “The Grove of Augustus.” This town appears to have been\r\noverflowed by the river Druma, which formed a lake on its site. Its\r\nremains were still to be seen in the lake in modern times, and from it\r\nthe town on the margin of the lake takes its name of Le Luc.\r\n\r\n[1147] Under the name “formula” Pliny perhaps alludes to the official\r\nlist of the Roman government, which he had consulted for the purposes\r\nof accuracy.\r\n\r\n[1148] Bouche places the site of this people at the village of Avançon,\r\nbetween Chorges and Gap, in the department of the Hautes Alpes.\r\n\r\n[1149] The present town of Digne, in the department of the Basses Alpes.\r\n\r\n[1150] It is not known from what points these measurements of our\r\nauthor are taken.\r\n\r\n[1151] The modern names of these localities will form the subject of\r\nconsideration when we proceed, in c. 7, to a more minute description of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n[1152] This passage is somewhat confused, and may possibly be in a\r\ncorrupt state. He here speaks of the Apennine Alps. By the “lunata\r\njuga” he means the two promontories or capes, which extend east and\r\nwest respectively.\r\n\r\n[1153] This seems to be the meaning of “alumna,” and not “nurse” or\r\n“foster-mother,” as Ajasson’s translation has it. Pliny probably\r\nimplies by this antithesis that Rome has been “twice blessed,” in\r\nreceiving the bounties of all nations of the world, and in being able\r\nto bestow a commensurate return. Compared with this idea, “at once the\r\nnurse and mother of the world” would be tame indeed!\r\n\r\n[1154] By adding its deified emperors to the number of its divinities.\r\nAfter what Pliny has said in his Second Book, this looks very much like\r\npure adulation.\r\n\r\n[1155] Or “Great Greece.” This is a poor and frivolous argument used\r\nby Pliny in support of his laudations of Italy, seeing that in all\r\nprobability it was not the people of Greece who gave this name to\r\ncertain cities founded by Greek colonists on the Tarentine Gulf, in the\r\nsouth of Italy; but either the Italian tribes, who in their simplicity\r\nadmired their splendour and magnificence, or else the colonists\r\nthemselves, who, in using the name, showed that they clung with\r\nfondness to the remembrance of their mother-country; while at the same\r\ntime the epithet betrayed some vanity and ostentation in wishing thus\r\nto show their superiority to the people of their mother-country.\r\n\r\n[1156] The comparison of its shape to an oak leaf seems rather\r\nfanciful; more common-place observers have compared it to a boot: by\r\nthe top (cacumen) he seems to mean the southern part of Calabria about\r\nBrundisium and Tarentum; which, to a person facing the south, would\r\nincline to the coast of Epirus on the left hand.\r\n\r\n[1157] The ‘Parma’ or shield here alluded to, would be one shaped like\r\na crescent, with the exception that the inner or concave side would be\r\nformed of two crescents, the extremities of which join at the central\r\nprojection. He says that Cocinthos (now Capo di Stilo) would in such\r\ncase form the central projection, while Lacinium (now Capo delle\r\nColonne) would form the horn at the extreme right, and Leucopetra (now\r\nCapo dell’ Armi) the horn on the extreme left.\r\n\r\n[1158] The Tuscan or Etrurian sea, and the Adriatic.\r\n\r\n[1159] The Varus, as already mentioned, was in Gallia Narbonensis,\r\nwhile the Arsia, now the Arsa, is a small river of Istria, which became\r\nthe boundary between Italy and Illyricum, when Istria was annexed by\r\norder of Augustus to the former country. It flows into the Flanaticus\r\nSinus, now Golfo di Quarnero, on the eastern coast of Istria, beyond\r\nthe town of Castel Nuovo, formerly Nesactium.\r\n\r\n[1160] Now the Pescara.\r\n\r\n[1161] Now Palo, a city on the coast of Etruria, eighteen miles from\r\nPortus Augusti, at the mouth of the Tiber.\r\n\r\n[1162] This distance is overstated: the circuit is in reality about\r\n2500 miles.\r\n\r\n[1163] For instance, from Pola to Ravenna, and from Iadera to Ancona.\r\n\r\n[1164] Sardinia is in no part nearer to Italy than 140 miles.\r\n\r\n[1165] Issa, now Lissa, is an island of the Adriatic, off the coast of\r\nLiburnia; it is not less than eighty miles distant from the nearest\r\npart of the coast of Italy.\r\n\r\n[1166] That is to say, the south, which was so called by the Romans:\r\nthe meaning being that Italy extends in a south-easterly direction.\r\n\r\n[1167] Italy was divided by Augustus into eleven districts; the ninth\r\nof which nearly corresponded to the former republic of Genoa.\r\n\r\n[1168] The modern Nizza of the Italians, or Nice of the French.\r\n\r\n[1169] Now the Paglione.\r\n\r\n[1170] Livy mentions four of these tribes, the Celelates, the\r\nCerdiciates, the Apuani, and the Friniates.\r\n\r\n[1171] Or “Long-haired.” Lucan, B. i. l. 442, 3, refers to this\r\ncharacteristic of the Alpine Ligurians:\r\n\r\n  Et nunc tonse Ligur, quondam per colla decora\r\n  Crinibus effusis toti prælate Comatæ.\r\n\r\n[1172] It is probably the ruins of this place that are to be seen at\r\nthe present day at Cimiez in the vicinity of Nice.\r\n\r\n[1173] The modern Monaco.\r\n\r\n[1174] These tribes have been already mentioned in c. 5, as belonging\r\nto the province of Gallia Narbonensis.\r\n\r\n[1175] It is supposed that they dwelt near the present Vinadio in\r\nPiedmont.\r\n\r\n[1176] It is supposed that they inhabited the vicinity of the present\r\ntown of Chorges, between Embrun and Gap.\r\n\r\n[1177] They probably dwelt near the modern town of Montserrat.\r\n\r\n[1178] They probably dwelt near the modern Biela, eight leagues from\r\nVerceil in Piedmont.\r\n\r\n[1179] Some writers place them near the modern city of Casale.\r\n\r\n[1180] Their locality is supposed by some writers to be near the\r\npresent Cortemiglia, five leagues from the town of Alba.\r\n\r\n[1181] Now the Roya, flowing between very high banks.—Lucan, B. ii. l.\r\n422, speaks of the Rutuba as “Cavus,” “flowing in deep cavities.”\r\n\r\n[1182] Probably the present Vintimiglia.\r\n\r\n[1183] The modern Arozia.\r\n\r\n[1184] The present town of Albenga.—Livy, B. xxix. c. 5, calls the\r\ninhabitants Albingauni.\r\n\r\n[1185] Now called Vaï or Ve, and Savona.\r\n\r\n[1186] The modern Bisagna, which waters Genua, the modern Genoa.\r\n\r\n[1187] Now the Lavagna, which also washes Genoa.\r\n\r\n[1188] “The Port of the Dolphin;” now Porto Fino.\r\n\r\n[1189] Probably the ruins called those of Tregesa or Trigoso are those\r\nof Tigullia.\r\n\r\n[1190] Now Sestri di Levante.\r\n\r\n[1191] The modern Magra.\r\n\r\n[1192] Of which they were considered as a chain, and called the\r\nApennine Alps.\r\n\r\n[1193] Now the Po.\r\n\r\n[1194] According to D’Anville, now Castel Arqua.\r\n\r\n[1195] Now Tortona. It was a city of importance, and there are\r\nconsiderable ruins still in existence.\r\n\r\n[1196] The modern Voghera, upon the river Staffora.\r\n\r\n[1197] Probably the present Verrua.\r\n\r\n[1198] Called by the Ligurians Bodincomagus, by the Romans Industria.\r\nIts remains are to be found at Monteù di Po, a few miles below\r\nChevasso, on the right bank of the river.\r\n\r\n[1199] The modern Pollenza, a small town on the river Tenaro near Alba.\r\n\r\n[1200] Its site has been placed at Chieri near Turin, and at Carrù\r\non the Tanaro, a few miles south of Bene, which is perhaps the most\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\n[1201] The modern Valenza.\r\n\r\n[1202] Placed by D’Anville at Vico near Mondovi, and by other writers\r\nat Carmagnole and Saluzzo: but Durandi has shown that the ruins still\r\nto be seen near Bene in Piedmont are those of Augusta Vagiennorum. Bene\r\nis supposed to be a corruption of Bagienna, the name of the town in the\r\nmiddle ages. The name of the Vagienni also probably survives in that of\r\nViozenna, an obscure place in that vicinity.\r\n\r\n[1203] Still called Alba; a town near the northern foot of the\r\nApennines. It probably had its appellation from Cn. Pompeius Strabo,\r\nthe father of Pompey the Great, who conferred many privileges on the\r\nCisalpine Gauls. It was the birth-place of the Emperor Helvius Pertinax.\r\n\r\n[1204] The modern Aste.\r\n\r\n[1205] The modern Acqui, so called from its mineral springs. It is\r\nagain mentioned by Pliny in B. XXXI. Numerous remains of the ancient\r\ntown have been discovered.\r\n\r\n[1206] Ansart observes that this measurement is nearly correct.\r\n\r\n[1207] For an account of this see Herodotus, B. i. c. 94, Tacitus, Ann.\r\nB. iv. c. 55, and Velleius Paterculus, B. i. c. 1. These writers all\r\nagree as to the fact of the migration of a colony of Lydians under the\r\nconduct of Tyrrhenus to the part of Italy afterwards called Etruria.\r\nThis subject however, as well as the migrations of the Pelasgi, is\r\ninvolved in the greatest obscurity.\r\n\r\n[1208] From the Greek verb θύειν “to sacrifice,” he implies:—from\r\ntheir custom of frequently sacrificing, says Servius, on the Xth Book\r\nof the Æneid. Dionysius of Halicarnassus says that they were from\r\ntheir frequent sacrifices called θυόσκοοι. These are probably fanciful\r\nderivations; but there is no doubt that the people of Etruria were\r\nfor several centuries the instructors of the Romans in the arts of\r\nsacrifice, augury, and divination.\r\n\r\n[1209] The ruins of Luna, which was destroyed by the Normans in the\r\nmiddle ages, are still visible on the banks of the Magra. The modern\r\nname of the port is Golfo della Spezzia.\r\n\r\n[1210] The modern city of Lucca has its site and name.—Livy, B. xli.\r\nc. 13, informs us that this colony was founded in the year of the city\r\n576, during the Consulship of Claudius Pulcher and Sempronius Gracchus.\r\n\r\n[1211] The modern city of Pisa. See Virgil, B. x. l. 179, as to the\r\norigin of this place.\r\n\r\n[1212] The modern Serchio.\r\n\r\n[1213] Now the Arno.\r\n\r\n[1214] The people of Pisa or Pisæ, a city of Elis in the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\n[1215] Now Vadi, a small village on the sea-shore.\r\n\r\n[1216] Still called the Cecina. It entered the Tyrrhenian sea, near the\r\nport of Vada Volaterrana just mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1217] The present Piombino is supposed to have arisen from the ruins\r\nof this place.\r\n\r\n[1218] Now the Bruno.\r\n\r\n[1219] The modern Ombrone.\r\n\r\n[1220] Now known as Telamone Vecchio.\r\n\r\n[1221] There are ruins near lake Orbitello, which bear the name of\r\nCosa; Ansedonia was said to have risen from its ruins, and in its turn\r\nfallen to decay.\r\n\r\n[1222] Two localities have been mentioned as the site of Graviscæ, at\r\nboth of which there are ancient remains: one on the right bank of the\r\nMarta, about a mile from its mouth, and the other on the sea-coast at\r\na spot called Santo Clementino or Le Saline, a mile south of the mouth\r\nof the Marta. Probably the latter are the remains of Graviscæ, although\r\nDennis (Etruria, i. pp. 387-395) inclines to be in favour of the former.\r\n\r\n[1223] The modern Torre Chiaruccia, five miles south of Civita Vecchia.\r\n\r\n[1224] The modern Torre di Santa Severa.\r\n\r\n[1225] Now the Vaccina.\r\n\r\n[1226] The remains of this once powerful city are marked by the village\r\nof Cervetri or Old Cære. According to Strabo it received its name from\r\nthe Greek word χαῖρε “hail!” with which the inhabitants saluted the\r\nTyrrhenian or Lydian invaders. It was to this place that the Romans\r\nsent their most precious sacred relics when their city was taken by the\r\nGauls. Its most interesting remains are the sepulchres, of which an\r\naccount is given in Dennis’s Etruria.\r\n\r\n[1227] Its remains are to be seen in the vicinity of the modern village\r\nof Palo.\r\n\r\n[1228] Its site is supposed to have been at the spot now called the\r\nTorre di Maccarese, midway between Palo and Porto, and at the mouth of\r\nthe river Arone. Its situation was marshy and unhealthy.\r\n\r\n[1229] This exceeds the real distance, which is about 230 miles.\r\n\r\n[1230] The site of the Etruscan Falerii or Falisci is probably occupied\r\nby the present Civita Castellana; while that of the Roman city of the\r\nsame name, at a distance of four miles, is marked by a single house and\r\nthe ruins of a church, called Santa Maria di Falleri. The ancient city\r\nwas captured by the Romans under Camillus.\r\n\r\n[1231] In his book of “Origines,” which is now lost.\r\n\r\n[1232] “The Grove of Feronia.” The town was so called from the grove\r\nof that Sabine goddess there situate. In the early times of Rome there\r\nwas a great resort to this spot not only for religious purposes, but\r\nfor those of trade as well. Its traces are still to be seen at the\r\nvillage of Saint Orestes, near the south-east extremity of the hill\r\nthere, which is still called Felonica. This is in southern Etruria,\r\nbut Ptolemy mentions another place of the same name in the north-west\r\nextremity of Etruria, between the Arnus and the Macra.\r\n\r\n[1233] The people of the spot now called Siena, in Tuscany.\r\n\r\n[1234] Now Sutri, on the river Pozollo.\r\n\r\n[1235] The people of Arretium, one of the most powerful cities of\r\nEtruria. The three tribes or peoples here mentioned probably did\r\nnot occupy distinct towns, but constituted separate communities or\r\nmunicipal bodies, being distinct colonies or bodies of settlers. The\r\nJulienses were the colonists settled there by Augustus. The Fidentes\r\nhad probably settled at an earlier period. The modern Arezzo has\r\nrisen on the remains of the Roman city, while the remains of the\r\nEtruscan city are pointed out on an elevated spot called Poggio di\r\nSan Cornellio, two or three miles south-east of Arezzo. Many valuable\r\nrelics of antiquity have been discovered here. The family of Mæcenas\r\nsprang from this place.\r\n\r\n[1236] The people of Aquæ Tauri, a watering-place of Etruria, situate\r\nabout three miles north of the present Civita Vecchia, and now called\r\nBagni di Ferrata. The baths are described by Rutilius in his Itinerary,\r\nwho calls them Tauri Thermæ (the Bull’s Baths), and ascribes their name\r\nto the fact of their having been accidentally discovered by a bull.\r\n\r\n[1237] The people of Blera, on the site of the modern village of Bieda,\r\nabout twelve miles south of Viterbo. Numerous remains of Etruscan\r\nantiquity have been found here.—See Dennis’s Etruria, vol. i. pp.\r\n260-272.\r\n\r\n[1238] The people of Cortona, a powerful city of Etruria, which is\r\nstill known by the same name. It was probably in the number of the\r\ncities of Etruria that were ravaged by Sylla, and then recolonized by\r\nhim. Numerous remains of Etruscan antiquity have been discovered there.\r\n\r\n[1239] The people of Capena, an ancient and important city of Etruria,\r\nwhich, after long opposing the inroads of the Romans, was reduced to\r\nsubmission shortly after the fall of Veii, B.C. 393. It existed and\r\nheld municipal rank till the time of the Emperor Aurelian, after which\r\nall traces of its name or existence were lost, till 1750, when Galetti\r\nfixed its site with great accuracy at Civitucola or San Martino, about\r\n24 miles from Rome. It was situate on the banks of a small river now\r\ncalled the Grammiccia, and in its territory was the celebrated ‘Lucus\r\nFeroniæ’ previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1240] The new and old colonists of the city of Clusium, who probably\r\nenjoyed distinct municipal rights. The modern Chiusi stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1241] The modern Fiorenze or Florence occupies the site of their city.\r\n\r\n[1242] The village of Fiesole stands on its site. Extensive remains of\r\nthe ancient city are still to be found.\r\n\r\n[1243] The site of Ferentinum is now uninhabited, but is still known\r\nby the name of Ferento. The rivers of the ancient city are very\r\nconsiderable; it was finally destroyed by the people of Viterbo in the\r\n12th century.\r\n\r\n[1244] An ancient town of Etruria near Falisci. Cluver thinks that\r\nit was situate at Gallese, a village nine miles north of Civita\r\nCastellana; but Dennis considers its site to have been between\r\nBorghetto on the Tiber and Corchiano, where there are considerable\r\nremains of an Etruscan city. The spot is named San Silvestro, from a\r\nruined church there.\r\n\r\n[1245] Or Horta; the spot now called Orte, where numerous Etruscan\r\nremains are found; it probably derived its name from the Etruscan\r\ngoddess Horta. Hortanum, the name given to it by Pliny, is perhaps an\r\nadjective form of the name, “oppidum” being understood.\r\n\r\n[1246] Possibly the same as ‘Urbs Vetus,’ on the side of which the\r\npresent Orvieto stands.\r\n\r\n[1247] Now Nepi, near the river Pozzolo.\r\n\r\n[1248] According to Hardouin the site of the Novem Pagi, or nine\r\nBoroughs, is occupied by the modern Il Mignone, near Civita Vecchia.\r\n\r\n[1249] Its site is generally supposed to have been at Oriuolo, about\r\nfive miles north of Bracciano; but Dennis informs us that there are no\r\nancient remains at that place. Being a præfecture it may have consisted\r\nof only a number of little villages, united in one jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n[1250] The modern Pistoia stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1251] Now Perugia.\r\n\r\n[1252] Supposed by Hardouin to have inhabited the site of the modern\r\nSovretto.\r\n\r\n[1253] Probably situate in the modern duchy of Castro.\r\n\r\n[1254] The people of Tarquinii near Rome, the head of the Etruscan\r\nconfederation. It was here that Demaratus the Corinthian, the father\r\nof Tarquinius Priscus, settled. It was deserted by its inhabitants in\r\nthe eighth or ninth century, who founded the town of Corneto on a hill\r\nopposite to it. The ruins are known as Turchina, a corruption of the\r\nancient name.\r\n\r\n[1255] The site of their town is probably marked by the modern\r\nToscanella.\r\n\r\n[1256] The ruins of their town still retain somewhat of their ancient\r\nname in that of “Vetulia.”\r\n\r\n[1257] The people of the powerful city of Veii, subdued by Camillus.\r\nIts ruins have been discovered in the vicinity of the village of Isola\r\nFarnese.\r\n\r\n[1258] Their town stood on the site of the present Bisontia.\r\n\r\n[1259] The people of Volaterræ, the present Volterra, one of the twelve\r\ncities of the Etruscan Confederation. It was for a time the residence\r\nof the kings of Lombardy. The modern town covers only a small portion\r\nof the area of the ancient city, of which there are some interesting\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n[1260] The people of Volci or Vulci, of which the ruins bear the same\r\nname. Its sepulchres have produced vast treasures of ancient art.\r\n\r\n[1261] The people of Volsinii or Vulsinii, now called Bolsena. This\r\nwas one of the most ancient and powerful of the twelve cities of the\r\nEtruscan confederation. On their subjugation by the Romans the Etruscan\r\ncity was destroyed, and its inhabitants were compelled to settle on a\r\nless defensible site. The new city was the birth-place of Sejanus, the\r\nworthless favourite of Tiberius. Of the ancient city there are scarcely\r\nany remains.\r\n\r\n[1262] Called also Crustumeria, Crustumium, and Crustuminium. It was a\r\ncity of Latium on the borders of the Sabine country, and was subdued\r\nby Romulus, though it afterwards appears as independent in the time\r\nof Tarquinius Priscus. The territory was noted for its fertility. The\r\nexact site of the city is unknown; a place called Marcigliana Vecchia,\r\nabout nine miles from Rome, seems the most probable.\r\n\r\n[1263] The site of Caletra is quite unknown. It was situate at some\r\npoint in the present valley of the Albegna.\r\n\r\n[1264] The First Region extended from the Tiber to the Gulf of\r\nSalernum, being bounded in the interior by the Apennines. It consisted\r\nof ancient Latium and Campania, comprising the modern Campagna di Roma,\r\nand the provinces of the kingdom of Naples.\r\n\r\n[1265] Livy, B. i. c. 3, and Ovid, Fasti, B. iii. l. 389, inform us\r\nthat the name of Albula was changed into Tiberis in consequence of king\r\nTiberinus being accidentally drowned in it.\r\n\r\n[1266] Still known by that name. The Glanis is called la Chiana.\r\n\r\n[1267] According to D’Anville, now known as Citta di Castello.\r\n\r\n[1268] A municipal town of Umbria, situate near the confluence of the\r\nrivers Nar and Tiber, and on the Flaminian Way. There are the ruins of\r\nan aqueduct, an amphitheatre, and some temples, now the modern Otricoli.\r\n\r\n[1269] The territory of Umbria extended from the left bank of the\r\nTiber, near its rise, to the Adriatic.\r\n\r\n[1270] The Sabines occupied the left bank of the Tiber from the Umbri\r\nto the Anio. The Crustumini and the Fidenates probably occupied the\r\nsouthern part of the district about the river Alba.\r\n\r\n[1271] The Nera and the Teverone. The exact situation of the district\r\nof Vaticanum has not been ascertained with exactness.\r\n\r\n[1272] As not so much causing mischief by its inundations, as giving\r\nwarning thereby of the wrath of the gods and of impending dangers;\r\nwhich might be arrested by sacrifices and expiatory rites.—See Horace,\r\nOdes, B. i. 2. 29.\r\n\r\n[1273] The frontier of ancient Latium was at Circeii, but that of\r\nmodern Latium extended to Sinuessa.\r\n\r\n[1274] A town of Latium, situate at the foot of the Mons Circeius, now\r\nMonte Circello. It was used as a place of retirement, and Tiberius and\r\nDomitian had villas there. The Triumvir Lepidus was banished thither\r\nby Octavius after his deposition. It was also famous for its oysters,\r\nwhich were of the finest quality. Considerable remains of it are still\r\nto be seen on the hill called Monte di Citadella, about two miles from\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n[1275] Now the Garigliano, the same river which he previously calls the\r\nGlanis. It was the boundary between Latium and Campania.\r\n\r\n[1276] Founded by Ancus Martius, as we learn from Livy. It was\r\nabandoned under the Emperor Claudius, who built the Portus Romanus or\r\nPortus Augusti in its vicinity; and it only continued famous for its\r\nsalt-works, which had been established there by Ancus Martius. Its\r\nruins, still called Ostia, are nearly three miles from the coast, in\r\nconsequence of the receding of the sea.\r\n\r\n[1277] Now San Lorenzo. It was between Ostia and Antium.\r\n\r\n[1278] By some, Æneas was supposed to have been worshiped by that name.\r\n\r\n[1279] Now the river Numico.\r\n\r\n[1280] The ruins of this once great city may still be seen near\r\nthe present village of the same name. Its situation was peculiarly\r\nunhealthy. Another tradition, besides the one mentioned by Pliny, was,\r\nthat it was founded by a son of Ulysses and Circe. It was twenty-four\r\nmiles distant from Rome.\r\n\r\n[1281] A temple of Venus, of which the ruins are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1282] Its few ruins are still known as Anzio Rovinato. It was famous\r\nfor its temple of Fortune, addressed by Horace, Odes, i. 35. Near the\r\nsite is the modern village of Porto d’Anzo.\r\n\r\n[1283] This island was occupied by villas of the Roman nobility, and\r\nwas the resort of Cicero, Augustus and Tiberius. There is still a\r\nfortified town called the Torre di Astura.\r\n\r\n[1284] The modern Ninfa.\r\n\r\n[1285] “The Roman Bulwarks.” They were thrown up to protect the\r\nfrontier of the ancient kingdom of Rome from the inroads of the\r\nVolscians.\r\n\r\n[1286] To our previous note we may add that this spot was supposed to\r\nhave been once inhabited by the enchantress Circe, the daughter of the\r\nSun, and from her to have taken its name.\r\n\r\n[1287] This has been also translated “dedicated to Nicodorus, the\r\nArchon of Athens,” but nothing appears to be known of such a fact as\r\nthe dedication to Nicodorus of any of his works.\r\n\r\n[1288] Now called the “Palude Pontine.” They are again mentioned in B.\r\nxxvi. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[1289] Now called Il Portatore.\r\n\r\n[1290] It was situate fifty-eight miles from Rome; the modern town of\r\nTerracina stands on its site. The remains of the ancient citadel are\r\nvisible on the slope of Montecchio.\r\n\r\n[1291] The exact site of this place is unknown. Servius, in his\r\nCommentary on B. x. of the Æneid, l. 564, tells the same story of the\r\nserpents.\r\n\r\n[1292] This was near Amyclæ. A villa was situate there called\r\n“Speluncæ,” from the cavities in the rock, in one of which the Emperor\r\nTiberius nearly lost his life by the falling in of the roof. The modern\r\nvillage of Sperlonga, eight miles west of Gaëta, marks its site.\r\n\r\n[1293] Now Lago di Fondi.\r\n\r\n[1294] Now Gaëta, said to have received its name from being the\r\nburial-place of Caieta, the nurse of Æneas. The shore was studded\r\nwith numerous villas of the Roman nobility. It is now a city of great\r\nopulence; in its vicinity extensive ruins are to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1295] On the spot now called Mola di Gaëta. Many of the wealthy\r\nRomans, and among them Cicero, had villas here: and at this place he\r\nwas put to death. It was destroyed by the Saracens in the year 856. The\r\nremains of antiquity to be seen on this spot are very extensive.\r\n\r\n[1296] Homer places these Cannibals on the coast of Sicily, but the\r\nRomans in general transplanted them to the vicinity of Circeii, and\r\nsuppose Formiæ to have been built by Lamus, one of their kings. It is\r\nmore probable however that it was founded by the Laconians, from whom\r\nit may have received its name of Hormiæ (from the Greek ὅρμος), as\r\nbeing a good roadstead for shipping.\r\n\r\n[1297] Its site is occupied by the present Trajetta. In its marshes,\r\nformed by the overflow of the Liris, Caius Marius was taken prisoner,\r\nconcealed in the sedge.\r\n\r\n[1298] The town of Minturnæ stood on both banks of the river.\r\n\r\n[1299] Its ruins are probably those to be seen in the vicinity of Rocca\r\ndi Mondragone. It was a place of considerable commercial importance. On\r\nits site Livy says there formerly stood the Greek city of Sinope.\r\n\r\n[1300] “Felix illa Campania.”\r\n\r\n[1301] Now Sezza.\r\n\r\n[1302] A marshy district of Latium, extending about eight miles along\r\nthe coast from Terracina to Speluncæ, famous in the time of Horace for\r\nthe first-rate qualities of its wines.\r\n\r\n[1303] A district famous for its wines, extending from the Massican\r\nHills to the north bank of the Volturnus.\r\n\r\n[1304] According to Hardouin, the town of Calenum was on the site of\r\nthe present Calvi near Capua.\r\n\r\n[1305] Now called Monte Marsico, and as famous for its wine (called\r\nMuscatella) as it was in the Roman times.\r\n\r\n[1306] Now Monte Barbaro. The wines of most of these places will be\r\nfound fully described by Pliny in B. xiv.\r\n\r\n[1307] More fully mentioned, B. xviii. c. 29, where the ‘alicæ’ or\r\nfermenty made from the spelt grown here is again referred to.\r\n\r\n[1308] Of Baiæ, Puteoli, and Stabiæ, for instance.\r\n\r\n[1309] The modern Saove.\r\n\r\n[1310] Now called the Volturno, with a small place on its banks called\r\nCastel Volturno.\r\n\r\n[1311] The present village of Torre di Patria is supposed to occupy its\r\nsite.\r\n\r\n[1312] Strabo describes Cumæ as a joint colony of the Chalcidians of\r\nEubœa and the Cymæans of Æolis. Its sea-shore was covered with villas\r\nof the Roman aristocracy, and here Sylla spent the last years of\r\nhis life. Its site is now utterly desolate and its existing remains\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\n[1313] Now Capo or Punta di Miseno; a town built on a promontory of\r\nCampania, by Æneas, it was said, in honour of his trumpeter, Misenus,\r\nwho was drowned there. It was made by Augustus the principal station\r\nof the Roman fleet. Here was the villa of Marius, which afterwards\r\nbelonged to Lucullus and the Emperor Tiberius, who died here.\r\n\r\n[1314] Famous for its warm springs, and the luxurious resort of the\r\nRoman patricians. Marius, Lucullus, Pompey, and Cæsar had villas\r\nhere. In later times it became the seat of every kind of pleasure and\r\ndissipation. It is now rendered unwholesome by the Malaria, and the\r\nmodern Castello di Baja, with numerous ruins, alone marks its site.\r\n\r\n[1315] The modern village of Baolo stands near its site. It was here\r\nthat Hortensius had his fish-ponds, mentioned by Pliny in B. ix. c.\r\n55. It rivalled its neighbour Baiæ in ministering to the luxury of the\r\nwealthy Romans, and was occupied by numerous villas so late as the\r\nreign of Theodosius.\r\n\r\n[1316] Probably the inner part of the Gulf of Cumæ or Puteoli, but\r\nseparated from the remainder by an embankment eight stadia in length.\r\nIt was famous for its oyster-beds. Behind it was the Lake Avernus,\r\noccupying the crater of an extinct volcano, and supposed by the\r\nGreeks to be the entrance to the Infernal Regions. Agrippa opened a\r\ncommunication with the Lucrine Lake to render Lake Avernus accessible\r\nto ships. The Lucrine Lake was filled up by a volcanic eruption in\r\n1538, and a mountain rose in its place. The Lake Avernus is still\r\ncalled the Lago di Averno.\r\n\r\n[1317] Or “the town Cimmerium.” Nothing is known of it.\r\n\r\n[1318] Now Pozzuolo. The Romans called it Puteoli, from the strong\r\nsmell of its mineral springs. There are still many ruins of the ancient\r\ntown, which was destroyed by Alaric, Genseric, and Totila, and as many\r\ntimes rebuilt.\r\n\r\n[1319] Now called Salpatara. This was the name given to the volcanic\r\nplain extending from Cumæ to Capua, and supposed to have been once\r\ncovered with fire; whence the name, from φλέγω, “to burn.”\r\n\r\n[1320] Now the Lago di Fusaro. It seems to have had its name from its\r\nvicinity to Avernus, the supposed entrance to the infernal regions. Its\r\nbanks were, in the later times of the Roman republic, adorned with the\r\nvillas of the wealthy.\r\n\r\n[1321] Neapolis, or the “New City,” was founded by the Chalcidians of\r\nCumæ on the site of Parthenope, the supposed burial-place of the Siren\r\nof that name. It was so called as being only a ‘new quarter’ of the\r\nneighbouring city of Cumæ. The modern city of Naples stands nearly on\r\nits site.\r\n\r\n[1322] Said to have been founded by Hercules. It was on the occasion of\r\nits destruction by an eruption of Vesuvius, A.D. 79, that our author\r\nunfortunately met his death, a martyr to his thirst for knowledge.\r\nIts closer proximity to Vesuvius caused it to be buried under a more\r\nsolid body of materials ejected from the mountain than was the case\r\nwith Pompeii; which seems to have been suffocated with ashes, while\r\nHerculaneum was covered with volcanic tufa most probably hardened by\r\nthe agency of water. A few scattered inhabitants are supposed to have\r\nafterwards settled upon the site where it was buried, which for many\r\ncenturies was utterly forgotten, till brought to light in 1738. Part of\r\nthe site over the buried town is occupied by the villages of Resina and\r\nPortici. The works of art found here far exceed in value and interest\r\nthose discovered at Pompeii.\r\n\r\n[1323] This seems to have been a town of Oscan origin. The first traces\r\nof it were found in 1689, but excavations were not commenced till 1721.\r\nIt perished in the same eruption of Vesuvius as Herculaneum.\r\n\r\n[1324] Now the Sarno. Its course was changed by the great eruption of\r\nVesuvius previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1325] The modern Nocera stands on its site. Pompeii was used as its\r\nharbour.\r\n\r\n[1326] Now Sorrento.\r\n\r\n[1327] Now also called Capo della Minerva.\r\n\r\n[1328] It probably had its name from Campania, of which it was the\r\ncapital, and which was so called from its extensive _campi_ or plains.\r\nThe site of this luxurious and magnificent city is now occupied by the\r\nvillage of Santa Maria di Capoua, the modern city of Capua being on the\r\nsite of ancient Casilinum. Of ancient Capua there are but few remains.\r\nIt was made a Roman colony by Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\n[1329] Originally a city of the Volscians: Cicero had a villa there,\r\nand Juvenal and the emperor Pescennius Niger were natives of it. The\r\npresent Aquino stands on its site, and there are considerable remains\r\nof it to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1330] Or Suessa Aurunca, to distinguish it from the Volscian city of\r\nSuessa Pometia. The poet Lucilius was a native of it. The modern Sessa\r\nstands in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[1331] The modern Venafri stands near its site. It was famous for the\r\nexcellence of its olives.\r\n\r\n[1332] On the banks of the Suris, and the most northerly town of the\r\nVolsci. The modern Sora is in its vicinity, and the remains of its\r\nwalls are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1333] The modern Teano occupies its site. It was famous for the\r\nmedicinal springs in its vicinity. There was another Teanum, in Apulia.\r\n\r\n[1334] The town on its site still preserves the name. Bells were made\r\nhere, whence in the later writers they are called “Nolæ.” There is also\r\nan ecclesiastical tradition that church bells were first used by Saint\r\nPaulinus, bishop of this place, whence they were called ‘Campanæ.’ The\r\nemperor Augustus died here.\r\n\r\n[1335] The remains of the ancient town, of which the ruins are\r\nvery extensive, are called Avella Vecchia. It was famous for its\r\nfruit, especially its filberts, to which it gives name in the French\r\n“Avelines.” It was first a Greek colony, and then a town of the Oscans.\r\n\r\n[1336] A city of Latium, sixteen miles from Rome, and said to have been\r\nof Sicilian origin. The modern town of La Riccia occupies the site of\r\nits citadel. It was celebrated for the temple and grove of Diana, whose\r\nhigh priest was always a fugitive slave who had killed his predecessor,\r\nand was called “Rex nemorensis,” or “king of the grove.” See Ovid,\r\nFasti, B. vi. l. 59; Art of Love, B. i. l. 260; and Lucan, B. vi. l. 74.\r\n\r\n[1337] The ancient city was destroyed by Tullus Hostilius, king of\r\nRome. The Roman colony here was probably but small. The Roman patrician\r\nfamilies, the Julii, Servilii, Tullii, and Quintii, are said to have\r\nmigrated from Alba Longa, which, according to tradition, had given to\r\nRome her first king.\r\n\r\n[1338] The people of Acerra, still called by the same name; it was\r\nplundered and burnt by Hannibal, B.C. 216, but was rebuilt by order of\r\nthe Roman senate.\r\n\r\n[1339] The people of Allifæ, a former city of Samnium, on the borders\r\nof Campania. The modern city of Alife, a decayed place, stands on its\r\nsite. There are considerable remains.\r\n\r\n[1340] The people of Atina, an ancient city of the Volscians. The\r\nmodern city of Atina, noted for the bleakness of its situation, stands\r\non its site. There are extensive ruins of the ancient city.\r\n\r\n[1341] The people of Aletrium or Alatrium, an ancient city of the\r\nHernici. The modern Alatri stands on its site; there are but few\r\nancient remains.\r\n\r\n[1342] The people of Anagnia in Latium, still called Anagni. There are\r\nscarcely any remains of the ancient place, which was of considerable\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n[1343] The people of Atella, an ancient city of Campania. Some remains\r\nof its ruins are to be seen two miles east of the town of Aversa, near\r\nthe villages of San Arpino and San Elpidio.\r\n\r\n[1344] The people of Affilæ, an ancient Hernican town. It is still\r\ncalled Affile, and has many ancient remains.\r\n\r\n[1345] The people of Arpinum, once a famous city of the Volscians. The\r\npresent Arpino occupies its site; there are few Roman remains, but\r\nits ancient walls, of Cyclopean construction, still exist. It was the\r\nbirth-place of Marius and Cicero. The villa of the latter was on the\r\nbanks of the adjoining river Fibrenus. It was, and is still, famous for\r\nits woollen manufactures.\r\n\r\n[1346] The people of Auximum, a city of Picenum. Its site is occupied\r\nby the modern Osimo; there are numerous remains of antiquity to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1347] Or perhaps “Abellini,” people of Abelliacum; which, if meant,\r\nought not to be included in this division, being a city of the Hirpini.\r\nThis city was finally destroyed in the wars of the Greeks and Lombards,\r\nand the modern Avellino rose on its site. There are considerable\r\nruins in the vicinity. According to Hardouin, this place also claimed\r\nthe honour of giving name to filberts, which grew abundantly in\r\nits vicinity. If such is the case, it seems probable that both it\r\nand Abella took their names from that fruit as called by the early\r\ninhabitants. See Note [1335] p. 198.\r\n\r\n[1348] An ancient city of Latium. Its ruins are to be seen in the\r\nvicinity of the Via Appia. See a curious story connected with it in\r\nOvid’s Fasti, B. iii. l. 667 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[1349] There were two cities of this name on the confines of Samnium\r\nand Campania, one in the valley of the Volturnum, the modern Caiazzo,\r\nthe other in Campania, between Capua and Beneventum, whose ruins are\r\nprobably those to be seen at Le Galazzi, between Caserta and Maddaloni.\r\n\r\n[1350] Once a considerable city of Latium. The modern city of San\r\nGermano has risen on its ruins, while the name of Monte Casino has been\r\nretained by the monastery founded near it by St. Bernard A.D. 529.\r\n\r\n[1351] The present Calvi probably occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[1352] It is not named in history. Its site was probably between\r\nPalestrina and Il Piglio.\r\n\r\n[1353] The people of Cereatæ, a town of Latium. It is supposed that the\r\nancient monastery of Casamari occupied its site.\r\n\r\n[1354] The people of Cora, an ancient city of Latium. The present Cori\r\nstands on its site, and there are considerable remains of the ancient\r\nwalls and other buildings.\r\n\r\n[1355] The people of Castrimœnium, a colony of Sylla. It has been\r\nsuggested that these were the same people whom Pliny speaks of at a\r\nsubsequent place in this chapter as the Munienses, an extinct people\r\nof Latium. If so, the name was perhaps changed on the establishment\r\nhere by Sylla of his colony. It probably stood near the modern city of\r\nMarino.\r\n\r\n[1356] The people of Cingulum, a city of Picenum, the site of which is\r\noccupied by the modern Cingoli.\r\n\r\n[1357] It is conjectured that Fabia was on the same site as the present\r\nvillage of Rocca di Papa.\r\n\r\n[1358] The inhabitants of Forum Popilii in Campania; its site is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n[1359] The people of Frusino, originally a Volscian city. The modern\r\nFrosinone occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[1360] The people of Ferentinum, a city of the Hernici: the present\r\ncity of Ferentino stands on its site. The ruins are very extensive.\r\n\r\n[1361] Probably the people of Fregellæ, an ancient city of the\r\nVolscians. Its site is now unknown, but it was probably on the banks of\r\nthe Liris, opposite to the modern Ceprano.\r\n\r\n[1362] The people of Fabrateria or Frabateria, a Volscian city. A Roman\r\ncolony was placed there B.C. 124, by C. Gracchus, and probably the old\r\ninhabitants for that reason styled themselves “Veteres.” The ruins at\r\nSan Giovanni in Cerico, about three miles from Falvaterra, are supposed\r\nto be those of this place, or at least of the new town or colony. In\r\nsuch case Falvaterra may occupy the site of the original city.\r\n\r\n[1363] The people of Ficulnea or Ficulia, a city of ancient Latium, on\r\nthe Via Nomentana. It is supposed to have decayed soon after the reign\r\nof M. Aurelius. Its site was probably on the modern domain of Cesarini,\r\nthough some separate the ancient Latin city from the Roman town, and\r\nfix the locality of the former on the hill called Monte Gentile, or\r\nthat of the Torre Lupara.\r\n\r\n[1364] These are omitted in most editions, but if a correct reading,\r\nthe word must signify the “people of Fregellæ,” and the Freginates\r\nmust be the people of Fregenæ in Etruria; although they do not appear\r\nproperly to belong to this locality.\r\n\r\n[1365] “The Market of Appius.” It was distant forty-three miles from\r\nRome, and we learn from Horace, that it was the usual resting-place\r\nfor travellers at the end of one day’s journey from Rome. It is also\r\nmentioned in the account of the journey of St. Paul (Acts xxviii. 15)\r\nas one of the usual resting-places on the Appian way. There are now no\r\ninhabitants on the spot, but considerable ruins still exist, as well as\r\nthe forty-third milestone, which is still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1366] Probably the inhabitants of Ferentium or Ferentinum, now\r\nFerento, five miles from Viterbo, a city of Etruria, of which very\r\nconsiderable remains exist.\r\n\r\n[1367] The people of Gabii, formerly one of the most famous cities of\r\nLatium. On its site the ruins of a mediæval fortress now stand, known\r\nas Castiglione. Some remains of the walls still exist.\r\n\r\n[1368] The people of Interamna Lirinas, a Roman colony on the banks\r\nof the Liris; and as there were several cities of the same name, it\r\nwas generally distinguished by the epithet “Lirinas.” Pliny no doubt\r\ncalls it “Succasina,” from its vicinity to Casinum. Its site, though\r\nuninhabited, is still called Terame, and there are numerous remains of\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\n[1369] Probably the people of Lavinium were thus called from their\r\nsupposed Trojan descent. The town was said to have been founded by\r\nÆneas in honour of his wife Lavinia, the daughter of Latinus. In the\r\ntimes of the Antonines it was united with Laurentum; their ruins are to\r\nbe seen at Casale di Copocotta.\r\n\r\n[1370] The people of Norba, a town of Latium. It is now called Norma,\r\nand there are still some remains of the ancient walls.\r\n\r\n[1371] Nomentum, now called La Mentana, was a Latin town, fourteen\r\nmiles from Rome.\r\n\r\n[1372] The people of Præneste, one of the most ancient towns of Latium.\r\nIt was originally a Pelasgic city, but claimed a Greek origin, and was\r\nsaid to have been built by Telegonus, the son of Ulysses. During summer\r\nit was much frequented by the Romans for its delightful coolness. The\r\nremains of its ancient walls are still to be seen at Palestrina.\r\n\r\n[1373] The people of Privernum, now Piperno, an ancient city of Latium.\r\n\r\n[1374] The people of Setia, now Sesse or Sezza, an ancient town of\r\nLatium, to the east of the Pomptine marshes. It was famous for its wine.\r\n\r\n[1375] The people of Signia, now Segni, a town of Latium founded by\r\nTarquinius Priscus. There are still some remains of its walls.\r\n\r\n[1376] The people of Suessula, now Castel di Sessola.\r\n\r\n[1377] The people of Telesia, a town of Samnium seven leagues from\r\nCapua, now called Telese.\r\n\r\n[1378] Trebula was distinguished probably by this surname from a town\r\nof that name in Samnium. There seem to have been two places of the name\r\nin the Sabine territory, but it is not known which is here meant. The\r\nruins of one of them are supposed to be those not far from Maddaloni.\r\n\r\n[1379] The people of Treba, now Trevi, a town of Latium.\r\n\r\n[1380] The people of Tusculum, an ancient town of Latium, the ruins of\r\nwhich are to be seen on a hill about two miles distant from the modern\r\nFrascati. Cicero’s favourite residence was his Tusculan villa, and Cato\r\nthe censor was a native of this place.\r\n\r\n[1381] The people of Verulæ, a town of the Hernici, in Latium, now\r\nVeroli.\r\n\r\n[1382] The people of Velitræ, an ancient town of the Volsci, now\r\nVelletri. It was the birth-place of the emperor Augustus.\r\n\r\n[1383] The people of Ulubræ, a small town of Latium, near the Pomptine\r\nMarshes; its site is unknown.\r\n\r\n[1384] The people of Urbinum; there were two places of that name in\r\nUmbria, now called Urbeno and Urbania.\r\n\r\n[1385] The name probably by which the city was called in the mystical\r\nlanguage of the priesthood. It has been said that this mysterious name\r\nof Rome was Valentia; if so, it appears to be only a translation of her\r\nname Græcized—Ῥώμη, “strength.” This subject will be found again\r\nmentioned in B. xxviii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1386] Solinus says that he was put to death as a punishment for his\r\nrashness. M. Sichel has suggested that this mysterious name was no\r\nother than Angerona.\r\n\r\n[1387] It is not known whether this mystical divinity was the goddess\r\nof anguish and fear, or of silence, or whether she was the guardian\r\ndeity of Rome. Julius Modestus says that she relieved men and cattle\r\nwhen visited by the disease called “angina,” or “quinsy,” whence her\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[1388] The Carmental, the Roman, and the Pandanian or Saturnian gates,\r\naccording to Varro.\r\n\r\n[1389] Titus was saluted Imperator after the siege of Jerusalem, and\r\nwas associated with his father Vespasian in the government. They also\r\nacted together as Censors.\r\n\r\n[1390] The Lares Compitales presided over the divisions of the city,\r\nwhich were marked by the _compita_ or points where two or more streets\r\ncrossed each other, and where ‘ædiculæ’ or small chapels were erected\r\nin their honour. Statues of these little divinities were erected at\r\nthe corner of every street. It was probably this custom which first\r\nsuggested the idea of setting up images of the Virgin and Saints at\r\nthe corners of the streets, which are still to be seen in many Roman\r\nCatholic countries at the present day.\r\n\r\n[1391] This was a gilded column erected by Augustus in the Forum, and\r\ncalled “milliarium aureum;” on it were inscribed the distances of the\r\nprincipal points to which the “viæ” or high-roads conducted.\r\n\r\n[1392] Supposing the circuit of the city to have been as he says,\r\n13-2/5 miles, he must either make a great miscalculation here, or the\r\ntext must be very corrupt. The average diameter of the city would be\r\nin such case about 4-1/2 miles, the average length of each radius\r\ndrawn from the mile-column 2-1/4 miles, and the total amount 83-1/4\r\nmiles, whereas he makes it but 20-3/4 miles, or little better than an\r\naverage of half-a-mile for each radius. We may also remark that the\r\ncamp of the Prætorian cohorts here mentioned was established by the\r\nemperor Tiberius, by the advice of Sejanus. Ajasson’s translation makes\r\nthe measurement to be made to _twelve_ gates only, but the text as it\r\nstands will not admit of such a construction.\r\n\r\n[1393] The Aventine, Cælian, and Quirinal hills.\r\n\r\n[1394] Such as Ocriculum, Tibur, Aricia, &c.\r\n\r\n[1395] Near Antium. Casale di Conca stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1396] Suæssa Pometia. It was destroyed by the consul Servilius, and\r\nits site was said, with that of twenty-two other towns, to have been\r\ncovered by the Pomptine Marsh, to which it gave its name.\r\n\r\n[1397] A town of Latium destroyed by Ancus Martius.\r\n\r\n[1398] An ancient city of Latium, conquered by Romulus; on which\r\noccasion he slew its king Acron and gained the _spolia opima_. Nibby\r\nsuggests that it stood on the Magugliano, two miles south-east of Monte\r\nGentile. Holstein says that it stood where the present Sant’ Angelo or\r\nMonticelli stands.\r\n\r\n[1399] Also destroyed by Ancus Martius. A farm called Dragonello,\r\neleven miles from Rome, is supposed to have stood upon its site.\r\nTellene was also destroyed by the same king. Tifata was a town of\r\nCampania.\r\n\r\n[1400] A city of Latium, which was conquered by Tarquinius Priscus. It\r\nhas been suggested that its ruins are visible about a mile to the north\r\nof Monte Sant’ Angelo.\r\n\r\n[1401] A Sabine town, the people of which were incorporated by\r\nTarquinius Priscus with the Roman citizens. It is supposed to have\r\nstood on the present Monte Sant’ Angelo.\r\n\r\n[1402] An ancient city of Latium, subdued by Tarquinius Priscus, on\r\nwhich occasion Ocrisia, the mother of Servius Tullius, fell into the\r\nhands of the Romans as a captive. It was probably situate on one of the\r\nisolated hills that rise from the plain of the Campagna.\r\n\r\n[1403] Both Virgil and Ovid allude to this tradition.\r\n\r\n[1404] Said to have been so called from being “opposite” to the ancient\r\ncity of Saturnia. The Janiculus or Janiculum was a fortress on the\r\nopposite bank of the Tiber, and a suburb of Rome, connected with it by\r\nthe Sublician bridge.\r\n\r\n[1405] A very ancient city situate three miles from Rome, and said\r\nto have been so called from its position on the Tiber, _ante amnem_.\r\nIn the time of Strabo it had become a mere village. It stood at the\r\nconfluence of the Anio and the Tiber.\r\n\r\n[1406] An ancient city of Latium reduced by Tarquinius Priscus. It\r\nhas been suggested that the town of Palombara, near the foot of Monte\r\nGennaro, stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1407] An ancient city of Latium. It probably gradually fell into\r\ndecay. Lucius Tarquinius, the husband of Lucretia, is represented as\r\ndwelling here during the siege of Ardea. Its site is thought by some\r\nto have been at Castellaccio or Castel dell’ Osa, and by others at\r\nLunghezza, which is perhaps the most probable conjecture.\r\n\r\n[1408] An ancient city of the Sabines. Its ruins are visible at San\r\nVittorino, a village near Aquila.\r\n\r\n[1409] An ancient town of the Volsci, five leagues from Velletri.\r\nSermonata now stands on its site. It must not be confounded with the\r\ntown of the Peligni, the birth-place of Ovid.\r\n\r\n[1410] “Populi Albenses.” It does not appear to be exactly known what\r\nis the force of this expression, but he probably means either colonies\r\nfrom Alba, or else nations who joined in the confederacy of which Alba\r\nwas the principal. Niebuhr looks upon them as mere demi or boroughs of\r\nthe territory of Alba.\r\n\r\n[1411] “Accipere carnem.” Literally, “to take the flesh.” It appears\r\nthat certain nations, of which Alba was the chief, were in early times\r\naccustomed to meet on the Alban Mount for the purposes of sacrifice.\r\nThe subject is full of obscurity, but it has been suggested that this\r\nminor confederacy co-existed with a larger one including all the Latin\r\ncities, and there can be little doubt that the common sacrifice was\r\ntypical of a bond of union among the states that partook therein.\r\nIt does not necessarily appear from the context that more than the\r\nthirty-one states _after_ mentioned took part therein, though the text\r\nmay be so construed as to imply that the Latin nations previously\r\nmentioned also shared in the sacrifice; if so, it would seem to imply\r\nthat Alba was the chief city of the _whole_ Latin confederacy. See this\r\nsubject ably discussed in Dr. Smith’s Dictionary of Ancient Geography,\r\nunder the article _Latini_.\r\n\r\n[1412] The people of Æsulæ. Of this Latin city nothing is known. The\r\nterritory is mentioned by Horace, and Gell places its site on the Monte\r\nAffiliano.\r\n\r\n[1413] The people of Bubentum. Nothing is known of this Latin city or\r\nof the preceding ones.\r\n\r\n[1414] Bola was an ancient city of Latium, taken successively by\r\nCoriolanus and M. Postumius. Its site is supposed to have been five\r\nmiles from the modern Palestrina, at the modern village of Lugnano.\r\n\r\n[1415] The people of Corioli. It was probably a Latian town, but fell\r\ninto the possession of the Volsci, from whom it was taken by Cn.\r\nMarcius, who thence obtained the name of “Coriolanus.” Monte Giove,\r\nnineteen miles from Rome, has been suggested as its site.\r\n\r\n[1416] Pliny is supposed to be in error in representing Fidenæ, the\r\nearly antagonist of Rome, as being extinct in his time, and he will be\r\nfound in the sequel reckoning it in the Fourth Region. This ancient\r\nLatian town never lost its municipal rank, though it had no doubt in\r\nhis time become a mere country town. The present Castel Giubilco is\r\nsupposed to be situate on its site.\r\n\r\n[1417] The people of Horta, a town of Etruria, now Horte. Many Etruscan\r\nremains have been discovered there.\r\n\r\n[1418] The people of Longula, a Volscian town. Buon Riposo now occupies\r\nits site.\r\n\r\n[1419] The people of Pedum; nothing is known of it. The rest of these\r\nnations are either almost or entirely unknown.\r\n\r\n[1420] This was an ancient town between Pompeii and Surrentum. After\r\nits overthrow, as mentioned by Pliny, it was in some measure rebuilt,\r\npossibly after this passage was penned. It was finally destroyed by the\r\ngreat eruption of Vesuvius in the year A.D. 79, and it was here that\r\nour author breathed his last.\r\n\r\n[1421] A town three miles west of Capua. It was of much importance as a\r\nmilitary position, and played a considerable part in the second Punic\r\nwar. The period of its final destruction is unknown; but modern Capua\r\nis built on its site.\r\n\r\n[1422] This city took the lead in the war of the Latin cities against\r\nTarquinius Priscus. Gell and Nibby think that it was situate about\r\neleven miles from Rome, a mile to the south of the Appian way, where\r\nthere are some remains that indicate the site of an ancient city, near\r\nthe stream called the Fosso delle Fratocche. Livy tells us that with\r\nthe spoils thence derived, Tarquinius celebrated the _Ludi Magni_ for\r\nthe first time.\r\n\r\n[1423] Opposite Capreæ, and situate on the Promontory of Minerva.\r\nSorrento now stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1424] The modern Silaro; it was the boundary between Lucania and\r\nCampania, and rises in the Apennines.\r\n\r\n[1425] A town in the south of Campania, at the head of the Gulf of\r\nPæstum. In consequence of the aid which they gave to Hannibal, the\r\ninhabitants were forced to abandon their town and live in the adjoining\r\nvillages. The name of Picentini was given, as here stated, to the\r\ninhabitants of all the territory between the Promontory of Minerva and\r\nthe river Silarus. They were a portion of the Sabine Picentes, who\r\nwere transplanted thither after the conquest of Picenum, B.C. 268. The\r\nmodern Vicenza stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1426] The Argonaut. Probably this was only a vague tradition.\r\n\r\n[1427] By using the genitive ‘Salerni,’ he would seem to imply that\r\nthe Roman colony of Salernum then gave name to the district of which\r\nPicentia was the chief town. Ajasson however has translated it merely\r\n“Salernum and Picentia.” ‘Intus’ can hardly mean “inland,” as Picentia\r\nwas near the coast, and so was Salernum.\r\n\r\n[1428] This was an ancient town of Campania, at the innermost corner of\r\nthe Gulf of Pæstum, situate near the coast, on a height at the foot of\r\nwhich lay its harbour. It attained great prosperity, as Salerno, in the\r\nmiddle ages, and was noted for its School of Health established there;\r\nwhich issued periodically rules for the preservation of health in Latin\r\nLeonine verse.\r\n\r\n[1429] “Græciæ maxime populi.” This may also be rendered “a people who\r\nmostly emigrated from Greece,” in reference to the Siculi or Sicilians,\r\nbut the other is probably the correct translation.\r\n\r\n[1430] A town of Lucania, colonized by the Sybarites about B.C. 524. In\r\nthe time of Augustus it seems to have been principally famous for the\r\nexquisite beauty of its roses. Its ruins are extremely magnificent.\r\n\r\n[1431] Now the Golfo di Salerno.\r\n\r\n[1432] A Greek town founded by the Phocæans. It was the birth-place\r\nof the philosophers Parmenides and Zeno, who founded a school of\r\nphilosophy known as the Eleatic. Castell’ a Mare della Brucca stands on\r\nits site.\r\n\r\n[1433] Now Capo di Palinuro; said to have received its name from\r\nPalinurus, the pilot of Æneas, who fell into the sea there and was\r\nmurdered by the natives. See Virgil, Æneid, B. vi. l. 381 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[1434] Now the Golfo di Policastro.\r\n\r\n[1435] This tower or column was erected in the vicinity of Rhegium on\r\nthe Straits of Sicily. It was 100 stadia, or about eight miles, from\r\nthe town, and at it passengers usually embarked for Sicily. The spot is\r\nnow called Torre di Carallo.\r\n\r\n[1436] Now the Faraone.\r\n\r\n[1437] A Greek colony. The present Policastro occupies very nearly its\r\nsite. It seems to have received its name from the cultivation of box\r\ntrees in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[1438] Or more properly Laos, originally a Greek colony. In the\r\nvicinity is the modern town of Laino, and the river is called the Lao.\r\n\r\n[1439] Ptolemy mentions it as an inland town, and Livy speaks of it\r\nas a Lucanian city. It probably stood near the modern Maratea, twelve\r\nmiles south-east of Policastro.\r\n\r\n[1440] The modern Bato.\r\n\r\n[1441] The bay of Bivona, formerly Vibo, the Italian name for the Greek\r\ncity of Hippo or Hippona. On its site stands the modern Bivona.\r\n\r\n[1442] “Locus Clampetiæ.” Clampetia or Lampetia stood in the vicinity\r\nof the modern Amantia. From other authors we find that it was still\r\nexisting at this time. If such is the fact, the meaning will be “the\r\nplace where the former _municipal town_ of Clampetia stood,” it being\r\nsupposed to have lost in its latter years its municipal privileges.\r\n\r\n[1443] One of the ancient Ausonian towns, and afterwards colonized by\r\nthe Ætolians. Like its namesake in Cyprus it was famous for its copper.\r\nIts site is now occupied by Torre di Lupi.\r\n\r\n[1444] A Greek city, almost totally destroyed by Hannibal; Santa\r\nEufemia occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[1445] One of the cities of the Bruttii; now Cosenza.\r\n\r\n[1446] The part which now constitutes the Farther Calabria.\r\n\r\n[1447] Supposed to be the same as the Arconte, which falls into the\r\nCrathis near Consentia. Nothing is known of the town here alluded to,\r\nbut it must not be confounded with Acherontia, the modern Acerenza, in\r\nApulia, which was a different place.\r\n\r\n[1448] Supposed to have been the same as the modern port of Tropea.\r\n\r\n[1449] The modern Marro.\r\n\r\n[1450] Its ruins are supposed to be those seen near Palmi.\r\n\r\n[1451] Probably the modern Melia stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1452] A town on the promontory of the same name, now called Scilla or\r\nSciglio, where the monster Scylla was fabled to have dwelt.\r\n\r\n[1453] Homer says (Odyssey, xii. 124), that it had its name from the\r\nnymph Cratæis, the mother of Scylla. It is probably the small stream\r\nnow called Fiume di Solano or dei Pesci.\r\n\r\n[1454] The modern Capo di Cavallo, according to the older commentators;\r\nbut more recent geographers think that the Punta del Pezzo was the\r\npoint so called.\r\n\r\n[1455] Now called Capo di Faro, from the lighthouse there erected.\r\n\r\n[1456] Originally a Greek colony; a Roman colony was settled there by\r\nAugustus. The modern city of Reggio occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[1457] it extended south of Consentia to the Sicilian Straits, a\r\ndistance of 700 stadia. It produced the pitch for which Bruttium was so\r\ncelebrated. Its site still has the name of Sila.\r\n\r\n[1458] Or White Rock, now Capo dell’ Armi. It forms the extremity of\r\nthe Apennine Chain.\r\n\r\n[1459] The site of the city of Locri is supposed to have been that of\r\nthe present Motta di Burzano.\r\n\r\n[1460] He says that they were called Epizephyrii, from the promontory\r\nof Zephyrium, now the Capo di Burzano; but according to others, they\r\nhad this name only because their colony lay _to the west_ of their\r\nnative Greece. Strabo says that it was founded by the Locri Ozolæ, and\r\nnot the Opuntii, as most authors have stated.\r\n\r\n[1461] This expression is explained by a reference to the end of the\r\nFirst Chapter of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[1462] Called by some the Canal de Baleares.\r\n\r\n[1463] Or Southern Sea.\r\n\r\n[1464] The modern Iviza and Formentera.\r\n\r\n[1465] The Greek for which is πίτυς.\r\n\r\n[1466] Less than two leagues in width.\r\n\r\n[1467] The real distance is 34 miles from the northern point of\r\nIviza, called Punta de Serra, to the southern point of Formentera,\r\nnamely—across Iviza 22 miles, across the sea 5, and across Formentera 7.\r\n\r\n[1468] Now Denia.\r\n\r\n[1469] This is not correct: the distance is but 45 miles.\r\n\r\n[1470] This is incorrect: taken at the very greatest, the distance is\r\nonly 522 stadia, eight to the mile.\r\n\r\n[1471] The Xucar in Spain.\r\n\r\n[1472] We more generally find it stated that the isle of Formentera,\r\none of the Pityussæ, was called Colubraria. He probably refers to the\r\nislands of the group about twenty leagues from the coast of Spain, now\r\nknown by the name of Columbrete; but they are not near the Xucar, from\r\nwhich, as well as from the Pityussæ, they are distant about seventy\r\nmiles. The latter islands are now generally considered as part of the\r\ngroup of the Baleares.\r\n\r\n[1473] Now Majorca and Minorca, with the ancient Pityussæ.\r\n\r\n[1474] They served as mercenaries, first under the Carthaginians and\r\nafterwards under the Romans. The ancient writers generally derive the\r\nname of the people from their skill as archers—βαλεαρεῖς, from βάλλω,\r\n“to throw”; but Strabo assigns to the name a Phœnician origin, as\r\nbeing equivalent to the Greek γυμνῆται, “light-armed soldiers.” It is\r\nprobably from their light equipment that the Greeks gave to the islands\r\nthe name of Γυμνησίαι. Livy says that they used to go naked during the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n[1475] Seventy miles is the real length of Majorca, and the\r\ncircumference is barely 250 miles.\r\n\r\n[1476] Still called Palma. This and Pollentia were Roman colonies\r\nsettled by Metellus.\r\n\r\n[1477] Now Pollenza.\r\n\r\n[1478] Now Sineu on the Borga.\r\n\r\n[1479] The circumference is about 110 miles, the length 32.\r\n\r\n[1480] Now Ciudadela.\r\n\r\n[1481] Now Port Mahon. The site of Sanisera, which was probably more\r\ninland, is unknown.\r\n\r\n[1482] Now Cabrera. The distance is not twelve, but nine miles.\r\n\r\n[1483] Now called the Malgrates.\r\n\r\n[1484] Now Dragonera.\r\n\r\n[1485] Now El Torre.\r\n\r\n[1486] As already mentioned he seems to confound Formentera, which was\r\ncalled Ophiusa, with the present group of Columbrete, which islands\r\nwere probably called Colubraria.\r\n\r\n[1487] The former editions mostly omit “nec”; and so make it that\r\nEbusus _does_ produce the rabbits. Certainly, it does seem more likely\r\nthat he would mention that fact than the absence of it, which even to\r\nPliny could not appear very remarkable.\r\n\r\n[1488] D’Anville thinks that this is Metapina, but D’Astruc thinks that\r\nthe flat islands, called Les Tignes, are meant.\r\n\r\n[1489] Now called Brescon, near Agde, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[1490] Who were of Greek origin, and so called them, because they stood\r\nin a row, στοῖχος.\r\n\r\n[1491] Now called Porqueroles. Prote signifies the first, Mese the\r\nmiddle one, and Hypæa the one below the others.\r\n\r\n[1492] Now Port Croz. D’Anville considers that Pliny is mistaken\r\nin identifying this island with Pomponiana or Pompeiana, which he\r\nconsiders to be the same with the peninsula now called Calle de Giens,\r\nwhich lies opposite to Porqueroles.\r\n\r\n[1493] Now called the Ile du Levant or du Titan. The group is called\r\nthe Islands of Hières or Calypso.\r\n\r\n[1494] These are probably the little islands now known as Ratoneau,\r\nPomègue, and If. It has however been suggested that these names belong\r\nto the islands of Hières already mentioned in the text, and that\r\nSturium is the present Porquerolles, Phœnice Port-Croz, and Phila,\r\nLevant or Titan.\r\n\r\n[1495] Now Antibes, or Antiboul in the Provençal idiom.\r\n\r\n[1496] Now Saint Honorat de Lérins. The island of Lero is the present\r\nSainte Marguerite de Lérins, and is nearer to Antibes than Lerina.\r\nThe Lerinian monastery was much resorted to in the early ages of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\n[1497] In ancient Etruria, now Torre di Vada. The distance is, in\r\nreality, about ninety miles.\r\n\r\n[1498] Mariana was situate in the northern part of the island, and\r\nthe ruins of Aleria are still to be seen on the banks of the river\r\nTavignano, near the coast.\r\n\r\n[1499] Probably near the present Monte Cristo.\r\n\r\n[1500] He probably means the _group_ of islands called Formicole, which\r\nare situate only thirty-three miles from Corsica, and not near sixty.\r\n\r\n[1501] Now La Gorgona.\r\n\r\n[1502] Both of these names meaning “Goat island.” It is now called\r\nCapraia.\r\n\r\n[1503] The modern Giglio.\r\n\r\n[1504] Now Gianuto, opposite Monte Argentaro on the main-land.\r\n\r\n[1505] These are probably the small islands now called Formiete or\r\nFormicole di Grossetto, Troja, Palmajola, and Cervoli.\r\n\r\n[1506] The modern Elba.\r\n\r\n[1507] Now Pianosa.\r\n\r\n[1508] Astura still retains its ancient name, Palmaria is the present\r\nPalmarola, Sinonia is now Senone, and Pontiæ is the modern Isola di\r\nPonza.\r\n\r\n[1509] Now Ventotiene.\r\n\r\n[1510] Deriving its name from the Greek word προχυτὸς, meaning “poured\r\nforth.”\r\n\r\n[1511] The present island of Ischia, off the coasts of Campania. The\r\nname of Pithecusæ appears to have been given by the Greeks to the two\r\nislands of Ænaria and Prochyta collectively.\r\n\r\n[1512] Ovid, like many other writers, mentions Inarime as though a\r\ndifferent island from Pithecusæ. See Met. B. xiv. l. 89. As is here\r\nmentioned by Pliny, many persons derived the name “Pithecusæ” from\r\nπίθηκος “an ape,” and, according to Strabo, “Aremus” was the Etrurian\r\nname for an ape. Ovid, in the Metamorphoses, _loc. cit._, confirms this\r\ntradition by relating the change of the natives into apes. The solution\r\nof its name given by Pliny appears however extremely probable, that it\r\ngained its name from its manufacture of πιθηκὰ, or earthen vessels.\r\nVirgil is supposed to have coined the name of “Inarime.”\r\n\r\n[1513] Now Posilippo. It is said to have derived its name from the\r\nGreek παυσίλυπον, as tending to drive away care by the beauty of its\r\nsituation. Virgil was buried in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[1514] The modern Castel del’ Ovo.\r\n\r\n[1515] Now Capri. Here Tiberius established his den of lustfulness\r\nand iniquity. He erected twelve villas in the island, the remains of\r\nseveral of which are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1516] The distance between is hardly five miles.\r\n\r\n[1517] These rocks appear at the present day to be nameless. The old\r\nname seems to mean, the “Rabbit Warrens.”\r\n\r\n[1518] Phintonis, according to Hardouin, is the modern Isola di Figo,\r\naccording to Mannert, Caprera. Cluver makes Fossæ to be the present\r\nIsola Rossa, while Mannert considers it to be the same with Santa\r\nMaddalena.\r\n\r\n[1519] Ταφρὸς being the Greek for the Latin word “fossa,” the ordinary\r\nmeaning of which is an “excavation.”\r\n\r\n[1520] Probably the Cape of Carbonara, from which however Africa is\r\ndistant only 121 miles, and the gulf of Gades or Cadiz 980.\r\n\r\n[1521] Now Capo Falcone.\r\n\r\n[1522] Now Asinara or Zavara, and Isola Piana.\r\n\r\n[1523] Now called Santo Antiocho, off La Punta dell’ Ulga.\r\n\r\n[1524] According to Cluver, the modern Coltelalzo.\r\n\r\n[1525] The “Baths of Juno.” The identity of these islands does not\r\nappear to have been ascertained.\r\n\r\n[1526] Said by Pausanias to have been descended from persons who\r\nescaped on the fall of Troy under the command of Iolaüs.\r\n\r\n[1527] Of the town of Sulcis. Its ruins are probably those seen at the\r\nvillage of Sulci, near the port Palma di Solo.\r\n\r\n[1528] Their town was probably on the site of the present Iglesias.\r\n\r\n[1529] Their town was probably either the present Napoli or Acqua di\r\nCorsari.\r\n\r\n[1530] Their town is probably indicated by the ruins on the river\r\nGavino.\r\n\r\n[1531] Their town was Caralis, the present Cagliari.\r\n\r\n[1532] Their town was probably Nora, the present Torre Forcadizo.\r\n\r\n[1533] “At Libyso’s Tower.”\r\n\r\n[1534] From the Greek ἴχνος, “a footstep.”\r\n\r\n[1535] Now La Licosa, a small rocky island.\r\n\r\n[1536] Now Torricella, Praca, and Brace, with other rocks.\r\n\r\n[1537] Posidonius, quoted by Strabo, says 550.\r\n\r\n[1538] Meaning that it comes from the Greek verb ῥηγνύμι, “to break.”\r\nThis is probably only a fanciful origin of the name.\r\n\r\n[1539] The present Garofalo. At the present day small boats approach it\r\nwithout danger.\r\n\r\n[1540] In Chap. x. Pelorus is the modern Capo di Faro.\r\n\r\n[1541] Now Capo di Passaro.\r\n\r\n[1542] The present Capo di Boco Marsala.\r\n\r\n[1543] Now Cape Bon. The real distance is but seventy-eight miles.\r\n\r\n[1544] The following are more probably the correct distances: 150, 210,\r\nand 230 miles.\r\n\r\n[1545] Now Messina.\r\n\r\n[1546] The modern Capo di Santo Alessio.\r\n\r\n[1547] Now called Taormini; the remains of the ancient town are very\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\n[1548] Probably the present Alcantara.\r\n\r\n[1549] The present Madonia and Monte di Mele.\r\n\r\n[1550] Now called I Fariglioni.\r\n\r\n[1551] In modern times called “Lognina Statione,” according to Hardouin.\r\n\r\n[1552] The modern city of Catania stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1553] The Fiume di Santo Leonardo, according to Hardouin, but Mannert\r\nsays the river Lentini. Ansart suggests the Guarna Lunga.\r\n\r\n[1554] Now Lentini. The ruins of Megaris are still to be seen,\r\naccording to Mannert.\r\n\r\n[1555] Now the Porcaro.\r\n\r\n[1556] The modern city of Siracosa.\r\n\r\n[1557] See B. xxxi. c. 30, for particulars of this fountain.\r\n\r\n[1558] According to Mirabella, these springs are in modern times called\r\nFonte di Canali, Cefalino, Fontana della Maddalena, Fonte Ciane, and\r\nLampismotta.\r\n\r\n[1559] The modern Fonte Bianche. The Elorus, according to Hardouin, is\r\nthe modern Acellaro, according to Mannert, the Abisso.\r\n\r\n[1560] The southern side.\r\n\r\n[1561] Now the Maulo, or Fiume di Ragusa.\r\n\r\n[1562] Still called Camarina. Scarcely any vestiges of the ancient city\r\nnow remain.\r\n\r\n[1563] According to Hardouin the Fiume Salso; but according to\r\nD’Anville and Mannert, the Fiume Ghiozzo.\r\n\r\n[1564] Now Girgenti. Gigantic remains of the ancient city are still to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\n[1565] See note [1572] in this page.\r\n\r\n[1566] The Achates is the modern Belice, the Mazara retains its name,\r\nand the Hypsa is now the Marsala.\r\n\r\n[1567] So called by the Greeks from its abundant growth of parsley,\r\ncalled by them σέλινον. Its remains are still to be seen at the spot\r\ncalled Selenti.\r\n\r\n[1568] Now Trapani. Some vestiges of its ancient mole are to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1569] The present Monte San Juliano.\r\n\r\n[1570] The great city of Palermo stands on its site. It was founded by\r\nthe Phœnicians.\r\n\r\n[1571] The modern Solunto.\r\n\r\n[1572] Himera was destroyed by the Carthaginians, B.C. 408, upon which\r\nits inhabitants founded Thermæ, so called from its hot springs. This\r\nwas probably the colony of Thermæ mentioned above by Pliny, though\r\nwrongly placed by him on the southern coast between Selinus and\r\nAgrigentum. The modern town of Termini stands on the site of Thermæ;\r\nremains of its baths and aqueduct are still to be seen. Himera stood\r\non a river of the same name, most probably the present Fiume Grande,\r\nand Fazello is of opinion that the town was situate on the site now\r\noccupied by the Torre di Bonfornello. Himera was the birth-place of the\r\npoet Stesichorus.\r\n\r\n[1573] Or Cæphalœdium. Some remains of it are to be seen at the spot\r\ncalled Cefalu.\r\n\r\n[1574] Probably on the site now occupied by the town of San Marco.\r\nFazello and Cluver however place Aluntium near San Filadelfo, where\r\nsome ruins were formerly visible, and regard San Marco as the site of\r\nAgathyrna or Agathyrnum.\r\n\r\n[1575] Probably situate near the church of Santa Maria at Tindari, now\r\nthe Capo di Mongioio.\r\n\r\n[1576] Now called Melazzo.\r\n\r\n[1577] Their city was Centuripa, on a hill S.W. of Ætna. The modern\r\nCentorbi occupies its site, and some of its ruins may still be seen.\r\n\r\n[1578] Netum probably stood on the spot now known as Noto Anticho.\r\n\r\n[1579] The ruins of Segesta are supposed to be those near the river San\r\nBartolomeo, twelve miles south of Alcamo.\r\n\r\n[1580] Asaro occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[1581] A people dwelling at the foot of Mount Ætna, according to\r\nD’Anville, at a place now called Nicolosi.\r\n\r\n[1582] The people of Agyrium; the site of which is now called San\r\nFilippo d’Argiro. Diodorus Siculus was a native of this place.\r\n\r\n[1583] Acræ occupied a bleak hill in the vicinity of the modern\r\nPallazolo, where its ruins are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1584] Their town was Bidis near Syracuse. The modern Bibino or San\r\nGiovanni di Bidini is supposed to stand on its site.\r\n\r\n[1585] The people of Cetaria, between Panormus and Drepanum. Its site\r\nis unknown.\r\n\r\n[1586] The people of Cacyrum, supposed to have stood on the site of\r\nthe modern Cassaro. The Drepanitani were so called from living on the\r\npromontory of Drepanum.\r\n\r\n[1587] The ruins near La Cittadella are probably those of Ergetium.\r\n\r\n[1588] The people of Echetla. According to Faziello and Cluver its\r\nruins were those to be seen at the place called Occhiala or Occhula,\r\ntwo miles from the town of Gran Michele.\r\n\r\n[1589] The inhabitants of the city of Eryx, on the mountain of that\r\nname, now San Giuliano. The ancient city stood probably half-way down\r\nthe mountain.\r\n\r\n[1590] The town of Entella survived till the thirteenth century, when\r\nit was destroyed by the Emperor Frederic II. The ruins were formerly to\r\nbe seen near Poggio la Reale.\r\n\r\n[1591] Perhaps the people of Enna, once a famous city. According to\r\nthe story as related by Ovid and Claudian, it was from this spot that\r\nProserpine was carried off by Pluto. It stood on the same site as the\r\ntown of Castro Giovanni. This note may however be more applicable to\r\nthe Hennenses, mentioned below.\r\n\r\n[1592] The ruins of Enguinum are probably those in the vicinity of the\r\nmodern town of Gangi.\r\n\r\n[1593] The people of Gela, one of the most important cities of Sicily.\r\nIts site was probably the modern Terranova, near the river Fiume di\r\nTerranova.\r\n\r\n[1594] The people probably of Galata or Galaria; on the site of which\r\nthe modern village of Galata is supposed to stand.\r\n\r\n[1595] The people probably of Halesa; its ruins are supposed to be\r\nthose near the village of Tysa, near the river Pettineo.\r\n\r\n[1596] The people of Hybla. There were three cities of this name in\r\nSicily, the Greater, the Less, and Hybla Megara. The name was probably\r\nderived from the local divinity mentioned by Pausanias as being so\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n[1597] The people of Herbita; the site of which was probably at\r\nNicosia, or else at Sperlinga, two miles south of it.\r\n\r\n[1598] There were two places in Sicily known as Herbessus or\r\nErbessus—one near Agrigentum, the other about sixteen miles from\r\nSyracuse, on the site, it is supposed, of the present Pantalica.\r\n\r\n[1599] The people of Halicyæ, in the west of Sicily. The modern town of\r\nSalemi is supposed to occupy its site.\r\n\r\n[1600] The people of Adranum or Hadranum, a town famous for its temple\r\nof the Sicilian deity Adranus. Its site is occupied by the modern town\r\nof Aderno. The ruins are very considerable.\r\n\r\n[1601] The people of Ietæ; the site of which town is said by Fazello to\r\nbe the modern Iato. The sites of the places previously mentioned cannot\r\nbe identified.\r\n\r\n[1602] The site of their town is situate at the modern Mistretta, where\r\nsome ruins are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1603] The site of their town was probably the present village of\r\nMandri Bianchi on the river Dittaino.\r\n\r\n[1604] Probably the people of Motuca, mentioned by Ptolemy, now Modica.\r\n\r\n[1605] Their town probably stood on the site of the present Mineo.\r\n\r\n[1606] It has been suggested that these are the same as the people of\r\nTauromenium, said to have been a Naxian colony.\r\n\r\n[1607] They are supposed to have dwelt on the site of the present Noara.\r\n\r\n[1608] The ruins of the town of Petra are supposed to have been those\r\nto be seen near Castro Novo, according to Mannert.\r\n\r\n[1609] Fazello is of opinion that the present Colisano occupies the\r\nsite of the ancient Paropus.\r\n\r\n[1610] The city of Phthinthias was peopled by the inhabitants of Gela,\r\nby command of Phthinthias the despot of Agrigentum. Its ruins are\r\nprobably those seen in the vicinity of the modern Alicata.\r\n\r\n[1611] The people of Selinus previously mentioned in p. 218.\r\n\r\n[1612] Randazzo, at the foot of Ætna, is supposed to occupy the site of\r\nthe ancient Tissa.\r\n\r\n[1613] The people of Triocala, now Troccoli, near Calata Bellota.\r\n\r\n[1614] Zancle was the ancient Greek name of Messina, which was so\r\ncalled from its similarity in shape to a sickle. The Messenian colony\r\nof the Zanclæi probably dwelt in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[1615] Gaulos is the present Gozo, and Melita the important island of\r\nMalta. The distance here mentioned is in reality only sixty-one miles\r\nfrom Camerina.\r\n\r\n[1616] Now Pantellaria.\r\n\r\n[1617] The modern island of Maretimo.\r\n\r\n[1618] Probably the present island of Limosa.\r\n\r\n[1619] Galata still has the name of Calata, Lopadusa is the present\r\nLampedosa, and Æthusa, according to Mannert, is called Favignana.\r\n\r\n[1620] Now Levanzo.\r\n\r\n[1621] According to Mannert, this is the island Alicur, to the west of\r\nthe Æolian or Liparian islands. Ustica still retains its ancient name.\r\n\r\n[1622] The least distance between these localities is forty-five miles.\r\n\r\n[1623] There are now eleven, some of which are supposed to have risen\r\nfrom the sea since the time of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1624] From Vulcan the god of fire, the Greek Hephæstus.\r\n\r\n[1625] Now called the Great Lipara.\r\n\r\n[1626] According to Solinus, c. vi., Æolus succeeded him. Its name\r\nMelogonis was by some ascribed to its great produce of honey.\r\n\r\n[1627] The shortest distance between these localities is forty-six\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n[1628] Now called Volcano.\r\n\r\n[1629] Now Strongoli and Stromboli. It is the only one of these\r\nmountains that is continually burning. Notwithstanding the dangers of\r\ntheir locality, this island is inhabited by about fifty families.\r\n\r\n[1630] Strabo makes the same mistake; the distance is twenty miles.\r\n\r\n[1631] According to Hardouin and D’Anville this is the modern Saline,\r\nbut Mannert says Panaria. The geographers differ in assigning their\r\nancient names to the other three, except that Euonymos, from its name,\r\nthe “left-hand” island, is clearly the modern Lisca Bianca.\r\n\r\n[1632] These are the Gulf of Locri, the Gulf of Scyllacium, and the\r\nGulf of Tarentum.\r\n\r\n[1633] Now called the Sagriano, though some make it to be the modern\r\nAlaro. The site of the town of Caulon does not appear to be known: it\r\nis by some placed at Castel Vetere on the Alaro.\r\n\r\n[1634] Said by Hardouin to be the modern Monasteraci or Monte Araci.\r\n\r\n[1635] Supposed to have been situate on a hill near the modern Padula.\r\n\r\n[1636] The modern Punta di Stilo, or “Point of the Column.”\r\n\r\n[1637] The modern Gulf of Squillace.\r\n\r\n[1638] Now Squillace.\r\n\r\n[1639] Now the Gulf of Saint Eufemia.\r\n\r\n[1640] “Hannibal’s Camp.” This was the seaport of Scyllacium, and its\r\nsite was probably near the mouth of the river Corace.\r\n\r\n[1641] According to Strabo, B. vi., he intended to erect a high wall\r\nacross, and so divide it from the rest of Italy; but if we may judge,\r\nfrom the use by Pliny of the word “intercisam,” it would seem that it\r\nwas his design to cut a canal across this neck of land.\r\n\r\n[1642] According to Hardouin, the Carcines is the present river Corace,\r\nthe Crotalus the Alli, the Semirus the Simari, the Arocas the Crocchio,\r\nand the Targines the Tacina.\r\n\r\n[1643] The present Strongolo, according to D’Anville and Mannert.\r\n\r\n[1644] The present Monte Monacello and Monte Fuscaldo are supposed to\r\nform part of the range called Clibanus.\r\n\r\n[1645] Meaning that it was sacred to Castor and Pollux. Such are the\r\nchanges effected by lapse of time that these two islands are now only\r\nbleak rocks. The present locality of the other islands does not appear\r\nto be known.\r\n\r\n[1646] Now Capo di Colonne.\r\n\r\n[1647] The real distance from Acroceraunium, now Capo Linguetta, is 153\r\nmiles, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[1648] Or Crotona, one of the most famous Greek cities in the south of\r\nItaly. No ruins of the ancient city, said by Livy to have been twelve\r\nmiles in circumference, are now remaining. The modern Cotrone occupies\r\na part of its site. Pythagoras taught at this place.\r\n\r\n[1649] The modern Neto.\r\n\r\n[1650] Now called Turi, between the rivers Crati and Sibari or Roscile.\r\n\r\n[1651] A Greek town, famous for the inordinate love of luxury displayed\r\nby its inhabitants, whence a voluptuary obtained the name of a\r\n“Sybarite.” It was destroyed by the people of Crotona, who turned the\r\nwaters of the Crathis upon the town. Its site is now occupied by a\r\npestilential swamp.\r\n\r\n[1652] A famous Greek city founded on the territory of the former\r\nIonian colony of Siris. The foundations of it may still be seen, it is\r\nsupposed, near a spot called Policoro, three miles from the sea. The\r\nrivers are now called the Sinno and the Agri.\r\n\r\n[1653] The modern Salandra or Salandrella, and the Basiento.\r\n\r\n[1654] So called from its lying between the two seas. It was once a\r\ncelebrated Greek city, but was in ruins in the time of Pausanias. The\r\nplace called Torre di Mare now occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[1655] The site of Aprustum is supposed to be marked by the village of\r\nArgusto, near Chiaravalle, about five miles from the Gulf of Squillace.\r\nAtina was situate in the valley of the Tanager, now the Valle di Diano.\r\nThe ruins of Atina, which are very extensive, are to be seen near the\r\nvillage of Atena. Livy and Acron speak of Bantia as in Apulia, and not\r\nin Lucania. An ancient abbey, Santa Maria di Vanze, still marks its\r\nsite.\r\n\r\n[1656] The ruins of Eburi are supposed to be those between the modern\r\nEboli and the right bank of the Silarus. The remains of Grumentum, a\r\nplace of some importance, are still to be seen on the river Agri, half\r\na mile from the modern Saponara. Potenza occupies the site of ancient\r\nPotentia.\r\n\r\n[1657] The Sontini were probably situate on the river Sontia, now the\r\nSanza, near Policastro. The Sirini probably had their name from the\r\nriver Siris.\r\n\r\n[1658] Volcentum was situate near the Silarus, probably on the spot now\r\ncalled Bulcino or Bucino. The site of Numistro appears to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[1659] In his work “De Originibus.”\r\n\r\n[1660] Livy, B. viii., and Justin mention how that Alexander I. (in the\r\nyear B.C. 326) was obliged to engage under unfavourable circumstances\r\nnear Pandosia, on the Acheron, and fell as he was crossing the river;\r\nthus accomplishing a prophecy of Dodona which had warned him to beware\r\nof Pandosia and the Acheron. He was uncle to Alexander the Great, being\r\nthe brother of Olympias. The site of Pandosia is supposed to have been\r\nthe modern Castro Franco.\r\n\r\n[1661] This word is understood in the text, and Ansart would have it to\r\nmean that the “Gulf of Tarentum is distant,” &c., but, as he says, such\r\nan assertion would be very indefinite, it not being stated what part of\r\nthe Gulf is meant. He therefore suggests that the most distant point\r\nfrom Lacinium is meant; which however, according to him, would make but\r\n117 miles straight across, and 160 by land. The city of Tarentum would\r\nbe the most distant point.\r\n\r\n[1662] Messapus, a Bœotian, mentioned by Strabo, B. ix.\r\n\r\n[1663] A son of Lycaon.\r\n\r\n[1664] Of Lacinium and Acra Iapygia. About seventy miles seems to be\r\nthe real distance; certainly not, as Pliny says, 100.\r\n\r\n[1665] The modern Taranto to Brindisi.\r\n\r\n[1666] Probably situate at the further extremity of the bay on which\r\nTarentum stood.\r\n\r\n[1667] According to D’Anville and Mannert, the modern Oria. Messapia is\r\nthe modern Mesagna.\r\n\r\n[1668] The modern Santa Maria dell’ Alizza, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[1669] The modern Gallipoli, in the Terra di Otranto. The real distance\r\nfrom Tarentum is between fifty and sixty miles.\r\n\r\n[1670] The “Iapygian Point,” the present Capo di Santa Maria di Leuca.\r\n\r\n[1671] Its site is occupied by the little village of Vaste near\r\nPoggiordo, ten miles S.W. of Otranto. In the sixteenth century\r\nconsiderable remains of Basta were still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1672] The modern Otranto stands on its site. In the fourth century it\r\nbecame the usual place of passage from Italy to Greece, Apollonia, and\r\nDyrrhachium. Few vestiges of the ancient city are now to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1673] Anciently Apollonia, in Illyria, now called Pallina or Pollona.\r\n\r\n[1674] This was M. Terentius Varro, called “the most learned of the\r\nRomans.” His design, here mentioned, seems however to have evinced\r\nneither learning nor discretion.\r\n\r\n[1675] Now called Soleto. The ruins of the ancient city, described by\r\nGalateo as existing at Muro, are not improbably those of Fratuertium,\r\nor, perhaps more rightly, Fratuentum.\r\n\r\n[1676] The modern Lecce is supposed to occupy its site.\r\n\r\n[1677] Called Valetium by Mela. Its ruins are still to be seen near San\r\nPietro Vernotico, on the road from Brindisi to Lecce. The site is still\r\ncalled Baleso or Valesio.\r\n\r\n[1678] Ansart takes this to be the modern village of Cavallo, on\r\nthe promontory of that name; but it is more probably the modern\r\nCeglie, situate on a hill about twelve miles from the Adriatic, and\r\ntwenty-seven miles west of Brindisi. Extensive ruins still exist there.\r\nThere was another town of the same name in the south of Apulia.\r\n\r\n[1679] Now Brindisi. Virgil died here. The modern city, which is\r\nan impoverished place, presents but few vestiges of antiquity. The\r\ndistance to Dyrrhachium is in reality only about 100 miles.\r\n\r\n[1680] They occupied probably a portion of the modern Terra di Bari.\r\n\r\n[1681] Said by Hardouin to be the modern Carouigna or Carovigni; but\r\nMannert asserts it to be the same as the modern Ruvo.\r\n\r\n[1682] Or Gnatia, called by Strabo and Ptolemy a city of Apulia. It\r\nwas probably the last town of the Peucetians towards the frontiers of\r\nCalabria. Horace, in the account of his journey to Brundusium (I. Sat.\r\ni. 97-100), makes it his last halting-place, and ridicules a pretended\r\nmiracle shown by the inhabitants, who asserted that incense placed\r\non a certain altar was consumed without fire being applied. The same\r\nstory is referred to by Pliny, B. ii. c. 111, where he incorrectly\r\nmakes Egnatia a town of the Salentini. Its ruins are visible on the\r\nsea-coast, about six miles S.E. of Monopali, and an old town still\r\nbears the name of Torre d’Agnazzo.\r\n\r\n[1683] Now Bari, a considerable city. In the time of Horace it was only\r\na fishing town. It probably had a considerable intercourse with Greece,\r\nif we may judge from the remains of art found here.\r\n\r\n[1684] It is difficult to identify these rivers, from the number of\r\nsmall torrents between Brindisi and the Ofanto or Aufidus. According to\r\nMannert, the Pactius is the present Canale di Terzo.\r\n\r\n[1685] An important city of Apulia, said to have been founded by\r\nDiomedes. Horace alludes to its deficiency of water. The modern Canosa\r\nis built on probably the site of the citadel of the ancient city, the\r\nruins of which are very extensive.\r\n\r\n[1686] The ruins of this place are still to be seen at some little\r\ndistance from the coast, near the village of Salpi. The story about\r\nHannibal was very probably of Roman invention, for Justin and Frontinus\r\nspeak in praise of his continence and temperance. Appian however gives\r\nsome further particulars of this alleged amour.\r\n\r\n[1687] The present Manfredonia has arisen from the decay of this town,\r\nin consequence of the unhealthiness of the locality. Ancient Uria is\r\nsupposed to have occupied the site of Manfredonia, and the village of\r\nSanta Maria di Siponto stands where Siponti stood.\r\n\r\n[1688] Probably the Cervaro. Hardouin says the Candelaro.\r\n\r\n[1689] The present Porto Greco occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[1690] Still known as Gargano.\r\n\r\n[1691] Probably the present Varano.\r\n\r\n[1692] Now Lago di Lesina. The Frento is now called the Fortore.\r\n\r\n[1693] To distinguish it from Teanum of the Sidicini, previously\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[1694] Between the Tifernus and the Frento. Its remains are said to be\r\nstill visible at Licchiano, five miles from San Martino. The Tifernus\r\nis now called the Biferno.\r\n\r\n[1695] A people of Central Italy, occupying the tract on the east coast\r\nof the peninsula, from the Apennines to the Adriatic, and from the\r\nfrontiers of Apulia to those of the Marrucini.\r\n\r\n[1696] Strabo (B. vi.) refers to this tradition, where he mentions the\r\noracle of Calchas, the soothsayer, in Daunia in Southern Italy. Here\r\nanswers were given in dreams, for those who consulted the oracle had to\r\nsacrifice a black ram, and slept a night in the temple, lying on the\r\nskin of the victim.\r\n\r\n[1697] The modern Lucera in the Capitanata.\r\n\r\n[1698] The birth-place of Horace; now Venosa in the Basilicata.\r\n\r\n[1699] The modern Canosa stands on the site of the citadel of ancient\r\nCanusium, an Apulian city of great importance. The remains of the\r\nancient city are very considerable.\r\n\r\n[1700] So called, it was said, in remembrance of Argos, the native city\r\nof Diomedes. It was an Apulian city of considerable importance. Some\r\nslight traces of it are still to be seen at a spot which retains the\r\nname of Arpa, five miles from the city of Foggia.\r\n\r\n[1701] The names of these two defunct cities were used by the Romans\r\nto signify anything frivolous and unsubstantial; just as we speak of\r\n“castles in the air,” which the French call “châteaux en Espagne.”\r\n\r\n[1702] Livy and Ptolemy assign this place to Samnium Proper, as\r\ndistinguished from the Hirpini. It was a very ancient city of the\r\nSamnites, but in the year B.C. 268, a Roman colony was settled there,\r\non which occasion, prompted by superstitious feelings, the Romans\r\nchanged its name Maleventum, which in their language would mean “badly\r\ncome,” to Beneventum or “well come.” The modern city of Benevento\r\nstill retains numerous traces of its ancient grandeur, among others a\r\ntriumphal arch, erected A.D. 114 in honour of the emperor Trajan.\r\n\r\n[1703] The remains of Æculanum are to be seen at Le Grotte, one mile\r\nfrom Mirabella. The ruins are very extensive.\r\n\r\n[1704] There were probably two places called Aquilonia in Italy; the\r\nremains of the present one are those probably to be seen at La Cedogna.\r\nThat mentioned by Livy, B. x. c. 38-43, was probably a different place.\r\n\r\n[1705] These are supposed by some to be the people of Abellinum\r\nmentioned in the first region of Italy. Nothing however is known of\r\nthese or of the Abellinates Marsi, mentioned below.\r\n\r\n[1706] Æcæ is supposed to have been situate about nineteen miles from\r\nHerdonia, and to have been on the site of the modern city of Troja,\r\nan episcopal see. The Compsani were the people of Compsa, the modern\r\nConza; and the Caudini were the inhabitants of Caudium, near which\r\nwere the Fauces Caudinæ or “Caudine Forks,” where the Roman army was\r\ncaptured by the Samnites. The site of this city was probably between\r\nthe modern Arpaja and Monte Sarchio; and the defeat is thought to have\r\ntaken place in the narrow valley between Santa Agata and Moirano, on\r\nthe road from the former place to Benevento, and traversed by the\r\nlittle river Iselero. The enumeration here beginning with the Æclani\r\nis thought by Hardouin to be of nations belonging to Apulia, and not\r\nto the Hirpini. The Æclani, here mentioned, were probably the people\r\nof the place now called Ascoli di Satriano, not far from the river\r\nCarapella. Of the Aletrini and Atrani nothing appears to be known.\r\n\r\n[1707] Probably the people of Affilæ, still called Affile, and seven\r\nmiles from Subiaco. Inscriptions and fragments of columns are still\r\nfound there.\r\n\r\n[1708] The people of Atinum, a town of Lucania, situate in the upper\r\nvalley of the Tanager, now the Valle di Diano. Its site is ascertained\r\nby the ruins near the village of Atena, five miles north of La Sala.\r\nCollatia was situate on the Anio, now called the Teverone.\r\n\r\n[1709] The ruins of the town of Canuæ are still visible at a place\r\ncalled Canne, about eight miles from Canosa. The Romans were defeated\r\nby Hannibal, on the banks of the Aufidus in its vicinity, but there is\r\nconsiderable question as to the exact locality. The ruins of the town\r\nare still considerable.\r\n\r\n[1710] Forentum was the site of the present Forenza in the Basilicate.\r\nIt is called by Horace and Diodorus Siculus, Ferentum. The ancient town\r\nprobably stood on a plain below the modern one. Some remains of it are\r\nstill to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1711] On the site of Genusium stands the modern Ginosa. The ruins of\r\nthe ancient city of Herdonea are still to be seen in the vicinity of\r\nthe modern Ordona, on the high road from Naples to Otranto. This place\r\nwitnessed the defeat by Hannibal of the Romans twice in two years.\r\n\r\n[1712] The mention of the Hyrini, or people of Hyrium or Hyria, is\r\nprobably an error, as he has already mentioned Uria, the same place,\r\namong the Daunian Apulians, and as on the sea-shore. See p. 228. It is\r\nnot improbably a corrupted form of some other name.\r\n\r\n[1713] From the Frento, on the banks of which they dwelt.\r\n\r\n[1714] Viesta, on the promontory of Gargano, is said to occupy the site\r\nof the ancient Merinum.\r\n\r\n[1715] According to Mannert, the modern town of Noja stands on the site\r\nof ancient Netium.\r\n\r\n[1716] They inhabited Ruvo, in the territory of Bari, according to\r\nHardouin.\r\n\r\n[1717] Their town was Silvium; probably on the site of the modern\r\nSavigliano.\r\n\r\n[1718] According to D’Anville their town was Strabellum, now called\r\nRapolla.\r\n\r\n[1719] Their town is supposed to have been on the site of the modern\r\nBovino, in the Capitanata.\r\n\r\n[1720] The people of Apamestæ; probably on the site of the modern San\r\nVito, two miles west of Polignano.\r\n\r\n[1721] The people of Butuntum, now Bitonto, an inland city of Apulia,\r\ntwelve miles from Barium, and five from the sea. No particulars of it\r\nare known. All particulars too of most of the following tribes have\r\nperished.\r\n\r\n[1722] D’Anville places their city, Sturni, at the present Ostuni, not\r\nfar from the Adriatic, and fourteen leagues from Otranto.\r\n\r\n[1723] The people of Aletium already mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1724] Their town possibly stood on the site of the present village of\r\nVeste, to the west of Castro. The Neretini were probably the people of\r\nthe present Nardo.\r\n\r\n[1725] Probably the people of the town which stood on the site of the\r\npresent San Verato.\r\n\r\n[1726] They occupied what is now called the Abruzzo Inferiore.\r\n\r\n[1727] Now the Trigno.\r\n\r\n[1728] On the site of the present Vasto d’Ammone, five miles south of\r\nthe Punta della Penna. There are numerous remains of the ancient city.\r\n\r\n[1729] According to Strabo Buca bordered on the territory of Teanum,\r\nwhich would place its site at Termoli, a seaport three miles from the\r\nmouth of the Biferno or Tifernus. Other writers, however, following\r\nPliny, have placed it on the Punta della Penna, where considerable\r\nremains were visible in the 17th century. Ortona still retains its\r\nancient name.\r\n\r\n[1730] Now the Pescara.\r\n\r\n[1731] The sites of their towns are unknown; but D’Anville supposes the\r\nHigher or Upper Carentum to have occupied the site of the modern Civita\r\nBurella, and the Lower one the Civita del Conte.\r\n\r\n[1732] Teate is supposed to be the present Chieti.\r\n\r\n[1733] The people of Corfinium, the chief city of the Peligni. It is\r\nsupposed to have remained in existence up to the tenth century. Its\r\nruins are seen near Pentima, about the church of San Pelino.\r\n\r\n[1734] The site of Superæquum is occupied by the present Castel Vecchio\r\nSubequo.\r\n\r\n[1735] The people of Sulmo, a town ninety miles from Rome. It was the\r\nbirth-place of Ovid, and was famous for the coldness of its waters, a\r\ncircumstance mentioned by Ovid in his Tristia, B. iv. ch. x. l. 4. It\r\nis now called Sulmona.\r\n\r\n[1736] The people of Anxanum or Anxa, on the Sangro, now known as the\r\ncity of Lanciano; in the part of which, known as Lanciano Vecchio,\r\nremains of the ancient town are to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1737] The people probably of Atina in Samnium, which still retains the\r\nsame name.\r\n\r\n[1738] They probably took their name from the Lake Fucinus, the modern\r\nLago Fucino, or Lago di Celano.\r\n\r\n[1739] They dwelt in a town on the verge of Lake Fucinus, known as\r\nLucus.\r\n\r\n[1740] The ruins of Marruvium may still be seen at Muria, on the\r\neastern side of Lake Fucinus.\r\n\r\n[1741] It has been suggested, from the discovery of a sepulchral\r\ninscription there, that Capradosso, about nine miles from Rieti in the\r\nupper valley of the Salto, is the site of ancient Cliternia. The small\r\nvillage of Alba retains the name and site of the former city of Alba\r\nFucensis, of which there are considerable remains.\r\n\r\n[1742] The modern town of Carsoli is situate three miles from the site\r\nof ancient Carseoli, the remains of which are still visible at Civita\r\nnear the Ostoria del Cavaliere. Ovid tells us that its climate was cold\r\nand bleak, and that it would not grow olives, though fruitful in corn.\r\nHe also gives some other curious particulars of the place.—Fasti, B.\r\niv. l. 683 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[1743] The modern Civita Sant Angelo retains nearly its ancient name as\r\nthat of its patron saint. It is situate on a hill, four miles from the\r\nAdriatic, and south of the river Matrinus, which separated the Vestini\r\nfrom the territories of Adria and Picenum.\r\n\r\n[1744] The village of Ofena, twelve miles north of Popoli, is supposed\r\nto retain the site of ancient Aufina. Numerous antiquities have been\r\nfound here.\r\n\r\n[1745] Cato in his ‘Origines’ stated that they were so called from the\r\nfact of their being descended from the Sabines.\r\n\r\n[1746] The site of the town of Bovianum is occupied by the modern\r\ncity of Bojano; the remains of the walls are visible. Mommsen however\r\nconsiders Bojano to be the site of only Bovianum Undecumanorum, or\r\n“of the Eleventh Legion,” and considers that the site of the ancient\r\nSamnite city of Bovianum Vetus is the place called Piettrabondante,\r\nnear Agnone, twenty miles to the north, where there appear to be the\r\nremains of an ancient city.\r\n\r\n[1747] The people of Aufidena, a city of northern Samnium, in the upper\r\nvalley of the Sagrus or Sagro. Its remains, which show it to have been\r\na place of very great strength, are to be seen near the modern village\r\nof Alfidena, on a hill on the left bank of the modern Sangro.\r\n\r\n[1748] The people of Esernia, now Isernia.\r\n\r\n[1749] The people of Ficulia or Ficolea, a city of ancient Latium\r\non the Via Nomentana. It is supposed that it was situate within the\r\nconfines of the domain of Cesarini, and upon either the hill now called\r\nMonte Gentile, or that marked by the Torre Lupara.\r\n\r\n[1750] Sæpinum is supposed to be the same with the modern Supino or\r\nSipicciano.\r\n\r\n[1751] The ruins of the ancient Sabine city of Amiternum are still\r\nvisible at San Vittorino, a village about five miles north of Aquila.\r\nConsiderable remains of antiquity are still to be seen there.\r\n\r\n[1752] The people of Cures, an ancient city of the Sabines, to the left\r\nof the Via Salaria, about three miles from the left bank of the Tiber,\r\nand twenty-four from Rome. It was the birth-place of Numa Pompilius.\r\nIts site is occupied by the present villages of Correse and Arci, and\r\nconsiderable remains of the ancient city are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1753] Nothing is known of this place; but it has been suggested that\r\nit stood in the neighbourhood of Forum Novum (or ‘New Market’), next\r\nmentioned, the present Vescovio.\r\n\r\n[1754] This Interamna must not be confounded with Interamna Lirinas,\r\nmentioned in C. 9, nor Interamna Nartis, mentioned in C. 19. It was a\r\ncity of Picenum in the territory of the Prætutii. The city of Teramo\r\nstands on its site; and extensive remains of the ancient city are still\r\nin existence.\r\n\r\n[1755] From their town, Norsia in the duchy of Spoleto is said to\r\nderive its name.\r\n\r\n[1756] The people of Nomentum, now La Mentana.\r\n\r\n[1757] The people of Reate, now Rieti, below Mursia.\r\n\r\n[1758] The people of Trebulæ Mutuscæ, said to have stood on the site\r\nof the present Monte Leone della Sabina, below Rieti. This place\r\nis mentioned in the seventh Æneid of Virgil, as the “Olive-bearing\r\nMutuscæ.”\r\n\r\n[1759] Their town was Trebula Suffena, on the site of the present\r\nMontorio di Romagna. The Tiburtes were the people of Tibur, the modern\r\nTivoli; and the Tarinates were the inhabitants of Tarinum, now Tarano.\r\n\r\n[1760] The people of Cominium, the site of which is uncertain. It\r\nis supposed that there were three places of this name. One Cominium\r\nis mentioned in the Samnite wars as being about twenty miles from\r\nAquilonia, while Cominium Ceritum, probably another place, is spoken\r\nof by Livy in his account of the second Punic War. The latter, it is\r\nsuggested, was about sixteen miles north-west of Beneventum, and on the\r\nsite of the modern Cerreto. The Comini here mentioned by Pliny, it is\r\nthought, dwelt in neither of the above places. The sites of the towns\r\nof many of the peoples here mentioned are also equally unknown.\r\n\r\n[1761] Solinus, B. ii., also states, that this place was founded by\r\nMarsyas, king of the Lydians. Hardouin mentions that in his time the\r\nremains of this town were said to be seen on the verge of the lake near\r\nTransaco.\r\n\r\n[1762] From the Greek σέβεσθαι “to worship.”\r\n\r\n[1763] The river Velinus, now Velino, rising in the Apennines, in\r\nthe vicinity of Reate, overflowed its banks and formed several small\r\nlakes, the largest of which was called Lake Velinus, now Pie di Lugo or\r\nLago, while a smaller one was called Lacus Reatinus, now Lago di Santa\r\nSusanna. In order to carry off these waters, a channel was cut through\r\nthe rocks by Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of the Sabines, by means of\r\nwhich the waters of the Velinus were carried through a narrow gorge to\r\na spot where they fall from a height of several hundred feet into the\r\nriver Nar. This fall is now known as the Fall of Terni or the Cascade\r\nDelle Marmore.\r\n\r\n[1764] Still called Monte Fiscello, near the town of Civita Reale.\r\nVirgil calls the Nar (now the Nera), “Sulphureâ Nar albus aquâ,” “The\r\nwhite Nar with its sulphureous waters.”—Æneid, vii. 517.\r\n\r\n[1765] A Sabine divinity said to have been identical with Victory.\r\nThe Romans however made her the goddess of leisure and repose, and\r\nrepresented her as being worshiped by the husbandmen at harvest home,\r\nwhen they were “vacui,” or at leisure. She is mentioned by Ovid in\r\nthe Fasti, B. vi. l. 307. The grove here alluded to was one of her\r\nsanctuaries.\r\n\r\n[1766] The modern Teverone, which rises near Tervi or Trevi.\r\n\r\n[1767] A town of the Æqui, now known as Subiaco. In its vicinity was\r\nthe celebrated villa of Claudius and Nero, called the Villa Sublacencis.\r\n\r\n[1768] This was a town of the Sabines between Reate and Interocrea,\r\nin the vicinity of a small lake of the same name. It was a mere pool,\r\naccording to Dionysius, being but 400 feet in diameter. It is supposed\r\nthat the floating island was formed from the incrustations of carbonate\r\nof lime on the banks, which, becoming detached, probably collected\r\nin the middle. The lake still exists, but the floating island has\r\ndisappeared. There are some fine ruins of Roman baths in the vicinity\r\nof the lake.\r\n\r\n[1769] It was a custom with the early Italian nations, especially the\r\nSabines, in times of danger and distress, to vow to the deity the\r\nsacrifice of all the produce of the ensuing spring, that is, of the\r\nperiod from the first day of March till the last day of April. It is\r\nprobable that in early times human sacrifices were the consequence;\r\nbut at a later period the following custom was adopted instead. The\r\nchildren were allowed to grow up, and in the spring of their twentieth\r\nor twenty-first year were with covered faces driven across the frontier\r\nof their native country, to go whithersoever chance or the guidance of\r\nthe deity might lead them. The Mamertini in Sicily were said to have\r\nhad this origin.\r\n\r\n[1770] Now the Aterno, which falls into the sea at Atri or Ortona.\r\n\r\n[1771] A famous city of Etruscan origin, which still retains its name\r\nof Adria or Atri. It had very considerable intercourse with Greece,\r\nand there are extensive remains of antiquity in its vicinity, towards\r\nRavegnano. The river is still called the Vomano.\r\n\r\n[1772] These places are again mentioned in B. xiv. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[1773] Or “New Castle.” It probably occupied the site of the now\r\ndeserted town of Santo Flaviano, near the banks of the river Tordino,\r\nthe Batinus of Pliny, and below the modern town of Giulia Nova.\r\n\r\n[1774] The river still has the name of Tronto; Porto di Martin Scuro\r\noccupies the site of the town.\r\n\r\n[1775] Who had crossed over as colonists from the opposite coast of\r\nIllyricum.\r\n\r\n[1776] According to Mannert the river Tesino is the same as the Albula,\r\nand Tervium is the modern town of Grotte a Mare; but D’Anville makes\r\nthe latter to be the town of Cupra next mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1777] This was called Cupra Maritima, to distinguish it from the town\r\nof the Cuprenses Montani, afterwards mentioned. It is said by Strabo to\r\nhave had its name from the Tyrrhenian name of Juno. From the discovery\r\nof an inscription belonging to her temple here, there is little doubt\r\nthat D’Anville is right in his suggestion that the site of Cupra is at\r\nGrotte a Mare, eight miles from the mouth of the Truentus or Tronto.\r\n\r\n[1778] “The Fortress of the Firmani,” five miles from Firmum, an\r\nimportant city of Picenum. The Fortress was situate at the mouth of the\r\nLeta, and was the port of the city. It is still called Porto di Fermo.\r\n\r\n[1779] Often called “Asculum Picenum” to distinguish it from Asculum\r\nin Apulia. It was a place of considerable strength, and played a great\r\npart in the Social War. It is unknown at what period it became a Roman\r\ncolony. The modern city of Ascoli stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1780] Now called Monte Novano, according to D’Anville and Brotier.\r\n\r\n[1781] Its site is supposed to have been that of the small town called\r\nSanto Elpidio a Mare, four miles from the sea, and the same distance\r\nnorth of Fermo. The remains of Potentia are supposed to be those in the\r\nvicinity of the modern Porto di Recanati. Numana is supposed to be the\r\nmodern Umana, near the Cuscione, where, in the seventeenth century,\r\nextensive ruins were to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1782] It still retains its ancient name, which was derived from the\r\nGreek ἀγκὼν “the elbow,” it being situate on a promontory which forms\r\na curve, and almost encloses the port. The promontory is still called\r\nMonte Comero. A triumphal arch, erected in honour of Trajan, who\r\nconstructed a new mole for the port, is still in fine preservation, and\r\nthere are remains of an amphitheatre.\r\n\r\n[1783] The modern city of Osimo stands on the site of Auximum, about\r\ntwelve miles south-west of Ancona. Numerous inscriptions, statues, and\r\nother remains have been found there.\r\n\r\n[1784] Cluver conjectures that Beregra stood at Civitella di Tronto,\r\nten miles north of Teramo; but nothing further relative to it is known.\r\nCingulum was situate on a lofty mountain; the modern town of Cingoli\r\noccupies its site.\r\n\r\n[1785] “The mountaineers.” They inhabited Cupra Montana, which is\r\nsupposed to have stood on the same site as the modern Ripa Transone.\r\n\r\n[1786] The people of Falaria or Faleria. There are considerable remains\r\nof this town about a mile from the village of Falerona, among which a\r\ntheatre and amphitheatre are most conspicuous. The remains of Pausula\r\nare supposed to be those seen on the Monte dell’ Olmo. The town of\r\nthe Ricinenses is supposed to have been on the banks of the Potenza,\r\ntwo miles from Macerata, where some remains were to be seen in the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[1787] Septempeda is supposed to have occupied the site of the modern\r\nSan Severino, on the river Potenza. Tollentinum or Tollentura was\r\nprobably on the site of the modern Tolentino. The town of the Treienses\r\nis supposed to have occupied a site near the modern San Severino, in\r\nthe vicinity of Montecchio.\r\n\r\n[1788] A colony of the people of Pollentia was established at Urbs\r\nSalvia, occupying the site of the modern Urbisaglia on the bank of the\r\nChiento.\r\n\r\n[1789] Cisalpine Gaul was so called because the inhabitants adopted the\r\nuse of the Roman toga.\r\n\r\n[1790] This fanciful derivation would make their name to come from the\r\nGreek ὄμβρος “a shower.”\r\n\r\n[1791] Now the Esino.\r\n\r\n[1792] So called from the Galli Senones. The modern city of Sinigaglia\r\noccupies its site. The river Metaurus is still called the Metauro.\r\n\r\n[1793] “The Temple of Fortune.” At this spot the Flaminian Way joined\r\nthe road from Ancona and Picenum to Ariminum. The modern city of Fano\r\noccupies the site, but there are few remains of antiquity.\r\n\r\n[1794] The modern Pesaro occupies the site of the town; the river is\r\ncalled the Foglia.\r\n\r\n[1795] This was a flourishing town of Umbria. Augustus showed it\r\nespecial favour and bestowed on it the Grove and Temple of Clitumnus,\r\nthough at twelve miles’ distance from the town. The modern town of\r\nSpello occupies its site, and very extensive remains of antiquity\r\nare still to be seen. It probably received two Roman colonies, as\r\ninscriptions mention the “Colonia Julia Hispelli” and the “Colonia\r\nUrbana Flavia.” It is considered probable that Hispellum, rather than\r\nMevania, was the birth-place of the poet Propertius. Tuder is supposed\r\nto have occupied the site of the modern Todi, on the Tiber.\r\n\r\n[1796] The people of Ameria, an important and flourishing city of\r\nUmbria. There are still remains of the ancient walls; the modern town\r\nof Amelia occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[1797] The site of Attidium is marked by the modern village of Attigio,\r\ntwo miles south of the city of Fabriano, to which the inhabitants of\r\nAttidium are supposed to have migrated in the middle ages.\r\n\r\n[1798] The people of Asisium. The modern city of Assisi (the\r\nbirth-place of St. Francis) occupies its site. There are considerable\r\nremains of the ancient town.\r\n\r\n[1799] The people of Arna, the site of which is now occupied by the\r\ntown of Civitella d’Arno, five miles east of Perugia. Some inscriptions\r\nand other objects of antiquity have been found here.\r\n\r\n[1800] The people of Æsis, situate on the river of the same name. It is\r\nstill called Iesi. Pliny, in B. xi. c. 97, mentions it as famous for\r\nthe excellence of its cheeses.\r\n\r\n[1801] The people of Camerinum, a city of Umbria. The present Camerino\r\noccupies its site. Its people were among the most considerable of\r\nUmbria. The site of the Casuentillani does not appear to be known.\r\n\r\n[1802] The people of Carsulæ, an Umbrian town of some importance. Its\r\nruins are still visible about half way between San Germino and Acqua\r\nSparta, ten miles north of Narni. Holsten states that the site was\r\nstill called Carsoli in his time, and there existed remains of an\r\namphitheatre and a triumphal arch in honour of Trajan. Nothing seems to\r\nbe known of the Dolates.\r\n\r\n[1803] The people of Fulginium. From Cicero we learn that it was a\r\nmunicipal town. The modern city of Foligno has risen on its site.\r\nAn inscription discovered here has preserved the name of Fulginia,\r\nprobably a local divinity.\r\n\r\n[1804] The people of Forum Flaminii, situated on the Flaminian Way,\r\nwhere it first entered the Apennines, three miles from Fulginium. It\r\nwas here that the Emperors Gallus and Volusianus were defeated and\r\nslain by Æmilianus, A.D. 256. The ruins at the spot called Giovanni pro\r\nFiamma mark its site. The site of Forum Julii appears to be unknown, as\r\nalso that of Forum Brentani.\r\n\r\n[1805] The people of Forum Sempronii, the only town in the valley of\r\nthe Metaurus. The modern city of Fossombrone, two miles distant, has\r\nthence taken its name. Considerable vestiges of the ancient town are\r\nstill to be seen. The battle in which Hasdrubal was defeated by the\r\nRoman consuls Livius and Nero, B.C. 207, was probably fought in its\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\n[1806] The people of Iguvium, an ancient and important town of Umbria.\r\nIts site is occupied by the modern city of Gubbio. Interamna on the Nar\r\nhas been previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1807] The people of the town of Mevania, now called Bevagna, in the\r\nduchy of Spoleto. The Mevanionenses were the people of Mevanio, or\r\nMevaniolæ, in the vicinity of Mevania, and thought by Cluver to be the\r\nmodern Galeata.\r\n\r\n[1808] Their town was Matilica, which still retains that name. It is\r\nsituate in the Marches of Ancona.\r\n\r\n[1809] Their town still retains the name of Narni.\r\n\r\n[1810] Their town was surnamed Favonia and Camellaria, to distinguish\r\nit from several others of the same name. The present Nocera stands on\r\nits site.\r\n\r\n[1811] The people of Ocriculum, now Otricoli, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1812] According to Hardouin, the ruins of Ostra are those near Monte\r\nNuovo, now Sinigaglia, but D’Anville thinks that the modern Corinaldo\r\nmarks its site.\r\n\r\n[1813] Nothing is known of the Plestini, nor yet of the Pitulani, who\r\nseem to have been a different people to those mentioned in the First\r\nRegion.\r\n\r\n[1814] The town of Sentis, according to D’Anville and Mannert, was in\r\nthe vicinity of the modern town of Sasso Ferrato.\r\n\r\n[1815] The people of Sarsina, an important town of Umbria, famous as\r\nbeing the birth-place of the comic poet Plautus. It is now called\r\nSassina, on the Savio.\r\n\r\n[1816] The people of Spoletum, now Spoleto. It was a city of Umbria on\r\nthe Via Flaminia, colonized by the Romans B.C. 242. In the later days\r\nof the Empire it was taken by Totilas, and its walls destroyed. They\r\nwere however restored by Narses.\r\n\r\n[1817] The people of Suasa; the remains of which, according to\r\nD’Anville and Mannert, are those seen to the east of the town of San\r\nLorenzo, at a place called Castel Leone.\r\n\r\n[1818] The monastery of Sestino is supposed to stand on the site of\r\nSestinum, their town, at the source of the river Pesaro.\r\n\r\n[1819] The site of their town is denoted by the modern Sigello in the\r\nMarches of Ancona.\r\n\r\n[1820] Their town is supposed to have been also situate within the\r\npresent Marches of Ancona, where they join the Duchy of Spoleto.\r\n\r\n[1821] Their town was Trebia. The modern Trevi stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1822] The people of Tuficum, which Holsten thinks was situate between\r\nMatelica and Fabrianum, on the river called the Cesena.\r\n\r\n[1823] The site of Tifernum Tiberinum is occupied by the present Citta\r\ndi Castello, and that of Tifernum Metaurense, or “on the Metaurus,” by\r\nSant Angelo in Vado in the Duchy of Urbino. The first-named place was\r\nin the vicinity of the estates of the Younger Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1824] D’Anville and Mannert are of opinion that Urbania on the\r\nMetaurus, two leagues south-east of Urbino, marks the site of their\r\ntown. The Hortenses probably dwelt on the site of the present Urbino.\r\n\r\n[1825] The site of their town was probably the present Bettona. The\r\nsite of the towns of the peoples next mentioned is unknown.\r\n\r\n[1826] Nothing is known of its position. There were cities in Campania\r\nand Cisalpine Gaul also called Acerræ. The first has been mentioned\r\nunder the First Region. Of the other places and peoples mentioned in\r\nthis Chapter no particulars seem to have come down to us.\r\n\r\n[1827] Now the Conca. It is called “rapax Crustumium” by Lucan, B. ii.\r\nl. 406.\r\n\r\n[1828] One of the most important cities of Umbria. It played a\r\nconspicuous part in most of the internal wars of the Romans. The modern\r\ncity of Rimini which stands on its site, still retains two striking\r\nmonuments of its grandeur; the Roman bridge of marble, which crosses\r\nthe river Ariminus, erected by Augustus and Tiberius, and a triumphal\r\narch of marble, erected in honour of Augustus. The river Ariminus is\r\nnow called the Marocchia, and the Aprusa is the Ausa.\r\n\r\n[1829] A papal decree, issued in 1756, declared the river Lusa to\r\nhave been the ancient Rubicon, but the more general opinion is that\r\nthe Pisatello, a little to the north of it, has better claims to that\r\nhonour. On the north bank of the Rubicon a pillar was placed by a\r\ndecree of the Senate, with an inscription giving notice that whoever\r\nshould pass in arms into the Roman territory would be deemed an enemy\r\nto the state. It is especially celebrated in history by Cæsar’s passage\r\nacross it at the head of his army, by which act he declared war against\r\nthe republic. See Lucan, B. i. l. 200-230.\r\n\r\n[1830] The Sapis is the modern Savio, or Rio di Cesena; the Vitis is\r\nthe Bevano, and the Anemo is the Roncone.\r\n\r\n[1831] Strabo and Zosimus however state that it was first founded by\r\nthe Thessalians. Ravenna first came into notice on being made one of\r\nthe two chief stations of the Roman fleet. The harbour which was made\r\nfor it was called “Classes,” and between it and Ravenna sprang up\r\nthe town of Cæsarea. Though not deemed unhealthy, it lay in a swampy\r\ndistrict. Theodoric made it the capital of the kingdom of the Goths.\r\nThe modern city stands on the site of the ancient town. The river\r\nBedesis is now called the Montone.\r\n\r\n[1832] No remains of it are extant; but it is supposed that it stood\r\nnear the entrance of the Lagunes of Comacchio.\r\n\r\n[1833] The modern Bologna stands on its site, and there are but few\r\nremains of antiquity to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1834] He probably means only the Etruscan cities north of the\r\nApennines.\r\n\r\n[1835] The modern town of Brescello occupies its site. Here the Emperor\r\nOtho put an end to his life on learning the defeat of his troops by\r\nVitellius. It appears to have been a strong fortress in the time of the\r\nLombard kings.\r\n\r\n[1836] The modern Modena stands on its site. It was famous in the\r\nhistory of the civil wars after Cæsar’s death. Decimus Brutus was\r\nbesieged here by M. Antonius, in the years B.C. 44 and 43, and under\r\nits walls the consuls Hirtius and Pansa were slain. Its vicinity, like\r\nthat of Parma, was famous for the excellence of its wool.\r\n\r\n[1837] This was a Roman colony, which was enlarged by Augustus, and\r\nfrom him received the name of Colonia Julia Augusta. It was called,\r\nafter the fall of the Western Empire, Chrysopolis or the “Golden City.”\r\nThe modern city of Parma occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[1838] A Roman colony. The present city of Piacenza stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1839] It still retains the name of Cesena, and is a considerable\r\nplace. After the fall of the Western Empire it was used as a fortress\r\nof great strength. We shall find Pliny again mentioning it in B. xiv.\r\nc. 6, as famous for the goodness of its wines, a reputation which\r\nit still maintains. The name of Claterna, once a municipal town of\r\nimportance, is still retained in part by a small stream which crosses\r\nthe road nine miles from Bologna, and is called the Quaderna. An old\r\nchurch and a few houses, called Santa Maria di Quaderna, probably mark\r\nthe site of the vicinity of the town, which was situate on the high\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n[1840] This Forum Clodii is said by D’Anville to be the modern\r\nFornocchia. Forum Livii is supposed to have occupied the site of the\r\npresent city of Forli. Forum Popili or Forli Piccolo occupies the site\r\nof Forum or Foro Popili.\r\n\r\n[1841] This place is supposed to have stood on the spot where the\r\nepiscopal town of Bertinoro now stands. In inscriptions it is called\r\nForodruentinorum. Forum Cornelii, said to have been so called from the\r\nDictator Sylla, occupied the site of the modern town of Imola. The poet\r\nMartial is said to have resided for some time in this town.\r\n\r\n[1842] The people of Faventia, now Faenza. Pliny, B. xix. c. i., speaks\r\nof the whiteness of its linen, for the manufacture of which it was\r\ncelebrated. At this place Carbo and Norbanus were defeated with great\r\nloss by Metellus, the partisan of Sylla, in B.C. 82.\r\n\r\n[1843] The people of Fidentia. The present Borga di San Donnino stands\r\non its site, which is between Parma and Placentia, fifteen miles from\r\nthe former city.\r\n\r\n[1844] Cluver thinks that their town was on the site of the modern\r\nCastel Bondino.\r\n\r\n[1845] So named after Æmilius Lepidus. The people of Regium Lepidum,\r\nthe site of whose town is occupied by the modern Reggio.\r\n\r\n[1846] Solonatium is supposed to have had the site of the modern Citta\r\ndi Sole or Torre di Sole.\r\n\r\n[1847] Nothing certain is known of this people or their town, but it is\r\nthought by Rezzonico that by this name were meant those who occupied\r\nthe wood-clad heights of the Apennines, above Modena and Parma. Cicero\r\nmentions a Saltus Gallicanus as being a mountain of Campania, but that\r\nis clearly not the spot meant here.\r\n\r\n[1848] Their town is thought to have stood on the same site as the\r\nmodern Tenedo.\r\n\r\n[1849] Their town was perhaps on the same site as the modern Villac, on\r\nthe river Nura.\r\n\r\n[1850] The modern city of Ombria probably stands on the site of Urbana,\r\ntheir town, of which considerable remains are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1851] These and the Senones were nations of Cisalpine Gaul. The Boii\r\nemigrated originally from Transalpine Gaul, by the Penine Alps, or\r\nthe Pass of Great St. Bernard. They were completely subdued by Scipio\r\nNasica in B.C. 191, when he destroyed half of their population, and\r\ndeprived them of nearly half of their lands. They were ultimately\r\ndriven from their settlements, and established themselves in the modern\r\nBohemia, which from them takes its name. The Senones, who had taken the\r\ncity of Rome in B.C. 390, were conquered and the greater part of them\r\ndestroyed by the Consul Dolabella in B.C. 283.\r\n\r\n[1852] The Po, which rises in Monte Viso in Savoy.\r\n\r\n[1853] Already mentioned in C. 7 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[1854] Ovid in his account of the adventure of Phaëton (Met. B. ii.)\r\nstates that he fell into the river Padus.\r\n\r\n[1855] The Tanarus is still called the Tanaro. The Trebia, now the\r\nTrebbia, is memorable for the defeat on its banks of the Romans by\r\nHannibal, B.C. 218. The Incia is the modern Enza or Lenza, the Tarus\r\nthe Taro, the Gabellus the Secchia, the Scultenna the Panaro, and the\r\nRhenus the Reno.\r\n\r\n[1856] The Stura still has the same name; the Orgus is the modern\r\nOrco. The streams called Duriæ are known as the Dora Baltea and the\r\nDora Riparia; the Sessites is the Sesia, the Ticinus the Tessino, the\r\nLambrus the Lambro, the Addua the Adda, the Ollius the Oglio, and the\r\nMincius the Menzo.\r\n\r\n[1857] This seems to be the meaning of “gravis terræ,” unless it\r\nsignifies “pressing heavily upon the land,” and so cutting out channels\r\nfor its course. He has previously stated that, though rapid, it is not\r\nin the habit of carrying away its banks. See a very able article on the\r\nquestion whether the name Eridanus belonged originally to this river\r\nor to some other in the north of Europe, in Dr. Smith’s Dictionary of\r\nAncient Geography under the word “Eridanus.”\r\n\r\n[1858] That is to say, the canal made by Augustus was so called.\r\n\r\n[1859] It was on this occasion that, after a stay of only a few days\r\nin Britain, he quitted the island, returned to Rome, and celebrated\r\na splendid triumph. This outlet of the Po has now the name of Po di\r\nPrimero.\r\n\r\n[1860] Now the Santerno, noted for the sluggishness of its waters.\r\n\r\n[1861] The Ostium Caprasiæ is now called the Porto Interito di Bell’\r\nOchio, the Ostium Sagis the Porto di Magnavacca; Volane, or Volana, is\r\nthe south main branch of the river. The Ostia Carbonaria, mentioned\r\nbelow, was the north main branch, subdivided into several small\r\nbranches; and the Fossæ or Fossiones Philistinæ connected the river, by\r\nmeans of the Tartarus, with the Athesis.\r\n\r\n[1862] The reading is doubtful here, and even this, which is perhaps\r\nthe best, appears to be corrupt; for it is difficult to conceive how\r\nall the mouths previously mentioned could have been upon one canal, and\r\nbesides it would seem that Olane was one of the natural mouths of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n[1863] More generally Adria, from which, as Pliny says, the Adriatic\r\ntakes its name. Either a Greek, or, what is more probable, as Pliny\r\nstates, an Etruscan colony, it became the principal emporium of trade\r\nwith the Adriatic, in consequence of which it was surrounded with\r\ncanals and other works to facilitate its communications with other\r\nrivers. It is still called Adria, and in its vicinity to the south,\r\nconsiderable remains of the ancient city are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1864] So called from the Philistæi, said to have been the ancient\r\ninhabitants of the spot. They are now called the Bocca della Gnoca, the\r\nBocca della Scovetta, the Busa delle Tole, the Sbocco dell’ Asinino,\r\n&c. The Ostia Carbonaria and the Fossæ Philistinæ were to the north of\r\nthe ones previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1865] He seems to confound the Fosses of Philistina with the Tartarus\r\n(now Tartaro). That river however connected the Fosses of Philistina\r\nwith the Athesis, now the Adige.\r\n\r\n[1866] Now the Bacchiglione.\r\n\r\n[1867] The modern Brondolo.\r\n\r\n[1868] Now Chioggia, formed by the rivers Brenta and Brentella.\r\nHardouin thinks the Clodian Canal to be the same as the modern Fossa\r\nPaltana.\r\n\r\n[1869] Now Monteu di Po, below Chevasso, mentioned in the 7th Chapter.\r\n\r\n[1870] This place is supposed to have been situate in the vicinity of\r\nthe modern Saluzzo, on the north bank of the Po. Segusio occupied the\r\nsite of the modern Susa.\r\n\r\n[1871] Augusta of the Taurini. The present city of Turin stands on its\r\nsite. It was made a Roman colony by Augustus. With the exception of\r\nsome inscriptions, Turin retains no vestiges of antiquity.\r\n\r\n[1872] The present city of Aosta occupies its site. This was also a\r\nRoman colony founded by Augustus, after he had subdued the Salassi. It\r\nwas, as Pliny says in C. 5, the extreme point of Italy to the north.\r\nThe remains of the ancient city are of extreme magnificence.\r\n\r\n[1873] The Grecian pass of the Alps was that now known as the\r\nLittle St. Bernard; while the Penine pass was the present Great St.\r\nBernard. Livy in his History, B. xxi. c. 38, points out the error of\r\ntaking these mountains to have derived their name from the Pœni or\r\nCarthaginians. There is no doubt that they took their name from the\r\nCeltic word signifying a mountain, which now forms the “Pen” of the\r\nWelsh and the “Ben” of the Scotch.\r\n\r\n[1874] Now called Ivrea or Lamporeggio, at the entrance of the valley\r\nof the Salassi, the present Val d’Aosta. There are some remains of the\r\nancient town to be seen.\r\n\r\n[1875] The present town of Vercelli stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1876] Now called Novara, in the Duchy of Milan.\r\n\r\n[1877] It became a Roman municipal town, but owes its greatness to the\r\nLombard kings who made it their capital, and altered the name to Papia,\r\nnow Pavia.\r\n\r\n[1878] “Pompey’s Praises.” The present Lodi Vecchio marks its site.\r\n\r\n[1879] It was the capital of the Insubres, a Gallic nation, and was\r\ntaken by the Romans in B.C. 222, on which it became a municipium and\r\nRoman colony. On the division of the empire by Diocletian, it became\r\nthe residence of his colleague Maximianus, and continued to be the\r\nabode of the Emperors of the West till it was plundered by Attila, who\r\ntransferred the seat of government to Ravenna. It afterwards became the\r\ncapital of the kingdom of the Ostro-Goths, and was again sacked by the\r\nGoths in A.D. 539, and its inhabitants put to the sword. The present\r\ncity, known to us as Milan, contains no remains of antiquity.\r\n\r\n[1880] The modern Como and Bergamo stand on their sites.\r\n\r\n[1881] From its name, signifying the “market of Licinius,” it would\r\nappear to be of Roman origin. Its site is supposed to have been at a\r\nplace called Incino, near the town of Erba, between Como and Lecco,\r\nwhere inscriptions and other antiquities have been found.\r\n\r\n[1882] Deriving it from the Greek ὄρος, “a mountain,” and βίος, “life.”\r\n\r\n[1883] “Etiamnum prodente se altius quam fortunatius situm.” Hardouin\r\nseems to think that “se” refers to Cato, and that he informs us to that\r\neffect; but to all appearance, it relates rather to the town, which\r\neven yet, by its ruins, showed that it was perched too high among the\r\nmountains to be a fertile spot.\r\n\r\n[1884] The district of the Veneti. These people, taking refuge in the\r\nadjoining islands in the fifth century to escape the Huns under Attila,\r\nfounded the modern city of Venice.\r\n\r\n[1885] Now called the Sile, which flows past Trevigio or Treviso.\r\n\r\n[1886] The mountainous district in the vicinity of Tarvisium, the\r\nmodern Treviso.\r\n\r\n[1887] Situate in a marsh or lagune on the river Sile. It became a\r\nRoman colony after Pliny’s time, under the Emperor Trajan. Its villas\r\nare described by Martial as rivalling those of Baiæ. The Emperor Verus\r\ndied here A.D. 169. The modern village of Altino is a very impoverished\r\nplace. The Liquentia is now called the Livenza.\r\n\r\n[1888] Now called Oderzo, on the river Montegano, which flows into the\r\nLiquenza. The conduct of the people of this place, in the wars between\r\nPompey and Cæsar, is mentioned by Lucan, in his Pharsalia, B. iv. l.\r\n462.\r\n\r\n[1889] From inscriptions we find that this place was called Colonia\r\nJulia Concordia, from which it seems probable that it was one of the\r\ncolonies founded by Augustus to celebrate the restoration of peace. It\r\nrapidly rose into importance, and is often mentioned during the later\r\nages of the Roman Empire, as one of the most important cities in this\r\npart of Italy. It is now a poor village, with the same name, and no\r\nremains of antiquity beyond a few inscriptions.\r\n\r\n[1890] The Romatinum is the modern Lemene. Pliny seems to imply,\r\n(though from the uncertainty of the punctuation it is not clear,)\r\nthat on the Romatinum there was a port of that name. If so, it would\r\nprobably occupy the site of the present Santa Margherita, at the mouth\r\nof the Lemene.\r\n\r\n[1891] The greater Tiliaventum is the modern Tagliamento; and Hardouin\r\nsuggests that the smaller river of that name is the Lugugnana.\r\n\r\n[1892] This river is supposed to be the same with the modern Stella,\r\nand the Varamus the Revonchi, which joins the Stella.\r\n\r\n[1893] Now called the Ansa. The Natiso is the modern Natisone, and the\r\nTurrus the Torre; the former flowed past Aquileia on the west, the\r\nlatter on the east, in former times, but their course is probably now\r\nchanged, and they fall into the Isonzo, four miles from the city.\r\n\r\n[1894] The capital of Venetia, and one of the most important cities of\r\nNorthern Italy. In the year A.D. 452 it was besieged by Attila, king\r\nof the Huns, taken by storm, and plundered and burnt to the ground. On\r\nits site, which is very unhealthy, is the modern village of Aquileia,\r\nwith about 1400 inhabitants. No ruins of any buildings are visible, but\r\nthe site abounds with coins, shafts of columns, inscriptions, and other\r\nremains of antiquity.\r\n\r\n[1895] Ptolemy states that Concordia and Aquileia were situate in the\r\ndistrict of the Carni.\r\n\r\n[1896] Still called the Timavo.\r\n\r\n[1897] Castel Duino stands on its site. It will be found again\r\nmentioned in B. xiv. C. 8, for the excellence of its wines.\r\n\r\n[1898] Now the Gulf of Trieste. Tergeste was previously an\r\ninsignificant place, but made a Roman colony by Vespasian. The modern\r\ncity of Trieste occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[1899] Most probably the modern Risano. Cluver and D’Anville are of\r\nthat opinion, but Walckenaer thinks that it was a small stream near\r\nMuja Yecchia; which seems however to be too near Trieste.\r\n\r\n[1900] In the time of Augustus, and before Istria was added as a\r\nprovince to Italy.\r\n\r\n[1901] He alludes to an old tradition that the Argonauts sailed into\r\nthe Ister or Danube, and then into the Save, till they came to the spot\r\nwhere the modern town of Upper Laybach stands, and that here they built\r\nNauportus, after which they carried their ship across the mountains on\r\nmen’s shoulders into the Adriatic. He intends to suggest therefore that\r\nthe place had its name from the Greek ναῦς “a ship” and πορθμὸς “a\r\npassage.”\r\n\r\n[1902] The modern town of Laybach stands on its site. It is situate on\r\nthe Save, and on the road from Aquileia to Celeia. The Roman remains\r\nprove that the ancient city exceeded the modern one in magnitude.\r\nAccording to tradition it was founded by the Argonauts. It subsequently\r\nbecame a Roman colony, with the title of Julia Augusta. It is again\r\nmentioned in C. 28.\r\n\r\n[1903] Now the Golfo di Quarnaro. Liburnia was separated from Istria on\r\nthe north-west by the river Arsia, and from Dalmatia on the south by\r\nthe river Titus or Kerka, corresponding to the western part of modern\r\nCroatia, and the northern part of modern Dalmatia. Iapydia was situate\r\nto the north of Dalmatia and east of Liburnia, or the present military\r\nfrontier of Croatia, between the rivers Kulpa and Korana to the north\r\nand east, and the Velebich mountains to the south. Istria consisted of\r\nthe peninsula which still bears the same appellation.\r\n\r\n[1904] This passage, “while others make it 225,” is omitted in many\r\nof the MSS. and most of the editions. If it is retained, it is not\r\nimprobable that his meaning is, “and the circumference of Liburnia\r\nwhich joins it, with the Flanatic Gulf, some make 225, while others\r\nmake the compass of Liburnia to be 180 miles.” It depends on the\r\npunctuation and the force of “item,” and the question whether the\r\npassage is not in a corrupt state; and it is not at all clear what his\r\nmeaning really is.\r\n\r\n[1905] He alludes to C. Sempronius Tuditanus, Consul B.C. 129. He\r\ngained his victory over the Iapydes chiefly through the skill of his\r\nlegatus, D. Junius Brutus. He was a distinguished orator and historian.\r\nHe was the maternal grandfather of the orator Hortensius.\r\n\r\n[1906] This place is only mentioned by Pliny, but from an inscription\r\nfound, it appears that the emperor Justin II. conferred on it the title\r\nof Justinopolis. It is thought that it occupied the site of the present\r\ntown of Capo d’Istria.—Parentium stood on the site of the present\r\nParenzo.\r\n\r\n[1907] It still retains its name.\r\n\r\n[1908] Supposed to have occupied the site of the modern Castel Nuovo,\r\npast which the Arsia, now the Arsa, flows.\r\n\r\n[1909] Since Istria had been added to it by Augustus.\r\n\r\n[1910] Livy seems to imply that Cremona was originally included in\r\nthe territory of the Insubres. A Roman colony being established there\r\nit became a powerful city. It was destroyed by Antonius, the general\r\nof Vespasian, and again by the Lombard king Agilulfus in A.D. 605. No\r\nremains of antiquity, except a few inscriptions, are to be seen in the\r\nmodern city.\r\n\r\n[1911] The modern city of Este stands on the site of Ateste. Beyond\r\ninscriptions there are no remains of this Roman colony.\r\n\r\n[1912] Asolo stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1913] It was said to have been founded by the Trojan Antenor. Under\r\nthe Romans it was the most important city in the north of Italy, and by\r\nits commerce and manufactures attained great opulence. It was plundered\r\nby Attila, and, by Agilulfus, king of the Lombards, was razed to the\r\nground. It was celebrated as being the birth-place of Livy. Modern\r\nPadua stands on its site, but has no remains of antiquity.\r\n\r\n[1914] Now called Belluno. Vicetia has been succeeded by the modern\r\nVicenza.\r\n\r\n[1915] Mantua was not a place of importance, but was famous as being\r\nthe birth-place of Virgil; at least, the poet, who was born at the\r\nvillage of Andes, in its vicinity, regarded it as such. It was said to\r\nhave had its name from Manto, the daughter of Tiresias. Virgil, in the\r\nÆneid, B. x., alludes to its supposed Tuscan origin.\r\n\r\n[1916] Led by Antenor, as Livy says, B. i.\r\n\r\n[1917] The Cenomanni, a tribe of the Cisalpine Gauls, seem to have\r\noccupied the country north of the Padus, between the Insubres on the\r\nwest and the Veneti on the east. From Polybius and Livy we learn that\r\nthey had crossed the Alps within historical memory, and had expelled\r\nthe Etruscans and occupied their territory. They were signalized for\r\ntheir amicable feelings towards the Roman state.\r\n\r\n[1918] Their town was Fertria or Feltria, the modern Feltre.\r\n\r\n[1919] The modern city of Trento or Trent occupies the site of\r\nTridentum, their town. It is situate on the Athesis or Adige. It became\r\nfamous in the middle ages, and the great ecclesiastical council met\r\nhere in 1545.\r\n\r\n[1920] It was a Roman colony under the name of Colonia Augusta, having\r\noriginally been the capital of the Euganei, and then of the Cenomanni.\r\nIt was the birth-place of Catullus, and according to some accounts, of\r\nour author, Pliny. Modern Verona exhibits many remains of antiquity.\r\n\r\n[1921] D’Anville says that the ruins of this town are to be seen at the\r\nmodern Zuglio.\r\n\r\n[1922] Hardouin thinks that their town, Flamonia, stood on the site of\r\nthe modern Flagogna.\r\n\r\n[1923] Their town, Forum Julii, a Roman colony, stood on the site of\r\nthe modern Friuli. Paulus Diaconus ascribes its foundation to Julius\r\nCæsar.\r\n\r\n[1924] Supposed by Miller to have inhabited the town now called Nadin\r\nor Susied.\r\n\r\n[1925] Their town was probably on the site of the modern Quero, on the\r\nriver Piave, below Feltre.\r\n\r\n[1926] Probably the same as the Tarvisani, whose town was Tarvisium,\r\nnow Treviso.\r\n\r\n[1927] The conqueror of Syracuse. The fact here related probably took\r\nplace in the Gallic war.\r\n\r\n[1928] This must be the meaning; and we must not, as Holland does,\r\nemploy the number as signifying that of the lakes and rivers; for the\r\nTicinus is in the eleventh region.\r\n\r\n[1929] Now the Adda, running through Lago di Como, the Tesino through\r\nLago Maggiore, the Mincio through Lago di Garda, the Seo through Lago\r\ndi Seo, and the Lambro now communicating with the two small lakes\r\ncalled Lago di Pusiano and Lago d’Alserio, which in Pliny’s time\r\nprobably formed one large lake.\r\n\r\n[1930] Now Vado in Liguria, the harbour of Sabbata or Savo. Using the\r\nmodern names, the line thus drawn runs past Vado, Turin, Como, Brescia,\r\nVerona, Vicenza, Oderzo, Aquileia, Trieste, Pola, and the Arsa.\r\n\r\n[1931] It is from this people that the group of volcanic hills between\r\nPadua and Verona derive their present name of Colli Euganei or the\r\n“Euganean Hills.” From the Triumpilini and the Camuni, the present Val\r\nCamonica and Val Trompia derive their names.\r\n\r\n[1932] Probably meaning, that for a sum of money they originally\r\nacknowledged their subjection to the Roman power.\r\n\r\n[1933] The Lepontii probably dwelt in the modern Val Leventina and the\r\nVal d’Osula, near Lago Maggiore; the Salassi in the Val d’Aosta.\r\n\r\n[1934] Making it to come from the Greek verb λείπω, “to leave behind.”\r\n\r\n[1935] As though being εὐγένειοι or εὐγενεῖς, “of honourable descent,”\r\nor “parentage.”\r\n\r\n[1936] Strabo mentions the Stoni or Stœni among the minor Alpine\r\ntribes. Mannert thinks that they dwelt near the sources of the river\r\nChiese, about the site of the modern village of Storo.\r\n\r\n[1937] It has been suggested that from them the modern Valtelline takes\r\nits name.\r\n\r\n[1938] Hardouin suggests that the Suanetes, who are again mentioned,\r\nare the people here meant.\r\n\r\n[1939] They are supposed to have dwelt in the present canton of\r\nMartignac in the Valais, and the Vaudois.\r\n\r\n[1940] They dwelt in the Tarantaise, in the duchy of Savoy. The village\r\ncalled Centron still retains their name.\r\n\r\n[1941] The states subject to Cottius, an Alpine chief, who having\r\ngained the favour of Augustus, was left by him in possession of this\r\nportion of the Alps, with the title of Præfect. These states, in\r\nthe vicinity of the modern Mount Cenis, seem to have extended from\r\nEbrodunum or Embrun in Gaul, to Segusio, the modern Susa, in Italy,\r\nincluding the Pass of Mont Genèvre. The territory of Cottius was united\r\nby Nero to the Roman empire, as a separate province called the “Alpes\r\nCottiæ.”\r\n\r\n[1942] They dwelt in the vicinity of Ebrodunum or Embrun already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[1943] The “mountaineers.” Some editions read here “Appuani,” so called\r\nfrom the town of Appua, now Pontremoli.\r\n\r\n[1944] The Vagienni, and the Capillati Ligures, or “Long-haired\r\nLigurians,” have been previously mentioned in Chap. 7.\r\n\r\n[1945] The trophy or triumphal arch which bore this inscription is that\r\nwhich was still to be seen at Torbia near Nicæa in Illyria, in the time\r\nof Gruter, who has given that portion of the inscription which remained\r\nunobliterated, down to “gentes Alpinæ,” “the Alpine nations.” Hardouin\r\nspeaks of another triumphal arch in honour of Augustus at Segusio or\r\nSusa in Piedmont, which appears to have commenced in a somewhat similar\r\nmanner, but only the first twelve words were remaining in 1671.\r\n\r\n[1946] Adopted son of his great uncle Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\n[1947] Most of the MSS. omit the figures XVII here, but it is evidently\r\nan accident; if indeed they were omitted in the original.\r\n\r\n[1948] They are supposed to have occupied the Val Venosco, at the\r\nsources of the Adige. The Isarci dwelt in the Val de Sarra or Sarcha,\r\nnear Val Camonica; and the Breuni in the Val Brounia or Bregna, at the\r\nsource of the Tessino.\r\n\r\n[1949] D’Anville thinks that they inhabited the Val d’Agno, near\r\nTrento, between Lake Como and the Adige. He also detects the name of\r\nthe Focunates in the village of Vogogna.\r\n\r\n[1950] They inhabited the banks of the river Lech, their town being,\r\naccording to Strabo, Damasia, afterwards Augusta Vindelicorum, now\r\nAugsburg.\r\n\r\n[1951] Probably the Sarunetes, already mentioned. The Brixentes\r\ninhabited the modern Brixen in the Tyrol. The Lepontii have been\r\npreviously mentioned. The Seduni occupied the present Sion, the capital\r\nof the Valais. The Salassi have been already mentioned. According to\r\nBouche, the Medulli occupied the modern Maurienne in Savoy. The Varagri\r\ndwelt in Le Chablais.\r\n\r\n[1952] The Uceni, according to Hardouin, occupied Le Bourg d’Oysans in\r\nthe modern Graisivaudan; the Caturiges, the modern Chorges according to\r\nAnsart; the Brigiani, probably Briançon, and the Nemaloni, as Hardouin\r\nthinks, the place called Miolans.\r\n\r\n[1953] They probably dwelt in the Ville de Seyne, in Embrun; the\r\nEsubiani near the river Hubaye, in the Vallée de Barcelone in Savoy;\r\nthe Veamini in Senez, the Triulatti at the village of Alloz, the Ecdini\r\nnear the river Tinea, and the Vergunni in the vicinity of the district\r\nof Vergons.\r\n\r\n[1954] The Eguituri probably dwelt near the modern town of Guillaumes,\r\nthe Oratelli at the place now called Le Puget de Théniers, and the\r\nVelauni near the modern Bueil.\r\n\r\n[1955] Or subjects of Cottius, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1956] A mistake for L. Æmilius Papus. He and C. Regulus were Consuls\r\nin B.C. 225. They successfully opposed the Cisalpine Gauls, who invaded\r\nItaly; but Regulus was slain in the engagement.\r\n\r\n[1957] It is difficult to say what is the exact force of “parci” here;\r\nwhether in fact it means that Italy shall be wholly exempted from such\r\ntreatment, as an indignity offered to her soil, or whether her minerals\r\nwere to be strictly kept in reserve as a last resource. Ajasson, in his\r\nTranslation, seems to take the former view, Littré the latter.\r\n\r\n[1958] From the river now called the Arsa to that called the Kerka.\r\n\r\n[1959] Hardouin thinks that “Ismeni” is the proper reading here; but\r\nall the MSS. seem to be against him.\r\n\r\n[1960] Mentioned in the next Chapter.\r\n\r\n[1961] Their town was Aluus or Aloüs.\r\n\r\n[1962] Their town was Flanona, which gave name to the Sinus Flanaticus\r\nor Golfo di Quarnero. The chief town of the Lopsi was Lopsica, and of\r\nthe Varvarini, Varvaria.\r\n\r\n[1963] The island of Fertina is supposed to have been the modern\r\nBerwitch or Parvich. Curicta is now called Karek or Veglia. The\r\nIllyrian snails mentioned by our author, B. ix. c. 56, are very\r\nnumerous here. Caius Antonius, the brother of Marcus, acting under\r\nJulius Cæsar, was besieged here by Libo. See the interesting account in\r\nLucan’s Pharsalia, B. iv. l. 402-464.\r\n\r\n[1964] The places on their sites are now called Albona, Fianona,\r\nTersact or Tersat near Fiume, Segna, Lopsico, Ortopia, and Veza.\r\n\r\n[1965] Now Carin. Ænona is now called Nona, and the Tedanius is the\r\nmodern Zermagna.\r\n\r\n[1966] The whole of this group of islands were sometimes called the\r\nAbsyrtides, from Absyrtus, the brother of Medea, who according to\r\ntradition was slain there. See the last Chapter, p. 266. Ovid, however,\r\nin his “Tristia,” states that, this took place at Tomi, on the Pontus\r\nEuxinus or Black Sea, the place of his banishment.\r\n\r\n[1967] Said by D’Anville to be now called Arbe, and Crexa to be the\r\nmodern Cherso. Gissa is thought to have been the modern Pago.\r\n\r\n[1968] It was the capital of Liburnia. The city of Zara or Zara Vecchia\r\nstands on its site. There are but little remains of the ancient city.\r\n\r\n[1969] Supposed to be the present Mortero.\r\n\r\n[1970] The Titus or Kerka. Scardona still retains its name.\r\n\r\n[1971] Now called the Cabo di San Nicolo.\r\n\r\n[1972] This measurement would make it appear that the present\r\nSabioncello is meant, but that it ought to come below, after Narona. He\r\nprobably means the quasi peninsula upon which the town of Tragurium,\r\nnow Trau Vecchio, was situate; but its circumference is hardly fifty\r\nmiles. So, if Sicum is the same as the modern Sebenico, it ought to\r\nhave been mentioned previously to Tragurium.\r\n\r\n[1973] Spalatro, the retreat of Diocletian, was in the vicinity of\r\nSalona. Its ancient name was Spolatum, and at the village of Dioclea\r\nnear it, that emperor was born. On the ruins of the once important city\r\nof Salona, rose the modern Spalato or Spalatro.\r\n\r\n[1974] Its site is unknown, though D’Anville thinks that it was\r\nprobably that of the modern Tain.\r\n\r\n[1975] Clissa is supposed to occupy its site. Tribulium is probably the\r\nmodern Ugliane.\r\n\r\n[1976] The people of the island of Issa, now Lissa, off the coast of\r\nLiburnia. It was originally peopled by a Parian or a Syracusan colony.\r\nIt was famous for its wine, and the beaked ships “Lembi Issaici,”\r\nrendered the Romans good service in the war with Philip of Macedon.\r\n\r\n[1977] The modern Almissa stands on its site; and on that of Rataneum,\r\nMucarisca.\r\n\r\n[1978] Now called Narenta; the river having the same name.\r\n\r\n[1979] The localities of all these peoples are unknown.\r\n\r\n[1980] Or Epidaurus. It is not noticed in history till the civil war\r\nbetween Pompey and Cæsar, when, having declared in favour of the\r\nlatter, it was besieged by M. Octavius. The site of it is known as\r\nRagusa Vecchia, or Old Ragusa, but in the Illyric language it is called\r\nZaptal. Upon its destruction, its inhabitants moved to Rausium, the\r\npresent Ragusa. There are no remains extant of the old town.\r\n\r\n[1981] It still retains the name of Risine, upon the Golfo di Cattaro,\r\nthe ancient Sinus Rhizonicus.\r\n\r\n[1982] In the former editions called “Ascrivium.” The modern Cattaro is\r\nsupposed to occupy its site. Butua is the modern Budua, and Olcinium,\r\nDulcigno. It is probable that the derivation of the name of this last\r\nplace, as suggested by Pliny, is only fanciful.\r\n\r\n[1983] Now called Drin and Drino.\r\n\r\n[1984] Now called Scutari or Scodar, the capital of the province called\r\nby the Turks Sangiac de Scodar.\r\n\r\n[1985] According to Hardouin, the modern Endero stands on the site of\r\ntheir capital.\r\n\r\n[1986] Grabia, mentioned by Pouqueville, in his “Voyage de la Grèce,”\r\nseems to retain the name of this tribe.\r\n\r\n[1987] Pouqueville is of opinion that they occupied the district now\r\nknown as Musaché.\r\n\r\n[1988] Dalechamp thinks that the two words “Retinet nomen” do not\r\nbelong to the text, but have crept in from being the gloss of some more\r\nrecent commentator. They certainly appear to be out of place. This\r\npromontory is now called Cabo Rodoni.\r\n\r\n[1989] The modern Albania.\r\n\r\n[1990] Pouqueville is of opinion that they inhabited the district about\r\nthe present village of Presa, seven leagues N.E. of Durazzo.\r\n\r\n[1991] From Ptolemy we learn that Lychnidus was their town; the site\r\nof which, according to Pouqueville, is still pointed out at a spot\r\nabout four leagues south of Ochrida, on the eastern bank of the Lake of\r\nOchrida.\r\n\r\n[1992] Now called El Bassan; though Pouqueville says Tomoros or\r\nDe Caulonias. Commencing in Epirus, they separated Illyricum from\r\nMacedonia. See Lucan’s Pharsalia, B. vi. l. 331.\r\n\r\n[1993] The Romans are said to have changed its Greek name Epidamnum,\r\nfrom an idea that it was inauspicious, as implying “damnum” or “ruin.”\r\nIt has been asserted that they gave it the name of Durrhachium or\r\nDyrrhachium, from “durum,” rugged, on account of the ruggedness of\r\nits locality. This however cannot be the case, as the word, like its\r\npredecessor, is of Greek origin. Its unfortunate name, “Epidamnus,” is\r\nthe subject of several puns and witticisms in that most amusing perhaps\r\nof all the plays of Plautus, the Menæchmi. It was of Corcyræan origin,\r\nand after playing a distinguished part in the civil wars between Pompey\r\nand Cæsar, was granted by Augustus to his veteran troops. The modern\r\nDurazzo stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[1994] Now called the Voioussa.\r\n\r\n[1995] The monastery of Pollina stands on its site. It was founded by\r\nthe Corinthians and Corcyræans. There are scarcely any vestiges of it\r\nremaining.\r\n\r\n[1996] See further mention of this spot in B. ii. c. 110.\r\n\r\n[1997] Pouqueville states that the ruins of Amantia are to be seen near\r\nthe village of Nivitza, on the right bank of the river Suchista. The\r\nremains of Bullis, the chief town of the Buliones, according to the\r\nsame traveller, are to be seen at a place called Gradista, four miles\r\nfrom the sea.\r\n\r\n[1998] The same writer states that Oricum was situate on the present\r\nGulf De la Vallona or d’Avlona, and that its port was the place now\r\ncalled by the Greeks Porto Raguseo, and by the Turks Liman Padisha.\r\n\r\n[1999] The “Heights of Thunder.” They were so called from the frequent\r\nthunderstorms with which they were visited. The range however was more\r\nproperly called the “Ceraunii Montes,” and the promontory terminating\r\nit “Acroceraunii” or “Acroceraunia,” meaning “the end of the Ceraunii.”\r\nThe range is now called the Mountains of Khimara, and the promontory,\r\nGlossa, or in Italian, Linguetta, meaning “the Tongue.”\r\n\r\n[2000] In C. 15 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2001] About 70 English miles is the distance.\r\n\r\n[2002] The Donau or Danube.\r\n\r\n[2003] Noricum corresponded to the greater part of the present Styria\r\nand Carinthia, and a part of Austria, Bavaria, and Salzburg.\r\n\r\n[2004] According to D’Anville the modern Wolk-Markt, on the river Drau\r\nor Drave. Celeia is the modern Cilley in Carniola. Teurnia, according\r\nto Mannert, is the Lurnfelde, near the small town of Spital.\r\n\r\n[2005] According to Mannert it was situate near the modern town of\r\nInnichen, near the sources of the Drave.\r\n\r\n[2006] Supposed to be the same as the Vindobona or Vindomona of other\r\nauthors, standing on the site of the modern city of Vienna.\r\n\r\n[2007] According to Cluver, it stood on the site of the modern Clausen\r\nin Bavaria.\r\n\r\n[2008] Mannert says that this place was the same with the modern\r\nSolfeld, near Klagenfurt.\r\n\r\n[2009] D’Anville and other writers think that this is the Neusiedler\r\nSee, not far from Vienna. Mannert, however, is of opinion that the name\r\nought to be written Pelso, and that the modern Balaton or Platten See\r\nis meant.\r\n\r\n[2010] The mountainous and woody tract in the vicinity of the Lake\r\nBalaton, on the confines of ancient Noricum and Pannonia.\r\n\r\n[2011] Now Sarvar on the river Raab, on the confines of Austria and\r\nHungary.\r\n\r\n[2012] According to Hardouin, the modern Sopron or Œdenburg.\r\n\r\n[2013] This province corresponded to the eastern part of Austria,\r\nStyria, Carinthia, Carniola, the whole of Hungary between the Danube\r\nand Saave, Slavonia, and part of Croatia and Bosnia. It was reduced by\r\nTiberius, acting under the orders of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[2014] Now Laybach, previously mentioned in c. 22. Sissia has been\r\nsucceeded by the modern Sissek on the Saave.\r\n\r\n[2015] The modern Draave or Drau.\r\n\r\n[2016] Now the Sau or Saave.\r\n\r\n[2017] According to Hardouin the Serretes and the Serrapilli inhabited\r\nthe modern Carinthia on both sides of the Draave. The sites of the\r\nother nations here mentioned are unknown.\r\n\r\n[2018] So called from the river Colapis. The other tribes are unknown.\r\n\r\n[2019] Probably the same as the mountain range near Warasdin on the\r\nDraave. The nations mentioned here dwelt on the western and eastern\r\nslopes of this range.\r\n\r\n[2020] Now known as Zagrabia.\r\n\r\n[2021] Now the Culpa.\r\n\r\n[2022] Dion Cassius, B. xix., says that the river Colapis or Colops\r\nflowed past the walls of the town of Siscia, but that Tiberius Cæsar\r\ncaused a trench to be dug round the town, and so drew the river round\r\nit, leading it back on the other side into its channel. He calls the\r\nisland Segetica.\r\n\r\n[2023] Now the Bossut. Sirmium occupied the site of the present Sirmich.\r\n\r\n[2024] The modern Tzeruinka, according to D’Anville and Brotier.\r\n\r\n[2025] Now the Walpo and the Sarroiez, according to Hardouin; or the\r\nBosna and the Verbas, according to Brotier and Mannert.\r\n\r\n[2026] Corresponding to the present Servia and Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n[2027] Of the Danube with the Saave or Savus just mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2028] Now the Morava, which runs through Servia into the Danube. The\r\nPingus is probably the Bek, which joins the Danube near Gradistic. The\r\nTimachus is the modern Timoch, and the Œscus is the Iscar in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n[2029] Now called the Vid, the Osma, and the Jantra, rising in the\r\nBalkan chain.\r\n\r\n[2030] Ajasson remarks here that the name of Illyricum was very\r\nvaguely used by the ancients, and that at different periods, different\r\ncountries were so designated. In Pliny’s time that region comprised\r\nthe country between the Arsia and the mouth of the Drilo, bounding it\r\non the side of Macedonia. It would thus comprehend a part of modern\r\nCarniola, with part of Croatia, Bosnia, Dalmatia, and Upper Albania. In\r\nlater times this name was extended to Noricum, Pannonia, Mœsia, Dacia,\r\nMacedonia, Thessalia, Achaia, Epirus, and even the Isle of Crete.\r\n\r\n[2031] Here meaning that part of the Mediterranean which lies between\r\nItaly and Greece south of the Adriatic. In more ancient times the\r\nAdriatic was included in the Ionian Sea, which was probably so called\r\nfrom the Ionian colonies which settled in Cephallenia and the other\r\nislands on the western coast of Greece.\r\n\r\n[2032] More properly “Diomedeæ,” being a group of small islands off\r\nthe coast of Apulia now called Isole di Tremiti, about eighteen miles\r\nfrom the mouth of the Fortore. They were so called from the fable that\r\nhere the companions of Diomedes were changed into birds. A species of\r\nsea-fowl (which Pliny mentions in B. x. c. 44) were said to be the\r\ndescendants of these Greek sailors, and to show a great partiality for\r\nsuch persons as were of kindred extraction. See Ovid’s Metamorphoses,\r\nB. xiv. l. 500. The real number of these islands was a matter of\r\ndispute with the ancients, but it seems that there are but three,\r\nand some mere rocks. The largest of the group is the island of San\r\nDomenico, and the others are San Nicola and Caprara. The small island\r\nof Pianosa, eleven miles N.E., is not considered one of the group, but\r\nis not improbably the Teutria of Pliny. San Domenico was the place of\r\nbanishment of Julia, the licentious daughter of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[2033] Now called the Bagni di Monte Falcone. See B. ii. c. 106.\r\n\r\n[2034] Now called Cherso and Osero, off the Illyrian coast. Ptolemy\r\nmentions only one, Apsorrus, on which he places a town of that name and\r\nanother called Crepsa. The Pullaria are now called Li Brioni, in the\r\nSinus Flanaticus, opposite the city of Pola.\r\n\r\n[2035] See p. 258.\r\n\r\n[2036] In B. xxxvii. c. 11, he again mentions this circumstance, and\r\nstates that some writers have placed them in the Adriatic opposite\r\nthe mouths of the Padus. Scymnus of Chios makes mention of them in\r\nconjunction with the Absyrtides. This confusion probably arose from\r\nthe fact previously noted that the more ancient writers had a confused\r\nidea that the Ister communicated with the Adriatic, at the same time\r\nmistaking it probably for the Vistula, which flows into the Baltic.\r\nAt the mouth of this last-mentioned river, there were Electrides or\r\n“amber-bearing” islands.\r\n\r\n[2037] “Vanitatis.”\r\n\r\n[2038] Crexa, Grissa, and Colentum, in c. 25.\r\n\r\n[2039] According to Brotier, these are situate between the islands of\r\nZuri and Sebenico, and are now called Kasvan, Capri, Smolan, Tihat,\r\nSestre, Parvich, Zlarin, &c. Some writers however suggest that there\r\nwere no islands called Celadussæ, and that the name in Pliny is a\r\ncorruption of Dyscelados in Pomponius Mela; which in its turn is\r\nsupposed to have been invented from what was really an epithet of Issa,\r\nin a line of Apollonius Rhodius, B. iv. l. 565. Ἰσσά τε δυσκέλαδος,\r\n“and inauspicious Issa.” See Brunck’s remarks on the passage.\r\n\r\n[2040] Now Brazza. According to Brotier the island is still celebrated\r\nfor the delicate flavour of the flesh of its goats and lambs. Issa is\r\nnow called Lissa, and Pharia is the modern Lesina. Baro, now Bua, lies\r\noff the coast of Dalmatia, and was used as a place of banishment under\r\nthe emperors.\r\n\r\n[2041] Now Curzola, or, in the Sclavonic, Karkar. It obtained its name\r\nof Nigra or Melæna, “black,” from the dark colour of its pine woods.\r\nSir G. Wilkinson describes it in his “Dalmatia and Montenegro,” vol. i.\r\n\r\n[2042] Now called Meleda or Zapuntello. It is more generally to the\r\nother island of Melita or Malta that the origin of the “Melitæi” or\r\nMaltese dogs is ascribed. Some writers are of opinion that it was upon\r\nthis island that St. Paul was shipwrecked, and not the larger Melita.\r\n\r\n[2043] So called from their resemblance to a stag, ἔλαφος, of which the\r\nmodern Giupan formed the head, Ruda the neck, Mezzo the body, Calamotta\r\nthe haunches, and the rock of Grebini or Pettini the tail. They produce\r\nexcellent wine and oil, and are looked upon as the most valuable part\r\nof the Ragusan territory.\r\n\r\n[2044] Still known as Sasino. It is ten miles from Ragusa, the port of\r\nOricum, according to Pouqueville.\r\n\r\n[2045] The original numbers are lost.\r\n\r\n[2046] He was a Spaniard by birth, a native of Mellaria in Hispania\r\nBætica. He is mentioned by Cicero as a man of great learning, and\r\nis probably the same person that is mentioned by Ovid in his Pontic\r\nEpistles, B. iv. ep. xvi. l. 29, as a distinguished tragic writer.\r\n\r\n[2047] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2048] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2049] M. Porcius Cato, or Cato the Elder; famous as a statesman, a\r\npatriot, and a philosopher. He wrote “De Re Rustica,” a work which\r\nstill survives, and “Letters of Instruction to his Son,” of which\r\nonly some fragments remain. He also wrote a historical work called\r\n“Origines,” of which Pliny makes considerable use. Of this also only a\r\nfew fragments are left. His life has been written by Cornelius Nepos,\r\nPlutarch, and Aurelius Victor.\r\n\r\n[2050] M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the distinguished partisan of Augustus,\r\nto whose niece Marcella he was married, but he afterwards divorced her\r\nfor Julia, the daughter of Augustus by Scribonia, and the widow of\r\nMarcellus. He distinguished himself in Gaul, at Actium, and in Illyria.\r\nHe constructed many public works at Rome, and among them the Pantheon;\r\nhe also built the splendid aqueduct at Nismes. He died suddenly in\r\nhis 51st year. His body was buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus, who\r\npronounced his funeral oration. He wrote memoirs of his own life. Pliny\r\noften refers to the “Commentarii” of Agrippa, by which are meant, it is\r\nsupposed, certain official lists drawn up by him in the measurement of\r\nthe Roman world under Augustus. His map of the world is also mentioned\r\nby Pliny in c. 3 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2051] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2052] From Servius, Suetonius and Plutarch we learn that Augustus\r\nwrote Memoirs of his Life, in thirteen books; from Suetonius, that he\r\ncomposed a Summary of the Empire (which was probably that referred to\r\nin the above note on Agrippa); and from Quintilian, Aulus Gellius,\r\nand Pliny, B. xviii. c. 38, that he published Letters written to his\r\ngrandson Caius.\r\n\r\n[2053] P. Terentius Varro, surnamed Atacinus, from the Atax, a river\r\nof Gallia Narbonensis, in which province he was born, B.C. 82. Of his\r\n“Argonautica,” his “Cosmographia” (probably the same with his “Iter”),\r\nhis “Navales Libri,” and his Heroic and Amatory Poems, only a few\r\nfragments now exist. Of his life nothing whatever is known.\r\n\r\n[2054] Valerias Antias. See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2055] C. Julius Hyginus, a native of Spain, and freedman of Augustus,\r\nby whom he was placed at the Palatine Library. He lived upon terms of\r\nintimacy with Ovid. He wrote works on the sites of the cities of Italy,\r\nthe Nature of the Gods, an account of the Penates, an account of Virgil\r\n(probably the same as the work called “Commentaries on Virgil”), on the\r\nFamilies of Trojan descent, on Agriculture, the “Propempticon Cinnæ,”\r\nthe Lives of Illustrious Men (quoted by John of Salisbury in his\r\n“Polycraticon”), a book of Examples, and a work on the Art of War, also\r\nmentioned by John of Salisbury. A book of Fables, and an Astronomical\r\nPoem, in four books, are ascribed to him, but they are probably\r\nproductions of a later age.\r\n\r\n[2056] L. Antistius Vetus, Consul with Nero, A.D. 55. While commanding\r\nin Germany he formed the project of connecting the Moselle and the\r\nSaone by a canal, thus establishing a communication between the\r\nMediterranean and the Northern Ocean. Nero having resolved on his\r\ndeath, he anticipated his sentence by opening his veins in a warm bath.\r\nHis mother-in-law Sextia, and his daughter Pollentia, in a similar\r\nmanner perished with him.\r\n\r\n[2057] He was born, it is supposed, at Tingentera, or Cingentera, on\r\nthe bay of Algesiras, and probably flourished in the reign of Claudius.\r\nHe was the first Roman author who wrote a treatise on Geography. It is\r\nstill extant, and bears marks of great care, while it is written in\r\npure and unaffected language.\r\n\r\n[2058] C. Scribonius Curio, the third known of that name. He was the\r\nfirst Roman general who advanced as far as the Danube. Like his son\r\nof the same name, he was a violent opponent of Julius Cæsar. He was\r\neloquent as an orator, but ignorant and uncultivated. His orations were\r\npublished, as also an invective against Cæsar, in form of a dialogue,\r\nin which his son was introduced as one of the interlocutors. He died\r\nB.C. 53.\r\n\r\n[2059] L. Cælius Antipater. See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2060] L. Arruntius, Consul, A.D. 6. Augustus declared in his last\r\nillness that he was worthy of the empire. This, with his riches and\r\ntalents, rendered him an object of suspicion to Tiberius. Being charged\r\nas an accomplice in the crimes of Albucilla, he put himself to death\r\nby opening his veins. It appears not to be certain whether it was this\r\nperson or his father who wrote a history of the first Punic war, in\r\nwhich he imitated the style of Sallust.\r\n\r\n[2061] Statius Sebosus. See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2062] Licinius Crassus Mucianus. See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2063] Of this writer no particulars whatever are known.\r\n\r\n[2064] In most editions this name appears as L. Ateius Capito, but\r\nSillig separates them, and with propriety it would appear, as the name\r\nof Capito the great legist was not Lucius. Ateius here mentioned was\r\nprobably the person surnamed Prætextatus, and Philologus, a freedman\r\nof the jurist Ateius Capito. For Sallust the historian he composed an\r\nAbstract of Roman History, and for Asinius Pollio he compiled precepts\r\non the Art of Writing. His Commentaries were numerous, but a few only\r\nwere surviving in the time of Suetonius.\r\n\r\n[2065] C. Ateius Capito, one of the most famous of the Roman legists,\r\nand a zealous partisan of Augustus, who had him elevated to the\r\nConsulship A.D. 5. He was the rival of Labeo, the republican jurist.\r\nHis legal works were very voluminous, and extracts from them are to be\r\nfound in the Digest. He also wrote a work on the Pontifical Rights and\r\nthe Law of Sacrifices.\r\n\r\n[2066] A distinguished grammarian of the latter part of the first\r\ncentury B.C. He was entrusted by Augustus with the education of his\r\ngrandsons Caius and Lucius Cæsar. He died at an advanced age in the\r\nreign of Tiberius. He wrote upon antiquities, history, and philosophy:\r\namong his numerous works a History of the Etruscans is mentioned, also\r\na treatise on Orthography. Pliny quotes him very frequently.\r\n\r\n[2067] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2068] He is mentioned in c. 17, but nothing more is known of him.\r\n\r\n[2069] Nothing is known of him. The younger Pliny addressed three\r\nEpistles to a person of this name, B. ii. Ep. 15, B. v. Ep. 4, 14.\r\n\r\n[2070] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2071] Also called by Pliny Cornelius Alexander. Suidas states that he\r\nwas a native of Ephesus and a disciple of Crates, and during the war of\r\nSylla in Greece was made prisoner and sold as a slave to C. Lentulus,\r\nwho made him the tutor of his children, and afterwards restored him\r\nto freedom. Servius however says that he received the franchise from\r\nL. Cornelius Sylla. He was burnt with his house at Laurentum. Other\r\nwriters say that he was a native of Catiæum in Lesser Phrygia. The\r\nsurname of “Polyhistor” was given to him for his prodigious learning.\r\nHis greatest work seems to have been a historical and geographical\r\naccount of the world, in forty-two books. Other works of his are\r\nfrequently mentioned by Plutarch, Photius, and other writers.\r\n\r\n[2072] The historian of the Peloponnesian war, and the most famous,\r\nperhaps, of all the ancient writers in prose.\r\n\r\n[2073] Of Eresus in Lesbos; the favourite disciple of Aristotle, and\r\ndesignated by him as his successor in the presidency of the Lyceum. He\r\ncomposed more than 200 works on various subjects, of which only a very\r\nfew survive.\r\n\r\n[2074] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2075] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2076] He is frequently mentioned by Cicero, and was famous for his\r\neloquence. Pliny informs us in his 34th book, that from his hatred of\r\nthe Romans he was called the “Roman-hater.” It is probable that he was\r\nthe writer of a Periegesis, or geographical work, from which Pliny\r\nseems to quote.\r\n\r\n[2077] No particulars of this author are known. He probably wrote on\r\ngeography.\r\n\r\n[2078] He is again mentioned by Pliny in B. iv. c. 13, and B. vi. c.\r\n31, and by Solinus, c. xxii. 60. It is supposed that he was the author\r\nof a Periplus or Circumnavigation of the Earth, mentioned by Pliny B.\r\nvii. c. 48; but nothing further is known of him.\r\n\r\n[2079] Diodorus Siculus was a native of Agyra or Agyrium, and not of\r\nSyracuse, though he may possibly have resided or studied there. It\r\ncannot be doubted that he is the person here meant, and Pliny refers in\r\nhis preface by name to his Βιβλιοθήκη, “Library,” or Universal History.\r\nA great portion of this miscellaneous but valuable work has perished.\r\nWe have but few particulars of his life; but he is supposed to have\r\nwritten his work after B.C. 8.\r\n\r\n[2080] Of Syracuse; an historian probably of the time of Philip and\r\nAlexander. He was the author of a Periplus of Asia, and an account of\r\nSicily and Sardinia. From his stories in the last he obtained the name\r\nof “Thaumatographus” or “writer of wonders.”\r\n\r\n[2081] Of Calliphanes the Geographer nothing is known.\r\n\r\n[2082] Probably Timagenes, the rhetorician of Alexandria. He was taken\r\nprisoner and brought to Rome, but redeemed from captivity by Faustus,\r\nthe son of Sylla. He wrote many works, but it is somewhat doubtful\r\nwhether the “Periplus,” in five Books, was written by this Timagenes.\r\nHe is also supposed to have written a work on the Antiquities of Gaul.\r\n\r\n[2083] Now called Monti della Chimera, or Mountains of Khimara. See p.\r\n262.\r\n\r\n[2084] The Ægean Sea, the present Archipelago.\r\n\r\n[2085] This country contained, according to Pouqueville, the present\r\nSangiacs of Janina, Delvino, and Chamouri, with the Vavodilika or\r\nPrincipality of Arta. This name was originally given to the whole of\r\nthe west of Greece, from the Promontory of Acroceraunia to the entrance\r\nof the Corinthian Gulf, in contradistinction to Corcyra and the island\r\nof Cephallenia.\r\n\r\n[2086] This district, according to Pouqueville, occupied the present\r\nCantons of Chimera, Iapouria, Arboria, Paracaloma, and Philates.\r\n\r\n[2087] They occupied the site of the present Paramythia, according to\r\nPouqueville.\r\n\r\n[2088] Antigonia was about a mile distant, Pouqueville says, from the\r\nmodern town of Tebelen.\r\n\r\n[2089] From Ἀ “not,” and ὄρνις “a bird.” Its site is now unknown. There\r\nwere many places of this name. Avernus or Aornos in Campania has been\r\npreviously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2090] The remains of Cestria are still to be seen at Palea Venetia,\r\nnear the town of Filiates. Pouqueville calls the place Chamouri.\r\n\r\n[2091] According to Pouqueville, the modern Zagori stands on the site\r\nof Perrhæbia. Pindus is sometimes called Grammos, but is still known by\r\nits ancient name.\r\n\r\n[2092] Cassiope or Cassope stood near the sea, and near the present\r\nvillage of Kamarina. Its extensive ruins are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[2093] Their district, according to Pouqueville, was in the present\r\nCanton of Drynopolis.\r\n\r\n[2094] The Selli or Sellæ lived in the vicinity of the temple of\r\nJupiter at Dodona, in the modern canton of Souli, according to\r\nPouqueville.\r\n\r\n[2095] The country about Dodona is called Hellopia by Hesiod. By some\r\nthe Helli or Hellopes are considered the same as the Selli. Pouqueville\r\nthinks that the Hellopes dwelt in the modern cantons of Janina,\r\nPogoniani, Sarachovitzas, and Courendas, and that the temple of Jupiter\r\nstood at the spot now called Proskynisis, near Gardiki, the town of\r\nDodona being near Castritza. Leake is of the same opinion as to the\r\nsite of the town; but, as has been a subject of remark, it is the only\r\nplace of celebrity in Greece of which the situation is not exactly\r\nknown. Leake however thinks that the temple stood on the peninsula now\r\noccupied by the citadel of Joanina.\r\n\r\n[2096] Pouqueville thinks that this is the hill to be seen at the\r\nmodern village of Gardiki. He is also of opinion that the springs\r\nhere mentioned are those at the modern village of Besdounopoulo. His\r\nopinions however on these points have not been implicitly received.\r\n\r\n[2097] B. iii. c. 26. The Dardani, Triballi, and Mœsi are mentioned in\r\nc. 29. The localities of the other tribes here mentioned are not known\r\nwith any exactness.\r\n\r\n[2098] It retains the same name or that of Khimara, and gives its name\r\nto the Acroceraunian range. It was situate at the foot of the chain,\r\nwhich begins at this spot.\r\n\r\n[2099] “Aquæ regiæ.” Pouqueville suggests, without good reason, as\r\nAnsart thinks, that this spring was situate near the modern Drimodez or\r\nDermadez.\r\n\r\n[2100] The place called Palæo-Kistes now stands on its site, and some\r\nremains of antiquity are to be seen.\r\n\r\n[2101] Now the Calama.\r\n\r\n[2102] Its ruins are to be seen near the modern Butrinto. It was said\r\nto have been founded by Helenus, the son of Priam. Pomponius Atticus\r\nhad an estate here.\r\n\r\n[2103] This corresponds to the present Gulf of Arta, and was especially\r\nfamous for being the scene of the battle of Actium. The city of\r\nAmbracia lay to the north of it. The present Arta is generally believed\r\nto occupy its site.\r\n\r\n[2104] Pouqueville has shown that Pliny is in error here, and he says\r\nthat the Acheron is the modern Mavro Potamos; but according to Leake,\r\nthe name of it is Gurla, or the river of Suli. It flows into the Port\r\nFanari, formerly called Glykys Limen, or Sweet Harbour, from the\r\nfreshness of the water there. The Acherusian Lake is probably the great\r\nmarsh that lies below Kastri.\r\n\r\n[2105] It is now called the Arta, and gives name to the Gulf.\r\n\r\n[2106] The site of Anactoria or Anactorium, like that of its neighbour\r\nActium, has been a subject of much dispute; but it is now pretty\r\ngenerally agreed that the former stood on the modern Cape Madonna, and\r\nActium on the headland of La Punta.\r\n\r\n[2107] Pouqueville takes the ruins in the vicinity of Turco Palaka,\r\neight miles from Margariti, to be those of Pandosia.\r\n\r\n[2108] This district probably occupied the present cantons of Vonitza\r\nand Xeromeros. It was called Curetis from the Curetes, who are said to\r\nhave come from Ætolia and settled in Acarnania after their expulsion by\r\nÆtolus and his followers.\r\n\r\n[2109] The modern Vonitza is supposed to stand on its site.\r\n\r\n[2110] Leake places its site at Ai Vasili, where some ruins are to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n[2111] “The city of Victory.” Founded by Augustus on the spot where he\r\nhad pitched his camp before the battle of Actium.\r\n\r\n[2112] Now called Capo Ducato or Capo tis Kiras. It is situate at the\r\nextremity of the island of Leucas, and opposite to Cephallenia. Sappho\r\nis said to have leapt from this rock on finding her love for Phaon\r\nunrequited: the story however is devoid of all historical truth.\r\n\r\n[2113] Now the island of Santa Maura. It was originally a peninsula,\r\nand Homer speaks of it as such; but the Corinthians cut a canal through\r\nthe isthmus and converted it into an island. After the canal had been\r\nchoked up for some time with sand, the Romans reopened it. It is at\r\npresent dry in some parts.\r\n\r\n[2114] Probably from its town Nericus, mentioned by Homer.\r\n\r\n[2115] From the Greek word διορυκτὸς, a “foss” or “trench.”\r\n\r\n[2116] It probably had this name from the circumstance of the\r\ninhabitants of Nericus being removed thither by the Corinthians under\r\nCypselus. The remains of Leucas, which was ravaged by the Romans B.C.\r\n197, are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[2117] Its remains are still to be seen in the valley of Kandili, south\r\nof Vonitza.\r\n\r\n[2118] Pouqueville says that very extensive and perfect ruins of this\r\nplace are to be seen near the village of Lepenou.\r\n\r\n[2119] This famous city was deserted on the foundation of Nicopolis by\r\nAugustus. The place of its site has been a subject of much dispute, but\r\nit is considered most probable that Leake has rightly suggested that\r\nthe ruins in the plain of Vlikha, at the village of Neokhori, are those\r\nof this city.\r\n\r\n[2120] Now the Aspropotamo.\r\n\r\n[2121] One of the group of the Echinades; small islands off the coast\r\nof Acarnania, which are mentioned by Pliny, in C. 19 of the present\r\nBook. It is now quite united to the mainland.\r\n\r\n[2122] Pouqueville says that Athamania occupied the localities now\r\nknown as Djoumerca and Radovitch. It properly belonged to Epirus, and\r\nPliny makes a mistake in considering it as a part of Ætolia.\r\n\r\n[2123] According to Pouqueville the ruins of Tymphæa are to be seen\r\nnear the village of Paliouri, four miles from Janina.\r\n\r\n[2124] Ephyre, a town of the Agræi, is also mentioned by Strabo, but\r\nnothing whatever is known of it.\r\n\r\n[2125] The main body of the Perrhæbi were a people of Thessaly.\r\n\r\n[2126] Dolopia, now called Anovlachia, was properly reckoned part of\r\nEpirus.\r\n\r\n[2127] They are probably not the same people as the inhabitants of\r\nAtrax in Thessaly, which will be found mentioned in the 15th Chapter of\r\nthis Book.\r\n\r\n[2128] The most famous city of Ætolia in its day, and the residence of\r\nŒneus, father of Meleager and Tydeus, and grandfather of Diomedes. The\r\ngreater part of its inhabitants were removed by Augustus to his new\r\ncity of Nicopolis. Leake supposes its ruins to be those seen by him at\r\nKurt-Aga, to the east of the river Evenus.\r\n\r\n[2129] Now called the Fidaris.\r\n\r\n[2130] Pouqueville supposes the site of Macynia to have been that of\r\nthe modern Koukio-Castron, and that of Molycria the present Manaloudi.\r\n\r\n[2131] Probably the present Varassova; there was a town called Chalcis,\r\nor Hypochalcis, at its foot. The present Kaki-Skala was probably the\r\nmountain of Taphiassus.\r\n\r\n[2132] Opposite the Promontory of Rhium, at the entrance of the\r\nCorinthian Gulf. It is now called the Castle of Roumelia, or the Punta\r\nof the Dardanelles of Roum Ili.\r\n\r\n[2133] Leake and Dodwell make it a mile and a half.\r\n\r\n[2134] Or Rhium. It is now called the Castle of the Morea.\r\n\r\n[2135] The modern Enebatché or Lepanto; whence the Corinthian Gulf\r\ntakes its modern name.\r\n\r\n[2136] Proschium was built at a later period on the site of Pylene. Its\r\nsite appears to be unknown. The modern Kyra-tis-Irinis is thought to\r\noccupy the site of Pleuron.\r\n\r\n[2137] Leake supposes some ruins between Kurt-aga, the site of\r\nChalcedon, and the east end of the Lagoon of Missolonghi, to be the\r\nremains of Halicyrna.\r\n\r\n[2138] Leake supposes it to be identical with the high mountain now\r\ncalled Kelberini. Others again identify it with Gribovo.\r\n\r\n[2139] Pliny erroneously places this mountain in Acarnania. It was a\r\nrange of Ætolia, now called Zygos.\r\n\r\n[2140] Perhaps the modern Djourmerca.\r\n\r\n[2141] Either the present Plocopari, or perhaps, more probably, Viena.\r\n\r\n[2142] A part of Mount Taphiassus. It is mentioned only by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2143] They are supposed to have inhabited the modern districts of\r\nMalandrino and Salone. They were called “Ozolæ” or ‘strong-smelling,’\r\neither from the undressed skins worn by them, or from the quantities of\r\nasphodel that grew in their country; or else from the vapours thrown\r\noff by the mineral springs in those parts.\r\n\r\n[2144] Pouqueville imagines its ruins to be those seen about two\r\nleagues from the modern Galaxidi.\r\n\r\n[2145] Lapie marks this in his map as the modern port of Ianakhi.\r\n\r\n[2146] So called from the ancient town of Crissa, which stood on it. It\r\nis the same as the modern Gulf of Salona.\r\n\r\n[2147] Or Eupalium. Leake supposes it to have stood in the plain of\r\nMarathia, opposite the islands of Trazonia, where some ruins still\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n[2148] Pausanias makes this town to be the same with the Homeric\r\nCrissa, but Strabo distinguishes the two places, and his opinion is now\r\ngenerally followed; Cirrha being thought to have been built at the head\r\nof the Crissæan gulf, as the port of Crissa. Its ruins are thought to\r\nbe those which bear the modern name of Magula.\r\n\r\n[2149] Or Chalæum. Pliny erroneously calls it a town of Phocis, it\r\nbeing on the coast of the Locri Ozolæ. He is wrong also in placing it\r\nseven miles from Delphi, and not improbably confounded it with Cirrha.\r\nLeake suggests that its site was the present Larnaki.\r\n\r\n[2150] The modern village of Kastri stands on part of the site of\r\nancient Delphi. Its ruins have been explored by Chandler, Leake, and\r\nUlrichs.\r\n\r\n[2151] The two highest summits of the range of Parnassus in the\r\nvicinity of Delphi were Tithorea, now Velitza, to the N.W., and\r\nLycorea, now Liakura, to the N.E. Its rocks above Delphi were called\r\nthe Phædriades or “Resplendent.”\r\n\r\n[2152] The famed Castalian spring is now called the Fountain of St.\r\nJohn, from the chapel of that saint which stands close to its source.\r\n\r\n[2153] Now the Mavro-Potamo.\r\n\r\n[2154] Its ruins are still to be seen about three leagues from Kastri.\r\n\r\n[2155] Or Crisso. It was situate inland to the S.W. of Delphi. Its\r\nruins are to be seen at a short distance from the modern village of\r\nChryso.\r\n\r\n[2156] It is supposed that the few ruins seen near the modern Aspra\r\nSpitia are those of this place. It was famous for its hellebore, which\r\nwas extensively used for the cure of madness. There were two other\r\nplaces of the same name.\r\n\r\n[2157] The people of Bulis, near the Crissæan Gulf. Its ruins are\r\nsituate at a short distance from the monastery of Dobé.\r\n\r\n[2158] Ansart suggests that this was the present port of Agio-Sideri or\r\nDjesphina.\r\n\r\n[2159] It occupied the site of the modern Salona; the walls of its\r\nancient Acropolis are still to be seen. It was the chief town of the\r\nLocri Ozolæ.\r\n\r\n[2160] Pouqueville thinks that the ruins seen near Moulki are those of\r\nTithrone, and that Tritea stood on the site of the present Turcochorion.\r\n\r\n[2161] Or Amphrysus, famous for the strength of its fortifications and\r\nits scarlet berries for dyeing. Some remains of it are to be seen at\r\nthe modern village of Dhistomo.\r\n\r\n[2162] On the frontiers of Doris and Phocis. Leake thinks that its\r\nruins are those seen midway between Kamares and Glamista. Daulis was\r\nalso the name of an ancient town of Phocis, the ruins of which are to\r\nbe seen at the modern village of Dhavlia.\r\n\r\n[2163] Probably the present Palæo Kastro, at the Port de Dobrena or\r\nPolaca.\r\n\r\n[2164] Leake thinks that the Corsian Thebes, a port of Bœotia, is\r\nrepresented by the modern Khosia.\r\n\r\n[2165] Helicon is a range of mountains with several summits, the\r\nloftiest of which is now called Paleovuni. Helicon was a grove of the\r\nMuses, and the fountain of Aganippe was supposed to impart poetic\r\ninspiration to those who drank of it.\r\n\r\n[2166] See p. 288.\r\n\r\n[2167] From Apis, the son of Phoroneus, or Telchines, according to\r\nPausanias. After the arrival of Pelops, it took from him its name of\r\nPeloponnesus, or the “Island of Pelops.”\r\n\r\n[2168] The Ionian from the north, and the Ægean, or rather, Myrtoan,\r\nSea from the east.\r\n\r\n[2169] That part of Greece proper which lies to the north of the\r\nIsthmus.\r\n\r\n[2170] Now the Gulfs of Lepanto and Egina.\r\n\r\n[2171] Lecheæ was the harbour of Corinth on the Corinthian, and\r\nCenchreæ on the Saronic Gulf. The name of the latter is still preserved\r\nin the modern appellation Kechries, which is given to its ruins.\r\n\r\n[2172] Demetrius Poliorcetes, king of Macedonia, son of Antigonus, king\r\nof Asia.\r\n\r\n[2173] Caius Caligula, the Emperor.\r\n\r\n[2174] The Emperor Nero actually commenced the work, having opened\r\nthe undertaking with great pomp, and cut away a portion of the earth\r\nwith his own hands. He had advanced four stadia, when the work was\r\ninterrupted by the insurrection of Julius Vindex in Gaul.\r\n\r\n[2175] We cannot agree with Hardouin that “exitus” here means “death,”\r\nin allusion to the unfortunate end of all those who had made the\r\nattempt. The opinion of Spanheim seems rather deserving of support\r\n(though censured by Hardouin), that it merely means “the result”\r\nin each case; it being the fact, that in all the instances the\r\ncontemplated undertaking was interrupted by some unforeseen event.\r\nPeriander and Herodes Atticus also contemplated the formation of this\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\n[2176] It is not known when it exchanged this name for that of Corinth;\r\nbeing called by both names in Homer. Scarcely any remains of it are now\r\nto be seen. The small town on its site is called Gortho, a corruption\r\nof its ancient name. The water of the famed spring of Pirene is now\r\nonly used for washing clothes.\r\n\r\n[2177] Now Patras. There are few remains of the ancient city, which\r\nwas one of the twelve cities of Achaia. It was made a Roman colony by\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\n[2178] See C. 3 of the present Book, p. 275.\r\n\r\n[2179] Originally a district in the south of Thessaly had this name;\r\nbut to distinguish it from that in the Peloponnesus, its people were\r\ncalled the Phthiotian Achæi.\r\n\r\n[2180] From the Greek word αἰγιαλὸς, “the sea-shore.”\r\n\r\n[2181] Situate on the coast, about five miles from the present Vostitza.\r\n\r\n[2182] In the interior. The modern Trikala stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[2183] Helice was the place of meeting of the Achæan league; when, in\r\nB.C. 373, together with Bura, it was swallowed up by an earthquake,\r\nand their sites were covered by the sea. Such of the people as escaped\r\nfled to the places mentioned above by Pliny. Pouqueville says that some\r\nremains of these places may still be seen emerging from the sea.\r\n\r\n[2184] The modern Basilico or Vasilika stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[2185] The places called Palæo-Kastro and Vostitza are supposed\r\nto occupy the sites of Ægira and Ægium. To the east of Vostitza\r\nconsiderable ruins are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[2186] Supposed to be the present Artotina.\r\n\r\n[2187] Towns of Roman Argolis. The ruins of the former are supposed to\r\nbe those at a spot still called Klenes, near the village of Curtesi.\r\nThe remains of Hysiæ, on the road from Argos to Tegea, stand on a hill\r\nabove the plain of Achladokampos.\r\n\r\n[2188] Now called Tekieh; fifteen stadia from Rhium.\r\n\r\n[2189] Or Pharæ; 150 stadia from Patræ.\r\n\r\n[2190] The modern Kato-Achaia.\r\n\r\n[2191] Its remains are to be seen near the modern village of\r\nKaravostasi. Pliny is mistaken probably in calling it a colony, as we\r\nknow that it was placed under the authority of the colony of Patræ,\r\nwhich alone was allowed to enjoy the privilege of self-government.\r\n\r\n[2192] Pouqueville thinks that it was situate on the river now called\r\nthe Verga. Leake supposes that the town of Hyrmine stood on the site of\r\nthe present Kastro Tornese on the peninsula of Khlemutzi; but Boblaye\r\nand Curtius place it further north, at the modern harbour of Kunupeli,\r\nwhere there are some ancient ruins.\r\n\r\n[2193] Now Capo Papa.\r\n\r\n[2194] The locality of Cyllene is doubtful. Most writers place it at\r\nGlarentza but Pouqueville suggests Andravida or Andravilla, and Mannert\r\nplaces it near Clarenza. Chelinates or Chelonatas was probably the name\r\noriginally of the whole peninsula of Khlemutzi, but the point here\r\nmentioned was most probably the modern Cape Tornese.\r\n\r\n[2195] It lay in the interior, south of Sicyonia, and north of Argos.\r\nPouqueville found its ruins on the banks of the Asopus.\r\n\r\n[2196] Strabo says that this was the name of the most ancient town of\r\nPhliasia, and that the inhabitants afterwards deserted it for Phlius.\r\n\r\n[2197] Some small ruins of it are to be seen at the foot of the hill of\r\nKaloskopi, its ancient Acropolis.\r\n\r\n[2198] By Olympiads, which were reckoned according to the order of\r\ncelebration of the Olympic games: they were established in the year\r\nB.C. 776, and were celebrated every fourth year.\r\n\r\n[2199] It was destroyed in the year B.C. 572 by the Eleans, not a\r\nvestige of it being left. The Alpheus retains the name of Alfio.\r\n\r\n[2200] Or “the Fish,” from its peculiar shape. It is now called\r\nKatakolo.\r\n\r\n[2201] Probably situate in the valley between Elis and Messenia, which\r\nwas so called. It is not elsewhere mentioned; and its ruins are thought\r\nto be those near the sea, on the right bank of the river Cyparissus.\r\nLeprion is again mentioned in c. x.\r\n\r\n[2202] Or Platamodes. Supposed to be the present Aja Kyriaki.\r\n\r\n[2203] This city survived through the middle ages, when it was called\r\nArkadia. In 1525 it was destroyed by the Turks, and when rebuilt\r\nresumed nearly its ancient name as Cyparissia, by which it is now\r\ncalled. The bay or gulf is called the Gulf of Arkadia.\r\n\r\n[2204] Messenian Pylos probably stood on the site of the modern Erana;\r\nPouqueville says however that it is still called Pilo, and other\r\nwriters place it at Zonchio. It stood on the modern Bay of Navarino.\r\n\r\n[2205] Its site was at the spot called Palæo Kastro, near the modern\r\ntown of Modon. The site of Messenian Helos, so called from its position\r\nin the marshes, τὸ ἕλος, is now unknown.\r\n\r\n[2206] Now Capo Gallo.\r\n\r\n[2207] It stood on the western side of the Messenian Gulf, which\r\nfrom it was called the Asinæan Gulf. Grisso, or, according to some,\r\nIaratcha, occupies its site. Koroni however is most probably the spot\r\nwhere it stood, the inhabitants of ancient Corone having removed to\r\nit. Petalidhi stands on the site of Corone. A small portion of the\r\nMessenian Gulf was probably called the Coronean.\r\n\r\n[2208] Now Cape Matapan.\r\n\r\n[2209] Now the Pyrnatza.\r\n\r\n[2210] Its ruins, which are extensive, are to be seen in the vicinity\r\nof the modern village of Mavromati. Ithome was the citadel of Messene,\r\non a mountain of the same name, now called Vourcano.\r\n\r\n[2211] It is supposed that in ancient times it occupied the site of the\r\nmore modern Samos or Samia in Triphylia. The modern Sareni is thought\r\nto occupy its site.\r\n\r\n[2212] Dorion or Dorium, the spot where, according to Homer, the Muses\r\npunished Thamyris with blindness, is supposed to have been situate on\r\nthe modern plain of Sulima.\r\n\r\n[2213] Nothing seems to be known of this place; but it is not\r\nimprobable that it gave its name to the place so called in Sicily,\r\noriginally a Messenian colony.\r\n\r\n[2214] Or Tænarus, afterwards called Cænopolis. The present town of\r\nKisternes, or Kimaros, occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[2215] Its site is generally placed at Sklavokhori, six miles from\r\nSparta; but Leake supposes it to have been situate on the hill called\r\nAghia Kyriaki, between that place and Sparta.\r\n\r\n[2216] Or Pharis. The present Chitries occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[2217] Or Leuctrum, on the river Pamisus, now called Levtros. It must\r\nnot be confounded with the town in Bœotia where the Thebans defeated\r\nthe Spartans, B.C. 371.\r\n\r\n[2218] Or Lacedæmon. Its site is occupied by the modern villages of\r\nMagula and Psykhiko. The principal modern town in the vicinity is\r\nMistra.\r\n\r\n[2219] Or Therapnæ, on the left bank of the Eurotas. Some ruins of it\r\nare still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[2220] Considerable ruins of it are still to be seen to the N.E. of the\r\nmodern town of Skarhamula.\r\n\r\n[2221] Authors are not agreed as to the site of this town and that of\r\nAnthea or Anthene.\r\n\r\n[2222] Memorable for the pitched battle between 300 Argives and 300\r\nSpartans,—Othryades being the sole survivor of the Spartans, and\r\nAlcenor and Chromius of the Argives.\r\n\r\n[2223] By Homer called Enope.\r\n\r\n[2224] Pente Dactylon, or Pente Dactyli, the “Five Fingers,” is the\r\npresent name of the range of Taygetus. Its principal summits are now\r\nSt. Elias and Paixamadhi. The river Eurotas is now called Iris and\r\nNiris in its upper and middle course, and Basili-potamo from the\r\nSpartan plain to the sea.\r\n\r\n[2225] Ægila, according to Leake, occupied the site of the present\r\nScutari; if so, this gulf was probably the Gulf of Scutari. Psamathus\r\nwas near the point of Tænarum.\r\n\r\n[2226] Or Gythium, near the mouth of the Eurotas. It was famous for\r\nits cheeses. The ruins are called Paleopoli, a little to the north of\r\nMarathonisi.\r\n\r\n[2227] Now Capo Santo Angelo.\r\n\r\n[2228] Now Capo Skillo.\r\n\r\n[2229] Or Bœæ. Its ruins are to be seen at the head of the Gulf of\r\nVatika.\r\n\r\n[2230] It stood on the site of the place called Palæ-Emvasia, above\r\nMonembasia.\r\n\r\n[2231] Its site is the modern Porto Kari, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[2232] Leake places Cyphanta either at Cyparissi, or farther north, at\r\nLenidhi. Ansart makes it the modern Porto Botte, or Stilo.\r\n\r\n[2233] Now the Banitza. The Erasinus is the modern Kephalari.\r\n\r\n[2234] So called from its breed of horses. It is now also called Argos;\r\nthree leagues from Napoli di Romania.\r\n\r\n[2235] Its site is now called Milos. In the marshes in its vicinity\r\nHercules was said to have killed the Lernæan Hydra.\r\n\r\n[2236] Karvata is the name of the place on its site. Its ruins are\r\nnumerous, and of great magnificence.\r\n\r\n[2237] Its ruins are of the most interesting nature, presenting\r\nenormous masses of stone, of Cyclopian architecture. The spot is at the\r\npresent day called Palæ-Nauplia.\r\n\r\n[2238] It must not be confounded with the place in Arcadia, where\r\nEpaminondas fell. Its site appears to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[2239] Or Apesas, in the territory of Cleonæ, now called Fuka. Artemius\r\nis probably the present Malvouni, or Malcyo.\r\n\r\n[2240] A river of the same name rose in this mountain; its identity is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n[2241] So called from Niobe, the sister of Pelops and wife of Amphion,\r\nking of Thebes. The spring of Amymone ran into the lake of Lerna.\r\n\r\n[2242] Its ruins are to be seen in the vicinity of the modern village\r\nof Castri: they are very extensive.\r\n\r\n[2243] The modern Dhamala occupies the site of Trœzen.\r\n\r\n[2244] The identity of this Coryphasium seems to be unascertained.\r\nThere was a promontory of that name in Messenia; but it cannot be the\r\nplace here spoken of.\r\n\r\n[2245] It is supposed that Pliny here alludes to Argos Hippium, which\r\nhe has previously mentioned; but only in connection with the rivers\r\nInachus and Erasinus, and not as included in the list of the towns of\r\nArgolis. The origin of the term “Dipsian” is probably unknown. It could\r\nhardly allude to drought, as Argos was abundantly supplied with water.\r\nBut see B. vii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[2246] Ansart says that this is the modern Porto Estremo, at the mouth\r\nof the Saronic Gulf.\r\n\r\n[2247] Hesychius says that oaks were called σαρωνιδὲς in the language\r\nof ancient Greece. This gulf is now called the Gulf of Egina, or of\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\n[2248] He was worshipped here under the form of a serpent; and his\r\ntemple, five miles from Epidaurus, was resorted to by patients from\r\nall parts of Greece for the cure of their diseases. The ruins of this\r\ntemple are still to be seen, and those of the theatre at Epidaurus are\r\nvery extensive. The village of Pidharvo stands in the midst of the\r\nruins.\r\n\r\n[2249] The modern Capo Franco.\r\n\r\n[2250] Lapie takes Anthedus, or Anthedon, to be the place now called\r\nPorto d’Athene.\r\n\r\n[2251] This appears to have been a port of Corinth, on a promontory\r\nof the same name, meaning, probably from its shape, the “Bull’s Head\r\nPoint.”\r\n\r\n[2252] Called the ‘Posideium’; in its vicinity the games were\r\ncelebrated. The Isthmian Sanctuary was especially famous as a place of\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\n[2253] From δρυμωδὴς, “woody,” it being filled with groves and forests.\r\n\r\n[2254] Now called the Khan of Tripotamo.\r\n\r\n[2255] Now called Paleopoli. Here Epaminondas fell, fighting against\r\nthe Spartans, B.C. 362.\r\n\r\n[2256] In the N.E. of Arcadia. Its ruins are supposed to be those seen\r\nnear the modern Chionia. It was in the vicinity of the lake of the same\r\nname, the scene of one of the labours of Hercules.\r\n\r\n[2257] An important city: the modern Piali marks its site.\r\n\r\n[2258] Built upon the ruins of the ancient Mantinea.\r\n\r\n[2259] An ancient town mentioned by Homer, N.W. of Mantinea. The modern\r\nKalpaki stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[2260] Or Pheneus, on the N.W. of Arcadia. Phonia stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[2261] Near Tegea; said to have been the birth-place of Evander. On the\r\nfoundation of Megalopolis, it was nearly deserted, but was restored by\r\nAntoninus Pius. Its ruins are supposed to be those seen near the modern\r\nvillage of Thana, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[2262] It being said to have been so called in compliment to Evander, a\r\nnative, as above stated, of Palantium.\r\n\r\n[2263] Founded by the advice of Epaminondas, after the battle of\r\nLeuctra, B.C. 371, near the frontiers of Messenia. The ruins of its\r\ntheatre, once the largest in Greece, are the only remains of it now to\r\nbe seen, near the modern village of Sinano.\r\n\r\n[2264] It contained a famous temple of Æsculapius. Its ruins are to be\r\nseen near the village of Atzikolo. The exact site of Bucolion, which\r\nwas near Megalopolis, is probably unknown, though Ansart says that the\r\nspot is called Troupiais. Of Carnion nothing is known.\r\n\r\n[2265] The town of Parrhasia, which is mentioned by Homer, seems to\r\nhave given name to the Parrhasian district. Leake thinks it to be the\r\nsame as Lycosura.\r\n\r\n[2266] On the river Ladon: its ruins are seen near the modern Vanena.\r\n\r\n[2267] In the west of Arcadia, on the river Alpheus.\r\n\r\n[2268] Or “Juno’s Town.” It was a place of great importance, situate\r\non the lower Alpheus. Its remains are to be seen on a hill west of the\r\nvillage of Aianni, or St. John. They are very inconsiderable. Its wine\r\nwas highly esteemed, and still maintains its ancient celebrity.\r\n\r\n[2269] Of Pylæ, Pallene, Agræ, and Epium, nothing appears to be known.\r\n\r\n[2270] Or Cynætha, in the north of Arcadia, upon the Aroanian\r\nmountains, beyond the natural boundaries of Arcadia. The modern village\r\nof Kalavryta occupies its site; but there are scarcely any traces of\r\nits remains.\r\n\r\n[2271] Or Lepreum, so called to distinguish it from Lepreum in Elis.\r\n\r\n[2272] Nothing seems to be known of this Parthenium. Alea lay between\r\nOrchomenus and Stymphalus. Its ruins have been discovered in the dark\r\nvalley of Skotini, a mile to the N.E. of the village of Buyati.\r\n\r\n[2273] Its site has the modern name of Palæopyrgos. The sites of\r\nEnispe, mentioned by Homer, and Macistum, are unknown.\r\n\r\n[2274] Or Cleitor, a famous town of Arcadia. Its ruins are to be seen\r\non the plain of Kalzana, or Katzanes. One of the rivulets that ran past\r\nit still retains the name of Clitora.\r\n\r\n[2275] Its ruins, few in number, but testifying its importance, are\r\nfound near the modern village of Kleves, not far from Kurtesi. The\r\nNemean games were celebrated in honour of Hercules in the grove of\r\nNemea, between Cleonæ and Phlius.\r\n\r\n[2276] From the village of Bembina there, mentioned by Strabo, and on\r\nwhich Koutzomati probably now stands.\r\n\r\n[2277] Now called Olono. It received its name from the Centaur Pholus,\r\naccidentally slain by one of the poisoned arrows of Hercules.\r\n\r\n[2278] The modern Zyria.\r\n\r\n[2279] Nomiai and Hellenitza are modern names given to this mountain.\r\n\r\n[2280] In the south of Arcadia. It is now called Roïnon.\r\n\r\n[2281] Or Artemisium, forming the boundary between Argolis and Arcadia.\r\nIt is now called Turniki.\r\n\r\n[2282] The pass by this mountain from Argolis to Tegea is still called\r\nPartheni.\r\n\r\n[2283] Now called Zembi, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[2284] The town of Nonacris stood at its foot. The river Styx took its\r\nrise in these mountains.\r\n\r\n[2285] Now called the Landona.\r\n\r\n[2286] The town now called Fonia, already mentioned by Pliny. The\r\nwaters of its marshes were discharged by a subterranean passage, said\r\nto have been made by Hercules.\r\n\r\n[2287] Now called the Dogana. The two principal heights of Mount\r\nErymanthus are Olonos and Kalefoni.\r\n\r\n[2288] The people of Aliphira, a town of Arcadia, in the district of\r\nCynura. Considerable remains of it are still to be seen on the hill of\r\nNerovitza.\r\n\r\n[2289] The people of Abea, in Messenia.\r\n\r\n[2290] The people of Pyrgos, in Arcadia.\r\n\r\n[2291] The people of Paroræa, in Arcadia. Of the two next, nothing\r\nappears to be known.\r\n\r\n[2292] The inhabitants of Typaneæ, in Elis.\r\n\r\n[2293] The people of Thrius, in Elis, near Patræ.\r\n\r\n[2294] The people of Tritia, in Achaia, now Chalanthistra.\r\n\r\n[2295] Nero abolished the institutions of the Roman province of\r\nAchaia, which had been assigned to the Roman senate, and governed\r\nby a proconsul, granting it its liberty. Vespasian, however, again\r\nestablished the provincial government, and compelled the Greeks to pay\r\na yearly tribute.\r\n\r\n[2296] Now Vostitza.\r\n\r\n[2297] See p. 281.\r\n\r\n[2298] From the Greek ἀκτὴ, “the sea-shore.”\r\n\r\n[2299] It still retains its ancient name.\r\n\r\n[2300] Or Pegæ. It lay on the borders of the Corinthian Gulf, being,\r\nas Pliny says, the utmost point of the Peloponnesus on that side, as\r\nMegara was on the Saronic Gulf. According to Kruse, Psato occupies its\r\nsite, but according to Lapie, Alepochori. The former is most probably\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n[2301] On the Corinthian Gulf. Porto Ghermano occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[2302] On the Saronic Gulf, to the north of Cenchreæ. The present Porto\r\nCocosi occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[2303] Now Leandra, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[2304] Or Crommyon. It was the chief place on the Saronic Gulf, between\r\nthe Isthmus, properly so called, and Megara. Its ruins are thought to\r\nbe those seen near the chapel of Saint Theodorus. It was said to have\r\nbeen the haunt of the wild boar killed by Theseus.\r\n\r\n[2305] So called from being the scene of the ravages of the robber\r\nSciron. They are now called Kaki Scala.\r\n\r\n[2306] Famous as the principal seat of the worship of the goddesses\r\nDemeter and Persephone. Its remains are to be seen at the modern\r\nLefsina.\r\n\r\n[2307] Pera Chora marks its site. It was a member of the Tetrapolis of\r\nAttica, and Probalinthos another.\r\n\r\n[2308] Ulrichs, the best authority, places the port of Phalerum at the\r\neast corner of the great Phaleric Bay, in the vicinity of Tripirghi,\r\nor the Three Towers. The three harbours of the Piræus are the present\r\nPhanari, Stratiotiki or Paschalimani, and Drako or Porto Leone.\r\n\r\n[2309] The Piræus was united to the city by two walls, called the “Long\r\nWalls,” forty stadia in length. The length of the Phaleric wall was\r\nthirty-five stadia.\r\n\r\n[2310] It is to be regretted that such was his opinion. He could have\r\nwell spared space for a description of it.\r\n\r\n[2311] The city of Cephisia, still called Kivisia, was one of the\r\ntwelve cities of Cecrops. The fountain of transparent water is still to\r\nbe seen here.\r\n\r\n[2312] Or the “Nine Springs.” It was the only source of good water for\r\ndrinking purposes in Athens. This spring is still called by its ancient\r\nname. Of Larine nothing seems to be known.\r\n\r\n[2313] This is thought to have been the ancient name of the mountain\r\nafterwards known as Pentelicus, so famous for its marble, now called\r\nMendeli or Penteli.\r\n\r\n[2314] The northern or Greater Hymettus is now called Telo-Vuni, the\r\nsouthern or Lesser Mavro-Vuni.\r\n\r\n[2315] On the N.E. of Athens, now called the Hill of Saint George.\r\n\r\n[2316] Probably on the river of the same name.\r\n\r\n[2317] Now Capo Colonna.\r\n\r\n[2318] North of Sunium and the modern bay of Panorimo. Thoricus was one\r\nof the Demi of Attica.\r\n\r\n[2319] This was the name of two Demi, though probably one place. It lay\r\non the east coast to the north of Thoricus. Its harbour was probably\r\nthe modern Dhaskalio; and the town is placed by Leake at the ruins\r\ncalled Paleokastro, to the south of the village of Dardheza.\r\n\r\n[2320] On the east coast, between Prasiæ and Brauron.\r\n\r\n[2321] One of the twelve ancient cities of Cecrops, on the eastern\r\ncoast. Its name is supposed to be preserved in those of the villages\r\nVraona and Paleo Vraona.\r\n\r\n[2322] A Demus belonging to the tribe Æantis. It was famous for its\r\ntemple of Nemesis, the goddess of retribution. The present Obrio Castro\r\noccupies its site.\r\n\r\n[2323] Memorable for the defeat of the Persians by the Athenians, B.C.\r\n490. The site of the ancient town of Marathon is thought not to have\r\nbeen at the modern village of Marathon, but a place called Vrana, to\r\nthe south of it.\r\n\r\n[2324] The eastern part of the Eleusinian plain was thus called, from\r\nthe Demus of Thria. Its exact site is uncertain.\r\n\r\n[2325] Melite was a Demus of the tribe Cecropis, of Athens, west of the\r\nInner Ceramicus.\r\n\r\n[2326] Now Oropo, on the eastern frontiers of Bœotia and Attica, near\r\nthe Euripus. It originally belonged to the Bœotians.\r\n\r\n[2327] Its ruins are supposed to be those seen eight miles from Egripo.\r\nLukisi has also been suggested.\r\n\r\n[2328] Its ruins are still to be seen on the S.W. slope of Mount Faga.\r\n\r\n[2329] On the S.E. slope of Mount Helicon. Its ruins are to be seen at\r\nthe modern Eremo or Rimokastro.\r\n\r\n[2330] Now Livadhia. The celebrated cave of Trophonius stood in its\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\n[2331] Extensive remains of it are still to be seen; but the modern\r\ntown of Theba or Stiva stands only on the site of its ancient Cadmea or\r\ncitadel.\r\n\r\n[2332] To distinguish it from places of the same name in Egypt,\r\nPhthiotis, and Lucania.\r\n\r\n[2333] On the range of mountains of that name separating Bœotia from\r\nMegaris and Attica. The forest abounded in game, and the vicinity was a\r\nfavourite scene of the poetic legends. Paleovuni is the highest summit\r\nof the Heliconian range. Leake fixes the Grove of the Muses at the\r\npresent church of Saint Nicholas, at the foot of Mount Marandali, one\r\nof the summits of Helicon.\r\n\r\n[2334] These fountains or springs are very difficult to identify,\r\nbut Hippocrene, or the “Horse-Spring” (said to have been produced by\r\nPegasus striking the ground with his feet), was probably at the present\r\nMakariotissa; while Aganippe is the fountain that flows midway between\r\nPaleo-panaghia and Pyrgaki.\r\n\r\n[2335] This place was originally a member of the Bœotian confederacy,\r\nbut joined the Athenians, though it did not become an Attic Demus.\r\nLeake thinks that its ruins are those seen at Myupoli. Ross thinks\r\nthat it stood to the east of Ghyfto-kastro, while other writers are\r\nof opinion that it stood more to the west, near the modern village of\r\nKundara.\r\n\r\n[2336] Razed to the ground by the Roman prætor Lucretius, for having\r\nespoused the cause of king Perseus. Its remains are seen about a mile\r\nfrom the village of Mazi, on the road from Thebes to Lebadæa.\r\n\r\n[2337] Memorable for the defeat of the Persians under Mardonius, B.C.\r\n479.\r\n\r\n[2338] Distant twenty stadia from Orchomenus. Leake places it at the\r\nmodern Izamali, Forchhammer at Avro-Kastro.\r\n\r\n[2339] Its site is uncertain. Leake supposes it to be at Paleokastro,\r\nbetween the north end of Lake Hylica and the foot of Mount Palea.\r\nUlrichs places it at the south end of the lake.\r\n\r\n[2340] The modern Kakosia occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[2341] At the foot of Mount Cithæron. Leake places it eastward of\r\nKatzula, at the foot of the rocks there.\r\n\r\n[2342] Leake identifies it with the ruins on the torrent of Plataniki,\r\nbelow the mountain of Siamata. Pausanias says it was situate seven\r\nstadia beyond Teumessus, and at the foot of Hypatus, now Siamata.\r\n\r\n[2343] On Lake Copaïs. The modern village of Topolia occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[2344] The waters of the Cephisus here burst forth from their\r\nsubterraneous channel.\r\n\r\n[2345] On Lake Copaïs. Its ruins are at a short distance to the south\r\nof the modern Kardhitza.\r\n\r\n[2346] South of Mount Helicon. Its principal remains are those of its\r\ntheatre, a temple of Hera, and the agora or market-place.\r\n\r\n[2347] On the borders of Phocis; famous for the battles fought in its\r\nvicinity between the Athenians and Bœotians, B.C. 447, and between\r\nPhilip of Macedon and the Athenians and Bœotians, B.C. 338, and that in\r\nwhich Sylla defeated the generals of Mithridates B.C. 86. It stood on\r\nthe site of the modern village of Kapurna.\r\n\r\n[2348] On the river Copaïs, at the foot of Mount Tilphusion.\r\n\r\n[2349] On the river of that name, and on the road from Thebes to\r\nAnthedon.\r\n\r\n[2350] Its site appears to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[2351] Enumerated by Homer with Aulis. Ancient critics have, without\r\nsufficient reason, identified it with Hysiæ.\r\n\r\n[2352] It was sacked by the Athenians, B.C. 413, and in ruins in the\r\ntime of Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[2353] The modern Grimadha or Grimala occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[2354] The modern channel of Egripo.\r\n\r\n[2355] The place where the Grecian fleet assembled when about to sail\r\nfor Troy. Leake says that its harbour is now called Vathy, evidently\r\nfrom the Greek βαθὺς, “wide.”\r\n\r\n[2356] So called from dwelling near Mount Cnemis.\r\n\r\n[2357] Its ruins are to be seen three miles from the modern Talanti.\r\n\r\n[2358] Now the Golfo di Talanti.\r\n\r\n[2359] On the Eubœan Sea, which here extended to the Corinthian Gulf.\r\nIt was in ruins in the time of Strabo. Cynus was the chief sea-port of\r\nthe Locri Opuntii. Its site is marked by a tower called Palæopyrgo, and\r\nsome ruins to the south of the village of Livanates.\r\n\r\n[2360] The modern village of Lefti stands on its site, and there are\r\nsome ruins to be seen.\r\n\r\n[2361] In C. iv. of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2362] Or Cnemides, a fortress built on the range of Mount Cnemis, near\r\nthe modern Nikoraki.\r\n\r\n[2363] Ravaged by Philip of Macedon. Its ruins are near the modern\r\nvillage of Vogdhani.\r\n\r\n[2364] The Lower Larymna. Its ruins are seen between the modern\r\nMatzumadi and Martini.\r\n\r\n[2365] Its ruins are to be seen near the modern Andera.\r\n\r\n[2366] Between Daphnus and Cynus. Gell found its ruins on a hill near\r\nthe sea-shore.\r\n\r\n[2367] Its ruins are to be seen three miles from those of Thronium.\r\n\r\n[2368] Now called the Gulf of Zeitoun. The people from whom it received\r\nits name were the Malienses.\r\n\r\n[2369] Its ruins are two leagues from the modern town of Zeitoun.\r\n\r\n[2370] Or Sperchia.\r\n\r\n[2371] Strabo says that it lay below the town of Pindus. It is perhaps\r\nthe present Palæo Choria.\r\n\r\n[2372] Its ruins are placed by Leake near the modern Mariolates.\r\n\r\n[2373] Like Pindus, one of the four towns or Tetrapolis of Doris. Its\r\nsite corresponds to the modern Gravia.\r\n\r\n[2374] He seems to think that the name Græcus is older than that of\r\nHellen, in which he is supported by Apollodorus.\r\n\r\n[2375] So called from Echion, fabled to have sprung from the dragon’s\r\nteeth. Its site is marked by the modern village called Akhino. The\r\nSperchius is now called the Ellada.\r\n\r\n[2376] This famous spot still retains its name. It is also called Bocca\r\ndi Lupo.\r\n\r\n[2377] From τραχὺς, “narrow,” in allusion to the narrowness of the\r\nmountain passes. Brotier places it on the site of the modern Zeitoun,\r\nbut he is probably in error.\r\n\r\n[2378] A peak of the range of Œta.\r\n\r\n[2379] The name of a town and small district of Phthiotis: it\r\neventually gave its name to the whole of Greece, which by its\r\ninhabitants was called Hellas.\r\n\r\n[2380] Near the river Amphrysus. Leake places it at Kefalosi, at the\r\nextremity of Mount Othrys.\r\n\r\n[2381] The modern Zeitoun.\r\n\r\n[2382] Said to have been the city of Achilles.\r\n\r\n[2383] According to Stephanus of Byzantium, Cierium was identical with\r\nArne. Leake places it at the modern Mataranga.\r\n\r\n[2384] So called from the people called Minyæ, who derived their name\r\nfrom Minyas, the father of Orchomenus. In the time of Strabo, this\r\ncity, the capital of the Minyan empire, was in ruins. Its site is now\r\ncalled Seripu.\r\n\r\n[2385] Leake places its site on the left bank of the Peneius, opposite\r\nthe village of Gunitza.\r\n\r\n[2386] The residence of Admetus, and in later times of the tyrants of\r\nThessaly. The modern Valestina occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[2387] Spoken of in C. 17 of the present book.\r\n\r\n[2388] The ancient capital of the Pelasgi. It is now called Larissa,\r\nLarza, or Ienitchen.\r\n\r\n[2389] Leake places Gomphi on the heights now called Episkopi, on the\r\nleft bank of the Bliuri.\r\n\r\n[2390] Its ruins are said to be seen about eight miles from the modern\r\ncity of Volo.\r\n\r\n[2391] The city of Volo stands on its site. The Gulf is called the Bay\r\nof Volo.\r\n\r\n[2392] This is not strictly correct. Demetrias was founded by Demetrius\r\nPoliorcetes, about two or three miles to the west of Pagasa, the\r\ninhabitants of which were removed to that place. Its remains are to\r\nbe seen, according to Leake, on the face of a maritime height called\r\nGoritza.\r\n\r\n[2393] Pharsalus, now Farsa or Fersala, in Thessaliotis. On its plain\r\nPompey was defeated by Cæsar, B.C. 48.\r\n\r\n[2394] Or Cranon; said to have been anciently called Ephyre. Leake\r\nplaces its site at some ruins called Palea Larissa, distant two hours\r\nand twenty-seven minutes’ journey from Larissa. It was the residence of\r\nthe powerful family of the Scopadæ.\r\n\r\n[2395] This range in Macedonia is now called Verria. Herodotus states\r\nthat it was impassably for cold, and that beyond were the gardens of\r\nMidas, where roses grew spontaneously.\r\n\r\n[2396] The name of the eastern part of the great mountain chain\r\nextending west and east from the Promontory of Acroceraunia on the\r\nAdriatic to the Thermaic Gulf. It is now called by the Greeks Elymbo,\r\nand by the Turks Semavat-Evi, the “Abode of the Celestials.” A portion\r\nof this range was called Pierus; and Ossa, now Kissavo, the “ivy-clad,”\r\nwas divided from Olympus on the N.W. by the Vale of Tempe. Othrys\r\nextended from the south of Mount Pindus, to the eastern coast and the\r\nPromontory between the Gulf of Pagasa and the northern point of Eubœa.\r\n\r\n[2397] Now called Plessedhi or Zagora; situate in the district of\r\nMagnesia in Thessaly, between lake Bœbeis and the Pagasæan Gulf.\r\n\r\n[2398] Now the Gouropotamo.\r\n\r\n[2399] Flowing into the Asopus near Thermopylæ.\r\n\r\n[2400] In Pieria. Supposed to be the modern Litokhoro.\r\n\r\n[2401] The modern Rajani.\r\n\r\n[2402] This lake received the rivers Onchestus, Amyrus, and others.\r\nIt is now called Karla, from an adjoining village which has ceased to\r\nexist. The town of Bœbe was in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[2403] Now the Salambria or Salamria.\r\n\r\n[2404] The _jugerum_ was properly 240 feet long and 120 broad, but\r\nPliny uses it here solely as a measure of length; corresponding\r\nprobably to the Greek πλέθρον, 100 Grecian or 104 Roman feet long.\r\nTempe is the only channel through which the waters of the Thessalian\r\nplain flow into the sea.\r\n\r\n[2405] Il. B. ii. c. 262. He alludes to the poetical legend that the\r\nOrcus or Titaresius was a river of the infernal regions. Its waters\r\nwere impregnated with an oily substance, whence probably originated the\r\nstory of the unwillingness of the Peneus to mingle with it. It is now\r\ncalled the Elasonitiko or Xeraghi.\r\n\r\n[2406] Near Libethrum; said to be a favourite haunt of the Muses,\r\nwhence their name “Libethrides.” It is near the modern Goritza.\r\n\r\n[2407] Leake places its site on the height between the southernmost\r\nhouses of Volo and Vlakho-Makhala. No remains of it are to be seen.\r\n\r\n[2408] Ansart says that on its site stands the modern Korakai Pyrgos.\r\n\r\n[2409] Near Neokhori, and called Eleutherokhori.\r\n\r\n[2410] Now Kortos, near Argalisti, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[2411] Now Haghios Georgios, or the Promontory of St. George.\r\n\r\n[2412] At the foot of Mount Pelion. Leake places it at some ruins near\r\na small port called Tamukhari. The chestnut tree derived its Greek and\r\nmodern name from this place, in the vicinity of which it still abounds.\r\n\r\n[2413] Probably near the village of Hagia Eutimia, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[2414] Now Trikeri.\r\n\r\n[2415] Melibœa was near the modern Mintzeles, and Rhizus near Pesi\r\nDendra, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[2416] Ansart says, in the vicinity of the modern Conomio.\r\n\r\n[2417] Situate at the foot of Mount Homole, between Tempe and the\r\nvillage of Karitza. Leake thinks that the Convent of St. Demetrius, on\r\nthe lower part of Mount Kissavo, stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[2418] Now Tournovo, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[2419] Now called Democo, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[2420] Between the Titaresius and the Peneus. The modern village of\r\nTatari stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[2421] Probably the place of the same name mentioned in the last\r\nChapter.\r\n\r\n[2422] Probably the same as Acharræ on the river Pamisus, mentioned by\r\nLivy, B. xxxii. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[2423] On the Dotian Plain, mentioned by Hesiod, and probably the same\r\nplace that Pindar calls Lacereia.\r\n\r\n[2424] The birth-place of Protesilaüs, the first victim of the Trojan\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n[2425] Nothing is known of this place. The word “porro” appears instead\r\nof it in some editions.\r\n\r\n[2426] Philip, the Conqueror of Greece, and Alexander, the Conqueror of\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n[2427] The original Emathia, as mentioned by Homer, is coupled with\r\nPieria as lying between the Hellenic cities of Thessaly and Pæonia, and\r\nThrace.\r\n\r\n[2428] A tribe of the south-west of Mœsia, and extending over a part\r\nof Illyricum. According to Strabo, they were a wild race, of filthy\r\nhabits, living in caves under dunghills, but fond of music.\r\n\r\n[2429] A people of Mœsia, mentioned in C. 29 of the last Book.\r\n\r\n[2430] Supposed by some writers to be the same place as Edessa. Ansart\r\nsays it is the spot now known as Moglena.\r\n\r\n[2431] Now Verria in Roumelia. St. Paul and Silas withdrew to this\r\nplace from Thessalonica. The remains are very considerable.\r\n\r\n[2432] Described by Livy as of great strength. It occupied the site of\r\nthe modern Stagus.\r\n\r\n[2433] Surnamed Lyncestis; the chief town of Upper Macedonia. It must\r\nhave stood not far from the modern town of Felurina.\r\n\r\n[2434] Now the Platamona.\r\n\r\n[2435] Now Kitron. The Romans usually called it Citron or Citrus.\r\n\r\n[2436] In the inmost recess of the Thermaic Gulf. Leake supposes it to\r\nhave occupied the site of the present Palea Khora, near Kapsokhori.\r\n\r\n[2437] Now the Vistritza, by the Turks called Inje-Karra. Cæsar calls\r\nit the boundary between Macedonia and Thessaly.\r\n\r\n[2438] The people apparently of Aloros just mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2439] Vallæ and Phylacæ appear to have been two towns of Pieria.\r\n\r\n[2440] The people of Cyrrhus; probably on the site of the present\r\nVistritza. Leake however makes a place called Paleokastro to occupy its\r\nsite. Tyrissæ was probably in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[2441] Now Alaklisi, upon a lake formed by the Lydias. Philip made it\r\nthe capital of Macedonia, and it was the birth-place of Alexander the\r\nGreat. It was made a Roman colony under the name of Julia Augusta Pella.\r\n\r\n[2442] Its ruins are still called Stoli.\r\n\r\n[2443] There were two places of this name in Macedonia; one called\r\nAntigonia Psaphara in Chalcidice, and the other in Pæonia.\r\n\r\n[2444] Between Idomene and the plains of Pella. As Pliny here says, it\r\nwas a different place from Europus of Almopia, by which the Rhœdias\r\nflows. Of the following places nothing seems to be known.\r\n\r\n[2445] Coupled by Herodotus with Pella. Eordæa seems to have been the\r\nname of the district on the river Eordaicus, identified with the modern\r\nDevol.\r\n\r\n[2446] They dwelt in the vicinity of Mount Scomium. The river Axius is\r\nthe modern Vardhari.\r\n\r\n[2447] Or Thrace.\r\n\r\n[2448] People of Paroræa in Thrace.\r\n\r\n[2449] The people probably of Eordæa, already mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2450] Leake thinks that Almopia was the name of the district now\r\ncalled Moglena.\r\n\r\n[2451] The Mygdones were a Thracian people in the east of Macedonia, on\r\nthe Thermaic Gulf.\r\n\r\n[2452] The people of Arethusa, a town of Bisaltia in Macedonia, in the\r\npass of Aulon. Euripides, the tragic poet, was buried here.\r\n\r\n[2453] A town of Mygdonia.\r\n\r\n[2454] The people of Idomene, a town about twelve miles from the pass\r\nof Stena, now Demirkapi, or the ‘Iron Gate,’ on the river Vardhari.\r\n\r\n[2455] Their district of Doberus is supposed to have been near the\r\nmodern Doghiran.\r\n\r\n[2456] It has been suggested that Garescus stood on the same site as\r\nthe modern Nurocopo. Many of these peoples are now entirely unknown.\r\n\r\n[2457] The people of Lyncestis, in Macedonia, of Illyrian origin and on\r\nthe frontiers of Illyria. Lyncus was the ancient capital, Heraclæa the\r\nmore modern one.\r\n\r\n[2458] Probably the inhabitants of the slopes of Mount Othrys.\r\n\r\n[2459] Amantia was properly in Illyria, to the south of the river Aoüs.\r\nLeake places it at Nivitza.\r\n\r\n[2460] A people of the north of Epirus, on the borders of Macedonia.\r\nThey were said to have derived their name from Orestes, who, after the\r\nmurder of his mother, founded in their territory the town of Argos\r\nOresticum.\r\n\r\n[2461] A Greek city of Illyria. Dr. Holland discovered its remains at\r\nGraditza on the Aoüs or Viosa.\r\n\r\n[2462] The bulwark of the Macedonian maritime frontier to the south.\r\nLeake discovered its site near the modern Malathria.\r\n\r\n[2463] On the right bank of the river Strymon in Thracian Macedonia. It\r\nstood on the site of the modern Zervokhori.\r\n\r\n[2464] A people of Epirus on the borders of Thessaly.\r\n\r\n[2465] In Mygdonia, at the mouth of the Axius—King Perseus put all its\r\nmale inhabitants to death. Its site was at or near the modern Kulakia.\r\n\r\n[2466] Now Saloniki. Its original name was Thermæ, but it was first\r\nmade an important city by Cassander, B.C. 315, who gave it its new name\r\nin honour of his wife, the sister of Alexander the Great: St. Paul\r\nvisited it about A.D. 53, and two years after addressed from Corinth\r\ntwo Epistles to his converts in the city.\r\n\r\n[2467] Polybius says, in Strabo, B. vii., 267 miles.\r\n\r\n[2468] As already mentioned, Thermæ became merged in Thessalonica, when\r\nrefounded by Cassander under that name.\r\n\r\n[2469] Now the Gulf of Saloniki.\r\n\r\n[2470] This is probably an error. Pydna, already mentioned, lay far\r\ninland in the district of Pieria.\r\n\r\n[2471] On the peninsula of Pallene. Its male inhabitants were put to\r\ndeath by the Athenians in the Peloponnesian war.\r\n\r\n[2472] Now Capo Paliuri, the extreme point of the Isthmus of Pallene.\r\n\r\n[2473] The most westerly of the three peninsulas of Chalcidice. Phlegra\r\nis generally understood to have been its former name.\r\n\r\n[2474] Perhaps the same as Nyssa, between the rivers Nestus or Mestus,\r\nand Strymon.\r\n\r\n[2475] Its ruins are now called Pinaka. It was a colony of the\r\nCorinthians but refounded by Cassander, King Philip having previously\r\ndestroyed the city.\r\n\r\n[2476] South-east of Thessalonica, and north of Chalcidice. It was\r\ngiven by King Philip to the Olynthians.\r\n\r\n[2477] Near Mount Athos.\r\n\r\n[2478] Now Molivo, at the head of the Toronaic Gulf, part of which\r\nthence took its name.\r\n\r\n[2479] The name of a promontory at the extremity of the peninsula of\r\nSithonia, in Chalcidice. It seems to correspond with the modern Capo\r\nKartali.\r\n\r\n[2480] In the district of Chalcidice, on the S.W. of the peninsula of\r\nSithonia.\r\n\r\n[2481] On the east of the peninsula of Sithonia. It gave its name to\r\nthe Sinus Singiticus or Singitic Gulf.\r\n\r\n[2482] Now Monte Santo, at the end of the long peninsula running out\r\nfrom Chalcidice.\r\n\r\n[2483] This is a mistake. It is only forty miles in length. From Lieut.\r\nSmith (_Journal of Royal Geogr. Soc._ vol. vii. p. 65) we learn that\r\nits average breadth is about four miles; consequently Pliny’s statement\r\nas to its circumference must be greatly exaggerated. Juvenal, Sat.\r\nx. l. 174, mentions the story of the canal as a specimen of Greek\r\nfalsehood; but distinct traces have survived, to be seen by modern\r\ntravellers, all the way from the Gulf of Monte Santo to the Bay of Erso\r\nin the Gulf of Contessa, except about 200 yards in the middle, which\r\nhas been probably filled up.\r\n\r\n[2484] Or Acrothoüm. Pliny, with Strabo and Mela, errs in thinking\r\nthat it stood _on_ the _mountain_. It stood on the _peninsula_ only,\r\nprobably on the site of the modern Lavra.\r\n\r\n[2485] Or the ‘Heaven City,’ from its elevated position. It was founded\r\nby Alexarchus, brother of Cassander, king of Macedon.\r\n\r\n[2486] Probably on the west side of the peninsula, south of Thyssus.\r\n\r\n[2487] Or “long-lived.”\r\n\r\n[2488] Now Erisso; on the east side of the Isthmus, about a mile and a\r\nhalf from the canal of Xerxes. There are ruins here of a large mole.\r\n\r\n[2489] A little to the north of the Isthmus now called Stavro. It was\r\nthe birth-place of Aristotle the philosopher, commonly called the\r\nStagirite, and was, in consequence, restored by Philip, by whom it had\r\nbeen destroyed; or, as Pliny says in B. vii. c. 30, by Alexander the\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\n[2490] The name of the central one of the three peninsulas projecting\r\nfrom Chalcidice. The poets use the word _Sithonius_ frequently as\r\nsignifying ‘Thracian.’\r\n\r\n[2491] Possibly not the same as the Heraclea Sintica previously\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[2492] Now called Pollina, south of Lake Bolbe, on the road from\r\nThessalonica to Amphipolis.\r\n\r\n[2493] Sacred to Poseidon or Neptune. Now Capo Stavros in Thessaly,\r\nthe west front of the Gulf of Pagasa, if indeed this is the place here\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\n[2494] On the left or eastern bank of the river Strymon, which flowed\r\nround it, whence its name Amphi-polis, “round the city.” Its site is\r\nnow occupied by a village called Neokhorio, in Turkish Jeni-Keni or\r\n“Newtown.” A few remains are still to be seen. The bay at the mouth of\r\nthe Strymon, now Struma or Kara-Sou, is called the Gulf of Orphano.\r\n\r\n[2495] A Thracian people, extending from the river Strymon on the east\r\nto Crestonica on the west.\r\n\r\n[2496] In Mount Scomius namely, one of the Hæmus or Balkan range.\r\n\r\n[2497] Under Alexander the Great. On his death his empire was torn in\r\npieces by the contentions of his generals.\r\n\r\n[2498] In allusion to the legendary accounts of the Indian expeditions\r\nof Bacchus and Hercules.\r\n\r\n[2499] On the conquest of Perseus. Plutarch says that these seventy\r\ncities were pillaged in one and the same hour. They were thus punished\r\nfor their support of Perseus.\r\n\r\n[2500] Alexander the Great and Paulus Æmilius.\r\n\r\n[2501] Or præfectures, as the Romans called them.\r\n\r\n[2502] In the last Chapter.\r\n\r\n[2503] An extensive tribe occupying the country about the rivers Axius,\r\nStrymon, and Nestus or Mestus.\r\n\r\n[2504] This river is now called the Mesto or Kara-Sou.\r\n\r\n[2505] A range between the Strymon and the Nestus, now the Pangea or\r\nDespoto-Dagh.\r\n\r\n[2506] Probably a canton or division of the Bessi.\r\n\r\n[2507] The most powerful people of Thrace; dwelling on both sides of\r\nthe Artiscus, and on the plain of the Hebrus.\r\n\r\n[2508] Now the Maritza. It rises near the point where Mount Scomius\r\njoins Mount Rhodope. The localities of most of the tribes here named\r\nare unknown.\r\n\r\n[2509] The name of this people is often used by the poets to express\r\nthe whole of Thrace. The district of Edonis, on the left bank of the\r\nStrymon, properly extended from Lake Cercinitis as far east as the\r\nriver Nestus.\r\n\r\n[2510] Or “Trouble City,” also called Eumolpias.\r\n\r\n[2511] Or “Philip’s City,” founded by Philip of Macedon; still called\r\nPhilippopoli.\r\n\r\n[2512] Because it stood on a hill with three summits. Under the Roman\r\nempire it was the capital of the province of Thracia.\r\n\r\n[2513] On account probably of the winding nature of the roads; as\r\nthe height of the Balkan range in no part exceeds 3000 feet. With\r\nTheopompus probably originated the erroneous notion among the ancients\r\nas to its exceeding height.\r\n\r\n[2514] The people of Mœsia. The Aorsi and Getæ are again mentioned in\r\nC. 25 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2515] The inhabitants of the present Bulgaria, it is supposed.\r\n\r\n[2516] Following the account which represent him as a king of the\r\nCicones, and dwelling in the vicinity of Mount Rhodope. The Sithonii\r\nhere mentioned dwelt about the mouth of the Ister, or Danube, and were\r\na different people from those of Sithonia, in Chalcidice, referred to\r\nin a previous note.\r\n\r\n[2517] The Sea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n[2518] It is difficult to conceive which place of this name is here\r\nalluded to, as there seem to have been four places on this coast so\r\ncalled, and all mentioned by Pliny in the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2519] Called Æsyma by Homer; between the rivers Strymon and Nestus.\r\n\r\n[2520] Now called Kavallo, on the Strymonic Gulf. The site of Datos\r\nappears to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[2521] Now called Filiba, or Felibejik, on a height of Mount Pangæus,\r\non the river Gangites, between the Nestus and the Strymon. It was\r\nfounded by Philip, on the site of the ancient town of Crenides, in the\r\nvicinity of the gold mines. Here Augustus and Antony defeated Brutus\r\nand Cassius, B.C. 42; and here the Apostle Paul first preached the\r\nGospel in Europe, A.D. 53. See Acts xvi. 12.\r\n\r\n[2522] Its site seems unknown, but it is evidently a different place\r\nfrom that mentioned in the last Chapter.\r\n\r\n[2523] Also called Mestus.\r\n\r\n[2524] Sintica, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2525] Now Aco Mamas, at the head of the Toronaic Gulf. It was the\r\nmost important Greek city on the coast of Macedon. It was taken and\r\ndestroyed by Philip, B.C. 347, and its inhabitants sold as slaves.\r\nMecyberna, already mentioned, was used as its sea-port.\r\n\r\n[2526] On the coast, and east of the river Nestus. Its people were\r\nproverbial for their stupidity, though it produced the philosophers\r\nDemocritus, Protagoras, and Anaxarchus. No traces of its site are to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n[2527] Now called the Lagos Buru. The name of the Bistones is sometimes\r\nused by the poets for that of the Thracians in general.\r\n\r\n[2528] Or mares rather. Diomedes was the son of Ares, or Mars, and king\r\nof the Bistones. He was slain by Hercules.\r\n\r\n[2529] By some identified with the modern Curnu, by others with Bauron.\r\n\r\n[2530] Or Ismarus, at the foot of Mount Ismarus.\r\n\r\n[2531] Now Marogna.\r\n\r\n[2532] A promontory opposite the island of Samothrace.\r\n\r\n[2533] A town on a promontory of the same name, said to have been\r\nfrequented by Orpheus.\r\n\r\n[2534] The Plain of Doriscus is now called the Plain of Romigik.\r\nParisot suggests the true reading here to be 100,000, or, as some MSS.\r\nhave it, 120,000, there being nothing remarkable in a plain containing\r\n10,000 men. Pliny however does not mention it as being remarkable, but\r\nmerely suggests that the method used by Xerxes here for numbering his\r\nhost is worthy of attention.\r\n\r\n[2535] Now the Maritza. At its mouth it divides into two branches, the\r\neastern forming the port of Stentor.\r\n\r\n[2536] Still called Enos.\r\n\r\n[2537] A son of Priam and Hecuba, murdered by Polymnestor, king of the\r\nThracian Chersonesus, to obtain his treasures. See the Æneid, B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2538] From the Greek, μάκρον τεῖχος.\r\n\r\n[2539] Now the Gulf of Enos.\r\n\r\n[2540] Now Ipsala, or Chapsylar, near Keshan.\r\n\r\n[2541] Now Rodosto, or Rodostshig, on the coast of the Propontis, or\r\nSea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n[2542] Now called the Peninsula of the Dardanelles, or of Gallipoli.\r\nThe wall was built to protect it from incursions from the mainland.\r\n\r\n[2543] He here skips nearly five degrees of latitude, and at once\r\nproceeds to the northern parts of Thrace, at the mouth of the Danube,\r\nand moves to the south.\r\n\r\n[2544] Or, the “city of the Ister,” at the south of Lake Halmyris, on\r\nthe Euxine. Its site is not exactly known; but by some it is supposed\r\nto have been the same with that of the modern Kostendsje.\r\n\r\n[2545] Now Temesvar, or Jegni Pangola, the capital of Scythia Minor. It\r\nwas said to have been so called from the Greek τέμνω, “to cut,” because\r\nMedea here cut to pieces the body of her brother Absyrtus. It is famous\r\nas the place of Ovid’s banishment; and here he wrote his ‘Tristia’ and\r\nhis ‘Pontic Epistles.’\r\n\r\n[2546] Usually identified with the modern Collat, or Collati.\r\n\r\n[2547] Its site does not appear to be known, nor yet those of many of\r\nthe towns here mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2548] This story no doubt arose from the similarity of its name to\r\nγέρανος, “a crane;” the cranes and the Pigmies, according to the\r\npoets, being in a state of continual warfare.\r\n\r\n[2549] Supposed to be the present Varna.\r\n\r\n[2550] Now called Daphne-Soui, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[2551] Said to have been built by Aristæus, son of Apollo.\r\n\r\n[2552] Now Missivri.\r\n\r\n[2553] Or Anchiale, now Akiali.\r\n\r\n[2554] Now Sizeboli, famous for its temple of Apollo, with his statue,\r\nthirty cubits in height, which Lucullus carried to Rome. In later times\r\nit was called Sozopolis.\r\n\r\n[2555] Now Tiniada.\r\n\r\n[2556] The present Midjeh, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[2557] Afterwards called Zagora, which name it still bears.\r\n\r\n[2558] Or Straits of Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[2559] Between Galata and Fanar, according to Brotier.\r\n\r\n[2560] Or Golden Horn; still known by that name.\r\n\r\n[2561] The site of the present Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[2562] These rivers do not appear to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[2563] The present Silivri occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[2564] An important town of Thrace. Eski Erckli stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[2565] Now Vizia, or Viza.\r\n\r\n[2566] He alludes to the poetical story of Tereus, king of Thrace,\r\nProgne, and Philomela. Aldrovandus suggests that the real cause of the\r\nabsence of the swallow is the great prevalence here of northern winds,\r\nto which they have an aversion.\r\n\r\n[2567] So called probably from the Thracian tribe of the Cænici, or\r\nCæni.\r\n\r\n[2568] Now called Erkene, a tributary of the Hebrus.\r\n\r\n[2569] All that is known of it is, that it is mentioned as a fortress\r\non the Propontis.\r\n\r\n[2570] Hexamila now occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[2571] The isthmus or neck of the Peninsula of Gallipoli, or the\r\nDardanelles.\r\n\r\n[2572] That of Corinth. They are both about five miles wide at the\r\nnarrowest part.\r\n\r\n[2573] Now Cardia, or Caridia. It was the birth-place of king Eumenes.\r\n\r\n[2574] From καρδία, in consequence of its supposed resemblance to a\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n[2575] Lysimachus destroyed Cardia, and, building Lysimachia, peopled\r\nit with the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[2576] Mannert identities it with the ancient Ægos and the modern\r\nGalata.\r\n\r\n[2577] More generally called Ægospotamos, the “Goat River,” upon which\r\nthe town of Ægos stood. It was here that Lysander defeated the Athenian\r\nfleet, B.C. 405, which put an end to the Peloponnesian war.\r\n\r\n[2578] Antoninus, in his Itinerary, makes this distance twenty-six\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n[2579] B. ii. c. 92. The present Straits of Gallipoli.\r\n\r\n[2580] Now Gallipoli, a place of considerable commercial importance.\r\n\r\n[2581] Now Ialova; famous in Grecian poetry, with Abydos, for the loves\r\nof Hero and Leander.\r\n\r\n[2582] Now Lamsaki.\r\n\r\n[2583] The village of Aidos, or Avido, probably marks its site. To the\r\nnorth, Xerxes passed over to Sestos on his bridge of boats, B.C. 480.\r\n\r\n[2584] Now Capo Helles.\r\n\r\n[2585] Now Jeni-Hisari, the N.W. promontory of Troas. Here Homer places\r\nthe Grecian camp during the Trojan war.\r\n\r\n[2586] Meaning the “Bitch’s tomb,” the fable being that Hecuba, in her\r\nold age, was changed into that animal. It was near the town of Madytus.\r\n\r\n[2587] Meaning that their fleet was anchored off here during the Trojan\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n[2588] A magnificent temple was erected near his tomb at Eleus, where\r\nhe also had a sacred grove. It was greatly enriched by the votive\r\nofferings of Greek travellers. According to D’Anville, its site lay to\r\nthe south of Mastusia.\r\n\r\n[2589] Now called Kilidbahr. Near this place the Spartans were defeated\r\nby the Athenians, who erected a trophy near the tomb of Hecuba.\r\n\r\n[2590] In the present Chapter; where he says that the distance from\r\nByzantium to Dyrrhachium is 711 miles. See p. 305.\r\n\r\n[2591] Αἲξ, “a goat.” Other authors give other derivations for the name\r\nof Ægean,—from the town of Ægæ in Eubœa, or from Ægeus, the father\r\nof Theseus, who threw himself into it; or from Ægæa, a queen of the\r\nAmazons, who perished there; or from Ægæon, a god of the sea; or from\r\nthe Greek αἰγὶς, “a squall,” on account of its storms.\r\n\r\n[2592] See c. 5 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2593] Both places in Eubœa, mentioned in c. 21 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2594] Now Corfu. Of its city of Corcyra only a few ruins now exist.\r\n\r\n[2595] There are still some remains of it near the village called\r\nCassopo.\r\n\r\n[2596] Now Fano, or Merlere.\r\n\r\n[2597] Now Paxo and Antipaxo.\r\n\r\n[2598] On the contrary, they lie at the other end of the isle of\r\nCorcyra. Some of them are mere rocks, and cannot be distinguished by\r\ntheir ancient names. The present names of four are Sametraki, Diaplo,\r\nBoaia, and the Isle of Ulysses.\r\n\r\n[2599] Now Capo Drasti.\r\n\r\n[2600] Now Capo Levkimo. The islands are those of Santo Niccolo.\r\n\r\n[2601] Or Islands of the Teleboans.\r\n\r\n[2602] These three seem to be those now called Magnisi, Kalamota,\r\nand Kastus. These lie facing the promontory of Leucadia, the others\r\nopposite Ætolia.\r\n\r\n[2603] Opposite Acarnania: by the Venetians they were called the\r\nIslands of Kurtzolari. Some of them are cultivated, others again are\r\nmere rocks.\r\n\r\n[2604] Now called Cephallenia.\r\n\r\n[2605] Now Zante.\r\n\r\n[2606] Now Thiaki, or Cefalogna Piccola—Little Cephallenia.\r\n\r\n[2607] The general opinion is, that Strabo is right in identifying this\r\nisland with one of the Echinades; but it seems impossible now to say\r\nwhich of them was so called.\r\n\r\n[2608] Sometimes confounded with Cephallenia; but, according to Virgil\r\nand Mela, as well as Pliny, they were different islands.\r\n\r\n[2609] Crocylæa was a town of Acarnania, referred to by Homer; and\r\nthere was a district of Ithaca called Crocylcium. Pliny is probably in\r\nerror in mentioning Crocyle as an island.\r\n\r\n[2610] Or the “Black Island;” probably from its thick foliage.\r\n\r\n[2611] Pale, Cranii, and Proni.\r\n\r\n[2612] So called from its fir-trees. It now has the name of Scopo.\r\n\r\n[2613] Now Monte Stefano.\r\n\r\n[2614] See c. 6 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2615] Supposed by some writers to be the same with the rocky isle now\r\ncalled Dyscallio. Though mentioned by Homer, its existence was disputed\r\nby many of the ancient commentators.\r\n\r\n[2616] The modern Strivali and Stamphane.\r\n\r\n[2617] The present Guardiania, according to Lapie.\r\n\r\n[2618] According to Ansart, these were Prote, now Prodano, and Sphagia,\r\nformerly Sphacteria, before Pylos, now called Zonchio, or Old Navarino;\r\nthe third being perhaps the isle of Bechli, in the Bay of Navarino.\r\n\r\n[2619] Now called Sapienza, Santa Maria, and Cabrera.\r\n\r\n[2620] Venetico and Formignes are the names of two of them.\r\n\r\n[2621] Now Servi.\r\n\r\n[2622] The modern Cerigo.\r\n\r\n[2623] It is much further from the Cape of Malea or Santo Angelo than\r\nthe distance here mentioned. It derived its name of Porphyris from the\r\npurple fishery established here by the Phœnicians.\r\n\r\n[2624] The modern Isle of Port Tolon. Irine is the present Hipsyli\r\naccording to Leake, who also identifies Ephyre with Spetzia.\r\n\r\n[2625] At the south of Argolis.\r\n\r\n[2626] The modern Dhoko, according to Leake. Some authorities think\r\nthat Tiparenus, and not Ephyre, is the modern Spetzia.\r\n\r\n[2627] Leake thinks that Colonis and Hydreia, now called Hydra, were\r\nthe same island; but Kiepert thinks it the same as the small island to\r\nthe south of Spetzia.\r\n\r\n[2628] Now Poros.\r\n\r\n[2629] These are the islands now called Moni Jorench, Kophinidia, and\r\nSan Giorgio d’Arbora. It is perhaps impossible to identify them, except\r\nthat Belbina is generally supposed to be the island of San Giorgio.\r\n\r\n[2630] Now Kyra.\r\n\r\n[2631] The modern Angistri.\r\n\r\n[2632] Which name, or Eghina, it still retains.\r\n\r\n[2633] See c. 9 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2634] Probably the modern Laoussa, one of this group.\r\n\r\n[2635] By Brotier said to be the modern Pentenesia. The other islands\r\nhere mentioned seem not to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[2636] Now Cerigotto.\r\n\r\n[2637] Dalechamps suggests Hesperus.\r\n\r\n[2638] The island “of the Blessed.”\r\n\r\n[2639] Now Capo Salomon.\r\n\r\n[2640] From the Greek κριοῦ μέτωπον, “the ram’s forehead”; now called\r\nCapo Crio.\r\n\r\n[2641] Also called Elæa. Pococke speaks of it as a promontory called\r\nChaule-burnau.\r\n\r\n[2642] Hardouin calls it Chisamo.\r\n\r\n[2643] The modern Khania. The quince derived its Latin name, “Malum\r\nCydonium,” from this district, to which it was indigenous. From its\r\nLatin name it was called _melicotone_ by the writers of the Elizabethan\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[2644] Now Minolo, according to Hardouin.\r\n\r\n[2645] The port of Apteron, or Aptera, which Mr. Pashley supposes to be\r\ndenoted by the ruins of Palæokastro; he also thinks that its port was\r\nat or near the modern Kalyres.\r\n\r\n[2646] Now La Suda, according to Hardouin, who says that Rhithymna is\r\ncalled Retimo; Panormus, Panormo; and Cytæum, Setia.\r\n\r\n[2647] Supposed by Ansart to have stood in the vicinity of the modern\r\ncity of Candia.\r\n\r\n[2648] Strabo says that it stood on the narrowest part of the island,\r\nopposite Minoa. Vestiges of it have been found at the Kastéle of\r\nHierapetra. Its foundation was ascribed to the Corybantes.\r\n\r\n[2649] Now Lionda.\r\n\r\n[2650] Next to Cnossus in splendour and importance. Mr. Pashley places\r\nits site near the modern Haghius Dheka, the place of the martyrdom of\r\nthe ten Saints, according to tradition, in the Decian persecution.\r\n\r\n[2651] It has been remarked, that Pliny is mistaken here if he intends\r\nto enumerate Cnossus among the towns of the interior of Crete. The only\r\nremains of this capital of Crete, situate on the north of the island,\r\nare those seen at Makro-Teikho, or the “Long Walls,” so called from the\r\nmasses of Roman brick-work there seen.\r\n\r\n[2652] Though an inland town, it probably stood in the vicinity of\r\nthe headland or promontory of the same name, which is now called Kavo\r\nStavro. Many of these names are utterly unknown.\r\n\r\n[2653] One of the most important towns of Crete, on the N.W. slope of\r\nMount Ida, about fifty stadia from the port of Astale. Mr. Pashley says\r\nthat some remains probably of this place are still to be seen on a hill\r\nnear a place called Eletherna, five miles south of the great convent of\r\nArkadhi.\r\n\r\n[2654] The loftiest point of the mountain-range that traverses the\r\nisland of Crete from west to east. Its head is covered with snow. The\r\nmodern name is Psiloriti, looking down on the plain of Mesara. The word\r\n_Ida_ is supposed to mean a mountain in which mines are worked, and the\r\nIdæi Dactyli of Crete were probably among the first workers in iron and\r\nbronze. The position of Mount Cadistus, belonging to the range of White\r\nMountains, has been fixed by Hoeck at Cape Spadha, the most northerly\r\npoint of the island. It is thought that Pliny and Solinus are in error\r\nin speaking of Cadistus and Dictynnæus as separate peaks, these being,\r\nboth of them, names of the mountain of which the cape was formed; the\r\nlatter name having been given in later times, from the worship and\r\ntemple there of Dictynna.\r\n\r\n[2655] Now Grabusa, the N.W. promontory of Crete.\r\n\r\n[2656] Now Ras-al-Sem, or Cape Rasat, in Africa. The distance,\r\naccording to Brotier, is in reality about 225 miles.\r\n\r\n[2657] Now Skarpanto.\r\n\r\n[2658] According to Hardouin, all of these are mere rocks rather than\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n[2659] The modern Haghios Theodhoros.\r\n\r\n[2660] According to Hoeck, they are now called Turlure.\r\n\r\n[2661] Now called Standiu.\r\n\r\n[2662] Now Capo Xacro, on the east, though Cape Salomon, further north,\r\nhas been suggested. In the latter case, the Grandes islands would\r\ncorrespond with Onisia and Leuce, mentioned by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2663] Now Gaidurognissa. None of the other islands here mentioned seem\r\nto have been identified.\r\n\r\n[2664] Between Eubœa and Locris. They are now called Ponticonesi.\r\n\r\n[2665] Now Koluri. It is memorable for the naval battle fought off its\r\ncoast, when Xerxes was defeated by the Greeks, B.C. 480.\r\n\r\n[2666] Now called Lypsokutali.\r\n\r\n[2667] Now Makronisi, or “the Long Island.” Its ancient name was also\r\nMacris. Strabo identifies it with the Homeric Cranaë, to which Paris\r\nfled with Helen.\r\n\r\n[2668] Usually called Cea, one of the Cyclades, about thirteen miles\r\nS.E. of Sunium. Its modern name is Zea. Iulis was the most important\r\ntown, and the birth-place of the poets Simonides and Bacchylides, of\r\nthe sophist Prodicus, the physician Erasistratus, and the Peripatetic\r\nphilosopher Ariston. Extensive remains of it still exist.\r\n\r\n[2669] There are considerable remains of this town, called by the\r\ninhabitants Stais Palais.\r\n\r\n[2670] Or Coresia. It was the harbour of Iulis, to which place we learn\r\nfrom Strabo that its inhabitants were transferred.\r\n\r\n[2671] On the S.W. side of the island. Its ruins are inconsiderable,\r\nbut retain their ancient name.\r\n\r\n[2672] Now called Eubœa, as also Egripo, or Negropont,—a corruption of\r\nthe former word and “pont,” “a bridge.”\r\n\r\n[2673] Hardouin speaks of this as existing in his time, 1670, and being\r\n250 feet in length. It is supposed to have been first constructed about\r\nB.C. 411, for the purpose of uninterrupted communication with Bœotia.\r\n\r\n[2674] Now Capo Mandili.\r\n\r\n[2675] Now Kavo Doro, or Xylofago.\r\n\r\n[2676] Now Lithadha, with a mountain 2837 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\n[2677] These measurements are not exactly correct. The length from\r\nnorth to south is about ninety miles; the extreme breadth across,\r\nthirty, and in one part, not more than four miles.\r\n\r\n[2678] Still extant in the time of Strabo, who speaks of it as an\r\ninconsiderable place.\r\n\r\n[2679] Its site is now called Lipso. It contained warm baths sacred to\r\nHercules, and used by the Dictator Sylla. They are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[2680] Now Egripo, or Negropont, having given name to the rest of the\r\nisland. The Euripus is here only forty yards across, being crossed by\r\na bridge, partly of stone, partly of wood. The poet Lycophron and the\r\norator Isæus were natives of this place, and Aristotle died here.\r\n\r\n[2681] Near the promontory of that name, now Capo Mandili. In the\r\ntown there was a famous temple of Poseidon, or Neptune. According to\r\nHardouin, the modern name is Iastura.\r\n\r\n[2682] One of the most powerful cities of Eubœa. It was destroyed by\r\nthe Persians under Darius, and a new town was built to the south of the\r\nold one. New Eretria stood, according to Leake, at the modern Kastri,\r\nand old Eretria in the neighbourhood of Vathy. The tragic poet Achæus,\r\na contemporary of Æschylus, was born here; and a school of philosophy\r\nwas founded at this place by Menedemus, a disciple of Plato.\r\n\r\n[2683] Now Karysto, on the south of the island, at the foot of Mount\r\nOcha, upon which are supposed to have been its quarries of marble.\r\nThere are but few remains of the ancient city. The historian Antigonus,\r\nthe comic poet Apollodorus, and the physician Diocles, were natives of\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\n[2684] Probably on the promontory of the same name. It was off this\r\ncoast that the Greek fleet engaged that of Xerxes, B.C. 480.\r\n\r\n[2685] There were tame fish kept in this fountain; and its waters were\r\nsometimes disturbed by volcanic agency. Leake says that it has now\r\ntotally disappeared.\r\n\r\n[2686] From the fact of its producing copper, and of its being in shape\r\nlong and narrow.\r\n\r\n[2687] Strabo remarks, that Homer calls its inhabitants Abantes, while\r\nhe gives to the island the name of Eubœa. The poets say that it took\r\nits name from the cow (Βοῦς) Io, who gave birth to Epaphus on this\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n[2688] Hardouin remarks here, that Pliny, Strabo, Mela, and Pausanias\r\nuse the term “Myrtoan Sea,” as meaning that portion of it which lies\r\nbetween Crete and Attica, while Ptolemy so calls the sea which lies off\r\nthe coast of Caria.\r\n\r\n[2689] Now called Spitilus, and the group of Micronisia, or “Little\r\nIslands,” according to Hardouin.\r\n\r\n[2690] From κύκλος, “a circle.”\r\n\r\n[2691] Now Andro. It gives name to one of the comedies of Terence. The\r\nruins of the ancient city were found by the German traveller Ross, who\r\nhas published a hymn to Isis, in hexameter verse, which he discovered\r\nhere. It was famous for its wines.\r\n\r\n[2692] Now Tino.\r\n\r\n[2693] From its abounding in snakes (ὄφεις) and scorpions.\r\n\r\n[2694] Now Mycono, south-east of Tenos and east of Delos. It was\r\nfamous in ancient mythology as one of the places where Hercules was\r\nsaid to have defeated the Giants. It was also remarkable for the great\r\nproportion of bald persons among its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[2695] So called from its resemblance to two breasts, μαζοι.\r\n\r\n[2696] Wheeler says that the distance is but three miles; Tournefort,\r\nsix.\r\n\r\n[2697] Once famous for its gold and silver mines, but equally notorious\r\nfor the bad character of its people. It is now called Siphno.\r\n\r\n[2698] Now Serpho, lying between Cythnos and Siphnus.\r\n\r\n[2699] Now Fermina, according to Hardouin.\r\n\r\n[2700] Between Ceos and Seriphus. It is now called Thermia. Cydias the\r\npainter was born here, and it was famous for its cheeses. Its modern\r\nname is derived from its hot springs, which are much frequented.\r\n\r\n[2701] Still called Delos; and, though so celebrated, nothing more than\r\na mere rock, five miles in circumference.\r\n\r\n[2702] That is, according to Varro, whose statement is ridiculed\r\nby Seneca. Some of the editors, however, punctuate this passage\r\ndifferently, making it to mean, “the only island that has never\r\nexperienced an earthquake. Mucianus however has informed us, that down\r\nto the time of M. Varro, it has been twice so visited.”\r\n\r\n[2703] From its then becoming δῆλος, “plain,” or “manifest.” It was\r\nafter the fall of Corinth that Delos became so famous for its commerce.\r\nIts bronze was in great request.\r\n\r\n[2704] From ὄρτυξ, “a quail”; the legend being, that Latona was changed\r\ninto that bird by Jupiter, in order to effect her escape thither from\r\nthe anger of Juno. Its name of Asteria was derived from ἄστρον, “a\r\nstar,” either in consequence of its being devoted to the worship of\r\nthe great luminary Apollo, or of its being considered by the gods the\r\nstar of the earth. It was also called Lagia, from λαγὼς, “a hare,” that\r\nanimal abounding there; and Cynæthus, from κύων, “a dog,” it being\r\nfamous for its hounds.\r\n\r\n[2705] A bare granite rock, not more than 500 feet in height. The\r\nisland is now a mass of ruins; a great part of its remains having been\r\ncarried away in the middle ages to Venice and Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[2706] Divided by a strait of four stadia in width from Delos. Nicias\r\nconnected the two islands by a bridge. Its name of Celadussa was said\r\nto be derived from the noise of the waves, κέλαδος, and of Artemite,\r\nfrom Artemis, or Diana.\r\n\r\n[2707] Now Syra; famous for its wine and corn.\r\n\r\n[2708] Now Antiparos; famous for its stalactite grotto, which is not\r\nmentioned by the ancient writers.\r\n\r\n[2709] Now Paro; south of Delos and west of Naxos. The ruins of its\r\ntown are still to be seen at the modern Paroikia. The Parian Chronicle,\r\ninscribed on marble, and containing a chronicle of Grecian history from\r\nCecrops, B.C. 1582, to B.C. 264, was found here. It is preserved at\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\n[2710] Chiefly obtained from a mountain called Marpessa.\r\n\r\n[2711] Now Naxia, famous both in ancient and modern times for its\r\nremarkable fertility.\r\n\r\n[2712] From στρογγύλος, “round,” its shape being somewhat inclined\r\nto circular, though by Eustathius it is compared to the shape of a\r\nvine-leaf. It is commonly called Dia by the poets. Tournefort says that\r\nit is distant forty miles from Delos.\r\n\r\n[2713] From Διόνυσος, or Bacchus, the god of wine.\r\n\r\n[2714] Or “Fine City.” It took its other name from the fact of its\r\nrivalling the fertility of Sicily.\r\n\r\n[2715] According to Brotier, the Jesuit Babin, on visiting it, found\r\nits circumference estimated at thirty-six miles only.\r\n\r\n[2716] So called from lying scattered at random as it were, σπορὰς\r\n“scattered.”\r\n\r\n[2717] Helene is supposed to be the modern Pira; Phacussa, Fecussa;\r\nNicasia, Rachia; Schinussa, Schinusa; and Pholegandros, Policandro.\r\n\r\n[2718] Now Nikaria, to the west of Samos. According to tradition, it\r\nderived its name from Icarus, the son of Dædalus, who was believed to\r\nhave fallen into the sea in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[2719] Its length is not so great as is here mentioned by Pliny. Its\r\ntowns were Drepanum, or Dracanum, Œnoë, and Isti.\r\n\r\n[2720] The first two names are from the Greek, in allusion to its long,\r\nnarrow shape, and the last bears reference to the fact of its shores\r\nabounding in fish.\r\n\r\n[2721] Now Scyro, east of Eubœa, and one of the Sporades. Here Achilles\r\nwas said to have been concealed by his mother Thetis, in woman’s attire.\r\n\r\n[2722] Now Nio, one of the Sporades, inaccurately called by Stephanus\r\none of the Cyclades. The modern town is built on the site of the\r\nancient one, of which there are some remains. It was said that Homer\r\ndied here, on his voyage from Smyrna to Athens, and that his mother,\r\nClymene, was a native of this island. In 1773, Van Krienen, a Dutch\r\nnobleman, asserted that he had discovered the tomb of Homer here, with\r\ncertain inscriptions relative to him; but they have been generally\r\nregarded by the learned as forgeries. Odia and Oletandros seem not to\r\nhave been identified.\r\n\r\n[2723] Now called Gioura, or Jura. It was little better than a barren\r\nrock, though inhabited; but so notorious for its poverty, that its mice\r\nwere said to be able to gnaw through iron. It was used as a place of\r\nbanishment under the Roman emperors, whence the line of Juvenal, i. 73—\r\n\r\n  “Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum.”\r\n\r\n“Dare some deed deserving of the little Gyara and the gaol.” It is now\r\nuninhabited, except by a few shepherds in the summer.\r\n\r\n[2724] Now Telos, or Piskopi, a small island in the Carpathian Sea, and\r\none of the Sporades. It lies off the coast of Caria. Syrnos appears not\r\nto have been identified.\r\n\r\n[2725] Near Naxos. Virgil calls it ‘viridis,’ or ‘green,’ which\r\nServius explains by the colour of its marble. Like Gyara, it was used\r\nas a place of banishment under the Roman Empire. In C. 22, Pliny has\r\nmentioned Cynæthus as one of the names of Delos.\r\n\r\n[2726] Now Patmo, one of the Sporades, and west of the Promontory of\r\nPosidium, in Caria. To this place St. John was banished, and here he\r\nwrote the Apocalypse.\r\n\r\n[2727] A group between Icaria and Samos. They are now called Phurni and\r\nKrusi.\r\n\r\n[2728] One of the Sporades, now Lebitha.\r\n\r\n[2729] Now Lero. Its inhabitants were of Milesian origin, and of\r\nindifferent character. In its temple of Artemis, the sisters of\r\nMeleager were said to have been changed into guinea-fowls. It was\r\nopposite the coast of Caria.\r\n\r\n[2730] Now Zinari, N.E. of Amorgos. The artichoke (called κίναρα in\r\nGreek) is said to have given name to it.\r\n\r\n[2731] Now Sikino; between Pholegandros and Ios.\r\n\r\n[2732] So called, according to Stephanus, from its cultivation of the\r\nvine and produce of wine, οἶνος. It was situate between Pholegandros\r\nand Ios. It was said to have had the name of Sicinus from a son of\r\nThoas and Œnoë. Hieracia seems to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[2733] Still known by that name, and lying between Carpathus and Crete.\r\nThe ruins of the ancient town of Casos are still to be seen at the\r\nvillage of Polin. It is mentioned by Homer.\r\n\r\n[2734] Now Kimoli, one of the Cyclades, between Siphnos and Melos. It\r\ntook its name of Echinussa from the ‘Echinus,’ or Sea-urchin, of which\r\nvarious fossil specimens are still found on the coast; but nowhere\r\nelse in these islands, except the opposite coast of Melos. There are\r\nconsiderable ruins of its ancient town.\r\n\r\n[2735] Now Milo, the most westerly of the Cyclades. It is remarkable\r\nfor its extreme fertility. Its town, which, according to most\r\nauthorities, was called Byblis, was situate on the north of the island.\r\n\r\n[2736] Ansart remarks, that our author is mistaken in this assertion,\r\nfor not only are many others of these islands more circular in form,\r\nbut even that of Kimolo, which stands next to it.\r\n\r\n[2737] Now Amorgo, S.E. of Naxos. It was the birth-place of the\r\nIambic poet Simonides. It is noted for its fertility. Under the Roman\r\nemperors, it was used as a place of banishment.\r\n\r\n[2738] Now Polybos, or Antimelos, an uninhabited island near Melos.\r\nPhyle seems not to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[2739] Now Santorin, south of the island of Ios. The tradition was,\r\nthat it was formed from a clod of earth, thrown from the ship Argo. It\r\nis evidently of volcanic origin, and is covered with pumice-stone. It\r\nwas colonized by Lacedæmonians and Minyans of Lemnos, under the Spartan\r\nTheras, who gave his name to the island.\r\n\r\n[2740] A small island to the west of Thera, still known by the same\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[2741] In Lapie’s map, Ascania is set down as the present Christiana.\r\n\r\n[2742] Now Anaphe, Namfi, or Namphio, one of the Sporades. It was\r\ncelebrated for the temple of Apollo Ægletes, the foundation of which\r\nwas ascribed to the Argonauts, and of which considerable remains still\r\nexist. It abounds in partridges, as it did also in ancient times.\r\n\r\n[2743] Now Astropalæa, or Stamphalia. By Strabo it is called one of the\r\nSporades, by Stephanus one of the Cyclades. It probably was favoured\r\nby the Romans for the excellence and importance of its harbours. From\r\nHegesander we learn that it was famous for its hares, and Pliny tells\r\nus, in B. viii. c. 59, that its mussels were (as they still are) very\r\ncelebrated.\r\n\r\n[2744] None of these islands can be now identified, except perhaps\r\nChalcia, also mentioned by Strabo, and now known as Karki.\r\n\r\n[2745] Now Kalymno, the principal island of the group, by Homer called\r\nCalydne. According to most of the editions, Pliny mentions here\r\nCalydna and Calymna, making this island, which had those two names,\r\ninto two islands. Although Pliny here mentions only the town of Coös,\r\nstill, in B. v. c. 36, he speaks of three others, Notium, Nisyrus, and\r\nMendeterus. There are still some remains of antiquity to be seen here.\r\n\r\n[2746] Or Carpathus, now Skarpanto. It gave name to the sea between\r\nCrete and Rhodes.\r\n\r\n[2747] It still preserves its ancient name, and presents some\r\ninteresting remains of antiquity.\r\n\r\n[2748] Brotier says that the distance is really fifty-two miles.\r\n\r\n[2749] So called from the town of Petalia, on the mainland. Ansart says\r\nthat their present name is Spili.\r\n\r\n[2750] Now Talanti, giving name to the Channel of Talanti.\r\n\r\n[2751] The present Gulf of Volo, mentioned in C. 15 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2752] Ansart suggests that this may possibly be the small island now\r\ncalled Agios Nicolaos.\r\n\r\n[2753] Now Trikeri.\r\n\r\n[2754] In the present Chapter.\r\n\r\n[2755] Now Scangero, or Skantzoura, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[2756] Now the Gulf of Saloniki, mentioned in C. 17. The islands here\r\nmentioned have apparently not been identified.\r\n\r\n[2757] Off the coast of Thessaly, now Piperi.\r\n\r\n[2758] Now Skiathos. It was famous for its wine.\r\n\r\n[2759] Now called Embro, or Imru. Both the island and city of Imbros\r\nare mentioned by Homer.\r\n\r\n[2760] This is double the actual circumference of the island.\r\n\r\n[2761] Now called Stalimene.\r\n\r\n[2762] Its site is now called Palæo Kastro. Hephæstia, or Vulcan’s\r\nTown, stood near the modern Rapanidi. That god was said to have fallen\r\ninto this island when thrown from heaven by Jupiter.\r\n\r\n[2763] Now Thaso, or Tasso. Its gold mines were in early periods very\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n[2764] Mentioned in C. 17 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2765] Ansart says that “forty-two” would be the correct reading here,\r\nthat being also the distance between Samothrace and Thasos.\r\n\r\n[2766] Its modern name is Samothraki. It was the chief seat of the\r\nmysterious worship of the Cabiri.\r\n\r\n[2767] Only twelve, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[2768] Barely eighteen, according to Brotier.\r\n\r\n[2769] Now Monte Nettuno. Of course the height here mentioned by Pliny\r\nis erroneous; but Homer says that from this mountain Troy could be seen.\r\n\r\n[2770] Now called Skopelo, if it is the same island which is mentioned\r\nby Ptolemy under the name of Scopelus. It exports wine in large\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n[2771] Or the Fox Island, so called from its first settlers having\r\nbeen directed by an oracle to establish a colony where they should\r\nfirst meet a fox with its cub. Like many others of the islands here\r\nmentioned, it appears not to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[2772] See C. 18 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2773] None of these islands appear to have been identified by modern\r\ngeographers.\r\n\r\n[2774] Now generally known as the Palus Mæotis or Sea of Azof.\r\n\r\n[2775] The modern Caraboa, according to Brotier, stands on its site.\r\nPriapus was the tutelary divinity of Lampsacus in this vicinity.\r\n\r\n[2776] Or “entrance of Pontus”; now the Sea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n[2777] “Ox Ford,” or “passage of the cow,” Io being said to have\r\ncrossed it in that form: now called the “Straits of Constantinople.”\r\n\r\n[2778] Said to have been called ἄξενος or “inhospitable,” from its\r\nfrequent storms and the savage state of the people living on its\r\nshores. In later times, on the principle of Euphemism, or abstaining\r\nfrom words of ill omen, its name was changed to εὔξεινος, “hospitable.”\r\n\r\n[2779] This was a favourite comparison of the ancients; the north\r\ncoast, between the Thracian Bosporus and the Phasis, formed the bow,\r\nand the southern shores the string. The Scythian bow somewhat resembled\r\nin form the figure Σ, the capital Sigma of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n[2780] Now the Straits of Kaffa or Enikale.\r\n\r\n[2781] This town lay about the middle of the Tauric Chersonesus or\r\nCrimea, and was situate on a small peninsula, called the Smaller\r\nChersonesus, to distinguish it from the larger one, of which it formed\r\na part. It was founded by the inhabitants of the Pontic Heraclea, or\r\nHeracleium, the site of which is unknown. See note [2844] to p. 333.\r\n\r\n[2782] Now Kertsch, in the Crimea. It derived its name from the river\r\nPanticapes; and was founded by the Milesians about B.C. 541. It was the\r\nresidence of the Greek kings of Bosporus, and hence it was sometimes so\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n[2783] “Thirty-six” properly.\r\n\r\n[2784] The Tanais or Don does not rise in the Riphæan Mountains, or\r\nwestern branch of the Uralian chain, but on slightly elevated ground in\r\nthe centre of European Russia.\r\n\r\n[2785] Chap. 18 of the present Book. Istropolis is supposed to be the\r\npresent Istere, though some would make it to have stood on the site of\r\nthe present Kostendsje, and Brotier identifies it with Kara-Kerman.\r\n\r\n[2786] Now called the Schwarzwald or Black Forest. The Danube or Ister\r\nrises on the eastern side at the spot called Donaueschingen.\r\n\r\n[2787] So called from the Raurici, a powerful people of Gallia Belgica,\r\nwho possessed several towns, of which the most important were Augusta,\r\nnow Augst, and Basilia, now Bâle.\r\n\r\n[2788] Only three of these are now considered of importance, as being\r\nthe main branches of the river. It is looked upon as impossible by\r\nmodern geographers to identify the accounts given by the ancients with\r\nthe present channels, by name, as the Danube has undergone in lapse of\r\ntime, very considerable changes at its mouth. Strabo mentions seven\r\nmouths, three being lesser ones.\r\n\r\n[2789] So called, as stated by Pliny, from the island of Peuce, now\r\nPiczina. Peuce appears to have been the most southerly of the mouths.\r\n\r\n[2790] Now called Kara-Sou, according to Brotier. Also called Rassefu\r\nin the maps.\r\n\r\n[2791] Now called Hazrali Bogasi, according to Brotier. It is called by\r\nPtolemy the Narakian Mouth.\r\n\r\n[2792] Or the “Beautiful Mouth.” Now Susie Bogasi, according to Brotier.\r\n\r\n[2793] Or the “False Mouth”: now the Sulina Bogasi, the principal mouth\r\nof the Danube, so maltreated by its Russian guardians.\r\n\r\n[2794] Or the “Passage of the Gnats,” so called from being the resort\r\nof swarms of mosquitoes, which were said at a certain time of the year\r\nto migrate to the Palus Mæotis. According to Brotier the present name\r\nof this island is Ilan Adasi, or Serpent Island.\r\n\r\n[2795] The “Northern Mouth”: near the town of Kilia.\r\n\r\n[2796] Or the “Narrow Mouth.”\r\n\r\n[2797] Though Strabo distinguishes the Getæ from the Daci, most of the\r\nancient writers, with Pliny, speak of them as identical. It is not\r\nknown, however, why the Getæ in later times assumed the name of Daci.\r\n\r\n[2798] “Dwellers in waggons.” These were a Sarmatian tribe who wandered\r\nwith their waggons along the banks of the Volga. The chief seats of\r\nthe Aorsi, who seem in reality to have been a distinct people from\r\nthe Hamaxobii, was in the country between the Tanais, the Euxine, the\r\nCaspian, and the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n[2799] “Dwellers in Caves.” This name appears to have been given to\r\nvarious savage races in different parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[2800] There were races of the Alani in Asia on the Caucasus, and in\r\nEurope on the Mæotis and the Euxine; but their precise geographical\r\nposition is not clearly ascertained.\r\n\r\n[2801] The present Transylvania and Hungary.\r\n\r\n[2802] The name given in the age of Pliny to the range of mountains\r\nextending around Bohemia, and through Moravia into Hungary.\r\n\r\n[2803] Its ruins are still to be seen on the south bank of the Danube\r\nnear Haimburg, between Deutsch-Altenburg and Petronell. The Roman fleet\r\nof the Danube, with the 14th legion, was originally established there.\r\n\r\n[2804] In Pliny’s time this migratory tribe seems to have removed to\r\nthe plains between the Lower Theiss and the mountains of Transylvania,\r\nfrom which places they had expelled the Dacians.\r\n\r\n[2805] The Lower Theiss.\r\n\r\n[2806] Now the river Mark, Maros, or Morava.\r\n\r\n[2807] The name of the two streams now known as the Dora Baltea and\r\nDora Riparia, both of which fall into the Po. This passage appears to\r\nbe in a mutilated state.\r\n\r\n[2808] A chief of the Quadi; who, as we learn from Tacitus, was made\r\nking of the Suevi by Germanicus, A.D. 19. Being afterwards expelled by\r\nhis nephews Vangio and Sido, he received from the emperor Claudius a\r\nsettlement in Pannonia. Tacitus gives the name of Suevia to the whole\r\nof the east of Germany from the Danube to the Baltic.\r\n\r\n[2809] According to Hardouin, Pliny here speaks of the other side of\r\nthe mountainous district called Higher Hungary, facing the Danube and\r\nextending from the river Theiss to the Morava.\r\n\r\n[2810] This, according to Sillig, is the real meaning of _a desertis_\r\nhere, the distance being measured from the Danube, and not between\r\nthe Vistula and the wilds of Sarmatia. The reading “four thousand” is\r\nprobably corrupt, but it seems more likely than that of 404 miles,\r\nadopted by Littré, in his French translation.\r\n\r\n[2811] Placed by Forbiger near Lake Burmasaka, or near Islama.\r\n\r\n[2812] The Dniester. The mountains of Macrocremnus, or the “Great\r\nHeights,” seem not to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[2813] According to Hardouin, the modern name of this island is Tandra.\r\n\r\n[2814] Now called the Teligul, east of the Tyra or Dniester.\r\n\r\n[2815] Now called Sasik Beregen, according to Brotier.\r\n\r\n[2816] The modern Gulf of Berezen, according to Brotier.\r\n\r\n[2817] Probably the modern Okzakow.\r\n\r\n[2818] The modern Dnieper. It also retains its ancient name of\r\nBorysthenes.\r\n\r\n[2819] We learn from Strabo that the name of this town was Olbia, and\r\nthat from being founded by the Milesians, it received the name of\r\nMiletopolis. According to Brotier, the modern Zapurouski occupies its\r\nsite, between the mouths of the river Buzuluk.\r\n\r\n[2820] This was adjacent to the strip of land called “Dromos\r\nAchilleos,” or the ‘race-course of Achilles.’ It is identified by\r\ngeographers with the little island of Zmievoi or Oulan Adassi, the\r\n‘Serpents Island.’ It was said that it was to this spot that Thetis\r\ntransported the body of Achilles. By some it was made the abode of the\r\nshades of the blest, where Achilles and other heroes of fable were the\r\njudges of the dead.\r\n\r\n[2821] A narrow strip of land N.W. of the Crimea and south of the mouth\r\nof the Dnieper, running nearly due west and east. It is now divided\r\ninto two parts called Kosa Tendra and Kosa Djarilgatch. Achilles was\r\nsaid to have instituted games here.\r\n\r\n[2822] According to Hardouin, the Siraci occupied a portion of the\r\npresent Podolia and Ukraine, and the Tauri the modern Bessarabia.\r\n\r\n[2823] According to Herodotus, this region, called Hylæa, lay to the\r\neast of the Borysthenes. It seems uncertain whether there are now any\r\ntraces of this ancient woodland; some of the old maps however give the\r\nname of the “Black Forest” to this district. From the statements of\r\nmodern travellers, the woody country does not commence till the river\r\nDon has been reached. The district of Hylæa has been identified by\r\ngeographers with the great plain of Janboylouk in the steppe of the\r\nNogai.\r\n\r\n[2824] For Enœchadlæ, Hardouin suggests that we should read _Inde\r\nHylæi_, “hence the inhabitants are called by the name of Hylæi.”\r\n\r\n[2825] The Panticapes is usually identified with the modern Somara, but\r\nperhaps without sufficient grounds. It is more probably the Kouskawoda.\r\n\r\n[2826] The Nomades or _wandering_, from the Georgi or _agricultural_\r\nScythians.\r\n\r\n[2827] The Acesinus does not appear to have been identified by modern\r\ngeographers.\r\n\r\n[2828] Above called Olbiopolis or Miletopolis.\r\n\r\n[2829] The Bog or Boug. Flowing parallel with the Borysthenes or\r\nDnieper, it discharged itself into the Euxine at the town of Olbia, at\r\nno great distance from the mouth of the Borysthenes.\r\n\r\n[2830] Probably meaning the mouth or point at which the river\r\ndischarges itself into the sea.\r\n\r\n[2831] The modern Gulf of Negropoli or Perekop, on the west side of the\r\nChersonesus Taurica or Crimea.\r\n\r\n[2832] Forming the present isthmus of Perekop, which divides the Sea of\r\nPerekop from the Sea of Azof.\r\n\r\n[2833] Called by Herodotus Hypacyris, and by later writers Carcinites.\r\nIt is generally supposed to be the same as the small stream now known\r\nas the Kalantchak.\r\n\r\n[2834] Hardouin says that the city of Carcine has still retained its\r\nname, but changed its site. More modern geographers however are of\r\nopinion that nothing can be determined with certainty as to its site.\r\nOf the site also of Navarum nothing seems to be known.\r\n\r\n[2835] Or Buces or Byce. This is really a gulf, _almost_ enclosed, at\r\nthe end of the Sea of Azof. Strabo gives a more full description of it\r\nunder the name of the _Sapra Limnè_, “the Putrid Lake,” by which name\r\nit is still called, in Russian, _Sibaché_ or Sivaché Moré. It is a vast\r\nlagoon, covered with water when an east wind blows the water of the Sea\r\nof Azof into it, but at other times a tract of slime and mud, sending\r\nforth pestilential vapours.\r\n\r\n[2836] It is rather a ridge of sand, that _almost_ separates it from\r\nthe waters of the gulf.\r\n\r\n[2837] This river has not been identified by modern geographers.\r\n\r\n[2838] According to Herodotus the Gerrhus or Gerrus fell into the\r\nHypacaris; which must be understood to be, not the Kalantchak, but the\r\nOutlouk. It is probably now represented by the Moloschnijawoda, which\r\nforms a shallow lake or marsh at its mouth.\r\n\r\n[2839] It is most probable that the Pacyris, mentioned above, the\r\nHypacaris, and the Carcinites, were various names for the same river,\r\ngenerally supposed, as stated above, to be the small stream of\r\nKalantchak.\r\n\r\n[2840] Now the Crimea.\r\n\r\n[2841] It does not appear that the site of any of these cities has been\r\nidentified. Charax was a general name for a fortified town.\r\n\r\n[2842] Mentioned again by Pliny in B. vi. c. 7. Solinus says that in\r\norder to repel avarice, the Satarchæ prohibited the use of gold and\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n[2843] On the site of the modern Perekop, more commonly called Orkapi.\r\n\r\n[2844] Or Chersonesus of the Heracleans. The town of Kosleve or\r\nEupatoria is supposed to stand on its site.\r\n\r\n[2845] After the conquest of Mithridates, when the whole of these\r\nregions fell into the hands of the Romans.\r\n\r\n[2846] The modern Felenk-burun. So called from the Parthenos or Virgin\r\nDiana or Artemis, whose temple stood on its heights, in which human\r\nsacrifices were offered to the goddess.\r\n\r\n[2847] Supposed to be the same as the now-famed port of Balaklava.\r\n\r\n[2848] The modern Aia-burun, the great southern headland of the Crimea.\r\nAccording to Plutarch, it was called by the natives Brixaba, which,\r\nlike the name Criumetopon, meant the “Ram’s Head.”\r\n\r\n[2849] Now Kerempi, a promontory of Paphlagonia in Asia Minor. Strabo\r\nconsiders this promontory and that of Criumetopon as dividing the\r\nEuxine into two seas.\r\n\r\n[2850] According to Strabo, the sea-line of the Tauric Chersonesus,\r\nafter leaving the port of the Symboli, extended 125 miles, as far as\r\nTheodosia. Pliny would here seem to make it rather greater.\r\n\r\n[2851] The modern Kaffa occupies its site. The sites of many of the\r\nplaces here mentioned appear not to be known at the present day.\r\n\r\n[2852] The modern Kertsch, situate on a hill at the very mouth of the\r\nCimmerian Bosporus, or Straits of Enikale or Kaffa, opposite the town\r\nof Phanagoria in Asia.\r\n\r\n[2853] In C. 24 of the present Book. Clark identifies the town of\r\nCimmerium with the modern Temruk, Forbiger with Eskikrimm. It is again\r\nmentioned in B. vi. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2854] He alludes here, not to the Strait so called, but to the\r\nPeninsula bordering upon it, upon which the modern town of Kertsch is\r\nsituate, and which projects from the larger Peninsula of the Crimea, as\r\na sort of excrescence on its eastern side.\r\n\r\n[2855] Probably Hermes or Mercury was its tutelar divinity: its site\r\nappears to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[2856] Probably meaning the Straits or passage connecting the Lake\r\nMæotis with the Euxine. The fertile district of the Cimmerian Bosporus\r\nwas at one time the granary of Greece, especially Athens, which\r\nimported thence annually 400,000 medimni of corn.\r\n\r\n[2857] A town so called on the Isthmus of Perekop, from a τάφρος or\r\ntrench, which was cut across the isthmus at this point.\r\n\r\n[2858] Lomonossov, in his History of Russia, says that these people\r\nwere the same as the Sclavoni: but that one meaning of the name\r\n‘Slavane’ being “a boaster,” the Greeks gave them the corresponding\r\nappellation of Auchetæ, from the word αὐχὴ, which signifies “boasting.”\r\n\r\n[2859] Of the Geloni, called by Virgil “picti,” or “painted,” nothing\r\ncertain seems to be known: they are associated by Herodotus with the\r\nBudini, supposed to belong to the Slavic family by Schafarik. In B. iv.\r\nc. 108, 109, of his History, Herodotus gives a very particular account\r\nof the Budini, who had a city built entirely of wood, the name of which\r\nwas Gelonus. The same author also assigns to the Geloni a Greek origin.\r\n\r\n[2860] The Agathyrsi are placed by Herodotus near the upper course of\r\nthe river Maris, in the S.E. of Dacia or the modern Transylvania. Pliny\r\nhowever seems here to assign them a different locality.\r\n\r\n[2861] Also called “Assedones” and “Issedones.” It has been suggested\r\nby modern geographers that their locality must be assigned to the east\r\nof Ichim, on the steppe of the central horde of the Kirghiz, and that\r\nof the Arimaspi on the northern declivity of the chain of the Altaï.\r\n\r\n[2862] Now the Don.\r\n\r\n[2863] Most probably these mountains were a western branch of the\r\nUralian chain.\r\n\r\n[2864] From the Greek πτεροφορὸς, “wing-bearing” or “feather-bearing.”\r\n\r\n[2865] This legendary race was said to dwell in the regions beyond\r\nBoreas, or the northern wind, which issued from the Riphæan mountains,\r\nthe name of which was derived from ῥιπαὶ or “hurricanes” issuing from\r\na cavern, and which these heights warded off from the Hyperboreans\r\nand sent to more southern nations. Hence they never felt the northern\r\nblasts, and enjoyed a life of supreme happiness and undisturbed repose.\r\n“Here,” says Humboldt, “are the first views of a natural science which\r\nexplains the distribution of heat and the difference of climates by\r\nlocal causes—by the direction of the winds—the proximity of the sun,\r\nand the action of a moist or saline principle.”—_Asie Centrale_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[2866] Pindar says, in the “Pythia,” x. 56, “The Muse is no stranger\r\nto their manners. The dances of girls and the sweet melody of the lyre\r\nand pipe resound on every side, and wreathing their locks with the\r\nglistening bay, they feast joyously. For this sacred race there is\r\nno doom of sickness or of disease; but they live apart from toil and\r\nbattles, undisturbed by the exacting Nemesis.”\r\n\r\n[2867] Hardouin remarks that Pomponius Mela, who asserts that the sun\r\nrises here at the vernal and sets at the autumnal equinox, is right in\r\nhis position, and that Pliny is incorrect in his assertion. The same\r\ncommentator thinks that Pliny can have hardly intended to censure Mela,\r\nto whose learning he had been so much indebted for his geographical\r\ninformation, by applying to him the epithet “imperitus,” ‘ignorant’ or\r\n‘unskilled’; he therefore suggests that the proper reading here is,\r\n“ut non imperiti dixere,” “as some by no means ignorant persons have\r\nasserted.”\r\n\r\n[2868] The Attacori are also mentioned in B. vi. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[2869] Sillig omits the word “non” here, in which case the reading\r\nwould be, “Those writers who place them anywhere but, &c.;” it is\r\ndifficult to see with what meaning.\r\n\r\n[2870] Herodotus, B. iv., states to this effect, and after him,\r\nPomponius Mela, B. iii. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[2871] These islands, or rather rocks, are now known as Fanari, and lie\r\nat the entrance of the Straits of Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[2872] From σὺν and πληγὴ, “a striking together.” Tournefort has\r\nexplained the ancient story of these islands running together, by\r\nremarking that each of them consists of one craggy island, but that\r\nwhen the sea is disturbed the water covers the lower parts, so as to\r\nmake the different points of each resemble isolated rocks. They are\r\nunited to the mainland by a kind of isthmus, and appear as islands only\r\nwhen it is inundated in stormy weather.\r\n\r\n[2873] Upon which the city of Apollonia (now Sizeboli), mentioned in C.\r\n18 of the present Book, was situate.\r\n\r\n[2874] So called because it was dedicated by Lucullus in the Capitol.\r\nIt was thirty cubits in height.\r\n\r\n[2875] In C. 24 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2876] Mentioned in the last Chapter as the “Island of Achilles.”\r\n\r\n[2877] From the Greek μακαρῶν, “(The island) of the Blest.” It was also\r\ncalled the “Island of the Heroes.”\r\n\r\n[2878] Meaning all the inland or Mediterranean seas.\r\n\r\n[2879] As the whole of Pliny’s description of the northern shores\r\nof Europe is replete with difficulties and obscurities, we cannot\r\ndo better than transcribe the learned remarks of M. Parisot, the\r\nGeographical Editor of Ajasson’s Edition, in reference to this subject.\r\nHe says, “Before entering on the discussion of this portion of Pliny’s\r\ngeography, let us here observe, once for all, that we shall not remark\r\nas worthy of our notice all those ridiculous hypotheses which could\r\nonly take their rise in ignorance, precipitation, or a love of the\r\nmarvellous. We shall decline then to recognize the Doffrefelds in\r\nthe mountains of Sevo, the North Cape in the Promontory of Rubeas,\r\nand the Sea of Greenland in the Cronian Sea. The absurdity of these\r\nsuppositions is proved by—I. The impossibility of the ancients ever\r\nmaking their way to these distant coasts without the aid of large\r\nvessels, the compass, and others of those appliances, aided by which\r\nEuropean skill finds the greatest difficulty in navigating those\r\ndistant seas. II. The immense lacunæ which would be found to exist in\r\nthe descriptions of these distant seas and shores: for not a word do\r\nwe find about those numerous archipelagos which are found scattered\r\nthroughout the North Sea, not a word about Iceland, nor about the\r\nnumberless seas and fiords on the coast of Norway. III. The absence of\r\nall remarks upon the local phænomena of these spots. The North Cape\r\nbelongs to the second polar climate, the longest day there being two\r\nmonths and a half. Is it likely that navigators would have omitted to\r\nmention this remarkable phænomenon, well known to the Romans by virtue\r\nof their astronomical theories, but one with which practically they had\r\nnever made themselves acquainted?—The only geographers who here merit\r\nour notice are those who are of opinion that in some of the coasts or\r\nislands here mentioned Pliny describes the Scandinavian Peninsula,\r\nand in others the Coast of Finland. The first question then is, to\r\nwhat point Pliny first carries us? It is evident that from the Black\r\nSea he transports himself on a sudden to the shores of the Baltic,\r\nthus passing over at a single leap a considerable space filled with\r\nnations and unknown deserts. The question then is, what line has he\r\nfollowed? Supposing our author had had before his eyes a modern map,\r\nthe imaginary line which he would have drawn in making this transition\r\nwould have been from Odessa to the Kurisch-Haff. In this direction the\r\nbreadth across Europe is contracted to a space, between the two seas,\r\nnot more than 268 leagues in length. A very simple mode of reasoning\r\nwill conclusively prove that Pliny has deviated little if anything\r\nfrom this route. If he fails to state in precise terms upon what point\r\nof the shores of the Baltic he alights after leaving the Riphæan\r\nmountains, his enumeration of the rivers which discharge themselves\r\ninto that sea, and with which he concludes his account of Germany, will\r\nsupply us with the requisite information, at all events in great part.\r\nIn following his description of the coast, we find mention made of\r\nthe following rivers, the Guttalus, the Vistula, the Elbe, the Weser,\r\nthe Ems, the Rhine, and the Meuse. The five last mentioned follow in\r\ntheir natural order, from east to west, as was to be expected in a\r\ndescription starting from the east of Europe for its western extremity\r\nand the shores of Cadiz. We have a right to conclude then that the\r\nGuttalus was to the east of the Vistula. As we shall now endeavour to\r\nshow, this river was no other than the Alle, a tributary of the Pregel,\r\nwhich the Romans probably, in advancing from west to east, considered\r\nas the principal stream, from the circumstance that they met with it,\r\nbefore coming to the larger river. The Pregel after being increased\r\nby the waters of the Alle or Guttalus falls into the Frisch-Haff,\r\nabout one degree further west than the Kurisch-Haff. It may however\r\nbe here remarked, Why not find a river more to the east, the Niemen,\r\nfor instance, or the Duna, to be represented by the Guttalus? The\r\nNiemen in especial would suit in every respect equally well, because\r\nit discharges itself into the Kurisch-Haff. This conjecture however\r\nis incapable of support, when we reflect that the ancients were\r\nundoubtedly acquainted with some points of the coast to the east of\r\nthe mouth of the Guttalus, but which, according to the system followed\r\nby our author, would form part of the Continent of Asia. These points\r\nare, 1st. The Cape Lytarmis (mentioned by Pliny, B. vi. c. 4). 2ndly.\r\nThe mouth of the river Carambucis (similarly mentioned by him), and\r\n3rdly, a little to the east of Cape Lytarmis, the mouth of the Tanais.\r\nThe name of Cape Lytarmis suggests to us Lithuania, and probably\r\nrepresents Domess-Ness in Courland; the Carambucis can be no other\r\nthan the Niemen; while the Tanais, upon which so many authors, ancient\r\nand modern, have exhausted their conjectures, from confounding it with\r\nthe Southern Tanais which falls into the Sea of Azof, is evidently the\r\nsame as the Dwina or Western Duna. This is established incontrovertibly\r\nboth by its geographical position (the mouth of the Dwina being only\r\nfifty leagues to the east of Domess-Ness) and the identity evidently\r\nof the names Dwina and Tanais. Long since, Leibnitz was the first to\r\nremark the presence of the radical _T. n_, or _D. n_, either with or\r\nwithout a vowel, in the names of the great rivers of Eastern Europe;\r\nDanapris or Dnieper, Danaster or Dniester, Danube (in German Donau, in\r\nHungarian Duna), Tanais or Don, for example; all which rivers however\r\ndischarge themselves into the Black Sea. There can be little doubt then\r\nof the identity of the Duna with the Tanais, it being the only body of\r\nwater in these vast countries which bears a name resembling the initial\r\n_Tan_, or _Tn_, and at the same time belongs to the basin of the\r\nBaltic. We are aware, it is true, that the White Sea receives a river\r\nDwina, which is commonly called the Northern Dwina, but there can be no\r\nreal necessity to be at the trouble of combating the opinion that this\r\nriver is identical with the Northern Tanais. As the result then of our\r\ninvestigations, it is at the eastern extremity of the Frisch-Haff and\r\nnear the mouth of the Pregel, that we would place the point at which\r\nPliny sets out. As for the Riphæan mountains, they have never existed\r\nanywhere but in the head of the geographers from whom our author drew\r\nhis materials. From the mountains of Ural and Poias, which Pliny could\r\nnot possibly have in view, seeing that they lie in a meridian as\r\neastern as the Caspian Sea, the traveller has to proceed 600 leagues to\r\nthe south-west without meeting with any chains of mountains or indeed\r\nconsiderable elevations.”\r\n\r\n[2880] It is pretty clear that he refers to the numerous islands\r\nscattered over the face of the Baltic Sea, such as Dago, Oesel,\r\nGothland, and Aland.\r\n\r\n[2881] The old reading here was Bannomanna, which Dupinet would\r\ntranslate by the modern Bornholm. Parisot considers that the modern\r\nRuna, a calcareous rock covered with vegetable earth, in the vicinity\r\nof Domess-Ness, is the place indicated.\r\n\r\n[2882] It has been suggested by Brotier that Pliny here refers to the\r\nIcy Sea, but it is more probable that he refers to the north-eastern\r\npart of the Baltic, which was looked upon by the ancients us forming\r\npart of the open sea.\r\n\r\n[2883] With reference to these divisions of land and sea, a subject\r\nwhich is involved in the greatest obscurity, Parisot states it as his\r\nopinion that the Amalchian or Icy Sea is that portion of the Baltic\r\nwhich extends from Cape Rutt to Cape Grinea, while on the other hand\r\nthe Cronian Sea comprehends all the gulfs which lie to the east of\r\nCape Rutt, such as the Haff, the gulfs of Stettin and Danzic, the\r\nFrisch-Haff, and the Kurisch-Haff. He also thinks that the name of\r\n‘Cronian’ originally belonged only to that portion of the Baltic which\r\nwashes the coast of Courland, but that travellers gradually applied\r\nthe term to the whole of the sea. He is also of opinion that the word\r\n“Cronium” owes its origin to the Teutonic and Danish adjective _groen_\r\nor “green.” The extreme verdure which characterizes the islands of the\r\nDanish archipelago has given to the piece of water which separates\r\nthe islands of Falster and Moen the name of Groensund, and it is far\r\nfrom improbable that the same epithet was given to the Pomeranian and\r\nPrussian Seas, which the Romans would be not unlikely to call ‘Gronium’\r\nor ‘Cronium fretum,’ or ‘Cronium mare.’ In the name ‘Parapanisus’ he\r\nalso discovers a resemblance to that of modern Pomerania.\r\n\r\n[2884] Upon this Parisot remarks that on leaving Cape Rutt, at a\r\ndistance of about twenty-five leagues in a straight line, we come\r\nto the island of Funen or Fyen, commonly called Fionia, the most\r\nconsiderable of the Danish archipelago next to Zealand, and which lying\r\nbetween the two Belts, the Greater and the Smaller, may very probably\r\nfrom that circumstance have obtained the name of Baltia. Brotier takes\r\nBaltia to be no other than Nova Zembla—so conflicting are the opinions\r\nof commentators!\r\n\r\n[2885] Parisot suggests that under this name may possibly lie concealed\r\nthat of the modern island of Zealand or Seeland, and that it may have\r\nborne on the side of it next to the Belt the name of Baltseeland,\r\neasily corrupted by the Greeks into Basilia.\r\n\r\n[2886] Brotier takes these to be the islands of Aloo, and Bieloi or\r\nOstrow, at the mouth of the river Paropanisus, which he considers to\r\nbe the same as the Obi. Parisot on the other hand is of opinion that\r\nislands of the Baltic are here referred to; that from the resemblance\r\nof the name Oönæ to the Greek ὠὸν, “an egg,” the story that the natives\r\nsubsisted on the eggs of birds was formed; that not improbably the\r\ngroup of the Hippopodes resembled the shape of a horse-shoe, from which\r\nthe story mentioned by Pliny took its rise; and that the Fanesii (or,\r\nas the reading here has it, the Panotii, “all-ears”) wore their hair\r\nvery short, from which circumstance their ears appeared to be of a\r\nlarger size than usual.\r\n\r\n[2887] Tacitus speaks of three great groups of the German tribes, the\r\nIngævones forming the first thereof, and consisting of those which\r\ndwelt on the margin of the ocean, the Hermiones in the interior, and\r\nthe Istævones in the east and south of Germany. We shall presently find\r\nthat Pliny adds two groups, the Vandili as the fourth, and the Peucini\r\nand Basternæ as the fifth. This classification however is thought to\r\noriginate in a mistake, for Zeuss has satisfactorily shown that the\r\nVandili belonged to the Hermiones, and that Peucini and Basternæ are\r\nonly names of individual tribes and not of groups of tribes.\r\n\r\n[2888] Brotier and other geographers are of opinion that by this name\r\nthe chain of the Doffrefeld mountains is meant; but this cannot be the\r\ncase if we suppose with Parisot that Pliny here returns south from the\r\nScandinavian islands and takes his departure from Cape Rutt in the\r\nterritory of the Ingævones. Still, it is quite impossible to say what\r\nmountains he would designate under the name of Sevo. Parisot suggests\r\nthat it is a form of the compound word “seevohner,” “inhabitants of the\r\nsea,” and that it is a general name for the elevated lands along the\r\nmargin of the sea-shore.\r\n\r\n[2889] Parisot supposes that under this name the isle of Funen is\r\nmeant, but it is more generally thought that Norway and Sweden are thus\r\ndesignated, as that peninsula was generally looked upon as an island by\r\nthe ancients. The Codanian Gulf was the sea to the east of the Cimbrian\r\nChersonesus or Jutland, filled with the islands which belong to the\r\nmodern kingdom of Denmark. It was therefore the southern part of the\r\nBaltic.\r\n\r\n[2890] By Eningia Hardouin thinks that the country of modern Finland\r\nis meant. Poinsinet thinks that under the name are included Ingria,\r\nLivonia, and Courland; while Parisot seems inclined to be of opinion\r\nthat under this name the island of Zealand is meant, a village of\r\nwhich, about three-fourths of a league from the western coast,\r\naccording to him, still bears the name of Heinïnge.\r\n\r\n[2891] Parisot is of opinion that the Venedi, also called Vinidæ and\r\nVindili, were of Sclavish origin, and situate on the shores of the\r\nBaltic. He remarks that this people, in the fifth century, founded\r\nin Pomerania, when quitted by the Goths, a kingdom, the chiefs of\r\nwhich styled themselves the Konjucs of Vinland. Their name is also\r\nto be found in Venden, a Russian town in the government of Riga, in\r\nWindenburg in Courland, and in Wenden in the circle of the Grand Duchy\r\nof Mecklenburg Schwerin.\r\n\r\n[2892] Parisot remarks that these two peoples were probably only tribes\r\nof the Venedi.\r\n\r\n[2893] Parisot feels convinced that Pliny is speaking here of the\r\nGulf of Travemunde, the island of Femeren, and then of the gulf\r\nwhich extends from that island to Kiel, where the Eider separates\r\nHolstein from Jutland. On the other hand, Hardouin thinks that by the\r\nGulf of Cylipenus the Gulf of Riga is meant, and that Latris is the\r\nmodern island of Oësel. But, as Parisot justly remarks, to put this\r\nconstruction on Pliny’s language is to invert the order in which he has\r\nhitherto proceeded, evidently from east to west.\r\n\r\n[2894] The modern Cape of Skagen on the north of Jutland.\r\n\r\n[2895] When Drusus held the command in Germany, as we learn from\r\nStrabo, B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2896] It is generally agreed that this is the modern island of\r\nBorkhum, at the mouth of the river Amaiius or Ems.\r\n\r\n[2897] To a bean, from which (_faba_) the island had its name of\r\nFabaria. In confirmation of this Hardouin states, that in his time\r\nthere was a tower still standing there which was called by the natives\r\n_Het boon huys_, “the bean house.”\r\n\r\n[2898] From the word _gles_ or _glas_, which primarily means ‘glass,’\r\nand then figuratively “amber.” Probably Œland and Gothland. They will\r\nbe found again mentioned in the Thirtieth Chapter of the present Book.\r\nSee p. 351.\r\n\r\n[2899] Now the Scheldt.\r\n\r\n[2900] In a straight line, of course. Parisot is of opinion that in\r\nforming this estimate Agrippa began at the angle formed by the river\r\nPiave in lat. 46° 4′, measuring thence to Cape Rubeas (now Rutt) in\r\nlat. 54° 25′. This would give 8° 21′, to which, if we add some twenty\r\nleagues for obliquity or difference of longitude, the total would make\r\nexactly the distance here mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2901] As Parisot remarks, it is totally impossible to conceive the\r\nsource of such an erroneous conclusion as this. Some readings make the\r\namount 248, others 268.\r\n\r\n[2902] As already mentioned, Zeuss has satisfactorily shown that the\r\nVandili or Vindili properly belonged to the Hermiones. Tacitus mentions\r\nbut three groups of the German nations; the Ingævones on the ocean, the\r\nHermiones in the interior, and the Istævones in the east and south of\r\nGermany. The Vandili, a Gothic race, dwelt originally on the northern\r\ncoast of Germany, but afterwards settled north of the Marcomanni on the\r\nRiesengebirge. They subsequently appeared in Dacia and Pannonia, and in\r\nthe beginning of the fifth century invaded Spain. Under Genseric they\r\npassed over into Africa, and finally took and plundered Rome in A.D.\r\n455. Their kingdom was finally destroyed by Belisarius.\r\n\r\n[2903] It is supposed that the Burgundiones were a Gothic people\r\ndwelling in the country between the rivers Viadus and Vistula, though\r\nAmmianus Marcellinus declares them to have been of pure Roman origin.\r\nHow they came into the country of the Upper Maine in the south-west\r\nof Germany in A.D. 289, historians have found themselves at a loss\r\nto inform us. It is not improbable that the two peoples were not\r\nidentical, and that the similarity of their name arose only from the\r\ncircumstance that they both resided in “burgi” or burghs. See Gibbon,\r\niii. 99. _Bohn’s Ed._\r\n\r\n[2904] The Varini dwelt on the right bank of the Albis or Elbe, north\r\nof the Langobardi. Ptolemy however, who seems to mention them as the\r\nAvarini, speaks of them as dwelling near the sources of the Vistula, on\r\nthe site of the present Cracow. See Gibbon, iv. 225. _Bohn’s Ed._\r\n\r\n[2905] Nothing whatever is known of the locality of this people.\r\n\r\n[2906] They are also called in history Gothi, Gothones, Gotones and\r\nGutæ. According to Pytheas of Marseilles (as mentioned by Pliny, B.\r\nxxxvii. c. 2), they dwelt on the coasts of the Baltic, in the vicinity\r\nof what is now called the Fritsch-Haff. Tacitus also refers to the\r\nsame district, though he does not speak of them as inhabiting the\r\ncoast. Ptolemy again speaks of them as dwelling on the east of the\r\nVistula, and to the south of the Venedi. The later form of their name,\r\n_Gothi_, does not occur till the time of Caracalla. Their native name\r\nwas Gutthinda. They are first spoken of as a powerful nation at the\r\nbeginning of the third century, when we find them mentioned as ‘Getæ,’\r\nfrom the circumstance of their having occupied the countries formerly\r\ninhabited by the Sarmatian Getæ. The formidable attacks made by this\r\npeople, divided into the nations of the Ostrogoths and Visigoths, upon\r\nthe Roman power during its decline, are too well known to every reader\r\nof Gibbon to require further notice.\r\n\r\n[2907] The inhabitants of Chersonesus Cimbrica, the modern peninsula\r\nof Jutland. It seems doubtful whether these Cimbri were a Germanic\r\nnation or a Celtic tribe, as also whether they were the same race\r\nwhose numerous hordes successively defeated six Roman armies, and were\r\nfinally conquered by C. Marius, B.C. 101, in the Campi Raudii. The more\r\ngeneral impression, however, entertained by historians, is that they\r\nwere a Celtic or Gallic and not a Germanic nation. The name is said to\r\nhave signified “robbers.” See Gibbon, i. 273, iii. 365. _Bohn’s Ed._\r\n\r\n[2908] The Teutoni or Teutones dwelt on the coasts of the Baltic,\r\nadjacent to the territory of the Cimbri. Their name, though belonging\r\noriginally to a single nation or tribe, came to be afterwards applied\r\ncollectively to the whole people of Germany. See Gibbon, iii. 139.\r\n_Bohn’s Ed._\r\n\r\n[2909] Also called Cauchi, Cauci, and Cayci, a German tribe to the east\r\nof the Frisians, between the rivers Ems and Elbe. The modern Oldenburg\r\nand Hanover are supposed to pretty nearly represent the country of the\r\nChauci. In B. xvi. c. 1. 2, will be found a further account of them by\r\nPliny, who had visited their country, at least that part of it which\r\nlay on the sea-coast. They are mentioned for the last time in the third\r\ncentury, when they had extended so far south and west that they are\r\nspoken of as living on the banks of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n[2910] Mentioned by Tacitus as dwelling in the east and south of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n[2911] It has been suggested by Titzius that the words “quorum Cimbri,”\r\n“to whom the Cimbri belong,” are an interpolation; which is not\r\nimprobable, or at least that the word “Cimbri” has been substituted for\r\nsome other name.\r\n\r\n[2912] This appears to be properly the collective name of a great\r\nnumber of the German tribes, who were of a migratory mode of life, and\r\nspoken of in opposition to the more settled tribes, who went under the\r\ngeneral name of Ingævones. Cæsar speaks of them as dwelling east of the\r\nUbii and Sygambri, and west of the Cherusci. Strabo makes them extend\r\nin an easterly direction beyond the Albis or Elbe, and southerly as far\r\nas the sources of the Danube. Tacitus gives the name of Suevia to the\r\nwhole of the east of Germany, from the Danube to the Baltic. The name\r\nof the modern Suabia is derived from a body of adventurers from various\r\nGerman tribes, who assumed the name of Suevi in consequence of their\r\nnot possessing any other appellation.\r\n\r\n[2913] A large and powerful tribe of Germany, which occupied the\r\nextensive tract of country between the mountains in the north-west of\r\nBohemia and the Roman Wall in the south-west, which formed the boundary\r\nof the Agri Decumates. On the east they bordered on the Narisci, on\r\nthe north-east on the Cherusci, and on the north-west on the Chatti.\r\nThere is little doubt that they originally formed part of the Suevi.\r\nAt a later period they spread in a north-easterly direction, taking\r\npossession of the north-western part of Bohemia and the country about\r\nthe sources of the Maine and Saale, that is, the part of Franconia as\r\nfar as Kissingen and the south-western part of the kingdom of Saxony.\r\nThe name Hermunduri is thought by some to signify highlanders, and to\r\nbe a compound of _Her_ or _Ar_, “high,” and _Mund_, “man.”\r\n\r\n[2914] One of the great tribes of Germany, which rose to importance\r\nafter the decay of the power of the Cherusci. It is thought by\r\nethnographers that their name is still preserved in the word “Hessen.”\r\nThey formed the chief tribe of the Hermiones here mentioned, and\r\nare described by Cæsar as belonging to the Suevi, though Tacitus\r\ndistinguishes them, and no German tribe in fact occupied more\r\npermanently its original locality than the Chatti. Their original abode\r\nseems to have extended from the Westerwald in the west to the Saale in\r\nFranconia, and from the river Maine in the south as far as the sources\r\nof the Elison and the Weser, so that they occupied exactly the modern\r\ncountry of Hessen, including perhaps a portion of the north-west of\r\nBavaria. See Gibbon, vol. iii. 99. _Bohn’s Ed._\r\n\r\n[2915] The Cherusci were the most celebrated of all the German tribes,\r\nand are mentioned by Cæsar as of the same importance as the Suevi,\r\nfrom whom they were separated by the Silva Bacensis. There is some\r\ndifficulty in stating their exact locality, but it is generally\r\nsupposed that their country extended from the Visurgis or Weser in the\r\nwest to the Albis or Elbe in the east, and from Melibocus in the north\r\nto the neighbourhood of the Sudeti in the south, so that the Chamavi\r\nand Langobardi were their northern neighbours, the Chatti the western,\r\nthe Hermunduri the southern, and the Silingi and Semnones their eastern\r\nneighbours. This tribe, under their chief Arminius or Hermann, forming\r\na confederation with many smaller tribes in A.D. 9, completely defeated\r\nthe Romans in the famous battle of the Teutoburg Forest. In later times\r\nthey were conquered by the Chatti, so that Ptolemy speaks of them\r\nonly as a small tribe on the south of the Hartz mountain. Their name\r\nafterwards appears, in the beginning of the fourth century, in the\r\nconfederation of the Franks.\r\n\r\n[2916] The Peucini are mentioned here, as also by Tacitus, as identical\r\nwith the Basternæ. As already mentioned, supposing them to be names\r\nfor distinct nations, they must be taken as only names of individual\r\ntribes, and not of groups of tribes. It is generally supposed that\r\ntheir first settlements in Sarmatia were in the highlands between the\r\nTheiss and the March, whence they passed onward to the lower Danube,\r\nas far as its mouth, where a portion of them, settling in the island\r\nof Peuce, obtained the name of Peucini. In the later geographers we\r\nfind them settled between the Tyrus or Dniester, and the Borysthenes or\r\nDnieper, the Peucini remaining at the mouth of the Danube.\r\n\r\n[2917] According to Parisot, the Guttalus is the same as the Alle, a\r\ntributary of the Pregel. Cluver thinks that it is the same as the Oder.\r\nOther writers again consider it the same as the Pregel.\r\n\r\n[2918] Or Elbe.\r\n\r\n[2919] Now the Weser.\r\n\r\n[2920] The modern Ems.\r\n\r\n[2921] The Meuse.\r\n\r\n[2922] The ‘Hercynia Silva,’ Hercynian Forest or Range, is very\r\ndifferently described by the writers of various ages. The earliest\r\nmention of it is by Aristotle. Judging from the accounts given by\r\nCæsar, Pomponius Mela, and Strabo, the ‘Hercynia Silva’ appears to\r\nhave been a general name for almost all the mountains of Southern\r\nand Central Germany, that is, from the sources of the Danube to\r\nTransylvania, comprising the Schwarzwald, Odenwald, Spessart,\r\nRhön, Thuringer Wald, the Hartz mountain (which seems in a great\r\nmeasure to have retained the ancient name), Raube Alp, Steigerwald,\r\nFichtelgebirge, Erzgebirge, and Riesengebirge. At a later period when\r\nthe mountains of Germany had become better known, the name was applied\r\nto the more limited range extending around Bohemia, and through Moravia\r\ninto Hungary.\r\n\r\n[2923] This island appears to have been formed by the bifurcation of\r\nthe Rhine, the northern branch of which enters the sea at Katwyck, a\r\nfew miles north of Leyden, by the Waal and the course of the Maas,\r\nafter it has received the Waal, and by the sea. The Waal or Vahalis\r\nseems to have undergone considerable changes, and the place of its\r\njunction with the Maas may have varied. Pliny makes the island nearly\r\n100 miles in length, which is about the distance from the fort of\r\nSchenkenschanz, where the first separation of the Rhine takes place,\r\nto the mouth of the Maas. The name of Batavia was no doubt the genuine\r\nname, which is still preserved in Betuwe, the name of a district at\r\nthe bifurcation of the Rhine and the Waal. The Canninefates, a people\r\nof the same race as the Batavi, also occupied the island, and as the\r\nBatavi seem to have been in the eastern part, it is supposed that the\r\nCanninefates occupied the western. They were subdued by Tiberius in the\r\nreign of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[2924] The Frisii or Frisones were one of the great tribes of\r\nnorth-western Germany, properly belonging to the group of the\r\nIngævones. They inhabited the country about Lake Flevo and other lakes,\r\nbetween the Rhine and the Ems, so as to be bounded on the south by the\r\nBructeri, and on the east by the Chauci. Tacitus distinguishes between\r\nthe Frisii Majores and Minores, and it is supposed that the latter\r\ndwelt on the east of the canal of Drusus in the north of Holland,\r\nand the former between the rivers Flevus and Amisia, that is, in the\r\ncountry which still bears the name of Friesland. The Chauci have been\r\npreviously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2925] The Frisiabones or Frisævones are again mentioned in C. 31 of\r\nthe present Book as a people of Gaul. In what locality they dwelt has\r\nnot been ascertained by historians.\r\n\r\n[2926] The Sturii are supposed to have inhabited the modern South\r\nHolland, while the Marsacii probably inhabited the island which the\r\nMeuse forms at its junction with the Rhine, at the modern Dortrecht in\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\n[2927] Supposed to be the site of the modern fortress of Briel, situate\r\nat the mouth of the Meuse.\r\n\r\n[2928] Probably the same as the modern Vlieland (thus partly retaining\r\nits ancient name), an island north of the Texel. The more ancient\r\nwriters speak of two main arms, into which the Rhine was divided on\r\nentering the territory of the Batavi, of which the one on the east\r\ncontinued to bear the name of Rhenus, while that on the west into which\r\nthe Masa, Maas or Meuse, flowed, was called Vahalis or Waal. After\r\nDrusus, B.C. 12, had connected the Flevo Lacus or Zuyder-Zee with\r\nthe Rhine by means of a canal, in forming which he probably made use\r\nof the bed of the Yssel, we find mention made of three mouths of the\r\nRhine. Of these the names, as given by Pliny, are, on the west, Helium\r\n(the Vahalis of other writers), in the centre Rhenus, and at the north\r\nFlevum; but at a later period we again find mention made of only two\r\nmouths.\r\n\r\n[2929] Britain was spoken of by some of the Greek writers as superior\r\nto all other islands in the world. Dionysius, in his Periegesis, says,\r\n“that no other islands whatsoever can claim equality with those of\r\nBritain.”\r\n\r\n[2930] Said to have been so called from the whiteness of its cliffs\r\nopposite the coast of Gaul.\r\n\r\n[2931] Afterwards called Bononia, the modern Boulogne. As D’Anville\r\nremarks, the distance here given by Pliny is far too great, whether\r\nwe measure to Dover or to Hythe; our author’s measurement however is\r\nprobably made to Rutupiæ (the modern Richborough), near Sandwich, where\r\nthe Romans had a fortified post, which was their landing-place when\r\ncrossing over from Gaul. This would make the distance given by Pliny\r\nnearer the truth, though still too much.\r\n\r\n[2932] Probably the Grampian range is here referred to.\r\n\r\n[2933] The people of South Wales.\r\n\r\n[2934] The Orkney islands were included under this name. Pomponius Mela\r\nand Ptolemy make them but thirty in number, while Solinus fixes their\r\nnumber at three only.\r\n\r\n[2935] Also called Æmodæ or Hæmodæ, most probably the islands now known\r\nas the Shetlands. Camden however and the older antiquarians refer the\r\nHæmodæ to the Baltic sea, considering them different from the Acmodæ\r\nhere mentioned, while Salmasius on the other hand considers the Acmodæ\r\nor Hæmodæ and the Hebrides as identical. Parisot remarks that off the\r\nWest Cape of the Isle of Skye and the Isle of North Uist, the nearest\r\nof the Hebrides to the Shetland islands, there is a vast gulf filled\r\nwith islands, which still bears the name of Mamaddy or Maddy, from\r\nwhich the Greeks may have easily derived the words Αἱ Μαδδαὶ, whence\r\nthe Latin Hæmodæ.\r\n\r\n[2936] The Isle of Anglesea.\r\n\r\n[2937] Most probably the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\n[2938] Camden and Gosselin (_Rech. sur la Géogr. des Anciens_) consider\r\nthat under this name is meant the island of Racklin, situate near the\r\nnorth-eastern extremity of Ireland. A Ricina is spoken of by Ptolemy,\r\nbut that island is one of the Hebrides.\r\n\r\n[2939] This Vectis is considered by Gosselin to be the same as the\r\nsmall island of White-Horn, situate at the entrance of the Bay of\r\nWigtown in Scotland. It must not be confounded with the more southern\r\nVectis, or Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\n[2940] According to Gosselin this is the island of Dalkey, at the\r\nentrance of Dublin Bay.\r\n\r\n[2941] Camden thinks that this is the same as Bardsey Island, at the\r\nsouth of the island of Anglesea, while Mannert and Gosselin think that\r\nit is the island of Lambay.\r\n\r\n[2942] According to Brotier these islands belong to the coast of\r\nBritanny, being the modern isles of Sian and Ushant.\r\n\r\n[2943] As already mentioned, he probably speaks of the islands of Œland\r\nand Gothland, and Ameland, called Austeravia or Actania, in which\r\n_glæsum_ or amber was found by the Roman soldiers. See p. 344.\r\n\r\n[2944] The opinions as to the identity of ancient Thule have been\r\nnumerous in the extreme. We may here mention six:—1. The common,\r\nand apparently the best founded opinion, that Thule is the island\r\nof Iceland. 2. That it is either the Ferroe group, or one of those\r\nislands. 3. The notion of Ortelius, Farnaby, and Schœnning, that it is\r\nidentical with Thylemark in Norway. 4. The opinion of Malte Brun, that\r\nthe continental portion of Denmark is meant thereby, a part of which\r\nis to the present day called Thy or Thyland. 5. The opinion of Rudbeck\r\nand of Calstron, borrowed originally from Procopius, that this is a\r\ngeneral name for the whole of Scandinavia. 6. That of Gosselin, who\r\nthinks that under this name Mainland, the principal of the Shetland\r\nIslands, is meant. It is by no means impossible that under the name of\r\nThule two or more of these localities may have been meant, by different\r\nauthors writing at distant periods and under different states of\r\ngeographical knowledge. It is also pretty generally acknowledged, as\r\nParisot remarks, that the Thule mentioned by Ptolemy is identical with\r\nThylemark in Norway.\r\n\r\n[2945] B. ii. c. 77.\r\n\r\n[2946] Brotier thinks that under this name a part of Cornwall is meant,\r\nand that it was erroneously supposed to be an island. Parisot is of\r\nopinion that the copyists, or more probably Pliny himself, has made an\r\nerror in transcribing Mictis for Vectis, the name of the Isle of Wight.\r\nIt is not improbable however that the island of Mictis had only an\r\nimaginary existence.\r\n\r\n[2947] “White lead”: not, however, the metallic substance which we\r\nunderstand by that name, but tin.\r\n\r\n[2948] Commonly known as “coracles,” and used by the Welch in modern\r\ntimes. See B. vii. c. 57 of this work, and the Note.\r\n\r\n[2949] Brotier, with many other writers, takes these names to refer to\r\nvarious parts of the coast of Norway. Scandia he considers to be the\r\nsame as Scania, Bergos the modern Bergen, and Nerigos the northern part\r\nof Norway. On the other hand, Gosselin is of opinion that under the\r\nname of Bergos the Scottish island of Barra is meant, and under that\r\nof Nerigos, the island of Lewis, the northern promontory of which is\r\nin the old maps designated by the name of Nary or Nery. Ptolemy makes\r\nmention of an island called Doumna in the vicinity of the Orcades.\r\n\r\n[2950] Transalpine Gaul, with the exception of that part of it called\r\nNarbonensis, was called Gallia Comata, from the custom of the people\r\nallowing their hair to grow to a great length.\r\n\r\n[2951] From the Scheldt to the Seine.\r\n\r\n[2952] From the Seine to the Garonne.\r\n\r\n[2953] Lyonese Gaul, from Lugdunum, the ancient name of the city of\r\nLyons.\r\n\r\n[2954] Said by Camden to be derived from the Celtic words _Ar - mor_,\r\n“by the Sea.”\r\n\r\n[2955] The provinces of Antwerp and North Brabant.\r\n\r\n[2956] Inhabiting Western Flanders.\r\n\r\n[2957] So called, it is supposed, from the Celtic word _Mor_, which\r\nmeans “the sea.” Térouane and Boulogne are supposed to occupy the site\r\nof their towns, situate in the modern Pas de Calais.\r\n\r\n[2958] D’Anville places them between Calais and Gravellines, in the Pas\r\nde Calais, and on the spot now known as the Terre de Marck or Merk.\r\n\r\n[2959] Boulogne, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2960] Cluver thinks that “Brianni” would be the correct reading here;\r\nbut D’Anville places the Britanni on the southern bank of the stream\r\ncalled La Canche in the Pas de Calais.\r\n\r\n[2961] According to Parisot and Ansart they occupied the department of\r\nthe Somme, with places on the site of Amiens (derived from their name)\r\nand Abbeville for their chief towns.\r\n\r\n[2962] They dwelt in the modern department of the Oise, with Beauvais\r\n(which still retains their name) for their chief town.\r\n\r\n[2963] D’Anville is of opinion that the place called Haiz or Hez in\r\nthe diocese of Beauvais, received its name from this people, of whom\r\nnothing else is known. The name is omitted in several of the editions.\r\n\r\n[2964] D’Anville is of opinion that their chief town was situate at the\r\nmodern Chaours, at the passage of the river Serre, not far from Vervins\r\nin the department of the Aisne.\r\n\r\n[2965] According to Ptolemy their chief town would be on the site of\r\nthe modern Orchies in the department du Nord, but Cæsar makes it to be\r\nNemetacum, the modern Arras, the capital of the department of the Pas\r\nde Calais.\r\n\r\n[2966] According to Ansart their chief town was Bavai, in the\r\ndepartment du Nord. They are called “Liberi,” or free, because they\r\nwere left at liberty to enjoy their own laws and institutions.\r\n\r\n[2967] Their capital was Augusta Veromanduorum, and it has been\r\nsuggested that the place called Vermand, in the department de l’Aisne,\r\ndenotes its site; but according to Bellay and D’Anville the city of St.\r\nQuentin, which was formerly called Aouste, marks the spot.\r\n\r\n[2968] Nothing whatever is known of them, and it is suggested by\r\nthe commentators that this is a corrupted form of the name of the\r\nSuessiones, which follows.\r\n\r\n[2969] They gave name to Soissons in the southern part of the\r\ndepartment de l’Aisne.\r\n\r\n[2970] It has been suggested that these are the same as the\r\nSilvanectes, the inhabitants of Senlis in the department de l’Oise.\r\n\r\n[2971] The people of Tongres, in the provinces of Namur, Liège, and\r\nLimbourg.\r\n\r\n[2972] They are supposed to have dwelt in the eastern part of the\r\nprovince of Limbourg.\r\n\r\n[2973] They probably dwelt between the Sunuci and the Betasi.\r\n\r\n[2974] They are supposed to have dwelt in the western part of the\r\nprovince of Limbourg, on the confines of that province and South\r\nBrabant, in the vicinity probably of the place which still bears the\r\nname of Beetz, upon the river Gette, between Leau and Haclen, seven\r\nmiles to the east of Louvain.\r\n\r\n[2975] According to Ptolemy the Leuci dwelt on the sites of Toul in the\r\ndepartment of the Meurthe, and of Nais or Nays in that of the Meuse.\r\n\r\n[2976] From them Trèves or Trier, in the Grand Duchy of the Lower\r\nRhine, takes its name.\r\n\r\n[2977] Their chief town was on the site of Langres, in the department\r\nof the Haute Marne.\r\n\r\n[2978] They gave name to the city of Rheims in the department of the\r\nMarne.\r\n\r\n[2979] Their chief town stood on the site of the modern Metz, in the\r\ndepartment of the Moselle.\r\n\r\n[2980] Besançon stands on the site of their chief town, in the\r\ndepartment of the Doubs, extending as far as Bâle.\r\n\r\n[2981] The inhabitants of the district called the Haut Rhin or Higher\r\nRhine.\r\n\r\n[2982] The inhabitants of the west of Switzerland.\r\n\r\n[2983] Or the “Equestrian Colony,” probably founded by the Roman\r\nEquites. It is not known where this colony was situate, but it is\r\nsuggested by Cluver and Monetus that it may have been on the lake of\r\nGeneva, in the vicinity of the modern town of Nyon.\r\n\r\n[2984] Littré, in a note, remarks that Rauriaca is a barbarism, and\r\nthat the reading properly is “Raurica.”\r\n\r\n[2985] Spire was their chief city, in the province of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n[2986] They are supposed to have occupied Strasbourg, and the greater\r\npart of the department of the Lower Rhine.\r\n\r\n[2987] They dwelt in the modern Grand Duchy of Hesse Darmstadt; Worms\r\nwas their chief city.\r\n\r\n[2988] That is, nearer the mouths of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n[2989] They originally dwelt on the right bank of the Rhine, but were\r\ntransported across the river by Agrippa in B.C. 37, at their own\r\nrequest, from a wish to escape the attacks of the Suevi.\r\n\r\n[2990] Now known as the city of Cologne. It took its name from\r\nAgrippina, the wife of Claudius and the mother of Nero, who was born\r\nthere, and who, as Tacitus says, to show off her power to the allied\r\nnations, planted a colony of veteran soldiers in her native city, and\r\ngave to it her own name.\r\n\r\n[2991] Their district was in the modern circle of Clèves, in the\r\nprovince of Juliers-Berg-Clèves.\r\n\r\n[2992] Dwelling in the Insula Batavorum, mentioned in C. 29 of the\r\npresent Book.\r\n\r\n[2993] He first speaks of the nations on the coast, and then of those\r\nmore in the interior.\r\n\r\n[2994] Dwelling in the west of the department of Calvados, and the east\r\nof the department of the Eure. From them Lisieux takes its name.\r\n\r\n[2995] They occupied the department of the Lower Seine.\r\n\r\n[2996] They are supposed to have dwelt in the vicinity of Lillebonne,\r\nin the department of the Lower Seine.\r\n\r\n[2997] They gave name to the town of Vannes in the department of\r\nMorbihan.\r\n\r\n[2998] From them the city of Avranches, in the department of La Manche,\r\nderives its name.\r\n\r\n[2999] They occupied the modern department of Finisterre.\r\n\r\n[3000] The Loire.\r\n\r\n[3001] This spot is placed by D’Anville near the modern city of Saint\r\nBrieuc. He refers here to the peninsula of Brittany, which ends in\r\nFinisterre.\r\n\r\n[3002] Ansart remarks that the circuit of the peninsula from Saint\r\nBrieuc to the mouth of the river Vilaine is only 450 miles, but that if\r\ntaken from the city of Avranches to the mouth of the Loire, it is 650.\r\n\r\n[3003] Ansart states that from Avranches to the mouth of the Loire, in\r\na straight line, is twenty miles less than the distance here given by\r\nPliny.\r\n\r\n[3004] Inhabitants of the department of the Lower Loire or Loire\r\nInférieure.\r\n\r\n[3005] This extensive people inhabited the present departments of the\r\nSaone et Loire, Allier, Nievre, Rhone nord, and Loire nord. Autun and\r\nChalons-sur-Marne stand on the site of their ancient towns.\r\n\r\n[3006] They inhabited the departments of the Eure et Loire, and\r\nportions of those of the Seine et Oise, of the Loire et Cher, and of the\r\nLoiret. Chartres occupies the site of their town.\r\n\r\n[3007] They occupied a part of the department of the Allier. Moulins\r\nstands on the site of their chief town.\r\n\r\n[3008] Sens, in the department of the Yonne, stands on the site of\r\ntheir chief town.\r\n\r\n[3009] The chief town of the Aulerci Eburovices was on the site of the\r\npresent Passy-sur-Eure, called by the inhabitants Old Evreux, in the\r\ndepartment of the Eure.\r\n\r\n[3010] They dwelt in the vicinity of the city of Le Mans, in the\r\ndepartment of the Sarthe.\r\n\r\n[3011] Meaux, in the department of the Seine et Marne, denotes the site\r\nof their principal town.\r\n\r\n[3012] Paris, anciently Lutetia, denotes their locality.\r\n\r\n[3013] The city of Troyes, in the department of the Aube, denotes their\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\n[3014] Their chief town stood on the site of Angers, in the department\r\nof the Maine et Loire.\r\n\r\n[3015] D’Anville says that their chief town stood on the spot now known\r\nas Vieux, two leagues from Caen, in the department of Calvados.\r\n\r\n[3016] The reading here is not improbably “Vadicasses.” If so, they\r\nwere a people situate at a great distance from the other tribes here\r\nmentioned by Pliny. They dwelt in the department De l’Oise, in the\r\ndistrict formerly known as Valois, their chief town or city occupying\r\nthe site of Vez, not far from Villers Cotterets.\r\n\r\n[3017] D’Anville assigns to the Venelli, or Unelli, as some readings\r\nhave it, the former district of Cotantin, now called the department of\r\nLa Manche.\r\n\r\n[3018] According to D’Anville, Corseuil, two leagues from Dinan, in the\r\ndepartment of the Côtes du Nord, denotes the site of their chief town.\r\nHardouin takes Quimper to mark the locality.\r\n\r\n[3019] They are supposed by Ansart to have occupied that part of the\r\ndepartment of La Mayenne where we find the village of Jublains, two\r\nleagues from the city of Mayenne.\r\n\r\n[3020] D’Anville assigns to them the greater part of the department of\r\nthe Ile et Vilaine, and is of opinion that the city of Rennes occupies\r\nthe site of Condate, their chief town.\r\n\r\n[3021] Tours, in the department of the Indre et Loire, marks the site\r\nof their chief town.\r\n\r\n[3022] They are supposed to have occupied a portion of the department\r\nof the Loire.\r\n\r\n[3023] They probably occupied a part of the department of the Loire, as\r\nalso of that of the Rhone. Their town, Forum Secusianorum, stood on the\r\nsite of the present Feurs, in the department of the Loire.\r\n\r\n[3024] The city of Lyons occupies the site of ancient Lugdunum. It\r\nis suggested by Hardouin, that the name Lugdunum is a corruption of\r\n“Lucudunum,” a compound of the Latin word _lucus_, “a grove,” and the\r\nCeltic _dun_, “a hill” or “mountain.”\r\n\r\n[3025] They are mentioned by Cæsar (B. C. iii. 9), in conjunction with\r\nthe Nannetes, Morini, and others, but nothing can be inferred as to the\r\nprecise position they occupied.\r\n\r\n[3026] Their locality also is unknown, but it is supposed that they\r\ndwelt in the vicinity of the department of La Vendée.\r\n\r\n[3027] From them ancient Poitou received its name. They are supposed to\r\nhave occupied the department of the Haute-Vienne, and portions of the\r\ndepartments of La Vendée, the Loire Inférieure, the Maine et Loire, the\r\nDeux-Sèvres, and La Vienne.\r\n\r\n[3028] They gave name to the former Saintonge, now the department of\r\nCharente and Charente Inférieure. The town of Saintes occupies the site\r\nof their chief town.\r\n\r\n[3029] They occupied the modern department of the Gironde. The city of\r\nBordeaux occupies the site of their chief town.\r\n\r\n[3030] They gave name to Aquitaine, which became corrupted into\r\nGuyenne. Pliny is the only author that makes the Aquitani a distinct\r\npeople of the province of Aquitanica. The Tarusates are supposed to\r\nhave afterwards occupied the site here referred to by him, with Atures\r\nfor their chief town, afterwards called Aire, in the department of the\r\nLandes.\r\n\r\n[3031] Their locality is unknown, but it has been suggested that they\r\noccupied the departments of the Basses Pyrénées, or Lower Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n[3032] So called from the Latin verb _convenire_, “to assemble” or\r\n“meet together.” They are said to have received this name from the\r\ncircumstance that Ptolemy, after the close of the Sertorian war,\r\nfinding a pastoral people of predatory habits inhabiting the range\r\nof the Pyrenees, ordered them to unite together and form a community\r\nin a town or city. From them the present town of Saint Bertrand de\r\nComminges, in the S.W. of the department of the Haute Garonne, derives\r\nits Latin name “Lugdunum Convenarum.”\r\n\r\n[3033] By Cæsar called the Bigerriones. Their name was preserved\r\nin that of the district of Bigorre, now the department of the\r\nHautes-Pyrénées. Their chief town was Turba, now Tarbes.\r\n\r\n[3034] By calling the Tarbelli _Quatuorsignani_, he seems to imply that\r\ntheir chief town was a place garrisoned by four maniples of soldiers,\r\neach with a _signum_ or standard. Aquæ Tarbellicæ was their chief town,\r\nthe modern Acqs or Dax, in the S.W. of the department of the Landes.\r\n\r\n[3035] Their chief town was probably garrisoned by six _signa_ or\r\nmaniples. Cocosa, or Coequosa, as it is written in the Antonine\r\nItinerary, is the first place on a road from Aquæ Tarbellicæ or Dax to\r\nBurdegala or Bordeaux, now called Marensin. Their locality was in the\r\nsouthern part of the department of the Landes, the inhabitants of which\r\nare still divided into two classes, the Bouges, those of the north, or\r\nof the Tête de Buch; and the Cousiots, those of the south.\r\n\r\n[3036] Their locality is unknown.\r\n\r\n[3037] D’Anville would read “Onobusates,” and thinks that they dwelt in\r\nthe district called Nébousan, in the department of the Hautes Pyrénées.\r\nHe is also of opinion that their town stood on the site of the modern\r\nCioutat, between the rivers Adour and Neste.\r\n\r\n[3038] They occupied the southern part of the department of the Gironde.\r\n\r\n[3039] From them Hardouin suggests that Moneins, in the department of\r\nthe Basses Pyrénées, takes its name.\r\n\r\n[3040] D’Anville is of opinion that they inhabited and gave name to\r\nthe Vallée d’Ossun, between the Pyrenees and the city of Oléron in the\r\ndepartment of the Basses Pyrénées.\r\n\r\n[3041] D’Anville places them in the Vallée de Soule, in the department\r\nof the Basses Pyrénées.\r\n\r\n[3042] From them Campon, a place in the department of the Hautes\r\nPyrénées, is supposed to have received its name.\r\n\r\n[3043] Biscarosse, not far from Tête de Buch in the department of the\r\nLandes, is supposed to derive its name from this tribe.\r\n\r\n[3044] Nothing whatever is known of them.\r\n\r\n[3045] The more general reading is “Sassumini.” Ansart suggests that\r\nthe town of Sarrum, between Cognac and Périgueux, in the department of\r\nthe Dordogne, may have received its name from them.\r\n\r\n[3046] Ansart suggests that Rieumes, in the department of the Haute\r\nGaronne, occupies the site of Ryesium, their chief town, mentioned by\r\nPtolemy.\r\n\r\n[3047] They are supposed to have given name to Tournay, in the\r\ndepartment of the Hautes Pyrénées.\r\n\r\n[3048] Supposed to be the same as the Consuarini, mentioned in B. iii.\r\nc. 5.\r\n\r\n[3049] They probably gave name to Auch, in the department of Gers.\r\n\r\n[3050] Their chief town occupied the site of Euse or Eause, in the\r\ndepartment of Gers.\r\n\r\n[3051] Their locality is marked by Soz, in the department of the\r\nLot-et-Garonne.\r\n\r\n[3052] Or “Oscidates of the Plains.” They probably gave name to Ossun,\r\ntwo miles from Tarbes, in the department of the Hautes Pyrénées.\r\n\r\n[3053] From them the village of Cestas, three leagues from Bordeaux, in\r\nthe department of the Gironde, is supposed to derive its name.\r\n\r\n[3054] The village of Tursan, in the department of the Landes, probably\r\nderived its name from this tribe.\r\n\r\n[3055] Their town was Cossio, afterwards Vasates, now Bazas, in the\r\ndepartment of the Gironde.\r\n\r\n[3056] The site of the Vassei and the Sennates appears to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[3057] D’Anville is of opinion that this tribe gave name to Aisenay\r\nor Azenay, a village four leagues distant from Bourbon-Vendée, in the\r\ndepartment of La Vendée.\r\n\r\n[3058] They occupied the district formerly known as Berry, but now the\r\ndepartments of the Indre, the Cher, and the west of the department of\r\nthe Allier. Their chief town was Avaricum, now Bourges.\r\n\r\n[3059] They inhabited the district formerly known as the Limosin, now\r\nthe departments of the Creuse, the Haute Vienne, and the Corrèze. Their\r\nchief town was Augustoritum, afterwards Lemovices, now Limoges.\r\n\r\n[3060] They occupied the district formerly known as Auvergne, forming\r\nthe present department of the Allier, and the southern part of the\r\nPuy de Dôme and the Cantal. Augustonemetum was their chief town, now\r\nClermont.\r\n\r\n[3061] Situate in the district formerly known as Gevaudan, now the\r\ndepartment of La Lozère. Their chief town stood on the site of the\r\npresent small town of Javoulx, four leagues from Mende.\r\n\r\n[3062] They are supposed to have occupied the former district of\r\nRouergue, now known as the department of Aveyron. Their chief town was\r\nSegodunum, afterwards Ruteni, now known as Rhodez.\r\n\r\n[3063] They occupied the former district of Querci, the present\r\ndepartment of Lot and Lot-et-Garonne. Divona, afterwards Cadurci, now\r\nCahors, was their principal town.\r\n\r\n[3064] According to Ptolemy their town was Aginnum, probably the modern\r\nAgen, in the present department of Lot-et-Garonne. “Antobroges,”\r\nhowever, is the more common reading.\r\n\r\n[3065] They occupied the district formerly known as Périgord, in\r\nthe department of the Dordogne; their town was Vesanna, afterwards\r\nPetrocori, now Périgueux.\r\n\r\n[3066] Ansart says they are about 200 in number, consisting of Belle\r\nIsle, Groaix, Houat, Hoedic, and others. Also probably Morbihan.\r\n\r\n[3067] The Isle of Oleron, the fountain-head of the maritime laws of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[3068] He means to say that it gradually increases in breadth after\r\nleaving the narrow neck of the Pyrenees and approaching the confines of\r\nLusitania.\r\n\r\n[3069] B. iii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[3070] From Ruscino to Gades.\r\n\r\n[3071] In the province now known as Guipuzcoa.\r\n\r\n[3072] Supposed to be the present Cabo de la Higuera.\r\n\r\n[3073] Probably inhabiting the eastern part of the provinces of Biscay\r\nand Alava, the eastern portion of Navarre, and, perhaps, a part of the\r\nprovince of Guipuzcoa.\r\n\r\n[3074] According to Hardouin the modern San Sebastian occupies the site\r\nof their town.\r\n\r\n[3075] On the same site as the modern Bermeo, according to Mannert.\r\nHardouin thinks, however, and with greater probability, that it was\r\nsituate at the mouth of the river Orio.\r\n\r\n[3076] D’Anville considers this to be the site of the city of Bermeo.\r\n\r\n[3077] Poinsinet thinks that this is Flavio in Bilbao, D’Anville calls\r\nit Portugalette, and Mannert thinks that it is the same as Santander,\r\nwith which opinion Ansart agrees.\r\n\r\n[3078] According to Ptolemy, the Cantabri possessed the western part of\r\nthe province of La Montana, and the northern parts of the provinces of\r\nPalencia and Toro.\r\n\r\n[3079] Most probably the present Rio de Suancès, by Mannert called\r\nthe Saya, into which the Besanga flows. Hardouin however calls it the\r\nNervio.\r\n\r\n[3080] Ansart suggests that this is the modern San Vicente de la\r\nBarquera. If the river Sauga is the same with the Suancès, this cannot\r\nbe the port of Santander, as has been suggested.\r\n\r\n[3081] Or Ebro.\r\n\r\n[3082] According to Ansart, this is either the modern Ensenada de\r\nBallota or else the Puerta de Pô.\r\n\r\n[3083] According to Ansart, the Orgenomesci occupied the same territory\r\nwhich Ptolemy has assigned to the Cantabri in general. See Note [3078]\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[3084] Hardouin takes this to be Villaviciosa. Ansart thinks that Ria\r\nde Cella occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[3085] They are supposed to have occupied the greater part of the\r\nprincipality of the Asturias and the province of Leon.\r\n\r\n[3086] Hardouin and Mannert consider this to be identical with Navia\r\nor Nava, six miles to the east of Oviedo, an obscure place in the\r\ninterior. Ansart however would identify it with Villaviciosa.\r\n\r\n[3087] No doubt the headland now known as the Cabo de Penas.\r\n\r\n[3088] Now Lugo in Gallicia.\r\n\r\n[3089] Supposed by Ansart to be the Rio Caneiro, into which the Rio\r\nLabio discharges itself.\r\n\r\n[3090] Supposed by Ansart to have dwelt in the vicinity of the Celtic\r\npromontory, now Cabo de Finisterra or Cape Finisterre. Of the Egovarri\r\nand Iadoni nothing whatever is known.\r\n\r\n[3091] Their towns are mentioned by Ptolemy as being situate on a bay\r\nnear Nerium or the promontory of Cape Finisterre.\r\n\r\n[3092] Mannert thinks that the Nelo is the same as the Rio Allones; the\r\nFlorius seems not to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[3093] The inhabitants of Cape Finisterre.\r\n\r\n[3094] Dwelling on the banks of the river which from them takes its\r\nmodern name of Tambre.\r\n\r\n[3095] Mannert and Ansart are of opinion that this peninsula was\r\nprobably the modern Cabo Taurinan or Cabo Villano, most probably the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n[3096] On the occasion probably of his expedition against the Cantabri.\r\n\r\n[3097] Their towns, Iria Flavia and Lacus Augusti, lay in the interior,\r\non the sites of the present Santiago de Compostella and Lugo.\r\n\r\n[3098] Probably the modern Noya.\r\n\r\n[3099] They are supposed to have occupied the district in which the\r\nwarm springs are found, which are known as Caldas de Contis and Caldas\r\nde Rey.\r\n\r\n[3100] It is suggested by Ansart that the islands here meant are those\r\ncalled Carreira, at the mouth of the river Ulla, and the Islas de Ons,\r\nat the mouth of the Tenario.\r\n\r\n[3101] See B. iii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[3102] Inhabiting the vicinity of the modern Pontevedra.\r\n\r\n[3103] According to Ptolemy also their town was Tudæ, the modern Tuy.\r\n\r\n[3104] The modern Islas de Seyas or of Bayona.\r\n\r\n[3105] The town of Bayona, about six leagues from the mouth of the\r\nriver Minho.\r\n\r\n[3106] The Minho.\r\n\r\n[3107] They occupied the tract of country lying between the rivers, and\r\nknown as Entre Douro y Minho.\r\n\r\n[3108] Now Braga on the Cavado.\r\n\r\n[3109] The Lima.\r\n\r\n[3110] The river Douro.\r\n\r\n[3111] See B. iii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[3112] Both lead, properly so called, and tin.\r\n\r\n[3113] In a great degree corresponding with modern Portugal, except\r\nthat the latter includes the tract of country between the Minho and\r\nDouro.\r\n\r\n[3114] To distinguish them from the nation of the same name sprung\r\nfrom them, and occupying the Farther Spain. (B. iii. c. 3.) The Pæsuri\r\noccupied the site of the present towns of Lamego and Arouca.\r\n\r\n[3115] The modern Vouga, which runs below the town of Aveiro, raised\r\nfrom the ruins of ancient Talabrica.\r\n\r\n[3116] Agueda, which, according to Hardouin, is the name of both the\r\nriver and the town.\r\n\r\n[3117] Coimbra, formerly Condeja la Veja.\r\n\r\n[3118] Leiria is supposed to occupy its site.\r\n\r\n[3119] According to Hardouin, the modern Ebora de Alcobaza, ten leagues\r\nfrom Leiria.\r\n\r\n[3120] The modern Cabo de la Roca, seven leagues from Lisbon.\r\n\r\n[3121] Pliny, in C. 34, places the Arrotrebæ, belonging to the\r\nConventus of Lucus Augusti, about the Promontorium Celticum, which,\r\nif not the same as the Nerium (or Cape Finisterre) of the others, is\r\nevidently in its immediate neighbourhood; but he confuses the whole\r\nmatter by a very curious error. He mentions a promontory called\r\nArtabrum as the headland _at the N.W. extremity of Spain_; the coast\r\non the one side of it looking to the north and the Gallic Ocean, on\r\nthe other to the west and the Atlantic Ocean. But he considers this\r\npromontory to be the west _headland of the estuary of the Tagus_,\r\nand adds, that some called it _Magnum Promontorium_, or the “Great\r\nPromontory,” and others Olisiponense, from the city of Olisipo, or\r\nLisbon. He assigns, in fact, all the west coast of Spain, down to the\r\nmouth of the Tagus, to the north coast, and, instead of being led\r\nto detect his error by the resemblance of name between his Artabrum\r\nPromontorium and his Arrotrebæ (the Artabri of his predecessors, Strabo\r\nand Mela), he perversely finds fault with those who had placed above\r\nthe promontory Artabrum, a people of the same name who never were there.\r\n\r\n[3122] On the site of which the present city of Lisbon stands.\r\n\r\n[3123] See note [3121] in the preceding page.\r\n\r\n[3124] See note [3121].\r\n\r\n[3125] See note [3116] in the preceding page.\r\n\r\n[3126] Among these is Pomponius Mela, who confounds the river Limia,\r\nmentioned in the last chapter, with the Æminius, or Agueda.\r\n\r\n[3127] Now the river Mondego.\r\n\r\n[3128] See B. xxxiii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[3129] Now Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[3130] Pliny continues his error here, in taking part of the western\r\nside of Spain for the north, and part of the southern coast for the\r\nwestern.\r\n\r\n[3131] B. iii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[3132] With the Vettones, situate in the province of the Alentejo. See\r\nB. iii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[3133] In the present province of Algarve.\r\n\r\n[3134] Now Lisbon. Both Strabo, Solinus, and Martianus Capella make\r\nmention of a story that Ulysses came to Spain and founded this city.\r\n\r\n[3135] See B. viii. c. 67 of the present work.\r\n\r\n[3136] According to Hardouin, followed by D’Anville and Uckert, this\r\nplace gives name to Alcazar do Sal, nearly midway between Evora and the\r\nsea-shore. Mannert says Setuval, which D’Anville however supposes to be\r\nthe ancient Cetobriga.\r\n\r\n[3137] On its site stands Santiago de Cacem, nearly midway between\r\nLisbon and Cape St. Vincent.\r\n\r\n[3138] Or the “Wedge,” generally supposed to be Cabo de Santa Maria.\r\nAnsart however thinks that it is the Punta de Sagres, near Cape St.\r\nVincent. Pliny’s words indeed seem to imply a closer proximity than\r\nthat of Capes St. Vincent and Santa Maria.\r\n\r\n[3139] According to Hardouin, the modern Estombar; according to\r\nD’Anville, in the vicinity of Faro; but ten leagues from that place,\r\naccording to Mannert.\r\n\r\n[3140] Hardouin and D’Anville are of opinion that Tavira occupies its\r\nsite.\r\n\r\n[3141] Now Mertola, on the river Guadiana.\r\n\r\n[3142] Now Merida, on the Guadiana. A colony of veterans (Emeriti) was\r\nplanted there by Augustus.\r\n\r\n[3143] Now Medellin, in the province of Estremadura.\r\n\r\n[3144] Pax Julia, or Pax Augusta, in the country of the Turduli, or\r\nTurdetani; now Beja, in the province of the Alentejo.\r\n\r\n[3145] Now Alcantara, in the province of Estremadura.\r\n\r\n[3146] Now Truxillo, so called from Turris Julia.\r\n\r\n[3147] Now Caceres.\r\n\r\n[3148] Now called Santarem, from Saint Irene, the Virgin.\r\n\r\n[3149] “The Garrison of Julius.”\r\n\r\n[3150] “The Success of Julius.”\r\n\r\n[3151] Evora, between the Guadiana and the Tagus.\r\n\r\n[3152] “The Liberality of Julius.”\r\n\r\n[3153] B. iii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[3154] Hardouin takes Augustobriga to have stood on the site of Villar\r\ndel Pedroso on the Tagus. Other writers think that it is represented by\r\nthe present Ponte del Arcobispo.\r\n\r\n[3155] From Ammia, now Portalegre, on the frontier of Portugal. The\r\nsites of Arabrica and Balsa do not appear to have been ascertained.\r\n\r\n[3156] Capera stood on the site now called Las Ventas de Capara,\r\nbetween Alcantara and Coria. The site of Cæsarobrica has not been\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n[3157] Coria, in Estremadura, probably occupies the site of Caura.\r\n\r\n[3158] Hardouin suggests that the modern Tomar occupies the site of\r\nConcordia.\r\n\r\n[3159] Mannert is of opinion that the city of Lancia was situate in\r\nthe north of Lusitania, on the river Durius, or Douro, near the modern\r\nZamora.\r\n\r\n[3160] To distinguish them from the Mirobrigenses, surnamed Turduli,\r\nmentioned in B. iii. c. 3. Some writers think that this Mirobriga is\r\nthe present Ciudad Rodrigo; but Ambrose Morales takes it to be the\r\nplace called Malabriga, in the vicinity of that city.\r\n\r\n[3161] The name of Medubriga was afterwards Aramenha, of which Hardouin\r\nsays the ruins only were to be seen. They were probably called\r\n_Plumbarii_, from lead mines in their vicinity.\r\n\r\n[3162] According to Hardouin, Ocelum was in the vicinity of the modern\r\nCapara.\r\n\r\n[3163] From Cape de Creuz to the Promontory between the cities of\r\nFontarabia and Saint Sebastian.\r\n\r\n[3164] From the Greek κασσίτερος, “tin.” It is generally supposed that\r\nthe “Tin Islands” were the Scilly Isles, in the vicinity of Cornwall.\r\nAt the same time the Greek and Roman geographers, borrowing their\r\nknowledge from the accounts probably of the Phœnician merchants, seem\r\nto have had a very indistinct notion of their precise locality, and to\r\nhave thought them to be nearer to Spain than to Britain. Thus we find\r\nStrabo, in B. iii., saying, that “the Cassiterides are ten in number,\r\nlying near each other in the ocean, towards the north _from the haven\r\nof the Artabri_.” From a comparison of the accounts, it would almost\r\nappear that the ancient geographers confused the Scilly Islands with\r\nthe Azores, as those, who enter into any detail, attribute to the\r\nCassiterides the characteristics almost as much of the Azores and the\r\nsea in their vicinity, as of the Scilly Islands.\r\n\r\n[3165] Cape Finisterre.\r\n\r\n[3166] Or the “Islands of the Blest.” We cannot do better than quote a\r\nportion of the article on this subject in Dr. Smith’s “Dictionary of\r\nAncient Geography.” “‘Fortunatæ Insulæ’ is one of those geographical\r\nnames whose origin is lost in mythic darkness, but which afterwards\r\ncame to have a specific application, so closely resembling the old\r\nmythical notion, as to make it almost impossible to doubt that that\r\nnotion was based, in part at least, on some vague knowledge of the\r\nregions afterwards discovered. The earliest Greek poetry places the\r\nabode of the happy departed spirits far beyond the entrance of the\r\nMediterranean, at the extremity of the earth, and upon the shores of\r\nthe river Oceanus, or in islands in its midst; and Homer’s poetical\r\ndescription of the place may be applied almost word for word to those\r\nislands in the Atlantic, off the west coast of Africa, to which the\r\nname was given in the historical period. (Od. iv. l. 563, _seq._)\r\n‘There the life of mortals is most easy; there is no snow, nor winter,\r\nnor much rain, but Ocean is ever sending up the shrill breathing\r\nbreezes of Zephyrus to refresh men.’ Their delicious climate, and their\r\nsupposed identity of situation, marked out the Canary Islands, the\r\nMadeira group, and the Azores, as worthy to represent the Islands of\r\nthe Blest. In the more specific sense, however, the name was applied\r\nto the two former groups; while, in its widest application, it may\r\nhave even included the Cape de Verde Islands, its extension being in\r\nfact adapted to that of maritime discovery.” Pliny gives a further\r\ndescription of them in B. vi. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[3167] The strait between the island and the mainland is now called the\r\nRiver of Saint Peter. The circuit of the island, as stated by Pliny,\r\nvaries in the MSS. from fifteen to twenty-five miles, and this last is\r\nprobably correct.\r\n\r\n[3168] Julius Cæsar, on his visit to the city of Gades, during the\r\nCivil War in Spain, B.C. 49, conferred the citizenship of Rome on all\r\nthe citizens of Gades. Under Augustus it became a _municipium_, with\r\nthe title of ‘Augusta urbs Julia Gaditana.’ The modern city of Cadiz is\r\nbuilt upon its site.\r\n\r\n[3169] Or the Island of Venus.\r\n\r\n[3170] From the Greek word κότινος, “an olive-tree.”\r\n\r\n[3171] If Gades was not the same as Tartessus (probably the Tarshish of\r\nScripture), its exact locality is a question in dispute. Most ancient\r\nwriters place it at the mouth of the river Bætis, while others identify\r\nit, and perhaps with more probability, with the city of Carteia, on\r\nMount Calpe, the Rock of Gibraltar. The whole country west of Gibraltar\r\nwas called Tartessis. See B. iii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[3172] Or more properly ‘Agadir,’ or ‘Hagadir.’ It probably received\r\nthis name, meaning a ‘hedge,’ or ‘bulwark,’ from the fact of its being\r\nthe chief Phœnician colony outside of the Pillars of Hercules.\r\n\r\n[3173] Of Erythræa, or Erytheia. The monster Geryon, or Geryones,\r\nfabled to have had three bodies, lived in the fabulous Island of\r\nErytheia, or the “Red Isle,” so called because it lay under the rays of\r\nthe setting sun in the west. It was originally said to be situate off\r\nthe coast of Epirus, but was afterwards identified either with Gades\r\nor the Balearic islands, and was at all times believed to be in the\r\ndistant west. Geryon was said to have been the son of Chrysaor, the\r\nwealthy king of Iberia.\r\n\r\n[3174] Alluding to B. iii. c. 6. From Rhegium to the Alps. But _there_\r\nthe reading is 1020.\r\n\r\n[3175] Meaning Gessoriacum, the present Boulogne. He probably calls it\r\n_Britannicum_, from the circumstance that the Romans usually embarked\r\nthere for the purpose of crossing over to Britain.\r\n\r\n[3176] The present Santen in the Duchy of Cleves.\r\n\r\n[3177] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[3178] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[3179] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[3180] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[3181] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[3182] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[3183] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[3184] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[3185] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[3186] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[3187] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[3188] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[3189] Ateius, surnamed _Prætextatus_, and also Philologus, which\r\nlast name he assumed to indicate his learning, was born at Athens,\r\nand was one of the most celebrated grammarians of Rome, in the latter\r\npart of the first century B.C. He was originally a freedman of the\r\njurist Ateius Capito, by whom he was described as “a rhetorician among\r\ngrammarians, and a grammarian among rhetoricians.” He was on terms of\r\nintimacy with Sallust the historian, and Asinius Pollio. It is supposed\r\nthat he assisted Sallust in the compilation of his history; but to what\r\nextent is not known. But few of his numerous commentaries were extant\r\neven in the time of Suetonius.\r\n\r\n[3190] A native of Megalopolis in Arcadia, born about B.C. 204. He was\r\ntrained probably in political knowledge and the military art under\r\nPhilopœmen, and was sent, as a prisoner to Rome, with others, to answer\r\nthe charge of not aiding the Romans in their war against Perseus. Here,\r\nby great good fortune, he secured the friendship of Scipio Africanus,\r\nwith whom he was present at the destruction of Carthage. His history is\r\none of the most valuable works that has come down to us from antiquity.\r\n\r\n[3191] Of Miletus, one of the earliest and most distinguished Greek\r\nhistorians and geographers. He lived about the 65th Olympiad, or\r\nB.C. 520. A few fragments, quoted, are all that are left of his\r\nhistorical and geographical works. There is little doubt that Herodotus\r\nextensively availed himself of this writer’s works, though it is\r\nequally untrue that he has transcribed whole passages from him, as\r\nPorphyrius has ventured to assert.\r\n\r\n[3192] Of Mitylene, supposed to have flourished about B.C. 450. He\r\nappears to have written numerous geographical and historical works,\r\nwhich, with the exception of a considerable number of fragments, are\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n[3193] Of Sigæum, a Greek historian, contemporary with Herodotus. He\r\nwrote a history of Greece, and several other works, all of which, with\r\na few unimportant exceptions, are lost.\r\n\r\n[3194] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[3195] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[3196] A Rhodian by birth. He was admiral of the fleet of Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus, who reigned from B.C. 285 to 247. He wrote a work “On\r\nHarbours,” in ten books, which was copied by Eratosthenes, and is\r\nfrequently quoted by ancient writers. Strabo also says that he composed\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n[3197] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[3198] Of Cumæ, or Cymæ, in Ionia. He flourished about B.C. 408. He\r\nstudied under Isocrates, and gained considerable fame as a historian.\r\nThough anxious to disclose the truth, he has been accused of sometimes\r\nforcing his authorities to suit his own views. Of his history of\r\nGreece, and his essays on various subjects, a few fragments only\r\nsurvive.\r\n\r\n[3199] A grammarian of Mallus, in Cilicia. He lived in the time of\r\nPtolemy Philopater, and resided at Pergamus, under the patronage of\r\nEumenes II. and Attalus II. In his grammatical system he made a strong\r\ndistinction between _criticism_ and _grammar_, the latter of which\r\nsciences he regarded as quite subordinate to the former. Of his learned\r\ncommentaries on the Iliad and the Odyssey, only a few fragments have\r\ncome down to us.\r\n\r\n[3200] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[3201] Of Cyrene, an Alexandrian grammarian and poet. He flourished at\r\nAlexandria, whither Ptolemy Philadelphus had invited him to a place\r\nin the Museum. Of his Hymns and Epigrams many are still extant. His\r\nElegies, which were of considerable poetical merit, with the exception\r\nof a few fragments, have all perished. Of his numerous other works in\r\nprose, not one is extant in an entire state.\r\n\r\n[3202] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[3203] Probably Apollodorus of Artemita, in Mesopotamia. It is probably\r\nto him that a Treatise on Islands and Cities has been ascribed by\r\nTzetzes, as also a History of the Parthians, and a History of Pontus.\r\n\r\n[3204] Probably the author of that name, who wrote the History of\r\nCyzicus, is the person here referred to. He is called by Athenæus both\r\na Babylonian and a Cyzican. His work is entirely lost; but it appears\r\nto have been extensively read, and is referred to by Cicero and other\r\nancient writers.\r\n\r\n[3205] Of Neapolis. He wrote a History of Hannibal, and to him has\r\nbeen ascribed a Description of the Universe, of which a fragment still\r\nsurvives.\r\n\r\n[3206] Of Tauromenium, in Sicily; a celebrated historian, who\r\nflourished about the year B.C. 300. He was banished from Sicily by\r\nAgathocles, and passed his exile at Athens. He composed a History of\r\nSicily, from the earliest times to the year B.C. 264. The value of his\r\nhistory has been gravely attacked by Polybius; but there is little\r\ndoubt that it possessed very considerable merit. Of this, and other\r\nworks of Timæus, only a few fragments survive.\r\n\r\n[3207] A Greek historian; a native of Lesbos. When he lived is unknown.\r\nDionysius, of Halicarnassus, has borrowed from him a portion of his\r\naccount of the Pelasgians. He is said to have been the author of the\r\nnotion that the Tyrrhenians, in consequence of their wanderings after\r\nthey left their original settlement, got the name of πελαργοὶ, or\r\n“storks.” He is supposed to have written a History of Lesbos, as also a\r\nwork called “Historical Paradoxes.”\r\n\r\n[3208] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[3209] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[3210] Of this author nothing whatever seems to be known.\r\n\r\n[3211] Of Miletus, born B.C. 610. One of the earliest philosophers of\r\nthe Ionian school, and said to be a pupil of Thales. Unless Pherecydes\r\nof Scyros be an exception, he was the first author of a philosophical\r\ntreatise in Greek prose. Other writings are ascribed to him by Suidas;\r\nbut, no doubt, on insufficient grounds. Of his treatise, which seems to\r\nhave contained summary statements of his opinions, no remains exist.\r\n\r\n[3212] Of this writer nothing whatever is known, beyond the fact that,\r\nfrom his name, he seems to have been a native of Mallus, in Cilicia.\r\n\r\n[3213] It seems impossible to say which, out of the vast number of\r\nthe authors who bore this name, is the one here referred to. It is\r\nnot improbable that Dionysius of Chalcis, a Greek historian who lived\r\nbefore the Christian era, is meant. He wrote a work on the Foundation\r\nof Towns, in five books, which is frequently referred to by the\r\nancients. It is not probable that the author of the Periegesis, or\r\n“Description of the World,” is referred to, as that book bears internal\r\nmarks of having been compiled in the third or fourth century of the\r\nChristian era.\r\n\r\n[3214] Of Miletus. He was the author of the “Milesiaca,” a romance of\r\nlicentious character, which was translated into Latin by L. Cornelius\r\nSisenna. He is looked upon as the inventor of the Greek romance, and\r\nthe title of his work is supposed to have given rise to the term\r\n_Milesian_, as applied to works of fiction.\r\n\r\n[3215] A Greek author, of whom nothing is known, except that Pliny, and\r\nafter him Solinus, refer to him as the authority for the statement that\r\nEubœa was originally called Chalcis, from the fact of (χαλκὸς) copper\r\nbeing first discovered there.\r\n\r\n[3216] Probably Menæchmus of Sicyon, who wrote a book on Actors, a\r\nHistory of Alexander the Great, and a book on Sicyon. Suidas says that\r\nhe flourished in the time of the successors of Alexander.\r\n\r\n[3217] When he flourished is unknown. He is said by Hyginus to have\r\nwritten a History of the Island of Naxos.\r\n\r\n[3218] He lived after the time of Alexander the Great; but his age is\r\nunknown. He wrote a book, περὶ νόστων, on the returns of the Greeks\r\nfrom their various expeditions, an account of Delos, a History of\r\nAlexander the Great, and other works, all of which have perished.\r\n\r\n[3219] Of Heraclæa, in Pontus. He was a pupil of Plato, and, after him,\r\nof Aristotle. His works upon philosophy, history, mathematics, and\r\nother subjects, were very numerous; but, unfortunately, they are nearly\r\nall of them lost. He wrote a Treatise upon Islands, and another upon\r\nthe Origin of Cities.\r\n\r\n[3220] A geographical writer, of whom nothing further is known.\r\n\r\n[3221] The Greek historian, the disciple of Socrates, deservedly\r\nstyled the “Attic Bee.” His principal works are the Anabasis, or the\r\nHistory of the Expedition of the younger Cyrus and the Retreat of the\r\nTen Thousand; the Hellenica, or History of Greece, from the time when\r\nthat of Thucydides ends to the battle of Mantinea, B.C. 362; and the\r\nCyropædia, or Education of Cyrus. The greater portion of his works is\r\nnow lost.\r\n\r\n[3222] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[3223] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[3224] There were two physicians of this name, one of Catana, in\r\nSicily, the other of Dyrrhachium, in Illyricum, who, like his namesake,\r\nwas the author of numerous works. It is doubtful, however, whether\r\nPliny here refers to either of those authors.\r\n\r\n[3225] A Greek historian, quoted by Dionysius of Halicarnassus. If\r\nthe same person as the father of the historian Nymphis, he must have\r\nlived in the early part of the second century B.C. He wrote a work on\r\nIslands, and another entitled Χρόνοι, or Chronicles.\r\n\r\n[3226] A Greek geographer, who seems to have written an account of\r\nCyprus.\r\n\r\n[3227] He is quoted by Strabo, Athenæus, and the Scholiasts; but all\r\nthat is known of him is, that he wrote a work on Thessaly, Æolia,\r\nAttica, and Arcadia.\r\n\r\n[3228] He wrote a work relative to Miletus; but nothing further is\r\nknown of him.\r\n\r\n[3229] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[3230] Probably a writer on geography, of whom no particulars are known.\r\n\r\n[3231] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[3232] Not reckoning under that appellation the country of Egypt,\r\nwhich was more generally looked upon as forming part of Asia. Josephus\r\ninforms us that Africa received its name from Ophir, great-grandson of\r\nAbraham and his second wife, Keturah.\r\n\r\n[3233] ‘Castella,’ fortified places, erected for the purpose of\r\ndefence; not towns formed for the reception of social communities.\r\n\r\n[3234] The Emperor Caligula, who, in the year 41 A.D., reduced the two\r\nMauritanias to Roman provinces, and had King Ptolemy, the son of Juba,\r\nput to death.\r\n\r\n[3235] Now Cape Spartel. By Scylax it is called Hermæum, and by Ptolemy\r\nand Strabo Cote, or Coteis. Pliny means “extreme,” with reference to\r\nthe sea-line of the Mediterranean, in a direction due west.\r\n\r\n[3236] Mentioned again by Pliny in B. xxxii. c. 6. Lissa was so called,\r\naccording to Bochart, from the Hebrew or Phœnician word _liss_, ‘a\r\nlion.’ At the present day there is in this vicinity a headland called\r\nthe ‘Cape of the Lion.’ Bochart thinks that the name ‘Cotta,’ or\r\n‘Cotte,’ was derived from the Hebrew _quothef_, a ‘vine-dresser.’\r\n\r\n[3237] The modern Tangier occupies its site. It was said to have\r\nderived its name from Tinge, the wife of Antæus, the giant, who was\r\nslain by Hercules. His tomb, which formed a hill, in the shape of a man\r\nstretched out at full length, was shown near the town of Tingis to a\r\nlate period. It was also believed, that whenever a portion of the earth\r\ncovering the body was taken away, it rained until the hole was filled\r\nup again. Sertorius is said to have dug away a portion of the hill;\r\nbut, on discovering a skeleton sixty cubits in length, he was struck\r\nwith horror, and had it immediately covered again. Procopius says, that\r\nthe fortress of this place was built by the Canaanites, who were driven\r\nby the Jews out of Palestine.\r\n\r\n[3238] It has been supposed by Salmasius and others of the learned,\r\nthat Pliny by mistake here attributes to Claudius the formation of a\r\ncolony which was really established by either Julius Cæsar or Augustus.\r\nIt is more probable, however, that Claudius, at a later period, ordered\r\nit to be called “Traducta Julia,” or “the removed Colony of Julia,” in\r\nremembrance of a colony having proceeded thence to Spain in the time of\r\nJulius Cæsar. Claudius himself, as stated in the text, established a\r\ncolony here.\r\n\r\n[3239] Its ruins are to be seen at Belonia, or Bolonia, three Spanish\r\nmiles west of the modern Tarifa.\r\n\r\n[3240] At this point Pliny begins his description of the western side\r\nof Africa.\r\n\r\n[3241] Now Arzilla, in the territory of Fez. Ptolemy places it at the\r\nmouth of the river Zileia. It is also mentioned by Strabo and Antoninus.\r\n\r\n[3242] Now El Araiche, or Larache, on the river Lucos.\r\n\r\n[3243] Mentioned again in B. ix. c. 4 and c. 5 of the present Book,\r\nwhere Pliny speaks of them as situate elsewhere. The story of Antæus is\r\nfurther enlarged upon by Solinus, B. xxiv.; Lucan, B. iv. l. 589, _et\r\nseq._; and Martianus Capella, B. vi.\r\n\r\n[3244] Now the Lucos.\r\n\r\n[3245] Hardouin is of opinion, that he here has a hit at Gabinius, a\r\nRoman author, who, in his Annals of Mauritania, as we learn from Strabo\r\n(B. xvii.), inserted numerous marvellous and incredible stories.\r\n\r\n[3246] When we find Pliny accusing other writers of credulity, we are\r\nstrongly reminded of the proverb, ‘Clodius accusat mœchos.’\r\n\r\n[3247] Or the “Julian Colony on the Plains.” Marcus suggests that\r\nthe word _Babba_ may possibly have been derived from the Hebrew\r\nor Phœnician word _beab_ or _beaba_, “situate in a thick forest.”\r\nPoinsinet takes Babba to be the Beni-Tuedi of modern times. D’Anville\r\nthinks that it is Naranja.\r\n\r\n[3248] There is considerable difficulty about the site of Banasa.\r\nMoletius thinks that it is the modern Fanfara, or Pefenfia as Marmol\r\ncalls it. D’Anville suggests that it may be Old Mahmora, on the coast;\r\nbut, on the other hand, Ptolemy places it among the _inland_ cities,\r\nassigning to it a longitude at some distance from the sea. Pliny\r\nalso appears to make it inland, and makes its distance from Lixos\r\nseventy-five miles, while he makes the mouth of the Subur to be fifty\r\nmiles from the same place.\r\n\r\n[3249] From both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. According to\r\nPoinsinet, Volubilis was the synonym of the African name _Fez_,\r\nsignifying a ‘band,’ or ‘swathe.’ Mannert conjectures that it is the\r\nsame as the modern Walili, or Qualili. D’Anville calls it Guulili, and\r\nsays that there are some remains of antiquity there.\r\n\r\n[3250] The modern Subu, or Sebou. D’Anville is of opinion that this\r\nriver has changed a part of its course since the time of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[3251] Most probably the modern Sallee stands on its site.\r\n\r\n[3252] Not in reference to the fact of its existence, but the wonderful\r\nstories which were told respecting it.\r\n\r\n[3253] Like others of the ancient writers, Pliny falls into the error\r\nof considering Atlas, not as an extensive chain of mountains, but as an\r\nisolated mountain, surrounded by sands. With reference to its height,\r\nthe whole range declines considerably from west to east; the highest\r\nsummits in Morocco reaching near 13,000 feet, in Tunis not 5000.\r\n\r\n[3254] Or “Goat-Pans;” probably another name for the Fauni, or Fauns.\r\nMore usually, there is but one Ægipan mentioned,—the son, according to\r\nHyginus, of Zeus or Jupiter, and a goat,—or of Zeus and Æga, the wife\r\nof Pan. As a foundation for one part of the stories here mentioned,\r\nBrotier suggests the fact, that as the Kabyles, or mountain tribes,\r\nare in the habit of retiring to their dwellings and reposing during\r\nthe heat of the day, it would not, consequently, be improbable that\r\nthey would devote the night to their amusements, lighting up fires, and\r\ndancing to the music of drums and cymbals.\r\n\r\n[3255] Under his name we still possess a “Periplus,” or account of\r\na voyage round a part of Libya. The work was originally written in\r\nPunic, but what has come down to us is a Greek translation. We fail,\r\nhowever, to discover any means by which to identify him with any one of\r\nthe many Carthaginians of the same name. Some writers call him king,\r\nand others _dux_, or _imperator_ of the Carthaginians; from which we\r\nmay infer, that he held the office of _suffetes_. This expedition has\r\nby some been placed as far back as the time of the Trojan war, or of\r\nHesiod, while others again place it as late as the reign of Agathocles.\r\nFalconer, Bougainville, and Gail, place the time of Hanno at about B.C.\r\n570, while other critics identify him with Hanno, the father or son of\r\nHamilcar, who was killed at Himera, B.C. 480. Pliny often makes mention\r\nof him; more particularly see B. viii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[3256] M. Gosselin thinks that the spot here indicated was at the\r\nsouth-western extremity of the Atlas range, and upon the northern\r\nfrontier of the Desert of Zahara.\r\n\r\n[3257] Supposed by some geographers to be the same as that now called\r\nthe Ommirabih, or the Om-Rabya. This is also thought by some to have\r\nbeen the same river as is called by Pliny, in p. 381, by the name of\r\nAsana; but the distances do not agree.\r\n\r\n[3258] Supposed by Gosselin to be the present bay of Al-cazar, on the\r\nAfrican coast, in the Straits of Cadiz; though Hardouin takes it to be\r\nthe κόλπος ἐμπορικὸς, or “Gulf of Commerce,” of Strabo and Ptolemy.\r\nBy first quoting from one, and then at a tangent from another, Pliny\r\ninvolves this subject in almost inextricable confusion.\r\n\r\n[3259] Probably the place called Thymiaterion in the Periplus of Hanno.\r\n\r\n[3260] The present Subu, and the river probably of Sallce, previously\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[3261] The modern Mazagan, according to Gosselin.\r\n\r\n[3262] Cape Cantin, according to Gosselin; Cape Blanco, according to\r\nMarcus.\r\n\r\n[3263] Probably the Safi, Asafi, or Saffee of the present day.\r\n\r\n[3264] The river Tensift, which runs close to the city of Morocco, in\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\n[3265] The river Mogador of the present day.\r\n\r\n[3266] The modern river Sus, or Sous.\r\n\r\n[3267] The learned Gosselin has aptly remarked, that this cannot be\r\nother than an error, and that “ninety-six” is the correct reading, the\r\nGulf of Sainte-Croix being evidently the one here referred to.\r\n\r\n[3268] Mount Barce seems to be here a name for the Atlas, or Daran\r\nchain.\r\n\r\n[3269] Supposed by Gosselin to be the present Cape Ger.\r\n\r\n[3270] The river Assa, according to Gosselin. There is also a river\r\nSuse placed here in the maps.\r\n\r\n[3271] These two tribes probably dwelt between the modern Capes Ger and\r\nNon.\r\n\r\n[3272] Marcus believes these to have been the ancestors of the present\r\nrace of the Touaricks, while the Melanogætuli were the progenitors of\r\nthe Tibbos, of a darker complexion, and more nearly resembling the\r\nnegroes in bodily conformation.\r\n\r\n[3273] Supposed by Gosselin to be the present river Nun, or Non.\r\nAccording to Bochart, this river received its name from the Hebrew or\r\nPhœnician word _behemoth_ or _bamoth_, the name by which Job (xl. 15)\r\ncalls the crocodile [or rather the hippopotamus]. Bochart, however,\r\nwith Mannert, Bougainville, De Rennet, and De Heeren, is of opinion,\r\nthat by this name the modern river Senegal is meant. Marcus is of\r\nopinion that it is either the Non or the modern Sobi.\r\n\r\n[3274] Marcus here observes, that from Cape Alfach, below Cape Non,\r\nthere are no mountains, but continual wastes of sand, bordering on the\r\nsea-shore. Indeed there is no headland, of any considerable height,\r\nbetween Cape Sobi and Cape Bajador.\r\n\r\n[3275] “The Chariot of the Gods.” Marcus is of opinion that it is the\r\nmodern Cape Verde; while, on the other hand, Gosselin takes it to be\r\nCape Non. Brotier calls it Cape Ledo.\r\n\r\n[3276] In B. vi. c. 36, Pliny speaks of this promontory as the\r\n“Hesperian Horn,” and says that it is but four days’ sail from the\r\nTheon Ochema. Brotier identifies this promontory with the modern Cape\r\nRoxo. Marcus is of opinion that it was the same as Cape Non; but there\r\nis considerable difficulty in determining its identity.\r\n\r\n[3277] Alluding to Polybius; though, according to the reading which\r\nSillig has adopted a few lines previously, Agrippa is the last author\r\nmentioned. Pliny has here mistaken the meaning of Polybius, who has\r\nplaced Atlas midway between Carthage, from which he had set out, and\r\nthe Promontory of Theon Ochema, which he reached.\r\n\r\n[3278] Ptolemy the son of Juba II. and Cleopatra, was summoned to Rome\r\nin the year A.D. 40, by Caligula, and shortly after put to death by\r\nhim, his riches having excited the emperor’s cupidity. Previously to\r\nthis, he had been on terms of strict alliance with the Roman people,\r\nwho had decreed him a _toga picta_ and a sceptre, as a mark of their\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n[3279] Ivory and citron-wood, or cedar, were used for the making and\r\ninlaying of the tables used by the Roman nobility. See B. xiii. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[3280] Supposed by some geographers to be the modern Wadi-Tensift. It\r\nhas been also confounded with the Anatis (see note [3171], p. 369);\r\nwhile others again identify it with the Anidus. It is more commonly\r\nspelt ‘Asama.’\r\n\r\n[3281] Or Phuth. It does not appear to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[3282] The range is still called by the name of Daran.\r\n\r\n[3283] The same general who afterwards conquered the Britons under\r\nBoadicea or Bonduca. While Proprætor in Mauritania under the Emperor\r\nClaudius, in the year A.D. 42, he defeated the Mauri who had risen in\r\nrevolt, and advanced, as Pliny here states, as far as Mount Atlas. It\r\nis not known from what point Paulinus made his advance towards the\r\nAtlas range. Mannert and Marcus are of opinion that he set out from\r\nSala, the modern Sallee, while Latreille, Malte Brun, and Walkenaer\r\nthink that his point of departure was the mouth of the river Lixos.\r\nSala was the most southerly town on the western coast of Africa that in\r\nthe time of Pliny had submitted to the Roman arms.\r\n\r\n[3284] Some of the editions read ‘Niger’ here. Marcus suggests that\r\nthat river may have been called ‘Niger’ by the Phœnician or Punic\r\ncolonists of the western Mauritania, and ‘Ger’ or ‘Gar’ in another\r\nquarter. The same writer also suggests that the Sigilmessa was the\r\nriver to which Paulinus penetrated on his march beyond Atlas.\r\n\r\n[3285] The Sigilmessa, according to Marmol, flows between several\r\nmountains which appear to be of a blackish hue.\r\n\r\n[3286] Bocchus however, the kinsman of Massinissa, had previously for\r\nsome time reigned over both the Mauritanias, consisting of Mauritania\r\nTingitana and Mauritania Cæsariana.\r\n\r\n[3287] See B. xxv. c. 7. 12, and B. xxvi. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[3288] Extending from the sea to the river Moluga, now called the\r\nMolucha and Molochath, or Malva and Malvana.\r\n\r\n[3289] From whom the Moors of the present day take their name. Marcus\r\nobserves here, that though Pliny distinguishes the Mauri from the\r\nGætuli, they essentially belonged to the same race and spoke the same\r\nlanguage, the so-called Berber, and its dialects, the Schellou and the\r\nSchoviah.\r\n\r\n[3290] ‘Maurusii’ was the Greek name, ‘Mauri’ the Latin, for this\r\npeople. Marcus suggests that Mauri was a synonym only for the Greek\r\nword _nomades_, ‘wanderers.’\r\n\r\n[3291] As Marcus observes, Pliny is here greatly in error. On the\r\ninroads of Paulinus, the Mauri had retreated into the interior and\r\ntaken refuge in the deserts of Zahara, whence they had again emerged in\r\nthe time of the geographer Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[3292] From the time of the second Punic War this people had remained\r\nin undisputed possession of the country situate between the rivers\r\nMolochath or Moluga and Ampsaga, which formed the Cæsarian Mauritania.\r\nPtolemy speaks of finding some remains of them at Siga, a town situate\r\non a river of the same name, and at which King Syphax had formerly\r\nresided.\r\n\r\n[3293] While Pomponius Mela does not make any difference between the\r\nMauri and the Gætuli, Pliny here speaks of them as being essentially\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n[3294] Derived, according to Marcus, from the Arabic compound\r\n_bani-our_, ‘child of nakedness,’ as equivalent to the Greek word\r\n_gymnetes_, by which name Pliny and other ancient writers designate the\r\nwandering naked races of Western Africa.\r\n\r\n[3295] The Autololes or, as Ptolemy calls them, the Autololæ, dwelt, it\r\nis supposed, on the western coast of Africa, between Cape Cantin and\r\nCape Ger. Their city of Autolala or Autolalæ is one of Ptolemy’s points\r\nof astronomical observation, having the longest day thirteen hours\r\nand a half, being distant three hours and a half west of Alexandria,\r\nand having the sun vertical once a year, at the time of the winter\r\nsolstice. Reichard takes it for the modern Agulon or Aquilon.\r\n\r\n[3296] The Æthiopian Daratitæ, Marcus says.\r\n\r\n[3297] The present Ceuta.\r\n\r\n[3298] They were so called from the circumstance, Marcus says, of their\r\npeaks being so numerous, and so strongly resembling each other. They\r\nare now called, according to D’Anville, ‘Gebel Mousa,’ which means “the\r\nMountain of Apes,” an animal by which they are now much frequented,\r\ninstead of by elephants as in Pliny’s time.\r\n\r\n[3299] Or Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[3300] The modern Bedia, according to Olivarius, the Tasanel, according\r\nto Dupinet, and the Alamos or Kerkal, according to Ansart. Marcus says\r\nthat it is called the Setuan, and is the largest stream on the northern\r\nshores of Western Africa.\r\n\r\n[3301] The modern Gomera according to Hardouin, the Nocor according to\r\nMannert.\r\n\r\n[3302] The modern Melilla most probably.\r\n\r\n[3303] The modern Maluia. Antoninus calls it Malva, and Ptolemy Maloua.\r\n\r\n[3304] Its site is occupied by the modern Aresgol, according to\r\nMariana, Guardia or Sereni according to Dupinet, Ned-Roma according\r\nto Mannert and D’Anville, and Tachumbrit according to Shaw. Marcus is\r\ninclined to be of the same opinion as the last-mentioned geographer.\r\n\r\n[3305] Now the city of Malaga.\r\n\r\n[3306] Mauritania Cæsariensis, or Cæsarian Mauritania, now forming the\r\nFrench province of Algiers.\r\n\r\n[3307] “Bogudiana;” from Bogud or Bogoas. The last king Bogud was\r\ndeprived of his kingdom by Bocchus, king of Mauritania Cæsariensis, a\r\nwarm partisan of Cæsar.\r\n\r\n[3308] Or the “Great Harbour,” now Arzeu according to D’Anville, and\r\nMars-el-Kebir according to Marcus.\r\n\r\n[3309] The same river probably as the Malva or Malvana previously\r\nmentioned, the word _mulucha_ or _malacha_ coming from the Greek\r\nμολόχη, “a marsh mallow,” which _malva_, as a Latin word, also\r\nsignifies. See p. 383.\r\n\r\n[3310] From the Greek word ξένος, “a stranger.” Pomponius Mela and\r\nAntoninus call this place Guiza, and Ptolemy Quisa. D’Anville places it\r\non the right side of the river Malvana or Mulucha, and Shaw says that\r\nit was situate in the vicinity of the modern town of Oran.\r\n\r\n[3311] Now Marz-Agolet, or situate in its vicinity, according to\r\nHardouin and Ansart, and the present Arzen, according to Marcus, where\r\nnumerous remains of antiquity are found.\r\n\r\n[3312] Now Tenez, according to D’Anville, and Mesgraïm, according to\r\nMannert; with which last opinion Marcus agrees.\r\n\r\n[3313] Ptolemy and Antoninus place this colony to the east of the\r\nPromontory of Apollo, and not the west as Pliny does.\r\n\r\n[3314] The present Cape Mestagan.\r\n\r\n[3315] According to Dupinet and Mannert, the modern Tenez occupies\r\nits site, Zershell according to Hardouin and Shaw, Vacur according to\r\nD’Anville and Ansart, and Algiers according to others. It is suggested\r\nby Marcus that the name Iol is derived from the Arabic verb _galla_,\r\n“to be noble” or “famous.” There is no doubt that the magnificent ruins\r\nat Zershell are those of Iol, and that its name is an abbreviation of\r\nCæsarea Iol.\r\n\r\n[3316] Or New Town.\r\n\r\n[3317] Scylax calls it Thapsus; Ammianus Marcellinus, Tiposa. According\r\nto Mannert it was situate in the vicinity of the modern Damas.\r\n\r\n[3318] Or Icosium. It has been identified by inscriptions discovered\r\nby the French as standing on the same site as the modern Algiers.\r\nD’Anville, Mannert and others identify it with Scherchell or Zershell,\r\nthus placing it too far west. Mannert was evidently misled by an error\r\nin the Antonine Itinerary, whereby all the places along this coast are,\r\nfor a considerable distance, thrown too far to the west; the researches\r\nhowever which followed the French conquest of the country have revealed\r\ninscriptions which completely set the question at rest.\r\n\r\n[3319] According to Mannert, this was situate on the modern Cape\r\nArbatel. Marcus thinks that the Hebrew _ros_, or Arab _ras_, “a rock,”\r\nenters into the composition of the word.\r\n\r\n[3320] Now Hur according to D’Anville, Colcah according to Mannert.\r\n\r\n[3321] The modern Acor, according to Marcus.\r\n\r\n[3322] The modern Pedeles or Delys, according to Ortellius and Mannert,\r\nTedles according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[3323] The modern Jigeli or Gigeri. It was probably in ancient times\r\nthe emporium of the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n[3324] Destroyed, according to Hardouin, and probably by the incursions\r\nof the sea. At the mouth of the Ampsaga (now called the Wad-El-Kebir\r\nor Sufjimar, and higher up the Wadi Roumel) there is situate a small\r\nsea-port called Marsa Zeitoun.\r\n\r\n[3325] Near the present Mazuaa, according to Mannert.\r\n\r\n[3326] The modern Burgh, according to D’Anville and Mannert, but more\r\nprobably considerably to the east of that place.\r\n\r\n[3327] The modern El-Herba, according to Mannert.\r\n\r\n[3328] Marcus suggests that this is the Chinalaph of Ptolemy, and\r\nprobably the modern Schellif.\r\n\r\n[3329] The same that is called Savis by Ptolemy, who places Icosium on\r\nits banks.\r\n\r\n[3330] By Mela called the Vabar. Marcus supposes it to be the same as\r\nthe modern Giffer.\r\n\r\n[3331] By Ptolemy called the Sisar; the Ajebbi of modern geographers,\r\nwhich falls into the Mediterranean, near the city of Budja.\r\n\r\n[3332] Brotier says that this reading is incorrect, and that 222 is the\r\nproper one, that being the true distance between the river Ampsaga or\r\nWad-el-Kebir and the city of Cæsarea, the modern Zershell.\r\n\r\n[3333] It was not only Numidia that bore this name, but all the\r\nnorthern coast of Africa from the frontiers of the kingdom of Carthage\r\nnear Hippo Regius to the Columns of Hercules. It was thus called\r\nfrom the Greek _metagonos_, a “descendant” or “successor;” as the\r\nCarthaginians established a number of small towns and villages on the\r\ncoast, which were thus posterior in their origin to the large cities\r\nalready founded there.\r\n\r\n[3334] Hardouin says that the Moors in the interior still follow the\r\nsame usage, carrying their houses from pasture to pasture on waggons.\r\n\r\n[3335] Now Chollum or Collo.\r\n\r\n[3336] The modern Sgigada or Stora, according to Mannert, D’Anville,\r\nand Shaw.\r\n\r\n[3337] The modern Constantina occupies its site. Numerous remains of\r\nthe ancient town are still discovered. Sitius was an officer who served\r\nunder Cæsar, and obtained a grant of this place after the defeat of\r\nJuba.\r\n\r\n[3338] Called Urbs, or Kaff, according to D’Anville and Shaw; the\r\nlatter of whom found an inscription there with the words _Ordo\r\nSiccensium_.\r\n\r\n[3339] Or ‘Royal Bulla’; which epithet shows that it was either a\r\nresidence or a foundation of the kings of Numidia, and distinguishes\r\nit from a small place called Bulla Mensa, south of Carthage. Bulla\r\nRegia was four days’ journey south-west of Carthage, on a tributary of\r\nthe river Bagrada, the valley of which is still called Wad-el-Boul.\r\nThis place was one of the points of Ptolemy’s recorded astronomical\r\nobservations, having its longest day fourteen hours and one-eighth, and\r\nbeing distant from Alexandria two hours to the west.\r\n\r\n[3340] The modern Tamseh, according to Shaw and Mannert, and Tagodet,\r\naccording to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[3341] Its ruins are south of the modern Bona. It received the name of\r\n_Regius_ or ‘Royal’ from being the residence of the Numidian kings. It\r\nwas also famed as being the see of St. Augustine. It was a colony of\r\nTyre, and stood on the bay now forming the Gulf of Bona. It was one\r\nof the most flourishing cities of Africa till it was destroyed by the\r\nVandals A.D. 430.\r\n\r\n[3342] Now the Mafragg, according to Mannert.\r\n\r\n[3343] Still called Tabarca, according to Hardouin.\r\n\r\n[3344] Now the Zaina, according to Marcus.\r\n\r\n[3345] For the character of the Numidian marble, see Pliny, B. xxxvi.\r\nc. 7.\r\n\r\n[3346] Extending from the river Tusca, or Zaina, to the northern\r\nfrontiers of Byzacium. It corresponds with the Turkish province or\r\nbeylik of Tunis.\r\n\r\n[3347] He says this not only to distinguish it from Africa, considered\r\nas one-third of the globe, but also in contradistinction to the\r\nproconsular province of the Roman empire of the same name, which\r\ncontained not only the province of Zeugitana, but also those of\r\nNumidia, Byzacium, and Tripolis.\r\n\r\n[3348] Candidum: now Ras-el-Abiad.\r\n\r\n[3349] The references to this headland identify it with Cape Farina, or\r\nRas Sidi Ali-al-Mekhi, and not, as some have thought, the more westerly\r\nCape Zibeeb or Ras Sidi Bou-Shoushe. Shaw however applies the name of\r\nZibeeb to the former.\r\n\r\n[3350] Now Cape Bon, or Ras-Addar.\r\n\r\n[3351] More properly called Hippo Diarrhytus or Zaritus, a Tyrian\r\ncolony, situate on a large lake which communicated with the sea, and\r\nreceived the waters of another lake. Its situation exposed it to\r\nfrequent inundations, whence, as the Greeks used to state, the epithet\r\nδιάῤῥυτος. It seems more probable however that this is the remnant of\r\nsome Phœnician title, as the ancients were not agreed on the true form\r\nof the name, and of this uncertainty we have a further proof in the\r\n_Hippo Dirutus_ of our author.\r\n\r\n[3352] This is placed by Ptolemy to the south-east of Hippo, and near\r\nthe southern extremity of Lake Sisar.\r\n\r\n[3353] This important city stood on the north part of the Carthaginian\r\nGulf, west of the mouth of the Bagrada, and twenty-seven Roman miles\r\nN.W. of Carthage; but the site of its ruins at the modern Bou-Shater\r\nis now inland, in consequence of the changes made by the Bagrada\r\nin the coast-line. In the Third Punic war Utica took part with the\r\nRomans against Carthage, and was rewarded with the greater part of the\r\nCarthaginian territory.\r\n\r\n[3354] Now called the Mejerdah, and though of very inconsiderable\r\nsize, the chief river of the Carthaginian territory. The main stream\r\nis formed by the union of two branches, the southern of which, the\r\nancient Bagrada, is now called the Mellig, and in its upper course the\r\nMeskianah. The other branch is called the Hamiz.\r\n\r\n[3355] Or the “Cornelian Camp.” The spot where Cornelius Scipio\r\nAfricanus the Elder first encamped, on landing in Africa, B.C. 204.\r\nCæsar describes this spot, in his description of Curio’s operations\r\nagainst Utica, B. C. b. ii. c. 24, 25. This spot is now called Ghellah.\r\n\r\n[3356] This colony was first established by Caius Gracchus, who sent\r\n6000 settlers to found on the site of Carthage the new city of Junonia.\r\nThe Roman senate afterwards annulled this with the other acts of\r\nGracchus. Under Augustus however the new city of Carthage was founded,\r\nwhich, when Strabo wrote, was as prosperous as any city in Africa. It\r\nwas made, in place of Utica, which had favoured the Pompeian party,\r\nthe seat of the proconsul of Old Africa. It stood on the peninsula\r\nterminated by Ras-Sidi-Bou-Said, Cape Carthage or Carthagena. As Gibbon\r\nhas remarked, “The place might be unknown if some broken arches of an\r\naqueduct did not guide the footsteps of the inquisitive traveller.”\r\n\r\n[3357] The original city of Carthage was called ‘Carthago Magna’ to\r\ndistinguish it from New Carthage and Old Carthage, colonies in Spain.\r\n\r\n[3358] Now Rhades, according to Marcus.\r\n\r\n[3359] Marcus identifies it with the modern Gurtos.\r\n\r\n[3360] By the Greeks called ‘Aspis.’ It derived its Greek and Roman\r\nnames from its site on a hill of a shield-like shape. It was built by\r\nAgathocles, the Sicilian, B.C. 310. In the first Punic war it was the\r\nlanding-place of Manlius and Regulus, whose first action was to take\r\nit, B.C. 256. Its site is still known as Kalebiah, and its ruins are\r\npeculiarly interesting. The site of Misua is occupied by Sidi-Doud,\r\naccording to Shaw and D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[3361] Shaw informs us that an inscription found on the spot designates\r\nthis place as a colony, not a free city or town. Its present name is\r\nKurbah.\r\n\r\n[3362] The present Nabal, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[3363] Zeugitana extended from the river Tusca to Horrea-Cælia, and\r\nByzacium from this last place to Thenæ.\r\n\r\n[3364] As sprung partly from the Phœnician immigrants, and partly from\r\nthe native Libyans or Africans.\r\n\r\n[3365] Pliny says, B. xvii. c. 3, “A hundred and fifty fold.” From Shaw\r\nwe learn that this fertility no longer exists, the fields producing not\r\nmore than eight- or at most twelve-fold.\r\n\r\n[3366] The modern Lempta occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[3367] Originally a Phœnician colony, older than Carthage. It was the\r\ncapital of Byzacium, and stood within the southern extremity of the\r\nSinus Neapolitanus or Gulf of Hammamet. Trajan made it a colony, under\r\nthe high-sounding name, as we gather from inscriptions, of _Colonia\r\nConcordia Ulpia Trajana Augusta Frugifera Hadrumetana_, or, as set\r\nforth on coins, _Colonia Concordia Julia Hadrumetana Pia_. The epithet\r\n_Frugifera_ refers to the fact that it was one of the chief sea-ports\r\nfor the corn-producing country of Byzacium. It was destroyed by the\r\nVandals, but restored by the Emperor Justinian under the name of\r\nJustiniana or Justinianopolis. The modern Sousa stands on its site; and\r\nbut slight traces of the ancient city are to be found.\r\n\r\n[3368] Situate in the vicinity of the modern Monastir.\r\n\r\n[3369] Shaw discovered its ruins at the modern town of Demas.\r\n\r\n[3370] Now Taineh, according to D’Anville. This place formed the\r\nboundary between the proconsular province of Africa and the territory\r\nof the Numidian king Masinissa and his descendants.\r\n\r\n[3371] The present Mahometa, according to Marcus, El Mahres according\r\nto D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[3372] Now Cabès, according to D’Anville, giving name to the Gulf of\r\nCabès. Marcus calls it Gaps.\r\n\r\n[3373] Now Tripoli Vecchio; also called Sabart according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[3374] Scipio Æmilianus, the son-in-law of Æmilius Paulus.\r\n\r\n[3375] Micipsa, the son of Masinissa, and his two legitimate brethren.\r\nScipio having been left by Masinissa executor of his will, the\r\nsovereign power was divided by him between Micipsa and his two brethren\r\nGulussa and Mastanabal. On this occasion also he separated Numidia from\r\nZeugitana and Byzacium, by a long dyke drawn from Thenæ, due south,\r\nto the borders of the Great Desert, and thence in a north-westerly\r\ndirection to the river Tusca.\r\n\r\n[3376] The Syrtes or ‘Quicksands’ are now called, the Lesser Syrtes the\r\nGulf of Cabès, and the Greater the Gulf of Sydra. The country situate\r\nbetween the two Syrtes is called Tripoli, formerly Tripolis, a name\r\nwhich, according to Solinus, it owed to its three cities, Sabrata,\r\nLeptis, and Œa.\r\n\r\n[3377] Marcus observes with reference to this passage, that both\r\nHardouin and Poinsinet have mistaken its meaning. They evidently think\r\nthat Pliny is speaking here of a route to the Syrtes leading from the\r\ninterior of Africa, whereas it is pretty clear that he is speaking\r\nof the dangers which attend those who approach it by the line of the\r\nsea-coast, as Cato did, on his march to Utica, so beautifully described\r\nby Lucan in his Ninth Book. This is no doubt the same route which was\r\ntaken by the caravans on their passage from Lebida, the ancient Leptis,\r\nto Berenice in Cyrenaica.\r\n\r\n[3378] Those which we find at the middle of the coast bordering upon\r\nthe Greater Syrtis, and which separate the mountains of Fezzan and\r\nAtlas from Cyrenaica and Barca.\r\n\r\n[3379] In its widest sense this name is applied to all the Libyan\r\ntribes inhabiting the Oases on the eastern part of the Great Desert,\r\nas the Gætulians inhabited its western part, the boundary between the\r\ntwo nations being drawn at the sources of the Bagrada and the mountain\r\nUsargala. In the stricter sense however, and in which the term must be\r\nhere understood, the name ‘Garamantes’ denoted the people of Phazania,\r\nthe modern Fezzan, which forms by far the largest oasis in the Grand\r\nDesert of Zahara.\r\n\r\n[3380] Augylæ, now Aujelah, was an oasis in the desert of Barca, in the\r\nregion of Cyrenaica, about 3-1/2° south of Cyrene. It has been remarked\r\nthat Pliny, here and in the Eighth Chapter of the present Book, in\r\nabridging the account given by Herodotus of the tribes of Northern\r\nAfrica, has transferred to the Augylæ what that author really says\r\nof the Nasamones. This oasis forms one of the chief stations on the\r\ncaravan route from Cairo to Fezzan. It is placed by Rennell in 30° 3′\r\nNorth Lat. and 22° 46′ East Long., 180 miles south-east of Barca, 180\r\nwest by north of Siwah, the ancient Ammonium, and 426 east by north of\r\nMourzouk. Later authorities, however, place the village of Aujelah in\r\n29° 15′ North Lat. and 21° 55′ East Long.\r\n\r\n[3381] For an account of the Psylli see B. vii. c. 2. They probably\r\ndwelt in the vicinity of the modern Cape Mesurata.\r\n\r\n[3382] Now Lake Lynxama, according to Marcus.\r\n\r\n[3383] Marcus observes that in order properly to understand this\r\npassage we must remember that the ancients considered Africa as\r\nterminating north of the Equator, and imagined that from the Straits of\r\nHercules the western coast of Africa ran, not towards the south-west,\r\nbut slanted in a south-easterly direction to the Straits of Babelmandel.\r\n\r\n[3384] The modern Tripoli.\r\n\r\n[3385] A flourishing city with a mixed population of Libyans and\r\nSicilians. It was at this place that Apuleius made his eloquent and\r\ningenious defence against the charge of sorcery brought against him by\r\nhis step-sons. According to some writers the modern Tripoli is built on\r\nits site, while other accounts make it to have been situate six leagues\r\nfrom that city.\r\n\r\n[3386] Now called the Wady-el-Quaham.\r\n\r\n[3387] Mannert is of opinion that this was only another name for the\r\ncity of Leptis Magna or the “Greater Leptis” here mentioned by Pliny.\r\nThere is little doubt that his supposition is correct.\r\n\r\n[3388] The more common reading is Taphra or Taphara. D’Anville\r\nidentifies it with the town of Sfakes.\r\n\r\n[3389] Scylax identifies it with Neapolis or Leptis, and it is\r\ngenerally looked upon as being the same place as Sabrata or Old Tripoli.\r\n\r\n[3390] Now called Lebida. It was the birth-place of the Emperor\r\nSeptimius Severus. It was almost destroyed by an attack from a Libyan\r\ntribe A.D. 366, and its ruin was completed by the invasion of the\r\nArabs. Its ruins are considerable.\r\n\r\n[3391] “Men of sea complexion,” is the meaning of this Greek name.\r\nAccording to Marcus they dwelt between the Greater Leptis and the Lake\r\nTritonis, at the present day called Schibkah-el-Loudeah. For a further\r\naccount of the Lotophagi, see B. xiii. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[3392] Two brothers, citizens of Carthage, who in a dispute as to\r\ntheir respective territories with the people of Cyrene, submitted to\r\nbe buried alive in the sand, at the boundary-line between the two\r\ncountries. Sallust (Jugurthine War) is the main authority for the\r\nstory. It is also related by Pomponius Mela, B. i. c. 7, and Valerius\r\nMaximus, B. v. c. 6, but from the Greek name of the brothers, meaning\r\n“lovers of praise,” it is doubtful whether the story is not of spurious\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n[3393] The Lake Tritonis mentioned in note [3391], p. 393.\r\n\r\n[3394] Now called El Hammah, according to Shaw.\r\n\r\n[3395] According to some accounts the goddess Pallas or Minerva was\r\nborn on the banks of Lake Tritonis.\r\n\r\n[3396] The modern Cape of Tajuni.\r\n\r\n[3397] Now called Udina, according to Marcus.\r\n\r\n[3398] Now called Tabersole, according to Marcus.\r\n\r\n[3399] In the north of Byzacium, near the Bagrada and the confines\r\nof Numidia. It was the station of a Roman garrison, and considerable\r\nremains of it are still visible near the modern Zanfour.\r\n\r\n[3400] Called Cannopissæ by Ptolemy, who places it to the east of\r\nTabraca.\r\n\r\n[3401] There is great doubt as to the correct orthography of these\r\nplaces, most of which can be no longer identified.\r\n\r\n[3402] According to Marcus the present Porto Tarina.\r\n\r\n[3403] Also called Achilla and Achulla, the ruins of which are to be\r\nseen at the modern El Aliah. It stood on the sea-coast of Byzacium,\r\na little above the northern extremity of the Lesser Syrtis. It was a\r\ncolony from the island of Melita, now Malta.\r\n\r\n[3404] Now called El-Jemma, according to Marcus.\r\n\r\n[3405] From it modern Tunis takes its name.\r\n\r\n[3406] The birth-place of St. Augustin. It was to the north-west of\r\nHippo Regius.\r\n\r\n[3407] In the vicinity of this place, if it is the same as the Tigisis\r\nmentioned by Procopius, there were two columns to be seen in his day,\r\nupon which was written in the Phœnician language, “We fled from before\r\nthe robber, Joshua the son of Nun.”\r\n\r\n[3408] There were two towns of this name in the proconsular province\r\nof Africa. The first was situate in the country of Zeugitana, five\r\ndays’ journey west of Carthage, and it was here that Scipio defeated\r\nHannibal. The other bore the surname of _Regia_ or Royal, from being\r\nthe frequent residence of the Numidian kings. It lay in the interior,\r\nand at the present day its site bears the name of ‘Zowarin’ or\r\n‘Zewarin.’\r\n\r\n[3409] The ruins of Capsa still bear the name of Cafsa or Ghafsah.\r\nIt was an important city in the extreme south of Numidia, situate in\r\nan oasis, in the midst of an arid desert abounding in serpents. In\r\nthe Jugurthine war it was the treasury of Jugurtha, and was taken and\r\ndestroyed by Marius; but was afterwards rebuilt and made a colony.\r\n\r\n[3410] They dwelt between the river Ampsaga or Wady-El-Kebir and the\r\nTusca or Wady-Zain, the western boundary of the Carthaginian territory.\r\n\r\n[3411] Dwelling to the east of the mountain Zalycus, now known as the\r\nWanashrise, according to Shaw.\r\n\r\n[3412] The ancients called by the name of ‘Gætulians’ all the people of\r\nAfrica who dwelt south of the Mauritanias and Numidia, as far as the\r\nline which, according to their ideas, separated Africa from Æthiopia.\r\n\r\n[3413] The Quorra most probably of modern geographers.\r\n\r\n[3414] So called, as mentioned below, from its five principal cities.\r\n\r\n[3415] Where Jupiter Ammon or Hammon was worshiped under the form of\r\na ram, the form he was said to have assumed when the deities were\r\ndispersed in the war with the Giants. Ancient Ammonium is the present\r\noasis of Siwah in the Libyan Desert.\r\n\r\n[3416] The same that has been already mentioned in B. ii. c. 106. It is\r\nmentioned by Herodotus and Pomponius Mela.\r\n\r\n[3417] Previously called Hesperis or Hesperides. It was the most\r\nwesterly city of Cyrenaica, and stood just beyond the eastern extremity\r\nof the Greater Syrtis, on a promontory called Pseudopenias, and near\r\nthe river Lethon. Its historical importance only dates from the times\r\nof the Ptolemies, when it was named Berenice, after the wife of Ptolemy\r\nIII. or Euergetes. Having been greatly reduced, it was fortified anew\r\nby the Emperor Justinian. Its ruins are to be seen at the modern Ben\r\nGhazi.\r\n\r\n[3418] So called from Arsinoë, the sister of Ptolemy Philadelphus.\r\nIts earlier name was Taucheira or Teucheira, which name, according to\r\nMarcus, it still retains.\r\n\r\n[3419] Its ruins may still be seen at Tolmeita or Tolometa. It was\r\nsituate on the N.W. coast of Cyrenaica, and originally bore the name of\r\nBarca. From which of the Ptolemies it took its name is not known. Its\r\nsplendid ruins are not less than four miles in circumference.\r\n\r\n[3420] Its ruins are still to be seen, bespeaking its former splendour,\r\nat the modern Marsa Sousah. It was originally only the port of Cyrene,\r\nbut under the Ptolemies it flourished to such an extent as to eclipse\r\nthat city. It is pretty certain that it was the Sozusa of the later\r\nGreek writers. Eratosthenes was a native of this place.\r\n\r\n[3421] The chief city of Cyrenaica, and the most important Hellenic\r\ncolony in Africa, the early settlers having extensively intermarried\r\nwith wives of Libyan parentage. In its most prosperous times it\r\nmaintained an extensive commerce with Greece and Egypt, especially in\r\nsilphium or assafœtida, the plantations of which, as mentioned in the\r\npresent chapter, extended for miles in its vicinity. Great quantities\r\nof this plant were also exported to Capua in Southern Italy, where it\r\nwas extensively employed in the manufacture of perfumes. The scene of\r\nthe ‘Rudens,’ the most picturesque (if we may use the term) of the\r\nplays of Plautus, is laid in the vicinity of Cyrene, and frequent\r\nreference is made in it to the extensive cultivation of silphium;\r\na head of which plant also appears on the coins of the place. The\r\nphilosophers Aristippus and Carneades were born here, as also the poet\r\nCallimachus. Its ruins, at the modern Ghrennah, are very extensive, and\r\nare indicative of its former splendour.\r\n\r\n[3422] In C. 1 of the present Book. It was only the poetical fancy\r\nof the Greeks that found the fabled gardens of the Hesperides in the\r\nfertile regions of Cyrenaica. Scylax distinctly mentions the gardens\r\nand the lake of the Hesperides in this vicinity, where we also find\r\na people called Hesperidæ, or, as Herodotus names them, Euesperidæ.\r\nIt was probably in consequence of this similarity of name, in a great\r\ndegree, that the gardens of the Hesperides were assigned to this\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\n[3423] Now called Ras-Sem or Ras-El-Kazat. It is situate a little to\r\nthe west of Apollonia and N.W. of Cyrene.\r\n\r\n[3424] According to Ansart, 264 miles is the real distance between\r\nCapes Ras-Sem and Tænarum or Matapan\r\n\r\n[3425] As already mentioned, Apollonia formed the harbour of Cyrene.\r\n\r\n[3426] This was called the Chersonesus Magna, being so named in\r\ncontradistinction to the Chersonesus Parva, on the coast of Egypt,\r\nabout thirty-five miles west of Alexandria. It is now called\r\nRas-El-Tin, or more commonly Raxatin.\r\n\r\n[3427] So called from the peculiar features of the locality, the Greek\r\nword καταβαθμὸς, signifying “a descent.” A deep valley, bounded east\r\nand west by ranges of high hills, runs from this spot to the frontiers\r\nof Egypt. It is again mentioned by Pliny at the end of the present\r\nChapter. The spot is still known by a similar name, being called Marsa\r\nSollern, or the “Port of the Ladder.” In earlier times the Egyptian\r\nterritory ended at the Gulf of Plinthinethes, now Lago Segio, and did\r\nnot extend so far as Catabathmos.\r\n\r\n[3428] This name was unknown to Herodotus. As Marcus observes, it was\r\nprobably of Phœnician origin, signifying “leading a wandering life,”\r\nlike the term “nomad,” derived from the Greek.\r\n\r\n[3429] Now called El Bareton or Marsa-Labeit. This city was of\r\nconsiderable importance, and belonged properly to Marmaria, but was\r\nincluded politically in the Nomos Libya of Egypt. It stood near the\r\npromontory of Artos or Pythis, now Ras-El-Hazeit.\r\n\r\n[3430] So called from the words _Matâ-Ammon_, “the tribe of Ammon,”\r\naccording to Bochart. The Nasamones were a powerful but savage people\r\nof Libya, who dwelt originally on the shores of the Greater Syrtis, but\r\nwere driven inland by the Greek settlers of Cyrenaica, and afterwards\r\nby the Romans.\r\n\r\n[3431] From μεσὸς “the middle,” and ἄμμος “sand.”\r\n\r\n[3432] See note [3421] in p. 396.\r\n\r\n[3433] Herodotus places this nation to the west of the Nasamones and on\r\nthe river Cinyps, now called the Wadi-Quaham.\r\n\r\n[3434] In most of the editions they are called ‘Hammanientes.’ It has\r\nbeen suggested that they were so called from the Greek word ἄμμος\r\n“sand.”\r\n\r\n[3435] This story he borrows from Herodotus, B. iv. c. 158.\r\n\r\n[3436] From the Greek word τρωγλοδύται, “dwellers in caves.” Pliny has\r\nused the term already (B. iv. c. 25) in reference to the nations on\r\nthe banks of the Danube. It was a general name applied by the Greek\r\ngeographers to various uncivilized races who had no abodes but caves,\r\nand more especially to the inhabitants of the western coasts of the Red\r\nSea, along the shores of Upper Egypt and Æthiopia.\r\n\r\n[3437] At the beginning of C. 4.\r\n\r\n[3438] Which gives name to the modern Fezzan.\r\n\r\n[3439] Now called Tanet-Mellulen, or the station of Mellulen, on the\r\nroute from Gadamez to Oserona.\r\n\r\n[3440] Zaouila or Zala, half way between Augyla and Mourzouk.\r\n\r\n[3441] Now Gadamez, which, according to Marcus, is situate almost under\r\nthe same meridian as Old Tripoli, the ancient Sabrata.\r\n\r\n[3442] According to Marcus this range still bears the name of\r\nGibel-Assoud, which in the Arabic language means the “Black Mountain.”\r\n\r\n[3443] In a southerly direction. He alludes probably to the Desert of\r\nBildulgerid.\r\n\r\n[3444] This spring is also mentioned by Pliny in B. ii. c. 106. Marcus\r\nsuggests that the Debris of Pliny is the same as the Bedir of Ptolemy.\r\nHe also remarks that the English traveller Oudney discovered caverns\r\nhewn out of the sides of the hills, evidently for the purposes of\r\nhabitation, but of which the use is not known by the present people.\r\nThese he considers to have been the abodes of the ancient Troglodytæ or\r\n“cave-dwellers.” In the Tibesti range of mountains, however, we find a\r\nrace called the Rock Tibboos, from the circumstance of their dwelling\r\nin caves.\r\n\r\n[3445] Cornelius Balbus Gaditanus the Younger, who, upon his victories\r\nover the Garamantes, obtained a triumph in the year B.C. 19.\r\n\r\n[3446] L. Cornelius Balbus the Elder, also a native of Gades. He\r\nobtained the consulship in B.C. 40, the first instance, as we find\r\nmentioned by Pliny, B. vii. c. 44, in which this honour had been\r\nconferred upon one who was not a Roman citizen.\r\n\r\n[3447] On the occasion of a triumph by a Roman general, boards were\r\ncarried aloft on “fercula,” on which were painted in large letters\r\nthe names of vanquished nations and countries. Here too models were\r\nexhibited in ivory or wood of the cities and forts captured, and\r\npictures of the mountains, rivers, and other great natural features\r\nof the subjugated region, with appropriate inscriptions. Marcus is of\r\nopinion that the names of the places here mentioned do not succeed\r\nin any geographical order, but solely according to their presumed\r\nimportance as forming part of the conquest of Balbus. He also thinks\r\nthat Balbus did not penetrate beyond the fifteenth degree of north\r\nlatitude, and that his conquests did not extend so far south as the\r\nbanks of Lake Tchad.\r\n\r\n[3448] The site of Garama still bears the name of ‘Gherma,’ and\r\npresents very considerable remains of antiquity. It is four days’\r\njourney north of Mourzouk, the capital of Fezzan.\r\n\r\n[3449] Now Tibesti, according to Marcus.\r\n\r\n[3450] Marcus suggests that this is probably the Febabo of modern\r\ngeographers, to the N.E. of Belma and Tibesti.\r\n\r\n[3451] Discera was the Im-Zerah of modern travellers, on the road from\r\nSockna to Mourzouk, according to Marcus, who is of opinion that the\r\nplaces which follow were situate at the east and north-east of Thuben\r\nand the Black Mountain.\r\n\r\n[3452] Om-El-Abid, to the N.W. of Garama or Gherma, according to\r\nMarcus, and Oudney the traveller.\r\n\r\n[3453] The same, Marcus thinks, as the modern Tessava in Fezzan.\r\n\r\n[3454] Marcus suggests that this may be the modern Sana.\r\n\r\n[3455] The town of Winega mentioned by Oudney, was probably the ancient\r\nPega, according to Marcus.\r\n\r\n[3456] The modern Missolat, according to Marcus, on the route from\r\nTripoli to Murmuck.\r\n\r\n[3457] According to Marcus, this was the Mount Goriano of the English\r\ntravellers Denham, Clapperton, and Oudney, where, confirming the\r\nstatement here made by Pliny, they found quartz, jasper, onyx, agates,\r\nand cornelians.\r\n\r\n[3458] Mentioned by Tacitus, B. iv. c. 50. The town of Œa has been\r\nalluded to by Pliny in C. 4.\r\n\r\n[3459] “Past the head of the rock.” Marcus suggests that this is the\r\nGibel-Gelat or Rock of Gelat spoken of by the English travellers\r\nDenham, Clapperton, and Oudney, forming a portion of the chain of\r\nGuriano or Gyr. He says, that at the foot of this mountain travellers\r\nhave to pass from Old and New Tripoli on their road to Missolat, the\r\nMaxala of Pliny, and thence to Gerama or Gherma, the ancient capital of\r\nFezzan.\r\n\r\n[3460] As Marcus observes, this would not make it to extend so far\r\nsouth as the sixteenth degree of north latitude.\r\n\r\n[3461] The Mareotis of the time of the Ptolemies extended from\r\nAlexandria to the Gulf of Plinthinethes; and Libya was properly that\r\nportion of territory which extended from that Gulf to Catabathmos.\r\nPliny is in error here in confounding the two appellations, or rather,\r\nblending them into one. It includes the eastern portion of the modern\r\nBarca, and the western division of Lower Egypt. It most probably\r\nreceived its name from the Lake Mareotis, and not the lake from it.\r\n\r\n[3462] This was a seaport town on the northern coast of Africa,\r\nprobably about eleven or twelve miles west of Parætonium, sometimes\r\nspoken of as belonging to Egypt, sometimes to Marmorica. Scylax places\r\nit at the western boundary of Egypt, on the frontier of the Marmaridæ.\r\nPtolemy, like Pliny, speaks of it as being in the Libyan Nomos. The\r\ndistances given in the MSS. of Pliny of this place from Parætonium are\r\nseventy-two, sixty-two, and twelve miles; the latter is probably the\r\ncorrect reading, as Strabo, B. xvii., makes the distance 100 stadia. It\r\nis extremely doubtful whether the Apis mentioned by Herodotus, B. ii.\r\nc. 18, can be the same place: but there is little doubt, from the words\r\nof Pliny here, that it was dedicated to the worship of the Egyptian god\r\nApis, who was represented under the form of a bull.\r\n\r\n[3463] Now called Zerbi and Jerba, derived from the name of Girba,\r\nwhich even in the time of Aurelius Victor, had supplanted that of\r\nMeninx. It is situate in the Gulf of Cabes. According to Solinus, C.\r\nMarius lay in concealment here for some time. It was famous for its\r\npurple. See B. ix. c. 60.\r\n\r\n[3464] Now called Kerkéni, Karkenah, or Ramlah.\r\n\r\n[3465] Now Gherba. It was reckoned as a mere appendage to Cercina, to\r\nwhich it was joined by a mole, and which is found often mentioned in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[3466] Still called Lampedusa, off the coast of Tunis. This island,\r\nwith Gaulos and Galata, has been already mentioned among the islands\r\noff Sicily; see B. iii. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[3467] Now Pantellaria. See B. iii. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[3468] A lofty island surrounded by dangerous cliffs, now called\r\nZowamour or Zembra.\r\n\r\n[3469] In the former editions the word “Aræ” is taken to refer to the\r\nÆgimuri, as meaning the same islands. Sillig is however of opinion that\r\ntotally distinct groups are meant, and punctuates accordingly. The\r\n“Aræ” were probably mere rocks lying out at sea, which received their\r\nname from their fancied resemblance to altars. They are mentioned by\r\nVirgil in the Æneid, B. i. l. 113, upon which lines Servius says, that\r\nthey were so called because there the Romans and the people of Africa\r\non one occasion made a treaty.\r\n\r\n[3470] The greater portion of this Chapter is extracted almost\r\nverbatim from the account given by Mela. Ptolemy seems to place the\r\nLiby-Egyptians to the south of the Greater and Lesser Oasis, on the\r\nroute thence to Darfour.\r\n\r\n[3471] Or “White Æthiopians,” men though of dark complexion, not\r\nnegroes. Marcus is of opinion that the words “intervenientibus\r\ndesertis” refer to the tract of desert country lying between the\r\nLeucæthiopians and the Liby-Egyptians, and not to that between the\r\nGætulians on the one hand and the Liby-Egyptians and the Leucæthiopians\r\non the other.\r\n\r\n[3472] Meaning to the south and the south-east of these three nations,\r\naccording to Marcus. Rennel takes the Leucæthiopians to be the present\r\nMandingos of higher Senegambia: Marcus however thinks that they are the\r\nAzanaghis, who dwell on the edge of the Great Desert, and are not of so\r\nblack a complexion as the Mandingos.\r\n\r\n[3473] Probably the people of the present Nigritia or Soudan.\r\n\r\n[3474] Marcus is of opinion that Pliny does not here refer to the\r\nJoliba of Park and other travellers, as other commentators have\r\nsupposed; but that he speaks of the river called Zis by the modern\r\ngeographers, and which Jackson speaks of as flowing from the south-east\r\ntowards north-west. The whole subject of the Niger is however enwrapped\r\nin almost impenetrable obscurity, and as the most recent inquirers have\r\nnot come to any conclusion on the subject, it would be little more than\r\na waste of time and space to enter upon an investigation of the notions\r\nwhich Pliny and Mela entertained on the subject.\r\n\r\n[3475] From γυμνὸς, “naked.”\r\n\r\n[3476] Mentioned in C. 1 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[3477] He refers to the words in the Odyssey, B. i. l. 23, 24.—\r\n\r\n  Αἰθίοπας τοὶ δίχθα δεδαιάται, ἔσχατοι ἄνδρων·\r\n  Οἱ μὲν δυσομένου Ὑπερίονος, οἱ δ’ ἀνιόντος.\r\n\r\n“The Æthiopians, the most remote of mankind, are divided into two\r\nparts, the one at the setting of Hyperion, the other at his rising.”\r\n\r\n[3478] A tribe of Æthiopia, whose position varied considerably at\r\ndifferent epochs of history. Their predatory and savage habits caused\r\nthe most extraordinary reports to be spread of their appearance and\r\nferocity. The more ancient geographers bring them as far westward as\r\nthe region beyond the Libyan Desert, and into the vicinity of the\r\nOases. In the time however of the Antonines, when Ptolemy was composing\r\nhis description of Africa, they appear to the south and east of Egypt,\r\nin the wide and almost unknown tract which lay between the rivers\r\nAstapus and Astobores.\r\n\r\n[3479] Mela speaks of this race as situate farthest to the west. The\r\ndescription of them here given is from Herodotus, B. iv. c. 183-185,\r\nwho speaks of them under the name of “Atarantes.”\r\n\r\n[3480] The people who are visited by no dreams, are called Atlantes by\r\nHerodotus, the same name by which Pliny calls them. He says that their\r\nterritory is ten days’ journey from that of the Atarantes.\r\n\r\n[3481] This also is borrowed from Herodotus. As some confirmation of\r\nthis account, it is worthy of remark, that the Rock Tibboos of the\r\npresent day, who, like the ancient Troglodytæ, dwell in caves, have so\r\npeculiar a kind of speech, that it is compared by the people of Aujelah\r\nto nothing but the whistling of birds. The Troglodytæ of Fezzan are\r\nhere referred to, not those of the coasts of the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n[3482] Mela says that they look upon the Manes or spirits of the\r\ndeparted as their only deities.\r\n\r\n[3483] This is said, in almost the same words, of the Garamantes,\r\nby Herodotus. The mistake was probably made by Mela in copying from\r\nHerodotus, and continued by Pliny when borrowing from him.\r\n\r\n[3484] So called from their supposed resemblance in form to the Satyrs\r\nof the ancient mythology, who were represented as little hairy men with\r\nhorns, long ears, and tails. They were probably monkeys, which had been\r\nmistaken for men.\r\n\r\n[3485] Half goat, half man. See the Note [3254] relative to Ægipan, in C. 1 of\r\nthe present Book, p. 378.\r\n\r\n[3486] Evidently intended to be derived from the Greek ἱμὰς “a thong,”\r\nand πόδες “the feet.” It is most probable that the name of a savage\r\npeople in the interior bore a fancied resemblance to this word, upon\r\nwhich the marvellous story here stated was coined for the purpose\r\nof tallying with the name. From a statement in the Æthiopica of\r\nHeliodorus, B. x., Marcus suggests that the story as to the Blemmyæ\r\nhaving no heads arose from the circumstance, that on the invasion of\r\nthe Persians they were in the habit of falling on one knee and bowing\r\nthe head to the breast, by which means, without injury to themselves,\r\nthey afforded a passage to the horses of the enemy.\r\n\r\n[3487] It must be remembered, as already mentioned, that the ancients\r\nlooked upon Egypt as forming part of Asia, not of Africa. It seems\r\nimpossible to say how this supposition arose, when the Red Sea and the\r\nIsthmus of Suez form so natural and so palpable a frontier between Asia\r\nand Africa.\r\n\r\n[3488] It is not improbable that these numbers are incorrectly stated\r\nin the MSS. of our author.\r\n\r\n[3489] Parisot remarks that Pliny is in error in this statement. A\r\nconsiderable part of Lower Egypt lay both on the right and left of\r\nthe Delta or island formed by the branches of the Nile. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that our author has already included a portion of\r\nwhat was strictly Egypt, in his description of Libya Mareotis.\r\n\r\n[3490] By reason of its triangular form, Δ.\r\n\r\n[3491] The Ombite nome worshipped the crocodile as the emblem of Sebak.\r\nIts capital was Ombos.\r\n\r\n[3492] This nome destroyed the crocodile and worshipped the sun. Its\r\ncapital was Apollinopolis Magna.\r\n\r\n[3493] It worshipped Osiris and his son Orus. The chief town was\r\nThermonthis.\r\n\r\n[3494] Probably the original kingdom of Menes of This, the founder of\r\nthe Egyptian monarchy. It worshipped Osiris. Its capital was This,\r\nafterwards called Abydos.\r\n\r\n[3495] The nome of Thebes, which was its chief town.\r\n\r\n[3496] Its capital was Coptos.\r\n\r\n[3497] Its chief town was Tentyra. This nome worshipped Athor or Venus,\r\nIsis, and Typhon. It destroyed the crocodile.\r\n\r\n[3498] Perhaps the same as the Panopolite or Chemmite nome, which had\r\nfor its chief town Chemmis or Panopolis. It paid divine honours to a\r\ndeified hero.\r\n\r\n[3499] It probably worshipped Typhon. Its capital was Antæopolis.\r\n\r\n[3500] Probably an offshoot from a nome in the Heptanomis of similar\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[3501] Dedicated to the worship of the wolf. Its chief town was\r\nLycopolis. It should be remarked that these names do not appear to be\r\ngiven by Pliny in their proper geographical order.\r\n\r\n[3502] Some of these nomes were inconsiderable and of little\r\nimportance. The Bubastite nome worshipped Bubastis, Artemis, or Diana,\r\nof whom it contained a fine temple.\r\n\r\n[3503] Its chief town was Tanis. In this nome, according to tradition,\r\nMoses was born.\r\n\r\n[3504] Its capital was Athribis, where the shrew-mouse and crocodile\r\nwere worshipped.\r\n\r\n[3505] The seat of the worship of the dog-headed deity Anubis.\r\nIts capital was Cynopolis; which is to be distinguished from the\r\nDeltic city and other places of that name, as this was a nome of the\r\nHeptanomis or Middle Egypt, to which also the Hammonian nome belonged.\r\n\r\n[3506] The border nome of Upper and Middle Egypt.\r\n\r\n[3507] Its capital was Pachnamunis. It worshipped a goddess\r\ncorresponding to the Greek Leto, or the Latona of the Romans.\r\n\r\n[3508] Its capital was Busiris. It worshipped Isis, and at one period\r\nwas said to have sacrificed the nomad tribes of Syria and Arabia.\r\n\r\n[3509] Its chief town was Onuphis.\r\n\r\n[3510] Its chief city was Sais, and it worshipped Neith or Athene, and\r\ncontained the tomb and a sanctuary of Osiris.\r\n\r\n[3511] Its capital was Tava.\r\n\r\n[3512] Its chief town was Naucratis on the coast, the birth-place of\r\nAthenæus, the Deipnosophist. By some authors it is made part of the\r\nSaitic nome. The names given by Pliny vary very considerably from those\r\nfound in others of the ancient writers.\r\n\r\n[3513] The capital of this nome was Heracleopolis, ‘The city of\r\nHercules,’ as Pliny calls it, situate, as he says, on an island, at the\r\nentrance of the nome of Arsinoïtes, formed by the Nile and a canal.\r\nAfter Memphis and Heliopolis, it was probably the most important city\r\nsouth of the Thebaid. Its ruins are inconsiderable; a portion of them\r\nare to be seen at the modern hamlet of Amasieh.\r\n\r\n[3514] He probably means Arsinoë or Arsinoïtis, the chief town of the\r\nnome of that name, and the city so called at the northern extremity\r\nof the Heroöpolite Gulf in the Red Sea. The former is denoted by the\r\nmodern district of El-Fayoom, the most fertile of ancient Egypt. At\r\nthis place the crocodile was worshipped. The Labyrinth and Lake Mœris\r\nwere in this nome. Extensive ruins at Medinet-el-Fayoom, or El-Fares,\r\nrepresent its site. The modern Ardscherud, a village near Suez,\r\ncorresponds to Arsinoë on the Red Sea. There is some little doubt\r\nhowever whether this last Arsinoë is the one here meant by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[3515] Memphis was the chief city of this nome, which was situate\r\nin Middle Egypt, and was the capital of the whole country, and the\r\nresidence of the Pharaohs, who succeeded Psammetichus, B.C. 616. This\r\nnome rose in importance on the decline of the kingdom of Thebais,\r\nbut was afterwards eclipsed by the progress of Alexandria under the\r\nsuccessors of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n[3516] At which Middle Egypt terminates.\r\n\r\n[3517] They are more generally looked upon as forming one nome only,\r\nand included under the name of Hammonium.\r\n\r\n[3518] Its chief town was Heroöpolis, a principal seat of the worship\r\nof Typhon, the evil or destroying genius.\r\n\r\n[3519] The same as the nome of Arsinoïtes, the capital of which,\r\nArsinoë, was originally called Crocodilopolis.\r\n\r\n[3520] Now known as Birket-el-Keroum. This was a vast lake on the\r\nwestern side of the Nile in Middle Egypt, used for the reception and\r\nsubsequent distribution of a part of the overflow of the Nile. The\r\nsupposition that it was formed by artificial means is now pretty\r\ngenerally exploded, and it is regarded as of natural formation. It was\r\nsituate in the nome of Arsinoïtes or Crocodilopolites. Its length seems\r\nto be overstated by our author, as at the present day it is only thirty\r\nmiles in length and five in breadth at the widest part.\r\n\r\n[3521] And it is generally supposed that they are so up to the present\r\nday. The ethnographer Jablonski is of opinion that this river derives\r\nits name from the Coptish word _tneialei_ “to rise at stated times.”\r\nServius, the commentator on Virgil, says that it is derived from the\r\ntwo Greek words νέα ἰλὺς “fresh mud,” in allusion to the fresh mud\r\nor slime which it leaves after each inundation. Singularly enough,\r\nChampollion prefers this silly etymology to that suggested by Jablonski.\r\n\r\n[3522] An interesting disquisition on the probable sources of the Nile,\r\nas viewed by the ancients, is to be found in the Ninth Book of Lucan’s\r\nPharsalia. The Indian word “_nilas_,” “black,” has also been suggested\r\nas its possible origin.\r\n\r\n[3523] What spot is meant under this name, if indeed it is anything\r\nmore than the creation of fancy, it is impossible to ascertain with\r\nany degree of precision. It is possible however that the ancients may\r\nhave had some knowledge of Lake Tchad, and the Mountains of the Moon,\r\nor Djebel-Kumri, though at the same time it is more than doubtful that\r\nthe Nile has its source in either of those localities, the former\r\nespecially.\r\n\r\n[3524] Perhaps a kind of river lamprey. As to the Coracinus, see B.\r\nix. c. 24, 32, and B. xxxii. c. 19, 24, 34, 44, and 53; and as to the\r\nSilurus, B. ix. c. 17, 25, and B. xxxii. c. 31, 36, 40, 43, 44, &c.\r\n\r\n[3525] The modern Vacur in Northern Africa.\r\n\r\n[3526] A district which in reality was at least 1200 or 1500 miles\r\ndistant from any part of the Nile, and probably near 3000 from its real\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n[3527] “Spargit.” It is doubtful whether this word means here “waters,”\r\nor “divides.” Probably however the latter is its meaning.\r\n\r\n[3528] This is the third or eastern branch of the river, now known as\r\nthe Tacazze. It rises in the highlands of Abyssinia, in about 11° 40′\r\nnorth lat. and 39° 40′ east long., and joins the main stream of the\r\nNile, formed by the union of the Abiad and the Azrek, in 17° 45′ north\r\nlat. and about 34° 5′ east long.; the point of junction being the apex\r\nof the island of Meroë, here mentioned by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[3529] Possibly by this name he designates the Bahr-el-Abied, or White\r\nRiver, the main stream of the Nile, the sources of which have not\r\nbeen hitherto satisfactorily ascertained. The Astapus is supposed to\r\nhave been really the name of the Bahr-el-Azrek, or Blue River, the\r\nthird branch of the Nile, the sources of which are in the highlands of\r\nAbyssinia, in about 11° 40′ north lat. and 39° 40′ east long.\r\n\r\n[3530] Or “side of the water that issues from the shades.” As Hardouin\r\nsays, this does not appear to be a very satisfactory explanation.\r\n\r\n[3531] Said by Tzetzes to have been derived from the Greek τρίτος,\r\n“the third,” because it had three times changed its name: having been\r\ncalled, first, the Ocean; secondly, Aëtus, or the Eagle; and thirdly,\r\nÆgyptus.\r\n\r\n[3532] Or the “Cataracts,” for which it is the Greek name. The most\r\nnortherly of these cataracts, called the First Cataract, is, and always\r\nhas been, the southern boundary of Egypt. According to the most recent\r\naccounts, these Cataracts are devoid of any stupendous features, such\r\nas characterize the Falls of Niagara.\r\n\r\n[3533] The one now called the First Cataract.\r\n\r\n[3534] Seven mouths in ancient times, which have now dwindled down to\r\ntwo of any importance, the Damietta mouth on the east, and the Rosetta\r\non the west.\r\n\r\n[3535] The Etesians are periodical winds, which blow steadily from one\r\nquarter for forty days each year, during the season of the Dog-days.\r\nThe opinion here stated was that promulgated by Thales the philosopher.\r\nSeneca refutes it in B. iv. c. 2. of his Quæst. Nat.\r\n\r\n[3536] This was the opinion of Democritus of Abdera, and of\r\nAgatharchidas of Cnidos. It is combated by Diodorus Siculus, B. i., but\r\nit is the opinion most generally received at the present day. See the\r\ndisquisition on the subject introduced in the Ninth book of Lucan’s\r\nPharsalia.\r\n\r\n[3537] And that the high tide or inundation would be consequently\r\ncontinuous as well.\r\n\r\n[3538] The principal well for this purpose was called the “Nilometer,”\r\nor “Gauge for the Nile.”\r\n\r\n[3539] On this subject see Pliny, B. xviii. c. 47, and B. xxxvi. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[3540] Seneca says that the Nile did not rise as usual in the tenth and\r\neleventh years of the reign of Cleopatra, and that the circumstance was\r\nsaid to bode ruin to her and Antony.—Nat. Quæst. B. iv. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[3541] He means dense clouds, productive of rain, not thin mists. See\r\nwhat is said of the Borysthenes by our author, B. xxxi. c. 30.\r\n\r\n[3542] Syene was a city of Upper Egypt, on the eastern bank of the Nile\r\njust below the First Cataract, and was looked upon as the southern\r\nfrontier city of Egypt against Æthiopia. It was an important point in\r\nthe geography and astronomy of the ancients; for, lying just under the\r\ntropic of Cancer, it was chosen as the place through which they drew\r\ntheir chief parallel of latitude. The sun was vertical to Syene at the\r\ntime of the summer solstice, and a well was shown there where the face\r\nof the sun was seen at noon at that time. Its present name is Assouan\r\nor Ossouan.\r\n\r\n[3543] If this word means the “Camp,” it does not appear to be known\r\nwhat camp is meant. Most editions have “Cerastæ,” in which case it\r\nwould mean that at Syene the Cerastes or horned serpent is found.\r\n\r\n[3544] One of these (if indeed Philæ did consist of more than a single\r\nisland, which seems doubtful) is now known as Djeziret-el-Birbe, the\r\n“Island of the Temple.”\r\n\r\n[3545] This island was seated just below the Lesser Cataract, opposite\r\nSyene, and near the western bank of the Nile. At this point the river\r\nbecomes navigable downward to its mouths, and the traveller from\r\nMeroë or Æthiopia enters Egypt Proper. The original name of this\r\nisland was “Ebo,” Eb being in the language of hieroglyphics the symbol\r\nof the elephant and ivory. It was remarkable for its fertility and\r\nverdure, and the Arabs of the present day designate the island as\r\nDjesiret-el-Sag, or “the Blooming.”\r\n\r\n[3546] This is a mistake of Pliny’s, for it was opposite to Syene.\r\nBrotier thinks that Pliny intended to write ‘Philæ,’ but by mistake\r\ninserted Syene.\r\n\r\n[3547] Artemidorus, Juba, and Aristocreon.\r\n\r\n[3548] They were probably made of papyrus, or else of hides, like the\r\nBritish coracles.\r\n\r\n[3549] The last king of the line of Psammetichus, B.C. 569. He\r\nsucceeded Apries, whom the Egyptians put to death. He died just before\r\nthe invasion by Cambyses, having displayed great abilities as a ruler.\r\n\r\n[3550] There was the Greater Apollinopolis, the modern Edfoo, in the\r\nThebaid, on the western bank of the Nile, in lat. 25° north, about\r\nthirteen miles below the lesser Cataract: its inhabitants were enemies\r\nof the crocodile and its worshippers. The remains of two temples there\r\nare considered second only to the temple of Denderah as specimens of\r\nthe sacred structures of Egypt. A Lesser Apollinopolis was in Upper\r\nEgypt, on the western bank of the Nile, in lat. 27° north. Another\r\nLesser Apollinopolis was a town of the Thebaid in the Coptite Nome, in\r\nlat. 26° north, situate between Thebes and Coptos. It was situate at\r\nthe present Kuss.\r\n\r\n[3551] Its site is unknown. Hardouin suggests that it is the Eilethuia\r\nof Ptolemy, the modern El-Kab.\r\n\r\n[3552] “City of Jupiter,” the Greek name for Thebes, the No or No Ammon\r\nof Scripture. It stood in the centre of the Thebaid, on both banks of\r\nthe Nile, above Coptos, and in the Nomos Coptites. Its ruins, which are\r\nthe most magnificent in the world, enclose within their site the four\r\nvillages of Carnac, Luxor, Medinet Abou, and Gournou.\r\n\r\n[3553] Its hieroglyphical name was Kobto, and its site is now occupied\r\nby the modern town of Kouft or Keft. It was situate in lat. 26°\r\nnorth, on the right bank of the Nile, about a mile from its banks.\r\nAs a halting place or rather watering-place for the caravans, it was\r\nenriched by the commerce between Libya and Egypt on the one hand, and\r\nArabia and India and Egypt on the other, the latter being carried\r\non through the port of Berenice on the Red Sea, founded by Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus, B.C. 266. In the seventh century of the Christian era, it\r\nbore for some time the name of Justinianopolis. There are a few remains\r\nof Roman buildings to be seen on its site.\r\n\r\n[3554] Also called Aphrodite or Aphroditopolis. Of this name there\r\nwere several towns or cities in ancient Egypt. In Lower Egypt there\r\nwas Atarbechis, thus named, and a town mentioned by Strabo in the\r\nnome of Leontopolites. In the Heptanomis or Middle Egypt there was\r\nthe place, the ruins of which are called Aftyeh, on the east side of\r\nthe Nile, and the capital of the nome of Aphroditopolites. In Upper\r\nEgypt or the Thebais there was the present Tachta, on the west side of\r\nthe Nile, between Ptolemais and Panopolis, capital of another nome of\r\nAphroditopolites, and that one the ruins of which are now called Deir,\r\non the west bank of the Nile, higher up than the former, and, like it,\r\nsome distance from the river. It was situate in the nome Hermonthites.\r\n\r\n[3555] Another Diospolis. Great Diospolis is mentioned in the preceding\r\npage.\r\n\r\n[3556] Or Tentyra. The modern Dendera of the Arabs, called Dendôri or\r\nHidendôri by the ancient Egyptians.\r\n\r\n[3557] In ancient times called This, and in Coptic Ebôt, the ruins of\r\nwhich are now known as Arábat-el-Matfoon. It was the chief town of the\r\nNomos Thinites, and was situate in lat. 26° 10′ north and long. 32° 3′\r\neast. In the Thebaid it ranked next to Thebes itself. Here according to\r\ngeneral belief was the burial-place of Osiris. In the time of Strabo it\r\nhad sunk into a mere village. Its ruins, though nearly buried in the\r\nsand, are very extensive. There is, however, some uncertainty as to the\r\nexact identity of This with Abydus.\r\n\r\n[3558] The ruins of these places are still to be seen at Abydus.\r\n\r\n[3559] He calls the whole of the country on the western bank of the\r\nNile by this name.\r\n\r\n[3560] Called Absou or Absaï by the Arabs, and Psoë by the ancient\r\nEgyptians. It has been suggested that it was the same place as This,\r\nmore generally identified with Abydus.\r\n\r\n[3561] Its site is now called Ekhmin or Akhmin by the Arabs, Khmim\r\nbeing its ancient Egyptian name. It was the chief town of the nome of\r\nPanopolites, and the deity Phthah was worshipped there under the form\r\nof Priapus.\r\n\r\n[3562] Another Aphroditopolis, the present Tachta, mentioned above, in\r\nNote[3554] in the last page. Pliny distinguishes it from that now called\r\nDeir, mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[3563] Now known as Es-Siout.\r\n\r\n[3564] Or Hermopolis—the modern Esh-moon or Ash-mounion, on the eastern\r\nbank of the Nile, in lat. 27° 54′ north. It was the capital of the\r\nHermopolite nome in the Heptanomis. It was a place of great opulence\r\nand densely populated. The deities Typhon and Thoth were principally\r\nworshipped at this place. The latter, the inventor of the pen and\r\nletters, nearly corresponded with the Hermes of the Greeks (the Mercury\r\nof the Romans), from which the Hellenized name of the place. Its ruins\r\nare very extensive.\r\n\r\n[3565] This town was no doubt connected with the alabaster quarries\r\nof Mount Alabasternus, now Mount St. Anthony, and the hill of\r\nAlabastrites, now the Côteau Hessan.\r\n\r\n[3566] Or Cynopolis, the chief place of the Cynopolite nome. The\r\nDog-headed deity Anubis was worshipped here. The modern Samallus\r\noccupies its site. This place was in the Heptanomis, but there were\r\nseveral other towns of the same name, one of which was situate in the\r\nDelta or Lower Egypt.\r\n\r\n[3567] In C. 9, when speaking of the nome of Heracleopolites; of which\r\nnome, this place, called Heracleopolis, was the capital. It was situate\r\nat the entrance of the valley of the Fayoum, on an island formed by\r\nthe Nile and a canal. After Memphis and Heliopolis it was probably the\r\nmost important city north of the Thebaid. It furnished two dynasties of\r\nkings to Egypt. The ichneumon was worshipped here, from which it may be\r\ninferred that the people were hostile to the crocodile. Its ruins are\r\ninconsiderable; the village of Anasieh covers part of them.\r\n\r\n[3568] The capital of the nome of Arsinoïtes, seated on the western\r\nbank of the Nile, between the river and Lake Mœris, south-west of\r\nMemphis, in lat. 29° north. It was called under the Pharaohs, “the City\r\nof Crocodiles,” from the reverence paid by the people to that animal.\r\nIts ruins are to be seen at Medinet-el-Fayoom or El-Fares.\r\n\r\n[3569] Its magnificent ruins, known by the name of Menf and Metrabenny,\r\nare to be seen about ten miles above the pyramids of Gizeh.\r\n\r\n[3570] This lay beyond Lake Mœris, or Birket-el-Keroun, at a short\r\ndistance from the city of Arsinoë. It had 3000 apartments, 1500 of\r\nwhich were underground. The accounts given by modern travellers of its\r\nsupposed ruins do not agree with what we have learned from the ancients\r\nrespecting its architecture and site. The purposes for which it was\r\nbuilt are unknown. Its supposed site is called Havara.\r\n\r\n[3571] If this is not an abbreviation or corruption for Crocodilon, as\r\nHardouin suggests, it may probably mean the “town of Rams,” from the\r\nworship perhaps of that animal there.\r\n\r\n[3572] Heliopolis or Rameses. In Scripture it is called by the names of\r\nOn and No—Gen. xli. 45 and Ezek. xxx. 15. It stood on the eastern side\r\nof the Pelusiac arm of the Nile, near the right bank of the Great Canal\r\nwhich connected the river with the Red Sea, and close adjoining to\r\nthe present overland route for travellers to India. It was one of the\r\nmost ancient of the Egyptian cities; here the father-in-law of Joseph\r\nexercised the office of high-priest, and here the prophet Jeremiah is\r\nsupposed to have written his Book of Lamentations. Its priests were the\r\ngreat depositaries of the theological and historical learning of Egypt.\r\nSolon, Thales, and Plato were reputed each to have visited its schools.\r\nAccording to Macrobius, Baalbec, the Syrian City of the Sun, was a\r\ncolony from this place. It was the capital of the nome Heliopolites,\r\nand paid worship to the sun and the bull Mnevis, the rival of Apis.\r\nFrom Josephus we learn that after the dispersion and fall of the tribes\r\nof Judah and Israel, great numbers of the Jews took refuge at this\r\nplace, forming almost one-half of its population. The ruins, which\r\nwere extremely magnificent, occupied in the twelfth century an area\r\nnearly three miles in extent. Pliny speaks of the great obelisk there,\r\nwhich is still standing. (See B. xxxvi. c. 9.) The village of Matarieh\r\noccupies a part of its site, and besides the obelisk of red granite,\r\nthere are a few remains of the Temple of the Sun.\r\n\r\n[3573] Now called Birk-el-Mariout.\r\n\r\n[3574] Or Dinocrates. He was the architect of the new temple of Diana\r\nat Ephesus, which was built after the destruction of the former one\r\nby Herostratus. It was this architect who formed a design for cutting\r\nMount Athos into a statue of Alexander, with a city in the right hand\r\nand a reservoir of the mountain streams in the left.\r\n\r\n[3575] Holland seems to think that the word “laxitate” applies to\r\nchlamys.\r\n\r\n[3576] The _chlamys_ was a scarf or cloak worn over the shoulders, and\r\nespecially used by military persons of high rank. It did not reach\r\nlower than the knees, and was open in front, covering only the neck,\r\nback, and shoulders.\r\n\r\n[3577] Its real dimensions were something less than 300 stadia, or\r\nthirty geographical miles long, and rather more than 150 stadia wide.\r\n\r\n[3578] Or “Pseudostomata.” These were crossed in small boats, as they\r\nwere not navigable for ships of burden.\r\n\r\n[3579] In the Pharaonic times Canopus was the capital of the nome of\r\nMenelaïtes, and the principal harbour of the Delta. It probably owed\r\nits name to the god Canobus, a pitcher full of holes, with a human\r\nhead, which was worshipped here with peculiar pomp. It was remarkable\r\nfor the number of its festivals and the general dissoluteness of its\r\nmorals. Traces of its ruins are to be seen about three miles from the\r\nmodern Aboukir.\r\n\r\n[3580] Corresponding to the modern Raschid or Rosetta. It is supposed\r\nthat this place was noted for its manufactory of chariots.\r\n\r\n[3581] The town of Sebennys or Sebennytum, now Samannoud, gave name to\r\none of the nomes, and the Sebennytic Mouth of the Nile.\r\n\r\n[3582] Or the Pathinetic or Bucolic Mouth, said to be the same as the\r\nmodern Damietta Mouth.\r\n\r\n[3583] The capital of the Mendesian nome, called by the Arabs Ochmoun.\r\nThis mouth is now known as the Deibeh Mouth.\r\n\r\n[3584] Now called Szan or Tzan. The Tanitic Mouth, which is sometimes\r\ncalled the Saitic, is at the present day called Omm-Faredjé.\r\n\r\n[3585] Its ruins are to be seen at the modern Tineh. This city in early\r\ntimes had the name of Abaris. It was situate on the eastern side of\r\nthe most easterly mouth of the Nile, which, after it, was called the\r\nPelusiac Mouth, about two miles from the sea, in the midst of morasses.\r\nBeing the frontier city towards Syria and Arabia it was strongly\r\nfortified. It was the birth-place of Ptolemy the geographer.\r\n\r\n[3586] Butos or Buto stood on the Sebennytic arm of the Nile near its\r\nmouth, on the southern shores of the Butic Lake. It was the chief seat\r\nof the worship of the goddess Buto, whom the Greeks identified with\r\nLeto or Latona. The modern Kem Kasir occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[3587] Called Harbait by the Arabs, and Farbait by the ancient\r\nEgyptians.\r\n\r\n[3588] In the Delta. It was the capital of the nome of Leontopolites,\r\nand probably of late foundation, as no writer previous to Pliny\r\nmentions it. Its site is uncertain, but Thall-Essabouah, the “Hill of\r\nthe Lion,” has been suggested.\r\n\r\n[3589] The chief town of the Athribitic nome in Lower Egypt. It\r\nstood on the eastern bank of the Tanitic branch of the Nile. This\r\nnome and town derived their name from the goddess Thriphis, whom the\r\ninscriptions there and at Panopolis designate as the “most great\r\ngoddess.” The ruins at Atrieb or Trieb, at the spot where the modern\r\ncanal of Moueys turns off from the Nile, represent the ancient\r\nAthribis. They are very extensive, and among them are considerable\r\nremains of the Roman era.\r\n\r\n[3590] This was situate near the city or town of Busiris in the Delta.\r\nThe modern village of Bahbeyt is supposed to cover the ruins of the\r\ntemple of Isis.\r\n\r\n[3591] The modern Busyr or Abousir, where considerable ruins of the\r\nancient city are still to be seen. It was the chief town of the nome of\r\nBusirites, and stood south of Sais, near the Phatnitic mouth, on the\r\nwestern bank of the Nile. This was also the name of a town in Middle\r\nEgypt, in the neighbourhood of Memphis, and represented by another\r\nvillage of the name of Abousir. Pliny, B. xxxvi. c. 16, speaks of the\r\nCatacombs in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[3592] The place of that name in the Delta is here meant.\r\n\r\n[3593] Probably the town of that name, otherwise called Aphroditopolis,\r\nin the nome of Leontopolites.\r\n\r\n[3594] The ruins of which are now called Sa-el-Hajjar. It was situate\r\nin the Delta, on the east side of the Canopic branch of the Nile. It\r\nwas the ancient capital of Lower Egypt and contained the palace and\r\nburial-place of the Pharaohs. It was the chief seat of the worship of\r\nthe Egyptian goddess Neith, also known as Sais. It gave its name to the\r\nnome of Saïtes.\r\n\r\n[3595] It was situate in the Delta of Egypt and in the nome of Saïtes,\r\non the eastern bank of the Canopic branch of the Nile. It was a colony\r\nof the Milesians, founded probably in the reign of Amasis, about B.C.\r\n550, and remained a pure Greek city. It was the only place in Egypt in\r\nwhich, in the time of the later Pharaohs, foreigners were permitted\r\nto settle and trade. In later times it was famous for the worship of\r\nAphrodite or Venus, and rivalled Canopus in the dissoluteness of its\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\n[3596] Ptolemy the geographer does this.\r\n\r\n[3597] Arabia Petræa; that part of Arabia which immediately joins up to\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n[3598] Called Arabia Felix to the present day.\r\n\r\n[3599] The part of Arabia which joins up to Egypt, Arabia Petræa namely.\r\n\r\n[3600] Strabo places this people as far south as the mouth of the Red\r\nSea, _i. e._ on the east of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. Forster (in\r\nhis ‘Arabia,’ vol. ii.) takes this name to be merely an inversion of\r\nBeni Kahtan, the great tribe which mainly peoples, at the present day,\r\ncentral and southern Arabia.\r\n\r\n[3601] Probably the people of Esebon, the Heshbon of Scripture, spoken\r\nof by Jerome as being the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites.\r\n\r\n[3602] The “tent-people,” from the Greek σκηνὴ, “a tent.” This seems\r\nto have been a name common to the nomadic tribes of Arabia. Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus speaks of them as being the same as the Saraceni or\r\nSaracens.\r\n\r\n[3603] The modern El Katieh or El Kas; which is the summit of a lofty\r\nrange of sandstone hills on the borders of Egypt and Arabia Petræa,\r\nimmediately south of the Sirbonian Lake and the Mediterranean Sea. On\r\nits western side was the tomb of Pompey the Great.\r\n\r\n[3604] The same as the Amalekites of Scripture, according to Hardouin.\r\nBochart thinks that they are the same as the Chavilæi, who are\r\nmentioned as dwelling in the vicinity of Babylon.\r\n\r\n[3605] The position which Pliny assigns to this nation would correspond\r\nwith the northern part of the modern district of the Hedjaz. Forster\r\nidentifies them with the Cauraitæ, or Cadraitæ of Arrian, and the Darræ\r\nof Ptolemy, tracing their origin to the Cedar or Kedar, the son of\r\nIshmael, mentioned in Genesis xxv. 13, and represented by the modern\r\nHarb nation and the modern town of Kedeyre. See Psalm cxx. 5: “Woe is\r\nme, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!”\r\n\r\n[3606] An Arabian people, said to have descended from the eldest son\r\nof Ishmael, who had their original abodes in the north-western part\r\nof the Arabian peninsula, east and south-east of the Moabites and\r\nEdomites. Extending their territory, we find the Nabatæi of Greek and\r\nRoman history occupying nearly the whole of Arabia Petræa, along the\r\nnorth-east coast of the Red Sea, on both sides of the Ælanitic Gulf,\r\nand on the Idumæan mountains, where they had their capital, Petra, hewn\r\nout of the rock.\r\n\r\n[3607] Now the Bahr-el-Soueys, or Gulf of Suez.\r\n\r\n[3608] The Bahr-el-Akabah, or Gulf of Akabah.\r\n\r\n[3609] Now Akabah, an Idumæan town of Arabia Petræa, situate at the\r\nhead of the eastern gulf of the Red Sea, which was called after this\r\ntown “Ælaniticus Sinus.” It was annexed to the kingdom of Judah, with\r\nthe other cities of Idumæa, by David, 2 Sam. viii. 14, and was one of\r\nthe harbours on the Red Sea from which the ships of Solomon sailed for\r\nOphir. See 1 Kings ix. 26 and 2 Chron. viii. 17. It was a place of\r\ncommercial importance under the Romans and the head-quarters of the\r\nTenth Legion. A fortress now occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[3610] Its site is now known as Guzzah. It was the last city on the\r\nsouth-west frontier of Palestine, and from the earliest times was a\r\nstrongly fortified place. It was taken from the Philistines by the Jews\r\nmore than once, but as often retaken. It was also taken by Cyrus the\r\nGreat and Alexander, and afterwards by Ptolemy Lagus, who destroyed it.\r\nIt afterwards recovered, and was again destroyed by Alexander Jannæus,\r\nB.C. 96, after which, it was rebuilt by Gabinius and ultimately united\r\nto the Roman province of Syria. In A.D. 65 it was again destroyed, but\r\nwas rebuilt, and finally fell into the hands of the Arabs, in A.D. 634.\r\n\r\n[3611] Meaning the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[3612] The present Suez. See B. vi. c. 33.\r\n\r\n[3613] Or the “Hollow” Syria. This was properly the name given, after\r\nthe Macedonian conquest, to the great valley between the two great\r\nranges of Mount Lebanon, in the south of Syria, bordering upon Phœnicia\r\non the west, and Palestine on the south. In the wars between the\r\nPtolemies and the Seleucidæ, the name was applied to the whole of the\r\nsouthern portion of Syria, which became subject for some time to the\r\nkings of Egypt; but under the Romans, it was confined to Cœlesyria\r\nproper with the district east of Anti-Libanus, about Damascus, and a\r\nportion of Palestine east of Jordan.\r\n\r\n[3614] Or Ostracine, the northern point of Arabia.\r\n\r\n[3615] This was a great fortress of Syria founded by Seleucus B.C. 300,\r\nat the foot of Mount Pieria and overhanging the Mediterranean, four\r\nmiles north of the Orontes and twelve miles west of Antioch. It had\r\nfallen entirely to decay in the sixth century of our era. There are\r\nconsiderable ruins of its harbour and mole, its walls and necropolis.\r\nThey bear the name of Seleukeh or Kepse.\r\n\r\n[3616] From the Greek ζεῦγμα, “a junction;” built by Seleucus Nicator\r\non the borders of Commagene and Cyrrhestice, on the west bank of the\r\nEuphrates, where the river had been crossed by a bridge of boats\r\nconstructed by Alexander the Great. The modern Rumkaleh is supposed to\r\noccupy its site.\r\n\r\n[3617] On this subject see B. vii. c. 57. The invention of letters and\r\nthe first cultivation of the science of astronomy have been claimed for\r\nthe Egyptians and other nations. The Tyrians were probably the first\r\nwho applied the science of astronomy to the purposes of navigation.\r\nThere is little doubt that warfare must have been studied as an art\r\nlong before the existence of the Phœnician nation.\r\n\r\n[3618] Strabo places this between Mount Casius and Pelusium.\r\n\r\n[3619] See C. 12 of the present Book. Chabrias the Athenian aided\r\nNectanebus II. against his revolted subjects.\r\n\r\n[3620] Its ruins are to be seen on the present Ras Straki.\r\n\r\n[3621] Now called the Sabakat Bardowal. It lay on the coast of Egypt,\r\neast of Mount Casius, and it is not improbable that the boundary-line\r\nbetween Egypt and Palæstina or Idumæa ran through the middle of its\r\nwaters. It was strongly impregnated with asphaltus. A connection\r\nformerly existed between it and the Mediterranean, but this being\r\nstopped up, it gradually grew smaller by evaporation and is now nearly\r\ndry.\r\n\r\n[3622] The present Kulat-el-Arich or El Arish, situate at the mouth\r\nof the brook El-Arish, called by the Scriptures the “river of Egypt.”\r\nIts name signifies in Greek, “cutting off of noses,” and is probably\r\nderived from the fact of its having been the place of exile for\r\ncriminals who had been so mutilated, under the Æthiopian kings of\r\nEgypt. Poinsinet suggests however that the name means the “town of the\r\ncircumcised.”\r\n\r\n[3623] The place on its site is still called Refah, but it was really\r\nsituate on the coast. Gaza has been already mentioned in a Note [3610]\r\nto C. 12, p. 423.\r\n\r\n[3624] Anthedon was on the coast of Palestine, although Pliny says to\r\nthe contrary. It was situate about three miles to the south-west of\r\nGaza, and was destroyed by Alexander Jannæus. In the time of Julian it\r\nwas addicted to the worship of Astarte, the Syrian Venus. According to\r\nDupinet the present name of its site is Daron.\r\n\r\n[3625] Brotier says that this is the same as the Mount Gerizim of\r\nScripture, but that was situate in Samaria, a considerable distance\r\nfrom the southern coast of Palæstina. Pliny is the only author that\r\nmentions it.\r\n\r\n[3626] The Ascalon of Scripture, one of the five cities of the\r\nPhilistines, situate on the coast of the Mediterranean, between Gaza\r\nand Jamnia. In early times it was the seat of the worship of Derceto,\r\na fish with a woman’s head. The ruins, which still bear the name of\r\nAskulân, are very extensive, and indicative of great strength. The\r\nshalot or scallion was originally a native of this place, and thence\r\nderived its name.\r\n\r\n[3627] The Ashdod of Scripture. It was one of the five cities of the\r\nPhilistines and the chief seat of the worship of Dagon. Herodotus\r\nstates that it stood a siege of twenty-nine years from Psammetichus,\r\nking of Egypt. It was afterwards taken and retaken several times. It\r\nwas situate between Ascalon and Jamnia, and its site is indicated by\r\nthe modern village of Esdad, but no ruins of the ancient city are\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\n[3628] One of these was a city of the Philistines, assigned to the\r\ntribe of Judah in the fifteenth Chapter of Joshua, 45, according to the\r\nSeptuagint version, but omitted in the Hebrew, which only mentions it\r\nin 2 Chron. xxvi. 6 (where it is called Jabneh in the English version),\r\nas one of the cities of the Philistines taken and destroyed by King\r\nUzziah. The place of this name that lay in the interior, is probably\r\nthe one spoken of by Josephus as in that part of the tribe of Judah\r\noccupied by the children of Dan, as also in the 1 Maccabees, x. 69-71.\r\nThe one was probably the port of the other. The ruins of the port still\r\nretain the name of Yebora, and are situate on an eminence about an\r\nhour’s distance from the sea, on the banks of the river Rûbin.\r\n\r\n[3629] Or Joppa of Scripture, now called Yâfa or Jaffa. The timber\r\nfrom Lebanon intended for both the first and second Temples was landed\r\nhere. It was taken and retaken more than once during the wars of the\r\nMaccabees, and was finally annexed by Pompey to the Roman province of\r\nSyria. It is mentioned several times in the New Testament in connection\r\nwith Saint Peter. In the Jewish war, having become a refuge for\r\npirates, it was taken by Cestius and destroyed, and even the very ruins\r\nwere demolished by Vespasian. It was afterwards rebuilt, and in the\r\ntime of the Crusades was alternately in the hands of the Christians and\r\nthe Moslems.\r\n\r\n[3630] To be devoured by the sea monster, from which she was delivered\r\nby Perseus, who had borrowed for the occasion the _talaria_ or winged\r\nshoes of Mercury. In B. ix. c. 4, Pliny states that the skeleton of the\r\nmonster was exhibited at Rome by M. Æmilius Scaurus, when he was Curule\r\nÆdile.\r\n\r\n[3631] Probably the same as Derceto or Atargatis, the fish-goddess with\r\na woman’s head, of the Syrians.\r\n\r\n[3632] Situate between Cæsarea and Joppa. It is probable that it owed\r\nits name to the Macedonian kings of either Egypt or Syria. Arsûf, a\r\ndeserted village, but which itself was of considerable importance in\r\nthe time of the Crusades, represents the ancient Apollonia.\r\n\r\n[3633] The site of the Turris Stratonis was afterwards occupied by\r\nCæsarea, a city on the coast, founded by Herod the Great, and named\r\nCæsarea in honour of Augustus Cæsar. It was renowned for the extent\r\nand magnificence of its harbour, which was secured by a breakwater of\r\nstupendous construction. For some time it was considered the principal\r\ncity of Palestine and the chief seat of the Roman government. Although\r\nit again changed its name, as Pliny states, it still retained its name\r\nof Cæsarea as the Metropolitan See of the First Palestine. It was also\r\nof considerable importance during the occupation of the Holy Land by\r\nthe Crusaders. Its ruins are still visible, but have served as a quarry\r\nfor many generations, and Jaffa, Sidon, Acre and Beyrout have been\r\nsupplied with stones from this site. Massive remains of its mole or\r\nbreakwater and its towers still exist.\r\n\r\n[3634] Or Phœnicia.\r\n\r\n[3635] By some regarded as the Scriptural town of Sichem, but by others\r\nas a distinct place, though in its immediate vicinity. Its present\r\nname is Naplous or Nabolos, situate between Mounts Ebal and Gerizim.\r\nIts proper name under the Romans was Flavia Neapolis. It was the\r\nbirth-place of Justin Martyr.\r\n\r\n[3636] The city of Samaria, so called from Shemer, the owner of the\r\nhill which Omri, King of Israel, purchased, about B.C. 922, for its\r\nsite. Herod greatly renovated this city, which he called Sebaste, in\r\nhonour of his patron Augustus, in Greek “Sebastos.” Its site is now\r\noccupied by a poor village, which bears the name of Sebustieh.\r\n\r\n[3637] A town of Palæstina, frequently mentioned by Josephus as\r\nremarkable for the strength of its fortifications, and situate on the\r\nLake Tiberias, opposite to Tarichæa. After a spirited defence, it was\r\ntaken by Vespasian, who slaughtered 4000 of the survivors, upon which\r\n5000 threw themselves from the walls, and were dashed to pieces below.\r\nThe site had been forgotten for nearly eighteen centuries, when Lord\r\nLindsay discovered it on a lofty hill on the east of Lake Tiberias, and\r\nnearly opposite the town of that name. It is now called El-Hossn, and\r\nthe ruins of the fortifications are very extensive.\r\n\r\n[3638] Antiochian Syria.\r\n\r\n[3639] Peræa was the general name of that part of Palæstina which lay\r\neast of the river Jordan; but more usually, in a restricted sense, it\r\nsignified a part only of that region, namely the district between the\r\nrivers Hieromax on the north, and Arnon on the south.\r\n\r\n[3640] Jericho, so often mentioned in Scripture. It was celebrated for\r\nits palm-grove, which was presented by Antony to Cleopatra. A Bedouin\r\nencampment called Riha is all that now occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[3641] A city eight or ten miles from the village Emmaüs of the New\r\nTestament. It was called Nicopolis, in commemoration, it has been\r\nsuggested, of the destruction of Jerusalem. Its site is still marked by\r\na village called Ammious, on the road from Jerusalem to Jaffa.\r\n\r\n[3642] So often mentioned in the New Testament. This town lay to the\r\nS.E. of Joppa, and N.W. of Jerusalem, at the junction of several roads\r\nwhich lead from the sea-coast. It was destroyed by the Romans in the\r\nJewish war, but was soon after rebuilt, and called Diospolis. A village\r\ncalled Lud occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[3643] So called from Acrabbim, its chief town, situate nine miles from\r\nNicopolis. The toparchy of Acrabbim, which formerly formed part of\r\nSamaria, was the most northerly of those of Judæa.\r\n\r\n[3644] Situate in the country of Benjamin. Josephus reckons it second\r\nin importance only to Jerusalem, from which, according to Eusebius,\r\nit was distant fifteen miles, on the road to the modern Nablous. That\r\nauthor also identifies it with the Eshcol of Scripture. Its site is\r\nmarked by a small Christian village, called by the natives Jufna.\r\n\r\n[3645] Like the two preceding ones, this toparchy for a long time\r\nbelonged to Samaria. Thamna, or Thamnis, was the Timnath-Serah in Mount\r\nEphraim, mentioned in Joshua xix. 50, and xxiv. 30, as the place where\r\nJoshua was buried.\r\n\r\n[3646] The toparchy of Bethleptepha of other authors. It appears to\r\nhave been situate in the south of Judæa, and in that part which is by\r\nJosephus commonly called Idumæa. Reland has remarked, that the name\r\nresembles Beth-lebaoth, a city of the tribe of Simeon, mentioned in\r\nJoshua xix. 6.\r\n\r\n[3647] From the Greek, meaning the “mountain district,” or the “hill\r\ncountry,” as mentioned in Luke i. 39.\r\n\r\n[3648] Or “Sacred Solyma.”\r\n\r\n[3649] A fortress of Palæstina, erected by Herod the Great, at a\r\ndistance of about sixty stadia from Jerusalem, and not far from Tekoa.\r\nIts site has been identified by modern travellers with El-Furedis,\r\nor the Paradise; probably the same as the spot called the “Frank\r\nMountain,” on the top of which the ruined walls of the fortress are\r\nstill to be seen.\r\n\r\n[3650] Called by the Arabs Bahr-el-Arden.\r\n\r\n[3651] Situate on Mount Panias, or Paneas, on the range of Anti-Libanus.\r\n\r\n[3652] In C. 16 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[3653] On the contrary, as Parisot observes, the Jordan runs in a\r\nstraight line almost into the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\n[3654] The Lake of Sodom, or the Dead Sea, in which the Cities of the\r\nPlain were swallowed up.\r\n\r\n[3655] In Scripture also called the Lake Tiberias, and the Sea of\r\nGennesareth, or Chinnereth. It is now called the Sea of Tabariah, or\r\nTabarieh.\r\n\r\n[3656] The one of the two Bethsaidas, which was situate on the north\r\nof the Sea of Tiberias. It was enlarged by Philip the Tetrarch, who\r\ngreatly beautified it, and changed its name to Julias, in honour of the\r\ndaughter of Augustus, the wife of Tiberius. It is generally supposed by\r\nthe learned world, that this was not the Bethsaida mentioned so often\r\nin the New Testament. Its ruins are probably those now seen on a hill\r\ncalled Et-Tell, on the north-western extremity of the lake.\r\n\r\n[3657] On the east of the lake. From it the district of Hippene took\r\nits name.\r\n\r\n[3658] Its ruins are to be seen at El-Kereh, on the south side of the\r\nlake. It was strongly fortified, and made a vigorous resistance against\r\nthe Romans in the Jewish War. It received its name from the great\r\nquantities of fish which were salted there, τάριχοι.\r\n\r\n[3659] Now Tabariah, or Tabarieh, a miserable village. It was built by\r\nHerod Antipas, in honour of the Emperor Tiberius. After the destruction\r\nof Jerusalem, it became the seat of the Jewish Sanhedrin.\r\n\r\n[3660] These hot springs are by Josephus called Emmaüs, probably a form\r\nof the Hebrew name Hammath. Dr. Robinson, in his Biblical Researches,\r\nidentifies this with the town of Hammath, of the tribe of Naphthali,\r\nmentioned in Joshua xix. 35.\r\n\r\n[3661] From the Greek ἄσφαλτος.\r\n\r\n[3662] This is an exaggeration, though it is the fact that many heavy\r\nsubstances, which in ordinary water would sink immediately, will float\r\non the surface of this lake. It has been suggested, that the story\r\nhere mentioned arose from the circumstance of the name of ‘bulls,’ or\r\n‘cows,’ having been applied by the ancient Nabatæi to the large masses\r\nof asphaltum which floated on its surface.\r\n\r\n[3663] The country of the Arabian Scenitæ, or “tent people.”\r\n\r\n[3664] It lay on the east of the Dead Sea, and not the south, as here\r\nmentioned by Pliny, being a border fortress in the south of Peræa, and\r\non the confines of the Nabatæi. There was a tradition that it was at\r\nthis place that John the Baptist was beheaded. The city now bears the\r\nname of Mascra.\r\n\r\n[3665] A Greek name, signifying the “Fine Stream.” These were warm\r\nsprings, situate on the eastern side of Jordan, to which Herod\r\nthe Great resorted during his last illness, by the advice of his\r\nphysicians. The valley of Callirhoë was visited by Captains Irby and\r\nMangles in 1818, and an interesting account of it is to be found in\r\ntheir ‘Travels,’ pp. 467-469. The waters are sulphureous to the taste.\r\n\r\n[3666] The Essenes, or Hessenes. These properly formed one of the\r\ngreat sects into which the Jews were divided in the time of Christ.\r\nThey are not mentioned by name in the New Testament, but it has been\r\nconjectured that they are alluded to in Matt. xix. 12, and Col. ii.\r\n18, 23. As stated here by Pliny, they generally lived at a distance\r\nfrom large towns, in communities which bore a great resemblance to the\r\nmonkish societies of later times. They sent gifts to the Temple at\r\nJerusalem, but never offered sacrifices there. They were divided into\r\nfour classes, according to the time of their initiation. Their origin\r\nis uncertain. Some writers look upon them as the same as the Assidians,\r\nor Chasidim, mentioned in 1 Maccabees, ii. 42, vii. 13. Their principal\r\nsociety was probably the one mentioned by Pliny, and from this other\r\nsmaller ones proceeded, and spread over Palestine, Syria, and Egypt.\r\nThe Essenes of Egypt were divided into two sects; the _practical_\r\nEssenes, whose mode of life was the same as those of Palestine; and\r\nthe _contemplative_ Essenes, who were called _Therapeutæ_. Both sects\r\nmaintained the same doctrines; but the latter were distinguished by a\r\nmore rigid mode of life. It has been suggested by Taylor, the editor of\r\n‘Calmet’s Dictionary of the Bible,’ that John the Baptist belonged to\r\nthis sect.\r\n\r\n[3667] Or Engedi. Its ancient name was Hazezon-Tamar, when it was\r\ninhabited by the Amorites. See Gen. xiv. 7; 2 Chron. xx. 2. According\r\nto Josephus, it gave name to one of the fifteen toparchies of Judæa. It\r\nstill retains its name, Ain-Jedey, or “Fountain of the Goats,” and was\r\nso called from a spring which issued out of the limestone rock at the\r\nbase of a lofty cliff.\r\n\r\n[3668] Its site is now known as Sebbeh, on the south-west of the Dead\r\nSea.\r\n\r\n[3669] Δεκὰ πολεῖς, the “Ten Cities.” He alludes to the circumstance,\r\nthat the number of cities varied from time to time in this district;\r\none being destroyed in warfare, and others suddenly rising from its\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n[3670] The capital city of Syria, both in ancient and modern times.\r\nIt is now called Es-Sham. The only epithet given to it by the ancient\r\npoets is that of “ventosa,” or “windy,” found in the Pharsalia of\r\nLucan, B. iii. l. 215, which, it has been remarked, is anything but\r\nappropriately chosen.\r\n\r\n[3671] Or the “Golden River.” It is uncertain whether this was the\r\nAbana or Pharpar, mentioned in 2 Kings v. 12. Strabo remarks, that the\r\nwaters of the Chrysorroös “are almost entirely consumed in irrigation,\r\nas it waters a large extent of deep soil.”\r\n\r\n[3672] The ancient Rabbath Ammon, a city of the Ammonites. It was\r\nafterwards called Astarte, and then Philadelphia, in honour of Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus. According to D’Anville, the present name of its site is\r\nAmman.\r\n\r\n[3673] Thirty-three miles from Apamea. Its ruins are probably those\r\nmentioned by Abulfeda under the name of Rafaniat. William of Tyre says,\r\nthat it was taken in the year 1125 by the Count of Tripoli.\r\n\r\n[3674] Previously called Beth-shan. It was the next city of the\r\nDecapolis in magnitude after Damascus. It was situate in the land of\r\nthe tribe of Issachar, though it belonged to the Manasites. At this\r\nplace the bodies of Saul and his sons were hung up by the Philistines;\r\nsee 1 Sam. xxxi. 10-12. Reland suggests that it received the name of\r\nScythopolis, not from a Scythian colony, but from the Succoth of Gen.\r\nxxxiii. 17, which appears to have been in its vicinity. Its ruins,\r\nwhich still bear the name of Baisan, are very extensive.\r\n\r\n[3675] Called by Josephus the capital of Peræa, and the chief place of\r\nthe district of the Gadarenes of the Evangelists. Its ruins, about six\r\nmiles south-east of the Sea of Galilee, are very extensive.\r\n\r\n[3676] Still called the Yarmak, evidently from its ancient name. Hippo\r\nhas been mentioned in the last Chapter.\r\n\r\n[3677] Or Dium, between Pella and Gadara. In later times, this place\r\nwas included in Roman Arabia.\r\n\r\n[3678] Also called Butis. It was the most southerly of the ten cities\r\nwhich comprised the Decapolis, standing about five miles south of\r\nScythopolis, or Beth-shan. Its exact site seems not to have been\r\nascertained; but it has been suggested that it is the modern El-Bujeh.\r\nFrom the expression used by Pliny, it would appear to have had mineral\r\nwaters in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[3679] Of this place nothing is known; but it is most probable that\r\nthe _Gerasa_ of Ptolemy and Josephus is meant. According to the former\r\nwriter, it was thirty-five miles from Pella. Its site is marked by\r\nextensive ruins, thirty-five miles east of the Jordan, known by the\r\nname of Gerash, and on the borders of the Great Desert of the Hauvan.\r\nAccording to Dr. Keith, the ruins bear extensive marks of splendour.\r\n\r\n[3680] Ptolemy mentions a city of this name in Cœlesyria.\r\n\r\n[3681] So called from having been originally groups of four\r\nprincipalities, held by princes who were vassals to the Roman emperors,\r\nor the kings of Syria.\r\n\r\n[3682] Containing the northern district of Palestine, beyond the\r\nJordan, between Antilibanus and the mountains of Arabia. It was bounded\r\non the north by the territory of Damascus, on the east by Auranitis, on\r\nthe south by Ituræa, and on the west by Gaulanitis. It was so called\r\nfrom its ranges of rocky mountains, or τραχῶνες, the caves in which\r\ngave refuge to numerous bands of robbers.\r\n\r\n[3683] So called from the mountain of that name. Cæsarea Philippi also\r\nbore the name of Panias. It was situate at the south of Mount Hermon,\r\non the Jordan, just below its source. It was built by Philip the\r\nTetrarch, B.C. 3. King Agrippa called it Neronias; but it soon lost\r\nthat name.\r\n\r\n[3684] In C. xiv. of the present Book, as that in which the Jordan\r\ntakes its rise.\r\n\r\n[3685] A place of great strength in Cœle-Syria, now known as Nebi Abel,\r\nsituate between Heliopolis and Damascus.\r\n\r\n[3686] Situate between Tripolis and Antaradus, at the north-west foot\r\nof Mount Libanus. It lay within a short distance of the sea, and\r\nwas famous for the worship paid by its inhabitants to Astarte, the\r\nSyrian Aphrodite. A temple was erected here to Alexander the Great,\r\nin which Alexander Severus, the Roman Emperor, was born, his parents\r\nhaving resorted thither to celebrate a festival, A.D. 205. From this\r\ncircumstance, its name was changed to Cæsarea. Burckhardt fixes its\r\nsite at a hill called Tel-Arka.\r\n\r\n[3687] Of this place, which probably took its name from its numerous\r\nvines, nothing whatever is known.\r\n\r\n[3688] Called by Pliny, in B. xii. c. 41, Gabba. It was situate at the\r\nfoot of Mount Carmel between Cæsarea and Ptolemais, sixteen miles from\r\nthe former. No remains of it are to be seen. It must not be confounded\r\nwith Gabala, in Galilee, fortified by Herod the Great.\r\n\r\n[3689] The town was situate between Cæsarea and Ptolemais. The river\r\nhas been identified with the modern Nahi-el-Zerka, in which, according\r\nto Pococke, crocodiles have been found.\r\n\r\n[3690] Called Dor, before the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites.\r\nSee Joshua xvii. 11, and Judges i. 27. It afterwards belonged to the\r\nhalf-tribe of Manasseh. Its site is now called Tortura.\r\n\r\n[3691] Its site is now called Atlik, according to D’Anville. Parisot\r\nsuggests that it is the modern Keufah; others that it is Hepha, near\r\nMount Carmel.\r\n\r\n[3692] Insignificant in height and extent, but celebrated in Scripture\r\nhistory. It still bears the name of Cape Carmel.\r\n\r\n[3693] It is not improbable that he means the town of Porphyrium, now\r\nKhaifa, at the foot of the mountain.\r\n\r\n[3694] Probably the Gitta of Polybius. Of it and Jeba, nothing is known.\r\n\r\n[3695] The Nahr-Naman, or Abou, on which Ptolemais was situate.\r\n\r\n[3696] Employed in the extensive manufacture of that article at Tyre\r\nand Sidon, to the north of this district.\r\n\r\n[3697] A corruption of Acco, the native name; from which the English\r\nname Acre, and the French St. Jean d’Acre. The earliest mention of it\r\nis in the Book of Judges, i. 31. It is supposed that it was Ptolemy I.,\r\nthe son of Lagus, who enlarged it and gave it the name of Ptolemais.\r\nIts citadel, however, still retained the name of Ace. Under the Romans,\r\nPtolemais, as mentioned by Pliny, was a colony, and belonged to\r\nGalilee. The modern city of Acre occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[3698] The Ach-Zib of Scripture, mentioned in Joshua xix. 29, and\r\nJudges i. 31. Its ruins are to be seen near the sea-shore, about three\r\nhours’ journey north of Acre. The spot is still called Es-Zib.\r\n\r\n[3699] Still called the Ras-el-Abiad, or White Promontory.\r\n\r\n[3700] A colony of the Sidonians: its scanty ruins are still to be seen\r\nat the poor village of Sur. The wars of the Crusades completed its\r\ndownfall. The island is still joined to the mainland by the mole which\r\nwas erected by Alexander the Great during the siege of the place; or,\r\naccording to some, by the Syrians themselves.\r\n\r\n[3701] Carthage is supposed to have been colonized _immediately_ by the\r\npeople of Utica.\r\n\r\n[3702] From which was made the famous Tyrian purple.\r\n\r\n[3703] Or “ancient Tyre,” which was built on the mainland.\r\n\r\n[3704] The Zarephath of 1 Kings xvii. 9, 10, whither Elijah was sent to\r\nthe widow, whose son he afterwards raised from the dead. Its site is\r\nnow known as Sarfand.\r\n\r\n[3705] Probably meaning “City of the Birds,” perhaps from the\r\nquantities of game in its vicinity. Its site now bears the name of\r\nAdlan.\r\n\r\n[3706] Its site is now called Saïda. In the time of David and Solomon,\r\nit was probably subject to the kings of Tyre.\r\n\r\n[3707] Cadmus, the founder of Thebes, was said to have been the son of\r\nits king Agenor.\r\n\r\n[3708] The Lebanon of Scripture. This intervening space, the ancient\r\nCœle-Syria, is now inhabited by the Druses.\r\n\r\n[3709] Perhaps the modern Nahr-el-Damur.\r\n\r\n[3710] Now Beyrout. By some it has been identified with the Berotha,\r\nor Berothai, of the Hebrew Scriptures. Its full name as a Roman colony\r\nwas, “Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Berytus.” It was colonized by the\r\nveterans of the Fifth, or Macedonian, and the Eighth, or Augustan,\r\nLegions. Beyrout, or Berut, is now, in a commercial point of view, the\r\nmost important place in Syria.\r\n\r\n[3711] Nothing is known of this place. The name seems to mean, the\r\n“Town of the Lion.”\r\n\r\n[3712] Now the Nahr-el-Kelb, or “Dog’s River.”\r\n\r\n[3713] The site of this place seems not to be known.\r\n\r\n[3714] Now the Nahr-el-Ibrahim.\r\n\r\n[3715] The modern town which stands on its site is called Jebeil. It\r\nis situate at the foot of Lebanon. The ancient name seems to have been\r\nGebal, and the Geblites are mentioned in Joshua, xiii. 5; 1 Kings,\r\nv. 18; and Ezek. xxvii. 9. The ruins of the ancient city are very\r\nextensive. Astarte and Isis seem to have been worshipped here.\r\n\r\n[3716] Now Batrun, a small town about twelve miles north of Byblus,\r\nsaid to have been founded by Ithobal, king of Tyre.\r\n\r\n[3717] Now Gazir, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[3718] Twelve miles from Tripolis. Its name would seem to bear\r\nreference to a trireme, or galley. It has been said that this is the\r\nplace referred to in the Book of Daniel, xi. 30.\r\n\r\n[3719] Polybius speaks of this place as being burnt by Antiochus. Its\r\nsite still bears the name of Calamon, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[3720] This properly consisted of three distinct cities, 600 feet\r\napart, each with its own walls, but all connected in a common\r\nconstitution; having one place of assembly, and forming in reality one\r\ncity only. They were colonies, as here suggested by Pliny, of Tyre,\r\nSidon, and Arados respectively. It is still a considerable place,\r\ncalled Tarabolos, or Tarablis, by the Turks.\r\n\r\n[3721] Its site is still known as Ortosa, or Tortosa.\r\n\r\n[3722] Probably the same as the Nahr-el-Kebir, or “Great River,” to the\r\nnorth of Tripolis. It may have derived its Greek name, which signifies\r\n“free,” from its similarity to that given to it by the people of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[3723] This was an important city, near Antarados. Its ruins are spoken\r\nof as very extensive. Simyra is still called Sumira.\r\n\r\n[3724] Now called Ruad; an island off the northern coast of Phœnicia,\r\nat a distance of twenty stadia from the mainland, Pliny falling short\r\nhere in his measurement. The city of Arados was very populous, though\r\nbuilt on a mere rock; and, contrary to Eastern custom, the houses\r\ncontained many stories. It is spoken of by the prophet Ezekiel under\r\nthe name of Arvad: see c. xxvii. 8, 11. In importance, it ranked next\r\nto the cities of Tyre and Sidon.\r\n\r\n[3725] Its modern name does not appear to be known.\r\n\r\n[3726] Also called Antarados, as lying nearly opposite to the city of\r\nArados. According to Strabo, the port of Antarados was called Carne,\r\nor Carnos. In the time of the Crusades, it was known under the name of\r\nTortosa. Its present name is Tartus.\r\n\r\n[3727] Now Banias. It was situate twenty-four miles north of Antarados.\r\nIts name is supposed to have originated in the baths in its vicinity.\r\nThe site is deserted; but a few ruins of the ancient town are still to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\n[3728] Eight miles from Balanea. Its ruins are known by the name of\r\nBoldo.\r\n\r\n[3729] Its site is now known as Djebeleh, a small village in the\r\nvicinity of Laodicea, or Latakia. The sun was probably worshipped here,\r\nand hence the Emperor Heliogabalus derived his name.\r\n\r\n[3730] About fifty miles south of Antioch, now called Ladikiyeh, or\r\nLatakia, noted for the excellence of its tobacco, which has an European\r\nreputation. It was built by Seleucus I., on the site of an earlier\r\ncity, called Ramitha. It was afterwards greatly favoured by Julius\r\nCæsar. Herod the Great built an aqueduct here, the ruins of which are\r\nstill in existence. It is now a poor Turkish village; but there are\r\nconsiderable remains of the ancient city to be seen in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[3731] It has been suggested, that Pliny means the city of Lydda, in\r\nthe tribe of Benjamin, which of course would be very much to the south,\r\nand quite out of the order in which he is proceeding. If that is not\r\nthe place meant, this Diospolis is utterly unknown.\r\n\r\n[3732] At some miles’ distance to the north of Laodicea. Pococke found\r\nsome traces of its site at a spot called Minta Baurdeleh, or the Bay of\r\nthe Tower.\r\n\r\n[3733] Pliny is in error here most probably, and is speaking of a place\r\nas being in Syria which in reality was in Cilicia, between Platanus and\r\nCragus. The name implies its situation near a mountain torrent.\r\n\r\n[3734] On a small bay, some miles north of Heraclea.\r\n\r\n[3735] Or Antioch, the capital of the Greek kings of Syria, and the\r\nmost famous of the sixteen cities built by Seleucus Nicator, and called\r\nafter the name of his father, (or son, as some say,) Antiochus. It was\r\nbuilt on the Orontes, and formed one of the most beautiful and pleasant\r\ncities of the ancient world. The modern Antakieh is a poor town, built\r\non the north-western part of the site of the ancient city, by the\r\nriver. The walls, built by Justinian, may still be traced for a circuit\r\nof four miles. Here the followers of our Saviour first obtained the\r\nname of “Christians.”\r\n\r\n[3736] That is, “Near Daphne,” there being a celebrated grove of that\r\nname, consecrated to Apollo, in its immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\n[3737] Now called the Nahr-el-Asy.\r\n\r\n[3738] Now Seleuca, or Kepse, at the foot of Mount Pieria. It has been\r\nreferred to in a previous note.\r\n\r\n[3739] Now known as Djebel-el-Akra.\r\n\r\n[3740] In the extreme north-east of Egypt. See pp. 422 and 424.\r\n\r\n[3741] The beginning of the fourth watch was three o’clock in the\r\nmorning. The height of this mountain does not in reality appear to be\r\nanything remarkable, and has been ascertained to be but 5318 feet.\r\nThere is probably no foundation for the marvellous story here told\r\nby Pliny; nevertheless, we are told by Spartianus, that the Emperor\r\nAdrian passed a night upon the mountain, for the purpose of seeing\r\nthis extraordinary sight; but a storm arising, it prevented the\r\ngratification of his curiosity. It lay near Nymphæum and Seleucia, and\r\nits base was washed by the waters of the Orontes.\r\n\r\n[3742] Or Baalbec, in the interior of Syria.\r\n\r\n[3743] According to Ansart, it still retains that name.\r\n\r\n[3744] Now called Bylan. This was the name of the narrow pass between a\r\nportion of Mount Taurus and the Rock of Rossicum. According to Ansart,\r\nthe spot is called at the present day Saggal Doutan.\r\n\r\n[3745] This was a Phœnician colony, on the eastern side of the Gulf of\r\nIssus; it is said by Ansart still to retain its ancient name.\r\n\r\n[3746] Now called Alma-Dagh, a branch of Mount Taurus, running from\r\nthe head of the Gulf of Issus, north-east, to the principal chain, and\r\ndividing Syria from Cilicia and Cappadocia. There were two passes in\r\nit, the Syrian Gates and the Amanian Gates. It is often spoken of by\r\nCicero, who was the Roman governor of Cilicia.\r\n\r\n[3747] The locality of this place is unknown, as Pliny is the only\r\nauthor who mentions it.\r\n\r\n[3748] Now Kulat-el-Mudik, situate in the valley of the Orontes, and\r\ncapital of the province of Apamene. It was fortified and enlarged\r\nby Seleucus Nicator, who gave it its name, after his wife Apama. It\r\nalso bore the Macedonian name of Pella. It was situate on a hill, and\r\nwas so far surrounded by the windings of the Orontes, as to become a\r\npeninsula, whence its name of Chersonesus. Very extensive ruins of this\r\nplace still exist.\r\n\r\n[3749] It is suggested, that these are the Phylarchi Arabes of Strabo,\r\nnow called the Nosairis, who were situate to the east of Apamea. The\r\nriver Marsyas here mentioned was a small tributary of the Orontes, into\r\nwhich it falls on the east side, near Apamea.\r\n\r\n[3750] This was situate in Cyrrhestica, in Syria, on the high road\r\nfrom Antioch to Mesopotamia, twenty-four miles to the west of the\r\nEuphrates, and thirty-six to the south-west of Zeugma; two and a half\r\ndays’ journey from Berœa, and five from Antioch. It obtained its Greek\r\nname of the “Sacred City” from Seleucus Nicator, owing to its being the\r\nchief seat of the worship of the Syrian goddess Astarte. Its ruins were\r\nfirst discovered by Maundrell.\r\n\r\n[3751] In the former editions it is “Magog;” but Sillig’s reading of\r\n“Mabog” is correct, and corresponds with the Oriental forms of Munbedj,\r\nManbesja, Manbesjun, Menba, Manba, Manbegj, and the modern name, Kara\r\nBambuche, or Buguk Munbedj.\r\n\r\n[3752] Astarte, the semi-fish goddess.\r\n\r\n[3753] This Chalcis is supposed to have been situate somewhere in the\r\ndistrict of the Buckaa, probably south of Heliopolis, or Baalbec. It\r\nhas been suggested, that its site may have been at, or near Zahle; in\r\nthe vicinity of which, at the village of Heusn Nieba, are to be seen\r\nsome remarkable remains. Or else, possibly, at Majdel Anjar, where\r\nAbulfeda speaks of great ruins of hewn stone.\r\n\r\n[3754] Ansart suggests, that Belus is here the name of a mountain, and\r\nthat it may be the same that is now called Djebel-il-Semmaq.\r\n\r\n[3755] To the north of Chalcidene, a town of Syria, on the slopes of\r\nthe Taurus, eighty miles to the north-cast of Antioch. In the Roman\r\ntimes, it was the head-quarters of the Tenth Legion. The ruins near the\r\nmodern village of Corus represent the ancient Cyrrhus. Of the Gazatæ\r\nand Gindareni, nothing is known.\r\n\r\n[3756] Possibly meaning the “Burghers of Granum.” Nothing is known of\r\nthese people.\r\n\r\n[3757] The people of Emesa, a city in the district of Apamene, on\r\nthe right, or eastern bank of the Orontes, to which, in C. 26 of the\r\npresent Book, Pliny assigns a desert district beyond Palmyra. It was\r\ncelebrated in ancient times for its magnificent temple of the sun,\r\nand the appointment of its priest, Bassianus, or Heliogabalus, to the\r\nimperial dignity, in his fourteenth year. It was made a colony, with\r\nthe _jus Italicum_, by Caracalla, and afterwards became the capital of\r\nPhœnicia Libanesia. The present name of its site is Hems.\r\n\r\n[3758] The Hylatæ are totally unknown. Ituræa was situate in the\r\nnorth-east of Palestine, and, with Trachonitis, belonged to the\r\ntetrarchy of Philip. Its boundaries cannot be precisely determined; but\r\nit may probably be traversed by a line drawn from the Lake of Tiberias\r\nto Damascus.\r\n\r\n[3759] According to Ptolemy, the people of Mariama, some miles to the\r\nwest of Emesa.\r\n\r\n[3760] In the district of Laodicea, according to Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[3761] Near the Portæ Amani, or “Passes of Amanus.”\r\n\r\n[3762] Pinara was near Pagræ, in Pieria, last mentioned.\r\n\r\n[3763] Probably Seleucia, in Mesopotamia, now called Bir, on the left\r\nbank of the Euphrates, opposite to the ford of Zeugma, a fortress of\r\nconsiderable importance.\r\n\r\n[3764] Its site is doubtful. Sebj d’Aboulgazi has been suggested.\r\n\r\n[3765] The people of Arethusa, a city of Syria, not far from Apamea,\r\nsituate between Epiphania and Emesa. In later times, it took the name\r\nof Restan.\r\n\r\n[3766] The people of Berœa, a town of Syria, midway between Antioch and\r\nHierapolis. Seleucus Nicator gave to it the Macedonian name of Berœa;\r\nbut, in A.D. 638, it resumed its ancient name of Chaleb, or Chalybon.\r\nThe modern Haleb, or Aleppo, occupies its site. Some excavations, on\r\nthe eastern side of it, are the only vestiges of ancient remains in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[3767] The people of Epiphanæa, placed by Ptolemy in the district\r\nof Cassiotis, in which also Antioch and Larissa were situate. The\r\nItinerary of Antoninus places it sixteen miles from Larissa, thirty-two\r\nfrom Emesa, and 101 from Antioch of Syria. It is supposed to have been\r\nidentical with the ancient Hamath, mentioned in 2 Sam. viii. 9; 1 Kings\r\nviii. 65; Isaiah x. 9, and called “Hamath the great” in Amos vi. 2,\r\nwhich name it also retained in the time of St. Jerome.\r\n\r\n[3768] The people of Laodicea ad Libanum, a city of Cœle-Syria, at\r\nthe northern entrance to the narrow valley, between Libanus and\r\nAnti-Libanus. During the possession of Cœle-Syria by the Greek kings of\r\nEgypt, it was the south-west border fortress of Syria. It was the chief\r\ncity of a district called Laodicene.\r\n\r\n[3769] Of Leucas, or Leucadia, nothing is known. Larissa, in Syria, was\r\na city in the district of Apamene, on the western bank of the Orontes,\r\nabout half-way between Apamea and Epiphania. The site is now called\r\nKulat-Seijar.\r\n\r\n[3770] In the western branch of the plateau of Iran, a portion of\r\nthe Taurus chain. Considerable changes in the course of the lower\r\nportion of the river have taken place since the time when Pliny wrote.\r\nCaranitis is the modern Arzrum, or Erzrúm, of the Turks.\r\n\r\n[3771] Now called Dujik Tagh, a mountain of Armenia.\r\n\r\n[3772] It has been suggested, that the proper reading here would be\r\n_Xerxene_.\r\n\r\n[3773] Probably the district where the goddess Anais was worshipped,\r\nwho is mentioned by Pliny in B. xxxiii. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[3774] From the place of confluence where the two mountain streams\r\nforming the Euphrates unite. This spot is now known as Kebban Ma’den.\r\n\r\n[3775] A fortress upon the river Euphrates, in Lesser Armenia. It has\r\nbeen identified with the ferry and lead-mines of Kebban Ma’den, the\r\npoints where the Kara Su is joined by the Myrad-Chaï, at a distance\r\nof 270 miles from its source; the two streams forming, by their\r\nconfluence, the Euphrates.\r\n\r\n[3776] Other readings have “Pastona” here, said by D’Anville to be the\r\nmodern Pastek.\r\n\r\n[3777] Called the metropolis of Lesser Armenia by Procopius. It was\r\nsituate between Anti-Taurus and the Euphrates, and celebrated for its\r\nfertility, more especially in fruit-trees, oil, and wine. The site\r\nof the city Melitene is now called Malatiyah, on a tributary of the\r\nEuphrates, and near that river itself.\r\n\r\n[3778] It is generally supposed that “twenty-four” would be the correct\r\nreading here.\r\n\r\n[3779] There were two places of this name. The one here spoken of was\r\na town of Lesser Armenia, on the right bank of the Euphrates, at the\r\nfirst, or principal curve, which takes place before the river enters\r\nMount Taurus. It is represented by the modern Iz Oghlu.\r\n\r\n[3780] No other writer is found to make mention of the Lycus, which\r\nflows into the Euphrates, though there is a river formerly so called,\r\nwhich flows into the Tigris below Larissa, the modern Nimroud.\r\nD’Anville is of opinion, that it is formed from the numerous springs,\r\ncalled by the people of the district Bing-gheul, or the “Thousand\r\nSprings.”\r\n\r\n[3781] Now called the Myrad-Chaï. Ritter considers it to be the south\r\narm of the Euphrates. The Arsanus is mentioned by no writer except\r\nPliny.\r\n\r\n[3782] The defile at this place is now called the Cataract of Nachour,\r\naccording to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[3783] The more general reading here is “Omira.” Hardouin is of\r\nopinion, that this is the district referred to in the Book of Judith,\r\nii. 24. In the Vulgate, it appears to be twice called the river\r\n_Mambre_; but in our version it is called _Arbonaï_.\r\n\r\n[3784] Burnouf has concluded, from a cuneiform inscription which he\r\ndeciphered, that the name of this people was Ayurâ, and that Hardouin\r\nis wrong in conjecturing that it was a name derived from the Greek\r\nὄρος, “a mountain,” and designating the people as a mountain tribe. If\r\nBurnouf is right, the proper reading here would seem to be Arœi, or\r\nArrhœi.\r\n\r\n[3785] The length of the _schœnus_ has been mentioned by our author in\r\nC. 11 of the present Book. M. Saigey makes the Persian parasang to be\r\nvery nearly the same length as the schœnus of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[3786] Commagene was a district in the north of Syria, bounded by the\r\nEuphrates on the east, by Cilicia on the west, and by Amanus on the\r\nnorth. Its capital was Samosata.\r\n\r\n[3787] The place here spoken of by Pliny is probably the same mentioned\r\nby Ptolemy as in Cataonia, one of the provinces of Cappadocia.\r\nAccording to Parisot, the site of the place is called at the present\r\nday ‘Ra Claudie.’\r\n\r\n[3788] Salmasius has confounded these cataracts with those of Nachour,\r\nor Elegia, previously mentioned. It is evident, however, that they are\r\nnot the same.\r\n\r\n[3789] Now called Someisat. In literary history, it is celebrated as\r\nbeing the birth-place of the satirist Lucian. Nothing remains of it but\r\na heap of ruins, on an artificial mound.\r\n\r\n[3790] In the district of Osrhoëne, in the northern part of\r\nMesopotamia. It was situate on the Syrtus, now the Daisan, a small\r\ntributary of the Euphrates. Pliny speaks rather loosely when he places\r\nit in Arabia. It is supposed that it bore the name of Antiochia during\r\nthe reign of the Syrian king, Antiochus IV. The modern town of Orfahor\r\nUnfah is supposed to represent its site.\r\n\r\n[3791] “The beautiful stream.” It is generally supposed that this was\r\nanother name of Edessa.\r\n\r\n[3792] Supposed to be the Haran, or Charan, of the Old Testament.\r\nIt was here, as alluded to by Pliny, that Crassus was defeated and\r\nslain by the Parthian general, Surena. It was situate in Osroëne, in\r\nMesopotamia, and not far from Edessa. According to Stephanus, it had\r\nits name from Carrha, a river of Syria, and was celebrated in ancient\r\ntimes for its temple of Luna, or Lunus.\r\n\r\n[3793] According to Strabo, the Aborras, now the Khabur, flowed round\r\nthis town. By Tacitus it is called Anthemusias. According to Isidorus\r\nof Charax, it lay between Edessa and the Euphrates.\r\n\r\n[3794] Now Rakkah, a fortified town of Mesopotamia, on the Euphrates,\r\nnear the mouth of the river Bilecha. It was built by order of Alexander\r\nthe Great, and completed probably by Seleucus. It is supposed to\r\nhave been the same place as Callinicum, the fortifications of which\r\nwere repaired by Justinian. Its name was changed in later times to\r\nLeontopolis by the Emperor Leo.\r\n\r\n[3795] Now called Sinjar, according to Brotier. Some writers imagine\r\nthat this was the site of “the plain in the land of Shinar,” on which\r\nthe Tower of Babel was built, mentioned in the Book of Genesis, xi. 2.\r\n\r\n[3796] Mentioned in C. 17 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[3797] Probably not that in the district of Cassiotis, and on the\r\nwestern bank of the Orontes, mentioned in C. 19 of the present Book.\r\nOf this locality nothing seems to be known, except that Dupinet states\r\nthat it is now called Adelphe by the Turks.\r\n\r\n[3798] Probably the “Antiochia ad Taurum” mentioned by the geographer\r\nStephanus, and by Ptolemy. Some writers place it at the modern Aintab,\r\nseventy-five miles north-east of Aleppo.\r\n\r\n[3799] Now called Roum-Cala, or the “Roman Castle.” For Zeugma see p.\r\n424.\r\n\r\n[3800] In the north-east of the district of Astropatene, originally\r\ncalled Rhaga. It was rebuilt by Seleucus Nicator, and by him called\r\nEuropus. Colonel Rawlinson has identified it with the present Veramin,\r\nat no great distance from the ancient Rhages.\r\n\r\n[3801] Its ruins are to be seen at the ford of El Hamman, near the\r\nmodern Rakkah. It stood on the banks of the Euphrates; and here was\r\nthe usual, and, for a long time, the only ford of the Euphrates. It is\r\nsupposed to have derived its name from the Aramean word “Thiphsach,”\r\nsignifying “a ford.”\r\n\r\n[3802] Or “Dwellers in Tents.” See p. 422.\r\n\r\n[3803] According to Ortelius and Hardouin, this is the place called\r\nSura by Pliny, in C. 26 of the present Book; but Parisot differs from\r\nthat opinion. Bochart suggests, that “Ur, of the Chaldees,” is the\r\nplace referred to under this name; but, as Hardouin observes, that\r\nplace lay at a considerable distance to the south.\r\n\r\n[3804] So called from the circumstance that Palmyra stood in the midst\r\nof them. It was built by King Solomon, in an oasis of the Desert,\r\nin the midst of palm groves, from which it received its Greek name,\r\nwhich was a translation also of the Hebrew “Tadmor,” “the city of\r\npalm-trees.” It lay at a considerable distance from the Euphrates. Its\r\nsite presents considerable ruins; but they are all of the Roman period,\r\nand greatly inferior to those of Baalbec or Heliopolis.\r\n\r\n[3805] The rock fortress of the Idumæans in Arabia Petræa, now called\r\nWady-Musa, half-way between the head of the Gulf of Akabah and the Dead\r\nSea.\r\n\r\n[3806] Which it continued to do until it was conquered under its\r\nqueen, Zenobia, by the Emperor Aurelian, in A.D. 270. It was partially\r\ndestroyed by him, but was afterwards fortified by Justinian; though it\r\nnever recovered its former greatness.\r\n\r\n[3807] See B. vi. c. 30.\r\n\r\n[3808] Pliny is the only author that makes mention of Stelendene.\r\n\r\n[3809] In C. 19 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[3810] Previously mentioned by Pliny. See p. 439. Of Elatium nothing is\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n[3811] The same place that is also mentioned in history as Flavia Firma\r\nSura. The site of Philiscum is totally unknown.\r\n\r\n[3812] Nothing is known of this place.\r\n\r\n[3813] Parisot remarks, that it is true that the Euphrates increases\r\nperiodically, much in the same manner as the Nile; but that its\r\nincrease does not arise from similar causes, nor are the same results\r\nproduced by it, seeing that the river does not convey the same volume\r\nof water as the Nile, and that the country in the vicinity of its bed\r\ndoes not, like Egypt, form a valley pent up between two ranges of hills.\r\n\r\n[3814] So called probably from the Greek διαφανὴς, “transparent.” It\r\nhas not been identified, but it was no doubt a small stream falling\r\ninto the Gulf of Issus.\r\n\r\n[3815] Or “Passes.” As to Mount Amanus, see C. 18 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[3816] Parisot suggests that this is the Chersos of Xenophon, the\r\nmodern Kermes.\r\n\r\n[3817] The Deli-Su of modern times according to D’Anville, the Maher-Su\r\naccording to Pococke.\r\n\r\n[3818] Pliny is the only writer that mentions this river Lycus.\r\n\r\n[3819] The Gulf of Issos is now called the Gulf of Scanderoon or\r\nIskenderun, from the town of that name, the former Alexandria ad Issum,\r\nmentioned here by Pliny. In the vicinity of Issus, Alexander defeated\r\nthe army of Darius. The exact site of the town appears not to have been\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n[3820] Which still preserves its name in Iskenderun, on the east side\r\nof the Gulf. It probably received its name in honour of Alexander the\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\n[3821] Or the “Green” River. Its identity is unknown.\r\n\r\n[3822] Now called Ayas Kala or Kalassy. It was a place, in the Roman\r\nperiod, of some importance.\r\n\r\n[3823] The modern river Jihan.\r\n\r\n[3824] Or “Passes” of Cilicia, through the range of Taurus.\r\n\r\n[3825] Called Mallo in modern times, according to Hardouin and Dupinet.\r\n\r\n[3826] At the mouth of the Pyramus, according to Tzetzes.\r\n\r\n[3827] Famous as the birth-place of St. Paul, the Apostle of the\r\nGentiles. Its ruins still bear the name of Tersus. During the civil\r\nwar it took part with Julius Cæsar, and from him received the name of\r\nJuliopolis.\r\n\r\n[3828] They lie between the rivers Djihoun and Syhoun, according to\r\nAnsart.\r\n\r\n[3829] Now called Messis, according to D’Anville and Mannert. The site\r\nof Cassipolis, or Cassiopolis according to some readings, is unknown.\r\n\r\n[3830] The sites of Thynos and Zephyrium appear to be unknown. Anchiale\r\nwas situate on the coast, upon the river Anchialeus, according to the\r\ngeographer Stephanus. Aristobulus, quoted by Strabo, says that at\r\nthis place was the tomb of Sardanapalus, and on it a relief in stone\r\nrepresenting a man snapping the fingers of the right hand. He adds,\r\n“It is said that there is an Assyrian inscription also, recording that\r\nSardanapalus built Anchiale and Tarsus in one day, and exhorting the\r\nreader to eat, drink, &c., as everything else is not worth That, the\r\nmeaning of which was shown by the attitude of the figure.” Athenæus\r\nhowever cites Amyntas as his authority for stating that the tomb of\r\nSardanapalus was at Nineveh. Leake is of opinion that a mound on the\r\nbanks of the river beyond the modern villages of Kazalu and Karaduar\r\nforms the remains of Anchiale.\r\n\r\n[3831] The modern Syhou, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[3832] Now called the Tersoos Chai. It is remarkable for the coldness\r\nof its waters, and it was here that Alexander the Great nearly met with\r\nhis death from bathing when heated, in the stream.\r\n\r\n[3833] Now Chelendreh. It was a strong place on the coast, situate on\r\na high rock nearly surrounded by the sea. None of its ruins seem older\r\nthan the early period of the Roman empire. The Turks call it Gulnare.\r\n\r\n[3834] Probably so called from a temple to the Sea Nymphs there.\r\n\r\n[3835] To distinguish it from Solæ or Soli of Cyprus. It was situate\r\nbetween the rivers Cydnus and Lamus, and was said to have been\r\ncolonized by Argives and Lydians from Rhodes. Alexander mulcted its\r\ninhabitants of 200 talents, for their adhesion to the Persians. It was\r\ncelebrated as the birth-place of the Stoic philosopher Chrysippus, the\r\ncomic poet Philemon, and the poet and astronomer Aratus. Its name is\r\nperpetuated in the word _Solecism_, which is said to have been first\r\napplied to the corrupt dialect of Greek spoken by the inhabitants of\r\nthis city, or as some say, of Soli in Cyprus.\r\n\r\n[3836] It still retains its ancient name, and is situate on the western\r\nside of the Sarus, now the Syhoun or Syhan. Pompey settled here some of\r\nthe Cilician pirates whom he had conquered.\r\n\r\n[3837] Leake, in his ‘Asia Minor,’ p. 196, says, “The vestiges of\r\nCibyra are probably those observed by Captain Beaufort upon a height\r\nwhich rises from the right bank of a considerable river about eight\r\nmiles to the eastward of the Melas, about four miles to the west of\r\nCape Karáburnu, and nearly two miles from the shore.” Ptolemy mentions\r\nCibyra as an inland town of Cilicia Trachea, but Scylax places it on\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\n[3838] Its ruins are still called Pinara or Minara. It was an inland\r\ncity of Lycia, some distance west of the river Xanthus, and at the foot\r\nof Mount Cragus.\r\n\r\n[3839] Or perhaps ‘Podalie.’ Of it nothing seems to be known.\r\n\r\n[3840] Or Selinuntum, now Selenti, on the coast of Cilicia. In\r\nconsequence of the death here of the Emperor Trajan, it received the\r\nname of Trajanopolis. Of Ale, if that is the correct reading, nothing\r\nwhatever is known.\r\n\r\n[3841] On the coast of Cilicia; mentioned by Strabo as having a port.\r\nLeake places it at or near the ruined castle called Sokhta Kalesi,\r\nbelow which is a port, and a peninsula on the east side of the harbour\r\ncovered with ruins.\r\n\r\n[3842] In the district of Selenitis. It has been identified with the\r\nsite of the modern fortress of Lambardo. It is also suggested that it\r\nmay have been the same place as Laerte, the native city of Diogenes\r\nLaertius. Of Doron nothing seems to be known.\r\n\r\n[3843] Its ruins are supposed to be those seen by Leake near the island\r\nof Crambusa. Here the walls of an ancient city may still be traced, and\r\na mole of unhewn rocks projects from one angle of the fortress about\r\n100 yards across the bay.\r\n\r\n[3844] Strabo describes this cave as a vast hollow of circular form,\r\nsurrounded by a margin of rock on all sides of considerable height; on\r\ndescending it, the ground was found full of shrubs, both evergreens and\r\ncultivated, and in some parts the best saffron was grown. He also says\r\nthat there was a cave which contained a large spring, from which arose\r\na river of clear water which immediately afterwards sank into the earth\r\nand flowed underground into the sea. It was called the Bitter Water.\r\nThis cave, so famed in ancient times, does not appear to have been\r\nexamined by any modern traveller. It was said to have been the bed of\r\nthe giant Typhon or Typhœus.\r\n\r\n[3845] Now known as the Ghiuk-Su.\r\n\r\n[3846] Supposed to be the same as the modern Lessan-el-Kahpeh.\r\n\r\n[3847] Or Holmi, on the coast of Cilicia Tracheia, a little to the\r\nsouth-west of Seleucia. Leake thinks that the modern town of Aghaliman\r\noccupies the site of Holmœ.\r\n\r\n[3848] Probably the same place as the Aphrodisias mentioned by Livy,\r\nDiodorus Siculus, and Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[3849] On the headland now called Cape Anemour, the most southerly\r\npart of Asia Minor. Beaufort discovered on the point indications of a\r\nconsiderable ancient town.\r\n\r\n[3850] Its site is now called Alaya or Alanieh. This spot was Strabo’s\r\nboundary-line between Pamphylia and Cilicia. Some slight remains of the\r\nancient town were seen here by Beaufort, but no inscriptions were found.\r\n\r\n[3851] Identified by Beaufort with the modern Manaugat-Su.\r\n\r\n[3852] So called, either from an adjacent mountain of that name, or\r\nits founder, Anazarbus. Its later name was Cæsarea ad Anazarbum. Its\r\nsite is called Anawasy or Amnasy, and is said to display considerable\r\nremains of the ancient town. Of Augusta nothing is known: Ptolemy\r\nplaces it in a district called Bryelice.\r\n\r\n[3853] Identified by Ainsworth with the ruins seen at Kara Kaya in\r\nCilicia.\r\n\r\n[3854] Pompey settled some of the Cilician pirates here after his\r\ndefeat of them. It was thirty miles east of Anazarbus, but its site\r\ndoes not appear to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[3855] An island off the shore of Cilicia, also called Sebaste.\r\n\r\n[3856] Some of the MSS. read “Riconium” here.\r\n\r\n[3857] Its ruins are called Selefkeh. This was an important city of\r\nSeleucia Aspera, built by Seleucus I. on the western bank of the river\r\nCalycadnus. It had an oracle of Apollo, and annual games in honour of\r\nZeus Olympius. It was a free city under the Romans. It was here that\r\nFrederick Barbarossa, the emperor of Germany, died. Its ruins are\r\npicturesque and extensive.\r\n\r\n[3858] Meaning that the inhabitants of Holmia were removed by Seleucus\r\nto his new city of Seleucia.\r\n\r\n[3859] Said by Vitruvius to have had the property of anointing those\r\nwho bathed in its waters. If so, it probably had its name from the\r\nGreek word λιπαρὸς, “fat.” It flowed past the town of Soloë. Bombos and\r\nParadisus are rivers which do not appear to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[3860] A branch of the Taurus range.\r\n\r\n[3861] It bordered in the east on Lycaonia, in the north on Phrygia, in\r\nthe west on Pisidia, and in the south on Cilicia and Pamphylia.\r\n\r\n[3862] A well-fortified city at the foot of Mount Taurus. It was\r\ntwice destroyed, first by its inhabitants when besieged by Perdiccas,\r\nand again by the Roman general Servilius Isauricus. Strabo says that\r\nAmyntas of Galatea built a new city in its vicinity out of the ruins\r\nof the old one. D’Anville and others have identified the site of Old\r\nIsauria with the modern Bei Sheher, and they are of opinion that Seidi\r\nSheher occupies the site of New Isaura, but Hamilton thinks that the\r\nruins on a hill near the village of Olou Bounar mark the site of New\r\nIsaura. Of the two next places nothing seems to be known at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[3863] In the last Chapter.\r\n\r\n[3864] In Pisidia, at the southern extremity of Lake Caralitis.\r\nTacitus, Annals, iii. 48, says that this people possessed forty-four\r\nfortresses: whereas Strabo speaks of them as the most barbarous of all\r\nthe Pisidian tribes, dwelling only in caves. They were conquered by the\r\nconsul Quirinius in the time of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[3865] Pisidia was a mountainous region formed by that part of the main\r\nchain of Mount Taurus which sweeps round in a semicircle parallel to\r\nthe shore of the Pamphylian Gulf; the shore itself at the foot of the\r\nmountains forming the district of Pamphylia. On the south-east it was\r\nbounded by Cilicia, on the east and north-east by Lycaonia and Isauria,\r\nand by Phrygia Parorios on the north, where its boundaries greatly\r\nvaried at different times.\r\n\r\n[3866] Generally called “Antioch of Pisidia,” was situate on the south\r\nside of the mountain boundary between Phrygia and Pisidia. The modern\r\nYalobatch is supposed to occupy its site. The remains of the ancient\r\ntown are numerous. Its title of Cæsarea was probably given to it on its\r\nbecoming a Roman colony early in the imperial period.\r\n\r\n[3867] D’Anville suggests that the modern Haviran occupies its site,\r\nand that Sadjakla stands on that of Sagalessos.\r\n\r\n[3868] This country was bounded on the north by Galatia, on the east\r\nby Cappadocia, on the south by Cilicia Aspera, on the south-west by\r\nIsauria and Phrygia Parorios, and on the north-west by Great Phrygia.\r\nIt was assigned under the Persian empire to the satrapy of Cappadocia,\r\nbut considered by the Greek and Roman geographers the south-east part\r\nof Phrygia.\r\n\r\n[3869] Phrygia, or the western part of Asia, the first part of the\r\nAsiatic continent that received the name of Asia. Sec Chapters 28 & 29\r\nof the present Book.\r\n\r\n[3870] D’Anville thinks that the place called Il-Goun occupies the site\r\nof Philomela.\r\n\r\n[3871] Hardouin suggests that the reading here is “Tibriani,” the\r\npeople of Tibrias. Ansart is of opinion that Thymbrium is meant, the\r\nplace at which Cyrus defeated the army of Crœsus.\r\n\r\n[3872] Its site is unknown. It was probably so called from the quarries\r\nof white stone or marble in its vicinity. Pelta and Tyrium are also\r\nequally unknown.\r\n\r\n[3873] Iconium was regarded in the time of Xenophon as the easternmost\r\ntown of Phrygia, while all the later authorities described it as the\r\nprincipal city of Lycaonia. In the Acts of the Apostles it is described\r\nas a very populous city, inhabited by Greeks and Jews. Its site is now\r\ncalled Kunjah or Koniyeh.\r\n\r\n[3874] It has been suggested that this may be the Tarbassus of\r\nArtemidorus, quoted by Strabo. Hyde was in later times one of the\r\nepiscopal cities of Lycaonia.\r\n\r\n[3875] Their district is called Melyas by Herodotus, B. i. c. 173. The\r\ncity of Arycanda is unknown.\r\n\r\n[3876] United with Cilicia it now forms the province of Caramania or\r\nKermanieh. It was a narrow strip of the southern coast of Asia Minor,\r\nextending in an arch along the Pamphylian Gulf between Lycia on the\r\nwest, Cilicia on the east, and on the north bordering on Pisidia.\r\n\r\n[3877] Tradition ascribed the first Greek settlements in this country\r\nto Mopsus, son of Apollo (or of Rhacius), after the Trojan war.\r\n\r\n[3878] Now called the Gulf of Adalia, lying between Cape Khelidonia and\r\nCape Anemour.\r\n\r\n[3879] Now called Candeloro, according to D’Anville and Beaufort.\r\n\r\n[3880] Or Aspendus, an Argeian colony on the river Eurymedon. The\r\n“mountain” of Pliny is nothing but a hill or piece of elevated ground.\r\nIt is supposed that it still retains its ancient name. In B. xxxi. c.\r\n7, Pliny mentions a salt lake in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[3881] Hardouin suggests that the correct reading is ‘Petnelessum.’\r\n\r\n[3882] A city of remarkable splendour, between the rivers Catarrhactes\r\nand Cestrus, sixty stadia from the mouth of the former. It was a\r\ncelebrated seat of the worship of Artemis or Diana. In the later Roman\r\nempire it was the capital of Pamphylia Secunda. It was the first place\r\nvisited by St. Paul in Asia Minor. See Acts, xiii. 13 and xiv. 25.\r\nIts splendid ruins are still to be seen at Murtana, sixteen miles\r\nnorth-east of Adalia.\r\n\r\n[3883] Now known as the Kapri-Su.\r\n\r\n[3884] Now called Duden-Su. It descends the mountains of Taurus in a\r\ngreat broken waterfall, whence its name.\r\n\r\n[3885] Probably occupying the site of the modern Atalieh or Satalieh.\r\n\r\n[3886] On the borders of Lycia and Pamphylia, at the foot of Mount\r\nSolyma. Its ruins now bear the name of Tekrova.\r\n\r\n[3887] It was inclosed by Caria and Pamphylia on the west and east, and\r\non the north by the district of Cibyrates in Phrygia.\r\n\r\n[3888] The Gulf of Satalieh or Adalia.\r\n\r\n[3889] Still known as Cape Khelidonia or Cameroso.\r\n\r\n[3890] Parisot remarks here, “Pliny describes on this occasion, with an\r\nexactness very remarkable for his time, the chain of mountains which\r\nruns through the part of Asia known to the ancients, although it is\r\nevident that he confines the extent of them within much too small a\r\ncompass.”\r\n\r\n[3891] The Caspian and the Hyrcanian Seas are generally looked upon\r\nas identical, but we find them again distinguished by Pliny in B. vi.\r\nc. 13, where he says that this inland sea commences to be called the\r\n_Caspian_ after you have passed the river Cyrus (or Kúr), and that the\r\nCaspii live near it; and in C. 16, that it is called the _Hyrcanian_\r\nSea, from the Hyrcani who live along its shores. The western side would\r\ntherefore in strictness be called the _Caspian_, and the eastern the\r\n_Hyrcanian_ Sea.\r\n\r\n[3892] “The name of Imaüs was, in the first instance, applied by the\r\nGreek geographers to the Hindú-Kúsh and to the chain parallel to the\r\nequator, to which the name of Himâlaya is usually given at the present\r\nday. The name was gradually extended to the intersection running north\r\nand south, the meridian axis of Central Asia, or the _Bolor_ range. The\r\ndivisions of Asia into ‘intra et extra Imaum,’ were unknown to Strabo\r\nand Pliny, though the latter describes the knot of mountains formed\r\nby the intersections of the Himâlaya, the Hindú-Kúsh, and Bolor, by\r\nthe expression ‘quorum (Montes Emodi) promontorium Imaüs vocatur.’ The\r\nBolor chain has been for ages, with one or two exceptions, the boundary\r\nbetween the empires of China and Turkestan.”—_Dr. Smith’s Dictionary of\r\nAncient Geography._\r\n\r\n[3893] The Gates of Armenia are spoken of in B. vi. c. 12, the Gates of\r\nthe Caspian in C. 16 of the same Book, and the Gates of Cilicia in C.\r\n22 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[3894] See C. ix. of the next Book.\r\n\r\n[3895] “Strabo gives this name to only the eastern portion of the\r\nCaucasian chain which overhangs the Caspian Sea and forms the northern\r\nboundary of Albania, and in which he places the Amazons. Mela seems to\r\napply the name to the whole chain which other writers call Caucasus,\r\nconfining the latter term to a part of it. Pliny (B. v. c. 27 & B. vi.\r\nc. 11) gives precisely the same representation, with the additional\r\nerror of making the Ceraunii (_i. e._ the Caucasus of others) part of\r\nthe Great Taurus Chain. He seems to apply the name of Caucasus to the\r\nspurs which spread out both to the north-east and the south-east from\r\nthe main chain near its eastern extremity, and which he regarded as a\r\ncontinuous range, bordering the western shores of the Caspian. See B.\r\nvi. c. 10.”—_Dr. Smith’s Dictionary of Ancient Geography._\r\n\r\n[3896] Of Chelidonium, now Khelidonia, formed by the range of Taurus.\r\n\r\n[3897] See B. ii. c. 110. The flame which continually burned on this\r\nmountain has been examined by Beaufort, the modern traveller. The name\r\nof the mountain is now Yanar: it is formed of a mass of scaglia with\r\nserpentine. Spratt says that the flame is nothing more than a stream\r\nof inflammable gas issuing from a crevice, such as is seen in several\r\nplaces in the Apennines. By Homer it is represented as a fabulous\r\nmonster, which is explained by Servius, the commentator of Virgil, in\r\nthe following manner. He says that flames issue from the top of the\r\nmountain, and that there are lions in the vicinity; the middle part\r\nabounds in goats, and the lower part with serpents. Simena appears to\r\nbe unknown.\r\n\r\n[3898] So called from Ἥφαιστος, the Greek name of Vulcan. Pliny\r\nmentions this spot also in B. ii. c. 110. The flame probably proceeded\r\nfrom an inflammable gas, or else was ignited by a stream of naphtha.\r\n\r\n[3899] More generally known as Phœnicus, a flourishing city on Mount\r\nOlympus; now Yanar Dagh, a volcano on the eastern coast of Lycia, with\r\nwhich it often exchanged names. Having become the head-quarters of the\r\npirates, it was destroyed by the Roman general Servilius Isauricus. Its\r\nruins are to be seen at a spot called Deliktash.\r\n\r\n[3900] Mentioned again in B. xxxvi. c. 34, as the spot whence the\r\n_gagates lapis_ or ‘agate’ took its name. The ruins at Aladja are\r\nregarded by Leake as marking the site of Gagæ; but Sir Charles Fellowes\r\nidentifies the place with the modern village of Hascooe, the vicinity\r\nof which is covered with ruins.\r\n\r\n[3901] On the road from Phaselis in Lycia to Patara. Its site is a\r\nvillage called Hadgivella, about sixteen miles south-west of Phaselis.\r\nThe remains are very considerable.\r\n\r\n[3902] The remains of Rhodiopolis were found by Spratt and Forbes in\r\nthe vicinity of Corydalla.\r\n\r\n[3903] On the Limyrus, probably the modern Phineka; the ruins to the\r\nnorth of which are supposed to be those of Limyra.\r\n\r\n[3904] The modern Akhtar Dagh.\r\n\r\n[3905] Now Andraki. This was the port of Myra, next mentioned. It stood\r\nat the mouth of the river now known as the Andraki. Cramer observes\r\nthat it was here St. Paul was put on board the ship of Alexandria, Acts\r\nxxvii. 5, 6.\r\n\r\n[3906] Still called Myra by the Greeks, but Dembre by the Turks. It was\r\nbuilt on a rock twenty stadia from the sea. St. Paul touched here on\r\nhis voyage as a prisoner to Rome, and from the mention made of it in\r\nActs xxvii. 5, 6, it would appear to have been an important sea-port.\r\nThere are magnificent ruins of this city still to be seen, in part hewn\r\nout of the solid rock.\r\n\r\n[3907] From an inscription found by Cockerell at the head of the\r\nHassac Bay, it is thought that _Aperlæ_ is the proper name of this\r\nplace, though again there are coins of Gordian which give the name as\r\n_Aperræ_. It is fixed by the Stadismus as sixty stadia west of Somena,\r\nwhich Leake supposes to be the same as the Simena mentioned above by\r\nPliny.\r\n\r\n[3908] Now called Antephelo or Andifilo, on the south coast of Lycia,\r\nat the head of a bay. Its theatre is still complete, with the exception\r\nof the proscenium. There are also other interesting remains of\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\n[3909] Fellowes places the site of Phellos near a village called\r\n_Saaret_, west-north-west of Antiphellos, where he found the remains\r\nof a town; but Spratt considers this to mark the site of the Pyrra of\r\nPliny, mentioned above—judging from Pliny’s words. Modern geographers\r\ndeem it more consistent with his meaning to look for Phellos north of\r\nAntiphellos than in any other direction, and the ruins at Tchookoorbye,\r\nnorth of Antiphellos, on the spur of a mountain called Fellerdagh, are\r\nthought to be those of Phellos.\r\n\r\n[3910] The most famous city of Lycia. It stood on the western bank\r\nof the river of that name, now called the Echen Chai. It was twice\r\nbesieged, and on both occasions the inhabitants destroyed themselves\r\nwith their property, first by the Persians under Harpagus, and\r\nafterwards by the Romans under Brutus. Among its most famous temples\r\nwere those of Sarpedon and of the Lycian Apollo. The ruins now known\r\nby the name of Gunik, have been explored by Sir C. Fellows and other\r\ntravellers, and a portion of its remains are now to be seen in the\r\nBritish Museum, under the name of the Xanthian marbles.\r\n\r\n[3911] Its ruins still bear the same name. It was a flourishing\r\nseaport, on a promontory of the same name, sixty stadia east of the\r\nmouth of the Xanthus. It was early colonized by the Dorians from Crete,\r\nand became a chief seat of the worship of Apollo, from whose son\r\nPatarus it was said to have received its name. Ptolemy Philadelphus\r\nenlarged it, and called it Arsinoë, but it still remained better known\r\nby its old name. This place was visited by St. Paul, who thence took\r\nship for Phœnicia. See Acts xxi. 1.\r\n\r\n[3912] This was more properly the name of a mountain district of Lycia.\r\nStrabo speaks of Cragus, a mountain with eight summits, and a city of\r\nthe same name. Beaufort thinks that Yedy-Booroon, the Seven Capes, a\r\ngroup of high and rugged mountains, appear to have been the ancient\r\nMount Cragus of Lycia.\r\n\r\n[3913] Probably the Gulf of Macri, equal in size to the Gulf of\r\nSatalia, which is next to it.\r\n\r\n[3914] This place lay in the interior at the base of Cragus, and\r\nits ruins are still to be seen on the east side of the range, about\r\nhalf-way between Telmessus and the termination of the range on the\r\nsouth coast.\r\n\r\n[3915] Its ruins are to be seen at Mei, or the modern port of Macri.\r\n\r\n[3916] Its site is unknown. That of Candyba has been ascertained to be\r\na place called Gendevar, east of the Xanthus, and a few miles from the\r\ncoast. Its rock-tombs are said to be beautifully executed. The Œnian\r\ngrove or forest, it has been suggested, may still be recognized in the\r\nextensive pine forest that now covers the mountain above the city. The\r\nsites of Podalia and Choma seem to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[3917] In some editions “Cyane.” Leake says that this place was\r\ndiscovered to the west of Andriaca by Cockerell. It appears from\r\nScott and Forbes’s account of Lycia, that three sites have been found\r\nbetween port Tristorus and the inland valley of Kassabar, which from\r\nthe inscriptions appeared anciently to have borne this name, Yarvoo,\r\nGhiouristan, and Toussa. The former is the chief place and is covered\r\nwith ruins of the Roman and middle-age construction. At Ghiouristan\r\nthere are Lycian rock-tombs.\r\n\r\n[3918] Its ruins are to be seen near the modern Doover, in the interior\r\nof Lycia, about two miles and a half east of the river Xanthus. Of the\r\nthree places previously mentioned the sites appear to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[3919] Mentioned by the geographer Stephanus as being in Caria.\r\n\r\n[3920] Its site is fixed at Katara, on both sides of the Katara Su, the\r\nmost northern branch of the Xanthus. The ruins are very considerable,\r\nlying on both sides of the stream. Balbura is a neuter plural.\r\n\r\n[3921] It lay to the west of Balbura, near a place now called Ebajik,\r\non a small stream that flows into the Horzoom Tchy. In B. xxxv. c. 17,\r\nPliny mentions a kind of chalk found in the vicinity of this place. Its\r\nruins are still to be seen, but they are not striking.\r\n\r\n[3922] In the south-west corner of Asia Minor, bounded on the north and\r\nnorth-east by the mountains Messagis and Cadmus, dividing it from Lydia\r\nand Phrygia, and adjoining to Phrygia and Lycia on the south-east.\r\n\r\n[3923] Caria.\r\n\r\n[3924] Now Cape Ghinazi. It was also called Artemisium, from the temple\r\nof Artemis or Diana situate upon it.\r\n\r\n[3925] Discharging itself into the bay of Telmissus, now Makri.\r\n\r\n[3926] “Telmissus” is the reading here in some editions.\r\n\r\n[3927] Situate in the district of Caria called Peræa. It was also the\r\nname given to a mountainous district. In Hoskyn’s map the ruins of\r\nDædala are placed near the head of the Gulf of Glaucus, on the west\r\nof a small river called Inegi Chai, probably the ancient Ninus, where\r\nDædalus was bitten by a water-snake, in consequence of which he died.\r\n\r\n[3928] On the Gulf of Glaucus: Stephanus however places it in Lycia.\r\nMela speaks only of a promontory of this name.\r\n\r\n[3929] Leake places this river immediately west of the Gulf of Glaucus.\r\n\r\n[3930] Placed by Strabo sixty stadia from the sea, west of the Gulf\r\nof Glaucus, and east of Carinus. Its site is uncertain, but it may\r\npossibly be the place discovered by Fellows, which is proved by\r\ninscriptions to have been called Cadyanda, a name otherwise unknown to\r\nus. This lies N.N.E. of Makri, on the Gulf of Glaucus or Makri, at a\r\nplace called Hoozoomlee, situate on an elevated plain.\r\n\r\n[3931] The same as the river Calbis of Strabo and Mela, at present the\r\nDalamon Tchy, Quingi or Taas, having its sources in Mount Cadmus above\r\nCibyra. It was said to have derived its name from an Indian, who had\r\nbeen thrown into it from an elephant.\r\n\r\n[3932] Their district was Cibyratis, of which the chief city was\r\nCibyra. This place, uniting with the towns of Balbura, Bubon, and\r\nŒnianda, had the name of Tetrapolis; of which league Cibyra was the\r\nhead, mustering 30,000 infantry and 2000 cavalry. The iron found in\r\nthis district was easily cut with a chisel or other sharp tool. The\r\nsite of this powerful city has been ascertained to be at Horzoom, on\r\nthe Horzoom Tchy, a branch of the Dalamon Tchy or Indus. The ruins are\r\nvery extensive, and the theatre in fine preservation.\r\n\r\n[3933] Placed by Strabo west of Calynda. The ancient descriptions of\r\nits locality vary, but the place now known as Kaiguez is said to denote\r\nits site. The Caunii are frequently mentioned in the Persian, Grecian,\r\nand Roman histories. It was noted for its dried figs, mentioned by\r\nPliny in B. xv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[3934] Supposed by Mannert to be the Physcus of Strabo and the Phuscæ\r\nof Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[3935] Leake says that this harbour is now called Aplothíka by the\r\nGreeks, and Porto Cavaliere by the Italians, lie also says that on its\r\nwestern shore are the ruins of an Hellenic fortress and town, which are\r\nundoubtedly those of Loryma.\r\n\r\n[3936] It had a port of the same name.\r\n\r\n[3937] Called Pandion by Mela, according to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[3938] Parisot suggests that it is the same as Loryma previously\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[3939] Like the Gulf of Schœnus, a portion probably of the Dorian Gulf,\r\nnow the Gulf of Syme.\r\n\r\n[3940] The modern name of this promontory is not given by Hamilton, who\r\nsailed round it. It has been confounded with the Cynos Sema of Strabo,\r\nnow Capo Velo. The site of Hyda or Hyde is unknown.\r\n\r\n[3941] There was a town of this name as well. Stephen of Byzantium\r\ntells us that it received its name from a shepherd who saved the life\r\nof Podalirius, when shipwrecked on the coast of Caria.\r\n\r\n[3942] Part of it was situate on an island now called Cape Krio,\r\nconnected by a causeway with the mainland. Its site is covered with\r\nruins of a most interesting character in every direction. The Triopian\r\npromontory, evidently alluded to by Pliny, is the modern Cape Krio.\r\n\r\n[3943] It has been remarked that in his description here Pliny is very\r\nbrief and confused, and that he may intend to give the name of Triopia\r\neither to the small peninsula or island, or may include in this term\r\nthe western part of the whole of the larger peninsula.\r\n\r\n[3944] Of these _conventus_. For an account of Cibyra see last page.\r\n\r\n[3945] On the Lycus, now known as the Choruk-Su. By different writers\r\nit has been assigned to Lydia, Caria, and Phrygia, but in the ultimate\r\ndivision of the Roman provinces it was assigned to the Greater Phrygia.\r\nIt was founded by Antiochus II. on the site of a previous town, and\r\nnamed in honour of his wife Laodice. Its site is occupied by ruins\r\nof great magnificence. In the Apostolic age it was the seat of a\r\nflourishing Christian Church, which however very soon gave signs of\r\ndegeneracy, as we learn from St. John’s Epistle to it, Revel. ii.\r\n14-22. St. Paul also addresses it in common with the neighbouring\r\nchurch of Colossæ. Its site is now called Eski-Hissar, or the Old\r\nCastle.\r\n\r\n[3946] A tributary of the Phrygian Mæander.\r\n\r\n[3947] The people of Hydrela, a town of Caria, said to have been\r\nfounded by one of three brothers who emigrated from Sparta.\r\n\r\n[3948] The people of Themisonium, now called Tseni.\r\n\r\n[3949] The people of Hierapolis, a town of Phrygia, situate on a\r\nheight between the rivers Lycus and Mæander, about five miles north\r\nof Laodicea, on the road from Apamea to Sardis. It was celebrated for\r\nits warm springs, and its Plutonium, or cave of Pluto, from which\r\nissued a mephitic vapour of a poisonous nature; see B. ii. c. 95. The\r\nChristian Church here is alluded to by St. Paul in his Epistle to the\r\nColossians, iv. 13. Its ruins are situate at an uninhabited place\r\ncalled Pambuk-Kalessi.\r\n\r\n[3950] Situate in the north of Phrygia Salutaris; its ruins being\r\nprobably those to be seen at Afiour-Kara-Hisar. From the time of\r\nConstantine this place became the capital of Phrygia Salutaris. It\r\nstood in a fruitful plain, near a mountain quarry of the celebrated\r\nSynnadic marble, which was white with red veins and spots. This marble\r\nwas also called “Docimiticus,” from Docimia, a nearer place.\r\n\r\n[3951] As already mentioned in C. 25 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[3952] The site of Appia does not appear to be known. Cicero speaks\r\nof an application made to him by the Appiani, when he was governor of\r\nCilicia, respecting the taxes with which they were burdened, and the\r\nbuildings of their town.\r\n\r\n[3953] Eucarpia was a town of Phrygia, not far from the sources of the\r\nMæander, on the road from Dorylæum to Apamea Cibotus. The vine grew\r\nthere in great luxuriance, and to its fruitfulness the town probably\r\nowed its name. Kiepert places it in the vicinity of Segielar, but its\r\nexact site is unknown.\r\n\r\n[3954] The site of Dorylæum is now called Eski-Shehr. The hot-baths\r\nhere are mentioned by Athenæus, and its waters were pleasant to the\r\ntaste. Sheep-feeding appears to have been carried on here to a great\r\nextent, and under the Greek empire it was a flourishing place. The site\r\nof Midæum does not seem to be known.\r\n\r\n[3955] The people of Julia, Juliopolis, or Julianopolis, a town of\r\nLydia, probably to the south of Mount Tmolus.\r\n\r\n[3956] This place was built near Celænæ by Antiochus Soter, and named\r\nafter his mother Apama. Strabo says that it lay at the mouth of the\r\nriver Marsyas. Its site has been fixed at the modern Denair. Some\r\nancient ruins are to be seen.\r\n\r\n[3957] Pliny commits an error here; Celænæ was a different place from\r\nApamea, though close to it.\r\n\r\n[3958] Meaning the “Fountains of the Pipe,” and probably deriving\r\nits name from the legend here mentioned by Pliny, and in B. xvi. c.\r\n44. Strabo describes the Marsyas and Mæander as rising, according to\r\nreport, in one lake above Celænæ, which produced reeds adapted for\r\nmaking the mouth-pieces of musical instruments, but he gives no name\r\nto the lake. Hamilton found near Denair or Apamea, a lake nearly two\r\nmiles in circumference, full of reeds and rushes, which he looks upon\r\nas the lake on the mountain Aulocrene, described by Pliny in the 31st\r\nChapter of the present Book. His account however is very confused, as\r\nhe mentions on different occasions a _region_ of Aulocrene, a _valley_\r\nof Aulocrene, and a _mountain_ of Aulocrene.\r\n\r\n[3959] People of “the Mother City,” said by Stephen of Byzantium to\r\nhave received that name from Cybele, the _Mother_ of the Gods.\r\n\r\n[3960] Nothing is known of the site of Dionysopolis. It is mentioned in\r\na letter of Cicero’s to his brother Quintus, in which he speaks of the\r\npeople of this place as being very hostile to the latter.\r\n\r\n[3961] The site of Euphorbium is denoted, according to Leake, by the\r\nmodern Sandukli. It lay between Synnas and Apamea, and not improbably,\r\nlike Eucarpia, received its name from the fertility of its territory.\r\n\r\n[3962] The site of Acmona has been fixed at Ahatkoi, but it seems\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n[3963] The site of Pelta is by D’Anville called Ris-Chak or Hou-Chak.\r\n\r\n[3964] The people of Silbium or Silbia, near Metropolis.\r\n\r\n[3965] The Dorian settlements on the coast of Caria were so called. The\r\nDorian Gulf was probably the Sinus Ceramicus mentioned below.\r\n\r\n[3966] Of these places nothing whatever seems to be known.\r\n\r\n[3967] Pitaium and Eutane seem to be unknown.\r\n\r\n[3968] A member of the Dorian Hexapolis, or League of the Six Cities.\r\nThe site of this famous city is occupied by the modern Boodroum, and\r\nits ruins are very extensive. It was famous as being the birth-place of\r\nthe two historians Herodotus and Dionysius. It was the largest and best\r\nfortified city of Caria.\r\n\r\n[3969] According to Parisot the site of this place is now called Angeli\r\nand Karabaglas.\r\n\r\n[3970] This place must not be confounded with Telmessus or Telmissus in\r\nLycia, which has been previously mentioned. It was situate six miles\r\nfrom Halicarnassus. Of the other places here mentioned nothing seems to\r\nbe known.\r\n\r\n[3971] Now the Gulf of Staneo, Kos, or Boodroum. It took its name from\r\nthe port of Ceramus, now Keramo, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[3972] Now the Gulf of Mandeliyeh. It took its name from the city of\r\nIasus, the site of which is now called Askem or Asyn-Kalessi.\r\n\r\n[3973] Its ruins are to be seen at the port called Gumishlu. This was\r\na Dorian colony on the coast of Caria, founded probably on the site of\r\nthe old town of the Leleges.\r\n\r\n[3974] It has been suggested that this was only another name for the\r\nnew town of Myndos, in contradistinction to Palæomyndos, or “old\r\nMyndos.”\r\n\r\n[3975] Scylax the geographer is supposed to have been a native of this\r\nplace. The town is supposed to have been built partly on the mainland\r\nand partly on an island. Pastra Limani is supposed to have been the\r\nharbour of Caryanda.\r\n\r\n[3976] A Dorian city on the Promontory of Termerium.\r\n\r\n[3977] Situate near Iasus and Myndos. Leake conjectures that it may\r\nhave been on the bay between Pastra Limâne and Asyn Kalesi. There was\r\na statue here of Artemis Cindyas, under the bare sky, of which the\r\nincredible story was told that neither rain nor snow ever fell on it.\r\n\r\n[3978] See note [3972] on the last page.\r\n\r\n[3979] Its ruins are to be seen at the spot still called Melasso. It\r\nwas a very flourishing city, eight miles from the coast of the Gulf of\r\nIasus, and situate at the foot of a rock of fine white marble. It was\r\npartly destroyed in the Roman civil wars by Labienus. Its ruins are\r\nvery extensive.\r\n\r\n[3980] Hamilton has fixed the site of this place between four and\r\nfive miles south-east of Kuyuja, near the mouth of the valley of the\r\nKara-Su. The surrounding district was famous for the excellence of its\r\nfigs. The city was built by Antiochus, the son of Seleucus.\r\n\r\n[3981] Now called the Mendereh or Meinder.\r\n\r\n[3982] Pococke thinks that the present Jenjer is the Orsinus, while\r\nMannert takes it to be the Hadchizik, a little winding river that falls\r\ninto the Mæander.\r\n\r\n[3983] Now called Guzel-Hissar, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[3984] On the road from Dorylæum to Apamea. It is said to have received\r\nits name from Attalus II., who named the town after his brother and\r\npredecessor Eumenes II. Its site is known as Ishekle, and it is still\r\nmarked by numerous ruins and sculptures.\r\n\r\n[3985] A tributary of the Mæander. Its modern name is not mentioned.\r\n\r\n[3986] Mannert takes the ruins to be seen at Jegni-Chehr to be those\r\nof ancient Orthosia. The town of Lysias does not appear to have been\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\n[3987] The situation of this district is not known. See B. xvi. c. 16,\r\nwhere it appears that this region was famous for its boxwood.\r\n\r\n[3988] One of the numerous places of that name devoted to the worship\r\nof Bacchus. It was built on both sides of the ravine of the brook\r\nEudon, which fell into the Mæander. Its ruins are to be seen at\r\nSultan-Hissar, a little to the west of Hazeli.\r\n\r\n[3989] Its ruins are to be seen at Ghiuzel-Hissar, near Aidin. This was\r\na flourishing commercial city, included sometimes in Ionia, sometimes\r\nin Caria. It stood on the banks of the Eudon, a tributary of the river\r\nMæander. Under the Seleucidæ it was called Antiochia and Seleucia.\r\n\r\n[3990] From the beauty and fertility of the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n[3991] An Ionic town of Caria, on the north side of the Sinus Latmicus,\r\nfifty stadia from the mouth of the Mæander.\r\n\r\n[3992] Or Euromus, a town of Caria, at the foot of Mount Grion, which\r\nruns parallel with Latmos. Ruins of a temple to the north-west of\r\nAlabanda are considered to belong to Euromus.\r\n\r\n[3993] A town of uncertain site. It must not be confounded with the\r\nplace of the same name, mentioned in c. 31 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[3994] The ruins of its citadel and walls still exist on the east side\r\nof Mount Latmos, on the road from Bafi to Tchisme.\r\n\r\n[3995] Situate about twenty miles south of Tralles. The modern site is\r\ndoubtful, but Arab Hissa, on a branch of the Mæander, now called the\r\nTchina, is supposed to represent Alabanda. It was notorious for the\r\nluxuriousness of its inhabitants. A stone found in the vicinity was\r\nused for making glass and glazing vessels. See B. xxxvi. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[3996] Built by Antiochus I. Soter, and named, in honour of his wife,\r\nStratonice. It stood south of Alabanda, near the river Marsyas. It is\r\nsupposed that it stood on the site of a former city called Idrias, and\r\nstill earlier, Chrysaoris.\r\n\r\n[3997] D’Anville identifies it with a place called Keramo, but no such\r\nplace appears to be known. Strabo places it near the sea between Cnidus\r\nand Halicarnassus, and Ceramus comes next after Cnidus. Ptolemy seems\r\nto place it on the south side of the bay. Of Hynidos nothing appears to\r\nbe known.\r\n\r\n[3998] Its situation is unknown; but there can be little doubt that it\r\nwas founded by the Dorians who emigrated to the coast of Asia Minor\r\nfrom Argolis and Trœzene in the Peloponnesus. Phorontis appears to be\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n[3999] Parisot observes that many of the towns here mentioned belonged\r\nto the northern part of Phrygia.\r\n\r\n[4000] The people of Alinda in Caria, which was surrendered to\r\nAlexander the Great by Alinda, queen of Caria. It was one of the\r\nstrongest places in Caria. Its position has been fixed by Fellowes at\r\nDemmeergee-derasy, between Arab-Hissa and Karpuslee, on a steep rock.\r\n\r\n[4001] Of Xystis, as also of Hydissa, nothing appears to be known.\r\n\r\n[4002] Inhabitants of Apollonia in Caria, of which place nothing\r\nappears to be known.\r\n\r\n[4003] Pococke says that the modern site of Trapezopolis is called\r\nKaradche.\r\n\r\n[4004] The people of Aphrodisias, an ancient city of Caria, situate at\r\nthe modern Ghera or Geyra, south of Antiochia on the Mæander. Aphrodite\r\nor Venus seems to have been principally worshipped at this place.\r\nStrabo places it in Phrygia.\r\n\r\n[4005] Or Coscinia, a place in Caria, which, as we may gather from\r\nStrabo, ranked below a town. Leake thinks that Tshina, where Pococke\r\nfound considerable remains, is the site of this place.\r\n\r\n[4006] On the eastern bank of the Harpasus, a tributary of the Mæander.\r\nIts ruins are supposed to be those seen at a place called Harpas\r\nKalessi. In B. ii. c. 98, Pliny speaks of a wonderful rock at this\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n[4007] Now known as the Harpa.\r\n\r\n[4008] By this name alone it is known to Homer.\r\n\r\n[4009] Its ruins, now called Sart, are very extensive, though\r\npresenting nothing of importance. Its citadel, situated on a rock, was\r\nconsidered to be almost impregnable.\r\n\r\n[4010] Now called Kisilja Musa Dagh. It was famous for its wine,\r\nsaffron, and gold.\r\n\r\n[4011] Now called the Sarabat. It was famous for its gold-producing\r\nsands.\r\n\r\n[4012] On the road between Thyatira and Sardes: near it was situate the\r\nnecropolis of Sardes.\r\n\r\n[4013] Strabo says that some persons called the citadel only by that\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[4014] There was a city of Mysia or Phrygia of the name of Cadus or\r\nCadi; but nothing is known of the place here alluded to, whose people\r\nwould appear to have been a colony from Macedonia.\r\n\r\n[4015] The people of Philadelphia, now Ala-Cher, or the “Fine City,”\r\ntwelve leagues south-east of Sardes, and nine leagues south of Attalia.\r\n\r\n[4016] So called from the Greek Ἀπόλλωνος ἱερὸν, “the temple of\r\nApollo,” in the vicinity of which, south-east of Pergamus, their town\r\nwas probably situate. Nothing is known of these localities.\r\n\r\n[4017] Dwellers in Mesotmolus, a town which, from its name, would\r\nappear to have been situate on the middle of Mount Tmolus.\r\n\r\n[4018] Now called the Gulf of Melasso.\r\n\r\n[4019] Now the Cape of Melasso.\r\n\r\n[4020] The remains of the Temple of Didymæan Apollo at Branchidæ are\r\nstill visible to those sailing along the coast. It was in the Milesian\r\nterritory, and above the harbour Panormus. The name of the site was\r\nprobably Didyma or Didymi, but the place was also called Branchidæ,\r\nfrom that being the name of a body of priests who had the care of the\r\ntemple. We learn from Herodotus that Crœsus, king of Lydia, consulted\r\nthis oracle, and made rich presents to the temple. The temple, of which\r\nonly two columns are left, was of white marble.\r\n\r\n[4021] The ruins of this important city are difficult to discover on\r\naccount of the great changes made on the coast by the river Mæander.\r\nThey are usually supposed to be those at the poor village of Palatia on\r\nthe south bank of the Mendereh; but Forbiger has shown that these are\r\nmore probably the remains of Myus, and that those of Miletus are buried\r\nin a lake formed by the Mendereh at the foot of Mount Latmus.\r\n\r\n[4022] See B. vii. c. 57. Josephus says that he lived very shortly\r\nbefore the Persian invasion of Greece.\r\n\r\n[4023] Now called the Monte di Palatia.\r\n\r\n[4024] Generally called “Heraclea upon Latmus,” from its situation at\r\nthe western foot of Mount Latmus. Ruins of this town still exist at the\r\nfoot of that mountain on the borders of Lake Baffi.\r\n\r\n[4025] Its ruins are now to be seen at Palatia. It was the smallest\r\ncity of the Ionian Confederacy, and was situate at the mouth of the\r\nMæander, thirty stadia from its mouth.\r\n\r\n[4026] Mannert says that its ruins are to be seen at a spot called by\r\nthe Turks Sarasun-Kalesi.\r\n\r\n[4027] One of the twelve Ionian cities, situate at the foot of Mount\r\nMycale. It stood originally on the shore, but the change in the coast\r\nby the alluvial deposits of the Mæander left it some distance from the\r\nland. It was celebrated as being the birth-place of the philosopher\r\nBias. Its ruins are to be seen at the spot called Samsun.\r\n\r\n[4028] Now called Cape Santa Maria, or Samsun.\r\n\r\n[4029] He implies that it is derived from φυγὴ “flight.”\r\n\r\n[4030] Between Ephesus and Neapolis. It belonged to the Samians who\r\nexchanged with the Ephesians for Neapolis, which lay nearer to their\r\nisland. The modern Scala Nova occupies the site of one of them, it is\r\nuncertain which.\r\n\r\n[4031] Its ruins are to be seen at the modern Inek-Bazar. It was\r\nsituate on the river Lethæus, a tributary of the Mæander. It was famous\r\nfor its temple of Artemis Leucophryene, the ruins of which still exist.\r\n\r\n[4032] See B. ii. c. 91.\r\n\r\n[4033] Now known as Ak-Hissar or the “White Castle.” Strabo informs us\r\nthat it was founded by Seleucus Nicator.\r\n\r\n[4034] From the excellence of its horses.\r\n\r\n[4035] Its ruins are to be seen near the modern Ayazaluk. It was\r\nthe chief of the twelve Ionian cities on the coast of Asia Minor,\r\nand devoted to the worship of Artemis, whose temple here was deemed\r\none of the wonders of the world. Nothing, except some traces of its\r\nfoundations, is now to be seen of this stupendous building.\r\n\r\n[4036] It was more generally said to have been founded by the Carians\r\nand the Leleges.\r\n\r\n[4037] Now called the Kara-Su, or Black River, or Kuchuk-Meinder, or\r\nLittle Mæander.\r\n\r\n[4038] It has been observed that though Pliny seems to say that the\r\nCaÿster receives many streams, they must have had but a short course,\r\nand could only be so many channels by which the rivers descend from the\r\nmountain slopes that shut in the contracted basin of the river.\r\n\r\n[4039] This lake or marsh seems to be the morass situate on the road\r\nfrom Smyrna to Ephesus, into which the Phyrites flows, and out of which\r\nit comes a considerable stream.\r\n\r\n[4040] The Phyrites is a small river that is crossed on the road from\r\nEphesus to Smyrna, and joins the Caÿster on the right bank ten or\r\ntwelve miles above Ayazaluk, near the site of Ephesus.\r\n\r\n[4041] See B. ii. c. 91. for further mention of this island.\r\n\r\n[4042] Said to be derived from the Greek, meaning “The beautiful\r\n(stream) from Pion.”\r\n\r\n[4043] One of the twelve Ionian cities of Asia, founded by Andræmon.\r\nNotium was its port. There do not seem to be any remains of either of\r\nthese places.\r\n\r\n[4044] Called also the Hales or Ales, and noted for the coolness of its\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n[4045] At Clarus, near Colophon. When Germanicus was on his way to the\r\nEast, this oracle foretold to him his speedy death. Chandler is of\r\nopinion that he discovered the site of this place at Zillé, where he\r\nfound a spring of water with marble steps to it, which he considers to\r\nhave been the sacred fountain. Others again suggest that these ruins\r\nmay be those of Notium.\r\n\r\n[4046] Its site was probably near the modern Ekklesia, but no traces of\r\nthe city itself are to be found.\r\n\r\n[4047] Implying that in his time Notium was not in existence, whereas\r\nin reality Notium superseded Old Colophon, of which it was the port,\r\nand was sometimes known as New Colophon.\r\n\r\n[4048] Now known as Cape Curco.\r\n\r\n[4049] The site of this place is now known as Ritri, on the south side\r\nof a small peninsula, which projects into the bay of Erythræ. The ruins\r\nare considerable.\r\n\r\n[4050] On the south side of the bay of Smyrna. In Strabo’s time this\r\ncity appears to have been removed from Chytrium, its original site.\r\nChandler found traces of the city near Vourla, from which he came to\r\nthe conclusion that the place was very small and inconsiderable.\r\n\r\n[4051] According to Nicander, this was a mountain of the territory of\r\nClazomenæ, almost surrounded by sea.\r\n\r\n[4052] Or “the Horses,” originally four islands close to the mainland,\r\noff Clazomenæ.\r\n\r\n[4053] This was probably the same causeway that was observed by\r\nChandler in the neighbourhood of Vourla, the site of ancient Clazomenæ.\r\n\r\n[4054] See B. ii. c. 91, where he speaks of this place as being\r\nswallowed up in the earth.\r\n\r\n[4055] From Clazomenæ.\r\n\r\n[4056] Now called Izmir by the Turks, Smyrna by the western nations of\r\nEurope; the only one of the great cities on the western coast of Asia\r\nMinor that has survived to the present day. This place stood at the\r\nhead of the cities that claimed to be the birth-place of Homer; and\r\nthe poet was worshipped here for a hero or demi-god in a magnificent\r\nbuilding called the Homereum. There are but few remains of the ancient\r\ncity: the modern one is the greatest commercial city of the Levant.\r\n\r\n[4057] Hardouin takes this to be the name of a town, but Ortelius and\r\nPinetus seem to be more correct in thinking it to be the name of a\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\n[4058] It does not appear that all these mountains have been\r\nidentified. Cadmus is the Baba Dagh of the Turks.\r\n\r\n[4059] Mentioned in C. 29 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4060] In the time of Strabo this tributary of the Hermus seems to have\r\nbeen known as the Phrygius.\r\n\r\n[4061] Its site is now called Menemen, according to D’Anville. The\r\nCryus was so called from the Greek κρύος, “cold.”\r\n\r\n[4062] The present Gulf of Smyrna.\r\n\r\n[4063] Or the “Ants.”\r\n\r\n[4064] Probably so called from the whiteness of the promontory on\r\nwhich it was situate. It was built by Tachos, the Persian general, in\r\nB.C. 352, and remarkable as the scene of the battle between the Consul\r\nLicinius Crassus and Aristonicus in B.C. 131. The modern name of its\r\nsite is Lefke.\r\n\r\n[4065] Its ruins are to be seen at Karaja-Fokia or Old Fokia,\r\nsouth-west of Fouges or New Fokia. It was said to have been founded by\r\nPhocian colonists under Philogenes and Damon.\r\n\r\n[4066] The people of Hyrcania, one of the twelve cities which were\r\nprostrated by an earthquake in the reign of Tiberius Cæsar; see B. ii.\r\nc. 86.\r\n\r\n[4067] The people of Magnesia “ad Sipylum,” or the city of Magnesia on\r\nthe Sipylus. It was situate on the south bank of the Hermus, and is\r\nfamous in history as the scene of the victory gained by the two Scipios\r\nover Antiochus the Great, which secured to the Romans the empire of the\r\nEast, B.C. 190. This place also suffered from the great earthquake in\r\nthe reign of Tiberius, but was still a place of importance in the fifth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[4068] The people, it is supposed, of a place called Hierocæsarea.\r\n\r\n[4069] The people probably of Metropolis in Lydia, now Turbali, a\r\ncity on the plain of the Caÿster, between Ephesus and Smyrna. Cilbis,\r\nperhaps the present Durgut, was their chief place.\r\n\r\n[4070] A people dwelling in the upper valley of Caÿster.\r\n\r\n[4071] Or Mysian Macedonians.\r\n\r\n[4072] The people of Mastaura in Lydia. Its site is still known as\r\nMastaura-Kalesi.\r\n\r\n[4073] The people of Briula, the site of which is unknown.\r\n\r\n[4074] The people of Hypæpæ, a small town of Lydia, on the southern\r\nslope of Mount Tmolus, forty-two miles from Ephesus. Under the Persian\r\nsupremacy, the worship of Fire was introduced at this place. Arachne,\r\nthe spinner, and competitor with Minerva, is represented by Ovid as\r\ndwelling at this place; he calls it on two occasions “the _little_\r\nHypæpæ.” Leake is of opinion that the ruins seen at Bereki belong to\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\n[4075] The people of Dios Hieron, or the “Temple of Jupiter.” This\r\nwas a small place in Ionia between Lebedus and Colophon. It has been\r\nsuggested that it was on the banks of the Caÿster, but its site is\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\n[4076] Æolis, properly so called, extended as far north as the\r\npromontory of Lectum, at the northern entrance of the bay of\r\nAdramyttium.\r\n\r\n[4077] Near Cyme, a place of Pelasgian origin. It was called Egyptian\r\nLarissa, because Cyrus the Great settled here a body of his Egyptian\r\nsoldiers. According to D’Anville its site is still known as Larusar.\r\n\r\n[4078] Said to have been so called from Cyme an Amazon. It was on\r\nthe northern side of the Hermus: Herodotus gives it the surname of\r\nPhriconis. Its site is supposed to be at the modern Sanderli or\r\nSandarlio. The father of the poet Hesiod was a native of this place.\r\n\r\n[4079] It was probably so called in honour of the Emperor Augustus.\r\n\r\n[4080] Situate at a short distance from the coast. We learn from\r\nTacitus that it suffered from the great earthquake in the time of\r\nTiberius. Its site is called Guzel-Hissar, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[4081] Originally named Agroeira or Alloeira. There is a place still\r\ncalled _Adala_, on the river Hermus, but Hamilton found no remains of\r\nantiquity there.\r\n\r\n[4082] Or the “New Walls.” Strabo speaks of it as distant thirty stadia\r\nfrom Larissa.\r\n\r\n[4083] Its site is unknown; but it must not be confounded with the\r\nplace of that name mentioned in the last Chapter, which stood on the\r\nsea-coast. It suffered from the great earthquake in the reign of\r\nTiberius Cæsar.\r\n\r\n[4084] Or Grynium, forty stadia from Myrina, and seventy from Elæa. It\r\ncontained a sanctuary of Apollo with an ancient oracle and a splendid\r\ntemple of white marble. Parmenio, the general of Alexander, took the\r\nplace by assault and sold the inhabitants as slaves. It is again\r\nmentioned by Pliny in B. xxxii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[4085] This passage seems to be in a corrupt state, and it is difficult\r\nto arrive at Pliny’s exact meaning.\r\n\r\n[4086] The port of the Pergameni. Strabo places it south of the river\r\nCaïcus, twelve stadia from that river, and 120 from Pergamum. Its site\r\nis uncertain, but Leake fixes it at a place called Kliseli, on the road\r\nfrom the south to Pergamum.\r\n\r\n[4087] Its modern name is said to be Ak-Su or Bakir.\r\n\r\n[4088] On the coast of the Elaitic gulf. It was almost destroyed by\r\nan earthquake in the reign of the Emperor Titus. Its site is by some\r\nthought to have been at Sanderli.\r\n\r\n[4089] Supposed to have been situate near the modern Cape Coloni. It\r\nwas here that in the war with Antiochus, B.C. 191-190, the Roman fleet\r\nwas hauled up for the winter and protected by a ditch or rampart.\r\n\r\n[4090] So called from Lysimachus, the son of Agathocles.\r\n\r\n[4091] A strong place opposite to Lesbos. It was on the road from\r\nAdramyttium to the plain of the Caïcus. Its site is generally fixed at\r\nDikeli Koi.\r\n\r\n[4092] Or Carine. The army of Xerxes, on its route to the Hellespont,\r\nmarched through this place. Its site is unknown.\r\n\r\n[4093] It lay outside of the bay of Adramyttium and the promontory of\r\nPyrrha.\r\n\r\n[4094] Mentioned in the Iliad with Chryse and Tenedos.\r\n\r\n[4095] A place called Kutchulan, or, as some write it,\r\nCotschiolan-Kuni, is supposed to occupy its site.\r\n\r\n[4096] Or Thebes, in the vicinity of Troy.\r\n\r\n[4097] In the plain of Thebes between Antandros and Adramyttium. It had\r\na temple of Artemis, of which the Antandrii had the superintendence.\r\nIts site does not appear to have been ascertained.\r\n\r\n[4098] Not improbably the Chryse, mentioned by Homer in the Iliad, B.\r\ni. ll. 37, 390, 431; but there were several places of this name.\r\n\r\n[4099] See the note [4105] to Scepsis in the present Chapter.\r\n\r\n[4100] Or Gergis, Gergithus, or Gergithes, a town in the Troad, north\r\nof Scamander. It was a place with an acropolis and strong walls.\r\nAttalus, king of Pergamus, transplanted the people of Gergis to another\r\nspot near the sources of the Caïcus, whence we afterwards find a place\r\ncalled Gergetha or Gergithion, in the vicinity of Larissa. The old town\r\nof Gergis was by some said to have been the birth-place of the Sibyl,\r\nand its coins have her image impressed on them.\r\n\r\n[4101] Also called Neandria, upon the Hellespont.\r\n\r\n[4102] South of Adramyttium; in its vicinity were copper-mines and\r\ncelebrated vineyards. It was here that Thucydides is said to have died.\r\n\r\n[4103] In the district of Coryphantes, opposite to Lesbos, and north of\r\nAtarneus. Pliny speaks of the oysters of Coryphas, B. xxxii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[4104] This Aphrodisias does not appear to have been identified.\r\n\r\n[4105] Again mentioned by Pliny in B. xi. c. 80. Scepsis was an\r\nancient city in the interior of the Troad, south-east of Alexandria,\r\nin the mountains of Ida. Its inhabitants were removed by Antigonus to\r\nAlexandria; but being permitted by Lysimachus to return to their homes,\r\nthey built a new city, and the remains of the old town were then called\r\nPalæscepsis. This place is famous in literary history for being the\r\nspot where certain MSS. of Aristotle and Theophrastus were buried to\r\nprevent their transfer to Pergamus. When dug up they were found nearly\r\ndestroyed by mould, and in this condition were removed by Sylla to\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\n[4106] Sometimes called the Lycormas, now known as the Fidhari or\r\nFidharo.\r\n\r\n[4107] Frequently mentioned by Homer.\r\n\r\n[4108] Still known as Ida or Kas-Dagh.\r\n\r\n[4109] More generally known as Adramyttium or Adramyteum, now Adramiti\r\nor Edremit. According to tradition it was founded by Adramys, the\r\nbrother of Crœsus, king of Lydia. It is mentioned as a sea-port in the\r\nActs, xxvii. 2. There are no traces of ancient remains on its site.\r\n\r\n[4110] One of the heights of Mount Ida in the Troad, now called\r\nKaz-Dag. The territory in this vicinity, as we learn from Virgil and\r\nSeneca, was famous for its fertility. The modern village of Iné is\r\nsupposed to occupy the site of the ancient town of Gargara.\r\n\r\n[4111] Now Antandro, at the head of the Gulf of Adramyttium. Aristotle\r\nalso says that its former name was Edonis, and that it was inhabited by\r\na Thracian tribe of Edoni. Herodotus as well as Aristotle also speak of\r\nthe seizure of the place by the Cimmerii in their incursion into Asia.\r\n\r\n[4112] Now Cape Baba or Santa Maria, the south-west promontory of the\r\nTroad.\r\n\r\n[4113] Or Sminthian Apollo. This appears to have been situate at the\r\nChrysa last mentioned by Pliny as no longer in existence. Strabo places\r\nChrysa on a hill, and he mentions the temple of Smintheus and speaks of\r\na symbol which recorded the etymon of that name, the mouse which lay\r\nat the foot of the wooden figure, the work of Scopas. According to an\r\nancient tradition, Apollo had his name of Smintheus given him as being\r\nthe mouse-destroyer, for, according to Apion, the meaning of Smintheus\r\nwas a “mouse.”\r\n\r\n[4114] According to tradition this place was in early times the\r\nresidence of Cycnus, a Thracian prince, who possessed the adjoining\r\ncountry, and the island of Tenedos, opposite to which Colone was\r\nsituate on the mainland. Pliny however here places it in the interior.\r\n\r\n[4115] The site of this Apollonia is at Abullionte, on a lake of\r\nthe same name, the Apolloniatis of Strabo. Its remains are very\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\n[4116] Or Lycus, now known as the Edrenos.\r\n\r\n[4117] Of this people nothing whatever is known.\r\n\r\n[4118] D’Anville thinks that the modern Bali-Kesri occupies the site of\r\nMiletopolis.\r\n\r\n[4119] Stephanus Byzantinus mentions a place called Pœmaninum near\r\nCyzicus.\r\n\r\n[4120] The inhabitants of Polichna, a town of the Troad.\r\n\r\n[4121] The people of Pionia, near Scepsis and Gargara.\r\n\r\n[4122] They occupied the greater part of Mysia Proper. They had a\r\nnative divinity to which they paid peculiar honours, by the Greeks\r\ncalled Ζεὺς Ἀβρεττηνὸς.\r\n\r\n[4123] The same as the Olympeni or Olympieni, in the district of\r\nOlympene at the foot of Mount Olympus; next to whom, on the south and\r\nwest, were the Abretteni.\r\n\r\n[4124] On the south-western coast of the Troad, fifty stadia south of\r\nLarissa. In the time of Strabo it had ceased to exist. No ruins of\r\nthis place have been known to be discovered, but Prokesch is induced\r\nto think that the architectural remains to be seen near Cape Baba are\r\nthose of Hamaxitus.\r\n\r\n[4125] Or Cebrene or Cebren. It was separated from the territory of\r\nScepsis by the river Menander. Leake supposes it to have occupied the\r\nhigher region of Ida on the west, and that its site may have been at a\r\nplace called Kushunlu Tepe, not far from Baramitsh.\r\n\r\n[4126] Mentioned in Acts xvi. 8. It is now called Eski Stambul or\r\nOld Stambul. It was situate on the coast of Troas, opposite to the\r\nsouth-eastern point of the island of Tenedos, and north of Assus.\r\nIt was founded by Antigonus, under the name of Antigonia Troas, and\r\npeopled with settlers from Scepsis and other neighbouring towns. The\r\nruins of this city are very extensive.\r\n\r\n[4127] Or Nea, mentioned in B. ii. c. 97.\r\n\r\n[4128] Now called the Mendereh-Chai.\r\n\r\n[4129] On the north-west promontory of Troas. Here Homer places the\r\nGrecian fleet and camp during the Trojan war. The promontory is now\r\ncalled Yenisheri.\r\n\r\n[4130] Now called Jeni-Scher, according to Ansart. It was at this spot\r\nthat the Greeks landed in their expedition against Troy.\r\n\r\n[4131] Usually identified with the Mendereh-Chai or Scamander.\r\n\r\n[4132] The modern Gumbrek.\r\n\r\n[4133] Or “ancient Scamander.”\r\n\r\n[4134] Now known as the Koja-Chai; memorable as the scene of the three\r\ngreat victories by which Alexander the Great overthrew the Persian\r\nempire, B.C. 334. Here also a victory was gained by Lucullus over\r\nMithridates, B.C. 73.\r\n\r\n[4135] Or Sea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n[4136] It is not exactly known whether _New_ Ilium was built on the\r\nsame site as the Ilium or Troy which had been destroyed by the Greeks;\r\nbut it has been considered improbable that the exploits mentioned\r\nin the Iliad should have happened in so short a space as that lying\r\nbetween the later Ilium and the coast. The site of New Ilium is\r\ngenerally considered to be the spot covered with ruins, now called\r\nKissarlik, between the villages called Kum-kioi, Kalli-fath, and\r\nTchiblak.\r\n\r\n[4137] The Dictator Sylla showed especial favour to Ilium.\r\n\r\n[4138] Now called Cape Intepeh or Barbieri.\r\n\r\n[4139] The modern Paleo Castro probably occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[4140] More generally called Dardanus, or Dardanum, said to have been\r\nbuilt by Dardanus. It was situate about a mile south of the promontory\r\nDardanis or Dardanium. Its exact site does not appear to bo known: from\r\nit the modern Dardanelles are supposed to have derived their name.\r\n\r\n[4141] Situate between Percote and Abydus, and founded by Scamandrius\r\nand Ascanius the son of Æneas. The village of Moussa is supposed to\r\noccupy its site. The army of Alexander mustered here after crossing the\r\nHellespont.\r\n\r\n[4142] Alexander the Great visited this place on his Asiatic expedition\r\nin B.C. 334, and placed chaplets on the tomb of Achilles.\r\n\r\n[4143] So called from Æas, the Greek name of Ajax.\r\n\r\n[4144] Teuthrania was in the south-western comer of Mysia, between\r\nTemnus and the borders of Lydia, where in very early times Teuthras was\r\nsaid to have founded a Mysian kingdom, which was early subdued by the\r\nkings of Lydia: this part was also called Pergamene.\r\n\r\n[4145] Called Pionitæ in the preceding Chapter.\r\n\r\n[4146] A town in the Troad, the site of which is unknown.\r\n\r\n[4147] A town on the Propontis, according to Stephanus. The sites of\r\nmost of the places here mentioned are utterly unknown.\r\n\r\n[4148] Also called Pergama or Pergamus. Its ruins are to be seen at\r\nthe modern Pergamo or Bergamo. It was the capital of the kingdom of\r\nPergamus, and situate in the Teuthranian district of Mysia, on the\r\nnorthern bank of the river Caïcus. Under its kings, its library almost\r\nequalled that of Alexandria, and the formation of it gave rise to the\r\ninvention of parchment, as a writing material, which was thence called\r\n_Charta Pergamena_. This city was an early seat of Christianity, and is\r\none of the seven churches of Asia to whom the Apocalyptic Epistles are\r\naddressed. Its ruins are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[4149] At the beginning of the preceding Chapter.\r\n\r\n[4150] The people of Thyatira, mentioned in B. v. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[4151] The people of Mygdonia, a district between Mount Olympus and the\r\ncoast, in the east of Mysia and the west of Bithynia.\r\n\r\n[4152] “The people of the Holy Village.” Hierocome is mentioned by Livy\r\nas situate beyond the river Mæander.\r\n\r\n[4153] The people of Attalia, mentioned in C. 32.\r\n\r\n[4154] Previously mentioned in the present Chapter.\r\n\r\n[4155] Or “the Table.” Now known as Capo de Janisseri.\r\n\r\n[4156] Also called the Milyæ, probably of the Syro-Arabian race; they\r\nwere said to have been the earliest inhabitants of Lycia.\r\n\r\n[4157] The Leleges are now considered to have been a branch of the\r\ngreat Indo-Germanic race, who gradually became incorporated with the\r\nHellenic race, and thus ceased to exist as an independent people.\r\n\r\n[4158] A nation belonging probably more to mythology than history.\r\nStrabo supposes them to have been of Thracian origin, and that their\r\nfirst place of settlement was Mysia.\r\n\r\n[4159] By some supposed to have been a people of Phrygia.\r\n\r\n[4160] Mentioned in C. 29 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4161] From the Greek δαμάω, “to subdue.” Hardouin thinks that this\r\nappellation is intended to be given by Pliny to Asia in general, and\r\nnot to the city of Apamea in particular, as imagined by Ortelius and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[4162] It is so described by Homer.\r\n\r\n[4163] This was the light-house built upon it by Ptolemy II.\r\nPhiladelphus, whence the name of _pharus_ came to be applied to similar\r\nstructures. It was here also that, according to the common story, the\r\nseventy Translators of the Greek version of the Old Testament, hence\r\ncalled the Septuagint, were confined while completing their work.\r\n\r\n[4164] The _narrow_ or _fortified_ channel.\r\n\r\n[4165] The _Neptunian_ channel.\r\n\r\n[4166] Mentioned also in C. 14 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4167] In C. 17 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4168] The boatmen of Ruad, the ancient Aradus, still draw fresh water\r\nfrom the spring Ain Ibrahim, in the sea, a few rods from the shore of\r\nthe opposite coast.\r\n\r\n[4169] Now called Kibris.\r\n\r\n[4170] Strabo makes it 425. Hardouin remarks that Isidorus has not made\r\nallowance for the margin of the creeks and bays.\r\n\r\n[4171] The north-eastern extremity of Cyprus. It is now called Capo\r\nSant Andreas. It is more generally known in the editions of Pliny by\r\nthe name of Dinaretum.\r\n\r\n[4172] Now called Capo Sant Epifanio, or Pifano, after the celebrated\r\nmetropolitan of Cyprus. It is the western extremity of the island.\r\n\r\n[4173] From the Greek κέρας, “a horn.” It was not improbably so called\r\nfrom the numerous _horns_ or promontories on its coast.\r\n\r\n[4174] From the Greek μακάριος, “blessed,” in compliment to its fertile\r\nsoil and delightful temperature.\r\n\r\n[4175] Apparently from the Greek κρυπτὸς, “concealed.” Stephanus\r\nByzantinus says that it was so called because it was frequently hidden\r\nbeneath the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\n[4176] Or New Paphos. The spot is still called Bafa or Bafo.\r\n\r\n[4177] Or Old Paphos, now Kukala or Konuklia. Old Paphos was situate\r\nnear the promontory Zephyrium on the river Bocarno, where it had a good\r\nharbour; while New Paphos lay more inland, in the midst of a fertile\r\nplain, sixty stadia from the former. Old Paphos was the chief seat of\r\nworship of Aphrodite or Venus, who was said to have landed at that\r\nplace after her ascent from the sea.\r\n\r\n[4178] Situate on the most southerly point in the island; now Capo\r\nGavatta or delle Gatte.\r\n\r\n[4179] A town situate on the south coast of Cyprus. Its ruins are to be\r\nseen between Larnika and the port now known as Salines; they are very\r\nextensive. In B. xxx. c. 9, Pliny speaks of the salt lakes near this\r\nplace, which are worked at the present day.\r\n\r\n[4180] In the middle of the east coast. It was said to have been\r\nfounded by Teucer the son of Telamon, who gave it the name of his\r\nnative land from which he had been banished by his father.\r\n\r\n[4181] Now called Old Limasol, a town on the south coast, celebrated\r\nfor its worship of Aphrodite or Venus. It was a Phœnician settlement,\r\nand Stephanus calls it the most ancient city in the island. It long\r\npreserved its oriental customs, and here the Tyrian Hercules was\r\nworshipped under his name of Melkart.\r\n\r\n[4182] Its site is now called Lapitho or Lapta.\r\n\r\n[4183] Probably the same as the Temese of Homer. It was situate in a\r\nfertile district in the middle of Cyprus, and in the neighbourhood\r\nof extensive copper mines. Near it was a celebrated plain, sacred to\r\nVenus, mentioned by Ovid.\r\n\r\n[4184] Now called Chytria, a town of Cyprus on the road from Cerinea to\r\nSalamis.\r\n\r\n[4185] In the east of Cyprus, near the Promontory of Acamas, formerly\r\ncalled Marion. Ptolemy Soter destroyed this town, and removed the\r\ninhabitants to Paphos. The modern name of its site is Polikrusoko or\r\nCrisophou, from the gold mines in the neighbourhood. There was more\r\nthan one city of this name in Cyprus, which was probably bestowed on\r\nthem during its subjection to the princes of the line of Lagus. Another\r\nArsinoë is placed near Ammochostus to the north of the island, and a\r\nthird of the same name appears in Strabo with a harbour, temple and\r\ngrove, between Old and New Paphos.\r\n\r\n[4186] Or Carpasia, to the north-east of the island, facing the\r\nPromontory of Sarpedon on the Cilician coast. It was said to have\r\nbeen founded by Pygmalion, king of Tyre. Pococke speaks of remains at\r\nCarpas, the site of this place, especially a long wall and a pier.\r\n\r\n[4187] Or Golgos, famous for the worship of Aphrodite or Venus, which\r\nhad existed here even before its introduction at Paphos by Agapenor.\r\nIts position is unknown.\r\n\r\n[4188] Or Idalia, adjoining to which was a forest sacred to Aphrodite.\r\nThe poets, who connect this place with her worship, give us no\r\nindications whatever of its precise locality. Engel identifies it with\r\nthe modern Dalin, situate to the south of Leucosia, at the foot of\r\nMount Olympus.\r\n\r\n[4189] Now Cape Anamur.\r\n\r\n[4190] “Aulon Cilicium,” now the Sea of Caramania or Cyprus.\r\n\r\n[4191] The Cilician Sea, namely.\r\n\r\n[4192] There were several islands of this name. It is not improbable\r\nthat Pliny alludes to the one lying off the coast of Caria between\r\nthe isle of Rhodes and the mainland, and which seems to be the island\r\nmarked Alessa in the maps. There was another of the same name close to\r\nthe shore of Cilicia, afterwards known by the name of Sebaste.\r\n\r\n[4193] Or Cleides, meaning the “Keys.” This was a group of small\r\nislands lying to the north-east of Cyprus. The name of the islands was\r\nafterwards transferred by some geographer to the Cape which Pliny above\r\ncalls Dinæ, and others Dinaretum.\r\n\r\n[4194] Cape Acamas, now Pifano.\r\n\r\n[4195] Or the “Sacred Garden.” The names of this and the Salaminiæ do\r\nnot appear to be known to the modern geographers.\r\n\r\n[4196] This is identified by Beaufort with the islet called Bœshat,\r\nwhich is separated by a narrow channel from the Lycian shore. The\r\nothers do not seem to have been identified. Attelebussa is supposed to\r\ntake its name from a kind of destructive grasshopper without wings,\r\ncalled by the Greeks ἀττέλεβος.\r\n\r\n[4197] Situate off the commencement of the sea-coast of Pamphylia, on\r\nthe borders of Lycia. Beaufort speaks of them as five in number; he did\r\nnot meet with any of the dangers of the navigation here mentioned by\r\nPliny. The Greeks still call them Chelidoniæ, and the Italian sailors\r\nCelidoni, which the Turks have corrupted into Shelidan.\r\n\r\n[4198] Hardouin supposes these four islands to be the names of the\r\ngroup forming the Pactyæ. The names given appear to signify, the “Wild”\r\nor “Rough Islands,” the “Isle of the Nymphs,” the “Long Island,”\r\nand the “Greatest Island.” They were off the coast of Lycia, and\r\nseem to have belonged to the Rhodians. The modern name of Megista is\r\nKastelorizo, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[4199] Or Doliche, the “Long Island,” in the Lycian Sea, west of the\r\nruins of Myra. Its modern name is Kakava. It is now uninhabited.\r\n\r\n[4200] Still known as Grambousa, a small island off the east coast of\r\nLycia. There seems to have been another of the same name off the Lycian\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n[4201] An island off the coast of Lycia.\r\n\r\n[4202] Hardouin thinks that they were opposite to the city of Dædala on\r\nthe coast of Caria.\r\n\r\n[4203] Off the city of Crya, probably, in Caria.\r\n\r\n[4204] On the coast of Lycia.\r\n\r\n[4205] In Lycia. See C. 29 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4206] Probably so called from the number of hares found there.\r\n\r\n[4207] On the coast of Caria.\r\n\r\n[4208] Still known as Lindo and Camiro, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[4209] One of the three ancient Doric cities of Rhodes. It lay\r\nthree-quarters of a mile to the south-west of the city of Rhodes,\r\nwith which Pliny seems here to confound it. Its site is occupied by a\r\nvillage which still bears the name of Ialiso, and where a few ancient\r\nremains are to be found.\r\n\r\n[4210] From its productiveness of serpents.\r\n\r\n[4211] Either from Asterius, its former king, or from its being a\r\n“constellation” of the sea.\r\n\r\n[4212] Probably because of the clearness and serenity of its\r\natmosphere. See B. ii. c. 62.\r\n\r\n[4213] From its three-cornered shape.\r\n\r\n[4214] Perhaps so called from its fruitfulness in ivy, in Greek\r\nκορυμβήθρα, or else from κόρυμβος, “a summit,” from its elevated\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n[4215] From its verdant and grassy soil.\r\n\r\n[4216] Either from King Atabyrius, or the mountain Atabyrion; or else\r\nfrom the temple of Jupiter Tabyrius, which Appian speaks of as situate\r\nin this island.\r\n\r\n[4217] The “fortunate,” or “blessed” island.\r\n\r\n[4218] “Venomous,” or “deadly.” This name it most probably had in early\r\ntimes (and not more recently, as Pliny says), when it was covered with\r\ndense forests, the retreats of serpents and noxious reptiles.\r\n\r\n[4219] Now known as Skarpanto.\r\n\r\n[4220] Mentioned by Homer, Il. ii. 676. See also B. iv. c. 23 of the\r\npresent work. It is described by Ross as a single ridge of mountains,\r\nof considerable height.\r\n\r\n[4221] Signifying “sea-foam.”\r\n\r\n[4222] Still known as Nicero.\r\n\r\n[4223] From its production of the ‘murex,’ or ‘purple.’\r\n\r\n[4224] Now called Symi, a small island off the south-west coast of\r\nCaria, at the mouth of the Gulf of Doris, to the west of the Promontory\r\nof Cynossema.\r\n\r\n[4225] Now called the Island of St. Catherine, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[4226] Stephanus Byzantinus mentions these islands as lying in the\r\nvicinity at Syme. Perhaps they are the group lying to the south of it,\r\nnow called Siskle.\r\n\r\n[4227] Distant about fifty miles from Carpathus, or Skarpanto. It was\r\nprobably subject to Rhodes, in the vicinity of which it was situate.\r\nIts present name is Chalki.\r\n\r\n[4228] An island, according to Hardouin, not far from Halicarnassus, on\r\nthe coast of Ionia.\r\n\r\n[4229] So called from its productiveness of the νάρθηξ, or ferula.\r\n\r\n[4230] More probably Calydnæ, because there were several islands\r\nforming the group, of which Calymna was the chief. See B. iv. c. 23,\r\nwhere Pliny mentions only one town, that of Coös. There are some\r\nremains of the ancient towns still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[4231] A small island of Caria, south of Halicarnassus. It is now\r\ncalled Orak-Ada.\r\n\r\n[4232] Probably so called from the almost continual rains there.\r\n\r\n[4233] Now called Stanko, or Stanchio, a corruption of ἐς τὰν Κῶ.\r\n\r\n[4234] Which has been previously mentioned in this Chapter.\r\n\r\n[4235] In C. 29, Pliny has mentioned a Caryanda on the mainland. It\r\nis probable that there was a town on the mainland and another in the\r\nisland of the same name. Leake says, that there can be little doubt\r\nthat the large peninsula, towards the west end of which is the fine\r\nharbour called by the Turks Pasha Limani, is the ancient island of\r\nCaryanda, now joined to the mainland by a narrow sandy isthmus.\r\n\r\n[4236] The island of Hyali, near the harbour of Meffi, on the coast of\r\nCaria, according to Dupinet.\r\n\r\n[4237] Probably so called from the worship of the god Priapus there.\r\n\r\n[4238] Few, if any, of these islets can now be recognized. Sepiussa was\r\nprobably so called from the abundance of the sepia, or cuttle-fish,\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[4239] Over against the isle of Samos.\r\n\r\n[4240] B. iv. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[4241] Near the city of Miletus.\r\n\r\n[4242] So called from their resemblance to camels.\r\n\r\n[4243] Lying before the Promontory of Trogilium, mentioned in C. 31.\r\n\r\n[4244] Augustus gave their liberty to the Samians. The island is still\r\ncalled by the Greeks Samo, and by the Turks Susam Adassi.\r\n\r\n[4245] The “Virgin’s Island,” if so called after Juno, as some say; but\r\naccording to Strabo, it received its name from the river Parthenius.\r\n\r\n[4246] From its numerous oaks.\r\n\r\n[4247] From the abundance of its flowers.\r\n\r\n[4248] “Of dark,” or “black foliage;” in allusion probably to its\r\ncypresses.\r\n\r\n[4249] “Cypress-bearing.”\r\n\r\n[4250] This is not improbably a compound, formed by a mistake of\r\nthe copyists, of the two names, Parthenia and Aryusa, mentioned by\r\nHeraclides.\r\n\r\n[4251] “The Crown.” This island was the birth-place of Pythagoras.\r\n\r\n[4252] Now known as Khio, Scio, Saka Adassi, or Saksadasi. Chios was\r\ndeclared free by the Dictator Sulla.\r\n\r\n[4253] Χιὼν, gen. Χιόνος.\r\n\r\n[4254] Macris, from its length, and Pityusa, from its pine-trees.\r\n\r\n[4255] Dalechamps says 112 is the correct measurement.\r\n\r\n[4256] Mentioned in C. 31 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4257] Meaning “green and flourishing.”\r\n\r\n[4258] “Productive of laurels.” None of these islets appear to have\r\nbeen recognized by their modern names.\r\n\r\n[4259] By Strabo called Pordoselene. He says that the islands in its\r\nvicinity were forty in number; of which Pliny here gives the names of\r\ntwo-and-twenty.\r\n\r\n[4260] South of Proconnesus; now called Aloni.\r\n\r\n[4261] Near the city of Clazomenæ. It is now called Vourla, according\r\nto Ansart.\r\n\r\n[4262] Now Koutali, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[4263] We learn from Strabo and other writers, that this city was on\r\na peninsula, and that it stood on the southern side of the isthmus,\r\nconnecting Mount Mimas with the mainland of Lydia. It was the\r\nbirth-place of Anacreon and Hecatæus.\r\n\r\n[4264] Or the “Dove Islands;” probably from the multitude of those\r\nbirds found on those islands.\r\n\r\n[4265] Now called Antigona, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[4266] Now Mitylene, or Metelin.\r\n\r\n[4267] We find it also stated by Herodotus, that this island was\r\ndestroyed by the Methymnæans. The cities of Mitylene, Methymna, Eresus,\r\nPyrrha, Antissa, and Arisbe, originally formed the Æolian Hexapolis, or\r\nConfederation of Six Cities.\r\n\r\n[4268] The ruins found by Pococke at Calas Limneonas, north-east of\r\nCape Sigri, may be those of Antissa. This place was the birth-place of\r\nTerpander, the inventor of the seven-stringed lyre.\r\n\r\n[4269] Or Eressus, according to Strabo. It stood on a hill, reaching\r\ndown to the sea. Its ruins are said to be near a place still called\r\nEresso. It was the birth-place of the philosopher Theophrastus, the\r\ndisciple of Aristotle.\r\n\r\n[4270] Still called Mitylene, or Metelin.\r\n\r\n[4271] Strabo makes it about only 137 miles.\r\n\r\n[4272] Or the White Islands.\r\n\r\n[4273] So called from its fruitfulness in quinces, or “_Mala Cydonia_.”\r\n\r\n[4274] These were three small islands, near the mainland of Æolis. It\r\nwas off these islands that the ten generals of the Athenians gained a\r\nvictory over the Spartans, B.C. 406. The modern name of these islands\r\nis said to be Janot.\r\n\r\n[4275] One of the Leucæ, previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n[4276] So called from the φελλὸς, or “cork,” which it produced.\r\n\r\n[4277] Still known as Tenedos, near the mouth of the Hellespont. Here\r\nthe Greeks were said to have concealed their fleet, to induce the\r\nTrojans to think that they had departed, and then introduce the wooden\r\nhorse within their walls.\r\n\r\n[4278] “Having white eye-brows;” probably from the whiteness of its\r\ncliffs.\r\n\r\n[4279] In C. 33 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4280] Opposite to Sestos, made famous by the loves of Hero and\r\nLeander. Aidos, or Avido, a village on the Hellespont, is thought to\r\noccupy its site.\r\n\r\n[4281] Now called Bergase, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[4282] Its ruins are still known as Lapsaki. This important city was\r\ncelebrated for its wine, and was the chief seat of the worship of the\r\ngod Priapus.\r\n\r\n[4283] Its site is now called Camanar, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[4284] According to Ansart, the modern Caraboa marks its site.\r\n\r\n[4285] Now called the Satal-dere, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[4286] Its locality was not far from the modern Biga, according to\r\nAnsart.\r\n\r\n[4287] Now the Sea of Marmora.\r\n\r\n[4288] Mentioned in C. 33 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4289] Now called Artaki, or Erdek, a town of Mysia, and a Milesian\r\ncolony. A poor town now occupies its site.\r\n\r\n[4290] Its ruins are called by the Turks Bal Kiz, probably meaning “Old\r\nCyzicus.” There are many subterraneous passages, and the ruins are of\r\nconsiderable extent. Its temples and storehouses appear to have been\r\nbuilt on a scale of great magnificence. See Pliny, B. xxxvi. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[4291] The “Island of the Bears,” which animals frequented the mountain\r\nin its vicinity.\r\n\r\n[4292] Called Dindymum by Herodotus; probably the modern Morad Dagh, in\r\nwhich the river Hermus rises.\r\n\r\n[4293] Now called Saki, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[4294] Now called the Lartacho, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[4295] Previously mentioned in C. 32 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4296] In its limited sense; considered as a portion only of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[4297] On the west it bordered on Mysia, and on the south on Phrygia\r\nand Galatia, while the eastern boundary seems to have been less\r\ndefinite.\r\n\r\n[4298] Ephorus, as quoted by Stephanus Byzantinus, says, that the\r\nHalizones inhabited the district lying between Caria, Mysia, and Lydia.\r\nHesychius incorrectly places them in Paphlagonia.\r\n\r\n[4299] Meaning the “Village of Gordius,” one of its ancient kings. It\r\nwas also called Gordium. After falling to decay, it was rebuilt by\r\nAugustus, and called Juliopolis. It is celebrated in history as the\r\nplace where Alexander the Great cut the Gordian knot; the scene of the\r\nadventure being the Acropolis of the town, the former palace of King\r\nGordius.\r\n\r\n[4300] There were several Asiatic cities of the similar name of\r\nDascylium. The site of the one here mentioned does not appear to have\r\nbeen ascertained.\r\n\r\n[4301] More generally read “Gebes.”\r\n\r\n[4302] The “Bull’s Bed,” or “Den.” It probably took its second name\r\nfrom the Roman general Germanicus.\r\n\r\n[4303] Now called Medania, or Mutania. It received its name of Apamea\r\nfrom Prusias, king of Bithynia, in compliment to his wife. In the time\r\nof the first Cæsars, it was made a Roman colony.\r\n\r\n[4304] The Bay of Cios. The river runs into a lake, formerly known as\r\nLake Ascanius; probably that mentioned by Pliny in B. xxxi. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[4305] Stephanus Byzantinus says that it was the same as the town of\r\nCios, or Cius, here mentioned as near to it. It was on the shores of\r\nthe Propontis.\r\n\r\n[4306] Cape Baba, or Santa Maria; the south-western promontory of the\r\nTroad.\r\n\r\n[4307] In Phrygia Epictetus, or “Conquered Phrygia,” so called from its\r\nconquest by certain of the kings of Bithynia. Strabo calls this place a\r\n“small city, or hill-fortress, towards Lydia.” It was probably situate\r\nnear the source of the Macestus, now the Susugherli Su, or the Simaul\r\nSu, as it is called in its upper course.\r\n\r\n[4308] The place from which the citizens were removed to Apamea, as\r\nmentioned in C. 29 of the present Book. Hamilton (Researches, &c., p.\r\n499) supposes its acropolis to have been situate about half a mile from\r\nthe sources of the river Marsyas.\r\n\r\n[4309] First mentioned by Herodotus, and situate on the Lycus, a\r\nbranch of the Mæander. It had greatly declined in Strabo’s time, and\r\nin the middle ages there rose near it a town of the name of Chonæ, and\r\nColossæ disappeared. Hamilton found extensive ruins of an ancient city\r\nabout three miles north of the modern Khonos. It was one of the early\r\nChristian churches of Asia, and the Apostle Paul addressed one of his\r\nEpistles to the people of this place. It does not appear from it that\r\nhe had ever visited the place; indeed, from Chap. ii. 1 we may conclude\r\nthat he had not.\r\n\r\n[4310] This does not appear to be the same as the Carine mentioned in\r\nC. 32 of this Book, as having gone to decay. Its site is unknown.\r\n\r\n[4311] Or Cotiæum, or Cotyæum. It was on the Roman road from Dorylæum\r\nto Philadelphia, and in Phrygia Epictetus, according to Strabo. The\r\nmodern Kutahiyah is supposed to denote its site; but there are no\r\nremains of antiquity.\r\n\r\n[4312] It was bounded on the west, south, and south-east by those\r\ncountries; and on the north-east, north, and north-west by Pontus,\r\nPaphlagonia, and Bithynia.\r\n\r\n[4313] Mentioned in C. 40, under the name of Gordiucome.\r\n\r\n[4314] Who invaded and settled in Asia Minor, at various periods during\r\nthe third century B.C.\r\n\r\n[4315] Near a small stream, which seems to enter the Sangarius. It\r\noriginally belonged to Phrygia, and its mythical founder was Midas, the\r\nson of Gordius, who was said to have found an anchor on the spot, and\r\naccordingly given the name to the town; which story would, however,\r\nas it has been observed, imply that the name for anchor (ἄγκυρα)\r\nwas the same in the Greek and the Phrygian languages. The Tectosages,\r\nwho settled here about B.C. 277, are supposed to have been from the\r\nneighbourhood of Toulouse. It is now called Angora, or Engareh; and\r\nthe fine hair of the Angora goat may have formed one of the staple\r\ncommodities of the place, which had a very considerable trade. The\r\nchief monument of antiquity here is the marble temple of the Emperor\r\nAugustus, built in his honour during his lifetime. In the inside is the\r\nLatin inscription known as the _monumentum_, or _marmor Ancyranum_,\r\ncontaining a record of the memorable actions of Augustus. The ruins\r\nhere are otherwise interesting in a high degree.\r\n\r\n[4316] Now Tchoroum, according to Ansart.\r\n\r\n[4317] Its ruins are called Bala-Hisar, in the south-west of Galatia,\r\non the southern slope of Mount Didymus. This place was celebrated as a\r\nchief seat of the worship of the goddess Cybele, under the surname of\r\nAgdistis, whose temple, filled with riches, stood on a hill outside of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n[4318] Hardouin suggests that these are the Chomenses, the people of\r\nthe city of Choma, in the interior of Lycia, mentioned in C. 28 of the\r\npresent Book.\r\n\r\n[4319] The people of Lystra, a city of Lycaonia, on the confines of\r\nIsauria, celebrated as one of the chief scenes of the preaching of Paul\r\nand Barnabas. See Acts xiv.\r\n\r\n[4320] The people of Seleucia, in Pisidia.\r\n\r\n[4321] The people of Sebaste, a town of the Tectosages.\r\n\r\n[4322] The people of Timonium, a town of Paphlagonia, according to\r\nStephanus Byzantinus.\r\n\r\n[4323] Thebasa, a town of Lycaonia, has been mentioned in C. 25 of the\r\npresent Book.\r\n\r\n[4324] See C. 25 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4325] The town of Oroanda, giving name to this district, is mentioned\r\nat the end of C. 24 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4326] The Caÿster, the Rhyndacus, and the Cios.\r\n\r\n[4327] Now called the Sakariyeh, the largest river of Asia Minor after\r\nthe ancient Halys.\r\n\r\n[4328] Now called the Lefke, which discharges itself into the\r\nTangarius, or Sakariyeh.\r\n\r\n[4329] Called “Galli.” They were said to become mad from drinking of\r\nthe waters of this river, and to mutilate themselves when in a frantic\r\nstate. See Ovid’s Fasti, B. iv. l. 364 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[4330] Now called Brusa. It stood on the north side of Mount Olympus,\r\nfifteen Roman miles from Cius. According to most accounts, it was\r\nbuilt by Prusias, king of Bithynia. It is most probable that Hannibal\r\nsuperintended the works, while staying as a refugee at the court of\r\nPrusias.\r\n\r\n[4331] Now Lake Iznik.\r\n\r\n[4332] Its ruins are to be seen at Iznik, on the east side of the lake\r\nof that name. Its site is supposed to have been originally occupied by\r\nthe town of Attæa, and afterwards by a settlement of the Bottiæans,\r\ncalled Ancore, or Helicore, which was destroyed by the Mysians. On this\r\nspot, shortly after the death of Alexander the Great, Antigonus built\r\na city which he named after himself, Antigonæa; but Lysimachus soon\r\nafterwards changed the name into Nicæa, in honour of his wife. Under\r\nthe kings of Bithynia, it was often the royal residence, and it long\r\ndisputed with Nicomedia the rank of capital of Bithynia. The modern\r\nIznik is only a poor village, with about 100 houses. Considerable ruins\r\nof the ancient city are still in existence. Littré seems to think that\r\nthere are two Nicæas meant in these passages; but it would seem that\r\nthe same place is alluded to in both lines. The only thing that seems\r\nto give countenance to Littré’s supposition (in which he is supported\r\nby Hardouin) is, the expression “Et Prusa _item_ altera.”\r\n\r\n[4333] It has been suggested, that this is only another name for the\r\ntown of Cios, previously mentioned; but it is most probable that they\r\nwere distinct places, and that this was originally called Cierus,\r\nand belonged to the territory of Heraclea, but was conquered by King\r\nPrusias, who named it after himself. It stood to the north-west of the\r\nother Prusa.\r\n\r\n[4334] Or the “Golden Stream.”\r\n\r\n[4335] Suggested by Parisot to be the modern Cape Fagma.\r\n\r\n[4336] From the Greek κράσπεδον, a “skirt.”\r\n\r\n[4337] Or Astacus, a colony originally from Megara and Athens. From\r\nScylax it would appear that this city was also called Olbia. Its site\r\nis placed by some of the modern geographers at a spot called Ovaschik,\r\nand also Bashkele.\r\n\r\n[4338] Called Gebiseh, according to Busbequis,—at least in his day. The\r\nmodern Hereket, on the coast, has been suggested.\r\n\r\n[4339] Its ruins now bear the name of Izmid, or Iznikmid, at the\r\nnorth-eastern corner of the Sinus Astacenus, or Gulf of Izmid. It was\r\nthe chief residence of the kings of Bithynia, and one of the most\r\nsplendid cities in the world. Under the Romans it was made a colony,\r\nand was a favourite residence of Diocletian and Constantine the Great.\r\nArrian the historian was born here.\r\n\r\n[4340] Now Akrita. It is also called Akritas by Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[4341] The Straits, or Channel of Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[4342] Its site is supposed to have been about two miles south of\r\nthe modern Scutari, and it is said that the modern Greeks call it\r\nChalkedon, and the Turks Kadi-Kioi. Its destruction was completed by\r\nthe Turks, who used its materials for the construction of the mosques\r\nand other buildings of Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[4343] So called, Hardouin thinks, from its being opposite to the\r\nGolden Horn, or promontory on which Byzantium was built.\r\n\r\n[4344] Or Myrlea, mentioned above in C. 40. See p. 490.\r\n\r\n[4345] Or Bithynium, lying above Tius. Its vicinity was a good feeding\r\ncountry for cattle, and noted for the excellence of its cheese, as\r\nmentioned by Pliny, B. xi. c. 42. Antinoüs, the favourite of the\r\nEmperor Adrian, was born here, as Pausanias informs us. Its site does\r\nnot appear to be known.\r\n\r\n[4346] These rivers do not appear to have been identified by the modern\r\ngeographers.\r\n\r\n[4347] The modern Scutari occupies its site. Dionysius of Byzantium\r\nstates, that it was called Chrysopolis, either because the Persians\r\nmade it the place of deposit for the gold which they levied from the\r\ncities, or else from Chryses, a son of Agamemnon and Chryseis.\r\n\r\n[4348] A king of the Bebrycians. For some further particulars relative\r\nto this place, see B. xvi. c. 89 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4349] Situate on a promontory, which is represented by the modern\r\nAlgiro, according to Hardouin and Parisot.\r\n\r\n[4350] Other writers say that it was erected in honour of the Twelve\r\nGreater Divinities.\r\n\r\n[4351] Called Phinopolis in most of the editions. It is very doubtful\r\nwhether this passage ought not to be translated, “At a distance thence\r\nof eight miles and three-quarters is the first entrance to this strait,\r\nat the spot,” &c. We have, however, adopted the rendering of Holland,\r\nAjasson, and Littré.\r\n\r\n[4352] Mentioned in C. 28 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[4353] In B. iv. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[4354] Or “Deer Island.”\r\n\r\n[4355] Now Afzia, according to D’Anville.\r\n\r\n[4356] There is still an island in the Sea of Marmora known by the\r\nname Alon, which is separated from the north-western extremity of the\r\nPeninsula of Cyzicus by a narrow channel.\r\n\r\n[4357] Hesychius says, that there were two islands near Byzantium\r\ncalled by the common name of Demonnesi, but severally having the names\r\nof Chalcitis and Pityusa. Pliny, on the other hand, places Demonnesus\r\nopposite to Nicomedia, and at the same time mentions Chalcitis and\r\nPityodes (probably the same as Pityusa) as distinct places. D’Anville\r\ncalls Demonnesus “The Isle of Princes.”\r\n\r\n[4358] The position assigned to this island by Pliny and Strabo\r\ncorresponds with that of Kalolimno, a small island ten miles north of\r\nthe mouth of the Rhyndacus.\r\n\r\n[4359] Now called Prota, according to Parisot.\r\n\r\n[4360] So called from its copper-mines; now called Khalki, or Karki.\r\n\r\n[4361] Now called Prinkipo, east of Khalki.\r\n\r\n[4362] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4363] A celebrated Roman general, who was successively governor\r\nof Numidia and Britain, where he defeated Queen Boadicea. He was a\r\nsupporter of the Emperor Otho, but afterwards obtained a pardon from\r\nVitellius on the plea that he had betrayed Otho at the battle of\r\nBedriacum, and so contributed to his defeat; which, however, was not\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n[4364] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4365] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4366] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4367] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4368] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4369] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4370] Brother of Cæsonia, the wife of Caligula, and father of Domitia\r\nLongina, the wife of Domitian. He was the greatest general of his day,\r\nand conquered Tiridates, the powerful king of Parthia. He slew himself\r\nat Cenchreæ, A.D. 67, upon hearing that Nero had given orders for his\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n[4371] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4372] The Roman emperor, grandson of Livia, the wife of Augustus. As\r\nan author, the character in which he is here referred to, he occupied\r\nhimself chiefly with history, and was encouraged in the pursuit by\r\nLivy the historian. At an early age he began to write a history from\r\nthe death of the Dictator Cæsar, a plan which he afterwards abandoned,\r\nand began his work with the restoration of peace, after the battle of\r\nActium. Of the earlier period he had written only four books, but the\r\nlatter work he extended to forty-four. He also wrote memoirs of his own\r\nlife, which Suetonius describes as written with more silliness than\r\ninelegance. A fourth work was a defence of Cicero against the attacks\r\nof Asinius Pollio. He also wrote histories of Carthage and of Etruria\r\nin Greek. All of his literary works have perished.\r\n\r\n[4373] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4374] Nothing whatever is known of this son of T. Livius, the\r\ngreat Roman historian. It is not improbable that the transcribers\r\nhave committed an error in inserting the word _filio_, and that the\r\nhistorian himself is the person meant.\r\n\r\n[4375] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4376] “Acta Triumphorum” probably mean the registers kept in the\r\nCapitol, in which were inscribed the names of those who were honoured\r\nwith triumphs, and the decrees of the senate or the people in their\r\nfavour. This register must not be confounded with the “Tabulæ\r\nConsulares.”\r\n\r\n[4377] Juba II., king of Mauritania. After the defeat of his father at\r\nThapsus, he was carried a prisoner to Rome, though quite a child, and\r\ncompelled to grace the conqueror’s triumph. Augustus Cæsar afterwards\r\nrestored to him his kingdom, and gave him in marriage Cleopatra, or\r\nSelene, the daughter of Antony and Cleopatra. To his literary pursuits\r\nhe is chiefly indebted for his reputation. His works are continually\r\nquoted by Pliny, who regards his authority with the utmost deference.\r\nAmong his numerous works he seems to have written a History of Africa,\r\nAssyria, Arabia, and Rome; as also Treatises on the Stage, Music,\r\nGrammar, and Painting.\r\n\r\n[4378] Of Miletus. See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4379] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4380] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4381] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4382] He was employed by Alexander the Great in measuring distances in\r\nhis marches. He wrote a work upon this subject, entitled, “Distances of\r\nthe Marches of Alexander.”\r\n\r\n[4383] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4384] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4385] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4386] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4387] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4388] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4389] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4390] Of Chalcis. See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4391] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4392] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4393] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4394] Of Rhodes, the friend of P. Scipio Æmilianus and Lælius. He was\r\nthe head of the Stoic School at Athens, where he died. His principal\r\nwork was a Treatise on Moral Duties, which served as a model for Cicero\r\nin the composition of his work, “De Officiis.” He also wrote a work on\r\nthe philosophical sects.\r\n\r\n[4395] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4396] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4397] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4398] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4399] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4400] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4401] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4402] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4403] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4404] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4405] There are four literary persons mentioned of this name. 1. An\r\nAthenian comic poet of the middle comedy. 2. A native of Maronæa, in\r\nThrace, or else of Crete, who wrote lascivious and abusive verses,\r\nand was at last put to death by order of Ptolemy Philadelphus. He was\r\nthe inventor of the Sotadean verse, or Ionic a Majore, Tetrameter\r\nBrachycatalectic. 3. An Athenian philosopher, who wrote a book on\r\nmysteries. 4. A Byzantine philosopher, of whom nothing whatever is\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n[4406] There were two writers of this name, before the time of Pliny.\r\n1. Periander of Corinth, one of the Seven Wise Men, who wrote a\r\ndidactic poem, containing moral and political precepts, in 2000 lines;\r\nand, 2. a physician and bad poet, contemporary with Archidamas, the son\r\nof Agesilaüs. It is uncertain to which Pliny here refers.\r\n\r\n[4407] Probably a writer on geography. Nothing appears to be known of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[4408] Of Cyzicus, see end of B. ii.; of Cnidos, see end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4409] A Greek historian, who appears, from Plutarch, to have written a\r\nhistory of the expeditions of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n[4410] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4411] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4412] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4413] The author of the Periplus, or voyage which he performed round\r\na part of Libya, of which we have a Greek translation from the Punic\r\noriginal. His age is not known, but Pliny states (B. ii. c. 67, and B.\r\nv. c. 1) that the voyage was undertaken in the most flourishing days of\r\nCarthage. It has been considered on the whole, that he may be probably\r\nidentified with Hanno, the son or the father of Hamilcar, who was slain\r\nat Himera, B.C. 480.\r\n\r\n[4414] Mentioned also by Pliny, B. ii. c. 67, as having conducted a\r\nvoyage of discovery from Gades towards the north, along the western\r\nshores of Europe, at the same time that Hanno proceeded on his voyage\r\nalong the western coast of Africa. He is repeatedly quoted by Festus\r\nAvienus, in his geographical poem called _Ora Maritima_. His voyage is\r\nsaid to have lasted four months, but it is impossible to judge how far\r\nit extended.\r\n\r\n[4415] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4416] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[4417] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4418] A Greek geographer, and friend of Seleucus Nicator, by whom\r\nhe was sent on an embassy to Sandrocottus, king of the Prasii, whoso\r\ncapital was Palibothra, a town probably in the vicinity of the present\r\nPatna. Whether he had accompanied Alexander on his invasion of India is\r\nquite uncertain. He wrote a work on India in four books, to which the\r\nsubsequent Greek writers were chiefly indebted for their accounts of\r\nIndia. Arrian speaks highly of him as a writer, but Strabo impeaches\r\nhis veracity; and we find Pliny hinting the same in B. vi. c. 21. Of\r\nhis work only a few fragments survive.\r\n\r\n[4419] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[4420] See end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[4421] There was a philosopher of this name, a nephew of Chrysippus,\r\nand his pupil; but it is not known whether he is the person referred\r\nto, in C. 10, either as having written a work on universal geography,\r\nor on that of Egypt.",
