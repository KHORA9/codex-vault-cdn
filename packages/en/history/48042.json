Its most\r\ntypical representative, Metternich, a pupil of Talleyrand, a less\r\nadroit but far more mischievous man than his master, hoped to extend\r\nit to the whole of Europe. Everything that had been shaken, loosened,\r\nor overturned by the Revolution or by Napoleon was to be repaired and\r\nre-established. In the struggle with the great enemy they had been\r\nobliged at last to resort to every possible method, had been forced\r\nto appeal to the people instead of simply commanding, to appeal to\r\ntheir sentiment in place of their allegiance, and even to promise a\r\nthing as contrary to all cabinet policy, as youthfully revolutionary,\r\nas \"the regeneration of Germany.\" There had been, it is true, a very\r\nnoticeable difference between the Austrian and the Prussian watchwords.\r\n\"Justice and Order,\" \"Order and Peace,\" were the cues of the Austrian\r\nproclamations; those of the Prussian were \"The Nation,\" \"Freedom and\r\nHonour,\" \"Germany.\" Still both of the great German States had made more\r\nconcessions to the spirit of the times than at all suited the ideas of\r\ntheir leading statesmen. And no sooner was the enemy driven off, the\r\nheir of the Revolution crippled, and \"the war of freedom\" ended, than\r\nit became their object to put an end to the freedom as they had put an\r\nend to the war.\r\n\r\nThe generation that had grown up during the war with France had\r\nexpected to see a united Germany arise as the result of victory. As\r\nfar back as 1812, Stein had sketched a plan for the reunion of the\r\nscattered parts of the former German Empire, and Arndt and Görres had\r\ngiven expression to the same idea. But the Peace of Paris, in 1814,\r\ndecreed: \"The German States shall be independent, and united by a\r\nfederative league;\" and herewith all hopes of unification were dashed\r\nto the ground. Almost a generation passed before the people were again\r\nanimated by the thought. In place of the unified State arose the German\r\nConfederacy, _der deutsche Bund_, or, as Jahn called it, _Bunt_, a\r\nmany-coloured harlequin's garb for the nation; and the disappointment\r\nwas a bitter one.\r\n\r\nThe dream of freedom shared the fate of the dream of unification. To\r\nanimate their peoples in the struggle with Napoleon, several of the\r\nprinces had promised them constitutional government. Of the larger\r\nStates, only Bavaria, Baden, and Würtemberg, the former members of\r\nthe Napoleonic Rhenish Confederacy, kept these promises. Bavaria and\r\nBaden received constitutions in 1818; Würtemberg, where for once the\r\nking was more liberally minded than the estates, in 1819; and in\r\nlittle Saxe-Weimar, Karl August, the pioneer of political freedom in\r\nGermany, had given his people a free constitution and inaugurated a\r\nParliamentary idyll as far back as 1816.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, was of small significance in view of the fact\r\nthat Austria, after, as well as before, the Peace, represented the\r\nreactionary principle, and that Prussia, with a population more\r\ninclined than any of the others to political activity, adhered\r\nunhesitatingly to the Metternichian principles.\r\n\r\nYet the Prussian people not only desired a constitution, but possessed\r\na right to it. They had it in black and white. In an edict of 1810, the\r\nChancellor, Prince Hardenberg, the restorer of the power of Prussia,\r\nhad held out the prospect of representative government. During the\r\nwar with Napoleon the promise had been repeated, and finally, in an\r\nordinance of the 22nd of May 1815, a formal promise had been made to\r\nthe people, a clear intimation of the king's intention to appoint\r\nwithout delay a committee whose task it should be to prepare the draft\r\nof a constitution. But as the Metternichian principles gained ground,\r\nthe realisation of this plan was postponed. When Görres ventured to\r\npresent to Hardenberg an address from the Rhine provinces, in which\r\nthe King of Prussia was reminded of his promise, the only answer he\r\nreceived was, that the king who had given the promise had also, in\r\nhis wisdom, reserved the right to judge of the proper time for its\r\nfulfilment. On several later occasions the king declared himself to\r\nbe bound by his promise, but at the same time always insisted that\r\nthe question of time must be left to his fatherly care to decide.\r\nAnd meanwhile full twenty-five years passed--the rest of the king's\r\nlife.[1]\r\n\r\nThe object of the Powers was to eradicate every trace of the Napoleonic\r\nadministration. In Hanover, for example, the _Code Napoléon_, with\r\nits public, verbal judicial proceedings, was abolished, and the old\r\ninquisitional system of the sixteenth century, with its secret modes of\r\nprocedure, was re-established. The peasants, who had been liberated by\r\nthe French, had to return to serfdom and villeinage. The principle of\r\nequality before the law was set at naught, the aristocracy re-acquiring\r\nthe political and social privileges which they had possessed in the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nAnd just as the first germs of a freer political life were ready to\r\nsprout in South Germany, an event occurred which gave the signal\r\nfor much stronger, much hastier reaction, one symptom of which was\r\nthe employment of the most violent measures in the repression of\r\nunimportant and innocent expressions of popular feeling. This event was\r\nthe assassination of Kotzebue, or, to be more correct, the enthusiasm\r\nfor the assassin which his deed awakened throughout Germany, then\r\nsuffering from oppression and espionage.\r\n\r\nThe strong national feeling and the enthusiasm for freedom which\r\nhad asserted themselves during the conflict with France, had in the\r\nyears following on that conflict given birth to two movements among\r\nthe youth of Germany, to which the attention of the Governments were\r\nnow directed--the gymnastic and the student movement (Turnwesen and\r\nBurschenschaftswesen).\r\n\r\nJahn, the populariser of gymnastics, who succeeded Fichte in the\r\nfavour of the youth of Germany, opened the first school of gymnastics\r\nin Berlin. He had belonged to Lützow's free-lance Jaegercorps, was\r\na German of Germans and a hater of the French, and went about with\r\nhis long, unkempt grey hair hanging over his shoulders, bare-necked,\r\nhis broad shirt-collar thrown wide open, and a thick, knotted stick\r\nin his hand. In the course of the holiday excursions which he made\r\nwith his pupils, whenever they came upon a French sign-board or met a\r\nfashionably-dressed man, they would draw up round the object of their\r\ndetestation, bawling: \"Oh! Oh!\" On these excursions the strictest\r\ntemperance in food and drink was observed; they lived chiefly on\r\nbread and water, and bivouacked at night under the open sky. From\r\nround the fire rose the strains of the worthy Massmann's beautiful\r\n_Turnerwanderlied:_\r\n\r\n   \"Stubenwacht, Ofenpacht,\r\n    Hat die Herzen weich gemacht,\r\n    Wanderfahrt, Turnerart\r\n    Macht sie frank und hart.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThis Massmann, who, besides being one of the leaders of the\r\ngymnastic movement, was one of the founders of the students' unions\r\n(Burschenschaften), is the same who figures so frequently as scapegoat\r\nin Heine's poems and prefaces.[3]\r\n\r\nJahn soon became the object of the most ardent admiration, not only on\r\nthe part of immature youth, but of men of note and of public bodies.\r\nPoets inscribed their verses to him; a philologist like Thiersch\r\ndedicated his _Pindar_ to him, and compared German to Greek gymnastics;\r\ntwo universities invested him with an honorary degree. He himself was\r\na most loyal subject, but it was the fashion among his long-haired,\r\nbare-necked gymnasts with the unbleached linen jackets to jeer at\r\nthe army, especially at the dandy officers of the guard. They raved,\r\ntoo, against abstract enemies; among their rules was one for the\r\nassassination of the enemy of the good cause; they were to aim with a\r\ndagger at his eyes, and, when the victim covered his face, to strike at\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\nThis movement emanated from Berlin, the student movement from\r\nThuringia. The latter began as a sort of semi-national, semi-Christian\r\nenthusiasm, and aimed among other things at the reform of the low\r\nstandard of manners and morals among the students. Originating in one\r\nof the small States of Germany, it took for its programme that famous\r\nsong of Arndt's which declares the whole of Germany to be the German's\r\nfatherland.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Jena professors a certain Fries had most influence among\r\nthe students, the same Fries who, in the preface to Hegel's _Philosophy\r\nof Right_, is loaded with invective as being the representative of\r\nshallowness. He was a violent Liberal, who had said that Hegel's new\r\ntheories did not grow in the gardens of science, but in the hotbeds\r\nof servility; and under his fostering care the endeavour after unity\r\nand abstract liberty spread amongst the youth of the universities. The\r\nbanner of the Burschen was black, red, and gold, said to have been\r\nsuggested by the colours of the uniform of Lützow's Corps, black, with\r\nred facings and gold buttons.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation commemoration-festival in 1817 first drew general\r\nattention to the gymnastic and student societies (Turner and Burschen).\r\nIt had suggested the idea of a meeting at the Wartburg of delegates\r\nfrom all the German student unions. In a pamphlet published on the\r\noccasion of the festival by Karl Sand, he names as the three enemies\r\nof German nationalism from time immemorial, Roman imperialism,\r\nmonasticism, and militarism. On the 18th of October, five hundred\r\nstudents, headed by several professors, marched up from Eisenach to\r\nthe Wartburg, where they dined in the Knights' Hall, placed at their\r\ndisposal by the liberal Karl August. After the repast the gymnasts gave\r\na display of their agility for the benefit of the astonished natives.\r\nIn the evening great bonfires were lighted, and then Jahn proposed\r\nthat, following the example of Luther, who had burned the Papal Bull,\r\nthey should burn what the enemies of the good cause had written.\r\nMassmann feelingly expressed his approval of the proposal, and bundles\r\nof old printed paper were produced, on which were inscribed the titles\r\nof the detested books written by the enemies of the gymnasts. There\r\nwere three by the notorious Schmalz, the first Rector of the University\r\nof Berlin, the Police Statute Book of the equally notorious Prussian\r\nMinister of Justice, Herr von Kamptz, the _Code Napoléon_, Kotzebue's\r\n_Deutsche Geschichte_, Haller's _Restauration_, &c, &c. The last things\r\nthrown into the flames were a Uhlan's corset, a queue, and a corporal's\r\nbaton.[4]\r\n\r\nWhen Fries in high-flown language bade the students farewell, he\r\nparticularly impressed on them that they had been in the country of\r\nGerman liberty, liberty of action and of thought: \"Here there is no\r\nstanding army,\" &c.; an expression rendered more absurd by the fact\r\nthat the army of Weimar consisted of a number of worthy artisans, who\r\nat times, in consideration of a small payment, appeared as hussars,\r\nwith high riding-boots and spurs, but without horses. In Hegel's\r\npreface to the _Philosophy of Right_ he remarks, _à propos_ of this\r\nspeech, that Fries was not ashamed, on the occasion of a notorious\r\npublic demonstration, to say of the constitution of the State that\r\nit was from below, from the people, that life would come, if true\r\npublic spirit prevailed; that only by the sacred chain of friendship\r\ncould a community, a society, be inviolably united. Hegel calls this\r\nthe very hall-mark of shallowness, this melting down of the elaborate\r\narchitecture of a rationally designed state into \"a broth of feeling,\r\nfriendship, and enthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\nMassmann published an account of the festival, in which he described\r\nhow night still brooded over Germany, but proclaimed that the blood-red\r\ndawn was about to break.\r\n\r\nMetternich succeeded in persuading both Prince Hardenberg and the\r\nEmperor Alexander to bring pressure to bear on Karl August in the\r\nmatter of this festival, and ever afterwards Karl August's nickname at\r\nthe court of Vienna was \"der Altbursche.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the books burnt in effigy at the Wartburg were some of\r\nKotzebue's. Kotzebue was publishing at this time in Weimar his\r\n_Litterarisches Wochenblatt_, a journal which flattered Russia and made\r\nmerry over the youth of Germany. Little as Goethe generally sympathised\r\nwith youth, he rejoiced with them, for once, at the insult offered to\r\nhis old enemy.[5]\r\n\r\nAs Councillor of the Russian Legation, Kotzebue from time to time sent\r\ncommunications to St. Petersburg, and was consequently supposed to be\r\na Russian spy. It is probable that his communications were no more\r\nthan harmless reports on literary matters, but, be this as it may, in\r\nthe eyes of the students, he was Beelzebub--Beltze- or Kotze-bue. At\r\nthe University of Giessen at this time, under the leadership of three\r\nbrothers Follen, fanatical Republicans, a species of Radicalism had\r\ndeveloped, which gloated over the idea of the assassination of tyrants\r\nand their instruments. In the students' songs such expressions occurred\r\nas: \"Freiheitsmesser gezückt!--Hurrah! den Dolch durch die Kehle\r\ngedrückt.\" (Draw freedom's knife from its sheath!--Hurrah! Thrust\r\nthe poniard into the throat.) Karl Follen, the leading spirit, had\r\ncompletely under his influence that young, narrow-minded mystic, Karl\r\nSand, who had the image of Jesus constantly before his eyes, and who,\r\non the 23rd of March 1819, drove his poniard into old Kotzebue's neck.\r\nOn a strip of paper which he left lying beside the corpse, was, amongst\r\nother writing, this line by Follen: \"You, too, may be a Christ.\"\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly clear that this murder, committed in a moment of\r\nreligious exaltation, could not be laid to the charge of the Liberal\r\nyouth of Germany; nevertheless, and more especially as Sand became\r\na species of saint in the popular estimation, Metternich and Gentz,\r\nthe Emperor of Austria, the King of Prussia, and the Czar, who was\r\nirritated by this expression of Russophobia, took united action, and\r\nthe Resolutions of Karlsbad were passed--provisional, exceptional\r\nlegislation for the universities, the \"demagogues,\" and the press. Thus\r\na censorship of the German press came into existence, answering to that\r\nprevailing in Russia now. Gentz was not mistaken when he called this\r\nthe greatest retrograde movement that had taken place for thirty years.\r\n\r\nUnder the pretext of combating a great revolutionary party, which they\r\nknew did not exist, the Governments began a war of persecution against\r\nwhat was then called Liberalism. Even the professor of theology at the\r\nUniversity of Berlin, De Wette, was dismissed, because he had written\r\na private letter of condolence to Sand's mother, which was seized and\r\nopened by the police. The reaction went the length of attacking the men\r\nwho represented the German national feeling which had arisen during the\r\nwar. Jahn was arrested, first confined in a fortress, and then sent to\r\nlive in a small town under police supervision. Arndt was entangled, as\r\na \"demagogue,\" in a criminal case, and lost his appointment. Görres,\r\nwho was dismissed, escaped over the frontier.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia the censorship was not only exercised in the case of books\r\nand newspapers printed in the country, but extended to foreign printed\r\nmatter. All German newspapers published in England, France, or Holland\r\nwere forbidden. The whole stocks of some publishers, Brockhaus, for\r\nexample, were subjected to a special censorship, on account of one\r\nor two pamphlets published by them. At all the universities trusted\r\nagents of the Government were appointed to watch over the disposition\r\nof the students and the lectures of the professors. All gymnastic\r\nand student societies were put down. The so-called old German dress,\r\nand the black, red, and gold colours were forbidden. The police\r\nespecially distinguished themselves in the carrying out of these\r\nlast prohibitions; they hunted coats, caps, tassels, ribbons, and\r\npipe-bowls, and any man caught wearing a straw hat, a red waistcoat,\r\nand a black coat was imprisoned on a charge, of high treason.\r\n\r\nSome Marburg students in the Twenties had ordered foils from a\r\nmanufactory in Solingen, and it was reported that the usual trade-mark,\r\n\"Prince,\" was wanting on these particular foils. The government of\r\nHesse-Cassel instituted an inquiry for the purpose of discovering if\r\nthe omission had been ordered by the students. To the great annoyance\r\nof the police, no cause for accusation was found. \"I am sorry for your\r\nstatesmen,\" said the French Minister, Comte de Serre, to the famous\r\nNiebuhr about this time; \"they are making war on students.\"\r\n\r\nA specially keen look-out was kept for prohibited combinations among\r\nstudents. When Arnold Ruge was imprisoned, Herr von Kamptz set the\r\nwhole police on the chase after a walking-stick belonging to him, on\r\nwhich the names of some Jena students were carved, the _corpus delicti_\r\nbeing finally confiscated in Stralsund. Ruge was tortured by long\r\npauses between his examinations, having to spend the intervals in a\r\ncell where life was rendered unendurable by vermin. Fritz Reuter had to\r\nexpiate the crime of having \"worn the German colours in broad daylight\"\r\nby imprisonment, first in a miserable hole in Berlin, and after having\r\nbeen condemned for high treason, in dirty fortress cells. A youthful\r\npolitical offender in Bavaria was sentenced to fortress-imprisonment\r\nfor treason on an indictment of which one of the gravest clauses was\r\nthat something resembling a German prince's robe had been found in\r\nhis room. Chiefly at the instigation of Austria, thousands of young\r\nPrussians were either imprisoned or driven into exile. In short,\r\nthe Liberal middle-class youth of the Germany of those days was as\r\nunprotected by the law and as much persecuted as are, in our days, the\r\nSocialistic youth of the fourth estate of the same country, or the\r\nLiberal youth of Russia.\r\n\r\nPolitical and religious reaction went, as usual, hand in hand. In the\r\nyear 1821, the Prussian Government concluded a concordat with the\r\nPope, which gave the Roman Catholic Church an influence in Prussia\r\nsuch as would have been unimaginable under Frederick the Great. In\r\nthe following year a new liturgy, more nearly resembling the Roman,\r\nwas introduced into the Protestant Church. And it is exceedingly\r\nsignificant that the word Protestantism now fell into disrepute.\r\nBy a Ministerial decree of the year 1821, the terms Protestant and\r\nProtestantism were forbidden in Prussia; the censors received orders\r\nnot to pass these words, but to substitute the word Evangelical.\r\n\r\nThe sadness that takes possession of all progressively inclined minds\r\nduring long and apparently hopeless periods of reaction now weighed\r\nupon the spiritual _élite_ of Germany. But the great majority fell\r\na quick prey to carelessness and political indifference. With the\r\nreaction, at first forced on them from without, they soon familiarised\r\nthemselves. Many began to be of opinion that a representative\r\nconstitution, such as had been promised to Prussia, was a thing of\r\nno value. Others felt it deeply that Prussia, which had made such\r\nsacrifices in the war with Napoleon, had not succeeded in obtaining\r\na constitution, while the South German States, which had to the last\r\nmade common cause with the enemy, had long enjoyed popular government\r\nand the privilege of Parliamentary debate; but they concealed their\r\nshame under a mask of contempt for these skirmishers, a contempt\r\nthat had a strong family resemblance to envy and anger. It was\r\nmalevolently pointed out that the Bundestag, in which Austria and\r\nPrussia predominated, took good care that the trees of the South German\r\nParliamentary system were well pruned down. The various Governments\r\nhad, moreover, succeeded in bringing such opposition as arose in\r\nthe South German States into disrepute. Ministers often succeeded\r\nin preventing an election that was objectionable to them; they also\r\nwon over opponents by direct bribery or fear of dismissal; and they\r\nhad always the final resource, to which they frequently resorted, of\r\ncompletely disregarding the oppositionist resolutions of the Chambers.\r\nAs the power was in the hands of the Governments, it lay in the nature\r\nof things that the proceedings of the Parliaments, up to 1830, were of\r\nno serious interest.\r\n\r\nThe German press had never occupied a high position. All discussion\r\nof State matters being now prohibited, it had to confine itself, as\r\nregarded politics, to the simple chronicling of facts, and to fill its\r\ncolumns with court news, accounts of storms and floods, the birth of\r\nmarvellous monsters in the animal, and the appearance of new stars in\r\nthe theatrical, world.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated classes sought a kind of compensation for their\r\nexclusion from politics in a frantically exaggerated interest in the\r\ntheatre. Never had the adoration of a prima donna or a ballet-dancer\r\nbeen carried to such an extreme. In the Berlin of the Twenties every\r\nother interest was swallowed up in the question of the superiority of\r\nGerman or Italian music. People thought of nothing but the rivalry\r\nbetween Spontini and Weber. When Börne came to Berlin in 1828, the\r\npublic mind was so engrossed with the famous singer, Henriette Sontag,\r\nthat no one remembered anything about Börne, except that he had written\r\nan article on her. In his _Letters from Paris_ (in \"Härings-Salat\")\r\nhe gives a witty and yet veracious account of how he was met and\r\nsaluted everywhere with the cry: \"This is the man who wrote about\r\nSontag!\" Even in 1832, everything--the agitation in France, the Polish\r\ndefeat, sympathy with the exiled Poles--everything was forgotten in\r\nthe enthusiasm for the feet of the great _danseuse_ Taglioni, which\r\nwere then setting out on their triumphal progress through Europe.\r\nThe chief representative of the reactionary spirit in Prussia, the\r\nHofmarschall and future diplomatist, General Theodor Heinrich von\r\nRochow, writes in May 1832 to von Nagler, the Postmaster-General: \"She\r\nis to dance, consequently there is great rejoicing, and occupation\r\nin abundance.... Taglioni's mimetic grace has dispelled the\r\nthreatening signs of the times.\"[6] The word occupation here\r\nis significant. The performance did not merely please, it occupied.[7]\r\n\r\nAs regards literature, the generation of that day luxuriated in an\r\nidolisation of the octogenarian Goethe, which accepted everything that\r\nthe aged master wrote or said as wisdom, and beauty, and inspired\r\npoetry. All his life long he had had to struggle against hatred and\r\nmisunderstanding; now the reverence for him verged on the ridiculous;\r\nin Berlin it verged on idiocy.[8] In Zelter's _Letters to Goethe_ he\r\nwrites, on the subject of the latter's _Elpenor_: \"Posterity will not\r\nbelieve that the sun of our days beheld the forthcoming of such a\r\nwork.\"[9] All those who had obstructed Goethe's path so long as his\r\nname still belonged to combatant literature, became his votaries from\r\nthe moment that that name conveyed undisputed authority, and could\r\nbe employed as a sort of Conservative and national emblem. Otherwise\r\nliterature languished. The day of romantic poetical fancy was at an\r\nend--Raupach and Müllner ruled the stage, Clauren fiction. Light\r\nliterature sank deeper and deeper into the slough of vulgarity and\r\npruriency.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Biedermann: _Dreissig Jahre deutscher Geschichte_.

Through the unpropitiousness of\r\ncircumstances, it became farther removed from reality than heretofore,\r\nthough more closely bound up with existing conditions.\r\n\r\nHegel is the great example. In March 1819, Karl Sand murdered Kotzebue;\r\non the 22nd of October of the preceding year, Hegel entered on his\r\nprofessorial duties at the University of Berlin. From the programme\r\nwhich he gave his audience in his opening address, it could be clearly\r\ndeduced that Hegel's philosophy and the Prussian State in its existing\r\nform were closely connected; for the said philosophy was based on\r\nthe omnipotence of the Idea, the State on the power of intelligence\r\nand culture. Of the fact that Prussia, allowing herself to be led\r\nby Austria, was at this very time proving false to her character\r\nand traditions by entering on a policy of spiritual and political\r\nreaction, no account was taken. Yet the Resolutions of Carlsbad were\r\nalready drafted, and it was Prussia that took the initiative in issuing\r\nall the petty tyrannical regulations which soon placed the whole of\r\nGermany under police surveillance. But the sentimental politics of the\r\nstudents were as obnoxious to Hegel as sentimental philosophy; the\r\nWartburg rendezvous was to him a piece of romantic foolery, and Sand's\r\nponiard-thrust an abomination. In the preface to the _Philosophy of\r\nRight_, the first and most important work he produced in Berlin, he\r\nnot only condescended to defend the persecution of the demagogues, but\r\ndemeaned himself by playing police agent, and denouncing his former\r\ncolleague, Fries, to the Governments: \"It is to be hoped that neither\r\noffice nor title will serve as a talisman for principles destructive\r\nboth of morality and public order.\" From this time onward Hegel became\r\nthe philosophic dictator of Germany. He ruled from Berlin over the\r\nwhole domain of German thought.\r\n\r\nYet in this same philosophy, even in a work with such a pronounced\r\nConservative tendency as the _Philosophy of Right_ there existed a\r\nportentous ambiguity. As early as in the above-mentioned notorious\r\npreface we find the proposition which was to become the classic motto\r\nof the age, which was first appropriated eagerly by the Conservatism\r\nof the Restoration period, and then used as a battering-ram by Hegel's\r\nyounger disciples. It is in larger print than the rest, in two lines:\r\n\r\n    \"What is rational is real,\r\n     What is real is rational.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? Hegel goes on to explain that when reflection,\r\nfeeling, or whatever other form the subjective consciousness may\r\nassume, regards the present as vanity, it is itself false, finds itself\r\nin emptiness. But, on the other hand, the doctrine that the idea is a\r\nmere idea or figment, philosophy meets with the assertion that nothing\r\nis real except the idea. What is all-important is to recognise that\r\nwhich is eternal in the present, temporal, transient; in other words,\r\nin this case, not to construct a state, but to understand the state as\r\nit exists.\r\n\r\nHegel's biographer, Haym, rightly says that not even the doctrine\r\nof divine right is so dangerous as this, which declares everything\r\nexisting to be sacred. But, on the other hand, it may with equal right\r\nbe maintained that not even the destructive ardour of the youthful\r\nrevolutionaries went so far as this doctrine, which grants reality\r\nonly to what is rational, and to all else nothing but a mock reality,\r\nwhich can and should be defied, disregarded, overturned, exploded.\r\nHence Robert Prutz could say of this same proposition that by it all\r\ndoubt was removed, the old God of darkness hurled into the abyss, and\r\na new, eternally reigning Zeus, the idea that comprehends itself, man\r\nas a thinking being, raised to the throne.[1]\r\n\r\nThe interpretations of Hegel's philosophy that soon appeared were\r\nmany and widely different, but the kinship between his doctrines\r\nand Goethe's poetry was felt by all the initiated. Hegel became the\r\nstrongest ally of the little circle of Goethe votaries in Berlin, and\r\nthe two men, known as the absolute poet and the absolute philosopher,\r\nwere the objects of a common veneration. The orthodox Hegelian even\r\nsaw a significant coincidence in the circumstance that Hegel was born\r\non the 27th of August and Goethe on the 28th. In the Twenties, the\r\nfaithful gathered round the festive board on the evening of the 27th of\r\nAugust, drank the toast of the master in the kingdom of thought, and\r\ncalled to mind the saying in the preface to the _Philosophy of Right_\r\nabout the owl of Minerva, which begins its flight only when the shades\r\nof night are gathering. \"But as soon as the midnight hour had struck,\r\nan orator rose to proclaim the glad tidings that Apollo, the God of\r\nday and of song, was now in his sun-chariot, ushering in the 28th, the\r\nglorious day.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe patriotism which in 1813 had driven the enemy out of the country,\r\ncontained two radically different elements, a historical, retrospective\r\ntendency, which soon developed into Romanticism, and a liberal-minded,\r\nprogressive tendency, which developed into the new Liberalism. When\r\nthe reaction came, it sought support in many of the theories of\r\nRomanticism, and finally took the whole movement into its pay. Men\r\nlike Görres, Friedrich Schlegel, and others, passed from the camp of\r\nRomanticism into that of reaction.\r\n\r\nThe freedom-loving group had, of course, during the wars with Napoleon,\r\nshared the Romanticists' hatred of France. But when their sympathies\r\ncame to take the shape of wishes and demands (for liberty of the press,\r\nconstitutional government, the franchise, &c), the hatred of France\r\ninevitably evaporated. And the stronger the reaction became, the\r\nmore keenly were all eyes turned to that neighbouring country which\r\npossessed Parliamentary government. The heroes of French Liberalism\r\nwere soon men of great consequence in the estimation of the German\r\nLiberals; indeed at a distance they seemed of more consequence than\r\nthey did at home. In Germany, after the victory over Napoleon, as after\r\nthe great defeat, quietness was the first duty of the citizen.[3] All was\r\nobedience and silence. And the result was what it usually is when a\r\nhighly gifted but unenergetic people are incapable of throwing off a\r\nyoke; its pressure generated self-contempt, and the self-contempt a\r\nkind of desperate wit, of chronic \"gallows-humour\"; the better sort\r\ndeveloped a real passion for solacing themselves with derision of their\r\nown impotence. The observation of existing conditions gave constantly\r\nrecurring occasion for irony directed against themselves--against\r\nvisionary Romanticism, the spirit of patience and submission in the\r\ndomain of politics, orthodoxy and pietism in the domain of religion.\r\nCaricature-like developments of political life, religion, and poetry\r\nincited to sarcasm, that sometimes ruthlessly wounded patriotic\r\nfeeling, sometimes assumed a frivolous tone which, taken in connection\r\nwith the French leanings of Liberalism, was, or inevitably seemed to\r\nbe, more French than German.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Haym: _Hegel und seine Zeit_, p. 365; R.

Adalbert von Chamisso, who, by virtue of his famous\r\nprose tale, _Peter Schlemihl_, and certain of his qualities, belongs\r\nto the German Romantic School, while in other respects he approaches\r\nmore nearly to the French ideal of thought and writing, is, in some of\r\nhis most characteristic poems, and even in his epigrams, a mouthpiece\r\nof the grief of the better sort over the steadily growing political\r\nand social reaction. As early as 1822, in his poem, _Die goldene\r\nZeit_ (\"The Golden Age\"), he ridicules an age in which that man is a\r\nJacobin who has openly expressed his belief that 2 and 2 make 4; in\r\nthe _Nachtwächterlied_ (\"Watchman's Song\") he scoffs at the power of\r\nthe Jesuits; in _Joshua_ and _Das Dampfross_ (\"The Steam Horse\"), at\r\nthose who have robbed time of its secret, and learned how to force\r\nit backwards day by day; in _Das Gebet der Wittwe_ (\"The Widow's\r\nPrayer\") he gives a darkly pessimistic picture of the heartless rule\r\nof the powers that be, with its complete indifference to the fate of\r\nthe common people; finally he sums up his view of the times in this\r\nbitterly humorous quatrain, which greets us sadly in the form of a\r\nfour-part catch:\r\n\r\n   KANON.\r\n   \"Das ist die Noth der schweren Zeit!\r\n    Das ist die schwere Zeit der Noth!\r\n    Das ist die schwere Noth der Zeit!\r\n    Das ist die Zeit der schweren Noth!\"[1]\r\n\r\nCount August von Platen-Hallermünde, whose youthful efforts were\r\nRomantic, both in their choice of subject and in their imitation\r\nof the forms of the Spanish drama, afterwards waged systematic war\r\nwith Romanticism. Its latest developments in Germany he holds up to\r\nridicule, without possessing enough of critical tact to discriminate\r\nbetween the authors who did and those who did not belong to the\r\nRomanticist group. He quits the literary drama to cultivate the\r\npolitical lyric muse, as he gradually arrives at the conviction that\r\nthe pitiable condition of public affairs is also at the bottom of the\r\nGerman people's lack of appreciation of power and style and form in\r\npoetry. He finds life in Germany impossible to endure, and seeks, under\r\nthe sunny skies of Sicily, amidst its reminiscences of antiquity, to\r\nforget the heavy atmosphere and the political abuses of his Northern\r\nhome. But he cannot completely distract his thoughts from the ignominy\r\nthere. He writes his Berlin national song, which begins with the\r\nchorus:\r\n\r\n   \"Diesen Kuss den Moscoviten,\r\n    Deren Nasen sind so schmuck;\r\n    Rom mit seinen Jesuiten\r\n    Nehme diesen Händedruck!\"[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find also the following bitter outburst of national self-contempt,\r\nwritten in wrath over the maltreatment of his poems by the censor:\r\n\r\n   \"Doch gieb, o Dichter, dich zufrieden,\r\n    Es büsst die Welt nur wenig ein;\r\n    Du weisst es längst, man kann hienieden\r\n    Nichts Schlechtres als ein Deutscher sein.\"[3]\r\n\r\nRomantically as Platen's adversary, Heinrich Heine, starts, the modern\r\nspirit soon makes itself perceptible in his prose. Even before he\r\ntouches on the subject of politics proper, he amuses himself, in his\r\n_Reisebilder_, by making taunting allusions to German conditions and to\r\nthe way in which German stolidity accommodates itself to them.\r\n\r\nAnd the love of liberty, abstract, political liberty, was all along\r\nthe true passion of Ludwig Börne, who long appeared to occupy himself\r\nwith purely æsthetic matters, being known for whole decades only as a\r\ndramatic critic and writer of short stories.\r\n\r\nThat these authors found readers and admirers bears witness to the fact\r\nthat the thinking part of the German people at the end of the Twenties\r\nwas laying aside its faith in authority in the domain of politics as\r\nwell as in general intellectual matters. At this time the persecution\r\nof the students' unions (Burschenschaften) was being carried on with\r\nthe utmost ardour. They were broken up everywhere. But they formed\r\nagain at once, and in one German State, Bavaria, after the accession of\r\nKing Ludwig, they were actually sanctioned by the police. The divisions\r\nthat occurred among them show the directions of the various currents of\r\npublic opinion at that time. In Erlangen, after 1827, there were three\r\nunions, at feud with each other--Teutonia, Arminia, and Germania.\r\n\r\nTeutonia was the organ of pure Romanticism, of religious mysticism, and\r\ndeclared that politics in no way concerned it. Arminia's principles\r\nwere strict morality and the pursuit of science; it aimed at the\r\nreformation of the conditions of public life, and also at the unity\r\nand liberty of Germany. Germania answered to the Radical tendencies\r\nof the day. It dropped the older _Tugendbund's_ requirement of strict\r\nmorality, emancipated itself from the rule of authority, including\r\nauthority in the matter of religion, and declared the belief that its\r\naim--which in the case of this union also was the unity and liberty\r\nof Germany--could only be attained by revolution. Though it was\r\nessentially a political organisation, it would be ridiculous to call it\r\nan important and dangerous one.\r\n\r\nThese three main movements were soon represented at all the German\r\nuniversities, and significantly enough, it was, as a rule, the one\r\nrepresented by Germania, which had the greatest influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\n   This is the need of these hard times!\r\n   These are the hard times of need!\r\n   This is the hard need of these times!\r\n   These are the times of hard need!\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] This kiss is for the Moscovites, with their handsome noses; this\r\nhand-clasp for Rome with her Jesuits.\r\n\r\n[3] Console thyself, O poet! 'tis but little the world loses; thou hast\r\nlong known that on this earth a man can be nothing worse than a German.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE REVOLUTION OF JULY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1830, while things were in this state of stagnation, oppression, and\r\nferment, the news of the Paris Revolution of July arrived, and acted\r\nupon public feeling in Germany like an electric shock. All eyes were\r\nturned towards Paris, and among thinking people real enthusiasm was\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nThe effect was perhaps most plainly observable among the quite young\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nTwo months before the Revolution, Karl Gutzkow, then nineteen, had, as\r\nhe himself has told us, no understanding whatever of European politics.\r\nHe neither knew who Polignac was, nor what it meant to violate _la\r\nCharte_ (the French constitution). He only knew that in spite of all\r\nthe persecution of the German student unions (Burschenschaften),\r\nthey were still alive, and that the object to be attained was the\r\nunification of Germany. If he thought at all of upheavals which\r\nmight hasten the march of events, he looked for them rather from\r\nthe direction of Erlangen or Jena than from Paris; at the utmost he\r\nconceived it possible that a troop of returning Philhellenes landing\r\narmed at Stralsund, might take forcible possession of the town and\r\ncall the Pomeranian militia (Landwehr) to arms, and that the peasants,\r\ndriven to it perhaps by famine, might join in the revolt.\r\n\r\nAt this time the French author, Saint-Marc Girardin, had come to Berlin\r\nto study the German language, the Prussian school system, and also the\r\nUniversity theology as represented by Schleiermacher and Neander, and\r\nthe Pietism emanating from Halle. As a contributor to the _Journal des\r\nDébats_, he received his newspaper regularly from Paris, and with the\r\neager interest of the aspirant to office, followed the progress of the\r\nOpposition in France. Gutzkow gave him a German lesson daily; they read\r\none of Kotzebue's comedies, which the Frenchman preferred as practice\r\nto Goethe or Schiller, but they invariably drifted into political\r\ndiscussions. Gutzkow made no attempt to conceal from Saint-Marc\r\nGirardin the slight general significance he attached to the French\r\nconstitutional struggle, openly ascribing a greater influence on the\r\ncourse of history to the student union in Jena than to the Chamber of\r\nDeputies in Paris. Girardin smilingly gave a polite answer. From time\r\nto time these conversations were interrupted by Eduard Gans, the famous\r\nPrussian professor, Hegel's most renowned disciple in the faculty\r\nof law, Varnhagen's and Heine's friend, who in fluent French joined\r\nin the political argument, and made a great impression on Girardin\r\nby his woolly black hair and his whiskers. Gutzkow, who had heard\r\nthe fashionably dressed, subtle and sarcastic professor ridicule the\r\nstudent movement from his professorial chair, and laughingly confess\r\nthat he too once on a day, on the banks of the Saale, had deliberated\r\nupon the best means of helping Germany to an imperial crown, entreated\r\nthe French politician not to believe that the youth of Germany thought\r\nwith Gans. \"I am quite aware of it,\" answered Girardin, \"you intend to\r\nliberate the world with Sanscrit.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of August 1830, the king's birthday was celebrated with\r\nsong and speech in the great hall of the Berlin University. The\r\nstudents stood crowded together in front of the barrier behind which\r\nsat professors, officials, and officers of high rank. The famous\r\nphilologist Boekh was the orator, and from the gallery above his\r\nhead songs were sung by the University choir, under the leadership\r\nof Music-Director Zelter, Goethe's correspondent. The Rector of the\r\nUniversity, Professor Schmalz, with queue and sword, went from chair to\r\nchair, exchanging a few words with the most honoured guests. But Gans,\r\nexcited and impatient, passed round letters from Friedrich von Raumer,\r\nwho had just come from Paris. The Crown Prince, afterwards Frederick\r\nWilliam IV., sat and smiled; but all knew that a few days ago in France\r\na king had been dethroned. It was as if the thunder of the barricade\r\ncannonade were booming through the festive hall. Boekh's speech on the\r\nsubject of the fine arts did not succeed in arousing attention, and\r\nwhen Hegel read from the chair the names of the prizewinners of the\r\nyear, no one except the medallists listened. Gutzkow did hear with\r\none ear that he had taken the prize in the faculty of philosophy,\r\nbut with the other he heard of a people that had deposed a king, of\r\ncannonades, of thousands fallen in the fight. He was oblivious to\r\nthe congratulations offered him; he did not even open the case which\r\ncontained the gold medal with the king's portrait; he had forgotten\r\nthe hope of a professorship which he had connected with the thought of\r\nwinning this medal; he stood dazed, thinking of Saint-Marc Girardin and\r\nhis prophecies, and of what he himself had prophesied of the German\r\nBurschenschaft. Then he rushed off to a confectioner's shop in Unter\r\nden Linden, and for the first time in his life read a newspaper with\r\navidity. He could hardly await the publication of the official gazette\r\nthat evening; not because he was impatient to see his name in the list\r\nof medallists; all he wished was to know the state of matters in Paris,\r\nwhether or not the barricades were still standing, whether France\r\nwas to come forth from Lafayette's hands a republic or a monarchy.\r\n\"Science lay behind me,\" he writes, \"history before me.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAnd Gutzkow is a type of the youngest generation of the Germany of that\r\nday--the young men of twenty.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with Karl Gutzkow's political awakening, there\r\noccurred a memorable misunderstanding in the study of the octogenarian\r\nGoethe. A visitor, greeted by the old man with exclamations of joy over\r\nthe great event in Paris, at first believed that he meant the Days of\r\nJuly, and only gradually came to understand that he was talking of the\r\ndecision of the scientific dispute between Cuvier and Saint-Hilaire in\r\nfavour of the latter. This famous misunderstanding has long enough been\r\nregarded as only a symptom of Goethe's limitation in matters political;\r\nit is but fair to point out that the anecdote is also an indication of\r\nthe old sage's justifiable indifference to over-estimated political\r\nevents. The scientific dispute was, by reason of the idea involved, and\r\nits transforming effect on the spiritual map of the world, a weightier\r\nmatter than the French Revolution of July. Does not Saint-Hilaire's\r\ntheory of the unity of \"plan\" herald _The Origin of Species!_ But the\r\npicture of the overwhelming effect of the French political catastrophe\r\non the youngest generation stands out all the sharper against the\r\nbackground of Goethe's impassibility.[2]\r\n\r\nThe impression made on eminent individuals belonging neither to the\r\nyoungest nor the oldest generation was very deep.\r\n\r\nThe most intellectual and open-minded woman of the day, the most\r\ndistinguished of Goethe's female admirers, Rahel, who by this time was\r\nsixty, was in entire sympathy with the Revolution. To her, as a woman,\r\nthe social side was of more interest than the political. Saint-Simonism\r\ntakes strong hold upon her; her marvellously youthful mind perceives\r\nits possibilities, and in the events of July she sees the beginning of\r\nthe triumph of its social theories.\r\n\r\nTo the reviving, inspiriting impression of the Revolution of July\r\nwas now added another, which gave a sharp edge to the passionate\r\npolitical feeling of the younger generation--the impression, to\r\nwit, made by the outbreak of the Polish revolt. It is most plainly\r\nobservable in the case of Platen, who in wild excitement addresses a\r\npoetical adjuration to the Crown Prince of Prussia (said to be the\r\nmost favourably disposed) to take the part of unhappy Poland, and also\r\nwrites the _Polenlieder_, the only poems of his that rise to the height\r\nof passion, proud songs of liberty, full of outspoken scorn of the\r\nautocrat who was worshipped at the German courts as an almighty being,\r\nand of those who allowed themselves to be bribed and bought with his\r\nroubles.\r\n\r\nOn Ludwig Börne's mind the news of the Revolution of July acted with\r\nthe effect of a flash of lightning.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1830 he was at the watering-place of Soden, near\r\nFrankfort-on-Main, recovering from a long bout of rheumatic fever and\r\nrepeated attacks of hemorrhage. His _Journal_ shows that his political\r\nhopes were almost extinguished, his desires stifled. A soul like his,\r\nwhose aspiration after liberty was a passion, whose hunger and thirst\r\nafter righteousness consumed his vital force, was unable permanently to\r\nbear the heavy weight of political reaction.\r\n\r\nHe was now forty-four, and since the time of the War of Liberation,\r\nthat is to say as youth and grown man, had had experience of nothing\r\nbut the triumphs of baseness and its persecution of all rectitude, all\r\nfreedom of opinion. He had never been able to lift his eyes from the\r\nsheet of paper he was writing on, without seeing pallid fear of every\r\ngreat passion, of ideals, of youth itself, enthroned in high places,\r\nside by side with the animal instinct of self-preservation and animal\r\nself-indulgence--the Metternich and Gentz principle. He had given up\r\nnone of the convictions of his youth and manhood, but the world to\r\nhim was draped in mourning weeds. He had the feeling in Germany of\r\nsitting at the bottom of the sea, a diving-bell providing him with\r\njust enough air to keep him from suffocation. In Paris he had breathed\r\nfresh air. There the light of the sun, human voices, the sounds of life\r\nhad enraptured him. Now, down among the fishes, he shivered with cold.\r\nHe suffered the most terrible ennui. The stillness made him ill; the\r\nnarrowness of everything galled him to the quick.\r\n\r\nHe describes himself as one of those natures which cannot in the long\r\nrun endure the \"solo music\" of existence. \"Symphonies of Beethoven or\r\nthunder-storms\" were a necessity to him. He was one of the people who\r\nfeel themselves out of place in a box at the theatre, who sit from\r\nchoice in the pit, in the middle of the crowd.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him as if in Germany the bullion of life were minted\r\nunderground, in the silence of midnight, like counterfeiters' coin.\r\nThose who worked did not enjoy, and those who enjoyed, who in the\r\nlight of day set the money in circulation that had been coined in\r\nfear and trembling in the darkness, did not work. In France a man of\r\nhealth and spirit lived a life like that of a king's messenger, who\r\nis sent with despatches to foreign towns, never twice to the same\r\nplace, and who on his long journeys sees and enjoys life in its most\r\ndifferent developments; in Germany he lived like a postilion, who is\r\nalways taking the same short journey back and forwards between two\r\npost-houses, receiving a miserable tip from fortune for his trouble.\r\nThe postilion was perfectly able to take the journey in his sleep; he\r\nknew every stone on his ten miles of road; and this in Germany was\r\ncalled thoroughness; but Börne, sitting in the little hotel in Soden,\r\nwatching the geese fighting in the yard, and studying the jealousy of\r\nthe turkey-cocks and the coquetry of the turkey-hens, was not grateful\r\nfor the opportunity of remarkable thoroughness afforded him.[3]\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached him that Polignac's ministry had issued\r\nthe famous ordinances, had violated the constitution, he cried,\r\nanticipating all the consequences of this step: \"And God said, let\r\nthere be light!\"\r\n\r\nThe news of the Revolution of July followed. Every day he awaited the\r\nhour of the arrival of the newspaper with impatience; he walked out the\r\ncountry road, on the lookout for the mail; if it delayed too long, he\r\nwent all the way to Höchst, where the papers came from. Soon he felt\r\nunable to remain in Soden. He returned to Frankfort, and astonished,\r\nelectrified his environment by his fire. The silent, invalid-looking\r\nBörne was unrecognisable; a miracle seemed to have happened; he was\r\nyoung and strong again. All his old dreams seemed to have become\r\nrealities, and everything in him that he had been forcibly keeping down\r\nsprang up again like a spring when pressure is removed.\r\n\r\nFrankfort did not long satisfy him; presently we hear of him in Paris.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of September he writes from Strasburg: \"The first French\r\ncockade I saw was on the hat of a peasant who passed me in Kehl coming\r\nfrom Strasburg. It seemed to me like a little rainbow after the flood\r\nof our time, a sign of peace from a reconciled God. But when the\r\nbright tri-coloured flag greeted my eyes--oh! words cannot express\r\nmy emotion. My heart beat so violently that I was on the point of\r\nfainting.... The flag was on the middle of the bridge, its staff\r\nrooted in French ground, but part of the bunting waving in German air.\r\nAsk the first Secretary of Legation you meet if this is not a breach\r\nof international law. It was only the red stripe of the flag that\r\nfluttered over our native soil. And this is the one colour of French\r\nliberty that will be ours. Red, blood, blood--and alas! not blood shed\r\non the battlefield.\"\r\n\r\nBörne is here only the mouthpiece of a feeling which had taken\r\npossession of most of the many in Germany who were susceptible of\r\nenthusiasm. The heroism shown by the French students, polytechnicians,\r\nand working men during _les trois jours glorieux_ was admired as much\r\nas in France itself, and doubly admired as the proof of an energy\r\nwhich the German people appeared to have lost. There was a universal\r\ninclination to drift into exaggerated contempt of their own want of\r\npolitical aptitude and insight, their own want of ability to act at the\r\ndecisive moment.\r\n\r\nThus powerfully did events act upon characters like Börne, and upon the\r\nenthusiasts who were to be found in greatest numbers in the scholarly\r\nclass. Let us complete the picture by observing their effect on the men\r\nof the reaction.\r\n\r\nGentz, who had at first exulted over Charles X.'s energy, grew anxious\r\nas the _coup d'état_ approached. \"I look upon the ordinance against\r\nnewspapers and books,\" he writes, \"as a tremendous venture, of the\r\nsuccess of which I am as yet by no means assured.... Such weapons\r\nought to be played with only by people who are sure of their strength\r\nand of the means at their disposal. To venture into such regions means\r\nruin for men like Polignac and Peyronnet.\"[4]\r\n\r\nAs soon, however, as the first alarm had subsided, he and his spiritual\r\nkindred set to work to take advantage of every mistake made by the\r\nLiberals. Wisely turned to account, the after-effects of the Revolution\r\nof July in Germany, by the occasion they gave for ruthless repression\r\nand persecution, censorship, and imprisonment, might lame the German\r\nLiberal movement for many a day; might (as Metternich said a few years\r\nlater of the Hambach Festival) make the anniversary of the Revolution a\r\nday of rejoicing for the good instead of for the bad. And only a year\r\nlater, Gentz, who at times had seen the future in a very dark light,\r\nwas able to write: \"Away with all gloomy forebodings now! We are not to\r\ndie, Europe is not to die, and what we love is not to die. I am proud\r\nof never having despaired.\"[5]\r\n\r\nMetternich had enough literary taste to admire Börne, and Gentz was a\r\nfanatical Heine enthusiast. Before the Revolution of July it was still\r\npossible to look upon Heine as essentially the poet of unhappy love and\r\nthe poetical humorist, with a touch of blasphemy and frivolity.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1830 Heinrich Heine was at Heligoland, dreaming on the\r\nshore, gazing out to sea, listening to the plash of the waves. He had\r\ngiven up all hope of better times. He occupied himself with reading\r\nthe few books he had taken with him--Homer, the Bible, the history of\r\nthe Lombards, and some old volumes on witches and witchcraft. He could\r\nhardly himself believe that he had quite lately been the editor of the\r\n_Politische Annalen_ in Munich. Two days after the Revolution of July\r\nhad taken place, but before the news of it had reached Heligoland,\r\nhe wrote, in one of his letters from that island, that he had now\r\ndetermined to let politics and philosophy alone, and to devote himself\r\nentirely to the observation of nature and to art; that all this torture\r\nand trouble was to no purpose; that however great sacrifices he might\r\nmake in the general cause, they would be of little or no avail; the\r\nworld, doubtless, did not stand still, but it moved in a circle,\r\nwith no result whatever; when he was young and inexperienced, he had\r\nbelieved that even if the individual perished in the war of human\r\nliberation, the great cause would be victorious in the end; now he\r\nrecognised the fact that humanity, like the ocean, moved according to\r\nfixed laws of ebb and flow.\r\n\r\nEven if these expressions have been strung together at a later period,\r\neven if the letters are not genuine, but a fragment of memoir inserted\r\nlater, for the sake of contrast, in the book on Börne[6], they will\r\nundoubtedly give us a correct picture of Heine's mental attitude at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of August he writes: \"I was sitting reading Paul\r\nWarnefried's _History of the Lombards,_ when the thick packet of\r\nnewspapers, with the warm, glowing-hot news, arrived from the mainland.\r\nEach item was a sunbeam, wrapped in printed paper, and together they\r\nkindled my soul into a wild glow. I felt as if I could set the whole\r\nocean, to the very North Pole, on fire, with the red heat of enthusiasm\r\nand mad joy that glowed within me.\" It was all like a dream to him; the\r\nname Lafayette especially was like the echo of one of the stories of\r\nhis earliest childhood; he could hardly believe that the man who had\r\nridden in front of the grandfathers of the present generation in the\r\nAmerican War of Independence was once more on horseback, the hero of\r\nthe nation. He felt as if he must go to Paris and see it for himself.\r\n\r\nHe writes with a passionate fervour, which he soon feels obliged to\r\ntemper with a touch of self-contempt: \"Lafayette, the tri-colour flag,\r\nthe Marseillaise.... It intoxicates me. Bold, ardent hopes spring up,\r\nlike trees with golden fruit and with branches that shoot up wildly,\r\ntill their leaves touch the clouds.... My longing for rest is gone.\r\nI know once more what I desire, what I ought to, what I must, do....\r\nI am the son of the Revolution, and again I take into my hand the\r\ncharmed weapons, over which my mother spoke the magic spell.... Flowers,\r\nflowers! that I may crown my head for the death struggle. And the lyre,\r\ntoo; give me the lyre! that I may sing a song of battle.... Words\r\nlike flaming stars, that shoot down from the sky, set palaces on fire,\r\nand illuminate huts.... Words like burnished javelins, that whirr up\r\ninto the seventh heaven and transfix the pious hypocrites who have\r\ninsinuated themselves into the holy of holies.... I am all gladness\r\nand song, all sword and flame, and quite possibly mad.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other things, he tells how the fisherman who some days later\r\nrowed him out to the sandbank from which they bathed, told him the news\r\nsmilingly, with the words: \"The poor people have won the victory.\"\r\nHeine expresses his astonishment at the correct instinct of the common\r\nman. And yet the exact opposite was the real state of matters; it was\r\nthe rich people who in the end were and remained the victors.\r\n\r\nBut an utterance such as the last quoted suffices to show the light\r\nin which German authors regarded the Revolution of July. It inspired\r\nin them the same religious emotion with which forty years previously\r\nthe leading spirits of the Germany of that day had regarded the great\r\nRevolution. It was not to them the result of the strength of the\r\nLiberal bourgeoisie, and of their ability to persuade the lower classes\r\nto work and shed their blood for them; it was the general signal for\r\nthe political, economical, and religious emancipation of humanity. It\r\nwas the great deed that with one blow freed all nations from the yoke,\r\nall minds from oppression.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 one of the foremost of the Radical writers of the Forties,\r\nRobert Prutz (at the time of the Revolution only fourteen), gave an\r\nexcellent reproduction of the impression it created. \"For fifteen\r\nyears,\" he says, \"it had seemed as if the eternal generative power\r\nof the world's history were paralysed. For fifteen years they had\r\nbeen building and cementing, holding congresses, forming alliances,\r\nspreading the net of police supervision over the whole of Europe,\r\nforging fetters, peopling prisons, erecting gallows--and three days had\r\nsufficed to overturn one throne, and make all the others tremble. It\r\nwas not true then, after all, what the sovereigns had boasted, what the\r\ncourt romanticists had said and sung.\"[7] The millennial reign of the\r\nHoly Alliance had lasted fifteen years. It seemed as if a new spring\r\nmust be at hand in the political and intellectual life of the German\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Karl Gutzkow: _Das Kastanienwäldchen in Berlin. --Rückblicke auf\r\nmein Leben_, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[2] _Cf_.

Now it was resolutely dragged down to earth.\r\nThe modern ideal, an ideal which contains no mythic element, manifested\r\nitself to the dreamers and the workers. And with a haste, a violence,\r\nthat too often made prose journalistic, poetry only lyric or quite\r\nfragmentary, the opposition poets and prose writers set to work to draw\r\nall modern life into the sphere of literature. From the fact of this\r\ninclusion, this appropriation, taking place when things were on a war\r\nfooting, wit and satire became more prominent powers than they had ever\r\nbeen before in Germany; and the mood and inspiration of the \"Sturm und\r\nDrang\" period seemed to have revived, so far as aggressive defiance\r\nof the established was concerned. It was a strong craving for liberty\r\nthat first induced Heine and Börne to strike out a new path in German\r\nliterature, and afterwards inspired the writers who followed them, and\r\nwere known by the vague name of \"Young Germany.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was one great man who, foreigner though he was, influenced\r\nGerman intellectual life by his personality, writings, and actions\r\nmore than any of the famous men of the past. This was Lord Byron. It\r\nwas long before men's eyes in Germany were opened to his artistic\r\nweaknesses and deficiencies. Gutzkow alone, about the year 1835, begins\r\nto criticise him discerningly. But the Byron whom Goethe had admired\r\nand shown favour to (though principally because of that in him which\r\nthe old master attributed to his own influence), Byron, with his\r\ncontempt for the real negation of liberty that lay concealed beneath\r\nthe \"wars of liberty\" against Napoleon, with his championship of the\r\noppressed, his revolt against social custom, his sensuality and spleen,\r\nhis passionate love of liberty in every domain, transfigured by his\r\ndeath as a liberator, seemed to the men of that day to be an embodiment\r\nof all that they understood by the modern spirit, modern poetry.\r\n\r\nWilhelm Müller, the poet of the _Griechenlieder_, sings of him with\r\nfervent enthusiasm:\r\n\r\n   \"Siebenunddreissig Trauerschüsse? Und wen haben sie gemeint?\r\n    Sind es siebenunddreissig Siege, die er abgekämpft dem Feind?\r\n    Sind es siebenunddreissig Wunden, die der Held trägt auf der Brust?\r\n     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n    Siebenunddreissig Jahre sind es, welche Hellas heut beweint!\r\n    Sind' die Jahre, die du lebtest? Nein um diese wein ich nicht:\r\n    Ewig leben diese Jahre in des Ruhmes Sonnenlicht,\r\n    Auf des Liedes Adlerschwingen, die mit nimmer müdem Schlag\r\n    Durch die Bahn der Zeiten rauschen, rauschend grosse Seelen wach.\r\n    Nein, ich wein um andre Jahre, Jahre die du nicht gelebt,\r\n    Um die Jahre, die für Hellas du zu leben hast gestrebt:\r\n    Solche Jahre, Monde, Tage kündet mir des Donners Hall,\r\n    Welche Lieder, welche Kämpfe, welche Wunden, welchen Fall!\r\n    Einen Fall im Siegestaumel auf den Mauern von Byzanz,\r\n    Eine Krone dir zu Füssen, auf dem Haupt der Freiheit Kranz!\"[1]\r\n\r\nByron's pride and his contempt for political slavery meet us again in\r\nPlaten; his aristocratic tone, his antipathy to prejudice, his taste\r\nfor travel, his love of animals and of nature, his charm and his\r\nirony, live again in Prince Pückler. How enormously he influenced the\r\nformation of Heine's poetical ideal needs no insisting on, so forcibly\r\ndoes it strike every one who is familiar with the development of the\r\nmodern literature of Europe. But it is both remarkable and instructive\r\nto observe the light in which he was looked upon by Börne, the first\r\npioneer of the new German literary movement, a fundamentally different\r\ncharacter from the English poet. One would naturally imagine that\r\nthe vain, frivolous sides of Byron's personality would repel him, as\r\nthese same qualities did in the case of Heine. Far from it. Note the\r\nexpressions he employs in writing about him (_Briefe aus Paris_, No.\r\n44) after reading Moore's _Life of Byron_. He calls the book wine that\r\nsends a glow of warmth through the poor German wayfarer, shivering on\r\nhis journey through life. He feels almost ill with envy of such a life:\r\n\r\n\"Like a comet that submits to no rules and regulations of the star\r\ncommunity, Byron wandered through the world, wild and free; came\r\nwithout welcome, departed without farewell, preferring solitude to\r\nthe thraldom of friendship. His feet never touched the dry earth;\r\nthrough storm and shipwreck he steered undauntedly onwards, and the\r\nfirst harbour he came to was the grave. Oh, how he was tossed about!\r\nBut what islands of bliss did he not discover!... His was the kingly\r\nnature ... he is king who lives as he lists. When I hear people say\r\nthat Byron only lived for thirty-seven years, I laugh; he lived for a\r\nthousand. And when they pity him because he was so melancholy! Is not\r\nGod melancholy? Melancholy is God's gladness. Is it possible to be glad\r\nwhen one loves? Byron hated men because he loved mankind, hated life\r\nbecause he loved eternity. I would give all the joys of my life for a\r\nyear of Byron's sorrows.\"\r\n\r\nWe observe not only that Börne takes everything about Byron seriously,\r\nbut that he is quite unconscious of the same self-indulgent temperament\r\nin Byron which repelled him so strongly in Goethe. And it is still more\r\nsurprising that Börne should consider his own nature to be akin to\r\nByron's. He writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you ask me in surprise how such a beggarly fellow as I come\r\nto compare myself with Byron; in which case I must tell you something\r\nthat you do not know. When Byron's genius on his journey through the\r\nfirmament first came to this earth, he stayed for a night with me. But\r\nthe lodging was not to his mind; he left again at once, and took up\r\nhis quarters at the Hotel Byron. I sorrowed over this for many a year,\r\ngrieved over my insignificance, my failure. But that is past now; I\r\nhave forgotten it, and live contented in my poverty. My misfortune is\r\nthat I was born in the middle class, for which I am not suited.\"\r\n\r\nWords such as these bear striking witness to the magic power which\r\nthe shade of Byron still exercised over the minds of the leaders of\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] What mean these thirty-seven minute-guns? Do they tell of\r\nthirty-seven victories? of thirty-seven wounds on the hero's breast?...\r\nThey are thirty-seven years, that Greece is mourning to-day. Are they\r\nthe years of thy life? Nay, over these we do not mourn; these live\r\nfor ever in the sunlight of fame, borne upon the eagle wings of song,\r\nwhose tireless beat resounds down the ages, awakening great souls. 'Tis\r\nother years I weep, the years thou wouldst have lived for Greece. 'Tis\r\nof these years and months and days that the volley's thunder speaks to\r\nme. What songs, what struggles, what wounds, what a fall! A fall in the\r\nintoxicating moment of victory, on the walls of Byzantium, a crown at\r\nthy feet, on thy brow the wreath of liberty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF THE NEW LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was under the conditions and influences just described that the\r\nGerman opposition literature of 1820 to 1848 came into being. In\r\nsurveying such a large group of intellectual productions, we naturally\r\nlook upon them in the first instance as being, taken generally, a\r\nseries of documents which inform us how the people of that country\r\nand that time thought and felt, what were the developments of their\r\ncivilisation, what their hopes, their wishes, their philanthropy,\r\ntheir devotion to liberty, their sense of right, their ideal of good\r\ngovernment, and, finally, what their taste was--that is to say, in\r\nwhat manner an author required to write who wished to be read and to\r\nawaken real interest.\r\n\r\nOur historical curiosity on these points being satisfied, there\r\nnext involuntarily arises the question of the actual value of the\r\nliterature. In the case of philosophical writings this question\r\nturns mainly upon the measure of new truth they contain; or if, as\r\nis too often necessary, we are obliged to regard them chiefly in the\r\nlight of productions of the imagination, it turns upon the scope and\r\nsuggestiveness of their hypotheses. In the case of poetry and fiction,\r\nand also to a certain extent in the case of the allied historical and\r\ndescriptive writings, the question of their value is the same as the\r\nquestion of their beauty; for by beauty we mean artistic worth.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that out of a very large number of authors only\r\none or two continue to be read after the lapse of a few generations;\r\nout of an enormous number of works there is only one here and there\r\nthat people continue to make their own. Of the writers of the period\r\nunder consideration, very few are known and read to-day out of\r\nGermany; in Germany of course a considerably greater number; still,\r\ncomparatively few of the productions of that day are in the hands of\r\nthe general reading public.\r\n\r\nThe first rough criticism is thus the work of time; after the lapse of\r\nso many years, such and such an author does not sell, whilst another is\r\nperpetually coming out in new editions. But it is no absolute proof of\r\nthe worth of a writer that he long continues to have a wide circle of\r\nreaders. It does not prove that his place is among the best, only that\r\nhe is among the most approachable, the most entertaining. A high degree\r\nof culture, or of refinement of mind, may stand in the way of a wide\r\ncirculation, though they ensure lasting fame.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, out of Germany, only two of the philosophical\r\nwriters of that day, Feuerbach and Schopenhauer, are still read, the\r\nformer little, the latter much; but it was at a later period that\r\nSchopenhauer began to influence men's minds, and both these thinkers\r\nare read less for the sake of their matter than for their original,\r\ndaring style. Of the poets, only Heine is much and steadily read out of\r\nGermany. In Germany he is looked on and judged as the stinging-nettle\r\nin the garden of literature; he stings the historians' fingers and\r\nthey curse him. In histories of literature and magazine articles his\r\nprose is described as old-fashioned and his poetry as artificial;\r\nyet his works, now that the copyright has expired, are republished\r\nin innumerable editions. Both in and out of Germany he is as much\r\nsung as read. His poems have given occasion to more than 3000 musical\r\ncompositions. In 1887 the solo-songs alone (leaving out of account\r\nthe duets, quartettes and choruses) numbered 2,500. Hueffer has\r\ncounted one hundred and sixty settings of \"Du bist wie eine Blume,\"\r\neighty-three each of \"Ich hab' im Traum geweinet\" and \"Leise zieht\r\ndurch mein Gemuth,\" seventy-six of \"Ein Fichtenbaum steht einsam,\"\r\nand thirty-seven of \"Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten.\" Amongst\r\nthese compositions are many of the most beautiful songs of Schubert,\r\nMendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms, Robert Franz, and Rubinstein--very few\r\nof which the poet himself can have heard. Of all the German lyric poets\r\nHeine is the one whose songs have been most frequently set to music.\r\nAfter him, with his 3000 compositions, comes Goethe, with about 1700;\r\nthe others follow far behind.\r\n\r\nOut of Germany Heine's fame not merely lives unassailed, but is\r\nsteadily growing and spreading. In France he occupies men's minds as\r\nif he were a contemporary. He is the only foreign poet whom Frenchmen\r\nregard as one of their own, one of their greatest. No other foreign\r\nauthor is so frequently mentioned in the French literature of our own\r\nday, and none is named with greater admiration, not even Shelley or\r\nPoe. Edmond de Goncourt makes use of the strong expression, that all\r\nmodern French writers when compared with Heine remind him of commercial\r\ntravellers; and Théophile Gautier said that the Philistines sought to\r\ndrag the stones to build a pyramid above Heine's grave.\r\n\r\nA question that is constantly cropping up in one civilised society or\r\nanother is: What works should be included in a library of the hundred\r\nbest books? The answers of course vary very much. But in all Romanic\r\nand Slavonic countries, Heine's name is sure to be one of the first\r\non the lists. On English lists there are usually ninety English books\r\nand ten foreign, but Heine's name is certain to be among the ten. The\r\nbelief that it is possible to find a hundred books which would be\r\nthe best reading for every one, a belief which has its origin in the\r\nProtestant notion of there being one such great book, is of course\r\nchildish, and the question interesting only in so far as it shows what\r\nan entirely impersonal ideal of culture exists in the mind both of\r\nthe questioner and of those who naïvely set themselves to answer his\r\nquestion. It is instructive, however, _à propos_ of Heine, to notice\r\nthe results in certain specific cases. No small astonishment was\r\nexpressed in Germany a few years ago, when a great number of English\r\nlists were published, and Heine was found in them all--a distinction\r\nshown to no other German author, for there were lists which contained\r\nno book by Goethe.\r\n\r\nThis universal fame is not, however, founded on Heine's merits alone,\r\nbut also on the fact that much of his writing demands only the very\r\nslightest amount of culture for its comprehension, and of refinement\r\nof mind for its enjoyment; the latter quality being indeed rather a\r\nhindrance to the enjoyment of some of it. Still its main foundation is\r\nthe fact that, after all, his talent was, in its way, the most eminent\r\nof that period.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the value of a literary work of art is evidenced by its power\r\nof resistance to time, and its attraction for foreign readers, and\r\nyet these qualities form no proper criterion of its value, how are we\r\nto gauge it? By the originality and vigour of the spiritual life and\r\nof the emotion of which the work is an expression, together with its\r\npower of impressing these characteristics on the reader. All art is\r\nthe expression of some emotion, and has for its object the production\r\nof emotions. The deeper a signet gem is cut, the sharper, the clearer\r\nare the outlines in wax. The deeper the impression in the soul of the\r\nartist, the clearer, the more forcible is its artistic expression. The\r\nemotions of the artist differ from those of other men only in this,\r\nthat they leave in his memory that species of impression, which, when\r\nhe reproduces it, infects listener or reader.\r\n\r\nThe questions to which any work provides us with answers are such\r\nas the following: How far-sighted was the author? How deeply did he\r\npenetrate into the life of his time? How characteristically did he feel\r\njoy, or grief, or sadness, or love, or enthusiasm, or cynicism? We\r\nsay: So great was the horror, or disgust, inspired in him by stupidity\r\nor wickedness; so sharply or wittily did he revenge himself and us on\r\ncontemptible stupidity or worthlessness. From the best we receive an\r\nimpression of high-mindedness or greatness, of love of truth or love\r\nof beauty; in the case of inferior men we suffer from deficiency in\r\nunderstanding, in depth of feeling, in sense of beauty, or in strength\r\nof character.\r\n\r\nNow the literary group under consideration includes no creative minds\r\nof the highest, and only one of very high rank, namely Heine. It\r\nbequeathed to posterity little that was tangibly great. It denied, it\r\nemancipated, it cleared up, it let in fresh air. It is strong through\r\nits doubt, its hatred of thraldom, its individualism.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, especially in North Germany, it has never stood so low in\r\ngeneral estimation as at the present day. Those writers who, about the\r\nyear 1830, made war upon all the forms of tyranny which weighed upon\r\nthe German-speaking peoples, have in our days been overtaken by an\r\nunpopularity which shows no signs of decrease.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is simple. The younger generation of the Germany of\r\nto-day, which has the unification of the Empire behind it--that\r\nunification which to the men of 1830 was a fantastic hope--and which\r\nhas seen Germany put forth its united strength in prompt, universally\r\nsuccessful action, that generation takes little interest in the old\r\ndreamy speculations as to how the unification was to be brought about,\r\nand is bored by these old writers' everlasting ridicule of German\r\nsleepiness and inactivity, German pedantry and theorising, now that\r\nresults have shown how practical and how resolute the flouted Germany\r\ncould be when an opportunity was offered her.\r\n\r\nMore especially since the Franco-German war, the writers who half a\r\ncentury ago were always praising France at the expense of Germany,\r\nor maintaining that liberty would bring to Germany those blessings\r\nwhich actually came to her through Bismarck, have been placed under a\r\nsort of ban. They are looked on as bad patriots and foolish prophets.\r\nOnly a small minority are able to perceive how powerfully that very\r\nindignation, that scorn for the contemptible existing conditions,\r\nhelped to bring on the change and improvement that followed. And still\r\nfewer in number are those who read in the literature of the Thirties\r\nand Forties a living reproach for betrayed or forgotten ideals, and\r\nwho, as they turn over the leaves of these old books, ask themselves\r\nsadly what, in the new order of things, has become of the best that\r\nthese men fought for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nBÖRNE\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the authors who in those days stood in the foremost rank, Ludwig\r\nBörne is now almost the most neglected. The subjects on which he wrote\r\nare obsolete, and none but those interested in the personality of the\r\nwriter read his short prose pieces in the form of newspaper articles\r\nor letters, for the sake of the style, or of the spirit in which the\r\nsubject is treated. It was in the later years of his life that Börne\r\nfirst really made a name for himself by his _Letters from Paris_;\r\nand the abstract hatred of princes and the republican faith which\r\nfind expression in these letters are entirely out of place in the\r\nyoung Empire of to-day. No personality could be more utterly out of\r\nkeeping with the new order of things. Where the idea of the State is\r\nby slow degrees becoming all-powerful: where, from above, despotically\r\nsocialistic, it seeks to restrict initiative, transforms as many\r\ncitizens as possible into paid officials, and gives the paid official\r\nprecedence of the simple citizen, and from below, revolutionarily\r\nsocialistic, strives with all its might to restrict individual freedom\r\nof action: there markedly self-reliant characters inevitably disappear,\r\nand the rugged, independent individuality seems something illegal,\r\nsomething which no one can accept as a model of culture. Börne's was\r\njust such an angular individuality and perfectly independent character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUDWIG BÖRNE]\r\n\r\nIn the German middle-class of to-day, speaking generally, the only task\r\nthat seems worthy of a man is to build up, to forward, to strengthen\r\nor remould the already acquired. The iconoclastic tendency of Börne's\r\nmind at once alarms. The fire which warmed his age and generation is\r\nto the new generation that of a Don Quixote who charges with his lance\r\nat fortress and castle walls. And yet Börne, too, had a hand in the\r\nproduction of the iron architecture of the new Iron Age of Germany. His\r\nfire melted the ore out of which the new pillars of society have been\r\ncast.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing has injured Börne more in the estimation of the present\r\ngeneration than his violently prejudiced denunciation of Goethe.\r\nGoethe, as productive and intelligent spirit, is so great, and his\r\ntemperament and personality are so unique, that in our own day a man's\r\njudgment of him gives a valuable clue to that man's mind and character.\r\nAnd although in those days there were quite a number of writers, not\r\nonly belonging to the clerical party, but also among the opposition,\r\nwho detested Goethe, there can be no doubt that Börne gave clear proof\r\nof narrow-mindedness by the manner in which he wrote of the venerable\r\nold man in Weimar, by the nature of his protests against the general\r\nbelief in Goethe's greatness as a man and as a poet.\r\n\r\nBut in order to understand how it came about and what it signified that\r\na revolutionary political moralist like Börne entertained a feeling\r\nof positive hatred and of lasting and lively resentment towards the\r\ngreatest genius in all German literature, it is necessary that we\r\nshould understand how, from his very birth, Börne's fate placed him in\r\na position of antagonism to the great man whom he was driven to judge\r\nby an alien and therefore a false standard.\r\n\r\nGoethe and Börne were natives of the same town, born, one thirty-seven\r\nyears after the other, in Frankfort-on-Main. Frankfort was an old\r\nimperial fortified city, with gates and towers which indicated the\r\nboundaries of the town in earlier days, and an outer circle of gates,\r\ntowers, walls, bridges, ramparts and moats round the new town. It\r\nwas a fortified place enclosing smaller fortifications in the shape\r\nof monastic buildings and castle-like mansions. There was something\r\nunalterable about the town, which was surrounded by a sort of halo of\r\nancient, venerable independence. It was a patrician republic, in which\r\na stranger was practically without the pale of the law. Woe to him\r\nif he engaged in a law-suit with a Frankfort citizen in a Frankfort\r\ncourt of justice, though it might be clear as noon-day that he was in\r\nthe right! The ruling families formed an exclusive coterie, and their\r\nsocial intercourse was marked by much old-fashioned ceremony. No one\r\ndreamed of the possibility of tampering with any of the old political\r\nor social institutions of the city. The authorities had no spirit of\r\nenterprise, the inhabitants no feeling that change of any kind was\r\npossible. Such a thing as political cohesion with the rest of Germany\r\nwas unthought of. In the Germany of that day each town, and in the town\r\neach quarter, was a little world by itself.\r\n\r\nGoethe was a young patrician. His father was an Imperial Councillor\r\n(_kaiserlicher Rath_). As soon as the young man had acquired a thorough\r\nknowledge and understanding of his native town, it must have seemed to\r\nhim that fate could not possibly have any other lot in store for him\r\nbut that of a prosperous Frankfort citizen. For the town enthralled\r\nhim; its best families took possession of the handsome, gifted youth,\r\ntheir women made much of him, their tradition bound him. There was\r\nnothing to attract him to the larger towns, Vienna or Berlin, which\r\nwere then practically as far from Frankfort as Rome and St. Petersburg\r\nare in our days. Fate appeared to have destined him to become in\r\ndue time a lawyer, paterfamilias, public official, house-owner, and\r\nliterary notability in his native town.[1]\r\n\r\nGoethe's actual evasion of this fate was, as every one knows, mainly\r\ndue to the fact which calls down Börne's wrath upon him, that he became\r\nthe retainer of a prince, that the Duke of Weimar gave him an important\r\nappointment at his little court.\r\n\r\nBörne, too, was born in Frankfort-on-Main, but in the Jews' quarter.\r\nIn his day it was a misfortune to be born a Jew in Germany; for there,\r\nas elsewhere, the Jews had none of the rights of citizens. But it was\r\na special misfortune to be born a Jew in Frankfort-on-Main. In other\r\nlarge towns, the position which Jews by this time took in society to\r\na certain extent counterbalanced their political disqualifications.\r\nBoth in Vienna and Berlin many Jewish houses were frequented as centres\r\nof liberal-minded culture and brilliant wit. Jewesses of genius like\r\nRahel, charming Jewesses like Henriette Herz, Baroness Grotthuis,\r\nBaroness Arnstein, the Prince of Reuss's consort, and many others,\r\nwere soon to become leaders of society in the capitals of Prussia and\r\nAustria. But in Frankfort, in every walk of life, the barrier between\r\nthe religions was an impassable one.\r\n\r\nAll Jews were compelled to live in the narrow, mean, over-populated\r\nJudengasse, which was their only place of abode for 334 years, from\r\n1462 onwards. The contrast we read of in novels between the outward\r\nmeanness and inward splendour of the Ghettos did not exist here; the\r\ninteriors of the houses corresponded to their exteriors; in the small,\r\ndark rooms no display of splendour or of taste was possible. A few\r\nyears ago we had the best of all opportunities of judging of the kind\r\nof life the inhabitants of the Judengasse must have lived. One side\r\nof the street was pulled down, and a single stunted row of deformed,\r\nhunchbacked, cramped, startled-looking houses, in which great gaps had\r\nalready been made by the axe of the leveller, was exposed to the full\r\nlight of day, from which their little blinking bull's-eye windows gave\r\nthem the appearance of shrinking.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it began to grow dark, all the inhabitants of the Ghetto\r\nwere locked in. When they walked through the streets or round the\r\nramparts in the day-time, they dared not set foot on the pavement\r\nor foot-paths, but had to keep to the middle of the road. They were\r\nobliged to take off their hats and make a low bow to every passer-by\r\nwho called: \"Mach mores, Jud'!\" In order to prevent their too rapid\r\nincrease, only fourteen couples were permitted to marry each year.\r\nAlthough even at that time a large proportion of the Frankfort Jews,\r\nwith Rothschild at their head, were wealthy, a strong society barrier\r\nexisted between the religions. They were even separated in the Masonic\r\nLodges, which are consecrated to \"brotherly love\" and the worship of\r\n\"the highest Being.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clear that such a condition of things must have had a strong\r\ninfluence on a receptive young mind.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of May 1786, in house No. 118 of that Judengasse which has\r\nnow disappeared, there was born to the \"Jew merchant Jakob Baruch\" a\r\nthird son, the same who in 1818, shortly before his baptism, exchanged\r\nthe name Juda Low Baruch, given him at his birth, for that of Ludwig\r\nBörne. The family stood in very high estimation. Börne's grandfather\r\nwas a rich and remarkably benevolent man. He built and fitted up a\r\nsynagogue for the community at his own expense. He was the business\r\nagent at Neckarsulm of the Teutonic Order, and was thence transferred,\r\non account of his ability and honesty, to Mergentheim, the headquarters\r\nof the Order, where he took up his residence. An Electorship becoming\r\nvacant, he did such good service, in the course of the election, to\r\nthe House of Hapsburg, that Maria Theresa with her own hand signed a\r\ndocument promising all sorts of privileges to him and his descendants\r\nif they should at any time take up their abode in Austria.\r\n\r\nThis man's son, Jakob Baruch, inherited, it seems, his father's ability\r\nand sagacity without his orthodox religious faith. He was a clever man\r\nof business, with considerable diplomatic talent, much esteemed at\r\ncourts and by high officials for his knowledge of human nature, his\r\nclearsightedness and coolness; a cold, prudent man, to whom life had\r\ntaught the lesson that the best thing those in his position could do\r\nwas to live quietly and thus avoid exciting hatred. He held enlightened\r\nopinions on religious subjects, and the wearisome Jewish ceremonial,\r\nwhich, chiefly for his father's sake, he felt obliged to observe with\r\nall his household, was a burden to him personally. It was not till late\r\nin life that he tried to emancipate himself. Being a rich man's son,\r\nhe had received a fair education; it is said that he was at the same\r\nschool in Bonn as Prince Metternich; but his cautiousness led him to\r\ngive strict orders to his own son's one tutor to confine himself to the\r\nold Jewish course of instruction--the Bible, the prayer-book, and the\r\nTalmud.\r\n\r\nThe boy was quiet and shy. As he was the one of her children his mother\r\ncared least for, and was constantly in disgrace with the tyrannical old\r\nservant, his home-life was one of severe discipline, his father too,\r\nno doubt with the manifestation of independence in thought or action.\r\nOne result of this was, that when he first came into contact with the\r\nouter world, his emotions blunted, his intellect doubly keen, he looked\r\nat everything from the purely intellectual point of view. A thing was\r\nstupid or not stupid, and that was all.[2]\r\n\r\nThe religious observances of his home and of the synagogue aroused in\r\nthe boy a feeling of aversion as dead ritual; the religious instruction\r\nhe received at home made as little impression on him as his attendance\r\nat the synagogue. Certain prayers, as, for instance, the prayer for the\r\nreinstitution of sacrificial worship, displeased him, in spite of his\r\nboyish orthodoxy. To the horror of those about him, he said: \"That is a\r\nstupid prayer.\"\r\n\r\nHis learning was mere committing to memory, his teacher not believing\r\nhimself what he taught; and it was all quickly forgotten. As a grown\r\nman, he did not know a single word of Hebrew, had no understanding\r\nwhatever of Jewish customs, and no affection even for the Old\r\nTestament, of which Heine was such an enthusiastic admirer. The man who\r\nhimself reminds us of an Old Testament prophet, has not one allusion\r\nto the prophets in all his writings. From time to time, indeed, with\r\ncomplete indifference, and merely as a well-known illustration, he\r\nrefers to some Bible narratives; but as Steinthal acutely observes,\r\nhe quotes even such a passage as Samuel's republican warning against\r\nthe establishment of a kingdom, which one would expect to excite his\r\nevery sympathy, as if he were quoting one of Æsop's fables.[3]\r\n\r\nSchiller's essay, _The Mission of Moses_, was the first hint of a\r\nrational conception of religion that reached the boy. It made a deep\r\nimpression on him, and shook his faith. Naïvely simple as the essay\r\nis, with its implicit trust in the historic accuracy of the Bible\r\nnarrative, it yet inevitably produced a revolution in the mind of the\r\nyouthful reader, who now for the first time saw the most important\r\nevents in the life of his people and of their lawgiver divested of\r\nevery miraculous element, Providence itself being superseded by\r\n\"destiny.\"\r\n\r\nVarious anecdotes exist, illustrating the awakening of the spirit of\r\ncriticism in the boy, and the play of the different forces which formed\r\nhis character. One day, when it was raining heavily and the road was\r\ninch-deep in mud, he was walking with his tutor outside the gates of\r\nthe town. \"Let us walk on the footpath,\" said Börne. \"Do you not know,\"\r\nanswered the teacher, \"that we are forbidden to do that?\" The boy's\r\nreply, \"no one sees us,\" gave the tutor an opportunity for a moral\r\nexhortation, with remarks on the sacredness of law. \"That is a stupid\r\nlaw,\" said Börne.\r\n\r\nThe tutor was careful to avoid occasions of exciting bitterness in the\r\nchild. But there were so many. No Jew was allowed to be present at\r\nany open-air public amusements, not even at a balloon ascent. On all\r\nfestive occasions, as, for instance, when the town was decorated for\r\nthe reception of royal guests, the Jews were shut up in the Judengasse;\r\non the day of the coronation of Leopold II. some of their leading men\r\nventured out, but were at once arrested and taken to the guard-house.\r\nThey were prohibited from entering most of the hotels, and from setting\r\nfoot in any public grounds or open spaces. The general rule was: Where\r\nthere is green grass, no Jew must be seen. On Sundays the gates of\r\nthe Judengasse were locked at four o'clock in the afternoon, and the\r\nsentry allowed no one to pass out except persons taking letters to the\r\npost-house or going for medicine to the apothecary's. Little Börne used\r\nto say: \"I only don't go out because the sentry is stronger than I am.\"\r\nYet when the boy, who early showed signs of a distinctly benevolent\r\ndisposition, was accosted one day by two beggars, the one a Jew, the\r\nother a Christian, it was to the latter he gave all the money he had\r\nin his pocket. \"Why do you not give the preference to one of your own\r\npeople?\" asked the tutor. \"Because it is written in the Proverbs of\r\nSolomon that we are to heap coals of fire on our enemies' heads.\" The\r\nconscientious tutor would not hear of this reason: \"it was based on the\r\nfalse assumption that the Christians are the enemies of the Jews.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that such impressions, received in childhood,\r\nmust have caused Börne's ancestry to weigh more upon his mind than it\r\nwould have done under normal conditions. And even if he could have\r\nforgotten it, the frequent humiliations experienced in his youth, and\r\nin later years the perpetual allusions to his nationality made both by\r\nhis opponents and his champions, would have constantly reminded him of\r\nit. With reference to these perpetual allusions he writes in _Briefe\r\naus Paris_ (Feb. 7, 1832): \"It is like a miracle! The thing is always\r\nhappening, and yet is always new to me. One set of people reproach me\r\nwith being a Jew; another set forgive me for it; a third go the length\r\nof praising me for it; but they one and all think of it. It is as if\r\nthey had been conjured into this magic Jewish circle; none of them can\r\nget clear of it. And I know quite well what is the evil spell. These\r\npoor Germans! They live in the basement, weighed down by seven stories\r\nof higher ranks, and it eases their perturbed minds to talk of human\r\nbeings who live even lower down than they do, right down in the cellar.\r\nThe fact that they are not Jews consoles them for not even being\r\ncourt-councillors (_Hofräthe_).\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot, however, be asserted that Börne was peculiarly sensitive\r\non the subject of his Jewish extraction. He often declaimed with\r\nthe greatest indignation against the oppression of the unfortunate\r\ninhabitants of the Ghettos, but he could not do what many expected\r\nof him, could not advocate the emancipation of the Jews with greater\r\nwarmth than other kindred causes. A pursuit of liberty with only that\r\nend in view he looked upon as one-sided and egoistic.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Jews inspired him with a feeling of dissatisfaction,\r\nof aversion, originating in the antipathy which Frankfort commerce,\r\nconsisting chiefly in banking business, early awoke in the born poet\r\nand idealist. It horrified him to hear a Frankfort merchant speak with\r\nthe same enthusiasm and ardour of Rothschild or the Austrian loan, with\r\nwhich \"a lover of art would speak of a Raphael.\" In 1822 he wrote: \"My\r\naversion from traders and Jews, as such, has reached a climax, now that\r\nI have got away from Frankfort, and see what it really means to enjoy\r\nlife.\" Börne was by no means incapable of appreciating great commercial\r\nundertakings from the æsthetic as well as the practical point of view.\r\nNot many years later, the exchange and the harbour of Hamburg excite\r\nhis lively admiration. But the Frankfort merchants, Rothschild among\r\nthem, appeared to him, with their speculations in government stock, to\r\nbe connected with what he abhorred above everything--the dismembered\r\nstate of Germany and the Metternichian principles. His writings abound\r\nin thrusts at \"the ennobled German Jews, who are on terms of the most\r\nfamiliar intimacy with all the ministers and royal mistresses,\" and\r\nin consequence look with complete indifference on the Poles' struggle\r\nfor liberty. Rothschild especially is to him the symbol of evil: \"The\r\ngovernment could not be more despicable if Rothschild the Jew were\r\nking, and had formed a ministry of bill-brokers.... Rothschild will\r\nstand till the last day of kings. What a day of reckoning! what a\r\ncrash!\" In his bitter hatred of him he goes so far as to call it a\r\ndisgrace to the Jewish nation when Rothschild is sentenced in Paris to\r\ntwo days' imprisonment for declining, in spite of repeated warnings,\r\nto have his cabriolet numbered. Börne had, of course, no personal\r\nenmity to the man, but he detests him as \"the great broker of all those\r\nState loans which give monarchs the power to defy liberty.\" Being\r\nfirmly persuaded, after the Revolution of July, that another great\r\nrevolution was close at hand, he mistakenly considers it stupid of the\r\nJews to curry favour with those in power throughout Europe. But he is\r\nright when he calls them \"stupider than cattle\" for imagining that in\r\nthe event of a threatening revolution they will be protected by the\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nWith sound political judgment he perceives, what events in Russia have\r\nconfirmed, that it is exactly at such a time that those in power will\r\ndeliver them up to the tender mercies of popular hatred in order to\r\nescape themselves.[4]\r\n\r\nThe fact of Börne's being born without the pale of Christian society\r\ndid not produce in him any excessive sympathy with his co-religionists;\r\nbut the severe discipline of his joyless childhood, the coldness of his\r\nparents, the aversion aroused in him by the cupidity, cowardly caution,\r\nand other vices generated by oppression which he observed in those\r\naround him, all contributed to forge a spirit that could never be bent,\r\nsoftened, or broken--a character on whose adamantine firmness neither\r\nflattery nor threats made the smallest impression. The severity of this\r\ncharacter of ermine-white purity, a severity born of the burning love\r\nof justice, at times clad itself in the garment of humorous irony, at\r\ntimes in that of scathing ire. As a writer Börne was for Germany much\r\nwhat Paul Louis Courier was for France, that is to say, a political\r\ntribune, as satirical and as liberty-loving as the Frenchman, less\r\nclear-sighted in matters of the day, but with more feeling, more\r\nimagination, an all-round richer nature.[5]\r\n\r\nFor in Börne's case firmness of character did not preclude gentleness\r\nof disposition. The weak, always rather sickly boy, who grew up\r\nin a sunless street, shut off from fresh air and from nature, was\r\ntender-hearted. The germ of tenderness in his nature was perhaps first\r\ndeveloped by reading that German author who exercised most influence\r\non the formation of his opinions and his style--Jean Paul. It is from\r\nJean Paul, his best comforter in the dark days of his youth, that\r\nBörne, the author, is directly descended.\r\n\r\nTo him Jean Paul was the poet of those who are born in obscurity. He\r\nloved him as the spokesman of those who suffer wrong. He saw in him\r\na priest of justice, an apostle of mercy. His famous commemorative\r\noration gives us some idea of his youthful enthusiasm, and at the same\r\ntime shows what it was in Jean Paul's style that he endeavoured to\r\nmake his own. Real emotion makes itself felt through the artificial\r\nantitheses in such a passage as this:--\r\n\r\n\"We will sorrow for him whom we have lost, and for those who have not\r\nlost him. For he did not live for all. But the time is coming when he\r\nwill be born for all, and then all will mourn for him. He stands with\r\na patient smile at the gates of the twentieth century, waiting till\r\nhis lagging people overtake him. Then he will lead the tired and the\r\nfamishing into his city of love.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there is clever character-drawing in such lines as the following:--\r\n\r\n\"In countries the towns only are counted; in towns, only the towers,\r\nthe temples, and the palaces; in houses, their masters; in nations,\r\nparties; and in parties, their leaders.... By narrow, overgrown paths\r\nJean Paul sought out the neglected village. In the nation he counted\r\nthe human beings, in towns the house-roofs, and under every roof each\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\nIt was possibly Jean Paul's political attitude which first brought\r\nBörne under his spell. Jean Paul early took his place in German\r\nliterature as the inheritor of Herder's cosmopolitan sentiments and\r\ndoctrines. Herder had persistently exalted love of humanity, at the\r\nexpense of patriotism and national antipathy. Jean Paul continued\r\nto proclaim the common brotherhood of man. All his writings were,\r\nmoreover, pervaded by a general spirit of political liberalism,\r\nresembling that formulated in the Declaration of the Rights of Man,\r\nwhich had electrified him; and he treats of sovereigns, courts, and\r\nthe great world generally, in a tone of sustained irony. At times he\r\nregards as close at hand a coming golden age, in which it will no\r\nlonger be possible for nations, but only for individuals, to sin, and\r\nfrom which the spectre of war shall have disappeared; at other times\r\nhe relegates it to a very far off future; but the rapidity of what was\r\nand is called _historic progress_ induced both him and his disciple to\r\nimagine that universal brotherhood was not very distant.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not only his grand conception of the future that made\r\nJean Paul so attractive to Börne, but also the idyllic and satiric\r\nqualities of his talent. Börne adopted some of his comical names of\r\nplaces (_Kuhschnappel Flachsenfingen_), and as a young man imitated\r\nhis humorous style. Many of the short tales and sketches contributed\r\nto periodical literature--the comic _Esskünstler am Hoteltisch,\r\nAllerhochstdieselben, Hof- und Commerzienräthe, Die Thurn und Taxissche\r\nPost_ (the postal system of the day), &c. &c.--are in Jean Paul's\r\nmanner, though Börne keeps closer to reality both in his facts and\r\nhis local colouring than Jean Paul does. Börne attacks State, Church,\r\nexecutive, manners, and customs in Jean Pauls farcical fashion; but he\r\nhas not his predecessor's stores of observation to fall back on, and\r\ndoes not approach him in variety of knowledge.\r\n\r\nBy way of compensation, his style is in many ways superior to Jean\r\nPaul's.\r\n\r\nBörne, who was not gifted with any profound artistic feeling, or\r\ndelicate appreciation of style, admired the inartistic in Jean Paul\r\nas being unartificial. He did not feel that the profusion of imagery\r\nwas collected from here, there, and everywhere, and was seldom the\r\nnatural outgrowth of the subject it adorned. That Oriental wealth of\r\nsimile, that flowery luxuriance of language, pleased his taste as being\r\npoetical; and the want of harmony in the periods, the heavy ballast of\r\nthe innumerable parenthetic clauses, were to his ear only evidences of\r\nthe naturalness of the style. To him, too, Goethe's plastic art was\r\nonly coldness, while the impersonal style of Goethe's old age was a\r\nhorror. When he read Jean Paul's works, the living, restless ego in\r\nthem came forth to meet his own warm-hearted, passionate ego.\r\n\r\nHe unconsciously remoulded Jean Paul's style on the lines of his\r\nown individuality, that individuality which discloses itself in his\r\nearliest letters, and whose distinguishing traits were modified or\r\ndeveloped, but never altered. There were no wildernesses, no primeval\r\nforests in his mind, as there were in Jean Paul's. He did not think\r\nof ten things at a time, all inextricably entwined. No; in his case\r\nboth fancy and reasoning-power were clear, and concise in expression.\r\nHis acquaintance with Johannes von Müller's works early produced a\r\npropensity for pithy, Tacitus-like brevity. From the first there was\r\na half French, half Jewish tendency to antitheses and contrast in his\r\nstyle. He loved symmetry of thought and symmetry of language; his\r\nspiritual _tempo_ was quick; as a writer he was short-winded. Hence\r\nshort, sharp, strong sentences following each other at a gallop; no\r\nrounded periods. Metaphors abound; yet they are not so numerous as to\r\njostle each other out of place, and all are apt and suggestive; he\r\ndid not ransack note-books for them, like Jean Paul; they presented\r\nthemselves in modest abundance. He employed similes freely; but in\r\nhis clear-headed fashion he arranged them almost algebraically in his\r\nsentences, so that they produce the effect rather of equations than of\r\nscattered flowers.\r\n\r\nBy degrees his decidedly marked individuality took shape in a decidedly\r\nindividual humorous style. Jean Paul's humour spreads itself throughout\r\nlengthy and discursive investigations, narratives, romances; not so\r\nBörne's. He was never able to produce a political, poetical, critical,\r\nor historical work of any length; he could not write books, only pages.\r\nHis was an essentially journalistic talent.[6] And this determines the\r\ncharacter of his humour.\r\n\r\nPlayful humour was his, but also that sarcastic wit which stings like\r\na lash, and yet thrills and touches by an indirect appeal to the\r\nfeelings; his that bitterness of complaint and accusation which assumes\r\nthe conciliatory form of an attempt to comfort; and that melancholy,\r\nwhich with a smile and a whimsical conceit rises above time and place.\r\nBut something similar to this might be said of other great humorists.\r\nWhat distinguishes Börne (from Sterne, Jean Paul, and others) is, in\r\nthe first place, the strength, the violence of the reaction produced in\r\nhim by all the occurrences of the day which came within the bounds of\r\nhis horizon. A comparatively trifling incident in real, and especially\r\nin public, life is sufficient to set all the chords of his being in\r\nvibration. The second peculiarity is that all occurrences directly\r\nact upon one and the same point in his spiritual life, that passion\r\nfor liberty which was born of the keenest sense of justice. One of\r\nhis critics, Steinthal, explains in a masterly manner the connection\r\nbetween this fact and the fact of his inability to produce a great\r\nwork. He never thought systematically, never combined with each other\r\nall the many things that one after the other occupied and affected\r\nhis mind, but looked on each separately in its relation to the centre\r\npoint of his being.[7] His humour brought the miserable reality into\r\njuxtaposition with the ideal demand of his intellect; but he gave no\r\npicture of the different elements of reality, he merely focussed them.\r\n\r\nGiven such a state of matters, it is easy to understand how inevitable\r\nit was, not only that Börne should place Schiller high above Goethe,\r\nbut also that he should consider Jean Paul to be greatly Schiller's\r\nsuperior. And it is highly characteristic that what he objects to in\r\nSchiller is not his purely poetical shortcomings, but his want of moral\r\nidealism. We are accustomed to think of Schiller as unassailable on\r\nthis point, but to Börne's ruthless severity of moral requirement he\r\nis not so. Börne's pronouncement on the character of Wilhelm Tell is\r\nespecially enlightening. To him Tell is nothing but a Philistine--\r\na good citizen, father, and husband, but a man the essence of whose\r\ncharacter is submissiveness. He did not appear at the Rüth, that\r\nmeeting-place of the elect, to take the oath; he had not the courage to\r\nbe a conspirator. His words:\r\n\r\n\"Der Starke ist am mächtigsten _allein_\"--\r\n(The strong man is strongest alone)\r\n\r\nare to Börne the philosophy of weakness; a man who has only the\r\nstrength necessary to get the better of himself, is strongest alone,\r\nbut he that has strength to spare after gaining the mastery over\r\nhimself, will rule others also. The critic reviews Tell's actions one\r\nby one. Tell does not uncover to the hat on the pole, but his is not\r\nthe noble defiance of the lover of liberty; it is only Philistine\r\npride, a mixture of a sense of honour with fear; he passes the pole\r\nwith his eyes cast down, that he may be able to say he has not seen it.\r\nAnd when Gessler calls him to account, he is humble--so humble that we\r\nare ashamed of him; he says the omission was accidental, and shall not\r\noccur again.\r\n\r\nThe famous apple incident arouses no admiration in Börne. A father\r\nmay dare everything for his child's life, but he has no right to\r\nhazard that life. Why did Tell not shoot the tyrant at once instead\r\nof beseeching like a woman with his reiterated \"Lieber Herr! lieber\r\nHerr!\"? He deserved to have his ears boxed. And when the governor, in\r\nthe storm on the lake, trusted himself to him, as enemy trusts enemy,\r\nwas it not treachery and a knavish trick on Tell's part to leap on\r\nshore, push the boat out into the lake and leave him to the mercy of\r\nthe storm? Börne finds strong cause of offence in the speech:\r\n\r\n   \"Ich aber sprach: Ja, Herr mit Gottes Hilfe\r\n    Getrau ich mir's, und helf uns wohl hindannen.\r\n    So ward ich meiner Bande los und stand\r\n    Am Steuerruder und _fuhr redlich hin._\"[8]\r\n\r\n\"How,\" exclaims the critic, \"are we to explain such Jesuitry in the\r\nsimple-minded man? It is inconceivable to me, too, that any one can\r\nconsider Tell's next action moral, much less beautiful--he lies in\r\nsafe ambush, and kills his enemy, who has no idea that he is in danger.\"\r\n\r\nNo one can be surprised that a man in whose spiritual organism the\r\nsense of justice was so sharply, so intensely developed that it almost\r\ntook the place of the æsthetic sense, should be wanting in the organ\r\nof appreciation for Goethe, whose craving for justice was undoubtedly\r\nless developed.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, after one or two years' residence with a professor at Giessen,\r\nyoung Börne was sent to Berlin, his father being obliged to give in\r\nto his desire to study, although on account of his religion this\r\ncould only lead to his becoming a doctor, a profession for which as\r\nyet he showed no turn whatever. He boarded in the house of the famous\r\nphysician and Kantian, Marcus Herz, whose public lectures on philosophy\r\nhad drawn such crowded and influential audiences, that the appointment\r\nof Professor of Philosophy was conferred on him before any University\r\nof Berlin existed. Herz was an eminent physician, a clear thinker, and\r\na good orator; a friend of Lessing, whose poetry he valued as highly as\r\nhis critical writings. Hence the mysticism of the Romantic school, more\r\nespecially Hardenberg's, was to him both meaningless and obnoxious.\r\nAs he died in 1803, his influence on young Börne's development was\r\ninconsiderable. All the more powerful was the impression made on the\r\nyouth by Herz's famous wife, Henriette, _née_ Lemos. She was seventeen\r\nyears younger than her husband, to whom she was betrothed, without\r\nher consent being asked, at the age of twelve. Remarkably beautiful,\r\nmistress of many languages, admired by numbers of the most eminent\r\nscientific men and authors of the day, she made her house one of the\r\nmost frequented, most talked of, most looked up to in Berlin. She was\r\nthirty-eight, Börne sixteen, but this naturally did not prevent the\r\nyoung man from at once falling violently, though hopelessly, in love\r\nwith the most beautiful, most distinguished woman it had been his lot\r\nto meet.\r\n\r\nThe charming Henriette presented in outward appearance, as well as in\r\ncharacter, a marked contrast to her little, clever, ugly husband; she\r\nwas a faultless beauty, tall and stately as Queen Louise, with the\r\nsmall head we see on Greek statues. She went by the name of the Tragic\r\nMuse or the Beautiful Circassian. She was worshipped by Wilhelm von\r\nHumboldt, by Mirabeau, by Schleiermacher, and after her husband's death\r\nshe was surrounded by a bevy of men of position, who all wooed the fair\r\nwidow in vain. She refused all offers, in spite of her poverty rejected\r\neven the hand of the richest noblemen in Germany, and took the place of\r\ngoverness to the future Empress of Russia. She was as severely virtuous\r\nas she was intoxicatingly beautiful. She was on terms of intimacy with\r\nmore than one man, but always within the strict bounds of friendship.\r\n\r\nIn her circle a line was drawn between the admissible coquetry which\r\naims at enthralling the whole man, and the inadmissible, which only\r\naims at enthralling his senses. She herself belonged to the dangerous\r\nclass of virtuous flirts. Of a passionless temperament and much\r\naddicted to sentimental moralising, she founded in her younger days a\r\n\"Tugendbund\" (league of virtue), in which Wilhelm von Humboldt played\r\nthe principal part, and of which old and young, known and unknown men,\r\nwere members. They called each other Thou, wrote long letters to each\r\nother in foreign languages or in Greek or Hebrew characters, exchanged\r\nrings or silhouettes, aimed at each other's \"moral development,\"\r\ndesired \"to attain happiness by self-devotion\" (unencumbered by\r\nduties, for self-devotion knows no duties), and ignored the rules and\r\nregulations of conventional propriety--but in all chastity and honour.\r\nRahel laughed at them, and would have nothing to do with the league.\r\n\r\nThe letters the members of the league exchanged bear a strong\r\nresemblance to those which passed a little later in Denmark between\r\nKamma Rahbek and Molbech. They were absorbed in their own feelings,\r\nbut in constant self-examination, thereby naturally depriving their\r\nfeelings of all freshness. Friends of different sexes explained to\r\neach other in interminable letters, with written tears, how they\r\nmutually supplemented and developed one another. They tore themselves\r\nup into lint, and contemplated themselves in this unravelled condition;\r\nthey did not collect themselves for each other's benefit, but spun\r\nthemselves out. They put their inner man under pressure till the\r\nresult was a liquid--tears, heart's blood, or such like--and this\r\nthey poured into the bosom of a like-minded friend, without themselves\r\nbecoming in any way more remarkable or original under this treatment.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful and noble Henriette Herz herself was less an original\r\npersonality than what the Germans call an \"Anempfinderin.\" From the\r\nremarkable men with whom she came in contact, she seldom assimilated\r\nmore than what she picked up from a surface knowledge of their ways\r\nand doings. What brought her particularly into notice was the tender\r\nfriendship existing between her and Schleiermacher. It was much talked\r\nabout in Berlin, but with no insinuation of evil. The contrast was too\r\nstriking between the \"Tragic Muse\" and little Schleiermacher, whose\r\ndistinguished head was set upon a fragile, slightly deformed body.\r\nPeople smiled good-naturedly when they saw the little pastor coming\r\nout of Henriettas house in the evening with a lantern fastened to the\r\nbutton of his coat, or when they met him in the daytime hanging on the\r\narm of his majestic Melpomene. A caricature appeared, in which she was\r\nrepresented carrying him--the jewel, as he was called--in her hand,\r\nlike a parasol.[9]\r\n\r\nEven if young Börne had been the fresh, red-cheeked youth he was\r\nnot, he would hardly have made much impression on his proud, spoiled\r\nfoster-mother. At first she did not even understand what was the matter\r\nwith the young man, whose passion--described in his own memoranda\r\nwas a real school-boy worship, of the kind produced at his age by\r\nhalf-conscious instinct and exaggerated ideas of the perfection of\r\nwoman. One or two attempts which he made, through the medium of the\r\nservant, to procure arsenic from an apothecary's, opened Henriette\r\nHerz's eyes to the position, and she did her best, by an admixture\r\nof kindness with strictness, to bring him to reason.[10] That she was\r\nnot quite insensible to his adoration, or quite innocent of a certain\r\namount of coquetry, which masqueraded in this case as motherliness,\r\nis shown by the following little incident. Börne had taken her to be\r\nbetween twenty-eight and thirty, but at the dinner-table, on the 3rd of\r\nDecember 1802, she told him that she was thirty-four. In the evening\r\nshe added two to this figure, but she never acknowledged more than\r\nthe thirty-six, and on the 5th of March 1803, Börne still supposes\r\nthis to be her age. So the charming \"Frau Mutter,\" as she allowed him\r\nto call her, made herself two years younger than she was. Naturally\r\nhe continued to love, to admire, to despair, to suffer the pangs of\r\nhell because of her indifference, and to feel the bliss of heaven when\r\nshe smiled at him or said a friendly word; also to be so suspicious,\r\nbitter, unreasonable, and capricious that at last it became necessary\r\nto send him away.\r\n\r\nHe went to Halle to continue his studies there. As he was leaving he\r\nhanded her the diary of his emotions--she had, it seems, advised\r\nhim to pour forth his sorrows on paper--and a number of passionate\r\nletters addressed to herself. He continued to write to her from Halle\r\nwith unchangeable devotion and passionate longing, but in absence he\r\nsoon so far recovers himself as no longer to be entirely absorbed\r\nin the sifting of his own feelings; we presently have calm and\r\nentertaining criticism of his surroundings, and a certain dignified\r\nself-esteem, combined with self-criticism. In these letters we already\r\nnotice the characteristic combination of enthusiasm for ideas,\r\nindignant denunciation of slavishness, and sharp satire. They give\r\nus an understanding of Börne's real nature--a temperament to which\r\nlicentiousness presents as little temptation as does drink, a soul that\r\nsuffers under weakness of body, suffers from the inward conflict that\r\nensues where there is courage without power, love that meets no return,\r\nundefined longing to do great deeds without any definite aim. Here and\r\nthere we come upon a threat of what, when once his powers are matured,\r\nawaits the Philistine crowd that now smile at him--upon a wrathful\r\npresentiment of future humiliations, and fiery projects of revenge on\r\nthose who, as he already knows, will shamelessly revile him because of\r\nhis birth, and torture him by calling his reserve cowardice.[11]\r\nIt is plain that one result of young Börne's stay in Berlin has been\r\nthe maturing of his emotional life, and also that his intellectual\r\npowers have been stimulated by his being brought into contact, in\r\nMarcus and Henriette Herz's house, with the most eminent men of the day.\r\n\r\nBörne was studying at Halle when the battle of Jena was fought. Shortly\r\nafterwards that university was suppressed by Napoleon, and he went to\r\npursue his studies at Heidelberg, full of patriotic rancour against the\r\nFrench, to which he gave vent in a pamphlet which the censor refused\r\nto pass. Whilst one result of Napoleon's triumphal progress was the\r\nexpulsion of the students from Halle, another was a complete revolution\r\nin the political conditions of Börne's native town. In 1806 Dalberg,\r\nas \"Prince-Primas\" of the newly formed Rhenish Confederation, took\r\npossession of Frankfort-on-Main. One of his first acts was to improve\r\nthe position of the Jews, and in 1810 Napoleon issued an ordinance\r\nremoving all burdens resting upon them and upon serfs. In 1811 the\r\nJewish community in Frankfort received the full rights of citizens,\r\nin consideration of a sum of 440,000 guldens, which was paid up by\r\nthe following year. The first result of all this, as far as Börne was\r\nconcerned, was that he gave up the study of medicine, which he had\r\ntaken to unwillingly, and only because he was debarred from every\r\nother, and entered on that of political economy and jurisprudence, as\r\nopening the way to a government appointment. In 1818 he took the degree\r\nof Doctor of Philosophy.\r\n\r\nHis father, who had been extremely dissatisfied with his want of\r\napplication as a student, and with being constantly called on to\r\npay small debts, and who was now no less dissatisfied with him for\r\nthrowing up the study of medicine, insisted that he should begin to\r\nsupport himself, and procured for him a small post in the Frankfort\r\npolice establishment, an appointment which contrasts comically with the\r\nposition which he afterwards took as an author.\r\n\r\nHe was appointed \"Aktuarius,\" sat in the old, dark Römer building,\r\nexamined passports and journeymen's certificates, entered minutes, and\r\non state occasions, dressed in uniform and wearing a sword, represented\r\nlocal authority.\r\n\r\nBut he had also by this time made his _début_ as a writer. He\r\ncontributed to a Frankfort daily paper articles crammed with primeval\r\nGerman rhetoric, defying the mighty Corsican with a patriotic\r\nenthusiasm which he at times allows to run away with common sense. They\r\nare appeals to the youth of Germany, and passionate expressions of\r\nblind, loyal faith in the rulers of Germany.[12] He is absolutely\r\nhopeful of the result of \"the war of liberation.\"\r\n\r\nHe had no foreboding that he himself would be one of the first victims\r\nof victory. Hardly had the Emperors of Russia and Austria and the King\r\nof Prussia entered Frankfort, when the seven years' rule of Prince\r\nDalberg came to an end. The Grand Duchy of Frankfort was blotted from\r\nthe list of States, and the old constitution came into force again. The\r\ncitizenship which the Jews had acquired at such a high price was simply\r\ntaken from them again, of course without the return of the money. \"It\r\nwas,\" writes Karl Gutzkow, \"as if the couriers who rushed back and\r\nforwards between Vienna, where the Peace Congress was sitting, and\r\nthe other German towns where reactionary congresses were being held,\r\ntore furrows in the blood-manured soil of Germany, in which the ruling\r\npowers dared to sow the seed of the old prejudices and privileges.\"\r\n\r\nThe fall of the French power deprived Börne of his appointment, and his\r\nbrothers in misfortune of their rights as men; he was impersonal enough\r\nin his way of looking at things to consider the foreign rule a disgrace\r\nfrom first to last.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Goethe's indifference to this, as to other\r\nresults of the great reaction, strengthened Börne's hatred for a\r\npersonality that appeared great upon no side accessible to him. In\r\nhis notice of Bettina's book, _Goethe's Briefwechsel mit einem Kinde_\r\n(\"Goethe's Correspondence with a Child\")--perhaps the most misleading\r\ncriticism he ever wrote--Börne says: \"What made Goethe, that greatest\r\nof poets, the smallest of men? What entwined hops and parsley in his\r\nwreath of laurel? What set a night-cap on his lofty brow? What made him\r\na slave of circumstances, a cowardly Philistine, a mere provincial?\r\nHe was a Protestant, and his family belonged to the ruling class in\r\nFrankfort, from among whom its senators were chosen. At the age of\r\nsixty, at the zenith of his fame, with the incense-clouds under his\r\nfeet separating and sheltering him from the base passions of the\r\nvalley-dweller, it angered him to hear that the Frankfort Jews demanded\r\nthe rights of citizens, and he foamed with rage at the 'humanitarian\r\ntwaddlers' who championed their cause.\"\r\n\r\nIt was his relations with the great ones of the earth that Börne could\r\nleast of all forgive Goethe.\r\n\r\nHe overlooked the fact that the generation that lay between him and\r\nGoethe meant a complete change in the position of the author towards\r\nmen of rank and the public generally. In Germany in the eighteenth\r\ncentury authors did not live on their works, but on their dedications.\r\nPoets were obliged to seek the favour of a high-born patron, to educate\r\nyoung noblemen, or accompany young princes on their educational tours.\r\nWieland accepted money in return for his dedications; Schiller gladly\r\naccepted the assistance which the Duke of Augustenburg procured for him\r\nfrom Denmark. In the end of the eighteenth century, kings, princes,\r\nand the aristocracy generally, took a true and keen interest in\r\nphilosophy and poetry, in all the new truth and beauty; they sought the\r\nacquaintance of authors, and associated with them as with their equals.\r\nWith the French Revolution these admirable relations came to an end,\r\nbut Goethe's position dated from before the Revolution.\r\n\r\nBörne blinded himself with gazing at disconnected expressions of\r\nGoethe's veneration for rank. Somewhere or other he copies this passage\r\nfrom Goethe's diary: \"I afterwards had the unexpected happiness of\r\nbeing permitted to pay my homage to their Imperial Highnesses the\r\nGrand Duke Nicholas and his consort, in my own house and garden. The\r\nGrand Duchess graciously allowed me to write some lines of poetry\r\nin her elegantly splendid album.\" Börne adds: \"This he wrote in his\r\nseventy-first year. What youthful power!\" The older Börne grew, and\r\nthe more he developed, by his own conscious volition, into a simple\r\nincarnation of political conviction, into a being of whose feelings,\r\ntalents, and wit political conviction had taken possession, to whom it\r\nhad become a religion, with all the outward expressions of religion,\r\nfaith, worship, fanaticism--the more unworthy and contemptible did\r\nGoethe's rôle of spectator of the political struggles of the day\r\nappear to him. Elsewhere he writes: \"I have finished Goethe's journal.\r\nNo drier or more lifeless soul exists in the wide world, and nothing\r\ncan be more comical than the simplicity with which he lays bare his\r\nown callousness.... And these are the consuls chosen by the German\r\npeople--Goethe, who, more timid than a mouse, burrows in the ground,\r\nand gladly dispenses with light, air, liberty, everything, so long\r\nas he is left in peace in his hole gnawing at his stolen bacon; and\r\nSchiller, more noble, but equally faint-hearted, who seeks refuge\r\nfrom tyranny above the clouds, where he vainly cries to the gods for\r\naid, and, dazzled by the sun, loses sight of the earth, and forgets\r\nthe human beings whom he intended to help. And meanwhile the unhappy\r\ncountry, without leaders, without guardians, without advisers, without\r\nprotectors, falls a prey to its kings, and the nation becomes a byeword\r\namong nations.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the summer of 1818 onwards, Börne, who till then had only\r\npublished an occasional pamphlet, appears as an independent journalist,\r\npublisher of the _Die Wage_ (\"The Balance\"), most of the articles in\r\nwhich he wrote himself. He was the first German journalist in the\r\ngrand style, and first to make the periodical press of Germany a\r\npower. The possessors of the now rare numbers of that old epoch-making\r\nmagazine \"of politics, science, and art,\" look on them as treasures.\r\nIts success is to be ascribed to its publisher and chief contributor's\r\nlively style and apt wit. It treated of politics, literature, and the\r\ndrama, and had on its staff men like Görres (before his conversion) and\r\nWillemer, Goethe's rationalistic, liberal-minded friend (\"Suleika's\"\r\nhusband); but whatever the subject under treatment might be, it took\r\na political colouring from the manner in which it was approached. For\r\nthree months of the four years during which Börne continued to publish\r\n_Die Wage_, he was also editor of the daily newspaper, _Zeitung der\r\nfreien Stadt Frankfurt_, a position he had to give up because of the\r\nconstant annoyance to which he was subjected by the censorship. He\r\nafterwards edited another daily paper, _Die Zeitschwingen_; but this\r\nwas suppressed, and its editor sentenced to a short imprisonment. Börne\r\nnow paid his first visit to Paris, whence he for a time wrote letters\r\nfor Cotta's various periodical publications; but by 1822 he was again\r\nin Germany, where a long and dangerous illness soon swallowed up all\r\nhis savings, and compelled him to apply to his father for assistance.\r\n\r\nHis father was exceedingly dissatisfied with him. All his other\r\nchildren did him credit, he said; but this son, now unable to support\r\nhimself, had had a most expensive education, and what was there to show\r\nfor it? He could do nothing but write articles with a tendency highly\r\ndisapproved of by his (the father's) patron, Prince Metternich, in\r\nVienna. What was the good of making enemies for himself? of attacking\r\nthe great? Was it becoming in his position of life? What position,\r\nindeed, did he suppose himself to occupy, seeing he allowed himself\r\nsuch liberty of speech? By this time he might have been a doctor in\r\ngood practice, or a barrister, and counsel for Rothschild; instead of\r\nwhich he elected to be a hack writer for periodicals, spending the\r\ntrifle he got for his articles on travelling, and closing every avenue\r\nto success by his impious attacks on those in authority.\r\n\r\nAnd Börne's father had sufficient political sagacity to be aware\r\nthat it was quite unnecessary for his son to be either a doctor or\r\nan advocate in order to find lucrative employment. He knew very well\r\nwhere Herr von Gentz's and Herr Friedrich von Schlegel's bank-drafts\r\ncame from. And besides, had not his son Maria Theresa's promise to fall\r\nback on?[13]\r\n\r\nFrom the very commencement of Börne's career as a journalist, his\r\ntalent had attracted the attention of the great reactionaries. On the\r\n18th of May 1819, Rahel writes that Gentz has recommended _Die Wage_ to\r\nher, as containing the cleverest, wittiest writing of the day, the best\r\nof its kind since Lessing's time. Börne's father was perfectly aware\r\nthat Herr von Gentz praised his son's style, and Prince Metternich\r\nhis grasp of politics.[14] So he privately set to work to secure an\r\nadvantageous sphere of operation for him on the sunny side of society.\r\nBefore young Börne was told anything about it, Metternich had eagerly\r\ncome forward with the most liberal proposals: The young man was to\r\nlive in Vienna with the title, position, and emoluments of an Imperial\r\nCouncillor (kaiserlicher Rath), and with no claim made on him for any\r\nservice in return. Everything he chose to write was to be entirely\r\nexempt from censorship; he should be his own censor. And if, in the\r\ncourse of a few months, he should elect to give up his appointment, he\r\nwas to be free to do so. In such a position he would have the very best\r\nopportunity of working for the cause of progress and humanity.\r\n\r\nHis father wrote: \"Dear Louis! I beg of you to read this letter as\r\ncarefully as I have read it. Believe me, the independence you prize so\r\nhighly is an uncertain possession; will you, can you retain it? Why\r\nshould not you, too, at last think of making a settled position for\r\nyourself?... On what is your present bliss founded? Surely not on the 500\r\nfrancs (Cotta's monthly payment)? Make up your mind, for the sake of\r\nyour future, to take a journey to Vienna at my expense; I beseech of\r\nyou not to throw away this chance of success....\"\r\n\r\nBörne refused everything point blank, refused to hold any communication\r\nwith those in power.[15] Goethe might allow himself to be appointed\r\nPrivy Councillor at a court, but he, Börne, would not. And yet the\r\ntemptation must have been greater in the case of the born plebeian,\r\nwho had had to take off his hat at the bidding of every passer-by,\r\nthan it was in the case of the great patrician. In reading the hard,\r\ncontemptuous, and unjust words which Börne wrote of Goethe, we must not\r\nforget that behind these words there was a man who would not do what\r\nGoethe did.\r\n\r\nBörne was devoid of artistic sense in the strict acceptation of the\r\nterm. He frankly confessed the fact himself, and, moreover, betrays it\r\nin his intolerance of those to whom it is a matter of indifference what\r\nthe artist represents, but all-important how he represents it. Artists\r\nand connoisseurs of this type are utterly repugnant to him. It disgusts\r\nhim that any man can prefer a painting of still life to a painting of a\r\nMadonna. His natural bias towards the lofty, the sublime, the divine,\r\nleads him to demand these qualities in art, and to declare frankly\r\nthat all works of art in which these qualities are wanting, are to him\r\nsimply daubs or monstrosities.[16]\r\n\r\nWe cannot agree with Steinthal when he says that Börne was at home in\r\nevery domain of culture, every sphere of artistic production; for that\r\nvery branch of art to which the name art is more specially applied, was\r\na sealed book to him. This naturally did not prevent his writing much\r\nthat is sensible and instructive about works of art; but what he wrote\r\nis not art criticism.\r\n\r\nBörne has been often and much praised for his energetic condemnation\r\nof the German fatalistic tragedies (_Schicksalstragödien_) which\r\nbegan in his day to take possession of the stage and to confuse men's\r\nminds. But it is to be observed that it is not as æsthetically\r\nreprehensible that he objects to them; he looks at the matter from\r\nthe moral or religious point of view. The belief that a certain date,\r\nsay the 24th of February, is peculiarly fraught with fate for any\r\nfamily, is stupid and futile. It has no connection whatever either\r\nwith the belief of the ancients in an inevitable, pre-ordained fate,\r\nor with the Christian belief in an omniscient Providence, or with the\r\nmodern determinist theory of cause and effect, which has undermined\r\nthe earlier belief in so-called freewill. But to Börne the belief in\r\nquestion is an unreasonable one only because it is a confusion of two\r\ntheological systems. His chain of reasoning is this: death is either\r\na loving father, who takes his child home, in which case fate is not\r\ntragic, or a Kronos, who devours his own children, in which case it is\r\nunchristian.[17] As if that were any objection! It might still be\r\nextremely poetical.\r\n\r\nBörne is so clever and clear-headed that his opinion as to the worth\r\nor worthlessness of the many dramas it falls to his lot to criticise\r\nis almost always correct. He thoroughly enters into the spirit of\r\nOehlenschläger's _Correggio_, and is full of indulgence for the\r\nweaknesses of the play, but quite oblivious to its scenic effect. He\r\nshows thorough appreciation of dramatists like Kleist and Immermann\r\nand young Grillparzer. But when he begins to give his reasons for\r\nblame or praise, the inartistic temperament invariably betrays itself,\r\nand he frequently displays all the many prejudices of the idealist.\r\nHe is undoubtedly justified in his unfavourable opinion of Inland's\r\n_Die Spieler_ (\"The Gamblers\"), for instance. But the justification he\r\noffers is most peculiar: \"What has gambling to do on the stage?\" he\r\ncries; \"one might as well dramatise consumption in all its different\r\nstages.\" There is only this difference, one would imagine, that\r\nconsumption is a physical ailment, gambling a vice. His position is one\r\nthat is characteristic of idealism, namely, that there is no need to\r\ngo to the theatre to see what we can see at home. He gives as examples\r\npoverty, debt, a faithful wife's patient endurance of hardships; and\r\ninstead of remarking on the dull, inartistic spirit in which such\r\nthings are represented, he exclaims: \"Are these such rare sights that\r\nwe should pay money to see them? On the stage, humanity ought to be\r\nraised a step above its common level.\" And he goes on to explain that\r\nit was for this reason the Greek and Roman tragedians had recourse\r\nto mythic fable, and to maintain that the modern dramatist ought to\r\nrepresent the real characters of ancient days; or, if nothing will\r\nserve him but to grapple with the present, that he must only venture\r\nto reproduce its passions. We perceive that Börne is possessed by the\r\nnaïve belief that the \"classic\" characters of olden times stood on a\r\nhigher level than the human beings of to-day; and that he does not\r\nunderstand how every-day reality, properly treated, can be refined into\r\nart.\r\n\r\nA still stronger proof than these academic utterances of Börne's\r\ninability to appreciate simple, primitive poetry, is his indifference\r\nto the Old Testament. In a letter to Henriette Herz, written in\r\nhis nineteenth year, we come upon a passage of absolutely alarming\r\nsterility, dry and senile as a joke on the Pentateuch by Voltaire--\r\nand this after Goethe: \"It has always appeared to me as if it had been\r\nthe intention of the old Jews, from Abraham down to Solomon the Wise,\r\nto parody the history of the world. Read Joshua or the Book of Kings,\r\nand you will at once be struck by their resemblance to Blumau.\"[18] A\r\ncomparison between these venerable compilations of memorable legends\r\nand historical events and a clumsy German parody of Virgil's _Æneid_\r\ncould only be instituted by a critic who, devoid of all appreciation\r\nof antique literary form, set himself to find in every work some\r\nmodern sentimental, religious, or political moral. It is quite of a\r\npiece with this that Börne should end by blindly admiring the vague,\r\nhalf Biblical, half modern unctuous pathos of Lamennais' _Paroles d'un\r\nCroyant._\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Hermann Grimm: _Goethe_.\r\n\r\n[2] Gutzkow: _Börne's Leben_.--M.

Werke, xii. 328, 329.\r\n\r\n[14] Metternich was even acquainted with the later, quite revolutionary\r\nletters from Paris. On the 26th of January 1834, Princess Melanie\r\nMetternich writes in her diary: \"I spent the early hours of the evening\r\nwith Clemens, to whom I read Börne's _Letters from Paris_. They are\r\nof course as malicious as possible, but the style, with its dæmonic\r\nextravagance, is remarkably clever.\" (Metternich's _Posthumous Papers_,\r\nv. 545, quoted by Holzmann.)\r\n\r\n[15] He writes to his father: \"Gentz, too, was doubtless a Liberal\r\nto begin with, but he could give securities for a sincere conversion\r\nwhich I cannot give. He had been sold to England for many years before\r\nhe took service with Austria. He is sensual, extravagant, the most\r\ndissolute man in the country.\"\r\n\r\n[16] \"A frog, a cucumber, a leg of mutton, a Wilhelm Meister, a\r\nChrist--it is all the same to them; they actually forgive a Madonna her\r\nholiness, if she is well painted. So am not I, and never was. In nature\r\nI have always sought God, God only, and in art the divine; and where I\r\ndid not find God, I saw nothing but miserable botch-work. History, men,\r\nand books I have judged in like manner--unfortunately!\"\r\n\r\n[17] \"I have never been able to understand their conception of fate,\r\ntheir confusion of the antique with the Romantic idea, their Christian\r\npaganism. Death is either a loving father, who comes to fetch his child\r\nhome from the school of life, in which case fate is not tragic; or he\r\nis the cannibal Kronos, who swallows his own children, in which case it\r\nis unchristian. Your fate is a hermaphrodite, unable either to beget or\r\nto bring forth.\"\r\n\r\n[18] _Briefe des jungen Börne,_ p. 143.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBÖRNE\r\n\r\n\r\nBut for this lack of poetic-artistic understanding, it would be\r\ndifficult to explain how Börne came to take the share he did in the\r\nreaction against Goethe which was set on foot by some of the leading\r\nmen of the day. For, though he had a quite individual, spontaneous\r\nanimosity to Goethe, Börne was certainly not the originator of the\r\nreaction, which was in full swing before he took any part in it. About\r\nthe time when the Pietists were gloating over Pastor Pustkuchen's\r\nparody of the _Wanderjahre_, with its attack on the impiety of Goethe,\r\nthe pagan, progressive, youthful politicians were beginning to\r\napprove of investigations into Goethe's political convictions, which\r\nmeasured them by the very latest standard and made him out to be an\r\n\"aristocrat,\" with no feeling for the people, and in reality with no\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nThe first writer of any note who perseveringly and fanatically devoted\r\nhimself to the systematic disparagement of Goethe was Wolfgang Menzel\r\n(born in 1798), a man who before the age of thirty had made his name\r\nfamous and feared by the help of a certain coarse literary ability,\r\ntremendous self-assurance, and the severity of his creed as a Liberal,\r\nNationalist, and moralist. Like Börne, he was originally a disciple of\r\nJean Paul. But his _Streckverse_ (1823), which were much admired in\r\ntheir day, and which are unmistakable imitations of that master, carry\r\nJean Paul's peculiar kind of humour to the verge of caricature. Things\r\nthat have no natural connection whatever with each other are forced\r\ninto juxtaposition to produce an aphorism, in much the same manner as\r\ntotally unconnected ideas are coupled together in a pun. He writes:\r\n\"All Saints' Day comes before All Souls'; the prophets reach heaven\r\nbefore the people.\" \"The religion of antiquity was the crystal-matrix\r\nof many resplendent gods; the Christian religion is the mother-of-pearl\r\nthat encloses one god only, but one beyond all price.\" \"This mortal\r\nlife is a bastinado.\" \"Every church bell is a diving-bell, beneath\r\nwhich the pearl of religion is found.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn his periodical, _Deutsche Litteratur_, he began, in 1819, an attack\r\nupon Goethe, which he carried on with insane conceit and immovable\r\nfaith in the justice of his cause. He first tried to undermine the\r\nadmiration of the reading world for Goethe's originality, examined\r\nhis works with the aim of discovering imitations or plagiarisms, and\r\ndemonstrated the existence of foreign influence everywhere throughout\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn his first connected work on the history of literature, _Die deutsche\r\nLitteratur_, which was published in 1828, in two parts, he calmly\r\naccuses Goethe of having flattered all the prejudices and vanities of\r\nhis time. He declares him to be possessed of nothing more than great\r\ndescriptive ability, great \"talent,\" which is a thing unattended by\r\ninward conviction, \"a hetaira, who is at every one's beck and call.\"\r\nGoethe has always, he declares, swum with the stream, and on its\r\nsurface, like a cork; he has ministered to every weakness and folly\r\nthat happened to be in fashion; under the fair mask of his works a\r\nrefinement of sensuality lies concealed; these works are the blossom\r\nof that materialism which prevails in the modern world. Goethe has no\r\ngenius, but a very high degree of \"the talent for making his readers\r\nhis accomplices,\" &c, &c.[2] Heine, who was uncritical enough in his\r\nreview of the book to praise both it and its author--praise which he\r\nwas soon to regret--would have nothing to say to Menzel's doctrine that\r\nGoethe's gift was not genius, only talent. He expresses the opinion\r\nthat this doctrine will be accepted by few, \"and even these few will\r\nconfess that Goethe at times had the talent to be a genius.\"[3]\r\n\r\nMenzel continued the cannonade in his numerous contributions to\r\nperiodicals, and in a new, very much enlarged, edition of his work\r\non German literature. He convicts Goethe of three distinct kinds of\r\npersonal vanity and six kinds of voluptuousness (\"dreierlei Eitelkeiten\r\nund sechserlei Wollüsteleien\"). He analyses his works, great and small,\r\none by one, measures them by his own patriotic standard, and declares\r\nthem to be despicable. _Clavigo_ he condemns, because Goethe makes\r\nClavigo desert Marie. That he afterwards makes him die by the hand\r\nof her brother goes for nothing, in fact is only an additional cause\r\nof offence to Menzel, who knows that in real life Clavigo lived on\r\nhappily, which make his death on the stage a mere _coup de théâtre._[4]\r\nTo find sufficient immorality in the play, the critic must,\r\nwe observe, take advantage of his knowledge of circumstances that\r\ndo not concern it. _Tasso_ is to him Goethe's _Höflingsbekenntniss_\r\n(\"Confessions of a Courtier\"), in which he betrays the vanity of\r\nthe _parvenu_, to whom the high rank of a woman is an irresistible\r\nattraction.[5] The reader will have no difficulty in imagining\r\nfor himself all the moral reflections for which Menzel finds occasion\r\nin _Die Mitschuldigen_, in _Die Geschwister_, where \"voluptuousness\r\ncasts sidelong glances at the pretty sister,\" in _Stella_, where it\r\ncraves the excitement of bigamy (\"nach dem Reiz der Bigamie gelüstet\")\r\nand in the _Mann von fünfzig Jahren_, which is the special object of\r\nhis indignation. Even _Wilhelm Meister_ is to Menzel only an expression\r\nof the shamefully light esteem in which Goethe held true virtue, and\r\nthe strong attraction which the outward conditions of rank possessed\r\nfor him.[6] _Die Wahlverwandschaften_ he regards as the type\r\nof \"the novel of adultery,\" which takes for its theme the desire of\r\nvoluptuousness after untried sensations (\"die Wollüstelei, die das\r\nFremde begehrt\"). _Die Braut von Korinth_ is simply the expression of\r\nthe voluptuousness whose desire is set on corpses, \"die sogar noch in\r\nden Schauern des Grabes, in der Buhlerei mit schönen Gespenstern einen\r\n_haut goût_ des Genusses findet\"--(which even amidst the horrors of\r\nthe grave finds a _haut goût_ of sensual enjoyment in intercourse with\r\nbeautiful spectres).\r\n\r\nWhere it is impossible to bring an accusation of immorality, Menzel\r\nreturns to his accusation of want of originality. It is not only its\r\nglorification of middle-class Philistinism that stamps _Hermann und\r\nDorothea_ as an inferior work, but also the direct imitation of Voss's\r\n_Luise_. According to Menzel, Goethe showed real originality only in\r\n_Faust_ and _Wilhelm Meister_, because in these two works he copied\r\nhimself. In his youth he borrowed from Moliere and Beaumarchais, from\r\nShakespeare and Lessing, and his later iambic tragedies are \"the fruits\r\nof his rivalry with Schiller.\" Added to all this, he was, God knows, no\r\npatriot.\r\n\r\nLet us compare Börne's attacks on Goethe with Menzel's, and we shall\r\nfind, in spite of similar extravagance of expression, this great\r\ndifference, that Börne does not attempt to judge, still less to condemn\r\nGoethe's great works, nor does he condescend to accusations of sexual\r\nimmorality; he invariably confines himself to attacking Goethe in his\r\npolitical relations. Saint-René Taillandier correctly observes that\r\nBörne gave expression to everything that was rankling in his heart when\r\nhe took as motto for his review of Bettina's _Goethe's Briefwechsel mit\r\neinem Kinde_ (\"Goethe's Correspondence with a Child\"), these words from\r\n_Prometheus_:\r\n\r\n   \"Ich dich ehren? Wofür?\r\n    Hast du die Schmerzen gelindert\r\n    Je des Beladenen?\r\n    Hast du die Thränen gestillet\r\n    Je des Geängsteten?\"[7]\r\n\r\nThough he could only appreciate those of Goethe's works in which the\r\nfire of youth was perceptible, his attacks are not based on contempt\r\nfor the other works, but on the fact that Goethe, so highly favoured in\r\nthe matter of ability and of social position, never thought of devoting\r\nthat ability, that position, to the improvement of the existing\r\nconditions of life in Germany. It is easy to cull foolish passages\r\nconceived in Menzel's strain from Börne's works. In his Journal of\r\n1830, for instance, he writes of Goethe's luck in having succeeded in\r\nimitating with his talent the handwriting of genius for sixty years\r\nwithout being detected; and in another place he calls Goethe the\r\nrhyming, Hegel the rhymeless, thrall.[8]  But to understand these wild and\r\nregrettable outbursts, we must make ourselves acquainted with Börne's\r\nbill of accusation against both Goethe and Schiller.\r\n\r\nHe started from the premise (in all probability quite a false one) that\r\nGoethe, by making timely and energetic protest, could have prevented\r\nthe Resolutions of Karlsbad, could have secured the liberty of the\r\npress and the other spiritual rights of which the reaction had deprived\r\nthe German nation. In any case, whatever the results might have been,\r\nhe was firmly convinced that it was Goethe's duty to have protested.\r\nInstead of this, what happens? \"Geheimrath von Goethe, the Karlsbad\r\npoet,\" as Börne, knowing that he goes there every year to drink the\r\nwaters, satirically nicknames him, subscribes himself _servant_ among\r\nother servants of his Prince (\"wir sämmtlichen Diener\"); confesses\r\nin his _Tag- und Jahres-Hefte_ that he wrote his stupid little play\r\n_Der Bürgergeneral_ (the whole plot of which hinges on the stealing\r\nof a pail of milk from the peasant Martin), with the intention of\r\nridiculing the French Revolution; also confesses that, far from taking\r\nFichte's part when that philosopher was accused of teaching atheism\r\nin the University of Jena, he was much annoyed at the vexation caused\r\nto the court by the outside interference which Fichte's utterances\r\nprovoked.[9] Another cause of offence was the way in which,\r\nwhen Oken's _Isis_ was published, Goethe bewailed the peaceful times\r\nbrought to an end by the establishment of the liberty of the press in\r\nWeimar, \"the further consequences of which every right-thinking man\r\nwith any knowledge of the world foresees with alarm and regret.\"[10]\r\nAnd the same feeling of disappointment and mortification was aroused in\r\nBörne when he read that Schiller, whom he highly esteemed, had at the\r\nvery crisis of the French Revolution declared in his announcement of\r\nthe new periodical _Die Horen_, that from this publication everything\r\nin the nature of criticism of the government, of religion, or of\r\nthe political questions of the day, would be expressly and strictly\r\nexcluded.[11]\r\n\r\nWe must bear all this in mind when we read Börne's flaming\r\ndenunciations--ablaze with a passion for liberty that forgets\r\nto be just--of Schiller and of Goethe, his lament that in their\r\ncorrespondence these two greatest minds of Germany show themselves\r\nso small that nothing at all would be better (\"so Nichts sind--nein\r\nweniger als Nichts, so wenig\"), and that they actually are what he,\r\nthe confirmed democrat, considers the worst thing possible, a pair of\r\nconfirmed aristocrats. He sees in Schiller a worse aristocrat than\r\nGoethe, for Goethe's partiality is merely for the upper classes of\r\nsociety, whereas Schiller will associate with none but the _élite_ of\r\nhumanity. It is Börne's belief that Goethe might have been the Hercules\r\nwho should cleanse the Augean stables of his country; but he rather\r\nelected to fetch the golden apples of the Hesperides, and to keep\r\nthem for himself.[12] He compares him in his own mind with the great\r\nproductive spirits of other countries; with Dante, who championed the\r\ncause of justice; with Alfieri, who preached liberty; with Montesquieu,\r\nwho wrote the _Lettres Persanes_; with Voltaire, who dared everything\r\nand gave up all his other occupations to assist a persecuted man, or to\r\nvindicate the memory of one who had been unjustly condemned to death;\r\nwith the republican Milton; with Byron, whose life was one struggle\r\nagainst tyranny, intelligent or unintelligent--and he summons him\r\nbefore the judgment seat of posterity. \"That terrible, incorruptible\r\njudge will say to Goethe: A mighty mind was given to thee, didst thou\r\never employ it to oppose baseness? Heaven gave thee a tongue of fire,\r\ndidst thou ever champion justice? Thou hadst a good sword, but it was\r\ndrawn to defend thyself alone.\"[13]\r\n\r\nWe cannot deny that Börne has pointed to real flaws in Goethe's\r\ngreatness, and to real limitations in his nature, even though we know\r\nthat some of his qualities were bought at the price of these defects,\r\nand that a certain limitation was inevitable if the many-sidedness of\r\nhis genius was not to be its bane. It was not for him to do what Börne\r\nrequired of him. Still we must understand the proportion of justice\r\nthere is in Börne's attacks, to be able to forgive him this violent\r\nand foolish expression of resentment against Goethe during those years\r\nwhen the hopes of the Liberals in the results of the Revolution of July\r\nwere receiving their double death-blow, from the subjection of the\r\nFrench Government to the power of the great financiers, and from the\r\nsuppression of the Polish revolt. He is now more bitter and violent\r\nthan ever. He calls Goethe a prodigious _obstructive_ power, compares\r\nhim to a cataract on the eye of Germany, and expresses the opinion that\r\nnot until the old man of Weimar dies will German liberty be born. (Nov.\r\n20, 1830.)[14]\r\n\r\nIt was on the 1st of October 1831, after whole days spent in despair\r\nover events which conveyed the impression, specially painful to\r\nthis obstinately hopeful man, that France was lost and the reaction\r\nvictorious, that his anger reached boiling-point. He took up Goethe's\r\n_Tag- und Jahres-hefte_, and was horrified by its author's \"apathy.\"\r\nGoethe tells how, when he was with the army in Silesia in 1790, he\r\nwrote one or two epigrams, and how later, at the royal headquarters in\r\nBreslau, he lived the life of a hermit, completely engrossed in the\r\nstudy of comparative anatomy. He adds that what originally led to his\r\ntaking up this study was his finding a half-cloven sheep's skull one\r\nevening in Venice on the sand-hills of the Lido.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" writes Börne, \"Goethe, a highly gifted man, a poet, in the best\r\nyears of his manhood ... to be in the council of war, in the camp of\r\nthe Titans, on the very spot where, forty years before, the audacious\r\nyet sublime war of kings against their peoples began, and to find no\r\ninspiration in these surroundings, to be moved to neither love nor\r\nhatred, neither prayer nor curse, to nothing but a few epigrams, which\r\nhe himself does not consider worth offering the reader. And with the\r\nfinest of regiments, the handsomest of officers passing in review\r\nbefore him, he finds nothing better to turn his attention to than\r\ncomparative anatomy! And walking by the sea-shore in Venice--Venice,\r\nthat _Arabian Night_ in stone and mortar, where everything is melody\r\nand colour, both nature and art, man and state, past and present,\r\nliberty and despotism; where even tyranny and murder merely clank like\r\nthe chains in some gruesome ballad (the Bridge of Sighs and the Council\r\nof Ten are scenes from Tartarus)--Venice, towards which I turn my\r\nlonging eyes, but cannot turn my steps, because the Austrian police\r\nlies in wait like a serpent at the city gates and repels with the\r\nterror of its poisonous gaze--there, after sunset, when the red glow\r\nof evening was spread over sea and land, and the waves of crimson light\r\nbroke upon the man of stone, and imparted their colour to his eternal\r\ngreyness; when, perhaps, the spirit of Werther came upon him, and he\r\nfelt that he still had a heart, that there were human beings around\r\nhim and a God above him; and the beat of his heart, the apparition\r\nof his dead youth terrified him, and he felt the hair standing up on\r\nhis head--he behaved as usual, escaped from his terrors, avoided all\r\ndisagreeable reflection, by creeping into a cloven sheep's skull and\r\nhiding there till night and coldness once more descended upon his\r\nheart! And I am to honour that man! to love that man! I would sooner\r\nthrow myself in the dust at the feet of Vitzli-Putzli, sooner lick the\r\nspittle of the Dalai Lama!\"\r\n\r\nCertainly Börne ought to have honoured this man, and for the very\r\nreason for which he despises him. For perhaps at no time was he more\r\nclearly worthy of all honour. Börne, by his own showing, would, like\r\nthe ordinary tourist in Venice, have spent himself in vague moonlight\r\nand sunset romancings on the subject of the Bridge of Sighs, the\r\nterrors of tyranny, the blessings of liberty, and all the melody and\r\ncolour--Goethe gazed at his sheep's skull. What was there remarkable\r\nabout it? It was split; and with his naked eye, that seeing eye which\r\npierced into the deepest recesses of nature, into the innermost\r\nworkshop of life, whence issue all its various forms, Goethe _saw_ the\r\ngreat truth, which he had already suspected, that all the bones of the\r\nskull were in reality metamorphosed vertebræ, thus making a discovery\r\nin the science of osteology that was closely connected with one he\r\nhad already given to the world in his work on the _Metamorphosis of\r\nPlants_, and founding philosophic anatomy, as he had already founded\r\nphilosophic botany. Börne did not perceive that this man, whose\r\nlife-work is one of the foundation-stones in the edifice of the modern\r\nworld, in this particular instance, with his intuition of the unity\r\nunderlying all variety of form, in his divine simplicity, resembles one\r\nof the fathers of ancient science, a Thales or a Heraclitus.\r\n\r\nBörne's attacks on Goethe do not come under the same category as\r\nMenzel's. They are never malicious, much less base. Though they\r\ncertainly now and again hit some vulnerable spot in the great man, they\r\nthrow more light on Börne's own nature than they do on Goethe's; and,\r\neven where they most clearly show the limitation of his intelligence,\r\nthey witness to the purity of his character. They have been powerless\r\nto affect men's admiration for Goethe's genius. It would be as foolish\r\nto judge Goethe by the false political standard set up by Börne in 1830\r\nas to judge Börne himself by the false German standard of 1870, which\r\nthose do, who say of him, what he said of Goethe, that he was no true\r\npatriot. It was natural, nay inevitable, that Börne should undervalue\r\nGoethe. It is possible to understand his want of understanding without\r\nsharing his dislike. And it is possible to do full justice to the rush\r\nof his pathos, to the elasticity and keen sparkle of his wit, without\r\nforgetting, as our eyes light on the seething, flashing cascades of his\r\nprose, that there is a deep, calm, wide ocean, called Goethe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Allerheiligen geht vor Allerseelen, die Propheten haben den Himmel\r\neher als das Volk.--Die Religion des Alterthums war die Cristalmutter\r\nvieler glänzenden Götter, die christliche ist die Perlemutter\r\neines einzigen aber unschätzbaren Gottes.--Das Erdenleben ist eine\r\nBastonade.--Jede Kirchenglocke ist eine Taucherglocke, unter welcher\r\nman die Perle der Religion findet.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Menzel: _Die deutsche Litteratur_, ii. pp. 205-222.\r\n\r\n[3] Heine: _Sämmtliche Werke._ xiii. 265.\r\n\r\n[4] \"Der Dichter ... fühlt zwar, dass das Schicksal in's Mittel treten\r\nmüsse, und lässt den Verräther durch eine rächende Bruderhand fallen;\r\nwie vielmehr muss uns dieser Theaterstreich indigniren, wenn wir\r\nwissen, dass der berühmte Liebhaber in der Wirklichkeit fortgelebt, um\r\ndas Unglück zu beschreiben, welches er angerichtet.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet ... it is true, feels that destiny ought to intervene, and\r\ntherefore the betrayer falls by the brother's avenging hand; but\r\nthis _coup de théâtre_ only arouses more indignation in us, who know\r\nthat in real life the famous lover lived on happily, to describe the\r\nmisfortunes of which he had been the author.\r\n\r\n[5] \"Die Eitelkeit des Emporkömmlings, die in den Frauen zugleich das\r\nVornehme, das Königliche, begehrt.\" _Translation_: The vanity of the\r\n_parvenu_, who is not attracted simply by women, but also by their\r\nposition, their royal birth.\r\n\r\n[6] \"Geadelt zu werden, im Reichthum zugleich den _haut goût_ de\r\nVornehmigkeit in behaglicher Sicherkeit zu geniessen, war ihm für\r\ndieses Leben das Höchste.\"\r\n\r\n[7] _I_ honour thee?

He was not capable of writing\r\nbooks, not even of writing essays and dissertations; for his explosions\r\nof emotion or thought there was no form so suitable as that of a\r\nletter. And these are real letters, not newspaper-articles, nor even\r\nnewspaper correspondence, but letters written to a friend, without\r\nthought of publication until that friend took the initiative, and asked\r\nBörne's permission to make an experimental selection of passages which\r\nmight be of interest to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe friend in question was Frau Jeannette Wohl, a lady who plays an\r\nimportant part in Börne's life, though perhaps not so important a part\r\nas he plays in hers. For upwards of twenty years, from 1816, when he\r\nmade her acquaintance, till his death in 1837, he gave her his entire\r\nconfidence, and rarely took any step without consulting her; and to\r\nher, during the same period, his career as an author, his health, his\r\ncircumstances generally, were of more importance than all else.\r\n\r\nWhen they saw each other for the first time, he was thirty and she\r\nthirty-three. She had been married to a rich man, with whom she had\r\nlived unhappily. After nursing him through a long illness, she got a\r\ndivorce from him, refusing to accept any share of his fortune or to\r\nretain his name. When Börne and she lived in the same town, he read\r\naloud to her everything that he wrote; when they were separated, she\r\nwould at one time urge him to work, eager that he should win fame and\r\nindependence; at another, fearing that he was too diligent, and that\r\nhis health, at all times precarious, might suffer, she would beg him\r\nnot to be too conscientious in the fulfilment of his engagements to the\r\npublishers, but to allow himself sufficient leisure and recreation.\r\n\r\nJealous of his honour, she underwent long periods of anxiety and\r\nirritation when it seemed to her that he was neglecting his duty to\r\nthe public. Börne had taken payment in advance from the subscribers to\r\n_Die Wage_ for the second volume of that periodical, and then, after\r\nbringing out only five numbers, made a lengthy pause, partly because\r\nhe was tired of the work, and partly because, being in pecuniary\r\ndifficulties, he was anxious to find more remunerative employment. Her\r\nletters, which he always looked for with almost feverish eagerness,\r\nat this time keep _Die Wage_ before his eyes by every device which\r\nthe ingenuity and perseverance of an anxious woman can suggest. She\r\nentreats and threatens, she scolds and teases, she sends him four long\r\npages with nothing upon them except _Die Wage, Die Wage._\r\n\r\nBut she is often quite as anxious to distract and amuse him, to prevent\r\nhim from over-exerting himself and to keep up his spirits. When he is\r\ntaken seriously ill at a distance from her, she grieves that she is not\r\nable to look after him, has once actually made up her mind to hazard\r\nher reputation by going to him; she knows very well that if she does,\r\npeople will no longer believe that what unites them is only friendship.\r\n\r\nIt was in reality a feeling midway between friendship and love, for\r\nwhich no name exists. After Jeannette's death there was found among her\r\npapers an ordinary _Gesindebüchlein der freien Stadt Frankfurt_,[1]\r\non the cover of which Börne had written his name, with the usual\r\nparticulars. On its first page stands:\r\n\r\nTook service    With whom?    For how     In what      Left service\r\n                               long       capacity?       when?\r\n\r\n15. Jan. 1818   Frau Wohl.    For ever.   As friend.   On the day of\r\n                                                         his death.\r\n\r\nThere could be no more laconic expression of a voluntary lifelong\r\ndevotion. And the last words were literally fulfilled, for it was on\r\nJeannette's face that the dying man's last look rested, and to her that\r\nhe spoke his last words: \"You have given me much happiness.\"\r\n\r\nJeannette Wohl's portrait, which Börne declared to be a good one, shows\r\nus a woman with a longish face, regular, pleasing features, a high\r\nforehead, an expressive, beautifully formed mouth, and bright, kindly\r\neyes; the firm chin indicates energy. Her voice is said to have been\r\nremarkably sweet. Hers was not a particularly original, and still less\r\nwas it a productive mind; she was one of those women who can merge\r\ntheir own individuality in that of the man to whom they are devoted. To\r\nBörne, the author, her natural feminine capacity for inspiring a man\r\nwith confidence in himself was invaluable; she was as much offended\r\nby any disparaging remark he made on the subject of his own ability\r\nor deserts, as if it had been made by another. She was comfort and\r\nconsolation to him in human form. In her he had a being on whom he\r\ncould place absolute reliance, to whom he could confide everything\r\nwithout the slightest fear of ever being misunderstood, far less\r\nbetrayed, and to whom he could address all his literary efforts. She\r\nwas to him an epitome of the ideal public for whom he wrote.\r\n\r\nIn one of his confidential letters he writes that his feeling for\r\nJeannette is described in the following passage from _La Nouvelle\r\nHeloïse_: \"C'est cette union touchante d'une sensibilité si vive et\r\nd'une inaltérable douceur; c'est cette pitié si tendre à tous les\r\nmaux d'autrui; c'est cet esprit juste et ce goût exquis qui tirent\r\nleur pureté de celle de l'âme; ce sont, en un mot, les charmes des\r\nsentiments, bien plus que ceux de la personne, que j'adore en vous.\"\r\nAnd we learn, from a letter of Jeannette's written in 1833, after this\r\nfriendship had lasted seventeen years, that the attraction he exercised\r\nwas at least equal to that which he experienced. She describes as a\r\nsort of _idée fixe_, or chronic ailment, the excitement that takes\r\npossession of her about the time when the mail may be expected. The day\r\nshe writes, she had been obliged to give up her usual occupations and\r\nlie on the sofa, and when at last the letter arrives, she weeps for joy.\r\n\r\nShe looks after his money matters, calculates the payments due to him,\r\ndraws his police pension for him; at one time, when he has a great\r\nlonging to travel in Italy, but cannot do it for want of means, she\r\ntakes a lottery ticket, in the hope of winning the necessary sum, and\r\nwhen she is disappointed in this, wishes to sell her piano, but finds\r\nshe cannot raise the required amount in this way either.[2] And\r\nall this without the incentive of love, in the narrower sense of the\r\nword. Her friends believed her to be capable of doing even more for\r\nhim. At the time that it first occurred to her that Börne ought to\r\npublish his letters to her, she expressed to a cousin the naïve doubt\r\nif it were possible to publish letters before the death of the person\r\nto whom they were addressed, to which the cousin replied that she had\r\nnot the least doubt that Jeannette was quite ready to let herself be\r\nburied if it would do any good to Dr. Börne.\r\n\r\nThey often travelled together, and sometimes, it would seem, lived\r\ntogether; but the nature of their relation to each other never\r\naltered. It is probable that at one time, in the first stage of their\r\nfriendship, Börne tried to persuade Jeannette to marry him, but her\r\nfear lest the relation existing between them might lose its charm\r\nby being turned into an ordinary, everyday marriage, a fear which\r\nBörne himself afterwards shared, proved an insurmountable obstacle.\r\nConsidering that they were both free to dispose of themselves as\r\nthey would, it seems hardly possible that their relation could have\r\nremained what it was for all these years without the existence of some\r\nslight, it might be almost unconscious, physical antipathy on her side,\r\nor on both sides. An outward hindrance to their union undoubtedly\r\nexisted in the difference of their creeds. Börne belonged to the\r\nChristian, Jeannette to the Jewish confession; her orthodox mother\r\nwas strongly opposed to her becoming a Christian, and in those days\r\ngreat difficulties were placed in the way of mixed marriages. But this\r\nwas not the main difficulty. Jeannette herself writes that to marry\r\nBörne would require \"more courage and more self-confidence\" than she\r\npossesses. And in this instance we see the man whom we knew in his\r\nyouth as the passionate lover, and who all his life long suffered from\r\na jealous disposition, quickly rise to the height of pure devotion; he\r\nconstantly urges Jeannette, for her own sake, to marry a man worthy of\r\nher, and make a happy home.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, in answer to the words just quoted, Börne writes: \"I swear\r\nto you by Almighty God that, ardent and often expressed as my desire\r\nto make you mine may have been, it has always been more of your\r\nhappiness than of my own that I have thought. My love for you makes me\r\nhappy; what more could marriage give me, since it could not increase\r\nthat love? Though I did not confess it to you, I always dreaded that\r\nmarriage might drag down our beautiful friendship to the level of\r\neveryday, sordid reality. But I thought, what I still think, that _you_\r\nwould gain something by it, and this would indirectly have increased\r\nmy happiness. So there is nothing to prevent you from marrying another\r\nman; you and I should lose nothing by that.\"\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the truth of this last, audacious assertion was put\r\nto the proof. At a somewhat advanced age, Jeannette actually fell in\r\nlove with and married a man much younger than herself. It was their\r\nmutual admiration for Börne that brought the couple together, and in\r\nJeannette's answer to the letter in which Straus asks her to marry\r\nhim there is a long reference to Börne, so enlightening in its simple\r\neloquence that it cannot be dispensed with in this estimate of his\r\ncharacter as a man and as an author. She writes:\r\n\r\n\"The Doctor has no one in the world but me; I am to him friend, sister,\r\nall that these words convey of kindliness, friendliness, sympathy. Can\r\nyou grudge this to him, to whom life has given nothing else, and who\r\nhas reconciled himself to his fate ... is even contented with it.... Ican\r\nthink of no other possibility than that the Doctor should be free to\r\ncome to us when, where, and for as long as he chooses; for altogether,\r\nif he wishes. I can't say _you_, my heart is too full; canst _thou_\r\nthink anything else possible? If so, then all is different from what\r\nI thought. I!--we!--dream of deserting a man like the Doctor--why,\r\nhe would be a ruined, a lost man! I would rather give up everything,\r\nrather die, than have that upon my conscience; I could not do it,\r\neven if I would.... I am trembling all over, and as pale as death from\r\nwriting even these few words on the subject. For nothing agitates me\r\nso deeply as the very thought of such treason, of such infidelity to\r\nsuch fidelity. As long as I live, till I draw my last breath, I shall\r\nfeel for Börne the love of a daughter for her father, of a sister for\r\nher brother, of a friend for a friend. If you do not understand, cannot\r\ngrasp the situation, do not know me well enough--then all is over, all\r\nis night. I can write no more. But no more is necessary. I am thankful\r\nthis is over.\"[3]\r\n\r\nEvents proved that Straus thoroughly entered into Jeannette's feelings,\r\nindeed shared them. He, too, became a faithful friend to Börne. For\r\nfive months in the summer of 1833 Börne lived with them in Switzerland.\r\nThey then removed, for his sake, to Paris; where they all lived\r\ntogether from the end of 1833 till his death, spending the summers\r\nat Auteuil. The one person who permitted himself to make disparaging\r\ncomment on this arrangement was Heine, in that unfortunate passage\r\nin his book, _Ludwig Börne_, which led to the duel in which he was\r\nwounded by Straus. Heine afterwards, of his own free will, expunged the\r\npassage. But in anger and grief at the harm done to his reputation by\r\nthis work on Börne, he was heard to call Jeannette the baleful woman\r\nwho, on his triumphal progress as Germany's chosen poet, crossed his\r\npath, prophesying evil, and caused him to start back and drop his\r\nlaurel wreath in the dirt.[4]\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Jeannette never forgave Heine his unpardonable\r\nmolestation; yet no one could have been less of a Megæra. What Börne\r\nonce wrote to her, joking, as he often did, on the subject of her\r\nfaulty orthography, was almost true, namely, that in the letter he had\r\nreceived that day there were more faults than she had herself, for\r\nthere was one.\r\n\r\nIn her opinions we can follow the different steps of Börne's political\r\ndevelopment. After the Revolution of July she, too, is a radical\r\ndemocrat. In the expressive words of her biographer, Schnapper-Arndt:\r\n\"She most frequently thinks with Börne, at times in opposition to him,\r\nnever without him. But she does seem to be perfectly independent in her\r\npassionate sympathy with the revolt of the Polish nation, a feeling so\r\nstrong that it leads her to heap reproaches on Börne for being capable\r\nat such a moment of writing about the Italian opera in Paris. The\r\nPolish scythemen, the liberty of Poland--nothing else is worthy to be\r\nmentioned along with this. It seems to her that every one must help;\r\nshe gives her own most cherished possessions to the cause; and nothing\r\ncan exceed her shame when Germany shows itself indifferent to it,\r\nnothing her joy when she can send Börne proofs of the fact that a storm\r\nof sympathy and enthusiasm is sweeping over the country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The \"service book\" which German employés are required to keep.\r\n\r\n[2] On this occasion Börne writes: \"Love has affected the reason of\r\nmany a human being, but I never heard of human kindness doing so. No\r\none was capable of this but you.... It is well that you have never\r\nfound the man of your heart--you cannot even stand wine mixed with\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n[3] All this information on the subject of Jeannette is to be found in\r\nGottlieb Schnapper-Arndt's article: _Jeannette Straus-Wohl und ihre\r\nBeziehungen zu Börne. Westermanns Monatshefte_, April 1887.\r\n\r\n[4] (Alfred Meissner: _Erinnerungen_, p. 79, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nBÖRNE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progress of the insurrection in Poland, which lasted from the\r\nwinter of 1830 till the summer of 1831, was followed with lively\r\nsympathy by almost all the nations of Europe. All knew that the\r\nstruggle in Poland was deciding whether absolutism or national liberty\r\nwas to prevail in the Europe of the future. The movements of the\r\ncombatants were eagerly noted; every victory of the Poles was hailed\r\nwith popular rejoicing, every defeat was heard of with sorrow. Towards\r\nthe close of the struggle, when it became evident that the Poles,\r\nunaided, could not triumph, numerous appeals were addressed by German\r\nsubjects to their respective governments, urging them to assist Poland.\r\nThe Germans then possessed the quality, which Bismarck afterwards laid\r\nto their charge as a fault--a fault of which he has cured them--of\r\nbeing almost more interested in the welfare of other nations than in\r\ntheir own, to the extent even of desiring that welfare when it could\r\nonly be purchased by some surrender of power on the part of Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen all was over with the Poles, the Germans tried to give proof of\r\ntheir sympathy by showing as much hospitality as possible to the Polish\r\nrefugees on their wanderings through Central Europe to France. They\r\neverywhere met with a warm reception; a committee was appointed in\r\nalmost every German town to collect money for them and help them on\r\ntheir journey. Jeannette Wohl's letters to Börne at this time contain\r\nmany significant details. She tells that a number of Polish officers\r\nwho came by water from Hanau to Frankfort-on-Main were escorted all the\r\nway by enthusiasts, that bands played and salutes were fired as they\r\nentered the town, and that, they were carried shoulder high through\r\nthe crowd. When bands of Poles march through the town, all heads are\r\nuncovered as they pass. The town defrays their expenses at the hotels.\r\nA wounded Polish officer, who dies at one of the hotels, is followed to\r\nhis grave by thousands, including the city militia. A goldsmith sets a\r\nsplinter of iron taken from the wound of another Polish officer in the\r\nshape of a little sword, and presents it to him.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Poland the bulwark which protected Germany from the\r\ninfluence of the Russian autocracy was broken down. The defeat of the\r\nPoles was a defeat for the champions of liberty in every country. The\r\nshock was a violent one.\r\n\r\nA man who lived at Bremerhafen at the time when the infernal machine\r\ndevised by the wholesale murderer, Thomas, exploded, tells how,\r\nimmediately after he had heard the report of the fearful explosion, a\r\ntorn, bleeding hand flew in at his open window and fell upon the desk\r\nat which he sat writing. Something of the same kind happened to German\r\nauthors' when Warsaw capitulated. Shattered Poland's dissevered hand\r\nfell without warning upon their desks. Heine writes in 1831, in his\r\nintroduction to Kahldorf's book on the aristocracy: \"I feel while I am\r\nwriting as if the blood shed at Warsaw were gushing from my paper, and\r\nas if the Berlin officers' and diplomatists' shouts of joy were ringing\r\nin my ears.\"\r\n\r\nThe three Powers that had divided Poland determined to take immediate\r\nadvantage of the victory to overpower dismayed European Liberalism,\r\nand this in four countries at the same time--in Germany, where the\r\nBundestag was to inaugurate, and Prussia and Austria to carry out, a\r\nstill more energetic reaction; in Italy, which was once more to be\r\noccupied by Austria; in Portugal, where Don Miguel was to be supported\r\nagainst his brother; and in the Netherlands, where the King of Holland\r\nwas to be assisted in his struggle with rebellious Belgium.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the suppression of the Polish revolt, a note was\r\naddressed by the Cabinet of St. Petersburg to the German governments,\r\nin which Russia advised them to keep the revolutionary tendencies in\r\ntheir respective countries in check, and offered them her assistance in\r\ndoing so. The censorship at once became more severe, and many Liberal\r\nnewspapers and periodicals were suppressed. The Chambers of the South\r\nGerman States protested, and the utterances of the Liberal press, in\r\nspite of all warnings and threats, became more violent and reckless\r\nfrom day to day. The general belief had hitherto been that it was\r\nthe desire of the sovereigns to meet the wishes of their people, but\r\nthat they were held back by their advisers. Now this belief fell to\r\nthe ground. The conviction became general that the unification of all\r\nthe German countries in one constitutional, strongly democratic State\r\nwas at hand. Politically short-sighted, and imbued with all manner of\r\noptimistic ideas, the general public were unable to believe that such\r\na movement as that originated by the Revolution of July could exhaust\r\nitself without any political result. The champions of Liberalism had\r\npreached \"progress\" as a religion, and people had arrived at the belief\r\nthat progress must inevitably be victorious, and that each attempt at\r\nreaction would actually work for good in the end.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of public opinion at the time of the publication\r\nof the first volume of Börne's _Letters from Paris_, which gained him\r\ngreat popularity. They were promptly suppressed. (November 1831.) This\r\nsuppression, and the abuse heaped on the author by his opponents, added\r\nto the sensation which the bold language of the book had created.\r\n\r\nIn these letters, Börne's style is only occasionally humorous, whereas\r\nin his earlier writings it invariably was so. We seldom find the\r\nquiet, resigned sort of humour distinguishing, for instance, his\r\ncharacteristic description of his capture by night and his imprisonment\r\nin Frankfort in 1820: \"I was refused a boot-jack _Stiefelknecht_ = boot\r\nservant or slave), that the distressing symbol of servitude might not\r\nbe always before my eyes. I was only allowed to use knife and fork in\r\nthe presence of a warder, in case I should injure myself. Paper, pen,\r\nand ink were granted me only after repeated entreaties, and paper in\r\nrestricted quantity; they were afraid my health might suffer from my\r\nsitting still too much. Every evening a warder came with a lantern to\r\nexamine the stove and see that it did not smoke, as smoke might be\r\ninjurious to my fine eyes; he also examined the grating in front of the\r\nwindow, to make sure that thieves could not break in, &c, &c.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only at the commencement of his stay in Paris, while he is kept\r\nin a state of constant elation by the supposed attainment of great\r\npolitical results, that he still jests lightly and freely (as, for\r\nexample, on the subject of the many Princes Henry of Reuss, Greiz, and\r\nSchleiz, who are now being punished by the revolution in Gera for all\r\nthe agony the committing to memory of their respective numbers cost him\r\nat school); the jesting tone soon vanishes from his letters, and the\r\nstriking, convincing similes are all that remains of his old style.\r\n\r\nHis chief feeling, when he thinks of his Fatherland, is shame. In\r\nthe Days of July, Englishmen and Dutchmen, Spaniards and Italians,\r\nPoles and Greeks, helped to fight for the liberty of France, which\r\nmeans the liberty of all nations; but no Germans were there. With its\r\nadministration of justice, its censorship, and its guilds, Germany will\r\nsoon be the antiquarian museum of Europe. But more obnoxious to him\r\nthan anything else is the German spirit of loyalty and humility. The\r\nSpaniards, the Italians, the Russians, and all the others are slaves;\r\nthe people that speak the German tongue are lackeys. Slavery only makes\r\nmen unhappy, it does not degrade them; servitude degrades. (January\r\n25th 1831.) At an international dinner in Paris, when speeches were\r\nbeing made by Liberals of every nationality, shame for his country\r\nprevented him from getting up to speak on its behalf. He thought: These\r\nPoles, these Spaniards, who have spoken, represent their country. \"But\r\nwhat do I represent? what achievements do I recall? I stand alone,\r\nI am a lackey, wearing, like all other Germans, the livery of Count\r\nMünch-Bellinghausen.\" (14th December 1831.)\r\n\r\nClosely connected with this feeling of shame is an irritability, an\r\ninclination to be indignant with every one and everything, which gives\r\na certain impression of weakness, of failing health. Everything, great\r\nand small, is \"infuriating--from the long-suffering of the nations\r\nand their slowness to rise in revolt, to a rude letter from Spontini\r\nto the Berlin orchestra; from the proposal to grant Louis Philippe a\r\nliberal civil-list, to the deficiencies of an encyclopædia.[1]\r\nAs time goes on he actually seeks out provocations. We come upon such\r\nexpressions as: \"I am cheerful, for I have been angry;\" or \"You cannot\r\ngive me greater pleasure than by reporting cases of German stupidity to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nBut in the years immediately following the Revolution of July, shame\r\nand anger are drowned in a storm-tossed sea of hope. Börne feels as\r\nabsolutely certain of the speedy approach of a universal conflagration,\r\nfollowed by the victory of liberty, as the first Christians felt of the\r\nimmediate end of the world, followed by the day of judgment, with its\r\ndecree of salvation for the elect, and damnation for the hard of heart.\r\nHe is in a state of excitement which makes it impossible for him to be\r\nthe chronicle-writer of his time; he feels that it is his mission to be\r\nits prophet, in twelve long volumes, if need be.[2]\r\n\r\nAlas, it is only the pessimistic prophets who, sooner or later, always\r\nprove to be right. And Börne was an optimistic prophet, an enthusiast,\r\nnaïvely and incorrigibly given to believing in what he wished. Events\r\nin France have inspired him with the belief that the death-knell of the\r\nreaction has sounded. He seriously reproaches himself for being ashamed\r\nto kiss such and such a Frenchman's hand, \"the hand which has burst\r\nour fetters, and given to us serfs the accolade of knighthood.\" (17th\r\nSeptember 1830.) He knows that the end is at hand. On the occasion of\r\nCharles X.'s laying some foundation-stone, Börne remarks that it is\r\nhigh time for kings to stop making themselves ridiculous by laying the\r\nfoundation-stones of buildings. It would be more suitable for them now\r\nto nail the last tile on the roofs. For the time is at hand when the\r\nroyal cooks will ask each other: \"For whom shall we be preparing dinner\r\nto-morrow?\" (19th September 1830.) A month after this, being asked\r\nwhat he thinks likely to happen, he expresses his firm conviction that\r\nthe following spring will see the whole of Europe in conflagration.\r\nHe pities the diplomatists, positively feels sympathy for them. When\r\nthe Polish insurrection breaks out, he does not believe, taking the\r\ngreat strength of the Russians into consideration, that it will be as\r\neasy for the Poles as for the Belgians to attain their object, but\r\nis sure that they will succeed in the end. And like a refrain recurs\r\nthe assertion that, one after another, all the countries of Europe\r\nwill emancipate themselves, Germany alone remaining in its miserable\r\ncondition. And yet at times he foresees the salvation of Germany. When\r\nthe cholera is raging in Moscow, he understands its signification,\r\nsees the finger of God in it: \"This is once more the naked hand of\r\nGod. The Powers are prevented from gathering together great armies,\r\nand if, in spite of everything, they persist in doing so ...  I have a\r\npresentiment--no, it is more than that, I _know_ that the cholera will\r\ndo what as yet nothing else has had the power to do, it will rouse the\r\nmost procrastinating and timid nation on the face of the earth to show\r\ncourage.\" (3rd November 1830.) His confidence in the ultimate success\r\nof the Poles increased, supporting itself on the theory that those\r\nalways win who have no choice but victory or death. At the close of\r\nthe year 1830 he is certain that the ruling sovereigns are doomed; his\r\n\"modest\" New Year's wish for his friend and himself is, that 1831 maybe\r\na better year for them than it will be for emperors and kings. He will\r\nhave to say to his servant: \"If an emperor comes, keep your eye upon\r\nhim, and don't leave him alone in my room.\" And he ends by assuring\r\nhim that in 1831 a dozen of eggs will be of more value than a dozen\r\nprinces. (26th December 1830.)\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of January 1831, he maintains that if only the Poles can\r\navoid a pitched battle, the Russians, \"powerful as they are, are lost.\"\r\nAnd he still takes it for granted that the French will take up arms in\r\ndefence of Poland: France would be insane (_ganz von Sinnen_) if she\r\ndid not take advantage of this unique opportunity to weaken the power\r\nof Russia. On the 11th of February he is perfectly positive that there\r\nwill be war. He himself has never doubted it for a single day, and\r\nmany who would not believe it before, have come round to his opinion.\r\nOutbursts of rejoicing are frequent. The Poles have once more received\r\nhelp from above; there is \"tolerably certain\" news of rebellion having\r\nbroken out in several Russian provinces. On the 6th of March, when\r\nthings are looking extremely bad for Poland, he has another false piece\r\nof news to rejoice over. A Parisian commercial house has received\r\nintelligence that the Russian forces have been scattered, and also that\r\nthe Lithuanians are in revolt behind them, \"which will decide matters.\"\r\nHe is jubilant. From this time onwards, tyrants will be threatened with\r\nthe Poles, as naughty children are threatened with the chimney-sweep.\r\nNicholas boasted that he would roll the Poles together like a ball of\r\nyarn; the ball has turned into a bomb, which has blown him to pieces!\r\nBörne actually has visions of Paris illuminated on the occasion. On the\r\n18th of March, when it is no longer possible to believe in the truth\r\nof the favourable news, he is already mounted on a new chimera. All is\r\nwell; for in France itself a great change is impending: \"Matters here\r\nare in such a position, that I daily, nay hourly, expect a revolution.\r\nThings cannot continue as they are for four weeks longer....\"\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly a strong proof of Börne's honesty that he allowed\r\nJeannette to publish his letters as they came from his pen, unedited,\r\nwithout any suppression or modification of prophetic passages to which\r\nfacts speedily gave the lie. But their perusal does not increase\r\nour faith in him as a politician. The contradiction between what is\r\nprophesied and what happens is at times so marked as to be comical.\r\nOn the 25th of December he is in despair because of Lafayette's\r\nindecision: Lafayette is omnipotent, can bring about whatever he\r\npleases, has only to threaten to give up the command of the National\r\nGuard to reduce the king, the ministers, and the Chambers to immediate\r\nsubmission. Next day, the 26th of December, he announces shortly\r\nthat Lafayette has been deposed from his command, without so much\r\nas a dog barking. Strange, says the reader to himself, that such an\r\neager politician should never have felt it a necessity to study the\r\nscience of politics, in order to be able to form his conclusions with\r\nsome understanding of the subject--that he should have been perfectly\r\nsatisfied to produce ephemeral journalistic effusions, of value to-day,\r\nto-morrow cast into the oven.\r\n\r\nWhat constantly misleads Börne is that optimism of his, which has\r\nbeen already alluded to, an optimism at once naïve and fanatical,\r\nwhich perpetually discovers reasons why the evil that happens is at\r\nthe same time the best thing that could happen. In March 1831, he\r\ntrembles for the Poles, and declares that he is prepared for the worst.\r\n\"But,\" he continues, \"such a victory would be more disastrous for the\r\nRussians than all their defeats. The arrogant Nicholas would become\r\npresumptuous, and believe that he could dispose of France as easily\r\nas of Poland.\" What a ground of comfort! Börne goes on hoping for a\r\nrevolution in Paris which shall shake all thrones. But it does not\r\ncome. He presently discovers that this quietness of France is more\r\ndangerous for the crowned heads than anything else could be. On the\r\n30th of November 1831, he writes: \"For forty years France has been the\r\ncrater of Europe. When that crater ceases to shoot forth flames, no\r\nthrone in Europe will be safe for one night.... Nothing could have been\r\nso disastrous for the monarchs as the fall of Warsaw. They have ruined\r\na miracle, and therefore now believe themselves capable of working\r\nmiracles.\" In other words: A revolution in Paris is good, no revolution\r\nis still better. The victory of Poland would have been the ruin of the\r\nmonarchs; the fall of Poland is more fatal for them still.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of all this is Börne's very remarkable, implicit faith\r\nin God, which is but rarely disturbed by the doubts of his ever active\r\nbrain. The formula to which he almost always has recourse when he\r\nneeds comfort is, that he trusts in God. Nicholas advances against the\r\nPoles with an overwhelming force; Börne \"trusts in God.\" It is, as a\r\nmatter of fact, only the Polish nobility who have risen in revolt, but\r\nBörne \"trusts in the wisdom of God and the stupidity of his so-called\r\nrepresentatives.\" He himself is, he declares, wiser than all the rest\r\nin France, as he was wiser than the rest in Germany; why? Because he\r\n\"believes in God and nature,\" while the others believe in men and\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nYet at times his faith wavers. We saw how at first he rejoiced over the\r\ncholera, saw the finger of God in it, felt that it would drive even\r\nthe Germans to revolution. Only two months later (19th January 1831)\r\nhe describes its actual effect, the manner in which it is paralysing\r\nthe nations and aiding in the demolition of such liberty as still\r\nexists. At first he wrote: \"What nothing else has been able to do,\r\nthe cholera will do;\" now it is the exact opposite: \"What no Emperor\r\nof Russia, no devil could prevent, the cholera prevents.\" And he who\r\nsaw in that plague \"God's naked hand,\" now exclaims: \"And the priests\r\nwould have us believe that this is a judgment of God!\" Nine months\r\nlater (25th November) he gets out of the difficulty with a witty,\r\nthoughtless joke: \"It is not often that God sends a heavenly commission\r\nof justice down to earth to investigate into the stewardship of his\r\nrepresentatives, and so far, when such a thing has happened, it has\r\nnot improved matters. The heavenly emissaries are out of their element\r\non earth; they make mistakes, they even allow themselves to be bribed.\r\nWe saw this lately, in the case of the Asiatic cholera, which punished\r\nthe oppressed in place of the oppressors. God only helps those who\r\nhelp themselves.\"[3]\r\n\r\nOnce only, when the fall of Poland is evidently at hand (5th March\r\n1831), we feel that Börne's faith in his system is seriously shaken.\r\nWhen the Russians are getting the upper hand, he, as usual, makes\r\nfree use of his favourite words--God, the devil, &c. He comes to the\r\nconclusion that \"not even the wisdom of God, nothing but the stupidity\r\nof the devil can save Poland now.\" And then he interrupts himself with\r\na question: \"But is there a God at all? My heart does not doubt it yet,\r\nbut one's brain feels bewildered enough at times. And even if he does\r\nexist, of what use is an eternal God to mortal man? Were he mortal like\r\nus ... he would take account of time and life, would not delay justice\r\nso long, would not wait to pay to future generations that which was\r\ntheir forefathers' due. Liberty can and will triumph, sooner or later;\r\nbut why not now? It may triumph the very day after the fall of Poland;\r\nand that would be enough to break one's heart.... Can there be a\r\nGod? Is this justice? We loathe cannibals, stupid savages, who only\r\neat the flesh of their enemies. But we are reconciled to a far worse\r\ncannibalism--to the torturing, slaughtering, hewing asunder of the\r\npresent, body and soul, with its joys and its happiness, its wishes and\r\nits hopes, to satisfy the appetite of the future.\"[4]\r\n\r\nA few days later, however, he returns to his accustomed faith in God\r\nand to that optimism over which no disappointments can prevail.\r\n\r\nHere and there in these letters we come upon sheer political twaddle,\r\nsuch as the fantasies on the consequences of the revolt in Hanover,\r\nand here and there on proofs of a positively foolish credulity, as,\r\nfor example, when Börne allows himself to be persuaded that it is\r\nMetternich who has instigated the disturbances in South Germany in\r\norder that he may take possession of Bavaria while the troops are\r\noccupied; and again, that it is Louis Philippe's secret intention to\r\nreinstate the dynasty of Charles X. on the throne.[5]\r\n\r\nBut frequently too we come upon utterances that show real political\r\nsagacity, a natural capacity for grasping a situation, and an unusual\r\ngift of prevision.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of November 1830, only four months after the Revolution,\r\nBörne already perceives that all that has happened amounts to no more\r\nthan this, that the industrial magnates, those who understand nothing\r\nbut \"fear and money,\" have come into power. And he is quite certain\r\nthat, since this Revolution has not attained its object, those in\r\npower refusing to see anything in it but a change of dynasty, a new\r\nrevolution is unavoidable, \"and may be expected without fail.\" A week\r\nlater, with correct appreciation of the facts, and logical deduction,\r\nhe explains how events will follow on one another: As these merchants\r\nand manufacturers, who for fifteen years have been declaiming against\r\naristocracy, have hardly got into power before they endeavour to form\r\na new aristocracy, of monied men, of adventurers, not based like the\r\nold on a principle, but upon privileges conferred by the possession of\r\nproperty; the French people, with their passion for equality, will,\r\nthe next time they make a revolution, attack that which is now the\r\nfoundation of privilege, namely, property; and this process will be\r\naccompanied by such horrors as no previous revolution has witnessed.\r\nBörne, we observe, has a prevision of socialism as a power; he\r\nprophesies the Commune. A year later (1st December 1831) he feels so\r\ncertain how things will go that he writes: \"I so plainly foresee the\r\ngreat war between the poor and the rich that I feel as if we were in\r\nthe middle of it now;\" and at this period, in spite of his strong moral\r\nbias, he has come to the conclusion that the first thing to be aimed\r\nat is the support of right by might. If this is not practicable, then\r\nall that can be done is to touch men's hearts, to gain them for the\r\ngood cause by working upon their feelings, and to pursue tyranny with\r\nridicule, hate, and contempt. It is of no use whatever to be simply\r\nhonest, to have the right on one's side. No; \"their honesty is their\r\nbane. They imagine that the main thing is to be, and to prove that they\r\nare, right. They talk of liberty as a barrister would talk of some\r\npiece of property. As if it were reasons that were wanted here!\" (1st\r\nFebruary 1831.)\r\n\r\nThe man who shows himself to us in these letters, is, after all, a\r\npolitical enthusiast, a lover of liberty, rather than a statesman.\r\nHe not only loves the common people but, like Rousseau, he has a\r\ntrue admiration for those who have not been \"spoiled\" by wealth or\r\neducation; and this admiration goes hand in hand with a steadily\r\nincreasing hatred of all the legitimate sovereigns and princes of\r\nEurope, which, when Börne casts all moderation from him along with his\r\nillusions, turns into veritable nihilism. \"To think that ten yards\r\nof hempen cord would suffice to give the world peace, happiness, and\r\nquiet.\"[6] The peoples--the sovereigns,--the peoples--the sovereigns;\r\nit was between these poles that the pendulum of Börne's political\r\nthought incessantly swung; they were the poles of the political\r\nthought of the time. And it was natural enough that he should stop\r\nshort at this antithesis, because he was essentially a democrat, such\r\na confirmed democrat that, as he himself plainly tells us, he took no\r\ninterest whatever in the study of the individual human being. It was\r\nas much of a nuisance to him to have to inquire into the peculiarities\r\ndistinguishing one human being from another, as it was to have to\r\ndecipher extremely minute handwriting. He preferred to occupy himself\r\nwith humanity in the mass and with books. (3rd November 1830.) It is no\r\nwonder that we miss in him the delicate psychological insight which we\r\nlook for in a great writer. To compensate for this deficiency we have\r\nthe sympathy with whole nations, with whole classes, with a wide circle\r\nof readers, which enables an author to electrify a public, and ensures\r\npopularity during his lifetime even to a peculiarly audacious writer\r\noccupying a peculiarly precarious position.\r\n\r\nNot that Börne is unjust or prejudiced in his judgment of individuals.\r\nOn the contrary, he shows the calm benevolence of superior\r\nintelligence; though he also undoubtedly at times evinces a real\r\nmiddle-class antipathy to what is over-aristocratic, and corresponding\r\nindulgence towards what is commonplace. When De Musset appears, he\r\nis at once struck by a kinship with Heine which surprises him in a\r\nFrenchman. He promptly recognises, even over-estimates Berlioz's\r\ngenius, and every one knows how neglected and misunderstood Berlioz\r\nwas. Prince Pückler he criticises appreciatively, without any warmth,\r\nbut with a proper discernment of his merits; only he cannot understand\r\nhow it was possible for any one to believe that Pückler's bright, but\r\nessentially unpoetical letters, could have been written by Heine. As\r\nregards Heine himself, it is for long only his worship of Napoleon that\r\nis distinctly antipathetic to Börne, who appreciates, nay admires him\r\nin every other respect.\r\n\r\nThere is something suggestive in Börne's sincere admiration for Paul\r\nde Kock, in the warm appreciation with which he mentions him, and the\r\nzest with which he perseveringly reads eight volumes of his novels on\r\nend. It is their naïve and faithful representation of the life of the\r\nParisian _petit bourgeois_ that seems to Börne so admirable. He goes\r\nthe length, though half in jest, of praising De Kock's philosophy of\r\nlife, and on this hardly suitable occasion mounts his old hobby, and\r\nwrites: \"Though he does not, like Goethe in _Wilhelm Meister_, serve\r\nup didactic letters with truffles, he gives us good strong philosophy\r\ndressed in bourgeois fashion.\" (3rd March 1831.) Paul de Kock exalted\r\nat the expense of Goethe!\r\n\r\nThis sort of criticism says little for Börne's æsthetic sense. Of his\r\npolitical sagacity convincing proof is given by his pronouncements on\r\nTalleyrand. In 1830 he at once feels quite confident that Talleyrand\r\nwill serve France well in London, and does not allow his confidence\r\nto be shaken by the Parisians' hatred of that diplomatist. He sees\r\nthe absurdity of the loud complaint of the Liberal newspapers that\r\nTalleyrand, as one of the framers of the Peace of Vienna, is certain\r\nto support the Holy Alliance. He comprehends that neither the Holy\r\nAlliance nor anything else is holy to Talleyrand. And long afterwards\r\nhe again refers to the unreasonableness of the accusation brought\r\nagainst that sagacious diplomatist of having served and betrayed\r\nevery government in turn, acutely remarking that he did not betray\r\ngovernments, he only deserted them, and that not until they were dead.\r\nWhat Börne reads in Talleyrand's hard face is necessity, cast as it\r\nwere in bronze.\r\n\r\nBut the chief cause of the leniency of Börne's judgments is to be\r\nsought, not in his intellect, but in his heart, in the tenderness of\r\nhis nature, in the strong bias towards kindly interpretation, which\r\nis not contradicted by his many violent, inconsiderate utterances;\r\nfor these themselves, closely examined, prove to be but expressions\r\nof his love to his kind. He was a loving-hearted man, and in so far\r\na Christian by nature, by instinct. This is the explanation of his\r\nconversion to Christianity. The reproach of hypocrisy in his case is a\r\nfoolish one; his conception of Christianity may not have been profound,\r\nbut he acted from honest, independent conviction. He became a Christian\r\nbecause he was a democrat and a humanitarian. To him Christianity was\r\nnot simply a continuation and supplement of Judaism, it was rather the\r\nreligion of humanity, and more especially \"the religion of all poor\r\ndevils.\" Every man who loved his kind was in Börne's eyes a Christian.\r\nChristianity was moreover to him the religion of liberty, especially\r\nin its Catholic form; for it was as Catholicism that it had destroyed\r\nthe world-empire of the Romans. In the ardent love of liberty of\r\nthese Poles with whom he has so much sympathy, he sees a proof of the\r\nliberalising power of Catholicism.[7]\r\n\r\nBörne does not personally believe in the dogmas of Christianity, or\r\nconsider that faith is its essence; yet any attack on these dogmas\r\nis most repugnant to him. He sneers at Saint-Simonism because of its\r\nantagonism to the Christian religion, and he considers Strauss's\r\n_Life of Jesus_ to be not only a useless, but a mischievous book. All\r\nthis makes it easy to understand how it was possible for him, in the\r\nlast years of his life, to be completely carried away by a democratic\r\nCatholic like Lamennais, whose _Paroles d'un Croyant_, an attempt to\r\nblend Liberalism with religion, he translated and overrated. Religious\r\nRadicalism, as here expressed, was the magic formula to which the free\r\nand the locked-up powers of his own soul responded.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the first volumes of the _Letters from Paris_,\r\nBörne, following the general trend of Oppositionist feeling in\r\nGermany, progressed from enthusiasm for constitutionalism to hope of\r\nrevolution. In April 1832, not six months after their publication, one\r\nof the leaders of the Opposition, Dr Siebenpfeiffer, issued a general\r\ninvitation to all the different German nationalities to attend a great\r\nnational festival, to be held at the castle of Hambach, near Neustadt\r\non the Haardt, on the 27th of May, the anniversary of the concession\r\nof the Bavarian constitution. It was to be a festival of brotherhood\r\nfor all whose desire and aim was the regeneration of Germany. This\r\nfestival, however, seemed so suspicious to the government of Rhenish\r\nBavaria, that it was forbidden; strangers were prohibited from\r\nvisiting Neustadt or its environs from the 26th to the 28th of May,\r\nand any assemblage of more than five persons in the streets or other\r\npublic places was forbidden. These prohibitions excited such general\r\ndiscontent that the authorities were obliged to withdraw them.\r\n\r\nPeople streamed to the festival from every point of the compass. Almost\r\nevery German country sent representatives--the majority, of course,\r\nbeing inhabitants of the Palatinate itself. Even Frenchmen were there\r\nin large numbers, and Poles naturally were not lacking. The assembly\r\nnumbered about thirty thousand in all.\r\n\r\nBörne, who came from Paris, was the most fêted guest. His journey to\r\nNeustadt was a sort of triumphal procession. He was cheered everywhere.\r\nTorchlight processions and serenades were the order of the day.\r\n\r\nHe writes from Freiburg; \"You have no idea what an impression my\r\n_Letters from Paris_ have made in Germany. I never expected anything\r\nlike it myself. Meyer, Wurm, and others had given out, had printed,\r\nthat I could never again show myself in Germany, because I should\r\nbe turned out of all respectable society. Nice prophets they are! I\r\nhave done nothing but receive homage ever since I arrived. My room is\r\nnever empty. I often have not chairs enough for my visitors. At the\r\nHambach festival all present desired to make my acquaintance. It was\r\nso fatiguing that it has made me ill. When I made my appearance on the\r\nstreet in Neustadt, shouts were heard from the restaurants and from the\r\npassing carriages of: 'Hurrah for Börne! hurrah for the author of the\r\n_Letters from Paris!'_ The Heidelberg students serenaded me. All the\r\npatriots, Wirth and the rest, declared that the credit of the patriotic\r\nmovement in Germany was due to me; I was first; the others all came\r\nafter. Many, moved to tears, arid unable to speak for emotion, embraced\r\nme warmly. It has been the same thing here in Freiburg. The students\r\ncame to my house in the evening, serenaded me, and shouted: 'Hurrah for\r\nthe champion of German liberty!'... What will my critics say to this,\r\nthose critics who called me a bad patriot? Public opinion does not\r\nallow itself to be misled.\" Absurdly enough, with all this enthusiasm,\r\nhis watch was stolen at the Hambach festival.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 27th of May, the enormous procession made its\r\nway from Neustadt to the ruins of the castle of Hambach. Every one\r\nwore black, red, and gold colours, and black, red, and gold flags were\r\ncarried in front of the procession, the ranks of which were swelled\r\nby a great number of women, wearing black, red, and gold belts.\r\nSiebenpfeiffer and the Bavarian Liberal journalist, Wirth, were the\r\nprincipal speakers. They proclaimed the sovereignty of the people to\r\nbe the foundation on which every state must rest, and declared that\r\nGermany would ere long be a republic. All the speeches made were\r\nviolent, and all described the degradation of Germany as the work of\r\nher sovereigns, in combination with the aristocrats. Wirth proposed\r\nthe toast (for which he had afterwards to do penance by a long\r\nimprisonment) of \"The united free states of Germany,\" and \"federated\r\nrepublican Europe,\" and shouted as he waved the sword of honour that\r\nhad been presented to him: \"Accursed, three times accursed be the\r\nrulers of Germany!\" These words were re-echoed by part of the assembly;\r\nthere were shouts of: \"Down with kings and princes! To arms! To arms!\"\r\n\r\nThe participators in the Hambach festival had, however, no immediate,\r\npractical aim in view. Supposing the moment to have been favourable--a\r\ntolerably doubtful supposition--they allowed it to pass without taking\r\nadvantage of it.\r\n\r\nHeine writes humorously and bitterly: \"I dare hardly tell the story, it\r\nseems so incredible, yet I have it from a reliable source, from a man\r\nwho is an honest and truthful republican, and was himself a member of\r\nthe committee at Hambach which deliberated on the impending revolution.\r\nThis man told me in confidence that, when it came to the question of\r\ncompetence, to a dispute as to whether the patriots then assembled at\r\nHambach were really competent to begin a revolution in the name of the\r\nwhole of Germany, those who advised immediate action were outvoted, and\r\nthe conclusion arrived at was that they were incompetent.\" Heine calls\r\nthis the best story he has ever heard, good enough to make him forget\r\nall the troubles of this vale of tears, and even to cheer him after\r\ndeath in the dusky tedium of the realm of shades. Then he speaks words\r\nof comfort to kings and princes, tells them how it is quite unnecessary\r\nthat they should imprison any more worthy citizens; they may sleep in\r\npeace; they are in no danger; the German revolution is still far off;\r\nthe question of competence is not yet decided.[8]\r\n\r\nFor many years after he made Heine's literary and personal\r\nacquaintance, Börne's feeling towards that author was a friendly one;\r\nhe spoke of him with affection, gave him his full due as a poet, and\r\nmore especially appreciated him as a great power in the service of\r\nuniversal emancipation. But their natures were too unlike to permit\r\nof his judgment being quite unprejudiced. From 1831 onwards we come\r\nupon spiteful references to Heine in the Letters. Although Börne was\r\ndevoid of petty vanity, the frequent comparisons made between Heine\r\nand himself rankled in his mind, especially as, in the matter of\r\nability and gifts, they were often to his disadvantage. And Heine's\r\n_Französische Zustände_ (\"The Situation in France\") offended and\r\nwounded him; its perusal roused in him a feeling of ill-humour to\r\nwhich he gave vent (in the last volume of the _Letters from Paris_)\r\nin cutting satire, which struck Heine as it were from above, and, in\r\nthe eyes of many readers, stamped him with the brand of political\r\nuntrustworthiness.\r\n\r\nIt was in reality the deep-seated antagonism between the natures of\r\nthe two fellow-combatants that found vent on this occasion. Börne\r\ndid not understand the real nature of the difference between himself\r\nand Heine. To him it seemed to be the difference between manly\r\nearnestness and boyish frivolity, or, taken in its highest aspect,\r\nbetween devotion to truth and devotion to form, to art. With accurate\r\nperception he detected and exposed some of the small puerilities and\r\nsnobberies of which Heine, when dazzled by the tinsel of life, could\r\nat a time be guilty, and also some of his unjust mockeries of ideal\r\nendeavour clothed in clumsy or naïvely popular form. Börne detested\r\nthe Rothschilds, by whom Heine was impressed and fascinated. Börne,\r\nwho felt out of his element in drawing-rooms, was quite at home among\r\ndemocratic artisans, and in gatherings of German emigrants, no matter\r\nhow wild the schemes they planned, or how unpractical the undertakings\r\nfor which they collected money; Heine, on the contrary, was annoyed\r\nby the constant solicitations to support this or that democratic\r\nundertaking, was quite unsuited to be a member of the democratic\r\nfraternity, preferred, in spite of his revolutionary leanings, to keep\r\nhimself to himself, and had no intention whatever of being on terms of\r\nhail fellow well met with any chance band of emigrant fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated the 25th of February 1833, Börne jeers at Heine\r\nfor various things, amongst others for writing of the inhuman policy\r\npursued by Austria for the last three hundred years as \"sublime\r\nperseverance\"; for calling King Louis of Bavaria, whom he afterwards\r\nso unmercifully satirised, \"one of the noblest and most intellectual\r\nmonarchs that ever sat upon a throne\"; and for declaring it to be\r\n\"courageous and admirable\" of the Messrs. Rothschild to remain in Paris\r\nduring the cholera, while he, at the same time, casts ridicule on the\r\nunpaid exertions of the German patriots. On these points, and others,\r\nBörne is right, but nevertheless he shows no delicate discernment or\r\nprofound comprehension of Heine's real character.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Heine, as in the case of Goethe, he stood face to face\r\nwith a genius he was unable to judge impartially, though he by no means\r\nwronged his restless contemporary to the same extent or in the same\r\nmanner as he did his great predecessor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Stock expressions: \"O, es ist zum Rasendwerden! (it is maddening!)\r\nO, ich habe eine Wuth! (I am in a transport of rage!).\" On the subject\r\nof the encyclopædia: \"Eine starke halbe Stunde musste ich das Schreiben\r\nunterbrechen, und meine Wuth war grenzenlos.\" (I had to stop writing\r\nfor a good half hour, and was infuriated beyond all bounds.)\r\n\r\n[2] \"Was, wo, worauf, womit soll ich schreiben? Der Boden zittert, es\r\nzittert der Tisch, das Pult, Hand und Herz zittern, und die Geschichte,\r\nvom Sturme bewegt, zittert selbst.... Prophet wollte ich sein zwölf\r\nBände durch.\"--What, where, upon what, with what am I to write? The\r\nground, the table, the desk, hand and heart tremble, shaken by the\r\nhurricane, history itself trembles.... A prophet I would be, throughout\r\ntwelve volumes.\r\n\r\n[3] _Börne_, iii. 75, 86, 172; 43, 99, 267.\r\n\r\n[4] _Börne_, iii. 159, 160.\r\n\r\n[5] _Börne_, 98, 39, 270.\r\n\r\n[6] \"Und mit Zehn Ellen Hanf wäre der Welt Friede, Glück, und Ruhe zu\r\ngeben.\"\r\n\r\n[7] \"Das einzige Volk im Norden, das seit dreihundert Jahren nie\r\naufgehört sich für die Freiheit zu erheben, ist das polnische, und es\r\nblieb katholisch.\"\r\n\r\nThe one nation of the North that for three hundred years has not ceased\r\nto make a stand for liberty, is Poland, and Poland remained Catholic.\r\n\r\n[8] Heine: _Sämmtliche Werke_, xii. 153.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nHEINE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Heinrich Heine also, as already observed, the present moment in\r\nthe development of the new German Empire is an unfavourable one.\r\nHe is reproached with so much, that it is difficult to summarise.\r\nFirst there is his infatuation for France, and his supposed or real\r\nfrivolity; then his un-German extraction and wit, his sentimentality,\r\nhis foppery, his wantonness; and lastly, the defiant manner in\r\nwhich he parades his irreligion. New Germany is indifferent in\r\nreligious matters, but tacitly so, and in the matter of morals it is\r\nthoroughly disciplined. In the Germany of to-day the highest virtues,\r\ntruthfulness, independence, high spirit, and sensitiveness, are of much\r\nless account than dutifulness, correctness, social discipline, military\r\nsmartness--_Schneidigkeit_, as it is called. In Heine's time the\r\nopposite was the case. No value was put on discipline. Piety counted\r\nfor more than religion, humanity for more than patriotism. The best\r\nmen of those days did not regard patriotism as an unqualified virtue;\r\nnor did they consider that justice ceased to be a virtue when shown to\r\nanother nation.\r\n\r\nTo an abstract Radical bent of mind there was added in Heine's case the\r\nhatred of Prussia, whose future he did not foresee, whose strength he\r\ndid not realize--that strength of which Carlyle gives us the best idea\r\nin his delineation of the father of Frederick the Great, a strength\r\nwhich lay in the ability, by means of sober severity, to conquer chaos,\r\ncrush all foolish opposition, and rule. Heine's was no undefined\r\ndislike, it was the Rhinelander's mortal enmity to Prussia. Read his\r\nlines to the Prussian eagle:\r\n\r\n   \"Du hässlicher Vogel! wirst du einst,\r\n    Mir in die Hände fallen,\r\n    So rupfe ich dir die Federn aus\r\n    Und haue dir ab die Krallen.\r\n\r\n    Du sollst mir dann in luft'ger Höh'\r\n    Auf einer Stange sitzen\r\n    Und ich rufe zum lustigen Schiessen herbei\r\n    Die _rheinischen_ Bogenschützen.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAt the Congress of Vienna, after repeatedly refusing, Prussia at last\r\nconsented to take over the Rhine Provinces. Instead of the rounding\r\noff of her frontier in the east for which she had hoped, she thus\r\nacquired territory at a distance, and came to rule over a race of\r\nGermans totally unlike the Old-Prussians. This Rhine Province was the\r\nregion where, in days gone by, the line of separation between Kelts\r\nand Germans lay. Most of it had been included in the Roman military\r\nprovince. At a later period the land came under priestly rule,\r\nwhich accounts for the fact that it was in no way influenced in the\r\neighteenth century by the spirit of Frederick the Great. Old, decaying\r\nclericalism came here into direct contact with the French Revolution,\r\nand the propagators of the revolutionary ideas were joyfully welcomed.\r\n\r\nThe Old-Prussian's feeling towards the Rhinelanders was the distrust\r\nof antipathy, a feeling the Rhinelanders returned with interest. At\r\nthe Rhine the Prussians were, and continued to be strangers, unwelcome\r\nstrangers. When he spoke of a son serving in the army, the Rhinelander\r\nsaid: \"He is with the Prussians.\" The government official transferred\r\nfrom Berlin to Cologne or Düsseldorf put on airs, and disparaged\r\neverything, and the Rhinelander long regarded a transfer to one of the\r\nold Prussian provinces as a sort of exile to Siberia. Complaints were\r\nheard everywhere of Prussia's inability to gain the affections of the\r\npeoples she had conquered.[2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEINRICH HEINE]\r\n\r\nHeinrich Heine was born near the close of the century at Düsseldorf,\r\nthen capital of the duchy of Jülich-Cleve-Berg. For six years the\r\ntown was garrisoned by French revolutionary troops. They took their\r\ndeparture in 1801, and Max Joseph of Pfalz-Zweibrücken became Grand\r\nDuke; but in 1806 he was made King of Bavaria, and Joachim Murat was\r\ninstalled as Grand Duke in his stead. Only two years later Murat had to\r\nmake way for the eldest son of the King of Holland, or, in reality, as\r\nthe boy was not of age, for Napoleon, as his guardian. The country was\r\nnow governed exactly according to the French pattern; serfdom, feudal\r\nlaw, and statute-labour were abolished, and complete religious liberty\r\nwas proclaimed. This last innovation led to Napoleon's being revered by\r\nthe Jewish population of the Rhine Provinces as their saviour from the\r\noppression of a thousand years.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the contact with the audacious, victorious\r\nFrenchmen of that day powerfully influenced Heine's mental development.\r\nHis respect for traditional authority was early undermined. His natural\r\nwit was developed in the direction of what the French call _esprit_.\r\nThe germs of his enthusiastic admiration for Napoleon were generated.\r\nThat enthusiasm seems to us to-day to be an isolated phenomenon in the\r\nGerman literature of the century; in reality it was very far from being\r\nso.\r\n\r\nLet us go back to Wieland, and we shall find that he held Napoleon\r\nin the same high estimation, even before such an opinion had been\r\njustified by the events of history. In 1798 he declares that France\r\nstands in need of a dictator, and that no one is fit for the post\r\nexcept General Bonaparte, then in Egypt. In 1800 he prophesies that\r\nBonaparte will and must make himself king, and defends him against the\r\nattacks of the English newspapers. Napoleon, having been told of these\r\nprophecies, had a lengthy interview with Wieland at Erfurt in 1808.\r\n\r\nNone of the great Germans at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century knew what national enmity meant. It was without\r\na spark of any such feeling that Goethe, in the capacity of spectator,\r\nmade the campaign of 1793 in France. Schiller valued his certificate of\r\nFrench citizenship, and believed that it might come to be of use to his\r\nchildren. Knebel, Goethe's friend, wished that he dared sing Napoleon's\r\nvictories. Goethe himself looked on with complacency while Napoleon\r\nshattered the kingdom of Frederick the Great into fragments; it is\r\nevident that he must have regarded that kingdom of Prussia as a passing\r\nphenomenon in the history of Germany. He had witnessed Napoleon's rise\r\nand victorious career, and had seen him suppress that anarchy which\r\nwas so hateful to himself, the aristocrat and evolutionist. At last he\r\nmade his personal acquaintance, saw him surrounded by his marshals,\r\nin an atmosphere of brightness, amiability, geniality, general\r\nirresistibility. The personal impression made upon him by Napoleon was\r\nsuch as to increase his previous admiration for him. Hence it was that\r\neven after the Russian campaign, even during the rehabilitation of\r\nGermany, Goethe continued to say: \"It is all of no use; the man is too\r\nstrong for them.\" It was not till all was over that he made a sort of\r\ncompulsory amends by writing a play for the fête on the occasion of the\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nGoethe's valuation of Napoleon has been the subject of much discussion;\r\nless well known is the impression which the great Frenchman made on\r\nHegel, who, as Heine's teacher and chosen philosopher, influenced\r\nhim quite as much as Goethe. Hegel was born a subject of the small,\r\ndespotically-ruled State of Würtemberg. He longed for a fatherland, but\r\nhad never known what it was to have one, and in the beginning of the\r\ncentury he was so embittered by the situation in Germany, and roused\r\nto such anger and scorn by the political stupidity of his countrymen,\r\nthat he, like Goethe, welcomed Napoleon with the unqualified enthusiasm\r\nof a cosmopolitan. He had spent his youth dreaming of a possible\r\nreconciliation of the real with the ideal, but had never come into\r\ncontact with a real living power until Napoleon crossed his path and\r\naroused his enthusiasm. It was said of Goethe that he took advantage\r\nof the distraction caused by the roar of the cannon at Jena to marry\r\nChristiane Vulpius without rousing remark; of Hegel it was said that\r\nhe finished his work _Die Phænomenologie des Geistes_ (\"Philosophy of\r\nMind\") in Jena itself, while the battle was raging. It is a fact that\r\nit was exactly at this time that he despatched the last pages of the\r\nwork to his publisher; and there is a very striking contrast between\r\nhis calm indifference to the ruin of Prussia and his keen anxiety lest\r\nany of the precious packets of manuscript should be lost in transit at\r\nthat unsettled time. A letter to his publisher, which accompanied one\r\nof the packets, bears the date of the battle.\r\n\r\nIn the work, to which the finishing touches were put under such\r\ncircumstances, Hegel expounded his theory of the development of the\r\nhuman mind with a curious mixture of historical and psychological\r\nargument. He maintained that humanity had now reached its goal, that\r\nsuch individual mortals as had attained to the highest degree of\r\nunderstanding, now possessed the insight of gods, that their lives,\r\nlives of far-reaching influence, were now simply the harmonious\r\nunfolding of an existence such as the Greeks imagined that of their\r\ngods to be, absolutely contented, absolutely reconciled. While Hegel\r\nwas writing his concluding words, which are to the effect that history\r\nis but a play of the spirit that is conscious of itself as spirit,\r\nNapoleon drew rein at the gates of Jena.\r\n\r\nAnd Hegel saw him, and seeing him, rejoiced. \"I have seen the emperor,\r\nthat soul of the world,\" he writes from Jena. \"It truly gives one a\r\nstrange feeling to see one such single individual who, concentrated\r\non a single point, sitting on his horse here in Jena, influences and\r\nrules the world. As far as the Prussians are concerned, nothing better\r\ncould have been prognosticated--but only such a man could have made\r\nsuch way between Thursday and Monday; it is impossible to refuse him\r\nadmiration.\" And it is not only the emperor Hegel admires, but the\r\nwhole French people. Three months later he writes that in the history\r\nof the day he sees convincing proof that culture overcomes barbarism,\r\nthat intellect overcomes unintellectuality. And he even adds: \"I have\r\nlong wished the French army success, now all do so; nor can it fail to\r\nbe successful, considering the enormous difference between its leaders\r\nand soldiers and those of the enemy.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIf Heine had ever imagined that his enthusiasm for Napoleon required\r\nany apology, he might have found one in the fact that he was but\r\nfollowing in the footsteps of the man whom he invariably spoke of\r\nwith reverence as \"the great Hegel, the greatest philosopher Germany\r\nhas produced since Leibnitz,\" the man of whom he makes the very\r\nquestionable assertion that he quite unquestionably \"towers high\r\nabove Kant,\" and whom he criticises with such lenient and gentle\r\ndisparagement as the following utterance conveys: \"Hegel allowed\r\nhimself to be crowned in Berlin, and alas, to be anointed too.\"\r\n\r\nNot only Heine's great models and teachers, but contemporaries like\r\nVarnhagen von Ense, who had actually shed his blood in the war against\r\nNapoleon, shared his enthusiasm, and were equally free from patriotic\r\nenmity to France. Of the Dane Baggesen, who, half German by nature, was\r\nfain to be more German than the Germans, Varnhagen writes: \"His hatred\r\nof Napoleon and the French is peculiarly offensive; it is an aversion\r\nwhich amounts to loathing, and yet it is groundless, for all that is\r\ngood in us Germans, all that we are proudest of in ourselves, he holds\r\nin horror and would fain suppress with the help of Kant, Jacobi, Voss,\r\nand Klopstock.\" Kant is evidently included in this list on account of\r\nthe very un-German \"categorical imperative,\" the others on account of\r\nthe extreme narrowness of their patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe cult of Napoleon is thus, we see, to be traced in the words and\r\nworks of the men who had the greatest influence on Heine's development\r\nand on that of young Germany in general.\r\n\r\nIt inspired Heine's muse several years before it became epidemic in\r\nFrance, and Heine rises to an equal height of enthusiasm with Beyle\r\nand Hugo. It is not too much to say that the poetic expression of this\r\nenthusiasm in his youthful poem _The Two Grenadiers_ (which he probably\r\nwrote at the age of eighteen, though he himself claims to have written\r\nit at sixteen) surpasses anything of the same nature that exists\r\nin French. Not even Béranger's _Souvenirs du Peuple_ is so simply\r\ngrand, although it, better than any other poem, has given tangible\r\nand touching expression to the French popular Napoleonic legend. In\r\nHeine's _Grenadiers_ the rhythm of each line answers exactly to its\r\nmood and matter--the mournful iambics: _Der Andre sprach: das Lied\r\nist aus_; the fiery anapæsts: _Dann reitet mein Kaiser wohl über mein\r\nGrab_. The grenadier's impossible request to his comrade to carry his\r\ncorpse to France passes almost unnoticed. The wildness of the principal\r\nstrophe: _Was schert mich Weib, was schert mich Kind_, the grenadier's\r\nprotest against the supposition that he is tied by the wife and child\r\nhe has left at home, contrasts forcibly with the sentimentality of the\r\nRomantic style. It is only ostensibly that this poem glorifies fidelity\r\nto Napoleon personally; what it really glorifies is loving fidelity to\r\nthe great leader, unbounded enthusiasm for the great personality.\r\n\r\nThe gift of describing by means of introducing characters into lyric\r\npoetry was common to both Béranger and Heine. But Béranger was a\r\nsong-writer, Heine a genius. _The Two Grenadiers_ begins, as Heine\r\nalmost always begins, quietly, smoothly. Nothing could be more unlike\r\nthis than Victor Hugo's lyric attack: _Lui! toujours lui!_ Heine does\r\nnot produce his effect by direct representation, but by delineation\r\nof the less important, of the small things in which the great are\r\nreflected, and which provide a standard to gauge them by; then at last,\r\nfollowing on and issuing from the simple dialogue, comes the burst of\r\nvisionary enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThat the object of this worship was hardly worthy of it, does not make\r\nthe feeling itself less admirable. It is a feeling of exactly the same\r\nkind that Heine describes in the _Reisebilder_, when he tells how, as a\r\nchild, he saw Napoleon riding through the ducal garden in Düsseldorf.\r\nThe chapter begins: \"But what were my feelings when I saw himself, saw\r\nhim with my own highly-favoured eyes, himself, Hosannah! the Emperor!\"\r\nNote the _Hosannah!_ In the moment of ecstasy, the recollections of\r\nchildhood bring the Old Testament cry of salutation and rejoicing to\r\nhis lips. And what did the child think on the occasion? He remembered\r\nthat it was forbidden, under a penalty of five thalers, to ride through\r\nthe avenue. And, lo and behold! there was the emperor, with all his\r\nofficers, riding straight through--the shuddering trees bent forward as\r\nhe passed....\r\n\r\nAs a political poet, Heine is considered to be revolutionary, and so\r\nhe was. But his political animosity is exclusively aroused by medieval\r\nconditions, medieval beliefs. He is anti-clerical in good earnest,\r\nbut not democratic in good earnest. His longest political poem,\r\n_Deutschland, ein Wintermärchen_, (\"Germany, a Winter's Tale\"), gives\r\nabundant evidence of this. It rises to real passion only where the\r\npoet's invisible companion, the lictor with the terrible axe, breaks\r\nup the skeletons of the Three Kings in the Cathedral of Cologne, \"the\r\nmiserable skeletons of superstition.\" But it is in this great poem,\r\nHeine's most important work, that we have the clearest expression of\r\nthe political feelings and principles which animated him, the element,\r\nnew to German poetry, of warlike challenge and hand-to-hand struggle.\r\nNothing of the kind is to be found in Goethe. In the end, indeed,\r\nGoethe was persuaded of \"the absolute pitiableness of the time,\" but\r\nhe feared that the overthrow of existing authorities would only make\r\nthings worse. Not even in Schiller can we find any direct reference to\r\nthe politics of the day. His political feeling finds a vent in dramas\r\nwhose theme is liberty. But in Heine, from 1830 onwards, we have always\r\nthis direct expression of the faith that was in him. His soul was\r\nin politics. And in politics he was honest, even in cases where his\r\nhonesty was misunderstood.\r\n\r\nTurn to that passage in the _Reisebilder_ which is most frequently\r\ncited as an expression of his boastfulness and affectation, the\r\npassage following on the description of his visit to the battlefield\r\nof Marengo: \"'This will be a fine day,' called my travelling\r\ncompanion.--Yes, it will be a fine day, silently echoed my heart,\r\nuplifted in prayer, trembling with sadness and joyfulness. Yes, it will\r\nbe a fine day, and the sun of liberty will gladden the earth. A new\r\ngeneration will spring up and flourish, begotten in free embrace, not\r\nin a prison bed, under the control of clerical warders; and this free\r\nbirth will generate free thoughts and feelings, of which we born serfs\r\nhave not even a presentiment ...\" then at the end these words: \"I know\r\nnot if I deserve that a laurel wreath should one day be laid on my\r\ncoffin. Poetry, dearly as I have loved it; has always been to me but a\r\ndivine plaything, or a weapon consecrated to divine purposes.... But\r\nlay on my coffin a _sword_, for I was a brave soldier in the Liberation\r\nWar of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nThis political warfare of Heine's is spoken of with the utmost contempt\r\nby German historians of literature, historians proper, and literary\r\ncritics; not only by Menzel, but by such men as Goedeke, Treitschke,\r\nGrisebach (Heine's imitator and denouncer), and Hehn, whose perception\r\nin other cases is so remarkably acute. Even Scherer is cold and\r\ndepreciatory. When the Italian poet Carducci some years ago celebrated\r\nHeine in an ode as a hero in the struggle of liberty, even Karl\r\nHillebrand, the best literary critic in Germany, who had at one time\r\nbeen Heine's secretary, and had always spoken of him with reverence\r\nand admiration, made a sort of protest, declaring that Heine himself\r\nhad never taken the thing so seriously. This disfavour and distrust is\r\nnot surprising. The frivolity in Heine's character led in his youth\r\nto repellent political vacillation. In 1827, in the hope of being\r\nappointed to a professorship at Munich, he was ready to disown his\r\nprevious principles to please King Louis, but gained nothing by it. He\r\noffered at the same time to defend the wretched Duke of Brunswick, the\r\ndiamond-Duke, in return for a Brunswick order; but in this case also he\r\nwas disappointed. It was not till 1830 that he began to show political\r\nstrength of character.\r\n\r\nWe must also remember that in Heine's writings there is an absence of\r\nall \"pathetic gesture.\" He was too proud to employ it. Germans cannot\r\nunderstand this. But grievous wrong is done him. The pathos was in his\r\nsoul. His whole soul is in the little poem _Enfant Perdu_, with which\r\none of the divisions of _Romancero_ concludes, and which he wrote when\r\nhe was no longer young. He really was what he here calls himself, an\r\nadvanced and forgotten outpost, left to be shot down. And when, in his\r\nposthumous prose hymn, he cries: \"I am the sword, I am flame,\" it is\r\nbut the truth. The light of his flame, the sparks of his sword-blows,\r\nstill shine bright. Many still warm themselves at his fire.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, Börne, in his _Letters from Paris_, calls Heine\r\nan inconsistent, vacillating, characterless politician. He does not\r\nso much reproach him with overrating himself personally as with\r\noverrating the influence of the individual human being. For it is\r\nBörne's opinion that the individual is no longer of much importance.\r\nEven a Voltaire or a Rousseau would not be a powerful influence\r\nnowadays. Individuals are now merely the heralds of the people. This\r\nHeine forgets. Then, in his desire to please the democrats, he declares\r\nthat the Jesuitic-aristocratic party in Germany malign him because he\r\nmakes a bold stand against absolutism; but almost at the same time, in\r\norder to curry favour with the aristocrats, says that he has made a\r\nstand against Jacobinism, and that he is, and always will be, a good\r\nmonarchist.\r\n\r\nBörne does not always understand a joke. Heine gives a droll account of\r\na Paris millinery establishment which he frequented the summer before\r\nhe writes, where he, as a royalist, was one against sixteen, the eight\r\nyoung shop-girls and their eight lovers being all violently aggressive\r\nrepublicans. Elsewhere he writes: \"God knows I am no Republican. I know\r\nthat when the Republicans are victorious, they will cut off my head ...\r\na piece of foolishness for which I am quite ready to forgive them.\"\r\nBörne adds: \"Not I. A lunatic asylum would be the proper place for\r\nRepublicans that were such fools as to suppose that it was necessary to\r\nget rid of Heine in order to attain their aims.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of their jesting tone, there is something in these and similar\r\nutterances of Heine's which puzzles the reader. Intermittent outbursts\r\nof violent Radicalism, everywhere an undertone of the most pronounced\r\nrevolutionary feeling--and these constantly recurring assurances that\r\nhe is not a Jacobin, not even a Republican.\r\n\r\nAn explanation is required, an explanation which no one has yet offered.\r\n\r\nFor to say that Heine was characterless, characterless to such a\r\ndegree, that in the most serious matters, and with the eyes of two\r\ngreat nations upon him, he perpetually contradicted himself, is no\r\nexplanation at all. The vagueness, the contradiction must lie in his\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nRemember his faithful, boundless devotion to Napoleon, which once more\r\nand for the last time finds expression in the _Winter's Tale_, in the\r\ndirge of the dead emperor, brought in his coffin from St. Helena to\r\nParis:\r\n\r\n    \"Die elysäischen Felder entlang,\r\n     Durch des Triumphes Bogen,\r\n     Wohl durch den Nebel, wohl über den Schnee\r\n     Kam langsam der Zug gezogen....\"[4]\r\n\r\nAnd then think of the scene (from the _Reisebilder_) on the battlefield\r\nof Marengo. The Russian asks Heine: \"Are you a good Russian?\" And\r\nHeine answers: \"Yes, I am a good Russian.\" For, he goes on to explain,\r\nthe incessant change of war-cries and of representatives in the great\r\nstruggle has now led to this--that the most enthusiastic friends of\r\nthe Revolution look for the salvation of the world from the domination\r\nof Russia, look upon the Emperor Nicholas as the standard-bearer of\r\nliberty in Europe. The Russian government is permeated with Liberal\r\nideas, its absolutism is simply a dictatorship, which gives it the\r\npower to put these ideas into practice, &c, &c.\r\n\r\nThe mistake is colossal in its simplicity. But for our present purpose\r\nthis is of no consequence. What interests us is the fact that Russian\r\nabsolutism, thus understood by Heine, received from him the same\r\nmeasure of approval and sympathy as he had formerly bestowed on the\r\nrule of Napoleon. Give this due consideration. Heine, the most advanced\r\nrepresentative of Radicalism among the poets of his time, declares\r\nthe Emperor Nicholas, the most tyrannical autocrat of his time, to be\r\nthe standard-bearer of liberty! Can this be the same man who took a\r\nchildish pleasure in invariably associating in his mind the thought of\r\nroyal or imperial rank with the thought of the guillotine? Remember his\r\nwords to Barbarossa: \"Du wirst hier an ein Brett geschnallt--das senkt\r\nsich, &c, &c.\" (They fasten you to a plank--it is lowered, &c), and the\r\nconcluding apostrophe to the venerable old emperor: \"Die Republikaner\r\nlachen uns aus--sehn sie an unserer Spitze--so ein Gespenst mit Scepter\r\nund Krön.\" (The Republicans will laugh us to scorn, if they see us led\r\nby an old spectre like you, with sceptre and crown). We see that he\r\nsets some value on the opinion of the Republicans, sees things to a\r\ncertain extent from their standpoint.\r\n\r\nOr again, think of that extraordinarily witty poem \"1649-1793-?\" which\r\nfirst treats of the short and sharp justice meted out to kings in the\r\nEnglish and French Revolutions, and then prophesies the impending\r\nGerman revolution, but declares that:\r\n\r\n   \"Der Deutsche wird die Majestät\r\n    Behandeln stets mit Pietät.\r\n    In einer sechsspännigen Hofkarosse,\r\n    Schwarz panaschirt und beflort die Rosse--\r\n    Hoch auf dem Bock mit der Trauerpeitsche\r\n    Der weinende Kutscher--so wird der deutsche\r\n    Monarch einst nach dem Richtplatz kutschirt,\r\n    Und unterthänigst guillotinirt.\"[5]\r\n\r\nIf this is not simply playing with words and with feelings, there\r\nmust be an explanation of it, a key to it which Heine himself did\r\nnot possess. For that there is self-contradiction in such words is\r\nundeniable.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is that Heine was at one and the same time a\r\npassionate lover of liberty and an out-and-out aristocrat. He had\r\nthe freedom-loving nature's thirst for liberty, pined and languished\r\nfor it, and loved it with his whole soul; but he had also the great\r\nnature's admiration for human greatness, and the refined nature's\r\nnervous horror of the rule of mediocrity.\r\n\r\nIn other words, there was not a drop of conservative blood in Heinrich\r\nHeine's heart. His blood was revolutionary. But neither was there a\r\ndrop of democratic blood in his heart. His blood was aristocratic, his\r\ndesire was to see genius acknowledged as leader and ruler.\r\n\r\nWhen, in his historical retrospects or previsions, he sees a worthless\r\nking or emperor guillotined, he applauds. But he would give to Cæsar\r\nthat which is Cæsar's. _Apodote ta Kaisaros Kaisari_ is the saying of\r\nJesus which is most deeply engraved on his mind. He does not dread a\r\ncondition of liberty, to which any liberty we have yet known on earth\r\nis child's play; but he does not believe that liberty would result\r\nfrom the realisation of the Philistine ideals of the average mind. All\r\nmediocrity, Liberal and Republican mediocrity included, he abhors, as\r\ninimical to great individuality, to great liberty.\r\n\r\nHence his distrust of the North American Republic, his want of\r\nenthusiasm for its liberty:\r\n\r\n   \"Manchmal kommt mir in den Sinn\r\n    Nach Amerika zu segeln,\r\n    Nach dem grossen Freiheitsstall,\r\n    Der bewohnt von Gleichheitsflegeln....\"[6]\r\n\r\nIf Heine adores the _Marseillaise_, it is because the _Marseillaise_\r\nis to him the symbol of the great revolt. If he worships Napoleon,\r\nit is because Napoleon is the over-thrower of kings and of the old\r\norder of the world; and if, in Napoleon's case, he overlooks all that\r\nis inimical to liberty, it is because Napoleon is in his eyes the\r\nrepresentative of the people, free from any suspicion of democratic\r\nmediocrity.\r\n\r\nIt is only at a rare time, when he is despondent, when he is not\r\nhimself, but is making use of a borrowed formula, that Heine commits\r\nhimself to the foolish, plebeian assertion that the power of the great\r\npersonality is a thing of the past--a theory which is in reality\r\nnothing but the classic expression of middle-class envy. In his heart\r\nof hearts Heine is so convinced of the contrary that he can go to the\r\nmad extreme of imagining Nicholas, the obdurate representative of the\r\nprinciple of coercion, to be the chief champion of liberty in Europe.\r\nBut Nicholas was at least a personality, a power. And Heine was genius\r\nenough to feel that in the last instance personalities and powers are\r\nthe only things that count. Numbers do not, neither do monarchs, not\r\neven in quantities. Hence Heine's standing joke on the subject of the\r\nthree dozen German monarchs.\r\n\r\nWhat Heine dreaded was perhaps in the first place a life without\r\nbeauty. Fourier's Phalanstery, the great home of labour, where\r\neverything, down to the beer, is equally distributed, where there is no\r\nroom for any superfluity, not even for the superfluity which is known\r\nby the name of art, seemed to him to be inevitable in the future, but\r\ndid not satisfy him.\r\n\r\nBut still more repugnant to him was a life without all greatness,\r\nwith equality in mediocrity as its religion, and hatred to genius, to\r\ninquiring minds, to those who openly discard Nazarene asceticism, as\r\nits only real morality. And equally repugnant to him was society as\r\nhe knew it, dominated by an unintellectual clergy and an unrefined\r\naristocracy, and society as he foresaw it, composed of emancipated\r\nslave souls, who had only exchanged the servility which was their\r\ninstinct for free indulgence in the envy which lay at the root of all\r\ntheir morality.\r\n\r\nHe certainly took part with those who rose in revolution against Louis\r\nXVI., that worthy locksmith who became a king. But he as certainly took\r\npart with Cæsar against Brutus, that dunce of a usurer, who could do\r\nnothing but stick a knife into a great man.\r\n\r\nHeine imagined himself to be a monarchist; he called himself so from\r\nsincere conviction, because he was a Cæsarian, and had not the word to\r\nexpress it. He imagined himself to be a democrat, and called himself\r\nso; because he was born a plebeian, hated all unjust privileges of\r\nbirth, and felt himself in eternal opposition to the squirearchy and\r\nthe clergy. But in his inmost soul he was consistent. The apparent\r\ncontradiction in his political sympathies and tendencies arose from the\r\nfact that he loved greatness and beauty as truly as he loved liberty,\r\nand that he was not prepared to sacrifice the highest development of\r\nhumanity on the altar of unreal equality and real mediocrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] If I ever get hold of thee, thou ugly bird, I will pluck out thy\r\nfeathers and cut off thy claws, perch thee high in air on a pole, and\r\ncall the archers of the Rhineland to the merry shooting-match.\r\n\r\n[2] K. Mendelssohn-Bartholdy: _Preussen und Frankreich zur Zeit der\r\nJulirevolution_, p. 25, &c.\r\n\r\n[3] Haym: _Hegel und seine Zeit_.\r\n\r\n[5] The German will ever treat royalty with respect. 'Tis in a carriage\r\nof state, drawn by six horses with sable plumes and trappings--on the\r\nbox a weeping coachman with crape-bound whip--that the German monarch\r\nwill be driven to the place of execution, and there most submissively\r\nguillotined.\r\n\r\n[6] At times the fancy takes me to set sail for America, that great\r\nliberty-stable, where the equality-bumpkins congregate....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nHEINE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems most probable that Heinrich Heine was born on the 13th of\r\nDecember 1797. His father, Samson Heine of Hanover, as a young man\r\ntook part in a campaign in Flanders and Brabant, in the capacity of\r\nquartermaster (with the rank of an officer) to the Duke of Cumberland,\r\nbut after his marriage with Peira (Betty) von Geldern, settled down\r\nas a merchant in Düsseldorf. He was a handsome, placid, grave man,\r\nwithout much ability, even as a merchant. He had no taste for art or\r\npoetry, but he had a childish love of a fine uniform, and aristocratic\r\ntastes for gambling, actresses, dogs, and horses. He is said to have\r\ntaken twelve horses with him when he removed to Düsseldorf. The poet's\r\nmother was a woman of keen intelligence and deep feeling, and was very\r\nmusical. She had received a good education, spoke French and English as\r\nfluently as German, was a disciple of Rousseau, whose _Émile_ she had\r\nstudied, and an admirer of Goethe. She early rebelled against prejudice\r\nand conventionality, and differed from her husband, who reverenced\r\nNapoleon, in being an ardent patriot. Education was her hobby, and she\r\ntaught her children with great care and patience. Both parents were\r\nfree-thinkers in the matter of religion--the father indifferent, the\r\nmother a deist; but they brought up their children in the observance of\r\nthe old Jewish ritual.\r\n\r\nAfter a short time at a Jewish school for young children, where, it may\r\nbe, the foundation was laid for that knowledge of the Bible which is\r\nso conspicuous in his writings, Heinrich was placed in an educational\r\nestablishment carried on in an old Franciscan monastery by French\r\necclesiastics, principally Jesuits, who were at the same time educated\r\nmen of the world. He had had a happy childhood in his home, and at\r\nschool, too, he found friends and protectors, who took his part when\r\nhis religion or his mocking tongue threatened to get him into trouble.\r\n\r\nThe earliest noticeable peculiarity in the future poet was a\r\nnervousness, which steadily grew upon him, and which showed itself in\r\nthe disagreeable and even painful effect produced in him by any kind of\r\nnoise. Piano-playing and loud talk, at times even his sister's sweet,\r\nmelodious voice, affected him as screaming affects ordinary nerves. And\r\nhis sense of smell was as acute as his hearing. From a child he, like\r\nGoethe, loathed tobacco smoke. He had no taste for music, and never\r\nlearned to dance. At fifteen he began to write good verse.\r\n\r\nThe Rhineland, with its joyousness, but also with its superstition,\r\ntradition, and legend; the Catholic worship of these parts, with its\r\nmedieval buildings and ceremonies and pilgrimages, over which the\r\nRomantic poetry of the day cast a transfiguring halo; the impressions\r\nproduced by Jewish descent, by the poetry of the Bible, and by the\r\ncraving for liberty, and the self-contempt engendered in the Jews\r\nby oppression; the enthusiasm for the French and for Napoleon, and\r\nafterwards, following quickly upon this, the patriotic awakening of\r\nGermany, which led all the pupils in the highest class of the school,\r\nHeine among them, to attempt (most of them in vain) to enlist as\r\nvolunteers in the War of Liberation--all these outward conditions and\r\npsychological experiences formed and set their imprint on the boy's\r\nmind. The great humorists, such as Cervantes and Swift, were his chosen\r\nreading; _Don Quixote_ and _Gulliver's Travels_ his favourite books.\r\n\r\nIn his sixteenth year he had a first romantic attachment to a girl\r\nof his own age, Josepha by name, the daughter of an executioner, who\r\nlived with her aunt, the widow of another executioner, a woman avoided\r\nand feared by all. Heine has told us that the young girl was strangely\r\npale, that her movements were rhythmic and dignified, that she had\r\nfinely cut features, large, dark eyes, and blood-red hair. She knew and\r\ntaught him many ballads, was, he himself tells us, the first to awaken\r\nhis taste for popular poetry, and altogether, what with her radiant\r\nbeauty and the atmosphere of weirdness and horror that surrounded her,\r\nexercised no small influence on the budding poet. In Heine's first\r\npoems we observe a tendency towards thoughts of death and the grave,\r\nwhich seems to have been one result of the tender attachment of the two\r\nchildren. In No. 6 of the _Dream Pictures_, the eternal damnation which\r\nis the price that must be paid for the possession of the beautiful\r\nwoman who appears in the dream, seems to symbolise the dishonour which\r\nclung to the executioner's whole race, and acted like a curse on all\r\nwho dared to connect themselves with it.\r\n\r\nAfter 1816, Josepha's image is supplanted in Heine's soul by that of\r\nanother young girl. His parents, on whom the brilliant career of the\r\nRothschilds had made a great impression, destined their Harry (as he\r\nwas originally called) to be a merchant. They sent him first to a\r\ncommercial school in Düsseldorf, then for a few months to a banker in\r\nFrankfort, and finally placed him in an office in Hamburg, where his\r\nuncle, the well-known Salomon Heine, had risen to be a great man in\r\nthe commercial world. In 1818, with the help of this rich uncle, on\r\nwhom he remained practically dependent for the rest of his life, Heine\r\nbegan business for himself, as a commission agent for English drapery\r\ngoods. Few were surprised when, in the following spring, the firm of\r\n\"Harry Heine & Co.\" stopped payment. But in his uncle's house Heine had\r\nfound not only the crusty benefactor who, generous to his nephew as he\r\nwas, never understood him and was always irritated by him, but also, in\r\nthat benefactor's third daughter Amalie, the woman who was to be the\r\nfate of his youth, and whom he has extolled and execrated under various\r\nnames--Maria, Zuleima, in correspondence Molly. He is never tired of\r\ncelebrating her charms; she shines in beauty resplendent as that of\r\nthe goddess who emerged from the sea foam; her eyes, lips, and cheeks\r\nare those of the Madonna in the Cathedral of Cologne; her eyes are\r\nviolets, her hands lilies, &c, &c. But it does not appear that she ever\r\nloved him. He hoped in time to win her affections, and it is possible\r\nthat he may now and again have received tokens of her favour; from his\r\npoems we are led to understand that her marriage to a landed proprietor\r\nfrom Königsberg, in the year 1821, stunned him at the time, and was\r\nafterwards regarded by him as unpardonable treachery.\r\n\r\nHeine had shown how little fitted he was for the career of a merchant,\r\nand had moreover acquired a thorough distaste for it; fresh help from\r\nhis uncle now enabled him to prepare himself for one of the learned\r\nprofessions. In 1819, soon after the Jewish Reform secession, he left\r\nHamburg, and travelled by Düsseldorf to Bonn, there to study law and\r\nwork for the degree which his uncle required that he should take.\r\n\r\nThe University of Bonn, which was closed for several years during the\r\nFrench rule, had lately been reopened, and had a staff of excellent\r\nprofessors. But it was just at this time that, in consequence of the\r\nResolutions of Karlsbad, the prosecution of the students' unions\r\n(Burschenschaften) and of all national movements among the students\r\nbegan; and almost immediately after his arrival at the university,\r\nHeine, having taken part in a fête on the anniversary of the battle of\r\nLeipzig, was summoned before a magistrate and involved in a petty and\r\nfutile political law-suit, which could not fail to arouse in him a keen\r\npersonal detestation of the new reaction. The certificate he received\r\nat the matriculation examination in 1819 was to the effect that he knew\r\nno Greek, had only a slight and unpractical knowledge of Latin, and was\r\nnot qualified to enter for examination in mathematics at all; but that\r\nhe was \"not entirely wanting in knowledge of history\" and that \"his\r\nGerman work, though strange in style, showed praiseworthy effort.\"\r\n\r\nThe young student, in the velvet coat and frilled shirt, with lace\r\nfalling over his white, beautifully shaped hands, aimed at careless\r\nelegance in dress and deportment. He was of middle height; his\r\nlight-brown hair, which he wore rather long, framed a beardless,\r\nregular-featured face. The nose was almost Grecian, the eyes were blue,\r\nthe mouth was large and expressive, and the lips were often parted in\r\nthat cold, scornful smile so frequently referred to in his poems.\r\n\r\nHe attended lectures on the history of the German language, on the\r\n_Germania_ of Tacitus, on the _Niebelungenlied,_ and other historical\r\nand literary subjects; dividing his time between these and the law\r\ncourse, lectures on Roman law, German law, &c. A professor who had an\r\nundoubted influence upon the young poet was A. W. Schlegel, the leader\r\nof the Romantic school. To him Heine showed his verses. _Almansor_ was\r\nwritten about this time.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1820 Heine left Bonn for Göttingen, with the good\r\nintention of applying himself diligently to the study of law at the\r\nuniversity there. But, as he tells us very plainly in the _Harzreise_,\r\nthe place was distasteful to him, and in the course of a few months,\r\nmoreover, on account of some trifling quarrel with another student,\r\nhe was rusticated. This led to his going to Berlin in 1821. There,\r\nin Varnhagen's house, the intellectual centre of the day, where\r\nRahel gathered around her the aristocracy of culture, talent, and\r\nbirth, he soon made acquaintance with the élite of the best society\r\nof the capital. At night, in Lutter and Wegener's restaurant in the\r\nBehrenstrasse (still in existence), he met the leading lights and\r\ngenial Bohemians of the day, among them men like E. T. W. Hoffmann and\r\nGrabbe. And here, after several fruitless attempts, he succeeded in\r\nfinding a publisher, who was willing to take the risk of bringing out\r\nhis first collection of poems and to give him forty copies of the book\r\nby way of payment. It appeared in December, 1821, made his name known,\r\nalmost famous, and at once called forth both imitations and parodies.\r\n\r\nAt the university Heine attended the lectures of the first scholars\r\nof the day--Hegel, to whom he was ardently devoted; Bopp, the great\r\nauthority on Sanscrit; Wolf, the classical philologist; and Eduard\r\nGans, the great lawyer. He entered with youthful zeal into the schemes\r\nof a circle of men whose object it was to bring about a reform of\r\nJudaism, and who were attempting to initiate the Jews into the ideas\r\nof European culture. With an equal amount of youthful bitterness, he\r\nattacked in _Almansor_, in foreign garb, the renegade Jews who deserted\r\nthe common cause; and also, though indirectly, Christianity, which\r\nhe regarded as a hostile power. _Almansor_ was published, along with\r\nHeine's other youthful work, _William Ratcliff_, in 1823; it was acted,\r\nbut had no success, because of the race hatred felt for its author.[1]\r\n\r\nThe life Heine led in Berlin was not compatible with any proper\r\nprogress in his studies. It was but a continuation of the dissipated\r\nlife to which he had accustomed himself in Hamburg. In 1823 he\r\ndetermined to turn over a new leaf, and consequently left Berlin, went\r\nfirst to his parents at Lüneburg, thence to Hamburg, and from Hamburg\r\nreturned to Göttingen, where in 1825 he took his degree of Doctor of\r\nLaw. Immediately after this he was baptized. He did not change his\r\nreligion from conviction of the truth of Christianity; on the contrary,\r\nhis antipathy to it was strong, and he was thoroughly ashamed of the\r\nstep which he took simply with the aim of extricating himself from the\r\nhumiliating and galling position of dependence on his uncle; income,\r\noffice, or profession being attainable on no other condition. His frame\r\nof mind at this time is depicted in that overrated fragment, _Der Rabbi\r\nvon Bacharach_, which, in spite of some spirited and artistic passages,\r\nreally proves that Heine was incapable of writing a historical novel.\r\nAt the end of this work, the author, in the disguise of a fictitious\r\ncharacter, confesses the shame he felt at going over to a religion\r\nwhich to him was the enemy's camp.\r\n\r\nIn the correspondence between Varnhagen and Rahel, we find occasional\r\nallusions to Heine, which give us a good idea of him as he was in those\r\ndays. Curiously enough, the first time Varnhagen mentions \"our little\r\nHeine,\" he quotes an exhortation of Rahel's to the young man, which is\r\nvery remarkable, because it shows with what acute perception she had\r\nat once discovered the very author with whom he had, indeed, something\r\nin common, but whom it would have been fatal to him, both personally\r\nand in a literary sense, to resemble. The exhortation is: \"You must not\r\nbecome a Brentano. I cannot stand that!\" At another time she writes\r\njestingly: \"Heine must and shall be real, even if he has to be thrashed\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\n'Be real, O man!'\"\r\n\r\nAnd Varnhagen, too, understood him well. How acute is the following\r\nremark in a letter to Rahel, written six years later: \"And now, in\r\naddition to all the other wise and clever people who entertain you, you\r\nhave Heine with you, the original, the far-travelled, the fresh Heine!\r\nFresh in this case does not necessarily mean fresh from the sea; for\r\nsalt herring, too, and that because they _are_ salted, may be called\r\nfresh.\" The same idea recurs in an observation he makes on Heine at the\r\nage of thirty: \"I hope you will see him often, and that he will try to\r\nbenefit by his intercourse with you. He requires to be preserved in a\r\ngood spiritual atmosphere, for there is something about him that spoils\r\neasily.\"[2]\r\n\r\nRahel and Varnhagen were the first to proclaim Heine's talent. The\r\nearliest laudatory notice of his poems was written by his fashionable\r\ndiplomatic patron. Yet it is plain that they detected and deplored the\r\nweaknesses in his character, which might become dangerous, even fatal,\r\nto his great poetic gifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] G. Karpeles: _Biographie Heinrich Heine's_, 1885.\r\n\r\n[2] _Briefwechsel zwischen Varnhagen und Rahel_, vi. 48, 56, 316, 344.\r\nOther interesting utterances of Rand's on the subject of Heine are as\r\nfollows: \"I hardly see Heine; he is entirely taken up with himself,\r\nsays he must work hard, is almost surprised that such a real thing as\r\nhis father's death, his mother's grief, should affect him.... He looks\r\nhealthier, hardly complains now at all; but slight grimaces that used\r\nto be only occasional with him, have grown to be habitual, and are not\r\nbecoming; for instance a twitching of the mouth in speaking, which I\r\nused to think rather fascinating, though it was no good sign.\" \"I was\r\nintending to write about Heine. The conclusion I have come to is, that\r\nhis talent is very great, but that unless it matures, it will lose all\r\nsubstance, will degenerate into hollow mannerism.\" Varnhagen answers:\r\n\"The one hope for Heine is that he should gain the foothold of truth;\r\nonce firmly established on that, he may let his talent sally forth to\r\nseek prey and disport itself where it will\" (vi. 347, 356, 365).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHEINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most popular of Heine's books in our day, that with which his name\r\nis most inseparably connected, the _Buch der Lieder_ of 1827, consists\r\nof groups of poems belonging to different years and periods.\r\n\r\nThe first group, _Junge Leiden_ (1817-1821), is, as such, the weakest.\r\nIt is divided into four parts: Dream Pictures, Songs, Romances,\r\nSonnets. The subjects treated are: early recollections of Düsseldorf\r\nand of a happy childhood there, his love to his mother, Napoleon\r\nworship, much Catholic Rhineland romance, churchyard dances of death\r\nwith rattle of bones, and all sorts of visions. We have the jesting\r\ntone--jocose complaints of the embarrassments resulting from the\r\nall too speedy disappearance of the ducats; and the bitter tone,\r\nproduced by the poet's resentment of the humiliations to which he, as\r\nan unsuccessful and defaulting young merchant, was subjected by the\r\nwealthy citizens of Hamburg. We have outbursts of affection for college\r\nfriends, and of admiration for A. W. Schlegel, a man as distinguished\r\nin the literary world as at the university; and also patriotic\r\noutbursts in the \"Burschen\" style, which Heine quickly tired of. We\r\nhave passionate expression of the self-consciousness of genius, and we\r\nhave love-griefs and plaints of various sorts--first love's aspirations\r\n(blended in E. T. W. Hoffmann's manner with churchyard horrors),\r\nand then exceedingly sentimental laments over unreturned love, and\r\noutbursts of wild, despairing accusation of the false one, who has\r\ngiven him his deathblow, and who drinks his blood and eats his heart\r\nat her wedding feast. In one single poem, _Die Fensterschau_, the mood\r\nsuddenly changes into a sort of coarse jollity.\r\n\r\nOf these youthful poems, which for the most part are old-fashioned\r\nin form, the best are the famous epigrammatic quatrain beginning:\r\n\"Anfangs wollt' ich fast verzagen\" (I at first was near despairing),\r\nthe earliest example of the condensation of Heine's style; a few of\r\nthe sonnets, which are much more passionate than the great majority of\r\nGerman sonnets; and lastly, among the romances, _Belsazer_, probably\r\ninspired by Byron's _Hebrew Melodies_, and the inimitable ballad of the\r\n_Two Grenadiers_, already referred to.\r\n\r\nThe second group, which owes its odd title, _Lyric Intermezzo_, to the\r\nfact that it first appeared as a lyric interlude between the two bad\r\ntragedies, _Almansor_ and _Ratcliff_, published in 1823, treats of the\r\nsame subjects as the first, but in more uncommon forms and with freer\r\nartistic manipulation. Two critics, Ernst Elster and Wilhelm Bölsche\r\n(the former in the introduction to his edition of the original text of\r\nthe _Buch der Lieder_, the latter in an independent work on Heine),\r\nhave pointed out with much critical acumen that in this division we\r\nseldom have a direct expression of the poet's love troubles, but\r\nrather a sort of extract of them, which he gives us from memory. His\r\nimagination runs riot among the old sufferings, now and again actually\r\nplaying with them; hence we have an occasional unlucky expression;\r\nthe reader at times doubts the reality of the feeling, and becomes\r\nsuspicious of the constant assurances of a killing grief, in despite of\r\nwhich life goes on and art is not neglected.\r\n\r\nBut it was only natural that Heine should fall back upon this one\r\npassion, even though it had received no new nourishment in the\r\ninterval. He had felt none since which could compare with it in\r\nstrength or in influence upon his inner life. It was, and it remained,\r\nthe most important incident in his life. It seems as if any happiness\r\nit brought him had been most transient; hence the first time he sang\r\nof his love he dwelt exclusively on its woes, on the absence of all\r\nreturn, on his forsakenness, on the treachery and cold cruelty of the\r\nbeloved. Now that he was so far disenthralled, he related the whole\r\nreal or imaginary history of the passion, from the day when it first\r\nawoke to life to the hour when he was as dead for her; and imparted\r\ngreater piquancy and fulness to its life story by giving each of its\r\nseparate moments some background drawn from nature in one or other of\r\nher many moods. In the _Dream Pictures_ night reigned supreme. Now\r\nwe have the budding of the leaf, the singing of the birds, and the\r\nstarlight of May.\r\n\r\nThat the love supposed to be at first felt by the beloved one for the\r\npoet is only a fiction, and does not really agree with the facts of\r\nthe case, Heine involuntarily discloses when he paints tender scenes\r\nbetween them. For in these the lover never feels himself to be the\r\npossessor; even when he holds the object of his desire in his arms his\r\nonly feeling is longing:\r\n\r\n   \"Lehn deine Wang' an meine Wang',\r\n     Dann fliessen die Thränen zusammen!\r\n    Und an mein Herz drück fest dein Herz,\r\n     Dann schlagen zusammen die Flammen!\r\n\r\n    Und wenn in die grosse Flamme fliesst\r\n     Der Strom von unseren Thränen,\r\n    Und wenn dich mein Arm gewaltig umschliesst--\r\n     _Sterb' ich vor Liebessehnen._\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\n    Thy cheek incline, dear love to mine,\r\n     Then our tears in one stream will meet, love!\r\n    Let thy heart be pressed till on mine it rest,\r\n     Then the flames together will beat, love!\r\n\r\n    And when the stream of our tears shall light\r\n     On that flame so fiercely burning,\r\n    And within my arms I clasp thee tight--\r\n     I shall die with love's wild yearning.\r\n           (Translated by SIR THEODORE MARTIN.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis favoured lover, who, when the flames meet, dies of longing,\r\nbetrays himself to be in reality a thoroughly unsatisfied lover.\r\n\r\nHence the best of the purely erotic poems are those which express\r\nlove's longing and those which depict its sad decay. Conspicuous\r\namongst the poems of tender longing is the charming Oriental song,\r\n_Auf Flügeln des Gesanges, Herzliebchen, trag' ich dich fort_, which\r\nfascinates by its exotic Indian landscape and by its delicate fervency\r\nof feeling. Heine longed for India as Goethe longed for Italy; his\r\nspiritual home was on the banks of the Ganges, as Goethe's was on the\r\nbanks of the Tiber. It is probable that Bopp's lectures first turned\r\nhis thoughts in the direction of that Oriental dream-land; but in\r\npicturing it he employs the purely imaginative, Romantic style, which\r\nhe inherited, remodelled for himself, and used in painting the far-off\r\nand alluring.\r\n\r\nHow simply beautiful is such a verse as:\r\n\r\n   \"Dort wollen wir niedersinken\r\n     Unter dem Palmenbaum,\r\n    Und Lieb' und Ruhe trinken\r\n     Und träumen seligen Traum.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[2]\r\n\r\n   We'll lie there, in slumber sinking,\r\n    'Neath the palm tree by the stream,\r\n   Raptures and rest deep drinking,\r\n    Dreaming the happiest dream.\r\n                       (C. G. LELAND.)\r\n\r\nBut a verse like:\r\n\r\n   \"Dort liegt ein rothblühender Garten\r\n     Im stillen Mondenschein,\r\n    Die Lotosblumen erwarten\r\n     Ihr trautes Schwesterlein.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[3]\r\n\r\n   There a red-blooming garden is lying\r\n    In the moonlight silent and clear;\r\n   The lotus flowers are sighing\r\n    For their sister so gentle and dear.\r\n                        (E. A. BOWRING.)\r\n\r\nbeautiful as it is, caressing as it sounds, has something of the\r\nunnaturalness which often strikes the reader in Heine's painting of\r\nnature. The colouring is vivid, but not real; local colours obtrude\r\nthemselves to the detriment of the general tone. \"Rothblühender,\"\r\n(red-blooming) is hardly the word that it would naturally occur\r\nto one to use in describing a garden seen by moonlight. In the\r\nlines: \"Gegenüber am Fenster sassen _Rosengesichter_ dämmernd und\r\n_mond_beglänzt.\" (At the opposite window glimmered rose-faces,\r\nbright in the moonlight glow), from the later poem _Abenddämmerung_\r\n(\"Twilight\"), we have the same sort of effect, produced at the same\r\nexpense of naturalness. The declaration that the lotus flowers are\r\nexpecting their dear sister sounds like an old-fashioned compliment\r\nin the midst of this gorgeous Ganges imagery. We have much the same\r\nexpression in the stanza:\r\n\r\n   \"Es flüstern und sprechen die Blumen\r\n      Und schau'n mitleidig mich an:\r\n    Sei unsrer Schwester nicht böse,\r\n      Du trauriger, blasser Mann!\"[4]\r\n\r\n[4]\r\n\r\n   The flowers are whispering and talking;\r\n     With pity my features they scan:\r\n   O, pray do not chide our sister,\r\n     Thou sorrowful, pale-faced man!\r\n                          (C. G. LELAND.)\r\n\r\nThis is a madrigal style which Heine leaves behind in his later work.\r\n\r\nAnother of the verses in this wonderfully emotional song of the Ganges\r\nhas characteristics which point to Heine's derivation from the Romantic\r\nschool, with its arbitrary interpretation of nature:--\r\n\r\n   \"Die Veilchen kichern und kosen\r\n    Und schau'n nach den Sternen empor.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[5]\r\n\r\n   The violets titter, caressing,\r\n   Peeping up as the planets appear.\r\n                     (C. G. LELAND.)\r\n\r\nIt is quite audacious enough to represent violets as caressing each\r\nother; we are reminded of Hans Andersen's enchanted gardens; to make\r\nthem titter is certainly too much of a good thing. Émile Zola affects\r\nthis same style in his description of the Paradou garden.\r\n\r\nThe next song, which is conceived in the same spirit, the song of\r\nthe lotus flower that fears the splendour of the sun, is a charming\r\npoem, despite its flower-innocence, marvellously, meltingly sensuous.\r\nSensual-spiritual desire is here intensified till it reaches the verge\r\nof hysteria; for the poet, not content with making the lotus flower\r\nblossom and glow and shine and exhale fragrance and tremble, when her\r\nlover, the moon, awakes her with his rays, actually makes her weep.[6]\r\n\r\n[6] _Cf_ W. Kirchbach: _Heine's Dichterwerkstatt_, in _Magazin für die\r\nLitteratur_, Jahrgang 57, Nr. 18, 19, 20.\r\n\r\nNext in real feeling to the poems of desire come those that express the\r\nrelinquishment, the cessation of the passion. The finest example is\r\npoem No. 59 in the _Intermezzo_, which in its first verse describes the\r\nfalling of a star, the star of love, from heaven; in its second, the\r\nfalling of the apple-blossoms from the tree; in its third, the sinking\r\nof a swan to its watery grave; then sums all up in the concluding\r\nverse:\r\n\r\n   \"Es ist so still und dunkel!\r\n      Verweht ist Blatt und Blüth',\r\n    Der Stern ist knisternd zerstoben,\r\n      Verklungen das Schwanenlied.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[7]\r\n\r\n   The silence and the night fall,\r\n     The blossoms all have fled,\r\n   In sparks the star has vanished,\r\n     The swan and his song are dead.\r\n                             (H. F.)\r\n\r\nIt is very characteristic of Heine that, as the poem stands, it does\r\nnot produce the impression that he has really witnessed any one of the\r\nthree natural scenes depicted; they are simply symbols, arbitrarily\r\nselected and combined.\r\n\r\nAmongst this passionate verse he has interspersed poems of a totally\r\ndifferent description, treating of far more trivial amours. Some of\r\nthe most exceptionable of these he did not include in the _Buch der\r\nLieder_, not even, for example, the very harmless:--\r\n\r\n   \"Du sollst mich liebend umschliessen,\r\n      Geliebtes, schönes Weib!\r\n    Umschling mich mit Armen und Füssen\r\n      Und mit dem geschmeidigen Leib!\"[8]\r\n\r\n[8]\r\n\r\n   Come, twine in wild rapture round me,\r\n     Fair woman, beloved and warm,\r\n   Till thy feet and hands have bound me,\r\n     And I'm wreathed with thy supple form!\r\n                                  (LELAND.)\r\n\r\nBut we have, among others, _Die Welt ist dumm, die Welt ist blind_\r\n(\"The world is stupid, the world is blind\"), with its description of\r\nburning kisses. There are also other epigrammatic verses of a serious,\r\npassionate character, such as the well-known _Ich hab' dich geliebet\r\nund liebe dich noch_ (\"I have loved thee long, and I love thee now\");\r\nand, finally, in the very famous _Ein Jüngling liebt ein Mädchen, die\r\nhat einen Andern erwählt_ (\"A young man loves a maiden, who another\r\nto him prefers\"), with intentional triviality of diction, and with an\r\nimpersonality which is unusual with him, Heine generalises the human\r\nfate which has made of him an erotic poet.\r\n\r\nTo the collection of poems which form the second part of the _Lyric\r\nIntermezzo_, the title _Heimkehr_ (\"The Home-Coming\") is given.\r\nThey were written in 1823-1824 in Hamburg and Cuxhaven, and the\r\n\"home-coming\" is the poet's return to Hamburg, the scene of his love\r\nromance, where the sight of all the familiar surroundings causes his\r\nheart's wounds to bleed afresh. With this main theme is associated\r\nanother, new in German poetry--the sea, which Heine now saw for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\nMingled with the lamentations over his lost love, which the sight of\r\nthe environments of the old tragedy calls forth, are records of new\r\nimpressions. There is first a wild outbreak of the old passion; he\r\nbroods once more over all its agonies; he is miserable in the streets,\r\nwhere he feels as if the houses were falling on him, and still more\r\nmiserable in the rooms where she plighted her faith to him. What is new\r\nin these songs of unhappy love is the hatred, always alike passionate\r\nand wild, that flames up over the grave of buried happiness.\r\n\r\nBut on his travels the poet has met the family of his beloved, and her\r\nyounger sister resembles her, especially when she laughs; she has the\r\nsame eyes, the eyes that have made him so unhappy. In a letter dated\r\nAugust 23rd, 1823, he tells his best friend that \"a new folly has been\r\nengrafted on the old.\" Ernst Elster's careful study of letters and\r\npoems has enabled him to show that about this time Heine's first and\r\nvery unfortunate passionate attachment to Amalie Heine was superseded\r\nby a passion for Therese Heine, who was her sister's junior by eight\r\nyears. Eveline and Ottilie are the poetic names bestowed on Therese.\r\nThe new passion was a violent one, but in all probability met with as\r\nlittle return as the first. Hence the well-known lines:\r\n\r\n   \"Wer zum ersten Male liebt,\r\n    Sei's auch glücklos, ist ein Gott;\r\n    Aber wer zum zweiten Male\r\n    Glücklos liebt, der ist ein Narr.\r\n\r\n    Ich, ein solcher Narr, ich liebe\r\n    Wieder ohne Gegenliebe;\r\n    Sonne, Mond und Sterne lachen,\r\n    Und ich lache mit--und sterbe.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[9]\r\n\r\n    He who for the first time loves,\r\n    Though unloved, is still a god;\r\n    But the man who loves a second\r\n    And in vain, must be a fool.\r\n\r\n    Such a fool am I, now loving\r\n    Once again, without return;\r\n    Sun and moon and stars are smiling,\r\n    And I smile with them--and perish.\r\n                             (LELAND.)\r\n\r\nIn the year 1828 Therese Heine was engaged and married to a Dr. Adolf\r\nHalle. Among Heine's posthumous poems are bitterly satirical verses on\r\nthe bridegroom and the wedding. He had the unchivalrous poet's habit of\r\nrevenging himself by satire when he met with a rebuff. But the poems in\r\n_Heimkehr_ which refer to Therese are not inspired with the bitterness\r\nand hatred which Heine frequently displays in writing of her elder\r\nsister. He praises Therese's beauty, her lovely eyes, her purity; she\r\nis like a flower; he prays to her as others pray to Paul and Peter and\r\nthe Madonna; and he struggles against his feelings, dreads this new\r\npassion. Both pride and shyness forbid him to declare it; it would be\r\nbetter for her if she did not love him; at times he has himself tried\r\nto prevent the awakening of love in her soul; but, having been only too\r\nsuccessful in the attempt, the desire for her love once more asserts\r\nitself. He is too proud to speak of his passion and of his suffering,\r\nmockery and jests are on his lips, while inwardly he is bleeding to\r\ndeath; but she does not understand him, does not see that his heart is\r\ntrembling, is breaking. Hence these lines:\r\n\r\n   \"O, dieser Mund ist viel zu stolz\r\n      Und kann nur küssen und scherzen;\r\n    Er spräche vielleicht ein höhnisches Wort,\r\n      Während ich sterbe vor Schmerzen.\"[10]\r\n\r\n[10]\r\n\r\n   Alas, this mouth is far too proud,\r\n     'Twas made but for kissing and sighing;\r\n   Perchance it may speak a scornful word,\r\n     While I with sorrow am dying.\r\n                                  (BOWRING.)\r\n\r\nBut this time the threat of dying is not intended to be taken\r\nliterally. For in another poem we find the sincere assurance:--\r\n\r\n   \"Glaub' nicht, dass ich mich erschiesse,\r\n      Wie schlimm auch die Sachen steh'n!\r\n    Das Alles, meine Süsse,\r\n      Ist mir schon einmal gescheh'n.\"[11]\r\n\r\n[11]\r\n\r\n    Fear not that I shall languish,\r\n      Or shoot myself: oh, no!\r\n    I've gone through all this anguish\r\n      Already, long ago.\r\n                             (LELAND.)\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, however, he felt deeply and suffered greatly this time\r\nalso. Strange as it sounds, cousin-love, which is, as a rule, merely\r\nthe initiation into the life of passion, its first preliminary stage,[12]\r\n(Note 20) was the only serious, and not perfectly transient passion\r\nknown to young Heine. And no feeling experienced later, in his mature\r\nmanhood, approached in intensity to this youthful twin-passion for two\r\nsisters, the second of whom reminded him of the first.\r\n\r\n[12]\r\n\r\n    Aux prés de l'enfance on cueille\r\n    Les petites amourettes\r\n    Qu'on jette au vent feuille à feuille,\r\n    Ainsi que des pâquerettes;\r\n    On cueille dans ces prairies\r\n    Les voisines, les cousines,\r\n    Les amourettes fleuries\r\n    Et qui n'ont pas de racines.\r\n                              (RICHEPIN.)\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional poems which refer to this episode in his psychic\r\nhistory, Heine introduced (exactly as he did in the _Intermezzo_)\r\nverses relating to less serious love affairs, to college adventures,\r\nand even to quite low, venal, erotic pleasures. He omitted from the\r\n_Buch der Lieder_ some of the most objectionable of these, which\r\noriginally formed part of the _Heimkehr_, amongst others the amusing,\r\nthough impudent:\r\n\r\n   \"Blamier mich nicht, mein schönes Kind,\r\n      Und grüss mich nicht unter den Linden;\r\n    Wenn wir nachher zu Hause sind,\r\n      Wird sich schon Alles finden.\"[13]\r\n\r\n[13]\r\n\r\n   Don't compromise me, my pretty one,\r\n     Don't bow to me in \"Rotten Row\";\r\n   At home together afterwards\r\n     I'll make up for it, that you know.\r\n\r\n--and even such a merry wanton rhyme as:--\r\n\r\n   \"Himmlisch war's, wenn ich bezwang\r\n      Meine sündige Begier;\r\n    Aber wenn's mir nicht gelang,\r\n      Hatt' ich doch ein gross Plaisir.\"[14]\r\n\r\n[14]\r\n\r\n   'Twas heavenly joy to overcome\r\n      Each sinful wish and thought;\r\n    But when I couldn't, truth to tell,\r\n      That, too, much pleasure brought.\r\n\r\nWhat we are most struck by in the poems of this division is the\r\nauthor's double gift of song and painting. Along with the capacity\r\nfor producing those outbursts of mixed passion, which sound like the\r\nunaffected heart-cry of modern humanity, he here reveals a special\r\ntalent for painting, for producing figures by means of light and shade\r\nand colour, without outline.\r\n\r\nThere is the scene in the lonely parsonage, with the disunited,\r\ndespairing family (_Der bleiche, herbstliche Halbmond_). The son is\r\ndetermined to be a highway robber, the daughter has made up her mind to\r\nsell herself to the Count. With all its vividness, however, this scene\r\nis not one of the best. There is too much old-fashioned Romanticism\r\nin the idea of the dead father in his black robes standing outside,\r\nknocking at the window. The next poem, _Das ist ein schlechtes Wetter_,\r\nis a most masterly production. We see the little old woman hobbling\r\nacross the street with her lantern late on the dark and stormy evening,\r\nto make purchases for her tall, beautiful daughter, who is lying in the\r\narm-chair at home, blinking sleepily at the light, her golden locks\r\nfalling over her sweet face--it is like an old Dutch painting.\r\n\r\nStill finer is the group of eight poems which was the result of his\r\nstay at Cuxhaven. _Wir sassen am Fischerhause_ is a little marvel\r\nof artistic ability--that talk with the girls, sitting outside the\r\nfisherman's hut, in which far-off India and Ultima Thule are described\r\nin a few words: \"By the Ganges all is brightness and fragrance, giant\r\ntrees blossom, and beautiful, tranquil men and women kneel to the lotus\r\nflowers. In Lapland the people are dirty and small; their heads are\r\nflat and their mouths are wide; they cower round the fire, roast fish,\r\nand screech and scream.\"\r\n\r\nThen there are merry poems, treating of light characters like the girl\r\nwhom he searches for through the whole town and finds in a fashionable\r\nhotel, and the girl in whose heart the blue hussars are quartered.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, there are single epigrammatic verses, which every one\r\nnow knows by heart, but which, at the time they appeared, gave great\r\noffence and made enemies for their author. Especially noteworthy is the\r\nfamous:\r\n\r\n   \"Selten habt ihr mich verstanden,\r\n      Selten auch verstand ich euch,\r\n    Nur wenn wir im Koth uns fanden,\r\n      So verstanden wir uns gleich.\"[15]\r\n\r\n[15]\r\n\r\n   Little by thee comprehended,\r\n     Little knew I thee, good brother;\r\n   When we in the mud descended\r\n     Soon we understood each other.\r\n                             (LELAND.)\r\n\r\nIt is incomprehensible that this verse should ever have been regarded\r\nas a confession of unclean instincts. It only applies to those who find\r\ntheir way straight to any exceptionable or indecent passage in a book,\r\nas the sow finds her way to the mire, and stops there. That it never\r\noccurred to Heine that he was making any admission of having desired to\r\nappeal to his reader's sensual instincts or cynic tendencies is best\r\nproved by the poem which immediately follows on the lines in question,\r\nthe one beginning:\r\n\r\n   \"Doch die Kastraten klagten,\r\n      Als ich meine Stimm' erhob;\r\n    Sie klagten und sie sagten:\r\n      Ich sänge viel zu grob.\"[16]\r\n\r\n[16]\r\n\r\n   How the eunuchs were complaining\r\n     At the roughness of my song!\r\n   Complaining and explaining\r\n     That my voice was much too strong.\r\n                              (LELAND.)\r\n\r\nHe could not have declared more unmistakably that, where he is\r\nstraightforward, plain-spoken, or cynical, it is only the result of his\r\nmodern tendency to realistic truthfulness, of his antipathy to romantic\r\nembellishment, and of his instinctive inclination to face the bitter\r\ntruth of life.\r\n\r\nAnd there is quite as little justification for the general complaint\r\nof what Julian Schmidt has called the low-mindedness of Heine's sudden\r\nleaps from the sublime to the sordid. We have a typical instance of\r\nthese sudden changes of style and mood in the poem _Frieden_ (\"Peace\"),\r\none of the group of North Sea poems, in which Heine, during a calm at\r\nsea, beholds the giant form of Jesus, the Prince of Peace, striding\r\nover sea and land. He is clothed in white; his head touches the clouds;\r\nthe heart in his breast is the sun, the red, flaming sun, and this\r\nsun-heart sheds its illuminating, warming rays over land and sea. Then\r\nthere is a sudden revulsion of mood. Heine calls to mind a miserable,\r\ncanting fellow in Berlin, weak in mind and body, strong in faith--what\r\nwould not _he_ give to be able to hit upon such pious imagery, by means\r\nof which he might ingratiate himself with those in power and perhaps\r\nattain to the position of court-councillor in the pious town on the\r\nSpree--what dreams he would have of a hundred thalers rise in salary!\r\n\r\nHeine most undoubtedly spoiled the effect of his beautiful vision.\r\nHe broke up his poem, shattered its melody with grotesque discords;\r\nbut yet it is easy to understand that in the case of a poet with\r\nhis experience of modern life, the second vision was a perfectly\r\nnatural sequel to the first; and in any case it is unjustifiable to\r\nspeak of this connection of ideas, this \"idea-leap,\" as a symptom of\r\nlow-mindedness. In this connection Wilhelm Bölsche makes the true and\r\npertinent observation that no one has accused Goethe of low-mindedness\r\nbecause he allows the gibes of Mephistopheles to follow directly upon\r\nFaust's confession of faith to Gretchen (_Heinrich Heine_, p. 106). And\r\nyet the only difference is that in _Faust_ the pathos and the ribaldry\r\nare put into the mouths of two people, whereas in the lyric poem the\r\npoet makes himself directly responsible for both.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the end of this collection (_Heimkehr_), we come upon a\r\ncouple of poems which are distinguished by depth of feeling and\r\nperfection of form. The particular arrangement of their rhymes would\r\ndistinguish them from the majority of the small poems, if nothing else\r\ndid, as it is one we seldom meet with in Heine. The first, _Dämmernd\r\nliegt der Sommerabend_ (\"Summer eve with day is striving\"), which\r\ndescribes the beautiful elf-maiden bathing in the river by moonlight,\r\nhas the diaphanous haze of a Corot landscape. The rhythmic treatment\r\nof the second gives it a unique place in the collection. It is the\r\npathetic, fantastic:\r\n\r\n   \"Der Tod, das ist die kühle Nacht,\r\n      Das Leben ist der schwüle Tag.\r\n    Es dunkelt schon, mich schläfert,\r\n      Der Tag hat mich müd gemacht.\r\n\r\n    Über mein Bett erhebt sich ein Baum,\r\n      Drin singt die junge Nachtigall;\r\n    Sie singt von lauter Liebe,\r\n      Ich hör' es sogar im Traum.\"[17]\r\n\r\n[17]\r\n\r\n    Death is a cool and pleasant night,\r\n      Life is a sultry day.\r\n    'Tis growing dark-I'm weary,\r\n      For day has tired me with his light.\r\n\r\n    Over my bed a fair tree gleams,\r\n      And in it sits a nightingale:\r\n    She sings of naught save love,\r\n      I hear it even in dreams.\r\n                              (LELAND.)\r\n\r\nThe next division of the _Buch der Lieder, Aus der Harzreise_ (1824),\r\ncontains the delightful mountain-rhymes conceived in the course of\r\na walking tour which Heine took by way of refreshment after his law\r\nstudies in Göttingen. Here we have charming pictures of mountain\r\nscenery and peasant life, and a tone of witty, bold self-laudation,\r\nkept up with irresistible audacity. The beautiful and witty poem\r\nabout the knight of the Holy Spirit was doubtless suggested by the\r\ncatechising scene in _Faust_, but has an originality of its own which\r\nhas made it popular all the world over.\r\n\r\nThe _Buch der Lieder_ closes with the North Sea poems (_Die Nordsee_,\r\n1825-1826), inspired by two visits to Norderney, and written in\r\nforcible, irregular rhythm. In them we observe first and foremost a\r\nparticular understanding of nature which is a new gain for German\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nAs far as nature was concerned, Goethe seemed to have exhausted\r\neverything. His love for every living thing, his feeling of kinship\r\nwith animals and plants, his persuasion that the human being is one\r\nwith all other beings, his intuition of the unity that underlies\r\nperpetual change of form--this gift of resolving all nature into\r\nfeeling was his earliest characteristic. It was soon superseded, or\r\nrather supplemented, by his capacity for observing and reproducing\r\nnatural scenes without any ascription of his own feelings to them. He\r\nstudies nature, becomes an observer and investigator, and finally,\r\nthanks to the steadily increasing profundity of his observation, in\r\ncombination with his genial intuition, an epoch-making discoverer in\r\ntwo great domains of natural science. We see him pass through all the\r\nphases of a great mind in its relation to nature--the emotional, the\r\nreligious-pantheistic, the poetic-scientific--and see him in the end\r\nlay such exclusive stress upon material impressions that he thrusts all\r\nthat is psychical from him as merely disturbing. His views become more\r\nand more positive and realistic. In his essay on granite he writes: \"I\r\ndo not fear the reproach of its being a spirit of contradiction that\r\nhas led me from the observation and delineation of the human heart,\r\nthat youngest, most multiform, most mobile, most changeable part of\r\ncreation, that which it is easiest to unsettle and to shake, to the\r\nobservation of nature's oldest, firmest, deepest, most immovable son\"[18]\r\n--namely, granite.\r\n\r\n[18] Goethe: _Werke_, xxxiii. 164.\r\n\r\nIn what domain was it still possible for a German poet to display\r\nfresh, original understanding of nature? From the human heart to\r\ngranite Goethe had embraced them all.\r\n\r\nThere was one left. Goethe had never sung the sea. He saw it for the\r\nfirst time when he was nearly forty, in Venice, from the Lido. \"I\r\nheard a loud noise,\" he writes; \"it was the sea, and I soon saw it,\r\nrolling high waves up the beach, as it drew back. It was midday and\r\nebb-tide. At last, then, I have seen the sea also with my own eyes.\"\r\nA little further on we come upon the short sentence: \"Yes, the sea is\r\na wonderful sight.\" In the Fifth Act of the Second Part of _Faust_,\r\nwhere the sea and navigation are touched on, it is less the sea itself\r\nthat is in question than the rescuing of land from it and the making of\r\ncanals. This was all that Goethe had written about the sea.\r\n\r\nIn Heine's North Sea poems we hear, for the first time in German\r\npoetry, the roar of the ocean, with all its freshness and in all its\r\nmight. Here for the first time we have shells in the sand beneath our\r\nfeet, and sea-gulls in the air above us. The sea is painted in storm\r\nand calm, from the shore and from the ship, by day and by night, with\r\nthe peace that at times lies over it, and with the madness of the\r\nhurricane; we have the sweet day-dreams to which it gives rise, and\r\nalso the sea-sickness; there arise from its depths and there hover\r\nover its expanse a whole company of mythic figures, old and new, old\r\nthat have been metamorphosed into new, a world of gods and goddesses,\r\nTritons and Oceanides, at times pathetic, more frequently burlesque.\r\nAnd yet there is comparatively little description; it is the poet's\r\nown memories, griefs, and hopes that fill these poems. And it is his\r\nintense longing to be able to breathe freely that breaks forth in\r\nthe famous cry with which the ten thousand Greeks, after their long\r\nand terrible march, hailed the element that spoke to them of home:\r\n\"Thalatta! Thalatta!--I salute thee, O eternal sea!\"\r\n\r\nAmongst these poems are some of Heine's most beautiful and\r\nunforgettable. First there is the humorously frivolous idyll _Die Nacht\r\nam Strande_ (\"Night by the Seashore\"); the poet's visit to the pretty\r\nfisherman's daughter, with the masterly description of her appearance,\r\nas she sits bending over the fire:\r\n\r\n   \"Dass die flackernd rothen Lichter\r\n    Zauberlieblich wiederstrahlen\r\n    Auf das glühende Antlitz,\r\n    Auf die zarte, weisse Schulter,\r\n    Die rührend hervorlauscht\r\n    Aus dem groben, grauen Hemde,\r\n    Und auf die kleine, sorgsame Hand,\r\n    Die das Unterröckchen fester bindet\r\n    Um die feine Hüfte.\"[19]\r\n\r\n[19]\r\n\r\n   Till the flashing, ruddy flame-rays\r\n   Shine again in magic lustre\r\n   On her glowing countenance,\r\n   On the soft and snow-white shoulder\r\n   Which so touchingly peers out\r\n   From its coarse grey linen covering,\r\n   And on the busy little hand\r\n   Which is fastening the garment\r\n   That conceals her slender limbs.\r\n             (Adapted from LELAND.)\r\n\r\nThen we come on a poem which is unique in its lyric vigour, _Erklärung_\r\n(\"Declaration\"), to that Agnes whose name the poet would fain write on\r\nthe dark vault of heaven with the highest fir of Norway, dipped in the\r\ncrater of Etna. And there is also the little, reflective poem _Fragen_\r\n(\"Questions\"), admirable in its pregnant brevity, which gives us an\r\nidea of the mood in which Heine conceived the foolhardy idea of writing\r\na \"Faust,\" after Goethe, a plan which he actually did not hesitate to\r\nmention to Goethe himself, when he visited him in Weimar. In some of\r\nthese North Sea poems, and that even when he is belittling and sneering\r\nat himself, there is a repellent tone of self-satisfaction. Amongst\r\nthose which are quite free from it, must be mentioned that masterly\r\npiece of pure humour, _Im Hafen_ (\"In Harbour\"), the immortal fantasy\r\nof the Town Cellar of Bremen, in which Heine, whose sobriety was almost\r\nequivalent to total abstinence, gives us a most irresistible picture of\r\na clever man's merry carouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nHEINE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for a northerner of mature years and fairly sound\r\nartistic training to study Heinrich Heine's poems without feeling his\r\ntaste offended by figures and expressions which in Heine's case early\r\nbecame lifeless mannerisms. The Romance nations do not feel this.\r\nOne actually hears competent critics of Romance nationality compare\r\nHeine's lyrics with Goethe's, and give the preference to Heine's as\r\nmore plastic and more spiritual. To Romance readers Goethe is, as a\r\nrule, wanting in transparency; the French say of Heine: _On y voit\r\nmieux_. They do not feel that in Goethe's case words always represent\r\nthings; whereas in Heine's case, expressions are often set pieces,\r\nwhich are inserted to produce a certain poetical effect, but which\r\nhave no vision, no actuality behind them. Few poets have made such\r\nabuse of lily-hands, rose-cheeks, and violet-eyes, these monstrous\r\ncolour-blotches, in describing female beauty, or of the various\r\nattributes of spring--flowers that exhale fragrance, nightingales that\r\nsing both day and night--in proclaiming the praises of the lovely month\r\nof May. The nightingale in particular becomes under his treatment a\r\npurely heraldic bird in the coat-of-arms of love.\r\n\r\nIn Goethe's case all the words are images, and this is the reason\r\nwhy he requires to employ so little imagery. In Heine's the words\r\nare constantly allegories, devoid of perspicuity and of that inward\r\nconnection which is the logic of poetry. Take as an instance: \"Aus\r\nmeinen Thränen spriessen--vie' blühende Blumen hervor,\"[1] where by\r\nflowers poems are meant; or: \"Sprüh'n einmal vert dächt'ge Funken--aus\r\nden Rosen, sorge nie--diese Welt glaubt nicht an Flammen--und sie\r\nnimmt's für Poesie,\"[2] where we are presented with a skein of\r\nimages more entangled than those of the notorious old Scandinavian\r\ntranscriptions of the decadent period in Skaldic poetry--sparks struck\r\nout of roses; sparks, which the everyday world will not accept as fire;\r\nrose sparks, which are called poetry!\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\n    Up from my tears are growing\r\n    Fair flowers in many vales.\r\n                      (LELAND)\r\n\r\n[2]\r\n\r\nIf suspicious sparks should issue\r\n  From the roses--fearless be!\r\nThis dull world in flames believes not,\r\n  But believes them poetry.\r\n                        (BOWRING)\r\n\r\nWhat one objects to most in these poems with their allegorical\r\nrhetoric is the combination of sentimentality and materialism. Sighs\r\nand tears are talked of as if sighs were very loud breaths and tears\r\nvery tangible substances. We have, for instance: \"Und meine Seufzer\r\nwerden--ein Nachtigallenchor\" (And from my sighs go flying, A choir of\r\nnightingales), still further materialised by the addition of: \"Und\r\nvor deinem Fenster soll singen--das Lied der Nachtigall\" (And the\r\nnightingales at thy window, Shall sing all the summer hours). A still\r\nmore striking instance is to be found in the typical poem of the lonely\r\ntear:--\r\n\r\n   \"Was will die einsame Thräne?\r\n      Sie trübt mir ja den Blick,\r\n    Sie blieb aus alten Zeiten\r\n      In meinem Auge zurück.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[3]\r\n\r\n    What means this lonely tear-drop\r\n      Which dims mine eye to-day?\r\n    It is the last now left me\r\n      Where once so many lay.\r\n\r\nWe are initiated into this particular tear's family history and present\r\nlonely situation; it had many bright sisters, who now are no more, so\r\nthat it is left solitary in its eyecorner. It is addressed much as one\r\nwould address any good old comrade, told to go its way, now that all\r\nthe others have gone:--\r\n\r\n   \"Du alte, einsame Thräne,\r\n      Zerfliesse jetzunder auch!\"[4]\r\n\r\n[4]\r\n\r\n   Thou tear-drop old and lonely,\r\n     Do thou, too, pass away!\r\n\r\nThe sentimentality is so crude that no parody could be more comic than\r\nthis mournful apostrophe, which the arch-scoffer wrote in all good\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nEvery defect in the artist as a man, comes out in his art. It is always\r\na want of simplicity, of genuine feeling, that produces the sentimental\r\nor ostentatious or clap-trap expression. Heine's shortcomings in this\r\nway are strongly felt when we compare certain outbursts of his with\r\nGoethe's expression of similar feelings.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the poem in which Heine describes himself as the\r\nill-fated Atlas; condemned to bear the whole world of suffering:\r\n\r\n   \"Du stolzes Herz, du hast es ja gewollt,\r\n    Du wolltest glücklich sein, unendlich glücklich,\r\n    Oder unendlich elend, stolzes Herz!\r\n    Und jetzo bist du elend.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[5]\r\n\r\n   Proud heart, 'twas thine own choice,\r\n   Thou chosest to be happy, infinitely happy,\r\n   Or infinitely miserable, proud heart!\r\n   And now thou art miserable.\r\n\r\nThese are lines one does not forget. But the exclamation of the first\r\nline, which expresses a perilous extreme of self-reliance, becomes\r\nself-complacency when Heine's stanza is placed alongside of Goethe's\r\nsimple and grand\r\n\r\n   \"Alles geben die Götter, die Unendlichen,\r\n    Ihren Lieblingen ganz:\r\n    Alle Freuden, die unendlichen,\r\n    Alle Schmerzen, die unendlichen,\r\n    Ganz.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[6] What the eternal Gods, give to their favourites, they give without\r\nalloy-infinite joy, infinite sorrow--without alloy.\r\n\r\nIt would be most unreasonable to blame Heine because he employs other\r\nand more violent methods than Goethe does--to say, for instance, of\r\na poem like _Ein Jüngling liebt ein Mädchen_ (\"A young man loves a\r\nmaiden\"), that Goethe would have shrunk from the grotesqueness of the\r\nbitter, desperate ending: \"Und wem sie just passieret, Dem bricht das\r\nHerz entzwei\" (And he to whom it happens, It breaks his heart in two).\r\nIt would have been abhorrent to him for much the same reason that it\r\nwould have been abhorrent to an old Greek. What is simply new, simply\r\n_modern_ in the feeling, is justifiable. Even the grotesqueness is in\r\nthis case artistically led up to.\r\n\r\nBut at times the grotesque grimace is all that is left of the modern\r\nelement. Take that famous poem: _Mein Herz, mein Herz ist traurig_\r\n(\"My heart, my heart is heavy\"). It contains an admirable description\r\nof a wide landscape, viewed from the height of the old bastion. We\r\nsee the blue town moat, with a boy fishing from a boat, and away on\r\nthe other side of the moat, small and clear, we see summer-houses and\r\ngardens, men and oxen, meadows and woods, girls bleaching clothes, a\r\nturning mill-wheel sending out diamond dust, and at the foot of the\r\nold grey tower a sentry-box, with the sentry walking up and down, his\r\ngun flashing in the sunlight. H. C. Andersen, writing of this poem,\r\nremarks, \"And the end is so _affecting_: 'Ich wollt', er schösse mich\r\ntodt'\" (I wish he would shoot me dead). Affecting? No. Startling;\r\nfor nothing has prepared us for it. The ejaculation is possibly not\r\nentirely insincere; but it is so nervous that it is practically\r\nmeaningless; it is in so far untruthful, that these big words only\r\nexpress a momentary mood, not a serious, determined desire.\r\n\r\nGoethe has expressed, if not longing for death, at least reconciliation\r\nto the idea of death, in the famous, immortal lines:\r\n\r\n   \"Ueber allen Gipfeln\r\n    Ist Ruh.\r\n    In allen Wipfeln\r\n    Spürest du\r\n    Kaum einen Hauch.\r\n    Die Vögelein schweigen im Walde.\r\n    Warte nur, balde\r\n    Ruhest du auch.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[7]\r\n\r\n   O'er all the hill tops\r\n   Is quiet now,\r\n   In all the tree tops\r\n   Hearest thou\r\n   Hardly a breath;\r\n   The birds are asleep in the trees.\r\n   Wait; soon like these\r\n   Thou too shalt rest.\r\n                   (LONGFELLOW)\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to direct attention to the contrast between the two\r\npoet-natures which is revealed by a comparison of this melody in words\r\nwith Heine's discord; but note, from the purely artistic point of view,\r\nhow marvellously in keeping all the different parts of the little poem\r\nare. It is one breath from the first word to the last: The calm of\r\nevening over the forest and in the human soul, the cessation of all\r\ndesire, the resolution of all discords, the heart, great and tender,\r\nfeeling itself one with all nature.\r\n\r\nAlongside of this perfection, the defects of Heine's lyric\r\neffect-style, in its occasional inartistic application, show up only\r\ntoo glaringly. It is akin, in its weaknesses, to the allegorising,\r\nfantastic style of the German Romanticists, from whom Heine, the poet,\r\nis lineally descended. And yet he is as far from being a genuine\r\nRomanticist as he is from being what some consider him, a genuine\r\nmodern realist.\r\n\r\nHe calls his _Atta Troll_ the last free forest ditty of Romance. Others\r\nhave, in unfriendly criticism, called his poetry the decomposition\r\nprocess of Romance. \"I wrote _Atta Troll_\" he says, \"for my own\r\namusement, in the whimsical dream-style that prevailed in that Romantic\r\nschool in which I passed the pleasantest years of my youth, and ended\r\nup by thrashing the schoolmaster.\" But in this case the Romanticism is\r\nreally only the rich, glittering garment, in which the modern spirit\r\nmasques, and which it finally throws off. None of the elements of\r\nRomance are wanting--animals talk, bears exchange ideas, we listen to\r\na pug-dog's confidences, and we are conducted into a legendary region,\r\nthe valley of Roncesvalles. Not even the blue flower is wanting:\r\n\r\n   \"Ronceval, du edles Thal,\r\n    Wenn ich deinen Namen höre,\r\n    Bebt und duftet mir im Herzen\r\n    Die verscholl'ne blaue Blume.\"[8]\r\n\r\n[8]\r\n\r\n    Ronceval, thou noble valley!\r\n    Whensoe 'er I hear thy name,\r\n    That blue flower so long departed\r\n    O'er my spirit sheds its fragrance.\r\n                             (BOWRING)\r\n\r\nThe dream-world reveals itself to us; great spirit eyes look into ours.\r\nThe poet, with his guide, goes hunting in the Pyrenees. This guide has\r\nan old mother, who is reputed to be a witch. We are introduced into the\r\nwitch's hovel, with the stuffed birds, the ghost-like vultures, and at\r\nnight bears and ghosts perform a burlesque and weird dance.\r\n\r\nThe spirit as well as the style of this poem is Romantic to a certain\r\npoint; there are declamations against the clumsy, didactic poetry of\r\nthe day, against utilitarianism as applied to poetry, and there is\r\nliterary satire (of Freiligrath, Karl Mayer, Gustav Pfizer) in the\r\nstyle favoured by the Romanticists.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there is sedulous realism in the representation of localities\r\nand circumstances. Strictly speaking, the poem is simply an account of\r\na stay which Heine and a young French lady friend make at Cauterets\r\nin the Pyrenees, where they see a bear dance in the market-place. The\r\nbear escapes from his master, takes flight to the mountains, where he\r\nis hunted down, shot, and flayed by Laskaro, the guide. The poet's\r\nJuliette gets the skin to lay on the floor by her bed; and Heine gives\r\nus the superfluous information that many a night he himself has stood\r\nbare-footed on this same skin.\r\n\r\nSo the tale is realistic enough. The details of the journey too are\r\nfaithfully reproduced. We get the impression that Heine's description\r\nof the little mountain town up to which he clambered, and where the\r\nchildren danced in a circle to the accompaniment of their own singing,\r\nexactly corresponds with what he saw and heard. Even the refrain of the\r\nsong: _Girofflino, Girofflette_, is doubtless the real one.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the finest, most powerful parts of this poem are not in\r\nthe least realistic. They are visions. And the finest vision is that\r\nin which by night from the window of the cottage the poet watches the\r\nwhole Wild Hunt tear three times round the horizon. He never did finer\r\nfigure-painting than the passage in which we follow the shining figures\r\nacross the darkness of the night sky--Diana, the fairy Abunde, and\r\nthe beautiful Herodias, in wild wantonness playing at ball with the\r\nBaptist's bloody head.\r\n\r\nA parallel may be drawn between Heine's art and that of Rembrandt.\r\nThere is nothing academic about either of them; both bear the distinct\r\nstamp of modernity. But when we call Heine a great realistic poet,\r\nwe make an assertion of the same qualified truth as when we call\r\nRembrandt the great colourist. Rembrandt cannot be said to be one of\r\nthe greatest colour-realists, for the reason that several painters\r\nsurpass him in the power of reproducing local colour and its exact\r\nvalue, and of showing the actual form and colour of an object seen in\r\nhalf darkness. It is not colour, but light, that is the main thing\r\nwith Rembrandt.[9] To him light is life; the battle of life is the\r\nbattle of light, and the tragedy of life is the tragedy of light,\r\nstruggling and dying in damp and darkness. To indicate in what his real\r\ngreatness as a painter lies, he ought rather to be called a luminist\r\n(an expression of Fromentin's) than a colourist, if by luminist we\r\nunderstand an artist whose specialty is the apprehension and treatment\r\nof light. He sometimes sacrifices drawing, even painting, in his\r\neagerness to produce some effect of light. Think, for example, of the\r\nbadly painted corpse in the _Lesson in Anatomy_. But it is exactly\r\nwhat makes him less successful than the realists in tasks requiring\r\nabsolute truthfulness--the painting of hands, the exact reproduction of\r\nstuffs--that makes him so great when he causes light to express what it\r\nalone indicates to him, the inner life, the world of waking visions.\r\n\r\n[9] _Cf_. Fromentin: _Les maîtres d'autrefois_.\r\n\r\nSomething similar to this is the case with Heine. How few real figures\r\nthis great poet has bequeathed to us! Those who would measure his\r\ndeserts by what he has done in this way find themselves obliged to fall\r\nback upon that crude, grotesque sketch of an old Jew servant, Hyacinth,\r\nas his best character.\r\n\r\nNo, if Heine is to be judged by his pictures of real life, many an\r\ninferior poet surpasses him.\r\n\r\nBut think of his visions, of the world of waking dreams in his poems\r\nand in his prose! As a rule he starts closer to earth than other\r\npoets, but presently, above the darkness of earth a gleaming vision\r\nappears--and disappears.\r\n\r\nThis is felt even in such small poems as the one already referred to\r\nas containing the talk in the fisherman's cottage about the Ganges and\r\nLapland.\r\n\r\nThink too of the way in which Heine calls up the image of Napoleon\r\nbefore his readers. In the _Two Grenadiers_ it has the effect of a\r\nvision. The words, \"Dann reitet mein Kaiser wohl über mein Grab\" ('Tis\r\nmy Emperor riding, right over my grave), are like a revelation in the\r\ndarkness of night, illuminated by the glitter of swords. In the equally\r\nadmirable description in the _Reisebilder_, the vision is conjured up\r\nin the form of a recollection of childhood.\r\n\r\nOr remember how Heine brings the image of Jesus before us. In the poem\r\n_Frieden_ (\"Peace\") he sees him, robed in glittering white, striding\r\nover the waves. In _Deutschland, ein Wintermärchen_ (\"Germany, a\r\nWinter's Tale\"), he paints a grey, winter morning on the Paderborn\r\nheath; when the mist rises, he sees by the side of the road, in\r\nthe dawning light, a wooden crucifix with the image of the great\r\nenthusiast, who desired to save mankind, and now hangs there \"as a\r\nwarning to others.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Sie haben dir übel mitgespielt,\r\n    Die Herren vom hohen Rathe.\"[10]\r\n\r\n[10]\r\n\r\n   A sorry trick they played thee indeed,\r\n   The lords of the council stately.\r\n                              (BOWRING)\r\n\r\nThe heart-felt sadness, the bitter humour, that find expression in\r\nfamiliar, disparaging comment, heighten the impression of human\r\ngrandeur, of solemn horror, much as this same impression is intensified\r\nwhen Hamlet, hearing his father's ghost under ground, calls: \"Well\r\nsaid, old mole! Canst work i' the earth so fast?\" In the flash of\r\nHeine's wit the reader sees Jesus, not now as the Prince of Peace, but\r\nas the man who scourged the desecrators of the Temple and sent fire\r\nupon earth.\r\n\r\n_The Winter 's Tale_ is, taken as a whole, a characteristic example\r\nof Heine's artistic procedure. All the twenty-seven divisions of the\r\nlong poem are constructed on the same plan. They begin close to earth,\r\nmaterially, with reminiscences of travel, vulgar realistic impressions;\r\nthen the writer, without warning, by unnoticeable transitions, rises\r\nto the height of passion, to powerful pathos, wild contempt, glowing\r\nadmiration, destructive or constructive enthusiasm, divine madness\r\nthat, as it were, rolls thunderbolt on thunderbolt; and then all sinks\r\nback once more into the grey dulness of everyday events and situations.\r\n\r\nHeine arrives at Cologne, sups on an omelet and ham, drinks a bottle\r\nof Rhenish wine, and then saunters out into the streets. He calls the\r\ntown's past days to mind: here the priests had free play, here men and\r\nbooks were burned at the stake; here stupidity and malice wantoned like\r\ndogs on the open street. Suddenly in the moonlight the Cathedral, the\r\ngreat spiritual Bastille, appears to his sight and arouses his wrath.\r\nAs he saunters along, he catches sight of a figure behind him which\r\nit seems to him he ought to know. And now we glide into a perfectly\r\nnew world, the world of vision. The figure follows him as if it were\r\nhis shadow, stopping when he stops. He has often noticed it beside\r\nhim before, when he sat late at night at his desk. Under its cloak\r\nit holds, and always has held, something that glitters strangely and\r\nthat resembles an axe, an executioner's axe. This figure is the poet's\r\nlictor, who follows his master, instead of preceding him as the Roman\r\nlictor did.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding divisions Barbarossa reveals himself in the same\r\nvisionary style, coming and going twice.\r\n\r\nHeine is an epoch-maker, not only in German lyric poetry, but in poetry\r\nin general. He introduced a new style, the combination of sentiment\r\nand humour in lyric poetry, and a new idea, the introduction of prose\r\ninto poetry, either by way of foil or by way of parody. His position\r\nas epoch-maker is due to his historic position, to his having lived\r\nat the period when Romantic perversion of reality was giving way to\r\npessimistic realism; this explains the fusion of the two elements which\r\nwe find in his writings.\r\n\r\nHence, too, it comes that the most characteristic domain in the\r\nprovince of his art is the domain of chiaroscuro, a chiaroscuro akin to\r\nRembrandt's.\r\n\r\nTo make the central objects stand out from the shadow or half-darkness\r\nin which they are concealed; to make light, natural light, produce a\r\nghostly, supernatural effect by conjuring it forth from a sea of dark\r\nshadow-waves, bringing it flickering or flaring out of half-darkness;\r\nto make darkness penetrable, half-darkness transparent--this is\r\nRembrandt's art.\r\n\r\nHeine's, which is closely related, consists in gradually,\r\nimperceptibly, conjuring forth out of the world of reality, and back\r\ninto it again, a perfectly modern, fantastic dreamworld.\r\n\r\nAt times the vision is in a full blaze of light, and the reality hidden\r\nin black darkness; but presently the vision fades, and the reality\r\ngradually emerges into the light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nHEINE AND GOETHE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that Heine, when a student in Bonn,\r\nconceived an enthusiastic admiration for the founder of the Romantic\r\nschool. A. W. Schlegel's personality was as attractive to him as his\r\nteaching. In Schlegel, Heine admired the man who had guided German\r\npoetry from artificiality to truth. He was dazzled, too, by the\r\nfashionable professor's aristocratic bearing, his knowledge of the\r\nworld, his acquaintance with the good society and famous people of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nHe was also touched by the kindly interest which Schlegel showed in\r\nhimself and his first literary efforts. It was to Schlegel that he was\r\nindebted for his early initiation into the secrets of metrical art, and\r\nfor something more valuable still, confidence in his own powers and his\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIn Heine's first prose article, that on Romanticism, written in 1820,\r\nhe expresses his gratitude and makes his Romantic confession of faith\r\nin the same breath. He protests against the idea of Romanticism being\r\n\"a mixture of Spanish enamel, Scotch mists, and Italian jingle\"; no,\r\nRomantic poetry ought not to be obscure and vague; its images may\r\nbe as plastic in contour as those of classic poetry. \"Hence it is,\"\r\nhe writes, \"that our two greatest Romanticists, Goethe and A. W.\r\nSchlegel, are at the same time our greatest plastic artists.\" And he\r\nnames Goethe's _Faust_ and Schlegel's _Rome_ in the same breath, as\r\nmodels of plastic outline, concluding pathetically: \"O, that those\r\nwho love to call themselves Schlegelians would lay this to heart!\"\r\nThis passage should be noted by those whose only knowledge of Heine's\r\nconnection with Schlegel is derived from the low attack on the latter's\r\nprivate life in _Die Romantische Schule_. It was to A. W. Schlegel,\r\nmoreover, that Heine addressed his three first sonnets. In the earliest\r\nhe thanks him for his personal kindness, and declares his own great\r\nindebtedness to him; in the second he extols him for the service which\r\nhe has rendered to German poetry by banishing that caricature in hoop\r\nand patches which in his day figured as the Muse; in the third he\r\npraises him for his introduction of English, Spanish, early German,\r\nItalian, and Indian poetry into modern German literature. The tone is\r\nenthusiastic:\r\n\r\n   \"Der schlimmste Wurm: des Zweifels Dolchgedanken,\r\n    Das schlimmste Gift: an eigner Kraft verzagen,\r\n    Das wollt' mir fast des Lebens Mark zernagen;\r\n    Ich war ein Reis, dem seine Stützen sanken.\r\n\r\n    Da mochtest du das arme Reis beklagen,\r\n    An deinem güt'gen Wort lässt du es ranken,\r\n    Und dir, mein hoher Meister, soll ich's danken,\r\n    Wird einst das schwache Reislein Blüthen tragen,\" &c.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] The most dangerous worm--doubt, with its dagger tooth; the most\r\ndeadly poison--distrust of one's own powers, were eating away my life;\r\nI was a sapling bereft of its supports.\r\n\r\nThou hadst pity on the poor sapling, thou gavest it the support of\r\nencouraging word; if ever the weak sapling blossoms, thine, great\r\nmaster, be the praise.\r\n\r\nIt is under this first Romantic influence that Heine writes his\r\nearliest, purely Romantic poems in archaistic style, verses like:\r\n\r\n   \"Die du bist so schön und rein,\r\n    Wunnevolles Magedein,\r\n    Deinem Dienste ganz allein\r\n    Möcht' ich wohl mein Leben weihn.\r\n\r\n    Deine süssen Aeugelein\r\n    Glänzen mild wie Mondenschein,\r\n    Helle Rosenlichter streun\r\n    Deine rothen Wängelein.\"\r\n\r\nThis reminds us forcibly of Tieck's earliest verses, those introduced\r\ninto his tales. In the one little poem from which these stanzas are\r\ntaken, we come upon Wunne, Magedein, Aeugelein, Wängelein, Mündchen,\r\nweiland, a whole string of diminutives and archaisms.\r\n\r\nHeine's next model was a genial, true poet, who died in 1827, at\r\nthe early age of thirty-one--Wilhelm Müller, the author of the\r\n_Müllerlieder_, particularly well known from Schubert's musical\r\nsetting, and of the _Griechenlieder_, which were equally admired in\r\ntheir day. A son of Wilhelm Müller's is the well-known German-English\r\nphilologist, Max Müller, whose novel, _Deutsche Liebe_, the story\r\nof the tender love of a young German savant for a sickly, bedridden\r\nprincess, is said to be based on events in his father's life.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of June 1826, Heine writes to Müller: \"I am magnanimous\r\nenough to confess frankly that the resemblance of my little Intermezzo\r\nmetre [the one most frequently employed by Heine] to your usual\r\nmetre is not purely accidental; the secret of its cadence was in all\r\nprobability learned from your verses.\" He goes on to explain that he\r\nhad early felt the influence of the German popular ballad and song,\r\nand that at Bonn, Schlegel had initiated him into the art of verses;\r\n\"but,\" he adds, \"it is in your verse that I seem for the first time\r\nto have found the clear ring, the true simplicity, which I have always\r\naimed at. How clear, how simple your poems are, and they are one and\r\nall popular poems. In mine only the form is popular; the ideas are\r\nthose of conventional society.\"\r\n\r\nIt was from Müller that Heine first learned how to evolve new popular\r\nforms out of the old. To behold as it were with our own eyes the birth\r\nand growth of Heine's style, we only need to set certain of his verses\r\nalongside of Müller's.\r\n\r\nMüller writes:\r\n\r\n   \"Wir sassen so traulich beisammen\r\n    Im kühlen Erlendach,\r\n    Wir schauten so traulich zusammen\r\n    Hinab in den rieselnden Bach.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Heine:\r\n\r\n   \"Wir sassen am Fischerhause\r\n    Und schauten nach der See,\r\n    Die Abendnebel kamen\r\n    Und stiegen in die Höh'.\"\r\n\r\nHow closely this last stanza resembles such a stanza of Müller's as:\r\n\r\n   \"Die Abendnebel sinken\r\n    Hernieder kalt und schwer,\r\n    Und Todesengel schweben\r\n    In ihren Dampf umher.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[2] Wilhelm Müller: _Gedichte_, i. p. 26; \"Thränenregen,\" p. 194;\r\n\"Dasselbe noch einmal.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the introductory lines of a long, beautiful poem called\r\n_Hirtenbiwouak in der römischen Campagna_, the most important part of\r\nwhich is the shepherd's song of longing for his sweetheart. How much\r\nHeine must have learned from such a verse as that which describes the\r\nyoung girl:\r\n\r\n   \"Darunter sitzt ein Mädchen,\r\n    Die Spindel in der Hand,\r\n    Und spinnt und sinnt und schauet\r\n    Herab in's eb'ne Land.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not find Wilhelm Müller marring the impression of his idyll by\r\nany sudden revulsion of mood; there is nothing of the devil in him; the\r\ngentle andante is maintained to the end of the piece. But it is not in\r\nthis that the principal difference between his style and Heine's lies;\r\nfor Heine at times retains his tranquil mood throughout a whole poem.\r\nThe essential difference is the extraordinary condensation of Heine's\r\nstyle, as compared with Müller's. He gives in one verse, at most two,\r\nwhat the other requires ten to express.\r\n\r\nThe novelty in his lyric style is its unparalleled condensation. The\r\npoems are all epitomes. They present us with a spiced, fragrant essence\r\nof passion, experience, bitterness, mockery, wit, emotion, and fancy;\r\nan essence of poetry and prose in combination. Psychologists talk of a\r\ncondensation of thought;[3] in comparison with the pupil's thought,\r\nthe master's is condensed. In the history of all mechanism, increasing\r\ncondensation is to be observed. Once there were only church clocks; now\r\npeople carry clocks in their pockets. That is to say, the mechanism\r\nwhich once required for its wheels and springs the space provided by a\r\nchurch clock, now finds room enough in a watch. In like manner, many an\r\nold tragedy does not contain more thoughts or more feeling than a Heine\r\npoem of two or three verses.\r\n\r\n[3] Lazarus: _Das Leben der Seele_, 2nd edition, p. 229.\r\n\r\nHeine's short stanza has, then, two advantages over Wilhelm\r\nMüllers--more passion, and much greater condensation of style.\r\n\r\nIn his favourite short iambic metre, Heine is influenced by Wilhelm\r\nMüller, in his trochees he resembles another Romantic, far more\r\nRomantic poet, Clemens Brentano. In Heine's _Romancero_ there are some\r\ncurious correspondences with Brentano's _Romanzen vom Rosenkranze_\r\n(\"Romances of the Rosary\"). These latter were written before\r\n_Romancero_, but as they were not published till 1853, Heine cannot\r\npossibly have been influenced by them.\r\n\r\nIn the second of the _Rosary Romances_ we read of the hero, Cosmo,\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n   \"Aus dem Wasserspiegel mahnt\r\n    Ihn des Alters ernste Bote:\r\n    Du wirst bald die Schuld bezahlen,\r\n    Spricht des Hauptes Silberlocke.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[4] The solemn messengers of age, the white locks of the man who gazes\r\nat him from the water-mirror, cry: Soon thou must pay thy debt.\r\n\r\nIn Heine's posthumous poem _Bimini_, one  of the divisions begins:\r\n\r\n   \"Einsam auf dem Strand von Cuba,\r\n    Vor dem stillen Wasserspiegel,\r\n    Steht ein Mensch und er betrachtet\r\n    In der Flut sein Konterfei.\r\n\r\n    Eben nicht mit sonderlichem\r\n    Wohlgefallen scheint der Greis\r\n    In dem Wasser zu betrachten\r\n    Sein bekümmert Spiegelbildniss.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[5]\r\n\r\n    On the shore of Cuba's island\r\n    Stands an old man solitary,\r\n    Gazing at his own reflection\r\n    In the tranquil water-mirror.\r\n\r\n    Not with any special pleasure\r\n    Does the sad and aged man\r\n    See beneath him in the water\r\n    His own image, sorrowful.\r\n\r\nMetre, situation, idea are identical in the two passages.\r\n\r\nThere is also a certain resemblance between the tale of a mystery-book\r\nin the Ninth Romance of the Rosary and the story of the beautiful\r\ncasket in Heine's poem of _Jehuda ben Halevy_.[6] Only that Brentano's\r\nstory of the passing of the mystery-book from hand to hand, through\r\nmany ages, merely opens up to us a Romantic wonder-world, whereas\r\nHeine's tale of the wanderings of the casket is at the same time a jest\r\nat the vicissitudes of life: the pearls first belong to Smerdis, who\r\ngives them to Atossa, then to the great Alexander, who gives them to\r\nThais, then in course of time to Cleopatra, to a Moorish sultan, to\r\nthe regalia of Castille, and to the Baroness Solomon Rothschild, in a\r\ncompliment to whom the life-history of the casket terminates.\r\n\r\n[6] _Cf_. Eduard Grisebach; _Die deutsche Litteratur_, p. 254, &c.;\r\nwhere, however, a definite influence is insisted on, regardless of\r\nHeine's priority.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that Heine is indebted to Clemens Brentano for the\r\nsubject of what in Germany is the best known and most sung of all his\r\nsongs, the song of _Lorelei_, \"Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten.\"\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1802 Brentano had published, in his _Godwi,_ a ballad\r\nentitled \"Lorelei.\" It is not the story of a siren, but of a young girl\r\nof Bacharach on the Rhine, who was so beautiful that all men fell in\r\nlove with her. She was accused of witchcraft. But the bishop, who ought\r\nto have condemned her to be burned, fell in love with her himself. She\r\ndesires to die, for the one man she loves will have nothing to say\r\nto her and has gone away; so, on her way to the convent to which the\r\nbishop is sending her, she climbs a high cliff, Lurelei (Ley means\r\nslate-rock), and in despairing longing for her beloved, throws herself\r\ninto the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThis ballad suggested to a writer called Nikolaus Vogt the fabrication\r\nof a Rhine legend, which he published in 1811, passing it off as an\r\nold one. In it Lorelei, on her way to the convent, sees the man of her\r\nheart sail past her on the Rhine, and throws herself from the cliff in\r\ngrief at having failed to win him. Three of her adorers follow her to a\r\nwatery grave. Hence a rock in that neighbourhood is known by the name\r\nof the Dreiritterstein (Rock of the Three Knights). The last incident\r\nwas perhaps suggested by the ending of Brentano's poem:\r\n\r\n   \"Wer hat dies' Lied gesungen?\r\n    Ein Schiffer auf dem Rhein.\r\n    Und immer hat geklungen\r\n    Vom hohen Felsenstein:\r\n       Lore Lay!\r\n       Lore Lay!\r\n       Lore Lay!\r\n    Als wären es unser Drei.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[7] Who was it sang this song? A boatman on the Rhine. And still we\r\nheard the cry, from the high cliff overhead: \"Lore Lay! Lore Lay! Lore\r\nLay!\" Me-seemed that we were three.\r\n\r\nFrom this fabricated legend a certain Count Loeben, in 1821, took the\r\ntheme for a poem, _Lorelei_,[8] in which the young girl who drowns\r\nherself is transformed into a mermaid, whose singing lures into the\r\ndepths those who are sailing past:\r\n\r\n   \"Da wo der Mondschein blitzet\r\n    Um's hohe Felsgestein,\r\n    Das Zauberfräulein sitzet\r\n    Und schauet auf den Rhein.\r\n\r\n    Es schauet herüber, hinüber,\r\n    Es schauet hinab, hinauf,\r\n    Die Schifflein ziehen vorüber,\r\n    Lieb' Knabe, sieh nicht auf!\r\n\r\n    Sie singt dir hold am Ohre,\r\n    Sie blickt dich thöricht an,\r\n    Sie ist die schöne Lore,\r\n    Sie hat dir's angethan,\" &c.[9]\r\n\r\n[8] A. Strodtmann: H. Heine's _Leben und Werke_, 2nd edition, i. 696.\r\n\r\n[9] Where the moonlight glitters on the lofty cliff, there the\r\nmagic-maiden sits, and gazes on the Rhine. She looks across the stream,\r\nlooks up the stream and down; softly the boats glide past-look not\r\non her, O youth! She sings so sweetly in your ear, she looks at you\r\nbewitchingly; she is the lovely Lore, and in her spells you're caught.\r\n\r\nNow take Heine's world-famed poem, first a students' song, then a\r\npopular song, melting and thrilling with the tender harmony of melody\r\nand words. The direct imitation is unmistakable. The theme is the\r\nsame, the metre is the same, even some of the rhymes are the same:\r\n\"blitzet--sitzet;\" instead of \"an--gethan, Kahn--gethan.\" But what a\r\ndifference! Feeling has been added. First the personal starting-point,\r\nthe inexplicable melancholy of the narrator and his inability to banish\r\nthe old legend from his thoughts, then the instantaneous, clear,\r\ndefinite picture of the landscape:\r\n\r\n   \"Die Luft ist kühl, und es dunkelt,\r\n      Und ruhig fliesst der Rhein,\r\n    Der Gipfel des Berges funkelt\r\n      Im Abendsonnenschein.\r\n\r\n    Die schönste Jungfrau sitzet\r\n      Dort oben wunderbar,\r\n    Ihr gold'nes Geschmeide blitzet,\r\n      Sie kämmt ihr goldenes Haar.\"[10]\r\n\r\n[10]\r\n\r\n    The cool air darkens, and listen,\r\n    How softly flows the Rhine!\r\n    The mountain peaks still glisten\r\n    Where the evening sunbeams shine.\r\n\r\n   The fairest maid sits dreaming\r\n   In radiant beauty there.\r\n   Her gold and her jewels are gleaming,\r\n   She combeth her golden hair.\r\n                         (E. LAZARUS.)\r\n\r\nAnd something more has been added--that element of dæmonic passion\r\nwhich the earlier manipulators of the theme were unable to communicate\r\nto it. Heine here represents an elemental luring power, akin to that\r\ndelineated with simpler means and more powerful effect by Goethe in\r\n_Der Fischer_. But Goethe, in conformity with his nature, describes a\r\ntranquil, enchanting ensnarement; Heine, in conformity with his, an\r\ninstantaneous, irresistible, maddening bewitchment.\r\n\r\nA still more profound insight into Heine's art, in the making, and into\r\nthe manner in which his fancy deals with a theme, is perhaps to be\r\ngained by observing how he makes use of a subject which offers itself\r\nto him in prose.\r\n\r\nIn Henri Beyle's book, _De l'amour_, he evidently found the three\r\nfollowing anecdotes, translated from the Arabic. 1. Sahid ben Agba one\r\nday asked an Arab: \"Of what tribe art thou?\" \"Of that tribe,\" answered\r\nthe Arabian, \"in which men die when they love.\" \"Then thou art of the\r\ntribe of Asra?\" \"Yea, verily, by the Lord of Kaaba!\" \"Whence comes\r\nit that ye love thus?\" \"Our women are beautiful, and our young men\r\nchaste.\" 2. A man once asked Arua ben Hezam of the tribe of Asra: \"Is\r\nit true that ye love with a tenderness surpassing that of all other\r\nmen?\" \"It is true,\" answered Arua. \"Thirty young men of my tribe have\r\nI seen carried off by death, whose only sickness was that of love.\" 3.\r\nAn Arab of the tribe Beni-Fazarat said one day to an Arab of the tribe\r\nBeni-Asra: \"Ye think that to die of love is a sweet and noble death;\r\nwhereas it is nought but weakness and foolishness.\" \"Thou would'st\r\nnot speak so,\" answered the other, \"had'st thou seen the great dark,\r\nlong-lashed eyes of our veiled women, seen their teeth gleam between\r\ntheir brown lips when they smile.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the origin of Heine's famous _Der Asra_: \"Täglich ging die\r\nwunderschöne.\" He first paints the place for us--the garden with the\r\nfountain whose white waters flash; then he shows us the slave, standing\r\nthere every day when the sultan's daughter comes to walk, paler every\r\nday; then he tells how the princess one evening closely questions the\r\nslave: \"I would know thy name, thy race, thy family...\":\r\n\r\n   \"Und der Sklave sprach: 'ich heisse\r\n    Mohamet, ich bin aus Yemen\r\n    Und mein Stamm sind jene Asra,\r\n    Welche sterben, wenn sie lieben.'\"[11]\r\n\r\n[11]\r\n\r\n    Spake the youthful slave, \"My name is\r\n    Mahomet, I come from Yemen;\r\n    And by birth I am an Asra,\r\n    One who dieth when he loves.\"\r\n                          (E. LAZARUS.)\r\n\r\nHeine, as we see, has disdained all explanations. We enjoy the\r\nmarvellous conciseness of these monumental words, this power as it were\r\nof hewing out the speech in stone. But what, on closer investigation,\r\nis the spiritual substance of the poem? Not much more than a laconic\r\ncombination of the words love and death. It is the same combination\r\nthat is to be found in all Heine's youthful poems, in the shape of love\r\nand suffering, love and poison, love and suicide--in Alfred de Musset,\r\ntoo, there is the same stereotyped coupling of _l'amour_ and _la mort_.\r\n\r\nHere, as in general with Heine, the expression is epigrammatic,\r\ntherefore quite simple.\r\n\r\nWe have now sufficient material before us to give us a certain insight\r\ninto the formation of Heine's poetic style. It will be interesting to\r\nstudy it finished and fully developed.\r\n\r\nWe may start from the last-mentioned poem with its epigrammatic point.\r\nIt is characteristic of Heine that neither here nor elsewhere does he\r\ndeeply concern himself with the true inwardness of a feeling; he only,\r\nas a rule, points and sharpens the expression of it. This is the case\r\neven with the feeling of love, which he has treated more frequently\r\nthan any other. And it is characteristic of his want of the power to\r\nput himself in another's place, that it has only been possible for him\r\nto give expression to masculine love; he has never put a passionate\r\nutterance of feeling into the mouth of a woman.\r\n\r\nNothing would have been more impossible for Heine than to write such a\r\npoem as Goethe's famous:\r\n\r\n   \"Freudvoll und leidvoll,\r\n    Gedankenvoll sein,\r\n    Langen und bangen\r\n    In schwebender Pein,\r\n    Himmelhoch jauchzend,\r\n    Zum Tode betrübt,\r\n    Glücklich allein\r\n    Ist die Seele die liebt.\"[12]\r\n\r\n[12]\r\n\r\n    Gladness\r\n    And sadness\r\n    And pensiveness blending;\r\n    Yearning\r\n    And burning\r\n    In torment ne'er ending;\r\n    Sad unto death,\r\n    Proudly soaring above,\r\n    Happy alone\r\n    Is the soul that doth love.\r\n                      (BOWRING)\r\n\r\nFor this is the living delineation of a woman's heart, this is the very\r\ninner life of love, its pulsation, its oscillation between bliss and\r\nwoe. The epigrammatic quality of Heine's style alone would make such\r\nan unfolding of the emotional life impossible. And there is the same\r\nconcentration when he narrates an event. It is a condensation without\r\nparallel in poetry; he produces his effect by making the briefest\r\npossible statement or suggestion. As an example of this take the lines:\r\n\r\n   \"Es war ein alter König,\r\n      Sein Herz war schwer, sein Haupt war grau;\r\n    Der arme, alte König\r\n      Er nahm eine junge Frau.\r\n\r\n    Es war ein schöner Page,\r\n      Blond war sein Haupt, leicht war sein Sinn,\r\n    Er trug die seid'ne Schleppe\r\n      Der jungen Königin.\"[13]\r\n\r\n[13]\r\n\r\n    There was an aged monarch,\r\n      His heart was sad, his head was grey;\r\n    This foolish, fond old monarch\r\n      A young wife took one day.\r\n\r\n    There was a handsome page, too,\r\n      Fair was his hair and light his mien;\r\n    The silken train he carried\r\n      Of the beautiful young queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObserve the telling effect of the inversion: \"Blond war sein Haupt;\" it\r\nis as if the verse began to rejoice and dance. Then comes the end:\r\n\r\n   \"Kennst du das alte Liedchen?\r\n      Es klingt so süss, es klingt so trüb;\r\n    Sie mussten beide sterben,\r\n      Sie hatten sich viel zu lieb.\"[14]\r\n\r\n[14]\r\n\r\n    Dost know the ancient ballad?\r\n      It sounds so sweet, it sounds so sad:\r\n    Both of them had to perish\r\n      Too much love to each other they had.\r\n\r\nThis is admirable. But we are not told the story; we only suspect it as\r\nwe suspect the story of the slave and the sultan's daughter. And here\r\nagain love is coupled with death.\r\n\r\nA certain emptiness in Heine's conception of love strikes us here\r\nagain. This love has no real substance, no spiritual significance. It\r\nwas not till shortly before he lay down upon his death-bed that Heine\r\nbegan to describe a love that has real inward substance. The love of\r\nthe _Buch der Lieder_ is for the most part wrath excited by coldness or\r\nfaithlessness, an unfruitful thing, that awakens no sympathy. The later\r\nof the love-poems are frequently sensual or frivolous, and the more\r\nexaggerated the expression, the less are we affected by the value of\r\nthe feeling:\r\n\r\n   \"Mein Herz ist wie die Sonne,\r\n      So flammend anzuseh'n.\r\n    Und in ein Meer von Liebe\r\n      Versinkt es gross und schön.\"[15]\r\n\r\n15:\r\n\r\n    My heart is like the sun, dear,\r\n      Yon kindled flame above;\r\n    And sinks in large-orbed beauty\r\n      Within a sea of love.\r\n                      (E. LAZARUS.)\r\n\r\nThere is too much self-observation and too much boastfulness in this\r\nyouthful rodomontade. And it is the same with:\r\n\r\n   \"Ich hab' dich geliebet und liebe dich noch,\r\n      Und fiele die Welt zusammen,\r\n    Aus ihren Trummern stiegen doch\r\n      Hervor meiner Liebe Flammen.\"[16]\r\n\r\n16:\r\n\r\n   I have loved thee long, and I love thee now,\r\n     And, though the world should perish,\r\n   O'er its dying embers still would glow\r\n     The flames of the love I cherish.\r\n                                      (LELAND)\r\n\r\nAdmitting that this is probably so expressed for the sake of artistic\r\neffect, we must also admit that the style is a good, perfectly modern\r\nstyle. We can see it all with the mind's eye. The heart sinks like the\r\nsun into a sea. From the ruins of the world rise the flames of love.\r\nAnd still more powerful and much more picturesque is the scene in which\r\nthe name of Agnes is written on the vault of heaven. What is wanting is\r\nsubstance in the feeling. Think, for the sake of comparison, of those\r\nprofoundly human lines of Goethe's:\r\n\r\n   \"Kanntest jeden Zug in meinem Wesen,\r\n      Spähtest, wo die reinste Nerve klingt,\r\n    Konntest mich mit einem Blicke lesen,\r\n      Den so schwer ein sterblich Aug' durchdringt.\"[17]\r\n\r\n[17] Thou knewest every impulse of my nature, thine eye detected where\r\nthe nerve thrilled keenest, thou couldst read me at a glance, me, so\r\nimpenetrable to mortal eye.\r\n\r\n--or of the following, which complete the impression:\r\n\r\n   \"Tropftest Mässigung dem heissen Blute,\r\n      Richtetest den wilden, wirren Lauf,\r\n    Und in deinen Engelsarmen ruhte\r\n      Die zerstörte Brust sich wieder auf.\"[18]\r\n\r\n[18] The hot blood by thee was tempered, the wild, aimless course by\r\nthee directed; and in thine angel arms the torn breast found rest and\r\nhealing.\r\n\r\nThis is the expression of the healthiest, fullest, mutual sympathy,\r\nof love's gratitude, of perfect understanding. For such feeling Heine\r\ndid not find expression until, with the shadow of death upon him, he\r\nloved _la Mouche_, the guardian angel of his death-bed. Until then it\r\nis never the healthy, tranquillising, happy element in love that he\r\nconcerns himself with. It is in another domain that he is master. The\r\nmodern poet, he reproduces passionate desire with a Correggio-like\r\nblending of colours and tones that is more effective than Goethe's\r\nantique limpidity. With Goethe desire is Greek or Italian. Think, for\r\ninstance, of the poem of the orange:\r\n\r\n   \"Ich trete zu dem Baume\r\n    Und sage: Pomeranze!\r\n    Du reife Pomeranze;\r\n    Du süsse Pomeranze!\r\n    Ich schüttle, fühl', ich schüttle,\r\n    O fall in meinen Schoos!\"[19]\r\n\r\n[19]\r\n\r\n    I take my stand beneath the tree,\r\n        And cry: O orange!\r\n        O orange ripe!\r\n        O orange sweet!\r\n    Feel, feel how I shake thy tree!\r\n    O fall into my lap\r\n\r\nThen compare the feeling, the glow, the fragrance, the exuberance of\r\nsuch a poem of desire as Heine's wonderful: _Die Lotosblume ängstigt\r\nsich vor der Sonne Pracht_ (\"The lotus-flower is fearful of the sun's\r\nresplendent beam\").\r\n\r\nIt is very characteristic of the two poets that (as has already been\r\nnoted), whenever the representation of love-longing glides into a\r\ndelineation of foreign lands, Goethe prefers to paint Italy, Heine\r\nHindostan. In Mignon's song of longing, without a superlative or a\r\ndiminutive, with a power like that of a God, Goethe summons before our\r\neyes the picture of the classic land where the citrons bloom. There is\r\na power in it all, a force in each distinguishing trait, that Heine\r\ndoes not attain to. But compare this with the bewitching sweetness of\r\nHeine's _Auf Flügeln des Gesanges_ (\"Oh, I would bear thee, my love, my\r\nbride, afar on the wings of song\"), the dreamy longing, the charm and\r\nthe mystery of the perspective that opens out to us:\r\n\r\n   \"Es hüpfen herbei und lauschen\r\n      Die frommen, klugen Gazelln,\r\n    Und in der Ferne rauschen\r\n      Des heiligen Stromes Welln.\"[20]\r\n\r\n[20]\r\n\r\n    Gazelles come bounding from the brake,\r\n      And pause, and look shyly round;\r\n    And the waves of the sacred river make\r\n      A far-off slumb'rous sound.\r\n                    (Sir THEODORE MARTIN)\r\n\r\nThis is an immortal stanza. Goethe, even when he gives the reins to\r\nlonging, is always, like his own goldsmith of Ephesus, the great, wise\r\nheathen, who makes images of the gods; in Heine's visionary brain there\r\nwas that particle of divine frenzy without which it had been impossible\r\nfor the Düsseldorf merchant's son to understand and reproduce the\r\nfatalistic, self-effacing dreaminess of ancient India.\r\n\r\nHeine's peculiarities of style stand out even more sharply against the\r\nbackground of Goethe's, when we compare the way in which the two give\r\nexpression to what is not exactly desire, but the pure longing of love.\r\n\r\nThink of the following lines, which Goethe puts into Mignon's mouth:\r\n\r\n   \"Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt, weiss was ich leide,\r\n    Allein und abgetrennt von aller Freude,\r\n    Seh' ich an's Firmament nach jener Seite.\r\n    Ach, der mich liebt und kennt, ist in der Weite.--\r\n    Es schwindelt mir, es brennt mein Eingeweide.\r\n    Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt, weiss was ich leide.\"[21]\r\n\r\n21:\r\n\r\n    My grief no mortals know, except the yearning!\r\n    Alone, a prey to woe, all pleasure spurning,\r\n    Up towards the sky I throw a gaze discerning.\r\n    He who my love doth know seems ne'er returning;\r\n    With strange and fiery glow _my heart is burning_[*]\r\n    My grief no mortals know, except the yearning.\r\n                                           (BOWRING)\r\n\r\n[*]In the original, _my bowels are burning_.\r\n\r\nThis is the master in the fulness of his power. Much art has been\r\nexpended in the representation of the wearing monotony of longing--the\r\nfive doubly rhyming lines, the languishing metre--interrupted by\r\nthe audacious, realistic expression: \"Es schwindelt mir, es brennt\r\nmein Eingeweide.\" Now compare with this, one of Heine's most perfect\r\nexpressions of pure love-longing, and we shall see what the plastic\r\nfancy and the perfected laconicism of style which we traced in course\r\nof development have succeeded in producing for time and eternity:\r\n\r\n   \"Ein Fichtenbaum steht einsam\r\n      Im Norden auf kahler Höh'.\r\n    Ihn schläfert: mit weisser Decke\r\n      Umhüllen ihn Eis und Schnee.\r\n\r\n    Er träumt von einer Palme,\r\n      Die fern im Morgenland\r\n    Einsam und schweigend trauert\r\n      Auf brennender Felsenwand.\"[22]\r\n\r\n[22]\r\n\r\n    A pine-tree stands alone on\r\n      A bare bleak northern height;\r\n    The ice and snow they swathe it\r\n      As it sleeps there, all in white.\r\n\r\n    'Tis dreaming of a palm-tree,\r\n      In a far-off Eastern land,\r\n    That mourns, alone and silent,\r\n      On a ledge of burning sand.\r\n             (Sir THEODORE MARTIN.)\r\n\r\nThis is hardly rhymed. The only real rhyme is the very commonplace\r\n_Land_ and _Wand_. The pine dreams in the snow, the palm grieves\r\ndumbly in the burning heat--that is all. It is not seen, it is fancied\r\nor invented, hence it cannot be painted (though I did once see a\r\npainting of it in a German exhibition, an idiotically absurd, double\r\npicture); but it is, nevertheless, an unforgettable, an immortal poem.\r\nAnd the reason is that the symbol is so marvellously effective in its\r\nsimplicity--these two clear outlines instinct with feeling, which\r\nexpress the impossibility of overcoming the obstacle which prevents\r\nthe union of two who really belong to each other.\r\n\r\nIf Goethe's strength lies in the expression of healthy feelings,\r\ncomparatively simple and uncomplicated, Heine's lies in the expression\r\nof complex modern feeling, of feelings whose unsound state is the\r\nresult of painful experiences. Goethe could never have written the\r\nfollowing lines, with their jarring contrasts and enigmatical meaning:\r\n\r\n   \"Wenn ich in deine Augen seh'\r\n    So schwindet all mein Leid und Weh:\r\n      .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n    Doch wenn du sprichst: ich liebe dich!\r\n    So muss ich weinen bitterlich.\"[23]\r\n\r\n[23]\r\n\r\n    Whene'er I look into thine eyes,\r\n    Then every fear that haunts me flies:\r\n      .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n    But when thou sayest: \"I love thee;\"\r\n    Then must I weep, and bitterly.\r\n                 (Sir THEODORE MARTIN)\r\n\r\nWhy must he weep? I have heard the naïve answer: Because she is lying.\r\nAlas! it is not such a simple matter as that. He has heard these words\r\nfrom other lips, lips which have now ceased to utter words of love; he\r\nknows how long such a passion as a rule lasts, and the sound of her\r\nvoice startles him out of his forgetfulness--he doubts the durability\r\nof her feeling or the durability of his own. It is very interesting to\r\nnote the way in which Heine had wrestled with these words. Originally\r\nthe last line was: \"Dann wein' ich still und bitterlich.\" Then the\r\nword \"bitterlich\" was altered to \"freudiglich,\" which changed the\r\noriginal tenor of the poem, and finally the line received its present\r\nform.[24]\r\n\r\n[24] H. Hüffer: _Aus dem Leben Heinrich Heines,_ p. 153.\r\n\r\nHeine was not happy enough and not great enough to attain\r\nto reconciliation with existence. It was not possible, apart from all\r\nelse, that the man who was so long an exile, so long sick to death,\r\nshould look upon life with the same eyes as the man who was thoroughly\r\nsound and healthy, in affluent circumstances, honoured by the great\r\nmajority, the friend of his sovereign. Hence the expressions of revolt,\r\nof bitterness, and of cynicism so frequently to be found in Heine are\r\nexceedingly rare in Goethe. Goethe, as a rule, puts them into the\r\nmouth of his Mephistopheles. Heine, who was destitute of the dramatic\r\nfaculty, is himself responsible for every outburst, because he always\r\nspeaks in his own name. Goethe's bitterest utterances, moreover, are\r\nnot contained in his works. It is only in the Paralipomena to _Faust_,\r\nfor instance, that we find this passage:\r\n\r\n   \"Nach kurzem Lärm legt Fama sich zur Ruh,\r\n      Vergessen wird der Held so wie der Lotterbube,\r\n    Der grösste König schliesst die Augen zu,\r\n      Und jeder Hund bepisst gleich seine Grube.\"[25]\r\n\r\n[25]\r\n\r\n    Fame's short-liv'd turmoil o'er, she sleeps,\r\n      Hero and waif, oblivion's their doom;\r\n    The greatest king, life o'er, his eyes doth close,\r\n      And straightway every dog defiles his tomb.\r\n\r\nHeine dwells upon the ideas which Goethe only calls up to banish\r\nagain. Goethe, too, can be blasphemous. He wrote that poem which is so\r\nfrequently quoted, so seldom understood: _Wer nie sein Brod mit Thränen\r\nass_ (\"He that with tears did never eat his bread\"). It is a bitter,\r\npassionate appeal against the ordering of the world. But its bitterness\r\nis a bitterness that is choked with tears, not the wild and desperate\r\nbitterness of Heine's splendid _Fragen_ (\"Questions\") or the poem _Lass\r\ndie heiligen Parabeln_ (\"Holy parable discarding\"), in which occur the\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n   \"Warum schleppt sich blutend, elend,\r\n      Unter Kreuzlast der Gerechte,\r\n    Während glücklich als ein Sieger\r\n      Trabt auf hohem Ross der Schlechte?\r\n\r\n    Also fragen wir beständig,\r\n      Bis man uns mit einer Handvoll\r\n    Erde endlich stopft die Mäuler,\r\n      Aber ist das eine Antwort?\"[26]\r\n\r\n[26]\r\n\r\n    Wherefore bends the Just One, bleeding\r\n      'Neath the cross's weight laborious,\r\n    While upon his steed the Wicked\r\n      Rides all-proudly and victorious?\r\n\r\n    Thus are we for ever asking,\r\n      Till at length our mouths securely\r\n    With a clod of earth are fastened--\r\n      That is not an answer, surely?\r\n                     (BOWRING)\r\n\r\nThe expression is here, as usual with Heine, on a lower plane, more\r\nterrestrial, more boldly outspoken, yet by no means unworthy of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nOutbursts of satiety and weariness of life are not infrequent with\r\nhim. We do not need to search long among his poems to find expressions\r\nof the mood of having done for good and all with principle, with\r\nendeavour. Nothing of this kind is to be found in Goethe. His _Vanitas\r\nvanitatum_, the song _Ich hab' meine Sache auf Nichts gestellt_ (\"My\r\ntrust in nothing now is placed\") has, very significantly, become a\r\nconvivial drinking song. In other words, there is no real, bitter\r\nearnest about Goethe's desperation; therefore it soon changes into\r\njovial recklessness. Goethe has not Heine's overpowering feeling of the\r\nmisery of life, and in so far he is really less Christian.\r\n\r\nIf it is instructive to compare the two poets' lyric expression of\r\nfatalistic indifference, it is equally so to compare their expression\r\nof the feeling of aspiration, of manly resolve. In this case we may\r\ntake the song _Feiger Gedanken_ (\"Cowardly Thoughts\") from _Claudine\r\nvon Villa Bella_, as characteristic of Goethe; it might serve as a\r\nmotto for his conduct throughout life. One can hardly imagine a more\r\nvigorous expression of manly determination than that of the lines:\r\n\"Allen Gewalten zum Trutz sich erhalten,\" &c. (A bold front shown, to\r\npowers of earth and heaven).\r\n\r\nCompare with this Heine's poem, _An die Jungen_ (\"To the Young\"). The\r\nimpetuous rush of the rhythm and the picturesque quadruple rhyme would\r\nalone suffice to make this a splendid, fascinating composition. The\r\nfirst verse, with its allusion to the golden apples which Hippomenes\r\ndropped in front of Atalanta, is a whole poem in itself:\r\n\r\n   \"Lass dich nicht kirren, lass dich nicht wirren\r\n      Durch goldne Aepfel in deinem Lauf.\r\n    Die Schwerter klirren, die Pfeile schwirren,\r\n      Doch halten sie nicht den Helden auf.\"[27]\r\n\r\n[27] Heed not the confusion, resist the illusion Of golden apples that\r\nlie in thy way! The swords are clashing, the arrows are flashing, But\r\nthey cannot long the hero delay. (BOWRING.)\r\n\r\nFrom the picture and example of the hero, who will not be stopped\r\nin his career, we pass to that of Alexander. What is wanted is\r\ndetermination and boldness:\r\n\r\n   \"Ein kühnes Beginnen ist halbes Gewinnen,\r\n      Ein Alexander erbeutet die Welt,\r\n    Kein langes Besinnen! Die Königinnen\r\n      Erwarten schon kniend den Sieger im Zelt.\r\n\r\n    Wir wagen und werben! besteigen als Erben\r\n      Des alten Darius' Bett und Thron.\r\n    O süsses Verderben! o blühender Sterben!\r\n      Berauschter Triumphtod zu Babylon!\"[28]\r\n\r\n28:\r\n\r\n     A daring beginning is half way to winning,\r\n       An Alexander once conquered the earth!\r\n     Restrain each soft feeling! the queens are all kneeling\r\n       In the tent, to reward thy victorious worth.\r\n\r\n     Surmounting each burden, we win as our guerdon\r\n       The bed of Darius of old, and his crown;\r\n     O deadly seduction! O blissful destruction!\r\n       To die drunk with triumph in Babylon town.\r\n                                            (BOWRING.)\r\n\r\nUpon victory follows the homage of the queens, then sweet perdition,\r\nseductive ruin, death in the intoxication of triumph--what\r\nSardanapalian sentiment in this appeal to youth, this exhortation to\r\nrelentless determination! The fight here is for honour, and for women\r\nas the spoil of battle, not that struggle for the combatant's own\r\nindividual freedom, of which Goethe writes so simply:\r\n\r\n   \"Nimmer sich beugen,\r\n    Kräftig sich zeigen,\r\n    Rufet die Arme\r\n    Der Götter herbei.\"[29]\r\n\r\n29:\r\n\r\n    Nevermore yield thee!\r\n    Show life has steeled thee!\r\n    Thus call the arms of\r\n    The Gods to thine aid.\r\n\r\nGoethe's feeling is purer and fuller, the music of his language is\r\nsimpler; with Heine the melody is, as it were, gorgeously orchestrated.\r\nIn Goethe's case there is nothing for the eye, not a single picture.\r\nIt is characteristic that his idea is the grander, Heine's the more\r\nmodern, more complex, just as Heine's metrical expression is more\r\nsensuously insinuating, produced by an art which devotes more attention\r\nto detail.\r\n\r\nNow take a picturesque, descriptive subject--the Three Kings of the\r\nEast, as they are called to mind at the Feast of the Epiphany. It is\r\ntreated in a broad, lively, popular, genuinely naïve manner in Goethe's\r\n_Epiphanias:_ \"Die heil'gen drei König' mit ihrem Stern\" (The Three\r\nKings of the East with their Star). The three kings, the white, the\r\nbrown, and the black, are described as they appeared when they went\r\nabout, dressed up, from house to house in the country; and the poem\r\nends:\r\n\r\n   \"Die heil'gen drei König' sind wohlgesinnt,\r\n    Sie suchen die Mutter und das Kind,\r\n    Der Joseph fromm sitzt auch dabei,\r\n    Der Ochs und Esel liegen auf Streu.\"[30]\r\n\r\n[30]\r\n\r\n    The Three Kings of the East with reverence lowly\r\n    Seek out the babe and mother holy,\r\n    Good Joseph's there too, and close by\r\n    The ox and ass on the litter lie.\r\n\r\nHeine does not view the legend in a more religious light than Goethe,\r\nbut he settles his features into a more serious expression, speaks more\r\nconcisely, draws with a sharper outline, obtains a totally different\r\neffect. Goethe rouses and cheers his readers by his broad and merry\r\nartlessness; Heine's words bore their way into men's minds and leave\r\ntheir sting there. He seems to aim at producing the same effect as that\r\nof an old Florentine painting:\r\n\r\n   \"Die heil'gen drei König' aus Morgenland,\r\n      Sie frugen in jedem Städtchen:\r\n    Wo geht der Weg nach Bethlehem,\r\n      Ihr lieben Buben und Mädchen?\r\n\r\n    Die Jungen und Alten, sie wussten es nicht,\r\n      Die Könige zogen weiter,\r\n    Sie folgten einem goldenen Stern,\r\n      Der leuchtete lieblich und heiter.\r\n\r\n    Der Stern blieb steh'n über Josephs Haus,\r\n      Da sind sie hineingegangen,\r\n    Das Oechslein brüllte, das Kindlein schrie,\r\n      Die heil'gen drei Könige sangen.\"[31]\r\n\r\n[31]\r\n\r\n    The three holy kings from the Eastern land\r\n      Inquired in every city:\r\n    Where is the road to Bethlehem,\r\n      Ye boys and maidens pretty?\r\n\r\n    The young and the old, they could not tell,\r\n      The kings went onward discreetly;\r\n    They followed the track of a golden star,\r\n      That sparkled brightly and sweetly.\r\n\r\n    The star stood still over Joseph's house\r\n      And they entered the dwelling lowly,\r\n    The oxen bellowed, the infant cried,\r\n      While sang the three kings holy.\r\n                      (BOWRING.)\r\n\r\nThere is a certain amount of waggery in this. What a concert! But also,\r\nwhat painting! The fewest words possible--not a stroke, not a touch too\r\nmuch, and the most telling, prompt effect.\r\n\r\nLet us now, in conclusion, think of one of those abstract figures\r\nwhich occur in all lyric poetry--more or less carefully wrought-out\r\npersonifications of an idea such as peace, happiness, unhappiness--and\r\nin this domain also compare Heine with Goethe. Here again it will be\r\nobserved that Goethe has the fuller note, Heine the firmer outline.\r\n\r\nGoethe wrote these lines to peace:\r\n\r\n   \"Der du von dem Himmel bist,\r\n    Alles Leid und Schmerzen stillest,\r\n    Den, der doppelt elend ist,\r\n    Doppelt mit Erquickung füllest,\r\n    Ach, ich bin des Treibens müde!\r\n    Was soll all der Schmerz, die Lust?\r\n         Süsser Friede!\r\n    Komm, ach komm in meine Brust!\"[32]\r\n\r\n32:\r\n\r\n    Child of heaven, that soothing calm\r\n      On every pain and sorrow pourest,\r\n    And a doubly healing balm\r\n      Find'st for him whose need is sorest,\r\n    Oh, I am of life aweary!\r\n      What availeth its unrest--\r\n    Pain that findeth no release,\r\n      Joy that at the best is dreary?\r\n           Gentle peace,\r\n    Come, oh come unto my breast!\r\n                   (Sir THEODORE MARTIN.)\r\n\r\nThere is no picture here, no real personification. There is a crescendo\r\nmovement through the first six lines, which culminates in the outburst:\r\n\"Süsser Friede!\"--though we could not feel quite certain that this\r\noutburst was coming.\r\n\r\nNow take Heine's personifications of fortune and misfortune, as\r\ncontained in the following verses:\r\n\r\n   \"Das Glück ist eine leichte Dirne\r\n      Und weilt nicht gern am selben Ort,\r\n    Sie streicht das Haar dir von der Stirne\r\n      Und küsst dich rasch und flattert fort.\r\n\r\n    Frau Unglück hat im Gegentheile\r\n      Dich liebefest an's Herz gedrückt,\r\n    Sie sagt, sie habe keine Eile,\r\n      Setzt sich zu dir an's Bett und strickt.\"[33]\r\n\r\n[33]\r\n\r\n    Oh, Joy, she is a lichtsome hizzy,\r\n       She winna bide wi' ye ava';\r\n     She strokes your broo an' maks ye dizzy\r\n       Wi' ae fond kiss, then flits awa'.\r\n\r\n     Dame Sorrow is a canty kimmer,\r\n       A fond embrace ye'll hae frae her;\r\n     She vows she's naewise thrang, the limmer,\r\n       Knits by your bed an' winna stir.\r\n                                       (W. A.)\r\n\r\nSeldom have two ideas been transformed into two living forms with\r\nso few strokes; and there is nothing much finer in all modern\r\nmyth-creation than the last two lines, between which are to be read the\r\nrecord of profound and terrible experience.\r\n\r\nHeine, as we have seen, makes his earliest appearance in the Romantic\r\nschool, and learns his trade from A. W. Schlegel, who imparts to him\r\nhis own correct taste. In the earliest period of his development he is\r\naddicted to Romantic ghost stories and Romantic archaisms. Then, in\r\nthe matter of metre, he begins to study and imitate Wilhelm Müller;\r\nin his most famous poem he borrows from Clemens Brentano. He soon\r\nforms his own style, the distinguishing feature of which is extreme\r\ncondensation of thought, feeling, and imagery. Heine makes everything\r\npresent and living, introduces even into tranquil themes a nervous,\r\nat times dæmonic, passion, not infrequently exaggerates until he\r\nbecomes grotesque, occasionally exchanges the light of day for the\r\nglaring brightness of electric light--a kind of un-naturalness which is\r\nnevertheless to be found in nature. His most effective poetic quality\r\nis pregnant brevity.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the blend of wit and imagination in his nature, he is\r\ninclined to produce his effects by contrasts, to seek for striking\r\ndisharmonies and incongruities; he has a special fancy for the effect\r\nproduced by letting a commonplace, vulgar reality imperceptibly\r\nmake way for a poetic vision, or allowing such a vision to fade and\r\nevaporate and give place to all too familiar reality.\r\n\r\nHis style is essentially modern--everything graphic, everything\r\nperspicuous. What is it that constitutes a great writer? The possession\r\nof the power to call forth mental visions or moods, visions by means\r\nof moods or moods by means of visions. It was especially the latter\r\nfaculty that Heine cultivated in himself; he never fails in the matter\r\nof clear outline and picturesque effect.\r\n\r\nAt his zenith he can no longer be compared with his teachers and\r\ncontemporaries. To gauge the power and versatility of his style it\r\nwas necessary to compare it with the greatest style of the age--with\r\nGoethe's. In the process he often, as we have seen, comes far short,\r\nbut it not so very seldom happens that he establishes his right to\r\nalmost equal admiration. It is, however, enough for him that it is\r\npossible, and now and again necessary, to compare him with Goethe.\r\n\r\nA style is the expression of a personality and a weapon in the\r\nwarfare of literature. Goethe's style, with all its greatness, is not\r\nsufficiently complex to grapple with modern ideas. But Heine's, that\r\nweapon which in its best days was as finely tempered as those old\r\nSpanish blades which could be bent like osiers, but which no armour\r\ncould snap, was better suited than any other to cope with modern life\r\nin its hardness and ugliness, its charm, its restlessness, and its\r\nwealth of glaring contrasts. It also possessed in the highest degree\r\nthe power of working upon the nerves of modern readers, who have more\r\ninclination for spiced dishes and heating beverages than for plain food\r\nand pure wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nHEINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that nothing has been more injurious to\r\nHeine's general reputation than his indiscreet loquacity on sexual\r\nsubjects. Whole groups of his poems are in ill repute on this account;\r\nthose, for instance, which compose the collection _Verschiedene_\r\n(Various), most of which have been unjustly condemned, although there\r\nare certainly some which are anything but sublime in their theme or\r\nrefined in their treatment of it. In _Der Gott und die Bajadere_ (\"The\r\nGod and the Bayadere\") Goethe had shown how even a very equivocal\r\nsubject can be ennobled by sublimity of style. And even when, as in\r\nthe Venetian epigrams, he treats of Bayaderes who are certainly not\r\npurified by love, and dwells upon the poet's relations with them, the\r\nantique metre in itself produces the effect of distance, and we are not\r\noffended by any objectionable word. These few epigrams, too, lie almost\r\nburied in the mass of Goethe's writings. Moreover, in reading them, we\r\nfeel that he is the man whom nature created in order that she might\r\nlearn from him what she is like in her entirety.\r\n\r\nWith Heine, communicativeness on the subject of his relations with\r\nthe other sex occupies too important a place, and is not always in\r\ngood taste. It gains him ten readers for one whom it alienates, but it\r\nsometimes happens that the one thus lost was worth more than the ten\r\ngained.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this frankness is, in a manner, his strength. It need not have\r\nbeen so personal, but it is quite indispensable in one who desires to\r\ncompass not only the tragic, but also the comic hemisphere. And in this\r\nquality, and in his many shameless personal attacks, he resembles the\r\ngreatest comic poet of all times.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of his _Winter's Tale_, immediately after the wanton\r\npassage in which he smells out the future of Germany by putting his\r\nhead down the opening of Charlemagne's night-throne, he declares that\r\nthe noblest of the Graces have tuned the strings of his lyre, and that\r\nthis lyre is the same which was sounded in days gone by, by his father,\r\n\"the late Aristophanes, the favourite of the Muses,\" He adds that in\r\nhis last chapter he has attempted to imitate _The Birds_, \"the best of\r\nfather's dramas.\"\r\n\r\nHe thus, we observe, prided himself on artistic descent from the\r\ngreatest comic poet of ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nFor a moment we are taken aback. Other German poets, such as Platen\r\nand Prutz, have imitated the form of the Aristophanic comedy, its\r\ntrimeters, choruses, parabases, the whole of that irregular and yet\r\nregular form of art built up by the Greek comic school; but Heine\r\nnever even made an attempt to master this poetical form, or any other.\r\nIt is characteristic of him that, persevering and conscientious as\r\nhe was in ensuring the telling precision of the single metrical or\r\nprose expression (I never saw a manuscript with so many corrections\r\nas that of his _Atta Troll_, in the Royal Library of Berlin), it was\r\nimpossible for him to submit to the artistic restriction of any of the\r\ngreat poetic forms. It tallies with this, that in his longer works the\r\nplan of the whole is quite vague, but every single line has been gone\r\nthrough again and again.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no exaggeration in saying that he never, in his\r\ncapacity as an artist, set himself a task and carried it out.\r\n\r\nOnce only he attempted to write a long, connected prose work, a romance\r\nor novel. Whether, as some maintain, the greater part of the manuscript\r\nwas destroyed by a fire, or whether, as I for one believe, the work was\r\nnever completed, the fact remains that all we have of it is a fragment.\r\nAnd even this fragment, _Der Rabbi von Bacharach,_ is, when carefully\r\nexamined, nothing but a very much antedated transcription of Heine's\r\nown private experiences.\r\n\r\nNor did he ever attempt a severely connected metrical composition. His\r\nonly long poems, _Atta Troll_ and _Deutschland, ein Wintermärchen_\r\n(\"Germany, a Winter's Tale\"), are irregular, whimsical fantasies,\r\nsoap-bubbles rocked upon cobweb tissue of the brain, only connected by\r\na uniformity of tone and design.\r\n\r\nThe idea of translating or adapting Aristophanes would never have\r\noccurred to Heine. He was not like Goethe, who, in spite of his\r\nenormous original productivity, condescended to translate and adapt\r\nfor his countrymen (Diderot, Benvenuto Cellini, Voltaire). When Goethe\r\nmade acquaintance with Aristophanes, he was enchanted with him, and\r\nit is Goethe, not Heine, who undertakes to transplant _The Birds_ on\r\nto German soil; but it is characteristic that in his hands the play\r\nundergoes a metamorphosis, is transformed from a political into a\r\nliterary satire. In Goethe's play the two discontented politicians\r\nhave become literary adventurers; in the owl (as proved by a letter\r\nfrom Jacobi to Heine) he satirises Klopstock, in the parrot, young\r\nCramer. It was in the epilogue to this adaptation that Goethe bestowed\r\non Aristophanes the immortal appellation, \"der ungezogene Liebling der\r\nGrazien\" (the froward favourite of the Graces), which suits Heine so\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nHeine was too lazy ever to have studied, translated, adapted, or\r\nimitated an ancient classic poet, but, supposing him to have done so,\r\nhe would never, like Goethe or Platen, have made pure literary comedies\r\nof the Aristophanic plays; it was the grand political satire that\r\nattracted him.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Heine is the wittiest man that ever lived, or at\r\nleast the wittiest man of modern times. Voltaire is, undoubtedly,\r\nlooked upon as a sort of personification of wit; but his wit is\r\nsensible and dry, not poetic and imaginative like Heine's.\r\n\r\nPlaten, the proud and stiff, acted unwisely when he wrote the work in\r\nwhich he satirises Heine, _Der romantische Oedipus_, in the outward\r\nform and style of the Aristophanic comedy, for he had nothing in\r\ncommon with Aristophanes but fine versification and coarse language.\r\nHeine, on the contrary, had all the chief qualities of Aristophanes\r\ncombined--wit, wanton wildness, imagination, lyric sweetness,\r\nshamelessness, and grace. Without grace and wit, shamelessness is\r\nundoubtedly a base and repellent quality. But in this combination with\r\nnoble qualities it is uncommon. The Aristophanic poet must not, cannot\r\nhave the pride which shrinks from amusing the coarse minded, who only\r\nunderstand a man when they meet him in the mire. He dares not shrink\r\nfrom debasing himself to a certain point, in order to gain a wider\r\nfield of vantage.\r\n\r\nIt is useless for an author to attempt, as Platen did, to impress his\r\nreaders before all else with the idea of his high-mindedness, and to\r\ninspire them with respect for his person; it is useless for him to\r\nproclaim that he intends \"to crush his antagonists with genuine wit.\"\r\nIt is not possible to appear at one and the same time in the character\r\nof a refined gentleman and an Aristophanic poet. A man is a failure\r\nin the latter rôle if he sets more value on the esteem of others\r\nthan on the triumph of art. The compensation in the case of the true\r\nAristophanic poet is, that his poetry has a compass unattainable by the\r\ndignified poets (a Schiller or a Hugo); it reflects the whole of human\r\nlife, from its highest functions to its lowest.\r\n\r\nThough there are so few formal points of contact between Heine's\r\nlyric-satiric poems and the great fantastic comedies of Aristophanes,\r\nit is nevertheless probable that since the days of ancient Greece there\r\nhas been no wit so nearly akin to the wit of Aristophanes as Heinrich\r\nHeine's.\r\n\r\nThis assertion is not based upon any misconception of the extraordinary\r\ndissimilarity in the character of their life-work. The Aristophanic\r\ncomedy with its grand and exact technical structure is the expression\r\nof the artistic culture of a whole nation, a monument that commemorates\r\nthe religious festivals of which it was the outcome. Aristophanes\r\nbuilt upon a foundation laid, a substructure prepared, by a whole line\r\nof distinguished predecessors, whose style was similar, whose talent\r\nwas akin to his, and to whose labours he succeeded, in much the same\r\nmanner as Shakespeare did to the work of his predecessors; hence the\r\nAristophanic comedy as a form of art is to a much greater extent a\r\ncollective production than Heine's stanza is. Quite apart from our\r\nknowledge of the fact that Eupolis and Kratinos accused Aristophanes\r\nof making inadmissible use of the ideas of his predecessors, we can\r\nsee for ourselves, from one of his own comedies, _The Knights_, that\r\nplays with titles like the Birds, the Wasps, the Frogs had already been\r\nproduced by the comic poet Magnes; the chorus disguised as reptiles,\r\ninsects, birds, was thus not a thing invented by Aristophanes, it was\r\nan inheritance. It is only because we are not acquainted with the\r\nGreek poet's predecessors that his life's work appears to us to be a\r\npurely individual production, the type of grand fantastic comedy, in\r\ncomparison with whose exuberance of life almost all modern comedy seems\r\nspiritless and weak.\r\n\r\nHis world is the topsy-turvy world. When, in the _Peace_, Trygaios\r\nsaddles a stinking carrion-beetle and on it, as his Pegasus, mounts\r\nthrough the clouds to the dwellings of the Gods, or when he drags\r\nPeace up by a fathom-long rope from the deep well into which she has\r\nbeen thrown by War, these proceedings are represented as if there were\r\nnothing in the least unusual or impossible about them; no explanation\r\nis offered; and we are compelled to believe in them. When, in _The\r\nBirds_, we hear two silly fellows, who are posing as philosophers,\r\ndisclose their crazy plans for building a city in the clouds, it all\r\nsounds very mad, and when we see the Birds receive these men with\r\nreverence, we do not conceive any higher opinion of their intelligence,\r\nwe are only struck by the comicality of the birds being so stupid as\r\nto put their trust in them. But when we hear that the city is actually\r\nbuilt, that fortune has attended the enterprise and that it has been\r\ncrowned with success, we feel that the world set before us here is not\r\nour own everyday world, but one with whose laws things are compatible\r\nwhich are contrary to the laws of ours.\r\n\r\nThis new world is purely fantastic, in so far as it is antagonistic to\r\nthe laws of probability and of nature. It is a world in which madness\r\ntriumphs, and the poet pretends that this is as it should be. Not till\r\nthe spectator begins to wonder _where_ this topsy-turvy world can\r\nbe, _where_ such things happen, _where_ political effrontery on such\r\na gigantic scale, far from being confounded and put to shame, wins\r\nconfidence and is rewarded--not till then is he led back to reality, to\r\nthe recognition in this world of his own world, his own home, Athens.\r\n\r\nThree of the Aristophanic comedies in our possession, _The Birds, The\r\nFrogs_, and _Peace_, do not pass, or pass only in part, on earth; they\r\nare meteoric or underground dramas. And it is in these only that Gods\r\nare represented, and then merely that they may be rated, ridiculed, or\r\nbeaten. In the world of reality they do not reveal themselves; for it\r\nis only in the world of fancy that they are believed in.\r\n\r\nHeine, the modern poet, dares not ask his readers to follow him into\r\nthe same sort of supernatural world; and yet he cannot dispense with\r\nthe supernatural; hence that constantly recurring use and abuse of\r\ndreams, for which hardly any parallel is to be found among other modern\r\npoets. Within the frame-work, as it were, of the dream, he dares to be\r\nextraordinary, to be Aristophanic.\r\n\r\nAs has been already remarked, he resembles Aristophanes in the depth of\r\nhis shamelessness and in the height of his lyric flight.\r\n\r\nAllusions to difficulties of digestion and the like, play a less\r\nimportant part in Heine's writings than in those of Aristophanes, who,\r\nhowever, we must remember, himself declared that he despised this\r\nkind of comicality. According to him its only recommendation was that\r\nit provoked the laughter of the least cultured part of the public.\r\nBut such things are frequently referred to by Heine too, at times in\r\nthe plainest of terms (notably in his attack on Platen), and with\r\nhim, almost as often as with Aristophanes, we have to be on our guard\r\nagainst certain noisome insects.\r\n\r\nHeine of course cannot allow himself the same freedom of speech in\r\nsexual matters as the old Greek did, but to make up for this, he\r\nnever hesitates to make an allusion that will atone for any want of\r\noutspokenness. And now and then there is almost no circumlocution; what\r\nas a general rule is indicated by a smile or a grimace is shouted to\r\nall and sundry with a loud guffaw, as, for instance, at the conclusion\r\nof _Deutschland_, and in such poems as _Der Ungläubige_ (\"The\r\nUnbeliever\").\r\n\r\nAnd yet again, as with Aristophanes, so with Heine; from this constant\r\ninsistence upon that in man which reminds us of his dwelling-place\r\nduring the earliest stages of his development, he rises to the purest,\r\nmost delicate lyric utterance. He, who so thoroughly comprehends the\r\nmaterial origin of all living things, in one of his poems derives them\r\nall from the song of the nightingale:\r\n\r\n   \"Im Anfang war die Nachtigall\r\n    Und sang ihr Lied: Zükükt! Zukükt!\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\n    In the beginning was the nightingale,\r\n    Who sang her song: Zükükt! Zükükt!\r\n                                 (CARY)\r\n\r\nWe cannot but be reminded of the beautiful lines in _The Birds_:\r\n\r\n   \"Gentlest and dearest, thou dost sing\r\n    Consorting still with mine thy lay,\r\n    Lov'd partner of my wild-wood way,\r\n    Thou'rt come, thou'rt come; all hail! all hail!\r\n    I see thee now, sweet nightingale.\"\r\n                                       (CARY)\r\n\r\nHeine, like Aristophanes, makes merry at the expense of the Gods. His\r\nsatire is naturally more cautious than the old Greek's; the modern\r\nworld does not stand jesting on this subject as well as the ancient\r\nworld did. In the works of Heine, who wrote under the censorship of the\r\npolice and of modern society, we have no counterpart to the scene in\r\n_The Frogs_, where Dionysus, the god of comedy, who has shown himself\r\nboth boastful and cowardly, gets one thrashing after another, and at\r\nlast appeals to his own priest, who occupied a place of honour among\r\nthe spectators, to help him in his extremity. And yet there is not\r\nvery much, from playful banter to broad jocularity and the most biting\r\nsarcasm, that Heine does not allow himself. Hyacinth's valuation of\r\nthe various religions (in the _Reisebilder_) is well known. He will\r\nhave nothing to say to Catholicism, which, with its pealing of bells,\r\nits incense fumes, and its \"Melancholik,\" is no religion for a citizen\r\nof Hamburg; he tests Protestantism by buying lottery tickets with the\r\nnumbers which he finds on the hymn-board in a Lutheran church; and he\r\ndisposes of Judaism in the well-known words: \"It is not a religion at\r\nall, but a misfortune.\" In the amusing and audacious verses entitled\r\n_Disputation_, a rabbi and a Capucin monk defend their respective\r\ndogmas; each, in offensive terms, boasts of the happiness conferred by\r\nhis doctrine; the royal bride who is to decide the dispute declares\r\nherself incapable of doing so, as the only thing she has noted is that\r\nthey both stink. In a passage in his book on Börne, Heine's mockery\r\nof religion becomes almost dramatic. He tells how, when he was living\r\non the island of Heligoland, he was often drawn into arguments with a\r\nPrussian Councillor of Justice on the subject of the Trinity. During\r\none of these discussions, the thinness of the flooring permitted them\r\nto hear distinctly what was being said in the room below, where a\r\nphlegmatic Dutchman was instructing their hostess how to distinguish\r\nbetween cod, haberdine, and stock-fish--which are in reality one and\r\nthe same fish, but with three names, denoting three different degrees\r\nof saltness.\r\n\r\nAs far as earthly potentates are concerned, Heine's comic assaults are\r\nnot less audacious, not less fantastic than those of Aristophanes.\r\nAristophanes showed courage in his attacks on Kleon and Theramenes;\r\nhe occasionally chanced to defend the good cause; but as a rule it\r\nwas the bad cause he upheld, for he made himself the spokesman of an\r\nindefensible conservatism, and of unjust personal animosities. Heine\r\nwas less frequently unjust or mean, and he was never conservative.\r\nBut he recalls Aristophanes to us by his aristocratic propensities,\r\nby the grim character of his personal attacks (those on Meyerbeer,\r\nfor instance), and also by the form of these attacks, for example the\r\namusing way in which he turns to account well-known, pathetic passages\r\nfrom other poets.\r\n\r\nHe made witty attacks on Frederick William IV., in _Deutschland_, where\r\nHammonia warns Heine himself against \"the king of Thule,\" and in the\r\npoem _Der neue Alexander_; and he wrote a whole series of satirical\r\npoems on King Ludwig of Bavaria and his doings. This latter king, whom\r\nHeine in past days had extolled, was flattered as a Mæcenas by a whole\r\nband of contemporary artists and poets. In the _Lobgesänge auf König\r\nLüdewig_, Heine falls foul of all his weaknesses, his gallery of beauty\r\nin the Munich palace, his bad verses, his annoyance when several of the\r\nfamous men of science and artists whom he patronised allowed themselves\r\nto be persuaded to leave Bavaria and settle in Prussia. On the subject\r\nof the gallery of beauty we have:\r\n\r\n   \"Er liebt die Kunst, und die schönsten Frau'n,\r\n    Die lässt er porträtiren,\r\n    Er geht in diesem gemalten Serail\r\n    Als Kunst-Eunuch spazieren.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[2]\r\n\r\n    In love with art, he collects fair dames\r\n    In counterfeit presentment,\r\n    And in this painted harem finds,\r\n    Art-eunuch-like, contentment.\r\n\r\nWhen writing of the migration to Prussia of the various men of note,\r\nHeine seizes the opportunity to give a side-hit at his old scape-goat,\r\nMassmann:\r\n\r\n   \"Der Schelling und der Cornelius,\r\n    Sie mögen von dannen wandern.\r\n    Dem einen erlosch im Kopf die Vernunft,\r\n    Die Phantasie dem Andern.\r\n\r\n    Doch dass man aus meiner Krone stahl\r\n    Die beste Perle, dass man\r\n    Mir meinen Turnkunstmeister geraubt,\r\n    Das Menschenjuwel, den Massmann,\r\n\r\n    Das hat mich gebeugt, das hat mich geknickt,\r\n    Das hat mir die Seele zerschmettert,\r\n    Mir fehlt jetzt der Mann, der in seiner Kunst\r\n    Den höchsten Pfahl erklettert....\"[3]\r\n\r\n[3]\r\n\r\n    That Schelling should go, and Cornelius too,\r\n    Without a tear I can see--\r\n    The one has lost his reasoning power,\r\n    The other all his fancy.\r\n\r\n    But to steal from my crown its brightest gem,\r\n    Its pearl of price, was cruel;\r\n    My master-gymnast they've filched away,\r\n    Massmann, mankind's chief jewel.\r\n\r\n    This crime has bent and broken me,\r\n    'Tis soul-destroying, cynical--\r\n    I have lost the man who had clambered up\r\n    To his art's supremest pinnacle.\r\n\r\nOf King Ludwig's essays in poetry he writes:\r\n\r\n   \"Herr Ludwig ist ein grosser Poet,\r\n    Und singt er, so stürzt Apollo\r\n    Vor ihm auf die Knie und bittet und fleht:\r\n    Halt ein! ich werde sonst toll, o!\"[4]\r\n\r\n[4]\r\n\r\n    King Ludwig is a poet great;\r\n    When he sings, the mighty Apollo\r\n    Falls on his knees and begs and prays:\r\n    O stop! or my death will follow!\r\n\r\nStill wittier is the parody of King Ludwig's poetical style, in the\r\ninscription above the resting-place of Atta Troll in the Bavarian\r\n_Walhalla_:\r\n\r\n   \"Atta Troll, Tendenzbär, sittlich--\r\n    Religiös; als Gatte brünstig;\r\n    Durch Verfuhrtsein von dem Zeitgeist\r\n    Waldursprünglich Sansculotte;\r\n\r\n    Sehr schlecht tanzend, doch Gesinnung\r\n    Tragend in der zott'gen Hochbrust\r\n    Manchmal auch gestunken habend;\r\n    Kein Talent, doch ein Charakter!\"[5]\r\n\r\n[5]\r\n\r\n    Atta Troll, a bear of impulse;\r\n    Devotee; a loving husband;\r\n    Full of sans-culottic notions,\r\n    Thanks to the prevailing fashion.\r\n    Wretched dancer; strong opinions\r\n    Bearing in his shaggy bosom;\r\n    Often stinking very badly;\r\n    Talentless, a character!\r\n                        (BOWRING)\r\n\r\nThe harshness and the strained participial construction both remind us\r\nof the style of the royal effusions which any visitor to Munich may\r\nstudy for himself below the frescoes on the walls of the arcades.\r\n\r\nThis is merely personal satire of crowned heads; but Heine's satire,\r\nlike that of Aristophanes, is frequently directed against existing\r\npolitical, social, and literary conditions, and it is then that he is\r\nobliged to call the dream to his aid. With its help he descends into\r\nthe depth of the earth, or mounts to a fantastic world above the clouds.\r\n\r\nThis, as already mentioned, happens more especially in _Deutschland_.\r\nObserve with what care and skill Heine prepares for the fantastic\r\ndescription of Barbarossa's subterranean dwelling-place in the\r\nKyffhäuser. First he introduces the refrain of an old legendary ballad:\r\n\"Sonne, du klagende Flamme!\" (Sun, thou accusing flame!) with a sketch\r\nof the legend which tells how the sun acted as the accuser of the\r\nmurderer of a young maiden; then he describes the good old nurse who\r\nsang this ballad and told many an entrancing tale--the tale of the\r\nprincess disguised as a goose-herd, the tale of the emperor who lived\r\ndeep down in the earth below the mountain; this second he relates at\r\nlength--and presently all else is forgotten; we see Barbarossa with\r\nhis mail-clad followers, we hear him call them to horse, to arms,\r\nto battle, to avenge the wrong which the murderers have done to the\r\ngolden-haired Germania. Then we return to the mood of the nursery\r\nballad, and to its refrain: \"Sonne! du klagende Flamme!\" now chanted\r\nwith enthusiasm and rejoicing. There is an Aristophanic _verve_\r\nin this poetic description of the old arsenal, the empty suits of\r\narmour, the faded flags, the sleeping soldiers, and then the sudden\r\nrevulsion, the appeal to awakening power, the supplication that the\r\nMiddle Ages may return again, as being infinitely preferable to the\r\nsanctimonious Prussia of the day, with her mixture of Gothic folly and\r\nmodern falsehood. The two following cantos, which contain a further\r\ndescription of the interior of the mountain, and conversations with\r\nBarbarossa, take the form of an account of a dream which the poet had\r\nwhile travelling at night in the stage-coach.\r\n\r\nThe anti-Prussian rhapsody in the inn at Minden is prepared for in the\r\nsame manner. Heine wants to summon forth the Prussian eagle, and to\r\npluck him and shoot him. If Aristophanes had had the same designs, he\r\nwould have introduced the eagle without more ado. Heine goes to work in\r\nhis roundabout way. In the act of falling asleep he dreams that the red\r\nbed-curtain tassel above his head turns into an eagle with feathers and\r\nclaws, which threatens to tear the liver out of his breast, and which\r\nhe taunts with bitter hatred.\r\n\r\nIn a few single instances Heine's artistic procedure is bolder, more\r\nlike that of the great Greek. One of these is the splendid harangue to\r\nthe wolves at night in the Teutoburgerwald. At midnight the traveller\r\nhears them howling round his carriage, which has lost a wheel. He comes\r\nout and makes a speech to the savage brutes:\r\n\r\n   \"Mitwölfe, ich bin glücklich, heut'\r\n      In eurer Mitte zu weilen,\r\n    Wo so viel' edle Gemüther mir\r\n      Mit Liebe entgegen heulen.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[6]\r\n\r\n    Brother wolves! it gives me great pleasure to-day\r\n      To tarry awhile midst your growling,\r\n    Where so many noble spirits have met,\r\n      Around me lovingly howling.\r\n                                         (BOWRING)\r\n\r\nAnd the speech is a humorous imitation of those which great men are\r\nin the habit of making on such occasions: This is an hour which to\r\nhim will be ever memorable. They lie who say that he has joined the\r\ndogs; the idea of becoming court-councillor to the lambs has never\r\neven occurred to him. From time to time he has dressed himself in a\r\nsheepskin, but only for the sake of the warmth; he is and always will\r\nbe a wolf.\r\n\r\nIn the scene between the poet and the strapping woman with the mural\r\ncrown who represents Hamburg, we have, as Heine himself informs us, a\r\ndirect imitation of the wedding of Peithetaerus and Basileia in _The\r\nBirds_. It is wanton and boyishly frolicsome; its licentiousness is\r\nreally more offensive than that of similar passages in Aristophanes,\r\nwho never appears in his own plays except in defence of himself as a\r\npoet. Heine does not go the same length as Aristophanes, but he is more\r\npersonal.\r\n\r\nIn _Atta Troll_ the parallel between the two poets is still more\r\nobvious. Here Heine's imagination has freer play, because the hero\r\nis not a man, but a bear. There is fine fancy in the passage where\r\nthe bear, after his flight, is described dancing for his cubs in the\r\nmoonlight. There is inimitable humour in his declamation against the\r\nrights of man, and in his boast of the more ancient rights of bears,\r\nwhich recalls the charming parabasis in _The Birds_, in which it is\r\nestablished that the bird world is the oldest: Everything proceeds from\r\nthe original egg, the egg of Night, Love first of all, and the birds\r\nare children of Love. Atta Troll's pride in the animal world is most\r\namusing, especially so because Heine manages to insinuate into the\r\nbear's utterances sarcastic hits at persons whom he himself wishes to\r\ndepreciate--Freiligrath, for instance, whose popular but foolish poem,\r\n_Löwenritt_, and infelicitous _Mohrenkönig_ had roused his mirthful\r\nderision:\r\n\r\n   \"Giebt es nicht gelehrte Hunde?\r\n    Und auch Pferde, welche rechnen?\r\n      . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n    Schreiben Esel nicht Kritiken?\r\n    Spielen Affen nicht Komödie?\r\n      . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n    Singen nicht die Nachtigallen?\r\n    Ist der Freiligrath kein Dichter?\r\n    Wer besäng' den Löwen besser?\r\n    Als sein Landsmann, das Kamel?\"[7]\r\n\r\n7:\r\n\r\n    Are there not such things as learned\r\n    Dogs, and horses too, who reckon?\r\n      .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n    Write not asses criticisms?\r\n    Are not apes all good comedians?\r\n      .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n    Are not nightingales good singers?\r\n    And is Freiligrath no poet?\r\n    Who can sing of lions better\r\n    Than their countryman, the camel?[*]\r\n                               (BOWRING)\r\n\r\n[*]In German slang \"camel\" is equivalent to \"blockhead.\"\r\n\r\nA good deal of what the bear says, sounds like satire on foolish\r\ncommunistic democracy. He holds forth volubly against property--bears\r\nare born without pockets, but men have pockets and stuff them; and\r\ndiscourses eagerly on equality:\r\n\r\n   \"Strenge Gleichheit! Jeder Esel\r\n    Sei befugt zum höchsten Staatsamt,\r\n    Und der Löwe soll dagegen\r\n    Mit dem Sack zur Mühle traben.\"[8]\r\n\r\n[8]\r\n\r\n    Strict equality! Each donkey\r\n    Be entitled to high office;\r\n    On the other hand, the lion\r\n    Carry to the mill the sack.\r\n                      (BOWRING)\r\n\r\nBut on the whole it is harmless, stingless satire, fantastical\r\nbanter alike of the clerical party and communists, misanthropes and\r\nrevolutionists, cosmopolitans and patriots--for the bear speaks like\r\nthem all in turn. A very wonderful passage is Atta Troll's sermon\r\nagainst atheism and its development from his deism, the passage\r\nbeginning:\r\n\r\n   \"Hüte dich vor Menschendenkart,\r\n    Sie verdirbt dir Leib und Seele;\r\n    Unter allen Menschen giebt es\r\n    Keinen ordentlichen Menschen.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[9]\r\n\r\n    Guard against man's ways of thinking,\r\n    They destroy both soul and body;\r\n    'Mongst all men there's no such thing as\r\n    Any good and decent man.\r\n                                  (BOWRING)\r\n\r\nThere is a gay profundity in the warning against Feuerbach and Bauer,\r\nand there is wit, as brilliant as Voltaire's, but richer, and warmer,\r\nin the description of the creative deity:\r\n\r\n   \"Droben in dem Sternenzelte,\r\n    Auf dem gold'nen Herrscherstuhle,\r\n    Weltregierend, majestätisch,\r\n    Sitzt ein kolossaler Eisbär\" &c.[10]\r\n\r\n[10]\r\n\r\n    In yon starry bright pavilion,\r\n    On the golden seat of power,\r\n    World-directing and majestic,\r\n    Sits a mighty polar-bear.\r\n                         (BOWRING)\r\n\r\nWhat humour there is in the description of the bear-saints who dance\r\nbefore his throne!\r\n\r\nThe bear gives us something of the phraseology of all the different\r\nparties in turn, but it is the bigoted Teuton that he chiefly favours;\r\nit is he who is most severely satirised. The sleek bear-damsels remind\r\nus of a German pastor's daughters; the youngest cub turns somersaults\r\nexactly like Massmann, and is, like him, the product of home education,\r\nhas never been able to learn Greek or Latin, or any language but his\r\nmother-tongue.\r\n\r\nBy strange, fantastic detours Heine invariably brings his reader back\r\nto the realities of his native land.\r\n\r\nAristophanic, in this respect, is the passage in which, when it\r\nrains, the cry is heard: \"Six-and-thirty kings for an umbrella!\" and\r\nagain, when shelter is reached: \"Six-and-thirty kings for a warm\r\ndressing-gown!\"\r\n\r\nAnd absolutely Aristophanic is the suppressed passage, in which the\r\nbird Hut-Hut tells how Solomon and Balkis ask each other riddles in the\r\nrealm of shades, riddles like:\r\n\r\n   \"Wer ist wohl der grösste Lump\r\n    Unter allen deutschen Lumpen;\r\n    Die in allen sechs und dreissig\r\n    Deutschen Bundesstaaten leben?\"[11]\r\n\r\n[11]\r\n\r\n    Who, think you, is the paltriest wight\r\n    Amongst the crowd of worthless fellows\r\n    In all the different States of Germany,\r\n    Which are in number six-and-thirty?\r\n\r\nBalkis, to whom the question is put, sends secret messengers to make\r\ninquiry in every country and state in Germany, but each time she\r\ninforms Solomon of the discovery of a specially contemptible wretch, he\r\nanswers:\r\n\r\n   \"Kind! es giebt noch einen grösser'n!\r\n    (Child! there is a worse one still!)\r\n\r\nAnd it is explained to us as a peculiarity of Germany, that as often as\r\nwe imagine we have discovered her most despicable character, one still\r\nmore despicable makes his appearance. There is no progress so certain\r\nas the progress in general contemptibility. It was only yesterday that\r\nX. appeared to be the sorriest knave, to-day he is not to be named\r\nin comparison with N. N. Heine must have felt that he had plentiful\r\nstores of invention to draw upon, else he would hardly, in his final\r\nrevision of the poem, have rejected this means of satirising his\r\nopponents, one by one, in the most amusing manner.\r\n\r\nIn purely literary satire, too, Heine's methods have a distinct\r\nresemblance to those of Aristophanes. An example of this is the hit in\r\n_Atta Troll_ at the Swabian school of poets--the cat in the witch's\r\ncottage, which is a bewitched Swabian poet, who will turn into a man\r\nagain when a pure maiden can read Gustav Pfizer's poems on New Year's\r\neve without falling asleep. Another example is the satire in the same\r\npoem on the following rather ridiculous lines of Freiligrath's _Der\r\nMohrenfürst_ (The Moorish Prince) with their far-fetched simile:\r\n\r\n   \"Aus dem schimmernd weissen Zelte hervor\r\n    Tritt der schlachtgerüstete fürstliche Mohr;\r\n    So tritt aus schimmernder Wolken Thor\r\n    Der Mond, der verfinsterte, dunkle, hervor.\"[12]\r\n\r\n[12] From the glistening white tent the royal Moor issues forth, armed\r\nfor the fray; even as the moon, gloomy and dark, issues from the\r\nglistening gate-way of the clouds.\r\n\r\nIt is a poem about a negro king, who is taken prisoner, brought to\r\nEurope, and made to play the drum outside a circus; while doing so\r\nhe thinks of his former greatness, and beats his drum to pieces. The\r\nidea of the black man at the opening of the tent resembling the moon\r\nappearing through the clouds is undoubtedly comical.\r\n\r\nIn _Atta Troll_ the red tongue hangs out of the bear's black jaws\r\nas the moon shows herself through white clouds. And towards the end\r\nof the poem Heine tells us how, in the Jardin des Plantes, he makes\r\nacquaintance with a negro caretaker, who confides to him that he is\r\nFreiligrath's negro king, that he has married a white Alsatian cook,\r\nwhose feet remind him of the feet of the elephants in his native land,\r\nand whose French sounds to him like the negro tongue. She feeds him so\r\nwell that he has developed a little round black stomach, which shows\r\nitself through the opening of his shirt like a black moon, appearing\r\nfrom behind white clouds.\r\n\r\nAnd there is something especially Aristophanic in the recklessly brutal\r\nsatire upon Platen in the second part of the _Reisebilder_. Certain\r\namusing artifices in their literary warfare are common to the Greek\r\nand the German comic poet. In _The Frogs_, in the contest between\r\nÆschylus and Euripides (a poet whom Aristophanes hates), Æschylus\r\ntacks a refrain, equivalent to \"spoiled his verse,\" to everything that\r\nEuripides recites. In the _Reisebilder_ Heine revenges himself by\r\nmaking Hyacinth alternately tack the words _von vorn_ (from the front)\r\nand _von hinten_ (from behind) to the end of Platen's lines, thereby\r\nmaliciously perverting their meaning.\r\n\r\nThe Aristophanic comedy resembles the majestic frescoes that cover\r\nthe interior of some great dome; to compare Heine's comic writings\r\nwith those of Aristophanes, is to compare pictures carefully painted\r\non the easel with such frescoes. In the Greek comedies there is the\r\nlight and space of the Sistine Chapel; in them, as in the frescoes of\r\nMichael Angelo, everything is large, sweeping, strong; the creation\r\nof a mind that sets recognised rules at defiance by the vehemence of\r\nits lyric emotion, the audacity of its fore-shortening, and the force\r\nof its allegory. Only that Michael Angelo's world is solemnly, wildly\r\ntragic, whereas the world of Aristophanes is dithyrambic, a world of\r\ncaricatures set in a framework of Greek social conditions.\r\n\r\nCompared with Aristophanes, Heine is a private, stay-at-home citizen.\r\nAristophanes holds forth to an audience of thousands in the broad\r\ndaylight of the theatre; Heine communes with his public sitting alone\r\nin his room. But the scenes that depict themselves simply on the retina\r\nof his eye, are aglow with more ardent, passionate life than those\r\nwhich Aristophanes embodied on the stage. And his aims are not the\r\npurely local aims of the Greek poet. When he is at his best, he appeals\r\nto millions who are not of his nationality, appeals, indeed, to the\r\nelect among all who can read. His lyric poetry is more personal, more\r\nintense, more nervous than that of any Greek; his satire is dedicated\r\nto the cause of general ideas, which did not exist for Aristophanes. He\r\nis not less witty than his Greek forerunner, and he always fought for\r\npolitical progress and personal liberty, whereas the enemy of Euripides\r\nand Socrates most frequently fought for a past that was gone beyond\r\nrecall, a past to which he himself most certainly did not belong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nHEINE\r\n\r\n\r\nHeine's prose is not on the same level with his verse. In his most\r\nfamous prose book, the _Reisebilder_, he shows himself to be a pupil of\r\nSterne; in later works, where he has attained to greater independence,\r\nhe is always witty and lively, but seldom properly qualified to treat\r\nthe subjects of his choice. Whether he is writing on German philosophy\r\nfor French readers, or on French art for Germans, he does it in equally\r\ndilettante fashion. Judged as journalism, his writing was always\r\nexcellent, but he is too strong, too great a man to be classified as a\r\njournalist.\r\n\r\nToo much has been made of Heine's superficiality by the pedants among\r\nhis detractors. He was not a hard worker, but he was by no means idle,\r\nand he possessed a fund of solid and varied knowledge. Still, it is\r\nonly as a poet that he is great; most of his prose writings treat of\r\nthe passing topics of the day; and his fame has been actually injured\r\nby the publication of his letters, which, as a rule, present him to\r\nus in an unfavourable light, namely entirely taken up with his own\r\ninterests. Pecuniary difficulties are a tiresome subject, even when\r\nthey happen to be the pecuniary difficulties of a genius.\r\n\r\nHeine, as every one knows, did not live to be an old man. He was\r\ncarried off in the prime of his mental powers by a terrible disease.\r\n\r\nHe had always been delicate and suffering; in his youth he was plagued\r\nby severe headaches, and was obliged to be so moderate in the matter\r\nof drink that his friends used laughingly to declare that he contented\r\nhimself with _smelling_ a bottle of Rhenish wine which he kept in his\r\nroom. His nervous system was undermined while he was still a young\r\nman, but it is certain that this was to a much less extent the result\r\nof excesses than is generally believed, for Heine is a real _fanfaron\r\ndes vices_, given to perpetual boasting of his own depravity. He was\r\nattacked by the disease which is so frequently the fate of those who\r\nhave lived lives of unbroken mental productivity. An affection of the\r\nspine, with paralysis first of the eyelids and in course of time of\r\nalmost the whole body, consigned him to that \"mattress-grave\" in Paris,\r\nwhere he lay for nearly eight years.\r\n\r\nHis life, which can neither be called a great nor a happy one, falls\r\nof itself into two distinctly defined parts--the life in Germany till\r\nthe Revolution of July, and the life in Paris from 1831 till his\r\ndeath in 1856. It was a life led without calculation, but not without\r\ninstinctive perception of the direction in which possibilities of\r\ndevelopment for his talent lay; it is hardly probable that Heine would\r\nhave attained to his great cosmopolitan fame, or even that he would\r\nhave become so eminent a satiric poet, if he had lived in his native\r\ncountry all his life.\r\n\r\nHis youthful years in Germany are passed under the oppression of the\r\nreaction--his _Reisebilder_ won popularity as an expression of the\r\ngeneral political dissatisfaction--but he soon makes up his mind that\r\nit is useless to meddle with politics. The Revolution of July puts\r\nnew life into everything; Heine goes off to Paris, settles there,\r\nand is kept there by the embargo placed upon his works in all the\r\nstates of the German Confederation. The Guizot Government secretly\r\ngive him the small pension which enables him to live in comparative\r\ncomfort. His acceptance of this laid him open to accusations, which,\r\nthough they were not altogether groundless, were in many points quite\r\nunjustifiable. It must be borne in mind that Heine did not understand\r\nthe art of making money; and even if he had, it would have been of\r\nlittle use to him. Many thousands of pounds must have been made by the\r\nsale of his books, but he himself made over the most profitable of\r\nthem all, the _Buch der Lieder_, to Campe in payment of an old debt of\r\n50 Louis d'ors, and was all his life long dependent on the unwilling\r\nassistance of his rich uncle. If he, and if the little Parisian\r\ngrisette whom he married, had had more idea of economy, it might have\r\nbeen unnecessary for him to accept Government support. The fact of his\r\naccepting it no doubt occasionally prevented him from criticising the\r\nFrench ministry freely in German newspapers, but it had no other bad\r\nresult, and least of all did it induce him to write anything he did not\r\nmean.\r\n\r\nFrom French soil he waged uninterrupted, unremitting intellectual\r\nwarfare with the European reaction. In this respect he may be called\r\nByron's great successor. Only a few years after the sword of sarcasm,\r\nwielded in the cause of liberty, had slipped from the hands of the\r\ndying Byron, it was seized by Heine, who wielded it for a whole\r\ngeneration with equal skill and power. Yet for the eight last years it\r\nwas a mortally wounded man who fought.\r\n\r\nAt no time did he write truer, more incisive, more brilliant verse\r\nthan when he lay nailed to the low, broad bed of torture in Paris. And\r\nnever, so far as we know, has a great productive mind borne superhuman\r\nsufferings with more undaunted courage and endurance. The power of\r\nthe soul over the body has seldom displayed itself so unmistakably.\r\nTo bear such agonies as his in close-lipped silence would have been\r\nadmirable; but to create, to bubble over with sparkling, whimsical jest\r\nand mockery, to let his spirit wander the world round in charming and\r\nprofound reverie, while he himself lay crippled, almost lifeless, on\r\nhis couch--this was great.\r\n\r\nHe lay there shrunk to a skeleton, with his eyes closed, his hands\r\nalmost powerless, his noble features painfully emaciated; the white,\r\nperfectly formed hands were nearly transparent; at times, when he\r\nspoke, a Mephistophelian smile passed over the suffering, martyr-like\r\nface. At last, as in the case of Tithonus of old, all that really\r\nremained of the man was his voice; but it was a voice of many notes, of\r\nmany whimsies, many jests.\r\n\r\nHe continued to be mentally active. It was as if the driving-wheel went\r\non turning without steam, as if the lamp went on burning without oil.\r\n\r\nIt is not true that he reverted to a connection with any church; but\r\nthe suffering man clung to a kind of piety and faith in God which was a\r\nlegacy from the days of his youth. At this faith he himself sometimes\r\nsmiled. We have such a smile in the words with which on the last day\r\nof his life he tried to pacify an excited acquaintance: _Dieu me\r\npardonnera--c'est son métier._\r\n\r\nIt is a touching proof of his strength of mind and of his filial\r\naffection that during his whole long illness he took the greatest care\r\nthat all knowledge of his sufferings should be kept from his old mother\r\nin Hamburg; to the last he wrote her cheerful, amusing letters, and he\r\ncaused any passages that might have awakened her suspicions to be taken\r\nout of the copies of his works that were sent to her.\r\n\r\nAnother pleasant impression of his spiritual condition is conveyed by\r\nthe circumstance that he, the most wanton-tongued of men and poets on\r\nthe subject of love, changed during his illness into the tenderest and\r\nmost spiritual exponent of that passion. The last year of his life was,\r\nas is well known, sweetened by the admiration and devotion of the young\r\nand beautiful woman who, though German born, made her appearance as\r\na French authoress under the pseudonym of Camille Selden.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Meissner: _Erinnerungen an Heinrich Heine_. Camille Selden: _Les\r\nderniers jours de Henri Heine_, 1884.\r\n\r\nShe was then about twenty-eight, blue-eyed, fair-haired, and so\r\ncharming, gentle, and attractive, that she won Heine's heart the first\r\ntime she visited him. Soon he could not live without her; he was\r\nmiserable if a few days passed without his seeing her, though he was\r\noften in such pain that he was obliged to request her to delay her\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nIt is in the poems and letters to her, published after Heine's death,\r\nthat we find that fervency, depth, and fulness of passion which we feel\r\nto be wanting in the rest of his love poetry.\r\n\r\nHe calls her his spiritually affianced bride, whose life is bound\r\nup with his by the will of fate. United, they would have known what\r\nhappiness is; separated, they are doomed to misery:\r\n\r\n   \"Ich weiss es jetzt. Bei Gott! du bist es,\r\n    Die ich geliebt. Wie bitter ist es,\r\n    Wenn im Momente des Erkennens\r\n    Die Stunde schlägt des ew'gen Trennens!\r\n    Der Willkomm ist zu gleicher Zeit\r\n    Ein Lebewohl!\"[2]\r\n\r\n[2]\r\n\r\n    I know it now. By heaven! 'tis thou\r\n    Whom I have loved. How bitter now,\r\n    The moment we are joined for ever,\r\n    To find the hour when we must sever!\r\n    The welcome must at once give way\r\n    To sad farewell!\r\n                             (BOWRING)\r\n\r\nHalf laughing, half weeping, he bemoans the compulsory platonic\r\naffection of two lovers, to whom an embrace is an impossibility:\r\n\r\n   \"Worte! Worte! keine Thaten!\r\n      Niemals Fleisch, geliebte Puppe,\r\n    Immer Geist und keinen Braten,\r\n      Keine Knödel in der Suppe!\"[3]\r\n\r\n[3]\r\n\r\n    Words, empty words, and never deeds!\r\n      No roast for us, my puppet sweet,\r\n    Not even dumplings in the soup;\r\n      A feast of mind, but not of meat!\r\n\r\nWhen, at a rare time, she keeps him waiting, he is frantic with\r\nimpatience:\r\n\r\n   \"Lass mich mit glüh'nden Zangen kneipen,\r\n      Lass grausam schinden mein Gesicht,\r\n    Lass mich mit Ruthen peitschen, stäupen--\r\n      Nur warten, warten lass mich nicht!\"[4]\r\n\r\n[4]\r\n\r\n    With red-hot irons scar my flesh,\r\n      Pinch me with pincers glowing hot,\r\n    Or have me heat with many stripes--\r\n      But oh! to wait compel me not!\r\n\r\nBut the great mystic poem which celebrates the nuptials of the dead\r\npoet with the passion-flower that blossoms on his grave, is a poem of\r\nresignation, resignation in the presence of Death:\r\n\r\n   \"Du warst die Blume, du geliebtes Kind,\r\n    An deinen Küssen musst' ich dich erkennen.\r\n    So zärtlich keine Blumenlippen sind,\r\n    So feurig keine Blumenthränen brennen.\r\n\r\n    Geschlossen war mein Aug', doch angeblickt\r\n    Hat meine Seel' beständig dein Gesichte,\r\n    Du sahst mich an, beseeligt und verzückt\r\n    Und geisterhaft beglänzt vom Mondenlichte.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[5] Thou wast that flower, beloved! I knew thee by thy kisses; no\r\nflower lips kiss so tenderly, no flower tears burn so scorchingly. My\r\neyes were fast closed, but my soul gazed steadfastly upon thy face; and\r\nin the moonlight's ghostly sheen, blissful and trembling, thou did'st\r\nreturn my gaze.\r\n\r\nThese images, these feelings, belong to an insubstantial world, a world\r\nlike the blind man's, where there are kisses, but not from visible\r\nlips, and tears which fall from unseen eyes, a world fragrant with the\r\nperfume of flowers that cannot be touched, and illuminated by magic,\r\nspirit-like moonshine instead of the light of the sun. There is no\r\nsubstantiality and there is no sound:\r\n\r\n   \"Wir sprachen nicht, jedoch mein Herz vernahm\r\n    Was du verschwiegen dachtest im Gemüthe--\r\n    Das ausgesprochene Wort ist ohne Scham,\r\n    Das Schweigen ist der Liebe keusche Blüthe.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[6] We said not a word, but my heart felt all thy unspoken\r\nthoughts--the spoken word is a shameless thing, silence is love's\r\nchaste blossom.\r\n\r\nThey held noiseless converse, but what they talked of we are forbidden\r\nto ask:\r\n\r\n   \"Frag, was er strahlet, den Karfunkelstein,\r\n    Frag, was sie duften, Nachtviol' und Rosen--\r\n    Doch frage nie, wovon im Mondenschein\r\n    Die Marterblume und ihr Todter kosen!\"[7]\r\n\r\n[7] Ask the ruby to explain its fiery glow, ask violet and rose\r\nto analyse their perfume, but never seek to know of what the\r\npassion-flower and her dead lover talk so caressingly in the pale\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\nHeine rises here to a level with Shelley, the sublimest of modern lyric\r\npoets. This is Shelley's note--the violin strain of an Ariel, clear and\r\nspirit-like and full, and entirely modern in its trembling, thrilling,\r\nalmost morbid tenderness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE AND PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\nBörne and many later critics have maintained that Heine was never in\r\nearnest about anything, and have condemned him accordingly. Setting\r\naside slighter and unimportant causes, Börne's resentment was really\r\naroused by what appeared to him to be Heine's determination not to\r\nespouse the cause of any party. He himself, as far as it was possible\r\nin those unparliamentary days, was an extreme partyman in literature.\r\n\r\nIt is now a generally accepted, trite axiom, that art is its own\r\naim and end, but then people were accustomed to look upon it as the\r\nhandmaid of the great general aims of the day; and in all German\r\nliterary productions of that period, important and unimportant, we feel\r\nexactly what it was that induced the writer to take up his pen. Even an\r\nauthor as strongly actuated by a purpose as Heine was, did not satisfy\r\nthose who, like Börne, lived for their convictions. They applied to him\r\nthe expression \"talented but characterless\" (\"wohl ein Talent, aber\r\nkein Charakter\"), which he ridicules so unmercifully in _Atta Troll_.\r\nEven in the introduction he alludes jestingly to the consolation for\r\nthe great majority which is contained in the doctrine that respectable\r\npeople are as a rule bad musicians, while, to make up for this, good\r\nmusicians are anything but respectable people--and every one knows that\r\nrespectability and not music is the important thing in this world.\r\n\r\nElsewhere Heine maintains that it is, as a rule, a sign of a man's\r\nnarrowmindedness when he is straightway discerned and held in high\r\nesteem by the narrow-minded majority as a man of character; the chief\r\nreason for such distinction being that a narrow, superficial, but\r\nalways consistent philosophy of life is what the multitude most easily\r\nunderstands.\r\n\r\nStoic firmness was assuredly not one of the qualities of Heine's\r\nnature. Allowing that in certain given circumstances he showed want of\r\ncharacter, we proceed to what is really the vital question: Ought the\r\npoet to be a party-man?\r\n\r\nAt the time when Heine was jeering in _Atta Troll_ at those who in\r\ntheir philanthropic and political ardour imagined strength of character\r\nto be a sufficient substitute for talent, a serious literary war\r\nwas being waged in Germany over the question whether the poet ought\r\nto be a party-man or to take up a position superior to all parties.\r\n_Atta Troll_, which pours such ridicule on Freiligrath's youthful\r\npoems, appeared in the autumn of 1841; in November of the same year\r\nFreiligrath, who till then had been best known by oriental poems in\r\nVictor Hugo's style, and who had a short time previously accepted\r\na pension from the King of Prussia, wrote, in a poem entitled _Año\r\nSpanien_ (on Diego Leon, the Spanish general shot in 1841) the\r\nfollowing lines on the poet as such:\r\n\r\n   \"Er beugt sein Knie dem Helden Bonaparte,\r\n    Und hört mit Zürnen d'Enghien's Todesschrei:\r\n    Der Dichter steht auf einer höhern Warte\r\n    Als auf den Zinnen der Partei.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThis sentiment was condemned by Georg Herwegh in the poem _Die Partei\r\n(an Ferdinand Freiligrath_), the most striking lines of which are:\r\n\r\n   \"Partei! Partei! wer sollte sie nicht nehmen,\r\n    Die noch die Mutter aller Siege war!\r\n    Wie mag ein Dichter solch ein Wort verfehmen,\r\n    Ein Wort, das alles Herrliche gebar!\r\n    Nur offen wie ein Mann: Für oder wider?\r\n    Und die Parole: Sklave oder frei?\r\n    Selbst Götter stiegen vom Olymp hernieder\r\n    Und kämpften auf den Zinnen der Partei.\"[2]\r\n\r\nA year later, in his poem _Duett der Pensionirten_, Herwegh taunted\r\nFreiligrath with accepting a pension from the King of Prussia,\r\nwhereupon Freiligrath, as is well known, threw up his pension, joined\r\nthe ranks of the political poets, and developed so rapidly into a\r\nRadical and revolutionary, that at the time of the outbreak in 1848, he\r\nwas looked upon as the representative revolutionary poet in Germany. It\r\nis plain, then, that Freiligrath considered Herwegh to be in the right.\r\nStill this does not prove him to have been so.\r\n\r\nThe question whether and to what extent the poet ought to be a\r\nparty-man is a very complex one. It is so in the first instance because\r\nof the ambiguity of the word party, a word which Heine and Börne,\r\nFreiligrath and Herwegh employed with a different meaning at different\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe poet, even if he is a small-minded man, can only lose by pinning\r\nhis faith to any narrow, political, party programme, to any social or\r\nreligious theory. How is it possible that his ideals should exactly\r\ncorrespond with the limited, definite aims of any party! Thomas Moore\r\nwas a Whig poet, Walter Scott a Tory poet, because, with all their\r\ngreat talent, they were not great minds. Byron went more to the\r\nroot of things than either of them, or than either of the political\r\nparties--yet every one instinctively feels that it is absurd to say\r\nthat Byron, as a poet, did not take a side in politics or religion. He\r\ndid so even more markedly than Schiller, who also could not be said to\r\nbelong to any political party, for one reason because there were none\r\nin the Germany of his day.\r\n\r\nThere are certain branches of literature which plainly have nothing\r\nto do with party. The poet of love, as such, belongs to no political\r\nor religious party; though it is not impossible that he may belong to\r\nan art party, for as soon as there is any question of style in art,\r\nwe at once encounter party again. But the moment he begins to treat a\r\ntheme in which there is any trace of theory, of thought, of fundamental\r\nprinciple, he is obliged to choose his side, to rank himself among the\r\ndisciples of this or that philosophy of life.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, as in Freiligrath's case, we have simply an assertion of\r\nthe poet's right to admire Napoleon and yet to be incensed by the death\r\nof d'Enghien, party does not come into question at all; for all that is\r\nmeant is, that the poet has not dispossessed himself of his right to\r\njudge the past with equity and to see the vices as well as the virtues\r\nof his heroes. The question of party, strictly so called, is not a\r\nquestion of the judging of the past, but of the shaping of the future;\r\nand no man can proceed in two directions at the same time.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty presents itself to us in the word party. It means,\r\ngenerally speaking, part of the population of one's own country. And\r\nthe poet ought to belong to his country and his people, not only to\r\npart of them. Looked upon in this light, party is the narrower, country\r\nthe wider conception, and if by party an actual political party,\r\ncorresponding more or less perfectly to its name or its programme, is\r\nmeant, then as a matter of course country is superior to party.\r\n\r\nBut if we take the word party in the sense in which we use it when we\r\nspeak of Schiller and of Byron as party-men, then party is a wider,\r\na grander conception than country. For by country we understand a\r\ndefinitely bounded tract of land, definitely limited interests, a\r\ndefinitely circumscribed history; but by party in this sense we\r\nunderstand a system of ideas which, from their very nature, are not\r\nconfined to any place--world-wide thoughts, the great general interests\r\nof humanity. And even if the party sided with represents only the great\r\nmoving ideas of one age, an age is a wider, greater native land than\r\na country; and the poet does his people a service by extending their\r\nhorizon beyond their country's bounds.\r\n\r\nBörne and Heine were, in my opinion, both strong party-men, but none\r\nthe less both zealous patriots, their patriotism quite uninjured by\r\ntheir partisanship.\r\n\r\nThe official press of the day proclaimed Börne to be not only a mad\r\nRadical, but a libeller of his country. He had the dangerous habit of\r\nexpressing all his opinions in such violent terms that they offended,\r\nwounded, or incited to action. There was an outcry of indignation when\r\nhe wrote that any nation had a right to depose its king even if it\r\nwere only because it had taken a dislike to the shape of his nose. And\r\nwhole volumes of invective were called forth by his observations on the\r\nservility (_Bedientennatur_) of the Germans. He had gone so far as to\r\ncall them \"a nation of flunkeys.\"\r\n\r\nHe himself writes: \"What can I do with people who really seriously\r\nbelieve that I have advised the nations of Europe to depose their\r\nkings as soon as they take a dislike to their noses.... If I were to\r\nsay: Gentlemen! I did not mean you to take me so literally, they would\r\nperhaps believe me--but that would avail me nothing. They would say:\r\nYou ought to have remembered that you do not write for educated readers\r\nonly, but that a large proportion of your readers are uneducated men.\r\nTo this I would answer nothing but: Take me to prison! Then when I was\r\nbrought into court I would say: Gentlemen! The German is a crocodile!\r\n(Cries of indignation. Crocodile! Order!) Gentlemen! The German is a\r\ncrocodile! (Order! Judge: You are abusing your right of self-defence.)\r\nGentlemen! The German is a crocodile--I beg of you to allow me to\r\ncontinue. When I use the word crocodile I am not hinting at savage\r\ninstincts or crocodile tears. The German is tame and good-natured,\r\nand weeps tears that are as sincere as the tears of a whipped child.\r\nIf I have applied the name of crocodile to the German, it is only on\r\naccount of his skin, which does resemble that of the crocodile. It\r\nconsists of hard scales, and is like a slated roof. Anything solid\r\nthat falls upon it rebounds, anything liquid runs off. Suppose, now,\r\ngentlemen, that you wished to mesmerise such a crocodile, with the\r\nfinal intention of curing his weak nerves, but in the first instance of\r\nmaking him so clear sighted that he could see inside himself, discover\r\nhis own disease, and find out the proper remedy for it. How would you\r\nset about it? Would you gently stroke the crocodile coat-of-mail with\r\nyour warm hand? No, you would not be so foolish; you know that would\r\nmake no impression on it. You would stamp on it, drive nails into it,\r\nand if that were not enough, you would fire a hundred bullets at it,\r\ncalculating that ninety-nine of them would take no effect, and that\r\nthe hundredth would bring about just the mild, modest results your\r\nmesmerism was intended to produce. This is what I have done.\"[3]\r\n\r\nOne sees that Börne's strong language on the subject of German\r\nservility and indolence is simply the negative expression of his\r\npatriotism. It is a patriotism which as a rule finds only indirect\r\nexpression, but we feel it as distinctly in his melancholy derision as\r\nin the enthusiastic demonstrations of others.\r\n\r\nAs regards Heine, Börne's charges were, no doubt, to a certain extent\r\nwell founded. The versatile poet's temperament made the monotonous\r\nstruggle for a political conviction hard for him, and he was, as\r\nwe have already shown, drawn two ways and rendered vague in his\r\nutterances by feeling himself to be at one and the same time a popular\r\nrevolutionist and an enthusiastic aristocrat. But his objection to\r\nconnecting himself with any of the existing political or religious\r\nparties was more a proof of his high intellectual standard than of\r\nanything else. His raillery in _Atta Troll_ at the canting preachers of\r\nthe Opposition is delightful and perfectly justifiable; it only shows\r\nthat he abhorred dogmatism in all its forms.\r\n\r\nBörne is wrong in assuming that Heine, the man, was false to his\r\nparty, taking that word in its greater, wider, signification, namely,\r\nthe ideas for which he contended. For to these he was faithful, even\r\nthroughout the eight long years when he lay on his deathbed, with\r\ndifficulty opening his paralysed eyelids to look for God in that heaven\r\nwhose emptiness he himself had so sadly and defiantly described.\r\n\r\nAnd Heine was as true a patriot as Börne. Every reader of his\r\nworks must remember the beautiful passage at the conclusion of the\r\n_Reisebilder_, in which he tells how the Emperor Maximilian sate in\r\nsore straits in the Tyrol, encompassed by his enemies, forgotten by his\r\nknights and courtiers. Suddenly the door of his prison cell was opened,\r\nand there entered a man in disguise, whom the Emperor recognised as\r\nKunz von der Rosen, his faithful court jester.\r\n\r\nI feel it to be not only beautiful but true when Heine says: \"O German\r\nfatherland! beloved German people! I am thy Kunz von der Rosen. The\r\nman whose only business it was to amuse thee, to cater for thy mirth\r\nin times of prosperity, makes his way into thy prison in time of need.\r\nHere, under my cloak, I bring thee thy strong sceptre and thy beautiful\r\ncrown--dost thou not recognise me, my Emperor? ... Thou liest in\r\nfetters now, but in the end thy rightful cause will prevail; the day of\r\ndeliverance is at hand, a new time is beginning, my Emperor, the night\r\nis over; look out and see the ruddy dawn.\"\r\n\r\nIf we beware of attaching too much importance to single expressions, to\r\nthe wanton or arrogant outbursts scattered here and there throughout\r\nhis works, we shall perceive that the feeling which finds classic\r\nexpression in the words just quoted was very strong in Heine's breast.\r\nNeither his party standpoint, nor the admiration of things foreign\r\nwhich it entailed, affected a very sincere, deep love of his native\r\nland, which made exile in many ways a punishment to him. But he had\r\nnot the kind of patriotism which he somewhere ascribes to the average\r\nGerman, the kind that narrows the heart, makes it shrink like leather\r\nin the cold. His was the patriotism that warms the heart and widens it\r\nuntil it is able to embrace the whole realm of civilization.[4] How\r\ncould he help loving Germany! As he himself has said, and as we all\r\nmust say each of his own country: \"The truth is--Germany is ourselves.\"\r\nHis whole nature and character were determined by his German birth and\r\nupbringing. The second half of his life being spent in an exile that\r\nwas partly voluntary, partly compulsory--in so far a homeless man, that\r\nhis works were prohibited throughout the German Confederation--the\r\nGerman language became to him a true, a grander, a real fatherland. He\r\nhimself called the German tongue the most sacred of all possessions,\r\nthe unsilenceable call to liberty, a new fatherland for him whom\r\nstupidity or malice has banished from the land of his birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] He bows the knee to Bonaparte, the hero, yet d'Enghien's death-cry\r\narouses his wrath: the poet observes from a higher watch-tower than the\r\nbattlements of party.\r\n\r\n[2] What! not a party man! Is not strong party feeling the mother of\r\nall victory? How can a poet calumniate the word in which lies the germ\r\nof all the noblest deeds? Speak out like a man: Are you for or against\r\nus? Is your watchword slavery or freedom? The Gods themselves descended\r\nfrom Olympus and fought on the battlements of party.\r\n\r\n[3] _Letter from Paris_, Dec. 15, 1831.\r\n\r\n[4] Heine: _Werke_, vi. 51. _Cf_. xiv. 45, and xiii. 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMERMANN\r\n\r\n\r\nAll who are familiar with Heine's works or letters are aware of the\r\nwarm friendship and brotherhood in arms that united him in his youth to\r\nKarl Immermann. He proposed to Immermann to insert some of his epigrams\r\nin the _Reisebilder_, and as a matter of fact there are several pages\r\nof them in the book between the divisions _Norderney_ and _Das Buch Le\r\nGrand_. They satirise various literary personages and events of the\r\nday. The attacks on those writers who imitated Oriental forms of poetry\r\nincensed Platen, and induced him to write his dramatic satire, _Der\r\nromantische Oedipus_, which in its turn called forth Heine's well-known\r\nsatire.\r\n\r\nIt was very curious that Platen, in his irritation, should with one\r\nblow stamp as Romanticists the two men who, each in his own way, did\r\nso much (more than Platen himself) to unswathe from the wrappings of\r\nRomanticism a new spirit, a new art--the spirit, the art of modern\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nKarl Immermann (born in 1796) was three years older than Heine. He was\r\nthe son of a correct, austere Government official in Magdeburg, and was\r\nhimself a man of strong character and solid culture, early imbued with\r\nthat old Prussian spirit of which there was not a trace in Heine. They\r\nwere contrasts in almost everything.\r\n\r\nImmermann fought in the battle of Waterloo as a volunteer, entered\r\nParis with the army, afterwards retired with the rank of an officer,\r\nand studied law at the University of Halle. His strong feeling of\r\njustice led him into disputes with the powerful students' union,\r\nTeutonia, which had usurped a kind of moral authority over all the\r\nstudents, and enforced its principles, especially that of purity of\r\nlife, in a domineering, brutal fashion. For several years he continued\r\nto oppose the practices of the Union, and more than once during this\r\ntime was obliged to invoke the power of the law to protect him from the\r\ninsults and persecution to which he was subjected by his antagonists.\r\nThe consequence of this was that he was hated by the great majority as\r\nan informer--the more so as the political reactionaries took advantage\r\nof this opposition to the traditional malpractices of the students'\r\nunions, to attack, and, where it was possible, suppress the unions, a\r\nproceeding for which Immermann was in no way responsible. From this\r\ntime onwards he stood alone. Much in his character, much of its dryness\r\nand peculiarity, had its origin in this isolation, which also favoured\r\nthe development of pride and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMMERMANN]\r\n\r\nIn 1819, Immermann was given a Government appointment (that of\r\n_Divisionsauditor_), in the town of Münster, in Westphalia, an old,\r\nstrictly Catholic, provincial town, where at first he felt himself out\r\nof sympathy with every one and everything. But here, ere long, he made\r\nacquaintance with the woman who was to be the most powerful influence\r\nin his life.\r\n\r\nElisa von Lützow was the wife of Brigadier-General Adolf von Lützow,\r\nthe famous leader of the volunteer corps celebrated in Körner's song.\r\nBy birth she was a Dane, a Countess Ahlefeldt-Laurvig of Tranekjær\r\nin the island of Langeland. When Immermann first saw her she was\r\ntwenty-nine, and, according to the testimony of her contemporaries,\r\na most fascinating woman, graceful, charming, intelligent, of\r\naristocratic bearing, and yet genial. From her earliest youth she had\r\nmade a deep impression on the men who came within her sphere.\r\n\r\nShe had grown up the supposed heiress of great wealth, but in an\r\nunhappy home; her father and mother had become estranged from each\r\nother, and about the time she was fourteen they separated. Count\r\nAhlefeldt, a favourite of Frederick VI., was a pleasure-loving man, a\r\npasha with a constantly changing harem; he was a patron of music and\r\nof the drama, kept a private orchestra, and entertained companies of\r\nFrench and German actors at Tranekjær; so hospitable and recklessly\r\nextravagant was he that even his great wealth could not stand the drain\r\nupon it. What brought Elisa and Immermann together was her applying to\r\nhim for legal advice when her father not only refused to make over to\r\nher what had been left her by her mother, who had died in 1812, but\r\nalso to pay the yearly income which he had settled upon her.\r\n\r\nCount Ahlefeldt long refused his consent to his daughter's marriage\r\nwith the poor and as yet undistinguished foreign officer, but he gave\r\nit in 1810, and when, in 1813, the youth of Prussia joyfully and\r\nenthusiastically rose to arms at the call of Frederick William III.,\r\nand Lützow formed the famous volunteer corps known by his name, his\r\nwild and daring riflemen (_die wilde, verwegene Jagd_) found their\r\nValkyrie in their leader's beautiful wife, who was worshipped by the\r\nwhole regiment as a superior being. Elisa, who appears to have spoken\r\nGerman from her childhood, felt herself at home on German soil, became\r\na faithful daughter of her new fatherland, and identified herself with\r\nits interests. She inspirited the brave, nursed the wounded with heroic\r\ndevotion, was the confidante, helper, and comforter of the best among\r\nthe young men. After a victory, the choicest of the booty was always\r\npresented to her. The lieutenant who first stepped into Napoleon's\r\ncaptured carriage after the fight at Belle-Alliance brought her, as a\r\nremembrance, a pair of gloves and two glasses of the Emperor's.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of peace she lived with her husband in the\r\ndifferent garrison towns to which he was transferred. In 1817 they came\r\nto Münster. The stiff, narrow-minded, bigoted tone of its society was\r\nantipathetic to her; but here, as elsewhere, she gathered round her\r\na circle of enthusiastic admirers, who were charmed by her taste and\r\nby the keen intelligence which she displayed, without being a great\r\ntalker--sometimes only by a smile and a nod.\r\n\r\nTo Immermann she was like a revelation from a higher, nobler world,\r\nfor which in his lonely, joyless life he had been longing. Lützow's\r\nquarters were in a castle-like building that had been a convent, with\r\nhigh windows and great folding doors. Here, surrounded by flowers,\r\nstatues, books, birds, dogs, and admirers, she seemed like a noble\r\nlady of olden days, or one of those princesses of the Renaissance who\r\nattracted poets to their courts and inspired them.\r\n\r\nWith the year 1825 came a great change in Elisa's life. The\r\ngood-natured and chivalrous but volatile and impressionable Lützow fell\r\nso violently in love with an insignificant flirt that he requested his\r\nwife to set him at liberty again. This she was not prepared to do; but\r\nafter she happened to overhear Lützow remark to a friend that when he\r\nwas quite young he had made up his mind to marry a great heiress, a new\r\nlight was thrown upon the determination he had shown in their early\r\ndays to win her, and her feelings towards him changed. Her pride was\r\nhurt; she presently informed him that she would no longer stand in the\r\nway of his happiness, and agreed to a divorce, the reason of which she\r\nkept secret.\r\n\r\nNot an angry word passed between husband and wife. The divorce was\r\npronounced in April 1825. Both before and after it Lützow wrote Elisa\r\nletters which testify to a most friendly feeling and warm admiration.\r\nIt was an unlucky day for him when he took the step which separated\r\nthem. He was universally blamed, and when it came to the point, his\r\ncapricious enslaver would have nothing to say to him. He repented his\r\ndelusion when it was too late. Some years afterwards, in order to make\r\na home for himself again, he married his brother's widow, but this\r\nlady's temper was so bad that it made the last years of his life most\r\nunhappy.\r\n\r\nThe divorce left Elisa homeless and solitary, and this led to\r\ngradually increasing intimacy with young Immermann, who saw in her his\r\nideal, and was passionately desirous to make her his wife. But Elisa\r\nshuddered at the thought of a second marriage; the disillusionments\r\nof her wedded life had disgusted her with matrimony in general, and\r\nshe reflected, moreover, that she was six years older than the young\r\npoet. When Immermann, in 1827, was promoted to the appointment of\r\n_Landesgerichtsrath_ in Düsseldorf, he passionately urged her to\r\naccompany him there. She agreed to do this, though she again refused to\r\nmarry him; both, however, vowed never to think of marriage with any one\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThe lovers inhabited a country house in the village of Derendorf, close\r\nto Düsseldorf, where they had their separate suites of apartments. This\r\nhouse, which lay in a great rose garden, they decorated with exquisite\r\ntaste, and here they lived a full and happy life for a number of years.\r\nDüsseldorf was at that time the resort of many of the best artists in\r\nGermany, painters like Schadow, Lessing, Hildebrandt. Thither, too,\r\ncame poets (like Grabbe), composers (Mendelssohn), art amateurs, and\r\ncritics from all parts. Immermann's and Elisa von Ahlefeldt's house was\r\na rendezvous for all these. In Elisa's circle in Münster, Immermann\r\nhad distinguished himself as a clever reader of dramatic works; here\r\nhe continued to give semipublic readings of the same description.\r\nThis gradually developed a desire on his part to manage a theatre.\r\nHe rehearsed a number of trial plays with the Düsseldorf theatrical\r\ncompany; artists from other parts came to his assistance; the great\r\nactor, Seydelmann from Berlin, played Nathan; Felix Mendelssohn put two\r\noperas on the stage for him and directed the performance.\r\n\r\nElisa's father died in 1832. She did not inherit all the wealth that in\r\nher youth was expected to be her portion, but the cousin who succeeded\r\nto her father's title and property settled a handsome annuity on her.\r\nShe and Immermann now travelled together--on the Rhine, to Dresden,\r\nin Holland; a tour which Immermann took alone is described in his\r\n_Reisejoumal_, which consists entirely of the letters he wrote to\r\nElisa. Everything else was written beside her, and subjected to her\r\naffectionate but frequently severe criticism.\r\n\r\nAfter an existence of three years, Immermann's theatre, failing to\r\nobtain state aid, had to be closed. This was a great grief to him. He\r\nsought to distract himself by a tour in Franconian Switzerland. His\r\n_Fränkische Reise,_ the description of this tour, also consists of\r\nletters to Elisa. They were the last he wrote her. For during this\r\nabsence he met, in Magdeburg, a girl of nineteen, Marianne Niemeyer\r\nby name, who made a very strong impression on him. When he rejoined\r\nElisa he once more, to her surprise, asked her to marry him. As before,\r\nshe refused. It would seem as if he had been pretty certain of the\r\nanswer he would receive, and only desired to salve his conscience.\r\nFor immediately afterwards, unknown to Elisa, he began a lively\r\ncorrespondence with Marianne, proposed to her, and was accepted. Elisa\r\nheard of his engagement from others, and at once resolved to leave\r\nDüsseldorf. She did so in August 1839, Immermann accompanying her and\r\nthe friend with whom she travelled as far as Cologne. Till this time,\r\nin spite of her forty-nine years, she had retained her beauty; now she\r\nsuddenly grew old. In October 1839 Immermann married; in August 1840 he\r\ndied. Elisa survived him fifteen years.[1]\r\n\r\nIt is quite obvious that the connection with Elisa, which for so many\r\nyears was pleasurable and helpful to Immermann, in the end became\r\nburdensome to him. But it is unwarrantable to assert (as Goedeke\r\nhas done) that it was the breaking off of this connection and his\r\nsubsequent lawful marriage which first gave Immermann the creative\r\nvigour which he displayed in his last important work, _Münchhausen_. It\r\nwas conceived and executed under Elisa's influence to quite the same\r\nextent as his other works.\r\n\r\nHer personality and the position in which he stood to her often and in\r\nmany ways influenced his writings. She is supposed to have suggested\r\nhis drama, _Petrarca_, which treats of Petrarch's love of Laura,\r\nand represents the irresistible strength of a passion inspired by a\r\nhigh-born lady even when the said lady is not free. Her views on the\r\nsubject of love, and its unqualified justification as such, are said to\r\nbe recognisable in the drama, _Cardenio und Celinde_. She was probably\r\nhis model for the heroine of the comedy, _Du schelmische Gräfin_, and\r\ncertainly the model for Johanne in the novel _Die Epigonen_. But all\r\nthis is as nothing in comparison with the general development and\r\nrefining influence which she exerted over him as an author.\r\n\r\nImmermann's is a curious fame. Of all his works only one is still read,\r\nhis novel, _Münchhausen_; and only one part of this novel, the smaller\r\nhalf of it (now separated from the rest and published by itself), will\r\ncarry his name down to posterity. This one small volume is in reality\r\nof more value than all the rest of his work.\r\n\r\nIn its construction, _Münchhausen_, following the general rule of the\r\nRomantic tales, was intentionally disorderly; the book begins, for\r\nexample, with the eleventh chapter. The hero, a Westphalian baron, is\r\na descendant of the old lying Münchhausen, and, like him, a fantastic\r\nliar. The whole was meant to be a sort of satiric repertory of the\r\nvarious humbugs and nonsensicalities of the day, amongst which the\r\nauthor's humour might play at will. But out of all this irregular\r\nplay of fancy, which corresponds to the title _Eine Geschichte in\r\nArabesken_, there was gradually developed the great rural romance\r\nwhich has taken a place in German literature under the name of _Der\r\nOberhof_. Its principal characters, the village magistrate (_der\r\nHofschulze_) and the fair-haired Lisbeth, represent a new truth, a new\r\ncreative art. They live and move on \"the red soil\" of Westphalia, and\r\nin their persons the German peasant is for the first time introduced\r\ninto literature without the sentimentality of the pastoral idyll or the\r\ndistortion of the opera ballet, undoubtedly conventionalised, but with\r\ncaste and race individuality. There is a vigorous, fresh naturalness\r\nabout these characters, which will never grow old.\r\n\r\n_Der Oberhof_ has taken its place as the original type of all the\r\nEuropean peasant tales, and in certain points it is superior to any of\r\nthem, old-fashioned in many ways as it now seems. Hundreds of fantastic\r\nthreads connect this admirable story with the romance of Romanticism,\r\nbut it is easy to cut them, and then we have before us as it were\r\nthe hard crystal into which Romanticism finally condensed itself in\r\nImmermann's mind.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom nowadays to regard the peasant tale as a direct\r\noffshoot of Romanticism. Yet it undoubtedly, both in France and in the\r\nNorth, marked the transition to an art which, was more true to nature\r\nthan the Romantic.\r\n\r\nIt signified a complete change of sphere in German art when Immermann\r\ngave up writing historical or fantastic dramas in iambic verse, the\r\nscenes of which were laid in countries which he had never seen,\r\nand portrayed ordinary human life in the little known province of\r\nWestphalia, where he had lived and exercised the functions of a\r\njudge. There were no railways in the Westphalia of those days, and no\r\nmanufactures; but it was a country of patriarchal, wholesome manners\r\nand customs, and he had only to represent it with the faithfulness\r\nwhich illuminates, to produce an effect infinitely surpassing that of\r\nany of the earlier arbitrary creations of his poetic imagination.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy peasant landowner, who is the principal personage in this\r\nstory, is the prototype of all the sturdy, independent farmers of\r\nthe German peasant tales, and of many in those of other countries.\r\nExcellent as many of Auerbach's characters of this type are, he\r\nsurpasses them all in what may be called the historic greatness which\r\nis imparted to this character by the intimate relation which we feel\r\nto exist between it and the far back past of the country. This peasant\r\nappears on the background of traditions still in force, which link the\r\npresent with almost forgotten times.\r\n\r\nHe is a genuine peasant. He is not in the least amiable; he has had\r\nno time to cultivate amiability; from his boyhood, life has been too\r\nhard to allow of that. His distinguishing qualities are sound common\r\nsense, seriousness, obstinacy, pride of position, and permissible\r\nself-interest. There is a granite-like foundation to his character. He\r\nhas the true peasant shrewdness, not to say shiftiness, in business;\r\nhe is always ready to advise his neighbours how best to hold their own\r\nagainst the authorities when any forced sale of land is threatened,\r\nalways on his guard against emissaries of the government, even\r\nwhen their mission is the construction of new roads or some such\r\nimprovement; he is cold in his family relations, and has all the\r\nprejudices of the rustic.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he is great. He rules, and he always carries his point. He\r\nnot only reigns over his own large estate like the stern, patriarchal\r\nkings of old, upholding good old customs, keeping his eye on every\r\none and everything, admonishing in proverbs, rewarding with the\r\nhonour of retention in his service; but, unquestionably the superior\r\nof all his neighbours, he has induced them to regard him as their\r\nleader, and has quietly, without disturbance or revolt of any kind,\r\nled them to free themselves from the supremacy of state authorities\r\nand to rule themselves under him as a sort of judge of the old Jewish\r\ntype. In his district both law-suits and criminal cases are unknown;\r\nno one goes to law with his neighbour; no one is ever accused of a\r\ncrime; one might take it to be an oasis of innocence and peace. It\r\nis far from being that; but since medieval times the secret courts\r\nof justice (_Vehmgerichte_) have existed here, and the peasants,\r\nunder the influence of this great peasant, have agreed to uphold\r\nthese, and thus privately provide for the maintenance of equity and\r\njustice among themselves. They assemble secretly at night in a lonely\r\nplace and settle their own disputes. The sentences are accepted and\r\nexecuted without dispute. The only punishment awarded is a sort of\r\nexcommunication of the malefactor, which is as severe a chastisement as\r\nany that could be imposed by a state judge. A peasant whom all avoid,\r\nwhom no one will help, with whom no one will have any dealings, suffers\r\nfrom almost as strict isolation as the man confined in a prison cell.\r\n\r\nAs a symbol of his power and dignity the old \"Hofschulze\" treasures a\r\nsword, which he believes to be what tradition calls it, the sword of\r\nCharlemagne, and which he regards as his most precious possession. His\r\nhand is on its hilt when he pronounces judgment. This sword, which was\r\ndug up somewhere in the neighbourhood, is really a perfectly common\r\nweapon, possibly two hundred years old; and we have an admirable\r\ndescription of how the old farmer is at times tormented by doubts of\r\nits antiquity, doubts which, with his peasant shrewdness, he tries to\r\ndispose of once for all. He tempts an antiquarian in the neighbourhood\r\nwith the sight of a beautiful amphora, and then obliges him to give in\r\npayment for it a written certification that the sword had undoubtedly\r\nbelonged to Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nThe tragic catastrophe of the story is brought about in this way. A\r\nman who is now a vagrant had, in consequence of an intrigue with the\r\ndaughter of the \"Hofschulze,\" been attacked by her brother and had\r\nkilled him in self-defence. This vagabond, to revenge himself on the\r\n\"Hofschulze\" for the sentence of excommunication which has ruined his\r\nlife, steals the sword and hides it where no one can find it. The loss\r\nbreaks the old man's spirit. All the mysteries of the secret court of\r\njustice are divulged, and he is obliged to stand his trial.\r\n\r\nGranted permission to make a last speech, he says: \"Your Worship! I\r\nhave no doubt that the clerk is noting me down in his minutes as a\r\nfool, and my sword and secret judgment-seat as foolery; for so, if\r\nI mistake not, I heard the young gentleman call the things that lie\r\nnearest to my heart. I would fain give some explanation regarding this\r\nfoolery.\" And he goes on to say how, ever since he could think, he has\r\nobserved that, after calamities such as hailstorms, floods, failure of\r\ncrops, or cattle-plague, some of those gentlemen came to the district\r\nwho not only understand how to write reports, but also how to judge\r\neverything much better than the people concerned; they described the\r\ncalamity after it was past, but were never there at the time to help;\r\nand if a little money happened to be sent, it never reached those who\r\nneeded it most. \"One thing was more astonishing than all else. One\r\nor other of these government gentlemen would order things so in the\r\ndistrict that we peasants could not refrain from laughing at it all.\r\nIn a year or two the same gentleman would come driving in a carriage\r\nand four, with all kinds of ribbons and orders on his breast, looking\r\nas if he had helped to create the world. Thinking over all this in my\r\nplain way, I came to the conclusion that the government gentlemen were\r\nof little service to us peasants; nor did they come to do us service;\r\nthey came to write, and they wrote until they wrote themselves into a\r\ncarriage and four.... And then I thought (for all my life I have been\r\ngiven to thinking) that a steady, industrious man will always get on\r\nif he watches the wind and the weather, and attends to his business\r\nand is a good neighbour.... And first I accustomed myself, even in\r\ntimes of trouble, never to think of help; I paid my taxes and bore my\r\nown burdens ... and then I accustomed my neighbours to do the same.\r\nThey followed my example; we settled our own affairs among ourselves,\r\nand many matters about which much ado would have been made elsewhere,\r\nwere never heard of beyond the bounds of the parish.... By degrees\r\nwe came to settling everything. A peasant has understanding enough to\r\ntell who has the best claim to a certain wall or strip of meadow. And\r\nwhen a house has been broken into, the village nearly always knows who\r\nhas been the thief; but because it is not always possible to bring\r\nsufficient proof, a man well known to be a rascal may impudently and\r\nscandalously show his face and enjoy his booty, which its rightful\r\nowner never recovers. So we quietly took the law into our hands, and no\r\none could accuse us of anything, for we injured no man; we only refused\r\nto hold any communication whatsoever with the evildoers whom we placed\r\nunder the ban; and of this ban men were more afraid than of the judge's\r\nsentence and prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" he concludes, \"if other people would but do the same, if the\r\ntownsmen, the merchants, the noblemen, the scholars, would but manage\r\ntheir own affairs, things would be better than they are. Men would no\r\nlonger be like stupid children, for ever crying for father and mother,\r\nbut every man would be like a prince in his own house and among his\r\nequals. And the king himself would then be a far mightier monarch, a\r\nruler like no other, for he would rule over hundreds of thousands of\r\nprinces,\"\r\n\r\nWe have the feeling at the end of the story that, now the secret is\r\ndivulged and the sword stolen, the days of popular justice are at an\r\nend. But the author gives us his own opinion on this subject by the\r\nmouth of the wise pastor, who declares that the independence which\r\nis the watch-word of this peasant and his friends is a reality which\r\ncannot be done away with by being divulged, that the idea which has\r\nunited them, the idea that a man is dependent on his neighbours, not\r\non strangers who stand in a perfectly artificial relation to him, does\r\nnot require the support of the tribunal under the old lime-tree. In the\r\npeasant farmer himself, the mighty old yeoman, he sees the true sword\r\nof Charlemagne, which no thief can steal, the true backbone of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nObserve that this is written by an author who was a magistrate and the\r\nson of a Prussian government official.\r\n\r\nA marked contrast to the strong, stern figure of the old peasant, but\r\ndrawn with as sure a hand, is Lisbeth, the fair-haired, country girl\r\nwho is the heroine of the tale. Young Count Oswald, who wanders about\r\nthe country shooting, falls in love with her, and it is the eventful\r\nlove-story of these two young people which forms the chief attraction\r\nof the book. Immermann had in his writings long shown himself to be a\r\nfirm believer in the unbounded power of love over humanity, but here\r\nhe tells the story of young love as he had never done before. We have\r\nthe beat and glow of two innocent young hearts. The youth and maiden\r\nmeet, full of budding, swelling, healthy presentiments and hopes. No\r\nrenunciation or disappointment has as yet cooled one drop of their warm\r\nblood. The distance between them is bridged over in an original manner.\r\nThe young sportsman, who has inherited from his parents a taste for\r\nshooting, along with absolute incapacity to hit anything, for once in\r\nhis life succeeds in setting his mark on a living creature; he lodges a\r\nwhole charge of small shot in the girl's shoulder. The shame and regret\r\nhe feels give place in time to ardent love. When she has recovered and\r\nthe two have discovered that they love each other, they go together one\r\nday into the wood.\r\n\r\n\"'I want to ask your wounds to forgive me,' he said--undid her\r\nkerchief, and kissed the small red spots between her breast and her\r\nwhite shoulder. She did not resist; her little hands lay folded on her\r\nlap, and she sat quite still, a resigned victim of love; but she looked\r\nat him bashfully, entreatingly. He could not bear that look; he quickly\r\ncovered breast and shoulders again with the kerchief, fell at her feet,\r\npressed her knees to his heart, and then walked away a few steps to\r\novercome his emotion.\"\r\n\r\nThis suffers in translation. It must be read as it occurs in the\r\noriginal, this little field idyll, in which the lovers play like\r\nchildren; she stands up against him that he may measure her height; he\r\nplays with her curls; from time to time she gently whispers: \"O du!\"\r\nbut this is all she can say; they make a meal on apples and bread,\r\nwhich they buy from a woman they meet, agreeing that novel writers lie\r\nwhen they assert that love lives on air; she eats from his hand and he\r\nfrom hers. It is all as natural and as good as anything of the same\r\nstyle in Auerbach, Keller, or Björnson.\r\n\r\nAnd Immermann's description of the sorrows of love is no less\r\nadmirable. Nothing in the book surpasses the passage in which the old\r\nfarmer tells Lisbeth that her lover is a young nobleman, and makes\r\nher understand that she must not expect him to marry her. Oswald\r\nhas concealed his position and given himself out to be an ordinary\r\nforester, only with the intention of giving her a joyful surprise\r\nlater. If she had taken time to think, she would have come to the\r\nconclusion that she need have no fear of his proving unfaithful.\r\nBut the knowledge that her lover has lied is a blow that upsets her\r\nequilibrium, and Immermann profoundly remarks, \"For love, as long as it\r\nis unshaken, is divine penetration ... but once shaken, once driven to\r\nconjecture and surmise, it is madness, which passes cathedrals without\r\nseeing them and takes molehills for mountains.\" This is a profound\r\nsaying, because it is a true psychological appreciation of a feeling\r\nwhich is the product of unknown causes. Heine's psychology of love\r\nwas very simple; when he complains, it is always of faithlessness as\r\na wrong knowingly committed. Immermann here represents what may be\r\ncalled the somnambulistic action of the feeling, the instinct, unerring\r\nas that of the sleep-walker, which it possesses when undistracted by\r\ndisturbing forces.\r\n\r\nBoth in broad outline and in minute detail this first of the peasant\r\nnovels is sterling poetry. The influence of fantastic Romanticism\r\nis still distinct; the secret tribunal, the sword of Charlemagne,\r\nthe enthusiasm for old customs are Romantic features; even Lisbeth's\r\nfanciful pedigree--the fathering of this truthful young being on\r\nthe old liar Münchhausen--betrays that the tale is an outgrowth of\r\nan earlier Romantic literature. All this, however, only throws into\r\nstronger relief the laborious, yet vigorous, process of condensation\r\nby which healthy, modern realistic appreciation and treatment of\r\npopular subjects was evolved out of the arbitrary fantasticality which\r\nimmediately preceded it.\r\n\r\nImmermann is one of the company of authors, including Daniel Defoe,\r\nl'Abbé Prévost, the Danish poet Wessel, Chamisso, and Bernardin de St.\r\nPierre, who prove that a single volume is enough to carry a writer's\r\nname down to posterity, even if everything else that he has written\r\nbe quickly forgotten. As a matter of fact, only this one work of\r\nImmermann's lives. He wrote mock-heroic poems, such as _Tulifäntchen_,\r\nwhich was much appreciated in its day, but is now unreadable. He\r\nwrote works which, for their day, must be pronounced meritorious,\r\nbut which are now given over to moth and rust, such as the drama\r\n_Merlin_ (1831), a great Romantic work in well-written verse, a sort\r\nof unsuccessful pendant to the Second Part of Goethe's _Faust_ and\r\nthe historic tragedy which was first known as _Das Trauerspiel in\r\nTirol_ (\"The Tragedy in the Tyrol\"), but was re-named _Andreas Hofer_.\r\nThe second of these plays is the better of the two; it is founded on\r\nImmermann's own youthful recollections of the formidable resistance\r\nencountered by the French in the Tyrol, and is written with both the\r\nability and the will to present a faithful and impartial picture of\r\nthe two hostile races, so unlike in their character and in their\r\ndevelopment. This work in its original form, as published in 1826,\r\ncriticised by Börne in his _Dramaturgische Blätter_, and satirised\r\nby Platen in _Der romantische Oedipus_, is interesting, especially\r\nas a sort of mongrel, the offspring of Kleist's genius mated with\r\nSchiller's muse; for the hero reminds us of Schiller's _Wilhelm Tell_,\r\nand the love affair between the Frenchman and the Tyrolese girl, with\r\nits tragic ending, of Kleist's _Die Hermannschlacht_. But the play\r\nwas too devoid of any really profound, impressive originality to live\r\nlong, and when, in 1831, Immermann re-wrote it, suppressing everything\r\nthat had given offence or called forth adverse criticism--the whole\r\nlove-story and the incident (again recalling Kleist) of the sword\r\nwhich the angel restored to Hofer in a dream--he himself took away\r\nwhat life there was in it. Pride, if nothing else, should have made\r\nhim retain the character which Platen had tauntingly nicknamed the\r\n\"Depeschenmordbrandehebruchstyrolerin.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an unlucky chance which made bitter enemies of two lovers of\r\nliberty like Immermann and Platen, and two rare spirits like Platen and\r\nHeine. That which gave rise to the whole literary feud, to the clumsy,\r\nugly attacks on Immermann and Heine in _Der romantische Oedipus_,\r\nto Immermann's retort, _Der im Irrgarten der Metrik umhertaumelnde\r\nCavalier_ (\"The Reeling Knight in the Labyrinth of Metre\"), and to\r\nHeine's crushing attack on Platen in the _Reisebilder_, deadly from its\r\nvery stench, was such a paltry trifle, such an insignificant though\r\ncontemptuous distich, that only an arrogant and quarrelsome disposition\r\nlike Platen's could have made it the occasion of a war with poisoned\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nPlaten's letters show what dire offence he took at the two lines\r\nby Immermann in the _Reisebilder_, which might be construed as\r\nreferring to his ghazels, and how determined he was to revenge himself\r\nruthlessly. Great and serene in the region of pure art, and a manly\r\nchampion of political liberty, he displays in his onslaught on the men\r\nwho had insulted him, an offensively boastful degree of self-admiration\r\nand an insolence which is partly the arrogance of rank and partly the\r\nrecklessness of wounded vanity. His letter from Rome of the 18th of\r\nFebruary 1828, shows that he really knew nothing about Immermann's\r\n_Das Trauerspiel in Tirol_, which he had determined to attack. _Der\r\nromantische Oedipus_ was almost finished when he wrote to Fugger: \"Be\r\nsure to tell me something about Immermann's _Andreas Hofer_, something\r\nof the plot and any piquant nonsense. I need it for the end of my Fifth\r\nAct, where I make him go quite mad.\" The boundless contempt with which\r\nPlaten treats Immermann in his play can thus, in spite of his protests,\r\nonly be regarded as vindictiveness. As regards Heine, it is simply his\r\nJewish birth with which Platen taunts him in both letters and play.\r\nIn the play everything turns on this--Heine is the Petrarch of the\r\nFeast of Tabernacles, the pride of the synagogue. So personal is the\r\nsatire that Nimmermann is made to say, that though he is content to be\r\nHeine's friend, he would not be his mistress, for his kisses reek of\r\ngarlic, &c. From Platen's letters it is easy to see that he completely\r\nunderestimated the strength of the antagonists whom he thus challenged.\r\nHe feels that he is capable of \"crushing that Jew, Heine,\" whenever he\r\nchooses to do so. When his friends try to persuade him that attacks\r\non Heine because of his birth carry no weight, he replies, quite\r\nunmoved: \"That he is, or was, a Jew is no moral offence, but a comical\r\ningredient. Intelligent readers will judge whether or not I have turned\r\nit to account with Aristophanic cunning.\" So sure, so superior does\r\nhe feel himself, that even in December 1828, immediately before he is\r\nutterly discomfited by Heine's return blow, he sees in him nothing but\r\n\"an impudent Jew, a miserable scribbler and sans-culotte.\" His moral\r\nindignation at the first books of the _Reisebilder_ was, however, so\r\ngreat that he calls the author and his like \"veritable Satans.\"[2] The\r\ntreatment he met with was not undeserved; scorn was returned for scorn,\r\nand his underestimation of Heine and Immermann was cruelly avenged. The\r\nscurrilous part of Heine's attack injured himself most by exciting the\r\ndisapprobation of his own friends and admirers.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the names Immermann and Platen came to form a\r\nconstellation of hate was actually due to the similarity of their\r\nnatures, to the feeling of solitariness which, combined with a\r\nself-esteem that was always on the alert, made them prone to proclaim\r\ntheir own praises and to attack others with undue bitterness and\r\nwith insufficient understanding. These two men, each in his own way,\r\nrepresent the transition from Romanticism to modern liberalism. Platen,\r\nwho followed in the footsteps of the Romanticists in his assiduous\r\ncultivation of foreign forms, the oriental ghazel, the southern sonnet,\r\nthe ancient Greek Aristophanic comedy and Pindaric ode, shortly before\r\nhis early death wrote songs and poems (_Political Poems_, including\r\nthe _Polish Songs_--posthumously published) which are on the highest\r\nlevel of spirited modern lyric poetry. And Immermann, who all his life\r\nhad treated tragic or fantastic themes with Romantic extravagance\r\nor symbolism, not long before he died impregnated a piece of homely\r\nreality with a spirit of true poetry by which the following generation\r\nthroughout the whole of Europe was influenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Ludmilla Assing: _Gräfin Elisa von Ahlefeldt_, 1857.\r\n\r\n[2] Platens _Werke_.

Not that Hegel himself sympathised\r\nwith the Revolution of July. Such a violent interference with what to\r\nhim now represented the rational state of things, could hardly appeal\r\nto him, in his sixtieth year, as the great Revolution had done. In\r\npolitics he had long been a strong Conservative.\r\n\r\nBut none the less certainly did the Revolution of July change\r\nthe character of the Hegelian philosophy. It was the historical\r\nturning point, the historical crisis that was needed to transfer\r\nthat philosophy from the lecture-room to the arena of life. One\r\nof the peculiarities of the philosophy was, that it was capable\r\nof diametrically opposite interpretations. From this time onwards\r\nwe observe it to be one of the most powerful instruments in the\r\nremoulding, the reconstruction of life. We saw that it was so in the\r\ncase of Heine, who never alludes to Hegel's conversion to Prussian\r\nConservatism except to apologise for it; to him Hegel is always the\r\ngreat philosopher of the new era, the mighty sovereign of the realm of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEGEL]\r\n\r\nUntil Hegel was called to Berlin he had been unsuccessful as a teacher.\r\nHe had attracted little attention at the other universities, and in his\r\nyounger days had often lectured to only three or four students. Now he\r\nwas at the height of his fame. Unlike Schelling, who reached maturity\r\nso early, and became so early barren, Hegel, the man of heavier,\r\nslower nature, entered the most momentous stage of his career with his\r\nforty-eighth year.\r\n\r\nGreat expectations were formed of him, and he fulfilled them all.\r\nHis insight was extraordinary; he seemed thoroughly to belong to his\r\ntime, and yet to live as it were above it--familiar with all its ideas\r\nand judging them all with calm superiority and profound conviction.\r\nHundreds upon hundreds of listeners streamed to his lecture-room.\r\n\r\nThe young student who saw him for the first time thought him an\r\nodd-looking figure. He had aged early, his originally powerful\r\nfigure was bent, and the impression he produced when he entered the\r\nlecture-room was that of old-fashioned middle-class respectability. He\r\nwent to his desk, seated himself, became absorbed in his manuscript,\r\nturning over the large leaves and looking up and down them for what\r\nhe wanted. His carriage was awkward and characterless, his expression\r\nlistless, his face worn and wasted, not by passion but by the most\r\narduous mental labour. But he had a fine, noble head, and when he\r\nturned his face, with a look of profound, dignified, yet simple\r\nearnestness towards his hearers, the imprint of high intellect was\r\nunmistakable.\r\n\r\nHe began to speak, cleared his throat, coughed and stammered, had\r\ndifficulty in finding his words. He had a strong Swabian accent, and\r\na jerky, unrhythmical delivery; involved himself in long, intricate\r\nsentences which he seldom managed to bring to a satisfactory\r\nconclusion; sought long for the exact word required to express his\r\nmeaning, but never failed to find it; and when found, it always struck\r\nhis hearers as extraordinarily telling, whether it was a perfectly\r\nfamiliar or a very uncommon expression. In time this peculiar delivery\r\nsimply served to make intelligible to the listener the extraordinary\r\ndifficulty and intricacy of the mental process. There might be tiresome\r\nrepetitions, but if the student let his attention wander and missed a\r\nfew sentences, as likely as not he was punished by losing the thread of\r\nthe discourse. For by means of apparently insignificant intermediate\r\nsteps some thought had been made to betray its one-sidedness,\r\nits narrowness, to involve itself in contradictions, and these\r\ncontradictions had to be, or were already, explained away.\r\n\r\nWhat struck one as peculiarly characteristic of his lecturing was\r\nthe combination of two features: the speaker's concentration in his\r\nsubject, which made it seem as if he spoke entirely for its sake; and\r\nhis keen anxiety to make himself plainly understood, which made it seem\r\nas if after all he spoke chiefly for the sake of the hearer.[1]\r\n\r\nHe was a wretched orator, this professor, but a wonderful thinker and\r\nexpounder. The technical terms he employed were bewildering--that\r\nextraordinary terminology in which \"an sich\" meant according to its\r\nconstitution, and \"an und für sich,\" the completed, absolute existence;\r\nbut his hearers became accustomed to it, and soon began to feel as if\r\nthey were floating above the earth in abstractions so refined and so\r\ningeniously complementary that the dialectic of Plato's _Parmenides_\r\nseemed clumsy in comparison; at times as if they were penetrating\r\never deeper into ever more concrete subjects. The speaker's voice\r\ngrew stronger, he looked round with a free, confident glance while,\r\nwith a few pregnant words, he characterised an intellectual movement,\r\nan age, a nation, or some specially remarkable individual, such as\r\nthat nephew of Rameau's who, without being named, is described in the\r\n_Phænomenology_.\r\n\r\nThe novice who heard the famous thinker propound, without any\r\nillustration, the abstract ideas which applied to everything--spirit\r\nand nature, matter and mind--ideas of which it was said that they\r\nenclosed the seen and the unseen in their mysteriously but methodically\r\nwoven net--might at first feel tempted to run away, or at any rate not\r\nto come back again.\r\n\r\nBut he did come back, for the laborious delivery soon fascinated him,\r\nand he began to feel that he was making progress. Every now and then\r\na lightning-flash of thought illuminated the darkness. The pupil\r\nbegan to comprehend that, in his master's mind, there was no question\r\nof this being a system like other systems, a more profound or more\r\ncomprehensive plan of instruction than other plans, but that the man\r\nregarded himself as the originator of an entirely new science, which\r\ncomprehended the whole of existence, explained everything, God and\r\nthe world, and was the completion of everything; for the thoughts of\r\nall earlier thinkers were discernible in his system, as all the lower\r\nanimal forms are traceable in the human embryo; everything that had\r\ngone before had prepared his way, all endeavours found their fulfilment\r\nin him; from this time forwards progress could only lie in the\r\ndirection of more special development of the separate sections of the\r\ngreat completed plan.\r\n\r\nThe pupil was henceforth under the master's magic spell. The very\r\nabstruseness of the terminology was now an attraction the more;\r\ndifficulties acted as spurs; it seemed to him a point of honour, a\r\nmatter of vital importance, that he should understand. And with what\r\nrapture he understood!--understood that the whole world of sense\r\nwas only appearance; the great reality was thought. These separate,\r\nindividual appearances were not real, not true, only the universal was\r\nreal. I think, and by inevitable laws the progress of my thought leads\r\nme to the complete understanding of myself and of the world. I think my\r\nown thought, not regarding it as my own, but as the universal thought,\r\nas the thought of all other human intelligences in union with mine; I\r\ndeprive them all of the individuality which appears to be essential\r\nbut is not, and see in all these intelligences one intelligence, and\r\nin it the principle of existence. This first principle, which finds\r\nits highest expression in man, is that which permeates, which creates\r\nthe world. This first principle, which works and creates blindly in\r\nnature, is in me conscious of itself. The absolute, the idea, that\r\nwhich is popularly known as God, is not a conscious or personal being,\r\nfor consciousness and personality presuppose the existence of something\r\noutside the consciousness and personality; and yet it is not quite\r\nunconscious. Man's consciousness of God is God's self-consciousness. I\r\ncease to live as a single, fortuitous human being, in order to feel the\r\nuniversal life live and pulsate in me.\r\n\r\nLogic, which has been nothing but a sort of childish scholastic\r\ndiscipline, which inculcated self-evident facts by the aid of barbaric\r\nformulæ (Barbara, Celarent, Ferio, Camestres, Baroco), logic, which\r\nhad languished and died in ignominy long ago, came to life again in\r\nthe doctrine of the thoughts of existence in their connection and\r\ntheir unity; for the first thought necessitated, produced the second,\r\namalgamated with it into a third, which in its turn summoned up its\r\nantithesis, which was at the same time its complement. Thought of\r\nnecessity produced thought, until the thought-serpent set its tooth\r\ninto its own tail, thus forming one inviolable circle, from which the\r\nrealms of nature and spirit again detached themselves, dropping as the\r\nrings dropped from Draupner, the ring of Odin.\r\n\r\nAnd all the sciences came and drank of the new metaphysic, as of a\r\nfountain of life, and all renewed their youth. And the system gradually\r\nrose before the disciple's eye, homogeneous, carefully articulated,\r\nseverely symmetrical, of an internal infinity, a spiritual Organon,\r\na gigantic Gothic cathedral, every little part of which repeated\r\nthe whole, every little triad the great Trinity--thought, nature,\r\nand spirit. It rose, built upon the granite foundation of thought,\r\nall the buttresses and arches of the realm of nature supporting it\r\nas it mounted towards the spirit, soaring to heaven in the mighty\r\nthree-storied tower of which religion formed the lowest, art the\r\nmiddle, and philosophy the highest course.\r\n\r\nBut even more to the disciple than the system was the method. For\r\nthe method, the imperative thought-process, was the key to earth and\r\nto heaven. It was by virtue of the method that he understood. It was\r\nby virtue of the method that he saw the history of the world to be a\r\nconnected drama, one grand drama of liberation, in which every race had\r\nits part, and all the parts were interdependent.\r\n\r\nIt was, after all, a truly great thought-poem, which men took for a\r\nscientific demonstration; a new species of poetry, more dramatic and\r\nmore masterly in construction than that which Schelling's intellectual\r\nperception had revealed to him; a new intoxicant, more subtle and\r\npotent than that provided by the natural philosopher. The system has,\r\nindeed, collapsed, the machinery of the method, too fine and intricate,\r\nhas come to pieces in our hands; only a few of the great fundamental\r\nthoughts remain. But he who in his early youth has passed through the\r\nHegel period in his own mental experience, perfectly understands the\r\nrapturous enthusiasm of the youth of that day, and the strength they\r\ndrew from these cosmic thoughts, world-ideas.\r\n\r\nAmong Hegel's pupils about the year 1830 there were already\r\nmaster-thinkers like Hotho, Gans, Marheineke, Michelet; and almost all\r\nthe men of mark who appeared in the most diverse intellectual domains\r\nfrom this time until far on in the Fifties, belonged at first to the\r\nHegelian school--Rosenkranz and Werder, Strauss and Fischer, Feuerbach,\r\nMarx, and Lassalle. Cousin came from France, Heiberg from Denmark, Vera\r\nfrom Naples, to fit themselves for propagating his doctrines in their\r\nnative countries.\r\n\r\nFrom the professorial chair in Berlin, the Hegelian philosophy spread\r\nthroughout Germany, throughout the earth. Seldom or never has a\r\nspiritual monarch's throne stood so secure. At the time of Hegel's\r\ndeath (by cholera) in 1831, his followers compared him to Aristotle, to\r\nAlexander the Great, even to Christ.\r\n\r\nOn the literature of the following decade, and in especial on the\r\nso-called Young Germany, Hegelianism acted as an emancipating spiritual\r\npower, a power that destroyed faith in religious dogma and freed the\r\nindividual from the burden of the Christianity of the State church.\r\nWe have already observed that even such an essentially lyric nature\r\nas Heinrich Heine's took on the tinge of Hegelianism in this respect,\r\nquite independently of the fact that his keen understanding was trained\r\nin the school of Hegel; in the peculiar turn of his wit we trace the\r\ninfluence of the Hegelian dialectic, which makes every idea pass over\r\ninto its opposite (unity of opposites).\r\n\r\nBut it was as a sort of modern Hellenism that the Hegelian philosophy\r\nexercised the most powerful influence upon young minds. What may be\r\ncalled Hegel's Hellenic influence was even stronger than Goethe's.\r\n\r\nThe reader doubtless remembers the passage in Heine's book on Börne in\r\nwhich he writes on Börne's Nazarenic narrowness. He tells us that he\r\ncalls it \"Nazarenic\" to avoid employing the words Jewish or Christian,\r\nwords which to him convey the same meaning, because he does not use\r\nthem to designate a faith but a disposition, a nature; and he places\r\nthe word Nazarenic in opposition to the word Hellenic, which also to\r\nhim signifies an innate or acquired disposition and view of things\r\ngenerally. In other words, all humanity is divided for him into\r\nNazarenes and Hellenes, men with ascetic, image-hating dispositions,\r\ninclined to morbid spiritualisation, and men of cheerfully realistic\r\ntemperament, inclined to genial self-development. And he designates\r\nhimself a Hellene--a name which no Romanticist would ever have bestowed\r\non himself.\r\n\r\nHellenism in this sense emanated abundantly from Hegel. His whole\r\nintellectual bent is in the direction of that tendency of the time to\r\npresent modern matter in antique manner, which we observe in Goethe\r\nwhen he writes his _Iphigenia_, and in Thorvaldsen when he represents\r\nthe Princess Barjátinska in Greek dress. It was not by mere chance that\r\nHegel and Thorvaldsen were born within a few months of each other in\r\nthe year 1770. Nor was it a mere accident that Hegel best understood\r\nthat side of Goethe's nature which turned towards Greece.\r\n\r\nHegel had received his early training in his native country,\r\nWürtemberg, under two influences, that of eighteenth century\r\nenlightenment with its revolt against theology, and that of classic\r\nantiquity. Even as a schoolboy he was keenly interested in the study of\r\nthe Greek language and literature; as a mere child he was devoted to\r\nthe _Antigone_ of Sophocles, which in later life was to him the typical\r\nGreek work of art, and is constantly referred to in his writings. He\r\ndeclared the study of the ancient classics to be the real introduction\r\nto philosophy, and his own system as a whole he gradually moulded on\r\nthe plan of the ancient systems. It stands in the same relation to the\r\nAristotelian structure of thought in which Goethe's _Iphigenia_ stands\r\nto a play of Euripides, or Thorvaldsen's \"Triumphal Procession of\r\nAlexander\" to the frieze of the Parthenon.\r\n\r\nHis primary natural disposition towards Christianity is shown in\r\nhis studies and researches as a youthful theologian, the substance\r\nof which, taken from the original manuscripts, has been given to\r\nthe public by Haym. In these early writings he maintains that the\r\nGreco-Roman religion was a religion for free men, that a free\r\ncommunity, a free state, was the highest ideal of the Greek, an\r\nideal to which he consecrated his labour and his life. The God of\r\nChristianity was only a substitute for lost republican liberty. Men\r\nhad lost power; they could no longer will, but only wish and pray. And\r\nthe more slavish they grew, the more was a God outside of themselves\r\nand above themselves a necessity to them. And it is Hegel's opinion\r\nthat for us, in our days, has been reserved the task of demanding the\r\nreturn of those treasures--the property of man--that were flung up into\r\nheaven. In this he anticipates Heine and Feuerbach.[2]\r\n\r\nIn his youth Hegel always sees Jewish antiquity through classic\r\nspectacles. He calls their ancient history \"a condition of unmitigated\r\nugliness.\" The great tragedy of the Jewish nation is, he says, a very\r\ndifferent thing from a Greek tragedy; it neither awakens pity nor\r\nterror; for these feelings are only called forth by the fate following\r\non the inevitable errors of a noble nature. He sees the history and\r\nfate of the Jews against a background of Sophoclean conception of\r\nlife and Aristotelian theories. Such ideas as law and punishment are\r\nrepugnant to him. The Christian doctrine of the forgiveness of sin\r\nhe can only accept by converting it into the idea of fate reconciled\r\nby love. In other words, he can only admire the sufferings of Christ\r\nwhen he looks upon them as he looks upon the sufferings of Oedipus in\r\nColonos, namely, as a fate overtaking the innocent, not as a sacrifice\r\noffered for the sins of others.\r\n\r\nAll that he rescues for himself from the shipwreck of positive religion\r\nis the person and life-story of Jesus--that beautiful divine-human\r\npersonal life which is to him an equivalent for the citizen-life of\r\nthe ancient world. But his Jesus is not Jesus pure and simple, but a\r\nJesus-Apollo such as Heine describes in his poem _Frieden_--the giant,\r\nwho bears the red, flaming sun in his breast for a heart. We have a\r\nsimilar fusion of heathenism and Christianity in the well-known preface\r\nto _Romancero_, where Heine talks of his last genuflection \"before the\r\never blessed goddess of beauty, our dear lady of Milo.\" For this is not\r\nVenus pure and simple, but Venus-Madonna.\r\n\r\nThus Hegel himself is the originator of that pagan Hellenism, of which\r\nit was the fashion to accuse Young Germany.\r\n\r\nAnd in his philosophy we can even detect the spirit which might\r\nevolve such a watchword as \"the emancipation of the flesh.\" This was\r\na French expression introduced by Heine into German literature, which\r\nwas eagerly taken up by his admirers and imitators, and was specially\r\nexecrated by the enemies and denouncers of the new literature. It\r\ncertainly might be suspected of an immoral meaning in Heine's mouth\r\nand of an ugly meaning in Heinrich Laube's; but amongst the best of\r\nthe men of the young generation it meant nothing but what Goethe and\r\nHegel, too, had in reality desired. Karl Gutzkow has insisted, and\r\nwith reason, that only a low mind coupled with this expression ideas\r\nof licence for all bad passions. For the word flesh in itself conveyed\r\nno objectionable meaning. The New Testament says: \"The Word was\r\nmade flesh.\" Flesh, in the Christian acceptation of the word, means\r\nthe natural, the unbaptised, the original man. Its emancipation in\r\nreality meant to the young enthusiasts of the day nothing more than\r\nthe restoring of her rights to nature, war against what is contrary\r\nto nature. What they desired was to make the laws of nature the rule\r\nof conduct, to release nature from interdict and ban.[3]\r\n\r\nA neo-Hellenism realised in the Hegelian spirit was what was present to\r\ntheir minds.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem a matter of great consequence to them that Hegel should\r\nend his days as a rigid Prussian Conservative, or that his _Philosophy\r\nof Right_ should recognise all existing institutions as \"holy things,\"\r\nand make out the highest ethical conceptions to be \"idols.\" He had\r\nunderestimated the strength of the scientific doubt of the day.\r\n\r\nHow many institutions still presented themselves as objects of\r\nveneration and faith to the normal mind of the period? Four at\r\nmost--the monarchy, the church, marriage, and property. As regards\r\nthese, Hegel's doctrine is as follows:\r\n\r\nHe does not uphold the monarchy as a guarantee for continuity in the\r\nexecution of great political plans; no, the monarch is to him simply\r\nthe logically necessary pinnacle of the state-building, something like\r\nthe dot over the i--a most inconsistent position of Hegel's; to him in\r\nall other instances the subjective (the personal) is only a transient\r\nform of energy, so that logically the monarch ought to be in time\r\nmerged in the sovereignty of the State. His defence of monarchy is thus\r\na concession to existing circumstances. Was it any wonder that the\r\nfollowing generation drew its own logical conclusion?\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Church, Hegel took up the position which was\r\nsubsequently publicly taken up by his disciple Cousin as French\r\nMinister of State. He allowed his followers, the so-called Hegelians\r\nof the Left, men like Göschen, to demonstrate the harmony of his\r\nphilosophy with the Bible and with ecclesiastical Christianity,\r\nactually in his review bestowing excessive praise on Göschen's\r\naphorisms. The man who in his youthful letters to Schelling had\r\nattacked the philosophy of Kant because it could be made to lend itself\r\nto the service of orthodoxy, the man who had adjured Hölderlin never\r\nto make peace with dogma, now in his own religious philosophy took\r\nthe ambiguous course of making out every dogma to be the symbol of a\r\nthought, and allowing the dogma to stand, with the explanation that it\r\nfiguratively expressed the same truth as science. Was it any wonder\r\nthat his pupils drew their own inferences?\r\n\r\nMarriage, Hegel regarded as an incident in family life, justified to\r\nmuch the same extent as family property. How it was brought about\r\nwas of comparatively small importance; arrangement by the parents\r\nwas probably the most moral way. In his aversion from the arbitrary\r\naction of the individual, he dwelt on the irrationality of the private\r\nindividual's capricious fancy for this or that girl (\"dass er sich\r\ngerade auf dieses Mädchen capricionire\"). He spoke on this subject half\r\nlike an old Spartan, half like a narrow old bourgeois, and the youth of\r\nthe day, being neither Spartan nor narrow, did not accept his doctrine.\r\n\r\nProperty Hegel considered morally justified only as the common\r\nproperty of the family. Only when it is not the possession of an\r\nindividual is what he calls the egotism of greed overcome. Of course\r\nhe vehemently condemns Communism. But an impetus had been given to\r\nlogical conclusion-drawing, and the time came when Hegelians like Marx\r\nand Engels drew revolutionary conclusions from the philosophy of the\r\napparently Conservative master.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Hotho: _Vorstudien für Leben und Kunst_, p. 383.

And among the men of Young Germany there were those who\r\nwere destined for ever to remain beginners. More especially is the\r\ntransition from Heine to his successors felt like a fall from graceful,\r\ngod-like audacity to clumsy youthful defiance of all established\r\ncustom, all conventional morality.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the best of these men in their best moments displayed a\r\nself-devotion unknown to Heine.\r\n\r\nThe Young Germany of accepted tradition includes neither Heine, Börne,\r\nand their contemporaries (who were regarded as its fathers), nor the\r\ncircle of young scientific men who expressed their views in Ruge's and\r\nEchtermeyer's _Hallische Jahrbücher_, nor the group of political poets\r\nwho in the Forties gave literary expression to the feelings which found\r\npractical expression in the deeds of 1848.\r\n\r\nThe name in its traditional acceptation has a much narrower\r\nsignification than that given to it in the present volume.\r\n\r\nIts originator was a very earnest, but not specially gifted North\r\nGerman author, Ludolf Wienbarg, born at Altona in 1803. In 1834, under\r\nthe warlike title of _An Æsthetic Campaign_ (a title invented by Campe,\r\nthe publisher), Wienbarg published a series of lectures which he had\r\ndelivered in Kiel, and for which he had been deprived of his right to\r\nlecture, though their inoffensive matter and their unctuous manner\r\nwere little calculated to produce excitement of any kind. To this\r\nbook, which it is a hard task to wade through nowadays, is prefixed\r\nthe dedication: \"To the young Germany, not the old, I dedicate this\r\nbook\" (Dem jungen Deutschland, nicht dem alten, widme ich dieses\r\nBuch). This is all that men remember to-day of Wienbarg's lectures. By\r\nyoung Germany he meant all the young German minds that had broken with\r\ntradition in art, church, state, and society, and were devoting their\r\nliterary talents to the furtherance of the reforms which they felt to\r\nbe imperative.\r\n\r\nThe programme he proposes for the new literature is alarming in its\r\nvagueness. Its conception of life is to be founded on a harmonious\r\nunion of sensuality and spirituality. He proclaims a new Hellenism, in\r\nwhich the sensual will be more permeated by spirit than in the case of\r\nthe Greeks, and the spiritual more permeated by the sensual than in the\r\ncase of the Christians. But before literature can be born again, life\r\nitself must be. Not till the life around them has become healthy and\r\nharmonious, can the young generation produce a true work of art.\r\n\r\nThere was, as we see, nothing new in these declamations and prophecies.\r\nHeine had already said the same thing in a hundred ways, comic or\r\npoetic; even Menzel in his first period had said the same with all the\r\neloquence of the unsuccessful poet and violent partisan. Here it was\r\nexpressed in the flowery language and with the rhetoric which seldom\r\nfails to produce its effect on immature minds.\r\n\r\nThe only novelty lay in the fact that now for the first time the\r\nexponent of these ideas was a representative of that young generation\r\nwho regarded Heine as the great author of the age, and that now for\r\nthe first time expression was given to the theory that prose was the\r\nliterary form of the new age, and of more value than poetry. Wienbarg's\r\næsthetic theories resolve themselves into glorification of Heine,\r\nwhom he proclaims to be the great, the greatest prose author. Not till\r\nnow, he declares, under the influence of French prose, has German\r\nprose really been formed. Schiller's style he calls the language of\r\nthe parade, and Goethe's the language of the court. All the earlier\r\ngreat authors, even Jean Paul, lived, according to him, within a magic\r\ncircle, far removed from the stir of the world. What distinguishes the\r\nprose of a Heine, a Börne, a Menzel, a Laube, from that of the earlier\r\nwriters is, in his opinion, the want of tranquillity, of placidity\r\n(Behaglichkeit), but it is this want that gives it its superiority, the\r\nsuperiority of life. Heine especially is praised for having disdained\r\n\"the passing fame\" of a lyric poet in order to play upon the colossal,\r\ncosmic instrument which lies under the hands of a master of German\r\nprose.\r\n\r\nFirst Mundt and then Laube, neither of whom was capable of writing a\r\nrespectable verse, joined eagerly in this glorification of prose at\r\nthe expense of poetry, the more willingly as by so doing they entered\r\na protest against the Swabian school of poetry, the tardy offspring of\r\nUhland's branch of Romanticism. Mundt positively elevated this cult\r\nof prose to the rank of the newest gospel. How little real ability\r\nWienbarg possessed is clearly shown by his second work, _Zur neuesten\r\nLitteratur_, a collection of weak essays, in which the only thing we\r\nfind to admire is his courageous fidelity to Heine at a time when\r\nenvious rivals and moral doctrinaires had turned the tide of popular\r\nopinion against him.\r\n\r\nWienbarg had called the name Young Germany into existence, but as yet\r\nit designated no exactly specified group of authors. Strangely enough\r\nit was first applied to definite individuals in connection with a\r\npublic denunciation and harsh legal proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe facts were as follows: A number of young authors had gradually\r\nbrought themselves into notice, who were not exactly in league with\r\neach other, but whose common watchword was, spiritual emancipation.\r\nThey all held aloof from Christianity and dreamed of a new, pantheistic\r\nreligion for the new era. Many of them desired, under the name of\r\n\"the emancipation of the flesh\" or \"rehabilitation of the flesh,\" the\r\nabolishment of the traditional code of morals, and more freedom in\r\nthe conditions regulating the union and separation of the two sexes.\r\nBoth the expression of this desire and the desire itself were, in the\r\ncase of a man like Laube, unpleasantly epicurean, in the case of a man\r\nlike Gutzkow, unnecessarily defiant and curiously morbid; with others\r\nagain, such as Mundt, it took the form of championship of what he\r\nvaguely called the emancipation of woman, by which he merely meant more\r\nindependence in home life and in marriage. By all these authors certain\r\ndistinguished women were held in high honour--in France, George Sand,\r\nby whom they were strongly influenced; in Germany, Rahel, Bettina,\r\nCharlotte Stieglitz.\r\n\r\nThey all talked much and loudly of the rights of youth, had all imbibed\r\na certain faith in liberty from Hegel, and all owed their general\r\npolitical tendency to the Revolution of July. Their aim was to identify\r\nliterature with life, as Hegel had reconciled idea with reality. They\r\nhad no really profound sympathy with each other, and they soon went\r\neach his own way. They were widely enough separated as regarded their\r\nplaces of residence. Heine lived in Paris, Weinbarg at Kiel--entirely\r\nisolated; Gutzkow resided in South Germany, Mundt was in Berlin,\r\nLaube in Leipzig; and the distances separating these places were\r\nvery considerable then. Laube was very soon in many ways an opponent\r\nof Gutzkow, and a cold, unpleasant critic of Mundt and Kühne. Mundt\r\nattacked Gutzkow. An accidental meeting between Laube and Gutzkow in\r\nthe north of Italy in 1833 contributed to their estrangement rather\r\nthan their reconcilement. There was no other community between these\r\nwriters than that usually existing between men of the same age and\r\ncalling; they were much less a political party than a literary coterie;\r\nnevertheless literature was not to them its own aim and end; they\r\ndesired to devote themselves to the service of the spirit of the age.[1]\r\n\r\nThis was the reason why they did not occupy themselves with the pure\r\nforms of literary art, neither with epic nor with lyric poetry, and but\r\nsparingly with dramatic. They all idolised the \"Zeitgeist\" (spirit of\r\nthe times), and did homage to it in journalism and fiction, in critical\r\nand argumentative essays, in fanciful descriptions of travel, after\r\nthe pattern of Heine's and Prince Pückler-Muskau's, and at times in\r\nlong-winded novels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KARL GUTZKOW]\r\n\r\nThe most able of them all was undoubtedly Karl Gutzkow, born in\r\nBerlin in 1811, a man of a tireless, energetic, inquiring spirit,\r\nabsorbed in the thousand problems of modern life, a cross between an\r\nanalytical critic and a poet, but a man to whom nothing came of itself\r\nand who achieved nothing with ease. His personality had no charm, his\r\nyouth no freshness, his prose no rhythm. But he was bold, inventive,\r\nintelligent, and enterprising. He had the gift of pathos, but not the\r\nlyric gift; his style was effective, but unmelodious. His mind was\r\nspecially open to ideas, to all the thoughts and spiritual movements\r\nthat were abroad at that day. By nature he belonged to the ungainly,\r\nbut his literary enthusiasm was so genuine, his ambition so great, and\r\nhis will so strong, that he gradually became an intellectual centre and\r\ndiffused his influence in many directions. There was a time, about the\r\nyear 1840, when a great part of what was best in German literature took\r\nits tone from him and his adherents.\r\n\r\nWe saw how it was the Revolution of July that awakened in him a\r\ndesire to write. The following year, the great year of dismissals,\r\nimprisonments, and banishments in Prussia, put the pen into his hand.\r\nIt was a time when every word underwent the strictest censorship; even\r\nthe advertisements in the _Intelligenzblatt_ were carefully examined,\r\nin case they might contain some hidden political meaning.\r\n\r\nGutzkow began by publishing a newspaper, _Forum der Journallitteratur_.\r\nHe had been brought up on the Hegelian idea of the progress of the\r\nworld towards ever greater liberty. As Gottschall has expressed it:\r\n\"There swam before his eyes a constant succession of political sunrises\r\nand world-liberating theories.\" His newspaper reached a circulation of\r\nseventy copies, and was then given up.\r\n\r\nWolfgang Menzel, at that time the acknowledged master of German\r\ncriticism, had repeatedly invited Gutzkow to come to Stuttgart and\r\nassist him in the editorship of his _Litteraturblatt_, as he himself,\r\nhaving been elected a member of the Würtemberg Parliament, was no\r\nlonger able to conduct it alone.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his hatred of Goethe, nay, partly because of it, Menzel,\r\nat this period of his career, was revered by the youth of Germany much\r\nas Katkóf and Ploug in their first periods were revered in Russia and\r\nDenmark. He, above all others, was to them the man of the day, the\r\nfriend of liberty. One of Gutzkow's aims in his newspaper had been to\r\ndefend Menzel, the man after his own heart, against the attacks of\r\nhis enemies--and Menzel had many enemies, for as a reviewer he was\r\ndisputatious, quarrelsome, and abusive. But he was, or seemed to be,\r\na man of sincere convictions. He urged the necessity for a profounder\r\nconception of patriotism and of religion than was then in vogue, but\r\nat the same time he was an ardent Liberal in politics, and as such an\r\nadmirer of Börne and Heine, who looked upon him as a trusty companion\r\nin arms; in Parliament he championed all progressive measures, amongst\r\nothers the emancipation of the Jews.\r\n\r\nGutzkow, not yet much over twenty, short, slight, fair, and pale-faced,\r\nentered the presence of his lord and master, who was thirteen years\r\nolder than himself, with a bashful reverence which he has compared to\r\nthat of the student who appears before Mephistopheles-Faust in the\r\nfirst part of Goethe's drama. He saw a man with broad shoulders, a well\r\ndeveloped chest, and dark hair, whose clean-shaven face reminded him\r\nof a Romish priest's. Round the mouth, with its ugly yellow teeth, a\r\nsatiric smile played; the expression of the short-sighted eyes behind\r\nthe spectacles was half defiant, half dignified. The man's temper\r\nseemed to be violent, his will inflexible. An expression of faun-like\r\nsensuality would come over his features when he talked of some erotic\r\nbook, and yet Goethe's worldliness was as hateful to him as his\r\nindifference to politics, and he uncritically bowed the knee to men and\r\nphenomena that to his mind represented the mysterious. His character\r\nwas a genuine priestly blend of irony and mysticism. He loved Voltaire,\r\nand enthusiastically admired Görres.\r\n\r\nMaster and pupil agreed well at first, both in their social and in\r\ntheir business relations. Gutzkow, who lived now in one, now in another\r\nof the towns in the neighbourhood of Stuttgart, indefatigably reviewed\r\nthe great parcels of books sent him by Menzel. He soon caught the\r\nbrisk, sweeping journalistic style, and all went well. The youthful\r\nworks which he himself published, naturally found a more than lenient\r\ncritic in Menzel. Yet they were poor enough. _Briefe eines Narren an\r\neine Närrin_ (\"Letters from a Male to a Female Fool\") are humorous\r\neffusions without originality, in a style which is partly an imitation\r\nof Jean Paul, partly of Heine; and _Maha Guru, the History of a God_,\r\nthe description of the psychological condition of a Tibetan who is made\r\nDalai-Lama and consequently worshipped as a divinity, is a piece of\r\nfantastic writing, now totally unreadable. Yet Menzel, when reviewing\r\nthis latter book, chose from amongst the vignettes which alternately\r\nfigured on the title-page of his review, a laurel wreath, and had\r\nGutzkow's name twice printed within its circle.\r\n\r\nGutzkow's intention in _Maha Guru_ was to show how the god who is\r\nsupposed to be incarnated in the Dalai-Lama is subordinated to the\r\nman in him, the false divinity being completely thrown into the shade\r\nby the true nobility, true divinity of the human being. But besides\r\nthis, the book was intended to be a philosophical-satirical romance\r\nin the old style, representing home institutions in foreign guise.\r\nThe Tibetan theocracy was intended to suggest the European hierarchy,\r\nthe Tibetan polyandry the European emancipation of woman. The foreign\r\nscenery, which Gutzkow had never seen, the foreign customs, which were\r\nnot described for their own sake, could not interest. The book was\r\nsuggested to him by the story of the French atheist, Billaud-Varennes,\r\nwho escaped the guillotine during the Reign of Terror, took refuge in\r\nAmerica, and was there worshipped by the Indians as a god. His skill in\r\ncatching, training, and stuffing birds made such an impression on them\r\nthat they looked upon him as a second creator. But all this had little\r\nto do with Tibet, and the would-be gravity of Gutzkow's theme.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Young Germany and its fathers had not seemed to Menzel\r\nto be sacrilegious scoffers or bad patriots. Gutzkow's irreligion so\r\nfar had not disturbed the good relations between him and his master.\r\nMenzel himself praised Börne's _Letters from Paris_, which were\r\nattacked on all sides, as manly utterances, and excused their strong\r\nexpressions as outbursts of feeling which must not be too roughly dealt\r\nwith; he compared them to the glow-worms which shine so beautifully on\r\nmild summer nights, but which turn into poor little grey insects when\r\nseized by rough hands.\r\n\r\nBut it was inevitable that the tie between Gutzkow and Menzel should\r\nsoon be loosed. From the first Gutzkow had received warnings not to\r\ninvolve himself too deeply with the Stuttgart author. Hegel himself,\r\nwho took an interest in the young man, had said to him: \"How can any\r\none bind himself to a man like that?\" The first disagreement between\r\nthem was on the subject of Menzel's attitude to the South German lyric\r\npoets, the so-called Swabian school, followers of Uhland, a poet who\r\nnot only enjoyed the fame which he most undoubtedly deserved, but a\r\nfar greater. As a good Swabian, Menzel esteemed and supported these\r\nmen--Gustav Schwab, Gustav Pfizer, Karl Mayer, &c.--as bulwarks of\r\nconventional piety and morality. But Gutzkow, with his keen sense of\r\nwhat was the life-idea of the time, Gutzkow, to whom literature was the\r\nchurch militant, had the greatest objection to such Sunday afternoon,\r\ngilt-edged poets, men who put into rhyme old, dead ballad themes, or\r\ntheir own petty, sentimental feelings, whilst they were cautiously\r\nwatching over their interests as government servants aspiring to\r\nprofessorships or consistory counsellorships.\r\n\r\nWhen _Goethe's Conversations with Eckermann_ appeared, it became known\r\nhow severely Goethe had judged his admirer Uhland's poetry. He would\r\nhear of nothing but the ballads, considering all the rest unworthy of\r\nnotice. And a most contemptuously disparaging verdict upon the whole\r\nSwabian school, from Uhland to Pfizer, was presently published in\r\n_Goethe's Correspondence with Zelter_: he (Goethe) had never expected\r\nanything fresh or capable from that quarter; the fellows concealed\r\ntheir want of genius under the moral-religious-poetical beggar's cloak.[2]\r\n\r\nAfter this Gutzkow took courage and proclaimed that to him also this\r\nantiquated pastoral and cloistral Romanticism was an abomination.\r\nIn an essay entitled _Goethe, Uhland, und Prometheus_ he made a\r\nviolent attack on those poets who sought and \"found their creed in\r\ntheir certificates of baptism, their morals in conventionality, their\r\nprinciples in established custom, and their poetry in the poetry of\r\nother people.\" What have you to offer us? he cried. Evening walks in\r\nthe setting sun. Where is your effort to keep pace with the times?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the reaction against the Revolution of July was in full\r\nprogress everywhere. The policy of Prussia, as well as that of Austria,\r\nwas controlled by Metternich; and when the youth of Germany began to\r\nunderstand on what side the power and the energy were, and probably\r\nwould be for long to come, they went over to that side. Gutzkow says,\r\nthat out of every hundred students at the University of Berlin at that\r\ntime, ninety-seven were strong Conservatives; and every meeting with an\r\nold school or college companion, more especially if he happened to be a\r\ncivil servant or an officer, left a most painful impression on his mind.\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances it often happens that high-spirited, able young\r\nmen lose their heads and commit rash actions for which they are blamed\r\nall their lives.\r\n\r\nSchleiermacher was dead, laid to rest with great ceremonial, mourned\r\nas a father of the Protestant Church, one of the saints of theology.\r\nIt had long ago been said, and well said, of him, that his character\r\nanswered to his name (Schleiermacher = veilmaker). By dint of\r\nambiguities and uncertain utterances he had kept himself popular to the\r\nend of his days. No one had brought up against him that Romantic sin of\r\nhis youth, the _Vertrauliche Briefe um Lucinde_ (\"Confidential Letters\r\non the Subject of Lucinde.\")\r\n\r\nBut now Gutzkow, who erroneously concluded that this forgotten book\r\nwould be omitted from the edition of Schleiermacher's works then in\r\npreparation, could not resist the temptation to republish it, and to\r\ndefend himself and his friends against the perpetual accusations of\r\ngodless immorality by showing that their erotic views, and even their\r\ndoctrine of the rehabilitation of the flesh, had been held by that man\r\nof God who was the revered lord and master of the theologians.\r\n\r\nThis might have been a good tactical move if the youth, for he was\r\nstill only twenty-three, had not written a foolish, boyish preface to\r\nthe book. In it he addresses himself to the \"watchmen of Zion,\" scoffs\r\nat their sanctimoniousness and spiritual coquetry, and thus adjures\r\nthem:--\"For one moment cast your priestly robes from you, forget that\r\na man whom you still perpetually crucify was God, and listen to what\r\nhappened once on a time elsewhere, in the world of liberty, youth, and\r\nfancy!\"\r\n\r\nWhat had happened was the publication of Schlegel's _Lucinde_, that\r\nlewd skeleton, which in Gutzkow's eyes is glorious and classic, and of\r\nSchleiermacher's letters about it, which in Gutzkow's estimation are\r\ndivine. The Letters speak for themselves. They absurdly over-estimate\r\n_Lucinde_, but the genuine human feeling in them is beautiful and\r\ncourageous. In Gutzkow's preface everything is emphasised in a\r\ndisagreeably defiant manner. He avers that love is of the nature of\r\ngenius, maintains that priestly action neither adds to nor takes from\r\nthe sacredness of marriage, tauntingly declaims against the cold\r\nprose of the ordinary marriage, \"the water-soup weddings, the sordid\r\nprocreation of children and struggle for mouldy bread.\" He winds up\r\nflippantly with: \"Now tell me truly, Rosalie! Is it not since you\r\nhave worn spurs on your little silk boots, since I have taught you\r\nhow to throw your cloak over your shoulder, since I have invented a\r\nnew sort of inexpressibles for you, so that every one takes you to be\r\nmy youngest, dearly loved brother, is it not since then that you know\r\nwhat I meant by: I love you?\" And not content with this female wearer\r\nof breeches, who is the realisation of his idea of the emancipation\r\nof woman, Gutzkow last of all plays out an atheistic trump; \"Where is\r\nFranz?--Come here, dear boy. I know they baptized you secretly. Who is\r\nGod? What! you don't know, you innocent atheist, you philosophic child!\r\nOh, if the world too had only not known about God, how much happier it\r\nwould have been!\"\r\n\r\nNo specially acute critical faculty is needed to detect the unreality\r\nin this student's braggadocio. The original of the Rosalie who was to\r\nfollow Gutzkow about in page's dress was more probably the Kaled of\r\nByron's _Lara_ than any Heidelberg or Berlin seamstress. It is easy to\r\nimagine what effect such a preface to such a book would produce on the\r\ngeneral public and on orthodox journalism.\r\n\r\nOnly a drop was needed to fill the cup of public indignation, and\r\nthat drop Gutzkow did not fail to add. In 1835 he wrote _Wally, die\r\nZweiflerin_ (\"The Sceptic\"), which is an exceedingly weak story, with a\r\npositively burlesque crucial episode, but which nevertheless influenced\r\nthe course of events more powerfully than any other German literary\r\nwork of the day.\r\n\r\nStrauss's _Life of Jesus_ had lately come out, and its resolution of\r\nthe historical element in that life into myths, bold and fanciful to\r\nthe verge of folly as the hypothesis was, had violently perturbed the\r\nthinking minds of Germany. Indignation was universal. A thousand-voiced\r\ncry of condemnation rose from the Eider to Switzerland. For many a\r\nyear, in the public mind, there was a dark stain on the name of David\r\nStrauss.\r\n\r\nThe book was talked about everywhere, and Gutzkow one evening began to\r\ndiscuss its problem with a young girl to whom he was attached. \"Don't\r\nlet us talk about that,\" she said, \"the very thought drives me mad!\"\r\nThese words made a strong impression on him.\r\n\r\nStrauss's book itself had not satisfied him. Rationalist as he was, he\r\nfelt the need for a historic Jesus, and betook himself to the study of\r\nReimarus's old _Wolfenbüttel Fragments_, to which Lessing before him\r\nhad devoted so much attention. He determined to publish a selection\r\nfrom these, but it was in vain that he applied with this intention to\r\nthe most courageous of the German publishers, Campe. In spite of his\r\nbold political attitude, Campe dared not expose himself to the rancour\r\nof the Hamburg clergy, Pastor Goetze's successors in the cure of souls.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the noble Charlotte Stieglitz committed\r\nsuicide. The impression produced by this tragic event combined itself\r\nin Gutzkow's mind with the impressions made by his young friend's\r\nremark and by Reimarus's Biblical criticism--and _Wally, the Sceptic_,\r\nwas the result.\r\n\r\nIt is a childish book, this _Wally_, but it is innocent, honest, and\r\nartless. The heroine is a young lady moving in good society, who, in\r\ndespair at not being able to overcome the religious doubts awakened\r\nin her mind by the man she loves, the sceptical, _blasé_ Cæsar, kills\r\nherself with a dagger.\r\n\r\nGutzkow had been unable to withstand the temptation of reminding the\r\nvenerable lights and defenders of the Church, the dignitaries of all\r\nthe different classes of the Order of the Red Eagle, that there had\r\nonce lived men named Hume, Voltaire, Lessing, &c. There was something\r\nfascinating to a young man in the idea of reminding such grand folks of\r\nsuch forgotten existences. But it ought to have been done with talent.\r\nIn Gutzkow's novel the plot was a mere excuse for ventilating theories,\r\n_Wally_ was a weak imitation of _Lélia_, the last novel which George\r\nSand had published.\r\n\r\nBut its author was in the spring-tide of his youth. It seemed to him\r\nas if the whole world were growing young again. The glow of Hegel's\r\nsinking sun still illuminated the horizon, Bettina arose like a morning\r\nstar, the ever-young wisdom of Rahel was scattered abroad over the\r\nearth after her death like fruitful dew, Lenau's and Rückert's early\r\npoems were like the song of the lark, Ruge's first critical articles\r\nand Feuerbach's first philosophic writings were like fresh spring\r\nbreezes that cleared the air--the time seemed to him so sunny, so\r\npromising, so laden with fruit, that it was as it were symbolised by\r\nthe two glorious summers of 1834 and 1835, with their rich harvests of\r\ncorn and wine. And it was then he committed his first great youthful\r\nblunder.\r\n\r\nHe was not satisfied with embodying his religious heterodoxy in his\r\nbook; he also proclaimed his moral heterodoxy, his defiance of the\r\naccepted code of sexual morality--a very clumsy and immature defiance.\r\nBut the best idea of how very innocently Gutzkow interpreted that\r\nwatchword, \"the emancipation of the flesh,\" which he himself employs,\r\nis to be gained from the notorious scene in _Wally_, which was intended\r\nby the author to express his worship of beauty.\r\n\r\nWally loves Cæsar and is loved by him, but they cannot marry each\r\nother, because Wally has been obliged to betroth herself to the\r\nSardinian ambassador. Cæsar entreats her that she will as it were\r\nsymbolically celebrate a spiritual marriage with him by showing herself\r\nto him in all her naked beauty the night before her wedding. In an\r\nold German ballad, the heroine, Sigune, thus displays herself to\r\nTchionatulander.\r\n\r\nNo one will deny that Cæsar's request is insane and its fulfilment\r\nridiculous. But the intention of the scene was so chaste and its\r\nexecution so inoffensive, that only positive low-mindedness could have\r\nmade it the occasion of calling for the assistance of the police. We\r\nread; \"The cloak slips from the young hero's shoulders; his hair waves\r\nfreely and luxuriantly. To the left there appears out of the sun-mist\r\nan image of intoxicating beauty--Sigune, displaying herself more\r\nbashfully than the Medicean Venus hides her nakedness. She stands there\r\nhelpless, dazzled by the glamour of the love that besought this favour;\r\nher will is gone; she is the personification of shame, innocence, and\r\nself-abandonment. And in sign that this is a consecrated, holy scene,\r\nno roses bloom, but a high-stemmed lily has shot upwards close to her\r\nbody, symbolically covering her as the flower of chastity. It all\r\nhappened in one breathless, silent moment--it was sacrilege, but the\r\nsacrilege of innocence and of woeful, eternal renunciation.\" This is\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe relations between Gutzkow and Menzel were no longer what they had\r\nbeen. Now and again, in some preface or article, Gutzkow had ventured\r\nto make a small joke at the expense of his former patron, or a modest\r\nprotest against one or other of his utterances. And in a more practical\r\nway Gutzkow had for some time past been a thorn in the side to Menzel.\r\nHis literary supplement to the Frankfort newspaper, _Phoenix_, was a\r\ndangerous rival to Menzel's _Litteraturblatt._ But there was worse than\r\nthis. Gutzkow had gradually got into friendly correspondence with the\r\nleaders of the new literature, Laube, Wienbarg, Mundt, &c, men who were\r\nrapidly taking possession of all the more important literary organs\r\nin Berlin, Leipzig, Frankfort, and Hamburg. When, in 1835, Gutzkow\r\nand Wienbarg issued the prospectus of a literary review in the style\r\nof _Revue des Deux Mondes_, with almost all the most eminent literary\r\nnames in Germany on its list of contributors--university professors\r\nlike Boeckh, influential writers like Varnhagen, not to mention a\r\ntalented author like Börne and a genius like Heine--Menzel felt the\r\nnecessity for striking a telling blow.\r\n\r\nAn invitation to subscribe to the _Deutsche Revue_ had been published.\r\nIt was written by Gutzkow, in flowery, metaphoric language--declares\r\nthat science is longing to escape from musty class-rooms into the free\r\nopen air, that the bird of Minerva is no longer the owl, which is\r\nafraid of the light, but the eagle, which gazes steadfastly into the\r\nsun, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nInstead of confining his attack to this programme, which was\r\ninoffensive and in some respects promising, Menzel, in his\r\n_Litteraturblatt_ of the 11th and 13th September 1835, published a\r\ngeneral manifesto against the company of young authors headed by\r\nKarl Gutzkow. The apology for this action, which he makes as an\r\nold man (in his _Memoirs_, p. 304), shows unquestionable proof of\r\nnarrow-mindedness, but not of any honest conviction. To emphasise\r\nthe cosmopolitan tendencies and French sympathies of Young Germany,\r\nhe wrote of it as \"La jeune Allemagne.\" He directed his principal\r\nattack against _Wally_, from which book he quoted a few disconnected\r\npassages to show that the whole novel was immoral and sacrilegious; the\r\ninsignificant sensual element in the story, the Sigune scene, is made\r\nits main feature.\r\n\r\n\"Only in the deepest mire of immorality, only in brothels, are such\r\natheistic views hatched. They were in vogue among the philosophical\r\nparasites of the old French court. In the Palais Royal they were\r\ntranslated from the language of the court into that of the Jacobins.\r\nHerr Gutzkow has taken it upon himself to transplant once again into\r\nGermany that infamous French ape who, in the arms of a harlot, mocks\r\nat God, but he has done it in an age which, praise be to God, is more\r\nmature and more manly than the age of Voltaire. Even then vice was\r\nfoiled by the natural disposition of our nation; now it will be even\r\nmore impossible for it to effect an entrance. Literature will expel\r\nit, public opinion brand it.... If such a school for the most impudent\r\nimmorality and the most refined falsehood is allowed to establish\r\nitself in Germany, if all the noble minds of the nation do not set\r\nthemselves against it, if German publishers do not beware, but venture\r\nto offer such poison for sale and to praise their wares, we shall soon\r\nsee the result.... But I will tread down your filth, though I know\r\nthat I shall defile myself by doing so; I will bruise the head of the\r\nserpent that warms itself in the hot-bed of sensuality.... As long as\r\nI live, such infamous dishonouring of German literature shall not go\r\nunpunished....\r\n\r\nAnd Menzel, the practical journalist, was not satisfied, like the\r\nordinary author, with saying a thing once for all. He repeated his\r\naccusations in one number after another of his paper with growing\r\nemphasis, more abusive language, more venomous imputations, appealing\r\nmore and more plainly to the State to interfere while it was yet time.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of October he wrote: \"I know that their war against\r\nChristianity, against morality, against marriage is of no more\r\nsignificance than the war of young owls against the old sun. But\r\na spark may give rise to a conflagration.... Upon the new literary\r\njudgment-seat in Frankfurt, Venus vulgivaga will be enthroned in place\r\nof justice ... never will these men, who only believe in the flesh, these\r\npriests of foulness, forgive an author for being purer than they are....\r\nIs it possible to sit still and allow them to propagate French morality\r\namong us by word and deed? Under the mask of French republicanism,\r\nthis libellous, infamous new Frankfurt school is introducing the most\r\nfrightful immorality. The flesh, unbridled sensuality, the abolition\r\nof marriage, are their watchwords, and they not only write obscene\r\nbooks themselves, but serve up the old ones afresh.... They are to a\r\ncertain extent disciples of Saint-Simon, they proclaim a still more\r\ndissolute republicanism, without any virtue, a hetæra-republic on\r\nthe grandest scale.... As yet these principles are confined to the\r\nnarrower, aristocratic circles of literature.... But to what do these\r\ndoctrines appeal but to the bestiality and ferocity which, though they\r\nare still slumbering, would be so easily aroused in the great capitals\r\nand manufacturing towns, with their obscene haunts of drunkenness and\r\ndepravity.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of November Menzel directly denounces the Prussian\r\nuniversity professors who have been rash enough to promise Gutzkow\r\ntheir co-operation in his review: \"Are the universities not State\r\ninstitutions? Does the Prussian State no longer protect Christianity,\r\nmorality, marriage? We have heard so much of the moral, religious,\r\nConservative spirit that prevails in Prussia. Are we now to see the\r\nmost eminent professors of Berlin, Königsberg, and Halle following at\r\nthe heels of an obscene Marat, who, like the real Marat, literally\r\npreaches the sacrament of 'the irresistible moment' and a republic of\r\nsans-culottes and sans-chemises? Are we to hear them raving with him\r\nagainst Christianity, morality, marriage, the family, modesty, against\r\nGod and immortality, against German nationality and the established\r\norder of things?\" And he concluded his outburst by applying the\r\ndesignation of a Jewish party to the good Germans, Gutzkow, Wienbarg,\r\nLaube, Mundt, and Kühne, because of their sympathy with the ideas of\r\nBörne and Heine. Young Germany, he declared, was in reality Young\r\nPalestine.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this denunciation, Karl Gutzkow was arrested on\r\na charge of blasphemy and lewd writing, and Menzel was dishonourable\r\nenough to go on exciting public indignation against him whilst he was\r\nin confinement and the case was being tried at Mannheim. The sentence\r\npronounced was, however, only ten weeks' imprisonment for attacking the\r\nexisting religious institutions of Baden.\r\n\r\nBut fear of the revolutionary movements which Menzel maintained would\r\nbe the result of the teaching of Young Germany, induced the German\r\nConfederation to take action, and on the 10th of December 1835 the\r\nFederal Diet passed a resolution, which aimed at nothing less than\r\nthe annihilation of the whole group of authors, young and old, which\r\nit comprehends under the designation Young Germany. It reads as\r\nfollows: \"In view of the fact that a school of literature has lately\r\ncome into existence in Germany, a school now known by the name of\r\n'Young Germany,' or 'the young literature,' whose aim is, by means of\r\nbelletristic writings, accessible to all classes of readers, impudently\r\nto attack the Christian religion, to discredit the existing conditions\r\nof society, and to subvert all discipline and morality, the Council\r\nof the German Confederation (Bundesversammlung) ... has unanimously\r\npassed the following resolutions: (1) All the German Governments bind\r\nthemselves to bring the penal and police statutes of their respective\r\ncountries and the regulations regarding the abuse of the press in their\r\nstrictest sense to bear against the authors, publishers, printers, and\r\ndisseminators of the writings of the literary school known as 'Young\r\nGermany' or 'the young literature,' to which notably belong Heinrich\r\nHeine, Karl Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube, Ludolf Wienbarg, and Theodor\r\nMundt, as also by all lawful means to prevent the dissemination of the\r\nwritings of this school by booksellers, lending libraries, or other\r\nmeans,\" &c., &c.\r\n\r\nIt was in this manner that the appellation Young Germany first became\r\nfamiliar to the general public. It was the German Police-Confederation\r\nwhich, constituting itself a critical authority, stigmatised a group of\r\nauthors, mentioned by name, as an immoral and injurious \"school\"--and\r\nthis on the information of one single rival of these men in the favour\r\nof the reading public.\r\n\r\nMenzel was to Young Germany what Southey in his day was to the\r\n\"Satanic school\" in English literature, _alias_ Byron and Shelley,\r\nor Katkóf, a generation later, to the \"traitorous school\" in Russian\r\nliterature--Herzen, Ogarev, and Bakunin. In disturbed times the\r\ninformer is as necessary an appendage to the foreground figures as the\r\nenvious rival and spy was to the hero of the old tragedies.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Ludwig Geiger: _Das junge Deutschland und die preussische\r\nCensur_. Berlin, 1900.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Wundersam ist es, wie sich diese Herrlein einen gewissen\r\nsittig-religiös-poetischen Bettlermantel so geschickt umzuschlagen\r\nwissen, dass, wenn auch der Ellenbogen herausguckt, man diesen Mangel\r\nfür eine poetische Intention halten muss.\"\r\n\r\nThe fellows manage to throw a kind of moral-religious-poetic beggar's\r\ncloak so cleverly round them, that, even if the bare elbow shows, we\r\nare obliged to consider this defect a poetic intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nGUTZKOW, LAUBE, MUNDT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe determination of the Federal Council to suppress the writings\r\nof Young Germany not only nipped the _Deutsche Revue_ in the bud,\r\nbut also put an end to the existence of Mundt's _Litterarischer\r\nZodiacus_, published in Leipzig, and prevented the publication of\r\nLaube's _Mitternachtszeitung_, which was to have appeared in Brunswick.\r\nImmediately after Menzel's first attack on Gutzkow and his friends,\r\nMundt, with the valour of the prudent man, had written a series of\r\nsevere articles against Heine, Gutzkow, and Wienbarg--but all to no\r\npurpose; his fate was sealed.\r\n\r\nIt seemed for a time as if the resolution were intended not only to\r\naffect everything that the proscribed authors had already written, but\r\neverything that they might write in the future.\r\n\r\nAn edict of the Prussian Government, dated 11th December 1835,\r\nexpressly provides that \"the _future_ literary productions of Heinrich\r\nHeine, wherever they may be published and in whatever language, are\r\nto be subject to the same regulations as the writings of Gutzkow,\r\nWienbarg, Laube, and Mundt.\" And not only was every possible measure\r\ntaken to silence the obnoxious authors, but (as in Russia, when a man\r\nis in disgrace with the Government) it was made illegal, even for those\r\nwho desired to write disparagingly of them, to print their names.\r\nMundt's name was erased from the list of contributors to the _Berliner\r\nJahrbücher für wissenschaftliche Kritik_, and in the announcements of\r\nVarnhagen and Mundt's edition of Knebel's _Literary Remains_, Varnhagen\r\nalone might be named as editor.\r\n\r\nExcessively strict precautions were at the same time taken with\r\nregard to foreign publications. A few inoffensive English and French\r\nnewspapers were countenanced. In the case of all the others the\r\nexpedient was resorted to of requiring the same postage to be paid for\r\nthem as for letters, thereby raising the cost of such papers to at\r\nleast 500 thalers (£75) per annum.[1]\r\n\r\nTo the leaders of Young Germany the Government thus offered the\r\ncompulsory choice between biding their time in defiant silence and\r\npurchasing other conditions for themselves by disowning their past\r\nand making humiliating promises for the future. No one who has\r\nhad any experience of the average valour of the denizens of the\r\nliterary world can feel surprised that few stood this test, that many\r\naccepted the second alternative. Neither Heine, Wienbarg, nor Gutzkow\r\ngave in; but many others made pitiable exhibitions of themselves.\r\nCrowds of the young authors who had plumed themselves upon their\r\nrevolutionary-philosophical, their oppositionist-political ideas, now\r\nhastened to prove their philosophic commonplaceness, their political\r\ninnocuousness. The name \"Young Germany\" had been an honourable name;\r\nbut now that those who had borne it found themselves the objects of\r\nspecial police surveillance, they refused to acknowledge it, each\r\ndeclaring that he, at least, did not belong to the party, and that if\r\nhe ever had done so, it was an old story, and he had since then become\r\na most respectable member of society. In this case, as so often, it\r\nwas proved that modern high-class education only provides desultory\r\nknowledge, does not form character, and least of all amongst those who\r\nmake their living by their pens.\r\n\r\nAugust Lewald, who to all intents and purposes belonged to the group,\r\nprocured the annulment of the prohibition of his periodical, _Europa_,\r\nby making a declaration that he had never printed anything inimical\r\nto the Government, to religion, or to morality, and was consequently\r\nin no wise compromised by any of the mischievous proceedings of Young\r\nGermany. Eduard Duller, who had been co-editor with Gutzkow of the\r\npaper, _Phoenix_, publicly disclaimed all sympathy with the aims of\r\nYoung Germany and declared his principles to be perfectly different\r\nfrom those of his former fellow-workers. Theodor Mundt professed\r\nthat he had always kept clear of \"that manufactured category,\" Young\r\nGermany, as it was plain that such an appellation must sooner or later\r\nbecome a literary nickname (Ekelname); and in the preface to his\r\nnew periodical, _Dioskuren für Wissenschaft und Kunst_, he declared\r\nthat his aim was to counteract the literary excesses of recent times\r\nby the display of a settled conviction devoid of any principle of\r\ndestructiveness (_worin nichts Verheerendes wuchert_).\r\n\r\nMeekest of all, perhaps, was Heinrich Laube, he who had been the most\r\ndaring and defiant of the Young Germans, he whom Heine had called \"one\r\nof those gladiators who die in the arena\"--an appreciation which now\r\nseemed somewhat ridiculous. He affirmed, in the _Allgemeine Zeitung_,\r\nthat in promising Dr. Gutzkow to contribute to his new review, he had\r\nnever dreamt of aiding and abetting the party known by the name of\r\nYoung Germany in its attacks on the existing conditions of society,\r\nmuch less in its attempts to disturb and overturn them. On the\r\ncontrary, he had from the first plainly signified that he did not\r\nidentify himself with the movement.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's day, 1836, in the announcement of his\r\n_Mitternachtszeitung_, which he had obtained permission to publish\r\non condition that his name did not appear as editor, he wrote that\r\nhe had become another man, that literature was no longer to him an\r\nexpression of political desires, that it was not his intention to take\r\nany part in the literary disputes of the moment, \"the rough-and-tumble\r\nfights with uncombed hair and unwashed hands\"; no, it had long been\r\nhis idea to form \"a neo-Romantic school,\" and in it he would have no\r\ndisintegrating, destructive elements. He would support the existing,\r\nnot make war upon it. He would not identify himself with Menzel\r\n(actually!) but neither could he take part with the so-called Young\r\nGermany. He who had been the most daring of them all was the quickest\r\nand most adroit in wheeling round.\r\n\r\nDay after day, too, as was to be expected, the newspapers contained\r\ndeclarations by the different university professors who had been\r\nincautious enough to promise their co-operation in the _Deutsche\r\nRevue_. Ulrici, Eduard Gans, Hotho, Rosenkranz and Trendelenburg,\r\nHegelians and Anti-Hegelians, all, one after the other, cleared\r\nthemselves from the charge of complicity. They repented with their\r\nofficial souls. They vied with each other in their utter repudiation of\r\nGutzkow.\r\n\r\nHeine did not belong to the number of those who lose their courage or\r\ntheir heads in a difficulty. And in any case, partly because of his\r\nestablished reputation, partly because of the personal security ensured\r\nby his residence abroad, this interdict was not such a serious blow\r\nto him as to the others. On the 28th of January 1836, after receiving\r\nintimation of the prohibition of his books, he addressed a solemn\r\nprotest to the Federal Diet, a proceeding about which he immediately\r\nafterwards jokes in a private letter to his publisher. In this protest\r\nhe expresses his astonishment at having been judged without a trial,\r\nand without having been given any opportunity to defend himself. He\r\nreminds the Federal Diet that Martin Luther did not meet with such\r\ntreatment at the hands of the Holy Roman Empire--not that he would\r\nthink of comparing himself with Luther, \"but the pupil naturally\r\nappeals to the precedent of his master.\" But what he especially desires\r\nto protest against is his compulsory silence (which he was privately\r\ndetermined to break as soon as possible) being taken for an admission\r\nof culpable intentions, or even for a disavowal of his earlier\r\nwritings. To Laube, of whose new attitude he was still ignorant, he\r\nwrote about the same time that, in the matter of politics, it was, for\r\nthe present, allowable to make any number of concessions, political\r\nforms being of no consequence as long as the conflict for the highest\r\nlife-principles was still going on; but they must hold to their right\r\nof free discussion of religious and moral topics, or there would soon\r\nbe an end of all Protestant liberty of thought. Laube, as we know,\r\nfinding himself obliged to give in to a certain extent, gave in all\r\nround at once, struck simultaneously his political, religious, and\r\nmoral flags.\r\n\r\nIt was a slight consolation to the sufferers that the informer did not\r\ngo unpunished. Heine wrote _Ueber den Denunzianten_ and Börne wrote\r\n_Menzel der Franzosenfresser_ (\"The Frenchman-eater\"), which is with\r\nreason regarded as his wittiest and at the same time most warm-hearted\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nBut the more severe punishment came from Heine, who threw himself upon\r\nhis victim with all his tiger-like strength, and shook him till there\r\nwas nothing left of him but a shapeless, ridiculous bundle.\r\n\r\nHeine points out how carefully Menzel has chosen the time for making\r\nhis accusations, a time when the leaders of the movement were either in\r\nexile, or silent, or in safe keeping behind bolts and bars. He exposes\r\nMenzel's hypocrisy, showing how, as long as he was connected with\r\nGutzkow, he looked on silently, though he knew Christianity to be in\r\nperil of its life. He is quite ready to give him credit for \"a certain\r\nphysical morality\"--for a man can be virtuous alone, but to be vicious\r\nhe must have a companion. Herr Menzel's personal appearance stands him\r\nin good stead when he is desirous to flee from vice. Heine has far\r\ntoo high an opinion of the good taste of vice to be able to believe\r\nthat it would run after a Menzel. Poor Goethe was not so fortunately\r\ngifted in this particular. Of Menzel's political opinions Heine is\r\nafraid to speak for political reasons. Nor can he say what he thinks of\r\nhis private life (as if by a printer's error _Privatschelmenleben_ is\r\nsubstituted for _Privatmenschenleben_) in the first instance for want\r\nof space.\r\n\r\nNever did Heine write anything at once so insulting and so crushing.\r\n\r\nAnd how did matters stand with Gutzkow, who at the early age of\r\ntwenty-four had become a kind of centre of literary events, and upon\r\nwhom \"the Goliath of the Philistine army\" had fallen? For a moment he\r\nwas astonished and cast down. It was his first instructive experience\r\nof life. His sin was that he had expressed his feelings naïvely and\r\nhonestly in a second-rate novel, and its result was that he now found\r\nhimself denounced as a plague of society, mocked at by his enemies,\r\nforsaken and disowned by his friends. With perfect calm he heard\r\nhimself compared to the men who had prepared for the enormities\r\nperpetrated at Minister under Jan van Leyden--division of property,\r\nmarriage with twelve wives, &c. He was inexperienced enough to look\r\nforward to the legal proceedings against him with expectations of\r\nvictory, and when he was arrested at Mannheim, he went to prison\r\nwith a feeling of relief. In prison he did not hear the yelling of\r\nthe press; he heard nothing but the squeaking of the mice that ran\r\nover his bed. He could lead a peaceful life, a life of uninterrupted,\r\nquiet production. He wrote his novel _Seraphine_ and a work entitled\r\n_Philosophic der That und des Ereignisses_ (\"Philosophy of Action\r\nand Event\"), a kind of criticism of Hegel's _Philosophy of History_.\r\nWhen he came out of prison he took up his life-work again with firm\r\ndetermination, but for a time wrote anonymously and expressed himself\r\nmore cautiously.\r\n\r\nAbout a year before this he had fallen in love with a young girl in\r\nBerlin, and become engaged to her. But the Berlin newspapers called him\r\nan atheist. The young lady's mother was a foolish, hysterical woman.\r\nOne day she would embrace Gutzkow, the next threaten to throw a knife\r\nat him and shriek to her daughter, \"Choose between him and me!\" As the\r\nwisdom of allowing her daughter to unite her fate with Gutzkow's became\r\nmore and more questionable, the mother's amiable days became fewer, the\r\nunamiable more frequent, and in the end the young lady, as an obedient\r\ndaughter, drew back altogether. This episode had made a tremendous\r\nimpression on Gutzkow's young heart. It had taught him that to hold\r\nconvictions contrary to those of the people one lives amongst isolates\r\na man even in private life, and that he who sets the opinion of his\r\nneighbours at defiance cannot expect to be successful in life or in\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nHis friends behaved no better to him. No sooner was he released from\r\nprison than he was overwhelmed with reproaches and complaints by\r\npersons to whom he had previously promised literary employment, and who\r\nwere now not only disappointed in their hopes, but compromised by the\r\npatronage he had extended to them.\r\n\r\nHis first disappointment in love led to one of his best shorter\r\nstories, _Der Sadducäer von Amsterdam_. And the disappointment,\r\ncombined with the general disillusionment, produced the frame\r\nof mind which characterises the dramatised version of the story\r\nwhich he published many years later under the title of _Uriel\r\nAcosta_--undoubtedly his best drama, probably his best work.\r\n\r\nThe hero is a historic personage, Gabriel, afterwards Uriel Acosta,\r\nborn in 1594, a religious philosopher of Jewish nationality. His\r\nparents were baptised Christians, but he himself, on account of his\r\ndisbelief in Christianity, was obliged to leave his native land,\r\nPortugal, and take refuge in Holland. Then he threw in his lot with the\r\nJews, but soon began to publish works in which the Jewish doctrines\r\nwere as freely criticised as the Christian. For this he was condemned\r\nto pay fines, and in the end was sentenced to a most humiliating\r\npenance. After public acknowledgment and recantation of his errors,\r\nhe was to lie on the ground at the threshold of the synagogue and\r\nallow himself to be trodden under foot by the whole congregation of\r\nthe faithful. After seven years of persecution he submitted to the\r\nsentence, but immediately afterwards, in despair at having retracted\r\nhis opinions, shot himself (in 1647). He was the forerunner, and, if we\r\nmay believe tradition, the teacher of Spinoza.\r\n\r\nIn the little old-fashioned story, _Der Sadducäer von Amsterdam_, the\r\nmost important personages of the future drama are outlined. Judith, the\r\nvacillating and finally faithless woman, beloved of Acosta, was very\r\nevidently suggested by the inconstant Berlin lady. The style is artless\r\nand weak. Spinoza is introduced as follows: \"She called, and her only\r\nchild, a boy of seven, came running up to his uncle, whom he easily\r\nrecognised in the moonlight. Bare your heads! That boy was Baruch\r\nSpinoza!\"\r\n\r\nWhat attracted Gutzkow as a young man to this theme was evidently its\r\npathos, its being the story of the first martyr for free-thought.\r\n\r\nIn our days we read of such a life without being remarkably impressed\r\nby it. The spiritually emancipated know that all the advance that\r\nhas been made amounts to this, that they are now tolerated. The life\r\nthat they have lived has so accustomed them to hear all that they\r\nhold highest condemned, and all that they regard as base or foolish\r\nextolled, that no story of this kind affects them much.\r\n\r\nIt was different with the generation of 1830 in Germany. Even the\r\nfact that Uriel Acosta sued for pardon and recanted did not lessen\r\nGutzkow's interest in him. In the novel he writes: \"We who have been,\r\nas it were, born into a state of constant martyrdom for the sake of\r\nour convictions, who have lived in it all our lives, must refrain from\r\ncondemning a man who had the courage to protest against the dogmas of\r\na fanatical, intolerant religion, but who, nevertheless, was capable\r\nof cringing beneath the hand that had chastised him.\" He depicts the\r\nconfusion in Uriel's soul: Faith is the blind man's staff; his eyes\r\nare suddenly opened; but they are utterly unaccustomed to distinguish\r\nobjects; they cannot, like the staff to which he has been so long\r\naccustomed, save him from falling; and so he gropes more helplessly\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nAfter the storm raised by Menzel had passed in all its fury over\r\nGutzkow's head, the story of Acosta inevitably acquired quite a new\r\nsignificance for him. Considering it now, he saw not only its purely\r\ndramatic possibilities, but the correspondence of its main features\r\nwith the main features of his own life story. He, too, had been\r\nplaced under ban and interdict; he, too, after being cursed, had been\r\ndeserted; he, too, had paid the penalty of intrepid thought; he, too,\r\nhad been flung on the ground before the threshold of the injured\r\nChurch, and the whole multitude had passed over him and trampled on him.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, in Paris, under the influence of the acting of great\r\ntragedians, Gutzkow dramatised the story. He made various alterations\r\nin it. To increase the interest of the plot, he idealised the chief\r\nfemale character. In the tragedy of _Uriel Acosta_, Judith is the\r\nbetrothed of another; Uriel is her master. But when the Rabbis, with\r\nsolemn ceremony, pronounced the terrible curse, when all draw back from\r\nhim and he is left alone on one side of the stage, whilst the words:\r\n\r\n               \"Fluch dem Freund\r\n    Der Dir im Elend je die Treue hält!\r\n    Nie giebt sich Dir ein liebend Herz des Weibes,\"[2]\r\n\r\nare being spoken, she crosses the stage and places herself by his side\r\nwith the famous and beautiful speech ending with the line:\r\n\r\n   \"Er _wird_ geliebt! Glaubt besseren Propheten!\"[3]\r\n\r\nOf a personage who hardly appears at all in the novel, Gutzkow made\r\nan imperishable character, the best and most original in the drama,\r\nthe aged Chief Rabbi, Ben Akiba. This old man has in reality only one\r\nconclusive speech, which he repeats again and again to Uriel and to the\r\nothers:\r\n\r\n    \"Es war alles da.\"\r\n    (This has all been before.)\r\n\r\nAdmirable words! Ben Akiba is age, that has seen all these things\r\nbefore, seen the Church attacked, seen the Church triumphant, seen\r\nsceptics and champions arise, seen them humiliated, defeated, dead, and\r\nburied. The others believe that this is something new; it is all old,\r\nit all leads to no result. Ben Akiba is dogmatic conservatism in human\r\nform; he is experience, shaking its heavy head. If youth were to listen\r\nto him, despairing indifference would be the inevitable result.\r\n\r\nUriel lets himself be persuaded to recant. He does it for his mother's\r\nand Judith's sake. His old, blind, believing mother comes to him, and\r\nin a scene which never fails to affect the audience, persuades him to\r\nrecant and submit to the ignominious punishment--persuades only by her\r\nsilent dignity and the strength of her love, without a single entreaty\r\nto do this or anything else for her sake. Uriel takes the step, hoping\r\nthat it will remove a weight from his mother's heart and make it\r\npossible for him to marry Judith. But whilst he is still in prison\r\npreparing for the penance, his mother dies, and Judith is forced to\r\nmarry Ben Jochai. He degrades himself in vain. Judith poisons herself,\r\nand he (the drama in this point keeping to fact) shoots himself.\r\n\r\nBy reason of its theme, the tragedy of _Uriel Acosta_ occupies a\r\nunique place in the German literature of the day. It is a tragedy of\r\nfree-thought, a drama that gives us a better idea than anything else\r\ndoes of the period which produced it--a period of energetic struggle\r\nfor liberty, and of still more energetic oppression--and of the\r\nspirit of that Young Germany which was so gallant in advance, but so\r\nprone to defection and retractation. It is a play, too, which bears\r\nunmistakable testimony to its author's qualities of head and heart. Any\r\none who compares Gutzkow's _Uriel Acosta_ with Heine's _Almansor_, will\r\nsubscribe to the affirmation already made, that the best men of Young\r\nGermany in their best moments displayed a manly earnestness which we do\r\nnot find in Heine.\r\n\r\nOn the German stage _Uriel Acosta_ has now long been a favourite play.\r\nThe pure style and the treatment of the subject remind us of Lessing's\r\n_Nathan der Weise_, but in energy and pathos Gutzkow in this case\r\nsurpasses Lessing. In spite of some weak parts, such as the Spinoza\r\nscene, the dramatic construction is excellent.\r\n\r\nOf all Gutzkow's works, this play has had the widest circulation. It\r\nhas been translated into all the Slavonic and all the Latin languages,\r\ninto English, Hungarian, and Swedish.\r\n\r\nIn Germany it was for a time, as Gutzkow himself aptly remarked, a\r\nsort of barometer indicating the state of public opinion. When the\r\necclesiastical reaction was in the ascendant, it was prohibited in many\r\nof the theatres. When there was a change of system, the prohibition was\r\ncancelled. It is significant that in Austria its performance was always\r\npermitted in the provinces, but that the Concordat with the Pope stood\r\nin the way of its being played in the Burg Theater of Vienna. As was to\r\nbe expected, the play was long in reaching Denmark; it was first played\r\nthere in the Nineties.\r\n\r\nAfter 1835 Gutzkow writes nothing childish or crude. From this time\r\nonwards he is the great, indefatigable literary worker; a student\r\nand critic who possessed the faculty of discerning and explaining\r\nthe relation in which all characters, past or present, stood to the\r\nrequirements and problems of his day; an acute distinguisher of\r\nthe various drifts of the times; a psychologist distinguished for\r\nhis understanding of individual character. His _Goethe_ (1836) is\r\na thoughtful little work, in the first instance a protest against\r\nMenzel; his long series of portraits (_Zeitgenossen_, afterwards\r\n_Säkularbilder_) show qualities which somewhat later stood him in good\r\nstead as a novelist; his _Life of Börne_ (1840) is a tribute to the\r\nmemory of that progenitor of Young Germany and a challenge to Heine,\r\nwhose injudicious and ungenerous work on Börne had lowered him in the\r\nestimation of the young generation.\r\n\r\nA special interest attaches to Gutzkow's dramatic attempts from the\r\nfact that he and Laube were the first German authors of any position\r\nsince the days of Kleist to connect themselves with the theatre and to\r\nwin an honourable place for themselves on the German stage. Gutzkow\r\nmakes a laboured beginning with sentimental dramas that no longer\r\nsatisfy the public taste. His _Richard Savage, oder der Sohn einer\r\nMutter_ (1839) is from beginning to end a high-flown extravaganza. A\r\ntalented English poet, who has grown up in ignorance of his parentage,\r\ndiscovers his mother in a beautiful, brilliant, aristocratic woman\r\nof the world, who refuses to acknowledge him or to have anything\r\nwhatever to do with him. The play is a series of representations of\r\nhis fruitless attempts to win this mother's cold heart. _Werner, oder\r\nHerz und Welt_ (1840), is a pathetic, middle-class drama, turning on\r\na theme on which Gutzkow rang many changes, the struggle in a man's\r\nheart between an old attachment and a more recently formed connection.\r\nHeinrich Werner has allowed himself to be adopted by people in a\r\nposition above his own. He has been ennobled under the name of von\r\nJordan, and has deserted a poor but charming young girl in order to\r\nmarry a lady of position. But in his new, affluent circumstances, he\r\nmisses his former plain, studious life, and, most of all, Marie Winter,\r\nthe girl to whom he had been engaged, and whom he cannot forget. He\r\nsuddenly meets her again as governess in his own house. He is long\r\ndistracted between his duty to his wife and his attraction to this\r\ngirl, whom he is determined to love only platonically, but whom he\r\nreally loves above everything. At last things come to a crisis. The\r\nwife asserts her rights, rights that Heinrich refuses to acknowledge.\r\nHis morality is a higher, a freer than hers. She \"shudders at his\r\nprinciples.\" The knot is finally cut by a _deus ex machinâ_. A young\r\nfriend of Heinrich's comes to an agreement with Marie that he and she\r\nwill marry, and so prevent the breaking up of the family. The tragic\r\nmotive is thus, we observe, deprived of its point.\r\n\r\nThe first of Gutzkow's plays that it still gives one a reasonable\r\namount of pleasure to see is _Zopf und Schwert_ (\"Pigtail and Sword\"),\r\nwritten in 1843. It is a play which has kept its place on the German\r\nstage, but which never gained a firm footing outside of Germany\r\nfrom the fact of its being a species of national drama. The beat of\r\na Prussian's heart is felt in it. Gutzkow's aim was to represent\r\nFrederick William I. and his court in a comedy like those which\r\nScribe was bringing out so successfully about the same time. The\r\nhistoric appreciation is, however, far from being so superficial as\r\nin Scribe's comedies. Gutzkow had an eye for the admirable as well as\r\nfor the comical qualities of the miserly family tyrant, the monarch of\r\nSpartan severity. But the very fact of the play being a comedy made a\r\nreally profound study of the character an impossibility. And it was\r\nnot Gutzkow's habit, and still less was it Laube's, to investigate\r\ninto historical characters and situations until they arrived at the\r\nhistoric, as opposed to the traditional truth. Their history was simply\r\nthe vehicle of a more or less cleverly concocted plot. We have only to\r\nopen the first volume of Carlyle's _Frederick the Great_ to find such\r\nan immensely more powerful and impressive picture of the eccentric\r\nPrussian king with his tall grenadiers, that Gutzkow's in comparison\r\nshrinks into a mild pleasantry. And we have only to look at a few\r\npages of the Memoirs of Gutzkow's heroine, Wilhelmine of Bayreuth,\r\nto see that in the relations between her and her father there was no\r\nsuggestion of comedy. But, putting aside all thought of historical\r\ncorrectness, we have a very pretty intrigue-play, with a historic\r\ncolouring which cannot fail to appeal to lovers of Prussia. _Zopf und\r\nSchwert_ is a species of light-hearted pendant to Kleist's serious\r\n_Prins von Homburg_.\r\n\r\nOf the other plays written by Gutzkow in the Forties, _Das Urbild des\r\nTartüffe_ (\"The Prototype of Tartuffe\") has been the most successful,\r\nbut it is a much over-estimated work. A very charming little work\r\nis _Der Königslieutenant_, an unassuming play, written for Goethe's\r\ncentenary, and treating of him in his youthful days.\r\n\r\nThe long historical novels, _Die Ritter vom Geist_ (\"The Knights of\r\nthe Spirit\"), _Der Zauberer von Rom_ (\"The Roman Magician\"), &c,\r\nwhich Gutzkow wrote during the reaction period after 1848, and which\r\nimmensely strengthened his hold over the minds of his contemporaries,\r\ndo not come within the scope of the present work. They were the\r\nforerunners of Spielhagen's long series of novels.\r\n\r\nNext to Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube (born in Sprottau, in Silesia, in\r\n1806) was the most eminent member of the new group. He is a clear-cut\r\ntype, a man with plenty of fresh, vigorous talent, exuberant spirits,\r\nan intuitive perception of what is effective, a gift of slight, but\r\nin most instances adequate character delineation, and, to start with,\r\nmany daring but shallow and second-hand ideas. He is not devoid of\r\nfeeling, nor totally devoid of earnestness, but his distinguishing\r\nquality is his brisk, energetic practicalness. Between 1826 and 1832\r\nhe studied theology at Halle and Breslau. In 1832 he embarked on the\r\ncareer of a journalist in Leipzig. In his unpedantic literary style,\r\nas also in his outward appearance, there was something that seemed\r\nto point to Slavonic blood in his veins. As a student he loved to go\r\nabout in a Polish braided coat, and eccentric caps and cloaks of his\r\nown invention. He wrote with a fluency and vehemence, with a crude\r\nnaturalness and a want of exactitude which were not German. His blood\r\nwas hot and flowed quickly; he had the sanguine, choleric temperament,\r\nwithout a touch of melancholy.\r\n\r\nAs a member of a student's union (Burschenschaft) and because he\r\nhad given too free expression to his sympathy with the Revolution\r\nof July and its results in Germany, he was, in 1834, expelled from\r\nSaxony and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment in Berlin. In the\r\nintroduction to his drama, _Monaldeschi_, we find an account of his\r\nlife in prison, of the monotony of that beautiful summer of 1834, which\r\nhe spent in his cell, without a book--nothing but a bed, a table, a\r\nstool, and a pitcher of water. He also gives an indirect and more\r\neffective description of the same experience in the Third Part of _Das\r\njunge Europa_, where Valerius, upon scraps of paper procured with the\r\ngreatest difficulty, writes his impressions during a long confinement\r\nin a Prussian prison.\r\n\r\nWe know what his conduct was after the Federal Council had prohibited\r\nhis writings as belonging to the Young German school; but to judge\r\nhim fairly we must remember that this blow came upon him immediately\r\nafter his release, and that, in spite of his subsequent cautious\r\nbehaviour, he was again, soon after his marriage in 1837, condemned to\r\nimprisonment for participation in the doings of the Burschenschaften.\r\nThis time the punishment was mild, thanks apparently to the protection\r\nof Prince Pückler-Muskau. The place of imprisonment was a country\r\nhouse on the Prince's property of Muskau; for a cell he was given a\r\nhall; instead of a skylight he had eight windows, looking in three\r\ndifferent directions. Even a short daily walk in the famous park was\r\npermitted. He might read and write as much as he chose. His wife shared\r\nhis imprisonment. From this time onwards he shows extreme moderation\r\nin politics. When, in 1848, he is elected a member of the German\r\nNational Assembly, he sides, not with the republican, but with the\r\n\"hereditary-imperial\" party.\r\n\r\nLaube makes his début in literature as a disciple of Heine. His\r\n_Reisenovellen_, a long series of volumes, are the direct offspring of\r\nthe _Reisebilder_. But along with the influence of Heine we trace that\r\nof Heinse. From Heine Laube takes liveliness and ingenuity of style,\r\nand also to a certain extent the personal coxcombry by which we are\r\nsometimes very unpleasantly affected; but it is from Wilhelm Heinse,\r\nfor whom he had an extreme admiration, and whose works he edited,\r\nthat he derives the undisguised sensualism which displays itself\r\nin a positive cult of woman's outward charms constantly and loudly\r\nproclaimed. In Heinse's case this worship of female form and colouring,\r\nthis adoration of the fleshly, is more primitive, more naïvely\r\nBacchanalian, more sincerely religious, than in Laube's. Laube at times\r\noffends by coarseness, at times by an almost personal boastfulness of\r\nwoman-killing qualities, and at times it is too perceptible that he is\r\nwriting for the purpose of annoying his respectable neighbours.\r\n\r\nWhen, in his old age, he began to republish his youthful works, the new\r\ngeneration were astounded by the breaches of good taste which youthful\r\nreaders some forty years before had admired, and many assented to the\r\nsevere judgment which had lately been passed on him by Emil Kuh in the\r\nchapter on Young Germany contained in his book on Hebbel. But it is\r\nunfair to allow a little coarseness and want of taste here and there to\r\nkeep us from estimating Laube's work in its integrity.\r\n\r\nIn the _Reisenovellen_, in spite of the off-hand way in which they\r\nare written, there is little originality. At the very beginning,\r\nin the division entitled _Leipzig_, with its French sympathies and\r\nits reverence of Napoleon, there is too strong a suggestion of the\r\n_Reisebilder_. Laube, like Heine, in his childhood saw the great\r\nEmperor; so he gives us to understand, but in such an uncertain manner\r\nthat we are left in doubt as to whether it was in a dream or in\r\nreality; and Laube, too, has--in the person of Gardy the dragoon--his\r\ndrummer Legrand.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to get a real, full impression of what Laube was as\r\na young man, ought to read his novel, _Das junge Europa_ (4 vols.\r\n1833-37). A whole, long stage of his development is placed clearly\r\nbefore us in this now pardonably forgotten book, which retains its\r\ninterest only for the historian. Its three parts--the Poets, The\r\nSoldiers, The Citizens--are three works differing very much from each\r\nother in kind and in quality.\r\n\r\nIn the First Part the author is completely under the influence of\r\nHeinse's _Ardinghello_. \"The Poets\" is a sort of prose hymn to female\r\nbeauty and free love, in the old-fashioned form of a novel in letters,\r\nwhich communicate the love fates of about a dozen people. When the\r\nreader has struggled through them, there is left on his mind an\r\nimpression of the wild ecstatic desire of young, vigorous, hopeful\r\nmen, and of the resolute self-surrender of young and daring or tender\r\nwomen, the impression of a generation in whose veins glows a desire for\r\nliberty--political, social, erotic--which breaks down all forms and\r\nall conventions. We see into an imaginary, romantic world, the world\r\nof Laube's youthful dreams, where there is abundance of power and of\r\nlife, and of illusions as to the renovation of the world by means of\r\nrevolutions of various kinds. It is a romance of beautiful bodies and\r\nbeautiful souls, male and female, the essence of whose being is revolt\r\nagainst Christianity and against marriage.\r\n\r\nBetween the First and the Second Part, a considerable change has\r\nevidently come over the author's views; he has received his impression\r\nof the strength of the reaction; he has ripened into a man. In the\r\nFirst Part one could hardly help mixing up the characters, for the\r\nmen were only distinguished from each other by their more or less\r\nfiery, erotic, uncontrollable temperaments, the woman only by the\r\ndissimilarity of their physical charms; in the Second Part we are\r\nintroduced into a world where a real struggle for national and\r\npolitical liberty is going on. The letter form is abandoned, and there\r\nare comparatively few characters.\r\n\r\nIt is the revolt of Poland which is described; Valerius, one of the\r\nprincipal characters in the First Part, is led by his enthusiasm\r\nfor liberty in general to join the Poles. The subject-matter is\r\ninteresting, though here and there we have too much of the purely\r\nhistorical. The Poles as a people are described impartially and with\r\na sure touch; their characteristics--the strong patriotic feeling\r\ninspiring high and low, the prejudices and tyranny of the nobility, the\r\nsavagery and vigour of the lower classes--are depicted as they mirror\r\nthemselves in the mind of the German volunteer. The distrust with which\r\nhe, as a foreigner, is received, the want of liberal-mindedness in\r\nthe devotees of liberty, which he observes more especially in their\r\nconduct to his friend, a Polish officer of Jewish descent, gradually\r\ndissipate the illusions which he had cherished of a golden future for\r\nEurope, the final outcome of the Revolution of July. There is a tragic\r\ntone throughout the book. We are shown how fruitless the rebellion of\r\nthe Poles is, how it ends, as it was fated to end, in crushing defeat;\r\nand we are shown how the young Jew, Joel, in spite of his valiant\r\nendeavours on the battlefield to gain for himself those rights which\r\nhis aristocratic countrymen enjoy, can never rise from his position as\r\nthe pariah of Polish society. The woman he loves dares not give him\r\nher hand; a common peasant disdains his sympathy. After the revolt\r\nis suppressed, he puts off his uniform in despair and shoulders the\r\npedlar's wallet. The Christians repudiate him, the Jews he himself long\r\nago alienated by his alliance with the Christians, his humanity gives\r\nhim no rights; there is nothing for it but to forget his learning, his\r\nphilosophy, his scientific and military talent, and to wander from\r\nvillage to village, selling ribbons, as his forefathers did.\r\n\r\nThis character has a special interest for Danes, as it evidently\r\nsuggested to Goldschmidt some of the leading characteristics of the\r\nhero of his novel, _En Jöde_ (\"A Jew\"); he, too, becomes a Polish\r\nofficer during the struggle for liberty, and he too, repulsed\r\neverywhere, in the bitterness of despair ends his career as a\r\nmoney-lender, outside the pale of society.\r\n\r\nThe Third Part of _Das junge Europa_ (\"The Citizens\") is an inferior\r\nproduction. Its chief interest for us lies in what it tells us of\r\ntwo of the most enthusiastic, indomitable heroes of the First Part,\r\nHippolyt and Constantin. Hippolyt is finally driven to despair by the\r\ncivilisation of the modern world, which leaves no room for the great\r\nexception, but requires all to be alike small. The bold Constantin,\r\nwho fought in the streets of Paris in the Days of July, makes his\r\nappearance not very many years later as a Prussian judge, inflexibly,\r\nfanatically severe in his dealings with political revolutionaries.\r\nConstantin enters into long explanations of the influences that have\r\nwrought the change in his convictions (this character was evidently\r\ndrawn from the life); but the author is still so possessed by the\r\nideals of his own youth, that he makes this man commit suicide in\r\ndespair at having been unfaithful to these ideals.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1849 till his death in the Eighties, Laube, as is well\r\nknown, devoted all his powers to the theatre. He speedily became\r\nthe best and most highly esteemed theatrical manager of Germany and\r\nAustria. As such he always retained a preference for the French drama.\r\nWhat he himself wrote for the stage is what will keep his name longest\r\nin remembrance.\r\n\r\nOf the many historical dramas which he produced, the most\r\nimportant--_Monaldeschi_ (1834), _Struensee_ (1844), and _Die\r\nKarlsschüler_ (1847)--are suggestive of the ideals of Young Germany as\r\nthey took shape in Laube's mind. The last-mentioned play became popular\r\nand is still often put on the stage; the others are effective pieces in\r\na style that is now obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe character of Monaldeschi is a vigorous conception. He is the\r\nbold, unscrupulous adventurer, who has no higher aim than to make his\r\nway and to enjoy life to the full, but who understands the meaning\r\nof power, and desires to use his power worthily--the Hippolyt of\r\n_Das junge Europa_ in historic costume. With Queen Christina's more\r\ncomplex feminine character, Laube has not been so successful, though\r\nhis representation of her has elements out of which a good actress\r\ncould make a telling part. But the play as a whole is overweighted by\r\nthe intolerable sentimentality of the love scenes (Monaldeschi has a\r\nromantic attachment to a certain Sylva Brahe), and it suffers as a work\r\nof art from its author's dread of offending a Philistine public's sense\r\nof propriety. The real relations between Christina and Monaldeschi are\r\nsmoothed down into indistinctness. The sharp edges of historic fact\r\nare filed away to make the subject fit into the mould of theatrical\r\nRomanticism.\r\n\r\nIn _Struensee_, the second of Laube's dramas in which the action\r\npasses at a Scandinavian court, still greater liberties have been\r\ntaken with history and historical characters. Laube makes Struensee\r\nthe noble, liberty-loving reformer, whose only fault is an excessive\r\nGerman humanity, which shrinks from shedding blood. Had he only\r\nbeen a trifle less high-minded and scrupulous, he might easily have\r\nremained in power. The weakness that is his ruin is his chivalrous,\r\nplatonic devotion to Caroline Mathilde, who returns the sentiment\r\nin an equally innocent manner. Christian VII. is represented as an\r\nestimable, somewhat taciturn monarch, subject to attacks of melancholy.\r\nStruensee's fall is brought about entirely by Germans, who are\r\npartly envious of him, partly enraged because he will not comply\r\nwith their unreasonable wishes; and the bitter moral of the play is,\r\nthat the worst enemies of a German intellectual hero are his own\r\ncountrymen--Germans have always had to suffer most from Germans, who\r\nshow their want of patriotism even in their relations with foreigners.\r\n\r\nQuite apart from the historic inaccuracy of the character, the\r\nsentimentally erotic Struensee, with \"his enthusiasm for all that\r\nis noble and beautiful,\" is a very impossible parvenu minister of\r\nstate. Laube has tampered with facts to the extent of representing\r\nStruensee's death as the result of a shot fired, by order of Guldberg,\r\nat the moment of his arrest in the castle on the 17th of January\r\n1772. The chief reason, and at the same time excuse, for all this\r\nperversion of facts lay in the necessity for presenting them in such\r\na shape that the censorship might not forbid the play on account of\r\nthe possibility of its giving offence to a friendly power. We get some\r\nidea of how severe this censorship was, when we read that, in spite of\r\nLaube's precautions, the performance of _Struensee_ was for many years\r\nprohibited in Prussia, out of consideration for the feelings of the\r\nDanish royal family.\r\n\r\nIt is, nevertheless, impossible to understand why such a perfectly\r\nharmless and studiously, punctiliously, inoffensive play as _Die\r\nKarlsschüler_ should, immediately after its appearance in 1846, have\r\nbeen prohibited throughout Austria, Prussia, Hanover, Würtemberg,\r\nHesse-Cassel, all the Grand Duchies and several of the Duchies. It is\r\nin reality nothing whatever but a panegyric on the youthful Schiller,\r\nin a representation of the well-known difficulties he got into as a\r\nyoung regimental surgeon in the service of Duke Karl of Würtemberg,\r\nending with his flight from Stuttgart to Mannheim. It forms a\r\nparallel to Gutzkow's Goethe comedy, _Der Königslieutenant_, which it\r\nsurpasses in dramatic vigour. In this case, too, Laube has sacrificed\r\nstrict historic truth. Duke Karl's character is softened and toned\r\ndown exactly as King Frederick William's was in Gutzkow's _Zopf und\r\nSchwert_. This is not only art which is compelled to be cautious, but\r\nart which has come into being under the oppression of a tradition which\r\nhas insinuated itself into the very disposition of the artist. But the\r\ndisposition was a cheerful, buoyant one, and the hand that wrote these\r\nscenes was light and skilful. Something of the lustre that surrounds\r\nits hero's name is shed upon the play. It is probable that as long as\r\nSchiller retains his great popularity in Germany, Germans will enjoy\r\nseeing this transcription of his youthful history--though they know\r\nmany facts concerning that history now that were not known at the\r\ntime _Die Karlsschüler_ was written. Such a play is not calculated to\r\nproduce much effect out of Germany.\r\n\r\nAfter Gutzkow's and Laube's, Mundt's is the name that occurs most\r\nfrequently when mention is made of the leaders of Young Germany. It is\r\nabout the year 1835 that Mundt is most distinctly the mouthpiece of\r\nthe feelings and ideas of that school. In 1835 he published _Charlotte\r\nStieglitz, ein Denkmal_, the only one of his historical delineations\r\nwhich had any real influence on the minds of the youth of the day. This\r\nwork, no doubt chiefly owing to its subject, but also to its pathetic,\r\naffectionately reverent treatment of that subject, took thousands of\r\nhearts by storm. In the same year appeared his _Madonna, Unterhaltungen\r\nmit einer Heiligen_ (\"Converse with a Saint\"), which, more than any\r\nother of his works, gives expression to the sentiments of Young\r\nGermany, and a clue to the character of its author.\r\n\r\nTheodor Mundt, born at Potsdam in 1808, was a man capable of\r\nenthusiastic, yet clear-sighted devotion to causes and to persons. He\r\nhad Wienbarg's enthusiastic temperament (though not his bravery), with\r\na much more highly gifted, many-sided mind. And yet there was no edge\r\nor pungency in his wit, no grace in his whimsicality, no method in his\r\nworks, no conciseness in his style. His book on Charlotte Stieglitz\r\nis the only one of his works that has survived him, and it has done\r\nso thanks to its subject. He could be caustic and biting and unjust,\r\nas weak natures are apt to be, but even his most caustic tirades\r\nare not the expression of any warlike inclination; they are only\r\npenned in self-defence and self-assertion, are called forth by some\r\nmisunderstanding on the part of an opponent, and are no more dangerous\r\nthan the thrusts of an angry wether.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to the modern reader that a work like Mundt's\r\n_Madonna_ can ever have been considered a dangerous book. To understand\r\nhow this could be, we must keep in mind that those in power at the\r\ntime of its publication stood in terror of shadows. It is, however, a\r\nbook which must not be overlooked by any one who is making a study of\r\nthe period, for there is something typical in its expression of the\r\nthoughts and enthusiasms of the youth of the day.\r\n\r\nIn its very formlessness, _Madonna_ is characteristic of Mundt, and\r\nof those whose literary taste was identical with his. It contains\r\nprose lyric effusions, descriptions of travel, personal confessions,\r\nworld-revolutionising theories of the rehabilitation of the flesh by\r\nmeans of a hitherto unknown mystic creed--all this grouped round a\r\ncentral female figure and interwoven with her story.\r\n\r\nThe book opens with a \"post-horn symphony,\" well written in the old\r\nRomantic style, but not Romantic in tendency. It is a glorification\r\nof \"movement,\" the shibboleth which Mundt invented and fell in love\r\nwith. Movement is to him what progress and the struggle for freedom\r\nwere to others--the watchword of the new era. He talks of the party\r\nof movement; the new literature is to him the literature of movement\r\n(_Bewegungslitteratur_); in a postscript to _Madonna_ he calls that\r\nbook _ein Bewegungsbuch_. We perceive that the expression is perfectly\r\nneutral and innocent.\r\n\r\nThe only readable part of _Madonna_ nowadays is the heroine's\r\nnarrative of her life experiences. The author meets her in a little\r\nBohemian village; when he first sees her, walking in a Roman Catholic\r\nprocession, he is tremendously impressed by her extraordinary beauty.\r\nLater in the same day he accidently makes his way into her father's\r\ncottage, wins the narrow-minded, bigoted old man's heart (in a very\r\nimprobable manner) by the unction with which he tells him the story of\r\nCasanova, who had at one time lived in that neighbourhood in the castle\r\nof Dux, receives an invitation to supper, and spends part of the night\r\nin a sentimental conversation with the daughter, whom he discovers to\r\nbe a woman deserving, in his estimation, the name of saint--a secular\r\nor worldly saint (_eine Weltheilige_)--and who, in that capacity,\r\nembraces and kisses him, weeping hot tears. He is obliged to leave the\r\nneighbourhood next morning, but soon afterwards receives from her an\r\nimmoderately lengthy letter--_Die Bekenntnisse einer weltlichen Seele_\r\n(\"The Confessions of a Worldly Soul\")--in which she makes a frank\r\nrevelation of herself and all her experiences.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful girl is an unfortunate victim. She has been enticed by\r\na relative, a depraved woman, to leave Teplitz, her native town, where\r\nshe lived in poverty with her parents, and come to Dresden. There,\r\nunder the pretext of providing for her future, this woman educated her\r\nfor a rich debauchee, a man of high position, whose prey she was to\r\nbecome as soon as she was grown up. The time comes; all preparations\r\nare made; at night she is locked into a room with her benefactor and\r\npursuer, whom she loathes. She forcibly breaks away from him, manages\r\nto get out, and, in her despair, seeing a light in the room of a young\r\ntheological student who lives in the same house, takes refuge with him.\r\nShe has long loved this young man and he her. Now with chaste passion\r\nshe gives herself to him, and he cannot find it in his heart to repulse\r\nher. But on the following day, repenting as a Christian of his sin,\r\nhe commits suicide. The young girl has to make her way on foot from\r\nDresden to her native village in Bohemia, where, after her experience\r\nof the life and variety of a great town, she pines in sadness and\r\nloneliness. Her old father, with whom she lives, is a cripple and a\r\nfanatically bigoted Roman Catholic.\r\n\r\nThe point in this story evidently lies in the innocence of the young\r\ngirl's self-abandonment, innocence which the world calls guilt. To\r\nthe author his heroine is a saint, a Madonna, the type of lovable\r\nwomanliness. She is a carnal saint, undoubtedly; but it is his creed\r\nthat we can conceive of nothing more holy, that there exists nothing\r\nmore spiritual, than the carnal. And he propounds a neither new nor\r\nremarkable, but somewhat peculiarly formulated theory of the necessity\r\nfor a fusion of flesh and spirit, for the abolition of the distinction\r\nbetween spiritual and carnal. \"The world and the flesh must be\r\nreinstated in their rights, in order that the spirit may no longer have\r\nto live in the sixth storey, as it does in Germany.\" And he brings the\r\nnarration of a very lengthy Bohemian legend of Libussa to a close with\r\nthe jubilant cry: \"The free woman is sovereign; let her decide, let her\r\nspeak, for she has the right to speak! And sweet is the happiness of\r\nfree love!\"\r\n\r\nMundt began as a Hegelian, but his Hegelianism has, as we see, turned\r\ninto a sort of fantastic mysticism. Christ declared that his kingdom is\r\nnot of this world, and yet he came to us and himself became world. God,\r\nout of love, entered into the flesh, and the world's flesh has become\r\nholy since it became God. Hence the kingdom of God flourishes over\r\nthe wide earth, and yet it is, as Christ declared, not of this world,\r\nthat is, not of the world which is flesh only, and which sets its face\r\nagainst the free \"movement\" of thought. Like an insufficiently trained\r\npedant, Mundt involves himself in lengthy and confused polemics against\r\n\"the beyond\" which is without \"the here,\" and against \"the here\" which\r\nrefuses to know anything of \"the beyond.\" He ends by enthusiastically\r\nproclaiming the praises of what he calls \"the image\" (as distinct from\r\nboth spiritless matter and immaterial spirit): \"O ye philosophers! what\r\nyou want is the image.... I contend for the rehabilitation of the\r\nimage.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIf there ever was a man unsuited to be a leader and teacher of\r\nother men, it was this unctuous proclaimer of self-evident truths.\r\n_Madonna_ was followed by a long series of historical novels (a still\r\nlonger series came from the pen of Mundt's wife, who wrote under the\r\npseudonym of Louise Mühlbach), and a considerable number of critical\r\nand historical writings. Amongst these latter one of the best is his\r\n_Geschichte der Litteratur der Gegenwart_ (\"History of Present Day\r\nLiterature\"), 1842, because in it he treats a subject with which he\r\nhas a thorough acquaintance; but it, too, like all his other works,\r\nis formless, full of undigested material, and spoiled by would-be\r\nprofundity. He reads, for instance, a special meaning into the fact\r\nthat Hegel died of cholera. Hegel's system, he writes, was, like\r\nCasimir Périer's, a universally levelling _juste-milieu_ system:\r\nhence he, like Casimir Périer, was fated to die of this universally\r\nlevelling malady. It was a malady which must be regarded as the\r\nphysical expression of the general anguish of the times. Troubled\r\nand restless, the body had attacked its own intestines, and was at\r\nlast obliged to pay the penalty of its craving to know and understand\r\nitself, by performing the last possible process of self-examination,\r\nthat of vomiting itself up.[5]\r\n\r\nIn a work entitled _Das junge Deutschland_, consisting for the\r\nmost part of letters to the publisher, Feodor Wehl, the well-known\r\ntheatrical manager, has endeavoured to give the reading world a\r\nmore favourable idea of Mundt than that prevalent in our days; and\r\nhe has succeeded in producing the impression that Mundt was a man\r\nwith excellent intentions, many acquirements, and no small degree of\r\nenthusiasm in the causes that were sympathetic to him. He is not, and\r\nnever will be considered, a great writer.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the second rank, the rearguard of Young Germany, men\r\nlike Gustav Kühne, Hermann Marggraff, and Alexander Jung, are in\r\nreality his equals. Their gifts lie, like his, partly in the direction\r\nof journalism, partly in that of creative authorship. They are men of\r\ncharacter, cultivation, and distinct literary ability, animated by the\r\nsame fundamental ideas as the men in the front ranks.\r\n\r\nThe reader who takes up Kühne's _Weibliche und männliche Charaktere_\r\n(1838) will be agreeably surprised by the vigour and brilliancy of his\r\ndelineations, and by his accurate appreciations of public personages.\r\nHis heroines are those of his school--Rahel, Bettina, Charlotte\r\nStieglitz; but he sees them with his own eyes and describes them with\r\nunpretentious enthusiasm. Among the poets, who are the subjects of\r\nhis laudatory criticism, are not only the great Radicals of a former\r\ngeneration like Shelley, not only all the singers of freedom of his\r\nown day, from Anastasius Grün to Karl Beck, but tranquil spirits\r\nlike Rückert and Chamisso. He is not remarkably original, but he is\r\nimpartial and unprejudiced.\r\n\r\nThe same can be said of Hermann Marggraff. Though his book\r\n_Deutschlands jüngste Litteratur- und Culturepoche_ (1839), is written\r\nin the spirit of Young Germany, its author always reserves his right to\r\nperfectly independent judgment. He is a thoughtful, earnest critic and\r\na good writer, always natural, at times brilliant. His errors are much\r\nmore due to Conservative tendencies than to excessive modernity.\r\n\r\nUnless we single out the _enfants perdus_ of this new school--and there\r\nare such in every school--it cannot be said that its members gave any\r\nreal occasion for the violent attacks made upon it. It is not Young\r\nGermany, but its assailants, who uniformly show the worst taste and\r\nexaggerate most grossly.\r\n\r\nSuch an assailant was Tieck, now an elderly man. Several of his tales\r\ncontain thrusts at Young Germany; that in which it is satirised most\r\ndirectly is _Der Wassermensch_; but the caricature is so overdone that\r\nit loses all effect.\r\n\r\nFlorheim, the representative of Young Germany, is half crazy with\r\nenthusiasm for Frenchmen and Jews. He poses as the democrat and\r\nfriend of freedom in a manner which we should consider foolish in an\r\nordinary schoolboy. He maintains that in every concert programme the\r\nMarseillaise ought to have a place, to keep people from forgetting\r\nwhat is the one thing above all others. He would have portraits of the\r\ngreat heroes of liberty, Mirabeau, Washington, Franklin, Kosciuszko,\r\n&c, inserted in every printed book, even in cookery books. In every\r\nalmanac, if he could have his will, July should be printed in red\r\nletters, to keep the glorious Revolution of July in ever fresh\r\nremembrance. And he hopes that all the truly noble will unite in\r\ninsisting that the nouns, prince, lord, king, count, squire, &c, shall\r\nbe written without capital letters, in order to show contempt for their\r\nsignification.\r\n\r\nWhen the Privy Councillor (Geheimrath), the representative of\r\nintelligent Conservatism, asks Florheim how he and his (\"Sie, die Sie\r\nsich das junge Deutschland nennen\"--you who call yourselves Young\r\nGermany) hope to carry out their plans and plots against the existing\r\norder of things, he answers naïvely: \"By perpetual abuse of all that\r\nstands in our way.\" And he goes on to show how it was thus they treated\r\nGoethe in the last years of his age--an assertion which is quite\r\ncontrary to fact--and how, now that they are the \"party of movement\"\r\nand already in possession of the most important newspapers, they are\r\nin a position to form an invisible and yet open league spread over the\r\nwhole of Germany, which shall ruin every author who is not of their\r\nway of thinking, and make the reputation of its own members by means\r\nof unscrupulous mutual laudations.[6]\r\n\r\nThe reality was very different from this. The caricature has the double\r\nfault of not being like and not being amusing. Mundt took an ingenious\r\nrevenge some years later by suggesting the performance of Tieck's\r\nfairy-tale comedies in Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A. Strodtmann: H.

In books,\r\neffect is a first consideration; what is represented in them must\r\nbe to a certain extent exaggerated, thrown into relief, if only for\r\nthe sake of distinctness. To find the clue to the intellectual life\r\n_lived_ at any given period, we must get as close as possible to the\r\nliving, feeling, individual, and we must not neglect to supplement the\r\nimpression received from an observation of the leading men of the time\r\nby a study of its typical women.\r\n\r\nIt is where there is more feeling than action, where, in spite of great\r\noriginality, the formative, the fashioning power is too slight entirely\r\nto separate the production from the personality, that the student comes\r\ninto closest contact with the life-springs of a period. A letter from\r\na highly gifted woman tells us more of the living human being and its\r\nreal emotions than a political speech or a tragedy.\r\n\r\nNot one of the few great women who ruled men's minds during the period\r\nunder consideration produced a work of art; not one of them even\r\nattempted to. They neither wrote novels nor essays. Their literary\r\ninfluence was a directly personal influence, and their power of\r\nstirring men's minds was evidently due to the fact that something of\r\nthe inmost essence of the period was expressed in their personalities.\r\nTheir natures are unplastic, evasive; the contours of their spiritual\r\nlives are blurred and indistinct; this makes it difficult to delineate\r\ntheir characters, but makes it all the easier to feel the pulse of the\r\ntime in their utterances.\r\n\r\nThey help us to arrive at the result that the idea which shapes the\r\nlives of the most noble characters of this period, and which makes\r\nitself felt in the resistance they offered to the worship of rule and\r\nthe tyranny of custom, is the idea that the one course worthy of a\r\nthinking, feeling, human being is independently and unconventionally\r\nto interpret human life, human relations, for himself, and to base\r\nhis conduct on his own interpretation. This is not a new idea; it\r\noriginated in Germany with Herder, descended from him to all the\r\npreachers of the gospel of Nature, including that Heinse who had such\r\na strong influence upon some of the leaders of Young Germany, but was\r\nmore especially developed and applied in all the relations of life\r\nby Goethe. A careful study of the characters of the most remarkable\r\nwomen of the time shows that the subterranean, hidden secret of the\r\nperiod between 1810 and 1838, what had happened deepest down, was that\r\nGoethe's theory of life had, point by point, displaced the Church\r\ntheory and taken possession of all the men of great instincts, of all\r\nthe really gifted minds of the day.\r\n\r\nRahel Varnhagen von Ense is, beyond all comparison, the greatest of\r\nthe women who occupied the attention of intellectual Germany in the\r\nThirties and Forties. She died in March 1833, and in 1835 her husband\r\npublished the three volumes of selections from her letters and journals\r\nwhich revealed to the great reading public what manner of woman she had\r\nbeen. This publication was followed by many others, of which she was\r\nthe main theme.\r\n\r\nA less innately great, but much more talented woman than Rahel was\r\nBettina von Arnim, who, in 1835, published _Goethe's Briefwechsel mit\r\neinem Kinde_ (Goethe's Correspondence with a Child), a work which\r\ncreated a great sensation and was most favourably received.\r\n\r\nRahel's name is remembered by the quiet, powerful influence she\r\nsteadily exercised for so many years; Bettina's shines with the lustre\r\nof her brilliant talent and sparkling wit; the third woman who made\r\na deep impression on the men and women of that day is remembered by\r\none action, her suicide. This was Charlotte Stieglitz, who committed\r\nsuicide in December 1834, and whose biography, diaries, and letters\r\nwere published by Theodor Mundt in 1835. She was at once made the\r\nsubject of studies and panegyrics by the new school. Gustav Kühne, in\r\nparticular, wrote an admirable notice of her. It was her death which,\r\nas has been already mentioned, suggested Gutzkows _Wally_.\r\n\r\nRahel Antonie Friederike Varnhagen (family name originally Levin,\r\nafterwards Robert) was born in Berlin in 1771. She would thus seem to\r\nbelong to quite another epoch than that of the Revolution of July; but\r\nit was not until after her death that she became a public personage,\r\nand entered, by means of her written words, into relations with the\r\nliterary public. She was one of those rare beings whose inexhaustible\r\nvigour and freshness of mind enable them to understand everything and\r\nevery one, to sympathise with the most dissimilar individuals and\r\ntendencies, to penetrate to the core of things; and whose wide and\r\nuntiring sympathy wins for them all their life long the affection and\r\nadmiration of the élite of their time, young and old. Rahel received\r\nthe same homage from Karl Gutzkow that she had received from Schelling\r\nand Friedrich Schlegel, from Schleiermacher and Wilhelm von Humboldt.\r\nShe had shown herself a fervid patriot during the war of liberation,\r\nsuperintending hospitals in Berlin and Prague; and she was admired\r\nby Heinrich Heine, who dedicated the Lyric Intermezzo in the _Buch\r\nder Lieder_ to her when she was fifty. She, who had been the intimate\r\nof the famous men of the beginning of the century, the Prince de\r\nLigne, Fichte, Prince Louis Ferdinand, Fouqué, and many others,\r\nsurprised every one by her enthusiastic appreciation of Victor Hugo's\r\n_Les Orientales_, and the writings of the Saint-Simonists. There is\r\nsomething great about such a life, undramatic though it be.\r\n\r\nIt gives us a feeling of the many-sidedness of her character to\r\nremember the long list of persons, differing from each other in\r\nevery possible way, with whom she was on intimate terms. There are\r\ndepths in her nature which still surprise us, and vaguenesses quite\r\nincomprehensible to the modern mind. The magic of her nature lay in\r\nthe spoken word, the momentary impression, the opportune utterance: so\r\nit is not easy to reconstruct. A strong influence emanated from her,\r\nyet her real life was introspective; she was a woman of distinctly\r\naristocratic instincts and sentiments, and yet so tender hearted that\r\nher sympathies extended far and wide.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of a rich Jewish merchant, as a girl plain-looking and\r\nwithout talent of any description, she grows up in her father's house\r\nin Berlin at a time when as yet the Jews had none of the rights\r\nof citizens. At the age of twenty-five she has already become an\r\ninfluential member of the best society of the capital, and from the\r\nage of thirty till her death her house is the intellectual centre of\r\nBerlin, and one of the intellectual centres of Germany. Her great\r\nattraction was her perfect originality and unconventionality. All\r\nhuman beings desire and love to see themselves mirrored in the mind\r\nof a greater human being, all crave for sympathy, all would fain\r\nbe understood. And those who approached Rahel--princes and nobles,\r\ndiplomats and philosophers, poets and scientists--felt instinctively\r\nthat this young girl with the slight, graceful figure, the beautifully\r\nformed limbs, the thick, waving hair surrounding a face with an\r\nexpression of suffering, but with a deep, steadfast look in its\r\ndark eyes, was worthy of their confidence, and this for the one and\r\nsufficient reason, that she was innocent of all prejudices.\r\n\r\nShe gladly associates with a charming hetæra like Pauline Wiese,\r\nPrince Louis Fredinand's friend; is her and her cynical husband's\r\nand her princely lover's confidante. She has a sincere regard for a\r\nreactionary sensualist like Friedrich Gentz, warmly congratulates him\r\nwhen he, at the age of sixty, wins the affections of Fanny Elsler, sees\r\nin him the distinguished prose writer and the politician who had been\r\nof national importance at a critical moment. Human beings are to her,\r\nin Goethe's sense, natural products.\r\n\r\nThat she, with her strict personal morality and Liberal tendencies,\r\nshould have been able to rise to such a height of freedom from\r\nprejudice and gain such a wide horizon, was primarily due to her having\r\nbeen born in a sort of sanctuary outside the pale of society, that is\r\nto say in the house of a wealthy Berlin Jew.\r\n\r\nIn intolerant, stiff old Prussia, the alien, despised, hooknosed\r\nmoney-lenders had sat behind their counters for some centuries, with\r\nno thought for anything but money--piling thaler upon thaler, buying\r\nbills, and lending money even to princes. With all their wealth they\r\nwere ignorant, orthodox, superstitious. But during the period of\r\nenlightenment the influence of Moses Mendelssohn thoroughly aroused\r\nthem. Their piety became a noble rationalism, and they comprehended\r\nthe meaning of knowledge and culture. By the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury they were giving their sons a perfectly new training, and\r\nsociety was also beginning to look upon these sons as men to whom\r\nreparation for a wrong was due.\r\n\r\nIt was in the generation of these sons that the Jewish houses all at\r\nonce opened their long closed doors, revealing interiors which in no\r\nway resembled the cramped middle-class German houses--spacious rooms\r\nwith rich Oriental carpets and hangings; here and there a valuable\r\npainting, made over to father or grandfather by some prince in\r\npecuniary difficulties; on the dinner tables gold and silver plate, the\r\nfinest crystal sparkling upon lace-edged linen, choice viands, and the\r\nrarest wines. The mistress of the house and her daughters had received\r\na higher and more refined education than others in their rank of life;\r\nthey were deeply interested in theology, philosophy, and music; they\r\nhad developed quickly under the influence of the mixed society which\r\nnow frequented their house.[1]\r\n\r\nFor here, as upon neutral ground, met all those whom society usually\r\nseparated, members of all its different ranks and castes, and many whom\r\nit altogether excluded; German and foreign actresses had the entrance\r\nof no other middle-class houses in Berlin; here they were received on\r\nthe same footing as the other guests. The princes frequented no other\r\nmiddle-class houses, if it were for no other reason than that the\r\ncompany they met there bored them. To these houses they came, attracted\r\nby the easy tone and by the wit of the women. It was a refined Bohemia.\r\nIt was the first development of the cosmopolitan spirit in the Berlin\r\nof old Prussia.\r\n\r\nIt is in these circles that Rahel grows up, early distinguished by\r\nher friendship with Prince Louis Ferdinand, the hero of the young\r\ngeneration of that day, son of Frederick the Great's youngest brother.\r\nHe was about Rahel's own age, chivalrous, artistic, loose in his\r\nmorals, brave to foolhardiness, a first-rate musician, and a first-rate\r\ncavalry general. Goethe describes him in his book on the campaign of\r\n1793. Like all the princes of that day, he had been educated like\r\na Frenchman, to the extent (as we know from some of his published\r\nletters) of not being able to spell German correctly; nevertheless\r\nhe was an ardent enemy of Napoleon, and burned to match his troops\r\nagainst the great Emperor's. Like the Prince of Homburg in his day,\r\nhe disobeyed an order to retreat, and, infuriated by the defeat at\r\nSaalfeld, refusing to flee, refusing to yield, was cut down by the\r\nFrench hussars. He confided his wild love adventures to Rahel, and\r\nfound comfort, when suffering from the treachery of a faithless lady\r\nlove, in tranquil, serious conversation with his sisterly friend.\r\n\r\nBut Rahel was not always in a position to comfort others. In her young\r\ndays she stood sorely in need of comfort herself. By nature she was\r\nof such an irritably nervous temperament that as a child she was with\r\ndifficulty kept in life: \"Let the air be too dense or too rare, too\r\nwarm or too cold, and I am ill at once. And the slightest excitement\r\nhas a still worse effect. I cannot imagine any one more sensitive.\" In\r\nnearly all her letters, immediately after the date, we find a detailed\r\ndescription of the weather and temperature: \"Friday, 14th March,\r\n1828.--A grey day, with south-west wind, damp and yet spring-like,\r\nthough not inviting for a walk. Pigeons are flying. Every now and\r\nthen a blue window appears in the sky; at this moment sunlight is\r\ncoming through one of them.\" \"23rd March, 1829.--The sun has broken\r\nthrough the clouds and is shining brightly; a cold, sharp, unmistakable\r\nnorth-east wind; impossible to go to the Thiergarten, where there is\r\nstill ice and it is as cold as in a cellar.\" \"17th April,--Noon; spring\r\nweather after rain; the trees turning green. To me the best time of the\r\nwhole year--no flies or mosquitoes, no heat. Spring is approaching,\r\nwafting to us a thousand memories, and a thousand hopes which can never\r\nbe fulfilled, but which are a necessity to us.\"\r\n\r\nSuch natures deserve and arouse as much compassion as admiration.\r\nHer friend, W. von Burgsdorf, writes to her: \"When I saw you for the\r\nfirst time, it struck me at once that you must have been educated by\r\nlong suffering.\" It was true; she had had an infirm body, a melancholy\r\nyouth, a severe father, and had early suffered humiliation. Her Jewish\r\nbirth was the cause of great unhappiness to her--an unhappiness almost\r\nunworthy of her; she calls it a sword thrust into her heart by a\r\nsupernatural being at the moment of her birth. Not one fibre in her\r\nnature attached her to the religious community to which by birth she\r\nbelonged. The memory of its fanaticism and of the fanatical enmity\r\ndisplayed towards it was still fresh. As lately as 1756 the Jewish\r\ncommunity in Berlin had expelled a child from the town for having\r\ncarried a book for a Christian. And on the other side, even Moses\r\nMendelssohn could not go out with his children without having stones\r\nthrown at them.\r\n\r\nWith all the power of his intellect and will, Rahel's father had\r\nstriven to overcome the sickly child's independence of character,\r\nand only her unusual elasticity and strength of mind enabled her to\r\npreserve her originality. When young she felt as if she had suffered\r\nso much there could not possibly be anything left in her to be bent or\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that a woman with this passionate nature should love\r\npassionately and should suffer agony through her love. And she did not\r\nescape her fate. Twice, when she loved most ardently, she experienced\r\nas it were the feeling of being struck down with an assassin's knife\r\nand of living for years with the knife in the wound.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty-four she formed a very strong attachment to Count\r\nKarl von Finckenstein, the son of a Prussian minister, a man a year\r\nyounger than herself. They became engaged, and Rahel lived for some\r\nyears solely for this love. Finckenstein was good-hearted, very much\r\nin love, and sincerely devoted to her, but his character was weak. He\r\ntold her what he had to bear from his family, whose pride revolted\r\nagainst an alliance with a person of inferior position, and who\r\nwere endeavouring to make him give her up. Rahel's pride was deeply\r\nwounded, and she gave him back his word. In character and intellect his\r\nsuperior, she could easily have vanquished his scruples if she had made\r\nup her mind to do so, but instead of this she set him free at once, and\r\nhe was weak enough, attached though he was to her, to take the liberty\r\nshe offered. She never overcame this first great humiliation.\r\n\r\nThree years passed, and she fell in love again, this time passionately,\r\nsoul and senses, and the feeling was returned. Her second engagement\r\nwas to Don Raphael Urquijo, a particularly attractive young attaché\r\nof the Spanish embassy in Berlin. The engagement lasted for a year.\r\nThey were passionately attached to each other, but their characters\r\nwere too unlike, he was too decidedly her inferior. He tormented and\r\ninsulted her with his jealousy to such an extent that to preserve\r\nher self-respect she parted from him; but she did it with a feeling\r\nof crushing, maddening grief, a feeling of loneliness, of being left\r\nexposed to all the coldness of life without that shelter from it which\r\nshe, with her woman's heart, could so ill dispense with.\r\n\r\nAfter Finckenstein's desertion, it had been proposed that she should\r\nmake a _mariage de convenance_. Her answer was: \"I cannot marry, for I\r\ncannot lie. Do not imagine that I am proud of myself for this; I cannot\r\ndo it, just as I cannot play the flute.... He must have no prejudices,\r\notherwise I could not stand it.... And he must not be stupid and\r\ncompel me to lie and pretend that I admire him. I must be able to say\r\nexactly what I choose.\"\r\n\r\nFor long the needs of her heart were only incompletely satisfied, and\r\nshe applied herself all the more ardently to intellectual pursuits. It\r\nwas a great hindrance to her that she had acquired so little knowledge.\r\nShe herself talked about her dense ignorance. She was, of course,\r\nvery far from being ignorant, but so much is certain, that she never\r\nacquired any real insight into what science is, and never thought a\r\nscientific thought.\r\n\r\nShe had been taught as little Jewish dogma as history and geography.\r\nShe says that she grew up like a tree in the forest, and that it was as\r\nimpossible for her to learn religion as anything else. So she evolved\r\na religion of her own, which, as Karl Hillebrand correctly observes,\r\nhas something akin with Schopenhauer's doctrine; her ideas of a will in\r\nnature, of the misery of the world, of compassion as the only source of\r\nmorality, are akin to his. She was a great admirer of Angelus Silesius\r\nand Saint-Martin; like Goethe she was an ardent Pantheist, She copies\r\nthe German mystic's lines:\r\n\r\n   \"Alle Tugenden sind eine Tugend.\r\n    Schau, alle Tugenden sind ein ohn' Unterschied.\r\n    Willst du den Namen hör'n? Sie heisst Gerechtigkeit,\"[2]\r\n\r\nand writes beneath them:\r\n\r\n\"Weil sie Wahrheit ist Einfachheit, Unparteilichkeit, Selbstlosigkeit,\r\nAustheilung für Alle.\"[3]\r\n\r\nShe saw everything in its unity, its entirety. There was something\r\nof the Delphic priestess in her nature. It is a pity that her words,\r\ndisconnected from her personality as we have them, are so often dark\r\noracular sayings.\r\n\r\nShe was, says Karl Hillebrand, full of leniency towards the culpable,\r\nof sympathy with the slighted and humble, of compassion for the poor;\r\nthe one thing she despised was correct mediocrity, and her contempt for\r\nthis she displayed openly, even when by so doing she made enemies.\r\n\r\nTime passed, and she grew into the old maid; but years made no change\r\nin her appearance and did not diminish her wonderful power. For ten\r\nyears she carried on a tender correspondence with her future husband,\r\nVarnhagen von Ense. He was fourteen years younger than herself, was\r\nfirst a brave officer, then a clever diplomatist, and finally an\r\nexcellent, very aggressive writer; he had to distinguish himself in\r\nboth war and peace before he could appear in the character of her\r\nfiancé without being entirely overlooked. She married him when she was\r\nforty-two, and had a perfectly happy married life for nineteen years.\r\n\r\nRahel owes her literary distinction to the fact that she was the\r\nfirst in the literary circles of Berlin to comprehend and to proclaim\r\nGoethe's real greatness. Long before any decisive opinion on this vital\r\nquestion in German culture had been arrived at, Rahel, fully persuaded\r\nof Goethe's genius, completely under the spell of its power, proclaimed\r\nto all with whom she came into contact that this man was not to be\r\ncompared with other men; that he stood alone--the loftiest intellect,\r\nthe wisest counsellor and judge in all the affairs of life. This was\r\nat a time when Goethe as an author was only one among the crowd, and\r\nwhen others were ranked high above him. Long before the criticism of\r\nthe brothers Schlegel established his position beyond dispute, Rahel\r\nhad introduced the cult of the great, uncomprehended, misjudged genius\r\nin her circle in Berlin, had everywhere proclaimed the praises of his\r\nilluminating word, and declared his name to be a holy, a consecrated\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIn 1795, when she is only twenty-four, she is so fortunate as to meet\r\nhim at Teplitz. We learn from a letter from David Veit to Rahel,\r\nwhat Goethe said about her: \"Yes, that now is a girl of remarkable\r\nintellect, a girl who is always thinking--and as to feeling--where is\r\nthe like of her to be found? We were constantly together, and were on\r\nthe most friendly, intimate terms.\" To Franz Horn, Goethe said: \"She\r\nis a girl with a loving heart; she feels everything very strongly, and\r\nyet expresses herself very gently--we admire the originality and are\r\ncharmed by the amiability.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Rahel is told this, she writes: \"How can he know that I have\r\nfeeling? Never in my life was it so difficult for me to show myself as\r\nI am. But why write thus? He is Goethe. And what he feels and says is\r\ntrue. I believe what he says of me.... When you see him, Horn, greet\r\nhim from one who has always worshipped him, idolised him, even when no\r\none else praised, understood, admired him. And if he wonders at a staid\r\nyoung woman sending him such a greeting, make him understand that her\r\nexcessive reverence for him prevented her telling him how she reveres\r\nhim. Tell him that this is not affectation, but true, tender feeling\r\n(_Pflaumenweichheit_). It is not my fault that others affect what in my\r\ncase is serious earnest. Am I not right? Yes, yes! I worship him.\"\r\n\r\nNothing further happens; there is not the slightest attempt on Rahel's\r\npart to keep up the acquaintance with Goethe, by correspondence, or any\r\nother means. She never mentions his person, only his genius. Twenty\r\nyears pass, during which she sees nothing of him. Once, in 1811,\r\nVarnhagen sends Goethe some appreciations of his poetry written by\r\nRahel. Goethe is much struck by them, pronounces the author to have a\r\nremarkable gift of instantaneously grasping, comprehending, connecting,\r\nhelping, completing; but he never learns--Rahel having forbidden\r\nVarnhagen to tell--who the author of the manuscript is. In 1815, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Frankfort, Rahel sees Goethe again. There is something\r\ntouching about this meeting. Goethe is now sixty-six. He is visiting\r\nhis friend, Marianne von Willemer (the Suleika of the _Diwan_) at\r\nWillemer's country house \"die Gerbermühle.\" Rahel, who is in Frankfort,\r\naccidentally sees him driving with his hosts, and in her sudden joyful\r\nsurprise calls loudly: \"There is Goethe.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty years, as already mentioned, have passed. It is a quarter past\r\nnine on the morning of the 8th of September. Rahel, who had been\r\nsuffering from an affection of the eyes, has got up later than usual,\r\nand is standing half-dressed, brushing her teeth, when the landlord\r\ncomes to say that a gentleman wishes to see her. Her maid hands her\r\nhis card. It is Goethe. And out of pure respect, that he may not have\r\nto wait, she does not take time to dress herself properly, to make\r\nherself look presentable: \"I told them to ask him to walk into the\r\nsitting-room, and only kept him waiting the time that it took me to put\r\non a dressing-gown (_Unterrock_). It was a black quilted dressing-gown.\r\nI sacrificed myself so as not to keep him waiting one minute. It was\r\nmy one thought. I did not even excuse my dress; I did nothing but\r\nthank him. I did not excuse myself, for it seemed to me that he must\r\nknow that _I_ obliterated myself, that _he_ was my one consideration.\r\nSuch was--alas!--the first impulse of my heart. Now, with the most\r\npassionate, most comical, most torturing remorse, I think otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling of being unsuitably, unbecomingly dressed, depressed her;\r\nshe said nothing that was worthy of her. After all these years of\r\nlove for him, of living in him, and longing for him, she saw him once\r\nand once only in private for a few minutes, and this was the turn\r\nthings took. \"But you must hear to the end how ridiculous I was,\" she\r\nwrites to Varnhagen. \"When he had gone I dressed most carefully and\r\nbeautifully. I wanted to make up for everything. I put on a lovely\r\nwhite dress with a high collar, a lace veil, my Moscow shawl.... Now I\r\ncan say as Prince Louis wrote: 'My market value has risen ten thousand\r\nthalers. Goethe has visited me.'\"\r\n\r\nRahel, after twenty years of waiting, after the worship of a lifetime,\r\nreceiving Goethe in a quilted dressing-gown rather than keep him\r\nwaiting ten minutes--this every one will confess to be a supreme\r\nexpression of feminine heroism. After the perusal of many volumes\r\nof Rahel literature, this scene is what remains in one's mind as\r\ndefinitely characterising her. It gives the measure of her reverence,\r\nher understanding, and her capability of overcoming even the most\r\njustifiable vanity of her sex.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that a being with such rare attributes should\r\nhave been entirely destitute of talent, of all creative, plastic\r\npower. Her ingenious and profound thoughts are scattered, as mere\r\nobservations, throughout private letters and records which otherwise\r\nare of little interest to us nowadays. Probably none but enthusiastic\r\ndevotees of the women's rights theories are capable of reading much of\r\nher at a time.\r\n\r\nHer nature was not the artistic nature. Its essence was truthfulness.\r\nShe herself says: \"In the great universal misery of this world, I\r\nhave consecrated myself to one God, truth; and every time I have been\r\nsaved, it has been by him.\" She was a staunch, reliable friend, yet,\r\neven at the risk of sinking in the estimation of others, she frankly\r\nand without shame confessed when the feeling of friendship had ceased\r\nto exist. Closely connected with her truthfulness was her simplicity;\r\nshe made no pretence of being above common weaknesses, no secret of\r\nher love of sweets and her keen interest in the latest Paris fashions.\r\nAnd she was fortunate enough to feel what she deserved to feel, an\r\nundisturbed inward harmony, partly innate, partly acquired, a perfect\r\nconsistency of her spiritual life with her convictions. This was what\r\ngave her her great and justifiable self-confidence. \"Pedantry cannot\r\nexist within thirty miles of where I am,\" she used to say.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how great her moral tolerance was; in intellectual\r\nmatters she was equally forbearing. She neither demanded moral purity\r\nnor marked ability in those she esteemed; what she did demand was\r\nunaffectedness. She was unique in her keen recognition and appreciation\r\nof whatever was natural and original, however unassuming; and she\r\nherself, in spite of her searching intellect, was as naïve and fresh in\r\nperception and expression as a gifted child.\r\n\r\nWhen she was at the zenith of her reputation she was obliged to make\r\nherself unapproachable, to surround herself with all sorts of social\r\nbarricades, that she might be free to choose her associates. She\r\ninvariably chose individuals of markedly original character.\r\n\r\nOne of her intimates, Count Tilly, writes to her: \"I have a thousand\r\npolite messages to give you before I close. One person admires you;\r\na second is devoted to you; a third is astonished by your words of\r\nwisdom; a fourth is grieved to say farewell to you, even when it is\r\nonly a letter that must be brought to a close. It is I, myself, who am\r\nall these different persons.\" This little pleasantry serves to give us\r\nan idea of the varied impressions she produced.\r\n\r\nRahel often reflected on the subject of originality. She writes: \"If\r\na person were to say, 'You imagine it is easy to be original--on the\r\ncontrary, it costs no end of trouble and exertion,' he would be thought\r\ncrazy. And yet the assertion would be a true one. Every one could be\r\noriginal, if only people did not carelessly cram their heads with\r\nhalf-digested maxims, which they pour forth again as carelessly.\"\r\n\r\nThere had been eminent and interesting women in German intellectual\r\nsociety before Rahel. The latest were Caroline, Dorothea, and those\r\nothers known to fame through the Romanticists. Rahel is the first\r\ngreat modern German woman, and the first to be completely conscious\r\nof her originality.[4]\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of originality in her day was not without its accompanying\r\ndanger. It is not the danger of affectation that I allude to. In all\r\ndays and times there have been affected creatures who imagine that\r\nthey are original when they help themselves to soup with their shoes.\r\nBut the perpetual self-inspection and self-examination prevalent in\r\nRahel's day produced a dangerous tendency to impute singularity to very\r\nordinary feelings and impressions, a liability to become unaffectedly\r\nunnatural, like the beautiful Henriette Herz and many of her friends,\r\nwhose outpourings have a haunting flavour of lamp-oil and ink. The\r\nfire-writing of originality is something very different.\r\n\r\nThis is to be found in Bettina's _Goethe's Correspondence with a\r\nChild_. Bettina's letters are written in the fiery characters, the\r\n\"singing flames\" of passion.\r\n\r\nBettina von Arnim, a sister of Clemens Brentano, wife of Achim von\r\nArnim, by family and marriage connected with the Romanticists,\r\nnevertheless belongs as an authoress to the Young German school.\r\nRahel admired and worshipped Goethe timidly, with a beating heart, a\r\nquiet, dignified seriousness. Bettina's admiration showed itself in an\r\ninsinuating, half-sensuous, half-intellectual devotion, a determined\r\nbur-like adhesiveness, and flights of the wildest enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, when she, as a native of the same town, made Goethe's\r\nacquaintance through his mother, she must have been twenty-three,\r\nbut in her ways she was still a child, or rather a being midway\r\nbetween child and woman. She comes to Weimar, provides herself with\r\na superfluous letter of introduction from Wieland, holds out both\r\nher hands to Goethe as soon as she sees him, and forgets herself\r\naltogether. He leads her to the sofa, seats himself beside her, talks\r\nabout the Duchess Amalie's death, asks if she has read about it in the\r\nnewspaper. \"I never read newspapers,\" said I. \"Indeed! I understood\r\nthat you were interested in all that goes on at Weimar.\" \"No, I am only\r\ninterested in you, and I'm far too impatient to be a newspaper reader.\"\r\n\"You are a kind, friendly girl.\" A long pause. She jumps up from the\r\nsofa and throws her arms round his neck.\r\n\r\nThis little anecdote suffices to show the difference between her\r\nposition to Goethe and Rahel's. From her childhood she had been\r\ndistinguished by a youthful daring more often met with in boys than\r\ngirls. At Marburg they still show a tower to the top of which she\r\nclimbed, drawing the ladder up after her, so that she might be alone.\r\nAlong with the agility of a young acrobat, she had something of\r\nMignon's childlike, innocent devotion. She is Mignon in real life, as\r\ncharming as ever, and far less serious.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, when her _Goethe's Briefwechsel mit einem Kinde_ came out,\r\nBettina was fifty. Arnim had died in 1831, Goethe in 1832. She had got\r\nback the letters written by herself to Goethe between 1808 and 1811,\r\nwhen an end was put to their intercourse by an act of discourtesy on\r\nher part towards Frau Goethe, and had taken even greater liberties with\r\nthese letters than Goethe took in _Dichtung und Wahrheit_ with the\r\nexperience of his past life. She expressed in them not only all that\r\nshe had felt, but much that she now thought she ought to have felt;\r\nshe gave to their intercourse a more passionate colouring than really\r\nbelonged to it, and yet in the profoundest sense she was truthful. The\r\nletters were at first accepted as genuine. But strong suspicions were\r\npresently awakened by the fact of Bettina's having published poems,\r\nwhich were undoubtedly addressed to other women, as if they had been\r\nwritten to her; and there came a time when her letters lost all credit\r\nas historic documents, and everything in them was considered to be\r\nfictitious. In 1879, however, Loeper published the genuine letters\r\nwritten by Goethe to Bettina, and it was then seen that in them she\r\nhad made almost no alteration; a few greetings were omitted and _thou_\r\nwas substituted for _you_--nothing more. In only one of the original\r\nletters is she addressed as _thou_, but that letter is the only one\r\nwhich Goethe did not dictate, but wrote with his own hand, so Bettina's\r\nalteration was not altogether unjustifiable. Goethe was in the habit of\r\nenclosing in his letters any poem which he had just written. Bettina\r\nwas conceited enough to imagine that poems addressed to Minna Herzlieb\r\n(even those which played upon the name Herzlieb, and were consequently\r\nincomprehensible to her) and to Marianne von Willemer, were meant for\r\nher. This was an absurd but excusable mistake. It was inexcusable of\r\nher to transpose these poems into prose and incorporate them in her\r\nearlier letters, thereby producing the impression that Goethe had\r\nsimply put her thoughts and feelings into verse.\r\n\r\nWhat she tells us of her intercourse with Goethe's mother, of her\r\neagerness to gather from that mothers lips information about Goethe's\r\nchildhood which might serve as an introduction to _Dichtung und\r\nWahrheit_, and also what she tells about Beethoven and the relation\r\nin which she stood to him, is in all essentials absolutely true.[5]\r\n\r\nNo one with any feeling for poetic enthusiasm who has read Bettina's\r\nbook in his youth will ever forget the first impression produced by her\r\nstyle. There is a vitality about it, an animation, a refined wildness,\r\na rhythmic ring and flow, which astound and fascinate. Turning from\r\nRand's dark hieroglyphs, which suggest a thousand secrets to us, but\r\nwhich we seldom really understand, because the living life which was\r\nthe commentary is no more, it is refreshing to bathe in this clear\r\nspring of naïve and charming devotion. Rahel is more profound and more\r\nrealistic. But talent is such a marvellous thing. The pleasure it gives\r\nis great. We can and must excuse much for its sake.\r\n\r\nIn these letters Bettina is twenty-three to twenty-five years old,\r\nGoethe fifty-eight to sixty. Hence her passion is not the ordinary\r\nhuman passion of a young woman for a young man. She has grown up with\r\nit; it is an inheritance from her mother, Maxe Brentano, who partly\r\nsuggested Werther's Charlotte. She loves Goethe's mother, as a young\r\nwoman always does love the mother of her beloved; she is grateful to\r\nher for having borne him--\"how else should I have known him!\" Her\r\ndevotion to the son finds expression in letters to the mother, till she\r\nmeets him; then she writes to himself.\r\n\r\nAfter that first embrace she looks upon him as her own. She writes to\r\nhis mother: \"It is possible to acquire a kind of possession of a man\r\nwhich no one can dispute. This I have done with Wolfgang. And it is\r\nwhat no one ever did before, in spite of all these love affairs you\r\nhave told me about. Love is the key of the universe; through it the\r\nspirit learns to comprehend and to feel everything. How else could it\r\nlearn!\"\r\n\r\nThese letters have been compared to ships laden with rich cargoes.\r\nGoethe is the guiding star on all their voyages.\r\n\r\nAll her thoughts of him are thoughts of enthusiastic devotion: \"I would\r\nI were sitting at his door like some poor beggar child, so that he\r\nmight come out to give me a piece of bread. He would read in my eyes\r\nwhat I am, would take me into his arms and wrap his cloak round me to\r\nwarm me. I know he would not tell me to go again; I should have my\r\nplace in his house; years would pass, and no one would know where I\r\nwas; years would pass and life would pass; I should see the whole world\r\nmirrored in his face, and more I should not need to learn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Last May, when I saw him for the first time, he picked a young leaf\r\nfrom the vine at his window and held it against my cheek and said:\r\n'Which is softer, the leaf or your cheek?' I was sitting on a stool at\r\nhis feet. How often I have thought of that leaf, and of how he stroked\r\nmy forehead and my face with it, and played with my hair, and said: 'I\r\nam a simple-minded man; it is easy to deceive me; there would be no\r\nglory in doing it.' There was nothing brilliant in these words, but\r\nI have lived that scene over again a thousand times in my thoughts;\r\nI shall drink it in all my life, as the eye drinks light--it was not\r\nintellectual converse, no! but to me it surpasses all the wisdom of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nThere is poetry in this exaltation and in the way in which she tells\r\nof his constant presence with her, of her longing for him, of her dumb\r\njealousy of the famous women who came, as Madame de Staël did, to make\r\nhis acquaintance; there is poetry in her distress at her inability to\r\nbe of any use to him, and in her vivid appreciation of her own capacity.\r\n\r\n\"I must tell you what I dreamt about you last night. I often have the\r\nsame dream. I am going to dance for you. I have the feeling that my\r\ndance will be a success. A crowd has gathered round me. I look for\r\nyou, and see you sitting alone, straight opposite to me; but you don't\r\nseem to see me. With golden shoes on my feet, my shining silver arms\r\nhanging listlessly by my side, I step forward in front of you, and\r\nwait. You lift your head, your eyes involuntarily rest upon me; with\r\nlight steps I begin to trace magic circles, and you keep your eyes upon\r\nme. You follow me through all my bends and turns; I feel the triumph\r\nof success. All that you dimly feel I show you in my dance; you marvel\r\nat the wisdom it reveals. Presently I fling aside my airy mantle, and\r\nlet you see my wings, and away I fly, up to the heights. It rejoices\r\nme that your eyes follow me, and I float down again and sink into your\r\nopen arms.\"\r\n\r\nThis symbolic description is both graceful and felicitous. In Bettina's\r\nGoethe-worship there is something of the same love of mounting and\r\nclimbing that she displayed in her childhood. She climbed up on to the\r\nshoulder of the great Olympian's statue--a statue she was perpetually\r\nmodelling--drew the ladder up after her, and sat there alone, revelling\r\nin the pleasure of being so near him. But it was not her Goethe-worship\r\nmerely as such which made Bettina an ideal character, a Valkyrie, in\r\nthe eyes of Young Germany. What won their hearts was the political\r\nliberalism to which she gave expression in her letters, and with which\r\nshe in vain tried to imbue the sage who sat aloof in Weimar, her ardent\r\nadmiration for the brave resistance of the Tyrolese to the domination\r\nof France, her eager desire for the well-being of humanity, for the\r\nextermination of poverty and all the other ills of society. It made\r\na powerful impression when she, a worshipper of Goethe, but a more\r\nindependent-minded one than Rahel, extolled Beethoven's republicanism\r\nas greater, worthier than Goethe's submissive loyalty. She tries to\r\nbring Goethe and Beethoven together; she wishes she could send Wilhelm\r\nMeister to the Tyrol, to Andreas Hofer, that he might learn to feel\r\ngreater enthusiasm and to do manly deeds.\r\n\r\nIn the commencement of Frederick William's reign she was in favour at\r\ncourt. There was a frank, friendly intimacy between her and the king;\r\nshe had almost as much influence upon him as Humboldt, when there was\r\nany question of assisting talent or alleviating misery. But before long\r\nher feelings led her openly to declare socialistic principles. In 1843\r\nshe published _Dies Buch gehört dem König_ (\"This Book belongs to the\r\nKing\"), a work in which she calls upon Frederick William to relieve the\r\ndistress of his subjects. From her youth she had looked upon herself as\r\nthe natural champion and advocate of the distressed. \"The forsaken and\r\nunhappy possessed a magnetic attraction for her,\" says Hermann Grimm,\r\nwho, as her son-in-law, knew her intimately. Her natural inclination\r\nto help others, arid the early impressions made on her mind by the\r\nFrench Revolution, produced those political sympathies to which she\r\nunhesitatingly gave utterance, in the naïve expectation of receiving\r\nsupport from royalty.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, when the cholera raged in Berlin, she went fearlessly among\r\nthe sick and suffering. Judging from the hard lot of the Berlin working\r\nclasses, she came to the conclusion that the whole nation was in a bad\r\nway and in need of help. To her, liberty had always been a magic word.\r\nShe believed that whenever the words \"Let there be light!\" resounded\r\nfrom the right quarter, liberty would manifest itself, and all the\r\nfeelings and dreams of humanity would take shape in harmonious music,\r\nto the strains of which the peoples would march joyfully onwards.\r\n\r\nHer book, which in a little introductory parable she dedicates to\r\nthe king, is written in the form of conversations. Goethe's mother\r\nis the chief speaker. There is much warm feeling in the book, and a\r\nconsiderable amount of information on the subject of the distress among\r\nthe lower classes, but too little political insight to make it readable\r\nnowadays.\r\n\r\nThe authoress reaches a climax with the words: \"Our sign is the banner\r\nof liberty; its brightness lights up the black darkness of the times;\r\nits brilliancy dazzles and terrifies those who are on the shore, but\r\nwe are glad and rejoice.... Dangers? Liberty knows no dangers! To it\r\neverything is possible. The storm itself, the wildest of all storms,\r\nis the captain of our ship.\"[6]\r\n\r\nSuch sentiments were not likely to meet with a favourable reception\r\nat the Prussian court of that day. The book created a sensation, but\r\nput an end to the good understanding between Bettina and the king. It\r\nnaturally only increased the political discontent of the masses, and\r\na pretext was found for seizing her next book (on Clemens Brentano),\r\nbecause a repetition of the same sort of thing was feared.\r\n\r\nLong before this, however, Bettina had received the unanimous homage\r\nof the younger generation. Those interested should read Gutzkow's\r\naccount of his first visit to her, Mundt's description of her, Kühne's\r\npoetical appreciation. Even Robert Prutz, severe as he is on all the\r\nrepresentatives and models of Young Germany, numbers himself among her\r\nadmirers. \"Bettina's letters are,\" he says, \"the last bright blaze of\r\nRomanticism, the sparkling, crackling fireworks with which it closes\r\nits great festival; but they are at the same time the funeral pile\r\nupon which it consumes itself, the pillar of fire which rises from its\r\nashes--and shows us the way.\"\r\n\r\nThe third woman whose life and character made a deep impression on\r\nthe generation of 1830 was Charlotte Stieglitz, the daughter of a\r\nLeipzig merchant named Willhöft. As a child Charlotte was quiet and\r\nthoughtful, as a young girl there was something nun-like about her. In\r\n1822 Heinrich Stieglitz, then in his twenty-first year, came to Leipzig\r\nto study philology. From no fault of his own he had been mixed up in\r\nthe prosecution of the demagogues in Göttingen. He was a handsome young\r\nfellow, audacious, and, to judge by his looks, passionate; and he was a\r\npoet. Charlotte was then a beautiful girl of sixteen, whose appearance\r\nsuggested the possession of that supernatural quality which the Germans\r\nin olden days ascribed to those women whom they believed to possess the\r\ngift of prophecy. She had a high, open, intellectual forehead, curly\r\nbrown hair piled up in a tower-like coiffure, a thin, aquiline nose, a\r\nbeautiful mouth, large, star-like brown eyes that looked brightly and\r\nbravely out into the world. She spoke low, but sang with a full, clear\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nWhatever else modern poets may have neglected, they have not neglected\r\nto impress upon all, but more especially upon women, that a poet is a\r\nsuperior being. When Charlotte fell in love with the handsome young\r\nStieglitz, who was fascinated by her, she felt that she had learned\r\nwhat happiness is. The very idea of being the beloved of a poet, a\r\nreal, living poet, was bliss. And to this poet of hers she consecrated\r\nher every feeling, her every thought, from the first time she saw\r\nhim until, twelve years later, she stabbed herself to the heart for\r\nhis sake. Even before they were engaged, the desire was ever present\r\nwith her to be able, all unknown to him, to do something really\r\ndifficult, really great for him. She had the feminine helpfulness, the\r\nmotherliness, the housewifely understanding, and the brave cheerfulness\r\nwhich are among a woman's best qualities. The impression she produced\r\nwas that of gentle high-mindedness.\r\n\r\nAnd this noble woman was unfortunate enough to mistake an effeminate\r\nLeipzig student for the ideal man of her day-dreams--a poet of\r\ninferior, perfectly mediocre talent, for a great artist. In order to\r\nbe able to marry, Stieglitz was obliged to find employment. In 1827\r\nhe became a teacher in the Berlin Gymnasium and at the same time\r\nassistant librarian in the Royal Library, groaning immoderately over\r\nthe restraint imposed on him by these occupations. He was gloomy,\r\npassionate, eager to distinguish himself as a poet, but any artistic\r\ngift he had was purely bookish and unrealistic; he had no perseverance\r\nor power of resistance in the struggle of life, but was one of those\r\nwhom adversity prostrates. He had the outward appearance of a genius;\r\nin reality he was but a dull fellow.\r\n\r\nIt was a tragic misunderstanding on Charlotte's part. She believes\r\nthat he has an untamable, uncontrollable temperament. \"You need not\r\ndeny it,\" she writes; \"you ought to have been a brigand-chief.\" And\r\nshe calls him her dark, wild, poniard-wielder with the flashing eyes.\r\nDuring their long engagement they live in different towns. His letters\r\nare genial, natural, and affectionate; but one feels in them that he\r\nis not unhappy away from her. She, more warmblooded, pines for him,\r\nfor his personal presence. Hers was the uncontrollable temperament--he\r\nwas the genuine bookman, as unlike a robber-chief as any librarian on\r\nthe face of the earth. About the same time as Victor Hugo in France,\r\nhe feels the poetical attraction of the East, and, sitting in his\r\nlibrary, makes as careful a study as he can of Oriental literature and\r\ncivilisation. From this study result the _Bilder des Orients_, three\r\nvolumes produced with much toil and trouble. There is a great deal of\r\npretty and graphic writing in them, and it was unjust that they were\r\nso entirely overlooked; but the feeling which animates these Turkish\r\nand Persian poems, these Stamboul tragedies and scenes from Ispahan,\r\nthese more than passable verses on the Greek war of liberation, is too\r\ncommonplace, too tame; the marked individuality, the savagery which\r\nCharlotte saw in Heinrich Stieglitz is exactly what is wanting in them.\r\nIt is all too literary.\r\n\r\nShortly before their marriage in 1828, Charlotte, at her _fiancé's_\r\nrequest, bought a poniard for him to wear on their wedding tour, the\r\nweapon with which, six years later, she took her own life. It was\r\nbut a short time of unmixed happiness that she enjoyed after their\r\nmarriage. But she completely identifies herself with her husband, and\r\nis miserable because he, the genius, is compelled to spend so much of\r\nhis time and energy on his library work and teaching. She devotes much\r\nof hers to writing letters to their rich relations in Russia, who are\r\nministers and privy-councillors, and to other patrons and friends, in\r\nthe hope of improving his position. She encourages him indefatigably;\r\nshe knows every one of his poems by heart, parodies one of them with\r\naffectionate playfulness. A certain scene in his tragedy, _Selim\r\nIII._, is costing him much time and trouble. One day when he comes\r\nhome, she leads him smilingly to his desk, where he finds it lying,\r\ncompleted--the fine scene between the Sultan's mother and the physician\r\nin the Third Act.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time there came over her what she calls her\r\nchampagne-mood; she grieves that this is no longer the case with him.\r\nShe writes a poem to him, with a present of six quills, exhorting him\r\nto be energetic and determined, and not to reflect too long before he\r\nbegins:\r\n\r\n  \"Giess ein Füllhorn aus mit Früchten,\r\n     Blüth und Früchte gieb zugleich,\r\n   Weisheit sei in deinem Dichten,\r\n     Witz und Jugend mach' es reich.\r\n\r\n   Menschen lass uns drinnen finden,\r\n     Menschen die gelebt, gedacht,\r\n   Lass von Lieb' dich warm entzünden\r\n     Und von Zorns Gewitternacht.\"[7]\r\n\r\nShe firmly believes in the existence of mighty Titanic thoughts and\r\nimaginations in his soul, which it is difficult for him to persuade his\r\nlips to utter. Alas! he is not only uncommunicative, he is barren, and\r\non the verge of insanity, at times possibly over the verge. He listens\r\nto her exhortations with indifference. She writes: \"O Heinrich, for\r\nGod's sake let us be inconsistent at times, let us blaze up wildly,\r\ndespair madly, rise to the bliss of heaven, sink to the depths of\r\nhell--anything but be stolidly indifferent!\" We feel the spiritual\r\nkinswoman, the admirer of Rahel, in these words.\r\n\r\nHarassed by the drudgery of his daily life, troubled by the sterility\r\nof his overrated talent, he was sometimes irritable, sometimes gloomily\r\nstolid. She tries every means to brace him. At one time she fancies\r\nthat he is too lonely, that he requires the stimulation of more female\r\nsociety--and she is not jealous. She writes (October 1834): \"I wish,\r\nHeinrich, that you could have more intercourse, either personal or\r\nby correspondence, with clever, womanly women. They are the poet's\r\ntrue public. It would be of interest to you to learn, frankly and\r\ntruthfully, what they think of you and your works. Such intercourse\r\nwould be both instructive and refreshing, a useful and agreeable\r\ndiversion for you.\"\r\n\r\nShe is determined that they are to travel, to go far afield. He throws\r\nup his appointments and they go off to St. Petersburg and Finland. But\r\nit is all in vain.\r\n\r\nAs she and Stieglitz stood looking at the waterfall of Imatra in\r\nFinland, in July 1833, she spoke the following memorable words: \"Is\r\nnot this like a great thought which has strayed into these mountain\r\nsolitudes? Feelings like mighty billows, thunderstorms, a hurricane,\r\nwould be a suitable accompaniment to this tumbling, foaming water. How\r\npoor the song about the little violet would sound here, pretty as it is\r\nin itself! Like the mighty waterfall, this foaming, wildly excited time\r\ncries for mighty song. You will give what it demands....\"\r\n\r\nIn October 1835, when he was making perpetual complaint of the small\r\npin-pricks of life, she said to him (as he himself has noted): \"My\r\ncareful observation of you has led me to the conclusion that whoever\r\nwishes to do you real service must provide a real, great sorrow for\r\nyou. Nothing would do you so much good as that; nothing would so surely\r\nbring out your powers.\"\r\n\r\nLike most people whose minds are affected, Stieglitz had periods of\r\nviolent excitement, after which he relapsed into his ordinary state of\r\nsilent, almost animal-like brooding. Once when they were on a walking\r\ntour, he was so lost in his own thoughts, so indifferent to all else,\r\nthat she left him and went off by herself, hoping that this would rouse\r\nhim; but he did not even notice it. It was a kind of warning that her\r\n_final_ desertion of him would be of no avail; but it was a warning\r\nthat she did not understand.\r\n\r\nEntirely possessed by the latest ideas of the day, persuaded that a\r\npoet ought to live in the world, to influence and be influenced by it,\r\nit was her constant desire to drive him to action. She said to him one\r\nday: \"I long for your spiritual regeneration. You will be born again! I\r\nknow you will! Would that I could hasten that birth--even if it were by\r\nartificial means! But how if my surgical operation miscarried!\" And in\r\nDecember 1834 she writes in her diary that Goethe's life becomes fuller\r\nfrom the moment that Schiller enters into it, but that Goethe ought to\r\nhave profited more by his friend's death, and would have done so, if he\r\nhad not, according to his custom, determinedly refused to sorrow; if he\r\nhad allowed the sorrow to enter into him, to become part of himself,\r\nthe result would have been a renewal of youth as far as his poetical\r\nproductivity was concerned.\r\n\r\nIt was in this same month of December, 1834, that Stieglitz's disgust\r\nwith life reached a sort of climax. His malady took the form of\r\nintellectual stagnation, of absolute incapacity to express himself.\r\nCharlotte begged him, as if he had been a child, rather to rave and\r\nstorm as of old than to collapse in this terrible manner; but she\r\nbegged in vain. It was then that she determined to employ the last\r\nmeans in her power, to take that step which she, with her innocent,\r\nhigh-flown ideas, felt it obligatory to take, in order that a great,\r\nsimple sorrow might enter into his life, reawaken his genius, and give\r\nhis poetry new themes.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 29th she came home, knowing that she would have\r\ntwo hours to herself, threw her short fur cape and boa on the hall\r\nfloor, hurried into her bedroom, locked the door of communication with\r\nthe kitchen, undressed, washed herself, put on a clean night-dress,\r\nwrote a few lines to Heinrich expressing her belief that new life for\r\nhim would arise out of this misfortune, and exhorting him no longer to\r\nbe weak, but calm and strong and great. Then she lay down on the bed\r\nand with a firm hand plunged the dagger of their wedding tour into her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne's first impression is that these women, Rahel, Bettina, and\r\nCharlotte, who all three became famous in the year 1835, have nothing\r\nin common. Rahel dies in 1833 at the age of sixty-one, and her real\r\nlife-work, the first energetic vindication of Goethe's pre-eminence,\r\nbelongs quite as much to the eighteenth as to the nineteenth century.\r\nBettina, who is fourteen years younger, does not come before the public\r\ntill a year after Rahel's death; she combines the exalted enthusiasm\r\nand the unreality of Romanticism with the reforming tendencies of Young\r\nGermany. Charlotte's only achievement was to kill herself, a thing\r\nwhich has been done by women times without number, though probably\r\nnever for the same reason.\r\n\r\nBut when we look a little deeper, we find that they have many traits\r\nin common. They are all restless, with the restlessness distinctive of\r\ntheir day, which manifests itself, not in outward hurry and strain,\r\nbut in strong emotions, not in the nervousness prevalent in our own\r\nday, but in perpetual introspection. Then there is the peculiarity that\r\nnone of them transgress the laws of society, though none of them have\r\nany respect for these laws. And there is the wonderful, ideal fidelity\r\nwhich they all display. Rahel is Goethe's, from the first breath she\r\ndraws as a grown-up woman to her last. Bettina is Goethe's, with such\r\nabsorbing devotion that the scheme of erecting a colossal monument to\r\nhim which she advocated in her first published work (a monument which\r\nshe herself planned and had executed in miniature), becomes in her old\r\nage an _idée fixe_. Charlotte so entirely belongs to the man on whom\r\nher choice falls when she is sixteen, that she not only lives for him,\r\nbut dies for him.\r\n\r\nAnother thing they have in common is enthusiasm. Rahel's burns like a\r\nsteady, sacred flame; Bettina's breaks out in a pyrotechnic display\r\nof ideas and visions; Charlotte's manifests itself in the resolute,\r\nuncomplaining sacrifice of her life. It is genius that they all\r\nworship; they have the enthusiastic German appreciation of poetic\r\ngenius; their great desire is to do what in them lies to promote its\r\nrecognition and glorification, or its development and emancipation;\r\nto this task they devote their lives, regardless of the worthiness or\r\nunworthiness of the object of their choice. Lastly, the thoughts and\r\nfeelings of all three are remarkably original. These women resemble\r\nno other women. Never, to our knowledge, has there been such another\r\nreflective emotionalist as Rahel, such another sylph-like enthusiast as\r\nBettina, such another suicide as Charlotte's, a suicide inspired by a\r\nlofty though false æsthetic principle.\r\n\r\nThose who look deeper into the matter and view these characters in the\r\nlight of history, see in Rahel's introspection and self-reflection,\r\nthe first form which woman's self-emancipation necessarily took in\r\nthe Germany of this century; this height of intellectual independence\r\nhad to be attained before the women in a country where they for\r\ncenturies had been relegated to simple domesticity could rise to\r\nanything above it. In Bettina's triple enthusiasm, for Goethe, for\r\nthe ideas of political liberalism, and for social reform, the student\r\nof history descries the transition stage between the era of art and\r\nthe era of liberalism and socialism. And in Charlotte's suicide he\r\nsees an expression of the desire of the women of her day to snatch\r\nthe men from their literary quietism and place them face to face with\r\nthe seriousness, the tragedy of life. The whole era speaks when she\r\nsays to Stieglitz that the song of the violet cannot be sung to the\r\naccompaniment of a great waterfall. None of these women could have\r\ndeveloped as they did at any other period, and at no other period\r\nwould they have been understood and appreciated as they were. To-day,\r\nalready, we find it difficult to understand them.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic that the word _work_ finds no place in the\r\ndescription of their lives. They never learned anything methodically,\r\nand in their fear of being unfeminine are proud of this--as we observed\r\nin the case of Rahel. Even that accomplished linguist, Henriette Herz,\r\nis deeply offended because Jean Paul in one of his letters used the\r\nexpression, \"M. Herz and his learned wife.\" Charlotte Stieglitz has\r\nnot the faintest idea that talent is developed by work, by obstinate\r\nindustry, and not by bereavements. And Bettina, the bayadere, who\r\nimitates Mignon's egg-dance, has nothing whatever to do with work.\r\nThis fact impresses itself on us when we are annoyed by the slovenly\r\ncomposition and the want of any real understanding of politics in her\r\nbook for the king.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1848 it began to be recognised that all this\r\nintellectuality would have been more solid, more real, more lasting,\r\nif these women had known something, had followed some course of study,\r\ntaken up one or other branch of science. All this soaring thought would\r\nhave been doubly valuable if it had in the first place been subjected\r\nto regular discipline. To soar without previous training is often\r\nmere waste of power. If Rahel had had a solid foundation of knowledge\r\nto build upon, she would have had a very different influence upon\r\nposterity. As it is, her ideas, obscure and lucid, chaff and seed-corn,\r\nare scattered to the winds.\r\n\r\nIn the Thirties men still believed in an inspiration that could\r\ndispense with knowledge, in a morality of the heart which rendered any\r\nreform of the old social morality unnecessary, in a defiance of law\r\nwhich allowed all laws to hold good, but kept clear of them all. This\r\nstate of matters Young Germany was bent upon altering.\r\n\r\nDuring the Forties men had arrived at the persuasion that there was\r\nsomething of greater value than sudden inspiration and a life of pure\r\nintellectuality. There was humble and daring work to be done in science\r\nand in politics. We see German philosophy develop in the direction of\r\nradicalism, and we come upon poets whose aim it is to prepare the way\r\nfor political liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Karl Hillebrand: _Zeiten, Völker und Menschen_, ii. 5. _Aus dem\r\nunzünftigen Schriftthum Deutschlands.--La société de Berlin.

Yet another generation had\r\narisen, a generation which owed its profoundest culture to Hegel,\r\nand which, strangely enough, he had influenced chiefly in the\r\ndirection of politics. Schelling in his day had declared art to be the\r\nhighest manifestation of intellect. His principle, and that of the\r\nRomanticists, was that the artist is the true man. What art had been to\r\nSchelling, history was to Hegel--history, that eternal progress of the\r\nidea of liberty, that great liberty-epic. And what the work of art had\r\nbeen to Schelling, the State was to Hegel. To him the true, the perfect\r\nhuman being is not the artist, but the citizen of a constitutional\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThis youngest generation was inspired by the Hegelian philosophy to\r\nmake the reform of the State its aim. It held the adherents of the\r\nYoung German school in light esteem, being of opinion that they had\r\nnot stood bravely by their colours, either in philosophy or politics,\r\nthat they were too belletristic, too epicurean. It would not join in\r\nthe old cry for the rehabilitation of the flesh, would not even listen\r\nto it. Heine, in _Atta Troll_, had told the young generation that a\r\nman of character without talent was no better than a bear; the young\r\nmen retorted that a man of talent without character was nothing but a\r\nmonkey--possibly a very amusing monkey, but nothing more.\r\n\r\nThat the Hegelian philosophy had again become a guiding principle was\r\nmade plain when the periodical known as the _Hallische Jahrbücher_\r\nwas brought out by Ruge and Echtermeyer in 1838. This organ of the\r\nHegelians of the Left disseminated the ideas which moulded not only\r\nthe politicians but also the poets of the day. In all essentials the\r\nprinciples were the same as those in whose name Young Germany had taken\r\nthe field, but they were now proclaimed with more scientific precision\r\nand more resoluteness. The elder men had to choose between joining the\r\nYoung Hegelians and reprobating the principles of their own youth, as\r\nnow proclaimed by others. As was only natural, they did not recognise\r\ntheir own opinions as propounded by these bellicose youths, and there\r\nwas many a collision between the youngest generation and Gutzkow,\r\nLaube, and Mundt.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the State now became the central idea of the day, the idea\r\nof the State as a living organism, realised in the consciousness of\r\nall its citizens. In the many philosophical, theological, æsthetic\r\nfeuds waged by this new generation, the State and the necessity for\r\nits reform is always the burden of their cry. This was the season of\r\npreparation for that absorption in the idea of the State which is so\r\ncharacteristic of the Germany of later days, and which caused even a\r\nrevolutionary (but a Hegelian revolutionary) like Lassalle to exclaim:\r\n\"Do not malign the State! The State is God!\" It is a sign of the nature\r\nof the literary development that the _Hallische Jahrbücher_ began as\r\na philosophical, but was suppressed as a political periodical.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] _Cf_. R. Prütz: _Vorlesungen über die deutsche Litteratur der\r\nGegenwart_.\r\n\r\nThe new political ideas with which the nation was impregnated presently\r\nbroke forth in poetry and song. The first political poetry appears in\r\nthe same year as the _Jahrbücher_, and spreads political free-thought\r\nin far wider circles. At first it was for the most part rhetorical, and\r\ndevoid of artistic value, but the common national feeling of the German\r\ncountries had slumbered so long that the mere watch-words \"liberty\" and\r\n\"fatherland\" produced an electrical effect.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of June 1840, Frederick William IV. ascended the throne of\r\nPrussia. The new king presented in every respect a marked contrast to\r\nthe man who, succeeding in 1797, had wielded the Prussian scepter for\r\nforty-two years. Frederick William III. had been the born soldier;\r\nhis son was an artist by nature, with mediocre half-suppressed\r\ntalents, a dilettante in art and science. The father had been a sober,\r\nmodest, steadfast character; the son was a fanciful enthusiast, as\r\nimpressionable as a woman. The father had been the devotee of duty,\r\nan upright, dry, narrow-minded man, the son was full of romantic\r\nideas, clever, famous for his witty sallies. The father had been tall,\r\nslender, soldierlike, in his bearing and dress; the son had soft,\r\nrounded features, not unlike Queen Louisa's, was fat rather than\r\nmuscular, quick and jerky in his movements, communicative, sociable,\r\nvery talkative. The father had been a reliable man, the son was an\r\ninteresting one.\r\n\r\nThough Frederick William IV., as Crown Prince, had had the best of\r\ninstructors in all the branches of a military education, he did not\r\ntake the lead in military matters. He was fond of calling himself a\r\nPrussian officer, but the strict, pedantic discipline inseparable from\r\nmilitary service in time of peace, was wearisome to him, and at times\r\nhe, a Hohenzollern, was even known to jeer at State parades. Now and\r\nagain, however, it happened that he grew wildly enthusiastic. At a\r\nreview, the music, the clash of weapons, the loud commands, the firing,\r\nproduced in him a sort of poetic excitement. Carried away by military\r\nenthusiasm, he once, on the occasion of a big sham-fight, led the\r\ntroops right into Berlin, regardless of the confusion thereby produced,\r\nand of the hundreds of window-panes shattered by the volleys fired in\r\nthe streets.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] Prutz: _Zehn Jahre_, i.\r\n\r\nBut for the most part it was with men of science and artists that\r\nthe Crown Prince consorted--scholars such as Humboldt, historians\r\nlike Ranke, painters like Cornelius, sculptors like Rauch. He was\r\nmuch interested in architecture, made a study of the antique styles\r\nin their application to ecclesiastical architecture of the Byzantine\r\ntype, sketched plans, tried to produce imposing effects by means\r\nof colonnades and halls. He projected ideal landscapes, resembling\r\nscenes on the Italian shores of the Mediterranean. He criticised\r\nmusic and poetry. He specially encouraged and patronised the study of\r\nancient German customs and of all ancient art which had devoted itself\r\nto the service of religion; and all this occupation with the past\r\nincreased his distaste for the time in which he lived, and developed\r\nhis inclination to restore the old order of things, or at any rate to\r\noppose reforms inspired by the modern spirit.\r\n\r\nThis inclination could not but be strengthened by the young prince's\r\nintercourse with clergymen, and with the small circle of romantically\r\ndisposed aristocrats who were his familiar associates. From his\r\nchildhood he had been religious. As a boy he had, during the war with\r\nNapoleon, learnt to believe in the sacredness of the old system of\r\ngovernment, in the divine right of kings, and in the mission of Austria\r\nas heir of the Holy Roman Empire. He adopted the whole system of ideas\r\nand enthusiasms of which Joseph de Maistre was the first and ablest\r\nexponent. He studied Haller's _Restauration der Staatswissenschaft_.\r\nEre long he came to look upon the crown as a mystic jewel, a\r\ncombination of the priestly fillet of old with the dictator's golden\r\nwreath; the kingly office became in his eyes a sacred calling, the king\r\nhimself a divinely inspired being. His ideal was a patriarchal relation\r\nbetween the king and his people, much the same ideal as that which was\r\naimed at during the same period by the so-called Young England, the\r\nfollowers of Disraeli.\r\n\r\nFrederick William IV. was received by his people with all the confident\r\nexpectation with which a nation that is still in its political\r\nchildhood welcomes a new king. They believed of him what is believed\r\nof all crown princes, that his principles were more liberal than his\r\nfather's. The hopes and expectations of the nation surrounded him\r\nwith a sort of halo. He began, as kings are wont to do, with an act\r\nwhich appeared to justify the popular estimate of his character; he\r\nproclaimed a general amnesty for political offences. This led all to\r\nhope that he would fulfil the political desire of the country, that he\r\nwould confer on Prussia that benefit which was regarded as a necessary\r\ncondition of all progress, constitutional government.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the Prussian people were in possession of a\r\ndistinct, definite, royal promise of a constitution, a promise the\r\nfulfilment of which had been dishonestly delayed. This made their\r\nhope all the stronger; they felt sure that this promise would now be\r\nredeemed.\r\n\r\nSoon after the new king's accession, the Estates of the Provinces of\r\nPosen and East and West Prussia were summoned to meet at Königsberg,\r\nfor the purpose of paying homage to him. The Estates of East and\r\nWest Prussia replied to the announcement of this meeting by sending\r\nin a most humble petition to the king, in which they besought him\r\nto maintain and to complete the system of representative government\r\ninaugurated by his glorious father, who, in this as in all else\r\nfaithful to his promise, had introduced representative government in\r\nthe provinces, but had left the completion of the work to his royal\r\nsuccessor \"whom the nation loves with the truest devotion, and on whom\r\nits dearest hopes are set\" (in welchem die treueste Liebe und die\r\ninnigsten Wünsche des Landes sich begegnen).\r\n\r\nThe lower classes of citizens, all those who hoped that their\r\ntrades and industries would profit by the approaching festivities\r\nat Königsberg, were highly incensed by this proceeding, which they\r\nconsidered calculated to offend the king. The higher classes, on\r\nthe contrary, imagined that their gifted monarch would at once\r\ngladly accede to the legitimate desire of his people; no one was\r\nin a better position than he to understand the defects of the old\r\nsystem of representation. But neither those who dreaded an outburst\r\nof royal indignation nor those who expected a manifestation of royal\r\nliberal-mindedness proved to be right.\r\n\r\nFrederick William's vague answer was to the effect that the\r\nconstitution of the Estates rested upon a national, historic\r\nfoundation, that the king took a deep interest in the said institution,\r\nthat he was firmly determined to pursue the path entered on by his\r\npredecessors, and that his faithful Estates might \"place absolute\r\nconfidence in his intentions\" with regard to the institution of the\r\nLandtag (Parliament).\r\n\r\nLittle of positive assurance as there was in this message, it was\r\nreceived with joy; it relieved one party from the dread of a stern\r\nrebuff, and encouraged the sanguine hopes of the other. The festival at\r\nKönigsberg went off successfully, and was marked by general enthusiasm.\r\nIts most imposing incident occurred immediately after the deputies\r\nhad repeated, word for word, the oath of allegiance read out to them.\r\nHardly had the echo of the loud Amen pronounced by the four hundred\r\nvoices died away, when the king was seen to rise from the throne, which\r\nstood upon an open balcony, come forward to the rails, raise his arm\r\nas if he were taking an oath, and begin to address the assembly. Every\r\nword of his speech was clearly audible. He promised to be a just judge,\r\na faithful, painstaking, and merciful ruler, a Christian king like his\r\never-to-be-remembered father. The concluding sentence bears witness to\r\nhis literary gift: \"May God preserve our Prussian fatherland, for its\r\nown sake, for Germany's, and for the world's--our fatherland, which is\r\nmade up of many parts, and yet is one whole, like that noble metal, a\r\nmixture of many others, but itself one metal, liable to no rust but the\r\nbeautifying rust of centuries!\"\r\n\r\nAstonishment that a King of Prussia should thus of his own free will\r\ngive a promise to his people in return for theirs to him, combined with\r\nthe impression produced by this ostensibly improvised address from such\r\nan animated and winning royal personage, to create a feeling of excited\r\njubilation. Above on the balcony the queen burst into tears, down below\r\nthe people wept, smiled through their tears, and pressed each other's\r\nhands. In the transport of the moment it was not observed that there\r\nwas no definite political promise in the speech, nothing but liberal\r\ngeneralities and romantic phraseology.\r\n\r\nBut the Königsberg festival was only a prelude to the great one held\r\nin Berlin. In the minds of the inhabitants of his capital a halo of\r\ngolden promises still surrounded the person of the king. They were\r\ndetermined to do everything in their power to show their devotion, and\r\nto give the festival a character that was likely to be agreeable to\r\nhim. The military element was not allowed to preponderate; something\r\nin the style of a medieval German municipal pageant was aimed at.\r\nThe different guilds, numbering in all about 10,000 men, marched in\r\nprocession, carrying their banners and emblems. As an agreeable little\r\nsurprise for the king, a great projecting piece of masonry at the\r\nRathaus (town hall) with which his carriage had come into collision one\r\nday when he was Crown Prince, was altogether removed.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between the two festivals an incident occurred which\r\ncould not but awaken in the mind of the nation a suspicion of the\r\nking's fickleness. On the 4th of October 1840, a royal order in council\r\nwas published which intimated, to prevent any misunderstanding, that\r\nthe king, in expressing his appreciation of the loyalty of the Estates,\r\nhad by no means declared himself to be in favour of a representative\r\nconstitution as formulated in the ordinance of the 22nd of May.\r\n\r\nThe princes and nobles were to take the oath of allegiance in the\r\npalace, the citizens were to pay homage in the great square outside the\r\nso-called Lustgarten. But from early morning rain fell in torrents. For\r\ntwo whole hours the citizens stood outside the square, getting soaked\r\nthrough, whilst the king listened, indoors, to the speeches of princes,\r\nnobles, and clergy, and gave the rein to his own eloquence.\r\n\r\nAt last he stepped out on the balcony. But on this occasion people were\r\nprepared to hear him speak; there was no question of improvisation.\r\nBerlin would have felt itself insulted if the king, who had made a\r\nspeech at Königsberg, had received its homage in silence. And speak he\r\ndid. Every one could see the motion of his hands, but the size of the\r\nsquare and the sound of the wind and the rain prevented his words being\r\nheard. Every time he stopped speaking, the attentive crowd, imagining\r\nthat the speech was concluded, broke forth in loud acclamation; but\r\nthe king waved his hand, and proceeded. The rain poured, but still\r\nhe spoke. All watched his gesticulations. Four times the multitude\r\nshouted \"Hurrah!\" in the belief that he had done, and four times he\r\nbegan again. He promised to rule as one who feared God and loved man,\r\nwith his eyes open when attending to the needs of the people and of\r\nthe times, closed when called on to do justice--but the antithesis\r\nwas lost in the whistle of the wind and the rush of the rain. He\r\nshouted: \"Will you promise, while I am striving so to do, to stand\r\nby me, in prosperity and in adversity? If so, give an answer in that\r\nplainest, finest word of our mother-tongue, an honest 'Ja!'\" Shouts\r\nof \"Bravo! bravo!\" from the square. They thought he had finished. But\r\nthe king waved his hand and continued. At last he concluded by turning\r\nthe downpour of rain to account in his peroration, by taking it as a\r\nfavourable omen--though this also was lost on the audience. \"So help me\r\nGod, I will keep the promises which I have made here and at Königsberg!\r\nIn sign hereof I raise my right hand to heaven. Proceed we now with our\r\nhigh festival, and may God's blessing fall like his fertilising rain\r\nupon us this day!\"\r\n\r\nBut God's fertilising rain completely extinguished the festive spirit,\r\npoured its chilling prose over both audience and orator.\r\n\r\nNo one could observe that any promises were kept, but neither could any\r\none name any particular promises that had been made by his Majesty. The\r\nnew king and his government soon showed themselves in their true light.\r\n\r\nEichhorn was nominated Minister of Public Worship (_Kultusminister_)\r\nin place of the late Count Altenstein, the patron of Hegel and the\r\nHegelians. Eichhorn had already shown Pietistic leanings; it was\r\nreported that he intended to introduce strict regulations regarding the\r\nobservation of holy-days, and possibly also rules of church discipline\r\nbinding on all Government officials. The indignation roused by this\r\nreport was so great that advantage was taken of the first possible\r\nopportunity to display it. Racine's _Athalie_ was put on the stage by\r\nthe king's special request. There was no fault to be found with the\r\nplay itself, but it had a religious subject and had been originally\r\nwritten for the inmates of a convent. On the occasion of its first\r\nperformance, January 4th, 1841, it was hissed by the audience, a\r\ndemonstration the meaning of which every one understood. People were\r\nmuch more exasperated with the minister than with the king; for no one\r\ndoubted that the king was a sincerely religious man, whereas the life\r\nEichhorn had lived and the company he had kept led them to conclude\r\nthe opposite of him. And when it came to his making public use of the\r\nexpression, \"the Christian state,\" that is the state of which the\r\nunorthodox cannot be reckoned true citizens, war was waged against this\r\n\"square circle,\" as the expression was called, with all the weapons of\r\nsober earnest and of mockery. Unfortunately the king had, a few months\r\nbefore this, in one of his fits of political liberalism, possibly\r\ninfluenced by his appreciation of wit, abolished the censorship of\r\ncaricature-drawing. So now Eichhorn was to be seen everywhere, in the\r\nshape of a squirrel (_Eichhorn_ = squirrel) gnawing leaves, cracking\r\nthe empty nut of the Christian Church, &c., &c. The ungrateful\r\ncaricaturists did not even respect the king; and Heine, the greatest\r\ncaricaturist of the age, ridiculed royal indecision in the following\r\nlines of _Der neue Alexander_:\r\n\r\n   \"Ich ward ein Zwitter, ein Mittelding, das weder Fleisch noch Fisch ist,\r\n   Das von den Extremen unserer Zeit ein närrisches Gemisch ist.\r\n   Ich bin nicht schlecht, ich bin nicht gut, nicht dumm und nicht gescheute,\r\n   Und wenn ich gestern vorwärts ging, so geh ich rückwärts heute.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[3] I'm neither fish nor flesh, neither this nor that, but a queer\r\ncompound of the extremes of the day; I'm not bad, I'm not good, not\r\nstupid and not clever; if I walked forwards yesterday, I'll walk\r\nbackwards to-day.\r\n\r\nBut Eichhorn was not content with Christianising the State, he aimed\r\nat Christianising science. He was particularly desirous to oust known\r\nHegelians from all good and influential appointments, the Hegelian\r\nphilosophy being distasteful to the king, because it left no play for\r\nhis imagination.\r\n\r\nIt was by the king's wish that Schelling was brought from Munich\r\nto Berlin to fill the professorial chair left vacant by the death\r\nof Hegel, that from that vantage ground he might propound his new\r\nphilosophy, that _Philosophie der Offenbarung_ (Philosophy of\r\nRevelation) which, like some quack remedy, had been kept secret\r\nfor years, and yet puffed as if it were to introduce a new era. He\r\nreceived a larger salary than had ever before been given to a Prussian\r\nuniversity professor (it was declared that he was almost as well\r\npaid as a _premiere danseuse_); and it was certainly not the king's\r\nfault that, in spite of all Schelling's endeavours, there seemed no\r\npossibility of eradicating Hegelian unorthodoxy. As a matter of fact,\r\nSchelling was a failure. He could not but feel that he was regarded\r\nwith contempt by the whole youth of a nation. Ch. Kapp wrote a clever\r\ndescription of the court thinker's various metamorphoses since the\r\ndays of his youth, his apostasy from himself, the humbug in his\r\nreconciliation of faith and thought; and Ludwig Feuerbach, in his\r\nenergetic language, styled him the philosophical Cagliostro of the\r\nnineteenth century, and his philosophy a theosophic farce.\r\n\r\nEichhorn proceeded to take a variety of measures to counteract the\r\nprogress of science. He set a fixed limit to the number of teachers\r\nat all the different Prussian universities, thereby reducing the\r\nnumber of private lecturers and increasing the influence of the\r\nGovernment. Professor Hoffman (von Fallersleben) was dismissed from\r\nthe University of Breslau, because of some harmless jests at politics\r\nin his _Unpolitical Songs_--jovial, catching verses, which so exactly\r\nchimed in with the Liberal ideas of the middle-class citizen that\r\nthey alarmed the authorities. The Biblical critic, Bruno Bauer's, two\r\nbooks on the authenticity of the Four Gospels cost him his post of\r\nlecturer at the University of Bonn. The servile Faculties carried out\r\nthe wishes of the Government: they approved of free scientific inquiry,\r\nbut could not approve of Bruno Bauer as a lecturer on _theology_. The\r\nHegelian theologian, Marheineke of Berlin, undauntedly declared that\r\nhe, too, was desirous that Bruno Bauer should be relieved from his\r\npost as lecturer, because he considered that such an eminent critic,\r\na man of such thorough scientific training, should be promoted to a\r\nreally influential appointment. But Bauer's fate was sealed. The Halle\r\nstudents petitioned that David Strauss might be appointed professor at\r\ntheir university. The answer to their petition was a reprimand, and\r\nthe three students whose names headed the list of petitioners were\r\nexpelled. After Gans's death, the noted reactionary Stahl (author\r\nof _Umkehr der Wissenschaft_) was appointed to his professorship\r\nin Berlin. It was somewhat humiliating for the Government that the\r\nstudents refused to listen to Stahl's first lecture; they drummed him\r\nout of the lecture-room.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1841 there appeared in Switzerland a little book,\r\nentitled _Gedichte eines Lebendigen_ (\"Poems of a Living Man\"). It\r\ncontained many an astounding verse; among others:\r\n\r\n   \"Reisst die Kreuze aus der Erden!\r\n    Alle sollen Schwerter werden!\r\n      Gott im Himmel wird's verzeihn.\r\n    Lasst, o lasst das Verseschweissen,\r\n    Auf den Amboss legt das Eisen,\r\n      Heiland soll das Eisen sein.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[4]\r\n\r\n    Tear the crosses from the graves;\r\n    'Tis the sword alone that saves;\r\n      God forgives the deed ye do.\r\n    Leave, oh leave your rhyming trade;\r\n    Steel on anvil must be laid--\r\n      Steel shall bring us safely through.\r\n                               (JOYNES.)\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n\r\n  \"Brause, Gott, mit Sturmesodem durch die fürchterliche Stille,\r\n   Gieb ein Trauerspiel der Freiheit für der Sklaverei Idylle!\r\n   Lass das Herz doch wieder schlagen in der Brust der kalten Welt\r\n   Und erweck ihr einen Rächer und erweck ihr einen Held!\"[5]\r\n\r\n[5] Let thy tempest blow, O God, and put an end to this terrible calm!\r\nGive us a tragedy of liberty in place of this idyll of slavery! Set\r\nthe heart of the clay-cold world beating again; raise up for her an\r\navenger; awaken for her a hero!\r\n\r\nThe collection was prefaced by a poetical challenge \"To the Dead Man,\"\r\nnamely Prince Pückler, who had written under this pseudonym. He was\r\nchosen as the representative of the careless pleasure-lovers who seek\r\ndistraction in travel. The attack was unjust, but how fine it sounded!\r\n\r\nThe anonymous author, whose name soon became public property, was a\r\nyoung man of twenty-four, Georg Herwegh, born in Würtemberg in 1817,\r\nand educated at the well-known Tübingen Institution. While serving his\r\ntime in the army, Herwegh quarrelled with an officer, and was obliged\r\nto take refuge in Switzerland, where he lived for several years,\r\nassociating with other refugees and other youthful Radicals. His poems,\r\nwith their fresh, energetic, and yet vague Radicalism, at once made\r\ntheir mark, and attained an immense circulation in the course of a few\r\nmonths. The sentiment of these poems is somewhat mixed. Now it is with\r\ntyrants, now with Philistines, that their author is at war; at one\r\ntime he discovers the enemies of the good cause in Germany itself, at\r\nanother abroad; now he writes as a staunch Republican; again, following\r\nthe example of Platen, he appeals earnestly, imploringly to the King of\r\nPrussia, warning him, but at the same time assuring him that it is not\r\ntoo late:\r\n\r\n   \"Du bist der Stern, auf den man schaut,\r\n    Der letzte Fürst, auf den man baut.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[6]\r\n\r\n    Thou art the star to which we turn our eyes,\r\n    Of monarchs all the last in whom our hope yet lies.\r\n\r\nThe public of that day overlooked the young poet's want of consistency;\r\nhis enthusiasm was infectious, his melodious lyrical rhetoric\r\nirresistible. He was the first lyric poet who had taken men's hearts\r\nby storm since the days of Goethe and Schiller. From the Alps to the\r\nBaltic the young men sang: _Reisst die Kreuze aus der Erden!_\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1842 Herwegh took a tour through Germany, with a\r\npractical aim in view. The work which he had begun as a poet, he\r\ndesired to carry on as a journalist, a political writer; his journey\r\nwas undertaken for the purpose of securing contributors to a monthly\r\nmagazine to be entitled _Der deutsche Bote aus der Schweiz_ (\"The\r\nGerman Messenger from Switzerland\"); but it became a sort of triumphal\r\nprogress; he was entertained at banquets in Cologne and Leipzig, and\r\nserenaded by the students of Jena; never before had such homage been\r\npaid to a German poet.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of October he arrived in Berlin, where he could not\r\nexpect to make as great a sensation, especially as he had followed\r\nthe advice of his companion, Ruge, and refused the advances of a very\r\nunprosperous Radical association. But something happened which made\r\nfar more impression on the public mind than any popular demonstration\r\ncould have done--the king expressed a wish to make Herwegh's personal\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nSo far the only public manifestation of Frederick William's æsthetic\r\nsympathies had been his patronage of Tieck and Rückert, both of whom\r\nhe had invited to Berlin. Ludwig Tieck, now an old man, crippled with\r\nrheumatism, occasionally read aloud at Court and put plays on the\r\nstage; Friedrich Rückert was expected to assist in reorganising the\r\nstudy of Oriental languages at the University, but proved unfit for\r\nthe task. Unprejudiced judgment in literary matters was certainly not\r\ntraditional in the Hohenzollern family. There was only one possible\r\nprecedent for the audience granted to Herwegh, and that was to be found\r\nin the present king's own private reply to the ode in which Platen\r\nconjured him to embrace the cause of unhappy Poland. In a cordial\r\nletter to the poet, Frederick William, then Crown Prince, expressed\r\nhis hearty sympathy with the Poles and bewailed his inability to help.\r\nThe ode addressed by Herwegh to the king implored him to put down\r\nclericalism; it was an agreeable surprise to find that this had given\r\nno offence.\r\n\r\nThe audience took place on the 19th of November 1842. Herwegh was very\r\nsilent, depressed by the situation. The king was, as usual, eloquent\r\nand communicative. He is reported to have said: \"You are the second\r\nenemy whom I have received this year; the first was M. Thiers (who\r\nhad threatened war in 1840, because of the support given by the great\r\npowers to the Sultan in his quarrel with the Egyptian Pacha); but it\r\ngives me greater pleasure to see you. We have our vocations, you and\r\nI; mine is to be a king, yours to be a poet. I shall be faithful to\r\nmine, as I trust you will be to yours. Nothing is more abhorrent to\r\nme than vacillation; I esteem an Opposition which is actuated by real\r\nconviction (wenn sie nur gesinnungsvoll ist).\" Referring to Herwegh's\r\nyouth, he prophesied \"a Damascus day\" for him, concluding with the\r\nwords: \"Until then, let us be honourable enemies.\"\r\n\r\nSuch particulars of this meeting of king and poet as reached the\r\nears of the public awakened feelings either of childish envy or\r\nchildish indignation among the oppositionist writers of the day. It\r\nwas considered that Herwegh ought (_à la_ Marquis Posa) to have taken\r\nadvantage of the opportunity to demand political liberty for Prussia.\r\n\r\nA few days after the audience, Herwegh left Berlin. At Königsberg,\r\nwhere he was again entertained at a banquet, he was surprised to\r\nreceive the news that his projected periodical, before its appearance,\r\nhad been declared contraband in Prussia. It was a prohibition for which\r\nhe might well have been prepared, for all books published abroad (his\r\nown poems included) were contraband, except those for which special\r\nlicence had been granted. But already irritated by accusations of\r\ntreason brought against him in one and another Radical newspaper, he\r\nwas completely upset by this rebuff, and at once addressed an awkward,\r\nunmanly, would-be pathetic letter to the king.\r\n\r\nHe pleaded the king's promise of honourable enmity, a promise which he\r\ndeclared to be broken by this prohibition; he would not ask the king to\r\nrevoke this edict, though it was hard for him to see the child of his\r\nMuse menaced while yet in its mother's womb, and hard to have to live\r\nin a state of constant warfare with the law of the country; not that\r\nthe prohibition did him any harm, for he was fortunate enough to be at\r\nthat moment preparing the fifth edition of his poems, also a prohibited\r\nbook; but he felt impelled to address a last, honest, impassioned\r\nappeal to the king; an appeal which, though private, was not merely his\r\nown, but that of thousands, &c, &c.\r\n\r\nThe letter itself was stupid and indiscreet; its publication in a\r\nLeipzig newspaper a few weeks later was a piece of folly that avenged\r\nitself. In Stettin, Herwegh received orders to leave the country;\r\npolicemen escorted him to the stage-coach, from which he was forbidden\r\nto alight in Halle. He had received a festive welcome in Prussia, but\r\nhis leave-taking was of the coldest.\r\n\r\nThe arch-scoffer Heine, in his poem, _Der Ex-lebendige_, has the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n   \"Aranchuez! in deinem Sand'\r\n      Wie schnell die schönen Tage schwanden,\r\n    Als ich vor König Philip stand\r\n      Und seinen uckermarkschen Granden.\r\n\r\n    Er hat mir Beifall zugenickt,\r\n      Als ich gespielt den Marquis Posa,\r\n    In Versen hab' ich ihn entzückt\r\n      Doch ihm gefiel nicht meine Prosa.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[7] O my Aranchuez! how the days flew that I spent amidst thy sands!\r\nthose days when I stood in the presence of King Philip and his\r\nUckermark grandees. He nodded approval to me when I played Marquis\r\nPosa; my verses charmed him, but my prose he could not stand.\r\n\r\nAnd in _Die Audienz_ he jeers more mercilessly still at the Swabian\r\nsuckling:\r\n\r\n   \"'Ich will, wie einst mein Heiland that,\r\n      Am Anblick der Kinder mich laben.\r\n    Lass zu mir kommen die Kindlein, zumal\r\n      Das grosse Kind aus Schwaben.'\r\n\r\n    So sprach der König, der Kämmerer lief\r\n      Und kam zurück und brachte\r\n    Herein das grosse Schwabenkind\r\n      Das seinen Diener machte.\r\n\r\n    Der König sprach: 'Du bist wohl ein Schwab?\r\n      Das ist just keine Schande.'\r\n    'Gerathen! erwidert der Schwab, ich bin\r\n      Geboren im Schwabenlande.'\r\n      . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n    'Erbitte dir eine Gnade,' sprach\r\n      Der König. Da kniete nieder\r\n    Der Schwabe und rief: 'O geben Sie, Sire!\r\n      Dem Volke die Freiheit wieder.'\r\n\r\n    Der König stand erschüttert tief;\r\n      Es war eine schöne Scene.\r\n    Mit seinem Rockärmel wischte sich\r\n      Der Schwab' aus dem Auge die Thräne.\r\n\r\n    Der König sprach endlich: 'Ein schöner Traum!\r\n      Leb' wohl und werde gescheidter!\r\n    Und da du ein Somnambülericht bist,\r\n      So geb' ich dir zwei Begleiter.\r\n\r\n    Zwei sichre Gendarm', die sollen dich\r\n      Bis an die Grenze führen.\r\n    Leb' wohl, ich muss zur Parade geh'n,\r\n      Schon hör ich die Trommel rühren.'\"[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n[8]\r\n\r\n   \"I will, as my gracious Saviour did,\r\n      Find the sight of the children pleasant;\r\n    So suffer the children to come, and first\r\n      The big one, the Swabian peasant.\"\r\n\r\n    Thus spake the monarch; the chamberlain ran,\r\n      And return'd, introducing slowly\r\n    The stalwart child from Swabia's land,\r\n      Who made a reverence lowly.\r\n\r\n    Thus spake the king: \"A Swabian art thou?\r\n      There's no disgrace in that, surely?\"\r\n    \"Quite right! I was born in Swabia's land,\"\r\n      Replied the Swabian demurely.\r\n      . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n    \"One wish I will grant thee,\" the monarch said--\r\n      Then the Swabian in deep supplication\r\n    Knelt down and exclaimed: \"O sire, I pray grant\r\n      Their freedom once more to the nation!\"\r\n\r\n    The monarch in deep amazement stood,\r\n      The scene was really enthralling;\r\n    With his sleeve the Swabian wiped from his eye\r\n      The tear that was well-nigh falling.\r\n\r\n    At last said the king: \"In truth a fine dream!\r\n      Farewell, and pray learn discretion;\r\n    And as a somnambulist plainly thou art,\r\n      Of thy person I'll give the possession\r\n\r\n    To two trusty gendarmes, whose duty 'twill be\r\n      To see thee safe over the border--\r\n    Farewell! I must hasten to join the parade,\r\n      The drums are beating to order.\"\r\n                                          (BOWRING.)\r\n\r\nIt was not only humour that laughed, but envy and vindictiveness as\r\nwell. Men wreaked vengeance on their own former enthusiasm. The Herwegh\r\ncatastrophe was, moreover, attended by disastrous practical results.\r\nThe _Leipziger Allgemeine Zeitung_, the Opposition newspaper most\r\nwidely read in Prussia, was suppressed the day after it published the\r\nletter to the king. The _Rheinische Zeitung_, the principal Liberal\r\npaper published in Prussia, itself very soon received its death-blow.\r\nAnd in Saxony, at the request of Prussia, Arnold Ruge's _Deutsche\r\nJahrbücher_ (first known as the _Hallische Jahrbücher_), the leading\r\nperiodical expressing the opinions of the reflective youth of the day,\r\nwas also suppressed.\r\n\r\nOne lesson the young generation learned from what had happened. It\r\nwas no momentous matter that a young poet should have shown himself\r\nembarrassed and then unmanly in his relations with a king. But the\r\nmen of this day had imagined themselves to have taken a great step in\r\nadvance of the men of the Thirties; they believed that they possessed\r\nstrength of character, whereas their elders had only been gifted with\r\ntalent. Now it was borne in upon them, not only that poets are little\r\ncalculated to make good political leaders, but also that the whole\r\ngeneration must discipline itself severely if it were to stand any\r\nfirmer in the day of trial than its predecessors had done.\r\n\r\nSo now thinkers and politicians by profession (in almost too many\r\ninstances professors) took the lead. And the fact that the generation\r\nwhich now revolutionised the mind of Germany failed so miserably in\r\nthe close of the struggle of 1848, is to be ascribed, not to want of\r\nstrength of character, but to that idealism which is bred in the minds\r\nof men who have never ruled, to their belief in the irresistible powers\r\nof ideas and ideals to realise themselves, and to their contempt for\r\nthat external brute force, which in theory was of minor importance,\r\nbut which, vanquished in the first brush, calmly allowed itself to\r\nbe disdained, and awaited the moment when, with renewed vigour, it\r\nreturned to the attack.\r\n\r\nThere was considerable difference of opinion as to the advisability\r\nof the various measures taken by Frederick William's ministers, but\r\nfor the most part they were unfavourably criticised. Under every other\r\nquestion smouldered the question of the Prussian Constitution. The\r\nking's attempt to dispose of it by a rebuff had been unsuccessful, and\r\nthe means which he and his advisers employed to put down the movement\r\nwere extremely infelicitous. In the Silesian Landtag (Parliament) the\r\nchief magistrate and other representatives of the town of Breslau had\r\nproposed an address from the Silesian Estates on the subject of a\r\ngeneral assembly of the Estates of the whole kingdom--a Reichstag. The\r\nking replied by a special announcement of the procedure to be observed\r\non the occasion of his approaching visit to Silesia, intimating that no\r\narrangements need be made for his festive reception and entertainment\r\nin Breslau, as he would accept nothing from that town. This in May, in\r\nreference to a journey to be taken in October, and festivities of which\r\nthere had as yet been no offer! And the king entered Breslau in state\r\nand was fêted after all, though the festivities were not held specially\r\non his account, but on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of\r\nthe incorporation of Silesia with Prussia. He contented himself with\r\ndeploring the absence in the invitation sent him of \"expressions which\r\nwould have given him heart-felt pleasure,\" and with declining to stay\r\nlonger than a day or two on account of want of time.\r\n\r\nYet the king stood in need of the consent of the Estates of the realm\r\nto the carrying out of a project of the utmost importance for the\r\nwhole country. The time of railways had come, and two matters had\r\nto be arranged, a loan of the money needed for the construction of\r\nState railways, and a State guarantee to the constructors of private\r\nlines. According to a law passed by Hardenberg in 1820, the consent\r\nof the Estates of the realm was imperative in both cases. The king\r\nevolved an impossible plan; he proposed to convoke an assembly of six\r\nhundred representatives chosen from the different provincial Landtage,\r\nand to let this assembly play the part of Reichstände (Estates of\r\nthe realm). Metternich was obliged to interfere, and prove the utter\r\nimpracticability of the scheme.[9]\r\n\r\n[9] Sybel: _Die Begründung des deutschen Reiches_, i. 107.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that a small pamphlet, _Vier Fragen eines\r\nOstpreussen_ (\"Four Questions by an East-Prussian\"), made a sensation\r\nthroughout the whole of Germany. The little book appeared on the\r\nspiritual horizon like the first distant flash of lightning that\r\npreludes the storm. Purporting to be printed in Mannheim, it was\r\nscattered abroad everywhere in the end of February 1841. Such careful\r\narrangements had been made that it found its way into the booksellers'\r\nwindows of every town in Prussia on the same day--every town except\r\nBerlin, where it appeared a little later, a precaution taken to prevent\r\nconfiscation before the general distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Four Questions which it contained foreboded the downfall of\r\nabsolute monarchy. They were: What did the Estates ask? What right had\r\nthey to make such a request? What answer did they receive? What remains\r\nfor them to do?\r\n\r\nThe book's answer to the first question was that, as things now stood,\r\nthe people had almost no share in their own government, although the\r\ngeneral high level of education made it natural that they should wish\r\nit. And their desire for a representative constitution, for a national\r\nparliament, was made more ardent by the fact that they possessed no\r\nother means, such, for instance, as a free press, of expressing their\r\nopinions, and that they thoroughly distrusted the king's ministers\r\nbecause of their arbitrariness, servility, and pietistic tendencies.\r\nTo the question: What right had the Estates to make such a demand?\r\nthe author replied: The right of authority, an authority declared and\r\nrecognised on the 22nd of May 1815. To the third question: What answer\r\ndid they receive? the reply was: A recognition of their loyalty, a\r\nrejection of their proposal, and comforting promises of some vague\r\nfuture indemnification. The answer to the fourth question: What remains\r\nfor the Estates to do? only occupied a line and a half. It was: To\r\ndemand now as a demonstrable right what they had previously solicited\r\nas an act of grace.\r\n\r\nThe earnest, impressive tone of the pamphlet, its appeal to the\r\npeople's sense of justice and self-respect, aroused a keen desire to\r\nknow the name of the anonymous author. He himself had sent his book to\r\nthe king, with his name written on the title page: Dr. Johann Jacoby,\r\nphysician in Königsberg. The king at once ordered criminal proceedings\r\nto be instituted against him. It appeared that he was a man of means,\r\nand a very highly esteemed physician. In 1831, during the first and\r\nmost violent epidemic of cholera in Poland, he had gone there to study\r\nthe disease. At a later period he had had a protracted quarrel with a\r\nWarsaw doctor, a regular quack, who, when the cholera broke out again\r\nin 1837, advertised his discovery of an infallible remedy for \"this\r\ntrivial, easily curable disease.\" Jacoby wrote a short scientific\r\narticle in disparagement of this man. The quack wrote an answer full\r\nof insulting imputations, which he published in the Berlin newspapers.\r\nBy the help of influential friends he not only managed to secure the\r\nprohibition of the publication of Jacoby's retort, but also to defeat\r\nthe latter's successive appeals to the Berlin censor's superior, to the\r\nhighest council of censorship, to Rochow, the Secretary of State, and\r\nto the king himself. The publishers in Hamburg, Leipzig, Grimma, Basle,\r\nand Berne, one and all refused to print the documents throwing light on\r\nthis affair. Any other man would now have given up the attempt to get\r\nhis reply to an attack in a contemptible newspaper article published.\r\nNot so Jacoby. Month followed upon month. The manuscript travelled\r\nthousands of miles, and was published at last in Paris, under the title\r\nof _Contribution to a Future Historical Account of the Censorship of\r\nthe Press in Prussia_.\r\n\r\nSuch was Jacoby's character. Here at last was found what Young Germany\r\nso sorely needed, what even Youngest Germany with its Herwegh had not\r\nproduced, that first essential in public life--a man. At last the\r\nGermany of the Forties had found a strong political leader--not a\r\nstatesman in the proper sense of the word, for time showed that he was\r\nincapable of accommodating himself to circumstances, that he could not\r\nbe satisfied with aiming at the attainable; but a man of inflexible\r\nwill, of absolute integrity, who with indomitable courage pressed\r\nonwards to his goal.\r\n\r\nThe Government organs, the libellous press, began a systematic\r\nattack upon him. There was nothing to lay hold of in his blameless\r\npersonality, but he was of Jewish descent. In a little pamphlet\r\npublished by the local magnates of a small town in the neighbourhood\r\nof Königsberg under the title of _Stimme treuer Unterthanen seiner\r\nMajestät des Königs von Preussen_ (\"Voice of a Few Faithful Subjects\r\nof his Majesty the King of Prussia\"), we read: \"Not from German, not\r\nfrom Christian lips did these words proceed.... East-Prussia would be\r\ndisgraced if her sons had expressed such sentiments.... The seed of\r\nJacob did not hearken to the voice of God, did not acknowledge his only\r\nbegotten son, but put him to death; therefore they were cast off for\r\never, and scattered abroad among the nations of the earth.\" Presently,\r\nhowever, in all the booksellers' windows the portrait of Jacoby was to\r\nbe seen; his face, with its clear-cut features, was surrounded by four\r\nmarks of interrogation; he held his pen like a lance poised for attack.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the man who thus made his appearance was felt\r\nby the poets, even by those with least strength of character, even\r\nby Dingelstedt, who was then preparing to barter his oppositionist\r\nprinciples for the title of _Hofrath_ (Privy Councillor). In\r\nDingelstedt's fine collection of poems, _Nachtwächters Weltgang_, we\r\nfind one with the heading: ????, evidently addressed to the King of\r\nPrussia:\r\n\r\n  \"Du weisst, was das bedeuten will? Du wirst sie mir nicht streichen?\r\n   Es sind ja nur unschuldige--vier kleine Fragezeichen.\r\n   Die wurzeln tief, die ragen hoch; wie die gerühmten Eichen\r\n   Des freien deutschen Volkes stehn vier kleine Fragezeichen.\r\n   Du wolltest sie zwar nimmer sehn in deinen weiten Reichen,\r\n   Doch drängen sie sich immer auf, vier kleine Fragezeichen.\r\n       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n   Und einst, wenn du gestorben bist, als Stempel dann und Aichen\r\n   Stehn gross an deinem Monument--vier kleine Fragezeichen.\"[10]\r\n\r\n[10] You know the meaning of these marks? You would never dream\r\nof erasing them--four innocent little marks of interrogation? Yet\r\nthey strike deep root, they mount towards heaven, like the oak, the\r\nemblem of the great, free German nation. You have done your best to\r\nannihilate them throughout your wide realms, but they persistently\r\nappear again, these four little marks of interrogation.... In years to\r\ncome, when you are dead, there will stand as sign and symbol on your\r\nmonument--four little marks of interrogation.\r\n\r\nHerwegh, too, sang Jacoby's praises, as if he had a prevision that this\r\nwas a man who, placed face to face with the King of Prussia, would\r\nplay a more manly part than he himself had done. And the prevision was\r\ncorrect In November 1848, when the king replied to the deputation that\r\nwaited on him to demand a change of ministers: \"I will not listen to\r\nany communication on this subject,\" it was Jacoby who stepped forward\r\nand said: \"It is the great misfortune of kings, that they will not\r\nlisten to the truth.\" Herwegh's poem, which has a J. as headings,\r\nbegins:\r\n\r\n   \"Und wieder ob den Landen\r\n    Lag jüngst ein schwerer Bann:\r\n    Da ist ein Mann erstanden,\r\n    Ein ganzer, deutscher Mann.\r\n    Ein deutscher und ein freier,\r\n    Wer hätte das gedacht!\r\n    Dass selbst die deutsche Leier\r\n    Aus ihrem Schlaf erwacht.\"[11]\r\n\r\n[11] Our country in these latter days lay under a heavy ban; but,\r\nbehold! there arose to deliver her one who with truth could be called a\r\nman. A German, and a freeman--who could have dreamt it? who could have\r\nlooked for this awakening of the German lyre?\r\n\r\nThe proceedings against Jacoby were carried on with extraordinary\r\nvigour. In less than four weeks he was brought up for examination\r\ntwenty times; ninety-six witnesses gave evidence, shop-women, cooks,\r\nand school-children among the number. His real misdemeanour was\r\nmerely a transgression of the press-laws, namely circumvention of\r\ncensorship. But he was accused of instigation to disaffection--for\r\nwhich the punishment was two years' imprisonment and disfranchisement;\r\nof _lèse-majesté_--for which the punishment was four years' penal\r\nservitude; and of high treason--punishment, \"death, with application of\r\nthe most severe and deterrent pains and penalties.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in his native town, Königsberg, that Jacoby was brought to\r\ntrial; but the court there declared itself incompetent to deal with the\r\ncase, seeing that it was one of high treason, and passed it on to the\r\nKammergericht in Berlin. The Kammergericht, aware that the charge of\r\nhigh treason was untenable, also declared itself unqualified, and sent\r\nit back. The king was obliged to issue an order in council, requiring\r\nthe Königsberg court to proceed with the trial. It was altogether to\r\nJacoby's advantage to be tried by his fellow-citizens; but he disdained\r\nthe idea of an illegal acquittal, and obstinately demanded to be tried\r\nby the Kammergericht in Berlin, since he was accused of high treason.\r\nHis wish had to be complied with. He was condemned to two and a half\r\nyears' imprisonment with hard labour and disfranchisement. But three\r\nyears later the highest court of appeal pronounced a full and free\r\nacquittal.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime all over Germany money was collected to present him\r\nwith a civic wreath; subscriptions poured in; the names of eminent\r\nmen headed the lists. Once more the Government was obliged to take\r\naction; the subscription lists were seized, the subscribers summoned,\r\nand a stop put to the whole proceeding. While the police and the\r\ncensors were thus struggling to suppress the agitation for a free\r\nconstitution, there was issued, on the 11th of August 1842, the most\r\nabsurd regulation of which there is any record in the annals of an\r\nautocratically governed country--one of the country's own existing\r\nlaws was added to the list of prohibited writings; it was forbidden\r\nto reprint the law of the 22nd of May 1815 (that relating to the\r\ninstitution of Estates of the Realm), because of its tendency to excite\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\nIn September 1842, those Prussians who had hoped to see their country\r\nunder the new king shake itself free from its humiliating relations\r\nwith the Emperor Nicholas, learned that Frederick William IV., in\r\nPlaten's day the warm, if platonic, friend of Poland, the hater of\r\nRussian tactics, was preparing for a journey to Warsaw to meet the\r\nCzar. On the return journey the king stopped at Kalisch to inspect the\r\nmonument erected there in memory of the meeting between the sovereigns\r\nof Russia and Prussia in 1813. A Russian officer, General Berg (the\r\nfuture castigator of Poland), translated the inscriptions for him. One\r\nof them was: \"May the Almighty give His blessing to the alliance and\r\nfriendship between Russia and Prussia, that it may advance the peace\r\nand prosperity of both countries and inspire fear in their common\r\nenemies!\" On hearing this inscription read, the king hastened up the\r\nsteps of the monument and in the dust upon its side wrote with his\r\nfinger the word: Amen![12]\r\n\r\n[12] Prutz: _Zehn Jahre_, i. pp. 237, 367, 516, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEUTRAL LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Frederick William IV. was, and remained, the most\r\nintellectually gifted monarch of his day; his conversation gave\r\nevidence of both intelligence and imagination. It was a principle with\r\nhim that all his feelings ought to be kingly; his published letters to\r\nHumboldt, written in amusing court jargon, are bright and clever; his\r\nsayings show quickness of apprehension, easily awakened compassion,\r\nready wit.[1] Nor can it be said that he was out of touch with\r\nthe German intellectual life and literature of the day; he showed\r\nfavour to all the \"good\" writers, and disfavour to the \"bad\"; but it\r\nwas not long before all Oppositionist writers were included in the\r\nlatter class.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the reign, Humboldt's was the dominating literary\r\ninfluence at court. Alexander von Humboldt, now eighty, the most\r\nfamous scientist of the day, and a man of world-wide celebrity, kept\r\nthe king well posted up in all the latest intellectual and scientific\r\nmovements. His brother Wilhelm's liberal political theories had fallen\r\ninto complete disrepute; to his own he dared not give expression at\r\ncourt; holding both superstition and reaction in abhorrence, he was a\r\nsilent witness of much that was repugnant to him, though he now and\r\nagain spoke his mind.[2] Honoured by the king and his intimates\r\nas the ornament of the court and the pride of his country, he took\r\nadvantage of his position to further the cause of science and to say an\r\noccasional helpful word for this or that persecuted author. Published\r\nletters show that, before 1848, the king treated Humboldt with a\r\nsort of playful familiarity, though there was no real, deep sympathy\r\nbetween the two men. After 1848, when the Kreuzzeitung party became\r\nall-powerful, Humboldt gave expression to his annoyance at having\r\nlost his influence, in such remarks as, \"It is no longer possible to\r\namuse the king;\" or, \"the king persists in wasting fruitless affection\r\non persons whom he has taken into favour.\" Amiability was not his\r\ncharacteristic at court; he was often sarcastic, and became angry\r\nwhen Ranke's political opinions found more favour than his. He was\r\ndisliked by many, amongst others by the queen, who disapproved of his\r\nattachment to Louis Philippe and his family. He was in the habit of\r\nreading aloud all varieties of literature, but never his own writings;\r\nmost frequently he read the _Journal des Débats_, whilst the king sat\r\nplanning landscapes and architectural drawings.\r\n\r\nAnother of those who read aloud to the royal family was Tieck, whom the\r\nking had brought to Berlin from Dresden. Though Tieck was considerably\r\nyounger than Humboldt, court life was a burden to him because of his\r\nbodily infirmity. Shakespeare and Kleist were the authors he most\r\nfrequently read from. The king ordered Tieck's own old fairy play,\r\n_Puss in Boots_, to be performed in Berlin, it was like the appearance\r\nof some antiquated spectre. At the king's instigation Tieck put the\r\n_Antigone_ of Sophocles on the stage, and Mendelssohn composed music\r\nfor it. But Tieck was only one of literature's invalided soldiers. When\r\nthe court dined in the garden of Sans Souci, he was afraid of draughts,\r\neven on the warmest days.\r\n\r\nAnother once famous author of the Romantic period whom the king called\r\nto Berlin was La Motte Fouqué. Though not much over sixty, this writer\r\nhad completely outlived his reputation. His romances seemed to the\r\nyounger generation to belong to a pre-historic period. People were\r\ntired of tales of chivalry and the service of love (_Minnedienst_) told\r\nin a conventionally childish style; his unhistorical conception of past\r\ntimes and his sanctimoniousness aroused derision. Had it not been for\r\nthe king's support, he would have died in want and oblivion.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, chiefly on the recommendation of Varnhagen, the king invited\r\nto Berlin a great poet who did not belong to the Romantic school.\r\nThis was Friedrich Rückert (1788-1866). Rückert was only fifty-three,\r\nbut he did not belong to the period in which he lived; he was the\r\nexpression in the literature of the day of that German universality\r\nwhich is unaffected by circumstances, of the gift of appropriation,\r\nabsorption and imitation of the peculiarities of all other races. All\r\nhis life long he shook poems out of his sleeve with a truly astonishing\r\nskill. As a young man he was initiated by Joseph von Hammer into the\r\nliteratures of Arabia, Persia, and Turkey, and in 1826 he was appointed\r\nlecturer in Oriental languages at the University of Erlangen, but his\r\nduties as lecturer he constantly tried to evade.\r\n\r\nThere is something about him which reminds us of Goethe in the Divan\r\nperiod, and something which he owes to the Schlegels and their\r\nindefatigable study and translation. The essay on philology, _Ueber\r\ndas Wesen der Philologie_, which he wrote in 1811, shows the influence\r\nof Friedrich Schlegel's work on the wisdom of ancient India; for he\r\nstarts from the idea of a \"universal poetry,\" for which he considers\r\nthe German language the most sympathetic vehicle. And universal,\r\ncosmopolitan poetry is exactly what this great master of style has\r\ngiven us. He, as the German patriot, makes his début with _Geharnischte\r\nSonnette_ (\"Armoured Sonnets\"), polished and rather mannered verse.\r\nThis book is followed by volume after volume of love-poems to various\r\nyoung women (five to six hundred poems). In the last and largest of\r\nthese volumes, _Liebesfrühling_, inscribed to his fiancée, Louise\r\nWitthaus, feeling is predominant; everywhere else he is the didactic\r\npoet employing lyric forms, here he is the singer. But even here, set\r\nforms--as in the _Canzonets of the South_--stand in the way of the\r\nsimple, natural outburst of feeling, and already Rückert's inclination\r\nto display his mastery over language shows itself in a hitherto\r\nunexampled free invention of new words and ease in interlacing within\r\nthe limits of metre:\r\n\r\n   \"Welche Heldenfreudigkeit der Liebe,\r\n    Welche Stärke muthigen Entsagens,\r\n    Welche himmlisch erdentschwungene Triebe,\r\n    Welche Gottbegeistrung des Ertragens!\r\n    Welche Sich-Erhebung, Sich-Erwiedrung,\r\n    Sich-Entäussrung, völl'ge Hin-sich-gebung,\r\n    Seelenaustausch, Ineinanderlebung!\"\r\n\r\nThere is more of philological and technical than of purely poetical\r\ninterest in such verse as this. But Rückert _was_ the philologist\r\nas poet. His predominating gift is the gift of language in its two\r\ndevelopments--the capacity to learn languages and penetrate into\r\ntheir spirit, and the capacity, due to his profound penetration into\r\nthe mysteries of his own language, to reproduce in German the best\r\npoetry written in other languages. He delighted in creating linguistic\r\ndifficulties for himself to overcome. At one time we have him writing\r\nin the old German style that corresponded to his Albrecht Dürer curls,\r\nat another as a young officer of the time of Napoleon; now he is a\r\nBedouin telling us Hariri's tales with marvellous skill, and again a\r\nPersian weaving his rhyme in the form of Ghazels or recreating the epic\r\nof Rustum and Sohrab. He appears before us as a Turk in caftan and\r\nturban, as a Chinaman with slippers and pig-tail; but most frequently\r\nand with most pleasure he sits as a Brahmin on the banks of the sacred\r\nGanges, proclaiming in sonorous verse the thousand golden rules of\r\na happy philosophy of life. It is said of Théophile Gautier that he\r\nwas, intellectually speaking, equally at home in ancient Egypt, in\r\nthe Russia of to-day, in Constantinople, and in Seville. This is only\r\ntrue to the extent that he was well acquainted with the climatic\r\ncharacteristics and the monuments of many foreign lands. It may be\r\nsaid with much profounder truth of Rückert, who comprehended the human\r\nbeings through their literatures, understood their language and thought\r\nin their spirit. He never saw the foreign lands with his bodily eyes,\r\ntherefore he has neither Gautier's colour, nor his power of graphic\r\npresentation; he views them all calmly, reflectively, with the eye of\r\nthe mind, and gives us the mental pictures in an astonishing variety\r\nof metrical forms. Whoever desires to make acquaintance with excellent\r\nspecimens of his art should read _Hariri's Makamehs_ (more particularly\r\nthe division entitled _Jungfrau und Junge Frau_) or _Weisheit der\r\nBramanen_.\r\n\r\nThese works had gained Rückert a wide circle of readers and admirers\r\nin Berlin; but the town, with its restlessness, was antipathetic to\r\nhim. He was to lecture on Oriental languages at the university, and his\r\nfirst lectures were attended by a curious crowd; but this crowd soon\r\ndwindled down to an audience of two or three, and Rückert gave up going\r\nto the university. He sat in his room in the third flat of a house in\r\nthe Behrenstrasse and wrote poems in which he expressed his detestation\r\nof Berlin and its agitated, modern life. Even the Berlin of the royal\r\nromanticist was too modern for these celebrities of past days.\r\n\r\nAt a somewhat later date the king extended his patronage to Christian\r\nScherenberg, whose poems, more especially the battle-pieces _Waterloo_\r\nand _Abukir_, were much admired at court--the author himself had to\r\nread them aloud. Even as an octogenarian, Scherenberg retained his\r\nplace as a favourite in Berlin society. He was born in 1798. His\r\nlife had been a hard struggle. After the dissolution of his unhappy\r\nmarriage, he lived, from 1833 to 1840, in rooms in a small house at the\r\ncorner of the Bendlerstrasse, looking towards the Zoological Gardens,\r\nin such poverty that he could not afford to buy firewood, and had to\r\nsend his children to gather sticks in the Gardens. He wrote poems,\r\ntragedies, and comedies, for which he could never find a publisher;\r\nnevertheless he was so successful in his attempts to keep up the\r\nappearance of a gentleman, that his relations in Stettin believed he\r\nhad won fame under an assumed name, and begged him to \"remove his mask\"\r\nand let them into the secret. All that his pen brought him was what he\r\nreceived for composing begging letters and for copying; the rest of his\r\nliving he gained by acting as tutor to the families of the gardeners\r\nwho lived in the neighbourhood, giving lessons which, according to\r\nagreement, were paid for in potatoes. A pretty story is told by Fontane\r\nin his _Life of Scherenberg_. Great hopes had been entertained in the\r\nBendlerstrasse that a certain long-deferred payment would be made at\r\nEaster in the shape of a juicy roast of veal; but in place of this, the\r\npupil, in his innocent desire to give pleasure, appeared with a lark\r\nin a little green cage. On Easter morning, 1840, Scherenberg himself\r\ncarried the cage out to an open field, set the lark free, and wrote the\r\nsweet poem, one verse of which runs:\r\n\r\n   \"Du, Vöglein, singst, das ist das Deine,\r\n      Hub leise ich zur Lerche an,\r\n    Ich geb' dich frei, das ist das Meine,\r\n      Ein Jeder bete, wie er kann.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe poor, struggling poet let the lark go, but kept its little clay\r\nwater-dish as a remembrance, promoting it to be his ink-pot.\r\n\r\nAt last his poems caught the fancy of the public, and the king,\r\ndelighted with the originality and rugged energy of the battle-pieces,\r\ntook their author into favour. The only thing connected with the time\r\nwhen he read aloud at court that Scherenberg could be persuaded to talk\r\nabout, was the pleasure of the half-hour before the reading, spent in\r\nhis friend Count Bismarck-Bohlen's room, where men joked and smoked,\r\nand afterwards drenched themselves with Eau de Cologne, because the\r\nking disliked the smell of tobacco. Many years later there was another\r\npotentate in Berlin at whose court Scherenberg was an attendant. This\r\nwas Ferdinand Lassalle. At his house the poet met livelier companions,\r\nin whose society he not infrequently permitted himself to make fun\r\nof his royal and aristocratic patrons. It was in his nature to suit\r\nhimself to his company; his court friends knew his weakness and excused\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnother favourite at the Prussian court, as indeed at all the courts of\r\nEurope, was Prince Hermann Pückler-Muskau, who from time to time came\r\nto Berlin to visit the wife whom, though divorced from her, he still\r\nloved. He was a handsome man, aristocratic in appearance and manners,\r\naccomplished and versatile, a favourite with men because of his\r\nspirit and gaiety, irresistibly charming to women; the list of famous\r\nwomen who were devoted to him is a long one; it includes Sophie Gay,\r\nHenriette Sontag, Bettina, and Ida Hahn-Hahn. In much the same manner\r\nas the Prince de Ligne before him, Pückler-Muskau belonged, by right of\r\nhis intellectual qualities, to the international aristocracy of Europe.\r\nHis desire to shine did not lead him to over-estimate his powers, did\r\nnot even preclude real modesty. He was a brilliant vagabond, a master\r\nof the art of living, and a skilled professional in one department of\r\nart strictly so-called, namely, landscape gardening. He was the first\r\nin Germany to desert the stiff, French style of laying out a garden,\r\nand to reinstate nature in her rights. His garden at Muskau soon became\r\nthe model garden of Europe.\r\n\r\nThere were many strange episodes in his life. Nothing could be much\r\nstranger than the story of his marriage. He was in love at the same\r\ntime with two young girls, daughters of Count von Pappenheim, whose\r\nwife was a daughter of Chancellor Hardenberg. This lady, who was forty,\r\nnine years older than Pückler, herself conceived such a violent passion\r\nfor him that she infected him with it. She gave up everything to become\r\nhis, and he married her, but with the proviso that he was to be at\r\ncomplete liberty to dispose of his affections as he chose. The marriage\r\nturned out happily. But after they had lived together for ten years the\r\ncouple amicably arranged a divorce, in the hope that the prince might\r\nfind and marry a rich heiress, and thereby repair his fallen fortunes.\r\nWith this aim in view he first visits London, then travels about in\r\nGermany. He writes daily to his divorced wife, his Lucie, keeping her\r\nfaithfully informed of the progress he makes and of the difficulties\r\nhe encounters in his pursuit of an heiress. Unable to capture one, he\r\nreturns to Lucie, and they again live lovingly together for some years.\r\nAfter this he travels for six years, returning at the end of that\r\ntime with a beautiful little slave, named Machbuba, whom he instals\r\nat Muskau. With this arrangement the princess was not altogether\r\nsatisfied, though she had made it a rule never to plague him with\r\njealousy. At the age of seventy she still loved and worshipped him,\r\nand in his intercourse with her he was always personified kindness,\r\nfrankness, and cordiality.\r\n\r\nPrince Pückler had never had any serious thought of taking up the\r\nprofession of author, but in 1830 he determined to publish anonymously\r\nthe letters which he had written to Lucie during his travels in search\r\nof an heiress. They had a great success. There was a society tone about\r\nthem very uncommon in German literature, an attractive carelessness\r\nof construction, due to the fact that they were not written for\r\npublication, a pleasing mixture of wisdom and frivolity. As already\r\nmentioned, many ascribed their authorship to Heine. Their writer was\r\nmodern in the extreme, thoroughly _blasé_, an advanced Liberal, a\r\nfreethinker in the literal sense of the word.\r\n\r\nFor readers of to-day the four volumes of _Briefe eines Verstorbenen_\r\n(\"Letters of a Dead Man\") have much the same value as Madame de\r\nGirardin's attractive five volumes, _Lettres parisiennes du Vicomte de\r\nLaunay_. She is fresher and writes infinitely better than the prince.\r\nHe has cosmopolitan experiences of classes and of countries that she\r\nknows nothing about. As a specimen of his style, those interested\r\nshould read the unassuming account of his conversation with Goethe\r\nin Weimar, to be found in the third volume of the Letters. Pückler's\r\nenthusiastic reverence for Goethe has a genuine ring, and the same\r\nmay be said of Goethe's answer to Pückler's polite speeches. Goethe\r\nat once begins to talk about Muskau (referred to in letters as M.),\r\nand commends attempts like Pückler's to awaken the feeling for beauty,\r\ndwells on the fact that the welfare of all would be rapidly advanced if\r\nonly each in his own sphere, great or small, would work faithfully and\r\nlovingly--that is what Pückler is doing in Muskau, and he himself has\r\ndone no more.\r\n\r\nPückler's later volumes of travel, many in number, leave us quite cold.\r\nThey lack the spontaneity of the Letters, and are still more destitute\r\nof that which could alone replace it, namely, literary talent. But\r\nuntil about the year 1840 they stood as high in the favour of the\r\nreading public as his first books, and their author's popularity was\r\nunbounded; he was, like Franz Liszt, known and admired everywhere. As\r\nlate as 1854 Heine dedicates his _Lutetia_ to him in an enthusiastic\r\npreface, in which he calls him \"mein hochgefeierter und wahlverwandter\r\nZeitgenosse\" (that highly honoured contemporary, to whom I feel myself\r\nspiritually akin). And in Varnhagen's diary for July 7, 1839, we read:\r\n\"Prince Pückler's name acts like magic. It needs but to be mentioned,\r\nand the great world of all countries listens in suspense. His fame is\r\nstupendous, and the cleverer men are, the more they appreciate him.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1834 Varnhagen had said of him that he possessed one quality in\r\ncommon with Young Germany, and that the most important, namely,\r\nabsolute freedom of thought; at a later period he said that Pückler\r\nrepresented the upper house, Heine the lower house in modern German\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nPückler's attitude to the House of Hohenzollern was one of chivalrous\r\ndevotion. He never came to Berlin without waiting on the king. He\r\nappreciated Frederick William IV.'s culture and wit, but, being a\r\npronounced Voltairean, to whom every priest was a hypocrite and all\r\nvague piety an abomination, the romantic strain in the king's character\r\nrepelled him. Like Humboldt he often fled from the court and took\r\nrefuge with Varnhagen, the keen observer and critic, who sat forgotten\r\nin his corner, writing in his Journal (a diary kept in Sainte-Beuve's\r\nmanner) the history of the times. And in later years Pückler, too, was\r\na regular guest at Lassalle's small dinner-parties, where he often did\r\nmost of the talking; it is said that he was the only person privileged\r\nby Lassalle to do so.[4]\r\n\r\nTo the authors already named we have only to add the aged Arndt, who in\r\nhis day had been persecuted as a demagogue, and we have the complete\r\nlist of the romantic, conservative, neutral, or aristocratic writers\r\nwhom the most powerful king in Germany succeeded in attaching to his\r\nperson. We see the length and the strength of the attachment. The\r\nOpposition attacked every author who had the very slightest connection\r\nwith the court or with those in power. We have seen how Herwegh begins\r\nhis first book with a defiant attack on Prince Pückler. He jeered even\r\nat Arndt--called him a sunset glow, incapable of illuminating the young\r\nworld--and received a poetical reproof from Freiligrath for so doing.\r\n\r\nFreiligrath was the only one of the young poets whom the king at once\r\n(1841) placed under an obligation (Geibel was taken into favour a year\r\nor two later). General von Radowitz, who admired Freiligrath's poem\r\n\"Löwenritt,\" in spite of its unnaturalness, induced the king to look\r\nfavourably on its author and to grant him a pension of 300 thalers.\r\nHerwegh, not content with making merry at Freiligrath's expense in\r\nsuch lines as the following, where _Freiligrath_ is substituted for\r\n_Mühlenrad_ (mill-wheel):\r\n\r\n   \"Mir wird von alle dem so dumm,\r\n    Als ging mir ein Freiligrath im Kopf herum,\"[5]\r\n\r\nwrote in his _Duett der Pensionirten_:\r\n\r\n        \"_Geibel_: Bist du's?\r\n    _Freiligrath_:      Ja, willst du mich kennen?\r\n                   Ja, ich bin es in der That,\r\n                   Den Bediente Bruder nennen\r\n                   Bin der Sänger Freiligrath.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThis was more than Freiligrath could stand. He threw up his pension, a\r\nstep which was soon followed by his complete conversion. His volumes,\r\n_Ein Glaubensbekenntniss_ (\"A Confession of Faith\"), published in\r\n1844, and _Ça ira_, published in 1846, show a steadily increasing\r\npassion of devotion to the revolutionary cause. He became the most\r\nhonoured poet of the party. Immediately after the publication of _Ein\r\nGlaubensbekenntniss_ he was obliged to flee the country, going first\r\nto Brussels and then to London, where he earned his livelihood as a\r\nmerchant.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote shows how popular he already was: From Brussels\r\nhe had taken an excursion to Antwerp. There he and his friends went on\r\nboard a barque that was lying in the river, ready to sail for Canton.\r\nWhile the boatswain was showing them over the ship, the captain, with\r\nsome friends, came out of the cabin. Freiligrath's party made many\r\nexcuses, but the courteous sailor bade them welcome, and invited them\r\ninto the cabin. On one of the shelves of the little book-case stood\r\nFreiligrath's Poems. \"Are you not pleased that your poems are going\r\nout to Canton?\" asks one of his companions. \"Eh!\" says the captain.\r\n\"This is Freiligrath? The real Freiligrath?\" On his question being\r\nanswered in the affirmative, the captain rushes to the speaking-tube:\r\n\"Hoist the flags! Man the yards! and serve champagne on deck!\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe fermentation throughout Germany was rapidly becoming more violent.\r\nEver since 1842 the Hungarians under Kossuth had been defying\r\nMetternich; in Bavaria the prestige of royalty had suffered from\r\nKing Ludwig's amour with the ballet-dancer, Lola Montez; in German\r\nSwitzerland the Radical and Jesuit parties were engaged in stern\r\nconflict. In Prussia the authority of the State Church was being\r\nvigorously asserted; Roman Catholicism was favoured, but all other\r\ndissenters were harassed. It was not only the Free-Catholics, a sect\r\nfounded by Ronge, and the so-called Friends of Light, another free\r\nsect, founded by Wislicenus, that were regarded with disfavour; even\r\nPietists were objected to, as not orthodox enough to suit the State\r\nrequirements. One protest after another reached the king from those\r\nwhose liberty in matters of conscience was threatened. And purely\r\npolitical agitation was on the increase too. The leaders of the\r\nopposition parties in all the States of Germany decried with one voice\r\nthe old Federal constitution (_Bundesverfassung_). Louder and louder\r\nrose the cry in Prussia (the king having laid no great restrictions\r\non the liberty of the press) for the promised new constitution. From\r\nabroad too came revolutionary impulses. Since 1846 Pius IX. had been\r\ngiving himself out as a Liberal and an Italian patriot. Insurrections\r\nwere breaking out all over Italy; Metternich was unable to prevent\r\nthem, and they were destroying his prestige. German emigrants in\r\nSwitzerland and North America did their best to fan the flame in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nMeantime the King of Prussia occupied himself with the institution of\r\nthe new Order of the Swan and with architectural plans. He proposed the\r\nerection of a great Hermann monument on the Rhine, as a demonstration\r\nagainst constitutional France; and he set the builders to work again\r\non the Cathedral of Cologne, after a pause of 300 years. This latter\r\nundertaking was considered symbolical, not from the national but from\r\nthe ecclesiastical point of view. It gave Heine occasion for various\r\nprotests and erroneous prophecies in _Deutschland, ein Wintermärchen_,\r\nand also gave occasion to Strauss's clever pamphlet, _Der Romantiker\r\nauf dem Trone der Cäsaren_, in which he manages to describe Julian the\r\nApostate as the enthusiastic religious reactionary, in such a way that\r\nthe parallel with Frederick William IV. suggests itself without being\r\npointed out.\r\n\r\nThe new literature, to which the king was distinctly inimical, soon\r\nbegan to return his enmity with interest. He established Tieck,\r\nthe fretful, crippled old man, at Sans Souci as poet-laureate, and\r\nSchelling, the mystifier, in Berlin as _summus philosophus_. He\r\ncaused the _Antigone_ of Sophocles and the _Medea_ of Euripides to be\r\nperformed in the theatres of Berlin and Potsdam, in hopes of thereby\r\ncounteracting the spirit of unrest in German literature. But that\r\nliterature went its own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Examples of Frederick William's style of wit: When the king was at\r\nthe play, lackeys stood in attendance outside the door of the royal\r\nbox. One evening, when his Majesty, provoked by the tiresomeness of a\r\nnew play, left his box before the close of the performance, he found\r\none of the lackeys sitting on the floor of the passage, sound asleep,\r\nhis head leant against the wall of the box. Instead of being angry,\r\nthe king said: \"Der hat gehorcht\" (means both: He has listened, and:\r\nHe has obeyed). In 1848, in the palmy days of the Revolution, the king\r\nwas obliged to receive one deputation after another, sometimes of very\r\npretentious and presumptuous common people. He addressed the members\r\nof one such deputation, one after the other. What are you?--A silk and\r\nwoollen cloth warehouseman, your Majesty.--Most interesting occupation.\r\nAnd you?--A medical student.--Excellent preparation for taking part in\r\nthe government of the country! And so on, all the time with a most\r\npolite, if ironical, smile. (Told me by an eye-witness.)\r\n\r\n[2] The king was at one time deeply interested in the mysteries of\r\ntable-turning, but it was long before any of the palace tables could\r\nbe persuaded to perform, a fact which did not surprise Humboldt. At\r\nlast the king received him one morning with the exclamation: \"Aha!\r\nwhat do you say now? We sat round the table for a full half-hour last\r\nnight before it would move, but at last off it went, round and round,\r\nfaster and faster. How do you explain that?\" \"Why, your Majesty, in all\r\ndisputes it's the wiser of the two that gives in.\" (Related by Humboldt\r\nhimself.)\r\n\r\n[3]\r\n\r\n    O little bird, to sing 'tis thine,\r\n      gently to the lark began;\r\n    I set thee free, that deed is mine;\r\n      We all must pray as best we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] A. de Reumont: _Aus König Fr. Wilhelm IV. gesunden und kranken\r\nTagen.--Briefe Alex. v. Humboldt's an Varnhagen von Ense.--Varnhagen\r\nvon Ense's Tagebücher_.--Hillebrand: _Zeiten, Völker und Menschen II_.\r\n\r\n[5] All that is going on makes me as stupid as if a mill-wheel (a\r\nFreiligrath) were turning in my head.\r\n\r\n[6]\r\n\r\n\"_Geibel_: Is this you?\r\n_Freiligrath_: Yes! will you recognise me? Truly it is I; servants now\r\ncall me brother, yet I am the poet Freiligrath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] Schmidt-Weissenfels: _Freiligrath._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL POETRY, PHILOSOPHICAL REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Anastasius Grün's (Count Alexander von Auersperg's) volume,\r\n_Spaziergänge eines Wiener Poeten_ (\"Walks of a Viennese Poet\"),\r\nthere is a poem, the title and the refrain of which is: Why? When new\r\nprohibitory enactments are pasted on the notice-board at the town-hall,\r\na little man comes and reads them and quietly asks: Why? When the\r\npriests from their pulpits groan and howl at the sunlight, he asks:\r\nWhy? When men go out to fight sparrows with halberts and spears, and\r\nuse cannons to shoot larks, he asks: Why? And when they try, condemn,\r\nand execute himself, from his very grave is heard the question: Why?\r\n\r\nSomething of this kind happened in Germany as soon as the patriarchal\r\nfaith in monarchy was thoroughly shaken. When an act of violence, or\r\na stupid act, or a subterfuge on the part of the Government killed\r\na hope, out of the grave of that hope grew a Why. And every Why\r\ngave birth to others. The four questions of the East-Prussian were\r\ninadequate now; questions grew and multiplied like those invisible but\r\ndangerous animals which in an incredibly short time can undermine an\r\norganism. Why revere? Why trust? Why endure? And, first and foremost,\r\nwhy keep silence? When they are going to shake off the yoke, men begin\r\nby refusing to bear it silently. Suffering and wrath, desire and\r\nlonging, now found vent in words, in song.\r\n\r\nPolitical verse, of which there had been occasional specimens among\r\nthe work of Platen and Lenau, Uhland and Heine, now concentrates and\r\ncrystallises itself into a separate species of poetry, a separate\r\nform of art. Political song of every variety is heard throughout the\r\nland. It is a time of growth; men of talent come to the surface in\r\ncrowds--Hoffmann and Herwegh, Dingelstedt and Prutz, Freiligrath and\r\nMax Waldau, Karl Beck and Mofitz Hartmann--such a rich and fragant\r\nbloom as had never been seen in this domain before. Old Romanticists\r\nexpressed their contempt for prose (_i.e._ political) poetry, dogmatic\r\næsthetes declared these poets to be possessed of rhetoric and not of\r\nlyric talent; but all to no purpose; the very number of them, and the\r\nway in which they spontaneously fell into position as a group, showed\r\nthat they had the very best, the only unchallengeable reason for coming\r\ninto existence, namely, that they could not help it, that the spirit of\r\nthe times was making its voice heard through them; and soon they also\r\nproved that they possessed the one and only right to exist, for they\r\nwere able to hold their ground, they took their position as literary\r\nmen, and gained the popular ear.\r\n\r\nThey had had a single forerunner in the Thirties, the above-mentioned\r\nAustrian poet, Alexander Auersperg. His verse was imposing, somewhat\r\noverloaded with imagery, at times wanting in taste; nevertheless it had\r\nthe true ring, and his pathos was genuine. Joseph II. is Auersperg's\r\nhero, and it is from the \"enlightenment\" standpoint that he regards\r\nthat political liberty which he so eagerly desires. It is the power of\r\nthe priesthood that specially arouses his wrath; but he distinguishes\r\nbetween _Pfaffen_ and _Priester_, attacks the worthless and sings the\r\npraises of the high-minded among the clergy. Upon lines like:\r\n\r\n   \"Stoss in's Horn, Herold des Krieges: Zu den Waffen, zu den Waffen!\r\n    Kampf und Krieg der argen Horde heuchlerischer, dummer Pfaffen!\"[1]\r\n\r\nfollow others which extol the virtues of the really saintly priests.\r\nStill we feel that in his opinion more of the former than of the latter\r\nare to be found in his own day. He regards it as one of the signs of\r\nthe times that the fat, animal priest has been succeeded by the lean,\r\nintelligent, ambitious one:\r\n\r\n                 _Die Dicken und die Dünnen._\r\n\r\n  \"Fünfzig Jahre sind's, da riefen unsere Aeltern zu den Waffen,\r\n   Krieg und Kampf den dicken, kugelrunden, feisten Pfaffen!\r\n   Auch in Waffen stehn wir Enkel; jetzt doch muss die Lösung sein:\r\n   Krieg und Kampf den dünnen, magern, spindelhagern Pfäffelein!\"[2]\r\n\r\nIn spirited verse the courageous poet attacked now Metternich, now\r\nthe detective police, now the censorship. His poems display a frank,\r\nvigorous spirit of opposition, no hatred, no wild resentment; one\r\nfeels that they are animated by anticipation of a glorious future and\r\nenthusiasm for the great men of the past. But Auersperg's plastic power\r\nis slight; he too often loses himself in a maze of allegory. The best\r\nof the political poetry of the Forties is, both intellectually and\r\nartistically, much superior to his.\r\n\r\nAbout a year after his famous journey, from the effects of which he\r\nhad completely recovered, Georg Herwegh published a second volume of\r\n_Gedichte eines Lebendigen_ (\"Poems of a Living Man\"), in which some\r\nnew and valuable qualities are combined with those characterising the\r\nfirst. There is more confidence and more fire, and both enthusiasms\r\nand animosities are less vague. We have fewer illusions, and a clearer\r\nunderstanding of ends and means; no more appeals to a king to lead the\r\nonward march of his people, or to God to give freedom and happiness to\r\nall the nations of the earth. Frederick William IV. had extinguished\r\nHerwegh's faith in princes, and Ludwig Feuerbach his faith in God.\r\nBut we gain the impression that the dawning light in men's minds has\r\nbroadened into the light of day.\r\n\r\nIn the old dawn-songs, which Shakespeare has imitated in _Romeo and\r\nJuliet_, the young girl always tries to keep her lover with her by\r\ndeclaring that it is not sunlight but moonlight that he sees, not the\r\nlark but the nightingale that he hears. This idea is cleverly reversed\r\nin the poem _Morgenzuruf_ (\"Cry of the Morning\"):\r\n\r\n   \"Die Lerche war's, nicht die Nachtigall,\r\n    Die eben am Himmel geschlagen:\r\n    Schon schwingt er sich auf, der Sonnenball,\r\n    Vom Winde des Morgens getragen.\r\n    Der Tag, der Tag ist erwacht!\r\n    Die Nacht,\r\n    Die Nacht soll blutig verenden.\r\n    Heraus wer an's ewige Licht noch glaubt,\r\n    Ihr Schläfer, die Rosen der Liebe vom Haupt,\r\n    Und ein flammendes Schwert um die Lenden!\"[3]\r\n\r\n_Unglückliche Liebe_ (\"Unhappy Love\") is an epigram pointed against kings:\r\n\r\n   \"Nicht an den Königen liegt's--die Könige lieben die Freiheit,\r\n    Aber die Freiheit liebt leider die Könige nicht.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe tone of Herwegh's previous volume, even in its apparently\r\nirreligious utterances, had been theistic. On the adjuration to tear\r\nthe crosses from the graves and use them as swords, follows the line:\r\n\"God forgives the deed ye do.\" But in this new volume we find a poem in\r\nwhich Feuerbach's praises are sung because he has attacked the doctrine\r\nof immortality, and a Song of the Heathen, which is more daring in its\r\nmockery than any similar poem of Heine's:\r\n\r\n   \"Die Heiden--'s ist doch Schade um solch Ingenium.\r\n    Sie hiessen Vier gerade und nahmen Fünf für krumm.\r\n    Auch hatt' die Jungfernschaft ein End, sobald die Magd ein Kind gebar,\r\n    Dieweil das neue Testament noch nicht erfunden war.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, unlike Auersperg, who makes a distinction between the good and\r\nthe bad priest, Herwegh holds the whole brotherhood in derision,\r\nmocks at Catholic and Protestant, shorn and unshorn, in the witty,\r\nuntranslatable epigram:\r\n\r\n   \"Ob sie katholisch geschoren, ob protestantisch gescheitelt,\r\n    Gleichviel--immer geräth man den Gesellen in's Haar.\"\r\n\r\nHe had pricked before, now he stung; the singer of liberty had\r\ndeveloped into a herald and preparer of the approaching revolution.\r\n\r\nIf these powerful poems did not greatly move men's minds, it is to\r\nbe ascribed to the fact that the deficiencies of Herwegh's personal\r\ncharacter were subtly influencing his verse. They betray themselves\r\nin a certain straining after effect, in his evident satisfaction with\r\nhis own witty sallies, and in his intellectual barrenness in every\r\ndomain except that of polemics. This second volume of poems is not a\r\ncollection which suggests that its author has any store of ideas, of\r\nimagination, to draw upon. When we read it, we understand his life; and\r\nhis life helps us to understand this book, with which his career as a\r\npoet practically came to a close. All that he subsequently wrote, and\r\nhe lived for thirty-two years longer, is contained in one small volume,\r\npublished after his death. The poems of this last collection are full\r\nof wit and full of enthusiasm for liberty; they are written--hardly\r\nfour in the year--by a man who to the day of his death remained\r\nfaithful to his revolutionary youth.\r\n\r\nThough faithful enough to his past, Herwegh was no worker in the\r\nservice of liberty. The latter part of his life was spent in idleness.\r\nHis career as a poet and critic began in 1839[5] and culminated with\r\n_Gedichte eines Lebendigen_. He married a rich young Jewess, an\r\nenthusiastic admirer of his poetry. After the Revolution of February\r\nhe took up the position of a leader in Paris, and invaded Baden at the\r\nhead of a body of republican German and French workmen; on the 27th of\r\nApril they were defeated by Würtembergian troops; thanks to his wife's\r\ncourage, Herwegh escaped. Heine has given a bitingly sarcastic, but\r\nvery unfair description of this campaign in _Simplicissimus I._ The\r\nsimple, truthful account which Herwegh's wife has published since, of\r\nall the incidents of the revolt, and of the part which her husband\r\nplayed in it, proves that, even if he lacked the tactical skill which\r\nhe laid no claim to possessing, he was a brave man. Herwegh now became\r\na member of the emigrant colony in London, and lived the emigrants'\r\nperniciously idle life; they had literally nothing to do but concoct\r\nfutile plans for new revolutions and fall in love with one another's\r\nwives. He afterwards lived in Paris and Zürich, always the same\r\ninactive life, persistently dissatisfied with the progress of events\r\nin Germany. Like Kinkel and like Moritz Hartmann, Herwegh was unable\r\nto the day of his death (1875) to reconcile himself to the great\r\ndevelopment of power attained by Germany at the expense of liberty. He\r\nnever relinquished the ideals of his youth; retained a manly admiration\r\neven for Heine, who had held him up to derision.\r\n\r\nBeing such as he was, it was only natural that Herwegh should from the\r\nvery first be on the watch in the matter of his brother poets' fidelity\r\nto their flag and the genuineness of their liberalism. His attacks\r\non Geibel and Freiligrath have already been noticed. He next turned\r\nupon Anastasius Grün (Auersperg), who had gone to Vienna in hopes of\r\nobtaining the appointment and rank of Chamberlain; his wife, by birth a\r\nCountess Attems, was invested with the Order of the Star of the Cross,\r\nand he wished to be able to accompany her to court. In stirring words\r\nHerwegh entreated him to retrace his steps:\r\n\r\n   \"Darf man den Tempel um ein Weib entweih'n,\r\n    Mit einem Weib um goldne Götzen tanzen,\" &c[6]\r\n\r\nDingelstedt retorted, defending Count Auersperg in a pretty poem:\r\n\r\n   \"O, sie will es nie begreifen, ihre Prosa und Gemeinheit,\r\n    Das ein Geist wie Du, ein Name, bürgt für der Gesinnung Reinheit,\r\n    Nur das Schlechte glaubt sie willig,\" &c.[7]\r\n\r\nThe retort evaded the attack instead of repulsing it. No one seriously\r\nbelieved in a man like Auersperg having changed his convictions; the\r\nground of Herwegh's attack was that, holding such convictions, he had\r\nsolicited a court appointment. It was his own future position that\r\nDingelstedt defended; he was the next poet upon whom Herwegh turned,\r\nwith a satire that was all the fiercer because it was silent, or at\r\nleast only indirectly expressed.\r\n\r\nDingelstedt, like Herwegh, had been obliged to leave Germany to escape\r\nthe consequences of writing political poems. The two poets met in\r\nParis. There they one evening amused themselves by trying which could\r\nwrite the better verses on the subject of his own imaginary political\r\nconversion. Herwegh wrote the poem \"Wohlgeboren\" the burden of which\r\nis: What is the use of all this talk of liberty and fatherland, of all\r\nthis enthusiasm, all this meddling with politics? What good has it done\r\nme? No, no! for the future I will be a quiet, respectable citizen:\r\n\r\n   \"Du sollst, verdammte Freiheit, mir\r\n      Die Ruhe fürder nicht gefährden;\r\n    Lisette, noch ein Gläschen Bier!\r\n      Ich will ein guter Bürger werden.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThis last line forms the refrain of all the verses. To outbid his\r\nfriend, Dingelstedt wrote the poem \"Hochwohlgeboren,\" which begins:\r\n\r\n   \"Ein guter Bürger willst du werden?\r\n      Pfui Freund!--Ein guter, Bürger--Du?\r\n    Das also war dein Ziel auf Erden,\r\n      Dem stürmten deine Lieder zu?\r\n    O nimm's zurück, das ekle Wort,\r\n      Wer mag sich so gemein geberden!\r\n    Nein, nein, mich reisst es weiter fort:\r\n      Ich muss Geheimer Hofrath werden!\"[9]\r\n\r\nIn this poem, too, the last line of the first verse serves as refrain\r\nto all the others.\r\n\r\nTwo years later Dingelstedt was Privy Councillor, librarian, and reader\r\nat the court of the King of Würtemberg. Herwegh contented himself with\r\nreprinting the two poems side by side.\r\n\r\nFranz Dingelstedt (born in 1814) represents one of the most curious\r\ntypes of the day. He is a revolutionary who ought to have been born\r\nin the purple, a Prince Pückler in the guise of a poor schoolmaster,\r\na satirist who cannot dispense with appearances, a man of first-rate\r\nabilities with neither serious vices nor serious enthusiasm, but\r\nwith ready wit and frequent poetic inspiration; early _blasé_, he\r\nretains a certain practical activity of mind to the last. He was\r\nborn in the worst-governed country in Germany, Hesse-Cassel, under\r\nthe hated administration of Hassenpflug, became master at one of its\r\ngrammar-schools, aroused dissatisfaction by his emancipated opinions\r\nand conduct and the liberal tone of his poetry, was transferred and\r\nperpetually interfered with, and sent in his resignation in 1841, when\r\nhe was twenty-seven. Only one year after Herwegh he published his\r\nfirst collection of political poetry, _Lieder eines kosmopolitischen\r\nNachtwächters_ (\"Songs of a Cosmopolitan Night-Watchman\"). Good verse,\r\nclever poems, a good idea. The watchman in his uniform, armed with his\r\nspiked mace, his horn in his hand, goes his nightly round, and, pausing\r\noutside the houses, tells us what he sees and imagines within.\r\n\r\nHe is a genuine night-watchman--thoroughly weary of the old woman\r\nat home, who is so ugly and so wrinkled, yet with whom he manages\r\nto live peaceably, for she sleeps by night and he by day; a genuine\r\nnight-watchman, who sings the watchman's song about lights and fires;\r\nlooks up at the prisoners, the political prisoners, peering through the\r\niron bars and shaking them; shudders as he passes the cathedral with\r\nall its relics, where the wind is howling so loud in the organ pipes;\r\nand then laughs at himself for shuddering. It is twenty years since he\r\nwas inside the building, he is none of your seat-holding church-goers.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he is not a genuine night-watchman. He has feelings and\r\nopinions which are not those of a man in his station. In one house a\r\nball is going on; he listens to the music, and describes the dancing\r\nand the behaviour of the fashionable company. What a sensation it would\r\ncreate if he, lantern and mace in hand, snow on his cloak and cap, his\r\ncheeks burning and frost on his beard, were suddenly to appear among\r\nall these shadows! Outside another house stands the carriage of the\r\ngreat, the all-powerful, Minister of State. The coachman is wrapped\r\nin furs, but the poor uncovered horses are trembling with cold whilst\r\ntheir master is playing cards within--just as if they could not revenge\r\nthemselves when he comes:\r\n\r\n   \"Ich rathe dir, lass die Karten ruhn,\r\n      Und hüte dich fein, Ministerlein!\r\n    Du hast es mit vier Hengsten zu thun,\r\n      Bedenk', dass es keine Bürger sein.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThere are many pathetic passages. In one of the suburbs the watchman\r\npasses a house where a poor wretch lies in his last agonies; he passes\r\nthe lunatic asylum, and the dread of madness that always seizes him\r\nhere is mingled with a strange feeling of attraction; he passes the\r\ncemetery, where his poor father, who took his own life, lies in a\r\ndisdained, neglected corner; and on his way back he passes the palace,\r\nwhere the prince tosses sleeplessly on his pillow of down, while the\r\nsentry sleeps soundly standing in his box.\r\n\r\nA night-watchman might easily have had some of these feelings--he would\r\nnever have expressed them thus; the mask is perpetually falling off.\r\nThere are one or two most masterly and natural expressions of popular\r\nindignation, for example the tirade occasioned by the sight of light in\r\nthe sickroom of a cringing courtier whose extortions have impoverished\r\nhis country:\r\n\r\n  \"Warum er nicht schläft? warum er in Wuth die Spitzen am Hemde zerissen?\r\n   Ein gutes Gewissen schläft überall gut, und nirgends ein schlechtes\r\n       Gewissen.\r\n   Er hat an des Landes Mark, die Schlang', sich voll gefressen, gesogen,\r\n   Er hat--ein Menschenleben lang!--gestohlen, gelogen, betrogen.\"[11]\r\n\r\nBut there are also expressions of hatred and exasperation which we\r\nfeel belong to another class of society. We actually find the watchman\r\ngiving frivolous advice to a beautiful young lady who has been married\r\nto an old reprobate, telling her how she may best revenge herself\r\nupon him. At times his thoughts and reveries take a higher flight.\r\nHe is leaning on an old cannon, which stands on the rampart, shining\r\nand dumb. Once its wheels rolled over dead and living on the field of\r\nvictory; once it gave the signal for the dread onslaught, for beside\r\nthe touch-hole there is an N. surmounted by the imperial crown. Now\r\nits voice is only heard when some wretched prisoner has escaped from\r\nhis dungeon, or on the occasion of his Majesty's birthday, or when a\r\nprincess is born. \"Patience!\" cries the watchman to the cannon; \"it may\r\nbe that ere long thou wilt once more pour thy balls upon the enemy; but\r\nkeep silent in the meantime, old veteran, or they will spike thee as\r\nthey are gagging us.\" Here the mask is completely thrown off.\r\n\r\nAfter Dingelstedt had left Hesse-Cassel, he published _Nachtwächters\r\nWeltgang_ (\"The Night-Watch man's World Patrol\"), in which the poet\r\nis no longer the unsophisticated night-watchman--but the cultivated\r\nrevolutionary. He falls foul of bad kings, of the governments of\r\nHesse-Cassel, Prussia, and Hanover, and of false German patriotism:\r\n\"What, gentlemen, is a German patriot?--A man who serves the Lord\r\non Sunday and the king on week-days. What are the objects of his\r\ndesire?--Office, a title, and a ribbon for himself, bread for his\r\nlawful offspring, and legitimate sovereigns for his country.--Away with\r\nyou, German patriot! The temple is no place for you! You are a Judas,\r\nwhose treacherous kiss has been the death of liberty!\"\r\n\r\nA few months later Dingelstedt was a Privy Councillor and Councillor\r\nof Legation--held office, had a title, wore a ribbon. Naturally no one\r\nbelieved in any genuine conversion, and it is not surprising that his\r\nconduct was severely, and in some quarters spitefully, judged. The\r\nnumerous documents relating to his character and life which have been\r\npublished of late years (especially Julius Rodenberg's articles in the\r\n_Deutsche Rundschau_ of 1889-90) throw a more favourable light upon\r\nhis action than that in which his contemporaries saw it. There was a\r\nwant of fine feeling about it, it was unseemly, but it was not base.\r\nThere was nothing wrong in the actual fact of his accepting the post\r\nof reader to a cultivated and amiable sovereign, the fault lay in his\r\nhaving so shortly beforehand proclaimed all sorts of democratic and\r\nradical principles which he was not prepared to stand by.\r\n\r\nHe had the true artist's temperament, and yet was distinctly practical;\r\nhe was pleasure-loving and ambitious, unable to bear permanently the\r\nhumiliation of being poor and consequently ignored; he was above all\r\nelse impressed, strongly impressed, by the belief that in following\r\nthe path he had entered upon he was pursuing a _métier de dupe_. What\r\ndid he gain by refusing, because of his principles, to accept good\r\nappointments and influential positions! What did the world gain by\r\nclever men on principle leaving titles, money, office, orders, and\r\nposts of honour to the stupid men! Was this the best way to improve\r\nmatters? His great desire was to play the sovereign in some domain of\r\nart, to solve great scenic problems, to direct great theatres, to be\r\nthe favoured of beautiful women. Was he at all likely to attain it as\r\nthe exiled schoolmaster, the correspondent of the _Allgemeine Zeitung?_\r\nWho would permanently hold in esteem the poor, independent journalist?\r\nwho would not, in course of time, esteem the influential courtier? Of\r\ncourse there would be an outcry when he accepted the call--if only he\r\nhad not written that wretched poem to Herwegh!--but what was needed was\r\ncool courage, ironical impenetrability, smiling indifference, and the\r\ncalm superiority which allows one's opponents to bawl till they are\r\ntired; and these gifts he possessed.\r\n\r\nHe became, as every one knows, not only a courtier, but in course\r\nof time manager of one court theatre after another--Stuttgart,\r\nMunich, Weimar--ending his career as the influential director of the\r\nBurgtheater in Vienna.\r\n\r\nHeine, who was not strict, but witty, wrote the incomparable poem\r\n\"Verhofrätherei,\" which begins:\r\n\r\n   \"Verschlechtert sich nicht dein Herz und dein Stil,\r\n    So magst du treiben jedwedes Spiel,\r\n    Mein Freund, ich werde dich nie verkennen,\r\n    Und soll ich dich auch Herr Hofrath nennen,\"[12]\r\n\r\nIt expresses a mournful understanding of Dingelstedt's conduct,\r\nand bitter contempt for the public to whom both he and Dingelstedt\r\naddressed themselves.\r\n\r\nAny one who desires to get a distinct and correct idea of Dingelstedt's\r\nintellectual personality should compare the clever, graphic account of\r\nhis life, entitled _Münchener Bilderbuch_, with his own cyclus of poems\r\nentitled _Ein Roman_. These poems show us far more of his inmost nature\r\nthan the verses of his early youth. But he had early experienced the\r\nmingled feeling of attraction to the great world and contempt for it.\r\nIn the poem \"Krähwinkel,\" he wrote of fashionable society:\r\n\r\n   \"Sie lügen, sie krakehlen, sie hassen sich bis auf's Blut,\r\n    Zum Morden oder Stehlen fehlt ihnen nur der Muth.\r\n    Sie möchten gern und wagen's nicht, das heisst denn Recht und Pflicht;\r\n    Die denken können, sagen's nicht. Die Meisten denken nicht.\"[13]\r\n\r\nNow he tells the story of a society amour. In England, at a ball, the\r\npoet meets a lady of Hindoo blood, but English in every other respect.\r\nShe is spiritually akin to himself, gloomy and cold and weary of life.\r\nThey fall in love:\r\n\r\n   \"Wir klammerten uns, ob aus Zeitvertreib,\r\n    Ob aus Verzweiflung, an einander an,\r\n    Sie, ein verlornes, neugebornes Weib,\r\n    Ich, ein verlorner, neugeborner Mann.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThe word \"Zeitvertreib\" (pastime) is a little too weak, the word\r\n\"Verzweiflung\" (despair) is a shade too strong. There is German\r\npuerility in this insistence upon fashionable frivolity and blank\r\ndespair. So much is certain; the two fall in love. We have plenty of\r\npassion, hot and wild--more of sensuality in it than love, voluptuous\r\nnights, secret pleasures, and coldly cynical front shown to the\r\nworld; then separation, farewell, and oblivion; until one day in a\r\nconservatory in Amsterdam the decaying smell of a dead lotus-plant\r\nmakes him feel faint. He is reminded of her, and presses one of the\r\ndead leaves to his lips as if it were the hand of a corpse.\r\n\r\nSuch characters as Dingelstedt significantly illustrate their age, they\r\ndo not create it. They are not the builders of the palace, they are its\r\ngilders. No doubt the work of the gilder first attracts the eye, and\r\nattracts far more eyes than the work of the builder, who in laying the\r\nfoundation of the palace determines its whole construction; but there\r\nis also no doubt as to whose work is of the more importance.\r\n\r\nThese pleasure-loving poets, often disillusioned so young, with\r\nno principles except the political convictions of which they sing\r\nand boast, and to which they generally prove unfaithful, are of\r\nsocial importance from the fact that they create the opinion of the\r\nmoment, general political opinion, and thereby accelerate the slow\r\nreorganisation of society. But this outward reorganisation is not\r\nitself the principal matter; political opinion is not the prime mover.\r\nThe outward revolution is a result of movements going on much deeper\r\nbelow the surface. Perhaps the most powerful impulse is given by\r\nphilosophy with its quiet revolutionising of the religious view of life.\r\n\r\nIn this domain of philosophic agitation there appeared in the summer\r\nof 1841 (the year in which Dingelstedt's first book was published, the\r\nyear following the publication of Herwegh's first) an epoch-making\r\nthinker. In the work entitled _Das Wesen des Christenthums_ (\"The\r\nNature of Christianity\") he formulates great thoughts, founds and\r\nexpounds a philosophy of life which makes its influence felt in the\r\nspoken and written words of all who come after him, all at least\r\nwhose minds attain their fullest development. Ludwig Feuerbach is the\r\nfoundation-stone upon which for the next twenty years every one builds,\r\neverything is built.\r\n\r\nWhen I say of him that he was great, a great man and a great thinker,\r\nI myself resent the platitude. Great is a term which we hear so\r\nconstantly applied to this, that, and the other thing, that we\r\nhave come to be unaffected by it. There is not even any very keen\r\nappreciation among us of the quality of greatness. The sense for it\r\nis deadened by the cold, clammy manner in which the intellectually\r\ngreat are handled by those who write learned treatises on their\r\nwork. Take up a history of philosophy, and you will find them all\r\narranged and labelled, one looking exactly like the other. There\r\nthey stand in a row, all treated with the same respect, and regarded\r\nwith the same interest--Schelling, who was a genius and a charlatan;\r\nTrendelenburg, who accepted his appointment from Eichhorn and improved\r\nhis opportunities after the death of Altenstein; Strauss, who was a\r\nsecond-rate thinker, and a bit of a pedant; Karl Vogt, who was a gifted\r\ngourmand; Lotze, who was an excellent professor of philosophy, but\r\nnothing more; and amongst the rest Feuerbach, one of a list, possibly\r\nlabelled as inferior, onesided men, calling themselves ideal realists\r\nor something of the sort. The effect is demoralising.\r\n\r\nHe was great. This means that there is a wide, open space round him on\r\nevery side. It means that if we would understand him, we must separate\r\nhim clearly in our minds from all those men, all those facts that\r\njostle him in lesson-books and hand-books. That he was great means,\r\nthat he is altogether upon another level. The moment we catch sight of\r\nhim as he stands there alone, reverence takes possession of us.\r\n\r\nSimply natural as he was in intercourse with friends, there was yet\r\nsomething awe-inspiring about the man. Look at that face, in every\r\nfeature of which there is genius and character--obstinate, energetic\r\ncharacter. There is character in the mighty brow, in the small eyes,\r\nin the big, fan-shaped beard. There is power in it all, power and\r\nnobility, and manly beauty, stern as though cast in bronze.\r\n\r\nHimself a genius, he belongs to a notably talented family; the father\r\none of the most distinguished criminal jurists of Germany; brother,\r\nsister, nephew, all gifted. He is born at Landshut in 1804; studies at\r\nHeidelberg; turns his attention to theology, first from the orthodox,\r\nafterwards from the critical standpoint; then to philosophy, first\r\nabstract, afterwards realistic, ever more realistic. He publishes\r\nhis _Gedanken über Tod und Unsterblichkeit_ (\"Thoughts on Death and\r\nImmortality\") anonymously. The book is at first confiscated, but\r\nsubsequently allowed to circulate. After it becomes known that he\r\nis the author, he applies in vain for professional appointments at\r\nseveral of the South German universities, and similar attempts made\r\nsomewhat later in Berlin, France, Switzerland, and Greece prove equally\r\nfruitless, in spite of the support of noted savants. From 1836 onwards\r\nhe lives a retired life in the country--till 1860 at Brückberg, near\r\nAnsbach, afterwards at Rechenberg, near Nuremberg. In his later years\r\nit is the life of a hermit. He corresponds with friends of his own\r\nclass and stamp, and also with men of the people (such as Konrad\r\nDeubler of the Salzkammergut), who sometimes understand his writings\r\nbetter and feel them more deeply than the so-called cultivated class.\r\nIn 1837 he married the love of his youth. It was not without influence\r\non his life that, in the beginning of the Forties, a young girl,\r\ndaughter of one of his friends, was for a time passionately attached to\r\nhim, an attachment which he returned.\r\n\r\nHis only course of lectures was delivered in 1848, at Heidelberg, but\r\nnot at the university; there he was dreaded and shunned. In 1842 his\r\nfriends had tried to get him appointed professor at Heidelberg; he at\r\nfirst took kindly to their plan, but afterwards frantically opposed\r\nit. \"To try to make me a professor and that, too, in the ordinary\r\nway, the way in which any blockhead can be made one ... is to place\r\nme on a level with the fools that are posing as professors now, is\r\nto insult, to disgrace me.... The professor's desk is no place for a\r\nman with a head like mine. Do you know the proper place for my head?\r\nGuess! The block: for my brain is as keen and as peremptory as the\r\nexecutioner's sword, and I have no desire, no courage to do any deeds\r\nbut those for which men risk the loss of their heads.\"[15] His friend\r\nhad been advising him rather to call his work _Wesen der Théologie_\r\nthan _Wesen des Christenthums_. He answers: \"I take no interest\r\nwhatever in the overturning of theology. I concern myself only with\r\ngreat world-entities (welthistorische Wesen).... One must deal a mortal\r\nblow, must deny on principle. To act means to take life--with the\r\ndetermination, if necessary, to give one's own life in return.\"\r\n\r\nThis is more resolute language than the poets used; these views are\r\nvery different from theirs. Saint-René Taillandier animadverted on\r\nthe fact that Feuerbach, holding such views, did not take part in the\r\nrevolutionary movement of 1848. Feuerbach answered: \"M. Taillandier!\r\nWhen another revolution breaks out and I take part in it, know, to the\r\ndismay of your godly soul, that that revolution will be victorious;\r\nthe last day of the monarchy and the hierarchy will have come. Alas!\r\nI shall not live to take part in that revolution. But I am playing an\r\nactive part in another great and victorious one, the results of which\r\nwill not be evident till centuries have come and gone. For, according\r\nto my philosophy--which you know nothing about and presume to judge\r\nwithout having studied--according to my philosophy, which ignores gods,\r\nand, consequently, miracles wrought by means of political measures,\r\nspace and time are necessary conditions of all being, all thought,\r\nand all action. It was not, as has been asserted in the Bavarian\r\nReichsrathskammer, because the Parliament of Frankfort consisted of\r\nunbelievers that it was such a complete and shameful failure; as\r\na matter of fact the majority of its members were believers--and\r\nsurely God, too, respects a majority; it was a failure because it was\r\ndestitute of the sense of place and time.\"[16]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the number of different stages through which Feuerbach\r\npassed in his progress towards realism, notwithstanding all that can\r\nwith justice be said of the diversity of the positions he took up, his\r\nground-thought, the key-stone of the vaulting upon which the whole\r\nrests, is as simple as it is great. It is this: Man cannot be conscious\r\nof a being that is higher than himself. If it were possible for man\r\nto be conscious of himself--that is, his being or nature--as finite,\r\ncompared with another being apprehended as infinite, he would by this\r\nconsciousness limit his own being, _i.e._ deny it. His consciousness\r\nwould extend beyond the limits of his being, which is impossible, for\r\nconsciousness is simply the self-affirmation of being.\r\n\r\nInstead, therefore, of saying with Hegel: Man's consciousness of God is\r\nGod's self-consciousness, we are compelled to say: Man's consciousness\r\nof God is man's self-consciousness; religion is man's first and\r\nindirect self-knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is universally acknowledged that the idea, God, can only be\r\nformulated by the aid of human predicates--God is love, God is\r\ngoodness, knowledge, power, &c. The subject here is nothing but the\r\npersonified predicate. The predicate is the original. What religion\r\nreally means is this: Love is divine, _i.e._ of absolute worth,\r\ndeserving of adoration; goodness, knowledge, power are divine.\r\n\r\nHence belief in a God is belief in man as the essential being.\r\n\r\nThe apparent axiom of religion is: I am nothing, measured with God; its\r\nreal axiom is: Everything else is nothing measured with me; everything\r\nserves my purposes. By means of prayers and miracles, with God as\r\nintermediary, I have everything at my disposal. God is the creation\r\nof man's desire. The main desire of Christianity being unlimited\r\nhappiness, bliss, God is the means whereby bliss is attained, or, more\r\ncorrectly, bliss and God are one.\r\n\r\nIn a word; theology is anthropology, the theological problem is a\r\npsychological problem--which Feuerbach has solved in all essentials for\r\nall time.\r\n\r\nViewed thus, his life-work is seen in its unity. Though it is not\r\npossible to express the whole in a few words, yet it is easy to feel\r\nthat it is one single great thought, for which humanity is his debtor.\r\n\r\nWhen a young man stands in the Pantheon in Rome, lost in admiration of\r\nits dome, the most beautiful in the world, his most natural thought\r\nis: O, like the builder of this temple, to have, were it but once in\r\none's life, an idea, simple and great as that which produced this\r\ncupola--to conceive some single fundamental principle, some simple\r\nand yet composite formula, capable of expansion to a whole scheme, of\r\ndimensions as grand as this firmament in miniature! One such thought,\r\nsimple in its beginning, stupendous in its development, would give\r\ngreatness enough to any human life.\r\n\r\nFeuerbach's was one of these fundamental thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Sound the trumpet, herald of war! To arms! To arms! War to the\r\ndeath with the wicked horde of stupid, hypocritical priests!\r\n\r\n[2] Fifty years ago our parents declared war against the fat and flabby\r\npriest; we, their children and grandchildren, have, like them, taken\r\nup arms against the cloth; but our cry is: Death to the lean and lanky\r\npriestlings!\r\n\r\n[3] 'Tis the lark, not the nightingale, that sings so clear; the great\r\nsun-ball is rising fast, borne by the winds of the morning. It is day!\r\nit is day! The night will end in blood. Awake, all ye who believe in\r\nthe light eternal! Tear the rose-wreaths of love from your heads, and\r\ngird yourselves with swords of flame!\r\n\r\n[4]\r\n\r\n   'Tis not the fault of the Kings--_they_ are all lovers of freedom;\r\n    But their misfortune is this: Freedom has no love for them.\r\n\r\n[5] His youthful writings are collected in _Gedichte und kritische\r\nAufsätze_, 1845, 2 vols.\r\n\r\n[6] Would you desecrate the temple for the sake of a woman, dance with\r\nher before golden idols, &c.\r\n\r\n[7] Prosaic vulgar-mindedness cannot, will not, understand that thy\r\nname, a mind like thine, is a security for integrity of purpose; it is\r\nready to believe only what is bad, &c.\r\n\r\n[8] No longer, damned Liberty, shalt thou disturb my peace of mind.\r\nLisette! another glass of beer!

Those that think keep their thoughts to\r\nthemselves; most of them do not think.\r\n\r\n[14] We clung to each other-was it to pass the time, or was it in\r\ndespair? she a lost, new-born woman, I a lost, new-born man.\r\n\r\n[15] _Briefwechsel zwischen Feuerbach und Christian Kapp_, 1876, p, 176.\r\n\r\n[16] _Wesen der Religion_, p. vii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nREVOLUTIONARY POETRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe profoundest characteristic of that literature which in the Forties\r\nstill continued to be known by the name of _Bewegungslitteratur_, is\r\nits utter want of connection with official Germany. It is the absence\r\nof any such connection that gives it its strength and its freshness.\r\nOfficial Germany is not to be taken here in the narrow sense of\r\nGerman officialdom; it means all that part of the people--German or\r\nany other--which in normal circumstances appears to be the whole\r\npeople, and as such sets the stamp of nationality on all that is\r\nproduced by that people, the same stamp which it has set on all that\r\nhas emanated from it in the past. With what a later period has called\r\n_Bildungsphilisterei_ (cultured philistinism), the most eminent\r\nliterary men of the period in question have no connection whatever.\r\nThere is no corresponding group of personalities and writings in\r\nScandinavian literature. Even the Radical poetry of the Scandinavian\r\nstudents became official in the course of a very few years. The\r\nmost gifted of the German poets of the day are independent, or make\r\nthemselves independent, of official Germany, and bear like men the\r\nconsequences of the position they take up.\r\n\r\nAmong those who declare their independence, the most interesting figure\r\nis Freiligrath, born in Detmold in 1810. Fair, blue-eyed, massively\r\nbuilt, and shaggy-maned, he is the true son of Westphalia. His father,\r\na schoolmaster, educated him against his will as a merchant, and to his\r\ncommercial education and pursuits are to be ascribed his freedom from\r\nclassical reminiscences, his exclusively modern literary culture, his\r\nunderstanding of the foreign climes and countries with which commerce\r\nbrings us into communication, and his distinctly modern turn of thought.\r\n\r\nFreiligrath is not, like Hoffmann von Fallersleben, his predecessor\r\nin the field of political poetry, only a prolific song writer; he is\r\na genuine, inspired poet. Hoffmann, who had made a study of the old\r\nGerman songs and ballads, and was himself a man of simple, popular\r\ntastes, poured forth an inexhaustible stream of polemical verse,\r\ndirected against the squirearchy and bureaucracy, but he repeated\r\nhimself with the monotony of the popular poet. Freiligrath wrote\r\ncomparatively little, but every one of his poems has its distinct\r\nindividuality. He is influenced by that modern French and English\r\npoetry of which he has given us so many admirable translations, and\r\nmakes his debut as a descriptive poet of the Victor Hugo school, but\r\nsoon develops a distinct literary individuality. He possesses in a very\r\nhigh degree two qualities which are seldom found united, the faculty\r\nof picturesque description and intensity of feeling. The former leads\r\nhim to depict themes from foreign lands, full of glowing colour, the\r\nlatter displays itself when he sings of home and fatherland. In his\r\nrevolutionary period his warm feeling became powerful pathos, and his\r\ngift of graphic delineation was exclusively devoted to the service of\r\nhostility and ire.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, in Amsterdam (1831), the sea and the shipping made a\r\ndeep impression on him. In his dreams he followed all the vessels that\r\nglided out of the harbour bound for Africa, for India, for Turkey, for\r\nAmerica. He was seized by the desire to describe these foreign climes\r\nas they appeared in his imagination, and Hugo's _Les Orientales_ not\r\nonly suggested the colours to be employed in the treatment of such\r\nthemes, but also the metrical form. Freiligrath alone among German\r\npoets tried to master the alexandrines beloved of Frenchmen, despised\r\nin Germany, and to vindicate their beauty. Strangely enough, in\r\nspite of his usually correct ear, he so entirely misapprehended the\r\npeculiarity of this metre that he always writes it in pure iambics, a\r\npractice which Germans have continued.\r\n\r\nHe was possessed by the longing to roam--out into the wide world,\r\nacross the great ocean. Instead of German \"garret poetry,\" he wrote,\r\nin his garret, scenes laid in the deserts of Africa and the primeval\r\nforests of America. He attempted tropical local colouring, which was\r\nat times successful, at times unnatural; his linguistic specialty was\r\nnew and remarkable rhymes, produced with the assistance of resonant\r\nforeign words like \"Sykomore,\" \"Tricolore,\" &c. His good verses were\r\nlike living, his bad, in their lifeless splendour, like stuffed\r\nhumming-birds.\r\n\r\nBut this African Freiligrath is not the best Freiligrath. Freiligrath,\r\nthe Liberal patriot, is greatly his superior. After Herwegh's political\r\nchallenge had roused him, he took himself to task, tested with\r\nsimple-minded fairness those sympathies and tendencies of his nature\r\nas to which he himself was not yet absolutely clear, and discovered\r\nin the depths of his being an unquenchable desire for liberty and\r\na sympathy with the oppressed which on occasion could develop into\r\nburning indignation and hatred. His genius chose the revolutionary\r\npath, pursued it at full speed, and finally spread its wings and\r\nflew. _Marseillaise_ after _Marseillaise_ came from the poet's pen.\r\nO these hymns of 1848! they are enthusiasm itself, the enthusiasm that\r\nbegets enthusiasm. In the earlier ones we have fierceness, faith,\r\nrevolutionary piety, fiery sarcasm, the intoxicated jubilation of\r\nvictory; in the later, noble despair, sublime in its expression.\r\n\r\nBut the poems which anticipate the Revolution and incite to it are\r\nalso worth reading. Take, for instance, the volume entitled _Ça\r\nira_, published in 1846. In each of the poems of which it consists a\r\nsymbolical picture is graphically elaborated. In the first, a ship\r\nis setting sail; her name is Revolution, she is the black fire-ship\r\nthat sends her rockets aboard that hypocritical craft, the Church,\r\nand then points her guns at the silver fleet of Wealth. In another\r\nwe have a symbolical idea borrowed from Thomas Moore: the ice-palace\r\nof despotism, which will crack, and break up, and melt away as soon\r\nas spring comes. In _Wie man's macht_ (\"How the Thing is Done\") the\r\npoet describes the storming of the arsenal of a capital with such\r\ninfectious ardour, so dramatically and vividly, that we see it all,\r\nare ourselves in the thick of the fray. As the Revolution which he\r\nforesees draws nearer and nearer, his poetry becomes more and more up\r\nto date. He describes a Rhine steamer, which has the King and Queen\r\nof Prussia on board. The steamer is a picture of German society. The\r\ncompany on deck are enjoying the fresh air, the bright sunshine, the\r\nbeautiful scenery of the Rhine; but down below in the engine-room stand\r\nthe proletariat, in the shape of engineer and stoker, masters of the\r\nvolcano that drives the ship onwards. One push, one blow from them, and\r\nthe whole edifice of which the king is the crown, collapses; the deck\r\nis blown to fragments, the flames mount to the clouds--but not yet,\r\nthou angry element, not to-day! In such a poem as _Freie Presse_ the\r\ncourse of events is anticipated: the insurrection is on the point of\r\nbreaking out; one day more, and there will be fighting in the streets.\r\nAmmunition being short, the owner of the printing works orders his\r\nworkmen to melt down all the alphabets. And presently the hissing,\r\nglowing mass is flowing into the bullet moulds. The times are such that\r\nonly in the form of bullets can the types emancipate humanity.\r\n\r\nThe days of Young Germany were over, but now it seemed as if Germany\r\nherself had grown young.\r\n\r\nRobert Prutz (born in 1816 at Stettin) received that classical\r\neducation which had been denied to Freiligrath. A critical student\r\nof philosophy and history, he wrote upon many subjects, but it is\r\nonly as a political poet that he has any abiding significance. He was\r\none of the young men who ardently vented their opinions in Ruge's\r\n_Hallische Jahrbücher_, the result in his case being banishment. He\r\nis the Feuerbachian as poet. His political poetry, from the absolute\r\ndirectness with which it follows its aim, is apt to be somewhat dry and\r\nunimaginative, but his sober and yet warm love of liberty attracts us.\r\nIf you once learn to like him, it will be a thorough liking; you will\r\neven highly prize his latest collection of poems, _Aus der Heimath_, a\r\nbook which has been foolishly condemned as sensual; it cannot be denied\r\nthat he showed bad taste in dedicating it to his wife.\r\n\r\nIn his best work, a little Aristophanic masterpiece entitled _Die\r\npolitische Wochenstube_ (\"The Political Lying-in Room\"), Zürich,\r\n1843, Prutz, Holberg's warmest German admirer,[1] has succeeded in\r\nepitomising the wit, the irony, the endeavour, and the hopes of the\r\nyounger generation.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural that a poet with Prutz's classical training\r\nshould adopt the Aristophanic method, the pity was that he followed\r\nit too closely. His play became in consequence a jewel of price for\r\na select circle of readers instead of food for the multitude. It is\r\nthe production of a young, hopeful dreamer, whose faith in a glorious\r\nfuture for Germany was quite as lively and as strong as the pleasure he\r\nfelt in demolishing with his sarcasm what was decrepit and decayed; the\r\nburlesque figures and conceits stand out against an idealistic golden\r\nbackground because the poet sees the sun of the future rising and\r\nshining behind them.\r\n\r\nThe action passes partly in, partly outside of the house of a doctor\r\nwho keeps a kind of private lying-in hospital, where young ladies of\r\nthe upper classes at times take refuge. Of late his business has not\r\nthriven. It had flourished when Pietism flourished in Königsberg; much\r\npious embracing had gone on then, which, with God's blessing, had\r\nborne fruit; but now that the State Church has set itself to suppress\r\nPietism, his wards stand empty. He will soon be driven to apply for a\r\npost on the staff of the Prussian official newspaper; those who are\r\nfit for nothing else can always earn their bread in its service. The\r\nDoctor's servant, Kilian, who is famishing, asks for food. The Doctor\r\nadvises him to have his stomach removed, takes out his knife to do the\r\noperation, tells him that he will never feel hungry again, and that he\r\nwill confer an inestimable benefit on humanity if he can show himself\r\nas a living proof that the operation is possible. For what is the rock\r\non which virtue splits nowadays? Why did Freiligrath take a pension?\r\nWhy did Dingelstedt allow himself to be branded. The stomach, and\r\nnothing but the stomach is to blame for everything.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Herr Schlaukopf (Mr. Sly) has come on the scene,\r\ndisguised as a beggar. He declaims some patriotic sentiment, in the\r\nstyle of the Niebelungenlied, on the subject of Hermann the Cheruscan,\r\nand then asks for a contribution for the statue of that national hero.\r\nThe Doctor is incautious enough to call the statue a scarecrow, a\r\nhideous sentry brandishing a spit, on which Schlaukopf declares that he\r\nshall pay for these words by at least twelve years' imprisonment with\r\nhard labour. They fight, the Doctor pulls off Schlaukopfs false nose,\r\nand thereupon recognises in him the friend of his youth, the quondam\r\nsocialist, singer of liberty, republican, and regicide, now advanced to\r\nthe post of \"Wirklicher-geheimer-königlicher Leibspion\" (Real Private\r\nRoyal Body-spy). They fall into each other's arms, and Schlaukopf tells\r\nhis errand, but not till he has assured himself that the Doctor holds\r\nno awkward or seditious political beliefs. The Doctor, recognising the\r\nimportance of the man with whom he has to do, falls on his knees and\r\nswears that he believes nothing except that crown-pieces are round.\r\nThen Schlaukopf divulges the secret: \"Germany, our mother-country, the\r\nGermany of Frederick and of Luther, the fair-haired queen, is with\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor is at first incredulous. Is it not dropsy, the result\r\nof all the water-drinking introduced by these new total abstinence\r\nassociations? No, she is pregnant, and the only surprising thing about\r\nit is that the fact has not been announced in the newspapers, which\r\nusually inform the public when queens and princesses are in that\r\ncondition. And now Schlaukopf communicates the joyful intelligence that\r\nthe Doctor, as an experienced accoucheur, has been chosen to attend\r\nGermania; he, and no other, is to deliver her. The Doctor dances for\r\njoy, demands that he shall be rewarded with perquisites and an order,\r\nrequests Schlaukopf to bring the lady--but see, she comes!\r\n\r\nSlaves, who represent the enthralled people, bear her in in a golden\r\nchair. She is fair, with a fat, amiable face, a wide mouth, and eyes\r\nof watery blue. All salute and do homage to her as Germania. But from\r\na confidential conversation between her and Schlaukopf we learn that\r\nshe is not the person she gives herself out to be. He asks her if she\r\nis really pregnant; she replies that he ought to know best, he and the\r\nothers whom he has introduced to her. It seems that he has taken her\r\nfrom the street and trained her to play her part. She is the official\r\nGermania--and she has done everything that her artful masters have\r\nordered her to do, has bowed, and knelt, and pattered prayers at\r\ncommand. And now, at command, she is pregnant. Schlaukopf abuses her,\r\nand threatens to beat her; she taunts him and threatens in return to\r\nrun away and leave him to find another Germania where he best can.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in the darkness of night a stranger has appeared in the\r\nstreet in front of the house, a woman with a harassed, hunted look,\r\nwho declares that she knows not where to lay her outlawed head. \"I,\"\r\nshe says, \"the legitimate queen, must, like a common vagrant, hide my\r\nroyal head in the darkness of night, whilst she who has been exalted in\r\nmy stead and impudently allows herself to be called by my name, sleeps\r\nvoluptuously on silken pillows. Ye stones, be my pillow! For my people,\r\nlike their queen, have to lie on stone.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the night comes a cry, \"Germania!\" The woman in the house\r\nand the woman on the street answer at the same moment. Wrangling and\r\nconfusion ensue, the gendarmes arrive, and an attempt is made to\r\ndiscover which of the two has taken a name that does not belong to\r\nher. \"Not I!\" cries the stranger to Schlaukopf. She maintains that he\r\nhas stolen her name and decked his brazen-faced paramour with it, and\r\nconcludes: \"Shame on you both! I alone am the real, the true Germania!\"\r\nKilian finds it impossible to believe that any one so slender and\r\nemaciated can be Germania, but the serfs are thrilled to the heart by\r\nthe sweet sound of her voice. The diplomatic Schlaukopf alone keeps his\r\ncountenance:\r\n\r\n   \"Allein, so thut ein wenig nur die Augen auf,\r\n    Zu sehen braucht Ihr diese da und jene nur,\r\n    So ist's ja klärlicb, welche hier die Rechte sei:\r\n    In Lumpen jene, diese jedoch im seidnen Rock;\r\n    Die abgemagert, hungerbleich, ein Schattenbild,\r\n    Verbannt zu Bettlern, selber eine Bettlerin;\r\n    Höchst stattlich diese, wohlgenährt, anmuthiglich,\r\n    In hoher Herren ehrender Festgenossenschaft,\r\n    Ja selbst gesegneten Leibes ist, wie Ihr seht.\"[2]\r\n\r\nTo this comparison between her rival's magnificence and her own poverty\r\nthe stranger answers with dignity:\r\n\r\n   \"Wohl spotte mein! In meine Wunde lege du\r\n    Die blutbefleckten, diebsgewandten Finger mir!\r\n    Auf meine Lumpen speie du, und rühme dich\r\n    Weil ich ein armes, heimathlos vertriebnes Weib;\r\n    Du weisst am besten, wessen Hand mein Blut vergoss,\r\n    Und wer vom Haupt die Krone mir gerissen hat.\r\n        . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n    Ihr bautest du Paläste, mir Gefängnisse.\r\n    Ihr schmeichelten deine Schergen, mich verfolgten sie--\r\n    Dir aber sag ich, Schattenkönigin, o du,\r\n    Die du mit Zittern meines Namens dich erfrechst:\r\n    Hinweg! verbirg dich! Räume du den Platz, der mir\r\n    Allein gebührt! Denn eure Herrscherin bin ich.\"[3]\r\n\r\nAnd the serfs bend low in homage to the woman who comes, not in regal\r\npurple, but in rags like their own, saying to each other: \"May not this\r\nbe the long-looked-for redresser of our wrongs, she who is to break our\r\nyoke asunder and awaken the sleeping world with the lightning flash of\r\nliberty?\"\r\n\r\nBut now the two women are called upon to prove their respective claims.\r\nSchlaukopf exclaims: \"It is the legitimist principle we are called on\r\nto defend!\" and proceeds to prompt official Germania. That fat, fair\r\nlady, who boasts that she bears the future of Germany in her womb and\r\nclaims in consequence to be treated with consideration and reverence,\r\nrepeats a long rigmarole, supposed to be the story of her life: In the\r\ngray of eld she lay on bear-skins in the forest, drinking foaming mead\r\nand eating beech-nuts and acorns. \"Beech-nuts and acorns!\" cry the\r\nDoctor, Kilian, and Schlaukopf. \"It is she.\" Then she tells how she\r\nwas sent to school to the priests, had her nose flattened against the\r\ncrucifix, became _christlich-germanisch_, endowed monasteries, built\r\nchurches, kissed the Pope's toe, &c, &c., and once more the Doctor,\r\nKilian, and Schlaukopf cry: \"It is she!\" She tells what a peaceable,\r\ngovernable disposition she developed, how she allowed any one that\r\nliked to box her ears, how her loyalty has now reached such a pitch\r\nthat if her master but whistle, she comes, stands on her hind legs,\r\nfetches the stick--\"In a word, I am a well-trained poodle.\" And again\r\nwe hear the jubilant chorus: \"It is she!\" She concludes: \"God and the\r\nking willing, I shall be in the future what I have been in the past. By\r\ngovernment order I am now, as you see, with child. O gendarmes, take\r\nmy part! Recognise me as the one, true, Germania, as the thoroughbred\r\nGerman, and be assured that in return I will bring up my son as a\r\ngendarme!\"\r\n\r\nThe gendarmes are of opinion that she has made out a good case, and\r\nSchlaukopf is beginning to boast that the vagrant has been silenced,\r\nwhen she in turn lifts up her voice. She does not understand the art\r\nof self-praise, she says, nor has she much to praise herself for; the\r\nfuture will show what she is. \"I cannot deny,\" she continues, \"that she\r\nwho stands there is a Germania; she is official Germany, the Germany\r\nof the Government, of the Federal Diet; but the Germany of the German\r\npeople she is not; they do not know her, they do not care a straw for\r\nher rotten genealogical tree. If you would know which is the true\r\nGermania, ask these fettered serfs!\" At this moment the other Germania\r\nis seized with violent pains. She suddenly explodes with a loud report\r\nand disappears in a cloud of smoke, which, as it gradually disperses,\r\ntakes the shape of pilgrim monks, of romantic poets who sing the\r\npraises of the holy Middle Ages, of geese who lament that the Order\r\nof the Swan is not yet instituted, of moderate Liberals singing the\r\nchorus:\r\n\r\n   \"Immer langsam voran, immer langsam voran!\r\n    Dass der preussische Fortschritt nachkommen kann!\"[4]\r\n\r\nThen the serfs break their chains, cast themselves on the ground before\r\nthe poor stranger, and do homage to her as the true Germania, who is\r\nstill a virgin, but who one day will give birth to the ruler of the\r\nfuture....\r\n\r\nThe emblematical picture is a very fine, powerful one, and moreover\r\nit is true. The German Empire of to-day is not the offspring of the\r\noppressed, divided Germany that was then extolled as pregnant with\r\nfuture greatness; it is the outcome of the much-despised, the harshly\r\nsuppressed endeavours after liberty and unity. It is a mistake,\r\nhowever, to have represented the true Germania with no past, with all\r\nher power and glory in the future; though such a break of historical\r\ncontinuity did not in those days seem the impossibility that it does in\r\nours.\r\n\r\nOne of the truths proclaimed by this Radical polemical poem admits of\r\nno controversion, namely, that the official fatherland, the official\r\ncountry, everywhere lays claim to all that the genius of the people\r\nin times past has produced, to all their great men, even those whose\r\nlives were one constant rebellion against it. It banished, imprisoned,\r\nexecuted them--no matter; now it wears their portraits next its heart.\r\nAnd the official fatherland claims, and always has claimed, to bear the\r\nfuture in its womb. It not only maintains that the present existence\r\nof all and of everything is inseparably bound up with its existence,\r\nbut that it is pregnant with the new age and is consequently entitled\r\nto receive the respectful care that is the due of a pregnant queen.\r\nFor the thinking men of any people there is, besides this fatherland,\r\nanother, one that is not recognised, that is often disowned. It does\r\nnot deck itself with the national colours; for it the national song\r\nis not sung. It exists wherever people feel and act in the spirit\r\nthat has been the spirit of the best of the country's sons. It has\r\nthe allegiance of all the thinking youth. Those of low degree have\r\nmore part and lot in it than those in place and power. To it alone the\r\nfuture belongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The name of one of Holberg's best known comedies is _The Lying-in\r\nRoom_ (\"Barselstuen\").\r\n\r\n[2] To know which is the true Germania, you need but use your eyes.\r\nLook first at one and then the other. Is not the one in rags, the other\r\nclad in silk? the one starving and pale, a mere shadow, driven to house\r\nwith beggars, herself a beggar; the other stately, plump, and pleasant\r\nto the sight, consorting with right honourable gentlemen; with child\r\nmoreover, as you plainly see?\r\n\r\n[3] Yes, mock at me! Put your pilfering, blood-stained fingers into\r\nmy wounds! Spit on my rags, and proclaim me to be a poor, banished,\r\nhomeless woman. You know best whose hand shed my blood and tore the\r\ncrown from my head.... For her you built palaces, for me prisons. Your\r\nmenials flattered her, me they persecuted. And you, trembling phantom\r\nqueen, who have the effrontery to call yourself by my name, away! hide\r\nyourself! make room for the rightful sovereign! make room for me!\r\n\r\n[4]\r\n\r\n    Slowly onward, slowly onward in the race!\r\n    That Prussian progress may be able to keep pace!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nREVOLUTIONARY POETRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were real poets, aspiring spirits, who did not follow the general\r\ntrend of literature at this period. There were men like Eduard Mörike\r\n(born in 1804), the last scion of the Swabian School, who broke the\r\nbounds of its narrow tradition, and in his lyric verse may rather be\r\nregarded as an offshoot of the Goethe stem--a genuinely gifted poet,\r\nthe idyllic, arch, melancholy singer of the inner life, author of the\r\nimmortal poem, _Denk es, O Seele!_ And there were men like Otto Ludwig,\r\nthe Thuringian, and Friedrich Hebbel, the Ditmarschian, the two most\r\nrobust originals in modern German literature, who were both born in\r\n1813, and both developed their very dissimilar peculiarities after\r\n1848--two gnarled, leafy oaks standing without the forest's bounds.\r\nThe only mark of the period in which they were youths is the peculiar\r\ndefiant gloom which lies deep down in both natures. Specially their\r\nown is a kind of melancholy keen-sightedness, inclining towards bold\r\nrealism. They are the heralds of the realism of a later, unpolitical\r\nage. But they have not the characteristic common to all the political\r\npoets of their own age--sunny enthusiasm, a natural bias towards public\r\nlife, towards the radical reform, or, if necessary, the complete\r\nrevolution of society.\r\n\r\nThis bias, in combination with the philosophic lucidity due to the\r\ninfluence of Hegel and Feuerbach, is perhaps most remarkably observable\r\nin an author whose writings are, undeservedly, beginning to be\r\nsomewhat neglected nowadays, an author who, dying at the early age\r\nof thirty-one, did not live to see the Revolution of March. This is\r\nFriedrich von Sallet, a young German officer of extraordinary strength\r\nof character, whose solid, comprehensive culture was due to his own\r\nunaided efforts. In him the profound thought of his age is united with\r\nits extreme, passionate Liberalism. After his dismissal from the army\r\nin 1831, he devoted himself entirely to literature.\r\n\r\nHis best known work is his _Laien-Evangelium_, a kind of devotional\r\nbook for free-thinkers, a series of poems in which he gives a\r\nsymbolical modern interpretation to the various events of the Gospels.\r\nHe begins each poem with some story or lesson from the Bible, and then\r\nproceeds to show the living, eternal kernel in it, and to cast away the\r\nhistorical or mythical husks. The interpretations are at times rather\r\nfar-fetched, and the employment of but one metre throughout the whole\r\nbook undeniably tends to monotony. In its general conception the work\r\nreminds us of another, older book, Leopold Schefer's _Laien-Brevier_;\r\nbut the contrast is great between Schefer's comfortable satisfaction\r\nwith the divine government of the universe, and Sallet's impatient\r\ninclination to interfere with the natural course of events. We are also\r\nslightly reminded of Rückert's _Weisheit der Bramanen_; but Sallet's\r\nwisdom is a wrathful wisdom, no peaceful collection of golden rules of\r\nlife like Rückert's, but fiery denunciation of deceit and stupidity.\r\nIn his introductory poem Sallet compares those who had written\r\nOriental poetry before him to the Kings of the East, who offered gold,\r\nfrankincense, and myrrh to the Light of the world, and then fell back\r\nagain into their Oriental dream-life. Now, he says, light is once more\r\ndawning, thought is once more rousing from their slumber both East and\r\nWest. In his eager advocacy of his ideals, he is too indifferent to\r\ncolouring, too Western; his book is spoiled by its too modern, directly\r\ndidactic tone.\r\n\r\nThe collection of poems known as _Gedichte_ is a much finer one. Here\r\nagain the political poems are the most important.\r\n\r\nHe describes a sleeping giant, on whose head and breast foolish dwarfs\r\nare disporting themselves. They sit on chairs in his open mouth and\r\npay compliments to each other; spread their tables and dine upon his\r\nstomach; declare that it is his duty to sleep--if he does not, they\r\nwill punish him with pin-pricks. They believe that God has created the\r\ngreat giant solely that they may disport themselves merrily on the top\r\nof him, the truth being that if he were to awake and rise there would\r\nbe an end of them. The poet himself is tickling the giant's nose with\r\nhis paper in hopes that he will perhaps sneeze; that alone would play\r\nthe deuce with them. He cries: \"Awake and see how they are daring to\r\nbehave; it will be an easy matter for you to drive them away.\" And he\r\nconcludes: \"I know perfectly well what the giant's name is, but I have\r\nmy reasons for not divulging it.\"\r\n\r\nIn another poem, _Ecce Homo_, instead of appealing to the people\r\nas a people, he appeals to man as man: \"There stands the old, grey\r\ncathedral, and there the old, fortified royal castle, looking down on\r\nwandering humanity passing beneath them, one generation after another.\r\nSong is heard from the one, fealty is sworn in the other, from century\r\nto century; we seem, in comparison with them, but insects of a day. And\r\ntherefore fools preach veneration for these houses of cards. For what\r\nare they but card-castles, built for himself by man in his childhood!\r\nHe built them, and he can knock them down, and build others in their\r\nstead. Heaven and earth are but soft clay, which man can mould as he\r\ninclines.\"\r\n\r\nAt times Sallet writes in a lighter, more playful tone: \"What is the\r\nname of the old man to whom people everywhere, but these good Germans\r\nin particular, are devoted, though he has never done anything worth\r\ndoing? He stands in the pulpit, he drills the soldiers, he administers\r\njustice, he lectures at the universities, and his voice carries weight\r\nin the councils of the State. Taking a hundred steps to do what could\r\nbe done with one jump is called in his language 'the good old ways and\r\ncustoms'; this is what he approves of, but if you produce anything\r\noriginal and great, his wrath is aroused and he scolds and storms\r\ntill men begin to be afraid of you. He is wanting both in brains and\r\nbackbone, the old gentleman, and yet he rules almost absolutely, and to\r\noppose him successfully one would need to be as strong as a lion. There\r\nis no reason for concealing his name; it is Old Routine.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the _Gedichte_ are also clever parodies, such as the one in which\r\nthe poet attacks the censor, by whom he was perpetually worried:\r\n\r\n   \"Kennst Du das Land, wo Knut und Kantschu blühn,\r\n    Den Steiss von Zarenliebe machend glühn,\r\n    Wo man das Zeitungsblatt schwarz überstreicht,\r\n    Dass preussisch' Landtagsgift in's Volk nicht schleicht,\r\n    Kennst du es wohl? Dahin, dahin,\r\n    Möcht' ich mit dir, geliebter Censor, fliehn.\"\r\n\r\nHe is even more wroth with the cowardly prophet than with the censor:\r\n\"Ever so slight a blow with your hand,\" he says, \"and the mummy falls\r\nto pieces, once it has been brought up from the airless subterranean\r\nhalls to the light of day; it will stand intact so long as no hand is\r\nraised against it.\" He is furious with those who declare that things\r\nwill happen of themselves, that historical evolution, &c, will bring\r\nthem about. Nothing irritates him so much as to hear people say: \"A\r\nchange _must_ come; things _cannot_ go on as they are doing.\" \"Since\r\nthe beginning of the world,\" he says, \"nothing has ever happened of\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nHe could not, on account of the censorship, attack monarchy directly,\r\nbut he gives us, in excellent verse, the parable of the bear. Much in\r\nthe same manner as wolves are kept in the Capitol in Rome, the bear is\r\nkept in Berne as the emblem of the city. On this practice Sallet founds\r\nhis fable: \"The people of the Canton of Berne in days of old kept a\r\nbear. They let him live on the fat of the land, but they took good care\r\nto keep his claws cut in case he should take it into his head to tear\r\nthem to pieces. When asked to explain what good the bear did them, they\r\nanswered with surprise: 'Explain! Why, what should he do! He eats his\r\nfill, he moves about majestically, he growls--he is our bear, and that\r\nis enough.' If questioned as to why they kept him, they gave answer:\r\n'Because our fathers did. If the race were to die out, all would be\r\nover with us.' If any one ventured once again to ask why, they only\r\nshouted; 'Hold your tongue, or we'll beat out your brains.'\r\n\r\n\"One day loud cries were heard throughout the town; the citizens\r\nthronged together--the bear lay dead. He had died suddenly; they had\r\nno new bear ready to take his place, and everywhere the dolorous cry\r\nresounded: 'It is all over with the Canton of Berne! Up and away, brave\r\nhunters! Get us a new bear!\r\n\r\n\"In vain the hunters explore the mountains and the ravines; they cannot\r\nfind a bear. But in spite of this, wonderful to relate, corn and grapes\r\nripen, fruit grows on the trees--it seems as if nature were utterly\r\nindifferent to the woe of Berne. The sun, though it saw the bear lie\r\ndead, still rises every morning--the world still stands. What can be\r\nthe meaning of it?\"\r\n\r\nWitty as the fable is, it will hardly convince any supporter of\r\nmonarchy of the uselessness of that institution. Sallet only attacks\r\nthe foolish worship of the supposedly indispensable symbol, without\r\nmaking any attempt to dispute the most frequently employed argument\r\nin favour of monarchy, namely, the benefit which results from the\r\nwithdrawal of the highest of all positions from competition. He puts\r\nhis whole soul into another poem, _Aut--Aut_, a poem which became a sort\r\nof watchword for the youth of the day. Its most characteristic verses\r\nare:\r\n\r\n   \"Die ihr den grossen Kampf der Zeit\r\n    Ausfechten wollt, herbei ihr Ritter!\r\n    Sprecht, welcher Sach' ihr euch geweiht,\r\n    Sprecht frei durchs offne Helmgegitter!\r\n         Entweder--oder!\r\n\r\n    Für Fürstenmacht, für Volkesrecht?\r\n    Für Geisteslicht, für Pfaffendunkel?\r\n    Republikaner oder Knecht?\r\n    Ja oder nein! nur kein Gemunkel!\r\n         Entweder--oder!\"[1]\r\n\r\nAnd the poem concludes with an allusion to the time now fast\r\napproaching when the last on one side or the other with cloven skull\r\nwill bite the dust.\r\n\r\nSallet did not live to take part in the great, decisive encounter for\r\nwhich he so ardently longed. He died in 1843. Not long after his death\r\nthe storm-clouds begin to thicken and the birds to fly low. We are\r\napproaching 1848.\r\n\r\nLiterature follows in Sallet's path. From all parts of Germany comes\r\nthe cry: \"Let deeds follow upon words!\" We hear it not only from the\r\npoets of North Germany, the Rhineland, and Switzerland; three poets of\r\nfar-off Austria, Karl Beck, Alfred Meissner, Moritz Hartmann join in\r\nthe chorus.\r\n\r\nKarl Beck, the son of a Hungarian and a Hungarian Jewess, born at Baja\r\nin 1817, first studied medicine in Vienna, but gave that up, devoted\r\nhimself to literature under the auspices of Gustav Kühne, and produced\r\na succession of poetical works which attracted attention by their\r\nfaithful and vivid delineation of Hungarian scenery and Hungarian\r\nnational character. As regards this aspect of his work, Beck may be\r\nclassed with the Hungarian national poet, Petöfi, a man five years his\r\njunior; but as the poet of liberty, he must be regarded as a disciple\r\nof Börne--the only one who was of any importance as a poet. Like Börne\r\nhe is the champion of the Jewish race, of the proletariat, and of\r\npolitical liberty. In his writing we have the Old Testament style and\r\npathos combined with the influence of the newest French and German\r\noppositionist literature. In Austrian poetry Anastasius Grün and Lenau\r\nare his immediate predecessors. He had not the culture of a Prutz,\r\nbut his writing is distinguished by fervid colouring, emotional glow,\r\ngraphic power, and wrathful enthusiasm. He was, however, one of those\r\nwho, hailing the outbreak of the Revolution with joy, changed the\r\nkey-note of their song after the victory of the reaction. After the\r\nmagnificent revolt of Hungary had been crushed, he addressed a poem to\r\nthe Emperor of Austria in which he flatters the victor, and entreats\r\nhim to have mercy on the captive heroes. This poem enraged his old\r\ncompanions in arms. They called to mind that he who was now playing\r\nthe part of a loyal subject of the Emperor of Austria had, before the\r\ncollapse, been a republican and a socialist.[2]\r\n\r\nAlfred Meissner (born at Teplitz in 1822) and Moritz Hartmann (born at\r\nDuschnitz in 1821), Bohemia's two best lyric poets, are both inspired\r\nby the most ardent desire for political liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is unfair to allow the unpleasant ending to Meissner's literary\r\ncareer to blind us to his unquestionably genuine poetical talent. It\r\nis both pitiable and monstrous that one of Germany's best lyric poets\r\nshould, after an honourable youth, have descended so low as to buy the\r\nmanuscripts of an inferior novel-writer and publish them under his own\r\nname, but it does not detract from his worth as author of the fine\r\npoems which undoubtedly are his own. As specimens of a revolutionary\r\neloquence which was, and with reason, irresistible to the youth of the\r\nForties, read his glowing lines to the memory of Byron and George Sand.\r\n\r\nMoritz Hartmann, Meissner's countryman and contemporary, is a figure\r\ncast in different metal; there is no flaw in him; he is a hero as well\r\nas an unusually gifted poet. No other German poet has loved liberty so\r\nfaithfully and passionately from his earliest youth to the day of his\r\ndeath, or risked his life for it so daringly and so often.\r\n\r\nHartmann, who was one of the handsomest men it is possible to imagine,\r\nwas born of Jewish parents in the little town of Duschnitz. The family\r\nwas of Spanish origin, the name Hartmann being a translation of Duros.\r\nMoritz was sent to school in Prague, where, as a boy, he witnessed the\r\nbanished King Charles the Tenth's melancholy entrance into the town.\r\nAt the early age of thirteen he emancipated himself from the religious\r\nfaith of his family, and while still a mere child was deeply affected\r\nby the news of the discomfiture of the Polish revolutionists. As a\r\nstudent he became acquainted with Lenau, to whom he devoted himself\r\nwith the enthusiasm of a boy and a disciple. From his childhood he\r\nspoke both Czech and German, and his first book of poems, _Kelch und\r\nSchwert_ (\"Chalice and Sword\"), contains abundant indication of his\r\nlove for the Czech language, which he ranks with Polish, and extols\r\nas superior to Russian. But when it comes to the question of Czech\r\npolitical sympathy with Russia and hatred of everything German, he is\r\nentirely the German.\r\n\r\nIn _Kelch und Schwert_ (1845) the Bohemian predominates. The little\r\nintroductory poem tells us as much:\r\n\r\n   \"Der ich komm' aus dem Hussitenlande,\r\n    Glaube, dass ich Gottes Blut genossen,\r\n    Liebe fühl' ich in mein Herz gegossen,\r\n    Lieb' ist Gottes Blut--mein Herz sein _Kelch_.\r\n\r\n    Der ich komm' aus dem Hussitenlande,\r\n    Glaube an die fleischgewordnen Worte,\r\n    Dass Gedanken werden zur Kohorte\r\n    Und jedwedes Lied ein heilig _Schwert?_[3]\r\n\r\nA native of that country from which the emancipating doctrines of Huss\r\nhave been banished, he feels himself a Hussite, and interprets the old\r\nHussite war-cry, the right of the laity to receive the chalice in the\r\nsacrament of the Lord's Supper, in a modern spirit, almost the spirit\r\nof Feuerbach. In a poem on the German \"songs of liberty\" he tells the\r\nlyric poets of Germany that song is not the hammer that will shatter\r\na prince's heart; also that liberty is a woman, and not to be won by\r\nwords alone. He feels for the Poles as if he were himself a Pole.\r\nWe are made aware that he loves a Polish lady, and that through his\r\nlove to her he has become in his heart her countryman. The poem, _To\r\nC----a_, is one of the most beautiful that sympathy with Poland has\r\nproduced. Hartmann can at times be prolix and commonplace, but much\r\nmore frequently he is concise and dramatic. Some of his scenes impress\r\nthemselves indelibly on the reader's mind. Read, for instance, _Die\r\nDrei_, the poem of the three exiles who meet in a lonely inn on the\r\nplains of Hungary. They are sitting silent over their wine in the\r\nstillness of night, when some one suddenly raises his glass and cries:\r\n\"Our country!\" Of the three, one is a gipsy, one a Jew, and one a Pole.\r\nThey have no country; they look at their glasses and sit silent as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nEven more impassioned than his pity for Poland is his pity for Bohemia,\r\n\"the poor stag that is bleeding to death in the depths of a forest.\"\r\nNothing is left to the Bohemians but their music, that sweet music\r\nwhich awakes compassion for them everywhere, which sings and sobs and\r\nmelts men's hearts with its mysterious melodies.\r\n\r\nWe may say of this first book of poems what the poet himself has said\r\nof the following: \"Not a song in it but has been kissed on the brow by\r\nliberty, the most beautiful and noble of all muses.\" He already gives\r\nfrank expression to his hatred of Metternich's Austria, that Austria\r\nwhich in 1848, in his _Reimchronik des Pfaffen Mauritius_, he was to\r\ncall the Bastille of the nations, within whose walls the silence of\r\ndeath is only broken by the clank of fetters.\r\n\r\nThe sensation created by _Kelch und Schwert_ meant exile for Hartmann.\r\nHe had, in the first instance, transgressed the laws of Austria by\r\npublishing in a foreign town a work which had not been submitted to\r\nAustrian censorship. He knew that if he were to return from Leipzig,\r\nwhere he had been living for some time, in intercourse with Kühne and\r\nLaube, he was liable to be arrested on the frontier. But he could not\r\nresist the desire to see his mother again, and succeeded in making his\r\nway secretly to his native town. It was not possible to conceal his\r\npresence there; a traitor betrayed him, and he was obliged, before many\r\ndays had passed, to make his escape by a back-door while the police\r\nwere forcing their way into the house. In his _Zeitlosen_ there is a\r\nset of poems entitled _Heimkehr und Flucht_, in which he describes this\r\nyouthful escapade, and thus proudly delineates his own character:\r\n\r\n   \"Und als der Verrath mich ausgewittert\r\n    Und als die Häscher herangekommen,\r\n    Da hat die bleiche Mutter gezittert,\r\n    Der Schwester Aug' in Thänen geschwommen.\r\n    Ich aber sprach: Die Thränen verwischet,\r\n    Wir müssen scheiden und von einander,\r\n    Und da mich rings die Gefahr umzischet,\r\n    In Flammen werd' ich zum Salamander.\r\n\r\n    Ich bin geboren, ich, für Gefahren,\r\n    Sie lauern immer auf meinem Gange\r\n    Wie Wegelagrer in dunklen Schaaren;\r\n    Doch kenn' ich nimmer die Furcht, die bange.\r\n    Ich bin zu Gefahren bestimmt und geboren,\r\n    Sie lieben mich, wie Löwen den Meister.\r\n    Ich hab' sie alle heraufbeschworen,\r\n    Sie dienen mir, wie dem Zaubrer die Geister.\"[4]\r\n\r\nOn account of the prologue which he spoke at the Schiller Festival at\r\nLeipzig on the 11th of November 1847, a festival which was in reality\r\na demonstration in favour of the liberty of the press, Hartmann was\r\naccused of high treason and of offering affront to the Emperor of\r\nAustria. In 1848, as soon as the revolution broke out, he hastened\r\nto Prague. He and two friends, of whom Alfred Meissner was one, were\r\nsent as a deputation to Vienna. He has given an exquisitely humorous\r\naccount of their audience with Archduke Franz Karl, who received them\r\nbecause his brother, the Emperor, was ill, and who was perfectly\r\nunable to understand what they wanted.[5] When the rabble, during\r\nthe disturbances in Prague, attempted to storm the Jewish quarter\r\nand slaughter its inhabitants, it was Hartmann who rushed to the\r\nuniversity, persuaded a body of armed students to accompany him, and\r\nwith their assistance defended the quarter against the maddened crowd\r\nuntil the grenadiers arrived.[6]\r\n\r\nIn the Parliament of Frankfort Hartmann voted with the extreme Left;\r\nhis aim was the unity of Germany as a republic. He spoke seldom, but\r\nattracted much attention; he was known as the handsomest man in the\r\nParliament. Kinkel describes him at this time as a handsome, amiable\r\nman, with firm convictions; \"the Southern imagination of the Austrian\r\ngave him fluency of speech, his German training had given him solidity;\r\nwith Jewish cosmopolitanism he combined a steadfast patriotism which\r\nnot unfrequently found utterance in proud words.\" At first he took part\r\nenthusiastically in the proceedings of the Parliament. Afterwards,\r\nwhen these became both tedious and barren, and the assembly showed\r\nits incapability of laying any great and lasting new foundation, his\r\ndisappointment found vent in the witty, impressive _Reimchronik_, a\r\nwork written in the metre of Hans Sachs. Hartmann, however, was not\r\nonly a man of words, but a man of deeds. In the engagement in the\r\nstreets of Frankfort on the 18th of September, he exposed himself a\r\nhundred times to the bullets of both parties in his endeavours to\r\narrange a truce. After the revolution had broken out in Vienna, he\r\nand Froebel went there as deputies from Frankfort to the provisional\r\ngovernment to express the sympathies of the national assembly, and\r\nHartmann entered the army of the revolution as a common soldier. When\r\nVienna was defending itself desperately against the Croats, he one day,\r\nwith apparently certain death before him, joined a party that were\r\ndetermined to march through a severe fire to gain possession of a mill,\r\nand was made officer and leader when the original leader fell. After\r\nthe fall of Vienna he escaped, thanks to the protection of a lady of\r\nhigh position, who procured him a falsified passport. He returned to\r\nhis duties in the Parliament of Frankfort, and, when it broke up, went\r\nwith the protesting party to Stuttgart. There this last remnant of the\r\nParliament was dispersed by force of arms.\r\n\r\nAll Hartmann's work, including the youthful poetry written before\r\n1848, bears the mark of his resolute character. In the volume, _Neuere\r\nGedichte_, published in 1847, which as a whole is unpolitical, we\r\nfind in the division _Ost und West_ wild omens of the coming European\r\nstorm--for example, the irate poem to the King of Prussia, in which\r\nHartmann, deprecating Platen's and Herwegh's respectful attitude,\r\ncries shame upon him for delivering up the Poles to the Russian knout,\r\nand that other very touching poem, _Hüter, ist die Nacht bald hin?_\r\n(\"Watchman, is the Night nigh past?\"), which is one long sigh of\r\nimpatient desire for the dawning of the new era.\r\n\r\nAnd now that Bohemia and Hungary, Franconia and North Germany, were\r\nlifting up their voices in one great chorus--the voices of thinkers\r\nand of poets blending in unison--the youth of the country, as soon as\r\nthey awakened to intellectual life, were impelled to join that chorus;\r\nfrom the boy on the school-bench to the oldest student, their minds\r\nwere re-attuned, attuned to the key of revolution. Now they suddenly\r\nbegan not only to imbibe a revolutionary spirit from the works of the\r\nrevolutionary writers of the day, but to read one into the writings of\r\napproved neutral and conservative authors long since dead. At a given\r\nmoment it became their persuasion that all literature called to arms,\r\neven that old classic literature which was living its immortal life in\r\nhandsome bindings on the bookshelves. A certain frame of mind is the\r\nresult of our reading of all books.\r\n\r\nWhat had he been, that Schiller whose writings had been put into their\r\nhands when they were children? What but a revolutionary, the motto of\r\nwhose first book was the famous saying that what medicines cannot cure,\r\ncold steel cures, and what cold steel cannot cure, fire cures. Did\r\nthe spirit of his works in any single point harmonise with the royal\r\nPrussian or the Austrian imperial spirit? What had Goethe's youthful\r\nattitude been but one of Titanic defiance? Did not even the work of his\r\nold age, the second part of _Faust_, end with the wish that he could\r\nsee a free people on free soil? He had loathed the Berlin of Frederick\r\nII., would not his detestation of the Berlin of Frederick William IV.\r\nbe greater still? From the writings of Hegel, who had begun life as a\r\nrevolutionary and ended it as an ultra-conservative, they drew all the\r\nconclusions which he himself had left undrawn. Feuerbach had declared\r\nthat he would have nothing to do with politics, nevertheless they\r\ntransposed his philosophic decapitation of the historical state into\r\nthe region of practical politics.\r\n\r\nYes, the clouds were gathering. In place of the swallows, the heraldic\r\neagles of Prussia and Austria were flying low. The monarchs attempted\r\nin vain to exorcise the tempest. Frederick William IV. convened a\r\ngeneral Landtag (Parliament) in April 1847. With his convictions he\r\ncould not do otherwise than open it with a speech in which, in spite of\r\nall concessions, real and apparent, he made it clear that he was not\r\nprepared to take the decisive step which his people demanded of him.\r\n\r\n\"No power on earth,\" he cried, \"will make me consent to the exchange of\r\nthe natural relation between a king and his people for a conventional,\r\nconstitutional relation; never with my will shall a written paper\r\ninterfere between Almighty God and this country, rule us with its\r\nparagraphs, and supercede ancient, sacred loyalty.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe time had come. The assembly demanded annual Parliaments and\r\ncomplete fulfilment of the promises made in 1815 and 1829. Jacoby,\r\nHeinrich Simon, Gervinus, and others criticised the king's proposals\r\nand rejected them.\r\n\r\nThen the storm broke--first in Switzerland, where in November 1847\r\nthe Liberal cantons armed and suppressed the Jesuitical _Sonderbund_\r\n(league of the Catholic cantons), then with overpowering force in\r\nParis, then in all the German and many of the other European capitals.\r\nAs thunder in a mountainous country echoes from hill to hill, so the\r\nthunder of the revolution echoed from one European country to another\r\nin the mad and holy year, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Ye knights who have made ready to take part in the great battle\r\nof the day, lift your visors and speak clearly: On which side are you\r\nfighting? Either--or!\r\n\r\nIs it for the power of the sovereign or the rights of the people?\r\nFor spiritual light or priestly superstition? Are you republicans or\r\nthralls? No evasion! Answer plainly! Either--or!\r\n\r\n[2] _Cf_. Moritz Hartmann: _Reimchronik des Pfaffen Mauritius_. Chap.\r\nv. \"Apostel und Apostaten.\"\r\n\r\n[3] I, who am of the land of the Hussites, believe that I have drunk\r\nthe blood of God; love has been poured into my heart; love is God's\r\nblood, my heart his _chalice_.\r\n\r\nI, who am of the land of the Hussites, believe in the word made flesh,\r\nbelieve that thoughts become armed cohorts, that every song is a holy\r\n_sword_.\r\n\r\n[4] The traitorous friend had tracked me down, the minions of the law\r\nhad come; my mother turned pale and trembled, my sister's eyes were\r\nbathed in tears.

A long shudder, of pain and at the same time of relief,\r\npassed through the whole of Germany. It was as if a window had been\r\nopened, and air had reached the lungs of Europe. Example, the one power\r\nthat can do miracles, was forcing the German people to action. They\r\nwere also impelled by the fear that absolutism would now venture its\r\nlast move, would declare Germany to be endangered by the revolution in\r\nFrance, and compel the people of Prussia and Austria to take up arms\r\nagainst the French republic.\r\n\r\nIn Austria intolerance had gone as far as it could go. In 1846\r\nMetternich's government had actually placed the _Herzensergüsse_ of\r\nthe Emperor Joseph II., collected and published by a banished patriot,\r\non the list of contraband books. And now the disturbances in the\r\nAustro-Italian provinces, which were endangering the credit of the\r\nstate and the industries of the country, brought dissatisfaction with\r\nMetternichs rule to a climax. The decisive defeat he had met with in\r\nSwitzerland, namely, the collapse of that Jesuitical \"Sonderbund\" which\r\nwith all his might he had supported against the Radicals, had given the\r\nlast blow to men's faith in his invincibility. In one of the provinces\r\nof Prussia, Silesia, bureaucratic misgovernment had just produced\r\nterrible consequences. Typhus, the result of starvation, had raged for\r\nmonths among the miserably poor industrial population before those in\r\npower had made any attempt to remedy the state of matters. Hundreds\r\nof dead and dying lay by the roadsides. In the cold of January, poor,\r\nsolitary wretches starved in their hovels, and naked children pined to\r\ndeath beside the corpses of their parents; no one came to their aid,\r\nfor the ignorant local authorities had, in order to prevent the spread\r\nof infection, made it a punishable offence to enter any infected house.\r\nAll this time the government officials only appeared to collect the\r\ntaxes, which they did with harsh regardlessness of circumstances; and\r\nwhen the Governor was attacked because no remedial measures had been\r\ntaken from August 1847 to the end of January 1848, he answered that no\r\nformal appeal for assistance had been made.\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances the political leaders of the middle classes found\r\nit an easy matter to rouse their own class to action, and the working\r\nclasses, hoping to improve their position, and exasperated by arbitrary\r\npolice regulations, everywhere followed in the footsteps of the middle\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for the present generation to enter into the feelings\r\nof the men of 1848. The frame of mind which prevailed in Denmark\r\nat that time cannot be regarded as typical. There, as elsewhere,\r\nit undoubtedly was the instinct of national self-preservation and\r\npride that asserted itself. But whereas the other countries rose in\r\nrevolt against hereditary rule and coercion, in Denmark a revolt was\r\nsuppressed by the power of the hereditary monarchy and of insulted\r\nnational feeling. There was no thought of revolution in the minds of\r\nthe Danes; it was for old rights they fought, not for new ideas.\r\n\r\nEverywhere else in Europe the oppressed peoples revolted. It was\r\nlong since anything but evil had fallen to their lot, since they\r\nhad witnessed the triumph of anything but wrong, use-and-wont, and\r\nfalsehood. Actual and detestable had with them come to be almost\r\nsynonymous terms. But they had a faith that could remove mountains\r\nand a hope that could shake the earth. Liberty, Parliament, national\r\nunity, liberty of the press, republic, were to them magic words, at the\r\nvery sound of which their hearts leaped like the heart of a youth who\r\nsuddenly sees his beloved.\r\n\r\nThe aspiring spirits of the generation of to-day do not feel thus.\r\nThey know that stupidity is a ferocious animal, and the hardest of all\r\nto kill--that cowardice, the agile slave that stands at the beck of\r\npower, is as strong as courage itself when there is any question of\r\ndefending ancient privilege--that what is known by the name of progress\r\nis a feeble snail. The simpleton in the fable bought a raven that he\r\nmight see for himself if it was true that ravens live for two hundred\r\nyears. The friends of progress in our days know beforehand that all the\r\nraven-black lies and raven-trickeries of all the privilege-rookeries,\r\ngreat and small, will outlive them--for how many hundred years they\r\ncannot tell. At a rare time they have seen good victorious, but never\r\nhave they heard it acknowledged that it is _their_ good which has\r\ntriumphed. They have always seen truth first abused, then if possible\r\nkilled--if that proved impossible, maimed and recognised. Therefore\r\nthey have little hope. Many of them, indeed, have killed hope in their\r\nown breasts, as we kill a nerve that gives us too much pain. They have\r\nbeen disappointed too often.\r\n\r\nThe men of 1848 had never relinquished their hope in the future. They\r\nhad been oppressed, and they had suffered so long that they had grown\r\naccustomed to see brute force and hypocrisy triumphant, accustomed\r\nto live in a sort of spiritual twilight. But they believed in the\r\ncoming day. And now, suddenly, they saw it. First a gleam, then a ray,\r\nthen a flame, then the whole horizon, as far as the eye could reach,\r\na sea of light. For the first time they heard loud, ringing voices\r\nproclaim liberty to be the right of the people, without a voice raised\r\nin opposition; and for the first time, with wondering eyes, they saw\r\npower, that hitherto immovable mass, the giant bearer of oppression and\r\nfalsehood, begin to stir like some gigantic elephant, writhe and turn\r\nand shake itself, throw off its riders, and move ponderously in the\r\ndirection of the high-spirited, ardent friends of liberty, the men of\r\nthe new day, who stood ready to fling themselves on its back and force\r\nit to trample down all the ancient abuses.\r\n\r\nFor the younger men especially it was a moment without compare, a sight\r\nthat intoxicated them, that drove them wild. They shouted, they sang,\r\nthey rejoiced, and in their wild exultation they felt it a necessity to\r\nact, to risk all, to give their lives if need be--anything, everything,\r\nexcept be behindhand in greeting and ushering in the dawning day of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nTrue it is that democratic illusions held high revelry; true it is\r\nthat there prevailed a touchingly naïve belief in the infallibility\r\nof popular instincts; and true it is that the ability of theorists to\r\nsettle practical difficulties was greatly overestimated. But the first\r\nimpulse was irresistible, the original instinct was correct. Those who\r\nreally possessed capacity became leaders, took the command without\r\nany fuss or parade, and were obeyed, not because of their outward\r\nauthority, but because their real superiority was felt by all.\r\n\r\nThe score of students who commanded on the barricades in Berlin may be\r\ngiven as an instance. Many a so-called very ordinary man for a few days\r\nof his life showed himself to be a hero. During the first months some\r\nof the finest qualities of humanity displayed themselves and shone with\r\nastonishing lustre.\r\n\r\nIt was in Austria that the revolutionary movement began, immediately\r\nafter the arrival of the news of the Revolution of February in Paris.\r\nA speech made by Kossuth in the Hungarian Parliament on the 3rd of\r\nMarch, demanding constitutional government for all the provinces of the\r\nEmpire, inaugurated the revolution both in Buda-Pesth and Vienna. On\r\nthe 11th of March a similar demand was made by the Czechs in Prague,\r\nand before this, on the 6th of March, the Austrian Industrial Union\r\nhad presented a petition to Archduke Franz Karl, the presumptive heir\r\nto the throne, requesting Metternich's dismissal, and also demanding\r\nliberty of the press, the right of voting supplies, of taking part in\r\nlegislation, &c.\r\n\r\nOn this followed what has been called the petition storm. Every day,\r\nevery hour new petitions to the Emperor poured in. On the 12th of\r\nMarch the students held a great meeting at the University, the result\r\nof which was also a petition to the Emperor, demanding liberty of the\r\npress, religious liberty, and liberty of instruction. The Emperor\r\nreceived the deputation the following day, but gave an undecided\r\nanswer. In these unforeseen circumstances the 13th of March, the\r\nopening day of the Lower Austrian Convention of the Estates, arrived\r\nand found the Government unprepared. The populace crowded into the\r\nenclosure of the assembly hall, where Kossuth's speech was read aloud\r\namidst excited rejoicings and shouts of \"Hurrah for the constitution!\"\r\nA party forced their way into the hall and began to smash the furniture\r\nand throw it out on to the heads of the soldiers; even Archduke\r\nAlbrecht, who was in command, was struck by a block of wood. Then the\r\norder was given to fire, and the first Revolution of Vienna broke out.\r\nThe Italian troops fired, but the Austrians unscrewed their bayonets\r\namidst the joyful shouts of the crowd. At the Castle the gunners,\r\ninstead of shooting, placed themselves in front of their guns--as\r\nwe read in one of the poems of the day, Rick's _Das Lied vom braven\r\nKanonier_:\r\n\r\n   \"Vor der Burg in glühender Front,\r\n    Des blutgen Befehls gewärtig,\r\n    Vor der Burg in glühender Front,\r\n    Da stehn die Kanonen fertig.\r\n    Schon zittern die Thore, sie brechen schier,\r\n    Jetzt gilt's, du braver Kanonier!\r\n\r\n    Und du trittst vor die Mündung hin,\r\n    Als wolltest du fesseln den Würger--\r\n    Und du rufst mit begeistertem Sinn:\r\n    Erst mich! dann den wehrlosen Bürger!--\r\n    Dann schweigt das Commando, beschämt vor dir.\r\n    Hab Dank, du braver Kanonier!\"[2]\r\n\r\nTowards evening it became clear to Metternich that no concessions\r\nwould now avail. He who for forty years had led the policy of Austria\r\nhurriedly gave in his resignation and made his escape in disguise\r\nin the imperial laundry cart. At nine o'clock the same evening the\r\ntroops were withdrawn from Vienna (exactly a week before the same\r\nthing happened in Berlin), and citizens and students mounted guard\r\neverywhere. The arsenal was opened, and in one day arms were served out\r\nto 25,000 men.\r\n\r\nThere was some severe fighting in the outskirts of the town. So\r\nfiercely resolute were the populace that, all unarmed, they pressed in\r\nupon and disarmed two companies of grenadiers who were defending the\r\nentrance to Metternichs villa. Those who resisted were trampled under\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThat same evening the abolition of the censorship and liberty of the\r\npress were publicly announced. The intimation produced a feeling of\r\nintense relief--it was as if a gag had been removed from the mouth of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers, as a matter of course, instantaneously began to give\r\nexpression to the popular political ideas. It had hitherto been\r\nimpossible to treat even in poetic form any subject with a social or\r\npolitical tendency; Austria had resembled a forest where the voices of\r\nthe birds were silent. Now suddenly pipe and call, whistle and song,\r\nwere heard from every bush and tree, a mighty and confused chorus.[3]\r\n\r\nPoems of liberty were published in all the languages of Austria--German\r\nand Czech, Slavonian and Croatian, Hungarian, Polish, and Italian. So\r\neager were men to make use of their new liberty that a whole bevy of\r\npoems, superscribed _Erstes censurfreies Gedicht_ (\"First poem printed\r\nafter the abolition of the censure\"), appeared simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe one generally accepted as the first is Frankl's _Die Universität_.\r\nDuring the night between the 14th and 15th of March, one of the\r\nprofessors, fearing an outbreak of the prisoners, requested the armed\r\nstudents to despatch a guard to one of the prisons. Twenty students\r\nwere at once sent, under the command of Ludwig August Frankl. Whilst he\r\nstood on guard that young man gave expression to the feelings of the\r\nday in the song:\r\n\r\n   \"Was kommt heran mit kühnem Gange?\r\n    Die Waffe blinkt, die Fahne weht,\r\n    Es naht mit hellem Trommelklange\r\n                    Die Universität.\r\n     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n    Das freie Wort, das sie gefangen,\r\n    Seit Joseph arg verhöhnt, verschmäht,\r\n    Vorkämpfend sprengte seine Spangen\r\n                    Die Universität.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1890, on his eightieth birthday, Frankl published a large volume of\r\nable poetry; during his long life he has been an unusually productive\r\npoet and writer of biography; he has been presented with the freedom of\r\nVienna and of three other European and Asiatic towns; but this song,\r\nof which in course of time at least a hundred thousand copies were\r\nprinted, was what founded his reputation.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, really the first poem printed after the abolition\r\nof the censorship, for on the previous night Castelli had written his\r\nsong of the _Garde-National._ In the German language alone there are\r\nthree or four poems which lay claim to the same distinction. One of\r\nthese is the song of the Vienna student brigade,_ Erwacht, erwacht o\r\nBrüder! Ein grosser Morgen tagt_ (\"Awake, awake, O brothers! a great\r\nmorning is dawning\"), and another is Fr. Gerhard's _Die freie Presse_,\r\nwhich begins:\r\n\r\n   \"Die Presse frei! Die Glocken lasst ertönen\r\n    Und läutet Jubel überall!\r\n    Und ruft's hinaus zu Deutschlands fernsten Söhnen\r\n    Die Presse frei, erstürmt der Freiheit Wall![4]\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with these poems, which express such an innocent,\r\nexuberant delight at being able to speak and write without restraint,\r\nthere appeared others full of the most childish gratitude to the\r\nweak-minded Emperor. In them he is \"the good Emperor,\" \"our good\r\nFerdinand,\" &c, &c. People were ready to forget immediately that every\r\nsingle concession had been, not granted, but forcibly extorted, or\r\nelse they believed naïvely that this was the way to make their late\r\noppressors forget it. In one of the many songs in praise of the Emperor\r\nwe read:\r\n\r\n   \"Heil dir, mein Kaiser! in all der Lust\r\n    Zu der sich dein Volk ermannt hat,\r\n    Sei Dir vor Allen ein Heil gebracht,\r\n    Den es immer als edel erkannt hat.\"[5]\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of March the Hungarian deputation, 150 magnates with\r\nKossuth at their head, rode into Vienna, through the Prater, welcomed\r\nwith deafening cheers and showers of flowers. That day the number of\r\narmed citizens had risen to 60,000. In the afternoon a herald appeared\r\non the balcony of the Castle and read the following proclamation: \"We,\r\nFerdinand the First, by the grace of God Emperor of Austria and King\r\nof Hungary and Bohemia, of Lombardy and Venice, of Dalmatia, Croatia,\r\nSlavonia, Galicia, Illyria, &c, have now, in agreement with the wishes\r\nof our faithful people, decided to take certain steps.\" On this\r\nintroduction follows the announcement of the liberty of the press, the\r\nformation of the National Guard, and the convention of an assembly of\r\ndeputies for the purpose of drafting \"that constitution which we have\r\ndetermined to bestow on our country.\"\r\n\r\nSaphir sang:\r\n\r\n   \"Schwert aus der Scheid, aus dem Herzen das Lied!\r\n    Stimmt an das Lied der Lieder!\r\n    Jauchzend ertön' es durch Reihe und Glied,\r\n    Jauchzend durch jubelnde Brüder!\r\n    Blank wie die Waffe und hell wie der Stahl\r\n    Klinge das Lied von der Garde-National.\"[6]\r\n\r\nEven the mocking-birds, we see, on this occasion ceased from mocking\r\nand found voice to join in the universal chorus. In the persistent\r\nemployment of the French word, _Garde Nationale_, we have an example\r\nof the importation and imitation which so largely characterised the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nIn turning over the pages of a collection of the German political\r\npoems, several thousand in number, which were published in 1848 in\r\nVienna alone, we come upon many unknown names, but also upon almost\r\nall that were well known at that time and on many that were destined\r\nto become famous. We are struck by a poem of Bauernfeld's, _Wien an\r\ndie Provinzen_, weak from a literary point of view, but significant\r\nfrom its indication of the first sign of reaction, namely, an attempt\r\nmade in the provinces to shake off what was called the tyranny of the\r\ncapital; in other words, to counteract the influence of the example set\r\nby victorious, free Vienna. Friedrich Uhl, at a later period editor of\r\nthe _Wiener Abendpost_, the official organ of the Government, writes a\r\nlament for the fallen revolutionary heroes:\r\n\r\n   \"Das schwarze Band, den schwarzen Flor\r\n    Lasst in den Lüften wallen,\r\n    Den Todten singt ein Klagelied,\r\n    Die für die Freiheit gefallen.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThere are poems to Lenau, the most popular of living Austrian poets,\r\nbewailing that the singer of liberty is now insane and silent, his ears\r\ndeaf to the victors' joyful shouts. Richard Wagner, as yet unknown to\r\nfame, sends a \"Greeting from Saxony to Vienna\":\r\n\r\n   \"Ihr habt der Freiheit Art erkannt;\r\n    Nicht halb wird sie gewonnen;\r\n    Ist uns ihr kleinstes Glied entwandt,\r\n    Schnell ist sie ganz zeronnen.\r\n    Dies kleinste Glied ist unsre Ehre,\r\n    Ehrlos ist, wer es lässt,\r\n    Mit hellen Waffen, guter Wehre,\r\n    Drum hieltet Ihr es fest.\"[8]\r\n\r\nAmongst the writers of serious poems we find names like Grillparzer\r\nand Hebbel; Saphir and Dingelstedt write mock-heroic elegies on the\r\nlast of the censors, both of them parodies of Schiller's _Nadowessische\r\nTodesklage_; and there are no end of satiric thrusts at the King of\r\nPrussia, who, curiously enough, was considered to have acted heretofore\r\nin a more reactionary spirit, and now to be granting concessions more\r\nunwillingly than the Austrian Emperor.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of March Berlin had been in a state of the\r\nwildest excitement. Directly after the Revolution of February the\r\n_Kreuzzeitung_ published an article advocating war with France. It\r\nawakened extreme anxiety; people asked each other if long-suffering\r\nPrussia was actually to be compelled to take up arms against the French\r\nRepublic. It was in these days that all Germany began to deck itself\r\nin black, red, and gold, the colours symbolising unity and liberty.\r\nFreiligrath wrote of them:\r\n\r\n   \"In Kümmerniss und Dunkelheit\r\n    Da mussten wir sie bergen,\r\n    Nun haben wir sie doch befreit,\r\n    Befreit aus ihren Särgen;\r\n    Ha, wie das blitzt und rauscht und rollt!\r\n    Hurrah, du Schwarz, du Roth, du Gold!\r\n          Pulver ist schwarz,\r\n          Blut ist roth,\r\n          Golden flackert die Flamme!\"[9]\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of March the first great public meeting was held at In\r\nden Zelten. It was resolved to present an address to the King,\r\ndemanding that he should immediately convene the Landtag and grant a\r\nconstitution. The address ended with the words: \"No war with France!\r\nLawful liberty in our own country! Fraternal union of the whole great\r\nGerman nation!\" On the 12th of March a regiment of cavalry charged\r\nthe crowds at In den Zelten and dispersed them, but they collected\r\nagain in town, built barricades, and attempted to seize a gunsmith's\r\nshop in the Jägerstrasse. Two men were killed in front of the Opera\r\nHouse. Under the windows of the Castle the people shouted \"Liberty!\r\nLiberty of the press!\" and insulted the sentries. On the 14th of March\r\na general Landtag was summoned. So far things had been managed on\r\nthe whole peaceably; but on the 15th of March the soldiers, who were\r\nworn out with night-watching, and with having to hold themselves in\r\nconstant readiness in the barracks, began to behave roughly to the\r\ncrowd, to strike with the butt-ends of their guns, &c. Small barricades\r\nwhich some boys had erected at the corner of the Kurstrasse and the\r\nGertraudenstrasse were charged by the Cuirassier Guards from Potsdam,\r\nand the boys were cruelly handled.\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock on the 18th of March a royal proclamation was read\r\nin front of the Castle. It declared that Germany was to be from\r\nhenceforth not a federation of States, but one federated State\r\n(Staatenbund--Bundesstaat), with a common Parliament, a common army,\r\nfree-trade, liberty of emigration, and liberty of the press. At the end\r\nof each sentence the crowd answered with thundering hurrahs. Cries were\r\nheard of \"Away with the soldiers!\" and some stones were thrown. The\r\nfamous General von Pfuel, who was in command, forbade the soldiers to\r\nfire, ordered the dragoons to dismount, and praised the discipline they\r\nshowed in obeying at once, furious as they were. When the town seemed\r\nquiet he went home for a short time.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence, in consequence of an order given, no one knows by\r\nwhom, though the embittered populace during the following days laid\r\nthe blame of it on the Prince of Prussia, the future Emperor William,\r\na regiment of dragoon guards arrived. The crowd shouted \"Away!\" The\r\ndragoons wheeled round, and the crowd were beginning to cry \"Bravo!\"\r\nwhen suddenly the soldiers charged in amongst them with naked swords.\r\nAt the same moment a battalion of infantry marched out at the Castle\r\ngate, drew up in line, and also charged with levelled bayonets. Some\r\nshots were fired--possibly by accident. With loud shrieks the crowd\r\ninstantaneously dispersed. Only a moment before joy had been at its\r\nheight; strangers had been embracing each other, waving their hats,\r\nand shouting \"Hurrah for the King\"; now, as if at a preconcerted\r\nsignal, barricades sprang up, as they had done in Vienna, over the\r\nwhole town. There were two hundred of them, built of paving-stones,\r\ngutter-planking, and carts. The town was a camp. Men fired on the\r\ntroops from every roof; those who could not get guns, threw stones.\r\nEvery axe, every thick stick became a weapon.[10]\r\n\r\nThe roofs were torn off corner houses, and paving-stones were carried\r\nup in baskets. The students met, armed, in front of the University,\r\nfastened tri-coloured cockades in their caps, and proceeded to man the\r\nbarricades. Powder and shot, axes and iron bars, were provided by the\r\nmerchants. On the evening of the 18th, the artillery opened fire in\r\nthe Königstrasse. The King looked on from the windows of the Castle,\r\nincensed by the deputations that came entreating him to withdraw the\r\ntroops, but at times condescending to jest; what specially annoyed him\r\nwas the sight of the tri-coloured flags waving on the barricades. He\r\nwas ready, he said, to concede much to entreaty, nothing to illegal\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nVarnhagen, in his Diary, describes what he saw and heard from his\r\nwindows that night: \"Asmall body of citizens under trusty leaders held\r\nthe streets, doubly watchful because their numbers were so few. For a\r\nnumber of hours absolute darkness and silence prevailed; then, towards\r\nmorning, the sound of far-off drums was heard; troops were evidently\r\napproaching. The citizen combatants were instantly on the alert; we\r\ncould hear them whispering. A youthful voice gave the word of command:\r\n'To the roofs, gentlemen!' and every man went to his post. This calm,\r\ndetermined command, given with noble simplicity, rang terrible and yet\r\ninspiring through the darkness. One felt the dangers which those who\r\nobeyed it were braving, for the general resistance was becoming weaker,\r\nand it seemed as if they were doomed, after a fruitless struggle, to\r\nmeet an ignominious death, either by a fall from the roof, by the\r\nsoldiers' bayonets, or by the hand of the executioner.\" Varnhagen\r\nconcludes: \"The heroic courage and determination of these daring youths\r\nwas most undoubtedly worthy of all admiration\"--weighty words, coming\r\nfrom the pen of an old, experienced officer.\r\n\r\nOn the night between the 18th and 19th of March, wherever barricades\r\nwere being erected or repaired, the windows were illuminated. But\r\nthe moment troops entered the street all was darkness. The soldiers\r\nhewed and sabred right and left in the houses which they entered, and\r\nshowed mediæval brutality in their treatment of prisoners. Towards\r\nmorning the arsenal of the Garde-Landwehr regiment was captured by the\r\ninsurgents; they found that the locks of the guns had been destroyed,\r\nbut all the smiths of the quarter set to work and repaired the damage.\r\n\r\nAt last, in the course of the morning, a royal proclamation headed\r\n_An meine lieben Berliner!_ was circulated, in which an attempt was\r\nmade to explain the events of the day before as being the result of\r\nan unfortunate misunderstanding, \"It had been necessary to clear\r\nthe square in front of the Castle with cavalry, ordered to advance\r\nat a walking pace and with sheathed swords (_im Schritt und mit\r\neingesteckter Waffe_); two infantry muskets had about this time\r\ngone off by accident, fortunately injuring no one; a company of\r\nevil-disposed individuals, chiefly strangers, had taken advantage of\r\nthis unfortunate occurrence to stir up ideas of revenge in the minds\r\nof the excited crowd; the troops had used their weapons, but not until\r\ndriven to do so by being repeatedly fired at. The King promises that\r\nthe troops shall be withdrawn from Berlin, and concludes with the hope\r\nthat both parties will forget what has happened.\"[11]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the struggle raged on with frightful exasperation on both\r\nsides. In treating with the deputations that waited on him on the\r\nmorning of the 19th of March, the King attempted to make his promise\r\nof withdrawing the troops conditional on the dismantling of the\r\nbarricades. But in the end everything was conceded--change of ministry,\r\nrelease of the prisoners taken during the night, and withdrawal of\r\nthe troops. Amidst the shouts of the rejoicing crowd, to muffled beat\r\nof drum and Chorale-music, the soldiers were marched off to Potsdam,\r\nfeeling that they had sustained a deadly insult at the hands of their\r\nroyal commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nAn enormous crowd thronged to the Castle, partly consisting of\r\nthose who hoped by the force of numbers to exercise pressure on\r\ntheir vanquished rulers, partly of curious idlers; all the funeral\r\nprocessions from the streets where there had been fighting also made\r\ntheir way there. The corpses were borne on biers, or, where the numbers\r\nwere too great, conveyed in open waggons, decorated with flowers,\r\nribbons, and scarves, the corpses too being decked with flowers.\r\n\r\nEvery available space in the neighbourhood of the Castle was closely\r\npacked. The crowd demanded to see the King. With a pale face he stepped\r\nout on the balcony. \"Set the prisoners free!\" shouted the crowd, and\r\nhe was actually obliged to order the release of all those who were\r\nconfined in the cellars of the Castle. The next proceeding was the\r\ncarrying of many of the most severely wounded insurrectionists into the\r\nCastle, where their wounds were dressed. Now the funeral processions\r\nbegan to arrive, a sight by which the crowd was thrown into a state of\r\nthe wildest agitation. Whilst the corpses were being carried into one\r\nof the apartments on the first floor of the Castle, one orator after\r\nanother addressed the people. The speech which met with most approval\r\nwas one made by Karl Gutzkow, the refrain of which was \"general arming\r\nof the citizens.\" This the newly appointed ministers, who were moving\r\nabout among the crowd, vainly attempting to pacify them, were loth\r\nto concede, but they were soon compelled to do so, for a scene which\r\noccurred at this juncture made it impossible to resist the demands of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nA new funeral procession arrived--four corpses were borne on\r\nflower-decked biers through the crowd, their bloody wounds exposed to\r\nview for the purpose of rousing the beholders to revenge. The biers\r\nwere deposited below the King's balcony, and the bearers raised a wild\r\nshout of \"The King! The Queen!\" which found a thousand-fold echo among\r\nthe crowd. Two of the new ministers, Schwerin and Arnim, tried in vain\r\nto gain a hearing; their voices were drowned in the cry of \"The King!\r\nThe Queen!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the King and Queen actually appeared, on the balcony the people's\r\nfrenzy knew no bounds. The King to speak, but the bearers held high\r\nthe biers with their bloody burdens, and the crowd yelled \"Off with\r\nyour hat!\" And as each corpse was carried past the King was obliged to\r\nuncover.[12] In Freiligrath's grand poem, _Die Todten an die Lebenden_,\r\nwritten in the following year, the year of disillusion, we read:\r\n\r\n   \"Die Kugel mitten durch die Brust, die Stirne breit gespalten,\r\n    So habt Ihr uns auf blutgem Brett hoch in die Luft gehalten!\r\n    Hoch in die Luft mit wildem Schrei, das unsre Schmerzgeberde\r\n    Den, der zu tödten uns befahl, ein Fluch auf ewig werde!\r\n    Dass er sie sehe Tag und Nacht, im Wachen und im Traume--\r\n    Im Oeffnen seines Bibelbuchs und im Champagnerschaume!\r\n    Dass wie ein Brandmal sie sich tief in seine Seele brenne:\r\n    Dass nirgendwo und nimmermehr er vor ihr fliehen könne!\r\n    Dass jeder qualverzogene Mund, dass jede rothe Wunde\r\n    Ihn schrecke noch, ihn ängste noch in seiner letzten Stunde!\"[13]\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of March, at noon, the King rode out at the Castle gate\r\nwith a black, red, and gold band on his arm, and himself distributed\r\nblack, red, and gold favours. He was followed by the royal princes\r\nand the Ministers, who were in despair at the humiliating proceeding;\r\nat his side rode a veterinary surgeon, Urban by name. One of his\r\ngenerals had in vain attempted to dissuade him from taking this step.\r\nHe answered: \"Non, non, c'est décidé, nous allons monter à cheval.\"\r\nPresently he drew rein and spoke as follows: \"I am usurping no man's\r\nright when I declare that I believe myself called to be the saviour\r\nof the unity and liberty of Germany--that unity and liberty, based on\r\na free constitution, I will defend with the aid of German loyalty.\"\r\nAt the University he called for the professors and students, and said\r\nto them: \"Schreiben Sie sich's auf, meine Herren! Write down my words\r\nto you, for they are for posterity. I place myself at the head of the\r\nGerman nation; with its unity and liberty the existence of Prussia is\r\nhenceforth inseparably bound up. Write that down!\" At the arsenal,\r\nwhen he was again pouring forth promises, a piercing voice suddenly\r\ncried: \"Don't believe him, he is lying; he has always lied, and he is\r\nlying now. Tear me in pieces if you like, but I say he is lying--don't\r\nbelieve him!\"\r\n\r\nIn Vienna, a few days later, the following poem appeared:\r\n\r\n            \"PREUSSISCHE MISSVERSTAENDNISSE.\r\n    Im grossen ungläubigen Altberlin sind nun die Wunder zu Hause,\r\n    Da wird geschossen, gestürmt, gebrannt zwei Tage ohne Pause,\r\n    Bis tausende liegen im rothen Sand. Den König betrübt die Wendniss:\r\n    Die Flinten gingen von selber los. Das war nur ein Missverständniss.\r\n\r\n    Durch's grosse, ungläubige Altberlin gehn wunderbare Witze,\r\n    Ein König hüllt sich in Schwarz-Roth-Gold und stellt sich an\r\n        Deutschlands Spitze,\r\n    Ein König wird Ober-Demagog mit deutsch einheitlicher Sendniss,\r\n    Doch Deutschland lacht und ruft mit Macht: Das ist ein\r\n        Missverständniss.\"[14]\r\n\r\nAnother poem that bears witness to the irritated, sarcastic feeling\r\nprovoked by the events of these days is entitled _Erlkönig_, and begins:\r\n\r\n   \"Wer schiesst noch so spät auf's Volk ohne Wehr?\r\n    Es ist ein König mit seinem Heer.\r\n    Er hält sein Volk so treu im Arm,\r\n    Er fasst es so sicher mit seinen Gendarmes.\r\n\r\n    O Bürger, o Bürger, o hörest du nicht\r\n    Was Erlkönig in der Zeitung verspricht,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of March in the capitals of Germany did not call\r\nforth any particularly fine poetical effusions; it gave rise chiefly\r\nto street songs, inflammatory and ephemeral verse; but the counter\r\nrevolutions, the terrible re-capture of Vienna in October and of Berlin\r\nin November 1848, inspired a whole host of fine poems. The poets also\r\nfound inspiration in the martyr deaths of individual liberationists,\r\nwho either fell in fight or were murdered judicially after the\r\nsuppression of the revolution. The insurrection of Hungary, too, with\r\nits suppression by the Russian army, awakened a sympathy which found\r\nexpression in touching poems.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiastic ecstasy in Vienna was of short duration. The democrats\r\ndid not consider the free constitution free enough. A central\r\npolitical committee was formed as a sort of check on the government.\r\nThe existence of such a body was declared to be illegal, but popular\r\npressure compelled the government to retract this declaration and to\r\nsuspend the constitution. In the beginning of May the Emperor fled to\r\nInnsbruck. An attempt was made to disband the student brigade, but as\r\nthis led to a renewal of barricade fighting, the ministry were obliged\r\nto desist. The Emperor returned in August. During all this time the\r\ncapital was in a most excited state; the revolution had put a stop to\r\nevery kind of business, and the want of employment increased discontent\r\nand restlessness. A deep impression was made by the intelligence of\r\nthe events of June in Paris, Cavaignac's victory being regarded as\r\nequivalent to the suppression of the revolution in France. About the\r\nsame time came the news that Jellatschitsch, the Ban of Croatia, was\r\npreparing to invade Hungary. Intercepted letters showed that in this\r\nproceeding he had the support of the Court of Vienna and of Latour, the\r\nMinister of War; and the consequence was that Count Lamberg, Latour's\r\nenvoy, was torn to pieces by the mob on his arrival at Pesth (September\r\n28), and Latour himself, having declared his intention of despatching\r\ntroops to Hungary, was killed (October 7) by the enraged populace of\r\nVienna. In his poem, _Der 7 Oktober_, which is a eulogy of the murdered\r\nman, Dingelstedt takes the opportunity to dissociate himself from the\r\nrevolution and all its doings.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor now fled from Vienna for the second time. Whilst Radetzky\r\nsuppressed the insurrection in Lombardy, Windischgrätz, who had been\r\nappointed commander-in-chief, surrounded the capital with his troops.\r\nIn a struggle which lasted from the 24th to the 29th of October the\r\noutworks and outlying parts of the town were captured, and the city\r\nhad already been driven by want of provisions and ammunition to agree\r\nto the unconditional capitulation demanded by Windischgrätz, when the\r\ncry was heard in the streets: \"The Hungarians are coming.\" They had\r\nbeen seen from the tower of St. Stephen's Church. There was great\r\nrejoicing. The agreement to surrender was disregarded, the arms which\r\nhad already been given up were again seized at the arsenals, and\r\nsorties were made to support the Hungarians, whose cannonading was now\r\nheard. But the Hungarian army was completely routed by Jellatschitsch.\r\nWindischgrätz entered Vienna on the 31st of October, followed by\r\nJellatschitsch on the 2nd of November. A state of siege was proclaimed,\r\nand court-martials, sentences of death, and executions became the order\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the elections for the first German Parliament\r\nin Frankfort-on-Main, elections went on in Prussia for the Prussian\r\nConstitutional Assembly, which was opened by the King in May. This\r\nbody numbered few eminent members, the best men having been sent to\r\nFrankfort. Berlin was in an almost anarchic condition; the arsenal was\r\nstormed and plundered, the political clubs terrorised and coerced the\r\nAssembly. It rejected the constitution proposed by the government as\r\nnot sufficiently democratic. The result of this was a first change of\r\nministry. The new ministry made proposals which coincided more closely\r\nwith the wishes of the Assembly, but found themselves unable to agree\r\nto the demand of the majority that it should be made a point of honour\r\nwith all officers who disapproved of the new constitution to leave\r\nthe army. A third ministry, with Pfuel for its leader, was formed. On\r\nthe last day of October, while the Assembly was debating an appeal to\r\nthe government \"to support, by every means in its power, the cause of\r\npopular liberty, at present endangered in Vienna,\" a mob broke in on\r\nthe meeting, attempted to influence its decision by violent means,\r\nand insulted the Pfuel ministry. Then this ministry too resigned, and\r\non the 2nd of November the King put the reins of government into the\r\nhands of a war ministry, with his step-uncle, Count Brandenburg, at its\r\nhead. This new government decreed the transference of the Assembly from\r\nBerlin to Brandenburg, and brought the troops that had just returned\r\nfrom Denmark under General Wrangel to Berlin. The citizens were\r\ndisarmed and a state of siege was proclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe revolutions of Vienna and Berlin had been fruitless; alike\r\nfruitless were the proceedings of the first German Parliament\r\n(Reichstag), which met at Frankfort on the 18th of May 1848, and was\r\nforcibly dispersed by troops at Stuttgart on the 18th of June 1849.\r\nThe President it chose, Archduke John, did his best to subject it\r\nto the domination of Austria; it made a vain offer of the imperial\r\ncrown of Germany to Frederick William IV. in April 1849; its sacred\r\ninviolability was disregarded as early as November 1848, when\r\nWindischgrätz ordered the execution of one of its members, Robert Blum,\r\nat Brigittenau; it lost importance as a representative assembly by the\r\ngradual desertion of its conservative members. When it was dispersed at\r\nStuttgart, the reaction was once more triumphant throughout Europe:\r\n\r\n   \"Da sah man die letzten der Getreuen,\r\n    Die ausgeharrt beim Heiland, zerstreuen\r\n    Sich, wandernd nach alien Seiten und Winden,\r\n    Das Wort des Heiles zu verkünden,\r\n    Wohl wissend, dass ein langes Exil\r\n    Und Armuth, Noth und Dulden ihr Ziel,\r\n    Und Qual und Tod und Kerkermauern.\r\n    'Das Wort des Heils wird sie überdauern'\r\n    Das merkt euch, ihr Knechte und blutigen Horden:\r\n    Das Wort ist Fleisch und ist Gott geworden.[15]\r\n\r\nThus sang Moritz Hartmann, one of the last of the faithful. He rightly\r\nfelt that the ideas survived the outward changes.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1848 the poets of the revolution had nothing left to\r\nsing of but fallen heroes and extinguished hopes. Among these poets\r\nFreiligrath and Hartmann rank highest, and as typical of the elegies\r\nwritten on the fallen heroes, we may take the verses composed by these\r\ntwo authors on Robert Blum, whose firm, gentle character, simplicity,\r\nand prudence, stamped him in the minds of his contemporaries as the\r\nideal of a popular leader.\r\n\r\nIn his _Reimchronik_ Hartmann writes mournfully:\r\n\r\n   \"So ruhe sanft und gut, mein Robert!\r\n    Nicht braucht's der Wunsch, dass leicht dir werde\r\n    Die blutgetränkte Wiener Erde,\r\n    Der Boden, den du dir erobert.\r\n    Du bist nicht todt, trotz aller Klage\r\n    Des deutschen Volks, trotz aller Lieder.\r\n     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n    Ein Mythus geht: der Robert lebt,\r\n    Der Robert Blum, den sie erschossen\r\n    Und jedes deutsche Herz erbebt:\r\n    Das theure Blut ist nicht geflossen--\r\n    Die Hoffnung raunt uns in die Ohren:\r\n    Entflort, entflort die Trikoloren,\r\n    Noch, noch ist Deutschland nicht verloren.\r\n     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n    Allüberall ist der dabei!\r\n    Er wendet mit den Geisterhänden\r\n    Und fängt mit seiner Brust das Blei,\r\n    Das uns die Fürstenväter senden.\r\n     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n    Und wandeln muss er, bis entrafft\r\n    Das deutsche Volk sich dem Verräther\r\n    Bis er entfürstet und entpfafft\r\n    Den heilgen Boden seiner Väter.\"[16]\r\n\r\nAnd a week after Blum's death, Freiligrath writes the magnificent\r\nverses on the commemoration service in the Cathedral of Cologne, where\r\nthe mighty organ pealed forth Neukomm's requiem music:\r\n\r\n  \"Und heut in diesem selben Köln zum Weh'n des Winterwindes\r\n   Und zu der Orgel Brausen schallt das Grablied dieses Kindes.\r\n   Nicht singt die Ueberlebende, die Mutter, es dem Sohne:\r\n   Das ganze schmerzbewegte Köln singt es mit festem Tone.\r\n   Es spricht: Du, deren Schoos ihn trug, bleib still auf deinem Kammer!\r\n   Vor deinem Gott, du graues Haupt, ausströme deinen Jammer;\r\n   Auch ich bin seine Mutter, Weib! Ich und noch eine Hohe--\r\n   Ich und die Revolution, die hohe, lichterlohe!\r\n   Bleib du daheim mit deinem Schmerz! wir wahren seine Ehre--\r\n   Des Robert Requiem singt Köln, die revolutionäre.\r\n     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n   Was greift ihr zu den Schwertern nicht, Ihr Singer und Ihr Beter?\r\n   Was werdet Ihr Posaunen nicht, Ihr ehr'nen Orgeltuben,\r\n   Den jüngsten Tag ins Ohr zu schrein den Henkern und den Buben?\r\n   Den Henkern, die ihn hingestreckt auf der Brigittenaue--\r\n   Auf festen Knien lag er da im ersten Morgenthaue!\r\n   Dann sank er hin--hin in sein Blut--lautlos!--heut vor acht Tagen!\r\n   Zwei Kugeln haben ihm die Brust, eine das Haupt zerschlagen.\"[17]\r\n\r\nIt is to Hartmann's _Reimchronik des Pfaffen Mauritius_ that we must\r\nhave recourse if we desire to view all the successive events and\r\nimpressions of 1848 in the mirror of poetry. Many of the details\r\nof this poem have become difficult to understand; the reader of\r\nto-day comes upon lists of names, of whose owners he knows little or\r\nnothing--men like Bassermann, the parliamentary debater, and Hansemann,\r\nthe financier, in their day famous members of the Parliament of\r\nFrankfort, now forgotten--but from parts of it, without the assistance\r\nof any commentary, he gains a vivid impression of men's feelings, of\r\ntheir exalted frame of mind, in that year of revolution. Very affecting\r\nis a final outburst, in which the poet bewails the want of men:\r\n\r\n   \"Ich seh' Gelehrte und Professoren\r\n    Und Präsidenten und Assessoren,\r\n    Weinküfer seh' ich und Redakteure\r\n    Superintendenten und Accoucheure\r\n    Und Börsenleute und Zeitungsschreiber,\r\n    Astronomen und Steuereintreiber,\r\n    Lumpenhändler und Alterthumskenner,\r\n    Biedermänner, Hansemänner, Bassermänner--\r\n    Allein wo sind die _Männer_, die _Männer?_ \"[18]\r\n\r\nWhen Hartmann wrote these words he was living on the shores of the Lake\r\nof Geneva, a banished man, and the best men of Germany and Austria who\r\nhad survived the great discomfiture were either in prison or, like\r\nhimself, in exile.\r\n\r\n1848 is a year of no decisive political significance, although it\r\nwas in this year that the old order of things was for the first time\r\ndisturbed simultaneously in almost every country of Europe. The\r\nlocal revolutions of 1789 and 1830, whatever they resulted in, were\r\nsuccessful revolutions, but the general European revolution of 1848 was\r\nnothing in any single country but an unsuccessful attempt.\r\n\r\nYet 1848 is a year of great spiritual significance. After it men\r\nfeel and think and write quite otherwise than they did before it. In\r\nliterature it is the red line of separation that divides our century\r\nand marks the beginning of a new era. It was a year of jubilee, like\r\nthat instituted by the old Hebrew law, that fiftieth year, in which\r\nthe trumpet was to be sounded throughout all the land, which was to be\r\nhallowed, and in which liberty was to be proclaimed \"throughout all the\r\nland unto all the inhabitants thereof\" (Lev. xxv. 8, &c). This year,\r\nwith its quick heart-beat, its all-subduing youthful ardour, was, like\r\nthat Bible year of jubilee, a year of returning into possession, a year\r\nof redemption, in which \"they that had been sold were redeemed again.\"\r\nTo this day we imbibe youthful enthusiasm from its days of March and\r\nlearn important lessons from its days of November.\r\n\r\nIt is the year of jubilee, the year of mourning, the boundary year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 'Twas in the mountains the first shot was fired--in the mountains,\r\nagainst the priests! That shot loosened the avalanche--three countries\r\nsprang to arms! Switzerland can already rest on her laurels; the\r\neternal mountains are trembling to their centres with joy.\r\n\r\nThe sport soon spread to Italy--Scylla and Charybdis, Vesuvius and\r\nEtna broke loose; explosion upon explosion, blow upon blow!' \"This is\r\nbecoming serious, my royal, my imperial brother!\" is the message from\r\nVienna to Berlin, from Berlin to Vienna; even Nick begins to tremble.\r\n\r\nAnd now the paving-stones are once more torn up, the stones of those\r\nstreets on to which ere now two kings have been ruthlessly flung by\r\narmed liberty.\r\n\r\n[2] In front of the castle in threatening line stand the cannon,\r\nawaiting the word of command--the gates are shuddering and\r\nyielding--the moment has come, brave gunner!\r\n\r\nForward to the muzzle he goes, as if the order had been to stop the\r\nmouths of the destroyers; fearlessly he cries: \"First me, then the\r\ndefenceless citizen!\"--No farther command is given. Thou hast shamed\r\nthem! All thanks to thee, brave gunner!\r\n\r\n[3] Frhr. von Helfert: _Wiener Parnass im Jahre_ 1848.\r\n\r\n[4] The press is free! Peal the bells! sound the glad tidings far and\r\nwide! Proclaim to the farthest-off of Germany's sons: The press is\r\nfree, the ramparts of liberty are stormed!\r\n\r\n[5] All hail to thee, my Emperor! Full of joy in their accomplished\r\nwork, thy people greet thee, whom they have always known to be of noble\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n[6] As your swords leap from their scabbards, let a song, O my\r\nbrothers, come from your hearts! Let the song of songs resound through\r\nyour rejoicing ranks--bright as burnished armour, clear as ringing\r\nsteel, the song of the Garde-National!\r\n\r\n[7] Let the black draperies flutter in the wind, and let a sad lament\r\nresound for those who have laid down their lives in the cause of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n[8] Ye have rightly understood the nature of liberty; we cannot half\r\npossess her; if we but let her little finger be taken from us, she will\r\nsoon be gone. That little finger is our honour. Who lets that go knows\r\nnot what honour is. Therefore with strong arms and good swords ye have\r\ndefended it.\r\n\r\n[9]\r\n\r\n    In secret hiding-place and gloom\r\n      Long time we have concealed it;\r\n    But now at last the day is come,\r\n      The day that has revealed it.\r\n    Ha! how the smoke is round it rolled!\r\n    Hurrah! thou Black and Red and Gold!\r\n             Powder is black,\r\n             Blood is red,\r\n             Golden glows the flame!\r\n                                 (JOYNES.)\r\n\r\n[10] _Des deutschen Volkes Erhebung im Jahre_ 1848, _sein Kampf um\r\nfreie Institutionen und sein Siegesjubel._ Von J.

We see the spirit of Metternich,\r\na spirit of shallowness, brooding over Austria and the whole of\r\nGermany. We follow the new intellectual movement from the time when it\r\nfirst finds expression at the Wartburg Festival in 1817. We see how\r\nthe assassination of Kotzebue gives occasion to the open persecution\r\nof Liberalism and introduces a long period of ruthless reaction and\r\noppression, during which Goethe is regarded as the Quietist foe of\r\nliberty and lauded or denounced as such, and German philosophy under\r\nthe auspices of Hegel becomes, in a rather questionable manner,\r\nconservative. The oppositionist tendency finds occasional expression in\r\nthe writings of poets like Chamisso, Platen, and Heine, but the general\r\nintellectual condition is one of depression, relieved by outbursts of\r\nself-ridicule. The state of stagnation is put an end to by the news\r\nof the Revolution of July 1830, which electrifies public feeling and\r\ngives both poets and prose writers new courage and fresh inspiration.\r\nThe remembrance of Byron's life and death influences men in the same\r\ndirection, and the Polish revolt awakens sympathy and enthusiasm in\r\nspite of the part that Germany takes in the annihilation of Poland as\r\na nation. Börne becomes the most eminent advocate of Liberalism in\r\npolitics, holds high the banner of liberty and justice, shows a noble\r\nexample in the matter of strength of character and conviction, but at\r\nthe same time displays a naïve and fanatical optimism which proves\r\nthat his is not the temperament required in a statesman. In Heine, the\r\ngreatest poet of the period, we feel the vibration of its every nerve.\r\nIn him modern poetry casts off the swaddling-clothes of Romanticism.\r\nIn love, in appreciation of nature, in his political, social, and\r\nreligious views, in his descriptive, poetic, and satiric style, he is\r\nthe man of our own day--fitter, as we pointed out, than any other to\r\ngrapple with modern life in its hardness and ugliness, its charm and\r\nits restlessness, and its wealth of violent contrasts. About the same\r\ntime, in a different and yet kindred manner, Immermann, in his best\r\nbook, marks the transition to a more realistic style of art.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of July had not only changed the tone of literature,\r\nit had also altered the character of the Hegelian philosophy, which\r\nfrom this time onwards is to be regarded as one of the strongest\r\ninfluences in the revolutionising of men's conception of life; from\r\nthe doctrines of the master who died such a strong Conservative, his\r\npupils draw reformatory or revolutionary inferences and principles.\r\nAnd now, with the echoes of the Revolution of July sounding in their\r\nears, appear a group of young authors; they are influenced by the\r\nphilosophy of Hegel and the poetry of Goethe, this last interpreted as\r\nanti-Christian; Heine and Börne are their masters, Rahel and George\r\nSand their muses; they come to be known by the name of Young Germany.\r\nThey desire to assimilate literature with life, to subvert existing\r\nreligious and moral doctrines, to introduce a freer morality in the\r\nmatter of marriage and divorce and a new species of pantheistic piety.\r\nThe impeachment of these men by Menzel in 1835 is the signal for a\r\nnew series of persecutions directed against all that in that day went\r\nby the name of the literature of movement (Bewegungslitteratur). Very\r\nfew of the representatives of the young generation show strength of\r\ncharacter when thus put to the test, but both the highly gifted men\r\n(Gutzkow) and those of moderate ability (Laube, &c.) develop their\r\ntalents amidst these persecutions, and works are produced which\r\naccurately mirror the hopes and struggles of the age, the thoughts and\r\nfeelings, temptations, mistakes, and victories of the individual.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1830 and 1840 something has been happening quietly,\r\ndeep down in men's minds--Goethe's poetry and Goethe's philosophy of\r\nlife, at first championed exclusively by enthusiastic women, have been\r\nsteadily gaining influence over the cultivated, making them proof\r\nagainst theological impressions but receptive to all great human ideas.\r\nThe cult of Goethe leads by degrees, even in the case of women, to the\r\ncult of political liberty and social reform.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 German philosophy begins to develop in the direction of\r\nRadicalism, and the poets begin openly to advocate the cause of\r\npolitical liberty. The men of this new generation, too, owe their\r\nphilosophic training to Hegel, but they have metamorphosed his doctrine\r\ninto an atheistical, anti-monarchical doctrine. They regard the\r\nstandpoint of Young Germany with contempt as being purely belletristic,\r\nand busy themselves with the nature of Christianity and the idea of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nOn the throne of Prussia at this juncture sits a king with a curiously\r\ncomplex character and many talents, a typical transition figure,\r\nwhose personality, especially in its relation to the literature and\r\nintellectual life of the day, is of great interest. In the south of\r\nGermany it is Metternich, in the north it is Frederick William IV., who\r\noutwardly regulates the course of events. We see literary and political\r\ncelebrities being attracted by him, coming into collision with him,\r\nand rebounding from him. The invalids of literature, men like Tieck\r\nand Schelling, pass their last days under his protection; Herwegh\r\nand Freiligrath are first attracted and then repelled by him; Jacoby\r\nattacks him, Dingelstedt ridicules him.\r\n\r\nAnd now we follow the development of political poetry, from its founder\r\nAnastasius Grün to Herwegh and Dingelstedt, observing what a deep\r\nimpression such a thinker as Ludwig Feuerbach makes on the intellectual\r\nlife of his contemporaries. Men like Freiligrath and Prutz, Sallet and\r\nHartmann, are the petrels that foretell the storm; in 1848 we hear\r\nthe song of certain gifted poets high above the roar of the political\r\nhurricane, and we also notice that these unexampled occurrences\r\ntransform men of minor or undeveloped talent into organs of the great\r\nmovement of the hour.\r\n\r\nDuring our study of this fragment of literary history we have passed\r\nin review a whole gallery of remarkable figures, devoting careful\r\nattention to the most important or most typical.\r\n\r\nWe saw how Napoleon's great personality, in its legendary form,\r\nexercised almost as powerful an influence on men's minds as Byron's.\r\nOf the great intellectual forces of the eighteenth century, Goethe,\r\nJean Paul, Heinse, and Hegel are those by which our period is most\r\nperceptibly influenced. Some of the Romanticists influence as\r\nteachers and masters (Wilhelm Schlegel, Brentano, Chamisso), others\r\nas antagonists (Tieck). Börne and Heine, geniuses of most dissimilar\r\ntypes, by virtue of that polemical quality which was an essential\r\ncharacteristic of both, influence the whole period.\r\n\r\nWhat a wealth of remarkable, original characters! Glance at our gallery\r\nof women--Rahel and Bettina, the friends of Goethe; Börne's friends,\r\nHenrietta Herz and Jeannette Wohl; Heine's La Mouche, Immermann's\r\nElisa, and Princess Pückler and Charlotte Stieglitz--gifted women\r\nand devoted wives! Or let your eyes wander over our collection of\r\nmale portraits--authors and men of the world, like Varnhagen and\r\nPückler; stiff, stately figures, like Platen and Immermann; others\r\nthat are all life and fire, like Börne and Heine; manly eccentrics,\r\nlike Jacoby; kingly figures, like Feuerbach; grimacing fanatics, like\r\nMenzel; independent poets great and small, like Rückert, Hebbel,\r\nLudwig, and Scherenberg; agitators, like Wienbarg and Gutzkow; men of\r\npliant talent, like Laube and Mundt; weak desponders, like Stieglitz;\r\nbold singers of liberty, like Hoffmann and Freiligrath; immature\r\ncharacters, like Herwegh; problematic characters, like Dingelstedt and\r\nMeissner; brave men, like Sallet, Hartmann, and Prutz. Even when their\r\nproductions are not of the highest quality, we study the men themselves\r\nwith interest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd yet what is presented in this volume can only be fully understood\r\nby those who read it in its connection with the earlier volumes of the\r\nwork of which it forms a part, who regard it in the light of the last\r\nact of a great historic drama. The plan of the work is indicated in the\r\nintroduction to the first volume, and is strictly adhered to throughout\r\nall six.\r\n\r\nThe author's intention, as explained in the first lines of his work,\r\nwas, by means of the study of certain main groups and main movements\r\nin European literature, to outline a psychology of the first half\r\nof the nineteenth century. The year 1848, which, as a historical\r\nturning-point, marks a conclusion for the time being, was indicated as\r\nthe point to which he intended to pursue his subject. The six groups\r\nwhich, according to the original plan, have been portrayed, are, the\r\nFrench Emigrant Literature, German Romanticism, the French Reaction,\r\nEnglish Naturalism, French Romanticism, and Young Germany. Each one\r\nof the six parts of the work has in the course of years either been\r\nre-written or revised.\r\n\r\nThe author's first proceeding was to separate and classify the chief\r\nliterary movements of the first half of the century, his next to find\r\ntheir general direction or law of progression, a starting point, and a\r\ncentral point.\r\n\r\nThe direction he discovered to be a great rhythmical ebb and flow--the\r\ngradual dying out and disappearing of the ideas and feelings of the\r\neighteenth century until authority, the hereditary principle, and\r\nancient custom once more reigned supreme, then the reappearance of the\r\nideas of liberty in ever higher mounting waves. The starting point\r\nwas now self-evident, namely, the group of French literary works\r\ndenominated the Emigrant Literature, the first epoch-making one of\r\nwhich bears the date 1800. The central point was equally unmistakable.\r\nFrom the literary point of view it was Byron's death, from the\r\npolitical that Greek war of liberation in which he fell. This double\r\nevent is epoch-making in the intellectual life and the literature\r\nof the Continent. The concluding point was also clearly indicated,\r\nnamely, the European revolution of 1848. Byron's death forming the\r\ncentral point of the work, the school of English literature to which\r\nhe belongs, became as it were the hinge on which it turned. The main\r\noutlines now stood out clearly: the incipient reaction in the case of\r\nthe emigrants, held in check by the revolutionary ideas still in vogue;\r\nthe growth of the reaction in the Germany of the Romanticists; its\r\nculmination and triumph during the first year of the Restoration in\r\nFrance; the turn of the tide discernible in what is denominated English\r\nNaturalism; the change which takes place in all the great writers of\r\nFrance shortly before the Revolution of July, a change which results\r\nin the formation of the French Romantic school; and, lastly, the\r\ndevelopment in German literature which issues in the events of March\r\n1848.\r\n\r\nIt is self-evident that the standpoint here adopted is a personal\r\none. It is the personal point of view, the personal treatment, which\r\npresents literary personages and works thus grouped and ordered, thus\r\ncontrasted, thus thrown into relief or cast into shadow. Regarded\r\nimpersonally, the literature of a half-century is nothing but a chaos\r\nof hundreds of thousands of books in many languages.\r\n\r\nThe personal standpoint is not, however, an arbitrary one. It has\r\nbeen the author's aim to do justice, as far as in him lay, to every\r\nsingle person and phenomenon he has described. No attempt has been made\r\nto fit any of them into larger or smaller places than they actually\r\noccupied. It is no whim or preconceived intention of the author that\r\nhas given the work its shape. The power which has grouped, contrasted,\r\nthrown into relief or suppressed, lengthened or shortened, placed in\r\nfull light, in half light, or in shadow, is none other than that never\r\nentirely conscious power to which we usually give the name of art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
