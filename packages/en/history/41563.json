For not only does that literature possess much intrinsic\r\nmerit, but the light it sheds on the life and thought of the population\r\nof our Indian Empire ought to have a peculiar interest for the\r\nBritish nation. Owing chiefly to the lack of an adequate account\r\nof the subject, few, even of the young men who leave these shores\r\nevery year to be its future rulers, possess any connected information\r\nabout the literature in which the civilisation of Modern India can\r\nbe traced to its sources, and without which that civilisation cannot\r\nbe fully understood. It was, therefore, with the greatest pleasure\r\nthat I accepted Mr. Gosse's invitation to contribute a volume to this\r\nseries of Literatures of the World; for this appeared to me to be a\r\npeculiarly good opportunity for diffusing information on a subject\r\nin which more than twenty years of continuous study and teaching had\r\ninstilled into me an ever-deepening interest.\r\n\r\nProfessor Max Müller's valuable History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature\r\nis limited in its scope to the Vedic period. It has long been out of\r\nprint; and Vedic research has necessarily made great strides in the\r\nforty years which have elapsed since its publication.\r\n\r\nThe only book accessible to the English reader on the history of\r\nSanskrit literature in general has hitherto been the translation\r\nof Professor Weber's Academical Lectures on Indian Literature,\r\nas delivered nearly half a century ago at Berlin. The numerous and\r\noften very lengthy notes in this work supply the results of research\r\nduring the next twenty-five years; but as these notes often modify,\r\nor even cancel, the statements of the unaltered original text of\r\n1852, the result is bewildering to the student. Much new light has\r\nbeen thrown on various branches of Sanskrit literature since 1878,\r\nwhen the last notes were added to this translation, which, moreover,\r\nis not in any way adapted to the wants of the general reader. The\r\nonly work on the subject appealing to the latter is the late Sir\r\nM. Monier-Williams's Indian Wisdom. That book, however, although it\r\nfurnishes, in addition to the translated specimens, some account of\r\nthe chief departments of Sanskrit literature, is not a history. There\r\nis thus distinctly a twofold demand in this country for a history\r\nof Sanskrit literature. The student is in want of a guide setting\r\nforth in a clear and trustworthy manner the results of research down\r\nto the present time, and the cultivated English reader looks for a\r\nbook presenting in an intelligible and attractive form information\r\nwhich must have a special interest to us owing to our close relations\r\nwith India.\r\n\r\nTo lack of space, no less than to the scope of the present series,\r\nis due the exclusion of a full account of the technical literature\r\nof law, science, and art, which contains much that would interest\r\neven the general reader; but the brief epitome given in the Appendix\r\nwill, I hope, suffice to direct the student to all the most important\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nAs to the bibliographical notes, I trust that, though necessarily\r\nrestricted in extent, they will enable the student to find all\r\nfurther information he may want on matters of detail; for instance,\r\nthe evidence for approximate dates, which had occasionally to be\r\nsummarily stated even in the text.\r\n\r\nIn writing this history of Sanskrit literature, I have dwelt more on\r\nthe life and thought of Ancient India, which that literature embodies,\r\nthan would perhaps have appeared necessary in the case of a European\r\nliterature. This I have done partly because Sanskrit literature,\r\nas representing an independent civilisation entirely different from\r\nthat of the West, requires more explanation than most others; and\r\npartly because, owing to the remarkable continuity of Indian culture,\r\nthe religious and social institutions of Modern India are constantly\r\nillustrated by those of the past.\r\n\r\nBesides the above-mentioned works of Professors Max Müller and Weber,\r\nI have made considerable use of Professor L. von Schroeder's excellent\r\nIndiens Literatur und Cultur (1887). I have further consulted in one\r\nway or another nearly all the books and monographs mentioned in the\r\nbibliographical notes. Much of what I have written is also based on\r\nmy own studies of Sanskrit literature.\r\n\r\nAll the quotations which I have given by way of illustration I have\r\nmyself carefully selected from the original works. Excepting the short\r\nextracts on page 333 from Cowell and Thomas's excellent translation\r\nof the Harshacharita, all the renderings of these are my own. In my\r\nversions of Rigvedic stanzas I have, however, occasionally borrowed a\r\nline or phrase from Griffith. Nearly all my renderings are as close as\r\nthe use of metre permits. I have endeavoured to reproduce, as far as\r\npossible, the measures of the original, except in the quotations from\r\nthe dramas, where I have always employed blank verse. I have throughout\r\nrefrained from rhyme, as misrepresenting the original Sanskrit.\r\n\r\nIn the transliteration of Sanskrit words I have been guided by the\r\ndesire to avoid the use of letters which might mislead those who do\r\nnot know Sanskrit. I have therefore departed in a few particulars\r\nfrom the system on which Sanskrit scholars are now almost unanimously\r\nagreed, and which I otherwise follow myself. Hence for c and ch I have\r\nwritten ch and chh respectively, though in the rare cases where these\r\ntwo appear in combination I have retained cch (instead of chchh). I\r\nfurther use sh for the lingual s, and ç for the palatal s, and ri\r\nfor the vowel r. I have not thought it necessary to distinguish the\r\nguttural n and the palatal ñ by diacritical marks, simply printing,\r\nfor instance, anga and pancha. The reader who is unacquainted with\r\nSanskrit will thus pronounce all words correctly by simply treating\r\nall the consonants as in English; remembering only that the vowels\r\nshould be sounded as in Italian, and that e and o are always long.\r\n\r\nI am indebted for some suggestions to my friend Mr. F. C. S. Schiller,\r\nFellow and Tutor of Corpus Christi College, who looked through the\r\nfinal proof of the chapter on Philosophy. To my pupil Mr. A. B. Keith,\r\nBoden Sanskrit scholar and Classical scholar of Balliol, who has read\r\nall the final proofs with great care, I owe not only the removal of\r\na number of errors of the press, but also several valuable criticisms\r\nregarding matters of fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n107 Banbury Road, Oxford,\r\nDecember 1, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAP.

After\r\nAlexander's invasion, the Greeks became to some extent acquainted\r\nwith the learning of the Indians; the Arabs, in the Middle Ages,\r\nintroduced the knowledge of Indian science to the West; a few European\r\nmissionaries, from the sixteenth century onwards, were not only\r\naware of the existence of, but also acquired some familiarity with,\r\nthe ancient language of India; and Abraham Roger even translated the\r\nSanskrit poet Bhartrihari into Dutch as early as 1651. Nevertheless,\r\ntill about a hundred and twenty years ago there was no authentic\r\ninformation in Europe about the existence of Sanskrit literature, but\r\nonly vague surmise, finding expression in stories about the wisdom\r\nof the Indians. The enthusiasm with which Voltaire in his Essai sur\r\nles Moeurs et l'Esprit des Nations greeted the lore of the Ezour\r\nVedam, a work brought from India and introduced to his notice in\r\nthe middle of the last century, was premature. For this work was\r\nlater proved to be a forgery made in the seventeenth century by\r\na Jesuit missionary. The scepticism justified by this fabrication,\r\nand indulged in when the discovery of the genuine Sanskrit literature\r\nwas announced, survived far into the present century. Thus, Dugald\r\nStewart, the philosopher, wrote an essay in which he endeavoured\r\nto prove that not only Sanskrit literature, but also the Sanskrit\r\nlanguage, was a forgery made by the crafty Brahmans on the model of\r\nGreek after Alexander's conquest. Indeed, this view was elaborately\r\ndefended by a professor at Dublin as late as the year 1838.\r\n\r\nThe first impulse to the study of Sanskrit was given by the practical\r\nadministrative needs of our Indian possessions. Warren Hastings,\r\nat that time Governor-General, clearly seeing the advantage of\r\nruling the Hindus as far as possible according to their own laws\r\nand customs, caused a number of Brahmans to prepare a digest based\r\non the best ancient Indian legal authorities. An English version\r\nof this Sanskrit compilation, made through the medium of a Persian\r\ntranslation, was published in 1776. The introduction to this work,\r\nbesides giving specimens of the Sanskrit script, for the first\r\ntime supplied some trustworthy information about the ancient Indian\r\nlanguage and literature. The earliest step, however, towards making\r\nEurope acquainted with actual Sanskrit writings was taken by Charles\r\nWilkins, who, having, at the instigation of Warren Hastings, acquired\r\na considerable knowledge of Sanskrit at Benares, published in 1785\r\na translation of the Bhagavad-gita, or The Song of the Adorable One,\r\nand two years later, a version of the well-known collection of fables\r\nentitled Hitopadeça, or Friendly Advice.\r\n\r\nSir William Jones (1746-94) was, however, the pioneer of Sanskrit\r\nstudies in the West. It was this brilliant and many-sided Orientalist\r\nwho, during his too brief career of eleven years in India, first\r\naroused a keen interest in the study of Indian antiquity by his\r\nunwearied literary activity and by the foundation of the Asiatic\r\nSociety of Bengal in 1784. Having rapidly acquired an accurate\r\nknowledge of Sanskrit, he published in 1789 a translation of Çakuntala,\r\nthe finest Sanskrit drama, which was greeted with enthusiasm by such\r\njudges as Herder and Goethe. This was followed by a translation of\r\nthe Code of Manu, the most important of the Sanskrit law-books. To Sir\r\nWilliam Jones also belongs the credit of having been the first man who\r\never printed an edition of a Sanskrit text. This was a short lyrical\r\npoem entitled Ritusamhara, or Cycle of the Seasons, published in 1792.\r\n\r\nWe next come to the great name of Henry Thomas Colebrooke (1765-1837),\r\na man of extraordinary industry, combined with rare clearness of\r\nintellect and sobriety of judgment. The first to handle the Sanskrit\r\nlanguage and literature on scientific principles, he published many\r\ntexts, translations, and essays dealing with almost every branch of\r\nSanskrit learning, thus laying the solid foundations on which later\r\nscholars have built.\r\n\r\nWhile Colebrooke was beginning his literary career in India during\r\nthe opening years of the century, the romance of war led to the\r\npractical knowledge of Sanskrit being introduced on the Continent of\r\nEurope. Alexander Hamilton (1765-1824), an Englishman who had acquired\r\na good knowledge of Sanskrit in India, happened to be passing through\r\nFrance on his way home in 1802. Hostilities breaking out afresh just\r\nthen, a decree of Napoleon, directed against all Englishmen in the\r\ncountry, kept Hamilton a prisoner in Paris. During his long involuntary\r\nstay in that city he taught Sanskrit to some French scholars, and\r\nespecially to the German romantic poet Friedrich Schlegel. One of the\r\nresults of these studies was the publication by Schlegel of his work\r\nOn the Language and Wisdom of the Indians (1808). This book produced\r\nnothing less than a revolution in the science of language by the\r\nintroduction of the comparative and the historical method. It led to\r\nthe foundation of the science of comparative philology by Franz Bopp\r\nin his treatise on the conjugational system of Sanskrit in comparison\r\nwith that of Greek, Latin, Persian, and German (1816). Schlegel's work,\r\nmoreover, aroused so much zeal for the study of Sanskrit in Germany,\r\nthat the vast progress made since his day in this branch of learning\r\nhas been mainly due to the labours of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of Sanskrit studies Europeans became acquainted\r\nonly with that later phase of the ancient language of India which is\r\nfamiliar to the Pandits, and is commonly called Classical Sanskrit. So\r\nit came about that the literature composed in this dialect engaged\r\nthe attention of scholars almost exclusively down to the middle of\r\nthe century. Colebrooke had, it is true, supplied as early as 1805\r\nvaluable information about the literature of the older period in his\r\nessay On the Vedas. Nearly a quarter of a century later, F. Rosen,\r\na German scholar, had conceived the plan of making this more ancient\r\nliterature known to Europe from the rich collection of manuscripts\r\nat the East India House; and his edition of the first eighth of the\r\nRigveda was actually brought out in 1838, shortly after his premature\r\ndeath. But it was not till Rudolf Roth (1821-95), the founder of Vedic\r\nphilology, published his epoch-making little book On the Literature\r\nand History of the Veda in 1846, that the studies of Sanskritists\r\nreceived a lasting impulse in the direction of the earlier and more\r\nimportant literature of the Vedas. These studies have since been\r\nprosecuted with such zeal, that nearly all the most valuable works\r\nof the Vedic, as well as the later period, have within the last fifty\r\nyears been made accessible in thoroughly trustworthy editions.\r\n\r\nIn judging of the magnitude of the work thus accomplished, it should\r\nbe borne in mind that the workers have been far fewer in this than\r\nin other analogous fields, while the literature of the Vedas at least\r\nequals in extent what survives of the writings of ancient Greece. Thus\r\nin the course of a century the whole range of Sanskrit literature,\r\nwhich in quantity exceeds that of Greece and Rome put together, has\r\nbeen explored. The great bulk of it has been edited, and most of its\r\nvaluable productions have been translated, by competent hands. There\r\nhas long been at the service of scholars a Sanskrit dictionary, larger\r\nand more scientific than any either of the classical languages yet\r\npossesses. The detailed investigations in every department of Sanskrit\r\nliterature are now so numerous, that a comprehensive work embodying the\r\nresults of all these researches has become a necessity. An encyclopædia\r\ncovering the whole domain of Indo-Aryan antiquity has accordingly been\r\nplanned on a more extensive scale than that of any similar undertaking,\r\nand is now being published at Strasburg in parts, contributed to by\r\nabout thirty specialists of various nationalities. By the tragic death,\r\nin April 1898, of its eminent editor, Professor Bühler of Vienna,\r\nSanskrit scholarship has sustained an irreparable loss. The work begun\r\nby him is being completed by another very distinguished Indianist,\r\nProfessor Kielhorn of Göttingen.\r\n\r\nAlthough so much of Sanskrit literature has already been published,\r\nan examination of the catalogues of Sanskrit manuscripts, of which\r\nan enormous number are preserved in European and Indian libraries,\r\nproves that there are still many minor works awaiting, and likely to\r\nrepay, the labours of an editor.\r\n\r\nThe study of Sanskrit literature deserves far more attention than it\r\nhas yet received in this country. For in that ancient heritage the\r\nlanguages, the religious and intellectual life and thought, in short,\r\nthe whole civilisation of the Hindus, who form the vast majority of\r\nthe inhabitants of our Indian Empire, have their roots. Among all\r\nthe ancient literatures, that of India is, moreover, undoubtedly in\r\nintrinsic value and æsthetic merit second only to that of Greece. To\r\nthe latter it is, as a source for the study of human evolution, even\r\nsuperior. Its earliest period, being much older than any product\r\nof Greek literature, presents a more primitive form of belief, and\r\ntherefore gives a clearer picture of the development of religious\r\nideas than any other literary monument of the world. Hence it came\r\nabout that, just as the discovery of the Sanskrit language led to the\r\nfoundation of the science of Comparative Philology, an acquaintance\r\nwith the literature of the Vedas resulted in the foundation of the\r\nscience of Comparative Mythology by Adalbert Kuhn and Max Müller.\r\n\r\nThough it has touched excellence in most of its branches,\r\nSanskrit literature has mainly achieved greatness in religion and\r\nphilosophy. The Indians are the only division of the Indo-European\r\nfamily which has created a great national religion--Brahmanism--and\r\na great world-religion--Buddhism; while all the rest, far from\r\ndisplaying originality in this sphere, have long since adopted a\r\nforeign faith. The intellectual life of the Indians has, in fact, all\r\nalong been more dominated by religious thought than that of any other\r\nrace. The Indians, moreover, developed independently several systems\r\nof philosophy which bear evidence of high speculative powers. The\r\ngreat interest, however, which these two subjects must have for us\r\nlies, not so much in the results they attained, as in the fact that\r\nevery step in the evolution of religion and philosophy can be traced\r\nin Sanskrit literature.\r\n\r\nThe importance of ancient Indian literature as a whole largely consists\r\nin its originality. Naturally isolated by its gigantic mountain barrier\r\nin the north, the Indian peninsula has ever since the Aryan invasion\r\nformed a world apart, over which a unique form of Aryan civilisation\r\nrapidly spread, and has ever since prevailed. When the Greeks,\r\ntowards the end of the fourth century B.C., invaded the North-West, the\r\nIndians had already fully worked out a national culture of their own,\r\nunaffected by foreign influences. And, in spite of successive waves\r\nof invasion and conquest by Persians, Greeks, Scythians, Muhammadans,\r\nthe national development of the life and literature of the Indo-Aryan\r\nrace remained practically unchecked and unmodified from without down to\r\nthe era of British occupation. No other branch of the Indo-European\r\nstock has experienced an isolated evolution like this. No other\r\ncountry except China can trace back its language and literature,\r\nits religious beliefs and rites, its domestic and social customs,\r\nthrough an uninterrupted development of more than three thousand years.\r\n\r\nA few examples will serve to illustrate this remarkable continuity\r\nin Indian civilisation. Sanskrit is still spoken as the tongue of\r\nthe learned by thousands of Brahmans, as it was centuries before\r\nour era. Nor has it ceased to be used for literary purposes, for\r\nmany books and journals written in the ancient language are still\r\nproduced. The copying of Sanskrit manuscripts is still continued in\r\nhundreds of libraries in India, uninterrupted even by the introduction\r\nof printing during the present century. The Vedas are still learnt\r\nby heart as they were long before the invasion of Alexander, and\r\ncould even now be restored from the lips of religious teachers if\r\nevery manuscript or printed copy of them were destroyed. A Vedic\r\nstanza of immemorial antiquity, addressed to the sun-god Savitri,\r\nis still recited in the daily worship of the Hindus. The god Vishnu,\r\nadored more than 3000 years ago, has countless votaries in India at\r\nthe present day. Fire is still produced for sacrificial purposes by\r\nmeans of two sticks, as it was in ages even more remote. The wedding\r\nceremony of the modern Hindu, to single out but one social custom,\r\nis essentially the same as it was long before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe history of ancient Indian literature naturally falls into two\r\nmain periods. The first is the Vedic, which beginning perhaps as\r\nearly as 1500 B.C., extends in its latest phase to about 200 B.C. In\r\nthe former half of the Vedic age the character of its literature\r\nwas creative and poetical, while the centre of culture lay in the\r\nterritory of the Indus and its tributaries, the modern Panjab; in the\r\nlatter half, literature was theologically speculative in matter and\r\nprosaic in form, while the centre of intellectual life had shifted to\r\nthe valley of the Ganges. Thus in the course of the Vedic age Aryan\r\ncivilisation had overspread the whole of Hindustan Proper, the vast\r\ntract extending from the mouths of the Indus to those of the Ganges,\r\nbounded on the north by the Himalaya, and on the south by the Vindhya\r\nrange. The second period, concurrent with the final offshoots of Vedic\r\nliterature and closing with the Muhammadan conquest after 1000 A.D.,\r\nis the Sanskrit period strictly speaking. In a certain sense, owing to\r\nthe continued literary use of Sanskrit, mainly for the composition of\r\ncommentaries, this period may be regarded as coming down to the present\r\nday. During this second epoch Brahmanic culture was introduced into and\r\noverspread the southern portion of the continent called the Dekhan or\r\n\"the South.\" In the course of these two periods taken together, Indian\r\nliterature attained noteworthy results in nearly every department. The\r\nVedic age, which, unlike the earlier epoch of Greece, produced only\r\nreligious works, reached a high standard of merit in lyric poetry,\r\nand later made some advance towards the formation of a prose style.\r\n\r\nThe Sanskrit period, embracing in general secular subjects, achieved\r\ndistinction in many branches of literature, in national as well as\r\ncourt epic, in lyric and especially didactic poetry, in the drama,\r\nin fairy tales, fables, and romances. Everywhere we find much\r\ntrue poetry, the beauty of which is, however, marred by obscurity\r\nof style and the ever-increasing taint of artificiality. But this\r\nperiod produced few works which, regarded as a whole, are dominated\r\nby a sense of harmony and proportion. Such considerations have had\r\nlittle influence on the æsthetic notions of India. The tendency\r\nhas been rather towards exaggeration, manifesting itself in all\r\ndirections. The almost incredible development of detail in ritual\r\nobservance; the extraordinary excesses of asceticism; the grotesque\r\nrepresentations of mythology in art; the frequent employment of vast\r\nnumbers in description; the immense bulk of the epics; the unparalleled\r\nconciseness of one of the forms of prose; the huge compounds habitually\r\nemployed in the later style, are among the more striking manifestations\r\nof this defect of the Indian mind.\r\n\r\nIn various branches of scientific literature, in phonetics, grammar,\r\nmathematics, astronomy, medicine, and law, the Indians also achieved\r\nnotable results. In some of these subjects their attainments are,\r\nindeed, far in advance of what was accomplished by the Greeks.\r\n\r\nHistory is the one weak spot in Indian literature. It is, in\r\nfact, non-existent. The total lack of the historical sense is so\r\ncharacteristic, that the whole course of Sanskrit literature is\r\ndarkened by the shadow of this defect, suffering as it does from an\r\nentire absence of exact chronology. So true is this, that the very\r\ndate of Kalidasa, the greatest of Indian poets, was long a matter of\r\ncontroversy within the limits of a thousand years, and is even now\r\ndoubtful to the extent of a century or two. Thus the dates of Sanskrit\r\nauthors are in the vast majority of cases only known approximately,\r\nhaving been inferred from the indirect evidence of interdependence,\r\nquotation or allusion, development of language or style. As to the\r\nevents of their lives, we usually know nothing at all, and only in a\r\nfew cases one or two general facts. Two causes seem to have combined\r\nto bring about this remarkable result. In the first place, early India\r\nwrote no history because it never made any. The ancient Indians never\r\nwent through a struggle for life, like the Greeks in the Persian\r\nand the Romans in the Punic wars, such as would have welded their\r\ntribes into a nation and developed political greatness. Secondly,\r\nthe Brahmans, whose task it would naturally have been to record\r\ngreat deeds, had early embraced the doctrine that all action and\r\nexistence are a positive evil, and could therefore have felt but\r\nlittle inclination to chronicle historical events.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, definite dates do not begin to appear in Indian\r\nliterary history till about 500 A.D. The chronology of the Vedic\r\nperiod is altogether conjectural, being based entirely on internal\r\nevidence. Three main literary strata can be clearly distinguished\r\nin it by differences in language and style, as well as in religious\r\nand social views. For the development of each of these strata a\r\nreasonable length of time must be allowed; but all we can here hope\r\nto do is to approximate to the truth by centuries. The lower limit\r\nof the second Vedic stratum cannot, however, be fixed later than\r\n500 B.C., because its latest doctrines are presupposed by Buddhism,\r\nand the date of the death of Buddha has been with a high degree\r\nof probability calculated, from the recorded dates of the various\r\nBuddhist councils, to be 480 B.C. With regard to the commencement of\r\nthe Vedic age, there seems to have been a decided tendency among\r\nSanskrit scholars to place it too high. 2000 B.C. is commonly\r\nrepresented as its starting-point. Supposing this to be correct,\r\nthe truly vast period of 1500 years is required to account for a\r\ndevelopment of language and thought hardly greater than that between\r\nthe Homeric and the Attic age of Greece. Professor Max Müller's\r\nearlier estimate of 1200 B.C., formed forty years ago, appears to be\r\nmuch nearer the mark. A lapse of three centuries, say from 1300-1000\r\nB.C., would amply account for the difference between what is oldest\r\nand newest in Vedic hymn poetry. Considering that the affinity of\r\nthe oldest form of the Avestan language with the dialect of the Vedas\r\nis already so great that, by the mere application of phonetic laws,\r\nwhole Avestan stanzas may be translated word for word into Vedic, so\r\nas to produce verses correct not only in form but in poetic spirit;\r\nconsidering further, that if we knew the Avestan language at as early\r\na stage as we know the Vedic, the former would necessarily be almost\r\nidentical with the latter, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion\r\nthat the Indian branch must have separated from the Iranian only a\r\nvery short time before the beginnings of Vedic literature, and can\r\ntherefore have hardly entered the North-West of India even as early as\r\n1500 B.C. All previous estimates of the antiquity of the Vedic period\r\nhave been outdone by the recent theory of Professor Jacobi of Bonn,\r\nwho supposes that period goes back to at least 4000 B.C. This theory\r\nis based on astronomical calculations connected with a change in the\r\nbeginning of the seasons, which Professor Jacobi thinks has taken\r\nplace since the time of the Rigveda. The whole estimate is, however,\r\ninvalidated by the assumption of a doubtful, and even improbable,\r\nmeaning in a Vedic word, which forms the very starting-point of the\r\ntheory. Meanwhile we must rest content with the certainty that Vedic\r\nliterature in any case is of considerably higher antiquity than that\r\nof Greece.\r\n\r\nFor the post-Vedic period we have, in addition to the results of\r\ninternal evidence, a few landmarks of general chronological importance\r\nin the visits of foreigners. The earliest date of this kind is that of\r\nthe invasion of India by Alexander in 326 B.C. This was followed by\r\nthe sojourn in India of various Greeks, of whom the most notable was\r\nMegasthenes. He resided for some years about 300 B.C. at the court\r\nof Pataliputra (the modern Patna), and has left a valuable though\r\nfragmentary account of the contemporary state of Indian society. Many\r\ncenturies later India was visited by three Chinese Buddhist pilgrims,\r\nFa Hian (399 A.D.), Hiouen Thsang (630-645), and I Tsing (671-695). The\r\nrecords of their travels, which have been preserved, and are all now\r\ntranslated into English, shed much light on the social conditions,\r\nthe religious thought, and the Buddhist antiquities of India in\r\ntheir day. Some general and specific facts about Indian literature\r\nalso can be gathered from them. Hiouen Thsang especially supplies\r\nsome important statements about contemporary Sanskrit poets. It is\r\nnot till his time that we can say of any Sanskrit writer that he\r\nwas alive in any particular year, excepting only the three Indian\r\nastronomers, whose exact dates in the fifth and sixth centuries have\r\nbeen recorded by themselves. It was only the information supplied\r\nby the two earlier Chinese writers that made possible the greatest\r\narchæological discovery of the present century in India, that of the\r\nsite of Buddha's birthplace, Kapila-vastu, identified in December\r\n1896. At the close of our period we have the very valuable account\r\nof the country at the time of the Muhammadan conquest by the Arabic\r\nauthor Alberuni, who wrote his India in 1030 A.D.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from what has been said, that before 500 A.D. literary\r\nchronology, even in the Sanskrit period, is almost entirely relative,\r\npriority or posteriority being determined by such criteria as\r\ndevelopment of style or thought, the mention of earlier authors\r\nby name, stray political references as to the Greeks or to some\r\nwell-known dynasty, and allusions to astronomical facts which cannot\r\nhave been known before a certain epoch. Recent research, owing to\r\nincreased specialisation, has made considerable progress towards\r\ngreater chronological definiteness. More light will doubtless in\r\ncourse of time come from the political history of early India,\r\nwhich is being reconstructed, with great industry and ability,\r\nby various distinguished scholars from the evidence of coins,\r\ncopper-plate grants, and rock or pillar inscriptions. These have\r\nbeen or are being published in the Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum,\r\nthe Epigraphia Indica, and various journals devoted to the study of\r\nIndian antiquities. The rise in the study of epigraphy during the last\r\ntwenty years has, indeed, already yielded some direct information\r\nof importance about the literary and religious history of India,\r\nby fixing the date of some of the later poets as well as by throwing\r\nlight on religious systems and whole classes of literature. Thus some\r\nmetrical inscriptions of considerable length have been deciphered,\r\nwhich prove the existence of court poetry in Sanskrit and vernacular\r\ndialects from the first century of our era onwards. No direct evidence\r\nof this fact had previously been known.\r\n\r\nThe older inscriptions are also important in connection with Sanskrit\r\nliterature as illustrating both the early history of Indian writing\r\nand the state of the language at the time. The oldest of them are\r\nthe rock and pillar inscriptions, dating from the middle of the\r\nthird century B.C., of the great Buddhist king Açoka, who ruled\r\nover Northern India from 259 to 222 B.C., and during whose reign was\r\nheld the third Buddhist council, at which the canon of the Buddhist\r\nscriptures was probably fixed. The importance of these inscriptions can\r\nhardly be over-rated for the value of the information to be derived\r\nfrom them about the political, religious, and linguistic conditions\r\nof the age. Found scattered all over India, from Girnar (Giri-nagara)\r\nin Kathiawar to Dhauli in Orissa, from Kapur-di-Giri, north of the\r\nKabul river, to Khalsi, they have been reproduced, deciphered, and\r\ntranslated. One of them, engraved on a pillar erected by Açoka to\r\ncommemorate the actual birthplace of Buddha, was discovered only at\r\nthe close of 1896.\r\n\r\nThese Açoka inscriptions are the earliest records of Indian\r\nwriting. The question of the origin and age of writing in India,\r\nlong involved in doubt and controversy, has been greatly cleared up\r\nby the recent palæographical researches of Professor Bühler. That\r\ngreat scholar has shown, that of the two kinds of script known in\r\nancient India, the one called Kharoshthi employed in the country of\r\nGandhara (Eastern Afghanistan and Northern Panjab) from the fourth\r\ncentury B.C. to 200 A.D., was borrowed from the Aramaic type of Semitic\r\nwriting in use during the fifth century B.C. It was always written from\r\nright to left, like its original. The other ancient Indian script,\r\ncalled Brahmi, is, as Bühler shows, the true national writing of\r\nIndia, because all later Indian alphabets are descended from it,\r\nhowever dissimilar many of them may appear at the present day. It\r\nwas regularly written from left to right; but that this was not its\r\noriginal direction is indicated by a coin of the fourth century B.C.,\r\nthe inscription on which runs from right to left. Dr. Bühler has shown\r\nthat this writing is based on the oldest Northern Semitic or Phoenician\r\ntype, represented on Assyrian weights and on the Moabite stone,\r\nwhich dates from about 890 B.C. He argues, with much probability,\r\nthat it was introduced about 800 B.C. into India by traders coming\r\nby way of Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\nReferences to writing in ancient Indian literature are, it is\r\ntrue, very rare and late; in no case, perhaps, earlier than\r\nthe fourth century B.C., or not very long before the date of the\r\nAçoka inscriptions. Little weight, however, can be attached to the\r\nargumentum ex silentio in this instance. For though writing has now\r\nbeen extensively in use for an immense period, the native learning\r\nof the modern Indian is still based on oral tradition. The sacred\r\nscriptures as well as the sciences can only be acquired from the lips\r\nof a teacher, not from a manuscript; and as only memorial knowledge\r\nis accounted of value, writing and MSS. are rarely mentioned. Even\r\nmodern poets do not wish to be read, but cherish the hope that their\r\nworks may be recited. This immemorial practice, indeed, shows that the\r\nbeginnings of Indian poetry and science go back to a time when writing\r\nwas unknown, and a system of oral tradition, such as is referred\r\nto in the Rigveda, was developed before writing was introduced. The\r\nlatter could, therefore, have been in use long before it began to be\r\nmentioned. The palæographical evidence of the Açoka inscriptions,\r\nin any case, clearly shows that writing was no recent invention\r\nin the third century B.C., for most of the letters have several,\r\noften very divergent forms, sometimes as many as nine or ten. A\r\nconsiderable length of time was, moreover, needed to elaborate from\r\nthe twenty-two borrowed Semitic symbols the full Brahmi alphabet of\r\nforty-six letters. This complete alphabet, which was evidently worked\r\nout by learned Brahmans on phonetic principles, must have existed\r\nby 500 B.C., according to the strong arguments adduced by Professor\r\nBühler. This is the alphabet which is recognised in Pannini's great\r\nSanskrit grammar of about the fourth century B.C., and has remained\r\nunmodified ever since. It not only represents all the sounds of the\r\nSanskrit language, but is arranged on a thoroughly scientific method,\r\nthe simple vowels (short and long) coming first, then the diphthongs,\r\nand lastly the consonants in uniform groups according to the organs\r\nof speech with which they are pronounced. Thus the dental consonants\r\nappear together as t, th, d, dh, n, and the labials as p, ph, b,\r\nbh, m. We Europeans, on the other hand, 2500 years later, and in a\r\nscientific age, still employ an alphabet which is not only inadequate\r\nto represent all the sounds of our languages, but even preserves the\r\nrandom order in which vowels and consonants are jumbled up as they\r\nwere in the Greek adaptation of the primitive Semitic arrangement of\r\n3000 years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the inscriptions of the third century B.C. two types, the Northern\r\nand the Southern, may be distinguished in the Brahmi writing. From\r\nthe former is descended the group of Northern scripts which gradually\r\nprevailed in all the Aryan dialects of India. The most important\r\nof them is the Nagari (also called Devanagari), in which Sanskrit\r\nMSS. are usually written, and Sanskrit as well as Marathi and Hindi\r\nbooks are regularly printed. It is recognisable by the characteristic\r\nhorizontal line at the top of the letters. The oldest inscription\r\nengraved entirely in Nagari belongs to the eighth, and the oldest\r\nMS. written in it to the eleventh century. From the Southern variety\r\nof the Brahmi writing are descended five types of script, all in use\r\nsouth of the Vindhya range. Among them are the characters employed\r\nin the Canarese and the Telugu country.\r\n\r\nOwing to the perishability of the material on which they are written,\r\nSanskrit MSS. older than the fourteenth century A.D. are rare. The two\r\nancient materials used in India were strips of birch bark and palm\r\nleaves. The employment of the former, beginning in the North-West\r\nof India, where extensive birch forests clothe the slopes of the\r\nHimalaya, gradually spread to Central, Eastern, and Western India. The\r\noldest known Sanskrit MS. written on birch bark dates from the fifth\r\ncentury A.D., and a Pali MS. in Kharoshthi which became known in 1897,\r\nis still older, but the use of this material doubtless goes back to\r\nfar earlier days. Thus we have the statement of Quintus Curtius that\r\nthe Indians employed it for writing on at the time of Alexander. The\r\ntestimony of classical Sanskrit authors, as well as of Alberuni,\r\nshows that leaves of birch bark (bhurja-pattra) were also regularly\r\nused for letter-writing in early mediæval India.\r\n\r\nThe first example of a palm leaf Sanskrit MS. belongs to the sixth\r\ncentury A.D. It is preserved in Japan, but there is a facsimile of\r\nit in the Bodleian Library. According to the Chinese pilgrim Hiouen\r\nThsang, the use of the palm leaf was common all over India in the\r\nseventh century; but that it was known many centuries earlier is\r\nproved by the fact that an inscribed copper-plate, dating from the\r\nfirst century A.D. at the latest, imitates a palm leaf in shape.\r\n\r\nPaper was introduced by the Muhammadan conquest, and has been very\r\nextensively used since that time for the writing of MSS. The oldest\r\nknown example of a paper Sanskrit MS. written in India is one from\r\nGujarat, belonging to the early part of the thirteenth century. In\r\nNorthern India, where ink was employed for writing, palm leaves went\r\nout of use after the introduction of paper. But in the South, where\r\na stilus has always been employed for scratching in the character,\r\npalm leaves are still common for writing both MSS. and letters. The\r\nbirch bark and palm leaf MSS. are held together by a cord drawn\r\nthrough a single hole in the middle, or through two placed some\r\ndistance apart. This explains how the Sanskrit word for \"knot,\"\r\ngrantha, came to acquire the sense of \"book.\"\r\n\r\nLeather or parchment has never been utilised in India for MSS.,\r\nowing to the ritual impurity of animal materials. For inscriptions\r\ncopper-plates were early and frequently employed. They regularly\r\nimitate the shape of either palm leaves or strips of birch bark.\r\n\r\nThe actual use of ink (the oldest Indian name of which is mashi) is\r\nproved for the second century B.C. by an inscription from a Buddhist\r\nrelic mound, and is rendered very probable for the fourth century\r\nB.C. by the statements of Nearchos and Quintus Curtius.\r\n\r\nAll the old palm leaf, birch bark, and paper Sanskrit MSS. have\r\nbeen written with ink and a reed pen, usually called kalama (a term\r\nborrowed from the Greek kalamos). In Southern India, on the other\r\nhand, it has always been the practice to scratch the writing on palm\r\nleaves with a stilus, the characters being subsequently blackened by\r\nsoot or charcoal being rubbed into them.\r\n\r\nSanskrit MSS. of every kind are usually kept between thin strips\r\nof wood with cords wound round them, and wrapped up in coloured,\r\nsometimes embroidered, cloths. They have been, and still are, preserved\r\nin the libraries of temples, monasteries, colleges, the courts of\r\nprinces, as well as private houses. A famous library was owned by\r\nKing Bhoja of Dhar in the eleventh century. That considerable private\r\nlibraries existed in fairly early times is shown by the fact that the\r\nSanskrit author Bana (about 620 A.D.) had in his employment a reader of\r\nmanuscripts. Even at the present day there are many excellent libraries\r\nof Sanskrit MSS. in the possession of Brahmans all over India.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Indian language, like the literature composed in it, falls\r\ninto the two main divisions of Vedic and Sanskrit. The former differs\r\nfrom the latter on the whole about as much as Homeric from classical\r\nGreek, or the Latin of the Salic hymns from that of Varro. Within the\r\nVedic language, in which the sacred literature of India is written,\r\nseveral stages can be distinguished. In its transitions from one to\r\nthe other it gradually grows more modern till it is ultimately merged\r\nin Sanskrit. Even in its earliest phase Vedic cannot be regarded as a\r\npopular tongue, but is rather an artificially archaic dialect, handed\r\ndown from one generation to the other within the class of priestly\r\nsingers. Of this the language itself supplies several indications. One\r\nof them is the employment side by side of forms belonging to different\r\nlinguistic periods, a practice in which, however, the Vedic does not\r\ngo so far as the Homeric dialect. The spoken language of the Vedic\r\npriests probably differed from this dialect of the hymns only in the\r\nabsence of poetical constructions and archaisms. There was, in fact,\r\neven in the earlier Vedic age, a caste language, such as is to be\r\nfound more or less wherever a literature has grown up; but in India\r\nit has been more strongly marked than in any other country.\r\n\r\nIf, however, Vedic was no longer a natural tongue, but was already\r\nthe scholastic dialect of a class, how much truer is this of the\r\nlanguage of the later literature! Sanskrit differs from Vedic, but\r\nnot in conformity with the natural development which appears in living\r\nlanguages. The phonetic condition of Sanskrit remains almost exactly\r\nthe same as that of the earliest Vedic. In the matter of grammatical\r\nforms, too, the language shows itself to be almost stationary; for\r\nhardly any new formations or inflexions have made their appearance. Yet\r\neven from a grammatical point of view the later language has become\r\nvery different from the earlier. This change was therefore brought\r\nabout, not by new creations, but by successive losses. The most\r\nnotable of these were the disappearance of the subjunctive mood and the\r\nreduction of a dozen infinitives to a single one. In declension the\r\nchange consisted chiefly in the dropping of a number of synonymous\r\nby-forms. It is probable that the spoken Vedic, more modern and\r\nless complex than that of the hymns, to some extent affected the\r\nlater literary language in the direction of simplification. But the\r\nchanges in the language were mainly due to the regulating efforts of\r\nthe grammarians, which were more powerful in India than anywhere else,\r\nowing to the early and exceptional development of grammatical studies\r\nin that country. Their influence alone can explain the elaborate nature\r\nof the phonetic combinations (called Sandhi) between the finals and\r\ninitials of words in the Sanskrit sentence.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the vocabulary of the language that has undergone\r\nthe greatest modifications, as is indeed the case in all literary\r\ndialects; for it is beyond the power of grammarians to control\r\nchange in this direction. Thus we find that the vocabulary has been\r\ngreatly extended by derivation and composition according to recognised\r\ntypes. At the same time there are numerous words which, though old,\r\nseem to be new only because they happen by accident not to occur\r\nin the Vedic literature. Many really new words have, however, come\r\nin through continual borrowings from a lower stratum of language,\r\nwhile already existing words have undergone great changes of meaning.\r\n\r\nThis later phase of the ancient language of India was stereotyped by\r\nthe great grammarian Panini towards the end of the fourth century\r\nB.C. It came to be called Sanskrit, the \"refined\" or \"elaborate\"\r\n(sam-skri-ta, literally \"put together\"), a term not found in the older\r\ngrammarians, but occurring in the earliest epic, the Ramayana. The\r\nname is meant to be opposed to that of the popular dialects called\r\nPrakrita, and is so opposed, for instance, in the Kavyadarça,\r\nor Mirror of Poetry, a work of the sixth century A.D. The older\r\ngrammarians themselves, from Yaska (fifth century B.C.) onwards,\r\nspeak of this classical dialect as Bhasha, \"the speech,\" in\r\ndistinction from Vedic. The remarks they make about it point to\r\na spoken language. Thus one of them, Patanjali, refers to it as\r\nused \"in the world,\" and designates the words of his Sanskrit as\r\n\"current in the world.\" Panini himself gives many rules which have\r\nno significance except in connection with living speech; as when\r\nhe describes the accent or the lengthening of vowels in calling\r\nfrom a distance, in salutation, or in question and answer. Again,\r\nSanskrit cannot have been a mere literary and school language, because\r\nthere are early traces of its having had dialectic variations. Thus\r\nYaska and Panini mention the peculiarities of the \"Easterns\" and\r\n\"Northerners,\" Katyayana refers to local divergences, and Patanjali\r\nspecifies words occurring in single districts only. There is, indeed,\r\nno doubt that in the second century B.C. Sanskrit was actually\r\nspoken in the whole country called by Sanskrit writers Aryavarta, or\r\n\"Land of the Aryans,\" which lies between the Himalaya and the Vindhya\r\nrange. But who spoke it there? Brahmans certainly did; for Patanjali\r\nspeaks of them as the \"instructed\" (çishta), the employers of correct\r\nspeech. Its use, however, extended beyond the Brahmans; for we read\r\nin Patanjali about a head-groom disputing with a grammarian as to\r\nthe etymology of the Sanskrit word for \"charioteer\" (suta). This\r\nagrees with the distribution of the dialects in the Indian drama, a\r\ndistribution doubtless based on a tradition much older than the plays\r\nthemselves. Here the king and those of superior rank speak Sanskrit,\r\nwhile the various forms of the popular dialect are assigned to women\r\nand to men of the people. The dramas also show that whoever did\r\nnot speak Sanskrit at any rate understood it, for Sanskrit is there\r\nemployed in conversation with speakers of Prakrit. The theatrical\r\npublic, and that before which, as we know from frequent references\r\nin the literature, the epics were recited, must also have understood\r\nSanskrit. Thus, though classical Sanskrit was from the beginning a\r\nliterary and, in a sense, an artificial dialect, it would be erroneous\r\nto deny to it altogether the character of a colloquial language. It\r\nis indeed, as has already been mentioned, even now actually spoken in\r\nIndia by learned Brahmans, as well as written by them, for every-day\r\npurposes. The position of Sanskrit, in short, has all along been,\r\nand still is, much like that of Hebrew among the Jews or of Latin in\r\nthe Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nWhoever was familiar with Sanskrit at the same time spoke one popular\r\nlanguage or more. The question as to what these popular languages\r\nwere brings us to the relation of Sanskrit to the vernaculars of\r\nIndia. The linguistic importance of the ancient literary speech for\r\nthe India of to-day will become apparent when it is pointed out that\r\nall the modern dialects--excepting those of a few isolated aboriginal\r\nhill tribes--spoken over the whole vast territory between the mouths\r\nof the Indus and those of the Ganges, between the Himalaya and the\r\nVindhya range, besides the Bombay Presidency as far south as the\r\nPortuguese settlement of Goa, are descended from the oldest form\r\nof Sanskrit. Starting from their ancient source in the north-west,\r\nthey have overflowed in more and more diverging streams the whole\r\npeninsula except the extreme south-east. The beginnings of these\r\npopular dialects go back to a period of great antiquity. Even at the\r\ntime when the Vedic hymns were composed, there must have existed a\r\npopular language which already differed widely in its phonetic aspect\r\nfrom the literary dialect. For the Vedic hymns contain several words\r\nof a phonetic type which can only be explained by borrowings on the\r\npart of their composers from popular speech.\r\n\r\nWe further know that in the sixth century B.C., Buddha preached\r\nhis gospel in the language of the people, as opposed to that of the\r\nlearned, in order that all might understand him. Thus all the oldest\r\nBuddhist literature dating from the fourth or fifth century B.C. was\r\ncomposed in the vernacular, originally doubtless in the dialect of\r\nMagadha (the modern Behar), the birthplace of Buddhism. Like Italian,\r\nas compared with Latin, this early popular speech is characterised\r\nby the avoidance of conjunct consonants and by fondness for final\r\nvowels. Thus the Sanskrit sutra, \"thread,\" and dharma, \"duty,\"\r\nbecome sutta and dhamma respectively, while vidyut, \"lightning,\" is\r\ntransformed into vijju. The particular form of the popular language\r\nwhich became the sacred idiom of Southern Buddhism is known by the\r\nname of Pali. Its original home is still uncertain, but its existence\r\nas early as the third century B.C. is proved beyond the range of doubt\r\nby the numerous rock and pillar inscriptions of Açoka. This dialect was\r\nin the third century B.C. introduced into Ceylon, and became the basis\r\nof Singhalese, the modern language of the island. It was through the\r\ninfluence of Buddhism that, from Açoka's time onwards, the official\r\ndecrees and documents preserved in inscriptions were for centuries\r\ncomposed exclusively in Middle Indian (Prakrit) dialects. Sanskrit\r\nwas not familiar to the chanceries during these centuries, though the\r\nintroduction of Sanskrit verses in Prakrit inscriptions shows that\r\nSanskrit was alive during this period, and proves its continuity for\r\nliterary purposes. The older tradition of both the Buddhist and the\r\nJain religion, in fact, ignored Sanskrit entirely, using only the\r\npopular dialects for all purposes.\r\n\r\nBut in course of time both the Buddhists and the Jains endeavoured to\r\nacquire a knowledge of Sanskrit. This led to the formation of an idiom\r\nwhich, being in the main Prakrit, was made to resemble the old language\r\nby receiving Sanskrit endings and undergoing other adaptations. It\r\nis therefore decidedly wrong to consider this artificial dialect an\r\nintermediate stage between Sanskrit and Pali. This peculiar type of\r\nlanguage is most pronounced in the poetical pieces called gatha or\r\n\"song,\" which occur in the canonical works of the Northern Buddhists,\r\nespecially in the Lalita-vistara, a life of Buddha. Hence it was\r\nformerly called the Gatha dialect. The term is, however, inaccurate,\r\nas Buddhist prose works have also been written in this mixed language.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the inscriptions is instructive in showing the\r\ngradual encroachment of Sanskrit on the popular dialects used by\r\nthe two non-Brahmanical religions. Thus in the Jain inscriptions of\r\nMathura (now Muttra), an almost pure Prakrit prevails down to the first\r\ncentury A.D. After that Sanskritisms become more and more frequent,\r\ntill at last simple Sanskrit is written. Similarly in Buddhist\r\ninscriptions pure Prakrit is relieved by the mixed dialect, the latter\r\nby Sanskrit. Thus in the inscriptions of Nasik, in Western India,\r\nthe mixed dialect extends into the third, while Sanskrit first begins\r\nin the second century A.D. From the sixth century onwards Sanskrit\r\nprevails exclusively (except among the Jains) in inscriptions, though\r\nPrakritisms often occur in them. Even in the literature of Buddhism\r\nthe mixed dialect was gradually supplanted by Sanskrit. Hence most of\r\nthe Northern Buddhist texts have come down to us in Sanskrit, which,\r\nhowever, diverges widely in vocabulary from that of the sacred texts\r\nof the Brahmans, as well as from that of the classical literature,\r\nsince they are full of Prakrit words. It is expressly attested by\r\nthe Chinese pilgrim, Hiouen Thsang, that in the seventh century the\r\nBuddhists used Sanskrit even in oral theological discussions. The Jains\r\nfinally did the same, though without entirely giving up Prakrit. Thus\r\nby the time of the Muhammadan conquest Sanskrit was almost the only\r\nwritten language of India. But while Sanskrit was recovering its\r\nancient supremacy, the Prakrits had exercised a lasting influence upon\r\nit in two respects. They had supplied its vocabulary with a number of\r\nnew words, and had transformed into a stress accent the old musical\r\naccent which still prevailed after the days of Panini.\r\n\r\nIn the oldest period of Prakrit, that of the Pali Açoka inscriptions\r\nand the early Buddhistic and Jain literature, two main dialects, the\r\nWestern and the Eastern, may be distinguished. Between the beginning\r\nof our era and about 1000 A.D., mediæval Prakrit, which is still\r\nsynthetic in character, is divided into four chief dialects. In the\r\nwest we find Apabhramça (\"decadent\") in the valley of the Indus,\r\nand Çauraseni in the Doab, with Mathura as its centre. Subdivisions\r\nof the latter were Gaurjari (Gujarati), Avanti (Western Rajputani),\r\nand Maharashtri (Eastern Rajputani). The Eastern Prakrit now appears\r\nas Magadhi, the dialect of Magadha, now Behar, and Ardha-Magadhi\r\n(Half-Magadhi), with Benares as its centre. These mediæval Prakrits\r\nare important in connection with Sanskrit literature, as they are the\r\nvernaculars employed by the uneducated classes in the Sanskrit drama.\r\n\r\nThey are the sources of all the Aryan languages of modern India. From\r\nthe Apabhramça are derived Sindhi, Western Panjabi, and Kashmiri;\r\nfrom Çauraseni come Eastern Panjabi and Hindi (the old Avanti), as\r\nwell as Gujarati; while from the two forms of Magadhi are descended\r\nMarathi on the one hand, and the various dialects of Bengal on the\r\nother. These modern vernaculars, which began to develop from about\r\n1000 A.D., are no longer inflexional languages, but are analytical\r\nlike English, forming an interesting parallel in their development\r\nfrom ancient Sanskrit to the Romance dialects in their derivation\r\nfrom Latin. They have developed literatures of their own, which are\r\nbased entirely on that of Sanskrit. The non-Aryan languages of the\r\nDekhan, the Dravidian group, including Telugu, Canarese, Malayalam,\r\nand Tamil, have not indeed been ousted by Aryan tongues, but they\r\nare full of words borrowed from Sanskrit, while their literature is\r\ndominated by Sanskrit models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE VEDIC PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the very threshold of Indian literature more than three thousand\r\nyears ago, we are confronted with a body of lyrical poetry which,\r\nalthough far older than the literary monuments of any other branch of\r\nthe Indo-European family, is already distinguished by refinement and\r\nbeauty of thought, as well as by skill in the handling of language\r\nand metre. From this point, for a period of more than a thousand\r\nyears, Indian literature bears an exclusively religious stamp; even\r\nthose latest productions of the Vedic age which cannot be called\r\ndirectly religious are yet meant to further religious ends. This is,\r\nindeed, implied by the term \"Vedic.\" For veda, primarily signifying\r\n\"knowledge\" (from vid, \"to know\"), designates \"sacred lore,\" as a\r\nbranch of literature. Besides this general sense, the word has also\r\nthe restricted meaning of \"sacred book.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Vedic period three well-defined literary strata are to be\r\ndistinguished. The first is that of the four Vedas, the outcome of\r\na creative and poetic age, in which hymns and prayers were composed\r\nchiefly to accompany the pressing and offering of the Soma juice or\r\nthe oblation of melted butter (ghrita) to the gods. The four Vedas are\r\n\"collections,\" called samhita, of hymns and prayers made for different\r\nritual purposes. They are of varying age and significance. By far the\r\nmost important as well as the oldest--for it is the very foundation of\r\nall Vedic literature--is the Rigveda, the \"Veda of verses\" (from rich,\r\n\"a laudatory stanza\"), consisting entirely of lyrics, mainly in praise\r\nof different gods. It may, therefore, be described as the book of\r\nhymns or psalms. The Sama-veda has practically no independent value,\r\nfor it consists entirely of stanzas (excepting only 75) taken from\r\nthe Rigveda and arranged solely with reference to their place in the\r\nSoma sacrifice. Being meant to be sung to certain fixed melodies,\r\nit may be called the book of chants (saman). The Yajur-veda differs\r\nin one essential respect from the Sama-veda, It consists not only of\r\nstanzas (rich), mostly borrowed from the Rigveda, but also of original\r\nprose formulas. It resembles the Sama-veda, however, in having its\r\ncontents arranged in the order in which it was actually employed in\r\nvarious sacrifices. It is, therefore, a book of sacrificial prayers\r\n(yajus). The matter of this Veda has been handed down in two forms. In\r\nthe one, the sacrificial formulas only are given; in the other, these\r\nare to a certain extent intermingled with their explanations. These\r\nthree Vedas alone were at first recognised as canonical scriptures,\r\nbeing in the next stage of Vedic literature comprehensively spoken\r\nof as \"the threefold knowledge\" (trayi vidya).\r\n\r\nThe fourth collection, the Atharva-veda, attained to this position only\r\nafter a long struggle. Judged both by its language and by that portion\r\nof its matter which is analogous to the contents of the Rigveda,\r\nthe Atharva-veda came into existence considerably later than that\r\nVeda. In form it is similar to the Rigveda, consisting for the most\r\npart of metrical hymns, many of which are taken from the last book\r\nof the older collection. In spirit, however, it is not only entirely\r\ndifferent from the Rigveda, but represents a much more primitive\r\nstage of thought. While the Rigveda deals almost exclusively with\r\nthe higher gods as conceived by a comparatively advanced and refined\r\nsacerdotal class, the Atharva-veda is, in the main, a book of spells\r\nand incantations appealing to the demon world, and teems with notions\r\nabout witchcraft current among the lower grades of the population, and\r\nderived from an immemorial antiquity. These two, thus complementary to\r\neach other in contents, are obviously the most important of the four\r\nVedas. As representing religious ideas at an earlier stage than any\r\nother literary monuments of the ancient world, they are of inestimable\r\nvalue to those who study the evolution of religious beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe creative period of the Vedas at length came to an end. It was\r\nfollowed by an epoch in which there no longer seemed any need to\r\noffer up new prayers to the gods, but it appeared more meritorious\r\nto repeat those made by the holy seers of bygone generations, and\r\nhanded down from father to son in various priestly families. The\r\nold hymns thus came to be successively gathered together in the\r\nVedic collections already mentioned and in this form acquired an\r\never-increasing sanctity. Having ceased to produce poetry, the\r\npriesthood transferred their creative energies to the elaboration\r\nof the sacrificial ceremonial. The result was a ritual system far\r\nsurpassing in complexity of detail anything the world has elsewhere\r\nknown. The main importance of the old Vedic hymns and formulas\r\nnow came to be their application to the innumerable details of the\r\nsacrifice. Around this combination of sacred verse and rite a new\r\nbody of doctrine grew up in sacerdotal tradition, and finally assumed\r\ndefinite shape in the guise of distinct theological treatises entitled\r\nBrahmanas, \"books dealing with devotion or prayer\" (brahman). They\r\nevidently did not come into being till a time when the hymns were\r\nalready deemed ancient and sacred revelations, the priestly custodians\r\nof which no longer fully understood their meaning owing to the change\r\nundergone by the language. They are written in prose throughout, and\r\nare in some cases accented, like the Vedas themselves. They are thus\r\nnotable as representing the oldest prose writing of the Indo-European\r\nfamily. Their style is, indeed, cumbrous, rambling, and disjointed,\r\nbut distinct progress towards greater facility is observable within\r\nthis literary period.\r\n\r\nThe chief purpose of the Brahmanas is to explain the mutual relation of\r\nthe sacred text and the ceremonial, as well as their symbolical meaning\r\nwith reference to each other. With the exception of the occasional\r\nlegends and striking thoughts which occur in them, they cannot be\r\nsaid to be at all attractive as literary productions. To support\r\ntheir explanations of the ceremonial, they interweave exegetical,\r\nlinguistic, and etymological observations, and introduce myths and\r\nphilosophical speculations in confirmation of their cosmogonic and\r\ntheosophic theories. They form an aggregate of shallow and pedantic\r\ndiscussions, full of sacerdotal conceits, and fanciful, or even absurd,\r\nidentifications, such as is doubtless unparalleled anywhere else. Yet,\r\nas the oldest treatises on ritual practices extant in any literature,\r\nthey are of great interest to the student of the history of religions\r\nin general, besides furnishing much important material to the student\r\nof Indian antiquity in particular.\r\n\r\nIt results from what has been said that the contrasts between the two\r\nolder phases of Vedic literature are strongly marked. The Vedas are\r\npoetical in matter and form; the Brahmanas are prosaic and written in\r\nprose. The thought of the Vedas is on the whole natural and concrete;\r\nthat of the Brahmanas artificial and abstract. The chief significance\r\nof the Vedas lies in their mythology; that of the Brahmanas in\r\ntheir ritual.\r\n\r\nThe subject-matter of the Brahmanas which are attached to the various\r\nVedas, differs according to the divergent duties performed by the kind\r\nof priest connected with each Veda. The Brahmanas of the Rigveda,\r\nin explaining the ritual, usually limit themselves to the duties\r\nof the priest called hotri or \"reciter\" on whom it was incumbent to\r\nform the canon (çastra) for each particular rite, by selecting from\r\nthe hymns the verses applicable to it. The Brahmanas of the Sama-veda\r\nare concerned only with the duties of the udgatri or \"chanter\" of the\r\nSamans; the Brahmanas of the Yajur-veda with those of the adhvaryu,\r\nor the priest who is the actual sacrificer. Again, the Brahmanas\r\nof the Rigveda more or less follow the order of the ritual, quite\r\nirrespectively of the succession of the hymns in the Veda itself. The\r\nBrahmanas of the Sama- and the Yajur-veda, on the other hand, follow\r\nthe order of their respective Vedas, which are already arranged in\r\nthe ritual sequence. The Brahmana of the Sama-veda, however, rarely\r\nexplains individual verses, while that of the Yajur-veda practically\r\nforms a running commentary on all the verses of the text.\r\n\r\nThe period of the Brahmanas is a very important one in the history\r\nof Indian society. For in it the system of the four castes assumed\r\ndefinite shape, furnishing the frame within which the highly complex\r\nnetwork of the castes of to-day has been developed. In that system\r\nthe priesthood, who even in the first Vedic period had occupied an\r\ninfluential position, secured for themselves the dominant power which\r\nthey have maintained ever since. The life of no other people has been\r\nso saturated with sacerdotal influence as that of the Hindus, among\r\nwhom sacred learning is still the monopoly of the hereditary priestly\r\ncaste. While in other early societies the chief power remained in the\r\nhands of princes and warrior nobles, the domination of the priesthood\r\nbecame possible in India as soon as the energetic life of conquest\r\nduring the early Vedic times in the north-west was followed by a\r\nperiod of physical inactivity or indolence in the plains. Such altered\r\nconditions enabled the cultured class, who alone held the secret of\r\nthe all-powerful sacrifice, to gain the supremacy of intellect over\r\nphysical force.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmanas in course of time themselves acquired a sacred\r\ncharacter, and came in the following period to be classed along with\r\nthe hymns as çruti or \"hearing,\" that which was directly heard by or,\r\nas we should say, revealed to, the holy sages of old. In the sphere\r\nof revelation are included the later portions of the Brahmanas,\r\nwhich form treatises of a specially theosophic character, and being\r\nmeant to be imparted or studied in the solitude of the forest, are\r\ncalled Aranyakas or \"Forest-books.\" The final part of these, again,\r\nare philosophical books named Upanishads, which belong to the latest\r\nstage of Brahmana literature. The pantheistic groundwork of their\r\ndoctrine was later developed into the Vedanta system, which is still\r\nthe favourite philosophy of the modern Hindus.\r\n\r\nWorks of Vedic \"revelation\" were deemed of higher authority in cases\r\nof doubt than the later works on religious and civil usage, called\r\nsmriti or \"memory,\" as embodying only the tradition derived from\r\nancient sages.\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the third and last stage of Vedic literature,\r\nthat of the Sutras. These are compendious treatises dealing with Vedic\r\nritual on the one hand, and with customary law on the other. The rise\r\nof this class of writings was due to the need of reducing the vast\r\nand growing mass of details in ritual and custom, preserved in the\r\nBrahmanas and in floating tradition, to a systematic shape, and of\r\ncompressing them within a compass which did not impose too great a\r\nburden on the memory, the vehicle of all teaching and learning. The\r\nmain object of the Sutras is, therefore, to supply a short survey of\r\nthe sum of these scattered details. They are not concerned with the\r\ninterpretation of ceremonial or custom, but aim at giving a plain and\r\nmethodical account of the whole course of the rites or practices with\r\nwhich they deal. For this purpose the utmost brevity was needed,\r\na requirement which was certainly met in a manner unparalleled\r\nelsewhere. The very name of this class of literature, sutra, \"thread\"\r\nor \"clue\" (from siv, \"to sew\"), points to its main characteristic\r\nand chief object--extreme conciseness. The prose in which these\r\nworks are composed is so compressed that the wording of the most\r\nlaconic telegram would often appear diffuse compared with it. Some\r\nof the Sutras attain to an almost algebraic mode of expression,\r\nthe formulas of which cannot be understood without the help of\r\ndetailed commentaries. A characteristic aphorism has been preserved,\r\nwhich illustrates this straining after brevity. According to it,\r\nthe composers of grammatical Sutras delight as much in the saving of\r\na short vowel as in the birth of a son. The full force of this remark\r\ncan only be understood when it is remembered that a Brahman is deemed\r\nincapable of gaining heaven without a son to perform his funeral rites.\r\n\r\nThough the works comprised in each class of Sutras are essentially the\r\nsame in character, it is natural to suppose that their composition\r\nextended over some length of time, and that those which are more\r\nconcise and precise in their wording are the more recent; for the\r\nevolution of their style is obviously in the direction of increased\r\nsuccinctness. Research, it is true, has hitherto failed to arrive at\r\nany definite result as to the date of their composition. Linguistic\r\ninvestigations, however, tend to show that the Sutras are closely\r\nconnected in time with the grammarian Panini, some of them appearing\r\nto be considerably anterior to him. We shall, therefore, probably not\r\ngo very far wrong in assigning 500 and 200 B.C. as the chronological\r\nlimits within which the Sutra literature was developed.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of the Vedic ritual was handed down in two forms. The\r\none class, called Çrauta Sutras, because based on çruti or revelation\r\n(by which in this case the Brahmanas are chiefly meant), deal with\r\nthe ritual of the greater sacrifices, for the performance of which\r\nthree or more sacred fires, as well as the ministrations of priests,\r\nare necessary. Not one of them presents a complete picture of the\r\nsacrifice, because each of them, like the Brahmanas, describes only\r\nthe duties of one or other of the three kinds of priests attached to\r\nthe respective Vedas. In order to obtain a full description of each\r\nritual ceremony, it is therefore needful to supplement the account\r\ngiven by one Çrauta Sutra from that furnished by the rest.\r\n\r\nThe other division of the ritual Sutras is based on smriti or\r\ntradition. These are the Grihya Sutras, or \"House Aphorisms,\" which\r\ndeal with the household ceremonies, or the rites to be performed\r\nwith the domestic fire in daily life. As a rule, these rites are not\r\nperformed by a priest, but by the householder himself in company\r\nwith his wife. For this reason there is, apart from deviations\r\nin arrangement and expression, omission or addition, no essential\r\ndifference between the various Grihya Sutras, except that the verses to\r\nbe repeated which they contain are taken from the Veda to which they\r\nbelong. Each Grihya Sutra, besides being attached to and referring\r\nto the Çrauta Sutra of the same school, presupposes a knowledge of\r\nit. But though thus connected, the two do not form a unity.\r\n\r\nThe second class of Sutras, which deal with social and legal usage, is,\r\nlike the Grihya Sutras, also based on smriti or tradition. These are\r\nthe Dharma Sutras, which are in general the oldest sources of Indian\r\nlaw. As is implied by the term dharma, \"religion and morality,\" their\r\npoint of view is chiefly a religious one. They are closely connected\r\nwith the Veda, which they quote, and which the later law-books regard\r\nas the first and highest source of dharma.\r\n\r\nFrom the intensely crabbed and unintelligible nature of their style,\r\nand the studied baldness with which they present their subjects,\r\nit is evident that the Sutras are inferior even to the Brahmanas as\r\nliterary productions. Judged, however, with regard to its matter,\r\nthis strange phase of literature has considerable value. In all other\r\nancient literatures knowledge of sacrificial rites can only be gained\r\nby collecting stray references. But in the ritual Sutras we possess\r\nthe ancient manuals which the priests used as the foundation of their\r\nsacrificial lore. Their statements are so systematic and detailed that\r\nit is possible to reconstruct from them various sacrifices without\r\nhaving seen them performed. They are thus of great importance for\r\nthe history of religious institutions. But the Sutras have a further\r\nvalue. For, as the life of the Hindu, more than that of any other\r\nnation, was, even in the Vedic age, surrounded with a network of\r\nreligious forms, both in its daily course and in its more important\r\ndivisions, the domestic ritual as well as the legal Sutras are our\r\nmost important sources for the study of the social conditions of\r\nancient India. They are the oldest Indian records of all that is\r\nincluded under custom.\r\n\r\nBesides these ritual and legal compendia, the Sutra period produced\r\nseveral classes of works composed in this style, which, though not\r\nreligious in character, had a religious origin. They arose from the\r\nstudy of the Vedas, which was prompted by the increasing difficulty of\r\nunderstanding the hymns, and of reciting them correctly, in consequence\r\nof the changes undergone by the language. Their chief object was\r\nto ensure the right recitation and interpretation of the sacred\r\ntext. One of the most important classes of this ancillary literature\r\ncomprises the Pratiçakhya Sutras, which, dealing with accentuation,\r\npronunciation, metre, and other matters, are chiefly concerned with\r\nthe phonetic changes undergone by Vedic words when combined in a\r\nsentence. They contain a number of minute observations, such as have\r\nonly been made over again by the phoneticians of the present day in\r\nEurope. A still more important branch of this subsidiary literature\r\nis grammar, in which the results attained by the Indians in the\r\nsystematic analysis of language surpass those arrived at by any other\r\nnation. Little has been preserved of the earliest attempts in this\r\ndirection, for all that had been previously done was superseded by the\r\ngreat Sutra work of Panini. Though belonging probably to the middle\r\nof the Sutra period, Panini must be regarded as the starting-point of\r\nthe Sanskrit age, the literature of which is almost entirely dominated\r\nby the linguistic standard stereotyped by him.\r\n\r\nIn the Sutra period also arose a class of works specially designed\r\nfor preserving the text of the Vedas from loss or change. These are\r\nthe Anukramanis or \"Indices,\" which quote the first words of each\r\nhymn, its author, the deity celebrated in it, the number of verses\r\nit contains, and the metre in which it is composed. One of them\r\nstates the total number of hymns, verses, words, and even syllables,\r\ncontained in the Rigveda, besides supplying other details.\r\n\r\nFrom this general survey of the Vedic period we now turn to a more\r\ndetailed consideration of the different phases of the literature\r\nit produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE RIGVEDA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the dim twilight preceding the dawn of Indian literature the\r\nhistorical imagination can perceive the forms of Aryan warriors, the\r\nfirst Western conquerors of Hindustan, issuing from those passes in\r\nthe north-west through which the tide of invasion has in successive\r\nages rolled to sweep over the plains of India. The earliest poetry of\r\nthis invading race, whose language and culture ultimately overspread\r\nthe whole continent, was composed while its tribes still occupied\r\nthe territories on both sides of the Indus now known as Eastern\r\nKabulistan and the Panjab. That ancient poetry has come down to us\r\nin the form of a collection of hymns called the Rigveda. The cause\r\nwhich gathered the poems it contains into a single book was not\r\npractical, as in the case of the Sama- and Yajur-veda, but scientific\r\nand historical. For its ancient editors were undoubtedly impelled by\r\nthe motive of guarding this heritage of olden time from change and\r\ndestruction. The number of hymns comprised in the Rigveda, in the\r\nonly recension which has been preserved, that of the Çakala school,\r\nis 1017, or, if the eleven supplementary hymns (called Valakhilya)\r\nwhich are inserted in the middle of the eighth book are added,\r\n1028. These hymns are grouped in ten books, called mandalas, or\r\n\"cycles,\" which vary in length, except that the tenth contains the\r\nsame number of hymns as the first. In bulk the hymns of the Rigveda\r\nequal, it has been calculated, the surviving poems of Homer.\r\n\r\nThe general character of the ten books is not identical in all\r\ncases. Six of them (ii.-vii.) are homogeneous. Each of these, in\r\nthe first place, is the work of a different seer or his descendants\r\naccording to the ancient tradition, which is borne out by internal\r\nevidence. They were doubtless long handed down separately in the\r\nfamilies to which they owed their being. Moreover, the hymns contained\r\nin these \"family books,\" as they are usually called, are arranged on\r\na uniform plan differing from that of the rest. The first, eighth,\r\nand tenth books are not the productions of a single family of seers\r\nrespectively, but consist of a number of groups based on identity of\r\nauthorship. The arrangement of the ninth book is in no way connected\r\nwith its composers; its unity is due to all its hymns being addressed\r\nto the single deity Soma, while its groups depend on identity of\r\nmetre. The family books also contain groups; but each of these is\r\nformed of hymns addressed to one and the same deity.\r\n\r\nTurning to the principle on which the entire books of the Rigveda are\r\narranged in relation to one another, we find that Books II.-VII., if\r\nallowance is made for later additions, form a series of collections\r\nwhich contain a successively increasing number of hymns. This fact,\r\ncombined with the uniformity of these books in general character\r\nand internal arrangement, renders it probable that they formed the\r\nnucleus of the Rigveda, to which the remaining books were successively\r\nadded. It further seems likely that the nine shorter collections,\r\nwhich form the second part of Book I., as being similarly based on\r\nidentity of authorship, were subsequently combined and prefixed to the\r\nfamily books, which served as the model for their internal arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe hymns of the eighth book in general show a mutual affinity hardly\r\nless pronounced than that to be found in the family books. For they\r\nare connected by numerous repetitions of similar phrases and lines\r\nrunning through the whole book. The latter, however, does not form a\r\nparallel to the family books. For though a single family, that of the\r\nKanvas, at least predominates among its authors, the prevalence in it\r\nof the strophic form of composition impresses upon it a character of\r\nits own. Moreover, the fact that the eighth book contains fewer hymns\r\nthan the seventh, in itself shows that the former did not constitute\r\none of the family series.\r\n\r\nThe first part (1-50) of Book I. has considerable affinities with\r\nthe eighth, more than half its hymns being attributed to members of\r\nthe Kanva family, while in the hymns composed by some of these Kanvas\r\nthe favourite strophic metre of the eighth book reappears. There are,\r\nmoreover, numerous parallel and directly identical passages in the\r\ntwo collections. It is, however, at present impossible to decide\r\nwhich of the two is the earlier, or why it is that, though so nearly\r\nrelated, they should have been separated. Certain it is that they\r\nwere respectively added at the beginning and the end of a previously\r\nexisting collection, whether they were divided for chronological\r\nreasons or because composed by different branches of the Kanva family.\r\n\r\nAs to the ninth book, it cannot be doubted that it came into being\r\nas a collection after the first eight books had been combined\r\ninto a whole. Its formation was in fact the direct result of that\r\ncombination. The hymns to Soma Pavamana (\"the clearly flowing\") are\r\ncomposed by authors of the same families as produced Books II.-VII.,\r\na fact, apart from other evidence, sufficiently indicated by their\r\nhaving the characteristic refrains of those families. The Pavamana\r\nhymns have affinities to the first and eighth books also. When the\r\nhymns of the different families were combined into books, and clearly\r\nnot till then, all their Pavamana hymns were taken out and gathered\r\ninto a single collection. This of course does not imply that the\r\nPavamana hymns themselves were of recent origin. On the contrary,\r\nthough some of them may date from the time when the tenth book came\r\ninto existence, there is good reason to suppose that the poetry of\r\nthe Soma hymns, which has many points in common with the Avesta,\r\nand deals with a ritual going back to the Indo-Iranian period,\r\nreached its conclusion as a whole in early times among the Vedic\r\nsingers. Differences of age in the hymns of the ninth book have been\r\nalmost entirely effaced; at any rate, research has as yet hardly\r\nsucceeded in distinguishing chronological stages in this collection.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the tenth book, there can be no doubt that its hymns\r\ncame into being at a time when the first nine already existed. Its\r\ncomposers grew up in the knowledge of the older books, with which\r\nthey betray their familiarity at every turn. The fact that the\r\nauthor of one of its groups (20-26) begins with the opening words\r\n(agnim ile) of the first stanza of the Rigveda, is probably an\r\nindication that Books I.-IX. already existed in his day even as a\r\ncombined collection. That the tenth book is indeed an aggregate of\r\nsupplementary hymns is shown by its position after the Soma book, and\r\nby the number of its hymns being made up to that of the first book\r\n(191). The unity which connects its poetry is chronological; for it\r\nis the book of recent groups and recent single hymns. Nevertheless\r\nthe supplements collected in it appear for the most part to be older\r\nthan the additions which occur in the earlier books.\r\n\r\nThere are many criteria, derived from its matter as well as its\r\nform, showing the recent origin of the tenth book. With regard to\r\nmythology, we find the earlier gods beginning to lose their hold\r\non the imagination of these later singers. Some of them seem to\r\nbe disappearing, like the goddess of Dawn, while only deities of\r\nwidely established popularity, such as Indra and Agni, maintain their\r\nposition. The comprehensive group of the Viçve devas, or \"All gods,\"\r\nhas alone increased in prominence. On the other hand, an altogether\r\nnew type, the deification of purely abstract ideas, such as \"Wrath\"\r\nand \"Faith,\" now appears for the first time. Here, too, a number of\r\nhymns are found dealing with subjects foreign to the earlier books,\r\nsuch as cosmogony and philosophical speculation, wedding and burial\r\nrites, spells and incantations, which give to this book a distinctive\r\ncharacter besides indicating its recent origin.\r\n\r\nLinguistically, also, the tenth book is clearly distinguished as later\r\nthan the other books, forming in many respects a transition to the\r\nother Vedas. A few examples will here suffice to show this. Vowel\r\ncontractions occur much more frequently, while the hiatus has\r\ngrown rarer. The use of the letter l, as compared with r, is,\r\nin agreement with later Sanskrit, strikingly on the increase. In\r\ninflexion the employment of the Vedic nominative plural in asas is on\r\nthe decline. With regard to the vocabulary, many old words are going\r\nout of use, while others are becoming commoner. Thus the particle\r\nsim, occurring fifty times in the rest of the Rigveda, is found\r\nonly once in the tenth book. A number of words common in the later\r\nlanguage are only to be met with in this book; for instance, labh,\r\n\"to take,\" kala, \"time,\" lakshmi, \"fortune,\" evam, \"thus.\" Here, too,\r\na number of conscious archaisms can be pointed out.\r\n\r\nThus the tenth book represents a definitely later stratum of\r\ncomposition in the Rigveda. Individual hymns in the earlier books\r\nhave also been proved by various recognised criteria to be of later\r\norigin than others, and some advance has been made towards assigning\r\nthem to three or even five literary epochs. Research has, however,\r\nnot yet arrived at any certain results as to the age of whole groups\r\nin the earlier books. For it must be borne in mind that posteriority\r\nof collection and incorporation does not necessarily prove a later\r\ndate of composition.\r\n\r\nSome hundreds of years must have been needed for all the hymns found in\r\nthe Rigveda to come into being. There was also, doubtless, after the\r\nseparation of the Indians from the Iranians, an intermediate period,\r\nthough it was probably of no great length. In this transitional age\r\nmust have been composed the more ancient poems which are lost, and in\r\nwhich the style of the earliest preserved hymns, already composed with\r\nmuch skill, was developed. The poets of the older part of the Rigveda\r\nthemselves mention predecessors, in whose wise they sing, whose songs\r\nthey desire to renew, and speak of ancestral hymns produced in days of\r\nyore. As far as linguistic evidence is concerned, it affords little\r\nhelp in discriminating periods within the Rigveda except with regard\r\nto the tenth book. For throughout the hymns, in spite of the number of\r\nauthors, essentially the same language prevails. It is quite possible\r\nto distinguish differences of thought, style, and poetical ability,\r\nbut hardly any differences of dialect. Nevertheless, patient and\r\nminute linguistic research, combined with the indications derived\r\nfrom arrangement, metre, and subject-matter, is beginning to yield\r\nevidence which may lead to the recognition of chronological strata\r\nin the older books of the Rigveda.\r\n\r\nThough the aid of MSS. for this early period entirely fails, we yet\r\nhappily possess for the Rigveda an abundant mass of various readings\r\nover 2000 years old. These are contained in the other Vedas, which\r\nare largely composed of hymns, stanzas, and lines borrowed from\r\nthe Rigveda. The other Vedas are, in fact, for the criticism of the\r\nRigveda, what manuscripts are for other literary monuments. We are\r\nthus enabled to collate with the text of the Rigveda directly handed\r\ndown, various readings considerably older than even the testimony of\r\nYaska and of the Pratiçakhyas.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of the various readings supplied by the later Vedas\r\nleads to the conclusion that the text of the Rigveda existed,\r\nwith comparatively few exceptions, in its present form, and not\r\nin a possibly different recension, at the time when the text of the\r\nSama-veda, the oldest form of the Yajur-veda, and the Atharva-veda was\r\nconstituted. The number of cases is infinitesimal in which the Rigveda\r\nshows a corruption from which the others are free. Thus it appears that\r\nthe kernel of Vedic tradition, as represented by the Rigveda, has come\r\ndown to us, with a high degree of fixity and remarkable care for verbal\r\nintegrity, from a period which can hardly be less remote than 1000 B.C.\r\n\r\nIt is only natural that a sacred collection of poetry, historical in\r\nits origin, and the heritage of oral tradition before the other Vedas\r\nwere composed and the details of the later ritual practice were fixed,\r\nshould have continued to be preserved more accurately than texts formed\r\nmainly by borrowing from it hymns which were arbitrarily cut up into\r\ngroups of verses or into single verses, solely in order to meet new\r\nliturgical needs. For those who removed verses of the Rigveda from\r\ntheir context and mixed them up with their own new creations would\r\nnot feel bound to guard such verses from change as strictly as those\r\nwho did nothing but continue to hand down, without any break, the\r\nancient text in its connected form. The control of tradition would\r\nbe wanting where quite a new tradition was being formed.\r\n\r\nThe criticism of the text of the Rigveda itself is concerned with\r\ntwo periods. The first is that in which it existed alone before the\r\nother Vedas came into being; the second is that in which it appears\r\nin the phonetically modified form called the Samhita text, due to the\r\nlabours of grammatical editors. Being handed down in the older period\r\nexclusively by oral tradition, it was not preserved in quite authentic\r\nform down to the time of its final redaction. It did not entirely\r\nescape the fate suffered by all works which, coming down from remote\r\nantiquity, survive into an age of changed linguistic conditions. Though\r\nthere are undeniable corruptions in detail belonging to the older\r\nperiod, the text maintained a remarkably high level of authenticity\r\ntill such modifications as it had undergone reached their conclusion\r\nin the Samhita text. This text differs in hundreds of places from\r\nthat of the composers of the hymns; but its actual words are nearly\r\nalways the same as those used by the ancient seers. Thus there would\r\nbe no uncertainty as to whether the right word, for instance, was\r\nsumnam or dyumnam. The difference lies almost entirely in the phonetic\r\nchanges which the words have undergone according to the rules of Sandhi\r\nprevailing in the classical language. Thus what was formerly pronounced\r\nas tuam hi agne now appears as tvam hy agne. The modernisation of\r\nthe text thereby produced is, however, only partial, and is often\r\ninconsistently applied. The euphonic combinations introduced in\r\nthe Samhita text have interfered with the metre. Hence by reading\r\naccording to the latter the older text can be restored. At the same\r\ntime the Samhita text has preserved the smallest minutiæ of detail\r\nmost liable to corruption, and the slightest difference in the matter\r\nof accent and alternative forms, which might have been removed with\r\nthe greatest ease. Such points furnish an additional proof that the\r\nextreme care with which the verbal integrity of the text was guarded\r\ngoes back to the earlier period itself. Excepting single mistakes of\r\ntradition in the first, and those due to grammatical theories in the\r\nsecond period, the old text of the Rigveda thus shows itself to have\r\nbeen preserved from a very remote antiquity with marvellous accuracy\r\neven in the smallest details.\r\n\r\nFrom the explanatory discussions of the Brahmanas in connection\r\nwith the Rigveda, it results that the text of the latter must\r\nhave been essentially fixed in their time, and that too in quite\r\na special manner, more, for instance, than the prose formulas of\r\nthe Yajurveda. For the Çatapatha Brahmana, while speaking of the\r\npossibility of varying some of these formulas, rejects the notion\r\nof changing the text of a certain Rigvedic verse, proposed by some\r\nteachers, as something not to be thought of. The Brahmanas further\r\noften mention the fact that such and such a hymn or liturgical group\r\ncontains a particular number of verses. All such numerical statements\r\nappear to agree with the extant text of the Rigveda. On the other hand,\r\ntranspositions and omissions of Rigvedic verses are to be found in\r\nthe Brahmanas. These, however, are only connected with the ritual\r\nform of those verses, and in no way show that the text from which\r\nthey were taken was different from ours.\r\n\r\nThe Sutras also contain altered forms of Rigvedic verses, but these\r\nare, as in the case of the Brahmanas, to be explained not from an\r\nolder recension of the text, but from the necessity of adapting them\r\nto new ritual technicalities. On the other hand, they contain many\r\nstatements which confirm our present text. Thus all that the Sutra\r\nof Çankhayana says about the position occupied by verses in a hymn,\r\nor the total number of verses contained in groups of hymns, appears\r\ninvariably to agree with our text.\r\n\r\nWe have yet to answer the question as to when the Samhita text, which\r\nfinally fixed the canonical form of the Rigveda, was constituted. Now\r\nthe Brahmanas contain a number of direct statements as to the number\r\nof syllables in a word or a group of words, which are at variance\r\nwith the Samhita text owing to the vowel contractions made in the\r\nlatter. Moreover, the old part of the Brahmana literature shows\r\nhardly any traces of speculations about phonetic questions connected\r\nwith the Vedic text. The conclusion may therefore be drawn that the\r\nSamhita text did not come into existence till after the completion\r\nof the Brahmanas. With regard to the Aranyakas and Upanishads, which\r\nform supplements to the Brahmanas, the case is different. These works\r\nnot only mention technical grammatical terms for certain groups of\r\nletters, but contain detailed doctrines about the phonetic treatment\r\nof the Vedic text. Here, too, occur for the first time the names of\r\ncertain theological grammarians, headed by Çakalya and Mandukeya, who\r\nare also recognised as authorities in the Pratiçakhyas. The Aranyakas\r\nand Upanishads accordingly form a transition, with reference to the\r\ntreatment of grammatical questions, between the age of the Brahmanas\r\nand that of Yaska and the Pratiçakhyas. The Samhita text must have\r\nbeen created in this intermediate period, say about 600 B.C.\r\n\r\nThis work being completed, extraordinary precautions soon began to be\r\ntaken to guard the canonical text thus fixed against the possibility\r\nof any change or loss. The result has been its preservation with a\r\nfaithfulness unique in literary history. The first step taken in this\r\ndirection was the constitution of the Pada, or \"word\" text, which being\r\nan analysis of the Samhita, gives each separate word in its independent\r\nform, and thus to a considerable extent restores the Samhita text\r\nto an older stage. That the Pada text was not quite contemporaneous\r\nin origin with the other is shown by its containing some undoubted\r\nmisinterpretations and misunderstandings. Its composition can, however,\r\nonly be separated by a short interval from that of the Samhita, for\r\nit appears to have been known to the writer of the Aitareya Aranyaka,\r\nwhile its author, Çakalya, is older than both Yaska, who quotes him,\r\nand Çaunaka, composer of the Rigveda Pratiçakhya, which is based on\r\nthe Pada text.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the latter as a criterion of the authenticity of\r\nverses in the Rigveda is indicated by the following fact. There are\r\nsix verses in the Rigveda [1] not analysed in the Pada text, but only\r\ngiven there over again in the Samhita form. This shows that Çakalya did\r\nnot acknowledge them as truly Rigvedic, a view justified by internal\r\nevidence. This group of six, which is doubtless exhaustive, stands\r\nmidway between old additions which Çakalya recognised as canonical,\r\nand the new appendages called Khilas, which never gained admission\r\ninto the Pada text in any form.\r\n\r\nA further measure for preserving the sacred text from alteration with\r\nstill greater certainty was soon taken in the form of the Krama-patha,\r\nor \"step-text.\" This is old, for it, like the Pada-patha, is already\r\nknown to the author of the Aitareya Aranyaka. Here every word of the\r\nPada text occurs twice, being connected both with that which precedes\r\nand that which follows. Thus the first four words, if represented by a,\r\nb, c, d, would be read as ab, bc, cd. The Jata-patha, or \"woven-text,\"\r\nin its turn based on the Krama-patha, states each of its combinations\r\nthree times, the second time in reversed order (ab, ba, ab; bc,\r\ncb, bc). The climax of complication is reached in the Ghana-patha,\r\nin which the order is ab, ba, abc, cba, abc; bc, cb, bcd, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Pratiçakhyas may also be regarded as safeguards of the text,\r\nhaving been composed for the purpose of exhibiting exactly all the\r\nchanges necessary for turning the Pada into the Samhita text.\r\n\r\nFinally, the class of supplementary works called Anukramanis, or\r\n\"Indices\" aimed at preserving the Rigveda intact by registering its\r\ncontents from various points of view, besides furnishing calculations\r\nof the number of hymns, verses, words, and even syllables, contained\r\nin the sacred book.\r\n\r\nThe text of the Rigveda has come down to us in a single recension\r\nonly; but is there any evidence that other recensions of it existed\r\nin former times?\r\n\r\nThe Charana-vyuha, or \"Exposition of Schools,\" a supplementary work\r\nof the Sutra period, mentions as the five çakhas or \"branches\"\r\nof the Rigveda, the Çakalas, the Vashkalas, the Açvalayanas,\r\nthe Çankhayanas, and the Mandukeyas. The third and fourth of these\r\nschools, however, do not represent different recensions of the text,\r\nthe sole distinction between them and the Çakalas having been that the\r\nAçvalayanas recognised as canonical the group of the eleven Valakhilya\r\nor supplementary hymns, and the Çankhayanas admitted the same group,\r\ndiminished only by a few verses. Hence the tradition of the Puranas,\r\nor later legendary works, mentions only the three schools of Çakalas,\r\nVashkalas, and Mandukas. If the latter ever possessed a recension of an\r\nindependent character, all traces of it were lost at an early period\r\nin ancient India, for no information of any kind about it has been\r\npreserved. Thus only the two schools of the Çakalas and the Vashkalas\r\ncome into consideration. The subsidiary Vedic writings contain\r\nsufficient evidence to show that the text of the Vashkalas differed\r\nfrom that of the Çakalas only in admitting eight additional hymns,\r\nand in assigning another position to a group of the first book. But in\r\nthese respects it compares unfavourably with the extant text. Thus it\r\nis evident that the Çakalas not only possessed the best tradition of\r\nthe text of the Rigveda, but handed down the only recension, in the\r\ntrue sense, which, as far as we can tell, ever existed.\r\n\r\nThe text of the Rigveda, like that of the other Samhitas, as well as\r\nof two of the Brahmanas (the Çatapatha and the Taittiriya, together\r\nwith its Aranyaka), has come down to us in an accented form. The\r\npeculiarly sacred character of the text rendered the accent very\r\nimportant for correct and efficacious recitation. Analogously the\r\naccent was marked by the Greeks in learned and model editions only. The\r\nnature of the Vedic accent was musical, depending on the pitch of the\r\nvoice, like that of the ancient Greeks. This remained the character\r\nof the Sanskrit accent till later than the time of Panini. But just\r\nas the old Greek musical accent, after the beginning of our era,\r\nwas transformed into a stress accent, so by the seventh century\r\nA.D. (and probably long before) the Sanskrit accent had undergone\r\na similar change. While, however, in modern Greek the stress accent\r\nhas remained, owing to the high pitch of the old acute, on the same\r\nsyllable as bore the musical accent in the ancient language, the modern\r\npronunciation of Sanskrit has no connection with the Vedic accent,\r\nbut is dependent on the quantity of the last two or three syllables,\r\nmuch the same as in Latin. Thus the penultimate, if long, is accented,\r\ne.g. Kalidasa, or the antepenultimate, if long and followed by a short\r\nsyllable, e.g. brahmana or Himalaya (\"abode of snow\"). This change of\r\naccent in Sanskrit was brought about by the influence of Prakrit, in\r\nwhich, as there is evidence to show, the stress accent is very old,\r\ngoing back several centuries before the beginning of our era.\r\n\r\nThere are three accents in the Rigveda as well as the other sacred\r\ntexts. The most important of these is the rising accent, called\r\nud-atta (\"raised\"), which corresponds to the Greek acute. Comparative\r\nphilology shows that in Sanskrit it rests on the same syllable as\r\nbore it in the proto-Aryan language. In Greek it is generally on\r\nthe same syllable as in Sanskrit, except when interfered with by\r\nthe specifically Greek law restricting the accent to one of the last\r\nthree syllables. Thus the Greek heptá corresponds to the Vedic saptá,\r\n\"seven.\" The low-pitch accent, which precedes the acute, is called\r\nthe anudatta (\"not raised\"). The third is the falling accent, which\r\nusually follows the acute, and is called svarita (\"sounded\").\r\n\r\nOf the four different systems of marking the accent in Vedic texts,\r\nthat of the Rigveda is most commonly employed. Here the acute is\r\nnot marked at all, while the low-pitch anudatta is indicated by a\r\nhorizontal stroke below the syllable bearing it, and the svarita by\r\na vertical stroke above. Thus yajnasyà (\"of sacrifice\") would mean\r\nthat the second syllable has the acute and the third the svarita\r\n(yajnásyà). The reason why the acute is not marked is because it is\r\nregarded as the middle tone between the other two. [2]\r\n\r\nThe hymns of the Rigveda consist of stanzas ranging in number\r\nfrom three to fifty-eight, but usually not exceeding ten or\r\ntwelve. These stanzas (often loosely called verses) are composed in\r\nsome fifteen different metres, only seven of which, however, are at\r\nall frequent. Three of them are by far the commonest, claiming together\r\nabout four-fifths of the total number of stanzas in the Rigveda.\r\n\r\nThere is an essential difference between Greek and Vedic\r\nprosody. Whereas the metrical unit of the former system is the\r\nfoot, in the latter it is the line (or verse), feet not being\r\ndistinguished. Curiously enough, however, the Vedic metrical unit\r\nis also called pada, or \"foot,\" but for a very different reason;\r\nfor the word has here really the figurative sense of \"quarter\"\r\n(from the foot of a quadruped), Because the most usual kind of\r\nstanza has four lines. The ordinary padas consist of eight, eleven,\r\nor twelve syllables. A stanza or rich is generally formed of three\r\nor four lines of the same kind. Four or five of the rarer types of\r\nstanza are, however, made up of a combination of different lines.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the Vedic metres have a certain elasticity\r\nto which we are unaccustomed in Greek prosody, and which recalls the\r\nirregularities of the Latin Saturnian verse. Only the rhythm of the\r\nlast four or five syllables is determined, the first part of the line\r\nnot being subject to rule. Regarded in their historical connection,\r\nthe Vedic metres, which are the foundation of the entire prosody of the\r\nlater literature, occupy a position midway between the system of the\r\nIndo-Iranian period and that of classical Sanskrit. For the evidence\r\nof the Avesta, with its eight and eleven syllable lines, which ignore\r\nquantity, but are combined into stanzas otherwise the same as those\r\nof the Rigveda, indicates that the metrical practice of the period\r\nwhen Persians and Indians were still one people, depended on no other\r\nprinciple than the counting of syllables. In the Sanskrit period,\r\non the other hand, the quantity of every syllable in the line was\r\ndetermined in all metres, with the sole exception of the loose measure\r\n(called çloka) employed in epic poetry. The metrical regulation of the\r\nline, starting from its end, thus finally extended to the whole. The\r\nfixed rhythm at the end of the Vedic line is called vritta, literally\r\n\"turn\" (from vrit, Lat. vert-ere), which corresponds etymologically\r\nto the Latin versus.\r\n\r\nThe eight-syllable line usually ends in two iambics, the first four\r\nsyllables, though not exactly determined, having a tendency to be\r\niambic also. This verse is therefore the almost exact equivalent of\r\nthe Greek iambic dimeter.\r\n\r\nThree of these lines combine to form the gayatri metre, in which nearly\r\none-fourth (2450) of the total number of stanzas in the Rigveda is\r\ncomposed. An example of it is the first stanza of the Rigveda, which\r\nruns as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Agním ile puróhitam\r\n    Yajnásya devám ritvíjam\r\n    Hótaram ratnadhatamam.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be closely rendered thus in lines imitating the rhythm of\r\nthe original:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    I praise Agni, domestic priest,\r\n    God, minister of sacrifice,\r\n    Herald, most prodigal of wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour of these eight-syllable lines combine to form the anushtubh\r\nstanza, in which the first two and the last two are more closely\r\nconnected. In the Rigveda the number of stanzas in this measure\r\namounts to only about one-third of those in the gayatri. This\r\nrelation is gradually reversed, till we reach the post-Vedic period,\r\nwhen the gayatri is found to have disappeared, and the anushtubh\r\n(now generally called çloka) to have become the predominant measure\r\nof Sanskrit poetry. A development in the character of this metre may\r\nbe observed within the Rigveda itself. All its verses in the oldest\r\nhymns are the same, being iambic in rhythm. In later hymns, however,\r\na tendency to differentiate the first and third from the second\r\nand fourth lines, by making the former non-iambic, begins to show\r\nitself. Finally, in the latest hymns of the tenth book the prevalence\r\nof the iambic rhythm disappears in the odd lines. Here every possible\r\ncombination of quantity in the last four syllables is found, but the\r\ncommonest variation, nearly equalling the iambic in frequency, is\r\n[short][long][long][shortlong]. The latter is the regular ending of\r\nthe first and third line in the post-Vedic çloka.\r\n\r\nThe twelve-syllable line ends thus: [long][short][long][short][short].\r\nFour of these together form the jagati stanza. The trishtubh stanza\r\nconsists of four lines of eleven syllables, which are practically\r\ncatalectic jagatis, as they end [long][short][long][shortlong]. These\r\ntwo verses being so closely allied and having the same cadence, are\r\noften found mixed in the same stanza. The trishtubh is by far the\r\ncommonest metre, about two-fifths of the Rigveda being composed in it.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, a hymn of the Rigveda consists entirely of stanzas\r\nin the same metre. The regular and typical deviation from this rule\r\nis to conclude a hymn with a single stanza in a metre different from\r\nthat of the rest, this being a natural method of distinctly marking\r\nits close.\r\n\r\nA certain number of hymns of the Rigveda consist not merely of a\r\nsuccession of single stanzas, but of equal groups of stanzas. The\r\ngroup consists either of three stanzas in the same simple metre,\r\ngenerally gayatri, or of the combination of two stanzas in different\r\nmixed metres. The latter strophic type goes by the name of Pragatha,\r\nand is found chiefly in the eighth book of the Rigveda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPOETRY OF THE RIGVEDA\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we turn to describe the world of thought revealed in the hymns\r\nof the Rigveda, the question may naturally be asked, to what extent\r\nis it possible to understand the true meaning of a book occupying\r\nso isolated a position in the remotest age of Indian literature? The\r\nanswer to this question depends on the recognition of the right method\r\nof interpretation applicable to that ancient body of poetry. When the\r\nRigveda first became known, European scholars, as yet only acquainted\r\nwith the language and literature of classical Sanskrit, found that the\r\nVedic hymns were composed in an ancient dialect and embodied a world\r\nof ideas far removed from that with which they had made themselves\r\nfamiliar. The interpretation of these hymns was therefore at the\r\noutset barred by almost insurmountable difficulties. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, a voluminous commentary on the Rigveda, which explains or\r\nparaphrases every word of its hymns, was found to exist. This was the\r\nwork of the great Vedic scholar Sayana, who lived in the latter half\r\nof the fourteenth century A.D. at Vijayanagara (\"City of Victory\"),\r\nthe ruins of which lie near Bellary in Southern India. As his\r\ncommentary constantly referred to ancient authorities, it was thought\r\nto have preserved the true meaning of the Rigveda in a traditional\r\ninterpretation going back to the most ancient times. Nothing\r\nfurther seemed to be necessary than to ascertain the explanation\r\nof the original text which prevailed in India five centuries ago,\r\nand is laid down in Sayana's work. This view is represented by the\r\ntranslation of the Rigveda begun in 1850 by H. H. Wilson, the first\r\nprofessor of Sanskrit at Oxford.\r\n\r\nAnother line was taken by the late Professor Roth, the founder\r\nof Vedic philology. This great scholar propounded the view that\r\nthe aim of Vedic interpretation was not to ascertain the meaning\r\nwhich Sayana, or even Yaska, who lived eighteen centuries earlier,\r\nattributed to the Vedic hymns, but the meaning which the ancient\r\npoets themselves intended. Such an end could not be attained by\r\nsimply following the lead of the commentators. For the latter, though\r\nvaluable guides towards the understanding of the later theological\r\nand ritual literature, with the notions and practice of which they\r\nwere familiar, showed no continuity of tradition from the time of\r\nthe poets; for the tradition supplied by them was solely that which\r\nwas handed down among interpreters, and only began when the meaning\r\nof the hymns was no longer fully comprehended. There could, in fact,\r\nbe no other tradition; interpretation only arising when the hymns\r\nhad become obscure. The commentators, therefore, simply preserved\r\nattempts at the solution of difficulties, while showing a distinct\r\ntendency towards misinterpreting the language as well as the religious,\r\nmythological, and cosmical ideas of a vanished age by the scholastic\r\nnotions prevalent in their own.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from what Yaska says that some important discrepancies\r\nin opinion prevailed among the older expositors and the different\r\nschools of interpretation which flourished before his time. He gives\r\nthe names of no fewer than seventeen predecessors, whose explanations\r\nof the Veda are often conflicting. Thus one of them interprets the word\r\nNasatyau, an epithet of the Vedic Dioskouroi, as \"true, not false;\"\r\nanother takes it to mean \"leaders of truth,\" while Yaska himself thinks\r\nit might mean \"nose-born\"! The gap between the poets and the early\r\ninterpreters was indeed so great that one of Yaska's predecessors,\r\nnamed Kautsa, actually had the audacity to assert that the science\r\nof Vedic exposition was useless, as the Vedic hymns and formulas\r\nwere obscure, unmeaning, or mutually contradictory. Such criticisms\r\nYaska meets by replying that it was not the fault of the rafter if\r\nthe blind man did not see it. Yaska himself interprets only a very\r\nsmall portion of the hymns of the Rigveda. In what he does attempt\r\nto explain, he largely depends on etymological considerations for the\r\nsense he assigns. He often gives two or more alternative or optional\r\nsenses to the same word. The fact that he offers a choice of meanings\r\nshows that he had no earlier authority for his guide, and that his\r\nrenderings are simply conjectural; for no one can suppose that the\r\nauthors of the hymns had more than one meaning in their minds.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, highly probable that Yaska, with all the appliances\r\nat his command, was able to ascertain the sense of many words which\r\nscholars who, like Sayana, lived nearly two thousand years later,\r\nhad no means of discovering. Nevertheless Sayana is sometimes found\r\nto depart from Yaska. Thus we arrive at the dilemma that either\r\nthe old interpreter is wrong or the later one does not follow the\r\ntradition. There are also many instances in which Sayana, independently\r\nof Yaska, gives a variety of inconsistent explanations of a word,\r\nboth in interpreting a single passage or in commenting on different\r\npassages. Thus çarada, \"autumnal,\" he explains in one place as\r\n\"fortified for a year,\" in another as \"new or fortified for a year,\"\r\nand in a third as \"belonging to a demon called Çarad.\" One of the\r\ndefects of Sayana is, in fact, that he limits his view in most cases\r\nto the single verse he has before him. A detailed examination of his\r\nexplanations, as well as those of Yaska, has shown that there is in\r\nthe Rigveda a large number of the most difficult words, about the\r\nproper sense of which neither scholar had any certain information from\r\neither tradition or etymology. We are therefore justified in saying\r\nabout them that there is in the hymns no unusual or difficult word\r\nor obscure text in regard to which the authority of the commentators\r\nshould be received as final, unless it is supported by probability,\r\nby the context, or by parallel passages. Thus no translation of\r\nthe Rigveda based exclusively on Sayana's commentary can possibly\r\nbe satisfactory. It would, in fact, be as unreasonable to take him\r\nfor our sole guide as to make our understanding of the Hebrew books\r\nof the Old Testament dependent on the Talmud and the Rabbis. It\r\nmust, indeed, be admitted that from a large proportion of Sayana's\r\ninterpretations most material help can be derived, and that he has\r\nbeen of the greatest service in facilitating and accelerating the\r\ncomprehension of the Veda. But there is little information of value\r\nto be derived from him, that, with our knowledge of later Sanskrit,\r\nwith the other remains of ancient Indian literature, and with our\r\nvarious philological appliances, we might not sooner or later have\r\nfound out for ourselves.\r\n\r\nRoth, then, rejected the commentators as our chief guides in\r\ninterpreting the Rigveda, which, as the earliest literary monument\r\nof the Indian, and indeed of the Aryan race, stands quite by itself,\r\nhigh up on an isolated peak of remote antiquity. As regards its more\r\npeculiar and difficult portions, it must therefore be interpreted\r\nmainly through itself; or, to apply in another sense the words\r\nof an Indian commentator, it must shine by its own light and be\r\nself-demonstrating. Roth further expressed the view that a qualified\r\nEuropean is better able to arrive at the true meaning of the Rigveda\r\nthan a Brahman interpreter. The judgment of the former is unfettered\r\nby theological bias; he possesses the historical faculty, and he has\r\nalso a far wider intellectual horizon, equipped as he is with all\r\nthe resources of scientific scholarship. Roth therefore set himself\r\nto compare carefully all passages parallel in form and matter, with\r\ndue regard to considerations of context, grammar, and etymology,\r\nwhile consulting, though, perhaps, with insufficient attention,\r\nthe traditional interpretations. He thus subjected the Rigveda to a\r\nhistorical treatment within the range of Sanskrit itself. He further\r\ncalled in the assistance rendered from without by the comparative\r\nmethod, utilising the help afforded not only by the Avesta, which is\r\nso closely allied to the Rigveda in language and matter, but also\r\nby the results of comparative philology, resources unknown to the\r\ntraditional scholar.\r\n\r\nBy thus ascertaining the meaning of single words, the foundations\r\nof the scientific interpretation of the Vedas were laid in the\r\ngreat Sanskrit Dictionary, in seven volumes, published by Roth in\r\ncollaboration with Böhtlingk between 1852 and 1875. Roth's method is\r\nnow accepted by every scientific student of the Veda. Native tradition\r\nis, however, being more fully exploited than was done by Roth himself,\r\nfor it is now more clearly recognised that no aid to be derived from\r\nextant Indian scholarship ought to be neglected. Under the guidance of\r\nsuch principles the progress already made in solving many important\r\nproblems presented by Vedic literature has been surprising, when we\r\nconsider the shortness of the time and the fewness of the labourers, of\r\nwhom only two or three have been natives of this country. As a general\r\nresult, the historical sense has succeeded in grasping the spirit of\r\nIndian antiquity, long obscured by native misinterpretation. Much, of\r\ncourse, still remains to be done by future generations of scholars,\r\nespecially in detailed and minute investigation. This could not be\r\notherwise when we remember that Vedic research is only the product\r\nof the last fifty years, and that, notwithstanding the labours of\r\nvery numerous Hebrew scholars during several centuries, there are,\r\nin the Psalms and the Prophetic Books of the Old Testament, still many\r\npassages which remain obscure and disputed. There can be no doubt that\r\nmany problems at present insoluble will in the end be solved by that\r\nmodern scholarship which has already deciphered the cuneiform writings\r\nof Persia as well as the rock inscriptions of India, and has discovered\r\nthe languages which lay hidden under these mysterious characters.\r\n\r\nHaving thus arrived at the threshold of the world of Vedic thought,\r\nwe may now enter through the portals opened by the golden key of\r\nscholarship. By far the greater part of the poetry of the Rigveda\r\nconsists of religious lyrics, only the tenth book containing some\r\nsecular poems. Its hymns are mainly addressed to the various gods of\r\nthe Vedic pantheon, praising their mighty deeds, their greatness,\r\nand their beneficence, or beseeching them for wealth in cattle,\r\nnumerous offspring, prosperity, long life, and victory. The Rigveda\r\nis not a collection of primitive popular poetry, as it was apt to be\r\ndescribed at an earlier period of Sanskrit studies. It is rather a\r\nbody of skilfully composed hymns, produced by a sacerdotal class and\r\nmeant to accompany the Soma oblation and the fire sacrifice of melted\r\nbutter, which were offered according to a ritual by no means so simple\r\nas was at one time supposed, though undoubtedly much simpler than the\r\nelaborate system of the Brahmana period. Its poetry is consequently\r\nmarred by frequent references to the sacrifice, especially when the two\r\ngreat ritual deities, Agni and Soma, are the objects of praise. At the\r\nsame time it is on the whole much more natural than might under these\r\nconditions be expected. For the gods who are invoked are nearly all\r\npersonifications of the phenomena of Nature, and thus give occasion for\r\nthe employment of much beautiful and even noble imagery. The diction of\r\nthe hymns is, generally speaking, simple and unaffected. Compound words\r\nare sparingly used, and are limited to two members, in marked contrast\r\nwith the frequency and length of compounds in classical Sanskrit. The\r\nthought, too, is usually artless and direct, except in the hymns to\r\nthe ritual deities, where it becomes involved in conceit and mystical\r\nobscurity. The very limited nature of the theme, in these cases, must\r\nhave forced the minds of the priestly singers to strive after variety\r\nby giving utterance to the same idea in enigmatical phraseology.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we already find the beginnings of that fondness for\r\nsubtlety and difficult modes of expression which is so prevalent\r\nin the later literature, and which is betrayed even in the earlier\r\nperiod by the saying in one of the Brahmanas that the gods love the\r\nrecondite. In some hymns, too, there appears that tendency to play\r\nwith words which was carried to inordinate lengths in late Sanskrit\r\npoems and romances. The hymns of the Rigveda, of course, vary much in\r\nliterary merit, as is naturally to be expected in the productions of\r\nmany poets extending over some centuries. Many display a high order of\r\npoetical excellence, while others consist of commonplace and mechanical\r\nverse. The degree of skill in composition is on the average remarkably\r\nhigh, especially when we consider that here we have by far the oldest\r\npoetry of the Aryan race. The art which these early seers feel is\r\nneeded to produce a hymn acceptable to the gods is often alluded to,\r\ngenerally in the closing stanza. The poet usually compares his work\r\nto a car wrought and put together by a deft craftsman. One Rishi also\r\nlikens his prayers to fair and well-woven garments; another speaks of\r\nhaving adorned his song of praise like a bride for her lover. Poets\r\nlaud the gods according to knowledge and ability (vi. 21, 6), and\r\ngive utterance to the emotions of their hearts (x. 39, 15). Various\r\nindividual gods are, it is true, in a general way said to have granted\r\nseers the gift of song, but of the later doctrine of revelation the\r\nRigvedic poets know nothing.\r\n\r\nThe remark which has often been made that monotony prevails in\r\nthe Vedic hymns contains truth. But the impression is produced by\r\nthe hymns to the same deity being commonly grouped together in each\r\nbook. A similar effect would probably arise from reading in succession\r\ntwenty or thirty lyrics on Spring, even in an anthology of the best\r\nmodern poetry. When we consider that nearly five hundred hymns of the\r\nRigveda are addressed to two deities alone, it is surprising that so\r\nmany variations of the same theme should be possible.\r\n\r\nThe hymns of the Rigveda being mainly invocations of the gods, their\r\ncontents are largely mythological. Special interest attaches to this\r\nmythology, because it represents an earlier stage of thought than\r\nis to be found in any other literature. It is sufficiently primitive\r\nto enable us to see clearly the process of personification by which\r\nnatural phenomena developed into gods. Never observing, in his ordinary\r\nlife, action or movement not caused by an acting or moving person,\r\nthe Vedic Indian, like man in a much less advanced state, still\r\nrefers such occurrences in Nature to personal agents, which to him\r\nare inherent in the phenomena. He still looks out upon the workings of\r\nNature with childlike astonishment. One poet asks why the sun does not\r\nfall from the sky; another wonders where the stars go by day; while a\r\nthird marvels that the waters of all rivers constantly flowing into it\r\nnever fill the ocean. The unvarying regularity of sun and moon, and the\r\nunfailing recurrence of the dawn, however, suggested to these ancient\r\nsingers the idea of the unchanging order that prevails in Nature. The\r\nnotion of this general law, recognised under the name rita (properly\r\nthe \"course\" of things), we find in the Rigveda extended first to the\r\nfixed rules of the sacrifice (rite), and then to those of morality\r\n(right). Though the mythological phase presented by the Rigveda is\r\ncomparatively primitive, it yet contains many conceptions inherited\r\nfrom previous ages. The parallels of the Avesta show that several of\r\nthe Vedic deities go back to the time when the ancestors of Persians\r\nand Indians were still one people. Among these may be mentioned Yama,\r\ngod of the dead, identical with Yima, ruler of paradise, and especially\r\nMitra, the cult of whose Persian counterpart, Mithra, obtained from\r\n200-400 A.D. a world-wide diffusion in the Roman Empire, and came\r\nnearer to monotheism than the cult of any other god in paganism.\r\n\r\nVarious religious practices can also be traced back to that early\r\nage, such as the worship of fire and the cult of the plant Soma\r\n(the Avestan Haoma). The veneration of the cow, too, dates from that\r\ntime. A religious hymn poetry must have existed even then, for stanzas\r\nof four eleven-syllable (the Vedic trishtubh) and of four or three\r\neight-syllable lines (anushtubh and gayatri) were already known,\r\nas is proved by the agreement of the Avesta with the Rigveda.\r\n\r\nFrom the still earlier Indo-European period had come down the general\r\nconception of \"god\" (deva-s, Lat. deu-s) and that of heaven as a divine\r\nfather (Dyaus pita, Gr. Zeus pater, Lat. Jupiter). Probably from an\r\neven remoter antiquity is derived the notion of heaven and earth as\r\nprimeval and universal parents, as well as many magical beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe universe appeared to the poets of the Rigveda to be divided\r\ninto the three domains of earth, air, and heaven, a division perhaps\r\nalso known to the early Greeks. This is the favourite triad of the\r\nRigveda, constantly mentioned expressly or by implication. The solar\r\nphenomena are referred to heaven, while those of lightning, rain, and\r\nwind belong to the air. In the three worlds the various gods perform\r\ntheir actions, though they are supposed to dwell only in the third,\r\nthe home of light. The air is often called a sea, as the abode of\r\nthe celestial waters, while the great rainless clouds are conceived\r\nsometimes as rocks or mountains, sometimes as the castles of demons\r\nwho war against the gods. The thundering rain-clouds become lowing\r\ncows, whose milk is shed and bestows fatness upon the earth.\r\n\r\nThe higher gods of the Rigveda are almost entirely personifications\r\nof natural phenomena, such as Sun, Dawn, Fire, Wind. Excepting\r\na few deities surviving from an older period, the gods are, for\r\nthe most part, more or less clearly connected with their physical\r\nfoundation. The personifications being therefore but slightly\r\ndeveloped, lack definiteness of outline and individuality of\r\ncharacter. Moreover, the phenomena themselves which are behind the\r\npersonifications have few distinctive traits, while they share some\r\nattributes with other phenomena belonging to the same domain. Thus\r\nDawn, Sun, Fire have the common features of being luminous, dispelling\r\ndarkness, appearing in the morning. Hence the character of each\r\ngod is made up of only a few essential qualities combined with many\r\nothers which are common to all the gods, such as brilliance, power,\r\nbeneficence, and wisdom. These common attributes tend to obscure those\r\nwhich are distinctive, because in hymns of prayer and praise the former\r\nnaturally assume special importance. Again, gods belonging to different\r\ndepartments of nature, but having striking features in common, are apt\r\nto grow more like each other. Assimilation of this kind is encouraged\r\nby a peculiar practice of the Vedic poets--the invocation of deities\r\nin pairs. Such combinations result in attributes peculiar to the one\r\ngod attaching themselves to the other, even when the latter appears\r\nalone. Thus when the Fire-god, invoked by himself, is called a slayer\r\nof the demon Vritra, he receives an attribute distinctive of the\r\nthunder-god Indra, with whom he is often coupled. The possibility of\r\nassigning nearly every power to every god rendered the identification\r\nof one deity with another an easy matter. Such identifications are\r\nfrequent enough in the Rigveda. For example, a poet addressing the\r\nfire-god exclaims: \"Thou at thy birth, O Agni, art Varuna; when kindled\r\nthou becomest Mitra; in thee, O Son of Might, all gods are centred;\r\nthou art Indra to the worshipper\" (v. 3, 1).\r\n\r\nMoreover, mystical speculations on the nature of Agni, so important\r\na god in the eyes of a priesthood devoted to a fire-cult, on his\r\nmany manifestations as individual fires on earth, and on his other\r\naspects as atmospheric fire in lightning and as celestial fire in\r\nthe sun--aspects which the Vedic poets are fond of alluding to in\r\nriddles--would suggest the idea that various deities are but different\r\nforms of a single divine being. This idea is found in more than one\r\npassage of the later hymns of the Rigveda. Thus the composer of a\r\nrecent hymn (164) of the first book says: \"The one being priests speak\r\nof in many ways; they call it Agni, Yama, Matariçvan.\" Similarly, a\r\nseer of the last book (x. 114) remarks: \"Priests and poets with words\r\nmake into many the bird (i.e. the sun) which is but one.\" Utterances\r\nlike these show that by the end of the Rigvedic period the polytheism\r\nof the Rishis had received a monotheistic tinge.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we even find shadowed forth the pantheistic idea of a\r\ndeity representing not only all the gods, but Nature as well. Thus\r\nthe goddess Aditi is identified with all the deities, with men,\r\nwith all that has been and shall be born, with air, and heaven\r\n(i. 89); and in a cosmogonic hymn (x. 121) the Creator is not only\r\ndescribed as the one god above all gods, but is said [3] to embrace\r\nall things. This germ of pantheism developed through the later Vedic\r\nliterature till it assumed its final shape in the Vedanta philosophy,\r\nstill the most popular system of the Hindus.\r\n\r\nThe practice of the poets, even in the older parts of the Rigveda, of\r\ninvoking different gods as if each of them were paramount, gave rise to\r\nProfessor Max Müller's theory of Henotheism or Kathenotheism, according\r\nto which the seers held \"the belief in individual gods alternately\r\nregarded as the highest,\" and for the moment treated the god addressed\r\nas if he were an absolutely independent and supreme deity, alone\r\npresent to the mind. In reality, however, the practice of the poets\r\nof the Rigveda hardly amounts to more than the exaggeration--to be\r\nfound in the Homeric hymns also--with which a singer would naturally\r\nmagnify the particular god whom he is invoking. For the Rishis well\r\nknew the exact position of each god in the Soma ritual, in which\r\nnearly every member of the pantheon found a place.\r\n\r\nThe gods, in the view of the Vedic poets, had a beginning; for they are\r\ndescribed as the offspring of heaven and earth, or sometimes of other\r\ngods. This in itself implies different generations, but earlier gods\r\nare also expressly referred to in several passages. Nor were the gods\r\nregarded as originally immortal; for immortality is said to have been\r\nbestowed upon them by individual deities, such as Agni and Savitri,\r\nor to have been acquired by drinking soma. Indra and other gods are\r\nspoken of as unaging, but whether their immortality was regarded by\r\nthe poets as absolute there is no evidence to show. In the post-Vedic\r\nview it was only relative, being limited to a cosmic age.\r\n\r\nThe physical aspect of the Vedic gods is anthropomorphic. Thus head,\r\nface, eyes, arms, hands, feet, and other portions of the human\r\nframe are ascribed to them. But their forms are shadowy and their\r\nlimbs or parts are often simply meant figuratively to describe their\r\nactivities. Thus the tongue and limbs of the fire-god are merely his\r\nflames; the arms of the sun-god are simply his rays, while his eye\r\nonly represents the solar orb. Since the outward shape of the gods was\r\nthus vaguely conceived, while their connection with natural phenomena\r\nwas in many instances still evident, it is easy to understand why no\r\nmention is made in the Rigveda of images of the gods, still less of\r\ntemples, which imply the existence of images. Idols first begin to\r\nbe referred to in the Sutras.\r\n\r\nSome of the gods appear equipped as warriors, wearing coats of mail\r\nand helmets, and armed with spears, battle-axes, bows and arrows. They\r\nall drive through the air in luminous cars, generally drawn by horses,\r\nbut in some cases by kine, goats, or deer. In their cars the gods\r\ncome to seat themselves at the sacrifice, which, however, is also\r\nconveyed to them in heaven by Agni. They are on the whole conceived\r\nas dwelling together in harmony; the only one who ever introduces a\r\nnote of discord being the warlike and overbearing Indra.\r\n\r\nTo the successful and therefore optimistic Vedic Indian, the gods\r\nseemed almost exclusively beneficent beings, bestowers of long life\r\nand prosperity. Indeed, the only deity in whom injurious features are\r\nat all prominent is Rudra. The lesser evils closely connected with\r\nhuman life, such as disease, proceed from minor demons, while the\r\ngreater evils manifested in Nature, such as drought and darkness, are\r\nproduced by powerful demons like Vritra. The conquest of these demons\r\nbrings out all the more strikingly the beneficent nature of the gods.\r\n\r\nThe character of the Vedic gods is also moral. They are \"true\" and\r\n\"not deceitful,\" being throughout the friends and guardians of honesty\r\nand virtue. But the divine morality only reflects the ethical standard\r\nof an early civilisation. Thus even the alliance of Varuna, the most\r\nmoral of the gods, with righteousness is not such as to prevent him\r\nfrom employing craft against the hostile and the deceitful man. Moral\r\nelevation is, on the whole, a less prominent characteristic of the\r\ngods than greatness and power.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the worshipper to the gods in the Rigveda is in\r\ngeneral one of dependence on their will, prayers and sacrifices\r\nbeing offered to win their favour or forgiveness. The expectation\r\nof something in return for the offering is, however, frequently\r\napparent, and the keynote of many a hymn is, \"I give to thee that\r\nthou mayst give to me.\" The idea is also often expressed that the\r\nmight and valour of the gods is produced by hymns, sacrifices, and\r\nespecially offerings of soma. Here we find the germs of sacerdotal\r\npretensions which gradually increased during the Vedic age. Thus the\r\nstatement occurs in the White Yajurveda that the Brahman who possesses\r\ncorrect knowledge has the gods in his power. The Brahmanas go a step\r\nfarther in saying that there are two kinds of gods, the Devas and the\r\nBrahmans, the latter of whom are to be held as deities among men. In\r\nthe Brahmanas, too, the sacrifice is represented as all-powerful,\r\ncontrolling not only the gods, but the very processes of nature.\r\n\r\nThe number of the gods is stated in the Rigveda itself to be\r\nthirty-three, several times expressed as thrice eleven, when each\r\ngroup is regarded as corresponding to one of the divisions of the\r\nthreefold universe. This aggregate could not always have been deemed\r\nexhaustive, for sometimes other gods are mentioned in addition to the\r\nthirty-three. Nor can this number, of course, include various groups,\r\nsuch as the storm-gods.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, hardly twenty individual deities important\r\nenough in the Rigveda to have at least three entire hymns addressed\r\nto them. The most prominent of these are Indra, the thunder-god,\r\nwith at least 250 hymns, Agni with about 200, and Soma with over 100;\r\nwhile Parjanya, god of rain, and Yama, god of the dead, are invoked\r\nin only three each. The rest occupy various positions between these\r\ntwo extremes. It is somewhat remarkable that the two great deities\r\nof modern Hinduism, Vishnu and Çiva, who are equal in importance,\r\nshould have been on the same level, though far below the leading\r\ndeities, three thousand years ago, as Vishnu and Rudra (the earlier\r\nform of Çiva) in the Rigveda. Even then they show the same general\r\ncharacteristics as now, Vishnu being specially benevolent and Rudra\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\nThe oldest among the gods of heaven is Dyaus (identical with the Greek\r\nZeus). This personification of the sky as a god never went beyond a\r\nrudimentary stage in the Rigveda, being almost entirely limited to the\r\nidea of paternity. Dyaus is generally coupled with Prithivi, Earth,\r\nthe pair being celebrated in six hymns as universal parents. In a\r\nfew passages Dyaus is called a bull, ruddy and bellowing downwards,\r\nwith reference to the fertilising power of rain no less than to the\r\nlightning and thundering heavens. He is also once compared with a\r\nblack steed decked with pearls, in obvious allusion to the nocturnal\r\nstar-spangled sky. One poet describes this god as furnished with\r\na bolt, while another speaks of him as \"Dyaus smiling through the\r\nclouds,\" meaning the lightening sky. In several other passages of\r\nthe Rigveda the verb \"to smile\" (smi) alludes to lightning, just as\r\nin classical Sanskrit a smile is constantly compared with objects of\r\ndazzling whiteness.\r\n\r\nA much more important deity of the sky is Varuna, in whom the\r\npersonification has proceeded so far that the natural phenomenon which\r\nunderlies it can only be inferred from traits in his character. This\r\nobscurity of origin arises partly from his not being a creation of\r\nIndian mythology, but a heritage from an earlier age, and partly\r\nfrom his name not at the same time designating a natural phenomenon,\r\nlike that of Dyaus. The word varuna-s seems to have originally\r\nmeant the \"encompassing\" sky, and is probably the same word as the\r\nGreek Ouranos, though the identification presents some phonetic\r\ndifficulties. Varuna is invoked in far fewer hymns than Indra, Agni,\r\nor Soma, but he is undoubtedly the greatest of the Vedic gods by the\r\nside of Indra. While Indra is the great warrior, Varuna is the great\r\nupholder of physical and moral order (rita). The hymns addressed to\r\nhim are more ethical and devout in tone than any others. They form\r\nthe most exalted portion of the Veda, often resembling in character\r\nthe Hebrew psalms. The peaceful sway of Varuna is explained by his\r\nconnection with the regularly recurring celestial phenomena, the\r\ncourse of the heavenly bodies seen in the sky; Indra's warlike and\r\noccasionally capricious nature is accounted for by the variable and\r\nuncertain strife of the elements in the thunderstorm. The character\r\nand power of Varuna may be sketched as nearly as possible in the\r\nwords of the Vedic poets themselves as follows. By the law of Varuna\r\nheaven and earth are held apart. He made the golden swing (the sun) to\r\nshine in heaven. He has made a wide path for the sun. The wind which\r\nresounds through the air is Varuna's breath. By his ordinances the\r\nmoon shining brightly moves at night, and the stars placed up on high\r\nare seen at night but disappear by day. He causes the rivers to flow;\r\nthey stream unceasingly according to his ordinance. By his occult\r\npower the rivers swiftly pouring into the ocean do not fill it with\r\nwater. He makes the inverted cask to pour its waters and to moisten\r\nthe ground, while the mountains are wrapt in cloud. It is chiefly with\r\nthese aërial waters that he is connected, very rarely with the sea.\r\n\r\nVaruna's omniscience is often dwelt on. He knows the flight of the\r\nbirds in the sky, the path of ships in the ocean, the course of\r\nthe far-travelling wind. He beholds all the secret things that have\r\nbeen or shall be done. He witnesses men's truth and falsehood. No\r\ncreature can even wink without him. As a moral governor Varuna stands\r\nfar above any other deity. His wrath is roused by sin, which is the\r\ninfringement of his ordinances, and which he severely punishes. The\r\nfetters with which he binds sinners are often mentioned. A dispeller,\r\nhater, and punisher of falsehood, he is gracious to the penitent. He\r\nreleases men not only from the sins which they themselves commit,\r\nbut from those committed by their fathers. He spares the suppliant\r\nwho daily transgresses his laws, and is gracious to those who have\r\nbroken his ordinances by thoughtlessness. There is, in fact, no hymn\r\nto Varuna in which the prayer for forgiveness of guilt does not occur,\r\nas in the hymns to other deities the prayer for worldly goods.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of the conception of the creator, Prajapati, as\r\na supreme deity, the characteristics of Varuna as a sovereign god\r\nnaturally faded away, and the dominion of waters, only a part of his\r\noriginal sphere, alone remained. This is already partly the case in\r\nthe Atharva-veda, and in post-Vedic mythology he is only an Indian\r\nNeptune, god of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe following stanzas from a hymn to Varuna (vii. 89) will illustrate\r\nthe spirit of the prayers addressed to him:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    May I not yet, King Varuna,\r\n    Go down into the house of clay:\r\n    Have mercy, spare me, mighty Lord.\r\n\r\n    Thirst has come on thy worshipper\r\n    Though standing in the waters' midst: [4]\r\n    Have mercy, spare me, mighty Lord.\r\n\r\n    O Varuna, whatever the offence may be\r\n    That we as men commit against the heavenly folk\r\n    When through our want of thought we violate thy laws,\r\n    Chastise us not, O God, for that iniquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are in the Rigveda five solar deities, differentiated as\r\nrepresenting various aspects of the activity of the sun. One of the\r\noldest of these, Mitra, the \"Friend,\" seems to have been conceived as\r\nthe beneficent side of the sun's power. Going back to the Indo-Iranian\r\nperiod, he has in the Rigveda almost entirely lost his individuality,\r\nwhich is practically merged in that of Varuna. With the latter he is\r\nconstantly invoked, while only one single hymn (iii. 59) is addressed\r\nto him alone.\r\n\r\nSurya (cognate in name to the Greek Helios) is the most concrete\r\nof the solar deities. For as his name also designates the luminary\r\nitself, his connection with the latter is never lost sight of. The\r\neye of Surya is often mentioned, and Dawn is said to bring the eye\r\nof the gods. All-seeing, he is the spy of the whole world, beholding\r\nall beings and the good or bad deeds of mortals. Aroused by Surya, men\r\npursue their objects and perform their work. He is the soul or guardian\r\nof all that moves and is fixed. He rides in a car, which is generally\r\ndescribed as drawn by seven steeds. These he unyokes at sunset:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    When he has loosed his coursers from their station,\r\n    Straightway Night over all spreads out her garment (i. 115, 4).\r\n\r\n\r\nSurya rolls up the darkness like a skin, and the stars slink away like\r\nthieves. He shines forth from the lap of the dawns. He is also spoken\r\nof as the husband of Dawn. As a form of Agni, the gods placed him in\r\nheaven. He is often described as a bird or eagle traversing space. He\r\nmeasures the days and prolongs life. He drives away disease and evil\r\ndreams. At his rising he is prayed to declare men sinless to Mitra and\r\nVaruna. All beings depend on Surya, and so he is called \"all-creating.\"\r\n\r\nEleven hymns, or about the same number as to Surya, are addressed to\r\nanother solar deity, Savitri, the \"Stimulator,\" who represents the\r\nquickening activity of the sun. He is pre-eminently a golden deity,\r\nwith golden hands and arms and a golden car. He raises aloft his\r\nstrong golden arms, with which he blesses and arouses all beings,\r\nand which extend to the ends of the earth. He moves in his golden car,\r\nseeing all creatures, on a downward and an upward path. He shines after\r\nthe path of the dawn. Beaming with the rays of the sun, yellow-haired,\r\nSavitri raises up his light continually from the east. He removes evil\r\ndreams and drives away demons and sorcerers. He bestows immortality\r\non the gods as well as length of life on man. He also conducts the\r\ndeparted spirit to where the righteous dwell. The other gods follow\r\nSavitri's lead; no being, not even the most powerful gods, Indra\r\nand Varuna, can resist his will and independent sway. Savitri is not\r\ninfrequently connected with the evening, being in one hymn (ii. 38)\r\nextolled as the setting sun:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Borne by swift coursers, he will now unyoke them:\r\n    The speeding chariot he has stayed from going.\r\n    He checks the speed of them that glide like serpents:\r\n    Night has come on by Savitri's commandment.\r\n    The weaver rolls her outstretched web together,\r\n    The skilled lay down their work in midst of toiling,\r\n    The birds all seek their nests, their shed the cattle:\r\n    Each to his lodging Savitri disperses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this god is addressed the most famous stanza of the Rigveda,\r\nwith which, as the Stimulator, he was in ancient times invoked at\r\nthe beginning of Vedic study, and which is still repeated by every\r\northodox Hindu in his morning prayers. From the name of the deity\r\nit is called the Savitri, but it is also often referred to as \"the\r\nGayatri,\" from the metre in which it is composed:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    May we attain that excellent\r\n    Glory of Savitri the god,\r\n    That he may stimulate our thoughts (iii. 62, 10).\r\n\r\n\r\nA peculiarity of the hymns to Savitri is the perpetual play on his name\r\nwith forms of the root su, \"to stimulate,\" from which it is derived.\r\n\r\nPushan is invoked in some eight hymns of the Rigveda. His name means\r\n\"Prosperer,\" and the conception underlying his character seems to\r\nbe the beneficent power of the sun, manifested chiefly as a pastoral\r\ndeity. His car is drawn by goats and he carries a goad. Knowing the\r\nways of heaven, he conducts the dead on the far path to the fathers. He\r\nis also a guardian of roads, protecting cattle and guiding them with\r\nhis goad. The welfare which he bestows results from the protection he\r\nextends to men and cattle on earth, and from his guidance of mortals\r\nto the abodes of bliss in the next world.\r\n\r\nJudged by a statistical standard, Vishnu is only a deity of the fourth\r\nrank, less frequently invoked than Surya, Savitri, and Pushan in\r\nthe Rigveda, but historically he is the most important of the solar\r\ndeities. For he is one of the two great gods of modern Hinduism. The\r\nessential feature of his character is that he takes three strides,\r\nwhich doubtless represent the course of the sun through the three\r\ndivisions of the universe. His highest step is heaven, where the gods\r\nand the fathers dwell. For this abode the poet expresses his longing\r\nin the following words (i. 154, 5):--\r\n\r\n\r\n    May I attain to that, his well-loved dwelling,\r\n    Where men devoted to the gods are blessèd:\r\n    In Vishnu's highest step--he is our kinsman,\r\n    Of mighty stride--there is a spring of nectar.\r\n\r\n\r\nVishnu seems to have been originally conceived as the sun, not in\r\nhis general character, but as the personified swiftly moving luminary\r\nwhich with vast strides traverses the three worlds. He is in several\r\npassages said to have taken his three steps for the benefit of man.\r\n\r\nTo this feature may be traced the myth of the Brahmanas in which Vishnu\r\nappears in the form of a dwarf as an artifice to recover the earth,\r\nnow in the possession of demons, by taking his three strides. His\r\ncharacter for benevolence was in post-Vedic mythology developed in\r\nthe doctrine of the Avatars (\"descents\" to earth) or incarnations\r\nwhich he assumed for the good of humanity.\r\n\r\nUshas, goddess of dawn, is almost the only female deity to whom entire\r\nhymns are addressed, and the only one invoked with any frequency. She,\r\nhowever, is celebrated in some twenty hymns. The name, meaning the\r\n\"Shining One,\" is cognate to the Latin Aurora and the Greek Eos. When\r\nthe goddess is addressed, the physical phenomenon of dawn is never\r\nabsent from the poet's mind. The fondness with which the thoughts of\r\nthese priestly singers turned to her alone among the goddesses, though\r\nshe received no share in the offering of soma like the other gods,\r\nseems to show that the glories of the dawn, more splendid in Northern\r\nIndia than those we are wont to see, deeply impressed the minds of\r\nthese early poets. In any case, she is their most graceful creation,\r\nthe charm of which is unsurpassed in the descriptive religious lyrics\r\nof any other literature. Here there are no priestly subtleties to\r\nobscure the brightness of her form, and few allusions to the sacrifice\r\nto mar the natural beauty of the imagery.\r\n\r\nTo enable the reader to estimate the merit of this poetry I will\r\nstring together some utterances about the Dawn goddess, culled from\r\nvarious hymns, and expressed as nearly as possible in the words of\r\ntheir composers. Ushas is a radiant maiden, born in the sky, daughter\r\nof Dyaus. She is the bright sister of dark Night. She shines with\r\nthe light of her lover, with the light of Surya, who beams after\r\nher path and follows her as a young man a maiden. She is borne on\r\na brilliant car, drawn by ruddy steeds or kine. Arraying herself in\r\ngay attire like a dancer, she displays her bosom. Clothed upon with\r\nlight, the maiden appears in the east and unveils her charms. Rising\r\nresplendent as from a bath, she shows her form. Effulgent in peerless\r\nbeauty, she withholds her light from neither small nor great. She\r\nopens wide the gates of heaven; she opens the doors of darkness,\r\nas the cows (issue from) their stall. Her radiant beams appear\r\nlike herds of cattle. She removes the black robe of night, warding\r\noff evil spirits and the hated darkness. She awakens creatures that\r\nhave feet, and makes the birds fly up: she is the breath and life of\r\neverything. When Ushas shines forth, the birds fly up from their nests\r\nand men seek nourishment. She is the radiant mover of sweet sounds,\r\nthe leader of the charm of pleasant voices. Day by day appearing at\r\nthe appointed place, she never infringes the rule of order and of the\r\ngods; she goes straight along the path of order; knowing the way,\r\nshe never loses her direction. As she shone in former days, so she\r\nshines now and will shine in future, never aging, immortal.\r\n\r\nThe solitude and stillness of the early morning sometimes suggested\r\npensive thoughts about the fleeting nature of human life in contrast\r\nwith the unending recurrence of the dawn. Thus one poet exclaims:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gone are the mortals who in former ages\r\n    Beheld the flushing of the earlier morning.\r\n    We living men now look upon her shining;\r\n    They are coming who shall in future see her (i. 113, 11).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a similar strain another Rishi sings:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Again and again newly born though ancient,\r\n    Decking her beauty with the self-same colours,\r\n    The goddess wastes away the life of mortals,\r\n    Like wealth diminished by the skilful player (i. 92, 10).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following stanzas from one of the finest hymns to Dawn (i. 113)\r\nfurnish a more general picture of this fairest creation of Vedic\r\npoetry:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    This light has come, of all the lights the fairest,\r\n    The brilliant brightness has been born, far-shining.\r\n    Urged onward for god Savitri's uprising,\r\n    Night now has yielded up her place to Morning.\r\n\r\n    The sisters' pathway is the same, unending:\r\n    Taught by the gods, alternately they tread it.\r\n    Fair-shaped, of different forms and yet one-minded,\r\n    Night and Morning clash not, nor do they linger.\r\n\r\n    Bright leader of glad sounds, she shines effulgent:\r\n    Widely she has unclosed for us her portals.\r\n    Arousing all the world, she shows us riches:\r\n    Dawn has awakened every living creature.\r\n\r\n    There Heaven's Daughter has appeared before us,\r\n    The maiden flushing in her brilliant garments.\r\n    Thou sovran lady of all earthly treasure,\r\n    Auspicious Dawn, flush here to-day upon us.\r\n\r\n    In the sky's framework she has shone with splendour;\r\n    The goddess has cast off the robe of darkness.\r\n    Wakening up the world with ruddy horses,\r\n    Upon her well-yoked chariot Dawn is coming.\r\n\r\n    Bringing upon it many bounteous blessings,\r\n    Brightly shining, she spreads her brilliant lustre.\r\n    Last of the countless mornings that have gone by,\r\n    First of bright morns to come has Dawn arisen.\r\n\r\n    Arise! the breath, the life, again has reached us:\r\n    Darkness has gone away and light is coming.\r\n    She leaves a pathway for the sun to travel:\r\n    We have arrived where men prolong existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the deities of celestial light, those most frequently invoked are\r\nthe twin gods of morning named Açvins. They are the sons of Heaven,\r\neternally young and handsome. They ride on a car, on which they are\r\naccompanied by the sun-maiden Surya. This car is bright and sunlike,\r\nand all its parts are golden. The time when these gods appear is the\r\nearly dawn, when \"darkness still stands among the ruddy cows.\" At\r\nthe yoking of their car Ushas is born.\r\n\r\nMany myths are told about the Açvins as succouring divinities. They\r\ndeliver from distress in general, especially rescuing from the ocean\r\nin a ship or ships. They are characteristically divine physicians,\r\nwho give sight to the blind and make the lame to walk. One very\r\ncurious myth is that of the maiden Viçpala, who having had her leg\r\ncut off in some conflict, was at once furnished by the Açvins with an\r\niron limb. They agree in many respects with the two famous horsemen\r\nof Greek mythology, the Dioskouroi, sons of Zeus and brothers of\r\nHelen. The two most probable theories as to the origin of these twin\r\ndeities are, that they represent either the twilight, half dark,\r\nhalf light, or the morning and evening star.\r\n\r\nIn the realm of air Indra is the dominant deity. He is, indeed,\r\nthe favourite and national god of the Vedic Indian. His importance\r\nis sufficiently indicated by the fact that more than one-fourth of\r\nthe Rigveda is devoted to his praise. Handed down from a bygone age,\r\nIndra has become more anthropomorphic and surrounded by mythological\r\nimagery than any other Vedic god. The significance of his character\r\nis nevertheless sufficiently clear. He is primarily the thunder-god,\r\nthe conquest of the demon of drought or darkness named Vritra, the\r\n\"Obstructor,\" and the consequent liberation of the waters or the\r\nwinning of light, forming his mythological essence. This myth furnishes\r\nthe Rishis with an ever-recurring theme. Armed with his thunderbolt,\r\nexhilarated by copious draughts of soma, and generally escorted by\r\nthe Maruts or Storm-gods, Indra enters upon the fray. The conflict is\r\nterrible. Heaven and earth tremble with fear when Indra smites Vritra\r\nlike a tree with his bolt. He is described as constantly repeating\r\nthe combat. This obviously corresponds to the perpetual renewal of\r\nthe natural phenomena underlying the myth. The physical elements in\r\nthe thunderstorm are seldom directly mentioned by the poets when\r\ndescribing the exploits of Indra. He is rarely said to shed rain,\r\nbut constantly to release the pent-up waters or rivers. The lightning\r\nis regularly the \"bolt,\" while thunder is the lowing of the cows or\r\nthe roaring of the dragon. The clouds are designated by various names,\r\nsuch as cow, udder, spring, cask, or pail. They are also rocks (adri),\r\nwhich encompass the cows set free by Indra. They are further mountains\r\nfrom which Indra casts down the demons dwelling upon them. They\r\nthus often become fortresses (pur) of the demons, which are ninety,\r\nninety-nine, or a hundred in number, and are variously described as\r\n\"moving,\" \"autumnal,\" \"made of iron or stone.\" One stanza (x. 89, 7)\r\nthus brings together the various features of the myth: \"Indra slew\r\nVritra, broke the castles, made a channel for the rivers, pierced\r\nthe mountain, and delivered over the cows to his friends.\" Owing to\r\nthe importance of the Vritra myth, the chief and specific epithet of\r\nIndra is Vritrahan, \"slayer of Vritra.\" The following stanzas are from\r\none of the most graphic of the hymns which celebrate the conflict of\r\nIndra with the demon (i. 32):--\r\n\r\n\r\n    I will proclaim the manly deeds of Indra,\r\n    The first that he performed, the lightning-wielder.\r\n    He smote the dragon, then discharged the waters,\r\n    And cleft the caverns of the lofty mountains.\r\n\r\n    Impetuous as a bull, he chose the soma,\r\n    And drank in threefold vessels of its juices.\r\n    The Bounteous god grasped lightning for his missile,\r\n    He struck down dead that first-born of the dragons.\r\n\r\n    Him lightning then availèd naught, nor thunder,\r\n    Nor mist nor hailstorm which he spread around him:\r\n    When Indra and the dragon strove in battle,\r\n    The Bounteous god gained victory for ever.\r\n\r\n    Plunged in the midst of never-ceasing torrents,\r\n    That stand not still but ever hasten onward,\r\n    The waters bear off Vritra's hidden body:\r\n    Indra's fierce foe sank down to lasting darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the liberation of the waters is connected the winning of light\r\nand the sun. Thus we read that when Indra had slain the dragon Vritra\r\nwith his bolt, releasing the waters for man, he placed the sun visibly\r\nin the heavens, or that the sun shone forth when Indra blew the dragon\r\nfrom the air.\r\n\r\nIndra naturally became the god of battle, and is more frequently\r\ninvoked than any other deity as a helper in conflicts with earthly\r\nenemies. In the words of one poet, he protects the Aryan colour\r\n(varna) and subjects the black skin; while another extols him for\r\nhaving dispersed 50,000 of the black race and rent their citadels. His\r\ncombats are frequently called gavishti, \"desire of cows,\" his gifts\r\nbeing considered the result of victories.\r\n\r\nThe following stanzas (ii. 12, 2 and 13) will serve as a specimen of\r\nthe way in which the greatness of Indra is celebrated:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who made the widespread earth when quaking steadfast,\r\n    Who brought to rest the agitated mountains.\r\n    Who measured out air's intermediate spaces,\r\n    Who gave the sky support: he, men, is Indra.\r\n\r\n    Heaven and earth themselves bow down before him,\r\n    Before his might the very mountains tremble.\r\n    Who, known as Soma-drinker, armed with lightning,\r\n    Is wielder of the bolt: he, men, is Indra.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the more advanced anthropomorphism of Indra's nature are due\r\nthe occasional immoral traits which appear in his character. Thus\r\nhe sometimes indulges in acts of capricious violence, such as the\r\nslaughter of his father or the destruction of the car of Dawn. He\r\nis especially addicted to soma, of which he is described as drinking\r\nenormous quantities to stimulate him in the performance of his warlike\r\nexploits. One entire hymn (x. 119) consists of a monologue in which\r\nIndra, inebriated with soma, boasts of his greatness and power. Though\r\nof little poetic merit, this piece has a special interest as being\r\nby far the earliest literary description of the mental effects,\r\nbraggadocio in particular, produced by intoxication. In estimating\r\nthe morality of Indra's excesses, it should not be forgotten that the\r\nexhilaration of soma partook of a religious character in the eyes of\r\nthe Vedic poets.\r\n\r\nIndra's name is found in the Avesta as that of a demon. His\r\ndistinctive Vedic epithet, Vritrahan, also occurs there in the form\r\nof verethraghna, as a designation of the god of victory. Hence there\r\nwas probably in the Indo-Iranian period a god approaching to the\r\nVedic form of the Vritra-slaying and victorious Indra.\r\n\r\nIn comparing historically Varuna and Indra, whose importance was\r\nabout equal in the earlier period of the Rigveda, it seems clear that\r\nVaruna was greater in the Indo-Iranian period, but became inferior\r\nto Indra in later Vedic times. Indra, on the other hand, became in\r\nthe Brahmanas and Epics the chief of the Indian heaven, and even\r\nmaintained this position under the Puranic triad, Brahma-Vishnu-Çiva,\r\nthough of course subordinate to them.\r\n\r\nAt least three of the lesser deities of the air are connected with\r\nlightning. One of these is the somewhat obscure god Trita, who is\r\nonly mentioned in detached verses of the Rigveda. The name appears\r\nto designate the \"third\" (Greek, trito-s), as the lightning form of\r\nfire. His frequent epithet, Aptya, seems to mean the \"watery.\" This god\r\ngoes back to the Indo-Iranian period, as both his name and his epithet\r\nare found in the Avesta. But he was gradually ousted by Indra as being\r\noriginally almost identical in character with the latter. Another\r\ndeity of rare occurrence in the Rigveda, and also dating from the\r\nIndo-Iranian period, is Apam napat, the \"Son of Waters.\" He is\r\ndescribed as clothed in lightning and shining without fuel in the\r\nwaters. There can, therefore, be little doubt that he represents fire\r\nas produced from the rain-clouds in the form of lightning. Matariçvan,\r\nseldom mentioned in the Rigveda, is a divine being described as having,\r\nlike the Greek Prometheus, brought down the hidden fire from heaven to\r\nearth. He most probably represents the personification of a celestial\r\nform of Agni, god of fire, with whom he is in some passages actually\r\nidentified. In the later Vedas, the Brahmanas, and the subsequent\r\nliterature, the name has become simply a designation of wind.\r\n\r\nThe position occupied by the god Rudra in the Rigveda is very\r\ndifferent from that of his historical successor in a later age. He is\r\ncelebrated in only three or four hymns, while his name is mentioned\r\nslightly less often than that of Vishnu. He is usually said to be\r\narmed with bow and arrows, but a lightning shaft and a thunderbolt\r\nare also occasionally assigned to him. He is described as fierce\r\nand destructive like a wild beast, and is called \"the ruddy boar\r\nof heaven.\" The hymns addressed to him chiefly express fear of his\r\nterrible shafts and deprecation of his wrath. His malevolence is\r\nstill more prominent in the later Vedic literature. The euphemistic\r\nepithet Çiva, \"auspicious,\" already applied to him in the Rigveda,\r\nand more frequently, though not exclusively, in the younger Vedas,\r\nbecame his regular name in the post-Vedic period. Rudra is, of course,\r\nnot purely malevolent like a demon. He is besought not only to preserve\r\nfrom calamity but to bestow blessings and produce welfare for man\r\nand beast. His healing powers are mentioned with especial frequency,\r\nand he is lauded as the greatest of physicians.\r\n\r\nProminent among the gods of the Rigveda are the Maruts or Storm-gods,\r\nwho form a group of thrice seven or thrice sixty. They are the sons\r\nof Rudra and the mottled cloud-cow Priçni. At birth they are compared\r\nwith fires, and are once addressed as \"born from the laughter of\r\nlightning.\" They are a troop of youthful warriors armed with spears\r\nor battle-axes and wearing helmets upon their heads. They are decked\r\nwith golden ornaments, chiefly in the form of armlets or of anklets:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    They gleam with armlets as the heavens are decked with stars;\r\n    Like cloud-born lightnings shine the torrents of their rain\r\n    (ii. 34, 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nThey ride on golden cars which gleam with lightning, while they hold\r\nfiery lightnings in their hands:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The lightnings smile upon the earth below them\r\n    What time the Maruts sprinkle forth their fatness.--(i. 168, 8).\r\n\r\n\r\nThey drive with coursers which are often described as spotted, and\r\nthey are once said to have yoked the winds as steeds to their pole.\r\n\r\nThe Maruts are fierce and terrible, like lions or wild boars. With\r\nthe fellies of their car they rend the hills:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Maruts spread the mist abroad,\r\n    And make the mountains rock and reel,\r\n    When with the winds they go their way (viii. 7, 4).\r\n\r\n\r\nThey shatter the lords of the forest and like wild elephants devour\r\nthe woods:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Before you, fierce ones, even woods bow down in fear,\r\n    The earth herself, the very mountain trembles (v. 60, 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of their main functions is to shed rain. They are clad in a robe\r\nof rain, and cover the eye of the sun with showers. They bedew the\r\nearth with milk; they shed fatness (ghee); they milk the thundering,\r\nthe never-failing spring; they wet the earth with mead; they pour\r\nout the heavenly pail:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The rivers echo to their chariot fellies\r\n    What time they utter forth the voice of rain-clouds.--(i. 168, 8).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn allusion to the sound of the winds the Maruts are often called\r\nsingers, and as such aid Indra in his fight with the demon. They are,\r\nindeed, his constant associates in all his celestial conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe God of Wind, called Vayu or Vata, is not a prominent deity in\r\nthe Rigveda, having only three entire hymns addressed to him. The\r\npersonification is more developed under the name of Vayu, who is\r\nmostly associated with Indra, while Vata is coupled only with the less\r\nanthropomorphic rain-god, Parjanya. Vayu is swift as thought and has\r\nroaring velocity. He has a shining car drawn by a team or a pair of\r\nruddy steeds. On this car, which has a golden seat and touches the\r\nsky, Indra is his companion. Vata, as also the ordinary designation\r\nof wind, is celebrated in a more concrete manner. His name is often\r\nconnected with the verb va, \"to blow,\" from which it is derived. Like\r\nRudra, he wafts healing and prolongs life; for he has the treasure of\r\nimmortality in his house. The poet of a short hymn (x. 168) devoted\r\nto his praise thus describes him:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Of Vata's car I now will praise the greatness:\r\n    Crashing it speeds along; its noise is thunder.\r\n    Touching the sky, it goes on causing lightnings;\r\n    Scattering the dust of earth it hurries forward.\r\n\r\n    In air upon his pathways hastening onward,\r\n    Never on any day he tarries resting.\r\n    The first-born order-loving friend of waters,\r\n    Where, pray, was he born? say, whence came he hither?\r\n\r\n    The soul of gods, and of the world the offspring,\r\n    This god according to his liking wanders.\r\n    His sound is heard, but ne'er is seen his figure.\r\n    This Vata let us now with offerings worship.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother deity of air is Parjanya, god of rain, who is invoked\r\nin but three hymns, and is only mentioned some thirty times\r\nin the Rigveda. The name in several passages still means simply\r\n\"rain-cloud.\" The personification is therefore always closely connected\r\nwith the phenomenon of the rain-storm, in which the rain-cloud itself\r\nbecomes an udder, a pail, or a water-skin. Often likened to a bull,\r\nParjanya is characteristically a shedder of rain. His activity is\r\ndescribed in very vivid strains (v. 83):--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The trees he strikes to earth and smites the demon crew:\r\n    The whole world fears the wielder of the mighty bolt.\r\n    The guiltless man himself flees from the potent god,\r\n    What time Parjanya thund'ring smites the miscreant.\r\n\r\n    Like a car-driver urging on his steeds with whips,\r\n    He causes to bound forth the messengers of rain.\r\n    From far away the lion's roar reverberates,\r\n    What time Parjanya fills the atmosphere with rain.\r\n\r\n    Forth blow the winds, to earth the lightning flashes fall,\r\n    Up shoot the herbs, the realm of light with moisture streams;\r\n    Nourishment in abundance springs for all the world,\r\n    What time Parjanya quickeneth the earth with seed.\r\n\r\n    Thunder and roar: the vital germ deposit!\r\n    With water-bearing chariot fly around us!\r\n    Thy water-skin unloosed to earth draw downward:\r\n    With moisture make the heights and hollows equal!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Waters are praised as goddesses in four hymns of the Rigveda. The\r\npersonification, however, hardly goes beyond representing them as\r\nmothers, young wives, and goddesses who bestow boons and come to the\r\nsacrifice. As mothers they produce Agni, whose lightning form is,\r\nas we have seen, called Apam Napat, \"Son of Waters.\" The divine\r\nwaters bear away defilement, and are even invoked to cleanse from\r\nmoral guilt, the sins of violence, cursing, and lying. They bestow\r\nremedies, healing, long life, and immortality. Soma delights in the\r\nwaters as a young man in lovely maidens; he approaches them as a lover;\r\nthey are maidens who bow down before the youth.\r\n\r\nSeveral rivers are personified and invoked as deities in the\r\nRigveda. One hymn (x. 75) celebrates the Sindhu or Indus, while\r\nanother (iii. 33) sings the praises of the sister streams Vipaç and\r\nÇutudri. Sarasvati is, however, the most important river goddess,\r\nbeing lauded in three entire hymns as well as in many detached\r\nverses. The personification here goes much further than in the case\r\nof other streams; but the poets never lose sight of the connection of\r\nthe goddess with the river. She is the best of mothers, of rivers,\r\nand of goddesses. Her unfailing breast yields riches of every kind,\r\nand she bestows wealth, plenty, nourishment, and offspring. One\r\npoet prays that he may not be removed from her to fields which are\r\nstrange. She is invoked to descend from the sky, from the great\r\nmountain, to the sacrifice. Such expressions may have suggested the\r\nnotion of the celestial origin and descent of the Ganges, familiar\r\nto post-Vedic mythology. Though simply a river deity in the Rigveda,\r\nSarasvati is in the Brahmanas identified with Vach, goddess of speech,\r\nand has in post-Vedic mythology become the goddess of eloquence and\r\nwisdom, invoked as a muse, and regarded as the wife of Brahma.\r\n\r\nEarth, Prithivi, the Broad One, hardly ever dissociated from Dyaus, is\r\ncelebrated alone in only one short hymn of three stanzas (v. 84). Even\r\nhere the poet cannot refrain from introducing references to her\r\nheavenly spouse as he addresses the goddess,\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who, firmly fixt, the forest trees\r\n    With might supportest in the ground:\r\n    When from the lightning of thy cloud\r\n    The rain-floods of the sky pour down.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe personification is only rudimentary, the attributes of the goddess\r\nbeing chiefly those of the physical earth.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the terrestrial deities is Agni, god of\r\nfire. Next to Indra he is the most prominent of the Vedic gods,\r\nbeing celebrated in more than 200 hymns. It is only natural that\r\nthe personification of the sacrificial fire, the centre around\r\nwhich the ritual poetry of the Veda moves, should engross so much\r\nof the attention of the Rishis. Agni being also the regular name\r\nof the element (Latin, igni-s), the anthropomorphism of the deity\r\nis but slight. The bodily parts of the god have a clear connection\r\nwith the phenomena of terrestrial fire mainly in its sacrificial\r\naspect. In allusion to the oblation of ghee cast in the fire, Agni\r\nis \"butter-backed,\" \"butter-faced,\" or \"butter-haired.\" He is also\r\n\"flame-haired,\" and has a tawny beard. He has sharp, shining, golden,\r\nor iron teeth and burning jaws. Mention is also often made of his\r\ntongue or tongues. He is frequently compared with or directly called\r\na steed, being yoked to the pole of the rite in order to waft the\r\nsacrifice to the gods. He is also often likened to a bird, being winged\r\nand darting with rapid flight to the gods. He eats and chews the forest\r\nwith sharp tooth. His lustre is like the rays of dawn or of the sun,\r\nand resembles the lightnings of the rain-cloud; but his track and his\r\nfellies are black, and his steeds make black furrows. Driven by the\r\nwind, he rushes through the wood. He invades the forests and shears\r\nthe hairs of the earth, shaving it as a barber a beard. His flames\r\nare like the roaring waves of the sea. He bellows like a bull when he\r\ninvades the forest trees; the birds are terrified at the noise when\r\nhis grass-devouring sparks arise. Like the erector of a pillar, he\r\nsupports the sky with his smoke; and one of his distinctive epithets\r\nis \"smoke-bannered.\" He is borne on a brilliant car, drawn by two\r\nor more steeds, which are ruddy or tawny and wind-impelled. He yokes\r\nthem to summon the gods, for he is the charioteer of the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe poets love to dwell on his various births, forms, and abodes. They\r\noften refer to the daily generation of Agni by friction from the\r\ntwo fire-sticks. These are his parents, producing him as a new-born\r\ninfant who is hard to catch. From the dry wood the god is born\r\nliving; the child as soon as born devours his parents. The ten\r\nmaidens said to produce him are the ten fingers used in twirling\r\nthe upright fire-drill. Agni is called \"Son of strength\" because\r\nof the powerful friction necessary in kindling a flame. As the\r\nfire is lit every morning for the sacrifice, Agni is described as\r\n\"waking at dawn.\" Hence, too, he is the \"youngest\" of the gods;\r\nbut he is also old, for he conducted the first sacrifice. Thus he\r\ncomes to be paradoxically called both \"ancient\" and \"very young\"\r\nin the same passage.\r\n\r\nAgni also springs from the aërial waters, and is often said to\r\nhave been brought from heaven. Born on earth, in air, in heaven,\r\nAgni is frequently regarded as having a triple character. The gods\r\nmade him threefold, his births are three, and he has three abodes\r\nor dwellings. \"From heaven first Agni was born, the second time from\r\nus (i.e. men), thirdly in the waters.\" This earliest Indian trinity\r\nis important as the basis of much of the mystical speculation of the\r\nVedic age. It was probably the prototype not only of the later Rigvedic\r\ntriad, Sun, Wind, Fire, spoken of as distributed in the three worlds,\r\nbut also of the triad Sun, Indra, Fire, which, though not Rigvedic,\r\nis still ancient. It is most likely also the historical progenitor\r\nof the later Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, Çiva. This triad of\r\nfires may have suggested and would explain the division of a single\r\nsacrificial fire into the three which form an essential feature of\r\nthe cult of the Brahmanas.\r\n\r\nOwing to the multiplicity of terrestrial fires, Agni is also said\r\nto have many births; for he abides in every family, house, or\r\ndwelling. Kindled in many spots, he is but one; scattered in many\r\nplaces, he is one and the same king. Other fires are attached to him\r\nas branches to a tree. He assumes various divine forms, and has many\r\nnames; but in him are comprehended all the gods, whom he surrounds\r\nas a felly the spokes. Thus we find the speculations about Agni's\r\nvarious forms leading to the monotheistic notion of a unity pervading\r\nthe many manifestations of the divine.\r\n\r\nAgni is an immortal who has taken up his abode among mortals; he is\r\nconstantly called a \"guest\" in human dwellings; and is the only god to\r\nwhom the frequent epithet grihapati, \"lord of the house,\" is applied.\r\n\r\nAs the conductor of sacrifice, Agni is repeatedly called both a\r\n\"messenger\" who moves between heaven and earth and a priest. He is\r\nindeed the great priest, just as Indra is the great warrior.\r\n\r\nAgni is, moreover, a mighty benefactor of his worshippers. With\r\na thousand eyes he watches over the man who offers him oblations;\r\nbut consumes his worshippers' enemies like dry bushes, and strikes\r\ndown the malevolent like a tree destroyed by lightning. All blessings\r\nissue from him as branches from a tree. All treasures are collected\r\nin him, and he opens the door of wealth. He gives rain from heaven\r\nand is like a spring in the desert. The boons which he confers are,\r\nhowever, chiefly domestic welfare, offspring, and general prosperity,\r\nwhile Indra for the most part grants victory, booty, power, and glory.\r\n\r\nProbably the oldest function of fire in regard to its cult is that\r\nof burning and dispelling evil spirits and hostile magic. It still\r\nsurvives in the Rigveda from an earlier age, Agni being said to drive\r\naway the goblins with his light and receiving the epithet rakshohan,\r\n\"goblin-slayer.\" This activity is at any rate more characteristic of\r\nAgni than of any other deity, both in the hymns and in the ritual of\r\nthe Vedas.\r\n\r\nSince the soma sacrifice, beside the cult of fire, forms a main\r\nfeature in the ritual of the Rigveda, the god Soma is naturally one\r\nof its chief deities. The whole of the ninth book, in addition to\r\na few scattered hymns elsewhere, is devoted to his praise. Thus,\r\njudged by the standard of frequency of mention, Soma comes third in\r\norder of importance among the Vedic gods. The constant presence of\r\nthe soma plant and its juice before their eyes set limits to the\r\nimagination of the poets who describe its personification. Hence\r\nlittle is said of Soma's human form or action. The ninth book mainly\r\nconsists of incantations sung over the soma while it is pressed by\r\nthe stones and flows through the woollen strainer into the wooden\r\nvats, in which it is finally offered as a beverage to the gods on a\r\nlitter of grass. The poets are chiefly concerned with these processes,\r\noverlaying them with chaotic imagery and mystical fancies of almost\r\ninfinite variety. When Soma is described as being purified by the\r\nten maidens who are sisters, or by the daughters of Vivasvat (the\r\nrising sun), the ten fingers are meant. The stones used in pounding\r\nthe shoots on a skin \"chew him on the hide of a cow.\" The flowing\r\nof the juice into jars or vats after passing through the filter of\r\nsheep's wool is described in various ways. The streams of soma rush\r\nto the forest of the vats like buffaloes. The god flies like a bird\r\nto settle in the vats. The Tawny One settles in the bowls like a bird\r\nsitting on a tree. The juice being mixed with water in the vat, Soma\r\nis said to rush into the lap of the waters like a roaring bull on the\r\nherd. Clothing himself in waters, he rushes around the vat, impelled by\r\nthe singers. Playing in the wood, he is cleansed by the ten maidens. He\r\nis the embryo or child of waters, which are called his mothers. When\r\nthe priests add milk to soma \"they clothe him in cow-garments.\"\r\n\r\nThe sound made by the soma juice flowing into the vats or bowls is\r\noften referred to in hyperbolical language. Thus a poet says that \"the\r\nsweet drop flows over the filter like the din of combatants.\" This\r\nsound is constantly described as roaring, bellowing, or occasionally\r\neven thundering. In such passages Soma is commonly compared with or\r\ncalled a bull, and the waters, with or without milk, are termed cows.\r\n\r\nOwing to the yellow colour of the juice, the physical quality of Soma\r\nmainly dwelt upon by the poets is his brilliance. His rays are often\r\nreferred to, and he is frequently assimilated to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe exhilarating and invigorating action of soma led to its being\r\nregarded as a divine drink that bestows everlasting life. Hence\r\nit is called amrita, the \"immortal\" draught (allied to the Greek\r\nambrosia). Soma is the stimulant which conferred immortality upon\r\nthe gods. Soma also places his worshipper in the imperishable world\r\nwhere there is eternal light and glory, making him immortal where\r\nKing Yama dwells. Thus soma naturally has medicinal power also. It\r\nis medicine for a sick man, and the god Soma heals whatever is sick,\r\nmaking the blind to see and the lame to walk.\r\n\r\nSoma when imbibed stimulates the voice, which it impels as the rower\r\nhis boat. Soma also awakens eager thought, and the worshippers of the\r\ngod exclaim, \"We have drunk soma, we have become immortal, we have\r\nentered into light, we have known the gods.\" The intoxicating power\r\nof soma is chiefly, and very frequently, dwelt on in connection with\r\nIndra, whom it stimulates in his conflict with the hostile demons of\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nBeing the most important of herbs, soma is spoken of as lord of\r\nplants or their king, receiving also the epithet vanaspati, \"lord of\r\nthe forest.\"\r\n\r\nSoma is several times described as dwelling or growing on the\r\nmountains, in accordance with the statements of the Avesta about\r\nHaoma. Its true origin and abode is regarded as heaven, whence it has\r\nbeen brought down to earth. This belief is most frequently embodied in\r\nthe myth of the soma-bringing eagle (çyena), which is probably only\r\nthe mythological account of the simple phenomenon of the descent of\r\nlightning and the simultaneous fall of rain.\r\n\r\nIn some of the latest hymns of the Rigveda Soma begins to be somewhat\r\nobscurely identified with the moon. In the Atharva-veda Soma several\r\ntimes means the moon, and in the Yajurveda Soma is spoken of as having\r\nthe lunar mansions for his wives. The identification is a commonplace\r\nin the Brahmanas, which explain the waning of the moon as due to the\r\ngods and fathers eating up the ambrosia of which it consists. In one\r\nof the Upanishads, moreover, the statement occurs that the moon is\r\nKing Soma, the food of the gods, and is drunk up by them. Finally,\r\nin post-Vedic literature Soma is a regular name of the moon, which is\r\nregarded as being consumed by the gods, and consequently waning till\r\nit is filled up again by the sun. This somewhat remarkable coalescence\r\nof Soma with the moon doubtless sprang from the hyperbolical terms in\r\nwhich the poets of the Rigveda dwell on Soma's celestial nature and\r\nbrilliance, which they describe as dispelling darkness. They sometimes\r\nspeak of it as swelling in the waters, and often refer to the sap as\r\na \"drop\" (indu). Comparisons with the moon would thus easily suggest\r\nthemselves. In one passage of the Rigveda, for instance, Soma in the\r\nbowls is said to appear like the moon in the waters. The mystical\r\nspeculations with which the Soma poetry teems would soon complete\r\nthe symbolism.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the Avesta with the Rigveda shows clearly that soma\r\nwas already an important feature in the mythology and cult of the\r\nIndo-Iranian age. In both it is described as growing on the mountains,\r\nwhence it is brought by birds; in both it is king of plants; in both\r\na medicine bestowing long life and removing death. In both the sap\r\nwas pressed and mixed with milk; in both its mythical home is heaven,\r\nwhence it comes down to earth; in both the draught has become a mighty\r\ngod; in both the celestial Soma is distinguished from the terrestrial,\r\nthe god from the beverage. The similarity goes so far that Soma and\r\nHaoma have even some individual epithets in common.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of thought in the Rigvedic period shows a tendency to\r\nadvance from the concrete to the abstract. One result of this tendency\r\nis the creation of abstract deities, which, however, are still rare,\r\noccurring for the most part in the last book only. A few of them are\r\ndeifications of abstract nouns, such as Çraddha \"Faith,\" invoked in\r\none short hymn, and Manyu, \"Wrath,\" in two. These abstractions grow\r\nmore numerous in the later Vedas. Thus Kama, \"Desire,\" first appears\r\nin the Atharva-veda, where the arrows with which he pierces hearts\r\nare already referred to; he is the forerunner of the flower-arrowed\r\ngod of love, familiar in classical literature. More numerous is\r\nthe class of abstractions comprising deities whose names denote an\r\nagent, such as Dhatri, \"Creator,\" or an attribute, such as Prajapati,\r\n\"Lord of Creatures.\" These do not appear to be direct abstractions,\r\nbut seem to be derived from epithets designating a particular aspect\r\nof activity or character, which at first applying to one or more\r\nof the older deities, finally acquired an independent value. Thus\r\nPrajapati, originally an epithet of such gods as Savitri and Soma,\r\noccurs in a late verse of the last book as a distinct deity possessing\r\nthe attribute of a creator. This god is in the Atharva-veda and the\r\nVajasaneyi-Samhita often, and in the Brahmanas regularly, recognised\r\nas the chief deity, the father of the gods. In the Sutras, Prajapati\r\nis identified with Brahma, his successor in the post-Vedic age.\r\n\r\nA hymn of the tenth book furnishes an interesting illustration of the\r\ncurious way in which such abstractions sometimes come into being. Here\r\nis one of the stanzas:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    By whom the mighty sky, the earth so steadfast,\r\n    The realm of light, heaven's vault, has been established,\r\n    Who in the air the boundless space traverses:\r\n    What god should we with sacrifices worship?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth line here is the refrain of nine successive stanzas, in\r\nwhich the creator is referred to as unknown, with the interrogative\r\npronoun ka, \"what?\" This ka in the later Vedic literature came to be\r\nemployed not only as an epithet of the creator Prajapati, but even\r\nas an independent name of the supreme god.\r\n\r\nA deity of an abstract character occurring in the oldest as well as\r\nthe latest parts of the Rigveda is Brihaspati, \"Lord of Prayer.\" Roth\r\nand other distinguished Vedic scholars regard him as a direct\r\npersonification of devotion. In the opinion of the present writer,\r\nhowever, he is only an indirect deification of the sacrificial activity\r\nof Agni, a god with whom he has undoubtedly much in common. Thus\r\nthe most prominent feature of his character is his priesthood. Like\r\nAgni, he has been drawn into and has obtained a firm footing in the\r\nIndra myth. Thus he is often described as driving out the cows after\r\nvanquishing the demon Vala. As the divine brahma priest, Brihaspati\r\nseems to have been the prototype of the god Brahma, chief of the later\r\nHindu trinity. But the name Brihaspati itself survived in post-Vedic\r\nmythology as the designation of a sage, the teacher of the gods,\r\nand regent of the planet Jupiter.\r\n\r\nAnother abstraction, and one of a very peculiar kind, is the\r\ngoddess Aditi. Though not the subject of any separate hymn, she is\r\noften incidentally celebrated. She has two, and only two, prominent\r\ncharacteristics. She is, in the first place, the mother of the small\r\ngroup of gods called Adityas, of whom Varuna is the chief. Secondly,\r\nshe has, like her son Varuna, the power of releasing from the bonds\r\nof physical suffering and moral guilt. With the latter trait her\r\nname, which means \"unbinding,\" \"freedom,\" is clearly connected. The\r\nunpersonified sense seems to survive in a few passages of the\r\nRigveda. Thus a poet prays for the \"secure and unlimited gift of\r\naditi.\" The origin of the abstraction is probably to be explained\r\nas follows. The expression \"sons of Aditi,\" which is several times\r\napplied to the Adityas, when first used in all likelihood meant \"sons\r\nof liberation,\" to emphasise a salient trait of their character,\r\naccording to a turn of language common in the Rigveda. The feminine\r\nword \"liberation\" (aditi) used in this connection would then have\r\nbecome personified by a process which has more than one parallel in\r\nSanskrit. Thus Aditi, a goddess of Indian origin, is historically\r\nyounger than some at least of her sons, who can be traced back to a\r\npre-Indian age.\r\n\r\nGoddesses, as a whole, occupy a very subordinate position in Vedic\r\nbelief. They play hardly any part as rulers of the world. The only\r\none of any consequence is Ushas. The next in importance, Sarasvati,\r\nranks only with the least prominent of the male gods. One of the few,\r\nbesides Prithivi, to whom an entire hymn is addressed, is Ratri,\r\nNight. Like her sister Dawn, with whom she is often coupled, she\r\nis addressed as a daughter of the sky. She is conceived not as the\r\ndark, but as the bright starlit night. Thus, in contrasting the twin\r\ngoddesses, a poet says, \"One decks herself with stars, with sunlight\r\nthe other.\" The following stanzas are from the hymn addressed to Night\r\n(x. 127):--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Night coming on, the goddess shines\r\n    In many places with her eyes:\r\n    All-glorious she has decked herself.\r\n\r\n    Immortal goddess, far and wide\r\n    She fills the valleys and the heights:\r\n    Darkness with light she overcomes.\r\n\r\n    And now the goddess coming on\r\n    Has driven away her sister Dawn:\r\n    Far off the darkness hastes away.\r\n\r\n    Thus, goddess, come to us to-day,\r\n    At whose approach we seek our homes,\r\n    As birds upon the tree their nest.\r\n\r\n    The villagers have gone to rest,\r\n    Beasts, too, with feet and birds with wings:\r\n    The hungry hawk himself is still.\r\n\r\n    Ward off the she-wolf and the wolf,\r\n    Ward off the robber, goddess Night:\r\n    And take us safe across the gloom.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoddesses, as wives of the great gods, play a still more insignificant\r\npart, being entirely devoid of independent character. Indeed, hardly\r\nanything about them is mentioned but their names, which are simply\r\nformed from those of their male consorts by means of feminine suffixes.\r\n\r\nA peculiar feature of Vedic mythology is the invocation in couples\r\nof a number of deities whose names are combined in the form of dual\r\ncompounds. About a dozen such pairs are celebrated in entire hymns,\r\nand some half-dozen others in detached stanzas. By far the greatest\r\nnumber of such hymns is addressed to Mitra-Varuna, but the names\r\nmost often found combined in this way are those of Heaven and Earth\r\n(Dyavaprithivi). There can be little doubt that the latter couple\r\nfurnished the analogy for this favourite formation. For the association\r\nof this pair, traceable as far back as the Indo-European period,\r\nappeared to early thought so intimate in nature, that the myth of\r\ntheir conjugal union is found widely diffused among primitive peoples.\r\n\r\nBesides these pairs of deities there is a certain number of more\r\nor less definite groups of divine beings generally associated with\r\nsome particular god. The largest and most important of these are the\r\nMaruts or Storm-gods, who, as we have seen, constantly attend Indra\r\non his warlike exploits. The same group, under the name of Rudras,\r\nis occasionally associated with their father Rudra. The smaller group\r\nof the Adityas is constantly mentioned in company with their mother\r\nAditi, or their chief Varuna. Their number in two passages of the\r\nRigveda is stated as seven or eight, while in the Brahmanas and later\r\nit is regularly twelve. Some eight or ten hymns of the Rigveda are\r\naddressed to them collectively. The following lines are taken from one\r\n(viii. 47) in which their aid and protection is specially invoked:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    As birds extend their sheltering wings,\r\n    Spread your protection over us.\r\n\r\n    As charioteers avoid ill roads,\r\n    May dangers always pass us by.\r\n\r\n    Resting in you, O gods, we are\r\n    Like men that fight in coats of mail.\r\n\r\n    Look down on us, O Adityas,\r\n    Like spies observing from the bank:\r\n\r\n    Lead us to paths of pleasantness,\r\n    Like horses to an easy ford.\r\n\r\n\r\nA third and much less important group is that of the Vasus, mostly\r\nassociated with Indra in the Rigveda, though in later Vedic texts\r\nAgni becomes their leader. They are a vague group, for they are not\r\ncharacterised, having neither individual names nor any definite\r\nnumber. The Brahmanas, however, mention eight of them. Finally,\r\nthere are the Viçvedevas or All-gods, to whom some sixty hymns are\r\naddressed. It is a factitious sacrificial group meant to embrace the\r\nwhole pantheon in order that none should be excluded in invocations\r\nintended to be addressed to all. Strange to say, the All-gods are\r\nsometimes conceived as a narrower group, which is invoked with others\r\nlike the Vasus and Adityas.\r\n\r\nBesides the higher gods the Rigveda knows a number of mythical beings\r\nnot regarded as possessing the divine nature to the full extent and\r\nfrom the beginning. The most important of these are the Ribhus who\r\nform a triad, and are addressed in eleven hymns. Characteristically\r\ndeft-handed, they are often said to have acquired the rank of deities\r\nby their marvellous skill. Among the five great feats of dexterity\r\nwhereby they became gods, the greatest--in which they appear as\r\nsuccessful rivals of Tvashtri, the artificer god--consists in their\r\nhaving transformed his bowl, the drinking vessel of the gods, into four\r\nshining cups. This bowl perhaps represents the moon, the four cups\r\nbeing its phases. It has also been interpreted as the year with its\r\ndivision into seasons. The Ribhus are further said to have renewed\r\nthe youth of their parents, by whom Heaven and Earth seem to have\r\nbeen meant. With this miraculous deed another myth told about them\r\nappears to be specially connected. They rested for twelve days in the\r\nhouse of the sun, Agohya (\"who cannot be concealed\"). This sojourn\r\nof the Ribhus in the house of the sun in all probability alludes to\r\nthe winter solstice, the twelve days being the addition which was\r\nnecessary to bring the lunar year of 354 into harmony with the solar\r\nyear of nearly 366 days, and was intercalated before the days begin to\r\ngrow perceptibly longer. On the whole, it seems likely that the Ribhus\r\nwere originally terrestrial or aërial elves, whose dexterity gradually\r\nattracted to them various myths illustrative of marvellous skill.\r\n\r\nIn a few passages of the Rigveda mention is made of a celestial\r\nwater-nymph called Apsaras (\"moving in the waters\"), who is regarded\r\nas the spouse of a corresponding male genius called Gandharva. The\r\nApsaras, in the words of the poet, smiles at her beloved in the\r\nhighest heaven. More Apsarases than one are occasionally spoken\r\nof. Their abode is in the later Vedas extended to the earth, where\r\nthey especially frequent trees, which resound with the music of their\r\nlutes and cymbals. The Brahmanas describe them as distinguished by\r\ngreat beauty and devoted to dance, song, and play. In the post-Vedic\r\nperiod they become the courtesans of Indra's heaven. The Apsarases are\r\nloved not only by the Gandharvas but occasionally even by men. Such\r\nan one was Urvaçi. A dialogue between her and her earthly spouse,\r\nPururavas, is contained in a somewhat obscure hymn of the Rigveda\r\n(x. 95). The nymph is here made to say:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Among mortals in other form I wandered,\r\n    And dwelt for many nights throughout four autumns.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer lover implores her to return; but, though his request is refused,\r\nhe (like Tithonus) receives the promise of immortality. The Çatapatha\r\nBrahmana tells the story in a more connected and detailed form. Urvaçi\r\nis joined with Pururavas in an alliance, the permanence of which\r\ndepends on a condition. When this is broken by a stratagem of the\r\nGandharvas, the nymph immediately vanishes from the sight of her\r\nlover. Pururavas, distracted, roams in search of her, till at last\r\nhe observes her swimming in a lotus lake with other Apsarases in\r\nthe form of an aquatic bird. Urvaçi discovers herself to him, and\r\nin response to his entreaties, consents to return for once after the\r\nlapse of a year. This myth in the post-Vedic age furnished the theme\r\nof Kalidasa's play Vikramorvaçi.\r\n\r\nGandharva appears to have been conceived originally as a single\r\nbeing. For in the Rigveda the name nearly always occurs in the\r\nsingular, and in the Avesta, where it is found a few times in the\r\nform of Gandarewa, only in the singular. According to the Rigveda,\r\nthis genius, the lover of the water-nymph, dwells in the fathomless\r\nspaces of air, and stands erect on the vault of heaven. He is also a\r\nguardian of the celestial soma, and is sometimes, as in the Avesta,\r\nconnected with the waters. In the later Vedas the Gandharvas form\r\na class, their association with the Apsarases being so frequent as\r\nto amount to a stereotyped phrase. In the post-Vedic age they have\r\nbecome celestial singers, and the notion of their home being in the\r\nrealm of air survives in the expression \"City of the Gandharvas\"\r\nas one of the Sanskrit names for \"mirage.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous ancient priests and heroes of the Rigveda the most\r\nimportant is Manu, the first sacrificer and the ancestor of the human\r\nrace. The poets refer to him as \"our father,\" and speak of sacrificers\r\nas \"the people of Manu.\" The Çatapatha Brahmana makes Manu play the\r\npart of a Noah in the history of human descent.\r\n\r\nA group of ancient priests are the Angirases, who are closely\r\nassociated with Indra in the myth of the capture of the cows. Another\r\nancient race of mythical priests are the Bhrigus, to whom the Indian\r\nPrometheus, Matariçvan, brought the hidden Agni from heaven, and whose\r\nfunction was the establishment and diffusion of the sacrificial fire\r\non earth.\r\n\r\nA numerically definite group of ancestral priests, rarely mentioned in\r\nthe Rigveda, are the seven Rishis or seers. In the Brahmanas they came\r\nto be regarded as the seven stars in the constellation of the Great\r\nBear, and are said to have been bears in the beginning. This curious\r\nidentification was doubtless brought about partly by the sameness of\r\nthe number in the two cases, and partly by the similarity of sound\r\nbetween rishi, \"seer,\" and riksha, which in the Rigveda means both\r\n\"star\" and \"bear.\"\r\n\r\nAnimals play a considerable part in the mythological and religious\r\nconceptions of the Veda. Among them the horse is conspicuous as drawing\r\nthe cars of the gods, and in particular as representing the sun under\r\nvarious names. In the Vedic ritual the horse was regarded as symbolical\r\nof the sun and of fire. Two hymns of the Rigveda (i. 162-163) which\r\ndeal with the subject, further show that horse-sacrifice was practised\r\nin the earliest age of Indian antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe cow, however, is the animal which figures most largely in the\r\nRigveda. This is undoubtedly due to the important position, resulting\r\nfrom its pre-eminent utility, occupied by this animal even in the\r\nremotest period of Indian life. The beams of dawn and the clouds\r\nare cows. The rain-cloud, personified under the name of Priçni, \"the\r\nspeckled one,\" is a cow, the mother of the Storm-gods. The bountiful\r\nclouds on which all wealth in India depended, were doubtless the\r\nprototypes of the many-coloured cows which yield all desires in\r\nthe heaven of the blest described by the Atharva-veda, and which\r\nare the forerunners of the \"Cow of Plenty\" (Kamaduh) so familiar\r\nto post-Vedic poetry. The earth itself is often spoken of by the\r\npoets of the Rigveda as a cow. That this animal already possessed a\r\nsacred character is shown by the fact that one Rishi addresses a cow\r\nas Aditi and a goddess, impressing upon his hearers that she should\r\nnot be slain. Aghnya (\"not to be killed\"), a frequent designation\r\nof the cow in the Rigveda, points in the same direction. Indeed\r\nthe evidence of the Avesta proves that the sanctity of this animal\r\ngoes back even to the Indo-Iranian period. In the Atharva-veda the\r\nworship of the cow is fully recognised, while the Çatapatha Brahmana\r\nemphasises the evil consequences of eating beef. The sanctity of the\r\ncow has not only survived in India down to the present day, but has\r\neven gathered strength with the lapse of time. The part played by the\r\ngreased cartridges in the Indian Mutiny is sufficient to prove this\r\nstatement. To no other animal has mankind owed so much, and the debt\r\nhas been richly repaid in India with a veneration unknown in other\r\nlands. So important a factor has the cow proved in Indian life and\r\nthought, that an exhaustive account of her influence from the earliest\r\ntimes would form a noteworthy chapter in the history of civilisation.\r\n\r\nAmong the noxious animals of the Rigveda the serpent is the most\r\nprominent. This is the form which the powerful demon, the foe of Indra,\r\nis believed to possess. The serpent also appears as a divine being\r\nin the form of the rarely mentioned Ahi budhnya, \"the Dragon of the\r\nDeep,\" supposed to dwell in the fathomless depths of the aërial ocean,\r\nand probably representing the beneficent side of the character of\r\nthe serpent Vritra. In the later Vedas the serpents are mentioned as\r\na class of semi-divine beings along with the Gandharvas and others;\r\nand in the Sutras offerings to them are prescribed. In the latter\r\nworks we meet for the first time with the Nagas, in reality serpents,\r\nand human only in form. In post-Vedic times serpent-worship is found\r\nall over India. Since there is no trace of it in the Rigveda, while it\r\nprevails widely among the non-Aryan Indians, there is reason to believe\r\nthat when the Aryans spread over India, the land of serpents, they\r\nfound the cult diffused among the aborigines and borrowed it from them.\r\n\r\nPlants are frequently invoked as divinities, chiefly in enumerations\r\nalong with waters, rivers, mountains, heaven, and earth. One entire\r\nhymn (x. 97) is, however, devoted to the praise of plants (oshadhi)\r\nalone, mainly with regard to their healing powers. Later Vedic\r\ntexts mention offerings made to plants and the adoration paid to\r\nlarge trees passed in marriage processions. One hymn of the Rigveda\r\n(x. 146) celebrates the forest as a whole, personified as Aranyani,\r\nthe mocking genius of the woods. The weird sights and sounds of the\r\ngloaming are here described with a fine perception of nature. In the\r\ndark solitudes of the jungle\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sounds as of grazing cows are heard,\r\n    A dwelling-house appears to loom,\r\n    And Aranyani, Forest-nymph,\r\n    Creaks like a cart at eventide.\r\n\r\n    Here some one calls his cow to him,\r\n    Another there is felling wood;\r\n    Who tarries in the forest-glade\r\n    Thinks to himself, \"I heard a cry.\"\r\n\r\n    Never does Aranyani hurt\r\n    Unless one goes too near to her:\r\n    When she has eaten of sweet fruit\r\n    At her own will she goes to rest.\r\n\r\n    Sweet-scented, redolent of balm,\r\n    Replete with food, yet tilling not,\r\n    Mother of beasts, the Forest-nymph,\r\n    Her I have magnified with praise.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, the part played by plant, tree, and forest\r\ndeities is a very insignificant one in the Rigveda.\r\n\r\nA strange religious feature pointing to a remote antiquity is the\r\noccasional deification and worship even of objects fashioned by\r\nthe hand of man, when regarded as useful to him. These are chiefly\r\nsacrificial implements. Thus in one hymn (iii. 8) the sacrificial post\r\n(called \"lord of the forest\") is invoked, while three hymns of the\r\ntenth book celebrate the pressing stones used in preparing soma. The\r\nplough is invoked in a few stanzas; and an entire hymn (vi. 75) is\r\ndevoted to the praise of various implements of war, while one in the\r\nAtharva-veda (v. 20) glorifies the drum.\r\n\r\nThe demons so frequently mentioned in the Rigveda are of two\r\nclasses. The one consists of the aërial adversaries of the gods. The\r\nolder view is that of a conflict waged between a single god and a\r\nsingle demon. This gradually developed into the notion of the gods and\r\nthe demons in general being arrayed against each other as two opposing\r\nhosts. The Brahmanas regularly represent the antagonism thus. Asura\r\nis the ordinary name of the aërial foes of the gods. This word has a\r\nremarkable history. In the Rigveda it is predominantly a designation\r\nof the gods, and in the Avesta it denotes, in the form of Ahura, the\r\nhighest god of Zoroastrianism. In the later parts of the Rigveda,\r\nhowever, asura, when used by itself, also signifies \"demon,\" and\r\nthis is its only sense in the Atharva-veda. A somewhat unsuccessful\r\nattempt has been made to explain how a word signifying \"god\" came\r\nto mean \"devil,\" as the result of national conflicts, the Asuras or\r\ngods of extra-Vedic tribes becoming demons to the Vedic Indian, just\r\nas the devas or gods of the Veda are demons in the Avesta. There is\r\nno traditional evidence in support of this view, and it is opposed\r\nby the fact that to the Rigvedic Indian asura not only in general\r\nmeant a divine being, but was especially appropriate to Varuna, the\r\nmost exalted of the gods. The word must therefore have changed its\r\nmeaning in course of time within the Veda itself. Here it seems from\r\nthe beginning to have had the sense of \"possessor of occult power,\"\r\nand hence to have been potentially applicable to hostile beings. Thus\r\nin one hymn of the Rigveda (x. 124) both senses seem to occur. Towards\r\nthe end of the Rigvedic period the application of the word to the\r\ngods began to fall into abeyance. This tendency was in all likelihood\r\naccelerated by the need of a word denoting the hostile demoniac powers\r\ngenerally, as well as by an incipient popular etymology, which saw\r\na negative (a-sura) in the word and led to the invention of sura,\r\n\"god,\" a term first found in the Upanishads.\r\n\r\nA group of aërial demons, primarily foes of Indra, are the Panis. The\r\nproper meaning of the word is \"niggard,\" especially in regard\r\nto sacrificial gifts. From this signification it developed the\r\nmythological sense of demons resembling those originally conceived\r\nas withholding the treasures of heaven. The term dasa or dasyu,\r\nproperly the designation of the dark aborigines of India contrasted\r\nwith their fair Aryan conquerors, is frequently used in the sense of\r\ndemons or fiends.\r\n\r\nBy far the most conspicuous of the individual aërial demons of the\r\nRigveda, is Vritra, who has the form of a serpent, and whose name means\r\n\"encompasser.\" Another demon mentioned with some frequency is Vala,\r\nthe personification of the mythical cave in which the celestial cows\r\nare confined. In post-Vedic literature these two demons are frequently\r\nmentioned together and are regarded as brothers slain by Indra. The\r\nmost often named among the remaining adversaries of Indra is Çushna,\r\nthe \"hisser\" or \"scorcher.\" A rarely-mentioned demon is Svarbhanu,\r\nwho is described as eclipsing the sun with darkness. His successor\r\nin Sanskrit literature was Rahu, regarded as causing eclipses by\r\nswallowing the sun or moon.\r\n\r\nThe second class of demons consists of goblins supposed to infest the\r\nearth, enemies of mankind as the Asuras are of the gods. By far the\r\nmost common generic name for this class is Rakshas. They are hardly\r\never mentioned except in connection with some god who is invoked\r\nto destroy or is praised for having destroyed them. These goblins\r\nare conceived as having the shapes of various animals as well as of\r\nmen. Their appearance is more fully described by the Atharvaveda,\r\nin which they are also spoken of as deformed or as being blue,\r\nyellow, or green in colour. According to the Rigveda they are fond\r\nof the flesh of men and horses, whom they attack by entering into\r\nthem in order to satisfy their greed. They are supposed to prowl\r\nabout at night and to make the sacrifice the special object of their\r\nattacks. The belief that the Rakshases actively interfere with the\r\nperformance of sacrificial rites remains familiar in the post-Vedic\r\nperiod. A species of goblin scarcely referred to in the Rigveda,\r\nbut often mentioned in the later Vedas, are the Piçachas, described\r\nas devouring corpses and closely connected with the dead.\r\n\r\nFew references to death and the future life are to be found in the\r\nhymns of the Rigveda, as the optimistic and active Vedic Indian,\r\nunlike his descendants in later centuries, seems to have given little\r\nthought to the other world. Most of the information to be gained about\r\ntheir views of the next life are to be found in the funeral hymns of\r\nthe last book. The belief here expressed is that fire or the grave\r\ndestroys the body only, while the real personality of the deceased\r\nis imperishable. The soul is thought to be separable from the body,\r\nnot only after death, but even during unconsciousness (x. 58). There\r\nis no indication here, or even in the later Vedas, of the doctrine of\r\nthe transmigration of souls, though it was already firmly established\r\nin the sixth century B.C. when Buddhism arose. One passage of the\r\nRigveda, however, in which the soul is spoken of as departing to the\r\nwaters or the plants, may contain the germs of the theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHY OF THE RIGVEDA\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the Vedic view, the spirit of the deceased proceeded to\r\nthe realm of eternal light on the path trodden by the fathers, whom\r\nhe finds in the highest heaven revelling with Yama, king of the dead,\r\nand feasting with the gods.\r\n\r\nIn one of the funeral hymns (x. 14, 7) the dead man is thus\r\naddressed:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Go forth, go forth along those ancient pathways\r\n    To where our early ancestors departed.\r\n    There thou shalt see rejoicing in libations\r\n    The two kings, Varuna the god and Yama.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere a tree spreads its branches, in the shade of which Yama drinks\r\nsoma with the gods, and the sound of the flute and of songs is\r\nheard. The life in heaven is free from imperfections or bodily\r\nfrailties, and is altogether delectable. It is a glorified life\r\nof material joys as conceived by the imagination, not of warriors,\r\nbut of priests. Heaven is gained as a reward by heroes who risk their\r\nlives in battle, but above all by those who bestow liberal sacrificial\r\ngifts on priests.\r\n\r\nThough the Atharva-veda undoubtedly shows a belief in a place of\r\nfuture punishment, the utmost that can be inferred with regard to\r\nthe Rigveda from the scanty evidence we possess, is the notion that\r\nunbelievers were consigned to an underground darkness after death. So\r\nlittle, indeed, do the Rishis say on this subject, and so vague is\r\nthe little they do say, that Roth held the total annihilation of the\r\nwicked by death to be their belief. The early Indian notions about\r\nfuture punishment gradually developed, till, in the post-Vedic period,\r\na complicated system of hells had been elaborated.\r\n\r\nSome passages of the Rigveda distinguish the path of the fathers or\r\ndead ancestors from the path of the gods, doubtless because cremation\r\nappeared as a different process from sacrifice. In the Brahmanas the\r\nfathers and the gods are thought to dwell in distinct abodes, for the\r\n\"heavenly world\" is contrasted with the \"world of the fathers.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief of the blessed dead is Yama, to whom three entire hymns\r\nare addressed. He is spoken of as a king who rules the departed and\r\nas a gatherer of the people, who gives the deceased a resting-place\r\nand prepares an abode for him. Yama it was who first discovered the\r\nway to the other world:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Him who along the mighty heights departed,\r\n    Him who searched and spied out the path for many,\r\n    Son of Vivasvat, gatherer of the people,\r\n    Yama the king, with sacrifices worship. (x. 14, 1).\r\n\r\n\r\nThough death is the path of Yama, and he must consequently have been\r\nregarded with a certain amount of fear, he is not yet in the Rigveda,\r\nas in the Atharvaveda and the later mythology, a god of death. The\r\nowl and pigeon are occasionally mentioned as emissaries of Yama, but\r\nhis regular messengers are two dogs which guard the path trodden by\r\nthe dead proceeding to the other world.\r\n\r\nWith reference to them the deceased man is thus addressed in one of\r\nthe funeral hymns (x. 14):--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Run on thy path straight forward past the two dogs,\r\n    The sons of Sarama, four-eyed and brindled,\r\n    Draw near thereafter to the bounteous fathers,\r\n    Who revel on in company with Yama.\r\n\r\n    Broad-nosed and brown, the messengers of Yama,\r\n    Greedy of lives, wander among the people:\r\n    May they give back to us a life auspicious\r\n    Here and to-day, that we may see the sunlight.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Yama is sometimes used in the Rigveda in its primary\r\nsense of \"twin,\" and the chief of the dead actually occurs in this\r\ncharacter throughout a hymn (x. 10) of much poetic beauty, consisting\r\nof a dialogue between him and his sister Yami. She endeavours to win\r\nhis love, but he repels her advances with these words:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The spies sent by the gods here ever wander,\r\n    They stand not still, nor close their eyes in slumber:\r\n    Another man thine arms shall clasp, O Yami,\r\n    Tightly as twines around the tree the creeper.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe incestuous union which forms the main theme of the poem, though\r\nrejected as contrary to the higher ethical standard of the Rigveda,\r\nwas doubtless the survival of an already existing myth of the descent\r\nof mankind from primeval \"twins.\" This myth, indeed, seems to have\r\nbeen handed down from the Indo-Iranian period, for the later Avestan\r\nliterature makes mention of Yimeh as a sister of Yima. Even the name\r\nof Yama's father goes back to that period, for Yima is the son of\r\nVivanhvant in the Avesta as Yama is of Vivasvat in the Rigveda.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the Rigvedic poems comprises invocations of gods\r\nor deified objects as described in the foregoing pages. Scattered\r\namong them are to be found, chiefly in the tenth book, about a\r\ndozen mythological pieces consisting of dialogues which, in a vague\r\nand fragmentary way, indicate the course of the action and refer to\r\npast events. In all likelihood they were originally accompanied by a\r\nnarrative setting in prose, which explained the situation more fully\r\nto the audience, but was lost after these poems were incorporated\r\namong the collected hymns of the Rigveda. One of this class (iv. 42)\r\nis a colloquy between Indra and Varuna, in which each of these\r\nleading gods puts forward his claims to pre-eminence. Another, which\r\nshows considerable poetic merit and presents the situation clearly,\r\nis a dialogue in alternate verses between Varuna and Agni (x. 51),\r\nfollowed by a second (x. 52) between the gods and Agni, who has grown\r\nweary of his sacrificial office, but finally agrees to continue the\r\nperformance of his duties.\r\n\r\nA curious but prosaic and obscure hymn (x. 86), consists of a dialogue\r\nbetween Indra and his wife Indrani on the subject of a monkey which\r\nhas incurred the anger of the latter. The circumstances are much more\r\nclearly presented in a poem of great beauty (x. 108), in which Sarama,\r\nthe messenger of Indra, having tracked the stolen cows, demands them\r\nback from the Panis. Another already referred to (p. 107) treats\r\nthe myth of Urvaçi and Pururavas. The dialogue takes place at the\r\nmoment when the nymph is about to quit her mortal lover for ever. A\r\ngood deal of interest attaches to this myth, not only as the oldest\r\nIndo-European love-story, but as one which has had a long history in\r\nIndian literature. The dialogue of Yama and Yami (x. 10) is, as we\r\nhave seen, based on a still older myth. These mythological ballads,\r\nif I may use the expression, foreshadow the dramatic and epic poetry\r\nof a later age.\r\n\r\nA very small number, hardly more than thirty altogether, of the\r\nhymns of the Rigveda are not addressed to the gods or deified\r\nobjects. About a dozen poems, occurring almost exclusively in the\r\ntenth book, are concerned with magical notions, and therefore belong\r\nrather to the domain of the Atharva-veda, Two short ones (ii. 42-43)\r\nbelong to the sphere of augury, certain birds of omen being invoked\r\nto utter auspicious cries. Two others consist of spells directed\r\nagainst poisonous vermin (i. 191), and the disease called yakshma\r\n(x. 163). Two are incantations to preserve the life of one lying at\r\nthe point of death (x. 58; 60, 7-12). A couple of stanzas from one\r\nof the latter may serve as a specimen:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Just as a yoke with leathern thong\r\n    They fasten on that it may hold:\r\n    So have I now held fast thy soul,\r\n    That thou mayst live and mayst not die,\r\n    Anon to be unhurt and well.\r\n\r\n    Downward is blown the blast of wind,\r\n    Downward the burning sunbeams shoot,\r\n    Adown the milk streams from the cow:\r\n    So downward may thy ailment go.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a stanza from a poem intended as a charm to induce slumber\r\n(v. 55):--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The man who sits and he who walks,\r\n    And he who sees us with his gaze:\r\n    Of these we now close up the eyes,\r\n    Just as we shut this dwelling-house.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first three stanzas of this lullaby end with the refrain, \"Fall\r\nfast asleep\" (ni shu shvapa).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of one incantation (x. 183) is to procure children,\r\nwhile another (x. 162) is directed against the demon that destroys\r\noffspring. There is also a spell (x. 166) aiming at the destruction of\r\nenemies. We further find the incantation (x. 145) of a woman desiring\r\nto oust her rival wives from the affections of her husband. A sequel to\r\nit is formed by the song of triumph (x. 159) of one who has succeeded\r\nin this object:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Up has arisen there the sun,\r\n    So too my fortunes now arise:\r\n    With craft victorious I have gained\r\n    Over my lord this victory.\r\n\r\n    My sons now mighty warriors are,\r\n    My daughter is a princess now,\r\n    And I myself have gained the day:\r\n    My name stands highest with my lord.\r\n\r\n    Vanquished have I these rival wives,\r\n    Rising superior to them all,\r\n    That over this heroic man\r\n    And all this people I may rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to a late hymn (vii. 103), which is entirely secular in\r\nstyle, there is some doubt as to its original purpose. The awakening\r\nof the frogs at the beginning of the rainy season is here described\r\nwith a graphic power which will doubtless be appreciated best by those\r\nwho have lived in India. The poet compares the din of their croaking\r\nwith the chants of priests exhilarated by soma, and with the clamour\r\nof pupils at school repeating the words of their teacher:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Resting in silence for a year,\r\n    As Brahmans practising a vow,\r\n    The frogs have lifted up their voice,\r\n    Excited when Parjanya comes.\r\n\r\n    When one repeats the utterance of the other\r\n    Like those who learn the lesson of their teacher,\r\n    Then every limb of yours seems to be swelling,\r\n    As eloquent ye prate upon the waters.\r\n\r\n    As Brahmans at the mighty soma offering\r\n    Sit round the large and brimming vessel talking,\r\n    So throng ye round the pool to hallow\r\n    This day of all the year that brings the rain-time.\r\n\r\n    These Brahmans with their soma raise their voices,\r\n    Performing punctually their yearly worship;\r\n    And these Adhvaryus, sweating with their kettles,\r\n    These priests come forth to view, and none are hidden.\r\n\r\n    The twelvemonth's god-sent order they have guarded,\r\n    And never do these men neglect the season.\r\n    When in the year the rainy time commences,\r\n    Those who were heated kettles gain deliverance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis poem has usually been interpreted as a satire upon the\r\nBrahmans. If such be indeed its purport, we find it difficult to\r\nconceive how it could have gained admittance into a collection\r\nlike the Rigveda, which, if not entirely composed, was certainly\r\nedited, by priests. The Brahmans cannot have been ignorant of the\r\nreal significance of the poem. On the other hand, the comparison of\r\nfrogs with Brahmans would not necessarily imply satire to the Vedic\r\nIndian. Students familiar with the style of the Rigveda know that\r\nmany similes which, if used by ourselves, would involve contempt\r\nor ridicule, were employed by the ancient Indian poets only for the\r\nsake of graphic effect. As the frogs are in the last stanza besought\r\nto grant wealth and length of days, it is much more likely that we\r\nhave here a panegyric of frogs believed to have the magical power of\r\nbringing rain.\r\n\r\nThere remain about twenty poems the subject-matter of which is of a\r\nmore or less secular character. They deal with social customs, the\r\nliberality of patrons, ethical questions, riddles, and cosmogonic\r\nspeculations. Several of them are of high importance for the history\r\nof Indian thought and civilisation. As social usages have always been\r\ndominated by religion in India, it is natural that the poems dealing\r\nwith them should have a religious and mythological colouring. The\r\nmost notable poem of this kind is the long wedding-hymn (x. 85) of\r\nforty-seven stanzas. Lacking in poetic unity, it consists of groups of\r\nverses relating to the marriage ceremonial loosely strung together. The\r\nopening stanzas (1-5), in which the identity of the celestial soma\r\nand of the moon is expressed in veiled terms, are followed by others\r\n(6-17) relating the myth of the wedding of Soma the moon with the\r\nsun-maiden Surya. The Açvins, elsewhere her spouses, here appear in\r\nthe inferior capacity of groomsmen, who, on behalf of Soma, sue for\r\nthe hand of Surya from her father, the sun-god. Savitri consents,\r\nand sends his daughter, a willing bride, to her husband's house on a\r\ntwo-wheeled car made of the wood of the çalmali or silk-cotton tree,\r\ndecked with red kimçuka flowers, and drawn by two white bulls.\r\n\r\nThen sun and moon, the prototype of human marriage, are described as\r\nan inseparable pair (18-19):--\r\n\r\n\r\n    They move alternately with mystic power;\r\n    Like children playing they go round the sacrifice:\r\n    One of the two surveys all living beings,\r\n    The other, seasons meting out, is born again.\r\n\r\n    Ever anew, being born again, he rises,\r\n    He goes in front of dawns as daylight's token.\r\n    He, coming, to the gods their share apportions:\r\n    The moon extends the length of man's existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlessings are then invoked on the wedding procession, and a wish\r\nexpressed that the newly-married couple may have many children and\r\nenjoy prosperity, long life, and freedom from disease (20-33).\r\n\r\nThe next two stanzas (34-35), containing some obscure references to\r\nthe bridal garments, are followed by six others (36-41) pronounced\r\nat the wedding rite, which is again brought into connection with the\r\nmarriage of Surya. The bridegroom here thus addresses the bride:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    I grasp thy hand that I may gain good fortune,\r\n    That thou may'st reach old age with me thy husband.\r\n    Bhaga, Aryaman, Savitri, Puramdhi,\r\n    The gods have given thee to share my household.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe god of fire is at the same time invoked:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    To thee, O Agni, first they led\r\n    Bright Surya with the bridal throng:\r\n    So in thy turn to husbands give\r\n    A wife along with progeny.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concluding verses (42-47) are benedictions pronounced on the\r\nnewly-wedded couple after the bride has arrived at her future home:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here abide; be not divided;\r\n    Complete life's whole allotted span,\r\n    Playing with your sons and grandsons,\r\n    Rejoicing in your own abode.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last stanza of all is spoken by the bridegroom:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    May all the gods us two unite,\r\n    May Waters now our hearts entwine;\r\n    May Matariçvan and Dhatri,\r\n    May Deshtri us together join.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are five hymns, all in the last book (x. 14-18), which are more\r\nor less concerned with funeral rites. All but one of them, however,\r\nconsist chiefly of invocations of gods connected with the future\r\nlife. The first (14) is addressed to Yama, the next to the Fathers,\r\nthe third to Agni, and the fourth to Pushan, as well as Sarasvati. Only\r\nthe last (18) is a funeral hymn in the true sense. It is secular in\r\nstyle as well as in matter, being almost free from references to any\r\nof the gods. Grave and elevated in tone, it is distinguished by great\r\nbeauty of language. It also yields more information about the funeral\r\nusages of those early days than any of the rest.\r\n\r\nFrom this group of hymns it appears that burial was practised as well\r\nas cremation by the Vedic Indians. The composer of a hymn addressed to\r\nVaruna in Book VII. also mentions \"the house of clay\" in connection\r\nwith death. Cremation was, however, the usual manner of disposing of\r\nthe dead, and the later Vedic ritual practically knew this method\r\nalone, sanctioning only the burial of ascetics and children under\r\ntwo years of age. With the rite of cremation, too, the mythological\r\nnotions about the future life were specially connected. Thus Agni\r\nconducts the corpse to the other world, where the gods and Fathers\r\ndwell. A goat was sacrificed when the corpse was burned, and this\r\ngoat, according to the Atharva-veda (ix. 5, 1 and 3), preceded and\r\nannounced the deceased to the fathers, just as in the Rigveda the\r\ngoat immolated with the sacrificial horse goes before to announce\r\nthe offering to the gods (i. 162-163). In the later Vedic ritual a\r\ngoat or cow was sacrificed as the body was cremated.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with a custom of remotest antiquity still surviving\r\nin India, the dead man was provided with ornaments and clothing for\r\nuse in the future life. The fact that in the funeral obsequies of the\r\nRigveda the widow lies down beside the body of her deceased husband and\r\nhis bow is removed from the dead man's hand, shows that both were in\r\nearlier times burnt with his body to accompany him to the next world,\r\nand a verse of the Atharva-veda calls the dying of the widow with her\r\nhusband an old custom. The evidence of anthropology shows that this was\r\na very primitive practice widely prevailing at the funerals of military\r\nchiefs, and it can be proved to go back to the Indo-European age.\r\n\r\nThe following stanza (8) from the last funeral hymn (x. 18) is\r\naddressed to the widow, who is called upon to rise from the pyre and\r\ntake the hand of her new husband, doubtless a brother of the deceased,\r\nin accordance with an ancient marriage custom:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rise up; come to the world of life; O woman;\r\n    Thou liest here by one whose soul has left him.\r\n    Come: thou hast now entered upon the wifehood\r\n    Of this thy lord who takes thy hand and woos thee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe speaker then, turning to the deceased man, exclaims:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    From the dead hand I take the bow he wielded,\r\n    To gain for us dominion, might, and glory.\r\n    Thou there, we here, rich in heroic offspring,\r\n    Will vanquish all assaults of every foeman.\r\n\r\n    Approach the bosom of the earth, the mother,\r\n    This earth extending far and most propitious:\r\n    Young, soft as wool to bounteous givers, may she\r\n    Preserve thee from the lap of dissolution.\r\n\r\n    Open wide, O earth, press not heavily on him,\r\n    Be easy of approach, hail him with kindly aid;\r\n    As with a robe a mother hides\r\n    Her son, so shroud this man, O earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferring to the bystanders he continues:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    These living ones are from the dead divided:\r\n    Our calling on the gods is now auspicious.\r\n    We have come forth prepared for dance and laughter,\r\n    Till future days prolonging our existence.\r\n\r\n    As days in order follow one another,\r\n    As seasons duly alternate with seasons;\r\n    As the later never forsakes the earlier,\r\n    So fashion thou the lives of these, Ordainer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few of the secular poems contain various historical references. These\r\nare the so-called Danastutis or \"Praises of Gifts,\" panegyrics\r\ncommemorating the liberality of princes towards the priestly singers\r\nemployed by them. They possess little poetic merit, and are of late\r\ndate, occurring chiefly in the first and tenth books, or among the\r\nValakhilya (supplementary) hymns of the eighth. A number of encomia\r\nof this type, generally consisting of only two or three stanzas, are\r\nappended to ordinary hymns in the eighth book and, much less commonly,\r\nin most of the other books. Chiefly concerned in describing the kind\r\nand the amount of the gifts bestowed on them, the composers of these\r\npanegyrics incidentally furnish historical data about the families and\r\ngenealogies of themselves and their patrons, as well as about the names\r\nand homes of the Vedic tribes. The amount of the presents bestowed--for\r\ninstance, 60,000 cows--is sometimes enormously exaggerated. We may,\r\nhowever, safely conclude that it was often considerable, and that\r\nthe Vedic chiefs possessed very large herds of cattle.\r\n\r\nFour of the secular poems are didactic in character. One of\r\nthese (x. 34), \"The Lament of the Gambler,\" strikes a pathetic\r\nnote. Considering that it is the oldest composition of the kind\r\nin existence, we cannot but regard this poem as a most remarkable\r\nliterary product. The gambler deplores his inability to throw off\r\nthe spell of the dice, though he sees the ruin they are bringing on\r\nhim and his household:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Downward they fall, then nimbly leaping upward,\r\n    They overpower the man with hands, though handless.\r\n    Cast on the board like magic bits of charcoal,\r\n    Though cold themselves, they burn the heart to ashes.\r\n\r\n    It pains the gambler when he sees a woman,\r\n    Another's wife, and their well-ordered household:\r\n    He yokes these brown steeds early in the morning,\r\n    And, when the fire is low, sinks down an outcast.\r\n\r\n    \"Play not with dice, but cultivate thy cornfield;\r\n    Rejoice in thy goods, deeming them abundant:\r\n    There are thy cows, there is thy wife, O gambler.\"\r\n    This counsel Savitri the kindly gives me.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe learn here that the dice (aksha) were made of the nut of the\r\nVibhidaka tree (Terminalia bellerica), which is still used for the\r\npurpose in India.\r\n\r\nThe other three poems of this group may be regarded as the forerunners\r\nof the sententious poetry which flourished so luxuriantly in Sanskrit\r\nliterature. One of them, consisting only of four stanzas (ix. 112),\r\ndescribes in a moralising strain of mild humour how men follow after\r\ngain in various ways:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The thoughts of men are manifold,\r\n    Their callings are of diverse kinds:\r\n    The carpenter desires a rift,\r\n    The leech a fracture wants to cure.\r\n\r\n    A poet I; my dad's a leech;\r\n    Mama the upper millstone grinds:\r\n    With various minds we strive for wealth,\r\n    As ever seeking after kine.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother of these poems (x. 117) consists of a collection of maxims\r\ninculcating the duty of well-doing and charity:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who has the power should give unto the needy,\r\n    Regarding well the course of life hereafter:\r\n    Fortune, like two chariot wheels revolving,\r\n    Now to one man comes nigh, now to another.\r\n\r\n    Ploughing the soil, the share produces nurture;\r\n    He who bestirs his feet performs his journey;\r\n    A priest who speaks earns more than one who's silent;\r\n    A friend who gives is better than the niggard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth of these poems (x. 71) is composed in praise of wise\r\nspeech. Here are four of its eleven stanzas:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Where clever men their words with wisdom utter,\r\n    And sift them as with flail the corn is winnowed,\r\n    There friends may recognise each other's friendship:\r\n    A goodly stamp is on their speech imprinted.\r\n\r\n    Whoever his congenial friend abandons,\r\n    In that man's speech there is not any blessing.\r\n    For what he hears he hears without advantage:\r\n    He has no knowledge of the path of virtue.\r\n\r\n    When Brahman friends unite to offer worship,\r\n    In hymns by the heart's impulse swiftly fashioned,\r\n    Then not a few are left behind in wisdom,\r\n    While others win their way as gifted Brahmans.\r\n\r\n    The one sits putting forth rich bloom of verses,\r\n    Another sings a song in skilful numbers,\r\n    A third as teacher states the laws of being,\r\n    A fourth metes out the sacrifice's measure.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in the ordinary hymns are to be found a few moralising remarks of\r\na cynical nature about wealth and women, such as frequently occur in\r\nthe ethical literature of the post-Vedic age. Thus one poet exclaims:\r\n\"How many a maiden is an object of affection to her wooer for the\r\nsake of her admirable wealth!\" (x. 27, 12); while another addresses\r\nthe kine he desires with the words: \"Ye cows make even the lean\r\nman fat, even the ugly man ye make of goodly countenance\" (vi. 28,\r\n6). A third observes: \"Indra himself said this, 'The mind of woman\r\nis hard to instruct, and her intelligence is small'\" (viii. 33, 17);\r\nand a fourth complains: \"There are no friendships with women; their\r\nhearts are those of hyenas\" (x. 95, 15). One, however, admits that\r\n\"many a woman is better than the godless and niggardly man\" (v. 61, 6).\r\n\r\nAllied to the didactic poems are the riddles, of which there are at\r\nleast two collections in the Rigveda. In their simplest form they are\r\nfound in a poem (29) of the eighth book. In each of its ten stanzas a\r\ndifferent deity is described by his characteristic marks, but without\r\nbeing mentioned, the hearer being left to guess his name. Vishnu,\r\nfor instance, is thus alluded to:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Another with his mighty stride has made three steps\r\n    To where the gods rejoice in bliss.\r\n\r\n\r\nA far more difficult collection, consisting of fifty-two stanzas,\r\noccurs in the first book (164). Nothing here is directly described, the\r\nlanguage being always symbolical and mystical. The allusions in several\r\ncases are so obscurely expressed that it is now impossible to divine\r\nthe meaning. Sometimes the riddle is put in the form of a question,\r\nand in one case the answer itself is also given. Occasionally the poet\r\npropounds a riddle of which he himself evidently does not know the\r\nsolution. In general these problems are stated as enigmas. The subject\r\nof about one-fourth of them is the sun. Six or seven deal with clouds,\r\nlightning, and the production of rain; three or four with Agni and his\r\nvarious forms; about the same number with the year and its divisions;\r\ntwo with the origin of the world and the One Being. The dawn, heaven\r\nand earth, the metres, speech, and some other subjects which can\r\nhardly even be conjectured, are dealt with in one or two stanzas\r\nrespectively. One of the more clearly expressed of these enigmas is\r\nthe following, which treats of the wheel of the year with its twelve\r\nmonths and three hundred and sixty days:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Provided with twelve spokes and undecaying,\r\n    The wheel of order rolls around the heavens;\r\n    Within it stand, O Agni, joined in couples,\r\n    Together seven hundred sons and twenty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth or intercalary month, contrasted with the twelve\r\nothers conceived as pairs, is thus darkly alluded to: \"Of the co-born\r\nthey call the seventh single-born; sages call the six twin pairs\r\ngod-born.\" The latter expression probably alludes to the intercalary\r\nmonth being an artificial creation of man. In the later Vedic age\r\nit became a practice to propound such enigmas, called \"theological\r\nproblems\" (brahmodya), in contests for intellectual pre-eminence\r\nwhen kings instituted great sacrifices or Brahmans were otherwise\r\nassembled together.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to these poetical riddles is the philosophical poetry\r\ncontained in the six or seven cosmogonic hymns of the Rigveda. The\r\nquestion of the origin of the world here treated is of course largely\r\nmixed with mythological and theological notions. Though betraying much\r\nconfusion of ideas, these early speculations are of great interest as\r\nthe sources from which flow various streams of later thought. Most\r\nof these hymns handle the subject of the origin of the world in a\r\ntheological, and only one in a purely philosophical spirit. In the\r\nview of the older Rishis, the gods in general, or various individual\r\ndeities, \"generated\" the world. This view conflicts with the frequently\r\nexpressed notion that heaven and earth are the parents of the gods. The\r\npoets thus involve themselves in the paradox that the children\r\nproduce their own parents. Indra, for instance, is described in so\r\nmany words as having begotten his father and mother from his own body\r\n(x. 54, 3). This conceit evidently pleased the fancy of a priesthood\r\nbecoming more and more addicted to far-fetched speculations; for in\r\nthe cosmogonic hymns we find reciprocal generation more than once\r\nintroduced in the stages of creation. Thus Daksha is said to have\r\nsprung from Aditi, and Aditi from Daksha (x. 72, 4).\r\n\r\nThe evolution of religious thought in the Rigveda led to the conception\r\nof a creator distinct from any of the chief deities and superior to all\r\nthe gods. He appears under the various names of Purusha, Viçvakarman,\r\nHiranyagarbha, or Prajapati in the cosmogonic hymns. Whereas creation,\r\naccording to the earlier view, is regularly referred to as an act of\r\nnatural generation with some form of the verb jan, \"to beget,\" these\r\ncosmogonic poems speak of it as the manufacture or evolution from some\r\noriginal material. In one of them (x. 90), the well-known Hymn of Man\r\n(purusha-sukta), the gods are still the agents, but the material out\r\nof which the world is made consists of the body of a primeval giant,\r\nPurusha (man), who being thousand-headed and thousand-footed, extends\r\neven beyond the earth, as he covers it. The fundamental idea of the\r\nworld being created from the body of a giant is, indeed, very ancient,\r\nbeing met with in several primitive mythologies. But the manner in\r\nwhich the idea is here worked out is sufficiently late. Quite in\r\nthe spirit of the Brahmanas, where Vishnu is identified with the\r\nsacrifice, the act of creation is treated as a sacrificial rite,\r\nthe original man being conceived as a victim, the parts of which\r\nwhen cut up become portions of the universe. His head, we are told,\r\nbecame the sky, his navel the air, his feet the earth, while from\r\nhis mind sprang the moon, from his eye the sun, from his breath the\r\nwind. \"Thus they (the gods) fashioned the worlds.\" Another sign of\r\nthe lateness of the hymn is its pantheistic colouring; for it is here\r\nsaid that \"Purusha is all this world, what has been and shall be,\"\r\nand \"one-fourth of him is all creatures, and three-fourths are the\r\nworld of the immortals in heaven.\" In the Brahmanas, Purusha is the\r\nsame as the creator, Prajapati, and in the Upanishads he is identified\r\nwith the universe. Still later, in the dualistic Sankhya philosophy,\r\nPurusha becomes the name of \"soul\" as opposed to \"matter.\" In the Hymn\r\nof Man a being called Viraj is mentioned as produced from Purusha. This\r\nin the later Vedanta philosophy is a name of the personal creator as\r\ncontrasted with Brahma, the universal soul. The Purusha hymn, then,\r\nmay be regarded as the oldest product of the pantheistic literature\r\nof India. It is at the same time one of the very latest poems of the\r\nRigvedic age; for it presupposes a knowledge of the three oldest Vedas,\r\nto which it refers together by name. It also for the first and only\r\ntime in the Rigveda mentions the four castes; for it is here said that\r\nPurusha's mouth became the Brahman, his arms the Rajanya (warrior),\r\nhis thighs the Vaiçya (agriculturist), and his feet the Çudra (serf).\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the other poems dealing with the origin of the\r\nworld, not the gods collectively but an individual creator is\r\nthe actor. Various passages in other hymns show that the sun was\r\nregarded as an important agent of generation by the Rishis. Thus he\r\nis described as \"the soul of all that moves and stands\" (i. 115,\r\n1), and is said to be \"called by many names though one\" (i. 164,\r\n46). Such statements indicate that the sun was in process of being\r\nabstracted to the character of a creator. This is probably the origin\r\nof Viçvakarman, \"the all-creating,\" to whom two cosmogonic hymns\r\n(x. 81-82) are addressed. Three of the seven stanzas of the first\r\ndeserve to be quoted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    What was the place on which he gained a footing?\r\n    Where found he anything, or how, to hold by,\r\n    What time, the earth creating, Viçvakarman,\r\n    All-seeing, with his might disclosed the heavens?\r\n\r\n    Who has his eyes and mouth in every quarter,\r\n    Whose arms and feet are turned in all directions,\r\n    The one god, when the earth and heaven creating,\r\n    With his two arms and wings together welds them.\r\n\r\n    What was the wood, and what the tree, pray tell us,\r\n    From which they fashioned forth the earth and heaven?\r\n    Ye sages, in your mind, pray make inquiry,\r\n    Whereon he stood, when he the worlds supported?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting coincidence that \"wood,\" the term here used, was\r\nregularly employed in Greek philosophy to express \"original matter\"\r\n(hule).\r\n\r\nIn the next hymn (x. 82), the theory is advanced that the waters\r\nproduced the first germ of things, the source of the universe and\r\nthe gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who is our father, parent, and disposer,\r\n    Who knows all habitations and all beings,\r\n    Who only to the gods their names apportions:\r\n    To him all other beings turn inquiring?\r\n\r\n    What germ primeval did the waters cherish,\r\n    Wherein the gods all saw themselves together,\r\n    Which is beyond the earth, beyond that heaven,\r\n    Beyond the mighty gods' mysterious dwelling?\r\n\r\n    That germ primeval did the waters cherish,\r\n    Wherein the gods together all assembled,\r\n    The One that in the goat's [5] source is established,\r\n    Within which all the worlds are comprehended.\r\n\r\n    Ye cannot find him who these worlds created:\r\n    That which comes nearer to you is another.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a cosmogonic poem (x. 121) of considerable beauty the creator\r\nfurther appears under the name of Hiranyagarbha, \"germ of gold,\" a\r\nnotion doubtless suggested by the rising sun. Here, too, the waters\r\nare, in producing Agni, regarded as bearing the germ of all life.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Germ of Gold at first came into being,\r\n    Produced as the one lord of all existence.\r\n    The earth he has supported and this heaven:\r\n    What god shall we with sacrifices worship?\r\n\r\n    Who gives the breath of life and vital power,\r\n    To whose commands the gods all render homage,\r\n    Whose shade is death and life immortal:\r\n    What god shall we with sacrifices worship?\r\n\r\n    What time the mighty waters came containing\r\n    All germs of life and generating Agni,\r\n    Then was produced the gods' one vital spirit:\r\n    What god shall we with sacrifices worship?\r\n\r\n    Who with his mighty power surveyed the waters\r\n    That intellect and sacrifice engendered,\r\n    The one god over all the gods exalted:\r\n    What god shall we with sacrifices worship?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refrain receives its answer in a tenth stanza (added to the poem\r\nat a later time), which proclaims the unknown god to be Prajapati.\r\n\r\nTwo other cosmogonic poems explain the origin of the world\r\nphilosophically as the evolution of the existent (sat) from the\r\nnon-existent (asat). In the somewhat confused account given in one\r\nof them (x. 72), three stages of creation may be distinguished: first\r\nthe world is produced, then the gods, and lastly the sun. The theory\r\nof evolution is here still combined with that of creation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Even as a smith, the Lord of Prayer,\r\n    Together forged this universe:\r\n    In earliest ages of the gods\r\n    From what was not arose what is.\r\n\r\n\r\nA far finer composition than this is the Song of Creation (x. 129):--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Non-being then existed not, nor being:\r\n    There was no air, nor heaven which is beyond it.\r\n    What motion was there? Where? By whom directed?\r\n    Was water there, and fathomless abysses?\r\n\r\n    Death then existed not, nor life immortal;\r\n    Of neither night nor day was any semblance.\r\n    The One breathed calm and windless by self-impulse:\r\n    There was not any other thing beyond it.\r\n\r\n    Darkness at first was covered up by darkness;\r\n    This universe was indistinct and fluid.\r\n    The empty space that by the void was hidden.\r\n    That One was by the force of heat engendered.\r\n\r\n    Desire then at the first arose within it,\r\n    Desire, which was the earliest seed of spirit.\r\n    The bond of being in non-being sages\r\n    Discovered searching in their hearts with wisdom.\r\n\r\n    Who knows it truly? who can here declare it?\r\n    Whence was it born? whence issued this creation?\r\n    And did the gods appear with its production?\r\n    But then who knows from whence it has arisen?\r\n\r\n    This world-creation, whence it has arisen.\r\n    Or whether it has been produced or has not.\r\n    He who surveys it in the highest heaven,\r\n    He only knows, or ev'n he does not know it.\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from its high literary merit, this poem is most noteworthy\r\nfor the daring speculations which find utterance in so remote an\r\nage. But even here may be traced some of the main defects of Indian\r\nphilosophy--lack of clearness and consistency, with a tendency to make\r\nreasoning depend on mere words. Being the only piece of sustained\r\nspeculation in the Rigveda, it is the starting-point of the natural\r\nphilosophy which assumed shape in the evolutionary Sankhya system. It\r\nwill, moreover, always retain a general interest as the earliest\r\nspecimen of Aryan philosophic thought. With the theory of the Song of\r\nCreation, that after the non-existent had developed into the existent,\r\nwater came first, and then intelligence was evolved from it by heat,\r\nthe cosmogonic accounts of the Brahmanas substantially agree. Here,\r\ntoo, the non-existent becomes the existent, of which the first form\r\nis the waters. On these floats Hiranyagarbha, the cosmic golden\r\negg, whence is produced the spirit that desires and creates the\r\nuniverse. Always requiring the agency of the creator Prajapati at\r\nan earlier or a later stage, the Brahmanas in some of their accounts\r\nplace him first, in others the waters. This fundamental contradiction,\r\ndue to mixing up the theory of creation with that of evolution, is\r\nremoved in the Sankhya system by causing Purusha, or soul, to play the\r\npart of a passive spectator, while Prakriti, or primordial matter,\r\nundergoes successive stages of development. The cosmogonic hymns of\r\nthe Rigveda are not only thus the precursors of Indian philosophy,\r\nbut also of the Puranas, one of the main objects of which is to\r\ndescribe the origin of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE RIGVEDIC AGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe survey of the poetry of the Rigveda presented in the foregoing\r\npages will perhaps suffice to show that this unique monument of a\r\nlong-vanished age contains, apart from its historical interest, much of\r\næsthetic value, and well deserves to be read, at least in selections,\r\nby every lover of literature. The completeness of the picture\r\nit supplies of early religious thought has no parallel. Moreover,\r\nthough its purely secular poems are so few, the incidental references\r\ncontained in the whole collection are sufficiently numerous to afford\r\nmaterial for a tolerably detailed description of the social condition\r\nof the earliest Aryans in India. Here, then, we have an additional\r\nreason for attaching great importance to the Rigveda in the history\r\nof civilisation.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the home of the Vedic tribes is revealed to us by\r\nthe geographical data which the hymns yield. From these we may conclude\r\nwith certainty that the Aryan invaders, after having descended into\r\nthe plains, in all probability through the western passes of the\r\nHindu Kush, had already occupied the north-western corner of India\r\nwhich is now called by the Persian name of Panjab, or \"Land of Five\r\nRivers.\" [6] Mention is made in the hymns of some twenty-five streams,\r\nall but two or three of which belong to the Indus river system. Among\r\nthem are the five which water the territory of the Panjab, and, after\r\nuniting in a single stream, flow into the Indus. They are the Vitasta\r\n(now Jhelum), the Asikni (Chenab), the Parushni (later called Iravati,\r\n\"the refreshing,\" whence its present name, Ravi), the Vipaç (Beäs),\r\nand the largest and most easterly, the Çutudri (Sutlej). Some of\r\nthe Vedic tribes, however, still remained on the farther side of\r\nthe Indus, occupying the valleys of its western tributaries, from\r\nthe Kubha (Kabul), with its main affluent to the north, the Suvastu,\r\nriver \"of fair dwellings\" (now Swat), to the Krumu (Kurum) and Gomati,\r\n\"abounding in cows\" (now Gomal), farther south.\r\n\r\nFew of the rivers of the Rigveda are mentioned more than two or three\r\ntimes in the hymns, and several of them not more than once. The\r\nonly names of frequent occurrence are those of the Indus and the\r\nSarasvati. One entire hymn (x. 75) is devoted to its laudation, but\r\neighteen other streams, mostly its tributaries, share its praises in\r\ntwo stanzas. The mighty river seems to have made a deep impression on\r\nthe mind of the poet. He speaks of her as the swiftest of the swift,\r\nsurpassing all other streams in volume of water. Other rivers flow\r\nto her as lowing cows hasten to their calf. The roar and rush of her\r\nwaters are described in enthusiastic strains:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    From earth the sullen roar swells upward to the sky,\r\n    With brilliant spray she dashes up unending surge;\r\n    As when the streams of rain pour thund'ring from the cloud,\r\n    The Sindhu onward rushes like a bellowing bull.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sindhu (now Sindh), which in Sanskrit simply means the \"river,\"\r\nas the western boundary of the Aryan settlements, suggested to the\r\nnations of antiquity which first came into contact with them in that\r\nquarter a name for the whole peninsula. Adopted in the form of Indos,\r\nthe word gave rise to the Greek appellation India as the country of\r\nthe Indus. It was borrowed by the ancient Persians as Hindu, which\r\nis used in the Avesta as a name of the country itself. More accurate\r\nis the modern Persian designation Hindustan, \"land of the Indus,\"\r\na name properly applying only to that part of the peninsula which\r\nlies between the Himalaya and Vindhya ranges.\r\n\r\nMention is often made in the Rigveda of the sapta sindhavah, or\r\n\"seven rivers,\" which in one passage at least is synonymous with the\r\ncountry inhabited by the Aryan Indians. It is interesting to note\r\nthat the same expression hapta hindu occurs in the Avesta, though it\r\nis there restricted to mean only that part of the Indian territory\r\nwhich lay in Eastern Kabulistan. If \"seven\" is here intended for a\r\ndefinite number, the \"seven rivers\" must originally have meant the\r\nKabul, the Indus, and the five rivers of the Panjab, though later the\r\nSarasvati may have been substituted for the Kabul. For the Sarasvati\r\nis the sacred river of the Rigveda, more frequently mentioned,\r\ngenerally as a goddess, and lauded with more fervour than any other\r\nstream. The poet's descriptions are often only applicable to a large\r\nriver. Hence Roth and other distinguished scholars concluded that\r\nSarasvati is generally used by the poets of the Rigveda simply as a\r\nsacred designation of the Indus. On the other hand, the name in a few\r\npassages undoubtedly means the small river midway between the Sutlej\r\nand the Jumna, which at a later period formed, with the Drishadvati,\r\nthe eastern boundary of the sacred region called Brahmavarta, lying\r\nto the south of Ambala, and commencing some sixty miles south of Simla.\r\n\r\nThis small river now loses itself in the sands of the desert, but\r\nthe evidence of ancient river-beds appears to favour the conclusion\r\nthat it was originally a tributary of the Çutudri (Sutlej). It is\r\ntherefore not improbable that in Vedic times it reached the sea,\r\nand was considerably larger than it is now. Considering, too, the\r\nspecial sanctity which it had already acquired, the laudations supposed\r\nto be compatible only with the magnitude of the Indus may not have\r\nseemed too exaggerated when applied to the lesser stream. It is to\r\nbe noted that the Drishadvati, the \"stony\" (now Ghogra or Ghugger),\r\nin the only passage in which the name occurs in the Rigveda, is\r\nassociated with the Sarasvati, Agni being invoked to flame on the\r\nbanks of these rivers. This is perhaps an indication that even in the\r\nage of the Rigveda the most easterly limit of the Indus river system\r\nhad already acquired a certain sanctity as the region in which the\r\nsacrificial ritual and the art of sacred poetry were practised in\r\nthe greatest perfection. There are indications showing that by the\r\nend at least of the Rigvedic period some of the Aryan invaders had\r\npassed beyond this region and had reached the western limit of the\r\nGangetic river system. For the Yamuna (now Jumna), the most westerly\r\ntributary of the Ganges in the north, is mentioned in three passages,\r\ntwo of which prove that the Aryan settlements already extended to its\r\nbanks. The Ganges itself is already known, for its name is mentioned\r\ndirectly in one passage of the Rigveda and indirectly in another. It\r\nis, however, a noteworthy fact that the name of the Ganges is not to\r\nbe found in any of the other Vedas.\r\n\r\nThe southward migration of the Aryan invaders does not appear to have\r\nextended, at the time when the hymns of the Rigveda were composed,\r\nmuch beyond the point where the united waters of the Panjab flow\r\ninto the Indus. The ocean was probably known only from hearsay, for\r\nno mention is made of the numerous mouths of the Indus, and fishing,\r\none of the main occupations on the banks of the Lower Indus at the\r\npresent day, is quite ignored. The word for fish (matsya), indeed,\r\nonly occurs once, though various kinds of animals, birds, and insects\r\nare so frequently mentioned. This accords with the character of the\r\nrivers of the Panjab and Eastern Kabulistan, which are poor in fish,\r\nwhile it contrasts with the intimate knowledge of fishing betrayed\r\nby the Yajurveda, which was composed when the Aryans had spread much\r\nfarther to the east, and, doubtless, also to the south. The word which\r\nlater is the regular name for \"ocean\" (sam-udra), seems therefore,\r\nin agreement with its etymological sense (\"collection of waters\"),\r\nto mean in the Rigveda only the lower course of the Indus, which,\r\nafter receiving the waters of the Panjab, is so wide that a boat in\r\nmid-stream is invisible from the bank. It has been noted in recent\r\ntimes that the natives in this region speak of the river as the \"sea of\r\nSindh;\" and indeed the word sindhu (\"river\") itself in several passages\r\nof the Rigveda has practically the sense of \"sea.\" Metaphors such as\r\nwould be used by a people familiar with the ocean are lacking in the\r\nRigveda. All references to navigation point only to the crossing of\r\nrivers in boats impelled by oars, the main object being to reach the\r\nother bank (para). This action suggested a favourite figure, which\r\nremained familiar throughout Sanskrit literature. Thus one of the\r\npoets of the Rigveda invokes Agni with the words, \"Take us across all\r\nwoes and dangers as across the river (sindhu) in a boat;\" and in the\r\nlater literature one who has accomplished his purpose or mastered his\r\nsubject is very frequently described as \"having reached the farther\r\nshore\" (paraga). The Atharva-veda, on the other hand, contains some\r\npassages showing that its composers were acquainted with the ocean.\r\n\r\nMountains are constantly mentioned in the Rigveda, and rivers are\r\ndescribed as flowing from them. The Himalaya (\"abode of snow\") range in\r\ngeneral is evidently meant by the \"snowy\" (himavantah) mountains which\r\nare in the keeping of the Creator. But no individual peak is mentioned\r\nwith the exception of Mujavat, which is indirectly referred to as\r\nthe home of Soma. This peak, it is to be inferred from later Vedic\r\nliterature, was situated close to the Kabul Valley, and was probably\r\none of the mountains to the south-west of Kashmir. The Atharva-veda\r\nalso mentions two other mountains of the Himalaya. One of these is\r\ncalled Trikakud, the \"three-peaked\" (in the later literature Trikuta,\r\nand even now Trikota), through the valley at the foot of which flows\r\nthe Asikni (Chenab). The other is Navaprabhramçana (\"sinking of the\r\nship\"), doubtless identical with the Naubandhana (\"binding of the\r\nship\") of the epic and the Manoravasarpana of the Çatapatha Brahmana,\r\non which the ship of Manu is said to have rested when the deluge\r\nsubsided. The Rigveda knows nothing of the Vindhya range, which\r\ndivides Northern India from the southern triangle of the peninsula\r\ncalled the Dekhan; [7] nor does it mention the Narmada River (now\r\nNerbudda), which flows immediately south of and parallel to that range.\r\n\r\nFrom these data it may safely be concluded that the Aryans, when the\r\nhymns of the Rigveda were composed, had overspread that portion of\r\nthe north-west which appears on the map as a fan-shaped territory,\r\nbounded on the west by the Indus, on the east by the Sutlej, and on\r\nthe north by the Himalaya, with a fringe of settlements extending\r\nbeyond those limits to the east and the west. Now the Panjab of the\r\npresent day is a vast arid plain, from which, except in the north-west\r\ncorner at Rawal Pindi, no mountains are visible, and over which no\r\nmonsoon storms break. Here there are no grand displays of the strife\r\nof the elements, but only gentle showers fall during the rainy season,\r\nwhile the phenomena of dawn are far more gorgeous than elsewhere in\r\nthe north. There is, therefore, some probability in the contention of\r\nProfessor Hopkins, that only the older hymns, such as those to Varuna\r\nand Ushas, were composed in the Panjab itself, while the rest arose\r\nin the sacred region near the Sarasvati, south of the modern Ambala,\r\nwhere all the conditions required by the Rigveda are found. This is\r\nmore likely than the assumption that the climate of the Panjab has\r\nradically changed since the age of the Vedic poets.\r\n\r\nThat the home of the Aryans in the age of the Rigveda was the region\r\nindicated is further borne out by the information the poems yield\r\nabout the products of the country, its flora and fauna. Thus the soma,\r\nthe most important plant of the Rigveda, is described as growing on\r\nthe mountains, and must have been easily obtainable, as its juice was\r\nused in large quantities for the daily ritual. In the period of the\r\nBrahmanas it was brought from long distances, or substitutes had to\r\nbe used on account of its rarity. Thus the identity of the original\r\nplant came to be lost in India. The plant which is now commonly\r\nused is evidently quite another, for its juice when drunk produces a\r\nnauseating effect, widely different from the feeling of exhilaration\r\ndwelt on by the poets of the Rigveda. Nor can the plant which the\r\nParsis still import from Persia for the Haoma rite be identical with\r\nthe old soma. Again, rice, which is familiar to the later Vedas and\r\nregarded in them as one of the necessaries of life, is not mentioned\r\nin the Rigveda at all. Its natural habitat is in the south-east, the\r\nregular monsoon area, where the rainfall is very abundant. Hence it\r\nprobably did not exist in the region of the Indus river system when\r\nthe Rigveda was composed, though, in later times, with the practice\r\nof irrigation, its cultivation spread to all parts of India. Corn\r\n(yava) was grown by the tillers of the Rigveda, but the term is\r\nprobably not restricted, as later, to the sense of barley.\r\n\r\nAmong large trees mentioned in the Rigveda, the most important is the\r\nAçvattha (\"horse-stand\") or sacred fig-tree (Ficus religiosa). Its\r\nfruit (pippala) is described as sweet and the food of birds. Its\r\nsacredness is at least incipient, for its wood was used for soma\r\nvessels, and, as we learn from the Atharva-veda, also for the drill\r\n(later-called pramantha) employed in producing the sacred fire. The\r\nlatter Veda further tells us that the gods are seated in the third\r\nheaven under an Açvattha, which may indeed have been intended\r\nin the Rigveda itself by the \"tree with fair foliage,\" in whose\r\nshade the blessed revel with Yama. This tree, now called Peepal,\r\nis still considered so sacred that a Hindu would be afraid to utter\r\na falsehood beside it. But the Rigveda does not mention at all, and\r\nthe Atharva-veda only twice, the tree which is most characteristic\r\nof India, and shades with its wide-spreading foliage a larger\r\narea than any other tree on the face of the earth--the Nyagrodha\r\n(\"growing downwards\") or banyan (Ficus indica). With its lofty dome\r\nof foliage impenetrable to the rays of the sun and supported by many\r\nlesser trunks as by columns, this great tree resembles a vast temple\r\nof verdure fashioned by the hand of Nature. What the village oak is\r\nin England, that and much more is the banyan to the dwellers in the\r\ninnumerable hamlets which overspread the face of agricultural India.\r\n\r\nAmong wild animals, one of the most familiar to the poets of the\r\nRigveda is the lion (simha). They describe him as living in wooded\r\nmountains and as caught with snares, but the characteristic on which\r\nthey chiefly dwell is his roaring. In the vast desert to the east of\r\nthe Lower Sutlej and of the Indus, the only part of India suited for\r\nits natural habitat, the lion was in ancient times no doubt frequent,\r\nbut he now survives only in the wooded hills to the south of the\r\npeninsula of Gujarat. The king of beasts has, however, remained\r\nconventionally familiar in Indian literature, and his old Sanskrit\r\ndesignation is still common in Hindu names in the form of Singh.\r\n\r\nThe tiger is not mentioned in the Rigveda at all, its natural home\r\nbeing the swampy jungles of Bengal, though he is now found in all the\r\njungly parts of India. But in the other Vedas he has decidedly taken\r\nthe place of the lion, which is, however, still known. His dangerous\r\ncharacter as a beast of prey is here often referred to. Thus the\r\nWhite Yajurveda compares a peculiarly hazardous undertaking with\r\nwaking a sleeping tiger; and the Atharva-veda describes the animal\r\nas \"man eating\" (purushad). The relation of the tiger to the lion in\r\nthe Vedas therefore furnishes peculiarly interesting evidence of the\r\neastward migration of the Aryans during the Vedic period.\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar is the position of the elephant. It is explicitly\r\nreferred to in only two passages of the Rigveda, and the form of the\r\nname applied to it, \"the beast (mriga) with a hand (hastin),\" shows\r\nthat the Rishis still regarded it as a strange creature. One passage\r\nseems to indicate that by the end of the Rigvedic period attempts\r\nwere made to catch the animal. That the capture of wild elephants\r\nhad in any case become a regular practice by 300 B.C. is proved by\r\nthe evidence of Megasthenes. To the Atharva- and the Yajur-vedas the\r\nelephant is quite familiar, for it is not only frequently mentioned,\r\nbut the adjective hastin, \"possessing a hand\" (i.e. trunk), has\r\nbecome sufficiently distinctive to be used by itself to designate\r\nthe animal. The regular home of the elephant in Northern India is\r\nthe Terai or lowland jungle at the foot of the Himalaya, extending\r\neastward from about the longitude of Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nThe wolf (vrika) is mentioned more frequently in the Rigveda than the\r\nlion himself, and there are many references to the boar (varaha),\r\nwhich was hunted with dogs. The buffalo (mahisha), in the tame as\r\nwell as the wild state, was evidently very familiar to the poets,\r\nwho several times allude to its flesh being cooked and eaten. There\r\nis only one reference to the bear (riksha). The monkey (kapi) is only\r\nmentioned in a late hymn (x. 86), but in such a way as to show that\r\nthe animal had already been tamed. The later and ordinary Sanskrit\r\nname for monkey, vanara (\"forest-animal\"), has survived in the modern\r\nvernaculars, and is known to readers of Mr. Rudyard Kipling in the\r\nform of Bunder-log (\"monkey-people\").\r\n\r\nAmong the domestic animals known to the Rigveda those of lesser\r\nimportance are sheep, goats, asses, and dogs. The latter, it may\r\nbe gathered, were used for hunting, guarding, and tracking cattle,\r\nas well as for keeping watch at night. Cattle, however, occupy the\r\nchief place. Cows were the chief form of wealth, and the name of the\r\nsacrificial \"fee,\" [8] dakshina, is properly an adjective meaning\r\n\"right,\" \"valuable,\" with the ellipse of go, \"cow.\" No sight gladdened\r\nthe eye of the Vedic Indian more than the cow returning from the\r\npasture and licking her calf fastened by a cord; no sound was more\r\nmusical to his ear than the lowing of milch kine. To him therefore\r\nthere was nothing grotesque in the poet exclaiming, \"As cows low\r\nto their calves near the stalls, so we will praise Indra with our\r\nhymns,\" or \"Like unmilked kine we have called aloud (lowed) to thee,\r\nO hero (Indra).\" For greater security cows were, after returning\r\nfrom pasture, kept in stalls during the night and let out again in\r\nthe morning. Though the cow-killer is in the White Yajurveda already\r\nsaid to be punishable with death, the Rigveda does not express an\r\nabsolute prohibition, for the wedding-hymn shows that even the cow was\r\nslaughtered on specially solemn occasions, while bulls are several\r\ntimes described as sacrificed to Indra in large numbers. Whilst the\r\ncows were out at pasture, bulls and oxen were regularly used for the\r\npurpose of ploughing and drawing carts.\r\n\r\nHorses came next in value to cattle, for wealth in steeds is\r\nconstantly prayed for along with abundance of cows. To a people so\r\nfrequently engaged in battle, the horse was of essential value in\r\ndrawing the war-car; he was also indispensable in the chariot-race,\r\nto which the Vedic Indian was devoted. He was, however, not yet used\r\nfor riding. The horse-sacrifice, moreover, was regarded as the most\r\nimportant and efficacious of animal sacrifices.\r\n\r\nOf the birds of the Rigveda I need only mention those which have\r\nsome historical or literary interest. The wild goose or swan (hamsa),\r\nso familiar to the classical poets, is frequently referred to, being\r\nsaid to swim in the water and to fly in a line. The curious power of\r\nseparating soma from water is attributed to it in the White Yajurveda,\r\nas that of extracting milk from water is in the later poetry. The\r\nlatter faculty belongs to the curlew (krunch), according to the\r\nsame Veda.\r\n\r\nThe chakravaka or ruddy goose, on the fidelity of which the post-Vedic\r\npoets so often dwell, is mentioned once in the Rigveda, the Açvins\r\nbeing said to come in the morning like a couple of these birds,\r\nwhile the Atharva-veda already refers to them as models of conjugal\r\nlove. Peahens (mayuri) are spoken of in the Rigveda as removing\r\npoison, and parrots (çuka) are alluded to as yellow. By the time of the\r\nYajurveda the latter bird had been tamed, for it is there described as\r\n\"uttering human speech.\"\r\n\r\nA good illustration of the dangers of the argumentum ex silentio\r\nis furnished by the fact that salt, the most necessary of minerals,\r\nis never once mentioned in the Rigveda. And yet the Northern Panjab\r\nis the very part of India where it most abounds. It occurs in the\r\nsalt range between the Indus and the Jhelum in such quantities that\r\nthe Greek companions of Alexander, according to Strabo, asserted the\r\nsupply to be sufficient for the wants of the whole of India.\r\n\r\nAmong the metals, gold is the one most frequently mentioned in the\r\nRigveda. It was probably for the most part obtained from the rivers\r\nof the north-west, which even at the present day are said to yield\r\nconsiderable quantities of the precious metal. Thus the Indus is\r\nspoken of by the poets as \"golden\" or \"having a golden bed.\" There\r\nare indications that kings possessed gold in abundance. Thus one poet\r\npraises his royal benefactor for bestowing ten nuggets of gold upon\r\nhim besides other bountiful gifts. Gold ornaments of various kinds,\r\nsuch as ear-rings and armlets, are often mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe metal which is most often referred to in the Rigveda next to gold\r\nis called ayas (Latin, aes). It is a matter of no slight historical\r\ninterest to decide whether this signifies \"iron\" or not. In most\r\npassages where it occurs the word appears to mean simply \"metal.\" In\r\nthe few cases where it designates a particular metal, the evidence is\r\nnot very conclusive; but the inference which may be drawn as to its\r\ncolour is decidedly in favour of its having been reddish, which points\r\nto bronze and not iron. The fact that the Atharva-veda distinguishes\r\nbetween \"dark\" ayas and \"red,\" seems to indicate that the distinction\r\nbetween iron and copper or bronze had only recently been drawn. It is,\r\nmoreover, well known that in the progress of civilisation the use of\r\nbronze always precedes that of iron. Yet it would be rash to assert\r\nthat iron was altogether unknown even to the earlier Vedic age. It\r\nseems quite likely that the Aryans of that period were unacquainted\r\nwith silver, for its name is not mentioned in the Rigveda, and the\r\nknowledge of silver goes hand in hand with that of iron, owing to\r\nthe manner in which these metals are intermingled in the ore which\r\nproduces them. These two metals, moreover, are not found in any\r\nquantity in the north-west of India.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the topography, the climate, and the products of\r\nthe country thus shows that the people by whose poets the Rigveda was\r\ncomposed were settled in the north-west of India, from the Kabul to the\r\nJumna. But they were still engaged in conflict with the aborigines, for\r\nmany victories over them are referred to. Thus Indra is said to have\r\nbound 1000 or slain 30,000 of them for his allies. That the conquerors\r\nwere bent on acquiring new territory appears from the rivers being\r\nfrequently mentioned as obstacles to farther advance. The invaders,\r\nthough split up into many tribes, were conscious of a unity of race\r\nand religion. They styled themselves Aryas or \"kinsmen,\" as opposed to\r\nthe aborigines, to whom they gave the name of Dasyu or Dasa, \"fiends,\"\r\nin later times also called anarya, or non-Aryans. The characteristic\r\nphysical difference between the two races was that of colour (varna),\r\nthe aborigines being described as \"black\" (krishna) or \"black-skins,\"\r\nand as the \"Dasa colour,\" in contrast with the \"Aryan colour\" or \"our\r\ncolour.\" This contrast undoubtedly formed the original basis of caste,\r\nthe regular name for which in Sanskrit is \"colour.\"\r\n\r\nThose of the conquered race who did not escape to the hills and were\r\ncaptured became slaves. Thus one singer receives from his royal\r\npatron a hundred asses, a hundred sheep, and a hundred Dasas. The\r\nlatter word in later Sanskrit regularly means servant or slave,\r\nmuch in the same way as \"captive Slav\" to the German came to mean\r\n\"slave.\" When thoroughly subjected, the original inhabitants, ceasing\r\nto be called Dasyus, became the fourth caste under the later name of\r\nÇudras. The Dasyus are described in the Rigveda as non-sacrificing,\r\nunbelieving, and impious. They are also doubtless meant by the\r\nphallus-worshippers mentioned in two passages. The Aryans in course\r\nof time came to adopt this form of cult. There are several passages\r\nin the Mahabharata showing that Çiva was already venerated under the\r\nemblem of the phallus when that epic was composed. Phallus-worship is\r\nwidely diffused in India at the present day, but is most prevalent\r\nin the south. The Dasyus appear to have been a pastoral race, for\r\nthey possessed large herds, which were captured by the victorious\r\nAryans. They fortified themselves in strongholds (called pur), which\r\nmust have been numerous, as Indra is sometimes said to have destroyed\r\nas many as a hundred of them for his allies.\r\n\r\nThe Rigveda mentions many tribes among the Aryans. The most\r\nnorth-westerly of these are the Gandharis, who, judged by the way they\r\nare referred to, must have been breeders of sheep. They were later\r\nwell known as Gandharas or Gandharas. The Atharva-veda mentions as\r\ncontiguous to the Gandharis the Mujavats, a tribe doubtless settled\r\nclose to Mount Mujavat; evidently regarding these two as the extreme\r\nlimit of the Aryan settlements to the north-west.\r\n\r\nThe most important part, if not the whole, of the Indian Aryans is\r\nmeant by the \"five tribes,\" an expression of frequent occurrence in the\r\nRigveda. It is not improbable that by this term were meant five tribes\r\nwhich are enumerated together in two passages, the Purus, Turvaças,\r\nYadus, Anus, and Druhyus. These are often mentioned as engaged in\r\nintertribal conflicts. Four of them, along with some other clans, are\r\nnamed as having formed a coalition under ten kings against Sudas, chief\r\nof the Tritsus. The opposing forces met on the banks of the Parushni,\r\nwhere the great \"battle of the ten kings\" was fought. The coalition,\r\nin their endeavours to cross the stream and to deflect its course,\r\nwere repulsed with heavy loss by the Tritsus.\r\n\r\nThe Purus are described as living on both banks of the Sarasvati. A\r\npart of them must, however, have remained behind farther west, as\r\nthey were found on the Parushni in Alexander's time. The Rigveda often\r\nmentions their king, Trasadasyu, son of Purukutsa, and speaks of his\r\ndescendant Trikshi as a powerful prince. The Turvaças are one of the\r\nmost frequently named of the tribes. With them are generally associated\r\nthe Yadus, among whom the priestly family of the Kanvas seems to have\r\nlived. It is to be inferred from one passage of the Rigveda that the\r\nAnus were settled on the Parushni, and the priestly family of the\r\nBhrigus, it would appear, belonged to them. Their relations to the\r\nDruhyus seem to have been particularly close. The Matsyas, mentioned\r\nonly in one passage of the Rigveda, were also foes of the Tritsus. In\r\nthe Mahabharata we find them located on the western bank of the Yamuna.\r\n\r\nA more important name among the enemies of Sudas is that of the\r\nBharatas. One hymn (iii. 33) describes them as coming to the rivers\r\nVipaç and Çutudri accompanied by Viçvamitra, who, as we learn\r\nfrom another hymn (iii. 53), had formerly been the chief priest of\r\nSudas, and who now made the waters fordable for the Bharatas by his\r\nprayers. This is probably the occasion on which, according to another\r\nhymn (vii. 33), the Bharatas were defeated by Sudas and his Tritsus,\r\nwho were aided by the invocations of Vasishtha, the successor and\r\nrival of Viçvamitra. The Bharatas appear to be specially connected\r\nwith sacrificial rites in the Rigveda; for Agni receives the epithet\r\nBharata, \"belonging to the Bharatas,\" and the ritual goddess Bharati,\r\nfrequently associated with Sarasvati, derives her name from them. In\r\na hymn to Agni (iii. 23), mention is made of two Bharatas named\r\nDevaçravas and Devavata who kindled the sacred fire on the Drishadvati,\r\nthe Apaya, and the Sarasvati, the very region which is later celebrated\r\nas the holy land of Brahmanism under the names of Brahmavarta and\r\nKurukshetra. The family of the Kuçikas, to whom Viçvamitra belonged,\r\nwas closely connected with the Bharatas.\r\n\r\nThe Tritsus appear to have been settled somewhere to the east of the\r\nParushni, on the left bank of which Sudas may be supposed to have drawn\r\nup his forces to resist the coalition of the ten kings attempting to\r\ncross the stream from the west. Five tribes, whose names do not occur\r\nlater, are mentioned as allied with Sudas in the great battle. The\r\nSrinjayas were probably also confederates of the Tritsus, being,\r\nlike the latter, described as enemies of the Turvaças.\r\n\r\nOf some tribes we learn nothing from the Rigveda but the name, which,\r\nhowever, survives till later times. Thus the Uçinaras, mentioned only\r\nonce, were, at the period when the Aitareya Brahmana was composed,\r\nlocated in the middle of Northern India; and the Chedis, also referred\r\nto only once, are found in the epic age settled in Magadha (Southern\r\nBehar). Krivi, as a tribal name connected with the Indus and Asikni,\r\npoints to the north-west. In the Çatapatha Brahmana it is stated to\r\nbe the old name of the Panchalas, who inhabited the country to the\r\nnorth of the modern Delhi.\r\n\r\nThe Atharva-veda mentions as remote tribes not only the Gandharis and\r\nMujavats, but also the Magadhas (Behar) and the Angas (Bengal). We\r\nmay therefore conclude that by the time that Veda was completed the\r\nAryans had already spread to the Delta of the Ganges.\r\n\r\nThe Panchalas are not mentioned in either Veda, and the name of the\r\nKurus is only found there indirectly in two or three compounds or\r\nderivatives. They are first referred to in the White Yajurveda; yet\r\nthey are the two most prominent peoples of the Brahmana period. On the\r\nother hand, the names of a number of the most important of the Rigvedic\r\ntribes, such as the Purus, Turvaças, Yadus, Tritsus, and others,\r\nhave entirely or practically disappeared from the Brahmanas. Even the\r\nBharatas, though held in high regard by the composers of the Brahmanas,\r\nand set up by them as models of correct conduct, appear to have ceased\r\nto represent a political entity, for there are no longer any references\r\nto them in that sense, as to other peoples of the day. Their name,\r\nmoreover, does not occur in the tribal enumerations of the Aitareya\r\nBrahmana and of Manu, while it is practically altogether ignored in\r\nthe Buddhistic literature.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, it is natural to suppose that the numerous Vedic\r\ntribes, under the altered conditions of life in vast plains, coalesced\r\ninto nations with new names. Thus the Bharatas, to whom belonged\r\nthe royal race of the Kurus in the epic, and from whom the very name\r\nof the Mahabharata, which describes the great war of the Kurus, is\r\nderived, were doubtless absorbed in what came to be called the Kuru\r\nnation. In the genealogical system of the Mahabharata the Purus are\r\nbrought into close connection with the Kurus. This is probably an\r\nindication that they too had amalgamated with the latter people. It\r\nis not unlikely that the Tritsus, whose name disappears after the\r\nRigveda, also furnished one of the elements of the Kuru nation.\r\n\r\nAs to the Panchalas, we have seen that they represent the old\r\nKrivis. It is, however, likely that the latter combined with several\r\nsmall tribes to make up the later nation. A Brahmana passage contains\r\nan indication that the Turvaças may have been one of these. Perhaps\r\nthe Yadus, generally associated with the Turvaças in the Rigveda, were\r\nalso one of them. The epic still preserves the name, in the patronymic\r\nform of Yadava, as that of the race in which Krishna was born. The\r\nname of the Panchalas itself (derived from pancha, five) seems to\r\nindicate that this people consisted of an aggregate of five elements.\r\n\r\nSome of the tribes mentioned in the Rigveda, however, maintained\r\ntheir individual identity under their old names down to the epic\r\nperiod. These were the Uçinaras, Srinjayas, Matsyas, and Chedis.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the Rigveda refers to a rich and\r\npowerful prince called Ikshvaku. In the epic this name recurs as that\r\nof a mighty king who ruled to the east of the Ganges in the city of\r\nAyodhya (Oudh) and was the founder of the Solar race.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from what has been said that the Vedic Aryans were split up\r\ninto numerous tribes, which, though conscious of their unity in race,\r\nlanguage, and religion, had no political cohesion. They occasionally\r\nformed coalitions, it is true, but were just as often at war with one\r\nanother. The tribe, in fact, was the political unit, organised much\r\nin the same way as the Afghans are at the present day, or the Germans\r\nwere in the time of Tacitus. The tribe (jana) consisted of a number of\r\nsettlements (viç), which again were formed of an aggregate of villages\r\n(grama). The fighting organisation of the tribe appears to have been\r\nbased on these divisions. The houses forming the village seem to\r\nhave been built entirely of wood, as they still were in the time of\r\nMegasthenes. In the midst of each house the domestic fire burnt. For\r\nprotection against foes or inundations, fortified enclosures (called\r\npur) were made on eminences. They consisted of earthworks strengthened\r\nwith a stockade, or occasionally with stone. There is nothing to show\r\nthat they were inhabited, much less that pur ever meant a town or city,\r\nas it did in later times.\r\n\r\nThe basis of Vedic society being the patriarchal family, the government\r\nof the tribe was naturally monarchical. The king (raja) was often\r\nhereditary. Thus several successive members of the same family are\r\nmentioned as rulers of the Tritsus and of the Purus. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, the king was elected by the districts (viç) of the tribe;\r\nbut whether the choice was then limited to members of the royal race,\r\nor was extended to certain noble families, does not appear. In times\r\nof peace the main duty of the king was to ensure the protection of\r\nhis people. In return they rendered him obedience, and supplied him\r\nwith voluntary gifts--not fixed taxes--for his maintenance. His power\r\nwas by no means absolute, being limited by the will of the people\r\nexpressed in the tribal assembly (samiti). As to the constitution\r\nand functions of the latter, we have unfortunately little or no\r\ninformation. In war, the king of course held the chief command. On\r\nimportant occasions, such as the eve of a battle, it was also his\r\nduty to offer sacrifice on behalf of his tribe, either performing\r\nthe rites himself, or employing a priest to do so.\r\n\r\nEvery tribe doubtless possessed a family of singers who attended the\r\nking, praising his deeds as well as composing hymns to accompany the\r\nsacrifice in honour of the gods. Depending on the liberality of their\r\npatrons, these poets naturally did not neglect to lay stress on the\r\nefficacy of their invocations, and on the importance of rewarding them\r\nwell for their services. The priest whom a king appointed to officiate\r\nfor him was called a purohita or domestic chaplain. Vasishtha occupied\r\nthat position in the employ of King Sudas; and in one of his hymns\r\n(vii. 33) he does not fail to point out that the victory of the\r\nTritsus was due to his prayers. The panegyrics on liberal patrons\r\ncontain manifest exaggerations, partly, no doubt, intended to act\r\nas an incentive to other princes. Nevertheless, the gifts in gold,\r\ncows, horses, chariots, and garments bestowed by kings on their chief\r\npriests must often have been considerable, especially after important\r\nvictories. Under the later Brahmanic hierarchy liberality to the\r\npriestly caste became a duty, while the amount of the sacrificial\r\nfee was fixed for each particular rite.\r\n\r\nThe employment of Purohitas by kings as their substitutes in\r\nthe performance of sacrificial functions is to be regarded as the\r\nbeginning and the oldest form of the priesthood in India. It became\r\nthe starting-point of the historically unique hierarchical order in\r\nwhich the sacerdotal caste occupied the supreme position in society,\r\nand the State was completely merged in the Church. Such, indeed,\r\nwas the ideal of the Catholic Church in the West during the Middle\r\nAges, but it never became an accomplished fact in Europe, as it did\r\nin India. No sooner had the priesthood become hereditary than the\r\ndevelopment of a caste system began, which has had no parallel in\r\nany other country. But during the period represented by Sudas and\r\nVasishtha, in which the older portion of the Rigveda was composed,\r\nthe priesthood was not yet hereditary, still less had the warrior\r\nand sacerdotal classes became transformed into castes among the Aryan\r\ntribes settled in the Panjab. This is confirmed by the fact that in\r\nthe epic age the inhabitants of Madhyadeça or Mid-land, where the\r\nBrahmanic caste system grew up, regarded the people of the north-west\r\nas semi-barbarians.\r\n\r\nIn the simple social organisation of the Vedic tribes of this region,\r\nwhere occupations were but little differentiated, every man was a\r\nsoldier as well a civilian, much as among the Afghans of to-day. As\r\nthey moved farther to the east, society became more complex,\r\nand vocations tended to become hereditary. The population being\r\nnow spread over wider tracts of territory, the necessity arose for\r\nsomething in the nature of a standing army to repel sudden attacks\r\nor quell risings of the subject aborigines. The nucleus would have\r\nbeen supplied by the families of the chiefs of lesser tribes which\r\nhad amalgamated under some military leader. The agricultural and\r\nindustrial part of the population were thus left to follow their\r\npursuits without interruption. Meanwhile the religious ceremonial was\r\nincreasing in complexity; its success was growing more dependent on\r\ncorrect performance, while the preservation of the ancient hymns was\r\nbecoming more urgent. The priests had, therefore, to devote all their\r\ntime and energies to the carrying out of their religious duties and\r\nthe handing down of the sacred tradition in their families.\r\n\r\nOwing to these causes, the three main classes of Aryan society became\r\nmore and more separated. But how were they transformed into castes or\r\nsocial strata divided from one another by the impassable barriers of\r\nheredity and the prohibition of intermarrying or eating together? This\r\nrigid mutual exclusiveness must have started, in the first instance,\r\nfrom the treatment of the conquered aborigines, who, on accepting\r\nthe Aryan belief, were suffered to form a part of the Aryan polity\r\nin the capacity of a servile class. The gulf between the two races\r\nneed not have been wider than that which at the present day, in the\r\nUnited States, divides the whites from the negroes. When the latter\r\nare described as men of \"colour,\" the identical term is used which, in\r\nIndia, came to mean \"caste.\" Having become hereditary, the sacerdotal\r\nclass succeeded in securing a position of sanctity and inviolability\r\nwhich raised them above the rest of the Aryans as the latter were\r\nraised above the Dasas. When their supremacy was established, they\r\nproceeded to organise the remaining classes in the state on similar\r\nlines of exclusiveness. To the time when the system of the three Aryan\r\ncastes, with the Çudras added as a fourth, already existed in its\r\nfundamental principles, belong the greater part of the independent\r\nportions of the Yajurveda, a considerable part of the Atharva-veda\r\n(most of books viii. to xiii.), but of the Rigveda, besides the one\r\n(x. 90) which distinctly refers to the four castes by name, only a\r\nfew of the latest hymns of the first, eighth, and tenth books. The\r\nword brahmana, the regular name for \"man of the first caste,\" is still\r\nrare in the Rigveda, occurring only eight times, while brahman, which\r\nsimply means sage or officiating priest, is found forty-six times.\r\n\r\nWe may now pass on to sketch rapidly the social conditions which\r\nprevailed in the period of the Rigveda. The family, in which such\r\nrelationships as a wife's brother and a husband's brother or sister had\r\nspecial names, was clearly the foundation of society. The father was\r\nat its head as \"lord of the house\" (grihapati). Permission to marry a\r\ndaughter was asked from him by the suitor through the mediation of an\r\nintimate friend. The wedding was celebrated in the house of the bride's\r\nparents, whither the bridegroom, his relatives, and friends came in\r\nprocession. Here they were entertained with the flesh of cows slain in\r\nhonour of the occasion. Here, too, the bridegroom took the bride's hand\r\nand led her round the nuptial fire. The Atharva-veda adds that he set\r\ndown a stone on the ground, asking the bride to step upon it for the\r\nobtainment of offspring. On the conclusion of the wedding festivities,\r\nthe bride, anointed and in festal array, mounted with her husband a\r\ncar adorned with red flowers and drawn by two white bulls. On this\r\nshe was conducted in procession to her new home. The main features\r\nof this nuptial ceremony of 3000 years ago still survive in India.\r\n\r\nThough the wife, like the children, was subject to the will of her\r\nhusband, she occupied a position of greater honour in the age of the\r\nRigveda than in that of the Brahmanas, for she participated with her\r\nhusband in the offering of sacrifice. She was mistress of the house\r\n(grihapatni), sharing the control not only of servants and slaves,\r\nbut also of the unmarried brothers and sisters of her husband. From\r\nthe Yajurveda we learn that it was customary for sons and daughters\r\nto marry in the order of their age, but the Rigveda more than once\r\nspeaks of girls who remained unmarried and grew old in their father's\r\nhouse. As the family could only be continued in the male line,\r\nabundance of sons is constantly prayed for, along with wealth in\r\ncattle and land, and the newly wedded husband hopes that his bride\r\nmay become a mother of heroes. Lack of sons was placed on the same\r\nlevel as poverty, and adoption was regarded as a mere makeshift. No\r\ndesire for the birth of daughters is ever expressed in the Rigveda;\r\ntheir birth is deprecated in the Atharva-veda, and the Yajurveda\r\nspeaks of girls being exposed when born. Fathers, even in the earliest\r\nVedic times, would doubtless have sympathised with the sentiment of\r\nthe Aitareya Brahmana, that \"to have a daughter is a misery.\" This\r\nprejudice survives in India to the present day with unabated force.\r\n\r\nThat the standard of morality was comparatively high may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that adultery and rape were counted among the most\r\nserious offences, and illegitimate births were concealed.\r\n\r\nOne or two passages indicate that the practice of exposing old men,\r\nfound among many primitive peoples, was not unknown to the Rigveda.\r\n\r\nAmong crimes, the commonest appears to have been robbery, which\r\ngenerally took the form of cattle-lifting, mostly practised at\r\nnight. Thieves and robbers are often mentioned, and the Rigveda\r\ncontains many prayers for protection at home, abroad, and on\r\njourneys. Such criminals, when caught, were punished by being tied\r\nto stakes with cords. Debts (rina) were often incurred, chiefly,\r\nit would seem, at play, and the Rigveda even speaks of paying them\r\noff by instalments.\r\n\r\nFrom the references to dress which the Rigveda contains we may\r\ngather that a lower garment and a cloak were worn. Clothes were woven\r\nof sheep's wool, were often variegated, and sometimes adorned with\r\ngold. Necklets, bracelets, anklets, and ear-rings are mentioned in the\r\nway of ornaments. The hair was anointed and combed. The Atharva-veda\r\neven mentions a comb with a hundred teeth, and also speaks of remedies\r\nwhich strengthened or restored the growth of the hair. Women plaited\r\ntheir hair, while men occasionally wore it braided and wound like a\r\nshell. The gods Rudra and Pushan are described as being thus adorned;\r\nand the Vasishthas, we learn, wore their hair braided on the right side\r\nof the head. On festive occasions wreaths were worn by men. Beards\r\nwere usual, but shaving was occasionally practised. The Atharva-veda\r\nrelates how, when the ceremony of shaving off his beard was performed\r\non King Soma, Vayu brought the hot water and Savitri skilfully wielded\r\nthe razor.\r\n\r\nThe chief article of food was milk, which was either drunk as it\r\ncame from the cow or was used for cooking grain as well as mixing\r\nwith soma. Next in importance came clarified butter (ghrita,\r\nnow ghee), which, as a favourite food of men, was also offered to\r\nthe gods. Grain was eaten after being parched, or, ground to flour\r\nbetween millstones, was made into cakes with milk or butter. Various\r\nkinds of vegetables and fruit also formed part of the daily fare\r\nof the Vedic Indian. Flesh was eaten only on ceremonial occasions,\r\nwhen animals were sacrificed. Bulls being the chief offerings\r\nto the gods, beef was probably the kind of meat most frequently\r\neaten. Horse-flesh must have been less commonly used, owing to the\r\ncomparative rarity of the horse-sacrifice. Meat was either roasted on\r\nspits or cooked in pots. The latter were made of metal or earthenware;\r\nbut drinking-vessels were usually of wood.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the Rigveda were acquainted with at least two kinds\r\nof spirituous liquor. Soma was the principal one. Its use was,\r\nhowever, restricted to occasions of a religious character, such as\r\nsacrifices and festivals. The genuine soma plant from which it was\r\nmade also became increasingly difficult to obtain as the Aryans\r\nmoved farther away from the mountains. The spirit in ordinary use\r\nwas called sura. The knowledge of it goes back to a remote period,\r\nfor its name, like that of soma, is found in the Avesta in the form\r\nof hura. It was doubtless prepared from some kind of grain, like the\r\nliquor made from rice at the present day in India. Indulgence in sura\r\nwent hand in hand with gambling. One poet mentions anger, dice, and\r\nsura as the causes of various sins; while another speaks of men made\r\narrogant with sura reviling the gods. Its use must have been common,\r\nfor by the time of the Vajasaneyi Samhita, the occupation of a \"maker\r\nof sura\" (surakara) or distiller had become a profession.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief occupations of the Vedic Indians was of course\r\nwarfare. They fought either on foot or on chariots. The latter had\r\ntwo occupants, the fighter and the driver. This was still the case\r\nin the Mahabharata, where we find Krishna acting as charioteer to\r\nArjuna. Cavalry is nowhere mentioned, and probably came into use at\r\na considerably later period. By the time of Alexander's invasion,\r\nhowever, it formed one of the regular four divisions of the Indian\r\narmy. There are some indications that riding on horseback was at\r\nleast known to the Rigveda, and distinct references to it occur in\r\nthe Atharva- and the Yajur-vedas. The Vedic warriors were protected\r\nwith coats of mail and helmets of metal. The principal weapons were\r\nthe bow and arrow, the latter being tipped with poisoned horn or with\r\na metal point. Spears and axes are also frequently mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe principal means of livelihood to the Vedic Indian was\r\ncattle-breeding. His great desire was to possess large herds; and in\r\nthe numerous prayers for protection, health, and prosperity, cattle\r\nare nearly always mentioned first.\r\n\r\nThe Vedic Aryans were, however, not merely a pastoral people. They\r\nhad brought with them from beyond the valleys of Afghanistan at least\r\na primitive knowledge of agriculture, as is shown by the Indians and\r\nIranians having such terms as \"to plough\" (krish) in common. This had,\r\nindeed, by the time of the Rigveda, become an industry second only to\r\ncattle-breeding in importance. The plough, which we learn from the\r\nAtharva-veda had a metal share, was used for making furrows in the\r\nfields, and was drawn by bulls. When the earth was thus prepared,\r\nseed was strewn over the soil. Irrigation seems not to have been\r\nunknown, as dug-out channels for water are mentioned. When ripe,\r\nthe corn (yava) was cut with a sickle. It was then laid in bundles\r\non the threshing-floor, where it was threshed out and finally sifted\r\nby winnowing.\r\n\r\nThough the Vedic Indians were already a pastoral and agricultural\r\npeople, they still practised hunting to a considerable extent. The\r\nhunter pursued his game with bow and arrow, or used traps and\r\nsnares. Birds were usually caught with toils or nets spread on the\r\nground. Lions were taken in snares, antelopes secured in pits, and\r\nboars hunted with dogs.\r\n\r\nNavigation in Rigvedic times was, as we have already seen, limited\r\nto the crossing of rivers. The boats (called nau-s, Greek nau-s) were\r\npropelled by what were doubtless paddles (aritra), and must have been\r\nof the most primitive type, probably dug-out tree-trunks. No mention\r\nis made of rudder or anchor, masts, or sails.\r\n\r\nTrade in those days consisted in barter, the cow being the pecuniary\r\nstandard by which the value of everything was measured. The transition\r\nto coinage was made by the use of gold ornaments and jewelry as a form\r\nof reward or payment, as was the case among the ancient Germans. Thus\r\nnishka, which in the Rigveda means a necklet, in later times became\r\nthe name of a coin.\r\n\r\nThough the requirements of life in early Vedic times were still\r\nprimitive enough to enable every man more or less to supply his own\r\nwants, the beginnings of various trades and industries can be clearly\r\ntraced in the Rigveda. References are particularly frequent to the\r\nlabour of the worker in wood, who was still carpenter, joiner, and\r\nwheelwright in one. As the construction of chariots and carts required\r\npeculiar skill, we find that certain men already devoted themselves\r\nto it as a special art, and worked at it for pay. Hence felicity in\r\nthe composition of hymns is often compared with the dexterity of the\r\nwheelwright. Mention is also sometimes made of the smith who smelts\r\nthe ore in a forge, using the wing of a bird instead of a bellows to\r\nproduce a draught. He is described as making kettles as well as other\r\ndomestic utensils of metal. The Rigveda also refers to tanners and the\r\nskins of animals prepared by them. Women, it appears, were acquainted\r\nwith sewing and with the plaiting of mats from grass or reeds. An art\r\nmuch more frequently alluded to in metaphors and similes is that of\r\nweaving, but the references are so brief that we obtain no insight\r\ninto the process. The Atharva-veda, however, gives some details in a\r\npassage which describes how Night and Day, personified as two sisters,\r\nweave the web of the year alternately with threads that never break\r\nor come to an end. The division of labour had been greatly developed\r\nby the time of the White Yajurveda, in which a great many trades\r\nand vocations are enumerated. Among these we find the rope-maker,\r\nthe jeweller, the elephant-keeper, and the actor.\r\n\r\nAmong the active and warlike Vedic Aryans the chariot-race was a\r\nfavourite amusement, as is shown by the very metaphors which are\r\nborrowed from this form of sport. Though skilful driving was still\r\na highly esteemed art in the epic period, the use of the chariot\r\nboth for war and for racing gradually died out in Hindustan, partly\r\nperhaps owing to the enervating influence of the climate, and partly\r\nto the scarcity of horses, which had to be brought from the region\r\nof the Indus.\r\n\r\nThe chief social recreation of men when they met together was gambling\r\nwith dice. The irresistible fascination exercised, and the ruin often\r\nentailed by this amusement, we have already found described in the\r\nGambler's Lament. Some haunted the gaming-hall to such an extent that\r\nwe find them jocularly described in the Yajurveda as \"pillars of the\r\nplayhouse\" (sabhasthanu). No certain information can be gathered from\r\nthe Rigveda as to how the game was played. We know, however, from one\r\npassage that four dice were used. The Yajurveda mentions a game played\r\nwith five, each of which has a name. Cheating at play appears in the\r\nRigveda as one of the most frequent of crimes; and one poet speaks of\r\ndice as one of the chief sources of sinning against the ordinances of\r\nVaruna. Hence the word used in the Rigveda for \"gamester\" (kitava) in\r\nclassical Sanskrit came to mean \"cheat,\" and a later word for \"rogue\"\r\n(dhurta) is used as a synonym of \"gamester.\"\r\n\r\nAnother amusement was dancing, which seems to have been indulged in by\r\nmen as well as women. But when the sex of the dancers is distinctly\r\nreferred to, they are nearly always maidens. Thus the Goddess of\r\nDawn is compared to a dancer decked in gay attire. That dancing\r\ntook place in the open air may be gathered from the line (x. 76, 6),\r\n\"thick dust arose as from men who dance\" (nrityatam).\r\n\r\nVarious references in the Rigveda show that even in that early age the\r\nIndians were acquainted with different kinds off music. For we find\r\nthe three main types of percussion, wind, and stringed instruments\r\nthere represented by the drum (dundubhi), the flute (vana), and the\r\nlute (vina). The latter has ever since been the favourite musical\r\ninstrument of the Indians down to the present day. That the Vedic\r\nIndians were fond of instrumental music may be inferred from the\r\nstatement of a Rishi that the sound of the flute is heard in the\r\nabode of Yama, where the blessed dwell. From one of the Sutras we\r\nlearn that instrumental music was performed at some religious rites,\r\nthe vina being played at the sacrifice to the Manes. By the time of\r\nthe Yajurveda several kinds of professional musicians appear to have\r\narisen, for lute-players, drummers, flute-players, and conch-blowers\r\nare enumerated in its list of callings. Singing is, of course, very\r\noften mentioned in the Rigveda. That vocal music had already got beyond\r\nthe most primitive stage may be concluded from the somewhat complicated\r\nmethod of chanting the Samaveda, a method which was probably very\r\nancient, as the Soma ritual goes back to the Indo-Iranian age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE LATER VEDAS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the three later Vedas, the Samaveda is much the most closely\r\nconnected with the Rigveda. Historically it is of little importance,\r\nfor it contains hardly any independent matter, all its verses except\r\nseventy-five being taken directly from the Rigveda. Its contents are\r\nderived chiefly from the eighth and especially the ninth, the Soma\r\nbook. The Samaveda resembles the Yajurveda in having been compiled\r\nexclusively for ritual application; for the verses of which it\r\nconsists are all meant to be chanted at the ceremonies of the soma\r\nsacrifice. Removed from their context in the Rigveda, they are strung\r\ntogether without internal connection, their significance depending\r\nsolely on their relation to particular rites. In form these stanzas\r\nappear in the text of the Samaveda as if they were to be spoken or\r\nrecited, differing from those of the Rigveda only in the way of\r\nmarking the accent. The Samaveda is, therefore, only the book of\r\nwords employed by the special class of Ugatri priests at the soma\r\nsacrifice. Its stanzas assume their proper character of musical Samans\r\nor chants only in the various song-books called ganas, which indicate\r\nthe prolongation, the repetition, and the interpolation of syllables\r\nnecessary in singing, just as is often done in European publications\r\nwhen the words are given below the musical notation. There are four\r\nof these songbooks in existence, two belonging to each division of\r\nthe Veda. The number of Samans here given of course admitted of being\r\nindefinitely increased, as each verse could be sung to many melodies.\r\n\r\nThe Samaveda consists of 1549 stanzas, distributed in two books called\r\narchikas or collections of rich verses. The principle of arrangement\r\nin these two books is different. The first is divided into six lessons\r\n(prapathaka), each of which contains ten decades (daçat) of stanzas,\r\nexcept the sixth, which has only nine. The verses of the first twelve\r\ndecades are addressed to Agni, those of the last eleven to Soma,\r\nwhile those of the intermediate thirty-six are chiefly invocations\r\nof Indra, the great soma-drinker. The second book contains nine\r\nlessons, each of which is divided into two, and sometimes three\r\nsections. It consists throughout of small groups of stanzas, which,\r\ngenerally three in number, are closely connected, the first in the\r\ngroup being usually found in the first book also. That the second book\r\nis both later in date and secondary in character is indicated by its\r\nrepeating stanzas from the first book as well as by its deviating much\r\nless from the text of the Rigveda. It is also a significant fact in\r\nthis connection that the verses of the first book which recur in the\r\nsecond agree more closely with the readings of the Rigveda than the\r\nother verses by which they are surrounded. This can only be accounted\r\nfor by the supposition that they were consciously altered in order to\r\naccord with the same verses in the second book which were directly\r\ninfluenced by the Rigveda, while the readings of the first book had\r\ndiverged more widely because that book had been handed down, since\r\nthe original borrowing, by an independent tradition.\r\n\r\nWe know from statements of the Çatapatha Brahmana that the divisions\r\nof the first book of the Samaveda existed at least as early as the\r\nperiod when the second part of that Brahmana was composed. There is,\r\nmoreover, some reason to believe that the Samaveda as a collection is\r\nolder than at least the Taittiriya and the Vajasaneyi recensions of the\r\nYajurveda. For the latter contain verses, used also as Saman chants,\r\nin a form which shows the variations of the Samaveda in contrast with\r\nthe Rigveda. This is all the more striking as the Vajasaneyi text has\r\nan undoubted tendency to adhere to the readings of the Rigveda. On\r\nthe other hand, the view expressed by Professor Weber that numerous\r\nvariants in verses of the Samaveda contain archaic forms as compared\r\nwith the Rigveda, and were therefore borrowed at a time before the\r\nexisting redaction of the Rigveda took place, has been shown to be\r\nuntenable. The various readings of the Samaveda are really due in\r\npart to inferior tradition, and in part to arbitrary alterations made\r\nin order to adapt verses detached from their context to the ritual\r\npurpose to which they were applied.\r\n\r\nTwo schools of the Samaveda are known--the Kauthumas and the\r\nRanayaniyas, the former of whom are said still to exist in Gujarat,\r\nwhile the latter, at one time settled mainly in the Mahratta country,\r\nare said to survive in Eastern Hyderabad. Their recensions of the\r\ntext appear to have differed but little from each other. That of\r\nthe Ranayanayas has been published more than once. The earliest\r\nedition, brought out by a missionary named Stevenson in 1842,\r\nwas entirely superseded by the valuable work of Benfey, which,\r\ncontaining a German translation and glossary besides the text,\r\ncame out in 1848. The Samaveda was thus the first of the Vedas to\r\nbe edited in its entirety. The text of this Veda, according to the\r\nrecension of the same school, together with the commentary of Sayana,\r\nwas subsequently edited in India. Of the Kauthuma recension nothing has\r\nbeen preserved excepting the seventh prapathaka, which, in the Naigeya\r\nsubdivision of this school, forms an addition to the first archika,\r\nand was edited in 1868. Two indices of the deities and composers of the\r\nSamaveda according to the Naigeya school have also been preserved, and\r\nindirectly supply information about the text of the Kauthuma recension.\r\n\r\nThe Yajurveda introduces us not only to a geographical area different\r\nfrom that of the Rigveda, but also to a new epoch of religious\r\nand social life in India. The centre of Vedic civilisation is now\r\nfound to lie farther to the east. We hear no more of the Indus and\r\nits tributaries; for the geographical data of all the recensions of\r\nthe Yajurveda point to the territory in the middle of Northern India\r\noccupied by the neighbouring peoples of the Kurus and Panchalas. The\r\ncountry of the former, called Kurukshetra, is specifically the holy\r\nland of the Yajurvedas and of the Brahmanas attached to them. It lay\r\nin the plain between the Sutlej and the Jumna, beginning with the\r\ntract bounded by the two small rivers Drishadvati and Sarasvati,\r\nand extending south-eastwards to the Jumna. It corresponds to the\r\nmodern district of Sirhind. Closely connected with, and eastward\r\nof this region, was situated the land of the Panchalas, which,\r\nrunning south-east from the Meerut district to Allahabad, embraces\r\nthe territory between the Jumna and the Ganges called the Doab (\"Two\r\nWaters\"). Kurukshetra was the country in which the Brahmanic religious\r\nand social system was developed, and from which it spread over the rest\r\nof India. It claims a further historical interest as being in later\r\ntimes the scene of the conflict, described in the Mahabharata, between\r\nthe Panchalas and Matsyas on the one hand, and the Kurus, including\r\nthe ancient Bharatas, on the other. In the famous lawbook of Manu the\r\nland of the Kurus is still regarded with veneration as the special\r\nhome of Brahmanism, and as such is designated Brahmavarta. Together\r\nwith the country of the Panchalas, and that of their neighbours to the\r\nsouth of the Jumna, the Matsyas (with Mathura, now Muttra, as their\r\ncapital) and the Çurasenas, it is spoken of as the land of Brahman\r\nsages, where the bravest warriors and the most pious priests live,\r\nand the customs and usages of which are authoritative.\r\n\r\nHere the adherents of the Yajurveda split up into several schools,\r\nwhich gradually spread over other parts of India, the Kathas, with\r\ntheir subdivision the Kapishthalas, being in the time of the Greeks\r\nlocated in the Panjab, and later in Kashmir also. The Kathas are now\r\nto be found in Kashmir only, while the Kapishthalas have entirely\r\ndisappeared. The Maitrayaniyas, originally called Kalapas, appear\r\nat one time to have occupied the region around the lower course of\r\nthe Narmada for a distance of some two hundred miles from the sea,\r\nextending to the south of its mouth more than a hundred miles, as far\r\nas Naasik, and northwards beyond the modern city of Baroda. There are\r\nnow only a few remnants of this school to the north of the Narmada in\r\nGujarat, chiefly at Ahmedabad, and farther west at Morvi. Before the\r\nbeginning of our era these two ancient schools must have been very\r\nwidely diffused in India. For the grammarian Patanjali speaks of the\r\nKathas and Kalapas as the universally known schools of the Yajurveda,\r\nwhose doctrines were proclaimed in every village. From the Ramayana,\r\nmoreover, we learn that these two schools were highly honoured in\r\nAyodhya (Oudh) also. They were, however, gradually ousted by the two\r\nyounger schools of the Yajurveda. Of these, the Taittiriyas have been\r\nfound only to the south of the Narmada, where they can be traced as\r\nfar back as the fourth century A.D. Their most important subdivision,\r\nthat of the Apastambas, still survives in the territory of the\r\nGodavari, while another, the Hiranyakeçins, are found still farther\r\nsouth. The school of the Vajasaneyins spread towards the south-east,\r\ndown the Ganges Valley. At the present day they occupy a wide area,\r\nembracing North-East and Central India.\r\n\r\nEach of these four schools has preserved one or two recensions of the\r\nYajurveda. The text of the Maitrayani Samhita, which consists of four\r\nbooks (kanda), subdivided into fifty-four lessons (prapathaka), has\r\nbeen edited by Professor L. v. Schroeder (1881-86). The same scholar\r\nis preparing an edition of the Kathaka Samhita, the recension of the\r\nKatha school. These two recensions are nearly related in language,\r\nhaving many forms in common which are not found elsewhere. Of\r\nthe Kapishthala-Katha Samhita only somewhat corrupt fragments have\r\nhitherto come to light, and it is very doubtful whether sufficient\r\nmanuscript material will ever be discovered to render an edition of\r\nthis text possible. The Taittiriya Samhita, which comprises seven\r\nbooks, and is subdivided into forty-four lessons, is somewhat later\r\nin origin than the above-mentioned recensions. It was edited by\r\nProfessor A. Weber in 1871-72. These texts of the Yajurveda form\r\na closely connected group, for they are essentially the same in\r\ncharacter. Their agreement is often even verbal, especially in the\r\nverses and formulas for recitation which they contain. They also\r\nagree in arranging their matter according to a similar principle,\r\nwhich is different from that of the Vajasaneyi recension.\r\n\r\nThe Samhita of the latter consists entirely of the verses and\r\nformulas to be recited at the sacrifice, and is therefore clear\r\n(çukla), that is to say, separated from the explanatory matter\r\nwhich is collected in the Brahmana. Hence it is called the White\r\n(çukla) Yajurveda, while the others, under the general name of Black\r\n(krishna) Yajurveda, are contrasted with it, as containing both kinds\r\nof matter mixed up in the Samhita. The text of the Vajasaneyins has\r\nbeen preserved in two recensions, that of the Madhyamdinas and of the\r\nKanvas. These are almost identical in their subject-matter as well\r\nas its arrangement. Their divergences hardly go beyond varieties\r\nof reading, which, moreover, appear only in their prose formulas,\r\nnot in their verses. Agreeing thus closely, they cannot be separated\r\nin their origin by any wide interval of time. Their discrepancies\r\nprobably arose rather from geographical separation, since each has\r\nits own peculiarities of spelling. The White Yajurveda in both these\r\nrecensions has been edited by Professor Weber (1849-52).\r\n\r\nIt is divided into forty chapters, called adhyayas. That it\r\noriginally consisted of the first eighteen alone is indicated by\r\nexternal as well as internal evidence. This is the only portion\r\ncontaining verses and prose formulas (both having the common name of\r\nmantras) which recur in the Taittiriya Samhita, the sole exceptions\r\nbeing a few passages relating to the horse-sacrifice in chapters\r\n22-25. Otherwise the contents of the last twenty-two chapters are\r\nfound again only in the Brahmana and the Aranyaka belonging to the\r\nTaittiriya Samhita. Moreover, it is only the mantras of the first\r\neighteen chapters of the Vajasaneyi Samhita which are quoted and\r\nexplained word by word in the first nine books of its own Brahmana,\r\nwhile merely a few mantras from the following seventeen chapters\r\nare mentioned in that work. According to the further testimony of\r\nan ancient index of the White Yajurveda, attributed to Katyayana,\r\nthe ten chapters 26-35 form a supplement (khila).\r\n\r\nThe internal evidence of the Vajasaneyi Samhita leads to similar\r\nconclusions. The fact that chapters 26-29 contain mantras relating to\r\nceremonies dealt with in previous chapters and requiring to be applied\r\nto those ceremonies, is a clear indication of their supplementary\r\ncharacter. The next ten chapters (30-39) are concerned with altogether\r\nnew ceremonies, such as the human sacrifice, the universal sacrifice,\r\nand the sacrifice to the Manes. Lastly, the 40th chapter must be a\r\nlate addition, for it stands in no direct relation to the ritual and\r\nbears the character of an Upanishad. Different parts of the Samhita,\r\nmoreover, furnish some data pointing to different periods of religious\r\nand social development. In the 16th chapter the god Rudra is described\r\nby a large number of epithets which are subsequently peculiar\r\nto Çiva. Two, however, which are particularly significant, Içana,\r\n\"Ruler,\" and Mahadeva, \"Great God,\" are absent here, but are added in\r\nthe 39th chapter. These, as indicating a special worship of the god,\r\nrepresent a later development. Again, the 30th chapter specifies\r\nmost of the Indian mixed castes, while the 16th mentions only a few\r\nof them. Hence, it is likely that at least some which are known to\r\nthe former chapter did not as yet exist when the latter was composed.\r\n\r\nOn these grounds four chronological strata may be distinguished in\r\nthe White Yajurveda. To the fundamental portion, comprising chapters\r\n1-18, the next seven must first have been added, for these two parts\r\ndeal with the general sacrificial ceremonial. The development of the\r\nritual led to the compilation of the next fourteen chapters, which\r\nare concerned with ceremonies already treated (26-29) or entirely new\r\n(30-39). The last chapter apparently dates from a period when the\r\nexcessive growth of ritual practices led to a reaction. It does not\r\nsupply sacrificial mantras, but aims at establishing a mean between\r\nexclusive devotion to and total neglect of the sacrificial ceremonies.\r\n\r\nEven the original portion of the White Yajurveda must have assumed\r\nshape somewhat later than any of the recensions of the Black. For the\r\nsystematic and orderly distribution of matter by which the mantras\r\nare collected in the Samhita, while their dogmatic explanation is\r\nentirely relegated to a Brahmana, can hardly be as old as the confused\r\narrangement in which both parts are largely mixed up.\r\n\r\nThe two most important portions of the Yajurvedas deal with the new and\r\nfull moon sacrifices, as well as the soma sacrifice, on the one hand,\r\nand with the construction of the fire-altar on the other. Chapters\r\n1-10 of the White Yajurveda contain the mantras for the former,\r\nchapters 11-18 those for the latter part of the ceremonial. The\r\ncorresponding ritual explanations are to be found in books 1-5 and 6-9\r\nrespectively of the Çatapatha Brahmana. In these fundamental portions\r\neven the Black Yajurveda does not intermingle the mantras with their\r\nexplanations. The first book of the Taittiriya Samhita contains in\r\nits first four lessons nothing but the verses and formulas to be\r\nrecited at the fortnightly and the soma sacrifices; the fourth book,\r\nnothing but those employed in the fire-altar ritual. These books follow\r\nthe same order as, and in fact furnish a parallel recension of, the\r\ncorresponding parts of the Vajasaneyi Samhita. On the other hand, the\r\nTaittiriya Samhita contains within itself, but in a different part,\r\nthe two corresponding Brahmanas, which, on the whole, are free from\r\nadmixture with mantras. The fifth book is the Brahmana of the fire\r\nritual, and the sixth is that of the soma sacrifice; but the dogmatic\r\nexplanation of the new and full moon sacrifice is altogether omitted\r\nhere, being found in the third book of the Taittiriya Brahmana. In\r\nthe Maitrayani Samhita the distribution of the corresponding material\r\nis similar. The first three lessons of the first book contain the\r\nmantras only for the fortnightly and the soma sacrifices; the latter\r\nhalf of the second book (lessons 7-13), the mantras only for the fire\r\nritual. The corresponding Brahmanas begin with the sixth and the first\r\nlesson respectively of the third book. It is only in the additions to\r\nthese fundamental parts of the Black Yajurveda that the separation of\r\nMantra and Brahmana is not carried out. The main difference, then,\r\nbetween the Black and the White consists in the former combining\r\nwithin the same collection Brahmana as well as Mantra matter. As to\r\nits chief and fundamental parts, there is no reason to suppose that\r\nthese two kinds of matter, which are kept separate and unmixed, are\r\neither chronologically or essentially more nearly related than are\r\nthe Vajasaneyi Samhita and the Çatapatha Brahmana.\r\n\r\nThe Yajurveda resembles the Samaveda in having been compiled for\r\napplication to sacrificial rites only. But while the Samaveda deals\r\nsolely with one part of the ritual, the soma sacrifice, the Yajurveda\r\nsupplies the formulas for the whole sacrificial ceremonial. Like\r\nthe Samaveda, it is also connected with the Rigveda; but while the\r\nformer is practically altogether extracted from the Rigveda, the\r\nYajurveda, though borrowing many of its verses from the same source,\r\nis largely an original production. Thus somewhat more than one-fourth\r\nonly of the Vajasaneyi Samhita is derived from the Rigveda, One half\r\nof this collection consists of verses (rich) most of which (upwards\r\nof 700) are found in the Rigveda; the other half is made up of prose\r\nformulas (yajus). The latter, as well as the verses not borrowed from\r\nthe Rigveda, are the independent creation of the composers of the\r\nYajurveda. This partial originality was indeed a necessary result of\r\nthe growth of entirely new ceremonies and the extraordinary development\r\nof ritual detail. It became impossible to obtain from the Rigveda\r\neven approximately suitable verses for these novel requirements.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Mantra portion of the Yajurveda, though distinctly\r\nrepresenting a later stage, yet on the whole agrees with that of\r\nthe Rigveda, while separated from that of classical Sanskrit by a\r\nconsiderable interval.\r\n\r\nOn its mythological side the religion of the Yajurveda does not\r\ndiffer essentially from that of the older Veda; for the pantheon is\r\nstill the same. Some important modifications in detail are, however,\r\napparent. The figure of Prajapati, only foreshadowed in the latest\r\nhymns of the Rigveda, comes more and more into the foreground as\r\nthe chief of the gods. The Rudra of the Rigveda has begun to appear\r\non the scene as Çiva, being several times mentioned by that name as\r\nwell as by other epithets later peculiar to Çiva, such as Çankara and\r\nMahadeva. Vishnu now occupies a somewhat more prominent position than\r\nin the Rigveda. A new feature is his constant identification with\r\nthe sacrifice. The demons, now regularly called Asuras, perpetually\r\nappear as a group of evil beings opposed to the good gods. Their\r\nconflicts with the latter play a considerable part in the myths of the\r\nYajurveda. The Apsarases, who, as a class of celestial nymphs endowed\r\nwith all the seductive charms of female beauty, occupy so important a\r\nplace in post-Vedic mythology, but are very rarely mentioned in the\r\nRigveda, begin to be more prominent in the Yajurveda, in which many\r\nof them are referred to by individual names.\r\n\r\nCertain religious conceptions have, moreover, been modified and\r\nnew rites introduced. Thus the word brahma, which in the Rigveda\r\nmeant simply \"devotion,\" has come to signify the essence of\r\nprayer and holiness, an advance towards its ultimate sense in the\r\nUpanishads. Again, snake-worship, which is unknown to the Rigveda,\r\nnow appears as an element in Indian religion. That, however, which\r\nimpresses on the Yajurveda the stamp of a new epoch is the character\r\nof the worship which it represents. The relative importance of\r\nthe gods and of the sacrifice in the older religion has now become\r\ninverted. In the Rigveda the object of devotion was the gods, for the\r\npower of bestowing benefits on mankind was believed to lie in their\r\nhands alone, while the sacrifice was only a means of influencing their\r\nwill in favour of the offerer. In the Yajurveda the sacrifice itself\r\nhas become the centre of thought and desire, its correct performance\r\nin every detail being all-important. Its power is now so great that\r\nit not merely influences, but compels the gods to do the will of\r\nthe officiating priest. By means of it the Brahmans may, in fact,\r\nbe said to hold the gods in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Yajurveda may be described as a kind of mechanical\r\nsacerdotalism. A crowd of priests conducts a vast and complicated\r\nsystem of external ceremonies, to which symbolical significance is\r\nattributed, and to the smallest minutiæ of which the greatest weight\r\nis attached. In this stifling atmosphere of perpetual sacrifice and\r\nritual, the truly religious spirit of the Rigveda could not possibly\r\nsurvive. Adoration of the power and beneficence of the gods, as well\r\nas the consciousness of guilt, is entirely lacking, every prayer\r\nbeing coupled with some particular rite and aiming solely at securing\r\nmaterial advantages. As a natural result, the formulas of the Yajurveda\r\nare full of dreary repetitions or variations of the same idea, and\r\nabound with half or wholly unintelligible interjections, particularly\r\nthe syllable om. The following quotation from the Maitrayani Samhita\r\nis a good example: Nidhayo va nidhayo va om va om va om va e ai om\r\nsvarnajyotih. Here only the last word, which means \"golden light,\"\r\nis translatable.\r\n\r\nThus the ritual could not fail to become more and more of a mystery\r\nto all who did not belong to the Brahman caste. To its formulas,\r\nno less than to the sacrifice itself, control over Nature as well\r\nas the supernatural powers is attributed. Thus there are certain\r\nformulas for the obtainment of victory; by means of these, it is said,\r\nIndra constantly vanquished the demons. Again, we learn that, if the\r\npriest pronounces a formula for rain while mixing a certain offering,\r\nhe causes the rain to stream down. Hence the formulas are regarded\r\nas having a kind of magical effect by exercising compulsion. Similar\r\nmiraculous powers later came to be attached to penance and asceticism\r\namong the Brahmans, and to holiness among the Buddhists. The formulas\r\nof the Yajurveda have not, as a rule, the form of prayers addressed to\r\nthe gods, but on the whole and characteristically consist of statements\r\nabout the result of employing particular rites and mantras. Together\r\nwith the corresponding ritual they furnish a complex mass of appliances\r\nready to hand for the obtainment of material welfare in general as\r\nwell as all sorts of special objects, such as cattle or a village. The\r\npresence of a priest capable of using the necessary forms correctly\r\nis of course always presupposed. The desires which several rites are\r\nmeant to fulfil amount to nothing more than childish absurdity. Thus\r\nsome of them aim at the obtainment of the year. Formulas to secure\r\npossession of the moon would have had equal practical value.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with the elaboration of the sacrificial ceremonial\r\nwent the growth and consolidation of the caste system, in which\r\nthe Brahmans secured the social as well as the religious supremacy,\r\nand which has held India enchained for more than two thousand five\r\nhundred years. Not only do we find the four castes firmly established\r\nas the main divisions of Indian society in the Yajurveda, but, as one\r\nof the later books of the Vajasaneyi Samhita shows, most of the mixed\r\ncastes known in later times are already found to exist. The social\r\nas well as the religious conditions of the Indian people, therefore,\r\nnow wear an aspect essentially differing from those revealed to us\r\nin the hymns of the Rigveda.\r\n\r\nThe Rig-, Sama-, and Yajur-vedas alone were originally recognised as\r\ncanonical collections. For they only were concerned with the great\r\nsacrificial ceremonial. The Atharva-veda, with the exception of the\r\nlast book, which was obviously added in order to connect it with\r\nthat ceremonial, is essentially unconnected with it. The ceremonial\r\nto which its hymns were practically applied is, with few exceptions,\r\nthat with which the Grihya Sutras deal, being domestic rites such as\r\nthose of birth, marriage, and death, or the political rites relating\r\nto the inauguration of kings. Taken as a whole, it is a heterogeneous\r\ncollection of spells. Its most salient teaching is sorcery, for it is\r\nmainly directed against hostile agencies, such as diseases, noxious\r\nanimals, demons, wizards, foes, oppressors of Brahmans. But it also\r\ncontains many spells of an auspicious character, such as charms to\r\nsecure harmony in family and village life, reconciliation of enemies,\r\nlong life, health, and prosperity, besides prayers for protection\r\non journeys, and for luck in gambling. Thus it has a double aspect,\r\nbeing meant to appease and bless as well as to curse.\r\n\r\nIn its main contents the Atharva-veda is more superstitious than\r\nthe Rigveda. For it does not represent the more advanced religious\r\nbeliefs of the priestly class, but is a collection of the most popular\r\nspells current among the masses, who always preserve more primitive\r\nnotions with regard to demoniac powers. The spirit which breathes in\r\nit is that of a prehistoric age. A few of its actual charms probably\r\ndate with little modification from the Indo-European period; for, as\r\nAdalbert Kuhn has shown, some of its spells for curing bodily ailments\r\nagree in purpose and content, as well as to some extent even in form,\r\nwith certain old German, Lettic, and Russian charms. But with regard\r\nto the higher religious ideas relating to the gods, it represents\r\na more recent and advanced stage than the Rigveda. It contains,\r\nindeed, more theosophic matter than any of the other Samhitas. For\r\nthe history of civilisation it is on the whole more interesting and\r\nimportant than the Rigveda itself.\r\n\r\nThe Atharva-veda is extant in the recensions of two different\r\nschools. That of the Paippaladas is, however, known in a single\r\nbirch-bark manuscript, which is ancient but inaccurate and mostly\r\nunaccented. It was discovered by Professor Bühler in Kashmir, and\r\nhas been described by Professor Roth in his tract Der Atharvaveda\r\nin Kaschmir (1875). It will probably soon be accessible to scholars\r\nin the form of a photographic reproduction published by Professor\r\nBloomfield. This recension is doubtless meant by the \"Paippalada\r\nMantras\" mentioned in one of the Pariçishtas or supplementary writings\r\nof the Atharva-veda.\r\n\r\nThe printed text, edited by Roth and Whitney in 1856, gives the\r\nrecension of the Çaunaka school. Nearly the whole of Sayana's\r\ncommentary to the Atharva-veda has been edited in India. Its chief\r\ninterest lies in the large number of readings supplied by it which\r\ndiffer from those of the printed edition of this Veda.\r\n\r\nThis Samhita is divided into twenty books, containing 730 hymns and\r\nabout 6000 stanzas. Some 1200 of the latter are derived from the\r\nRigveda, chiefly from the tenth, first, and eighth books, a few\r\nalso from each of the other books. Of the 143 hymns of Book XX.,\r\nall but twelve are taken bodily from the established text of the\r\nRigveda without any change. The matter borrowed from the Rigveda in\r\nthe other books shows considerable varieties of reading, but these,\r\nas in the other Samhitas, are of inferior value compared with the\r\ntext of the Rigveda. As is the case in the Yajurveda, a considerable\r\npart of the Atharva (about one-sixth) consists of prose. Upwards of\r\nfifty hymns, comprising the whole of the fifteenth and sixteenth,\r\nbesides some thirty hymns scattered in the other books, are entirely\r\nunmetrical. Parts or single stanzas of over a hundred other hymns\r\nare of a similar character.\r\n\r\nThat the Atharva-veda originally consisted of its first thirteen books\r\nonly is shown both by its arrangement and by its subject-matter. The\r\ncontents of Books I.-VII. are distributed according to the number of\r\nstanzas contained in the hymns. In Book I. they have on the average\r\nfour stanzas, in II. five, in III. six, in IV. seven, in V. eight\r\nto eighteen, in VI. three; and in VII. about half the hymns have\r\nonly one stanza each. Books VIII.-XIII. contain longer pieces. The\r\ncontents of all these thirteen books are indiscriminately intermingled.\r\n\r\nThe following five books, on the contrary, are arranged according to\r\nuniformity of subject-matter. Book XIV. contains the stanzas relating\r\nto the wedding rite, which consist largely of mantras from the tenth\r\nbook of the Rigveda. Book XV. is a glorification of the Supreme\r\nBeing under the name of Vratya, while XVI. and XVII. contain certain\r\nconjurations. The whole of XV. and nearly the whole of XVI., moreover,\r\nare composed in prose of the type found in the Brahmanas. Both\r\nXVI. and XVII. are very short, the former containing nine hymns\r\noccupying four printed pages, the latter consisting of only a single\r\nhymn, which extends to little more than two pages. Book XVIII. deals\r\nwith burial and the Manes. Like XIV., it derives most of its stanzas\r\nfrom the tenth book of the Rigveda. Both these books are, therefore,\r\nnot specifically Atharvan in character.\r\n\r\nThe last two books are manifestly late additions. Book XIX. consists\r\nof a mixture of supplementary pieces, part of the text of which is\r\nrather corrupt. Book XX., with a slight exception, contains only\r\ncomplete hymns addressed to Indra, which are borrowed directly and\r\nwithout any variation from the Rigveda. The fact that its readings are\r\nidentical with those of the Rigveda would alone suffice to show that\r\nit is of later date than the original books, the readings of which\r\nshow considerable divergences from those of the older Veda. There is,\r\nhowever, more convincing proof of the lateness of this book. Its matter\r\nrelates to the Soma ritual, and is entirely foreign to the spirit\r\nof the Atharva-veda. It was undoubtedly added to establish the claim\r\nof the Atharva to the position of a fourth Veda, by bringing it into\r\nconnection with the recognised sacrificial ceremonial of the three old\r\nVedas. This book, again, as well as the nineteenth, is not noticed in\r\nthe Pratiçakhya of the Atharva-veda. Both of them must, therefore, have\r\nbeen added after that work was composed. Excepting two prose pieces\r\n(48 and 49) the only original part of Book XX. is the so-called kuntapa\r\nhymns (127-136). These are allied to the danastutis of the Rigveda,\r\nthose panegyrics of liberal kings or sacrificers which were the\r\nforerunners of epic narratives in praise of warlike princes and heroes.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the Atharva, as a collection of some kind, when the\r\nlast books of the Çatapatha Brahmana (xi., xiii., xiv.), the Taittiriya\r\nBrahmana, and the Chhandogya Upanishad were composed, is proved by\r\nthe references to it in those works. In Patanjali's Mahabhashya the\r\nAtharva had already attained to such an assured position that it is\r\neven cited at the head of the Vedas, and occasionally as their only\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\nThe oldest name of this Veda is Atharvangirasah, a designation\r\noccurring in the text of the Atharva-veda, and found at the beginning\r\nof its MSS. themselves. This word is a compound formed of the names of\r\ntwo ancient families of priests, the Atharvans and Angirases. In the\r\nopinion of Professor Bloomfield the former term is here synonymous\r\nwith \"holy charms,\" as referring to auspicious practices, while the\r\nlatter is an equivalent of \"witchcraft charms.\" The term atharvan\r\nand its derivatives, though representing only its benevolent side,\r\nwould thus have come to designate the fourth Veda as a whole. In its\r\nplural form (atharvanah) the word in this sense is found several times\r\nin the Brahmanas, but in the singular it seems first to occur in an\r\nUpanishad. The adjective atharvana, first found as a neuter plural with\r\nthe sense of \"Atharvan hymns\" in the Atharva-veda itself (Book XIX.),\r\nis common from that time onwards. The name atharva-veda first appears\r\nin Sutras about as early as rigveda and similar designations of the\r\nother Samhitas. There are besides two other names of the Atharva-veda,\r\nthe use of which is practically limited to the ritual texts of this\r\nVeda. In one of these, Bhrigu-angirasah, the name of another ancient\r\nfamily of fire-priests, the Bhrigus, takes the place of that of the\r\nAngirases. The other, brahma-veda, has outside the Atharvan literature\r\nonly been found once, and that in a Grihya Sutra of the Rigveda.\r\n\r\nA considerable time elapsed before the Atharva-veda, owing to\r\nthe general character of its contents, attained to the rank of a\r\ncanonical book. There is no evidence that even at the latest period\r\nof the Rigveda the charms constituting the Atharva-veda were formally\r\nrecognised as a separate literary category. For the Purusha hymn, while\r\nmentioning the three sacrificial Vedas by the names of Rik, Saman,\r\nand Yajus, makes no reference to the spells of the Atharva-veda. Yet\r\nthe Rigveda, though it is mainly concerned with praises of the gods in\r\nconnection with the sacrifice, contains hymns showing that sorcery was\r\nbound up with domestic practices from the earliest times in India. The\r\nonly reference to the spells of the Atharva-veda as a class in the\r\nYajurvedas is found in the Taittiriya Samhita, where they are alluded\r\nto under the name of angirasah by the side of Rik, Saman, and Yajus,\r\nwhich it elsewhere mentions alone. Yet the formulas of the Yajur-veda\r\nare often pervaded by the spirit of the Atharva-veda, and are sometimes\r\nAtharvan even in their wording. In fact, the difference between the\r\nRigveda and Yajurveda on the one hand, and the Atharva on the other,\r\nas regards sorcery, lies solely in the degree of its applicability\r\nand prominence.\r\n\r\nThe Atharva-veda itself only once mentions its own literary type\r\ndirectly (as atharvangirasah) and once indirectly (as bheshaja or\r\n\"auspicious spells\"), by the side of the other three Vedas, while\r\nthe latter in a considerable number of passages are referred to\r\nalone. This shows that as yet there was no feeling of antagonism\r\nbetween the adherents of this Veda and those of the older ones.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Brahmanas, we find that those of the Rigveda do\r\nnot mention the Atharva-veda at all, while the Taittiriya Brahmana\r\n(like the Taittiriya Aranyaka) refers to it twice. In the Çatapatha\r\nBrahmana it appears more frequently, occupying a more defined position,\r\nthough not that of a Veda. This work very often mentions the three\r\nold Vedas alone, either explicitly as Rik, Saman, Yajus, or as trayi\r\nvidya, \"the threefold knowledge.\" In several passages they are also\r\nmentioned along with other literary types, such as itihasa (story),\r\npurana (ancient legend), gatha (song), sutra, and upanishad. In these\r\nenumerations the Atharva-veda regularly occupies the fourth place,\r\ncoming immediately after the three Vedas, while the rest follow in\r\nvarying order. The Upanishads in general treat the Atharva-veda in the\r\nsame way; the Upanishads of the Atharva itself, however, sometimes\r\ntacitly add its name after the three Vedas, even without mentioning\r\nother literary types. With regard to the Çrauta or sacrificial Sutras,\r\nwe find no reference to the Atharva in those of Katyayana (White\r\nYajurveda) or Latyayana (Samaveda), and only one each in those of\r\nÇankhayana and Açvalayana (Rigveda).\r\n\r\nIn all this sacrificial literature there is no evidence of repugnance\r\nto the Atharva, or of exclusiveness towards it on the part of\r\nfollowers of the other Vedas. Such an attitude could indeed hardly\r\nbe expected. For though the sphere of the Vedic sacrificial ritual\r\nwas different from that of regular magical rites, it is impossible\r\nto draw a distinct line of demarcation between sacrifice and sorcery\r\nin the Vedic religion, of which witchcraft is, in fact, an essential\r\nelement. The adherents of the three sacrificial Vedas would thus\r\nnaturally recognise a work which was a repository of witchcraft. Thus\r\nthe Çatapatha Brahmana, though characterising yatu or sorcery as\r\ndevilish--doubtless because it may be dangerous to those who practise\r\nit--places yatuvidah or sorcerers by the side of bahvrichas or men\r\nskilled in Rigvedic verses. Just as the Rigveda contains very few\r\nhymns directly connected with the practice of sorcery, so the Atharva\r\noriginally included only matters incidental and subsidiary to the\r\nsacrificial ritual. Thus it contains a series of formulas (vi. 47-48)\r\nwhich have no meaning except in connection with the three daily\r\npressings (savana) of soma. We also find in it hymns (e. g. vi. 114)\r\nwhich evidently consist of formulas of expiation for faults committed\r\nat the sacrifice. We must therefore conclude that the followers of the\r\nAtharva to some extent knew and practised the sacrificial ceremonial\r\nbefore the conclusion of the present redaction of their hymns. The\r\nrelation of the Atharva to the çrauta rites was, however, originally\r\nso slight, that it became necessary, in order to establish a direct\r\nconnection with it, to add the twentieth book, which was compiled\r\nfrom the Rigveda for the purposes of the sacrificial ceremonial.\r\n\r\nThe conspicuous way in which çrauta works ignore the Atharva is\r\ntherefore due to its being almost entirely unconnected with the\r\nsubject-matter of the sacrifice, not to any pronounced disapproval\r\nor refusal to recognise its value in its own sphere. With the\r\nGrihya or Domestic Sutras, which contain many elements of sorcery\r\npractice (vidhana), we should expect the Atharva to betray a\r\ncloser connection. This is, indeed, to some extent the case; for\r\nmany verses quoted in these Sutras are identical with or variants\r\nof those contained in the Atharva, even though the Domestic,\r\nlike the Sacrificial, Sutras endeavoured to borrow their verses\r\nas far as possible from the particular Veda to which they were\r\nattached. Otherwise, however, their references to the Atharva betray\r\nno greater regard for it than those in the Sacrificial Sutras do. Such\r\nreferences to the fourth Veda are here, it is true, more frequent\r\nand formulaic; but this appears to mean nothing more than that the\r\nGrihya Sutras belong to a later date.\r\n\r\nIn the sphere, too, of law (dharma), as dealing with popular usage and\r\ncustom, the practices of the Atharva maintained a certain place; for\r\nthe indispensable sciences of medicine and astrology were distinctively\r\nAtharvan, and the king's domestic chaplain (purohita), believed capable\r\nof rendering great services in the injury and overthrow of enemies by\r\nsorcery, seems usually to have been an Atharvan priest. At the same\r\ntime it is only natural that we should first meet with censures of\r\nthe practices of the Atharva in the legal literature, because such\r\npractices were thought to enable one man to harm another. The verdict\r\nof the law treatises on the whole is, that as incantations of various\r\nkinds are injurious, the Atharva-veda is inferior and its practices\r\nimpure. This inferiority is directly expressed in the Dharma Sutra\r\nof Apastamba; and the later legal treatise (smriti) of Vishnu classes\r\nthe reciter of a deadly incantation from the Atharva among the seven\r\nkinds of assassins. Physicians and astrologers are pronounced impure;\r\npractices with roots are prohibited; sorceries and imprecations\r\nare punished with severe penances. In certain cases, however,\r\nthe Atharva-veda is stated to be useful. Thus the Lawbook of Manu\r\nrecommends it as the natural weapon of the Brahman against his enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the Mahabharata we find the importance and the canonical character\r\nof the Atharva fully recognised. The four Vedas are often mentioned,\r\nthe gods Brahma and Vishnu being in several passages described as\r\nhaving created them. The Atharva is here often also referred to\r\nalone, and spoken of with approbation. Its practices are well known\r\nand seldom criticised adversely, magic and sorcery being, as a rule,\r\nregarded as good.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Puranas not only regularly speak of the fourfold Veda,\r\nbut assign to the Atharva the advanced position claimed for it by its\r\nown ritual literature. Thus the Vishnu Purana connects the Atharva\r\nwith the fourth priest (the brahman) of the sacrificial ritual.\r\n\r\nNevertheless a certain prejudice has prevailed against the Atharva from\r\nthe time of the Dharma Sutras. This appears from the fact that, even at\r\nthe present day, according to Burnell, the most influential Brahmans\r\nof Southern India still refuse to accept the authority of the fourth\r\nVeda, and deny its genuineness. A similar conclusion may be drawn\r\nfrom occasional statements in classical texts, and especially from\r\nthe efforts of the later Atharvan writings themselves to vindicate the\r\ncharacter of their Veda. These ritual texts not only never enumerate\r\nthe Vedas without including the Atharva, but even sometimes place\r\nit at the head of the four Vedas. Under a sense of the exclusion of\r\ntheir Veda from the sphere of the sacrificial ritual, they lay claim\r\nto the fourth priest (the brahman), who in the Vedic religion was\r\nnot attached to any of the three Vedas, but being required to have a\r\nknowledge of all three and of their sacrificial application, acted as\r\nsuperintendent or director of the sacrificial ceremonial. Ingeniously\r\navailing themselves of the fact that he was unconnected with any of\r\nthe three Vedas, they put forward the claim of the fourth Veda as the\r\nspecial sphere of the fourth priest. That priest, moreover, was the\r\nmost important as possessing a universal knowledge of religious lore\r\n(brahma), the comprehensive esoteric understanding of the nature\r\nof the gods and of the mystery of the sacrifice. Hence the Gopatha\r\nBrahmana exalts the Atharva as the highest religious lore (brahma),\r\nand calls it the Brahmaveda. The claim to the latter designation\r\nwas doubtless helped by the word brahma often occurring in the\r\nAtharva-veda itself with the sense of \"charm,\" and by the fact that\r\nthe Veda contains a larger amount of theosophic matter (brahmavidya)\r\nthan any other Samhita. The texts belonging to the other Vedas never\r\nsuggest that the Atharva is the sphere of the fourth priest, some\r\nBrahmana passages expressly declaring that any one equipped with the\r\nrequisite knowledge maybe a brahman. The ritual texts of the Atharva\r\nfurther energetically urged that the Purohita, or domestic chaplain,\r\nshould be a follower of the Atharva-veda. They appear to have finally\r\nsucceeded in their claim to this office, doubtless because kings\r\nattached great value to a special knowledge of witchcraft.\r\n\r\nThe geographical data contained in the Atharva are but few, and\r\nfurnish no certain evidence as to the region in which its hymns were\r\ncomposed. One hymn of its older portion (v. 22) makes mention of the\r\nGandharis, Mujavats, Mahavrishas, and Balhikas (in the north-west),\r\nand the Magadhas and Angas (in the east); but they are referred to\r\nin such a way that no safe conclusions can be drawn as to the country\r\nin which the composer of the hymn in question lived.\r\n\r\nThe Atharva also contains a few astronomical data, the lunar mansions\r\nbeing enumerated in the nineteenth book. The names here given deviate\r\nconsiderably from those mentioned in the Taittiriya Samhita, appearing\r\nmostly in a later form. The passage in which this list is found is,\r\nhowever, a late addition.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Atharva is, from a grammatical point of view,\r\ndecidedly later than that of the Rigveda, but earlier than that of\r\nthe Brahmanas. In vocabulary it is chiefly remarkable for the large\r\nnumber of popular words which it contains, and which from lack of\r\nopportunity do not appear elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the hymns of the Atharva, though some of them\r\nmust be very old, were not edited till after the Brahmanas of the\r\nRigveda were composed.\r\n\r\nOn examining the contents of the Atharva-veda more in detail, we\r\nfind that the hostile charms it contains are directed largely against\r\nvarious diseases or the demons which are supposed to cause them. There\r\nare spells to cure fever (takman), leprosy, jaundice, dropsy, scrofula,\r\ncough, ophthalmia, baldness, lack of vital power; fractures and wounds;\r\nthe bite of snakes or injurious insects, and poison in general; mania\r\nand other ailments. These charms are accompanied by the employment of\r\nappropriate herbs. Hence the Atharva is the oldest literary monument\r\nof Indian medicine.\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen of a charm against cough (vi. 105):--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Just as the soul with soul-desires\r\n    Swift to a distance flies away,\r\n    So even thou, O cough, fly forth\r\n    Along the soul's quick-darting course.\r\n\r\n    Just as the arrow, sharpened well,\r\n    Swift to a distance flies away,\r\n    So even thou, O cough, fly forth\r\n    Along the broad expanse of earth.\r\n\r\n    Just as the sun-god's shooting rays\r\n    Swift to a distance fly away,\r\n    So even thou, O cough, fly forth\r\n    Along the ocean's surging flood.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a spell for the cure of leprosy by means of a dark-coloured\r\nplant:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Born in the night art thou, O herb,\r\n    Dark-coloured, sable, black of hue:\r\n    Rich-tinted, tinge this leprosy,\r\n    And stain away its spots of grey! (i. 23, 1).\r\n\r\n\r\nA large number of imprecations are directed against demons, sorcerers,\r\nand enemies. The following two stanzas deal with the latter two\r\nclasses respectively:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bend round and pass us by, O curse,\r\n    Even as a burning fire a lake.\r\n    Here strike him down that curses us,\r\n    As heaven's lightning smites the tree (vi. 37, 2).\r\n\r\n    As, rising in the east, the sun\r\n    The stars' bright lustre takes away,\r\n    So both of women and of men,\r\n    My foes, the strength I take away (vii. 13, 1).\r\n\r\n\r\nA considerable group of spells consists of imprecations directed\r\nagainst the oppressors of Brahmans and those who withhold from them\r\ntheir rightful rewards. The following is one of the threats held out\r\nagainst such evil-doers:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Water with which they bathe the dead,\r\n    And that with which they wet his beard,\r\n    The gods assigned thee as thy share,\r\n    Oppressor of the Brahman priest (v. 19, 14).\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother group of charms is concerned with women, being intended\r\nto secure their love with the aid of various potent herbs. Some of\r\nthem are of a hostile character, being meant to injure rivals. The\r\nfollowing two stanzas belong to the former class:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    As round this heaven and earth the sun\r\n    Goes day by day, encircling them,\r\n    So do I go around thy mind,\r\n    That, woman, thou shalt love me well,\r\n    And shalt not turn away from me (vi. 8, 3).\r\n\r\n    'Tis winged with longing, barbed with love,\r\n    Its shaft is formed of fixed desire:\r\n    With this his arrow levelled well\r\n    Shall Kama pierce thee to the heart (iii. 25, 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the auspicious charms of the Atharva there are many prayers\r\nfor long life and health, for exemption from disease and death:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    If life in him declines or has departed,\r\n    If on the very brink of death he totters,\r\n    I snatch him from the lap of Dissolution,\r\n    I free him flow to live a hundred autumns (iii. 11, 2).\r\n\r\n    Rise up from hence, O man, and straightway casting\r\n    Death's fetters from thy feet, depart not downward;\r\n    From life upon this earth be not yet sundered,\r\n    Nor from the sight of Agni and the sunlight (viii. 1, 4).\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother class of hymns includes prayers for protection from dangers and\r\ncalamities, or for prosperity in the house or field, in cattle, trade,\r\nand even gambling. Here are two spells meant to secure luck at play:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    As at all times the lightning stroke\r\n    Smites irresistibly the tree:\r\n    So gamesters with the dice would I\r\n    Beat irresistibly to-day (vii. 5, 1).\r\n\r\n    O dice, give play that profit brings,\r\n    Like cows that yield abundant milk:\r\n    Attach me to a streak of gain,\r\n    As with a string the bow is bound (vii. 5, 9).\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain number of hymns contain charms to secure harmony, to\r\nallay anger, strife, and discord, or to procure ascendency in the\r\nassembly. The following one is intended for the latter purpose:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    O assembly, we know thy name,\r\n    \"Frolic\" [9] truly by name thou art:\r\n    May all who meet and sit in thee\r\n    Be in their speech at one with me (vii. 12, 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nA few hymns consist of formulas for the expiation of sins, such as\r\noffering imperfect sacrifices and marrying before an elder brother,\r\nor contain charms for removing the defilement caused by ominous birds,\r\nand for banishing evil dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n    If waking, if asleep, I have\r\n    Committed sin, to sin inclined,\r\n    May what has been and what shall be\r\n    Loose me as from a wooden post (vi. 115, 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nA short hymn (vi. 120), praying for the remission of sins, concludes\r\nwith this stanza:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    In heaven, where our righteous friends are blessèd,\r\n    Having cast off diseases from their bodies,\r\n    From lameness free and not deformed in members,\r\n    There may we see our parents and our children.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother group of hymns has the person of the king as its centre. They\r\ncontain charms to be used at a royal election or consecration, for\r\nthe restoration of an exiled king, for the attainment of lustre and\r\nglory, and in particular for victory in battle. The following is a\r\nspecimen of spells intended to strike terror into the enemy:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Arise and arm, ye spectral forms,\r\n    Followed by meteoric flames;\r\n    Ye serpents, spirits of the deep,\r\n    Demons of night, pursue the foe! (xi. 10, 1).\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a stanza from a hymn (v. 21, 6) to the battle-drum meant to\r\nserve the same purpose:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    As birds start back affrighted at the eagle's cry,\r\n    As day and night they tremble at the lion's roar:\r\n    So thou, O drum, shout out against our enemies,\r\n    Scare them away in terror and confound their minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the cosmogonic and theosophic hymns the finest is a long one\r\nof sixty-three stanzas addressed to the earth (xii. 1). I translate\r\na few lines to give some idea of its style and contents:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The earth, on whom, with clamour loud,\r\n    Men that are mortal sing and dance,\r\n    On whom they fight in battle fierce:\r\n    This earth shall drive away from us our foemen,\r\n    And she shall make us free from all our rivals.\r\n\r\n    In secret places holding treasure manifold,\r\n    The earth shall riches give, and gems and gold to me:\r\n    Granting wealth lavishly, the kindly goddess\r\n    Shall goods abundantly bestow upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe four hymns of Book XIII. are devoted to the praise of Rohita,\r\nthe \"Red\" Sun, as a cosmogonic power. In another (xi. 5) the sun\r\nis glorified as a primeval principle under the guise of a Brahman\r\ndisciple (brahmacharin). In others Prana or Breath (xi. 4), Kama\r\nor Love (ix. 2), and Kala or Time (xix. 53-54), are personified as\r\nprimordial powers. There is one hymn (xi. 7) in which even Ucchishta\r\n(the remnant of the sacrifice) is deified as the Supreme Being; except\r\nfor its metrical form it belongs to the Brahmana type of literature.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this survey of the Atharva-veda, I would draw attention\r\nto a hymn to Varuna (iv. 16); which, though its last two stanzas are\r\nordinary Atharvan spells for binding enemies with the fetters of that\r\ndeity, in its remaining verses exalts divine omniscience in a strain\r\nunequalled in any other Vedic poem. The following three stanzas are\r\nperhaps the best:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    This earth is all King Varuna's dominion,\r\n    And that broad sky whose boundaries are distant.\r\n    The loins of Varuna are these two oceans,\r\n    Yet in this drop of water he is hidden.\r\n\r\n    He that should flee afar beyond the heaven\r\n    Would not escape King Varuna's attention:\r\n    His spies come hither, from the sky descending,\r\n    With all their thousand eyes the earth surveying.\r\n\r\n    King Varuna discerns all that's existent\r\n    Between the earth and sky, and all beyond them;\r\n    The winkings of men's eyes by him are counted;\r\n    As gamesters dice, so he lays down his statutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE BRAHMANAS\r\n\r\n(Circa 800-500 B.C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period in which the poetry of the Vedic Samhitas arose was\r\nfollowed by one which produced a totally different literary type--the\r\ntheological treatises called Brahmanas. It is characteristic of the\r\nform of these works that they are composed in prose, and of their\r\nmatter that they deal with the sacrificial ceremonial. Their main\r\nobject being to explain the sacred significance of the ritual to those\r\nwho are already familiar with the sacrifice, the descriptions they give\r\nof it are not exhaustive, much being stated only in outline or omitted\r\naltogether. They are ritual text-books, which, however, in no way aim\r\nat furnishing a complete survey of the sacrificial ceremonial to those\r\nwho do not know it already. Their contents may be classified under the\r\nthree heads of practical sacrificial directions (vidhi), explanations\r\n(arthavada), exegetical, mythological, or polemical, and theological or\r\nphilosophical speculations on the nature of things (upanishad). Even\r\nthose which have been preserved form quite an extensive literature by\r\nthemselves; yet many others must have been lost, as appears from the\r\nnumerous names of and quotations from Brahmanas unknown to us occurring\r\nin those which are extant. They reflect the spirit of an age in which\r\nall intellectual activity is concentrated on the sacrifice, describing\r\nits ceremonies, discussing its value, speculating on its origin and\r\nsignificance. It is only reasonable to suppose that an epoch like this,\r\nwhich produced no other literary monuments, lasted for a considerable\r\ntime. For though the Brahmanas are on the whole uniform in character,\r\ndifferences of age are traceable in them. Next to the prose portions\r\nof the Yajurvedas, the Panchavimça and the Taittiriya are proved by\r\ntheir syntax and vocabulary to be the most archaic of the regular\r\nBrahmanas. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the latter\r\nis, and the former is known to have been, accented. A more recent\r\ngroup is formed by the Jaiminiya, the Kaushitaki, and the Aitareya\r\nBrahmanas. The first of these is probably the oldest, while the\r\nthird seems, on linguistic grounds at least, to be the latest of the\r\nthree. The Çatapatha Brahmana, again, is posterior to these. For it\r\nshows a distinct advance in matter; its use of the narrative tenses is\r\nlater than that of the Aitareya; and its style is decidedly developed\r\nin comparison with all the above-mentioned Brahmanas. It is, indeed,\r\naccented, but in a way which differs entirely from the regular Vedic\r\nmethod. Latest of all are the Gopatha Brahmana of the Atharva and\r\nthe short Brahmanas of the Samaveda.\r\n\r\nIn language the Brahmanas are considerably more limited in the use of\r\nforms than the Rigveda. The subjunctive is, however, still employed,\r\nas well as a good many of the old infinitives. Their syntax, indeed,\r\nrepresents the oldest Indian stage even better than the Rigveda,\r\nchiefly of course owing to the restrictions imposed by metre\r\non the style of the latter. The Brahmanas contain some metrical\r\npieces (gathas), which differ from the prose in which they are\r\nimbedded by certain peculiarities of their own and by a more archaic\r\ncharacter. Allied to these is a remarkable poem of this period, the\r\nSuparnadhyaya, an attempt, after the age of living Vedic poetry had\r\ncome to an end, to compose in the style of the Vedic hymns. It contains\r\nmany Vedic forms, and is accented, but it betrays its true character\r\nnot only by its many modern forms, but by numerous monstrosities due\r\nto unsuccessful imitation of the Vedic language.\r\n\r\nA further development are the Aranyakas or \"Forest Treatises,\" the\r\nlater age of which is indicated both by the position they occupy at the\r\nend of the Brahmanas and by their theosophical character. These works\r\nare generally represented as meant for the use of pious men who have\r\nretired to the forest and no longer perform sacrifices. According to\r\nthe view of Professor Oldenberg, they are, however, rather treatises\r\nwhich, owing to the superior mystic sanctity of their contents,\r\nwere intended to be communicated to the pupil by his teacher in the\r\nsolitude of the forest instead of in the village.\r\n\r\nIn tone and content the Aranyakas form a transition to the Upanishads,\r\nwhich are either imbedded in them, or more usually form their\r\nconcluding portion. The word upa-ni-shad (literally \"sitting down\r\nbeside\") having first doubtless meant \"confidential session,\" came to\r\nsignify \"secret or esoteric doctrine,\" because these works were taught\r\nto select pupils (probably towards the end of their apprenticeship)\r\nin lectures from which the wider circle was excluded. Being entirely\r\ndevoted to theological and philosophical speculations on the nature\r\nof things, the Upanishads mark the last stage of development in\r\nthe Brahmana literature. As they generally come at the end of the\r\nBrahmanas, they are also called Vedanta (\"end of the Veda\"), a term\r\nlater interpreted to mean \"final goal of the Veda.\" \"Revelation\"\r\n(çruti) was regarded as including them, while the Sutras belonged to\r\nthe sphere of tradition (smriti). The subject-matter of all the old\r\nUpanishads is essentially the same--the doctrine of the nature of\r\nthe Atman or Brahma (the supreme soul). This fundamental theme was\r\nexpounded in various ways by the different Vedic schools, of which\r\nthe Upanishads were originally the dogmatic text-books, just as the\r\nBrahmanas were their ritual text-books.\r\n\r\nThe Aranyakas and Upanishads represent a phase of language which\r\non the whole closely approaches to classical Sanskrit, the oldest\r\nUpanishads occupying a position linguistically midway between the\r\nBrahmanas and the Sutras.\r\n\r\nOf the two Brahmanas attached to the Rigveda, the more important is the\r\nAitareya. The extant text consists of forty chapters (adhyaya) divided\r\ninto eight books called panchikas or \"pentads,\" because containing\r\nfive chapters each. That its last ten chapters were a later addition\r\nappears likely both from internal evidence and from the fact that the\r\nclosely related Çankhayana Brahmana contains nothing corresponding to\r\ntheir subject-matter, which is dealt with in the Çankhayana Sutra. The\r\nlast three books would further appear to have been composed at a\r\nlater date than the first five, since the perfect in the former\r\nis used as a narrative tense, while in the latter it still has its\r\noriginal present force, as in the oldest Brahmanas. The essential\r\npart of this Brahmana deals with the soma sacrifice. It treats first\r\n(1-16) of the soma rite called Agnishtoma, which lasts one day, then\r\n(17-18) of that called Gavamayana, which lasts 360 days, and thirdly\r\n(19-24) of the Dvadaçaha or \"twelve days' rite.\" The next part (25-32),\r\nwhich is concerned with the Agnihotra or \"fire sacrifice\" and other\r\nmatters, has the character of a supplement. The last portion (33-40),\r\ndealing with the ceremonies of the inauguration of the king and with\r\nthe position of his domestic priest, bears similar signs of lateness.\r\n\r\nThe other Brahmana of the Rigveda, which goes by the name of Kaushitaki\r\nas well as Çankhayana, consists of thirty chapters. Its subject-matter\r\nis, on the whole, the same as that of the original part of the Aitareya\r\n(i.-v.), but is wider. For in its opening chapters it goes through\r\nthe setting up of the sacred fire (agni-adhana), the daily morning\r\nand evening sacrifice (agnihotra), the new and full moon ritual, and\r\nthe four-monthly sacrifices. The Soma sacrifice, however, occupies the\r\nchief position even here. The more definite and methodical treatment\r\nof the ritual in the Kaushitaki would seem to indicate that this\r\nBrahmana was composed at a later date than the first five books of\r\nthe Aitareya. Such a conclusion is, however, not altogether borne out\r\nby a comparison of the linguistic data of these two works. Professor\r\nWeber argues from the occurrence in one passage of Içana and Mahadeva\r\nas designations of the god who was later exclusively called Çiva,\r\nthat the Kaushitaki Brahmana was composed at about the same time\r\nas the latest books of the White Yajurveda and those parts of the\r\nAtharva-veda and of the Çatapatha Brahmana in which these appellations\r\nof the same god are found.\r\n\r\nThese Brahmanas contain very few geographical data. From the way,\r\nhowever, in which the Aitareya mentions the Indian tribes, it may be\r\nsafely inferred that this work had its origin in the country of the\r\nKuru-Panchalas, in which, as we have seen, the Vedic ritual must have\r\nbeen developed, and the hymns of the Rigveda were probably collected\r\nin the existing Samhita. From the Kaushitaki we learn that the study\r\nof language was specially cultivated in the north of India, and that\r\nstudents who returned from there were regarded as authorities on\r\nlinguistic questions.\r\n\r\nThe chief human interest of these Brahmanas lies in the numerous myths\r\nand legends which they contain. The longest and most remarkable of\r\nthose found in the Aitareya is the story of Çunahçepa (Dog's-Tail),\r\nwhich forms the third chapter of Book VII. The childless King\r\nHariçchandra vowed, if he should have a son, to sacrifice him to\r\nVaruna. But when his son Rohita was born, he kept putting off the\r\nfulfilment of his promise. At length, when the boy was grown up, his\r\nfather, pressed by Varuna, prepared to perform the sacrifice. Rohita,\r\nhowever, escaped to the forest, where he wandered for six years,\r\nwhile his father was afflicted with dropsy by Varuna. At last he\r\nfell in with a starving Brahman, who consented to sell to him for a\r\nhundred cows his son Çunahçepa as a substitute. Varuna agreed, saying,\r\n\"A Brahman is worth more than a Kshatriya.\" Çunahçepa was accordingly\r\nbound to the stake, and the sacrifice was about to proceed, when the\r\nvictim prayed to various gods in succession. As he repeated one verse\r\nafter the other, the fetters of Varuna began to fall off and the\r\ndropsical swelling of the king to diminish, till finally Çunahçepa\r\nwas released and Hariçchandra was restored to health again.\r\n\r\nThe style of the prose in which the Aitareya is composed is crude,\r\nclumsy, abrupt, and elliptical. The following quotation from the\r\nstanzas interspersed in the story of Çunahçepa may serve as a specimen\r\nof the gathas found in the Brahmanas. These verses are addressed by\r\na sage named Narada to King Hariçchandra on the importance of having\r\na son:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    In him a father pays a debt\r\n    And reaches immortality,\r\n    When he beholds the countenance\r\n    Of a son born to him alive.\r\n\r\n    Than all the joy which living things\r\n    In waters feel, in earth and fire,\r\n    The happiness that in his son\r\n    A father feels is greater far.\r\n\r\n    At all times fathers by a son\r\n    Much darkness, too, have passed beyond:\r\n    In him the father's self is born,\r\n    He wafts him to the other shore.\r\n\r\n    Food is man's life and clothes afford protection,\r\n    Gold gives him beauty, marriages bring cattle;\r\n    His wife's a friend, his daughter causes pity:\r\n    A son is like a light in highest heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Aitareya Brahmana belongs the Aitareya Aranyaka. It consists\r\nof eighteen chapters, distributed unequally among five books. The\r\nlast two books are composed in the Sutra style, and are really to\r\nbe regarded as belonging to the Sutra literature. Four parts can\r\nbe clearly distinguished in the first three books. Book I. deals\r\nwith various liturgies of the Soma sacrifice from a purely ritual\r\npoint of view. The first three chapters of Book II., on the other\r\nhand, are theosophical in character, containing speculations about\r\nthe world-soul under the names of Prana and Purusha. It is allied in\r\nmatter to the Upanishads, some of its more valuable thoughts recurring,\r\noccasionally even word for word, in the Kaushitaki Upanishad. The\r\nthird part consists of the remaining four sections of Book II.,\r\nwhich form the regular Aitareya Upanishad. Finally, Book III. deals\r\nwith the mystic and allegorical meaning of the three principal modes\r\nin which the Veda is recited in the Samhita, Pada and Krama Pathas,\r\nand of the various letters of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nTo the Kaushitaki Brahmana is attached the Kaushitaki Aranyaka. It\r\nconsists of fifteen chapters. The first two of these correspond to\r\nBooks I. and V. of the Aitareya Aranyaka, the seventh and eighth\r\nto Book III., while the intervening four chapters (3-6) form the\r\nKaushitaki Upanishad. The latter is a long and very interesting\r\nUpanishad. It seems not improbably to have been added as an independent\r\ntreatise to the completed Aranyaka, as it is not always found in the\r\nsame part of the latter work in the manuscripts.\r\n\r\nBrahmanas belonging to two independent schools of the Samaveda\r\nhave been preserved, those of the Tandins and of the Talavakaras\r\nor Jaiminiyas. Though several other works here claim the title of\r\nritual text-books, only three are in reality Brahmanas. The Brahmana\r\nof the Talavakaras, which for the most part is still unpublished,\r\nseems to consist of five books. The first three (unpublished) are\r\nmainly concerned with various parts of the sacrificial ceremonial. The\r\nfourth book, called the Upanishad Brahmana (probably \"the Brahmana of\r\nmystic meanings\"), besides all kinds of allegories of the Aranyaka\r\norder, two lists of teachers, a section about the origin of the\r\nvital airs (prana) and about the savitri stanza, contains the brief\r\nbut important Kena Upanishad. Book V., entitled Arsheya-Brahmana,\r\nis a short enumeration of the composers of the Samaveda.\r\n\r\nTo the school of the Tandins belongs the Panchavimça (\"twenty-five\r\nfold\"), also called Tandya or Praudha, Brahmana, which, as the first\r\nname implies, consists of twenty-five books. It is concerned with\r\nthe Soma sacrifices in general, ranging from the minor offerings to\r\nthose which lasted a hundred days, or even several years. Besides\r\nmany legends, it contains a minute description of sacrifices performed\r\non the Sarasvati and Drishadvati. Though Kurukshetra is known to it,\r\nother geographical data which it contains point to the home of this\r\nBrahmana having lain farther east. Noteworthy among its contents are\r\nthe so-called Vratya-Stomas, which are sacrifices meant to enable\r\nAryan but non-Brahmanical Indians to enter the Brahmanical order. A\r\npoint of interest in this Brahmana is the bitter hostility which\r\nit displays towards the school of the Kaushitakins. The Shadvimça\r\nBrahmana, though nominally an independent work, is in reality a\r\nsupplement to the Panchavimça, of which, as its name implies, it\r\nforms the twenty-sixth book. The last of its six chapters is called\r\nthe Adbhuta Brahmana, which is intended to obviate the evil effects\r\nof various extraordinary events or portents. Among such phenomena\r\nare mentioned images of the gods when they laugh, cry, sing, dance,\r\nperspire, crack, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe other Brahmana of this school, the Chhandogya Brahmana, is only\r\nto a slight extent a ritual text-book. It does not deal with the\r\nSoma sacrifice at all, but only with ceremonies relating to birth\r\nand marriage or prayers addressed to divine beings. These are the\r\ncontents of only the first two \"lessons\" of this Brahmana of the Sama\r\ntheologians. The remaining eight lessons constitute the Chhandogya\r\nUpanishad.\r\n\r\nThere are four other short works which, though bearing the name, are\r\nnot really Brahmanas. These are the Samavidhana Brahmana, a treatise on\r\nthe employment of chants for all kinds of superstitious purposes; the\r\nDevatadhyaya Brahmana, containing some statements about the deities\r\nof the various chants of the Samaveda; the Vamça Brahmana, which\r\nfurnishes a genealogy of the teachers of the Samaveda; and, finally,\r\nthe Samhitopanishad, which, like the third book of the Aitareya\r\nAranyaka, treats of the way in which the Veda should be recited.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmanas of the Samaveda are distinguished by the exaggerated and\r\nfantastic character of their mystical speculations. A prominent feature\r\nin them is the constant identification of various kinds of Samans\r\nor chants with all kinds of terrestrial and celestial objects. At\r\nthe same time they contain much matter that is interesting from a\r\nhistorical point of view.\r\n\r\nIn the Black Yajurveda the prose portions of the various Samhitas form\r\nthe only Brahmanas in the Katha and the Maitrayaniya schools. In\r\nthe Taittiriya school they form the oldest and most important\r\nBrahmana. Here we have also the Taittiriya Brahmana as an independent\r\nwork in three books. This, however, hardly differs in character\r\nfrom the Taittiriya Samhita, being rather a continuation. It forms a\r\nsupplement concerned with a few sacrifices omitted in the Samhita,\r\nor handles, with greater fulness of detail, matters already dealt\r\nwith. There is also a Taittiriya Aranyaka, which in its turn forms\r\na supplement to the Brahmana. The last four of its ten sections\r\nconstitute the two Upanishads of this school, vii.-ix. forming the\r\nTaittiriya Upanishad, and x. the Maha-Narayana Upanishad, also called\r\nthe Yajniki Upanishad. Excepting these four sections, the title of\r\nBrahmana or Aranyaka does not indicate a difference of content as\r\ncompared with the Samhita, but is due to late and artificial imitation\r\nof the other Vedas.\r\n\r\nThe last three sections of Book III. of the Brahmana, as well as the\r\nfirst two books of the Aranyaka, originally belonged to the school\r\nof the Kathas, though they have not been preserved as part of the\r\ntradition of that school. The different origin of these parts is\r\nindicated by the absence of the change of y and v to iy and uv\r\nrespectively, which otherwise prevails in the Taittiriya Brahmana\r\nand Aranyaka. In one of these Kathaka sections (Taitt. Br. iii. 11),\r\nby way of illustrating the significance of the particular fire called\r\nnachiketa, the story is told of a boy, Nachiketas, who, on visiting\r\nthe House of Death, was granted the fulfilment of three wishes by\r\nthe god of the dead. On this story is based the Kathaka Upanishad.\r\n\r\nThough the Maitrayani Samhita has no independent Brahmana, its fourth\r\nbook, as consisting of explanations and supplements to the first\r\nthree, is a kind of special Brahmana. Connected with this Samhita,\r\nand in the manuscripts sometimes forming its second or its fifth book,\r\nis the Maitrayana (also called Maitrayaniya and Maitri) Upanishad.\r\n\r\nThe ritual explanation of the White Yajurveda is to be found in\r\nextraordinary fulness in the Çatapatha Brahmana., the \"Brahmana of the\r\nHundred Paths,\" so called because it consists of one hundred lectures\r\n(adhyaya). This work is, next to the Rigveda, the most important\r\nproduction in the whole range of Vedic literature. Its text has come\r\ndown in two recensions, those of the Madhyamdina school, edited by\r\nProfessor Weber, and of the Kanva school, which is in process of being\r\nedited by Professor Eggeling. The Madhyamdina recension consists of\r\nfourteen books, while the Kanva has seventeen. The first nine of the\r\nformer, corresponding to the original eighteen books of the Vajasaneyi\r\nSamhita, doubtless form the oldest part. The fact that Book XII. is\r\ncalled madhyama, or \"middle one,\" shows that the last five books\r\n(or possibly only X.-XIII.) were at one time regarded as a separate\r\npart of the Brahmana. Book X. treats of the mystery of the fire-altar\r\n(agnirahasya), XI. is a sort of recapitulation of the preceding ritual,\r\nwhile XII. and XIII. deal with various supplementary matters. The\r\nlast book forms the Aranyaka, the six concluding chapters of which\r\nare the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.\r\n\r\nBooks VI.-X. of the Çatapatha Brahmana occupy a peculiar\r\nposition. Treating of the construction of the fire-altar, they\r\nrecognise the teaching of Çandilya as their highest authority,\r\nYajnavalkya not even being mentioned; while the peoples who are\r\nnamed, the Gandharas, Salvas, Kekayas, belong to the north-west. In\r\nthe other books Yajnavalkya is the highest authority, while hardly\r\nany but Eastern peoples, or those of the middle of Hindustan, the\r\nKuru-Panchalas, Kosalas, Videhas, Srinjayas, are named. That the\r\noriginal authorship of the five Çandilya books was different from that\r\nof the others is indicated by a number of linguistic differences,\r\nwhich the hand of a later editor failed to remove. Thus the use of\r\nthe perfect as a narrative tense is unknown to the Çandilya books\r\n(as well as to XIII.).\r\n\r\nThe geographical data of the Çatapatha Brahmana point to the\r\nland of the Kuru-Panchalas being still the centre of Brahmanical\r\nculture. Janamejaya is here celebrated as a king of the Kurus, and\r\nthe most renowned Brahmanical teacher of the age, Aruni, is expressly\r\nstated to have been a Panchala. Nevertheless, it is clear that the\r\nBrahmanical system had by this time spread to the countries to the\r\neast of Madhyadeça, to Kosala, with its capital, Ayodhya (Oudh), and\r\nVideha (Tirhut or Northern Behar), with its capital, Mithila. The\r\ncourt of King Janaka of Videha was thronged with Brahmans from the\r\nKuru-Panchala country. The tournaments of argument which were here\r\nheld form a prominent feature in the later books of the Çatapatha\r\nBrahmana. The hero of these is Yajnavalkya, who, himself a pupil of\r\nAruni, is regarded as the chief spiritual authority in the Brahmana\r\n(excepting Books VI.-X.). Certain passages of the Brahmana render\r\nit highly probable that Yajnavalkya was a native of Videha. The fact\r\nthat its leading authority, who thus appears to have belonged to this\r\nEastern country, is represented as vanquishing the most distinguished\r\nteachers of the West in argument, points to the redaction of the\r\nWhite Yajurveda having taken place in this eastern region.\r\n\r\nThe Çatapatha Brahmana contains reminiscences of the days when the\r\ncountry of Videha was not as yet Brahmanised. Thus Book I. relates\r\na legend in which three stages in the eastward migration of the\r\nAryans can be clearly distinguished. Mathava, the king of Videgha\r\n(the older form of Videha), whose family priest was Gotama Rahugana,\r\nwas at one time on the Sarasvati. Agni Vaiçvanara (here typical of\r\nBrahmanical culture) thence went burning along this earth towards the\r\neast, followed by Mathava and his priest, till he came to the river\r\nSadanira (probably the modern Gandak, a tributary running into the\r\nGanges near Patna), which flows from the northern mountain, and which\r\nhe did not burn over. This river Brahmans did not cross in former\r\ntimes, thinking \"it has not been burnt over by Agni Vaiçvanara.\" At\r\nthat time the land to the eastward was very uncultivated and marshy,\r\nbut now many Brahmans are there, and it is highly cultivated, for the\r\nBrahmans have caused Agni to taste it through sacrifices. Mathava the\r\nVidegha then said to Agni, \"Where am I to abide?\" \"To the east of this\r\nriver be thy abode,\" he replied. Even now, the writer adds, this river\r\nforms the boundary between the Kosalas (Oudh) and the Videhas (Tirhut).\r\n\r\nThe Vajasaneyi school of the White Yajurveda evidently felt a sense\r\nof the superiority of their sacrificial lore, which grew up in these\r\neastern countries. Blame is frequently expressed in the Çatapatha\r\nBrahmana of the Adhvaryu priests of the Charaka school. The latter is\r\nmeant as a comprehensive term embracing the three older schools of the\r\nBlack Yajurveda, the Kathas, the Kapishthalas, and the Maitrayaniyas.\r\n\r\nAs Buddhism first obtained a firm footing in Kosala and Videha, it is\r\ninteresting to inquire in what relation the Çatapatha Brahmana stands\r\nto the beginnings of that doctrine. In this connection it is to be\r\nnoted that the words Arhat, Çramana, and Pratibuddha occur here for\r\nthe first time, but as yet without the technical sense which they have\r\nin Buddhistic literature. Again, in the lists of teachers given in\r\nthe Brahmana mention is made with special frequency of the Gautamas,\r\na family name used by the Çakyas of Kapilavastu, among whom Buddha\r\nwas born. Certain allusions are also suggestive of the beginnings of\r\nthe Sankhya doctrine; for mention is several times made of a teacher\r\ncalled Asuri, and according to tradition Asuri is the name of a leading\r\nauthority for the Sankhya system. If we inquire as to how far the\r\nlegends of our Brahmana contain the germs of the later epic tales,\r\nwe find that there is indeed some slight connection. Janamejaya,\r\nthe celebrated king of the Kurus in the Mahabharata, is mentioned\r\nhere for the first time. The Pandus, however, who proved victorious\r\nin the epic war, are not to be met with in this any more than in the\r\nother Brahmanas; and Arjuna, the name of their chief, is still an\r\nappellation of Indra. But as the epic Arjuna is a son of Indra, his\r\norigin is doubtless to be traced to this epithet of Indra. Janaka,\r\nthe famous king of Videha, is in all probability identical with the\r\nfather of Sita, the heroine of the Ramayana.\r\n\r\nOf two legends which furnished the classical poet Kalidasa with the\r\nplots of two of his most famous dramas, one is told in detail, and the\r\nother is at least alluded to. The story of the love and separation\r\nof Pururavas and Urvaçi, already dimly shadowed forth in a hymn of\r\nthe Rigveda, is here related with much more fulness; while Bharata,\r\nson of Duhshanta and of the nymph Çakuntala, also appears on the\r\nscene in this Brahmana.\r\n\r\nA most interesting legend which reappears in the Mahabharata, that\r\nof the Deluge, is here told for the first time in Indian literature,\r\nthough it seems to be alluded to in the Atharva-veda, while it is\r\nknown even to the Avesta. This myth is generally regarded as derived\r\nfrom a Semitic source. It tells how Manu once came into possession of\r\na small fish, which asked him to rear it, and promised to save him\r\nfrom the coming flood. Having built a ship in accordance with the\r\nfish's advice, he entered it when the deluge arose, and was finally\r\nguided to the Northern Mountain by the fish, to whose horn he had\r\ntied his ship. Manu subsequently became the progenitor of mankind\r\nthrough his daughter.\r\n\r\nThe Çatapatha Brahmana is thus a mine of important data and noteworthy\r\nnarratives. Internal evidence shows it to belong to a late period\r\nof the Brahmana age. Its style, as compared with the earlier works\r\nof the same class, displays some progress towards facility and\r\nclearness. Its treatment of the sacrificial ceremonial, which is\r\nessentially the same in the Brahmana portions of the Black Yajurveda,\r\nis throughout more lucid and systematic. On the theosophic side, too,\r\nwe find the idea of the unity in the universe more fully developed\r\nthan in any other Brahmana work, while its Upanishad is the finest\r\nproduct of Vedic philosophy.\r\n\r\nTo the Atharva-veda is attached the Gopatha Brahmana, though it has\r\nno particular connection with that Samhita. This Brahmana consists of\r\ntwo books, the first containing five chapters, the second six. Both\r\nparts are very late, for they were composed after the Vaitana Sutra and\r\npractically without any Atharvan tradition. The matter of the former\r\nhalf, while not corresponding or following the order of the sacrifice\r\nin any ritual text, is to a considerable extent original, the rest\r\nbeing borrowed from Books XI. and XII. of the Çatapatha Brahmana,\r\nbesides a few passages from the Aitareya. The main motive of this\r\nportion is the glorification of the Atharva-veda and of the fourth or\r\nbrahman priest. The mention of the god Çiva points to its belonging to\r\nthe post-Vedic rather than to the Brahmana period. Its presupposing the\r\nAtharva-veda in twenty books, and containing grammatical matters of a\r\nvery advanced type, are other signs of lateness. The latter half bears\r\nmore the stamp of a regular Brahmana, being a fairly connected account\r\nof the ritual in the sacrificial order of the Vaitana Çrauta Sutra;\r\nbut it is for the most part a compilation. The ordinary historical\r\nrelation of Brahmana and Sutra is here reversed, the second book of\r\nthe Gopatha Brahmana being based on the Vaitana Sutra, which stands\r\nto it practically in the relation of a Samhita. About two-thirds of\r\nits matter have already been shown to be taken from older texts. The\r\nAitareya and Kaushitaki Brahmanas have been chiefly exploited, and to\r\na less extent the Maitrayani and Taittiriya Samhitas. A few passages\r\nare derived from the Çatapatha, and even the Panchavimça Brahmana.\r\n\r\nThough the Upanishads generally form a part of the Brahmanas, being\r\na continuation of their speculative side (jnana-kanda), they really\r\nrepresent a new religion, which is in virtual opposition to the\r\nritual or practical side (karma-kanda). Their aim is no longer the\r\nobtainment of earthly happiness and afterwards bliss in the abode of\r\nYama by sacrificing correctly to the gods, but release from mundane\r\nexistence by the absorption of the individual soul in the world-soul\r\nthrough correct knowledge. Here, therefore, the sacrificial ceremonial\r\nhas become useless and speculative knowledge all-important.\r\n\r\nThe essential theme of the Upanishads is the nature of the\r\nworld-soul. Their conception of it represents the final stage in\r\nthe development from the world-man, Purusha, of the Rigveda to\r\nthe world-soul, Atman; from the personal creator, Prajapati, to\r\nthe impersonal source of all being, Brahma. Atman in the Rigveda\r\nmeans no more than \"breath\"; wind, for instance, being spoken of\r\nas the atman of Varuna. In the Brahmanas it came to mean \"soul\" or\r\n\"self.\" In one of their speculations the pranas or \"vital airs,\"\r\nwhich are supposed to be based on the atman, are identified with the\r\ngods, and so an atman comes to be attributed to the universe. In one\r\nof the later books of the Çatapatha Brahmana (X. vi. 3) this atman,\r\nwhich has already arrived at a high degree of abstraction, is said to\r\n\"pervade this universe.\" Brahma (neuter) in the Rigveda signified\r\nnothing more than \"prayer\" or \"devotion.\" But even in the oldest\r\nBrahmanas it has come to have the sense of \"universal holiness,\"\r\nas manifested in prayer, priest, and sacrifice. In the Upanishads\r\nit is the holy principle which animates nature. Having a long\r\nsubsequent history, this word is a very epitome of the evolution of\r\nreligious thought in India. These two conceptions, Atman and Brahma,\r\nare commonly treated as synonymous in the Upanishads. But, strictly\r\nspeaking, Brahma, the older term, represents the cosmical principle\r\nwhich pervades the universe, Atman the psychical principle manifested\r\nin man; and the latter, as the known, is used to explain the former\r\nas the unknown. The Atman under the name of the Eternal (aksharam)\r\nis thus described in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (III. viii. 8, 11):--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"It is not large, and not minute; not short, not long; without\r\n    blood, without fat; without shadow, without darkness; without wind,\r\n    without ether; not adhesive, not tangible; without smell, without\r\n    taste; without eyes, ears, voice, or mind; without heat, breath, or\r\n    mouth; without personal or family name; unaging, undying, without\r\n    fear, immortal, dustless, not uncovered or covered; with nothing\r\n    before, nothing behind, nothing within. It consumes no one and\r\n    is consumed by no one. It is the unseen seer, the unheard hearer,\r\n    the unthought thinker, the unknown knower. There is no other seer,\r\n    no other hearer, no other thinker, no other knower. That is the\r\n    Eternal in which space (akaça) is woven and which is interwoven\r\n    with it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, for the first time in the history of human thought, we find\r\nthe Absolute grasped and proclaimed.\r\n\r\nA poetical account of the nature of the Atman is given by the Kathaka\r\nUpanishad in the following stanzas:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    That whence the sun's orb rises up,\r\n    And that in which it sinks again:\r\n    In it the gods are all contained,\r\n    Beyond it none can ever pass (iv. 9).\r\n\r\n    Its form can never be to sight apparent,\r\n    Not any one may with his eye behold it:\r\n    By heart and mind and soul alone they grasp it,\r\n    And those who know it thus become immortal (vi. 9).\r\n\r\n    Since not by speech and not by thought,\r\n    Not by the eye can it be reached:\r\n    How else may it be understood\r\n    But only when one says \"it is\"? (vi. 12).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place of the more personal Prajapati is taken in the Upanishads by\r\nthe Atman as a creative power. Thus the Brihadaranyaka (I. iv.) relates\r\nthat in the beginning the Atman or the Brahma was this universe. It\r\nwas afraid in its loneliness and felt no pleasure. Desiring a second\r\nbeing, it became man and woman, whence the human race was produced. It\r\nthen proceeded to produce male and female animals in a similar way;\r\nfinally creating water, fire, the gods, and so forth. The author then\r\nproceeds in a more exalted strain:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"It (the Atman) is here all-pervading down to the tips of the\r\n    nails. One does not see it any more than a razor hidden in its case\r\n    or fire in its receptacle. For it does not appear as a whole. When\r\n    it breathes, it is called breath; when it speaks, voice; when it\r\n    hears, ear; when it thinks, mind. These are merely the names of\r\n    its activities. He who worships the one or the other of these,\r\n    has not (correct) knowledge.... One should worship it as the\r\n    Self. For in it all these (breath, etc.) become one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of the later Upanishads, the Çvetaçvatara (iv. 10), the notion,\r\nso prominent in the later Vedanta system, that the material world is\r\nan illusion (maya), is first met with. The world is here explained\r\nas an illusion produced by Brahma as a conjuror (mayin). This notion\r\nis, however, inherent even in the oldest Upanishads. It is virtually\r\nidentical with the teaching of Plato that the things of experience\r\nare only the shadow of the real things, and with the teaching of Kant,\r\nthat they are only phenomena of the thing in itself.\r\n\r\nThe great fundamental doctrine of the Upanishads is the identity of the\r\nindividual atman with the world Atman. It is most forcibly expressed in\r\na frequently repeated sentence of the Chhandogya Upanishad (vi. 8-16):\r\n\"This whole world consists of it: that is the Real, that is the Soul,\r\nthat art thou, O Çvetaketu.\" In that famous formula, \"That art thou\"\r\n(tat tvam asi), all the teachings of the Upanishads are summed\r\nup. The Brihadaranyaka (I. iv. 6) expresses the same doctrine thus:\r\n\"Whoever knows this, 'I am brahma' (aham brahma asmi), becomes the\r\nAll. Even the gods are not able to prevent him from becoming it. For\r\nhe becomes their Self (atman).\"\r\n\r\nThis identity was already recognised in the Çatapatha Brahmana\r\n(X. vi. 3): \"Even as the smallest granule of millet, so is this\r\ngolden Purusha in the heart.... That self of the spirit is my self:\r\non passing from hence I shall obtain that Self.\"\r\n\r\nWe find everywhere in these treatises a restless striving to grasp\r\nthe true nature of the pantheistic Self, now through one metaphor,\r\nnow through another. Thus (Brih. Up. II. iv.) the wise Yajnavalkya,\r\nabout to renounce the world and retire to the forest, replies to the\r\nquestion of his wife, Maitreyi, with the words: \"As a lump of salt\r\nthrown into the water would dissolve and could not be taken out again,\r\nwhile the water, wherever tasted, would be salt, so is this great\r\nbeing endless, unlimited, simply compacted of cognition. Arising\r\nout of these elements, it disappears again in them. After death\r\nthere is no consciousness;\" for, as he further explains, when the\r\nduality on which consciousness is based disappears, consciousness\r\nmust necessarily cease.\r\n\r\nIn another passage of the same Upanishad (II. i. 20) we read: \"Just\r\nas the spider goes out of itself by means of its thread, as tiny\r\nsparks leap out of the fire, so from the Atman issue all vital airs,\r\nall worlds, all gods, all beings.\"\r\n\r\nHere, again, is a stanza from the Mundaka (III. ii. 8):--\r\n\r\n\r\n    As rivers flow and disappear at last\r\n    In ocean's waters, name and form renouncing,\r\n    So, too, the sage, released from name and form,\r\n    Is merged in the divine and highest spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a passage of the Brihadaranyaka (III. vii.) Yajnavalkya describes\r\nthe Atman as the \"inner guide\" (antaryamin): \"Who is in all beings,\r\ndifferent from all beings, who guides all beings within, that is thy\r\nSelf, the inward guide, immortal.\"\r\n\r\nThe same Upanishad contains an interesting conversation, in which King\r\nAjataçatru of Kaçi (Benares) instructs the Brahman, Balaki Gargya,\r\nthat Brahma is not the spirit (purusha) which is in sun, moon, wind,\r\nand other natural phenomena, or even in the (waking) soul (atman),\r\nbut is either the dreaming soul, which is creative, assuming any form\r\nat pleasure, or, in the highest stage, the soul in dreamless sleep,\r\nfor here all phenomena have disappeared. This is the first and the\r\nlast condition of Brahma, in which no world exists, all material\r\nexistence being only the phantasms of the dreaming world-soul.\r\n\r\nOf somewhat similar purport is a passage of the Chhandogya\r\n(viii. 7-12), where Prajapati is represented as teaching the nature\r\nof the Atman in three stages. The soul in the body as reflected in\r\na mirror or water is first identified with Brahma, then the dreaming\r\nsoul, and, lastly, the soul in dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\nHow generally accepted the pantheistic theory must have become by\r\nthe time the disputations at the court of King Janaka took place, is\r\nindicated by the form in which questions are put. Thus two different\r\nsages in the Brihadaranyaka (iii. 4, 5) successively ask Yajnavalkya\r\nin the same words: \"Explain to us the Brahma which is manifest and\r\nnot hidden, the Atman that dwells in everything.\"\r\n\r\nWith the doctrine that true knowledge led to supreme bliss by the\r\nabsorption of the individual soul in Brahma went hand in hand the\r\ntheory of transmigration (samsara). That theory is developed in\r\nthe oldest Upanishads; it must have been firmly established by the\r\ntime Buddhism arose, for Buddha accepted it without question. Its\r\nearliest form is found in the Çatapatha Brahmana, where the notion\r\nof being born again after death and dying repeatedly is coupled with\r\nthat of retribution. Thus it is here said that those who have correct\r\nknowledge and perform a certain sacrifice are born again after death\r\nfor immortality, while those who have not such knowledge and do not\r\nperform this sacrifice are reborn again and again, becoming the prey\r\nof Death. The notion here expressed does not go beyond repeated births\r\nand deaths in the next world. It is transformed to the doctrine of\r\ntransmigration in the Upanishads by supposing rebirth to take place in\r\nthis world. In the Brihadaranyaka we further meet with the beginnings\r\nof the doctrine of karma, or \"action,\" which regulates the new birth,\r\nand makes it depend on a man's own deeds. When the body returns to\r\nthe elements, nothing of the individuality is here said to remain\r\nbut the karma, according to which a man becomes good or bad. This is,\r\nperhaps, the germ of the Buddhistic doctrine, which, though denying\r\nthe existence of soul altogether, allows karma to continue after\r\ndeath and to determine the next birth.\r\n\r\nThe most important and detailed account of the theory of transmigration\r\nwhich we possess from Vedic times is supplied by the Chhandogya\r\nUpanishad. The forest ascetic possessed of knowledge and faith, it is\r\nhere said, after death enters the devayana, the \"path of the gods,\"\r\nwhich leads to absorption in Brahma, while the householder who has\r\nperformed sacrifice and good works goes by the pitriyana or \"path of\r\nthe Fathers\" to the moon, where he remains till the consequences of\r\nhis actions are exhausted. He then returns to earth, being first born\r\nagain as a plant and afterwards as a man of one of the three highest\r\ncastes. Here we have a double retribution, first in the next world,\r\nthen by transmigration in this. The former is a survival of the old\r\nVedic belief about the future life. The wicked are born again as\r\noutcasts (chandalas), dogs or swine.\r\n\r\nThe account of the Brihadaranyaka (VI. ii. 15-16) is similar. Those\r\nwho have true knowledge and faith pass through the world of the gods\r\nand the sun to the world of Brahma, whence there is no return. Those\r\nwho practise sacrifice and good works pass through the world of the\r\nFathers to the moon, whence they return to earth, being born again\r\nas men. Others become birds, beasts, and reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe view of the Kaushitaki Upanishad (i. 2-3) is somewhat\r\ndifferent. Here all who die go to the moon, whence some go by the\r\n\"path of the Fathers\" to Brahma, while others return to various\r\nforms of earthly existence, ranging from man to worm, according to\r\nthe quality of their works and the degree of their knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Kathaka, one of the most remarkable and beautiful of the\r\nUpanishads, treats the question of life after death in the form of a\r\nlegend. Nachiketas, a young Brahman, visits the realm of Yama, who\r\noffers him the choice of three boons. For the third he chooses the\r\nanswer to the question, whether man exists after death or no. Death\r\nreplies: \"Even the gods have doubted about this; it is a subtle point;\r\nchoose another boon.\" After vain efforts to evade the question by\r\noffering Nachiketas earthly power and riches, Yama at last yields to\r\nhis persistence and reveals the secret. Life and death, he explains,\r\nare only different phases of development. True knowledge, which\r\nconsists in recognising the identity of the individual soul with the\r\nworld soul, raises its possessor beyond the reach of death:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    When every passion vanishes\r\n    That nestles in the human heart,\r\n    Then man gains immortality,\r\n    Then Brahma is obtained by him (vi. 14).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the temptation of Nachiketas to choose the goods of this\r\nworld in preference to the highest knowledge is probably the prototype\r\nof the legend of the temptation of Buddha by Mara or Death. Both by\r\nresisting the temptation obtain enlightenment.\r\n\r\nIt must not of course be supposed that the Upanishads, either as a\r\nwhole or individually, offer a complete and consistent conception\r\nof the world logically developed. They are rather a mixture\r\nof half-poetical, half-philosophical fancies, of dialogues and\r\ndisputations dealing tentatively with metaphysical questions. Their\r\nspeculations were only later reduced to a system in the Vedanta\r\nphilosophy. The earliest of them can hardly be dated later than about\r\n600 B.C., since some important doctrines first met with in them are\r\npresupposed by Buddhism. They may be divided chronologically, on\r\ninternal evidence, into four classes. The oldest group, consisting,\r\nin chronological order, of the Brihadaranyaka, Chhandogya, Taittiriya,\r\nAitareya, Kaushitaki, is written in prose which still suffers from the\r\nawkwardness of the Brahmana style. A transition is formed by the Kena,\r\nwhich is partly in verse and partly in prose, to a decidedly later\r\nclass, the Kathaka, Iça, Çvetaçvatara, Mundaka, Mahanarayana, which are\r\nmetrical, and in which the Upanishad doctrine is no longer developing,\r\nbut has become fixed. These are more attractive from the literary\r\npoint of view. Even those of the older class acquire a peculiar\r\ncharm from their liveliness, enthusiasm, and freedom from pedantry,\r\nwhile their language often rises to the level of eloquence. The third\r\nclass, comprising the Praçna, Maitrayaniya, and Mandukya, reverts to\r\nthe use of prose, which is, however, of a much less archaic type than\r\nthat of the first class, and approaches that of classical Sanskrit\r\nwriters. The fourth class consists of the later Atharvan Upanishads,\r\nsome of which are composed in prose, others in verse.\r\n\r\nThe Aitareya, one of the shortest of the Upanishads (extending to\r\nonly about four octavo pages), consists of three chapters. The first\r\nrepresents the world as a creation of the Atman (also called Brahma),\r\nand man as its highest manifestation. It is based on the Purusha hymn\r\nof the Rigveda, but the primeval man is in the Upanishad described as\r\nhaving been produced by the Atman from the waters which it created. The\r\nAtman is here said to occupy three abodes in man, the senses, mind,\r\nand heart, to which respectively correspond the three conditions of\r\nwaking, dreaming, and deep sleep. The second chapter treats of the\r\nthreefold birth of the Atman. The end of transmigration is salvation,\r\nwhich is represented as an immortal existence in heaven. The last\r\nchapter dealing with the nature of the Atman states that \"consciousness\r\n(prajna) is Brahma.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kaushitaki Upanishad is a treatise of considerable length divided\r\ninto four chapters. The first deals with the two paths traversed by\r\nsouls after death in connection with transmigration; the second with\r\nPrana or life as a symbol of the Atman. The last two, while discussing\r\nthe doctrine of Brahma, contain a disquisition about the dependence\r\nof the objects of sense on the organs of sense, and of the latter on\r\nunconscious life (prana) and conscious life (prajnatma). Those who\r\naim at redeeming knowledge are therefore admonished not to seek after\r\nobjects or subjective faculties, but only the subject of cognition\r\nand action, which is described with much power as the highest god,\r\nand at the same time as the Atman within us.\r\n\r\nThe Upanishads of the Samaveda start from the saman or chant, just\r\nas those of the Rigveda from the uktha or hymn recited by the Hotri\r\npriest, in order, by interpreting it allegorically, to arrive at a\r\nknowledge of the Atman or Brahma. The fact that the Upanishads have the\r\nsame basis, which is, moreover, largely treated in a similar manner,\r\nleads to the conclusion that the various Vedic schools found a common\r\nbody of oral tradition which they shaped into dogmatic texts-books\r\nor Upanishads in their own way.\r\n\r\nThus the Chhandogya, which is equal in importance, and only slightly\r\ninferior in extent, to the Brihadaranyaka, bears clear traces,\r\nlike the latter, of being made up of collections of floating\r\nmaterials. Each of its eight chapters forms an independent whole,\r\nfollowed by supplementary pieces often but slightly connected with\r\nthe main subject-matter.\r\n\r\nThe first two chapters consist of mystical interpretations of the\r\nsaman and its chief part, called Udgitha (\"loud song\"). A supplement\r\nto the second chapter treats, among other subjects, of the origin of\r\nthe syllable om, and of the three stages of religious life, those of\r\nthe Brahman pupil, the householder, and the ascetic (to which later\r\nthe religious mendicant was added as a fourth). The third chapter in\r\nthe main deals with Brahma as the sun of the universe, the natural sun\r\nbeing its manifestation. The infinite Brahma is further described as\r\ndwelling, whole and undivided, in the heart of man. The way in which\r\nBrahma is to be attained is then described, and the great fundamental\r\ndogma of the identity of Brahma with the Atman (or, as we might say,\r\nof God and Soul) is declared. The chapter concludes with a myth\r\nwhich forms a connecting link between the cosmogonic conceptions of\r\nthe Rigveda and those of the law-book of Manu. The fourth chapter,\r\ncontaining discussions about wind, breath, and other phenomena\r\nconnected with Brahma, also teaches how the soul makes its way to\r\nBrahma after death.\r\n\r\nThe first half of chapter v. is almost identical with the beginning of\r\nchapter vi. of the Brihadaranyaka. It is chiefly noteworthy for the\r\ntheory of transmigration which it contains. The second half of the\r\nchapter is important as the earliest statement of the doctrine that\r\nthe manifold world is unreal. The sat by desire produced from itself\r\nthe three primary elements, heat, water, food (the later number being\r\nfive--ether, air, fire, water, earth). As individual soul (jiva-atman)\r\nit entered into these, which, by certain partial combinations called\r\n\"triplication,\" became various products (vikara) or phenomena. But\r\nthe latter are a mere name. Sat is the only reality, it is the Atman:\r\n\"Thou art that.\" Chapter vii. enumerates sixteen forms in which Brahma\r\nmay be adored, rising by gradation from naman, \"name,\" to bhuman,\r\n\"infinity,\" which is the all-in-all and the Atman within us. The first\r\nhalf of the last chapter discusses the Atman in the heart and the\r\nuniverse, as well as how to attain it. The concluding portion of the\r\nchapter distinguishes the false from the true Atman, illustrated by the\r\nthree stages in which it appears--in the material body, in dreaming,\r\nand in sound sleep. In the latter stage we have the true Atman,\r\nin which the distinction between subject and object has disappeared.\r\n\r\nTo the Samaveda also belongs a very short treatise which was long\r\ncalled the Talavakara Upanishad, from the school to which it was\r\nattached, but later, when it became separated from that school,\r\nreceived the name of Kena, from its initial word. It consists of two\r\ndistinct parts. The second, composed in prose and much older, describes\r\nthe relation of the Vedic gods to Brahma, representing them as deriving\r\ntheir power from and entirely dependent on the latter. The first part,\r\nwhich is metrical and belongs to the period of fully developed Vedanta\r\ndoctrine, distinguishes from the qualified Brahma, which is an object\r\nof worship, the unqualified Brahma, which is unknowable:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    To it no eye can penetrate,\r\n    Nor speech nor thought can ever reach:\r\n    It rests unknown; we cannot see\r\n    How any one may teach it us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various Upanishads of the Black Yajurveda all bear the stamp\r\nof lateness. The Maitrayana is a prose work of considerable extent,\r\nin which occasional stanzas are interspersed. It consists of seven\r\nchapters, the seventh and the concluding eight sections of the sixth\r\nforming a supplement. The fact that it retains the orthographical and\r\neuphonic peculiarities of the Maitrayana school, gives this Upanishad\r\nan archaic appearance. But its many quotations from other Upanishads,\r\nthe occurrence of several late words, the developed Sankhya doctrine\r\npresupposed by it, distinct references to anti-Vedic heretical schools,\r\nall combine to render the late character of this work undoubted. It is,\r\nin fact, a summing up of the old Upanishad doctrines with an admixture\r\nof ideas derived from the Sankhya system and from Buddhism. The main\r\nbody of the treatise expounds the nature of the Atman, communicated\r\nto King Brihadratha of the race of Ikshvaku (probably identical with\r\nthe king of that name mentioned in the Ramayana), who declaims at some\r\nlength on the misery and transitoriness of earthly existence. Though\r\npessimism is not unknown to the old Upanishads, it is much more\r\npronounced here, doubtless in consequence of Sankhya and Buddhistic\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe subject is treated in the form of three questions. The answer\r\nto the first, how the Atman enters the body, is that Prajapati\r\nenters in the form of the five vital airs in order to animate the\r\nlifeless bodies created by him. The second question is, How does\r\nthe supreme soul become the individual soul (bhutatman)? This is\r\nanswered rather in accordance with the Sankhya than the Vedanta\r\ndoctrine. Overcome by the three qualities of matter (prakriti),\r\nthe Atman, forgetting its real nature, becomes involved in\r\nself-consciousness and transmigration. The third question is, How\r\nis deliverance from this state of misery possible? This is answered\r\nin conformity with neither Vedanta nor Sankhya doctrine, but in a\r\nreactionary spirit. Only those who observe the old requirements of\r\nBrahmanism, the rules of caste and the religious orders (açramas),\r\nare declared capable of attaining salvation by knowledge, penance,\r\nand meditation on Brahma. The chief gods, that is to say, the triad of\r\nthe Brahmana period, Fire, Wind, Sun, the three abstractions, Time,\r\nBreath, Food, and the three popular gods, Brahma, Rudra (i.e. Çiva),\r\nand Vishnu are explained as manifestations of Brahma.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this Upanishad is supplementary, but contains several\r\npassages of considerable interest. We have here a cosmogonic myth,\r\nlike those of the Brahmanas, in which the three qualities of matter,\r\nTamas, Rajas, Sattva, are connected with Rudra, Brahma, and Vishnu, and\r\nwhich is in other respects very remarkable as a connecting link between\r\nthe philosophy of the Rigveda and the later Sankhya system. The sun\r\nis further represented as the external, and prana (breath) as the\r\ninternal, symbol of the Atman, their worship being recommended by\r\nmeans of the sacred syllable om, the three \"utterances\" (vyahritis)\r\nbhur, bhuvah, svar, and the famous Savitri stanza. As a means of\r\nattaining Brahma we find a recommendation of Yoga or the ascetic\r\npractices leading to a state of mental concentration and bordering\r\non trance. The information we here receive of these practices is\r\nstill undeveloped compared with the later system. In addition to\r\nthe three conditions of Brahma, waking, dreaming, and deep sleep,\r\nmention is made of a fourth (turiya) and highest stage. The Upanishad\r\nconcludes with the declaration that the Atman entered the world of\r\nduality because it wished to taste both truth and illusion.\r\n\r\nOlder than the Maitrayana, which borrows from them, are two\r\nother Upanishads of the Black Yajurveda, the Kathaka and the\r\nÇvetaçvatara. The former contains some 120 and the latter some 110\r\nstanzas.\r\n\r\nThe Kathaka deals with the legend of Nachiketas, which is told in\r\nthe Kathaka portion of the Taittiriya Brahmana, and a knowledge of\r\nwhich it presupposes. This is indicated by the fact that it begins\r\nwith the same words as the Brahmana story. The treatise appears to\r\nhave consisted originally of the first only of its two chapters. For\r\nthe second, with its more developed notions about Yoga and its much\r\nmore pronounced view as to the unreality of phenomena, looks like\r\na later addition. The first contains an introductory narrative, an\r\naccount of the Atman, of its embodiment and final return by means of\r\nYoga. The second chapter, though less well arranged, on the whole\r\ncorresponds in matter with the first. Its fourth section, while\r\ndiscussing the nature of the Atman, identifies both soul (purusha)\r\nand matter (prakriti) with it. The fifth section deals with the\r\nmanifestation of the Atman in the world, and especially in man. The\r\nway in which it at the same time remains outside them in its full\r\nintegrity and is not affected by the suffering of living beings, is\r\nstrikingly illustrated by the analogy of both light and air, which\r\npervade space and yet embrace every object, and of the sun, the eye\r\nof the universe, which remains free from the blemishes of all other\r\neyes outside of it. In the last section Yoga is taught to be the means\r\nof attaining the highest goal. The gradation of mental faculties here\r\ndescribed is of great interest for the history of the Sankhya and Yoga\r\nsystem. An unconscious contradiction runs through this discussion,\r\ninasmuch as though the Atman is regarded as the all-in-all, a sharp\r\ncontrast is drawn between soul and matter. It is the contradiction\r\nbetween the later Vedanta and the Sankhya-Yoga systems of philosophy.\r\n\r\nAccording to its own statement, the Çvetaçvatara Upanishad derives its\r\nname from an individual author, and the tradition which attributes it\r\nto one of the schools of the Black Yajurveda hardly seems to have a\r\nsufficient foundation. Its confused arrangement, the irregularities\r\nand arbitrary changes of its metres, the number of interpolated\r\nquotations which it contains, make the assumption likely that the\r\nwork in its present form is not the work of a single author. In its\r\npresent form it is certainly later than the Kathaka, since it contains\r\nseveral passages which must be referred to that work, besides many\r\nstanzas borrowed from it with or without variation. Its lateness is\r\nfurther indicated by the developed theory of Yoga which it contains,\r\nbesides the more or less definite form in which it exhibits various\r\nVedanta doctrines either unknown to or only foreshadowed in the\r\nearlier Upanishads. Among these may be mentioned the destruction of\r\nthe world by Brahma at the end of a cosmic age (kalpa), as well as\r\nits periodic renewal out of Brahma, and especially the explanation of\r\nthe world as an illusion (maya) produced by Brahma. At the same time\r\nthe author shows a strange predilection for the personified forms of\r\nBrahma as Savitri, Içana, or Rudra. Though Çiva has not yet become\r\nthe name of Rudra, its frequent use as an adjective connected with\r\nthe latter shows that it is in course of becoming fixed as the proper\r\nname of the highest god. In this Upanishad we meet with a number of\r\nthe terms and fundamental notions of the Sankhya, though the point\r\nof view is thoroughly Vedantist; matter (prakriti), for instance,\r\nbeing represented as an illusion produced by Brahma.\r\n\r\nTo the White Yajurveda is attached the longest, and, beside the\r\nChhandogya, the most important of the Upanishads. It bears even\r\nclearer traces than that work of being a conglomerate of what must\r\noriginally have been separate treatises. It is divided into three\r\nparts, each containing two chapters. The last part is designated, even\r\nin the tradition of the commentaries, as a supplement (Khila-kanda),\r\na statement fully borne out by the contents. That the first and second\r\nparts were also originally independent of each other is sufficiently\r\nproved by both containing the legend of Yajnavalkya and his two\r\nwives in almost identical words throughout. To each of these parts\r\n(as well as to Book x. of the Çatapatha Brahmana) a successive list\r\n(vamça) of teachers is attached. A comparison of these lists seems\r\nto justify the conclusion that the first part (called Madhukanda)\r\nand the second (Yajnavalkya-kanda) existed during nine generations\r\nas independent Upanishads within the school of the White Yajurveda,\r\nand were then combined by a teacher named Agniveçya; the third part,\r\nwhich consists of all kinds of supplementary matter, being subsequently\r\nadded. These lists further make the conclusion probable that the\r\nleading teachers of the ritual tradition (Brahmanas) were different\r\nfrom those of the philosophical tradition (Upanishads).\r\n\r\nBeginning with an allegorical interpretation of the most important\r\nsacrifice, the Açvamedha (horse-sacrifice), as the universe, the first\r\nchapter proceeds to deal with prana (breath) as a symbol of soul,\r\nand then with the creation of the world out of the Atman or Brahma,\r\ninsisting on the dependence of all existence on the Supreme Soul,\r\nwhich appears in every individual as his self. The polemical attitude\r\nadopted against the worship of the gods is characteristic, showing that\r\nthe passage belongs to an early period, in which the doctrine of the\r\nsuperiority of the Atman to the gods was still asserting itself. The\r\nnext chapter deals with the nature of the Atman and its manifestations,\r\npurusha and prana.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the Upanishad consists of four philosophical\r\ndiscussions, in which Yajnavalkya is the chief speaker. The\r\nfirst (iii. 1-9) is a great disputation, in which the sage proves\r\nhis superiority to nine successive interlocutors. One of the most\r\ninteresting conclusions here arrived at is that Brahma is theoretically\r\nunknowable, but can be comprehended practically. The second discourse\r\nis a dialogue between King Janaka and Yajnavalkya, in which the latter\r\nshows the untenableness of six definitions set up by other teachers as\r\nto the nature of Brahma; for instance, that it is identical with Breath\r\nor Mind. He finally declares that the Atman can only be described\r\nnegatively, being intangible, indestructible, independent, immovable.\r\n\r\nThe third discourse (iv. 3-4) is another dialogue between Janaka and\r\nYajnavalkya. It presents a picture of the soul in the conditions of\r\nwaking, dreaming, deep sleep, dying, transmigration, and salvation. For\r\nwealth of illustration, fervour of conviction, beauty and elevation\r\nof thought, this piece is unequalled in the Upanishads or any other\r\nwork of Indian literature. Its literary effect is heightened by the\r\nnumerous stanzas with which it is interspersed. These are, however,\r\ndoubtless later additions. The dreaming soul is thus described:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Leaving its lower nest in breath's protection,\r\n    And upward from that nest, immortal, soaring,\r\n    Where'er it lists it roves about immortal,\r\n    The golden-pinioned only swan of spirit (IV. iii. 13).\r\n\r\n    It roves in dream condition up and downward,\r\n    Divinely many shapes and forms assuming (ib. 14).\r\n\r\n\r\nThen follows an account of the dreamless state of the soul:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    As a falcon or an eagle, having flown about in the air, exhausted\r\n    folds together its wings and prepares to alight, so the spirit\r\n    hastes to that condition in which, asleep, it feels no desire\r\n    and sees no dream (19).\r\n\r\n    This is its essential form, in which it rises above desire,\r\n    is free from evil and without fear. For as one embraced by a\r\n    beloved woman wots not of anything without or within, so also\r\n    the soul embraced by the cognitional Self wots not of anything\r\n    without or within (21).\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the souls of those who are not saved, the view of the\r\nwriter appears to be that after death they enter a new body immediately\r\nand without any intervening retribution in the other world, in exact\r\naccordance with their intellectual and moral quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n    As a caterpillar, when it has reached the point of a leaf, makes a\r\n    new beginning and draws itself across, so the soul, after casting\r\n    off the body and letting go ignorance, makes a new beginning and\r\n    draws itself across (IV. iv. 3).\r\n\r\n    As a goldsmith takes the material of an image and hammers out\r\n    of it another newer and more beautiful form, so also the soul\r\n    after casting off the body and letting go ignorance, creates for\r\n    itself another newer and more beautiful form, either that of the\r\n    Fathers or the Gandharvas or the Gods, or Prajapati or Brahma,\r\n    or other beings (IV. iv. 4).\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the vital airs of him who is saved, who knows himself to be\r\nidentical with Brahma, do not depart, for he is absorbed in Brahma\r\nand is Brahma.\r\n\r\n\r\n    As a serpent's skin, dead and cast off, lies upon an ant-hill,\r\n    so his body then lies; but that which is bodiless and immortal,\r\n    the life, is pure Brahma, is pure light (IV. iv. 7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth discourse is a dialogue between Yajnavalkya and his wife\r\nMaitreyi, before the former, about to renounce the world, retires\r\nto the solitude of the forest. There are several indications that\r\nit is a secondary recension of the same conversation occurring in a\r\nprevious chapter (II. iv.).\r\n\r\nThe first chapter of the third or supplementary part consists of\r\nfifteen sections, which are often quite short, are mostly unconnected\r\nin matter, and appear to be of very different age. The second chapter,\r\nhowever, forms a long and important treatise (identical with that\r\nfound in the Chhandogya) on the doctrine of transmigration. The views\r\nhere expressed are so much at variance with those of Yajnavalkya\r\nthat this text must have originated in another Vedic school, and\r\nhave been loosely attached to this Upanishad owing to the peculiar\r\nimportance of its contents. The preceding and following section,\r\nwhich are connected with it, and are also found in the Chhandogya,\r\nmust have been added at the same time.\r\n\r\nNot only is the longest Upanishad attached to the White Yajurveda,\r\nbut also one of the very shortest, consisting of only eighteen\r\nstanzas. This is the Iça, which is so called from its initial\r\nword. Though forming the last chapter of the Vajasaneyi Samhita, it\r\nbelongs to a rather late period. It is about contemporaneous with the\r\nlatest parts of the Brihadaranyaka, is more developed in many points\r\nthan the Kathaka, but seems to be older than the Çvetaçvatara. Its\r\nleading motive is to contrast him who knows himself to be the same as\r\nthe Atman with him who does not possess true knowledge. It affords\r\nan excellent survey of the fundamental doctrines of the Vedanta\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nA large and indefinite number of Upanishads is attributed to\r\nthe Atharva-veda, but the most authoritative list recognises\r\ntwenty-seven altogether. They are for the most part of very late\r\norigin, being post-Vedic, and, all but three, contemporaneous with\r\nthe Puranas. One of them is actually a Muhammadan treatise entitled\r\nthe Alla Upanishad! The older Upanishads which belong to the first\r\nthree Vedas were, with a few exceptions like the Çvetaçvatara, the\r\ndogmatic text-books of actual Vedic schools, and received their\r\nnames from those schools, being connected with and supplementary\r\nto the ritual Brahmanas. The Upanishads of the Atharva-veda, on the\r\nother hand, are with few exceptions like the Mandukya and the Jabala,\r\nno longer connected with Vedic schools, but derive their names from\r\ntheir subject-matter or some other circumstance. They appear for the\r\nmost part to represent the views of theosophic, mystic, ascetic, or\r\nsectarian associations, who wished to have an Upanishad of their own\r\nin imitation of the old Vedic schools. They became attached to the\r\nAtharva-veda not from any internal connection, but partly because the\r\nfollowers of the Atharva-veda desired to become possessed of dogmatic\r\ntext-books of their own, and partly because the fourth Veda was not\r\nprotected from the intrusion of foreign elements by the watchfulness\r\nof religious guilds like the old Vedic schools.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental doctrine common to all the Upanishads of the\r\nAtharva-veda is developed by most of them in various special\r\ndirections. They may accordingly be divided into four categories\r\nwhich run chronologically parallel with one another, each containing\r\nrelatively old and late productions. The first group, as directly\r\ninvestigating the nature of the Atman, has a scope similar to that of\r\nthe Upanishads of the other Vedas, and goes no further than the latter\r\nin developing its main thesis. The next group, taking the fundamental\r\ndoctrine for granted, treats of absorption in the Atman through\r\nascetic meditation (yoga) based on the component parts of the sacred\r\nsyllable om. These Upanishads are almost without exception composed in\r\nverse and are quite short, consisting on the average of about twenty\r\nstanzas. In the third category the life of the religious mendicant\r\n(sannyasin), as a practical consequence of the Upanishad doctrine,\r\nis recommended and described. These Upanishads, too, are short, but\r\nare written in prose, though with an admixture of verse. The last\r\ngroup is sectarian in character, interpreting the popular gods Çiva\r\n(under various names, such as Içana, Maheçvara, Mahadeva) and Vishnu\r\n(as Narayana and Nrisimha or \"Man-lion\") as personifications of the\r\nAtman. The different Avatars of Vishnu are here regarded as human\r\nmanifestations of the Atman.\r\n\r\nThe oldest and most important of these Atharvan Upanishads, as\r\nrepresenting the Vedanta doctrine most faithfully, are the Mundaka,\r\nthe Praçna, and to a less degree the Mandukya. The first two come\r\nnearest to the Upanishads of the older Vedas, and are much quoted by\r\nBadarayana and Çankara, the great authorities of the later Vedanta\r\nphilosophy. They are the only original and legitimate Upanishads of the\r\nAtharva. The Mundaka derives its name from being the Upanishad of the\r\ntonsured (munda), an association of ascetics who shaved their heads,\r\nas the Buddhist monks did later. It is one of the most popular of the\r\nUpanishads, not owing to the originality of its contents, which are\r\nfor the most part derived from older texts, but owing to the purity\r\nwith which it reproduces the old Vedanta doctrine, and the beauty\r\nof the stanzas in which it is composed. It presupposes, above all,\r\nthe Chhandogya Upanishad, and in all probability the Brihadaranyaka,\r\nthe Taittiriya, and the Kathaka. Having several important passages\r\nin common with the Çvetaçvatara and the Brihannarayana of the Black\r\nYajurveda, it probably belongs to the same epoch, coming between the\r\ntwo in order of time. It consists of three parts, which, speaking\r\ngenerally, deal respectively with the preparations for the knowledge\r\nof Brahma, the doctrine of Brahma, and the way to Brahma.\r\n\r\nThe Praçna Upanishad, written in prose and apparently belonging to\r\nthe Pippalada recension of the Atharva-veda, is so called because it\r\ntreats, in the form of questions (praçna) addressed by six students\r\nof Brahma to the sage Pippalada, six main points of the Vedanta\r\ndoctrine. These questions concern the origin of matter and life\r\n(prana) from Prajapati; the superiority of life (prana) above the\r\nother vital powers; the nature and divisions of the vital powers;\r\ndreaming and dreamless sleep; meditation on the syllable om; and the\r\nsixteen parts of man.\r\n\r\nThe Mandukya is a very short prose Upanishad, which would hardly\r\nfill two pages of the present book. Though bearing the name of\r\na half-forgotten school of the Rigveda, it is reckoned among the\r\nUpanishads of the Atharva-veda. It must date from a considerably\r\nlater time than the prose Upanishads of the three older Vedas, with\r\nthe unmethodical treatment and prolixity of which its precision and\r\nconciseness are in marked contrast. It has many points of contact\r\nwith the Maitrayana Upanishad, to which it seems to be posterior. It\r\nappears, however, to be older than the rest of the treatises which\r\nform the fourth class of the Upanishads of the Atharva-veda. Thus it\r\ndistinguishes only three morae in the syllable om, and not yet three\r\nand a half. The fundamental idea of this Upanishad is that the sacred\r\nsyllable is an expression of the universe. It is somewhat remarkable\r\nthat this work is not quoted by Çankara; nevertheless, it not only\r\nexercised a great influence on several Upanishads of the Atharva-veda,\r\nbut was used more than any other Upanishad by the author of the\r\nwell-known later epitome of the Vedanta doctrine, the Vedanta-sara.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, chiefly important as having given rise to one of\r\nthe most remarkable products of Indian philosophy, the Karika of\r\nGaudapada. This work consists of more than 200 stanzas divided into\r\nfour parts, the first of which includes the Mandukya Upanishad. The\r\nesteem in which the Karika was held is indicated by the fact that\r\nits parts are reckoned as four Upanishads. There is much probability\r\nin the assumption that its author is identical with Gaudapada, the\r\nteacher of Govinda, whose pupil was the great Vedantist commentator,\r\nÇankara (800 A.D.). The point of view of the latter is the same\r\nessentially as that of the author of the Karika, and many of the\r\nthoughts and figures which begin to appear in the earlier work are in\r\ncommon use in Çankara's commentaries. Çankara may, in fact, be said\r\nto have reduced the doctrines of Gaudapada to a system, as did Plato\r\nthose of Parmenides. Indeed, the two leading ideas which pervade the\r\nIndian poem, viz., that there is no duality (advaita) and no becoming\r\n(ajati), are, as Professor Deussen points out, identical with those\r\nof the Greek philosopher.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the Karika is practically a metrical paraphrase\r\nof the Mandukya Upanishad. Peculiar to it is the statement that the\r\nworld is not an illusion or a development in any sense, but the very\r\nnature or essence (svabhava) of Brahma, just as the rays, which are all\r\nthe same (i.e. light), are not different from the sun. The remainder\r\nof the poem is independent of the Upanishad and goes far beyond its\r\ndoctrines. The second part has the special title of Vaitathya or the\r\n\"Falseness\" of the doctrine of reality. Just as a rope is in the\r\ndark mistaken for a snake, so the Atman in the darkness of ignorance\r\nis mistaken for the world. Every attempt to imagine the Atman under\r\nempirical forms is futile, for every one's idea of it is dependent\r\non his experience of the world.\r\n\r\nThe third part is entitled Advaita, \"Non-duality.\" The identity of the\r\nSupreme Soul (Atman) with the individual soul (jiva) is illustrated\r\nby comparison with space, and that part of it which is contained in\r\na jar. Arguing against the theory of genesis and plurality, the poet\r\nlays down the axiom that nothing can become different from its own\r\nnature. The production of the existent (sato janma) is impossible,\r\nfor that would be produced which already exists. The production of the\r\nnon-existent (asato janma) is also impossible, for the non-existent is\r\nnever produced, any more than the son of a barren woman. The last part\r\nis entitled Alata-çanti, or \"Extinction of the firebrand (circle),\"\r\nso called from an ingenious comparison made to explain how plurality\r\nand genesis seem to exist in the world. If a stick which is glowing\r\nat one end is waved about, fiery lines or circles are produced without\r\nanything being added to or issuing from the single burning point. The\r\nfiery line or circle exists only in the consciousness (vijnana). So,\r\ntoo, the many phenomena of the world are merely the vibrations of\r\nthe consciousness, which is one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE SUTRAS\r\n\r\n(Circa 500-200 B.C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Upanishads were a development of the speculative side of the\r\nBrahmanas and constituted the textbooks of Vedic dogma, so the Çrauta\r\nSutras form the continuation of their ritual side, though they are\r\nnot, like the Upanishads, regarded as a part of revelation. A sacred\r\ncharacter was never attributed to them, probably because they were felt\r\nto be treatises compiled, with the help of oral priestly tradition,\r\nfrom the contents of the Brahmanas solely to meet practical needs. The\r\noldest of them seem to go back to about the time when Buddhism came\r\ninto being. Indeed it is quite possible that the rise of the rival\r\nreligion gave the first impetus to the composition of systematic\r\nmanuals of Brahmanic worship. The Buddhists in their turn must have\r\ncome to regard Sutras as the type of treatise best adapted for the\r\nexpression of religious doctrine, for the earliest Pali texts are\r\nworks of this character. The term Kalpa Sutra is used to designate\r\nthe whole body of Sutras concerned with religion which belonged to\r\na particular Vedic school. Where such a complete collection has been\r\npreserved, the Çrauta Sutra forms its first and most extensive portion.\r\n\r\nTo the Rigveda belong the Çrauta manuals of two Sutra schools\r\n(charanas), the Çankhayanas and the Açvalayanas, the former of whom\r\nwere in later times settled in Northern Gujarat, the latter in the\r\nSouth between the Godavari and the Krishna. The ritual is described\r\nin much the same order by both, but the account of the great royal\r\nsacrifices is much more detailed in the Çankhayana Çrauta Sutra. The\r\nlatter, which is closely connected with the Çankhayana Brahmana, seems\r\nto be the older of the two, on the ground both of its matter and of\r\nits style, which in many parts resembles that of the Brahmanas. It\r\nconsists of eighteen books, the last two of which were added later,\r\nand correspond to the first two books of the Kaushitaki Aranyaka. The\r\nÇrauta Sutra of Açvalayana, which consists of twelve books, is related\r\nto the Aitareya Brahmana. Açvalayana is also known as the author\r\nof the fourth book of the Aitareya Aranyaka, and was according to\r\ntradition the pupil of Çaunaka.\r\n\r\nThree Çrauta Sutras to the Samaveda have been preserved. The oldest,\r\nthat of Maçaka, also called Arsheya-kalpa, is nothing more than\r\nan enumeration of the prayers belonging to the various ceremonies\r\nof the Soma sacrifice in the order of the Panchavimça Brahmana. The\r\nÇrauta Sutra composed by Latyayana, became the accepted manual of the\r\nKauthuma school. This Sutra, like that of Maçaka, which it quotes,\r\nis closely connected with the Panchavimça Brahmana. The Çrauta Sutra\r\nof Drahyayana, which differs but little from that of Latyayana,\r\nbelongs to the Ranayaniya branch of the Samaveda.\r\n\r\nTo the White Yajurveda belongs the Çrauta Sutra of Katyayana. This\r\nmanual, which consists of twenty-six chapters, on the whole strictly\r\nfollows the sacrificial order of the Çatapatha Brahmana. Three of\r\nits chapters (xxii.-xxiv.), however, relate to the ceremonial of the\r\nSamaveda. Owing to the enigmatical character of its style, it appears\r\nto be one of the later productions of the Sutra period.\r\n\r\nNo less than six Çrauta Sutras belonging to the Black Yajurveda have\r\nbeen preserved, but only two of them have as yet been published. Four\r\nof these form a very closely connected group, being part of the\r\nKalpa Sutras of four subdivisions of the Taittiriya Çakha, which\r\nrepresented the later sutra schools (charanas) not claiming a special\r\nrevelation of Veda or Brahmana. The Çrauta Sutra of Apastamba forms\r\nthe first twenty-four of the thirty chapters (praçnas) into which his\r\nKalpa Sutra is divided; and that of Hiranyakeçin, an offshoot of the\r\nApastambas, the first eighteen of the twenty-nine chapters of his\r\nKalpa Sutra. The Sutra of Baudhayana, who is older than Apastamba,\r\nas well as that of Bharadvaja, has not yet been published.\r\n\r\nConnected with the Maitrayani Samhita is the Manava Çrauta Sutra. It\r\nbelongs to the Manavas, who were a subdivision of the Maitrayaniyas,\r\nand to whom the law-book of Manu probably traces its origin. It seems\r\nto be one of the oldest. It has a descriptive character, resembling\r\nthe Brahmana parts of the Yajurveda, and differing from them only in\r\nsimply describing the course of the sacrifice, to the exclusion of\r\nlegends, speculations, or discussions of any kind. There is also a\r\nVaikhanasa Çrauta Sutra attached to the Black Yajurveda, but it is\r\nknown only in a few MSS.\r\n\r\nThe Çrauta Sutra of the Atharva-veda is the Vaitana Sutra. It is\r\nneither old nor original, but was undoubtedly compiled in order to\r\nsupply the Atharva, like the other Vedas, with a Sutra of its own. It\r\nprobably received its name from the word with which it begins, since\r\nthe term vaitana (\"relating to the three sacrificial fires\") is equally\r\napplicable to all Çrauta Sutras. It agrees to a considerable extent\r\nwith the Gopatha Brahmana, though it distinctly follows the Sutra of\r\nKatyayana to the White Yajurveda. One indication of its lateness is\r\nthe fact that whereas in other cases a Grihya regularly presupposes\r\nthe Çrauta Sutra, the Vaitana is dependent on the domestic sutra of\r\nthe Atharva-veda.\r\n\r\nThough the Çrauta Sutras are indispensable for the right understanding\r\nof the sacrificial ritual, they are, from any other point of view, a\r\nmost unattractive form of literature. It will, therefore, suffice to\r\nmention in briefest outline the ceremonies with which they deal. It\r\nis important to remember, in the first place, that these rites are\r\nnever congregational, but are always performed on behalf of a single\r\nindividual, the so-called Yajamana or sacrificer, who takes but little\r\npart in them. The officiators are Brahman priests, whose number varies\r\nfrom one to sixteen, according to the nature of the ceremony. In all\r\nthese rites an important part is played by the three sacred fires\r\nwhich surround the vedi, a slightly excavated spot covered with a\r\nlitter of grass for the reception of offerings to the gods. The first\r\nceremony of all is the setting up of the sacred fires (agni-adheya),\r\nwhich are kindled by the sacrificer and his wife with the firesticks,\r\nand are thereafter to be regularly maintained.\r\n\r\nThe Çrauta rites, fourteen in number, are divided into the two\r\nmain groups of seven oblation (havis) sacrifices and seven soma\r\nsacrifices. Different forms of the animal sacrifice are classed with\r\neach group. The havis sacrifices consist of offerings of milk, ghee,\r\nporridge, grain, cakes, and so forth. The commonest is the Agnihotra,\r\nthe daily morning and evening oblation of milk to the three fires. The\r\nmost important of the others are the new and full moon sacrifices\r\n(darçapurna-masa) and those offered at the beginning of the three\r\nseasons (chaturmasya). Besides some other recurrent sacrifices, there\r\nare very many which are to be offered on some particular occasion,\r\nor for the attainment of some special object.\r\n\r\nThe various kinds of Soma sacrifices were much more complicated. Even\r\nthe simplest and fundamental form, the Agnishtoma (\"praise of Agni\")\r\nrequired the ministrations of sixteen priests. This rite occupied only\r\none day, with three pressings of soma, at morning, noon, and evening;\r\nbut this day was preceded by very detailed preparatory ceremonies,\r\none of which was the initiation (diksha) of the sacrificer and his\r\nwife. Other soma sacrifices lasted for several days up to twelve;\r\nwhile another class, called sattras or \"sessions,\" extended to a year\r\nor more.\r\n\r\nA very sacred ceremony that can be connected with the soma sacrifice\r\nis the Agnichayana, or \"Piling of the fire-altar,\" which lasts for\r\na year. It begins with a sacrifice of five animals. Then a long\r\ntime is occupied in preparing the earthenware vessel, called ukha,\r\nin which fire is to be maintained for a year. Very elaborate rules\r\nare given both as to the ingredients, such as the hair of a black\r\nantelope, with which the clay is to be mixed, and as to how it is to\r\nbe shaped, and finally burnt. Then the bricks, which have different\r\nand particular sizes, have to be built up in prescribed order. The\r\nlowest of the five strata must have 1950, all of them together, a\r\ntotal of 10,800 bricks. Many of these have their special name and\r\nsignificance. Thus the altar is gradually built up, as its bricks\r\nare placed in position, to the accompaniment of appropriate rites and\r\nverses, by a formidable array of priests. These are but some of the\r\nmain points in the ceremony; but they will probably give some faint\r\nidea of the enormous complexity and the vast mass of detail, where\r\nthe smallest of minutiæ are of importance, in the Brahman ritual. No\r\nother religion has ever known its like.\r\n\r\nAs the domestic ritual is almost entirely excluded from the Brahmanas,\r\nthe authors of the Grihya Sutras had only the authority of popular\r\ntradition to rely on when they systematised the observances of daily\r\nlife. As a type, the Grihya manuals must be somewhat later than the\r\nÇrauta, for they regularly presuppose a knowledge of the latter.\r\n\r\nTo the Rigveda belongs in the first place the Çankhayana\r\nGrihya Sutra. It consists of six books, but only the first four\r\nform the original portion of the work, and even these contain\r\ninterpolations. Closely connected with this work is the Çambavya\r\nGrihya, which also belongs to the school of the Kaushitakins, and\r\nis as yet known only in manuscript. Though borrowing largely from\r\nÇankhayana, it is not identical with that work. It knows nothing\r\nof the last two books, nor even a number of ceremonies described in\r\nthe third and fourth, while having a book of its own concerning the\r\nsacrifice to the Manes. Connected with the Aitareya Brahmana is the\r\nGrihya Sutra of Açvalayana, which its author in the first aphorism\r\ngives us to understand is a continuation of his Çrauta Sutra. It\r\nconsists of four books, and, like the latter work, ends with the words\r\n\"adoration to Çaunaka.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief Grihya Sutra of the Samaveda is that of Gobhila, which\r\nis one of the oldest, completest, and most interesting works of\r\nthis class. Its seems to have been used by both the schools of its\r\nVeda. Besides the text of the Samaveda it presupposes the Mantra\r\nBrahmana. The latter is a collection, in the ritual order, of the\r\nmantras (except those occurring in the Samaveda itself), which are\r\nquoted by Gobhila in an abbreviated form. The Grihya Sutra of Khadira,\r\nbelonging to the Drahyayana school and used by the Ranayaniya branch\r\nof the Samaveda, is little more than Gobhila remodelled in a more\r\nsuccinct form.\r\n\r\nThe Grihya Sutra of the White Yajurveda is that of Paraskara,\r\nalso called the Katiya or Vajasaneya Grihya Sutra. It is so closely\r\nconnected with the Çrauta Sutra of Katyayana, that it is often quoted\r\nunder the name of that author. The later law-book of Yajnavalkya\r\nbears evidence of the influence of Paraskara's work.\r\n\r\nOf the seven Grihya Sutras of the Black Yajurveda only three have\r\nas yet been published. The Grihya of Apastamba forms two books\r\n(26-27) of his Kalpa Sutra. The first of these two books is the\r\nMantrapatha, which is a collection of the formulas accompanying the\r\nceremonies. The Grihya Sutra, in the strict sense, is the second book,\r\nwhich presupposes the Mantrapatha. Books XIX. and XX. of Hiranyakeçin's\r\nKalpa Sutra form his Grihya Sutra. About Baudhayana's Grihya not much\r\nis known, still less about that of Bharadvaja. The Manava Grihya Sutra\r\nis closely connected with the Çrauta, repeating many of the statements\r\nof the latter verbally. It is interesting as containing a ceremony\r\nunknown to other Grihya Sutras, the worship of the Vinayakas. The\r\npassage reappears in a versified form in Yajnavalkya's law-book,\r\nwhere the four Vinayakas are transformed into the one Vinayaka, the\r\ngod Ganeça. With the Manava is clearly connected the Kathaka Grihya\r\nSutra, not only in the principle of its arrangement, but even in\r\nthe wording of many passages. It is nearly related to the law-book\r\nof Vishnu. The Vaikhanasa Grihya Sutra is an extensive work bearing\r\ntraces of a late origin, and partly treating of subjects otherwise\r\nrelegated to works of a supplementary character.\r\n\r\nTo the Atharva-veda belongs the important Kauçika Sutra. It is not\r\na mere Grihya Sutra, for besides giving the more important rules of\r\nthe domestic ritual, it deals with the magical and other practices\r\nspecially connected with its Veda. By its extensive references to\r\nthese subjects it supplies much material unknown to other Vedic\r\nschools. It is a composite work, apparently made up of four or five\r\ndifferent treatises. In combination with the Atharva-veda it supplies\r\nan almost complete picture of the ordinary life of the Vedic Indian.\r\n\r\nThe Grihya Sutras give the rules for the numerous ceremonies\r\napplicable to the domestic life of a man and his family from birth\r\nto the grave. For the performance of their ritual only the domestic\r\n(avasathya or vaivahika) fire was required, as contrasted with the\r\nthree sacrificial fires of the Çrauta Sutras. They describe forty\r\nconsecrations or sacraments (samskaras) which are performed at\r\nvarious important epochs in the life of the individual. The first\r\neighteen, extending from conception to marriage, are called \"bodily\r\nsacraments.\" The remaining twenty-two are sacrifices. Eight of these,\r\nthe five daily sacrifices (mahayajna) and some other \"baked offerings\"\r\n(pakayajna), form part of the Grihya ceremonies, the rest belonging\r\nto the Çrauta ritual.\r\n\r\nThe first of the sacraments is the pumsavana or ceremony aiming\r\nat the obtainment of a son. The most common expedient prescribed\r\nis the pounded shoot of a banyan tree placed in the wife's right\r\nnostril. After the birth-rites (jata-karma), the ceremony of giving\r\nthe child its names (nama-karana) takes place, generally on the tenth\r\nday after birth. Two are given, one being the \"secret name,\" known\r\nonly to the parents, as a protection against witchcraft, the other for\r\ncommon use. Minute directions are given as to the quality of the name;\r\nfor instance, that it should contain an even number of syllables,\r\nbegin with a soft letter, and have a semi-vowel in the middle; that\r\nfor a Brahman it should end in -çarman, for a Kshatriya in -varman,\r\nand a Vaiçya in -gupta. Generally in the third year takes place the\r\nceremony of tonsure (chuda-karana), when the boy's hair was cut, one\r\nor more tufts being left on the top, so that his hair might be worn\r\nafter the fashion prevailing in his family. In the sixteenth year the\r\nrite of shaving the beard was performed. Its name, go-dana, or \"gift\r\nof cows,\" is due to the fee usually having been a couple of cattle.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important ceremony of boyhood was that of\r\napprenticeship to a teacher or initiation (upanayana), which in the\r\ncase of a Brahman may take place between the eighth and sixteenth\r\nyear, but a few years later in the case of the Kshatriya and the\r\nVaiçya. On this occasion the youth receives a staff, a garment, a\r\ngirdle, and a cord worn over one shoulder and under the other arm. The\r\nfirst is made of different wood, the others of different materials\r\naccording to caste. The sacred cord is the outward token of the Arya\r\nor member of one of the three highest castes, and by investiture with\r\nit he attains his second birth, being thenceforward a \"twice-born\"\r\nman (dvi-ja). The spiritual significance of this initiation is the\r\nright to study the Veda, and especially to recite the most sacred\r\nof prayers, the Savitri. In this ceremony the teacher (acharya)\r\nwho initiates the young Brahman is regarded as his spiritual father,\r\nand the Savitri as his mother.\r\n\r\nThe rite of upanayana is still practised in India. It is based on a\r\nvery old custom. The Avestan ceremony of investing the boy of fifteen\r\nwith a sacred cord upon his admission into the Zoroastrian community\r\nshows that it goes back to Indo-Iranian times. The prevalence among\r\nprimitive races all over the world of a rite of initiation, regarded as\r\na second birth, upon the attainment of manhood, indicates that it was\r\na still older custom, which in the Brahman system became transformed\r\ninto a ceremony of admission to Vedic study.\r\n\r\nBesides his studies, the course of which is regulated by detailed\r\nrules, the constant duties of the pupil are the collection of fuel,\r\nthe performance of devotions at morning and evening twilight, begging\r\nfood, sleeping on the ground, and obedience to his teacher.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of religious studentship (brahmacharya), which lasted\r\nfor twelve years, or till the pupil had mastered his Veda, he performs\r\nthe rite of return (samavartana), the principal part of which is a\r\nbath, with which he symbolically washes off his apprenticeship. He is\r\nnow a snataka (\"one who has bathed\"), and soon proceeds to the most\r\nimportant sacrament of his life, marriage. The main elements of this\r\nceremony doubtless go back to the Indo-European period, and belong\r\nrather to the sphere of witchcraft than of the sacrificial cult. The\r\ntaking of her hand placed the bride in the power of her husband. The\r\nstone on which she stepped was to give her firmness. The seven steps\r\nwhich she took with her husband, and the sacrificial food which she\r\nshared with him, were to inaugurate friendship and community. Future\r\nabundance and male offspring were prognosticated when she had been\r\nconducted to her husband's house, by seating her on the hide of a\r\nred bull and placing upon her lap the son of a woman who had only\r\nborne living male children. The god most closely connected with\r\nthe rite was Agni; for the husband led his bride three times round\r\nthe nuptial fire--whence the Sanskrit name for wedding, pari-naya,\r\n\"leading round\"--and the newly kindled domestic fire was to accompany\r\nthe couple throughout life. Offerings are made to it and Vedic formulas\r\npronounced. After sunset the husband leads out his bride, and as\r\nhe points to the pole-star and the star Arundhati, they exhort each\r\nother to be constant and undivided for ever. These wedding ceremonies,\r\npreserved much as they are described in the Sutras, are still widely\r\nprevalent in the India of to-day.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned sacraments are exclusively meant for males,\r\nthe only one in which girls had a share being marriage (vivaha). About\r\ntwelve of these Samskaras are still practised in India, investiture\r\nbeing still the most important next to marriage. Some of the ceremonies\r\nonly survive in a symbolical form, as those connected with religious\r\nstudentship.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important duties of the new householder is the regular\r\ndaily offering of the five great sacrifices (maha-yajna), which are\r\nthe sacrifice to the Veda (brahma-yajna), or Vedic recitation; the\r\noffering to the gods (deva-yajna) of melted butter in fire (homa); the\r\nlibation (tarpana) to the Manes (pitri-yajna); offerings (called bali)\r\ndeposited in various places on the ground to demons and all beings\r\n(bhuta-yajna); and the sacrifice to men (manushya-yajna), consisting in\r\nhospitality, especially to Brahman mendicants. The first is regarded\r\nas by far the highest; the recitation of the savitri, in particular,\r\nat morning and evening worship, is as meritorious as having studied\r\nthe Veda. All these five daily sacrifices are still in partial use\r\namong orthodox Brahmans.\r\n\r\nThere are other sacrifices which occur periodically. Such are the\r\nnew and full moon sacrifices, in which, according to the Grihya\r\nritual, a baked offering (paka-yajna) is made, while, according to\r\nthe Çrauta ceremony, cakes (purodaça) are offered. There is, further,\r\nat the beginning of the rains an offering made to serpents, when the\r\nuse of a raised bed is enjoined, owing to the danger from snakes at\r\nthat time. Various ceremonies are connected with the building and\r\nentering of a new house. Detailed rules are given about the site\r\nas well as the construction. A door on the west is, for instance,\r\nforbidden. On the completion of the house, which is built of wood\r\nand bamboo, an animal is sacrificed. Other ceremonies are concerned\r\nwith cattle; for instance, the release of a young bull for the\r\nbenefit of the community. Then there are agricultural ceremonies,\r\nsuch as the offering of the first-fruits and rites connected with\r\nploughing. Mention is also made of offerings to monuments (chaityas)\r\nerected to the memory of teachers. There are, moreover, directions as\r\nto what is to be done in case of evil dreams, bad omens, and disease.\r\n\r\nFinally, one of the most interesting subjects with which the Grihya\r\nSutras deal is that of funeral rites (antyeshti) and the worship\r\nof the Manes. All but children under two years of age are to be\r\ncremated. The dead man's hair and beard are cut off and his nails\r\ntrimmed, the body being anointed with nard and a wreath being placed\r\non the head. Before being burnt the corpse is laid on a black antelope\r\nskin. In the case of a Kshatriya, his bow (in that of a Brahman his\r\nstaff, of a Vaiçya his goad) is taken from his hand, broken, and cast\r\non the pyre, while a cow or a goat is burnt with the corpse. Afterwards\r\na purifying ablution is performed by all relations to the seventh\r\nor tenth degree. They then sit down on a grassy spot and listen to\r\nold stories or a sermon on the transitoriness of life till the stars\r\nappear. At last, without looking round, they return in procession to\r\ntheir homes, where various observances are gone through. A death is\r\nfollowed by a period of impurity, generally lasting three days, during\r\nwhich the relatives are required, among other things, to sleep on the\r\nground and refrain from eating flesh. On the night after the death\r\na cake is offered to the deceased, and a libation of water is poured\r\nout; a vessel with milk and water is also placed in the open air, and\r\nthe dead man is called upon to bathe in it. Generally after the tenth\r\nday the bones are collected and placed in an urn, which is buried to\r\nthe accompaniment of the Rigvedic verse, \"Approach thy mother earth\"\r\n(x. 18, 10).\r\n\r\nThe soul is supposed to remain separated from the Manes for a time as a\r\npreta or \"ghost.\" A çraddha, or \"offering given with faith\" (çraddha),\r\nof which it is the special object (ekoddishta), is presented to it in\r\nthis state, the idea being that it would otherwise return and disquiet\r\nthe relatives. Before the expiry of a year he is admitted to the\r\ncircle of the Manes by a rite which makes him their sapinda (\"united\r\nby the funeral cake\"). After the lapse of a year or more another\r\nelaborate ceremony (called pitri-medha) takes place in connection\r\nwith the erection of a monument, when the bones are taken out of the\r\nurn and buried in a suitable place. There are further various general\r\nofferings to the Manes, or çraddhas, which take place at fixed periods,\r\nsuch as that on the day of new moon (parvana çraddha), while others\r\nare only occasional and optional. These rites still play an important\r\npart in India, well-to-do families in Bengal spending not less than\r\n5000 to 6000 rupees on their first çraddha.\r\n\r\nFrom all these offerings of the Grihya ritual are to be distinguished\r\nthe two regular sacrifices of the Çrauta ritual, the one called\r\nPinda-pitri-yajna immediately preceding the new-moon sacrifice, the\r\nother being connected with the third of the four-monthly sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial of ancestor-worship was especially elaborated, and\r\ndeveloped a special literature of its own, extending from the Vedic\r\nperiod to the legal Compendia of the Middle Ages. The Çraddha-kalpa\r\nof Hemadri comprises upwards of 1700 pages in the edition of the\r\nBibliotheca Indica.\r\n\r\nThe above is the briefest possible sketch of the abundant material\r\nof the Grihya Sutras, illustrating the daily domestic life of ancient\r\nIndia. Perhaps, however, enough has been said to show that they have\r\nmuch human interest, and that they occupy an important place in the\r\nhistory of civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe second branch of the Sutra literature, based on tradition or\r\nSmriti, are the Dharma Sutras, which deal with the customs of everyday\r\nlife (samayacharika). They are the earliest Indian works on law,\r\ntreating fully of its religious, but only partially and briefly of\r\nits secular, aspect. The term Dharma Sutra is, strictly speaking,\r\napplied to those collections of legal aphorisms which form part\r\nof the body of Sutras belonging to a particular branch (çakha) of\r\nthe Veda. In this sense only three have been preserved, all of them\r\nattached to the Taittiriya division of the Black Yajurveda. But there\r\nis good reason to suppose that other works of the same kind which\r\nhave been preserved, or are known to have existed, were originally\r\nalso attached to individual Vedic schools. That Sutras on Dharma were\r\ncomposed at a very early period is shown by the fact that Yaska, who\r\ndates from near the beginning of the Sutra age, quotes legal rules\r\nin the Sutra style. Indeed, one or two of those extant must go back\r\nto about his time.\r\n\r\nThe Dharma Sutra which has been best preserved, and has remained free\r\nfrom the influence of sectarians or modern editors, is that of the\r\nApastambas. It forms two (28-29) of the thirty sections of the great\r\nApastamba Kalpa Sutra, or body of aphorisms concerning the performance\r\nof sacrifices and the duties of the three upper classes. It deals\r\nchiefly with the duties of the Vedic student and of the householder,\r\nwith forbidden food, purifications, and penances, while, on the\r\nsecular side, it touches upon the law of marriage, inheritance, and\r\ncrime only. From the disapprobation which the author expresses for a\r\ncertain practice of the people of the North, it may be inferred that he\r\nbelonged to the South, where his school is known to have been settled\r\nin later times. Owing to the pre-Paninean character of its language and\r\nother criteria, Bühler has assigned this Dharma Sutra to about 400 B.C.\r\n\r\nVery closely connected with this work is the Dharma Sutra of\r\nHiranyakeçin; for the differences between the two do not go much\r\nbeyond varieties of reading. In keeping with this relationship is\r\nthe tradition that Hiranyakeçin branched off from the Apastambas\r\nand founded a new school in the Konkan country on the south-west\r\n(about Goa). The lower limit for this separation from the Apastambas\r\nis about 500 A.D., when a Hiranyakeçin Brahman is mentioned in an\r\ninscription. The main importance of this Sutra lies in its confirming,\r\nby the parallelism of its text, the genuineness of by far the greatest\r\npart of Apastamba's work. It forms two (26-27) of the twenty-nine\r\nchapters of the Kalpa Sutra belonging to the school of Hiranyakeçin.\r\n\r\nThe third Dharma Sutra, generally styled a dharmaçastra in the MSS.,\r\nis that of Baudhayana. Its position, however, within the Kalpa Sutra\r\nof its school is not so fixed as in the two previous cases. Its\r\nsubject-matter, when compared with that of Apastamba's Dharma Sutra,\r\nindicates that it is the older of the two, just as the more archaic\r\nand awkward style of Baudhayana's Grihya Sutra shows the latter to\r\nbe earlier than the corresponding work of Apastamba. The Baudhayana\r\nschool cannot be traced at the present day, but it appears to have\r\nbelonged to Southern India, where the famous Vedic commentator Sayana\r\nwas a member of it in the fourteenth century. The subjects dealt with\r\nin their Dharma Sutra are multifarious, including the duties of the\r\nfour religious orders, the mixed castes, various kinds of sacrifice,\r\npurification, penance, auspicious ceremonies, duties of kings, criminal\r\njustice, examination of witnesses, law of inheritance and marriage,\r\nthe position of women. The fourth section, which is almost entirely\r\ncomposed in çlokas, is probably a modern addition, and even the third\r\nis of somewhat doubtful age.\r\n\r\nWith the above works must be classed the well-preserved law-book of\r\nGautama. Though it does not form part of a Kalpa Sutra, it must at\r\none time have been connected with a Vedic school; for the Gautamas are\r\nmentioned as a subdivision of the Ranayaniya branch of the Samaveda,\r\nand Kumarila's statement that Gautama's treatise originally belonged\r\nto that Veda is confirmed by the fact that its twenty-sixth section is\r\ntaken word for word from the Samavidhana Brahmana. Though entitled\r\na Dharma Çastra, it is in style and character a regular Dharma\r\nSutra. It is composed entirely in prose aphorisms, without any\r\nadmixture of verse, as in the other works of this class. Its varied\r\ncontents resemble and are treated much in the same way as those of\r\nthe Dharma Sutra of Baudhayana. The latter has indeed been shown\r\nto contain passages based on or borrowed from Gautama's work, which\r\nis therefore the oldest Dharma Sutra that has been preserved, or at\r\nleast published, and can hardly date from later than about 500 B.C.\r\n\r\nAnother work of the Sutra type, and belonging to the Vedic period,\r\nis the Dharma Çastra of Vasishtha. It has survived only in inferior\r\nMSS., and without the preserving influence of a commentary. It contains\r\nthirty chapters (adhyayas), of which the last five appear to consist\r\nfor the most part of late additions. Many of the Sutras, not only\r\nhere, but even in the older portions, are hopelessly corrupt. The\r\nprose aphorisms of the work are intermingled with verse, the archaic\r\ntrishtubh metre being frequently employed instead of the later çlokas\r\nof Manu and others. The contents, which bear the Dharma Sutra stamp,\r\nproduce the impression of antiquity in various respects. Thus here,\r\nas in the Dharma Sutra of Apastamba, only six forms of marriage are\r\nrecognised, instead of the orthodox eight. Kumarila states that in\r\nhis time Vasishtha's law-book, while acknowledged to have general\r\nauthority, was studied by followers of the Rigveda only. That he\r\nmeant the present work and no other, is proved by the quotations\r\nfrom it which he gives, and which are found in the published text. As\r\nVasishtha, in citing Vedic Samhitas and Sutras, shows a predilection\r\nfor works belonging to the North of India, it is to be inferred that\r\nhe or his school belonged to that part. Vasishtha gives a quotation\r\nfrom Gautama which appears to refer to a passage in the extant text of\r\nthe latter. His various quotations from Manu are derived, not from the\r\nlater famous law-book, but evidently from a legal Sutra related to our\r\nManu. On the other hand, the extant text of Manu contains a quotation\r\nfrom Vasishtha which actually occurs in the published edition of the\r\nlatter. Hence Vasishtha's work must be later than that of Gautama,\r\nand earlier than that of Manu. It is further probable that the original\r\npart of the Sutra of a school connected with the Rigveda and belonging\r\nto the North dates from a period some centuries before our era.\r\n\r\nSome Dharma Sutras are known from quotations only, the oldest being\r\nthose mentioned in other Dharma Sutras. Particular interest attaches\r\nto one of these, the Sutra of Manu, or the Manavas, because of its\r\nrelationship to the famous Manava dharma-çastra. Of the numerous\r\nquotations from it in Vasishtha, six are found unaltered or but\r\nslightly modified in our text of Manu. One passage cited in Vasishtha\r\nis composed partly in prose and partly in verse, the latter portion\r\nrecurring in Manu. The metrical quotations show a mixture of trishtubh\r\nand çloka verses, like other Dharma Sutras. These quoted fragments\r\nprobably represent a Manava dharma-sutra which supplied the basis of\r\nour Manava dharma-çastra or Code of Manu.\r\n\r\nFragments of a legal treatise in prose and verse, attributed to the\r\nbrothers Çankha and Likhita, who became proverbial for justice, have\r\nbeen similarly preserved. This work, which must have been extensive,\r\nand dealt with all branches of law, is already quoted as authoritative\r\nby Paraçara. The statement of Kumarila (700 A.D.) that it was connected\r\nwith the Vajasaneyin school of the White Yajurveda is borne out by\r\nthe quotations from it which have survived.\r\n\r\nSutras need not necessarily go back to the oldest period of Indian\r\nlaw, as this style of composition was never entirely superseded by\r\nthe use of metre. Thus there is a Vaikhanasa dharma-sutra in four\r\npraçnas, which, as internal evidence shows, cannot be earlier than\r\nthe third century A.D. It refers to the cult of Narayana (Vishnu),\r\nand mentions Wednesday by the name of budha-vara, \"day of Mercury.\" It\r\nis not a regular Dharma Sutra, for it contains nothing connected\r\nwith law in the strict sense, but is only a treatise on domestic law\r\n(grihya-dharma). It deals with the religious duties of the four orders\r\n(açramas), especially with those of the forest hermit. For it is\r\nwith the latter order that the Vaikhanasas, or followers of Vikhanas,\r\nare specially connected. They seem to have been one of the youngest\r\noffshoots of the Taittiriya school.\r\n\r\nLooking back on the vast mass of ritual and usage regulated by the\r\nSutras, we are tempted to conclude that it was entirely the conscious\r\nwork of an idle priesthood, invented to enslave and maintain in\r\nspiritual servitude the minds of the Hindu people. But the progress\r\nof research tends to show that the basis even of the sacerdotal ritual\r\nof the Brahmans was popular religious observances. Otherwise it would\r\nbe hard to understand how Brahmanism acquired and retained such a\r\nhold on the population of India. The originality of the Brahmans\r\nconsisted in elaborating and systematising observances which they\r\nalready found in existence. This they certainly succeeded in doing\r\nto an extent unknown elsewhere.\r\n\r\nComparative studies have shown that many ritual practices go back to\r\nthe period when the Indians and Persians were still one people. Thus\r\nthe sacrifice was even then the centre of a developed ceremonial, and\r\nwas tended by a priestly class. Many terms of the Vedic ritual already\r\nexisted then, especially soma, which was pressed, purified through a\r\nsieve, mixed with milk, and offered as the main libation. Investiture\r\nwith a sacred cord was, as we have seen, also known, and was in its\r\nturn based on the still older ceremony of the initiation of youths\r\non entering manhood. The offering of gifts to the gods in fire is\r\nIndo-European, as is shown by the agreement of the Greeks, Romans,\r\nand Indians. Indo-European also is that part of the marriage ritual\r\nin which the newly wedded couple walk round the nuptial fire, the\r\nbridegroom presenting a burnt offering and the bride an offering\r\nof grain; for among the Romans also the young pair walked round\r\nthe altar from left to right before offering bread (far) in the\r\nfire. Indo-European, too, must be the practice of scattering rice\r\nor grain (as a symbol of fertility) over the bride and bridegroom,\r\nas prescribed in the Sutras; for it is widely diffused among peoples\r\nwho cannot have borrowed it. Still older is the Indian ceremony\r\nof producing the sacrificial fire by the friction of two pieces\r\nof wood. Similarly the practice in the construction of the Indian\r\nfire-altar of walling up in the lowest layer of bricks the heads\r\nof five different victims, including that of a man, goes back to an\r\nancient belief that a building can only be firmly erected when a man\r\nor an animal is buried with its foundations.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have as a division of the Sutras, concerned with religious\r\npractice, the Çulva Sutras. The thirtieth and last praçna of the\r\ngreat Kalpa Sutra of Apastamba is a treatise of this class. These\r\nare practical manuals giving the measurements necessary for the\r\nconstruction of the vedi, of the altars, and so forth. They show\r\nquite an advanced knowledge of geometry, and constitute the oldest\r\nIndian mathematical works.\r\n\r\nThe whole body of Vedic works composed in the Sutra style, is according\r\nto the Indian traditional view, divided into six classes called\r\nVedangas (\"members of the Veda\"). These are çiksha or phonetics;\r\nchhandas, or metre; vyakarana, or grammar; nirukta, or etymology;\r\nkalpa, or religious practice; and jyotisha, or astronomy. The first\r\nfour were meant as aids to the correct reciting and understanding of\r\nthe sacred texts; the last two deal with religious rites or duties,\r\nand their proper seasons. They all have their origin in the exigencies\r\nof religion, and the last four furnish the beginnings or (in one case)\r\nthe full development of five branches of science that flourished in\r\nthe post-Vedic period. In the fourth and sixth group the name of the\r\nclass has been applied to designate a particular work representing it.\r\n\r\nOf kalpa we have already treated at length above. No work representing\r\nastronomy has survived from the Vedic period; for the Vedic calendar,\r\ncalled jyotisha, the two recensions of which profess to belong to\r\nthe Rigveda and Yajurveda respectively, dates from far on in the\r\npost-Vedic age.\r\n\r\nThe Taittiriya Aranyaka (vii. 1) already mentions çiksha, or phonetics,\r\na subject which even then appears to have dealt with letters, accents,\r\nquantity, pronunciation, and euphonic rules. Several works bearing\r\nthe title of çiksha have been preserved, but they are only late\r\nsupplements of Vedic literature. They are short manuals containing\r\ndirections for Vedic recitation and correct pronunciation. The\r\nearliest surviving results of phonetic studies are of course the\r\nSamhita texts of the various Vedas, which were edited in accordance\r\nwith euphonic rules. A further advance was made by the constitution\r\nof the pada-patha, or word-text of the Vedas, which, by resolving\r\nthe euphonic combinations and giving each word (even the parts of\r\ncompounds) separately, in its original form unmodified by phonetic\r\nrules, furnished a basis for all subsequent studies. Yaska, Panini, and\r\nother grammarians do not always accept the analyses of the Padapathas\r\nwhen they think they understand a Vedic form better. Patanjali even\r\ndirectly contests their authoritativeness. The treatises really\r\nrepresentative of Vedic phonetics are the Pratiçakhyas, which are\r\ndirectly connected with the Samhita and Padapatha. It is their object\r\nto determine the relation of these to each other. In so doing they\r\nfurnish a systematic account of Vedic euphonic combination, besides\r\nadding phonetic discussions to secure the correct recitation of the\r\nsacred texts. They are generally regarded as anterior to Panini,\r\nwho shows unmistakable points of contact with them. It is perhaps\r\nmore correct to suppose that Panini used the present Pratiçakhyas in\r\nan older form, as, whenever he touches on Vedic sandhi, he is always\r\nless complete in his statements than they are, while the Pratiçakhyas,\r\nespecially that of the Atharva-veda, are dependent on the terminology\r\nof the grammarians. Four of these treatises have been preserved\r\nand published. One belongs to the Rigveda, another to the Atharva-,\r\nand two to the Yajur-veda, being attached to the Vajasaneyi and the\r\nTaittiriya Samhita respectively. They are so called because intended\r\nfor the use of each respective branch (çakha) of the Vedas.\r\n\r\nThe Pratiçakhya Sutra of the Rigveda is an extensive metrical work\r\nin three books, traditionally attributed to Çaunaka, the teacher of\r\nAçvalayana; it may, however, in its present form only be a production\r\nof the school of Çaunaka. This Pratiçakhya was later epitomised, with\r\nthe addition of some supplementary matter, in a short treatise entitled\r\nUpalekha. The Taittiriya Pratiçakhya is particularly interesting\r\nowing to the various peculiar names of teachers occurring among\r\nthe twenty which it mentions. The Vajasaneyi Pratiçakhya, in eight\r\nchapters, names Katyayana as its author, and mentions Çaunaka among\r\nother predecessors. The Atharva-veda Pratiçakhya, in four chapters,\r\nbelonging to the school of the Çaunakas, is more grammatical than\r\nthe other works of this class.\r\n\r\nMetre, to which there are many scattered references in the Brahmanas,\r\nis separately treated in a section of the Çankhayana Çrauta Sutra (7,\r\n27), in the last three sections (patalas) of the Rigveda Pratiçakhya,\r\nand especially in the Nidana Sutra, which belongs to the Samaveda. A\r\npart of the Chhandah Sutra of Pingala also deals with Vedic metres; but\r\nthough it claims to be a Vedanga, it is in reality a late supplement,\r\ndealing chiefly with post-Vedic prosody, on which, indeed, it is the\r\nstandard authority.\r\n\r\nFinally, Katyayana's two Anukramanis or indices, mentioned below,\r\neach contains a section, varying but slightly from the other, on Vedic\r\nmetres. These sections are, however, almost identical in matter with\r\nthe sixteenth patala of the Rigveda Pratiçakhya, and may possibly be\r\nolder than the corresponding passage in the Pratiçakhya, though the\r\nlatter work as a whole is doubtless anterior to the Anukramani.\r\n\r\nThe Padapathas show that their authors had not only made investigations\r\nas to pronunciation and Sandhi, but already knew a good deal about\r\nthe grammatical analysis of words; for they separate both the parts of\r\ncompounds and the prefixes of verbs, as well as certain suffixes and\r\nterminations of nouns. They had doubtless already distinguished the\r\nfour parts of speech (padajatani), though these are first mentioned by\r\nYaska as naman, or \"noun\" (including sarva-naman, \"representing all\r\nnouns\" or \"pronouns\"), akhyata, \"predicate,\" i.e. \"verb\"; upasarga,\r\n\"supplement,\" i.e. \"preposition\"; nipata, \"incidental addition,\"\r\ni.e. \"particle.\" It is perhaps to the separation of these categories\r\nthat the name for grammar, vyakarana, originally referred, rather\r\nthan to the analysis of words. Even the Brahmanas bear evidence of\r\nlinguistic investigations, for they mention various grammatical\r\nterms, such as \"letter\" (varna), \"masculine\" (vrishan), \"number\"\r\n(vachana), \"case-form\" (vibhakti).Still more such references are to\r\nbe found in the Aranyakas, the Upanishads, and the Sutras. But the\r\nmost important information we have of pre-Paninean grammar is that\r\nfound in Yaska's work.\r\n\r\nGrammatical studies must have been cultivated to a considerable\r\nextent before Yaska's time, for he distinguishes a Northern and\r\nan Eastern school, besides mentioning nearly twenty predecessors,\r\namong whom Çakatayana, Gargya, and Çakalya are the most important. By\r\nthe time of Yaska grammarians had learned to distinguish clearly\r\nbetween the stem and the formative elements of words; recognising\r\nthe personal terminations and the tense affixes of the verb on\r\nthe one hand, and primary (krit) or secondary (taddhita) nominal\r\nsuffixes on the other. Yaska has an interesting discussion on the\r\ntheory of Çakatayana, which he himself follows, that nouns are\r\nderived from verbs. Gargya and some other grammarians, he shows,\r\nadmit this theory in a general way, but deny that it is applicable\r\nto all nouns. He criticises their objections, and finally dismisses\r\nthem as untenable. On Çakatayana's theory of the verbal origin\r\nof nouns the whole system of Panini is founded. The sutra of that\r\ngrammarian contains hundreds of rules dealing with Vedic forms; but\r\nthese are of the nature of exceptions to the main body of his rules,\r\nwhich are meant to describe the Sanskrit language. His work almost\r\nentirely dominates the subsequent literature. Though belonging to\r\nthe middle of the Sutra period, it must be regarded as the definite\r\nstarting-point of the post-Vedic age. Coming to be regarded as an\r\ninfallible authority, Panini superseded all his predecessors, whose\r\nworks have consequently perished. Yaska alone survives, and that only\r\nbecause he was not directly a grammarian; for his work represents,\r\nand alone represents, the Vedanga \"etymology.\"\r\n\r\nYaska's Nirukta is in reality a Vedic commentary, and is older by some\r\ncenturies than any other exegetical work preserved in Sanskrit. Its\r\nbases are the Nighantus, collections of rare or obscure Vedic words,\r\narranged for the use of teachers. Yaska had before him five such\r\ncollections. The first three contain groups of synonyms, the fourth\r\nspecially difficult words, and the fifth a classification of the\r\nVedic gods. These Yaska explained for the most part in the twelve\r\nbooks of his commentary (to which two others were added later). In\r\nso doing he adduces as examples a large number of verses, chiefly\r\nfrom the Rigveda, which he interprets with many etymological remarks.\r\n\r\nThe first book is an introduction, dealing with the principles\r\nof grammar and exegesis. The second and third elucidate certain\r\npoints in the synonymous nighantus; Books IV.-VI. comment on the\r\nfourth section, and VII.-XII. on the fifth. The Nirukta, besides\r\nbeing very important from the point of view of exegesis and grammar,\r\nis highly interesting as the earliest specimen of Sanskrit prose of\r\nthe classical type, considerably earlier than Panini himself. Yaska\r\nalready uses essentially the same grammatical terminology as Panini,\r\nemploying, for instance, the same words for root (dhatu), primary,\r\nand secondary suffixes. But he must have lived a long time before\r\nPanini; for a considerable number of important grammarians' names are\r\nmentioned between them. Yaska must, therefore, go back to the fifth\r\ncentury, and undoubtedly belongs to the beginning of the Sutra period.\r\n\r\nOne point of very great importance proved by the Nirukta is that the\r\nRigveda had a very fixed form in Yaska's time, and was essentially\r\nidentical with our text. His deviations are very insignificant. Thus\r\nin one passage (X. 29. I) he reads vayó as one word, against va\r\nyó as two words in Çakalya's Pada text. Yaska's paraphrases show\r\nthat he also occasionally differed from the Samhita text, though\r\nthe quotations themselves from the Rigveda have been corrected so\r\nas to agree absolutely with the traditional text. But these slight\r\nvariations are probably due to mistakes in the Nirukta rather than\r\nto varieties of reading in the Rigveda. There are a few insignificant\r\ndeviations of this kind even in Sayana, but they are always manifestly\r\noversights on the part of the commentator.\r\n\r\nTo the Sutras is attached a very extensive literature of Pariçishtas\r\nor \"supplements,\" which seem to have existed in all the Vedic\r\nschools. They contain details on matters only touched upon in the\r\nSutras, or supplementary information about subjects not dealt with at\r\nall by them. Thus, there is the Açvalayana Grihya-pariçishta, in four\r\nchapters, connected with the Rigveda. The Gobhila samgraha-pariçishta\r\nis a compendium of Grihya practices in general, with a special\r\nleaning towards magical rites, which came to be attached to the\r\nSamaveda. Closely related to, and probably later than this work, is\r\nthe Karma-pradipa (\"lamp of rites\"), also variously called sama-grihya-\r\nor chhandogyagrihya-pariçishta, chhandoga-pariçishta, Gobhila-smriti,\r\nattributed to the Katyayana of the White Yajurveda or to Gobhila. It\r\ndeals with the same subjects, though independently, as the Grihya\r\nsamgraha, with which it occasionally agrees in whole çlokas.\r\n\r\nOf great importance for the understanding of the sacrificial ceremonial\r\nare the Prayogas (\"Manuals\") and Paddhatis (\"Guides\"), of which\r\na vast number exist in manuscript. These works represent both the\r\nÇrauta and the Grihya ritual according to the various schools. The\r\nPrayogas describe the course of each sacrifice and the functions\r\nof the different groups of priests, solely from the point of view\r\nof practical performance, while the Paddhatis rather follow the\r\nsystematic accounts of the Sutras and sketch their contents. There\r\nare also versified accounts of the ritual called Karikas, which\r\nare directly attached to Sutras or to Paddhatis. The oldest of them\r\nappears to be the Karika of Kumarila (c. 700 A.D.).\r\n\r\nOf a supplementary character are also the class of writings called\r\nAnukramanis or Vedic Indices, which give lists of the hymns, the\r\nauthors, the metres, and the deities in the order in which they\r\noccur in the various Samhitas. To the Rigveda belonged seven of these\r\nworks, all attributed to Çaunaka, and composed in the mixture of the\r\nçloka and trishtubh metre, which is also found in Çaunaka's Rigveda\r\nPratiçakhya. There is also a General Index or Sarvanukramani which is\r\nattributed to Katyayana, and epitomises in the Sutra style the contents\r\nof the metrical indices. Of the metrical indices five have been\r\npreserved. The Arshanukramani, containing rather less than 300 çlokas,\r\ngives a list of the Rishis or authors of the Rigveda. Its present text\r\nrepresents a modernised form of that which was known to the commentator\r\nShadguruçishya in the twelfth century. The Chhandonukramani, which\r\nis of almost exactly the same length, enumerates the metres in which\r\nthe hymns of the Rigveda are composed. It also states for each book\r\nthe number of verses in each metre as well as the aggregate in all\r\nmetres. The Anuvakanukramani is a short index containing only about\r\nforty verses. It states the initial words of each of the eighty-five\r\nanuvakas or lessons into which the Rigveda is divided, and the\r\nnumber of hymns contained in these anuvakas. It further states that\r\nthe Rigveda contains 1017 hymns (or 1025 according to the Vashkala\r\nrecension), 10,580-1/2 verses, 153,826 words, 432,000 syllables,\r\nbesides some other statistical details. The number of verses given does\r\nnot exactly tally with various calculations that have recently been\r\nmade, but the differences are only slight, and may be due to the way in\r\nwhich certain repeated verses were counted by the author of the index.\r\n\r\nThere is another short index, known as yet only in two MSS., called\r\nthe Padanukramani, or \"index of lines\" (padas), and composed in the\r\nsame mixed metre as the others. The Suktanukramani, which has not\r\nsurvived, and is only known by name, probably consisted only of the\r\ninitial words (pratikas) of the hymns. It probably perished because the\r\nSarvanukramani would have rendered such a work superfluous. No MS. of\r\nthe Devatanukramani or \"Index of gods\" exists, but ten quotations from\r\nit have been preserved by the commentator Shadguruçishya. It must have\r\nbeen superseded by the Brihaddevata, an index of the \"many gods,\"\r\na much more extensive work than any of the other Anukramanis, as it\r\ncontains about 1200 çlokas interspersed with occasional trishtubhs. It\r\nis divided into eight adhyayas corresponding to the ashtakas of\r\nthe Rigveda. Following the order of the Rigveda, its main object\r\nis to state the deity for each verse. But as it contains a large\r\nnumber of illustrative myths and legends, it is of great value as an\r\nearly collection of stories. It is to a considerable extent based\r\non Yaska's Nirukta. Besides Yaska himself and other teachers named\r\nby that scholar, it also mentions Bhaguri and Açvalayana as well as\r\nthe Nidana Sutra, A peculiarity of this work is that it refers to a\r\nnumber of supplementary hymns (khilas) which do not form part of the\r\ncanonical text of the Rigveda.\r\n\r\nLater, at least, than the original form of these metrical Anukramanis,\r\nis the Sarvanukramani of Katyayana, which combines the data contained\r\nin them within the compass of a single work. Composed in the Sutra\r\nstyle, it is of considerable length, occupying about forty-six pages\r\nin the printed edition. For every hymn in the Rigveda it states\r\nthe initial word or words, the number of its verses, as well as the\r\nauthor, the deity, and the metre, even for single verses. There is an\r\nintroduction in twelve sections, nine of which form a short treatise on\r\nVedic metres corresponding to the last three sections of the Rigveda\r\nPratiçakhya. The author begins with the statement that he is going to\r\nsupply an index of the pratikas and so forth of the Rigveda according\r\nto the authorities (yathopadeçam), because without such knowledge the\r\nÇrauta and Smarta rites cannot be accomplished. These authorities are\r\ndoubtless the metrical indices described above. For the text of the\r\nSarvanukramani, which is composed in a concise Sutra style, not only\r\ncontains some metrical lines (padas), but also a number of passages\r\neither directly taken from the Arshanukramani and the Brihaddevata,\r\nor with their metrical wording but slightly altered. Another metrical\r\nwork attributed to Çaunaka is the Rigvidhana, which describes the\r\nmagical effects produced by the recitation of hymns or single verses\r\nof the Rigveda.\r\n\r\nTo the Pariçishtas of the Samaveda belong the two indices called Arsha\r\nand Daivata, enumerating respectively the Rishis and deities of the\r\ntext of the Naigeya branch of the Samaveda. They quote Yaska, Çaunaka,\r\nand Açvalayana among others. There are also two Anukramanis attached\r\nto the Black Yajurveda. That of the Atreya school consists of two\r\nparts, the first of which is in prose, and the second in çlokas. It\r\ncontains little more than an enumeration of names referring to the\r\ncontents of its Samhita. The Anukramani of the Charayaniya school of\r\nthe Kathaka is an index of the authors of the various sections and\r\nverses. Its statements regarding passages derived from the Rigveda\r\ndiffer much from those of the Sarvanukramani of the Rigveda, giving\r\na number of totally new names. It claims to be the work of Atri, who\r\ncommunicated it to Laugakshi. The Anukramani of the White Yajurveda\r\nin the Madhyamdina recension, attributed to Katyayana, consists of\r\nfive sections. The first four are an index of authors, deities, and\r\nmetres. The authors of verses taken from the Rigveda generally agree\r\nwith those in the Sarvanukramani. There are, however, a good many\r\nexceptions, several new names belonging to a later period, some even\r\nto that of the Çatapatha Brahmana. The fifth section gives a summary\r\naccount of the metres occurring in the text. It is identical with\r\nthe corresponding portion of the introduction to the Sarvanukramani,\r\nwhich was probably the original position of the section. There\r\nare many other Pariçishtas of the White Yajurveda, all attributed\r\nto Katyayana. Only three of these need be mentioned here. The\r\nNigama-pariçishta, a glossary of synonymous words occurring in the\r\nWhite Yajurveda, has a lexicographical interest. The Pravaradhyaya,\r\nor \"Chapter on Ancestors,\" is a list of Brahman families drawn up for\r\nthe purpose of determining the forbidden degrees of relationship in\r\nmarriage, and of indicating the priests suitable for the performance\r\nof sacrifice. The Charana-vyuha, or \"Exposition of the Schools\"\r\nof the various Vedas, is a very late work of little importance,\r\ngiving a far less complete enumeration of the Vedic schools than\r\ncertain sections of the Vishnu- and the Vayu-Purana. There is also a\r\nCharana-vyuha among the Pariçishtas of the Atharva-veda, which number\r\nupwards of seventy. This work makes the statement that the Atharva\r\ncontains 2000 hymns and 12,380 verses.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this account of Vedic literature, I cannot omit to say\r\na few words about Sayana, the great mediæval Vedic scholar, to whom\r\nor to whose initiation we owe a number of valuable commentaries on the\r\nRigveda, the Aitareya Brahmana and Aranyaka, as well as the Taittiriya\r\nSamhita, Brahmana, and Aranyaka, besides a number of other works. His\r\ncomments on the two Samhitas would appear to have been only partially\r\ncomposed by himself and to have been completed by his pupils. He died\r\nin 1387, having written his works under Bukka I. (1350-79), whose\r\nteacher and minister he calls himself, and his successor, Harihara\r\n(1379-99). These princes belonged to a family which, throwing off\r\nthe Muhammadan yoke in the earlier half of the fourteenth century,\r\nfounded the dynasty of Vijayanagara (\"city of victory\"), now Hampi,\r\non the Tungabhadra, in the Bellary district. Sayana's elder brother,\r\nMadhava, was minister of King Bukka, and died as abbot of the monastery\r\nof Çringeri, under the name of Vidyaranyasvamin. Not only did he too\r\nproduce works of his own, but Sayana's commentaries, as composed under\r\nhis patronage, were dedicated to him as madhaviya, or (\"influenced\r\nby Madhava\"). By an interesting coincidence Professor Max Müller's\r\nsecond edition of the Rigveda, with the commentary of Sayana, was\r\nbrought out under the auspices of a Maharaja of Vijayanagara. The\r\nlatter city has, however, nothing to do with that from which King\r\nBukka derived his title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE EPICS\r\n\r\n(Circa 500-50 B.C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn turning from the Vedic to the Sanskrit period, we are confronted\r\nwith a literature which is essentially different from that of\r\nthe earlier age in matter, spirit, and form. Vedic literature is\r\nessentially religious; Sanskrit literature, abundantly developed in\r\nevery other direction, is profane. But, doubtless as a result of the\r\nspeculative tendencies of the Upanishads, a moralising spirit at the\r\nsame time breathes through it as a whole. The religion itself which now\r\nprevails is very different from that of the Vedic age. For in the new\r\nperiod the three great gods, Brahma, Vishnu, and Çiva are the chief\r\nobjects of worship. The important deities of the Veda have sunk to a\r\nsubordinate position, though Indra is still relatively prominent as the\r\nchief of a warrior's heaven. Some new gods of lesser rank have arisen,\r\nsuch as Kubera, god of wealth; Ganeça, god of learning; Karttikeya,\r\ngod of war; Çri or Lakshmi, goddess of beauty and fortune; Durga or\r\nParvati, the terrible spouse of Çiva; besides the serpent deities\r\nand several classes of demigods and demons.\r\n\r\nWhile the spirit of Vedic literature, at least in its earlier phase,\r\nis optimistic, Sanskrit poetry is pervaded by Weltschmerz, resulting\r\nfrom the now universally accepted doctrine of transmigration. To\r\nthat doctrine, according to which beings pass by gradations from\r\nBrahma through men and animals to the lowest forms of existence,\r\nis doubtless also largely due the fantastic element characteristic\r\nof this later poetry. Here, for instance, we read of Vishnu coming\r\ndown to earth in the shape of animals, of sages and saints wandering\r\nbetween heaven and earth, of human kings visiting Indra in heaven.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with this fondness for introducing the marvellous and\r\nsupernatural into the description of human events goes a tendency to\r\nexaggeration. Thus King Viçvamitra, we are told, practised penance\r\nfor thousands of years in succession; and the power of asceticism\r\nis described as so great as to cause even the worlds and the gods to\r\ntremble. The very bulk of the Mahabharata, consisting as it does of\r\nmore than 200,000 lines, is a concrete illustration of this defective\r\nsense of proportion.\r\n\r\nAs regards the form in which it is presented to us, Sanskrit\r\nliterature contrasts with that of both the earlier and the later\r\nVedic period. While prose was employed in the Yajurvedas and the\r\nBrahmanas, and finally attained to a certain degree of development,\r\nit almost disappears in Sanskrit, nearly every branch of literature\r\nbeing treated in verse, often much to the detriment of the subject,\r\nas in the case of law. The only departments almost entirely restricted\r\nto the use of prose are grammar and philosophy, but the cramped and\r\nenigmatical style in which these subjects are treated hardly deserves\r\nthe name of prose at all. Literary prose is found only in fables,\r\nfairy tales, romances, and partially in the drama. In consequence of\r\nthis neglect, the prose of the later period compares unfavourably with\r\nthat of the Brahmanas. Even the style of the romances or prose kavyas,\r\nsubject as it is to the strict rules of poetics, is as clumsy as that\r\nof the grammatical commentaries; for the use of immense compounds,\r\nlike those of the Sutras, is one of its essential characteristics.\r\n\r\nSanskrit literature, then, resembles that of the earlier Vedic age in\r\nbeing almost entirely metrical. But the metres in which it is written,\r\nthough nearly all based on those of the Veda, are different. The bulk\r\nof the literature is composed in the çloka, a development of the Vedic\r\nanushtubh stanza of four octosyllabic lines; but while all four lines\r\nended iambically in the prototype, the first and third line have\r\nin the çloka acquired a trochaic rhythm. The numerous other metres\r\nemployed in the classical poetry have become much more elaborate\r\nthan their Vedic originals by having the quantity of every syllable\r\nin the line strictly determined.\r\n\r\nThe style, too, excepting the two old epics, is in Sanskrit poetry\r\nmade more artificial by the frequent use of long compounds, as well\r\nas by the application of the elaborate rules of poetics, while the\r\nlanguage is regulated by the grammar of Panini. Thus classical Sanskrit\r\nliterature, teeming as it does with fantastic and exaggerated ideas,\r\nwhile bound by the strictest rules of form, is like a tropical garden\r\nfull of luxuriant and rank growth, in which, however, many a fair\r\nflower of true poetry may be culled.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible even for the Sanskrit scholar who has not lived in\r\nIndia to appreciate fully the merits of this later poetry, much more so\r\nfor those who can only become acquainted with it in translations. For,\r\nin the first place, the metres, artificial and elaborate though they\r\nare, have a beauty of their own which cannot be reproduced in other\r\nlanguages. Again, to understand it thoroughly, the reader must have\r\nseen the tropical plains and forests of Hindustan steeped in intense\r\nsunshine or bathed in brilliant moonlight; he must have viewed the\r\nsilent ascetic seated at the foot of the sacred fig-tree; he must have\r\nexperienced the feelings inspired by the approach of the monsoon; he\r\nmust have watched beast and bird disporting themselves in tank and\r\nriver; he must know the varying aspects of Nature in the different\r\nseasons; in short, he must be acquainted with all the sights and sounds\r\nof an Indian landscape, the mere allusion to one of which may call\r\nup some familiar scene or touch some chord of sentiment. Otherwise,\r\nfor instance, the mango-tree, the red Açoka, the orange Kadamba, the\r\nvarious creepers, the different kinds of lotus, the mention of each\r\nof which should convey a vivid picture, are but empty names. Without\r\na knowledge, moreover, of the habits, modes of thought, and traditions\r\nof the people, much must remain meaningless. But those who are properly\r\nequipped can see many beauties in classical Sanskrit poetry which are\r\nentirely lost to others. Thus a distinguished scholar known to the\r\npresent writer has entered so fully into the spirit of that poetry,\r\nthat he is unable to derive pleasure from any other.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that Sanskrit literature came into\r\nbeing only at the close of the Vedic period, or that it merely forms\r\nits continuation and development. As a profane literature, it must,\r\nin its earliest phases, which are lost, have been contemporaneous\r\nwith the religious literature of the Vedas. Beside the productions\r\nof the latest Vedic period, that of the Upanishads and Sutras, there\r\ngrew up, on the one hand, the rich Pali literature of Buddhism, and,\r\non the other, the earliest form of Sanskrit poetry in the shape of\r\nepic tales. We have seen that even the Rigveda contains some hymns\r\nof a narrative character. Later we find in the Brahmanas a number\r\nof short legends, mostly in prose, but sometimes partly metrical,\r\nas the story of Çunahçepa in the Aitareya. Again, the Nirukta, which\r\nmust date from the fifth century B.C., contains many prose tales,\r\nand the oldest existing collection of Vedic legend, the metrical\r\nBrihaddevata, cannot belong to a much later time.\r\n\r\nSanskrit epic poetry falls into two main classes. That which\r\ncomprises old stories goes by the name of Itihasa, \"legend,\" Akhyana,\r\n\"narrative,\" or Purana, \"ancient tale,\" while the other is called\r\nKavya or artificial epic. The Mahabharata is the chief and oldest\r\nrepresentative of the former group, the Ramayana of the latter. Both\r\nthese great epics are composed in the same form of the çloka metre as\r\nthat employed in classical Sanskrit poetry. The Mahabharata, however,\r\nalso contains, as remnants of an older phase, archaic verses in the\r\nupajati and vamçastha (developments of the Vedic trishtubh and jagati)\r\nmetres, besides preserving some old prose stories in what is otherwise\r\nan entirely metrical work. It further differs from the sister epic in\r\nintroducing speeches with words, such as \"Brihadaçva spake,\" which\r\ndo not form part of the verse, and which may be survivals of prose\r\nnarrative connecting old epic songs. The Ramayana, again, is, in the\r\nmain, the work of a single poet, homogeneous in plan and execution,\r\ncomposed in the east of India. The Mahabharata, arising in the western\r\nhalf of the country, is a congeries of parts, the only unity about\r\nwhich is the connectedness of the epic cycle with which they deal; its\r\nepic kernel, moreover, which forms only about one-fifth of the whole\r\nwork, has become so overgrown with didactic matter, that in its final\r\nshape it is not an epic at all, but an encyclopædia of moral teaching.\r\n\r\nThe Mahabharata, which in its present form consists of over 100,000\r\nçlokas, equal to about eight times as much as the Iliad and Odyssey put\r\ntogether, is by far the longest poem known to literary history. It is\r\na conglomerate of epic and didactic matter divided into eighteen books\r\ncalled parvan, with a nineteenth, the Harivamça, as a supplement. The\r\nbooks vary very considerably in length, the twelfth being the longest,\r\nwith nearly 14,000, the seventeenth the shortest, with only 312\r\nçlokas. All the eighteen books, excepting the eighth and the last\r\nthree, are divided into subordinate parvans; each book is also cut\r\nup into chapters (adhyayas).\r\n\r\nNo European edition of the whole epic has yet been undertaken. This\r\nremains one of the great tasks reserved for the future of Sanskrit\r\nphilology, and can only be accomplished by the collaboration of several\r\nscholars. There are complete MSS. of the Mahabharata in London, Oxford,\r\nParis, and Berlin, besides many others in different parts of India;\r\nwhile the number of MSS. containing only parts of the poem can hardly\r\nbe counted.\r\n\r\nThree main editions of the epic have appeared in India. The editio\r\nprinceps, including the Harivamça, but without any commentary, was\r\npublished in four volumes at Calcutta in 1834-39. Another and better\r\nedition, which has subsequently been reproduced several times, was\r\nprinted at Bombay in 1863. This edition, though not including the\r\nsupplementary book, contains the commentary of Nilakantha. These\r\ntwo editions do not on the whole differ considerably. Being derived\r\nfrom a common source, they represent one and the same recension. The\r\nBombay edition, however, generally has the better readings. It contains\r\nabout 200 çlokas more than the Calcutta edition, but these additions\r\nare of no importance.\r\n\r\nA third edition, printed in Telugu characters, was published in four\r\nvolumes at Madras in 1855-60. It includes the Harivamça and extracts\r\nfrom Nilakantha's commentary. This edition represents a distinct\r\nSouth Indian recension, which seems to differ from that of the North\r\nabout as much as the three recensions of the Ramayana do from one\r\nanother. Both recensions are of about equal length, omissions in the\r\nfirst being compensated by others in the second. Sometimes one has\r\nthe better text, sometimes the other.\r\n\r\nThe epic kernel of the Mahabharata or the \"Great Battle of the\r\ndescendants of Bharata,\" consisting of about 20,000 çlokas, describes\r\nthe eighteen days' fight between Duryodhana, leader of the Kurus, and\r\nYudhishthira, chief of the Pandus, who were cousins, both descended\r\nfrom King Bharata, son of Çakuntala. Within this narrative frame has\r\ncome to be included a vast number of old legends about gods, kings, and\r\nsages; accounts of cosmogony and theogony; disquisitions on philosophy,\r\nlaw, religion, and the duties of the military caste. These lengthy\r\nand heterogeneous interpolations render it very difficult to follow\r\nthe thread of the narrative. Entire works are sometimes inserted to\r\nillustrate a particular statement. Thus, while the two armies are\r\ndrawn up prepared for battle, a whole philosophical poem, in eighteen\r\ncantos, the Bhagavadgita is recited to the hero Arjuna, who hesitates\r\nto advance and fight against his kin. Hence the Mahabharata claims\r\nto be not only a heroic poem (kavya), but a compendium teaching,\r\nin accordance with the Veda, the fourfold end of human existence\r\n(spiritual merit, wealth, pleasure, and salvation), a smriti or work\r\nof sacred tradition, which expounds the whole duty of man, and is\r\nintended for the religious instruction of all Hindus. Thus, in one\r\n(I. lxii. 35) of many similar passages, it makes the statement\r\nabout itself that \"this collection of all sacred texts, in which\r\nthe greatness of cows and Brahmans is exalted, must be listened\r\nto by virtuous-minded men.\" Its title, Karshna Veda, or \"Veda of\r\nKrishna\" (a form of Vishnu), the occurrence of a famous invocation\r\nof Narayana and Nara (names of Vishnu) and Sarasvati (Vishnu's wife)\r\nat the beginning of each of its larger sections, and the prevalence\r\nof Vishnuite doctrines throughout the work, prove it to have been a\r\nsmriti of the ancient Vishnuite sect of the Bhagavatas.\r\n\r\nThus it is clear that the Mahabharata in its present shape contains\r\nan epic nucleus, that it favours the worship of Vishnu, and that it\r\nhas become a comprehensive didactic work. We further find in Book\r\nI. the direct statements that the poem at one time contained 24,000\r\nçlokas before the episodes (upakhyana) were added, that it originally\r\nconsisted of only 8800 çlokas, and that it has three beginnings. These\r\ndata render it probable that the epic underwent three stages of\r\ndevelopment from the time it first assumed definite shape; and this\r\nconclusion is corroborated by various internal and external arguments.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the original kernel of the epic has as a\r\nhistorical background an ancient conflict between the two neighbouring\r\ntribes of the Kurus and Panchalas, who finally coalesced into a single\r\npeople. In the Yajurvedas these two tribes already appear united,\r\nand in the Kathaka King Dhritarashtra Vaichitravirya, one of the chief\r\nfigures of the Mahabharata, is mentioned as a well-known person. Hence\r\nthe historical germ of the great epic is to be traced to a very early\r\nperiod, which cannot well be later than the tenth century B.C. Old\r\nsongs about the ancient feud and the heroes who played a part in it,\r\nmust have been handed down by word of mouth and recited in popular\r\nassemblies or at great public sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThese disconnected battle-songs were, we must assume, worked up by some\r\npoetic genius into a comparatively short epic, describing the tragic\r\nfate of the Kuru race, who, with justice and virtue on their side,\r\nperished through the treachery of the victorious sons of Pandu, with\r\nKrishna at their head. To the period of this original epic doubtless\r\nbelong the traces the Mahabharata has preserved unchanged of the\r\nheroic spirit and the customs of ancient times, so different from the\r\nlater state of things which the Mahabharata as a whole reflects. To\r\nthis period also belongs the figure of Brahma as the highest god. The\r\nevidence of Pali literature shows that Brahma already occupied that\r\nposition in Buddha's time. We may, then, perhaps assume that the\r\noriginal form of our epic came into being about the fifth century\r\nB.C. The oldest evidence we have for the existence of the Mahabharata\r\nin some shape or other is to be found in Açvalayana's Grihya Sutra,\r\nwhere a Bharata and Mahabharata are mentioned. This would also point\r\nto about the fifth century B.C.\r\n\r\nTo the next stage, in which the epic, handed down by rhapsodists,\r\nswelled to a length of about 20,000 çlokas, belongs the representation\r\nof the victorious Pandus in a favourable light, and the introduction on\r\na level with Brahma of the two other great gods, Çiva, and especially\r\nVishnu, of whom Krishna appears as an incarnation.\r\n\r\nWe gather from the account of Megasthenes that about 300 B.C.,\r\nthese two gods were already prominent, and the people were divided\r\ninto Çivaites and Vishnuites. Moreover, the Yavanas or Greeks are\r\nmentioned in the Mahabharata as allies of the Kurus, and even the Çakas\r\n(Scythians) and Pahlavas (Parthians) are named along with them; Hindu\r\ntemples are also referred to as well as Buddhist relic mounds. Thus\r\nan extension of the original epic must have taken place after 300\r\nB.C. and by the beginning of our era.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmans knew how to utilise the great influence of the old epic\r\ntradition by gradually incorporating didactic matter calculated to\r\nimpress upon the people, and especially on kings, the doctrines\r\nof the priestly caste. It thus at last assumed the character of\r\na vast treatise on duty (dharma), in which the divine origin and\r\nimmutability of Brahman institutions, the eternity of the caste system,\r\nand the subordination of all to the priests, are laid down. When the\r\nMahabharata attributes its origin to Vyasa, it implies a belief in a\r\nfinal redaction, for the name simply means \"Arranger.\" Dahlmann has\r\nrecently put forward the theory that the great epic was a didactic\r\nwork from the very outset; this view, however, appears to be quite\r\nirreconcilable with the data of the poem, and is not likely to find\r\nany support among scholars.\r\n\r\nWhat evidence have we as to when the Mahabharata attained to the form\r\nin which we possess it? There is an inscription in a land grant dating\r\nfrom 462 A.D. or at the latest 532 A.D., which proves incontrovertibly\r\nthat the epic about 500 A.D. was practically of exactly the same length\r\nas it is stated to have in the survey of contents (anukramanika) given\r\nin Book I., and as it actually has now; for it contains the following\r\nwords: \"It has been declared in the Mahabharata, the compilation\r\nembracing 100,000 verses, by the highest sage, Vyasa, the Vyasa of\r\nthe Vedas, the son of Paraçara.\" This quotation at the same time\r\nproves that the epic at that date included the very long 12th and\r\n13th, as well as the extensive supplementary book, the Harivamça,\r\nwithout any one of which it would have been impossible to speak even\r\napproximately of 100,000 verses. There are also several land grants,\r\ndated between 450 and 500 A.D., and found in various parts of India,\r\nwhich quote the Mahabharata as an authority teaching the rewards of\r\npious donors and the punishments of impious despoilers. This shows\r\nthat in the middle of the fifth century it already possessed the\r\nsame character as at present, that of a Smriti or Dharmaçastra. It\r\nis only reasonable to suppose that it had acquired this character\r\nat least a century earlier, or by about 350 A.D. Further research\r\nin the writings of the Northern Buddhists and their dated Chinese\r\ntranslations will probably enable us to put this date back by some\r\ncenturies. We are already justified in considering it likely that\r\nthe great epic had become a didactic compendium before the beginning\r\nof our era. In any case, the present state of our knowledge entirely\r\ndisproves the suggestions put forward by Prof. Holtzmann in his work\r\non the Mahabharata, that the epic was turned into a Dharmaçastra by\r\nthe Brahmans after 900 A.D., and that whole books were added at this\r\nlate period.\r\n\r\nThe literary evidence of Sanskrit authors from about 600 to 1100\r\nA.D. supplies us with a considerable amount of information as to the\r\nstate of the great epic during those five centuries. An examination\r\nof the works of Bana, and of his predecessor Subandhu, shows that\r\nthese authors, who belong to the beginning of the seventh century,\r\nnot only studied and made use of legends from every one of the\r\neighteen books of the Mahabharata for the poetical embellishment of\r\ntheir works, but were even acquainted with the Harivamça. We also\r\nknow that in Bana's time the Bhagavadgita was included in the great\r\nepic. The same writer mentions that the Mahabharata was recited in\r\nthe temple of Mahakala at Ujjain. That such recitation was already a\r\nwidespread practice at that time is corroborated by an inscription\r\nof about 600 A.D. from the remote Indian colony of Kamboja, which\r\nstates that copies of the Mahabharata, as well as of the Ramayana\r\nand of an unnamed Purana, were presented to a temple there, and that\r\nthe donor had made arrangements to ensure their daily recitation in\r\nperpetuity. This evidence shows that the Mahabharata cannot have\r\nbeen a mere heroic poem, but must have borne the character of a\r\nSmriti work of long-established authority. Even at the present day\r\nboth public and private recitations of the Epics and Puranas are\r\ncommon in India, and are always instituted for the edification and\r\nreligious instruction of worshippers in temples or of members of\r\nthe family. As a rule, the Sanskrit texts are not only declaimed,\r\nbut also explained in the vernacular tongue for the benefit both of\r\nwomen, and of such males as belong to classes unacquainted with the\r\nlearned language of the Brahmans.\r\n\r\nWe next come to the eminent Mimamsa philosopher Kumarila, who has\r\nbeen proved to have flourished in the first half of the eighth\r\ncentury A.D. In the small portion of his great commentary, entitled\r\nTantra-varttika, which has been examined, no fewer than ten of the\r\neighteen books of the Mahabharata are named, quoted, or referred to. It\r\nis clear that the epic as known to him not only included the first book\r\n(adiparvan), but that that book in his time closely resembled the form\r\nof its text which we possess. It even appears to have contained the\r\nfirst section, called anukramanika or \"Survey of contents,\" and the\r\nsecond, entitled parva-samgraha or \"Synopsis of sections.\" Kumarila\r\nalso knew Books XII. and XIII., which have frequently been pronounced\r\nto be of late origin, as well as XIX. It is evident from his treatment\r\nof the epic that he regarded it as a work of sacred tradition and of\r\ngreat antiquity, intended from the beginning for the instruction of all\r\nthe four castes. To him it is not an account of the great war between\r\nthe Kauravas and Pandus; the descriptions of battles were only used\r\nfor the purpose of rousing the martial instincts of the warrior caste.\r\n\r\nThe great Vedantist philosopher Çankaracharya, who wrote his\r\ncommentary in 804 A.D., often quotes the Mahabharata as a Smriti,\r\nand in discussing a verse from Book XII. expressly states that the\r\nMahabharata was intended for the religious instruction of those\r\nclasses who by their position are debarred from studying the Vedas\r\nand the Vedanta.\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the eleventh century A.D. we have the oldest\r\nknown abstract of the Mahabharata, the work of the Kashmirian poet\r\nKshemendra, entitled Bharata-Manjari. This condensation is specially\r\nimportant, because it enables the scholar to determine the state of the\r\ntext in detail at that time. Professor Bühler's careful comparison of\r\nthe MSS. of this work with the great epic has led him to the conclusion\r\nthat Kshemendra's original did not differ from the Mahabharata as we\r\nhave it at present in any other way than two classes of MSS. differ\r\nfrom each other. This poetical epitome shows several omissions,\r\nbut these are on the whole of such a nature as is to be expected in\r\nany similar abridgment. It is, however, likely that twelve chapters\r\n(342-353) of Book XII., treating of Narayana, which the abbreviator\r\npasses over, did not exist in the original known to him. There can,\r\nmoreover, be no doubt that the forms of several proper names found in\r\nthe Manjari are better and older than those given by the editions of\r\nthe Mahabharata. Though the division of the original into eighteen\r\nbooks is found in the abridgment also, it is made up by turning the\r\nthird section (gada-parvan) of Book IX. (çalya-parvan) into a separate\r\nbook, while combining Books XII. and XIII. into a single one. This\r\nvariation probably represents an old division, as it occurs in many\r\nMSS. of the Mahabharata.\r\n\r\nAnother work of importance in determining the state of the Mahabharata\r\nis a Javanese translation of the epic, also dating from the eleventh\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe best-known commentator of the Mahabharata is Nilakantha, who\r\nlived at Kurpara, to the west of the Godavari, in Maharashtra, and,\r\naccording to Burnell, belongs to the sixteenth century. Older than\r\nNilakantha, who quotes him, is Arjuna Miçra, whose commentary, along\r\nwith that of Nilakantha, appears in an edition of the Mahabharata\r\nbegun at Calcutta in 1875. The earliest extant commentator of the\r\ngreat epic is Sarvajna Narayana, large fragments of whose notes have\r\nbeen preserved, and who cannot have written later than in the second\r\nhalf of the fourteenth century, but may be somewhat older.\r\n\r\nThe main story of the Mahabharata in the briefest possible outline\r\nis as follows: In the country of the Bharatas, which, from the name\r\nof the ruling race, had come to be called Kurukshetra, or \"Land of\r\nthe Kurus,\" there lived at Hastinapura, fifty-seven miles north-east\r\nof the modern Delhi, two princes named Dhritarashtra and Pandu. The\r\nelder of these brothers being blind, Pandu succeeded to the throne\r\nand reigned gloriously. He had five sons called Pandavas, the chief\r\nof whom were Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna. Dhritarashtra had a\r\nhundred sons, usually called Kauravas, or Kuru princes, the most\r\nprominent of whom was Duryodhana. On the premature death of Pandu,\r\nDhritarashtra took over the reins of government, and receiving his five\r\nnephews into his palace, had them brought up with his own sons. As the\r\nPandus distinguished themselves greatly in feats of arms and helped\r\nhim to victory, the king appointed his eldest nephew, Yudhishthira,\r\nto be heir-apparent. The Pandu princes, however, soon found it\r\nnecessary to escape from the plots their cousins now began to set\r\non foot against them. They made their way to the king of Panchala,\r\nwhose daughter Draupadi was won, in a contest between many kings and\r\nheroes, by Arjuna, who alone was able to bend the king's great bow and\r\nto hit a certain mark. In order to avoid strife, Draupadi consented to\r\nbecome the common wife of the five princes. At Draupadi's svayamvara\r\n(public choice of a husband) the Pandus made acquaintance with Krishna,\r\nthe hero of the Yadavas, who from this time onward became their fast\r\nfriend and adviser. Dhritarashtra, thinking it best to conciliate\r\nthe Pandavas in view of their double alliance with the Panchalas and\r\nYadavas, now divided his kingdom, giving Hastinapura to his sons, and\r\nto his nephews a district where they built the city of Indraprastha,\r\nthe modern Delhi (i.).\r\n\r\nHere the Pandavas ruled wisely and prospered greatly. Duryodhana's\r\njealousy being aroused, he resolved to ruin his cousins, with\r\nthe aid of his uncle Çakuni, a skilful gamester. Dhritarashtra\r\nwas accordingly induced to invite the Pandus to Hastinapura. Here\r\nYudhishthira, accepting the challenge to play at dice with Duryodhana,\r\nlost everything, his kingdom, his wealth, his army, his brothers,\r\nand finally Draupadi. In the end a compromise was made by which the\r\nPandavas agreed to go into banishment for twelve years, and to remain\r\nincognito for a thirteenth, after which they might return and regain\r\ntheir kingdom (ii.).\r\n\r\nWith Draupadi they accordingly departed to the Kamyaka forest on\r\nthe Sarasvati. The account of their twelve years' life here, and\r\nthe many legends told to console them in their exile, constitute the\r\nvana-parvan or \"Forest book,\" one of the longest in the poem (iii.).\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth year they spent in disguise as servants of Virata, king\r\nof the Matsyas. At this time the Kurus, in alliance with another king,\r\ninvaded the country of the Matsyas, causing much distress. Then the\r\nPandus arose, put the enemy to flight, and restored the king. They\r\nnow made themselves known, and entered into an alliance with the king\r\n(iv.).\r\n\r\nTheir message demanding back their possessions receiving no answer,\r\nthey prepared for war. The rival armies met in the sacred region\r\nof Kurukshetra, with numerous allies on both sides. Joined with the\r\nKurus were, among others, the people of Kosala, Videha, Anga, Banga\r\n(Bengal), Kalinga on the east, and those of Sindhu, Gandhara, Bahlika\r\n(Balk), together with the Çakas and Yavanas on the west. The Pandus,\r\non the other hand, were aided by the Panchalas, the Matsyas, part\r\nof the Yadavas under Krishna, besides the kings of Kaçi (Benares),\r\nChedi, Magadha, and others (v.).\r\n\r\nThe battle raged for eighteen days, till all the Kurus were destroyed,\r\nand only the Pandavas and Krishna with his charioteer escaped\r\nalive. The account of it extends over five books (vi.-x.). Then\r\nfollows a description of the obsequies of the dead (xi.). In the\r\nnext two books, Bhima, the leader of the Kurus, on his deathbed,\r\ninstructs Yudhishthira for about 20,000 çlokas on the duties of kings\r\nand other topics.\r\n\r\nThe Pandus having been reconciled to the old king Dhritarashtra,\r\nYudhishthira was crowned king in Hastinapura, and instituted a great\r\nhorse-sacrifice (xiv.). Dhritarashtra having remained at Hastinapura\r\nfor fifteen years, at length retired, with his wife Gandhari, to the\r\njungle, where they perished in a forest conflagration (xv.). Among\r\nthe Yadavas, who had taken different sides in the great war, an\r\ninternecine conflict broke out, which resulted in the annihilation\r\nof this people. Krishna sadly withdrew to the wilderness, where he\r\nwas accidentally shot dead by a hunter (xvi.).\r\n\r\nThe Pandus themselves, at last weary of life, leaving the young prince\r\nParikshit, grandson of Arjuna, to rule over Hastinapura, retired to the\r\nforest, and dying as they wandered towards Meru, the mountain of the\r\ngods (xvii.), ascended to heaven with their faithful spouse (xviii.).\r\n\r\nHere the framework of the great epic, which begins at the commencement\r\nof the first book, comes to an end. King Parikshit having died of\r\nsnake-bite, his son Janamejaya instituted a great sacrifice to the\r\nserpents. At that sacrifice the epic was recited by Vaiçampayana, who\r\nhad learnt it from Vyasa. The latter, we are told, after arranging the\r\nfour Vedas, composed the Mahabharata, which treats of the excellence\r\nof the Pandus, the greatness of Krishna, and the wickedness of the\r\nsons of Dhritarashtra.\r\n\r\nThe supplementary book, the Harivamça, or \"Family of Vishnu,\" is\r\nconcerned only with Krishna. It contains more than 16,000 çlokas,\r\nand is divided into three sections. The first of these describes\r\nthe history of Krishna's ancestors down to the time of Vishnu's\r\nincarnation in him; the second gives an account of Krishna's exploits;\r\nthe third treats of the future corruptions of the Kali, or fourth\r\nage of the world.\r\n\r\nThe episodes of the Mahabharata are numerous and often very extensive,\r\nconstituting, as we have seen, about four-fifths of the whole\r\npoem. Many of them are interesting for various reasons, and some are\r\ndistinguished by considerable poetic beauty. One of them, the story of\r\nÇakuntala (occurring in Book I.), supplied Kalidasa with the subject\r\nof his famous play. Episodes are specially plentiful in Book III.,\r\nbeing related to while away the time of the exiled Pandus. Here is\r\nfound the Matsyopakhyana, or \"Episode of the fish,\" being the story of\r\nthe flood, narrated with more diffuseness than the simple story told\r\nin the Çatapatha Brahmana. The fish here declares itself to be Brahma,\r\nLord of creatures, and not yet Vishnu, as in the Bhagavata Purana. Manu\r\nno longer appears as the progenitor of mankind, but as a creator who\r\nproduces all beings and worlds anew by means of his ascetic power.\r\n\r\nAnother episode is the history of Rama, interesting in its relation to\r\nValmiki's Ramayana, which deals with the same subject at much greater\r\nlength. The myth of the descent of the Ganges from heaven to earth,\r\nhere narrated, is told in the Ramayana also.\r\n\r\nAnother legend is that of the sage Riçya-çringa, who having produced\r\nrain in the country of Lomapada, king of the Angas, was rewarded with\r\nthe hand of the princess Çanta, and performed that sacrifice for\r\nKing Daçaratha which brought about the birth of Rama. This episode\r\nis peculiarly important from a critical point of view, as the legend\r\nrecurs not only in the Ramayana, but also in the Padma Purana, the\r\nSkanda Purana, and a number of other sources.\r\n\r\nOf special interest is the story of King Uçinara, son of Çibi,\r\nwho sacrificed his life to save a pigeon from a hawk. It is told\r\nagain in another part of Book III. about Çibi himself, as well as in\r\nBook XIII. about Vrishadarbha, son of Çibi. Distinctly Buddhistic in\r\norigin and character, the story is famous in Pali as well as Sanskrit\r\nliterature, and spread beyond the limits of India.\r\n\r\nThe story of the abduction of Draupadi forms an episode of her life\r\nwhile she dwelt with the Pandus in the Kamyaka forest. Accidentally\r\nseen when alone by King Jayadratha of Sindhu, who was passing with a\r\ngreat army, and fell in love with her at first sight, she was forcibly\r\ncarried off, and only rescued after a terrible fight, in which the\r\nPandus annihilated Jayadratha's host.\r\n\r\nInteresting as an illustration of the mythological ideas of the\r\nage is the episode which describes the journey of Arjuna to Indra's\r\nheaven. Here we see the mighty warrior-god of the Vedas transformed\r\ninto a glorified king of later times, living a life of ease amid\r\nthe splendours of his celestial court, where the ear is lulled by\r\nstrains of music, while the eye is ravished by the graceful dancing\r\nand exquisite beauty of heavenly nymphs.\r\n\r\nIn the story of Savitri we have one of the finest of the many\r\nideal female characters which the older epic poetry of India has\r\ncreated. Savitri, daughter of Açvapati, king of Madra, chooses as\r\nher husband Satyavat, the handsome and noble son of a blind and\r\nexiled king, who dwells in a forest hermitage. Though warned by the\r\nsage Narada that the prince is fated to live but a single year, she\r\npersists in her choice, and after the wedding departs with her husband\r\nto his father's forest retreat. Here she lives happily till she begins\r\nto be tortured with anxiety on the approach of the fatal day. When\r\nit arrives, she follows her husband on his way to cut wood in the\r\nforest. After a time he lies down exhausted. Yama, the god of death,\r\nappears, and taking his soul, departs. As Savitri persistently follows\r\nhim, Yama grants her various boons, always excepting the life of her\r\nhusband; but yielding at last to her importunities, he restores the\r\nsoul to the lifeless body. Satyavat recovers, and lives happily for\r\nmany years with his faithful Savitri.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest and most beautiful stories inserted in the\r\nMahabharata is the Nalopakhyana, or \"Episode of Nala.\" It is one of the\r\nleast corrupted of the episodes, its great popularity having prevented\r\nthe transforming hand of an editor from introducing Çiva and Vishnu,\r\nor from effacing the simplicity of the manners it depicts--the prince,\r\nfor instance, cooks his own food--or from changing the character of\r\nIndra, and other old traits. The poem is pervaded by a high tone of\r\nmorality, manifested above all in the heroic devotion and fidelity\r\nof Damayanti, its leading character. It also contains many passages\r\ndistinguished by tender pathos.\r\n\r\nThe story is told by the wise Brihadaçva to the exiled Yudhishthira,\r\nin order to console him for the loss of the kingdom he has forfeited\r\nat play. Nala, prince of Nishada, chosen from among many competitors\r\nfor her hand by Damayanti, princess of Vidarbha, passes several\r\nyears of happy married life with her. Then, possessed by the demon\r\nKali, and indulging in gambling, he loses his kingdom and all his\r\npossessions. Wandering half naked in the forest with Damayanti, he\r\nabandons her in his frenzy. Very pathetic is the scene describing\r\nhow he repeatedly returns to the spot where his wife lies asleep on\r\nthe ground before he finally deserts her. Equally touching are the\r\naccounts of her terror on awaking to find herself alone in the forest,\r\nand of her lamentations as she roams in search of her husband, and\r\ncalls out to him--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Hero, valiant, knowing duty,\r\n      To honour faithful, lord of earth,\r\n        If thou art within this forest,\r\n      Then show thee in thy proper form.\r\n        Shall I hear the voice of Nala,\r\n      Sweet as the draught of Amrita,\r\n        With its deep and gentle accent,\r\n      Like rumble of the thunder-cloud,\r\n        Saying \"Daughter of Vidarbha!\"\r\n      To me with clear and blessed sound.\r\n        Rich, like Vedas murmured flowing,\r\n      At once destroying all my grief?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are graphic descriptions of the beauties and terrors of the\r\ntropical forest in which Damayanti wanders. At last she finds her\r\nway back to her father's court at Kundina Many and striking are the\r\nsimiles with which the poet dwells on the grief and wasted form of\r\nthe princess in her separation from her husband. She is\r\n\r\n\r\n        Like the young moon's slender crescent\r\n      Obscured by black clouds in the sky;\r\n        Like the lotus-flower uprooted,\r\n      All parched and withered by the sun;\r\n        Like the pallid night, when Rahu\r\n      Has swallowed up the darkened moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nNala, meanwhile, transformed into a dwarf, has become charioteer to\r\nthe king of Oudh. Damayanti at last hears news leading her to suspect\r\nher husband's whereabouts. She accordingly holds out hopes of her\r\nhand to the king of Oudh, on condition of his driving the distance of\r\n500 miles to Kundina in a single day. Nala, acting as his charioteer,\r\naccomplishes the feat, and is rewarded by the king with the secret of\r\nthe highest skill in dicing. Recognised by his wife in spite of his\r\ndisguise, he regains his true form. He plays again, and wins back his\r\nlost kingdom. Thus after years of adventure, sorrow, and humiliation\r\nhe is at last reunited with Damayanti, with whom he spends the rest\r\nof his days in happiness.\r\n\r\nThough several supernatural and miraculous features like those which\r\noccur in fairy tales are found in the episode of Nala, they are not\r\nsufficient to mar the spirit of true poetry which pervades the story\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PURANAS.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the Mahabharata is a distinct class of eighteen\r\nepic works, didactic in character and sectarian in purpose, going by\r\nthe name of Purana. The term purana is already found in the Brahmanas\r\ndesignating cosmogonic inquiries generally. It is also used in the\r\nMahabharata somewhat vaguely to express \"ancient legendary lore,\"\r\nimplying didactic as well as narrative matter, and pointing to an\r\nold collection of epic stories. One passage of the epic (I. v. 1)\r\ndescribes purana as containing stories of the gods and genealogies of\r\nthe sages. In Book XVIII., as well as in the Harivamça, mention is even\r\nmade of eighteen Puranas, which, however, have not been preserved; for\r\nthose known to us are all, on the whole, later than the Mahabharata,\r\nand for the most part derive their legends of ancient days from the\r\ngreat epic itself. Nevertheless they contain much that is old; and it\r\nis not always possible to assume that the passages they have in common\r\nwith the Mahabharata and Manu have been borrowed from those works. They\r\nare connected by many threads with the old law-books (smritis) and\r\nthe Vedas, representing probably a development of older works of\r\nthe same class. In that part of their contents which is peculiar to\r\nthem, the Puranas agree so closely, being often verbally identical\r\nfor pages, that they must be derived from some older collection as\r\na common source. Most of them are introduced in exactly the same\r\nway as the Mahabharata, Ugraçravas, the son of Lomaharshana, being\r\nrepresented as relating their contents to Çaunaka on the occasion\r\nof a sacrifice in the Naimisha forest. The object of most of these\r\nlegendary compilations is to recommend the sectarian cult of Vishnu,\r\nthough some of them favour the worship of Çiva.\r\n\r\nBesides cosmogony, they deal with mythical descriptions of the earth,\r\nthe doctrine of the cosmic ages, the exploits of ancient gods, saints,\r\nand heroes, accounts of the Avatars of Vishnu, the genealogies of the\r\nSolar and Lunar race of kings, and enumerations of the thousand names\r\nof Vishnu or of Çiva. They also contain rules about the worship of\r\nthe gods by means of prayers, fastings, votive offerings, festivals,\r\nand pilgrimages.\r\n\r\nThe Garuda, as well as the late and unimportant Agni Purana,\r\npractically constitute abstracts of the Mahabharata and the Harivamça.\r\n\r\nThe Vayu, which appears to be one of the oldest, coincides in part of\r\nits matter with the Mahabharata, but is more closely connected with\r\nthe Harivamça, the passage which deals with the creation of the world\r\noften agreeing verbatim with the corresponding part of the latter poem.\r\n\r\nThe relationship of the Matsya Purana to the great epic and its\r\nsupplementary book as sources is similarly intimate. It is introduced\r\nwith the story of Manu and the Fish (Matsya). The Kurma, besides giving\r\nan account of the various Avatars of Vishnu (of which the tortoise or\r\nkurma is one), of the genealogies of gods and kings, as well as other\r\nmatters, contains an extensive account of the world in accordance with\r\nthe accepted cosmological notions of the Mahabharata and of the Puranas\r\nin general. The world is here represented as consisting of seven\r\nconcentric islands separated by different oceans. The central island,\r\nwith Mount Meru in the middle, is Jambu-dvipa, of which Bharata-varsha,\r\nthe \"kingdom of the Bharatas,\" or India, is the main division.\r\n\r\nThe Markandeya, which expressly recognises the priority of the\r\nMahabharata, is so called because it is related by the sage Markandeya\r\nto explain difficulties suggested by the epic, such as, How could\r\nKrishna become a man? Its leading feature is narrative and it is the\r\nleast sectarian of the Puranas.\r\n\r\nThe extensive Padma Purana, which contains a great many stones\r\nagreeing with those of the Mahabharata, is, on the other hand,\r\nstrongly Vishnuite in tone. Yet this, as well as the Markandeya,\r\nexpressly states the doctrine of the Tri-murti or Trinity, that Brahma,\r\nVishnu, and Çiva are only one being. This doctrine, already to be\r\nfound in the Harivamça, is not so prominent in post-Vedic literature\r\nas is commonly supposed. It is interesting to note that the story\r\nof Rama, as told in the Padma Purana, follows not only the Ramayana\r\nbut also Kalidasa's account in the Raghuvamça, with which it often\r\nagrees literally. Again, the story of Çakuntala is related, not in\r\naccordance with the Mahabharata, but with Kalidasa's drama.\r\n\r\nThe Brahma-vaivarta Purana is also strongly sectarian in favour of\r\nVishnu in the form of Krishna. It is to be noted that both here and\r\nin the Padma Purana an important part is played by Krishna's mistress\r\nRadha, who is unknown to the Harivamça, the Vishnu, and even the\r\nBhagavata Purana.\r\n\r\nThe Vishnu Purana, which very often agrees with the Mahabharata in\r\nits subject-matter, corresponds most closely to the Indian definition\r\nof a Purana, as treating of the five topics of primary creation,\r\nsecondary creation, genealogies of gods and patriarchs, reigns of\r\nvarious Manus, and the history of the old dynasties of kings.\r\n\r\nThe Bhagavata Purana, which consists of about 18,000 çlokas, derives\r\nits name from being dedicated to the glorification of Bhagavata or\r\nVishnu. It is later than the Vishnu, which it presupposes, probably\r\ndating from the thirteenth century. It exercises a more powerful\r\ninfluence in India than any other Purana. The most popular part is\r\nthe tenth book, which narrates in detail the history of Krishna,\r\nand has been translated into perhaps every one of the vernacular\r\nlanguages of India.\r\n\r\nOther Vishnuite Puranas of a late date are the Brahma, the Naradiya,\r\nthe Vamana, and the Varaha, the latter two called after the Dwarf\r\nand the Boar incarnations of Vishnu.\r\n\r\nThose which specially favour the cult of Çiva are the Skanda, the Çiva,\r\nthe Linga, and the Bhavishya or Bhavishyat Puranas. The latter two\r\ncontain little narrative matter, being rather ritual in character. A\r\nBhavishyat Purana is already mentioned in the Apastamba Dharma Sutra.\r\n\r\nBesides these eighteen Puranas there is also an equal number of\r\nsecondary works of the same class called Upa-puranas, in which the\r\nepic matter has become entirely subordinate to the ritual element.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAMAYANA.\r\n\r\nThough there is, as we shall see, good reason for supposing that\r\nthe original part of the Ramayana assumed shape at a time when the\r\nMahabharata was still in a state of flux, we have deferred describing\r\nit on account of its connection with the subsequent development of\r\nepic poetry in Sanskrit literature.\r\n\r\nIn its present form the Ramayana consists of about 24,000 çlokas,\r\nand is divided into seven books. It has been preserved in three\r\ndistinct recensions, the West Indian (A), the Bengal (B), and the\r\nBombay (C). About one-third of the çlokas in each recension occurs\r\nin neither of the other two. The Bombay recension has in most cases\r\npreserved the oldest form of the text; for, as the other two arose\r\nin the centres of classical Sanskrit literature, where the Gauda\r\nand the Vaidarbha styles of composition respectively flourished, the\r\nirregularities of the epic language have been removed in them. The\r\nRamayana was here treated as a regular kavya or artificial epic, a\r\nfate which the Mahabharata escaped because it early lost its original\r\ncharacter, and came to be regarded as a didactic work. These two later\r\nrecensions must not, however, be looked upon as mere revisions of the\r\nBombay text. The variations of all three are of such a kind that they\r\ncan for the most part be accounted for only by the fluctuations of oral\r\ntradition among the professional reciters of the epic, at the time\r\nwhen the three recensions assumed definite shape in different parts\r\nof the country by being committed to writing. After having been thus\r\nfixed, the fate of each of these recensions was of course similar to\r\nthat of any other text. They appear to go back to comparatively early\r\ntimes. For quotations from the Ramayana occurring in works that belong\r\nto the eighth and ninth centuries A.D. show that a recension allied to\r\nthe present C, and probably another allied to the present A, existed at\r\nthat period. Moreover, Kshemendra's poetical abstract of the epic, the\r\nRamayana-kathasara-manjari, which follows the contents of the original\r\nstep by step, proves that its author used A, and perhaps B also, in\r\nthe middle of the eleventh century. Bhoja, the composer of another\r\nepitome, the Ramayana-champu, probably used C in the same century.\r\n\r\nThe careful investigations of Professor Jacobi have shown that the\r\nRamayana originally consisted of five books only (ii.-vi.). The\r\nseventh is undoubtedly a later addition, for the conclusion of the\r\nsixth was evidently at one time the end of the whole poem. Again,\r\nthe first book has several passages which conflict with statements\r\nin the later books. It further contains two tables of contents (in\r\ncantos i. and iii.) which were clearly made at different times; for\r\none of them takes no notice of the first and last books, and must,\r\ntherefore, have been made before these were added. What was obviously\r\na part of the commencement of the original poem has been separated\r\nfrom its continuation at the opening of Book II., and now forms the\r\nbeginning of the fifth canto of Book I. Some cantos have also been\r\ninterpolated in the genuine books. As Professor Jacobi shows, all these\r\nadditions to the original body of the epic have been for the most part\r\nso loosely attached that the junctures are easy to recognise. They\r\nare, however, pervaded by the same spirit as the older part. There\r\nis, therefore, no reason for the supposition that they are due to a\r\nBrahman revision intended to transform a poem originally meant for\r\nthe warrior caste. They seem rather to owe their origin simply to the\r\ndesire of professional rhapsodists to meet the demands of the popular\r\ntaste. We are told in the Ramayana itself that the poem was either\r\nrecited by professional minstrels or sung to the accompaniment of\r\na stringed instrument, being handed down orally, in the first place\r\nby Rama's two sons Kuça and Lava. These names are nothing more than\r\nthe inventions of popular etymology meant to explain the Sanskrit\r\nword kuçilava, \"bard\" or \"actor.\" The new parts were incorporated\r\nbefore the three recensions which have come down to us arose, but\r\na considerable time must have elapsed between the composition of\r\nthe original poem and that of the additions. For the tribal hero of\r\nthe former has in the latter been transformed into a national hero,\r\nthe moral ideal of the people; and the human hero (like Krishna in the\r\nMahabharata) of the five genuine books (excepting a few interpolations)\r\nhas in the first and last become deified and identified with the god\r\nVishnu, his divine nature in these additions being always present to\r\nthe minds of their authors. Here, too, Valmiki, the composer of the\r\nRamayana, appears as a contemporary of Rama, and is already regarded\r\nas a seer. A long interval of time must have been necessary for such\r\ntransformations as these.\r\n\r\nAs to the place of its origin, there is good reason for believing that\r\nthe Ramayana arose in Kosala, the country ruled by the race of Ikshvaku\r\nin Ayodhya (Oudh). For we are told in the seventh book (canto 45)\r\nthat the hermitage of Valmiki lay on the south bank of the Ganges; the\r\npoet must further have been connected with the royal house of Ayodhya,\r\nas the banished Sita took refuge in his hermitage, where her twin\r\nsons were born, brought up, and later learnt the epic from his lips;\r\nand lastly, the statement is made in the first book (canto 5) that\r\nthe Ramayana arose in the family of the Ikshvakus. In Ayodhya, then,\r\nthere must have been current among the court bards (suta) a number\r\nof epic tales narrating the fortunes of the Ikshvaku hero Rama. Such\r\nlegends, we may assume, Valmiki worked up into a single homogeneous\r\nproduction, which, as the earliest epic of importance conforming\r\nto the rules of poetics, justly received the name of adi-kavya, or\r\n\"first artificial poem,\" from its author's successors. This work was\r\nthen learnt by professional rhapsodists (kuçilava) and recited by\r\nthem in public as they wandered about the country.\r\n\r\nThe original part of the Ramayana appears to have been completed\r\nat a time when the epic kernel of the Mahabharata had not as yet\r\nassumed definite shape. For while the heroes of the latter are not\r\nmentioned in the Ramayana, the story of Rama is often referred to in\r\nthe longer epic. Again, in a passage of Book VII. of the Mahabharata,\r\nwhich cannot be regarded as a later addition, two lines are quoted as\r\nValmiki's that occur unaltered in Book VI. of the Ramayana. The poem\r\nof Valmiki must, therefore, have been generally known as an old work\r\nbefore the Mahabharata assumed a coherent form. In Book III. (cantos\r\n277-291) of the latter epic, moreover, there is a Ramopakhyana or\r\n\"Episode of Rama,\" which seems to be based on the Ramayana as it\r\ncontains several verses agreeing more or less with Valmiki's lines,\r\nand its author presupposes on the part of his audience a knowledge\r\nof the Ramayana as represented by the Bombay recension.\r\n\r\nA further question of importance in determining the age of the\r\nRamayana is its relation to Buddhistic literature. Now, the story\r\nof Rama is found in a somewhat altered form in one of the Pali\r\nBirth-Stories, the Daçaratha Jataka. As this version confines itself\r\nto the first part of Rama's adventures, his sojourn in the forest,\r\nit might at first sight seem to be the older of the two. There is,\r\nhowever, at least an indication that the second part of the story,\r\nthe expedition to Lanka, was also known to the author of the Jataka;\r\nfor while Valmiki's poem concludes with the reunion of Rama and Sita,\r\nthe Jataka is made to end with the marriage of the couple after the\r\nmanner of fairy tales, there being at the same time traces that they\r\nwere wedded all along in the original source of the legend. Moreover,\r\na verse from the old part of the Ramayana (vi. 128) actually occurs\r\nin a Pali form embedded in the prose of this Jataka.\r\n\r\nIt might, indeed, be inferred from the greater freedom with which they\r\nhandle the çloka metre that the canonical Buddhistic writings are older\r\nthan the Ramayana, in which the çloka is of the classical Sanskrit\r\ntype. But, as a matter of fact, these Pali works on the whole observe\r\nthe laws of the classical çloka, their metrical irregularities being\r\nmost probably caused by the recent application of Pali to literary\r\npurposes as well as by the inferior preservation of Pali works. On the\r\nother hand, Buddhistic literature early made use of the Arya metre,\r\nwhich, though so popular in classical Sanskrit poetry, is not yet to\r\nbe found in the Sanskrit epics.\r\n\r\nThe only mention of Buddha in the Ramayana occurs in a passage which\r\nis evidently interpolated. Hence the balance of the evidence in\r\nrelation to Buddhism seems to favour the pre-Buddhistic origin of\r\nthe genuine Ramayana.\r\n\r\nThe question whether the Greeks were known to the author of our epic\r\nis, of course, also of chronological moment. An examination of the\r\npoem shows that the Yavanas (Greeks) are only mentioned twice, once\r\nin Book I. and once in a canto of Book IV., which Professor Jacobi\r\nshows to be an interpolation. The only conclusion to be drawn from\r\nthis is that the additions to the original poem were made some time\r\nafter 300 B.C. Professor Weber's assumption of Greek influence in the\r\nstory of the Ramayana seems to lack foundation. For the tale of the\r\nabduction of Sita and the expedition to Lanka for her recovery has\r\nno real correspondence with that of the rape of Helen and the Trojan\r\nwar. Nor is there any sufficient reason to suppose that the account\r\nof Rama bending a powerful bow in order to win Sita was borrowed from\r\nthe adventures of Ulysses. Stories of similar feats of strength for\r\na like object are to be found in the poetry of other nations besides\r\nthe Greeks, and could easily have arisen independently.\r\n\r\nThe political aspect of Eastern India as revealed by the Ramayana sheds\r\nsome additional light on the age of the epic. In the first place, no\r\nmention is made of the city of Pataliputra (Patna), which was founded\r\nby King Kalaçoka (under whom the second Buddhist council was held at\r\nVaiçali about 380 B.C.), and which by the time of Megasthenes (300\r\nB.C.) had become the capital of India. Yet Rama is in Book I. (canto\r\n35) described as passing the very spot where that city stood, and the\r\npoet makes a point (in cantos 32-33) of referring to the foundation of\r\na number of cities in Eastern Hindustan, such as Kauçambi, Kanyakubja,\r\nand Kampilya, in order to show how far the fame of the Ramayana spread\r\nbeyond the confines of Kosala, the land of its origin. Had Pataliputra\r\nexisted at the time, it could not have failed to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt is further a noteworthy fact that the capital of Kosala is in\r\nthe original Ramayana regularly called Ayodhya, while the Buddhists,\r\nJains, Greeks, and Patanjali always give it the name of Saketa. Now\r\nin the last book of the Ramayana we are told that Rama's son, Lava,\r\nfixed the seat of his government at Çravasti, a city not mentioned at\r\nall in the old part of the epic; and in Buddha's time King Prasenajit\r\nof Kosala is known to have reigned at Çravasti. All this points to the\r\nconclusion that the original Ramayana was composed when the ancient\r\nAyodhya had not yet been deserted, but was still the chief city of\r\nKosala, when its new name of Saketa was still unknown, and before\r\nthe seat of government was transferred to Çravasti.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the old part of Book I., Mithila and Viçala are spoken of\r\nas twin cities under separate rulers, while we know that by Buddha's\r\ntime they had coalesced to the famous city of Vaiçali, which was then\r\nruled by an oligarchy.\r\n\r\nThe political conditions described in the Ramayana indicate the\r\npatriarchal rule of kings possessing only a small territory, and never\r\npoint to the existence of more complex states; while the references of\r\nthe poets of the Mahabharata to the dominions in Eastern India ruled by\r\na powerful king, Jarasandha, and embracing many lands besides Magadha,\r\nreflect the political conditions of the fourth century B.C. The\r\ncumulative evidence of the above arguments makes it difficult to\r\navoid the conclusion that the kernel of the Ramayana was composed\r\nbefore 500 B.C., while the more recent portions were probably not\r\nadded till the second century B.C. and later.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion does not at first sight seem to be borne out by the\r\nlinguistic evidence of the Ramayana, For the epic (arsha) dialect of\r\nthe Bombay recension, which is practically the same as that of the\r\nMahabharata, both betrays a stage of development decidedly later than\r\nthat of Panini, and is taken no notice of by that grammarian. But it\r\nis, for all that, not necessarily later in date. For Panini deals only\r\nwith the refined Sanskrit of the cultured (çishta), that is to say,\r\nof the Brahmans, which would be more archaic than the popular dialect\r\nof wandering rhapsodists; and he would naturally have ignored the\r\nlatter. Now at the time of the Açoka inscriptions, or hardly more\r\nthan half a century later than Panini, Prakrit was the language of\r\nthe people in the part of India where the Ramayana was composed. It\r\nis, therefore, not at all likely that the Ramayana, which aimed at\r\npopularity, should have been composed as late as the time of Panini,\r\nwhen it could not have been generally understood. If the language of\r\nthe epic is later than Panini, it is difficult to see how it escaped\r\nthe dominating influence of his grammar. It is more likely that the\r\npopular Sanskrit of the epics received general currency at a much\r\nearlier date by the composition of a poem like that of Valmiki. A\r\nsearching comparative investigation of the classical Kavyas will\r\nprobably show that they are linguistically more closely connected\r\nwith the old epic poetry, and that they deviate more from the Paninean\r\nstandard than is usually supposed.\r\n\r\nIn style the Ramayana is already far removed from the naïve\r\npopular epic, in which the story is the chief thing, and not its\r\nform. Valmiki is rich in similes, which he often cumulates; he not\r\ninfrequently uses the cognate figure called rupaka or \"identification\"\r\n(e.g. \"foot-lotus\") with much skill, and also occasionally employs\r\nother ornaments familiar to the classical poets, besides approximating\r\nto them in the style of his descriptions. The Ramayana, in fact,\r\nrepresents the dawn of the later artificial poetry (kavya), which\r\nwas in all probability the direct continuation and development of the\r\nart handed down by the rhapsodists who recited Valmiki's work. Such\r\na relationship is distinctly recognised by the authors of the great\r\nclassical epics (mahakavis) when they refer to him as the adi-kavi or\r\n\"first poet.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the Ramayana, as narrated in the five genuine books,\r\nconsists of two distinct parts. The first describes the events at the\r\ncourt of King Daçaratha at Ayodhya and their consequences. Here we have\r\na purely human and natural account of the intrigues of a queen to set\r\nher son upon the throne. There is nothing fantastic in the narrative,\r\nnor has it any mythological background. If the epic ended with the\r\nreturn of Rama's brother, Bharata, to the capital, after the old king's\r\ndeath, it might pass for a historical saga. For Ikshvaku, Daçaratha,\r\nand Rama are the names of celebrated and mighty kings, mentioned even\r\nin the Rigveda, though not there connected with one another in any way.\r\n\r\nThe character of the second part is entirely different. Based on a\r\nfoundation of myths, it is full of the marvellous and fantastic. The\r\noldest theory as to the significance of the story was that of Lassen,\r\nwho held that it was intended to represent allegorically the first\r\nattempt of the Aryans to conquer the South. But Rama is nowhere\r\ndescribed as founding an Aryan realm in the Dekhan, nor is any\r\nsuch intention on his part indicated anywhere in the epic. Weber\r\nsubsequently expressed the same view in a somewhat modified\r\nform. According to him, the Ramayana was meant to account for the\r\nspread of Aryan culture to the South and to Ceylon. But this form of\r\nthe allegorical theory also lacks any confirmation from the statements\r\nof the epic itself; for Rama's expedition is nowhere represented\r\nas producing any change or improvement in the civilisation of the\r\nSouth. The poet knows nothing about the Dekhan beyond the fact that\r\nBrahman hermitages are to be found there. Otherwise it is a region\r\nhaunted by the monsters and fabulous beings with which an Indian\r\nimagination would people an unknown land.\r\n\r\nThere is much more probability in the opinion of Jacobi, that\r\nthe Ramayana contains no allegory at all, but is based on Indian\r\nmythology. The foundation of the second part would thus be a celestial\r\nmyth of the Veda transformed into a narrative of earthly adventures\r\naccording to a not uncommon development. Sita, can be traced to the\r\nRigveda, where she appears as the Furrow personified and invoked as a\r\ngoddess. In some of the Grihya Sutras she again appears as a genius\r\nof the ploughed field, is praised as a being of great beauty, and\r\nis accounted the wife of Indra or Parjanya, the rain-god. There are\r\ntraces of this origin in the Ramayana itself. For Sita is represented\r\n(i. 66) as having emerged from the earth when her father Janaka was\r\nonce ploughing, and at last she disappears underground in the arms\r\nof the goddess Earth (vii. 97). Her husband, Rama, would be no other\r\nthan Indra, and his conflict with Ravana, chief of the demons, would\r\nrepresent the Indra-Vritra myth of the Rigveda. This identification\r\nis confirmed by the name of Ravana's son being Indrajit, \"Conqueror\r\nof Indra,\" or Indraçatru, \"Foe of Indra,\" the latter being actually\r\nan epithet of Vritra in the Rigveda. Ravana's most notable feat, the\r\nrape of Sita, has its prototype in the stealing of the cows recovered\r\nby Indra. Hanumat, the chief of the monkeys and Rama's ally in the\r\nrecovery of Sita, is the son of the wind-god, with the patronymic\r\nMaruti, and is described as flying hundreds of leagues through the air\r\nto find Sita. Hence in his figure perhaps survives a reminiscence of\r\nIndra's alliance with the Maruts in his conflict with Vritra, and of\r\nthe dog Sarama, who, as Indra's messenger, crosses the waters of the\r\nRasa and tracks the cows. Sarama recurs as the name of a demoness who\r\nconsoles Sita in her captivity. The name of Hanumat being Sanskrit,\r\nthe character is probably not borrowed from the aborigines. As Hanumat\r\nis at the present day the tutelary deity of village settlements all\r\nover India, Prof. Jacobi's surmise that he must have been connected\r\nwith agriculture, and may have been a genius of the monsoon, has\r\nsome probability.\r\n\r\nThe main story of the Ramayana begins with an account of the city\r\nof Ayodhya under the rule of the mighty King Daçaratha, the sons of\r\nwhose three wives, Kauçalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra, are Rama, Bharata,\r\nand Lakshmana respectively. Rama is married to Sita, daughter of\r\nJanaka, king of Videha. Daçaratha, feeling the approach of old\r\nage, one day announces in a great assembly that he desires to make\r\nRama heir-apparent, an announcement received with general rejoicing\r\nbecause of Rama's great popularity. Kaikeyi, meanwhile, wishing her son\r\nBharata to succeed, reminds the king that he had once offered her the\r\nchoice of two boons, of which she had as yet not availed herself. When\r\nDaçaratha at last promises to fulfil whatever she may desire, Kaikeyi\r\nrequests him to appoint Bharata his successor, and to banish Rama\r\nfor fourteen years. The king, having in vain implored her to retract,\r\npasses a sleepless night. Next day, when the solemn consecration of\r\nRama is to take place, Daçaratha sends for his son and informs him\r\nof his fate. Rama receives the news calmly and prepares to obey his\r\nfather's command as his highest duty. Sita and Lakshmana resolve on\r\nsharing his fortunes, and accompany him in his exile. The aged king,\r\novercome with grief at parting from his son, withdraws from Kaikeyi,\r\nand passing the remainder of his days with Rama's mother, Kauçalya,\r\nfinally dies lamenting for his banished son. Rama has meanwhile\r\nlived peacefully and happily with Sita and his brother in the wild\r\nforest of Dandaka. On the death of the old king, Bharata, who in the\r\ninterval has lived with the parents of his mother, is summoned to the\r\nthrone. Refusing the succession with noble indignation, he sets out for\r\nthe forest in order to bring Rama back to Ayodhya. Rama, though much\r\nmoved by his brother's request, declines to return because he must\r\nfulfil his vow of exile. Taking off his gold-embroidered shoes, he\r\ngives them to Bharata as a sign that he hands over his inheritance to\r\nhim. Bharata returning to Ayodhya, places Rama's shoes on the throne,\r\nand keeping the royal umbrella over them, holds council and dispenses\r\njustice by their side.\r\n\r\nRama now sets about the task of combating the formidable giants\r\nthat infest the Dandaka forest and are a terror to the pious hermits\r\nsettled there. Having, by the advice of the sage Agastya, procured\r\nthe weapons of Indra, he begins a successful conflict, in which he\r\nslays many thousands of demons. Their chief, Ravana, enraged and\r\ndetermined on revenge, turns one of his followers into a golden\r\ndeer, which appears to Sita. While Rama and Lakshmana are engaged,\r\nat her request, in pursuit of it, Ravana in the guise of an ascetic\r\napproaches Sita, carries her off by force, and wounds the vulture\r\nJatayu, which guards her abode. Rama on his return is seized with\r\ngrief and despair; but, as he is burning the remains of the vulture,\r\na voice from the pyre proclaims to him how he can conquer his foes\r\nand recover his wife. He now proceeds to conclude a solemn alliance\r\nwith the chiefs of the monkeys, Hanumat and Sugriva. With the help\r\nof the latter, Rama slays the terrible giant Bali. Hanumat meanwhile\r\ncrosses from the mainland to the island of Lanka, the abode of Ravana,\r\nin search of Sita. Here he finds her wandering sadly in a grove and\r\nannounces to her that deliverance is at hand. After slaying a number\r\nof demons, he returns and reports his discovery to Rama. A plan of\r\ncampaign is now arranged. The monkeys having miraculously built a\r\nbridge from the continent to Lanka with the aid of the god of the sea,\r\nRama leads his army across, slays Ravana, and wins back Sita. After\r\nshe has purified herself from the suspicion of infidelity by the\r\nordeal of fire, Rama joyfully returns with her to Ayodhya, where he\r\nreigns gloriously in association with his faithful brother Bharata,\r\nand gladdens his subjects with a new golden age.\r\n\r\nSuch in bare outline is the main story of the Ramayana. By the addition\r\nof the first and last books Valmiki's epic has in the following way\r\nbeen transformed into a poem meant to glorify the god Vishnu. Ravana,\r\nhaving obtained from Brahma the boon of being invulnerable to gods,\r\ndemigods, and demons, abuses his immunity in so terrible a manner\r\nthat the gods are reduced to despair. Bethinking themselves at last\r\nthat Ravana had in his arrogance forgotten to ask that he should not\r\nbe wounded by men, they implore Vishnu to allow himself to be born\r\nas a man for the destruction of the demon. Vishnu, consenting, is\r\nborn as Rama, and accomplishes the task. At the end of the seventh\r\nbook Brahma and the other gods come to Rama, pay homage to him,\r\nand proclaim that he is really Vishnu, \"the glorious lord of the\r\ndiscus.\" The belief here expressed that Rama is an incarnation of\r\nVishnu, the highest god, has secured to the hero of our epic the\r\nworship of the Hindus down to the present day. That belief, forming\r\nthe fundamental doctrine of the religious system of Ramanuja in the\r\ntwelfth and of Ramananda in the fourteenth century, has done much to\r\ncounteract the spread of the degrading superstitions and impurities\r\nof Çivaism both in the South and in the North of India.\r\n\r\nThe Ramayana contains several interesting episodes, though, of course,\r\nfar fewer than the Mahabharata. One of them, a thoroughly Indian\r\nstory, full of exaggerations and impossibilities, is the legend, told\r\nin Book I., of the descent of the Ganges. It relates how the sacred\r\nriver was brought down from heaven to earth in order to purify the\r\nremains of the 60,000 sons of King Sagara, who were reduced to ashes\r\nby the sage Kapila when his devotions were disturbed by them.\r\n\r\nAnother episode (i. 52-65) is that of Viçvamitra, a powerful king,\r\nwho comes into conflict with the great sage Vasishtha by endeavouring\r\nto take away his miraculous cow by force. Viçvamitra then engages\r\nin mighty penances, in which he resists the seductions of beautiful\r\nnymphs, and which extend over thousands of years, till he finally\r\nattains Brahmanhood, and is reconciled with his rival, Vasishtha.\r\n\r\nThe short episode which relates the origin of the çloka metre is one\r\nof the most attractive and poetical. Valmiki in his forest hermitage\r\nis preparing to describe worthily the fortunes of Rama. While he\r\nis watching a fond pair of birds on the bank of the river, the\r\nmale is suddenly shot by a hunter, and falls dead on the ground,\r\nweltering in his blood. Valmiki, deeply touched by the grief of\r\nthe bereaved female, involuntarily utters words lamenting the death\r\nof her mate and threatening vengeance on the wicked murderer. But,\r\nstrange to tell, his utterance is no ordinary speech and flows in a\r\nmelodious stream. As he wanders, lost in thought, towards his hut,\r\nBrahma appears and announces to the poet that he has unconsciously\r\ncreated the rhythm of the çloka metre. The deity then bids him compose\r\nin this measure the divine poem on the life and deeds of Rama. This\r\nstory may have a historical significance, for it indicates with some\r\nprobability that the classical form of the çloka was first fixed by\r\nValmiki, the author of the original part of the Ramayana.\r\n\r\nThe epic contains the following verse foretelling its everlasting\r\nfame:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    As long as mountain ranges stand\r\n    And rivers flow upon the earth:\r\n    So long will this Ramayana\r\n    Survive upon the lips of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis prophecy has been perhaps even more abundantly fulfilled than the\r\nwell-known prediction of Horace. No product of Sanskrit literature\r\nhas enjoyed a greater popularity in India down to the present day\r\nthan the Ramayana. Its story furnishes the subject of many other\r\nSanskrit poems as well as plays, and still delights, from the lips\r\nof reciters, the hearts of myriads of the Indian people, as at the\r\ngreat annual Rama festival held at Benares. It has been translated\r\ninto many Indian vernaculars. Above all, it inspired the greatest poet\r\nof mediæval Hindustan, Tulsi Das, to compose in Hindi his version of\r\nthe epic entitled Ram Charit Manas, which, with its ideal standard\r\nof virtue and purity, is a kind of bible to a hundred millions of\r\nthe people of Northern India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nKAVYA OR COURT EPIC\r\n\r\n(Circa 200 B.C.-1100 A.D.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real history of the Kavya, or artificial epic poetry of India,\r\ndoes not begin till the first half of the seventh century A.D.,\r\nwith the reign of King Harsha-vardhana of Thaneçar and Kanauj\r\n(606-648), who ruled over the whole of Northern India, and under\r\nwhose patronage Bana wrote his historical romance, Harsha-charita,\r\nand other works. The date of no Kavya before this landmark has as yet\r\nbeen fixed with certainty. One work, however, which is dominated by\r\nthe Kavya style, the Brihatsamhita of the astronomer Varahamihira, can\r\nwithout hesitation be assigned to the middle of the sixth century. But\r\nas to the date of the most famous classical poets, Kalidasa, Subandhu,\r\nBharavi, Gunadhya, and others, we have no historical authority. The\r\nmost definite statement that can be made about them is that their fame\r\nwas widely diffused by about 600 A.D., as is attested by the way in\r\nwhich their names are mentioned in Bana and in an inscription of 634\r\nA.D. Some of them, moreover, like Gunadhya, to whose work Subandhu\r\nrepeatedly alludes, must certainly belong to a much earlier time. The\r\nscanty materials supplied by the poets themselves, which might help to\r\ndetermine their dates, are difficult to utilise, because the history\r\nof India, both political and social, during the first five centuries\r\nof our era, is still involved in obscurity.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the age of court poetry in general, we have\r\nthe important literary evidence of the quotations in Patanjali's\r\nMahabhashya, which show that Kavya flourished in his day, and must have\r\nbeen developed before the beginning of our era. Several of these quoted\r\nverses are composed in the artificial metres of the classical poetry,\r\nwhile the heroic anushtubh çlokas agree in matter as well as form,\r\nnot with the popular, but with the court epics.\r\n\r\nWe further know that Açvaghosha's Buddha-charita, or \"Doings of\r\nBuddha,\" was translated into Chinese between 414 and 421 A.D. This\r\nwork not only calls itself a mahakavya, or \"great court epic,\" but\r\nis actually written in the Kavya style. Açvaghosha was, according to\r\nthe Buddhist tradition, a contemporary of King Kanishka, and would\r\nthus belong to the first century A.D. In any case, it is evident that\r\nhis poem could not have been composed later than between 350 and 400\r\nA.D. The mere fact, too, that a Buddhist monk thus early conceived\r\nthe plan of writing the legend of Buddha according to the rules of the\r\nclassical Sanskrit epic shows how popular the Brahmanical artificial\r\npoetry must have become, at any rate by the fourth century A.D.,\r\nand probably long before.\r\n\r\nThe progress of epigraphic research during the last quarter of a\r\ncentury has begun to shed considerable light on the history of court\r\npoetry during the dark age embracing the first five centuries of our\r\nera. Mr. Fleet's third volume of the Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum\r\ncontains no fewer than eighteen inscriptions of importance in this\r\nrespect. These are written mostly in verse, but partly also in elevated\r\nprose. They cover a period of two centuries, from about 350 to 550\r\nA.D. Most of them employ the Gupta era, beginning A.D. 319, and first\r\nused by Chandragupta II., named Vikramaditya, whose inscriptions and\r\ncoins range from A.D. 400 to 413. A few of them employ the Malava era,\r\nthe earlier name of the Vikrama era, which dates from 57 B.C. Several\r\nof these inscriptions are praçastis or panegyrics on kings. An\r\nexamination of them proves that the poetical style prevailing in\r\nthe fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries did not differ from that\r\nof the classical Kavyas which have been preserved. Samudragupta,\r\nthe second of the Gupta line, who belongs to the second half of the\r\nfourth century, was, we learn, himself a poet, as well as a supporter\r\nof poets. Among the latter was at least one, by name Harishena, who in\r\nhis panegyric on his royal patron, which consists of some thirty lines\r\n(nine stanzas) of poetry and about an equal number of lines of prose,\r\nshows a mastery of style rivalling that of Kalidasa and Dandin. In\r\nagreement with the rule of all the Sanskrit treatises on poetics, his\r\nprose is full of inordinately long compounds, one of them containing\r\nmore than 120 syllables. In his poetry he, like Kalidasa and others,\r\nfollows the Vidarbha style, in which the avoidance of long compounds\r\nis a leading characteristic. In this style, which must have been fully\r\ndeveloped by A.D. 300, is also written an inscription by Virasena,\r\nthe minister of Chandragupta II., Samudragupta's successor.\r\n\r\nA very important inscription dates from the year 529 of the Malava\r\n(Vikrama) era, or A.D. 473. It consists of a poem of no fewer than\r\nforty-four stanzas (containing 150 metrical lines), composed by a\r\npoet named Vatsabhatti, to commemorate the consecration of a temple\r\nof the sun at Daçapura (now Mandasor). A detailed examination of this\r\ninscription not only leads to the conclusion that in the fifth century\r\na rich Kavya literature must have existed, but in particular shows that\r\nthe poem has several affinities with Kalidasa's writings. The latter\r\nfact renders it probable that Vatsabhatti, a man of inferior poetic\r\ntalent, who professes to have produced his work with effort, knew and\r\nutilised the poems of Kalidasa. The reign of Chandragupta Vikramaditya\r\nII., at the beginning of the fifth century A.D., therefore seems in the\r\nmeantime the most probable approximate date for India's greatest poet.\r\n\r\nBesides the epigraphic evidence of the Gupta period, we have two\r\nimportant literary prose inscriptions of considerable length, one\r\nfrom Girnar and the other from Nasik, both belonging to the second\r\ncentury A.D. They show that even then there existed a prose Kavya\r\nstyle which, in general character and in many details, resembled that\r\nof the classical tales and romances. For they not only employ long\r\nand frequent compounds, but also the ornaments of alliteration and\r\nvarious kinds of simile and metaphor. Their use of poetical figures\r\nis, however, much less frequent and elaborate, occasionally not\r\ngoing beyond the simplicity of the popular epic. They are altogether\r\nless artificial than the prose parts of Harishena's Kavya, and à\r\nfortiori than the works of Dandin. Subandhu, and Bana. From the Girnar\r\ninscription it appears that its author must have been acquainted with\r\na theory of poetics, that metrical Kavyas conforming to the rules\r\nof the Vidarbha style were composed in his day, and that poetry of\r\nthis kind was cultivated at the courts of princes then as in later\r\ntimes. It cannot be supposed that Kavya literature was a new invention\r\nof the second century; it must, on the contrary, have passed through\r\na lengthened development before that time. Thus epigraphy not merely\r\nconfirms the evidence of the Mahabhashya that artificial court poetry\r\noriginated before the commencement of our era, but shows that that\r\npoetry continued to be cultivated throughout the succeeding centuries.\r\n\r\nThese results of the researches of the late Professor Bühler and of\r\nMr. Fleet render untenable Professor Max Müller's well-known theory\r\nof the renaissance of Sanskrit literature in the sixth century, which\r\nwas set forth by that scholar with his usual brilliance in India,\r\nwhat can it Teach us? and which held the field for several years.\r\n\r\nProfessor Max Müller's preliminary assertion that the Indians,\r\nin consequence of the incursions of the Çakas (Scythians) and\r\nother foreigners, ceased from literary activity during the first\r\ntwo centuries A.D., is refuted by the evidence of the last two\r\ninscriptions mentioned above. Any such interruption of intellectual\r\nlife during that period is, even apart from epigraphical testimony,\r\nrendered highly improbable by other considerations. The Scythians,\r\nin the first place, permanently subjugated only about one-fifth of\r\nIndia; for their dominion, which does not appear to have extended\r\nfarther east than Mathura (Muttra), was limited to the Panjab, Sindh,\r\nGujarat, Rajputana, and the Central Indian Agency. The conquerors,\r\nmoreover, rapidly became Hinduised. Most of them already had Indian\r\nnames in the second generation. One of them, Ushabhadata (the Sanskrit\r\nRishabhadatta), described his exploits in an inscription composed\r\nin a mixture of Sanskrit and Prakrit. Kanishka himself (78 A.D.),\r\nas well as his successors, was a patron of Buddhism; and national\r\nIndian architecture and sculpture attained a high development at\r\nMathura under these rulers. When the invaders thus rapidly acquired\r\nthe civilisation of the comparatively small portion of India they\r\nconquered, there is no reason to assume the suppression of literary\r\nactivity in that part of the country, much less in India as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe main thesis of Professor Max Müller is, that in the middle of\r\nthe sixth century A.D. the reign of a King Vikramaditya of Ujjain,\r\nwith whom tradition connected the names of Kalidasa and other\r\ndistinguished authors, was the golden age of Indian court poetry. This\r\nrenaissance theory is based on Fergusson's ingenious chronological\r\nhypothesis that a supposed King Vikrama of Ujjain, having expelled\r\nthe Scythians from India, in commemoration of his victory founded\r\nthe Vikrama era in 544 A.D., dating its commencement back 600 years\r\nto 57 B.C. The epigraphical researches of Mr. Fleet have destroyed\r\nFergusson's hypothesis. From these researches it results that the\r\nVikrama era of 57 B.C., far from having been founded in 544 A.D.,\r\nhad already been in use for more than a century previously under the\r\nname of the Malava era (which came to be called the Vikrama era about\r\n800 A.D.). It further appears that no Çakas (Scythians) could have\r\nbeen driven out of Western India in the middle of the sixth century,\r\nbecause that country had already been conquered by the Guptas more\r\nthan a hundred years before. Lastly, it turns out that, though other\r\nforeign conquerors, the Hunas, were actually expelled from Western\r\nIndia in the first half of the sixth century, they were driven out,\r\nnot by a Vikramaditya, but by a king named Yaçodharman Vishnuvardhana.\r\n\r\nThus the great King Vikramaditya vanishes from the historical ground\r\nof the sixth century into the realm of myth. With Vikramaditya an\r\noften-quoted but ill-authenticated verse occurring in a work of the\r\nsixteenth century associates Dhanvantari, Kshapanaka, Amarasimha,\r\nVarahamihira, and Vararuchi as among the \"nine gems\" of his court. With\r\nthe disappearance of Vikrama from the sixth century A.D. this verse\r\nhas lost all chronological validity with reference to the date of\r\nthe authors it enumerates; it is even inadmissible to conclude from\r\nsuch legendary testimony that they were contemporaries. Even though\r\none of them, Varahamihira, actually does belong to the sixth century,\r\neach of them can now only be placed in the sixth century separately\r\nand by other arguments. Apart from the mythical Vikramaditya, there\r\nis now no reason to suppose that court poetry attained a special\r\ndevelopment in that century, for Harishena's paneygyric, and some\r\nother epigraphic poems of the Gupta period, show that it flourished\r\ngreatly at least two hundred years earlier.\r\n\r\nNone of the other arguments by which it has been attempted to place\r\nKalidasa separately in the sixth century have any cogency. One of\r\nthe chief of these is derived from the explanation given by the\r\nfourteenth-century commentator, Mallinatha, of the word dignaga,\r\n\"world-elephant,\" occurring in the 14th stanza of Kalidasa's\r\nMeghaduta. He sees in it a punning allusion to Dignaga, a hated\r\nrival of the poet. This explanation, to begin with, is extremely\r\ndubious in itself. Then it is uncertain whether Mallinatha means the\r\nBuddhist teacher Dignaga. Thirdly, little weight can be attached to\r\nthe Buddhistic tradition that Dignaga was a pupil of Vasubandhu, for\r\nthis statement is not found till the sixteenth century. Fourthly, the\r\nassertion that Vasubandhu belongs to the sixth century depends chiefly\r\non the Vikramaditya theory, and is opposed to Chinese evidence, which\r\nindicates that works of Vasubandhu were translated in A.D. 404. Thus\r\nevery link in the chain of this argument is very weak.\r\n\r\nThe other main argument is that Kalidasa must have lived after\r\nAryabhata (A.D. 499), because he shows a knowledge of the scientific\r\nastronomy borrowed from the Greeks. But it has been shown by\r\nDr. Thibaut that an Indian astronomical treatise, undoubtedly written\r\nunder Greek influence, the Romaka Siddhanta, is older than Aryabhata,\r\nand cannot be placed later than A.D. 400. It may be added that a\r\npassage of Kalidasa's Raghuvamça (xiv. 40) has been erroneously\r\nadduced in support of the astronomical argument, as implying that\r\neclipses of the moon are due to the shadow of the earth: it really\r\nrefers only to the spots in the moon as caused, in accordance with\r\nthe doctrine of the Puranas, by a reflection of the earth.\r\n\r\nThus there is, in the present state of our knowledge, good reason to\r\nsuppose that Kalidasa lived not in the sixth, but in the beginning of\r\nthe fifth century A.D. The question of his age, however, is not likely\r\nto be definitely solved till the language, the style, and the poetical\r\ntechnique of each of his works have been minutely investigated, in\r\ncomparison with datable epigraphic documents, as well as with the\r\nrules given by the oldest Sanskrit treatises on poetics.\r\n\r\nAs the popular epic poetry of the Mahabharata was the chief source\r\nof the Puranas, so the Ramayana, the earliest artificial epic, was\r\nsucceeded, though after a long interval of time, by a number of Kavyas\r\nranging from the fifth to the twelfth century. While in the old epic\r\npoetry form is subordinated to matter, it is of primary importance in\r\nthe Kavyas, the matter becoming more and more merely a means for the\r\ndisplay of tricks of style. The later the author of a Kavya is, the\r\nmore he seeks to win the admiration of his audience by the cleverness\r\nof his conceits and the ingenuity of his diction, appealing always\r\nto the head rather than the heart. Even the very best of the Kavyas\r\nwere composed in more strict conformity, with fixed rules than the\r\npoetry of any other country. For not only is the language dominated\r\nby the grammatical rules of Panini, but the style is regulated by\r\nthe elaborate laws about various forms of alliteration and figures\r\nof speech laid down in the treatises on poetics.\r\n\r\nThe two most important Kavyas are Kalidasa's Raghuvamça and\r\nKumara-sambhava, both distinguished by independence of treatment\r\nas well as considerable poetical beauty. They have several stanzas\r\nin common, many others which offer but slight variations, and a\r\nlarge number of passages which, though differing in expression, are\r\nstrikingly analogous in thought. In both poems, too, the same metre is\r\nemployed to describe the same situation. In both poems each canto is,\r\nas a rule, composed in one metre, but changes with the beginning of\r\nthe new canto. The prevailing metres are the classical form of the\r\nanushtubh and the upajati, a development of the Vedic trishtubh.\r\n\r\nThe Raghuvamça, or \"Race of Raghu,\" which consists of nineteen cantos,\r\ndescribes the life of Rama together with an account of his forefathers\r\nand successors. The first nine cantos deal with his nearest four\r\nancestors, beginning with Dilipa and his son Raghu. The story of Rama\r\noccupies the next six (x.-xv.), and agrees pretty closely with that\r\nin the Ramayana of Valmiki, whom Kalidasa here (xv. 41) speaks of as\r\n\"the first poet.\" The following two cantos are concerned with the\r\nthree nearest descendants of Rama, while the last two run through\r\nthe remainder of twenty-four kings who reigned in Ayodhya as his\r\ndescendants, ending rather abruptly with the death of the voluptuous\r\nKing Agnivarna. The names of these successors of Rama agree closely\r\nwith those in the list given in the Vishnu-purana.\r\n\r\nThe narrative in the Raghuvamça moves with some rapidity, not being\r\ntoo much impeded by long descriptions. It abounds with apt and striking\r\nsimiles and contains much genuine poetry, while the style, for a Kavya,\r\nis simple, though many passages are undoubtedly too artificial for\r\nthe European taste. The following stanza, sung by a bard whose duty it\r\nis to waken the king in the morning (v. 75), may serve as a specimen--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The flow'rs to thee presented droop and fade,\r\n    The lamps have lost the wreath of rays they shed,\r\n    Thy sweet-voiced parrot, in his cage confined,\r\n    Repeats the call we sound to waken thee.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than twenty commentaries on the Raghuvamça are known. The most\r\nfamous is the Samjivani of Mallinatha, who explains every word of\r\nthe text, and who has the great merit of endeavouring to find out\r\nand preserve the readings of the poet himself. He knew a number\r\nof earlier commentaries, among which he names with approval those\r\nof Dakshinavarta and Natha. The latter no longer exist. Among the\r\nother extant commentaries may be mentioned the Subodhini, composed\r\nby Dinakara Miçra in 1385, and the Çiçuhitaishini, by a Jain named\r\nCharitravardhana, of which Dinakara's work appears to be an epitome.\r\n\r\nThe Kumara-sambhava, or the \"Birth of the War-god,\" consists, when\r\ncomplete, of seventeen cantos. The first seven are entirely devoted\r\nto the courtship and wedding of the god Çiva and of Parvati, daughter\r\nof Himalaya, the parents of the youthful god. This fact in itself\r\nindicates that description is the prevailing characteristic of the\r\npoem. It abounds in that poetical miniature painting in which lies\r\nthe chief literary strength of the Indian. Affording the poet free\r\nscope for the indulgence of his rich and original imaginative powers,\r\nit is conspicuous for wealth of illustration. The following rendering\r\nof a stanza in the Viyogini metre (in which lines of ten and eleven\r\nsyllables ending iambically alternate) may serve as a specimen. The\r\npoet shows how the duty of a wife following her husband in death is\r\nexemplified even by objects in Nature poetically conceived as spouses--\r\n\r\n\r\n    After the Lord of Night the moonlight goes,\r\n    Along with the cloud the lightning is dissolved:\r\n    Wives ever follow in their husbands' path;\r\n    Even things bereft of sense obey this law.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsually the first seven cantos only are to be found in the printed\r\neditions, owing to the excessively erotic character of the remaining\r\nten. The poem concludes with an account of the destruction of the\r\ndemon Taraka, the object for which the god of war was born.\r\n\r\nMore than twenty commentaries on the Kumara-sambhava have been\r\npreserved. Several of them are by the same authors, notably Mallinatha,\r\nas those on the Raghuvamça.\r\n\r\nThe subject-matter of the later Kavyas, which is derived from the\r\ntwo great epics, becomes more and more mixed up with lyric, erotic,\r\nand didactic elements. It is increasingly regarded as a means for the\r\ndisplay of elaborate conceits, till at last nothing remains but bombast\r\nand verbal jugglery. The Bhatti-kavya, written in Valabhi under King\r\nÇridharasena, probably in the seventh century, and ascribed by various\r\ncommentators to the poet and grammarian Bhartrihari (died 651 A.D.),\r\ndeals in 22 cantos with the story of Rama, but only with the object\r\nof illustrating the forms of Sanskrit grammar.\r\n\r\nThe Kiratarjuniya describes, in eighteen cantos, the combat, first\r\nnarrated in the Mahabharata, between Çiva, in the guise of a Kirata or\r\nmountaineer, and Arjuna. It cannot have been composed later than the\r\nsixth century, as its author, Bharavi, is mentioned in an inscription\r\nof 634 A.D. The fifteenth canto of this poem contains a number of\r\nstanzas illustrating all kinds of verbal tricks like those described in\r\nDandin's Kavyadarça. Thus one stanza (14) contains no consonant but n\r\n(excepting a t at the end); [10] while each half-line in a subsequent\r\none (25), if its syllables be read backwards, is identical with the\r\nother half. [11]\r\n\r\nThe Çiçupala-vadha, or \"Death of Çiçupala,\" describes, in twenty\r\ncantos, how that prince, son of a king of Chedi, and cousin of Krishna,\r\nwas slain by Vishnu. Having been composed by the poet Magha, it also\r\ngoes by the name of Magha-kavya. It probably dates from the ninth,\r\nand must undoubtedly have been composed before the end of the tenth\r\ncentury. The nineteenth canto is full of metrical puzzles, some of a\r\nhighly complex character (e.g. 29). It contains an example of a stanza\r\n(34) which, if read backwards, is identical with the preceding one\r\nread in the ordinary way. At the same time this Kavya is, as a whole,\r\nby no means lacking in poetical beauties and striking thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe Naishadhiya (also called Naishadha-charita), in twenty-two cantos,\r\ndeals with the story of Nala, king of Nishada, the well-known episode\r\nof the Mahabharata. It was composed by Çriharsha, who belongs to the\r\nlatter half of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nThese six artificial epics are recognised as Mahakavyas, or\r\n\"Great Poems,\" and have all been commented on by Mallinatha. The\r\ncharacteristics of this higher class are set forth by Dandin in his\r\nKavyadarça, or \"Mirror of Poetry\" (i. 14-19). Their subjects must\r\nbe derived from epic story (itihasa), they should be extensive, and\r\nought to be embellished with descriptions of cities, seas, mountains,\r\nseasons, sunrise, weddings, battles fought by the hero, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAn extensive Mahakavya, in fifty cantos, is the Haravijaya, or\r\n\"Victory of Çiva,\" by a Kashmirian poet named Ratnakara, who belongs\r\nto the ninth century.\r\n\r\nAnother late epic, narrating the fortunes of the same hero as the\r\nNaishadhiya, is the Nalodaya, or \"Rise of Nala,\" which describes the\r\nrestoration to power of King Nala after he had lost his all. Though\r\nattributed to Kalidasa, it is unmistakably the product of a much\r\nlater age. The chief aim of the author is to show off his skill\r\nin the manipulation of the most varied and artificial metres, as\r\nwell as all the elaborate tricks of style exhibited in the latest\r\nKavyas. Rhyme even is introduced, and that, too, not only at the\r\nend of, but within metrical lines. The really epic material is but\r\nscantily treated, narrative making way for long descriptions and\r\nlyrical effusions. Thus the second and longest of the four cantos\r\nof the poem is purely lyrical, describing only the bliss of the\r\nnewly-wedded pair, with all kinds of irrelevant additions.\r\n\r\nThe culmination of artificiality is attained by the Raghava-pandaviya,\r\na poem composed by Kaviraja, who perhaps flourished about A.D. 800. It\r\ncelebrates simultaneously the actions of Raghava or Rama and of\r\nthe Pandava princes. The composition is so arranged that by the\r\nuse of ambiguous words and phrases the story of the Ramayana and\r\nthe Mahabharata is told at one and the same time. The same words,\r\naccording to the sense in which they are understood, narrate the events\r\nof each epic. A tour de force of this kind is doubtless unique in the\r\nliteratures of the world. Kaviraja has, however, found imitators in\r\nIndia itself.\r\n\r\nA Mahakavya which is as yet only known in MS. is the\r\nNavasahasanka-charita, a poem celebrating the doings of Navasahasanka,\r\notherwise Sindhuraja, a king of Malava, and composed by a poet named\r\nPadmagupta, who lived about 1000 A.D. It consists of eighteen cantos,\r\ncontaining over 1500 stanzas in nineteen different metres. The poet\r\nrefrains from the employment of metrical tricks; but he greatly\r\nimpedes the progress of the narrative by introducing interminable\r\nspeeches and long-winded descriptions.\r\n\r\nWe may mention, in conclusion, that there is also an epic in Prakrit\r\nwhich is attributed to Kalidasa. This is the Setu-bandha, \"Building\r\nof the Bridge,\" or Ravanavadha, \"Death of Ravana,\" which relates\r\nthe story of Rama. It is supposed to have been composed by the poet\r\nto commemorate the building of a bridge of boats across the Vitasta\r\n(Jhelum) by King Pravarasena of Kashmir.\r\n\r\nThere are a few prose romances dating from the sixth and seventh\r\ncenturies, which being classed as Kavyas by the Sanskrit writers\r\non poetics, may be mentioned in this place. The abundant use of\r\nimmense compounds, which of course makes them very difficult reading,\r\nis an essential characteristic of the style of these works. As to\r\ntheir matter, they contain but little action, consisting largely of\r\nscenes which are strung together by a meagre thread of narrative, and\r\nare made the occasion of lengthy descriptions full of long strings\r\nof comparisons and often teeming with puns. In spite, however, of\r\ntheir highly artificial and involved style, many really poetical\r\nthoughts may be found embedded in what to the European taste is an\r\nunattractive setting.\r\n\r\nThe Daça-kumara-charita, or \"Adventures of the Ten Princes,\" contains\r\nstories of common life and reflects a corrupt state of society. It is\r\nby Dandin, and probably dates from the sixth century A.D. Vasavadatta,\r\nby Subandhu, relates the popular story of the heroine Vasavadatta,\r\nprincess of Ujjayini, and Udayana, king of Vatsa. It was probably\r\nwritten quite at the beginning of the seventh century. Slightly\r\nlater is Bana's Kadambari, a poetical romance narrating the fortunes\r\nof a princess of that name. Another work of a somewhat similar\r\ncharacter by the same author is the Harsha-charita, a romance in\r\neight chapters, in which Bana attempts to give some account of the\r\nlife of King Harshavardhana of Kanauj. There is, however, but little\r\nnarrative. Thus in twenty-five pages of the eighth chapter there are\r\nto be found five long descriptions, extending on the average to two\r\npages, to say nothing of shorter ones. There is, for instance, a long\r\ndisquisition, covering four pages, and full of strings of comparisons,\r\nabout the miseries of servitude. A servant, \"like a painted bow,\r\nis for ever bent in the one act of distending a string of imaginary\r\nvirtues, but there is no force in him; like a heap of dust-sweepings\r\ngathered by a broom, he carries off toilet-leavings; like the meal\r\noffered to the Divine Mothers, he is cast out into space even at night;\r\nlike a pumping machine, he has left all weight behind him and bends\r\neven for water,\" and so on. Soon after comes a description, covering\r\ntwo pages, of the trees in a forest. This is immediately followed by\r\nanother page enumerating the various kinds of students thronging the\r\nwood in order to avail themselves of the teaching of a great Buddhist\r\nsage; they even include monkeys busily engaged in ritual ceremonies,\r\ndevout parrots expounding a Buddhist dictionary, owls lecturing on\r\nthe various births of Buddha, and tigers who have given up eating\r\nflesh under the calming influence of Buddhist teaching. Next comes\r\na page describing the sage himself. \"He was clad in a very soft\r\nred cloth, as if he were the eastern quarter of the sky bathed in\r\nthe morning sunshine, teaching the other quarters to assume the red\r\nBuddhist attire, while they were flushed with the pure red glow of\r\nhis body like a ruby freshly cut.\" Soon after comes a long account,\r\nbristling with puns, of a disconsolate princess lying prostrate in the\r\nwood--\"lost in the forest and in thought, bent upon death and the root\r\nof a tree, fallen upon calamity and her nurse's bosom, parted from her\r\nhusband and happiness, burned with the fierce sunshine and the woes\r\nof widowhood, her mouth closed with silence as well as by her hand,\r\nand held fast by her companions as well as by grief. I saw her with her\r\nkindred and her graces all gone, her ears and her soul left bare, her\r\nornaments and her aims abandoned, her bracelets and her hopes broken,\r\nher companions and the needle-like grass-spears clinging round her\r\nfeet, her eye and her beloved fixed within her bosom, her sighs and\r\nher hair long, her limbs and her merits exhausted, her aged attendants\r\nand her streaming tears falling down at her feet,\" and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nLYRIC POETRY\r\n\r\n(Circa 400-1100 A.D.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSanskrit lyrical poetry has not produced many works of any considerable\r\nlength. But among these are included two of the most perfect creations\r\nof Kalidasa, a writer distinguished no less in this field than as\r\nan epic and a dramatic author. His lyrical talent is, indeed, also\r\nsufficiently prominent in his plays.\r\n\r\nKalidasa's Meghaduta, or \"Cloud Messenger,\" is a lyrical gem which\r\nwon the admiration of Goethe. It consists of 115 stanzas composed in\r\nthe Mandakranta metre of four lines of seventeen syllables. The theme\r\nis a message which an exile sends by a cloud to his wife dwelling far\r\naway. The idea is applied by Schiller in his Maria Stuart, where the\r\ncaptive Queen of Scots calls on the clouds as they fly southwards to\r\ngreet the land of her youth (act iii. sc. 1). The exile is a Yaksha or\r\nattendant of Kubera, the god of wealth, who for neglect of his duty\r\nhas been banished to the groves on the slopes of Ramagiri in Central\r\nIndia. Emaciated and melancholy, he sees, at the approach of the rainy\r\nseason, a dark cloud moving northwards. The sight fills his heart with\r\nyearning, and impels him to address to the cloud a request to convey\r\na message of hope to his wife in the remote Himalaya. In the first\r\nhalf of the poem the Yaksha describes with much power and beauty the\r\nvarious scenes the cloud must traverse on its northward course: Mount\r\nAmrakuta, on whose peak it will rest after quenching with showers the\r\nforest fires; the Narmada, winding at the foot of the Vindhya hills;\r\nthe town of Vidiça (Bhilsa), and the stream of the Vetravati (Betwah);\r\nthe city of Ujjayini (Ujjain) in the land of Avanti; the sacred region\r\nof Kurukshetra; the Ganges and the mountains from which she sprang,\r\nwhite with snowfields, till Alaka on Mount Kailasa is finally reached.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the poem the Yaksha first describes the beauties\r\nof this city and his own dwelling there. Going on to paint in glowing\r\ncolours the charms of his wife, her surroundings, and her occupations,\r\nhe imagines her tossing on her couch, sleepless and emaciated, through\r\nthe watches of the night. Then, when her eye rests on the window, the\r\ncloud shall proclaim to her with thunder-sound her husband's message,\r\nthat he is still alive and ever longs to behold her:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    In creepers I discern thy form, in eyes of startled hinds thy\r\n                                                                glances,\r\n    And in the moon thy lovely face, in peacocks' plumes thy shining\r\n                                                                tresses;\r\n    The sportive frown upon thy brow in flowing waters' tiny ripples:\r\n    But never in one place combined can I, alas! behold thy likeness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut courage, he says; our sorrow will end at last--we shall be\r\nre-united--\r\n\r\n\r\n    And then we will our hearts' desire, grown more intense by\r\n                                                             separation,\r\n    Enjoy in nights all glorious and bright, with full-orbed autumn\r\n                                                              moonlight.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen begging the cloud, after delivering his message, to return with\r\nreassuring news, the exile finally dismisses him with the hope that\r\nhe may never, even for a moment, be divided from his lightning spouse.\r\n\r\nBesides the expression of emotion, the descriptive element is very\r\nprominent in this fine poem. This is still more true of Kalidasa's\r\nRitusamhara, or \"Cycle of the Seasons.\" That little work, which\r\nconsists of 153 stanzas in six cantos, and is composed in various\r\nmetres, is a highly poetical description of the six seasons into which\r\nclassical Sanskrit poets usually divide the Indian year. With glowing\r\ndescriptions of the beauties of Nature, in which erotic scenes are\r\ninterspersed, the poet adroitly interweaves the expression of human\r\nemotions. Perhaps no other work of Kalidasa's manifests so strikingly\r\nthe poet's deep sympathy with Nature, his keen powers of observation,\r\nand his skill in depicting an Indian landscape in vivid colours.\r\n\r\nThe poem opens with an account of summer. If the glow of the sun is\r\nthen too great during the day, the moonlit nights are all the more\r\ndelightful to lovers. The moon, beholding the face of beauteous\r\nmaidens, is beside itself with jealousy; then, too, it is that the\r\nheart of the wanderer is burnt by the fire of separation. Next follows\r\na brilliant description of the effects of the heat: the thirst or\r\nlethargy it produces in serpent, lion, elephant, buffalo, boar,\r\ngazelle, peacock, crane, frogs, and fishes; the devastation caused\r\nby the forest fire which devours trees and shrubs, and drives before\r\nit crowds of terror-stricken beasts.\r\n\r\nThe close heat is succeeded by the rains, which are announced by\r\nthe approach of the dark heavy clouds with their banner of lightning\r\nand drum of thunder. Slowly they move accompanied by chataka birds,\r\nfabled to live exclusively on raindrops, till at length they discharge\r\ntheir water. The wild streams, like wanton girls, grasp in a trice\r\nthe tottering trees upon their banks, as they rush onwards to the\r\nsea. The earth becomes covered with young blades of grass, and the\r\nforests clothe themselves with golden buds--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The mountains fill the soul with yearning thoughts of love,\r\n    When rain-charged clouds bend down to kiss the tow'ring rocks,\r\n    When all around upon their slopes the streams gush down,\r\n    And throngs of peacocks that begin to dance are seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext comes the autumn, beauteous as a newly-wedded bride, with face\r\nof full-blown lotuses, with robe of sugarcane and ripening rice, with\r\nthe cry of flamingoes representing the tinkling of her anklets. The\r\ngraceful creepers vie with the arms of lovely women, and the jasmine,\r\nshowing through the crimson açoka blossoms, rivals the dazzling teeth\r\nand red lips of smiling maidens.\r\n\r\nWinter follows, when the rice ripens, while the lotus fades and the\r\nfields in the morning are covered with rime--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Then the Priyangu creeper, reaching ripeness,\r\n    Buffeted constantly by chilling breezes,\r\n    Grows, O Beloved, ever pale and paler,\r\n    Like lonely maiden from her lover parted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the time dear to lovers, whose joys the poet describes in\r\nglowing colours.\r\n\r\nIn the cold season a fire and the mild rays of the sun are\r\npleasant. The night does not attract lovers now, for the moonbeams\r\nare cold and the light of the stars is pale.\r\n\r\nThe poet dwells longest on the delights of spring, the last of the\r\nsix seasons. It is then that maidens, with karnikara flowers on their\r\nears, with red açoka blossoms and sprays of jasmine in their locks,\r\ngo to meet their lovers. Then the hum of intoxicated bees is heard,\r\nand the note of the Indian cuckoo; then the blossoms of the mango-tree\r\nare seen: these are the sharp arrows wherewith the god of the flowery\r\nbow enflames the hearts of maidens to love.\r\n\r\nA lyric poem of a very artificial character, and consisting of only\r\ntwenty-two stanzas, is the Ghata-karpara, or \"Potsherd,\" called after\r\nthe author's name, which is worked into the last verse. The date of\r\nthe poet is unknown. He is mentioned as one of the \"nine gems\" at\r\nthe court of the mythical Vikramaditya in the verse already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Chaura-panchaçika, or \"Fifty Stanzas of the Thief,\" is a\r\nlyrical poem which contains many beauties. Its author was the\r\nKashmirian Bilhana, who belongs to the later half of the eleventh\r\ncentury. According to the romantic tradition, this poet secretly\r\nenjoyed the love of a princess, and when found out was condemned\r\nto death. He thereupon composed fifty stanzas, each beginning with\r\nthe words \"Even now I remember,\" in which he describes with glowing\r\nenthusiasm the joys of love he had experienced. Their effect on the\r\nking was so great that he forgave the poet and bestowed on him the\r\nhand of his daughter.\r\n\r\nThe main bulk of the lyrical creations of mediæval India are not\r\nconnected poems of considerable length, but consist of that miniature\r\npainting which, as with a few strokes, depicts an amatory situation\r\nor sentiment in a single stanza of four lines. These lyrics are in\r\nmany respects cognate to the sententious poetry which the Indians\r\ncultivated with such eminent success. Bearing evidence of great\r\nwealth of observation and depth of feeling, they are often drawn by\r\na master-hand. Many of them are in matter and form gems of perfect\r\nbeauty. Some of their charm is, however, lost in translation owing\r\nto the impossibility of reproducing the elaborate metres employed in\r\nthe original. Several Sanskrit poets composed collections of these\r\nminiature lyrics.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent of these authors is Bhartrihari, grammarian,\r\nphilosopher, and poet in one. Only the literary training of India\r\ncould make such a combination possible, and even there it has hardly\r\na parallel. Bhartrihari lived in the first half of the seventh\r\ncentury. The Chinese traveller I Tsing, who spent more than twenty\r\nyears in India at the end of that century, records that, having\r\nturned Buddhist monk, the poet again became a layman, and fluctuated\r\naltogether seven times between the monastery and the world. Bhartrihari\r\nblamed himself for, but could not overcome, his inconstancy. He wrote\r\nthree centuries of detached stanzas. Of the first and last, which are\r\nsententious in character, there will be occasion to say something\r\nlater. Only the second, entitled Çringara-çataka, or \"Century of\r\nLove,\" deals with erotic sentiment. Here Bhartrihari, in graceful and\r\nmeditative verse, shows himself to be well acquainted both with the\r\ncharms of women and with the arts by which they captivate the hearts\r\nof men. Who, he asks in one of these miniature poems, is not filled\r\nwith yearning thoughts of love in spring, when the air swoons with\r\nthe scent of the mango blossom and is filled with the hum of bees\r\nintoxicated with honey? In another he avers that none can resist the\r\ncharms of lotus-eyed maidens, not even learned men, whose utterances\r\nabout renouncing love are mere idle words. The poet himself laments\r\nthat, when his beloved is away, the brightness goes out of his life--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Beside the lamp, the flaming hearth,\r\n    In light of sun or moon and stars,\r\n    Without my dear one's lustrous eyes\r\n    This world is wholly dark to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time he warns the unwary against reflecting over-much on\r\nfemale beauty--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Let not thy thoughts, O Wanderer,\r\n    Roam in that forest, woman's form:\r\n    For there a robber ever lurks,\r\n    Ready to strike--the God of Love.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another stanza the Indian Cupid appears as a fisherman, who,\r\ncasting on the ocean of this world a hook called woman, quickly\r\ncatches men as fishes eager for the bait of ruddy lips, and bakes\r\nthem in the fire of love.\r\n\r\nStrange are the contradictions in which the poet finds himself involved\r\nby loving a maiden--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Remembered she but causes pain;\r\n    At sight of her my madness grows;\r\n    When touched, she makes my senses reel:\r\n    How, pray, can such an one be loved?\r\n\r\n\r\nSo towards the end of the Century the poet's heart begins to turn\r\nfrom the allurements of love. \"Cease, maiden,\" he exclaims, \"to cast\r\nthy glances on me: thy trouble is in vain. I am an altered man; youth\r\nhas gone by and my thoughts are bent on the forest; my infatuation is\r\nover, and the whole world I now account but as a wisp of straw.\" Thus\r\nBhartrihari prepares the way for his third collection, the \"Century\r\nof Renunciation.\"\r\n\r\nA short but charming treasury of detached erotic verses is the\r\nÇringara-tilaka, which tradition attributes to Kalidasa. In its\r\ntwenty-three stanzas occur some highly imaginative analogies, worked\r\nout with much originality. In one of them, for instance, the poet\r\nasks how it comes that a maiden, whose features and limbs resemble\r\nvarious tender flowers, should have a heart of stone. In another he\r\ncompares his mistress to a hunter--\r\n\r\n\r\n    This maiden like a huntsman is;\r\n    Her brow is like the bow he bends;\r\n    Her sidelong glances are his darts;\r\n    My heart's the antelope she slays.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important lyrical work of this kind is the Amaruçataka,\r\nor \"Hundred stanzas of Amaru.\" The author is a master in the art of\r\npainting lovers in all their moods, bliss and dejection, anger and\r\ndevotion. He is especially skilful in depicting the various stages of\r\nestrangement and reconciliation. It is remarkable how, with a subject\r\nso limited, in situations and emotions so similar, the poet succeeds\r\nin arresting the attention with surprising turns of thought, and\r\nwith subtle touches which are ever new. The love which Amaru as well\r\nas other Indian lyrists portrays is not of the romantic and ideal,\r\nbut rather of the sensuous type. Nevertheless his work often shows\r\ndelicacy of feeling and refinement of thought. Such, for instance,\r\nis the case when he describes a wife watching in the gloaming for\r\nthe return of her absent husband.\r\n\r\nMany lyrical gems are to be found preserved in the Sanskrit treatises\r\non poetics. One such is a stanza on the red açoka. In this the poet\r\nasks the tree to say whither his mistress has gone; it need not shake\r\nits head in the wind, as if to say it did not know; for how could it\r\nbe flowering so brilliantly had it not been touched by the foot of\r\nhis beloved? [12]\r\n\r\nIn all this lyrical poetry the plant and animal world plays an\r\nimportant part and is treated with much charm. Of flowers, the lotus\r\nis the most conspicuous. One of these stanzas, for example, describes\r\nthe day-lotuses as closing their calyx-eyes in the evening, because\r\nunwilling to see the sun, their spouse and benefactor, sink down bereft\r\nof his rays. Another describes with pathetic beauty the dream of a bee:\r\n\"The night will pass, the fair dawn will come, the sun will rise,\r\nthe lotuses will laugh;\" while a bee thus mused within the calyx,\r\nan elephant, alas! tore up the lotus plant.\r\n\r\nVarious birds to which poetical myths are attached are frequently\r\nintroduced as furnishing analogies to human life and love. The chataka,\r\nwhich would rather die of thirst than drink aught but the raindrops\r\nfrom the cloud, affords an illustration of pride. The chakora,\r\nsupposed to imbibe the rays of the moon, affords a parallel to the\r\nlover who with his eyes drinks in the beams of his beloved's face. The\r\nchakravaka, which, fabled to be condemned to nocturnal separation\r\nfrom his mate, calls to her with plaintive cry during the watches of\r\nthe night, serves as an emblem of conjugal fidelity.\r\n\r\nIn all this lyric poetry the bright eyes and beauty of Indian girls\r\nfind a setting in scenes brilliant with blossoming trees, fragrant\r\nwith flowers, gay with the plumage and vocal with the song of birds,\r\ndiversified with lotus ponds steeped in tropical sunshine and with\r\nlarge-eyed gazelles reclining in the shade. Some of its gems are well\r\nworthy of having inspired the genius of Heine to produce such lyrics\r\nas Die Lotosblume and Auf Flügeln des Gesanges.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of lyrical poetry of the same type has also been\r\nproduced in Prakrit, especially in the extensive anthology entitled\r\nSaptaçataka, or \"Seven Centuries,\" of the poet Hala, who probably\r\nlived before A.D. 1000. It contains many beauties, and is altogether a\r\nrich treasury of popular Indian lyrical poetry. It must suffice here\r\nto refer to but one of the stanzas contained in this collection. In\r\nthis little poem the moon is described as a white swan sailing on\r\nthe pure nocturnal lake of the heavens, studded with starry lotuses.\r\n\r\nThe transitional stage between pure lyric and pure drama is represented\r\nby the Gitagovinda, or \"Cowherd in Song,\" a lyrical drama, which,\r\nthough dating from the twelfth century, is the earliest literary\r\nspecimen of a primitive type of play that still survives in Bengal,\r\nand must have preceded the regular dramas. The poem contains no\r\ndialogue in the proper sense, for its three characters only engage\r\nin a kind of lyrical monologue, of which one of the other two is\r\nsupposed to be an auditor, sometimes even no one at all. The subject\r\nof the poem is the love of Krishna for the beautiful cowherdess Radha,\r\nthe estrangement of the lovers, and their final reconciliation. It is\r\ntaken from that episode of Krishna's life in which he himself was a\r\nherdsman (go-vinda), living on the banks of the Yamuna, and enjoying\r\nto the full the love of the cowherdesses. The only three characters\r\nof the poem are Krishna, Radha, and a confidante of the latter.\r\n\r\nIts author, Jayadeva, was probably a native of Bengal, having been\r\na contemporary of a Bengal king named Lakshmanasena. It is probable\r\nthat he took as his model popular plays representing incidents from\r\nthe life of Krishna, as the modern yatras in Bengal still do. The\r\nlatter festival plays even now consist chiefly of lyrical stanzas,\r\npartly recited and partly sung, the dialogue being but scanty, and to\r\na considerable extent left to improvisation. On such a basis Jayadeva\r\ncreated his highly artificial poem. The great perfection of form he\r\nhas here attained, by combining grace of diction with ease in handling\r\nthe most difficult metres, has not failed to win the admiration of\r\nall who are capable of reading the original Sanskrit. Making abundant\r\nuse of alliteration and the most complex rhymes occurring, as in the\r\nNalodaya, not only at the end, but in the middle of metrical lines,\r\n[13] the poet has adapted the most varied and melodious measures\r\nto the expression of exuberant erotic emotions, with a skill which\r\ncould not be surpassed. It seems impossible to reproduce Jayadeva's\r\nverse adequately in an English garb. The German poet Rückert, has,\r\nhowever, come as near to the highly artificial beauty of the original,\r\nboth in form and matter, as is feasible in any translation.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat strange that a poem which describes the transports of\r\nsensual love with all the exuberance of an Oriental fancy should,\r\nin the present instance, and not for the first time, have received\r\nan allegorical explanation in a mystical religious sense. According\r\nto Indian interpreters, the separation of Krishna and Radha, their\r\nseeking for each other, and their final reconciliation represent the\r\nrelation of the supreme deity to the human soul. This may possibly\r\nhave been the intention of Jayadeva, though only as a leading idea,\r\nnot to be followed out in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE DRAMA\r\n\r\n(Circa 400-1000 A.D.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the European mind the history of the Indian drama cannot but be\r\na source of abundant interest; for here we have an important branch\r\nof literature which has had a full and varied national development,\r\nquite independent of Western influence, and which throws much light\r\non Hindu social customs during the five or six centuries preceding\r\nthe Muhammadan conquest.\r\n\r\nThe earliest forms of dramatic literature in India are represented by\r\nthose hymns of the Rigveda which contain dialogues, such as those of\r\nSarama and the Panis, Yama and Yami, Pururavas and Urvaçi, the latter,\r\nindeed, being the foundation of a regular play composed much more than\r\na thousand years later by the greatest dramatist of India. The origin\r\nof the acted drama is, however, wrapt in obscurity. Nevertheless,\r\nthe evidence of tradition and of language suffice to direct us with\r\nconsiderable probability to its source.\r\n\r\nThe words for actor (nata) and play (nataka) are derived from the\r\nverb nat, the Prakrit or vernacular form of the Sanskrit nrit,\r\n\"to dance.\" The name is familiar to English ears in the form of\r\nnautch, the Indian dancing of the present day. The latter, indeed,\r\nprobably represents the beginnings of the Indian drama. It must at\r\nfirst have consisted only of rude pantomime, in which the dancing\r\nmovements of the body were accompanied by mute mimicking gestures of\r\nhand and face. Songs, doubtless, also early formed an ingredient in\r\nsuch performances. Thus Bharata, the name of the mythical inventor\r\nof the drama, which in Sanskrit also means \"actor,\" in several of the\r\nvernaculars signifies \"singer,\" as in the Gujarati Bharot. The addition\r\nof dialogue was the last step in the development, which was thus much\r\nthe same in India and in Greece. This primitive stage is represented by\r\nthe Bengal yatras and the Gitagovinda. These form the transition to the\r\nfully-developed Sanskrit play in which lyrics and dialogue are blended.\r\n\r\nThe earliest references to the acted drama are to be found in the\r\nMahabhashya, which mentions representations of the Kamsavadha, the\r\n\"Slaying of Kamsa,\" and the Balibandha, or \"Binding of Bali,\" episodes\r\nin the history of Krishna. Indian tradition describes Bharata as having\r\ncaused to be acted before the gods a play representing the svayamvara\r\nof Lakshmi, wife of Vishnu. Tradition further makes Krishna and his\r\ncowherdesses the starting-point of the samgita, a representation\r\nconsisting of a mixture of song, music, and dancing. The Gitagovinda\r\nis concerned with Krishna, and the modern yatras generally represent\r\nscenes from the life of that deity. From all this it seems likely\r\nthat the Indian drama was developed in connection with the cult of\r\nVishnu-Krishna, and that the earliest acted representations were\r\ntherefore, like the mysteries of the Christian Middle Ages, a kind\r\nof religious plays, in which scenes from the legend of the god were\r\nenacted mainly with the aid of song and dance, supplemented with\r\nprose dialogue improvised by the performers.\r\n\r\nThe drama has had a rich and varied development in India, as is\r\nshown not only by the numerous plays that have been preserved, but\r\nby the native treatises on poetics which contain elaborate rules for\r\nthe construction and style of plays. Thus the Sahitya-darpana, or\r\n\"Mirror of Rhetoric,\" divides Sanskrit dramas into two main classes,\r\na higher (rupaka) and a lower (uparupaka), and distinguishes no fewer\r\nthan ten species of the former and eighteen of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic features of the Indian drama which strike the\r\nWestern student are the entire absence of tragedy, the interchange\r\nof lyrical stanzas with prose dialogue, and the use of Sanskrit for\r\nsome characters and of Prakrit for others.\r\n\r\nThe Sanskrit drama is a mixed composition, in which joy is mingled\r\nwith sorrow, in which the jester usually plays a prominent part, while\r\nthe hero and heroine are often in the depths of despair. But it never\r\nhas a sad ending. The emotions of terror, grief, or pity, with which\r\nthe audience are inspired, are therefore always tranquillised by the\r\nhappy termination of the story. Nor may any deeply tragic incident\r\ntake place in the course of the play; for death is never allowed to\r\nbe represented on the stage. Indeed nothing considered indecorous,\r\nwhether of a serious or comic character, is allowed to be enacted in\r\nthe sight or hearing of the spectators, such as the utterance of a\r\ncurse, degradation, banishment, national calamity, biting, scratching,\r\nkissing, eating, or sleeping.\r\n\r\nSanskrit plays are full of lyrical passages describing scenes or\r\npersons presented to view, or containing reflections suggested\r\nby the incidents that occur. They usually consist of four-line\r\nstanzas. Çakuntala contains nearly two hundred such, representing\r\nsomething like one half of the whole play. These lyrical passages are\r\ncomposed in a great many different metres. Thus the first thirty-four\r\nstanzas of Çakuntala exhibit no fewer than eleven varieties of\r\nverse. It is not possible, as in the case of the simple Vedic metres,\r\nto imitate in English the almost infinite resources of the complicated\r\nand entirely quantitative classical Sanskrit measures. The spirit\r\nof the lyrical passages is, therefore, probably best reproduced by\r\nusing blank verse as the familiar metre of our drama. The prose of\r\nthe dialogue in the plays is often very commonplace, serving only as\r\nan introduction to the lofty sentiment of the poetry that follows.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with their social position, the various characters in a\r\nSanskrit play speak different dialects. Sanskrit is employed only by\r\nheroes, kings, Brahmans, and men of high rank; Prakrit by all women\r\nand by men of the lower orders. Distinctions are further made in the\r\nuse of Prakrit itself. Thus women of high position employ Maharashtri\r\nin lyrical passages, but otherwise they, as well as children and\r\nthe better class of servants, speak Çauraseni. Magadhi is used,\r\nfor instance, by attendants in the royal palace, Avanti by rogues\r\nor gamblers, Abhiri by cowherds, Paiçachi by charcoal-burners,\r\nand Apabhramça by the lowest and most despised people as well as\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\nThe Sanskrit dramatists show considerable skill in weaving the\r\nincidents of the plot and in the portrayal of individual character,\r\nbut do not show much fertility of invention, commonly borrowing\r\nthe story of their plays from history or epic legend. Love is the\r\nsubject of most Indian dramas. The hero, usually a king, already\r\nthe husband of one or more wives, is smitten at first sight with\r\nthe charms of some fair maiden. The heroine, equally susceptible,\r\nat once reciprocates his affection, but concealing her passion, keeps\r\nher lover in agonies of suspense. Harassed by doubts, obstacles, and\r\ndelays, both are reduced to a melancholy and emaciated condition. The\r\nsomewhat doleful effect produced by their plight is relieved by the\r\nanimated doings of the heroine's confidantes, but especially by the\r\nproceedings of the court-jester (vidushaka), the constant companion\r\nof the hero. He excites ridicule by his bodily defects no less than\r\nhis clumsy interference with the course of the hero's affairs. His\r\nattempts at wit are, however, not of a high order. It is somewhat\r\nstrange that a character occupying the position of a universal,\r\nbutt should always be a Brahman.\r\n\r\nWhile the Indian drama shows some affinities with Greek comedy, it\r\naffords more striking points of resemblance to the productions of the\r\nElizabethan playwrights, and in particular of Shakespeare. The aim\r\nof the Indian dramatists is not to portray types of character, but\r\nindividual persons; nor do they observe the rule of unity of time or\r\nplace. They are given to introducing romantic and fabulous elements;\r\nthey mix prose with verse; they blend the comic with the serious, and\r\nintroduce puns and comic distortions of words. The character of the\r\nvidushaka, too, is a close parallel to the fool in Shakespeare. Common\r\nto both are also several contrivances intended to further the action\r\nof the drama, such as the writing of letters, the introduction of a\r\nplay within a play, the restoration of the dead to life, and the use\r\nof intoxication on the stage as a humorous device. Such a series of\r\ncoincidences, in a case where influence or borrowing is absolutely out\r\nof the question, is an instructive instance of how similar developments\r\ncan arise independently.\r\n\r\nEvery Sanskrit play begins with a prologue or introduction, which\r\nregularly opens with a prayer or benediction (nandi) invoking the\r\nnational deity in favour of the audience. Then generally follows a\r\ndialogue between the stage-manager and one or two actors, which refers\r\nto the play and its author, seeks to win public favour by paying\r\na complimentary tribute to the critical acumen of the spectators,\r\nmentions past events and present circumstances elucidating the plot,\r\nand invariably ends by adroitly introducing one of the characters of\r\nthe actual play. A Sanskrit drama is divided into scenes and acts. The\r\nformer are marked by the entrance of one character and the exit of\r\nanother. The stage is never left vacant till the end of the act,\r\nnor does any change of locality take place till then. Before a new\r\nact an interlude (called vishkambha or praveçaka), consisting of a\r\nmonologue or dialogue, is often introduced. In this scene allusion\r\nis made to events supposed to have occurred in the interval, and the\r\naudience are prepared for what is about to take place. The whole piece\r\ncloses with a prayer for national prosperity, which is addressed to\r\nthe favourite deity and is spoken by one of the principal characters.\r\n\r\nThe number of acts in a play varies from one to ten; but, while\r\nfluctuating somewhat, is determined by the character of the drama. Thus\r\nthe species called natika has four acts and the farcical prahasana\r\nonly one.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the events is supposed to be identical with the\r\ntime occupied in performing them on the stage, or, at most, a day;\r\nand a night is assumed to elapse between each act and that which\r\nfollows. Occasionally, however, the interval is much longer. Thus in\r\nKalidasa's Çakuntala and Urvaçi several years pass between the first\r\nand the last act; while in Bhavabhuti's Uttara-ramacharita no less\r\nthan twelve years elapse between the first and the second act.\r\n\r\nNor is unity of place observed; for the scene may be transferred from\r\none part of the earth to another, or even to the aërial regions. Change\r\nof locality sometimes occurs even within the same act; as when a\r\njourney is supposed to be performed through the air in a celestial\r\ncar. It is somewhat curious that while there are many and minute\r\nstage directions about dress and decorations no less than about the\r\nactions of the players, nothing is said in this way as to change\r\nof scene. As regards the number of characters appearing in a play,\r\nno limit of any kind is imposed.\r\n\r\nThere were no special theatres in the Indian Middle Ages, and plays\r\nseem to have been performed in the concert-room (samgita-çala) of royal\r\npalaces. A curtain divided in the middle was a necessary part of the\r\nstage arrangement; it did not, however, separate the audience from\r\nthe stage, as in the Roman theatre, but formed the background of the\r\nstage. Behind the curtain was the tiring-room (nepathya), whence the\r\nactors came on the stage. When they were intended to enter hurriedly,\r\nthey were directed to do so \"with a toss of the curtain.\" The stage\r\nscenery and decorations were of a very simple order, much being\r\nleft to the imagination of the spectator, as in the Shakespearean\r\ndrama. Weapons, seats, thrones, and chariots appeared on the stage;\r\nbut it is highly improbable that the latter were drawn by the living\r\nanimals supposed to be attached to them. Owing to the very frequent\r\nintercourse between the inhabitants of heaven and earth, there may\r\nhave been some kind of aërial contrivance to represent celestial\r\nchariots; but owing to the repeated occurrence of the stage direction\r\n\"gesticulating\" (natayitva) in this connection, it is to be supposed\r\nthat the impression of motion and speed was produced on the audience\r\nsimply by the gestures of the actors.\r\n\r\nThe best productions of the Indian drama are nearly a dozen in number,\r\nand date from a period embracing something like four hundred years,\r\nfrom about the beginning of the fifth to the end of the eighth century\r\nA.D. These plays are the compositions of the great dramatists Kalidasa\r\nand Bhavabhuti, or have come down under the names of the royal patrons\r\nÇudraka and Çriharsha, to whom their real authors attributed them.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of all is Kalidasa, already known to us as the author of\r\nseveral of the best Kavyas. Three of his plays have been preserved,\r\nÇakuntala, Vikramorvaçi, and Malavikagnimitra. The richness of creative\r\nfancy which he displays in these, and his skill in the expression\r\nof tender feeling, assign him a high place among the dramatists of\r\nthe world. The harmony of the poetic sentiment is nowhere disturbed\r\nby anything violent or terrifying. Every passion is softened without\r\nbeing enfeebled. The ardour of love never goes beyond æsthetic bounds;\r\nit never maddens to wild jealousy or hate. The torments of sorrow\r\nare toned down to a profound and touching melancholy. It was here at\r\nlast that the Indian genius found the law of moderation in poetry,\r\nwhich it hardly knew elsewhere, and thus produced works of enduring\r\nbeauty. Hence it was that Çakuntala exercised so great a fascination\r\non the calm intellect of Goethe, who at the same time was so strongly\r\nrepelled by the extravagances of Hindu mythological art.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the Greek and the modern drama, Nature occupies\r\na much more important place in Sanskrit plays. The characters are\r\nsurrounded by Nature, with which they are in constant communion. The\r\nmango and other trees, creepers, lotuses, and pale-red trumpet-flowers,\r\ngazelles, flamingoes, bright-hued parrots, and Indian cuckoos, in\r\nthe midst of which they move, are often addressed by them and form an\r\nessential part of their lives. Hence the influence of Nature on the\r\nminds of lovers is much dwelt on. Prominent everywhere in classical\r\nSanskrit poetry, these elements of Nature luxuriate most of all in\r\nthe drama.\r\n\r\nThe finest of Kalidasa's works are, it cannot be denied, defective\r\nas stage-plays. The very delicacy of the sentiment, combined with\r\na certain want of action, renders them incapable of producing a\r\npowerful effect on an audience. The best representatives of the\r\nromantic drama of India are Çakuntala and Vikramorvaçi. Dealing\r\nwith the love adventures of two famous kings of ancient epic legend,\r\nthey represent scenes far removed from reality, in which heaven and\r\nearth are not separated, and men, demigods, nymphs, and saints are\r\nintermingled. Malavikagnimitra, on the other hand, not concerned\r\nwith the heroic or divine, is a palace-and-harem drama, a story of\r\ncontemporary love and intrigue.\r\n\r\nThe plot of Çakuntala is derived from the first book of the\r\nMahabharata. The hero is Dushyanta, a celebrated king of ancient\r\ndays, the heroine, Çakuntala, the daughter of a celestial nymph,\r\nMenaka, and of the sage Viçvamitra; while their son, Bharata, became\r\nthe founder of a famous race. The piece consists of seven acts, and\r\nbelongs to the class of drama by native writers on poetics styled\r\nnataka, or \"the play.\" In this the plot must be taken from mythology\r\nor history, the characters must be heroic or divine; it should be\r\nwritten in elaborate style, and full of noble sentiments, with five\r\nacts at least, and not more than ten.\r\n\r\nAfter the prelude, in which an actress sings a charming lyric on the\r\nbeauties of summer-time, King Dushyanta appears pursuing a gazelle in\r\nthe sacred grove of the sage Kanva. Here he catches sight of Çakuntala,\r\nwho, accompanied by her two maiden friends, is engaged in watering\r\nher favourite trees. Struck by her beauty, he exclaims--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Her lip is ruddy as an opening bud.\r\n    Her graceful arms resemble tender shoots:\r\n    Attractive as the bloom upon the tree,\r\n    The glow of youth is spread on all her limbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeizing an opportunity of addressing her, he soon feels that it is\r\nimpossible for him to return to his capital--\r\n\r\n\r\n    My limbs move forward, while my heart flies back,\r\n    Like silken standard borne against the breeze.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second act the comic element is introduced with the jester\r\nMathavya, who is as much disgusted with his master's love-lorn\r\ncondition as with his fondness for the chase. In the third act,\r\nthe love-sick Çakuntala is discovered lying on a bed of flowers in\r\nan arbour. The king overhears her conversation with her two friends,\r\nshows himself, and offers to wed the heroine. An interlude explains\r\nhow a choleric ascetic, named Durvasa, enraged at not being greeted\r\nby Çakuntala with due courtesy, owing to her pre-occupied state, had\r\npronounced a curse which should cause her to be entirely forgotten\r\nby her lover, who could recognise her only by means of a ring.\r\n\r\nThe king having meanwhile married Çakuntala and returned home,\r\nthe sage Kanva has resolved to send her to her husband. The way in\r\nwhich Çakuntala takes leave of the sacred grove in which she has\r\nbeen brought up, of her flowers, her gazelles, and her friends,\r\nis charmingly described in the fourth act. This is the act which\r\ncontains the most obvious beauties; for here the poet displays to the\r\nfull the richness of his fancy, his abundant sympathy with Nature,\r\nand a profound knowledge of the human heart.\r\n\r\nA young Brahman pupil thus describes the dawning of the day on which\r\nÇakuntala is to leave the forest hermitage--\r\n\r\n\r\n    On yonder side the moon, the Lord of Plants,\r\n    Sinks down behind the western mountain's crest;\r\n    On this, the sun preceded by the dawn\r\n    Appears: the setting and the rise at once\r\n    Of these two orbs the symbols are of man's\r\n    Own fluctuating fortunes in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he continues--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The moon has gone; the lilies on the lake,\r\n    Whose beauty lingers in the memory,\r\n    No more delight my gaze: they droop and fade;\r\n    Deep is their sorrow for their absent lord.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aged hermit of the grove thus expresses his feelings at the\r\napproaching loss of Çakuntala--\r\n\r\n\r\n    My heart is touched with sadness at the thought\r\n    \"Çakuntala must go to-day\"; my throat\r\n    Is choked with flow of tears repressed; my sight\r\n    Is dimmed with pensiveness; but if the grief\r\n    Of an old forest hermit is so great,\r\n    How keen must be the pang a father feels\r\n    When freshly parted from a cherished child!\r\n\r\n\r\nThen calling on the trees to give her a kindly farewell, he exclaims--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The trees, the kinsmen of her forest home,\r\n    Now to Çakuntala give leave to go:\r\n    They with the Kokila's melodious cry\r\n    Their answer make.\r\n\r\n\r\nThereupon the following good wishes are uttered by voices in the air--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thy journey be auspicious; may the breeze,\r\n    Gentle and soothing, fan thy cheek; may lakes\r\n    All bright with lily cups delight thine eye;\r\n    The sunbeams' heat be cooled by shady trees;\r\n    The dust beneath thy feet the pollen be\r\n    Of lotuses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fifth act, in which Çakuntala appears before her husband, is deeply\r\nmoving. The king fails to recognise her, and, though treating her not\r\nunkindly, refuses to acknowledge her as his wife. As a last resource,\r\nÇakuntala bethinks herself of the ring given her by her husband,\r\nbut on discovering that it is lost, abandons hope. She is then borne\r\noff to heaven by celestial agency.\r\n\r\nIn the following interlude we see a fisherman dragged along by\r\nconstables for having in his possession the royal signet-ring, which he\r\nprofesses to have found inside a fish. The king, however, causes him\r\nto be set free, rewarding him handsomely for his find. Recollection\r\nof his former love now returns to Dushyanta. While he is indulging in\r\nsorrow at his repudiation of Çakuntala, Matali, Indra's charioteer,\r\nappears on the scene to ask the king's aid in vanquishing the demons.\r\n\r\nIn the last act Dushyanta is seen driving in Indra's car to Hemakuta,\r\nthe mountain of the Gandharvas. Here he sees a young boy playing with\r\na lion cub. Taking his hand, without knowing him to be his own son,\r\nhe exclaims--\r\n\r\n\r\n    If now the touch of but a stranger's child\r\n    Thus sends a thrill of joy through all my limbs,\r\n    What transports must he waken in the soul\r\n    Of that blest father from whose loins he sprang!\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after he finds and recognises Çakuntala, with whom he is at\r\nlength happily reunited.\r\n\r\nKalidasa's play has come down to us in two main recensions. The\r\nso-called Devanagari one, shorter and more concise, is probably the\r\nolder and better. The more diffuse Bengal recension became known\r\nfirst through the translation of Sir William Jones.\r\n\r\nVikramorvaçi, or \"Urvaçi won by Valour,\" is a play in five acts,\r\nbelonging to the class called Trotaka, which is described as\r\nrepresenting events partly terrestrial and partly celestial, and as\r\nconsisting of five, seven, eight, or nine acts. Its plot is briefly\r\nas follows. King Pururavas, hearing from nymphs that their companion,\r\nUrvaçi, has been carried off by demons, goes to the rescue and brings\r\nher back on his car. He is enraptured by the beauty of the nymph, no\r\nless than she is captivated by her deliverer. Urvaçi being summoned\r\nbefore the throne of Indra, the lovers are soon obliged to part.\r\n\r\nIn the second act Urvaçi appears for a short time to the king as\r\nhe disconsolately wanders in the garden. A letter, in which she\r\nhad written a confession of her love, is discovered by the queen,\r\nwho refuses to be pacified.\r\n\r\nIn the third act we learn that Urvaçi had been acting before Indra\r\nin a play representing the betrothal of Lakshmi, and had, when asked\r\non whom her heart was set, named Pururavas instead of Purushottama\r\n(i.e. Vishnu). She is consequently cursed by her teacher, Bharata,\r\nbut is forgiven by Indra, who allows her to be united with Pururavas\r\ntill the latter sees his offspring.\r\n\r\nThe fourth act is peculiar in being almost entirely lyrical. The\r\nlovers are wandering near Kailasa, the divine mountain, when Urvaçi,\r\nin a fit of jealousy, enters the grove of Kumara, god of war, which is\r\nforbidden to all females. In consequence of Bharata's curse, she is\r\ninstantly transformed into a creeper. The king, beside himself with\r\ngrief at her loss, seeks her everywhere. He apostrophises various\r\ninsects, birds, beasts, and even a mountain peak, to tell him where\r\nshe is. At last he thinks he sees her in the mountain stream:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The rippling wave is like her frown; the row\r\n    Of tossing birds her girdle; streaks of foam\r\n    Her flutt'ring garment as she speeds along;\r\n    The current, her devious and stumbling gait:\r\n    'Tis she turned in her wrath into a stream.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, under the influence of a magic stone, which has come into\r\nhis possession, he clasps a creeper, which is transformed into Urvaçi\r\nin his arms.\r\n\r\nBetween the fourth and fifth acts several years elapse. Then Pururavas,\r\nby accident, discovers his son Ayus, whom Urvaçi had secretly borne,\r\nand had caused to be brought up in a hermitage. Urvaçi must therefore\r\nreturn to heaven. Indra, however, in return for Pururavas' services\r\nagainst the demons, makes a new concession, and allows the nymph to\r\nremain with the king for good.\r\n\r\nThere are two recensions of this play also, one of them belonging to\r\nSouthern India.\r\n\r\nThe doubts long entertained, on the ground of its inferiority and\r\ndifferent character, as to whether Malavikagnimitra, or \"Malavika and\r\nAgnimitra,\" is really the work of Kalidasa, who is mentioned in the\r\nprologue as the author, are hardly justified. The piece has been shown\r\nby Weber to agree pretty closely in thought and diction with the two\r\nother plays of the poet; and though certainly not equal to the latter\r\nin poetic merit, it possesses many beauties. The subject is not heroic\r\nor divine, the plot being derived from the ordinary palace life of\r\nIndian princes, and thus supplying a peculiarly good picture of the\r\nsocial conditions of the times. The hero is a historical king of the\r\ndynasty of the Çungas, who reigned at Vidiça (Bhilsa) in the second\r\ncentury B.C. The play describes the loves of this king Agnimitra and\r\nof Malavika, one of the attendants of the queen, who jealously keeps\r\nher out of the king's sight on account of her great beauty. The various\r\nendeavours of the king to see and converse with Malavika give rise to\r\nnumerous little intrigues. In the course of these Agnimitra nowhere\r\nappears as a despot, but acts with much delicate consideration for\r\nthe feelings of his spouses. It finally turns out that Malavika is by\r\nbirth a princess, who had only come to be an attendant at Agnimitra's\r\ncourt through having fallen into the hands of robbers. There being\r\nnow no objection to her union with the king, all ends happily.\r\n\r\nWhile Kalidasa stands highest in poetical refinement, in tenderness,\r\nand depth of feeling, the author of the Mricchakatika, or \"Clay Cart,\"\r\nis pre-eminent among Indian playwrights for the distinctively dramatic\r\nqualities of vigour, life, and action, no less than sharpness of\r\ncharacterisation, being thus allied in genius to Shakespeare. This\r\nplay is also marked by originality and good sense. Attributed to\r\na king named Çudraka, who is panegyrised in the prologue, it is\r\nprobably the work of a poet patronised by him, perhaps Dandin, as\r\nProfessor Pischel thinks. In any case, it not improbably belongs\r\nto the sixth century. It is divided into ten acts, and belongs to\r\nthe dramatic class called prakarana. The name has little to do with\r\nthe play, being derived from an unimportant episode of the sixth\r\nact. The scene is laid in Ujjayini and its neighbourhood. The number\r\nof characters appearing on the stage is very considerable. The chief\r\namong them are Charudatta, a Brahman merchant who has lost all his\r\nproperty by excessive liberality, and Vasantasena, a rich courtesan\r\nwho loves the poor but noble Charudatta, and ultimately becomes his\r\nwife. The third act contains a humorous account of a burglary, in\r\nwhich stealing is treated as a fine art. In the fourth act there is a\r\ndetailed description of the splendours of Vasantasena's palace. Though\r\ncontaining much exaggeration, it furnishes an interesting picture of\r\nthe kind of luxury that prevailed in those days. Altogether this play\r\nabounds in comic situations, besides containing many serious scenes,\r\nsome of which even border on the tragic.\r\n\r\nTo the first half of the seventh century belong the two dramas\r\nattributed to the famous King Çriharsha or Harshadeva, a patron\r\nof poets, whom we already know as Harshavardhana of Thaneçar and\r\nKanauj. Ratnavali, or \"The Pearl Necklace,\" reflecting the court and\r\nharem life of the age, has many points of similarity with Kalidasa's\r\nMalavikagnimitra, by which, indeed, its plot was probably suggested. It\r\nis the story of the loves of Udayana, king of Vatsa, and of Sagarika,\r\nan attendant of his queen Vasavadatta. The heroine ultimately turns\r\nout to be Ratnavali, princess of Ceylon, who had found her way to\r\nUdayana's court after suffering shipwreck. The plot is unconnected\r\nwith mythology, but is based on an historical or epic tradition, which\r\nrecurs in a somewhat different form in Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara. As\r\nconcerned with the second marriage of the king, it forms a sequel to\r\nthe popular love-story of Vasavadatta. It is impossible to say whether\r\nthe poet modified the main outlines of the traditional story, but the\r\ncharacter of the magician who conjures up a vision of the gods and a\r\nconflagration, is his invention, as well as the incidents, which are\r\nof an entirely domestic nature. The real author was doubtless some\r\npoet resident at Çriharsha's court, possibly Bana, who also wrote a\r\nplay entitled Parvatiparinaya.\r\n\r\nAltogether, Ratnavali is an agreeable play, with well-drawn characters\r\nand many poetical beauties. Of the latter the following lines, in\r\nwhich the king describes the pale light in the east heralding the\r\nrise of the moon, may serve as a specimen:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our minds intent upon the festival,\r\n    We saw not that the twilight passed away:\r\n    Behold, the east proclaims the lord of night\r\n    Still hidden by the mountain where he rises,\r\n    Even as a maiden by her pale face shows\r\n    That in her inmost heart a lover dwells.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother play of considerable merit attributed to Çriharsha is\r\nNagananda. It is a sensational piece with a Buddhistic colouring, the\r\nhero being a Buddhist and Buddha being praised in the introductory\r\nbenediction. For this reason its author was probably different from\r\nthat of Ratnavali, and may have been Dhavaka, who, like Bana, is\r\nknown to have lived at the court of Çriharsha.\r\n\r\nThe dramatist Bhavabhuti was a Brahman of the Taittiriya school of the\r\nYajurveda and belonged, as we learn from his prologues, to Vidarbha\r\n(now Berar) in Southern India. He knew the city of Ujjayini well,\r\nand probably spent at least a part of his life there. His patron was\r\nKing Yaçovarman of Kanyakubja (Kanauj), who ruled during the first\r\nhalf of the eighth century.\r\n\r\nThree plays by this poet, all abounding in poetic beauties, have come\r\ndown to us. They contrast in two or three respects with the works of\r\nthe earlier dramatists. The absence of the character of the jester is\r\ncharacteristic of them, the comic and witty element entering into them\r\nonly to a slight extent. While other Indian poets dwell on the delicate\r\nand mild beauties of Nature, Bhavabhuti loves to depict her grand and\r\nsublime aspects, doubtless owing to the influence on his mind of the\r\nsouthern mountains of his native land. He is, moreover, skilful not\r\nonly in drawing characters inspired by tender and noble sentiment,\r\nbut in giving effective expression to depth and force of passion.\r\n\r\nThe best known and most popular of Bhavabhuti's plays is\r\nMalati-madhava, a prakarana in ten acts. The scene is laid in Ujjayini,\r\nand the subject is the love-story of Malati, daughter of a minister\r\nof the country, and Madhava, a young scholar studying in the city,\r\nand son of the minister of another state. Skilfully interwoven with\r\nthis main story are the fortunes of Makaranda, a friend of Madhava,\r\nand Madayantika, a sister of the king's favourite. Malati and Madhava\r\nmeet and fall in love; but the king has determined that the heroine\r\nshall marry his favourite, whom she detests. This plan is frustrated by\r\nMakaranda, who, personating Malati, goes through the wedding ceremony\r\nwith the bridegroom. The lovers, aided in their projects by two amiable\r\nBuddhist nuns, are finally united. The piece is a sort of Indian Romeo\r\nand Juliet with a happy ending, the part played by the nun Kamandaki\r\nbeing analogous to that of Friar Laurence in Shakespeare's drama. The\r\ncontrast produced by scenes of tender love, and the horrible doings\r\nof the priestess of the dread goddess Durga, is certainly effective,\r\nbut perhaps too violent. The use made of swoons, from which the\r\nrecovery is, however, very rapid, is rather too common in this play.\r\n\r\nThe ninth act contains several fine passages describing the scenery\r\nof the Vindhya range. The following is a translation of one of them:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    This mountain with its towering rocks delights\r\n    The eye: its peaks grow dark with gathering clouds;\r\n    Its groves are thronged with peacocks eloquent\r\n    In joy; the trees upon its slopes are bright\r\n    With birds that flit about their nests; the caves\r\n    Reverberate the growl of bears; the scent\r\n    Of incense-trees is wafted, sharp and cool,\r\n    From branches broken off by elephants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other two dramas of Bhavabhuti represent the fortunes of the\r\nsame national hero, Rama. The plot of the Mahavira-charita, or \"The\r\nFortunes of the Great Hero,\" varies but slightly from the story told\r\nin the Ramayana. The play, which is divided into seven acts and is\r\ncrowded with characters, concludes with the coronation of Rama. The\r\nlast act illustrates well how much is left to the imagination of the\r\nspectator. It represents the journey of Rama in an aërial car from\r\nCeylon all the way to Ayodhya (Oudh) in Northern India, the scenes\r\ntraversed being described by one of the company.\r\n\r\nThe Uttara-rama-charita, or \"The Later Fortunes of Rama,\" is a\r\nromantic piece containing many fine passages. Owing to lack of action,\r\nhowever, it is rather a dramatic poem than a play. The description of\r\nthe tender love of Rama and Sita, purified by sorrow, exhibits more\r\ngenuine pathos than appears perhaps in any other Indian drama. The\r\nplay begins with the banishment of Sita and ends with her restoration,\r\nafter twelve years of grievous solitude, to the throne of Ayodhya\r\namid popular acclamations. Her two sons, born after her banishment and\r\nreared in the wilderness by the sage Valmiki, without any knowledge of\r\ntheir royal descent, furnish a striking parallel to the two princes\r\nGuiderius and Arviragus who are brought up by the hermit Belarius in\r\nShakespeare's Cymbeline. The scene in which their meeting with their\r\nfather Rama is described reaches a high degree of poetic merit.\r\n\r\nAmong the works of other dramatists, Viçakhadatta's Mudra-rakshasa,\r\nor \"Rakshasa and the Seal,\" deserves special mention because of\r\nits unique character. For, unlike all the other dramas hitherto\r\ndescribed, it is a play of political intrigue, composed, moreover,\r\nwith much dramatic talent, being full of life, action, and sustained\r\ninterest. Nothing more definite can be said as to its date than that\r\nit was probably written not later than about 800 A.D. The action of\r\nthe piece takes place in the time of Chandragupta, who, soon after\r\nAlexander's invasion of India, founded a new dynasty at Pataliputra\r\nby deposing the last king of the Nanda line. Rakshasa, the minister\r\nof the latter, refusing to recognise the usurper, endeavours to be\r\navenged on him for the ruin of his late master. The plot turns on\r\nthe efforts of the Brahman Chanakya, the minister of Chandragupta,\r\nto win over the noble Rakshasa to his master's cause. In this he is\r\nultimately successful.\r\n\r\nBhatta Narayana's Venisamhara, or \"Binding of the braid of hair,\"\r\nis a play in six acts, deriving its plot from the Mahabharata. Its\r\naction turns on the incident of Draupadi being dragged by the hair of\r\nher head into the assembly by one of the brothers of Duryodhana. Its\r\nage is known from its author having been the grantee of a copperplate\r\ndated 840 A.D. Though not conspicuous for poetic merit, it has long\r\nbeen a great favourite in India owing to its express partiality for\r\nthe cult of Krishna.\r\n\r\nTo about 900 A.D. belongs the poet Rajaçekhara, the distinguishing\r\nfeature of whose dramas are lightness and grace of diction. Four\r\nof his plays have survived, and are entitled Viddha-çalabhanjika,\r\nKarpura-manjari, Bala-ramayana, and Prachanda-pandava or Bala-bharata.\r\n\r\nThe poet Kshemiçvara, who probably lived in the tenth century\r\nA.D. at Kanyakubja under King Mahipala, is the author of a play named\r\nChandakauçika, or \"The Angry Kauçika.\"\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh century Damodara Miçra composed the Hanuman-nataka,\r\n\"The Play of Hanumat,\" also called Maha-nataka, or \"The Great\r\nPlay.\" According to tradition, he lived at the court of Bhoja, king of\r\nMalava, who resided at Dhara (now Dhar) and Ujjayini (Ujjain) in the\r\nearly part of the eleventh century. It is a piece of little merit,\r\ndealing with the story of Rama in connection with his ally Hanumat,\r\nthe monkey chief. It consists of fourteen acts, lacking coherence,\r\nand producing the impression of fragments patched together.\r\n\r\nKrishna miçra's Prabodha-chandrodaya, or \"Rise of the Moon of\r\nKnowledge,\" a play in six acts, dating from about the end of the\r\neleventh century, deserves special attention as one of the most\r\nremarkable products of Indian literature. Though an allegorical piece\r\nof theologico-philosophical purport, in which practically only abstract\r\nnotions and symbolical figures act as persons, it is remarkable for\r\ndramatic life and vigour. It aims at glorifying orthodox Brahmanism\r\nin the Vishnuite sense, just as the allegorical plays of the Spanish\r\npoet Calderon were intended to exalt the Catholic faith. The Indian\r\npoet has succeeded in the difficult task of creating an attractive\r\nplay with abstractions like Revelation, Will, Reason, Religion, by\r\ntransforming them into living beings of flesh and blood. The evil\r\nKing Error appears on the scene as ruler of Benares, surrounded by\r\nhis faithful adherents, the Follies and Vices, while Religion and\r\nthe noble King Reason, accompanied by all the Virtues, have been\r\nbanished. There is, however, a prophecy that Reason will some day\r\nbe re-united with Revelation; the fruit of the union will be True\r\nKnowledge, which will destroy the reign of Error. The struggle for\r\nthis union and its consummation, followed by the final triumph of\r\nthe good party, forms the plot of the piece.\r\n\r\nA large number of Sanskrit plays have been written since the twelfth\r\ncentury [14] down to modern times, their plots being generally derived\r\nfrom the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Besides these, there are farces\r\nin one or more acts, mostly of a coarse type, in which various vices,\r\nsuch as hypocrisy, are satirised. These later productions reach a\r\nmuch lower level of art than the works of the early Indian dramatists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFAIRY TALES AND FABLES\r\n\r\n(Circa 400-1100 A.D.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe didactic and sententious note which prevails in classical\r\nSanskrit literature cannot fail to strike the student. It is, however,\r\nspecially pronounced in the fairy tales and fables, where the abundant\r\nintroduction of ethical reflections and proverbial philosophy is\r\ncharacteristic. The apologue with its moral is peculiarly subject to\r\nthis method of treatment.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing feature of the Sanskrit collections of fairy tales\r\nand fables, which are to a considerable extent found mixed together,\r\nis the insertion of a number of different stories within the framework\r\nof a single narrative. The characters of the main story in turn relate\r\nvarious tales to edify one another or to prove the correctness of their\r\nown special views. As within the limits of a minor story a second\r\none can be similarly introduced and the process further repeated,\r\nthe construction of the whole work comes to resemble that of a set\r\nof Chinese boxes. This style of narration was borrowed from India by\r\nthe neighbouring Oriental peoples of Persia and Arabia, who employed\r\nit in composing independent works. The most notable instance is,\r\nof course, the Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nThe Panchatantra, so called because it is divided into five books, is,\r\nfrom the literary point of view, the most important and interesting\r\nwork in this branch of Indian literature. It consists for the most part\r\nof fables, which are written in prose with an admixture of illustrative\r\naphoristic verse. At what time this collection first assumed definite\r\nshape, it is impossible to say. We know, however, that it existed in\r\nthe first half of the sixth century A.D., since it was translated by\r\norder of King Khosru Anushirvan (531-79) into Pehlevi, the literary\r\nlanguage of Persia at that time. We may, indeed, assume that it was\r\nknown in the fifth century; for a considerable time must have elapsed\r\nbefore it became so famous that a foreign king desired its translation.\r\n\r\nIf not actually a Buddhistic work, the Panchatantra must be derived\r\nfrom Buddhistic sources. This follows from the fact that a number of\r\nits fables can be traced to Buddhistic writings, and from the internal\r\nevidence of the book itself. Apologues and fables were current among\r\nthe Buddhists from the earliest times. They were ascribed to Buddha,\r\nand their sanctity increased by identifying the best character in\r\nany story with Buddha himself in a previous birth. Hence such tales\r\nwere called Jatakas, or \"Birth Stories.\" There is evidence that a\r\ncollection of stories under that name existed as early as the Council\r\nof Vesali, about 380 B.C.; and in the fifth century A.D. they assumed\r\nthe shape they now have in the Pali Sutta-pitaka. Moreover, two\r\nChinese encylopædias, the older of which was completed in 668 A.D.,\r\ncontain a large number of Indian fables translated into Chinese,\r\nand cite no fewer than 202 Buddhist works as their sources. In its\r\npresent form, however, the Panchatantra is the production of Brahmans,\r\nwho, though they transformed or omitted such parts as betrayed animus\r\nagainst Brahmanism, have nevertheless left uneffaced many traces of\r\nthe Buddhistic origin of the collection. Though now divided into only\r\nfive books, it is shown by the evidence of the oldest translation to\r\nhave at one time embraced twelve. What its original name was we cannot\r\nsay, but it may not improbably have been called after the two jackals,\r\nKarataka and Damanaka, who play a prominent part in the first book;\r\nfor the title of the old Syriac version is Kalilag and Damnag, and\r\nthat of the Arabic translation Kalilah and Dimnah.\r\n\r\nOriginally the Panchatantra was probably intended to be a manual for\r\nthe instruction of the sons of kings in the principles of conduct\r\n(niti), a kind of \"Mirror of Princes.\" For it is introduced with the\r\nstory of King Amaraçakti of Mahilaropya, a city of the south, who\r\nwishes to discover a scholar capable of training his three stupid\r\nand idle sons. He at last finds a Brahman who undertakes to teach\r\nthe princes in six months enough to make them surpass all others\r\nin knowledge of moral science. This object he duly accomplishes by\r\ncomposing the Panchatantra and reciting it to the young princes.\r\n\r\nThe framework of the first book, entitled \"Separation of Friends,\" is\r\nthe story of a bull and a lion, who are introduced to one another in\r\nthe forest by two jackals and become fast friends. One of the jackals,\r\nfeeling himself neglected, starts an intrigue by telling both the\r\nlion and the bull that each is plotting against the other. As a result\r\nthe bull is killed in battle with the lion, and the jackal, as prime\r\nminister of the latter, enjoys the fruits of his machinations. The\r\nmain story of the second book, which is called \"Acquisition of\r\nFriends,\" deals with the adventures of a tortoise, a deer, a crow,\r\nand a mouse. It is meant to illustrate the advantages of judicious\r\nfriendships. The third book, or \"The War of the Crows and the Owls,\"\r\npoints out the danger of friendship concluded between those who are old\r\nenemies. The fourth book, entitled \"Loss of what has been Acquired,\"\r\nillustrates, by the main story of the monkey and the crocodile, how\r\nfools can be made by flattery to part with their possessions. The fifth\r\nbook, entitled \"Inconsiderate Action,\" contains a number of stories\r\nconnected with the experiences of a barber, who came to grief through\r\nfailing to take all the circumstances of the case into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe book is pervaded by a quaint humour which transfers, to the animal\r\nkingdom all sorts of human action. Thus animals devote themselves\r\nto the study of the Vedas and to the practice of religious rites;\r\nthey engage in disquisitions about gods, saints, and heroes; or\r\nexchange views regarding subtle rules of ethics; but suddenly their\r\nfierce animal nature breaks out. A pious cat, for instance, called\r\nupon to act as umpire in a dispute between a sparrow and a monkey,\r\ninspires such confidence in the litigants, by a long discourse on the\r\nvanity of life and the supreme importance of virtue, that they come\r\nclose up in order to hear better the words of wisdom. In an instant he\r\nseizes one of the disputants with his claws, the other with his teeth,\r\nand devours them both. Very humorous is the story of the conceited\r\nmusical donkey. Trespassing one moonlight night in a cucumber field,\r\nhe feels impelled to sing, and answers the objections of his friend\r\nthe jackal by a lecture on the charms of music. He then begins to bray,\r\narouses the watchmen, and receives a sound drubbing.\r\n\r\nWith abundant irony and satire the most various human vices are\r\nexposed, among others the hypocrisy and avarice of Brahmans, the\r\nintriguing character of courtiers, and the faithlessness of women. A\r\nvigorous popular spirit of reaction against Brahman pretensions here\r\nfinds expression, and altogether a sound and healthy view of life\r\nprevails, forming a refreshing contrast to the exaggeration found in\r\nmany branches of Indian literature.\r\n\r\nThe following translation of a short fable from the first book may\r\nserve as a specimen of the style of the Panchatantra.\r\n\r\n\"There was in a certain forest region a herd of monkeys. Once in the\r\nwinter season, when their bodies were shivering from contact with the\r\ncold wind, and were buffeted with torrents of rain, they could find\r\nno rest. So some of the monkeys, collecting gunja berries, which are\r\nlike sparks, stood round blowing in order to obtain a fire. Now a bird\r\nnamed Needlebeak, seeing this vain endeavour of theirs, exclaimed,\r\n'Ho, you are all great fools; these are not sparks of fire, they are\r\ngunja berries. Why, therefore, this vain endeavour? You will never\r\nprotect yourselves against the cold in this way. You had better\r\nlook for a spot in the forest which is sheltered from the wind,\r\nor a cave, or a cleft in the mountains. Even now mighty rain clouds\r\nare appearing.' Thereupon an old monkey among them said, 'Ho, what\r\nbusiness of yours is this? Be off. There is a saying--\r\n\r\n\r\n    A man of judgment who desires\r\n    His own success should not accost\r\n    One constantly disturbed in work\r\n    Or gamblers who have lost at play.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd another--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who joins in conversation with\r\n    A hunter who has chased in vain,\r\n    Or with a fool who has become\r\n    Involved in ruin, comes to grief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The bird, however, without paying any attention to him, continually\r\nsaid to the monkeys, 'Ho, why this vain endeavour?' So, as he did\r\nnot for a moment cease to chatter, one of the monkeys, enraged at\r\ntheir futile efforts, seized him by the wings and dashed him against\r\na stone. And so he (de)ceased.\r\n\r\n\"Hence I say--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Unbending wood cannot be bent,\r\n    A razor cannot cut a stone:\r\n    Mark this, O Needlebeak! Try not\r\n    To lecture him who will not learn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA similar collection of fables is the celebrated Hitopadeça, or\r\n\"Salutary Advice,\" which, owing to its intrinsic merit, is one of the\r\nbest known and most popular works of Sanskrit literature in India,\r\nand which, because of its suitability for teaching purposes, is read\r\nby nearly all beginners of Sanskrit in England. It is based chiefly\r\non the Panchatantra, in which twenty-five of its forty-three fables\r\nare found. The first three books of the older collection have been,\r\nin the main, drawn upon; for there is but one story, that of the ass\r\nin the tiger's skin, taken from Book IV., and only three from Book\r\nV. The introduction is similar to that of the Panchatantra, but the\r\nfather of the ignorant and vicious princes is here called Sudarçana of\r\nPataliputra (Patna). The Hitopadeça is divided into four books. The\r\nframework and titles of the first two agree with the first two of\r\nthe Panchatantra, but in inverted order. The third and fourth books\r\nare called \"War\" and \"Peace\" respectively, the main story describing\r\nthe conflict and reconciliation of the Geese and the Peacocks.\r\n\r\nThe sententious element is here much more prominent than in the\r\nPanchatantra, and the number of verses introduced is often so great as\r\nto seriously impede the progress of the prose narrative. These verses,\r\nhowever, abound in wise maxims and fine thoughts. The stanzas dealing\r\nwith the transitoriness of human life near the end of Book IV. have\r\na peculiarly pensive beauty of their own. The following two may serve\r\nas specimens:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    As on the mighty ocean's waves\r\n    Two floating logs together come,\r\n    And, having met, for ever part:\r\n    So briefly joined are living things.\r\n\r\n    As streams of rivers onward flow,\r\n    And never more return again:\r\n    So day and night still bear away\r\n    The life of every mortal man.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain who was the author of the Hitopadeça; nor can anything\r\nmore definite be said about the date of this compilation than that\r\nit is more than 500 years old, as the earliest known MS. of it was\r\nwritten in 1373 A.D.\r\n\r\nAs both the Panchatantra and the Hitopadeça were originally intended\r\nas manuals for the instruction of kings in domestic and foreign\r\npolicy, they belong to the class of literature which the Hindus call\r\nniti-çastra, or \"Science of Political Ethics.\" A purely metrical\r\ntreatise, dealing directly with the principles of policy, is the\r\nNiti-sara, or \"Essence of Conduct.\" of Kamandaka, which is one of\r\nthe sources of the maxims introduced by the author of the Hitopadeça.\r\n\r\nA collection of pretty and ingenious fairy tales, with a highly\r\nOriental colouring, is the Vetala-panchavimçati, or \"Twenty-five Tales\r\nof the Vetala\" (a demon supposed to occupy corpses). The framework of\r\nthis collection is briefly as follows. King Vikrama of Ujjayini is\r\ndirected by an ascetic (yogin) to take down from a tree and convey\r\na corpse, without uttering a single word, to a spot in a graveyard\r\nwhere certain rites for the attainment of high magical powers are to\r\ntake place. As the king is carrying the corpse along on his shoulders,\r\na Vetala, which has entered it, begins to speak and tells him a fairy\r\ntale. On the king inadvertently replying to a question, the corpse at\r\nonce disappears and is found hanging on the tree again. The king goes\r\nback to fetch it, and the same process is repeated till the Vetala\r\nhas told twenty-five tales. Each of these is so constructed as to\r\nend in a subtle problem, on which the king is asked to express his\r\nopinion. The stories contained in this work are known to many English\r\nreaders under the title of Vikram and the Vampire.\r\n\r\nAnother collection of fairy tales is the Simhasana-dvatrimçika, or\r\n\"Thirty-two Stories of the Lion-seat\" (i.e. throne), which also goes\r\nby the name of Vikrama-charita, or \"Adventures of Vikrama.\" Here it\r\nis the throne of King Vikrama that tells the tales. Both this and\r\nthe preceding collection are of Buddhistic origin.\r\n\r\nA third work of the same kind is the Çuka-saptati, or \"Seventy Stories\r\nof a Parrot.\" Here a wife, whose husband is travelling abroad, and\r\nwho is inclined to run after other men, turns to her husband's clever\r\nparrot for advice. The bird, while seeming to approve of her plans,\r\nwarns her of the risks she runs, and makes her promise not to go and\r\nmeet any paramour unless she can extricate herself from difficulties\r\nas So-and-so did. Requested to tell the story, he does so, but only\r\nas far as the dilemma, when he asks the woman what course the person\r\nconcerned should take. As she cannot guess, the parrot promises to\r\ntell her if she stays at home that night. Seventy days pass in the\r\nsame way, till the husband returns.\r\n\r\nThese three collections of fairy tales are all written in prose and are\r\ncomparatively short. There is, however, another of special importance,\r\nwhich is composed in verse and is of very considerable length. For\r\nit contains no less than 22,000 çlokas, equal to nearly one-fourth of\r\nthe Mahabharata, or to almost twice as much as the Iliad and Odyssey\r\nput together. This is the Katha-sarit-sagara, or \"Ocean of Rivers\r\nof Stories.\" It is divided into 124 chapters, called tarangas, or\r\n\"waves,\" to be in keeping with the title of the work. Independent of\r\nthese is another division into eighteen books called lambakas.\r\n\r\nThe author was Somadeva, a Kashmirian poet, who composed his work\r\nabout 1070 A.D. Though he himself was a Brahman, his work contains\r\nnot only many traces of the Buddhistic character of his sources,\r\nbut even direct allusions to Buddhist Birth Stories. He states the\r\nreal basis of his work to have been the Brihat-katha, or \"Great\r\nNarration,\" which Bana mentions, by the poet Gunadhya, who is quoted\r\nby Dandin. This original must, in the opinion of Bühler, go back to\r\nthe first or second century A.D.\r\n\r\nA somewhat earlier recast of this work was made about A.D. 1037 by a\r\ncontemporary of Somadeva's named Kshemendra Vyasadasa. It is entitled\r\nBrihat-katha-manjari, and is only about one-third as long as the\r\nKatha-sarit-sagara. Kshemendra and Somadeva worked independently\r\nof each other, and both state that the original from which they\r\ntranslated was written in the paiçachi bhasha or \"Goblin language,\"\r\na term applied to a number of Low Prakrit dialects spoken by the most\r\nignorant and degraded classes. The Katha-sarit-sagara also contains\r\n(Tarangas 60-64) a recast of the first three books of the Panchatantra,\r\nwhich books, it is interesting to find, had the same form in Somadeva's\r\ntime as when they were translated into Pehlevi (about 570 A.D.).\r\n\r\nSomadeva's work contains many most entertaining stories; for instance,\r\nthat of the king who, through ignorance of the phonetic rules of\r\nSanskrit grammar, misunderstood a remark made by his wife, and overcome\r\nwith shame, determined to become a good Sanskrit scholar or die in\r\nthe attempt. One of the most famous tales it contains is that of King\r\nÇibi, who offered up his life to save a pigeon from a hawk. It is a\r\nJataka, and is often represented on Buddhist sculptures; for example,\r\non the tope of Amaravati, which dates from about the beginning of\r\nour era. It also occurs in a Chinese as well as a Muhammadan form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETHICAL POETRY.\r\n\r\nThe proneness of the Indian mind to reflection not only produced\r\nimportant results in religion, philosophy, and science; it also\r\nfound a more abundant expression in poetry than the literature of\r\nany other nation can boast. Scattered throughout the most various\r\ndepartments of Sanskrit literature are innumerable apophthegms in\r\nwhich wise and noble, striking and original thoughts often appear\r\nin a highly finished and poetical garb. These are plentiful in the\r\nlaw-books; in the epic and the drama they are frequently on the lips\r\nof heroes, sages, and gods; and in fables are constantly uttered by\r\ntigers, jackals, cats, and other animals. Above all, the Mahabharata,\r\nwhich, to the pious Hindu, constitutes a moral encyclopædia, is an\r\ninexhaustible mine of proverbial philosophy. It is, however, natural\r\nthat ethical maxims should be introduced in greatest abundance into\r\nworks which, like the Panchatantra and Hitopadeça, were intended to\r\nbe handbooks of practical moral philosophy.\r\n\r\nOwing to the universality of this mode of expression in Sanskrit\r\nliterature, there are but few works consisting exclusively of\r\npoetical aphorisms. The most important are the two collections by\r\nthe highly-gifted Bhartrihari, entitled respectively Nitiçataka,\r\nor \"Century of Conduct,\" and Vairagya-çataka, or \"Century\r\nof Renunciation.\" Others are the Çanti-çataka, or \"Century of\r\nTranquillity,\" by a Kashmirian poet named Çilhana; the Moha-mudgara,\r\nor \"Hammer of Folly,\" a short poem commending the relinquishment of\r\nworldly desires, and wrongly attributed to Çankaracharya; and the\r\nChanakya-çataka, the \"Centuries of Chanakya,\" the reputed author of\r\nwhich was famous in India as a master of diplomacy, and is the leading\r\ncharacter in the political drama Mudra-rakshasa. The Niti-manjari, or\r\n\"Cluster of Blossoms of Conduct,\" which has not yet been published,\r\nis a collection of a peculiar kind. The moral maxims which it contains\r\nare illustrated by stories, and these are taken exclusively from the\r\nRigveda. It consists of about 200 çlokas, and was composed by an author\r\nnamed Dya Dviveda who accompanied his work with a commentary. In the\r\nlatter he quotes largely from the Brihåddevata, Sayana on the Rigveda,\r\nand other authors.\r\n\r\nThere are also some modern anthologies of Sanskrit gnomic poetry. One\r\nof these is Çridharadasa's Sadukti-karnamrita, or \"Ear-nectar of\r\nGood Maxims,\" containing quotations from 446 poets, mostly of Bengal,\r\nand compiled in 1205 A.D. The Çarngadhara-paddhati, or \"Anthology of\r\nÇarngadhara,\" dating from the fourteenth century, comprises about 6000\r\nstanzas culled from 264 authors. The Subhashitavali, or \"Series of\r\nFine Sayings,\" compiled by Vallabhadeva, contains some 3500 stanzas\r\ntaken from about 350 poets. All that is best in Sanskrit sententious\r\npoetry has been collected by Dr. Böhtlingk, the Nestor of Indianists,\r\nin his Indische Sprüche. This work contains the text, critically edited\r\nand accompanied by a prose German translation, of nearly 8000 stanzas,\r\nwhich are culled from the whole field of classical Sanskrit literature\r\nand arranged according to the alphabetical order of the initial word.\r\n\r\nThough composed in Pali, the Dhammapada may perhaps be mentioned\r\nhere. It is a collection of aphorisms representing the most beautiful,\r\nprofound, and poetical thoughts in Buddhist literature.\r\n\r\nThe keynote prevailing in all this poetry is the doctrine of the vanity\r\nof human life, which was developed before the rise of Buddhism in the\r\nsixth century B.C., and has dominated Indian thought ever since. There\r\nis no true happiness, we are here taught, but in the abandonment of\r\ndesire and retirement from the world. The poet sees the luxuriant\r\nbeauties of nature spread before his eyes, and feels their charm;\r\nbut he turns from them sad and disappointed to seek mental calm and\r\nlasting happiness in the solitude of the forest. Hence the picture\r\nof a pious anchorite living in contemplation is often painted with\r\nenthusiasm. Free from all desires, he is as happy as a king, when the\r\nearth is his couch, his arms his pillow, the sky his tent, the moon\r\nhis lamp, when renunciation is his spouse, and the cardinal points\r\nare the maidens that fan him with winds. No Indian poet inculcates\r\nrenunciation more forcibly than Bhartrihari; the humorous and ironical\r\ntouches which he occasionally introduces are doubtless due to the\r\ncharacter of this remarkable man, who wavered between the spiritual\r\nand the worldly life throughout his career.\r\n\r\nRenunciation is not, however, the only goal to which the transitoriness\r\nof worldly goods leads the gnomic poets of India. The necessity of\r\npursuing virtue is the practical lesson which they also draw from\r\nthe vanity of mundane existence, and which finds expression in many\r\nnoble admonitions:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Transient indeed is human life,\r\n    Like the moon's disc in waters seen:\r\n    Knowing how true this is, a man\r\n    Should ever practise what is good (Hit. iv. 133).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is often said that when a man dies and leaves all his loved ones\r\nbehind, his good works alone can accompany him on his journey to his\r\nnext life. Nor should sin ever be committed in this life when there\r\nis none to see, for it is always witnessed by the \"old hermit dwelling\r\nin the heart,\" as the conscience is picturesquely called.\r\n\r\nThat spirit of universal tolerance and love of mankind which enabled\r\nBuddhism to overstep the bounds not only of caste but of nationality,\r\nand thus to become the earliest world-religion, breathes throughout\r\nthis poetry. Even the Mahabharata, though a work of the Brahmans,\r\ncontains such liberal sentiments as this:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Men of high rank win no esteem\r\n    If lacking in good qualities;\r\n    A Çudra even deserves respect\r\n    Who knows and does his duty well (xiii. 2610).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following stanza shows how cosmopolitan Bhartrihari was in his\r\nviews:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"This man's our own, a stranger that\":\r\n    Thus narrow-minded people think.\r\n    However, noble-minded men\r\n    Regard the whole world as their kin.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut these poets go even beyond the limits of humanity and inculcate\r\nsympathy with the joys and sorrows of all creatures:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    To harm no living thing in deed,\r\n    In thought or word, to exercise\r\n    Benevolence and charity:\r\n    Virtue's eternal law is this (Mahabh. xii. 5997).\r\n\r\n\r\nGentleness and forbearance towards good and bad alike are thus\r\nrecommended in the Hitopadeça:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Even to beings destitute\r\n    Of virtue good men pity show:\r\n    The moon does not her light withdraw\r\n    Even from the pariah's abode (i. 63).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Panchatantra, again, dissuades thus from thoughts of revenge:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Devise no ill at any time\r\n    To injure those that do thee harm:\r\n    They of themselves will some day fall,\r\n    Like trees that grow on river banks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good qualities of the virtuous are often described and contrasted\r\nwith the characteristics of evil-doers. This, for instance, is how\r\nBhartrihari illustrates the humility of the benevolent:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The trees bend downward with the burden of their fruit,\r\n    The clouds bow low, heavy with waters they will shed:\r\n    The noble hold not high their heads through pride of wealth;\r\n    Thus those behave who are on others' good intent (i. 71).\r\n\r\n\r\nMany fine thoughts about true friendship and the value of intercourse\r\nwith good men are found here, often exemplified in a truly poetical\r\nspirit. This, for instance, is from the Panchatantra:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who is not made a better man\r\n    By contact with a noble friend?\r\n    A water-drop on lotus-leaves\r\n    Assumes the splendour of a pearl (iii. 61).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps natural that poetry with a strong pessimistic\r\ncolouring should contain many bitter sayings about women and their\r\ncharacter. Here is an example of how they are often described:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    The love of women but a moment lasts.\r\n    Like colours of the dawn or evening red;\r\n    Their aims are crooked like a river's course;\r\n    Inconstant are they as the lightning flash;\r\n    Like serpents, they deserve no confidence (Kathas. xxxvii. 143).\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time there are several passages in which female character\r\nis represented in a more favourable light, and others sing the praise\r\nof faithful wives.\r\n\r\nHere, too, we meet with many pithy sayings about the misery of poverty\r\nand the degradation of servitude; while the power of money to invest\r\nthe worthless man with the appearance of every talent and virtue is\r\ndescribed with bitter irony and scathing sarcasm.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, true knowledge receives frequent and high\r\nappreciation in Sanskrit ethical poetry. It is compared with a\r\nrich treasure which cannot be divided among relations, which no\r\nthief can steal, and which is never diminished by being imparted to\r\nothers. Contempt, on the other hand, is poured on pedantry and spurious\r\nlearning. Those who have read many books, without understanding their\r\nsense, are likened to an ass laden with sandal wood, who feels only\r\nthe weight, but knows nothing of the value of his burden.\r\n\r\nAs the belief in transmigration has cast its shadow over Indian thought\r\nfrom pre-Buddhistic times, it is only natural that the conception\r\nof fate should be prominent in Sanskrit moral poetry. Here, indeed,\r\nwe often read that no one can escape from the operation of destiny,\r\nbut at the same time we find constant admonitions not to let this\r\nfact paralyse human effort. For, as is shown in the Hitopadeça and\r\nelsewhere, fate is nothing else than the result of action done in a\r\nformer birth. Hence every man can by right conduct shape his future\r\nfate, just as a potter can mould a lump of clay into whatever form\r\nhe desires. Human action is thus a necessary complement to fate;\r\nthe latter cannot proceed without the former any more than a cart,\r\nas the Hitopadeça expresses it, can move with only one wheel. This\r\ndoctrine is inculcated with many apt illustrations. Thus in one\r\nstanza of the Hitopadeça it is pointed out that \"antelopes do not\r\nenter into the mouth of the sleeping lion\"; in another the question\r\nis asked, \"Who without work could obtain oil from sesamum seeds?\" Or,\r\nas the Mahabharata once puts it, fate without human action cannot be\r\nfulfilled, just as seed sown outside the field bears no fruit.\r\n\r\nFor those who are suffering from the assaults of adverse fate there\r\nare many exhortations to firmness and constancy. The following is a\r\nstanza of this kind from the Panchatantra:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    In fortune and calamity\r\n    The great ever remain the same:\r\n    The sun is at its rising red,\r\n    Red also when about to set.\r\n\r\n\r\nCollected in the ethico-didactic works which have been described in\r\nthis chapter, and scattered throughout the rest of the literature,\r\nthe notions held by the Brahmans in the sphere of moral philosophy\r\nhave never received a methodical treatment, as in the Pali literature\r\nof Buddhism. In the orthodox systems of Hindu philosophy, to which\r\nwe now turn, they find no place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of Indian philosophy, which are to be found in the\r\nlatest hymns of the Rigveda and in the Atharvaveda, are concerned with\r\nspeculations on the origin of the world and on the eternal principle\r\nby which it is created and maintained. The Yajurveda further contains\r\nfantastic cosmogonic legends describing how the Creator produces all\r\nthings by means of the omnipotent sacrifice. With these Vedic ideas\r\nare intimately connected, and indeed largely identical, those of the\r\nearlier Upanishads. This philosophy is essentially pantheistic and\r\nidealistic. By the side of it grew up an atheistic and empirical school\r\nof thought, which in the sixth century B.C. furnished the foundation\r\nof the two great unorthodox religious systems of Buddhism and Jainism.\r\n\r\nThe Upanishad philosophy is in a chaotic condition, but\r\nthe speculations of this and of other schools of thought were\r\ngradually reduced to order and systematised in manuals from about\r\nthe first century of our era onwards. Altogether nine systems may\r\nbe distinguished, some of which must in their origin go back to the\r\nbeginning of the sixth century B.C. at least. Of the six systems which\r\nare accounted orthodox no less than four were originally atheistic,\r\nand one remained so throughout. The strangeness of this fact disappears\r\nwhen we reflect that the only conditions of orthodoxy in India were\r\nthe recognition of the class privileges of the Brahman caste and\r\na nominal acknowledgment of the infallibility of the Veda, neither\r\nfull agreement with Vedic doctrines nor the confession of a belief in\r\nthe existence of God being required. With these two limitations the\r\nutmost freedom of thought prevailed in Brahmanism. Hence the boldest\r\nphilosophical speculation and conformity with the popular religion\r\nwent hand and hand, to a degree which has never been equalled in any\r\nother country. Of the orthodox systems, by far the most important\r\nare the pantheistic Vedanta, which, as continuing the doctrines of\r\nthe Upanishads, has been the dominant philosophy of Brahmanism since\r\nthe end of the Vedic period, and the atheistic Sankhya, which, for\r\nthe first time in the history of the world, asserted the complete\r\nindependence of the human mind and attempted to solve its problems\r\nsolely by the aid of reason.\r\n\r\nOn the Sankhya were based the two heterodox religious systems of\r\nBuddhism and Jainism, which denied the authority of the Veda, and\r\nopposed the Brahman caste system and ceremonial. Still more heterodox\r\nwas the Materialist philosophy of Charvaka, which went further and\r\ndenied even the fundamental doctrines common to all other schools of\r\nIndian thought, orthodox and unorthodox, the belief in transmigration\r\ndependent on retribution, and the belief in salvation or release\r\nfrom transmigration.\r\n\r\nThe theory that every individual passes after death into a series\r\nof new existences in heavens or hells, or in the bodies of men and\r\nanimals, or in plants on earth, where it is rewarded or punished for\r\nall deeds committed in a former life, was already so firmly established\r\nin the sixth century B.C., that Buddha received it without question\r\ninto his religious system; and it has dominated the belief of the\r\nIndian people from those early times down to the present day. There\r\nis, perhaps, no more remarkable fact in the history of the human mind\r\nthan that this strange doctrine, never philosophically demonstrated,\r\nshould have been regarded as self-evident for 2500 years by every\r\nphilosophical school or religious sect in India, excepting only the\r\nMaterialists. By the acceptance of this doctrine the Vedic optimism,\r\nwhich looked forward to a life of eternal happiness in heaven, was\r\ntransformed into the gloomy prospect of an interminable series of\r\nmiserable existences leading from one death to another. The transition\r\nto the developed view of the Upanishads is to be found in the Çatapatha\r\nBrahmana (above, p. 223).\r\n\r\nHow is the origin of the momentous doctrine which produced this change\r\nto be accounted for? The Rigveda contains no traces of it beyond a\r\ncouple of passages in the last book which speak of the soul of a dead\r\nman as going to the waters or plants. It seems hardly likely that\r\nso far-reaching a theory should have been developed from the stray\r\nfancies of one or two later Vedic poets. It seems more probable that\r\nthe Aryan settlers received the first impulse in this direction from\r\nthe aboriginal inhabitants of India. As is well known, there is among\r\nhalf-savage tribes a wide-spread belief that the soul after death\r\npasses into the trunks of trees and the bodies of animals. Thus the\r\nSonthals of India are said even at the present day to hold that the\r\nsouls of the good enter into fruit-bearing trees. But among such\r\nraces the notion of transmigration does not go beyond a belief\r\nin the continuance of human existence in animals and trees. If,\r\ntherefore, the Aryan Indians borrowed the idea from the aborigines,\r\nthey certainly deserve the credit of having elaborated out of it\r\nthe theory of an unbroken chain of existences, intimately connected\r\nwith the moral principle of requïtal. The immovable hold it acquired\r\non Indian thought is doubtless due to the satisfactory explanation\r\nit offered of the misfortune or prosperity which is often clearly\r\ncaused by no action done in this life. Indeed, the Indian doctrine of\r\ntransmigration, fantastic though it may appear to us, has the twofold\r\nmerit of satisfying the requirement of justice in the moral government\r\nof the world, and at the same time inculcating a valuable ethical\r\nprinciple which makes every man the architect of his own fate. For,\r\nas every bad deed done in this existence must be expiated, so every\r\ngood deed will be rewarded in the next existence. From the enjoyment\r\nof the fruits of actions already done there is no escape; for, in the\r\nwords of the Mahabharata, \"as among a thousand cows a calf finds its\r\nmother, so the deed previously done follows after the doer.\"\r\n\r\nThe cycle of existences (samsara) is regarded as having no beginning,\r\nfor as every event of the present life is the result of an action done\r\nin a past one, the same must hold true of each preceding existence\r\nad infinitum. The subsequent effectiveness of guilt and of merit,\r\ncommonly called adrishta or \"the unseen,\" but often also simply karma,\r\n\"deed or work,\" is believed to regulate not only the life of the\r\nindividual, but the origin and development of everything in the world;\r\nfor whatever takes place cannot but affect some creature, and must\r\ntherefore, by the law of retribution, be due to some previous act of\r\nthat creature. In other words, the operations of nature are also the\r\nresults of the good or bad deeds of living beings. There is thus no\r\nroom for independent divine rule by the side of the power of karma,\r\nwhich governs everything with iron necessity. Hence, even the systems\r\nwhich acknowledge a God can only assign to him the function of guiding\r\nthe world and the life of creatures in strict accordance with the law\r\nof retribution, which even he cannot break. The periodic destruction\r\nand renewal of the universe, an application of the theory on a grand\r\nscale, forms part of the doctrine of samsara or cycle of existence.\r\n\r\nCommon to all the systems of philosophy, and as old as that of\r\ntransmigration, is the doctrine of salvation, which puts an end\r\nto transmigration. All action is brought about by desire, which,\r\nin its turn is based on avidya, a sort of \"ignorance,\" that\r\nmistakes the true nature of things, and is the ultimate source\r\nof transmigration. Originally having only the negative sense of\r\nnon-knowledge (a-vidya), the word here came to have the positive\r\nsense of \"false knowledge.\" Such ignorance is dispelled by saving\r\nknowledge, which, according to every philosophical school of India,\r\nconsists in some special form of cognition. This universal knowledge,\r\nwhich is not the result of merit, but breaks into life independently,\r\ndestroys, the subsequent effect of works which would otherwise bear\r\nfruit in future existences, and thus puts an end to transmigration. It\r\ncannot, however, influence those works the fruit of which has already\r\nbegun to ripen. Hence, the present life continues from the moment of\r\nenlightenment till definite salvation at death, just as the potter's\r\nwheel goes on revolving for a time after the completion of the pot. But\r\nno merit or demerit results from acts done after enlightenment (or\r\n\"conversion\" as we should say), because all desire for the objects\r\nof the world is at an end.\r\n\r\nThe popular beliefs about heavens and hells, gods, demi-gods, and\r\ndemons, were retained in Buddhism and Jainism, as well as in the\r\northodox systems. But these higher and more fortunate beings were\r\nconsidered to be also subject to the law of transmigration, and,\r\nunless they obtained saving knowledge, to be on a lower level than\r\nthe man who had obtained such knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe monistic theory of the early Upanishads, which identified\r\nthe individual soul with Brahma, aroused the opposition of the\r\nrationalistic founder of the Sankhya system, Kapila, who, according\r\nto Buddhist legends, was pre-Buddhistic, and whose doctrines Buddha\r\nfollowed and elaborated. His teaching is entirely dualistic, admitting\r\nonly two things, both without beginning and end, but essentially\r\ndifferent, matter on the one hand, and an infinite plurality of\r\nindividual souls on the other. An account of the nature and the mutual\r\nrelation of these two, forms the main content of the system. Kapila\r\nwas, indeed, the first who drew a sharp line of demarcation between\r\nthe two domains of matter and soul. The saving knowledge which\r\ndelivers from the misery of transmigration consists, according to the\r\nSankhya system, in recognising the absolute distinction between soul\r\nand matter.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a supreme god who creates and rules the universe is\r\ndenied, and would be irreconcilable with the system. For according\r\nto its doctrine the unconscious matter of Nature originally contains\r\nwithin itself the power of evolution (in the interest of souls,\r\nwhich are entirely passive during the process), while karma alone\r\ndetermines the course of that evolution. The adherents of the system\r\ndefend their atheism by maintaining that the origin of misery presents\r\nan insoluble problem to the theist, for a god who has created and\r\nrules the world could not possibly escape from the reproach of cruelty\r\nand partiality. Much stress is laid by this school in general on the\r\nabsence of any cogent proof for the existence of God.\r\n\r\nThe world is maintained to be real, and that from all eternity; for\r\nthe existent can only be produced from the existent. The reality of\r\nan object is regarded as resulting simply from perception, always\r\nsupposing the senses of the perceiver to be sound. The world is\r\ndescribed as developing according to certain laws out of primitive\r\nmatter (prakriti or pradhana). The genuine philosophic spirit of\r\nits method of rising from the known elements of experience to the\r\nunknown by logical demonstration till the ultimate cause is reached,\r\nmust give this system a special interest in the eyes of evolutionists\r\nwhose views are founded on the results of modern physical science.\r\n\r\nThe evolution and diversity of the world are explained by primæval\r\nmatter, although uniform and indivisible, consisting of three different\r\nsubstances called gunas or constituents (originally \"strands\" of a\r\nrope). By the combination of these in varying proportions the diverse\r\nmaterial products were supposed to have arisen. The constituent,\r\ncalled sattva, distinguished by the qualities of luminousness and\r\nlightness in the object, and by virtue, benevolence, and other pleasing\r\nattributes in the subject, is associated with the feeling of joy;\r\nrajas, distinguished by activity and various hurtful qualities, is\r\nassociated with pain; and tamas, distinguished by heaviness, rigidity,\r\nand darkness on the one hand, and fear, unconsciousness, and so forth,\r\non the other, is associated with apathy. At the end of a cosmic period\r\nall things are supposed to be dissolved into primitive matter, the\r\nalternations of evolution, existence, and dissolution having neither\r\nbeginning nor end.\r\n\r\nThe psychology of the Sankhya system is specially important. Peculiarly\r\ninteresting is its doctrine that all mental operations, such as\r\nperception, thinking, willing, are not performed by the soul, but are\r\nmerely mechanical processes of the internal organs, that is to say,\r\nof matter. The soul itself possesses no attributes or qualities,\r\nand can only be described negatively. There being no qualitative\r\ndifference between souls, the principle of personality and identity\r\nis supplied by the subtile or internal body, which, chiefly formed of\r\nthe inner organs and the senses, surrounds and is made conscious by the\r\nsoul. This internal body, being the vehicle of merit and demerit, which\r\nare the basis of transmigration, accompanies the soul on its wanderings\r\nfrom one gross body to another, whether the latter be that of a god,\r\na man, an animal, or a tree. Conscious life is bondage to pain, in\r\nwhich pleasure is included by this peculiarly pessimistic system. When\r\nsalvation, which is the absolute cessation of pain, is obtained,\r\nthe internal body is dissolved into its material elements, and the\r\nsoul, becoming finally isolated, continues to exist individually,\r\nbut in absolute unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThe name of the system, which only begins to be mentioned in the\r\nlater Upanishads, and more frequently in the Mahabharata, is derived\r\nfrom samkhya, \"number.\" There is, however, some doubt as to whether\r\nit originally meant \"enumeration,\" from the twenty-five tattvas or\r\nprinciples which it sets forth, or \"inferential or discriminative\"\r\ndoctrine, from the method which it pursues.\r\n\r\nKapila, the founder of the system, whose teaching is presupposed\r\nby Buddhism, and whom Buddhistic legend connects with Kapila-vastu,\r\nthe birthplace of Buddha, must have lived before the middle of the\r\nsixth century. No work of his, if he ever committed his system to\r\nwriting, has been preserved. Indeed, the very existence of such a\r\nperson as Kapila has been doubted, in spite of the unanimity with\r\nwhich Indian tradition designates a man of this name as the founder\r\nof the system. The second leading authority of the Sankhya philosophy\r\nwas Panchaçikha, who may have lived about the beginning of our era. The\r\noldest systematic manual which has been preserved is the Sankhya-karika\r\nof Içvara-krishna. As it was translated into Chinese between 557 and\r\n583 A.D., it cannot belong to a later century than the fifth, and\r\nmay be still older. This work deals very concisely and methodically\r\nwith the doctrines of the Sankhya in sixty-nine stanzas (composed in\r\nthe complicated Arya metre), to which three others were subsequently\r\nadded. It appears to have superseded the Sutras of Panchaçikha, who\r\nis mentioned in it as the chief disseminator of the system. There are\r\ntwo excellent commentaries on the Sankhya-karika, the one composed\r\nabout 700 A.D. by Gaudapada, and the other soon after 1100 A.D. by\r\nVachaspati Miçra.\r\n\r\nThe Sankhya Sutras, long regarded as the oldest manual of the\r\nsystem, and attributed to Kapila, were probably not composed till\r\nabout 1400 A.D. The author of this work, which also goes by the\r\nname of Sankhya-pravachana, endeavours in vain to show that there\r\nis no difference between the doctrines of the Sankhya and of the\r\nUpanishads. He is also much influenced by the ideas of the Yoga as well\r\nas the Vedanta system. In the oldest commentary on this work, that of\r\nAniruddha, composed about 1500 A.D., the objectiveness of the treatment\r\nis particularly useful. Much more detailed, but far less objective, is\r\nthe commentary of Vijnana-bhikshu, entitled Sankhya-pravachana-bhashya,\r\nand written in the second half of the sixteenth century. The author's\r\npoint of view being theistic, he effaces the characteristic features\r\nof the different systems in the endeavour to show that all the six\r\northodox systems contain the absolute truth in their main doctrines.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of our era down to recent times the Sankhya\r\ndoctrines have exercised considerable influence on the religious\r\nand philosophical life of India, though to a much less extent than\r\nthe Vedanta. Some of its individual teachings, such as that of the\r\nthree gunas, have become the common property of the whole of Sanskrit\r\nliterature. At the time of the great Vedantist, Çankara (800 A.D.),\r\nthe Sankhya system was held in high honour. The law book of Manu\r\nfollowed this doctrine, though with an admixture of the theistic\r\nnotions of the Mimamsa and Vedanta systems as well as of popular\r\nmythology. The Mahabharata, especially Book XII., is full of Sankhya\r\ndoctrines; indeed almost every detail of the teachings of this system\r\nis to be found somewhere in the great epic. Its numerous deviations\r\nfrom the regular Sankhya text-books are only secondary, as Professor\r\nGarbe thinks, even though the Mahabharata is our oldest actual source\r\nfor the system. Nearly half the Puranas follow the cosmogony of the\r\nSankhya, and even those which are Vedantic are largely influenced\r\nby its doctrines. The purity of the Sankhya notions are, however,\r\neverywhere in the Puranas obscured by Vedanta doctrines, especially\r\nthat of cosmical illusion. A peculiarity of the Puranic Sankhya is the\r\nconception of Spirit or Purusha as the male, and Matter or Prakriti\r\nas the female, principle in creation.\r\n\r\nOn the Sankhya system are based the two philosophical religions of\r\nBuddhism and Jainism in all their main outlines. Their fundamental\r\ndoctrine is that life is nothing but suffering. The cause of suffering\r\nis the desire, based on ignorance, to live and enjoy the world. The aim\r\nof both is to redeem mankind from the misery of mundane existence by\r\nthe annihilation of desire, with the aid of renunciation of the world\r\nand the practice of unbounded kindness towards all creatures. These\r\ntwo pessimistic religions are so extremely similar that the Jainas, or\r\nadherents of Jina, were long looked upon as a Buddhist sect. Research\r\nhas, however, led to the discovery that the founders of both systems\r\nwere contemporaries, the most eminent of the many teachers who in the\r\nsixth century opposed the Brahman ceremonial and caste pretensions\r\nin Northern Central India. Both religions, while acknowledging the\r\nlower and ephemeral gods of Brahmanism, deny, like the Sankhya,\r\nthe existence of an eternal supreme Deity. As they developed, they\r\ndiverged in various respects from the system to which they owed\r\ntheir philosophical notions. Hence it came about that Sankhya writers\r\nstoutly opposed some of their teachings, particularly the Buddhist\r\ndenial of soul, the doctrine that all things have only a momentary\r\nexistence, and that salvation is an annihilation of self. Here,\r\nhowever, it should be noted that Buddha himself refused to decide the\r\nquestion whether nirvana is complete extinction or an unending state\r\nof unconscious bliss. The latter view was doubtless a concession to\r\nthe Vedantic conception of Brahma, in which the individual soul is\r\nmerged on attaining salvation.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these systems lies not in their metaphysical\r\nspeculations, which occupy but a subordinate position, but in their\r\nhigh development of moral principles, which are almost entirely\r\nneglected in the orthodox systems of Indian philosophy. The fate of\r\nthe two religions has been strangely different. Jainism has survived\r\nas an insignificant sect in India alone; Buddhism has long since\r\nvanished from the land of its birth, but has become a world religion\r\ncounting more adherents than any other faith.\r\n\r\nThe Sankhya philosophy, with the addition of a peculiar form of mental\r\nasceticism as the most effective means of acquiring saving knowledge,\r\nappears to have assumed definite shape in a manual at an earlier period\r\nthan any of the other orthodox systems. This is the Yoga philosophy\r\nfounded by Patanjali and expounded in the Yoga Sutras. The priority\r\nof this text-book is rendered highly probable by the fact that it is\r\nthe only philosophical Sutra work which contains no polemics against\r\nthe others. There seems, moreover, to be no sufficient ground to doubt\r\nthe correctness of the native tradition identifying the founder of the\r\nYoga system with the grammarian Patanjali. The Yoga Sutras therefore\r\nprobably date from the second century B.C. This work also goes by\r\nthe name of Sankhya-pravachana, the same as that given to the later\r\nSankhya Sutras, a sufficiently clear proof of its close connection\r\nwith Kapila's philosophy. In the Mahabharata the two systems are\r\nactually spoken of as one and the same.\r\n\r\nIn order to make his system more acceptable, Patanjali introduced into\r\nit the doctrine of a personal god, but in so loose a way as not to\r\naffect the system as a whole. Indeed, the parts of the Sutras dealing\r\nwith the person of God are not only unconnected with the other parts of\r\nthe treatise, but even contradict the foundations of the system. For\r\nthe final aim of man is here represented as the absolute isolation\r\n(kaivalya) of the soul from matter, just as in the Sankhya system,\r\nand not union with or absorption in God. Nor are the individual souls\r\nhere derived from the \"special soul\" or God, but are like the latter\r\nwithout a beginning.\r\n\r\nThe really distinctive part of the system is the establishment of the\r\nviews prevailing in Patanjali's time with regard to asceticism and the\r\nmysterious powers to be acquired by its practice. Yoga, or \"yoking\"\r\nthe mind, means mental concentration on a particular object. The\r\nbelief that fasting and other penances produce supernatural powers\r\ngoes back to remote prehistoric times, and still prevails among savage\r\nraces. Bodily asceticism of this kind is known to the Vedas under the\r\nname of tapas. From this, with the advance of intellectual life in\r\nIndia, was developed the practice of mental asceticism called yoga,\r\nwhich must have been known and practised several centuries before\r\nPatanjali's time. For recent investigations have shown that Buddhism\r\nstarted not only from the theoretical Sankhya but from the practical\r\nYoga doctrine; and the condition of ecstatic abstraction was from\r\nthe beginning held in high esteem among the Buddhists. Patanjali only\r\nelaborated the doctrine, describing at length the means of attaining\r\nconcentration and carrying it to the highest pitch. In his system the\r\nmethodical practice of Yoga acquired a special importance; for, in\r\naddition to conferring supernatural powers, it here becomes the chief\r\nmeans of salvation. His Sutras consist of four chapters dealing with\r\ndeep meditation (samadhi), the means for obtaining it (sadhana), the\r\nmiraculous powers (vibhuti) it confers, and the isolation (kaivalya)\r\nof the redeemed soul. The oldest and best commentary on this work is\r\nthat of Vyasa, dating from the seventh century A.D.\r\n\r\nMany of the later Upanishads are largely concerned with the Yoga\r\ndoctrine. The lawbook of Manu in Book VI. refers to various details\r\nof Yoga practice. Indeed, it seems likely, owing to the theistic\r\npoint of view of that work, that its Sankhya notions were derived\r\nfrom the Yoga system. The Mahabharata treats of Yoga in considerable\r\ndetail, especially in Book XII. It is particularly prominent in\r\nthe Bhagavadgita, which is even designated a yoga-çastra. Belief\r\nin the efficacy of Yoga still prevails in India, and its practice\r\nsurvives. But its adherents, the Yogis, are at the present day often\r\nnothing more than conjurers and jugglers.\r\n\r\nThe exercises of mental concentration are in the later commentaries\r\ndistinguished by the name of raja-yoga or \"chief Yoga.\" The external\r\nexpedients are called kriya-yoga, or \"practical Yoga.\" The more\r\nintense form of the latter, in later works called hatha-yoga, or\r\n\"forcible Yoga,\" and dealing for the most part with suppression of\r\nthe breath, is very often contrasted with raja-yoga.\r\n\r\nAmong the eight branches of Yoga practice the sitting posture (asana),\r\nas not only conducive to concentration, but of therapeutic value,\r\nis considered important. In describing its various forms later\r\nwriters positively revelled, eighty-four being frequently stated to\r\nbe their normal number. In the hatha-yoga there are also a number of\r\nother postures and contortions of the limbs designated mudra. The\r\nbest-known mudra, called khechari, consists in turning the tongue\r\nback towards the throat and keeping the gaze fixed on a point between\r\nthe eyebrows. Such practices, in conjunction with the suppression of\r\nbreath, were capable of producing a condition of trance. There is at\r\nleast the one well-authenticated case of a Yogi named Haridas who in\r\nthe thirties wandered about in Rajputana and Lahore, allowing himself\r\nto be buried for money when in the cataleptic condition. The burial\r\nof the Master of Ballantrae by the Indian Secundra Dass in Stevenson's\r\nnovel was doubtless suggested by an account of this ascetic.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the two older and intimately connected dualistic\r\nschools of the Sankhya and Yoga, there arose about the beginning of\r\nour era the only two, even of the six orthodox systems of philosophy,\r\nwhich were theistic from the outset. One of them, being based on\r\nthe Vedas and the Brahmanas, is concerned with the practical side\r\nof Vedic religion; while the other, alone among the philosophical\r\nsystems, represents a methodical development of the fundamental\r\nnon-dualistic speculations of the Upanishads. The former, which has\r\nonly been accounted a philosophical system at all because of its\r\nclose connection with the latter, is the Purva-mimamsa or \"First\r\nInquiry,\" also called Karma-mimamsa or \"Inquiry concerning Works,\"\r\nbut usually simply Mimamsa. Founded by Jaimini, and set forth in the\r\nKarma-mimamsa Sutras, this system discusses the sacred ceremonies and\r\nthe rewards resulting from their performance. Holding the Veda to be\r\nuncreated and existent from all eternity, it lays special stress on the\r\nproposition that articulate sounds are eternal, and on the consequent\r\ndoctrine that the connection of a word with its sense is not due to\r\nconvention, but is by nature inherent in the word itself. Owing to\r\nits lack of philosophical interest, this system has not as yet much\r\noccupied the attention of European scholars.\r\n\r\nThe oldest commentary in existence on the Mimamsa Sutras is the\r\nbhashya of Çabara Svamin, which in its turn was commented on about 700\r\nA.D. by the great Mimamsist Kumarila in his Tantra-varttika and in his\r\nÇloka-varttika, the latter a metrical paraphrase of Çabara's exposition\r\nof the first aphorism of Patanjali. Among the later commentaries on the\r\nMimamsa Sutras the most important is the Jaiminiya-nyaya-mala-vistara\r\nof Madhava (fourteenth century).\r\n\r\nFar more deserving of attention is the theoretical system of the\r\nUttara-Mimamsa, or \"Second Inquiry.\" For it not only systematises\r\nthe doctrines of the Upanishads--therefore usually termed Vedanta,\r\nor \"End of the Veda\"--but also represents the philosophical views of\r\nthe Indian thinkers of to-day. In the words of Professor Deussen,\r\nits relation to the earlier Upanishads resembles that of Christian\r\ndogmatics to the New Testament. Its fundamental doctrine, expressed\r\nin the famous formula tat tvam asi, \"thou art that,\" is the identity\r\nof the individual soul with God (brahma). Hence it is also called\r\nthe Brahma- or Çariraka-mimamsa, \"Inquiry concerning Brahma or the\r\nembodied soul.\" The eternal and infinite Brahma not being made up of\r\nparts or liable to change, the individual soul, it is here laid down,\r\ncannot be a part or emanation of it, but is the whole indivisible\r\nBrahma. As there is no other existence but Brahma, the Vedanta\r\nis styled the advaita-vada, or \"doctrine of non-duality,\" being,\r\nin other words, an idealistic monism. The evidence of experience,\r\nwhich shows a multiplicity of phenomena, and the statements of the\r\nVeda, which teach a multiplicity of souls, are brushed aside as the\r\nphantasms of a dream which are only true till waking takes place.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate cause of all such false impressions is avidya or innate\r\nignorance, which this, like the other systems, simply postulates, but\r\ndoes not in any way seek to account for. It is this ignorance which\r\nprevents the soul from recognising that the empirical world is mere\r\nmaya or illusion. Thus to the Vedantist the universe is like a mirage,\r\nwhich the soul under the influence of desire (trishna or \"thirst\")\r\nfancies it perceives, just as the panting hart sees before it sheets\r\nof water in the fata morgana (picturesquely called mriga-trishna or\r\n\"deer-thirst\" in Sanskrit). The illusion vanishes as if by magic,\r\nwhen the scales fall from the eyes, on the acquisition of true\r\nknowledge. Then the semblance of any distinction between the soul\r\nand God disappears, and salvation (moksha), the chief end of man,\r\nis attained.\r\n\r\nSaving knowledge cannot of course be acquired by worldly experience,\r\nbut is revealed in the theoretical part (jnana-kanda) of the Vedas,\r\nthat is to say, in the Upanishads. By this correct knowledge the\r\nillusion of the multiplicity of phenomena is dispelled, just as the\r\nillusion of a snake when there is only a rope. Two forms of knowledge\r\nare, however, distinguished in the Vedanta, a higher (para) and a lower\r\n(apara). The former is concerned with the higher and impersonal Brahma\r\n(neuter), which is without form or attributes, while the latter deals\r\nwith the lower and personal Brahma (masculine), who is the soul of\r\nthe universe, the Lord (içvara) who has created the world and grants\r\nsalvation. The contradiction resulting from one and the same thing\r\nhaving form and no form, attributes and no attributes, is solved by\r\nthe explanation that the lower Brahma has no reality, but is merely\r\nan illusory form of the higher and only Brahma, produced by ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of the Vedanta are laid down in the Brahma-sutras of\r\nBadarayana. This text-book, the meaning of which is not intelligible\r\nwithout the aid of a commentary, was expounded in his bhashya by\r\nthe famous Vedantist philosopher Çankara, whose name is intimately\r\nconnected with the revival of Brahmanism. He was born in 788 A.D.,\r\nbecame an ascetic in 820, and probably lived to an advanced age. There\r\nis every likelihood that his expositions agree in all essentials with\r\nthe meaning of the Brahma-sutras, The full elaboration of the doctrine\r\nof Maya, or cosmic illusion, is, however, due to him. An excellent\r\nepitome of the teachings of the Vedanta, as set forth by Çankara,\r\nis the Vedanta-sara of Sadananda Yogindra. Its author departs from\r\nÇankara's views only in a few particulars, which show an admixture\r\nof Sankhya doctrine.\r\n\r\nAmong the many commentaries on the Brahma-sutras subsequent to\r\nÇankara, the most important is that of Ramanuja, who lived in the\r\nearlier half of the twelfth century. This writer gives expression to\r\nthe views of the Pancharatras or Bhagavatas, an old Vishnuite sect,\r\nwhose doctrine, closely allied to Christian ideas, is expounded in\r\nthe Bhagavadgita and the Bhagavata-purana, as well as in the special\r\ntext-books of the sect. The tenets of the Bhagavatas, as set forth\r\nby Ramanuja, diverge considerably from those of the Brahma-sutras\r\non which he is commenting. For, according to him, individual souls\r\nare not identical with God; they suffer from innate unbelief, not\r\nignorance, while belief or the love of God (bhakti), not knowledge,\r\nis the means of salvation or union with God.\r\n\r\nThe last two orthodox systems of philosophy, the Vaiçeshika and the\r\nNyaya, form a closely-connected pair, since a strict classification\r\nof ideas, as well as the explanation of the origin of the world from\r\natoms, is common to both. Much the older of the two is the Vaiçeshika,\r\nwhich is already assailed in the Brahma-sutras. It is there described\r\nas undeserving of attention, because it had no adherents. This was\r\ncertainly not the case in later times, when this system became very\r\npopular. It received its name from the category of \"particularity\"\r\n(viçesha) on which great stress is laid in its theory of atoms. The\r\nmemory of its founder is only preserved in his nickname Kanada (also\r\nKanabhuj or Kana-bhaksha), which means \"atom-eater.\"\r\n\r\nThe main importance of the system lies in the logical categories\r\nwhich it set up and under which it classed all phenomena. The six\r\nwhich it originally set up are substance, quality, motion, generality,\r\nparticularity, and inherence. They are rigorously defined and further\r\nsubdivided. The most interesting is that of inherence or inseparable\r\nconnection (samavaya), which, being clearly distinguished from that\r\nof accident or separable connection (samyoga), is described as the\r\nrelation between a thing and its properties, the whole and its parts,\r\ngenus and species, motion and the object in motion. Later was added a\r\nseventh, that of non-existence (abhava), which, by affording special\r\nfacilities for the display of subtlety, has had a momentous influence\r\non Indian logic. This category was further subdivided into prior and\r\nposterior non-existence (which we should respectively call future and\r\npast existence), mutual non-existence (as between a jar and cloth),\r\nand absolute non-existence (as fire in water).\r\n\r\nThough largely concerned with these categories, the Vaiçeshika system\r\naimed at attaining a comprehensive philosophic view in connection\r\nwith them. Thus while dealing with the category of \"substance,\"\r\nit develops its theory of the origin of the world from atoms. The\r\nconsideration of the category of \"quality\" similarly leads to its\r\ntreatment of psychology, which is remarkable and has analogies with\r\nthat of the Sankhya. Soul is here regarded as without beginning\r\nor end, and all-pervading, subject to the limitations of neither\r\ntime nor space. Intimately connected with soul is \"mind\" (manas),\r\nthe internal organ of thought, which alone enables the soul to know\r\nnot only external objects but its own qualities. As this organ is, in\r\ncontrast with soul, an atom, it can only comprehend a single object\r\nat any given moment. This is the explanation why the soul cannot be\r\nconscious of all objects simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe Nyaya system is only a development and complement of that of\r\nKanada, its metaphysics and psychology being the same. Its specific\r\ncharacter consists in its being a very detailed and acute exposition of\r\nformal logic. As such it has remained the foundation of philosophical\r\nstudies in India down to the present day. Besides dealing fully with\r\nthe means of knowledge, which it states to be perception, inference,\r\nanalogy, and trustworthy evidence, it treats exhaustively of syllogisms\r\nand fallacies. It is interesting to note that the Indian mind here\r\nindependently arrived at an exposition of the syllogism as the form of\r\ndeductive reasoning. The text-book of this system is the Nyaya-sutra of\r\nGotama. The importance here attached to logic appears from the very\r\nfirst aphorism, which enumerates sixteen logical notions with the\r\nremark that salvation depends on a correct knowledge of their nature.\r\n\r\nNeither the Vaiçeshika nor the Nyaya-sutras originally accepted the\r\nexistence of God; and though both schools later became theistic,\r\nthey never went so far as to assume a creator of matter. Their\r\ntheology is first found developed in Udayanacharya's Kusumanjali,\r\nwhich was written about 1200 A.D., and in works which deal with the\r\ntwo systems conjointly. Here God is regarded as a \"special\" soul, which\r\ndiffers from all other individual eternal souls by exemption from all\r\nqualities connected with transmigration, and by the possession of the\r\npower and knowledge qualifying him to be a regulator of the universe.\r\n\r\nOf the eclectic movement combining Sankhya, Yoga, and Vedanta\r\ndoctrines, the oldest literary representative is the Çvetaçvatara\r\nUpanishad. More famous is the Bhagavadgita in which the Supreme\r\nBeing incarnate as Krishna expounds to Arjuna his doctrines in this\r\nsense. The burden of his teaching is that the zealous performance\r\nof his duty is a man's most important task, to whatever caste he may\r\nbelong. The beauty and the power of the language in which this doctrine\r\nis inculcated, is unsurpassed in any other work of Indian literature.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the orthodox systems and the two non-Brahmanical\r\nreligions, flourished the lokayata (\"directed to the world of sense\"),\r\nor materialistic school, usually called that of the Charvakas from the\r\nname of the founder of the doctrine. It was regarded as peculiarly\r\nheretical, for it not only rejected the authority of the Vedas and\r\nBrahmanic ceremonial, but denied the doctrines of transmigration and\r\nsalvation accepted by all other systems. Materialistic teachings\r\nmay be traced even before the time of Buddha, and they have had\r\nmany secret followers in India down to the present day. The system,\r\nhowever, seems never to have had more than one text-book, the lost\r\nSutras of Brihaspati, its mythical founder. Our knowledge of it is\r\nderived partly from the polemics of other schools, but especially from\r\nthe Sarvadarçana-samgraha, or \"Compendium of all the Philosophical\r\nSystems,\" composed in the fourteenth century by the well-known\r\nVedantist Madhavacharya, brother of Sayana. The strong scepticism\r\nof the Charvakas showed itself in the rejection of all the means\r\nof knowledge accepted by other schools, excepting perception. To\r\nthem matter was the only reality. Soul they regarded as nothing\r\nbut the body with the attribute of intelligence. They held it to\r\nbe created when the body is formed by the combination of elements,\r\njust as the power of intoxication arises from the mixture of certain\r\ningredients. Hence with the annihilation of the body the soul also is\r\nannihilated. Not transmigration, they affirm, but the true nature of\r\nthings, is the cause from which phenomena proceed. The existence of\r\nall that transcends the senses they deny, sometimes with an admixture\r\nof irony. Thus the highest being, they say, is the king of the land,\r\nwhose existence is proved by the perception of the whole world;\r\nhell is earthly pain produced by earthly causes; and salvation is the\r\ndissolution of the body. Even in the attribution of their text-book to\r\nBrihaspati, the name of the preceptor of the gods, a touch of irony\r\nis to be detected. The religion of the Brahmans receives a severe\r\nhandling. The Vedas, say the Charvakas, are only the incoherent\r\nrhapsodies of knaves, and are tainted with the three blemishes of\r\nfalsehood, self-contradiction, and tautology; Vedic teachers are\r\nimpostors, whose doctrines are mutually destructive; and the ritual of\r\nthe Brahmans is useful only as a means of livelihood. \"If,\" they ask,\r\n\"an animal sacrificed reaches heaven, why does the sacrificer not\r\nrather offer his own father?\"\r\n\r\nOn the moral side the system is pure hedonism. For the only end of\r\nman is here stated to be sensual pleasure, which is to be enjoyed\r\nby neglecting as far as possible the pains connected with it,\r\njust as a man who desires fish takes the scales and bones into the\r\nbargain. \"While life remains, let a man live happily, let him feed on\r\nghee even though he run into debt; when once the body becomes ashes,\r\nhow can it ever return again?\"\r\n\r\nThe author of the Sarvadarçana-samgraha, placing himself with\r\nremarkable mental detachment in the position of an adherent in each\r\ncase, describes altogether sixteen systems. The six which have not been\r\nsketched above, besides being of little importance, are not purely\r\nphilosophic. Five of these are sectarian, one Vishnuite and four\r\nÇivite, all of them being strongly tinctured with Sankhya and Vedanta\r\ndoctrines. The sixth, the system of Panini, is classed by Madhava\r\namong the philosophies, simply because the Indian grammarians accepted\r\nthe Mimamsa dogma of the eternity of sound, and philosophically\r\ndeveloped the Yoga theory of the sphuta, or the imperceptible and\r\neternal element inherent in every word as the vehicle of its sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSANSKRIT LITERATURE AND THE WEST\r\n\r\n\r\nWant of space makes it impossible for me to give even the briefest\r\naccount of the numerous and, in many cases, important legal and\r\nscientific works written in Sanskrit. But I cannot conclude this\r\nsurvey of Sanskrit literature as an embodiment of Indian culture\r\nwithout sketching rapidly the influence which it has received from and\r\nexercised upon the nations of the West. An adequate treatment of this\r\nhighly interesting theme could only be presented in a special volume.\r\n\r\nThe oldest trace of contact between the Indians and the peoples of\r\nthe West is to be found in the history of Indian writing, which,\r\nas we have already seen (p. 16) was derived from a Semitic source,\r\nprobably as early as 800 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe Aryans having conquered Hindustan in prehistoric times,\r\nbegan themselves to fall under foreign domination from an early\r\nperiod. The extreme north-west became subject to Persian sway from\r\nabout 500 to 331 B.C. under the Achæmenid dynasty. Cyrus the First\r\nmade tributary the Indian tribes of the Gandharas and Açvakas. The\r\nold Persian inscriptions of Behistun and Persepolis show that his\r\nsuccessor, Darius Hystaspis, ruled over not only the Gandharians,\r\nbut also the people of the Indus. Herodotus also states that this\r\nmonarch had subjected the \"Northern Indians.\" At the command of the\r\nsame Darius, a Greek named Skylax is said to have travelled in India,\r\nand to have navigated the Indus in 509 B.C. From his account various\r\nGreek writers, among them Herodotus, derived their information about\r\nIndia. In the army which Xerxes led against Greece in 480 B.C. there\r\nwere divisions of Gandharians and Indians, whose dress and equipment\r\nare described by Herodotus. That historian also makes the statement\r\nthat the satrapy of India furnished the heaviest tribute in the Persian\r\nempire, adding that the gold with which it was paid was brought from\r\na desert in the east, where it was dug up by ants larger than foxes.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the fourth century B.C., the Greek physician\r\nKtesias, who resided at the court of Artaxerxes II., learnt much from\r\nthe Persians about India, and was personally acquainted with wise\r\nIndians. Little useful information can, however, be derived from\r\nthe account of India which he wrote after his return in 398 B.C.,\r\nas it has been very imperfectly preserved, and his reputation for\r\nveracity did not stand high among his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the Persian empire by Alexander the Great led to a\r\nnew invasion of India, which fixes the first absolutely certain date\r\nin Indian history. In 327 B.C. Alexander passed over the Hindu Kush\r\nwith an army of 120,000 infantry and 30,000 cavalry. After taking\r\nthe town of Pushkalavati (the Greek Peukelaotis) at the confluence\r\nof the Kabul and Indus, and subduing the Açvakas (variously called\r\nAssakanoi, Aspasioi, Hippasioi, by Greek writers) on the north and\r\nthe Gandharas on the south of the Kabul River, he crossed the Indus\r\nearly in 326. At Takshaçila (Greek Taxiles), between the Indus and\r\nthe Jhelum (Hydaspes), the Greeks for the first time saw Brahman\r\nYogis, or \"the wise men of the Indians,\" as they called them, and\r\nwere astonished at their asceticism and strange doctrines.\r\n\r\nBetween the Jhelum and the Chenab (Akesines) lay the kingdom of\r\nthe Pauravas or Pauras, whose prince, called Porus by the Greeks\r\nfrom the name of his people, led out an army of 50,000 infantry,\r\n4000 cavalry, 200 elephants, and 400 chariots to check the advance\r\nof the invader. Then on the banks of the Jhelum was fought the\r\ngreat historic battle, in which Alexander, after a severe struggle,\r\nfinally won the day by superior numbers and force of genius. He\r\ncontinued his victorious march eastwards till he reached the Sutlej\r\n(Greek Zadadres). But here his further progress towards the Ganges\r\nwas arrested by the opposition of his Macedonians, intimidated by\r\nthe accounts they heard of the great power of the king of the Prasioi\r\n(Sanskrit Prachyas, or \"Easterns\"). Hence, after appointing satraps\r\nof the Panjab and of Sindh, he sailed down to the mouths of the Indus\r\nand returned to Persia by Gedrosia. Of the writings of those who\r\naccompanied Alexander, nothing has been preserved except statements\r\nfrom them in later authors.\r\n\r\nAfter Alexander's death the assassination of the old king Porus\r\nby Eudemus, the satrap of the Panjab, led to a rebellion in which\r\nthe Indians cast off the Greek yoke under the leadership of a young\r\nadventurer named Chandragupta (the Sandrakottos or Sandrokyptos of\r\nthe Greeks). Having gained possession of the Indus territory in 317,\r\nand dethroned the king of Pataliputra in 315 B.C., he became master\r\nof the whole Ganges Valley as well. The Maurya dynasty, which he\r\nthus founded, lasted for 137 years (315-178 B.C.). His empire was the\r\nlargest hitherto known in India, as it embraced the whole territory\r\nbetween the Himalaya and the Vindhya from the mouths of the Ganges\r\nto the Indus, including Gujarat.\r\n\r\nSeleucus, who had founded a kingdom in Media and Persia, feeling\r\nhimself unable to vanquish Chandragupta, sent a Greek named Megasthenes\r\nto reside at his court at Pataliputra. This ambassador thus lived\r\nfor several years in the heart of India between 311 and 302 B.C.,\r\nand wrote a work entitled Ta Indika, which is particularly valuable\r\nas the earliest direct record of his visit by a foreigner who knew\r\nthe country himself. Megasthenes furnishes particulars about the\r\nstrength of Chandragupta's army and the administration of the state. He\r\nmentions forest ascetics (Hylobioi), and distinguishes Brachmanes and\r\nSarmanai as two classes of philosophers, meaning, doubtless, Brahmans\r\nand Buddhists (çramanas). He tells us that the Indians worshipped\r\nthe rain-bringing Zeus (Indra) as well as the Ganges, which must,\r\ntherefore, have already been a sacred river. By his description of\r\nthe god Dionysus, whom they worshipped in the mountains, Çiva must\r\nbe intended, and by Herakles, adored in the plains, especially among\r\nthe Çurasenas on the Yamuna and in the city of Methora, no other can\r\nbe meant than Vishnu and his incarnation Krishna, the chief city of\r\nwhose tribe of Yadavas was Mathura (Muttra). These statements seem to\r\njustify the conclusion that Çiva and Vishnu were already prominent as\r\nhighest gods, the former in the mountains, the latter in the Ganges\r\nValley. Krishna would also seem to have been regarded as an Avatar of\r\nVishnu, though it is to be noted that Krishna is not yet mentioned\r\nin the old Buddhist Sutras. We also learn from Megasthenes that the\r\ndoctrine of the four ages of the world (yugas) was fully developed\r\nin India by his time.\r\n\r\nChandragupta's grandson, the famous Açoka, not only maintained his\r\nnational Indian empire, but extended it in every direction. Having\r\nadopted Buddhism as the state religion, he did much to spread its\r\ndoctrines, especially to Ceylon, which since then has remained the\r\nmost faithful guardian of Buddhist tradition.\r\n\r\nAfter Açoka's death the Græco-Bactrian princes began about 200\r\nB.C. to conquer Western India, and ruled there for about eighty\r\nyears. Euthydemos extended his dominions to the Jhelum. His son\r\nDemetrios (early in the second century B.C.) appears to have held sway\r\nover the Lower Indus, Malava, Gujarat, and probably also Kashmir. He\r\nis called \"King of the Indians,\" and was the first to introduce\r\na bilingual coinage by adding an Indian inscription in Kharoshthi\r\ncharacters on the reverse to the Greek on the obverse. Eukratides\r\n(190-160 B.C.), who rebelled against Demetrios, subjected the Panjab\r\nas far east as the Beäs. After the reign of Heliokles (160-120 B.C.),\r\nthe Greek princes in India ceased to be connected with Bactria. The\r\nmost prominent among these Græco-Indians was Menander (c. 150 B.C.),\r\nwho, under the name of Milinda, is well known in Buddhist writings. The\r\nlast vestige of Greek domination in India disappeared about 20 B.C.,\r\nhaving lasted nearly two centuries. It is a remarkable fact that no\r\nGreek monumental inscriptions have ever been found in India.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the Græco-Indian period also commenced the\r\nincursions of the Scythic tribes, who are called Indo-Scythians by\r\nthe Greeks, and by the Indians Çakas, the Persian designation of\r\nScythians in general. Of these so-called Scythians the Jats of the\r\nPanjab are supposed to be the descendants. The rule of these Çaka\r\nkings, the earliest of whom is Maues or Moa (c. 120 B.C.), endured\r\ndown to 178 A.D., or about three centuries. Their memory is preserved\r\nin India by the Çaka era, which is still in use, and dates from 78\r\nA.D., the inaugural year of Kanishka, the only famous king of this\r\nrace. His dominions, which included Kanyakubja (Kanauj) on the Ganges,\r\nextended beyond the confines of India to parts of Central Asia. A\r\nzealous adherent of Buddhism, he made Gandhara and Kashmir the chief\r\nseat of that religion, and held the fourth Buddhist council in the\r\nlatter country.\r\n\r\nAbout 20 B.C. the Çakas were followed into India by the Kushanas,\r\nwho were one of the five tribes of the Yueh-chi from Central Asia,\r\nand who subsequently conquered the whole of Northern India.\r\n\r\nAfter having been again united into a single empire almost as great as\r\nthat of Chandragupta under the national dynasty of the Guptas, from 319\r\nto 480 A.D., Northern India, partly owing to the attacks of the Hunas,\r\nwas split up into several kingdoms, some under the later Guptas, till\r\n606 A.D., when Harshavardhana of Kanauj gained paramount power over\r\nthe whole of Northern India. During his reign the poet Bana flourished,\r\nand the celebrated Chinese pilgrim Hiouen Thsang visited India.\r\n\r\nWith the Muhammadan conquest about 1000 A.D. the country again fell\r\nunder a foreign yoke. As after Alexander's invasion, we have the good\r\nfortune to possess in Alberuni's India (c. 1030 A.D.) the valuable\r\nwork of a cultivated foreigner, giving a detailed account of the\r\ncivilisation of India at this new era in its history.\r\n\r\nThis repeated contact of the Indians with foreign invaders from\r\nthe West naturally led to mutual influences in various branches\r\nof literature.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Epics, we find the statement of the Greek\r\nrhetorician Dio Chrysostomos (50-117 A.D.) that the Indians sang\r\nin their own language the poetry of Homer, the sorrows of Priam,\r\nthe laments of Andromache and Hecuba, the valour of Achilles and\r\nHector. The similarity of some of the leading characters of the\r\nMahabharata, to which the Greek writer evidently alludes, caused him\r\nto suppose that the Indian epic was a translation of the Iliad. There\r\nis, however, no connection of any kind between the two poems. Nor\r\ndoes Professor Weber's assumption of Greek influence on the Ramayana\r\nappear to have any sufficient basis (p. 307).\r\n\r\nThe view has been held that the worship of Krishna, who, as we have\r\nseen, plays an important part in the Mahabharata, arose under the\r\ninfluence of Christianity, with which it certainly has some rather\r\nstriking points of resemblance. This theory is, however, rendered\r\nimprobable, at least as far as the origin of the cult of Krishna is\r\nconcerned, by the conclusions at which we have arrived regarding the\r\nage of the Mahabharata (pp. 286-287), as well as by the statements of\r\nMegasthenes, which indicate that Krishna was deified and worshipped\r\nsome centuries before the beginning of our era. We know, moreover,\r\nfrom the Mahabhashya that the story of Krishna was the subject of\r\ndramatic representations in the second or, at latest, the first\r\ncentury before the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting question whether the Indian drama has any genetic\r\nconnection with that of Greece. It must be admitted that opportunities\r\nfor such a connection may have existed during the first three\r\ncenturies preceding our era. On his expedition to India, Alexander\r\nwas accompanied by numerous artists, among whom there may have been\r\nactors. Seleucus gave his daughter in marriage to Chandragupta, and\r\nboth that ruler and Ptolemy II. maintained relations with the court of\r\nPataliputra by means of ambassadors. Greek dynasties ruled in Western\r\nIndia for nearly two centuries. Alexandria was connected by a lively\r\ncommerce with the town called by the Greeks Barygaza (now Broach), at\r\nthe mouth of the Narmada (Nerbudda) in Gujarat; with the latter town\r\nwas united by a trade route the city of Ujjayini (Greek Ozene), which\r\nin consequence reached a high pitch of prosperity. Philostratus (second\r\ncentury A.D.), not it is true a very trustworthy authority, states\r\nin his Life of Apollonius of Tyana, who visited India about 50 A.D.,\r\nthat Greek literature was held in high esteem by the Brahmans. Indian\r\ninscriptions mention Yavana or Greek girls sent to India as tribute,\r\nand Sanskrit authors, especially Kalidasa, describe Indian princes\r\nas waited on by them. Professor Weber has even conjectured that the\r\nIndian god of love, Kama, bears a dolphin (makara) in his banner,\r\nlike the Greek Eros, through the influence of Greek courtesans.\r\n\r\nThe existence of such conditions has induced Professor Weber to\r\nbelieve that the representations of Greek plays, which must have\r\ntaken place at the courts of Greek princes in Bactria, in the Panjab,\r\nand in Gujarat, suggested the drama to the Indians as a subject for\r\nimitation. This theory is supported by the fact that the curtain of\r\nthe Indian stage is called yavanika or the \"Greek partition.\" Weber\r\nat the same time admits that there is no internal connection between\r\nthe Indian and the Greek drama.\r\n\r\nProfessor Windisch, however, went further, and maintained such\r\ninternal connection. It was, indeed, impossible for him to point out\r\nany affinity to the Greek tragedy, but he thought he could trace in\r\nthe Mricchakatika the influence of the new Attic comedy, which reached\r\nits zenith with Menander about 300 B.C. The points in which that play\r\nresembles this later Greek comedy are fewer and slighter in other\r\nSanskrit dramas, and can easily be explained as independently developed\r\nin India. The improbability of the theory is emphasised by the still\r\ngreater affinity of the Indian drama to that of Shakespeare. It is\r\ndoubtful whether Greek plays were ever actually performed in India; at\r\nany rate, no references to such performances have been preserved. The\r\nearliest Sanskrit plays extant are, moreover, separated from the Greek\r\nperiod by at least four hundred years. The Indian drama has had a\r\nthoroughly national development, and even its origin, though obscure,\r\neasily admits of an indigenous explanation. The name of the curtain,\r\nyavanika, may, indeed, be a reminiscence of Greek plays actually seen\r\nin India; but it is uncertain whether the Greek theatre had a curtain\r\nat all; in any case, it did not form the background of the stage.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact worth noting, that the beginning of one of the most famous\r\nof modern European dramas has been modelled on that of a celebrated\r\nSanskrit play. The prelude of Çakuntala suggested to Goethe the plan\r\nof the prologue on the stage in Faust, where the stage-manager, the\r\nmerryandrew, and the poet converse regarding the play about to be\r\nperformed (cf. p. 351). Forster's German translation of Kalidasa's\r\nmasterpiece appeared in 1791, and the profound impression it produced\r\non Goethe is proved by the well-known epigram he composed on Çakuntala\r\nin the same year. The impression was a lasting one; for the theatre\r\nprologue of Faust was not written till 1797, and as late as 1830 the\r\npoet thought of adapting the Indian play for the Weimar stage.\r\n\r\nIf in epic and dramatic poetry hardly any definite influences can be\r\ntraced between India and the West, how different is the case in the\r\ndomain of fables and fairy tales! The story of the migration of these\r\nfrom India certainly forms the most romantic chapter in the literary\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\nWe know that in the sixth century A.D. there existed in India a\r\nBuddhist collection of fables, in which animals play the part\r\nof human beings (cf. p. 369). By the command of the Sassanian\r\nking, Khosru Anushirvan (531-579), this work was translated by a\r\nPersian physician named Barzoi into Pehlevi. Both this version and\r\nthe unmodified original have been lost, but two early and notable\r\ntranslations from the Pehlevi have been preserved. The Syriac one was\r\nmade about 570 A.D., and called Kalilag and Damnag. A manuscript of\r\nit was found by chance in 1870, and, becoming known to scholars by\r\na wonderful chapter of lucky accidents, was published in 1876. The\r\nArabic translation from the Pehlevi, entitled Kalilah and Dimnah,\r\nor \"Fables of Pilpay,\" was made in the eighth century by a Persian\r\nconvert to Islam, who died about 760 A.D. In this translation a\r\nwicked king is represented to be reclaimed to virtue by a Brahman\r\nphilosopher named Bidbah, a word which has been satisfactorily traced\r\nthrough Pehlevi to the Sanskrit vidyapati, \"master of sciences,\"\r\n\"chief scholar.\" From this bidbah is derived the modern Bidpai or\r\nPilpay, which is thus not a proper name at all.\r\n\r\nThis Arabic version is of great importance, as the source of other\r\nversions which exercised very great influence in shaping the literature\r\nof the Middle Ages in Europe. These versions of it were the later\r\nSyriac (c. 1000 A.D.), the Greek (1180), the Persian (c. 1130), recast\r\nlater (c. 1494) under the title of Anvar-i-Suhaili, or \"Lights of\r\nCanopus,\" the old Spanish (1251), and the Hebrew one made about 1250.\r\n\r\nThe fourth stratum of translation is represented by John of Capua's\r\nrendering of the Hebrew version into Latin (c. 1270), entitled\r\nDirectorium Humanæ Vitæ which was printed about 1480.\r\n\r\nFrom John of Capua's work was made, at the instance of Duke Eberhardt\r\nof Würtemberg, the famous German version, Das Buch der Byspel der\r\nalten Wysen, or \"Book of Apologues of the Ancient Sages,\" first\r\nprinted about 1481. The fact that four dated editions appeared\r\nat Ulm between 1483 and 1485, and thirteen more down to 1592, is\r\na sufficiently eloquent proof of the importance of this work as a\r\nmeans of instruction and amusement during the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies. The Directorium was also the source of the Italian version,\r\nprinted at Venice in 1552, from which came the English translation of\r\nSir Thomas North (1570). The latter was thus separated from the Indian\r\noriginal by five intervening translations and a thousand years of time.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the changes which tales undergo in the\r\ncourse of such wanderings. In the second edition of his Fables\r\n(1678), La Fontaine acknowledges his indebtedness for a large part\r\nof his work to the Indian sage Pilpay. A well-known story in the\r\nFrench writer is that of the milkmaid, who, while carrying a pail\r\nof milk on her head to market, and building all kinds of castles in\r\nthe air with the future proceeds of the sale of the milk, suddenly\r\ngives a jump of joy at the prospect of her approaching fortune, and\r\nthereby shatters the pail to pieces on the ground. This is only a\r\ntransformation of a story still preserved in the Panchatantra. Here\r\nit is a Brahman who, having filled an alms-bowl with the remnants of\r\nsome rice-pap he has begged, hangs it up on a nail in the wall above\r\nhis bed. He dreams of the money he will procure by selling the rice\r\nwhen a famine breaks out. Then he will gradually acquire cattle, buy\r\na fine house, and marry a beautiful girl with a rich dowry. One day\r\nwhen he calls to his wife to take away his son who is playing about,\r\nand she does not hear, he will rise up to give her a kick. As this\r\nthought passes through his mind, his foot shatters the alms-bowl,\r\nthe contents of which are spilt all over him.\r\n\r\nAnother Panchatantra story recurring in La Fontaine is that of the\r\ntoo avaricious jackal. Finding the dead bodies of a boar and a hunter,\r\nbesides the bow of the latter, he resolves on devouring the bowstring\r\nfirst. As soon as he begins to gnaw, the bow starts asunder, pierces\r\nhis head, and kills him. In La Fontaine the jackal has become a wolf,\r\nand the latter is killed by the arrow shot off as he touches the bow.\r\n\r\nNothing, perhaps, in the history of the migration of Indian tales is\r\nmore remarkable than the story of Barlaam and Josaphat. At the court of\r\nKhalif Almansur (753-774), under whom Kalilah and Dimnah was translated\r\ninto Arabic, there lived a Christian known as John of Damascus,\r\nwho wrote in Greek the story of Barlaam and Josaphat as a manual of\r\nChristian theology. This became one of the most popular books of the\r\nMiddle Ages, being translated into many Oriental as well as European\r\nlanguages. It is enlivened by a number of fables and parables, most of\r\nwhich have been traced to Indian sources. The very hero of the story,\r\nPrince Josaphat, has an Indian origin, being, in fact, no other than\r\nBuddha. The name has been shown to be a corruption of Bodhisattva,\r\na well-known designation of the Indian reformer. Josaphat rose to the\r\nrank of a saint both in the Greek and the Roman Church, his day in the\r\nformer being August 26, in the latter November 27. That the founder of\r\nan atheistic Oriental religion should have developed into a Christian\r\nsaint is one of the most astounding facts in religious history.\r\n\r\nThough Europe was thus undoubtedly indebted to India for its mediæval\r\nliterature of fairy tales and fables, the Indian claim to priority\r\nof origin in ancient times is somewhat dubious. A certain number of\r\napologues found in the collections of Æsop and Babrius are distinctly\r\nrelated to Indian fables. The Indian claim is supported by the argument\r\nthat the relation of the jackal to the lion is a natural one in the\r\nIndian fable, while the connection of the fox and the lion in Greece\r\nhas no basis in fact. On the other side it has been urged that animals\r\nand birds which are peculiar to India play but a minor part in Indian\r\nfables, while there exists a Greek representation of the Æsopian fable\r\nof the fox and the raven, dating from the sixth century B.C. Weber and\r\nBenfey both conclude that the Indians borrowed a few fables from the\r\nGreeks, admitting at the same time that the Indians had independent\r\nfables of their own before. Rudimentary fables are found even in\r\nthe Chhandogya Upanishad, and the transmigration theory would have\r\nfavoured the development of this form of tale; indeed Buddha himself\r\nin the old Jataka stories appears in the form of various animals.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with the fable literature, the most intellectual game\r\nthe world has known began its westward migration from India. Chess\r\nin Sanskrit is called chatur-anga, or the \"four-limbed army,\"\r\nbecause it represents a kriegspiel, in which two armies, consisting\r\nof infantry, cavalry, chariots, and elephants, each led by a king\r\nand his councillor, are opposed. The earliest direct mention of\r\nthe game in Sanskrit literature is found in the works of Bana, and\r\nthe Kavyalamkara of Rudrata, a Kashmirian poet of the ninth century,\r\ncontains a metrical puzzle illustrating the moves of the chariot, the\r\nelephant, and the horse. Introduced into Persia in the sixth century,\r\nchess was brought by the Arabs to Europe, where it was generally known\r\nby 1100 A.D. It has left its mark on mediæval poetry, on the idioms\r\nof European languages (e.g. \"check,\" from the Persian shah, \"king\"),\r\non the science of arithmetic in the calculation of progressions with\r\nthe chessboard, and even in heraldry, where the \"rook\" often figures\r\nin coats of arms. Beside the fable literature of India, this Indian\r\ngame served to while away the tedious life of myriads during the\r\nMiddle Ages in Europe.\r\n\r\nTurning to Philosophical Literature, we find that the early Greek and\r\nIndian philosophers have many points in common. Some of the leading\r\ndoctrines of the Eleatics, that God and the universe are one, that\r\neverything existing in multiplicity has no reality, that thinking\r\nand being are identical, are all to be found in the philosophy of\r\nthe Upanishads and the Vedanta system, which is its outcome. Again,\r\nthe doctrine of Empedocles, that nothing can arise which has not\r\nexisted before, and that nothing existing can be annihilated, has\r\nits exact parallel in the characteristic doctrine of the Sankhya\r\nsystem about the eternity and indestructibility of matter. According\r\nto Greek tradition, Thales, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, and\r\nothers undertook journeys to Oriental countries in order to study\r\nphilosophy. Hence there is at least the historical possibility of\r\nthe Greeks having been influenced by Indian thought through Persia.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the truth in the cases just mentioned, the dependence\r\nof Pythagoras on Indian philosophy and science certainly seems to\r\nhave a high degree of probability. Almost all the doctrines ascribed\r\nto him, religious, philosophical, mathematical, were known in India\r\nin the sixth century B.C. The coincidences are so numerous that their\r\ncumulative force becomes considerable. The transmigration theory, the\r\nassumption of five elements, the Pythagorean theorem in geometry, the\r\nprohibition as to eating beans, the religio-philosophical character\r\nof the Pythagorean fraternity, and the mystical speculations of\r\nthe Pythagorean school, all have their close parallels in ancient\r\nIndia. The doctrine of metempsychosis in the case of Pythagoras appears\r\nwithout any connection or explanatory background, and was regarded\r\nby the Greeks as of foreign origin. He could not have derived it\r\nfrom Egypt, as it was not known to the ancient Egyptians. In spite,\r\nhowever, of the later tradition, it seems impossible that Pythagoras\r\nshould have made his way to India at so early a date, but he could\r\nquite well have met Indians in Persia.\r\n\r\nComing to later centuries, we find indications that the Neo-Platonist\r\nphilosophy may have been influenced by the Sankhya system, which\r\nflourished in the first centuries of our era, and could easily have\r\nbecome known at Alexandria owing to the lively intercourse between\r\nthat city and India at the time. From this source Plotinus (204-269\r\nA.D.), chief of the Neo-Platonists, may have derived his doctrine\r\nthat soul is free from suffering, which belongs only to matter,\r\nhis identification of soul with light, and his illustrative use\r\nof the mirror, in which the reflections of objects appear, for the\r\npurpose of explaining the phenomena of consciousness. The influence\r\nof the Yoga system on Plotinus is suggested by his requirement that\r\nman should renounce the world of sense and strive after truth by\r\ncontemplation. Connection with Sankhya ideas is still more likely in\r\nthe case of Plotinus's most eminent pupil, Porphyry (232-304 A.D.),\r\nwho lays particular stress on the difference between soul and matter,\r\non the omnipresence of soul when freed from the bonds of matter, and\r\non the doctrine that the world has no beginning. It is also noteworthy\r\nthat he rejects sacrifice and prohibits the killing of animals.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Indian philosophy on Christian Gnosticism in the\r\nsecond and third centuries seems at any rate undoubted. The Gnostic\r\ndoctrine of the opposition between soul and matter, of the personal\r\nexistence of intellect, will, and so forth, the identification of soul\r\nand light, are derived from the Sankhya system. The division, peculiar\r\nto several Gnostics, of men into the three classes of pneumatikoi,\r\npsychikoi, and hylikoi, is also based on the Sankhya doctrine of the\r\nthree gunas. Again, Bardesanes, a Gnostic of the Syrian school, who\r\nobtained information about India from Indian philosophers, assumed\r\nthe existence of a subtle ethereal body which is identical with the\r\nlinga-çarira of the Sankhya system. Finally, the many heavens of\r\nthe Gnostics are evidently derived from the fantastic cosmogony of\r\nlater Buddhism.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the present century, the influence of Indian thought\r\non the pessimistic philosophy of Schopenhauer and Von Hartmann is\r\nwell known. How great an impression the Upanishads produced on the\r\nformer, even in a second-hand Latin translation, may be inferred from\r\nhis writing that they were his consolation in life and would be so\r\nin death.\r\n\r\nIn Science, too, the debt of Europe to India has been\r\nconsiderable. There is, in the first place, the great fact that the\r\nIndians invented the numerical figures used all over the world. The\r\ninfluence which the decimal system of reckoning dependent on those\r\nfigures has had not only on mathematics, but on the progress of\r\ncivilisation in general, can hardly be over-estimated. During\r\nthe eighth and ninth centuries the Indians became the teachers in\r\narithmetic and algebra of the Arabs, and through them of the nations\r\nof the West. Thus, though we call the latter science by an Arabic name,\r\nit is a gift we owe to India.\r\n\r\nIn Geometry the points of contact between the Çulva Sutras and the\r\nwork of the Greeks are so considerable, that, according to Cantor,\r\nthe historian of mathematics, borrowing must have taken place on one\r\nside or the other. In the opinion of that authority, the Çulva Sutras\r\nwere influenced by the Alexandrian geometry of Hero (215 B.C.), which,\r\nhe thinks, came to India after 100 B.C. The Çulva Sutras are, however,\r\nprobably far earlier than that date, for they form an integral portion\r\nof the Çrauta Sutras, and their geometry is a part of the Brahmanical\r\ntheology, having taken its rise in India from practical motives as much\r\nas the science of grammar. The prose parts of the Yajurvedas and the\r\nBrahmanas constantly speak of the arrangement of the sacrificial ground\r\nand the construction of altars according to very strict rules, the\r\nslightest deviation from which might cause the greatest disaster. It\r\nis not likely that the exclusive Brahmans should have been willing to\r\nborrow anything closely connected with their religion from foreigners.\r\n\r\nOf Astronomy the ancient Indians had but slight independent\r\nknowledge. It is probable that they derived their early acquaintance\r\nwith the twenty-eight divisions of the moon's orbit from the Chaldeans\r\nthrough their commercial relations with the Phoenicians. Indian\r\nastronomy did not really begin to flourish till it was affected by that\r\nof Greece; it is indeed the one science in which undoubtedly strong\r\nGreek influence can be proved. The debt which the native astronomers\r\nalways acknowledge they owe to the Yavanas is sufficiently obvious\r\nfrom the numerous Greek terms in Indian astronomical writings. Thus,\r\nin Varaha Mihira's Hora-çastra the signs of the zodiac are enumerated\r\neither by Sanskrit names translated from the Greek or by the original\r\nGreek names, as Ara for Ares, Heli for Helios, Jyau for Zeus. Many\r\ntechnical terms were directly borrowed from Greek works, as kendra\r\nfor kentron, jamitra for diametron. Some of the very names of the\r\noldest astronomical treatises of the Indians indicate their Western\r\norigin. Thus the Romaka-siddhanta means the \"Roman manual.\" The title\r\nof Varaha Mihira's Hora-çastra contains the Greek word hora.\r\n\r\nIn a few respects, however, the Indians independently advanced\r\nastronomical science further than the Greeks themselves, and at a later\r\nperiod they in their turn influenced the West even in astronomy. For\r\nin the eighth and ninth centuries they became the teachers of the\r\nArabs in this science also. The siddhantas (Arabic Sind Hind), the\r\nwritings of Aryabhata (called Arjehir), and the Ahargana (Arkand),\r\nattributed to Brahmagupta, were translated or adapted by the Arabs,\r\nand Khalifs of Bagdad repeatedly summoned Indian astronomers to their\r\ncourt to supervise this work. Through the Arabs, Indian astronomy\r\nthen migrated to Europe, which in this case only received back in a\r\nroundabout way what it had given long before. Thus the Sanskrit word\r\nuchcha, \"apex of a planet's orbit,\" was borrowed in the form of aux\r\n(gen. aug-is) in Latin translations of Arabic astronomers.\r\n\r\nAfter Bhaskara (twelfth century), Hindu astronomy, ceasing to make\r\nfurther progress, became once more merged in the astrology from which\r\nit had sprung. It was now the turn of the Arabs, and, by a strange\r\ninversion of things, an Arabic writer of the ninth century who had\r\nwritten on Indian astronomy and arithmetic, in this period became an\r\nobject of study to the Hindus. The old Greek terms remained, but new\r\nArabic ones were added as the necessity for them arose.\r\n\r\nThe question as to whether Indian Medical Science in its earlier\r\nperiod was affected by that of the Greeks cannot yet be answered with\r\ncertainty, the two systems not having hitherto been compared with\r\nsufficient care. Recently, however, some close parallels have been\r\ndiscovered between the works of Hippocrates and Charaka (according\r\nto a Chinese authority, the official physician of King Kanishka),\r\nwhich render Greek influence before the beginning of our era likely.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the effect of Hindu medical science upon the Arabs\r\nafter about 700 A.D. was considerable, for the Khalifs of Bagdad caused\r\nseveral books on the subject to be translated. The works of Charaka\r\nand Suçruta (probably not later than the fourth century A.D.) were\r\nrendered into Arabic at the close of the eighth century, and are\r\nquoted as authorities by the celebrated Arabic physician Al-Razi,\r\nwho died in 932 A.D. Arabic medicine in its turn became the chief\r\nauthority, down to the seventeenth century, of European physicians. By\r\nthe latter Indian medical authors must have been thought highly of,\r\nfor Charaka is repeatedly mentioned in the Latin translations of the\r\nArab writers Avicenna (Ibn Sina), Rhazes (Al-Razi), and Serapion (Ibn\r\nSarafyun). In modern days European surgery has borrowed the operation\r\nof rhinoplasty, or the formation of artificial noses, from India,\r\nwhere Englishmen became acquainted with the art in the last century.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the discovery of the Sanskrit language\r\nand literature led, in the present century, to the foundation\r\nof the two new sciences of Comparative Mythology and Comparative\r\nPhilology. Through the latter it has even affected the practical\r\nschool-teaching of the classical languages in Europe. The interest in\r\nBuddhism has already produced an immense literature in Europe. Some\r\nof the finest lyrics of Heine, and works like Sir Edwin Arnold's\r\nLight of Asia, to mention only a few instances, have drawn their\r\ninspiration from Sanskrit poetry. The intellectual debt of Europe to\r\nSanskrit literature has thus been undeniably great; it may perhaps\r\nbecome greater still in the years that are to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX ON TECHNICAL LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW.\r\n\r\nOn Sanskrit legal literature in general, consult the very valuable\r\nwork of Jolly, Recht und Sitte, in Bühler's Encyclopædia, 1896\r\n(complete bibliography). There are several secondary Dharma Sutras of\r\nthe post-Vedic period. The most important of these is the Vaishnava\r\nDharma Çastra or Vishnu Smriti (closely connected with the Kathaka\r\nGrihya Sutra), not earlier than 200 A.D. in its final redaction (ed. by\r\nJolly, Calcutta, 1881, trans. by him in the Sacred Books of the East,\r\nOxford, 1880). The regular post-Vedic lawbooks are metrical (mostly\r\nin çlokas). They are much wider in scope than the Dharma Sutras, which\r\nare limited to matters connected with religion. The most important and\r\nearliest of the metrical Smritis is the Manava Dharma Çastra, or Code\r\nof Manu, not improbably based on a Manava Dharma Sutra. It is closely\r\nconnected with the Mahabharata, of which three books alone (iii.,\r\nxii., xvi.) contain as many as 260 of its 2684 çlokas. It probably\r\nassumed its present shape not much later than 200 A.D. It was ed. by\r\nJolly, London, 1887; trans. by Bühler, with valuable introd., in the\r\nSacred Books, Oxford, 1886; also trans. by Burnell (ed. by Hopkins),\r\nLondon, 1884; text ed., with seven comm., by Mandlik, Bombay, 1886;\r\ntext, with Kulluka's comm., Bombay, 1888, better than Nirn. Sag. Pr.,\r\ned. 1887. Next comes the Yajnavalkya Dharma Çastra, which is much\r\nmore concise (1009 çlokas). It was probably based on a Dharma Sutra\r\nof the White Yajurveda; its third section resembles the Paraskara\r\nGrihya Sutra, but it is unmistakably connected with the Manava Grihya\r\nSutra of the Black Yajurveda. Its approximate date seems to be about\r\n350 A.D. Its author probably belonged to Mithila, capital of Videha\r\n(Tirhut). Yajnavalkya, ed. and trans, by Stenzler, Berlin, 1849;\r\nwith comm. Mitakshara, 3rd ed., Bombay, 1892. The Narada Smriti is\r\nthe first to limit dharma to law in the strict sense. It contains\r\nmore than 12,000 çlokas, and appears to have been founded chiefly on\r\nManu. Bana mentions a Naradiya Dharma Çastra, and Narada was annotated\r\nby one of the earliest legal commentators in the eighth century. His\r\ndate is probably about 500 A.D. Narada, ed. by Jolly, Calcutta, 1885,\r\ntrans. by him in Sacred Books, vol. xxxiii. 1889. A late lawbook is the\r\nParaçara Smriti (anterior to 1300 A.D.), ed. in Bombay Sansk. Series,\r\n1893; trans. Bibl. Ind., 1887. The second stage of post-Vedic legal\r\nliterature is formed by the commentaries. The oldest one preserved\r\nis that of Medhatithi on Manu; he dates from about 900 A.D. The most\r\nfamous comm. on Manu is that of Kulluka-bhatta, composed at Benares\r\nin the fifteenth century, but it is nothing more than a plagiarism\r\nof Govindaraja, a commentator of the twelfth century. The most\r\ncelebrated comm. on Yajnavalkya is the Mitakshara of Vijnaneçvara,\r\ncomposed about 1100 A.D. It early attained to the position of a\r\nstandard work, not only in the Dekhan, but even in Benares and a\r\ngreat part of Northern India. In the present century it acquired the\r\ngreatest importance in the practice of the Anglo-Indian law-courts\r\nthrough Colebrooke's translation of the section which it contains on\r\nthe law of inheritance. From about 1000 A.D. onwards, an innumerable\r\nmultitude of legal compendia, called Dharma-nibandhas, was produced\r\nin India. The most imposing of them is the voluminous work in five\r\nparts entitled Chaturvarga-chintamani, composed by Hemadri about\r\n1300 A.D. It hardly treats of law at all, but is a perfect mine of\r\ninteresting quotations from the Smritis and the Puranas; it has been\r\nedited in the Bibl. Ind. The Dharmaratna of Jimutavahana (probably\r\nfifteenth century) may here be mentioned, because part of it is the\r\nfamous treatise on the law of inheritance entitled Dayabhaga, which is\r\nthe chief work of the Bengal School on the subject, and was translated\r\nby Colebrooke. It should be noted that the Indian Smritis are not on\r\nthe same footing as the lawbooks of other nations, but are works of\r\nprivate individuals; they were also written by Brahmans for Brahmans,\r\nwhose caste pretensions they consequently exaggerate. It is therefore\r\nimportant to check their statements by outside evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\nNo work of a directly historical character is met with in\r\nSanskrit literature till after the Muhammadan conquest. This is\r\nthe Rajatarangini, or \"River of Kings,\" a chronicle of the kings of\r\nKashmir, begun by its author, Kalhana, in 1148 A.D. It contains nearly\r\n8000 çlokas. The early part of the work is legendary in character. The\r\npoet does not become historical till he approaches his own times. This\r\nwork (ed. M. A. Stein, Bombay, 1892; trans, by Y. C. Datta, Calc.,\r\n1898) is of considerable value for the archæology and chronology\r\nof Kashmir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAMMAR.\r\n\r\nOn the native grammatical literature see especially Wackernagel,\r\nAltindische Grammatik, vol. i. p. lix. sqq. The oldest grammar\r\npreserved is that of Panini, who, however, mentions no fewer than\r\nsixty-four predecessors. He belonged to the extreme north-west of\r\nIndia, and probably flourished about 300 B.C. His work consists of\r\nnearly 4000 sutras divided into eight chapters; text with German\r\ntrans., ed. by Böhtlingk, Leipsic, 1887. Panini had before him a list\r\nof irregularly formed words, which survives, in a somewhat modified\r\nform, as the Unadi Sutra (ed. by Aufrecht, with Ujjvaladatta's comm.,\r\nBonn, 1859). There are also two appendixes to which Panini refers:\r\none is the Dhatupatha, \"List of Verbal Roots,\" containing some\r\n2000 roots, of which only about 800 have been found in Sanskrit\r\nliterature, and from which about fifty Vedic verbs are omitted;\r\nthe second is the Ganapatha, or \"List of Word-Groups,\" to which\r\ncertain rules apply. These ganas were metrically arranged in the\r\nGanaratna-mahodadhi, composed by Vardhamana in 1140 A.D. (ed. by\r\nEggeling, London, 1879). Among the earliest attempts to explain\r\nPanini was the formulation of rules of interpretation or paribhashas;\r\na collection of these was made in the last century by Nagojibhatta in\r\nhis Paribhashenduçekhara (ed. by Kielhorn, Bombay Sansk. Ser., 1868 and\r\n1871). Next we have the Varttikas or \"Notes\" of Katyayana (probably\r\nthird century B.C.) on 1245 of Panini's rules, and, somewhat later,\r\nnumerous grammatical Karikas or comments in metrical form: all this\r\ncritical work was collected by Patanjali in his Mahabhashya or \"Great\r\nCommentary,\" with supplementary comments of his own (ed. Kielhorn, 3\r\nvols., Bombay). He deals with 1713 rules of Panini. He probably lived\r\nin the later half of the second century B.C., and in any case not later\r\nthan the beginning of our era. The Mahabhashya was commented on in\r\nthe seventh century by Bhartrihari in his Vakyapadiya (ed. in Benares\r\nSansk. Ser.), which is concerned with the philosophy of grammar, and\r\nby Kaiyata (probably thirteenth century). About 650 A.D. was composed\r\nthe first complete comm. on Panini, the Kaçika Vritti or \"Benares\r\nCommentary,\" by Jayaditya and Vamana (2nd ed. Benares, 1898). In the\r\nfifteenth century Ramachandra, in his Prakriya-kaumudi, or \"Moonlight\r\nof Method,\" endeavoured to make Panini's grammar easier by a more\r\npractical arrangement of its matter. Bhattoji's Siddhanta-kaumudi\r\n(seventeenth century) has a similar aim (ed. Nirnaya Sagara Press,\r\nBombay, 1894); an abridgment of this work, the Laghu-kaumudi, by\r\nVaradaraja (ed. Ballantyne, with English trans., 4th ed., Benares,\r\n1891), is commonly used as an introduction to the native system of\r\ngrammar. Among non-Paninean grammarians may be mentioned Chandra\r\n(about 600 A.D.), the pseudo-Çakatayana (later than the Kaçika), and,\r\nthe most important, Hemachandra (12th cent.), author of a Prakrit\r\ngrammar (ed. and trans. by Pischel, two vols., Halle, 1877-80), and\r\nof the Unadigana Sutra (ed. Kirste, Vienna, 1895). The Katantra of\r\nÇarvavarman (ed. Eggeling, Bibl. Ind.) seems to have been the most\r\ninfluential of the later grammars. Vararuchi's Prakrita-prakaça is a\r\nPrakrit grammar (ed. by Cowell, 2nd ed., 1868). The Mugdhabodha (13th\r\ncent.) of Vopadeva is the Sanskrit grammar chiefly used in Bengal. The\r\nPhit Sutra (later than Patanjali) gives rules for the accentuation of\r\nnouns (ed. Kielhorn, 1866); Hemachandra's Linganuçasana is a treatise\r\non gender (ed. Franke, Göttingen, 1886). Among European grammars\r\nthat of Whitney was the first to attempt a historical treatment\r\nof the Vedic and Sanskrit language. The first grammar treating\r\nSanskrit from the comparative point of view is the excellent work\r\nof Wackernagel, of which, however, only the first part (phonology)\r\nhas yet appeared. The present writer's abridgment (London, 1886)\r\nof Max Müller's Sanskrit Grammar is a practical work for the use of\r\nbeginners of Classical Sanskrit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEXICOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nZachariæ in Die indischen Wörterbücher (in Bühler's Encyclopædia,\r\n1897) deals with the subject as a whole (complete bibliography). The\r\nSanskrit dictionaries or koças are collections of rare words\r\nor significations for the use of poets. They are all versified;\r\nalphabetical order is entirely absent in the synonymous and only\r\nincipient in the homonymous class. The Amarakoça (ed. with Maheçvara's\r\ncomm., Bombay), occupies the same dominant position in lexicography\r\nas Panini in grammar, not improbably composed about 500 A.D. A\r\nsupplement to it is the Trikanda-çesha by Purushottamadeva (perhaps\r\nas late as 1300 A.D.). Çaçvata's Anekartha-samuchchaya (ed. Zachariæ,\r\n1882) is possibly older than Amara. Halayudha's Abhidhanaratnamala\r\ndates from about 950 A.D. (ed. Aufrecht, London, 1861). About a\r\ncentury later is Yadavaprakaça's Vaijayanti (ed. Oppert, Madras,\r\n1893). The Viçvaprakaça of Maheçvara Kavi dates from 1111 A.D. The\r\nMankha-koça (ed. Zachariæ, Bombay, 1897) was composed in Kashmir about\r\n1150 A.D. Hemachandra (1088-1172 A.D.) composed four dictionaries:\r\nAbhidhana-chintamani, synonyms (ed. Böhtlingk and Rieu, St. Petersburg,\r\n1847); Anekartha-samgraha, homonyms (ed. Zachariæ, Vienna, 1893);\r\nDeçinamamala, a Prakrit dictionary (ed. Pischel, Bombay, 1880);\r\nand Nighantu-çesha, a botanical glossary, which forms a supplement\r\nto his synonymous koça.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETICS.\r\n\r\nCf. Sylvain Lévi, Théâtre Indien, pp. 1-21; Regnaud, La Rhétorique\r\nSanskrite, Paris, 1884; Jacob, Notes on Alamkara Literature, in Journal\r\nof the Roy. As. Soc., 1897, 1898. The oldest and most important work\r\non poetics is the Natya Çastra of Bharata, which probably goes back\r\nto the sixth century A.D. (ed. in Kavyamala, No. 42, Bombay, 1894;\r\ned. by Grosset, Lyons, 1897). Dandin's Kavyadarça (end of sixth\r\ncentury) contains about 650 çlokas (ed. with trans. by Böhtlingk,\r\nLeipsic, 1890). Vamana's Kavyalamkaravritti, probably eighth century\r\n(ed. Cappeller, Jena, 1875). Çringara-tilaka, or \"Ornament of Erotics,\"\r\nby Rudrabhata (ninth century), ed. by Pischel, Kiel, 1886 (cf. Journal\r\nof German Or. Soc., 1888, p. 296 ff., 425 ff.; Vienna Or. Journal,\r\nii. p. 151 ff.). Rudrata Çatananda's Kavyalamkara (ed. in Kavyamala)\r\nbelongs to the ninth century. Dhanamjaya's Daçarupa, on the ten\r\nkinds of drama, belongs to the tenth century (ed. Hall, 1865;\r\nwith comm. Nirnaya Sagara Press, Bombay, 1897). The Kavyaprakaça\r\nby Mammata and Alata dates from about 1100 (ed. in the Pandit,\r\n1897). The Sahityadarpana was composed in Eastern Bengal about 1450\r\nA.D., by Viçvanatha Kaviraja (ed. J. Vidyasagara, Calcutta, 1895;\r\ntrans. by Ballantyne in Bibl. Ind.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATHEMATICS AND ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\nThe only work dealing with this subject as a whole is Thibaut's\r\nAstronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik, in Bühler-Kielhorn's\r\nEncyclopædia, 1899 (full bibliography). See also Cantor, Geschichte\r\nder Mathematik, pp. 505-562, Leipsic, 1880. Mathematics are dealt with\r\nin special chapters of the works of the early Indian astronomers. In\r\nalgebra they attained an eminence far exceeding anything ever achieved\r\nby the Greeks. The earliest works of scientific Indian astronomy\r\n(after about 300 A.D.) were four treatises called Siddhantas; only one,\r\nthe Suryasiddhanta (ed. and trans. by Whitney, Journ. Am. Or. Soc.,\r\nvol. vi.), has survived. The doctrines of such early works were reduced\r\nto a more concise and practical form by Aryabhata, born, as he tells\r\nus himself, at Pataliputra in 476 A.D. He maintained the rotation\r\nof the earth round its axis (a doctrine not unknown to the Greeks),\r\nand explained the cause of eclipses of the sun and moon. Mathematics\r\nare treated in the third section of his work, the Aryabhatiya\r\n(ed. with comm. by Kern, Leyden, 1874; math. section trans. by Rodet,\r\nJournal Asiatique, 1879). Varaha Mihira, born near Ujjain, began his\r\ncalculations about 505 A.D., and, according to one of his commentators,\r\ndied in 587 A.D. He composed four works, written for the most part in\r\nthe Arya metre; three are astrological: the Brihat-samhita (ed. Kern,\r\nBibl. Ind., 1864, 1865, trans. in Journ. As. Soc., vol. iv.; new\r\ned. with comm. of Bhattotpala by S. Dvivedi, Benares, 1895-97),\r\nthe Brihaj-jataka (or Hora-çastra, trans. by C. Jyer, Madras, 1885),\r\nand the Laghu-jataka (partly trans. by Weber, Ind. Stud., vol. ii.,\r\nand by Jacobi, 1872). His Pancha-siddhantika (ed. and for the most\r\npart trans. by Thibaut and S. Dvivedi, Benares, 1889), based on five\r\nsiddhantas, is a karana or practical astronomical treatise. Another\r\ndistinguished astronomer was Brahmagupta, who, born in 598 A.D., wrote,\r\nbesides a karana, his Brahma Sphuta-siddhanta when thirty years old\r\n(chaps. xii. and xviii. are mathematical). The last eminent Indian\r\nastronomer was Bhaskaracharya, born in 1114 A.D. His Siddhanta-çiromani\r\nhas enjoyed more authority in India than any other astronomical work\r\nexcept the Surya-siddhanta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINE.\r\n\r\nIndian medical science must have begun to develop before the beginning\r\nof our era, for one of its chief authorities, Charaka, was, according\r\nto the Chinese translation of the Buddhist Tripitaka, the official\r\nphysician of King Kanishka in the first century A.D. His work, the\r\nCharaka-samhita, has been edited several times: by J. Vidyasagara,\r\n2nd ed., Calcutta, 1896, by Gupta, Calcutta, 1897, with comm. by\r\nC. Dutta, Calcutta, 1892-1893; trans. by A. C. Kaviratna, Calcutta,\r\n1897. Suçruta, the next great authority, seems to have lived not\r\nlater than the fourth century A.D., as the Bower MS. (probably\r\nfifth century A.D.) contains passages not only parallel to,\r\nbut verbally agreeing with, passages in the works of Charaka and\r\nSuçruta. (The Suçruta-samhita, ed. by J. Vidyasagara, Calcutta, 3rd\r\ned., 1889; A. C. Kaviratna, Calcutta, 1888-95; trans. by Dutta, 1883,\r\nChattopadhyaya, 1891, Hoernle, 1897, Calcutta.) The next best known\r\nmedical writer is Vagbhata, author of the Ashtanga-hridaya (ed.,\r\nwith comm. of Arunadatta, by A. M. Kunte, Bombay, Nir. Sag. Press,\r\n1891).
