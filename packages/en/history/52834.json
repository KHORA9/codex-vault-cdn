Puerile as are many of these subjects, they\r\nbecome interesting when a comparison is instituted amongst them as\r\nthey exist in various countries. It is then seen how wide is their\r\nspread--how, for example, the same incident in a fairy tale, modified\r\naccording to the manners and customs of the people by whom it is\r\nrelated, extends from the remotest east to the westernmost confines\r\nof Europe, and is even found occasionally to re-appear among the wild\r\ntribes of the American Continent, and the isolated inhabitants of\r\nPolynesia. The ethnologist may find in this an argument for the common\r\norigin of all nations, and their gradual spread from one central\r\npoint,--the philosopher and psychologist may speculate on the wonderful\r\nconstruction of the human mind, and, throwing aside the idea of the\r\nunity of the race, may attribute the similarities of tradition to an\r\ninnate set of ideas, which find their expression in certain definite\r\nforms,--while the historian and antiquary may sometimes discover\r\nin these popular traditions, a confirmation or explanation of some\r\ndoubtful point. Lastly, he whose sole object is amusement, and whose\r\ntaste is not entirely vitiated by the exaggerated and exciting fiction\r\nof modern times, will turn with pleasure to the simple tales which have\r\namused his childhood, and which are ever fresh and ever new.\r\n\r\nMuch of this ancient lore has already perished, and much is every\r\nday disappearing before the influence of the printing press, and the\r\nconsequent extension of education. This would scarcely be regretted,\r\nif, at the same time, the degrading superstitions with which much\r\nof these old traditions are mixed up could disappear with them, but\r\nunfortunately we find by experience that this is not the case, and that\r\nthese popular delusions only disappear in one form to re-appear in\r\nanother, equally, if not more, dangerous.\r\n\r\nA desire to preserve, before they were entirely forgotten, some of the\r\ntraditional stories, and other matters connected with the folk-lore of\r\nmy native island, induced me to attempt to collect and record them,\r\nbut I have found the task, though pleasant, by no means easy. The last\r\nfifty years has made an immense difference here as elsewhere. The\r\ninflux of a stranger population, and with it the growth and spread of\r\nthe English tongue, has changed, or modified considerably, the manners\r\nand ideas of the people, more particularly in the town. Old customs\r\nare forgotten by the rising generation, what amused their fathers\r\nand mothers possesses little or no interest for their children, and\r\ngradually even the recollection of these matters dies away. There are\r\ngood grounds for supposing that, although the belief in witchcraft\r\nattained its greatest development in the century which succeeded the\r\nReformation, and was as much the creed of the clergy as of the laity,\r\nother popular superstitions were looked upon with disfavour, and\r\nespecially all those customs which were in any way, even remotely,\r\nconnected with the observances of the ancient form of religion.\r\nThe rapid spread of dissent among the middle and lower classes of\r\nsociety within the last half century has certainly not had the effect\r\nof diminishing popular credulity with respect to the existence of\r\nsorcerers and their supernatural powers, but, by discouraging the\r\namusements in which the young naturally delight, and in which the\r\nelders took part, it has broken one of the links which connected the\r\npresent with the past.\r\n\r\nDoubtless did one know where to look for it much might still be gleaned\r\namong the peasantry, but all who have attempted to make collections\r\nof popular lore know how difficult it is to make this class of people\r\nopen themselves. They fear ridicule, and cannot conceive what interest\r\none can have in seeking for information on subjects which--whatever\r\nmay be their own private opinion--they have been taught to speak of as\r\nfoolishness.\r\n\r\nSome of the stories in the following compilation were related to me by\r\nan old and valued servant of the family, Rachel du Port, others were\r\nkindly communicated to me by ladies[1] and others, who had derived\r\ntheir information from similar sources, and whose names I have appended\r\nto them, and much is the result of my own research and observation. The\r\nsubject matter of the following pages, having been collected at various\r\ntimes, and written down as it came to hand, is not arranged as it ought\r\nto be, and there are necessarily some repetitions. Whether, after all,\r\nthe work is worthy of the time that has been spent on it, the reader\r\nmust decide for himself. Suffice it to say that as far as regards\r\nmyself it has afforded an occupation and amusement.\r\n\r\nEDGAR MACCULLOCH.\r\n\r\n_Guernsey, February, 1864._\r\n\r\n[1] The legends collected by Miss Lane (Mrs. Lane Clarke) were\r\nsubsequently published by her in the charming little book called\r\n_Folk-Lore of Guernsey and Sark_, of which two Editions have been\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Edgar MacCulloch at his death, which occurred July 31st, 1896,\r\nbequeathed his manuscript collection of Guernsey Folk-Lore to the Royal\r\nCourt of Guernsey, of which he had been for so many years Member and\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThis collection was subsequently handed over to me by Sir T. Godfrey\r\nCarey, then Bailiff, and the other Members of the Court, to transcribe\r\nfor publication: it was contained in three manuscript books, closely\r\nwritten on both sides of the pages, and interspersed with innumerable\r\nscraps of paper, containing notes, additions and corrections; as Sir\r\nEdgar himself says in his preface, the items were written down as\r\ncollected, local customs, fairy tales, witch stories, one after the\r\nother, with no attempt at classification. In literally transcribing\r\nthem I have endeavoured to place them under their different headings,\r\nas recommended by the English Folk-Lore Society, and have inserted the\r\nnotes in their proper places; and I am responsible for the choice of\r\nthe quotations heading the various chapters. In every other particular\r\nI have copied the manuscript word for word as I received it. It took me\r\nover three years to transcribe, and was placed by the Royal Court in\r\nthe printer’s hands in February, 1900.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that three sizes of type have been used throughout\r\nthe book; Sir Edgar MacCulloch’s subject matter has been printed in the\r\nlargest, the Author’s notes to his own text being in the medium, while\r\nthe notes printed in the smallest type contain additional legends and\r\nsuperstitions, which have been told me, or collected for me, by and\r\nfrom the country people, and which I have added, thereby making the\r\ncollection more complete. Also, at the end of the book, is an appendix\r\ncontaining a few of the legends collected by myself, which were too\r\nlong to insert as notes, and a small collection of old Guernsey songs,\r\nwhich I have written down from the lips of the older inhabitants, and\r\nwhich, in one of the last conversations I had with Sir Edgar MacCulloch\r\non the subject, he strongly recommended should be included in any\r\ncollection of Guernsey Folk-Lore that should ever be published.\r\n\r\nI was well aware of the difficulties of the task which I undertook,\r\nand how unworthy I, a mere novice, was to edit the work of so eminent\r\nan antiquary as the late Sir Edgar MacCulloch; but it was represented\r\nto me that I was one of the very few who took any interest in the\r\nfast vanishing traditions of the island, that I understood the local\r\ndialect, and that I had had many conversations and much assistance from\r\nSir Edgar MacCulloch during his lifetime on the subject; and, more\r\nespecially, that if I did not do it no one else would undertake it, and\r\nthus the result of Sir Edgar’s labours would be lost to the island.\r\nThis, I trust may be my excuse for assuming so great a responsibility.\r\nI feel I should never have accomplished it without the unfailing\r\nassistance and kindness of H. A. Giffard, Esq., the present Bailiff of\r\nGuernsey, and John de Garis, Esq., Jurat of the Royal Court, members\r\nof the Folk-Lore Committee, who have, in the midst of their own hard\r\nwork, gone through all the proofs in the most untiring manner, and have\r\nhelped me in every possible way.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations are from photographs, collected by myself, of old\r\npictures and views illustrating the Guernsey of which Sir Edgar\r\nMacCulloch wrote, and which is now so sadly changed, and it will be\r\nnoticed that in various instances where Sir Edgar writes of “wooded\r\nvalleys and cornfields, etc.,” in 1864, now (1903) there are nothing\r\nbut quarries or greenhouses.\r\n\r\nI am very grateful to Mr. Grigg, of High Street, for allowing me to use\r\nthe photographs, taken by his grandson, Mr. William Guerin, of original\r\npictures of Guernsey in his possession; also to Mr. Edgar Dupuy, of the\r\nArcade, and Mr. Singleton, photographer, for the use of photographs\r\ndone by them of Guernsey scenery.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude without thanking the many friends who have helped me\r\nby collecting folk-lore and songs, especially I must mention my cousin,\r\nthe late Miss Ernestine Le Pelley, who gathered many traditions for\r\nme from the west coast of the island, and who, alas! never lived to\r\nsee the book, in which she took so great an interest, in print. The\r\nlate Miss Anne Chepmell, who died in 1899, also gave me most valuable\r\nassistance, and so have also Mrs. Le Patourel, Mrs. Charles Marquand,\r\nMrs. Mollet, Miss Margaret Mauger, Mrs. Sidney Tostevin, and many\r\nothers in St. Martin’s parish, who have racked their brains to remember\r\nfor me “chû que j’ai ouï dire à ma gran’mère.”\r\n\r\nEDITH F.

Many of these customs have, it is well known,\r\ndescended to us from pagan times. The Church, unable altogether to\r\neradicate them, has, in some cases, tacitly sanctioned, in others\r\nincorporated them into her own system. At the Reformation some of\r\nthese observances were thought to savour too strongly of their pagan\r\norigin, or to be too nearly allied to papal superstitions. Accordingly\r\nwe find that in a country like Scotland, where reformation amounted\r\nto a total subversion of all the forms which had hitherto subsisted,\r\neven such a festival as Christmas was proscribed, and of course with\r\nit have fallen all the joyous observances which characterize that\r\nseason in England. In Guernsey, from the reign of Queen Elizabeth\r\nto the Restoration of Charles II., the Presbyterian form of Church\r\ngovernment reigned supreme, and the ministers seem to have set their\r\nfaces strongly against anything which in their estimation could be\r\nlooked upon as superstitious. In the reformed churches of Geneva and\r\nFrance, whose discipline the islands had adopted, all Saints’ days\r\nhad been abolished, and, although the greater festivals of Christmas\r\nand Whitsuntide were retained, there were those in the insular\r\ncongregations who would gladly have seen these also discarded. Dr.\r\nPeter Heylin, who visited the islands in 1629, tells us how “the\r\nMinisters were much heartened in their inconformity by the practice\r\nof De La Place, who, stomaching his disappointment in the loss of\r\nthe Deanery of Jersey, abandoned his native country, and retired to\r\nGuernsey, where he breathed nothing but confusion to the English\r\nLiturgy, the person of the new Dean (David Bandinel), and the change\r\nof government. Whereas there was a lecture weekly every Thursday in\r\nthe Church of St. Peter’s-on-the-Sea, when once the feast of Christ’s\r\nNativity fell upon that day, he rather chose to disappoint the hearers,\r\nand put off the sermon, than that the least honour should reflect on\r\nthat ancient festival.”\r\n\r\nWe find that in the year 1622 the Clergy of the Island complained to\r\nthe Royal Court of the practice that existed in the rural parishes of\r\npeople going about on the Eve of St. John and on the last day of the\r\nyear begging from house to house--a custom, which, in their opinion,\r\nsavoured much of the old leaven of Popery, and which, under the guise\r\nof charity, introduced and nourished superstition among their flocks;\r\nwhereupon an ordinance was framed and promulgated, forbidding the\r\npractice under the penalty of a fine or whipping.\r\n\r\n    “Les Chefs Plaids Cappitaux d’apprés le jour St. Michell tenus\r\n    le Lundy dernier jour du mois de Septembre, l’an 1622, par\r\n    Amice de Carteret, Esq., Bailly, présents à ce les Sieurs\r\n    Pierre Careye, Thomas Beauvoir, Thomas de l’Isle, Thomas\r\n    Andros, Eleazar Le Marchant, Jean Bonamy, Jean Fautrart, Jean\r\n    Blondel, et Jacques Guille, Jurez.\r\n\r\n    “Sur la remonstrance de Messieurs les Ministres de ceste isle,\r\n    que la vueille du jour St. Jean et celle du jour de l’an se\r\n    fait une geuzerie ordinaire par les paroisses des champs en\r\n    ceste isle; laquelle se resent grandement du viel levain de\r\n    la Papaulté, au moyen de quoy, soubs ombre de charité, la\r\n    superstition est introduite et nourye parmy nous, au grand\r\n    destourbier du service de Dieu et manifeste scandalle des gens\r\n    de bien; desirants iceux Ministres qu’il pleust à la Cour y\r\n    apporter remede par les voyes les plus convenables--A sur ce\r\n    Esté par exprès deffendu à toutes personnes qu’ils n’ayent\r\n    en aulcun des susdits jours à geuzer, ny demander par voye\r\n    d’aumosne aulcune chose, de peur d’entretenir la susdite\r\n    superstition, à peine de soixante sous tournois d’amende sur\r\n    les personnes capables de payer la dite amende, et s’ils\r\n    n’ont moyen de payer, et qu’ils soyent d’aage, d’estre punis\r\n    corporellement à discretion de Justice; et quant aux personnes\r\n    qui ne seront point d’aage, d’estre fouettés publicquement en\r\n    l’escolle de leur paroisse.”\r\n\r\nA little later, begging at Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials was\r\nprohibited on like grounds, and about the same time sumptuary laws\r\nwere passed controlling the expenses on these occasions, and limiting\r\nthe guests that might be invited to persons in the nearest degrees of\r\nconsanguinity. Dancing and singing were also forbidden, and any persons\r\nconvicted of these heinous crimes were to perform public penance in\r\ntheir parish church, barefooted and bareheaded, enveloped in a sheet,\r\nand holding a lighted torch in their hand.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore to be wondered at if many observances and customs,\r\ninnocent in themselves, came to be forgotten, and this would be more\r\nespecially the case with such as were connected with the festivals of\r\nthe Church. Still some few observances and superstitions have survived,\r\nand of these we will now endeavour to give the best account we can.\r\nWe would, however, previously remark that the Guernsey people are an\r\neminently holiday-loving race, and that, notwithstanding their long\r\nsubjection to Presbyterian rule, and the ascetic spirit of modern\r\ndissent, the love of amusement is still strong in them. Christmas Day\r\nand the day following, the first two days of the year, the Monday and\r\nTuesday at Easter and Whitsuntide, Midsummer Day and the day after, are\r\nall seasons when there is an almost total cessation of work, and all\r\ngive themselves up to gaiety--and the household must be poor indeed\r\nwhere a cake is not made on these occasions.\r\n\r\nBut before launching into a description of their ceremonies, festivals,\r\nand superstitions, perhaps it might prove of interest if we here\r\nattempt to give a slight description of the dress of our island\r\nforefathers at different periods, during the last three hundred years,\r\ndrawn from various sources.\r\n\r\nWe will begin by an extract from a letter written by Mr. George\r\nMétivier, that eminent antiquary, historian, and philologist, to the\r\n_Star_ of June 20th, 1831:--\r\n\r\n\r\nA Guernseyman Three Centuries Ago.\r\n\r\n    “Knows’t me not by my clothes?\r\n            No, nor thy tailor.”\r\n\r\n                   --_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n“Suppose we conjure up a Guernseyman in his winter dress--a specimen\r\nof the outer man, such as it appeared on high-days and holidays\r\n‘sighing like a furnace to its mistress’ eye-brow’ in the reign of\r\nthe most puissant King Henry VIII., and under the long dynasty of the\r\nfive Westons--(James Guille, the son-in-law of one of them, was then\r\nBailiff). It is probable that the insular gentleman, in the highest\r\nsense of that important word, copied the dress of his English and\r\nNorman friends, as well as their manner, whether in good or evil.\r\n\r\n“Similitude excludes peculiarity: we have therefore nothing to do with\r\nMonsieur le Gouverneur, or Monsieur le Baillif, or the most refined\r\nin wardrobe matters of his learned assessors. It is certain, however,\r\nthat the generality of our ancestors--‘l’honnête’ and sometimes ‘le\r\nprudhomme’--derived the materials and cut of their raiment from St.\r\nMalo’s--whence their very houses were occasionally imported--ready\r\nbuilt. We are indebted to a writer of the Elizabethan era for the\r\nsource of the following portrait.\r\n\r\n“_Le cadaû_,[2] the chief article of a Guernseyman’s winter costume,\r\nexactly resembled, both in name and form, the primitive Irish mantle.\r\nGenerally composed of wool, or of a kind of shag-rug, bordered with\r\nfur, it descended in ample folds till it reached the heels. A surface\r\nof such extraordinary dimensions might have exposed the wearer to some\r\ninconvenience in stormy weather: but our fathers, no novices in the\r\nart of cloak-wearing, knew how to furl and unfurl this magnificent\r\nwrapper, and suit its folds and plaits to all changes of the season.\r\nIn the first Charles’ reign, the Jersey farmers, who still ‘bartered\r\nthe surplusage of their corn with the Spanish merchants at St. Malo’s,’\r\nwere far better acquainted with that long-robed nation than we can\r\nnow pretend to be. To the _cadaû_ was attached a _carapouce_[3]--an\r\nenormous hood. If made of serge or good cloth, it was still a\r\n_carapouce_; if the material was coarse--such as friars wore through\r\nhumility, or mariners and fishermen from motives of economy--the\r\n_carapouce_ degenerated into a _couaille_. The sea-farer’s top-coat\r\naffords an instance, not yet quite obsolete, of this island’s former\r\npartiality for Armorican tailors, dresses, and names--a Tardif and a\r\nDorey will show you their _grigo_.[4]\r\n\r\n“The residence of mind--for our ancestor, this ‘fine fleur de Norman,’\r\nprobably had one--was not forgotten. Muffled up in a voluminous hood,\r\nlike that of a Spanish _frayle_, it was further protected by the\r\nnative wig--‘la perruque naturelle’--and kept warm by a bonnet, part\r\nof the _cadaû_ uniform, yclept _la barrette_. The original _biread_--a\r\nlay mitre, not then peculiar to Ireland--was a conical cap, somewhat\r\nresembling the foraging military bonnet.…\r\n\r\n“His Grace, or Holiness--we are a bad hand at title dealing--the Right\r\nReverend Primate of Normandy, having once preached a most godlie\r\nand comfortable sermon against long bushy perriwigs, descended from\r\nhis pulpit in the Cathedral of Rouen, scissors in hand, then doing\r\nmerciless execution therewith on King Henry I. and all the princely\r\nand noble heads committed to his charge, exhorted them to perpetrate a\r\ncrime for which that traitor deserved to lose his own.”\r\n\r\n    ‘The people vary too,\r\n    Just as their princes do.’\r\n\r\nSo sings Nat Wanley, who was no nightingale; but even when the eighth\r\nHarry, and the whole nation, aping him, shore their beautiful locks,\r\nin spite of many a fond wife, what luxuriant male tresses continued to\r\nflourish in the Norman Isles! Our friend of the _Star_ may remember the\r\ntime when the dangling chevelure of our village beaux and ‘Soudards\r\nde Milice,’ though confined with whipcord on working days, was\r\nregularly let loose in honour of Sunday and other grand festivals.\r\nIt is true that burly wife-killing Tudor did interfere. Ah, woe is\r\nme! He requireth from his Normans as well as from his Irish lieges\r\n‘conformitie in order and apparel with them that be civill people’\r\n(A.D. 1537). At least, the alteration took place in both places exactly\r\nat the same period; for the censorious terms of this statute were\r\nneither applicable nor applied to our ancestors. Indeed, from the size\r\nand structure of here and there a yeoman’s house, richly overlaid with\r\nthe golden moss of antiquity, it would seem that the dwellings of our\r\npeasantry were very different from the mud-built[5] and chimneyless\r\ncottages of old England. (Such as Jean Lestocq’s house in la Vingtaine\r\ndes Charités, Câtel--the traditional residence of an individual\r\nmentioned in a spirited ballad of the year 1371).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ruins of an Old Guernsey House, Les Caretiers, St.\r\nSampson’s.]\r\n\r\n“Be this as it may, ‘Though the language of such as dwell in these\r\nIsles was French, the wearing of their haire long, and their attire was\r\n_all after the Irish guise_ till the reigne of King Henrie the VIII.’\r\nThese are the words of Ralph Holinshed, who quotes Leland.”\r\n\r\nThe following description of the dress of the people of Sark in 1673,\r\nis taken from a letter in the Harleian MSS.; it is quoted in full\r\nin the “Historical Sketch of the Island of Sark,” in the _Guernsey\r\nMagazine_ for 1874:--\r\n\r\n“Sure I am the genius of the people cannot but be docile, since they\r\nare naturally of a courteous affable temper, and the least tainted\r\nwith pride that ever I saw any of their nation; that apish variety of\r\nfantastic fashions, wherewith Paris is justly accused to infect all\r\nEurope, has here no footing, where every one retains the same garb\r\ntheir ancestors wore in the days of Hugh Capet and King Pippin; so that\r\nI can give small encouragement to any of the Knights of the Thimble to\r\ntransport themselves hither, where cucumbers are like to be more plenty\r\nthan in the back-side of St. Clement’s; each man religiously preserving\r\nhis vast blue trunk-breeches, and a coat almost like a Dutch frau’s\r\nvest, or one of your waterman’s liveries. Nor are the women behindhand\r\nwith them in their hospital-gowns of the same colour, wooden sandals,\r\nwhite stockings and red petticoats, so mean they are scarce worth\r\ntaking up. Both sexes on festivals wear large ruffs, and the women,\r\ninstead of hats or hoods, truss up their hair, the more genteel sort in\r\na kind of cabbage net; those of meaner fortunes in a piece of linen;\r\nperhaps an old dish-clout turned out of service; or the fag-end of a\r\ntable-cloth, that had escaped the persecution of washing ever since the\r\nReformation; this they, tying on the top, make it shew like a Turkish\r\nturban, but that part of it hangs down their backs like a veil.”\r\n\r\nIn Jersey the “fantastic fashions” of Paris seem to have penetrated\r\nat an early date, for on the 22nd of September, 1636, a sumptuary law\r\nwas passed, forbidding anyone, male or female, to put on garments\r\n“au-dessus de sa condition;” and also forbidding women to ornament\r\ntheir bonnets with lace costing more than “quinze sols” (a “sol” was\r\nworth about a franc) a yard, or to put on silken hoods, the wear of\r\nwhich was reserved for ladies of quality. A short time after this\r\nordinance was passed, a Madame Lemprière, wife of the Seigneur de\r\nRosel, noticed in church, one Sunday, a peasant woman wearing the most\r\nmagnificent lace in her bonnet. She waited for her after church, tore\r\nit off before the whole congregation, covering her with abuse the\r\nwhile; and her friends stood round and applauded her action!\r\n\r\nThe most picturesque of our island costumes must have been that of the\r\nAlderney women in the last century as described by Mrs. Lane-Clarke in\r\nher “Guide to Alderney.” “A scarlet cloth petticoat and jacket, a large\r\nruff round their necks, fastened under the chin by a black ribbon, or\r\ngold hook, and a round linen cap, stiffened so much as to be taken off\r\nor put on as a man’s hat. On one occasion, when the island was menaced\r\nby a French man-of-war, the Governor ordered out all the women in\r\ntheir scarlet dresses, and, disposing them skilfully upon the heights,\r\neffectually deceived the enemy with the appearance of his forces.”\r\n\r\nAt about this period the dress of the old Guernsey farmer was “a large\r\ncocked hat, and thin ‘queue à la française,’ a long blue coat with\r\nbrass buttons, flowered waistcoat and jean trousers. Of course this was\r\nonly for Sundays and festivals. The women wore the black silk plaited\r\nGuernsey bonnet, accompanied by a close mob cap underneath, with a\r\nnarrow muslin border; plain on the forehead and temples, but plaited\r\nfrom the ears to the chin. A petticoat of black stuff, thickly quilted,\r\nthe gown--of an old fashion chintz pattern--open in front, and tucked\r\ninto the pocket holes of the petticoat; the boddice open in front to\r\nthe waist, with a coloured or starched muslin handkerchief in lieu of\r\na habit-shirt; tight sleeves terminating just below the elbow; blue\r\nworsted stockings, with black velvet shoes and buckles.”\r\n\r\nThis description is taken from an old guide book of 1841. The dress was\r\nrapidly becoming obsolete then, and has now, like almost every other\r\nrelic of the past, completely disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe will now return to the account of our local feasts and festivals.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the commencement of the ecclesiastical year--the holy\r\nseason of Advent--the first day that claims our attention is that\r\ndedicated to Saint Thomas, not because of any public observance\r\nconnected with it, but on account of its being supposed to be a time\r\nwhen the secrets of futurity may be inquired into.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of “Love Spells” we shall describe the superstitious\r\npractices to which, it is said, some young women still resort, in order\r\nto ascertain their future destiny.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that some of these observances have been kept\r\nalive by the constant communication that has always existed in times\r\nof peace between the islands and continental Normandy, not a few\r\nyoung people of both sexes coming over from the mainland to seek for\r\nemployment as farm servants.\r\n\r\n[2] A covering or defence. (Celtic.)\r\n\r\n[3] _Carabouss bras._ (Breton).\r\n\r\n[4] A wrapper (Celtic). These terms are still used in the country.\r\n\r\n[5] At least wattle-built and plastered with mud, if not mud-built\r\naltogether. Holinshed exclaims against the _innovation_ of chimneys,\r\nand regrets that “willow-built houses” are no longer fashionable.\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Longue Veille.\r\n\r\n    “Meanwhile the village rouses up the fire;\r\n    While well attested, and as well believ’d,\r\n    Heard solemn, goes the goblin story round;\r\n    Till superstitious horror creeps o’er all.”\r\n\r\n                                  --_Thompson._\r\n\r\nIn former days the most lucrative occupation of the people was that of\r\nknitting woollen goods for the English and French markets. This branch\r\nof industry was of great importance--in fact, after the decay of the\r\nfisheries, which followed the discovery of Newfoundland, it constituted\r\nthe staple trade of the island, and the memory of the manufacture still\r\nsubsists in the name of “Guernsey jackets” and “Jerseys,” given to\r\nthe close-fitting knitted frocks worn by sailors. So highly were the\r\nGuernsey woollen goods esteemed that they were considered a fitting\r\npresent for Royalty, and in 1556 Queen Mary[6] did not disdain to\r\nreceive from Sir Leonard Chamberlain, Governor of the Island, four\r\nwaistcoats, four pair of sleeves, and four pair of hose of “Garnsey\r\nmaking.”[7] In the accounts of the Royal Scotch wardrobe for the year\r\n1578, mention is made of woollen hose and gloves of Garnsey.[8] In\r\n1586, the keeper of Queen Elizabeth’s wardrobe paid the high price of\r\ntwenty shillings for one pair of knitted hose “_de facturâ Garnescie_.”\r\nIt is true that these are described as having the upper part and the\r\nclocks of silk. (“Accounts of the Keeper of the Gt. Wardrobe, Elizabeth\r\nXXVIII. to XXIX., A.D. 1586”). And finally the unfortunate Mary Stuart\r\nwore at her execution a pair of white Guernsey hose.\r\n\r\nThe sheep kept in those days in the island were few in quantity, of\r\nan inferior breed, described by old writers as having four or more\r\nhorns, producing coarse scanty wool, far from sufficient to furnish the\r\nsupply of raw material required to meet the demand of the manufactured\r\narticle. It was necessary therefore to have recourse to England, but\r\nthe restrictive laws of that day prohibited the exportation of wool,\r\nand it was only by special Acts of Parliament that a certain quantity,\r\nstrictly limited, was allowed annually to leave the kingdom for the use\r\nof the islands. The Governor who could succeed by his representations\r\nin getting this quantity increased was sure to win the lasting\r\ngratitude of the people.\r\n\r\nMen and women of all ages engaged in this manufacture, and time was so\r\nstrictly economised that the farmer’s wife, riding into market with\r\nher well stored paniers, knitted as the old horse jogged on through\r\nthe narrow roads, and the fisherman, after having set his lines, and\r\nanchored his boat to wait for the turn of the tide, occupied the\r\nleisure hour in fashioning a pair of stockings, or a frock.\r\n\r\nIn the long winter evenings neighbours were in the habit of meeting at\r\neach other’s houses in turn, and while the matrons took their places on\r\nthe “lit de fouaille,” and the elderly men occupied the stools set in\r\nthe deeper recess of the chimney, the young men and maidens gathered\r\ntogether on the floor, and by the dim light of the “crâsset,”[9]\r\nplied their knitting, sang their songs, and told their stories--the\r\nsongs and tales that appear later on in this collection. Our thrifty\r\nancestors too were well imbued with the wisdom of the old saw that bids\r\none “take care of the pence,” and the saving of fuel and oil, which\r\nwas affected by working in company under the same roof, entered for\r\nsomething in their calculations. These assemblies were called “veilles”\r\nor “veillies,” and were well adapted to keep up a pleasant neighbourly\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nThe wares thus made were brought into town for sale on the Saturday,\r\nbut there was one day in the year when a special market or fair for\r\nthese goods was held, and that was the day before Christmas. The night\r\nprevious to that--the 23rd December--was employed in preparing and\r\npacking up the articles, and, being the termination of their labours\r\nfor the year, was made an opportunity for a feast. Masters were in the\r\nhabit of regaling their servants--merchants treated those with whom\r\nthey had dealings--and neighbours clubbed together to supply the means\r\nof spending a joyous night. It may be that the restraint imposed by the\r\nPuritan Clergy--de la Marche, La Place, and others--on all convivial\r\nmeetings connected in any way with religious observances, caused this\r\noccasion for rejoicing--which could not by any possibility be branded\r\nwith the imputation of superstition--to be more highly appreciated than\r\nit would otherwise have been, and to replace in some degree the usual\r\nfestivities of the season.\r\n\r\nAlthough the manufacture of woollen goods as a staple article of\r\ntrade has come to an end, and the social “veilles” are no longer kept\r\nup, “la longue veille,” or the evening of the 23rd of December, is\r\nstill observed as an occasion for family gatherings in many Guernsey\r\nhouseholds, though there is perhaps not one person in twenty who\r\ncan tell the origin of the custom. Mulled wine, highly spiced and\r\nsweetened, and always drunk out of coffee cups, with mild cheese and a\r\npeculiar sort of biscuit--called emphatically “Guernsey biscuit”--is\r\nconsidered quite indispensable on this evening, and indeed on all\r\noccasions of family rejoicing; while on every afternoon of the 23rd\r\nof December the old country people were met riding home from town\r\nwith their panniers full of provisions for the night. The next day,\r\nChristmas Eve, is called the “surveille,” and the town on that evening\r\nis flocked with pleasure-seekers, buying and eating chestnuts and\r\noranges.\r\n\r\n[6] I am indebted to Mr. Bury Palliser, the accomplished author of “A\r\nHistory of Lace,” for these interesting particulars concerning the\r\nancient staple manufacture of these islands.\r\n\r\n[7] New Year gifts to Queen Mary (Tudor), 1556.

Ours was suspended from a hook or a cord along\r\nwhich it was pulled to the required point, and was rounded at one end\r\nand pointed at the other, and filled with oil. It is derived from the\r\nFr. “creuset” from Latin _crux_ a cross, because anciently crucibles\r\nand all vessels for melting metals were marked with a cross.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas and New Year.\r\n\r\n    “Every season\r\n    Shall have its suited pastime; even winter,\r\n    In its deep noon, when mountains piled with snow\r\n    And choked up valleys from our mansion, bar\r\n    All entrance, and nor guest nor traveller\r\n    Sounds at our gate; the empty hall forsaken,\r\n    In some warm chamber, by the crackling fire,\r\n    We’ll hold our little, snug, domestic court,\r\n    Plying our work with song and tale between.”\r\n\r\n                             --_Joanna Baillie._\r\n\r\nFrom St. Thomas’ Day to New Year’s Eve is considered to be a season\r\nwhen the powers of darkness are more than usually active, and it is\r\nsupposed to be dangerous to be out after dark.[10] Men returning home\r\non these nights have been led astray by the “faeu Bellengier” or Will\r\no’ the wisp, and when they believed themselves to be close to their\r\nown doors have found themselves, they knew not how, in quite another\r\npart of the island. Others have been driven almost crazy by finding\r\nthemselves followed or preceded by large black dogs, which no threats\r\ncould scare away and on which no blows could take effect. Some find\r\ntheir path beset by white rabbits that go hopping along just under\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that just at midnight on Christmas Eve all the\r\ncattle kneel and adore the newborn Saviour.[11] The considerate farmer\r\nwill take care to place an extra quantity of litter in the stall when\r\nhe shuts up his beasts for the night, but none would venture to wait\r\nand see the event. Such prying curiosity is too dangerous, for it is\r\nrelated how, on one occasion, a man who professed to disbelieve the\r\nfact remained watching till the witching hour. What he saw was never\r\nknown, for, as he was leaving the stable, the door slammed violently,\r\nand he fell dead on the threshold.\r\n\r\nIt is also said that, on the same night, and at the same hour, all\r\nwater turns to wine. A woman, prompted by curiosity, determined to\r\nverify the truth of this allegation. Just at midnight, she proceeded\r\nto draw a bucket of water from the well, when she heard a voice\r\naddressing her in the following words:--\r\n\r\n    “Toute l’eau se tourne en vin,\r\n    Et tu es proche de ta fin.”\r\n\r\nShe fell down struck with a mortal disease, and before the end of the\r\nyear was a corpse.[12]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the supernatural terrors of this night, groups of young\r\nmen and women from all parts of the country flock into town after their\r\nday’s work is done, and assemble in crowds in the market place, where\r\nthey regale on oranges and roasted chestnuts. The public-houses profit\r\ngreatly by their presence; rendered valiant by their potations, and\r\nfeeling security in numbers, they return home at a late hour, singing\r\nin chorus some interminable ditty, which, if goblins have any ear for\r\nmusic, must certainly have the effect of driving them far away.\r\n\r\nBy those in easy circumstances Christmas Day is now celebrated much\r\nas it is in England. The houses are decorated with holly and other\r\nevergreens--the same substantial fare loads the hospitable board,\r\npresents of meat or geese are sent to poor dependants, and families who\r\nare dispersed re-assemble at the same table. It is still customary for\r\nthe poorer classes among the peasantry, who at any other season of the\r\nyear would be ashamed to beg, to go about from door to door some days\r\nbefore Christmas, asking for alms under the name of “Noel,” in order to\r\nbe able to add something to their scanty fare; and before grates and\r\nsea-coal became so common it was usual to reserve a large log of wood\r\nto be burned on the hearth at Christmas. This was called “le tronquet\r\nde Noel” and is evidently the same as the Yule log of the North of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbouring island of Alderney, one of the favourite diversions\r\nin the merry meetings at this festive season was the assuming of\r\nvarious disguises. Porphyrius, a native of Tyre, and a disciple of\r\nLonginus in the year 223 speaks of the “Feast of Mithras, or the Sun,\r\nwhere men were in the habit of disguising themselves as all sorts of\r\nanimals--lions, lionesses, crows;” and St. Sampson, on his second visit\r\nto Jersey, gave gilded medals to the children on condition that they\r\nstayed away from these fêtes; so says Mr. Métivier in one of his early\r\nletters to the _Gazette_.\r\n\r\nOn the last night of the year it was customary (and the practice has\r\nnot altogether fallen into desuetude) for boys to dress up a grotesque\r\nfigure, which they called “Le vieux bout de l’an,” and after parading\r\nit through the streets by torch-light with the mock ceremonial of a\r\nfuneral procession, to end by burying it on the beach, or in some other\r\nretired spot, or to make a bonfire and burn it.[13]\r\n\r\n“How often has it been my melancholy duty to attend, sometimes as chief\r\nmourner (or mummer), the funeral of old _Bout de l’An_! A log of wood,\r\nwrapt up in sable cloth, was his usual representative, when, with great\r\nand even classical solemnity, just as the clock struck twelve, the\r\njuvenile procession set itself in motion, every member thereof carrying\r\na lantern scooped out of a turnip, or made of oiled paper.… Ere the\r\nlaw-suit between old and new style was for ever settled, the annual\r\nlog--Andrew Bonamy is mine authority--underwent the Pagan ceremony of\r\nincineration at the Gallet-Heaume.”--(Mr. Métivier in the _Star_, March\r\n14th, 1831.)\r\n\r\nThis is probably one of the superstitious practices against which the\r\nordinance of the Royal Court in 1622 was directed. At the same time,\r\nchildren were wont to go about from house to house to beg for a New\r\nYear’s gift, under the name of “hirvières” or “oguinane.” In so doing\r\nthey chanted the following rude rhyme:--\r\n\r\n    Oguinâni! Oguinâno!\r\n    Ouvre ta pouque, et pis la recllios.[14]\r\n\r\nIn Scotland _Hogmanay_ is the universal popular name for the last day\r\nof the year. “It is a day of high festival among young and old--but\r\nparticularly the young.… It is still customary, in retired and\r\nprimitive towns, for the children of the poorer class of people to get\r\nthemselves on that morning swaddled in a great sheet, doubled up in\r\nfront, so as to form a vast pocket, and then to go along the streets\r\nin little bands, calling at the doors of the wealthier classes for an\r\nexpected dole of wheaten bread. This is called their Hogmanay.”[15]\r\n\r\nThe first day of the year is with all classes in Guernsey the one\r\nmost strictly observed as a holiday, and, in all but the religious\r\nobservance, is more thought of than even Christmas Day. Presents\r\nare given to friends, servants and children; the heads of families\r\ngather around them those who have left the paternal roof; more distant\r\nrelatives exchange visits; young people call at the houses of their\r\naged kinsfolk to wish them many happy returns of the season, and,\r\nin many cases, to receive the gifts that are awaiting them; and\r\nreceptions--now become almost official in their character--are held by\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor, the Bailiff, and the Dean. Cake and wine are\r\noffered to visitors, and the day ends in most households with a feast\r\nin proportion with their means and rank in society. All the morning\r\nthe roads and streets are crowded with groups of persons hurrying from\r\nhouse to house, hands are warmly shaken, kind words are spoken, many\r\na little coolness or misunderstanding is forgotten, and even breaches\r\nof long standing are healed, when neighbours join in eating the many\r\ncakes for which Guernsey is famous, and which are considered suitable\r\nfor the occasion. The favourite undoubtedly is “gâche à corinthes,”\r\nanglicé “currant cake,” also a kind of soft bread-cake, known by the\r\nname of “galette;” and on Christmas Day a sort of milk-cake, called\r\n“gâche détrempée” is baked early in the morning, so as to appear hot\r\nat the breakfast table; and so completely is this repast looked upon\r\nin the light of a family feast, that parents living in the country\r\nsend presents of these cakes to their children who have taken service\r\nin town. A younger brother will leave the paternal roof long before\r\ndaybreak to carry to his sister, at her master’s house, the cake which\r\nthe affectionate mother has risen in the middle of the night to bake\r\nfor her absent child.\r\n\r\n[10] EDITOR’S NOTE.--In _Contes Populaires, Préjugés, Patois,\r\nProverbes, etc., de l’arrondissement de Bayeux_, par M. Pluquet;\r\nseconde édition, 1834, it is said: “During the eight days before\r\nChristmas (Les Avents de Noël) apparitions are most frequent, and\r\nsorcerers have most power.”\r\n\r\n[11] EDITOR’S NOTE.--This belief also prevails in Normandy, for M.\r\nDu Bois says:--“Les paysans sont persuadés que, la veille de Noël,\r\nà l’heure du sacrement de la messe de minuit, tous les bestiaux, et\r\nsurtout les bœufs et les vaches, mettent un genou en terre pour rendre\r\nhommage à Jésus naissant. Il serait imprudent, disent-ils, de chercher\r\nà s’assurer de ce fait par soi-même; on courrait le risque d’être\r\nbattu.”--_Recherches sur la Normandie_, Du Bois, 1843, p. 343. And in\r\nthe centre of France and Berry:--“On assure qu’au moment où le prêtre\r\nélève l’hostie, pendant la messe de minuit, tous les animaux de la\r\nparoisse s’agenouillent et prient devant leurs crèches.”--_Croyances et\r\nLégendes du Centre de la France_, par Laisnel de la Salle, Tome 1er, p.\r\n17.\r\n\r\n[12] EDITOR’S NOTE.--In Sark the superstition is that the water in the\r\nstreams and wells turns into blood at midnight on Christmas Eve, and\r\nthey also tell you that if you go and look you die within the year. One\r\nSark man said that he was determined to go to the well and draw water\r\nat midnight, come what might. So on Christmas Eve he sallied forth to\r\nreach the well in his back yard; as he crossed the threshold he tripped\r\nand hit his head against the lintel of the door, and was picked up\r\nunconscious the next morning. Most people would have taken this as a\r\nwarning and desisted, but he was obstinate, and the following Christmas\r\nEve he left the house at midnight as before, but as he approached the\r\nwell he heard a voice saying:--\r\n\r\n    “Qui veut voir\r\n    Veut sa mort.”\r\n\r\nThen at last he was frightened, and rushed back into the house, and\r\nnever again did he attempt to pry into forbidden mysteries.--From Mrs.\r\nLe Messurier, of Sark.\r\n\r\n[13] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Hence the country people’s term for the effigy of\r\nGuy Fawkes on the 5th of November “le vieux bout de l’an.”\r\n\r\n[14]\r\n\r\n    “Oguinâni! Oguinâno!\r\n    Ope thy purse, and shut it then.”\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to the derivation of “oguinâne,”\r\nfrom which the Scottish “hogmanay” also comes. Mr. Métivier, in his\r\ndictionary, says that it means the annual present of a master to his\r\nservants, of a seigneur to his vassals, of a father to his children,\r\nand derives it from “_agenhine feoh_” or “_hogenehyne fee_” the present\r\nmade, or money given, to those who belong to you--a word composed of\r\n“agen” one’s own--as the English _own_, and “hind” servant, one of the\r\nfamily. And he laughs at the theory propounded by various French and\r\nEnglish folklorists that it is derived from the rites of the Druids,\r\nand comes from their ancient cry “Au guy l’an neuf”--“the mistletoe\r\n(gui) of the New Year”--New Year’s Day being the day the pagans went\r\ninto the forests to seek the mistletoe on the oaks. (See _Notes and\r\nQueries_. Series III. Vol. IV. p. 486.) In the _Star_ of March 14th,\r\n1831, Mr. Métivier tells us that “as late as the reign of Louis XIV.\r\nit was usual for the populace round Morlaix to chant a variety of\r\nbacchanalian songs on the last eve of the year, and the chorus or\r\n_refrain_ of every stanza was precisely what I should never have\r\nfancied it to be--our\r\n\r\n    ‘Oghin an eit! Oghin an eit!’\r\n\r\nI am informed by a worthy monk that the good news announced by these\r\nmystical words had nothing to do with the religion of Christ, and that,\r\nbeing interpreted, they only tell us that ‘the wheat is upspringing--le\r\nbled germe.’ _Eit_ and _od_ originally implied not wheat only, but\r\nevery sort of grain and seed. Thus it appears that what at first sight\r\ndefied all rational conjecture--the ‘oguinâni, oguinâno,’ cry of\r\nour small gentry, once formed the immemorial chorus of an Armorican\r\nhymn--the pure heathen liturgical relic of some Gaulish festival.\r\nThe primitive ditty was full of allusions to the increase of light,\r\nthe revival of vegetable nature, and other seasonable topics. The\r\nnoisy little heralds of this pleasing intelligence received for their\r\nreward an ‘oguinâne,’ or, as it is now called, ‘leurs hirvières’--an\r\n_hibernum donum_ or _winter_ gift. It is true that a few half-learned\r\nlexicographers talk of the mistletoe and ‘Au Guy l’An Neuf;’ but the\r\nFrench savans were systematic haters of France’s aboriginal languages,\r\nand the minor Latin poet who invented this nonsensical interpretation\r\nof a word whose etymon he was too lazy to dig for in its native mine\r\nhas hardly been dead two centuries.”\r\n\r\n[15] EDITOR’S NOTE.--The old people of St. Martin’s parish still (1896)\r\ntalk of having in their youth gone to the neighbours’ houses on New\r\nYear’s Eve singing the following rhyme:--\r\n\r\n    _“Bon jour, Monsieur! Bon jour, Madame!_\r\n    _Je n’vous ai pas vu acouâre ~(encore)~ chut ~(cette)~ an._\r\n    _Et je vous souhaite une bouâne année,_\r\n    _Et mes irvières s’i’vous plliet.”_\r\n\r\nAnd a little bowl or bag of pennies was always at hand for gratuities.\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Grand’ Querrue.\r\n\r\n    “And at the farm on the lochside of Rannock, in parlour and kitchen,\r\n    Hark! there is music--yea, flowing of music, of milk, and of whiskey;\r\n    Dancing and drinking, the young and the old, the spectators and actors,\r\n    Never not actors the young, and the old not always spectators:\r\n    Lo, I see piping and dancing!”\r\n\r\n                     --_“The Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich,” by A. H. Clough._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: La Grand’ Querrue.]\r\n\r\nThe parsnip seems to have been cultivated at a very early period in\r\nGuernsey, the soil appearing to be particularly well suited to the\r\ngrowth of this valuable root. We have proof that tithe of them was\r\npaid in times long anterior to the Reformation, although not claimed\r\nin the present day. In order to secure a good crop, it is necessary\r\nthat the ground should be deeply trenched, and this operation, which\r\ntakes place at the beginning of the year, and entails a great amount\r\nof labour, is, nevertheless, looked forward to with pleasure, as it\r\ngives rise to social meetings. The trenching of the soil was formerly,\r\nand is still occasionally, effected by the spade alone. This was done\r\nby farm labourers and hired men with a peculiar spade called “Une\r\nbêque de Guernesi.” Made by the country blacksmiths of the island, the\r\nhandle was of wood, generally ash, and so was the upper portion of the\r\nblade, which was heart-shaped, the tip of the blade being of steel.\r\nIt was a very slow operation, four perches a day being the utmost one\r\nman could accomplish, so that it had to begin very early in the year,\r\n“whilst eating the bread baked at Christmas,” as the old farmers said.\r\nBut about a hundred years ago the “grand’ querrue” or big plough was\r\nintroduced at Les Fontaines, in the Castel parish, the house of the\r\nLenfesteys. This is preceded by one of the ordinary size to trace the\r\nfurrow. The large plough, being an expensive instrument and one that\r\nis only wanted occasionally, is often the joint property of several\r\nneighbours, who unite together to assist each other in working it.\r\nEach brings his quota of labourers, and as many as twenty-two animals\r\nhave been sometimes seen harnessed to the same plough, to wit, six\r\nbullocks and sixteen horses. Every man who is fortunate enough to be\r\nthe possessor of a beast deems himself bound in honour to produce it\r\non these occasions. The plough is generally guided by the owner of the\r\nfield, and a furrow is made about twelve inches deep by about eighteen\r\nto twenty-four inches wide. As the labour is social, all work with good\r\nwill and emulation, and the scene is one of great animation. Of course\r\nthe assistance given is gratuitous, or, to speak more correctly, is\r\nto be returned in kind when required. The farmer, however, who avails\r\nhimself of the labour of his neighbours, is expected to feed them.\r\nThe consequence is that the “grand’ querrue” is made the occasion of\r\na rural feast. The cider, for which the island is famous, circulates\r\nfreely throughout the day, and the prettiest girls are selected as\r\ncup-bearers. Work begins about seven o’clock in the morning; about ten\r\no’clock a sort of luncheon called “mi-matin” is provided; this consists\r\nof bread and butter, with cheese, fried cod fish, and strong tea or\r\ncoffee. At noon the cattle are unharnessed and put to feed, and then\r\ncomes the dinner of cabbage-soup, a large boiled ham or “pâlette,”\r\na breast-piece of pork, and perhaps a round of beef. At two o’clock\r\nwork is resumed, with a stoppage at four for a “mi-relevée” of tea and\r\ncurrant cake, and occasional intervals for “une petite goutte;” for it\r\nis well known that “i’faut prendre une petite goutte pour arrousaï,\r\nou bien j’n’airons pâs d’pânais,”--“one must take a sip to moisten the\r\nfield, or there will be no parsnips.” The day closes with a substantial\r\nsupper, more beef, more ham, enormous plum-puddings, baked, not boiled,\r\nin the old ovens, (“grosses houichepotes”) with plenty of cider.\r\n\r\nTo this feast it is customary to invite the members of the respective\r\nfamilies who have not taken part in the labours of the day, and the\r\nricher farmers send presents of pudding to their poorer neighbours who\r\nare not invited to share in the work. Friends and relations who reside\r\nat a distance, or in town, also join the gathering, and the best part\r\nof the night is spent in singing, dancing, story-telling, blind man’s\r\nbuff, or the ancient roundelay of “mon beau laurier.”[16]\r\n\r\n[16] EDITOR’S NOTE.--One curious custom at the supper or “défrique” was\r\nthat the men had their meal first, and not till they had finished did\r\nthe women sit down to have theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\nShrove Tuesday.\r\n\r\nShrove Tuesday is observed in the usual way, by a general frying\r\nand eating of pancakes, and the custom must be old, and one of the\r\nsuperstitious practices which the zeal of the Presbyterian clergy\r\nfailed in eradicating; for, had it been re-introduced from England, it\r\nis not likely that it would have become so universal, or have taken so\r\nstrong a hold on the minds of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Sunday in Lent.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbouring island of Alderney, the first Sunday in Lent is\r\nknown as “Le Dimanche des Brandons”--a name by which it is designated\r\nin old calendars, and which it still bears in some parts of France.[17]\r\nAccording to the late Mr. John Ozanne (de la Salerie), a native of\r\nAlderney, it was also known as “le jour des vitres,” this last word\r\nhaving, as he said, in the dialect of Alderney, the meaning of _masks_.\r\nThis gives rise to the supposition that in days gone by masking formed\r\npart of the entertainment. On this day the young people made bonfires\r\nand danced round them, especially at “La Pointe de Clanque.” This dance\r\nwas supposed to have had a bacchanalian origin, but was practised up\r\nto fifty years ago; they revolved round these bonfires, and leapt\r\nover them, and then, lighting wisps of straw, returned to the town by\r\nthe fields, throwing about these torches, to the great danger of the\r\nthatched roofs.\r\n\r\n[17] EDITOR’S NOTES.--That these customs were also kept up in Guernsey\r\nis evident from the following extract from the manuscript note book of\r\nMonsieur Elie Brevint, who died in the island of Sark in 1674, aged\r\n87. He says:--“Le premier Dimanche de Caresme s’appelle le jour des\r\nBrandons; à St. Martin de Guernezé les jeunes hommes par esbat portent\r\nau soir du dit jour brandons de glie, etc.”\r\n\r\nIn _Les Archives de Normandie_, 1824, p. 164, there is the following\r\nnotice of “Le Jour des Brandons,” which shows that this custom also\r\nprevailed in various parts of France. “À Saint Vaast et à Reville,\r\nla veille de l’Epiphanie, des centaines d’enfants et même d’hommes,\r\nparcourrent les campagnes munis de brandons allumés. Ils crient,\r\n‘Taupes et mulots, sortez de mon clos, ou je vous mets le feu sur le\r\ndos.’ Ou dans quelques autres parties de la Normandie on chante ces\r\nvers-ci:\r\n\r\n    Bon jour les rois\r\n    Jusqu’a douze mois\r\n    Douz’ mois passés\r\n    Rois, revenez!\r\n    Charge, pommier!\r\n    A chaq’ petite branchette\r\n    Tout plein ma grand’ pochette,\r\n    Taupes, mulots,\r\n    Sortez du clos,\r\n    Ou j’ vous brul’rai la barbe et l’s os!\r\n\r\nLe lendemain au soir on allume un nouveau feu qu’on appèle une\r\nBourgulée, et l’on renouvelle le même chant, qui commence encore par\r\n‘Adieu les Rois,’ etc. Dans la Commune de Créance, une grande partie de\r\nla population passe presque toute la nuit du premier Dimanche de Carême\r\nà faire la même sommation aux taupes et aux mulots.… Le Dimanche des\r\nBrandons est une date commune et naturelle des actes du moyen age.”\r\n\r\nThe “Dimanche des Brandons” was also kept up in the centre of France\r\nwith very much the same ceremonies. See _Croyances et Légendes du\r\ncentre de la France_, Laisnel de la Salle. Tome 1er. Page 35.\r\n\r\n“At Dijon, in Burgundy, it is the custom upon the first Sunday in Lent\r\nto make large fires in the streets, whence it is called “Firebrand\r\nSunday.” This practice originated in the processions formerly made\r\non that day by the peasants with lighted torches of straw, to drive\r\naway, as they called it, the bad air from the earth.”--From _Nori\r\nBourguinons_, p. 148. Quoted in Brand’s _Observations on Popular\r\nAntiquities_, p. 57.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood Friday.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Good Friday it is the custom of the young people who\r\nlive near the sea shore to make parties to go down to the beach to\r\ncollect limpets. When a sufficient quantity of these shell fish has\r\nbeen taken, a flat stone or rock of sufficient size is selected, and,\r\nafter being carefully swept and divested of all extraneous matter, the\r\nlimpets are arranged on it with their shells uppermost. A head of dry\r\nfurze or other brushwood is then placed over them and set on fire,\r\nand the limpets are left covered with the hot embers until they are\r\nsupposed to be sufficiently cooked. Bread-cakes, fresh baked--if hot\r\nfrom the oven so much the better--with an ample supply of the rich\r\nbutter for which the island is so famous, and a few bottles of cider\r\nor beer, have been provided beforehand by the members composing the\r\npic-nic, and the limpets, now done to a turn, are eaten as a relish to\r\nthe simple meal, with a better appetite, and more real pleasure than\r\nprobably a far more elaborate feast would afford.[18]\r\n\r\nHot cross buns on Good Friday were unknown in Guernsey at the\r\ncommencement of the present century.\r\n\r\n[18] EDITOR’S NOTE.--“In Sark, on Good Friday it is the custom for boys\r\nto go and sail small boats on the ponds or pools by the sea-shore; and\r\nthese boats are made a good while beforehand, or treasured up of long\r\nstanding; this custom they never fail to keep up. Numbers of these same\r\nboys also go in the afternoon to the Eperquerie drill-ground, to play\r\na game which they call rounders. It is played with a ball and a stick,\r\nand somewhat resembles cricket.”--From _A Descriptive Sketch of the\r\nIsland of Sark_, by the Rev. J. L. V. Cachemaille (for many years Vicar\r\nof the island), published in Clarke’s _Guernsey Magazine_, October,\r\n1875.\r\n\r\n\r\nEaster.\r\n\r\nThere do not appear to be any particular customs connected with Easter,\r\nbut some old people can still remember that in their youth the children\r\nin some parts of the country used to go about from door to door\r\nbegging for eggs.[19] This was called “demander la mouissole,” and was\r\nevidently derived from the practice, so common in all parts of Europe,\r\nof giving presents of eggs at this season. _Mouissole_ is derived from\r\nthe old Norman word _mouisson_, which means “a bird.”\r\n\r\n[19] EDITOR’S NOTE.--In the country the dinner on Easter Sunday used\r\nalways to consist of fried eggs and bacon. As an old woman said, “it\r\nwas the only day we ever tasted an egg.” If they could not get fowls’\r\neggs, they even got wild birds’ eggs, and fried and ate them!\r\n\r\n“In the North of England boys beg on Easter Eve eggs to play with, and\r\nbeggars ask for them to eat.”--_De Ludis Orientalibus_, by Hyde, 1694.\r\np. 237.\r\n\r\n“The custom of eating a gammon of bacon at Easter, which is kept up\r\nin many parts of England, was founded on this, _viz._, to shew their\r\nabhorrence to Judaism at that solemn commemoration of our Lord’s\r\nResurrection.”--From _Aubrey_, 1679.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First of April.\r\n\r\nThe first of April is not forgotten by children, who amuse themselves\r\non this day by attaching long shreds of paper or bits of rag by means\r\nof crooked pins to the clothes of passers-by,[20] and then crying out\r\nas loud as they can bawl, “La Coûe! La Coûe!” or “La Folle Agnès.” No\r\none knows the reason of the latter exclamation.\r\n\r\n[20] EDITOR’S NOTE.--In _Lancashire Folk-Lore_ p. 225, it says, “On\r\nMid-Lent or ‘Bragot’ Sunday it is a custom for boys to hook a piece of\r\ncoloured cloth to the women’s gowns, and a similar custom prevails in\r\nPortugal at carnival times.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSundays in May.\r\n\r\nOn the first Sunday in May the young men and women of the lower orders\r\narise at daybreak and sally forth into the country in groups, returning\r\nhome with large nosegays generally pilfered from the open gardens that\r\nadorn the neat cottages of the peasantry.[21]\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that this custom was introduced from\r\nEngland, but in Alderney it appears to have been a very ancient\r\npractice to keep the first of May as a holiday. Garlands of flowers\r\nwere suspended across the street, under which the young people danced,\r\nand the day was generally wound-up by a sort of pic-nic supper\r\nor tea-drinking, to which each family contributed its quota. The\r\nintroduction of late years of a large stranger population into that\r\nisland, in consequence of the extensive fortifications and harbour\r\nworks undertaken by Government, has completely changed the primitive\r\ncharacter of the place, and has put an end to this picturesque custom.\r\n\r\n[21] EDITOR’S NOTE.--“Bourne (‘_Antiquit. Vulg._’ chap, xxv.) tells us\r\nthat in his time, in the villages in the North of England, the juvenile\r\npart of both sexes were wont to rise a little after midnight on the\r\nfirst of May, and walk to some neighbouring wood, accompanied with\r\nmusic and the blowing of horns, where they broke down branches from the\r\ntrees and adorned them with nosegays and crowns of flowers. This done,\r\nthey returned homewards with their booty about the time of sunrise, and\r\nmade their doors and windows triumph in the flowery spoil.” (Quoted in\r\n_Brand’s Popular Antiquities_, p. 121).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhitsuntide.\r\n\r\n    “And let us do it with no show of fear;\r\n    No, with no more than if we heard that England\r\n    Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance.”\r\n\r\n                                     --_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\nWhit Monday, Midsummer Day, and the day on which Her Majesty’s birth is\r\ncelebrated, are all kept as holidays, and have long been appropriated\r\nto the mustering and exercising of the Militia.\r\n\r\nThis institution differs in many respects from what goes by the same\r\nname in England, and is more in the nature of the “Garde Nationale” of\r\nFrance. It is of great antiquity, for we find among the Patent Rolls\r\nof Edward III., one dated May, 1337, appointing Thomas de Ferrers\r\nGovernor of the Islands, and giving him directions to enrol all the\r\nable-bodied inhabitants, to supply them with fitting arms, and to\r\nplace proper officers over them, in order that they might be able to\r\nresist the invasions of the allies of the Scotch, with whom England\r\nwas then at war, and who had recently made some descents on Sark, and\r\non the coasts of the larger islands. The service is gratuitous and\r\ncompulsory, for, by the common law, all male inhabitants, from the ages\r\nof sixteen to sixty, are liable to be called out, unless prevented\r\nby illness, or able to claim exemption on some other legal ground.\r\nNevertheless, with the generality of the people, especially with those\r\nof the rural parishes, the service is decidedly popular. An afternoon\r\nof ball-practice, or a general review by the Lieutenant-Governor, is\r\nlooked forward to with pleasure, and the latter occasion is one which\r\naffords a treat to all classes of the community. At an early hour the\r\nroads are crowded with merry groups, dressed in their best, hastening\r\nto the spot where the review is to take place. The country damsels are\r\nproud of seeing their lovers set off by their military attire, and when\r\nthe men are dismissed it is amusing to see the careful wife or the\r\nattentive sweetheart produce from the depth of her pocket, or from a\r\nhand-basket, a light cap, or wide-awake, to replace the heavy shako,\r\nwhile the young sons and brothers, not yet old enough to be enrolled,\r\ndispute who shall have the honour of bearing the weighty musket. The\r\nreview is generally over by noon, and those who are industrious may\r\nreturn to their work. Most of the men, however, particularly the\r\nunmarried ones, prefer making a thorough holiday of it, and for the\r\nrest of the afternoon the streets of the town are filled with groups of\r\nmerry-makers; the public houses ply a brisk trade, and the evening is\r\noften far advanced before the joyous groups think of returning to their\r\nown homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMidsummer.\r\n\r\n    “At eve last Midsummer no sleep I sought.”\r\n\r\n                          --_Gay’s Pastorals._\r\n\r\nThe custom of making bonfires on the hilltops at Midsummer was formerly\r\nso general among all the Celtic nations that it is highly probable that\r\nit must have existed also in these islands, the aboriginal inhabitants\r\nof which belonged undoubtedly to the Celtic race. In Scotland and in\r\nIreland these fires are called Beltein, or Baltein; they are lighted\r\nalso on May Day, and are supposed to be a relic of the worship formerly\r\npaid to the sun, under the name of Bel, or Baal. Throughout Brittany,\r\nand in some of the neighbouring parts of Normandy, “les feux de la St.\r\nJean” are still lighted on all the hills. In some parts of Wales and\r\nCornwall the custom is still kept up. That some observances connected\r\nwith this season still existed in this island in the early part of\r\nthe 17th Century is certain, from the fact of the Royal Court having\r\npromulgated an ordinance in 1622 prohibiting begging on St. John’s Eve,\r\n“as tending to keep alive superstition,” but what these observances\r\nwere, is now entirely forgotten. It has been asserted that in days gone\r\nby “la Rocque Balan,” a remarkable and picturesque mass of granite on\r\nthe plain of L’Ancresse, used to be resorted to at Midsummer, and that\r\nthe youths and maidens danced together on its summit, where bonfires\r\nused to be lit. The burden of an old song--\r\n\r\n    “J’irons tous à la Saint Jean\r\n    Dansaïr sus la Rocque Balan,”\r\n\r\nis quoted as confirmatory of this assertion. Some suppose that “Balan”\r\nhas the same derivation as “Beltein;” others say that there was once\r\na logan, or rocking stone, “une pierre qui balançait,” on the apex of\r\nthe rock; but there is also a tradition that the former Priors of St.\r\nMichel du Valle caused the merchandise of their tenants and vassals\r\nto be weighed, and that the rock derived its appellation from the\r\n“balances” used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe most probable and matter of fact solution of the difficulty is\r\nthat, like many other localities, it took its designation from the\r\nperson to whom it once belonged, the name “Balan” being that of a\r\nfamily, now extinct, which at one time inhabited this parish.\r\n\r\nEvery cottage and farmhouse in the island is furnished with what is\r\ncalled a “lit de fouâille” or “jonquière”--now called the “green\r\nbed”--a sort of rustic divan generally placed in a recess between\r\nthe hearth and a window. This, raised about eighteen inches from the\r\nground, is thickly strewn with dried fern, or pea-haulm, and forms the\r\nusual seat of the females of the family, when engaged in knitting or\r\nsewing, and a very comfortable couch on which the men can repose after\r\nthe labours of the day. But at Midsummer, after the fresh fern has\r\nbeen cut, the taverns and cottages vie with each other in decorating\r\nthese seats. A canopy is raised over them, and the whole, floor and\r\nall, is thickly carpeted with fresh cut fern, and ornamented with the\r\nmost brilliant and showy flowers that can be procured, not scattered\r\nat hap-hazard, but arranged in formal, and often far from inelegant\r\npatterns.[22] The love of flowers is almost a passion with every class\r\nof the inhabitants, and displays itself in the variety to be found at\r\nall seasons in every garden, and the taste with which they are employed\r\nin decorations.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say what gave rise to this custom of adorning the\r\n“jonquière,” but it is doubtless one of great antiquity.[23] Old people\r\nsay that in former days it was customary to elect a girl from among the\r\ninhabitants of the district, and seat her in state beneath the floral\r\ncanopy, where under the name[24] of “La Môme” she received in silence\r\nthe homage of the assembled guests.[25] Perhaps the whole is a remnant\r\nof the old May games transferred to this season--perhaps it is an\r\nobservance connected with the ceremonies with which in many countries,\r\nand especially among the Celtic nations, the sun was greeted on his\r\narrival at the summer solstice, and in which branches of trees and\r\nbunches of flowers were used to decorate the houses.\r\n\r\n[22] EDITOR’S NOTE.--An old country woman described to me a “Lit\r\nde Fouaille” she had seen as a child. She described it as being a\r\nfour-post bed, both mattress and ceiling being one mass of flowers most\r\ningeniously twined together. Each post was garlanded with flowers, and\r\nflower curtains hung from the top, woven together, she could not tell\r\nhow. In the middle sat the girl--silent.\r\n\r\n[23] See _Folk-Lore Journal_, Vol. I, Pp. 297 and 301.\r\n\r\n[24] Mr. Métivier writes under the heading of “Lit de Fouaille.”--“Que\r\nde gens instruits, peu versés dans l’étude de notre Calendrier\r\nChampêtre, se sont imaginés que le lit de feuilles et de fleurs du\r\nsolstice d’été--fête aussi ancienne que l’homme lui-même, n’était\r\nqu’un lit vert--une jonquière! L’apothéose de la beauté sur un trone\r\nde roses et de lys se retrouvait autrefois dans tous les climats, où\r\nle soleil favorisait la culture de ces trésors de Flore. Presque de\r\nnos jours, chaque canton de l’île élisait une tante ou cousine. Vouée\r\nau silence--‘La Môme;’ et cette bonne parente recevait de toute la\r\ncompagnie l’hommage d’un baiser--c’est une allusion au silence de\r\nl’astre du jour et à la naissance d’Harpocrate, le doigt sur la bouche,\r\nau milieu d’un carreau de vives fleurs.”\r\n\r\n[25] EDITOR’S NOTES. By the courtesy of Mr. J. Linwood Pitts I am able\r\nto insert the following note, showing the gradual decadence of the old\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\n“Some sixty or seventy years ago, a Mr. and Mrs. Le Maître kept\r\na public-house at Le Cognon, near St. Sampson’s. At the summer\r\nvraicking time, they used to deck the green bed with elaborate floral\r\ndecorations--a veritable “Lleit de feuilles.” A plate was placed in the\r\ncentre of the bed to receive contributions. The young people used to go\r\nthere and dance in the evenings after vraicking, Mr. Le Maître playing\r\nthe fiddle for the dancers. Mrs. Robin (now seventy-three years old)\r\ndanced there as a girl.”\r\n\r\nStow in his “Survey” tells us “that on the vigil of St. John Baptist\r\nevery man’s door being shadowed with green birch, long fennel, St.\r\nJohn’s wort, orpin, white lilies, and such like, garnished upon with\r\ngarlands of beautiful flowers, had also lamps of glass.…”\r\n\r\nIn Brand’s _Popular Antiquities of Great Britain_, Vol. I. p. 190, it\r\nis said:--“Hutchinson mentions another custom used on this day; it\r\nis to dress out stools with a cushion of flowers. A layer of clay is\r\nplaced on the stool, and therein is stuck with great regularity, an\r\narrangement of all kinds of flowers, so close as to form a beautiful\r\ncushion. These are exhibited at the doors of houses in the villages,\r\nand at the ends of streets and cross lanes of larger towns, where the\r\nattendants beg money from passengers to enable them to have an evening\r\nfeast and dancing.” He adds “This custom is evidently derived from\r\nthe Ludi Compitalii of the Romans; this appellation is taken from the\r\nCompita or Cross Lanes, where they were instituted and celebrated\r\nby the multitude assembled before the building of Rome. It was the\r\nFeast of Lares, or Household Gods, who presided as well over houses\r\nas streets. This mode of adorning the seat or couch of the Lares was\r\nbeautiful, and the idea of reposing them on aromatic flowers, and beds\r\nof roses, was excellent.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMidsummer Day in Sark.\r\n\r\nIn Sark, Midsummer Day is the great holiday of the year, when every\r\nyouth who is fortunate enough to be the possessor of a horse, or who\r\ncan borrow one for the occasion, makes use of it. Bedecking both\r\nhimself and his steed with bunches of flowers, he goes to seek his\r\nfavourite damsel, who generally sports a new bonnet in honour of the\r\nfestival, and they often ride about in couples on the horses’ backs.\r\nThey then amuse themselves in racing up and down the roads, and even\r\nventure sometimes to cross at a gallop the dangerous pass of the\r\nCoupée--a narrow ledge of rock with a precipice on either side,--which\r\nconnects the peninsula of Little Sark with the main island. In the\r\nevening they assemble to drink tea, eat currant cake, and dance. This\r\ncustom is known by the name of “Les Chevauchées.”[26]\r\n\r\n[26] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Many charms and spells were also resorted to on\r\nthe eve and on the day of “La Saint Jean,” which will be inserted\r\nunder their proper heading. Another habit of the young men and girls\r\non Midsummer Day was to go out to the Grand Pont at St. Sampson’s, and\r\nthere have a supper composed of fried ham and eggs and pancakes, and\r\ncraûbackaûs or crayfish, the latter placed on the table in the pan, and\r\neveryone helping themselves with their own fork. The custom was for the\r\ngirls to be dressed entirely in white, while the men wore white duck\r\nor jean trousers, swallow-tailed coats, fancy waistcoats, and shoes\r\nadorned with large white bows. The proceedings finished with songs and\r\ndances.\r\n\r\n\r\nMidsummer Day in Jersey.\r\n\r\nIn Jersey, the fishermen who inhabit the parish of St. John have a\r\ncustom of circumnavigating at Midsummer a certain rock, called “Le\r\nCheval Guillaume,” that lies off their coast, and in the same parish,\r\nas well as in some other parts of the island, a very singular practice\r\nhas long prevailed. It is thus described in Plees’ Account of the\r\nIsland of Jersey. “At Midsummer Eve, a number of persons meet together,\r\nand procure a large brass boiler; this is partly filled with water, and\r\nsometimes metallic utensils of different kinds are thrown in. The rim\r\nis then encircled with a strong species of rush, to which strings of\r\nthe same substance are attached. When these strings are sufficiently\r\nmoistened, the persons assembled take hold of them, and, drawing them\r\nquickly through their hands, a tremendous vibration is excited in the\r\nboiler, and a most barbarous, uncouth, and melancholy sound produced.\r\nTo render this grating concert still more dissonant, others blow with\r\ncows’ horns and conches. This singular species of amusement continues\r\nfor several hours: it is termed ‘faire braire les poëles.’” The same\r\ncustom prevailed in Normandy, from whence it doubtless made its way\r\ninto Jersey. In the former province it is now on the decline. Being\r\nobserved on St. John’s Eve, it would appear to have a reference to\r\nsome Christian festival in honour of that saint; or it may relate\r\nto Midsummer Day. Large numbers of the middling and lower classes\r\nin Jersey are in the habit of coming to Guernsey for the Midsummer\r\nholidays, and the natives of the latter island often choose this season\r\nfor visiting their friends and relations in Jersey. In the _Athenæum_,\r\nSeptember 20th, 1890, it says: “It may not be generally known that in\r\nthe island of Jersey on St. John’s Eve the older inhabitants used to\r\nlight fires under large iron pots full of water, in which they placed\r\nsilver articles--as spoons, mugs, etc.,--and then knocked the silver\r\nagainst the iron, with the idea of scaring away all evil spirits.\r\nThere are now railroads in Jersey, and these old-world practices have\r\nprobably disappeared.”\r\n\r\nThe day after Midsummer used always to be the day of the fair, held in\r\nthe Fair-field at the Câtel. It was crowded from the early morning by\r\nthe entire population of the island, and the hedges round the field,\r\nand even the sides of the roads in the vicinity, were filled with\r\nFrench women, selling strawberries, and eggs dyed red with cochineal,\r\nand who drove a roaring trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nOn the Sundays in August it was customary, a few years ago, for large\r\ncrowds from all parts of the island to assemble in the afternoon on\r\nthe causeway at St. Sampson’s called “Le Grand Pont.” The favourite\r\nmode of proceeding thither was on horseback, but the only object that\r\nthe visitors seemed to have in view was that of seeing and being seen.\r\nIt is difficult to ascertain exactly what gave rise to this custom,\r\nor indeed whether it is of ancient date. It is certain, however, that\r\nthe improvement of the roads at the commencement of the present\r\ncentury, and the works carried on at the same time for the recovery of\r\na large portion of land from the sea, in this neighbourhood, concurred\r\nin attracting a considerable number of persons to the spot. If the\r\ncustom existed previously it must have been one of old standing, and\r\nmay perhaps be traced to a church wake or feast held in honour of St.\r\nSampson, who is said to have been among the first who preached the\r\ngospel in the island, and whose name the neighbouring church bears. The\r\ncalendar commemorates this saint on the 28th of July, and the practice\r\nof meeting together on the Sunday following the anniversary of a saint,\r\nin the vicinity of the church or chapel dedicated to him, is universal\r\nthroughout Brittany, where these assemblies are known by the name of\r\n“pardons.” In some parts of Normandy, too, the custom is observed, and\r\nthe meetings are known as “Assemblées.” If not held on, or near, the\r\nactual anniversary of the saint, they are often fixed for some Sunday\r\nin August, when, the harvest being over, the peasants have more leisure\r\ntime for amusements.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--“In the southern parts of this nation,” says Bourne,\r\n“most country villages are wont to observe some Sunday in a more\r\nparticular manner than the rest, _i.e._, the Sunday after the day of\r\ndedication, or day of the saint to whom their church was dedicated.”\r\n_Antiq. Vulg._, chap. xxx.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Maison du Neuf Chemin.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nOn the Sundays in September it was the custom, at any rate in the early\r\npart of this century, to ride out to the “Maison du Neuf Chemin,” at\r\nSt. Saviour’s, which was kept by a man called Alexandre. There they\r\nwould eat pancakes, apples and pears, and not come home till dusk. This\r\nis the “Mess Alissandre” to whom Métivier alludes in “La Chanson des\r\nAlexandriens,” “Rimes Guernesiaises,” 1831, p. 52.\r\n\r\n    _“Vouloüs passair dans l’pu bel endret d’l’île_\r\n    _Une a’ r’levaie sans paine et sans chagrin!_\r\n    _Tournai mé l’dos ès sales pavais d’la ville,_\r\n    _Et galoppai sie l’vieil houme du Neuf-Ch’min, etc.”_\r\n\r\n[TRANSLATION].\r\n\r\n    “Do you wish to go to the most beautiful neighbourhood of the island\r\n    One afternoon without difficulty or trouble?\r\n    Turn your back on the dirty pavements of the town,\r\n    And gallop out to the old man of the New Path.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLocal Customs--Civic, Aquatic, Ceremonial.\r\n\r\n    “Ordain them laws, part such as appertain\r\n    To civil justice, part religious rites.”\r\n\r\n                                   --_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Chevanchée de St. Michel.\r\n\r\n    “My parks, my walks, my manors that I had,\r\n    Ev’n now forsake me; and of all my lands\r\n    Is nothing left me.”\r\n\r\n                     --_Shakspeare_, Henry VI.\r\n\r\nBefore giving an account of this curious old custom, now abolished, but\r\nwhich seems to have been instituted originally with a view to keeping\r\nthe highways throughout the island in a due state of repair, it may\r\nbe as well to say something of the feudal system, as it existed, and\r\nindeed, greatly modified of course, still exists in Guernsey. Though,\r\nfrom the loss in the course of many centuries of the original charters,\r\nwe are left in the dark on many points, and can only guess at the\r\norigin of some of the many small manors--or as they are locally termed,\r\n“fiefs”--into which the island is divided.\r\n\r\nIt is known that previous to the Conquest of England by Duke\r\nWilliam,[27] Néel de St. Sauveur, Vicomte of Le Cotentin, was patron\r\nof six of the ten parish churches in Guernsey--those of St. Samson,\r\nSt. Pierre Port, St. Martin de la Bellouse, La Trinité de la Forêt,\r\nNotre Dame de Torteval, and St. André; and it is probable that he was\r\nlord paramount of all the land contained in these parishes. He was\r\none of those barons who conspired against William, and having been\r\ndefeated by him in the Battle of Val des Dunes, all his possessions\r\nwere confiscated. On his submission he was again received into favour,\r\nand his continental possessions restored, but such does not seem to\r\nhave been the case with what he held in Guernsey; for the patronage of\r\nthe churches mentioned above was given by William, a year before the\r\nConquest of England, to the great Abbey of Marmoutier near Tours; and\r\nfrom that time we hear nothing more of the Viscounts of St. Sauveur in\r\nGuernsey.\r\n\r\nThe other four parishes, St. Michel du Valle, Notre Dame du Castel, St.\r\nSauveur, and St. Pierre du Bois, were in the patronage of the Abbey of\r\nMont St. Michel, and the lands in the greater part of these parishes\r\nwere held in nearly equal proportions between that famous Monastery and\r\nthe Earls of Chester--those held by the Abbey being known as “Le Fief\r\nSt. Michel,” and those belonging to the Earl being called “Le Fief le\r\nComte.” A local tradition says that it was Duke Robert, the father of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, who first bestowed these lands on the Abbey,\r\nand on the ancestors of the Earls, but of this there may be some doubt.\r\n\r\nThese lands were held direct from the Sovereign, to whom these lords\r\nwere bound to do homage, but in process of time they came to be\r\nsub-fieffed by their possessors--that is, divided into smaller manors,\r\nwhich, instead of owing direct allegiance to the Crown, depended on\r\ntheir own lords, to whom they had certain services to render, and dues\r\nto pay, and in whose Courts they were bound to make an appearance\r\nthrice in the year. These Courts had jurisdiction in civil matters,\r\nin causes arising between the tenants on their respective fiefs, and\r\nhad their seals, by which all written documents emanating from them\r\nwere authenticated, the seals of the Court of the Priory of St. Michel\r\nrepresenting the Archangel trampling Satan under foot, and that of the\r\nFief le Comte, St. George, near whose ruined chapel the Court still\r\nholds its sittings. As there was always an appeal from the decision of\r\nthese Courts to the supreme tribunal of the island, the Royal Court,\r\nthey gradually ceased to be held, except for the purpose of collecting\r\nthe seignorial dues, and, by an Order of Her Majesty in Council, the\r\nCourt of the Fief St. Michel was abolished, the life interest of the\r\nseneschal, vavassors, prevôts, bordiers, and other officers of the\r\nCourt being preserved.\r\n\r\nOne of the duties of the Court of St. Michel was to see that the\r\nKing’s highway (le chemin du Roi), and certain embankments against\r\nthe encroachments of the sea were kept in proper order and in due\r\nreparation; and in order to insure this they were bound to make an\r\ninspection once in three years.\r\n\r\nWe will now go back and consider the origin of the Fief St. Michel.\r\nAmong the many fiefs in Guernsey, held in chief from the Crown,\r\none of the most ancient and important is certainly that of St.\r\nMichel-du-Valle, extending over the greater part of the northern and\r\nwestern shores of the island. According to a tradition generally\r\naccepted by the historians of the island, and which is in part\r\ncorroborated by documentary evidence, preserved in the “cartulaires”\r\nof the famous Abbey of Mont St. Michel in Normandy, and in the\r\nRecord Office in England, certain monks who had been expelled from\r\nthat monastery for their irregularities, or had left voluntarily in\r\nconsequence of reforms in the community which they disapproved of,\r\ncame over to Guernsey about the year 966 and established themselves in\r\na part of the island called Le Clos du Valle, which at that period,\r\nand until the beginning of the present century, was cut off from the\r\nmainland by an arm of the sea, and could only be reached by a way\r\nacross the sands when the tide had receded. The monks are said to have\r\nbrought the whole of the western part of the island into cultivation,\r\nand to have led such a pious life, and effected such a reform in the\r\nmanners of the inhabitants, that Guernsey acquired the appellation of\r\n“l’île sainte.”[28][29]\r\n\r\nIt is also said that Robert I., Duke of Normandy, father of William the\r\nConqueror, called by some Le Magnifique and by others Le Diable, having\r\nbeen driven by stress of weather to take refuge in Guernsey, when on\r\nhis way to England with a fleet to assist the Saxon Princes Alfred and\r\nEdward in their resistance to the Danish invader Canute, was received\r\nand hospitably entertained by the monks, and in return confirmed them\r\nin the possession of the lands they had been the means of reclaiming,\r\nat the same time constituting the community a priory in dependance on\r\nthe great monastery from which they had originally come; a connexion,\r\nwhich although frequently interrupted during the long wars between\r\nEngland and France for the possession of Normandy, existed until the\r\nsuppression of alien priories in England by Henry V.\r\n\r\nLike all other fiefs the priory had its own Feudal Court, by means of\r\nwhich it collected its rents and dues, and which had jurisdiction in\r\ncivil matters between all its tenants, subject, however, to an appeal\r\nto the higher authority of the Royal Court of the island.\r\n\r\nThe Court of St. Michel-du-Valle consisted of a seneschal and eleven\r\nvavassors, who, in virtue of their office and in consideration of their\r\nservices, held certain lands on the fief. The officers of the Court\r\nwere a greffier or registrar, four prevôts, who had duties analogous to\r\nthose of a sheriff, six bordiers, who had certain services to perform\r\nin collecting dues and attending the meetings of the Court, and, though\r\nlast, not least, an officer styled porte-lance--of whom more hereafter.\r\nThe principal duties of the Court seem to have consisted in legalizing\r\nsales of real property, in which tenants on the fief were interested,\r\nand settling disputes concerning the same arising among them. But there\r\nappear to have been attempts made from time to time to encroach on the\r\nprerogatives of the Royal Court, and various ordinances of the latter\r\nare in existence restraining the seneschal and vavassors from doing\r\ncertain acts, and even fining them for having gone beyond their powers.\r\nThere was one function, however, of the Court of St. Michael which it\r\nseems to have exercised without dispute from time immemorial, but which\r\nit is impossible to account for--the inspection and keeping in order\r\nof the King’s highway throughout the island, and of certain of the\r\nworks for preventing the encroachments of the sea. Possibly it may have\r\noriginated in marking out the bounds of the Fief St. Michel and its\r\ndependencies only, and with this keeping in order the sea defences.[30]\r\nOnce in three years, the seneschal and vavassors of the Court were\r\nbound to perform this duty, which, judging from their later records,\r\nthey appear to have considered rather onerous, as we find several Acts\r\nof the Court dispensing with the ceremony, the reason given being\r\ngenerally the interruption it caused in agricultural labours, and the\r\nloss occasioned thereby, at a time when farmers were far from being in\r\nthe prosperous condition in which they are at present.\r\n\r\nAnother very substantial reason was the expense, which had to be\r\ndefrayed out of the Crown revenue. According to some of our historians,\r\nwho, however, give no evidence in support of their assertion, this\r\ninspection of the roads, commonly known as “La Chevauchée” from the\r\nfact of the principal performers being mounted on horseback, was\r\noriginally annual, and was instituted with a view to having the roads\r\nput in order preparatory to the grand religious procession of the\r\nHost on Corpus Christi Day, but this origin of the ceremony seems\r\nhardly probable, as it is well known that the procession in question\r\nis strictly limited in Roman Catholic countries to parishes, and is\r\nconducted by the parochial clergy. It is difficult to understand how\r\nit came to pass that a subaltern Court, such as was that of the Fief\r\nSt. Michel, came to be allowed to exercise a quasi jurisdiction over\r\nlands which had never been subject to it, but as it was impossible for\r\nthe Court to proceed to every part of their domain without occasionally\r\ntrespassing over other manors, what was originally allowed by courtesy\r\ncame to be looked upon at last as a right. A somewhat similar means\r\nof assuring the keeping in due repair of the high roads existed, and\r\nprobably in a modified form still exists, in the sister island of\r\nJersey, where it is conducted by the vicomte, assisted by two or more\r\njurats of the Royal Court, and the officer, called the “porte-lance,”\r\nwho exercises the same functions as the official bearing the same\r\ndesignation in the “Cour St. Michel.” It is known in Jersey as “La\r\nHarelle.”\r\n\r\nBut it is time to come to a description of how this ancient ceremony\r\nwas conducted in Guernsey. As has been said before, it ought to have\r\ntaken place every third year, at which time the Court of St. Michael\r\nused to meet in the spring to settle preliminaries in fixing the day\r\non which the ceremony was to take place, regulating the costume to be\r\nworn by the “_pions_” or footmen in attendance on the Court, and other\r\nmatters. The month of June was usually chosen, and on the day appointed\r\nthe Court assembled, with all the officers who were to take part in\r\nthe procession, at the small Court House adjoining the remains of the\r\nancient monastic buildings still dignified with the name of “L’Abbaye,”\r\nalthough the establishment had been for centuries no more than a priory\r\ndependent on the famous monastery of Mont St. Michel in Normandy.\r\n\r\nThe following are translations of a few of the Acts and Regulations of\r\nthe Court of St. Michael:--[31]\r\n\r\n31 March, 1768. Seneschal nominated by the Governor.\r\n\r\n24 May, 1768. The Chevauchée being due to take place on the following\r\n8th of June, the Court has ruled the dress of the pions. A black cap\r\n(calotte) with a red ribbon at the back. A ruffled shirt, with black\r\nribbon wristbands, and a black ribbon round the neck. Black breeches\r\nwith red ribbons tied round the knee. White stockings; and red rosettes\r\non their wands. N.B.--This Act does not seem to have been put in force.\r\n\r\n27th April, 1813.--The Chevauchée of His Majesty is appointed to take\r\nplace on Wednesday, the 9th of the following June, for the reparation\r\nof the quays and roads of the King, and it is ordered that it shall\r\nbe published throughout the parishes of this island, and cried in the\r\nMarket Place, so that no one can plead ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe 27th of May, 1813.--Before Thomas Falla, Esq., Seneschal of the\r\nCourt and Jurisdiction of the Fief St. Michel, present, Messieurs James\r\nOzanne, Nicholas Le Patourel, James Falla, Pierre Falla, Jean Mahy,\r\nRichard Ozanne, Nicholas Moullin, Daniel Moullin, and Jean Le Pettevin\r\n(called Le Roux), vavassors of the said Court. The Court being to-day\r\nassembled to regulate the order to be pursued on Wednesday, the 9th of\r\nJune proximo,--the day appointed by the Court for the Chevauchée of His\r\nMajesty to pass--has ordered that all the pions be dressed uniformly\r\nas follows, to wit: Black caps with a red ribbon behind. White shirts,\r\nwith white cravats or neckerchiefs. Circular white waistcoats, with a\r\nred ribbon border. Long white breeches, tied with red ribbon round the\r\nknee. White stockings, and red rosettes on their wands.\r\n\r\nAnd Messieurs les prevôts of the Court are ordered to warn all those\r\nwho are obliged to assist at the said Chevauchée to find themselves\r\nwith their swords, their pions, and their horses, the aforesaid 9th\r\nof June at seven o’clock in the morning at the Court of St. Michael,\r\naccording to ancient custom, in default of appearance to be subject\r\nto such penalties as it shall please the Court to award him. And also\r\nshall Monsieur Le Gouverneur be duly warned, and Thomas Falla, Esq.,\r\nseneschal, and Messrs. Jean Mahy and Nicholas Moullin, vavassors, are\r\nnominated by the Court to form a committee so as to take the necessary\r\nmeasures to regulate the conformity of the said act concerning the\r\ndress of the pions.\r\n\r\n(Signed) JEAN OZANNE, Greffier.\r\n\r\nOn the above day, conformably to the said Act, all the pions, dressed\r\nin the afore-mentioned costume, met at seven o’clock in the morning\r\nat the Court of St. Michael, and there also were found the King’s\r\nofficers, vavassors, who had to serve there as esquires. The King’s\r\nofficers and the seneschal each had two pions on either side of his\r\nbridle rein, the vavassors were only entitled to one.\r\n\r\nThey began with a short inspection and a good breakfast on the\r\nemplacement east of the Yale Church. After breakfast, the members of\r\nthe cortège, with their swords at their sides, got on their horses\r\nopposite the said Court of St. Michael, where the greffier of the\r\nsaid Court said the customary prayer, and the seneschal read the\r\nproclamation, and then they started in the following order:--\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff of the Vale and his pion.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff of the King and his two pions.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff of the Grand Moûtier and his pion.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff of the Petit Moûtier and his pion.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff of Rozel and his pion.\r\n\r\nThe King’s Sergeant and his two pions.\r\n\r\nThe King’s Greffier and his two pions.\r\n\r\nThe King’s Comptroller and his two pions.\r\n\r\nThe King’s Procureur and his two pions.\r\n\r\nThe King’s Receiver and his two pions.\r\n\r\nThe Lance-Bearer and his two pions.\r\n\r\nThe Greffier of the Court St. Michel and his two pions.\r\n\r\nThe Seneschal of the Court St. Michel and his two pions.\r\n\r\nThe eleven vavassors of the Court St. Michel, and one pion each.\r\n\r\nWhilst they are on their march, the five sheriffs carry by turns a\r\nwhite wand in the following order:--\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff of the Vale, from the Vale Church to the end of Grand Pont.\r\n\r\nThe King’s Sheriff, from the end of Grand Pont, as far as the Forest.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff of Grand Moûtier, from the Forest to the King’s Mills.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff of Petit Moûtier, from the King’s Mills to the Douit des\r\nLandes in the Market Place, and the Sheriff of Rozel from the last\r\nmentioned place to the Vale.\r\n\r\nDuring the procession the lance bearer carried a wand of eleven and\r\na quarter feet long, and any obstacle this wand encountered, stones\r\nof walls, branches of trees, etc., had to be cleared away, and the\r\nproprietor of the obstacle was fined thirty sous, which went towards\r\nthe expenses of the dinner. From time immemorial the privilege of the\r\npions,--who were chosen for their good looks--was that of kissing every\r\nwoman they met, whether gentle or simple, their only restriction being\r\nthat only one pion was allowed to kiss the same lady, she had not to\r\nrun the gauntlet of the gang. This privilege of course was invariably\r\nexercised!\r\n\r\nAt the entry of the Braye du Valle the seneschal freed the pions from\r\ntheir attendance on the bridle reins, and gave them authority to\r\nembrace any woman they might encounter, recommending good behaviour and\r\nthe rejoining of their cavaliers at the Hougue-à-la-Perre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parish Church of St. Peter Port.\r\n\r\nShowing houses demolished to make room for present New Market.]\r\n\r\nThe Chevauchée then went to Sohier, les Landes, la rue du Marais, la\r\nGrande Rue, la Mare Sansonnet, les Bordages, la Ronde Cheminée, and\r\nles Morets. Arriving at the Hougue-à-la-Perre the pions regained their\r\nrespective stations on the side of their officers, leading the horses,\r\nand there, at ten o’clock, they were met by His Excellency Sir John\r\nDoyle, the Lieutenant-Governor and his staff, the horses of which were\r\nall decorated with blue ribbons, except those of the said Governor and\r\nof his family, who, out of compliment, carried red ribbons, matching\r\nthose of the Chevauchée. The Bailiff, with his party and John Guille,\r\nEsq., also joined them at this spot, uniformly dressed in blue jackets,\r\nwhite trousers, and leghorn hats.\r\n\r\nThe whole cavalcade then moved on, the Governor and suite at the rear,\r\npreceded by the band of the town regiment, dressed as rustics, in long\r\nwhite jackets and large hats with their brims turned down, and followed\r\nby six dragoons to bring up the rear. Having passed between eleven and\r\ntwelve o’clock through Glatney, Pollet, Carrefour, and High-street,\r\nthey came to the Town Church, where they made the tour around a large\r\nround table which had been placed near the westerly door of the said\r\nchurch, which table was covered with a white cloth and supplied with\r\nbiscuits, cheese, and wine, which had been provided by one of the\r\n“sous-prevôts,” and the Sheriff and the King’s Sergeant, on foot,\r\noffered each cavalier who passed the door food and drink.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval the band played serenades and marches.\r\n\r\nAt noon they proceeded through Berthelot-street to the College\r\nfields, and, passing through the Grange, they reached the Gravée;\r\nhere His Excellency took his leave. The cavalcade passed on by St.\r\nMartin’s road to the ancient manor of Ville-au-Roi, one of the oldest\r\nhabitations in the island. The entrance was tastefully decorated with\r\narches of flowers and a crown in the centre, with flags flying, and,\r\non one of the arches, “Vive la Chevauchée.” Here, according to old\r\nmanorial custom, the party was gratuitously regaled with milk. The\r\nprocession then moved on by Les Câches to Jerbourg, with the exception\r\nof the pions, who proceeded to the village of the Forest, and there\r\nwaited the return of the Court. Here they danced and amused themselves\r\nas before, and being rejoined by the cavalcade at the Bourg they moved\r\non by Les Brulliots, and passing Torteval Church arrived at a house\r\ncalled the Château des Pezeries at Pleinmont, where a marquee was\r\nerected, and cold meats and wine were prepared for the gentlemen. The\r\npions were seated on the grass in a circle which had been hollowed\r\nfor them, in the shape of a round table,[32] and they also had their\r\nrepast. Here the procession halted till four o’clock, and by this\r\ntime were joined by many carriages, filled with ladies and gentlemen,\r\nwho, with a numerous party of all ranks, moved on by Rocquaine, Roque\r\nPoisson, below the Rouvets, Perelle, where a particular stone lies,\r\nwhich they are obliged to go round according to an old custom, from\r\nthere by the Saint Saviour’s Road to the Grands Moulins or King’s\r\nMills. On their arrival there they were rejoined by the pions, the\r\nmill was put in motion, and the miller came out with a plate in each\r\nhand, one containing flour of wheat, and the other of barley, which had\r\nbeen ground that instant by the mill. The miller then placed himself\r\non a large stone, and the procession moved round him; this custom has\r\nprevailed from time immemorial. The procession then continued by St.\r\nGeorge, La Haye du Puits, Saumarez, Le Camp du Roy, Les Salines, to\r\nthe Clos du Valle, to the aforesaid Court of St. Michael, where they\r\narrived about seven o’clock, and where they were again joined by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, the Bailiff, and some of the principal residents.\r\nThe Court having been dismissed they all partook of a sumptuous dinner,\r\nat which Mr. Seneschal Falla presided. The pions were also handsomely\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\nThe last Chevauchée took place in Guernsey on the 31st of May, 1837,\r\nbut the description of the procession we have given refers to the one\r\nin 1825, and is taken from Jacob’s _Annals_, and the _Chronique des\r\nIsles_, by Syvret.\r\n\r\nThe oldest known Act of the Court of St. Michael is the following,\r\ndated the 14th of October, 1204:--\r\n\r\n“Les Chefs Plaids Capitaux de la Saint Michel tenus à Sainte Anne\r\nen la Paroisse du Sarazin,[33] par Nicolle de Beauvoir Bailly, à ce\r\nprésens Jean Le Feyvre, Jean Philippes, Martin de Garris, Jean Maingy,\r\nJean Le Gros, Jemmes le Marchand, Pierre de la Lande, Robert de la\r\nSalle, Colin Henry, Jurez de la Cour de nostre Souverain Seigneur le\r\nRoy d’Angleterre en l’Isle de Guernereye. Le quatorzième jour du moys\r\nd’Octobre, l’an MCCIV. Sur la Remonstrance qui nous a esté faicte de la\r\npart des Frères Jean Agenor, Prieur, en la Paroisse de l’Archange de\r\nSaint Michel du Valle et ses aliez Pierre de Beauvoir, Pierre Martin,\r\nJean Effart, Jean Jehan, Pierre Nicolle, Pierre du Prey, Jean Agenor,\r\nMichel le Pelley, Jean Cappelle et autres Marchands et Manans, tant en\r\nla Paroisse du Valle que de Saint Sampson, qu’ils éstoyent grandement\r\nempeschez et endomagez concernant le desbordement de la mer, laquelle\r\nauroit coupé le Douvre et passage commode entre les dittes Paroisses,\r\nentendu qu’il estoit impossible non seulement de faire Procession, mais\r\naussi d’aller traficquer les uns avec les autres aux Landes du Sarazin,\r\ns’il ne nous pleust leur permettre et accorder de faire maintenir\r\nun certain Pont passant du Valle à Saint Sampson, estant propre et\r\npassable de toutes Marées, de Charues, et Charettes, de pied et de\r\nCheval, et à qui il appartiendra de la maintenir en temps advenir.\r\nParquoy ne voulant refuser la Raisonnable remonstrance des avants dits,\r\net pour le bien public, nous leur avons appointé Veue sur les Limites\r\nles plus célèbres des dittes Paroisses, dans le jour Saint Barthelemi\r\nprochain, et advertiront le commun de s’y trouver, pour ouir ce que par\r\nnous sera ordonné touchant la ditte edification.”\r\n\r\nAnother copy, which differs from the preceding in the names of the\r\nJurats, finishes by these words, “donné par copie des roles, signé\r\npar Colin de la Lande, clerq.” According to this copy the names of\r\nthe Jurats are “Jean Le Gros, James Le Marchant, Pierre de la Lande,\r\nRobert de la Salle, Colin Henry, Raoul Emery, Gaultier Blondel, Guillet\r\nLe Febvre.” It is noticeable that the first four names of the copy\r\nfirst cited are not among these, and that the last three on this list\r\nare not in the Act which we have transcribed.[34] At the end of the\r\nsecond copy we find the following notice: “N.B.--Mr. Thomas Le Maître,\r\nPrevost de St. Sauveur à Jersey en a l’original.”\r\n\r\nOriginally the vavassors[35] of the Court of St. Michael were twelve in\r\nnumber, similar to the Jurats of the Royal Court, but if you ask why\r\nthe number for the last two hundred years has been reduced to eleven,\r\nthe answer is--“that the devil carried away Vivien.” All that is known\r\nabout Jean Vivien is that he was a vavassor of this Court, and that, in\r\na fit of despair, he drowned himself, early in the seventeenth century.\r\nUp to about the middle of the present century three letters “I. V. V.”\r\ncut by himself on the broken fragment of rock from which he leapt into\r\nthe gulf, still existed at the end of a footpath, not far from the\r\n“Fosse au Courlis”--Curlew’s ditch or grave--a spot haunted by witches.\r\n\r\nSince then no Christian has dared to replace the suicide Jean Vivien,\r\nand, when making the calculation of the symbolic vavassorial stones,\r\nhis pebble is always omitted. There are but eleven instead of twelve.\r\n\r\n[27] “There were two Nigels (Neel or Niel), Viscounts of Cotentin,\r\nand proprietors of St. Sauveur le Vicomte. I have reference to those\r\ntwo charters, the perusal of which exalts conjectures into genuine\r\n_facts_. It is highly gratifying to possess, at last, extracts from the\r\nauthentic charters of Robert I. and William II. granted to St. Michel\r\nand St. Martin of Tours.”--Extract from MS. letter from George Métivier\r\nto Sir Edgar MacCulloch, Nov. 1846.\r\n\r\n[28] According to Mr. Métivier Guernsey was called “Holy Island” in\r\nthe days of a learned Greek called “Sylla,” the friend of Plutarch’s\r\ngrandfather, and he says that it was the custom for persons to go from\r\nthe “ogygian” (Gallic or Breton) Islands, to Delos every century,\r\nwhich means every thirty years. The voyagers also visited the temple\r\nof Dodona; and on their return from Delos “the sacred navigators\r\nwere conducted by the winds to the Isle of Saturn or Sacred Island\r\n(Guernsey), which was peopled entirely by themselves and their\r\npredecessors; for although they were by their laws permitted to return\r\nafter having served Saturn thirty years, which was the century of\r\nthe Druids, yet they frequently preferred remaining in the tranquil\r\nretirement of this island to returning to their birth-places.”\r\nDemetrius, also, says: “Among the islands which lie adjacent to\r\nBritain, some are desert, known by the name of the Isles of Heroes.…\r\nI embarked in the suite of the Emperor, who was about to visit the\r\nnearest of them. We found thereon but few inhabitants, and these were\r\naccounted _sacred and inviolable_.” Mr. Métivier goes on to say later\r\n“Onomacritus, an author who flourished five hundred years B.C., in one\r\nof his poems speaks of a vessel that conveyed the ashes of the dead\r\nbetween England and Spain, and a celebrated Greek author of undoubted\r\nveracity, Procopius, who wrote about 547 A.D., states that the “Breton\r\nfishermen of an island subject to the French, were exempt from all\r\ntribute, because they conveyed the dead into a neighbouring island.”\r\nThe Breton French fishermen came from Jersey, “La Porte Sainte,” and\r\nterminated their funeral voyage at Guernsey, “l’Ile Bienheureuse.”\r\nThe ashes of the dead were deposited in our _croutes_ and sacred\r\nenclosures, within the tombs composed of _five_ horizontal stones,\r\nwhich number indicated the resting places of knightly heroes, or noble\r\nGauls.”--Métivier in the _Monthly Selection_, 1825, pp. 327 and 452.\r\n\r\n[29] EDITOR’S NOTE.--M. de Gerville denies the truth of this tradition.\r\nSee _Documents Inédits du Moyen Age, relatifs aux Iles du Cotentin_, p.\r\n16.\r\n\r\n[30] See _Gentleman’s Magazine Library_, Social Manners and Customs. P.\r\n51, Beating of Bounds at Grimsby.\r\n\r\n[31] EDITOR’S NOTE.--On the 27th April, 1533. The Court of St. Michel\r\ndu Valle ordered that the King’s Serjeant should “cry in the Market\r\nPlace for three Saturdays that the Chevauchée would take place in the\r\nfollowing month of May.”--_Fief Le Comte MSS._ copied by Colonel J. H.\r\nC. Carey.\r\n\r\n[32] As being of the same race and language as Wace, Walter Map and\r\nChrestien de Troyes, who were the first to collect and write of the\r\nArthurian legends,--or, as they are generally spoken of by French\r\nwriters “_Les Epopées de la Table Ronde_,”--it might reasonably be\r\nexpected that some traces of these old “romans” that must have so\r\ninfluenced our forefathers should linger among us. This “round table”\r\nso carefully hollowed out for the pions may be a relic of “La Table\r\nRonde,” of which Wace writes--\r\n\r\n    “Fist Artus la Roonde Table\r\n    Dont Bretons dient mainte fable.”\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say that Arthur instituted this Round Table in times of\r\npeace, for his feudal retainers, so that none might consider himself\r\nsuperior to his fellow knights and squires, for at such a table all\r\nmust be equal.\r\n\r\n[33] Now called the Câtel, and the Church of the said Parish is\r\ntraditionally built on the Castle formerly inhabited by “Le Grand\r\nSarazin,” and it was there or thereabouts that the Royal Court used to\r\nsit.\r\n\r\n[34] EDITOR’S NOTE.--I will here add a copy of the old orders issued by\r\nthe Cour de St. Michel in 1663, and copied from those issued in 1439.\r\nIt is taken word for word from a manuscript lent me by Colonel J.

In each of our parishes there are a certain number of\r\nfunctionaries called douzeniers, because the corps in question consists\r\nof twelve (douze) members, except in St. Peter Port, where there are\r\ntwenty, and at St. Michel du Valle, where there are sixteen. When one\r\nof these officers was elected, he had to give a feast, to which the\r\nelectors carried an enormous bouquet of flowers “à deux hanses”--with\r\ntwo handles. The dinner finished and the cloth removed, each man filled\r\nhis glass, and the abdicating douzenier (le douzenier _déhansé_) broke\r\none of these handles, previously dipping the bouquet into his glass,\r\nand drinking the health of the douzenier _hansé_. Then the bouquet went\r\nround from hand to hand, each man, while moistening it with the spirit\r\nthat bubbled in his glass, adding his toast to the newly elected or\r\n_hansé_ douzenier.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Customs--Aquatic.\r\n\r\n    “Heureux peuple des champs, vos travaux sont des fêtes.”\r\n\r\n                                            --_St. Lambert._\r\n\r\n\r\nVraicing.\r\n\r\nThe months of June, July, and August, form one of the principal seasons\r\nfor the collection of the seaweed with which the rocky shores of\r\nGuernsey abound, and which, from time immemorial, has proved a most\r\nvaluable resource to the farmer, not only as affording an excellent\r\nmanure for the land, but also, in the case of the poorer cottagers and\r\nfishermen who inhabit the coast, an unfailing supply of fuel. Many\r\nindeed of these gain almost their entire livelihood by collecting\r\nthe “vraic” as it is locally termed, which they sell to their richer\r\nneighbours for dressing the land, or which, after drying on the shore,\r\nthey stack for their winter firing. The ashes, which are carefully\r\npreserved, always command a ready market, being considered one of\r\nthe best manures that can be applied to the land in preparing it for\r\ncertain crops. The qualities of seaweed in general as a fertilizer are\r\nso highly appreciated that it has given rise to the agricultural adage\r\n“_point de vraic, point de hautgard_”--no sea-weed, no stack yard. It\r\nhas been remarked that dry seasons are unfavourable to the growth of\r\nsea-weed, and that rain is almost as essential to its development as it\r\nis to that of the grass of the field--a singular fact, when we remember\r\nthat the marine plant has always a supply of moisture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vraicing.]\r\n\r\nSea-weed is distinguished into two kinds “_vraic venant_”--drift weed,\r\nand “_vraic scié_”--cut weed. The former is that which, like the\r\nleaves and branches of a tree, are severed from the place of growth by\r\nnatural decay, or by the violence of storms, and is thrown up by the\r\naction of the waves on the shore. The latter is that which is detached\r\nfrom the rocks by the hand of man, generally with the aid of a small\r\nsickle. The collecting of sea-weed, whether drift or cut, is subject to\r\nstringent regulations, framed with a view both of preventing dangerous\r\nquarrels among those engaged in the occupation, and also of ensuring a\r\nregular supply of so precious a commodity by allowing sufficient time\r\nfor its growth. In Guernsey the Royal Court has always legislated on\r\nthe subject, but on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany it appears to\r\nhave been the province of the Church to regulate the matter, and the\r\nharvesting of the sea-weed never began until the parish priest had\r\nsolemnly blessed the undertaking.\r\n\r\nDriftweed may be collected at all seasons, but only between sunrise\r\nand sunset. It is found left on the beach by the retiring tide, or\r\nis dragged on shore by means of long rakes from amidst the breakers\r\nthat roll in during, or after, heavy gales. This is hard work, and\r\nnot unattended with danger. The men are frequently up to their waists\r\nin the water, and the shelving pebbly beach affords but an insecure\r\nfooting. The rakes are often wrenched out of the men’s hands by the\r\nviolence of the waves, and hurled back among them, inflicting severe\r\nbruises and sometimes even broken limbs. The collecting of the cut\r\nweed or “_vraic scié_” is quite another thing. Although entailing a\r\ngreat deal of labour, it is looked upon, especially in summer, as a\r\nsort of holiday. There are two seasons during which it is lawful to\r\ncut: the first begins with the first spring-tide after Candlemas, and\r\nlasts about five weeks, during the whole of which time every person\r\nis allowed to collect as much as he wants for manuring his lands. The\r\nsecond cutting, which is chiefly for fuel, commences about Midsummer\r\nand lasts until the middle of August. Immemorial usage, strengthened\r\nby legal enactment, has consecrated the first eight days of cutting at\r\nthis season to the poor. During this time none but those who are too\r\npoor to possess a horse or cart are allowed the privilege of gathering\r\nthe vraic, which, when cut, they must bring to high water mark on\r\ntheir backs. After this concession to the less fortunate brethren, the\r\nharvest is thrown open to all. Then it is that the country people,\r\nuniting in parties consisting frequently of two or three neighbouring\r\nfamilies, resort to the beach with their carts, to watch the ebbing\r\ntide, and secure a favourable spot for their operations. All who can\r\nbe spared from the necessary routine work of the farm attend on these\r\noccasions. The younger people adorn their hats with wreaths of flowers,\r\nthe horses’ heads are decked with nosegays, and even the yoke of the\r\npatient ox is not without its floral honours. Once arrived on the\r\nsea-shore, not a moment is lost, for time and tide wait for no man,\r\nand first come, first served. The sickle is plied vigorously, and\r\nsmall heaps of the precious weed are collected and marked with a flat\r\npebble, on which the name or initials of the proprietor are chalked.\r\nThe men wade across the “cols” or natural causeways leading to the\r\noutlying rocks, and, when the tide begins to flow, hastily load the\r\ncarts, or the ample panniers with which the horses are provided, and\r\nhurry off to deposit their hard-earned store above high-water mark. In\r\nthe meantime the younger members of the party range along the beach,\r\nturning over the stones in search of that esteemed mollusc the “ormer”\r\nor sea-ear (_Haliotis tuberculata_) which, when well cooked--a secret\r\nonly known to a native of the isles--is really a delicious morsel. Not\r\nunfrequently crabs of various kinds are turned out of their hiding\r\nplaces, and hurry off, holding up their formidable pincers in defiance\r\nand defence, but are soon adroitly transferred to the “_behotte_”--a\r\nsmall basket, narrow mouthed and flattened on one side, which hangs\r\nby a belt from the shoulder of the youth or maiden. Here and there\r\na larger mass of rock is with difficulty raised, and a goodly sized\r\nconger-eel, disturbed from his snug retreat, glides away like a snake\r\nand endeavours to hide himself in the grass-like “_plize_” (_Zostera\r\nMarina_). A blow on the head stuns him, and he goes to join the\r\ncaptive ormers and crabs. Perhaps one of those hideous monsters of the\r\ndeep, the cuttle fish, is dislodged. His long tentacles, armed with\r\ninnumerable suckers, which attach themselves strongly to anything they\r\ntouch, his parrot-like bill and large projecting eyes, staring with a\r\nfixed gaze, are calculated to inspire alarm, but the trenchant sickle\r\nmakes short work of him, and his scattered limbs remain on the spot to\r\nform a meal for the crabs.\r\n\r\nThe laugh and the jest are to be heard on all sides--even the brute\r\ncreation seem to enjoy the change. The horses, generally quiet, scamper\r\nover the sands and rocks, neighing joyously to one another; the farm\r\ndogs are busy hunting the small crabs that everywhere abound, or\r\nrushing into the water after the stones thrown by the children. A\r\nmore animated scene can nowhere be witnessed, and, when lighted up by\r\na bright summer sun, none more worthy of being studied by the artist.\r\nThe rich colouring of the rocks, the lustrous bronzed tints of the\r\nmoist sea-weed, the delicate hues of the transparent water as it lies\r\nunruffled in the small pools left by the retiring wave, the groups of\r\noxen and horses with their shining summer coats, and the merry faces of\r\nthe peasantry, form a picture which no true lover of nature can ever\r\nforget. But the tide is rising, and drives the busy crowd before it.\r\nBefore, however, they leave the strand, the younger men choose their\r\nfavourite lasses, and lead them, already thoroughly drenched, to meet\r\nthe advancing wave. Hand-in-hand they venture in; the confiding girl\r\nis enticed onwards, and suddenly finds herself immersed over head and\r\nears in the water. Some, more coy, feign to fly, sure to be overtaken\r\nand share the same fate. The whole scene is vividly portrayed by Mr.\r\nMétivier in his poem of the “Sea Weeders” written in 1812.\r\n\r\nAt last, all re-assemble on the grassy sward that lines the shore,\r\nand join their respective parties. The careful housewife has baked\r\nbeforehand a plentiful supply of “gâche” and biscuits; the rich\r\ngolden-coloured butter has been kept from the market, much to the\r\nannoyance of the thrifty matron in town, who finds the price enhanced\r\nin consequence; the small barrel of cider is broached, and all make a\r\nhearty meal. The remaining hours of daylight are employed in carting\r\naway the vraic or spreading it out on the downs to dry, and, when\r\nnight has set in, many assemble again at some neighbouring tavern and\r\nend the day with song and dance. The old fashioned “_chifournie_” or\r\nhurdy-gurdy--the _rote_ of mediæval times--has given way to the modern\r\nfiddle, but the songs are still those that delighted their ancestors.\r\nMost, if not all of them, have been originally derived from France,\r\nwhere it is far from improbable that they are now forgotten except in\r\nsome remote country villages, but it is curious to find that they are\r\nstill sung by the Canadian boatmen, and “Belle Rose, au Rosier Blanc”\r\nand “A la Claire Fontaine” are as familiar to the American descendants\r\nof the Normans as they are to the Guernsey peasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrmering.\r\n\r\nAnother favourite amusement of the young people in the country,\r\nbesides the merry-making which accompanies and follows the collection\r\nof sea-weed in summer, is the forming of parties to take the ormer, a\r\nshell-fish which abounds at low water at the spring-tides in spring\r\nand autumn. The ormer is the _Haliotis tuberculata_ of naturalists,\r\nand derives its name from its resemblance in shape to an ear--_auris\r\nmarina_--“oreille de mer.” The shell, which was formerly thrown away,\r\nis now carefully collected and exported, as it enters largely into the\r\njapanned ware manufactured at Birmingham and elsewhere, the lustre of\r\nthe interior of the shell surpassing in brilliancy and variety of tints\r\nthat of the best mother-of-pearl. It is not, however, for the sake of\r\nthe shell that this mollusc is sought, but for the fish itself, which,\r\nafter being well beaten to make it tender, and cooked in brown sauce,\r\nforms a favourite dish. Like the limpet, the ormer adheres strongly to\r\nthe rock, from which it requires some degree of strength to detach it,\r\nbut it seems to possess considerable powers of locomotion, and appears\r\nto come up from the deep water at certain seasons of the year, probably\r\nfor the purpose of depositing its ova. It is a curious instance of the\r\nlocal distribution of animal life that, although the ormer is known in\r\nthe Mediterranean, and is found all along the western shores of Spain\r\nand France, and in great quantities on the coasts of Brittany, it has\r\nnever been discovered much to the eastward of Cherbourg, nor on the\r\nEnglish side of the Channel.\r\n\r\nThe localities in which the ormer abounds are the rocky bays, of which\r\nthere are so many around our coast, and there it is found at the proper\r\nseasons adhering to the under surface of the loose boulders. It is no\r\ntrifling work to turn over these stones, but the searcher often returns\r\nhome laden with several hundred ormers, and not infrequently he has\r\nalso added a crab or a conger to his store.\r\n\r\n\r\nSand-Eeling.\r\n\r\nThe catching of the sand-eel, or “_lanchon_” as it is locally termed,\r\ntakes place on nights when the moon is at her full, and at low water:\r\nit is pursued more as a recreation than as a source of profit. Parties\r\nof young men and women unite and resort to some sandy bay or creek as\r\nthe tide is ebbing, armed with blunted sickles, two-pronged forks, or\r\nany instrument with which the sand can be easily stirred. The fish,\r\non being disturbed, rise to the surface of the sand with a leap. They\r\nare very agile in their movements, but their bright silvery sides,\r\nglittering in the moon-beams, betray them to their active pursuers, and\r\nbefore they have time to burrow again in the sand they are caught with\r\nthe hand and transferred to the basket. It is more easy to imagine than\r\ndescribe the fun and merriment to which this sport gives rise; how in\r\nthe eagerness of the pursuit, a false step will place the incautious\r\nmaiden up to the waist in a pool of water, and subject her to the good\r\nnatured laughter of her merry companions; how an apparently accidental\r\npush from behind will cause a youth, who is stooping down to gather\r\nup the fish, to measure his whole length on the wet sand; or how a\r\nmalicious step will splash one or more of the party from top to toe. To\r\nthe lovers of the picturesque the localities in which this sport takes\r\nplace add not a little to the charm of the scene. The broad sands of\r\nVazon Bay, those of La Saline and other creeks on the western shores\r\nof the island, hemmed in on all sides by reefs of rock, and, above\r\nall, that most lovely spot called Le Petit Port, which lies at the\r\nfoot of the precipitous cliffs of Jerbourg, seen in the full light of\r\nthe harvest moon, leave impressions on the mind that are not easily\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nAlthough the coasts of the island abound in fish of various sorts,\r\nsea-fishing, as an amusement, is very little resorted to. The reason\r\nof this is no doubt to be found in the strong tides and currents and\r\ndangerous rocks which surround us on every side, and which render\r\nit imprudent to venture out to sea unless under the guidance of an\r\nexperienced pilot. Of late years, however, the extension of the harbour\r\nworks into deep water has brought the fish within reach without the\r\nrisk of hazarding one’s life by venturing on the fickle sea, and\r\nthe “contemplative man’s amusement” is becoming daily more and more\r\npopular. Crowds of men and boys may be seen in all sorts of weather\r\nand at all hours of the day angling from the pier heads, and not\r\ninfrequently making very fair catches.\r\n\r\nAlthough prawns and shrimps are tolerably plentiful, there are but\r\nfew who take the trouble of catching them for the market, but the\r\npursuit of these delicate crustaceans is a favourite amusement, and\r\nis occasionally indulged in by persons of all ranks, the shores of\r\nHerm and Jethou, and the bays of the Pezerie and Rocquaine being the\r\nbest spots at low tide for the sport. Inglis, in his work on the\r\nChannel Islands, remarks “that so various are tastes in the matter of\r\nrecreation, that he has seen individuals who found as much pleasure in\r\nwading for half-a-day, knee-deep among rocks, to make capture of some\r\nhandfuls of shrimps, as has ever been afforded to others in the pursuit\r\nof the deer or the fox.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Parish Church of S. Peter Port. A.D. 1846.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Customs--Ceremonial.\r\n\r\n    “What art thou, thou idle ceremony?\r\n    What kind of god art thou, that suffer’st more\r\n    Of mortal grief than do thy worshippers!\r\n    Art thou aught else but place, degree, and form?”\r\n\r\n                                     --_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\nAlthough the doctrines of the Reformation were introduced into Guernsey\r\nin the reign of Edward VI., and perhaps earlier, and the Liturgy put\r\nforth by authority in the reign of that monarch was translated into\r\nFrench and used in the churches,[36] it was not until the reign of\r\nElizabeth that the island became wholly Protestant.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the Channel Islands had formed part of the Diocese\r\nof Coutances in Normandy,[37] an arrangement which led to much\r\ninconvenience in times of war between France and England. Queen\r\nElizabeth put an end to this connection in the year 1568,[38] and\r\nattached the islands to the See of Winchester; but it was not until the\r\nRestoration of Charles II. that the change took full effect, and that\r\nthe islands were brought entirely within the discipline of the Church\r\nof England by authority of the Bill of Uniformity.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that it was part of Queen Elizabeth’s policy to\r\nfavour the Huguenot party in France; and that in times of persecution\r\nthe followers of the Reformed faith always met with an hospitable\r\nreception in England. The Channel Islands, lying so close to the coast\r\nof France, and speaking the same language as was used in continental\r\nNormandy, were naturally chosen as places of refuge in times of\r\npersecution by the French Protestants, many of whom--and among them\r\nseveral ministers--resorted thither until more settled times enabled\r\nthem to return to their own homes. The old Roman Catholic rectors of\r\nthe parishes in Guernsey, who, apparently, had given a sort of half\r\nadhesion to the intermediate order of things, and had been allowed to\r\nretain possession of a portion, at least, of the emoluments of their\r\nbenefices, seem to have disappeared altogether shortly after the\r\nexcommunication of the Queen by Pope Pius V. in 1570.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Guernsey, Sir Thomas Leighton, who favoured the views\r\nof the Puritan party in the Church, filled up the vacant pulpits with\r\nFrench refugee ministers, and probably it would have been difficult\r\nat that time to find any others.[39] The same course seems to have\r\nbeen followed in Jersey. These ministers very naturally preferred\r\ntheir own form of conducting divine worship to that of the Anglican\r\nChurch, and, on the representation of the Governors of both the\r\nislands, permission was given by the Queen for the use of the Genevan\r\nform in the churches of the towns of St. Peter Port in Guernsey, and\r\nof St. Helier in Jersey. This permission was renewed by King James\r\nI. on his accession to the throne; and the natural consequence was,\r\nthat not only the Presbyterian form of worship soon spread into every\r\nparish in the islands, but that the Presbyterian discipline and\r\nChurch government were firmly established, and the authority of the\r\nBishop of Winchester totally ignored. To this discipline the people\r\nof Guernsey clung with great pertinacity, and the attempts during the\r\nGreat Rebellion of the Brownists and other fanatical sects to introduce\r\ntheir peculiar doctrines, met with little or no favour. It was not\r\nwithout some opposition that Episcopacy was brought in, most of the\r\nministers refusing to conform to the new order of things, and giving\r\nup their livings in consequence.[40] The people had nothing to say in\r\nthe matter: they were bound by the Act of Uniformity, but, in deference\r\nto their feelings and prejudices, certain practices were allowed to be\r\nretained, and certain others dispensed with.\r\n\r\nNo great objection could be made to a set form of prayer, for something\r\nof the kind was in use in the French Reformed Church; but the Litany\r\nof the Church of England seems to have given great offence--probably\r\nfrom its close resemblance to some of those used in the Romish\r\nChurch--insomuch that many persons at first abstained altogether\r\nfrom attending the morning service; and, although in the present\r\nday no objection exists to this, or any other part of the Liturgy,\r\nit is, perhaps, owing to habits then contracted, and handed down\r\nfrom generation to generation, that so many, especially in the rural\r\nparishes, absent themselves from church in the forenoon. The use of the\r\nsign of the cross in baptism, in deference to the strong prejudices\r\nof the people, who seem to have looked upon it as the Mark of the\r\nBeast, was not at first insisted upon, but, in order to counteract\r\nthis feeling, the thirtieth Canon “On the lawful use of the Cross in\r\nBaptism,” was inserted at the end of the Baptismal Service in the\r\nFrench translation of the Book of Common Prayer printed for use in the\r\nislands, and there is every reason to believe that the objection to\r\nthis practice soon died out.\r\n\r\nProbably, kneeling at the Holy Communion was received with little\r\nfavour, for we find that the first introduction of this practice on\r\nthe 12th of October, 1662, was thought worthy of a note in a journal\r\nkept by a parish clerk and schoolmaster of that day--Pierre Le Roy--who\r\nwisely abstained from any comment on the event. To this day appliances\r\nfor kneeling are rare in many pews, and at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century most of the congregation remained seated during the\r\nsinging of the metrical psalms, as is the practice in the Presbyterian\r\nchurches in Scotland and on the Continent.\r\n\r\nBaptismal fonts are of recent introduction, the order to put them up in\r\nall the parish churches having been given by the Bishop of Winchester\r\n(Dr. C. R. Sumner) on the occasion of his primary visitation to this\r\nportion of his diocese in September, 1829, he being the first Prelate\r\nof that See who had deigned to inspect the state of the churches in\r\nthe islands since the time that they were placed under the care of an\r\nAnglican Bishop by Queen Elizabeth. Before fonts were provided, the\r\nrite of baptism was administered at the altar, the minister, standing\r\nwithin the rail, receiving the water at the proper moment from the\r\nclerk, who poured it into his hand from a silver ewer.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of periodical visits from a Bishop, the rite of\r\nconfirmation had, of course, become a dead letter. It was administered\r\nin 1818, for the first time since the Reformation, by Dr. Fisher,\r\nBishop of Salisbury, who had been deputed to consecrate two\r\nnewly-erected churches by the then Bishop of Winchester, who was too\r\nold and infirm to undertake the duty himself. Before that time--and\r\nindeed for some considerable time later--it was customary to give\r\nnotice from the pulpit, previously to the quarterly celebration of the\r\nHoly Communion, that young persons desirous of communicating for the\r\nfirst time should attend in the vestry on a certain day. This notice\r\nwas, of course, given in the parish churches in French--the language of\r\nthe great majority of the people of that time--and the word used for\r\n“vestry,” and which we have so translated, was “Consistoire.” No doubt,\r\nunder the Presbyterian discipline, the examination of catechumens took\r\nplace before the Consistory, composed of the minister and elders of the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nTill a comparatively recent period the Holy Communion was only\r\nadministered quarterly, and at the great festivals of Christmas,\r\nEaster, Whitsuntide and Michaelmas. A preparatory sermon was generally\r\npreached at an evening service held on the day before the communion,\r\nand on this occasion a metrical version of the Decalogue was usually\r\nsung instead of a psalm or hymn. This was a practice borrowed from the\r\nFrench Reformed Church, as was also that of singing the 100th Psalm\r\nwhile the non-communicants were leaving the church, some portions of\r\nthe 103rd Psalm while the communion was being administered, and, just\r\nbefore the final benediction, the Song of Simeon, “Nunc Dimittis.”\r\n\r\nMen and women communicated separately, the men first and the women\r\nafterwards,--a relic doubtless of the time when they were kept apart in\r\nthe church. No one thought of leaving the rails until all who knelt at\r\nthe same time had communicated, when the officiating minister dismissed\r\nthem with these words:--\r\n\r\n    “Allez en paix; vivez en paix,\r\n    Et que le Dieu de Paix vous bénisse.”\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n    “Que le Dieu de Paix soit avec vous.”\r\n\r\nThey then retired to make room for others. In parishes where weekly\r\ncollections were made at the church door for the relief of the poor,\r\nit was customary for the minister to say immediately after the final\r\nbenediction:\r\n\r\n    “Allez en paix; vivez en paix;\r\n    Et en sortant de ce temple souvenez vous des pauvres.”\r\n\r\nAll these peculiar customs, which had been handed down from\r\nPresbyterian times, are rapidly disappearing. In the days when the\r\ncelebration of the Lord’s Supper was confined to stated days, it was\r\nthe custom in some of the country parishes to deck out the churches for\r\nthe occasion with branches of evergreens, as at Christmas. Also, on the\r\nday of the communion it was considered irregular to appear in coloured\r\nclothes. Black was universally worn, and many old people, both in town\r\nand country, but especially in the country, keep to the old custom.\r\n\r\nThe practice of publishing the banns of marriage immediately after the\r\nrecital of the Nicene Creed, and not after the Second Lesson, as is\r\ndone in England, has been retained in Guernsey; the Act of Parliament\r\nof George II., which was supposed to change the custom of the church\r\nin this respect, and to do away with the express injunctions in the\r\nrubric, not including the Channel Islands in its provisions. In the\r\ncountry parishes, where the cemeteries are in the immediate vicinity\r\nof the churches, it is now--though it was not so in former days--the\r\ncustom to carry the corpse into the church for the reading of the\r\nappointed Psalms and Lesson; but in Town, where the burial-grounds\r\nare, for the most part, at some considerable distance from the sacred\r\nbuilding, this part of the service was, till of late years, entirely\r\ndispensed with. It is customary, however, for the Clergy, sometimes to\r\nthe number of three or four, to attend at the house of the deceased, if\r\ninvited so to do, and to head the procession to the church or cemetery.\r\nA pious custom existed formerly--which, one is sorry to say, has of\r\nlate years fallen almost entirely into disuse--no man ever commenced a\r\nnew work, or even began the usual routine work of the season, without\r\nmaking use of these words “Au nom de Dieu soit!” Wills and many other\r\nlegal documents, the books in which the Acts of the Royal Court and\r\nof the States of the island are registered, as well as those used by\r\nmerchants and tradesmen in their business, all commenced with this\r\nformula. In many cases it evidently took the place of the sign of the\r\ncross. All sittings of the Royal Court and of the States of the island,\r\nas well as the meetings of parishioners in the Vestry, and of the\r\nparochial councils known as Douzaines, are opened by the recitation of\r\nthe Lord’s Prayer, and closed by the Apostolic Benediction.\r\n\r\n[36] EDITOR’S NOTE.--_Comet_, June 29th, 1889.--“At the sale of Lord\r\nCrawford’s effects, held in London last week, Messrs.

Rymer. Vol. VIII.\r\np. 131.\r\n\r\n[38] EDITOR’S NOTE.--It was the excommunication of Queen Elizabeth\r\nby the Pope that led to the transference of the Channel Islands from\r\nthe Diocese of Coutances to that of Winchester. Canon MacColl in his\r\n“Reformation Settlement” notes as an extraordinary fact that the\r\nBishop of Coutances so far disapproved of that excommunication as\r\nto have offered, on condition that his jurisdiction was allowed, to\r\ngive institution to those clergy whom the Queen might nominate from\r\nthe English Universities. In fact, up to the date of the bull of\r\nexcommunication, the islands remained under the jurisdiction of the\r\nBishop of Coutances, who permitted the use of the reformed Prayer Book,\r\nand ruled, apparently without a protest, over a portion of his diocese,\r\nin which the claim to supremacy on the part of the Pope was denied.\r\n\r\n[39] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Mr. Matthieu Le Lièvre gives a slightly different\r\nversion. He says:--“Parmi ceux qui avaient quitté Guernesey pour\r\néchapper au coups de la réaction catholique, se trouvait Guillaume\r\nBeauvoir, membre de l’une des familles qui ont joué un grand rôle\r\ndans l’histoire de l’île, et qui occupa lui-même, pendant neuf ans\r\n(1572-1581), la dignité de bailli, la première magistrature du\r\npays.… Il s’éloigna donc et se refugia avec sa femme à Genève, où il\r\nséjourna quelque temps et se fit avantageusement connaître de Calvin\r\net de ses collègues. Rentré dans son île natale après la mort de la\r\nreine Marie, il fut frappé de la nécessité d’appeler au plus tôt un\r\nhomme de tête et de piété pour relever les affaires de la Réforme à\r\nGuernesey. Il écrivit donc aux pasteurs de Genève, et à Calvin en\r\nparticulier, pour leur demander un ministre. La Compagnie des Pasteurs\r\ns’en occupa et envoya à la jeune Eglise de Guernesey le ministre\r\nNicolas Baudoin, porteur de deux lettres de recommandation addressées\r\nà Guillaume Beauvoir, et signées, l’une Charles Despeville (l’un des\r\npseudonymes de Calvin) et l’autre Raymond Chauvet, l’un des Pasteurs\r\nde Genève.”--_Histoire du Méthodisme dans les Iles de la Manche_, par\r\nMatthieu Le Lièvre, D.D., pp. 38-39.\r\n\r\n[40] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Pierre Le Roy’s Diary, 24th Sept., 1662. “Il\r\nest arrivé dans cette ile une compagnie de cent soldats avec un\r\nmajor, un capitaine, et des officiers, à cause de quelque opposition\r\nà l’Acte d’Uniformité. Les ministres n’ont pas voulu s’y soumettre\r\net ont abandonné leurs cures, savoir M. Le Marchant, du Valle et de\r\nSaint-Samson; M. Perchard, de Saint Pierre-du-Bois; M. Morehead, de\r\nSaint-Sauveur; M. de la Marche, du Câtel, et M. Hérivel, de la Forêt\r\net de Torteval.” John de Sausmarez, formerly Rector of St. Martin’s\r\nparish, was made Dean in 1662, and he and one of his colleagues,\r\nPierre de Jersey, were the first to establish the new ritual. Thomas\r\nLe Marchant, who was virtually the head of the Presbyterian party,\r\nand as such was especially hated by Dean de Sausmarez, was shut up\r\nfirst in Castle Cornet in 1663, and in 1665 in the Tower of London,\r\ntill September, 1667, when he was liberated, “ayant donné caution de\r\nmille livres sterling qu’il ne présumera pas en aucun temps d’aller\r\ndans l’île de Guernesey à moins qu’il n’ait pour le faire une license\r\nspéciale de Sa Majesté, et qu’il se comportera à l’avenir comme un\r\nrespectueux et loyal sujet,” etc. He had married Olympe Roland, and\r\nhis son Eléazar was later Lieutenant Bailiff of Guernsey.--See also\r\n_Histoire du Methodisme dans les Isles de la Manche_, par Matthieu Le\r\nLièvre, 1885, p. 112.\r\n\r\n\r\nBirth and Baptism.\r\n\r\nOn the birth of a child notice is usually sent to the nearest\r\nrelations, and as soon as the mother is sufficiently recovered she\r\nreceives the visits and congratulations of her friends. It is customary\r\nto offer cake and wine to the visitors on these occasions. The wine\r\nmust on no account be refused, but the health of the child must be\r\nduly drunk, and the glass drained, for it is considered extremely\r\nunlucky to leave a drop behind. The christening feast still retains the\r\nancient name of “_Les Aubailles_” from the white garment or alb--in\r\nFrench “aube”--with which, in the early church, the recipients of\r\nbaptism were solemnly invested. It is customary for the sponsors to\r\nmake a present to the child, which usually takes the form of silver\r\nspoons, or a drinking cup. Before the re-establishment of Episcopacy\r\nat the Restoration there appears to have been only one sponsor of each\r\nsex. Of course the rubric which orders that every boy shall have two\r\ngodfathers, and every girl two godmothers, is now complied with, but\r\nthe second is invariably styled by the people the “little” godfather or\r\ngodmother, and is often a child or very young person evidently only put\r\nin to comply with the requirements of the church.\r\n\r\nThe excess of feasting at baptisms and churchings as well as at\r\nmarriages and funerals seems to have reached to such an extent in\r\nthe early part of the seventeenth century as to call for repressive\r\nmeasures on the part of the legislature, at that time deeply imbued\r\nwith a puritanical spirit, and sumptuary laws of a very stringent\r\nnature were promulgated restricting the invitations on these occasions\r\nto the nearest relations, and prohibiting entirely all dancing, and\r\neven almsgiving.\r\n\r\nAfter baptism the child is sent round to its nearest relatives, and the\r\nold women say that a present of some sort, preferably an egg, should be\r\nplaced in the infant’s hands, while visitors to the child are always\r\nexpected to put some money in the infant’s hand for luck, and as a\r\ntoken that it shall never want, the value of the gift being of little\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nIt is thought very unlucky to measure or weigh a child, such a\r\nproceeding being sure to stop its growth; and it is also supposed to be\r\nvery unlucky to cover up a baby’s face when taking it to the church to\r\nbe christened, until the ceremony is over.\r\n\r\nIt is considered peculiarly unlucky for three children to be presented\r\nat the font at the same time for baptism, as it is firmly believed that\r\none of the three is sure to die within the year.[41]--_Communicated by\r\nthe Rev. C. D. P. Robinson, Rector of St. Martin’s._\r\n\r\n[41] EDITOR’S NOTE.--This superstition still continues, and was told me\r\nin 1896 by Mrs. Le Patourel and others. The doomed baby is supposed to\r\nbe the one christened _second_, or the middle one, and you still hear\r\nwomen say when their child has been christened with two others, “Oh,\r\nbut mine was an _end_ one.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBetrothals and Weddings.\r\n\r\n    “As I have seene upon a Bridall day,\r\n    Full many maids clad in their best array,\r\n    In honour of the Bride come with their Flaskets\r\n    Fill’d full with flowers: others in wicker baskets\r\n    Bring forth from the Marsh rushes, to o’erspread\r\n    The ground whereon to Church the lovers tread;\r\n    Whilst that the quaintest youth of all the Plaine\r\n    Ushers their way with many a piping straine.”\r\n\r\n           --_Brown’s “Pastorals,” written before 1614._\r\n\r\nFrom the reign of Elizabeth to the Restoration of Charles II., the\r\nPresbyterian form of church government, with its rigorous discipline,\r\nprevailed in the Island, and the betrothal--“fiançailles”[42] of\r\npersons intending to take upon themselves the holy state of matrimony\r\nwas a solemn act, performed in the presence of the ministers and elders\r\nof the church, and which by an ordinance of the Royal Court of the year\r\n1572, was to be followed by marriage within six months at the latest.\r\nThe legislature of that day evidently disapproved of long engagements.\r\nThe promise was usually confirmed by a gift on the part of the\r\nbridegroom of some article of value, which was to be held by the bride\r\nas an earnest for the performance of the contract, and returned in case\r\nthe match was broken off by mutual consent. Traces of this custom are\r\nstill to be observed in the formal announcement of the engagement to\r\nrelations, and in the visits paid to them by the young couple in order\r\nto introduce each other reciprocally to those with whom they are to be\r\nhereafter more closely connected, as well as in the importance attached\r\nto the presents, locally termed “gages”[43] (pledges) given by the\r\nyoung man to his affianced bride.\r\n\r\nA round of entertainments usually succeeds the announcement of the\r\nintended marriage, at which in former days mulled wine used to be “de\r\nrigueur,” as indeed it was at all family merry makings and occasions of\r\nrejoicings.\r\n\r\nAmong the trading, agricultural, and labouring classes each party is\r\nexpected to bring his or her portion of the articles necessary to set\r\nup housekeeping. The man, for example, provides the bedstead, the\r\nwoman, the bed and the household linen, and very often the crockery\r\nand furniture. All, however, is looked upon as belonging to the\r\nwife, and is frequently secured to her by a regular contract entered\r\ninto before marriage, so that in case of the husband getting into\r\npecuniary difficulties, his creditors cannot lay claim to the household\r\nfurniture. The handsomely carved oaken chests, or large leather-covered\r\nboxes studded with brass nails, which were formerly to be seen in\r\nalmost all the old country houses, were used to contain the stock of\r\nlinen, and appear to have been in early days almost the only piece of\r\nornamental furniture of which the house could boast. This used to be\r\nbrought to the bridegroom’s residence, with the rest of the articles\r\nprovided by the bride, a day or two before the wedding, and with a\r\ncertain degree of form, the bridegroom, or his best man, conducting\r\nthe cart which contained them,[44] and the nearest unmarried female\r\nrelative of the bride carrying the looking-glass or some other valued\r\nor brittle article. A similar custom still exists in Normandy and\r\nBrittany. It is considered highly unlucky for a bride to take any other\r\nway in going to the church to be married than that which she follows\r\nwhen going thither for her usual devotions. Flowers and rushes are\r\ninvariably strewn in the path of the bride and bridegroom as they leave\r\nthe church, and before the door of their future habitation.[45]\r\n\r\nOn the first or second Sunday after their wedding the newly-married\r\npair appear in church attended by the best man and the bridesmaid,\r\nand it is a point of etiquette for the bride and bridegroom to read\r\nand sing out of the same book, however many books there may be in the\r\npew. Among well-to-do people a series of parties in honour of the\r\nyoung couple ensue, which in the dialect of the country are called\r\n“_reneuchons_,” “_neuches_” being the local pronunciation of the French\r\nword “noces.”\r\n\r\nIt appears from an ordinance of the Royal Court of 1625, when the\r\npuritanical spirit, which had come in with the Genevan discipline,\r\nwas at its height, that the poor at that time were in the habit of\r\nsoliciting alms at weddings, baptisms, and burials. This practice,\r\nas tending to keep up superstition and as dishonouring to God, was\r\nexpressly forbidden by the legislation under pain of corporal\r\npunishment to the beggar, and a fine to the giver of alms.[46]\r\n\r\n[42] “The custom of _flouncing_ is said to be peculiar to Guernsey.\r\nIt is an entertainment given by the parents of a young couple when\r\nthey are engaged, and the match has received approval. The girl\r\nis introduced to her husband’s family and friends by her future\r\nfather-in-law, and the man similarly by hers; after this they must keep\r\naloof from all flirtation, however lengthy the courtship may prove. The\r\nbelief is that if either party break faith the other side can lay claim\r\nto a moiety of his or her effects.”--From Brand’s _Popular Antiquities\r\nof Great Britain_. Vol. II., p. 56.\r\n\r\n[43] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Usually consisting of half-a-dozen or a dozen\r\n(according to the bridegroom’s means) silver spoons, and a pair of\r\nsugar tongs, marked with the initials of bride and the customary “bague\r\nde fiançailles.”\r\n\r\n[44] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Besides this it was customary amongst farmers for\r\nthe parents of a bride to give her a cow, and the animal in this case\r\nfollowed the cart.--_From Mr. J. de Garis, Rouvets, St. Saviour’s,\r\n1901._\r\n\r\n[45] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Les “gllajeurs”--the wild marsh iris--was always\r\none of the favourite flowers for strewing in front of the bride, and\r\nall the water-lanes and marshes were ransacked for it. The wedding\r\nfestivities generally lasted for two or three days. The house on the\r\nwedding day was decorated with wreaths and crowns of flowers, and, as\r\nusual, the festivities began with dinner, for which the usual fare was\r\nroast beef, roast mutton, a ham, plum pudding, and, of course, “gâche\r\nà corînthe,” washed down with cider. Then came games, songs, etc.,\r\ntill tea time, and then the tables would be cleared for dancing, while\r\nmulled wine, cheese, and Guernsey biscuits would be handed round at\r\nintervals. All the relations, friends, and neighbours of course partook\r\nof these festivities. A few songs were sung, “Jean, gros Jean,” being\r\na “sine quâ non” in the country parishes, and then the mulled wine was\r\nhanded round in cups, especially at midnight, as the clock struck. The\r\ncorrect formula before beginning to drink was\r\n\r\n    “Cher petit Pèpinot\r\n    Quand je te vè\r\n    Tu parais bien\r\n    Si je te bè, j’m’en sentirai\r\n    Et si je te laisse j’m’en repentirai,\r\n    Faut donc bien mieux bère, et m’en sentir\r\n    Que de te laisser, et m’n repentir!\r\n    A votre santâï la coumpagnie!”\r\n\r\nVery frequently at weddings people who knew what this formula led to\r\nput hanging beams from the “_pôutre_,” or central rafter for the men\r\nto hold on to! “À mon beau laurier qui danse” was of course always\r\ndanced at the weddings, “ma coummère, et quand je danse” was another\r\nvery favourite dance, the steps going to each syllable when sung, and\r\nthey also danced “Poussette,” which entirely consisted of the different\r\ninflections of the word “Poussette,” “Pou-set-te,” alternately chanted\r\nsmoothly or jerkily. This feasting and dancing was kept up till five or\r\nsix the next morning, and very often for the next night as well, while\r\non the third day all the old people and non-dancers were asked in to\r\nfinish up the feast in peace.--_From Mrs. Mollet, Mrs. Marquand, and\r\nMrs. Le Patourel._\r\n\r\nThere are certain gifts from a man to his fiancée which are supposed\r\nto be most unlucky to accept, as by so doing it would mean that the\r\nwedding would probably never take place. They are a watch and chain,\r\na brooch, and a Bible, and if he should present her with a knife or a\r\npair of scissors the only way to avert the ill-luck is to pay a penny\r\nfor them. Should a girl upset a chair before the wedding her marriage\r\nwill be delayed for a year. If a girl wishes to dream of the man she\r\nis to marry she must take some of the wedding cake on the day of\r\nthe wedding, pass it through a married woman’s wedding ring, or, if\r\npossible, the bride’s, (a widow’s is of no avail) and put it under her\r\npillow, and dream on it for five consecutive nights, and the _last_\r\ndream will come true.--_From Fanny Ingrouille._\r\n\r\nA correspondent sent the following query in 1857 to “_Notes and\r\nQueries_”:--“A month or two back a family, on leaving one of the\r\nChannel Islands, presented to a gardener (it is uncertain whether an\r\ninhabitant of the island or no) some pet doves, the conveyance of them\r\nto England being likely to prove troublesome. A few days afterwards the\r\nman brought them back, stating that _he was engaged to be married_,\r\nand the possession of the birds might be (as he had been informed) an\r\nobstacle to the course of true love remaining smooth.” This was put in\r\nthe shape of a query, but no answer appeared. Doves and wild pigeons in\r\nGuernsey are supposed to be most unlucky birds to have in a house, so\r\nprobably the gardener had been told that they would bring ill-luck on\r\nhis future “ménage” if he accepted them. The country people carry their\r\ndistrust of them so far that they say that their wings, worn in a hat,\r\nbring misfortune, and they are among the birds whose feathers in the\r\npillows of the dying prolong the death agony.\r\n\r\n“CHEVAUCHERIE D’ANE.”\r\n\r\nIf after marriage a couple do not agree well together, they are\r\nadmonished by their neighbours by what, in England, is called “rough\r\nmusic.” In Métivier’s Dictionary he describes two young people,\r\nboy and girl, back to back on a donkey, representing the guilty\r\nhusband and wife. They were followed by all the idlers of the\r\ndistrict singing a scurrilous rhyme, and surrounding the house of the\r\noffending pair, where the song and its accompaniments were kept up all\r\nnight.--_Métivier’s Dictionary, p. 23._\r\n\r\nNowadays putting the man and woman back to back on the donkey seems\r\nto be discontinued, but in St. Peter’s-in-the-Wood, Miss Le Pelley, a\r\nresident in the parish, writes “If the young men of this parish find\r\nout that a man has beaten his wife they form two parties on opposite\r\nsides of his house, at about a distance of one hundred yards from it,\r\nand blow conch shells, first one and then the other in answer. They\r\nkeep this noise up for a long time so that the married couple may feel\r\nashamed of themselves. I have not heard them just lately (1896), but\r\none year it was very frequent, and such a nuisance.”--See in Brand’s\r\n_Antiquities_, Vol. 2, p. 129, the articles on “Riding the Stang” in\r\nYorkshire, said also to be known in Scandinavia.\r\n\r\n[46] It is not unusual in the country parishes for the young men of\r\nthe neighbourhood to assemble around the house in the evening and to\r\nfire off their militia muskets or fowling pieces in honour of the\r\nwedding, in return for which they are regaled with a cup of wine to\r\ndrink the health of the newly-married pair. If the marriage is between\r\npersons connected with the shipping interest all the vessels in port\r\nmake a point of displaying their flags, and a few bottles of wine are\r\ndistributed in return among the crews. Marriages among the country\r\npeople are frequently celebrated on a Sunday, immediately before the\r\nmorning service. If it is the intention of the newly-married couple to\r\nattend the service they make it a point to leave the Church and return\r\nafter a short interval, as an idea prevails that if they remained in\r\nthe Church until the prayers of the day have been begun the marriage\r\nwould be illegal.--_From Rev. J. Giraud, Rector of Saint Saviour’s._\r\n\r\n\r\nDeaths and Funerals.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a death occurs in a family a servant or friend is\r\nimmediately sent round to announce the sad event to all the nearest\r\nrelatives of the deceased, and the omission of this formality is looked\r\nupon as a great slight, and a legitimate cause of offence. If any\r\nperson enter a house where a corpse is lying it is considered a mark of\r\ngreat disrespect not to offer a sight of it, and it is thought equally\r\ndisrespectful on the part of the visitor if the offer is declined, as\r\nthe refusal is supposed to bring ill-luck on the house. When the day\r\nis fixed for the funeral a messenger is sent to invite the friends\r\nand relatives to attend, and in times gone by if those to be invited\r\nresided at any distance it was considered proper that this messenger\r\nshould be mounted on a black horse. Formerly the funeral feast was\r\nuniversal, of late years it is seldom heard of except in some of the\r\nold country families of the middle classes, among whom ancient customs\r\ngenerally abide longer than among the classes immediately above or\r\nbelow them.\r\n\r\nThe lid of the coffin is not screwed down until all the guests are\r\nassembled, and the person whose business it is to see to it, comes into\r\nthe room where they are met, and invites them to take a last look.\r\nHearses are almost unknown, even in cases where the distance from the\r\nhouse to the cemetery is considerable. The coffin is almost invariably\r\nborne on the shoulders by hired bearers, but in former days it was only\r\npersons of a certain standing in society who were considered entitled\r\nto this honour; the poor were carried by their friends, three on each\r\nside, bearing the coffin slung between them. Care was always taken that\r\nthe corpse was carried to the church by the way the deceased was in the\r\nhabit of taking during his lifetime.[47]\r\n\r\nThe custom of females attending funerals, which was formerly universal,\r\nhas disappeared entirely from the town, but in the country it is still\r\noccasionally observed, the mourners being attired in long black cloaks\r\nwith hoods that almost conceal the face. The funeral feast, when there\r\nis one, takes place when the cortège returns to the house of mourning.\r\nA chair is placed at the table where the deceased was wont to sit,\r\nand a knife, fork, plate, etc., laid before it as if he were still\r\npresent.[48] Tea and coffee, wine, cider, and spirits, cakes, bread and\r\ncheese, and more especially a ham, are provided for the occasion. The\r\nlast-named viand was, in bygone days, almost considered indispensable,\r\nand where they kept pigs,--and almost everyone then kept pigs--every\r\nyear, when the pig was killed, a ham was put away “in case of a\r\nfuneral” and was not touched till the next pig was killed and another\r\nham was put in readiness; and from thence it comes that “màngier la\r\ntchesse à quiqu’un”--“to eat a person’s ham”--is proverbially used in\r\nthe sense of attending his funeral. The first glass of wine is drunk in\r\nsilence to the memory of the departed, whose good qualities are then\r\ndilated upon, but the conversation soon becomes general, and it not\r\nunfrequently happens that more liquor is imbibed than is altogether\r\ngood for the guests. In fact the mourners had generally to be conveyed\r\nhome in carts.[49]\r\n\r\nFrom ancient wills it seems that money was sometimes left for the\r\npurpose of clothing a certain number of poor, and from the ordinances\r\nof the Royal Court prohibiting begging at funerals, or even the\r\nvoluntary giving of alms on these occasions, it is not improbable that\r\nthe custom of distributing doles was, at one time, almost general.\r\nThere is no trace of it in the present day.\r\n\r\nTill within the last few years it was almost an universal custom, even\r\namong the dissenters, for the members of a household in which a death\r\nhad occurred, to attend their parish church in a body on the first or\r\nsecond Sunday after the funeral, and the custom is still kept up to\r\na certain extent. If they are regular frequenters of the church they\r\noccupy their usual seats, if not, they are placed, if possible, in some\r\nconspicuous part of the building, where they remain seated during the\r\nentire service, not rising even during those portions of the service\r\nin which standing is prescribed by the rubric. This is called “taking\r\nmourning,” in French “prendre le deuil.” Widows remain seated in church\r\nduring the whole of the first year of their widowhood.\r\n\r\n[47] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Mr. Allen told me (1896) that attending a short\r\ntime ago at a funeral in the Mount Durand, the corpse was to be carried\r\nto Trinity Church, to which of course the shortest route was _down_ the\r\nhill, but the widow of the deceased remonstrated so vigorously, saying\r\nthat she could not allow anything so unlucky to happen to her husband,\r\nas that he should start for his funeral _down hill_, that, in deference\r\nto her wishes they went _up_ the hill and round by Queen’s-road.\r\n\r\n[48] At funeral feasts it was an ancient custom in Iceland to leave\r\nthe place of the dead man vacant.--See Gould’s “_Curiosities of Olden\r\nTimes_,” p. 84.\r\n\r\n[49] EDITOR’S NOTES.--Unless the forehead of the corpse is touched\r\nafter death the ghost will walk. When you go into a house of mourning\r\nand are shown the corpse you should always lay your hand on its\r\nforehead.--_From Fanny Ingrouille, of the Forest Parish._\r\n\r\nThe same idea prevails in Guernsey which we meet with in Yorkshire\r\nand many of the Eastern Counties of England that, having your pillow\r\nstuffed with pigeons’, doves’, or any _wild_ bird’s feathers will cause\r\nyou to “die hard.”--See _Notes and Queries_, 1st Series, Vol. IV.\r\n\r\nIt is also said that it is unlucky to keep doves in a house, but if\r\nthey are kept in a cage and anyone dies in the house, unless a crape\r\nbow is placed on the top of the cage they will die too.\r\n\r\nThe country people also believe that no one ever dies when the tide is\r\n_rising_. Frequently when talking of a death they will say, “the tide\r\nturned, and took off poor ---- with it.”--_From Fanny Ingrouille and\r\nmany others._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II.\r\n\r\nSuperstitious Belief and Practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPrehistoric Monuments; and their Superstitions.\r\n\r\n    “Of brownyis and of bogillus full is this buke.”\r\n\r\n                                  --_Gawin Douglas._\r\n\r\n    “D’un passé sans mémoire, incertaines reliques\r\n    Mystères d’un vieux monde en mystères écrits.”\r\n\r\n                                    --_Lamartine._\r\n\r\n    “Among those rocks and stones, methinks I see\r\n    More than the heedless impress that belongs\r\n    To lonely Nature’s casual work!

Many of these ancient\r\nmonuments have no doubt disappeared with the clearing of the land and\r\nthe enormous amount of quarrying, and many have doubtless been broken\r\nup into building materials, or converted into fences and gateposts.\r\nBut the names of estates and fields still point out where they once\r\nexisted. Thus we find more than one spot with the appelation of\r\n“Pouquelaye.”[50] “Longue Rocque,” or “Longue Pierre,” and the names\r\nof “Les Camps Dolents,” “Les Rocquettes,” and “Les Tuzés” indicate the\r\nsites of monuments which have long since disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe researches carried on with so much care and intelligence by Mr.\r\nLukis have clearly proved that the Cromlechs were sepulchral; perhaps\r\nthe burial places of whole tribes, or at least of the families of the\r\nchieftains. This does not preclude the popular notion of their having\r\nbeen altars, for it is well known that many pagan nations were in the\r\nhabit of offering sacrifices on the tombs of their dead.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the principal Druidical structures, etc.,\r\nwhich we can identify, with an account of the traditional beliefs\r\nattached to them of their origin, etc.:--\r\n\r\nThe large Cromlech at L’Ancresse called “L’Autel des Vardes.”\r\n\r\nThe smaller Cromlech in the centre of L’Ancresse, with a portion of\r\nanother similar structure to the east of it.\r\n\r\nA small portion of a Cromlech at La Mare ès Mauves, on the eastern base\r\nof the Vardes, almost in front of the target belonging to the Royal\r\nGuernsey Militia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “L’Autel des Vardes” at L’Ancresse.]\r\n\r\n“La Roque Balan.”\r\n\r\n“La Roque qui Sonne” (destroyed).\r\n\r\n“Le Tombeau du Grand Sarrazin,” in the district called Fortcàmp\r\n(destroyed).\r\n\r\n“L’Autel de Déhus,” near above.\r\n\r\nSmall Cromlech at “La Vieille Hougue” (destroyed).\r\n\r\n“Le Trépied” or the “Catioroc.”\r\n\r\n“Menhir” or “Longue Pierre” at Richmond.\r\n\r\n“Creux ès Fées”[51] in the parish of St. Pierre-du-Bois.\r\n\r\n“La Longue Roque” or “Palette ès Fées” at the Paysans.\r\n\r\n“La Roque des Fées” (destroyed).\r\n\r\n“Le Gibet des Fées” (destroyed).\r\n\r\n“La Chaire de St. Bonit” (destroyed).\r\n\r\nIn the Island of Herm there are six or eight mutilated remains of\r\nCromlechs. In Lihou, none are left. In Sark, none are left.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the druidical stones are believed to be the\r\nfavourite haunt of the fairy folk, who live in the ant hills which are\r\nfrequently to be found in their vicinity, and who would not fail to\r\npunish the audacious mortal who might venture to remove them.\r\n\r\n[50] The name of “Pouquelaie” given in various districts of Normandy,\r\nand in the Anglo-Norman Isles to megalithic monuments appears to be\r\ncomposed of two Celtic words, of which the latter, the Breton _lee-h_\r\nor _lêh_ means a flat stone. The former of these words--_pouque_, some\r\netymologists say is derived from a Celtic word meaning, _To kiss_, or\r\n_adore_--and thus “Pouquelaie”--_the stone we adore_; but many others\r\nthink with equal probability that _Pouque_ is derived from the same\r\nroot from whence we get _Puck_, the mad sprite Shakespeare has so well\r\ndescribed in his “Midsummer’s Night’s Dream.” The _pixies_, or Cornish\r\nand Devonshire fairies, and the _Phooka_, or goblin of the Irish, are\r\nevidently of the same family.\r\n\r\n[51] EDITOR’S NOTES.--In _Traditions et Superstitions de la Haute\r\nBretagne_, M. Paul Sebillot, says:--“En général les dolmens sont\r\nappelés _grottes aux fées_, ou _roches aux fées_; c’est en quelque\r\nsorte une désigation générique (p. 5). Les noms font allusion à des\r\nfées, aux lutins, parfois aux saints ou au diable. Comme on le verra\r\ndans les dépositions qui suivent, c’est à ces mêmes personnages que les\r\npaysans attribuent l’érection des Mégalithes (p. 8.), etc.”\r\n\r\nIn _Croyances et Légendes du Centre de la France_, par Laisnel de la\r\nSalle, he says, Tome I., page 100:--“Les fées se plaisent surtout à\r\nerrer parmi les nombreux monuments druidiques … ou se dressent encore\r\nles vieux autels, là sont toujours présentes les vieilles divinités.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“L’AUTEL DES VARDES” AT L’ANCRESSE.\r\n\r\nThis consists of five enormous blocks of granite, laid horizontally on\r\nperpendicular piles, as large as their enormous covering. Around it,\r\nthe remains of a circle of stones, of which the radius is thirty-three\r\nfeet, and the centre of which coincides with the tomb. Mr. Métivier\r\nsays in his “Souvenirs Historiques de Guernesey” that this “Cercle de\r\nla Plaine,” in Norse _Land Kretz_, on this exposed elevation, could not\r\nfail to attract the attention of the Franks, Saxons, and Normans, and\r\nthus gave its name to the surrounding district.\r\n\r\nIn it were found bones, stone hatchets, hammers, skulls, limpet shells,\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps to this latter fact that we must attribute the idea which\r\nis entertained by the peasantry that hidden treasures, when discovered\r\nby a mortal, are transformed in appearance by the demon who guards them\r\ninto worthless shells.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LA ROQUE BALAN.”\r\n\r\n“La Roque Balan” was situated at the Mielles, in the Vale parish.\r\nIt is supposed by some to have taken its name from Baal, Belenus,\r\n(the Sun God), the Apollo of the Gauls, whom the Thuriens, a Grecian\r\ncolony, called _Ballen_, “Lord and King,” and to whom they dedicated\r\na temple at Baïeux. The custom of lighting fires in honour of Bel or\r\nBaal continued in Scotland and Ireland almost to the beginning of this\r\ncentury. In Guernsey, at Midsummer, on the Eve of St. John’s Day, June\r\n24th, the people used to go to this rock and there dance on its summit,\r\nwhich Mr. Métivier describes in 1825 as being quite flat. The refrain\r\nof an old ballad proved this:\r\n\r\n    _“J’iron tous à la St. Jean_\r\n    _Dansaïr à la Roque Balan.”_\r\n\r\nSome people conjecture this rock to be the base of a balancing, or\r\nLogan stone, and others again that it was the site where Dom Mathurin,\r\nPrior of St. Michel, weighed in the _balances_ the commodities of his\r\ntenants. But the most probable supposition is that it was named after\r\nthe _Ballen_ family, former residents of this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nNear this rock stood\r\n\r\n\r\n“LA ROQUE QUI SONNE.”\r\n\r\nThis was the name given by the peasantry to a large stone which\r\nformerly stood on the borders of L’Ancresse, in the Vale parish. There\r\nis no doubt that it formed part of a Cromlech, and it is said that when\r\nstruck it emitted a clear ringing sound. It was looked upon in the\r\nneighbourhood as something supernatural, and great was the astonishment\r\nand consternation of the good people of the Clos du Valle, when Mr.\r\nHocart, of Belval, the proprietor of the field in which it stood,\r\nannounced his intention of breaking it up in order to make doorposts\r\nand lintels for the new house he was on the point of building. In\r\nvain did the neighbours represent that stone was not scarce in the\r\nVale, and that there was no necessity for destroying an object of so\r\nmuch curiosity. No arguments could prevail with him, not even the\r\npredictions of certain grey-headed men, the oracles of the parish, who\r\nassured him that misfortune was sure to follow his sacrilegious act. He\r\nwas one of those obstinate men, who, the more they are spoken to, the\r\nless will they listen to reason, and finally the stone-cutters were set\r\nto work on the stone.\r\n\r\nBut now a circumstance occurred which would have moved any man less\r\ndetermined than Hocart from his purpose. Every stroke of the hammer\r\non the stone was heard as distinctly at the Church of St. Michel du\r\nValle, distant nearly a mile, as if the quarrymen were at work in the\r\nvery churchyard itself![52] Orders were nevertheless given to the men\r\nto continue their work. The stone was cut into building materials, and\r\nthe new house was rapidly approaching completion without accident or\r\nstoppage. Hocart laughed at the predictions of the old men, who had\r\nforetold all sorts of disasters.\r\n\r\nAt last the day arrived when the carpenters were to quit the house. Two\r\nservant maids,--or, as others have it, a servant man and a maid,--were\r\nsent at an early hour to assist in cleaning and putting things to\r\nrights for the reception of the family, but at eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning a fire broke out in the house, and its progress was so rapid\r\nthat the poor servants had not time to save themselves, but perished in\r\nthe flames. Before noon the house was one heap of smoking ruins, but it\r\ncould never be discovered how the fire had originated.\r\n\r\nHocart’s misfortunes, however, were not at an end. Some part of the\r\nrock had been cut into paving stones for the English market, and the\r\nrefuse broken up into small fragments for making and repairing roads.\r\nIn the course of the year the one and the other were embarked for\r\nEngland on board of two vessels in which Hocart had an interest as\r\nshareholder, but, strange to say, both vessels perished at sea.\r\n\r\nHocart himself went to reside in Alderney, but was scarcely settled\r\nthere when a fire broke out and destroyed his new dwelling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Smith Street, A.D. 1870.]\r\n\r\nHe then determined on returning to Guernsey, but when close to land a\r\nportion of the rigging of the vessel on board which he sailed, fell on\r\nhis head, fractured his skull, and he died immediately.[53]\r\n\r\nThere is another instance given of the ill luck which waits on those\r\nwho interfere with the Cromlech and disturb the repose of the mighty\r\ndead[54] in the “Legend of La Haye du Puits,” which is drawn from an\r\nancient chronicle and published in versified form by “M. A. C.,” with\r\nextracts from Mrs. White’s notes. The legend runs thus:--\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry II. of England Geoffrey of Anjou raised a\r\nrebellion against him in Normandy. Not wishing to be a rebel, Sir\r\nRichard of La Haye du Puits, a noble Norman knight, fled from thence\r\nto Guernsey, and landed in Saints’ Bay. He settled in Guernsey and\r\nproceeded to build himself a house, which he named after his Norman\r\nmansion “La Haye du Puits.” Unfortunately for himself, in so doing\r\nhe destroyed an old Cromlech. All the inhabitants told him that he\r\nwould in consequence become cursed, and a settled gloom descended upon\r\nhim. Nothing could cheer him; he felt he was a doomed man. At last he\r\nthought that perhaps by resigning the house and dedicating it to God he\r\nmight avert his fate. So he gave it to the Church, and turned it into\r\na nunnery, making it a condition that the abbess and nuns should daily\r\npray that the curse might be removed from him.\r\n\r\nHe then set sail from Rocquaine Bay, for France, the rebellion being\r\nover, and his wife, Matilda, awaiting him in their old home. But on\r\nhis way his ship was captured by Moorish pirates, and he was taken\r\nas prisoner to Barbary. When there, his handsome presence made so\r\nmuch impression on the governor’s wife that she entreated he might be\r\nallowed to guard the tower where she resided with her maidens.\r\n\r\nWhat was his astonishment when one of them looked out, and, recognising\r\na fellow countryman, called out and told him that she was Adèle,\r\ndaughter of his old friend and neighbour, Ranulph. She also had been\r\ntaken prisoner by these pirates, by whom her father had been killed;\r\nshe implored him to effect her escape. She handed him her jewels, and\r\nwith these he bribed their jailers, and he, she, and her nurse Alice,\r\nall managed to escape to France. He took her to the Norman “Haye du\r\nPuits,” and there, according to the old chronicle, he found his wife,\r\nMatilda, and all “in a right prosperous and flourishing condition.”\r\nFrom there Adèle married a Hugh d’Estaile, a young Norman knight, high\r\nin the favour of King Henry.\r\n\r\nBut the spirits of the Cromlech were not yet appeased. Sir Richard\r\ncould not shake off the brooding care and haunting night-mares which\r\nalways oppressed him, though he tried to propitiate heaven by building\r\ntwo churches in Normandy, “St. Marie du Parc,” and “St. Michel du\r\nBosq,” “for the deliverance of his soul,” but it was of no avail, and\r\nhe died, a wretched and broken-down man. Even the nuns in the Convent\r\nof the Haye du Puits were so harassed and distressed, that finally\r\nthey decided to leave it; it is said that one unquiet nun haunts the\r\nhouse to this day. Since then it has passed through many hands, but\r\ntradition says that for many years it never brought good fortune to its\r\npossessors.\r\n\r\n[52] I have heard that the strokes of the hammer were heard in the town\r\nwhen La Roque qui Sonne was broken up. A spot was shewn me some years\r\nsince as the site where this stone stood. I cannot exactly define the\r\nspot, but know it was to the east of the Vale Parochial School.--_From\r\nJohn de Garis, Esq., of Les Rouvets._\r\n\r\n[53] From the late Mr. Thomas Hocart, of Marshfield, nephew of the\r\nHocart to whom these events occurred.\r\n\r\n[54] EDITOR’S NOTE.--In _Traditions et Superstitions de la Haute\r\nBretagne_, Vol. I., p. 32, M. Sebillot says: “En beaucoup d’endroits,\r\non pense qu’il est dangereux de détruire les pierres druidiques,\r\nparceque les esprits qui les ont construits ne manqueraient pas de se\r\nvenger.” See also “Amélie Rosquet, p. 186 of _La Normandie Romanesque_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“LE TOMBEAU DU GRAND SARRAZIN.”\r\n\r\nIn the district called Le Tort Càmp, near Paradis, was one of the\r\nprincipal Cromlechs at the Vale, now quarried away, called “L’Autel,”\r\nor “Le Tombeau du Grand Sarrazin.” Who “Le Grand Sarrazin” was, it\r\nis now impossible to say. He is also called Le Grand Geffroi, and\r\nhis castle--from whence the name “Le Castel”--stood where the Church\r\nof Ste. Marie-du-Castel now stands. He must have been one of those\r\npiratical sea kings, who, under the various appellations of Angles,\r\nSaxons, Danes, and Northmen or Normans, issued from the countries\r\nbordering on the North Sea and the Baltic, and invaded the more\r\nfavoured regions of Britain and Gaul. The name “Geffroy,” (_Gudfrid_,\r\nor “la paix de Dieu”) seems to confirm this tradition. As to the term\r\n“Sarrazin”--Saracen, although originally given to the Mahometans\r\nwho invaded the southern countries of Europe, it came to be applied\r\nindifferently to all marauding bands; and Wace, the poet and historian,\r\na native of Jersey, who lived and wrote in the reign of Henry II., in\r\nspeaking of the descent of the Northmen on these islands, calls them\r\nexpressly “La Gent Sarrazine.” Among the many Geoffreys of the North\r\nwhom history celebrates, there is one, a son of King Regnar, who may be\r\nthe one celebrated in our local traditions. Charles the Bald yielded to\r\nhim “a county on the Sequanic shore.”\r\n\r\nAt that time the coast of Gaul was divided into three sea-borders,\r\nnamely, the Flemish, the Aquitanian, and the Sequanic, called\r\n“Sequanicum littus” by Paul Warnefrid, who places one of these islands\r\nnear it.\r\n\r\nThat his castle stood at one time on the site of the present church, is\r\nconfirmed by the discoveries which have frequently been made in digging\r\ngraves, of considerable masses of solid masonry, which appear to be the\r\nfoundations of former outworks of the fortress. It is even possible\r\nthat some portions of the walls of the church may be the remains of the\r\nearlier building. There are also in the neighbourhood “Le Fief Geffroi”\r\nand “Le Camp Geffroi.”[55]\r\n\r\n[55] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Referring to “Le Grand Sarrazin,” Dupont says\r\nin his _Histoire du Cotentin et ses Iles_, Vol I., p. 140-41:--“Le\r\npersonnage ainsi désigné ne peut être que l’un de ces avanturiers\r\nNorses qui furent souvent confondus avec les Sarrazins. Wace lui-même\r\nappelle les envahisseurs des îles les “_gent Sarrazine_.” Le “Grand\r\nGeffroi” était, selon toute vrai semblance le célèbre Jarl _Godefrid_\r\nou _Godefroy_ fils d’Hériald. Son père, après avoir détruit l’eglise\r\ndu Mont Saint Michel fut assassiné par les comtes francs, et pour le\r\nvenger, il se jeta sur la Frise et sur la Neustrie. Après trois ans de\r\nravage il se fit, en 850, concéder par Charles-le-Chauve une certaine\r\nétendue de terre, que le savant danois Suhne conjecture avoir été\r\nsituée dans nôtre province. L’histoire générale, on le voit, confirme\r\ndonc singulièrement la tradition conservée à Guernesey, en lui donnant\r\nune date précise; et cette tradition elle-même rend à peu près certain\r\nle fait fort intéressant, et si souvent obscur, d’un établissement\r\npermament des Normands en Neustrie, plus d’un demi-siècle avant sa\r\nprise en possession par Rolle; elle prouve, enfin, le rôle important\r\nque les îles du Contentin remplirent durant ces époques calamiteuses.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“L’AUTEL DE DÉHUS.”\r\n\r\nQuite close to where “Le Tombeau du Grand Sarrazin” was situated,\r\nclose to the Pointe au Norman, in the environs of Paradis,[56] in the\r\nVale parish, and bordering on the Hougues d’Enfer, is the Pouquelêh de\r\nDéhus. This spot, as well as some fields in the Castel parish called\r\n“Les Déhusets” or “Les Tuzets,” are supposed to be favourite resorts of\r\nthe fairies.\r\n\r\nM. de Villemarque, in his _Barzas-Breiz_, the work so well known to\r\nfolk-lorists, tells us that the Bretons gave the imps or goblins,\r\nwhom they call pigmies, amongst others the name of “Duz,” diminutive\r\n“Duzik,” a name they bore in the time of St. Augustine; and he also\r\nsays that they, like fairies, inhabit Dolmens. Mr. Métivier explains\r\nthe name “Déhus” or “Dhuss” as the “God of the Dead, and of Riches,”\r\nthe _Dis_ of the Gauls in the time of Cæsar, _Théos_ in Greek, _Deus_\r\nin Latin--le Dus, or le Duc. He says “Our _Dehussets_ are nothing but\r\n_Dhus i gou_, spirits of the dead and goblins of the deep.”\r\n\r\nThe exterior circle measures sixty feet in diameter, by forty in\r\nlength, and the direction is from east to west. The enormous block\r\nof granite which serves as a roof to the western chamber is the most\r\nstriking part of it. At the extremity of this chamber is a cell, the\r\nouter compartment eleven feet in length by nine in width. The adjoining\r\none is of the same length. On the northern side a singular appendix in\r\nthe form of a side chamber joins the two smaller rooms just described.\r\nThere has also been discovered a fifth cell, the roof of which was\r\nformed of granite resting on three or four pillars, at the corner of\r\nthe northern chamber. But the most interesting discovery of all was\r\nthat of two kneeling skeletons, side by side, but placed in opposite\r\npositions, that is to say, one looking towards the north, the other\r\ntowards the south. Besides these, bones of persons of both sexes and\r\nall ages, a stone hatchet, some pottery and limpet shells, were also\r\nfound inside this place of sepulchre. It was long supposed to be\r\nhaunted by fairies, imps, and ghosts, perhaps the same spirits who,\r\nin the haunted field of “Les Tuzés,” are reported to have removed the\r\nfoundations of the intended Parish Church of the Castel to its present\r\nsite. There is also a “Le Déhuzel” in the neighbourhood of the Celtic\r\nremains near L’Erée.\r\n\r\n[56] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Près de Louvigné-du-Désert, est un groupe de dix\r\nà douze blocs gigantiques de granite. On a aussi donné le nom de “Rue\r\nde _Paradis_, du _Purgatoire_, et de _l’Enfer_” aux intervalles étroits\r\nqui séparent ces énormes blocs.--_Traditions de la Haute Bretagne_, par\r\nPaul Sebillot, T. I., p. 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LE TRÉPIED, OR THE CATIOROC.”\r\n\r\nThis Cromlech is on a rocky promontory, south-west of Perelle Bay,\r\nin the beautiful parish of St. Saviour’s. The derivation of its name,\r\n“Castiau-Roc”--as it is properly--is from the “_Castelh Carreg_”\r\n“Castle Rock” of the Gauls. As one approaches it one is struck by the\r\nvestiges of Cromlechs with their circles, and bits of “Longues Roques.”\r\nIn olden days, before so much of the surroundings were quarried away,\r\nthis must have been only one among many other conspicuous objects down\r\nthere. The names “La Roque Fendue,” “La Roque au Tonnerre,” “Plateau\r\nès Roques,” “La Pièche des Grandes Roques du Castiau-Roc,” which are\r\nmentioned in various “Livres de Perquages,” are all that remain of\r\nthese ancient remains. Much to be regretted is the disappearance of the\r\n“Portes du Castiau-Roc,” which might perhaps have helped us to define\r\nwith some exactitude where this problematic castle once stood, and\r\nperhaps identify it with the fortified mounts of the Celts and Irish.\r\nIt is noted in our island annals for being the midnight haunt of our\r\nwitches and wizards. In the trials for witchcraft held under Amias de\r\nCarteret in the beginning of the seventeenth century, it was there that\r\nhis trembling victims confessed to having come and danced on Friday\r\nnights, in honour of the gigantic cat or goat with black fur, called\r\n“Baal-Bérith” or “Barberi,” nowadays “Lucifer.” Near this rock was the\r\n“Chapel of the Holy Virgin” on Lihou Island, now in ruins, and it is\r\nsaid that the witches even defied the influence of “the Star of the\r\nSea,” shouting in chorus while they danced,\r\n\r\n    _“Qué, hou, hou,_\r\n    _Marie Lihou.”_\r\n\r\nThis monument is like the “Tables en Trépied,” and analogous to the\r\n“Lhêch y Drybedh” of the county of Pembroke, in Wales. There were\r\naltars in this form and of this description in almost every canton of\r\nthe island. One, near the Chapel of St. George, is quite destroyed, and\r\nthere are now no traces left of another between the Haye-du-Puits, and\r\nthe Villocq. In the environs of the Castiau-Roc bones and arms have\r\nbeen found.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\n“LE CREUX ES FAÏES.”\r\n\r\nThis Cromlech is situated on the Houmet Nicolle at the point of L’Erée,\r\n(so called from the branch of the sea, _Eiré_, which separates it from\r\nthe islet of Notre Dame de Lihou). This island, which once had upon it\r\na chapel and a priory dedicated to “Notre Dame de la Roche,” was always\r\nconsidered so sacred a spot that even to-day the fishermen salute it in\r\npassing.\r\n\r\nThis Creux is a Dolmen of the nature of those which are called in\r\nFrance “allées couvertes,” perfectly well preserved, and partly covered\r\nwith earth. The researches which have been made in these ancient\r\nmonuments of antiquity prove them to have been places of sepulchre.\r\nThis one consists of a chamber seven feet high, and covered with a roof\r\nof two blocks of granite, each fifteen feet long and ten broad. The\r\nentrance faces east, and is only two feet eight inches wide, but soon\r\nenlarges, and the interior is almost uniformly eleven feet wide.\r\n\r\nThis is, as its name would lead one to suppose, a favourite haunt of\r\nthe fairies, or perhaps, to speak more correctly, their usual dwelling\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt is related that a man who happened to be lying on the grass near\r\nit, heard a voice within calling out: “_La païlle, la païlle, le fouar\r\nest caûd_.” (The shovel,[58] the oven is hot). To which the answer was\r\nimmediately returned: “_Bon! J’airon de la gâche bientôt_.” (Good! We\r\nshall have some cake presently.)\r\n\r\nAnother version from Mrs. Savidan is that some men were ploughing in\r\na field belonging to Mr. Le Cheminant, just below the Cromlech, when\r\nthe voice was heard saying “_La paille_,” _etc._ One of them answered,\r\n“_Bon! J’airon de la gâche_,” and almost immediately afterwards a cake,\r\nquite hot, fell into one of the furrows. One of the men immediately\r\nran forward and seized it, exclaiming that he would have a piece to\r\ntake home to his wife, but on stooping to take it up he received such a\r\nbuffet on the head as stretched him at full length on the ground. It is\r\nfrom here that the fairies issue on the night of the full moon to dance\r\non Mont Saint till daybreak.[59]\r\n\r\n[57] See _Archæological Journal_, Vol. I., p. 202, for an engraving of\r\nthis Castiau-Roc.\r\n\r\n[58] EDITOR’S NOTE.--“La païlle à four, is, in the country, usually a\r\nwooden shovel with a long handle. It is used for putting things in the\r\noven when hot, and taking them out when baked.”\r\n\r\n[59] EDITOR’S NOTE.--This is still believed, for in 1896, when my aunt,\r\nMrs. Curtis, bought some land on Mont Saint, and built a house there,\r\nthe country people told her that it was very unlucky to go there and\r\ndisturb the fairy people in the spot where they dance.\r\n\r\nMy cousin, Miss Le Pelley, writes in 1896 from St. Pierre-du-Bois,\r\nsaying “The people still believe the Creux des Fées and ‘Le Trepied’ to\r\nhave been the fairies’ houses, and as proof one woman told me that when\r\nthey dug down they found all kinds of pots and pans and china things.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“LA LONGUE ROQUE” OR “PALETTE ES FAÏES.”\r\n\r\nIn a field in the parish of St. Pierre-du-Bois, on the way to L’Erée\r\nand in the neighbourhood of the secluded valley of St. Brioc and the\r\nwoody nook in which the ancient chapel dedicated to that Saint once\r\nstood, stands one of those Celtic monuments, many of which are still\r\nto be seen in Brittany and Cornwall, and which are known in those\r\ncountries by the name of “Menhir.” This word in the Breton tongue, and\r\nin its cognate dialect the ancient language of Cornwall, signifies\r\n“long stone.” The name which similar monuments bear in Normandy and\r\nBrittany in this island is “longue pierre” or “longue roque,” a literal\r\ntranslation of the Celtic name. There must have been at one time many\r\n“longues roques” in Guernsey. Another still stands in a field near the\r\nroad at Richmond. There was in 1581 “la pièche de la longue pierre, la\r\npierre séante dedans,”--a part of the Fief ès Cherfs, at the Castel.\r\nThere was also “la Roque Séante dans le courtil de la Hougue au Comte,”\r\nand the “Roque-à-Bœuf dans le Courtil au Sucq du chemin de l’église,”\r\nnear St. George, but these latter have long since disappeared, though a\r\nhouse near the field still bears the name.\r\n\r\nAntiquaries are very much divided in opinion as to the original\r\ndestination of these singular masses of rock; it is not wonderful that\r\nthey should prove a puzzle and a source of wonder to the unlettered\r\npeasantry. How were such immense blocks placed upright, and for what\r\npurpose? The agency of supernatural beings is an easy answer to the\r\nquestion, and some such cause is usually assigned for their origin by\r\nthe tradition of the country. Sometimes they are the work of fairies,\r\nsometimes of giants and magicians, and sometimes they are said to be\r\nmortals changed into stone by an offended deity for some sacrilegious\r\nact, or heroes petrified as a lasting testimony of their exploits.\r\n\r\nThe Menhir at St. Peter’s-in-the-Wood stands in a field at Les\r\nPaysans, so called from the name of the extinct family who once\r\npossessed it. It is over ten feet in height, and about three feet\r\nwide, and the people’s name for it, “Palette ès faïes”--the fairies’\r\nbattledore,--describes it exactly. Tradition says that in former days\r\na man who was returning homewards at a very late hour of the night,\r\nor who had risen before the lark to visit his nets in Rocquaine Bay,\r\nwas astonished at meeting a woman of very diminutive stature coming up\r\nthe hill from the sea-shore. She was knitting, while carrying in her\r\napron something with as much care and tenderness as if it had been a\r\nclutch of eggs, or a newly-born babe. The man’s curiosity was excited,\r\nand he determined to watch the little woman. He therefore concealed\r\nhimself behind a hedge and followed her movements. At last the woman\r\nstopped, and great was the astonishment of the countryman when he saw\r\nher produce a mass of stone of at least fifteen feet in length, and\r\nstick it upright in the midst of the field, with as much ease as if she\r\nwere merely sticking a pin into a pincushion. He then comprehended that\r\nthe unknown female could be no other than a denizen of fairy-land, but\r\nwhat could be her object in erecting such a monument? The people are at\r\na loss in finding an answer to this question. Some say the stone was\r\nplaced there by the fairies to serve them as a mark when they played at\r\nball.[60]\r\n\r\nThere is another story told to account for “La Palette ès Faïes.” It\r\nis well known that Rocquaine and its environs was the abode _par\r\nexcellence_ of the fairy folk, and in the valley of St. Brioc two of\r\nthese fairies once lived. Whether they were father and son, or what\r\nother relationship existed between them, is not known, but among the\r\nhuman inhabitants of the valley they went by the names of Le Grand\r\nColin and Le Petit Colin. They were fond of sports, and occasionally\r\namused themselves with a game of ball on the open and tolerably level\r\nfields of Les Paysans. On one occasion they had placed their boundary\r\nmarks, and had played some rounds, when Le Grand Colin struck the ball\r\nwith such force that it bounded off quite out of sight. Le Petit Colin,\r\nwhose turn it was to play, called out to his companion, with some\r\ndegree of ill-humour, that the ball had disappeared beyond the bounds,\r\non which Le Grand Colin struck his bat with force into the ground, and\r\nsaid he would play no more. The bat still remains in the centre of the\r\nfield, and the ball--an enormous spherical boulder--is pointed out on\r\nthe sea-shore near Les Pezeries, fully a mile and a half off.[61]\r\n\r\n[60] From Miss Lane, afterwards Mrs. Lane-Clarke.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--See in _Traditions et Superstitions de la Haute\r\nBretagne_ par Paul Sebillot, Tome I., p. 10 and 11, etc.:--“Les Roches\r\naux Fées qui sont vers Saint-Didier et Marpiré (Ille-et-Vilaine) ont\r\nété elevées par les Fées; elles prenaient les plus grosses pierres du\r\npays et les apportaient dans leurs tabliers.… Près du bois du Rocher\r\nen Pleudihan, sur la route de Dinan à Dol, est un dolmen que les\r\nfées, disent les gens du pays, ont apporté dant leurs ‘devantières’\r\n(tabliers).”\r\n\r\n[61] From William Le Poidevin.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.--These two traditions are still told by the country\r\npeople in 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LA ROQUE DES FAÏES.”\r\n\r\nA little beyond the village called “Le Bourg de la Forêt” there stood\r\nformerly an upright stone, which was known by the name of “La Roque des\r\nFaïes,”--the fairies’ stone. It was unfortunately destroyed when the\r\nroad was improved. The people in the neighbourhood were rather shy of\r\npassing it at night, as it was believed that the place was haunted, and\r\nthat fairies held their nightly revels there. Like other stones of a\r\nsimilar nature it was said to have been placed there by the elves to\r\nserve as a goal or mark in their games of ball or bowls; and, according\r\nto some accounts, the “Longue Roque” at “Les Paysans” in the adjoining\r\nparish of St. Pierre-du-Bois was the other boundary. It is not at all\r\nunlikely that these stones may really have served for such a purpose\r\nin days of yore, if not for the fairy-folk, at least for mortals. What\r\nis more probable than that the peasantry of the islands should have\r\nhad the same games as existed until lately in Cornwall under the name\r\nof “hurling,” and in Brittany under the name of “La Soule,” as well as\r\nelsewhere, in which the young men of the neighbouring districts met\r\nat certain seasons on the confines of their respective parishes, and\r\ncontended which should first bear a ball to a spot previously fixed on\r\nas the goal in each?\r\n\r\nIt is said that the spot where the stone in question stood was\r\noriginally fixed on as the site of the Parish Church of the Forest; but\r\nthat, after all the materials had been got together for the purpose of\r\nlaying the foundations of the sacred edifice they were removed in the\r\nshort space of one night by the fairies to the place where the church\r\nnow stands, the little people thus resenting the intrusion on their\r\ndomain.[62]\r\n\r\n[62] From Mrs. Richard Murton, born Caroline Le Tullier.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LE GIBET DES FAÏES.”\r\n\r\nA Celtic monument of the kind commonly known to antiquaries by the\r\nname of “trilethon” is said to have existed formerly on the Common\r\nat L’Ancresse, near La Hougue Patris. It is described by old people\r\nwho remember to have seen it in their youth as consisting of three\r\nupright stones or props, supporting a fourth, overhanging the others.\r\nIt was known by the name of “Le Gibet des Fâïes.” Near it was a\r\nfountain called “La Fontaine des Fâïes,” the water of which, although\r\nnot plentiful, was never known to fail entirely, even in the very\r\ndriest seasons; it is said to have been below the surface in a kind\r\nof artificial cave formed by huge blocks of stone, and entered by two\r\nopenings on different sides. The proprietor of the land many years ago\r\nbroke up the stones for building purposes and converted the fountain\r\ninto a well.[63]\r\n\r\n[63] EDITOR’S NOTE. STONE ON LA MOYE ESTATE.\r\n\r\nThey are still firmly convinced in the Vale parish of the sanctity of\r\nDruidical stones, and various stones, which are not generally regarded\r\nas being Druidical remains, were pointed out to me by Miss Falla,\r\n(whose ancestors for hundreds of years have been landed proprietors\r\nat the Vale), as being sacred, and, she added, that her father and\r\ngrandfathers would have considered it sacrilege to touch them.\r\n\r\nSuch are the large upright stones in the field Le Courtil-ès-Arbres,\r\nimmediately opposite the house called Sohier, which is owned by Miss\r\nFalla, who said that her uncle, at one time, wished to quarry in that\r\nfield, but was deterred by his neighbours, who pointed out to him\r\nthe folly and impiety of meddling with “les pierres saintes.” Beyond\r\nthe Ville-ès-Pies is a field containing large stones; it has been\r\nextensively quarried, but the stones have been religiously preserved,\r\nand are seen on an isolated hillock in the field, their height being\r\nintensified by the deep quarries round them.\r\n\r\nThe cottage which is built on the remains of St. Magloire’s Chapel, is\r\nsupposed to be built on its own old foundation stone, as the workmen\r\nwhen building the cottage, thought it would be sacrilege to interfere\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThere is a field called La Houmière, opposite an estate called La Moye,\r\nwhich also belonged to the Fallas for many generations, and is now in\r\nthe possession of Miss Falla’s brother. In this field is one solitary\r\nupright stone, and to this stone a most extraordinary superstition is\r\nattached. It is a grass field and is grown in hay, but for generations\r\nthe mowers have always been forbidden to cut the hay _round_ and _past_\r\nthe stone till all the other hay has been cut and carted, for if they\r\ndo, however fine the weather may previously have been, it invariably\r\nbrings on a storm of wind and rain! So, taught by experience, it has\r\nalways been the rule, and still continues, that, though the outer edge\r\nof the field may be cut, the stone itself and its “entourage” are not\r\nto be touched till the very last, for fear of bringing on the rain in\r\nthe middle of the hay making.--(_From Miss Falla_).\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD FIGURES IN THE CHURCHYARDS OF ST. MARTIN’S AND THE CASTEL.\r\n\r\nIn the course of some works recently (1878) undertaken for reseating\r\nthe Parish Church of Ste. Marie-du-Castel, two discoveries were made,\r\nwhich are of great interest. One is a sort of oven or furnace, which\r\nwas found below the surface of the floor of the church, and immediately\r\nunder the apex of the westernmost arch, between the nave and the south\r\naisle. It lies north and south, extending into the nave; but what\r\nappears to have been the mouth does not reach southward beyond the\r\narch, no part of it being in the south aisle. If this aisle is really\r\na more recent addition to the original building, the mouth of the\r\nfurnace may have been at one time in an outer wall. The whole length\r\nis eight feet, the width two feet three inches, and the depth three\r\nfeet six inches. The sides are roughly masoned and the northern end\r\nslightly rounded. A length of about three feet at the south end is\r\narched over with stones, which have evidently been subjected to great\r\nheat. This part is immediately under the arch between the nave and\r\nthe south aisle. The remaining five feet of the excavation retain no\r\ntraces whatever of an arch, and are situated entirely in the nave.\r\nThe floor of the excavation is of hard compact gravel, covered with\r\nashes, among which were several pieces of charcoal and a few small\r\nfragments of brass, perhaps bell-metal. The northern end seems to have\r\nbeen used as a sort of ossuary, into which the bones dug up in making\r\nfresh interments in the church were thrown pell-mell, the remains of no\r\nless than nine skulls, mingled with other osseous remains, having been\r\nfound here. These bore no marks of fire, from which we may conclude\r\nthat the place had ceased to be used as an oven or furnace when they\r\nwere deposited there. I had forgotten to mention that at the south\r\nend of the excavation was found a tile of about one and a-half inches\r\nin thickness, twelve inches in length, and nine inches in width, with\r\na notch in it for the fingers, such as we see in the sliding lid of\r\na box. A few fragments of moulded tiles were found mingled with the\r\nearth, which the architect believed to be Roman. With the exception of\r\na few coins, no other Roman remains have ever been found in Guernsey.\r\nThe nave of the church and the westernmost bay of the aisle had, in\r\nolden days, been walled off from the rest of the building, and served\r\nas a sort of vestibule and place where the cannons and other military\r\nstores belonging to the Militia or trained bands of the parish were\r\nkept. Perhaps the furnace may have been used for casting balls, of\r\nwhich one at least has been found in the building. Some think it may\r\nhave been used for the casting of a bell, but the bells at present in\r\nthe tower throw no light on the subject, having been re-cast in England\r\nabout the beginning of the nineteenth century. There is no appearance\r\nof any chimney or flue leading from the furnace ever having existed,\r\nand the reason of its position within the church, and the use to which\r\nit was put, must, we fear, ever remain an enigma.\r\n\r\nAfter this long digression we will go on to the other discovery made at\r\nthe same time; which presents another puzzle equally unsolved.\r\n\r\nJust within the chancel, at about an equal distance from the north\r\nand south walls, about a foot below the surface, was found a mass of\r\ngranite, lying east and west, and turned over on its left side. It has\r\nall the appearance of a natural boulder somewhat fashioned by art, and\r\ncannot be described better than by saying that it is in shape like a\r\nmummy case, the back being rounded and slightly curved and the front\r\nnearly flat, with the exception of the upper portion of the figure,\r\nwhich indicates that it was intended to represent a female. The total\r\nlength is six feet six inches, the width across the shoulders two feet\r\nthree inches, and the portion corresponding with the head one foot\r\nthree inches from the top of the forehead to the shoulders. It tapers\r\nslightly towards the foot. On each side of the head, extending from\r\nthe forehead to the breast, are two ridges raised above the surface of\r\nthe stone, which may have been intended to represent either a veil or\r\ntresses of hair. There are no traces of any features remaining, but\r\nwhat should be the face bears evident marks of having been subjected to\r\nthe action of a hammer or chisel, as also does the right breast.\r\n\r\nThe stone is altogether too rude and mis-shapen to warrant the\r\nsupposition that it can have been intended to cover a grave, although\r\nits place in the chancel, and its lying with its head to the west,\r\nmay appear to favour this idea; but what renders the discovery of\r\nthis stone more interesting and gives rise to conjecture, is the fact\r\nthat in the churchyard of St. Martin-de-la-Beilleuse another stone of\r\nabout the same size, precisely similar in outline, but in a far better\r\nstate of preservation, exists in the form of a gatepost. In this last\r\nthe features, very coarsely sculptured, and only slightly raised on a\r\nflat surface, are distinctly visible; a row of small knobs, intended\r\neither for curls or a chaplet encircles the forehead, and a sort of\r\ndrapery in regular folds radiates from the chin to the shoulders and\r\nbreasts, which are uncovered, leaving no doubt that in this case, as\r\nin the stone found in the Church of Ste. Marie-du-Castel, a female\r\nfigure was intended to be represented. A confused idea exists among\r\nthe parishioners of St. Martin’s that the stone in their churchyard\r\nwas once an idol; and it is not many years ago that a puritanical\r\nchurchwarden was with difficulty dissuaded from having it broken up,\r\nlest it should once more become an object of adoration. In fact the\r\nstone was broken in half by his orders, and had to be cemented together\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. Martin’s is called St. Martin-de-la-Bellouse or\r\nBeilleuse, a name which an adjoining property bears to this day. The\r\nmeaning of this word “Bellouse” or “Beilleuse” is unknown; but if,\r\nas some have asserted, the early inhabitants of the British Isles\r\nworshipped a deity of the name of Bel, it is not impossible that there\r\nmay have been some female divinity, with a name derived from the same\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly somewhat remarkable that two stones, so very similar\r\nin character, should exist in connection with two churches in the same\r\nisland, and that one of them should have been found in so singular a\r\nposition. One is tempted to believe that both churches may have been\r\nbuilt on spots which had previously been set apart as places of heathen\r\nworship, and that in the case of Ste. Marie-du-Castel the idol had been\r\ndefaced and buried in the earth to put a stop to the adoration paid to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that up to the end of the seventeenth century the\r\ninhabitants of a district in the Department du Morbihan, in Brittany,\r\nadored with superstitious and obscene rites a rude stone image commonly\r\nknown as “La Vénus de Quinipilly,” and which was certainly not a\r\nChristian image. May not the stones here described have served also as\r\nobjects of worship? The substitution of the Blessed Virgin for a female\r\ndivinity is what one may reasonably suppose to have taken place, and\r\nthe continuance of superstitious practices in connection with the idol\r\nmay have led to its defacement and concealment below the floor of the\r\nsacred edifice.[64]\r\n\r\n[64] The Antiquarian Society. Proceedings 1879.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nThis old figure is still regarded with peculiar affection by the people\r\nof St. Martin’s. “_La Gran’mère du Chimquière_,”--“the Grandmother of\r\nthe Churchyard,”--they call it, though I have heard one or two very old\r\npeople call it “St. Martin,” evidently regardless of sex, regarding it\r\nas the patron saint of the parish.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly superstitious reverence used to be paid to it to\r\nwithin comparatively recent times, which probably accounts for the\r\nchurchwarden wishing to have it removed. An old Miss Fallaize, aged\r\neighty, told me that when she was a child the “old people” had told\r\nher that it was “lucky” to place a little offering of fruit, flowers,\r\nor even to spill a little drop of spirits in front of it, for it was\r\nholy--“c’était une pierre sainte” as she expressed it; and an old man\r\nnamed Tourtel, well over eighty, said that when he was a boy it was\r\nfeared--“on la craignait” much more than they do now.\r\n\r\nThere is a stone face, very much the same type as that of this figure,\r\nover the door of a house at the Villette. It is a house in the district\r\ncalled “La Marette,” and belongs to some old Miss Olliviers. They can\r\noffer no explanation to account for its presence, but said that the\r\nhouse was covered with creepers, and it was only when some myrtle which\r\ncovered it was blown down in a gale that it was discovered by their\r\nfather to be there. Of course it may have belonged to some other old\r\nidol which was broken up, and afterwards used for building purposes,\r\nbut no tradition lingers to account for it in any way.\r\n\r\nThe earliest account of the Guernsey Cromlechs was contributed to\r\n_Archæologia_, Vol. XVIII, p. 254, by Joshua Gosselin, Esq., as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    “AN ACCOUNT OF SOME DRUIDICAL REMAINS IN THE ISLAND OF\r\n    GUERNSEY, BY JOSHUA GOSSELIN, ESQ., IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO\r\n    THE RIGHT HON. SIR JOSEPH BANKS, BART., K.B., P.R.S., F.S.A.\r\n\r\n                                     “Guernsey, November 9th, 1811.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR SIR,--A small temporary redoubt was constructed some\r\n    few years back, on a height near the shore, on the left of\r\n    L’Ancresse Bay, three miles from the town in this island. The\r\n    ground on which this redoubt stood, being composed of a sandy\r\n    turf, was by degrees levelled by the wind, and the edges of\r\n    some stones were thereby discovered, which, upon inspection, I\r\n    immediately knew to belong to a Cromlech or Druidical Temple.\r\n    I send you a drawing of this Temple (plate 18) as it appeared\r\n    after the sand, which had covered it to the depth of three or\r\n    four feet, was removed.… The largest of the stones weighs about\r\n    twenty tons. They are supported by stones of the same kind, the\r\n    highest being about six and a-half feet above the ground. The\r\n    temple slopes from west to east; the length of it is thirty-two\r\n    feet, and the greatest width between the supporting stones\r\n    is twelve feet. The soldiers, who were employed in clearing\r\n    away the sand, have assured me that there was a stone which\r\n    closed the entrance into the temple, that some steps led down\r\n    into it, and that there was a pavement of small pebbles, but\r\n    I cannot vouch for the truth of these particulars. When I saw\r\n    the Cromlech there was certainly no vestige of any steps or\r\n    pavement. There was, however, a quantity of human and different\r\n    animal bones found in it, likewise some broken pieces of coarse\r\n    earthen vessels, together with some limpets, such as are on\r\n    the rocks in the bay, a few cockle shells and land snails.\r\n    These last might have been blown into it by the wind, when it\r\n    filled with sand, as there are plenty of them on the adjoining\r\n    common. Some of the fragments of vessels seem to have been\r\n    blackened with fire, and bear the appearance of antiquity; a\r\n    vessel of reddish clay was found whole, which held somewhat\r\n    more than a quart, and was of the shape of a common tea cup. A\r\n    flat circular bone of some fish, of the shape of a disk, and\r\n    about nine inches in diameter, was discovered, together with\r\n    an old fishhook, the former of which was given by the soldiers\r\n    to Sir John Doyle. I was only able to procure for myself some\r\n    of the fragments of broken ware. About eighteen feet distance\r\n    from the foot of the temple there are remains of a circle of\r\n    stones which probably surrounded it; they are placed about a\r\n    foot above the ground, and in general about two feet distant\r\n    from each other. At about forty-two feet from the temple there\r\n    appears to have been another circle of stones of a larger size\r\n    than those of the inner circle, but there are very few of\r\n    them remaining. As this temple stands upon the top of a hill,\r\n    it is the intention of some gentlemen in the island to have so\r\n    much of the sand on each side of it removed, as may render it\r\n    visible to all the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n    “We have three more such temples in this island, but not so\r\n    complete, nor so large, as the one I have just described. One\r\n    of these is situated near Paradis, at the Clos of the Vale, and\r\n    is called ‘La Pierre du Déhus.’ It stands on a rising ground,\r\n    and slopes towards the east-north-east. The stones are of a\r\n    grey granite. The supporting, or upright stones, are two and\r\n    a-half feet above the ground in the inside, and could not be\r\n    more, as the bottom is rocky; they form a parallelogram in the\r\n    inside of twelve feet broad.\r\n\r\n    “Another of these temples is seen at the Catioroc, at St.\r\n    Saviour’s, and the third is situated between L’Ancresse Bay and\r\n    the Valle Church, and is partly concealed by furze.\r\n\r\n    “Some years ago I discovered a very large Logan or rocking\r\n    stone, or a rock at the opposite side of L’Ancresse Bay, which\r\n    could easily be rocked by a child; but within these three\r\n    years it has been entirely destroyed, and no vestige of it\r\n    now remains. An ancient manuscript says that this island was\r\n    originally inhabited by fishermen, who were Pagans, and used\r\n    to place large stones one upon another, near the sea shore,\r\n    on which they performed their sacrifices. The stones of this\r\n    kind, which are now extant, are certainly all situated near\r\n    the sea shore, and this circumstance so far corroborates the\r\n    information given in the manuscript.\r\n\r\n        “I have the honour to be, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n            “Your obliged and very humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                               “JOSHUA GOSSELIN.”\r\n\r\nThis article is illustrated by plates drawn by the author, viz.,\r\n“Temple of L’Ancresse in the Valle Parish, Guernsey,” “Plan of the\r\nsurface of the Temple at L’Ancresse,” “Views of the Temple” called “La\r\nPierre du Déhus,” from the W.S.W. and the E.N.E. “Plan of the surface\r\nof Déhus,” North and South Views of the “Temple at the Catioroc,”\r\nand “The Temple among the Furze between L’Ancresse Bay and the Valle\r\nChurch.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Creux des Fâïes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nNatural Objects and their Superstitions.\r\n\r\n    “Yon old grey stone, protected from the ray\r\n    Of noontide suns.…\r\n    And thou, grey stone, the pensive likeness keep\r\n    Of a dark chamber where the mighty sleep:\r\n    Far more than fancy to the influence bends\r\n    When solitary nature condescends\r\n    To mimic time’s forlorn humanities.”\r\n\r\n                                     --_Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n    “This is the fairy land: oh spight of spights\r\n    We talk with goblins, owls, and elvish sprites.”\r\n\r\n                                    --_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many spots in Guernsey connected with stories and legends\r\nbesides the Druidical remains. The caverns of the Creux des Fées and\r\nCreux Mahié; the various curiously shaped rocks, formed by the hand of\r\nNature, or by the wearing action of the waves; the marks of footprints,\r\nwhether human or diabolical, on various stones; and above all the\r\nsacred fountains, which are still regarded as medicinal, have given\r\nrise to many a tradition, which, though they lose much of their charm\r\nfrom being translated from the quaint Guernsey French in which they are\r\noriginally related, we will here endeavour to render.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE CREUX DES FÉES.\r\n\r\nBetween the bays of Vazon and Cobo is found the peninsula of Houmet,\r\nand here is situated the “Creux des Fées.” It is a small cavern,\r\nworn away by the action of the sea. The granite surrounding its mouth\r\nabounds in particles of mica, which glitter in the sun like streaks\r\nof gold. It can only be approached at low tide, and necessitates much\r\nscrambling over the rocks which are heaped round the mouth of the\r\ngrotto. It is said that by a hole not larger than the mouth of an\r\noven, you gain access to a spacious hall, hollowed out of the rock,\r\nthat in the middle of this hall is a stone table on which are dishes,\r\nplates, drinking cups, and everything necessary for a large feast, all\r\nin stone, and all used by the fairies, but no one has had the courage\r\nto penetrate inside and test the truth of this assertion. It is also\r\nbelieved that beyond it there is a subterranean passage which leads\r\nto the bottom of St. Saviour’s Church, which is distant more than two\r\nmiles. This tradition of a subterranean passage leading to a church at\r\na considerable distance is told of other caverns in Guernsey. Of the\r\nCreux Mahié, where there is also said to be a passage leading to St.\r\nSaviour’s Church, of a large cave in Moulin Huet Bay, which is supposed\r\nto lead to a passage going straight to St. Martin’s Church, and one at\r\nSaints’ Bay, also supposed to lead to St. Saviour’s Church.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--“Le groupe le plus important de demeures de fées que\r\nj’aie rencontré est celui des Houles (l’anglais _hole_, caverne,\r\ngrotte).” … “Elles se prolongent sous terre si loin, que personne,\r\ndit-on, n’est allé jusqu’au fond … parfois on les appelle Chambres\r\ndes fées. Il y en a où l’on voit, dit-on, des tables de pierre sur\r\nlesquelles elles mangeaient, leurs sièges, et les berceaux en pierre de\r\nleurs enfants.”--_Traditions et Superstitions de la Haute Bretagne_, p.\r\n84.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE CREUX MAHIÉ.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the southern coast of Guernsey, from Jerbourg, or St.\r\nMartin’s Point, to Pleinmont in the parish of Torteval, is extremely\r\nprecipitous, but abounding in picturesque beauties of no common\r\ncharacter. Bold headlands, with outlying granite rocks rising like\r\npyramids and obelisks from the clear blue sea, alternating with caves\r\nand bays to which access is gained through deep glens and ravines,\r\nsome richly wooded, some hemmed in on both sides by rugged hills,\r\nbut through all of which a tiny rill of the purest water trickles,\r\nkeeping up a perpetual verdure--slopes covered in early spring with\r\nthe golden blossoms of the gorse, in summer with the purple bells of\r\nthe heather, and in autumn with the rich brown fronds of the withering\r\nbracken--cliffs mantled in parts with luxuriant ivy, in other with many\r\ncoloured lichens, and out of every crevice of which the thrift, the\r\ncampion, and other flowers that delight in the vicinity of the sea,\r\nburst in wild profusion--all combine to form pictures which the artist\r\nand the lover of nature are never tired of studying.\r\n\r\nThe constant action of the waves for unnumbered centuries has worn out\r\nmany caverns in these cliffs, the most considerable of which is that\r\nknown by the name of “Le Creux Mahié,” or as some old writers wrote it\r\n“Mahio,” and it undoubtedly took its name, so says Mr. Métivier, from\r\nits ancient proprietor, the king of the infernal regions.\r\n\r\n    “The Prince of darkness is a gentleman;\r\n    Modo he’s called and _Mahu_.”\r\n\r\n               --_King Lear._ Act 3, Sc. 4.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoos have the same name in their _Maha-Dêva_, a giant of the\r\nfamily of the dives or demons.[65] In the province of Mayo, there is a\r\nSorcerer or Druid, the Priest of _Mayo_, who lives in a cavern, and is\r\ncalled “the King of the Waters.”\r\n\r\nIt is also sometimes called “Le Creux Robilliard,” from a family of\r\nthat name on whose property it was situated. It lies in the parish of\r\nTorteval, and is reached by a narrow pathway, winding down the almost\r\nprecipitous side of a steep cliff, into a small creek worn out by the\r\nsea between the headlands. The cave itself, there can be no doubt,\r\nmust have been formed by the waves wearing away gradually a vein of\r\ndecomposed rock, softer than that which forms the sides and roof. At\r\nsome remote period a large portion of the rock which forms the roof of\r\nthe cavern has given way, and has partially blocked up the entrance,\r\nleaving only a long low fissure through which access can be had to\r\nthe interior, and forming a sort of platform of solid stone, which\r\neffectually cuts off any further encroachment on the part of the sea. A\r\nsteep descent over broken fragments of rock leads down to the floor of\r\nthe cave, which appears to be nearly on a level with the beach at the\r\nfoot of the platform. A glimmering light from the entrance enables one\r\nto see that the rock arches overhead in a sort of dome, and a bundle of\r\ndry furze or other brushwood, set on fire, lights it up sufficiently\r\nto bring out all the details. It is a weird sight; as the flickering\r\nflames illumine one by one the various masses of rock that are piled up\r\nto the roof at the extremity of the cavern, and disclose the entrances\r\nto two or three smaller caves. These are, in reality, of no great\r\ndepth, but they are sufficiently mysterious to have given rise to more\r\nthan one report concerning them, and there are but few of the peasantry\r\nwho would be bold enough to attempt to explore their recesses. It is\r\nfirmly believed by them that there is a passage extending all the way\r\nunder ground as far as the Church of St. Saviour’s, about a mile\r\ndistant as the crow flies; and it is also affirmed that there is an\r\nentrance through a small hole to an extensive apartment, in the midst\r\nof which stands a stone table, on which are set out dishes, plates,\r\ndrinking vessels, and other requisites for a well-served feast, all of\r\nthe same solid material.[66]\r\n\r\nThere are obscure traditions of the cavern having been at some early\r\nperiod the resort of men who lived by stealing their neighbours’\r\nsheep, and plundering their hen-roosts, but these traditions cannot be\r\ntraced to anything more definite than what is commonly alleged of all\r\nsuch places, neither are the tales told of its having been the resort\r\nof smugglers more to be relied on. The difficulty of access to it,\r\neither by sea or land, makes it very improbable that it should have\r\nbeen used for this purpose; besides, in former days, Guernsey was a\r\nperfectly free port, nothing that entered was subject to any duty that\r\nit would have been profitable to evade, and before the establishment\r\nof a branch of the English Custom House, all exports could be made\r\nwithout the troublesome formalities of clearance and declaration now\r\nrequired. Of late years the smuggling of spirits into the island in\r\norder to avoid payment of the local dues in aid of the public revenue,\r\nhas been carried on to rather a large extent; but this has taken place\r\non more accessible parts of the coast. Possibly, however, tobacco made\r\nup in illegal packages, which would subject it to seizure if found\r\nwaterborne, may occasionally have been deposited here for a time, until\r\nit could be carried off secretly to the French vessels passing the\r\nisland in their coasting voyages between Normandy and Brittany.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated May, 1665, to one of his friends in Guernsey, from\r\nthe Rev. John de Sausmarez, who, on the restoration of Charles II., was\r\nappointed Dean of the Island, and subsequently Canon of Windsor, he\r\nalludes to “Le prophète du Creux Robilliard.” Who this prophet was does\r\nnot appear, but there is every reason to believe that the allusion is\r\nto the Rev. Thomas Picot, Minister of the then united parishes of the\r\nForest and Torteval, in the latter of which the Creux Mahié--_alias_\r\nRobilliard, is situated; for in the Assembly of Divines held at\r\nWestminster in 1644, articles were exhibited against this clergyman for\r\ntroubling the Church discipline established in the island, preaching\r\nAnabaptist doctrines, and prophesying that in 1655 there should be\r\na perfect reformation, men should do miracles, etc. This conjecture\r\nreceives some slight confirmation from the fact that it is still\r\nremembered in the Forest parish that a Minister of the name of Picot\r\nwas fond of retiring to caves on the sea-shore for meditation, and one\r\nof these caves in particular, that well known one in Petit Bot bay\r\nwith a double entrance, is still known by the name of “Le Parloir de\r\nMonsieur Picot.”\r\n\r\n[65] _Recherches Asiatiques_, Tome I., Traduit de l’Anglais.\r\n\r\n[66] This last piece of information was furnished by Caroline le\r\nTullier, of the Parish of the Forest, wife of Richard Murton.\r\n\r\n\r\nRocks and Stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LE PETIT BONHOMME ANDRELOT, OU ANDRIOU.”\r\n\r\n    “Screams round the Arch-druid’s brow the seamew--white\r\n    As Menai’s foam.”\r\n\r\n                                             --_Wordsworth._\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest forms of idolatry is undoubtedly that which was\r\npaid to rude stone pillars. These, whether erected for the purpose of\r\nmarking the last resting place of some renowned patriarch or warrior,\r\nor set up with the design of indicating a spot specially appropriated\r\nto religious rites, or perhaps, simply as a boundary or landmark,\r\ncame to be regarded, at first, as sacred, and in process of time,\r\nas a symbol of the Deity himself. Gradually any elevated rock, and\r\nespecially if it presented a striking and unusual appearance, was\r\nlooked upon with veneration. We find that this was particularly the\r\ncase in the north of Europe, and that the hardy mariners who navigate\r\nthe tempestuous seas of Scandinavia, are, even now, in the habit of\r\npaying a sort of superstitious respect to the lofty “stacks,” as the\r\nisolated masses of rock are called, which form the extremity of many\r\nof the headlands, and that, in passing, they salute them, and throw\r\nold clothes, or a little food, or a drop of spirits, into the sea, as\r\na sort of propitiatory offering. It is strange to find that the same\r\ncustom still exists in Guernsey, notwithstanding that a thousand years\r\nor more have elapsed since the Northmen first invaded these shores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Le Petit Bonhomme Andrelot, ou Andriou.”]\r\n\r\nEveryone who has visited Guernsey must know the lovely bay of Moulin\r\nHuet,[67] and the remarkable group of rocks, which stretches out into\r\nthe sea at its eastern extremity beyond the point of Jerbourg. These\r\nrocks are called “Les Tas de Pois d’Amont,” or “The Pea-Stacks of the\r\nEast.” There being a chain of rocks off Pleinmont which are called the\r\n“Tas de Pois d’Aval”--the westerly Pea-Stacks--“Amont” (meaning “en\r\nhaut”) is the Guernsey word for _east_, _aval_ meaning “en bas,” their\r\nword for _west_.[68]\r\n\r\nEach rock composing the Tas de Pois d’Amont has its own special name.\r\nThey are “Le Petit Aiguillon,” “Le Gros Aiguillon,” “L’Aiguillon\r\nd’Andrelot,” ou “du Petit Bon-Homme.”\r\n\r\nThe united and increasing action of the winds and waves has worn the\r\nhard granite rock into the most fantastic forms, and from certain\r\npoints of view it is not difficult to invest some of these masses of\r\nstone with a fancied resemblance to the human form. One of them in\r\nparticular, when seen at a certain distance, has all the appearance of\r\nan aged man enveloped in the gown and cowl of a monk.\r\n\r\nSo singular a freak of nature has not escaped the attention of the\r\npeasantry, and the rock in question is pointed out by the name of “Le\r\nPetit Bon-Homme Andriou.” The children in the neighbourhood have a\r\nrhymed saying:\r\n\r\n    _“Andriou, tape tout,”_\r\n\r\nwhich may be translated\r\n\r\n    “Andriou, watch all,” or “over all,”\r\n\r\nand the fishermen and pilots who frequent these parts of the coast show\r\ntheir respect by taking off their hats when passing the point, and are\r\ncareful to insist on the observance being complied with by any stranger\r\nwho may chance to be in their company. Formerly it was not unusual with\r\nthem, before setting sail, to offer a biscuit or a libation of wine or\r\ncider to “Le Bon Homme,” and, if an old garment past use chanced to be\r\nin the boat, this was also cast into the sea.[69]\r\n\r\nThere are other rocks on the coast which the fishermen are in the\r\nhabit of saluting without being able to give any reason why they do\r\nso; and it is not impossible that the honour paid to the little island\r\nof Lihou,[70] on the western coast of Guernsey, by the small craft,\r\nin lowering their topmasts while passing, may have originated in the\r\nsame superstition, although it is generally supposed that they do it\r\nout of reverence to the Blessed Virgin, the ruins of whose Chapel and\r\nPriory are still to be seen on the isle. The circumnavigation of a\r\ncertain rock by the fishermen of the parish of St. John, in Jersey, on\r\nMidsummer Day, may, perhaps, be traceable to the same source.\r\n\r\n[67] EDITOR’S NOTE.--“Moulin Luet,” according to Mr. Métivier--“Vier\r\nPort”--still in the mouths of the old country people.\r\n\r\n[68] (Par la même raison que le vent d’ouest est le vent d’_aval_, le\r\nvent qui vient de la partie la plus haute, la plus montueuse de France,\r\nest le vent d’_amont_.--_Métivier’s Dictionary_, page 36).\r\n\r\n[69] EDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nThere are several legends still repeated by the country people about\r\n“Le Petit Bon Homme Andriou.”\r\n\r\nOne is that he was a man searching for hidden treasure among the\r\nrocks of the Tas de Pois and that the guardian spirit of the treasure\r\nappeared and turned him into stone for his sacrilege.--_Collected by\r\nMr. J. Linwood Pitts, of the Guille-Allès Library._\r\n\r\nAnother is that he was an old Arch-Druid, the last of the Druids to\r\nhold out against Christianity. Miserable at his brethren’s apostacy\r\nfrom the faith of their fathers, he went to live in a cave at the end\r\nof Jerbourg Point. His favourite occupation was standing on the rocks\r\nof the Tas de Pois and gazing out to sea, for he was passionately\r\nfond of the sea and sailors. One day, during a violent gale, he saw a\r\nship in great distress out at sea, so he prayed to his gods to stop\r\nthe storm and save the ship. They took no notice of his prayers, the\r\nstorm still raged, and the ship was driven nearer and nearer to the\r\ndangerous rocks on which he stood. Then, in desperation, he prayed to\r\nthe God of the Christians, and vowed that if only the ship were saved\r\nhe would turn Christian and dedicate a Chapel to the Blessed Virgin.\r\nAs he prayed, the gale ceased, and the ship made its way safely to the\r\nharbour. And Andrillot, after being baptised as a Christian, dedicated\r\na Chapel; some say it is the one of which the ruins on Lihou Island\r\ncan still be seen, which is dedicated to “Notre Dame de la Roche;”\r\nothers say it was the Chapel, long since destroyed, which was on the\r\nFief Blanchelande in St. Martin’s parish, and which is believed to have\r\nstood where the parish school now stands.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, that little figure standing, looking out to sea,\r\npetrified there that he may yet bring good luck and fine weather to his\r\nbeloved sailors, is still looked upon by them with fond reverence, and\r\nthey still throw him in passing their drop of spirits, or doff their\r\nflag, for luck.--_From Mr. Isaac Le Patourel and others._\r\n\r\n“L’Bouan Homme Andriou,” as correctly printed in Gray’s map. This is\r\na _petrified Druid_, or rather Arch-Druid,--An _An Drio_--the Primate\r\nof the Unelli, and now the guardian of Moulin Huet and Saints’ Bays,\r\nGuernsey; for, according to Rowland, our ancestors called that mighty\r\nPrelate thus, and Toland in his _Celtic Religion_, p. 60, says “The\r\npresent ignorant vulgar believes that these enchanters the Druids were\r\nat least themselves enchanted by the still greater enchanter Patrick\r\nand his disciples, who miraculously confined them _to the places that\r\nbear their names_. And let me not be thought over minutious should I\r\nnotice the peculiar propriety of the epithet applied by rural tradition\r\nto this _most reverend_ rock of ours--“Le Bouan Homme,”--“bon homme”\r\nin France, and “good man” in England, still denoting a Priest two\r\ncenturies ago, particularly a priest of the old régime.”--_From Mr.\r\nMétivier._\r\n\r\n“LA BELLE LIZABEAU.”\r\n\r\nAnother instance of a traditionally petrified human being is a rock off\r\nthe Creux Mahié, standing straight out into the water. It is called\r\n“La Belle Lizabeau,” and a little rock at the foot of it is called\r\n“La Petite Lizabeau.” It is said that “Lizabeau” was a beautiful girl\r\nof Torteval, who was turned out of the house with her baby by her\r\ninfuriated father. Mad with despair she rushed to the cliffs and leapt\r\ninto the sea with her baby in her arms, and she and her child were\r\nturned into the rocks which now stand there.--_From Dan Mauger, an old\r\nfisherman of St. Martin’s Parish._\r\n\r\n[70] Dr. Heylyn says in his _Survey of the Estate of Guernzey and\r\nJarsey_, published 1656, p. 298:--“The least of these isles, but yet of\r\nmost note, is the little islet called _Lehu_, situate on the north side\r\nof the eastern corner, and neer unto those scattered rocks, which are\r\ncalled _Les Hanwaux_ appertaining once unto the Dean, but now unto the\r\nGovernour. Famous for a little Oratory or Chantery there once erected\r\nto the honour of the Virgin _Mary_, who, by the people in those times\r\nwas much sued to by the name of our Lady of _Lehu_. A place long since\r\ndemolished in the ruine of it. “_Sed jam periere ruinæ_,” but now the\r\nruines of it are scarce visible, there being almost nothing left of\r\nit but the steeple, which serveth only as a sea-marke, and to which,\r\nas any of that party sail along they strike their topsail. “_Tantum\r\nreligio potuit suadere._” Such a religious opinion have they harboured\r\nof the place, that, though the Saint be gone, the wals shall yet still\r\nbe honoured.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“LA ROQUE MANGI.”\r\n\r\nLa Roque Màngi was a natural granite formation having a very artificial\r\naspect. It stood on one of those sandy downs which extend along the\r\nnorth-west coast between “Le Grand Havre” and “Les Grand’ Rocques,” and\r\nconsisted of a slender upright mass of rock of from eight to ten feet\r\nin height, surmounted by a large stone, projecting about half a foot on\r\nevery side, resting on the narrowest part of the supporting stone, and\r\nlooking at a little distance like a petrified giant. It was destroyed\r\nby the proprietor of the land about the middle of the present century\r\nin the hopes of finding below it a profitable quarry of granite, in\r\nwhich, however, he was disappointed.\r\n\r\nOf this rock a curious legend was related by the neighbouring peasants.\r\nIt was said that the Devil, having quarrelled one day with his wife,\r\ntied her by the hair of her head to the upright stone, and that, in\r\nher frantic efforts to disengage herself by running round and round,\r\nshe wore away the solid granite to the narrow neck which supported the\r\nsuperincumbent head.[71]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name seems doubtful, some tracing it to a family\r\nof the name of Maingy, who possessed land in the parish in which the\r\nrock was situated. Others, with more probability, attributing it to\r\nthe “eaten”--“mangé”--(in the local dialect “màngi”) appearance of the\r\nstones, where the upper one or head joined the supporting upright.\r\n\r\n[71] From one of the Le Poidevins, of Pleinheaume.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LA CHAIRE DE ST. BONIT.”\r\n\r\nThis was also called “La Chaire au Prêtre,” and was situated in the\r\ndistrict of the Hamelins, a little to the north of the property known\r\nas St. Clair. It was a very regularly formed natural obelisk of about\r\neight to ten feet in height, rising from the summit of one of those\r\nhillocks, or “hougues” as they are locally called, which, before the\r\ngreat granite industry took its rise, abounded in St. Sampson’s and\r\nthe Vale parishes, and along the whole western coast. At the foot of\r\nthe upright rock was a large flat stone, giving the whole mass the\r\nappearance of a gigantic chair or pulpit. Seven stone hatchets have\r\nbeen unearthed in its vicinity. It was evidently used by the Druids as\r\none of their sacred chairs, in which their Pontiffs sat to instruct the\r\npeople. It is probable that towards the end of the seventh century,\r\nSt. Bonit, Bishop of Auvergne, who was known to have been a great\r\ntraveller, visited the land previously converted by St. Samson, St.\r\nMagloire, St. Paterne, and St. Marcouf, and sat and preached to the\r\npeople in this erst-while Druid’s throne, which henceforth bore his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LA ROCQUE OU LE COQ CHANTE.”\r\n\r\nThis very singular name is given to a picturesque mass of rock\r\nwhich forms the termination of a hill in the parish of Ste. Marie\r\ndu Castel, and abuts on the road leading from the village of Les\r\nGrands Moulins--better known as The King’s Mills--to Le Mont Saint.\r\nMr. Métivier gives as his explanation of this name that all this\r\nregion--from the Mont-au-Nouvel (now called Delancey Hill) to the\r\nCastiau Roc--was the centre of the Druids and their observances. “The\r\nEagle,” “The Cock,” “The Partridge,” “The Curlew,” were the names\r\nof various degrees in Theology[72] among the Druids and among the\r\nwestern sun worshippers. This “Coq” was the Prophet, the “Magician,”\r\nof the Canton. The Arch-Magician of the King of Babylon was Nergal or\r\n“Le Coq.” It is said to be a very favourite haunt of the fairies and\r\nwitches, and it is commonly reported that an immense treasure lies\r\nconcealed within it. In olden days it was the fashion to walk round\r\nit, stamping at the same time, the soil resounded under their feet,\r\nthey heard, or thought they heard, the monotonous sound of a bell,\r\ntolling a far-away knell, and hence the belief of a subterranean fairy\r\ncavern and hoards of concealed treasure.[73]\r\n\r\n[72] Christophor: Muyheus apud. Baheum, in Centur. de Script. Brit.\r\n\r\n[73] From Rachel Duport.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--In _Traditions et Superstitions de la Haute Bretagne_,\r\nTome I., p. 38, M. Paul Sebillot says:--“Presque tous les monuments\r\npréhistoriques passent pour renfermer des trésors, il en est de même\r\ndes gros blocs erratiques qui se trouvent dans les champs ou sur les\r\nlandes.”\r\n\r\n\r\nINSCRIBED STONE.\r\n\r\nOld people say that there was formerly a very large stone in St.\r\nAndrew’s parish on which was engraven an inscription in ancient\r\ncharacters. Some men who passed it every day in going to their work at\r\nlast succeeded in deciphering it, and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _“Celui qui me tournera_\r\n    _Son temps point ne perdra.”_\r\n\r\n    (To him who turns me up, I say,\r\n    His labour won’t be thrown away).\r\n\r\nThis inscription roused their curiosity, and they determined on making\r\na strong effort to raise the stone, fully persuaded that it concealed\r\nan enormous treasure. They procured crowbars and levers, and, at last,\r\nwith much labour and great loss of time, succeeded in lifting it, but\r\nwho can describe their disappointment when they found nought but the\r\nfollowing words, legibly engraved on the other side:--\r\n\r\n    _“Tourner je voulais_\r\n    _Car lassée j’étais.”_\r\n\r\n    (Tired of lying on one side\r\n    To get turned over long I’ve tried).[74]\r\n\r\n[74] A similar story is told in Scotland.

Old people say that the true name of the hill is\r\n“La Hougue ès Brinches,” from the broom which once grew there in large\r\nquantities. At the foot of this hillock, on the northern side, there\r\nis a flat stone imbedded in the earth, and on it are the marks of two\r\nfeet, pointing in opposite directions, as if two persons coming, one\r\nfrom the north, and the other from the south, had met on this spot and\r\nleft the impress of their footprints on the stone. Of course a story\r\nis not wanting to account for these marks. It is said that the Lady of\r\nLihou and the Lady of St. Brioc (or some say the Abbess of La Haye du\r\nPuits) had a dispute as to the limits of their territorial possessions,\r\nand that, in order to settle the question, they agreed to leave their\r\nrespective abodes at a certain hour before breakfast, and walk straight\r\nforward until they met. The spot where the meeting took place was to\r\nbe henceforth considered as the boundary, and to avoid any further\r\ndisputes a lasting memorial was to be placed on the spot.\r\n\r\nIf the country people are asked who these “Ladies” were, they can\r\ngive no further information about them, but they evidently consider\r\nthem to have belonged to the fairy-folk, who have left behind them so\r\nmany traces of their former occupation of the island. Antiquaries are\r\ndisposed to look upon the stone as having been placed there to mark\r\nthe boundary line between the Priories of Notre Dame de Lihou and St.\r\nBrioc.\r\n\r\nAnother story of this rock is that at Pleinmont lived a hermit who was\r\nmuch respected by all the island, and many people came to visit him in\r\nhis cell, which he never left, except to administer the Holy Sacrament\r\nto the dying. He used to be seen kneeling for hours at the foot of a\r\ncross upon the cliff; but one night a fisherman, anchored in Rocquaine\r\nBay, saw by the moon’s light this hermit cross the sands and meet a\r\ntiny shrouded figure which came from the direction of Lihou. They met\r\non this rock, and stood talking there for some time, and then each\r\nreturned the way he came, and in the morning, when the fisherman came\r\nto examine the place, he found the print of two feet. He could not make\r\nhimself believed when he told the story, until it was discovered that\r\nthe hermit had disappeared, never to be seen again.[75]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1829 a large quantity of coins, amounting, it is said, to\r\nnearly seven hundred in number, were dug up at no very great distance\r\nfrom this stone. The greater part were silver pennies, but there were\r\na few copper pieces among them; they were of the reigns of Edward II.\r\nof England, and Philip IV. of France. The discovery of this treasure\r\ninduced some men who lived in the neighbourhood to seek for more, and,\r\nunder the firm persuasion that the most likely spot to find it was\r\nunder the stone itself, they resolved on braving the danger which is\r\nsupposed to be incurred by removing stones which have been placed by\r\nthe fairies, and devoted a whole morning to clearing away the ground\r\naround it with a view to lifting it. They had, with great labour,\r\nsucceeded in loosening the stone just as the sun in its zenith marked\r\nthe hour of noon, an hour when all good workmen cease from their toil\r\nto eat their frugal mid-day repast, and to enjoy their siesta under the\r\nshelter of a hedge. They felt sure of success, and probably dreamt of\r\nthe uses to which they would put their treasure, but, alas, for their\r\nhopes. When they returned to their work at one o’clock, they found the\r\nstone as firmly fixed as ever, and resisting their utmost efforts to\r\nremove it. They were more convinced than ever that immense riches lie\r\nburied in this spot, but that it is useless to seek for them, and none\r\nsince that time have been bold enough to renew the attempt.[76]\r\n\r\n[75] From Miss Lane.\r\n\r\n[76] From Jean Le Lacheur, of Rocquaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LE PIED DU BŒUF.”\r\n\r\nIn the Vale parish there is a large tract of uncultivated land\r\ncommonly known by the name of L’Ancresse Common. It is said to owe\r\nits name of L’Ancresse--the anchoring place--to the circumstance of\r\nthe neighbouring bay having afforded a refuge to Robert the First,\r\nDuke of Normandy, and his fleet, when in danger of perishing in a\r\nviolent tempest. Our learned antiquary, Mr. George Métivier, is rather\r\ndisposed to derive the name from the Celtic “Lancreis,” “the place\r\nof the circle,” so many Druidical remains being still to be found on\r\nthe common as to render it highly probable that one of those circular\r\nenclosures, formed of upright stones, in which the Druids are supposed\r\nto have held their sacred assemblies, formerly existed here. Along the\r\nsea-coast are many eminences, known locally by the name of “hougues.”\r\nTheir height is not great, but they form picturesque objects in the\r\nlandscape. Here and there large masses of grey granite covered with\r\nlichens rise in irregular forms above the green sward, gay in spring\r\nwith the bright flowers of the furze and bluebell, and redolent with\r\nthe sweet perfume of the wild thyme and chamomile. In some of these\r\nrocks may be traced those curious excavations known by the name of rock\r\nbasins, which antiquaries have considered as artificial, but which\r\ngeologists are ready to prove to be the work of nature.\r\n\r\nOf late years many of these hougues have been quarried for the sake\r\nof the stone, which is preferred in London to all others for paving\r\npurposes, and if the demand should continue many of these hills will\r\nbe entirely levelled, and with them will disappear some of the most\r\ncharacteristic features in the scenery of that part of the island.\r\nWhile writing (1853), La Hougue Patris is advertised for sale, and\r\nstress is laid in the advertisement on the excellent quality of the\r\nstone which it contains. This hougue is situated on the north eastern\r\nextremity of L’Ancresse Bay, and is remarkable from the circumstance\r\nthat a portion of the rock, where it appears above ground, bears marks\r\nprecisely similar to those which would be left by the hoof of an ox\r\non wet clay. So remarkable an appearance has of course attracted the\r\nattention of the neighbouring peasants, who call the rock which bears\r\nthe impression “Le Pied du Bœuf.” Some old people relate that the\r\nDevil, after having been driven from the other parts of the island by a\r\nSaint whose name is now forgotten, made a last stand on this spot, but\r\nthat, after a long and desperate conflict, his Satanic Majesty was at\r\nlast constrained to take flight. In leaping, he left the marks of his\r\nhoofs imprinted on the stone. He directed his flight towards Alderney,\r\nbut on his way thither alighted on the Brayes rocks, where, it is said,\r\nsimilar marks of cloven feet are to be seen. Whether he got beyond\r\nAlderney, or settled down quietly in that island, is a point on which\r\nthe narrators of the tradition are by no means agreed.\r\n\r\nDid we not know that a family of the name of Patris was formerly\r\nnumerous in the Vale parish,[77] and that there is every probability\r\nthat the Hougue derived its name from some member of that family, to\r\nwhom, in ancient days, it may have belonged; we might be tempted to\r\nsuppose that the valiant Saint who forced the demon to fly was no other\r\nthan the renowned St. Patrick himself, especially as, according to some\r\naccounts, the Saint was a native of a village in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe town of St Maloes, within eight or ten hours of this island.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, with all the self-conceit of the nineteenth century,\r\nwe are apt to suppose that before the establishment of packets and\r\nsteamers, communication between the opposite coasts of the Channel was\r\ndifficult and infrequent, but we have only to open the lives of the\r\nBritish and Irish Saints to see with what ease and rapidity these holy\r\nmen effected the voyage, with no other conveyance than a stone trough,\r\na bundle of sea-weed, or perchance a cloak spread out on the boisterous\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\n[77] EDITOR’S NOTE.--The Patris were also a family of note in the\r\nparish of St. Martin’s in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth\r\ncenturies; a “Ville ès Patrys” was among the numerous subdivisions of\r\nthis parish. Much of their lands passed into the hands of the Bonamy\r\nfamily through the marriage of Marguerite Patris, daughter of Pierrot\r\nPatris, of Les Landes and St. Martin’s, to Pierre Bonamy, father of\r\nJohn Bonamy, King’s Procureur in 1495, builder of the old Bonamy house\r\nof Les Câches, and translator of the “Extente” from Latin into French\r\nin 1498.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The Devil’s Claw” at Jerbourg.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE DEVIL’S CLAW” AT JERBOURG.\r\n\r\nAs the inhabitants of Guernsey may be presumed to be acquainted with\r\nthe Chronicles of their own Duchy of Normandy, it is not improbable\r\nthat the following legendary tale, related of Duke Richard, surnamed\r\nSans-Peur, may be known to some of them.\r\n\r\nThe _Chronique de Normandie_, printed at Rouen in 1576, gives it in\r\nwords of which the following is a close translation. (Fol. 4. Sur\r\nl’an 797). “Once upon a time, as Duke Richard was riding from one of\r\nhis Castles to a Manor, where a very beautiful lady was residing, the\r\nDevil attacked him, and Richard fought with and vanquished him. After\r\nthis adventure the Devil disguised himself as a beautiful maiden,\r\nrichly adorned,[78] and appeared to him in a boat at Granville, where\r\nRichard then was. Richard entered into the boat to converse with and\r\ncontemplate the beauty of this lady, and the Devil carried away the\r\nsaid Duke Richard to a rock in the sea in the island of Guernsey, where\r\nhe was found.”\r\n\r\nHe is supposed to have anchored at La Petite Porte and leapt up the\r\ncliff and landed on the stone near Doyle’s Column at Jerbourg, where\r\nthe print of his claw is still to be seen. As you go along the road\r\nfrom the town to Doyle’s Column you see a large white piece of quartz\r\nwith a deep black splash right across it. It is on the right hand side\r\nof the road, just as it begins to rise towards Doyle’s Column, at the\r\nhead of the second vallum, or dyke, going down towards La Petite\r\nPorte. This stone was also the termination of the bounds at Jerbourg\r\nbeaten by the Chevauchée de St. Michel.\r\n\r\n[78] “Ceux qui effleurent tout au galop ne sauront point que, chez\r\nles Rabbins, _Lilith_, spectre nocturne, est ‘une diablesse’ sous la\r\nforme de cette ‘damoiselle richement aornée,’ qui ne fit les yeux doux\r\nà notre bon duc Richard, qu’afin de traiter ce nouvel Ixion comme la\r\nreine des Dieux avait traité le premier.”--_Georges Métivier._\r\n\r\n\r\n“LE PONT DU DIABLE.”\r\n\r\nIn former days that tract of land lying between St. Sampson’s Harbour\r\nand the Vale Church, and known by the name of “Le Braye du Valle,” was\r\nan arm of the sea, which at high water separated that part of the Vale\r\nparish called “Le Clos du Valle” from the rest of the island. At the\r\nbeginning of the present century, Sir John Doyle, then Lieut.-Governor\r\nof the island, seeing the inconvenience that might arise from the want\r\nof a ready communication with the mainland, in the event of an invading\r\nenemy effecting or attempting a landing in L’Ancresse Bay, caused the\r\ndyke near the Vale Church to be built. The land recovered from the sea\r\nbecame of course the property of the Crown, and was subsequently sold\r\nto private individuals, the purchase money being given up by Government\r\nto be employed towards defraying the expenses of constructing new roads\r\nthroughout the island.\r\n\r\nWhere fishes once swam, and where the husbandman once gathered sea-weed\r\nfor the manuring of his land, droves of cattle now graze, and fields\r\nof corn wave.[79] From the very earliest times, the want of an easy\r\ncommunication between the neighbouring parishes must have been felt,\r\nand attempts had been made to remedy the inconvenience by the erection\r\nof rude bridges. It would be strange, if the Devil, whose skill in\r\nthe construction of bridges in every part of Europe has certainly\r\nentitled him to the honourable appellation of Pontifex Maximus, had\r\nnot had a hand in building one of the three principal passages across\r\nthe Braye du Valle. Accordingly we find that the dyke at St. Sampson’s\r\nHarbour, known by the name of “Le Grand Pont,” is also called “Le Pont\r\ndu Diable,” and old people affirm that it has been handed down as a\r\ntradition from their forefathers, that shortly after the building of\r\nthe Vale Castle, the Devil threw up this embankment, in order to enable\r\nhim to cross over to that fortress with ease and safety.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the bridge may have been built by order of Robert the First,\r\nDuke of Normandy, father of William the Conqueror, sometimes called\r\n“Robert le Magnifique,” but quite as well known by the less honourable\r\ncognomen of “Robert le Diable,” and, if in the absence of documentary\r\nevidence, any reliance is to be placed in the tradition hitherto\r\ngenerally received that the Vale Castle, if not originally built, was\r\nat least considerably improved and strengthened by this Prince, it is\r\ncertainly not going too far to suppose that the bridge may owe its name\r\nto him, and not to his Satanic Majesty.\r\n\r\nOne observance connected with this bridge is worth mentioning. From\r\ntime immemorial persons from all parts of the island have been in\r\nthe habit of assembling here on the afternoons of the Sundays in the\r\nmonth of August. No reason is assigned for this custom, but as Saint\r\nSampson is looked upon as the first Apostle of Christianity in this\r\nisland, and as the church which bears his name is said to have been the\r\nfirst Christian temple erected in the island, and is, in consequence,\r\nconsidered in some respects as the mother church, may not this assembly\r\nbe the remains of a church-wake, observed in ancient times on the\r\nSunday following the feast of St. Sampson, that is to say, the 28th of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nSimilar meetings are common in Normandy and Brittany, where they are\r\ncalled “assemblies” and “pardons.”\r\n\r\nThe two other principal passages across the Braye du Valle were the\r\nbridges called “Le Pont Colliche” and “Le Pont St. Michel.” They\r\nconsisted of rude slabs of stone resting on huge blocks of rock, and\r\nwere dangerous, both from the sea-weed which attached itself to them,\r\nand rendered them exceedingly slippery, and also from the rapidity with\r\nwhich the tide, when rising, flowed in, for both of them were covered\r\nat high water. Many and sad were the accidents which had happened\r\nto incautious and belated passengers, and it is not wonderful that\r\nsuperstition believed these spots to be haunted by the ghosts of those\r\nwho had perished in attempting the crossing. The “Pont St. Michel,”\r\nsituated near the Vale Church, where the embankment now is, was held\r\nin especial dread. At night the “feu bellenger” or will-o’-the-wisp,\r\nwas to be seen dancing on the sands, and gliding under the bridge, and\r\neven at mid-day, when the sun was shining brightly, unearthly cries of\r\ndistress would be occasionally heard proceeding from that direction,\r\nthough no living being could be discovered, by whom they could possibly\r\nbe uttered.\r\n\r\nAn old woman, still alive, whose youth was spent in that neighbourhood,\r\nhas assured me that she has repeatedly heard the cries.\r\n\r\n“Le Pont Colliche” was situated about midway between the two others,\r\na little to the eastward of the road which now traverses the Braye.\r\nAccording to tradition, there was once a time when the opening at\r\nthe “Bougue du Valle”--the channel between the Grand Havre and the\r\nBraye--was so small that a faggot, weighted with stone, would have\r\nsufficed to stop it.\r\n\r\nAt that time the passage between the islands of Herm and Guernsey was\r\nso narrow that a plank laid down at low water enabled the Rector of\r\nSt. Sampson’s to cross over when his duty called him to perform divine\r\nservice in the Chapel of St. Tugual. Great quantities of the common\r\ncockle (_cardium edule_), locally known by the name of “cocques du\r\nBraye,” used to be gathered on the sands at low water. It is said,\r\nhowever, that even before the enclosure of the Braye they had begun to\r\ndisappear, and their increasing scarcity was attributed to the impiety\r\nof an old woman, who, unmindful of the sacred duty of keeping the\r\nsabbath holy, was in the habit of searching for these cockles on that\r\nday. A similar story is told to account for the rarity of a particular\r\nkind of periwinkle (_trochus crassus_) known here by the name of\r\n“Cocquelin Brehaut.”\r\n\r\nA stone, which has evidently served as the socket or base of a cross,\r\nand which is said to have come from the Pont Colliche, is still\r\npreserved at Les Grandes Capelles.\r\n\r\n[79] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Of course this was written long before the days of\r\ngreenhouses and the tomato-growing industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE LOVERS’ LEAP.”\r\n\r\n    “Ah me! for aught that ever I could read,\r\n    Could ever hear by tale, or history,\r\n    The course of true love never did run smooth.”\r\n\r\nThe promontory of Pleinmont forms the south-western extremity of\r\nthe island of Guernsey, and, to the admirer of the wild and rugged\r\nbeauties of cliff and rock scenery, affords an ever-varying treat.\r\nLofty precipices, in which the sea-birds and hawks nestle--huge\r\nmasses of granite piled into fantastic forms--covered with grey and\r\norange-coloured lichens, and gay with the flowers of the thrift and\r\nother sea-side plants, large rocks detached from the main-land and\r\ntenanted by long rows of the sun-loving cormorant, the ever-restless\r\nocean, now smiling and rippling under a summer sky, now lashed into\r\nfury by the wintry blast, all combine to add to the charms of this\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nMany accordingly are the parties which frequent this spot during\r\nthe summer, and it is probable that some of those who have visited\r\nthis place may remember a small promontory almost detached from the\r\nmainland, and forming the westernmost point of the island. To the\r\nsouthward of this promontory there is a sort of ravine, extending from\r\nthe table-land of Pleinmont to the edge of the cliff, where a small\r\nbreastwork of earth and stones has been erected. The reason why this\r\nspot, which is by no means the most dangerous along the coast, has been\r\nthus protected, is not very apparent. The existence of a small spring\r\nof water in the ravine, which keeps up a constant verdure and tempts\r\nthe cattle turned out to pick up a scanty living on the common to the\r\nplace, suggests a probable solution of the question; but the tradition\r\nof the peasantry assigns a far more romantic reason for the erection of\r\nthe parapet than the mere safety of a few stray heifers.\r\n\r\nThey say that in days long past, the son of a farmer in the\r\nneighbourhood formed an attachment for the daughter of a family with\r\nwhom his own was at variance. His affection was returned by the maiden,\r\nand the wishes of the lovers might, in the end, have triumphed over\r\nthe opposition of the parents, had not the hand of the girl been\r\npromised by her friends to one of the richest men in the parish. In\r\nvain did the unhappy maiden urge the cruelty of forcing her into a\r\nmarriage which her heart abhorred. In vain did her lover employ every\r\nmeans in his power to break off the hated contract. Their prayers and\r\nrepresentations were treated with scorn, and the preparations for the\r\nmarriage were proceeded with. The eve of the day appointed for the\r\nsolemn espousal--a ceremony which in ancient times preceded and was\r\ndistinct from that of marriage--had arrived. The lovers met by stealth\r\non the cliffs at Pleinmont, and, driven to despair, mounted together on\r\na horse, which they urged into a gallop, and, directing him down the\r\nravine, they fell over the precipice and perished in the waves below.\r\nTo commemorate the event, and to prevent the recurrence of a similar\r\ncatastrophe, the barrier was erected.[80]\r\n\r\n[80] From Miss Rachel Mauger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Les Fontaines de Mont Blicq, Forest.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nHoly Chapels and Holy Wells.\r\n\r\n    “Thereby a crystal stream did gently play,\r\n    Which from a sacred fount welled forth alway.”\r\n\r\n                                      --_Spenser._\r\n\r\n    “For to that holy wood is consecrate,\r\n    A virtuous well about whose flowery banks\r\n    The nimble-footed fairies dance their rounds\r\n    By the pale moonshine, dipping often times\r\n    Their stolen children, so to make them free\r\n    From dying flesh and dull mortality.”\r\n\r\n            --_Fletcher’s “Faithful Shepherdess.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nThough not strictly speaking “Folk-Lore,” the ancient priories and\r\nchapels of Guernsey are so closely connected with the holy wells that\r\nit may be as well here to give some details concerning them. It appears\r\nthat these chapels must have been of more than one kind. Some were\r\nendowed, and had a priest permanently attached to them with probably a\r\ncertain cure of souls. Others were most likely wayside oratories, where\r\ndivine service was only performed occasionally by the rector of the\r\nparish, or someone acting under him, on certain anniversaries. Some may\r\nhave been connected with religious guilds or fraternities.\r\n\r\nTo begin with those churches and chapels known to have been endowed,\r\nand which were probably--at least after the suppression of alien\r\npriories--under the patronage of the Crown.\r\n\r\nA Commission was appointed in the reign of Henry VIII. for the purpose\r\nof ascertaining the value of all livings within the kingdom, with a\r\nview to the duty called first-fruits, owing on the appointment of every\r\necclesiastic to a benefice, being henceforth paid to the Crown. From\r\nthis document we learn that besides the ten parochial churches there\r\nwere four other benefices--the vicarage of Lihou worth five pounds\r\nsterling, that of St. Brioc worth twelve shillings, the chaplaincy of\r\nSt. George worth sixty shillings, and that of “Our Lady Mares,” no\r\ndoubt Notre Dame des Marais, worth three pounds.\r\n\r\nThe first of these four, Lihou, was originally a priory dependent on\r\nthe Priory of St. Michel-du-Valle, which was of itself a dependency of\r\nthe great Abbey of Mont St. Michel in Normandy. The Prior of Lihou had\r\nprobably pastoral care of the district comprised in the Fief Lihou,\r\nextending along the coast called Perelle,[81] from L’Erée to Rocquaine\r\nCastle, where the district of St. Brioc begins. It also comprised\r\ncertain possessions in the Castel parish and elsewhere, and its feudal\r\ncourt was held near the western porch of the Castel Church, a little\r\nnorthward of the path leading to it, where are still to be seen three\r\nflat stones, which mark the spot.\r\n\r\nSt. Brioc was situated in the valley leading from Torteval Church to\r\nRocquaine. There is reason to suppose that it had a certain district\r\nallotted to it, but its limits are not now known.\r\n\r\nSt. George was only a chaplaincy, intimately connected with the Fief Le\r\nComte, the court of which formerly assembled in the chapel, and still\r\nmeets in its immediate vicinity. The earliest notice we have of this\r\nchapel is contained in the Bull of Pope Adrian IV., dated 1155. In the\r\nyear following Dom Robert de Thorigny--or, as he is sometimes called,\r\n“Du Mont”--abbot of the famous monastery of Mont St. Michel, visited\r\nthis island, and found one Guillaume Gavin established at St. George as\r\nchaplain: he was anxious to retire from the world, and, at his request,\r\nthe abbot admitted him into his community as a monk, and appointed\r\nGodefroy Vivier to succeed him as chaplain at St. George. After some\r\ntime Vivier followed the example of his predecessor, and took the frock\r\nat Mont Saint Michel, having previously made over certain lands which\r\nhe possessed in the neighbourhood of St. George to the abbey which\r\nafforded him shelter.\r\n\r\nIn 1408 the chaplain was Dom Toulley, who obtained an order from the\r\nRoyal Court prohibiting any one from trespassing on the road leading to\r\nthe chapel, it being reserved exclusively for persons attending divine\r\nservice, or sick people visiting the fountain, the small coin left as\r\nan offering at the well being doubtless a perquisite belonging to the\r\nchaplain.\r\n\r\nThis chapel was originally endowed with some lands or rents, probably\r\nwith the territory still known as Le Fief de la Chapelle, which is one\r\nof the many dependencies of the Fief Le Comte.\r\n\r\nAfter the Reformation St. George became in some way the property of\r\nthe de Jersey family,[82] and by the marriage of Marie de Jersey,\r\nan heiress, to Jacques Guille, which took place about the middle of\r\nthe seventeenth century, it passed into the possession of the latter\r\nfamily, by whom it is still held. This Marie de Jersey made a gift of\r\nthe chapel to the inhabitants of the Castel in about 1675 to serve as\r\na school house. A more convenient building was erected in 1736 on the\r\nsite of an old mill, and endowed with nine quarters of wheat rente by\r\nMarie de Sausmarez, widow of Mr. William Le Marchant, and the chapel\r\nceased to be used as a school house. Bickerings as to rights of way\r\nacross the estate, under the pretence that there was a thoroughfare\r\nleading to a public building, ensued, even after the removal of the\r\nschool; so finally Mr. Guille ordered the chapel to be demolished, and\r\nonly a few ruins are now left.\r\n\r\nThe Chapel of “Our Lady Mares”--Notre Dame des Marais--is thus\r\nmentioned in the Extente of Edward III., “Nostre Sire le Roy n’a rien\r\ndes vacations des eglises et chapelles, fors la Chapelle de Nostre Dame\r\ndes Maresqs qui vaut XXX lbts en laquelle iceluy Roy doit présenter en\r\ntems de la vacation, et l’Evesque de Coutance en a l’institution.” The\r\nchaplain then in possession, 1331, was Robert de Hadis.[83]\r\n\r\nThe other churches and chapels were not at this time in the gift of\r\nthe Crown, but belonged to alien monasteries, Marmoutiers, Mont St.\r\nMichel, and Blanchelande. The chapel itself was, there is very little\r\ndoubt, situated within the precincts of Le Château des Marais, now\r\nbetter known as Ivy Castle, and the Livres de Perchage of the Town\r\nparish of the time of Elizabeth and James I. mention certain fields in\r\nthe vicinity as belonging to it.\r\n\r\nThe Hospice and Chapel of St. Julien was situated at the bottom of the\r\nTruchot, in the district called Le Bosq, close to the sea-shore. There\r\nare many “St. Julians” in the calendar, one of them being considered\r\nthe special patron of travellers. In the title of his Legende MS.\r\nBodleian, 1596, fol. 4, he is called “St. Julian the Gode herberjoue.”\r\nIt ends thus:--\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, yet to this day, thei that over lond wende\r\n    Thei biddeth Saint Julian anon that gode herborw he hem sende.”\r\n\r\nChaucer had the familiar attribute of St. Julian before him when he\r\ndescribed his “Francklyn” or country gentleman:--\r\n\r\n    “An householder, and that a grete, was he:\r\n    Saint Julian he was in his own contré.”\r\n\r\nThe rock on which travellers to the island used to land, now the\r\nfoundation of the harbour, was “La Roche St. Julien,” and probably\r\nthe hospital, being situated near a landing place, was intended\r\nas a refuge for travellers, and therefore dedicated to him. This\r\nchapel was founded in the year 1361, the thirty-fifth of the reign of\r\nEdward III., at the time when Sir John Maltravers was Governor of the\r\nislands. The founder was a certain Petrus de St. Petro, or Pierre de\r\nSt. Peye, as we find it written in French. Permission was granted him\r\nby the Crown to found the said hospital or alms house for a master,\r\nbrethren and sisters, in a certain spot near _Bowes_ (Le Bosq,--this\r\nword was evidently Boués, Bois, a wood, with which the word Bouët is\r\nalso identical), in the parish of St. Peter Port, and to endow it with\r\ntwenty vergées of land and eighty quarters of wheat rent, out of which\r\ncertain dues were to be paid to the King. “La Petite École,” or parish\r\nschool, which has from time immemorial been situated in this vicinity,\r\nwas originally connected with St. Julian. It is generally believed\r\nthat the school was founded in 1513 by Thomas Le Marchant and Jannette\r\nThelry, his wife.\r\n\r\nAt the Reformation the chapel and hospital were suppressed, and its\r\nrevenues and possessions seized by the Crown. The parishioners of\r\nSt. Peter Port complained to the Royal Commissioners of 1607 of the\r\nalienation of this property, which they looked upon as belonging to the\r\nparish, but their complaint was not attended to. In the early part of\r\nthe century there were the remains of an old house, in a late debased\r\nGothic style of the fifteenth century, standing at the bottom of Bosq\r\nLane, which used to be looked upon as the remains of a conventual\r\nbuilding. The house in question was a residence of a branch of the de\r\nBeauvoir family, whose arms were carved in stone over the principal\r\nentrance. The stones forming this entrance were preserved, and are now\r\nin the ruins of the Chapel of St. George.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Franciscan Friary, there is no proof of any\r\nconventual establishments in the island, though tradition points to La\r\nHaye-du-Puits as being the site of an old convent. Doubtless in early\r\ntimes, and before the English had lost Normandy, the great monasteries\r\nwhich held lands in Guernsey may have had priories here. Mont St.\r\nMichel we know had the Priory of St. Michel du Valle, and there is some\r\nreason to believe that Blanchelande also had some establishment of\r\nthe kind in the island. How the Abbeys of Marmoutier, La Rue Frairie,\r\nCroix St. Lenfroy and Caen, all of which had possessions in the island,\r\nmanaged them, we have no means of knowing, though it was most likely by\r\nthe machinery of a feudal court.\r\n\r\nWe will now speak of the Priories of St. Michel du Valle and Notre Dame\r\nde Lihou.\r\n\r\nA tradition, which may be traced up to the time of Edward II., says\r\nthat certain monks, driven from Mont St. Michel for their dissolute\r\nlives, settled in the Vale parish and founded an abbey about the year\r\n968 A.D. The same authority informs us that they reformed their lives\r\nand became famous for their sanctity, and that when Robert, Duke of\r\nNormandy, visited the island in the year 1032, having been driven here\r\nby stress of weather while on his way to England with a fleet to the\r\nhelp of his nephew, Edward the Confessor, he confirmed them in the\r\npossession of the lands they had acquired. The same tradition also says\r\nthat in the year 1061 certain pirates attacked and pillaged the island,\r\nand that their leader “Le Grand Geoffroy,” or “Le Grand Sarasin,” had\r\nhis stronghold on the site of what is now the Castel Church. Complaint\r\nhaving been made to Duke William, he sent over Samson d’Anneville, who\r\nsucceeded, with the aid of the monks, in driving them out. For this\r\nservice they were rewarded by the Duke with a grant of one half of the\r\nisland, comprising, besides the Vale, what are now the parishes of the\r\nCastel, St. Saviour’s, and St. Peter’s-in-the-Wood. This grant they\r\ndivided between them, and the monks, in right of their priory, held\r\nthat portion of the lands which is still known as Le Fief St. Michel.\r\nThe rest is now comprised for the most part in the Fiefs Le Comte and\r\nAnneville and their dependencies. To the south-east of the Vale Church\r\nis an old farm house which still bears the name of L’Abbaye, and which,\r\nwithout doubt, occupies the site of the original priory. Even at the\r\npresent day, it is easy to trace part of the walls of the earlier\r\nedifice, which, however, was in a ruinous state as early as the reign\r\nof Henry IV., for we find Sir John de Lisle, Governor of Guernsey,\r\nwriting to the Privy Council about the year 1406 for permission to\r\nuse the timber of the building for the repairs of Castle Cornet, and\r\nalleging in his letter that the priory had fallen into decay, and\r\ngiving as a reason for his request that in consequence of the war it\r\nwas impossible to procure timber either from Normandy or Brittany.\r\n\r\nThe names of a few priors have survived. It is not quite clear whether\r\na certain Robert, whose name appears as witness to the deed by which\r\nRobert, Abbot of Mont St. Michel, during a visit which he made to the\r\nisland in 1156, appointed Guillaume Gavin, monk, to the chaplaincy\r\nof St. George, was Prior of the Vale or not. He is styled in the\r\ndeed Priest and Dean of the Vale (de Walo). In 1249 Henry, Canon of\r\nBlanchelande, was collated to the Vale Church by special dispensation.\r\nAbout 1307 Johannes de Porta was prior (probably a Du Port, a family\r\nof considerable antiquity in the island, and of good standing). In\r\n1312 Guillaume Le Feivre filled the office. In 1323 Renauld Pastey was\r\nPrior of the Vale, and had a lawsuit with the inhabitants of that and\r\nother parishes concerning tithes. In 1331 there was another dispute\r\nconcerning tithes, which was referred to the arbitration of two monks,\r\nGuillaume Le Feivre and Jourdain Poingdestre, who had both formerly\r\nbeen priors. In the year 1335 Andreas de Porta, 1364-68, Geoffrey de\r\nCarteret, and in 1365 Denis Le Marchant, clerk, was appointed seneschal\r\nof the Court of St. Michel.\r\n\r\nAccording to the ballad known as “La Descente des Arragousais,”\r\n“Brégard”[84] was the monk in charge of the priory in 1372, and by his\r\nintrigues the Vale Castle fell into the hands of the enemy, which was\r\nevidently a legend current at the time. Guillaume Paul, alias Règne, in\r\n1478, is the last prior of whom we have found mention.\r\n\r\nThe Priory of Lihou, as has been already said, was a dependency of\r\nSt. Michel-du-Valle. The ruins of the church and other buildings are\r\nstill to be seen. The former was entire at a time long subsequent to\r\nthe Reformation, and is said to have been destroyed at the command of\r\none of our Governors to prevent the possibility of its serving as an\r\nentrenchment in case of an enemy landing on the islet. It appears to\r\nhave replaced a still more ancient building, as many pieces of Caen\r\nstone, with well-executed Norman mouldings, are built into the walls.\r\nProbably the first building had been destroyed in some of the many\r\ninroads to which the island was subjected during the reign of Edward\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAn incumbent of Lihou, with the title of prior, existed until the time\r\nof the Reformation.\r\n\r\nNow to come to the remaining chapels. The Extente of Edward III. speaks\r\nof the King’s Chaplain, John de Caretier, who received a salary out of\r\nthe revenues of the island, and was bound to say mass daily for the\r\nKing, and for the souls of his ancestors either in the chapel of Castle\r\nCornet or in the chapel of His Majesty’s manor of La Grange. It is\r\nnot exactly known where this manor was situated, but as the estate of\r\nthe late John Carey, Esq., has always borne this name--the Grange--it\r\nis reasonable to suppose that it was thereabouts. The more so, as\r\nRichard II. founded the Convent of Cordeliers or Francisian friars on\r\nthe ground now belonging to Elizabeth College, probably then comprised\r\nin the Grange estate. It must be said, however, that there are also\r\nreasons for supposing that the King’s Grange may have been situated\r\nelsewhere, probably in the vicinity of the Tour Gand, a fortress which\r\ndefended the approaches of the town from the north, and this opinion\r\nderives some support from the fact that the Plaiderie, or Court House,\r\nis known to have existed in ancient times in this locality, and that in\r\nthe middle ages a chapel was considered an almost essential adjunct to\r\na Court of Justice.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Convent of the Cordeliers, it is known that the site\r\nof their church, called in Acts of Court “La Chapelle des Frères,” is\r\nsaid to have stood opposite to the entrance of Le Cimetière des Frères,\r\nwhich was the burial ground belonging to this church, and, together\r\nwith the site of the church, a considerable portion of land appears\r\nto have been alienated from the college, probably by the arbitrary\r\nact of some Governor of the island. The church consisted of a chancel\r\nand nave, the latter, on the building being given for the use of the\r\ncollege, serving as a school-room, and the former being occupied by the\r\nmaster. After its alienation the burial ground fell into the hands of\r\nan individual of the name of Blanche, who turned it into an orchard,\r\nbut, a plague having broken out in 1629, the Court made an order that\r\nall who died of that disorder should be buried there, since which time\r\nit has served for a cemetery for the Town parish. How the burial ground\r\nattached to the Town Church came to acquire the name of “Cimetière des\r\nSœurs” cannot now be known, as there can be no doubt that from time\r\nimmemorial it was no other than the parochial cemetery. There is no\r\ndocument known to exist which points to any conventual establishment\r\nfor females in the island, though there are traditions to that effect.\r\nThere was, however, among many other fraternities, a “confrèrie de\r\nfrères et sœurs” connected in some measure with this cemetery, and\r\nwhich may have given it the name. At the Reformation the land and rents\r\ndue to this fraternity were seized by the Crown, and the list of them\r\nis still preserved among the records at the Greffe, with the following\r\nheading--“Confessions de rentes dues aux frères et sœurs de la\r\nconfrerye et fraternité de la charité, fondeye pour la dilyvrance des\r\names de purgatoyre, par les dis frayres et sœurs, constytuée, establye\r\net ordonnée, en la Chapelle de Sepulcre estante dedans le cymetyere de\r\nSt. Pierre Port,” &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThis proves the existence of a chapel in the churchyard, but whether\r\nit was the building known by the name of “Le Belfroi,” and which was\r\ndemolished in 1787, cannot now be ascertained. “Belfroi” is the name\r\ngiven in the mediæval ages to a Town Hall. The edifice known by that\r\nname in St. Peter Port belonged to the Town, and was used latterly as\r\na store-house for militia requisites. It is described as having been\r\nbuilt of stone, vaulted, and divided into two apartments, an upper\r\nand a lower, the latterly partly underground. Probably the lower part\r\nof the building was used as a charnel house, in which the bones of\r\nthe dead, after they had lain long enough in the ground to become\r\nquite dry, were piled up; for, among the duties to be performed by\r\nthe officiating priest, we find that they were required to chant a\r\n“recorderis” over the bones of the dead. Such charnel houses are\r\nstill very common in Brittany, and many country places throughout the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nOf the other chapels which existed in the Town parish the memory even\r\nhas perished. The estate known as Ste. Catherine may possibly have\r\nderived its name from a chapel dedicated to that virgin martyr, but all\r\nthat is known is that there was a fraternity or religious association\r\nunder the patronage of this saint, which was endowed with wheat rents.\r\nSome of the rents seized by the Crown, and afterwards made over to\r\nElizabeth College, were due to the “Frerie de Ste. Catherine,” and\r\npossibly this body possessed its own chapel. The site of the Chapel of\r\nSt. Jacques is well known, and traces of the foundations were still to\r\nbe seen till comparatively lately. It was situated in a field on the\r\nMon Plaisir estate, on the right hand side of the lane which leads from\r\nthe Rue Rozel to the back of the Rocquettes, at the head of a little\r\nvalley, just where the roadway is at the lowest. The orchard to the\r\neast of this spot, on the opposite side of the lane, is still known by\r\nthe name of Le Cimetière, and human bones are still occasionally met\r\nwith in digging. It had some land attached to it by way of endowment,\r\nwhich was sold by the Royal Commissioners in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, as we learn from the Livre de Perchage, temp. Elizabeth, in\r\nwhich it is called “La Chapelle de _l’ydolle_, St. Jacques,” and that\r\nThomas Effard was in possession of land that had belonged to it. From\r\nthe same document we learn that there was also a chapel called “La\r\nChapelle de Lorette,” which, there is reason to suppose, may have been\r\nin the vicinity of Candie.\r\n\r\nThere was also a private chapel, of which we should have known\r\nabsolutely nothing but for an old contract, still extant, of the early\r\ndate of 1383, by which Perrot and Jannequin Le Marchant[85] sell a\r\npiece of ground for building purposes to Renolvet Denys. One of the\r\nconditions attached to the sale is that no edifice shall be erected on\r\nthe land thus sold, which can in any manner take away from the view,\r\nor deprive the chapel of the manor and hall of the vendors, of light.\r\nThe property in question was, without doubt, that to the south of the\r\narch, leading to Manor Le Marchant and Lefebvre Street, and it is\r\ncurious that the contract mentions the existence of a vaulted gateway\r\nleading to the manor, at that early period permission being given to\r\nthe purchaser of this ground to build over this arch. An archway still\r\nexists in the locality, and continues to bear the name of “La Porte,”\r\nas it did nearly five hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nNow, to come to the only chapel that still exists--Ste. Apolline.\r\nThere is no reason for supposing it to be of such great antiquity as\r\nis generally believed. The vault is pointed, and it is well known that\r\nthe pointed arch did not make its appearance in architecture until the\r\nlatter part of the twelfth century--say about 1160--whereas all our\r\nparishes are named in documents anterior to 1066. From the Cartulary\r\nof Mont Saint Michel we learn that in the year 1054 William Pichenoht,\r\nmoved by compunction for the many and great sins he had committed, and\r\ndesirous of turning monk, gave, with the consent of Duke William of\r\nNormandy, his lands of La Perrelle with all their appurtenances to the\r\nabbey. These lands were, no doubt, leased out afterwards by the monks\r\nto various individuals, the abbey retaining the “Seigneurie” over the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1392, a certain Nicholas Henry, of La Perrelle, obtained\r\nthe consent of the Abbot and monks of Mont St. Michel, as Lords of\r\nthe Manor, to the endowment of a chapel which he had lately erected\r\non his estate, subject, however to the sanction of the Sovereign as\r\nlord paramount. This permission was granted by Richard II. in July,\r\n1394. The charter which is preserved among the island records at\r\nthe Greffe authorises Nicholas Henry to endow the Chapel of _Sainte\r\nMarie de la Perrelle_ for the purpose of maintaining a chaplain\r\nwho was to celebrate a daily mass for ever, for the safety of the\r\nsaid Nicholas Henry[86] and his wife Philippa, for their souls after\r\nthey should have departed this life, and for the souls of all their\r\nancestors, benefactors, and Christian people generally. Beside the\r\nthree vergées of land, which are described as being bounded on the\r\nwest by the property of Guillaume Blondel, and on the east by that\r\nof Thomas Dumaresq, both of which families are still landowners in\r\nthe district, Nicholas Henry also gave to the chapel an annual wheat\r\nrent of four quarters due on a piece of ground adjoining. The chapel\r\nonce established, other gifts were made from time to time by pious\r\nindividuals who took part in the daily service. In 1485, Johan de\r\nLisle, son of Colas, and Nicholas de Lisle, son of Pierre, acknowledged\r\nin the presence of the Bailiff and Jurats that they owed jointly the\r\nyearly rent of a hen to the Chaplain of Notre Dame de la Perrelle; and\r\nthe latter acknowledged, moreover, to the annual payment of one bushel\r\nof wheat. On March 2nd, 1492, Henry Le Tellier, of St. Saviour’s, also\r\nacknowledged that he owed two bushels of wheat rent to Sire Thomas\r\nHenry, who is also mentioned as Chaplain of St. Brioc, in 1477, and\r\nas Rector of the Castel, in 1478. He was also styled in an earlier\r\ndeed, “Dom” Thomas, so was probably also a Benedictine monk, and it\r\nis not unlikely that he was grandson of the original founder of this\r\nchapel. Its identity with the building still existing is proved by\r\nan Act of the Royal Court “en Plaids d’Héritage” of June 6th, 1452,\r\nin which the chapel is spoken of as “La Chapelle de Notre Dame de la\r\nPerrelle, appelleye la _Chapelle Sainte Appolyne_.” It was then in the\r\npossession of Colin Henry, son of Jacques, and grandson of Nicholas,\r\nwho is described as the founder of the chapel. Forty years later it\r\nchanged hands, and was in the possession of the Guille family, perhaps\r\nby inheritance, for in April, 1496, Nicholas Guille, son of Nicholas,\r\nof St. Peter Port, sold the advowson of the chaplaincy to Edmond de\r\nChesney, Seigneur of Anneville, in whose family it probably remained\r\nuntil they[87] sold their possessions to the Fouaschin family, from\r\nwhom they came by inheritance into the family of Andros.[88]\r\n\r\nWe do not know how the name of Ste. Apolline came to be associated\r\nfirst with that of the Blessed Virgin, and then to have superseded\r\nit altogether. Possibly because there were already no less than five\r\nplaces of worship in the island under the invocation of Our Lady--the\r\nChurches of the Castel, Torteval,[89] and Lihou, and the Chapels of\r\nPulias and _Le Château des Marais_, commonly known as Ivy Castle. Saint\r\nApollonia, or in French, Ste. Apolline, is said to have been a virgin\r\nof Alexandria, who was burned as a Christian martyr in the year 249.\r\n\r\nThe chapel is twenty-seven feet long by thirteen feet nine inches wide,\r\nand is built of rough unhewn stone, except the heads of the doorways,\r\nthe jambs of the windows, and the corner stones of the edifice, which\r\nappear to have been coarsely wrought. The vault is in solid masonry of\r\nsmall stones cemented with a strong mortar, and if it was ever slated\r\nor tiled all traces of the covering have long since disappeared. The\r\ninterior is stuccoed, and was originally adorned with mural paintings,\r\nof which some slight traces are yet to be seen. Figures of angels,\r\nand part of a group which seem to have been intended to represent the\r\nnativity of our Saviour, are still to be made out. There are three\r\nsmall narrow square headed windows, which may or may not once have been\r\nglazed--one in the east gable immediately above where the altar must\r\nhave stood, and the other two in the north and south walls, near the\r\neast end of the building. There is no opening whatever in the western\r\ngable, which was surmounted originally by a bell-cote, of which the\r\nbase only now remains. The hole through which the bell rope passed is\r\nstill to be seen in the interior. To the south of the chapel is a very\r\nancient and substantially built farm-house, which is traditionally said\r\nto have been the residence of the officiating priest. It is quite as\r\nprobable that it was the manor house of the founder, Nicholas Henry.\r\nIn it were preserved the iron clapper of a bell, which is said to have\r\nbelonged to the chapel, and some wrought stones, which probably formed\r\nthe supports of the altar slab. A small silver burette, one of a pair,\r\nsuch as are used in the Roman Catholic Church to contain the wine and\r\nthe water employed in the celebration of the mass, by tradition came\r\noriginally from this chapel, it bearing the inscription “Sancte Paule\r\nora pro nobis,” and on the lid is the letter A, denoting that it was\r\nthe vessel intended to contain the water. It was in the possession\r\nof the ancient family of Guille, whose representative gave it to the\r\nParish Church of St. Peter Port in memory of his father.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Perrelle Bay there is a rock, standing at\r\nsome little distance from the shore, never covered by the tide, and\r\napproachable when the tide is out, called “La Chapelle Dom Hue.” The\r\nappearance of the natural causeway, or, as it is locally termed “col”\r\nor “pont,” which leads to it, would induce one to believe that at some\r\nremote period it must have been a narrow neck of low land stretching\r\nout into the sea, which divided the bays of L’Erée and La Perrelle,\r\nand which has been gradually carried away by the constant action of\r\nthe waves, leaving only the little hillock we now see. Probably, in\r\nancient times, a small oratory, perhaps a hermitage, had been erected\r\non this spot by a pious founder, “Dom” Hue, who, from his title, must\r\nhave been a Benedictine monk, and, in all likelihood, a member of\r\nthe Abbey of Mont Saint Michel, which was in possession of lands in\r\nthis neighbourhood. There is still a small manor in the parish of St.\r\nSaviour’s which bears the name of “Les Domaines Dom Hue,” and which\r\nwe may reasonably suppose belonged originally to the same person, and\r\npossibly formed the endowment of the chapel.\r\n\r\nThe next chapel of which anything definite is known is “Notre Dame\r\nde Pulias,” otherwise “La Chapelle de l’Epine.” The ground on which\r\nit stood lies on the sea-shore, to the northward of the promontory\r\nof Noirmont, and, though separated from the rest of the parish by an\r\nintervening strip of land belonging to the Vale, forms in reality part\r\nof St. Sampson’s. The Vale parish consists of two distinct portions,\r\nthe larger of which, called “Le Clos,” was, until the beginning of the\r\npresent century, entirely divided from the rest of the island by an\r\narm of the sea, which extended from St. Sampson’s Harbour to the Grand\r\nHavre near the Vale Church, and which was only passable at low water.\r\nThe inhabitants of that part of the parish attached to the mainland\r\nof Guernsey, and which is called “La Vingtaine de l’Epine,” were thus\r\ncut off at times from all access to their parish church, and appear to\r\nhave made use of this building, as a chapel of ease. It stood close to\r\n“La Mare de Pulias,” and in this neighbourhood a bit of wall is still\r\nshown, which is said to have formed part of the chapel. It is probable\r\nthat it was under the patronage of the Seigneurs of Anneville, for the\r\nearliest notice found of this chapel is in an “extente” of this fief,\r\ndated 1405, in which it is stated that the common lands, extending\r\nalong the shore between “La Chapelle de Notre Dame de Pulayes” and the\r\nrivulet of St. Brioc at Rocquaine, belong in moieties to the Abbot of\r\nSt. Michel and the Lord of Anneville. This chapel had an endowment,\r\nfor we find by the report of the Royal Commissioners of 1607 that the\r\nparishioners of the Vale and St. Sampson’s petitioned that it might be\r\nrestored to them, complaining--\r\n\r\n“That whereas their predecessors, the inhabitants of the Vingtaine of\r\nthe Epine, had in former times built a chapel, with a churchyard, for\r\ndivine service, by reason of the sea, which doth oftentimes hinder them\r\nfrom going to their parish church of the Valle; and that since that\r\ntime His Majesty’s Commissioners having considered how necessary that\r\nchapel was for them, it hath pleased the late Queen Elizabeth to grant\r\nunto them yearly ten or twelve quarters of wheat, for the maintenance\r\nboth of the said chapel, and also of a schoolmaster to instruct their\r\nchildren; notwithstanding all which the said chapel, together with the\r\nchurchyard, hath been utterly ruinated and the trees beaten down, and\r\nthe grounds and rents belonging thereunto taken away, to the great\r\ngrief and prejudice of the said parishioners, and therefore they humbly\r\ndesire that the said chapel be built again by them that have thus\r\nruinated it, and the rents belonging thereunto, for so necessary a use,\r\nbe restored unto them again, with the tithes and rights concerning it.”\r\n\r\nThe answer and decision of the Commissioners was not satisfactory.\r\nThey owned there was probably a chapel of ease on that spot, and they\r\ngo on to state that, having examined some aged people who dwelt near\r\nthe place, as well as the Lieutenant-Governor and other officers, they\r\nfind that ten or twelve quarters of wheat had been given either towards\r\nthe maintenance of the chapel or of a schoolmaster, and that some had\r\nheard divine service said there about the beginning of the reign of\r\nElizabeth and long before, but they can find no evidence to prove\r\nthat it was founded or built for a chapel of ease, the complainants\r\naccounting for the absence of documentary evidence in support of their\r\nclaim by alleging that the Governor had taken it away with him. The\r\nCommissioners go on to say that on further examinations they have had\r\nthere was a certain Popish superstitious service used therein, and that\r\nwheat rents had been given by certain inhabitants for the saying of a\r\nmorrow mass upon Sundays, and for such like superstitious uses, and\r\nthat about forty years previously, the chapel, with all appertaining\r\nto it, had been seized for the use of the Queen. The conclusion they\r\narrived at was that the seizure was legal, and should be maintained.\r\n\r\nAt the north-east extremity of the Clos-du-Valle, near the estate\r\ncalled Paradis, and a little way beyond the cromlech called Déhus or\r\nThus, stood La Chapelle de Saint Malière or Magloire, an early apostle\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\nAll traces of this chapel have long since disappeared, but its site\r\nis still pointed out as being that of a little thatch-covered cottage\r\non the side of the hill.[90] The old farmhouse close by, called “St.\r\nMagloire,” is said to have been the residence of the priest attached to\r\nits service.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned as early as the year 1155 in a Bull of Pope Adrian IV.\r\n(Breakspear), together with other churches and chapels in Guernsey,\r\nas being the property and in the patronage of Mont Saint Michel. The\r\nonly other notice we have of this chapel is the tradition recorded by\r\nsome of our historians that, at the time of the Reformation, the plate,\r\nornaments, vestments, and records, belonging to the churches in this\r\nisland, were secretly buried here by the Roman Catholic clergy, with\r\na view to their removal to Normandy when a fitting opportunity should\r\noffer, but that one John Le Pelley, a schoolmaster, having by some\r\nmeans got information of the circumstances, dug them up some few years\r\nlater, and sold them to some Normans of Coutances, who conveyed them\r\naway.\r\n\r\nSaint Magloire was the nephew and pupil of Saint Samson, and was born\r\nin the middle of the sixth century. He succeeded his uncle, Samson, as\r\nBishop of Dol, but after a few years resigned his charge and retreated\r\nto Sark, where he founded a sort of monastery or missionary college,\r\nand where he died. His remains were translated in the ninth century to\r\nLéhon, near Dinan, and afterwards to Paris, where they were deposited\r\nin the church which still bears the name of the saint.\r\n\r\nTwo localities in the immediate neighbourhood of St. Malière bear the\r\nsingular names of “_Paradis_” and “_Enfer_.” Tradition is entirely\r\nsilent as to the origin of these names, but it is possible that they\r\nmay have been in some way connected with the chapel, and with some of\r\nthe superstitious usages so common among the nations of Celtic origin.\r\n\r\nThe Chapel of St. Clair was named after the first Bishop of Nantes,\r\nwho lived in the third century. This chapel stood on the hill a little\r\nto the eastward of the farmhouse in Saint Sampson’s parish which still\r\nbears the name. In clearing the ground for quarries of late years many\r\nhuman bones and a few gravestones have been discovered there.\r\n\r\nIt was situated on the “Franc-Fief Gallicien,” the tenants of which\r\nenjoy to this day an exemption from certain feudal duties, which is\r\nsaid to have been granted to their forefathers by King Edward IV. in\r\nacknowledgment of the services rendered by them as mariners in bringing\r\nhim to this island from Exmouth, when, as Earl of March, he escaped\r\nwith the famous Earl of Warwick, and their followers from England,\r\nafter a victory gained by Henry VII. over the Yorkist party in October,\r\n1459.\r\n\r\nThe Chapel of St. Germain was in the Castel parish, and its holy\r\nwell, which is still regarded by some as no less efficacious than the\r\nfountain of St. George, was situated to the northward of that chapel.\r\nAll traces of the building have long since disappeared, and all that\r\nwe know of it is that in the Extents of Queen Elizabeth and James I.\r\na rent payable to the Crown is described as “due on a piece of ground\r\nsituated near the Chapel of St. Germain.”\r\n\r\nThere is also said to have been a Chapel of Ste. Anne, near the King’s\r\nMills, more correctly designated as Les Grands Moulins. St. Anne also\r\nhad her sacred fountain. The names of “Ste. Hélène,” at St. Andrew’s,\r\nand La Madeleine, St. Pierre-du-Bois, may also have been derived from\r\nreligious buildings, but of these nothing but the names now remain.\r\n\r\nIn St. Martin’s parish there was a chapel attached to the Priory of\r\nBlanchelande, and another, Saint Jean de la Houguette, which very\r\nprobably was erected on the site now occupied by the parish school.[91]\r\n\r\nIn the Extente of the Fief Anneville it is said that the lord has his\r\n“Chapelles.” It is probable that all the feudal lords who held the\r\nlands direct from the Crown had the same right of chapel. Such at least\r\nseems to have been the case in Jersey, where some still exist, and\r\nin the Clos-du-Valle, situated in the Vale parish, is a field called\r\n“La Chapelle du Sud,” west of a field called “Le Galle,” on the Crown\r\nlands. Here was probably the site of a now forgotten chapel.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the chapels and churches are the holy wells.\r\nEven in pagan times, before the introduction of Christianity, it is\r\nwell known that a sort of worship was paid to the nymphs or deities who\r\nwere supposed to haunt these fountains, and to whose interference were\r\nattributed the cures effected by the use of these waters. When a purer\r\nfaith was preached, and it was found impossible to wean the minds of\r\nthe people entirely away from a belief in the supernatural qualities\r\nof these springs, the early missionaries--whether wisely or not it is\r\ndifficult to say--sought to direct the attention of their converts into\r\na new channel, and bestowed the name of some saint on these hallowed\r\nspots, who thenceforth was supposed to stand in the place of the\r\nancient local deity or genius of the well.\r\n\r\n[81] In the _Dédicace des Eglises_, “Notre Dame de Lihou” is called\r\nNotre Dame de la _Roche_. Now the word Perelle is a diminutive of\r\nPierre, and we know that in our dialect “pierre” and “rocque” are used\r\nindiscriminately, and have the same meaning.\r\n\r\n[82] EDITOR’S NOTE.--The Fief St. George was bought from the Royal\r\nCommissioners by Thomas Fouaschin, Seigneur d’Anneville, in 1563,\r\nlet to Pierre Massey 25th June, 1616, and bought 18th May, 1629, by\r\nNicholas de Jersey, son of Michel, from George Fouaschin, Seigneur\r\nd’Anneville, son of Thomas.

Thinking it was sacrilegious to move it,\r\nand would entail ill-luck on them and their children, they left it in\r\nits place, and there it still remains.\r\n\r\n[91] See note on page 197.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoly Wells.\r\n\r\nHoly wells still exist in many parts of the island, and are resorted\r\nto for various purposes, but principally for the cure of erysipelas,\r\nrheumatism and glandular swellings, and inflammation or weakness of the\r\neyes. These maladies are all called by the country people “Mal de la\r\nFontaine.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Wishing Well, Les Fontaines, Castel.”]\r\n\r\nWhether the water will prove efficacious as a remedy is ascertained by\r\nnoticing the effect produced on applying it. If it evaporates rapidly,\r\npassing off in steam, or runs off the swelling like little drops of\r\nquicksilver, it is of the right sort, and the sufferer may hope for\r\na speedy cure. Still, there are certain ceremonies to be observed,\r\nwithout which it is useless to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nIt must be applied before the patient has broken his fast for nine\r\nconsecutive mornings, and must be dropped on to the affected place with\r\nthe fingers, and not put on with a sponge or rag. It must be taken\r\nfresh from the well every day at daybreak. The person who draws it\r\nmust on no account speak to anyone either on his way to, or from the\r\nfountain, and must be particularly careful not to spill a single drop\r\nfrom the pitcher. It is customary to leave a small coin on the edge\r\nof the well, which was doubtless intended originally as an offering\r\nto the saint who was supposed to have the spring under his especial\r\nprotection, and whose name it bore. These wells are said also to be\r\nused for purposes of divination. The maiden who is desirous of knowing\r\nwho her future husband is to be, must visit the fountain for nine\r\nconsecutive mornings fasting and in silence. On the last day when she\r\nlooks into the clear basin of the well, she will see the face of him\r\nshe is fated to wed reflected in the water. Should her destiny be to\r\ndie unmarried, it is believed that a grinning skull will appear instead\r\nof the wished-for face.\r\n\r\nThe well most in repute is that of St. George, in the parish of\r\nSte. Marie du Castel, but St. Germain and Ste. Anne, at no great\r\ndistance, have their votaries, and there are also the “Fontaine de\r\nSt. Clair,” near St. Andrew’s Church, the fountain of Gounebec in the\r\nvalley of that name near the Moulin de Haut, two in the parish of the\r\nForest,--that known by the name of “La Fontaine St. Martin,” which\r\nrises on the cliffs to the westward of the point of La Corbière, and\r\nthe other at a point between Le Gron and La Planque, where the three\r\nparishes of the Forest, St. Saviour’s, and St. Andrew’s meet. The\r\n“Fontaine de Lesset,” at St. Saviour’s, is also renowned. In the parish\r\nof St. Peter Port the fountain of Le Vau Laurent was famous for the\r\ncure of sore eyes, and the water of another on the side of the hill\r\nbelow Les Côtils, known formerly as “La Fontaine des Corbins,” was\r\nsupposed to be efficacious in cases of consumption if taken inwardly.\r\n“La Fontaine Fleurie,” near Havelet, and another in the marshes near\r\nthe ruined stronghold of “Le Château des Marais,” commonly known as the\r\nIvy Castle, are also resorted to. The fountains of St. Pierre and Notre\r\nDame are mentioned in early ordinances of the Royal Court. The former\r\nis known to have been situated near the Town Church, at a spot called\r\nLe Pont Orchon, in the street which still bears the name of “La Rue de\r\nla Fontaine.” The latter was apparently at the foot of the Mont Gibet,\r\nat the upper end of what is now the Market Place. The erection of pumps\r\nover most of these springs has deprived them of their ancient prestige,\r\nand has effectually removed any curative properties which they may\r\nformerly have possessed. Although every spring was not efficacious in\r\nall cases, to insure a cure it was necessary to use the water of a\r\nparticular well, and, in order to choose it to consult certain persons\r\nwho are knowing in these matters, and who, by an inspection of the part\r\naffected are able to tell what particular spring should be resorted\r\nto.[92]\r\n\r\n[92] EDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nThere are two wells or rather fountains, for it is imperative that\r\nthey should be fed by a stream of running water, in St. Martin’s; one,\r\ncalled “La Fontaine des Navets,” is on the right hand side of the cliff\r\nabove Saints’ Bay; it is best approached from the Icart road, by the\r\nturning to the left down a little lane, opposite Mr. Moon’s cottage.\r\nThis lane runs just behind Mrs. Martin’s pic-nic house. There are two\r\nwells in this lane, but the second, the most southerly, is the sacred\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe other fountain was called “La Fontaine de la Beilleuse,” and was\r\nsituated just east of the church, below the farmhouse, belonging to Mr.\r\nTardif. That again, was a double fountain, of which the southern was\r\nthe wishing well, but it has now unfortunately been done away with,\r\nwhile the upper one has been converted into a drinking trough for\r\ncattle. Both these fountains cured the red swellings known as “Mal de\r\nla Fontaine.” When I asked why these should be efficacious, and not any\r\nother, I was told that it was because they looked east, and were fed by\r\nsprings running towards the east.--_From Mrs. Le Patourel, Mrs. Mauger,\r\netc._\r\n\r\nSee M. Sebillot’s _Traditions et Superstitions de la Haute Bretagne_,\r\nT. I., p. 45:--“Au moment où le Christianisme s’introduisit en Gaul,\r\nle culte des pierres, des arbres et des fontaines y était florissant.\r\nDe l’an 452, date du deuxième concile d’Arles, à l’an 658, concile\r\nde Nantes, nombre d’assemblées ecclesiastiques s’occupèrent de la\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\nSee also _Notions Historiques sur les Côtes-du-Nord_, par Havasque,\r\nT. I., p. 17:--“De l’usage que les druides faisaient de l’eau des\r\ndifférentes sources est venue le culte que les Bretons ont si longtemps\r\nrendu aux fontaines.… Lors de l’établissement du Christianisme, les\r\nprêtres les consacrèrent à Dieu, sous l’invocation de la Vierge ou de\r\nquelque Saint, afin que les hommes grossiers, frappés par ces effigies,\r\ns’acoutumassent insensiblement à rendre à Dieu et à ses Saints\r\nl’hommage qu’ils adressaient auparavant aux fontaines elles-mêmes.\r\nTelle est l’origine des niches pratiquées dans la maçonnerie de presque\r\ntoutes les fontaines, niches dans lesquelles on a placé la statue du\r\nsaint qui donne son nom à la source. C’est pour parvenir au même but\r\nque le clergé fit ériger à la mème époque des chapelles dans les lieux\r\nconsacrés à la religion ou au culte.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLE POULAIN DE SAINT GEORGE.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the well of St. George as being supreme in\r\nits sanctity; indeed we may almost say that its reputation is such that\r\nit throws all others into the shade. It stands near the ruined chapel\r\nof the same name.\r\n\r\nA place of such antiquity and reputed sanctity might naturally be\r\nexpected to have its legends, though many doubtless have disappeared,\r\nbut a firm faith still exists in the miraculous properties of the water\r\nof the well, and the old people still say that on tempestuous nights,\r\nespecially during thunder and lightning, the form of a horse, darting\r\nflames of fire from its eyes and nostrils, may be seen galloping\r\nthrice, and thrice only, round the ruined precincts of the chapel.\r\n\r\nSome accounts of the spectral appearance speak only of a horse’s head\r\nenveloped in flames, without the accompaniment of a body.[93]\r\n\r\nThe territory of St. George was also formerly known by the name of “St.\r\nGrégoire,” and, though Nicholas Breakspear, Pope Adrian IV., numbers\r\n“La Chapelle de St. George” among the possessions of St. Michel in\r\nhis Bull of 1155, Robert de Thorigni calls it “St. Grégoire” in 1156,\r\nbut in many places the St. George of the legends seems to have been\r\nconfused with the “Egrégoires,” the watcher, “l’ange qui veille,” of\r\nthe old world. It is, according to mythology, “l’Egrégoire” who mounts\r\nthe white horse that leads to victory, which apparition, in the moment\r\nof danger, has roused so many Catholic armies from despair.\r\n\r\nThe fountain was so much resorted to for divers superstitions formerly,\r\nthat in 1408 an Act was passed by the Royal Court, at the request\r\nof Dom Toulley, Prêtre de St. George, under the Bailiff Gervais de\r\nClermont, that the pathway to the fountain was only open to the\r\nfaithful on their way to divine service, or to the sick who came to be\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\nWe may add that an adjoining field bears the name of “Le Trépied,”\r\na name which is to be found in other localities in the island, and\r\nwhich indicates that a primæval stone monument, of the nature of those\r\ncommonly called Druid’s altars, may have at one time stood there.\r\nThese, as has already been shown, have always had the reputation of\r\nbeing the haunt of fairies, and sometimes of spirits of a less innocent\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n[93] From G. Métivier, Esq.\r\n\r\n“Our Lady and St. George were often partners in worship; and the\r\nlatter’s holy wells are famous in old legends:--‘And the Kynge (of\r\nLybie) did to make a chyrche there of our Lady and of Saynte George.\r\nIn the whyche yet sourdet a fountayn of lyving water whyche heled the\r\nseke peple y^{t} drinken thereof.’”--_Caxton’s Edition of the Golden\r\nLegend_, fol. cxi.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--See _Croyances et Légendes du Centre de la France_, by\r\nLaisnal de la Salle, Tome I., p. 324.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LEGEND OF ST. GEORGE’S WELL.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick and St. George, in the days when there were “saints errant”\r\nas well as “knights errant,” both happened to come to Guernsey, and\r\nmet on this spot. St. Patrick had just arrived from Jersey, where\r\nthe inhabitants had pelted him with stones and treated him with such\r\nsystematic rudeness that the saint, furious, came on to Guernsey, and\r\nthere he was welcomed with effusion. Meeting St. George, they began\r\nto quarrel as to whom the island should in future belong. However,\r\nbeing saints, they decided that it would be more consistent with their\r\nprofession each to give some special boon to the island, and then go\r\ntheir ways. So St. Patrick filled his wallet with all the noxious\r\nthings to be found,--toads, snakes, etc.,--and went back to Jersey and\r\nthere emptied it, freeing Guernsey for ever from all things poisonous,\r\nwhile giving to Jersey a double share. St. George smote the tiny\r\nstream at his feet, “the waters to be for the healing of diseases, and\r\na blessing to whoever shall own this spot. He shall never lack for\r\nbread, nor shall he ever be childless whilst this well be preserved\r\nuntainted.” Now, many, many years ago, the Guilles, who still own St.\r\nGeorge, inherited it from the De Jerseys, and it so happened that the\r\nlord of the estate had an only son who was naturally very dear to him.\r\nAn old friend of the family brought him a canary bird as a pet, and,\r\nas one had never before been seen in Guernsey, it was very precious.\r\nOne day it flew away from its cage, the door being accidentally left\r\nopen, and was pursued hotly by the child. It made for the well, and\r\napparently flew in, for the child was bending forward, an act which\r\nwould inevitably have caused him to fall in, when he was arrested by\r\nthe neighing of a horse behind him. He looked round and saw the fiery\r\nhead of St. George’s charger disappearing among the trees. That look\r\nsaved him, and the bird was seen perched on the cross above the well,\r\nsinging loudly. Presently it flew back to its little master, who had\r\nbeen saved by St. George from a watery grave, and a picture of the\r\nboy with his canary bird is still to be seen among the Guille family\r\nportraits.[94]\r\n\r\n[94] From Miss Lane, afterwards Mrs. Lane Clarke.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIDENS AT ST. GEORGE’S WELL.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious property attached to this well, that is that if a\r\nmaiden visits it, fasting and in silence, on nine successive mornings,\r\ncarefully depositing a piece of silver in the niche as an offering to\r\nthe saint, she is assured of matrimony within nine times nine weeks,\r\nand, by looking into the well with an earnest desire to behold the\r\nimage of the intended husband, his face will appear mirrored in the\r\nwater. And, in former times, when the man was identified, the girl\r\ngave his name to the priest, who then summoned him before St. George,\r\nand, as destined for each other by Heaven, they were solemnly united.\r\nThere is still a tradition extant of one of the neighbouring girls of\r\nthe parish, being forbidden by her father to marry the man on whom her\r\nheart was set, on the ground of his poverty, declaring that, having\r\nseen his face in the well, he was evidently destined for her by Heaven,\r\nand that she would claim him as her fate before the priest. On this her\r\nfather, fearing the exposure and public censure, gave his consent to\r\nthe marriage.[95]\r\n\r\nThere is also a legend told by Mr. Métivier of a country girl stealing\r\nout one summer night in the year 1798, to meet her lover near the well,\r\nflying home terrified, having seen a troop of bare skeletons grouped\r\nround the well, and gazing into the troubled waters.\r\n\r\nConnected with the Chapel of St. George was a cemetery, which boasted\r\nof many relics, famous for their miracles.\r\n\r\nAt one time this cemetery was said to be haunted by a beautiful young\r\ngirl. Every night wailing and crying was heard, and a figure was seen,\r\nmuch mangled, walking about. The cries were supposed to proceed from\r\nthe tomb of a girl who had disappeared from her home one night in a\r\nmost mysterious manner, and whose mangled corpse was picked up a few\r\ndays later near the Hanois rocks, so battered and bruised that it was\r\nevidently not a case of suicide. However, in course of time, a grave\r\nbeing opened near hers, some bones were thrown up, and, being handled\r\nby an old man who in days gone by had been the murdered girl’s lover,\r\na stream of blood oozed out of the dry bone! and with awful shrieks he\r\nowned to having been her murderer, and was executed soon afterwards at\r\nthe “Champ du Gibet” at St. Andrew’s.\r\n\r\n[95] From Miss Lane, afterwards Mrs. Lane Clarke.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the statement on page 181 that Torteval Church is\r\nunder the invocation of Our Lady. In “_A Survey of the Estate of\r\nGuernzey and Jarzey_ by Peter Heylyn,--1656,” p. 320, he says:--“that\r\n(church) which is here called Tortevall (is dedicated) as some suppose\r\nunto St. Philip, others will have it to St. Martha.”\r\n\r\nOn page 187 it is said that a chapel probably existed on the site of\r\nSt. Martin’s Parish School. In Elie Brevint’s MSS. written in the early\r\npart of the 17th Century he says:--“Les Havillands de St. Martin ont\r\ndonné la chappelle pour servir d’eschole, et de la terre auprès deux\r\nfois autant que la verd de Serk, comme dit Thomas Robert.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFairies.\r\n\r\n    “Come, frolick youth, and follow me\r\n    My frantique boy, and I’ll show thee\r\n    The country of the Fayries.”\r\n\r\n         --_Drayton’s “Muses Elizium, 1630.”_\r\n\r\n    “O l’heureux temps que celui de ces fables,\r\n    Des bon démons, des esprits familiers,\r\n    Des forfadets, aux mortels secourables!\r\n    On écoutait tous ces faits admirables\r\n    Dans son château, près d’un large foyer:\r\n    Le père et l’oncle, et la mère et la fille,\r\n    Et les voisins, et toute la famille,\r\n    Ouvraient l’oreille à Monsieur l’aumonier,\r\n    Qui leur ferait des contes de sorcier.\r\n    On a banni les démons et les fées;\r\n    Sous la raison les grâces étouffées,\r\n    Livrent nos cœurs à l’insipidité;\r\n    Le raisonner tristement s’accrédite;\r\n    On court hélas! après la vérité,\r\n    Ah! croyez-moi, l’erreur a son mérite.”\r\n\r\n                                  --_Voltaire._\r\n\r\n                               “Fairy elves\r\n    Whose midnight frolics by a forest side\r\n    Or fountain, some belated peasant sees.”\r\n\r\n                                 --_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULAR NOTIONS ABOUT FAIRIES.\r\n\r\nIt is not very easy to ascertain precisely what the popular idea of a\r\nfairy is. The belief in them seems to have died out, or, perhaps, to\r\nspeak more correctly, they are no longer looked upon as beings that\r\nhave any existence in the present day. That such a race did once\r\nexist, that they possessed supernatural powers, that they sometimes\r\nentered into communication with mankind, is still believed, but all\r\nthat is related of them is told as events that happened long before\r\nthe memory of man, and it is curious to see how a known historical\r\nfact--the invasion of the island by Yvon de Galles in the fourteenth\r\ncentury,--has, in the lapse of ages, assumed the form of a myth, and\r\nhow his Spanish troops have been converted into denizens of fairyland.\r\nPerhaps, as has been suggested by some writers who have made popular\r\nantiquities their peculiar study, all fairy mythology may be referred\r\nto a confused tradition of a primæval race of men, who were gradually\r\ndriven out by the encroachments of more advanced civilization.\r\nAccording to this theory the inferior race retired before their\r\nconquerors into the most remote parts of the woods and hills, where\r\nthey constructed for themselves rude dwellings, partly underground and\r\ncovered with turf, such as may still be found in Lapland and Finland,\r\nor made use of the natural fissures in the rocks for their habitations,\r\nthus giving rise to the idea that fairies and dwarfs inhabit hills\r\nand the innermost recesses of the mountains. In the superior cunning\r\nwhich an oppressed race frequently possesses may have originated the\r\nopinion generally entertained of the great intelligence of the fairy\r\npeople--and, as it is not to be supposed that a constant warfare was\r\ngoing on between the races, it is far from improbable that some of the\r\nstories which turn on the kindly intercourse of fairies with mortals,\r\nmay have arisen in the recollection of neighbourly acts. The popular\r\nbelief that flint arrow-heads are their work--the names given in these\r\nislands--“_rouets des faïkiaux_,” or fairies’ spindles, to a sort of\r\nsmall perforated disc or flattened bead of stone which is occasionally\r\ndug up, and “_pipes des faïkiaux_” to the tiny pipes which date from\r\nthe first introduction of tobacco,--their connection in the minds of\r\nthe peasantry with the remains commonly called druidical, and, indeed,\r\nwith any antiquity for which they cannot readily account, are all more\r\nor less confirmatory of the theory above alluded to. Some years ago a\r\ngrave, walled up on the inside with stones, and containing a skeleton\r\nand the remains of some arms, was discovered on a hillside near L’Erée.\r\nThe country people without hesitation pronounced it to be “_Le Tombé du\r\nRouai des Fâïes_.”\r\n\r\nOne well-preserved cromlech in the same neighbourhood is called\r\n“Le Creux des Fâïes” and the local name of cromlechs, in general\r\n“pouquelâie,” may have some reference to that famous fairy Puck, or\r\nRobin Goodfellow, the west country Pixie, or Pisky, and the mischievous\r\nIrish goblin Phooka.\r\n\r\nAccording to the best accounts the fairies are a very small people,\r\nand always extremely well dressed. The inhabitants of Sark attribute\r\nto them the peculiarity of carrying their heads under their arms. They\r\nare fond of sporting among the green branches of the trees, and on\r\nthe borders of running streams. They are supposed to live underground\r\nin ant hills, and to have a particular affection for upright stones,\r\naround which they assemble, or which they use as marks in some of their\r\ngames, and the removal of which they are apt to resent by causing\r\ninjury to the persons or property of those who are bold enough to brave\r\ntheir displeasure in this respect. Some are domestic, living invisibly\r\nabout the hearth-stone or oven, but willing to make themselves useful\r\nby finishing the work which the housewife had not been able to complete\r\nduring the day. They expected, however, as a reward for their kind\r\noffices that a bowl of milk porridge should be set on the floor for\r\nthem when the family retired to rest. On one occasion a fairy was heard\r\ncomplaining that the porridge was too hot and scalded her. The sensible\r\nadvice was given--to wait until it cooled.\r\n\r\nThe few stories about fairies that I have been able to collect are\r\ngiven in these pages, and are very much the same as those related\r\nin other countries. Of the more elaborate fairy tale--that which\r\nrecounts the adventures of a life-time, and in which a supernatural\r\nbeing--commonly called a fairy, but who has little or nothing in common\r\nwith the fays who dance on the green sward by the light of the moon--is\r\nthe directing influence either for good or bad,--I have been able to\r\ndiscover only the very slightest trace.\r\n\r\nThat such tales did once exist, and that they were related by nurses\r\nto amuse their young charges, is, I think, sufficiently proved by\r\nallusions sometimes made to Chendrouine, as our old acquaintance\r\nCendrillon or Cinderella is called, and by the fact that a friend of\r\nmine remembers an old servant telling him the story of “Pel de Cat,”\r\nevidently the same as the English story of “Cat-skin,” which however\r\nappears in the French collections of fairy tales by the name of “Peau\r\nd’Ane.” All that my friend could recall to mind were the words in which\r\nthe heroine of the tale is welcomed into a house where she seeks for\r\nshelter, and which have a rhythmical cadence that smacks strongly of\r\nantiquity:--\r\n\r\n    _“Entre, paure Pel-de-Cat, mànge, et bés, et séque té.”_\r\n\r\n    (Enter, poor Cat-skin, eat, drink, and dry yourself).[96]\r\n\r\nBut the best informed among the peasantry do not hesitate in expressing\r\ntheir belief that the fairies were a race who lived long before\r\nthe ancestors of the present occupants of the land had effected a\r\nsettlement in the island; that the cromlechs were erected by them for\r\ndwelling places, and that the remains of pottery which have been from\r\ntime to time discovered in these primæval structures plainly prove\r\ntheir derivation.\r\n\r\nThat the fairy race possessed supernatural strength and knowledge\r\nthere can be no doubt, or how could they have moved such enormous\r\nblocks of stone? Whether their strength and extraordinary science was a\r\ngift from Heaven, or whether they acquired these endowments by having\r\nentered into a league with the powers of darkness, is a very doubtful\r\nand disputed question. Some say they were a highly religious people,\r\nand that they possessed the gift of working miracles. Others shake\r\ntheir heads and say that their knowledge, though perhaps greater, was\r\nof the same nature as that possessed in later times by wizards and\r\nwitches, who, as everybody knows, derive their power from the wicked\r\none.[97]\r\n\r\nSome fifty or sixty years since, it was still firmly believed in the\r\ncountry that the fairies assisted the industrious, and that, if a\r\nstocking or other piece of knitting was placed at night on the hearth\r\nor at the mouth of the oven with a bowl of pap, in the morning the work\r\nwould be found completed and the pap eaten. Should idleness, however,\r\nhave prompted the knitter to seek the assistance of the invisible\r\npeople, not only did the work remain undone and the pap uneaten, but\r\nthe insult put upon them was severely revenged by blows inflicted on\r\nthe offending parties during their sleep.[98]\r\n\r\nIt is asserted by some old people in the neighbourhood of L’Erée that,\r\nin days gone by, if a bowl of milk porridge was taken in the evening to\r\nthe “Creux des Fâïes,” and left there with a piece of knitting that it\r\nwas desired to have speedily finished, and a fitting supply of worsted\r\nand knitting needles, the bowl would be found next morning emptied of\r\nits contents, and the work completed in a superior manner.[99]\r\n\r\n[96] EDITOR’S NOTES.--(In St. Martin’s there still lingers a version\r\nof the English Tom Thumb, the “Thaumlin” or “Little Thumb” of the\r\nNortherners, who was a dwarf of Scandinavian descent. I was told the\r\nfollowing story in 1896, but the old woman who told me owned that she\r\nhad forgotten many of the details.)\r\n\r\n“LE GRAND BIMERLUE.”\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time a woman had a very tiny little son, who was always\r\ncalled P’tit Jean. He was so small that she was continually losing\r\nhim. One day he strayed into a field, and was terrified at seeing a\r\nlarge bull rushing towards him, having broken loose from his leash.\r\nHoping for shelter, he ran and hid under a cabbage leaf, but in vain,\r\nfor the bull ate up the cabbage leaf, and swallowed “P’tit Jean” as\r\nwell. Soon his mother was heard calling “_P’tit Jean! P’tit Jean! je\r\ntràche mon P’tit Jean_.” (“P’tit Jean! P’tit Jean! I am looking for\r\nmy P’tit Jean,”) so, as well as he could, he answered “_Je suis dans\r\nle ventre du Grand Bimerlue_.” (“I am in the stomach of the ‘Grand\r\nBimerlue.’”) Astonished and frightened at hearing these unusual sounds\r\ncoming from the bull, the woman rushed in and implored her husband to\r\nkill “Le Grand Bimerlue,” as she was sure he must be bewitched. This\r\nwas accordingly done, and they cut up the carcase for eating, but the\r\nentrails were thrown into the nearest ditch. An old woman was passing\r\nby and saw them lying there, so picked them up and put them in her\r\nbasket, saying--\r\n\r\n“_Y en a des biaux boudins pour mon diner._”\r\n\r\n(“Here are some fine black puddings for my dinner.”)\r\n\r\nAll the time the boy was calling--\r\n\r\n    _“Trot, trot le vier,_\r\n    _Trot, trot la vieille,_\r\n    _Je suis dans l’ventre_\r\n    _Du Grand Bimerlue.”_\r\n\r\n    “(Trot, trot old man,\r\n    Trot, trot old woman,\r\n    I am in the stomach\r\n    Of the Grand Bimerlue).”\r\n\r\nHearing these sounds issuing from her basket she hurried home and cut\r\nopen the stomach of the bull, from whence emerged “P’tit Jean” none the\r\nworse for his adventure. He ran home to his mother, who had begun to\r\nthink that she would never see him again.--_From Mrs. Charles Marquand._\r\n\r\n[97] From Mrs. Savidan.\r\n\r\n[98] From Miss E.

One morning, as was her usual custom,\r\nshe left her cottage at an early hour to attend to her cows, when, on\r\nentering the meadow, she was astonished to find asleep on the grass,\r\nunder the shelter of a hedge, a young man of very small stature, but\r\nfinely proportioned, and remarkably handsome. He was habited in a rich\r\nsuit of grass-green, and by his side lay his bow and arrows. Wondering\r\nwho the stranger could be, and fascinated by his beauty and splendid\r\nappearance, the maiden stood in silent admiration, until he awoke\r\nand addressed her. Her person and manners seem to have had as much\r\ninfluence on the youth as his appearance had produced on the damsel. He\r\ninformed her that he was a fairy from England, and made her an offer\r\nof his hand. She immediately consented to unite her destiny with his,\r\nand followed him to the sea-shore, where a barque was waiting, which\r\nconveyed the happy pair to fairyland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Creux des Fâïes.”]\r\n\r\nTime passed on, and the disappearance of the maiden was almost\r\nforgotten, when, one morning, a man who was going down to Vazon Bay\r\nat day-break was surprised to see a numerous host of diminutive men\r\nissuing, like a flock of bees, from the Creux des Fâïes, and lurking\r\namong the reeds and rushes of Le Grand Marais. He inquired who they\r\nwere, and what had induced them to visit the Holy Isle. One, who\r\nappeared their leader, answered for all, and told the affrighted man,\r\nthat, charmed with the beauty and grace of the damsel that one of their\r\ncompanions had brought from the island, they were determined also to\r\npossess wives from the same country. They then deputed him to be the\r\nbearer of a message to the men of Guernsey, summoning them to give up\r\ntheir wives and daughters, and threatening them with their heaviest\r\ndispleasure in case of a refusal. Such an exorbitant demand was, of\r\ncourse, with one accord refused, and the Guernseymen prepared to defend\r\ntheir families and drive the bold invaders from their shores. But,\r\nalas! what can poor mortals avail against supernatural beings! The\r\nfairies drove them eastward with great carnage. The last stand was made\r\nnear Le Mont Arrivel, but, wearied and dispirited, they fell an easy\r\nprey to their merciless enemies, who put every soul to the sword. Their\r\nblood flowed down to the shore, and tinged the sea to a considerable\r\ndistance, and the road where this massacre took place still retains\r\nthe memory of the deed, and is known to this day by the name of La\r\nRouge Rue. Two men only of St. Andrew’s parish are reported to have\r\nescaped by hiding in an oven. The fairies then entered into quiet\r\npossession of the families and domains of the slain; the widows began\r\nto be reconciled to their new masters, the maidens were pleased with\r\ntheir fairy lovers, and the island once more grew prosperous. But this\r\nhappy state of things could not last for ever. The immutable laws of\r\nfairyland will not allow their subjects to sojourn among mortals more\r\nthan a certain number of years, and at last the dwellers in Sarnia were\r\nobliged to bid adieu to the shady valleys, the sunny hills, and flowery\r\nplains, which they had delighted to rove amongst and which their skill\r\nand industry had materially improved. With heavy hearts they bade adieu\r\nto the scene of their fondest recollections, and re-imbarked. But,\r\nsince then, no Guernsey witch has ever needed a broomstick for her\r\nnocturnal journeys, having inherited wings from her fairy ancestors,\r\nand the old people endeavour to account for the small stature of many\r\nfamilies by relating how the fairies once mingled their race with that\r\nof mortals.[100]\r\n\r\n[100] Communicated by Miss Lane, to whom the story was related by an\r\nold woman of the Castel parish.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAIRIES AND THE NURSE.\r\n\r\nThe fairies sometimes avail themselves of the services of mankind, and\r\nin return are willing to assist and reward them as far as lies in their\r\npower, but woe to the unhappy mortal who chances to offend them!--for\r\nthey are as pitiless as they are powerful.\r\n\r\nIt is said that one night a woman, who lived in the neighbourhood of\r\nHoumet and who gained her livelihood by nursing and attending on the\r\nsick, heard herself called from without. She immediately arose, and,\r\nlooking out, saw a man who was totally unknown to her standing at the\r\ndoor. He accosted her, and, telling her that he required her services\r\nfor a sick child, bade her follow him. She obeyed, and he led the way\r\nto the mouth of the little cavern at Houmet, called Le Creux des Fées.\r\nShe felt alarmed, but, having proceeded too far to retreat, resolved\r\nto put a bold front on the matter, and followed her mysterious guide.\r\nAs they advanced, she was astonished to find that the cave put on a\r\ntotally different appearance--the damp rugged walls became smooth, and\r\na bright light disclosed the entrance of a magnificent dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman soon comprehended that she had penetrated into\r\nfairyland, but, relying on the good intentions of her conductor, she\r\nfollowed him into an apartment where a child was lying ill in a cradle,\r\nwhom she was desired to attend to and nurse. She entered on her new\r\nduties with alacrity, and was plentifully supplied by the fairies with\r\nevery necessary and even luxury. One day, however, as she was fondling\r\nthe infant, some of its spittle chanced to touch her eyes. Immediately\r\neverything around her put on a different aspect--the brilliant\r\napartment once more became a dismal cavern, and squalor and misery\r\nreplaced the semblance of riches and abundance. She was too prudent,\r\nhowever, to impart to any of the fairy people the discovery she had\r\nmade, and, the health of the child being quite restored, solicited\r\nher dismissal, which was granted her with many thanks, and a handsome\r\ncompensation for her trouble.\r\n\r\nThe Saturday following her return to the light of day, she went into\r\ntown to make her weekly purchases of provisions and other necessaries,\r\nand, stepping into a shop in the Haut Pavé, was astonished to see one\r\nof her acquaintances of the Creux des Fâïes busily employed in filling\r\na basket with the various commodities exposed for sale, but evidently\r\nunseen by all in the shop but herself. No longer at a loss to know\r\nwhence the abundance in the fairies’ cavern proceeded, and, indignant\r\nat the roguery practised on the unsuspecting shopkeeper, she addressed\r\nthe pilferer and said “Ah, wicked one! I see thee!”\r\n\r\n“You see me--do you?” answered the fairy. “And how--pray?”\r\n\r\n“With my eyes to be sure,” replied the woman, off her guard.\r\n\r\n“Well then,” replied he, “I will easily put a stop to any future prying\r\ninto our affairs on your part.”\r\n\r\nAnd, saying this, he spat in her eyes, and she instantly became stone\r\nblind![101]\r\n\r\n[101] From Miss Lane, as related in the Castel parish.\r\n\r\nThere is another version of the preceding, called\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAIRIES AND THE MIDWIFE.\r\n\r\nLate one night an old woman was called up by a man with whom she was\r\nunacquainted, and requested to follow as quickly as possible, as his\r\nwife was in labour and required her immediate assistance. She obeyed,\r\nand was led by her guide into a miserable hovel, where everything\r\nappeared wretched, the few articles of furniture falling to pieces,\r\nand the household vessels of the coarsest ware, and scarcely one\r\nwhole. Shortly after her arrival, her patient was safely delivered of\r\na child. When she was about to make use of some water which stood in\r\na pail, to wash the child with, and had already dipped her hand into\r\nit, she was earnestly requested not to meddle with that water, but to\r\nuse some which stood in a jug close by. She chanced, however, to lift\r\nher hand, still wet, to her face, and a drop of the water got into one\r\nof her eyes. Immediately she saw everything under a different aspect;\r\nthe house appeared rich and magnificently furnished, and the broken\r\nearthenware turned into vessels of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nShe was, however, too prudent to express her surprise, and, when her\r\nservices were no longer required, left the place.\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards she met the man in town and accosted him. “What,”\r\nsaid he, “You see me! How is this?” Taken unawares, she mentioned what\r\nshe had done in the cottage, and which of her eyes was endowed with the\r\nfaculty of beholding him: he immediately spat in it, and destroyed her\r\nsight for ever.[102]\r\n\r\n[102] From Miss E. Chepmell.\r\n\r\nSee Sir Walter Scott’s _Lady of the Lake_.

See also\r\nTome 2., p. 89. “Un jour, une sage-femme alla accoucher une fée; elle\r\noublia de se laver la main, et se toucha un œil; ainsi depuis ce temps\r\nelle reconnaissait les déguisements des fées. Un jour que le mari de\r\nla fée était à voler du grain, elle le vit et cria ‘au voleur.’ Il lui\r\ndemanda de quel œil elle le voyait, et aussitôt qu’il le sut, il le lui\r\narracha.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROKEN KETTLE.\r\n\r\nTwo men were at work in a field near L’Erée, when suddenly their\r\nplough stopped, nor would their united strength, joined to that of\r\nthe oxen, succeed in moving it. As they looked about them, wondering\r\nwhat could be the reason of this stoppage, they observed in one of the\r\nneighbouring furrows an iron kettle, such as was formerly used for\r\nbaking bread and cake on the hearth. On approaching it they noticed\r\nthat it contained a bit which had been broken out of the side, and a\r\ncouple of nails. On stooping to lift it, they heard a voice desiring\r\nthem to get it mended, and when done to replace it on the same spot\r\nwhere they had found it. They complied with the request, went to the\r\nnearest smith, and on their return to the field with the kettle, which\r\nthey replaced as directed, continued their work, the plough moving as\r\nreadily as before. They had completed several furrows when a second\r\ntime the plough remained stationary. On this occasion they observed a\r\nbundle neatly tied up lying near them, and, on opening it, found it to\r\ncontain a newly-baked cake, quite warm, and a bottle of cider. At the\r\nsame time they were again addressed by their invisible friend, who bade\r\nthem eat and drink without fear, thanked them for the readiness with\r\nwhich they had attended to his wishes, and assured them that a kind\r\naction never goes without its reward.[103]\r\n\r\n[103] From Miss Lane.\r\n\r\nSee _Notes and Queries_, 2nd Series, Vol. IX., 259.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAIRY NEIGHBOURS.\r\n\r\nThe fairies are reported to have regarded some households with\r\nparticular favour, and to have lived on very neighbourly terms with\r\nthem, borrowing or lending as occasion might require.\r\n\r\nThe families of De Garis and Dumont are among those who are said to\r\nhave been in their good graces, and it was to a De Garis the following\r\nincident happened.\r\n\r\nTo the south of the Church of St. Pierre du Bois there lies a little\r\ndell, through which runs a small stream of water known by the singular\r\nname of “Le Douït d’Israël.” This valley is said to have been in\r\nformer days a favourite resort of the fairy folk, and tradition\r\naffirms that a very kindly feeling existed between them and the\r\nmortal inhabitants of the land. A cottage is still pointed out, not\r\nfar from the estate called “Le Colombier,” which is said to have been\r\nthe abode of a countryman and his wife with whom the fairies were in\r\nconstant communication. Frequently, at night, the elves would come and\r\nrequest the loan of a cart until the morning, and their request was\r\nalways complied with willingly, for it was always accompanied with the\r\nfollowing promise:--\r\n\r\n                _“Garis, Garis,_\r\n    _Prête mé ten quériot,_\r\n    _Pour que j’allons à St. Malo,_\r\n    _Queurre des roques et des galots,_\r\n    _Rindelles, roulettes, ou roulons,_\r\n    _S’il en mànque j’en mettrons.”_\r\n\r\n                (“Garis, Garis,\r\n    Lend your cart now, I pray,\r\n    To go to Saint Malo,\r\n    To fetch stones away.\r\n    Should tires for the wheels\r\n    Or any thing lack,\r\n    We’ll make it all right\r\n    Before we come back.”)\r\n\r\nPermission to take the cart was never refused, for it was always\r\nreturned in perfect order, and, if any injury was done to the\r\nmetal-work during the nocturnal journey, it was found the next day\r\ncarefully repaired with pure silver. But what use was made of it is\r\nunknown. Some pretend that a sound of wheels was sometimes heard in\r\nthe dead of night rolling over the cliffs at Pleinmont, where no horse\r\ncould have found a footing.[104]\r\n\r\n[104] From John de Garis, Esq., and Mrs. Savidan.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LE PETIT COLIN.”\r\n\r\nFairies have sometimes been known to enter into the service of mankind,\r\nbut by what motives they were actuated in so doing is not clear. A\r\ncertain “Mess”[105] Dumaresq, of “Les Grands Moulins,” once engaged as\r\na farm servant a boy who offered himself. No one knew whence he came,\r\nnor did he appear to have any relations. He was extremely lively,\r\nactive, and attentive to his duties, but so small that he acquired and\r\nwas known by no other name than that of “P’tit Colin.” One morning\r\nas Dumaresq was returning from St. Saviour’s, he was astonished, on\r\npassing the haunted hill known as “La Roque où le Coq Chante,” to hear\r\nhimself called by name. He stopped his horse and looked round, but\r\ncould see no one. Thinking that his imagination must have deceived him,\r\nhe began to move on, but was again arrested by the voice. A second time\r\nhe stopped and looked round, but with no more success than the first.\r\nBeginning to feel alarmed, he pushed his horse forward, but was a third\r\ntime stopped by the voice. He now summoned up all his courage and\r\nasked who it was that called, and what was required of him. The voice\r\nimmediately answered,--\r\n\r\n“Go home directly and tell P’tit Colin that Grand Colin is dead.”\r\n\r\nWondering what could be the meaning of this, he made the best of his\r\nway home, and, on his arrival, sent for Le Petit Colin, to whom he\r\ncommunicated what had befallen him. The boy replied, “What! Is Le\r\nGrand Colin dead? Then I must leave you,” and immediately turned round\r\nto depart.\r\n\r\n“Stop,” said Mess Dumaresq, “I must pay you your wages.”\r\n\r\n“Wages!” said Colin, with a laugh, “I am far richer now than you.\r\nGoodbye.”\r\n\r\nSaying this he left the room and was never afterwards seen or heard of.\r\n\r\nThis story is still related by Dumaresq’s descendants.[106]\r\n\r\n[105] “Mess” is the Guernsey colloquial for “Monsieur,” as applied to\r\none of the farmer class.\r\n\r\n[106] From Miss Lane and John de Garis, Esq.\r\n\r\nMr. Métivier also gives a version of this in an article in one of the\r\nFrench papers, and some notes as to the origin of the legend.\r\n\r\nCe fut à son retour de St. Pierre-Port, où il avait un tant soit peu\r\ntrop levé le coude, un Samedi, qu’au moment où il passait “La Roche au\r\nCoq,” vers minuit, un de nos terriens entendit ces paroles:\r\n\r\n“Jean Dumaresq! Va dire au P’tit Colin que l’Grànd Colin est mort!”\r\n\r\nOr ce Colin, en haut-tudesque _Cole-wire_, est un _troll_ ou _guenon_,\r\nun gobelin, qui, sous la forme de singe, ou de chat, était persécuté\r\npar un maître rébarbatif. Dans la légende norse, le fermier se nomme\r\nPlatt; et lorsqu’il revient chez lui, ayant pris, sinon du vin, de la\r\ncervoise, il dit à sa ménagère: “Écoute ce qui m’est arrivé ce soir!\r\nComme je passais Brand Hoy, la Hougue-aux-Balais, la voix d’un troll\r\nm’a crié ces mots:\r\n\r\n    “Écoute, Platt!\r\n    Dis à ton chat\r\n    ‘Que le vieux Sure-Mûre,\r\n    (Rouâne et grond),\r\n    Est mort!’”\r\n\r\nAussitôt, notre chat fait une cabriole, et se dressant sur ses pieds de\r\nderrière, crie à son tour: “En ce cas-là, il faut que je décampe.””\r\n\r\nSee _Lay of the Last Minstrel_, Note S, and a paper on Popular\r\nSuperstitions, etc., in the _Saturday Magazine_, Vol 10. p. 44. In\r\nBrand’s _Antiquities_, Vol. 3. p. 44, the following similar story is\r\ncommunicated by T. Quiller Couch, as relating to a Cornish pixy. “A\r\nfarmer, who formerly lived on an estate in this neighbourhood, called\r\nLangreek, was returning one evening from a distant part of the farm,\r\nand, in crossing a field, saw, to his surprise, sitting on a stone in\r\nthe middle of it, a miserable looking creature, human in appearance,\r\nthough dwarfish in size, and apparently starving with cold and hunger.\r\nPitying its condition, and perhaps aware that it was of elfish origin,\r\nand that good luck would amply repay him for his kind treatment of\r\nit, he took it home, placed it by the warm hearth on a stool, fed it\r\nwith milk, and shewed it great kindness. Though at first lumpish and\r\nonly half sensible, the poor bantling soon revived, and, though it\r\nnever spoke, became lively and playful, and a general favourite in the\r\nfamily. After the lapse of three or four days, whilst it was at play,\r\na shrill voice in the farm-yard or ‘town place’ was heard to call\r\nthree times ‘Colman Gray!’ at which the little fellow sprang up, and,\r\ngaining voice, cried--‘Ho! Ho! Ho! My daddy is come!’ flew through the\r\nkey hole, and was never afterwards heard of. A field on the estate is\r\ncalled “Colman Gray” to this day.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAIRY BAKERS.\r\n\r\nLe Grand Colin and Le Petit Colin, whose names have already been\r\nmentioned in connection with La Longue Roque and La Roque où le Coq\r\nChante, appear to have belonged to that race of household spirits who\r\nused to take up their abode on or near the hearth, and who, although\r\nrarely making themselves visible to the human inhabitants of the house,\r\nwere willing, so long as no attempt was made to pry into their secrets,\r\nto render occasional acts of kindness to those under whose roof they\r\ndwelt, especially if they were honest and industrious.\r\n\r\nA man and his wife occupied a small cottage at St. Brioc. The man\r\ngained his living as many along the western coasts of the island do.\r\nWhen the weather was favourable he went out fishing. After gales of\r\nwind he was up with the first dawn of day to secure his share of the\r\nsea-weed which the waves had cast up on the shore, or perchance a spar\r\nor cordage detached from some unfortunate ship that had gone down in\r\nthe storm. At other times he cultivated his own small plot of ground,\r\nor hired himself out as a day labourer to some of the neighbouring\r\nfarmers who were in want of assistance. In short he was never idle.\r\n\r\nThey lived in a typical old Guernsey country farm-house, with old\r\nwalls of grey granite, a thatched roof, small diamond-paned windows,\r\nand arched doorways, with its half-door or “hecq.” Inside they are all\r\nbuilt much on the same pattern. The front door opens into an entrance\r\nhall, on one side of which is the “living” room of the house,--parlour\r\nand kitchen in one,--with a huge chimney, sometimes adorned with quaint\r\nold carvings, as at “Les Fontaines,” in the Castel parish, a low hearth\r\nstone, a smouldering vraic fire, and “trepied.” Still inside its\r\nenclosure are stone seats, a large bread oven built in the thickness of\r\nthe wall, and a hook whereon to hang the “crâset” lamp.\r\n\r\nA rack hangs from the low oak ceiling, diversified by its huge centre\r\nbeam or “poûtre.” On this is kept the bacon, and the grease for the\r\n“soupe à la graisse,” or “de cabôche.” A “jonquière,” which is an\r\noblong wooden frame about three feet from the ground, is placed in a\r\ncorner near the fire and if possible near a window, and is used as a\r\nsofa by the family. Formerly it was stuffed with rushes, whence its\r\nname. Peastraw or dried fern, covered with green baize, now take their\r\nplace, and it is frequently called the “green bed.” A long table and\r\nforms, with an eight-day clock by Naftel, Lenfestey, or Blondel, and an\r\nold carved chest, which contained the bride’s dower of linen in bygone\r\ntimes, is the ordinary furniture of the rooms, whose principal ornament\r\nconsists of some of the beautiful china brought by sailor sons from\r\nthe far East or Holland. The floors boast for carpet nothing but earth\r\ncovered with clean sand, daily renewed.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the passage is the best bedroom, with its four\r\nposter, and some still have on their mantel-pieces the old tinder\r\nboxes, with their flint and steel, and separate compartments for the\r\nburnt rag or tinder. Beyond are the winding stone steps, built in\r\na curve beyond the straight wall of the house, and above are more\r\nbedrooms, or, in smaller houses, simply a “ch’nas” or loft.\r\n\r\nHis wife also was never idle. She was one of the shrewd, industrious,\r\nand frugal race, who were content with a diet of bacon and cabbage,\r\nbarley-bread and cider, and who are, alas, disappearing fast. Night\r\nafter night, when her husband had returned home, and, tired out with\r\nthe fatigues of the day, had gone to rest and was sound asleep, she\r\nwould sit up till a late hour on the “jonquière” and ply her spinning\r\nwheel by the dim light of the “crâset.”\r\n\r\nWhile thus occupied, she, one night, heard a knock at the door, and\r\na voice enquiring whether the oven was hot, and whether a batch of\r\ndough might be baked in it. A voice from within then enquired who it\r\nwas that stood without, and, on the answer being given that it was Le\r\nPetit Colin, permission was immediately granted, and the door opened to\r\nadmit him. She then heard the noise of the dough being placed in the\r\noven, and a conversation between the two, by which she learned that the\r\ninmate of the house was called Le Grand Colin. After the usual time the\r\nbread was drawn, and the mysterious visitor departed, leaving behind\r\nhim, on the table, a nicely baked cake, with an intimation that it was\r\nin return for the use of the oven.\r\n\r\nThis was repeated frequently and at regular intervals, and the woman\r\nat last mentioned the circumstance to her husband. The fairer sex is\r\nfrequently accused of an inclination to pry into secrets and taunted\r\nwith the evils which too often result from inordinate curiosity, but in\r\nthis instance it was the husband who was to blame. He was seized with\r\na violent desire to penetrate the mystery, notwithstanding the earnest\r\nentreaties of his wife--who had a shrewd suspicion of the real state of\r\nthe case--that he should leave well alone. His will prevailed, and it\r\nwas settled that on the night when the invisible baker was expected,\r\nthe husband should take his wife’s place on the “jonquière,” disguised\r\nin her clothes, and that she should go to bed. Knowing that her husband\r\ncould not spin, the careful housewife thought it prudent not to put\r\nthe usual supply of flax or wool on the distaff, lest the good man, in\r\nturning the wheel, should spoil it. He had not been long at his post\r\nand pretending to spin, when the expected visitor came. He could see\r\nnothing, but he heard one of the two say to the other:--\r\n\r\n    _“File, filiocque,_\r\n    _Rien en brocque,_\r\n    _Barbe à cé ser_\r\n    _Pas l’autre ser.”_\r\n\r\n    (“There’s flax on the distaff,\r\n    But nothing is spun;\r\n    To night there’s a beard,\r\n    T’other night there was none.”)\r\n\r\nUpon which both were heard to quit the house as if in anger, and were\r\nnever again known to revisit it.[107]\r\n\r\n[107] From William Le Poidevin, confirmed by Mrs. Savidan.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nCompare in Amélie Bosquet’s book _La Normandie Romanesque et\r\nMerveilleuse_, p. 130-131, _Le Lutin ou le Fé Amoureux_ and Webster’s\r\n_Basque Legends_, p. 55-56.\r\n\r\nPaul Sébillot also gives a somewhat similar story, in _Traditions et\r\nSuperstitions de La Haute Bretagne_, Tome 1., p. 116-117. “Il y avait\r\nà la Ville-Douélan, en la paroisse du Gouray, une bonne femme qui tous\r\nles soirs mettait son souper à chauffer dans le foyer; mais pendant\r\nqu’elle était occupée à filer, les fées descendaient par la cheminée\r\net mangeaient son souper. Elle s’en plaignit à son mari, qui était\r\njournalier et ne rentrait que pour se coucher. Il lui dit de le laisser\r\nun soir tout seul à la maison. Il s’habilla en femme et prit une\r\nquenouille comme une fileuse, mais il ne filait point. Quand les fées\r\narrivèrent, elles s’arrêtèrent surprises dans le foyer et dirent, ‘Vous\r\nne filez ni ne volez, vous n’êtes pas la bonne femme des autres soirs.’\r\nL’homme ne répondit rien; mais il prit une trique et se mit à frapper\r\nsur les fées, qui, depuis ce temps-là, ne revinrent plus jamais.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGELING.\r\n\r\nIn times long past a young couple occupied a cottage in the\r\nneighbourhood of L’Erée. They were in the second year of their\r\nmarriage, and little more than a fortnight had elapsed since the wife\r\nhad presented her husband with his first-born son. The happy father,\r\nwho, like most of the inhabitants of the coast, filled up the time in\r\nwhich he was not otherwise occupied, in collecting sea-weed or fishing,\r\nreturned one morning from the beach with a basketful of limpets. There\r\nare various ways of cooking this shell-fish, which, from the earliest\r\ntimes, appears to have formed a considerable article of food among the\r\npoorer inhabitants of the sea-shore, and one of the ways of dressing\r\nthem is by placing them on the hot embers, where they are soon baked or\r\nfried in their own cup-shaped shells. Cooked in this manner they form\r\nan appetizing relish to the “dorâïe,” or slice of bread-and-butter,\r\nwhich forms the ordinary mid-day meal of the labouring man.\r\n\r\nA good fire of furze and sea-weed was flaming on the hearth when the\r\nman entered his cottage, and, having raked the hot embers together, he\r\nproceeded to arrange the limpets on the ashes, and then left them to\r\ncook while he went out to finish digging a piece of ground. The wife in\r\nthe meanwhile was occupied in some domestic work, but casting a look\r\nfrom time to time on her new-born babe, which was sleeping quietly in\r\nits cradle. Suddenly she was startled by hearing an unknown voice,\r\nwhich seemed to proceed from the child. She turned quickly round, and\r\nwas much surprised to see the infant sitting up, and looking with the\r\ngreatest interest at the fire-place, and to hear it exclaim in tones of\r\nastonishment:--\r\n\r\n    _“Je n’sis de chut an, ni d’antan,_\r\n    _Ni du temps du Rouey Jehan,_\r\n    _Mais de tous mes jours, et de tous mes ans,_\r\n    _Je n’ai vu autant de pots bouaillants.”_\r\n\r\n    (“I’m not of this year, nor the year before,\r\n    Nor yet of the time of King John of yore,\r\n    But in all my days and years, I ween,\r\n    So many pots boiling I never have seen.”)\r\n\r\nShe had heard old wives tell how the fairies sometimes took advantage\r\nof the absence of the mother or nurse, to steal away a sleeping child,\r\nand to substitute one of their own bantlings in its place, and how the\r\nonly way to cause them to make restitution was to throw the changeling\r\non the hearth, when the fairy mother, unable to withstand the piteous\r\ncries of her offspring, was sure to appear, and bring back the stolen\r\ninfant with her.\r\n\r\nShe lost no time therefore in catching up the fairy imp, who, knowing\r\nthe fate that awaited him, set up a fearful yell. Immediately, the\r\nfairy mother, without stopping to lift the latch, leaped over the\r\n“hecq” or half-door, and, restoring to the trembling housewife her babe\r\nuninjured, snatched up her own squalling brat, and departed by the same\r\nway she had come.[108]\r\n\r\n[108] From Mrs. Savidan. (Also see Page 225).\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING OF THE CASTEL CHURCH.\r\n\r\nThe parish of Notre Dame du Castel, or, as it is now the fashion\r\nto call it, St. Mary de Castro, is the largest in the island, but\r\nthe church is situated at one extremity of the parish, close on the\r\nbounds of St. Andrew’s, to the great inconvenience of many of the\r\nparishioners. It is true that in former days they had some relief in\r\nthe Chapels of Ste. Anne, St. George, and St. Germain, but chapels are\r\nnot parish churches, and many, while trudging through the miry roads in\r\nwinter, or toiling up the dusty hill in summer, when some of the great\r\nfestivals required them to present themselves at the mother church,\r\nhave inquired how it came to pass that so inconvenient a site had been\r\nchosen. The old people, depositaries of the ancient traditions of the\r\nplace, will answer that originally the foundations were laid in a\r\nfield called “Les Tuzés,” but this was haunted ground, and a favourite\r\nresort of the fairies, and that, these little ladies, unwilling to\r\nyield up their rights without a struggle, in the course of a single\r\nnight transported all the tools, stones, etc., in their cambric aprons,\r\nto the spot where the Church of St. Mary now stands. Thrice did this\r\nhappen before the builders gave up their intention of erecting the\r\nsacred edifice on the site first chosen.[109]\r\n\r\n[109] From Rachel Duport.\r\n\r\nSimilar stories are told of the Forest Church, of St. Martin’s and the\r\nVale Churches, of St. Brelade’s in Jersey, and many others.\r\n\r\nSee Chambers’ _Popular Rhymes of Scotland_, p. 335, and _Notes and\r\nQueries_, 2nd Series, IV., 144.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUERNSEY LILY.\r\n\r\nThere is another story told of the fairy man who first came to Guernsey\r\nand carried away the beautiful Michelle de Garis[110] to be his wife.\r\nThough, vanquished by his courtliness and grace, she was persuaded to\r\nfly with him back to fairy land, she could not quite forget the father,\r\nmother, and brothers, whom she had left behind her in their cottage\r\ndown by Vazon Bay. So she begged him to let her leave them some slight\r\ntoken by which to remember her. He thought for a few moments, and then\r\ngave her a bulb, which he told her to plant in the sand above the bay.\r\nHe then whispered to the mother where to go to find a souvenir of her\r\nmissing daughter, and, when she went, weeping, to the search, she found\r\nthis bulb, burst into flower, a strange odourless beautiful blossom,\r\ndecked with fairy gold, and without a soul--for what is the scent but\r\nthe soul of a flower--a fit emblem of a denizen of fairyland. From\r\nthat time the flower has been carefully cultivated in this island, the\r\n“Amaryllis Sarniensis,” as it is called, nor will it flourish, however\r\ngreat the care, in any of the other islands; it pines and degenerates\r\nwhen removed from the soil where it was first planted by the elfin\r\nlover.[111]\r\n\r\n[110] In those days Guernsey girls were not called Lavinia, Maud,\r\nGladys, and all the ridiculous names with which modern parents\r\ndisfigure the old Norman surnames, but they were called Michelle,\r\nPeronelle,--the diminutive feminine of Pierre, equivalent to the\r\nEnglish form Petronilla,--Renouvette, (feminine of Ranulf or Ralph),\r\nOriane, Carterette, Jaqueline, Colette or Colinette, and many other\r\nsoft graceful old French names.\r\n\r\n[111] From Miss Lane.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\n“LE GIBET DES FAÏES.”\r\n\r\nThis fairy-story is not included by Sir Edgar MacCulloch, but was\r\ncommunicated to me by the late Miss Annie Chepmell, who most kindly\r\nlent me her own manuscript book, in which she wrote down the legends\r\nshe had herself collected among the country people. I give it in her\r\nown words.\r\n\r\n“For a long time the fairies alone had possession of L’Ancresse, the\r\ncromlechs, hougues, and caves. But evil men rose up, and ambition and\r\nthe lust of knowledge led them to cross the sea, and there to learn\r\nthe mighty art of magic. They returned and quickly spread the sin of\r\nwitchcraft in the island, so quickly that the harmless fairies had no\r\ntime to accustom themselves to the miseries which were caused thereby,\r\nand which they had no power to remedy. Their hearts fairly broke to\r\nsee their happy haunts invaded by witches and wizards, their fairy\r\nrings trampled down by the heavy feet of ‘sorcières,’ and scorched by\r\nthe hoofs of their demon partners every Friday night; and their human\r\nfriends and pet animals pining beneath charms and spells. Unable to\r\nbear these sorrows, the poor fairies met on their beloved L’Ancresse,\r\nand finding, after much consultation, that they could do nothing\r\nagainst the disturbers of their happiness, they sadly resolved to get\r\nrid of their past by drinking of the fountain of forgetfulness. There\r\nis, or rather was,--for the ruthless quarries have much diminished its\r\nsize--a huge pile of rocks rising from the sea at the eastern extremity\r\nof L’Ancresse Bay. At the very top of this granite castle rises a\r\nlittle fountain, cool in the hottest summer, unfrozen in the keenest\r\nfrost. Its waters have the properties of Lethe--those who drink of\r\nthem forgetting the past. In a sad procession the fairy tribe moved\r\nacross the bay, and, after having scaled the steep rocks, clustered\r\nround the fountain which was to give them the bliss of unconsciousness.\r\nBut for them the fountain had no virtue; they drank, and still the\r\npast came back, with all its joys and sorrows. In despair at finding\r\neven oblivion denied to them, they hastily determined to get rid of\r\nlife itself. Rushing down the rocks they hurried across the Common\r\nto where stood three tall upright stones, with a third resting upon\r\nthem--a monument of far-off Druid times--and there they hung themselves\r\nwith blades of grass. So ended the kindly race in Guernsey, the fairy\r\nfountain and the upright stones their only monuments.”\r\n\r\n“There are still a few lingering remnants of fairy lore to be found\r\namong the old country people. Old Miss Fallaize, aged eighty, remembers\r\nhow, in her youth, eatables and drinkables were left outside the door\r\nwith any unfinished work, and how in the morning the food was gone--but\r\nshe could not quite remember whether the work was done. But old Mr.\r\nTourtel, over eighty, who was brought up as a boy at an old house at\r\nthe Mont Durand, now pulled down, said that it was well known that the\r\nfairies lived in a ‘vôte’ (a Guernsey word for the French ‘voute,’ a\r\nvaulted cave), above La Petite Porte. They were a little people, but\r\nvery strong, and would mend your cart wheels or spokes for you if you\r\nwould put out some food for them.”\r\n\r\nAlso the woman living in the house called “St. Magloire” opposite the\r\nsite of his old chapel, said she supposed “Monsieur Magloire” was the\r\nfirst _man_ who came to these islands, and when I asked her who were\r\nliving here when he came, she said “Oh, ‘little people,’ who lived in\r\nthe cromlechs.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMermaids.\r\n\r\n    “I’ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall.”\r\n\r\n                                     --_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n                        “Thou rememb’rest\r\n    Since once I sat upon a promontory,\r\n    And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back,\r\n    Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,\r\n    That the rude sea grew civil at her song.”\r\n\r\n                              --_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\nA belief in the existence of mermaids is not quite extinct, although no\r\ntales relating to them appear to have been preserved among the people.\r\nAn old man, living in the parish of the Forest, of the name of Matthieu\r\nTostevin, whose word might be implicitly relied on, affirmed to Mr.\r\nDenys Corbet, the master of the parochial school, that on one occasion,\r\nbeing on the cliffs over-looking Petit-Bôt Bay, he saw a company of six\r\nmermaids, or, as he termed them “_seirênes_,” disporting themselves on\r\nthe sands below. He described them as usually depicted, half woman,\r\nhalf fish. He hastened down to the beach as fast as he could, to get a\r\nnearer sight of them, but, on his approaching them, they took to the\r\nsea, and were immediately out of sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Looking down Smith Street, 1870.”]\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless a flock of seals which he saw, for, although these\r\nanimals are no longer found in numbers on our coasts, a stray one is\r\noccasionally, though very rarely, to be seen. They are known to exist\r\non the opposite shores of Brittany and Normandy, and the few specimens\r\nthat have been taken in our seas are of the same variety as those found\r\non the French coast. It is not improbable that they may have been more\r\ncommon in former days; and it is possible that “Le Creux du Chien,” a\r\nlarge cavern at the foot of the cliffs to the eastward of Petit-Bôt\r\nBay, may have been so named from being the resort of one of these\r\namphibians.[112]\r\n\r\n[112] From Mr. Denys Corbet.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--In Sark as well as in Guernsey they still believe in\r\nsirens, and an old man there, who had been a fisherman in his youth,\r\ntold me of these women who used to sit on the rocks and sing before a\r\nstorm. In Sark they are considered young and beautiful, but Guernsey\r\nfishermen talk of _old_ women who sit on the rocks and sing, and the\r\nships are brought closer to the rocks by the curiosity of those on\r\nboard to hear this mysterious music, and then the storm comes, and the\r\nships go to pieces on the rocks, and the sirens,--whether young or\r\nold,--carry down the sailors to the bottom of the sea, and eat them. So\r\nthe tradition goes.\r\n\r\nReferring to the legend of the Changeling, as related on pages 219-220,\r\nPaul Sébillot also tells a story very similar to this. Tome I. p.\r\n118-119.\r\n\r\nUn jour une femme dit à sa voisine,--“Ma pauvre commère, je crains que\r\nmon gars a été changé par les Margots … j’voudrais bien savoir c’qui\r\nfaut faire.”\r\n\r\n“ … Vous prendrez d’s œufs; vous leur casserez le petit bout, et puis\r\nd’cela vous mettrez des petits brochiaux d’bois dedans; vous allumerez\r\nun bon feu; vous les mettrez autour, debout; et vous mènerez le petit\r\nfaitiau à se chauffer aussi.”\r\n\r\nLa femme fit tout cela, et quand le petit faiteau vit les œufs bouillir\r\net les petits bois sauter dedans, il s’écria:\r\n\r\n    “Voilà que j’ai bientôt cent ans;\r\n    Mais jamais de ma vie durant\r\n    Je n’ai vu tant de p’tits pots bouillants.”\r\n\r\nLa femme vit tout de suite que son enfant avait été changé … et elle\r\ns’écria:\r\n\r\n--“Vilain petit sorcier, je vas te tuer!”\r\n\r\nMais la fée qui était dans le grenier lui cria--\r\n\r\n    “N’tue pas le mien, j’ne tuerai l’tien;\r\n    N’tien pas l’mien, j’te ren’rai l’tien.”\r\n\r\nSee also Amélie Bosquet, p. 116, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDemons and Goblins.\r\n\r\n    “Now I remember those old woman’s words\r\n    Who in my youth would tell me winter’s tales,\r\n    And speak of sprites and ghosts that glide by night\r\n    About the place where treasure hath been hid.”\r\n\r\n                              _Marlow’s “Jew of Venice.”_\r\n\r\n    “Will-a-wisp misleads night-faring clowns,\r\n    O’er hills and sinking bogs.”\r\n\r\n                            “Let night-dogs tear me,\r\n    And goblins ride me in my sleep to jelly,\r\n    Ere I forsake my sphere.”\r\n\r\n             --_Thierry and Theodoret. Act 1. Sc. 1._\r\n\r\n\r\nLE FAEU BÉLENGIER.\r\n\r\nThat singular meteor, known by the English as Jack o’Lantern or “Will\r\no’ the Wisp,” by the French as “Feu Follet,” and by the Bretons as\r\n“Jan gant y tan” (John with the fingers or gloves of fire), bears\r\nin Guernsey the appellation of _Le Faeu Bélengier_--the fire of\r\nBélenger. According to Mr. Métivier “Bélenger” is merely a slight\r\nvariation of the name “Volunde” or “Velint”--Wayland, or Weyland\r\nSmith, the blacksmith of the Scandinavian gods. Bélenger was married\r\nto a Valkyrie, daughter of the Fates, so runs the old Norse legend.\r\nHe was, for the sake of some treasures belonging to him, or under his\r\nguardianship, carried away by a certain king as prisoner to an island,\r\nwhere the tyrant cut the sinews of his feet so as to prevent his\r\nrunning away, and then set him to work. Too clever, however, not to be\r\nable to compass his revenge, Bélenger managed to kill the two sons of\r\nthe despot, and fashioned their bones into vessels for the royal table.\r\nAnd then, having maltreated the princess, daughter of his quondam\r\nmaster, he flew away through the air, and the name Bélenger has become\r\nidentified in popular mythology with any especially clever worker in\r\nmetals. In English popular tradition the name of Bélenger becomes\r\ncontracted into Velint, or Wayland Smith, and, according to Sir Walter\r\nScott, “this Wayland was condemned to wander, night after night, from\r\ncromlech to cromlech, and belated travellers imagined that they then\r\nbeheld the fire from his forge issuing from marshes and heaths.” The\r\nnatives of Iceland, descended from our own paternal ancestors of the\r\ntenth century, say still of a clever craftsman that he is a “Bélengier”\r\nin iron.\r\n\r\nIn Guernsey they say it is a spirit in pain, condemned to wander,\r\nand which seeks to deliver itself from torment by suicide.[113] Its\r\npresence is also supposed to indicate in very many cases the existence\r\nof hidden treasures, and many a countryman is known to have made a\r\nfruitless journey over bog and morass in the hope of locating the\r\nflickering flame. It is also firmly believed by all the country people\r\nthat if a knife is fixed by the handle to a tree, or stuck in the earth\r\nwith the point upwards, the spirit or demon that guides the flame will\r\nattack and fight with it, and that proofs of the encounter will be\r\nfound next morning in the drops of blood found on the blade.[114]\r\n\r\n[113] See Métivier’s Dictionary,--Art: Bélengier.\r\n\r\n[114] From Rachel Du Port, and others.\r\n\r\nYorkshire Folk-Lore--_Notes and Queries_, 4th Series, I; 193. “If\r\never you are pursued by a Will-o’-the-Wisp, the best thing to do is\r\nto put a steel knife into the ground, with the handle upwards. The\r\nWill-o’-the-Wisp will run round this until the knife is burnt up, and\r\nyou will thus have the means of escaping.”\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\n“Tout le monde connaît ces exhalaisons de gaz inflammable qui brillent\r\nquelquefois dans les endroits marécageux et qui effraient tant les\r\nenfants et les vieilles. Ces feux sont appelés dans nos campagnes La\r\nFourlore, le feu follet, ou le feu errant. Ce sont des âmes damnées;\r\net, suivant quelques personnes, ces âmes sont celles de prêtres\r\ncriminels ou libertins. Elles cherchent à éblouir les voyageurs, à\r\nles entrainer dans les précipices, et à les jeter dans l’eau.

A. Bosquet, pp. 135-143.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDDEN TREASURES.\r\n\r\nAs we have already stated “Le Faeu Bélengier” is supposed to indicate\r\nthe existence of hidden treasure, and it is well known that when\r\ntreasures have been hidden for any considerable time the evil spirit\r\nacquires a property in them, and does all in his power to prevent their\r\nfalling into the possession of mortals. Nevertheless the meteor-like\r\nform which the Bélengier assumes, frequently betrays their place of\r\nconcealment as it plays about the spot, and if a person have sufficient\r\ncourage and perseverance he may become the possessor. The wiles,\r\nhowever, of the demon, and his efforts to retain his own, frequently\r\nprove successful, as the following narratives will testify. It appears,\r\nhowever, that the guardian spirit has no power to remove the treasure,\r\nunless the adventure have first been attempted by a mortal.\r\n\r\nA country-woman had often observed flames of fire issuing from and\r\nhovering round the earth within the threshold of her house, and,\r\nknowing well what they indicated, one day, when all the other\r\ninmates of the dwelling were in the fields busied in getting in the\r\nharvest, she determined on searching for the treasure. She procured a\r\npick-axe, closed and barred all the doors to secure herself against\r\ninterruptions, and proceeded to work. She had not dug long, before a\r\nviolent thunderstorm arose. Though alarmed, she continued her task,\r\nbut the rain, which now began to fall in torrents, drove the field\r\nlabourers to seek shelter in the house. By this time the woman had\r\nstruck on a brazen pan, which, she had no doubt, covered the treasure,\r\nand was in no hurry to open to the men who were clamouring at the door\r\nfor admission. She was at last obliged to yield to their entreaties,\r\nand, turning her back on the hole she had dug, unbarred the door. Her\r\ndismay was great, when, on looking back on her work, she saw the pan\r\nturned up, and the whole treasure abstracted. The demon had seized this\r\nopportunity to take possession of his own.\r\n\r\nA man had reason to believe, from the flames which he had seen hovering\r\nabout a certain spot, that a treasure was hidden there. Accordingly,\r\none night, he took his spade and lantern and dug till he came to a\r\nlarge jar, which contained what appeared to him to be shells.[115]\r\nSuspecting that this might be a stratagem of the evil spirit to deter\r\nhim from obtaining possession of the treasure, he carefully gathered\r\nup the whole, and took it home with him. On examining the parcel the\r\nnext morning, he found he had judged rightly, for the apparent shells\r\nof the preceding night had now resumed their original form of gold and\r\nsilver coin.\r\n\r\nAnother man was less fortunate, for, finding nothing but what he\r\nconceived to be shells, he hesitated about removing them, and was\r\neffectually deterred by the appearance of an immense animal, resembling\r\na black conger-eel with fiery eyes, coiled up in the hole which he had\r\ndug.[116]\r\n\r\n[115] It is perhaps to the fact that limpet shells are found in the\r\ncromlechs, which are always supposed to be the repository of hidden\r\ntreasure, that the idea that buried gold, when discovered by mortals,\r\nis transformed by its guardian spirit into worthless shells, is\r\nentertained by the peasantry.\r\n\r\n[116] From Rachel Du Port.\r\n\r\n“4 Oct. 1586.

Bosquet, p. 159-186.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE VAROU.”\r\n\r\nThe “Varou,” now almost entirely forgotten, seems to have belonged\r\nto the family of nocturnal goblins. He is allied to the “Loup-Garou”\r\nof the French, and the “Were-Wolf” of the English, if, indeed, he is\r\nnot absolutely identical with them. He is believed to be endowed with\r\na marvellous appetite, and it is still proverbially said of a great\r\neater “Il mange comme un varou.”[117]\r\n\r\n“Aller en varouverie” was an expression used in former times in\r\nspeaking of those persons who met together in unfrequented places for\r\nthe purposes of debauchery or other illicit practices. Among the Acts\r\nof the Consistory of the parish of St. Martin’s, in the time when the\r\nisland was still under the Presbyterian discipline, is to be found a\r\ncensure on certain individuals who had been heard to say one night that\r\nthe time was propitious “pour aller en varouverie sous l’épine.”\r\n\r\n_Varou_ was originally from the Breton _Varw_--“the dead”--and was\r\nidentified with the “Heroes” or beatified warriors, who were, by Homer\r\nand Hesiod, supposed to be in attendance on Saturn. Guernsey, in the\r\ndays of Demetrius, was known by the name of the Isle of Heroes, or of\r\nDemons, and Saturn was said to be confined there in a “golden rock,”\r\nbound by “golden chains.”\r\n\r\nThere is the “Creux des Varous,” which extends, according to tradition,\r\nfrom Houmet to L’Erée, and is a subterranean cavern formed of rock\r\nsprinkled with an abundance of yellow mica, which sparkles like gold;\r\na plot of ground near the cromlech at L’Erée, known as “Le Creux des\r\nFées,” still bears the name of “Le Camp du Varou;” and an estate in the\r\nparish of St. Saviour’s is called “Le Mont-Varou.” Old people remember\r\nthat it used to be said in their youth that “Le Char des Varous” was\r\nto be heard rolling over the cliffs and rocks on silver-tyred wheels,\r\nbetween Houmet and the Castle of Albecq, before the death of any of the\r\ngreat ones of the earth; and how this supernatural warning was sure to\r\nbe followed almost immediately by violent storms and tempests.[118]\r\n\r\n[117] “La veille de la fête de Noël, à nuit close, dans un lieu\r\npréscrit par le consentement de la communauté en Prusse, en Livonie,\r\net en Lithuanie, l’affluence des hommes changés en loups est telle que\r\nles ravages perpétrés cette nuit-là contre les bergers et les troupeaux\r\nsont beaucoup plus graves que ceux des véritables loups. S’insinuant\r\ndans les caves, ils y grenouillent et vous sablent plusieurs tonneaux\r\nde bière ou d’hydromel. Ils s’amusent alors à entasser les futailles\r\nvides au beau milieu du cellier. Le bon prélat ajoute, que de très\r\ngrands seigneurs ne dédaignent pas de s’agriger à cette confrèrie\r\nmaudite. C’est un des anciens adeptes qui initie l’aspirant _varou_ ou\r\n_garou_ dans une ample tasse de cervoise.” _Mœurs des Peuples du Nord_,\r\npar Olaus Magnus, Vol. VI., p. 46.\r\n\r\n[118] Mostly from Mr. George Métivier.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERODIAS.\r\n\r\nThe 10th of January, in Roman days, was dedicated to the _Fera Dea_, or\r\ncruel goddess, of which _Hero Dias_ is a literal Celtic interpretation\r\nhere. She is the queen of the witches, and although Satan himself is\r\nthe commander-in-chief of the witches, he has a mate who participates\r\nin his authority, and leads the dance when his votaries meet to\r\ncelebrate their midnight orgies at Catioroc or Rocquaine. This is no\r\nless a personage than the dissolute and revengeful woman by whose evil\r\ncounsel the holy precursor of our Saviour was put to death by Herod. To\r\nher, more particularly, is attributed the rising of sudden storms, and\r\nespecially of those which take the form of a whirlwind. It sometimes\r\nhappens that during the warm and sultry days of harvest a gust of\r\nwind will suddenly arise, and, whirling round the field, catch up and\r\ndisperse the ears of corn which the reaper has laid in due order for\r\nthe binder of the sheaves. The countryman doubts not but that this is\r\ncaused by Herodias shaking her petticoats in dancing--“_Ch’est la fille\r\nd’Hérode qui châque ses côtillons_,”--and he loses no time in hurling\r\nhis reaping hook in the direction she appears to be moving. It is said\r\nthat this has generally the effect of stopping the progress of the\r\nwhirlwind.\r\n\r\nThese sudden gusts are locally known by the name of “_héroguiâzes_,”\r\nand, although there is so easy a means of dispersing them as that\r\nindicated above, the man who would venture to throw his sickle or knife\r\nat them must be endowed with no small degree of courage.[119]\r\n\r\n[119] From Mr. George Métivier.\r\n\r\nFather Martin, the oracle of Gaulish divinity, has lavished floods\r\nof ink on Herodias. According to him she is the genius of the\r\nwhirlwind--the “mid-day,” as well as a mid-night, demon. Here she\r\ncontinues to “ride on the whirlwind,” and “direct the storm.” Instead\r\nof driving her away with holy water, as our Catholic neighbours do,\r\n_we_ fling a sickle at “La Vieille” with pious indignation, whenever\r\nthe eddying straws announce her arrival in the harvest-field.\r\n\r\nNear “Le Ras de Fontenay,” so infamous for its shipwrecks, the little\r\nisland of Sain, off Finistère, was dedicated to He’ro Dias. There she\r\npresided over the oracle of “Sena,” the Hag. Her priestesses were\r\nnine shrivelled hags, and their island derived its appellation from\r\nthe hag, their mistress. None but mariners, suitors for a bagful of\r\nfavourable wind, were admissible to the presence of these ladies, who\r\nspent their time “sur le rocher désert, l’effroi de la nature,” in a\r\nvery edifying manner--brewing storms, manufacturing hail, lightning,\r\nthunder, and so forth, and changing themselves into a variety of brutal\r\nforms--(Pomponius Mela).\r\n\r\nThat there is a two-headed serpent which caresses Dame Hérodias on a\r\nbas-relief of the temple of Mont-Morillon in Poitou, may be remembered\r\n_en passant_.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nAccording to the old Latin “Romaunt de Renard,” Herodias loved John\r\nthe Baptist. The jealous King caused him to be beheaded. His head, by\r\nher order, was carried to her, and she wished to kiss it, but the head\r\nturned away, and blew with so much violence that Herodias was blown\r\ninto the air. Since then, St. John, faithful to his antipathy, has made\r\nher travel for ever in the deserts of the sky, and become the genius of\r\nthe storm.\r\n\r\nSome confound her with “Habunde,” who may have been a white lady, or\r\none of those “genii” whom the Celts call “dusi.” _Chronique de Philippe\r\nMouskés_, Tome II. Introduction p. 139.\r\n\r\nSome also think that Herodias will, if anyone dances at harvest time,\r\nbring shipwreck and disasters at sea.--_From Mr. Isaac Le Patourel._\r\n\r\n\r\n“LE BARBOUE.”[120]\r\n\r\nThis was a demon used by old Guernsey nurses to frighten their infant\r\ncharges. “_Le Barboue t’attrappera_” was quite threat enough to make\r\nthe naughtiest child repent of his misdeeds. According to Mr. Métivier\r\n(See Dictionary, p. 51. _Barboue_), this name “Barboue” is a corruption\r\nof _bared meleu_, the spectre which personifies the plague among the\r\nCymri. According to the legends, “Barbaou Hervé” was the wolf who\r\naccompanied St. Hervé, a sainted hermit of the country of Léon, 560. He\r\nwas evidently related to the French “Loup-Garou.”\r\n\r\n[120] May not this be a corruption of _Barbe Bleue_--the Blue Beard who\r\nhas frightened so many children both in France and England?\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECTRAL APPEARANCES.\r\n\r\nMany places have the reputation of being haunted by phantoms which make\r\ntheir appearance at the dead of night, not always in a human form,\r\nas the spirits of the departed are wont to do when they revisit “the\r\nglimpses of the moon,” but in the more fearful shapes of beasts and\r\nnondescript monsters. “La Bête de la Tour,” “Le Cheval de St. George,”\r\nwhich has already been spoken of in connection with the well, and “Le\r\nChien Bôdu,” are among these.\r\n\r\nThe “devises,” or boundary stones, which served in olden times to mark\r\nthe limits of some of the principal “fiefs” or manors, but which have\r\nnow disappeared, leaving only a name to the locality, appear to have\r\nbeen the particular resort of these spectres; and it is not improbable\r\nthat the superstition may have arisen from the custom, of which traces\r\nare to be found in many nations, of sacrificing a victim and burying it\r\nwhere the stone of demarcation was to be set up. It was not, however,\r\nthese places only which became the haunt of spectres; other spots came\r\nin also for their share of these nocturnal and frightful visitors. A\r\nlonely dwelling, especially if uninhabited, a dark lane far from any\r\nfriendly cottage, cromlechs, or spots where these mysterious erections\r\nonce stood--all these either had, or were likely to acquire, an evil\r\nreputation in this respect, and more especially if tradition pointed to\r\nany deed of horror, such as murder or suicide, connected with the place\r\nor its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe headless dog which haunts the Ville-au-Roi, and which will be\r\nspoken of in the legend attached to that ancient domain, is an instance\r\nof these spectres. The best known of them is “Tchi-cô,” or the “Bête\r\nde la Tour,”--but there are also “La Bête de la Devise de Sausmarez à\r\nSaint Martin,” which is a black dog supposed to haunt the avenue by\r\nSausmarez Manor.[121]\r\n\r\n[121] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Then there is the “Rue de la Bête” at St.\r\nAndrew’s, on the borders of the Fief Rohais. Near this lane there was\r\nformerly a prison, so that it is probably full of associations of\r\ncrime and malefactors. There is also a “Rue de la Bête” near L’Erée,\r\nbetween “Claire Mare” and the Rouvets, where, to this day, people will\r\nnot go alone after dark, and they still tell the story (so wrote Miss\r\nLe Pelley, who lived in that neighbourhood), of a man, a M. Vaucourt,\r\nwho, driving down that lane in the dark, the “Bête” got up into the\r\ncart, which so scared the unfortunate man that he died the next day.\r\nThere was also a black dog which haunted the Forest Road, clanking its\r\nchains. The father of one old woman who told the story, saw and was\r\nfollowed by this beast one night when walking home from St. Martin’s to\r\nhis house near the Forest Church. He was so frightened that he took to\r\nhis bed and died of the shock very shortly afterwards. There is also\r\n“La Bête de la Rue Mase,” on the western limits of the Town parish, the\r\n“Coin de la Biche,” at St. Martin’s, between Saints’ and La Villette,\r\nand in the cross lane running from the “Carrefour David” to the\r\n“Profonds Camps,” past the house now called “St. Hilda,” a small white\r\nhare was supposed to be seen on stormy nights, accompanied by “Le Faeu\r\nBélengier.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“TCHI-CO, LA BÊTE DE LA TOUR.”\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that in early times the town of St. Peter Port was\r\nencircled by walls, and fortified--indeed there is an order of Edward\r\nIII. in 1350, authorising the levy of a duty on merchandise for this\r\npurpose. Certain spots, called “les barrières,” mark where the gates\r\nwere situated, and, although all remains of the walls have long since\r\ndisappeared, it is not difficult to trace the course they must have\r\ntaken. At the northern extremity of the original town, the name of “La\r\nTour Gand” indicates a fortress of some sort. The southern extremity\r\nwas protected by a work called “La Tour Beauregard,” of sufficient\r\nimportance to be named, together with Castle Cornet, in the warrants or\r\ncommissions issued by the monarch to those who were intrusted with the\r\ndefence of the island.\r\n\r\nThis fortress stood near the top of Cornet Street, on the brow of\r\nthe hill which overlooks the Bordage and Fountain Street, where now\r\nstands St. Barnabas’ Church. Tradition points to a spot at the foot of\r\nthe hill, as the place where the execution of heretics and witches,\r\nby burning, used to take place, and connects with these sad events\r\na spectral appearance which, even within the present century, was\r\nbelieved to haunt the purlieus of the old tower.\r\n\r\nDuring the long nights of winter, and especially about Christmastide,\r\nthe inhabitants of Tower-hill, the Bordage, Fountain Street, and Cornet\r\nStreet used to be roused from their midnight slumbers by hearing\r\nunearthly howlings and the clanking of heavy chains, dragged over the\r\nrough pavement.\r\n\r\nThose who could summon up courage enough to rise from their beds and\r\npeep out of window, declared that they saw the form of a huge uncouth\r\nanimal with large flaming saucer eyes, and somewhat like a bear, or\r\nhuge calf. This spectre was known as “Tchî-co, La Bête de la Tour.”\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nSee Pluquet in _Contes Populaires de Bayeux_, p. 16, for an account of\r\na phantom in the shape of a great dog that wanders about the streets of\r\nBayeux in the winter nights gnawing bones and dragging chains, called\r\n“Le Rongeur d’Os.”\r\n\r\nSee also Sir Walter Scott’s note in _Peveril of the Peak_, Vol. II.,\r\nChap. I., on the spectral hound or “Mauthe Doog”--a large black\r\nspaniel, which used to haunt Peel Castle in the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nThere is also in Laisnel de la Salle’s book _Croyances et Légendes du\r\nCentre de la France_, Tome I. p. 181, a long story of “Le Loup Bron,”\r\nwhich in many respects resembles that of our “Bête de la Tour.”\r\n\r\nIn Sark “they have another superstitious belief, that of the _Tchico_,\r\nor old dog, the dog of the dead, the black or white beast. Several\r\naffirm having seen it, and met it walking about the roads. This dog\r\naffects certain localities, and makes its regular rounds, but often it\r\nis invisible.” From _Descriptive Sketch of the Island of Sark_, by the\r\nRev. J. L. V. Cachemaille, published in Clarke’s _Guernsey Magazine_,\r\nVol. III., October. 1875.\r\n\r\nIn Brand’s _Antiquities_, Vol. III., p. 330, he identifies the English\r\n“Barguest,” or “Great Dog Fiend,” with the Norman “Rongeur d’Os,” and\r\nthe “Boggart” of Lancashire, great dog-spirits, which prowl about in\r\nthe night-time, dragging heavy chains behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LE CHIEN BÔDU.”\r\n\r\nThis black dog was said to infest the Clos du Valle, and was probably a\r\nresident of the Ville Bôdu, which was at one time the slaughter-house\r\nof the Benedictine monks of St. Michel du Valle. To see him was taken\r\nas a sure sign of approaching death. According to Mr. Métivier, he\r\nderived his name from “the German Bohdu, and Gaulish Bodu, which mean\r\nthe _Abyss_, and the mythological dog of Hades is our ‘Chien Bôdu.’”\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--In _Croyances et Légendes du Centre de la France_\r\nLaisnel de la Salle has a chapter (Tome I. pp. 168-175), on “La Chasse\r\na _Bôdet_,” which he describes as “une chasse nocturne qui traverse les\r\nairs avec des hurlements, des mieulements et des abois epouvantables,\r\nauxquels se mêlent des cris de menace et des accents d’angoisse,” and\r\nhe identifies (p. 172), “Bôdet” with the German _Woden_, who is the\r\nsame as the Scandinavian Odin, Gwyon of the Gauls, the Egyptian Thot,\r\nHermes of the Greeks, and Mercury of the Latins, who filled, in the\r\nTeutonic Mythology, the rôle of “Conductor of Souls.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGEND OF THE VILLE AU ROI.\r\n\r\nAlthough this story is known to everyone, and is to be found in all the\r\nlocal histories and guide books, no collection of Guernsey folk-lore\r\ncan be considered perfect without it. It is just one of those stories\r\nthat are calculated to make a profound impression on the popular mind,\r\nas showing the special interposition of Providence in preserving a poor\r\nand innocent man from the effects of a false accusation, and in causing\r\nthe nefarious designs of a rich and unprincipled oppressor to fall back\r\nwith just retribution on his own head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Old Manor, Ville au Roi.”]\r\n\r\nWhether the story be founded on an occurrence which did actually take\r\nplace in this island, whether it originated elsewhere, or whether\r\nit be a pure invention, it is now impossible to determine.[122] The\r\nname of the principal personage in the tale--Gaultier de la Salle--is\r\nto be found at the head of the lists of Bailiffs of Guernsey, with\r\nthe date 1284, but no written evidence has yet been adduced to prove\r\nthat anyone of the name ever held that office. There is, however,\r\nproof of a certain kind that a person bearing this name did exist at\r\nsome period of the fourteenth century, for, in a manuscript list of\r\nBailiffs, which appears to have been compiled about the year 1650,\r\nthe writer, who seems careful not to place any on record for whom he\r\ncannot produce documentary evidence, appends this note to the name of\r\nJohn Le Marchant, Bailiff from 1359 to 1383:--“J’en ay lettre de 1370\r\nconcernant la veuve Gaultier de la Salle.”\r\n\r\nThat no document is known to exist in which this name appears is no\r\nproof that Gaultier de la Salle did not hold the office. Previously\r\nto the reign of Edward I. it appears to have been the custom for the\r\nWarder or Governor of the island to appoint an officer with the title\r\nof Bailiff, who combined the functions of Lieutenant-Governor, chief\r\nmagistrate, and Receiver of the Crown Revenues, and who was generally\r\nchanged annually. The names of many of these dignitaries have been\r\npreserved, but there are still several blanks to be filled up, and it\r\nis not impossible that the name of Gaultier de la Salle may some day or\r\nother be found as holding this important charge, although probably at a\r\nlater date than that usually assigned to him--1284.\r\n\r\nThe estate of the Ville-au-Roi is said to have borne originally the\r\nname of “La Petite Ville.”[123] It has now dwindled down to a few\r\nfields, but was doubtless at one period of far greater extent and\r\nimportance than at the present time. The house, which may probably\r\nbe assigned to the fifteenth century, is now much diminished in size\r\nfrom what it was, even a few years since, but it still presents an\r\ninteresting specimen of the architecture of former days. It consisted,\r\nwhen perfect, of a building, forming two sides of a square, with\r\na tower in the angle, where may yet be seen the holes for arrows.\r\nIt contained a well-wrought newel staircase in stone, leading to a\r\nlarge room, which appears to have been the principal apartment in the\r\nhouse, if we may judge from the careful workmanship bestowed on the\r\nhandsomely carved granite chimney piece, the traces of stone mullions\r\nin the windows, and the ornamental open timber roof, now hidden by a\r\nlow ceiling. A wall of unusual thickness divides this portion of the\r\nbuilding into two parts; and a few steps from the head of the staircase\r\nof which we have spoken, lead to the remains of another newel resting\r\non this wall, which evidently formed part of a turret rising above the\r\nridge of the roof, and which could have served no purpose but that of\r\nornament, or perhaps a lookout over the neighbouring country. There\r\nare some detached farm buildings, and traces of a wall surrounding the\r\nhomestead, intended probably to form an inclosure into which the cattle\r\nmight be driven at night. The remains of an arched gateway at the end\r\nof the avenue, leading from the main road, and connecting the western\r\ngable of the dwelling house with an out-building, are still to be\r\ndiscerned. This was exactly opposite the principal door of the mansion,\r\nwhich is of good proportions, with a well-executed circular headway in\r\ngranite, over which is a square recess in the masonry which doubtless\r\nonce contained the armorial device of the original proprietor. There\r\nis reason to believe this was a member of the De Beauvoir family,\r\nonce very numerous and influential in the island but now extinct,\r\nfor it was well known that the family was formerly in possession of\r\nthis estate, and the existence of their arms--a chevron between three\r\ncinq-foils--carved in granite on the mantelpiece of the principal\r\nroom, is almost sufficient proof of one of the name having been the\r\noriginal builder of the house.[124] The estate afterwards passed into\r\nthe possession of the De la Marche family--also extinct. From them it\r\ndescended to a family of the name of Le Poidevin. These last falling\r\ninto pecuniary difficulties, the property by the legal process called\r\n“saisie” came into the hands of the present (1859) proprietor, Thomas\r\nLe Retilley, Esq., Jurat of the Royal Court.\r\n\r\nWhilst the recently-abolished manorial Court of the Priory of St.\r\nMichel du Valle still existed, there was a curious servitude attached\r\nto this estate. When this Court made its periodical procession through\r\nthe island to inspect the King’s highway and see that it was kept in\r\ndue repair, the proprietor of the Ville-au-Roi was expected to furnish\r\na cup of milk to everyone legally entitled to a place in the cortège,\r\nand the procession made a halt at the gate to demand the accustomed\r\nrefreshment, which was willingly afforded, although immemorial usage\r\nalone could be pleaded for the exaction.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to come to the legend itself. In the earliest records\r\nwhich the human race possesses--the Holy Scriptures--we read that\r\ndisputes arose about wells and the right of drawing water from them.\r\nWhere water is scarce, as it is in some parts of the East, this can\r\nreadily be understood, but why should any disagreement occur in\r\nplaces where this indispensable element abounds? The answer is simply\r\nthis. The well is for the most part the property of one person, and\r\nsituated on his ground, and those who claim a right to the use of it,\r\nmust necessarily pass over their neighbour’s land to get at it. It is\r\nclear that this right may be exercised in such a manner as to become\r\nvexatious and troublesome.\r\n\r\nGaultier de la Salle had a poor neighbour of the name of Massy, who\r\nwas the proprietor of a small field containing little more than a\r\nvergée of land at the back of the Bailiff’s house, but with this land\r\nhe possessed also the right,--no doubt by virtue of some ancient\r\nand binding contract--of drawing water from a well on De la Salle’s\r\nproperty. Often had the Bailiff offered to buy off this right,--to give\r\na fair and even liberal price for the piece of ground to which the\r\nprivilege was attached. Massy was obstinate. His answer to every offer\r\nwas that of Naboth to Ahab--“The Lord forbid it me that I should give\r\nthe inheritance of my fathers to thee.”\r\n\r\nAnnoyed at Massy’s pertinacious refusal to accede to his wishes,\r\nGaultier de la Salle formed the horrible design of taking away his\r\nlife, but how was this to be done without causing suspicion? Open\r\nviolence, even in those days, was not to be thought of. Secret\r\nassassination might be discovered. At last the acute mind of the\r\nunworthy Bailiff hit on an expedient which appeared to him perfectly\r\nsafe. It was to make the forms of the law subservient to his wicked\r\ndesigns, and, under the guise of a judicial proceeding, to cause the\r\nruin and death of the unfortunate Massy. Theft was then, and for too\r\nmany centuries after, punished with death. If he could succeed in\r\nfixing an accusation of this kind on the innocent Massy, he flattered\r\nhimself that there would be no difficulty in obtaining a conviction,\r\nand then would follow the utmost penalty of the law, and the consequent\r\nforfeiture of the felon’s lands and goods to the King, from whom he\r\nhoped to get a grant or sale of the field. To carry out his nefarious\r\nintention, he hid two of his own silver cups in a cornstack, and\r\nadroitly contrived to cause a suspicion of having stolen them to rest\r\non his too-obstinate neighbour. Circumstantial evidence, skilfully\r\ncombined, was not wanting on the day of trial, and, notwithstanding his\r\nvehement protestations of innocence, poor Massy was found guilty and\r\ncondemned to death. The day fixed for the execution arrived, and the\r\nBailiff proceeded to the Court House with the intention of witnessing\r\nthe death of the unfortunate victim of his own false accusation.\r\nBut “the wicked man diggeth a pit and falleth into the midst of it\r\nhimself.” Before leaving home, he gave orders to some of his workmen\r\nto take down a certain stack of corn, and house it in the barn. He had\r\nbarely taken his seat in Court, where the magistrates had assembled for\r\nthe purpose, as was then the custom, of attending the culprit to the\r\nplace of execution, and seeing their sentence duly carried out, when a\r\nmessenger, almost breathless, rushed in and exclaimed--\r\n\r\n“The cups are found.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Houses in Church Square, 1825.”]\r\n\r\n“Fool!” cried the Bailiff. “Did I not tell thee not to touch _that_\r\nrick. I knew----.” Here he stopped short in confusion, perceiving that\r\nhe had already said enough to raise the suspicions of those who had\r\nheard him.\r\n\r\nThe Jurats immediately gave orders to stay the execution. The matter\r\nwas submitted to a searching investigation, and resulted in a full\r\nexposure of the Bailiff’s nefarious plot. Thereupon Gaultier de la\r\nSalle was sentenced to suffer the same punishment that he had intended\r\nfor the innocent Massy, and his estate was declared to be confiscated\r\nto the King, since which time it has borne the appellation of “La\r\nVille-au-Roi.” It is said that he was hanged at a spot in the parish\r\nof St. Andrew’s, where, until the last century, executions[125]\r\nusually took place, and that, on his way to the gibbet, he stopped and\r\nreceived the Holy Sacrament at the foot of a cross, which, though long\r\ndestroyed, has given its name to the locality “La Croix au Baillif.”\r\nAn old lane bounding the land of the Ville-au-Roi on the north, and\r\nwhich was closed in the early part of last century, when the present\r\nhigh road was cut, bore the singular name of “La Rue de l’Ombre\r\nde la Mort.” It had naturally an evil reputation as the resort of\r\nphantoms and hobgoblins, and even in the present day it is with fear\r\nand trembling that the belated peasant in returning from town passes\r\nthe avenue of aged elms that leads up to the ruined mansion of the\r\niniquitous judge.\r\n\r\nMany will tell you how, at the witching hour of night, they have seen\r\na huge, headless black dog rush out and brush past them, and how those\r\nwho have been bold enough to strike at the phantom might as well have\r\nbeaten the air, for their cudgel met with no resistance from anything\r\ncorporeal. No one doubts that it is the unquiet spirit of Gaultier de\r\nla Salle, doomed to wander till the great day of judgment around the\r\nfield for the sake of which he was led into such deadly sin, happy\r\neven if so dreadful a penance could expiate his guilt.\r\n\r\n[122] See note on page 245.\r\n\r\n[123] EDITOR’S NOTE.--To this day one of the fields on the adjoining\r\nestate of “Le Mont Durant,” belonging to Colonel de Guérin, bears the\r\nname of “Petite Ville.”\r\n\r\n[124] EDITOR’S NOTES.--There is documentary evidence proving that in\r\nthe early part of the fifteenth century the “Ville au Roi” estate\r\nbelonged to John Thiault, Jurat of the Royal Court. He died, leaving\r\nthree daughters, of whom the eldest married Perrin Careye, and thus\r\nbrought these lands into the Carey family, where they remained until\r\nthe year 1570, when Collette Careye, great, great grand-daughter of\r\nPerrin Careye, married Guillaume De Beauvoir, and received the Ville au\r\nRoi estate as her share of her father’s property. The property did not\r\nremain long in the possession of the De Beauvoir family, as we find,\r\nSeptember 24, 1636, “Monsieur Jean de la Marche, ministre,” its owner,\r\n“à cause d’Ester De Beauvoir, sa femme, fille de Collette Careye.”\r\n\r\nThe Reverend John de la Marche, Rector of St. Andrew’s and subsequently\r\nof the Town parish, married Esther, daughter of William de Beauvoir and\r\nCollette Careye, January 24th, 1616.\r\n\r\n[125] The field at St. Andrew’s where the executions took place was\r\ncalled “Les Galères,” and near it is a lane leading to a water-mill,\r\ncalled “Moulin de L’Échelle,” because the miller had, for his tenure,\r\nto provide the ladder for the executions.\r\n\r\nThere is a small piece of land, just off the road which passes the\r\nMonnaie, and leads from the Bailiff’s Cross Road to the Ecluse Corbin,\r\nwhich is known as “Le Friquet du Gibet.”\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.\r\n\r\nIn the Record Office exists (Assize Roll No. 1165, 17 Edward II.,\r\n1323), a petition of “Cecilia, who was wife of Walter de la Sale,” for\r\nrestitution of lands and rentes bought in their name and in that of\r\ntheir children, in the parishes of St. Peter Port and St. Andrew’s;\r\n“and that these tenements,--on account of the death of the said Walter,\r\nwho was judicially executed last criminal assizes, now three years\r\npast, before Peter Le Marchant, then Bailiff of the Island,--had been\r\nseized by the King.… Upon the inquisition of 12 men of the parish of\r\nSt. Peter Port, and 12 men of the parish of St. Andrew’s, who depose\r\nupon their oath, that the aforesaid Walter was condemned before Peter\r\nLe Marchant, Bailiff of the aforesaid Island, for the murder of Ranulph\r\nVautier[126], three years ago. An inquisition was made, and on account\r\nof the said murder, the said lands were seized into the King’s hands,\r\nand for this cause, and no other, are still detained.… A day given to\r\nthe said Cecilia for the hearing of her case at Jersey, on which day\r\nthe aforesaid Cecilia came, and it is determined that the King removes\r\nhis hand (_i.e._, restores the land), and that from henceforth she has\r\npossession.”\r\n\r\nThe British Museum contains a document, (Add: Ch: 19809) which gives\r\nfurther particulars of “la peticion Cecile qui fut fame Gaultier de la\r\nSalle,” she claiming the lands, etc., as having been bought with her\r\nmoney “et disante que l’avant dit son mari vint en lylle desus dicte\r\nsans nul bien fors son corps.” From this document it appears that\r\nCecilia and her husband built the house, presumably that now known\r\nas “La Ville-au-Roi,” for she claims “une meson séante en la ville\r\nde Saint Pierre Port, de laquelle la place fut fiefeye de Jourdan et\r\nde Johan des Maons … et que du mariage de la dicte Cecile ovecques\r\nautres biens pourchaciez par yceluy mariage, fistent la dicte meson.” …\r\nSigned at St. Peter Port, 10th of October, 1323, before Geoffrey de la\r\n[Hou]gue Guillaume Karupel, Richart Toullay, Guion Nicolle, Renouf de\r\nVic, Henri de la [Mule][127], Guillaume le Genne, Johan Fale, Ranulph\r\nleMoigne, de Saint Pierre Port, and Radulph de Beaucamp, Jurats of the\r\nKing’s Court.\r\n\r\nThe Assize Roll of 32 Edward I (1304), mentions the murder of Brother\r\nJohn del Espin, of the Priory of Lyhou, by Ranulph Vautier and\r\nGuillaume Lenginour, who, after having taken refuge in the Church\r\nof St. Sampson, and abjured the Islands, were pardoned by the King.\r\nGuillaume L’Enginour seems to have been subsequently Gaultier de la\r\nSalle’s accomplice in the murder of Ranulph Gautier, for the “Lettres\r\nCloses” of 1321, mention the restoration of lands to “Guillaume\r\nL’Enginour demeurant accusé de la mort de Ranulphe Gautier, tué dit on\r\ncriminellement, et du vol d’un anneau d’argent au même Ranulphe, et\r\nd’un florin d’or à John de Souslemont, Chapelain”; he being willing to\r\nstand his trial when called upon.\r\n\r\nAmong the “Ancient Petitions” No. 4345 contains a request from John\r\ndu Vivier, Thomas d’Estefeld, and Philip de Vincheles of Guernsey and\r\nJersey, “for protection from the friends of Gaultier de la Salle, his\r\nwife, his son, and his relations, who threaten them because he was\r\nhanged for the murder of Renouf Gautier, murdered in the Castle of\r\nGuernsey, by his acquaintances and others who abjured (the Islands),\r\nfor this deed, such as Master William le Enginour, John Justice, and\r\nChristian Hert”.…\r\n\r\nThe Calendars of Patent Rolls for the years 1313-14, contain mentions\r\nof “Protections” for “Walter de la Salle, clerk” to “the islands\r\nof Gerneseye and Jereseye,” and in the Assize Roll of 1319, he is\r\ndescribed as “Minister” of Otho de Grandison, then Governor of the\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nA Ranulph Gautier was one time bailiff to Otho de Grandison, so the\r\nfeud between the two may have been of long standing. Gaultier de la\r\nSalle was probably a member of one of the many Anglo-Norman families\r\nthen connected with the Channel Islands. His wife Cecilia was evidently\r\na Guernseywoman, and part of their land in St. Andrew’s parish was\r\ninherited from Havise, his wife’s mother. There is reason to believe\r\nthat he was the son of a Robert de la Salle, and Agnes his wife, who\r\nwere landowners in England in the early part of the 14th Century; his\r\nson, Nicholas, was King’s Receiver to Edward III., in 1372-3.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to absolutely locate the lands held by Gaultier de\r\nla Salle, but in a British Museum MS. (Clarence Hopper) is quoted a\r\ndocument, then in the Chapter House, Westminster, shewing that part\r\nof the “Eschaet” of “Galter de Sale” was the “Clos au Botiller,”\r\nwhich particular “Clos” has been identified as part of the territory\r\nnow known as Le Vauquiédor, and in the petition of Cecilia, widow of\r\nGaultier, she mentions lands bought from “Guillaume et Richard le\r\nHubie.” Both the Hubits Lanes and the Vauquiédor estate adjoin that of\r\nthe Ville-au-Roi, the traditionary seat of Gaultier de la Salle.\r\n\r\n_From documents kindly lent me by Lord de Saumarez, Colonel J. H. C.\r\nCarey and Colonel de Guérin._\r\n\r\n[126] He seems to have been called “Vautier” or “Gautier”\r\nindiscriminately.\r\n\r\n[127] Letters illegible, but have been supplied from the “Second Report\r\nof Commissioners (Guernsey)”, p. 303, viz., Names of Officials 5 Ed.\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPECTRE OF LES GRENTMAISONS.\r\n\r\nAt no great distance from the thriving village of St. Sampson’s, which,\r\nthanks to its commodious harbour, the neighbouring granite quarries,\r\nand an extensive trade in stone carried on there, bids fair to become a\r\ntown, stands what was formerly the mansion of a considerable branch of\r\nthe Le Marchant family,[128] one of the most ancient and influential in\r\nthe Channel Archipelago. It is known as “Les Grentmaisons,” the name of\r\na family that has been extinct for some centuries, but which possessed\r\nlands in this part of the island. The house is situated on the high\r\nroad leading from St. Sampson’s to the town of St. Peter Port, and,\r\nalthough surrounded at the present time on all sides, was, at the\r\nbeginning of the present century, far removed from any dwelling--none\r\nindeed being then in sight but those of the town, distant at least two\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nAt that time the proprietor, who possessed a very handsome dwelling in\r\nSt. Peter Port, only inhabited the house of the Grentmaisons during the\r\nsummer months; and in the winter it was closed and left under the care\r\nof a servant, who lived in one of the dependencies. How it had come\r\nto acquire the evil reputation of being haunted, or how long it was\r\nsupposed to have been so, no one could tell, but that it was the resort\r\nof troubled spirits no one could doubt. Fearful noises were heard, and\r\nlights that could not be accounted for were seen in its deserted rooms\r\nduring the long winter nights; and belated wayfarers were affrighted\r\nby the apparition of a horrible beast, with large glaring eyes, and\r\nlong shaggy hair trailing down to the ground, which took its nightly\r\nrambles round the ancient walls, and seemed to guard the house from\r\nintrusion.[129]\r\n\r\n[128] EDITOR’S NOTE.--It was bought by the Reverend Thomas Le Marchant,\r\nRector of St. Sampson’s parish, August the sixth, 1655.\r\n\r\n[129] From Mr. Denys Corbet.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LA BÊTE DE LA PENDUE.”\r\n\r\nThe western coast of Guernsey, abounding in sunken reefs stretching\r\nfar out to sea, and exposed to the full force of the Atlantic waves,\r\nwas, before the establishment of a lighthouse on the Hanois rocks, most\r\ndangerous to shipping coming up Channel, and many a gallant vessel,\r\nwith all its crew, has struck on some hidden danger and gone down in\r\ndeep water, leaving no traces but what the waves might throw up some\r\ndays afterwards on the shore, in the form of detached portions of the\r\nwreck and cargo, or the dead bodies of the hapless mariners.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this inhospitable coast are a rugged race of hardy\r\nfishermen, for the most part experienced pilots, who know every rock\r\nfor miles round, not one of which is without its distinguishing name.\r\nAs might be expected, they are close observers of the weather, and of\r\nevery sign that may indicate a coming storm. Those in the neighbourhood\r\nof L’Érée and Rocquaine declare that they are warned of an approaching\r\ntempest by a peculiar bright light which appears some time before in\r\nthe south-west, and also by a loud roaring, like that of a large animal\r\nin great pain, which appears to proceed from a rock known by the name\r\nof “La Pendue.” They do not attempt to account for this noise, but\r\nspeak of it as “La Bête de la Pendue.”[130]\r\n\r\n[130] From Mrs. Savidan and Mrs. Sarre.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Métivier there is also, in the neighbourhood of Lihou,\r\na rock called “Sanbule,” a very dangerous place for ships, and sailors\r\nsay that underneath this rock can be plainly heard the bellowing of a\r\nbull. It is conjectured that the “bule” in the name of this cliff is\r\nfrom the English “bull” or the Swedish “bulla,” and _san_, from the\r\nFrench _saint_, and that it points to some now-forgotten legend about a\r\nholy bull.--See Clarke’s _Guernsey Magazine_, September, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOLE OF LOAVES AT LE LAURIER.\r\n\r\nIn the parish of St. Pierre-du-Bois, there is a house and estate known\r\nby the name of Le Laurier, where loaves are distributed to the poor\r\non Christmas Eve and on Good Friday. Nothing certain is known of the\r\norigin of this dole, the title-deeds of the property merely containing\r\nthe following item in the enumeration of the ground-rents due on\r\nit:--“_Aux Pauvres de la ditte Paroisse de Saint Pierre-du-Bois,\r\nun quartier de froment de rente, à être distribué en pain aux dits\r\npauvres, à deux diverses fois; savoir, deux boisseaux, partie du\r\ndit quartier à Noel, et les deux autres boisseaux à Pâques, comme\r\nd’ancienneté_.”\r\n\r\nTradition assigns two very different reasons for the institution of\r\nthis charity, one of which is highly probable. It is that, at some\r\nremote period of which all memory is now lost, the house took fire, and\r\nthe proprietor made a vow that if the fire could be extinguished he\r\nwould charge his estate with an annual rent, to be given to the poor\r\nin bread. His prayer was answered, the fire yielding to the efforts of\r\nthose who were attempting to put it out, as if by miracle, and the dole\r\nwas instituted in conformity with the vow.\r\n\r\nThe other tradition, which, as it falls into the domain of the\r\nsupernatural is, of course, a greater favourite with the people, is\r\nto the following effect. In times past, long before the memory of the\r\noldest inhabitants of the parish, the house, for some undefined reason,\r\nbut connected, it is surmised, with some unknown crime of a former\r\nproprietor, was haunted from Christmas Eve to Easter by a hideous\r\nspectre in the form of a black beast like a calf, but as large as an\r\nox. On Christmas Eve the inmates of the house were in the habit of\r\nleaving the front and back doors open, and at midnight precisely the\r\nspectre would pass through.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, the proprietor of the estate bethought himself of\r\ncalling in the aid of the clergy, in hopes that by their powerful\r\nhelp the visits of this unwelcome guest might be put an end to. Their\r\nprayers and exorcisms soon prevailed in quieting the phantom, and, by\r\ntheir advice, the annual distribution of the loaves to the poor was\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\nIt is related, however, that on one occasion the owner of the house,\r\ninstigated by his wife, an avaricious, grasping creature, who would\r\nsooner have seen all the poor in the parish die of hunger than bestow\r\na crust on them, withheld the accustomed dole. He paid dear for it,\r\nfor the house was once more visited by the spectre, which this time\r\nmade its appearance in the form of a gigantic black sow, accompanied\r\nby a numerous litter of pigs, all grunting and clamouring for food, as\r\nif they had not eaten for a week. The master of the house was fain to\r\npurchase peace by restoring to the poor their rights, but it is said\r\nthat to her dying day his wife never recovered from the impression this\r\nsupernatural visit made upon her.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition also that at one time a report having been spread\r\nabroad that the accustomed alms would no longer be distributed, the\r\npoor, who were in the habit of receiving it, assembled at night before\r\nthe house, formed themselves into a procession, and marched through,\r\nentering by the front door, and passing out at the back. The mistress\r\nof the house was watching their proceedings from behind the door, and\r\nwas seen by one of the poor women, who addressed her companion, walking\r\nby her side, in these words:--\r\n\r\n    _“Et chette-chin, est-alle des nôtes?”_\r\n\r\n    (And that woman there, is she one of us?)\r\n\r\nTo which the following answer was returned:--\r\n\r\n    _“Oh! Nennin! quer sa liette nous l’y ôte.”_\r\n\r\n    (Oh! No! for her snood proves it.)\r\n\r\nThe “liette” was the riband or snood with which, in days gone by, the\r\ncap was fastened on the head, and was apparently a bit of finery quite\r\nbeyond the reach of the poor who had assembled on this occasion, and\r\nonly likely to be seen on the head-gear of a person in tolerably easy\r\ncircumstances.[131]\r\n\r\n[131] Partly from John de Garis, Esq., and partly from Mrs. Savidan.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--This story was also told to Miss Le Pelley by an old\r\nwoman in St. Peter’s in 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENCHANTED HORSE.\r\n\r\nA number of young men had met together one evening in search of\r\namusement. One of the party proposed going to a place at some\r\ndistance, where they were likely to fall in with others as fond of\r\nfun as themselves, but, not choosing to fatigue themselves with\r\nwalking, they determined on using some of their neighbours’ horses. A\r\ngood-looking white horse was grazing hard by in a meadow. One of the\r\nparty approached, caught, and mounted him. Another got up behind, but\r\nstill there seemed room for a third: at last, to shorten the story,\r\nthe whole party, in number above a dozen, found accommodation on the\r\nhorse’s back, but, no sooner were they all well seated, than he set off\r\nat full gallop, and, after carrying them through brambles and briers,\r\nover hedges and ditches, to a considerable distance, deposited them all\r\nin the most muddy marsh he could find, and disappeared, leaving them to\r\nfind their way home at midnight, in the best way they could.[132]\r\n\r\n[132] From Rachel Du Port.\r\n\r\nSee Keightley’s _Fairy Mythology_, Vol. II., p. 294. _La Normandie\r\nRomanesque_, p. 128. _Folk-Lore Journal_, Vol. I., p. 292.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nIn _Notions Historiques sur les Côtes-du-Nord_, by M. Habasque, there\r\nis mentioned a goblin called _Mourioche_, and it is said “Mourioche\r\nqui revêt toutes les formes; Mourioche, la monture du diable, qui vole\r\navec la rapidité de l’éclair, qui parsément des points lumineux, et\r\n_qui s’allonge tant que l’on veut, assez du moins pour porter quatre\r\npersonnes_.\r\n\r\n“Cinq jeunes filles partirent un soir pour aller chercher un des\r\nchevaux de la ferme qui était dans la prairie. L’une d’elles monta\r\nsur le dos de la bête; puis une seconde; alors le cheval s’allongea,\r\net il y eut place pour la troisième, et les cinq filles finirent par\r\ns’asseoir sur son dos qui s’allongeait à mesure. La monture des filles\r\nse mit en marche, et quand elle fut arrivée au milieu du ruisseau, elle\r\ndisparut comme si elle s’était évanouie en fumée, et laissa les filles\r\ntomber dans l’eau. Le vrai cheval était déjà rendu à la porte de son\r\nécurie.”--_Traditions et Superstitions de La Haute Bretagne_, Tome II.,\r\np. 66.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPECTRAL CORTÈGE.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting old mansions in Guernsey is that of La\r\nHaye du Puits, in the parish of Le Castel, with its tower rising above\r\nthe roof, its handsome “porte cochère” and its pepper box turrets.\r\nIt has the appearance of having been built early in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and it is known to have been, in the reign of Henry VIII., the\r\nresidence of a family of considerable local antiquity and importance,\r\nof the name of Henry, who had also property in Salisbury, where they\r\nwere known by the anglicised form of their patronymic, Harris. It\r\npassed from their possession into that of the Le Marchant family, to\r\none of whom it still belongs, in the reign of James II.[133] It is\r\njust one of those sort of places that one might expect to find some\r\nlegendary tale or old superstition attached to; but we are not aware\r\nthat either La Haye du Puits, or the neighbouring estate of St. George,\r\nclaims any special property in the spectral appearance, which, from\r\ntime to time, is seen at Le Mont au Deval--a steep ascent over which\r\nthe high road between the two properties passes. Persons travelling at\r\nnight along this road, which in some parts is thickly overshadowed with\r\ntrees, have occasionally met with a funeral procession, preceded, as\r\nis customary in Guernsey, by a clergyman and his attendant clerk, and\r\ncomposed of the usual carriers, pall bearers, mourners, and attendant\r\nfriends. The cortège takes its mournful way in perfect silence--and\r\nwell it may--for, of the many persons who compose it, not one is the\r\nbearer of a head!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Le Coin de la Biche,” St. Martin’s.]\r\n\r\nThere are those, it is said, who affirm to having met it, but it\r\nis looked upon as of evil augury. The death of some one in the\r\nneighbourhood, or of some member of the family of the person who has\r\nthe misfortune to fall in with it, is believed to follow close upon the\r\nappearance of the headless company.[134]\r\n\r\n[133] EDITOR’S NOTE.--It was bought by Joshua Le Marchant from the\r\nheirs of Pierre Henry, June 3rd, 1674.\r\n\r\n[134] From Mr. Denys Corbet.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--In Mr. Paul Sebillot’s _Traditions et Superstitions\r\nde la Haute Bretagne_, Tome I., p. 270, we meet with nearly the same\r\nsuperstition. “Un jour un homme de la Ruèe était à dire ses prières.\r\nIl vit un enterrement qui passait à quelque distance de lui; un homme\r\nportait la croix, puis venait la chasse, les prêtres et des hommes.\r\nHuit jours après, un homme qui était né à la Ruèe mourut, et son\r\nenterrement eut lieu comme celui que l’homme avait vu.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES. “LE COIN DE LA BICHE.”\r\n\r\nThere is a lane leading from the post-box at the “Carrefour David,”\r\non the Saints’ Bay Road to “La Marette,” at the Villette, which was\r\nformerly supposed to be haunted by a spectre in the form of an enormous\r\nnanny-goat.\r\n\r\nAs you go along the lane to the Villette, you will see on your right\r\nhand side a triangular corner overgrown with weeds and brambles, and,\r\nalthough between two fields, not included in either. This corner is\r\nknown as “Le Coin de la Biche”--the Corner of the Nanny Goat.\r\n\r\nTradition marks it as one of the proposed sites for St. Martin’s\r\nChurch, but, they say, when the building was commenced, materials,\r\ntools, etc., were moved by unknown hands, in the course of the night,\r\nto La Beilleuse, its present site, and all attempts to build it there\r\nhad to be abandoned. Ever since then this corner has borne a bad\r\nreputation, and none of the neighbouring proprietors will include it in\r\ntheir fields for fear of ill-luck.\r\n\r\nOne evening, towards the close of the last century, Mr. Mauger, of\r\nthe Villette, and some other men, were returning home from vraiking\r\nat Saints’ Bay. In those days, the road leading to the bay was a\r\nwater-lane with a very narrow footway and a deep rocky channel, down\r\nwhich the water rushed to the sea. High hedges were on either side,\r\nbordered with trees, so that it was a laborious journey for carts to\r\ngo up and down. When the present road was made, the trees were cut\r\ndown, and the earth from the hedges used to fill up the waterway.\r\nAccordingly, this cart had harnessed to it three oxen and two horses,\r\nbut even then progress was slow, and it was getting late as they turned\r\ninto the lane. As they did so, one man said to the other:--\r\n\r\n“_Creyous que nous verrons la biche?_”\r\n\r\n(“Do you think we shall see the goat?”)\r\n\r\n“_Si nous la veyons alle nous f’ra pàs d’mà._”\r\n\r\n(“If we see her, she can do us no harm!”)\r\n\r\nwas the reply. Almost as he spoke out came a great hairy grey\r\nnanny-goat from her corner, and rested her forelegs against the back\r\nof the cart. The oxen tugged, the horses pulled, lashed on by the\r\nterrified men, who were longing to get out of the lane. But nothing\r\ncould move the cart while the great beast stood there with her paws\r\non the cart and looked at them. So they finally had to unharness the\r\ncattle, and lead them on to the Villette, and leave the cart with all\r\nthe vraic in it in the lane.\r\n\r\nNext morning they brought one ox and one horse, who, “La Biche” being\r\ngone, easily pulled the cart home, this part of the country being on\r\nlevel ground.\r\n\r\nAnother night, Mr. Mauger, of Saints’, wanting to go and see his\r\nbrother at the Villette, took the short cut, which is a tiny lane\r\nnext to a little shop at the top of the Icart-road, and which comes\r\nout nearly opposite “Le Coin de la Biche.” He was carrying a torch of\r\n“gllic” (glui[135]--thick straw and resin), and felt that, thus armed,\r\nnothing could attack him. As he turned into the lane, he heard the\r\nclank of a chain, and, looking down, he saw a large brown beast about\r\nthe size of a small calf, with enormous red eyes, which it kept fixed\r\non him, walking by his side. He hurried on, and tried by walking in\r\nthe middle of the lane not to give it room to pass (the lane is barely\r\nthree feet wide), but it was always there, on the footpath, keeping\r\nstep with him. When he turned into the broader lane, where its own\r\nspecial “corner” is, it turned away, and he hurried on to the Villette.\r\nDetermined not to give in to his cowardice, he came home the same\r\nway, and there where it had left him was the beast waiting for him.\r\nIt walked with him, on his other hand this time, still keeping to the\r\nfootpath, till he got into the Icart-road, where it disappeared.\r\n\r\nThese stories were told me in 1896 by Mrs. Le Patourel, of St.\r\nMartin’s, who was a Miss Mauger, of Saints’, and she was told them by\r\na relative of hers who was a daughter of the Mr. Mauger to whom these\r\nincidents happened. She declared that they were absolutely true.\r\n\r\nOur coachman, whose father lived in the neighbourhood at “Les Pages,”\r\njust above Petit Bôt, told me that his father would never let him go\r\nalong that lane after dark, and would never go himself, for fear of “La\r\nBiche,” and many other inhabitants of St. Martin’s tell the same story.\r\n\r\nAnother old man, belonging to one of the most respectable families\r\nin the parish, and who had himself been churchwarden for eleven\r\nyears, told me that in his youth he lived in the neighbourhood of the\r\nVillette, and one evening his sister, then a strong young girl of\r\nsixteen, rushed in saying she had seen “La Biche.” The shock was so\r\ngreat that she took to her bed and died shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\n[135] These torches of “glui” were called “des Brandons.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThe Devil.\r\n\r\n    “The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman.”\r\n\r\n                            --_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n                          “Tis a history\r\n    Handed from ages down; a nurse’s tale,\r\n    Which children open-eyed and mouth’d devour,\r\n    And thus, as garrulous ignorance relates,\r\n    We learn it, and believe.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious allusions to his Satanic Majesty have already appeared in these\r\npages. He has left his footprints on various rocks; he carried away\r\nbodily Jean Vivian, Vavasseur de St. Michel; he fought with St. Patrick\r\nat the Hougue Patris; and he enticed Duke Richard in the form of a\r\nbeautiful woman. He is of course head of the fraternity of wizards and\r\nwitches, and many references to him occur in all the legends dealing\r\nwith witchcraft, but there are a few stories dealing with him “in\r\npropriâ personâ,” and these are collected in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to state that his usual manifestation is believed\r\nto be in the form of a huge black cat. He takes this shape apparently\r\nwhen he wishes to pass incognito. Black cats in general are looked upon\r\nwith a suspicious eye, but if seen in the house of anyone supposed to\r\nbe addicted to magical arts, there is no doubt of their being imps of\r\nSatan.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATAN OUTWITTED.\r\n\r\nIt was Midsummer Day, the sun was shining brightly, and the country\r\npeople were hastening in their holiday apparel to the spot where the\r\nmilitia were ordered to muster for a review, when an unfortunate\r\ncountry girl was ordered by her master to weed a large field of\r\nparsnips. He promised her that when her task was accomplished she\r\nshould be allowed the rest of the day to amuse herself; but she soon\r\ndiscovered that this promise meant nothing, for that her utmost\r\nexertions would not suffice to finish the allotted work before the\r\nevening should close in. She commenced her task with a heavy heart,\r\nand often lifted her head as she heard the joyous laugh of the groups\r\nof lads and lasses as they passed along the high road on their way to\r\nthe place of rendezvous. One party followed another, and as they became\r\nless frequent, the poor girl lost patience. Her hopes of taking any\r\nshare in the amusements of the day were nearly at an end. At last she\r\ngave utterance to her thoughts, and wished aloud for assistance, were\r\nit even from the Devil himself.\r\n\r\nScarcely had she expressed this unhallowed wish, when she thought she\r\nheard a slight noise behind her, and, on looking round, saw a gentleman\r\ndressed entirely in black, who in the kindest manner immediately\r\naddressed her and enquired why she looked so sad, and how it was she\r\nwas not merry-making with her companions.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” she answered, “I must weed the whole of this field before I am\r\nreleased.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said he, “is that all? Only promise me the first knot you tie\r\nto-morrow morning and I will get your task performed.”\r\n\r\nThe girl easily agreed to these terms, and the gentleman departed.\r\n\r\nShe resumed her work, but was astonished to perceive that invisible\r\nhands were employed in every part of the field, tearing up the weeds\r\nand gathering them in bundles. In a very short time the ground was\r\nclear, and she went to announce it to her master, who, astonished\r\nat the rapidity with which she had executed his orders, gave her\r\npermission to spend the rest of the day in amusement.\r\n\r\nShe went accordingly to the review, and from thence to the “Son,”[136]\r\nwhere she danced the greater part of the evening. As night came on,\r\nhowever, she began to reflect on the adventures of the morning, and to\r\nconsider that the assistance which she had accepted was most probably\r\nnot of a very holy nature, and that something more might be meant\r\nby the promise which she had made than the mere words implied. She\r\nreturned home and retired to her bed, but was unable to compose herself\r\nto sleep. The more she thought of what she had done the more uneasy did\r\nshe feel.\r\n\r\nAt last, in her perplexity, she resolved to rise immediately and seek\r\nadvice from the Rector of the parish. The worthy clergyman was much\r\nalarmed at this open attack made by Satan on one of his flock, but bade\r\nher fear nothing, but put her trust in Heaven, go home, and spend the\r\nremainder of the night in prayer and repentance, and as soon as morning\r\ndawned, before she fastened a single knot, to go to the barn, taking\r\nher Bible with her, and, praying without ceasing, there bind up a\r\nsheaf of barley straw.\r\n\r\nThe girl did as she was advised, and scarcely had she knotted the wisp\r\nof straw, when the gentleman in black stood at her side. His looks and\r\nvoice were no longer so mild and prepossessing as they had been the\r\nday before, and the poor maiden, no longer doubting as to the infernal\r\ncharacter of the stranger, was near fainting from fright. She was soon\r\nreassured, however, when she saw the good minister enter the barn, who,\r\nin God’s name, bade Satan avaunt. The Devil was not proof against this\r\nsolemn adjuration, but disappeared with a loud noise, and the poor\r\ngirl, full of gratitude for her miraculous escape, made a solemn vow\r\nto avoid for the future all those places of resort and merry-makings,\r\nby which Satan endeavours to tempt the unwary into sin, and to live\r\ncontentedly thenceforward in that station of life which Providence had\r\nallotted to her.[137]\r\n\r\n[136] The old name for the village dances, generally held in some\r\ntavern to the sound of that obsolete instrument, the “chifournie.”\r\n\r\n[137] From Miss Louisa Lane.\r\n\r\nIn the tales of this nature related in Lower Brittany, the soul that is\r\nsold to the evil one is always rescued by the advice or intercession of\r\na holy hermit or priest, see Luzel’s _Veillies Bretonnes_, p. 132.\r\n\r\n“Quand le diable paraît, il est généralement vêtu de couleur sombre, et\r\nsouvent il ressemblerait exactement à une “manière de monsieur” ou à\r\nun gros fermier, si on ne regardait ses pieds, dont l’un au moins est\r\ndéformé et semblable à un sabot de cheval. Parfois aussi il a des gants\r\nde cuir ou des griffes pointues. On lui prête aussi un habillement\r\ntout rouge, et le cheval qu’il monte est tout noir.”--_Traditions et\r\nSuperstitions de la Haute Bretagne_, Tome I., p. 179.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATAN AND THE SCHOOLMASTER.\r\n\r\nIt is good to possess knowledge, but, like all other possessions,\r\nthe benefit to be derived from it depends on the uses to which it\r\nis applied, and there is no doubt that it exposes the possessor to\r\ntemptations which the more ignorant and simple-minded escape--to say\r\nnothing of the envy and calumny which often follow the man who by his\r\nsuperior acquirements, rises above the vulgar herd.\r\n\r\nIn the past century, the parish of St. Michel du Valle was fortunate in\r\nhaving secured the services of a man of more than ordinary attainments\r\nas its schoolmaster. Pallot was no common character, and his studious\r\nand retiring habits were but little appreciated by the surrounding\r\nfarmers. They wondered at his superior knowledge, but could not\r\nunderstand his shutting himself up in his schoolroom after the labours\r\nof the day were over. In their opinion it would have been far more wise\r\nand natural for him to follow the example of his scholars, and throw\r\naside his books until the next day. It was known that his studies were\r\noften prolonged far into the night, and, little by little, it came to\r\nbe whispered about that these studies were of a nature that could not\r\nbear the light of day, and, in short, that the schoolmaster was in\r\nleague with the powers of darkness. Pallot felt hurt at the imputation,\r\nbut at the same time somewhat flattered at the deference paid him by\r\nhis ignorant neighbours.\r\n\r\n“Knowledge puffeth up,” and of all pride the pride of intellect is the\r\nmost dangerous, and exposes the man who gives way to it to the greatest\r\ntemptation. Satan knows well how to make use of the opportunities which\r\nare afforded him to extend his empire and work the ruin of souls. The\r\nschoolmaster--one whose influence over the youth of the parish was\r\nso great--was a prize worth securing, and the great enemy of mankind\r\nlaid siege to him in due form. His approaches were made with skill,\r\nbut with little or no success. At last he determined on a desperate\r\nexpedient--that of a personal interview. The conference lasted for some\r\nhours, the most tempting offers were made, but Pallot, now thoroughly\r\non his guard, was firm, and had grace to resist. He had too much regard\r\nfor his soul to yield in anything to the enemy, and Satan, out of\r\npatience, rushed out of the schoolroom, carrying off with him the gate\r\nof the inclosure, which was found next morning on a large hawthorn bush\r\non the summit of the Hougue Juas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Looking up Fountain Street, 1825.”]\r\n\r\nThe thorn, which was previously green and flourishing, was blasted as\r\nif struck by lightning, and, although not killed, never recovered its\r\nformer beauty, but retained for ever afterwards the same scathed and\r\nwithered look.[138]\r\n\r\n[138] From Miss Harriet Chepmell.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER VERSION OF “SATAN AND THE SCHOOLMASTER.”\r\n\r\nIt is related that in days long past there lived in the vicinity of the\r\nRoque Balan, at L’Ancresse, a man of very superior acquirements. It is\r\ntrue that he was commonly suspected of knowing more than was altogether\r\nlawful, but as he ostensibly gained his living by instructing the youth\r\nof the parish, and as there was no doubt that his scholars profited by\r\nhis teaching, the neighbouring farmers made no hesitation in sending\r\ntheir sons to him. Among his pupils was one lad of whom he was justly\r\nproud, for a prying curiosity and love of acquiring knowledge, joined\r\nto a retentive memory and a sharp intellect, had made the boy, in the\r\nopinion of many, almost a match for his master. Curiosity and a love of\r\nacquiring knowledge may be good in themselves, but they can be carried\r\ntoo far, and this proved to be the case with the young scholar.\r\n\r\nHe had noticed some old-looking tomes which his preceptor kept always\r\ncarefully locked up in an old carved oak chest, and had long felt\r\nmost anxious to pry into their contents. The clearest hints he could\r\ngive, and even the openly-expressed wish to be allowed to peruse the\r\nhidden volumes, met with no response on the part of his teacher. He\r\ndetermined to watch his opportunity, and to get a sight, by hook or\r\nby crook, of the contents of the mysterious books, and one day, when\r\nthe master had been called away suddenly to make the will of a dying\r\nman, and had inadvertently left his keys behind him, the youth seized\r\non them, and, as soon as his back was turned, proceeded to examine the\r\ncontents of the chest. He lifted one of the ponderous tomes, opened it\r\nat hazard, and commenced to read out aloud the first passage which met\r\nhis eye. Unfortunately this proved to be the spell by which the Prince\r\nof Darkness can be summoned to this upper world to do the bidding of\r\nhis votaries. Great was the terror of the indiscreet youngster when\r\na sudden violent storm arose, which went on increasing in intensity,\r\nand Satan in person appeared before him and demanded what he wanted of\r\nhim. The unfortunate boy knew not what answer to make, nor what task\r\nto impose on the demon to get rid of him at least for a time, until\r\nthe return of the master. Pallot, who was already at some distance\r\nfrom home, hastened back, and entered the house just at the moment\r\nwhen Satan, tired of waiting and enraged at having been unnecessarily\r\ncalled up, had seized on the inquisitive scholar and was on the point\r\nof flying off with him. The master, at a glance, perceived how matters\r\nstood, and, uttering a hasty spell, arrested the demon in his course.\r\nHe then proceeded to set him a task, promising him that if he succeeded\r\nin accomplishing it before sunset he should be at liberty to carry off\r\nhis prey.\r\n\r\nThe Devil made some difficulty in acceding to these terms, but the\r\nschoolmaster, determined, if possible, to save his unfortunate pupil,\r\nwas firm, and not to be influenced either by the threats or cajoleries\r\nof the arch-fiend. He caught up a peck-measure containing peas, and\r\nscattered them on the floor, handing at the same time a three-pronged\r\npitch-fork to the Devil, and ordering him with that instrument to throw\r\nthe peas over the door-hatch into the court-yard.\r\n\r\nSatan took the fork and set to work with right good will, but soon\r\nfound that it was labour in vain. Not one pea could he raise from the\r\nfloor. The sun was fast sinking below the horizon. As the last portion\r\nof its orb disappeared beneath the western wave, the enraged and\r\ndisappointed demon wrenched the door-hatch off its hinges and cast it\r\nfar away in the direction of Les Landes. There it was found the next\r\nmorning on a thorn-bush, which had been green and flourishing the day\r\nbefore, but which, since that time, is blasted and flattened almost to\r\nthe level of the ground, though it still lives and is pointed out as a\r\nproof of the truth of this history.[139]\r\n\r\n[139] From Sieur Henry Bisson.\r\n\r\nThis incident is found in a Breton legend, as told by Dr. Alfred\r\nFouquet in his work _Légendes, Contes, et Chansons Populaires du\r\nMorbihan_, apropos of the first occupant of the lands on which the\r\nChâteau de Herlean was afterwards built. Satan undertook to be the\r\nservant of a peasant as long as work could be found for him to do.\r\nHe accomplished the most difficult tasks with the greatest ease. At\r\nlast the peasant emptied a sack of millet into the court-yard and\r\nordered Satan to pitch it up to him in the granary with a hay-fork. He\r\nacknowledged his inability and was ignominiously dismissed.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar story is also told in _Notes and Queries_. The Vicar\r\nof a certain Devonshire parish was a diligent student of the black art,\r\nand possessed a large collection of mysterious books and MSS. During\r\nhis absence at church, one of his servants entered his study, and,\r\nfinding a large volume open on the desk, imprudently began to read it\r\naloud. He had scarcely read half a page when the sky became dark and\r\na great wind shook the house violently. Still he read on, and in the\r\nmidst of the storm the doors flew open and a black hen and chickens\r\ncame into the room. They were of the ordinary size when they first\r\nappeared, but gradually became larger and larger, until the hen was of\r\nthe bigness of a good-size ox. At this point, the Vicar (in the church)\r\nsuddenly closed his discourse and dismissed his congregation, saying\r\nhe was wanted at home and hoped he might arrive there in time. When he\r\nentered the chamber, the hen was already touching the ceiling. But he\r\nthrew down a bag of rice which stood ready in the corner, and, whilst\r\nthe hen and chickens were busily picking up the grains, the Vicar had\r\ntime to reverse the spell.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--This story is still believed. It was told me by Miss\r\nFalla in 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL AND THE TAILOR.\r\n\r\nThe race of journeymen tailors and shoemakers, hired by the day to\r\nmake up, at the houses of their employers, the materials that have\r\nbeen provided beforehand, or to patch and mend the clothes and shoes\r\nrequiring repairs, is not yet quite extinct in the rural districts of\r\nGuernsey; although the facility of access to the town of St. Peter\r\nPort, afforded by the excellent roads which intersect the island in all\r\ndirections, and the superior make and fashion of the articles supplied\r\nby the tradesmen in town,--to say nothing of the ready-made clothing so\r\ngenerally used in the present day--have had the effect of considerably\r\ndiminishing the number of men who gain their living in this way.\r\nAlthough we have no knowledge that the journeyman tailor was ever the\r\nimportant character here that he is in Brittany and even in Normandy,\r\nwhere he is sometimes employed in the delicate office of negotiating\r\nmarriages between the families of distant hamlets, and where he is\r\noften the sole means of circulating the news of the outer world, or\r\ncarrying the gossiping tales of one village to another, yet even here\r\nhis presence for a day or two in a house is looked forward to with\r\npleasure as a break in the monotony of the daily family routine; and if\r\nhe should chance to be what the French call “un farceur,” or teller of\r\ngood stories, he is doubly welcome.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that, as a rule, this class of men are not\r\nsupposed to be very particular as to the exact truth of the stories\r\nthey put in circulation, and that some of them would be better members\r\nof society, if, on quitting their work, they were to go straight home,\r\nwithout thinking it a part of their duty to turn into every house where\r\ndrink is sold, that they may chance to fall in with on their way.\r\n\r\nThe hero of the following adventure, if fame does not belie him, is one\r\nof this sort, and, although he affirms the truth of the story, there is\r\nno corroborative evidence that it is anything more than the dream of a\r\ndrunken man.\r\n\r\nIt appeared in a letter from a correspondent to the _Gazette de\r\nGuernesey_ of the 22nd December, 1873, and is translated literally,\r\nomitting only the writer’s sensible remarks on the folly and simplicity\r\nof those who could give credence to such an invention, and on the\r\nsuperstition which, in spite of education, is still so prevalent among\r\nthe lower orders. There is no doubt that the story was widely spread\r\nand believed in the country, and that the tailor, when questioned about\r\nit, asserts it to be true.\r\n\r\nHe is an inhabitant of the parish of Torteval, and a Guernseyman born\r\nand bred, although bearing a name which shews that his family came\r\noriginally from another country. One evening, as he was returning from\r\nhis work, a certain tailor, who shall be nameless, and who bears but an\r\nindifferent character, met with an adventure which was far from being\r\nagreeable. A man, dressed entirely in black, of a sinister aspect, and\r\nmounted on a black horse, met him on his way. This strange looking\r\nindividual stopped the tailor, and the following conversation took\r\nplace:\r\n\r\n“Hallo, you’re a tailor, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, at your service,” answered the tailor, somewhat alarmed.\r\n\r\n“Then I wish you to make me a pair of trousers, which I will come and\r\nfetch at your house to-morrow at noon.” And, so saying, the stranger\r\nwent on his way.\r\n\r\n“But, sir,” cried the tailor, running after him, “You’ve forgotten to\r\nlet me take your measure.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! what does that matter?”\r\n\r\n“But, sir, I shall never be able to fit you if I’ve not got your\r\nmeasure.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, take it,” said the gentleman in black, dismounting from his\r\nhorse. “There!”\r\n\r\nBut imagine the poor tailor’s dismay! There were no legs to be seen. Do\r\nwhat he would, it was impossible to take a proper measure for trousers\r\nunder such circumstances. A horrible suspicion flashed through his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n“It must be the Devil,” thought he to himself. “How shall I get rid of\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\nAlarmed, horrified, trembling in all his limbs, feeling his legs giving\r\nway under him, our poor tailor only got out of the scrape by stammering\r\nout these few words--\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, your trousers shall be ready to-morrow at noon.”\r\n\r\n“Look to yourself if they are not ready. I shall come and fetch them\r\nat your house,” answered the dark-visaged and black-coated individual,\r\nleaping on his horse and going on his way.\r\n\r\nSeized with uncontrollable fear, it is said that the tailor went\r\nstraight to the Rector of his parish, and told him the whole of his\r\nadventure. The good parson advised him to make the trousers, and\r\npromised him that he would not fail to be with him the next day to be\r\nwitness to the delivery of them. Accordingly, the next day, at the hour\r\nappointed, and, but a few minutes after the arrival of the clergyman,\r\nwho was beforehand with him, the Devil knocked at the tailor’s door to\r\nclaim the trousers; and the hero of our tale, in delivering them, heard\r\nhis Satanic Majesty utter these words--\r\n\r\n“If a man of God had not been present in this house, I would have\r\ncarried you off also.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT APPEARANCE OF THE DEVIL.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the spread of rationalism in other places, a belief\r\nin the personality of Satan still holds its ground firmly in the\r\nminds of our peasantry. How can it be otherwise when there are those\r\nwho, within the last two or three years, have had the rare chance of\r\nseeing him “in propriâ personâ;” and this in a locality which, one\r\nmight suppose, would be about the very last that he would be inclined\r\nto honour with his presence? The neighbourhood of L’Erée, it is true,\r\nhas never borne a very high character. Everyone knows that from time\r\nimmemorial the hill of Catiauroc and the beach of Rocquaine have been\r\nthe favourite resort of witches and warlocks, and that their infernal\r\nmaster holds his court there every Friday night, and, seated in state\r\non the cromlech which is called “Le Trépied,” receives the homage of\r\nhis deluded votaries. But who could suppose that he would leave this\r\ntime-honoured haunt to become the inmate of a Methodist Chapel? Such,\r\nhowever, if we can attach any credit to the statements of the fishermen\r\nand others who inhabit this coast, is undoubtedly the case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Looking down Berthelot Street, 1880.”]\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years the Wesleyans have erected several small\r\nchapels in various parts of the island, and, among others, one near\r\na place called “Les Adams.” Shortly after the chapel was finished it\r\nbegan to be whispered about that lights were seen in it at hours of\r\nthe night when it was well known that no one was likely to be there.\r\nThe light is described by some who had seen it from a distance as if\r\nilluminating the whole of the interior, but some fishermen who were\r\nbold enough to draw near and look in at the windows could see nothing\r\nbut a small subdued flame in one corner, which seemed to sink downwards\r\ninto the earth. A gentleman of strict veracity, formerly residing\r\nabout a mile from the spot, declared that he had frequently seen the\r\nmysterious light. He described it as being of a pale blue colour, and\r\nwas convinced that it did not proceed from either candle or lamp. He\r\nhad seen it from various points, from the rising ground inland, to the\r\neast of the chapel, and from the low lands lying along the sea-shore\r\nto the west. It seemed to occupy a particular spot in the building,\r\nfor the light appeared brightest through one of the windows, and\r\nfainter through all the others. He had observed it on many occasions\r\nimmediately after dusk, and at hours when it was most unlikely that\r\nany person would be in the chapel for any improper purpose. On drawing\r\nnear, the light always disappeared. The state of the weather or of\r\nthe moon seemed to make no difference in it. Curiosity, thus excited,\r\nhad to be appeased, and, at last, some of the fishermen ventured to\r\napproach the chapel and peep in at the windows. What they saw they\r\ndescribed as “Le Dain,” the name by which his Satanic Majesty is\r\ndesignated when it is thought proper to avoid the more offensive\r\nappellation of “Le Guyablle.” Sparks of fire issued from his mouth and\r\nnostrils, the traditional horns and tail seem to have been discerned,\r\nbut the cloven feet were hidden by long boots covering the knees, and\r\nwhich, according to some accounts, were red.\r\n\r\nHis occupation was as difficult to be accounted for as his presence\r\nin so unusual a place. It was that of dancing and leaping with all\r\nhis might and main! Whether the fishermen really saw anything which\r\ntheir fears magnified into a vision of the wicked one, or whether, for\r\nreasons of their own, they wished to impose upon the credulity of their\r\nneighbours, it is impossible to say. One thing is certain, and that\r\nis that persons of the highest respectability, living in that part of\r\nthe country, vouch for the fact of the lights having frequently been\r\nseen in the chapel at hours of the night when it ought not to have been\r\noccupied. It does not seem to have occurred to them that many of the\r\nmariners on this part of the coast are employed at times in carrying\r\noff packages of tobacco to the English and French boats engaged in\r\nsmuggling, and that, as a temporary depôt may be sometimes required\r\nfor these goods, the chapel may have been selected for the purpose, in\r\npreference to a dwelling house or other private property, the owner of\r\nwhich, in case of detection, might be subjected to much inconvenience.\r\nBut the neighbouring peasants have their own method of explaining these\r\nsupernatural appearances.\r\n\r\nSome say that they are a judgment on the original founders of the\r\nchapel, who, as it is believed and reported, after having collected\r\nample subscriptions towards the building, pretended that the funds\r\nwere insufficient, and defrauded the workmen whom they had employed\r\nof their just dues. Others say that the original proprietor of the\r\nland on which the chapel is built, was importuned by his wife to make\r\na free gift of the site, but, being strongly averse to dissent in all\r\nforms, could never be brought by her to consent to the alienation;\r\nbut that immediately on the death of the old man, the widow, who,\r\nafter a youth spent in frivolity and pleasure, had turned wonderfully\r\npious in her declining years, took measures to make over the ground to\r\nthe dissenters, and, not content with this, squandered on them large\r\nsums of money which ought rightly to have been reserved for her late\r\nhusband’s children by a former marriage. The spirit of the departed\r\ncould not brook such disregard of his wishes, and such disrespect for\r\nhis memory, and manifests his displeasure by haunting the spot of\r\nwhich his children ought never to have been deprived.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--When in Sark in 1896 I was told by one of the old\r\nSark men, how a Sark fisherman defeated the Devil. This fisherman was\r\nsupposed to be given to witchcraft, and one day he succeeded in raising\r\nthe Devil, when Satan appeared and asked him what commands he had for\r\nhim. The fisherman had nothing to say. Finally he said, “You must\r\ncarry me where I tell you.” They were then on the far end of Little\r\nSark. So the Devil consented, but on the understanding that when they\r\nreached their destination, the man, in his turn, should do what Satan\r\ncommanded. So the man mounted on Satan’s back, and first was carried\r\nacross the Coupée. “_Allez plus loin_,” (Go farther) said the man. Then\r\nthey went on to the Carrefour, near where the Bel Air Hotel now is.\r\n“_Allez plus loin_,” said the man when Satan stopped for a rest. Then\r\nthey reached the Port du Moulin, where the fisherman’s cottage stood.\r\n“_Au nom du Grand Dieu--Arrêtez!_” (In God’s name--Stop!) At that the\r\nDevil had to put him down and fly away shrieking, “for,” as the old man\r\nconcluded his story, “he is powerless when God’s name is said.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nProphetic Warnings and Ghosts.\r\n\r\n    “Now there spreaden a rumour that everich night\r\n    The rooms ihaunted been by many a Sprite,\r\n    The Miller avoucheth, and all thereabout\r\n    That they full oft hearen the Hellish Rout,\r\n    Some faine they hear the gingling of Chains,\r\n    And some hath heard the Psautries straines,\r\n    At midnight some the headless Horse i meet,\r\n    And some espien a Corse in a white Sheet;\r\n    And other things, Faye, Elfin and Elfe,\r\n    And shapes that Fear createn to itself.”\r\n\r\n                                           --_Gay._\r\n\r\n    “Et chacun croit fort aisément ce qu’il craint.”\r\n\r\n                                    --_La Fontaine._\r\n\r\n    “Now I remember those old women’s words\r\n    Who in my youth would tell me winter’s tales\r\n    And speak of sprites and ghosts that glide by night\r\n    About the place where treasure hath been hid.”\r\n\r\n                           --_Marlowe’s “Jew of Venice.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nProphetic Warnings.\r\n\r\n                      “These true shadows.…\r\n    Forerunning thus their bodies, may approve\r\n    That all things to be done, as here we live,\r\n    Are done before all times in th’other life.”\r\n\r\n                                    --_Chapman._\r\n\r\nIt is a very common belief that events, particularly those of a\r\nmelancholy nature, are foreshadowed. Unusual noises in or about a\r\nhouse, such as cannot easily be accounted for, the howling of a dog,\r\nthe crowing of cocks at unaccustomed hours, the hooting of owls, and\r\nmany other things are looked upon as warnings of evil to come, or, as\r\nthey are locally termed, “_avertissements_.” This term is also applied\r\nto a sort of second-sight, in which a person fancies he sees an image\r\nof himself, or, to make use of a Scotch word, his own “wraith.” This\r\nillusion, arising no doubt from a derangement of the optic nerve\r\nconsequent on the weakness produced by ill-health, is considered a sure\r\nforerunner of death. Two instances of this, both occurring towards the\r\nend of the last century, have come to my knowledge. In the one case,\r\na young gentleman, slowly dying of decline, was seated near a window,\r\nwhich commanded a view of the avenue leading to the country house\r\nin which he resided. Suddenly he saw a figure, which he recognised\r\nas his own, standing at the corner of a pathway which led into a\r\ncherry-orchard, a favourite resort of his when in health. His sister\r\nwas every moment expected to return home from a ride, and, fearing\r\nthat her horse might take fright at the apparition, he immediately\r\ndispatched a servant to meet her, and cause her to return to the house\r\nby another way. He died not many hours afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn the other instance, a young lady, who was known to be very fragile\r\nand delicate, was spending the day at her brother’s country-house. It\r\nwas summer, and the room in which she was seated with the other members\r\nof the family looked out on a parterre gay with flowers. Suddenly she\r\ninterrupted the conversation which was going on, by exclaiming:--\r\n\r\n“How singular! I see myself yonder in the garden gathering flowers.”\r\n\r\nHer friends tried to laugh her out of her fancy, but neither ridicule\r\nnor reason prevailed. She persisted in saying that she had seen her own\r\nlikeness in the garden. She grew rapidly worse, and before the autumn\r\nwas over she passed away.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that both fruit and blossoms are to be seen at\r\nthe same time on apple and pear trees. When this occurs it is believed\r\nto be a sure presage that a death will follow in the family of the\r\nproprietor of the tree within the year.[140]\r\n\r\nGreat faith is also put in dreams by our country people, as the\r\nfollowing stories will show. They make use of many charms and spells to\r\ninvoke certain dreams, and those will be told in a future chapter, but\r\nthe following show the belief that exists in the truth of dreams.\r\n\r\nDuring the late war with France many privateers were fitted out. A\r\nman dreamt that if a vessel were sent out to a certain latitude and\r\nlongitude, that on a certain day it would meet with a rich prize and\r\ntake it. He realised all his property, bought a ship, equipped and\r\nmanned it, and sent it out to cruise, in full faith that his dream\r\nwould come to pass. Time rolled on, and the ship did not appear. The\r\nman’s friends and neighbours began to jeer at him, but he still felt\r\nconfident that all would turn out as he had dreamt. His faith was at\r\nlast rewarded, for one day, when all but he had given up any hope of\r\nseeing the vessel again, two vessels were seen in the offing. As they\r\ndrew near one was recognised as the missing ship, and the other was\r\nsoon made out, by its rig, to be a foreigner. They came safely into St.\r\nPeter Port, and it was then found that the latter was a Spaniard, with\r\na very rich cargo. It turned out that the capture had been made in the\r\nvery place and at the very time that had been dreamt of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Cow Lane.”]\r\n\r\nA country gentleman had occasion to make some alterations in the level\r\nof a road in the neighbourhood of his house. He employed two men in\r\nthe work, a father and son. The materials for the work were to be\r\ntaken from a gravel pit on the estate, and the work was progressing\r\nfavourably, when, one morning, the gentleman, on coming down to\r\nbreakfast, said to his wife that he had had an unpleasant dream, and\r\nfeared that some accident would happen to the workmen before the day\r\nwas out. He went out shortly afterwards and cautioned the men, as he\r\nhad done previously, to be very careful in digging out the materials\r\nthey were in want of from the overhanging banks of the gravel pit. They\r\nmade light of his admonition, and he left them. Towards noon the elder\r\nof the two workmen left the place to go home to dinner, leaving his son\r\nbehind. On his return, about an hour later, he found that the bank had\r\ngiven way and buried his son in the rubbish. When, after a considerable\r\ntime, he was dug out, he was found to be quite dead.\r\n\r\n[140] From Mr. Thomas Lenfestey and Mr. George Allez.\r\n\r\nSee _Notes and Queries_, VI. Series, IV., 55.\r\n\r\n\r\nGhosts.\r\n\r\n    “That the dead are seen no more, I will not undertake to\r\n    maintain against the concurrent and unvaried testimony of\r\n    all ages and of all nations. There is no people, rude or\r\n    unlearned, among whom apparitions of the dead are not related\r\n    and believed. This opinion, which prevails as far as human\r\n    nature is diffused, could become universal only by its truth.\r\n    Those who never heard of another, would not have agreed in a\r\n    tale which nothing but experience can make credible. That it is\r\n    doubted by single cavillers can very little weaken the general\r\n    evidence, and some who deny it with their tongues confess it\r\n    with their fears.”--_Dr. Samuel Johnson._\r\n\r\nThe belief that the spirits of the dead are, under certain\r\ncircumstances, permitted to revisit the places which they were in the\r\nhabit of frequenting, and the persons with whom they were acquainted\r\nwhile in the body, has too strong a hold on the human mind not to\r\nbe still an article of popular faith in this island; but the doings\r\nof these disembodied spirits do not differ sensibly from what is\r\nattributed to them in other European countries.\r\n\r\nThe ghost of the murdered man still haunts the spot where he was foully\r\ndeprived of life, crying for vengeance on his assassin. The murderer’s\r\nform is seen at the foot of the gibbet where he expiated his crime.\r\nThe shade of the suicide lingers about the spot where he committed\r\nhis rash act. The spirit of the tender mother is seen bending over\r\nthe cradles of her darling children, smoothing their tangled locks,\r\nwashing their begrimed faces, and lamenting over the neglected state\r\nin which they are allowed to remain by a careless or unkind step-dame.\r\nThe acquirer of ill-gotten wealth wanders about, vainly endeavouring\r\nto make restitution. And the ghosts of the shipwrecked mariners who\r\nhave perished in the waves, roam along the fatal shore, and, with loud\r\nwailings, claim a resting place for their remains in their mother-earth.\r\n\r\nSome also say that the departing spirit occasionally takes the form of\r\na bird, and, from a story told us, it would seem that it also sometimes\r\nputs on the form of a mouse.\r\n\r\nAn elderly woman who lived alone in a house in the neighbourhood of\r\nSte. Hélène was found one morning dead at the bottom of a flight of\r\nstairs. From the evidence at the inquest it appeared that she had\r\nentrusted the latch key of the front door to a workman, who was to\r\ncome early to the house next morning to do some small job in the way\r\nof plastering. It was supposed that before retiring to rest, at her\r\nusual hour between nine and ten, she had intended to go to the door to\r\nsee whether the door was properly latched, and that, in descending the\r\nstairs, she had slipped, and, falling forward, had broken her neck.\r\n\r\nShe had a first cousin, within a week or two of the same age as\r\nherself, with whom she had been brought up, and between whom and\r\nherself great affection had always existed. About the time that the\r\naccident must have happened, this cousin was sitting with his wife, by\r\nwhom the story was related to me, warming themselves before the fire,\r\npreviously to getting into bed. They were speaking of the old woman,\r\nand the husband remarked that he had not seen her for some days, and\r\nhoped she was well, and then immediately made the remark that he had\r\nseen a mouse run across the room, coming from the door towards them.\r\nHis eyesight was very defective, and his wife endeavoured to persuade\r\nhim that it was impossible that he could have seen anything of the\r\nkind, and that, moreover, she had never seen a mouse in that room.\r\n\r\nThey went to bed and nothing more was thought about it until the next\r\nmorning, when the wife, passing the house where the old woman lived,\r\nsaw a crowd of neighbours assembled round the door, and found that the\r\ndead body of her husband’s cousin had just been discovered lying at the\r\nfoot of the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe accident in all probability had occurred at the very time she\r\nand her husband were speaking of the deceased, and when the old man\r\ndeclared he saw the mouse. She was fully convinced that the spirit of\r\nthe old woman had come in that shape to take a last look and farewell\r\nof her kinsman.[141]\r\n\r\n[141] Related to me by Mrs. Andrew Thorn, wife of the old man.\r\n\r\n“In many Teutonic myths, we find that the soul leaves the body in the\r\nshape of a mouse.”--_Folk-Lore Journal_, Vol. II., Part VII., p. 208.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROBBER OF THE POOR BOX.\r\n\r\nIt is not many years since, that in making some alterations in the\r\nparsonage of St. Michel du Valle, the workmen found under the flooring\r\nof one of the rooms a few small coins. They remembered that in the last\r\ncentury, a French priest, who had renounced his own religion, had been\r\nappointed curate of the parish by a non-resident Rector after having\r\nbeen duly licensed by the Bishop of Winchester; that, after leading a\r\nmost irregular life to the great scandal of the parishioners, he had\r\none day disappeared suddenly, and that after his departure the poor\r\nbox in the church was found to have been broken open and robbed of its\r\ncontents. It was not long before it was rumoured abroad that mysterious\r\nnoises were heard in the dead of the night in the parsonage, as of\r\nsomeone walking through the rooms and dropping money as he went. No one\r\ndoubted that the sacrilegious robber had left this mortal life, and\r\nthat his ghost was doomed to revisit the scene of his iniquity, vainly\r\nendeavouring to make restitution to the widows and orphans, and to the\r\naged and infirm pensioners of the church, of the money of which he had\r\nso unfeelingly deprived them.\r\n\r\nThe workmen were fully convinced that the coins which they had found\r\nwere part of those which had been so sacrilegiously abstracted. They\r\ndared not retain them for their own use, but brought them to the Rector\r\nwith a request that they might be given to the poor.[142]\r\n\r\n[142] From Mrs. Thomas Bell, wife of the Rector of the Vale parish.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURIAL OF THE DROWNED.\r\n\r\nIn all ages and among all nations the burial of the dead has been\r\nlooked upon as a sacred duty; and the belief is not yet extinct that\r\nuntil the body is consigned to the earth the spirit is doomed to wander\r\nabout, seeking rest and finding none.\r\n\r\nGreat therefore is the guilt of him who, having found a corpse,\r\nneglects to provide for its sepulture. “_Les morts recllament la terre,\r\net ch’est leû derouait._” (The dead claim the earth, and it is their\r\nright).\r\n\r\nA man who had gone down at low water to visit his nets, found a\r\ndead body stretched out on the sands. It was not that of any of his\r\nneighbours. A violent storm had raged a day or two previously, and\r\nthere could be no doubt that some unfortunate vessel had gone down in\r\nthe gale, and that the body before him was that of one of the crew.\r\nIt was handsomely dressed, the clothes being of velvet, richly laced\r\nwith gold. The avarice of the fisherman was excited, and his first\r\nthought was to search the pockets. A purse, containing what to a poor\r\nman was a considerable sum, was found, and, content with his morning’s\r\nwork, the man hastened home, leaving the body to be carried away by\r\nthe next tide. Great was his astonishment and affright, on entering\r\nhis cottage, to see the dead man seated by the fireside, and looking\r\nsternly and reproachfully at him. His wife, to whom the phantom was not\r\nvisible, perceived his trouble, and, pressed by her, he confessed what\r\nhe had done. She upbraided him with his inhuman conduct, and, kneeling\r\ndown with him, prayed the Almighty to forgive him his sin. They then\r\nhastened down to the beach, drew the corpse to shore, and buried it in\r\na neighbouring field. On their return home the ghost of the drowned man\r\nhad disappeared and was never more seen.[143]\r\n\r\n[143] From Mrs. Savidan.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--An old fisherman named Mansell told Major Macleane, my\r\ninformant, that it is most unlucky to keep a suit of clothes belonging\r\nto a drowned man, whether they have been washed ashore, or by whatever\r\nmeans they have entered your possession; for his spirit is sure to come\r\nback and reanimate his clothes and haunt you. The clothes should always\r\nbe burnt or buried immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LA GRAND’ GARCE.”\r\n\r\n“_Qu’est qu’tu ’as? Non dirait qu’tu ’as veu la grand’ garce._” (“What\r\nis the matter with you? One would suppose you had seen the great girl.”)\r\n\r\nSuch were the words with which a gentleman (Mr. Peter Le Pelley,\r\nSeigneur of Sark), in the last century greeted his sister-in-law, (Miss\r\nFrances Carey, daughter of Mr. John Carey), who had come to spend a few\r\ndays with him at his manorial residence in Sark, on her appearance at\r\nthe breakfast table the morning after her arrival. He meant to banter\r\nher on her anxious and haggard look, which she attributed to a restless\r\nnight and headache, occasioned in all probability by crossing the water\r\non the previous day.\r\n\r\nIn reality, although she did not like to acknowledge it at the time,\r\nher rest had been disturbed. Having previously locked her door, as was\r\nher habit, she had fallen asleep almost as soon as she laid her head on\r\nthe pillow, but was awakened suddenly,--about midnight, as far as she\r\ncould judge,--by someone drawing aside the curtains at the foot of her\r\nbed. She started up, and saw plainly an elderly lady standing there.\r\nShe fell back fainting, and when she recovered her senses the figure\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt was probably nothing more than a very vivid nightmare, and was\r\nfollowed by no results beyond the effects of the fright which a\r\nfew days sufficed to remove, but she never again revisited Sark.\r\nThe question, however, is one which is not unfrequently addressed\r\nto a person who has an anxious or startled look, and refers to the\r\napparition of a tall maiden, which is supposed to presage the death of\r\nthe person who sees it, or that of some near connection.[144]\r\n\r\n[144] From Rachel du Port, who was formerly a servant of Mr. John\r\nCarey, and heard it from Miss Fanny Carey herself.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nMy cousin, Miss E. Le Pelley, whose great-uncle Peter was Seigneur of\r\nSark, and whose old servant Caroline is still alive and in the service\r\nof the Le Pelley family, sends me the following confirmation of the\r\nabove, which she wrote down from the lips of old Caroline herself.\r\nCaroline, as a girl, had one day been teased by some of her fellow\r\nservants on the Seigneurie farm, who told her that they would come in\r\nand awake her during the night. So she, to prevent such disturbance,\r\nlocked her door. In the middle of the night she awoke and saw a lady\r\nstanding at the foot of her bed. She was so frightened that she shut\r\nher eyes, but twice curiosity prevailed and she opened them again,\r\nand saw the lady gliding away. She had on a crossover shawl, and a\r\nbeautifully gauffred white cap. Caroline was just going to look again,\r\nwhen she felt something heavy fall on her feet “with a great thump,”\r\nwhich so frightened her that she put her head under the clothes, and\r\ndid not uncover it until the morning, though she could not sleep again.\r\nThe lady is supposed to be a Miss de Carteret, sister of one of the\r\noriginal Seigneurs of Sark. She had unaccountably disappeared from that\r\nroom, which was the last spot in which she had been seen.\r\n\r\nOld Caroline went on to say that many others besides herself had\r\nseen the ghost. Fifty years previously, an old woman living at Havre\r\nGosselin had been terrified by it. The cook, who was fellow-servant\r\nwith Caroline, had seen it three times.\r\n\r\nHenri, an old man-servant, had also often seen it. But the curious\r\nthing about the ghost is that it only appears in the room if the door\r\nis _locked_.\r\n\r\nCaroline was very anxious to tell her mistress, Mrs. Le Pelley, what\r\nshe had seen, but the other servants dissuaded her, and told her that\r\nshe had brought it all on herself by locking her door, which she never\r\nagain dared to do.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Caroline, “if only someone had said to her ‘In the name of\r\nthe Great God what tortures you?’ the poor lady would have unburdened\r\nher soul, and her spirit could have found rest, but no one had the wit\r\nor the courage to do it.”\r\n\r\nAs Caroline always ends up her story:--“_Oh mon Dou donc, que j’tai\r\neffrâïe!_” (Oh my goodness, how frightened I was!).--_From Miss E. Le\r\nPelley._\r\n\r\nOld Mrs. Le Messurier, who used frequently to go in and “help” at the\r\nSeigneurie when the Le Pelleys were there, told me that she was there\r\nin February, 1839, the time that Peter Le Pelley was drowned, and the\r\nnight before “La Grande Garce” was seen walking through the passages,\r\nand the tapping of her high heels was heard through the house, while\r\nsome said she was wringing her hands. Knowing that her appearance in\r\nthis manner was a sure presage of misfortune, the servants all begged\r\nMr. Le Pelley next day not to set sail for Guernsey, especially as\r\nthere was a strong south wind blowing, but he would go, and the boat\r\nwas swamped off the Pointe du Nez, and all perished.--_From Mrs. Le\r\nMessurier, of Sark._\r\n\r\nMr. de Garis, of the Rouvets, told me that he had an old servant who\r\ncame from Sark, who told him of a lady who appeared at the Seigneurie,\r\nif the bedroom door was locked.\r\n\r\nIn 1565 Queen Elizabeth “conferred on Helier de Carteret and his heirs\r\nfor ever, in reward of the many services received by herself and her\r\nroyal ancestors from this family, the aforesaid island of Sark, to be\r\nheld _in capite_, as a fief haubert, on the payment of an annual rent\r\nof fifty shillings.” Sir Charles de Carteret, Seigneur of St. Ouen,\r\nand of Sark, being heavily in debt, made a provision in his will for\r\nthe settling of his debts by ordering that at his death the Seigneurie\r\nof Sark should be sold. This will bears the date of 1713. During his\r\nlifetime he obtained a patent from Queen Anne authorising the above\r\nsale. And in 1730 it was bought by Dame Susan Le Gros, widow of Mr.\r\nNicholas Le Pelley. Her son Nicholas inherited it, and it remained in\r\nthe Le Pelleys’ possession until 1852, when, owing to heavy losses\r\nincurred in the working of the silver mines in Little Sark, they sold\r\nit to Mrs. T. G. Collings, and it is now in the possession of the\r\nCollings family.\r\n\r\n\r\n“LA FLLIEUR DE JAON.”\r\n\r\nThere is an English saying that “when the gorse is out of bloom,\r\nkissing is out of fashion.” This is expanded in Guernsey into the\r\nfollowing tales.\r\n\r\nA man, who had been long suffering from a lingering illness, was\r\nat last lying on his death-bed. His wife was unremitting in her\r\nattentions, and profuse in her expressions of sorrow at the thoughts\r\nof losing him. He did not doubt her affection for him, but ventured\r\nto hint at the probability of her looking out for a second husband\r\nbefore the first year of her widowhood should be expired. She warmly\r\nrepudiated the bare possibility of such a thought entering her mind,\r\nand was ready to make a vow that she would never again enter into the\r\nmarried state.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the man mildly, “I ask no more than that you should\r\npromise me not to wed again while any blossom can be found on the\r\nfurze.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Harbour, showing entrance to Cow Lane.”]\r\n\r\nShe gladly made promise. The man died, but it is affirmed that the\r\ndisconsolate widow, at the end of twelve months, had discovered by\r\nclose observation, and to her great disappointment, that she had made\r\na rash promise, and that there was not a day in the whole year when\r\nflowers might not be found on the prickly gorse.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.\r\n\r\nOther Editor’s notes on this subject will be found in Appendix A.\r\n\r\nIn the Castel parish they tell another story based on the same proverb.\r\nHere is a house called Les Mourains, in that parish, belonging to\r\nthe Ozannes. In the middle of the last century, a Mr. Ozanne married\r\na young wife, who died after having given birth to two sons. On her\r\ndeath-bed she made her husband promise that he would never marry,\r\n“_lorsqu’il y avait des fllieurs sur l’ jan_.” He promised, but after\r\nher death he married again.\r\n\r\nBut the poor spirit had not found rest. The nurse, while she dressed\r\nand undressed the children, frequently saw her late mistress watching\r\nher. The other servants, when in the evenings they stood at the back\r\ndoor talking to their friends and acquaintances, heard the rustling of\r\nher silk dress along the passages.\r\n\r\nAnd she so habitually haunted the drawing room that for years it had\r\nto be kept locked up, and finally the Rector of the parish had to be\r\nsent for, to lay the ghost, which he did, and it was boarded up in a\r\ncupboard. The place may be conjectured, for in the drawing room there\r\nis still a part boarded up, and at times strange noises are heard, as\r\nof a spirit ill at rest.[145]\r\n\r\n[145] From Miss E. Le Pelley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nWitchcraft.\r\n\r\n    “Had learned the art that none may name\r\n    In Padua far beyond the sea.”\r\n\r\n                “Tam saw an unco sight!\r\n    Warlocks and witches in a dance;\r\n    Nae cotillon brent new frae France,\r\n    But horn pipes, gigs, strathspeys, and reels,\r\n    Put life and mettle in their heels:\r\n    … There sat auld Nick, in shape o’ beast;\r\n    A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large,\r\n    To gie them music was his charge.”\r\n\r\n                        --_Tam O’Shanter_, Burns.\r\n\r\n    “Wise judges have prescribed that men may not rashly\r\n    believe the confessions of witches, nor the evidence\r\n    against them. For the witches themselves are imaginative,\r\n    and people are credulous, and ready to impute accidents to\r\n    witchcraft.”--_Bacon._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe belief in witchcraft dates from so very remote a period, it is so\r\nuniversally spread throughout all the various races that compose the\r\nhuman family, that it is not to be wondered at if it still retains its\r\nhold among the ignorant and semi-educated, especially when we find,\r\neven in the present day, that persons, who ought by their superior\r\ninstruction, and by the position they hold in society, to be above\r\nsuch superstitions, are nevertheless, firm believers in judicial\r\nastrology, fortune telling, spiritualism, and other similar delusions.\r\nAlthough it is now but very seldom that public rumour goes so far\r\nas to point out any particular individual as a proficient in this\r\nforbidden art, the persuasion that sorcery does still exist, is by no\r\nmeans extinct. A sudden and unusual malady, either in man or beast, a\r\nstrange and unlooked-for accident, the failure of crops from blight\r\nor insects,--all these, and many more evils, are attributed by the\r\nignorant to supernatural causes; and, it is probable, will continue\r\nto be so as long as there are those who find it their interest to\r\nencourage this superstitious belief. For there are individuals,\r\ncommonly called “désorceleurs” or “white-witches,” who pretend to be\r\nable to declare whether a person is bewitched or not, and to have it\r\nin their power, by charms and incantations, to counteract the evil\r\ninfluence. Of course this is not to be done for nothing; and cases of\r\nthis kind, where large sums of money have been extorted from ignorant\r\ndupes, have, even of late years, formed the subject of judicial\r\ninvestigation. It is useless to attempt to reason with the lower orders\r\non this subject. They have an answer ready which, in their minds at\r\nleast, is a conclusive reply to all doubts that may be suggested:--\r\n\r\n“Witches and witchcraft are frequently spoken of in the Holy\r\nScriptures; who, then, but an unbeliever, can doubt that such things\r\nare?”\r\n\r\nGuernsey did not escape the epidemic delusion which spread over the\r\nwhole of Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, a terror seized upon the people, and no man thought himself\r\nsecure from the machinations of the agents of Satan. The records of\r\nthe Royal Court of the island contain far too many condemnations of\r\nunfortunate men and women to the stake for sorcery; and the evidence\r\non which the sentences against them were based, as well as their own\r\nconfessions, extorted under the infliction of torture, and taken down\r\nin writing at the time, are still extant. The unhappy individuals were\r\nof various ages and conditions, but, judging from the statements of\r\ntheir accusers, and the evidence brought against them, they appear\r\nto have been in most, if not all cases, persons of irregular life,\r\nsubsisting by begging and pilfering, vindictive towards those who\r\noffended them, and clever in taking advantage of, and working on, the\r\nfears and preconceived notions of their dupes.\r\n\r\nThey were accused of causing storms to arise, in which the unfortunate\r\nfisherman who had refused them a share of his catch, either lost\r\nhis boat, his gear, or his life; or was so tempest-tossed as to be\r\nin danger of losing his wits. Women and children were, by their\r\ninfernal influence, afflicted with sudden and strange maladies. Oxen,\r\nhorses, calves, sheep, and swine died unexpectedly, the cows calved\r\nprematurely, and either gave no milk, or else blood in lieu of it.\r\nButter would not come, or became rancid even while it was being made,\r\nand curds dissolved and turned to whey.\r\n\r\nMaggots of unusual appearance, black at both extremities, appeared in\r\nprodigious quantities in the beds, and even under the women’s caps, and\r\nlice were in such numbers that they could be swept away with a broom.\r\n\r\nThe water in the fountains--usually so bright and limpid--became turbid\r\nand unfit for use, and full of tadpoles and disgusting insects. Frogs\r\nand black beasts (“_des bêtes noires_”), whatever they may have been,\r\nsat by the bedside of those who were under a spell; but all these evils\r\ndisappear as suddenly as they have come, either on the sufferer weakly\r\nyielding to the demands of the supposed sorcerer, or having courage\r\nenough to threaten to denounce him to the judicial authorities.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that the pretended wizards and witches\r\nshould have shrunk from a judicial investigation at a time when all\r\nbelieved firmly in their supernatural powers, and when the examination\r\ninto the alleged facts was carried on in a manner so different from\r\nthe procedure of the present day, hearsay evidence of the vaguest\r\ndescription being admitted as proof, and when that failed, torture\r\nbeing resorted to in order to extort a confession.\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence given, and the confessions of the sorcerers\r\nthemselves, it appears that the means employed by them to effect their\r\nnefarious designs were various; but two in particular are mentioned.\r\n\r\nA peculiar black powder, furnished them by their master, the Devil,\r\nwhich, being cast on man or beast, was the cause of serious and unusual\r\nmaladies; and certain enchanted articles, introduced furtively into the\r\nbeds or pillows of those on whom they wished to practise their evil\r\narts.\r\n\r\nThese charms are variously described by the witnesses as consisting of\r\nseeds of different kinds, of which mildewed or blighted beans seem to\r\nhave been the most common, and of feathers, knotted together with ends\r\nof thread or silk twist, and sometimes made into the shape of a small\r\nimage.\r\n\r\nWhen the beds or pillows were opened to search for these articles, it\r\nsometimes happened that an animal was seen to leave the bed, which,\r\nafter taking various forms, as that of a black cat, a cock, a rat, a\r\nmouse, or a stoat, succeeded in evading all attempts to catch it, and\r\nescaped in a mysterious manner.\r\n\r\nIsabell Le Moigne, one of the witches, declared in her confession\r\nthat this was none other than Satan himself. If these charms were\r\nthrown into the fire, they produced a most noisome smell, but, in some\r\ninstances, the immediate cure of the sufferer was the result. If the\r\nperson under the influence of witchcraft was uncertain on whom he ought\r\nto fix the guilt of bewitching him, there was an infallible method for\r\ndiscovering the culprit.\r\n\r\nThe house-key was to be placed on the hearth-stone, and the fire heaped\r\naround it. As it became hot, the wizard or witch, apparently suffering\r\ngreat agony, would come to the door, and endeavour to force an entrance\r\ninto the house, offering at the same time to put an end to the spell\r\nunder which the inmates were bound.\r\n\r\nAnother means of finding out the guilty party was to roast the\r\nheart of some animal--some said that of a black sheep was the most\r\nefficacious--with certain prescribed rites and incantations, or to\r\nboil it with certain herbs known to the white witch or “désorceleur,”\r\nwho, of course, could not be expected to give his valuable advice and\r\nservices for nothing.\r\n\r\nAccording to the confessions of the unfortunate victims of the\r\nsuperstition and credulity of their times, to which allusion has been\r\nmade above, the doings of Satan with them were just such as we read of\r\nin the accounts of prosecutions for witchcraft in other countries. A\r\ndesire to be revenged on some persons who had given them offence seems\r\nto have been the first motive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “North Arm, Old Harbour, showing back of Pollet.”]\r\n\r\nThe Devil then appeared to them in the shape of a black dog, cat, or\r\nother animal, sometimes under one likeness, sometimes under another;\r\noffered his services, invited them to attend the “Sabbath,” which\r\nwas generally held in some weird, out-of-the-way locality; furnished\r\nthem with a certain ointment, which was to be rubbed on the back and\r\nstomach; after doing which, they found themselves carried through the\r\nair, with extraordinary velocity, to the appointed place of meeting,\r\nwhere they found other wizards and witches, and a number of imps in the\r\nshape of dogs, cats, and hares. They were unable to recognise the other\r\nsorcerers on account of their all appearing blackened and disfigured,\r\nbut they knew who they were by their answering to their names when the\r\nroll was called over by Satan before entering on the business of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThey commenced by adoring their infernal master in a manner which it\r\nis not necessary to describe minutely. They then danced back to back,\r\nafter which they were regaled with bread and wine, which Satan poured\r\nout of silver or pewter flagons into goblets of the same metals. They\r\nall agreed in describing the wine as being inferior to that usually\r\ndrunk; and they asserted that salt was never seen at these feasts.\r\nThe Devil, before dismissing the assembly, gave them a certain black\r\npowder, of which we have spoken before.\r\n\r\nThe favourite form assumed by Satan on these occasions seems to have\r\nbeen that of a large black dog, standing upright on his hind legs, but\r\nhe sometimes appeared in the shape of a he-goat.\r\n\r\nIsabell Le Moigne described him as a black dog of large size, with\r\nlong erect horns, and hands like those of a man. Deeds were done\r\nat the Sabbath which will not bear being spoken of; but there are\r\ncircumstances which lead one to suppose that the poor deluded wretches\r\nof women may, in some cases, have been deceived by designing men, who\r\nenticed them from their houses at night, and, under assumed disguises,\r\nabused their credulity.\r\n\r\nAll sorcerers were marked by Satan in some part or other of the body,\r\nand the mark thus made was insensible to pain, and bloodless.\r\n\r\nOne of the witches asserted that the Devil, before her enlistment into\r\nhis service, required of her the gift of some living animal, and that\r\nshe presented him with a young fowl. The next night at the Sabbath,\r\nwhither she was conveyed through the air after having duly anointed her\r\nbody with the ointment given her by the Devil, she was made to renounce\r\nthe Holy Trinity, and to promise obedience to her infernal master.\r\nIt appeared also from the confessions that if the servants of Satan\r\nrefused to do his behests, they are beaten and otherwise maltreated by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the evidence given in many of the trials for\r\nwitchcraft that the accused, in a majority of cases, were persons\r\nwho trafficked on the ignorance and credulity of the people, and who\r\nencouraged the idea of their being possessed of supernatural powers so\r\nlong as they found it profitable to do so.\r\n\r\nEven in the present day there are people who are afraid to refuse to\r\ngive alms to a beggar, lest an evil eye should be cast upon them;\r\nand who can say how many deaths of cattle and pigs, attributed to\r\nwitchcraft, may not have been caused by poison adroitly administered\r\nout of revenge for a supposed injury?\r\n\r\nIn their nocturnal flights through the air to their appointed place\r\nof meeting with the Demon, witches were said to utter loud cries;\r\nand persons may, perhaps, still be found ready to affirm that in\r\ntempestuous nights, when the wind was howling round their dwellings,\r\nthey have been able to distinguish above all the tumult of the\r\nelements, the unearthly cry of “_Har-hèri[146]! qué-hou-hou! Sabbat!\r\nSabbat._” This cry is attributed to the “_gens du hocq_” or “_gens du\r\nVendredi_,” as they are called by those whose prudence deters them\r\nfrom speaking of “sorciers” and “sorcières,” lest the use of such\r\noffensive epithets should give umbrage. It is believed, too, that in\r\ntheir assemblies on Friday nights on the hill of Catiôroc, around the\r\ncromlech called “Le Trepied,” or on the sands of Rocquaine Bay, they\r\ndance to a roundelay, the burden of which is “_Qué-hou-hou! Marie\r\nLihou!_” Some suppose that these words are uttered in defiance of the\r\nBlessed Virgin Mary, in whose honour the church and priory were erected\r\nand dedicated by the name of Notre Dame, Ste. Marie de Lihou. They are\r\nnow a heap of shapeless ruins, but the place must have been looked upon\r\nas one of peculiar sanctity, for even down to the present day French\r\ncoasting vessels passing by salute it by lowering their topmast. It is\r\nnot then to be wondered at if the infernal sisterhood--one of whose\r\nchief amusements, as is well known, is the raising of storms in which\r\nmany a proud vessel goes down--should take a particular delight in\r\ninsulting the “Star of the Sea,” the kind and ever-watchful guardian\r\nof the poor mariner.\r\n\r\nWizards and witches are supposed to have the power of navigating on the\r\nsea in egg-shells, and on the blade-bones of animals. It is to prevent\r\nthis improper use of them that the spoon is always thrust through the\r\negg-shell after eating its contents, and that a hole is made through\r\nthe blade-bone before throwing it away.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that witches have the power of assuming the shape of\r\nvarious animals, and many stories turn on the exercise of this supposed\r\nfaculty. The favourite forms with them appear to be those of cats,\r\nhares, and “cahouettes”[147] or red-legged choughs. It is not easy\r\nto conjecture how this beautiful and harmless bird got into such bad\r\ncompany; perhaps its predilection for the wild and unfrequented cliffs\r\nand headlands, where the witches are supposed to hold their unholy\r\nmeetings, may have gained it the reputation of being in alliance with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn Guernsey, as elsewhere, a horseshoe, nailed on the lintel, door,\r\nor threshold, or on the mast or any other part of a ship or boat, is\r\nsupposed to be a sure preservative against witchcraft, and, although\r\na black cat is one of the most frequent disguises assumed by Satan’s\r\nimps and servants, the household in which a cat without a single white\r\nhair is domesticated, is thought to be highly favoured, as none of the\r\ninfernal gang will venture to molest it. As some persons are fully\r\npersuaded that every black cat, however tame and well-behaved it may\r\nappear to be, is in reality in league with the Prince of Darkness, it\r\nmay be that any interference on the part of others of the fraternity is\r\ncontrary to the rules established among them, and resented accordingly,\r\nthe old saying that “two of a trade cannot agree,” holding good in this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to those who have an interest in encouraging\r\na belief in witchcraft, and there is no doubt that persons who, for\r\nsome reason or other, enjoy the unenviable reputation of dabbling\r\nin this forbidden art, now that they have no longer the fear of the\r\nstake and faggot before their eyes, and have only the minor terrors\r\nof a Police Court to dread, are not altogether unwilling to brave the\r\nlatter danger if, by working on the credulity of the ignorant and\r\nsuperstitious, they can extort money, or even command a certain amount\r\nof consideration as the possessors of supernatural powers.\r\n\r\nFew would venture in the present day to acknowledge openly that they\r\ncould injure their neighbours by the exercise of unholy arts; but many\r\nmay be found who pretend to a secret knowledge which may be used for\r\nbeneficent purposes.\r\n\r\nThe difference, however, between a true witch--the servant of\r\nSatan--and what is commonly called “a white witch,” has never been\r\nclearly defined. The latter is known in Guernsey by the name of\r\n“désorceleresse” or “désorceleur,” for the art is quite as frequently,\r\nif not more frequently, exercised by men than by women. The persons\r\nwho practise it pretend to be able to declare whether man or beast\r\nis suffering from the effects of witchcraft, to discover who it is\r\nthat has cast the spell, and, by means of spells and incantations, to\r\ncounteract the evil influence. It is clear, however, that one who is\r\nin possession of such powers must himself have a very intimate and\r\nprofound knowledge of the arts he is fighting against, and that, if\r\noffended, he may perhaps be tempted to practise them. The “désorceleur”\r\nthus is as much feared as trusted, and as, of course, he cannot be\r\nexpected to give his valuable services for nothing, the profession\r\nis often found to be very remunerative, large sums of money, besides\r\npresents in kind, being sometimes extorted from the superstition and\r\nfears of the credulous dupes.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, however, that some of these pretenders have some\r\nskill in the cure of the diseases to which cattle are liable, and\r\neven that some of the minor ailments to which the human race are\r\nsubject, are occasionally relieved by them, especially those--and among\r\nignorant, uneducated people they are not few--which arise out of a\r\ndisordered imagination. The habits of close observation which those\r\nof his profession acquire must needs give the “désorceleur” a great\r\ninsight into character; his cunning will soon teach him how to work\r\non the fears and credulity of those who come to consult him, and his\r\nexperience will guide him into the best way of exercising his knowledge.\r\n\r\nHow far the so-called white-witches are believers in their own\r\nsupernatural powers is an open question. It may be that, in making use\r\nof certain forms or practices which they have learned from others, they\r\nmay be fully persuaded in their own minds of their efficacy, it may be\r\nthat in some cases they are labouring under a sort of hallucination.\r\n\r\nA noted bone-setter, who, it is said, was occasionally resorted to when\r\nman or beast was supposed to be under evil influence, or when it was\r\nsought to discover the perpetration of a theft, used to account for\r\nhis pretended knowledge of the anatomy of the human body by asserting\r\nsolemnly that this knowledge had been revealed to him in a vision from\r\nHeaven, and he had repeated this story so often that it was evident to\r\nhis hearers that he had come at last to believe fully in the truth of\r\nwhat he said.\r\n\r\nThe rustic bone-setter is not necessarily a “désorceleur,” although,\r\nas in the instance just noticed, the two professions may be combined;\r\nbut he is skilled in the cure of those somewhat mysterious ailments\r\nknown as “une veine trésaillie,” which seems to be a sprain or strain,\r\nand “les côtaïs bas,” which may be defined as that sort of dyspeptic\r\naffection which the lower orders call a “sinking of the stomach” or\r\n“all-overness.” This ailment is supposed popularly to be caused by the\r\nribs slipping out of their place, and is cured by manipulation and\r\npushing them gradually back into their proper position. The efficacy\r\nof friction properly applied in reducing a sprain is well known, and\r\naccounts for the frequent success of the bone-setter in the treatment\r\nof “veines trésaillies.”\r\n\r\nSome of these practitioners--old women as well as men--pretend to\r\nhave the gift of causing warts to disappear by counting them, and\r\nasking certain questions of the persons applying to them for relief.\r\nThe principal information they seem to wish to arrive at is the age\r\nof the person; and this known, they predict that the warts are likely\r\nto disappear within a certain time. As these unsightly excrescences\r\naffect more particularly young persons, and as it is known that they\r\nfrequently disappear naturally at that age when youth is passing into\r\nmanhood, it is not unlikely that this fact may have been observed, and\r\nthe knowledge of it turned to account. It is believed that those who\r\npossess the secret may impart it to one, and to one only; but they must\r\nreceive neither fee nor reward for so doing; for if they do, or if they\r\ntell it to more than one, they lose their power of curing. They must\r\nnot receive money for their services, but if a cure is effected they\r\nare at liberty to take a present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Town Harbour, from an old picture.”]\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, fortune-telling forms no small part of the\r\nwhite-witch’s profession, although all do not practise it, and some\r\nconfine themselves to this particular branch alone. Cards seem to be\r\nnow the principal means used for prying into the secrets of futurity,\r\nbut other appliances have been used, and may, perhaps, still be used by\r\nsome, such as the detection of a thief by means of a Bible and key.\r\n\r\nA sort of rhabdomancy, or divination by small rods, shuffled together\r\nwith certain ceremonies and charms, and then thrown on the ground, was\r\nused by a sort of half-demented creature called Collas Roussé, about\r\nthe end of the last century.\r\n\r\nHe is said to have had a good deal of shrewdness, to have been very\r\nquick at repartee, and to have had great facility in expressing himself\r\nin rhymed sentences. He appears to have believed that he was really\r\nin possession of supernatural knowledge, and as his assumption of\r\nextraordinary powers gained credence with the vulgar, he found it an\r\neasy task to make a profit of their credulity. It is reported of him\r\nthat when brought to justice for some gross act of imposition, he had\r\nthe audacity to threaten his judges with the effects of his vengeance.\r\nHis threats, however, did not deter the magistrates from sentencing him\r\nto exposure in the cage on a market day, with his divining apparatus\r\nby his side. He bore his punishment bravely, and entertained the\r\nmultitude who crowded to see him with rhyming remarks. Another species\r\nof rhabdomancy is the use of the divining rod, the efficacy of which is\r\nfully believed in, not only for the discovery of springs of water, but\r\nalso for the revealing of the spot where treasure has been concealed;\r\nand, if the stories that are told are all to be depended upon, there is\r\nevidence sufficient to stagger the sturdiest unbeliever.\r\n\r\nA country gentleman, now dead, whom nobody who knew him took for a\r\nconjurer, was particularly renowned for his skill in this art. Not only\r\ncould he tell by means of the rod where a spring of water was to be\r\nfound, and to what depth it would be necessary to dig before coming to\r\nit, but he could also discover in what part of a field or house money\r\nor plate had been hidden. In order, however, to perform this last feat,\r\nit is necessary that the rod should be previously touched with metal\r\nof the same kind as that to be sought for. It is only in the hands of\r\nsome few favoured individuals that the rod works, and even then it\r\ndoes so in various degrees; with some, being violently agitated, with\r\nothers, moving slowly, and sometimes imperceptibly. The art of holding\r\nthe forked stick may be taught to anyone, but unless a natural aptitude\r\nexists, the rod remains inert in the grasp of the holder.\r\n\r\nA portion of the confessions of some of the unfortunate victims who\r\nsuffered at the stake in 1617, translated from the records preserved\r\nin the Register Office of the Royal Court of Guernsey, will be given\r\nas a specimen of the absurdities to which credence could be given in a\r\nsuperstitious age.[148]\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be forgotten that the island did not stand alone\r\nin this belief. No part of Europe seems to have escaped the absurd\r\ndread of witchcraft, which, like a pestilence, spread from one nation\r\nto another, and from which even the most learned of the age, men of\r\nprofound thought, did not escape. One curious fact may be noticed; the\r\npractices imputed to the accused, who were for the most part of the\r\nlowest and most ignorant classes of society, and to which in numberless\r\ninstances they confessed, appear to have been nearly identical in all\r\ncountries. The inference is that they must have been handed down from a\r\nvery remote period, and that they were in use among the pretenders to\r\nmagical arts and supernatural powers among our pagan ancestors; just\r\nas in the present day we find similar ideas and practices existing\r\namong savage tribes, and in semi-civilised countries where the light of\r\nChristianity has not yet penetrated. It is well known how difficult it\r\nis to wean a people from their primitive belief, and how prone they are\r\nto cling to it in secret. Is it not possible that some secret society\r\nmay have existed for ages after the spread of the Gospel in which\r\nheathen practices may have been perpetuated?\r\n\r\n[146] _Ké_, _Gué_ or _Tié_ and _Hou_ are epithets applied to the Deity\r\nin the Bas Breton. MS. Note by Mr. George Métivier.\r\n\r\n“_Sabot-Daim_--a witch hornpipe.” (Idem.)\r\n\r\n[147] Mr. Métivier, in his _Dictionnaire Franco-Normand_, has a long\r\narticle on “cahouettes.” He says:--\r\n\r\n“They play, in neo-latin mythology, a very interesting part, even\r\nto-day some traces of which are to be found. Wizards and witches,\r\naccording to the councils, disguised themselves formerly as ‘cahouets’\r\nand ‘cahouettes.’ Raphaël, Archbishop of Nicosie, capital of the island\r\nof Cyprus, in the year 1251, excommunicated all the ‘cahouets’ and\r\nthe ‘cahouettes’ as well as those who supported and encouraged games\r\nof chance.--(_Constitutions_, _ch._ 15). And the Council of Nîmes,\r\nthirty years after, treats in the same manner witches and sooth sayers,\r\n‘coavets’ and ‘coavettes.’\r\n\r\n“In the hierarchy of Mithras, that type of the rising sun which\r\nbewitched the Gauls, the deacon, or minister was entitled ‘corneille’\r\nor _rook_; and on the first day of the year, according to Porphyry, the\r\ninitiates disguised themselves severally as beasts and birds.”\r\n\r\nMr. Métivier ends by citing two authorities on ancient traditions\r\nconcerning these birds.\r\n\r\n“Le corbeau est consacré à Apollon, et il est son ministre (_famulus_),\r\nvoilà pourquoi il possède la faculté de prédire.” _Gérard Jean Voss_,\r\n_liv._ 3, _sur l’Idolâtrie_.\r\n\r\n“Je crois que ces cérémonies se célébraient près de Coptos, ville dont\r\nle nom était si fameux, et d’où vient l’Egypte.

Sir Edgar\r\nMacCulloch had copied out the depositions of the witnesses on loose\r\nsheets of paper, evidently meaning to incorporate them into his book.\r\nThe “Confession of the Witches” in his MS. follows his essay on\r\nWitchcraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n15TH MAY, 1581.\r\n\r\nKatherine Eustace and her daughter were accused by common consent of\r\npractising the art of witchcraft in the island.\r\n\r\nThe wife of Collas Cousin deposed that having refused to give milk to\r\nthe accused, saying that there were poorer people to whom she would\r\nrather give, her cow then gave blood instead of milk.\r\n\r\nJohan Le Roux deposed that having been seized with great pains in his\r\nknee, he believed himself to be bewitched by Katherine Eustace, so his\r\nwife went to the latter and threatened to denounce her to the Royal\r\nCourt; after that he got better.\r\n\r\n\r\n28TH OCTOBER, 1581.\r\n\r\nRobert Asheley, found dead in the garden behind St. Peter Port\r\nparsonage, suspected of having committed suicide by shooting himself\r\nwith an arquebus. This having been proved according to the law, the\r\nCourt, after hearing the speech made by Her Majesty’s Procureur, found\r\nthat the said Robert Asheley shall be carried to some unfrequented spot\r\nand there buried, a heap of stones being placed on his body,[149] and\r\nthus he shall be deprived of burial in the spot where Christian remains\r\nare placed; and that all his goods shall be confiscate to Her Majesty\r\nthe Queen.\r\n\r\n[149] EDITOR’S NOTE.--See in “Hamlet,” where the priest refuses\r\nChristian burial to Ophelia as a suicide, and commands:--“Shards,\r\nflints, and pebbles should be thrown upon her.”\r\n\r\nIt has been conjectured that these heaps of stones were placed upon\r\ngraves, more especially of criminals and suicides, to keep the spirit\r\nin the earth, and prevent the ghost from walking. Hence the modern\r\ngravestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n25TH FEBRUARY, 1583.\r\n\r\nCollas de la Rue is accused of using the arts of witchcraft, and of\r\ngrievously vexing and tormenting divers subjects of Her Majesty.\r\n\r\nMatthieu Cauchez deposed that his wife being in a pining languorous\r\ncondition, having heard that Collas de la Rue was a wizard, and knowing\r\nthat he frequently visited his house, he asked him if he could help\r\nhis wife. Collas replied:--\r\n\r\n“As to her she is an ‘in pace’ (sic), she will not live much longer.”\r\n\r\nDe la Rue came to the place where his wife lay ill, and caused the bed\r\nto be reversed, putting the bolster at the foot; she died three hours\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nJames Blanche affirmed that having failed in a promise he had made\r\nto De la Rue, the latter swore he should repent. His wife soon\r\nafterwards became swollen all over, in which state she remained for\r\nsome considerable time. He finally went to De la Rue, and consulted him\r\nas to how to cure his wife, and he gave him a decoction of herbs to be\r\nused as a drink, by which his wife was cured.\r\n\r\nThomas Behot deposed that on returning from fishing, he refused to give\r\nsome fish to the son of Collas De la Rue. The son said he was a “false\r\nvillain,” and complained to his father, who on that said, “_Tais-toy,\r\nil n’en peschera plus guères_.” (“Be quiet, he will not catch many\r\nmore.”) That same day he was taken ill, and became so swollen that he\r\ncould not rest between his sheets--(en ses draps). After having been\r\nill for a long time, his wife unsewed his mattress and found therein\r\nseveral sorts of grains, such as broom, “alisandre” “nocillons” or\r\n“nerillons de fèves,” (black beans?), the treadles of sheep, pieces\r\nof laurel, rags with feathers stuck into them,[150] and several other\r\nthings. His wife threw it all into the fire, and such an awful smell\r\narose from the flames that they were obliged to leave the room, and\r\nimmediately his swelling disappeared. The same day he was taken with\r\nsuch violent pains that he thought his last hour was come. Whereupon\r\nhis wife put the key of their front door in the fire, and, as soon as\r\nit began to get red hot, Collas de la Rue, who had not been invited,\r\nand who had not put foot inside their house for six years, arrived\r\nthere before sunrise, and said that he would undertake to cure him,\r\nbut that it would be a lengthy operation, that he would have to refer\r\nto a book that he had at home, by which he had cured several people,\r\nMatthieu Cauchez among others, and that also he (the witness) would be\r\ncured. So Collas made him some poultices of herbs, but they did not\r\ncure him. With great difficulty he dragged himself to St. Martin’s\r\nChurch (au temple de St. Martin), where De la Rue said to him:--\r\n\r\n“I am glad to see you here, and yet not entirely glad, for you are not\r\nyet cured.”\r\n\r\nWhen the deponent replied that he soon hoped to be on the sea again, De\r\nla Rue replied:\r\n\r\n“Do not go, for you will not return without great danger.” (“N’y vas\r\npas, car à grand’ peine en reviendras tu.”)\r\n\r\nHowever, he persisted in going, and encountered such bad weather that\r\nhe and all the crew were nearly drowned. And returning very ill, and\r\nhis malady continuing, his wife again unsewed his mattress and there\r\nfound an image made of a bone-like substance and apparently all gnawed,\r\n(d’une manière d’os tout rongé) which he took to the magistrates, and\r\nafterwards got better.\r\n\r\nCollas De la Rue also told him that Collas Rouget had gone to Normandy\r\nto seek a cure. Had he only consulted him first, he need not have gone\r\nso far to be cured. In conclusion he said that on his conscience he\r\nbelieved and affirmed the said De la Rue to be a wizard.\r\n\r\nRichard de Vauriouf deposed that having had several differences with\r\nCollas De la Rue on the subject of his cattle, which had caused him\r\nannoyance, De la Rue said to him:\r\n\r\n“You are very strong and active, but before long you will not be thus,\r\nand you will be humbled after another manner.” (“Tu es bien robuste et\r\nfort, mais avant qu’il soit guères ce ne sera pas ainsy, et tu seras\r\nautrement abaissé.”)\r\n\r\nVery soon afterwards the said Vauriouf was taken ill, and so was one of\r\nhis daughters, and he was weak and languishing for more than a month.\r\n\r\nPierre Tardif, who had had some law-suits with Collas De la Rue,\r\ndeposed that thereupon his daughter was taken ill, and her mattress\r\nbeing searched they found several … (here and in various places the\r\nrecord is torn) … of several kinds, and being … made principally of a\r\ncoloured silken thread and of … of broom, of beans cut up, two of them\r\nbeing black … a pin stuck in a piece of rag and … After having taken\r\nadvice he (Tardif) had thrashed De la Rue … after having given him two\r\nknock-down blows, his daughter was all right again. After which she was\r\nagain taken ill, so he searched for De la Rue, and, having found him,\r\nhe again thrashed him, this time drawing blood, and shortly after that\r\nhis daughter was cured. In conclusion he also deposed upon oath his\r\nbelief that De la Rue was a wizard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Royal Court House in 1880.”]\r\n\r\n… deposed as to having heard Collas De la Rue say that he had means to\r\nsilence those who spoke ill of him (“qu’il avait des moyens de faire\r\ntaire ceux qui parloient mal de luy.”)\r\n\r\n(The record is here again torn, and the trial apparently did not\r\nconclude, but in 1585 the proceedings against Collas De la Rue were\r\nrecommenced and many of the same witnesses appeared).\r\n\r\n[150] EDITOR’S NOTE.--In a letter called “Voudouism in Virginia,”\r\nquoted by Mr. Moncure D. Conway in his book on _Demonology and\r\nDevil-Lore_, Vol. I., p. 69., the following similar superstition is\r\nnoticed. “If an ignorant negro is smitten with a disease which he\r\ncannot comprehend, he often imagines himself the victim of witchcraft,\r\nand, having no faith in ‘white folks’ physic’ for such ailments,\r\nmust apply to one of these quacks. A physician residing near this\r\ncity (Richmond), was invited by such a one to witness his mode of\r\nprocedure with a dropsical patient for whom the physician in question\r\nhad occasionally charitably prescribed. On the coverlet of the bed on\r\nwhich the sick man lay, was spread a quantity of bones, feathers and\r\nother trash. The charlatan went through with a series of so-called\r\nconjurations, burned feathers, hair, and tiny fragments of wood\r\nin a charcoal furnace, and mumbled gibberish past the physician’s\r\ncomprehension. He then proceeded to rip open the pillows and bolsters,\r\nand took from them some queer conglomerations of feathers. These he\r\nsaid had caused all the trouble. Sprinkling a whitish powder over them\r\nhe burnt them in his furnace. A black offensive smoke was produced, and\r\nhe announced triumphantly that the evil influence was destroyed and\r\nthat the patient would surely get well. He died not many days later,\r\nbelieving, in common with all his friends and relatives, that the\r\nconjurations of the ‘trick doctor’ had failed to save him only because\r\nresorted to too late.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL OF COLLAS DE LA RUE RESUMED.\r\n\r\n17TH DECEMBER, 1585.\r\n\r\nCollas Hugues appeared in person and showed his child to us in the\r\nCourt. This said child cannot talk except at random and with an\r\nimpediment in its speech that none can cure; and he declares his\r\nconviction that his said child is “detained” (detenu) by some wizard,\r\nand he will take his oath that it is Collas De la Rue who “detains”\r\nhim, inasmuch that the latter threatened him that he would afflict\r\nhim through his most precious treasure (du plus cher joyau qu’il peut\r\navoir). On this declaration, Her Majesty’s Procureur testified to us\r\nthat the said De la Rue had formerly been imprisoned for sorcery, and\r\nnow, that though he had not always been proved guilty, yet that to all\r\noutward appearance he had practised the art of witchcraft, and so much\r\nso, that new complaints being made against him, he had demanded the\r\narrest and the confiscation of the goods of the said De la Rue, which\r\nwas granted.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of December an investigation was ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, 1585.\r\n\r\nJames Blanche affirms that on a certain day, having promised to go\r\nfor a day’s work to the aforesaid De la Rue, and not having done so,\r\nthat he was heard to say to one of his people, that he, Blanche,\r\nshould repent, and that soon afterwards his wife was seized with an\r\nillness which lasted for nearly a year. So that, finding the said De\r\nla Rue near “La Croix Guerin,”[151] he asked him if he could give him\r\nsomething to cure his wife. Then the said De la Rue took an apple,\r\nwhich he broke into six parts, of which he retained one, and gave the\r\nremaining five pieces to the said Blanche to carry back to his wife,\r\nforbidding him at the same time to eat a mouthful. Notwithstanding,\r\nwhen he quitted De la Rue, he ate the said apple, and at that moment\r\nthe said De la Rue appeared before him, he having not yet reached his\r\nown house, and taxed him with having eaten the forbidden apple, and the\r\nsame day his wife was cured. He, Blanche, says that this is a man given\r\nto threats, and is much suspected and generally denounced as being a\r\nwizard, and he has even heard that people have called him “sorcier” to\r\nhis face and he has not resented it.\r\n\r\n[151] EDITOR’S NOTE.--The old name for the cross roads at St. Martin’s,\r\nnear where the village Post Office now stands.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, 1585.\r\n\r\nJehennet des Perques deposed that at divers times the said Collas De\r\nla Rue went to the fishermen and foretold to them when they should\r\nhave fine weather and when they should have storms.… He was commonly\r\nreported to be a wizard. He also deposed that on a certain day, he\r\nbeing at the house of Collas Henry, where the said De la Rue had\r\nquarrelled with the wife of Collas de Bertran, who had called him\r\n“sorcier” (wizard), he threatened her that she should repent, and that\r\nthe said Mrs. de Bertran fell in descending the stairs (cheut aval les\r\ndegrez) and bruised herself from head to foot.\r\n\r\nSeveral witnesses depose that Collas De la Rue is a man much given\r\nto threats, that various persons have fallen ill after having been\r\nthreatened by him, and that he cured them at his will.\r\n\r\nHe was sent back to prison.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Collas De la Rue was executed, for, in a lawsuit\r\nagainst Denis de Garis for concealing a treasure that he had found in\r\nhis house, it is said that the aforesaid treasure was found on the day\r\nof Collas De la Rue’s execution, that is to say the 25th of March,\r\n1585-6.\r\n\r\n\r\n24TH NOVEMBER, 1602.\r\n\r\nMarie Roland is accused of sorcery.\r\n\r\nJohn Sohier witnesses that the aforesaid Marie, having been with him\r\none day at the house of the Henry’s, together with Joan Henry, whose\r\nchild lay ill, she confessed to having bewitched the child, and on\r\nbeing asked in what manner, said that she had put its clothes one night\r\nby the stream (auprès du douit) and that she and her master the Devil\r\nthen entered into the house of the said Henry by the chimney, and found\r\nthe said child by the hearth, and with a splinter she pricked the\r\nchild, and it was bewitched for three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n10TH APRIL, 1613.\r\n\r\nAn inquest on the suspicions of witchcraft against Olivier Omont,\r\nCecile Vaultier, his wife, and Guillemine Omont, their daughter.\r\n\r\nJacques Bailleul deposed that having refused alms to Olivier Omont\r\nhis son was taken with a pain in his ear which lasted twenty-four\r\nhours, that the doctor said that he could not understand it (qu’il n’y\r\nconnaissait rien), that he believes that Olivier is a wizard.\r\n\r\nGuillemine Le Pastourell affirms that Omont came begging from her, and\r\nshe said that he was stronger than her and that he could gain his bread\r\nif necessary without begging, that the next day she was taken ill, that\r\nshe remained ill for three weeks, that Omont, having come again, gave\r\nher some bread, and after that she recovered. During her illness all\r\nher cattle died. She believed it was from some spell cast by the said\r\nOmont.\r\n\r\nMarie Sohier witnesses that the day after the death of her husband\r\nOlivier Omont came to her house demanding bread. She replied that\r\nhaving numerous children to feed she could not spare him any, that\r\nhe went away grumbling. At that very moment her daughter Marguerite,\r\naged six years, was taken ill, and when they gave her some bread she\r\nthrew it away and ate cinders by the handful. That her daughter Marie,\r\none year old, was taken ill one hour after the departure of Omont,\r\nand she had remained ill for two years. That having met Omont at the\r\nMont Durand she threatened to throw a stone at him, and called him\r\n“sorcier,” that on returning home she gave a lump of white bread to her\r\nchild, who ate it all, and since then is quite well. She believes that\r\nthe said Omont was the cause of the sickness of her children.\r\n\r\nPhilippin Le Goubey witnesses that Olivier Omont having begged for\r\ncider from his wife, she refused him, and was instantly afflicted with\r\ngrievous pains; that he entreated the said Omont several times to come\r\ninto his house to see his wife, but that he always refused; that one\r\nday he forced him to enter, and he put one foot in the house and the\r\nother out, and then he fled; that rushing after him he threatened to\r\ndenounce him to justice if he would not cure his wife; that then he\r\nsaid that she would be well again in a fortnight, but that he could not\r\ncure her at that moment; that he forced him to return to the house,\r\nand that, when there, he threatened to keep him there until he was\r\ndelivered up to justice; that at that very moment his wife was cured of\r\nthe worst of her pains; that having shortly afterwards come into the\r\ntown to make a notification of these things, he found that the said\r\nOmont had already taken a boat and fled from the country.\r\n\r\nPierre Simon, of Torteval, being at the Hougue Antan,[152] met\r\nOlivier Omont lying with his face against the ground. He tried to\r\nawake him, shook him, and heard a buzzing (un bourdonnement) but saw\r\nnothing. Feeling rather frightened he left him and went on towards the\r\nButtes[153] of Torteval, and then came back to the place where he had\r\nleft him. Omont suddenly awoke, having his mouth full of mud, and his\r\nface all disfigured (défiguré). Omont having been questioned replied\r\nthat he had fallen from the cliff, and that Pierre Nant had seen him\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nSeveral people witnessed that having refused alms to Omont and to his\r\nwife, their cattle fell ill and died, their cows gave blood instead of\r\nmilk, or gave nothing at all, their sows and their cows miscarried, and\r\nmisfortunes happened to their wives.\r\n\r\n[152] This is a hill at Torteval, on which, says Mr. Métivier, our\r\nancestors used to light signal fires near the “Hougue Hérault,” where\r\nthe northern King _Herolt_ made his signals. He says the name is\r\nderived from the Breton _An Tat_, “the old Father,” a name for the God\r\nof the Gauls; in Swedish it is _Anda_, the spirit, or _Onda_, the evil\r\none. See Notes in _Rimes Guernesiaises_.\r\n\r\n[153] These were the mounds of earth where they practised with the\r\ncross-bow before the introduction of muskets. The “Buttes” still exist\r\nin some parishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n29TH JUNE, 1613.\r\n\r\nThomas Mancell witnessed that his wife having refused alms to Omont,\r\ntheir cow fell ill, and they were obliged to kill it. Jean Hamon, who\r\nflayed the cow, cut it at the shoulder, and “there issued a black beast\r\nas large as a little ‘cabot’ (a small fish). Its throat was such that\r\none could easily insert the tip of one’s little finger, and it had two\r\nlittle wings” (“en sortit une beste noire, grosse comme un petit cabot,\r\ndans la gueule duquell on aurait bien mis le bout du petit doigt et\r\navait deulx petites ailes.”)\r\n\r\nJean Le Feyvre, of the Mielles,[154] witnesseth that one morning he\r\nfound Cécile, wife of Omont, near the Chapelle de l’Epine, where she\r\nwas searching, he could not tell for what, and where she remained for a\r\nlong while without his being able to perceive that she found anything,\r\nand she did not perceive that he was watching her; and he having asked\r\nher shortly afterwards whether it was she that he had observed at such\r\nan hour near the chapel, she denied it, and that afterwards he asked\r\nher again whether it was she who was in that neighbourhood, and she\r\nreplied in the affirmative, and then he started fine rumours, (ung beau\r\nbruit) saying that she was dancing on the thorn which grows in the\r\naforesaid neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[154] _Mielles_, in Normandy, Brittany, and the Channel Islands, means\r\nthe “waste lands on the sea-shore.” In the Vale parish alone there\r\nwere two estates called “Les Mielles.” See Métivier’s _Dictionary_,\r\n_Mielles_.\r\n\r\n\r\n29TH MAY, 1613.\r\n\r\nThomasse, wife of Collas Troussey, deposes that one night, her husband\r\nbeing on guard at the Castle, she was awakened by a frightful noise,\r\nlike cats squalling, and she dared not cry out on account of Olivier\r\nOmont, who was sleeping in the same corridor as herself, though the\r\nmiauling of the cats still continued. When her husband was returned\r\nfrom his patrol, she dared ask Omont if he had not heard the cats, to\r\nwhich he replied Yes, but there was nothing for her to be afraid of,\r\nthat they would do her no harm. That another night, her husband being\r\nalso there, she had heard Omont call “Cats! cats!” and on asking him if\r\nhe had cats in his wallet (en son bisac,) he replied “No,” and that the\r\nnoise seemed beneath where she lay, but that he was afraid that they\r\nwould eat the fish that was on the table.\r\n\r\nOlivier Omont, his wife and daughter, were all banished from the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n30TH JUNE, 1613.\r\n\r\nAn enquiry was held on Laurence L’Eustace, wife of Thomas Le Comte,\r\nsuspected of being a witch.\r\n\r\nJean Hallouvris witnesses that for four years he has driven his cart.\r\nAs the wheels passed close to Laurence she dropped several strings and\r\ntwists of rushes (quelques colliers et nattes de pavie)[155] that she\r\nwas carrying, at which she was very angry. Two days afterwards, one\r\nof his bullocks set off running as if it were mad, and then fell down\r\nstone dead, and the other bullock died the next day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “High Street, 1850.”\r\n\r\nSketched from an Old Picture by the late Mr. A. C. Andros.]\r\n\r\nPierre Machon deposes that he has heard Laurence swear “By God’s ten\r\nfingers” (“Par les dix doigts de Dieu”), and with oaths and blasphemies\r\ncall devils to her assistance.\r\n\r\nChristine, wife of Pierre Jehan, says that her first husband, Collas\r\nHenry, having had a quarrel with Laurence Le Comte, one of their\r\nchildren, aged two years, was taken with an illness which lasted for\r\ntwelve months. When the attack first came on, he jumped high into\r\nthe air, that, before being taken ill he walked very well, but that\r\nafterwards, all that year he crawled on his hands and knees. That,\r\nhaving had a quarrel with the said Laurence, and having put some curds\r\nto cool, (des caillebottes à refroidir), she found them the next day\r\njust like bits of rag (que de la mêque), and that on the following\r\nMonday the child was seized with terror, and cried out that someone was\r\npulling his nose. That, as soon as she went to Laurence’s house, the\r\nchild got better, but, on her return, fell ill again, and finally died.\r\n\r\nLaurence L’Eustache, wife of Thomas Le Comte, was also banished from\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of May, 1617, began the trial of Collette du Mont, widow\r\nof Jean Becquet, Marie, her daughter, wife of Pierre Massy, and Isebel\r\nBecquet, wife of Jean Le Moygne.\r\n\r\nJames Gallienne witnesses that one day, having quarrelled with Jean Le\r\nMoigne, husband of the aforesaid Isebell, the said Le Moigne said to\r\nhim:--\r\n\r\n“You are always seeking to pick quarrels with me, and you say that my\r\nwife is a witch, but before six months are over you will be very glad\r\nto come and implore me to help you;” that immediately his wife fell\r\ninto a lingering illness, and, doubting not but that it was the effect\r\nof a spell, opened all the mattresses and found all kinds of filth and\r\nbits of feather, which he has showed to several people; and in some\r\nquite new pillows which he had at home he found a large quantity of\r\nworms. He says that about six years ago, one of his children being\r\nill, he was putting a pillow under his head, found it hard, and, on\r\nunripping it, found it full of dirt. While they unsewed it they heard a\r\nflapping noise as of the wings of a cock, and the said child declared\r\nthat he saw this cock; that, having shut all the doors, they tried to\r\nfind what it really was, and that, having hunted and ransacked the\r\nhouse, they saw first a rat, then a weasel, which slipped through the\r\nholes of the pavement (sortit par les pertius de la dalle). And at\r\nthe end of two or three days he was asked why he had beaten the said\r\nIsebell Becquet. He replied that he had not touched her, and soon\r\nafter that he was advised to try whether she was a witch, by putting\r\nthe key of his front door (de son grand huis) in the fire, which he\r\ndid. When the said key had been nearly two days in the fire the said\r\nwoman arrived at his house, without asking whether he were at home, and\r\nbegged of him seven to nine (sept à neuf) things which he refused her,\r\nshe wishing at all hazards to come in further (entrer plus outre) to\r\nsee the sick child, which he would not allow.\r\n\r\nItem. Deposeth that his wife having rebuked the said Isebell because\r\nher children annoyed those of the said Gallienne, she went away very\r\nvexed, and the next day one of his oxen broke its neck, his mare\r\nmiscarried, and his wife was taken ill.\r\n\r\nItem; that the children of the said Isebell said one day to the\r\nchildren of the said Gallienne, that if their mother was ill it\r\nwas because she had spoken rudely; that some time afterwards, Mrs.\r\nGallienne being in bed in her room, the door being shut and simply a\r\nsky-light (une luquerne _sic_, lucarne) open, she felt something like a\r\ncat, which, little by little, crept on her chest as she lay on her bed.\r\nHaving shaken it to the ground, she heard one or two growls, on which,\r\nastonished, she began to threaten it that if it was a wizard or a witch\r\nshe would cut it to pieces (que le couperoit en pièces), it returned by\r\nthe said sky-light.\r\n\r\nThomas Sohier said that Jean Jehan having summoned him to come and\r\nmake his will, he complained that the said Isebell was killing him for\r\nhaving refused to make a jacket for her son. That some little time\r\nafterwards James Gallienne, having a sick daughter, caused her bed to\r\nbe unripped, out of which came a sort of animal like a rat (une manière\r\nde bête comme un rat), which hid itself in some wood and was hunted\r\nfor throughout the house; that on the following day, having met the\r\nsaid Isebell, he noticed her face all torn (déchiré _sic_). On asking\r\nher the cause she said it was from “du mal d’Espagne,” (cantharides,\r\nthe Spanish fly used for making blisters); that on that he asked\r\nJames Gallienne if he had not beaten her, who replied in the negative;\r\nthat, being the other day at the house of the said Gallienne, giving\r\nevidence to this, his wife fell down as if dead, and on returning to\r\nconsciousness, said that she was bewitched.\r\n\r\nItem. Testifies that in the bed of the aforesaid daughter (of\r\nGallienne), were found twenty-one or twenty-two spells (sorcerons).[156]\r\n\r\nMany other depositions told the same story. Oxen and calves died, cows\r\nand mares miscarried, sheep fell dead, children and women were taken\r\nill, no cream was found on the milk, curds would not “make,” cows dried\r\nup, or only gave blood. Worms were bred in the beds, or even under\r\nthe women’s caps. They were black at both ends, or sometimes had two\r\nheads. Frogs and black beasts (des bêtes noires) haunted the paths of\r\nthe bewitched persons. Fountains were full of insects, black pimples\r\nappeared all over the bodies of the afflicted persons, and lice, in\r\nsuch abundance that they had to use a broom to sweep them away. On the\r\nwitch being threatened the sick person recovered.\r\n\r\nThe trial was resumed on the 6th June, 1617.\r\n\r\nMarie, wife of James Gallienne … deposed … Item; that for nearly ten\r\nyears her eldest daughter Rachel had been bewitched; that, having\r\nunsewed her mattress, by which was some straw,[157] something was seen\r\nlurking in the said straw, and Jean Le Gallez, being present, said that\r\nit looked to him like a black cat, and sometimes like a cock, and then\r\nlike a mouse, and then like a rat, that it--whatever it was--hid in\r\nsome wood which was in the house, which was immediately rummaged and\r\nmoved, but no one knew how to capture it (ne sçurent tant faire que\r\nde le prendre). That her husband saw it like a cock, and her daughter\r\nlike a mouse; that on opening the mattress they found within it many\r\nspells (force sorcerons) and also beans with which were mingled black\r\ngrains as if mildewed,[158] which beans or grains having been put in\r\na porringer (une écuelle) in the presence of various women who were\r\nthere, it dissolved in their presence, and they did not know what\r\nbecame of it (cela fondit en leur presence et ne sçurent que devint.)\r\nThat the said Isabell, having come to the house at the end of two or\r\nthree days, and asking for seven or nine sorts of things, and trying\r\nto force an entrance into the place where the child was lying ill, all\r\nwhich things were refused her by her husband, so she then went away,\r\nand her face was all cut; and went to her husband and said that she\r\nwould not stay while Isebell Becquet was there, and she believes that\r\nshe is a witch.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, 1617, these three women, Collette Dumont, widow of\r\nJean Becquet, Marie, her daughter, wife of Pierre Massy, and Isebell\r\nBecquet, wife of Jean le Moigne, were convicted by the Royal Court\r\nof Guernsey of having practised the damnable art of sorcery, and of\r\nhaving thereby caused the death of many persons, destroyed and injured\r\nmuch cattle, and done many other evil deeds. They were condemned to be\r\ntied to a stake, strangled, and burnt until their bodies were totally\r\nconsumed; and their ashes to be scattered abroad. The sentence added\r\nthat, previous to execution, they were to be put to the torture[159] in\r\norder to force them to declare the names of their accomplices.\r\n\r\nFirst, the said Collette, immediately after the said sentence had\r\nbeen rendered, and before leaving the Court, freely acknowledged\r\nthat she was a witch, but would not particularise the crimes which\r\nshe had committed; whereupon she was conducted with the others to\r\nthe torture-house, and, being put to the question, confessed that\r\nthe Devil, when she was still young, appeared to her in the form of\r\na cat,[160] in the parish of Torteval, it being yet day, as she was\r\nreturning from tending her cattle; that he prevailed upon her by\r\ninviting her to revenge herself on one of her neighbours with whom\r\nshe was on bad terms in consequence of some injury done to her by his\r\ncattle; that on subsequent occasions, when she had quarrelled with\r\nanyone, he again appeared to her in the same form, and sometimes in\r\nthat of a dog, inducing her to revenge herself against those with\r\nwhom she was displeased, and persuading her to cause the death of men\r\nand beasts; that the Devil having come to invite her to the Sabbath,\r\ncalled her, without its being perceived by others, and gave her a\r\ncertain black ointment,[161] with which, having stripped, she rubbed\r\nher body nearly all over, and, having dressed herself again and gone\r\nout of doors, she was immediately carried through the air with great\r\nvelocity to the place where the Sabbath was held, which was sometimes\r\nnear the Torteval parish churchyard, and sometimes on the sea-shore\r\nnear Rocquaine Castle; that, being arrived there, she met frequently\r\nas many as fifteen or sixteen wizards and witches, with devils, who\r\nwere there in the form of dogs, cats, and hares; that she could not\r\nrecognise the wizards and witches, because they were all blackened\r\nand disfigured, although she heard the Devil evoke them by name, and\r\nremembers among others, the wives Calais and Hardy. She confesses also\r\nthat at the opening of the Sabbath, the Devil, in making the evocation,\r\nbegan sometimes by her name; that her daughter Marie, wife of Massy, at\r\npresent under condemnation for the same crime, is a witch, and that she\r\nhas taken her twice to the Sabbath with her. She does not know where\r\nthe Devil has marked her. She says that at the Sabbath they adored\r\nthe Devil, who stood upon his hind legs … in the form of a dog, that\r\nafterwards they danced back to back, and after having danced they drank\r\nwine, but of what colour she does not know, which the Devil poured out\r\nof a flagon into a silver or pewter goblet; but that the wine did not\r\nseem so good as that which is usually drunk, that they also ate white\r\nbread, which the Devil presented to them, but that she has never seen\r\nany salt[162] at the Sabbath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Castle Cornet, 1660.”]\r\n\r\nShe confesses that the Devil had charged her to call in on her way for\r\nIsebell Le Moigne, when she went to the Sabbath, and that she has done\r\nso several times; that on leaving the Sabbath the Devil invited her to\r\nperpetrate many evils, and that, for this purpose he gave her certain\r\nblack powders, which he ordered her to throw on such persons and beasts\r\nas she pleased; and that with this powder she did much evil, which\r\nshe cannot now call to mind, but she remembers that she threw some\r\nover Mr. Dolbel, the minister of the parish, and by this means was the\r\ncause of his death. With the same powder she bewitched the wife of Jean\r\nManguès, but denies that her death was caused by it. She says that she\r\ntouched the side, and threw some of this powder on the wife,[163] since\r\ndeceased, of Mr. Perchard, who succeeded Mr. Dolbel as minister of the\r\nparish, thereby causing her death and that of her unborn babe. She\r\ncannot say what offence the deceased had given her. She says that on\r\nthe refusal of Collas Tostevin’s wife to give her some milk, she caused\r\nher cow to run dry by throwing some of the powder over it, but that\r\nshe cured the cow afterwards by giving it bran mixed with grass, which\r\nthe Devil had given her, to eat.\r\n\r\nThe confession of her daughter Marie, wife of Pierre Massy, is much\r\nto the same effect, with this exception, that she seems to have been\r\nin the habit of meeting the Devil in the form of a dog, and that he\r\nchanged her into an animal of the same species at the time of their\r\ninterviews.\r\n\r\nThe third of these unfortunate wretches, Isebell, wife of Jean Le\r\nMoigne, enters, in her confession, into some additional details.\r\n\r\nIt was in the semblance of a hare, and in broad daylight, that the\r\nDevil appeared to her for the first time, and incited her to avenge\r\nherself on her sister-in-law, La Girarde, with whom she had quarrelled.\r\nAt first she resisted the tempter, but he appeared to her a second\r\ntime, again in the road next her house, and on this occasion left with\r\nher a packet of black powder, which she kept. A third time the demon\r\nappeared, in the same form, urging her, if she would not give herself\r\nto him, to make him a present of some living animal, whereupon she gave\r\nhim a chicken, and he appointed her to meet him the next day before\r\nsunrise at the Sabbath, promising to send someone to guide her there.\r\nAccordingly old Collette Dumont came that night to her house, and gave\r\nher some black ointment, with which she rubbed herself. She was then\r\ncarried over hedges and ditches to the place of meeting near Rocquaine\r\nCastle. She was received and welcomed by the Devil in the form of a\r\ndog, with long erect horns (avec de grandes cornes dressées en hautt),\r\nand hands like those of a man. He caused her to go down on her knees\r\nand renounce the Almighty in these words: “I deny God the Father,\r\nGod the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.” (“Je renie Dieu le Père, Dieu\r\nle Fils, et Dieu le Saint Esprit”). After this, she was made to adore\r\nthe Devil and invoke him in these terms: “Our great Master, help us!”\r\n(“Nostre grand Maistre, aide nous!”) and also to enter into an express\r\ncovenant to adhere to his service. At the conclusion of this ceremony,\r\nthe same acts of license, dancing and drinking (again bread and wine in\r\nmockery of the Holy Sacrament), took place as are described by Collette\r\nDumont, widow Becquet, in her confession. On this occasion Isebell\r\nLe Moigne entered into a pact with Satan for one month only; but\r\nsubsequently the agreement was extended to three years. She stated that\r\nSatan treated Collette Dumont with marked respect, always evoking her\r\nname first, styling her “Madame, la vieille Becquette,” and giving her\r\na place by his side. She also said that one night, when she was at the\r\nSabbath, the Devil marked her on the thigh. The mark thus made having\r\nbeen examined by women appointed for that purpose, they certified\r\nthat they had thrust pins deep into it, and that Isebell felt no pain\r\ntherefrom, nor did any blood follow when the pins were withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAccording to her account, the Devil appeared occasionally in the form\r\nof a he-goat, and when they took leave of him, they all had to kiss\r\nhim, that he inquired of them when they would return, and exhorted\r\nthem to adhere to him and do all the evil in their power. He then took\r\nthem all by the hand and they departed in different directions. She\r\nasserted also that it was the Devil who had been seen in the forms of\r\na rat and a stoat in the house of James Gallienne, whose child she\r\nhad bewitched; that she was in the neighbourhood of the house at the\r\ntime; and that the Devil, having resumed the form of a man, came to her\r\nand beat her severely about the head and face, which ill-treatment she\r\nattributed to her having refused to go with him to Gallienne’s house.\r\nShe said that she never went to the Sabbath except when her husband was\r\ngone out to sea for the night, fishing.\r\n\r\nThe depositions of the witnesses, taken down very minutely in the three\r\ncases above cited and in many others of a similar nature, have been\r\npreserved, and throw a good deal of light on the popular ideas of the\r\nday in respect to sorcerers and their doings.\r\n\r\n[155] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Pavie used to be grown in ponds arranged for the\r\npurpose, and was used for making pack-saddles, horse-collars, mats,\r\netc. It is a reed.--_From John de Garis, Esq._\r\n\r\n[156] EDITOR’S NOTE.--(See footnote to p. 308). Some had a goat’s hair\r\nintwined, others a flaxen thread.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Linwood Pitts, in his pamphlet on _Witchcraft in the Channel\r\nIslands_, points out, page 6, “that the natural tendency of wool and\r\nfeathers to felt and clog together, has been distorted, by widely\r\ndifferent peoples, into an outward and visible sign that occult and\r\nmalignant influences were at work.”\r\n\r\n[157] EDITOR’S NOTE.--“Il y avoit de _l’etrain_”--a Guernsey-French\r\nword--from the old French _estraîn_, _estraine_, lat. strannu.--See\r\nMétivier’s _Dictionary_ “Etrain.”\r\n\r\n[158] EDITOR’S NOTE.--“Des graines noires comme de la neisle” (an old\r\nFrench word _nêle_, from Latin _Nigella_.)--Métivier’s _Dictionary_\r\n“_Néle_.”\r\n\r\n[159] EDITOR’S NOTE.--The manner in which torture was administered in\r\nGuernsey is thus described by Warburton, herald and antiquary, _temp._\r\nCharles II., in his _Treatise on the History, Laws and Customs of the\r\nIsland of Guernsey_, 1682, page 126.\r\n\r\n“By the law approved (_Terrien_, Lib. XII, Cap. 37), torture is to be\r\nused, though not upon slight presumption, yet where the presumptive\r\nproof is strong, and much more when the proof is positive, and there\r\nwants only the confession of the party accused. Yet this practice\r\nof torturing does not appear to have been used in the Island for\r\nsome ages, except in the case of witches, when it was too frequently\r\napplied, near a century since. The custom then was, when any person was\r\nsupposed guilty of sorcery or witchcraft, they carried them to a place\r\nin the town called _La Tour Beauregard_, and there, tying their hands\r\nbehind them by the two thumbs, drew them to a certain height, with an\r\nengine made for that purpose, by which means sometimes their shoulders\r\nwere turned round, and sometimes their thumbs torn off; but this fancy\r\nof witches has for some years been laid aside.”\r\n\r\n[160] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Mary Osgood, one of the “Salem Witches” tried\r\nin 1692, confessed that “when in a melancholy condition she saw the\r\nappearance of a cat at the end of the house, which cat proved to be the\r\nDevil himself.” See _Demonology and Devil-Lore_, Vol. II., p. 315.\r\n\r\n[161] The Witches’ Sabbath being a travesty of all Christian holy rites\r\nand ceremonies, the “black ointment” evidently represented the chrism.\r\n\r\n[162] EDITOR’S NOTE.--“It is an example of the completeness and\r\nconsistency with which a theory may organise its myth, that the fatal\r\ndemons are generally represented as abhorring salt,--the preserving\r\nagent against decay.… The Devil, as heir of death-demons, appears\r\nin all European folk-lore as a hater of salt.” _Demonology and\r\nDevil-Lore_, by Moncure Conway, Vol. I., p. 288.\r\n\r\n[163] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Susanne de Quetteville, daughter of Jehannet\r\nde Quetteville and his wife Colliche de Sausmarez, was born in 1586,\r\nmarried the Rev. Jean Perchard in 1611, and died in 1612.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIZARDS AND WITCHES.\r\n\r\nThere are some families in Guernsey whose members have the reputation\r\nof being sorcerers from their birth. These individuals require no\r\ninitiation into the diabolic mysteries of the “Sabbat,” Satan claiming\r\nthem as his own from the very cradle. They are, however, furnished\r\nby him with a familiar, generally in the shape of a fly, so that the\r\nphrase “_avoir une mouque_” is well understood as meaning that the\r\nperson of whom it is said is one of the infernal fraternity. Indeed,\r\nin talking of persons who are addicted to magical arts, it is reckoned\r\nhighly imprudent to speak of them as “_sorciers_” or “_sorcières_,” or\r\nto call them by the now almost-forgotten name of “Quéraud.”[164] By\r\nso doing you give offence, and, what is of still more consequence,\r\nyou put it in their power to injure you. It is, however, quite safe to\r\nspeak of them as “_gens du Vendredi_,”[165] or “_gens du hoc_.”[166]\r\n\r\nSatan does not always wait for their death to claim their souls as his\r\nown, but sometimes carries them off bodily; and a former schoolmaster\r\nof the Vale, who, from his eccentricities, had acquired the reputation\r\nof being a wizard, having disappeared mysteriously, and having never\r\nbeen seen again, is commonly believed, to this day, to have been\r\nspirited away.\r\n\r\nThose who are born sorcerers have the faculty of transporting\r\nthemselves at will wherever they please, but those who seek admission\r\ninto the fraternity, and are initiated into the diabolical rites, are\r\nfurnished by their infernal master with a certain ointment with which\r\nthey anoint every part of their bodies before undertaking their aerial\r\njourneys. They are also supposed to be able to introduce themselves at\r\nnight through the chinks and crevices of the buildings into the sheds\r\nin which the cattle are housed, for the purpose of milking the cows,\r\nnot only thus depriving the owner of his property, but also worrying\r\nand alarming the poor animals, whose altered looks in the morning shew\r\nthe ill-treatment to which they have been subjected. An old horse-shoe\r\nnailed on the door or lintel, or a naturally pierced flintstone pebble\r\nattached to the key of the stable door, are both considered efficacious\r\nin warding off these attacks--but an infallible method of driving off\r\nthe witches is to suspend wreaths of the bramble from the rafters.\r\nWitches and wizards travelling, not on land, but through the air,\r\nfinding these unexpected obstacles in their way, get scratched.[167]\r\n\r\nAfter having rubbed themselves over with this ointment they are then\r\ninstructed to pronounce without intermission the words “_Roule, roule,\r\npar dessus ronces et buissons_.” (“Roll, roll, above brambles and\r\nbrakes”).\r\n\r\nThis was discovered in the following manner:--A prying valet, who\r\nlived in the service of a gentleman who was a wizard, of which fact\r\nhe was nevertheless ignorant, was one day amusing himself by peeping\r\nthrough the key-hole of his master’s bed chamber. He observed his\r\nmaster make use of the ointment, and heard distinctly the words which\r\nhe pronounced, immediately after which he became invisible. Wishing\r\nto try the effect of the unguent on his own person, he entered the\r\nroom, and went through the process of anointment, but when he came to\r\npronounce the magic formula, he made use of the word “dessous” instead\r\nof “dessus” (“under” instead of “over.”) Perhaps he was an Englishman,\r\nto whom the French “u” was an insurmountable difficulty. Be this as it\r\nmay, he had reason to repent bitterly of his indiscreet curiosity, for,\r\nno sooner were the words out of his mouth, than he felt himself lifted\r\nup, and carried at a fearful rate through furze brakes and bramble\r\nhedges, while at the same time he had the mortification to see his\r\nmaster gliding along through the air, several feet above the bushes,\r\nand laughing heartily at his misfortunes. At last, dreadfully scratched\r\nand torn, and more dead than alive, he arrived at the spot where the\r\ninfernal troops had their rendezvous, but was too much frightened to\r\nnotice what took place there, only too happy to escape without being\r\nforced, against his will, to enrol himself among them. His curiosity,\r\nhowever, was effectually cured, and he vowed nevermore to pry into his\r\nmaster’s secrets.[168]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Old Harbour.”]\r\n\r\nThe following is another instance of the use of this infernal ointment.\r\nIt is related that a lady of St. Pierre-du-Bois was astonished at\r\nthe long time her husband remained in his private apartment, and\r\nher curiosity at last induced her to watch him. Accordingly she\r\none day concealed herself in the room. Her husband came in shortly\r\nafterwards, and, after stripping off all his clothes, proceeded to\r\nanoint himself from head to foot with a certain ointment, after which\r\nhe repeated the words “_va et vient_” (“go and come”), and immediately\r\ndisappeared. Anxious to know whither he was gone, she went through the\r\nsame ceremony, and no sooner had she repeated the mysterious words\r\nthan she found herself on the summit of Pleinmont, in the midst of a\r\nlarge concourse of people. A table was set out, covered with a variety\r\nof viands of which some present invited her courteously to partake.\r\nPreviously, however, to touching anything, she, like a good Christian,\r\nrepeated aloud the words “_Au nom de Dieu soit, Amen_,” (“In the name\r\nof God, Amen”). No sooner had the sacred name passed her lips than\r\nshe found herself alone. All had disappeared, and the only signs\r\nwhich remained of any living beings having been on the spot besides\r\nherself were recent marks of cloven feet indented on the sward in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n[164] Mr. Métivier derives this word “quéraud,” meaning enchanter,\r\nor “maître sorcier,” from the old French _charay_, _caral_, meaning\r\nmagical type or letter. “In dog Latin _Caraco_ was the writer or\r\nengraver of occult characters, and in the old French version of “Le\r\nRoman du Lancelot du Lac” it says that “Morgain, la seur au Roi Artur,\r\nsceut des enchantements et des _caraulx_ plus que nulle femme.””\r\n\r\n[165] Friday nights being always the nights appointed for the “Sabbat.”\r\n\r\n[166] Mr. Métivier translates this word _Hoc_ as the great feast given\r\nby the enemy of mankind to his familiars, the wizards and witches.\r\nLike most of the words and customs connected with witchcraft it had\r\noriginally a sacred meaning, for he says that the Hebrew word in the\r\nseventh verse of the second Psalm, translated “the decree” is “the\r\nHoc,” and means:--The law imposed by a King on his subjects from which\r\nthere is no appeal.\r\n\r\n[167] From George Allez, Esq.\r\n\r\n[168] From Miss Elizabeth Chepmell.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nA very similar story is told in M. Paul Sebillot’s _Traditions et\r\nSuperstitions de la Haute Bretagne_, Tome I., p. 277.\r\n\r\n“Une femme avait deux enfants, quand elle les avait couchés, elle\r\nsortait, et ils ne la revoyaient que de matin. Un des enfants, qui\r\ncommençait à être grand, fit mine de s’endormir, il vit sa mère aller\r\nsous le lit, se mettre toute nue, et se frotter d’onguent, puis dire,\r\navant de partir:\r\n\r\n“Par sur haies et bûchons (buissons) Faut que je trouve les autres où\r\nqu’ils sont.” Le gars, dès que sa mère fut partir, se frotta aussi avec\r\nl’onguent et dit:--“Par en travers haies et bûchons. Faut que je trouve\r\nles autres où qu’ils sont.” Mais, comme il s’était trompé en répétant\r\nce qu’il avait ouï dire, il passa _à travers_ les ronces et les haies,\r\net arriva tout sanglant au rendezvous des sorciers. Il les trouva qui\r\ndansaient, et qui chantaient, et sa mère était avec eux.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AERIAL JOURNEY.\r\n\r\nThere is a story told of two men who were neighbours and inhabitants\r\nof the parish of St. Saviour’s, that their occupation--that of\r\nquarrymen--took them frequently to the Vale parish, where the finest\r\nqualities of granite are to be procured. The distance they had to\r\ntraverse before arriving at their destination was considerable, and the\r\nroad in some places, rather lonely.\r\n\r\nLeonard Sarre, who was of a companionable nature, thought that the\r\ntediousness of the way would be considerably lessened by having\r\nsomeone to talk to, even if it were only his fellow workman, Matthew\r\nTostevin, whose taciturnity and reserve were proverbial. Often, when\r\nsetting off in the early morning to go to his work, he would, as he\r\npassed Tostevin’s door, look in and offer his company. The answer was\r\ninvariably the same:--\r\n\r\n“Go on, I shall be there as soon as you, though I shall not leave home\r\nfor an hour to come.”\r\n\r\nWhen Sarre arrived at the quarry where they worked he was frequently\r\nastounded at finding Tostevin already there. The way which Sarre took\r\nwas the very shortest and most direct. He was confident that Tostevin\r\ncould not pass without his perceiving him, and any other road would\r\nentail at least half-an-hour’s extra walking to accomplish. There was\r\nevidently a mystery, and Leonard was resolved to fathom it.\r\n\r\nAt last, in answer to his repeated enquiries, Matthew told him that he\r\nwas willing to let him into the secret. He bade him place his foot on\r\none of his, clasp him tightly round the waist, shut his eyes closely,\r\nand, above all, on no account whatever, to utter a word.\r\n\r\nLeonard Sarre did as he was directed, and immediately felt himself\r\nlifted into the air and carried along at a fearful rate. In his fright\r\nhe forgot the injunctions that had been given him, opened his eyes,\r\nand, finding himself far above the earth, cried out in terror “_O, mon\r\nDieu!_” The holy name dissolved the unhallowed spell, at least so far\r\nas poor Leonard was concerned. He fell; fortunately it was into one\r\nof the most boggy spots of La Grand’ Mare, so he escaped with a few\r\nscratches and bruises, a thorough ducking, and a tremendous fright.\r\nWhat became of Matthew Tostevin is not known.\r\n\r\nIt was not until many years had rolled over his head that Leonard Sarre\r\nventured to relate his perilous adventure, and then Tostevin had long\r\nbeen dead.[169]\r\n\r\n[169] From John De Garis, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRYWOMAN AND THE WITCH.\r\n\r\nThe barren and rugged hill of Catiauroc, situated near the sea-shore\r\nin the parish of St. Saviour’s, is the noted and favourite haunt of\r\nwizards and witches. Once every week on the Friday night they resort\r\nthither, and grand assemblies, at which their infernal master presides\r\nin person, are held at other seasons, particularly on St. Thomas’, or\r\nthe longest night, and on the eve of Christmas.\r\n\r\nThough the power of sorcerers in doing harm is very great, yet they\r\nthemselves are subject to all the accidents and infirmities of life,\r\nnor can their supernatural skill extricate them from any difficulty\r\nthey may chance to get into.\r\n\r\nA countrywoman left her cottage one morning at daybreak to look after\r\nher cows. In passing through a furze brake that led to the meadow she\r\nthought she perceived, by the yet imperfect light, what appeared to\r\nher a bundle of clothes thrown on the top of a hedge. On approaching\r\nnearer she was astonished to recognise a lady from the town, whose\r\ndress was so entangled in the brambles that it was impossible for her\r\nto extricate herself, or to descend from her elevated situation, and\r\nwho was so exhausted that she had scarcely sufficient strength left to\r\nbeg for assistance. It immediately occurred to her, that the lady in\r\nher aërial journey to the Catiauroc that night had kept too close to\r\nthe earth, and thus had been caught by the bushes, but, remembering\r\nthat there are some persons with whom it is better to be friends than\r\nenemies, she immediately drew near and assisted the lady to descend, at\r\nthe same time expressing her surprise at seeing her in such a singular\r\nposition, and begging her to walk into her cottage and rest herself.\r\n\r\n“No,” said the lady, thanking her, “I must now make the best of my way\r\nhome. Mention to no living creature what you have seen this day, and\r\nall will go well with you, but bitterly will you repent your folly if\r\nyou disobey this injunction.”\r\n\r\nShe then left the countrywoman. It is not easy for a man to keep a\r\nsecret from his wife, but it is almost impossible for a woman to\r\nconceal anything from her husband.\r\n\r\nThe secret weighed on the poor woman’s heart and rendered her\r\nmiserable, till at last she flattered herself she had discovered an\r\nexpedient by which she might ease her mind without disobeying the\r\ncommands put upon her. She therefore one morning desired her husband to\r\nfollow her into the garden and stand at some little distance from her.\r\nShe then addressed herself to a tree, and related to this inanimate\r\nobject what she had seen, but the secret of course reached, as was\r\nintended, the ears of her husband. The subterfuge availed her nothing;\r\nbefore the close of day she was struck with deafness, and never, to her\r\ndying day, did she recover her hearing.\r\n\r\nThe old woman of the Castel, who related this story to Miss Lane, said\r\nthat the woman was her great-aunt, and remembered having seen her when\r\nvery young.\r\n\r\nStories very similar in their general features to the preceding are far\r\nfrom uncommon in the country, and in all the sorceress is represented\r\nas a lady of rank.\r\n\r\nA countryman met a lady entangled in the brambles on the top of a\r\nhedge. He disengaged her, and was promised that as long as he kept the\r\nsecret he should find every morning, under a stone which she pointed\r\nout to him, a piece of money.[170]\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGIC BOOKS.\r\n\r\n    “O Faustus, lay that damnèd book aside\r\n    And gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy soul,\r\n    And heap God’s heavy wrath upon thy head!\r\n    Read, read the Scriptures:--that is blasphemy.”\r\n\r\n         --_Tragical History of Doctor Faustus_, by Christopher Marlowe.\r\n\r\nMany persons, although not absolutely considered as wizards, are looked\r\nupon with no favourable eye from their supposed possession of books\r\nrelating to the black art, by the study of which they are thought to\r\nbe able to control the elements, to produce strange effects either for\r\ngood or bad on the bodies of man and beast, to discover hidden secrets,\r\ntreasure, etc.\r\n\r\nThese books are generally known by the name of _Albins_, probably\r\nderived from that famous professor of magic, Albertus Magnus, many of\r\nwhose formulas for raising the Devil, etc., they are said to contain.\r\n\r\nThey are also called “_Le Grammaille_” or “_Grand-Mêle_,”[171] and a\r\ndistinction is made between the _Grand-Mêle_ and the _Petit-Mêle_.\r\n\r\nAmong the effects which the possessors of these books are said to be\r\nable to produce is that of causing persons to walk in their sleep, and\r\nto direct their steps towards any point to which the dabbler in magic\r\nmay wish them to go, but in order to accomplish this, it is necessary\r\nthat he should have previously drawn blood from the person on whom\r\nhe intends to practise his unlawful art. So small a quantity however\r\nas that produced by the scratch of a pin is amply sufficient for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThese books are said to be indestructible. If thrown on the fire they\r\nremain unconsumed, if sunk in the sea, or buried in the earth, they\r\nwill be found again the next day in the cupboard or chest from whence\r\nthey were taken.[172]\r\n\r\n[170] From Miss E. Chepmell.\r\n\r\n[171] Mr. Métivier in his dictionary translates _Grand-Mêle_ as\r\n_Grimoire_, or the book by which sorcerers pretend to raise the\r\ndead, being derived from the old Norse word _grîma_, a spectre, a\r\nwitch, a word which is, he says, also the origin of “_grimace_.”\r\nThe _Grand-Mêle_ of the Guernsey folk was literally the _big book_,\r\njust as the _Petit-Mêle_ was the little book, _Mêle_ being nothing\r\nbut a survival of the Gothic _Meli_--a writing, discourse, or song.\r\nAlso _Ma’l_, with the Norsemen, as _Veda_ with the Hindoos, and as\r\n_Scripture_ with us, was simply the collective name of all the holy\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n[172] From Elizabeth Matthieu.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nNowadays the people, in speaking of the “bad books” as they frequently\r\nterm them, call them the “_Grand Albert_” and the “_Petit Albert_,”\r\nthe former being undoubtedly derived from “Albertus Magnus.” The\r\n“Petit Albert” is an abridgment of the larger book, and is supposed to\r\nbe comparatively harmless, and, with proper precautions, some say it\r\nmay even be used by good Christians. The country people to this day\r\nbelieve these books to be imperishable, and many is the tale they tell\r\nof how they will neither drown, nor burn, and how in particular, one\r\nold wizard’s books at Saints’ Bay had to be buried, and part of the\r\nfuneral service read over them, to keep them from reappearing on their\r\naccustomed shelf.\r\n\r\nOur old nurse, Margaret Mauger, has often told me the story of the\r\nbooks belonging to an extremely clever old gentleman who owned an\r\nestate in the country. At his death, when his daughters came to divide\r\nhis large library, they were horrified to find many “witch books” and\r\natheistical books included in it. These they set aside to be burnt,\r\nand also a great many harmless but dull histories, biographies, and\r\nsermons, which they did not wish to keep, and made one huge bonfire.\r\nBut (and it was one of the daughters who vouched for the truth of\r\nthis story) the good books would not burn with the bad books! A\r\nfrightful smell arose, and thick columns of black smoke, but none were\r\nconsumed, and they all had to be re-sorted, and made into two separate\r\npiles,--the sheep and the goats--and then they all burnt readily\r\nenough.--_From Margaret Mauger._\r\n\r\n“In Denmark and some neighbouring countries it is believed that a\r\nstrange and formidable book exists, by means of which you can raise\r\nor lay the Devil--called the _Book of Cyprianus_. The owner of it\r\ncan neither sell, bury or burn it, and if he cannot get rid of it\r\nbefore his death he becomes the prey of the fiend.”--_Demonology and\r\nDevil-Lore_, by Moncure Conway, Vol. 2., p. 282.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRIOR OF LIHOU.\r\n\r\nThe small islet of Lihou lies on the western coast of Guernsey, from\r\nwhich it is separated by an arm of the sea. An ancient causeway, which\r\nis uncovered at half-tide, affords an easy access to the main-land, but\r\nit is dangerous to attempt the passage when the tide is flowing, for\r\nthe coast is so flat that the water rises with great rapidity, and many\r\naccidents have occurred. A church, the ruins of which are still to be\r\nseen, existed here until the Reformation. It was dedicated to Notre\r\nDame de la Roche, and was served by a prior, who was appointed by the\r\nPrior of St. Michel du Valle, a dependency of the great Abbey of Mont\r\nSt. Michel-au-peril-de-la-Mer, in the Bay of Avranches. The isle is\r\nto this day looked upon with such veneration by the Norman and Breton\r\nsailors employed in the coasting trade, that they never pass it without\r\nsaluting, by lowering their topmasts, and there is reason to believe\r\nthat it was a favourite resort of pilgrims. A house belonging to a\r\nfamily of the name of Lenfestey, and situated at Les Adams, is said to\r\nhave been, in former days, the residence of the priest who officiated\r\nat Lihou. A free-stone let into one of the exterior walls has a rough\r\ndelineation of a church incised on it, which is said to represent the\r\nPriory Church of Lihou as it formerly existed.[173]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stone supposed to represent the ancient Priory at\r\nLihou.]\r\n\r\nA few years ago the remains of a skeleton were discovered in sinking\r\na well on the property, to which a certain number of houses in the\r\nneighbourhood have a right of resorting for water. Many persons who\r\nhave gone to draw water at night have heard groans, thrice repeated, as\r\nif from a person expiring, and these have generally been followed by\r\nthe death of some near relation of the hearer. Three days after Mrs.\r\nSavidan heard the groans, a boat, in which were two of her relations\r\nnamed Le Cras, was capsized in a storm and both perished.[174]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the sanctity of the place, however, the old proverb of\r\n“The nearer the church, the farther from God,” might at one time have\r\nbeen applied to it, for it is related of one of the priors that he was\r\naddicted to the black art. Neither the fear of God, nor the censures of\r\nthe church, could wean him from the fascinating study of magic, and the\r\n_Grand-Mêle_ was far oftener in his hands than the Bible or breviary.\r\nBut wizards, it is well known, have often been the victims of their own\r\nart, and so it chanced with the profane Prior of Lihou.\r\n\r\nOne morning, taking advantage of the receding tide, he crossed over to\r\nGuernsey to seek an interview with another adept in necromancy, the\r\npriest of the neighbouring Chapel of Ste. Apolline. He was accompanied\r\nby his servant, to whom he had entrusted a ponderous tome, containing\r\nthe formulas by which he performed his incantations, and to whom he had\r\ngiven strict orders on no account to open the volume or read a word\r\nwhich it contained.\r\n\r\nThe visit over, the prior prepared to return to his convent, and\r\nwalked along leisurely, knowing as it was then spring tide that two\r\nor three hours must elapse before the returning waves could bar the\r\npassage to the islet. The servant lingered behind, and when he arrived\r\non the beach found his master already half way over. His curiosity\r\nhad been vividly excited by the repeated injunctions of his master\r\nthat he should abstain carefully from opening the book. He began to\r\nthink that it must contain something very wonderful, and that, as but\r\nfew minutes must elapse before their arrival at the convent, when the\r\nmysterious volume would, without doubt, be instantly demanded by the\r\nprior, if he did not seize this opportunity of acquainting himself\r\nwith its contents, no other occasion might ever present itself. He\r\nyielded to the temptation, opened the book, and began to read. The\r\nprior by this time had arrived at about the middle of the causeway, and\r\nwas astonished to find the tide rising rapidly and threatening to cut\r\noff his further progress, either backwards or forwards. He felt that\r\nsome unnatural agency was at work, and, guessing how matters stood,\r\nlooked back to the shore which he had just left, and saw his faithless\r\nservant comfortably seated on a heap of dried sea-weed, with the fatal\r\nvolume spread open on his knees. He was reading aloud, and the prior\r\ncaught enough of the words to know that his attendant had hit upon the\r\nspell which causes the tides to rise out of their usual course, and,\r\nmoreover, that he was reading most leisurely.\r\n\r\nIn great fright he called out to the man to read on quickly to the end,\r\nas he knew that then the waves would stop and return to their proper\r\nlimits. The servant was too much absorbed in his reading to pay any\r\nattention to the directions given him, and the waves had by this time\r\nreached above the prior’s waist. In mortal agony he called out for the\r\nsecond time:--\r\n\r\n“If thou canst not read forwards, read backwards!”\r\n\r\nThe roaring waves this time effectually drowned his voice. The servant\r\nread on, but long before he had arrived at the end of the incantation,\r\nthe sea had covered the profane priest, and the demon whom the magic\r\nlines had evoked carried off his prey.[175]\r\n\r\n[173] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Mr. S. Carey Curtis, who is an architect, has\r\nmade some very interesting plans of the ruins of Lihou Priory, and\r\nhas shown their correspondence with the architecture of the building\r\ndepicted on this stone. I will quote his exact words:--\r\n\r\n“There is built into the wall of a house, on the Paysans Road, a\r\nsculptured stone, which corresponds so exactly with what might have\r\nbeen the Chapel of Lihou that I have, on the plan, restored the chapel\r\non those lines. All the principal features work in exactly, the tower,\r\nthe windows, the roof, etc.,--all except the door, of which there is\r\npositively no trace; but possibly, in view of the various coats of\r\npaint on the stone, it is merely a fancy of one of the many artists\r\nwho have retouched it. Of the ruins which remain there is sufficient\r\nto show what its measurements once were. Of the tower, about twelve\r\nfeet is still standing, a large portion of the north wall, and several\r\nsmaller pieces; these all show that it consisted of a nave about\r\nthirty-four by twenty-three feet inside measurement, and a choir or\r\nsanctuary about thirty-four by twenty feet. There is enough of the\r\nnorth wall still standing to shew where the spring of the vaulting\r\nbegan, and thus, approximately, the height of the walls and roof. The\r\ncorner of the chancel arch pier is a Caen stone, with a plain beading\r\non it; there is also trace of a porphyry column on the south side of\r\nthe sanctuary, and under the site of the altar is a paving of Malachite\r\ngreen and buff tiles, some of which still remain; they measure six and\r\na quarter inches square and were laid alternately.”\r\n\r\nThe lettering has been explained as standing for “H … Dominus Lihou\r\nMel,” “H … priest of Lihou Mel, (as Lihou was called in ancient times)\r\nin 1114.”\r\n\r\n[174] From Mrs. Savidan.\r\n\r\n[175] From Dr. Lukis, to whom the story was told by an old woman at\r\nl’Erée.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar story was told me in 1896 by Mrs. Le Patourel, who\r\nhad heard it from her mother-in-law. A schoolmaster, either at St.\r\nPierre-du-Bois or at Torteval, was given to witchcraft, and owned one\r\nof these “bad books.” He took it one day to his school and, by an\r\noversight, left it on his desk. It was a lovely day, and, impatient to\r\nbe out, he omitted to lock it up, and hurried home to get his dinner.\r\nWhilst in the middle of eating it, quite suddenly a terrific storm\r\ncame on, such thunder and lightning as had never before been seen in\r\nthe country, and was most unaccountable in such a hitherto lovely\r\nweather. It seemed to be at its worst just over the school. Terrified,\r\nremembering the book he had left there, he rushed back and there he\r\nfound one of the boys reading this book out loud. He snatched the book\r\nfrom his hand, and asked him to show him where he had begun, and where\r\nhe had read to, and then began at once to read _backwards_ from where\r\nthe boy had left off. As he read, the storm began to lull, and when\r\nhe reached the place where the boy had begun to read, the storm had\r\nstopped as suddenly as it begun. (This is possibly another version of\r\nthe story of “Satan and the Schoolmaster,” related in the chapter on\r\nthe Devil.)\r\n\r\nMrs. Le Patourel also knew a man who had once owned a “_Grand Albert_”\r\nand used it, and, repenting, tried to burn it, but it is well known\r\nthat if you have once used one of these books you can never rid\r\nyourself of it, try as you will. He heated his oven red hot, and put\r\nthe book within it. Two minutes afterwards he looked up and saw the\r\nbook, unsinged even, in its old place on the dresser. My cousin Miss\r\nLe Pelley sends me a story told her by an old servant Judy Ozanne, how\r\nsome very religious people, going into a house found a “_Grand Albert_”\r\non the poûtre (the centre beam) in the kitchen, so they threw it into\r\nthe fire, but in vain, for “it went back to its old place and stayed\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\n\r\nA WIZARD ON THE WEST COAST.\r\n\r\nWe all know how dangerous it is to possess books which treat of the\r\narts of magic and sorcery, or to tamper in any way with these forbidden\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nIt came to the ears of a former rector of St. Pierre-du-Bois or\r\nTorteval, that one of his parishioners, of the name of Sarre, not\r\nonly owned such books, but was in the habit of reading and studying\r\nthem. Indeed, if there was any truth in public rumour, many of Sarre’s\r\nneighbours had been sufferers from the improper use he made of the\r\nknowledge thus unlawfully acquired. The good rector thought it his\r\nduty to remonstrate with his parishioner, and to point out to him\r\nthe sinfulness of his conduct, and the danger he was incurring of\r\nforfeiting both body and soul to the Prince of Darkness; but all his\r\ngood advice was, for a long time, treated with contempt. At last,\r\nwhat the rector’s charitable remonstrances had been unable to effect\r\nwas brought about by Sarre’s own fears. The presence of a large black\r\ncat, which followed him wherever he went, and was with him night and\r\nday, began to alarm him. It was useless to attempt to drive the beast\r\naway; it cared neither for threats nor blows. In short Sarre began to\r\nbe seriously alarmed lest his assiduous study of the forbidden volumes\r\nshould, at last, have brought, if not Satan, at least one of his\r\nfamiliars, to dog his steps continually, and to watch an opportunity of\r\nseizing on his prey.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances he thought it most prudent to get rid of the\r\nbooks, and, with this intent, went one night to the extreme verge of\r\nlow-water mark at spring-tides, dug a hole in the sand, and buried the\r\naccursed volumes. The rising tide soon covered the spot, and Sarre\r\nreturned home with his mind at ease. His feeling of security was not\r\ndestined to be of long duration, for, on entering his door, he was met\r\nby the black cat, who, erecting his tail, and rubbing himself against\r\nhis master’s legs, manifested his joy at seeing him again. The next\r\nobject that his eyes rested on were the books he had just buried,\r\ncarefully placed on their accustomed shelf, and as dry as if they had\r\nnever left it. A profound melancholy seized him; he ceased to occupy\r\nhimself in his usual avocations, and wandered about the cliffs and\r\nsea-shore in a disconsolate state, till, at last, he disappeared. Those\r\nwho were charitably disposed, surmised that, in his despair, he had\r\nthrown himself over one of the lofty precipices of Pleinmont into the\r\nsea, but there were not wanting others who suggested that the master,\r\ninto whose service he had entered, had at last claimed his own, and\r\ncarried him off bodily.[176]\r\n\r\n[176] From Mrs. W. T. Collings, wife of the late Seigneur of Sark.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIZARD’S DEATH.\r\n\r\nA certain man of the name of Robin, who lived near Les Capelles, in\r\nthe parish of St. Sampson’s, had risen from being a day labourer to be\r\nthe possessor of what, in Guernsey, passes for a considerable landed\r\nestate. Riches are sure to create envy, and more particularly is this\r\nthe case when a man has been prosperous in the world and has arrived\r\nat a rank and station to which he was not born. The poor hate him\r\nbecause he has acquired a title to consideration, which his origin, as\r\nhumble as their own, can never confer. The rich pretend to despise him\r\nbecause he is wanting in the accidental circumstance of birth. All\r\nconcur in attributing his success in life to luck, to want of honesty,\r\nto anything but intelligence, industry, and good conduct. It will\r\nnot, therefore, be thought surprising if calumny was busy at work to\r\nblacken the character of one, who, like Robin, had been so fortunate in\r\nhis undertakings. He was openly spoken of by his neighbours as being\r\naddicted to sorcery.\r\n\r\nIt was well known that he possessed the art of taming the most\r\nrefractory bulls, and it therefore followed as a matter of course that\r\nhe had also the power of bewitching other cattle. Sometimes, when a\r\ncow was sick, and all the usual nostrums of the village farrier had\r\nfailed in effecting a cure, recourse was had, as a last resort, to\r\nRobin, who was generally successful. What conclusion was more natural,\r\nthan that he, who could so easily remove a malady, had also the power\r\nof inflicting it? Besides, it was whispered about by some of those\r\nwho contrive to be well informed of all that passes, even in the\r\nmost secret recesses of their neighbours’ houses, that Robin would\r\nsit for hours together, shut up in his private room, with a pack of\r\ncards before him, with which he appeared to be playing some game. No\r\nadversary was seen, but what game can be played by one man alone?\r\nIt was clear to the most obtuse that another was present, although\r\ninvisible to mortal eye, and who could this be but the great enemy of\r\nhuman souls?\r\n\r\nAt last old age came on; Robin became more and more infirm, and was at\r\nlast confined to his bed. During his illness his attendants were much\r\nannoyed by the continual creaking and cracking of an ancient oaken\r\npress, which stood in the corner of the room, and which he would not\r\nallow them on any account to open or meddle with. Of course they all\r\nthought that this chest contained untold gold, for he was known to be\r\nextremely avaricious--in fact he was one of those “who would cut a\r\ndouble[177] in two” as the saying is. He was frightfully hard on all\r\nhis workmen, exacting every moment of their time. So far did he carry\r\nthis, that it is said he only allowed them five minutes to take their\r\nnoon-day meal, which, according to the universal custom at that time,\r\nwas furnished by the employer, and eaten at his table. It was commonly\r\nbelieved that one source of his wealth was the discovery of a buried\r\ntreasure in one of his fields. There was a well on his property which\r\nwas intermittent, at times overflowing, and at others not having above\r\nan inch or so of water in it. It was supposed to conceal a treasure,\r\nand a man was sent down to examine it, but no sooner had he begun to\r\nbale out the water than it returned with such violence that he was\r\nobliged to be drawn up to avoid drowning. When Robin was dying, his son\r\nurged him to give something to the poor, but his constant answer was:--\r\n\r\n“_Je n’en counis pouïnt_.” (“I do not know any.”)\r\n\r\nHis last hour was, however, rapidly approaching, and he desired\r\nthe press to be opened, and certain books which it contained to be\r\nthrown on the hearth where a large fire was blazing. His orders were\r\nobeyed, but, to the great astonishment of the servants and attendants,\r\ninstead of being consumed in the flames, the books extinguished the\r\nfire![178] Fresh faggots were, by the orders of the dying man, heaped\r\non the hearth, and kindled, and, at last, the mysterious books, if not\r\nconsumed, at least disappeared. The press had ceased to creak from the\r\nmoment the books were taken out of it, and shortly afterwards Robin\r\nbreathed his last.\r\n\r\nA storm of unusual violence was raging at the time, but the most\r\nsingular circumstance remains yet to be told. A crow of unusual size\r\nwas seen to hover over the house, and finally alighted on the roof,\r\nand, it is said, that on the day of the funeral, as the corpse was\r\nleaving the house, it flew down and perched on the coffin. In vain did\r\nthe bearers endeavour to drive it off; it held its ground, and even\r\nwhen the body was lowered into the grave it would not quit the station\r\nwhich it had chosen, but suffered itself to be covered with the mould\r\nby the sexton.[179]\r\n\r\n[177] A _double_ is the smallest copper coin in Guernsey currency,\r\nvalue one-eighth of a penny.\r\n\r\n[178] EDITOR’S NOTE.--In _Traditions et Superstitions de la Haute\r\nBretagne_, Tome I., p. 304, M.

All this, whether seen when,\r\nwith a westerly wind, the heavy waves are sweeping in with resistless\r\nforce from the broad Atlantic, or when, on a calm summer’s day, the\r\nsun’s rays “like light dissolved in star-showers” pour down on the\r\nbrilliantly blue water, from which the innumerable jagged peaks arise,\r\nfrom any of which one might expect to “have sight of Proteus rising\r\nfrom the sea, or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.” The shores\r\nare alternately picturesque and rugged, or else smiling valleys of\r\ngreen fields overhung with trees, and with a few old thatched houses in\r\nthe background, and, until lately, were inhabited almost exclusively\r\nby a race of poor hardy fishermen, to whom every passage through the\r\nintricate and rugged rocks of the bay are well known, but who are by no\r\nmeans exempt from the superstitions that seem to attach particularly\r\nto a sea-faring life.\r\n\r\nOf late some extensive quarries have been opened in the hills that lie\r\neastward of the bay, from one of which the dark granite steps leading\r\nto the western entrance of St. Paul’s Cathedral were hewn. The quarries\r\nhave brought other labourers to reside in the neighbourhood, and it\r\nis from a brother of one of these--a Cornishman--that the following\r\nparticulars have been obtained.\r\n\r\nThe quarryman now in question, when he first determined on seeking work\r\nat Caûbo, had much difficulty in finding a cottage to suit him; but,\r\nat last, tempted by the low rent asked for one, which had remained\r\nuntenanted for a long time, he made up his mind to take it. Other\r\nlabourers had lived formerly in the house, but generally, after a short\r\nresidence, they had left it as soon as they could find a decent excuse,\r\nwithout assigning any definite reason. The quarryman had not been\r\nlong settled in his new habitation when he and his family began to be\r\nalarmed by strange and unaccountable noises, particularly at night. He\r\nspoke to some of the neighbours on the subject, and, at last, with some\r\ndifficulty--for it was evident that there was a great unwillingness\r\nto speak on the subject,--he ascertained that the house had the\r\nreputation of being bewitched, and that an old woman living in the\r\nimmediate vicinity was commonly reported to be the cause of the nightly\r\ndisturbances. Some of the previous tenants went so far as to say that\r\non stormy nights, when the wind was blowing a full gale from the\r\nsouth-west, and all were gathered round the hearth, lamenting the sad\r\ncondition of the poor mariners and fishermen out at sea, and praying\r\nfor the safety of the shipping exposed to the pitiless blast, they\r\nhad seen the old sorceress come down the chimney in a cloud of smoke\r\nand soot, pass through their midst, and vanish through the key-hole,\r\ncausing all the doors in the cottage to slam, and leaving a villainous\r\nsmell behind her. Other tales, no less veracious, are told of her.\r\n\r\nA woman, scrupulously clean in her person and attire, against whom\r\nthe witch had a previous grudge, chanced to make use of some not very\r\ncomplimentary expressions in speaking of her, and instantaneously her\r\nclothes were covered with vermin of the most loathsome description. A\r\nneighbour, who had offended her, was never able, either by fair means\r\nor foul, to get his cattle past the witch’s dwelling, but was obliged\r\nto take another and much longer way in leading them to and from their\r\npasturage, to the grievous loss of his time and temper.\r\n\r\nTwo strong horses, harnessed to the empty cart of another man with whom\r\nthe sorceress had lately had a quarrel, though urged by word and whip,\r\nwere unable to move it an inch forward. It was well known to all that\r\nit was by means of books of magic that she was enabled to perform these\r\nand still greater marvels; and her brothers, good respectable men, who\r\nwere aware of her evil deeds and ashamed of the disgrace her conduct\r\nbrought on the family, finding that all their remonstrances were in\r\nvain, and that they could not persuade her to abandon her evil courses,\r\nhad attempted to destroy the books, and so deprive her, in some degree,\r\nof her power of doing mischief.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, during her absence from home, they got possession\r\nof the unhallowed volumes, and, lighting a large fire on the hearth,\r\nplaced them in the midst of the flames, and heaped up fuel around them,\r\nuntil, to all appearance, they were reduced to a heap of ashes.\r\n\r\nThey were rejoicing in the success of their undertaking, but, alas,\r\ntheir joy was of short duration. They soon found that all their labour\r\nhad been in vain, and that they had consumed their fuel to no purpose;\r\nfor, chancing to cast their eyes on the top of an old chest of drawers\r\nwhich stood in one corner of the room, where the books, when not\r\nactually in use, were always to be found, what was their dismay to\r\nsee them lying there uninjured and looking as if they had never been\r\ntouched. Fire, it was clear, had no power over them. So they determined\r\nto try what effect the other elements, earth and water, might have.\r\nIt chanced to be one of the lowest spring-tides in the year, so they\r\ncarried the books down to dead low-water mark, dug a deep hole in the\r\nsand, placed the books in it, and watched until the flowing tide had\r\ncovered the spot with three or four feet of water.\r\n\r\nThey then returned home, and on entering the cottage naturally turned\r\ntheir eyes towards the usual resting-place of the books. There they\r\nwere, without a vestige of sand on them, and as dry as bones. After\r\nthese two attempts they gave up all hopes of ever getting rid of the\r\nunholy tomes; indeed it is well known that there is but one method of\r\ndestroying such books; it is by burying them with their owner when\r\ndeath shall have delivered the world from his or her presence.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that there are men and women who have the gift of\r\ncounteracting the spells of wizards and witches; and it so chances\r\nthat not many doors from the house where the witch of Caûbo dwelt\r\nthere resided an old man whose knowledge enabled him to frustrate her\r\nevil designs, and whose services were readily given to those who may\r\nrequire them. These things are said to have happened as lately as\r\nthe year 1874, and are a proof that, in some quarters at least, and\r\nnotwithstanding the boasted enlightenment of the nineteenth century,\r\nfaith in witchcraft is as rife as ever. Can it, however, be wondered\r\nat, if ignorant peasants should believe in what they think they have\r\nScriptural warrant for considering an article of faith, when learned\r\nmen and educated women are found ready to give in to all the delusions\r\nof spiritualism.\r\n\r\n[180] Caûbo = “Sic Armorici Coet-Bo = La Baie du Bois, Sinus\r\nSylvestris, il y a une Coet Bo sur la côte du Bretagne.” MS. note by\r\nMr. Métivier.\r\n\r\n[181] EDITOR’S NOTE.--It must be remembered that none of Sir Edgar’s\r\nMSS. are dated later than 1874, and therefore that none of the\r\ngreenhouses, suburban villas, and workmen’s cottages which have so\r\nspoilt our island scenery were then built.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WITCH OF THE VILLE-ÈS-PIES.[182]\r\n\r\nThere lived in the last century at La Ville-ès-Pies, in that part of\r\nthe parish of St. Michel-du-Valle known as “Le Clos,” an old lady,\r\nwhose maiden name it is not necessary to recall any more than that\r\nof the really worthy man who had the misfortune to be joined with\r\nher in the bonds of wedlock. Suffice it to say that both belonged\r\nto respectable families. It was notorious, however, to all the\r\nneighbourhood that she was addicted to the execrable practice of\r\nwitchcraft; indeed she made no mystery of it, for she was proud of the\r\nfear she inspired, and clever enough to turn it to her own advantage;\r\nknowing well that the time was past when the suspicion alone of being\r\nan adept in the black art was sufficient to condemn a person to the\r\nstake.\r\n\r\nThe place whither she was said to be in the habit of resorting to meet\r\nher infernal master, and to dance and revel at night with others, who,\r\nlike herself, had entered into a league with the Prince of Darkness,\r\nwas that group of rocks and islets near Herm, known by the name of “Les\r\nHoumets d’Amont.”[183]\r\n\r\nOn these occasions she was in the habit of attiring herself in her very\r\nbest array, and a pair of silver slippers formed a principal part of\r\nher adornment. How she came, in her nocturnal flight, to drop one of\r\nthem, is not known, but it was picked up on one of these rocks by a\r\nfisherman, recognised as her property, and honestly returned to her.\r\nPerhaps the finder did not like to run the risk of appropriating the\r\nprecious metal to his own use.\r\n\r\nIt is said that, not content with serving Satan herself, she laid a\r\nspell on her children as soon as they were presented to her after their\r\nbirth, and so consecrated them for ever to the service of her infernal\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nThe husband, a good pious man, by some means discovered this, and, when\r\nhis wife was on the point of being delivered of her last child, a son,\r\nhe begged the midwife in attendance to be careful, as soon as the child\r\nmade its appearance, and before the unnatural mother could set eyes on\r\nit, to sign it with the holy sign of the cross. This precaution saved\r\nthe infant. The unholy mother’s spell had no power over him, and, as he\r\ngrew up, he was enabled, by God’s grace, and by the pious teaching of\r\nhis father, to withstand all the temptations which were laid in his way\r\nby his brothers and sisters, who depicted to him in glowing terms the\r\namusements they indulged in, when, in the form of hares, they frolicked\r\non moonlight nights around the mill which stands on the hill around the\r\nVille-ès-Pies.[184]\r\n\r\n[182] A MS. note by Mr. Métivier explains this name by saying that this\r\nwas an old residence of Friars, robed in black and white, and hence\r\nknown as “Les Frères Pies,”--the Magpie Friars.\r\n\r\n[183] “_Houmet_, from the Swedish _holm_, is a peninsula, or a grazing\r\nground down near the water.”--_Métivier’s Dictionary._\r\n\r\n[184] From Mr. Thomas Hocart Henry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SICK PRINCESS AND THE WIZARDS.\r\n\r\nIn ancient days, (in what reign is not mentioned), when the island was\r\nas yet but thinly peopled, and considerable tracts of country were\r\ndestitute of habitations, a peasant and his wife, who had been passing\r\nthe day in town, were overtaken on their way home by a violent storm of\r\nwind, rain, and thunder. They pressed forward, hoping to reach their\r\ncottage before night should set in, but, the storm increasing, they\r\nwere fain to seek shelter in an old ruin that stood by the roadside.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they entered, before they heard on all sides of the\r\nbuilding the cries of “Ké-hou-hou,” which are uttered by the sorcerers\r\nwhen on their nocturnal flights. They then remembered that it was\r\nFriday, the day on which the powers of darkness have the most power,\r\nand that all the wizards and witches of the island were reported to\r\nhold their weekly meetings in that place. It was too late to think of\r\nretreating, but they were not yet discovered, and there were still\r\nhopes of their escaping detection. Fear quickened their invention.\r\nLooking round they saw an oven, into which they both crept, and the\r\nwoman, by spreading her black petticoat over the entrance, effectually\r\nconcealed them. They had scarcely time to do this, before a tumultuous\r\ncrowd of wizards entered the building. They conversed with great\r\ndelight on all the mischief they had caused, and appeared to derive\r\nmuch pleasure from the misfortunes which afflicted mankind.\r\n\r\nOne of them mentioned the illness of the King of England’s only\r\ndaughter, which the most eminent of physicians of the realm had been\r\nunable to cure, or even to discover the cause of. “Neither will they,”\r\nsaid one, who appeared to be the chief, with an infernal laugh, “for I\r\nalone know the cause and the remedy.”\r\n\r\nThey pressed him to tell, but for a long time he refused. At last,\r\nwearied out by their entreaties, he said--“A hair, which this Princess\r\nhas accidentally swallowed, has twined itself round her heart, and,\r\nunless speedily removed, must cause her death. There is but one means\r\nof cure--a piece of skin of pork with some of the bristles attached to\r\nit, must be well secured by a string. Let the Princess swallow this,\r\nand the hair will become entangled in the bristles, and may thus be\r\ndrawn up.”\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the meeting broke up, without a suspicion that their\r\nconversation had been overheard, and as soon as the day dawned, the\r\ncountryman and his wife returned to town and made known their adventure\r\nto the authorities. A boat immediately set sail for England, with\r\na messenger bound for the King, and the advice of the wizard being\r\nfollowed, the Princess was soon restored to health. A considerable sum\r\nof money was sent over as a present to the man and woman by whose means\r\nthe discovery had been made, with which they were enabled to buy a farm\r\nand stock it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Mill Pond at the Vrangue.”]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which they had acquired their riches soon became known,\r\nand, tempted by the hopes of gain, a man concealed himself in the oven\r\nof the ruined house near the Catioroc one Friday night. He had not long\r\nlain there before the wizards entered, but before a word was uttered\r\nthey made a strict search through the house, and soon discovered the\r\ntrembling man, whom they obliged to take the oaths of allegiance\r\nto their infernal master, to the eternal ruin both of his soul and\r\nbody.[185]\r\n\r\n[185] From Miss E. Chepmell.\r\n\r\nSee an incident somewhat similar in Chambers’ _Popular Rhymes of\r\nScotland_, in the tale of Sir James Ramsay, of Bamff.\r\n\r\nSee also Suzet’s _Veillées Bretonnes, Comte de Cocherard et Turquin_,\r\np. 258, and _Folk-Lore Record_, Vol. III., part 1., p. 40.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--This story is also told in _Folk-Lore of Guernsey and\r\nSark_, by Louisa Lane-Clarke (2nd Edition, 1890, p. 24). She makes\r\ncertain alterations in the narrative and her version of the cure for\r\nthe Princess is:--“If they cut a small square of bacon from just _over\r\nthe heart_, tied it to a silken thread, and made the Princess swallow\r\nit, then jerked it up again, the hair would stick to it, and come away\r\nfrom _her heart_, and she would recover.”\r\n\r\nOn the 16th May, 1900, the late Mrs. Murray-Aynsley read a paper on\r\n“Guernsey Folk-Lore,” to the Folk-Lore Society of England, and she also\r\nquoted this story, evidently taken from Mrs. Lane-Clarke’s version,\r\nonly told in slightly different words.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WITCH IN DISGUISE.\r\n\r\nSorcerers have the power of taking the forms of different animals, but\r\nwhen thus disguised cannot be wounded but by silver.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Le Marchant, “des grent mesons,” had often fired at a white\r\nrabbit which frequented his warren, but without success. One day,\r\nhowever, beginning to suspect how the case really stood, he detached\r\nhis silver sleeve button from his wrist-band, loaded his gun with it,\r\ntook a steady aim, and fired.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit immediately disappeared behind the hedge. He ran up, and,\r\nhearing some person groaning as if in great pain on the other side,\r\nlooked over and recognised a neighbour of his, a lady of the Vale, who\r\nwas lying with her leg broken and bleeding profusely from a fresh wound.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLAS ROUSSÉ.[186]\r\n\r\n_Une histouaire du bouan vier temps._\r\n\r\nUn bouan houme et sa femme avaient autefais une p’tite ferme ès\r\nenvirons du Vazon; Collas Roussé et sa femme, Nency Guille, étaient des\r\ngens tranquilles, qui faisaient d’ leux mûx pour elvaïr leu famille,\r\nmais i’ l’taient r’ nomaï pour changier leux forme à volontaï.\r\n\r\nUne belle séraïe d’étaï nou vit un biau lièvre dans l’ gardin du\r\nProbytère qui dansait autouar d’une vaque qu’ était la fiquie.\r\n\r\nLa vaque se mins a r’ gardaïr le lièvre qui toute suite se bûti su ses\r\ndœux pattes de derriere faisant des pernagues coum si voulait invitaïr\r\nla vaque à dansaïr d’auve li. Les gens n’ savaient pas qui en craire ou\r\nqu’est que vela qui voulait dire. Ls’ uns disaient que ch’était Collas\r\nRoussé ou sa femme, d’autres pensaient q’nou f’rait mûx de l’ tiraï,\r\nd’autres enfin disaient que l’lait d’là vaque s’rait gataï et q’la\r\nvaque jamais n’vaudrait sa tuache.\r\n\r\nLe lecteur, Pierre Simon, qui s’trouvait la par écanche, s’en fut tout\r\ndoucement pres du lièvre, l’attrapi et s’mis à l’frottaï à r’brousse\r\npel, les uns li criaient d’li teurtre le cô, l’ s’autres d’li rompre\r\nles gambes, “et pis nou verrait bien vite si chen ’tait pouint Collas\r\nRoussé ou sa femme.” L’s ’uns disaient qu’ils avaient vœu le lièvre\r\nv’nir dret du Vazon, mais qu’il avait ieux la malice, de prendre un\r\nch’min detournaï, d’autres vaisins étaient d’avis de prendre le prumier\r\nlait d’la vaque et de l’ mettre à bouidre su une bouane fouaie d’vrec\r\net q’nou verrait bientot Collas Roussé et sa vieille v’nir d’mandaï\r\nune goutte de lait bouailli; c’h’tait là la vraie manière d’les\r\ndecouvrir. Pierre Simon fut bien bllamaï de toute la contraie pour\r\navé laissi la bête écappaï, mais i disait pour raison qu’les lièvres\r\nétaient sujets à des maux d’ têtes coum d’autres personnes et que\r\nch’tait pour chunna qu’il l’avait frottaï. Il aïmait la soupe de lièvre\r\ncoum d’autres, mais que ch’nérait pas étaï bien d’sa part de prendre\r\navantage d’la paure bête.\r\n\r\nLe bouan vier Mêssier en pâlant d’ l’affaire disait: “Je n’ voudrais\r\npas dire du mà’ d’ personne, seit keriature ou cheva’, mais j’ai mes\r\npensaïes au sujet de Collas Roussé et sa femme, l’annaie passaie coum\r\nj’allais r’muaïr nos bêtes de bouan matin qu’est que j’vis sinon daeux\r\nbiaux lièvres a rôguer ma raie-grasse. J’fis du bruit, et i s’en furent\r\ncouarant d’vier le Vazon, et un matin j’mécryi “Tu devrais en aver\r\nhonte Collas.”\r\n\r\nEh bien, chu jour là is’en furent derriere le prinseux, trav’sirent le\r\nbelle, et, j’n’ments pouint, j’ cré qui passirent par d’sous l’us. Mais\r\nterjous, que j’aie tort ou raison, ni Collas ni sa femme n’out peux me\r\nr’gardaïr en fache d’pis chu jour-là.\r\n\r\nJamais n’ou ne me fra craire que g’nia point bien de qué que nous\r\nn’serait expliquer. J’en ai ouï d’bien des sortes d’pis m’en jâne\r\ntemps. Jai souvent ouï la raeue du prinseux tournaï a mignet que\r\ng’niavait fils d’âme par dehors; j’ai vaeux not’ cat aquand i’ ventait\r\ngros assis l’ dos tournaï au faeu, guettant l’us et la f’nêtre coum si\r\ns’attendait à véer quiq’un entraïr, et parfais i poussait de drôles\r\nde cris, j’vous en reponds, et not t’chen s’mauchaï derriere ma caire\r\nquand j’disais mes perières, parfais i’ braq’tait dans s’en dormir\r\ncoum s’il’ tait a s’battre d’auve d’autres t’chens; o’ch’est m’n avis\r\nque des câts et des t’chens vés l’s affaires d’une autre manière que\r\nnous, et j’cré que ch’est grand piti que tous cheux qui s’dementent de\r\nchangier de forme n’aient affaire à yeux.”\r\n\r\nUN LURON.\r\n\r\n_A story of the good old times._\r\n\r\nAn honest man and his wife had formerly a little farm in the\r\nneighbourhood of Vazon; Collas Roussel and his wife, Nancy Guille, were\r\nquiet people, who did their best to bring up their family properly, but\r\nthey were noted for being able to change their forms at will.\r\n\r\nOne fine summer’s evening people saw a fine hare in the rectory garden,\r\nwhich was dancing round a cow which was tethered there.\r\n\r\nThe cow began to look at the hare, who at once rose up on his hind\r\nlegs, gambolling as if he wished to invite the cow to dance with him.\r\nThe people did not know what to think or what it could all mean. Some\r\nsaid that it was either Collas Roussel or his wife, others thought\r\nit would be better to fire at it, and the others finally said that\r\nthe cow’s milk would be spoilt and that she would never be worth\r\nslaughtering.\r\n\r\nThe clerk, Pierre Simon, who was there by chance, crept quietly near\r\nthe hare, caught it, and began to rub up its fur the wrong way. Some\r\ncried out to him to wring its neck, others to break its legs, “and then\r\nwe will see very quickly whether it is Collas Roussel or his wife or\r\nno.” Some said that they had seen the hare come straight from Vazon,\r\nbut that it had had the artfulness to take a circuitous route. Other\r\nneighbours advised that the first milk the cow should give after this\r\nshould be taken, and put to boil on a good vraic fire, and that one\r\nwould soon see Collas Roussel and his old woman come and ask for a\r\ncup of boiled milk. That was the best way of finding them out. Pierre\r\nSimon was much blamed by all the country side for having allowed the\r\nbeast to escape, but he said, as an excuse, that hares were subject\r\nto headaches as much as other people and it was for that that he had\r\nrubbed it. He liked hare soup as well as anyone, but that it would not\r\nhave been right of him to take advantage of the poor beast.\r\n\r\nThe good old herdsman in talking over the affair said: “I would not\r\nspeak ill of anyone, be it creature, man, or horse, but I have my own\r\nideas on the subject of Collas Roussel and his wife. Last year as I was\r\nmoving our cattle early in the morning, what should I see but two fine\r\nhares nibbling my rye grass. I made a noise, and they ran off towards\r\nVazon, and one morning I cried out “You should be ashamed of yourself,\r\nCollas.”\r\n\r\nWell, on that day they went behind the cider press, crossed the\r\ncourt-yard, and, I am not lying, I believe that they passed under the\r\ndoor. But ever since, whether I am wrong or right, neither Collas or\r\nhis wife, have been able to look me in the face.\r\n\r\nNever will you make me believe that there are not many things that are\r\nnot explained to us. I have heard of all sorts since my young days.\r\nI have often heard the wheel of the cider press turn at midnight,\r\nwhen there was not a soul about. I have seen our cat when it blew\r\nhard, sitting with his back turned to the fire, watching the door and\r\nthe window as if it expected to see some one enter, and sometimes it\r\nuttered curious cries, I assure you, and our dog would hide himself\r\nbehind my chair when I said my prayers. Sometimes he barked in his\r\nsleep, as if he were fighting with other dogs. Oh, it is my opinion\r\nthat cats and dogs see things in a different way to what we do, and I\r\nthink it is a great pity that all those who deny that people can change\r\ntheir forms, cannot refer to them.”\r\n\r\nA TRIFLER.\r\n\r\n[186] The above Guernsey story of animal transformations I found cut\r\nout and placed with Sir Edgar MacCulloch’s MSS. in its Guernsey-French\r\nform. I think it better to give both the Guernsey-French and its\r\nEnglish translation, the former being the language in which all these\r\nold stories are handed down to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILLER AND THE DUCK.\r\n\r\nA miller, one day passing by his mill-pond at the Vrangue, was\r\nattracted by the noise and struggles of a very beautiful duck. He\r\nsoon perceived that something was wrong, and that, unless the bird\r\nwas speedily relieved, it must perish. He accordingly, with some\r\ndifficulty, succeeded in extricating the duck from the water, and took\r\nit into the mill, where, after wiping it dry, and endeavouring to\r\narrange its ruffled feathers, he deposited it in a place of safety and\r\nleft it. Returning shortly afterwards, he was astonished to find its\r\nplace supplied by a very beautiful and richly-dressed lady, who thanked\r\nhim for his humanity, and assured him, but for his assistance, she must\r\ninevitably have been drowned, promising him at the same time, that as\r\nlong as he kept the adventure secret, he should, whenever he was in\r\nwant, find a sum of money deposited on his mill stone.[187]\r\n\r\n[187] From Miss E. Chepmell.\r\n\r\nThe transformation of princesses into ducks by magical arts is a very\r\ncommon incident in the fairy tales of Norway and Sweden and Denmark.\r\nSee Thorpe’s _Yule-tide Stories_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHY DE LA CATTE.\r\n\r\nAn old sea captain, of the name of Mahy, who for many years had\r\nnavigated a cutter between Guernsey and England, had, at last, by\r\nindustry and perseverance, amassed a sufficient competency to enable\r\nhim to give up his arduous and dangerous profession, and pass the\r\nremainder of his days in peace on shore. At least, so he hoped, but,\r\nalas! the expectation of happiness, which poor mortals indulge in,\r\nis often doomed to be disappointed, and often by apparently trivial\r\ncauses. Who could have guessed that a cat would have embittered the\r\nremaining days of the old sailor? Yet so it was. The mischievous\r\ntricks of this imp of Satan rendered his life almost unbearable; not a\r\nmoment’s rest could he enjoy in his own house. In vain did he attempt\r\nto drive the troublesome brute away. If ejected by the door, she\r\nreturned immediately by the window, or down the chimney. It was useless\r\nto attempt to catch her; she never slept, and her activity was so great\r\nthat she escaped every blow aimed at her. One day, as he was sitting by\r\nhis fireside, the tricks of the cat became unsupportable; if he dozed\r\noff for a moment, his wig was twitched off his head; if he laid down\r\nhis pipe, puss was watching her opportunity to give a sly pat and knock\r\nit off the table; the moment his glass of grog left his hand, it was\r\nsure to be upset. At last his patience being quite exhausted, he seized\r\nthe poker and gave chase, but with as little effect as ever. Puss\r\ncontrived to elude him, and managed so well that blows, aimed at her,\r\nfell on the furniture and crockery. After leading him several times\r\nround the room, she escaped into the passage, and seated herself on the\r\n“hecq” or half door, which was formerly to be found in almost every\r\nhouse. Mahy seized a gun that was lying on the bacon-rack, and aimed at\r\nthe cat, exclaiming at the same time, “Now I have you!” The cat paused,\r\nturned round, and, in a voice which domestic jars and curtain lectures\r\nmade by far too familiar to him, said, very quietly and distinctly,\r\n“Pas _acouâre_.” (“Not yet.”)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Old Mill House at La Vrangue, at the beginning of the\r\nNineteenth Century.”]\r\n\r\nHe then, for the first time, remembered that he had never seen puss and\r\nhis wife at one and the same moment, and the unpleasant truth flashed\r\nacross his mind that his good woman was one of those who frequent the\r\nweekly entertainments given by his Satanic Majesty on Friday nights at\r\nCatioroc, Pleinmont, le Cimetière de Torteval, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, Mrs. Mahy’s identity was revealed in another manner.\r\nIt is well known to housekeepers who retain the good old custom of\r\nhaving their linen washed and ironed at home, that an amount of\r\ngossip, scarcely to be credited, goes on on these occasions. The women\r\nemployed, moving as they do from house to house, pick up all the news\r\nthat has arisen during the week, and, meeting every day with fresh\r\ncompanions, retail what they have heard, and gather new information\r\nin return, from every direction. Of course the characters of the\r\nneighbours, and even of their employers, are not spared, and for\r\nthis latter reason, perhaps, it is that a certain degree of mystery\r\nfrequently pervades these conversations, and that listeners and\r\neavesdroppers are discouraged. A sort of freemasonry prevails, and it\r\nis only by a rare accident that the scandal and gossip retailed at the\r\nwashing tub or ironing board find their way to the parlour. Great,\r\ntherefore, was the astonishment of the discreet and prudent workwomen,\r\nwhose avocations took them to the houses in the neighbourhood of Madame\r\nMahy’s dwelling, to find that their most confidential communications\r\nwere repeated, and could in most cases be traced to that good lady.\r\nThey had never detected her listening; they felt convinced that none\r\namong them could be so treacherous as to betray their secrets. They\r\ndetermined to keep a sharp look-out, and at last the mystery was\r\nsolved. A young ironer, of more keen observation than her companions,\r\nhad remarked that, in whatever house they worked, the same old tabby\r\ncat was to be seen seated before the fire, and apparently dreaming away\r\nher existence. Her suspicions were aroused. She watched puss closely,\r\nand was convinced at last that, even when apparently dozing, pussy was\r\nlistening attentively to what was going on. She was not long in forming\r\na plan to prove whether her conjectures were correct. She took up a\r\nflat iron from the hearth, and, under the pretence of cleaning and\r\ncooling it on the mat, approached the unsuspecting cat and suddenly\r\napplied it to her nose. Puss jumped up and suddenly disappeared with a\r\nyell, which, as the conclave of gossips declared, resembled far more\r\nthe cry of a woman in pain than the miauling of a cat. Next day it was\r\nrumoured abroad that poor Madame Mahy, while sitting before her fire,\r\nhad been overtaken with sleep, and falling forward had burnt her face\r\nseverely on the bars of the grate! “You know,” said the old woman who\r\nrelated the story, “that Capt. Mahy never passed for a conjuror. He\r\nought however to have had more wit than to tell these stories to his\r\nfriends over a glass of grog, for, although he did not say that he had\r\nrecognised his wife’s voice, or that he did not believe that she had\r\ndozed over the fire, they had already made the remark that Mrs. Mahy\r\nand the cat had never been seen together, and were not long in drawing\r\ntheir conclusions and publishing them to the world. The story soon\r\nfound its way to those hot-beds of gossip, the public bake-houses, and\r\nfrom thence over all the town.”[188]\r\n\r\n[188] From Miss Martineau, to whom the story was related by Mrs.\r\nJonathan Bichard, of L’Ancresse, and also from Rachel Du Port.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE. TWO WITCHES AND TWO CATS.\r\n\r\nIn the Vale parish, very many years ago, lived a father and daughter,\r\nNico and Denise Roberts. Denise was an extremely pretty girl, and\r\nPierre Henry, the richest man in the parish, wanted to marry her.\r\nThere were two old maiden ladies who were neighbours of the Roberts’,\r\nand were excessively jealous of all the attention and admiration\r\nDenise received. They both considered that they were still young and\r\nfascinating, and one was considered to have designs on old Roberts, and\r\nthe other on Pierre Henry himself.\r\n\r\nThey both had the reputation of being witches by all the neighbours,\r\nprincipally because they were never seen without two black cats, and\r\nthey even used to go so far as to take these two cats with them, when,\r\nin the evenings, as was their frequent custom, they would take their\r\nknitting and go and sit for hours in the Roberts’ kitchen. Denise\r\nused to implore her father not to encourage “_ces daeux vieilles\r\nsorilles_,”[189] knowing well that they were trying to poison his mind\r\nagainst Pierre Henry, but he paid no attention to his daughter, as they\r\namused him by telling him all the gossip and scandal of the place, and\r\nhe used to sit and let them whisper to him on one side of the hearth,\r\nwhile Pierre and Denise sat on the other; but all the time the two\r\nlatter were talking, they were annoyed by the cats brought in by old\r\nMargot and Olympe Le Moine, and this went on evening after evening.\r\nIf Pierre tried to move his chair nearer to hers, one of the cats\r\nwould climb up and manage to thrust its claws in his leg. If he bent\r\nforward to whisper to her, the other cat would jump on her shoulder,\r\nand prevent Denise from attending to what he was saying. After some\r\ntime he grew convinced that all this could not be accidental, so, one\r\nevening, just as the largest of the two cats had perched itself on\r\nDenise’s shoulder at the most inopportune moment, he whispered in its\r\near “_Margot, tu quérrâs_” (“Margot, you will tumble down.”) At that\r\nmoment, Margot Le Moine, who was sitting at the other end of the room,\r\nfell off her chair in a dead faint, and the cat gave a yell and darted\r\nup the chimney. This finally convinced old Roberts as to the true\r\ncharacter of his friends, and he swore that never again should these\r\ntwo “_quéraudes_” darken his doors, and, soon after, Denise Roberts and\r\nPierre Henry were married.[190]\r\n\r\n[189] Métivier translates _sorille_ as a term of reproach, derived\r\nprobably from the Bas-Breton _sorelh_, wizard, _sorelhés_, witch.\r\n\r\n[190] From Mrs. Charles Marquand, who had heard it from Denise Roberts’\r\nfirst cousin.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSFORMED WIZARD.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the greatest characteristics of wizards and witches that\r\nthey have the power of assuming any form they please.\r\n\r\nA man, who kept a large number of cows, observed that they were\r\ngradually pining away, that they failed to give the usual quantity of\r\nmilk, and that no care that he could bestow on them availed aught in\r\nimproving their condition. One or two of them had already died, and he\r\nfeared that all the others would soon follow their example. The summer\r\nhad set in, and at that season the cows are left out all night in the\r\nfield, but when in the early morning the farmer went to look after\r\nthem, he generally found them thoroughly exhausted, and looking as if\r\nthey had been hard driven all night.\r\n\r\nAt last he began to suspect that the poor animals were under the\r\ninfluence of some spell, and he determined to watch, in order to\r\ndiscover, if possible, what means were used to bring the cows into\r\nthe condition in which he found them. It seems rather a singular\r\ncircumstance that wizards and witches, with all their cleverness, do\r\nnot appear to be able at times to see things which are passing under\r\ntheir very eyes. Perhaps their eagerness to do mischief blinds them to\r\nthe danger of discovery. At all events, the farmer, who had concealed\r\nhimself, as soon as the daylight had well departed, in a cattle shed\r\nthat stood in one corner of the field, remained undisturbed, with his\r\neyes intently fixed on the cows, who were lying down, quietly chewing\r\nthe cud.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight his attention was attracted by a large black dog, which\r\njumped over the hedge separating his field from that of a neighbour\r\nwith whom he had lately had a quarrel. The dog approached the cows,\r\nstood up on his hind legs, and began to dance before them, cutting such\r\ncapers and somersaults as the farmer had never seen before. No sooner\r\nhad the cows seen the dog than they also stood upright, and imitated\r\nall his movements. The farmer crept stealthily out of the field, went\r\nhome, loaded his gun with a silver coin, which he cut into slugs,--for\r\nit is a well known fact that no baser metal than silver will wound a\r\nsorcerer,--returned to the field, where he found the dance still going\r\non as fast and furious as ever, and fired at the dog, which ran off\r\nhowling, and limping on three legs.\r\n\r\nThe next day his neighbour was seen with his arm in a sling, and it was\r\ngiven out that, in returning from the town the previous evening, he had\r\nfallen accidentally over a heap of stones, and so broken it. The farmer\r\nhad his own ideas, but wisely kept them to himself. His neighbour\r\nhad had a lesson; he found that he had to deal with a resolute man;\r\nthe cows were allowed to remain unmolested, and soon recovered their\r\npristine health and strength. This is said to have occurred in\r\nJersey.[191]\r\n\r\n[191] From Reuben Wilkins.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA DAME AU VOILE.\r\n\r\nSome years have now elapsed since a family had reason to suppose that\r\nrecourse had been had to magic arts in order to injure them. Their\r\nhealth declined, their cattle fell sick and died, their crops failed,\r\nand everything went wrong with them. It was but too plain that they\r\nwere bewitched, and no chance remained of any amelioration of their\r\ncondition unless they could discover the author of their misfortunes.\r\nThey therefore determined, by the advice of a friend skilled in white\r\nwitchcraft, to perform a charm for the purpose of obliging the wizard\r\nor witch to show himself. This charm is popularly called “_Une\r\nbouïture_” or “boiling,” and consists in setting certain ingredients\r\nto seethe in a large cauldron. The pot, duly filled, was accordingly\r\nplaced on the hearth with all the prescribed ceremonial.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did it begin to simmer than six mice entered the room,\r\nwalking in procession, two and two, and all deeply veiled. As soon,\r\nhowever, as the pot boiled, the mice disappeared, and in their place\r\nstood a lady whom they all knew full well.\r\n\r\nHer name we have not been able to discover, our informant being\r\nevidently unwilling to compromise herself by mentioning it, but she was\r\nwell known to the market women by the name of “La Dame au Voile,” and\r\nbold would have been the farmer’s wife who would have refused to let\r\nher have her wares at her own price.\r\n\r\nAnother version of the story says that the mice were caught and carried\r\nto the office of “Le Procureur du Roi,” and that in the presence of\r\nthis legal personage they resumed their own shapes, and appeared as\r\nthree ladies and three women of the lower orders.[192]\r\n\r\n[192] From Miss Martineau, to whom the story was related by an old\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE OF A MAN WHO WAS BEWITCHED.\r\n\r\nA man of the name of Collenette, living in the Castel parish, had sold\r\na lot of furze to another countryman, who was one of the drummers of\r\nthe North Regiment of Militia, but did not receive payment for it at\r\nthe time of striking the bargain. Some days afterwards, Collenette, on\r\nhis way to his work, was met by a neighbour to whom he owed a small sum\r\nof money, who put him in mind of his debt. He excused himself for the\r\ntime, promising to pay as soon as ever he should receive his money for\r\nthe furze he had sold. He then proceeded to his work, which was that of\r\na quarryman, but the very first blow he struck the stone caused him to\r\nstart back in affright, for he distinctly heard a voice proceeding from\r\nthe rock, which said to him:--\r\n\r\n“Thou hast told such an one that I did not pay thee for the furze. Thou\r\nshalt suffer for this to the last day of thy life, but that day is\r\nstill distant.”\r\n\r\nHe looked about to see if any one was concealed near, from whom the\r\nvoice could proceed, but saw no one. He then returned to his work, but\r\nevery minute the same words rang in his ears. At noon he ate his meal,\r\nwhich he had brought to the field with him, and then, as labourers\r\ndo, lay down on the grass to sleep. No sooner had he closed his eyes\r\nthan he was roused by the beating of a great drum close to his ears.\r\nHe started up, but could see nothing, and whenever he lay down the\r\ndrumming re-commenced.\r\n\r\nThis state of things continued, and the poor man, worn out by fatigue\r\nand fright, fell into a lingering illness.\r\n\r\nIf by chance he fell asleep, he was soon awakened by a sensation\r\nwhich he described as being as though a calf passed over his body,\r\nimmediately after which he seemed to be violently lifted from his\r\nbed and thrown on the floor. It is even asserted that articles of\r\nfurniture, which were in the same room with him, were thrown about\r\nwithout any visible agency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Victor Hugo’s “Haunted House” at Pleinmont.]\r\n\r\nHis friends and neighbours kindly visited him, and endeavoured to\r\ndivert his mind from dwelling on his misfortunes, but all to no avail.\r\nWhether in company or alone, he was equally tormented. At last, one\r\nnight, he escaped the vigilance of his friends, and the next morning\r\nwas found on the sea-shore, entangled in the mooring ropes of a fishing\r\nboat, and drowned in two or three inches of water.[193]\r\n\r\n[193] From Rachel Du Port.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEAN FALLA AND THE WITCHES.\r\n\r\nNowhere is the life of a fisherman to be envied. In summer, when the\r\nsea is calm, the days long, and the nights comparatively warm, it may\r\nbe endurable. The amateur may find pleasure in sailing over a sunny\r\nsea, and the excitement of drawing in the lines or nets laden with fish\r\nmay prove a sufficient compensation for many minor hardships; but the\r\nman whose means of subsistence depend on his precarious gains, who must\r\nbrave the perils of the waves at all seasons, at all hours, and in all\r\nweathers, is to be pitied.\r\n\r\nThe coasts of Guernsey abound in fish of all sorts, and the earliest\r\nauthentic records of the island prove that for many centuries the\r\nfisheries have been of great importance, and one of the main sources of\r\nwealth to the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nConsidering the great number of boats kept, the dangerous nature of the\r\ncoast, the numerous rocks, the intricate currents and strong tides, it\r\nis wonderful that so few accidents occur. The fishermen are skilful\r\nnavigators, and have full confidence in themselves; they fear not the\r\nusual dangers of a sailor’s life, but they dread the supernatural\r\ninfluences that may be brought to bear against them.\r\n\r\nThey--or even some member of their family--may have, perhaps quite\r\nunconsciously, offended some old crone who has it in her power to\r\ninjure them in various ways. By her evil arts she may cause their\r\nlines to become inextricably entangled in the sea-weed, or to come up\r\nladen with dog-fish, blue sharks, and such-like worthless fish. Happy\r\nindeed may the poor fisherman consider himself if the old woman’s spite\r\nconfines itself to such trifling annoyances, for has she not also the\r\npower to raise storms? Is it not on record how Collette Salmon, wife of\r\nCollas Du Port, caused the loss of a boat and the death of the whole\r\ncrew, merely because one of them asked her more than she thought was\r\nright for three miserable dog-fish? Is it not well known how, when that\r\nnoted witch, Marie Mouton, was banished from the island for her evil\r\ndoings, the cutter that landed her at Southampton encountered a most\r\nterrific gale on its return? And how the captain and crew were ready\r\nto depose upon oath that during the height of the storm they had seen\r\nMarie, sometimes perched on the top of the mast, and at other times\r\nastride on the jib-boom, tearing the sails to shreds and tatters? Who\r\ncould be incredulous enough to resist such testimony as this? Certainly\r\nnot Jean Falla. He was a bold fisherman. Every rock and shallow from\r\nthe Hanois to the Amfroques were thoroughly well known to him. By night\r\nor day could he steer his way through their most intricate passes. He\r\nwas not aware of having any enemy, but witches are easily provoked to\r\nanger, and unwittingly he may have offended one of the sisterhood.\r\nIf he had done so, he had cause to repent his involuntary fault, and\r\nto his dying day he never forgot the fright he had to undergo in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nHe had left his moorings in the Bay of Les Péqueries early in the\r\nmorning. A more beautiful day had never risen on Guernsey. The sun\r\nshone, a light breeze just ruffled the surface of the sea, the tide\r\nserved, fish were plentiful on the coast, and everything promised an\r\nabundant catch. He sailed out alone, reached the fishing ground, took\r\nhis marks carefully, cast out his lines, and then anchored to await\r\nthe turn of the tide when the fish begin to bite. It was not long\r\nbefore the gentle rocking of the boat and the warmth of the atmosphere\r\nbegan to make him feel drowsy, and, knowing that an hour or two must\r\nstill elapse before he was likely to catch anything, he yielded to the\r\ninfluence, and was soon sound asleep.\r\n\r\nHow long his sleep lasted he was never able to say, but the impression\r\non his mind was that scarce a quarter of an hour had elapsed before\r\nhe was awakened by one of the most terrific storms that he had ever\r\nexperienced. The boat was rolling fearfully, and rapidly filling with\r\nwater. To hoist a sail, to slip the cable, and to turn the boat’s\r\nhead in the direction of the land was his next endeavour, but at this\r\ncritical moment his courage almost failed him. In the howlings of\r\nthe storm he heard a peal of unearthly laughter above his head, and,\r\nlooking up, was horrorstruck at discerning, in the fast flying scud,\r\nthe form of an old woman perfectly well known to him, who appeared\r\nquite at home in her elevated situation. She was accompanied by many\r\nothers who were strangers to him, but she was the leader of the party,\r\nand it was evident that his fright and embarrassment were the cause of\r\ntheir uproarious merriment. Who she was, he could never be prevailed\r\nupon to say, and, no doubt, in this he acted wisely.\r\n\r\nThe wind fortunately favoured him. He made for the land, reached his\r\nmoorings in safety, ran his boat up high and dry on the beach, and\r\nleaped ashore. A fresh peal of laughter from his aërial tormentors\r\nspurred him on.\r\n\r\nHis house was at no great distance from the shore, but the way to it\r\nby the road was circuitous. He took, therefore, a short cut across the\r\nfields, passed over one or two hedges without accident, jumped over\r\nanother and alighted astride on the back of a cow that was quietly\r\nchewing the cud on the other side, regardless of the turmoil of the\r\nelements. The poor beast, roused so suddenly from her repose, started\r\nup and rushed madly across the field, carrying her terrified load with\r\nher. The middle of the field was crossed by one of those deep cuttings\r\nwhich are made for draining the marshy lands of that district, and the\r\ncow, brought suddenly to a stand, precipitated the unfortunate Jean\r\nFalla head over heels into the muddy ditch.\r\n\r\nAgain the unearthly laughter resounded. A less resolute man than Jean\r\nwould have lost all presence of mind, but he remembered that he was\r\nwithin a few perches of his own house. He scrambled out as well as he\r\ncould, reached his cottage door, which was fortunately open, entered,\r\nclosed the door behind him, and fell exhausted on the floor. Another\r\nprolonged peal of laughter dying away in the distance was heard\r\noutside, but Jean, once under his own roof, felt himself safe.\r\n\r\nIt was some time, however, before he recovered from his fright, and,\r\nwhatever his real feelings towards them may have been, he was observed\r\nfrom that time forward to treat all old women with marked deference and\r\nrespect.[194]\r\n\r\n[194] From my father, to whom the main incidents were related by Sieur\r\nJean Falla himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLADEBONE.\r\n\r\nEvery careful and prudent person, before throwing away either the\r\nbladebone of an animal, or an empty egg-shell, makes a hole in it, and\r\nthe reason assigned for this practice is to prevent an improper use\r\nbeing made of either by witches; for it is firmly believed that they\r\nhave the power of employing both the one and the other as vessels to\r\nconvey them across the seas. No matter how tempestuous the weather\r\nmay be, how high the billows may be rolling, the magic bark makes its\r\nway against wind and tide, with more speed and greater certainty than\r\nthe best appointed steamer that was ever launched. Those who avail\r\nthemselves of these means of conveyance seem to possess the power of\r\nmaking their vessel assume the appearance of a handsome well-rigged\r\nship. It is related that in days long past, a respectable inhabitant\r\nof the neighbourhood of La Perelle Bay, went out with the early dawn,\r\nafter a stormy night, to collect the sea-weed which the waves might\r\nhave cast on the shore, or to pick up perchance, some fragments of\r\nwreckage, which are not unfrequently stranded on that dangerous coast\r\nafter a heavy gale from the westward.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised to see, in the yet uncertain light of the morning,\r\na large ship in the offing bearing down upon the land. He watched it\r\nattentively, expecting every moment to see it strike on one of the\r\nmany sunken rocks that render the navigation of our seas so difficult\r\nand perilous. To his astonishment the ship, as it neared the shore,\r\nappeared to diminish rapidly in size. He was alarmed, but curiosity\r\ngot the better of fright, and he stood his ground manfully. The vessel\r\nat last stranded close to the spot where he was standing, and, by this\r\ntime, it was reduced to the dimensions of one of those toy boats, with\r\nwhich the children amuse themselves in the pools left on the beach by\r\nthe receding tide.\r\n\r\nA man of dwarfish stature stepped on shore, and the countryman then\r\nperceived that the mysterious vessel had assumed the form of the\r\nbladebone of a sheep, enveloped in a mass of tangled sea-weed. Nothing\r\ndaunted, he addressed the mysterious stranger, and asked him whence he\r\ncame? What was his name? Whither was he going? The stranger either was,\r\nor pretended to be, ignorant of the language in which he was addressed,\r\nbut to the last question answered: “Je vais cheminant”--(“I am going\r\ntravelling”).\r\n\r\nHe is said, however, to have remained in the island, to have built\r\nhimself a house on a spot called “Casquet,”[195] in the neighbourhood\r\nof the place where he landed, and to have become the progenitor of a\r\nfamily which bears the name of “Le Cheminant,” and of which many of the\r\nmembers were famous for their skill as smiths.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that in this tale we have the remains--strangely\r\naltered by passing through the mouths of many successive\r\ngenerations--of some one of the numerous legendary stories of the\r\nearly British saints, who, according to some of the hagiographers,\r\nwere in the habit of navigating from Brittany to Cornwall, and from\r\nWales to Ireland, on their mantles, in stone troughs, or on bundles of\r\nsea-weed.[196]\r\n\r\n[195] According to Métivier’s _Dictionary_--“Casquet”--(from the Latin\r\n_Casicare_) means “Over-fall Rock,” and is the same as the _Casus\r\nRupes_ of Hearne and Leland.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--The name of the house is “La Perelle,” “Casquet” is\r\na nick-name. After the erection of a lighthouse on “Casquet” or “Les\r\nCasquets,” the fishermen keeping their boats in Perelle Bay, nick-named\r\nthe house “Le P’tit Casquet,” because the inhabitants were in the habit\r\nof sitting up late, and consequently there was light to be seen in the\r\nhouse when they returned from sea late in the evening.--_From John de\r\nGaris, Esq._\r\n\r\n[196] From George Métivier, Esq., and Mrs. Savidan.\r\n\r\nSee in Thorpe’s _Northern Mythology_, Vol. I., p. 179, how Oller\r\ncrosses the sea on a bone.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WITCH’S FORESIGHT.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that those who practise unlawful acts, however\r\nclever they may be, are generally quite unable to foresee what is\r\nlikely to happen to themselves. That this is not invariably the case\r\nthe following story will show.\r\n\r\nA woman, who had the reputation of being a sorceress, contrived to\r\nlive in comparative ease and comfort by begging from door to door,\r\nfew venturing to send her away without an alms for fear of incurring\r\nher displeasure, and bringing down some misfortune on themselves or\r\ntheir households. She presented herself one morning at the house of\r\na farmer in easy circumstances, whose wife was one not likely to be\r\nimposed upon, and not by any means remarkable for liberality towards\r\nthe poor. The witch’s well-contrived tale of distress failed to make\r\nan impression on the hard heart of the farmer’s wife, and the beggar\r\nwas dismissed without even a kind word: indeed, it is even said that\r\nthe odious epithet “_Caïmande_”[197] was applied to her. On turning\r\nher back on the inhospitable door, she was heard to mutter between her\r\nteeth, “You shall repent of this.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Market Place and States Arcade.]\r\n\r\nIt was a fine morning in spring, and a hen that had hatched an early\r\nbrood of chickens, had brought them out into the sun, and was clucking\r\nover her callow brood, and scratching the earth in search of seeds and\r\ninsects for them. The farmer’s wife was looking on with complacency,\r\nand already calculating in her mind what the brood was likely to\r\nfetch in the market. The proverb tells us that we must not reckon our\r\nchickens before they are hatched. It seems that it is not wise to\r\nreckon on them even after they are hatched. And this the farmer’s wife\r\nfound to her cost; for, scarcely was the witch out of the farm-yard,\r\nbefore one of the chickens fell on its side, gave a kick or two, and\r\ndied. Its example was soon followed by all its brothers and sisters,\r\nand, last of all, the bereaved mother also departed this life. The\r\nfarmer’s wife was at no loss to whose evil agency to impute this\r\nuntoward event, and hastened at once to consult an old neighbour, a\r\nwise woman, who had the reputation of knowing how these unholy spells\r\nwere to be counteracted, and what means were to be adopted to prevent\r\nthe sorceress from doing any further mischief. She was advised to\r\nlose no time in returning home; to extract carefully the hearts of all\r\nthe chickens, as well as that of the hen; to stick new pins or nails\r\ninto them, and to roast or fry them over a brisk fire, when, she was\r\nassured, that not only would the witch be made to suffer unheard of\r\nagonies, but that all power would be taken from her to do any further\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\nThe farmer’s wife hastened home to follow the instructions given her\r\nby the wise woman, but found, to her dismay, that the sorceress had\r\nprofited by her short absence from home to re-visit the farmyard and\r\nthat she had carefully removed every heart from the carcases.[198]\r\n\r\n[197] Métivier derives this word--meaning “beggar”--from the old\r\nFrench word “_guermenter_” to complain. The old Bas-Breton word was\r\n“_c’harm_”--to utter cries.\r\n\r\n[198] From Charlotte Du Port.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORTUNE TELLING.\r\n\r\nPersons who have the temerity to wish to pry into the secrets of\r\nfuturity are frequently punished for their curiosity by the exact\r\nfulfilment of the prediction, although it may appear to be such as\r\ncould by no possibility come to pass. The following story may be taken\r\nas an instance.\r\n\r\nA young man applied to a woman, who pretended to be able to foresee\r\nevents, to tell him what was likely to happen to him hereafter. She\r\nforetold that he had not long to live, but that he should be hanged,\r\ndrowned, and burnt. Not knowing how it was possible that all these\r\nevils should come upon him, he made light of the prophecy, but the\r\nevent proved the truth of the soothsayer’s prediction. One night,\r\nhaving allowed his fire to go out, and having no means at hand to\r\nrekindle it, he ran across the fields to the nearest habitation to\r\nbeg a light. On his return, in jumping over a ditch, his foot caught\r\nin some brambles, and he fell head foremost into the water, his legs\r\nat the same time became so entangled in the bushes that he remained\r\nsuspended, and the torch which he held in his hand setting fire to his\r\nclothes, he perished, as the fortune-teller had predicted, by hanging,\r\ndrowning, and burning.[199]\r\n\r\n[199] From Rachel Du Port.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.\r\n\r\nOther Editor’s Notes on this subject will be found in Appendix B.\r\n\r\nCompare “Damasc, Seigneur d’Asnières, excommunié par Hugues de\r\nSaint-Calais, Evêque de Mans (A.D. 1136-1144). Damasc, averti qu’il\r\npérirait par le feu et par l’eau, ne fit qu’en rire; mais un jour,\r\ntraversant en bateau la Sarthe pendant un orage, il fut foudroyé et\r\nnoyé.”--La Suze.--_Magazin Pittoresque_, 34me année, p. 312.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCharms, Spells, and Incantations.\r\n\r\n    “This, gathered in the planetary hour,\r\n    With noxious weeds, and spell’d with words of power,\r\n    Dire stepdames in the magic bowl infuse.”\r\n\r\n                                              --_Dryden._\r\n\r\n    “Begin, begin; the mystic spell prepare.”\r\n\r\n                                  --_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs long as the popular belief in witchcraft exists--and with all the\r\nboasted light and civilisation of the nineteenth century it still\r\nholds its ground--there will be found those who imagine that the evil\r\ninfluence of the sorcerer may be averted by a counteracting spell, or\r\nby certain practices, such as carrying an amulet about one’s person,\r\nnailing a horse-shoe to the door of a house or the mast of a ship, etc.\r\n\r\nWith the ignorant and unlearned it is often useless to reason: they\r\ncannot understand nice distinctions, and if their faith be shaken or\r\ndestroyed on one point, who can tell where the current of unbelief will\r\nstop? That there are persons who, by their illicit arts, can cause\r\nsickness to man or beast is firmly credited, but as there is no evil\r\nwithout a remedy, it is equally an article of popular belief that there\r\nare also those who are in possession of the necessary knowledge and\r\npower to counteract the evil designs and practices of the sorcerer.\r\n\r\nAs may readily be supposed these last are cunning and unprincipled\r\nwretches, who trade on the folly and superstition of their ignorant\r\nneighbours, and who, doubtless, are often the cause of the malady of\r\nthe unfortunate cow or pig, which they are afterwards called in to\r\nadvise about. Various charms and ceremonies are resorted to on these\r\noccasions, whereof the most potent appears to be that known as “_la\r\nbouïture_,” which consists in setting a number of ingredients to\r\nseethe together in a cauldron, of which the principal is the heart of\r\nsome animal stuck full of pins. It is not easy to arrive at a correct\r\nknowledge of what is done, for great secrecy is generally observed, and\r\nthe actors in these superstitious follies are afraid to divulge what\r\ntakes place. The object of the charm seems to be either to avert the\r\nevil, or to discover the author of it. In the latter case, it often\r\nleads to serious misunderstandings between neighbours. There are,\r\nhowever, certain charms of a more innocent character, which can be\r\nresorted to without the intervention of a cunning man.\r\n\r\nShortly after the Rev. Thomas Brock took possession of the Rectory of\r\nSt. Pierre-du-Bois, about the beginning of the nineteenth century, he\r\nwas returning home one night from town, where he had been detained\r\nuntil a late hour. It was midnight when he reached the parsonage, and\r\nin the imperfect light he thought that he saw a number of persons\r\nassembled near the church porch. Astonished at so unusual a sight, and\r\nwondering what could possibly be the cause of such an assembly at that\r\nhour, he tied up his horse to the gate, and stepped over the stile into\r\nthe churchyard. On drawing near he was witness to an extraordinary\r\nceremony. Several of his parishioners, among whom he recognised many\r\nof the better sort, were walking in orderly procession round the\r\nchurch, and touching every angle as they passed. He addressed them and\r\ninquired what they were doing, but not a single word could he get in\r\nanswer to his questions. Perfect silence was preserved until they came\r\nto the church-porch, where they all knelt down and recited the Lord’s\r\nPrayer. This was repeated more than once, and at last they left the\r\nplace without satisfying the legitimate curiosity of their pastor.\r\nDetermined to fathom the mystery, he called the next day on some of the\r\nprincipal actors in the ceremony, and then learnt, not without some\r\ndifficulty, that it was intended to remove a spell that was supposed\r\nto be hanging over the son or daughter of one of the parties, and that\r\na single word spoken by any of the persons engaged in the solemn rite,\r\nwould have effectually broken the charm.\r\n\r\nIn reference to this charm it may here be mentioned that an old\r\nservant of the Rev. W. Chepmell, Rector of St. Sampson’s and the Vale,\r\nwas suffering from an ulcer in the leg. To cure it she went round\r\nthe church, stopping at each of the angles, and repeating a certain\r\nprayer. The Rev. H. Le M. Chepmell, D.D., who was a child at the time,\r\nremembers the circumstance, but does not know what the prayer was that\r\nwas used on the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe forms which follow, and which, for the benefit of those who\r\nare unacquainted with French, have been translated as closely as\r\npossible, were found in a book of memoranda, household and farming\r\naccounts, recipes for medicines, etc., which once belonged to Sieur\r\nJean Lenfestey, des Adams, in the parish of St. Pierre-du-Bois. It\r\nwas written about the end of the last, and beginning of the present,\r\ncentury. The mystical words used in some of the spells have been given\r\njust as they were found in the manuscript. They appear to be a curious\r\njumble of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, very much disfigured by having\r\npassed through the hands of ignorant, unlettered transcribers, or,\r\nperhaps, by having been transmitted orally from one to another, and,\r\nat last, taken down from dictation. It is quite impossible to say how\r\nlong these spells and charms have been in use among the peasantry,\r\nwhether they have been handed down by tradition from times before the\r\nReformation, or whether--which is far more probable--they have been\r\nintroduced in comparatively recent times by some of the farm-labourers,\r\nwho, in times of peace, come to the island from the neighbouring coasts\r\nof Normandy and Brittany in search of work. It is only on the latter\r\nsupposition that the invocation of St. Blaize and St. Nicodemus, the\r\nsaying of a Mass, and the reciting of _Paters_ and _Ave-Marias_ can\r\nbe accounted for, the indigenous population having been so thoroughly\r\nreformed as to have lost all recollection of these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO REMOVE ANY KIND OF SPELL, AND CAUSE THE PERSON WHO HAS CAST IT TO\r\nAPPEAR.\r\n\r\nChoose one of the animals whose death has been caused, taking care that\r\nthere is no sign of life remaining in it: take out its heart, and place\r\nit in a clean plate: then take nine thorns of “noble épine”[200] and\r\nproceed as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The “Groignet.”]\r\n\r\nPierce one of the thorns into the heart, saying:--\r\n\r\n_Adibaga, Sabaoth, Adonay, contra, ratout prisons preront fini unixio\r\nparacle gasum_.\r\n\r\nTake two thorns and pierce them in, saying:--_Qui susum mediotos agres\r\ngravoil valax_.\r\n\r\nTake two more, and in placing them say:--_Laula zazai valoi sator\r\nsaluxu paracle gassum_.\r\n\r\nTake two more, and say in placing them:--_Mortuis cum fice suni et per\r\nflagelationem domini nostri Jesu Christi_.\r\n\r\nThen place the last two thorns with these words:--_Avir sunt devant\r\nnous paracle tui strator verbonum ossisum fidando_.\r\n\r\nThen continue saying:--“I call on him or her who has caused the Missal\r\nAbel to be fabricated: cease from thine evil deed; come, nevertheless,\r\nby sea or by land, wherever thou art; show thyself to us without delay\r\nand without fail.”\r\n\r\n(Note: that if thorns of the “noble épine” are not to be procured, one\r\nmay have recourse to new nails).\r\n\r\nThe heart, being pierced with thorns, as directed, must be put into a\r\nsmall bag and hung in the chimney. The next day it must be taken out\r\nof the bag and put upon a plate; then pull out the first thorn, and\r\nplace it in another part of the heart, pronouncing the same words as\r\nwere said at first; then take out the two next thorns with the fitting\r\nwords, and so on with the others in due order, replacing them as we\r\nhave directed, and being careful never to stick a thorn again into the\r\nsame hole. This is to be done on nine consecutive days; nevertheless,\r\nif you wish not to give any respite to the malefactor, you may compress\r\nthe nine days into one, observing the order above prescribed. At\r\nthe last operation, after having pierced in the thorns or nails with\r\nthe fitting words, you must make a large fire, place the heart on a\r\ngridiron, and put it to roast on the live embers. The malefactor will\r\nbe obliged to appear and to beg for mercy; and if it be out of his\r\npower to appear within the time you appoint, his death will ensue.\r\n\r\n[200] Probably a corruption of “aube-épine.”\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER METHOD.\r\n\r\nKill a pigeon; open it and pluck out its heart. Stick new pins all\r\nround the heart. Put water to boil in a small pot, and when it is\r\nboiling throw the heart in it. You must have ready a green turf\r\nto serve as a cover to the pot, and must put it on with the earth\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\nThe pot must boil for an hour. Be careful to keep up a good fire of\r\nwood or charcoal, and at the end of the hour throw the heart into the\r\nburning embers. See that all the doors, windows, and other openings of\r\nthe house are closed. The sorcerer will come and call and knock at the\r\ndoor, demanding to speak with you; but you must not open to him until\r\nyou have made him promise to do what you wish.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER MEANS OF CAUSING A SORCERER TO SHEW HIMSELF.\r\n\r\nTake the tails of two fresh-water eels, with the inner bark of an ash\r\ntree, that which is next the wood. Buy twenty-six new needles, and put\r\nall to burn together with flower of sulphur.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to see the sorcerer by daylight you must take the roots of\r\nsmall and large sage, with the pith of the elder and daffodil bulbs.\r\nPut the whole to boil together in vinegar, and make your arrangements\r\nso that it shall boil a quarter of an hour before noon. As soon as the\r\nfirst bubbles begin to rise the sorcerer will make his appearance. In\r\nthis experiment you must leave the door open. It is done simply with\r\nthe view of knowing the malefactor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO AVERT ALL SORTS OF SPELLS AND ENCHANTMENTS.\r\n\r\nTake a sheep’s heart, pierce nails into it, and hang it in the chimney,\r\nsaying:--_Rostin, Clasta Auvara, Chasta, Custodia, Duranee_. These\r\nwords must be said over the heart every day, and eight days will not\r\nhave elapsed before the sorcerer who has cast the spell will come and\r\nbeg you to remove the heart, complaining that he feels great pain\r\ninternally. You can then ask him to remove the spell, and he will\r\nrequest you to give him some animal to which he may transfer it. You\r\nmay grant what he asks, otherwise he will burst asunder.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRESERVATIVE AGAINST SPELLS, TO BE HUNG ROUND THE NECK.\r\n\r\nTake nine bits of green broom, and two sprigs of the same, which\r\nyou must tie together in the form of a cross (×); nine morsels of\r\nelder, nine leaves of betony, nine of agrimony, a little bay salt,\r\nsal-ammoniac, new wax, barley, leaven, camphor and quick-silver. The\r\nquick-silver must be inclosed in cobbler’s wax. Put the whole into\r\na new linen cloth which has never been used, and sew it well up so\r\nthat nothing may fall out. Hang this round your neck. It is a sure\r\npreservative against the power of witches.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WIN AT PLAY\r\n\r\nOn St. John’s Eve gather fern before noon. Make a bracelet of it in the\r\nform of these letters--H U T Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAKE PEACE BETWEEN MEN WHO ARE FIGHTING.\r\n\r\nWrite on the circumference of an apple the letters H A O N and throw it\r\ninto the midst of the combatants.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO STOP BLEEDING.\r\n\r\nTouching the part affected, say:--_Place + + + Consummatum + + +\r\nResurrexit_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CURE A BURN.\r\n\r\nRepeat these words thrice over the burn, breathing thereon each time:--\r\n\r\n    _“Feu de Dieu, perds ta chaleur,_\r\n    _Comme Judas perdit sa couleur,_\r\n    _Quand il trahit notre Seigneur,_\r\n    _Au jardin des oliviers.”_[201]\r\n\r\n[201] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Another form is as follows.--\r\n\r\n    Brulure, brulure, mollis ta chaleur,\r\n    Comme Judas perdit sa couleur\r\n    En trahissant notre Seigneur.\r\n\r\n--_From John de Garis, Esq._\r\n\r\n\r\nTO STOP A FIRE THAT IS BURNING A HOUSE.\r\n\r\nMake three crosses on the mantel-piece with a live coal, and say:--“_In\r\nte Domine speravi, non confundar in æternum_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAUSE A PERSON TO LOVE YOU.\r\n\r\nTake four-leaved clover and place it on a consecrated stone; then say\r\na Mass over it, put it into a nosegay, and make the person smell it,\r\nsaying at the same time “_Gabriel illa sunt_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER MEANS.\r\n\r\nOn St. John’s Eve gather clecampane (alliène de campana), dry it in an\r\noven, reduce it to powder with ambergris, and wear it next your heart\r\nfor nine days. Then endeavour to get the person whose love you wish to\r\nobtain, to swallow a portion of it, and the effect is sure to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PREVENT A SPORTSMAN FROM KILLING ANY GAME.\r\n\r\nSay:--“_Si ergo me quæritis, sinite hos abire_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CURE A HORSE THAT HAS THE VIVES OR THE GRIPES.[202]\r\n\r\nSay:--“Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made the Heavens and\r\nthe Earth. In the name of God, Amen! St. Nicodemus, who tookest down\r\nour Lord Jesus Christ from the cross, deign by the permission of God to\r\ncure this horse (name the colour), belonging to (name the owner), of\r\nthe vives or gripes (as the case may be).”\r\n\r\nThen let all who are present say the Lord’s Prayer nine times.\r\n\r\n[202] This charm must have been long current in Guernsey, for the\r\ninvocation with which it commences is a strictly Presbyterian form,\r\nbeing the sentence with which the services of the Reformed French\r\nChurch invariably began.\r\n\r\nThe mention of “_Paters_” and “_Aves_,” and the invocation of St. Eloy\r\nin the second charm, points clearly to a Romish origin, and render it\r\nvery doubtful whether the charm could ever have been resorted to in\r\nGuernsey within the last two or three hundred years. St. Nicodemus\r\nmight still be recognised, but St. Eloy has long been entirely\r\nforgotten, and probably not one in a thousand of our peasantry has the\r\nslightest idea of what is meant by the words “_Pater_” and “_Ave_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER FORM.\r\n\r\n“Horse (name the colour), belonging to (name the owner), if thou hast\r\nthe vives, or the red gripes, or any other of thirty-six maladies, in\r\ncase thou be suffering from them: May God cure thee and the blessed\r\nSaint Eloy! In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy\r\nGhost, Amen!”\r\n\r\nThen say five “_Paters_” and five “_Aves_” on your knees.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO REMOVE A FISH BONE FROM THE THROAT.\r\n\r\nSay:--“Blaise, martyr for Jesus Christ, command thee to come up or go\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PREVENT A DOG FROM BARKING OR BITING.\r\n\r\nSay three times, while looking at the dog:--“Bare--Barbare! May\r\nthy tail hang down! May St. Peter’s key close thy jaws until\r\nto-morrow!”[203]\r\n\r\n[203] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Many of these charms are to be found almost word\r\nfor word in _Croyances et Légendes du Centre de la France_, by Laisnel\r\nde la Salle, Vol. I., p. 291-330., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUICK-SILVER A PROTECTION AGAINST WITCHCRAFT.\r\n\r\nA belief in the efficacy of quick-silver in counteracting the evil eye,\r\nand averting the injurious effects of spells, is very universal among\r\nthe lower orders; and there are many persons who will never venture\r\nbeyond their threshold without having in their pocket, or hung round\r\ntheir neck, a small portion of this metal.\r\n\r\nA fisherman, who for some time had been unsuccessful in his fishing,\r\nimagined that a spell had been cast upon him. No man was better\r\nacquainted with the marks by which the fishermen recognise the spots\r\nwhere the finny tribe are to be found in most abundance. None was\r\nbetter acquainted with the intricate tides and currents which render\r\nthe rocky coasts of the island such a puzzle to navigators, or knew\r\nbetter when to take advantage of them to secure a plentiful catch of\r\nfish. His tackle was good, he used the best and most tempting bait, and\r\nyet, under the most propitious circumstances, with the most favourable\r\nconditions of tide, wind, and weather, day after day passed and he took\r\nnext to nothing. Winter was coming on, and a longer continuance of\r\nbad weather than is usual at that season, combined with the worthless\r\nquality of the fish caught when he did venture out between the\r\ngales,--in short, a continued run of ill-luck,--confirmed him in the\r\nidea that he was bewitched.\r\n\r\nHe confided his fears to an old man of his own profession, who had the\r\nreputation of knowing more than his neighbours, and particularly of\r\nbeing able to give advice in such cases as this, where there was reason\r\nto suppose that some unlawful influence was at work.\r\n\r\nThe old man listened to his tale, confirmed him in the idea that some\r\nevil-disposed person, in league with Satan, had cast an evil eye on\r\nhim, and ended by counselling him always to carry quick-silver about\r\nwith him. With this precaution he told him that he might defy the\r\nspells of all the wizards and witches that ever met on a Friday night\r\nat Catiôroc to pay their homage to Old Nick.\r\n\r\nThe fisherman took the old man’s advice, and procured a small vial\r\ncontaining mercury, which he placed carefully in the purse in which he\r\ncarried his money, when he was fortunate enough to have any.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, from that moment his luck turned, and, a succession of\r\ngood hauls rewarding his industry, the fisherman soon found himself in\r\npossession of what, to him, was a goodly sum of money, and in which\r\nnot a few gold pieces were included. These were, of course, carefully\r\ndeposited in the purse containing the precious amulet, to which he\r\nattributed his good luck and his deliverance from the spell, which, he\r\nno longer doubted, had been cast upon him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old House at Cobo.]\r\n\r\nAlas! his confidence in the charm was destined to be, for a time,\r\nrudely broken. One night, in manœuvring his boat, an accidental blow\r\nfrom some of the gear shattered the bottle containing the quick-silver.\r\nWhat was his dismay the next morning, on opening his purse, to perceive\r\nthat all his gold was turned into silver, and that the silver coins\r\nbore the appearance of vile lead! He was in despair, concluding\r\nvery naturally that he had fallen into the power of some prince of\r\nmagicians, and that henceforth he was a ruined man. He again consulted\r\nhis old friend, whose experience this time proved of more practical\r\nuse than his former advice. The wise man soon saw what had caused\r\nthe apparent change in the coin, and recommended him to go without\r\ndelay to a silversmith, who soon removed the quick-silver with which\r\nthe precious pieces were coated, and restored them to their pristine\r\nbrightness.[204]\r\n\r\n[204] From Mr. John Le Cheminant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURE OF WARTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nThere are certain old men and women who, without pretending to any\r\nsupernatural knowledge, are nevertheless supposed to possess the power\r\nof causing those unsightly excrescences (warts) to disappear, merely\r\nby looking at, and counting, them. Some mystery, however, is attached\r\nto the operation. They may not impart their secret, neither may they\r\nreceive money for their services, although there is no reason why they\r\nshould refuse any other present that may be offered. There is no doubt\r\nthat the hands of growing boys and girls are more often disfigured\r\nby these excrescences than those of adults, and that, at a certain\r\nage, they are apt to disappear almost suddenly. Perhaps this has\r\nbeen noticed by the persons who pretend to the art of removing warts,\r\nand that they do not undertake the cure unless they perceive certain\r\nindications of their being likely to disappear before long by the mere\r\nagency of natural causes. Nevertheless, the cases in which a cure has\r\nbeen effected after all the usual surgical remedies have been resorted\r\nto in vain, are quite sufficiently numerous to justify a belief in the\r\nminds of the vulgar of a possession of this extraordinary gift.\r\n\r\nThe operation, whatever it may be, is designated by the word\r\n“_décompter_,” which may be translated “to uncount,” or “to count\r\nbackwards.”\r\n\r\nThe process by which a wen, or glandular swelling, known in our local\r\ndialect as “_un veuble_,” is to be removed, is expressed by the same\r\nterm, but in this there is no mystery which requires concealment. The\r\ncharm is well known, and may be used by anyone. It is as follows.\r\nThe person who undertakes the cure must begin by making the sign of\r\nthe cross on the part affected, and must then repeat the following\r\nformula:--“_Pour décompter un veuble_.”[205] “_Saint Jean avait un\r\nveuble qui coulait à neuf pertins. De neuf ils vinrent à huit; de huit\r\nils vinrent à sept; de sept ils vinrent à six; de six ils vinrent à\r\ncinq; de cinq ils vinrent à quatre; de quatre ils vinrent à trois; de\r\ntrois ils vinrent à deux; de deux ils vinrent à un; d’un il vint à\r\nrien, et ainsi Saint Jean perdit son veuble._”\r\n\r\nThe second day the operator must begin at “eight,” the day after at\r\n“seven,” and so on until the whole nine are counted off, when, if a\r\ncure is not effected, it must be set down to some neglect or want of\r\nfaith in one or the other of the parties concerned, for no one can\r\nventure to doubt the efficacy of the spell.\r\n\r\nIt will, doubtless, have struck the reader that in this, as well as\r\nin other charms, the number nine plays a conspicuous part. This may\r\npossibly be connected in some way with the practice of the Church of\r\nRome, which, on certain special occasions, orders solemn prayers and\r\nceremonies for nine consecutive days.\r\n\r\nIn most farm-houses there were formerly to be found one or more old\r\noak-chests, sometimes very richly and quaintly carved. In some places\r\nwhere they had been taken care of, they were in excellent preservation,\r\nbut, in the majority of cases, they had given way to those more modern\r\narticles of furniture--chests of drawers and wardrobes--less elegant,\r\nperhaps, but more fashionable, and decidedly more convenient. Now there\r\nare few or none to be met with, the revival of the taste for rich and\r\nelaborate carving having led to a demand for these ancient specimens\r\nof the skill of our forefathers to be remodelled into sideboards,\r\ncabinets, and other similar articles of furniture. When these old\r\ncoffers had ceased to be thought worthy of a place in the bettermost\r\nrooms of the house, they were frequently to be found in the stables\r\nor outhouses, serving as cornbins, or receptacles for all sorts of\r\nrubbish. Still they were sometimes remembered, for old people would\r\ntell of their efficacy in curing erysipelas, or, as it is locally\r\ntermed, “_le faeu sauvage_.” The chests chosen for this purpose were\r\nthose ornamented with Scriptural subjects or figures of Apostles and\r\nSaints, and the cure was supposed to be effected by opening and\r\nshutting the lid of the coffer nine times, so as to fan the face of the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nOne of the many mysterious ills to which poor human nature is subject,\r\nis known as “_la maladie de la nère poule_.” This is to be removed by\r\nprocuring a perfectly black hen, and swinging her round the head of the\r\nsufferer three times.\r\n\r\nTo cure an equally undefined affection known as “_le mal volant_” the\r\npatient must also take a black hen, and, holding her in both hands,\r\nmust rub that part of the body in which the pain is felt. The hen used\r\nin this incantation must be bought; if a gift, the charm would fail of\r\nits effect. After having been used it must not be kept or put to death,\r\nbut given away. The classical reader will not require to be reminded\r\nthat cocks were sacrificed to Æsculapius.\r\n\r\n[205] From Mrs. Dalgairns and Rachel Duport.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELTS.\r\n\r\nThese interesting relics of the aboriginal inhabitants of the island\r\nare called by the country people “_fouïdres_,” _i.e._ thunderbolts. It\r\nis firmly believed that the house which has the happiness to possess\r\none of them will neither be struck by lightning nor consumed by fire.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that animals that are sick can be cured by giving them\r\nwater to drink in which a celt has been dipped.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER COUNTER-CHARM FOR WITCHCRAFT.\r\n\r\nWhen a person has reason to believe that either himself or any of his\r\nbelongings is under the influence of a spell, he should procure the\r\nheart of an animal--that of a black sheep is supposed to be the most\r\nefficacious,--and, having stuck it over thickly in every part with new\r\npins or nails, put it down to roast before a strong fire. Care must,\r\nhowever, have been taken previously to close up all means of entry into\r\nthe house, even to stuffing up the key-hole. The heart no sooner begins\r\nto feel the influence of the fire than doleful cries are heard from\r\nwithout, which increase more and more as the roasting goes on. Loud\r\nknocks are next heard at the door, and urgent appeals for admission are\r\nmade, so urgent that few have the heart to withstand them. No sooner,\r\nhowever, is the door opened than all the clamour ceases. No one is\r\nseen outside, and, on looking at the heart, it is found to be burnt\r\nto a cinder. The charm has failed, and those who tried it remain as\r\nmuch under the influence of the sorcerer as ever, with the additional\r\ncertainty of having offended their enemy without a chance of pardon or\r\npity on his part, nay, they know that they have only exposed themselves\r\nto greater persecution in revenge for the pain they have made him\r\nsuffer; for it is universally believed that the wizards or witches are\r\nirresistibly attracted to the place where this counter-spell is being\r\nperformed; and that, while it lasts, the tortures of the damned are\r\nsuffered by them. What would occur if the spell were persevered in and\r\nthe door kept closed is not generally known, but it is thought that as\r\nthe heart dried up before the flames, the sorcerer would wither away,\r\nand that, with the last drop of moisture, his wicked soul would depart\r\nto the place of everlasting torment.[206]\r\n\r\n[206] From Charlotte Du Port.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEIGNEUR OF ST. GEORGE AND THE DÉSORCELLEUR.\r\n\r\nIt is related that towards the end of the eighteenth century a number\r\nof country people were assembled in a farm-house in the parish of\r\nSte. Marie-du-Castel, for the purpose of putting into practice the\r\ncounter-spell described in the preceding paragraph, or one of a similar\r\nnature; for it is believed that the same end may be attained by\r\nsetting a cauldron on the hearth, and boiling the heart with certain\r\nherbs, gathered with some peculiar precautions, and known only to the\r\n“_désorcelleurs_,” as the white-witches who generally conduct these\r\nceremonies are called in the local dialect. The doors of the house, as\r\nis required in these cases, had been carefully closed and fastened,\r\nand the charm was, to all appearance, progressing favourably, when a\r\nknock was heard at the door. No one answered, for fear of breaking\r\nthe spell, but all remained in breathless and awe-stricken silence,\r\nbelieving firmly that their incantation was working favourably and in\r\naccordance with their wishes. The visitor on the outside, who could\r\nplainly see that the house was not untenanted, grew impatient at not\r\nbeing admitted, and called out with a loud and authoritative voice,\r\nto know why an entrance was refused him. The voice was that of a\r\ngentleman residing in the neighbourhood, the Seigneur de St. George, a\r\nmagistrate universally respected for his integrity, and beloved for his\r\nbenevolence. The inmates of the dwelling durst no longer keep him out;\r\nthe door was at last unbolted, but, as the common belief is that the\r\nfirst person who applies for admission after the spell has begun is the\r\nsorcerer, the assembled peasants were at their wits’ end to account for\r\nhis presence.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman was not long in perceiving how matters stood. He lectured\r\nthe assembly soundly on their folly and superstition, and, recognising\r\namong them the “_désorcelleur_,” whom he well knew to be a designing\r\nknave, making his profit out of the credulity of his neighbours, he\r\ndrove him out of the house with some well-applied stripes from a\r\ndog-whip he chanced to have in his hand.\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether the Seigneur de St. George succeeded in\r\nconvincing any of his neighbours of the folly of believing in\r\nwitchcraft; it is rather thought, on the contrary, that from that day\r\nforward they considered him wiser than need be![207]\r\n\r\n[207] From W. P. Métivier, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nLove Spells.\r\n\r\n    “A love-potion works more by the strength of charm than\r\n    nature.”--Collier, _On Popularity_.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of Holy Wells mention has already been made of a means\r\nresorted to by maidens to ascertain who their future husbands are to\r\nbe, but this is not the only manner by which this most interesting\r\ninformation is to be obtained.\r\n\r\nSt. Thomas’ Night, La Longue Veille, Christmas Eve, and the last night\r\nof the year, are all seasons in which it is supposed that the powers of\r\nthe air, devils, witches, fairies, and goblins, are abroad and active,\r\nand accordingly, these days, like Hallowe’en in Scotland, are chosen\r\nfor the performance of spells by which some of the secrets of futurity\r\nmay be discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Manor House, Anneville.]\r\n\r\nSome of these charms must be performed alone--others are social, but\r\nall require strict silence. As to the social spells, it is easy to\r\nconceive that when a number of girls are met together to try their\r\nfortunes, the charm is frequently broken, either by the fears of the\r\nsuperstitious, or the laughter of the incredulous. We will begin with\r\nthe solitary spells. On St. Thomas’ Night the girl who is desirous\r\nof knowing whom she is to marry, must take a golden pippin, and,\r\nwhen about retiring to rest, must pass two pins crossways through\r\nit, and lay it under her pillow. Some say that the pippin should be\r\nwrapped up in the stocking taken from the left leg--others that this\r\nstocking should be taken off last and thrown over the left shoulder.\r\nWhich is right, we have no means of ascertaining, but doubtless the\r\nefficacy of the spell depends on following the correct formula. It is\r\nthen necessary to get into bed backwards, and repeat the following\r\nincantation thrice:--\r\n\r\n    _“Saint Thomas, Saint Thomas,_\r\n    _Le plus court, le plus bas,_\r\n    _Fais moi voir en m’endormant_\r\n    _Celui qui sera mon amant,_\r\n    _Et le pays, et la contrée._\r\n    _Où il fait sa demeurée,_\r\n    _Et le métier qu’il sait faire_\r\n    _Devant moi qu’il vienne faire._\r\n    _Qu’il soit beau ou qu’il soit laid_\r\n    _Tel qu’il sera je l’aimerai._\r\n    _Saint Thomas, fait moi la grâce_\r\n    _Que je le voie, que je l’embrasse.”_\r\n                      _“Ainsi soit il.”_\r\n\r\nNot another word must be spoken, and, if the rite has been duly\r\nperformed, the desired knowledge will be communicated in a dream. There\r\nare different versions of the words to be repeated. One of them avoids\r\na direct invocation of the Saint, and begins thus:--\r\n\r\n    _“Le jour Saint Thomas,_\r\n    _Le plus court, le plus bas,_\r\n    _Je prie Dieu incessamment_\r\n    _De me faire voir en dormant_\r\n    _Celui qui doit être mon amant, etc.”_[208]\r\n\r\nAnother charm consists in placing two fronds of agrimony, each bearing\r\nnine leaflets, crosswise under the pillow, and securing them by means\r\nof two new pins, also crossed. The future husband is sure to appear in\r\na dream.[209]\r\n\r\nThe name of the future husband may be discovered by writing the letters\r\nof the alphabet on a piece of paper, cutting them apart, and, when\r\ngetting into bed, just after extinguishing the light, throwing them\r\ninto a basin or bucket of water. Next morning the bits of paper which\r\nfloat with the written side uppermost indicate the name. This charm is\r\nefficacious on Midsummer Eve.[210]\r\n\r\nThe trade of the husband that is to be may be guessed at by throwing\r\nthe white of a raw egg into a glass of water, and exposing it to\r\nthe rays of the noonday sun at Christmas or Midsummer. The egg in\r\ncoagulating assumes curious and fantastic forms, and these are\r\ninterpreted to denote the trade or profession of him whom the girl who\r\ntries the charm is destined to marry. A sort of divination to the same\r\neffect is also practised by pouring molten lead into water.\r\n\r\nA spell which requires to be performed in society is as follows. On\r\nany of the solemn nights about Christmastide, when spells are supposed\r\nto be efficaciously used, a number of girls meet together and make a\r\nchaplet in perfect silence, by stringing grains of allspice and berries\r\nof holly alternately, placing, at intervals of twelve, an acorn, of\r\nwhich there must be as many as there are persons in the company.\r\n\r\nThis chaplet is twined round a log of wood, which is then placed on the\r\nblazing hearth, and, as the last acorn is being consumed, each of the\r\nyoung women sees the form of her future husband pass between her and\r\nthe fire.[211]\r\n\r\nAnother social spell consists in making a cake, to which each person in\r\nthe company contributes a portion of flour, salt, and water, together\r\nwith a hair from her own head, or parings from the nails. When the cake\r\nis kneaded--an operation in which all must take a part--it is placed on\r\nthe hearth to bake. A table is then set out in the middle of the room,\r\nand covered with a clean cloth. As many plates are laid out as there\r\nare persons present, and as many seats placed round the table, each\r\ngirl designating her own. The cake, when thoroughly baked, is placed\r\non the board, and the girls watch in solemn silence until the hour of\r\nmidnight, when, exactly as the clock strikes twelve, the appearances\r\nof the future husbands are seen to enter, and seat themselves in the\r\nchairs prepared for them; each girl, however, seeing only her own\r\nhusband that is to be, those of her companions remaining invisible to\r\nher. Should anyone of the party be destined to die unmarried, instead\r\nof the appearance of a man, she sees a coffin. The spell is broken,\r\nshould a single word be uttered from the moment when the ingredients\r\nfor the cake are first produced, until the whole of the ceremony is\r\ncompleted.[212]\r\n\r\nThe charmed cake may also be used by a person alone, in which case the\r\nmanner of proceeding is as follows. The cake, which should be composed\r\nof equal quantities of flour, salt, and soot, must be made and baked\r\nin secret and in silence. On retiring to rest it must be divided into\r\ntwo equal portions, one of which must be eaten by the person who tries\r\nthe charm, but no water or other liquid is to be drunk with it. The\r\nother half is to be wrapped up in the garter taken from the left leg,\r\nand placed under the pillow. At midnight the form of the future husband\r\nwill stand at the bedside and be seen by his intended bride.[213]\r\n\r\n[208] See _Notes and Queries_, IV. Series. Vol. VIII., p. 506.\r\n_Derbyshire Folk-Lore._\r\n\r\nOn St. Thomas’ Eve there used to be a custom among girls to procure a\r\nlarge red onion, into which, after peeling, they would stick nine pins,\r\nand say:--\r\n\r\n    “Good St. Thomas, do me right,\r\n    Send me my true love this night,\r\n    In his clothes and his array,\r\n    Which he weareth every day.”\r\n\r\nEight pins were stuck round one in the centre, to which was given the\r\nname of the swain--the “true love.”\r\n\r\nThe onion was placed under the pillow on going to bed, and they would\r\ndream of the desired person.\r\n\r\n[209] From Miss Lane.\r\n\r\n[210] From Miss Lane.\r\n\r\n[211] From Miss Lane.\r\n\r\n[212] From the late Miss Sophy Brock and Rachel Du Port.\r\n\r\n[213] From Miss Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF A LOVE SPELL.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that these love charms can always be tried\r\nwith impunity. Like all other forms of divination they are sinful, and\r\ninstances are on record in which punishment has followed the unhallowed\r\nattempt to pry into the secrets of futurity so wisely hidden from our\r\nmortal ken. It would seem that not merely the wraith or similitude of\r\nthe destined husband can be made to show itself, but that, by some\r\nunexplained and mysterious agency, the actual presence in the body can\r\nbe completed, at whatever distance the man may at that moment be. To\r\nthe unfortunate individual who is made the victim of these practices\r\nthe whole appears the effect of a frightful dream, attended with much\r\nsuffering. It is related that an officer, thus forced to show himself,\r\nleft behind him a sword, which was found by the young woman after his\r\ndeparture, and carefully hidden away. In process of time he came to the\r\nisland, saw the girl, fell in love with her, and was married. For many\r\nyears they lived happily together, until, one day, in turning out the\r\ncontents of an old coffer, he found at the bottom of it the identical\r\nsword which had disappeared from his possession in so unaccountable\r\nand mysterious a manner. The memory of the frightful dream in which he\r\nhad endured so much flashed across his mind. In a frenzy of passion he\r\nsought his wife, and, upbraiding her with having been to him the cause\r\nof dreadful suffering, and of having put him in peril of his life by\r\nher magical practices, plunged the sword into her breast.[214]\r\n\r\n[214] From Rachel Du Port.\r\n\r\nSee _Les Veillées Allemandes_, by Grimm. _La Veille de St. André_, Vol.\r\nI., p. 201.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITCHES AND THE WHITE-THORN.\r\n\r\nThere appear to be some superstitious notions with regard to the\r\nconnection of witchcraft with the white-thorn. Witches are suspected\r\nof meeting at night under its shade. An old man of very eccentric\r\nhabits not many years since still inhabited the ruined manor house of\r\nAnneville, once the residence of the ancient family of de Chesney, sold\r\nin 1509 to Nicholas Fashin, and subsequently passing by inheritance\r\ninto the Andros family, in whose possession it still remains.\r\n\r\nHe passed with his neighbours for a wizard, although he only professed\r\nto be a “_désorcelleur_” or white-witch, and was said to have been in\r\nthe habit of taking those who applied to him to be unbewitched to a\r\nvery old thorn-bush, which had grown up within the walls of an ancient\r\nsquare tower adjoining the house, and there, before sunrise, making\r\nthem go through certain evolutions which were supposed to counteract\r\nthe spells which had been cast upon them.[215]\r\n\r\nThe hawthorn, or at least such specimens of the tree as are\r\nremarkable for their age, their size, or their gnarled branches,\r\nseems to be associated in the minds of our peasantry with magic and\r\nmagical practices. The wizards and witches, when, in their nocturnal\r\nexcursions they take the form of hares, rabbits, cats, or other\r\nanimals, assemble under the shadow, or in the vicinity of some ancient\r\nthorn, and amuse themselves with skipping round it in the moonlight.\r\nThe “_désorcelleur_” who pretends to the power of counteracting the\r\nspells of witches, and freeing the unfortunate victims of their art\r\nfrom their evil influence, resorts with the sufferer to some noted\r\nthorn-bush, and there goes through the ceremonies and incantations\r\nwhich are to free the sufferer. A large and very old tree, on the\r\nestate of a gentleman in the parish of St. Saviour’s, was, in days\r\ngone by, constantly resorted to at night for the purpose of cutting\r\nfrom it small portions of the wood to be carried about the person as a\r\nsafeguard against witchcraft. It is essential to the efficacy of this\r\ncharm that the part of the branch cut off should be that from which\r\nthree spurs issue.[216]\r\n\r\nWilliam Le Poidevin was told by his grandmother that the\r\n“blanche-épine” is “le roi des bois;” the wood must not be employed for\r\ncommon uses. A boat or ship, into the construction of which it entered,\r\nwould infallibly be lost or come to grief.[217]\r\n\r\n[215] From the present proprietor of Anneville.\r\n\r\n[216] From George Allez, Esq., who calls the tree he speaks of\r\n“aube-épine,” but declares it was not a hawthorn. May it not be a\r\nmountain ash or rowan tree?\r\n\r\n[217] Among the Blakeway MSS. in the Bodleian Library I found noticed\r\nthese superstitious cures for whooping-cough.\r\n\r\n“Near to Button Oak, in the Forest of Bewdley, grows a thorn in the\r\nform of an arch, one end in the county of Salop, the other in Stafford.\r\nThis is visited by numbers in order to make their children pass under\r\nit for the cure of the whooping-cough.”--_Notes and Queries_, IV.\r\nSeries, III. 216.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVINING ROD.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a work published in London in 1815, but\r\nwhich is now very rarely to be met with, gives so good an account of\r\nthe manner in which springs of water are believed in these islands to\r\nbe discovered by means of the divining rod, that we have no hesitation\r\nin copying it at length.\r\n\r\nThe work bears the following title: “General View of the Agriculture\r\nand Present State of the Islands of Normandy subject to the Crown\r\nof Great Britain, drawn up for the consideration of the Board of\r\nAgriculture and Internal Improvement,” by Thomas Quayle, Esq.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oratory Window, Anneville.]\r\n\r\nThe passage in question will be found at p. 31. _Baguette\r\nDivinatoire._--“The opinion still prevails in Jersey, of a power,\r\npossessed by certain individuals, of discovering by means of a rod\r\nof hazel or of some few trees, in what spot springs of water may be\r\nfound. A respectable farmer in the parish of St. Sauveur is persuaded\r\nthat he is endowed with this faculty, of which he says he discovered\r\nhimself to be possessed in consequence of observing and imitating the\r\nceremonies employed for a similar purpose by an emigrant priest. The\r\nfarmer, on repeating these himself, found them equally efficacious, and\r\nafterwards received from the priest instructions for his exercise of\r\nthe water-finding art.\r\n\r\n“He first removes from his person every particle of metal. A slender\r\nrod of hazel, terminating in two twigs, the whole about ten inches in\r\nlength, is taken into both hands, one holding each twig. The forked\r\npoint of the rod, and palms of the hands, as closed, are turned\r\nupwards. The operator then walks forward, with his eye directed on\r\nthe forked end of the rod. When he approaches a spot where a spring\r\nis concealed, the elevated point of the rod begins to wave and bend\r\ndownwards; at the spot itself it becomes inverted.\r\n\r\n“On the 28th of August, 1812, these ceremonies were practised in\r\nthe presence of three gentlemen, then and still unconvinced of the\r\nexistence of any such power. The farmer had, at their request, civilly\r\nleft his harvest, and repeated his practice for their satisfaction.\r\nHe first held the rod over his own well, where it did not bend, in\r\nconsequence, as he asserted, of the spring not being perennial. He\r\nthen slowly walked forward with the rod of hazel held in his hands; at\r\na particular spot, near his own dwelling, the forked end of the rod\r\nbegan to be agitated and droop downward; at length, as he proceeded,\r\nit became nearly or quite inverted. He then marked the spot, walked\r\naway, and, setting off in another direction, returned toward the same\r\nspot. When he arrived near it, the end of the rod again began to droop,\r\nand, at the spot, was, as before, inverted. When he was proceeding, the\r\npersons present carefully watched his hands, but could not discern any\r\nmotion in either, or any other visible means by which the rod could be\r\naffected. One of them took the rod into his own hands, and, repeating\r\nthe same practice over the same ground, the rod did not bend.\r\n\r\n“Whether under the designated spot a spring exists or not was not\r\nexamined; probably there may, quite apart from any virtue in the\r\n_Baguette divinatoire_.\r\n\r\n“On several occasions the farmer has been requested to seek for water,\r\nand it has not only been found, but nearly at the depth which he\r\nindicated. He is a man of good character, of simple manners, obliging\r\nand communicative. Being in easy circumstances, he exercises his art\r\nwithout reward. The priest had communicated some rules, to enable him\r\nto judge of the exact distance of the water from the surface. These, he\r\nobserves, proved fallacious, and the only guide he has for judging of\r\nthe depth of the water, is his observation of the distance between the\r\nspot at which the forked end of the rod begins to be agitated, and that\r\nat which, when he arrives, the rod becomes wholly inverted.”\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that Quayle does not assert that he himself saw\r\nthe farmer practise his art, but merely that it had been witnessed\r\nby three gentlemen in 1812. The copy of Quayle’s work, however, from\r\nwhich the extract was made, contains a very interesting marginal note\r\nin pencil, in the handwriting of a former owner of the book, Peter Le\r\nPelley, Esq., Seigneur of Sark, who was, unfortunately, drowned by\r\nthe capsizing of a boat in which he was crossing from that island to\r\nGuernsey in March, 1839. He says:--\r\n\r\n“I have seen it practised by Mr. Moullin, of _Le Ponchez_, at Sark\r\nand Brechou; and at Brechou the forked stick became so inverted that\r\nit split at the fork. He did it in my presence on gold, silver, and\r\nwater, and the rod inverted over them. He first rubbed his hands with\r\nthe substance to be sought for, and, if water, dipped his hands in it,\r\nand held his two thumbs on the extremity of the forks. That there is a\r\nvirtue in the using of the _Baguette divinatoire_ is incontestable, the\r\nreason I deem unknown. May not electricity or magnetism be concerned in\r\nit? It turned in the hands of some Sarkmen who previously were ignorant\r\nof possessing that power. _Ergo_ it is independent of the will.\r\n\r\n“On Mr. Moullin’s indication, who told me I should find water at twenty\r\nto twenty-two feet at Brechou, I had a well dug. The men blasted all\r\nthe way through the solid rock without finding any water, and at\r\nnineteen to twenty feet, on making a hole with a jumper, the water\r\nsprang up and filled the well. Mr. Moullin found a ring that had been\r\nlost by means of the _Baguette divinatoire_.”\r\n\r\nBrechou, mentioned in this note, is a small islet or dependency of\r\nSark, more generally known by the name of l’Ile des Marchants, a\r\nname it derived from some former proprietors, members of the ancient\r\nGuernsey family of Le Marchant; and for those who are unacquainted with\r\nthe art of quarrying, it may not be amiss to explain that a “jumper” is\r\nan iron tool with which holes are bored in the rock for the purpose of\r\nblasting it with gunpowder, and so facilitating its removal piecemeal.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the present compilation had an opportunity of witnessing\r\nexperiments with the divining rod, when attending, in September, 1875,\r\nat Guingamp, in Brittany, a meeting of the “Association Bretonne,”\r\na combination of the Agricultural and Archæological Societies of\r\nthat Province. The place where the experiments were made was a piece\r\nof grass-land at the head of a small valley, and the course of an\r\nunderground stream seemed to be traced by the deflections of the rod,\r\nuntil it pointed almost perpendicularly downwards over a certain spot\r\nin the garden of a neighbouring _château_, where, we were told, there\r\nwas no doubt a strong spring would be found at no great distance\r\nfrom the surface, which, taking into consideration the nature of the\r\nlocality, seemed highly probable. It is certain that in the hands of\r\nsome who had never seen the experiment performed before, and who at\r\nfirst professed incredulity, the rod appeared ready to twist itself\r\nout of their grasp as soon as they drew near to the place where water\r\nwas supposed to be, while with others, who were disposed to believe\r\nonly the evidence of what they witnessed with their own eyes, the\r\nmysterious twig remained perfectly still. No attempt at deceit could be\r\ndetected. The persons who made the experiment were gentlemen, and men\r\nof education, although, as Bretons, not perhaps quite free from that\r\ntinge of superstitious feeling which is so characteristic of all Celtic\r\nnations. The writer is bound to add that, neither in his own hands,\r\nnor in those of his companion and fellow countryman, was the slightest\r\neffect produced, although they were carefully instructed how to hold\r\nthe rod, and they went over the very same ground where, in the hands of\r\nothers, the rod had been visibly affected.\r\n\r\nIt is not irrelevant to add that in Cornwall, and other mining\r\ncountries, the divining rod is said to be used for the purpose of\r\ndiscovering and tracing veins of metalliferous ore.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEES PUT IN MOURNING.\r\n\r\nFew insects besides the bee and the silk-worm have been pressed into\r\nthe service of man--at least in such a manner as to be looked upon as\r\ndomesticated--and of these the bee, from its superior intelligence, and\r\nthe striking fact of its living in community, with the semblance of\r\na well-organised government, has, from the earliest times, attracted\r\nthe attention and excited the interest of mankind. It is asserted by\r\nthose who keep these useful insects, as well as by naturalists who have\r\nmade them their especial study, that they recognise their masters and\r\nthe members of their families, and that these may approach them with\r\nimpunity when a stranger would run great risk of being stung. If this\r\nis really the case, it is not difficult to conceive how, among a people\r\nrude and ignorant, and yet observant of the phenomena of nature, the\r\nbee should come to be regarded with particular respect. It is probably\r\nfrom a feeling of this kind that the custom arose of informing the\r\nbees when a death occurs in a family. The correct way of performing the\r\nceremony is this. One of the household must take the door-key, and,\r\nproceeding to the hives, knock with it, and give notice to the bees in\r\na whisper of the sad event which has just taken place, affixing, at the\r\nsame time, a small shred of black crape or other stuff to each of the\r\nhives. If this formality is omitted, it is believed that the bees will\r\ndie, or forsake the place. The same custom exists in other countries,\r\nbut in Guernsey it is also thought proper to give them notice of\r\nweddings, and to deck the hives with white streamers.\r\n\r\nA swarm of bees ought not to be sold for money, if you wish it to\r\nprosper. It should be given or exchanged for something of equal value.\r\nA money price is, however, sometimes agreed for, but in this case the\r\nsum must not be paid in any baser metal than gold. In following a swarm\r\nof bees, besides beating on pots and pans to make them settle, it is\r\ncustomary to call out to them “_Align’ous, mes p’tits, align’ous_.”[218]\r\n\r\n[218] From J. de Garis, Esq., J.

As to the herbs themselves it is not easy at the\r\npresent day, when old traditions are rapidly passing away, to obtain a\r\ncorrect list of them, but the following is as correct as we can make\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St. Peter Port Harbour, 1852, showing the Old North\r\nPier.]\r\n\r\n_La Poumillière_, or Helleborus viridis. Métivier, in his Dictionary,\r\npage 401, says of this plant that it was originally held in great\r\nveneration by the Greeks and Romans. He also says that it was used in\r\ncases of consumption in cattle by our local veterinary doctors. They\r\npierced the dewlap or the ear of the affected animal, and inserted in\r\nthe hole one of the small roots of this plant. This induced an abundant\r\nsuppuration, which sometimes proved beneficial.\r\n\r\n_La Cassidone_, or French lavender. Boiste, in his dictionary, says\r\nthat its flowers and leaves promote salivation. There is a proverb to\r\nthe effect that:\r\n\r\n    _“L’hyssope tout ma’ développe_\r\n    _La cassidoune tout ma’ détrone.”_\r\n\r\n_Le Rosmarin_, or rosemary. It is considered unlucky not to have a\r\nplant of rosemary in one’s garden, but it is a plant that should\r\nnever be _bought_, but grown for you, and presented by a friend and\r\nwell-wisher.\r\n\r\n_La Petite Sauche_, or small-leaved sage.\r\n\r\n_Le Grànd Consoul_, or comfrey. Of this the root is the part used.\r\n\r\n_La Rue._ Rue, which was supposed to have a potent effect on the eyes,\r\nand bestow second sight.\r\n\r\n_L’Alliène_, or wormwood.\r\n\r\n_La Marjolaine_, or marjoram, and\r\n\r\n_La Campana_, or vervain, the “holy herb” of the Druids.\r\n\r\nThis list by no means exhausts the plants possessed of healing powers.\r\n\r\nGeorge Métivier, in his _Souvenirs Historiques_, chapter IV. and\r\nII., speaks of a sacred briar, called “pied-de-chat,” worn as a\r\nwaist-belt as an infallible talisman against witchcraft. When a man\r\nwas afflicted with boils, he had to pass, fasting and in silence, for\r\nnine consecutive mornings, under an arch of this same briar. The green\r\nsprigs of broom, however, are believed to be equally efficacious in\r\naverting the evil influence of spells.\r\n\r\nIn planting a bed of the smaller herbs, to render them thoroughly\r\nefficacious they should be planted under a volley of minor oaths, such\r\nas “goderabetin” or “godzamin.” It is not expedient that the oaths\r\nshould be too blood curdling.\r\n\r\nGeorge Métivier alludes to this, and says he himself knew old gardeners\r\nwho made a constant practice of this prehistoric method, and quotes\r\nPliny, Vol. X., p. 77: “He was enjoined to sow (basil) with curses and\r\noaths, and then, so that it should succeed, to beat the ground.”\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--“MAL DE POULE.”--In St. Martin’s parish lived an old\r\nwoman who had an infallible cure for sick headaches. The patient was\r\nput to bed, and a live chicken, with its beak stuffed with parsley,\r\nenveloped in a cloth, was tied on his head. She then muttered a prayer\r\nover it, and tied it again, still more firmly, round the patient’s\r\nforehead. As the chicken died the headache ceased.--_From Miss Thoume._\r\n\r\n\r\nKING’S EVIL.\r\n\r\nThat the belief in touching for King’s Evil prevailed in the island is\r\nevident from the following extracts.\r\n\r\n“Extraits des Comptes des Diacres de l’Eglise de la Ville, contenus\r\ndans un Livre en la possession du Procureur des Pauvres de cette\r\nparoisse, endossé ‘Aux Pauvres de la Ville.’”\r\n\r\n“Le Vendredy, 24 Aout, 1677, l’on a trouvé dans le tronq la somme\r\nde deux cents vingt livres tournois en or, argent, sols marquez, et\r\ndoubles. Item, vingt et quatre livres tournois, qui ont été données\r\nà la veuve de Nicolas Corbel pour son enfant, qui est incomodé des\r\necrouëlles, et qui s’en va à Londres pour estre touché de sa Ma^{té}.”\r\n\r\n“Le 26 Aout, 1678, a été tiré hors du tronq la so͠e de trente livres\r\ntournois, qui ont été delivrés à Caterine de Garis, fem͠e de Jean\r\nHairon, pour aller en Angleterre y faire toucher par Sa Majesté une\r\nfillette qui est affligée des ecrouëlles.

Most of these are simple enough, but in the mouth of a\r\nskillful story-teller are still capable of exciting a laugh among the\r\nunsophisticated audiences to whom they are addressed.\r\n\r\nA favourite class of stories were those in which the inhabitants of the\r\nsister islands of Jersey, Alderney, and Sark, were held up to ridicule,\r\nand the following tales, trifling and absurd as they are, may suffice\r\nto give some idea of this sort of narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE MEN OF ALDERNEY SOWED, AND WHAT CAME OF IT.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, before the lighthouse on the dangerous reef of the\r\nCasquet rocks was erected, a vessel was wrecked on Alderney. Such\r\noccurrences in those days were not uncommon, but so cut off from\r\nintercourse with the rest of the world were the inhabitants of the\r\nisland, that they were, for the most part, totally ignorant of the\r\nnature and value of the goods which the waves so frequently cast up on\r\ntheir inhospitable shores, and it is related that when a Dutch East\r\nIndiaman, laden with cinnamon, was wrecked on the coast, the people\r\nrejoiced in the seasonable supply of fuel that was afforded them, and\r\nemployed the precious bundles of aromatic bark in heating their ovens.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion, however, to which our present story refers, among\r\nthe articles saved from the wreck there was a barrel, which, on being\r\nopened, was found to contain a number of small packages carefully done\r\nup in paper. Some of these were opened and proved to be needles of\r\nvarious sizes, but the oldest inhabitant had never seen anything of the\r\nsort, and many were the speculations as to what they could possibly be.\r\nA general meeting of the islanders was called to deliberate, and many\r\nconjectures were hazarded. At last the opinion of an old grey-headed\r\nman prevailed. He expressed it to be his firm conviction that the\r\nstrange commodity could be nothing else but the seed of some new kind\r\nof herb or useful root, and that the best thing to be done was to make\r\nchoice of one of the most fertile spots on the Blaies, and to proceed\r\nforthwith to plough and sow.\r\n\r\nHis advice was received with acclamation, and immediately acted upon,\r\nbut alas for their hopes! Spring came, and nothing but an unusually\r\nfine crop of weeds--always too common--appeared on the carefully-tilled\r\nland.[219]\r\n\r\n[219] “Semer des Aiguilles.” See _Proverbes du Pays de Béarn_, page 17.\r\n\r\n“Semia Agulhes--Semer des Aiguilles. Se donner une peine inutile, faire\r\nun travail qui ne produira rien. En Béarn, comme dans la Gascogne,\r\n(Bladé, Prov.) on attribuait aux habitants de quelques villages le fait\r\nd’avoir semé des aiguilles, dans l’espoir qu’elles multiplieraient\r\ncomme du blé.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE JERSEYMEN ATTEMPTED TO CARRY OFF GUERNSEY.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to understand why it should be so, but it is\r\nnevertheless a fact that the inhabitants of Jersey, although conceiving\r\nthemselves a far superior race, have always looked with eyes of envy\r\nand jealousy on the smaller and less pretentious island of Guernsey.\r\nPerhaps the greater commercial prosperity which the possession of a\r\ngood roadstead and port conferred on the latter at a time when Jersey\r\ncould boast of neither, and the advantages arising in consequence from\r\na freer intercourse with strangers, in days when these islands were\r\nalmost cut off from the rest of the world, may have contributed to\r\nproduce and keep alive these feelings. Certain it is that the Jerseymen\r\nhave at all times had the reputation of being always ready, when an\r\nopportunity presented itself, to play a bad turn to their neighbours of\r\nGuernsey.\r\n\r\nIt is said that three audacious mariners, who had come over from the\r\nlarger island with a cargo of agricultural produce, after disposing of\r\ntheir wares to good advantage, and having indulged perhaps a little\r\ntoo freely in the excellent cider of the place, conceived the bold\r\ndesign of carrying away the island with them and joining it on to\r\nJersey! Could they succeed in effecting the annexation, what credit\r\nwould they not gain for themselves! What advantages would not accrue to\r\ntheir native isle!\r\n\r\nTheir hated rivals--for so, as true Jerseymen, they looked on the quiet\r\nindustrious inhabitants of Guernsey--would be obliged to acknowledge\r\ntheir superiority, and submit quietly to the supremacy of the larger\r\nisle.\r\n\r\nThey were not long in putting their project into execution. Maître\r\nPh’lip, the captain of the boat, gave directions to his cousin Pierre\r\nto make fast a hawser to one of the needle-like rocks that stand out so\r\nboldly from the extremity of St. Martin’s Point. The order was obeyed,\r\nthe wind was fair, all sails were hoisted and they steered towards\r\nJersey, singing out in full chorus:--\r\n\r\n    _“Hale, Pierre! Hale, Jean!_\r\n    _Guernsi s’en vient!”_\r\n\r\nThey made sure that Guernsey could not resist the tug, and that the\r\nmorning light would find it stranded in St. Ouen’s Bay. But they had\r\nmiscalculated the strength of the hawser. It snapped short, and the\r\nsudden jerk sent them all sprawling to the bottom of the boat, too much\r\nbruised and discomfited to think of renewing their bold attempt.[220]\r\n\r\n[220] See _Melusine_, p. 321. Note (i).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Farm House at St. Saviour’s.\r\n\r\nFrom a Pencil Drawing, early in the Nineteenth Century.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JERSEY GALLOWS.\r\n\r\nIn Guernsey it is told as a joke against their neighbours the\r\nJerseymen, that when there was a question of rebuilding the gallows,\r\nhitherto a wooden structure, but falling to pieces from rottenness, the\r\nProcureur de la Reine recommended that the uprights should be of stone,\r\nas more desirable, and strengthened his argument by saying, “It will\r\nlast for ever, and serve for us and for our children.”\r\n\r\n\r\nProverbial Stories.\r\n\r\nThe terse form of an aphorism is not only one in which the proverbial\r\nphilosophy of a people may be expressed. The idea is frequently\r\nexpanded into a short tale or fable, and in this shape is often alluded\r\nto and understood, although perhaps the story or anecdote is unknown or\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nTo give an example. The meaning of the words “A Cat’s Paw” is perfectly\r\ncomprehended by many, who possibly have never heard or read of the\r\nfable of “The Cat, the Monkey, and the Chestnuts.”\r\n\r\nA few of these stories, as they are related in Guernsey, are given\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA DÉLAISSANCE.\r\n\r\nAlthough scarcely a year passes without some fact coming to light which\r\nshows the folly and imprudence of the proceedings, it is by no means\r\nuncommon for old people to make over by a legal instrument, called\r\n“_Contrat de Délaissance_,” the whole of their property to a child or\r\nother relative, on condition of being maintained for the rest of their\r\ndays in a manner befitting their station in life. They have generally\r\ncause to repent the deed, for, even if kindly treated, there is a\r\nfeeling of dependence, and a want of liberty of action, which cannot\r\nfail to be irksome to one who has hitherto been his own master, and\r\nfree to act in any way he pleased.\r\n\r\nIt is related that a man who had given over his estate, and all that he\r\npossessed, to an only son, ordered, after a time, a strong coffer, with\r\na secure lock, to be made. The son indulged him in the fancy, wondering\r\nwhat he could want the box for, but hoping perhaps that he might have\r\nkept back some hoard of money or other valuables he wished to secure.\r\nThe old man kept his own secret. Not a soul but himself knew what the\r\nbox contained. At last he died. The son hastened to open the coffer,\r\nhoping to find a treasure. What was his astonishment and disappointment\r\nat finding only a large mallet, such as is used for driving in the\r\nstakes to which the cattle are tethered. A writing attached to it\r\nexplained the old man’s meaning. The person who related the story had\r\nforgotten the exact words, but it was a rude rhyme, beginning thus:--\r\n\r\n“_Ce maillot--ou un plus gros s’il le faut_.”[221]\r\n\r\nThe substance of the whole was that the mallet would be advantageously\r\nemployed in knocking out the brains of the man who was fool enough to\r\ndispossess himself, during his lifetime, of the control of his own\r\nproperty.[222]\r\n\r\nThe following legend, from the supplement to the _Illustrated News_,\r\nFebruary 7th, 1874, seems to have a common origin with the preceding.\r\n\r\nJehan Connaxa was one of the merchant princes of Antwerp, who is\r\nsupposed to have lived in the fifteenth century. His only children\r\nwere two daughters, whom he had married to young noblemen. Not content\r\nwith the handsome dowries he had given them on their marriage, and\r\ntoo impatient to wait for the time when all his vast wealth would\r\nbecome theirs by inheritance, they persuaded him to make it over to\r\nthem during his life-time. For a short period he was treated with due\r\nconsideration, but it was not long before he began to find that his\r\npresence in the houses of his sons-in-law was irksome to them and their\r\nwives; and at last he was plainly told that he must not expect any\r\nlonger to find a home with them. Under these circumstances he hired a\r\nsmall residence, and turned over in his mind how he could manage so as\r\nto recover the position in his daughters’ houses which he had formerly\r\noccupied. At last he hit on this expedient. He invited his sons-in-law\r\nand their wives to dine with him on a certain day, and, when he was\r\nquite sure they would come, he went to an old friend, a rich merchant,\r\nand borrowed from him the sum of one thousand crowns for twenty-four\r\nhours, telling him to keep the transaction a profound secret, but to\r\nsend a servant to his house the next day at a certain hour to fetch it\r\nback. Accordingly, the next day, when his daughters and their husbands\r\nwere seated at his table, a message came that his friend had sent for\r\nthe sum of money he had promised. He pretended to be displeased at\r\nbeing interrupted in the midst of his meal, but left the table, went\r\ninto an adjoining apartment, and returned with a sack of money, from\r\nwhich he counted out the full sum of a thousand crowns, and delivered\r\nit to the messenger. The astonishment of his guests, who were not\r\naware of how the money had come into his possession, was extreme,\r\nand, believing him to be still the owner of unbounded wealth, his\r\nsons-in-law insisted on his taking up his abode with them alternately\r\nfor the rest of his days. Each vied with the other in showing him every\r\nattention, hoping thus to secure the greater share of the inheritance.\r\nHe always brought with him a heavy strong box with three locks, which\r\nwas supposed to contain untold wealth. At last, the time when he was\r\nto quit this world arrived, and on his death-bed he sent for his two\r\nsons-in-law and the Prior of a neighbouring Convent of Jacobins, and\r\ndelivered to them the three keys of the box, which, he said, contained\r\nhis will, but with strict injunctions that it was not to be opened till\r\nforty days after his funeral had elapsed. Wishing, however, as he said,\r\nto do good while he was yet alive, he begged his sons-in-law to advance\r\na large sum for immediate distribution among the poor, and also to pay\r\nanother large sum to the Prior to secure the prayers of the Church for\r\nhis soul. This was done willingly, in anticipation of the expected rich\r\ninheritance, and the old man was sumptuously buried. At the expiration\r\nof the forty days the box was opened with due formality, and was found\r\nto contain a heap of old iron, lead, and stones, on the top of which\r\nwas a large cudgel, with a parchment rolled round it, on which was\r\nwritten the will in these terms:--“_Ego Johannes Connaxa tale condo\r\ntestamentum, at qui sui curâ relictâ, alterius curam susceperit,\r\nmactetur hâc clavâ_.”\r\n\r\n[221] From Rachel Du Port.\r\n\r\n[222]\r\n\r\n    “He that gives away all\r\n    Before he is dead,\r\n    Let ’em take this hatchet\r\n    And knock him on ye head.”\r\n\r\n_Notes and Queries_, IV.

This object, we may suppose, was to a\r\ncertain extent gained, but, like the monkey who had seen the world,\r\nmany of these youths returned to their native isle with an inflated\r\nidea of their own consequence, and affecting to despise and ignore all\r\nthat had been familiar to them from their earliest childhood.\r\n\r\nIt is said of one of these young men, that, after a residence of\r\nno long duration in England, he pretended, on his return, to have\r\ncompletely forgotten the names of some of the most common farming\r\nimplements, and, indeed, to have almost lost the use of his mother\r\ntongue. His father was in despair, for it was evident that if the boy\r\ncould not converse with the labourers, he would be of little or no\r\nassistance in directing the farming operations. A lucky accident set\r\nthe father’s mind at rest on this score. His son, in passing through\r\nthe farmyard, put his foot on a rake that was lying on the ground,\r\npartly hidden by some straw. The handle flew up and hit him a smart\r\nblow on the forehead, upon which, forgetting his pretended ignorance,\r\nhe exclaimed, in good Guernsey-French, “_Au Guyablle seit le râté_,”\r\n(“Devil take the rake.”) His father, who was standing by, congratulated\r\nhim on the miraculous recovery of his memory, and begged him henceforth\r\nnot to forget “_sen râté_.” The proverbial saying “_Il n’a pas\r\nroublliaï sen râté_,” (“He has not forgotten his rake,”) is still\r\napplied to a person who remembers what he learned in his youth.[223]\r\n\r\n[223] See a story precisely similar in its incidents in that curious\r\ncollection MacTaggart’s _Scottish Gallovidian Encyclopædia_, under the\r\nword “Claut.” The story must be an ancient one, to be told in places\r\nso far apart as Galloway and Guernsey, and speaking totally different\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE COTILLON DE RACHÉ CATEL.\r\n\r\nThe evils that may result from being over particular, and the wisdom of\r\nletting well alone, are exemplified by the story of Rachel Câtel and\r\nher petticoat. This respectable matron or spinster--for tradition gives\r\nus no clue to her state in life--was engaged in fashioning a petticoat.\r\nShe cut it out, and found it somewhat too long. She cut again, and now\r\nit was too short. When, therefore, a thing has been spoilt by too much\r\ncare or meddling, old people will shake their heads and say:--“_Ch’est\r\ncoum le cotillon de Râché Câtel. A’ le copit et il était trop long. A’\r\nle copit derechef, et il était trop court._”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAT AND THE FOX. A FABLE.\r\n\r\nOne day a cat and a fox were travelling together and chatting of one\r\nthing and another as they jogged on their way.\r\n\r\nAt last says the cat to the fox:\r\n\r\n“You are always talking of your cleverness. How many cunning devices\r\nhave you to escape from your numerous enemies?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” answered the fox, “_j’en ai une pouquie_, (I carry a whole sack\r\nfull,) but you, Mistress Puss, pray tell me, how many have you?”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” replied the cat, “I can boast but of one.”\r\n\r\nShortly after this conversation they saw a large fierce-looking dog\r\nadvancing towards them. It was but the affair of a minute for puss to\r\nclimb into the nearest tree and hide herself among the branches, while\r\nReynard took refuge in the entrance of a drain that was close at hand.\r\n\r\nUnluckily the drain narrowed so suddenly that his body only was\r\nconcealed, and his long bushy tail was left exposed. The dog seized on\r\nthis, and caused poor Reynard to cry out pitifully for help. Puss, from\r\nher safe retreat among the branches, looked down, and called out to her\r\nunfortunate companion:\r\n\r\n“Now’s the time to make use of your many devices, _délie donc ta\r\npouque_!” (“Why don’t you untie your sack?”)[224]\r\n\r\n[224] From John Rougier, Esq.\r\n\r\nSee also _Revue des Traditions Populaires_, Vol. I., p. 201.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FARM SERVANT AND THE WEEDS.\r\n\r\nThe Guernsey workman is industrious and thrifty, working hard when\r\nit is on his own account, but apt to be slow and disinclined to do\r\nmore work than what is absolutely necessary to save his credit, when\r\nemployed by others. There is a certain amount of calculation in this.\r\nIdleness or laziness are not the only motives. He knows that so long as\r\nthe job in hand lasts, he will be paid his day’s wages, and therefore\r\nhe is not in a hurry to get it finished. His calculations go even a\r\nlittle beyond this; for a master workman to whom an indifferent person\r\nmade the remark that the work he was executing was not of a quality\r\nto last many years, made the ingenuous reply, “Do you suppose I would\r\nwillingly take the bread out of my children’s mouths?” implying that if\r\nthe work were done in too substantial or durable a manner, there would\r\nbe nothing left for those who were to come after him to gain their\r\nliving by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Mill, Talbots.]\r\n\r\nA good story is told among the country people, of a farm labourer,\r\nwho, when put to clear out the weeds from a field, was observed always\r\nto leave some of the most thriving standing. One day his master\r\nremonstrated with him, and got for answer, “Weeds are bread.” No reply\r\nwas made at the moment, but when meal-time came, and the soup was\r\nserved out, a bowl full of weeds was handed to the workman with the\r\nremark:--“Since weeds are bread, eat that, for you get no more to-day.”\r\nIt is said that the lesson was understood, and that for the future\r\nthe farm servant performed his allotted task in a more conscientious\r\nway.[225]\r\n\r\n[225] From George Allez, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nHistorical Reminiscences.\r\n\r\n    “Antiquities, or remnants of history, are, as was said,\r\n    _tanquam tabula naufragii_, when industrious persons, by\r\n    an exact and scrupulous diligence and observation, out of\r\n    monuments, names, words, proverbs, traditions, private records\r\n    and evidences, fragments of stories, passages of books that\r\n    concern not story, and the like, do save and recover somewhat\r\n    from the deluge of time.”--Bacon’s _Advancement of Learning_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCADWALLA AND BRIAN.\r\n\r\nAlthough the following story is entirely forgotten in Guernsey, and\r\nindeed may possibly never have been popularly known in the island, it\r\nis entitled, from its legendary and romantic character, to a place in\r\nthis collection. It is related by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his British\r\nHistory, Book XII. Ch. 4.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to premise that Edwin, the first of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nKings who embraced Christianity, having quarrelled with Cadwalla,\r\nSovereign of North Wales, attacked and defeated him at Widdington,\r\nnear Morpeth. Edwin pursued Cadwalla into Wales, and chased him into\r\nIreland. These events happened about the year 630 A.D. The story itself\r\nshall be told in the words employed by Geoffrey in his account of\r\nCadwalla’s exile, as we find them translated in Bohn’s “Antiquarian\r\nLibrary.”\r\n\r\n“Cadwalla, not knowing what course to take, was almost in despair of\r\never returning. At last it came into his head to go to Salomon, King\r\nof the Armorican Britons, and desire his assistance and advice, to\r\nenable him to return to his kingdom. And so, as he was steering towards\r\nArmorica, a strong tempest rose on a sudden, which dispersed the ships\r\nof his companions, and in a short time left no two of them together.\r\nThe pilot of the King’s ship was seized immediately with so great a\r\nfear, that, quitting the stern, he left the vessel to the disposal of\r\nfortune, so that all night it was tossed up and down in great danger\r\nby the raging waves. The next morning they arrived at a certain island\r\ncalled _Garnareia_,[226] where, with great difficulty, they got ashore.\r\nCadwalla was forthwith seized with such grief for the loss of his\r\ncompanions, that, for three days and nights together, he refused to\r\neat, but lay sick upon his bed. The fourth day he was taken with a very\r\ngreat longing for some venison, and, causing Brian (his nephew) to be\r\ncalled, made him acquainted with it. Whereupon Brian took his bow and\r\nquiver, and went through the island, that if he could light on any\r\nwild beast, he might make booty of it. And when he had walked over the\r\nwhole island without finding what he was in quest of, he was extremely\r\nconcerned that he could not gratify his master’s desire, and was afraid\r\nhis sickness would prove mortal if his longing were not satisfied. He,\r\ntherefore, fell upon a new device, and cut a piece of flesh out of his\r\nown thigh, which he roasted upon a spit, and carried to the King for\r\nvenison. The King, thinking it to be real venison, began to eat of\r\nit to his great refreshment, admiring the sweetness of it, which he\r\nfancied exceeded any flesh he had ever tasted before. At last, when\r\nhe had fully satisfied his appetite, he became more cheerful, and in\r\nthree days was perfectly well again. Then, the wind standing fair, he\r\ngot ready his ship, and, hoisting sails, they pursued their voyage\r\nand arrived at the city Kidaleta (St. Malo). From thence they went to\r\nKing Salomon, by whom they were received kindly and with all suitable\r\nrespect; and, as soon as he had learned the occasion of their coming,\r\nhe made them a promise of assistance.”\r\n\r\nThe chronicler subsequently relates how Brian killed the second-sighted\r\nmagician of Edwin. Cadwalla returned to Britain, and, with the aid of\r\nthe Saxon Penda, King of Mercia, conquered and killed Edwin. He was\r\nafterwards triumphant in fourteen great battles and sixty skirmishes\r\nwith the Angles, but finally perished, with the flower of his army, in\r\nbattle with Oswald, ruler of the Saxon kingdom of Bernicia.\r\n\r\n[226] As some readers may be unable to detect “Guernsey” in\r\n“_Garnareia_,” it may be as well to state that “_Ghernerhuia_,”\r\n“_Gerneria_,” “_Guernnerui_,” and “_Gernereye_,” are all names given\r\nto the island in ancient documents. The last indeed is found on the\r\nancient seal of the bailiwick.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUKE RICHARD OF NORMANDY AND THE DEMON.\r\n\r\nAs the inhabitants of Guernsey may be presumed to be better acquainted\r\nwith the chronicles of their own Duchy of Normandy than with those of\r\nthe ancient Britons, it is not improbable that the following legendary\r\ntale, related of Duke Richard, surnamed “Sans Peur,” may be known to\r\nsome of them. The _Chronique de Normandie_, printed at Rouen in 1576,\r\ngives it in words of which the following is a close translation:--\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time, as Duke Richard was riding from one of his castles\r\nto a manor, where a very beautiful lady was residing, the Devil\r\nattacked him, and Richard fought with, and vanquished him. After this\r\nadventure, the Devil disguised himself as a beautiful maiden richly\r\nadorned, and appeared to him in a boat at Granville, where Richard then\r\nwas. Richard entered into the boat to converse with, and contemplate\r\nthe beauty of, this lady, and the Devil carried away the said Duke\r\nRichard to a rock in the sea in the island of Guernsey, where he was\r\nfound.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the marks of cloven feet, which have been found deeply\r\nimprinted in the granite[227] in more than one spot in the island, may\r\nbe attributed to this visit.\r\n\r\n[227] The stone at Jerbourg, which is said to bear the mark left by the\r\nDevil’s claw, stands in a hedge on the right hand side of the road,\r\nwhere the rise towards Doyle’s column begins. It is a large mass of\r\nwhite quartz, and has the black mark of the Devil’s claw imprinted on\r\nit.--_From J. Richardson Tardif, Esq._\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHBISHOP MAUGER.\r\n\r\nIf the two legendary tales, which we have just related, are unknown to\r\nthe present generation, it is not so with the well-authenticated fact\r\nof the temporary residence in Guernsey of that turbulent ecclesiastic,\r\nMauger, Archbishop of Rouen, uncle of William the Conqueror.\r\n\r\nAll the Norman chroniclers agree in telling us that, although the\r\nPope had granted a dispensation, this audacious prelate ventured to\r\nexcommunicate his Sovereign for having contracted a marriage with\r\nMatilda, daughter of the Count of Flanders, an alliance within the\r\ndegrees of affinity prohibited by the Church. Mauger’s insolence did\r\nnot remain unpunished. The Pope sent a Legate to Normandy, the bishops\r\nof the province were assembled, and his treason to his Sovereign, and\r\ncontempt of the Papal authority, were punished by his deposition from\r\nhis archiepiscopal throne, and banishment to the island of Guernsey.\r\nSome historians assign, as a further reason for his disgrace, the\r\nimmorality of his life, and his prodigal expenditure, which led him,\r\nnot only to waste the revenues of the Church, but even to sell the\r\nconsecrated vessels, and the ornaments of the sanctuary.\r\n\r\nTradition points out the spot in the neighbourhood of that romantic\r\nlittle creek, known by the anglicised name of Saints’ Bay, but which,\r\nin ancient documents, is called “_La Contrée de Seing_,” where the\r\ndeposed prelate lived during his enforced sojourn in Guernsey. Here,\r\nit is said, he became acquainted with a noble damsel named _Gille_,\r\nby whom he had several children, one of whom, Michael de Bayeux,\r\naccompanied Bohemond of Austria to Palestine, and distinguished himself\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\nCommon report accused Mauger of being addicted to magical arts, and of\r\nhaving intercourse with a familiar spirit called “_Thoret_,” a name\r\nwhich brings to mind the thunderer _Thor_, one of the principal deities\r\nof his Scandinavian ancestors. By means of this imp, it was believed,\r\nhe had the faculty of predicting future events.\r\n\r\nHaving embarked one day, with the design of reaching the coast of\r\nNormandy, and having arrived at St. Vaast, he addressed the master of\r\nthe ship in these words:--“I know for certain that one of us two will\r\nthis day be drowned; let us land.” The master paid no attention to what\r\nwas said, but continued his course. It was summer, the weather was\r\nextremely hot, and the Archbishop was attired in very loose raiment.\r\nThe vessel struck, Mauger endeavoured to leave the ship, but, becoming\r\nentangled in his garments, fell into the sea, and was drowned before\r\nany assistance could be given. When the tide retired, search was made\r\nfor the body, and it was found wedged in between two rocks, in an\r\nupright position. The sailors carried it to Cherbourg, where it was\r\nburied.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the prelate might have been entirely forgotten\r\nin the place of his exile, had it not been that a very numerous\r\nfamily, bearing his name, still exists in the island, and claims to\r\nbe descended from him. No name indeed is more common in the parish\r\nof St. Martin de la Belleuse, and especially in the neighbourhood of\r\nSaint, than that of Mauger. An authentic document, the “Extent” of\r\nEdward III., proves that a family of this name held land in this parish\r\nin 1331.[228] All who bear the name, even in the humblest ranks of\r\nsociety, have heard of the Archbishop, and pride themselves in their\r\nsupposed descent from him. Nor is this belief confined to Guernsey, for\r\nin Jersey also, where a branch of the family has long existed, the same\r\nidea prevails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ivy Castle.]\r\n\r\nThere is also extant an imperfect pedigree of the house of Mauger,\r\nof Jobourg, near Cape La Hague, in Normandy, which connects them\r\nwith the insular family, but endeavours to get rid of the stigma of\r\nillegitimacy, which would attach to the progeny of an ecclesiastic, by\r\nthe invention of an imaginary brother, who accompanied Mauger in his\r\nbanishment, and from whom, and not from the Archbishop, they pretend\r\nto deduce their descent. The family of Guille, long established in\r\nthe island of Guernsey, and in the parish of St. Martin’s, claims the\r\nquestionable honour of having produced the fair Gille, whose charms\r\ncaptivated the unscrupulous prelate.\r\n\r\nThere is one fact, however, of which the family of Mauger, of Guernsey,\r\nhas just cause to be proud, and that is the daring and successful\r\nexploit of one of them in the service of the descendant of their\r\nancient Dukes. An extract from a manuscript register of the Cathedral\r\nof Coutances, said to be preserved in the British Museum, tells us how,\r\non Midsummer Night, in the year of grace 1419, Jacques Mauger arrived\r\nfrom Guernsey with his men, at the port of Agon, at the entrance of\r\nthe river, and took by escalade the fortress of Mont Martin, near\r\nCoutances, and how Henry V., King of England, then in possession of\r\nthe greater part of Normandy, rewarded the gallant act by a gift of\r\nthe Seigneurie of Bosques, and the permission to bear henceforth on\r\nhis shield the cross of the blessed knight of St. George, in a field\r\nargent, with his own paternal arms, two chevrons sable, in the first\r\nand fourth quarters, and, in the second and third the arms of Bosques,\r\na lion rampant, also sable.\r\n\r\nIt may not be uninteresting to some to know that the Hampshire and\r\nIsle of Wight family of Major were originally Maugers from one of the\r\nChannel Islands, and that Richard Cromwell, son of the Protector,\r\nmarried one of them.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to give here a copy of the pedigree of Mauger, of\r\nJobourg, in Normandy.\r\n\r\n“Extrait de la Généalogie de la Famille du Mauger à Jobourg en\r\nNormandie au Cap La Hague.\r\n\r\n“Le Duc de Normandie, nommé Guillaume le Conquérant, éleva son cousin\r\nd’Evreux, nommé Mauger, à l’Archevêché de Rouen en la troisième\r\nannée de son règne en Normandie. Le Seigneur Archevêque, menant une\r\nvie non conforme à sa dignité, attira sur lui la haine du Duc, son\r\nbienfaiteur, qui le fit reléguer a l’île de Greneseye; il prit terre\r\nen ce lieu avec son frère Gautier Mauger, sur la côte et paroisse de\r\nSt. Martin, et après avoir passé quelques années en ce lieu il péri\r\nau ras de Bartleur, après avoir prédit sa mort. Son frère Gautier eut\r\nplusieurs fils naturels, dont deux nommés Léopold et Théodore: Léopold\r\népousa Pauline de Carteret, fille et seule héritière de Samuel de\r\nCarteret, Ecuyer, Seigneur du Castel, et Théodore ne maria point, et\r\nlaissa deux fils et une fille naturels, l’un nommé Paul, l’autre nommé\r\nRodolphe, et la fille nommée Cléotilde. Les deux fils furent mariés;\r\nl’un épousa Sandirez Lampeirier ou Lampereur de Jersey, et Rodolphe\r\népousa Marie Careye de Greneseye. Paul eut plusieurs fils, dont deux\r\nnommé Alexandre et Gautier, comme son premier père, lequel fut chassé\r\nde l’île de Jersey, avec deux des fils de Rodolphe qu’il avait eus de\r\nMarie Careye; les autres enfans sortis de Rodolphe furent à Greneseye,\r\ndemeurant sur l’héritage de leur mère en l’année 1399. Gautier fit\r\nplusieurs acquêts à Jobourg à la Hague, où il établit sa demeure, après\r\navoir quitté Jersey, et fut marié à une des filles de Pierre de Mary,\r\nSeigneur de Jobourg, en l’année 1418. Gautier engendra Toussaint et\r\nJacques, le dernier repassa à Greneseye pour prendre possession d’un\r\nhéritage par succession, et Toussaint resta à Jobourg; de Toussaint\r\nnaquit Fabien; de Fabien naquit Chaille; et Chaille engendra Pierre; de\r\nPierre Chaille, qui vivoit encore en 1570; à l’egard de Léopold, qui\r\navait epousé Pauline de Carteret, nous n’avons point, pour le present,\r\nde connaissance de sa généalogie.\r\n\r\n“Les Armoiries des Mauger (descendant de Guillaume le Conquérant, Duc\r\nde Normandie) sont une ancre et des roses au dessus du dit ancre. Tiré\r\nde la Heraudrie, et approuvé du dit Duc.”[229]\r\n\r\n[228] EDITOR’S NOTE.--And at the Assizes held in Guernsey in 1319, a\r\n“Rauf Mauger” appears among the landowners of St. Martin’s parish.\r\nThe same name--“Rauf Mauger”--appears in the Extent of 1331; “Richard\r\nMauger” in a Perchage of Blanchelande, (undated, but made before 1364).\r\nIn 1364 another “Rauf Mauger” appears among the Jurymen of St. Martin’s\r\nsummoned to adjudicate on the rights of the Abbot of Blanchelande; and\r\na Richard Mauger, of St. Martin’s parish, is mentioned in the “Bille de\r\nPartage” of Denis Le Marchant in 1393.\r\n\r\n[229] EDITOR’S NOTE.--The obvious inaccuracy of this pedigree can be\r\njudged by only nine generations being given to supply the interval\r\nof 515 years, 1055-1570. Thirty-three and a quarter years are\r\ngenerally allowed for a generation, so that to give any appearance of\r\nprobability, at least sixteen generations would have to be accounted\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALLAD OF IVON DE GALLES.\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of printing, oral tradition was almost the\r\nonly way in which the people--generally ignorant of writing or\r\nreading--could transmit the recollection of facts and circumstances\r\nwhich they deemed worthy of being remembered; and it was soon\r\ndiscovered that versification afforded a very strong aid to memory.\r\nHence arose that species of metrical tale which we call a ballad.\r\nThese ballads, passing from mouth to mouth, soon became corrupted.\r\nWhole verses were sometimes omitted, by which the thread of the story\r\nwas lost or rendered obscure, and others were supplied by borrowing\r\nfrom the work of another bard, or by the invention of the reciter.\r\nNevertheless, in the historical ballads, facts and details were often\r\npreserved which had escaped the notice of the more regular chroniclers.\r\n\r\nWhether, in former days, Guernsey could boast of any number of these\r\nmetrical histories, it is now impossible to say. Unless we include\r\nin this category, a sort of “complainte,” written in 1552 by the\r\nRoman Catholic priests, whom the progress of the doctrines of the\r\nReformation had driven out of their cures, the ballad of “_Ivon de\r\nGalles, ou la descente des Aragousais_,” is the only one which has come\r\ndown to us.[230] Many copies of it have been preserved, differing but\r\nslightly from each other in the main, although there are one or two\r\nverbal differences of some importance. Most of the copies conclude with\r\nthe twentieth verse, but some have a second part, consisting of six\r\nstanzas, and purporting to give an account of Ivon’s adventures after\r\nhe left Guernsey, and the subsequent melancholy fate of himself and his\r\nfleet. As this account is quite different from what has come down to\r\nus in history, it is probably the work of some later bard, who wished\r\nto make the story more complete than he found it, and by a sort of\r\npoetical justice to punish Ivon and his followers for the evil they had\r\ninflicted on the island.\r\n\r\nThe ballad agrees in the main with the account of the invasion as given\r\nby Froissart and Holinshed. The adventures in the second part probably\r\nrelate to some other of the numerous descents on the island during\r\nthe reign of Edward III., perhaps to that by Bahuchet, a French naval\r\ncommander, about the year 1338. This Bahuchet landed in England, and\r\ncommitted great atrocities at Portsmouth and Southampton, for which,\r\nwhen he was taken prisoner in the great engagement off Sluys, in 1340,\r\nEdward ordered him to be hanged at the main-yard.\r\n\r\nFrom Froissart’s _Chronicles_ we learn that Ivon, or as he calls him,\r\nYvain de Galles, was the son of a Prince of Wales whom Edward III. had\r\nput to death, and whose possessions he had seized upon. Ivon, thus\r\ndisinherited, took refuge in France, where he entered into the service\r\nof the King, Charles V., and was by him entrusted with the command\r\nof ships and three thousand men. It appears from another part of the\r\nChronicle, that Henry of Trastamara, King of Castille and Aragon, had\r\nsupplied his ally, Charles, with a large fleet, well armed and manned,\r\nand it is probable that the galleys which Ivon commanded formed part of\r\nthis fleet. If so, the name of “Aragousais,” or men of Aragon, given in\r\nthe ballad to the invading force, is accounted for. With these troops\r\nhe sailed from Harfleur and reached Guernsey.\r\n\r\nAymon, or Edmund, Rose, esquire of honour to the King of England, and\r\nGovernor of the island, advanced to meet him with all the force he\r\ncould muster,--about eight hundred men. The battle was long and hotly\r\ncontested, but ended in the discomfiture of the insular force, with\r\nthe loss of four hundred of their men, and in the retreat of Aymon\r\nRose into Castle Cornet, to which Ivon laid siege. Several assaults\r\nwere made on the Castle, but, as it was strongly fortified and well\r\nprovisioned, they were not attended with success. How long the siege\r\nlasted we are not informed, but the French King, requiring the services\r\nof Ivon elsewhere, and believing Castle Cornet to be impregnable, sent\r\norders for the siege to be raised. A few years afterwards, Ivon lost\r\nhis life by the dagger of an assassin of his own nation, a Welshman of\r\nthe name of Lambe, apparently at the instigation of Richard II.\r\n\r\nAccording to the ballad, Ivon landed his troops early on a Tuesday\r\nmorning in Vazon Bay. A countryman, who had risen early to look after\r\nhis sheep, perceived the invaders and gave the alarm, upon which all\r\nthe inhabitants assembled and endeavoured to repel them, but without\r\nsuccess. A stand was at last made on the hill above the town of St.\r\nPeter Port, and a sanguinary engagement took place, in which five\r\nhundred and one of both sides were killed.\r\n\r\nTradition points to a spot near Elizabeth College as the scene of\r\nthis encounter, and the locality to this day bears the name of “_La\r\nBataille_.”\r\n\r\nA deep lane, which formerly passed to the eastward of the strangers’\r\nburial ground, but which has been long filled up and enclosed within\r\nthe walls of the cemetery, was said to owe its name of “_La Ruette\r\nMeurtrière_” to the same event.\r\n\r\nTowards the evening, eighty English merchants,--probably the crews\r\nof some trading vessels--arrived, and lent their assistance to the\r\nislanders. By means of this reinforcement the enemy was prevented from\r\npenetrating into the town, but they reached the shore, and, the tide\r\nbeing low, crossed over to Castle Cornet, and attacked it.\r\n\r\nMost of the copies of the ballad say that they took the Castle, “_par\r\nforce prindrent le Chasteau_,” but one, which has been preserved in\r\nthe registers of the parish of St. Saviour, where it is inserted\r\nabout the year 1638, has these words--“_Il vouloient prendre le\r\nChasteau_,”--which seem to agree better with the other statements in\r\nthe ballad that Ivon’s ships came round the island by the southward,\r\nthat they received some damage from the peasantry at La Corbière, and\r\nthat they re-embarked their troops at Bec de la Chèvre, now known by\r\nthe name of the Terres point, after which Ivon ordered them to make\r\nsail for St. Sampson’s Harbour.\r\n\r\nHere they landed. Negotiations were entered on with Brégart, the Prior\r\nor Commissary of St. Michel du Valle, a dependency of the famous Abbey\r\nof Mont St. Michel in Normandy, and Ivon laid siege to the Vale Castle,\r\nwhither Aymon Rose, the Governor of the island, whom we hear of for the\r\nfirst time, had retreated and entrenched himself.\r\n\r\nSummoned by Ivon to surrender, he refused, but agreed to sanction an\r\narrangement which Brégart had made with the people, and which seems\r\nto have had for object to buy off the invaders by payment of a sum of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThe ballad assigns this as the origin of the charge on land called\r\n“champart,” but it is certain that this species of tithe existed long\r\nbefore this time.\r\n\r\nMost of the copies end here, but some have a second part, of which we\r\nhave already spoken, and which was probably written at a later period.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to account for the discrepancy between the local\r\naccount and that of Froissart and others as to the name of the Castle\r\ninto which the Governor, Aymon Rose, retired, unless by the supposition\r\nthat the historians knew Castle Cornet by name as a fortress deemed\r\nimpregnable, and assumed, without further inquiry, that it must be the\r\none in which the Governor entrenched himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Houses formerly facing West Door of Town Church.]\r\n\r\nAn event of so much importance was well calculated to make a lasting\r\nimpression on the people. And to this day “_Les Aragousais_” are\r\nspoken of, and various traditions relating to them are repeated. It is\r\nsingular, however, to find that with the lapse of time they have come\r\nto be looked upon as a supernatural race--in fact, to be confounded\r\nwith the fairies. The form which this traditional remembrance of them\r\nhas taken will be found on page 204, and tends in some degree to\r\nconfirm the idea entertained by some writers on fairy mythology that\r\nmany of the tales related of those fantastic beings may be accounted\r\nfor by the theory that they refer to an earlier race of men, gradually\r\ndriven out by tribes more advanced in civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe places called “_La Bataille_[231]” and “_La Ruette Meurtrière_”\r\nhave already been mentioned as the spots where the great battle took\r\nplace. The “_Rouge Rue_,” leading down the hill to the westward of St.\r\nJohn’s Church, is said to derive its name from the blood spilt on this\r\noccasion. If this really be the origin of the name, we may suppose\r\nthat the islanders, retreating towards the Vale Castle, or perhaps the\r\nChâteau des Marais, were overtaken there, and that a second engagement\r\ntook place. But there is reason to believe that the tradition relates\r\nto another locality in quite a different direction, which in times gone\r\nby bore also the name of “_La Rouge Rue_,” but which has long ceased\r\nto be so called. We speak of the upper part of Hauteville, sloping\r\nsouthwards towards the valley of Havelet. According to the late Miss\r\nLauga, who died at the advanced age of eighty-five, her mother, who had\r\ninherited from her ancestors property in this neighbourhood, always\r\nspoke of it as “_La Rouge Rue_,” and said that a sanguinary battle\r\nhad been fought in ancient days on this spot. And, indeed, this name\r\nappears in the old contracts and title-deeds, by which property in\r\nthe neighbourhood is held. The consequence of its having ceased to be\r\nknown popularly by its ancient appellation would naturally be that\r\nthe traditionary tale of the name being derived from the blood spilt\r\nthere would be transferred to another and better known locality, which\r\nchanced--perhaps simply from the colour of the soil--to bear the same\r\nname.\r\n\r\nFirearms were of such recent invention that it is scarcely to be\r\nsupposed that any had as yet found their way to Guernsey. If, however,\r\nany faith can be placed in tradition, their use and construction were\r\nnot totally unknown in the island, for it is said that the trunk of a\r\ntree was hollowed out and bound round with iron hoops, but that when\r\nthis deadly weapon was loaded, no one could be found bold enough to\r\nfire it, until a child, ignorant of the risk he was incurring, was\r\ninduced, by the promise of a cake, to perform the dangerous feat.\r\n\r\nIt is also said that the women of the island contributed all their\r\near-rings and other jewels to buy off the invaders; and it was very\r\ngenerally believed that a peculiar breed of small but strong and\r\nspirited horses--now unfortunately extinct--was derived from those that\r\nhad escaped during the battle, and so had remained in the island after\r\nthe Spaniards left.\r\n\r\nThe tradition, which confounds Ivon’s forces with the fairies, relates\r\nhow all the islanders were killed, except a man and a boy of St.\r\nAndrew’s parish, who concealed themselves in an oven, over the mouth of\r\nwhich a woman spread her black petticoat, and so escaped; and how the\r\nconquerors, who are described as a very diminutive race, married the\r\nwidows and maidens, and so re-peopled the island. The small stature\r\nand dark complexion of some families are occasionally appealed to as\r\nproofs of this origin.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this tradition may be an indistinct recollection of a far\r\nearlier invasion and possession of the island by some of the piratical\r\nhordes from the North, that began to infest the coasts of the Channel\r\nas early as the beginning of the fifth century. These were not unlikely\r\nto have subjugated the men of the island, and to have taken forcible\r\npossession of their wives, and any tradition of the event might very\r\nnaturally be transferred from one invasion to another, and come finally\r\nto be fixed on the last and best known.\r\n\r\nThe ballad, of which an English translation is attempted, has\r\nevidently suffered much from the defective memory of reciters, and\r\nthe carelessness of transcribers, so that some of the stanzas appear\r\nto be almost hopelessly corrupt. The main incidents of the story\r\nare, however, tolerably well defined. It seems to have been composed\r\noriginally in French, and not in the Norman dialect used in the island.\r\nThe stanzas consist of the unusual number of seven lines, of which\r\nthe first and third rhyme together, and the second, fourth, fifth and\r\nsixth--the seventh rhyming occasionally with the first and third,\r\nbut more frequently standing alone. In some verses assonances take\r\nthe place of more perfect rhymes, which may be adduced as a proof of\r\nthe antiquity of the ballad. Perhaps it would not be impossible, by\r\ncomparing the various copies, choosing the readings which appear least\r\ncorrupt, altering here and there the position of a line in the stanza,\r\nor the arrangement of the words that compose it, or even sometimes\r\nchanging a word where the exigencies of the rhyme seem to require it,\r\nto produce a copy that would offend less against the rules of prosody;\r\nbut this is a process which would require great care, and which respect\r\nfor antiquity forbids us to attempt.\r\n\r\nWe must take the ballad, with all its faults and imperfections, as we\r\nfind it.\r\n\r\nEVAN OF WALES, OR THE INVASION OF GUERNSEY IN 1372.\r\n\r\n_Part the First._\r\n\r\n    I.\r\n\r\n    Draw near and listen, great and small,\r\n      Of high and low degree,\r\n

morn at break of day,\r\n        To land these troops in Vazon Bay,\r\n      He bade his ships advance.\r\n\r\n    III.\r\n\r\n    At early dawn from quiet sleep\r\n      John Letoc rose that day,\r\n    To tend his little flock of sheep\r\n      He took his lonely way,\r\n        When lo! upon the Vazon sands\r\n        He saw, drawn up in warlike bands\r\n      The foe in fierce array.\r\n\r\n    IV.\r\n\r\n    A horse he met upon his way\r\n      Trotting along the road,\r\n    Strayed from the camp--without delay\r\n      The charger he bestrode,\r\n        And soon from house to house the alarm\r\n        He gave, crying out “to arms, quick, arm!”\r\n      Through all the isle he rode.\r\n\r\n    V.\r\n\r\n    “To arms, to arms, my merry men all,\r\n      To arms, for we must

He won a garter gay, I ween,\r\n        ’Twas neither silk nor velvet sheen,\r\n      Though crimson was the band.\r\n\r\n    VII.\r\n\r\n    For near the mill at La Carrière,\r\n      With halbert

    Then suddenly their course they steer\r\n        Towards Saint Sampson’s port, and there\r\n      They land in angry mood.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Old Cottage, Fermain.]\r\n\r\n    XVI.\r\n\r\n

jewels rare\r\n      To win her to his side.\r\n        At Granville, in the pleasant land\r\n        Of France, Sir Evan sought her hand,\r\n      Nor was his suit denied.\r\n\r\n    XVIII.\r\n\r\n    Near the Archangel’s Castle then,\r\n      Upon a rising ground,\r\n    Sir Evan camped--our countrymen\r\n      Sure refuge there had found.\r\n        Brégard, in hopes to increase his store,\r\n        Advances to the Castle door\r\n      And bade a parley sound.\r\n\r\n    XIX.\r\n\r\n    He counselled them to yield forthwith,\r\n      But brave Sir Edmund Rose\r\n    Declared he’d sooner meet his death\r\n      Than bend to foreign foes,\r\n        But to the Abbot should they yield\r\n        A double tithe on every field,\r\n      He would it not oppose.\r\n\r\n    XX.\r\n\r\n    The Abbot to Sir Evan went,\r\n      And soon a bargain closed;\r\n    The simple peasants gave assent\r\n      To all the monk proposed,\r\n        And bound their lands a sheaf to pay,\r\n        Beyond the tithes, and thus, they say,\r\n      The Champart was imposed.\r\n\r\n    _Part the Second._\r\n\r\n    I.\r\n\r\n    With spoils and presents not a few\r\n      Sir Evan sailed once more\r\n    Tow’rds le Conquet, his ships with new\r\n      Supplies of food to store;\r\n        Before Belleisle (so goes the tale)\r\n        They burnt a fleet of thirty sail,\r\n      The crews being gone on shore.\r\n\r\n    II.\r\n\r\n    The south wind rose, and on the coasts\r\n      Of Brittany they passed,\r\n    An English fleet to stop their boasts\r\n      Appeared in sight at last:\r\n        Full sixty men a footing found\r\n        On board Sir Evan’s bark, and bound\r\n      His crew in fetters fast.\r\n\r\n    III.\r\n\r\n    Sir Evan to the mast they tied,\r\n      And then before his face\r\n    Insult his young and beauteous bride\r\n      And load her with disgrace;\r\n        They take him to Southampton town\r\n        And on his head, in guise of crown,\r\n      A red-hot morion place.\r\n\r\n    IV.\r\n\r\n    They dragged his men out one by one,\r\n      And hung them up in chains,\r\n    And now not one of all the crew\r\n      Save Eleanor remains.\r\n        A beggar’s scrip her only store,\r\n        She roams about from door to door,\r\n      And scarce a living gains.\r\n\r\n    V.\r\n\r\n    How fared the rest of Evan’s fleet?\r\n      Methinks I hear you say,\r\n    When raging winds for ever beat\r\n      The strongest towers decay;\r\n        To bend these ships before the breeze,\r\n        And sinking ’neath the briny seas,\r\n      In vain for mercy pray.\r\n\r\n    VI.\r\n\r\n    Our holy island’s shores at last,\r\n      One Tuesday morn they reach;\r\n    But on the Hanois rocks are cast,\r\n      And soon on Rocquaine’s beach\r\n        The waves their lifeless corpses threw,\r\n        That vengeance still will guilt pursue,\r\n      Their dismal fate may teach.\r\n\r\n[230] EDITOR’S NOTE.--I have also met with an account of the\r\ndestruction of the Tower of Castle Cornet by lightning in 1672, in some\r\nold MSS. dated 1719, where the visitation is ascribed to the sins of\r\nthe people!\r\n\r\n[231] EDITOR’S NOTE.--On

their names, it might have been necessary, in\r\nspeaking of Sark, to describe where it is situated. Guernsey, Jersey,\r\nAlderney, Sark, and Man, were always associated together in Acts of\r\nParliament and in school books for teaching children geography; and\r\nwhile there were many who believed the five to form but one group,\r\nthere were many others who would have been very much puzzled to\r\npoint out on the map the precise situation of any one of them. Now,\r\nthanks to the incessant intercourse with England by means of steam,\r\nand the attractions the islands present as resorts for tourists and\r\nexcursionists, they are as well known as most watering places on the\r\nEnglish coast.\r\n\r\nSark, though the smallest of the group, is by many considered the most\r\nbeautiful of the Channel Islands, and, certainly in point of rock and\r\ncliff scenery, combined with the ever-varying effects of sea and sky,\r\nthere are few lines of coast, of the same extent, that can compare with\r\nit. So precipitous are the shores on all sides, that there are very few\r\nspots where a landing can be effected, and in former days it would not\r\nhave been difficult to repel an invader, merely by rolling down stones\r\nfrom the heights.\r\n\r\nOf the history of Sark but little is known. St. Maglorius, a Briton\r\nfrom South Wales, who succeeded his kinsman, St. Samson, Bishop of Dol,\r\nabout the year 565, in that see, gave up a few years afterwards his\r\npastoral charge to his successor, St. Budoc, and retired to end his\r\ndays in meditation and prayer in Sark, where he established a convent\r\nand college for training young men as missionaries to the neighbouring\r\nnations. As a priory, dependent probably on some one or other of the\r\nlarge monasteries in Normandy, this convent was still in existence\r\nin the reign of Edward III., but the wars between this monarch and\r\nthe French king, seem to have been the cause of the monks withdrawing\r\nthemselves entirely from the island about the year 1349. After the\r\ndeparture of the monks, Sark appears to have become the resort of\r\npirates, who did so much injury to the trade of the Channel, that,\r\nin 1356, a vessel belonging to the port of Rye was fitted out by the\r\nmerchants of that town and of Winchelsea to endeavour to expel this\r\nband of marauders. This they succeeded in doing, and are said to have\r\neffected an entry into the island by means of a stratagem, which Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh, sometime Governor of Jersey, where he may be supposed\r\nto have gained his information, relates as having occurred in the reign\r\nof Queen Mary, and attributes to the crew of a Flemish ship.\r\n\r\nWe copy Sir Walter Raleigh’s account of the re-taking of Sark, from\r\nhis _History of the World_, Part I., Book IV., chapter XI., p. 18, but\r\nmust premise by saying that he is incorrect in stating that Sark had\r\nbeen surprised by the French in the reign of Queen Mary. It was in the\r\nyear 1549, during the reign of her brother Edward VI., that the French,\r\nbeing at war with England, and finding the island uninhabited, landed\r\nfour hundred men and took possession of it. The anonymous author of\r\n_Les Chroniques de Jersey_, written apparently in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, in noticing the recapture of Sark by Flemings, says nothing\r\nof the stratagem, but simply that, guided by some Guernseymen, they\r\nlanded at night and overpowered the French garrison, which, at that\r\ntime, was very much reduced in numbers.\r\n\r\n“The Island of _Sark_, joining to _Guernzey_, and of that Government,\r\nwas in Queen _Mary’s_ time surprized by the _French_, and could never\r\nhave been recovered again by strong hand, having Cattle and Corn\r\nenough upon the Place to feed so many Men as will serve to defend it,\r\nand being every way so inaccessible that it might be held against the\r\n_Great Turk_. Yet by the industry of a Gentleman of the _Netherlands_,\r\nit was in this Sort regained. He anchored in the Road with one Ship,\r\nand, pretending the Death of his Merchant, besought the _French_ that\r\nthey might bury their Merchant in hallowed Ground, and in the Chapel\r\nof that Isle; offering a Present to the _French_ of such Commodities\r\nas they had aboard. Whereto (with Condition that they should not come\r\nashore with any Weapon, not so much as with a Knife), the _French_\r\nyielded. Then did the _Flemings_ put a Coffin into their Boat, not\r\nfilled with a Dead Carcass, but with Swords, Targets and Harquebuzes.\r\nThe _French_ received them at their Landing, and, searching every one\r\nof them so narrowly as they could not hide a Penknife, gave them leave\r\nto draw their Coffin up the Rocks with great difficulty. Some part\r\nof the _French_ took the _Flemish_ Boat, and rowed aboard their Ship\r\nto fetch the Commodities promised, and what else they pleased, but,\r\nbeing entered, they were taken and bound. The _Flemings_ on the Land,\r\nwhen they had carried their Coffin into the Chapel, shut the Door\r\nto them, and, taking their Weapons out of the Coffin, set upon the\r\n_French_. They run to the Cliff, and cry to their Companions aboard the\r\n_Fleming_ to come to their Succour. But, finding the Boat charged with\r\n_Flemings_, yielded themselves and the Place.”\r\n\r\nFalle, the historian of Jersey, in citing this anecdote says:--“I\r\nhave seen Memoirs which confirm the taking of this Island by such a\r\nStratagem; but the other Circumstances of Time and Persons do not agree\r\nwith the foregoing Story.”\r\n\r\nHe then quotes, in a footnote, a passage from a MS. chronicle in Latin,\r\nwhich appears to have been in the possession of the de Carteret family,\r\nSeigneurs of St. Ouen, in Jersey, giving an account of the recapture of\r\nSark by a vessel from Rye, by means of the stratagem related above, but\r\nhe does not assign any date to the transaction.\r\n\r\nIt would be rash to assert that no such event ever occurred in the\r\nhistory of Sark, but it is curious to note that similar stories\r\nare told of Harold Hardráda, a Scandinavian adventurer who was in\r\nthe service of the Byzantine Emperors, and of the famous sea-king,\r\nHastings. The former fell dangerously ill while besieging a town in\r\nSicily. His men requested permission to bury him with due solemnity,\r\nand, on bringing the coffin to the gates of the town, were received\r\nby the clergy. No sooner, however, were they within the gates than\r\nthey set down the coffin across the entrance, drew their swords, made\r\nthemselves masters of the place, and massacred all the male inhabitants.\r\n\r\nHastings, about the year 857, entered the Mediterranean with a large\r\nfleet, appeared before the ancient Etruscan city of Luna, professed to\r\nbe desirous of becoming a Christian, and was baptised by the Bishop.\r\nAfter a time he pretended to be dangerously ill, and gave out that he\r\nwould leave the rich booty he had amassed to the Church, if, in the\r\nevent of his death, the Bishop would allow him to be interred in one of\r\nthe churches of the city. This was conceded, and, shortly afterwards,\r\nhis followers appeared, bearing a coffin, which they pretended\r\ncontained his dead body. No sooner had they entered the church and set\r\nit down, than Hastings started up, sword in hand, and slew the Bishop.\r\nHis followers drew their swords, and, in the confusion, soon made\r\nthemselves masters of the city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Mill, Talbot.]\r\n\r\nThese particulars are taken from Bohn’s editions of Mallet’s _Northern\r\nAntiquities_, pages 169 and 170. Perhaps the earliest known germ of\r\nthis story is to be found in the famous Trojan horse; but it is curious\r\nto note that a tale, similar in all its incidents to that related of\r\nSark, is told as having happened in the reign of William and Mary\r\nat Lundy, a small isle in the Bristol Channel. It will be found in\r\n_Murray’s Handbook for Travellers in Devon and Cornwall_; and as the\r\ndate assigned to it is long subsequent to the publication of Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh’s _History_, the natural conclusion is that the incidents in\r\nthe alleged taking of Lundy, have been borrowed from those of the\r\nrecapture of Sark, as narrated by Sir Walter. In confirmation of this\r\nview of the case we would draw attention to the circumstance that the\r\n“Gentleman of the Netherlands,” with his crew of Flemings, of the\r\nearlier narrative, becomes in the later edition of this story “A ship\r\nof war under Dutch colours.”\r\n\r\nWith these preliminary remarks, we proceed to copy the account of the\r\nsurprise of Lundy:--\r\n\r\n“The principal event in the history of Lundy is its capture by a party\r\nof Frenchmen, in the reign of William and Mary. A ship of war, under\r\nDutch colours, brought up in the roadstead, and sent ashore for some\r\nmilk, pretending that the captain was sick. The islanders supplied\r\nthe milk for several days, when at length the crew informed them that\r\ntheir captain was dead, and asked permission to bury him in consecrated\r\nground. This was immediately granted, and the inhabitants assisted in\r\ncarrying the coffin to the grave. It appeared to them rather heavy,\r\nbut they never for a moment suspected the nature of its contents.\r\nThe Frenchmen then requested the islanders to leave the church, as\r\nit was the custom of their country that foreigners should absent\r\nthemselves during a part of the ceremony, but informed them that they\r\nshould be admitted to see the body interred. They were not, however,\r\ndetained long in suspense; the doors were suddenly flung open, and the\r\nFrenchmen, armed from the pretended receptacle of the dead, rushed,\r\nwith triumphant shouts, upon the astonished inhabitants, and made them\r\nprisoners. They then quietly proceeded to desolate the island. They\r\nhamstrung the horses and bullocks, threw the sheep and goats over\r\nthe cliffs, and stripped the inhabitants even of their clothes. When\r\nsatisfied with plunder and mischief, they left the poor islanders in a\r\ncondition most truly disconsolate.”\r\n\r\nNo reference to any authority for the story is given, and it is\r\ndifficult to conceive that such an unprovoked and barbarous outrage,\r\nleading to no useful end--for Lundy could be of little or no use to\r\neither in time of war--could have been perpetrated so lately as the\r\nreign of William III.; but in the case of Lundy, as well as in that of\r\nSark, the date assigned to the event is extremely vague, some asserting\r\nthat it happened in the time of the great rebellion, others that it is\r\nto be found related by one of the old chroniclers who wrote the history\r\nof that long period of civil strife known as the Wars of the Roses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALARM OF PULIAS.\r\n\r\nA time of war between England and France would naturally cause great\r\nanxiety and excitement in all the Channel Islands. Situated as they\r\nare, so near to the French coast that buildings of any size may be\r\ndiscerned in clear weather by the naked eye, and coveted by that nation\r\never since the time when King John, having lost Normandy, the islands,\r\nfirm in their allegiance to the Duke, followed the fortunes of England,\r\nthey were peculiarly exposed to a hostile attack.\r\n\r\nEngland, fully aware of the importance of these islands, and knowing\r\nwell what a command of the Channel the possession of them gives, has\r\nalways been careful to have them well fortified and garrisoned in\r\ntime of war, and to keep a fleet cruising in their waters. The local\r\nmilitia--a body of men which may be more correctly termed trained\r\nbands, for, by the ancient constitution of the islands, every male\r\ncapable of bearing arms _must_ be trained to the use of them, and is\r\nrequired to serve his country from the age sixteen to sixty--forms\r\na subsidiary force, frequently and carefully drilled. In times when\r\ndanger was to be apprehended, watch houses were erected on all the\r\nhills and promontories round the coast, where a vigilant lookout was\r\nkept up night and day; and near each of these was placed a large stack\r\nof dried furze, which might be set on fire at a moment’s warning, and\r\nwhich would convey the intelligence of approaching danger to all parts\r\nof the island. The keeping of these guards was confided to the militia,\r\nor, to speak more precisely, to householders, who were told off by the\r\nconstables of their respective parishes for this duty. Every house, in\r\nits turn, had to furnish a man, and even females living alone were not\r\nexempt, but were expected to find a substitute. These substitutes,\r\nbeing well paid for their trouble, were, of course, not difficult to\r\nbe met with; but as they were for the most part idle fellows, and as\r\nthey were enrolled under their employers’ names, these last sometimes\r\nfound themselves in an awkward predicament. It is said that two maiden\r\nladies, householders, of most unblemished reputation, and belonging to\r\ntwo of the most aristocratic families in Guernsey, were reported one\r\nmorning as having been drunk and disorderly on guard the previous night!\r\n\r\nDuring the last wars between England and France there does not appear\r\nto have been, except on one occasion, any very serious alarm in\r\nGuernsey; but every now and then the sight of ships of war off Cape La\r\nHague, in the neighbourhood of Cherbourg, gave rise to some uneasiness,\r\nand put the island on the alert. It is no wonder if some amount of fear\r\nwas felt by the inhabitants on these occasions, when we remember the\r\npanic that Bonaparte’s threatened invasion in flat-bottomed boats from\r\nBoulogne, occasioned in England.\r\n\r\nIt was during the American war, in the early part of the year 1781,\r\nshortly after the attempt made on Jersey by the French adventurer, de\r\nRullecour, so gallantly repelled by a small body of the regular forces\r\nand the militia of that island, under the command of Major Pierson, who\r\nwas killed fighting bravely at the head of his troops, that a drunken\r\nfrolic of three thoughtless youths threw the whole island of Guernsey\r\ninto a state of consternation, and was the unfortunate cause of the\r\ndeath of several sick persons.\r\n\r\nOn the night of Sunday, the 4th of March, these men, officers in one\r\nof the militia regiments, after attending a muster of the force, which,\r\nin those days, generally took place on the Sunday, had finished the\r\nday by dining together, and were returning from the Castel parish to\r\ntheir homes in the Vale and St. Sampson’s. Their way was along the\r\nsea-coast, at that time not nearly so thickly inhabited as at present,\r\nand, on arriving at an almost solitary house, situated near the marsh\r\nof Pulias, just at the foot of the hill of Noirmont, on which a watch\r\nand a beacon, ready to be fired, were always in readiness, the fancy\r\ntook them to knock at the door of the cottage, and to represent\r\nthemselves as part of a French force, consisting of over ten thousand\r\nmen, who had just effected a landing. They demanded that a guide should\r\nbe furnished them forthwith to shew them the most direct road to the\r\ntown, and to the residence of the Governor, promising that he should\r\nbe amply rewarded for his trouble. It so chanced that the only inmates\r\nof the house were an old man and his wife. With admirable presence of\r\nmind, the man replied that it was out of his power to serve them as\r\nguide, as he had the misfortune to be stone blind, but that if they\r\nwent a few hundred yards further in a direction which he pointed out to\r\nthem, they would find another habitation, where, no doubt, the guide\r\nthey were in search of would be forthcoming. They took their departure,\r\ngoing in the direction indicated to them, and, no sooner were their\r\nbacks turned, than the old woman opened a window in the rear of the\r\nhouse, and made her way across the fields, over hedges and ditches, and\r\nthrough the thick furze that covers the hill, to the signal station\r\non the summit of Noirmont. She told her story to the men on watch,\r\nand it was not many minutes before the beacon was in flames, and the\r\nsignal taken up by all the others round the coast. A swift messenger\r\nwas sent into town with the unwelcome news. Before long, the alarm had\r\nspread into every part of the island. The troops in garrison were soon\r\nunder arms, the militia regiments mustered at their respective places\r\nof meeting, and scouts were sent out to search for the enemy, and to\r\nfind out where they had taken up their position. With the return of\r\ndaylight, the reconnoitring parties came back to headquarters, bringing\r\nthe reassuring intelligence that not a sign of an enemy was to be seen\r\non any part of the coast. It was then evident that the whole community\r\nhad been made the victim of a heartless hoax. A strict enquiry was set\r\non foot to discover the authors of it, but, though suspicion pointed\r\nstrongly in the direction of the real culprits, nothing definite could\r\nbe brought home to any one in particular; but the surmise was converted\r\ninto certainty by the sudden departure from the island of the suspected\r\nparties, who did not venture to return to their homes till many years\r\nafterwards, when the affair was well-nigh forgotten, and when there was\r\nno longer any danger of their being called to account for their mad\r\nfreak. A bitter feeling was, however, engendered in the minds of the\r\npeople, which found vent in satirical songs, some verses of which are\r\nstill remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEAN BRETON, THE PILOT.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times of which we have any authentic record, the\r\npeople of Guernsey appear to have been a seafaring race. Perhaps they\r\ninherit their disposition for maritime pursuits from their remote\r\nancestors, those hardy Scandinavian adventurers, who, there can be no\r\ndoubt, found these islands a very convenient resort in their early\r\npiratical incursions, and probably had settled in them long before\r\nthey took possession of that fertile province of France, now known\r\nas Normandy, the land of the Northmen. But, however this may be, the\r\ninhabitants of these islands could scarcely be other than mariners,\r\nsurrounded as they are by a sea abounding in an endless variety of\r\nfish, and especially when we take into consideration the small extent\r\nof land in them available for agricultural purposes compared with\r\nthe teeming population which,--exclusive of that of the town, which\r\nhas increased considerably since the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury--appears from authentic documents to have been quite as dense\r\nin the rural districts in the early part of the fourteenth century as\r\nit is in the present day.[232]\r\n\r\nTheir situation gave the islands importance in a strategical point\r\nof view, and was favourable also to the development of commerce,\r\npossessing moreover, as they did, the extraordinary privilege of\r\nneutrality in times of war between England and France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water Lane, Couture.]\r\n\r\nAfter the forfeiture of Normandy by King John, it was long before the\r\ninhabitants of that Province acquiesced cordially in their change of\r\nmasters; and the district known as _Le Cotentin_, to which the islands\r\nnaturally appertained, was last to give up their allegiance to their\r\nancient Dukes. Indeed, it can scarcely be said to have been lost\r\nentirely to England, until the final expulsion of our kings from all\r\ntheir continental possessions in the reign of Henry VI. During the\r\nlong wars between the two nations, the possession of these islands\r\nwas of the utmost importance to England, commanding as they did so\r\nlong a line of the French coast. Guernsey alone at that time possessed\r\na tolerably secure haven, the early existence of which is proved by\r\na charter of William the Conqueror, dated prior to his invasion of\r\nEngland, in which St. Peter Port is mentioned. Edward I. allowed of\r\ncertain dues on merchandise being levied for the improvement of this\r\nharbour, and that an active trade was carried on between Guernsey and\r\nthe English possessions in Acquitaine is undoubted. No wonder then that\r\nwe find the names of Guernsey ships in the lists of those chartered\r\nfor the conveyance of troops to France in time of war. But what,\r\nperhaps, more than anything else contributed to form a race of hardy\r\nand courageous seamen were the important fisheries, which, before the\r\ndiscovery of America and the banks of Newfoundland, gave employment\r\nto an immense amount of men, in catching, salting, and drying for\r\nexportation, the fish which abound in the neighbourhood of the islands.\r\nThe dangerous nature of the coast, and the surrounding seas, is owing\r\nto sunken rocks, strong currents and tides, which vary from day to\r\nday. It requires a life-long apprenticeship to become well acquainted\r\nwith all the hidden and open perils which threaten a seaman’s life.\r\nNo wonder then if some of our fishermen, brought up to the sea from\r\ntheir earliest youth, become experienced and fearless pilots, knowing\r\nevery reef, every set of the tide, and able to reckon to a nicety,\r\nhow long the current will run in one direction, and when it may be\r\nexpected to take a different course. In making their calculations they\r\nare very much guided by the bearings of certain marks on land, such as\r\nchurches, windmills, or other conspicuous buildings, and the following\r\nanecdote, related of one of our pilots, Jean Breton, is well worthy of\r\nbeing remembered, not more for the skill he displayed under very trying\r\ncircumstances, than for the significant and touching answer he gave\r\nwhen questioned whether he was sure of his marks.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1794, Captain Sir James Saumarez was at Plymouth, in\r\ncommand of H.M.S. _Crescent_ and a squadron consisting of two other\r\nfrigates, the _Druid_ and the _Eurydice_, and two or three armed\r\nluggers and cutters. He received orders to sail for Guernsey and\r\nJersey, to ascertain, if possible, the enemy’s force in Cancale Bay and\r\nSt. Malo. On the 7th of June he left Plymouth, having, a day or two\r\nbefore, accidentally met Jean Breton, whom he knew. He asked him what\r\nhe was doing there. “I am waiting, Sir, for a passage to Guernsey,”\r\nwas the reply. Sir James, whose active benevolence always prompted\r\nhim to do a kind action when it was in his power, offered to take\r\nhim across, and his kindness to his poor fellow-countryman was amply\r\nrepaid in the sequel. The day after their departure from Plymouth,\r\nwhen about twelve leagues to the N.N.W. of Guernsey, and with a fresh\r\nN.E. breeze, the English ships fell in at dawn with a French squadron\r\nof considerably greater force. The superiority of the enemy being much\r\ntoo great to be opposed with any chance of success, it became the\r\nimperative duty of the English commander to effect, if possible, the\r\nescape of his ships. Observing that his own ships, the _Crescent_\r\nand the _Druid_, had the advantage in sailing, and fearing that the\r\n_Eurydice_, which was a bad sailer, would fall into the enemy’s hands,\r\nhe shortened sail, and, having ordered the _Eurydice_, by signal, to\r\npush for Guernsey, he continued, by occasionally showing a disposition\r\nto engage, to amuse the enemy and lead him off until the _Eurydice_ was\r\nsafe. He now tacked, and, in order to save the _Druid_, closed with\r\nthe enemy, passing along their line. The capture of the _Crescent_ now\r\nseemed inevitable, but the _Druid_ and the _Eurydice_ escaped in the\r\nmeanwhile, and arrived safely in Guernsey Roads, the smaller craft\r\nreturning to Plymouth.\r\n\r\nBut Sir James had, for his own preservation, a scheme, to effect which\r\nrequired great courage, consummate skill in the management of his ship,\r\nand an intimate knowledge of the intricate passages through the reefs\r\nwhich render navigation, on that part of the coast in particular, so\r\nvery dangerous. The providential presence of Jean Breton on board\r\nenabled him to put this scheme into execution with an almost certainty\r\nof success. Sir James knew that if there was a man in Guernsey\r\nthoroughly acquainted with every danger that besets that iron-bound\r\nshore, Jean Breton was that man; and, making a feint to run his ship on\r\nthe rocks to avoid being captured by the enemy, but trusting implicitly\r\nin his pilot’s skill, he ordered him to steer through a narrow channel,\r\na feat which had never before been attempted by a vessel of that size.\r\nThe result of this manœuvre was watched with the utmost anxiety from\r\nthe shore, and remarks were made by the lookers-on that Jean Breton\r\nalone, of all the pilots in Guernsey, would venture on such a perilous\r\nfeat, little suspecting that it was indeed he, to whom, under God,\r\nwas to be attributed the safety of the ship and her gallant crew. The\r\nfrigate was soon brought to in a secure anchorage under shelter of the\r\nfire of the batteries on shore, and the French, mortified at being\r\nbaulked of a prize of which they had made quite sure, had to retire\r\nfrom the contest.\r\n\r\nThe scene of this daring adventure was to the westward of the island,\r\noff the bays known as Le Vazon and Caûbo, on the shore of the former of\r\nwhich Jean Breton’s cottage was situated, and full in view of Sir James\r\nSaumarez’s own manorial residence, a position truly remarkable, for on\r\none side was a prospect of death or a French prison, on the other side\r\nhome with all its joys! When in the most perilous part of the Channel,\r\nSir James asked the pilot whether he was sure of his marks? “Quite\r\nsure,” was Jean Breton’s reply, “for there is your house and yonder is\r\nmy own!”\r\n\r\n[232] EDITOR’S NOTE.--This was true years ago when Sir Edgar MacCulloch\r\nwrote the above, but it has ceased to be true now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nNursery Rhymes and Children’s Games.\r\n\r\n    “Gather up all the traditions, and even the nursery\r\n    songs; no one can tell of what value they may prove to an\r\n    antiquary.”--Southey, in a letter to Mrs. Bray, quoted in her\r\n    _Borders of the Tamar and the Tavy_.\r\n\r\n[Some of these I have found lying loose among Sir Edgar MacCulloch’s\r\nMSS.

Those who are seated keep their hands in their\r\nlaps with their fists closed, and endeavour to pass a pebble or other\r\nsmall object from one to the other, without its being perceived by the\r\nchild who is in the middle. While the game is going on they recite the\r\nfollowing rhyme:--\r\n\r\n    “Mon toussebelet va demandant,\r\n    Ma fausse vieille va quérant,\r\n    Sur lequel prends tu, bon enfant?”[233]\r\n\r\nThe child in the centre of the circle is in the meantime on the look\r\nout to discover into whose hands the pebble is passing, and, if he can\r\nsucceed in arresting it in the possession of any one of the players, he\r\ntakes his place in the ring, and the one in whose hands the pebble was\r\ncaught, replaces him in the centre.\r\n\r\n_From Rachel du Port._\r\n\r\n[233] EDITOR’S NOTE.--All Guernsey nursery rhymes, etc., are naturally\r\neither in old French or Guernsey French, dating as they do from the\r\ntimes when no other language was spoken in the island.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILDREN’S GAME.\r\n\r\nA child stands in the middle and says:\r\n\r\n    “J’ai tant d’énfants à marier.”\r\n\r\nChorus from children standing round:\r\n\r\n    “Ah!

Things are now much changed. The\r\npresence of a large garrison during the wars that arose out of the\r\nfirst French Revolution, and the influx of a mixed population since the\r\npeace, altered the character of these assemblies in town. They came to\r\nbe regarded with disfavour; parents discouraged their children from\r\nattending them; the prejudice against them extended to the country\r\nparishes, and the puritanical feeling that grew up with the rapid\r\nspread of dissent among the labouring classes was entirely opposed to\r\nany species of amusement. Whether the cause of morality has gained much\r\nby this over strictness is questionable.\r\n\r\nThe dances at these meetings were of a very primitive character,\r\nconsisting almost entirely of a species of jig, by two performers, or\r\nin joining hands and moving round at a quick pace in a circle. When\r\na musician was not to be procured, recourse was had to the united\r\nvoices of the dancers, and an ancient roundelay or “_ronde_,” no doubt\r\noriginally imported from France, where such dances are still common\r\namong the peasantry, helped to carry on the amusement of the evening.\r\nIt is still danced occasionally by young people and children, and, as\r\nthe sole remaining specimen of this kind of diversion, deserves to be\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nThe performers, who must consist of an equal number of either sex\r\nplaced alternately, join hands in a circle. They then dance round,\r\nsinging in chorus:--\r\n\r\n    “Saluez, Messieurs et Dames,\r\n    Ah! mon beau lau-ri-er!” (bis)\r\n\r\nOne of the girls is then selected and placed in the middle of the\r\ncircle, and the rest of the party continue to dance round her singing:--\r\n\r\n    “Ah! la belle, entrez en danse!\r\n    Ah! mon beau lau-ri-er!” (bis)\r\n\r\nThe next verse is:--\r\n\r\n    “Faites nous la révérence,\r\n    Ah! mon beau lau-ri-er!” (bis)\r\n\r\nOn this the damsel curtseys round to the company, who go on singing:--\r\n\r\n    “Faites le pot à deux anses,\r\n    Ah! mon beau lau-ri-er!” (bis)\r\n\r\nThe dancer must now set her arms a-kimbo, and so figure away in the\r\ncentre of the ring until the strain changes to:--\r\n\r\n    “Jambe, enjambe en ma présence,\r\n    Ah! mon beau lau-ri-er!” (bis)\r\n\r\nThis figure generally causes much merriment, for the performer is\r\nexpected to clasp both arms round one uplifted knee, and hop about on\r\nthe other foot, the result of which is not unfrequently a fall. Then\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    “Prenez cil qui vous ressemble,\r\n    Ah! mon beau lau-ri-er!” (bis)\r\n\r\nThe maiden now makes selection of a partner among the youths, and both\r\njoin hands in the middle of the circle, while the following words are\r\nsung to a different tune and measure:--\r\n\r\n    “Entr’embrassez-vous par le jeu d’amourette,\r\n    Entr’embrassez-vous par le jeu d’amour.”\r\n\r\nA tender embrace follows, and then the assistants sing:--\r\n\r\n    “Entr’embrassez-vous par le jeu d’amourette,\r\n    Entr’embrassez-vous par le jeu d’amour.”\r\n\r\nA kiss is now claimed from the compliant damsel, after which is sung:--\r\n\r\n    “Entrequittez-vous par le jeu d’amourette,\r\n    Entrequittez-vous par le jeu d’amour.”\r\n\r\nThe girl now leaves the young man in the midst of the circle and\r\nreturns to her original place, when the dance recommences with such\r\nverbal alterations as the change of the principal performers renders\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned cushion dance, which delighted the romps of the Court\r\nof the merry-monarch, Charles II., is not altogether forgotten on these\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nThere are several other dancing rhymes and snatches of dancing times in\r\nexistence--such as the one quoted by Métivier in his _Dictionnaire_,\r\npage 148:--\r\n\r\n    “Ma coummère, aquànd je danse, men cotillon fait-i bien?\r\n    Ah! vraiment oui, ma coummère, i va bien mûx que le mien.\r\n    I va de ci, i va de là;\r\n    I va fort bien, ma coummère,\r\n    I va fort bien coumme i va.”\r\n\r\nAnother version is:--\r\n\r\n    “Ma coummère, aquànd je danse, men cotillon fait-i bien?\r\n    Ah! vraiment oui, ma coummère, i va bien mûx que le mien.\r\n    I va d’ici, I va de là, men cotillon,\r\n    Vole, vole, vole, men cotillon vol’ra.”\r\n\r\nOne dance consisted of a sort of see-saw in different corners of the\r\nroom, the couple repeating:--\r\n\r\n    “Dansez donc, ou ne dansez pas,\r\n    Faites le donc, ou ne le faites pas,\r\n    La-la-la.” (bis).\r\n\r\nDance and repeat!\r\n\r\n\r\nSark Games.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--In a _Descriptive Account of the Island of Sark_,\r\npublished in Clarke’s _Guernsey Magazine_ for September and October,\r\n1875, the Rev. J. L. V. Cachemaille wrote:--“The public games and\r\namusements of the Sarkese are few, and of a simple kind; and it is only\r\nchildren or young people who take part in them now-a-days. Formerly\r\nthey used to have a favourite amusement, consisting of six or eight\r\nmen, or big boys, who placed themselves in a line, one behind the\r\nother, and held each other firmly round the waist, while two outsiders\r\nmade every effort to pull them apart one after another, till one only\r\nremained. This game they called ‘_Uprooting the Gorse_,’ and the last\r\nman represented the largest or principal root. Children still keep\r\nup this game, but not very universally, nor is it often played. It\r\nwas one of the chief amusements of the ‘_Veilles_.’” Mr. Cachemaille\r\nalso wrote:--“A person, either young or old, disguised himself in a\r\nmanner to frighten people. At the end of a stick he carried the head\r\nof a horse or donkey, and this he placed on his own head, having first\r\nenveloped himself in a sheet. By means of cords, he made the jaws of\r\nthis head to open and shut with a noise, then he ran after one or the\r\nother, endeavouring to bite them with the teeth of those horrible jaws;\r\nwhereupon everybody ran away as fast as they could, and there was a\r\ngeneral turmoil, the people either screaming with fright, or else\r\nlaughing at the joke. This head made the round of all the “_Veilles_,”\r\nfollowed by a crowd of people, and, until quite latterly, one of these\r\nheads was still to be seen in one of the principal farm houses.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nSuperstitions Generally.\r\n\r\n    “Even a single hair casts a shadow.”\r\n\r\n                       --_Lord Verulam._\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--In this chapter are collected all the loose and\r\nunclassified bits of Folk-Lore scattered among Sir Edgar MacCulloch’s\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe widely-diffused idea that the spirits of the dead sometimes return\r\nin the form of birds, is not altogether obsolete in these islands.\r\n\r\nA widow, whose husband had been drowned at sea, asked the Seigneur of\r\nSark whether a robin that was constantly flying round her cottage and\r\nalighting on her window-sill, might not possibly be the soul of the\r\ndeparted.[241]\r\n\r\nThe robin is a bird specially reverenced in Guernsey, as the\r\nwidely-accepted belief is that it was the robin who first brought fire\r\nto the island. In bringing it across the water he burned his breast,\r\nand this is the reason why, to this day, the breast of the robin is\r\ntinged with red. “My mother,” said the old woman who told me this,\r\n“had a great veneration for this little bird, which had been so great\r\na benefactor to those who came before us, for who can live without\r\nfire.”[242]\r\n\r\n_Soucique._ This is the name given in Guernsey to the marigold, and\r\nalso to the fire-crested or golden-crested wren, the word being\r\nderived from the Latin “solsequium.” It is probably the same as the\r\n“heliotropium.” The shape and colour of the flower, resembling the\r\ndisc of the sun surrounded with rays, and the fact of the flower\r\nopening at sunrise and closing at sunset, would naturally cause it to\r\nbe associated with that luminary, and considered sacred to Apollo. It\r\nis not quite so easy to account for the same name being given to the\r\nfire-crested and golden-crested wren, but we know that the wren plays a\r\nconsiderable part in the mythology of the Aryan nations, and is one of\r\nthose birds which is believed to have brought fire from heaven for the\r\nuse of man.[243] The story of its outwitting the eagle, in the contest\r\nfor the sovereignty among birds, and getting nearer the sun by perching\r\non its back, may have gained for it a name, which, as we have seen,\r\nsignifies “a follower of the sun.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of the Old Town House (on the left) of the de\r\nSausmarez Family, situated where St. Paul’s Chapel now stands.]\r\n\r\nThe willow-wren is known among us as “_Le Ribet_,” from _Ri_ (roi), and\r\n“_bet_,” the form known in the province of Bearn of “bel.” Vallancey\r\nsays:--“The Druids represented this as the king of birds, hence the\r\nname of this bird in all the European languages. Latin, _Regulus_;\r\nFrench, _Roitelet_; Welsh, _Bren_ (or “king”); Teutonic, _Konig Vogel_;\r\nDutch, _Konije_, _etc._”\r\n\r\nA magpie crossing one’s way is of evil augury, portending vexation, or\r\ntrouble of some kind. Crows cawing much in the neighbourhood of a house\r\nis also a sign of impending trouble.[244]\r\n\r\nWhen the cuckoo is heard for the first time in the year one ought to\r\nrun a few steps forward in order to ensure being light for the rest of\r\nthe year. If you have money in your pocket, and turn it, or shake it,\r\nit will ensure good luck, and you will not want money throughout the\r\nrest of the year.[245]\r\n\r\n“Money should be turned in the pocket when the cuckoo is heard for the\r\nfirst time.”\r\n\r\nAn old woman, living at the Vale used to say:--_“En Guernesi nous a\r\ncoutume de dire en oyant le coucou pour la première fais:--‘Si tu ne\r\ncuers pas tu seras lourd toute l’annâie.’ Nous remue étout l’argent\r\nqu’nous peut aver dans les paoutes, en les secouant--et il y a des gens\r\nqui se mettent à genouaïx. La première fais que nous-ôt le coucou il\r\nfaut mettre une grosse roque sus sa tête, arroütaïr à courre, et nou\r\nsera légier toute l’annâie._”\r\n\r\n[241] See _Indo-European Folk-Lore_.\r\n\r\n[242] From Rachel Du Port.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\n“Another version of this story is: The robin redbreast brought fire to\r\nthe Island, and by so doing burnt his breast, as he had been carrying\r\na lighted torch in his beak. When he arrived with his breast-feathers\r\nburnt and raw and red, all the other birds were so sorry for him that\r\nthey each gave him a feather, except the owl, who would not, so that is\r\nwhy he no longer dares show his face by day.”--_Told me in 1896 by the\r\nlate Miss Annie Chepmell, who had heard it from an old servant._\r\n\r\n“Quand la rouge-gorge alla chercher l’ feu, ses plumes furent toutes\r\nbrulées, alors les oiseaux en eurent pitié et ils résolurent de lui\r\ndonner chacun une plume pour la réhabiller. Seul le chat-huant,\r\noiseau orgueilleux et peu compatissant, refusa. C’est pour cela que,\r\nlorsqu’il se montre au jour, tous les petits oiseaux crient après lui,\r\net la rouge-gorge en particulier, qui, par son cri, lui reproche son\r\norgeuil.”--_Traditions et Superstitions de la Haute Bretagne_, Tome\r\nII., p. 201.\r\n\r\n[243] One country tradition says that the wren brought water to\r\nGuernsey.\r\n\r\n[244] From J. R. Tardif, Esq.\r\n\r\n[245] See “Folk-Lore of the North of England,” in the _Monthly Packet_,\r\nFebruary, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCKOO RHYMES.\r\n\r\n    _“En Avril_\r\n    _Le coucou crie_\r\n    _S’il est vif.”_\r\n\r\n    _“Le coucou_\r\n    _S’en va en Août_\r\n    _La barbe d’orge_\r\n    _Li pique la gorge.”_\r\n\r\n    _“Coucou-Varou_\r\n    _Bave[246] partout.”_\r\n\r\n(See _Notes and Queries_, 4th Series, Vol. III., 1869.)\r\n\r\nIt is thought lucky to shake one’s pockets and run a few steps, the\r\nfirst time one hears the cuckoo sing. The following lines are also\r\nrepeated by some, and the number of times the cuckoo utters his note is\r\ntaken as an answer to the question.\r\n\r\n    _“Coucou, cou-cou, dis mé_\r\n    _Combien d’ans je vivrai.”_[247]\r\n\r\nI remember when I was a child, my aunt, Miss de Sausmarez, making me\r\nremark how chickens, when they drink, lift up their heads at every sip,\r\nand telling me that they did so to thank God.[248]\r\n\r\nThe bone of the cuttle fish, which is found at times thrown up on the\r\nbeach, is called in Guernsey “_Pépie_.” It is supposed to possess the\r\nquality of healing the “pip” in chickens, also known as “la pépie.”\r\n\r\nA stye in the eye is called in Guernsey “_un laurier_,” and is to\r\nbe cured by bathing the eye with an infusion of laurel leaves or\r\n“lauriers.”\r\n\r\nIf a fisherman, on setting out, sees a humble bee flying in the same\r\ndirection as he is going, he considers it a good omen, and that he is\r\nsure of a plentiful catch. If, however, the insect meets him, it is\r\nquite the reverse. The ill-luck, however, may be averted by spitting\r\nthrice over the left shoulder. Omens of good or bad luck are also\r\nderived from sea-birds. All depends on whether a gull or a cormorant\r\nis seen first, as, if a cormorant, no fish is to be expected that day.\r\nAll fishermen also know how unlucky it is to count one’s fish until the\r\ncatch has been landed, as, however freely they may be biting, counting\r\nthem would inevitably stop all sport for the day.[249]\r\n\r\nIf a pair of bellows is put on a table, some great misfortune is sure\r\nto happen in the household.[250]\r\n\r\nRichard Ferguson, fisherman, of the Salerie, tells me that there is\r\na great objection against taking currant cake with them when they go\r\na-fishing, it is sure to bring bad luck.\r\n\r\n[246] _Bave_--The cuckoo spittle.\r\n\r\n[247] See Thorpe’s _Northern Mythology_, and Chambers’ _Popular\r\nRhymes_, p. 193.\r\n\r\n[248] See _English Folk-Lore_, p. 95.\r\n\r\n[249] From the late Colonel de Vic Tupper.\r\n\r\n[250] From J. R. Tardif, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.\r\n\r\nThe following scraps of Folk-Lore I have gathered from old people in\r\nSt. Martin’s parish, in the years 1897-99.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN IN THE MOON.\r\n\r\n“_J’ai ouï dire à ma gran’mère i’y a be’tôt chinquante ans qu’l’bouan\r\nhomme que nou veit dans la lune enlevit un fagot de bouais le Dimanche,\r\net pour chut fait le Bon Gyu le condamnit à s’en allair dans la lune\r\njusqu’au Jour du Jugement. V’la l’histouaire de chut poure Mâbet que\r\nnon vait si souvent perqui là-haut._”--_From Mrs. Le Patourel._\r\n\r\nA robin flying to the window or in the house is a sign of death. Crows\r\nflocking together and cawing over the house are most unlucky. To go\r\nout and meet three crows or three magpies means good luck, all other\r\nnumbers mean misfortune.\r\n\r\nNone should ever cut their finger nails on either a Sunday or a Friday\r\nif they wish to prosper. A baby’s first nails should never be cut, but\r\nbitten.\r\n\r\nOn being given a present of scissors or a knife, a double[251] should\r\nalways be given in exchange. Parsley should never be taken as a gift,\r\nbut it is very lucky to steal some (!).\r\n\r\nNo berried plants such as ivy, etc., should be brought into the house\r\nbefore Christmas, and it is especially unlucky if, when they are\r\nbrought in, they are allowed to touch the mantel shelf. May should\r\n_never_ be brought into a house, and many people, especially in\r\nAlderney, consider that to bring in furze or gorse means to introduce\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nShould an unmarried woman go in and out of a house through a window\r\nwhich is not destined as a means of entrance or exit, she will never\r\nmarry.\r\n\r\nAn umbrella should never be opened in a house, or placed upon a table,\r\nquarrelling and strife are sure to follow.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed to be very unlucky when going out of the house, if the\r\nfirst person you meet is a woman. Never pass her if you can avoid it,\r\nbut stand still and let her pass you.\r\n\r\nTo keep witches from entering a stable and molesting the cattle a piece\r\nof naturally pierced flint-stone should be tied to the key of the\r\nstable door. On going down to a beach it is considered lucky to pick up\r\na small stone and bring it away with you. Never give away money with a\r\nhole in it.\r\n\r\nIf you think you are bewitched or that any one has a spite against you,\r\nthrow a lump of salt on the fire, and as it burns blue the spite will\r\nevaporate.\r\n\r\nFanny Ingrouille, of the Forest parish, from whom the foregoing was\r\nobtained, also repeated the following formula, which apparently was a\r\nprogramme for the week of a Guernsey country girl.\r\n\r\n    _“Au matin--Pierre Martin_\r\n    _Au ser--Jean Mauger_[252]\r\n    _Lundi, Mardi--Fêtes_\r\n    _Mercredi--Mà à ta tête_\r\n    _Jeudi, Vendredi--Fort travâs_\r\n    _Samedi--A la ville_\r\n    _Dimanche--Vée les filles.”_\r\n\r\n[251] The smallest local coin, value one-eighth of a penny.\r\n\r\n[252] “_Martin_” and “_Mauger_” are two of the most widely spread of\r\nthe country names.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUERNSEY LOCAL NICK-NAMES.\r\n\r\nALDERNEY = Vâques (Cows).\r\n\r\nSARK = Corbins (Crows).\r\n\r\nJERSEY = Crapauds (Toads).\r\n\r\nGUERNSEY = Anes (Donkeys).\r\n\r\n\r\nGUERNSEY PARISH NICK-NAMES.\r\n\r\nST.

They serve to\r\n    be recited upon occasion of themselves. They serve, if you take\r\n    out the kernel of them, and make them your own.”--_Lord Verulam._\r\n\r\n\r\nNo nation is without its proverbs; but while in many cases these pithy\r\nsayings are the same in all languages, and merely literal translations\r\nfrom one dialect to another, in other instances the idea only is\r\npresent, and the words in which the proverb is expressed have little\r\nor nothing in common, as, for example, the English saying:--“A bird in\r\nthe hand is worth two in the bush,” appears in French in the far less\r\npicturesque form of “_un ‘tiens’ vaut mieut que deux ‘tu l’auras’_.”\r\nSometimes, from the peculiar circumstances of the people using it, a\r\nproverb takes a local tinge, and, in so doing, may change considerably\r\nfrom its original wording, while continuing at the same time to convey\r\na similar lesson. Thus the pastoral saying:--“To lose one’s _sheep_\r\nfor a penn’orth of tar,” becomes, very naturally, among a nautical\r\npopulation, “to lose one’s _ship_, etc.”\r\n\r\nSome few proverbs are so thoroughly local as to appear to have\r\noriginated in the place where they are used.\r\n\r\nGuernsey is not rich in proverbs properly so called; but, as might be\r\nexpected among an agricultural and maritime people, weather-sayings\r\nare not uncommon. Many of these could no doubt be traced to the\r\nmother-country, Normandy, but some few may be indigenous, and the\r\nresult of local observation.\r\n\r\nWe will give specimens of each class of these proverbial expressions,\r\nwith such remarks as may be necessary to explain them as far as they\r\ncan be explained; and, although many of them might be put into modern\r\nFrench, we have preferred retaining the old Norman dialect still\r\npreserved as the language of all the rural parts of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\nProverbs.\r\n\r\n_Nou (on) ne va pas au jàn (àjonc) sans ses gànts._--No one goes to cut\r\nfurze without gloves. If you would undertake an arduous matter, be well\r\nprepared for it.\r\n\r\n_Ch’est la coue (queue) qui est la pière (pire) à écorchier\r\n(écorcher)._--It is the tail that is the hardest to flay. It is often\r\nmore difficult to bring an affair to a successful end than to begin it.\r\n\r\n_Qui sent mànjue (démangeaison) se gratte._--He who itches scratches\r\nhimself. Nearly equivalent to the English saying, “The cap fits.”\r\n\r\n_Quand le bouissé (boisseau) est pllein, i’ jette._--When the\r\nbushel-measure is full it runs over. The last straw breaks the camel’s\r\nback.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Building the south arm of the Town Harbour, connecting\r\nCastle Cornet with the Island.]\r\n\r\n_Nécessitaï fait la vieille trottaïr._--Need will make an old woman\r\ntrot.\r\n\r\n_Au broue (brouille, embarras) est le gan (gain, profit)._--No exact\r\nequivalent is to be found for this proverb, but it means that profit,\r\nin some way or other, may be made where there is much doing. The\r\nEnglish saying “No pains, no gains,” comes near it.\r\n\r\n_Pûs (plus) de broue que de travâs (travail)._--More bustle than work.\r\nMuch cry and little wool.\r\n\r\n_Mettre daeux guerbes (deux gerbes) en un llian (lien)._--To bind up\r\ntwo sheaves with one wisp. To kill two birds with one stone.\r\n\r\n_Biautaï (beauté) sans bountaï (bonté), ne vaut pas vin\r\névantaï._--Beauty, without goodness, is not worth stale wine.\r\n\r\n_L’amour hâle (tire) pûs (plus) que chent (cent) bœufs._--Love draws\r\nmore than a hundred oxen.\r\n\r\n_A p’tit pourche (pourceau) grosse pânais._--The little pig gets the\r\nbig parsnip. The youngest child is the most petted.\r\n\r\n_Qui paie s’acquitte; qui s’acquitte s’enrichit._--He who pays his way\r\nkeeps out of debt; he who keeps out of debt gets rich. No comment is\r\nneeded on this thoroughly practical proverb.\r\n\r\n_Si nou (on) lli dounne ùn peis (pois) i’ prend une faïve._--If you\r\ngive him a pea, he’ll take a bean. Give him an inch, he’ll take an ell.\r\n\r\n_Ch’n’est pas ôve (avec) du vinaigre que nous (on) attrâpe des mouques\r\n(mouches)._--Flies are not caught with vinegar. Nothing is to be gained\r\nby roughness.\r\n\r\n_Qui peut volaïr (voler) ùn œuf, peut volaïr ùn bœuf._--He who would\r\nsteal an egg would steal an ox. Be honest in the smallest matters.\r\n\r\n_F’rine du guiablle (diable) s’en va en bran (son)._--The devil’s flour\r\nturns to bran. Ill-gotten wealth never prospers.\r\n\r\n_Chàngement d’herbage est bouan (bon) pour les jânes viaux (jeunes\r\nveaux)._--Change of pasture is good for young calves. Variety is\r\nnecessary for the young. “Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.”\r\n\r\n_I’ ne faut pas faire le cottìn (cabane, crêche) d’vànt que le viau\r\nseit naï._ (Avant que le veau ne soit né).--One must not make the crib\r\nbefore the calf is born. Do not count your chickens before they are\r\nhatched.\r\n\r\n_S’il ne l’a en breuf, il l’aira (l’aura) en soupe._--If he does not\r\nget it in broth, he’ll get it in soup. If he cannot obtain his end by\r\none means, he will by another.\r\n\r\n_Apprins au ber (berceau), dure jusqu’au ver._--What is learnt in the\r\ncradle goes with one to the grave--literally “to the worm.”\r\n\r\n_La bête d’un poure (pauvre) houme (homme) mourrait pûs-à-caoup (plus\r\ntôt) que li (lui)._--He would die more opportunely than a poor man’s\r\nbeast, is said of a person whose death would not leave much cause for\r\nregret.\r\n\r\n_Les p’tits tchiens (chiens) out de longues coues (queux)._--Is the\r\nequivalent of the French proverb, “dans les petites boîtes les bons\r\nonguents;” precious ointments are in small boxes.\r\n\r\n_Ch’est une querrue à tchiens (charrue à chiens)._--It is a plough\r\ndrawn by dogs, is said of any affair which is badly conducted--where\r\nthose who ought to work in concert are pulling different ways, like two\r\ndogs on a leash.\r\n\r\n_Un mouisson (oiseau) à la main vaut mûx que daeux qui volent._--A bird\r\nin the hand is worth two on the wing.\r\n\r\n_Il n’y a fagot qui n’trouve sen lliàn (lien)._--There is no faggot but\r\nwhat at last finds a band. Every Jack has his Jill; every dog has his\r\nday.\r\n\r\n_I’ n’y a fagot qui n’vaut sa lliache (liasse)._--There is no faggot so\r\nbad as not to be worth a band.\r\n\r\n_Qui mange la craïme ne rend pas du burre (beurre)._--He who eats his\r\ncream makes no butter. You cannot eat your cake and have it.\r\n\r\n_I’ ne vaut pas grànd burre (beurre)._--He or it is not worth much\r\nbutter; meaning, such an one is not worth much, the matter is not worth\r\ngoing to any expense about; an allusion to a worthless fish on which\r\nthe butter used in cooking it is so much thrown away.\r\n\r\n_Ecoute-paret (paroi) jamais n’ot dret (n’ouit droit)._--An\r\neavesdropper never hears good.\r\n\r\n_I’ n’y a rien itaï (tel) que sé (soi) sa qu’minse (chemise) lavaïr\r\n(laver)._--There is nothing like washing your own shirt. If you wish a\r\nthing well done, do it yourself. It is also used in the sense of “Wash\r\nyour dirty linen at home.”\r\n\r\n_Nou (on) ne trâche (cherche) pas de la graïsse dans le nic (nid) d’ùn\r\ntchien (chien)._--No one thinks of looking for fat in a dog’s kennel.\r\nLook not for qualities where they are not likely to be found, as\r\ngenerosity in a miser, or honesty in a thief.\r\n\r\n_Si ùn cat (chat) s’amord (s’adonne) au lard, nou ne sairait (saurait)\r\nl’en d’s’amordre._--If a cat takes a liking for bacon you can’t break\r\nher of it. It is difficult to get rid of bad habits.\r\n\r\n_P’tit à p’tit l’ouaisé (oiseau) fait sen nic (nid)._--Little by little\r\nthe bird builds her nest. Rome was not built in a day.\r\n\r\n_Tout neû g’nêt (neuf balai) néquie (nettoie) net._--A new broom sweeps\r\nclean.\r\n\r\n_I’ n’y a itaïls (tels) que les féniêns (fainéants) quand i’ s’y\r\nmettent._--There are none like idlers when they once set to work.\r\n\r\n_Ch’est cauches (bas, chausses) grises, et grises cauches._--This is\r\nthe equivalent of the French proverb “C’est bonnet blanc, et blanc\r\nbonnet,” and the English, “Six of one, and half-a-dozen of the other.”\r\n\r\n_Ch’n’est pas les ciens (ceux) qui labourent le pûs près du fossaï (de\r\nla haie) qui sont les pûs riches._--It is not they who plough nearest\r\nthe hedge who are the richest. Economy may be carried too far.\r\n\r\n_I’ s’y entend coume à ramaïr (ramer) des chaoux (choux)._--He\r\nunderstands as much about it as about putting pea-sticks to cabbages.\r\nThe meaning conveyed being: he knows nothing at all about it.\r\n\r\n_Tout chu (ce) qui vient de flot se retournera d’èbe._--All that\r\ncomes with the flood will return with the ebb. Riches too rapidly\r\nacquired, or ill-gotten, will disappear as quickly as they came--nearly\r\nequivalent to the French proverb “Ce qui vient de la flûte s’en va par\r\nle tambour.”\r\n\r\n_Si l’houme aïme autre mûx que sé (mieux que soi) au moulìn i’ mourra\r\nde set (soif)._--If a man loves others more than himself, he will die\r\nof thirst even were he in a mill. The mill spoken of in this selfish\r\nproverb, which is equivalent to “Look after number one,” is, of course,\r\na water-mill.\r\n\r\n_Biauture (beau-temps, beauté) d’hiver; santaï (santé) de vieil homme;\r\nparole de gentilhomme; ne t’y fie, homme!_--A fine day in winter, the\r\nhealth of an old man, the word of a nobleman; trust to none of these,\r\nO man! The marked distinction of “noble” and “rôturier,” if such ever\r\nexisted in Guernsey, died out many centuries ago; and this proverb has\r\nall the appearance of an importation from Normandy, or some other part\r\nof France, where the peasantry were oppressed by the feudal system. The\r\nword “biauture” does not belong to the Guernsey dialect, and when the\r\nsaying is quoted in the present, it is generally with reference to the\r\ntwo first clauses.\r\n\r\n_Un tchien (chien) vaut bien p’tit qui ne vaut pas ùn caoup de sufflet\r\n(coup de sifflet)._--A dog that is not worth whistling for is not worth\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n_Les grands diseurs sont de p’tits faiseurs._--Great talkers are little\r\ndoers.\r\n\r\n_Où ’est qu’il y a du crottin, il y a du lapìn._--Where you see their\r\ndroppings, you may expect to find rabbits. Used both literally and\r\nmetaphorically. There is no smoke without fire.\r\n\r\n_Il y a terjoûs (toujours) un épi qui mànque à la guerbe\r\n(gerbe)._--There is always a spike of corn lacking in the sheaf.\r\nNothing is ever perfect.\r\n\r\n_I’ n’y a bouais (bois) dont non (on) n’fait buche._--There is no wood\r\nbut what will serve for firing, meaning that everything can be put to\r\nsome use or other; but the latter half of the proverb is sometimes\r\nvaried to “_dont i’ n’ fait buche_,” and it is then equivalent to the\r\nEnglish saying “All is fish that comes to his net.”\r\n\r\n_Va où tu peux, meurs où tu deis (dois)._--Go where you can, die where\r\nyou must. Dispose of your life as you please, death is inevitable.\r\n\r\n_Il est niais coume Dadais qui se couachait (couchait) dans l’iaue\r\n(eau) d’paeur (peur) d’être mouailli (mouillé)._--He is as foolish as\r\nDadais who lay down in the water to avoid getting wet in a shower.\r\n\r\n_Il est niais coume Dadais qui tâte l’iaue pour vée (voir) s’a bouit\r\n(bout)._--He is as stupid as Dadais who puts his hand into the water to\r\nfeel if it is boiling.\r\n\r\n_Il est pûs (plus) niais que Dadais qui se fouittait de\r\ncrêpes._[256]--He is more simple than Dadais who flogged himself with\r\npancakes. The word “Dadais” is used in the sense of simpleton. In the\r\nthree sayings that we have just quoted “Dadais” bears a strong family\r\nresemblance to the “Simple Simons” and “Silly Billies” of English\r\nnursery tales.\r\n\r\n_Ch’tait du temps du Rouai (Roi) Jehan. Ch’était du temps des\r\nScots._--Are used in speaking of events which took place beyond the\r\nmemory of man. It is easy to understand how the reign of King John\r\ncame to form an epoch in the history of Guernsey; for it was then that\r\nthe connexion with the mother-country, Normandy, was severed, and the\r\nislands, until then part and parcel of that Duchy, became attached to\r\nthe Crown of England, and have so continued ever since. But it is not\r\nso easy to say when or how the latter saying originated. It may refer\r\nto an invasion of the island by David Bruce, about the tenth year of\r\nEdward III., (A.D. 1336); when great atrocities appear to have been\r\ncommitted on the inhabitants; but some old people seem to think--and\r\nprobably with reason--that the “Scots” were a Scotch regiment sent here\r\nin the early part of last century on a fear of hostilities breaking out\r\nbetween England and France. It is right, however, to notice that in the\r\nGuernsey dialect “_Ecossais_” and not “_Scots_” is used to designate\r\nScotchmen.\r\n\r\n_I’ mànge coum’ un varou._--He eats like an ogre, is the exact English\r\nequivalent of this saying; but there are few who use the saying who\r\ncould say what is meant by “_un varou_.” It is, undoubtedly, the same\r\nas the French “loup-garou” in English--a were-wolf; and may have\r\nreference to the old superstition of men and women being turned into\r\nwolves.\r\n\r\n_I’ s’en est allaï (allé) les pids (pieds) d’vànt._--He has gone feet\r\nforemost. He has been carried to his grave.\r\n\r\n_Il a étaï enterraï la tête ès tchiens (aux chiens) dehors._--Is used\r\nin the same sense as “being buried like a dog.”\r\n\r\n_Il a tête et bounet (bonnet)._--He has a head, yea, and a cap, is said\r\nof an opinionated man.\r\n\r\n_I’ n’en reste ni tchiesse (cuisse) ni aïle._--There neither remains\r\nleg nor wing. All is lost, nothing remains.\r\n\r\n_I’ quient (tient) d’la chouque (souche)._--He’s a chip of the old\r\nblock.\r\n\r\n_I’ fait rille (raie) de gras._--He is making a streak of fat, is said\r\nof a man who is prospering in his affairs, in allusion to a pig that is\r\nbeing fattened.\r\n\r\n_I’ peut mànger sa gâche (galette) dorâïe (beurrée) des daeux bords\r\n(des deux côtés)._--He can eat his cake buttered on both sides. He is\r\nrich enough not to be obliged to spare himself any indulgence.\r\n\r\n_I’ mànge sa dorâie (tranche de pain beurré) grajie (grattée)._--He\r\nspares the butter on his bread, either from poverty or from avarice. It\r\nis “bread and scrape.”\r\n\r\n_I’ prend les cauches (chausses, bas,) pour les sôlers (souliers)._--He\r\nmistakes the stockings for the shoes. He is a blunderer who does not\r\nknow one thing from another.\r\n\r\n_Il a paeux (peur) des p’tits sôlers (souliers)._--He is afraid of\r\nthe little shoes, is said of a man who is unwilling to enter into\r\nthe estate of matrimony for fear of the additional expenses that it\r\nwill entail--shoes for the children being a considerable item in the\r\ndisbursements of a poor family.\r\n\r\n_I’ n’en prend ni compte ni taille._--He takes no account nor tally. He\r\nlets matters take their course.\r\n\r\n_V’là une fière perruque à débouquèr (démêler)._--There’s a fine wig to\r\ncomb out! Is said of an affair which is almost hopelessly involved.\r\n\r\n_Il a fait pertus (pertuis, trou) sous l’iaue (eau)._--He has made\r\na hole in the water. He has disappeared furtively. Compare with the\r\nFrench saying “Il a fait un trou à la lune.”\r\n\r\n_I’ vêt (voit) sept lieues dans la brune._--He sees seven leagues\r\nthrough the fog, is said derisively of a man who boasts of being more\r\nclearsighted than his neighbours.\r\n\r\n_Il est montaï (monté) sur ses pontificaux._--He is in his pontificals,\r\nis equivalent to the English saying “He is riding the high\r\nhorse,”--asserting his dignity when there is no need to do so.\r\n\r\n_Ch’est le bouâine (borgne) qui mène l’aveuglle._--The one-eyed man is\r\nleading the blind man.\r\n\r\n_Nou (on) ne saït pouit (point) où il puche (puise)._--One knows not\r\nwhat well he draws from, is said of a man who manages to get on without\r\nany very visible means of existence.\r\n\r\n_Trop de cuisiniers gâtent la soupe._--Too many cooks spoil the broth.\r\n\r\n_I’ n’y a pas de rue sàns but._--There is no road but has an ending.\r\nEquivalent to “It is a long lane that has no turning.”\r\n\r\n_S’il y avait un démarieur, il airait (aurait) pûs (plus) à faire que\r\ntous les marieurs._--If there were an “un-marryer” he would have more\r\nwork to do than all the “marryers.”\r\n\r\n_Ce n’est pas tout que les chaous, faut de la graîsse à les\r\ncuire._--Cabbages alone are not sufficient, one must have grease to\r\ncook them with. Generally applied to “_parvenus_,” who have money but\r\nno manners.\r\n\r\n_Nou’ n’engraisse pouit les p’tits cochons d’iau fine._--Little pigs\r\nare not fattened by pure water.\r\n\r\n_Vieille pie a plus d’un pertus à son nic (nid)._--An old magpie has\r\nmore than one hole in her nest. Said of a man who is skilful at evasion.\r\n\r\n_T’as acouare les jaunes talons._--You have still got yellow heels, is\r\nsaid to youngsters who are too presuming in giving their opinion in the\r\npresence of their elders. Compare the French “blanc-bec” and “béjaune.”\r\n\r\n_Ch’est la vermeïne (vermine) qui mànge (mange) l’tâs (le tas)._--It\r\nis the vermin that eats up the stack. Said of a father who has a large\r\nfamily of children drawing upon him and eating up all his savings.\r\n\r\n[256] EDITOR’S NOTE.--The version I have heard of this proverb is: “Il\r\nest niais coume Dadais qui se fouittait de crêpes et tout-le-temps\r\nmourait de faim.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPopular Sayings.\r\n\r\nThere are certain popular sayings which contain a comparison, and\r\nwhich, although in a strict sense they cannot be called proverbs,\r\nmay yet be classed with them. Some of these contain words which have\r\nbecome obsolete, or, at least, antiquated. “_Vier (vieux) comme suée_”\r\nequivalent to “As old as the hills,” may be quoted as an example,\r\nfor not only is the word “_suée_” obsolete, but its very meaning is\r\nforgotten and unknown. Mr. George Métivier, a learned philologist,\r\nauthor of the _Dictionnaire Franco-Normand, ou Recueil des Mots\r\nparticuliers au Dialecte de Guernesey_, is inclined to refer it to\r\nthe old French _suée_ signifying _sueur_, sweat, used in the sense of\r\nlabour. The conjecture is ingenious, but not quite satisfactory.\r\n\r\n_I’ s’est maniaï (manié) coume un albroche._--He has conducted himself\r\nlike a boor. Roquefort in his “_Glossaire de la Langue Romane_”\r\nexplains the word _Allobroge_ as “un homme grossier, un rustre, etc.,”\r\nand gives _Adlobrius_, _Allobrox_, as the Latin forms. According\r\nto Ducange, these words signify a citizen or native of Gaul. The\r\nAllobroges, however, in the time of the Roman Empire, were the tribes\r\ninhabiting Savoy and Piedmont.\r\n\r\n_I’ bét (boit) coume ùn alputre._--Is used in the sense of “He drinks\r\nlike a fish,” but why the _alputre_,--rockling, or sea-loach,--should\r\nbe singled out among fishes for bibulous propensities, it is impossible\r\nto guess.\r\n\r\n_I’ plleut coume cis (chez) Pierre de Garis._--Is used in the sense\r\nof “raining cats and dogs.” A certain Pierre de Garis, a merchant of\r\nBayonne, in the time when Aquitaine was governed by English Princes,\r\nwas appointed to the responsible office of Bailiff of Guernsey, about\r\nthe year 1325.[257] In all probability he derived his name from a\r\nsmall town called _Garis_, about half-way between Bayonne and St.\r\nJean-de-Luz. He became the founder of a family of importance, not only\r\nin Guernsey, but also in the neighbouring island of Jersey, and of\r\nwhich there are still numerous descendants. It is not very likely that\r\nthe saying dates so far back as the fourteenth century, although it\r\nhas no doubt a very respectable antiquity. We can only conjecture that\r\nit must have derived its origin from some well-known Pierre de Garis\r\nof indolent or miserly habits, who allowed the roof of his dwelling to\r\nfall into decay and let in the rain, and so became a by-word with his\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n_Ill’ y en a assaï (assez) pour tous les Tostevins._--There is\r\nenough for all the Tostevins--is said when there is an abundance of\r\nanything--enough and to spare. The name is extremely common in the\r\nwestern parishes of Guernsey, especially in St. Pierre-du-Bois and\r\nTorteval, where many of those who bear it are stone-masons who walk\r\nevery day into town--a distance of five or six miles--to their work.\r\nPerhaps the good appetite they acquire in so long a walk may have had\r\nsomething to do in originating the saying.\r\n\r\n_Jaune coume q’zette._--As yellow as a daffodil, is equivalent to the\r\nEnglish saying “As yellow as crow’s foot.” It is sometimes varied to\r\n“_jaune coume du murlu_,” this last word being the local name of the\r\ncorn-marigold and the ox-eye daisy.\r\n\r\n_Vert coume ache._--As green as smallage--a herb closely allied to\r\ncelery and parsley, and, like them, intensely green--is used where we\r\nshould say in English “As green as grass.”\r\n\r\n_Chièr (cher) coume paivre (poivre)._--As dear as pepper, is a\r\ncomparison which must have originated when this useful condiment,\r\nnow within the reach of the poorest, was a luxury brought from far\r\nand obtainable only by the rich. Quit-rents payable in pepper were\r\nnot unknown in the middle-ages; and in the Extente, or account of\r\nthe revenues and obligations of the Crown in Guernsey, drawn up in\r\nthe fifth year of the reign of King Edward III., A.D. 1331, there\r\nis an item of a quarter of a pound of pepper to be paid annually\r\nat Michaelmas, by a tenant of lands situated in the parish of St.\r\nMartin’s. The money payment for which this rent was commuted at that\r\ntime was twelve deniers tournois, which would make the value of a pound\r\nfour sols tournois, no inconsiderable sum in those days.\r\n\r\n_I’ chànte coume ùn orateur._--He sings like an orator. A loud voice\r\nis certainly desirable in one who attempts to _speak_ in public. Our\r\ncountrymen seem to consider it equally necessary and admirable in a\r\n_singer_.\r\n\r\n_Orguillaeux (orgueilleux) coume ùn pouâis (pou) sûs v’louss\r\n(velours)._--As proud as that insect which Shakespeare calls “a\r\nfamiliar beast to man” may be supposed to feel when it finds itself on\r\nvelvet.\r\n\r\n_Caûd (chaud) coume braïze._--As hot as embers, needs no explanation.\r\n\r\n_Ch’est coume un bourdon dans une canne._--It is like a humble bee in a\r\ncan--is said of a droning monotonous style of preaching or speaking.\r\n\r\n_Ch’est coume les prières de Jacques Ozanne qui n’ont pas de fin._--It\r\nis like James Ozanne’s prayers which never come to an end. This is said\r\nof any matter which is prolonged to an unreasonable extent; but nothing\r\nseems now to be known of the individual whose lengthy supplications\r\ngave rise to the saying.\r\n\r\n_T’es coume Jean Le Tocq._--You are like Jean Le Tocq. This is\r\naddressed to a man who is seen abroad at an earlier hour than usual,\r\nand contains an allusion to two lines in the old Guernsey ballad of the\r\ninvasion of the island by Evan of Wales in 1373, where it is said:--\r\n\r\n    _“Jean Le Tocq sy se leva_\r\n    _Plus matin qu’a l’accoutumée.”_\r\n\r\nIndeed this last line is generally added.\r\n\r\n_Il a la conscience de la jument Rabey qui mangit s’en poulâin._--He\r\nhas the conscience of Rabey’s mare, who ate her foal. Said of an\r\nutterly hard-hearted and unscrupulous man. The Rabeys are a well-known\r\ncountry family, and it is possible that this proverb refers to some\r\ndomestic tragedy, the details of which have long been forgotten.\r\n\r\n_Avoir le corset de Maître George._--To wear the corset of Maître\r\nGeorge. An allusion is here meant to a certain George Fénien. The\r\nFéniens were a family who owned property in Fountain Street, and seem\r\nto have become extinct towards the middle of the eighteenth century.\r\nThis expression is applied to an indolent man, so that the “Maître\r\nGeorge Fénien”[258] here alluded to must have lived up to his name,\r\nFénien--Fainéant--a sluggard. We have seen in some of the preceding\r\nproverbs and sayings, allusions to individuals and families. Here are\r\ntwo or three more of the same kind:--\r\n\r\n_I’ fait de sen Quéripel._--Is untranslatable literally, but may be\r\nrendered “he acts like a Quéripel.” and is said of a man whose vanity\r\nleads him to give himself airs, and take too much upon himself. The\r\nname existed in Guernsey as early as the fourteenth century, at which\r\ntime it was written _Carupel_, but there is not the slightest clue when\r\nor how the saying originated. It may possibly be a corruption of some\r\nproverbial expression current in Normandy.\r\n\r\n_Il est dans les Arabies de Mons. Roland._--“He has got into Mr.\r\nRoland’s Arabias,” is a remark made when a preacher, a public speaker,\r\nor any one who sets up for a talker, has got beyond his depth, and is\r\ndiscoursing on a subject which he does not understand. The Rolands, now\r\nextinct, are believed to have been a Huguenot family that took refuge\r\nin Guernsey in the sixteenth century.[259] The Mons^{r}. Roland who\r\nfigures in the saying is supposed to have been a schoolmaster.[260]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Guernsey House.]\r\n\r\n_Ch’est prendre de Pierre Chyvret pour dounaïr à Monsieur Careye._--“It\r\nis taking from Pierre Chyvret to give to Mr. Carey,” is used in the\r\nsense of “sending coals to Newcastle,” or “taking from the poor to\r\ngive to the rich;” but who the particular individuals were whose names\r\nfigure in this saying it is impossible to say. In the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth a Mr. Nicholas Careye was farmer of most, if not all, the\r\nmills in Guernsey situated on the Crown domain, he being then Her\r\nMajesty’s Receiver. At a time when all persons residing on a manor\r\nwere obliged to bring their corn to be ground at their Lord’s mill,\r\nunder severe penalties, such a monopoly in the mills as Mr. Carey\r\npossessed, must have tended to make him a very wealthy man.[261] It\r\nis not unlikely that he, or one of his immediate descendants, who\r\nenjoyed the same privilege, may have been the person whose name became\r\nproverbial for riches. The name of Peter Chyvret occurs in another\r\nsaying too coarse to be quoted, but which suggests the idea that he\r\nmay have been an idiot, and, if so, probably living on charity. It\r\nis, however, worth noting that a certain Peter Chyvret was, about the\r\nbeginning of the present century, in possession of property situated\r\nin the neighbourhood of one of the mills of which we have spoken. He\r\nis reported to have been one of those eccentric characters of whom it\r\nis difficult to say whether they have all their mental faculties--a\r\nmixture, in fact, of shrewdness and simplicity. As he was by no means\r\nin indigent circumstances it is scarcely probable that he can be the\r\nsame man alluded to in this saying.\r\n\r\n_Tenir à pìnche-beleïne._--Means to hold lightly, without a firm grasp.\r\nIt is used in the following proverbial saying:--\r\n\r\n    _“A pìnche-beleïne--sû la haute épeine,_\r\n    _Si je m’déroque--je n’en dirai mot.”_\r\n\r\n--Which may be freely translated:--“Holding on too lightly, if I fall\r\nfrom the tree I shall say nothing about it.” If I suffer from my own\r\nnegligence I must not complain.\r\n\r\n[257] EDITOR’S NOTE. The following short pedigree of the first members\r\nof the de Garis family in the island may prove interesting:--It is\r\nextracted from the proceedings of the law suit re the Fief Handois in\r\n1497.

In the “Calendars of Patent Rolls” for the years\r\n1328-36, we find Nicholaa, Abbess of the Holy Trinity, Caen, nominating\r\nPeter and William de Garis her Attorneys in the Channel Islands, and in\r\n1332 a Commission was given to Robert de Norton, William de la Rue, and\r\nPeter de Garis to survey the King’s Castles and Mills in the islands of\r\nJersey and Guernsey which are reported to be greatly in need of repair,\r\nand to certify by whose default, and by whom they fell into decay. In\r\n1380, a William de Garis, described as being “de l’isle de Guerneseye,”\r\nsold to “Sire Pierre Payn” the Manor of Malorey in St. Laurent, Jersey,\r\nto which parish the Fief Handois also belonged.\r\n\r\n[258] EDITOR’S NOTE.--A “George Fenien” was in existence at the end of\r\nthe sixteenth century, and his daughter Collette Fenien, was married to\r\nWilliam Brock, ancestor of the Brocks of Guernsey. William Brock died\r\nin 1582.\r\n\r\n[259] EDITOR’S NOTE.--In the “Placita Coronæ” held in the reign of\r\nEdward III., William, son of Robert Roland, held land in the Vale\r\nparish. In a deed of 23rd of August, 1517, dealing with land in St.\r\nSampson’s parish, south of the “Grand Pont” the “_Rue Roland_” is\r\nmentioned; in 1569, there was living in St. Sampson’s parish a Richard\r\nRoland and Collenette Le Retylley, his wife, and (2nd November, 1569)\r\nThomas Roland and Jeanne Blondel, his wife, bought a house in St. Peter\r\nPort from Jean Le Montés; so the probabilities are that the Rolands, if\r\nthey migrated from France, did so before the Huguenot persecutions, and\r\nhad been domiciled in Guernsey long anterior to the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[260] EDITOR’S NOTE.--Or he may have been the “Monsieur Jean\r\nRoland,” son of Thomas and Elizabeth Bailleul, who was Rector of S.\r\nPierre-du-Bois, and imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1665, for his\r\nrefusal to submit to the Act of Uniformity.\r\n\r\n[261] EDITOR’S NOTE.--It was this Monsieur Careye, who in September,\r\n1563, bought the Fief Blanchelande from Her Majesty’s Commissioners; he\r\nmarried Collette de la Marche and was buried 15th of July, 1593.\r\n\r\n\r\nProverbial Sayings.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a class of proverbial sayings which might almost claim\r\nan exclusive right to the title of “Folk-Lore,”--those relating to the\r\nweather and other natural phenomena; and which, being the result of\r\nlong experience on the part of the people, are religiously believed in\r\nby them. Many of these sayings are common, in spirit if not in form,\r\nto the greater part of Europe; some of them are confined to certain\r\ndistricts; and, although a few may have a superstitious aspect, such as\r\nthose which profess to predict what events will happen in the course of\r\nthe year from an observation of the weather on a particular holy day,\r\nyet some of them may be worthy the notice of meteorologists, who have\r\ndiscovered that, in many cases, the probable character of the weather\r\nin a particular month may be guessed at by that which prevailed at an\r\nearlier season.\r\n\r\n_Janvier a daeux bouniaux (deux bonnets), Février en a treis\r\n(trois)._--January wears two caps, February wears three. As a rule\r\nFebruary is the coldest month in the year. In a curious old MS. of the\r\nsixteenth century, containing memoranda of household accounts, copies\r\nof wills, and various entries of more or less interest, written between\r\nthe years 1505 and 1569 by various members of a family of the name\r\nof Girard, landed proprietors in the parish of Ste. Marie-du-Castel\r\nin Guernsey, we find the following weather prognostications for St.\r\nVincent’s Day (January 22nd), and the Feast of the Conversion of St.\r\nPaul, (January 25th).\r\n\r\n    _“Prens garde au jour St. Vincent_\r\n    _Car sy se jour tu vois et sent_\r\n    _Que le soleil soiet cler et biau_\r\n    _Nous érons du vin plus que d’eau.”_\r\n\r\n    _“Sy le jour St. Paul le convers_\r\n    _Se trouve byaucob descouvert,_\r\n    _L’on aura pour celle sayson_\r\n    _Du bled et du foyn à foyson;_\r\n    _Et sy se jour fait vant sur terre;_\r\n    _Ce nous synyfye guerre;_\r\n    _S’yl pleut ou nège, sans fallir,_\r\n    _Le chier tans nous doet asalir;_\r\n    _Sy de nyelle faict, brumes ou brouillars,_\r\n    _Selon le dyt de nos vyellars,_\r\n    _Mortalitey nous est ouverte.”_\r\n\r\nSimilar sayings are to be found in Latin, English, German, Italian, and\r\nother languages.\r\n\r\nFebruary, as every one knows, is the shortest month in the year;\r\nbut few know why. This is how it is accounted for by old people in\r\nGuernsey:--“_Février dit à Janvier:--‘Si j’étais à votre pièche\r\n(place) je f’rais gelaïr (geler) les pots sus le faeu (feu) et les\r\np’tits éfàns (enfants) aux seins de leurs mères’--et pour son ìmpudence\r\ni’ fut raccourchi (raccourci) de daeux jours, et Janvier fut aloigni\r\n(alongé).‘_” February said to January:--If I were in your place I would\r\ncause the pots to freeze on the fire, and babes at their mothers’\r\nbreasts, and for his insolence he was shortened of two days, and\r\nJanuary was lengthened.\r\n\r\nThe most intense cold in the year generally sets in with February; and\r\nthis saying reminds me of what is told in Scotland, and in many parts\r\nof the north of England, of the _borrowing days_, the three last days\r\nof March (See Brand’s _Popular Antiquities_, Bohn’s edition, Vol. II.,\r\np. 41-44). It appears, however, according to this authority, that in\r\nthe Highlands of Scotland the _borrowing days_ are the three first days\r\nof February, reckoned according to the old style, that is, the days\r\nbetween the eleventh and the fifteenth.\r\n\r\nFebruary 2nd, Candlemas Day. Fine weather on this day is supposed to\r\nprognosticate a return of cold. The following lines were communicated\r\nby a country gentleman, but they have not quite the same antique ring\r\nas those relating to St. Paul’s and St. Vincent’s Days, and may,\r\npossibly, be a more recent importation from France.\r\n\r\n    _“Selon les anciens se dit:_\r\n    _Si le soleil clairement luit_\r\n    _A’ la Chandeleur vous verrez_\r\n    _Qu’ encore un hiver vous aurez.”_\r\n\r\n_Quànd Mars durerait chent àns l’hiver durerait autànt._--If March were\r\nto last for a hundred years, winter would last as long.\r\n\r\n_Mars qui entre coume ùn agné (agneau) sortira coume ùn touaré\r\n(taureau)._--The Guernsey form of this saying substitutes a bull in the\r\nplace of a lion.\r\n\r\n_Mars a enviaï (envoyé) sa vieille trachier (chercher) des bûquettes\r\n(buchettes)._--When, after a spell of comparatively mild weather, March\r\ncomes with blustering winds, breaking off the small dry branches from\r\nthe trees, the country people say that he has sent out his old wife to\r\nlook for sticks; and predict that, as he is laying in a store of fuel,\r\nthe cold is likely to last.\r\n\r\n_Pâques Martine--guerre, peste, ou famine._--Easter happening in March,\r\nforebodes war, pestilence, or famine.\r\n\r\n_A Noué à ses perrons, à Pâques à ses tisons._--If at Christmas you can\r\nsit at your doorstep, at Easter you will be glad to sit by your fire.\r\n\r\n_Avril le doux--quànd il s’y met le pière de tous._--Or, as the\r\nNorman antiquary, Pluquet, gives it:--“_Quand il se fâche, le pire de\r\ntous_.”--When the weather is bad in April, it is the worst of all the\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n_En Avril, ne quitte pas ùn fil._--In April leave not off a stitch of\r\nclothing--a piece of advice which is well warranted by the sudden and\r\nextreme changes in the temperature in this month. On the other side,\r\nthis advice holds good a month later--“Till May be out cast not a\r\nclout.”\r\n\r\n_Caud (chaud) Mai, gras chimequière (cimetière), fred (froid) Mai,\r\ngranges pllaïnes (pleines)._--A warm May, a fat churchyard, a cold May,\r\nfat granaries.\r\n\r\n_A’ la mié Août, l’hiver noue._--About mid-August there is usually a\r\nmarked change in the weather, gales of wind and heavy rain generally\r\noccurring at this season, and any long continuance of settled fine\r\nweather, is scarcely to be hoped for. This has led to the remark that\r\nwinter “_sets_” at this time; as the blossoms in Spring set for fruit.\r\n\r\n_A’ la mi-S’tembre, les jours et les nits s’entre ressemblent._--In the\r\nmiddle of September, days and nights are alike.\r\n\r\n_Six s’maïnes avant Noué, et six s’maïnes après, les nits sont les pûs\r\nlongues, et les jours les pûs freds._--Six weeks before Christmas and\r\nsix weeks after, the nights are the longest and the days the coldest.\r\nThis saying is scarcely correct in Guernsey, as very cold weather about\r\nthe end or the beginning of the year is rather the exception than the\r\nrule in this climate.\r\n\r\n_Si le soleil liet à méjeur, le jour de Noué, il y aura bien des faeux\r\nl’annaïe ensuivant._--If the sun shines at noon on Christmas Day, there\r\nwill be many fires lighted in the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_Aube gelaïe est biétôt lavaïe._--Hoar-frost is soon washed away, or,\r\nas another weather proverb says:--“_Après treis aubes gelaïes vient la\r\npllie._”--After three hoar-frosts comes rain, a saying which experience\r\namply bears out.\r\n\r\n_Vent d’amont qui veur duraïr, au sér va se reposaïr._--An east wind\r\nthat intends to last, goes to rest in the evening.\r\n\r\n_Vent d’amont ôve (avec) pllie, ne vaut pas un fllie (patelle)._--An\r\neast wind with rain is not worth a limpet.\r\n\r\n_Quand i’ plleut ôve vent d’amont, ch’est merveille si tout ne\r\nfond._--Rain from the east is rare; but when it does occur it is so\r\nheavy and continuous as to give rise to the saying that it is a wonder\r\nthat everything does not melt.\r\n\r\n_Cherne (cerne) à la lune, le vent, la pllie, ou la brune._--When\r\nthere’s a circle round the moon, wind, rain, or fog, will follow soon.\r\n\r\n_Cherne de llien (loin), tourmente de près; cherne de près, tourmente\r\nde llien._--If the halo round the moon is large and at a distance, it\r\ndenotes that a storm is at hand, if, on the contrary, it is small and\r\nnear the moon, the storm will not arrive for some time.\r\n\r\n_Cherne à la lune, jamais n’a fait amenaïr mât d’hune._--A circle round\r\nthe moon has never caused top-mast to be struck. It is difficult to\r\nreconcile this saying with the preceding, unless by supposing that\r\nsailors are so convinced that a circle round the moon portends bad\r\nweather that they are careful to shorten sail before the gale comes on.\r\n\r\n_Cherne au soleil i’ ne fera pas demain bel._--A solar halo means bad\r\nweather to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    _Si le soleil est rouage (rouge) au sèr (soir),_\r\n    _Ch’est pour biau temps aver (avoir),_\r\n    _S’il est rouage au matin,_\r\n    _Ch’est la mare au chemin._\r\n\r\nIf the sun sets red, it is a sign of fine weather, but when he rises\r\nred, you may expect to see pools of water on the road.\r\n\r\n_Rouage ser, gris matin, ch’est la jouaie (joie) du pélerin._--A red\r\nevening and a grey morning are the pilgrim’s joy, but this saying is\r\nsometimes varied to:--\r\n\r\n_Rouage sèr, bllanc matin, ch’est la journaïe du pélerin._--A red\r\nevening and a white morning is the day for the pilgrim.\r\n\r\n_En Avril, le coucou crie, s’il est en vie._--In April, the cuckoo\r\nsings, if he is alive. The cuckoo generally arrives in Guernsey about\r\nthe 15th of April.\r\n\r\n    _Le cou-cou s’en va en Août,_\r\n    _L’épi d’orge li pique la gorge._\r\n\r\n    _The cuckoo departs in August,_\r\n    _The barley-spike pricks his throat._\r\n\r\n\r\nAgricultural Sayings.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to draw a clear line between those sayings which have\r\nreference to the weather, and those which relate to agricultural\r\npursuits and experience; but the following appear to fall more\r\nnaturally under the latter head:--\r\n\r\n    _Quànd i’ plleut ôve vent d’aval,_\r\n    _Nourrit l’houme et sen cheval;_\r\n    _Quànd i’ plleut ôve vent d’amont,_\r\n    _Ch’est merveille si tout ne fond._\r\n\r\nWhen it rains with a westerly wind it feeds man and beast; but when it\r\nrains with an east wind, it is a marvel if everything does not melt.\r\n\r\n    _L’arc d’alliance du soir, bel à voir,_\r\n    _L’arc d’alliance du matin, fait la mare à chemin._\r\n\r\nRainbow in the evening, fair to see; rainbow in the morning, there will\r\nbe pools on the roads.\r\n\r\n_Si tu vois le soleil le jour de la Chandeleur, sauve le foin, car tu\r\nen auras besoin._--If you see the sun on Candlemas Day, save your hay\r\nfor you will want it.\r\n\r\n_A’ la Paintecoûte, les grouaïsiaux se goûtent._--Green gooseberries\r\nare in perfection at Whitsuntide.\r\n\r\n_De la St. Michel à Noué (Noel) une pllante ne sait pas chu (ce) que\r\nnou (on) li fait._--From Michaelmas to Christmas a plant does not know\r\nwhat you do to it.\r\n\r\n_De la Toussaint à Noué un arbre ne sait pas chu que non li\r\nfait._--From All Saints’ Day to Christmas a tree knows not what is\r\ndone to it. The autumnal quarter is supposed to be the best for\r\ntransplanting trees or shrubs, as at that time the vigorous growth that\r\nhad been going on in spring and summer has ceased, and there is less\r\ndanger of their suffering from the change.\r\n\r\n_Noué n’est pas Noué sàns pâcrolle (paquerette primevère)._--Christmas\r\nis not Christmas unless there be primroses.\r\n\r\n_Noué est pûtôt Noué, sans pâcrolle, que sans agné (agneau)._--A\r\nChristmas without primroses is more rare than a Christmas without\r\nlambs. Another version is:--\r\n\r\n_Nou ne vit jamais Noué, sans pâcrolle ou p’tit agné._--This saying, as\r\nwell as the preceding, seems to refer particularly to the occurrence\r\nof that harbinger of spring, the primrose, at this season. With the\r\nexception occasionally of a few very cold days about the beginning\r\nof November, the weather in Guernsey up to Christmas, and frequently\r\nfar into January, is remarkably mild; vegetation is scarcely checked,\r\nand many summer flowers continue to bloom freely up to this time. It\r\nis a well-known fact that the primrose, like many other plants and\r\nmost bulbs, has its period of repose during the hot and dry weather\r\nof summer, the flowering ceasing about the end of May, and the leaves\r\nwithering away. In the autumn there is a fresh growth of leaves, and\r\nthe flower buds, which had been already formed towards the end of\r\nspring, but had been prevented by the drought from expanding, are\r\nready to burst into bloom with the mild days that generally usher in\r\nChristmas, the earliest blossoms being invariably found on the north\r\nsides of the hedges, where the latest flowers of the preceding summer\r\nlingered, the plants with a south aspect having exhausted their bloom\r\nin the hot weather.\r\n\r\n    _A flleur de Mars--ni pouque (poche) ni sac;_\r\n    _A flleur d’Avril--pouque et baril;_\r\n    _A flleur de Mai--barrique et touné (tonneau)._\r\n\r\n    Blossom in March requires neither bag nor sack;\r\n    Blossom in April fills bag and barrel;\r\n    Blossom in May fills hogshead and tun.\r\n\r\nThis saying refers to the apple crop, and the quantity of cider that\r\nmay be expected, judging from the month in which the trees come into\r\nbloom.\r\n\r\n    _Sème tes concombres en Mars,_\r\n    _Tu n’ airas qu’ faire de pouque ni de sac;_\r\n    _Sème-les en Avril, tu en airas ùn petit;_\r\n    _Mé, j’ les semerai en Mai;_\r\n    _Et j’en airai pûs que té (toi)._\r\n\r\nSow your cucumbers in March, you will want neither bag nor sack; sow\r\nthem in April, you will have a few; I will sow mine in May, and I shall\r\nhave more than you.\r\n\r\n_Pouit (point) de vraic, pouit de haugard._--No seaweed, no corn ricks.\r\nThe sea-weed, _vraic_ or _varech_, which grows in such abundance on\r\nall the rocks round the islands, is of the utmost importance to the\r\nfarmer. It is almost the only dressing used for the land, stable manure\r\nbeing scarce and expensive. Hence the saying quoted above; for without\r\nsufficient manure the crops are sure to fall short. The _haugard_,\r\nor, more correctly, _haut gard_, (high yard) is the enclosure near a\r\nhomestead on which the ricks are erected.\r\n\r\n_Débet (dégel) de pllie, ne vaut pas une fllie (patille); débet de sec,\r\nvaut demi-fumaeure (fumier)._--A thaw with rain is not worth a limpet;\r\na thaw with dry weather is worth half a load of manure.\r\n\r\n_Un essaim en Mai--vaut une vaque (vache) à lait._--A swarm of bees in\r\nMay is worth a milch cow.\r\n\r\n_Où est qu’ll y a un cardon (chardon) ch’est du pain; où est qu’ill y a\r\ndu laitron, ch’est la faim._--Where thistles grow there will be bread,\r\nwhere the sow-thistle grows it is famine. The latter is mostly found in\r\nvery poor land.\r\n\r\n_Il vaut mûx pour ùn houme d’aver un percheux (paresseux) dans son\r\nménage qu’un frêne sur s’n hêritage._--It is better for a man to have a\r\nlazy fellow in his service than an ash-tree on his estate. The shade of\r\nthe ash is believed to be destructive of all vegetation over which it\r\nextends; and it is this belief that has in all probability given rise\r\nto this saying. This proverb sometimes takes the following form:--\r\n\r\n    _Bâtard dans sen lignage_\r\n    _Vaut mûx qu’un frène sur s’n héritage._\r\n\r\n\r\nPiscatory and Maritime Sayings.\r\n\r\nThe following sayings may be termed piscatory and maritime.\r\n\r\n_A quànd le bœuf est las, le bar est gras._--When the ox is weary, that\r\nis, when ploughing has come to an end for the season, the bass is in\r\ngood condition. This fish is decidedly best in summer.\r\n\r\n_A quànd l’orge épicotte, le vrac est bouan sous la roque._--When the\r\nbarley comes into ear, the wrasse or rock-fish, is at its best.\r\n\r\n_L’âne de Balaam a pâlaï (parlé) j’airon du macré\r\n(maquereau)._--Balaam’s ass has spoken, we shall soon have mackerel.\r\nThe mackerel, it is almost needless to say, is a migratory fish,\r\narriving on our coasts in the spring, and remaining with us till late\r\nin the summer. Formerly the reading of the First Lesson at Evensong on\r\nthe first Sunday after Easter, in which the story of Balaam and his ass\r\nis told, was considered a sure indication that the welcome shoals would\r\nsoon make their appearance. The Cornish fishermen have the same saying.\r\n\r\nOld fishermen pay great attention to the direction of the wind at\r\nsunset on old Michaelmas Day (10th October), for they firmly believe\r\nthat from whatever point it blows at that time, the prevailing winds\r\nfor two-thirds of the ensuing twelve months will be from that quarter.\r\n\r\n    _Grànd maïr (mer) ou morte iaue (eau),_\r\n    _La lune au sud, il est basse iaue._\r\n\r\nWhether it be spring tides or neap tides, when the moon is due south it\r\nwill be low water.\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTE.--Another version: “Vive iaue ou morte iaue, La lune au\r\nsud, il est basse iaue.”--_From John de Garis, Esq._\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious Sayings.\r\n\r\nA few sayings omitted may find a place here:--\r\n\r\n_Alle ira sû le coquet de l’Eglise ramendaïr (racommoder) les\r\nbraies (culottes) des viers garçons._--She will get a seat on the\r\nweather-cock of the church and mend old bachelor’s breeches, is said of\r\nold maids, and is equivalent to the English saying, “She will lead apes\r\nin hell.”\r\n\r\n_Ch’est une autre pâre (paire) de cauches (bas, chausses)._--That’s\r\nanother pair of stockings, is used in the sense of “That’s quite\r\nanother affair.”\r\n\r\n_A quànd les filles suffllent (sifflent) le guiablle (diable)\r\ns’éhuque._--When girls whistle the devil laughs outright. Whistling\r\nis not generally reckoned among feminine accomplishments, and by many\r\nwould certainly be considered as a symptom of what, in the present day,\r\nis termed “fastness” in the fair sex.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Northamptonshire proverb:--\r\n\r\n    “A whistling woman and crowing hen,\r\n    Are neither fit for God nor men.”\r\n\r\nIn Normandy they say:--“Une poule qui chante le coquet, et une fille\r\nqui siffle, portent malheur dans la maison.”[262]\r\n\r\nAnd in Cornwall:--“A whistling woman and a crowing hen, are the two\r\nunluckiest things under the sun.”\r\n\r\n_Trachier (chercher) la Ville par Torteval._--To seek for the Town by\r\nway of Torteval, is said of one who goes a round-about way to work.\r\nThe rural parish of Torteval, situated at the south-west corner of\r\nGuernsey, is, of all the parishes in the island, the one furthest\r\nremoved from the town of St. Peter Port. Compare the French “Chercher\r\nmidi à quatorze heures.”\r\n\r\n_Il ôt (ouit, entend) fin coume une iragne (araignée)._--His sense of\r\nhearing is as quick as that of a spider. Whether the abrupt retreat\r\nof the common wall-spider into the inner recesses of its web, at the\r\napproach of anything that alarms it, is to be attributed to the sense\r\nof hearing, sight, or feeling, would be difficult to determine. The\r\nfact, however, has been noticed, and has given rise to this saying.\r\n\r\n    _Entre le bec et le morcé,_\r\n    _Ill y a souvent du destorbier._\r\n\r\n    T’wixt cup and lip--there’s many a slip.\r\n\r\n    _Qui épouse Jerriais ou Jerriaise,_\r\n    _Jamais ne vivra à s’n aise._\r\n\r\nIn all countries and in all ages jealousies and dislikes have existed\r\nbetween neighbouring communities. The inhabitants in Guernsey and\r\nJersey are not exempt from these feelings, which find vent in\r\nmalicious tales told of each other. The saying quoted above is common\r\nin Guernsey; probably its counterpart exists in Jersey, substituting\r\n“Guernesiais” for “Jerriais.” It by no means follows, however, that\r\nthe want of comfort in these mixed marriages may not be quite as\r\nattributable to the one side as the other.\r\n\r\n_Il y a terjoûs quiqu’ùn qui a sa qu’minse à sequier._--There is always\r\nsome one wanting to dry his shirt. The weather never suits everybody’s\r\nwants.\r\n\r\n_I’ n’a que vie d’alàngouraï (languissant)._--Equal to the English\r\nsaying “A creaking door hangs longest.”\r\n\r\n_Si un houme n’a pas le sens de pâlaïr (parler) il est bien sâge s’il a\r\nle sens de se taire._--A man who has not the sense to speak is still a\r\nwise man if he has the sense to hold his tongue.\r\n\r\n_I’ faut savèr ouïr, véer, et se taire._--One should know how to hear,\r\nsee, and be silent.\r\n\r\n_La s’maïne qui vient._--is the equivalent of the English “To-morrow\r\ncome-never.”\r\n\r\n_Chu qu’ nou n’a jamais veu, et jamais ne verra, Ch’est le nic\r\nd’une souaris dans l’oreille d’un cat._--In the _Folk-Lore Record_,\r\nVol. III., Part I., p. 76, we find the Breton equivalent of this\r\nsaying:--“One thing you have never seen, a mouse’s nest in a cat’s\r\near.” We are not told, however, whether the proverb is found in the\r\nFrench patois of Upper Brittany, or in the Celtic dialect still spoken\r\nin Lower Brittany--la Bretagne bretonnante.\r\n\r\n_I’ va d’vànt ses bêtes_, or _I’s’met d’vànt ses bêtes_.--He is going\r\nbefore his team, is said of a prodigal, one who is out-running his\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n_Ch’est une pouquie (pochée) de puches (puces)_ or _de souaris_.--Is a\r\nsackful of fleas, or of mice, is said of a person who is very lively\r\nand always on the move.\r\n\r\n_Il n’est si bouane (bonne) bête qui n’ait quiqu’ (quelque)\r\nohi._--There is no beast so good but that it has some fault or vice. It\r\nis worthy of notice that the word “_ohi_” is gone entirely out of use\r\nexcept in this proverb.\r\n\r\n_I’ vit d’amour et de belles chansons--coum’ les alouettes de roques\r\n(pierres, cailloux)._--The first part of this saying--He lives on love\r\nand fine songs--is frequently used alone, but it is often capped by the\r\nconcluding words, “As larks do on stones,” meaning that something more\r\nnourishing is needed to keep body and soul together.\r\n\r\n“_Un mouisson (oisseau) dans la main vaut mûx que daeux qui volent._”\r\n“_Un mouisson à la main en vaut daeux sur la branque (branche.)_” “_Un\r\npourché (pourceau) dans sen parc en vaut daeux d’ par les rues._”\r\nAll these are equivalent to the English proverb: “A bird in the hand\r\nis worth two in the bush,” but the last must have originated in days\r\nlong gone by, when swine were allowed to roam at their will about the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n_I’ n’ y a pas de cousins à Terre-Neuve._--There are no cousins at\r\nNewfoundland. This somewhat selfish proverb, indicating that where\r\none’s own interest is at stake the ties of consanguinity go for little,\r\nalthough occasionally heard in Guernsey, originated most probably\r\neither in Jersey or St. Malo, both which ports are largely engaged in\r\nthe cod fisheries on the banks of Newfoundland. Jersey, indeed, owes\r\nher commercial prosperity almost entirely to this branch of industry,\r\nto which, it is said, the attention of the inhabitants was directed by\r\nSir Walter Raleigh during the time that he held the office of Governor\r\nof the island. During the Middle Ages the fisheries in the Channel\r\nIslands were very productive, and a source of considerable revenue to\r\nthe Crown, but the discovery of Newfoundland, and the superior quality\r\nof the codfish caught on its shores, drove the salted conger and\r\nmackerel of the island out of the market.\r\n\r\n_Le cul d’un sac et la langue d’une femme gagnent terjoûs._--In former\r\ndays, when horses were more employed in carrying loads than they are at\r\nthe present time when carts are in universal use, it was observed that\r\na sack thrown across the back of a horse had a tendency to slip down\r\ngradually in the direction opposite to its mouth. This explains the\r\nfirst part of the proverb; the second part is equivalent to the saying\r\nthat a woman will always have the last word and gain her end at last.\r\n\r\n_Nou veit bien pûs de meïnes de gâche crue que de biaux musiaux._--One\r\nsees many more pasty, doughy looking faces than pretty ones. Said in\r\nvery cold weather.\r\n\r\n_Ch’n’est que faeu et fllâmme._--It is nothing but fire and flame, said\r\nof a boaster, and also of a passionate man, whose temper quickly rises,\r\nand as quickly dies down.\r\n\r\n_Pêle-mêle gabouaré._--Pell-mell, as merry-makers tumble out of\r\na village inn. This word “gabouaré,” derived from the Bas Breton\r\n“_gaborel_,” is only found in this phrase.\r\n\r\n_Il est coume le pourché du negre, petit et vier._--He is small and\r\nold, like the negro’s pig.\r\n\r\n_Cope le cô_, _i.e._, “coupe le cou,” is a common asseveration among\r\nchildren. They pronounce the words, drawing their right hand at the\r\nsame time towards their throat, as if cutting it, and the action is\r\nmeant to imply that they wish their throats may be cut if they do not\r\ntell the truth, or perform what they have promised.\r\n\r\n_Vaque (vache) d’un bouan égrùn (croissance)._--A cow that does credit\r\nto her food, and that feeds close. _Etre d’un bouan égrùn_--is also\r\nsaid of children who look fat and healthy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we will give a story which is often told in the country,\r\nas a warning to those who are apt to laugh at fools. A half-witted\r\nfellow, who had gone to the mill with his corn, was asked by the\r\nmiller, who wanted to laugh at him:--“John, people say that you are a\r\nfool and know nothing. Now, tell me what you know and what you don’t\r\nknow?” “Well!” answered John, “I know this, that millers have fine\r\nhorses.” “That’s what you know,” said the miller. “Now tell me what you\r\ndon’t know.” “I don’t know on whose corn they are fattened,” said John.\r\n\r\n--_From Denys Corbet._\r\n\r\n[262] EDITOR’S NOTE.--In _Traditions et Superstitions de la Haute\r\nBretagne_, Tome II., p. 29., are various sayings to the same effect,\r\nsuch as:--\r\n\r\n    “Fille siffler,\r\n    Poule chanter,\r\n    Et coq qui pond,\r\n    Trois diables dans la maison.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gibbet from which pirates were suspended in the Island\r\nof Herm, now in possession of H.S.H. Prince Blücher von Wahlstatt, who\r\nkindly allowed it to be photographed for reproduction in this book.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S NOTES.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few local proverbs and sayings which I have met\r\nwith at different times, and which I do not find included in Sir Edgar\r\nMacCulloch’s collection.\r\n\r\n_Il est si avare, il ne dounera pouit daeux p’tits œufs pour un\r\ngros._--He is such a miser that he would not give two little eggs for\r\none big one.\r\n\r\n_Coume St. Paterne, tu feras pâlir le Diable._--Like St. Paterne, you\r\nwould turn the Devil pale, said of a man whom nothing will daunt. St.\r\nPaterne was one of our local saints, who was specially noted for the\r\nconversion of the inhabitants of the Forest of Scissy--the submerged\r\nforest which lies off our western coasts. He was induced to do so by a\r\npious Seigneur of the Forest, and began his work there by going into\r\na cavern where the idolaters were celebrating a great feast presided\r\nover by the Devil himself. Armed only with his pilgrim’s staff he\r\nrouted them all, Satan included. He was specially beloved by birds, who\r\nfollowed him wherever he went. He was made Bishop of Avranches, and\r\ndied in the year A.D. 495.\r\n\r\n_La s’maïne de treis (trois) Jeudis ou il n’ y a pas de Vendredi._--The\r\nweek of three Thursdays and no Friday. This is used when talking of an\r\nevent which will never come off. Then they say “Ca, se fera, etc.”\r\n\r\n_Haut coumme un béguin._--As high as a beacon. The Guernsey “béguins”\r\nwere tall stacks of furze placed on prominent points so that they could\r\nbe lit in case of an alarm.\r\n\r\n_Ecoute-paret (paroi) jamais n’ot dret._--He who listens through\r\npartitions never hears correctly.\r\n\r\n_Faire pertus (trou) sous l’iaue._--To make a hole in the water, said\r\nof a man who is ruining himself.\r\n\r\n_I’ vaut mûx pillaïr (plier) qu’ rompre._--It is better to bend than\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\n_Il ne faut pas queruaïr trop près des fossaïs._--One should not plough\r\ntoo close to the hedges. Said of people who have no tact and say the\r\nwrong things at the wrong times--“Dancing on the edge of precipices.”\r\n\r\n_Maujeu au naïx, signe d’être guervaï, ou baîsi d’un fou._--Tickling in\r\nthe nose shows that you will either be worried or kissed by a fool!\r\n\r\n_Daeux petites paûretaïs en font une grande._--Two small paupers make\r\none big one; said when two impecunious people marry each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEATHER PROVERBS, ETC.\r\n\r\n    _Quànd tu veis la fieille (feuille) à l’orme_\r\n    _Prends ta pouque et sème ton orge._\r\n\r\n    When you see the leaf on the elm\r\n    Take thy bag and sow thy barley.\r\n\r\n    _Quand il fait biau, prend ton manteau,_\r\n    _Quand il pleut fais coume tu veus._\r\n\r\n    When it is fine take your cloak,\r\n    When it rains do as you like.\r\n\r\n    _Vent perdu, se trouve au sud._\r\n\r\n    A lost wind is found in the south.\r\n\r\n(This is a Sark proverb, and was found by the Rev. G. E. Lee in the\r\nRev. Elie Brevint’s MSS).\r\n\r\n    _Hardi des hâgues sus l’s épines_\r\n    _D’un rude hiver ch’est le signe._\r\n\r\n    Many hips and haws on the trees,\r\n    Is the sign of a severe winter.\r\n\r\n    _Le dix de Mai des sardes au Gaufricher._\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of May, sardans (a kind of fish) are to be found at Le\r\nGaufricher--a rock north of Fermain.\r\n\r\n    _La maïr qui roule au Tas de Peis_\r\n    _Ch’est coumme nous verrait de l’iaue quée._\r\n\r\nThe sea that rolls at the Tas de Pois (the rocks at the end of St.\r\nMartin’s Point) look to the beholder like falling rain.\r\n\r\n    _“La lune levante_\r\n    _La maïr battante.”_\r\n\r\n    At moon rise\r\n    It is high tide.\r\n\r\n    _“Fin nord et epais sud_\r\n    _Ne s’entrefont jamais d’abus_\r\n    _Fin sud et epais nord,_\r\n    _Ne sont jamais d’accord.”_\r\n\r\nA fine north and a lowering south, have no occasion to quarrel, but\r\na fine south and lowering north, will never agree.--_The two last\r\n“dictons” are from John de Garis, Esq._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart III.\r\n\r\nEditor’s Appendix.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Countrymen, whate’er is left to us\r\n    Of ancient heritage--\r\n    Of manners, speech, of humours, polity,\r\n    The limited horizon of our stage--\r\n    Of love, hope, fear,\r\n    All this I fain would fix upon the page:\r\n    That so the coming age,\r\n    Lost in the Empire’s mass,\r\n    Yet haply longing for their fathers, here\r\n    May see, as in a glass,\r\n    What they held dear--\r\n    May say, “’Twas thus and thus\r\n    They lived;” and as the time-flood onward rolls,\r\n    Secure an anchor for their Celtic souls.”\r\n\r\n    (Preface to _The Doctor and other Poems_, by the Rev. T. E. Brown).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nGuernsey Songs and Ballads.\r\n\r\n    “Will no one tell me what she sings?\r\n    Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow\r\n    For old, unhappy, far-off things,\r\n    And battles long ago.”\r\n\r\n                          --_Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n    “Fère les lais, por remembrance.”\r\n\r\n                 --_Marie of France._\r\n\r\n\r\nI have added this chapter to Sir Edgar MacCulloch’s book, as I thought\r\nit a good opportunity of preserving a few of the old ballads and songs\r\nwhich, for generations, amused and interested our forefathers, and\r\nwhich now, alas, are all too surely going or gone from among us,--swept\r\naway by the irrepressible tide of vulgarity and so-called “Progress,”\r\nby which everything of ours that was beautiful, picturesque, or\r\nindividual, has been destroyed. As descendants of the Celtic trouvères,\r\nmenestriers, and jongleurs, as well as of the Norse Skalds, the bards\r\nfrom whose early songs and chants, the literature of Europe has sprung,\r\nwe, Normans, should specially treasure the old poems which have been\r\nhanded down for so many successive generations, and which, in the rapid\r\nextinction of the old language in which Wace, Taillefer, Walter Map,\r\nand Chrestien de Troyes sang, are doomed to oblivion.\r\n\r\nIn most places the old ballads can be divided into two classes--the\r\nReligious and the Secular. The first of these classes, except in the\r\nform of the metrical version of the Psalms by Ronsard, does not seem to\r\nhave existed over here. I can find no trace of any Noëls, or of any\r\nEaster songs. The Secular songs may be divided into the Historical and\r\nthe Social.\r\n\r\nThe Historical deserve precedence. The _Ballade des Aragousais_ of\r\nwhich a translation has already been given, and of which I append the\r\noriginal, is by far the oldest and most interesting. Then comes a\r\nballad descriptive of the Destruction of the Spanish Armada in 1588,\r\nwhich I found in a manuscript book compiled by a Job Mauger in 1722.\r\nIn it he has copied the _Dedicace des Eglises_, and such poems which\r\napparently were current in his day, and which he deemed worthy of\r\npreservation. Of his collection this is the most distinctive, and I\r\nhave included it in this chapter, although it is evidently defective\r\nin parts, as these old ballads, handed down orally from generation to\r\ngeneration, are so apt to be. The _Complaint of the dispossessed Roman\r\nCatholic Clergy_, written in March, 1552, and copied into the Registers\r\nof St. Saviour’s parish in 1696 by Henry Blondel, is already in print,\r\nbeing included in Gustave Dupont’s _Histoire du Cotentin et de ses\r\nIles_, Tome III., p. 311-313.\r\n\r\nJob Mauger’s MSS. also comprise a long and monotonous ballad of twenty\r\nverses describing the destruction by lightning of the Tower of Castle\r\nCornet in 1688, and various poems, conspicuous more by the loyalty\r\nof their sentiments than by the merits of their versification, on\r\ncontemporary events in England, such as--“La mort du Roy Guillaume\r\nIII.,” written in 1702; “Cantique Spirituel à la mémoire de la Royne\r\nMarie IIme., et sur l’oiseau qu’on voit sur son Mausolée;” “Sur la\r\nmort de son Altesse Royale Guillaume, Duc de Glocestre, decedé au\r\nChâteau de Windsor le 30me Juillet, 1700;” and “Vive le Roy George,”\r\nwritten in 1721. He also copies a “Chanson Nouvelle de l’Esclavage de\r\nBarbarie,” doggerel verses “composée par dix pauvres hommes, esclaves\r\nen Barbarie, où ils sont,” viz.: “Edouard Falla, Edouard Mauger,\r\nPhelipe le Marquand, Richard Viel, et ses camarades, Pierre le Gros et\r\nJean Aspuine,” written in the reign of William III.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1736 the bells of the church of S. Peter Port, being no\r\nlonger fit for service, were taken down for the purpose of being melted\r\nand re-cast. This circumstance gave rise to a piece of poetry composed\r\nby the Rev. Elie Dufresne, Rector of the Town parish, of which many\r\nmanuscript copies are in existence.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most popular and widely known of all our local ballads\r\nis “Les vers de Catherine Deslandes,” by an unknown author, descriptive\r\nof the trial and execution for infanticide, of an unhappy woman called\r\nCatherine Deslandes in 1748. These verses have been repeatedly copied\r\nand printed, and are to be found in almost every old farm-house.\r\n\r\nThe Secular ballads were undoubtedly all, or nearly all, importations\r\nfrom the mainland. Of these I have made a selection, and have striven\r\nto record those which do not appear to have been already printed,\r\nor which, like “La Claire Fontaine,” vary considerably from the\r\ncontinental models. Thus “Malbrouck,” which is one of the most widely\r\nknown of all our old ballads, appears in every French “Recueil de\r\nChansons,” and the verses of “Le Juif Errant” and “Geneviève de\r\nBrabant” of which copies are also found in all our old farm houses,\r\nhave also been repeatedly printed on the Continent, so are not included\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nYVON DE GALLES.\r\n\r\n“Surprise de l’Ile de Guernesey l’an 1370, sous le Règne d’Edouard\r\nIII., Roy d’Angleterre, et de Charles V., Roy de France.”\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThis poem is copied from a version compiled by Mr. Métivier, and said\r\nby him to be the revised text of seven mutilated manuscript copies. I\r\nhave also included most of his notes.\r\n\r\n    “Or, grands et petits entendez\r\n    Lai[263] d’allure,[264] fort’ment rimée,[265]\r\n    Sur nombre de gent ramassée,\r\n    Qui va sillant[266] la mer salée,\r\n    Du Roy de France la mesgnée,[267]\r\n    Par Yvon de Galles guidée,\r\n    Si mauvaisement mis à mort.[268]\r\n\r\n    Par un Mardy s’est comparée\r\n    La gendarmerie et l’armée,\r\n    Faite de grands Aragousais[269]\r\n    Gens enragés à l’abordée.\r\n    Dans le Vazon fut addressée\r\n    Cette pilleuse[270] marinée\r\n    Pensant nous mettre tous à mort.\r\n\r\n    Un Jean L’Estocq si se leva,\r\n    Plus matin qu’à l’accoûtumée;\r\n    Et à sa bergerie alla,\r\n    Sur l’ajournant[271] à la brunée.\r\n    Telle compagnie a trouvée\r\n    Sur le grand Marais arrêtée,\r\n    Ce qui grandement l’étonna.\r\n\r\n    Vit un cheval sur son chemin,\r\n    Faisant marche de haquenée,[272]\r\n    Qui, pour vray, étoit un guildin,[273]\r\n    Qui lors échappoit de l’armée.\r\n    Toute l’isle en a chevauchée,\r\n    Criant à la désespérée,\r\n    Sus! aux armes, en un moment!”\r\n\r\n    “Et vous trouvez sur les Vazons![274]\r\n    L’armée est dessus arrêtée;\r\n    Diligentez-vous, bons garçons,\r\n    Ou toute la terre est gâtée!\r\n    Mettez tout au fil de l’épée,\r\n    Hasardez-vous, à bonne heurée,\r\n    Ou vous mourrez griève mort!”\r\n\r\n    Yvon de Galles, vrai guerrier,\r\n    Était conducteur de la guerre,\r\n    Homme grand’ment adventurier,\r\n    Dessus une terre étrangière,\r\n    Ne se donnant garde en arrière,\r\n    Il reçut la rouge jarr’tière\r\n    Qui n’étoit ni soye, ni velours.\r\n\r\n    C’est qu’il fut frappé d’un garçon\r\n    D’une alebarde[275] meurtrière,\r\n    Il se nommoit Richard Simon\r\n    Sur le moulin, en la Carrière,\r\n    Tant qu’il eut la cuisse hachée\r\n    Aussi la main dextre tranchée\r\n    Par ce glorieux compagnon.\r\n\r\n    Sur le mont de St. Pierre Port\r\n    Fut la dure guerre livrée;\r\n    Cinq cents et un fur’ mis à mort,\r\n    Tant de l’isle[276] que de l’armée,[277]\r\n    C’étoit pitié, cette journée\r\n    D’ouïr les pleurs de l’assemblée\r\n    Des dames de St. Pierre Port.\r\n\r\n    Thoumin le Lorreur,[278] tout le jor\r\n    Fut, de vrai, notre capitaine;\r\n    Rouf Hollande[279] fut le plus fort,\r\n    Il eut l’honneur de la quintaine,[280]\r\n    Sa vie, hélas! fut hasardée,\r\n    Car, sa jambe étant fracassée,\r\n    Force lui fut de souffrir mort.\r\n\r\n    Frappant à travers et à tors,\r\n    Le sang courait dans les vallées,\r\n    On marchait dessus les corps morts\r\n    Qui chéaient[281] au fil des épées.\r\n    Une meurtrière[282] fut lancée,\r\n    Qui, à grand’ force débandée,\r\n    Aux Aragousais fit grand tort.\r\n\r\n    Quatre-vingt bons marchands anglais\r\n    Arrivèrent sur l’avesprée;[283]\r\n    A notre secours accouraient,\r\n    Mais l’armée étant fort lassée,\r\n    Leva le siège, tout de voir,[284]\r\n    Ne sachant quel remède avoir,\r\n    Sinon crier à Dieu mercy.\r\n\r\n    Furent contraints de s’enfuir\r\n    Prenant leur chemin gaburon,[285]\r\n    Par les Bordages sont allés,\r\n    Pour passer dedans ils se rue’;\r\n    Mais les Anglais sans retenue,\r\n    Remplissent de corps morts la rue,\r\n    Sur cette troupe de bedots.[286]\r\n\r\n    Par force espreindrent les châtiaus,[287]\r\n    La mer étant fort retirée,\r\n    On les tuait à grands monceaux,\r\n    Taillant tout au fil de l’épée;\r\n    La mer étoit ensanglantée\r\n    De cette troupe ainsi navrée,\r\n    De lez la chair et les corps morts.\r\n\r\n    Ces navires et ces bateaux\r\n    Ceignirent l’isle par derrière;\r\n    Bons paysans leur firent grands tosts,[288]\r\n    Vers le château de la Corbière,[289]\r\n    Vindrent par le Bec-à-la-Chièvre,[290]\r\n    Pour à l’armée faire estère,[291]\r\n    Avec le reste des lourdauds.\r\n\r\n    Rembarquèrent leurs matelots,[292]\r\n    Puis soudain mirent à la vèle,\r\n    Tous marris comme lionceaux\r\n    D’avoir perdu telle bredelle.[293]\r\n    Le général[294] fort ce repelle,[295]\r\n    Commandant de remettre à terre\r\n    Dans le havre de St. Samson.\r\n\r\n    À l’Abbé St. Michel s’en vont,\r\n    Dont Brecard étoit commissaire;\r\n    Il les reçut, à grand cœur-jouaie\r\n    Donnant présents et fort grand chère\r\n    Donnant or à la gente amée,[296]\r\n    Qui était dame dans l’armée\r\n    Nommée Princesse Alinor.\r\n\r\n    Car Yvon l’avoit épousée\r\n    En France au pays de Gravelle,\r\n    Dont il fut riche à grands monceis[297]\r\n    Des biens de la grand’ mariée.\r\n    L’abbé fit grand joie à l’armée\r\n    D’or et d’argent et de monnoye\r\n    Qu’il leur donna bien largement.\r\n\r\n    Yvon, l’ennemy, s’en alla\r\n    Sur une montagne voisine\r\n    Du pauvre Château St. Michel,\r\n    Là où Yvon faisait ses mines.[298]\r\n    Frère Brecart,[299] par courtoisie\r\n    S’adresse au château par envie\r\n    De faire crôitre ses trésors.\r\n\r\n    Mais Aymon[300] Rose, retranché\r\n    Au puissant Chasteau de l’Archange\r\n    Dit qu’il serait avant tranché.\r\n    Que de se rendre à gent estrange;\r\n    Mais si ses gens se veulent rendre\r\n    A Brecart, pour leur terre vendre,\r\n    Par compos,[301] il estoit d’accord.\r\n\r\n    Le pauvre peuple se rendit\r\n    A cet Abbé pour leur grand perte\r\n    Qu’il avoit pour eux accordé\r\n    Aux ennemis par ses finesses\r\n    Dont assoujettirent leurs terres\r\n    La plupart à payer deux gerbes\r\n    Nommez aujourd’hui les champarts.[302]\r\n\r\n    Quand Yvon fut bien soudoyé\r\n    S’est rembarqué dans ses navires\r\n    Dans le Coquet s’en est allé\r\n    Se refournir de nouveaux vivres,\r\n    En passant par devant Belle Isle\r\n    Mit le feu dans trente navires\r\n    N’ayant que les garçons à bord.\r\n\r\n    Le vent du sud étant venu\r\n    Sillant la côte de Bretagne\r\n    Un navire Anglois est venu\r\n    Dont ils eurrent bien de la hoigne[303]\r\n    Saillit soixante hommes ensemble\r\n    À bord Yvon, sans plus attendre\r\n    Qui les lièrent tous à bord.\r\n\r\n    Puis violèrent Alinor,\r\n    En la présence de son homme\r\n    Lui étant lié au grand mât\r\n    Les amenèrent à Hantonne[304]\r\n    Yvon étant un mauvais homme\r\n    Eut sur sa tête une couronne\r\n    Savoir ung mourion tout chaud.\r\n\r\n    Puis pendirent toutes ces gens\r\n    Portez à chartez[305] couple à couple\r\n    Et Alinor eut un présent\r\n    Pour gueuser une belle poche\r\n    Et avec peines et travaux\r\n    Cherchant son pain de porte en porte\r\n    Après plaisir eurent grands maux.\r\n\r\n    Les dix-neuf autres vaisseaux\r\n    Voulez-vous ouïyr leur destinée\r\n    Ils se dissout de grands châteaux\r\n    De tourments bien agittée\r\n    Or voilà donc leur destinée\r\n    C’est qu’ils burent la mer salée\r\n    Brisant dessus les Hanouets.\r\n\r\n    Au matin coume des porceaux\r\n    Estoient au plein cette journée\r\n    Où ils avaient fait leurs grands maux\r\n    En Guernesey la bienheureuse\r\n    Ils estoient là en grands monceaux\r\n    Dessus les sablons de Rocquaine\r\n    Après plaisir eurent grands maux.\r\n\r\nFIN.\r\n\r\n[263] _Lai_--Chant, mélodie, complainte.\r\n\r\n[264] _Allure_--pas continu, mesuré.\r\n\r\n[265] _Fort’ment rimée_--dont la rime est riche, roulante.\r\n\r\n[266] _Sillant_ v. fr.: fendant, coupant.\r\n\r\n[267] _Mesgnée_--guern’ _mégnie_,--maisonnée, troupe.\r\n\r\n[268] _Mis à mort_--assassiné par le traître gallois John Lambe,\r\nsoudoyé par Richard II.\r\n\r\n[269] _Aragousais_--Chez les Gascons, nos compatriotes alors,\r\n_Aragous_, espagnol. L’Aragon était le royaume principal.\r\n\r\n[270] _Pilleuse_--pirates.\r\n\r\n[271] _Ajournant_--v. fr. ajornant, faire _jor_ ou jour.\r\n\r\n[272] _Haquenée_--cheval qui va l’amble, hobin.\r\n\r\n[273] _Guildin_--Anglais _gelding_.\r\n\r\n[274] Les Vazons--Marais, tourbières, aujourd’hui Vazon. Il y avait le\r\nVazon d’Albecq et le Vazon du Marais.\r\n\r\n[275] _Alebarde_--sans aspiration, comme l’Ital: _alabarda_.\r\n\r\n[276] _L’isle_--les habitants de l’île.\r\n\r\n[277] _L’armée_--la flotte étrangère.\r\n\r\n[278] _Le Lorreur_--surnom d’une famille câtelaine dont les traces se\r\nretrouvent au commencement du dix-septième siècle. _Le lourreur_ était\r\nun joueur de cornemuse, Normand _lourre_, Danois _luur_. C’est tout un\r\nalors pour nous autres Anglais, que _Thoumin le Lorreur_, et “Tommy the\r\nPiper.”\r\n\r\nThe first mention of a “Le Lorreur” in the Channel Islands I have\r\nfound, occurs in the Calendar of Patent Rolls for 1316, where Philip\r\nL’Evesque, Bailiff of Jersey, witnesses (June 25th, 1311) a demise by\r\nMacie Le Lorreur, clerk, to Richard le Fessu, his brother, Viscount\r\nof Jersie, of the escheat of Pierres du Mouster, for twelve cabots\r\nof wheat rent yearly, for three virgates of land in the parish of\r\nGrouville. The Richard le Fessu mentioned above was also known as\r\nRichard _de Jersey_, he married Elizabeth de Burgo, described as the\r\nKing’s kinswoman, and in 1317 the King gave, as a grant for life, to\r\n“John de Jereseye” his son, the Viscounty of Jersey, which his father\r\nhad held during his life-time.\r\n\r\n[279] _Rouf Hollande_--On August 26th 1338, a warrant was issued\r\nagainst a _Richard de Holand_, who had absconded with £40 delivered to\r\nJohn Godefelawe of Southampton, by John de Harleston, for payment of\r\nthe wages of the garrison of Jersey. (Calendar of Patent Rolls).\r\n\r\n[280] _Quintaine_--espèce de tournoi.\r\n\r\n[281] _Chéaient_--tombaient guern: et norm: queyaient.\r\n\r\n[282] _Meurtrière_--Catapulte, machine qui lançait des pierres et des\r\ndards.\r\n\r\n[283] _Avesprées_--Commencement du soir.\r\n\r\n[284] _Voir_--Vrai.\r\n\r\n[285] _Gaburon_--Ce serait pêle-mêle, a la manière de goujats, des\r\nmanants. Telle serait, osons le croire, l’origine du guernesiais\r\n“_pêle-mêle gabouaret_.”\r\n\r\n[286] _Bedots_--étrangers, trompeurs. L’acceptation française de\r\n_bedos_, selon Roquefort, était autrefois “forain.”\r\n\r\n[287] _Espreindrent_--serrèrent, assaillirent. Selon les annales du\r\ntemps, le château ne fut pas pris.\r\n\r\n[288] _Tosts_, pour _tostes_, soufflets, “good thrashings.”\r\n\r\n[289] _La Corbière_--The point underneath “Village de Putron,” just\r\nnorth of Fermain Point, is called “La Corbière,” but this line probably\r\nrefers to the Vale Castle, in the parish of St. Michel de l’Archange du\r\nValle.\r\n\r\n[290] _Bec-à-la chièvre_--Just underneath Fort George, the southern\r\nboundary of Petit Fort Bay.\r\n\r\n[291] _Estère_--passage.\r\n\r\n[292] _Matelots_--camarades, guern: _matnots_, mot franc-tudesque. Ici\r\nce n’est pas un marinier exclusivement, c’est un _mess-mate_.\r\n\r\n[293] _Bredelle_--morceau.\r\n\r\n[294] _Général_--l’Amiral, celui qui commande la générale, angl:\r\n_flag-ship_.\r\n\r\n[295] _Repelle_--rejette, oppose.\r\n\r\n[296] _Gente amée_--gentille amie.\r\n\r\n[297] _Monceis_--monceaux.\r\n\r\n[298] _Mines_--Semblant de vouloir assaillir le Château (de Néel de St.\r\nSauveur, aujourd’hui Château des Marais ou Ivy Castle).\r\n\r\n[299] _Brecart_--The Brecarts, Bregearts, or Briards, were a\r\ncomparatively influential family in the parishes of the Vale and St.\r\nSampson’s up to the sixteenth century; they then bought land in the\r\ntown, in the district of Vauvert, and became known as “Brégart alias\r\nVauvert,” and finally as “Vauvert,” _pur et simple_, they seem to have\r\nbecome extinct in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[300] _Aymon Rose_--“Edmund de Ros ou Rous” était d’origine Normande.\r\n\r\n“It appears that Edmund Rose, who defended Castle Cornet on this\r\noccasion was only Lieut.-Governor, as, in the previous year, Walter\r\nHuwet appears as governor of all the islands. There is a letter from\r\nthe King to Edmund Rose, dated the 14th of August, 1372, as Constable\r\nof the Castle of Gorey in Jersey; so that within two months after Yvon\r\nhad raised this siege of Castle Cornet, he, Edmund Rose, must have\r\nbeen sent to that of Gorey.”--(_Some Remarks on the Constitution of\r\nGuernsey_, by T. F. de H., p. 119.)\r\n\r\n_Champarts_--The “Camparts”--or the eleventh part of the grain grown\r\nupon the land of the fief, is described by Warburton thus:--“The first\r\ndukes of Normandy granted several parcels of land in the island, to\r\nsuch as had served them in their wars, and granted likewise a very\r\nconsiderable part to some religious houses. These, whether soldiers or\r\nchurchmen, not being themselves skilled in agriculture, let out these\r\nlands to tenants under them, reserving such rents and services as they\r\nthought most convenient; such was the “Campart,” and such were the\r\n“chef-rentes,” and these have been in use ever since Richard I., duke\r\nof Normandy, and possibly they may yet be of more ancient date.… In the\r\nClos du Valle, out of extraordinary respect for the Abbot who resided\r\namong them, they paid both the _tenth_ and the _eleventh_ sheaf, both\r\nas _tithe_ and _campart_.” Camparts were owed on many fiefs, if not on\r\nall. Many owners of land have redeemed them. Others have _affranchis_\r\ntheir land, which is done by Act of Court, on proof that the land has\r\nbeen under grass for forty years, and lasts as long as the land is\r\ntilled yearly.\r\n\r\n[301] _Compos_--Composition.\r\n\r\n[302] Here Mr. Métivier’s version ends, the remainder is from an old\r\nGuernsey Almanac dated 1828.\r\n\r\n[303] _Hoigne_--Haine.\r\n\r\n[304] _Hantonne_--Southampton.\r\n\r\n[305] _A chartez_--En charrettes.\r\n\r\n\r\nL’ARMÉE D’ESPAGNE, DEFAITTE EN L’AN 1588.\r\n\r\n    Puissant Roy d’Espagne,\r\n    Combien riche tu es\r\n    Pour

C’est un bâtiment qui n’a ni pont, ni tillac,\r\nni couverture.\r\n\r\n[315] _Dras_--Drake. Motley, in his _History of the Netherlands_,\r\nVol. II., pp. 498-9, says: There were many quarrels among the English\r\nadmirals at this period, and much jealousy of Drake.\r\n\r\n[316] _Duc de Mydine_--The Duke of Medina-Sidonia, leader of the\r\nSpanish Armada, who, when the great hulk Satana and a galleon of\r\nPortugal were attacked by the _Triumph_ and some other vessels, on the\r\nflag-ship, (the _St. Martin_) tried to repel Lord Howard on the _Ark\r\nRoyal_ and other men-of-war, and thence arose the hottest conflict of\r\nthe day. He had previously, when Don Pedro de Valdez, commander of the\r\nAndelusian squadron,--having got his foremast carried away close to the\r\ndeck,--lay crippled and helpless, calmly fired a gun to collect his\r\nscattered ships, and abandoned Valdez to his fate.… The next day Valdez\r\nsurrendered to the _Revenge_.--Motley’s _Netherlands_, Vol. II., pp.\r\n456-7.\r\n\r\n[317] _Bahut_--Coffre couvert de cuir orné de petits clous.\r\n\r\n[318] _Cas_--Terme de Pratique, Matière, Crime.\r\n\r\n[319] _Le Grand Dauphin, etc._--Don Diego de Pimental, nephew of the\r\nViceroy of Sicily, and uncle to the Viceroy of Naples, was captured in\r\nhis ship the _St. Matthew_, by Admiral Van der Does, of the Holland\r\nfleet.--_Motley_, Vol. II., p. 473.\r\n\r\n[320] _Nef_--Navire.\r\n\r\n[321] Alexander, Prince Farnèse, and Duke of Parma, was commandant\r\nof the Spanish Army, and was waiting in Flanders for an opportunity\r\nof co-operating with the Spanish fleet. He was suspected of having a\r\nsecret treaty with Queen Elizabeth, (_Motley_, Vol. II., p. 273-4),\r\nbut these verses are so very obscure, it is impossible to identify the\r\nincidents to which they allude. It may be that they, as well as the\r\nlast verse of this poem are interpolations from some other ballad,\r\nwhich has got confused with this one.\r\n\r\n[322] _Mi-été_--le milieu de l’été.\r\n\r\n[323] _Harnois_.--signifie l’habillement d’un homme d’armes.\r\n\r\n[324] _Fil de l’epée_--est en usage depuis long temps. Ronsard a dit\r\nparlant de Henri III., … “devant le _fil_ de son epée.”\r\n\r\n[325] _Fronder_--Attaquer quelque chose.\r\n\r\n[326] _Flibot_--Terme de marine. C’est un moïen vaisseau qui est armé\r\nen course.\r\n\r\n[327] _Sarcler_--Terme de Laboureur. Couper les méchantes herbes avec\r\nle sarcloir.\r\n\r\n[328] _Moufles_--Garnie de poulies de cuivre, de boulons, et de\r\ncordages pour monter les pièces d’artillerie à l’elesoir.\r\n\r\n[329] That this poem is very defective, and therefore obscure,\r\nis obvious, but I thought even this mutilated fragment was worth\r\npreserving. Many of the statements made in it are not borne out by\r\nhistory, though they probably formed part of the gossip of that day,\r\nand had filtered over to the Islands from sailors who had themselves\r\nhad a share in some of the events narrated. This last verse seems to\r\nhave no connection with the rest of the poem, but I have copied it as\r\nJob Mauger wrote it, nearly two centuries ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecular Poems.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLE ROSE AU ROSIER BLANC.\r\n\r\n    J’ai cueilli la belle rose\r\n    Qui pendait au rosier blanc,\r\n            Belle Rose\r\n    Belle Rose au rosier blanc!\r\n\r\n    Je la cueillis feuille à feuille\r\n    Et la mis dans mon tablier blanc\r\n            Belle Rose\r\n    Belle Rose au rosier blanc.\r\n\r\n    Je l’ai portée chez mon père\r\n    Entre Paris et Rouen\r\n            Belle Rose\r\n    Belle Rose au rosier blanc.\r\n\r\n    Las!--je n’ai trouvé personne\r\n    Que le rossignol chantant\r\n            Belle Rose\r\n    Belle Rose au rosier blanc.\r\n\r\n    Qui me dit dans son langage\r\n    Mariez vous à quinze ans\r\n            Belle Rose\r\n    Belle Rose au rosier blanc!\r\n\r\n    Hélas comment me marîrai-je?\r\n    Moi qui suis baisse[330] pour un an,\r\n            Belle Rose,\r\n    Belle Rose au rosier blanc!\r\n\r\n    Combien gagnez vous, la belle?\r\n    Combien gagnez vous par an?\r\n            Belle Rose\r\n    Belle Rose au rosier blanc!\r\n\r\n    Je gagne bien cent pistoles\r\n    Cent pistoles en argent blanc\r\n            Belle Rose\r\n    Belle Rose au rosier blanc.\r\n\r\n    Venez avec moi, ma belle,\r\n    Vous en aurez bien autant\r\n            Belle Rose\r\n    Belle Rose au rosier blanc.\r\n\r\n    Je ne vais avec personne\r\n    Si l’on ne m’épouse avant\r\n            Belle Rose\r\n    Belle Rose au rosier blanc.\r\n\r\n    Si l’on ne me mène à l’église\r\n    Par devant tous mes parents\r\n            Belle Rose\r\n    Belle Rose au rosier blanc![331]\r\n\r\n[330] Baisse--servant girl.\r\n\r\n[331] There are many versions of this song to be found among the\r\ncountry people, I have compared this with five or six others, and it\r\nis, I think, the most generally received.\r\n\r\n\r\nÀ LA CLAIRE FONTAINE.\r\n\r\n    À la claire fontaine\r\n    Dondaine, ma dondaine\r\n    Les mains me suis lavé\r\n    Dondaine ma lou-lou-la\r\n    Les mains me suis lavé,\r\n    Dondaine m’a dondé.\r\n\r\n    A la feuille d’un chêne\r\n    Dondaine, ma dondaine\r\n    Je les ai essuyées\r\n    Dondaine ma lou-lou-la\r\n    Je les ai essuyées\r\n    Dondaine m’a dondé.\r\n\r\n    À la plus haute branche\r\n    Dondaine, ma dondaine\r\n    Un rossignol chantait\r\n    Dondaine ma lou-lou-la\r\n    Un rossignol chantait\r\n    Dondaine m’a dondé.\r\n\r\n    Chante, rossignol, chante\r\n    Dondaine, ma dondaine,\r\n    Toi qui as le cœur gai\r\n    Dondaine ma lou-lou-la\r\n    Toi qui as le cœur gai\r\n    Dondaine m’a dondé.\r\n\r\n    Le mien n’est pas de mème\r\n    Dondaine, ma dondaine,\r\n    Il est bien affligé\r\n    Dondaine ma lou-lou-la\r\n    Il est bien affligé\r\n    Dondaine m’a dondé.\r\n\r\n    Pierre, mon ami Pierre,\r\n    Dondaine, ma dondaine,\r\n    À la guerre est allé\r\n    Dondaine ma lou-lou-la\r\n    A la guerre est allé\r\n    Dondaine m’a dondé.\r\n\r\n    Pour un bouton de rose\r\n    Dondaine, ma dondaine\r\n    Que je lui refusai\r\n    Dondaine ma lou-lou-la\r\n    Que je lui refusai\r\n    Dondaine m’a dondé.\r\n\r\n    Je voudrais que la rose\r\n    Dondaine, ma dondaine\r\n    Fut encore au rosier\r\n    Dondaine ma lou-lou-la\r\n    Fut encore au rosier\r\n    Dondaine m’a dondé.\r\n\r\n    Et que mon ami Pierre\r\n    Dondaine, ma dondaine\r\n    Fut ici à m’aimer\r\n    Dondaine ma lou-lou-la\r\n    Fut ici à m’aimer\r\n    Dondaine m’a, dondé.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUI VEUT OUÏR.\r\n\r\n    Qui veut ouïr, qui veut savoir } bis.\r\n    Comment les maris aiment?      }\r\n    Ils aiment si brutalement\r\n    Ils sont de si brutales gens,\r\n    Qu’on les entend toujours disant\r\n    (Parlé) “Ah Madame allez gardez\r\n    Le ménage et les enfants!”\r\n            Fal-la-la.\r\n\r\n    Qui veut ouïr, qui veut savoir } bis.\r\n    Comment les filles aiment?     }\r\n    Elles aiment si discrètement\r\n    Elles sont de si discrètes gens,\r\n    Qu’on les entend toujours disant\r\n    (Parlé) “Ah Monsieur ne parlez pas si haut\r\n    Car Maman nous entendra.”\r\n            Fal-la-la.\r\n\r\n    Qui veut ouïr, qui veut savoir } bis.\r\n    Comment les veuves aiment?     }\r\n    Elles aiment si sensiblement\r\n    Elles sont de si sensibles gens,\r\n    Qu’on les entend toujours disant\r\n    (Parlé) “Ah! le beau jeune homme!\r\n    Comme il ressemble à feu mon mari.”\r\n            Fal-la-la.\r\n\r\n    Qui veut ouïr, qui veut savoir } bis.\r\n    Comment les soldats aiment?    }\r\n    Ils aiment si cavalièrement\r\n    Ils sont de si cavaliers gens\r\n    Qu’on les entend toujours disant\r\n    (Parlé) “Ah!

(See p.p. 59-77), so, as Sir Edgar MacCulloch had not\r\n    mentioned it in his MSS. I have ventured to include a short\r\n    description of it in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe “Clameur de Haro,” abolished in Normandy, A.D., 1583, is, perhaps,\r\nthe most ancient and curious legal survival in the Channel Islands.\r\n\r\nShould a Channel Islander consider his estate to be injured, or his\r\nrights to be infringed, by the action of another, in the presence of\r\ntwo witnesses he kneels on the ground and says:--\r\n\r\n“Haro! Haro! Haro! à l’aide mon Prince! on me fait tort!” and he then\r\nrepeats the Lord’s Prayer in French.\r\n\r\nThis formula, which is tantamount to an injunction to stay proceedings,\r\ncauses all obnoxious practices to be suspended until the case has\r\nbeen tried in Court, when the party who is found to be in the wrong\r\nis condemned to a fine and a “Regard de Château,” which, in former\r\ntimes, meant a night’s imprisonment. All “Clameurs,” according to an\r\nordonnance of October 1st, 1599, have to be registered at the Greffe\r\nwithin twenty-four hours, on penalty of being “convict en sa clameur,”\r\nand, should no proceedings be taken within a year of the clameur, it is\r\nconsidered to have lapsed.\r\n\r\nAn order of Queen Elizabeth relative to Guernsey, given at Richmond,\r\nOctober 9th, 1580, decides that “yt shall not be lawfull to appeale in\r\nanie cause criminell, or of correction, nor from the execution of anie\r\norder taken in their Courte of Chief Pleas, nor in cries of Haro.”[338]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important occasions on which this prerogative was used\r\nhappened in the year 1850, when it was in contemplation to demolish\r\nthe ancient fortifications of Castle Cornet, but the late Mr. Martin\r\nF. Tupper, who was then on a visit to Guernsey, had recourse to this\r\nform of appeal, and saved the oldest parts of the fortress from\r\ndemolition. An extraordinary instance of a “Clameur” took place in\r\nthe Church of Sark on the 14th of December, 1755. A great dispute had\r\narisen between Dame Elizabeth Etienne, widow of Mr. Daniel Le Pelley,\r\nSeigneur of Sark, and the ecclesiastical authorities of Guernsey, as\r\nto in whose gift was the living of the Church of Sark. She appointed\r\na Mr. Jean Févot to the Church, and when Mr. Pierre Levrier, who had\r\nbeen appointed by the Dean of Guernsey to this post, arrived in Sark\r\nto perform the service, he found Mr. Févot in the pulpit. He then and\r\nthere, in the words of various scandalized eye-witnesses, “interjetta\r\nune Clameur de Haro, environ les deux heures d’après-midi, dans le tems\r\nqu’il avoit commencé à lire le service Divin.”[339] This of course led\r\nto many disputes, and for over a year Dame Le Pelley locked up the\r\nChurch of Sark, and allowed no one to enter it. Finally, after much\r\nlitigation, and threats of major excommunication from the Guernsey\r\nEcclesiastical Court, the Bishop of Winchester intervened, Pierre\r\nLevrier was forcibly ejected from the island, and, in 1757, Mr. Cayeux\r\nDeschamps was given the living.\r\n\r\nFour cases of “Clameurs” were registered between the years 1880-90, and\r\nan instance occurred as recently as 1902.\r\n\r\nThere has been much controversy as to the origin of the word “Haro.”\r\nTerrien, (_Coutûme de Normandie_, Edition 1684, p. 104), ascribes it\r\nto Rollo, Duke of Normandy, Ha-Ro, and says “La seule prononciation\r\nde son nom, même après tant de siècles a cette vertu, qu’elle engage\r\nceux contre lesquels on s’en sert à cesser leurs entreprises et atenter\r\nrien au-de-là.” Laurence Carey, in his essay on the Laws and Customs\r\nof the Island, and all the other old writers say likewise, but modern\r\nphilologists, such as Le Héricher and George Métivier have disputed\r\nthis theory, and have resolved the word “Haro” into a “cri de charge,”\r\nwhich has survived as such in the English “Hurrah.” Froissart employs\r\nit frequently as the sound of combat: “Le _Haro_ commença à monter,”\r\nand, in the description of the battle of Bouvines, won from the Germans\r\nand English in 1214, by Guillaume Guiart, who died in 1306 we find:--\r\n\r\n    “La vois de nuls n’i est oïe\r\n    Fors des heraux qui _harou_ crient,\r\n    Et par le champ se crucefient\r\n    _Harou_, dient-ils, quel mortaille!\r\n    Quelle occision! quelle bataille!”[340]\r\n\r\n[338] _Livres des Jugements, etc._, Vol. II., p. 16, (transcribed from\r\nBritish Museum, Lansdowne MSS., No. 155, fol. 426).\r\n\r\n[339] From Colonel Ernest Le Pelley’s MSS.\r\n\r\n[340] See _Dictionnaire Franco-Normand_, by G. Métivier, p. 280.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A. Ghosts.\r\n\r\n    Referred to on page 288.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GHOST OF MR. BLONDEL.\r\n\r\nAt “Les Mourains” we have seen that the ghost was “laid” by the means\r\nof the clergy of the parish, (see page 288) and it is evident by the\r\nfollowing stories that the laying of spirits frequently formed part of\r\nthe duties of the clergy in Guernsey in the last century.\r\n\r\nThe house Colonel Le Pelley now inhabits at St. Peter-in-the-Wood,\r\nwas formerly owned by an old Mr. Blondel, who, on his death bed,\r\ngave instructions to Mr. Thomas Brock (then Rector of the parish and\r\ngrandfather of the present Rector, Mr. H. Walter Brock), to toll the\r\nbig bell to announce his decease.\r\n\r\nThis was not done, but Mr. Blondel’s spirit determined to show that\r\npromises to the dying were not to be trifled with! All the parish of\r\nSt. Pierre-du-Bois were ready to affirm that the ghost was to be seen\r\nclimbing up the Church tower; and in the Rectory kitchen the china on\r\nthe dresser would make a clattering noise and finally be swept by the\r\nunseen hands on to the floor.\r\n\r\nLife at the Rectory became so unendurable under these circumstances\r\nthat Mr. Brock finally decided to “lay” the ghost, and confine it to\r\nits own house. So he went to “Prospect Place,” as the house is now\r\ncalled, with twelve others of the local clergy. They shut every door\r\nand window, and blocked up every crevice, key-hole, etc., through\r\nwhich the spirit might pass. They then prayed in every room, after\r\nwhich having driven the spirit out of each room in succession, they\r\nlocked it up in a cupboard, with either the key of the Church door or\r\na specially-made silver key (Miss Le Pelley could not find out which,\r\nsome say one, and some another), but the ghost has not troubled the\r\nBrock family since.\r\n\r\nThe old servants now living in the house firmly believe that the ghost\r\nstill inhabits the cupboard, and affirm that its groans can still be\r\nheard.[341]\r\n\r\n[341] From Miss E. Le Pelley.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD HOUSE AT ST. GEORGE.\r\n\r\nJudith Ozanne, an old woman, who is servant at the Le Pelleys’, tells\r\nthe following story.\r\n\r\nHer uncle, an old Mr. Ozanne, remembered the last Mr. Guille who\r\ninhabited the original “St. George,” the old house which has been\r\nreplaced by the modern building which is now known as “St. George.”\r\n\r\nThis Mr. Guille left instructions that the old house was never to be\r\npulled down, as a spirit had been shut up in one of the cupboards; but\r\nhis son found the old house quite unsuitable for his bride to live in,\r\nso he pulled it down, and built the present house, and the consequence\r\nwas that the poor homeless spirit was forced to wander about the\r\ngarden. Judith’s uncle saw him often on moonlight nights, wandering\r\namong the trees around the pond.\r\n\r\nAll the family saw him too, and decided that something had to be done.\r\nSo they had a “conjuration” as they call a laying of the spirit, and\r\ntried to induce it to enter an underground cellar, and shut it down by\r\nmeans of a trap door.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Ozanne would never say whether or no they were successful.\r\nJudith Ozanne finishes the story by saying, “And I should like to know\r\nwhat would happen to Mr. Blondel’s spirit if this house were burnt\r\ndown?”[342]\r\n\r\nMany of the old Guernsey “haunted houses” had their ghosts locked up\r\nin cupboards. Mrs. Le Poidevin, who in her youth had been an “ironer,”\r\nand had gone round from house to house ironing after the weekly washing\r\nat home had taken place, related that the famous haunted house at\r\nthe Tour Beauregard was also in possession of a ghost locked up in\r\na cupboard, a cupboard whose doors, in spite of many efforts, would\r\nnot open, and from which the most fearful groans and dismal wailings\r\nwere heard to arise. Mrs. Le Poidevin also used to go as ironer to\r\nthe old house at the top of Smith Street, now pulled down, belonging,\r\nto the de Jersey family. In this house also was a ghost locked up in\r\na cupboard, and Mrs. de Jersey, a very strong minded old lady,--in\r\ndefiance of superstition--insisted on having this cupboard door forced\r\nopen, and the ghost escaped! After that the house was rendered almost\r\nuninhabitable by the frightful noises that were heard all over it. No\r\none could get any sleep, and not a servant could be found to stay in\r\nthe house. So finally Mrs. de Jersey decided to have the clergy called\r\nin, and one of the maids described to Mrs. Le Poidevin the ceremonies\r\nthat ensued.\r\n\r\nShe said that every outer door was locked, all the crevices between the\r\nwindow sashes were wedged up, and every keyhole was plugged up. Then\r\nthe minister of St. James’ and some of the other clergy prayed in every\r\nroom, and she thought they read something about “casting out devils.”\r\nFinally the ghost was locked up with the key of the Church door.[343]\r\n\r\n[342] From Miss E. Le Pelley.\r\n\r\n[343] From Mrs. Le Poidevin.\r\n\r\nIn Moncure Conway’s book on _Demonology and Devil-Lore_, Vol. I., p.\r\n102, he says:--“The key has a holy sense in various religions.” I have\r\nnot been able to find out the exact formula used by the clergy, but in\r\nthe Sarum Office, and also in the first Prayer Book of Edward VI., an\r\nexorcism is given to be used at the Baptism of Infants, in which the\r\nevil spirit is addressed as follows:--“Therefore, thou accursed spirit,\r\nremember thy sentence, remember thy judgment, remember the day to be\r\nat hand, wherein thou shalt burn in fire everlasting, prepared for\r\nthee and thy angels,” etc. This was founded on the ancient exorcisms,\r\nand was only left out in the revision of 1552, in deference to the\r\ncriticisms of Bucer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GHOSTS OF LA PETITE PORTE.\r\n\r\nLa Petite Porte is the sandy bay immediately underneath Jerbourg.\r\nTradition derives its name “the little door” from an incident which\r\nis said to have occurred in 1338. In those days the French had made\r\none of their periodical inroads on the island, and were in possession\r\nof its principal fortresses. Eighty-seven men of St. Martin’s parish,\r\nheaded by l’honorable “Capitaine Jean de la Marche,”[344] attempted\r\nto dislodge them, but were defeated at Mare-Madoc, in the Hubits, and\r\nfled down to La Petite Porte, where they embarked for Jersey, and\r\nfounded a colony at St. Ouen’s. An old Jersey manuscript goes on to\r\nsay that Charles II., during his sojourn in Jersey, was so touched by\r\nthe recital of the bravery and fidelity of these men, that he granted\r\nto the “South” Regiment of Militia, the old “Regiment Bleu,” a special\r\n“aiguillette d’argent.” Later authorities disprove this, on the grounds\r\nthat there were not, at this epoch, either regiments or uniforms, and\r\nthat the “royal blue facings and silver lace” quoted as “being borne at\r\npresent by the South Regiment of Militia” did not exist two centuries\r\nago!\r\n\r\nBut among the old country people, to the present day, the bay known\r\nas “Moulin Huet” is invariably called “Vier Port” (old harbour), and\r\nif one mentions “Moulin Huet _Bay_” they will tell you that the name\r\n“Moulin Huet” only applies to the old mill, (now destroyed, and the\r\nsite turned into a picnic house), and that it was “Les Anglais” who\r\ntransferred the name of the mill to the bay just below, so that “La\r\nPetite Porte,” being just the other side of the bay, might easily have\r\nbeen originally “Petit Port”--(Little Harbour.)\r\n\r\nBounded by the “Tas de Pois,” the most magnificent rocks in the Channel\r\nIslands, it is noted for its beauty, and, from its long expanse of\r\nsand, is the best place for sand-eeling. But about the beginning of\r\nlast century no sand-eelers dared approach this spot by night. Screams,\r\nshrieks, and groans were heard there, night after night, and finally\r\nit was shunned after dark by the whole island. There was no difficulty\r\nin the people’s minds in accounting for these sounds. Two such awful\r\ntragedies were connected with this bay and its environs that it was an\r\n“embarras de richesse” to decide which of the ghosts of the two men who\r\nhad been murdered in this vicinity it could be!\r\n\r\nThe first of these stories has already been published in a little\r\nbook, now out of print, called _Anglo-Norman Legends_ or _Tales of the\r\nChannel Islands_, N.D., under the title of “John Andrew Gordier,” and\r\nhas also been taken as the foundation of “Rachel Mauger, a Guernsey\r\nTragedy,” published some years ago in Clarke’s _Guernsey Magazine_,\r\nwhere also, in the number for May, 1883, the same story is given in a\r\ncondensed form, as taken from a newspaper cutting, and is preceded by\r\nthe following note, signed “J. Y.\r\n\r\n“The following striking narrative, relating to the origin of a drama\r\ncelebrated in its day (the tragedy of “Julia”), became known to the\r\nwriter through an old newspaper cutting preserved in a family scrap\r\nbook. The newspaper of which we speak must be at least fifty years old\r\n(in 1883), and it related events which were then long past.”\r\n\r\nA book called _The Locket_, by Mrs. Alfred Marks is based on the same\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nThough these events must have happened nearly two hundred years ago,\r\nthere are still some recollections of them lingering in the minds of\r\nthe very old people, who preface them by saying “_J’ai ouï dire à ma\r\ngran’mère!_”\r\n\r\nThe story runs thus:--About the end of the seventeenth century there\r\nwas an extremely beautiful girl, living at the Varclin, in St. Martin’s\r\nparish, called Rachel Mauger. The Maugers were of a good old Guernsey\r\nfamily, and were, in those days, extremely well-to-do. She was\r\nengaged to John Andrew Gordier, a native of Jersey, though of French\r\nextraction. One day he sent her word that he was going to sail over\r\nfrom Jersey to see her, and intended landing at La Petite Porte, which\r\nwas the nearest place to her house. She started to go to meet him.\r\nBut he never appeared, and she had to return home, fearing that some\r\naccident had happened to him. What really had happened was this: There\r\nwas a wealthy merchant, in St. Peter Port, named Gaillard, who had\r\nlong wished to marry Rachel; he had formerly been her father’s clerk,\r\nso they had been much thrown together, but she did not reciprocate his\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nThe day Mr. Gordier sailed over to Guernsey, Gaillard was down in the\r\nbay of La Petite Porte, having previously been refused admission to\r\nthe Mauger’s house, on the ground that Mr. Gordier was expected, and\r\nthey were all busy preparing for his reception. Brooding over his\r\nwrongs, he looked up, and saw his rival just on the point of landing.\r\nMad with jealousy he waited behind the rocks till he saw him preparing\r\nto ascend the winding path which leads to the top of the cliff, then he\r\nrushed out, and stabbed him twice in the back with the knife he always\r\ncarried, and, doubling him up, thrust the body into a cave close by\r\nwith a particularly small entrance. The cave is still pointed out, and\r\nis on the western side of the bay, just below the path, leading from La\r\nPetite Porte to Moulin Huet. Before leaving the body, Gaillard searched\r\nit, and abstracted a peculiarly-shaped locket from one of the pockets,\r\nwhich Gordier was bringing as a present to his _fiancée_.\r\n\r\nOf course the disappearance of Gordier led to a search, and his body\r\nbeing finally discovered in this cave by some boys, his murder was\r\nmade manifest. His mother finally resolved to come over and visit\r\nher intended daughter-in-law, whom she found in a most depressed and\r\nexcitable condition, and evidently dying of a broken heart. United to\r\nthe shock of her lover’s death, she had been exposed to the incessant\r\npersecution of her relations, who were determined that she should marry\r\nGaillard, and had insisted that she should accept the locket that he\r\nhad stolen from Gordier’s corpse, and, with a refinement of malice, had\r\npressed on her. So unstrung was the unfortunate Rachel that she did\r\nnothing but sink into one fainting fit after another on seeing Mrs.\r\nGordier, and when the latter, struck with horror on seeing this jewel\r\non her watch-chain, asked her how she had come into possession of a\r\nlocket which had, she knew, been made specially for her in Jersey by\r\nher son’s orders, the unhappy girl turned deadly pale, and, murmuring\r\nthe word “clerc,” fell in a dead faint to the ground. The final shock,\r\nand sudden conviction that they had been harbouring her lover’s\r\nmurderer, being too much for her in her enfeebled condition, she died\r\nin a few moments.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gordier misinterpreted the poor girl’s grief, and, thinking it\r\nproceeded from a guilty conscience, intimated that it evidently shewed\r\nthat Rachel was an accomplice in the murder. Naturally the Maugers\r\nwere most indignant at such an unworthy aspersion on their daughter,\r\nand, after a violent scene, asked her to prove her statements. She\r\nreplied that the jewel their daughter was then wearing was one which\r\nwas purchased by her son before leaving Jersey, and she proved the\r\nfact by touching a secret spring and shewing his portrait concealed in\r\nthe locket. The Maugers, knowing that Gaillard had been the donor of\r\nthis jewel, and connecting “clerc,” the last word Rachel’s lips had\r\nuttered, with him, as being her father’s clerk, immediately sent for\r\nhim. On being confronted with the jewel, and asked to explain how it\r\ncame into his possession, he replied that he had purchased it from a\r\nJew, named Levi, who had for years paid periodical visits to the island\r\nas a pedlar. So Levi was then considered to be undoubtedly guilty, and\r\nwas taken into custody, but then, remorse, the fear of public shame,\r\nand also the conviction that, Rachel being dead nothing made life worth\r\nliving, so wrought on the miserable Gaillard, that the morning of the\r\nday on which Levi was to be brought before the Royal Court, he was\r\nfound dead, stabbed by his own hand.\r\n\r\nA letter was found on the table in his room confessing his guilt and\r\nreading thus: “None but those who have experienced the furious impulse\r\nof ungovernable love will pardon the crime which I have committed,\r\nin order to obtain the incomparable object by whom my passions were\r\ninflamed. But, Thou, O Father of Mercies! who implanted in my soul\r\nthese strong desires, wilt forgive one rash attempt to accomplish my\r\ndetermined purpose, in opposition, as it should seem, to thy Almighty\r\nProvidence.”[345]\r\n\r\n[344] “L’honorable Jean de la Marche, du bas, Commandant-en-Chef de\r\nla paroisse de St. Martin, voyant l’isle de Guernesey révoltée contre\r\nson Roi, et servant de préférence sous les drapeaux Français; ce\r\nvaillant homme, dis-je, ému par un esprit vraiment loyal, et secondé\r\npar l’honorable Messire Pierre de Sausmarez, James Guille, Jean de\r\nBlanchelande, Pierre Bonamy, Thomas Vauriouf, et Thomas Etibaut, qui\r\nallèrent partout chercher des secours, et tâchant de détruire tous\r\nles factieux, et animés d’un désir d’assister à leur bienfaiteur\r\npour reprendre le Château Cornet, assistés par les braves habitants\r\nde la petite Césarée; la paroisse de St. Martin leva et envoya\r\nquatre-vingt-sept hommes, qui se joignirent aux dites honorables\r\npersonnes, sous le commandement du dit noble Jean de la Marche, du bas;\r\nce nombre était autant que la paroisse de St. Martin pût en fournir\r\ndans ce temps là. Ayant été attaqués au Mont Madau (dit les Hubits) ils\r\nfirent retraite et s’embarquèrent à la petite Porte (qui porte ce nom\r\nà cause de cette aventure) sur de frèles barques, parmi les rochers,\r\net arrivèrent enfin à Jersey, et se joignirent sous le commandement de\r\nMessire Renaud de Carteret, Grand Gouverneur des Iles, et se battirent\r\nvailleusement sous les drapeaux de sa Majesté, après avoir échappé à\r\nla fureur d’une mer orageuse. St. Martin était la seule paroisse de\r\ncette isle de Guernesey, qui se garda sous l’obéissance du Roi, pour\r\nlesquels bons services, il plut à sa Majesté Charles II., leur accorder\r\nà leur requête le galon d’argent comme le plus noble. C’est alors que\r\nplusieurs habitants de St. Martin donnèrent leurs services pour leurs\r\nvies au susdit Renaud de Carteret, Gouverneur-en-Chef, et conçurent un\r\ntel mépris pour leurs pays qu’ils habitèrent Jersey. Lisez pour cela le\r\ndiscours que Charles II. donna au Parlement à son retour, et l’estime\r\net l’éloge qu’il fait de ces héros.”--_From an old document entitled\r\n“Touchant La Preséance d’Honneur chalengée, par Guernesé.”_\r\n\r\n[345] From Mrs. Le Patourel, Mr. Tourtel, and from my father, who had\r\nheard it from his father, and collated with the printed versions of the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE SEIGNEUR DE DAMÈQUE.\r\n\r\nThis second story is not at all well known, except among some of the\r\nvery old people at St. Martin’s. I will not mention the names of the\r\nmurderers, as descendants of the family still survive, and are among\r\nthe most respected of the country people.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighteenth century many French noblemen fled over\r\nhere, to escape the terrors of the French revolution. Among them was\r\na Seigneur de Damèque. (I have no idea whether or not whether this is\r\nthe correct spelling of his name, but it represents the pronunciation\r\nof the people). He came out to St. Martin’s parish, and took a house at\r\nLe Hurel, just above Le Vallon. He was very proud and reserved, made no\r\nfriends, and was always seen going for long solitary walks, or pacing\r\ndown “Les Olivettes,” (the old name for what is now known as “the water\r\nlane”) or underneath “Les Rochers,” the cliffs on which the Manor House\r\nof Blanchelande now stands, and resting by the “douït” where the pond\r\nat Le Vallon now is, but which, in those days, was public property.\r\n\r\nHe was always very richly dressed, and was supposed to have hidden\r\nhoards of wealth, as well as to carry large sums of money on his\r\nperson. There were two or three brothers who lived together in a house\r\nnear Le Varclin, who, tempted by his supposed riches, and thinking\r\nthat his isolation would prevent his disappearance being noticed or\r\nenquiries being made, decided on following him on one of his solitary\r\nrambles and on murdering him. These brothers had always borne a bad\r\nreputation; they gambled and drank, and were the “vauriens” of an\r\notherwise respectable family.\r\n\r\nSo, one evening, they followed him, as, passing above La Petite Porte,\r\nhe entered into the narrow lane, overgrown with trees and thorn bushes,\r\nwhich leads to Jerbourg Point. There they closed upon him, and, being\r\ntwo or three to one, murdered him, and, after having robbed the body of\r\nhis watch, rings, etc., buried the corpse under some of the heaps of\r\nstones which lie on the waste lands at the top of the cliff.\r\n\r\nSome wonder was caused at Le Hurel when he failed to appear, but the\r\nrumour was started that he had been seen sailing away in a little\r\nfishing boat he used to hire for the season, from Bec du Nez, and which\r\nthe murderers had had the forethought to scuttle and sink. The country\r\npeople thought he had returned to his native land, and all interest in\r\nthe matter dropped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Haunted Lane near Jerbourg.]\r\n\r\nBut there was one man to whom M. de Damèque’s disappearance meant\r\nmuch. In Paris he had left a dear friend, a Dr. Le Harrier. These two\r\nmen wrote to each other regularly, and when M. de Damèque’s letters\r\nsuddenly ceased, letters came to Le Hurel from this doctor, asking for\r\nexplanations--letters which were never answered. Among M. de Damèque’s\r\njewellery was a beautiful and most uncommon watch, with either his\r\ncoronet and monogram or his coronet and arms displayed on the case.\r\nOne day, some years after his disappearance, Dr. Le Harrier, walking\r\nthrough the streets of Paris, saw this unmistakable watch hanging in\r\na jeweller’s shop. He went in and asked the man how it had got into\r\nhis possession, and the man told him it had been brought by some men\r\nfrom Guernsey, who had been trying to sell it in England, Holland, and\r\nBelgium, and finally had left it with him to dispose of. Dr. Le Harrier\r\nbought the watch, and, taking the men’s address, started at once for\r\nGuernsey. When he arrived he made enquiries, and, finding that these\r\nmen bore a bad reputation, took some constables with him and went to\r\nthe house. There they found them sodden with drink, and, haunted by\r\nfear and remorse when they saw the watch, they sank down on their knees\r\nand confessed everything, and were led off then and there to prison.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to be done was to disinter the bones of the murdered\r\nman and give them Christian burial. Heavily handcuffed the brothers\r\nwere taken to the spot, accompanied by various members of the clergy, a\r\ndoctor, who had to certify that every bone was there, (this is a point\r\nmuch dwelt upon by every teller of the story), Dr. Le Harrier, and all\r\nthe people of St. Martin’s. Then the bones, being found, were placed in\r\na coffin, and reverently buried in St. Martin’s churchyard.\r\n\r\nAfter the last spadeful of earth had been put in the grave, and while\r\nhandcuffed prisoners and all the bystanders were still present, an old\r\nSt. Martin’s man, named Pierre Jehan, got up and made the following\r\nspeech, which I have written down word for word as the people still\r\ntell it.\r\n\r\n_“Autrefois quand on enterrait des dépouilles mortelles on y envoyait\r\ndes rameaux et des bouquets de fleurs. Aujourd’hui on ne voit rien de\r\ntout ça.”_\r\n\r\n_“Autrefois on aurait donné un quartier de froment en fonds d’héritage\r\npour porter le nom de ----. Aujourd’hui on en donnera quatre pour ne le\r\npas porter.”_\r\n\r\n(“Formerly when burying a corpse one sent branches of trees and\r\nbouquets of flowers. To-day there is nothing of that.”\r\n\r\n“Formerly one would have given a quarter of wheat rent to bear the name\r\nof ----. To-day one would give four not to bear it.”)\r\n\r\nThe shock and the shame were such that the brothers were seized by what\r\nthe people call “a stroke,” and to the relief of their relations died\r\nin prison before being brought for trial.\r\n\r\nThat the ghosts of these two murdered men should revisit the scenes\r\nof the crime was only to be expected, but finally, when La Petite\r\nPorte was shut to sand-eelers by reason of “_ces cris terribles_,”\r\nsome of the neighbours and fishermen began to wonder whether nothing\r\ncould be done to lay these unquiet spirits and free the bay from its\r\nsupernatural visitants.\r\n\r\nThere was a man called Pierre Thoume, who lived at Les Blanches,\r\nmost popular in the parish, being ready to go everywhere and join in\r\neverything, though he was emphatically a “bon Chrétien.” He was a\r\ndistant relative of the murderers of M. de Damèque, and, having heard\r\nthese noises at various times, it was borne in upon him that perhaps if\r\nhe could find out what the ghost wanted, he could fulfil its wishes,\r\nand so let it rest in peace. He even prayed for guidance, and more\r\nand more he felt it to be his duty to go and meet the ghost face to\r\nface. At first some other men said they would join him, but when the\r\nappointed night came their spirits failed them, and no one arrived at\r\nthe rendezvous. Undaunted, and armed only with his Bible, Mr. Thoume\r\nsallied forth alone at midnight. I think it is difficult to realise\r\nwhat moral and physical courage it must have involved to go forth\r\nalone to encounter the supernatural, fully persuaded of its unearthly\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning he returned to his home, looking very white, and\r\nwith a curiously set expression on his face. His wife and daughters,\r\nwho had waited up for him, rushed at him to know what had happened, but\r\nhe said, “You must never ask me what has happened, what I have seen,\r\nwhat I have done. I have sworn to keep it a secret, and as a secret\r\nit will die with me, but this I can tell you, you may go to La Petite\r\nPorte at any hour of the day or night, and never again shall any ghost\r\nhaunt it, or noise or scream be heard.” And to this day the noises have\r\nutterly ceased.\r\n\r\nPierre Thoume kept his vow, though his family, friends, and neighbours,\r\nimplored him time after time, even on his death bed, to tell them what\r\nhe had seen. His invariable reply was, “I have given my word, and I\r\nwill not break it.”[346]\r\n\r\n[346] From Mrs. Rowswell, Mr. Thoume’s daughter, Mrs. Le Patourel,\r\nMrs. Charles Marquand, Margaret Mauger, Mr. Tourtel, and many others,\r\ninhabitants of St. Martin’s parish.\r\n\r\n\r\nLES CÂCHES.\r\n\r\nThere are two houses called Les Câches in St. Martin’s parish,\r\nsituated one behind the other in the district so called, between the\r\nblacksmith’s forge at St. Martin’s and the Forest Road. Tradition says\r\nthat they all formed part of one property, which extended as far as\r\nSt. Martin’s Church, and was a nunnery, the nuns having a private lane\r\nof their own by which they could go to the church without the fear of\r\nmeeting any men _en route_. There is a pond situated to the left of a\r\nlong avenue which now leads to the front door of one of the houses,\r\nand for years it was believed that on a certain night of the year,\r\na woman’s figure, dressed in grey, is seen walking up and down the\r\navenue, weeping and wringing her hands, and then rushing to the pond.\r\nThe story the people tell to account for this appearance is, that one\r\nof the nuns was discovered at the dead of night trying to drown her\r\nchild and herself in the pond. They were rescued, but only for a worse\r\nfate, for the unfortunate woman and child were bricked up in a cupboard\r\nwhich is now situated in one of the outhouses, but is supposed to have\r\nbeen the old refectory. The people also tell in confirmation of this\r\nstory that the night the ghost is seen this cupboard door flies open of\r\nitself though it is quite impossible to force it open at any other time.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that if this was an ecclesiastical establishment, it was\r\none of those alien priories of which Sir Edgar MacCulloch says:--\r\n\r\n“After the loss of Normandy the inconvenience of having so many\r\nvaluable possessions in the hands of the enemy, led to the suppression\r\nof these priories, and in these islands, whenever there was war between\r\nEngland and France, alien ecclesiastics were compelled to leave.”\r\n\r\nSo probably the old conventual buildings, if there were any, were\r\nallowed to fall into ruins, and the land passed into the hands of the\r\nPatrys, and thence, through the marriage of Marguerite Patrys and\r\nPierre Bonamy, into the possession of the Bonamys, who owned it for\r\nmany centuries. There is an old document which tells the story of how\r\nthe Bonamys first came to Guernsey.\r\n\r\n“On their return from the Holy Land, whither they had accompanied the\r\nKing of France, two brothers were driven by a violent storm, and thrown\r\ninto a little bay, where their bark went to pieces. In gratitude for\r\ntheir preservation they made a vow to remain where Providence had\r\nplaced them. One, a priest, founded a church, and the other married and\r\nfounded the Bonamy family.” In 1495, John Bonamy, son of Pierre and\r\nMarguerite Patrys, was “Procureur du Roi” in Guernsey, and his old MS.\r\nmemorandum book still survives, in which he describes a pilgrimage to\r\nRome he made in 1504, through France and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts relative to building Les Câches have been\r\ndeciphered from the old crabbed manuscript by Colonel J. H. Carteret\r\nCarey:--\r\n\r\n_1468.--M^{o} des gans quy mont aydy a caryer la pere … et des grant\r\nroquez … de le Cluse Luet--premez Gylome robert j jo^{r} &c._\r\n\r\n_1498.--M^{o} que je marchande de Colas Fyquet po^{r} ma meson, le\r\nbut deverz le nort … par la some de viij escus.… Il comencest le\r\nxviij^{eme} jo^{r} du moys de Maye--le Mardyt._\r\n\r\n_1504.--M^{o} que Gylome le Corvar et Colin Savage comancer acovyr ma\r\ngrange landeman du jo_{r} Saint Appolyne.

He was one of the richest men in Guernsey, and kept,\r\nas well as cows and horses, a large flock of sheep, there being much\r\ndemand for wool in those days on account of the quantity of jerseys,\r\nstockings, &c., knitted over here. One night he and his daughter went\r\nto a ball in the town. Tradition even goes so far as to say that Miss\r\nBonamy was dressed in white brocade. Before starting, Helier Bonamy\r\nsummoned his herdsmen, and told them to keep a sharp look out after\r\nhis sheep, for that there were many lawless men about. Helier and his\r\ndaughter[348] walked home that night earlier than was expected.\r\n\r\nAs they turned into the avenue, between high hedges and forest trees,\r\nthey heard the bleatings of sheep in pain. “_Écoute donc, ce sont\r\nmes berbis_” (Listen, those are my sheep), said Helier, and drew his\r\ndaughter under the hedge to listen. Peeping through the bushes they saw\r\nhis herdsman and farm labourers calling each other by name, drinking,\r\ntalking and laughing, and, while cutting the throats of the defenceless\r\nsheep, chanting in chorus:--\r\n\r\n    _“Rasons! rasons! les berbis_\r\n    _Du grand Bonamy,_\r\n    _S’il était ichin d’vànt,_\r\n    _Nou l’i en feraït autant!”_\r\n\r\n    (Shear! shear! the sheep,\r\n    Of the great Bonamy,\r\n    Were he here before us,\r\n    We would do as much to him).\r\n\r\nThey crept up the avenue unobserved to the house, for Helier was afraid\r\nto confront all these men who had evidently been drinking heavily,\r\nalone and unarmed. The next day his herdsman came to him with a long\r\nface, and said that robbers had broken into the sheepfold in the night\r\nand killed all the sheep, and brought up the other men as witnesses.\r\nMr. Bonamy said nothing, except that he would like all these men to\r\naccompany him down to the Court to there testify to the robbery. This\r\nthey did, and when they got there and told their story, Mr. Bonamy and\r\nhis daughter then turned round and denounced them. They were taken into\r\ncustody, and hanged shortly afterwards at St. Andrew’s.[349]\r\n\r\nThere are several stories illustrating the re-appearance of people\r\nwhose dying wishes had been disregarded by their survivors, and also of\r\npeople wishing to tell their heirs where their treasure had been hid.\r\n\r\nAt the King’s Mills, a Mrs. Marquand died, and left instructions with\r\nher husband that her clothes were to be given to her sister Judith.\r\nAfter her death the widower did not do it, so every night her ghost\r\ncame and knocked at her husband’s door. One night she rapped so loudly\r\nthat all the neighbours opened their windows, and heard her say:--\r\n\r\n“_Jean, combien de temps que tu me feras donc souffrir, donne donc mes\r\nhardes à ma sœur Judi_.”\r\n\r\n(John, how much longer wilt thou make me suffer, give then my clothes\r\nto my sister Judy).\r\n\r\nHe gave the clothes the next day, and the spirit returned no more.[350]\r\n\r\nAlmost the same story is told of a Mrs. Guille, who gave orders that\r\nafter her death a certain amount of clothes were to be bought and\r\nyearly distributed amongst the poor. This her husband neglected to\r\ncomply with, so Mrs. Guille visited him one night, and told him that\r\nshe would do so every night until the clothes were given. Mr. Guille\r\nhurriedly bought and distributed the clothes, and continued to do so\r\nyearly until he died.[351]\r\n\r\nMiss Le Pelley also contributes the following ghost stories which are\r\ntold at St. Pierre-du-Bois:--\r\n\r\n“About the beginning of the century a man went to Gaspé (which the\r\nnarrator said was Newfoundland, but is really on the mainland). While\r\nthere, his father died suddenly, and the son came back to Guernsey to\r\nwork the farm. One night his father appeared to him and told him that\r\nhe would find “_une petite houlette_” (a little mug) on the barn wall,\r\nwith something of value in it. Next morning the son went to look, and\r\nfound a mug full of five franc pieces.”\r\n\r\n“A widow in Little Sark had sold her sheep advantageously and hidden\r\nthe money in the “_poûtre_” (the large central rafter which runs along\r\nthe ceiling of the kitchen). Quite suddenly she died. Whenever her son\r\nwalked about in Little Sark he met his mother, which made him feel very\r\nfrightened, so one day he made his brother come with him, and together\r\nthey met her, and plucked up courage enough to say:--‘In the name of\r\nthe Great God what ails you,’ so then, having been spoken to first, she\r\ncould tell them where her hoard of treasure was, and then disappeared,\r\nand was never seen again.”\r\n\r\nThe whole country-side is full of shreds of ghost stories and beliefs;\r\nmany of these were probably due to, and encouraged by, the smugglers of\r\nolden days.\r\n\r\nFor instance a funeral procession was supposed to issue from an old\r\nlane south of Le Hurel--now blocked up--and no St. Martin’s man or\r\nwoman would dare pass the place at night. But smugglers, creeping\r\nalong between the overhanging hedges, with kegs and bundles on their\r\nshoulders, would have had just the same effect, especially to people\r\nwho would have been far too frightened at an unexpected nocturnal\r\nappearance to stop and investigate the matter.\r\n\r\nAt the corner between Les Maindonneaux and the Hermitage, a tall figure\r\nwas said to appear, and hover round the spot. When the road was widened\r\nand the wall round the Hermitage was built, a stone coffin was found\r\nfull of very large bones. These bones were taken to the churchyard, and\r\nthe burial service read over them, and since then no ghost has been\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThen, a little further on, around the pond of Sausmarez Manor, was seen\r\nan old man, dressed in a long grey coat, and a grey felt plumed hat.\r\nThis is supposed by the people to be old Mr. Matthew de Sausmarez--“Le\r\nGrand Matthieu” as he is called,--but why he is supposed to return is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nEven now-a-days, in quite modern most unghostly-looking houses, you\r\nhear tales of little old women, former inhabitants, being seen. In\r\nanother house, where a suicide is known to have occurred, soft finger\r\nknocks are heard against the walls of one of the rooms, as of some\r\none shut up in the room and seeking release; the door is opened, and\r\nnothing is to be seen. And in St. Martin’s the ghost of a woman, who\r\nonly died a few years ago, is said to haunt the garden of the house\r\nin which she lived. Her daughter saw the appearance and was picked up\r\nin a dead faint from fright, but then the woman was supposed by all\r\nthe neighbours to have been a witch, and, of course, as they say, the\r\nspirit of “une sorcière” could not rest quiet in consecrated ground.\r\n\r\nI will close this chapter on ghosts with a story which is firmly\r\nbelieved and told by many of the country people. For obvious reasons I\r\nsuppress all names.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, a very rich widower had a\r\nhouse in Smith Street. His first wife had left many small children,\r\nto whom in her lifetime she had been devoted, and spent many hours of\r\nher day in the nursery. The widower, after a short interval, married\r\nagain, a young, pretty, and frivolous girl, who utterly neglected\r\nher step-children. Then the spirit of his first wife came back for a\r\nshort time every morning, and washed and dressed them, the curtains of\r\ntheir beds were found pushed back in the mornings, and her silk dress\r\nwas heard rustling up the stairs, and the children used to say “Mamma\r\ndressed us.”[352]\r\n\r\nA man residing on the north-west coast had a brother who was drowned\r\nwhilst out fishing. This man, wishing to do his best for his brother’s\r\nfamily, was sore perplexed some years afterwards, as the family ran\r\ngreat risk of losing their property, owing to the absence of a title\r\ndeed which he knew to have existed, but which unfortunately had not\r\nbeen registered.\r\n\r\nOne day, when out fishing, he was greatly surprised to see his\r\nbrother’s boat coming full sail close to him and just rounding to, with\r\nhis brother at the tiller, and exclaimed:--“La! te v’lo et ta femme\r\nqu’est r’mariaïe!” (Lo! there you are and your wife married again!)\r\nThe answer he received was:--“Le papier que tu trache est dans un taï\r\nendret sus la poutre,” (the paper you are looking for is in such a\r\nroom, on the beam). Immediately everything disappeared.\r\n\r\nArrived ashore, he searched in the place indicated and found the\r\nmissing document.[353]\r\n\r\n[347] On referring to the Bonamy pedigree, the only Helier Bonamy who\r\nappears to have owned Les Câches, is a “Hellier, fils Pierre.” Peter\r\nBonamy being a Jurat in 1548. Helier does not seem to have borne the\r\nbest of reputations, for Nicholas Bermis writes of him to Bishop Horn:\r\n“Guernsey, December 13, 1575. He is a disorderly character, notorious\r\nfor impiety and obstinacy.… Finally publicly excommunicated from the\r\ncommune of the Church of God and of His Saints and given over to Satan\r\nuntil he should repent.”--_Zurich Letters_, Vol. II., p. 224.\r\n\r\n[348] Even into the nineteenth century the old ladies would tell\r\nyou how they walked home, lit by a three-candled lantern from “the\r\nAssemblys” and how the last dance was always given to the favourite\r\npartner, so that he might have the privilege of accompanying them.\r\n\r\n[349] From Miss C. Tardif, who was told the story by her grandmother.\r\n\r\n[350] Collected by Miss E. Le Pelley.\r\n\r\n[351] Collected by Miss E. Le Pelley.\r\n\r\n[352] From Mrs. Le Patourel, and also told to Miss Le Pelley by an old\r\nwoman at St. Pierre-du-Bois.\r\n\r\n[353] From John de Garis, Esq., of the Rouvêts, whose father was told\r\nthe story by the man himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B. Witchcraft.\r\n\r\n    Referred to on page 386.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIE PIPET.\r\n\r\nThere are many stories still told and firmly believed by the country\r\npeople, of Marie Pipet, who was a noted “sorcière“ of the early part of\r\nthe nineteenth century. She came of a race of witches and wizards, thus\r\ndescribed in Redstone’s _Guernsey and Jersey Guide_, by Louisa Lane\r\nClarke, (Second Edition, 1844), p. 86.\r\n\r\n“On the road past St. Andrew’s Church, one of the lanes to the right\r\nleads to the village called “Le Hurel,”[354] a collection of mere\r\nhuts; rude, dirty looking cottages, but remarkable from the people who\r\ntenant it. They are a kind of half gipsy, half beggar race, bearing\r\nthe name of Pipet; and kept totally distinct from every other family,\r\nbecause no person would intermarry with them upon any consideration.\r\nTheir appearance and features are quite unlike the rest of the Guernsey\r\npeasantry, who are extremely good-looking, clean, and active; whereas\r\nthose Pipets may be found basking in the sun, with anything but a\r\nprepossessing exterior. The country people consider them as wizards and\r\nwitches, and, at certain times of the year, about Christmas, when they\r\nare privileged to go round and beg for their _Noël_, or “_irvières_”\r\n(New Year’s gifts), no one likes to send them away empty handed\r\nfor fear of the consequences to themselves, their cattle, or their\r\nchildren.” Even to this day the country people have a great dread of\r\n“Les Pipiaux.”[355]\r\n\r\nMy father’s old nurse, Margaret Mauger, told me that the cook at old\r\nMr. Fred Mansell’s, of the Vauxbelets, (about the year 1850), was a\r\ngreat friend of hers, and told her that one day Marie Pipet came into\r\nthe Vauxbelets kitchen, and demanded some favour which was refused.\r\n“_Tu t’en repentiras_,” she said, and went out of the door and sat on\r\nthe adjoining hedge to await developments. Meanwhile the sirloin which\r\nwas being cooked for Mr. Mansell’s dinner refused to be cooked! For\r\nhours she turned it round and round on the jack in front of the fire.\r\nThe heat had apparently no effect on it, and it was as raw as when she\r\nfirst put it there. Finally, in despair, the cook went to her master,\r\nand told him what had happened. So he sent for Marie Pipet, and told\r\nher if she did not disenchant his dinner she would spend the night in\r\ngaol, (he was a Jurat of the Royal Court). With a curtsey she replied\r\nthat if he would go into his kitchen he would find his sirloin ready\r\nfor eating, and, at that moment, the cook declared, it suddenly turned\r\nbrown!\r\n\r\nThere are many stories told of Marie Pipet in St. Pierre-du-Bois. One\r\nold woman, Judith Ozanne, told Miss Le Pelley that Marie Pipet, “la\r\nsorcière,” once asked her grandmother, old Mrs. Ozanne, for some milk.\r\nThis was refused her, so she prevented the cows from eating, and they\r\nwere all pining away. So then her grandfather took his pitchfork, and,\r\ngoing straight to the witch, compelled her, under the fear of corporal\r\npunishment, to undo the spell.\r\n\r\nJudith Ozanne also tells the following story of Marie Pipet, which she\r\naffirms is true. One day Marie took her corn to the Grands Moulins (the\r\nKing’s Mills) to be ground. The two young men who were in charge of\r\nthe mill said “Oh dear no, they were not going to grind her corn,” and\r\nso she returned home, but the mill-stones turned round and round and\r\nround so quickly that no corn would grind, and nothing would stop them,\r\nso they had to call back Marie Pipet and promise to grind her corn for\r\nher, and, as soon as her corn was put in, the millstones worked as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nMr. Métivier gives a story of Marie Pipet which was current in his day,\r\nin his _Souvenirs Historiques de Guernesey_.\r\n\r\n“The incomparable Marie, so dreaded by the millers of the King’s Mills,\r\nbecause she often amused herself by unhinging our mills, rests in peace\r\non the good side (au bon côté) of the Castel churchyard.[356] It is\r\nfirmly believed, and frequently told, how she, and other members of\r\nher family, could metamorphose themselves as “cahouettes”--red-legged\r\nchoughs. One day, in the form of one of these birds, she was discovered\r\nin a cow stable, and run through the thigh by the proprietor of the\r\nstable, with his pitchfork. The bird managed to escape, but the woman\r\nMarie Pipet was obliged to keep her bed for six months with a terrible\r\nand mysterious wound in her leg, by which of course the metamorphosis\r\nwas proved.”[357]\r\n\r\nPossibly a bird of such evil omen, having red legs, accounts for the\r\nfact that to this day our country people tell you that all witches who\r\ngo to dance at the Catioroc wear red stockings.[358]\r\n\r\nAll witches are supposed to be endowed with the faculty of keeping the\r\nperson they have bewitched walking--walking, for hours perhaps, in a\r\ncircle, to which they cannot find a clue.\r\n\r\nMarie Pipet, one day being offended with a man, made him walk backwards\r\nand forwards one whole night between the Vauxbelets and St. Andrew’s\r\nChurch.[359]\r\n\r\n[354] _Hure_, _Hurel_, and _Huret_, all frequently met with\r\nas place-names in Guernsey, mean “rocky ground.”--Métivier’s\r\n_Dictionnaire_.\r\n\r\n[355] The Guernsey people have a way of making plurals of many words\r\nending in “et” or “ert” or “el,” by substituting “iaux,” as:--Pipets =\r\nPipiaux, Robert (a very common surname) Robiaux, Coquerel = Coqueriaux,\r\nbouvet, bouviaux, touffet, touffiaux.\r\n\r\n[356] In Guernsey the south side of our churchyard was “le bon côté.”\r\nThe north side, (according to the old Norse mythology, where hell and\r\nits attendant demons were situated in the _north_) was reserved for\r\ncriminals, suicides, etc.\r\n\r\n[357] The “Cahouettes” or red-legged choughs, have always, according\r\nto Mr. Métivier (see his _Dictionnaire_, art. “Cahouettes”), played a\r\nprominent rôle in the Néo-Latin mythology. According to the Council\r\nof Nismes, 1281, witches and wizards metamorphosed themselves into\r\n“Cahouets” and “Cahouettes.” Raphaël, Archbishop of Nicosia, capital of\r\nthe island, excommunicated all _cahouets_ and _cahouettes_, as well as\r\nall who maintained and encourage games of chance.\r\n\r\n[358] From Margaret Mauger, who also said that in her youth if one met\r\nan old woman in the town wearing red stockings, it was always said\r\n“_V’là une des sorcières du Catioroc!_” In Holbein’s _Crucifixion_,\r\n1477, now at Augsberg, a devil which carries off the soul of the\r\nimpenitent thief has the head of an ape, bat-wings, and _flaming red\r\nlegs_.\r\n\r\n[359] From Margaret Mauger.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIZARD OF SARK.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of the eighteenth century there lived in Sark a very\r\nnotorious wizard called Pierre de Carteret. An old Sark woman called\r\nBetsy Hamon, now Mrs. de Garis, has given Miss Le Pelley, whose servant\r\nshe is, the following particulars concerning him:--\r\n\r\nPierre de Carteret, called “le vieux diable,” lived in Sark. He always\r\nworked at night, and when the fishermen passed by his house at night\r\nthey heard him talking to the little devils who worked for him. They\r\ncould not understand, for it was the devil’s language they talked. He\r\nbuilt a boat in a barn in one morning, and the Sark people were amazed\r\nto see it launched in the Creux harbour. This was Black Art, for the\r\nboat was too large to go out of the door, and also his house was not\r\nquite close to the sea.\r\n\r\nHe was very rich, partly owing to his having no expenses, as he had no\r\nworkmen to pay, everything being done for him by these little devils,\r\nand partly from his first wife, whom he courted in France. Pierre went\r\nover to France alone, in a small open boat. The girl he married, who\r\nwas herself a lady, thought he was of gentle blood. After he married\r\nher he was most cruel, and spoilt all her furniture. For instance, her\r\nparlour was mirrored from ceiling to floor, and he brought her horses\r\nup into the room, and the poor things became excited when they saw\r\nother horses, and kicked the looking-glasses and broke all the other\r\nfurniture. This wife died of a broken heart, and for his second wife\r\nPierre married a Sark girl, little more than a child.\r\n\r\nIf Pierre wanted his hedges repaired he simply gave the order to\r\nhis little helpers, and the next morning they were done. Pierre’s\r\ndaughter--“la petite Betsy”--used to feed the cow at night in the\r\nchurchyard, and she was seen returning home at daybreak with the cow,\r\nlooking thoroughly well fed. Consequently nobody would buy butter or\r\nmilk from him.\r\n\r\nWhen Pierre had nothing else to give his workers to do they used to\r\nforge money, and their hammers could be heard by the passers by.[360]\r\n\r\nOld Mrs. Le Messurier, in Sark, also confirmed a great many of these\r\ndetails in 1896. She said he, Pierre de Carteret, was well known to\r\nbe a famous sorcerer. He had pictures of the Devil on his walls, and\r\nlittle images of Satan were found in his house after his death, and\r\npromptly burnt by the incomers. He could build a boat, alter a loft, or\r\nbuild a wall in a single night, because he had “des esprits malins” to\r\nhelp him. He was an excessively bad man and used to smuggle ball and\r\nammunition to France, to help the French against the English in the\r\nwar. The English found him out and came over with bayonets to take him,\r\nbut he hid down his well, and could not be found.\r\n\r\nOut at St. Pierre-du-Bois they still tell the tale of a Frenchman, who\r\nwas a “sorcier,” and in league with the Devil.\r\n\r\nOne day he entered a farm kitchen, where he found all the young people\r\nplaying a game, in which they used a number of doubles, placed in a jam\r\npot, for counters.\r\n\r\nHe said “I can turn all those doubles into mice.”\r\n\r\nThey did not believe him, so he took the pot, shook it, and turned it\r\nupside down on the table. Then he turned to one of the girls standing\r\nby and said “Now, take up that pot.” She did so, and numbers of mice\r\nran out of it, all over the table, with their tails cocked up!\r\n\r\nOf the same man another story is told. One morning he wanted some of\r\nhis neighbours to play cards with him, but they said they could not\r\nspare the time, for they must weed their parsnips.\r\n\r\nHe replied--“If you will come, your parsnips shall be weeded by dinner\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\nSo they played, but one man looked up, and saw through the window\r\nnumbers and numbers of little demons weeding very quickly, and by\r\nmid-day the work was done.[361]\r\n\r\nMr. J. Linwood Pitts has also collected two stories bearing on the\r\nsubject of the transformation of witches, both of which were related to\r\nhim in perfect good faith by reliable witnesses.\r\n\r\nMany years ago a Guernsey gentleman went over to Sark. While sitting\r\non the cliffs above the Havre Gosselin he noticed a flock of birds,\r\nprincipally wild duck, circling round and round. He fired off his\r\nmusket, but did not succeed in hitting any of them, or even, much to\r\nhis astonishment, in frightening them away.\r\n\r\nHe thought there must be something mysterious about them, as wild duck\r\nare generally such shy birds, so he consulted a noted wizard, who told\r\nhim that if he loaded his musket with a piece of silver having a cross\r\non it it would take effect on any transformed witch. So he went over\r\nto Sark again with this silver bullet, and on returning to the Havre\r\nGosselin again saw the birds. He picked out one, which seemed the\r\nfinest of the flock, and apparently their leader. On firing at it he\r\nsucceeded in winging it, though it disappeared, and he thought it had\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nThat evening, on the return boat to Guernsey, a girl on board, who\r\nused to pay almost daily visits to Sark, and about whom there were\r\nmany mysterious reports, appeared with a bad wound in her hand, about\r\nwhich she would vouchsafe no explanation, but looking very white and\r\nfrightened. The man identified her in his own mind as the mysterious\r\nbird, but did not speak about the affair till long after.\r\n\r\n[360] From Miss Le Pelley, who wrote it down word for word as it was\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n[361] Collected by Miss Le Pelley.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WITCH OF ALDERNEY.\r\n\r\nA very respectable Alderney man used to tell old Mr. Barbenson,\r\nWesleyan minister, about a noted Alderney witch.\r\n\r\nHe declared that one night, passing by her cottage, he looked in, and\r\nsaw a blue flame blazing up, and the witch dancing in the middle of it,\r\nsurrounded by little devils, also dancing.\r\n\r\n“But how do you know that they were devils?” Mr. Barbenson\r\nasked:--“Because they were just like the pictures of Apollyon in my old\r\n_Pilgrim’s Progress_” was the reply. Another day, he said that, coming\r\nhome from milking, he saw two large black birds revolving over his\r\nhead. They both sank, almost at his feet, behind a small furze bush.\r\nSuddenly this woman rose up from behind the same bush, and ran away.\r\nHe said the bush was made too small to hide the woman, and that it was\r\nquite impossible that she could have been concealed there. The man\r\nvouched for the truth of these stories.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitts has also kindly allowed me to include the following extract\r\nfrom an old MS. which was communicated to him by Mr. E. P. Le Feuvre, a\r\ngentleman of Jersey extraction, residing in London, and connected with\r\nsome of our Guernsey families.\r\n\r\nHe also gave me the details of a remarkable local witch story, which\r\nhe had found in a curious old MS. in the library of Dr. Witham, of\r\nGordon Square, London. This MS., which is in two volumes folio, is\r\nentitled ‘_Icones Sacræ Gallicanæ et Anglicanæ_,’ and contains seventy\r\nbiographies of ministers and clergymen. Among them is a sketch of the\r\nlife of the Rev. Daniel Fautrat, of Guernsey, who was minister of the\r\nCâtel parish; then of Torteval; and who afterwards, in 1633 (in the\r\nreign of Charles I.), succeeded Mr. de la Marche, at St. Peter-Port.\r\nThis MS. is by a John Quick (born 1636--died 1706). There were two\r\nFautrats, Helier and Daniel, father and son, and the biographer\r\nsomewhat confuses them.[362] This story of the witch--who was burnt\r\nalive in the Bordage during Daniel Fautrat’s ministry at the Town\r\nChurch--is a very curious one, and is a decided acquisition to the\r\nwitch-lore of the island. It is as follows:--\r\n\r\nTHE WITCH AND THE RAVEN.\r\n\r\n“After Monsieur [Daniel] Ffautrat had spent some years at Torteval and\r\nSt. Andrew’s [Guernsey] he was, upon the death of Monsr. de la Marche,\r\ncalled to succeed him in ye Pastorall charge of St. Peters Port, [in\r\n1634, in the reign of Charles I.] which is ye Towne of this Island, a\r\nfair Markett Towne and priviledged with ye Sessions of ye whole Island,\r\nwhere all caisses Civill and Criminall are finally tryed and determined\r\nin ye Playderoye,[363] by ye Bayliffe and Jurates.\r\n\r\n“During his ministry in this Towne, and about ye year 1640 [Charles\r\nI.] there happened a most remarkable event. Divines do say that it is\r\na very rare thing for witches under Gospell Light to repent; and some\r\nhave given this reason of their assertion--because they have committed\r\nthat unpardonable sin against ye Holy Ghost. I cannot tell, but that\r\nthis following story seems to confirm it.\r\n\r\n“There was a certain woman of this Island, above four-score years\r\nof age, who had been imprisoned, indicted and found guilty upon\r\nfull evidence, of that abominable sin of witchcraft, and for it was\r\ncondemned to death. She gave out confidently that she should not dye.\r\nHowever, she is carried from prison to ye appointed place of Execution\r\nto be burnt alive.\r\n\r\n“All the way, as she was going thither, a great Black Raven was seen\r\nhovering, and heard croaking after a dolefull manner over her head,\r\ntill she came to ye stake. And now, while they be fastening ye chain,\r\nshe begs of one of the Bystanders to give her a clew of thread, which\r\nhaving received, she fastens one end of it to her girdle, and taking\r\nye other end, she flings it with her hand up into ye aire. The Raven,\r\nstooping down, catcheth at it with his Beak, and, mounting, carrys with\r\nhim ye old witch from ye bottom of ye vale up into ye air. A young man\r\nof that Island, seeing her flying, being on ye top of ye hill, flings\r\nhis Halbard so exactly betwixt her and ye raven, that it cuts ye thread\r\nasunder, and ye old witch is taken by him, but with many fearfull\r\nimprecations upon him, she vomityng out whole cartloads of curses\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n“However, she is once again carryed down to ye stake, and there\r\naccordingly executed, being burnt to ashes. But this poor officious\r\nwardour, whose name was Gosslin--ye holy wise providence of God so\r\npermitting it--felt a short time after, ye bitter consequences of her\r\nrage and dying curses; for he grew sick of an incurable disease, lying\r\nunder most exquisite torments, of which he could never be relieved by\r\nany means or medicines, till having languished some years he was at\r\nlast released from his sufferings by death.”\r\n\r\n“A girl was very ill, and the doctor did not know what was the matter\r\nwith her, and, though he tried many remedies, none succeeded. One day a\r\nfriend from the Vale, their native parish, called, and told the girl’s\r\nmother privately that the girl was bewitched, and that it was Mrs. ----\r\nwho had done it, but that he could, with certain herbs, boiled in a\r\nparticular manner, cause the witch to die, and then the girl would be\r\nwell. The herbs were boiled, and a few days afterwards the witch died.\r\nDuring the funeral the girl jumped joyfully out of bed, quite well.\r\nThis occurred within the last twenty years.”\r\n\r\n“One day, two boys, well on in their teens were chaffing an old witch,\r\nwhen suddenly she got very angry, threw dust in the air, and gabbled\r\nsome words very quickly. The boys went home and found they were covered\r\nwith vermin. They were near neighbours. One of the boys was so angry\r\nthat he took his gun and went to the old witch and said, “Now, take\r\naway the vermin, or I shoot you,” and he levelled his gun at her.\r\nThey parleyed a little, but the boy was so determined that the witch\r\nsuddenly took fright, threw dust in the air, repeated some words, and\r\nthe vermin disappeared. The other boy was covered for three days.”[364]\r\n\r\nThe following story illustrating the widespread belief in these special\r\npowers of witches and wizards was told me by Mrs. Le Patourel, of St.\r\nMartin’s, who was told the story by the heroine, and who vouched for\r\nits authenticity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Le Patourel’s mother-in-law was a Miss Mauger, of Saints, very\r\nhandsome and very well-to-do. In fact, she and her sister went to\r\nschool in England, which was considered very grand in those days. On\r\nher return from school she, her sister, and a friend, all went together\r\nto one of the country dances then frequently held in the various\r\nparishes. They all “held their heads very high,” dressed very well, and\r\nwould only dance with those whom they considered the “best” partners.\r\nThey were dressed on this occasion in silk dresses with large white\r\nlace collars and ruffles. At the beginning of the dance, as they were\r\nall sitting in a row together, some man came up and asked each of them\r\nin turn to dance, but they all considered him unworthy of the honour,\r\nand each refused to dance with him. As the last refused he turned on\r\nhis heel muttering that they would repent their rudeness. A minute or\r\ntwo later one of the girls leaned forward and cried to her sister, “Oh,\r\nMarie, what have you got there?” and pointed to an insect crawling\r\non her lace. Covered with confusion the girl killed it, only to see\r\nswarms more crawling after it. The other two girls then discovered to\r\ntheir horror that they were likewise covered with swarms of vermin, and\r\ncovered with shame and confusion they all had hurriedly to leave the\r\ndance. For three days they all remained in this condition, and then the\r\nvermin disappeared as suddenly as they came.\r\n\r\n“The shame of it I can never forget,” Mrs. Le Patourel says was the way\r\nher informant always ended the story. “But,” said Mrs. Le Patourel,\r\n“that is nothing to what people can do who use the bad books.”[365]\r\n\r\nShe thinks it is the French people who have brought these evil arts to\r\nGuernsey, and in proof of her theory told me this story which happened\r\nto one of her own friends, “who has told it to me many a time.”\r\n\r\nA Guernsey farmer living in St. Saviour’s parish had a French\r\nmanservant, who slept on the premises. Suspicion being aroused by his\r\nhaggard looks he was watched, and seen to leave the house every night\r\nand not come back till the morning. When asked where he had been and\r\nwhat he had been doing he returned evasive answers. So one night his\r\nmaster determined to follow him. He tracked him across some fields till\r\nhe reached the Catioroc, and there he saw him lie down in the middle of\r\na field, and then, in a few moments, a clear, bluish flame, like the\r\nflame of a candle, was seen issuing out of his mouth, and wandering\r\noff like a will-o’-the-wisp across the fields. When the astonished\r\nfarmer went up to the body he found it lying rigid and lifeless, and\r\nno amount of shaking or calling could make any impression on it. After\r\nsome time the flame was seen returning, and settled on the man’s mouth,\r\nand there disappeared, and shortly after the man sat up, looking dazed\r\nand tired, and absolutely declined to answer any of the questions with\r\nwhich his master greeted him.\r\n\r\nOn pp. 305 to 351 (ante) are given various trials for witchcraft, which\r\ntook place in Guernsey during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\r\nbut Sir Edgar MacCulloch has not included the following, which I have\r\nfound cited in an old MS. book compiled by Eleazar Le Marchant and\r\nPierre Careye between the years 1728 and 1743.\r\n\r\n“Le 26me Juillet 1594, pardevant Louis de Vick, baillif, et Messrs.\r\nNicholas Martin, sen., Guillaume de Beauvoir, André Henry, Jean Andros,\r\nJean de Sausmarez, Pierre de Beauvoir, Pierre Careye, William le\r\nMarchant, Nicholas Martin, jun., and François Allez, jurez.\r\n\r\n“Marie Martin, alias Salmon, fille Osmond, deubment atteinte et\r\nconvaincue d’avoir usé d’Art de Sorcelerie, dont elle a empoisonné,\r\ntourmenté et fait mourir jouxte sa propre et volontaire confession,\r\nAnne Careye[366], fem͠e de John de Vick, la fem͠e de Pierre Vodin,\r\nl’enfant de son oncle, Thomas Breton, l’enfant de John Briart, et deux\r\nenfants à Collas Nouell, et plusieurs bestes et autres maux, par elle\r\ncommis par le dit art de Sorcelerie, comme apparoist par les procédures\r\net enquestes sur ce passées. Est ajugée d’être aujourd’huy brulée\r\ntant que son corps soit reduit en cendres, et ses biens, meubles, et\r\nhéritages confisquées à la Majesté de la Royne, et est com͠andé aux\r\nofficiers de sa Majesté de voir la ditte execution être faitte, ainsi\r\nqu’ils en voudront répondre: et est après avoir en sur ceu l’advis et\r\nopinion de Henri de Beauvoir et John Effart, jurez.”\r\n\r\nThere are many other instances, which, did space permit, I could\r\nmention, of belief in witches and wizards, extending even down to\r\nthe present day. Animals dying from no visible cause, bread turned\r\nsour and uneatable, wounds mysteriously inflicted and incurable by\r\nphysicians, but at once healed by crossing running water, a woman sent\r\nmad by smelling a harmless-looking bouquet of flowers, and so on. Many\r\ninvolving the names of persons still living. For underneath the veneer\r\nof civilisation and education found in the island are the same old\r\nbeliefs and superstitions, as deeply cherished and ingrained as they\r\nwere in the days of Queen Elizabeth--“Plus ça change, plus c’est la\r\nmême chose.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I will give a few extracts respecting witchcraft from\r\nElie Brevint’s note book. Elie Brevint was born in 1586, became\r\nminister of Sark in 1612, and died in 1674.\r\n\r\n“Quelques uns tesmoignent avoir veu une nuée se lever d’Erm, et de là\r\ns’en aller sur le dongeon du Chasteau Cornet, où un certain Maugier\r\ndepuis bruslé pour sortiléges estoit lors prisonnier, et ladite nuée\r\ns’estre dissipée et esvanouie sur le dit Chasteau, et que les bateaux\r\npescheurs sur lesquels elle avoit passé avoyent cuide renversés.…”\r\n\r\n“Histoire d’un juge, qui ne croyoit point qu’il y eust de sorciers; il\r\nadvint qu’il luy mourut soudain plusieurs vaches et brebis. Pourtant\r\ndepuis cette perte, laquelle il imputoit à belles personnes, il fist\r\nrigoureuse justice de sorciers.…”\r\n\r\n“On dit que quelqu’un va à la graine de Feugère[367] quand par un\r\nlivre de magie, ou par quelque autre voye il a communication avec le\r\nDiable, qui luy baille des poudres pour attenter et commettre diverses\r\nmeschancetés, comme ouvrir serrures, violer femme et fille, &c., et\r\nfaut bailler à ce m͠re pour ces drogues une beste vive, comme chien ou\r\nchat, autrement il poursuit N. pour le faire mourir.”\r\n\r\n[362] The following is an abbreviated pedigree of the Fautrat family,\r\nshowing what close connections there were between the leading families\r\nin Guernsey and Jersey before the wars of the Commonwealth, when--the\r\nislands taking different sides--was established a feud which has never\r\nproperly been healed.\r\n\r\n                      PIERRE FAUTRAT  = … LE VAVASSEUR\r\n                     Took the oath of |\r\n                    allegiance to the |\r\n                    King of England   |\r\n                    in Jersey the 19th|\r\n                    of October, 1545. |\r\n                   +------------------+\r\n                   |\r\n             Cardin Fautrat = Jenette Coquerel\r\n                 Settled in | Daughter and heiress\r\n                 Guernsey.  | of Thomas Coquerel of\r\n                            | Guernsey and Jersey, and of\r\n                            | Jeanne de Vic, daughter\r\n                            | of Laurence de Vic\r\n                            | of Guernsey.\r\n             +--------------+--------+--+--+--+-----------+\r\n             |                       |  |  |  |           |\r\n           Jean = Bertranne Estur  Other Children.

He was buried in Westminster Abbey the 24th\r\nof November, 1672.\r\n\r\n[367] Graine de Feugère (fougère) = Fern seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C. Charms and Spells.\r\n\r\n    Referred to on page 421.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very old lady remembers, when a child, seeing some small bits of\r\nstick, shaped like slate-pencils, which old women wore sewn up in their\r\nstays as charms against witchcraft, on the homœopathic principle, for\r\nthey called them “_Des Bouais de Helier Mouton_,” Helier Mouton being\r\nhimself a noted sorcerer.\r\n\r\nWhen I mentioned this to Sir Edgar he told me that a hundred years ago\r\na man named Colin Haussin was put in the stocks for witchcraft and\r\nusing “_des petits bouais_.”\r\n\r\nThe following charms, etc., were collected for me in 1896-7, as still\r\ncurrent in the parish of St. Pierre-du-Bois, by Miss E. Le Pelley.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. THOMAS’ DAY.\r\n\r\nIf a girl wishes to know whom she will marry, on the eve of St. Thomas’\r\nDay she puts her shoes in the form of a T under her bed, and says, in\r\ngetting in:--\r\n\r\n    _“Saint Thomas, Saint Thomas,_\r\n    _Le plus court, le plus bas,_\r\n    _Fais moi voir en m’endormant_\r\n    _Celui qui sera mon amant,_\r\n    _Et le pays, et la contrée._\r\n    _Où il fait sa demeurée,_\r\n    _Et le métier qu’il sait faire._\r\n    _Devant moi qu’il vienne faire._\r\n    _Qu’il soit beau ou qu’il soit laid_\r\n    _Tel qu’il sera je l’aimerai._\r\n    _Saint Thomas, fait moi la grâce_\r\n    _Que je le voie, que je l’embrasse.”_\r\n                       _“Ainsi soit il.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDSUMMER EVE.\r\n\r\nA girl makes a dumb cake and puts it on a gridiron over the fire, and\r\nwatches it in silence between twelve and one o’clock at night, during\r\nwhich time the girl’s future husband arrives and turns the cake. The\r\nnarrator tried this, and when the cake was cooked on one side she heard\r\nsomeone walking clumsily upstairs. She was so frightened that she threw\r\nthe cake away and got into her mother’s bed and held tight on to her!\r\nYears afterwards she married and often recognised her husband’s step\r\nas the one she heard that Midsummer Eve. She very much repented having\r\ndone it, for she said it gives the poor man so much suffering being\r\nunder the charm.\r\n\r\nAnother charm for Midsummer Eve is this:--If a girl wishes to know the\r\nprofession of her future husband she must melt some lead in an iron\r\nspoon between twelve and one o’clock at night, and pour it in a tumbler\r\nof cold water, and then watch the shapes it takes, such as a sword\r\nwould denote that he would be a soldier, an anchor a sailor, etc., etc.\r\nShould she wish to know whether she is to be married or not, she must\r\nkill two pigeons, take out their hearts and roast them on skewers, also\r\nbetween twelve and one o’clock. If she is to be married she will see\r\nher intended, if she is not to be, some men will bring in a coffin.\r\nThere must be perfect silence the whole time. It once happened that, as\r\na girl was doing it, a coffin appeared. She screamed aloud, and the men\r\ncame up to her and began to put her in the coffin. But fortunately for\r\nher she fainted, and was quiet, and the men with the coffin could go\r\naway as they came.\r\n\r\nAnother charm against witchcraft is “_vif argent_” or quicksilver, but\r\ncamphor, white salt, or heather, are all good. The charm must be put\r\nin a small cotton or linen bag, two inches long by one and a half inch\r\nwide, and attached by a ribbon round the neck, so that the charm rests\r\nabove the heart. Red salt is used by witches in their incantations.\r\n\r\nThe following written charm was lent me to copy by Mr. Guille, one\r\nof the founders of the Guille-Allès Library. It is in the form of a\r\nletter, and he told me, when he was a boy, a copy existed in almost all\r\nthe old Guernsey farm houses.[368] I have transcribed it verbatim, with\r\nall its faults of spelling, punctuation, etc.\r\n\r\nL’ETTRE MIRACULEUSE.\r\n\r\n“Trouvé depuis peut par un Etudians au pied d’un Crusifix Miraculeux de\r\nla Ville d’Arrase Ecritte en Lettres d’Or de la propre main de notre\r\nSauveur et Redempteur Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nJESUS--MARIE.\r\n\r\nLes Dimanches vous ne ferez aucune œuvre n’y travail sur peine d’être\r\nmaudits de Moy.
