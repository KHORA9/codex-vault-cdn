It seeks to explain, as far as possible, the origin of the\r\nwords and music of every hymn in the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\nThe great lyrics of the church, contributed by every age since the days\r\nof the apostles, are a precious heritage, and a source of inspiration\r\nand power. This work is intended to foster an understanding of and love\r\nfor our hymns, new and old, and to stimulate the time-honored and\r\nblessed practice of congregational singing in the church today.\r\n\r\nThe _Handbook_ may be found useful as an aid (1) in the private study of\r\nhymns or their use in family devotions; (2) in selecting suitable hymns\r\nfor the many and varied services of public worship; (3) in preparing\r\nspecial music services or hymn sings where such occasions are planned to\r\nimprove the singing in the church; (4) for study groups in hymnology in\r\nchurches and schools. The historical development of hymnology may be\r\nfollowed in the brief “Introduction to Our Hymns and Tunes.”\r\n\r\nThe author has endeavored to make the work as comprehensive as possible\r\nwithout overburdening the reader with too many details. Many hymns have\r\ninteresting stories connected with their origin and use while others,\r\nequally valuable, were just written, without drama or incident, the poet\r\nscarcely knowing how or why, except that the Inner Voice spoke. The\r\napocryphal tales which have been circulated concerning some hymns have\r\nbeen studiously avoided. The aim has been to include only such material\r\nas seems to bear genuine marks of authenticity. The bibliography of\r\n“Principal Works Consulted,” found elsewhere in the book, indicates the\r\nmain sources.\r\n\r\nThe original versions of translated hymns are not always readily\r\navailable and for that reason they are reproduced in the _Handbook_.\r\nTranslated hymns are usually selections from a much larger number of\r\nstanzas and it is often instructive to be able to study the whole\r\nstructure of the original work.\r\n\r\n_Acknowledgements._ I wish to acknowledge valuable help received from\r\nthe following and to express hereby my gratitude to them: to Dr. Robert\r\nMcCutchan, author of _Our Hymnody_, who generously responded to my\r\nrequest for information on a dozen or more hymns on which I had no data;\r\nto Dr. Henry Wilder Foote, of Harvard University, author of _Three\r\nCenturies of American Hymnody_, for biographical material on several\r\nhymn writers, and the use of books from his private library; to Dr.\r\nReginald McAll, Executive Secretary of the Hymn Society of America for\r\nhelpful material; to Dr. Ruth Messenger, Archivist for the Hymn Society\r\nof America, who furnished nearly all the Latin originals, and the\r\nItalian original of Savonarola’s hymn, and information concerning these\r\nhymns; to Dr. Armin Heussler, author of a forth-coming handbook to the\r\n_Evangelical hymnal_, for material on several of the chorales; to Wm.\r\nRunyan of the Hope Publishing Company, and to Dr. John Trowbridge of the\r\nBible Institute of Los Angeles, for information concerning several of\r\nthe gospel songs; to Dr. Cornelius Krahn who made the rich hymnic\r\ntreasures of the Mennonite Historical Library at Bethel College\r\navailable to me; to the late Rev. C. E. Krehbiel who loaned me material\r\nfrom his private library for this work but did not live to see its\r\ncompletion; to B. Bargen for help in preparing the manuscript for\r\npublication; to Mrs. Beatrice Buller for reading the manuscripts and\r\nproofs of the German chorales; to my wife, Charity Steiner Hostetler,\r\nwho read all the manuscripts and proofs and whose constant interest and\r\nassistance were indispensable; and to others, too numerous to mention,\r\nwho in any way facilitated the completion of the work.\r\n\r\nThe book, written during spare moments of a busy pastorate, is sent\r\nforth with the prayer that, in spite of errors and imperfections, it may\r\ninspire all who use it to sing with greater devotion the praises of Him\r\nwho loved us and redeemed us.\r\n\r\n                                                        Lester Hostetler\r\n\r\n  The Parsonage\r\n  Bethel College Mennonite Church\r\n  North Newton, Kansas\r\n  January 20, 1949\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           EXPLANATORY NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the interest of brevity and to avoid repetition, certain recurring\r\nwords are abbreviated:\r\n\r\n_Hymnary_ is used for _Mennonite Hymnary_.\r\n\r\n_c._ (_circa_) means approximate date.\r\n\r\n_Tr._ is prefixed to the names of all translators.\r\n\r\n_Anon._ (anonymous) means without any name acknowledged, as that of\r\nauthor or composer.\r\n\r\nThe word “Number” has been omitted: thus Hymn 22 means Hymn No. 22.\r\n\r\n_Cf._ means compare. (Latin: confer).\r\n\r\nThe original texts of German hymns found throughout the _Handbook_,\r\nespecially in the section of Chorales, Book IV, are the versions used in\r\none or more of the following works: _Gesangbuch mit Noten_, (Berne,\r\nInd., 1890); _Gesangbuch der Mennoniten_, (Canadian, 1942); _The\r\nHandbook to the Lutheran Hymnal_, (Concordia Pub. House, 1942);\r\n_Gesangbuch zum gottesdienstlichen und häuslichen Gebrauch in\r\nEvangelischen Mennoniten-Gemeinden_, (Konferenz der süddeutschen\r\nMennoniten zu Ludwigshafen a. Rh. 1910); and Knapp, _Evangelischer\r\nLiederschatz_. Many variations occur in the texts as found in these\r\nversions, the explanation of which would require a much greater\r\nknowledge of German hymnody than the author possesses. An effort has\r\nbeen made to bring the spelling into conformity with the modern German\r\npractice of omitting the “h” where it was formerly used with the “th”;\r\nthe use of “ss” instead of “sz”; and printing the initial letter of the\r\npronouns referring to Deity, in lower case rather than with capitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 AN INTRODUCTION TO OUR HYMNS AND TUNES\r\n\r\n\r\n                 With Illustrations From the _Hymnary_\r\n\r\n  1.

Definition of a Hymn.\r\n\r\nSt. Augustine, 354-430, gave a definition of a hymn, which has been\r\nwidely accepted:\r\n\r\n  A hymn is the praise of God by singing. A hymn is a song embodying the\r\n  praise of God. If there is merely praise but not praise of God it is\r\n  not a hymn. If there be praise, and praise of God, but not sung, it is\r\n  not a hymn. For it to be a hymn, it is needful, therefore, for it to\r\n  have three things—praise, praise of God, and these sung.\r\n\r\nA recent definition, accepted by the Hymn Society of America, is that of\r\nthe late Carl F. Price:\r\n\r\n  A Christian hymn is a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally\r\n  conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the\r\n  worshiper’s attitude toward God, or God’s purposes, in human life.\r\n\r\nL. F. Benson, America’s foremost hymnologist, defines a hymn in these\r\nsimple words:\r\n\r\n  The Christian hymn ... is a form of words appropriate to be sung or\r\n  chanted in public devotions.\r\n\r\nA hymn is to be sung _by a congregation_. Its message must be simple,\r\nnot subtle. It must read well and sing well. In modern usage, the hymn\r\nis not limited to the praise of God but includes other moods of worship\r\nsuch as resignation and consecration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  2. The Beginnings of Christian Song.\r\n\r\nHymn singing has always been associated with Christian worship. Jesus\r\nand the Twelve sang a hymn, presumably a portion of the _Hallel_ (Ps.\r\n115-118), after the Supper was ended. Paul and Silas sang hymns, “songs\r\nof the night,” during the midnight hours of their imprisonment in\r\nPhilippi. The great Apostle recognized the value of song when he\r\nexhorted the churches thus:\r\n\r\n  Be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns\r\n  and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the\r\n  Lord. Eph. 5:18, 19.\r\n\r\n  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and\r\n  admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,\r\n  singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. Col. 3:16.\r\n\r\n  I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding\r\n  also. I Cor. 14:15.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish converts who at first composed the church had a rich heritage\r\nof song in the Book of Psalms. This was their hymnbook, used in the\r\nTemple worship and in the home and probably also in the synagogue\r\nservices. The use of the Psalms, carried over from the Jewish service,\r\nforms to this day an important element in Christian worship.\r\n\r\nBesides the Psalms, the early church sang the nativity lyrics that adorn\r\nthe first two chapters of the Gospel of Luke. It also made extensive use\r\nof _Hallelujah_ as a part of the people’s praise, adding, in the course\r\nof time, the _Gloria Patri_, the _Sanctus_, the _Te Deum_, and other\r\ncanticles.\r\n\r\nThe nativity hymns in Luke, five in all, are extensively used in Roman\r\nCatholic and Anglican services.\r\n\r\n  _Ave Maria_ (Hail Mary). 1:28-29, 42-45. The salutation of Gabriel and\r\n  of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n  _Magnificat._ “My soul doth magnify the Lord....” 1:46-55. Hymn of the\r\n  Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\n  _Benedictus._ “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel....” 1:68-79. Song of\r\n  Zacharias.\r\n\r\n  _Nunc Dimittis._ “Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace.”\r\n  2:29-32. Song of Simeon.\r\n\r\n  _Gloria in excelsis._ “Glory to God in the highest....” 2:14. Song of\r\n  the Angels. Used as a part of the Roman mass and often found in\r\n  Protestant hymns, e.g., “Angels we have heard on high” 82.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Beginnings of Christian Song in the Hymnary\r\n\r\n  _Psalms._ Book Five. 575-600.\r\n  _Gloria Patri_ 606-7.\r\n  _Ter Sanctus_ (_Trisagion_) “Holy, holy, holy” 601-2.\r\n  _Te Deum._ “Holy God we praise Thy name” 519. A metrical translation\r\n          of an ancient version.\r\n\r\n\r\n           3. Hymns of the Eastern Church: Greek and Syriac.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Eastern Church developed a rich hymnody, rising steadily in\r\nthe fourth century until it reached its culmination in the eighth and\r\nninth centuries. Since it employed the Greek and Syriac languages, its\r\nhymnic treasures remained almost completely hidden and unknown to the\r\nEnglish speaking churches for many centuries. It is only in recent\r\nyears, through the efforts of scholars like John Mason Neale and Edward\r\nCaswall that some of the Eastern hymns have been translated and made\r\navailable for modern use. Eastern hymns are characterized by an\r\nobjective, dignified, contemplation of God. Except when confessing sin\r\nand unworthiness, they contain nothing of the subjective feelings of the\r\nworshipper such as is found in many modern hymns. Though there is very\r\nlittle in the _Hymnary_ from the Eastern Church, our collection is\r\nenriched by the inclusion of a small number of hymns from this source.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Greek Hymns in the Hymnary\r\n\r\n    Clement of Alexandria, 170-220, “Shepherd of tender youth” (398)\r\n    Candle Lighting Hymn, “O gladsome light” (34)\r\n    Synesius, c. 375-430, “Lord Jesus, think on me” (196)\r\n    St. Germanus, 634-734, “A great and mighty wonder” (526)\r\n    St. John of Damascus, 8th century, “The day of resurrection” (115)\r\n            “Come, ye faithful, raise the strain” (113)\r\n    St. Stephen the Sabaite, 725-94, “Art thou weary, heavy-laden” (143)\r\n    Candle Lighting Hymn, “Darkening night, the land doth” (32)\r\n\r\n\r\n                 4. Hymns of the Western Church: Latin.\r\n\r\nTwo great names are associated with the music of the Western Church:\r\nAmbrose, c. 340-97, known as the “Father of Hymnody in the Western\r\nChurch;” and Gregory the Great, 540-604, the missionary-minded pope, and\r\nreformer of church music.\r\n\r\nAmbrose, Bishop of Milan, not only composed hymns and music but\r\nstimulated others to do the same. Under his leadership there developed a\r\nlarge body of church music based upon four scales, which came to be\r\nknown as Ambrosian Chant. Although widely known as a scholar,\r\ntheologian, and preacher, Ambrose’s most lasting influence was upon the\r\nmusic of the church. None of his hymns are found in our collection.\r\n\r\nGregory the Great, two centuries later, carried forward the work of\r\nAmbrose. He added four more scales or modes to the Ambrosian system,\r\nthus giving to the repertory of church music more definiteness and\r\nvariety. The music that developed during the papacy of Gregory came to\r\nbe known as Gregorian Chant, or plainsong, or plainchant. It is “plain”\r\nbecause unadorned, unharmonized and unmeasured. Its rhythm is the free\r\nrhythm of speech, the beats falling irregularly. The Gregorian Chant\r\nremained the music of the church for a thousand years and forms the\r\nbasis of all Roman Catholic music today. Some of these chants were\r\nadapted by Luther for congregational singing, and set to words in the\r\nvernacular of the people. A few of the tunes, usually in a form scarcely\r\nrecognizable from the original, are used today in Protestant hymnals, as\r\nfor instance, the tune “Hamburg.” Some of the music in the Amish church\r\nservices is traceable to the Gregorian Chant.\r\n\r\nThe singing in the medieval church was liturgical in character and\r\nconfined to the clergy and trained choirs. This was its weakness. The\r\nlaity was not expected to sing, neither were they able to do so.\r\nCongregational singing, so important in our worship today, had for\r\ncenturies been unknown in the Roman Catholic Church. Reform was\r\ninevitable and it came in due time.\r\n\r\nWhile only remnants of the music survive, many hymns from the Western\r\nChurch have been translated from the Latin and a few choice ones have\r\nfound their way into the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Latin Hymns in the Hymnary\r\n\r\n    Prudentius, 348-c. 413, “Bethlehem, of noblest cities” (88)\r\n    Gregory the Great, 540-604, “Father, we praise Thee” (24)\r\n    Anonymous, 6th or 7th century, “Christ is made the sure” (277)\r\n            “Joy dawned again on Easterday” (415)\r\n    Theodulph of Orleans, 9th century, “All glory, laud, and honor”\r\n          (100)\r\n    Bernard of Clairvaux, 1091-1153, “Jesus the very thought” (155)\r\n            “O sacred Head, now wounded” (539)\r\n    Bernard of Cluny, 12th century, “Jerusalem, the golden” (262-3)\r\n    Anonymous, 12th century, “O come, O come, Emmanuel” (67)\r\n    Savonarola, 1452-98 (Italian), “Jesus, Refuge of the weary” (536)\r\n    Anonymous, 17th-18th centuries, “O come, all ye faithful” (80)\r\n            “The year is gone beyond recall” (382)\r\n\r\n\r\n                   5. Hymns of the Bohemian Brethren.\r\n\r\nThe followers of John Hus who came to be known as the Bohemian Brethren,\r\nand later as the Moravians, were the first Protestant group to introduce\r\ncongregational singing into their worship. They also published the first\r\nProtestant hymnbooks, one in 1501 and another in 1505, containing 89 and\r\n400 hymns, respectively, in their native Bohemian tongue. Their efforts\r\nto introduce congregational singing were sternly opposed by the Roman\r\nhierarchy. The Council of Constance condemned Hus to be burned at the\r\nstake and warned his successor, Jacob of Misi, to cease the singing of\r\nhymns in the churches. It decreed:\r\n\r\n  If laymen are forbidden to preach and interpret the Scriptures, much\r\n  more are they forbidden to sing publicly in the churches.\r\n\r\nAs a result of their persecution, the Brethren in 1508 sent out\r\nmessengers to search for true Christian people into whose communion they\r\nmight apply for admission—one to Russia, one to Greece, one to Bulgaria,\r\nand one to Palestine and Egypt. All returned unsuccessful. No such\r\nChristians had been found. They therefore remained in their own country,\r\ngiving themselves assiduously to the translation and printing of the\r\nBible.\r\n\r\nIn 1522 the Brethren sent two messengers to Luther to greet him and ask\r\nhis advice. Luther became interested in them and welcomed their\r\nfellowship. He was impressed with the hymnbook the Brethren had\r\npublished, and later used some of the hymns in his own work.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries later, the Brethren, known now as the Moravians, settled\r\non Count Zinzendorf’s estates in Saxony, spreading rapidly from thence\r\ninto other countries in Europe and to the United States. One of\r\nEngland’s foremost hymn writers and hymnologists, James Montgomery, was\r\nan adherent to their faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Bohemian Brethren and Moravian Hymns in the Hymnary\r\n\r\n    Michael Weisse, 1480-1534, “Christ, the Lord, is ris’n again” (544)\r\n            Tunes: “Mit Freuden Zart” (512), “Ravenshaw” (292)\r\n    von Zinzendorf, Nikolaus L., 1700-60, “Jesus, still lead on” (574)\r\n    von Zinzendorf, Christian R., 1724-62, “Man of sorrows” (537)\r\n    Henriette Luise von Hayn, 1724-82, “I am Jesus’ little lamb” (430)\r\n    James Montgomery, 1771-1854, “Hail to the Lord’s Anointed” (65)\r\n            “Angels from the realms of glory” (81)\r\n            “Go to dark Gethsemane” (107) and many others\r\n\r\n\r\n           6. Hymns of the Reformation: the German Chorales.\r\n\r\nThe movement toward congregational singing, inaugurated by the Bohemian\r\nBrethren, was soon to be merged into the greater Reformation movement.\r\nLuther’s influence on the worship and music of the church was\r\nrevolutionary. For a thousand years the laymen had had no part in church\r\nsong. Congregational singing was unknown. Ambrosian music had at first\r\nbeen introduced for congregational use but it became more and more\r\nliturgical, thrusting the laity into the background. The Gregorian Chant\r\nwhich followed was never intended for use except by the priests and\r\ntrained choirs. The followers of Hus pioneered in congregational\r\nsinging; but it was Luther and his followers who brought it into full\r\nfruition.\r\n\r\nLuther was a born music lover and a musician of adequate training.\r\nMoreover he possessed a remarkable gift for writing hymns in clear\r\nthought to bring the Word of God home to the hearts of the common\r\npeople. He and his followers put songs on the lips of the German people\r\nand they sang themselves into the Reformation. So effective were these\r\nsongs that his enemies in the Roman church declared that “Luther’s songs\r\nhave damned more souls than all his books and speeches.”\r\n\r\n_Chorales._ The word “chorale” (“choral” in German) refers to the hymn\r\ntunes of Lutheran Protestantism, though in common usage the term\r\nincludes the words associated with the tunes. The melodies had much to\r\ndo with the popularity of the songs. They came from various sources.\r\nMany of them were original compositions by Luther and others; some were\r\nborrowed from the hymn books of the Bohemian Brethren; a considerable\r\nnumber were adaptations of plainsongs used in the Catholic Church; still\r\nothers were adopted from beloved folksongs. Luther was an eclectic in\r\nhis choice of music. He used any tune from any source that suited his\r\npurpose. Many thousands of chorales came into existence in Germany\r\nduring his time and the two centuries that followed. The hundreds still\r\nin use represent the best in church music today. They are characterized\r\nby a plain melody, a strong harmony, and a stately rhythm; all of which\r\nadapts them well for effective congregational singing.\r\n\r\nThe chorales at first did not have the regular rhythms that they later\r\ntook on. The steady progression of even notes, invariable in Bach’s day,\r\nhad come only gradually into use. Some of the recent hymnbooks, in the\r\ninterest of greater variety of rhythm, are returning to the original\r\n“rhythmic chorales.”\r\n\r\nThough _unison_ singing has been widely practiced and is advocated today\r\nby some good authorities in church music, Luther encouraged part\r\nsinging. In his first Preface to the _Geystliches Gesangbücklin_, 1525,\r\nhe wrote:\r\n\r\n  These songs have been set in four parts, for no other reason than\r\n  because I wished to provide our young people (who both will and ought\r\n  to be instructed in music and other sciences) with something whereby\r\n  they might rid themselves of amorous and carnal songs, and in their\r\n  stead learn something wholesome, and so apply themselves to what is\r\n  good with pleasure, as becometh the young.\r\n\r\nThe period of the German chorales may be said to have begun with Luther,\r\n1483-1546, and ended two centuries later with J. S. Bach, 1685-1750.\r\nBach brought the chorale tunes to their highest perfection, using many\r\nof them in his larger choral works. He composed about 30 original\r\nchorale melodies, wrote reharmonizations for approximately 400, and\r\ncomposed many chorale preludes for the organ which are in wide use\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nThe German hymns and chorale tunes, used constantly in the home and\r\nschool, as well as in the church, have been of great importance in our\r\nMennonite worship in the past. They constitute the main body of material\r\nin all our German collections of hymns. In an effort to preserve and\r\nemphasize this rich heritage, there was incorporated into the _Hymnary_,\r\na special section, Book III, made up exclusively of chorales.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     German Chorales in the Hymnary\r\n\r\n  16th Century\r\n    Martin Luther, 1483-1546, “A mighty fortress is our God” (549)\r\n            “From heaven above to earth I come” (527)\r\n            “Out of the depths I cry to Thee” (531-2)\r\n    Nicolaus Selnecker, 1532-92, “Now cheer our hearts” (557)\r\n    Philipp Nicolai, 1556-1608, “Wake, awake, for night is flying” (522)\r\n            “How brightly shines the Morning Star” (529)\r\n  17th Century\r\n  (_1_)—_Period of The Thirty Years War—1618-48_\r\n    Johann Heerman, 1585-1647, “Ah, dearest Jesus” (534)\r\n    Josua Stegman, 1588-1632, “Abide with us, our Savior” (559)\r\n    Matthaus von Löwenstern, 1594-1648, “Lord of our life” (278)\r\n    Georg Weissel, 1590-1635, “Lift up your heads” (523)\r\n    Heinrich Albert, 1604-51, “God who madest earth” (573)\r\n    Ernst Homburg, 1605-81, “Christ, the life of all the living” (535)\r\n    Michael Schirmer, 1606-73, “O Holy Spirit, enter in” (546)\r\n    Paul Gerhardt, 1607-76, “O sacred Head, now wounded” (539) and\r\n          others\r\n    Gerhard Tersteegen, 1697-1769, “God reveals His presence” (506)\r\n            “O power of love, all else transcending” (517)\r\n  (_2_)—_Later 17th Century_\r\n    Johann Franck, 1618-77, “Deck thyself, my soul,” (552)\r\n    Tobias Clausnitzer, 1619-84, “Liebster Jesu, wir sind hier” (553a)\r\n    Georg Neumark, 1621-81, “He who would be in God” (571)\r\n    Johann Scheffler, 1624-77, “I am the Lord, O hear my voice” (565)\r\n    Joachim Neander, 1650-80, “Heaven and earth, the sea” (510)\r\n  _18th Century_\r\n    Johann Mentzer, 1658-1734, “O that I had a thousand voices” (509)\r\n    Erdmann Neumeister, 1671-1756, “Sinners Jesus will receive” (466)\r\n    Benjamin Schmolck, 1672-1737, “My Jesus, as Thou wilt” (250)\r\n    Philipp F.

Hymns of the Reformation: The Metrical Psalms.\r\n\r\nWhile the German people, under the leadership of Luther, were singing\r\nchorales set to original religious poems, a large section of\r\nProtestantism, under the influence of John Calvin, confined itself to\r\nthe singing of Psalms. To the French reformer, now preaching at Geneva,\r\nhymns were “man-made,” whereas the psalms were the inspired word of God\r\nand the only proper vehicle for the praise of God. Calvin, unlike\r\nLuther, was not a musician, and at first permitted only unison singing,\r\nunaccompanied. Part singing and instrumental accompaniment seemed to\r\nsavor of the frivolous and worldly, an opinion which Calvin, however,\r\nwas soon to modify. For two hundred years the Calvinistic churches on\r\nthe Continent and in Britain were influenced in their worship song by\r\nthe strict views of Calvin, limiting themselves to the metrical psalms\r\nand scriptural paraphrases. The German people in the meantime produced a\r\nrich treasury of original religious lyrics, contributed by some of their\r\nbest poets.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Psalter Tunes and Metrical Psalms in the Hymnary\r\n\r\n  _Genevan Psalter_ Tunes, 1551.\r\n            O Seigneur (19)\r\n            Old 134th (128, 132, 616)\r\n            Rendez à Dieu (306)\r\n            Old 124th (354)\r\n            Old 100th (594)\r\n  _Scottish Psalter_, 1650.\r\n            Book Five (575 to 600) with a few exceptions\r\n  _New Version_, 1696, Tate and Brady.\r\n            “Through all the changing scenes of life” (583)\r\n            “As pants the hart for cooling streams” (586)\r\n            “O come, loud anthems let us sing” (18)\r\n            “While shepherds watched their flocks by night” (73-4)\r\n\r\n\r\n                           8. Psalm Versions.\r\n\r\nThe use of the psalms in singing, first on the Continent, then in\r\nEngland and Scotland, and later in America, brought forth many metrical\r\nversions of the psalter, the principal ones being the following:\r\n\r\na. _The Genevan Psalter_, begun 1539, published complete in 1562. It was\r\nmade at the request of John Calvin by Clément Marot, court poet of\r\nFrance, and Theodore Beza, a French scholar. It became the psalm book\r\nfor the Reformation churches on the continent, and is spoken of as the\r\nmost famous book of praise the Christian Church ever produced. It was\r\nissued in at least one thousand editions and translated into a number of\r\ntongues. Some of the original tunes are still in use, e.g., “Old\r\nHundredth.”\r\n\r\nb. _The Anglo-Genevan Psalter_, Geneva, 1556. This was used by John\r\nKnox, the Scottish reformer, and his followers who fled the persecutions\r\nof “Bloody Mary,” and formed a congregation at Geneva. The book\r\nincorporated some of the Sternhold and Hopkins versions which were in\r\nuse in England, and added others.\r\n\r\nc. _The Old Version_, Sternhold and Hopkins, completed in 1562. Used in\r\nEngland for 134 years. It is entitled, _The Whole Booke of Psalmes_, but\r\ncame to be known as the “Old Version.”\r\n\r\nd. _The Bay Psalm Book_, Boston, 1640. This was the first book printed\r\nin English-speaking America. It was made to obtain greater literalness\r\nto the Hebrew original than was found in the versions then in use. The\r\nbook reigned supreme among the English churches in New England for over\r\na century. Seventy editions of it were printed in America, the last in\r\n1773. Eighteen editions appeared in England, and twenty-two in Scotland.\r\nThere were no tunes given it until 1698, then only 13, with the air in\r\nthe bass.\r\n\r\ne. _The Scottish Psalter_, completed 1650. Special mention is made of\r\nthis version of the Psalms because it is the source of nearly all the\r\nselections of metrical psalms which constitute Book Five of the\r\n_Hymnary_. The number of versions and editions of psalms which appeared\r\non the Continent and in England were numerous and confusing, each\r\nclaiming its own special merits. Finally, in the interests of better\r\nliterary diction and greater unity in singing in the Scottish\r\nPresbyterian churches, the General Assembly authorized a new version.\r\nThe result, after many years’ work, was the famous _Scottish Psalter_ of\r\n1650 which remains the standard work in Scotland today.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain “dignified crudeness” in some of the literary\r\nexpressions but the psalms have long been learned in this version and\r\nhave become an important part of the religious training and experience\r\nof millions of English speaking people, especially in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish Psalter first appeared with words only. There were no notes\r\nand no suggestions for melodies. The succeeding one hundred years were a\r\ntime of confusion. The tunes used were few in number, such as the\r\nleaders had learned from various sources, and passed on to succeeding\r\ngenerations by rote. The time came when better singing and better tunes\r\nwere demanded and gradually the psalter appeared with tunes. Early tune\r\nversions put the melody invariably in the tenor. The latest edition,\r\nprinted in 1929, by the Oxford Press, contains the best Psalm tunes\r\nwhich had gradually come into use, many of them arranged with\r\n“Faux-bourdon” (wherein the congregation sings one or more verses to the\r\nmelody while the choir supplies the harmony), and “Descant” (a second\r\nmelody over that of the tune).\r\n\r\nf. _The New Version_, Tate and Brady, London, 1696. This version\r\ngradually supplanted the _Old Version_ of Sternhold and Hopkins, and\r\nheld its place in the worship of the church for 150 years. It was\r\nadopted, in 1789, by the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United\r\nStates and bound with the prayer book of that Communion.\r\n\r\nThe above versions are only a few of the large number of psalters that\r\nwere published by the Calvinistic churches on the Continent, in Great\r\nBritain, and in America. The metrical psalms were designed for the\r\nsinging church. They were intended to restore song to the people in\r\ntheir worship, serving in this respect a similar purpose to the chorales\r\nin Germany.\r\n\r\nSome of the psalm books were published without music, some with the\r\nmelody only, and others in four-part harmony. The statement is\r\nfrequently made that Calvinistic Protestantism approved only unison\r\nsinging. The appearance of numerous books, complete with four voice\r\nparts, points to the contrary. It is true that Calvin at first\r\nencouraged unison singing only, regarding harmony more in the nature of\r\namusement than the worship of God; but upon observing the effectiveness\r\nof singing in Germany, he soon changed his views and became more liberal\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          9. English Hymnody.\r\n\r\nThe youthful, courageous Isaac Watts, 1674-1748, an ardent dissenter,\r\npioneered the movement which resulted in a flood of hymns and hymnbooks\r\nin the English churches. Watts was not satisfied with the psalm singing\r\nof his time, which by now had become formal and lifeless. Parts of the\r\npsalter, he pointed out, were obviously not written in the spirit of the\r\nGospel. “By keeping too close to David,” he wrote in one of his\r\nPrefaces, “the vail of Moses is thrown over our hearts.” Watts removed\r\nthat “vail,” Christianizing the psalms and composing during his lifetime\r\nmore than 600 original hymns, expressing in the language of the time,\r\nthe thoughts of the worshippers. Through his influence, his age, the\r\n18th century, became the first age of hymn singing in England.\r\n\r\nJohn and Charles Wesley, following Watts, made enormous use of hymn\r\nsinging in their evangelistic work, giving the movement for\r\ncongregational singing a powerful impetus. Charles is said to have\r\ncomposed over 6,000 hymns.\r\n\r\nFrom the Wesleys onward through the 19th century, the hymn writers in\r\nEngland became numerous. The restrictive shackles of psalm singing had\r\nbeen broken and the creative urge to worship in new forms resulted in a\r\nvast number of original religious lyrics and the publication of hundreds\r\nof hymnbooks. The development can be summarized here only in outline\r\nform.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     English Hymnody in the Hymnary\r\n\r\n  Early—17th Century\r\n    Henry Wotton, 1568-1639, “How happy is he” (208)\r\n    George Herbert, 1593-1633, “Teach me, my God and King” (226)\r\n    John Milton, 1608-74, “Let us with a gladsome mind” (64)\r\n            “How lovely are Thy dwellings fair” (592)\r\n    Thomas Ken, 1637-1711, “Awake, my soul, and with the sun” (25)\r\n            “All praise to Thee, my God, this night” (33)\r\n            “Praise God, from whom all blessings flow” (618)\r\n    Joseph Addison, 1672-1719, “The spacious firmament on high” (50)\r\n            “How are Thy servants blest” (338)\r\n  18th Century\r\n  _1.

American Hymns.\r\n\r\nThe English speaking colonists who settled in America during the 17th\r\ncentury continued the psalm singing traditions of their forebears in\r\nEngland. The practice prevailed in their churches for two hundred years.\r\nThe first book printed by them was the _Bay Psalm Book_, in 1640, at\r\nCambridge, Massachusetts. It contained no original hymns. The singing of\r\npsalms, and later of hymns borrowed from England made up nearly the\r\nentire repertory of church music until the middle of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the German speaking colonists, including the\r\nMennonites, had brought with them the hymn books of the Lutheran\r\ntradition and continued the use of the German chorales in their worship.\r\nThe two streams of hymnody, English psalms and German chorales, went\r\ntheir independent courses for two centuries, scarcely influencing each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime there was very little original hymnody produced in\r\nAmerica, with the exception of the work of the Wesleys during their\r\nbrief experiment in Georgia, and the composition of certain hymns and\r\ntunes by the German people of Pennsylvania, which have remained, until\r\nrecently, in manuscript form. Timothy Dwight’s hymn on the church, “I\r\nlove Thy Kingdom, Lord” (275) is probably the earliest American hymn\r\nstill in use.\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of the 19th century the number of hymn writers became\r\nlarge and their works came into increasing use, some choice examples\r\nfinding their way into English hymnbooks. America’s original\r\ncontribution to Christian hymnody has not been only the Gospel Songs\r\nrepresented by the writings of Fanny Crosby, but the more permanent\r\nworks of Whittier, George W. Doane, Hosmer, Samuel Longfellow,\r\nWashington Gladden, S. F. Smith, and many others. Our musical\r\ncontributions have been less conspicuous, but the tunes of Mason are\r\ncoming into their own again and many of them will doubtless survive for\r\na long time, as will also those of Bradbury, Hastings, and others.\r\n\r\nThe tendency today in American hymnbooks is to unite the best in English\r\nand German traditions. The _Hymnary_ illustrates this trend. It makes\r\nlarge use of the English hymns while at the same time preserving a\r\nconsiderable body of the German chorales. In keeping with this trend,\r\nthe recent hymnbooks of the Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist and other\r\nchurches of English origin, incorporate some of the German chorale tunes\r\nand in some cases the translations of the words. The hymn books of our\r\ntime have become the channels through which flow the rich contributions\r\nto the stream of Christian hymnody from Christian people of all times\r\nand places.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     American Hymns in the Hymnary\r\n\r\n  Early American\r\n    Timothy Dwight, 1752-1817, “I love Thy kingdom, Lord” (275)\r\n    Thomas Hastings, 1784-1872, “Hail to the brightness” (332)\r\n    Henry Ware, Jr., 1794-1843, “Happy the home when God” (361)\r\n    Wm.

Gospel Songs.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the 19th century there came into use, both in\r\nthe United States and in England, a type of religious song known as the\r\nGospel Song. Less dignified than the chorales or the English hymns,\r\nthese songs made a popular appeal and were widely used in prayer\r\nmeetings and revivals.\r\n\r\nThe words of the typical Gospel Song are usually simple and easily\r\nremembered and concern themselves largely with the individual’s\r\nsalvation. The personal pronouns “I” and “my” predominate. The tunes are\r\nrhythmic and catchy and always have a refrain added. Their harmonies are\r\nlargely built on the simple tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords. The\r\nmasses of the people readily learned to sing these tunes and experienced\r\na thrill in singing them which the use of the more stately and solid\r\nhymns failed to effect.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of these songs were produced in America during the latter\r\nhalf of the 19th century and were found extremely useful in large mass\r\nmeetings. The evangelistic work of Moody and Sankey during the 1870’s,\r\n1880’s, and 1890’s brought the Gospel Songs into special prominence and\r\nthe Salvation Army has made them known in nearly every country in the\r\nworld. Collections of Gospel Songs sold by the millions of copies and\r\nevery denomination was affected, to a greater or lesser extent, by this\r\ntype of singing.\r\n\r\nSince the standard of music and words in the Gospel Songs is\r\nconsiderably below that which prevails in our best hymnals as well as in\r\nsecular music and literature taught in the public schools, churches\r\nshould seriously consider the ultimate effect of their too frequent use.\r\nIt is a fallacy to assert that the people will respond to nothing\r\nbetter. Gospel Songs have a legitimate place, particularly in special\r\nservices and revivals, but they leave much to be desired in the total\r\nwork and worship of the church. Neither the music nor the words possess\r\nthe strength and dignity entirely adequate for the worshipful praise of\r\nthe Eternal.\r\n\r\nThe principal names associated with Gospel Songs are the following:\r\n\r\n_Authors._ Fanny J. Crosby, Philip P. Bliss, Robert Lowry, Katherine\r\nHankey, E. A. Hoffman, and many others. Most of the words, though not\r\nall, were written by Americans during the latter part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Miss Crosby was by far the most prolific of them all and many\r\nof her works are found in all modern hymnals of denominations that use\r\nthis type of music. In Germany, Ernst Gebhardt became the leader of the\r\ngospel song movement, composing words and music, publishing numerous\r\nsong books, and serving as song leader in great revival meetings.\r\n\r\n_Music._ William B. Bradbury, Robert Lowry, W. H. Doane, Philip Philips,\r\nJames McGranahan, George C. Stebbins, P. P. Bliss, D. W. Towner, Wm. J.\r\nKirkpatrick, and others.\r\n\r\n_Song Leaders._ P. P. Bliss, Ira Sankey, James McGranahan, George C.\r\nStebbins, Charles Alexander, Homer Rodeheaver.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that there is no absolute line of demarcation between\r\nhymns and some of the Gospel Songs. Some of the numbers in the Gospel\r\nSongs section of the _Hymnary_ might well be classified as hymns, e.g.,\r\nNos. 441, 444, 447, 458, 463, 468, 470, 471, 472, and 492. Either words\r\nor music meet the generally accepted standards of a hymn.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        12. Women Hymn Writers.\r\n\r\nThere have been no outstanding women composers of church tunes but some\r\nof our finest lyrics have been contributed by women, as the following\r\nlist from the _Hymnary_ will show:\r\n\r\n  _German_\r\n    Katharina von Schlegel, b. 1697, “Be still, my soul” (54)\r\n    Henriette Luise von Hayn, 1724-82, “Weil ich Jesu” (430)\r\n  _English_\r\n    Anne Steele, 1716-78, “Father, whate’er of earthly bliss” (251)\r\n    Marianne Nunn, 1778-1847, “One is kind above all others” (447)\r\n    Harriet Auber, 1773-1862, “Our blest Redeemer” (138)\r\n    Dorothy Ann Thrupp, 1779-1847, “Saviour, like a shepherd” (395)\r\n    Charlotte Elliott, 1789-1871, “Just as I am, without one plea” (458)\r\n    Margaret Mackay, 1802-87, “Asleep in Jesus” (314)\r\n    Sarah Flower Adams, 1805-48, “Nearer my God, to Thee” (202)\r\n    Jemima Luke, 1813-1906, “I think when I read that sweet” (427)\r\n    Anne Brontë, 1820-49, “Believe not those who say” (210)\r\n    Cecil Frances Alexander, 1823-95, “There is a green hill” (104)\r\n    Adelaide Proctor, 1825-64, “My God, I thank Thee” (177)\r\n    Elizabeth Clephane, 1830-69, “Beneath the Cross of Jesus” (112)\r\n    Anna L.

Mennonite Hymnody.\r\n\r\nMennonites have made many contributions to society through their\r\nreligious life and practices, but we have produced no important hymnody\r\nof our own. Throughout the four hundred years of our existence as a\r\nchurch, we have been a singing people, in times of persecution as well\r\nas in times of peace. Great emphasis has always been laid upon the\r\nimportance of congregational singing in our worship services. Since the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century the Mennonites of various branches, in\r\nAmerica alone, have published over fifty hymnbooks. But an examination\r\nof these hymnbooks shows that we are heavily indebted to others. Instead\r\nof producing original hymns and tunes, we have borrowed, with minor\r\nexceptions, our entire repertory from other denominations. The wealth of\r\nverse and music produced by German and English writers throughout the\r\ncenturies has been found to serve our needs adequately and well.\r\n\r\nThe churches in Europe used hymnbooks compiled from Lutheran and\r\nReformed sources. Upon coming to the United States and Canada, they\r\ngradually adopted English and American hymns and in some sections of the\r\nchurch, the Gospel Songs came into wide use.\r\n\r\nOur German collections of hymns have, until recently, been uniformly on\r\na higher level, both as to music and poetry, than the collections used\r\nafter the change was made to the English language. During the transition\r\nfrom the German to the English language, many churches, in their choice\r\nof their hymnbooks, sacrificed the fine chorales which had been a part\r\nof their religious heritage. This was due partly to the revivalistic\r\ninfluences of the times and partly to the fact that there were no good\r\ntranslations available of the German hymns which earlier were in use.\r\nThe situation is gradually correcting itself. We are re-evaluating our\r\nhymnody, sifting the wheat from the chaff, and bringing back into our\r\nworship the rich treasure of song which had been used in the past. The\r\n_Mennonite Hymnary_ is an effort in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n             14. The Antecedents of the Mennonite Hymnary.\r\n\r\nThe story of the hymn books antedating the _Hymnary_ may be briefly\r\nsummarized by listing the following books:\r\n\r\n  1565. The first German Mennonite hymn book was published in 1565 or\r\n    1566 (date omitted from title), entitled, _Ein schön Gesangbüchlein\r\n    Geistlicher Lieder, zusammengetragen aus dem A. und N. Testament\r\n    durch fromme Christen und Liebhaber Gottes, welcher hiefür etliche\r\n    getrucht sei gewesen, aber noch viel dazu gethan, welche nie im\r\n    Truck aussgangen seindt, in welchen auch ein recht Leben und\r\n    Fundament dez rechten Christlichen Glaubens gelehrt wirdt. Coloss.\r\n    3._\r\n\r\n    A second edition, 1570-1583, (date not given), adds to the above\r\n    title the following:\r\n\r\n    _Jetzo von neuem widerum übersehn, an vielen Orten gebessert und mit\r\n    etlichen newen Liedern vermehret. Coloss. 3._\r\n\r\n    Of the 133 hymns in the book, 9 had been in use among other\r\n    churches. Many of the others were by Mennonite authors, among them\r\n    Johann Schütz, Thomas Ducker, Gerhard Siebenakker von Sittart, and\r\n    Heinrich Krenen von Breidtbock. Many of the hymns are of a\r\n    controversial nature and have no literary value; for example, this\r\n    on infant baptism:\r\n\r\n  Die Schrift sagt nicht von Kindertaufe\r\n  Davon hab ich nicht gelesen.\r\n  Wer nach Gottes Wort getauft soll sein\r\n  Der musz gläubig wesen.\r\n\r\n  Es ist ein Bad der Wiedergeburt,\r\n  Ein Bund eines guten Gewissens\r\n  Ein’ Verneurung des heiliges Geistes\r\n  Davon keine Kinder wissen.\r\n\r\n    Most of the hymns were set to secular melodies popular at the time.\r\n    Very little of this first hymnal survives.\r\n\r\n  1570—_Ausbund, Das ist: Etliche schöne Christliche Lieder, wie sie in\r\n    dem Gefängnis zu Passau in dem Schlosz von den Schweizer-Brüdern und\r\n    von andern rechtglaubigen Christen hin und her gedichtet worden._\r\n\r\n    At least twelve editions have been printed in Europe, the last one\r\n    in Basel, 1838. Its use was confined to the South Germans and Swiss\r\n    Mennonites. Reprinted in America and still in use by the Amish, the\r\n    _Ausbund_ has the distinction of being the oldest hymn book\r\n    officially in use by any church in America.\r\n\r\n  1780—_Geistreiches Gesangbuch zur öffentlichen und besonderen Erbauung\r\n    der Mennonitischen Gemeinde in und vor der Stadt Danzig._\r\n\r\n    The book has had long use in Danzig. A revised edition appeared in\r\n    1908.\r\n\r\n  1803—_Das Kleine Geistliche Harfe der Kinder Zions._ Germantown, Pa.\r\n    The first Mennonite hymnbook printed in America. It was the official\r\n    hymnbook of the Franconia Conference of Mennonites of which John H.\r\n    Oberholzer, founder of the General Conference of Mennonites, was a\r\n    member. Seven editions were printed, the last in Elkhart, Ind.,\r\n    1904.\r\n\r\n  1804—_Unpartheyisches Gesangbuch_, Lancaster, Pa. The official\r\n    hymnbook of the Lancaster Mennonite Conference for almost a century.\r\n    Fourteen reprints were made, the last in 1923 for the Amish.\r\n\r\n  1843—_Gesangbuch in welchem eine Sammlung geistreiche Lieder\r\n    befindlich._ 9th ed. Elbing. The hymnbook of the Prussian\r\n    Mennonites. It was taken by the Prussians to Russia where it was\r\n    republished in Odessa, 1844.\r\n\r\n  1856—_Gesangbuch zum Gottesdienstlichen und haeuslichen Gebrauch in\r\n    Evangelischen Mennoniten Gemeinden._ Worms.\r\n\r\n    Published by the churches of Baden and the Palatinate. The hymnal\r\n    committee was fortunate in securing the assistance of the eminent\r\n    German hymnologist, Albert Knapp. The book contains 600 hymns and an\r\n    appendix of prayers. A book of melodies was also provided. This\r\n    collection holds an important place in Mennonite hymnody. It was\r\n    reprinted in Danzig, 1873, for use by the Danzig Mennonites, and in\r\n    Philadelphia, 1873, for use in the General Conference of Mennonites.\r\n    The excellent qualities of the more recent _Gesangbuch mit Noten_\r\n    may be traced, in considerable measure, to this work.\r\n\r\n  1869—_Gesangbuch in Mennoniten Gemeinden für Kirche und Haus._\r\n    Published for the churches of West Prussia, this work went through\r\n    at least four editions, the fourth in 1901. The book was republished\r\n    in Danzig, 1873.\r\n\r\n  1873—_Gesangbuch zum Gottesdienstlichen und häuslichen Gebrauch in\r\n    Mennoniten Gemeinden._ Philadelphia. Ordered by the sixth General\r\n    Conference of Mennonites held at Wadsworth, Ohio. The main body of\r\n    the book is the same as that published in Worms, 1856, but with the\r\n    appendix of prayers omitted, and an appendix of 22 hymns added, the\r\n    latter the contribution of the Mennonites in Pennsylvania. The book\r\n    was intended to form a closer bond of union between the Mennonites\r\n    in the East and those west of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n  1890—_Gesangbuch mit Noten. Herausgegeben von der allgemeinen\r\n    Conferenz der Mennoniten von Nord America._ Berne, Ind. The book\r\n    passed through 15 editions, the last in 1936. A noteworthy\r\n    collection of hymns and tunes that met with wide approval in the\r\n    General Conference churches.\r\n\r\n  1894—_Mennonite Hymnal, A Blending of Many Voices._ Berne, Ind. An A.\r\n    S. Barnes publication adopted, practically unchanged, by the General\r\n    Conference of Mennonites. Our first official English hymnal, though\r\n    many collections from other sources were finding wide use in our\r\n    churches. The book has nothing of distinctiveness or distinction.\r\n\r\n  1927—_The Mennonite Hymn Book._ Berne, Ind. Published by the General\r\n    Conference of Mennonites. Compiled and edited by a committee\r\n    appointed by the Conference. The book was more satisfactory than the\r\n    _Mennonite Hymnal_ of 1894, but never became very popular. Total\r\n    sales of three editions were less than 5,000 copies.\r\n\r\n  1940—_The Mennonite Hymnary._ Published by the General Conference of\r\n    Mennonites of North America, Board of Publication, Mennonite\r\n    Publication Office, Newton, Kansas, 1940. Now in its sixth edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      15. The Translation of Hymns.\r\n\r\nA word may be in order concerning the translation of hymns. It is\r\ndifficult to transfer the color and feeling of one language to another.\r\nFor this reason many people who know the German hymns by heart have a\r\nsense of disappointment when they read them in an English version. In\r\nsome instances a translation is inferior to the original but this is not\r\nnecessarily the case. It is well to remember that nearly all of us read\r\nthe Bible only in a translation, yet never doubt the literary quality of\r\nthe English King James Version or the German Version of Luther. The\r\nhymn, “Ich weiss einen Strom,” is superior as poetry, and in its\r\nreligious feeling, to the English original, “O have you not heard of\r\nthat beautiful stream,” though the former is a translation of the\r\nlatter. The reason is that Gebhardt, the translator, was a poet in his\r\nown right. Good translations are possible if the translator has poetic\r\nability of a high order, and if he translates into his native tongue.\r\nCatherine Winkworth was the foremost translator of German hymns into\r\nEnglish and Ernst Gebhardt performed a similar role in translating\r\nEnglish and American hymns into German. Had either tried to do the work\r\nof the other, the results would in all probability have lacked true\r\ncolor and correct idiomatic and poetic expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   16. Church Unity in the Hymnbook.\r\n\r\nThe unity of the Christian Church is expressed nowhere more eloquently\r\nthan in the hymns we sing. Every modern hymnal, regardless of the\r\ndenominational interest it represents, reaches across the ages to gather\r\nits treasures from sources new and old; it knows nothing of the external\r\nbarriers which divide Christians into denominations, but makes use of\r\nthe hymns of widely divergent Christian groups. The _Mennonite Hymnary_\r\nis no exception. Here are found hymns from the early church, East and\r\nWest, translated from the Greek and Latin fathers. Others, like\r\nSavonarola’s hymn, come from the Middle Ages. Many are chorales from the\r\nland of Luther, or metrical psalms from the Calvinistic reformers. A\r\nsubstantial body of our hymnody stems from the Anglican Church, while\r\nsome of our best hymns are from sturdy independents like Watts and\r\nDoddridge, and still others breathe the evangelistic fervor of Wesley,\r\nCowper, and Newton. The Quakers too have made their contribution as well\r\nas certain Roman Catholics and Unitarians. In no aspect of our church\r\nlife do we attain so nearly to ecumenicity as in our worship in song.\r\nChristians may differ widely in their religious views but they are able\r\nto unite as one body in singing their songs of praise.\r\n\r\nThe following classification of hymns by denominations is far from\r\nexhaustive.

Hymn Meters.\r\n\r\nMeter (English, _Metre_) refers to the rhythmic element in poetry:\r\n\r\n  a. the number of lines in a stanza.\r\n  b. the number of syllables in a line.\r\n  c. the arrangement of accented and unaccented syllables.\r\n\r\nThe figures attached to the tune names in the _Hymnary_ indicate the\r\nnumber of lines in a stanza and the number of syllables in a line, e.\r\ng., 8.7.8.7. means that the hymn has four lines in each stanza, the\r\nfirst line being made up of 8 syllables, the second of 7 syllables, the\r\nthird of 8 syllables, and the last of 7 syllables. The figures are\r\nplaced there to facilitate the fitting of tunes to hymns, a\r\nresponsibility which is left now-a-days largely to hymnbook editors.\r\n\r\nA given tune may be used with any variety of hymns provided the latter\r\nhave the same meter as the tune. Likewise a given hymn may be sung to\r\nany tune that fits its meter, e.g., “Come, Thou Almighty King,” set to\r\nthe tune, “Italian Hymn,” as both have the meter pattern 6.6.4.6.6.6.4.\r\nThis is also the meter of “My country ’tis of thee” set to “America.”\r\nHence the words and tunes of these hymns may be interchanged. As a\r\nmatter of fact, “Come Thou Almighty King” was originally used with the\r\ntune “America.” The practice of using alternate tunes is less common now\r\nthan formerly and must be done with care for while the meters may be\r\nsuited, the words and tune may be incompatible otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Meter Names\r\n\r\nA few meters have specific names. These, with their abbreviations are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_Short Meter_ (S.M.) 6.6.8.6, e.g.\r\n\r\n  Blest be the tie that binds                         (6)\r\n     Our hearts in Christian love:                    (6)\r\n  The fellowship of kindred minds                     (8)\r\n     Is like to that above.                           (6)\r\n\r\n_Short Meter Double_ (S.M.D.) is used for a tune in which the quatrain\r\nis repeated, e.g. “Terra Beata” (48), set to the words “This is my\r\nFather’s world.”\r\n\r\n_Common Meter_ (C.M.), also called Ballad Meter, consists of four lines\r\nof 8.6.8.6. syllables, e.g.\r\n\r\n  In Christ there is no East or West                  (8)\r\n     In Him no South or North;                        (6)\r\n  But one great fellowship of love                    (8)\r\n     Throughout the whole wide earth.                 (6)\r\n\r\nNearly all the metrical psalms appeared in this meter.\r\n\r\n_Common Meter Double_ (C.M.D.) is employed when two Common Meter\r\nquatrains are used to form one stanza, e.g.,\r\n\r\n                “It came upon a midnight clear.”    (75)\r\n\r\n_Long Meter_ (L.M.) consists of a four line stanza in which each line is\r\nof eight syllables, e.g.,\r\n\r\n  Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;           (8)\r\n  Praise Him, all creatures here below;               (8)\r\n  Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;                 (8)\r\n  Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.                 (8)\r\n\r\n_Long Meter Double_ (L.M.D.), not often used, consists of a stanza of\r\neight lines, each line of eight syllables, e.g.,\r\n\r\n               “The spacious firmament on high.”    (50)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Accentuation\r\n\r\nIn setting a hymn to music it is important that the accented syllables\r\nof the poetry fall on the accented beats of the musical bars. Try\r\nsinging “Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling” (456) to the tune “Ich\r\nweiss einen Strom” (232). The meter is the same in each\r\ncase—11.7.11.7.—with refrain—but the words and tune are obviously not\r\nsuited to each other because of differences in accentuation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            18. Hymn Tunes.\r\n\r\n  a. What is a good tune?\r\n  b. Importance of tunes.\r\n  c. Composers of tunes.\r\n  d. Sources of tunes.\r\n  e. Tune names.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        a. What is a good tune?\r\n\r\nThe quality of a tune must be judged by its definite and restricted use.\r\nIt is to be sung by a congregation of people, the majority of whom have\r\nhad only limited musical training, and without benefit of rehearsal. The\r\ntune must therefore be judged by such questions as these: Is it\r\nsingable? Are the parts within easy pitch range of the voices? Is it\r\nfree from difficult intervals or modulations into other keys? Is it\r\ninteresting? Does it create a worshipful atmosphere? Does the mood of\r\nthe tune fit the mood and thought of the words?\r\n\r\n\r\n                      b. The importance of tunes.\r\n\r\nThe tune is of great importance to the success of the hymn. Our “best\r\nhymns” owe their popularity in many instances, to the tune with which\r\nthey are associated. On the other hand many excellent hymns remain\r\nunused because the tunes given them are too difficult or too\r\nuninteresting. It is the tune that creates the mood of worship and\r\ncharges the words with emotion so that their message is carried forth\r\nwith feeling and power.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         c. Composers of tunes.\r\n\r\nThe story of the development of the hymn tune begins with the worship\r\nsong in the Temple at Jerusalem where the psalms were sung antiphonally\r\nby priests and people accompanied by harps and trumpets. Little is known\r\nof these tunes or their composers. This early Christian music would\r\ndoubtless sound strange to modern ears.\r\n\r\nThe important names in the roll of church musicians, from the early\r\ncenturies to the present time, include the following:\r\n\r\n  _Italian_—Ambrose, 4th century\r\n      Gregory the Great, 6th century\r\n      Palestrina, 1525-94\r\n  _French_—Louis Bourgeois, c. 1510-?\r\n  _German_—Luther, 1483-1546; Nicolai, 1556-1608; Hassler, 1564-1612;\r\n          Praetorius, 1571-1621; Crüger, 1598-1662; Bach, 1685-1750.\r\n  _English_—Tallis, 1510-85; Gibbons, 1583-1625; Croft, 1678-1727;\r\n          Gauntlett, 1805-76; Monk, 1823-99; Dykes, 1823-76; S. Wesley,\r\n          1810-76; Barnby, 1838-96; Stainer, 1840-1901; Sullivan,\r\n          1842-1900.\r\n  _American_—L. Mason, 1792-1872; Bradbury, 1816-68; Hastings,\r\n          1784-1872; Stebbins, 1846-1945.\r\n\r\nThe great composers, besides Bach, whose names are found in church\r\nhymnals are: Haydn, Beethoven, Handel, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Gounod, and\r\nSibelius.\r\n\r\nThe above is only a partial list of composers of good church music.\r\nAmong their works is a corpus of fine hymn tunes far greater than has\r\nbeen utilized by the church so far. For years to come, compilers of hymn\r\nbooks will have a vast reservoir of excellent tunes, old yet new, to\r\ndraw from.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          d. Sources of tunes.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the origin of church tunes shows a variety of sources.\r\nMany tunes were especially written for the words to which they are set;\r\nothers are adaptations from early medieval chants; still others, as for\r\nexample, the “Passion Chorale” and “Londonderry Air”, were folk tunes\r\noriginally used with secular words. Some of our best tunes are\r\nadaptations of melodies from larger musical works, as for example, “Hymn\r\nto Joy” (10) from Beethoven’s _Ninth Symphony_; “Finlandia” (54), from a\r\ntone poem by Sibelius; and “Seymour” (36), from Weber’s opera, _Oberon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             e. Tune names.\r\n\r\nComposers usually name their tunes in order to facilitate their\r\nidentification. The names given them are selected quite arbitrarily. W.\r\nH. Havergal, prolific composer of church music, named his tunes after\r\nthe rivers, mountains, valleys, etc., of Palestine, e.g. “Abana,”\r\n“Ahava,” “Ararat,” “Baca,” etc. Other tunes have been named for the\r\ncomposer, e.g., “Bradbury” (395); the name of a friend, e.g.,\r\n“Rockingham” (105); name of a city or village, e.g., “Boylston” (214); a\r\nstreet, “Federal Street” (192); a cottage, “Hollingside” (159); an event\r\nin history, “Nicaea” (1); or the central idea in the words, “Pilot”\r\n(161).\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the usual practice has been to name the tune after the first\r\nline of the hymn to which it was originally set.\r\n\r\nSome tunes, unfortunately, are known by more than one name, e.g., “St.\r\nMichel’s” (93) and “Jerusalem, Jerusalem” (125). In a few cases the same\r\nname is given to several tunes, e.g., “Wesley” (309 and 332). This is\r\nconfusing and it is highly desirable that hymnbook editors strive toward\r\nuniformity of nomenclature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  19. John Wesley’s Rules for Singing.\r\n\r\nIn one of John Wesley’s compilations of tunes, _Sacred Melody_, the\r\ngreat preacher and founder of Methodism gives the following rules for\r\nsinging. Some of the expressions used may provoke a smile but, as\r\nLightwood suggests, “it would be a very good thing if these were read\r\naloud from time to time in all churches and chapels where good\r\ncongregational singing is aimed at.”\r\n\r\n  a. Learn these tunes before you learn any others; afterwards learn as\r\n  many as you please.\r\n\r\n  b. Sing them exactly as they are printed here, without altering or\r\n  mending them at all; and if you have learned to sing them otherwise,\r\n  unlearn it as soon as you can.\r\n\r\n  c. Sing ALL. See that you join with the congregation as frequently as\r\n  you can. Let not a slight degree of weakness or weariness hinder you.\r\n  If it is a cross to you, take it up, and you will find it a blessing.\r\n\r\n  d. Sing lustily and with a good courage. Beware of singing as if you\r\n  were half dead, or half asleep; but lift up your voice with strength.\r\n  Be no more afraid of your voice now, nor more ashamed of its being\r\n  heard, than when you sang the songs of Satan.\r\n\r\n  e. Sing modestly. Do not bawl, so as to be heard above or distinct\r\n  from the rest of the congregation, that you may not destroy the\r\n  harmony; but strive to unite your voices together, so as to make one\r\n  clear melodious sound.\r\n\r\n  f. Sing in tune. Whatever time is sung be sure to keep with it. Do not\r\n  run before nor stay behind it; but attend close to the leading voices,\r\n  and move therewith exactly as you can; and take care not to sing too\r\n  low. This drawling way naturally steals on all who are lazy: and it is\r\n  high time to drive it out from among us, and sing all our tunes just\r\n  as quick as we did at first.\r\n\r\n  g. Above all sing spiritually. Have an eye to God in every word you\r\n  sing. Aim at pleasing Him more than yourself, or any other creature.\r\n  In order to do this attend strictly to the sense of what you sing, and\r\n  see that your heart is not carried away with the sound, but offered to\r\n  God continually; so shall our singing be such as the Lord will approve\r\n  of here, and regard you when He cometh in the clouds of Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BOOK I\r\n                      Hymns for Worship and Praise\r\n\r\n\r\n                      WORSHIP—PRAISE AND ADORATION\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Holy, holy, holy                          _Reginald Heber_, 1783-1826\r\n\r\nA metrical paraphrase of Revelation 4:8-11. The hymn was written for use\r\non Trinity Sunday of the Church Year but has found a wide general use as\r\na morning hymn. It ranks high in any list of “best hymns.” Some give it\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\nThe author, Reginald Heber, was educated at Oxford, England, for the\r\nAnglican ministry. For sixteen years he served as rector at Hodnet,\r\nShropshire, where most of his hymns were written. He became an eminent\r\nchurchman, as well as hymn writer, and was made bishop of Calcutta in\r\n1822. After four years, his life came to an end suddenly at the close of\r\na day in which he had baptized forty-two native converts. He is the\r\nauthor of the popular missionary hymn, “From Greenland’s icy mountains”\r\n(333).\r\n\r\n“Holy, holy, holy,” was one of Alfred Tennyson’s favorite hymns, and it\r\nwas sung at his funeral service in Westminster Abbey, April 12, 1892.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune, NICAEA, was composed for this hymn and was so named\r\nbecause the text deals with the doctrine of the Trinity as expounded in\r\nthe Council of Nicaea which met in the city of Nicaea in Asia Minor, 325\r\nA.D., the first ecumenical council of the Christian Church. It convened\r\nat the call of the Emperor, Constantine, to settle the so-called “Arian\r\ncontroversy” concerning the nature of Christ. Arius, a presbyter of\r\nAlexandria, taught that Christ was neither divine nor human, but\r\nsuperangelic. After sitting from May 20 to August 25, to hear all sides\r\nof the heated debate, the council decided in favor of Athanasius, a\r\ndeacon of Alexandria and chief opponent of Arius. The result was\r\nincorporated in the Nicene creed which declares that Christ is “the same\r\nsubstance with the Father.” Our hymn asserts the same doctrine: “God in\r\nThree Persons, blessed Trinity.”\r\n\r\nJ. B. Dykes, 1823-76, composer of the tune, was born in Hull, England,\r\nthe son of a banker. He was educated at Cambridge for the ministry but\r\nhad also received a thorough training in music and became one of\r\nEngland’s leading hymn-tune writers. For a score of years he was vicar\r\nof the Anglican church, St. Oswald’s, in the city of Durham. He\r\npublished sermons and other writings but is best known for his 300 hymn\r\ntunes, many of which are still in wide use. One of his most popular\r\ntunes is “Lux Benigna” which is always associated with John Henry\r\nNewman’s hymn, “Lead kindly light” (162).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. God is in His holy temple                                 _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nBased on Hab. 2:20: “The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth\r\nkeep silence before him.” The hymn, whose authorship is anonymous, is a\r\ncall to silence and reverence as the worshipper bows in the presence of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The origin of the popular and useful tune, AUTUMN, has been in\r\ndispute. Some books refer to it as a Spanish melody, and others have\r\nseen in the tune a reminiscence of a psalm-tune found in the _Genevan\r\nPsalter_ of 1551. It is ascribed here to one, Louis von Esch, but Dr.\r\nRobert McCutchan, editor of the _Methodist Hymnal_ and author of _Our\r\nHymnody_, says: “There is no basis whatever for ascribing it to any\r\nother than Barthélémon.”\r\n\r\nFrancois H. Barthélémon was born in Bordeaux, July 27, 1741, and died in\r\nLondon, July 20, 1808. He gave up his position as an officer in the\r\nFrench army to make music his profession and became a composer and\r\ndistinguished violinist and conductor in England. Most of his\r\ncompositions were of a secular nature. His other church pieces are\r\n“Morning Hymn” (25) and “Ballerma” (146, 585). Late in life Barthélémon\r\njoined the Swedenborgian Church. He died of paralysis at the age of 67.\r\n\r\n\r\n3, 4, 5. All hail the power of Jesus’ name    _Edward Perronet_, 1726-92\r\n\r\nThe original version of this hymn contained eight stanzas and first\r\nappeared in the _Gospel Magazine_, Augustus Toplady’s journal, the first\r\nstanza together with the tune “Miles Lane,” in November, 1779, and the\r\nremaining stanzas in April, 1780. It is one of the popular, stirring\r\nhymns of the English language, sung in England almost invariably to the\r\ntune “Miles Lane” and in America more generally to “Coronation.”\r\n\r\nEdward Perronet was born in 1726 and became a vicar in the Church of\r\nEngland in Shoreham. Later, under the influence of John Wesley, he left\r\nthe established church to become an itinerant Methodist preacher. After\r\nsome years he left the Methodists and ministered to a small dissenting\r\ncongregation in Canterbury, where he died in 1792.\r\n\r\nThe fourth stanza is attributed by some authorities to the Rev. John\r\nRippon, a Baptist minister.\r\n\r\nA missionary in India, E. P. Scott, went to visit a mountain tribe when\r\none day he found himself surrounded with a number of wild, ferocious\r\ntribesmen, pointing their spears at him. Expecting death, he closed his\r\neyes and sang this hymn, “All hail the power of Jesus’ name,” playing\r\nthe tune “Miles Lane” on his violin. The music and words produced such a\r\nprofound effect upon these wild tribesmen that they spared Scott’s life\r\nand invited him to settle among them. For over two years, until his\r\nhealth failed, he worked with great success among them, and when he was\r\ncompelled to return to America, they accompanied him thirty or forty\r\nmiles and begged him to return. Upon regaining his health, he did return\r\nand labored with them until his death.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MILES LANE (No. 3) was composed by William Shrubsole,\r\n1760-1806, especially for this hymn. He was an intimate friend of the\r\nauthor of the hymn. Most of his life was spent as music teacher and\r\norganist in various English churches. The tune is very effective,\r\nespecially in its thrilling climax in the fourfold repetition of “Crown\r\nHim.” However, due to its wide melodic range, its sustained notes, and\r\ninterrupted pace, it is more difficult to sing than “Coronation.”\r\n\r\nCORONATION (No. 4) was composed by Oliver Holden. He had little formal\r\ntraining in music and was a carpenter by trade. He was born in Shirley,\r\nMass., Sept. 18, 1765. After the English burned Charlestown, across the\r\nriver from Boston, Holden helped in the task of rebuilding and made\r\nconsiderable money. Later he engaged in the real estate business, owned\r\na music store, and all the while led choirs and singing schools. He was\r\nelected representative to the Congress. He was an influential citizen\r\nand a prominent member of the Baptist Church. However, he is remembered\r\nby posterity as the composer of this much-loved tune.\r\n\r\nDIADEM (No. 5) is an effective tune widely used on anniversary\r\noccasions. The composer, James Ellor, an English Methodist, was born in\r\nLancashire in 1819. He was not a professional musician, but a hatter by\r\ntrade. For a time he worked as a railway employee. While still a young\r\nman, he came to America, where he worked at the hatmaking trade. For\r\nsome years before his death in 1899, he was nearly blind. This tune was\r\ncomposed when Ellor was only 19 years old. It was written especially for\r\nthis hymn and has had wide use as a choir number.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim    _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nThis hymn by Charles Wesley, perhaps the greatest hymnist of all ages,\r\nwas No. 1 in a collection published in 1774 and entitled, _Hymns for\r\nTimes of Trouble and Persecution_. The original had six stanzas and was\r\nmarked, “To be sung in a tumult.” The Wesleys knew the meaning of\r\npersecution and tumults. They were often attacked by godless men who\r\nused physical violence. Hoodlums were known to try to break up their\r\nmeetings by blowing horns, ringing bells, or barking in front of the\r\npreacher. Sometimes cattle were driven into the congregation. The\r\nWesleys were also opposed by the clergy and people of the established\r\nchurch who hated the upheavals and disturbances these men caused in the\r\nstaid and stolid church life of the times. Nothing could stop the\r\nWesleys or repress their enthusiasm. John, who once thanked God for\r\ngetting together such a “congregation of drunkards, swearers, and\r\nSabbath breakers,” continued his preaching; and Charles his hymn\r\nwriting. With the early apostles, the Wesleys could say, “We cannot but\r\nspeak the things which we have seen and heard.”\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley, John’s youngest brother, graduated from Oxford in 1729\r\nand became a devout priest in the Anglican Church. He came to Georgia in\r\n1735 as secretary to General Oglethorpe but after one year, he returned\r\nto England on account of failing health. The years from 1738 to 1756\r\nwere devoted whole heartedly to assisting his brother John in the great\r\nrevivalistic work among the masses of the common people in England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland. He was a prolific writer, being the author of\r\nabout 6,500 hymns. Of these only a few score survive, so difficult is it\r\nto write hymns that stand the test of time. Twenty-three of his hymns,\r\nmore than of any other author, are included in the _Hymnary_. Wesley,\r\nbeing Arminian in his theology (as opposed to the predestinarian views\r\nof Calvinism) emphasizes in his hymns the power of Christ to save to the\r\nuttermost. Others of his hymns surpass this one from the standpoint of\r\ngood literature, but very few equal its spirit of adoring praise and\r\nfervid enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HANOVER is a vigorous, singable, hymn-tune which has long been\r\nassociated with these words, although the tune “Lyons” (7), too, is\r\nfrequently set to this hymn. It is one of the earliest examples of the\r\nEnglish psalm-tune, as distinguished from the Genevan. The triple\r\nmeasure was novel and met with objection when it first appeared.\r\n\r\nThe composer, William Croft, 1678-1727, had a doctor’s degree in music\r\nand was organist, for a time, in Westminster Abbey, London, where his\r\nremains lie buried. He labored hard, amidst many discouragements, to\r\nimprove the music in the Church of England, and made for himself in the\r\nfield of sacred music, one of the greatest names in English musical\r\nhistory. His tunes and anthems are widely used.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. O worship the King, all glorious above      _Robert Grant_, 1779-1838\r\n\r\nA simple, yet majestic hymn, based on the magnificent 104th Psalm. A\r\ncareful reading of the Psalm will result in a new appreciation of this\r\nfree paraphrase by Grant.\r\n\r\nRobert Grant was born in Bombay, India. When six years old, his parents\r\nmoved to London. He received his education in Oxford, was admitted to\r\nthe bar, elected to Parliament in 1808, and then held various\r\nresponsible government positions, climaxed in 1834 by his appointment as\r\nGovernor of Bombay. He died at Delpoonie, India, where a medical school,\r\nbearing his name, was erected in his memory. Though a prominent man and\r\nactive in public affairs, Grant will be remembered principally as the\r\nauthor of this, his most important hymn. He wrote a number of other\r\nhymns but only this one and “Savior, when, in dust, to Thee” (145) have\r\nsurvived.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune LYONS is by Haydn, not the famous “Papa” Haydn who\r\nwrote symphonies, string quartets, and _The Creation_, but J. Michael\r\nHaydn, 1737-1806, a younger brother. He was born in Austria. Though\r\nself-taught in music (like his famous brother Franz), he became the\r\nteacher of many eminent musicians of his time, including Carl von Weber.\r\nHaydn was a warm-hearted, devout, and gifted man, and might have become\r\nfamous except for two things—his life was lived in the shadow of his\r\nmore illustrious brother, and he was too modest to permit most of his\r\nworks to be published.\r\n\r\nLYONS is a singable tune with a fine melodic curve and is strikingly\r\nsimilar to “Hanover” (6) with which it may be interchanged with good\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Come Thou Almighty King                     _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nThis hymn of praise and prayer is widely used in all branches of the\r\nChristian church in the English speaking world and has been translated\r\ninto many foreign languages. It has been generally attributed to Charles\r\nWesley, the great “Bard of Methodism,” but the authorship is uncertain.\r\nThe hymn appeared as the first of only two selections in a small booklet\r\npublished by John Wesley about 1757. The second hymn was by Charles\r\nWesley and was entitled, “The Backslider.” “Come, Thou Almighty King,”\r\nwith the title, “An Hymn to the Trinity,” did not bear the name of\r\nCharles Wesley, and it appears nowhere in his collected works. No one\r\ncan be certain, therefore, of the authorship or date of its writing.\r\nLike all good hymns, it rises above time or personal circumstance and\r\nexpresses for all Christians their feeling of praise and adoration of\r\nGod. It was originally sung to the tune, “God Save the King,” the hymn\r\nfollowing the same metrical pattern as the British National Anthem and\r\nour own “America.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ITALIAN HYMN, also called “Trinity,” and “Moscow,” is one of\r\nour most famous hymn tunes and deserves its renown. It was composed for\r\nthis hymn by Felice de Giardini, 1716-1796, an Italian violinist, who\r\nspent many years in England and ranked among the top-notch artists and\r\nteachers of violin in Europe. Though a great artist, he was a capricious\r\nand peevish personality, had few friends and many enemies, was a poor\r\nbusiness manager, and died in poverty and distress in the city of Moscow\r\nwhere he had gone to better his fortune and failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Christ is our Cornerstone                        _Latin, 8th century_\r\n                                            _Tr. John Chandler_, 1806-76\r\n\r\nThis is a translation of a mediaeval Latin hymn. At the beginning of the\r\nChristian era, the prevailing language was Greek. With the dominance of\r\nRome over the empire of Alexander the Great, Greek gradually gave way to\r\nthe Latin tongue, and from the fourth century to the dawn of the\r\nReformation, a rich treasury of Latin hymns came into existence in the\r\nchurch. Many of these have now been translated for use in modern English\r\nspeaking churches. They are stately, reverent, devout pieces of\r\ndevotional literature which have been the joy and consolation of\r\ncountless saintly souls down through the centuries. Other examples of\r\nhymns from Latin sources are found at Nos. 67, 80, 87, 114, 116, 171,\r\n277, 382, and 415.\r\n\r\n“Christ is our Cornerstone” is based on “_Angularis fundamentum_,” a\r\ndedication hymn of anonymous authorship, attributed here to the 8th\r\ncentury, but it may be of much earlier origin. Hymn 277, “Christ is made\r\nthe sure foundation,” is another rendering of the same Latin poem, by a\r\ndifferent translator and into a different meter, and is there dated “6th\r\nor 7th century.”\r\n\r\nJohn Chandler, the translator, was one of a group of Anglican clergymen\r\nbelonging to what was known in England as the Oxford Group (not to be\r\nconfused with the recent Oxford group movement headed by John Buchman).\r\nThey were interested in restoring to the church a dignified service of\r\nworship. These Latin hymns contributed to this purpose. Chandler was a\r\nscholar as well as preacher, author of several books and many printed\r\nsermons and tracts, and was one of the first and best translators of\r\nLatin hymns. This, of course, is not a literal translation, for\r\nconsideration had to be given to poetic and doctrinal fitness for modern\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune DARWALL was composed by John Darwall, 1731-89, an\r\nAnglican clergyman and also an enthusiastic amateur musician. He\r\ncomposed a tune for each of the 150 metrical Psalms, each written in two\r\nparts only, treble and bass. DARWALL was set to Psalm 148. His tunes,\r\nfor the most part, have not been published and have passed into\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Joyful, joyful we adore Thee             _Henry van Dyke_, 1852-1933\r\n\r\nA nature hymn of the first order, written by one who himself had a\r\nprofound appreciation and love of the out-of-doors. The words from\r\nbeginning to end are an expression of the beauty in nature and the\r\nresulting joy and spirit of praise it brings to the worshipper. The hymn\r\nwas written in 1907 while the author was on a preaching visit to\r\nWilliams College; it was designated to be sung to the “Hymn to Joy” in\r\nthe last movement of Beethoven’s _Ninth Symphony_. The words fit the\r\nmusic perfectly. It is one of the most joyful hymns in the English\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nHenry van Dyke was born in Germantown, Pa.; received his education in\r\nPrinceton University and Theological Seminary; and began his work as\r\npastor of the United Congregational Church in Newport, R. I. After four\r\nyears he was called to the pulpit of the Brick Presbyterian Church in\r\nNew York where he became a widely known figure. In 1900 he was called to\r\nthe chair of English Literature in Princeton. He was a friend of\r\nPresident Woodrow Wilson who appointed van Dyke as minister to the\r\nNetherlands and Luxemburg, which post he held from 1913 to 1917. He is\r\nthe author of many books, including the beautiful story entitled, _The\r\nOther Wise Man._\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HYMN TO JOY is a hymn tune arrangement from the fourth movement\r\nof Beethoven’s _Ninth Symphony_, probably the greatest symphony ever\r\npenned, even though the composer was stone-deaf when he wrote it.\r\n\r\nLudwig von Beethoven was born at Bonn, Germany, in 1770 and died in\r\nVienna in 1827. During his tempestuous life, he composed many\r\ncompositions for piano, violin, orchestra, and string quartet. His nine\r\nsymphonies are on the repertoire of all the great modern symphony\r\norchestras.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Give to our God immortal praise             _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nRecognized as the best of three versions which Watts made of Psalm 136.\r\nThe hymn expresses with dignity and fervor the high praise of God.\r\n\r\nIsaac Watts, scholar, poet, and pastor of the Independent Church in Mark\r\nLane, London, ranks among the greatest of English hymn writers. He is\r\nthe author of about 600 hymns and versions, many of which are still in\r\ncommon use. The _Hymnary_ contains 19 of his works. Watts is often\r\nreferred to as the “father of English hymnody.” Though suffering from\r\nbodily ailments during the greater part of his adult life, he was robust\r\nin his thinking and became a bold and sturdy fighter for the cause of\r\nintellectual and religious freedom. Watts was one of the gentlest and\r\nkindest of men and a friend of the young. His wide intellectual\r\ninterests enabled him to write textbooks on logic, geography, and\r\nastronomy, which were used in the universities of England as well as\r\nHarvard and Yale. Though he was never married and had no children of his\r\nown, Watts was a lover of children and wrote one of the world’s most\r\nbeautiful cradle songs—“Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber.” In 1715,\r\nhe issued a notable book of verse for children. One of the poems,\r\nentitled, “Against Quarrelling and Fighting,” runs as follows:\r\n\r\n  Let dogs delight to bark and bite\r\n    For God hath made them so;\r\n  Let bears and lions growl and fight\r\n    For ’tis their nature to.\r\n\r\n  But children, you should never let\r\n    Such angry passions rise;\r\n  Your little hands were never made\r\n    To tear each other’s eyes.\r\n\r\nLet grown-ups in our day grasp the idea in this simple poem!\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune, LASST UNS ERFREUEN, one of the most famous in any\r\nhymn book, was published in _Geistliche Kirchengesäng_, Cologne, 1623.\r\nIt was set to an Easter hymn beginning, “_Lasst uns erfreuen herzlich\r\nsehr_,” from whence it derives its name. The tune is unusual for its\r\nsimplicity of structure and its invariable repetition of phrases\r\nthroughout. Usually the alleluias in lines 3 and 6 are sung in harmony,\r\nthe rest of the song in unison. The tune lends itself well to antiphonal\r\nor echo singing on the rare occasions when such varied effects are\r\ndesired. The composer is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. O for a thousand tongues to sing           _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nFrom a poem of 18 stanzas, written by Wesley to celebrate the first\r\nanniversary of his great spiritual change, a conversion experience in\r\nwhich he felt the clear light of the Gospel possessing his soul. The\r\npoem was entitled, “For the Anniversary Day of One’s Conversion.” Wesley\r\nwas greatly influenced by the Moravian missionary Peter Bohler who once\r\nsaid to him: “Had I a thousand tongues, I would praise Him with them\r\nall.” The incident, lingering in Wesley’s mind, was turned into a song\r\nwhich expresses the joy and confidence of the redeemed. For 150 years,\r\nand until recently, this hymn appeared as No. 1 in Methodist hymnbooks\r\non both sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ AZMON was introduced into this country from Germany where it\r\nwas a favorite school song. Carl G. Gläser, the composer, was born at\r\nWeissenfels, Germany, 1784, and died at Barmen, 1829. He was a teacher\r\nof piano, violin, and voice, and director of choruses. He also owned and\r\nmanaged a music store.\r\n\r\nLowell Mason, the arranger of the tune, was one of America’s earliest\r\nexponents and teachers of public school music and did much to bring\r\nworthy popular hymn tunes into the churches. He was born January 8,\r\n1792, at Orange, N. J. At the age of 16, he was a choir leader and\r\nteacher of singing classes. At 23, he went to Savannah, Ga., as a bank\r\nclerk, returning to Boston in 1827 to become president and conductor of\r\nthe Handel and Haydn Society. He wrote a large number of singable hymn\r\ntunes which have had wide use in the hymn books of all denominations.\r\nMore of his compositions are found in the _Hymnary_ than of any other\r\ncomposer. He died at Orange, N. J., August 11, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. Great God, the followers of Thy Son     _Henry Ware, Jr._, 1794-1843\r\n\r\nWritten for an ordination service which took place in Baltimore in 1819,\r\nWilliam E. Channing preaching the sermon.\r\n\r\nThe author, Henry Ware, Jr., was born at Hingham, Mass., April 21, 1794;\r\ndied September 25, 1843, at Framingham, Mass. He was educated at\r\nHarvard, and served as minister of the Second Unitarian Church, Boston,\r\n1817 to 1829, with Ralph Waldo Emerson as assistant for a time. From\r\n1829 to 1842, he was Professor of Pulpit Eloquence and Pastoral Care in\r\nthe Harvard Divinity School. He was editor of the _Christian Disciple_\r\nand later of the _Christian Register_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ For comments on Lowell Mason, composer of HEBRON, see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. The God of Abraham praise           _Daniel Ben Judah, 14th century_\r\n                            _Revised version by Thomas Olivers_, 1725-99\r\n\r\nThis praise hymn, with its magnificent tune, had its origin in a Jewish\r\nsynagogue in London. Thomas Olivers, a Welshman and follower of John\r\nWesley, spent fifty years of his life as a Methodist minister, during\r\nwhich time he travelled more than 100,000 miles on horseback in his\r\nevangelistic work. His fame, however, rests upon this hymn. While\r\nvisiting in London, he went to the Great Synagogue in Duke’s Place and\r\nheard the cantor sing the Hebrew _Yigdal_ or doxology, in which the\r\narticles of the Jewish faith are recited. Upon hearing this, Oliver\r\nwrote “The God of Abraham praise,” a Christian version of the _Yigdal_.\r\nThe original is by Daniel Ben Judah of the 14th century. Oliver then\r\ncalled on the Cantor, Meyer Leoni, who gave him this melody to suit the\r\nhymn he had written.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LEONI, according to Winfield Douglas, is probably not older\r\nthan the 17th century and is not related to ancient Jewish music.\r\nAlthough written in a minor key, it strikes the note of praise. Its\r\nrhythm and vigor of movement adapts it well for use as a processional or\r\nrecessional hymn.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. We praise Thee, O God, our Redeemer        _Julia Bulkley Cady Cory_\r\n\r\nA notable hymn of praise written by Mrs. Julia Cady Cory, who was born\r\nand reared in what was reputed to be one of the happiest Christian homes\r\nin New York City. Her father, J. Cleveland Cady, was a nationally known\r\narchitect. A devout Christian, he had a genuine love for boys and girls\r\nand was superintendent of the same Sunday school for fifty-two years.\r\nConcerning the origin of this hymn, Mrs. Cory has written:\r\n\r\n  Years before I was married (in 1902), the organist of the Brick\r\n  Presbyterian Church of New York City, knowing of my interest in\r\n  hymnology, came to me and told me that he had a very fine Netherlands\r\n  melody associated with most militaristic and unchristian words. He\r\n  lamented the fact, and requested me to write more suitable words,\r\n  which could be used for the Thanksgiving service at the Brick Church.\r\n  The hymn as you see it today, was the result.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ KREMSER is named after Edward Kremser, 1838-1914, a Viennese\r\nmusician who arranged the tune from a Netherlands melody dating to 1625.\r\nThe composer is not known. It is a stirring piece of music, simple in\r\nstyle, and easy to sing. It is equally impressive, whether sung in\r\nmeasured, stately tones like a chorale, or in the gayer festive mood in\r\nwhich young people like to sing. Children and young people usually\r\nrespond to this hymn with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. Praise the Lord: ye heavens adore Him            _Foundling Hospital\r\n                                                             Collection_\r\n                                   _Stanza 3 by Edward Osler_, 1798-1863\r\n\r\nA free rendering of some lines of Psalm 148 in which all the hosts of\r\nheaven and earth join in a magnificent chorus of praise to God.\r\n\r\nThe first two stanzas are anonymous. They were first published in the\r\n_Foundling Hospital Collection_, a book of hymns and anthems compiled by\r\nThomas Coram, an English seaman, merchant captain and philanthropist. In\r\nlater life, Mr. Coram devoted his time and fortune to the support of a\r\nchildren’s hospital in which a chapel was also maintained and the\r\nchildren trained in singing.\r\n\r\nEdward Osler, author of the third stanza, was an English surgeon and\r\nauthor of books on scientific as well as religious subjects. He was also\r\na distinguished hymnologist and wrote a number of versions of the Psalms\r\nand hymns for use in the Church of England.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FABEN was composed by John Henry Wilcox, 1827-75, Boston\r\norganist and expert in organ construction. The tune should not be taken\r\ntoo fast; otherwise the short notes become choppy and the effect is\r\nspoiled. Singers should avoid slurring the intervals of the melody,\r\nespecially the descending fourth at the end of the first, third and\r\nseventh lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. Come, let us join our cheerful songs        _Isaac Watts,_ 1674-1748\r\n\r\nA paraphrase of Revelation 5:11-13. It is one of the most widely\r\nesteemed of Watts’ poems and one of the classics of English hymnody.\r\n\r\nThe basses and tenors would be less likely to sing the wrong words at\r\nthe beginning of the third score if the lines of all four stanzas had\r\nbeen printed. Let the song leader remind them to look ahead for the\r\nproper lines of each stanza before singing their solo part, and so avoid\r\nsome incongruities of thought!\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CAMBRIDGE is an effective tune but with most congregations it\r\nneeds some rehearsal before it is usable in a worship service. The\r\ncomposer, John Randall, 1715-99, was an organist and Professor of Music\r\nin Cambridge University. He was a friend of the poet Thomas Gray.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. O come, loud anthems let us sing                    _Tate and Brady_\r\n\r\nA metrical version of Psalm 95, by Tate and Brady, two Irishmen who\r\ncollaborated in producing, in 1696, the _New Version_ of the Psalms.\r\nTheir work partly supplanted the older version by Sternhold and Hopkins,\r\nthen in use.\r\n\r\nNahum Tate, 1652-1715, was the son of an Irish clergyman, and, like\r\nBrady, received his education at Trinity College, Dublin. He was only a\r\nsecond-rate poet but managed to receive appointment as Poet Laureate of\r\nEngland in 1690.\r\n\r\nNicholas Brady, 1659-1726, was granted the honorary degree of Doctor of\r\nDivinity from Dublin University for services rendered to the Protestant\r\ncause. Among his many appointments were the chaplaincy to the king of\r\nEngland and incumbency of Stratford-on-Avon. Tate and Brady recast all\r\nof the Psalms into metrical verse in an attempt to improve on the old\r\nversion then in use in the churches. Their work was done in a day when\r\nonly the psalms were permitted to be sung in worship services in\r\nEngland. The writing of hymns was still in the future. Only a few of\r\ntheir renderings still find a place among our modern English hymns. The\r\n_Hymnary_ includes two besides this one, Nos. 583 and 586.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune was found in _St. Basil’s Hymn Book_ where it is\r\ncredited to Haydn, but we are not told which Haydn. No further\r\ninformation concerning its origin has been traced. It is especially\r\neffective when sung by a large congregation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MORNING\r\n\r\n\r\n19. When morning gilds the skies                          _19th century_\r\n                                               _Tr. E. Caswall_, 1814-78\r\n\r\nA radiant morning hymn of adoration. It comes from the German song, “Bei\r\nfrühem Morgenlicht,” of unknown authorship, which first appeared in\r\nprint in the _Katholisches Gesangbuch_, 1828, bearing the title, “A\r\nChristian Greeting.”\r\n\r\n  Bei frühem Morgenlicht\r\n  Erwacht mein Herz und spricht.\r\n    Gelobt sei Jesus Christus!\r\n  So sing ich früh and spät,\r\n  Bei Arbeit und Gebet,\r\n    Gelobt sei Jesus Christus!\r\n\r\nThe translator, Edward Caswall, was an English scholar and clergyman,\r\neducated at Oxford. He left the Church of England to become a Roman\r\nCatholic priest. Caswall did much for the sick poor and the poor\r\nchildren in Birmingham, England, where he lived. He wrote excellent\r\noriginal hymns and made many translations from German and Latin sources.\r\n(See Nos. 88 and 155.)\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ O SEIGNEUR was composed or arranged by the Frenchman L.\r\nBourgeois, _c._ 1500- _c._ 1561, who was an adherent of Calvin and\r\nfollowed him to Geneva in 1541. He was assigned by Calvin the task of\r\nproviding music for the metrical psalter, but his work was attended with\r\ntroubles and difficulties. Once he was thrown in prison for making\r\nunauthorized alterations in certain well-known tunes. He tried hard to\r\nintroduce part-singing in a day when only unison singing was permitted\r\nby Calvin. Not succeeding in this, he left Geneva and returned to Paris,\r\nhis birthplace. O SEIGNEUR is a superb tune. It gathers interest and\r\nforce throughout its considerable length. The tune, which also may be\r\nused as a choir anthem, should be sung in fairly lively tempo to bring\r\nout its extraordinary power.\r\n\r\n\r\n20. Lord, in the morning                        _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nBased on Psalm 5:3: “My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in\r\nthe morning will I direct my prayer to thee, and will look up.” Watts\r\ndid not hesitate to change the wording of the Psalms, when necessary, to\r\n“Christianize” them. In the preface to his book of _Psalms_, he states\r\nhis method and purpose in these words:\r\n\r\n  It is necessary that I should inform my readers that they are not to\r\n  expect in this book an exact translation of the Psalms of David. My\r\n  design is to accommodate the Book of Psalms to Christian Worship.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Watts see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WARWICK, a psalm-tune of somewhat ornamental style, was\r\ncomposed by Samuel Stanley, 1767-1822, who for thirty-three years was\r\nthe leader of singing in Carr’s Lane Meeting House, Birmingham, England,\r\nwhere he made its music famous. He was a noted violincellist and an\r\nauthority on the music of Handel. His position in the church was not\r\nthen considered inconsistent with his being, for a time, keeper of the\r\ntown tavern.\r\n\r\n\r\n21. When morning gilds the skies         _19th century, Tr. E. Caswall_,\r\n                                                                 1814-78\r\n\r\nFor comments on the words see Hymn 19.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LAUDES DOMINI was composed by Joseph Barnby, 1838-96, an\r\nEnglish organist and one of the most prolific hymn-tune writers of his\r\ntime. He was conductor of the Royal Choral Society in London, which\r\npresented many splendid performances of the great oratorios. It is a\r\nreverent and vigorous tune, written especially for this hymn, and makes\r\na good processional.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. New every morning is the love                _John Keble_, 1792-1866\r\n\r\nTaken from John Keble’s _Christian Year_, a book of devotional poetry,\r\none of the great religious classics in the English language. The\r\noriginal poem of sixteen stanzas is based on Lamentations 3:22b, 23a:\r\n“His compassions fail not. They are new every morning.” The hymn shows a\r\ndeep appreciation of the beauties of the natural world, linking them\r\nwith the worship of God.\r\n\r\nJohn Keble was educated at Oxford where he was an outstandingly\r\nbrilliant student. Later he taught at Oxford for nine years and then\r\nspent thirteen years as curate in his father’s church in\r\nGloucestershire. Following that he became vicar of Hursley where he\r\nrebuilt the parish church with profits from his book, _The Christian\r\nYear_, which passed through 90 editions during the author’s lifetime.\r\nKeble was one of the influential leaders in the so-called Oxford or\r\nTractarian Movement in England, an effort to emphasize worthier ideas of\r\nthe church and a greater dignity and beauty in worship.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MELCOMBE, a melody of fine balance and great dignity, was\r\ncomposed by Samuel Webbe, 1740-1816, son of an English government\r\nofficial in Minorca. He spent his early life as a cabinetmaker but later\r\nturned to music, becoming a noted organist and composer of a large\r\nquantity of secular and sacred music.\r\n\r\n\r\n23. Still, still with Thee              _Harriet Beecher Stowe_, 1811-96\r\n\r\nBased on Psalm 139:18: “When I awake I am still with Thee.” It is a\r\nbeautiful, personal, morning hymn, expressing the soul’s adoration upon\r\nwaking to find itself in the glad consciousness of the divine presence.\r\n\r\nHarriet Beecher Stowe belonged to a famous American family. Her father,\r\nLyman Beecher, and her brother, Henry Ward Beecher, were eloquent and\r\ninfluential preachers in the Presbyterian and Congregational churches,\r\nrespectively. Harriet’s girlhood was spent in Cincinnati, Ohio, where\r\nher father was president of Lane Theological Seminary. She married\r\nCalvin Ellis Stowe, of the Lane faculty. In 1852, she published _Uncle\r\nTom’s Cabin_, a story which became immensely popular and made a notable\r\ncontribution to the cause of freedom for the slaves.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CONSOLATION is No. 9 of the 48 pieces, all of distinctive lyric\r\nquality, composed by Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, and known as _Songs\r\nwithout Words._ The tune appears here in slightly modified form. It is\r\nwell adapted for the hymn but suffers frequently from dragging. It\r\nshould be sung with a steady pace and clearly defined rhythm.\r\n\r\nFelix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy was born in Hamburg, Germany, 1809, the son\r\nof a Jewish banker. His father, Abraham Mendelssohn, wished the children\r\nto be brought up as Protestant Christians and added the name “Bartholdy”\r\nto distinguish them from the Jewish members of the family. “Bartholdy”\r\nwas the name of the proprietor of the garden belonging to the family.\r\nMendelssohn composed extensively for the piano and wrote symphonies for\r\nthe orchestra. Among his choral works are the great oratorios, _Elijah_\r\nand _St. Paul_. A man of culture and wealth, he travelled extensively\r\nand was popular wherever he went, especially in England. He died in\r\nLeipzig in 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n24. Father, we praise Thee                  _Gregory the Great_, 540-604\r\n                                          _Tr. Percy Dearmer_, 1867-1936\r\n\r\nThe original of this morning hymn is attributed to Gregory the Great,\r\nPope Gregory I, a sincere man, devoted to missions and reforms within\r\nthe church, and one of the greatest of the line of Popes. The date of\r\nhis election to the papacy, A.D. 590, is usually given by church\r\nhistorians as the end of the period of the Ancient Church and the\r\nbeginning of the period of the Middle Ages—a witness to the importance\r\nof Gregory. A man of unblemished character and statesmanlike wisdom, he\r\nhad a noble vision and ambition for Christianity and took a keen\r\ninterest in the ritual and music of the church. Though not original or\r\nscholarly, he was a voluminous writer and had much influence in his\r\ntime. He sent out missionaries, such as Augustine to England, and\r\nlabored incessantly to purify and strengthen the church, care for its\r\npoor, and bring Christianity to the heathen. Gregory was particularly\r\ninterested in the music of the church; and the “Gregorian Chants,” many\r\nof them composed by him, became the basis of cathedral music for a\r\nthousand years. He did away with certain embellishments which had crept\r\nin through the influence of Ambrose, and inaugurated the use of the\r\nsolemn, stately chants which bear his name.\r\n\r\nThe translation of this hymn is by Percy Dearmer, an English hymnologist\r\nand clergyman who became Canon of Westminster, London, in 1931. He\r\nedited _Songs of Praise_, adopted widely in England for use in churches\r\nand public schools.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CHRISTI SANCTORUM is a tune of uncertain origin taken from a\r\nbook by Francois de la Feillée, entitled _Methode du Plain Chant_,\r\npublished in 1782. The melody, easily within range of all voices, is\r\nwell adapted for unison singing. It is most effective when sung somewhat\r\nslowly. Though the tune appears in a book of plainsong, the melody has\r\nrhythm and is measured, and has none of the characteristics of a\r\nplainsong.\r\n\r\n\r\n25. Awake, my soul, and with the sun             _Thomas Ken_, 1637-1711\r\n\r\nTaken from a _Manual of Prayers_, which Bishop Ken wrote for Winchester\r\nCollege students in 1674. It appeared as the “Morning Hymn.” The preface\r\nof the book admonished the boys “to be sure to sing the Morning and\r\nEvening Hymn in your chamber devoutly.” Both the Morning and Evening\r\nHymn (33) had for the closing stanza the famous doxology, “Praise God\r\nfrom whom all blessings flow,” now sung by the whole Christian church.\r\nThe original poem had fourteen stanzas. According to Julian, this hymn\r\nis one of four at the head of all hymns in the English language.\r\n\r\nThomas Ken was an English poet and clergyman and had considerable\r\nmusical talent. He was a man unafraid to declare his convictions. He\r\nonce refused to read, at the king’s command, a certain document to his\r\nparishioners, and was imprisoned for his defiance. He finally lost his\r\nbishopric because he refused to swear allegiance to Mary and William of\r\nOrange when they became rulers of England. Ken was known for his saintly\r\ncharacter, his great ability and eloquence as a preacher, and his\r\npioneering in the art of hymn writing.\r\n\r\nThat all hymns must be written in the third person, as is sometimes\r\nasserted, is disproved by this great hymn in its use of “I” and “my.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ For comments on Francois H. Barthélémon, composer of the tune,\r\nMORNING HYMN, see Hymn 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n26. Christ, whose glory fills the skies        _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest morning hymns in the English language, based on Mal.\r\n4:2: “But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness\r\narise with healing in his wings.” James Montgomery called it “one of\r\nCharles Wesley’s loveliest progeny.” It pictures Christ as the true\r\nLight and the Sun of Righteousness triumphing over the darkness of sin\r\nand grief.\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley was the second youngest in a family of nineteen children\r\nand became the “sweet singer of Methodism.” He and Isaac Watts were the\r\nmost important hymnists of the 18th century in England.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LUX PRIMA is by the French composer, Charles F. Gounod,\r\n1818-93, a musician of a deeply religious nature. Gounod had taken two\r\nyears of theology with the expectation of becoming ordained, but later\r\ndecided that his greatest contribution to religion would be through\r\nmusic. His outstanding religious work is the oratorio, _The Redemption_.\r\nWhile composing it, he used to spend hours in Notre Dame Cathedral in\r\nprayer and meditation. LUX PRIMA is a stirring tune, building up to a\r\nclimax at “Day-star,” and is widely used as a processional.\r\n\r\n\r\n27. Come, my soul, thou must be waking       _F. R. von Canitz_, 1654-99\r\n                                            _Tr. H. J. Buckoll_, 1803-71\r\n\r\nFrom a book of German lyrics, translated by H. J. Buckoll. The original\r\npoem of 13 stanzas begins with the words, “_Seele, du muszt munter\r\nwerden_.” The hymn, expressing the glories of a new day, is especially\r\nsuitable for use in schools and colleges. It is a translation of stanzas\r\n1, 6, 8, 10, and 11 of the original:\r\n\r\n  Seele, du musst munter werden!\r\n    Denn der Erden\r\n  Blickt hervor ein neuer Tag.\r\n  Komm, dem Schöpfer dieser Strahlen\r\n    Zu bezahlen,\r\n  Was dein schwacher Trieb vermag.\r\n\r\n  Bitte, dass er dir Gedeihen\r\n    Mag verleihen,\r\n  Wenn du auf was Gutes zielst;\r\n  Aber dass er dich mag stören\r\n    Und bekehren\r\n  Wenn du böse Regung fühlst.\r\n\r\n  Denk, dass er auf deinen Wegen\r\n    Ist zugegen,\r\n  Und erkennet, was du tust;\r\n  Dass er auch verborgne Flecken\r\n    Kann entdecken,\r\n  Und die tiefste Sündenlust.\r\n\r\n  Drum so seufze, dass dein Scheiden\r\n    Nicht ein Leiden,\r\n  Sondern sanftes Schlafen sei—\r\n  Dass ich seh’ mit ew’ger Wonne\r\n    Jene Sonne,\r\n  Wann des Todes Nacht vorbei.\r\n\r\n  Treib’ nur Gottes Gnadenblicke\r\n    Nicht zurücke\r\n  Fasse treulich ihren Schein;\r\n  Dann wird deiner Seele Frieden\r\n    Schon hienieden\r\n  Süsser als die Sonne sein.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Rudolph Ludwig, Freiherr von Canitz, was born in Berlin in\r\n1654. He was a distinguished diplomat, a philanthropist, and a devout\r\nChristian. In the early morning of his last day on earth, August 11,\r\n1699, ill with dropsy, he gazed at the rising sun and exclaimed, “Oh, if\r\nthe sight of this created sun is so charming and beautiful, what will be\r\nthe sight of the unspeakable glory of the Creator himself!” He was\r\n_Staatrath_ (State Counsellor) at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nThe translator, Rev. Henry J. Buckoll, was educated at Oxford and spent\r\nmost of his life teaching. He edited several collections of songs for\r\nschools and in 1842 published _Hymns Translated from the German_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HAYDN comes from a tune in one of the movements of a string\r\nquartet by Franz Joseph Haydn, 1732-1809, the great Austrian composer,\r\nand important figure in the history of music. He was affectionately\r\nnamed “Papa Haydn” by Mozart. He wrote church music, song, opera, and\r\noratorio, over 100 symphonies and 83 string quartets. His _Creation_, a\r\nsacred oratorio, is widely known. He was devoutly religious and did not\r\nhesitate to ascribe his musical scores to God’s glory. He gave as one of\r\nhis reasons for writing music: “that the weary and worn or the man\r\nburdened with affairs might enjoy something of solace and refreshment.”\r\nThere is a cheerfulness and optimism about his music which appeals to\r\namateur and professional alike. Haydn was a teacher as well as composer\r\nand numbered among his pupils Mozart and Beethoven.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EVENING\r\n\r\n\r\n28. Now on land and sea descending          _Samuel Longfellow_, 1819-92\r\n\r\nWritten for use in a series of vesper services the author was conducting\r\nin his church. It was published, with other hymns, in a small book\r\ncalled _Vespers_. This hymn and “Again as evening’s shadow falls” (No.\r\n280), also by Longfellow, have become two of the most-loved evening\r\nhymns in the English language.\r\n\r\nSamuel Longfellow, younger brother of the poet, Henry Wadsworth\r\nLongfellow, was born and died in Portland, Maine. He was educated at\r\nHarvard for the ministry and served congregations in Fall River, Mass.;\r\nBrooklyn; and Germantown, Pa., resigning the last charge to write his\r\nbrother’s _Life_, 1886. Though a Unitarian, he speaks of Christ as Lord\r\nand Saviour and accepted the miracles of the New Testament. He edited\r\nseveral important hymn books and wrote a number of hymns of excellent\r\nquality. Thirteen of his compositions are included in the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ VESPERS is by the Russian composer Dimitri Stephanovitch\r\nBortniansky who was born at Gloukoff, in the Ukraine, 1752, and died at\r\nSt. Petersburg, 1825. He studied music at Moscow, St. Petersburg, and\r\nVenice, Italy, the Empress Catherine of Russia supplying the necessary\r\nfunds. (It was this Empress Catherine who extended an invitation in 1786\r\nto Prussian Mennonites to settle in South Russia, promising religious\r\ntoleration, military exemption, and other special privileges.)\r\nBortniansky became Director of the Imperial Kapelle, the Empress’ Church\r\nChoir. He was a distinguished composer of sacred music and has had a\r\ngreat and lasting influence on Russian church music. From his pen came\r\nthe well-known chorale tune, “_Ich bete an die Macht der Liebe_” (No.\r\n517).\r\n\r\nThe word “Jubilate” means “to shout for joy.” It comes from the same\r\nLatin root as “jubilee” and “jubilant.” Its English pronunciation in\r\nsinging is Jōo-bĭ-lä-tĭ. If you prefer the Latin, sing it\r\nYōo-bā-lä-tĭ.\r\n\r\n\r\n29. Now the day is over                 _Sabine Baring-Gould_, 1834-1924\r\n\r\nBased on Proverbs 3:24:\r\n\r\n  “When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid;\r\n  Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written for children, but is suitable for worshippers of\r\nall ages.\r\n\r\nSabine Baring-Gould was educated at Cambridge and became a clergyman of\r\nthe Church of England. He was a man of great industry and versatility,\r\nand possessed a wide range of interests. He wrote books on travel,\r\nbiography, history, and is the author of several novels. He also edited\r\nseveral collections of folk songs. Baring-Gould is the author of “Onward\r\nChristian soldiers,” another hymn written for children, which has\r\nreceived a much wider use than originally intended.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MERRIAL is a favorite tune for choir use in evening services.\r\nThe average congregation can learn to sing it without difficulty, and\r\nwhen sung slowly and thoughtfully, it constitutes a deeply moving\r\nevening prayer.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Joseph Barnby, see Hymn 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n30. Sun of my soul, Thou Savior dear             _John Keble_, 1792-1866\r\n\r\nAnother evening hymn, widely used, and destined to live as long as\r\nEnglish hymns are sung. It is taken from the author’s _Christian Year_,\r\na book of devotional poetry which sold 305,500 copies in forty-six\r\nyears. The original poem of fourteen stanzas, composed November 25,\r\n1820, appeared with the title, “’Tis Gone, that Bright and Orbèd Blaze,”\r\nand was headed with the text, “Abide with us” (Luke 24:29). The hymn\r\nrepresents a lone traveller pressing on his way after the sun has set,\r\nbut trusting in Christ, the “Sun of the soul,” for guidance and\r\nprotection, and lifting a prayer for the sick and poor and the helpless.\r\nTennyson, too, likened Christ to the sun. Asked what Christ meant to him\r\nhe paused beside a flower in the garden and answered: “What the sun is\r\nto that flower, Jesus Christ is to my soul. He is the Sun of my soul.”\r\n\r\nFor further comments on John Keble see Hymn 22.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HURSLEY is a good tune but not as good as the original,\r\n“_Grosser Gott, wir loben Dich_” (No. 519), from which some unknown\r\nperson adapted it. The melody and harmonization have been changed, not\r\nfor the better, to suit the English words. “Hursley” was the name of the\r\nparish of which Keble was vicar, and the tune was doubtless given this\r\nname when it came to be associated with Keble’s hymn.\r\n\r\n\r\n31. Day is dying in the west                  _Mary Lathbury_, 1841-1913\r\n\r\nAn evening hymn of high rank which has been used widely in American\r\nchurches during the past half century.\r\n\r\nMary A. Lathbury, daughter of a Methodist minister, was a successful art\r\nteacher but is remembered chiefly for her work with the Methodist Sunday\r\nSchool Union and her literary contributions to periodicals for young\r\npeople. The “Look Up” Legion which she founded had for its motto, Edward\r\nEverett Hale’s four rules of good conduct:\r\n\r\n  Look up, not down;\r\n  Look forward, not back;\r\n  Look out, not in,\r\n  And lend a hand.\r\n\r\nMiss Lathbury wrote this hymn for use at the vesper services at Lake\r\nChautauqua, in western New York, where hundreds of young people, eager\r\nto deepen their spiritual life, have met every year since 1873 for Bible\r\nstudy and prayer. This hymn and “Break Thou the Bread of Life” give the\r\nauthor a permanent place in American hymnody.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CHAUTAUQUA was written especially for Miss Lathbury’s hymn.\r\nWilliam F. Sherwin, 1826-88, studied music under Lowell Mason and later\r\nbecame a teacher of vocal music. He was unusually successful in leading\r\nchoral groups and was appointed music director at Lake Chautauqua. The\r\ntune is dignified and stately, yet simple. The refrain should be sung\r\nsoftly at the beginning and rise gradually to a climax.\r\n\r\n\r\n32. Darkening night the land doth cover                    _Anon. Greek_\r\n                                         _Tr. Robert Bridges_, 1844-1930\r\n\r\nFrom an anonymous 8th-century or earlier Greek hymn. Some authorities\r\nbelieve it to be an expansion of the Greek candle lighting hymn (No.\r\n34), also translated by Robert Bridges. The editors of the _Hymnary_, in\r\nsearch of a poem to fit the well-known UNTER LILIEN JENER FREUDEN tune\r\nin the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_, found for it this beautiful evening hymn\r\npublished in the _American Oxford Hymnal_.\r\n\r\nThe translator, Robert Bridges, was one of England’s great literary\r\nscholars who gave serious attention to hymnology. After graduating from\r\nEton and Oxford, he turned his attention to medicine and became a\r\ndistinguished surgeon. At the early age of 38, however, he retired from\r\nmedicine to give himself to literature and music. In 1913, he was made\r\nPoet Laureate of England. His most significant work in hymnology was the\r\nfamous _Yattendon Hymnal_, which he published in 1899 while living in\r\nthe village of Yattendon. It consisted of 100 hymns, 44 of which were\r\nfrom his own pen, either as author or translator. The hymns were set to\r\nmusic derived largely from the _Genevan Psalter_. The hymnal represented\r\nan extraordinarily high standard, both as to words and music, but it\r\nnever became popular, and copies of it are nearly impossible to find.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune, UNTER LILIEN JENER FREUDEN, is found at No. 546 of\r\nthe _Gesangbuch mit Noten_ where it is set to a poem by J. Allendorf. No\r\ninformation has been traced concerning the composer, J. Voigtländer.\r\n\r\n\r\n33. All praise to Thee, my God this night        _Thomas Ken_, 1637-1711\r\n\r\nBased on Psalm 91:4: “He shall cover thee with his feathers; and under\r\nhis wings shalt thou trust.”\r\n\r\nThis is the “Evening Hymn,” whereas No. 25 is the “Morning Hymn” which\r\nBishop Ken wrote for the devotional use of students at Winchester\r\nCollege. His endeavor was to express in simple, fitting words the\r\nthoughts that ought to be in the minds of the boys of the school “and\r\nall other devout Christians” in the evening. The two hymns were\r\npublished in 1695 and have been growing in fame and power these two and\r\none-half centuries. Both concluded with the doxology, “Praise God from\r\nwhom all blessings flow,” now known and sung throughout Christendom.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune, EVENING HYMN, was originally in canon form, i.e., a\r\nform in which one voice begins the melody which is then imitated note\r\nfor note by some other voice, as in a “round.” Tallis, as was customary\r\nat the time, started the melody in the tenor, imitated by the soprano.\r\nThe tune used here is a later and altered form which, in the judgment of\r\nthis writer, is less interesting than the canonic form used in many\r\nhymnbooks. Its choice was an editorial inadvertence.\r\n\r\nThomas Tallis, composer of the tune, died in 1585. The exact date of his\r\nbirth, probably before 1520, remains uncertain. Styled the “Father of\r\nEnglish Cathedral Music,” he was chorister at St. Paul’s Cathedral,\r\nLondon, and later held important posts as organist. He was indisputably\r\nthe greatest English musician of his age, and EVENING HYMN is his most\r\nfamous tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n34. O Gladsome Light, O Grace                  _Greek 1st or 2d Century_\r\n                                         _Tr. Robert Bridges,_ 1844-1930\r\n\r\nThis is the oldest Christian hymn in common use, belonging to the first\r\nor second century. It was sung by the early Christians as a hymn of\r\nthanksgiving at the lighting of the candles at the vesper services in\r\nthe church and probably also in the home. It is still so used in the\r\nEastern churches. St. Basil wrote c. 370 regarding this hymn: “We cannot\r\nsay who is the father of this expression at the Thanksgiving of the\r\nLighting of the Lamps; but it is an _ancient_ formula which the people\r\nrepeat.” So in A.D. 370 the hymn was already ancient!\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, Robert Bridges, see Hymn 32.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune NUNC DIMITTIS is by the French musician, Louis\r\nBourgeois, c. 1510-61, the best melodist of his day, and composer of\r\nmost of the music for the _Genevan Psalter_, a French metrical version\r\nof the Psalms published in 1549. Many of his melodies have been altered,\r\nas for example, “Old Hundredth,” but this one has come to us unchanged.\r\nIt is a glorious melody which needs to be listened to repeatedly to be\r\nappreciated. The harmonization is by Claude Goudimel, c. 1505/10-72,\r\nanother eminent Protestant musician, who provided harmonies for many of\r\nthe Genevan psalm tunes. Goudimel’s life came to an end in the massacre\r\nof St. Bartholomew in 1572, one of those tragedies during the\r\ncounter-reformation in which the Protestants suffered at the hands of\r\nthe Jesuits.\r\n\r\n\r\n35. God that madest earth and heaven         _Stanza 1, Reginald Heber_,\r\n                                                               1783-1826\r\n                                     _Stanza 2, William Mercer_, 1811-73\r\n                                 _Stanza 3, Richard Whateley_, 1787-1863\r\n\r\nThe original hymn consisted of the first stanza only which was written\r\nby Reginald Heber after hearing the tune used here played by a Welch\r\nharpist in a home where Heber was visiting. Retiring to a quiet place,\r\nhe promptly wrote the stanza to suit the melody.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Reginald Heber see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\nWilliam Mercer, author of the second stanza, was a clergyman in the\r\nChurch of England in Sheffield. In 1857, he issued _The Church Psalter\r\nand Hymn Book_, the most important Church of England book of its time.\r\nHis aim was to promote greater participation by the congregation in the\r\nhymn singing.\r\n\r\nRichard Whately was archbishop of Dublin. He was a man of great\r\nbrilliance of mind, though, it is said, he had no ear for music and no\r\neye for natural beauty.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune AR HYD Y NOS is a Welsh traditional melody commonly\r\nassociated with the words “All through the night.” It appears in many\r\nmodern hymnals. A growing number of folk tunes are being used for hymn\r\ntunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n36. Softly now the light of day     _George Washington Doane_, 1799-1859\r\n\r\nAn American hymn characterized by simplicity and grace, and sung the\r\nworld over wherever the English language is spoken. It appeared in 1824\r\nin a collection of poems, _Songs by the Way_, with the heading\r\n“Evening.” It is based on Psalm 141:2, “Let my prayer be set forth\r\nbefore Thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening\r\nsacrifice.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington Doane was born in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1799, the\r\nyear that the “Father of our Country” died; hence his name. He was\r\neducated at Union College, Schenectady, New York, and ordained, at the\r\nage of 22, in the Episcopal Church. At the early age of 33 he was made\r\nbishop of New Jersey. A pioneer in education, and ahead of his time in\r\nmany things, his life was full of trials. But his exceptional talents,\r\nlearning and force of character made him one of the great church leaders\r\nof his time.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SEYMOUR is by the eminent German composer of opera, Carl M. von\r\nWeber, 1786-1826. This tune, a great favorite, is from the opening\r\nchorus of his opera, _Oberon_, which is sung while fairies “trip it\r\nlightly” on the stage. When contributions towards the musical edition of\r\nthe famous English book, _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, London, 1861, were\r\ninvited by advertisement, the editor, W. H. Monk, received more requests\r\nfor the insertion of this tune than any other, despite its secular\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n\r\n37. At even, when the sun was set              _Henry Twells_, 1823-1900\r\n\r\nThis evening hymn, a prayer for the healing of our bodily as well as\r\nspiritual ills, has been translated into many foreign tongues, and is\r\nfound in nearly all standard hymn books both in America and abroad. The\r\noriginal has eight stanzas. It is based on the touching evening scene\r\ndescribed in Mark 1:32, “At even, when the sun was set, they brought\r\nunto him all that were sick.”\r\n\r\nHenry Twells was ordained in 1849 in the Church of England. Among the\r\nparishes he served was Stratford-on-Avon, the birthplace of Shakespeare.\r\nAt the time he wrote this hymn, he was headmaster of a large grammar\r\nschool and penned the verses one afternoon while the boys were writing\r\nan examination.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune, ANGELUS, appeared in somewhat different form in\r\n_Heilige Seelenlust_, one of a series of Catholic collections of hymns\r\nin Germany, written in the vernacular, and edited by Johann Scheffler.\r\nThe tune is credited to Georg Josephi, a German musician of whom little\r\nis known except that he was the musical editor of _Heilige Seelenlust_.\r\nIt is a tune of rare beauty though its modulations into several\r\ndifferent keys makes it more difficult to sing than some and gives it a\r\nsense of restlessness not found in other popular tunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n38. Savior, breathe an evening blessing      _James Edmeston_, 1791-1867\r\n\r\nThis hymn ranks with the best of the evening hymns of the English\r\nlanguage though it is practically all that survives of the more than two\r\nthousand hymns that came from the too prolific pen of the author.\r\n\r\nJames Edmeston, a member of the Church of England, was an eminent London\r\narchitect and surveyor who had a great love for and interest in children\r\nand possessed a gift for writing sacred poetry. He had the habit of\r\nwriting a hymn every Sunday and reading it at family worship.\r\n\r\nDuring the Boxer uprising in China in 1900, in which many Americans lost\r\ntheir lives, a group of missionaries, beleaguered outside of Shanghai,\r\nfound in this hymn the expression of their feelings, as well as a great\r\nsource of comfort. One of them wrote:\r\n\r\n  Separated from home and friends, facing death in a far-off land, and\r\n  full of tenderest feelings, we lifted our hearts in song:\r\n\r\n  “Though destruction walk around us,\r\n    Though the arrows past us fly:\r\n  Angel guards from Thee surround us;\r\n    We are safe if Thou art nigh.”\r\n\r\n  Out of the storm each soul, renewing its strength, mounted up with\r\n  wings as eagles and found peace in the secret of His presence. Our\r\n  Saviour breathed, in very deed, “an evening blessing,” the fragrance\r\n  of which remains even unto this day. The last verse of the hymn,\r\n  “Should swift death this night o’ertake us,” was omitted. It seemed\r\n  too probable that it might. We wanted only to think of the\r\n  safe-keeping, and such, thank God, it proved to be.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune EVENING PRAYER was written by Stebbins while music\r\ndirector at Tremont Temple, Boston, as a response to be sung after the\r\nmorning prayer. Two years later it was set to this evening hymn by the\r\ncomposer himself, for use in an evangelistic campaign in Providence, R.\r\nI. Stebbins writes, “I arranged to have a male choir of 20 voices sing\r\nthe music as set to the beautiful hymn, and to my gratification found\r\nthey were admirably suited to each other. Since then the hymn has been\r\nused in many gospel hymn books and church hymnals, both here and abroad.\r\nIt has been used also in St. Paul’s Cathedral, in London.”\r\n\r\nGeorge C. Stebbins, 1846-1945, was born and reared on a farm in New\r\nYork. He became interested in music through the country singing school.\r\nAfter serving as music director at the First Baptist Church, Chicago,\r\nand Tremont Temple, Boston, he became associated with D. L. Moody and\r\nhelped organize choruses for many of Moody’s evangelistic campaigns both\r\nhere and abroad. He was co-editor with Ira Sankey and James McGranahan\r\nof various editions of _Gospel Hymns_ and was himself one of the best\r\ncomposers of gospel hymn tunes. He lived to be nearly 100 years old.\r\n\r\nThe hymn is also set to the tune “Ringe Recht” (147) in some hymnals.\r\n\r\n\r\n39. Unheard the dews around me fall                          _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nThis hymn, emphasizing the silences of God as manifested in the world\r\nwithout and within, is of anonymous authorship. It is found in _Hymns of\r\nthe Spirit_ but most of the other modern hymnals have overlooked it.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WINDSOR is an English tune of unknown origin. It was set to\r\nPsalm 116 in a book of Psalm tunes by M. William Damon, published in\r\n1591. It is one of a number of tunes written in the minor mode which\r\nappear in the _Hymnary_. Note that the “Amen” closes with the chord in F\r\nmajor, in keeping with the general practice of following a minor tune\r\nwith an “Amen” in which the last chord is in the major mode.\r\n\r\nIn _Songs of Praise_, London, 1931, this tune is set to the hymn “Jesus,\r\nthe very thought of Thee” (155).\r\n\r\n\r\n40. Abide with me; fast falls the eventide    _Henry F. Lyte,_ 1793-1847\r\n\r\nOne of the great consolation songs of Christianity. It is really not an\r\nevening hymn, but for a person in his last illness, when the thought of\r\npassing through the gateway of death, and the glory of the great beyond\r\nare the soul’s vital concern. It has long been sung at evening services\r\nbecause, presumably, the end of the natural day suggests the evening of\r\nlife, and the mood of the tune is so well suited to the pensive\r\nquietness of the close of day.\r\n\r\nHenry F. Lyte, a Scotsman, was a young clergyman in the Church of\r\nEngland when he wrote this hymn. There is a popular tradition that he\r\nwrote it near the end of his life when ill health compelled him to\r\nresign his parish and after he held his last communion on September 4,\r\n1847. But James Moffatt, the distinguished historian and translator of\r\nthe Bible, gives a different account of its origin. He says the hymn was\r\ninspired during the fatal illness of an intimate friend of the author,\r\nRev. William A. Le Hunte. Dr. Lyte was constantly at the side of his\r\ndying friend who, in his closing hours, repeatedly said these words,\r\n“Abide with me,” which moved Dr. Lyte to write the hymn. Twenty-seven\r\nyears later, 1847, when he felt his own end approaching, he recalled the\r\nhymn.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EVENTIDE is Monk’s best known tune. In a letter to J. C.\r\nHadden, Mrs. Monk wrote: “This tune was written at a time of great\r\nsorrow—when together we watched, as we did daily, the glories of the\r\nsetting sun. As the golden rays faded, he took up some paper and\r\npencilled that tune which has gone over all the world.” The composition\r\nis said to have been completed in ten minutes. It was the last hymn sung\r\nby the Canadian nurse Edith Cavell before she suffered martyrdom in\r\nBelgium, October 12, 1915.\r\n\r\nWm. H. Monk, 1823-89, English organist and composer, devoted his life to\r\nthe service of church music. For forty years he held the post of\r\norganist at King’s College, London, and St. Matthias, Stoke Newington,\r\ndevoting himself to the advancement of good congregational singing. “He\r\ntaught many to praise God who had never praised Him before; he taught\r\nothers to praise Him more worthily than hitherto.” He was the music\r\neditor of the famous _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, published in England,\r\n1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CLOSE OF WORSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\n41. Blest be the tie that binds                _John Fawcett_, 1740-1817\r\n\r\nThis hymn is often sung at the close of church meetings. Sometimes the\r\ncustom of the people joining hands while singing is observed.\r\n\r\nJohn Fawcett, an English Baptist minister, was serving a small country\r\nchurch in Yorkshire when he received and accepted a call to a large city\r\nchurch in London, which paid a salary more suited to the needs of his\r\nbig family. His farewell sermon had been preached, six or seven wagons\r\nstood loaded with his furniture and books, and all was ready for his\r\ndeparture. But when the members of his humble flock turned out to bid\r\nfarewell, many of them in tears, and imploring him to stay, it was more\r\nthan he or Mrs. Fawcett could stand. He ordered the wagons unloaded and\r\nthe furniture put back in its place, and sent a message to the London\r\nchurch that he was not coming. Afterwards he wrote this hymn which was\r\nto become one of the most famous in the English language.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DENNIS is simple and easy of performance, yet pleasing and\r\neffective. The tune was composed by Hans Georg Nägeli, 1768-1836, a\r\nSwiss, who was born near Zurich where he spent most of his life as music\r\npublisher, composer, and teacher. He was a prominent figure in public\r\nschool music and was greatly interested in church music.\r\n\r\nLowell Mason found this melody in manuscript form and arranged it for\r\nuse as a church tune.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Lowell Mason see Hymn 12. The tune “Boylston” (214) is\r\nalso used with this hymn.\r\n\r\n\r\n42. The Lord be with us as we bend              _John Ellerton_, 1826-93\r\n\r\nThe hymn is particularly appropriate for the close of an evening\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nJohn Ellerton was a minister of the Church of England, a teacher,\r\nauthor, and one of England’s most distinguished hymnists. He assisted in\r\nediting the famous _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, London, 1861. He was\r\nearly surrounded with religious influences and had a happy childhood\r\nlife. Of his parents he wrote, “I used to feel how happy my father and\r\nmother were, even more than how good they were.” He composed about fifty\r\nhymns and made about ten translations, a large proportion of which have\r\nfound their way into church hymnals. He refused to take out a copyright\r\nfor any of his hymns, saying that “if any are counted worthy to\r\ncontribute to Christ’s praise in the congregation, one ought to feel\r\nvery thankful and humble.” His hymns, of which there are eight in the\r\n_Hymnary_, are elevated in tone and devotional spirit.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BEATITUDO was written for the Revised Edition of _Hymns Ancient\r\nand Modern_, 1875, and was set to the words, “How bright these glorious\r\nspirits shine.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, J. B. Dykes, see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n43. Savior, again to Thy dear Name we raise     _John Ellerton_, 1826-93\r\n\r\nThis, the most popular of Ellerton’s hymns, was originally written in\r\n1866 for a choir festival. It was revised and condensed to these four\r\nverses, rich in poetic beauty and spiritual power, to take a high place\r\namong our evening hymns. The first stanza may be used with good effect\r\nas a choral benediction. The last stanza was sung at Ellerton’s funeral\r\non June 20, 1893.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Ellerton see Hymn 42.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ELLERS was composed for this hymn in 1869.\r\n\r\nEdward John Hopkins, 1818-1901, was a distinguished English church\r\nmusician who served as organist in several important London churches,\r\nincluding Westminster Abbey. He was a prolific composer of church music\r\nof fine quality—services, hymn-tunes, anthems, organ pieces—and enjoyed\r\na great reputation as editor of hymn books.\r\n\r\n\r\n44. O Savior, bless us ere we go           _Frederick W. Faber_, 1814-63\r\n\r\nA hymn for the close of evening worship.\r\n\r\nFrederick W. Faber was educated at Oxford and became a minister in the\r\nChurch of England. He began his parish work at Elton where he became a\r\nforceful preacher and was known for his fine Christian character and\r\nlovely spirit. Church attendance increased, the parish grew, and the\r\npeople who had been known for their intemperance and immorality were now\r\nreputed for their thrift and good behavior.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of John Henry Newman, Faber changed his views and\r\njoined the Roman Catholic Church. After a trip to Rome, he lived at\r\nBirmingham where he formed, with eight others, a community called\r\n“Brothers of the Will of God.” Later he moved to London where he\r\ncontinued his service in the Catholic Church until his death at the age\r\nof forty-nine. He wrote many theological and devotional books but is\r\nbest known for his hymns of which he wrote 150, among which are such\r\nfavorites as “There’s a wideness in God’s mercy” (58) and “Faith of our\r\nfathers” (154). His hymns are numbered among the treasures of English\r\nhymnody. They are devotional in spirit and with slight alterations\r\nappropriate for use in all Christian churches.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SURREY is a beautiful tune which became immediately popular and\r\nhas remained so, especially in England. The composer, Henry Carey,\r\n1692-1743, was a teacher in boarding schools and private families in\r\nEngland. He composed a large number of secular songs and was only\r\nincidentally a writer of church music.\r\n\r\n\r\n45. Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing         _John Fawcett_, 1740-1817\r\n\r\nThis popular dismission hymn is ascribed to the English Baptist\r\nminister, John Fawcett, who is best known as the author of “Blest be the\r\ntie that binds.” The hymn has undergone some alteration with the passing\r\nof the years. The third stanza originally read:\r\n\r\n  “So whene’er the signal’s given\r\n    “Us from earth to call away,\r\n  “Borne on angels’ wings to heaven\r\n    “Glad the summons to obey,\r\n      “May we ever\r\n  “Reign with Christ in endless day.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Fawcett see Hymn 41.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SICILIAN MARINERS is a familiar tune of unknown origin which\r\nhas been set to various hymns, including the Latin “_O Sanctissima, O\r\nPurissima_,” and the German “_O du fröliche, o du selige_.” The tune,\r\nsometimes called “Sicily,” is not known in Sicily today.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  GOD THE FATHER—HIS MAJESTY AND POWER\r\n\r\n\r\n46. Mighty God, while angels bless Thee       _Robert Robinson_, 1735-90\r\n\r\nThe author of this hymn had a unique career. Robert Robinson, born in\r\nNorfolk, England, of lowly parentage, was left fatherless at eight to be\r\nthe sole support of his widowed mother. At fourteen he was apprenticed\r\nto a barber in London who frequently reprimanded him for giving too much\r\ntime to the reading of books and too little to business. At seventeen he\r\nheard the great evangelist Whitefield preach a sermon on Matthew 3:7 and\r\ndecided to dedicate his life to God. His complete conversion he dates a\r\nfew years later, 1755. He began preaching under the Methodists but soon\r\ndeveloped independent views and in 1759 he received adult baptism and\r\nunited with the Baptists. Shortly afterwards he became the pastor of a\r\nsmall Baptist church in the university town of Cambridge. He was a\r\ngifted scholar, and though he had little formal education, he held the\r\nrespect of Cambridge students, notwithstanding the taunts of university\r\nprofessors. Serving a small and poor congregation and being without\r\nfinances to support his large family, he helped himself by engaging in\r\nfarming and carrying on business as a coal and corn merchant while\r\npreaching twice a Sunday and holding evangelistic meetings during the\r\nweek. In this he succeeded in a very remarkable measure, aided by the\r\nfact that he knew the soil and the tillers of the soil and was gifted\r\nwith the sense of humor and a Spurgeon-like wit. Besides this hymn, he\r\nalso wrote the well-known hymn, “Come, Thou fount of every blessing”\r\n(189).\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CRUCIFER, originally known as “Bethany,” was composed by Henry\r\nSmart for “Jesus, I my cross have taken.” The composer favored unison\r\nsinging of this melody, at moderate tempo. Most congregations will find\r\nthe pitch range in the melody too wide for best results in unison\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\nHenry Smart, 1813-1879, turned from the legal profession to devote his\r\nlife to music. Though largely self-taught, he became one of England’s\r\ndistinguished organists and builder of organs. He suffered from poor\r\neyesight and the last fourteen years of his life he was totally blind,\r\nbut he kept on playing and composing for he had a very retentive memory\r\nand possessed a rare skill in extempore playing. Smart was a strong\r\nadvocate of congregational singing, but favored the unison singing of\r\nmelodies, and had a decided prejudice against what he considered unduly\r\nfast congregational singing.\r\n\r\n\r\n47. I sing the mighty power of God              _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nA hymn of praise, magnifying the power, wisdom, goodness, and\r\nomnipresence of God as revealed in creation. It appeared first in Watt’s\r\n_Divine and Moral Songs for the Use of Children_ where it was entitled,\r\n“Praise for Creation and Providence.” The original has eight stanzas.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Watts see No. 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ELLACOMBE is a cheerful, unpretentious tune that deserves to be\r\nbetter known. The source designated is _Gesangbuch der Herzogl_\r\npublished in 1784, but some of our best authorities are content to leave\r\nits exact origin in doubt. It found its way into English hymnals soon\r\nafter it was published in _Vollständige Sammlung der gewöhnlichen\r\nMelodien zum Mainzer Gesangbuche_, by X. L. Hartig, in 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MAKER OF HEAVEN AND EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\n48. This is my Father’s world            _Maltbie D. Babcock_, 1858-1901\r\n\r\nThe original has sixteen stanzas, each beginning with the words “This is\r\nmy Father’s world,” a good slogan to begin and end the day. It appeared\r\nin the author’s _Thoughts for Every Day Living_, a book of religious\r\nverse. The hymn expresses a confident attitude toward life and a buoyant\r\nfaith in God.\r\n\r\nMaltbie D. Babcock, prominent Presbyterian minister, was born in\r\nSyracuse, New York, graduated from Syracuse University and Auburn\r\nSeminary and then began his first pastorate at the First Presbyterian\r\nChurch, Lockport, N. Y. His second pastorate was at Brown Memorial\r\nChurch, Baltimore, where he was popular with the students at Johns\r\nHopkins University. He then received a call to the Brick Church, New\r\nYork City, where he became the successor of Henry van Dyke. In his\r\nstudent days he was known as a fine student, a great athlete, a good\r\nmusician, and a friend to all. He loved young people and during his\r\nministry they turned to him for counsel.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune TERRA BEATA is simple, light in movement, and easy to\r\nsing. It was composed by Franklin Sheppard, 1852-1930, a Philadelphia\r\nbusiness man, Presbyterian layman, and friend of Dr. Babcock. Sheppard\r\nwas also an accomplished musician. He modestly attributed the tune to an\r\nold English folk melody, but it is known now that he himself was the\r\ncomposer. He named the tune “Terra Beata,” happy or blessed earth.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement in the _Hymnary_, known as “Terra Patris,” is by Edward\r\nShippen Barnes, a contemporary American organist and composer. His\r\nharmonization is a little more difficult to sing but also more\r\ninteresting than the original by Sheppard.\r\n\r\n\r\n49. Let the whole creation cry           _Stopford A. Brooke_, 1832-1916\r\n\r\nThe hymn is an imitation of Psalm 148. It is a universal call to praise\r\nrather than an expression of praise, hence it is addressed not to God\r\nbut to his creation everywhere, as a call to worship God. The hymn is\r\ncharacterized by literary grace, simplicity, and tenderness, and is\r\nincluded in many modern hymnals.\r\n\r\nStopford A. Brooke, born in Ireland, was educated at Dublin, then became\r\na clergyman in the Anglican Church. For a time he was one of the most\r\npopular preachers in London. In 1880, being restive under the doctrinal\r\nstandards of the church, he severed his relation with the Anglicans and\r\ncontinued a ministry of preaching and lecturing and writing as an\r\nindependent, not associated with any denomination. His _Life and Letters\r\nof F. W. Robertson_ ranks among the classic biographies. In 1881, he\r\ncompiled _Christian Hymns_ for use in his own congregation, in which\r\nthis hymn is found, the original having ten stanzas.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ROLAND is an easy, flowing tune which congregations love to\r\nsing after learning it well. It is suitable for use as a processional.\r\nThe composer, Caleb Simmer, born 1856, was an American musician. His\r\nsacred pieces include anthems, quartets, cantatas, and organ music.\r\n\r\n\r\n50. The spacious firmament on high           _Joseph Addison_, 1672-1719\r\n\r\nThis hymn was praised by Lord Selbourne as “a very perfect and finished\r\ncomposition, taking rank among the best hymns of the English language.”\r\nThe author, Joseph Addison, was an eminent Englishman of letters. Dr.\r\nSamuel Johnson said of him, “Whoever wishes to attain an English style,\r\nfamiliar, but not coarse, elegant but not ostentatious, must give his\r\ndays and nights to the volumes of Addison.” In 1712, Addison wrote a\r\nseries of essays in the _Spectator_, concluding each essay with a hymn.\r\nIn the issue of August 23, this hymn, a free rendering of Psalm 19,\r\nformed the conclusion to an essay on “The Proper Means of Strengthening\r\nand Confirming Faith in the Mind of Man.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CREATION is an adaptation of a part of the magnificent chorus\r\n(No. 14) in Haydn’s oratorio, _The Creation_. For comments on Haydn, see\r\nHymn No. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n51. For the beauty of the earth       _Folliott S. Pierpoint_, 1835-1917\r\n\r\nThis delightful hymn of thanksgiving was originally written for the\r\ncommunion service to bring the note of joy into the solemn sacrament,\r\nmaking it truly an “eucharist.” It is now used frequently at\r\nThanksgiving and children’s services. It names many causes for praise\r\nand thanksgiving, from the “beauty of the earth” to the “church that\r\nlifteth holy hands.”\r\n\r\nThe author, Folliott S. Pierpoint, was born at Bath, England, and\r\neducated at Cambridge. He was a teacher of the classics, published\r\nseveral books of poems, and made notable contributions to the hymnody of\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DIX appeared first in a collection of chorales edited and\r\npublished by Kocher in Stuttgart in 1838, set to the hymn “_Treuer\r\nHeiland, wir sind hier_.” It has long been used with the words, “As with\r\ngladness men of old” (530), by W. C. Dix, hence the name “Dix.” It has a\r\nstrong, joyous tune which marches with stately tread and is a favorite\r\nprocessional.\r\n\r\nConrad Kocher, 1786-1872, was a German student of church music, a\r\ncomposer and teacher. He studied at St. Petersburg and in Rome. He\r\nfounded the School of Sacred Song in Stuttgart, which did much to\r\nimprove German church music and popularize four-part singing in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n52. God of the earth, the sky, the sea      _Samuel Longfellow_, 1819-92\r\n\r\nA hymn which finds God in every aspect of nature. For comments on the\r\nauthor, Samuel Longfellow, see Hymn 28.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SHELTERING WING, a long-meter melody admirably suited to these\r\nwords, is by the English church musician, Joseph Barnby, 1838-96. For\r\ncomments on him see Hymn 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n53. Lord of all being, throned afar          _Oliver W. Holmes_, 1809-94\r\n\r\nA hymn difficult to praise too highly, probably the greatest penned on\r\nthe omnipresence of God. Its first appearance was in the _Atlantic\r\nMonthly_ as the final installment of the series of articles later\r\ncollected into book form and entitled _The Professor at the Breakfast\r\nTable_. The work closed with the following lines and the hymn:\r\n\r\n  Peace to all such as may have been vexed in spirit by any utterances\r\n  these pages may have repeated! They will, doubtless, forget for the\r\n  moment the differences in the hues of truth we look at through our\r\n  human prisms and join in singing (inwardly) this hymn to the Source of\r\n  the light we all need to lead us, and the warmth which alone can make\r\n  us brothers:\r\n\r\n  Lord of all being! throned afar,\r\n    Thy glory flames from sun and star;\r\n  Centre and soul of every sphere,\r\n    Yet to each loving heart how near.\r\n\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes was the son of a Congregational minister in\r\nCambridge, Massachusetts, although later when he became established as a\r\nphysician in Boston, he united with the Unitarians. His writings are\r\nnevertheless permeated by an evangelical warmth which has made his hymns\r\nacceptable to all denominations. Holmes was a distinguished graduate of\r\nHarvard University in Arts and Medicine and spent most of his years\r\nteaching anatomy at Harvard. But he is best known to us as a man of\r\nletters. None of his writings is so widely known as the two hymns, “Lord\r\nof all being” and “O Love divine, that stooped to share” (172), both of\r\nthem found in the author’s _The Professor at the Breakfast Table_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LOUVAN is by an American musician, Virgil C. Taylor, 1817-91,\r\norganist and editor of song books. This is the only one of his tunes now\r\nin common use. An alternative tune that fits the hymn very well is “St.\r\nCrispin” found at No. 149.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HIS LOVE AND MERCY\r\n\r\n\r\n54. Be still, my soul, the Lord is on thy side            _Katharina von\r\n                                                 Schlegel, born c._ 1697\r\n                                        _Tr. Jane L. Borthwick_, 1813-97\r\n\r\nThe hymn is a translation of a poem by Katharina von Schlegel. She was\r\nborn in Germany, 1697. No one seems to have found anything definite\r\nconcerning her life, except that she wrote some hymns, one of which\r\npassed into the English language. The original, based on Psalm 46:10,\r\n“Be still and know that I am God,” had four stanzas, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Stille, mein Wille! Dein Jesus hilft siegen;\r\n    Trage geduldig das Leiden, die Not;\r\n  Gott ist’s, der alles zum besten will fügen,\r\n    Der dir getreu bleibt in Schmerzen und Tod.\r\n  Stille, mein Wille! Dein Jesus wird machen\r\n  Glücklichen Ausgang bedenklicher Sachen.\r\n\r\n  Stille, mein Wille! Der Herr hat’s in Händen;\r\n    Hält sich dein Herz nur im Glauben an ihn,\r\n  Wird er den Kummer bald wenden und enden\r\n    Herrlich wird endlich, was wunderbar schien.\r\n  Stille, mein Wille! Dein Heiland wird zeigen,\r\n  Wie vor ihm Meer und Gewitter muss schweigen.\r\n\r\n  Stille, mein Wille! Wenn Freunde sich trennen,\r\n    Die du so zärtlich und innig geliebt,\r\n  Wirst du die Freundschaft des Höchsten erkennen,\r\n    Der sich zum Eigentum treulich dir gibt.\r\n  Stille, mein Wille! Dein Jesus ersetzet,\r\n  Was dich beim Sterben der Liebsten verletzet.\r\n\r\n  Stille, mein Wille! Es kommen die Stunden,\r\n    Dass wir beim Herrn sind ohn’ Wechsel der Zeit;\r\n  Dann ist das Scheiden, der Kummer verschwunden.\r\n    Ewige Freundschaft vergütet das Leid.\r\n  Stille, mein Wille! Nach zeitlichem Scheiden\r\n  Sehn wir uns wieder ohn’ Schmerzen und Leiden.\r\n\r\nThe words, both in the original and in the English translation, are of\r\ngreat beauty and their message has brought real comfort to many a\r\nburdened and disquieted soul.\r\n\r\nThe translation is by Jane Borthwick, born in Edinburgh, who, with her\r\nsister, Sarah B. Findlater, did outstanding work as a translator of\r\nGerman hymns. Only Catherine Winkworth surpassed her. Miss Borthwick, a\r\nmember of the Free Church of Scotland, was a devout Christian character,\r\nespecially interested in the mission work of the church, both home and\r\nforeign. Another of her well-known translations is “My Jesus, as Thou\r\nwilt” (250) from the original by Benjamin Schmolke.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FINLANDIA is from the pen of Jean Sibelius, born December 8,\r\n1865, in Finland, and undoubtedly the greatest living composer. At this\r\nwriting, 1948, he is still living, but, through the misfortunes of war,\r\nreduced to penury and poverty. Besides seven symphonies, he wrote many\r\nsmaller orchestral works. This tune is from the tone poem “Finlandia,”\r\nthe arrangement having been made for the _Hymnal of the Presbyterian\r\nChurch_ in 1932. It is included in a number of recent hymn books and has\r\nbecome a favorite with worshipping congregations wherever introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n55. God is love; His mercy brightens           _John Bowring_, 1792-1872\r\n\r\nA bright, joyful hymn which we owe to a layman, Sir John Bowring, born\r\nat Exeter, England, 1792. Though a member of the Unitarian Church, his\r\nfaith was apparently that of an evangelical. On his tombstone are\r\nengraved the words of another great hymn which he himself wrote, “In the\r\nCross of Christ I glory” (See 110). Bowring was the son of a\r\nmanufacturer of woolen goods and he spent his early years travelling in\r\nall parts of the world in the interest of his father’s business. Though\r\nhe left school at the age of 14, he became an outstanding linguist and\r\nscholar and writer. At the age of 16, he had acquired five languages and\r\nlate in life he is said to have known 200 languages and spoken 100. One\r\nof his primary interests was politics. He was elected to the British\r\nParliament and later became the British consul at Canton and the\r\ngovernor of Hong Kong. He published a book of _Hymns_ with the desire\r\nthat they might be useful in strengthening the religious faith of others\r\nwho under suffering and disheartening circumstances might chance to read\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe hymn is constructed to emphasize in each stanza the idea of God as\r\nwisdom (I Cor. 1:30) and love (I John 4:8).\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ STOCKWELL, a very useful tune, appeared in Lowell Mason’s\r\npopular collection of hymns, _New Carmina Sacra_, in 1850, set to the\r\nwords, “Silently the shades of evening,” written by Christopher Cox.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Darius Eliot Jones, 1815-81, was born at Carroll, N. Y.\r\nHis father, Abner Jones, was a well-known music teacher in New York.\r\nDarius spent twenty years of his adult life in business. He served for a\r\ntime as assistant editor of the _Choral Advocate_, published by Mason\r\nBrothers, New York, and at the same time conducted the music in Plymouth\r\nChurch, Brooklyn, where Henry Ward Beecher was pastor. At Beecher’s\r\nsuggestion, Jones prepared a new hymn book, _Temple Melodies_, 1861, for\r\nuse in Plymouth Church. Feeling a call to the Christian ministry, Jones\r\nentered Iowa College, at Davenport, as a student and at the age of 43\r\nwas ordained as a Congregational minister. He served churches at\r\nColumbia City and Newton Center, Ia., until 1863, when he became\r\ntreasurer of the Iowa General Association. For a year, he was agent for\r\nthe American Bible Society; and for four years, 1866-70, he was agent\r\nfor Iowa College, later located at Grinnell and known as Grinnell\r\nCollege. Here Jones published a second hymn book, _Songs for the New\r\nLife_, in 1869. From that time on, he served various churches in Iowa\r\nuntil his death in 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n56. How gentle God’s commands                _Philip Doddridge_, 1702-51\r\n\r\nThis hymn, beautiful in poetic imagery, is based on I Peter 5:7,\r\n“Casting all your care upon Him: for He careth for you.” When it first\r\nappeared, posthumously, in a book of hymns by the author, it bore the\r\ntitle, “God’s care a remedy for ours.”\r\n\r\nPhilip Doddridge was born in London, the youngest of a family of twenty,\r\nmost of whom died in childhood. His father was an oil merchant. Before\r\nhe could read, he had learned from his mother the stories of the Bible\r\nby the aid of Bible pictures on the Dutch tiles that covered a portion\r\nof the living room. Doddridge became a minister in the Congregational\r\nChurch and devoted his life not only to preaching, but to writing books\r\nand teaching young men for the ministry. In 1751, he went to Lisbon to\r\nseek relief from tuberculosis but died there. He is the author of over\r\n400 hymns, a few of which have survived, and are found in most hymn\r\nbooks. The _Hymnary_ contains six of his compositions.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DENNIS. For comments on this tune see Hymn 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n57. Thou Grace Divine, encircling all           _Eliza Scudder_, 1821-96\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written by Eliza Scudder, an American hymn writer of the\r\nmiddle nineteenth century. She was born in Boston, and died in Weston,\r\nMassachusetts. She was a niece of Edmund H. Sears, author of “It came\r\nupon a midnight clear” (No. 75). Miss Scudder was a person of deep\r\nreligious insight and lived a quiet, retiring life. She published a book\r\nof religious verse, _Hymns and Sonnets_, in 1880. During most of her\r\nactive life she was a Unitarian, but in later life joined the Episcopal\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BALLERMA (misspelled Balerma in some editions of the _Hymnary_)\r\nis a very simple tune, the second pair of lines varying only slightly\r\nfrom the first pair. The origin of the tune is uncertain. It is thought\r\nto be an old Spanish melody, arranged by F. H. Barthélémon.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Barthélémon see Hymn 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n58. There’s a wideness in God’s mercy             _F. W. Faber_, 1814-63\r\n\r\nThe original of this poem has thirteen stanzas, the first of which\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n  Souls of men! why will ye scatter\r\n    Like a crowd of frightened sheep?\r\n  Foolish hearts! why will ye wander\r\n    From a love so true and deep?\r\n\r\nThe five stanzas selected for use here make an impressive and coherent\r\nhymn with no trace of the author’s strong Roman Catholic bias which\r\ncharacterizes nearly all of his hymns.\r\n\r\nFor comments on F. W. Faber see Hymn 44.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WELLESLEY was written, by request, for the graduation hymn of\r\nthe Newton (Mass.) high school class of which Miss Tourjee was then a\r\nmember. The original tune had a slight fault in voice leading which was\r\ncorrected, with her permission, by Dr. Hamilton C. Macdougall, then\r\nProfessor of Music at Wellesley College.\r\n\r\nLizzie S. Tourjee, 1858-1913, was a student at Wellesley College during\r\nthe year 1877-78. In 1883, she married Frank Estabrook. Her father, Dr.\r\nEben Tourjee, encouraged her in the writing of the tune, and named it\r\nfor the new college nearby where she became a student for one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n59. Father Almighty, bless us with Thy blessing              _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nA prayer of invocation seeking the blessing and guidance of Almighty\r\nGod. The authorship is anonymous.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ INTEGER VITAE (or FLEMMING) was composed by Flemming for a\r\nchorus of men’s voices. It was set to “Integer Vitae,” an ode by Horace.\r\nThe tune became a great favorite with college men not only in this\r\ncountry but also in England and Germany. It was introduced as a hymn\r\ntune through the hymnals of Dr. Charles R. Robinson, _Songs of the\r\nSanctuary_, and _Laudes Domine_, and has since been widely used and\r\naccepted as one of our most satisfactory hymn tunes. It is one of the\r\nfavorite tunes in the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_ where it is set to the\r\nwords, “_Ach mein Herr Jesu_.”\r\n\r\nThe composer, Frederick Ferdinand Flemming, M. D., 1778-1813, received\r\nhis training in medicine and was a successful practitioner in Berlin. He\r\nis known to posterity, however, as a composer of part songs for men’s\r\nchoruses, and more particularly as the composer of this tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n60. God moves in a mysterious way            _William Cowper_, 1731-1800\r\n\r\nThere is no basis, according to most hymnologists, for the story that\r\nthis hymn was written after Cowper was mysteriously prevented from\r\ncommitting suicide by drowning. The hymn was published by John Newton in\r\nthe _Olney Hymns_, 1779, and rapidly became popular. It is still found\r\nin nearly all the hymnals. Its original title was “Light shining out of\r\ndarkness.” Its central thought is that God is working His sovereign will\r\neven in the mystery and perplexity of human life, bringing light, not\r\n_after_ darkness, but _out of_ darkness.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cowper, 1731-1800, was the greatest English poet of his age. He\r\nhad been trained for the law and was called to the bar at the age of\r\ntwenty-three but had to retire on account of ill health. He lost his\r\nmental balance and became deeply melancholic, a misfortune which is\r\nattributed to cruelty received at the hands of older and stronger lads\r\nwhile he attended preparatory school. After treatment in a private\r\nasylum, and living for a time in the home of Rev. Morley Unwin, he moved\r\nto Olney where his devoted friend, the Rev. John Newton was curate. Here\r\nhe assisted Newton in his parochial and evangelistic work and\r\ncollaborated with him in the production of what became known as the\r\n_Olney Hymns_. In spite of efforts at literary work, his depression of\r\nspirit returned and never left him, except for brief intervals, until\r\nhis death in 1800.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DUNDEE (or FRENCH) is one of the twelve Common Tunes appearing\r\nin the _Scottish Psalter, The CL Psalms of David &_, Edinburgh, 1615,\r\nwhere it is named “French Tune.” Its first appearance in an English\r\nPsalter is in Ravencroft’s _Whole Book of Psalms_, 1621, where it is\r\ncalled “Dundy.” It is one of the best known of the psalm tunes and its\r\nsmooth, flowing melody has enjoyed great popularity.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the _Scottish Psalter_ see Hymn 575.\r\n\r\n\r\n61. O God, our help in ages past                _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nBased on Psalm 90:1-6: “Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all\r\ngenerations,” etc., this is Watt’s greatest hymn and one of the greatest\r\nin the English language. It is found in all English hymn books and has\r\nbeen translated into many languages. Its smoothness, simple dignity, and\r\nfaithfulness to Scripture give it the marks of a true church hymn, and\r\nit has probably been chosen more than any other for use upon important\r\noccasions. It is an indispensable New Year’s hymn.\r\n\r\nA press dispatch related how the hymn was used during the Second World\r\nWar by a group of eleven doomed Norwegians as they faced a Nazi firing\r\nsquad in the village of Selbu outside of Trondheim, Norway, for “general\r\nhostility” to German occupiers. “Despite the torture to which they had\r\nbeen subjected to earlier,” writes an eye-witness, “the group of\r\nprisoners, linked hand in hand, proudly and firmly faced their\r\nexecutioners. One of the men, Peter Morseth, who for years led the\r\nsinging in the local church, read a short prayer and was joined by his\r\ncompanions in singing the hymn, ‘O God our help in ages past.’ Then the\r\nshots rang out.”\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley printed the hymn in his _Collection of Psalms and Hymns_,\r\n1734, altering the opening line from “Our God, our help,” to “O God, our\r\nhelp.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. ANNE appeared anonymously, in two parts—treble and bass—in\r\n_A Supplement to the New Version of Psalms by Dr. Brady and Mr.\r\nTate. ... the sixth edition, corrected and much enlarged_, 1708, where\r\nit was set to Psalm 42. It is attributed upon good authority to William\r\nCroft, 1678-1727, who was interested in the production of the Tate and\r\nBrady _New Version_. Croft is one of the greatest names in English\r\nmusical history.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Croft, see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n62. The Lord is my Shepherd                _James Montgomery_, 1771-1854\r\n\r\nOne of the fine metrical versions that have been made of the\r\nTwenty-third Psalm. It Is found in Montgomery’s _Songs of Zion, being\r\nImitations of Psalms_, 1822. Another much-loved and widely used version\r\nof the same Psalm is that in the _Scottish Psalter_ (See 579).\r\n\r\nJames Montgomery, greatest of Moravian hymn writers, was born in\r\nAyrshire, Scotland, near the birthplace of Robert Burns. His father\r\nbecame a minister in the Moravian Church and finally went as a\r\nmissionary to the West Indies where both he and his wife died. After\r\nspending a part of his youth in precarious and doubtful ways of living,\r\nand failing in several business ventures, James became the editor of\r\n_The Sheffield Register_, a position he held with honor and distinction\r\nfor thirty-one years. He was twice imprisoned for expressing liberal\r\npolitical views in his paper. He is classed by the _literati_ as a minor\r\nEnglish poet, but in the writing of hymns he ranks with Wesley, Watts,\r\nand Doddridge. Of his 400 hymns, 100 are still in use. Eleven of his\r\nhymns are found in the _Hymnary_, exceeded in number only by those of\r\nHosmer, Wesley and Watts. All of Montgomery’s hymns show a marvelous\r\nknowledge of the Scriptures on the part of their author. He found in the\r\nPsalms an inexhaustible source of devotional material and made metrical\r\nversions of many of them.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ POLAND. The tune is unique in the _Hymnary_ in that the melody\r\nin the first three lines is found in the alto. To bring the melody out\r\nwith sufficient clearness, the altos might well be reenforced by some\r\nsopranos, or men’s voices, or both.\r\n\r\nThomas Koschat, 1845-1914, was an Austrian composer and singer. While a\r\nstudent of natural science at Vienna University he sang in the Court\r\nOpera Chorus, and soon became its leader. In 1875, Koschat organized the\r\nKärnthner Quintet which became famous for its singing of Carinthian folk\r\nsongs. He is known for his harmonization of Carinthian melodies and\r\noriginal songs in their style, for which he wrote the texts.\r\n\r\n\r\n63. Father and Friend, Thy light, thy love     _John Bowring_, 1792-1872\r\n\r\nA hymn on the omnipresence of God who reigns as Lord of life and cares\r\nfor His children.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Bowring see Hymn 55.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ILLA, a simple long-meter tune within easy compass of the\r\nvoices, is by the American composer, Lowell Mason, 1792-1872, an exact\r\ncontemporary of Bowring. Mason’s tunes were popular at first and then\r\nfor a time they were frowned upon by some of the “highbrow” musicians\r\nbut in late years are returning with new favor into the hymn books.\r\nMason’s name appears 24 times in our collection.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Mason see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n64. Let us with a gladsome mind                   _John Milton_, 1608-74\r\n\r\nThis delightful lyric is the result of John Milton’s paraphrasing of\r\nPsalm 136 when he was a boy of 15 years. The original has 26 stanzas.\r\nThe Psalm tells the story of Israel’s history, ending each verse with\r\nthe refrain, “For his mercy endureth forever.” The selections here are\r\nhis renderings of verses 1, 2, 7, and 25. The closing stanza returns to\r\nverse 1.\r\n\r\nJohn Milton, the poet, was born in London, the son of the John Milton,\r\nwho had turned from the Roman Catholic Church to become a Protestant.\r\nThe future poet went to Christ’s College, Cambridge, where he received\r\nhis B.A. in 1628 and M.A. in 1632. His short poems and paraphrases were\r\nwritten at an early age and constitute some of his best work. The second\r\nperiod of his literary career was given almost entirely to writings on\r\npolitical subjects for he lived in the day of the controversies which\r\nled to Civil War and the establishment of the Commonwealth in England.\r\nMilton joined Oliver Cromwell as his secretary for foreign tongues to\r\nthe Council of State, a position he held until the eve of the\r\nRestoration, when he barely escaped the scaffold. For years he had\r\nsuffered from poor eyesight and became totally blind in his forty-fourth\r\nyear. The third period of his life, after the Restoration of the\r\nMonarchy, was lived in close retirement. During this time he produced\r\nhis greatest writings: _Paradise Lost_, _Paradise Regained_, and _Samson\r\nAgonistes_, all of them dictated to others. He ranks second only to\r\nShakespeare among English poets. He translated 19 psalms into meter.\r\nBeing the scholar’s rather than the people’s poet, he, however, had no\r\ngreat influence on hymnology. His version of Psalm 84 is found at No.\r\n592.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ INNOCENTS appeared, anonymously, in the _Parish Choir_, 1850, a\r\npublication issued by members of the Oxford Movement in England who went\r\nby the name of “The Society for Promoting Church Music.” The “Society”\r\nlaid down the following principles for singing:\r\n\r\n1. Congregational singing should be in unison.\r\n\r\n2. The melody should be clearly marked.\r\n\r\n3. The compass should be within the natural limits of the human voice.\r\n\r\n4. Metrical psalmody should be confined to tunes in common time, as\r\nbeing more simple and solemn than triple time.\r\n\r\nAfter three years of precarious existence, 1846-49, the _Parish Choir_\r\nwas discontinued. INNOCENTS appeared at the end of Volume III amongst a\r\nnumber of old psalm tunes, appointed to be sung to a hymn for Innocents\r\nDay, hence the name. Lightwood attributes the tune to Joseph Smith, born\r\nin 1800, near Birmingham, England. Smith was not a professional musician\r\nbut very fond of music, an excellent singer, and composer of many hymn\r\ntunes and other pieces. The editor of the _Parish Choir_ altered the\r\noriginal to the present form. It made its way into _Hymns Ancient and\r\nModern_, 1861, and is now found in many modern hymn books.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD—HIS ADVENT\r\n\r\n\r\n65. Hail to the Lord’s Anointed            _James Montgomery_, 1771-1854\r\n\r\nA rendering of Psalm 72, made in 1821 for the Christmas worship of a\r\nMoravian settlement. The original has eight stanzas. Montgomery was\r\ngreatly interested in missions and this hymn, generally esteemed his\r\nfinest composition, is a good missionary hymn as well as a splendid one\r\nfor the Advent season. Dr. Adam Clarke gave it wide publicity by\r\npublishing it in his famous _Bible Commentary_, 1822, at the end of his\r\nexposition of Psalm 72, adding this note:\r\n\r\n  I need not tell the intelligent reader that he has seized the spirit,\r\n  and exhibited some of the principal beauties, of the Hebrew bard;\r\n  though (to use his own words in a letter to me) his “hand trembled to\r\n  touch the harp of Zion.” I take the liberty here to register a wish,\r\n  which I have strongly expressed to himself, that he would favor the\r\n  Church of God with a metrical version of the whole book.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare this hymn with Isaac Watts’ rendering of\r\nthe same psalm (341).\r\n\r\nFor comments on James Montgomery see Hymn 62.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WEBB, also known as “Morning Light,” was composed for a secular\r\nsong, “’Tis dawn, the lark is singing,” and first published in _Odeon: A\r\nCollection of Secular Melodies_, by G. J. Webb and Lowell Mason, 1837.\r\nIt first appeared as a hymn tune in _The Wesleyan Psalmist_, 1842, and\r\nlater it was used for the hymn “The morning Light is breaking,” in books\r\nby Mason and Webb.\r\n\r\nThe composer, George James Webb, 1803-87, a member of the Swedenborgian\r\nChurch, was born near Salisbury, England; studied theology and music;\r\ncame to the United States and became associated with Lowell Mason in\r\nediting and publishing music books. He was married to Mason’s daughter,\r\nMary. He played the organ at Old South Church, Boston, and was Professor\r\nof Secular Music in the Boston Academy of Music.\r\n\r\n\r\n66. Watchman, tell us of the night             _John Bowring_, 1792-1872\r\n\r\nAn Advent and missionary hymn, unique in that it consists of a dialog\r\n(between a watchman and a traveller). The hymn is based on Isaiah 21:11,\r\n12: “Watchman, what of the night? watchman, what of the night? The\r\nwatchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will\r\nenquire, enquire ye: return, come.” The meaning of the passage is not\r\nevident from the context. Dr. C. S. Robinson describes the setting as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  The image it presents is singularly dramatic and picturesque. The\r\n  scene is laid in the midst of the Babylonian Captivity. A lonely\r\n  watchman is represented as standing on the ramparts of some tower\r\n  along the defenses of the citadel. He seems to be anxiously looking\r\n  for the issues of the siege leveled against it. The time is midnight.\r\n  Calamity is over the land. The people are afflicted. Their enemies are\r\n  pressing them hard. That solitary sentinel sadly remains at his post,\r\n  peering into the unlit gloom, trying to discern signs of deliverance.\r\n  But the heavens are starless, and the impenetrable clouds keep rolling\r\n  on. Suddenly an unknown voice pierces the air. Whether in wailing\r\n  sorrow or in bitter taunt, is not evident; but out of the stillness\r\n  already grown oppressive breaks the question with repetitious\r\n  pertinacity: “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the\r\n  night?” The sentinel waits through a moment of surprised meditation\r\n  and then tranquilly answers: “The morning cometh and also the night;\r\n  if ye will inquire, inquire ye: return, come.” Then the dialog lapses\r\n  into silence again, and the night gathers its unbroken shadows deeper\r\n  than ever.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Bowring see Hymn 55.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WATCHMAN is by Lowell Mason who wrote the tune in 1830 in 3-4\r\ntime. He intended it as a duet between soprano and tenor, with the\r\ncongregation repeating the last line of each stanza (the reply of the\r\nwatchman). The tune also lends itself well to antiphonal singing.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Mason see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n67. O come, O come, Emmanuel              _From the Latin, 12th Century_\r\n                                  _Stanza 1, Tr. John M. Neale_, 1818-66\r\n                               _Stanzas 2, 3, Henry Sloan Coffin_, 1877—\r\n\r\n  Veni, veni, Emmanuel\r\n  captivum solve Israel,\r\n  qui gemit in exilio,\r\n  privatus Dei Filio.\r\n            Gaude, gaude; Emmanuel\r\n            nascetur pro te, Israel.\r\n\r\nThe hymn comes from the Latin, being a translation of the first of the\r\nseven greater _Antiphons_ (short anthems-verses) sung in the Roman\r\nChurch at Vespers on the seven days before Christmas. The refrain,\r\n“Rejoice, rejoice,” etc., added to the hymn during the 13th century, is\r\nthe answer to the longing for Christ expressed in each stanza.\r\n\r\nThe translation of Stanza 1 is by John M. Neale, 1818-66, a Cambridge\r\nscholar and the most noted hymnologist and liturgist of his time. He was\r\na minister and author of books on biblical and historical subjects, but\r\nhis fame rests chiefly on his translations of Greek and Latin hymns. The\r\n_Hymnary_ contains ten of his works.\r\n\r\nThe second and third stanzas were translated in 1916 by Henry Sloan\r\nCoffin, eminent Presbyterian minister, formerly of the Madison Avenue\r\nChurch in New York City, and then for many years president of Union\r\nTheological Seminary. He is a recognized leader in contemporary American\r\nchurch life.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ VENI EMMANUEL, written in the first Gregorian mode, is an\r\nadaptation by Thomas Helmore, in 1856, of a melody said to have been\r\nfound in a French manuscript in Lisbon, which has since disappeared. The\r\noriginal is believed to have been a 12th century “Kyrie.” The harmony in\r\nthe minor mode gives the tune its quaint flavor. It should be sung with\r\nspirit, in keeping with the joyful anticipation embodied in the words.\r\nIt is effective with men’s voices singing the first part in unison, then\r\nall the voices in harmony on the refrain. The tune also lends itself to\r\ninteresting effects in antiphonal singing.\r\n\r\n\r\n68. Veiled in darkness Judah lay          _Douglas LeTell Rights_, 1891—\r\n\r\nWritten in 1915, while World War I was raging in Europe and the clouds\r\nwere gathering thick over the United States. The hymn is an appeal for\r\nthe Spirit of Christ to bring peace and light to a troubled world. It\r\nwas composed while the author, a Moravian, was a student at the Divinity\r\nSchool of Harvard University. It was the custom at that institution to\r\nhave students of the School submit original compositions of hymns, one\r\nof which would be selected to be sung at the annual Christmas service of\r\nthe school. This hymn was selected for the Christmas of 1915.\r\n\r\nDouglas LeTell Rights, born in Winston-Salem, N. C., received his A. B.\r\ndegree from the University of North Carolina and then prepared for the\r\nministry at the Moravian Theological Seminary, Bethlehem, Pa., and at\r\nHarvard University. A member of the Moravian Church, anciently called\r\nthe _Unitas Fratrum_, his first pastorate was at the First Moravian\r\nChurch, Greensboro, N. C., 1916-18. In 1918-19, he was chaplain in the\r\narmy in World War I. Since 1919, he has been pastor of Trinity Moravian\r\nChurch, Winston-Salem, N. C. Rights is the author of _A Voyage Down the\r\nYadkin-Great Peedee River_, 1928, and has written numerous articles on\r\nhistorical and archaeological subjects pertaining to his native state.\r\nHis latest book is the _American Indian in North Carolina_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EBELING. For comments on the composer of this tune, Johann\r\nGeorg Ebeling, 1620-76, see Hymn 555.\r\n\r\n\r\n69. Come, Thou long-expected Jesus             _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nA dignified, yet stirring Advent hymn, based on Haggai 2:7: “The desire\r\nof all nations shall come.” One of the first hymns of Wesley, it\r\nappeared in a small book of 24 pages. _Hymns for the Nativity of our\r\nLord_, published in 1744. It is found in nearly all the modern hymn\r\nbooks in England and America.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HYFRYDOL is a Welsh tune composed by Rowland Hugh Prichard,\r\n1811-87, of Bala, Wales, who was active in the church as song leader,\r\nsoloist, and composer of tunes. This tune is a composition of his youth,\r\nwhile he was still under twenty. It is characterized by its length,\r\nsmoothness, and utter simplicity, the whole melody moving throughout,\r\nexcept for one note, within the compass of the fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HIS BIRTH\r\n\r\n\r\n70. Joy to the world! the Lord is come          _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nThis hymn, which has such an important place in the yearly celebration\r\nof the Nativity, is a free rendering of the latter part of Psalm 98:\r\n“Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud noise,\r\nand rejoice, and sing praise.” Watts entitled it, “Messiah’s Coming and\r\nKingdom.” His effort to put the New Testament gospel into the Psalm\r\nresulted in a great hymn of the Advent and Nativity, though his free\r\nrendering nearly lost sight of the Psalm itself. He feels all nature\r\nthrilling with joy at the Saviour’s birth.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ANTIOCH is an arrangement, credited by some authorities to\r\nLowell Mason, from Handel’s _Messiah_. The opening phrase resembles the\r\nfirst bar of the chorus, “Lift up your heads,” and the four measures set\r\nto “and heaven and nature sing” are reminiscent of the introduction to\r\nthe tenor recitative, “Comfort ye my people.” It is a stirring tune well\r\nfitted to the words. It may be sung antiphonally to good effect, the\r\ncongregation singing lines 1 and 2 (1st score), the choir, lines 3 and 4\r\n(2d and 3d scores), and both choir and congregation the refrain (last\r\nscore).\r\n\r\n\r\n71. Christians, awake! salute the happy morn     _John Byrom_, 1692-1763\r\n\r\nFrom a longer poem of 48 lines, written about 1749, by Dr. John Byrom\r\nfor his daughter Dolly who, when asked what she would like to have for a\r\nChristmas present, replied, “Please write me a poem.” On Christmas\r\nmorning she found on her plate at the breakfast table a sheet of paper\r\non which was written this poem, entitled, “Christmas Day. For Dolly.” It\r\nis based on Luke 2.\r\n\r\nJohn Byrom was born in Manchester, England, graduated from Cambridge,\r\nstudied medicine but gave up its practice in order to teach a system of\r\nshorthand he himself had invented, and which became the chief system of\r\nshorthand in his time. He was a friend of Charles and John Wesley and\r\ntaught them shorthand, which Charles especially put to good use in\r\ndashing down hymns as they flashed into his mind. Byrom was a man of\r\nlearning and piety and also was given to wit and humor. He coined the\r\nphrase “tweedledum and tweedledee” when the friends of Handel and\r\nBuononcini were debating the relative merits of the two composers:\r\n\r\n  Some say, compared to Buononcini\r\n    That Mynheer Handel is a ninny.\r\n  Others aver that he to Handel\r\n    Is scarcely fit to hold a candle.\r\n  Strange all this difference should be\r\n    Twixt tweedledum and tweedledee.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ YORKSHIRE was composed by a musician and organist, John\r\nWainwright, of whom little is known. He is remembered principally by\r\nthis tune. Musically and emotionally, the tune is completely\r\nsatisfactory and well deserves its great popularity. It has been a\r\nfavorite among English speaking people for nearly a century.\r\n\r\n\r\n72. Today be joy in every heart         _Frederick L. Hosmer_, 1840-1929\r\n\r\nA hymn of Christmas peace.\r\n\r\nThe author, Frederic L. Hosmer, one of America’s foremost hymn writers,\r\nwas born in Framingham, Mass., and died in Berkeley, Calif. He was\r\neducated at Harvard University and Divinity School and served as\r\nminister of Unitarian churches in Northboro, Mass., Quincy, Ill.,\r\nCleveland, O., St. Louis, Mo., and Berkeley, Calif. At least 35 of his\r\nhymns have come into more or less use in this country and in England.\r\nThe _Hymnary_ includes thirteen, a larger number than of any other\r\nwriter except Wesley and Watts.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DORKING, an English folk tune of anonymous composition, as all\r\nfolk tunes are, has characteristic grace of melody and strength of\r\nrhythm.\r\n\r\n\r\n73-74. While shepherds watched their flocks      _Nahum Tate_, 1652-1715\r\n\r\nThis carol is the work of Nahum Tate, poet laureate and co-author with\r\nNicholas Brady of the _New Version_ of the psalms in meter, to which was\r\nadded a supplement in 1770 containing this hymn. The quaint and\r\npicturesque paraphrase of Luke 2:9-11, closing with the doxology, was\r\none of the few hymns permitted to be sung in the English churches along\r\nwith the metrical psalms. It became very popular and has been translated\r\ninto the Latin and nearly all the living languages. The words have been\r\nset to many tunes.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Nahum Tate, see Hymn 18.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CHRISTMAS is an adaptation of a melody from Handel’s opera,\r\n_Siroe_. Geo. F. Handel was born in Prussia in 1685 (the same year as J.\r\nS. Bach) and died in 1759. He lived in England 50 years and became a\r\nnaturalized English citizen. He wrote many forms of music but is chiefly\r\nknown and loved for his oratorio, _The Messiah_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. MARTIN’S (74), by William Tans’ur, is less joyful than\r\n“Christmas,” but the tune fits the words perfectly. Its quiet, mystic\r\nmelody suggests the serenity of the Judean hillside where shepherds\r\nwatched their flocks.\r\n\r\nWilliam Tans’ur, 1706-85, was the son of a laborer, whose name is\r\nspelled “Tanzer” in the church register. He became a teacher of\r\npsalmody, moved from town to town to conduct singing classes, and did\r\nmuch to improve psalm-singing in the Church of England. He published a\r\nnumber of books on music. An eccentric man, given to self-advertisement,\r\nhe described his first volume _The Harmony of Sion_, 1734, as “The most\r\ncuriosest Book that ever was published.”\r\n\r\n\r\n75. It came upon a midnight clear             _Edmund H. Sears_, 1810-76\r\n\r\nPublished by the _Christian Register_ in 1860, the hymn quickly attained\r\nwide popularity. Edmund H. Sears was minister of a Unitarian Church at\r\nWayland, Mass. He wrote, “Though I was educated in the Unitarian\r\ndenomination, I believe and preach the divinity of Christ.” A careful\r\nreading of the hymn reveals a fine social message. The author was\r\nwriting at a time of extraordinary unrest throughout the world, caused\r\nin America by the passing of the Fugitive Slave Law, the great\r\nforty-niner gold rush to California, and in Europe by the aftermath of\r\nthe revolution in France and Germany. In the stillness of the first\r\nChristmas night, the author finds a message of healing for our\r\nrestlessness, and with Isaiah looks forward to a golden age when peace\r\nshall reign on earth. But when will that time come? The Civil War,\r\ntragic irony, followed in ten years! The hope, however, abides and is\r\nvalid, for peace is in the ultimate plan of God.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CAROL was composed by Richard Storrs Willis, brother of the\r\nAmerican poet, N. P. Willis. It is a graceful, popular tune, and is\r\noften set to “While shepherds watched their flock by night,” for which\r\nit is admirably adapted.\r\n\r\n\r\n76. The first Noel the angel did say                       _Traditional_\r\n\r\n“Noel” is a French word which came to mean several things—a “song of the\r\nBirthday,” or “Christmas,” or “Carol.” A carol is a religious song\r\ntelling the story of a place or person or event. It is less formal and\r\nsolemn than an ordinary church hymn and was originally intended to be\r\nsung outside rather than within the church walls. The words and music of\r\nthis carol are traditional, which means that no one knows who composed\r\nthem or when. They are known to have existed as early as the 17th\r\ncentury. It is a very popular carol even though not quite true to the\r\ngospel account in verse 2, for it was the wise men, not the shepherds,\r\nthat saw the star. Since most of the words have to do with the coming of\r\nthe wise men, the carol is fully as suitable for Epiphany as for\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune THE FIRST NOEL is one of the best-known of all English\r\ncarol airs, especially in the west of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n77. The stars were silent and the hills                       _E. Royce_\r\n\r\nThe poem was published in the _Presbyterian_ about 1939. No specific\r\ninformation is at hand concerning the author. Bixel, composer of the\r\nmusic, is under the impression that E. Royce was a missionary to China\r\nwho sent this poem to her church paper for publication.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SILENT was composed for this carol by James W. Bixel, who was\r\nborn at Bluffton, Ohio, November 7, 1913. After graduating from Bluffton\r\nCollege, Bixel studied music in Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, where\r\nhe received his Master of Music degree in composition. He taught music\r\nin the public schools of Mt. Gilead, Ohio, and then spent nearly four\r\nyears in Civilian Public Service. In the fall of 1947 he became a\r\nteacher of harmony and piano in the music department of Bethel College.\r\nThe tune, begun and completed in one evening, has the distinction of\r\nbeing the only one in the _Hymnary_ composed by a Mennonite. Which leads\r\none to observe that our hymns and tunes, like many other elements in our\r\nculture, are “ours” by appreciation and use rather than by invention or\r\ncreation. It may be the future will find us less “practical” minded than\r\nheretofore and that poetic and musical gifts will yet come to fruition\r\nto make our contribution to the stream of hymns and tunes that have\r\nenriched the worship of the Visible Church of all places and ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n78. What child is this                         _William C. Dix_, 1837-98\r\n\r\nOne of numerous carols written by William Dix about 1865.\r\n\r\nWilliam Chatterton Dix was the son of a Bristol surgeon. He was educated\r\nfor a business career and became the manager of a marine insurance\r\ncompany in Glasgow. He maintained, however, his literary interests and\r\nwrote the _Life of Chatterton_, the poet; a book of _Pen Pictures of\r\nPopular English Preachers_; and other works, including several volumes\r\nof devotional poetry. He had been ill in bed on Epiphany Day, and after\r\nreading the Gospel for the day, he wrote this hymn, finishing it by\r\nevening. It became very popular and is found in nearly all English\r\nhymnals. The accuracy of the second verse may be questioned—“To that\r\nlowly manger bed.” For it is not likely that the babe Jesus was still in\r\nthe manger when the wise men appeared.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CHRIST THE KING, known in many hymnals as “Greensleeves,” is an\r\nold English melody of the 17th century, mentioned somewhere by\r\nShakespeare. It is a joyous tune which may be sung as a solo, or with\r\nthe sopranos singing the words of the stanzas, while the other parts hum\r\nthe accompaniment, then all parts singing the refrain in harmony or in\r\nunison.\r\n\r\n\r\n79. Come, all ye shepherds                                 _Traditional_\r\n\r\nA shepherd carol from Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThe words and music are traditional.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune was arranged by Edward Shippen Barnes, b. 1887,\r\nAmerican organist and composer who received his musical education at\r\nYale and in Paris. He now lives at Santa Monica, California. His\r\npersonal counsel was solicited and secured in the compilation and\r\nediting of the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n80. O come, all ye faithful                                      _Latin_\r\n\r\n    Adeste, fideles,\r\n    Laeti triumphantes;\r\n  Venite, venite in Bethlehem;\r\n    Natum videte\r\n    Regem Angelorum:\r\n  Venite, adoremus Dominum.\r\n\r\n    Deum de Deo;\r\n    Lumen de Lumine,\r\n  Gestant puellae viscera\r\n    Deum Verum,\r\n    Genitum, non factum:\r\n  Venite, adoremus Dominum.\r\n\r\n    Ergo Qui natus\r\n    Die hodierna,\r\n  Iesu, Tibi sit gloria:\r\n    Patris Aeterni\r\n    Verbum Caro factum!\r\n  Venite, adoremus Dominum.\r\n\r\nA priceless legacy from the Latin Church and one of the most popular of\r\nChristmas hymns. It has been translated into at least 125 languages. The\r\norigin of the text and tune is obscure. The original poem may have been\r\nGerman or French of the 17th or 18th century.\r\n\r\nFrom the lengthy (and on the whole profitless) discussions of the\r\npossible origins of the hymn, it may be concluded that the hymn and tune\r\ncame into use together, in the services of the Roman Church, during the\r\nfirst part of the 18th century; that they were circulated first in\r\nmanuscript form and later appeared in print, the earliest known book\r\ncontaining them being a small volume, _An Essay on the Church Plain\r\nChant_, published in London, 1782. Nothing definite can be stated as to\r\nthe authors of either words or music.\r\n\r\nThe translation was made in 1841 by Frederick Oakeley, 1802-80, Church\r\nof England minister who later joined the Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ADESTE FIDELES belongs by long association to this hymn, its\r\nname being derived from the first words of the Latin. It is also widely\r\nused with “How firm a foundation.” The present arrangement is credited\r\nto Vincent Novello, organist in the Portuguese Chapel in London about\r\n1785.\r\n\r\n\r\n81. Angels from the realms of glory        _James Montgomery_, 1771-1854\r\n\r\nA graceful lyric presenting to the imagination a series of pictures—the\r\nAngels, the Shepherds, the Wise Men, and the Saints who like Simeon and\r\nAnna, were waiting for the consolation of Israel. The fourth verse is\r\nreminiscent of the prophetic words of Malachi: “The Lord whom ye seek\r\nshall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant\r\nwhom ye delight in: behold he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts”\r\n(3:1).\r\n\r\nIt is widely used for the Christmas season.\r\n\r\nFor comments on James Montgomery see Hymn 62.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ REGENT SQUARE is a jubilant, vigorous tune, composed for the\r\nEnglish _Presbyterian Hymnal_ of 1867 in which it was set to Bonar’s\r\nhymn, “Glory be to God the Father.”\r\n\r\nThe composer, Henry Smart, 1813-79, studied law for four years and then\r\ndecided to become a musician. Though he had little formal musical\r\ntraining, he became a great organist, composer, and conductor. He became\r\ntotally blind by 1865, but, being a capable improviser, and possessing a\r\nkeen memory, he was able to continue as an organist. He did much for the\r\ncause of good music in the church.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Smart see Hymn 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n82. Angels we have heard on high                       _Bishop Chadwick_\r\n\r\nA popular carol of French origin, sung first in England by the\r\nWestminster Abbey Choir and for that reason it is sometimes called the\r\n“Westminster Carol.”\r\n\r\nNo information has been traced concerning Bishop Chadwick.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GLORIA is a traditional melody of anonymous composition. The\r\ntune has been variously harmonized. This version is found in the _St.\r\nBasil’s Hymnal_, compiled by the Basilian Fathers, and published in\r\nChicago, 1918 (Revised Ed.).\r\n\r\n\r\n83. Silent night, holy night                    _Joseph Mohr_, 1792-1848\r\n\r\nThe most loved and most widely used of all Christmas carols.\r\n\r\nIt was composed December 24, 1818, by Joseph Mohr, 1792-1848, assistant\r\nCatholic priest in an obscure German village, Oberndorf, near Salzburg,\r\nAustria. At a Christmas celebration in the schoolhouse Mohr withdrew for\r\na time, then returned with a folded sheet of paper on which this carol\r\nwas written. He handed it to his friend, Franz Gruber, 1787-1863,\r\nschoolmaster, song writer, and organist, as a Christmas gift. Gruber\r\ncomposed the tune for it the same evening. The author and composer sang\r\nit together, the latter accompanying on the guitar, and a choir of girls\r\nfrom the village joining in the melody. The hymn and the tune became\r\nimmensely popular in Germany and Austria even before they appeared in\r\nprint, through their use by wandering Tyrolese singers. Today the carol\r\nis sung in all Christian lands. It was a favorite of the great opera\r\nsinger Madame Ernestine Schumann-Heink, and she sang it on many of her\r\nconcert appearances.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ STILLE NACHT. In keeping with German custom, the tune is named\r\nafter the first line of the hymn for which it was written.\r\n\r\nA plaque in the schoolhouse at Oberndorf bears the following\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n  Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht!\r\n  Wer hat dich, O Lied, gemacht?\r\n  Mohr hat dich so schoen erdacht,\r\n  Gruber zu Gehoer gebracht,\r\n  Priester und Lehrer vereint.\r\n\r\n\r\n84. O little town of Bethlehem                _Phillips Brooks_, 1835-93\r\n\r\nThis carol was written for children, but it has become popular\r\neverywhere with adults as well.\r\n\r\nPhillips Brooks, one of America’s greatest preachers, grew up in a\r\nmusical home where memorizing and reciting of hymns was a part of the\r\nchildren’s education. By the time he was ready for college he had\r\ncommitted over 200 hymns to memory. He graduated from Harvard and from\r\nthe Episcopal Theological Seminary, Alexandria, Virginia, and served as\r\nrector at the Church of the Advent, Philadelphia, and at Trinity Church,\r\nBoston, where his preaching powers came to full and fruitful fruition.\r\nIn 1891, he became Bishop of Massachusetts. While in Philadelphia, he\r\nwas given a year’s leave of absence to travel in Europe and the Near\r\nEast. In Christmas Week in 1865, he rode on horseback from Jerusalem to\r\nBethlehem. The view of the little town is thought to have inspired this\r\nhymn which he wrote several years later for the Christmas service of the\r\nSunday school in his church.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. LOUIS. Brooks asked his church organist, Lewis Redner, who\r\nwas also Sunday school superintendent, to set the carol to music. This\r\nwas done in great haste on the Saturday night before Christmas, 1868.\r\nThe words and tune, printed on leaflets, were sung by six teachers and\r\n36 Sunday school children, and then practically forgotten until 1892\r\nwhen they were published in the _Hymnal of the Episcopal Church_. The\r\nhymn has become popular since, not only in America but also in England.\r\nThe tune generally used in England, however, is not “St. Louis,” but\r\n“Forest Green.” (See 290.)\r\n\r\n\r\n85. Hark the herald angels sing                _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular English hymns. Julian listed four hymns as\r\nstanding at the head of all in the English language: “When I survey”\r\n(105-6), “Rock of Ages” (148), “Awake my soul” (25), and this one.\r\n\r\nIt is taken from Wesley’s _Hymns and Sacred Poems_, 1739. The original\r\nhad 10 four-line stanzas and no refrain. The hymn has been altered in\r\nvarious ways and improved. For example, the lines,\r\n\r\n  With the angelic host proclaim,\r\n    Christ is born in Bethlehem,\r\n\r\noriginally read\r\n\r\n  Universal nature say\r\n    Christ the Lord is born today.\r\n\r\nAnd for our familiar first lines,\r\n\r\n  Hark! the herald angels sing!\r\n    Glory to the new-born King,\r\n\r\nWesley had\r\n\r\n  Hark! how all the welkin rings,\r\n    Glory to the King of Kings.\r\n\r\nThese, and other changes, disprove the common assertion that hymns\r\nshould always be sung just as the authors left them. As a rule, however,\r\nit still remains true that “the _professional_ hymn mender is an odious\r\ncreature.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MENDELSSOHN, also called “Bethlehem” and “St. Vincent,” is from\r\nMendelssohn’s _Festgesang_ for Male Chorus and Orchestra, composed in\r\n1840 to celebrate the invention of printing. The tune is adapted from\r\nchorus No. 2 of that work. Dr. W. H. Cummings, organist at Waltham\r\nAbbey, set the tune to the words of this hymn and had it sung by the\r\nAbbey Choir. It was so well received that he published it in 1856 and it\r\nhas since found its way into the hymn books of all denominations.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note Mendelssohn’s own estimate of the tune, as he\r\nexpressed it in a letter to his English publishers.\r\n\r\n  I am sure that piece will be liked very much by the singers and\r\n  hearers, but it will never do to sacred words. There must be a\r\n  national and merry subject found out, something to which the\r\n  soldier-like and buxom motion of the piece has some relation, and the\r\n  words must express something gay and popular as the music tries to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n86. O holy night\r\n\r\nThe night of the Saviour’s birth is the subject of Christmas carols in\r\nevery land, of which this and “Silent Night” are outstanding examples.\r\nThe words are anonymous.\r\n\r\nThe omitted third stanza reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  Truly He taught us to love one another;\r\n    His law is love and His gospel is peace.\r\n  Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother,\r\n    And in His name all oppression shall cease.\r\n  Sweet hymn of joy in grateful chorus raise we,\r\n    Let all within us praise His holy name;\r\n  Christ is the Lord, Oh, praise His name forever!\r\n    His power and glory evermore proclaim.\r\n    His power and glory evermore proclaim.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune, HOLY NIGHT, is by Adolphe Adam, 1803-56,\r\ndistinguished French composer of comic operas and teacher of\r\ncomposition. He became a professor in the Conservatory of Music in Paris\r\nin 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HIS EPIPHANY\r\n\r\n\r\n87. What star is this                             _C. Coffin_, 1676-1749\r\n\r\nA Latin hymn, _Quae stella sole pulchrior_, was included in the _Paris\r\nBreviary_, 1736, and, again, in Coffin’s _Hymni Sacri_, 1736. Charles\r\nCoffin, rector of the University of Paris, wrote a large number of\r\nhymns, “not so much,” he says, “to gratify the poetic Spirit as to\r\nachieve elegance and piety.”\r\n\r\nThe translation is by John Chandler, 1806-76, in his _Hymns of the\r\nPrimitive Church_, 1837. Chandler was educated at Oxford and became a\r\nminister in the Church of England. Besides making a collection of hymns,\r\nhe is the author of several biographies and volumes of devotional\r\nliterature. His translation of this hymn has passed into many English\r\nhymn books but invariably with some alterations.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PUER NOBIS is an arrangement of a German folk tune published by\r\nthe German composer, Michael Praetorius, 1571-1621, which he wrote in\r\n1609. It was harmonized in 1904 by G. R. Woodward, an English musician.\r\nIt is a spirited tune and should be sung briskly and merrily.\r\n\r\n\r\n88. Bethlehem, of noblest cities              _Prudentius_, 348-_c._ 413\r\n                                               _Tr. E. Caswall_, 1814-78\r\n\r\nBased on Matt. 2:6: “And thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art not\r\nthe least among the princes of Judah: for out of thee shall come a\r\ngovernor, that shall rule my people Israel,” and the story of the three\r\nwise men bringing their gifts to Jesus.\r\n\r\nThe author, Prudentius, 348-c. 413, a Spaniard, was one of the best and\r\nmost prolific of early Latin Christian poets. He received legal training\r\nand served as lawyer and judge in several cities. At the age of 57 he\r\nentered a monastery and for the rest of his life was a writer of poetry\r\nin defense of and in praise of the Christian faith. He is regarded by\r\nsome as the first really great Christian poet and was widely read in\r\nEurope throughout the Middle Ages, Erasmus being one of his admirers.\r\n\r\nThe translation is by Edward Caswall who shortly before had left the\r\nChurch of England to become a priest in the Roman Catholic Church.\r\nCaswall was a Latin scholar and did much translating of Latin hymns. For\r\nfurther comments on Caswall see Hymn 19.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ STUTTGART is adapted from a melody by Christian F. Witt in his\r\n_Psalmodia Sacra_, published in Gotha, 1715, where it is set to the\r\nhymn, “_Sollt es gleich bisweilen scheinen_.” It is a stately,\r\nstraightforward tune of simple, rhythmic pattern and is singable by any\r\naverage congregation.\r\n\r\nChristian F. Witt, 1660-1716, was a court organist and later\r\n_Kapellmeister_ at Gotha. He composed a number of hymn tunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n89. From the eastern mountains               _Godfrey Thring_, 1823-1903\r\n\r\nBased on Matt. 2:2: “We have seen his star in the east and are come to\r\nworship Him.” Its reference to the guiding star and its missionary\r\nemphasis fit it ideally for the Epiphany season, but the hymn may be\r\nused appropriately on more general occasions.\r\n\r\nGodfrey Thring was educated at Shrewsbury and Balliol College, Oxford,\r\nand held various positions as minister in the Church of England. In\r\n1859, he succeeded his father as rector of Alford-with-Hornblotton and\r\nin 1876, became prebendary of East Harptree in Wells Cathedral. He\r\npublished various hymn books of a high literary standard.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PRINCETHORPE. This tune, by William Pitts, 1824-1903, was taken\r\nfrom _The Hymnary_ of the United Church of Canada. No information is at\r\nhand concerning the composer or the origin of the tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n90. We three kings of Orient are         _John H. Hopkins, Jr._, 1820-91\r\n\r\nA popular carol giving the story of the wise men seeing the star and\r\nbringing gifts to the Christ child.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Hopkins, Jr., was born at Pittsburgh, Pa. His father was an\r\nEpiscopalian minister who became the Bishop of Vermont. John was\r\neducated at the University of Vermont and later was minister at\r\nWilliamsport, Pa. He is the author of several books of poems.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ KINGS OF ORIENT was composed for this hymn by the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n91. Brightest and best of the sons           _Reginald Heber_, 1783-1826\r\n\r\nA lovely hymn of great beauty and simplicity of form and characterized\r\nby robust faith—“richer by far is the heart’s adoration.” It was written\r\nfor the feast of Epiphany and was entitled, “Star of the East.” The hymn\r\nwas first published in the _Christian Observer_, 1811.\r\n\r\nHeber, a hymnist of the first order, ranking with Wesley and Watts, was\r\ngoverned by three ideas in his hymn writing: (1) the hymn is liturgical\r\nand should follow the church year; (2) the hymn should follow and\r\nsupplement the sermon; (3) the hymn should be literary art.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Reginald Heber see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BRIGHTEST AND BEST was composed by Rev. Joseph Francis Thrupp,\r\n1827-67, fellow of Cambridge College and minister in the Church of\r\nEngland. He is the author of several books on Biblical subjects and\r\nwrote a number of hymns of merit, none of which have come into general\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HIS LIFE AND MINISTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n92. O sing a song of Bethlehem              _Louis F. Benson_, 1855-1930\r\n\r\nWritten as a Christmas carol but sings also of the later life of Jesus\r\nin Nazareth, Galilee, and at Calvary. It was contributed to _The School\r\nHymnal_ (Presbyterian), edited by Dr. Benson in 1899.\r\n\r\nLouis Fitzgerald Benson was born in Philadelphia and educated for the\r\nbar. After seven years of practice, he gave up law to enter Princeton\r\nTheological Seminary and was ordained a Presbyterian minister. He became\r\nminister of the Church of the Redeemer, Germantown, Pa., but resigned\r\nhis charge after six years, to begin his great work as editor of hymn\r\nbooks and writer and lecturer on hymnology. His book, _The English\r\nHymn_, unfortunately out of print, has no rival as a source of accurate\r\ninformation about the development and use of English and American hymns.\r\nHis _Studies in Familiar Hymns_ (2 vols.) is unexcelled. For forty years\r\nDr. Benson rendered outstanding service to all students of hymnology\r\nthrough his writings and lectures on the subject. He composed 32\r\noriginal hymns and made 16 translations from the Latin which were\r\npublished as _Hymns, Original and Translated_, Philadelphia, 1925, in\r\nwhich the present hymn appears.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BETHLEHEM, also called “Evangel,” was composed by Gottfried W.\r\nFink, 1783-1846, German minister, musician, music critic, and editor,\r\nwho was appointed in 1842 to a Professorship of Music at Leipzig. It is\r\na joyful tune in popular style, especially suitable for large choruses\r\nor congregations.\r\n\r\n\r\n93. O Master Workman of the race            _Jay T. Stocking_, 1870-1936\r\n\r\nA hymn entitled, “The Carpenter of Nazareth,” written for young people\r\nwhile the author was watching some carpenters at work in an Adirondack\r\nCamp. It is one of a number of excellent modern hymns concerned with the\r\nearthly life of Jesus and connecting Him with our daily life and labor.\r\nOthers are “O Master let me walk with Thee” (223), “Where cross the\r\ncrowded ways” (222), and “O Son of Man, Thou madest known” (373).\r\n\r\nJay T. Stocking was educated at Amherst, Yale Divinity School, and at\r\nthe University of Berlin. He was ordained in 1901, held a number of\r\nprominent pastorates in the Congregational Church, and was made\r\nmoderator of the Congregational Council in 1934. He is the author of\r\nseveral books and was a member of the Commission on International\r\nJustice and Good Will of the Federal Council of Churches.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. MICHEL’S appeared in a collection of _Psalms and Hymns_,\r\ncompiled by William Gawler, and published in London around 1784 to 1789,\r\nfor use of the children of an orphan asylum at Lambeth. It was set to\r\n“Creator Spirit, by whose aid,” a long-meter hymn. Later the tune was\r\nchanged to common meter double. It is also known by the names “St.\r\nMaria,” “Beulah,” and “Woolrich Common.” The composer of the tune is not\r\nknown. _The Hymnary_ of the United Church of Canada attributes it to\r\nHaydn. At No. 125 of the _Hymnary_ it appears as “Jerusalem, Jerusalem,”\r\nwhere it is erroneously attributed, in the earlier editions, to Thomas\r\nHastings—an error carried over from the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_. Hastings\r\nwas born at about the same time the tune was already in print! It is\r\npossible, of course, that he made an arrangement of the tune, and\r\nthereby getting his name associated, inadvertently, with its\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nWm. Gawler, c. 1750-1809, was a London musician and music publisher. In\r\n1785, while organist at the Lambeth “Asylum,” a home, the first of its\r\nkind in England, for fatherless girls, he published the book _Psalms and\r\nHymns_, referred to, later adding a supplement. Gawler made other\r\ncompilations of music books and also did some composing.\r\n\r\n\r\n94. Ye fair green hills of Galilee          _Eustace R. Conder_, 1820-92\r\n\r\nA fine hymn, setting forth obedience to duty and love to God and man as\r\nthe marks of Christ’s followers. It was contributed by the author to the\r\n_Congregational Church Hymnal_, London, 1887.\r\n\r\nEustace Rogers Conder studied for the Congregational ministry in\r\nBirmingham and later graduated with high honors in philosophy at London\r\nUniversity. For 17 years, he was minister of a Congregational Church at\r\nPoole, where he trained students for missionary work, besides attending\r\nto his regular duties as pastor. In 1873, he was elected chairman of the\r\nCongregational Union of England and Wales. He wrote several books,\r\nincluding _Outlines of the Life of Christ_ and _Sleepy Forest_, a book\r\nof fairy tales for children.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ STELLA is from an old English melody in 6-8 time which the\r\nchildren sang to “Sweet Mary, sweet Mary, my age is sixteen.” About\r\n1850, it was arranged by Henri F. Hemy, 1818-88, English organist, for\r\nuse in Catholic churches as an easy choir number. In 1875, the tune\r\nappeared (almost note for note as in the _Hymnary_) in the Appendix of\r\n_St. Alban’s Tune Book_, a book of pre-Reformation hymns set to\r\nplainsong melodies. The Appendix of the book is a treasure house of\r\narrangements and adaptations of singable tunes from sacred and secular\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n\r\n95. Thine arm, O Lord, in days of old      _Edward H. Plumptre_, 1821-91\r\n\r\nA hymn on the healing ministry of Christ, written in 1864 for use in the\r\nChapel of King’s College Hospital, London. Suitable for Hospital Day and\r\nother occasions.\r\n\r\nEdward Hayes Plumptre, an English scholar and church man, was educated\r\nat King’s College, London, and at Oxford. He was minister in various\r\nchurches (Anglican) and became Professor of New Testament Exegesis at\r\nKing’s College. He wrote many excellent books, including the standard\r\n_Life of Bishop Ken_, and several volumes of poems. He was appointed a\r\nmember of the Old Testament Company of Revisers of the Bible. This hymn\r\nwas included in the 2d edition of his _Lazarus, and other Poems_, from\r\nwhich it made its way into the hymnals.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. MATTHEW, a psalm tune, appeared in the 6th ed. (1708) of _A\r\nSupplement to the New Version of Psalms_, by Tate and Brady, where it\r\nwas set, in two parts, treble and bass, to Psalm 33. In slightly altered\r\nform, it became one of the great hymn tunes but is more popular in\r\nEngland than in America.\r\n\r\nFor comments on William Croft, 1678-1727, an important name in English\r\nchurch music, see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n96. Who is he in yonder stall                  _Benj. R. Hanby_, 1833-67\r\n\r\nA hymn on the birth, ministry, passion, resurrection, and exaltation of\r\nChrist, the refrain answering the question asked in each stanza. It may\r\nbe used effectively for antiphonal singing between choir and\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\nThe author, Benjamin Russel Hanby, was a minister in the United Brethren\r\nChurch but was strongly inclined to music and decided to make that his\r\nlife work. An interesting and talented man, he became associated with\r\nGeorge F. Root in the publication of sacred and secular song books in\r\nChicago. He was the author of a number of Sunday school songs and of\r\n“Darling Nellie Gray,” “Old Shady,” and other popular numbers. His\r\nuntimely death ended his career almost before it was well begun. His\r\nfather, the Rev. William Hanby, was a bishop in the church of the United\r\nBrethren in Christ and editor, for a number of years, of _The\r\nTelescope_, the church’s official paper published at Circleville, Ohio.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LOWLINESSS was composed by the author of the words.\r\n\r\n\r\n97. Fairest Lord Jesus                                   _Münster_, 1677\r\n                                                 _Translated_, _c._ 1850\r\n\r\nCalled the “Crusader’s Hymn,” but there is no foundation for the\r\ntradition that it was sung by the German knights of the 12th century on\r\ntheir way to Jerusalem. The text and tune are modern. The German text\r\nwas published in _Münster Gesangbuch_, 1677 (Catholic). Our translation,\r\nthe oldest English version, is by an unknown author, about 1850. A later\r\ntranslation, beginning “Beautiful Savior,” was made by J. A. Seiss in\r\n1873. The original is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Schönster Herr Jesu,\r\n    Herrscher aller Herren,\r\n  Gottes und Mariä Sohn!\r\n    Dich will ich lieben,\r\n    Dich will ich ehren.\r\n  Meiner Seelen Freund’ und Kron’.\r\n\r\n    Schön leucht’t der Monden,\r\n    Schöner die Sonne\r\n  Als die Sternlein allzumal.\r\n    Jesus leucht’t schöner,\r\n    Jesus leucht’t reiner,\r\n  Als all die Engel im Himmelssaal.\r\n\r\n    Schön sind die Wälder,\r\n    Schöner die Felder\r\n  In der schönen Frühlingszeit.\r\n    Jesus ist schöner,\r\n    Jesus ist reiner,\r\n  Der unser traurigs Herz erfreut.\r\n\r\n    Alle die Schönheit\r\n    Himmels und der Erde\r\n  Ist nur gegen ihn als Schein.\r\n    Keiner soll nimmer\r\n    Lieber uns werden\r\n  Als er, der schönste Jesus mein!\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CRUSADER’S HYMN, also known as _Schönster Herr Jesu_, appeared\r\nin a book of Silesian folk songs, _Schlesische Volkslieder_, Leipzig,\r\n1842. The hymn with this tune was first published in America in _Church\r\nCarols and Choir Studies_ by the American composer Richard Storrs\r\nWillis, 1850. F. Melius Christiansen, director of the St. Olaf Choir,\r\nhas arranged an exquisite anthem on this melody with the words\r\n“Beautiful Savior.”\r\n\r\nIt is a useful and charming melody. Its popularity in Germany ranks with\r\nPaul Gerhardt’s “_Befiehl du deine Wege_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n98. Not always on the mount             _Frederick L. Hosmer_, 1840-1929\r\n\r\nBased on the story of the transfiguration in Matthew 17, the lesson\r\nenforced by the hymn is that the mount is necessary for vision; we\r\ncannot abide there, yet our work in the valley will be nobler for the\r\npattern shown us on the mount.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Frederick L. Hosmer see Hymn 72.\r\n\r\nThe hymn, written in 1882, was first published in _Unity_, Chicago,\r\nApril 1, 1884. A year later it was included, in revised form, in the\r\nauthor’s first series of _The Thought of God_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ TRANSYLVANIA is from a 16th century Hungarian chorale, arranged\r\nby Robert L. Sanders, F. A. A. R., Chicago, for _Hymns of the Spirit_,\r\nBeacon Press, 1938.\r\n\r\n\r\n99. I know not how that Bethlehem’s Babe          _Harry W. Farrington_,\r\n                                                               1880-1931\r\n\r\nA Christmas song written in 1910, while the author was a graduate\r\nstudent at Harvard University. It was awarded the prize which had been\r\noffered for the best Christmas hymn written by a student. Though simple\r\nand unpretentious, Professor George Herbert Palmer declared it “a\r\nperfect poem.” The few lines encompass a vast body of Christian truth.\r\n\r\nThe author, Harry W. Farrington, 1880-1931 (date of death printed\r\nerroneously as 1911 in earlier editions of the _Hymnary_), was educated\r\nat Harvard and then became a Methodist minister. He was greatly\r\ninterested in work among children and inaugurated the Week Day Church\r\nSchool at Gary, Ind., in 1914. After returning from service in World War\r\nI, he became widely known as a speaker for children and it is estimated\r\nthat he addressed more than two million children in the public schools\r\nof America. He is the author of several volumes of poems and has written\r\nbooks on Franklin, Washington, Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ES IST EIN BORN, also named “I Do Believe,” and “Camp-meeting,”\r\nis an early American camp-meeting chorus sung to:\r\n\r\n  I do believe, I now believe,\r\n    I can hold out no more;\r\n  I sink by dying love compelled\r\n    And own Thee Conqueror.\r\n\r\nIt is used in the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_ to the words “_Es ist ein Born,\r\nd’raus heil’ges Blut_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HIS TRIUMPHAL ENTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n100. All glory laud and honor       _St. Theodulph of Orleans_, _c._ 820\r\n                                               _Tr. John M. Neale_, 1854\r\n\r\nFrom a long Latin hymn of 39 couplets, based on Psalm 24:7-10; Psalm\r\n118:25-26; Matthew 21:1-17; and Luke 19:37-38.\r\n\r\n  Gloria, laus et honor tibi sit, rex, Christe, redemptor,\r\n    cui puerile decus prompsit hosanna pium.\r\n\r\n  Israel tu rex, Davidis et inclyta proles,\r\n    nomine qui in Domini, rex benedicte, venis.\r\n\r\n  Coetus in excelsis te laudat caelicus omnis\r\n    et mortalis homo, cuncta creata simul.\r\n\r\n  Plebs Hebraea tibi cum palmis obvia venit;\r\n    cum prece, voto, hymnis adsumus ecce tibi.\r\n\r\n  Hi tibi passuro solvebant munia laudis;\r\n    nos tibi regnanti pangimus ecce melos.\r\n\r\n  Hi placuere tibi; placeat devotio nostra,\r\n    rex pie, rex clemens, cui bona cuncta placent. Amen.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was used as the processional in the Palm Sunday service of the\r\nmedieval church.\r\n\r\nSt. Theodulph of Orleans composed the words about A.D. 820. He was\r\nprobably born in Italy, though neither the date nor place of his birth\r\nare definitely known. Theodulph became the abbot of a monastery in\r\nFlorence but was later brought to France and made bishop of Orleans.\r\nEmperor Louis the Pious imprisoned him on a false charge of conspiracy\r\nin 818. There is a legend, but only a legend, that this hymn was\r\ncomposed during the author’s confinement, and that St. Theodulph sang it\r\nat the window of his cell as the King passed the prison on the way to\r\nchurch and that the latter was so moved by it that he ordered the\r\nrelease of Theodulph and his restoration to his office as bishop.\r\n\r\nThe translation was made by the learned John M. Neale (See 67) who wrote\r\nthat “another verse was usually sung, until the 17th century, at the\r\npious quaintness of which we can scarcely avoid a smile:\r\n\r\n  “Be thou, O Lord, the rider,\r\n    And we the little ass;\r\n  That to God’s holy city\r\n    Together we may pass.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. THEODULPH was composed by Melchior Teschner (c. 1615), a\r\nLutheran pastor and musician. It was originally sung to the German\r\nchorale, _Valet will ich dir geben_ (“Farewell, I gladly bid thee”), a\r\nhymn for the dying. That the same tune is used to carry a cheerful,\r\nfestive hymn, as well as a hymn for the dying, illustrates the\r\nplasticity of hymn tunes. Bach used the tune in his _St. John’s\r\nPassion_, and it is also associated with Gerhardt’s “_Wie soll ich dich\r\nempfangen_.” It is widely used as a Palm Sunday processional with St.\r\nTheodulph’s words. The refrain may be sung by the congregation,\r\nanswering to the verses sung by the choir. Processional hymns were\r\nalmost invariably sung that way in the medieval church and Canon\r\nDouglass suggests that “we should put this plan into far wider practice\r\nif we really desire to improve our congregational singing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n101. Ride on, ride on in majesty            _Henry H. Milman_, 1791-1868\r\n\r\nA popular Palm Sunday hymn and incidentally one of the finest poems in\r\nour hymn books. It was written by Henry H. Milman at the age of 30, the\r\nyear he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford University—1821.\r\n\r\nHenry H. Milman was born in London, the son of Sir Francis Milman,\r\nphysician to the King. After a brilliant career at Oxford, he was\r\nordained at 25, appointed Professor of Poetry at Oxford at 30. Later he\r\nbecame canon of Westminster and finally dean of St. Paul’s Cathedral in\r\nLondon, which high office he filled with distinction. He is the author\r\nof thirteen hymns. Milman was interested, too, in drama and wrote\r\nseveral plays and translated Greek plays. He is best known, however, as\r\na historian, having published _The History of the Jews_ in 1829, and the\r\n_History of Latin Christianity_ in 1855, both of them classics.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. DROSTANE was written for the words “Ride on, ride on” for\r\nthe _Congregational Hymn and Tune Book_, London, 1862. It has since come\r\ninto wide use with this hymn. Other tunes also used with this text are\r\n“Winchester New” (369) and “Park Street” (272).\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, J. B. Dykes, see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HIS PASSION\r\n\r\n\r\n102. When my love to God grows weak           _John R. Wreford_, 1800-81\r\n\r\nA useful hymn, true to the Gospel record, and free from the emotional\r\nmorbidity that is found in many passion hymns.\r\n\r\nJohn Wreford, an Englishman trained for the Unitarian ministry, was\r\ncompelled to give up his ministry on account of a failing voice. He then\r\nopened a school at Edgbaston. The later years of his life were spent in\r\nretirement at Bristol. The original of this hymn written in 1837,\r\nreceived little notice until it was rewritten and improved by Samuel\r\nLongfellow, brother of the more famous Henry Wadsworth. In this revised\r\nform it has been included in a number of the best English hymnals.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ORIENTIS PARTIBUS, the so-called “Donkey Festival Tune,” has a\r\nmost peculiar origin. During the Middle Ages, the church in some parts\r\nof France celebrated January 14 as the “Feast of the Ass,” to\r\ncommemorate the flight into Egypt. A beautiful young woman holding a\r\nchild in her arms rode a donkey through the streets of the town and then\r\ninto the principal church. The donkey, with its burden, stood beside the\r\nhigh altar while mass was celebrated, during which the hymn beginning\r\nwith the line “_Orientis partibus adventatis asinus_” was sung. The\r\nmelody of this hymn is the basis for our tune which was adapted by\r\nRichard Redhead and published in his _Church Hymn Tunes_, 1853. The\r\noriginal was the work of Pierre De Corbeil, Archbishop of Sens, who died\r\nin 1222. It is a virile tune worthy of its increasing place in modern\r\nhymn books.\r\n\r\nFor Richard Redhead see Hymn 109.\r\n\r\n\r\n103. ’Tis midnight and on Olive’s brow         _William Bingham Tappan_,\r\n                                                               1794-1849\r\n\r\nA midnight hymn, depicting the darkness and sadness of Gethsemane. It is\r\noften sung at communion services held on Thursday evening before Good\r\nFriday.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bingham Tappan, a clock maker, was an influential leader in\r\nSunday school work in the Congregational Church in America. In early\r\nmanhood he taught school in Philadelphia, and then from 1826 until his\r\ndeath he was in the employ of the American Sunday School Union as\r\nmanager and superintendent at Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and Boston. He\r\nwrote and published eight or ten volumes of poetry of no special\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ OLIVET’S BROW was composed for this hymn and was first\r\npublished in _The Shawm_, 1853, by Bradbury and Root.\r\n\r\nWilliam Batchelder Bradbury, 1816-68, was born in York, Maine. After\r\nmany struggles, due to poverty, he learned music from Lowell Mason and\r\nG. J. Webb and began conducting singing classes. He did outstanding work\r\nin New York City in teaching music to children. His Juvenile Music\r\nFestivals at the Baptist Tabernacle became an important feature of New\r\nYork’s musical life and gave a powerful stimulus to the introduction of\r\nmusic into the public schools. In 1847, he went abroad for further study\r\nin music. Upon returning to America, he became associated with Geo. F.\r\nRoot, Thos. Hastings, and Lowell Mason in musical Normal Institute work.\r\nThe group collaborated in the production of a new type of church music,\r\nknown as gospel songs, which swept the country during the revivalistic\r\nwork of Moody and Sankey.\r\n\r\n\r\n104. There is a green hill far away      _Mrs. Cecil Frances Alexander_,\r\n                                                                 1823-95\r\n\r\nA popular hymn on the atonement, written for children but appropriated\r\nfor general use with all ages. It was first published in the author’s\r\n_Hymns for Little Children_, 1848, her most famous book which ran into\r\n100 editions. The accuracy of the first line may well be questioned for\r\nthe Gospels do not state that Jesus was crucified on a hill, only that\r\nit was a place called “the skull” (Lk. 23:33). In any case, the\r\nsun-baked Judean hills are seldom green.\r\n\r\nCecil Frances Humphrey, daughter of Major John Humphrey, was a native of\r\nIreland. Her father was an Englishman who, as a landowner and government\r\nagent, went to reside in Ireland. In 1850, she married the Rev. Wm.\r\nAlexander who, after spending many years in obscure parish work, was\r\nelected Archbishop of Armagh and later Primate of all Ireland. Mrs.\r\nAlexander was preëminently a writer for little children, her verses\r\nbeing characterized by simplicity and tenderness and poetic beauty; but\r\nshe also contributed some notable church songs, e.g., “Jesus calls us\r\no’er the tumult” (140).\r\n\r\nTo make the truths of the church catechism interesting and intelligible\r\nto little children, Mrs. Alexander wrote a series of poems to illustrate\r\nthe Apostle’s Creed. This hymn is on the clause “suffered under Pontius\r\nPilate, was crucified, dead, and buried.” “All things bright and\r\nbeautiful” (410) was written for the first clause, “I believe in God the\r\nFather Almighty, maker of heaven and earth.” For the second clause, “And\r\nin Jesus Christ His Son, born of the virgin Mary” she wrote “Once in\r\nroyal David’s city” (412).\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MEDITATION appeared in _Original Tunes_, 1890, by John H.\r\nGower, where it is set to “There is a land of pure delight.” The tune\r\nhas since become closely associated with Mrs. Alexander’s hymn for which\r\nit forms an appropriate setting.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Gower, 1855-1922, English organist and concert artist, became\r\nprofessor of music at Trent College, Nottingham. Later he came to\r\nAmerica on account of mining interests in Colorado but maintained his\r\nactivity in music. He served as organist and choirmaster of St. John’s\r\nCathedral, Denver, and during the World’s Fair in Chicago, 1893, became\r\norganist of the Church of the Epiphany in that city.\r\n\r\n\r\n105-106. When I survey the wondrous cross       _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nOne of the twenty-five hymns prepared by Watts to be sung at the Lord’s\r\nSupper. Matthew Arnold, the famous literary critic, called it the “most\r\nmajestic hymn in the English language.” It is one of four hymns which\r\nhave been printed in more collections, translated into more tongues, and\r\nused in more congregations, than any other. The three hymns classed with\r\nthis in popularity are “Rock of Ages,” “Jesus, Lover of my soul,” and\r\n“All hail the power of Jesus’ name.”\r\n\r\nWatts gave this hymn the title “Crucifixion to the World by the Cross of\r\nChrist.” It is based on Galatians 6:14: “God forbid that I should glory\r\nsave in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is\r\ncrucified to me, and I unto the world.” In the first stanza there is a\r\nreference to Phil. 3:7: “Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have\r\nI counted loss for Christ.” The whole hymn, and especially the closing\r\nstanza, reflects the thought of Galatians 2:20: “I have been crucified\r\nwith Christ ... who loved me and gave himself for me.” The third stanza,\r\na sublime picture of the suffering Saviour, should always be sung\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts, see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ROCKINGHAM OLD is a famous tune always used with this hymn in\r\nEngland. It was named after the Marquis of Rockingham, a Whig statesman\r\nwho was thrice prime minister of England, and a friend of the composer.\r\n\r\nEdward Miller, 1731-1807, was born at Norwich, England, the son of a\r\nstone mason. He was a man of great literary attainments and considerable\r\nmusical ability. For 56 years he was organist of the parish church at\r\nDoncaster, receiving the appointment in 1751 and retaining the post\r\nuntil his death in 1807. Miller played the flute in Handel’s orchestra\r\nin London and had many a story to tell of the great composer’s\r\neccentricities. Dissatisfied with the church music of his time, he was\r\nled to publish a book, _Psalms of David_, which turned out to be a great\r\nsuccess. The book contained such tunes as “Burford” (228), “St. Magnes”\r\n(582), “St. Anne” (61), “Surrey” (44), and others of a similar style\r\nfrom the early part of the 18th century. It also contained some of his\r\noriginal tunes, including ROCKINGHAM OLD, destined to become one of the\r\nmost popular English tunes ever written. This tune was not identified at\r\nfirst with any particular words. Miller had set it to 9 different\r\npsalms, using 3 keys—F, E flat, and E. It became associated with Watts’\r\n“When I survey the wondrous cross,” in 1854, the combination appearing\r\nin _Mercer’s Church Psalter_, and again in 1861, in _Hymns Ancient and\r\nModern_. The words and tune have now become inseparable in England.\r\n\r\nHAMBURG (106), an arrangement by Lowell Mason from a Gregorian Chant,\r\nillustrates the greatness of simplicity. The tune employs only five\r\ntones of the scale and yet breathes the dignity and solemnity of the\r\ngreat hymn to which it is set.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Lowell Mason see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n107. Go to dark Gethsemane                 _James Montgomery_, 1771-1854\r\n\r\nA song of the sufferings and death of Christ.\r\n\r\nGethsemane, the Judgment Hall, and Calvary are successively brought to\r\nmind and at each stage there is found in the example of Christ a lesson\r\nfor his disciples to learn.\r\n\r\nThe fourth verse in the original poem reads:\r\n\r\n  Early hasten to the tomb\r\n    Where they laid his breathless clay;\r\n  All is solitude and gloom;\r\n    Who hath taken him away?\r\n  Christ is risen! he meets our eyes:\r\n  Saviour, teach us so to rise.\r\n\r\nFor comments on James Montgomery see Hymn 62.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GETHSEMANE is a dignified tune in the minor mode, well adapted\r\nto carry the words of this hymn. It was composed by Christopher Tye (c.\r\n1508-72), a musician and minister in the Anglican Church, of whom a\r\ncontemporary document says that he is “a doctor of music but not skilful\r\nat preaching.” He has been called the “father of the anthem,” having\r\ngiven it a model for others to follow.\r\n\r\nFor comments on W. H. Monk, who adapted the tune, see Hymn 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n108. Alas! and did my Savior bleed              _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nA fine hymn of consecration, published by Watts in his _Hymns and\r\nSpiritual Songs_, 1707, under the title “Godly Sorrow Arising from the\r\nSufferings of Christ.” Dr. Charles S. Robinson states that “more\r\nconversions in Christian biography are credited to this hymn than to any\r\nother.” Fanny Crosby, the blind poet, ten of whose lyrics are found in\r\nthe _Hymnary_, credits this hymn with a share in her conversion. In\r\ntelling the story she says that during a revival in the old Thirtieth\r\nStreet Church, New York, in 1850, several times she sought the Saviour\r\nat the altar; but not until one evening, November 20, did the light\r\ncome. “After a prayer was offered they began to sing the good old\r\nconsecration hymn, ‘Alas! and did my Saviour bleed,’ and when they had\r\nreached the third line of the fourth stanza, ‘Here, Lord, I give myself\r\naway,’ my very soul flooded with celestial light.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MARTYRDOM. The original form of this melody is in common time\r\n(4/4). It appeared in triple time in R. A. Smith’s _Sacred Music sung in\r\nSt. George’s Church_, Edinburgh, 1825, where it was designated “Old\r\nScottish Melody.” In 1827, it appeared in _The Seraph, Selection of\r\nPsalms and Hymns_, edited by J. Robertson and published at Glasgow. In a\r\nfootnote to the tune it is stated that “the above tune ‘Fennich,’ or\r\n‘Martyrdom,’ and by some called ‘Drumclog,’ was composed by Hugh Wilson,\r\na native of Fennick.” A legal dispute arose between Smith and Wilson\r\nover the ownership of the tune. The evidence was abundant to show that\r\nWilson composed it. It is an effective tune. When it was first sung in\r\nSt. George’s, Edinburgh, the minister, Dr. Thomson, said, “O man! I\r\ncould not sing for weeping.”\r\n\r\nHugh Wilson, 1766-1824, the composer of the tune, learned his father’s\r\ntrade of shoemaking, studied and taught mathematics, and made sun-dials\r\nas a hobby. He then held positions of responsibility in certain mills\r\nand afterwards became a draftsman. He was interested in Sunday school\r\nwork and wrote a number of psalm tunes but MARTYRDOM is the only one\r\nfound in modern hymnals.\r\n\r\n\r\n109. Throned upon the awful tree                _John Ellerton_, 1826-93\r\n\r\nA solemn dirge of the Passion, written in 1875 in the seclusion of a\r\nquiet rural parish and regarded as the author’s best composition. It\r\nappeared in _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, 1875.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Ellerton see Hymn 43.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ REDHEAD NO. 76, also called “Petra,” and “Gethsemane,” was\r\ncomposed by Richard Redhead, 1820-1901, English chorister and organist,\r\nand proponent of the Oxford Movement (not to be confused with the modern\r\nOxford movement headed by Buchman). The tune, without name, appeared in\r\nhis _Church Hymns and Tunes, Ancient and Modern_, 1853, as No. 76. In\r\nEngland it has long been sung to the hymn “Rock of Ages, cleft for me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n110. In the Cross of Christ I glory            _John Bowring_, 1792-1872\r\n\r\nThe most popular of John Bowring’s _Hymns_, published in 1825, and a\r\nclassic among the hymns of the cross. It is based on Gal. 6:14: “But God\r\nforbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\nby whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” Bowring\r\ndied on November 23, 1872, and the words, “In the cross of Christ I\r\nglory,” were placed on his tombstone.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that so great a hymn on the cross should be written by\r\na Unitarian, a communion which denies the deity of Jesus and the\r\nevangelical doctrine of the atonement. Yet the hymn can be sung\r\nwhole-heartedly by every evangelical Christian for it magnifies the\r\ncross and makes it the center of the Christian faith. Bowring, in spite\r\nof his Unitarian connection, was a devout, evangelical believer.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on John Bowring see Hymn 55.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ RATHBUN was composed by Ithamar Conkey, 1815-67, an organist\r\nand prominent bass soloist who took part in many oratorio performances\r\nin New York City. The tune was composed one Sunday afternoon after the\r\nminister, Dr. Hiscox, of the Central Baptist Church, Norwich, Conn., had\r\npreached one of a series of sermons on the “Words of the Cross.” Conkey\r\nnamed the tune after the leading soprano in his choir, Mrs. Beriah S.\r\nRathbun.\r\n\r\n\r\n111. Cross of Jesus, Cross of sorrow        _William J. Sparrow Simpson_\r\n\r\nFrom Stainer’s oratorio, _The Crucifixion_, where it appears as No. 4\r\nunder the title, “The Mystery of Divine Humiliation.” The original has\r\n10 stanzas.\r\n\r\nThe libretto of _The Crucifixion_ was written by Wm. J. Sparrow Simpson,\r\nChurch of England clergyman. He was educated at Cambridge, ordained in\r\n1882, and became chaplain of St. Mary’s Hospital, Great Alford. His\r\ntheological works include the _Catholic Conception of the Church_ and\r\nthe _History of the Anglo-Catholic Movement_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CROSS OF JESUS in Stainer’s _Crucifixion_ is intended among\r\nother numbers in the oratorio, “to be sung by the congregation.” Its\r\ndepth of feeling is best realized if sung in rather slow tempo.\r\n\r\nJohn Stainer, 1840-1901, began his career as a choir boy at St. Paul’s\r\nCathedral, London, at the age of seven, continuing there for nine years.\r\nHe early became acquainted with Arthur Sullivan and the two remained\r\nfast friends throughout life. Stainer became one of England’s greatest\r\norganists and succeeded Sir John Goss, at St. Paul’s Cathedral. He was\r\none of the most prolific and best-loved of the Victorian composers. A\r\nbronze tablet, installed in his honor in St. Paul’s, was dedicated by a\r\nservice in which parts of his cantatas were sung, and closed with his\r\n“sevenfold Amen” (623).\r\n\r\n\r\n112. Beneath the Cross of Jesus    _Elizabeth Cecilia Clephane_, 1830-69\r\n\r\nA hymn of Scottish origin, especially appropriate for use in Good Friday\r\nservices, but it can also be used on more general occasions.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Cecilia Douglas Clephane, daughter of the Sheriff of Fife and\r\nKinross, was born in Edinburgh. She was a member of the Free Church of\r\nScotland. Her hymn, “There were ninety and nine,” became widely known\r\nthrough its use by Moody and Sankey in their famous evangelistic\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\nThe hymn, “Beneath the Cross of Jesus,” appeared in Scotland, three\r\nyears after the death of Miss Clephane, in _The Family Treasure_, a home\r\nmagazine, with this explanatory note by the editor:\r\n\r\n  These lines express the experiences, the hopes, and the longings of a\r\n  young Christian lately released. Written on the very edge of this\r\n  life, with the better land fully in view of faith, they seem to us\r\n  footsteps printed on the sands of Time, where those sands touch the\r\n  ocean of Eternity. These footprints of one whom the Good Shepherd led\r\n  through the wilderness into rest, may, with God’s blessing, contribute\r\n  to comfort and direct succeeding pilgrims.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. CHRISTOPHER was composed for this hymn by Frederick C.\r\nMaker, 1844-1927, an English organist and composer of numerous hymn\r\ntunes. Maker spent all his life in Bristol, England, thirty years of\r\nwhich were devoted to the position of organist at the Redland Park\r\nCongregational Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HIS RESURRECTION\r\n\r\n\r\n113. Come ye faithful, raise the strain     _John of Damascus_, _c._ 700\r\n                                                     _Tr. John M. Neale_\r\n\r\nA Greek hymn based on the Song of Moses, Exodus 15.\r\n\r\n  Αἴσωµεν, πάντες λαοί,\r\n  τῶ ἐκ πικρᾶς δουλείας\r\n  Φαραὼ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἀπαλλάξαντι\r\n  καὶ ἐν βυθῷ φαλάσσης\r\n  ποδὶ ἀβρόχως ὁδηγήσαντι\r\n  ᾠδὴν ἐπινίκιον,\r\n  ὅτι δεδόξασται.\r\n\r\n  Σήµερον ἔαρ ψυχῶν,\r\n  ὅτι Χριστὸς ἐκ τάφου,\r\n  ὥσπερ ἥλιος, ἐκλάµψας τριήµερος\r\n  τον ζοφερὸν χειµῶνα\r\n  ἀπήλασε τῆς ἁµαρτίας ἡµῶν,\r\n  αὐτὸν ἀνυµνήσωµεν,\r\n  ὅτι δεδόξασται.\r\n\r\n  Ἡ βασιλὶς τῶν ὡρῶν\r\n  τῆ λαµπροφόρῳ ἡµέρᾳ\r\n  ἡµερῶν τε βασιλίδι φανότατα\r\n  δωροφοροῦσα, τέρπει\r\n  τὸν ἔγκριτον τῆς ἐκκλησίας λαόν,\r\n  ἀπαύστως ἀνυµνοῦσα\r\n  τὸν ἀναστάτα Χριστόν.\r\n\r\n  Πύλαι θανάτου, Χριστέ,\r\n  οὐδὲ τοῦ τάφου σφραγῖδες,\r\n  οὐδὲ κλεῖθρα τῶν θυρῶν Σοι ἀντέστησαν,\r\n  ἀλλ’ ἀναστὰς ἐπέστης\r\n  τοῖς φίλοις σου εἰρήνην, Δέσποτα,\r\n  δωρούµενος τὴν πάντα\r\n  νοῦν ὑπερέχουσαν.\r\n\r\nIt was written by John of Damascus about the middle of the 8th century.\r\n\r\nJohn of Damascus, Greek theologian and distinguished hymnist, as well as\r\nthe greatest scholar and poet of his time, was born in Damascus of a\r\nprominent family, about A.D. 700. He was educated by an Italian monk\r\nnamed Cosmas, and retired to the monastery of St. Sabas in the Holy\r\nLand. He died between 754 and 787. He wrote a number of canons. A canon\r\nin Greek hymnology was a series of odes, usually eight or nine, threaded\r\non an acrostic. This hymn is from his canon for the Sunday after Easter.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, John M. Neale, see Hymn 67.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. KEVIN. The composer, Arthur Sullivan, 1842-1900, was born\r\nin London, the son of an Irish band-master. He received a thorough\r\nmusical education in London and on the continent and became a famous\r\nchoir leader, hymn book editor, conductor, and composer. In\r\ncollaboration with W. S. Gilbert, he composed light operas for which he\r\nis best known.\r\n\r\n\r\n114. Jesus Christ is ris’n today                                 _Latin_\r\n                                               _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nThis hymn, which Percy Dearmer called “the Easter hymn par excellence,”\r\nis based upon some Latin verses of an Easter carol of the 14th century,\r\nexcept verse 4, which is attributed to Charles Wesley. It is of unknown\r\nauthorship, appearing with the tune “Easter Hymn” in a now rare book,\r\n_Lyra Davidica_.\r\n\r\n“Allelujah” is “Hallelujah” with the “H” omitted to soften it.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EASTER HYMN, one of the most famous of all hymn tunes, is from\r\n_Lyra Davidica, or a Collection of Divine Songs and Hymns, partly New\r\nComposed, partly Translated from the High German and Latin Hymns; and\r\nset to easy and pleasant Tunes_, published in London, 1708. The composer\r\nis unknown. The hymn and tune were headed, “The Resurrection.”\r\n\r\n\r\n115. The day of Resurrection                _John of Damascus_, _c._ 700\r\n                                                     _Tr. John M.

It is sung after midnight on Easter morning to set forth the\r\nfact of the resurrection. Julian describes the service in his\r\n_Dictionary of Hymnology_ (p. 62). The people assemble in the church\r\nwith unlighted tapers in their hands. While the priest chants in a half\r\nwhisper, they await the signal that Easter Day has begun. A cannon is\r\nfired when the moment comes, the Cross is raised, and the people cry,\r\n“_Christos anesti_” (Christ is risen.) The tapers are lighted and the\r\nchurch is set ablaze with light. Outside there is the sound of drums and\r\ntrumpets, the people embrace and congratulate each other, and salute one\r\nanother with “_Christos anesti_.”\r\n\r\nThe reference in stanza 2 is to Matt. 28:9: “Jesus met them, saying,\r\n‘All Hail!’”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, John M. Neale, see Hymn 67.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LANCASHIRE, a thrilling tune of steady swing, was composed for\r\n“From Greenland’s icy mountains,” to be used at a missionary meeting at\r\nBlackburn, England. It is also, in some hymn books, used with “Lead on,\r\nO King Eternal” (399).\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Henry Smart, 1813-79, see Hymn 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n116. The strife is o’er, the battle done                         _Latin_\r\n                                           _Tr. Francis Pott_, 1832-1909\r\n\r\n  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\r\n  Finita iam sunt praelia,\r\n  Est parta iam victoria;\r\n  Gaudeamus et canamus:\r\n        Alleluia!\r\n\r\n  Post fata mortis barbara\r\n  Devicit Iesus tartara;\r\n  Applaudamus et psallamus:\r\n        Alleluia!\r\n\r\n  Surrexit die tertia\r\n  Caelesti clarus gratia\r\n  Insonemus et cantemus:\r\n        Alleluia!\r\n\r\n  Sunt clausa stygis ostia.\r\n  Et caeli patent atria;\r\n  Gaudeamus et canamus:\r\n        Alleluia!\r\n\r\n  Per tua, Iesu, vulnera\r\n  Nos mala morte libera,\r\n  Ut vivamus et canamus:\r\n        Alleluia! Amen.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated of Easter hymns. It comes from an anonymous\r\nmedieval Latin poem which appeared in the Jesuit _Symphonia Sirenum_,\r\nCologne, 1695.\r\n\r\nThe translation is by Francis Pott, an Englishman. He was educated at\r\nOxford University and after serving a long number of years as curate and\r\nrector in various churches, he retired on account of increasing\r\ndeafness. Pott published several volumes of hymns and wrote a book on\r\nthe “_Te Deum_.” He was a member of the original committee which\r\nproduced _Hymns Ancient and Modern_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ VICTORY, also called “Palestrina,” is an adaptation from the\r\n“Gloria Patri” of a work called, _Magnificat Tertii Toni_, 1591, by the\r\neminent Italian composer, Giovanni Pierluigi Sante Da Palestrina,\r\n1525-94.\r\n\r\nThe present arrangement was made by Wm. H. Monk for this hymn.\r\n\r\nPalestrina, foremost composer of the Roman Catholic Church and supreme\r\nmaster of polyphonic music, was born at Palestrina, Italy, the son of a\r\nwealthy peasant, Pierluigi Sante. He was named “Da Palestrina” after his\r\nbirthplace, a common custom in his time. He received his musical\r\ntraining at Rome where he came under the powerful influence of Orlando\r\ndi Lasso, the great master from the Netherlands. Palestrina served as\r\nchapelmaster in his home town, master of the boys in the Julian Chapel\r\nin Rome, and in 1555 was appointed one of the pontifical singers in the\r\nSistine Chapel but was dismissed a few months later when he became\r\nguilty of the “crime” of matrimony. He then became chapelmaster at St.\r\nJohn Lateran and later of the Liberian Chapel of Santa Maria Maggiore,\r\nduring which time he became known as “the saviour of church music.” Many\r\nabuses had crept into the music of the church, particularly in the use\r\nof secular airs grafted on stately church themes, and improvizations by\r\nthe singers who sometimes departed from the solemn words of the service\r\nand substituted profane and lewd words in Italian and French. To correct\r\nthis scandal, the Ecumenical Council of Trent, in 1552, asked Palestrina\r\nto prepare a mass free from the admixture of alien words and secular\r\nmelodies, and suitable for church use. The result was the composition of\r\nthree 6-part services, one of which, _Missa Papae Marcelli_, has been\r\nregarded as one of the most sublime creations of all music and the model\r\nof what church music should be. As a reward for this service, Palestrina\r\nwas granted a stipend by papal decree which was not large but gave him a\r\nsufficient income. In 1571 he was re-elected to his old post as\r\nChapelmaster of St. Peter’s, where he remained for life. His fame as\r\nteacher and composer extended throughout Europe, but his happiness was\r\nclouded by the loss of two sons and the death of his wife in 1580, while\r\nthe remaining son, Igino, became a source of grief to him. Palestrina’s\r\ncompositions were many and of great variety, including 93 masses, 179\r\nmotets, hymns, prayers, responses, madrigals, etc.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Monk see Hymn 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HIS ASCENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n117. Hail the day that sees Him rise           _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nThis hymn, originally in ten stanzas, appeared in Wesley’s _Hymns and\r\nSacred Poems_, 1739, under the caption “For Ascension Day.” The\r\nHallelujah was added later in White’s _Introits and Hymns_, 1852.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LLANFAIR, also named “Bethel,” is a Welsh hymn tune by Robert\r\nWilliams, c. 1781-1821, a basket maker. He was born blind, but became a\r\nskilled craftsman and a musician of considerable ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n118. Crown Him with many crowns               _Matthew Bridges_, 1800-94\r\n\r\nBased on Rev. 19:12: “On his head were many crowns.” The hymn mentions a\r\nfour-fold crowning of Christ, as: (1) Lamb upon His throne; (2) Son of\r\nGod; (3) Lord of life; (4) Lord of heaven. Two omitted stanzas mention\r\n“Lord of peace,” and “Lord of years.”\r\n\r\nMatthew Bridges was brought up in the church of England but became\r\ninterested in the Oxford Movement and entered the Roman Catholic Church\r\nin 1848. He was a student of history and wrote _The Roman Empire under\r\nConstantine the Great_. He is also the author of several books of poems.\r\nThe latter part of his life was spent in the Province of Quebec, Canada.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was recast by Godfrey Thring to eliminate several obvious Roman\r\ntendencies in it.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DIADEMATA, a solid, dignified tune which organists like to play\r\nand congregations enjoy singing, was written for this hymn and named\r\nafter the Latin title given the hymn.\r\n\r\nThe composer, George Job Elvey, 1816-93, was a gifted organist and\r\ncomposer and a devout Christian. He received the Bachelor of Music and\r\nDoctorate in Music from Oxford University and was organist of St.\r\nGeorge’s Chapel, Windsor, for 47 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n119. Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious    _Thomas Kelly_, 1769-1854\r\n\r\nA majestic coronation hymn ranking with the best hymns of Watts and\r\nWesley. It is based on Rev. 11:15: “The kingdoms of this world are\r\nbecome the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ. And he shall reign\r\nforever and ever.”\r\n\r\nThomas Kelly was born in Dublin, the son of an Irish judge. He at first\r\nintended to follow his father into the legal profession, but his\r\nprofound religious convictions led him to train for the ministry. As a\r\nyoung clergyman, he was summoned, with others, to appear before the\r\nArchbishop of Dublin to answer for his evangelistic zeal. He was rebuked\r\nand prohibited from preaching in Dublin pulpits. He then withdrew from\r\nthe Church of England and started a number of independent churches. He\r\nwas much interested in the hymnody of the church and wrote 736 hymns in\r\nall. They are characterized by loyalty to Jesus Christ and a deep\r\nevangelical glow.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CORONAE is a virile tune, written in 1871, and well adapted by\r\nits voice range for congregational singing.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Wm. H. Monk, see Hymn 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n120. Majestic sweetness sits enthroned   _Samuel Stennett_, _c._ 1727-95\r\n\r\nThis hymn was published in John Rippon’s _Selection_, 1787, with the\r\ntitle, “Chief among Ten Thousand: or the Excellencies of Christ.” It is\r\nbased on Song of Solomon 5:10-16. The original has 9 stanzas.\r\n\r\nThe author, Samuel Stennett, prominent non-conformist and champion of\r\nreligious freedom, was a Baptist clergyman who in 1741 became his\r\nfather’s assistant in Little Wild Street Church, London, and then\r\nsucceeded his father in 1758, continuing in the pastorate of the church\r\nuntil his death in 1795.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ORTONVILLE has been a favorite hymn tune for over a century. It\r\nis associated with these words now, but at first it was set to “O for a\r\ncloser walk with God.” Among Hastings’ tunes, this is second in\r\npopularity to “Toplady” (148), the tune he made for “Rock of Ages.”\r\n\r\nThos. Hastings, 1784-1872, was born in Connecticut, moved to New York\r\nstate to farm but left the farm at the age of 33 to devote himself to\r\nmusic. In 1831 he moved to New York City to serve the musical interests\r\nof a group of churches. He wrote 600 hymns and about 1,000 hymn tunes.\r\nHe published 50 books of music and collaborated with Lowell Mason in\r\n_Spiritual Songs for Social Worship_. The University of the City of New\r\nYork gave him the degree of Doctor of Music in 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n121. Rejoice, the Lord is King                 _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nA jubilant song of Christ’s exaltation and coming in power, based on\r\nPhil. 4:4: “Rejoice in the Lord alway, and again I say, rejoice.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn, in seven stanzas, appeared first in John Wesley’s _Sacred and\r\nMoral Poems_, 1744, and later in Wesley’s _Hymns for our Lord’s\r\nResurrection_, 1746. Though the resurrection note is in the hymn, it is\r\nappropriate also for general occasions.\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley wrote four great festival hymns: (1) “Hark! the herald\r\nangels sing” for Christmas; (2) “Christ the Lord is risen today” for\r\nEaster; (3) “Hail the day that sees Him rise” for Ascension; and (4)\r\n“Rejoice, the Lord is king” for Whitsuntide.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ARTHUR’S SEAT appeared in _Hymns and Songs of Praise_ 1874, by\r\nJohn K. Paine and Uzziah C. Burnap. The tune is believed to be an\r\narrangement by Burnap from a melody composed by Sir John Goss, 1800-80,\r\nEnglish organist and composer of church choir music. Handel composed a\r\ntune, “Gopsal,” especially for this hymn, but it is not well known and\r\nhas not found its way into many of the hymn books.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Paine and Burnap see Hymn 134.\r\n\r\n\r\n122. Hail, Thou once despisèd Jesus!          _John Bakewell_, 1721-1819\r\n\r\nA worshipful and strongly doctrinal hymn, bringing out plainly the\r\ndoctrine of the atonement as well as the Saviour’s enthronement and\r\nglorification.\r\n\r\nThe authorship is traditionally assigned to John Bakewell, one of John\r\nWesley’s lay preachers. But it is not clear that he wrote all of it. It\r\nappeared in 1760 in a collection by M. Madan, and later, in 1776, it was\r\nincluded in _Psalms and Hymns_ by Augustus M. Toplady. Both editors\r\napparently made some changes and omissions in the hymn, resulting in our\r\npresent version.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ IN BABILONE is a Dutch traditional melody, its present\r\narrangement having been made by Professor Julius Röntgen, 1855-1933, of\r\nAmsterdam. It appeared in _The English Hymnal_ in 1906 and has since won\r\nits way into many American hymn books. It is a joyous, robust melody\r\nwell suited to carry this hymn.\r\n\r\n\r\n123. Hark, ten thousand harps and voices       _Thomas Kelly_, 1769-1854\r\n\r\nBased on Heb. 1:6: “Let all the angels of God worship Him.”\r\n\r\nThe original poem has 7 stanzas. Lowell Mason added the “Hallelujahs”\r\nand the “Amen” when he set the hymn to music. Some hymn books have\r\nsoftened the “Hallelujah” to “Allelujah.” The last stanza is a prayer\r\nfor the hastening of the day when heaven and earth shall pass away,\r\nwhich some may not be able to sing heartily and sincerely.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Thomas Kelly see Hymn 119.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HARWELL was written for this hymn in 1840. The original version\r\nhad the men’s voices introduce lines 5 and 6 with a dotted eighth and a\r\nsixteenth note, in unison, while the soprano and altos observed a\r\nquarter rest. Later editing changed the tune so all the parts observed\r\nthe quarter rest.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Lowell Mason, see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n124. Alleluia! sing to Jesus!                  _William C. Dix_, 1837-98\r\n\r\nBased on Rev. 5:9: “Thou hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of\r\nevery nation.”\r\n\r\nThe original poem of five stanzas appeared in Dix’s _Altar Songs_, 1867,\r\nand was entitled “Redemption by the Precious Blood.” The hymn was linked\r\nto the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper. The third and fourth stanzas,\r\nomitted here, are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Alleluia! Bread of Heaven,\r\n    Thou on earth our food, our stay!\r\n  Alleluia! here the sinful\r\n    Flee to thee from day to day:\r\n  Intercessor, friend of sinners,\r\n    Earth’s Redeemer, plead for me,\r\n  Where the songs of all the sinless,\r\n    Sweep across the crystal sea.\r\n\r\n  Alleluia! King eternal,\r\n    Thee the Lord of lords we own:\r\n  Alleluia! born of Mary,\r\n    Earth thy footstool, heav’n thy throne:\r\n  Thou within the veil hast entered,\r\n    Robed in flesh, our great High Priest:\r\n  Thou on earth both Priest and Victim\r\n    In the eucharistic feast.\r\n\r\nFor comments on William C. Dix see Hymn 78.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune was taken from _St. Basil’s Hymnal_, Chicago, 1918,\r\nwhere it appears unnamed. It is a traditional Dutch melody. The present\r\narrangement of it is anonymous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HIS COMING AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n125. The King shall come when morning dawns             _From the Greek_\r\n                                       _Tr. by John Brownlie_, 1859-1925\r\n\r\nThis hymn, setting forth the hope of Christ’s Second Coming in triumph,\r\ncomes from the Greek, but no information is at hand concerning the\r\noriginal poem. It is not included in Julian’s _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\nThe translation is by John Brownlie, a Scottish minister, born in\r\nGlasgow. He published several books of original hymns and translations\r\nfrom the Greek.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ JERUSALEM, JERUSALEM is wrongly attributed here to Thomas\r\nHastings though it is possible that the arrangement is his. The same\r\ntune, named “St. Michel’s,” appears at No. 93, which see for comments.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Thomas Hastings see Hymn 120.\r\n\r\n\r\n126. Thou art coming, O my Savior         _Frances R. Havergal_, 1836-79\r\n\r\nThe first hymn Miss Havergal wrote after Advent Sunday, December 2,\r\n1873, when she “first saw clearly the blessedness of true consecration.”\r\n\r\nFrances Ridley Havergal was the daughter of Rev. Wm. H. Havergal, an\r\nAnglican clergyman who was greatly interested in the hymns and music of\r\nthe church and composed a number of tunes still in use. His tune,\r\n“Evan,” is used in the _Hymnary_ (153 and 253). Frances thus grew up in\r\na cultured religious environment in which hymns and church music held a\r\nprominent place. She was handicapped by a frail body and died at the\r\nearly age of forty-three. But throughout her short life, from the time\r\nof her confirmation at seventeen until the end, she had an unbounded joy\r\nin Christian service. No suffering could diminish her faith in the grace\r\nof God through Jesus Christ. Despite her poor health, she was a devoted\r\nstudent of the Bible and was able to repeat from memory the four\r\nGospels, the Epistles, Revelations, all the Psalms, Isaiah, and the\r\nMinor Prophets. Besides writing many letters counselling those who\r\nsought her advice, she wrote devotional books and composed sacred hymns\r\nand poems, always emphasizing consecration and service. She made a\r\nconsiderable contribution to the hymnody of the church. Six of her\r\ncompositions are to be found in the _Hymnary_ (126, 190, 215, 219, 296,\r\n380).\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BEVERLEY was composed for this hymn for use in _Hymns Ancient\r\nand Modern_, Rev. ed., 1875.\r\n\r\nFor comments on W. H. Monk see Hymn 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n127. Christ is coming, let creation           _John R. Macduff_, 1818-95\r\n\r\nA Scottish hymn setting forth the glowing hope and expectation of the\r\ncoming of Christ in glory. It is based on Rev. 22:20: “He which\r\ntestifieth these things saith, Surely, I come quickly. Amen. Even so,\r\ncome, Lord Jesus.”\r\n\r\nJohn R. Macduff was minister of the Sandyford Parish, Glasgow. He is the\r\nauthor of several books of devotions and wrote numerous hymns. His\r\nministry at Sandyford was singularly fruitful. George Mattheson, blind\r\nScottish preacher, then a boy in Macduff’s congregation, afterwards said\r\nof him: “Dr. Macduff gave me my first real conviction of the beauty of\r\nChristianity.” Macduff held strongly to the premillennial view of the\r\ncoming of Christ.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NEANDER. This famous tune has been associated with various\r\nwords. The composer first published it in 1680 set to the hymn, “_Unser\r\nHerrscher, unser König_.” It is also used with Schmolk’s “Open now the\r\ngates of beauty” (505), and in England it is almost invariably\r\nassociated with “Come, ye saints, and raise an anthem,” by J. Hupton and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nJoachim Neander, 1650-80, whose real name was Neumann, was born at\r\nBremen, where he spent most of his life. As a youth he was somewhat wild\r\nbut in time became converted and associated himself with the Pietists of\r\nGermany. He was a friend of Spener, the leader of the Pietists. His\r\nunconventional zeal brought him into conflict with the authorities of\r\nthe Reformed Church of which he was a member, and he was dismissed for a\r\ntime from his office as teacher in the Düsseldorf schools. Being obliged\r\nto leave town, he lived for some months in a cave in the region of the\r\nRhine, where he composed many of his hymns. He is the foremost hymn\r\nwriter of the German Reformed Church and is called “the Paul Gerhardt of\r\nthe Calvinists.” Neander, like Luther, was a man of scholarship and\r\naccomplishment in poetry and music, as well as theology. He wrote more\r\nthan 60 hymns and composed tunes for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n128. Ye servants of the Lord                 _Philip Doddridge_, 1702-51\r\n\r\n“The Active Christian” is the author’s title of this hymn. It appeared\r\nfirst in Job Orton’s posthumous edition of _Hymns founded on Various\r\nTexts_, 1755. It is founded on Luke 12:35-37:\r\n\r\n  Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;\r\n\r\n  And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will\r\n  return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may\r\n  open unto him immediately.\r\n\r\n  Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find\r\n  watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make\r\n  them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.\r\n\r\nDoddridge, known for his sound learning and genuine Christian character,\r\nwas a first-rate hymn writer. He taught Hebrew, Greek, algebra,\r\ntrigonometry, logic, philosophy, and theology to classes of candidates\r\nfor the Congregational ministry.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Doddridge see Hymn 56.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ OLD 134TH (ST. MICHAEL) is one of the greatest of short-meter\r\ntunes, derived from the tune composed by L. Bourgeois for Psalm 101 in\r\nthe _Genevan Psalter_ of 1551.\r\n\r\nFor comments on L. Bourgeois see Hymn 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n129. Come, Lord, and tarry not                 _Horatius Bonar_, 1808-89\r\n\r\nA plaintive, sad hymn bordering almost on pessimism, by an able, pious\r\nauthor who held the doctrine of the premillenarian coming of Christ. All\r\nhis life, Bonar’s mind was occupied with the subject of the second\r\nadvent, an interest which inspired much of his writing.\r\n\r\nHoratius Bonar, born in Edinburgh, was the prince of Scottish hymn\r\nwriters. Educated at the University of Edinburgh, he was ordained in\r\n1837 and became a minister in the Established Church of Scotland at\r\nKelso. At the Disruption in 1843, Bonar “came out” and was one of the\r\nfounders of the Free Church of Scotland (Presbyterian). Leaving Kelso,\r\nhe became the minister of Chalmer’s Memorial Church in Edinburgh, where\r\nhe served, a greatly beloved man, until his death. He was known as a man\r\nof wide scholarship and culture. His mind was saturated with Scripture\r\nand his heart possessed by a broad and generous faith.\r\n\r\nHis son, Rev. H. N. Bonar, wrote his father’s _Life_ which gives some\r\ninteresting information concerning his hymn writing. Bonar carried\r\nnotebooks with him in which he jotted thoughts, verses, and hymns as\r\nthey came to his mind.\r\n\r\n“These notebooks,” writes the son, “contain most of the better-known\r\nhymns, hastily written down in pencil in his spare moments. They are\r\nfull of contractions, with an occasional word or phrase in shorthand;\r\nsometimes a line is struck out and another substituted, yet in nearly\r\nevery case the complete hymn, almost as it was afterwards published, can\r\nbe gleaned from this rough draft.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SHIRLAND was composed by Samuel Stanley, 1767-1822, English\r\ncomposer and precentor of Carr’s Lane Congregational Chapel, in\r\nBirmingham. Through his skilled leadership the music of this church\r\nbecame famous. The hymn singing attracted attention and resulted in a\r\ngreat growth in the congregation.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Stanley see Hymn 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n130. Lo, He comes, with clouds descending        _John Cennick_, 1718-55\r\n\r\nA hymn on the Second Advent, based on Rev. 1:7: “Behold He cometh with\r\nclouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him:\r\nand all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.”\r\n\r\nThe author, John Cennick, came from a Quaker family though he grew up in\r\nthe Church of England. For some years his religious convictions were\r\nunsettled. Then while engaged in land surveying, he came under the\r\ninfluence of Wesley and became one of his lay preachers. Later he became\r\na follower of George Whitefield, and finally he joined the Moravians.\r\nWhile limited in culture and outlook, he possessed genuine lyric fire;\r\nand his name is of note among the hymnists, even though only a few of\r\nhis many hymns survive.\r\n\r\nThis hymn has been much revised. It owes not a little to Charles Wesley\r\nwho changed Cennick’s first line, “Lo! he cometh; countless trumpets,”\r\nto the familiar “Lo, He comes with clouds descending.” Martin Madan, who\r\nissued the hymn in his _Collection of Psalms and Hymns_, also gave it\r\ncertain finishing touches. The hymn possesses a scriptural vividness and\r\nimpressive treatment of theme which have carried it throughout the\r\nEnglish speaking world, despite the apocalyptic form of the description\r\nit sets forth.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HOLYWOOD is attributed to Samuel Webbe, probably the elder,\r\n1740-1816, a London organist and composer and a member of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church. His son, Samuel Webbe, Jr., 1770-1843, following his\r\nfather in the musical profession, likewise became an organist and\r\ncomposer.\r\n\r\nIts solidity and triumphant note give this tune a worthy place in the\r\nmusic of the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE HOLY SPIRIT\r\n\r\n\r\n131. Come, Holy Ghost, in love                     _Ray Palmer_, 1808-87\r\n                                                    _Tr. from the Latin_\r\n\r\n  Veni, Sancte Spiritus,\r\n  Et emitte caelitus\r\n    Lucis tuae radium:\r\n  Veni, Pater pauperum;\r\n  Veni, Dator munerum;\r\n    Veni, Lumen cordium.\r\n\r\n  Consolator optime,\r\n  Dulcis Hospes animae,\r\n    Duce Refrigerium,\r\n  In labore Requies,\r\n  In aestu Temperies,\r\n    In fletu Solacium.\r\n\r\n  O Lux beatissima,\r\n  Reple cordis intima\r\n    Tuorum fidelium.\r\n  Sine tuo numine\r\n  Nihil est in homine.\r\n    Nihil est innoxium.\r\n\r\n  Lava, quod est sordidum,\r\n  Riga, quod est aridum,\r\n    Rege, quod est devium,\r\n  Fove, quod est languidum,\r\n  Flecte, quod est rigidum,\r\n    Sana, quod est saucium.\r\n\r\n  Da tuis fidelibus\r\n  In te confidentibus\r\n    Sacrum septenarium;\r\n  Da virtutis meritum,\r\n  Da salutis exitum,\r\n    Da perenne gaudium. Amen.\r\n\r\nThis truly great Latin hymn, addressed to the Holy Spirit, comes from\r\nthe 12th or 13th century. Its authorship is uncertain. Archbishop Trench\r\ncharacterized it as “the loveliest of all the hymns in the whole cycle\r\nof Sacred Latin Poetry.” Many translations have been made of it, this\r\none by Ray Palmer.\r\n\r\nRay Palmer, who held pastorates at Bath, Me., and Albany, N. Y., was for\r\na time corresponding secretary for the American Congregational Union.\r\nHis name remains the greatest among hymnists and translators in the\r\nAmerican Congregational church. His hymn, “My faith looks up to Thee”\r\n(150), is known all over the world.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MALVERN is from _The Hallelujah_, a series of compilations of\r\ntunes, edited by J. J. Waite and H. J. Gauntlett, first published in\r\n1842. The work was intended to encourage the congregation to sing in\r\nparts, an altogether novel principle in the English churches of that\r\ntime. To make the music easy to read, the notes were numbered, the tonic\r\nsol-fa system having, as yet, not been developed. The present\r\narrangement is by John Roberts, 1822-77, Welsh Methodist pastor and\r\nmusician of extraordinary ability. He did much to improve congregational\r\nsinging in the church and was an eminent conductor of school music\r\nfestivals. Roberts wrote a number of tunes that are high in favor\r\nthroughout Wales and was incomparable as an arranger of congregational\r\nhymn tunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n132. Lord God, the Holy Ghost              _James Montgomery_, 1771-1854\r\n\r\nOne of the few hymns which deals distinctively with the Day of\r\nPentecost. For this reason, as well as for its inherent quality, it is\r\nespecially valuable.\r\n\r\nFor comments on James Montgomery see Hymn 62.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ OLD 134TH. For comments on this tune see Hymn 128.\r\n\r\n\r\n133. Spirit of God, descend upon my heart      _George Croly_, 1780-1860\r\n\r\nBased on Gal. 5:25: “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the\r\nSpirit.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Croly was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. After ministering\r\nin Ireland for a number of years, he went to London to engage in\r\nliterary pursuits. He had varied talents and became well known for his\r\npoetry, fiction, plays, and contributed articles to magazines. In 1835,\r\nhe entered parish work in London, where he was greatly admired and\r\nloved. His outspoken utterances attracted large congregations of all\r\nranks to his church. He prepared, at the request of his people, a\r\ncollection of _Psalms and Hymns for Public Worship_, of which only one\r\nedition was printed. Dr. Croly dropped dead while walking one day on\r\nHolborn Street. A man of scholarship and culture, and author of many\r\nvolumes, he is remembered chiefly through this hymn.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MORECAMBE, originally called “Hellespont,” was written to be\r\nsung with “Abide with me,” for use in the church at Mannington, England,\r\nwhere its composer was serving as organist.\r\n\r\nFrederick Cook Atkinson, 1841-97, was an English organist and\r\nchoirmaster, having received his musical education at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n134. Holy Ghost, dispel our sadness             _Paul Gerhardt_, 1607-76\r\n\r\nA hymn of entreaty for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe original is as follows:\r\n\r\n  O Du allersüsste Freude,\r\n    O Du allerschönstes Licht,\r\n  Der Du uns in Lieb und Leide\r\n    Unbesuchet lässest nicht;\r\n  Geist des Höchsten, höchster Fürst\r\n  Der Du hältst und halten wirst\r\n    Ohn’ Aufhören alle Dinge\r\n    Höre, höre, was ich singe.\r\n\r\n  Du bist ja die beste Gabe\r\n    Die ein Mensch nur nennen kann;\r\n  Wenn ich Dich erwünsch’ und habe,\r\n    Geb’ ich alles Wünschen d’ran.\r\n  Ach, ergib Dich, komm zu mir,\r\n  In mein Herze, das Du Dir,\r\n    Eh ich in die Welt geboren\r\n    Selbst zum Tempel auserkoren.\r\n\r\n  Sei mein Retter, führ’ mich eben;\r\n    Wenn ich sink’, mein Stab sei Du;\r\n  Wenn ich sterbe, sei mein Leben;\r\n    Wenn ich lieg’, sei meine Ruh;\r\n  Wenn ich wieder aufersteh’,\r\n  O so hilf mir, dass ich geh\r\n    Hin, da Du in ew’gen Freuden\r\n    Wirst die Auserwählten weiden.\r\n\r\nThe first translation was made by John Christian Jacobi, 1670-1750, for\r\nhis _Psalmodia Germanica_. His rendering began\r\n\r\n  “O Thou sweetest source of gladness”\r\n\r\nwhich Augustus Montague Toplady recast into the familiar\r\n\r\n  “Holy Ghost, dispel our sadness.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Toplady see Hymn 148.\r\n\r\nPaul Gerhardt, next to Martin Luther, is the most noteworthy hymn writer\r\nof the Evangelical Church in Germany. Even the hymns of Luther are not\r\nas widely used today in the English speaking world as those of Gerhardt.\r\nHe was born March 12, 1607, in Gräfenhynichen, a village near the\r\ncelebrated Wittenberg. At 21 he began the study of theology in\r\nWittenberg, but he received no church position until 45, when he was\r\nordained and appointed provost at Mittenwalde, a small village. During\r\nhis six years there, his hymns were published and he became widely\r\nknown. In 1657, he was appointed third assistant pastor of the famous\r\nChurch of St. Nicholas in Berlin. From this position he was deposed\r\nbecause he refused to sign a document promising that all clergymen would\r\nabstain from any references in their sermons to doctrinal differences\r\nbetween the Lutherans and Calvinists. Though he felt the blow keenly, he\r\nmet it with Christian patience and fortitude. “This,” he said, “is only\r\na small Berlin affliction; but I am also willing and ready to seal with\r\nmy blood the evangelical truth, and, like my namesake, St. Paul, to\r\noffer my neck to the sword.” Additional sorrows came into his life with\r\nthe death of his wife and four of his children. He was left with a\r\nsingle child, a boy of six, when he was called to the church at Lübden,\r\nwhere he labored faithfully and successfully until his death on June 7,\r\n1676. Most of his life being spent in the distractions and disasters of\r\nthe Thirty Years War, which left Germany in misery and ruins, Gerhardt\r\nknew the depths of human sorrow. Out of the depths came his hymns of\r\ncomfort and hope which have been a source of strength to a multitude of\r\nbelievers.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ INVOCATION was composed by Uzziah C. Burnap, 1834-1900,\r\norganist at the Church of the Heights, Brooklyn, and co-editor with John\r\nK. Paine, Professor of Music at Harvard, of _Hymns and Songs of Praise_.\r\n\r\n\r\n135. Breathe on me, breath of God                 _Edwin Hatch_, 1835-89\r\n\r\nAn earnest prayer for an inbreathing of the Holy Spirit and a greater\r\nconsecration of life. The hymn was first published in a privately\r\nprinted leaflet called, _Between Doubt and Prayer_, 1878. It is based on\r\nJohn 20:22: “He breathed on them and saith unto them, Receive ye the\r\nHoly Ghost.”\r\n\r\nEdwin Hatch, Church of England clergyman and University Reader of\r\nEcclesiastical History at Oxford, was a scholar of world reputation. His\r\nBampton Lectures, _The Organization of the Early Christian Church_,\r\n1881, were translated into German by Prof. Adolph Harnack, who wrote of\r\nHatch: “In his learning that of England’s great old theologians, Ussher\r\nand Pearson, lived to me again. He was a glorious man, whose loss I\r\nshall never cease to mourn.” Though a man of profound learning, his\r\nfaith was as simple and unaffected as that of a child.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ TRENTHAM is a tune of great beauty, well fitted for these words\r\nof devotion. The tenor part is especially melodious.\r\n\r\nRobert Jackson, 1840-1914, English composer of many anthems, hymn tunes,\r\nsongs and part songs, succeeded his father as organist and choirmaster\r\nat St. Peter’s church, Oldham, the father and son together having a\r\nrecord of continuous service at the same church for 92 years. His whole\r\nlife was devoted to music. He was a member of Sir Charles Halle’s\r\norchestra and conductor of the Oldham Musical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n136. Holy Spirit, Truth divine              _Samuel Longfellow_, 1819-92\r\n\r\nEntitled a “Prayer for Inspiration,” this superb hymn of the Holy Spirit\r\nappeared in _Hymns of the Spirit_, 1864, edited by Samuel Johnson and\r\nthe author. Stanzas 5 and 6 are omitted.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Samuel Longfellow see Hymn 28.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MERCY is an arrangement of a piano composition called, “The\r\nLast Hope,” by Louis Gottschalk, 1829-69, American composer, conductor,\r\nand popular concert pianist. Among Gottschalk’s works are two operas,\r\ntwo symphonies, and some piano pieces and songs—most of which are\r\nforgotten today. The arrangement of the tune is the work of Dr. Edwin P.\r\nParker, 1836-1925, hymnologist and distinguished Congregationalist\r\nminister at Hartford, Conn.\r\n\r\n\r\n137. Holy Spirit, faithful Guide              _Marcus M. Wells_, 1815-95\r\n\r\nThe hymn and tune were written by Marcus M. Wells, a farmer and maker of\r\nfarm implements who lived all his life in New York State. Born at\r\nOtsego, N. Y., he was converted in a mission at Buffalo. Regarding the\r\norigin of the hymn and tune he wrote:\r\n\r\n  On a Saturday afternoon, Oct. 1858, while at work in my cornfield, the\r\n  sentiment of the hymn came to me. The next day, Sunday, being a very\r\n  stormy day, I finished the hymn and wrote a tune for it and sent it to\r\n  Prof. I. B. Woodbury.\r\n\r\nThe hymn sets forth God as a Presence, near the Christian’s side,\r\nfriendly and helpful and true, guiding him through the storms and floods\r\nand desert wastes of his pilgrimage from earth to his heavenly home. It\r\nwas first published in the _New York Musical Pioneer_, edited by Isaac\r\nB. Woodbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n138. Our blest Redeemer, ere He breathed      _Harriet Auber_, 1773-1862\r\n\r\nOne of the finest of our hymns on the Holy Spirit. It was written for\r\nWhitsunday and published in the author’s _The Spirit of the Psalms_,\r\n1829, in seven stanzas, the second and third being omitted here. The\r\nhymn appears in most modern hymnals and has been translated into several\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nHarriet Auber, whose grandfather went from Normandy to England in 1685\r\nas a Huguenot refugee, was born in London. She was a woman of refinement\r\nand culture who spent most of her life in the quiet villages of\r\nBroxbourne and Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire. She wrote numerous poems and\r\nhymns, but her name survives as the author of this exquisite lyric.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. CUTHBERT was composed for these words by J. B. Dykes for\r\nthe original edition of _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, 1861.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Dykes see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n139. Spirit divine, attend our prayer           _Andrew Reed_, 1787-1862\r\n                                            _Samuel Longfellow_, 1819-92\r\n\r\nThis is a revision by Samuel Longfellow of a hymn written by Andrew\r\nReed, an English Congregational minister. Reed, a philanthropist and\r\ngreat organizer, and founder of six asylums and orphanages, wrote 21\r\nhymns and published several hymn books. He was an ardent supporter of\r\nmissionary work at home and abroad. Writing to his son who suggested\r\nthat the father should write his autobiography, Dr. Reed summed up his\r\nown life in these words:\r\n\r\n  I was born yesterday, I shall die tomorrow, and I must not spend today\r\n  in telling what I have done, but in doing what I may for HIM who has\r\n  done all for me. I sprang from the people, I have lived for the\r\n  people—the most for the most unhappy; and the people when they know it\r\n  will not suffer me to die out of loving remembrance.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BRECON. The origin of this tune has not been traced. It is a\r\nuseful tune as a choir response after the prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE CHRISTIAN LIFE—THE CALL OF CHRIST\r\n\r\n\r\n140. Jesus calls us o’er the tumult   _Cecil Frances Alexander_, 1823-95\r\n\r\nA hymn of consecration which has had far-reaching influence especially\r\nover young people. It is based on Matt. 4:18, 19: “And Jesus, walking by\r\nthe sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon, called Peter, and Andrew,\r\nhis brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. And he\r\nsaith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” There\r\nis also a reference to the incident by the lake recorded in John 21:15:\r\n“So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, son of Jonas,\r\nlovest thou me more than these?”\r\n\r\nThe hymn appeared first in _Hymns_, 1852, published by the Society for\r\nthe Promotion of Christian Knowledge. In the Episcopal Church in the\r\nUnited States and Canada, it has been adopted as the hymn of the\r\nBrotherhood of St. Andrew.\r\n\r\nMrs. Alexander is known principally as a writer of children’s hymns (410\r\nand 412), but she also contributed excellent church songs for adults.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Mrs. Alexander see Hymn 104.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GALILEE was written for this hymn by William H. Jude,\r\n1852-1922, English organist, composer, and lecturer on musical subjects.\r\nThe tune becomes waltz-like when sung in quick tempo. Recognizing this\r\ndanger, some hymn books are using other tunes with this hymn.\r\n\r\n\r\n141. Behold a stranger at the door               _Joseph Grigg_, 1720-68\r\n\r\nA lyric revealing in a remarkable manner the tenderness and love of\r\nChrist. It is based on Rev. 3:20: “Behold, I stand at the door and\r\nknock.” Bishop How’s hymn, “O Jesus Thou art standing” (144), with which\r\nthis may be compared, is based on the same passage.\r\n\r\nJoseph Grigg, an English Presbyterian minister, began writing hymns when\r\nonly ten years old. After a brief pastorate, he retired from the active\r\nministry to devote himself to literary work. He published about 40\r\nvolumes, including several collections of hymns. Only two of his 43\r\nhymns are found in modern hymnals, this one and “Jesus, and shall it\r\never be” (192), the latter written when he was only ten years of age.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BERA, a very useful tune, was composed by John Edgar Gould,\r\n1822-75, an American musical editor, dealer in musical instruments,\r\nchoral conductor, and publisher of music books. He was born in Maine,\r\nbut spent most of his adult life in New York City and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\n142. I heard the voice of Jesus say            _Horatius Bonar_, 1808-89\r\n\r\nBased on John 1:16: “Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for\r\ngrace,” and originally published with the title, “The Voice from\r\nGalilee.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn is constructed on three sayings of Jesus: (1) “Come unto me,\r\nall ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,” Mt.\r\n11:28; (2) “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give shall\r\nnever thirst,” John 4:14; (3) “I am the light of the world; he that\r\nfolloweth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of\r\nlife.” John 8:12. In the hymn, these three sayings, blended into a\r\nperfect unity, have sounded down the ages by the “Voice from Galilee.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn, as C. S. Robinson reminds us, employs the personal pronoun to\r\nemphasize the intimate relationship between Christ and the individual.\r\n“Christ says, ‘Come to _me_,’ and the Christian says, ‘_I_ come.’ Christ\r\nsays, ‘_I_ give the living water’; and the listener answers, ‘_My_\r\nthirst was quenched’; Christ says, ‘I am the light’; and the child of\r\nGod replies, ‘I found in him _my_ Star, _my_ Sun.’”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Horatius Bonar see Hymn 129.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ VOX DELECTI was composed by J. B. Dykes for this hymn in _Hymns\r\nAncient and Modern_, Appendix, 1868. The musical difficulties of the\r\ntune are more apparent than real. They can be overcome and its\r\npossibilities appreciated by careful study and practice. The first half\r\nis written in the minor key to carry the quiet, invitational words of\r\nJesus. The second part, the glad acceptance of the invitation, is\r\nwritten in the strongly contrasting major key.\r\n\r\nFor comments on J. B. Dykes see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n143. Art thou weary, heavy laden           _Stephen the Sabaite_, 725-94\r\n                                            _Tr. John M. Neale_, 1818-66\r\n\r\nA restful, appealing lyric on the theme, “Come unto me, all ye that\r\nlabor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” Matt. 11:28.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the few dialog hymns. [Others are “Watchman, tell us of the\r\nnight” (66), and “Who is He in yonder stall?” (96)]. It may be sung\r\nantiphonally, the choir singing the questions and the congregation the\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\nNeale published this hymn in his _Hymns of the Eastern Church_, 1862, as\r\na translation of a Greek hymn by Stephen the Sabaite. It is a\r\nparaphrase, however, rather than a translation.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Neale see Hymn 67.\r\n\r\nHymnody in the Eastern Church reached its height in the 8th century.\r\nStephen was a nephew of John of Damascus. At the age of 10 he was placed\r\nby his uncle in the monastery of Saint Sabas, located on a lofty cliff\r\noverhanging the ravine of the Kidron, between Jerusalem and the Dead\r\nSea. Here he lived for more than half a century, known as Stephen the\r\nSabaite. The monastery, many of the cells cut out of solid rock, still\r\nstands. The monks have been subjected to persecution, at various times,\r\nat the hands of Persians, Moslems, and Bedouin Arabs, and the monastery\r\nlooks much like a fortress.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ STEPHANOS was composed for this hymn by Henry W. Baker, and was\r\nfirst published in the appendix of the original edition of _Hymns\r\nAncient and Modern_, 1868. The tune was harmonized by W. H. Monk (See\r\n40).\r\n\r\nHenry Williams Baker, 1821-77, was educated at Cambridge, ordained in\r\n1844, and served as vicar of Monkland, Herefordshire, from 1851 till his\r\ndeath in 1877. He was editor-in-chief of the epoch-making book, _Hymns\r\nAncient and Modern_, to which he contributed several of his own hymns\r\nand tunes. As a High Churchman, he held to the doctrine of the celibacy\r\nof the clergy and was never married.\r\n\r\n\r\n144. O Jesus, Thou art standing                _William W. How_, 1823-97\r\n\r\nBased on Rev. 3:20: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man\r\nhear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with\r\nhim, and he with me.” It was composed after the author had been reading\r\nthe beautiful poem by Jean Ingelow, entitled “Brothers and a Sermon,”\r\ndescribing two brothers listening to an old parson in a fishing-village\r\nchurch. A part of the poem is as follows:\r\n\r\n  The parson knew that he had lost the eyes\r\n  And ears of those before him for he made\r\n  A pause ...\r\n  ... then with a sigh\r\n  Fronted the folk, lifted his grand gray head,\r\n  And said, as one that pondered now the words\r\n  He had been preaching on with new surprise,\r\n  And found fresh marvel in their sound, “Behold!\r\n  Behold!” saith He, “I stand at the door and knock.”\r\n\r\n  Open the door with shame, if ye have sinned;\r\n  If ye be sorry, open it with sighs.\r\n  Albeit the place be bare for poverty,\r\n  And comfortless for lack of plenishing,\r\n  Be not abashed for that, but open it,\r\n  And take Him in that comes to sup with thee;\r\n  “Behold!” He saith, “I stand at the door and knock!”\r\n\r\n            Speak, then, O rich and strong:\r\n  Open, O happy young, ere yet the hand\r\n  Of Him that knocks, wearied at last, forbear;\r\n  The patient foot its thankless quest refrain.\r\n  The wounded heart forevermore withdraw.\r\n\r\nHolman Hunt’s picture, “The Light of the World,” is an exquisite\r\nillustration of the spirit of this hymn.\r\n\r\nWilliam Walsham How was born at Shrewsbury, England, educated at Oxford,\r\nand ordained to the ministry in 1846. He served various churches as\r\npastor and declined offers of positions of more distinction. He refused\r\nthe bishopric of Durham, one of the most distinguished posts in the\r\nAnglican Church, with an income more than double what he then had. He\r\nwas a man of broad sympathies and apostolical zeal, and was a master of\r\nthe pastoral art. He collaborated with Thos. Baker Morrell in editing\r\n_Psalms and Hymns_, 1854, and in 1871 was joint editor of _Church\r\nHymns_, published by the Society for the Promotion of Christian\r\nKnowledge, the latter becoming the greatest rival of _Hymns Ancient and\r\nModern_ which that book had had to date. His poems are marked by\r\nsimplicity and beauty of diction and constitute some of the richest\r\ntreasures of modern hymnody.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. HILDA, also known as “St. Edith,” is an arrangement by Rev.\r\nEdward Husband of a tune published by Justin H. Knecht in _Vollständige\r\nSammlung_, Stuttgart, 1799.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Knecht see Hymn 511.\r\n\r\nEdward Husband, 1843-1908, was an English clergyman with a great deal of\r\nmusical talent and interest and was a well-known lecturer on the subject\r\nof church music.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PENITENCE AND CONFESSION\r\n\r\n\r\n145. Savior, when in dust to Thee              _Robert Grant_, 1779-1838\r\n\r\nA hymn of penitence which has had a wide use. It was published in the\r\n_Christian Observer_, 1815, as a Lenten “Litany.” The last line of each\r\nstanza (five in the original) read, “Hear our solemn litany,” here\r\nchanged to “Hear thy people when they cry.” Stanzas 2 and 4 have been\r\nmuch altered by an unknown hand. Grant’s original hymn of five stanzas\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n                                   1.\r\n  Savior, when in dust to Thee\r\n  Low we bow the adoring knee,\r\n  When, repentant, to the skies\r\n  Scarce we lift our weeping eyes,\r\n  Oh, by all Thy pains and woe\r\n  Suffered once for man below,\r\n  Bending from Thy throne on high,\r\n  Hear our solemn litany!\r\n\r\n                                   2.\r\n  By Thy helpless infant years,\r\n  By Thy life of want and tears,\r\n  By Thy days of sore distress\r\n  In the savage wilderness,\r\n  By the dread, mysterious hour\r\n  Of the insulting Tempter’s power,\r\n  Turn, O turn, a favoring eye,\r\n  Hear our solemn litany!\r\n\r\n                                   3.\r\n  By the sacred griefs that wept\r\n  O’er the grave where Lazarus slept;\r\n  By the boding tears that flowed\r\n  Over Salem’s loved abode;\r\n  By the anguished sigh that told\r\n  Treachery lurked within Thy fold;\r\n  From Thy seat above the sky\r\n  Hear our solemn litany!\r\n\r\n                                   4.\r\n  By Thine hour of dire despair,\r\n  By Thine agony of prayer,\r\n  By the cross, the nail, the thorn,\r\n  Piercing spear, and torturing scorn,\r\n  By the gloom that veiled the skies\r\n  O’er the dreadful sacrifice,\r\n  Listen to our humble cry,\r\n  Hear our solemn litany!\r\n\r\n                                   5.\r\n  By Thy deep expiring groan,\r\n  By the sad sepulchral stone,\r\n  By the vault whose dark abode\r\n  Held in vain the rising God,\r\n  Oh, from earth to heaven restored,\r\n  Mighty, reascended Lord,\r\n  Listen, listen, to the cry\r\n  Of our solemn litany!\r\n\r\nFor comments on Robert Grant see Hymn 7.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SPANISH HYMN, also called “Spanish Chant,” is from an old 17th\r\ncentury melody of unknown origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n146. Come, let us to the Lord our God            _John Morison_, 1750-98\r\n                                             _Scottish Paraphrase_, 1781\r\n\r\nA version, from the Scottish Presbyterian Church, of Hosea 6:1-4:\r\n\r\n  Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will\r\n  heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. After two days will\r\n  he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live\r\n  in his sight. Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord:\r\n  his going forth is prepared as the morning: and he shall come unto us\r\n  as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.\r\n\r\n  O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto\r\n  thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it\r\n  goeth away.\r\n\r\nOur hymn is one of the 67 “Translations and Paraphrases, in Verse, of\r\nSeveral Passages of Sacred Scriptures,” together with five hymns, that\r\nare appended to the _Scottish Psalter_ for use in public worship in the\r\nScotch Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\nJohn Morison was a Scotch scholar, teacher, and minister. He wrote a\r\nnumber of paraphrases of scriptural passages, seven of which were\r\naccepted into the authorized collection of _Scottish Paraphrases_, 1781.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BALLERMA. For comments on this tune see Hymn 57.\r\n\r\n\r\n147. Lord, thy mercy now entreating     _Mary Ann Sidebotham_, 1833-1913\r\n\r\nA hymn of penitence which was contributed to _The Children’s Hymn Book_,\r\n1881, published by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge,\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe author, Mary Ann Sidebotham, was an accomplished musician and a\r\nlifelong friend of Henry Smart, the eminent organist and composer. She\r\nspent much of her life in her brother’s vicarage, St.\r\nThomas-on-the-Bourne, Surrey, England, where she served as organist. She\r\ncomposed numerous songs for children and was the music editor of the\r\nabove-mentioned _Children’s Hymn Book_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ RINGE RECHT. For comments on this tune see Hymn 563.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FAITH AND VISION\r\n\r\n\r\n148. Rock of Ages, cleft for me           _Augustus M. Toplady_, 1740-78\r\n\r\nFew hymns are more generally familiar or more treasured in the\r\naffections of all ranks of people than this. It appeared first in the\r\n_Gospel Magazine_, edited by Toplady, March, 1776, at the end of an\r\narticle entitled, “A remarkable calculation Introduced here for the sake\r\nof the Spiritual Improvements subjoined. Questions and answers relating\r\nto the National Debt.” The article points out that the national debt is\r\nso large that the government will never be able to pay it off. The\r\nauthor then proceeds to calculate the number of sins each human being\r\ncommits. Figuring the rate to be one per second, he arrives at this:\r\n\r\n  Our dreadful account stands as follows: At ten years old each of us is\r\n  chargeable with 315 millions and 360,000 sins. At twenty, with 630\r\n  millions and 720,000. At thirty with 946 millions and 80,000.... At\r\n  eighty, with 2,522 millions and 880,000.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that the debt can only be paid by the blood of Christ.\r\nThe hymn follows his “calculation,” under the heading, “A living and\r\ndying Prayer for the Holiest Believer in the World.”\r\n\r\nFor 45 years after its publication, the hymn had little acceptance in\r\nEngland. Its merits then became recognized, and it became very popular.\r\nIn the last century and a quarter it has had world-wide use, in a form\r\naltered somewhat from the original. The hymn has been criticized for its\r\nmixed metaphors (“cleft rock,” “riven side,” “to thy cross I cling,” “to\r\nthe fountain fly”), for its false rhymes, and its over-emphasis upon sin\r\nobsession; but it has certain heart-piercing qualities which override\r\nall its faults. Like other hymns of the first rank (e.g., “Jesus Lover\r\nof my soul,” “Lead kindly light,” and “Nearer my God to Thee”) it voices\r\nthe universal need of divine help. Professor Saintsbury, a literary\r\ncritic, says of this hymn: “Every word, every syllable, in this really\r\ngreat poem has its place and meaning.”\r\n\r\nThe central imagery of the hymn is found in the following Scripture\r\npassages: Ex. 33:22: “While my glory passeth by, I will put thee in a\r\ncleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by”;\r\nIsa. 26:4: “Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is\r\nthe rock of ages” (margin); I Cor. 10:4: “and that Rock was Christ.”\r\n\r\nA picturesque story, which originated about 1850, had it that Toplady\r\ncomposed the hymn while he was sheltering from a thunder storm in a\r\ngreat cleft of a limestone rock, some twelve years before the\r\npublication of the hymn. The story is without foundation. Toplady was\r\nfascinated by the thought of Christ as a rock and in a sermon on Isa.\r\n42:11: “Let the inhabitants of the rock sing,” he said: “Chiefly may\r\nthey sing who inhabit Christ the spiritual Rock of Ages. He is a Rock in\r\nthree ways: as a Foundation to support, a Shelter to screen, and a\r\nFortress to protect.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn has had a wide use among German speaking people in a\r\ntranslation made by Ernst Gebhardt, 1832-99.\r\n\r\n  Fels des Heils, geöffnet mir,\r\n  Birg’ mich, ew’ger Hort in dir!\r\n  Lass das Wasser und das Blut,\r\n  Deiner Seite heil’ge Flut,\r\n  Mir das Heil sein, das frei macht\r\n  Von der Sünden Schuld und Macht!\r\n\r\n  Dem, was dein Gesetze spricht,\r\n  Kann mein Werk genügen nicht.\r\n  Mag ich ringen wie ich will,\r\n  Fliessen auch der Tränen viel,\r\n  Tilgt das doch nicht meine Schuld,\r\n  Herr, mir hilft nur deine Huld.\r\n\r\n  Da ich denn nichts bringen kann,\r\n  Schmieg’ ich an dein Kreuz mich an\r\n  Nackt und bloss—o kleid’ mich doch.\r\n  Hülflos—ach erbarm’ dich noch.\r\n  Unrein, Herr, flieh’ ich zu dir.\r\n  Wasche mich, sonst sterb’ ich hier.\r\n\r\n  Jetzt, da ich noch leb’ im Licht,\r\n  Wenn mein Aug’ im Tode bricht,\r\n  Wenn durch’s finst’re Tal ich geh’,\r\n  Wenn ich vor dem Richter steh’,\r\n  Fels des Heils, geöffnet mir,\r\n  Birg’ mich, ew’ger Hort in dir!\r\n\r\nAugustus M. Toplady, born at Farnham, England, was educated at Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin. His conversion occurred at the age of 16 while on a\r\nvisit in Ireland. The service was held in a barn and the text was Eph.\r\n2:13: “But now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off are made\r\nnigh by the blood of Christ.” The preacher was an illiterate but\r\nwarm-hearted layman named Morris. Concerning his conversion Toplady\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n  Strange that I, who had so long sat under the means of grace in\r\n  England, should be brought nigh unto God in an obscure part of\r\n  Ireland, amidst a handful of God’s people met together in a barn, and\r\n  under the ministry of one who could hardly spell his name. Surely this\r\n  is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous.\r\n\r\nToplady was ordained to the ministry of the Church of England in 1762\r\nand in 1768 became vicar of Broadhembury. The last years of his life\r\nwere passed in London preaching in a chapel of French Calvinists. He was\r\na powerful preacher, and large congregations came to hear him. A strong\r\nCalvinist, and bitterly opposed to what he considered the reproach of\r\nArminianism, he became involved in unfortunate controversies with John\r\nWesley, during which neither disputant showed himself at his best. He\r\ndied of consumption at the early age of 38.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ TOPLADY was composed for this hymn by Thomas Hastings,\r\n1784-1872. It is a popular easily sung tune, and universally used in\r\nAmerica with this hymn. Hastings was not a great musician and this tune,\r\nwith its “sentimentality and rocking-chair rhythm,” can hardly be\r\nconsidered great music. But it has been a blessing to millions of people\r\nand will doubtless continue to be sung for years to come. In England the\r\nhymn is invariably set to other tunes and some American hymn books have\r\nintroduced alternative tunes. The tune “Petra” (109) is used with this\r\nhymn, as is also _Grosser Gott wir loben Dich_ (519).\r\n\r\nFor comments on Thomas Hastings see Hymn 120.\r\n\r\n\r\n149. Strong Son of God, immortal love         _Alfred Tennyson_, 1809-92\r\n\r\nFrom the prologue of Tennyson’s great poem, “In Memoriam,” 1850,\r\ncontaining eleven stanzas; these are 1, 4, 5, and 7, unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe story of “In Memoriam” is familiar. At Cambridge University,\r\nTennyson and Arthur Hallam became intimate friends. Hallam became\r\nengaged to Tennyson’s sister, and, after graduating from the University,\r\ntook a trip to the Continent. At Vienna, he became sick and died, which\r\nprompted Tennyson to write the following brief but beautiful words:\r\n\r\n  “In Vienna’s fatal walls,\r\n  God’s finger touched him, and he slept.”\r\n\r\nIn 1850, seventeen years after Hallam’s death, Tennyson published “In\r\nMemoriam,” a memorial to Hallam, but also to himself as well. Among the\r\nindividual verses of the poem which have become immortal are the\r\nfamiliar lines beginning, “Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky.” (See\r\n379).\r\n\r\nAlfred Tennyson was the son of Rev. George C. Tennyson. He was educated\r\nat Cambridge and wrote poetry while an undergraduate. Upon the death of\r\nWordsworth in 1850, Tennyson was appointed Poet Laureate. He is regarded\r\nas one of England’s greatest poets. He was not a hymn writer, yet\r\nseveral of his poems are used as hymns. Tennyson died October 6, 1892,\r\nand was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. CRISPIN was composed for the hymn “Just as I am, without\r\none plea.” The tune was used at the funeral of the composer.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, George Elvey, see Hymn 118.\r\n\r\n\r\n150. My faith looks up to Thee                     _Ray Palmer_, 1808-87\r\n\r\nThis hymn was written when the author had just left Yale at the age of\r\n21 and was looking forward to his lifework in the Congregational\r\nministry. The origin of the hymn is given in Duffield’s _English Hymns_,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  The hymn was written in 1830, but not published (as a hymn) until\r\n  1882. The author was in New York City, “Between his college and\r\n  theological studies,” and was in poor health, and a teacher in a\r\n  ladies’ school. Dr. Palmer says: “I gave form to what I felt by\r\n  writing, with little effort, the stanzas. I recollect I wrote them\r\n  with very tender emotion, and ended the last lines with tears.” The\r\n  manuscript was then placed in a pocket-book, where it remained for\r\n  some time. Its true discoverer was Lowell Mason, the musician, who\r\n  asked young Palmer if he had not some hymn or hymns to contribute to\r\n  his new book. The pocket-book was produced and the little hymn, then\r\n  between two and three years old, and never previously utilized, though\r\n  it had been in print as a poem, was brought to light. Dr. Mason was\r\n  attracted by it, and desired a copy. They stepped together into a\r\n  store (it was in Boston), and the copy was made and taken away without\r\n  further comment. On carefully reading the hymn at home, Dr. Mason was\r\n  so interested that he wrote for it the tune “Olivet,” to which it is\r\n  usually sung. Two or three days later, he again met the author in the\r\n  street, and scarcely waiting to salute him, he said, “Mr. Palmer, you\r\n  may live many years, and do many good things, but I think you will be\r\n  best known to posterity as the author of ‘My Faith looks up to Thee.’”\r\n\r\nThe hymn appeared first in _Spiritual Songs for Social Worship_, 1831,\r\nby Thomas Hastings and Lowell Mason. It has been translated into many\r\nlanguages on the mission fields.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ OLIVET. For comments on the composer, Lowell Mason, see Hymn\r\n12.\r\n\r\n\r\n151. How firm a foundation             _“K” in Rippon’s Selection_, 1787\r\n\r\nA great song of faith, calling to mind such scripture passages as Heb.\r\n13:5: “I will never leave thee nor forsake thee”; Isa. 43:1, 2: “Fear\r\nnot, for I have redeemed thee: I have called thee by thy name; thou art\r\nmine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and\r\nthrough the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest\r\nthrough the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame\r\nkindle upon thee.”\r\n\r\nThe authorship is uncertain. The hymn appeared in _A Selection of Hymns\r\nfrom the Best Authors_, 1787, edited by John Rippon, 1751-1836, pastor\r\nof the Baptist Church in Carter’s Lane, London, where it was signed “K.”\r\nWho “K” was remains uncertain. The best guess seems to be that it refers\r\nto Robert Keene, precentor in Dr. Rippon’s church. It is one more\r\nexample of a writer sending forth an immortal song to bless and\r\nstrengthen the faith of millions, and then hiding himself completely\r\nfrom public notice.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ADESTE FIDELIS. For comments on this tune see Hymn 80.\r\n\r\n\r\n152. We walk by faith, and not by sight          _Henry Alford_, 1810-71\r\n\r\nBased on the story of the incredulity of Thomas in John 20:25-29:\r\n“Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my\r\nfinger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I\r\nwill not believe ... blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have\r\nbelieved.”\r\n\r\nHenry Alford was educated at Cambridge for the Anglican ministry. After\r\nserving various churches, he finally, in 1857, became Dean of\r\nCanterbury, the highest post in the church. He was a renowned scholar\r\nand the author of numerous volumes. His _Greek Testament_ was his\r\ngreatest work and remained the standard critical commentary of the\r\nlatter 19th century. He was a member of the New Testament Revision\r\nCompany, whose work resulted in the revised version in 1881. Greatly\r\ninterested in hymnology, he himself wrote and translated many hymns, and\r\npublished several collections of hymns. Dean Alford was a strenuous\r\nworker, never idle, always broad-minded and throughout his life\r\nmaintained cordial relations with non-conformists. A lifelong desire to\r\nvisit the Holy Land remained unfilled; which fact suggested the\r\nbeautiful inscription on his tombstone: “_Deversorium viatoris\r\nproficiscentis Hierosolymam_”—“the inn of a pilgrim travelling to\r\nJerusalem.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ARLINGTON is a tune from Thos. A. Arne’s opera _Artaxerxes_,\r\narranged by Rev. Ralph Harrison, 1748-1810, an English Presbyterian\r\nminister who published it in his _Sacred Harmony_, 1784.\r\n\r\nThos. A. Arne, 1710-1778, was educated for the legal profession. He\r\nturned away from law to become the foremost English composer of the 18th\r\ncentury. He received his degree of Doctor of Music from Oxford in 1759.\r\nArne wrote the patriotic air, “Rule Britannia,” besides many other\r\npopular songs. His sister, a famous contralto, was chosen by Handel as\r\none of the soloists for the first performance of _The Messiah_ in\r\nDublin, April 13, 1742.\r\n\r\n\r\n153. O for a faith that will not shrink            _Wm. Hiley Bathurst_,\r\n                                                               1796-1877\r\n\r\nAn excellent hymn on “The Power of Faith,” based on I John 5:4: “And\r\nthis is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” It\r\nappeared in the author’s _Psalms and Hymns for Public and Private Use_,\r\n1831.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hiley Bathurst graduated from Oxford in 1818. During 33 years of\r\nministry at Barwick-in-Elmet, he endeared himself to his people by his\r\n“eminent piety, his great simplicity of character, his tender love, and\r\nhis abundant generosity.” He was a shy and reserved man “and had the\r\npeculiarity of becoming utterly silent if one asked the most trivial\r\nquestion.” His father was Charles Bragge, a member of Parliament for\r\nBristol. The son assumed the name of Bathurst on succeeding to the\r\nestate of his uncle, Earl Bathurst, at Lydney Park, Gloucester.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EVAN was originally a setting by Wm. H. Havergal for a poem by\r\nBurns, “O Thou dread power who reign’st above.” Lowell Mason took a part\r\nof the melody and arranged it, as here, for a psalm tune, publishing it\r\nin _New Carmina Sacra_, 1850, under the name “Eva.” It might be added\r\nthat Havergal disapproved of the arrangement as a “sad estrangement.” In\r\nspite of this, Mason’s arrangement has remained popular.\r\n\r\nRev. W. H. Havergal, 1793-1870, graduated from Oxford and was ordained\r\nin the Church of England. He became the rector of a church, but due to a\r\ncarriage accident which resulted in concussion of the brain and injury\r\nto his eyesight, he resigned his church and devoted himself to the study\r\nof church music. In this field, he made a significant contribution by\r\nhis compositions and his efforts at purifying and elevating the music\r\nused in the church. His daughter, Frances Ridley Havergal (see 126),\r\nwrote many hymns, six of which are found in the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n154. Faith of our fathers, living still    _Frederick W. Faber_, 1814-63\r\n\r\nA stirring hymn of faith bringing to mind the story of the Christian\r\nmartyrs and pledging loyalty till death to the faith of our fathers. The\r\nlast stanza, suggesting the preaching of the faith through “kindly words\r\nand virtuous life,” is especially fine and Christian in spirit.\r\n\r\nBy “faith of our fathers” we mean, as we sing the hymn, the truth\r\ncontained in the Gospels, taught by the Apostles, and brought again into\r\nclear light at the Reformation. But the hymn originally, written by a\r\nRoman Catholic, had reference to the Roman Catholic faith. The author,\r\nan Englishman, wrote one verse as follows:\r\n\r\n  Faith of our fathers! Mary’s prayers\r\n    Shall win our country back to Thee!\r\n  And through the truth that comes from God\r\n    England indeed shall then be free.\r\n\r\nThe lines have been adapted for Protestant services to read:\r\n\r\n  Faith of our fathers! God’s great power\r\n    Shall soon all nations win for thee;\r\n  And through the truth that comes from God\r\n    Mankind shall then be truly free.\r\n\r\nThe stanza, somewhat over-optimistic, is omitted from the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, F. W. Faber, see Hymn 44.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. CATHERINE is of English origin. The composer, Henry F.\r\nHemy, 1818-88, was organist at St. Andrew’s Roman Catholic Church in\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, and a teacher of piano and singing. He wrote this\r\ntune for another hymn and published it in his _Crown of Jesus Music_,\r\n1864, a popular book in Catholic churches in England. The refrain was\r\nadded in an arrangement by James G. Walton, 1821-1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PEACE AND JOY\r\n\r\n\r\n155. Jesus, the very thought of Thee             _Ascribed to Bernard of\r\n                                                   Clairvaux_, 1091-1153\r\n                                           _Tr. Edward Caswall_, 1814-78\r\n\r\n“This may well be called the sweetest and most evangelical hymn of the\r\nMiddle Ages.... It breathes the deepest love to Christ, as the fountain\r\nof all peace and comfort, and the sum of all that is pure and\r\nlovely.”—Philip Schaff.\r\n\r\nIt is from the famous medieval hymn “_Jesu, dulcis memoria_,” which\r\nDavid Livingstone used to repeat as he explored Africa: “That hymn of\r\nSt. Bernard, on the name of Christ, although in what might be termed\r\ndog-Latin, pleases me so: it rings in my ears as I wander across the\r\nwide, wide wilderness.” Its beauty has charmed many others who are\r\nfamiliar with the Latin. The original poem has fifty quatrains, of which\r\nour hymn is a selection of the following five:\r\n\r\n  Iesus dulcis memoria,\r\n  Dans vera cordis gaudia;\r\n  Sed super mel et omnia\r\n  Dulcis eius praesentia.\r\n\r\n  Nil canitur suavius,\r\n  Auditur nil iucundius,\r\n  Nil cogitatur dulcius,\r\n  Quam Iesus, Dei Filius.\r\n\r\n  Iesu, spes paenitentibus,\r\n  Quem pius es pententibus,\r\n  Quam bonus te quaerentibus!\r\n  Sed quid invenientibus.\r\n\r\n  Nec lingua potest dicere,\r\n  Nec littera exprimere;\r\n  Experto potes credere,\r\n  Quid sit Iesum diligere.\r\n\r\n  Tu esto nostrum gaudium,\r\n  Qui es futurus praemium;\r\n  Sit nostra in te gloria\r\n  Per cuncta semper saecula.\r\n\r\nIt is usually attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux (See 539), but many\r\nauthorities now question the authorship. Percy Dearmer says in _Songs of\r\nPraise Discussed_ that “it is not by St. Bernard.... St. Bernard of\r\nClairvaux was born 1091 and the poem itself has been found in a\r\nmanuscript of the 11th century.” In further commenting on the authorship\r\nhe says, “We really know nothing and are not likely to know.”\r\n\r\nThe translation here is by Edward Caswall.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Caswall see Hymn 19.\r\n\r\nA translation of a different _cento_ of the same hymn, by Ray Palmer, is\r\nfound at No. 171.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. AGNES was written for this hymn in _A Hymnal for Use in the\r\nEnglish Church_, 1866, edited by Rev. J. Grey. In England it is called\r\n“St. Agnes, Durham,” to distinguish it from the tune, “Langran” (303)\r\nwhich is known in England as “St. Agnes.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, John B. Dykes, see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n156. Rejoice, ye pure in heart             _Edward H. Plumptre_, 1821-91\r\n\r\nA popular processional hymn written for that purpose in May, 1865, for a\r\nchoir festival in Peterborough Cathedral, one of the most important\r\nNorman churches now standing in England. It was published in the same\r\nyear in the author’s _Lazarus, and Other Poems_. The refrain has been\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Edward H. Plumptre see Hymn 95.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MARION was written in 1883 for this hymn. The tune is admirably\r\nadapted to the words and the combination has made this one of the\r\nchoicest of processional hymns. It is also effective for antiphonal\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\nArthur Henry Messiter, 1834-1916, born in Somersetshire, England, began\r\nthe serious study of music at the age of 17. Coming to America in 1863,\r\nhe sang for a time in the volunteer choir of Trinity Church, New York\r\nCity. Three years later this famous church appointed him their director\r\nof music and organist, a position he held with distinction for 31 years.\r\nHe is the author of several notable books on music and editor of\r\n_Episcopal Hymnal_ of 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n157. Jesus, our Savior, grant us Thy peace                 _E. C. Poppe_\r\n                                                 _Tr. Amanda Hostettler_\r\n                                                 _and E. Shippen Barnes_\r\n\r\nA hymn of the peace of God, based on Col. 3:15: “And let the peace of\r\nGod rule in your hearts, to which also ye are called”; and John 14:27:\r\n“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.”\r\n\r\nThe original poem of five stanzas appears in the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_\r\nwhere it is attributed to E. C. Poppe. Erhard Christoph Poppe, 1804-78,\r\nthe son of a goldsmith, was born in Bremen. He was a colporteur for the\r\nMethodist church.\r\n\r\n  Seliger Friede, köstliche Gab’\r\n    Meines geliebten Heilands, mich lab’;\r\n  Tief in mein Inn’res du dich ergiess’,\r\n    Dass ich dich, wie ich wünsche geniess.\r\n  O, wie schmeckst du dem Herzen so süss!\r\n\r\n  Seit mir mein Jesus Frieden geschenkt,\r\n    Hat sich mein Alles in Ihn versenkt;\r\n  Ach, wie war’s Ihm am Kreuze so bang!\r\n    O, wie Ihn dort die Liebe so drang!\r\n  Frieden zu spenden, Er für mich rang.\r\n\r\n  Jesu, verklär Dich in mir noch mehr,\r\n    Dass solchen Frieden ferner nichts stör’;\r\n  Wie ja ein Vater Gutes gern giebt,\r\n    Schenkst Du auch Deinem Kind, das Dich liebt;\r\n  Frieden, den keine Wolke mehr trübt.\r\n\r\n  Nimm Du allein das Herze uns ein,\r\n    Dass wir recht mild und sanftmüthig sein,\r\n  Dass uns’re Seelen, Dir nur geweiht,\r\n    Ruhen in Deinem Blut allezeit;\r\n  Friede versüsst uns dann Kreuz und Leid.\r\n\r\n  Gieb Deinen Frieden immer mir so,\r\n    Dass ich in Leid bleib’ ruhig und froh,\r\n  Und wenn auch höher steiget die Noth,\r\n    Ja, wenn zuletzt mir nahet der Tod,\r\n  Lass mich im Frieden eilen zu Gott.\r\n\r\nThis free translation, specially made for the _Hymnary_, is by Mrs.\r\nAmanda Hostettler, Upland, California, whose father, John Hirschler, was\r\na prominent minister in the General Conference of Mennonites. A few\r\nchanges in her work were made by E. Shippen Barnes.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Barnes see Hymn 48.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SELIGER FRIEDE, named after the initial words of the German\r\ntext, appeared anonymously in the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_. Its quiet,\r\npensive phrases are well adapted to the sentiment of the words.\r\n\r\n\r\n158-9. Jesus, Lover of my soul                 _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nThe greatest hymn of all time.\r\n\r\nMany of the stories concerning the origin of this hymn, such as that of\r\nthe bird flying in time of storm to Wesley, or a dove pursued by a hawk\r\nfinding refuge in his room, or Wesley’s own escape from a threatening\r\nmob, cannot be substantiated and must be dismissed as legendary, however\r\nplausible and fitting they may be.\r\n\r\nThe hymn first appeared in _Hymns and Sacred Poems_, 1740, with the\r\ntitle, “In time of Prayer and Temptation.” The third stanza, omitted\r\nfrom all hymnals, reads:\r\n\r\n  Wilt Thou not regard my call?\r\n    Wilt Thou not accept my prayer?\r\n  Lo, I sink, I faint, I fall,\r\n    Lo, on Thee I cast my care.\r\n  Reach me out Thy gracious hand,\r\n    While I of Thy strength receive,\r\n  Hoping against hope I stand,\r\n    Dying, and behold, I live.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity and literacy art of the hymn are unsurpassed. Of the 188\r\nwords in the four stanzas of the hymn generally used, all but 31 are\r\nmonosyllables. The hymn has been translated into virtually every\r\nlanguage and uncounted millions have found it a source of help in time\r\nof need. Henry Ward Beecher once said: “I would rather have written that\r\nhymn than to have the fame of all the kings that ever sat upon the\r\nearth.”\r\n\r\nIn the annotated edition of the _Book of Common Praise_, 1909, the\r\nfollowing story is given:\r\n\r\n  A party of Northern tourists were on the deck of an excursion steamer,\r\n  on the Potomac, one summer evening in 1881. One of the party, who had\r\n  a remarkable voice, began to sing hymns to the others. When he had\r\n  sung two verses of “Jesu, lover of my soul,” a stranger made his way\r\n  from the outskirts of the crowd: “Beg your pardon, sir, but were you\r\n  actively engaged in the late war?” “Yes, sir, I fought under General\r\n  Grant.” “Well,” the first speaker continued, “I did my fighting on the\r\n  other side, and I think I was very near you one bright night eighteen\r\n  years ago this month. It was much such a night as this. If I am not\r\n  mistaken, you were on guard-duty. We of the South had sharp business\r\n  on hand. I crept near your post of duty, my weapon in my hand; the\r\n  shadows hid me. Your beat led you into the clear light. As you paced\r\n  back and forth you were singing that same hymn. I raised my gun and\r\n  aimed at your heart—and I had been selected for the work because I was\r\n  a sure shot. Then out upon the night floated the words:\r\n\r\n  Cover my defenceless head\r\n  With the shadow of thy wing.\r\n\r\n  Your prayer was answered. I couldn’t fire after that. And there was no\r\n  attack made upon your camp that night. I felt sure, when I heard you\r\n  singing this evening, that you were the man whose life I was spared\r\n  from taking.” The singer grasped the hand of the Southerner and said:\r\n  “I remember the night very well, and the feeling of depression with\r\n  which I went forth to my duty. I knew the post was one of great\r\n  danger. I paced my lonely beat, thinking of home and friends and all\r\n  that life holds dear. Then the thought of God’s care came to me with\r\n  peculiar force, and I sang the prayer of my heart and ceased to feel\r\n  alone. How the prayer was answered I never knew until this evening.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MARTYN. The composer of this tune, Simeon B. Marsh, 1798-1875,\r\nspent many years teaching singing classes in and near Albany, N. Y.,\r\ntravelling constantly on horseback from town to town through Albany\r\nPresbytery. It was while enroute on his weekly circuit, one day during\r\nthe autumn of 1834, that the melody took form. He alighted from his\r\nhorse and wrote the music which he set to a hymn by John Newton, “Mary\r\nto her Saviour’s tomb.” Thomas Hastings later set the tune to “Jesus,\r\nLover of my soul,” a combination now deeply imbedded in the affections\r\nof the American Church.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HOLLINGSIDE (159) is the tune composed by John B. Dykes,\r\n1823-76, especially for this hymn. The tune has more of musical interest\r\nthan the better known “Martyn,” and many hymnals give it first place for\r\nuse with this hymn. Dykes was always particular about the naming of his\r\ntunes, often some incident in his life supplying the name. “Hollingside”\r\nwas the name of the cottage he lived in, while precentor at Durham, when\r\nhe wrote this. Regarding its composition, one of his sisters wrote:\r\n\r\n  Some scenes during that visit will live forever in my memory. As, for\r\n  instance, one calm Sunday evening, when I sat in the verandah in the\r\n  deepening twilight and heard, through the open window, my brother\r\n  composing and playing over the tune “Hollingside,” to the words “Jesu,\r\n  Lover of my soul.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Dykes see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GUIDANCE AND PROTECTION\r\n\r\n\r\n160. Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah          _William Williams_, 1717-91\r\n\r\nA superb hymn of guidance in which the analogies of the history of\r\nIsrael in the wilderness appear in every stanza and almost in every\r\nline. It was written in Welsh in 1745 and translated into English in\r\n1771 by Rev. Peter Williams, friend of the author and fellow-worker.\r\nSome think stanzas 2 and 3 were translated by the author himself or by\r\nhis son, the Rev. John Williams.\r\n\r\nThe hymn in Welsh, with its unpronounceable words, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Arglwydd, arwain trwy’r anialwch\r\n    Fi bererin gwael ei wedd,\r\n  Nad oes ynof nerth na bywyd,\r\n    Fel yn gorwedd yn y bedd:\r\n      Hollalluog\r\n  Ydyw’r un a’m cwyd i’r lan.\r\n\r\n  Agor y ffynnonau melus\r\n    Sydd yn tarddu o’r Graig i maes;\r\n  ’Rhyd yr anial mawr canlyned\r\n    Afon iachawdwriaeth grâs:\r\n      Rho imi hyny;\r\n  Dim i mi ond dy fwynhau.\r\n\r\n  Ymddiriedaf yn dy allu,\r\n    Mawr yw’r gwaith a wnest erioed:\r\n  Ti gest angau, ti gest uffern,\r\n    Ti gest Satan dan dy droed:\r\n      Pen Calfaria,\r\n  Nac aed hwnw byth o’m cof.\r\n\r\nWilliam Williams was the chief hymn writer of Wales and one of her\r\ngreatest poets. He at first was in training for the medical profession\r\nbut after attending some revival services, decided to become a minister.\r\nOn account of his evangelical views (and his interest in evangelistic\r\nwork), he came in conflict with church dignitaries, resulting in his\r\nwithdrawal from the Established Church, and throwing himself into\r\nevangelistic work. His preaching itineraries took him throughout Wales.\r\nHe travelled an average of 3,000 miles per year for 50 years. He wrote\r\nmany hymns, stirring the nation, influencing its character, and\r\ndeepening its faith. Williams was to Wales what Paul Gerhardt was to\r\nGermany and Isaac Watts to England.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DISMISSAL was composed for the hymn “Lord, dismiss us with Thy\r\nblessing” (45).\r\n\r\nThe composer, William Letton Viner, 1790-1867, was a student of Charles\r\nWesley, Jr. He was organist at St. Michael’s Church, Bath, for 18 years\r\nand at St. Mary’s Penzance for 21 years. In 1859, he came to the United\r\nStates. He composed organ and church music and songs, and edited several\r\nhymnals.\r\n\r\n\r\n161. Jesus, Savior, pilot me                    _Edward Hopper_, 1818-88\r\n\r\nA beautiful hymn suggested by the seafaring life. It was published\r\nanonymously in _Sailors’ Magazine_, 1871, and again in the _Baptist\r\nPraise Book_, 1871, and in C. S. Robinson’s collection of _Spiritual\r\nSongs_, 1878. The author of the hymn, unknown for several years, was\r\ndiscovered at the anniversary of the Seamen’s Friend Society, held at\r\nthe Broadway Tabernacle, New York City, May 10, 1880. Dr. Edward Hopper,\r\npopular pastor of the Church of the Sea and Land in New York, having\r\nbeen asked to write a special hymn for the occasion, brought instead,\r\n“Jesus Savior, pilot me,” not aware that the hymn had already been\r\npublished in several church hymnals. The public learned then for the\r\nfirst time the real authorship of the hymn. The original has six\r\nstanzas, this being a selection of 1, 5, and 6.\r\n\r\nEdward Hopper was born in New York City. He graduated from New York\r\nUniversity and then prepared himself at Union Theological Seminary, New\r\nYork, for the Presbyterian ministry. For many years he was pastor of the\r\nChurch of the Sea and Land in New York, which sailors attended in large\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PILOT, universally sung and beautifully adapted to these words,\r\nwas written just before the composer sailed for Europe a short while\r\nbefore his death. He played the tune on the piano the night before he\r\nembarked on shipboard for his last earthly voyage.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on the composer, John E. Gould, see Hymn 141.\r\n\r\n\r\n162-3. Lead, kindly Light                   _John Henry Newman_, 1801-90\r\n\r\nA prayer for light and guidance, written on Sunday, June 16, 1833, while\r\nthe author, travelling for his health, was lying, sick in mind and body,\r\non the deck of a sail vessel that was becalmed for a whole week in the\r\nStraits of Bonifacio, in the Mediterranean Sea. Newman was going through\r\na period of great heart-searching because of the disturbed conditions in\r\nEngland, both in church and state. His depressed feelings were\r\naccentuated by the wretched state of his health. The hymn deserves its\r\nwide popularity, for it expresses the universal longing for divine help\r\nin time of deep depression. The meaning of “kindly light” was never\r\nexplained by the author. To some it represents the Inward Light of\r\nconscience; to others just the divine guidance; but to most people it\r\ndoubtless means Christ as the Light of the World.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Newman was born in London, the son of a banker. His parents\r\nwere devout nonconformists and brought up their son in the evangelical\r\nfaith. After a distinguished career at Trinity College, Oxford, Newman\r\nwas ordained in the Church of England, and became the vicar of the\r\nOxford University Church, a post he filled with distinction from 1828 to\r\n1843. His charm of personality and pulpit eloquence made him a profound\r\ninfluence at the University. Newman became a leader in the Oxford\r\nMovement and finally, in 1845, after a period of much hesitation, he\r\nleft Anglicanism to unite with the Roman Catholic Church. His _Apologia\r\npro Vita Sua_, a masterpiece of autobiography, constitutes a powerful\r\ndefense of the Roman system of belief. In 1879, after some years of\r\nneglect by the church, he was made a cardinal. His fine Christian\r\ncharacter, and spiritual force, as well as his literary ability, were\r\nuniversally recognized. Newman was a great Englishman and a great saint\r\nthough referred to by some writers as an “angel who lost his way.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LUX BENIGNA was written for these words by J. B. Dykes. Dykes\r\ntold a friend that the tune came to him while walking through the Strand\r\nin London. The tune is also known as “St. Oswald.”\r\n\r\nA friend visiting Cardinal Newman said to him of “Lead, Kindly Light”:\r\n“It must be a great pleasure to you to know that you have written a hymn\r\ntreasured wherever English speaking Christians are to be found: and\r\nwhere are they not found?” To which Newman, after thoughtful silence,\r\nreplied: “Yes, deeply thankful, and more than thankful: but you see it\r\nis not the hymn, but the tune, that has gained the popularity! The tune\r\nis Dykes’, and Dr. Dykes was a great master.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on J. B. Dykes see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\nSANDON was also written for this hymn. It appeared in _The Church and\r\nHome Metrical Psalter and Hymnal_, 1860, edited by Purday himself. It is\r\nsimpler in form than LUX BENIGNA and is an effective and desirable\r\nalternative tune.\r\n\r\nCharles Purday, 1799-1885, the composer, was at one time a noted singer\r\nin London. He became a publisher of music and was a popular lecturer on\r\nmusical subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n164. Lead us, O Father, in the paths of peace         _Wm. H. Burleigh_,\r\n                                                                 1812-71\r\n\r\nA hymn on the journey of life, entitled by the author, “Prayer for\r\nGuidance.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Burleigh was brought up on a farm at Plainfield, Conn. At\r\nthe age of 25, he went to Pittsburgh, Pa., and learned the printing\r\ntrade and journalism. He later became editor of the _Christian Freeman_,\r\nan abolitionist journal, at Hartford, Conn. He was an ardent temperance\r\nreformer and advocate of the abolition of slavery. His last appointment\r\nwas harbour master at New York, a post he held for 15 years. Burleigh\r\nbelonged to a distinguished group of Unitarians who have contributed to\r\nAmerican hymnody. His wife, Celia Burleigh, was for some time minister\r\nof the Unitarian Church at Brooklyn, Conn., and wrote the _Life_ of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LONGWOOD was composed for John Ellerton’s hymn, “Savior, again\r\nto thy dear name we raise” (43).\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Joseph Barnby, see Hymn 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n165. O’er the trackless ocean guided               _Wm. H. Adams_, 1864—\r\n\r\nA hymn on pioneer service, written probably with the Pilgrim Fathers in\r\nmind, but equally applicable to other groups of immigrants who came\r\n“o’er the trackless ocean” to build “rude homes” in the “new land, wild\r\nand lonely.”\r\n\r\nInformation concerning the author has not been traced. The hymn is not\r\nlisted in _Julian’s Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BEECHER. For comments on this tune and its composer see Hymn\r\n178.\r\n\r\n\r\n166. For them whose ways are in the height      _Richard Roberts_, 1874—\r\n\r\nThis hymn for travellers by air was created to meet the new day of\r\namazing development which has taken place in modern travel. It is a\r\nwelcome addition to the hymnody of travel.\r\n\r\nRichard Roberts, born in Wales, in 1874, is an eminent preacher. Before\r\ngoing to Canada where he became the first Moderator of the United Church\r\nof Canada, he occupied pulpits in Wales, London, and Brooklyn. He is one\r\nof the founders of the “Fellowship of Reconciliation.” His views on the\r\nrelation of the church to war are well expressed in his own words:\r\n\r\n  The world order in which war is inherent, the church exists to\r\n  transform. When it supports the method of war, an end-product of the\r\n  unredeemed world order, the church is not only proclaiming its own\r\n  failure, but is hauling down its own flag and hoisting instead the\r\n  flag of the world.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MORWELLHAM was composed by Charles Steggall, 1826-1905, an\r\nEnglish musician who was educated at the Royal Academy of Music in\r\nLondon and then for half a century was chief professor of the organ in\r\nthe same institution. He is said to have trained more organists than any\r\nteacher in England. Steggall was an enthusiast for the music of Bach and\r\nserved as honorary secretary of the Bach Society. He composed anthems\r\nand church music and had a lifelong interest in hymnology. He succeeded\r\nW. H. Monk as musical editor of _Hymns Ancient and Modern_.\r\n\r\n\r\n167. O God of Bethel, by whose hand          _Philip Doddridge_, 1702-51\r\n                                                            _and others_\r\n\r\nA paraphrase of Genesis 28:20-22: “And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God\r\nwill be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give\r\nme bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my\r\nfather’s house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: and this stone,\r\nwhich I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that\r\nthou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn has undergone certain changes and additions so that it really\r\nis a composite production, the details of which need not be enumerated\r\nhere. Ours is the Scottish version found in the _Scottish Paraphrases_,\r\n1781. In Scotland it is the best-loved of the paraphrases as “The Lord’s\r\nMy Shepherd” is the best-loved of the psalms.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Philip Doddridge see Hymn 56.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SALZBURG is an adaptation of an air in a movement of a Mass\r\ncomposed by J. M. Haydn “for the use of country choirs.” It was\r\noriginally in 6-8 time. An entirely different tune by the same name is\r\nfound at Hymn 545.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Johann Michael Haydn see Hymn 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n168. Captain of Israel’s host, and Guide       _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nBased on the story of God’s guidance of the Israelites during their\r\nexodus from Egypt and their journeyings in the wilderness, Exodus\r\n13:17-22.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MIDDLESEX is an anonymous tune, the origin of which has not\r\nbeen traced. The hymn and tune were taken from _The Hymnary_, published\r\nin Toronto, 1930, by the United Church of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n169. Eternal Father! strong to save           _William Whiting_, 1825-78\r\n\r\nA hymn for travellers by sea. This hymn and tune have long been used\r\nmore frequently than any other for that purpose. Sir Evelyn Wood wrote\r\nregarding this hymn: “It is much used by those at sea, and, when the\r\nwind blows hard, by those on land.” The words, written in 1860, have\r\nbeen revised several times.\r\n\r\nIt was the favorite hymn of the late Franklin D. Roosevelt and was sung\r\nat his funeral at Hyde Park, New York, April 14, 1945.\r\n\r\nWilliam Whiting was a native of Kensington, London, and was for over\r\ntwenty years master of the Choristers’ School at Winchester College.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MELITA was written for this hymn. For comments on the composer,\r\nJ. B. Dykes, see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LOVE AND GRATITUDE\r\n\r\n\r\n170. Jesus, Thy boundless love to me            _Paul Gerhardt_, 1607-76\r\n                                                       _Tr. John Wesley_\r\n\r\nA hymn of the love of Christ, suited especially well for the Communion\r\nService. This great hymn by Paul Gerhardt first appeared in Crüger’s\r\n_Praxis Pietatis Melica_, Berlin, 1653, in sixteen stanzas. John Wesley,\r\ngreat revivalist and eminent translator of German hymns, rendered the\r\nentire hymn into English, in a different meter, and published it in\r\n_Hymns and Sacred Poems_, 1739. Our hymn consists of the first three\r\nstanzas, the original of which are as follows:\r\n\r\n  O Jesu Christ, mein schönstes Licht,\r\n    Der du in deiner Seelen\r\n  So hoch mich liebst, dass ich es nicht\r\n    Aussprechen kann noch zählen:\r\n  Gib, dass mein Herz dich wiederum\r\n    Mit Lieben und Verlangen\r\n    Mög’ umfangen\r\n  Und als dein Eigentum\r\n    Nur einzig an dir hangen!\r\n\r\n  Gib, dass sonst nichts in meiner Seel’\r\n    Als deine Liebe wohne;\r\n  Gib, dass ich deine Lieb’ erwähl’\r\n    Als meinen Schatz und Krone!\r\n  Stoss alles aus, nimm alles hin,\r\n    Was dich und mich will trennen\r\n    Und nicht gönnen,\r\n  Dass all mein Mut und Sinn\r\n    In deiner Liebe brennen!\r\n\r\n  Wie freundlich, selig, süss und schön\r\n    Ist, Jesu, deine Liebe!\r\n  Wo diese steht, kann nichts bestehn,\r\n    Das meinen Geist betrübe;\r\n  Drum lass nichts andres denken mich,\r\n    Nichts sehen, fühlen, hören,\r\n    Lieben, ehren\r\n  Als deine Lieb’ und dich,\r\n    Der du sie kannst vermehren!\r\n\r\nThe prayer for the realization of the love of Christ was answered\r\nabundantly in Wesley’s own life. In his _Plain Account of Christian\r\nPerfection_, he wrote:\r\n\r\n  In the beginning of the year 1738, as I was returning from Savannah,\r\n  the cry of my heart was\r\n\r\n  “O grant that nothing in my soul\r\n  May dwell but Thy pure love alone.”\r\n\r\nOn May 24 of the same year, in the Society Meeting in Aldersgate Street,\r\nabout a quarter before nine, during the reading of Luther’s Preface to\r\nthe Epistle to the Romans, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I\r\ndid trust in Christ, Christ alone, for Salvation; and an assurance was\r\ngiven me that He had taken away my sins, even _mine_, and saved _me_\r\nfrom the law of sin and death.\r\n\r\nWesley became interested in the German chorales through his contact with\r\nthe Moravians. In 1735, he and his brother Charles Wesley set sail for\r\nGeorgia. Among their fellow passengers on the boat were 26 Moravians who\r\nmade much of the singing of hymns and seemed to meet every storm and\r\ntrial with unfaltering faith. Wesley was so impressed that on the third\r\nday out he began the study of German and soon joined in the daily\r\nworship of the Moravians. The fervor and spontaneity of their singing\r\nmade an indelible impression on his mind. He later translated a number\r\nof chorales into English.

Ray Palmer_\r\n\r\nA hymn of devotional meditation especially appropriate for the Communion\r\nService.\r\n\r\nFrom the same Latin hymn, “_Jesu dulcis memoria_,” as Hymn 155 (which\r\nsee) but using a different set of quatrains, Nos. 4, 3, 20, 28, and 10,\r\nwhich appear in the Latin as follows:\r\n\r\n  Jesu, dulcedo cordium;\r\n  Fons veri, lumen mentium,\r\n  Excedit omne gaudium,\r\n  Et omne desiderium.\r\n\r\n  Jesus, spes poenitentibus,\r\n  Quam pius es petentibus,\r\n  Quam bonus te quaerentibus!\r\n  Sed quid invenientibus?\r\n\r\n  Qui te gustant, esuriunt;\r\n  Qui bibunt, adhuc sitiunt:\r\n  Desiderare nesciunt\r\n  Nisi Jesum, quem diligunt.\r\n\r\n  Quoconque loco fuero,\r\n  Mecum Jesum desidero;\r\n  Quam laetus, cum invenero!\r\n  Quam felix, cum tenuero!\r\n\r\n  Mane nobiscum, Domine,\r\n  Et nos illustra lumine,\r\n  Pulsa mentis caligine,\r\n  Mundum replens dulcedine.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, Ray Palmer, see Hymn 131.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ QUEBEC. This tune by Henry Baker was originally set to the\r\nhymn, “Sun of my soul.” It is also called “Hesperus” and “Whitburn.”\r\n\r\nHenry Baker (not to be confused with Henry W. Baker), 1835-1910, son of\r\nRev. James Baker, was educated as a civil engineer and spent many years\r\nin his profession on railroad work in India. He loved music, and,\r\nencouraged by John B. Dykes, proceeded in 1867 to his musical degree\r\n(Mus. Bac.) at Exeter College, Oxford.\r\n\r\n\r\n172. O love divine, that stooped to share       _Oliver Wendell Holmes_,\r\n                                                                 1809-94\r\n\r\nOne of Holmes’ best hymns to which he gave the title, “Hymn of Trust.”\r\nIt is found in the author’s _Poems_, 1862. It was first published as one\r\nof the poems in _The Professor at the Breakfast Table_, where it was\r\nrepresented as having been heard by the professor as he walked by a sick\r\nroom. The little refrain, “Thou art near,” is based on Psalm 119:151:\r\n“Thou art near, O Lord; and all thy commandments are truth.”\r\n\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes, American poet and man of letters, was the son of\r\nRev. Abiel Holmes, a Congregational minister. He graduated from Harvard\r\nin 1829, studied medicine at home and abroad, and became Professor of\r\nAnatomy and Physiology at Dartmouth in 1838. He was elected to the same\r\nchair at Harvard in 1847, a position he filled with distinction for 35\r\nyears. During all his years of teaching he was also engaged in literary\r\nwork and published many volumes. Holmes was chief founder of the\r\n_Atlantic Monthly_. He was a member of the Unitarian Church though in\r\nlater years he fell back for spiritual comfort on the great evangelical\r\nhymns of Watts and Wesley, finding in them a source of satisfaction and\r\npower which the hymns of his own denomination failed to supply. His son,\r\nOliver Wendell, Jr., became an eminent member of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Holmes see Hymn 53.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ QUEBEC. For comments on this tune see Hymn 171.\r\n\r\n\r\n173. Immortal Love, forever full      _John Greenleaf Whittier_, 1807-92\r\n\r\nOne of the great hymns on the living presence and sympathy of Christ. It\r\nis taken from the poem, “Our Master,” of 38 stanzas, of which this hymn\r\nis a selection of stanzas 1, 5, 13, 14, and 16 of the original.\r\n\r\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier, the “Quaker Poet,” was born near Haverhill,\r\nMass., where he began life as a farm boy and village shoemaker. At the\r\nage of 20, with only a limited education, he entered the profession of\r\njournalism, largely as the result of becoming acquainted with William\r\nLloyd Garrison. He became editor of the _American Manufacturer_ in 1828,\r\nand of the _New England Review_ in 1830. In 1836 he became the secretary\r\nof the American Anti-Slavery Society and editor of its official organ,\r\nthe _Freeman_. Whittier was a staunch advocate of the freedom of slaves,\r\nand as a Quaker, he was just as strongly opposed to war. His poems are\r\ncharacterized by wide sympathy and a fervent love for God and man.\r\nThough a staunch Quaker, wearing the distinctive garb and using the\r\nQuaker mode of speech all his life, there was no narrow sectarianism in\r\nhis heart. A letter written to friends in Whittier, California, a city\r\nnamed after the poet, for the dedication of the Protestant Episcopal\r\nChurch at that place, illustrates his large-hearted religious views:\r\n\r\n  I see the good in all denominations, and hope that all will be\r\n  represented in the settlement; ... diligent in business and serving\r\n  the Lord, not wasting strength and vitality in spasmodic emotions, not\r\n  relying on creed and dogma, but upon faithful obedience to the voice\r\n  of God in the soul. I see your town is spoken of as an orthodox Quaker\r\n  colony. I hope there will be no sectarian fence about “Whittier,” but\r\n  that good men, irrespective of their creeds, will find a home there.\r\n  Nothing would be worse for it than to have the idea get abroad that\r\n  anything like intolerance and self-righteousness was its foundation. I\r\n  am gratified to know that the people of the town which bears my name\r\n  will remember me on my birthday. I watch its growth with great\r\n  interest. It has the reputation among all who have seen it that it\r\n  occupies one of the loveliest sites in California, and that in a moral\r\n  and religious and educational point of view it need\r\n\r\n  Fear not the skeptic’s puny hand\r\n  While near the school the church will stand;\r\n  Nor fear the blinded bigot’s rule\r\n  While near the church shall stand the school.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SERENITY is taken from a larger work entitled, _Waft ye winds_.\r\nThough the tune is named “Serenity,” the composer’s life was anything\r\nbut serene; he was the world’s most restless and most picturesque\r\ncomposer. William Vincent Wallace, 1812-65, son of an Irish bandmaster,\r\nbecame a brilliant violinist. He loved adventure and travel and made\r\nsuccessful concert tours to Australia, the South Sea Islands, India,\r\nSouth America, Mexico, the United States, and elsewhere. Wallace spent\r\n14 years in Germany composing piano music chiefly, but also writing a\r\nnumber of operas. On account of failing health, he abandoned writing,\r\nand went to New York where he lost all his fortune through the failure\r\nof a piano factory. Undiscouraged by this disaster, he once more resumed\r\nhis career as composer, returned to London, and then on doctor’s orders\r\nwent to the Pyrenees where he died at the age of 51.\r\n\r\n\r\n174. Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost       _Christopher Wordsworth_, 1807-85\r\n\r\nWritten for one of the pre-Lenten Sundays (_Quinquagesima_), the lesson\r\nfor the day being I Corinthians 13. It is a fine enough hymn, but no\r\npoet can render this great paean of praise of love into verse to equal\r\nin poetic beauty the English of the King James Version.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wordsworth was a nephew of the poet William Wordsworth. He\r\nwas a brilliant student and a good athlete. After graduation from\r\nCambridge, he became Head Master of Harrow for a time, then minister of\r\na church where he proved to be a model parish priest, and later was\r\nappointed Bishop of Lincoln. Among his writings are a _Commentary on the\r\nBible_, and a book of devotional poetry, _The Holy Year_, prepared for\r\nuse in public worship.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CAPETOWN is an adaptation of a melody in “_Vierstimmiges\r\nChoralbuch herausgegeben von Dr. F. Filitz_,” Berlin, 1847. It was\r\noriginally set to the hymn, “_Morgenglanz der Ewigkeit_” (554).\r\n\r\nThe composer, Friedrich Filitz, 1804-76, was a musician and editor of\r\nGerman chorale books. He spent all his life in Munich except the years\r\n1843-47 in Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n175. O Love that wilt not let me go         _George Matheson_, 1842-1906\r\n\r\nA song of joyful resignation, love, and trust, born out of the author’s\r\nexperience of suffering. The story has been circulated that the hymn was\r\nwritten after the woman whom Matheson loved gave him up because of his\r\nbecoming blind—a good story with one defect, _viz._, that it isn’t true.\r\nIt could not be true because Matheson became blind at 15 and the hymn\r\nwas not written until he was 40 years old.\r\n\r\nThe author’s own account of the composition of the hymn is as follows:\r\n\r\n  My hymn was composed in the manse of Innellan, on the evening of June\r\n  6, 1882. I was at that time alone. It was the day of my sister’s\r\n  marriage, and the rest of the family were staying over night in\r\n  Glasgow. Something had happened to me, which was known only to myself,\r\n  and which caused me the most severe mental suffering. The hymn was the\r\n  fruit of that suffering. It was the quickest bit of work I ever did in\r\n  my life. I had the impression rather of having it dictated to me by\r\n  some inward voice than of working it out myself. I am quite sure that\r\n  the whole work was completed in five minutes, and equally sure that it\r\n  never received at my hands any retouching or correction. The Hymnal\r\n  Committee of the Church of Scotland desired the change of one word. I\r\n  had written originally “I climb the rainbow in the rain.” They\r\n  objected to the word “climb” and I put in “trace.”\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Matheson, son of a wealthy merchant in Glasgow, was an able\r\nand greatly honored minister in the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. He\r\nwas educated at Glasgow University and licensed to preach when 24 years\r\nold. During his University course, and all the rest of his life, he had\r\nto depend on the eyesight of others, which makes his accomplishments all\r\nthe more remarkable. He was a brilliant student and became a\r\ndistinguished preacher and pastor. At St. Bernard’s Church, Edinburgh,\r\nhe served a membership of over 2,000, never neglecting his duties of\r\npastoral calling in which he was invariably accompanied by his devoted\r\nsister. He was a scholar of distinction and was the author of 25 books,\r\nincluding such well-known works as _Representative Men of the Bible_,\r\n_Representative Women of the Bible_, _The Spiritual Development of St.\r\nPaul_, and a book of _Sacred Songs_. Of the many hymns he wrote, several\r\nhave been used in hymn books but only this one has gained universal\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. MARGARET was written one summer day as the composer was\r\nsitting by the sea on the island of Arran and reading over Matheson’s\r\nverses. The tune came to him suddenly and he hastened to the house where\r\nhe was staying where (in his own words): “I wrote the music straight\r\noff, and I may say that the ink of the first note was hardly dry when I\r\nfinished the tune.”\r\n\r\nThe composer, Albert Lister Peace, 1844-1912, was organist at Glasgow\r\nCathedral and at the time he wrote this tune, he was music editor of the\r\nrevised _Scottish Hymnal_ of 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n176. For common gifts we bless Thee, Lord         _Charlotte M. Packard_\r\n\r\nA hymn of gratitude for the common gifts too often taken for granted—the\r\nphysical senses, the air, sun, darkness and sleep, the courtesies of\r\nfriendship, etc. The last stanza is a prayer for unforgetful gratitude.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding the author, Charlotte M. Packard, has not been\r\ntraced. The hymn was taken from _Hymns of the Spirit_, 1937, Boston.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ILLSLEY appeared in _A Sett of New Psalm Tunes in Four Parts by\r\nJohn Bishop_, c. 1700, where it is set to Psalm 100.\r\n\r\nJohn Bishop, the composer, 1665-1737, was an English musician who became\r\norganist of Winchester College in 1695 and in 1729 was appointed\r\norganist of Winchester Chapel. He is buried in the Cloisters of the\r\nCollege with the following epitaph:\r\n\r\n  Vir singulari probitate, integerrima vita, moribus innocuis,\r\n  musicaeque scientiae bene peritus, qui, postquam huic Collegio per\r\n  XLII, annos sedulo inserviisset, ad Caelestam Choram placide migravit,\r\n  decimo nono die Decembris, anno Dom. 1737, Aetat. 72. (A man of\r\n  unexampled honesty, purest life, blameless morals, and of excellent\r\n  skill in music, who, after serving this College diligently for 42\r\n  years, passed tranquilly to the Celestial Choir on the 19th of\r\n  December A.D. 1737, aged 72.)\r\n\r\n\r\n177. My God, I thank Thee, who hast made        _Adelaide Anne Proctor_,\r\n                                                                 1825-64\r\n\r\nA hymn of pure gratitude, expressing thankfulness even for the trials of\r\nlife. It is equally useful for the sick and the well.\r\n\r\nAdelaide Anne Proctor was born in London, the daughter of Bryan W.\r\nProctor, known in literary circles as “Barry Cornwall.” She possessed\r\nextraordinary intellectual power and was specially gifted in music and\r\nlanguage. Miss Proctor contributed lyrics to _Household Verses_, edited\r\nby Chas. Dickens, who wrote with admiration of her verse making, her\r\nmental resources, humor, and works of beneficence. At 38 years of age\r\nher physical strength weakened and then followed 15 weary months of\r\nhelplessness during which, however, she maintained her old cheerfulness\r\nwith never a trace of depression or regret. She was brought up in the\r\nChurch of England, but at the age of 26 united with the Roman Catholics.\r\nHer broad sympathies and deep religious convictions placed her above the\r\ndogmas of any one communion and enabled her to express the aspirations\r\nof all God’s children. Besides her hymns, Miss Proctor is best known as\r\nthe author of the popular song, “The Lost Chord,” set to music by Arthur\r\nSullivan.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WENTWORTH was composed for this hymn in _The Bristol Tune\r\nBook_, 2d series; 1876. The middle section of the tune, lines 3 and 4,\r\npasses from the Key of C to A minor, D major and G major, making an\r\neffective contrast to the opening and closing lines, in the key of C.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Frederick C. Maker, see Hymn 112.\r\n\r\n\r\n178-9. Love divine, all loves excelling        _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nThe hymn appeared in the curiously named collection, _Hymns for those\r\nthat seek and those that have Redemption in the Blood of Christ_, 1747,\r\nand was entitled “Jesu, show us Thy salvation.” It dwells upon the\r\nthought of God as love, an idea not too common in the early hymns. The\r\nthought of the hymn is complete without stanza 2 and many hymnals omit\r\nit. Some have objected to this stanza because of the line, “Take away\r\nour power of sinning.” Literally interpreted this would be a prayer to\r\nhave taken away the power of free moral choice, which is hardly what\r\nWesley intended. To obviate this difficulty, the line has been changed\r\nto “Take away the _love_ of sinning.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BEECHER was composed by John Zundel, 1815-82, German-American\r\norganist and composer who rendered distinguished service as minister of\r\nmusic in the Plymouth Congregation Church, Brooklyn, of which Henry Ward\r\nBeecher was pastor. He assisted Beecher in the production of the famous\r\n_Plymouth Collection_ of hymns published in 1855. The tune, now known\r\nthroughout the world, was named after the great pulpiteer.\r\n\r\nSONATA (179) is an adaptation of the theme-melody in Mozart’s piano\r\nSonata No. 16, where it is marked, _Andantino grazioso_. Dudley Buck\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 1756-91, composed 972 pieces of which we\r\n  know. He is considered the greatest composer the world has ever seen,\r\n  judged by the versatility and power of his genius. In every sort and\r\n  kind of composition he was equally excellent. Beside being a great\r\n  composer he was also a great performer, being the most accomplished\r\n  pianist of his day. He was also an excellent player on the violin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PRAYER AND COMMUNION\r\n\r\n\r\n180. Pray when the morn is breaking   _Mrs. Jane Cross Simpson_, 1811-86\r\n                                                            _and others_\r\n\r\nA hymn setting forth the idea of prayer in a very simple way.\r\n\r\nJane Cross Simpson was the daughter of James Bell, a Glasgow attorney.\r\nIn 1837, she married her cousin J. B. Simpson, of Glasgow. At the age of\r\n20, she had written a poem, “Go when the morning shineth,” which, after\r\nsome revision, had become popular. When _Songs of Praise_, an important\r\nEnglish hymnbook, was in the making, this poem was again revised to make\r\nthe present hymn. The “others” referred to are responsible for the\r\nrevision and according to _Songs of Praise Discussed_ consisted of Percy\r\nDearmer, Stephen Gwynn, Mabel Dearmer, and Jan Struther.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MEIRIONYDD is a vigorous tune of easy rhythm, on the pattern of\r\nmany Welsh tunes except that the last two lines, instead of being simple\r\nrepeats of the first two lines, as in the majority of such melodies, are\r\nvaried imitations of them.\r\n\r\nThe composer, William Lloyd, 1786-1852, a Welshman, was a self-educated\r\nman. Though a cattle-dealing farmer, he possessed an excellent voice and\r\nhad a considerable knowledge of music. He held singing meetings and\r\nconducted music classes in Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n181. Dear Lord and Father of mankind          _John Greenleaf Whittier_,\r\n                                                                 1807-92\r\n\r\nA song of quietude and peace, reflecting the inner life of the “Quaker\r\nPoet.”\r\n\r\nThe verses are from a poem called, “The Brewing of Soma,” in which\r\nWhittier tells of a certain sect of devotees in India who drank\r\nintoxicating liquor brewed from the Soma plant. The drinking of it\r\nbrought them to a state of intoxicated excitement in which they imagined\r\nthey were god-possessed. The poet then points out how among Christians\r\nemotional excitement is often mistaken for spiritual power.\r\n\r\n  “In sensual transports, wild as vain,\r\n  We brew in many a Christian fane,\r\n  The heathen Soma still.”\r\n\r\nThen follow the beautiful verses of our hymn in praise of the higher\r\nlife of restfulness in God. The poem was written in 1832, after a\r\nparticularly noisy and distasteful revival in Whittier’s neighborhood.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Greenleaf Whittier see Hymn 173.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WHITTIER, also called “Rest” and “Elton,” was written for this\r\nhymn.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Frederick C. Maker, see Hymn 112.\r\n\r\n\r\n182. Sweet hour of prayer                           _William W. Walford_\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular of all modern prayer meeting hymns, sometimes\r\nerroneously ascribed to Fanny Crosby. It was composed in 1842 by Rev.\r\nWilliam W. Walford, a blind minister of England, of whom little is known\r\nexcept that he recited the words of this hymn to Rev. Thos. Salmon,\r\nCongregational minister at Coleshill, England, who wrote them down and\r\nlater sent them to the New York _Observer_, in which publication they\r\nwere printed September 13, 1845. The original has four stanzas, the last\r\ntwo being omitted here.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CONSOLATION, a tune well suited to the words, was composed by\r\nWm. B. Bradbury in 1859. It is also known as “Sweet Hour” and “Walford.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Wm. B. Bradbury, see Hymn 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n183. Lord, what a change within us one short hour            _Richard C.\r\n                                                        Trench_, 1807-86\r\n                                             _Arr. W. P. Merrill_, 1867—\r\n\r\nA hymn of the peace and power available through the practice of prayer.\r\nIt is an arrangement of Trench’s sonnet on “Prayer.”\r\n\r\nRichard Chenevix Trench was born in Dublin, educated at Twyford School,\r\nHarrow, and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was preacher, poet, professor\r\nof divinity and later the Archbishop of Dublin. Trench, a scholar of\r\ndistinction, is the author of valuable books, including _Notes on the\r\nParables_, _Notes on the Miracles_, and _Study of Words_.\r\n\r\nThe poem came into the hymn books through the arrangement made of it by\r\nDr. W. P. Merrill who first became acquainted with the sonnet through\r\nhearing it read about 1907 by President Charles Cuthbert Hall, of Union\r\nTheological Seminary in the course of a lecture at the University of\r\nChicago. As sonnets each have fourteen lines, changes were necessary to\r\nmake the poem suitable for singing. Dr. Merrill omitted two lines and\r\narranged the rest to make three symmetrical four-line stanzas.\r\n\r\nWilliam Pearson Merrill was born in Orange, N. J., January 10, 1867.\r\nAfter graduating from Rutgers College, he trained for the Presbyterian\r\nministry at Union Theological Seminary, New York. He served churches in\r\nPhiladelphia and Chicago and then went, in 1911, to the Brick\r\nPresbyterian Church in New York City to begin a long and distinguished\r\npastorate which ended with his retirement in 1938. He was president of\r\nthe Church Peace Union, was long active in The American Hymn Society,\r\nand is the author of several books. His influence as preacher and\r\nreligious leader extends beyond his own denomination.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FFIGYSBREN, known in Wales as “Clod” (Praise), is a tune of\r\nsimple construction, but when sung rather slowly it is remarkably\r\npowerful and effective. It appeared in America in _The Harvard\r\nUniversity Hymn Book_, edited by Archibald T. Davidson in 1926. It is\r\none of an increasing number of Welsh tunes which are becoming available\r\nto enrich our hymnody with the element of unique beauty and fervor that\r\nis so characteristic of the singing of the Welsh people.\r\n\r\n\r\n184. Prayer is the soul’s sincere desire   _James Montgomery_, 1771-1854\r\n\r\nA classic poem on prayer, written in 1818 at the request of the Rev. E.\r\nBickersteth for his _Treatise on Prayer_. In 1825 it was published in\r\n_The Christian Psalmist_, headed, “What is Prayer?” The original has\r\neight stanzas of which our hymn is a selection of 1, 2, 4, 5. Prayer is\r\nmore, to be sure, than “the soul’s sincere desire,” for we sincerely\r\ndesire many things that are in conflict with God’s will. But taken as a\r\nwhole, the poem is an elaborate description of the nature of prayer and\r\nteaches its principles and practice with truth and power. The last\r\nstanza, unfortunately omitted in the _Hymnary_, is itself a beautiful,\r\ndirect petition:\r\n\r\n  O Thou by whom we come to God,\r\n    The Life, the Truth, the Way,\r\n  The path of prayer Thyself hast trod,—\r\n    Lord, teach us how to pray.\r\n\r\nFor comments on James Montgomery see Hymn 62.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. AGNES. For comments on this tune see Hymn 155. In some\r\nbooks the hymn is set to the tune “_Es Ist Ein Born_” (241).\r\n\r\n\r\n185. Thou art the Way, to Thee alone        _George W. Doane_, 1799-1859\r\n\r\nBased on John 14:6: “I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man\r\ncometh unto the Father, but by me.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written by one of the most able and influential men in the\r\nEpiscopal Church in America. It takes high rank among all the hymns\r\nAmerica has produced, and is one of the few hymns of American origin\r\nincluded in the famous English book, _Hymns Ancient and Modern_. It is\r\nwritten in simple style, employing only twelve words of more than one\r\nsyllable.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Bishop Doane see Hymn 36.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LAMBETH was composed in 1871 by Wilhelm A. F. Schulthes. No\r\ninformation is at hand concerning the composer. The tune was taken from\r\n_The Hymnal_ (Protestant Episcopal, 1916).\r\n\r\n\r\n186. What a friend we have in Jesus            _Joseph Scriven_, 1820-86\r\n\r\nA spiritual song of comfort and hope and the most popular Canadian\r\ncontribution to the hymnody of the church.\r\n\r\nThe authorship of this hymn long remained a secret. In one publication\r\nit was erroneously attributed to Horatius Bonar. Scriven composed it for\r\nhis mother to comfort her in time of special sorrow, not intending that\r\nanyone else should see it. This information was revealed to a friend who\r\nsat up with the author in his last illness.\r\n\r\nJoseph Scriven, born in Dublin, came to Canada at the age of 25 and\r\nsettled first at Rice Lake and later at Port Hope, Ontario. He was\r\nunmarried and lived with several families in succession. An eccentric\r\nperson, he was always assisting others, and was known as “the man who\r\nsawed wood for widows and sick people who are unable to pay.” He was\r\nfound drowned in a stream near Rice Lake. A monument to his memory was\r\nerected by the people who had been helped by him, and by others in the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ERIE was composed for this hymn by Charles Crozat Converse,\r\n1832-1918, an American, trained in Germany for the musical profession.\r\nOn returning to America, he studied law, graduating from Albany Law\r\nSchool in 1861, and from 1875 practicing the legal profession at Erie,\r\nPa. He maintained his interest in music and published several\r\ncompositions during his career as lawyer.\r\n\r\n\r\n187. I need Thee every hour            _Annie Sherwood Hawks_, 1835-1918\r\n\r\nA song expressing the Christian believer’s ever-present sense of divine\r\nhelp and guidance. It first appeared in a small collection of gospel\r\nsongs prepared for the National Baptist Sunday School Association which\r\nmet in Cincinnati, Ohio, November, 1872, and was sung there.\r\n\r\nMrs. Annie Sherwood Hawks was an active member of the Baptist Church in\r\nBrooklyn of which Rev. Robert Lowry, who wrote the music to the words\r\nand added the refrain, was the pastor. Concerning the hymn, Mrs. Hawks\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n  Whenever my attention is called to it I am conscious of great\r\n  satisfaction in the thought that I was permitted to write the hymn, “I\r\n  need Thee every hour,” and that it was wafted out to the world on the\r\n  wings of love and joy, rather than under stress of a great personal\r\n  sorrow, with which it has so often been associated in the minds of\r\n  those who sing it.\r\n\r\n  I remember well the morning ... when in the midst of the daily cares\r\n  of my home ... I was so filled with the sense of nearness to the\r\n  Master that, wondering how one could live without Him either in joy or\r\n  pain, these words, “I need Thee every hour,” were ushered into my\r\n  mind, the thought at once taking full possession of me....\r\n\r\n  For myself the hymn was prophetic rather than expressive of my own\r\n  experience at the time it was written, and I do not understand why it\r\n  so touched the great throbbing heart of humanity. It was not until\r\n  long years after, when the shadow fell over my way—the shadow of a\r\n  great loss—that I understood something of the comforting in the words\r\n  I had been permitted to write and give out to others in my hours of\r\n  sweet security and peace.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NEED. The tune was written for this hymn. The composer, Rev.\r\nRobert Lowry, 1826-99, was born in Philadelphia and educated at Bucknell\r\nUniversity. After a few years in the Baptist ministry he became\r\nProfessor of Rhetoric at his alma mater. The University gave him his\r\ndoctorate in 1875. He resigned his chair in 1875 and the following year\r\nresumed the work of the ministry at Plainfield, N. J., continuing until\r\nhis death. Though he had no serious training in music, Lowry wrote many\r\ntunes and edited several popular collections of hymns. He did much to\r\nencourage the gospel song movement in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n188. Father, in Thy mysterious presence kneeling       _Samuel Johnson_,\r\n                                                                 1822-82\r\n\r\nA beautiful hymn of contrition, and prayer for the “Presence.”\r\n\r\nSamuel Johnson was born in Salem, Mass. After graduating from Harvard\r\nUniversity and Harvard Divinity School, he became minister of the\r\nIndependent Church at Lynn, Mass., where he served from 1853 to 1870. He\r\nwas a fellow-student and close friend of Samuel Longfellow, the two\r\n“Sams” collaborating in the editing of _A Book of Hymns_ which passed\r\nthrough twelve editions and became the source of excellent hymnic\r\nmaterial not published before. He was a Unitarian by faith. A competent\r\nscholar, he published _Oriental Religions_, the first adequate study of\r\ncomparative religions by an American.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HENLEY is one of Mason’s most appreciated tunes. It appeared in\r\n_The Hallelujah_, 1854, by the composer, set to the hymn “Come unto me,\r\nwhen shadows darkly gather.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Lowell Mason see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n189. Come, thou Fount of every blessing       _Robert Robinson_, 1735-90\r\n\r\nAn old hymn that has been a “fount of blessing” itself to multitudes,\r\nwritten only three years after the author’s conversion. It sounds a note\r\nof anxiety lest the paths of sin lure the soul away from God. The\r\nScripture reference in the second stanza is to I Sam. 7:12: “Then Samuel\r\ntook a stone and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of\r\nit Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped me.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Robert Robinson, see Hymn 46.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NETTLETON appeared in John Wyeth’s _Repository_, 1813, arranged\r\nwith the melody in the treble. The authorship of the tune is unknown. It\r\nhas been attributed to Wyeth and to Asahel Nettleton, 1783-1844, a New\r\nEngland evangelist and compiler of _Village Hymns_. It has been\r\nsuggested that a friend of Nettleton composed the tune and named it in\r\nhis honor.\r\n\r\nJohn Wyeth was born in Cambridge, Mass., 1770, and followed the printing\r\nand publishing business all his life. He was postmaster at Harrisburg,\r\nPa., under President Washington but was removed by President Adams\r\nbecause of “incompatibility of the office of post master and editor of a\r\nnewspaper.” He died in Philadelphia, June 23, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       LOYALTY AND STEADFASTNESS\r\n\r\n\r\n190. Who is on the Lord’s side            _Frances R. Havergal_, 1836-79\r\n\r\nAn impressive call to Christian service. The hymn is based on the\r\nincident in the life of David in I Chron. 12:18: “Then the spirit came\r\nupon Amasai who was the chief of the captains, and he said, ‘Thine are\r\nwe, David, and on thy side’.... Then David received them and made them\r\ncaptains of the band.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Frances Havergal see Hymn 126.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ARMAGEDDON. This stirring tune was first used to “Onward,\r\nChristian Soldiers,” and later with the above hymn. It is an arrangement\r\nby John Goss of a tune by Louise Reichardt which appeared in _Kern des\r\nDeutschen Kirchengesangs_, 1853.\r\n\r\nLouise Reichardt, 1788-1826, was a teacher of vocal music in Berlin.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Goss see Hymn 121.\r\n\r\n\r\n191. When courage fails, and faith burns low      _Frederick L. Hosmer_,\r\n                                                               1840-1929\r\n\r\nA triumphant song setting forth the ultimate victory of truth, and\r\nencouraging young people to stand loyally for the truth, even “though\r\nmen deride.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Frederick L. Hosmer, see Hymn 72.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WINCHESTER OLD. For comments on this tune see Hymn 588.\r\n\r\n\r\n192. Jesus, and shall it ever be              _Joseph B. Grigg_, 1720-68\r\n\r\nEntitled by the author “Ashamed of Me.” The hymn is based on Mark 8:38:\r\n“Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this\r\nadulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be\r\nashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy\r\nangels.”\r\n\r\nThe original poem, composed when the author was only ten years of age,\r\nhas been altered somewhat by Benjamin Francis, an English Baptist\r\npreacher who was born in Wales in 1734. Francis was an earnest and\r\npopular minister and received flattering calls to London and elsewhere\r\nbut chose to remain with his flock at the Baptist Church at Shortwood\r\nwhere he ministered from 1757 until his death in 1799.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Joseph B. Grigg see Hymn 141.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FEDERAL STREET is the name of a street in Salem, Mass., where\r\nthe composer lived and where his wife was born, lived, and died. The\r\ntune was written in 1832 to a child’s funeral hymn by Anne Steele, which\r\nbegan, “So fades the lovely, blooming flower.”\r\n\r\nHenry Kemble Oliver, 1800-85, was a great lover of music even though his\r\nfather disapproved of music and forbade the son having anything to do\r\nwith it. After graduating from Dartmouth, he had a varied career as\r\nteacher, manager of cotton mills, adjutant-general of his state,\r\ntreasurer of the State of Massachusetts, and mayor of Salem. He had\r\nacquired some musical education and found time to compose and publish a\r\nconsiderable amount of sacred music.\r\n\r\n\r\n193. Stand up, stand up for Jesus        _George Duffield, Jr._, 1818-88\r\n\r\nA hymn of the Christian warfare, widely known, and found in nearly all\r\nEnglish hymn books. The origin of it is best given in the author’s own\r\nwords in a leaflet printed in Detroit, 1883, and quoted by his son,\r\nSamuel Duffield, in _English Hymns_, 1886:\r\n\r\n  “Stand up for Jesus” was the dying message of the Rev. Dudley A. Tyng,\r\n  to the Young Men’s Christian Association, and the ministers associated\r\n  with them in the Noon-Day Prayer Meeting, during the great revival of\r\n  1858, usually known as “The Work of God in Philadelphia.”\r\n\r\n  A very dear personal friend, I knew young Tyng as one of the noblest,\r\n  bravest, manliest men I ever met; not inferior in eloquence to his\r\n  honored father, and the acknowledged leader of a campaign for Christ\r\n  that has become historical. The Sabbath before his death he preached\r\n  in the immense edifice known as Jaynes’ Hall, one of the most\r\n  successful sermons of modern times. Of the five thousand men there\r\n  assembled, at least one thousand, it was believed, were “the slain of\r\n  the Lord.” His text was Exodus 10:11, and hence the allusion in the\r\n  third verse of the hymn.\r\n\r\n  The following Wednesday, leaving his study for a moment, he went to\r\n  the barn floor, where a mule was at work on a horse-power, shelling\r\n  corn. Patting him on the neck, the sleeve of his silk study gown\r\n  caught in the cogs of the wheel, and his arm was torn out by the\r\n  roots! His death occurred in a few hours. Never was there greater\r\n  lamentation over a young man than over him, and when Gen. 50:26 was\r\n  announced as the text for his funeral sermon, the place at once became\r\n  a Bochim, and continued so for many minutes.\r\n\r\n  The following Sunday the author of the hymn preached from Eph. 6:14,\r\n  and the above verses were written simply as the concluding\r\n  exhortation. The superintendent of the Sabbath-school had a fly-leaf\r\n  printed for the children—a stray copy found its way into a Baptist\r\n  newspaper—and from that paper it has gone in English, and in German\r\n  and Latin translations all over the world. The first time the author\r\n  heard it sung outside of his own denomination, was in 1864, as the\r\n  favorite song of the Christian soldiers in the Army of the James.\r\n\r\n                                                     ... George Duffield\r\n\r\n  Detroit, May 29, 1883.\r\n\r\nGeorge Duffield, Jr., 1818-88, son of Rev. George Duffield, was educated\r\nat Yale and Union Theological Seminary for the Presbyterian ministry and\r\nheld pastorates in Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Galesburg, Ill., Adrian and\r\nLansing, Michigan. His son, Samuel W. Duffield, was the author of\r\n_English Hymns_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WEBB. For comments on this tune see Hymn 65.\r\n\r\n\r\n194. God’s trumpet wakes the slumb’ring world       _Samuel Longfellow_,\r\n                                                                 1819-92\r\n\r\nA stirring call to a loyal stand for truth and witness against wrong.\r\nThe hymn first appeared in _Hymns of the Spirit_, 1864.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Samuel Longfellow see Hymn 28.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ALL SAINTS NEW was written for Bishop Heber’s hymn, “The Son of\r\nGod goes forth to war.”\r\n\r\nThe composer, Henry Stephen Cutler, 1824-1902, received his education at\r\nBoston, his birthplace, and in Europe. He became a well-known organist\r\nand choir master, serving churches in Boston, New York, and other\r\ncities, and attracted attention by robing his choir members and seating\r\nthem in the chancel, innovations in his day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TRIALS AND TEMPTATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n195. In the hour of trial                  _James Montgomery_, 1771-1854\r\n                             _Alt. Frances A. Hutton and Godfrey Thring_\r\n\r\nThe hymn is based on Luke 22:32: “I have prayed for thee, that thy faith\r\nfail not.” It was written October 13, 1834, with the title, “In trial\r\nand temptation,” and published in 1853 in Montgomery’s _Original Hymns_\r\nunder the title “Prayers on Pilgrimage.” The third and fourth stanzas\r\nhave been altered considerably, not entirely for the better. Montgomery\r\nbegan the second stanza:\r\n\r\n  With its witching pleasures.\r\n\r\nIn the first stanza he had\r\n\r\n  Jesus _pray_ for me;\r\n\r\nto which there was much objection on scriptural grounds, in spite of the\r\nwords of Christ, “I pray for them” (John 17:9).\r\n\r\nFor comments on James Montgomery see Hymn 62.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PENITENCE was composed by Spencer Lane, 1843-1903, who received\r\nmusical training in the Boston Conservatory of Music and became a\r\nteacher of vocal and instrumental music. He was in charge of music in\r\nvarious churches in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Maryland.\r\nWhile choirmaster at St. James Church, Woonsocket, R. I., he wrote this\r\ntune one Sunday while his wife was preparing dinner. It was used at a\r\nparish choir festival on “Easter Tuesday, 1899, at 7:30 p.m.” and at the\r\nsuggestion of the rector of the church, it was sent to Dr. Chas. L.\r\nHutchins, who included it in the _Episcopal Hymnal_ of 1879. Of the\r\nvarious tunes composed by Lane, this is the only one in general use\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n196. Lord Jesus, think on me                    _Synesius_, _c._ 375-430\r\n                                       _Tr. Allen W. Chatfield_, 1808-96\r\n\r\nA subjective and meditative hymn of trust, coming to us from the ancient\r\nEastern Church.\r\n\r\nSynesius, a native of Cyrene, came from an illustrious family. He\r\nstudied at Alexandria and became a Christian in 401. Against his own\r\nwishes, but in response to the will of the people, he was elected bishop\r\nof Ptolemais. He is described in Chas. Kingsley’s _Hypatia_ as a\r\ndistinguished churchman, philosopher, statesman, and patriot.\r\n\r\nThe translator, Rev. A. W. Chatfield, was an Anglican clergyman who had\r\na distinguished career at Cambridge. He translated many of the hymns of\r\nthe early Greek poets into English.\r\n\r\nThe original poem, of which this is a paraphrase rather than an exact\r\ntranslation, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Μνώεο, Χριστέ,\r\n  υἱὲ Θεοῖο\r\n  ὑψιµέδοντος,\r\n  οἰκέτω Σοῦ,\r\n  Κῆρ’ ἀλιτροῖο\r\n  Τάδε γράψαντος;\r\n  Καί µοι ὄρασσον\r\n  λύσιν παθέων\r\n  κηριτρεφέων\r\n  τά µοι ἐµφυῆ\r\n  ψυχᾷ ῥυπαρᾷ;\r\n  δὸς δὲ ἰδέσθαι,\r\n  Σῶτερ Ἰησοῦ,\r\n  ζαθέαν αἴγλαν\r\n  Σάν, ἔνθα φανεὶς\r\n  µέλψω ἀοιδὰν\r\n  παίονι ψυχᾶν,\r\n  παίονι γυίων,\r\n  Πατρὶ σὺν µεγάλῳ\r\n  Πνεύµατί Θ’ Ἁγνῷ.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SOUTHWELL, a characteristic psalm tune, was set to Psalm 45 in\r\n_Damon’s Psalms of David_, 1579, and was named “Southwell” in\r\nRavencroft’s _Psalm Book_ of 1621. It was originally written in the\r\nDorian mode (the first “authentic” Gregorian mode, D as keynote). A\r\nfuller explanation may be found in the _History of Music in the Western\r\nChurch_, by Dickinson, pp. 113 ff.\r\n\r\nFor comments on _Damon’s Psalter_ see Hymn 589.\r\n\r\n\r\n197. O for a closer walk with God            _William Cowper_, 1731-1800\r\n\r\nA tender, beautiful hymn, in use wherever English is spoken.\r\n\r\nIt was published in the _Olney Hymns_ (See 60) under the title “Walking\r\nwith God.” It is based on Genesis 5:24: “Enoch walked with God.” The\r\nhymn was written December 9, 1769, during the serious illness of the\r\npoet’s dear friend, the wife of Rev. Morley Unwin, in whose home he\r\nstayed and found the tenderest of care during his own illness.\r\nConcerning her, Cowper wrote in a letter the day following the\r\ncomposition of this hymn:\r\n\r\n  She is the chief of blessings I have met with in my journey since the\r\n  Lord was pleased to call me.... Her illness has been a sharp trial to\r\n  me. Oh, that it may have a sanctified effect, that I may rejoice to\r\n  surrender up to the Lord my dearest comforts, the moment He may\r\n  require them.... I began to compose the verses yesterday morning\r\n  before daybreak but fell asleep at the end of the first two lines:\r\n  when I awaked again, the third and fourth were whispered to my heart\r\n  in a way which I have so often experienced.\r\n\r\nFor comments on William Cowper see Hymn 60.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BELMONT is an adaptation from a melody in _Sacred Melodies ...\r\nadapted to the best English poets_, Vol. I; 1812, by William Gardiner.\r\nThe _Sacred Melodies_ appeared in six volumes containing tunes by the\r\nbest masters, adapted to English words.\r\n\r\nThe composer, William Gardiner, 1770-1853, was an English stocking\r\nmanufacturer who travelled extensively at home and abroad, principally\r\nin the interests of his business, but also making acquaintance with\r\nmusicians of all ranks and with their music. He published songs and\r\nduets of his own composition in his youth, over the _nom de plume_ of\r\n“W. G. Leicester.” His _Sacred Melodies_, referred to above, did\r\nvaluable service in drawing attention to many fine compositions\r\notherwise unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n198.

It was during the period\r\nof the Revolution and the reign of terror. Being an outspoken\r\nrepublican, she was imprisoned by Robespierre, and was released only\r\nafter his death in 1794. She was a woman of extraordinary intellectual\r\nstrength and published many volumes on politics, religion, and literary\r\nquestions, and finally her collected poems, entitled, _Poems on Various\r\nOccasions_. She lived in England and in France, and the closing years of\r\nher life were spent in Holland in the home of a nephew who was pastor of\r\na Reformed Church in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BRATTLE STREET.

Robert Seagrave, was educated at Cambridge\r\nand was ordained a clergyman in the Church of England. He became\r\ninterested in the Wesleys and Whitefield and published pamphlets and\r\nsermons designed to reform the clergy and Church of England. He wrote 50\r\noriginal hymns, of which this one is still in use. The exact year of\r\nSeagrave’s death is not certain.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ AMSTERDAM is attributed to James Nares, 1715-1783, but most\r\nauthorities believe the tune to be much older. It appears in what is\r\nknown as the _Foundery Collection_, the first Methodist hymnal, by John\r\nWesley, 1742, and is said to be one of the German chorale tunes which\r\nJohn Wesley acquired from the Moravian Brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\n201. We would see Jesus                      _Anna B. Warner_, 1820-1915\r\n\r\nBased on John 12:20-23: “There were certain Greeks among them that came\r\nup to worship at the feast: the same came therefore to Philip, which was\r\nof Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see\r\nJesus.... And Jesus answered them saying, The hour is come, that the Son\r\nof man should be glorified.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn first appeared in six stanzas in _Hymns of the Church\r\nMilitant_, compiled by Anna Warner, New York, 1858, and published in\r\n1861. It is another example of a fine hymn contributed by a woman.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth stanzas, omitted here, are of the same excellent\r\nquality as the others:\r\n\r\n  We would see Jesus: other lights are paling,\r\n    Which for long years we have rejoiced to see;\r\n  The blessings of our pilgrimage are failing;\r\n    We would not mourn them for we go to Thee.\r\n\r\n  We would see Jesus: yet the spirit lingers\r\n    Round the dear objects it has loved so long,\r\n  And earth from earth can scarce unclose its fingers;\r\n    Our love to Thee makes not this love less strong.\r\n\r\nAnna Bartlett Warner, lived on Constitution Island in the Hudson River,\r\nnear West Point, where she and her more famous sister, Susan Warner,\r\nconducted a Bible class for nearly two generations for the cadets of the\r\nUnited States Military Academy. Because of this service, she was buried\r\nwith military honors upon her death in 1915. Miss Warner wrote novels\r\nunder the pseudonym of “Amy Lothrop,” but she is best known for this\r\nhymn and the song beloved of all little children, “Jesus loves me: this\r\nI know.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HENLEY.

Nearer, my God, to Thee               _Sarah Flower Adams_, 1805-48\r\n\r\nA hymn of high poetic quality which has preserved its popularity from\r\ngeneration to generation. It is based on the story of Jacob at Bethel in\r\nGen. 28:10-22:\r\n\r\n  And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. And he\r\n  lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the\r\n  sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for\r\n  his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed, and\r\n  behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to\r\n  heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on\r\n  it.... And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that\r\n  he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil\r\n  upon the top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel.\r\n\r\nSarah Flower Adams was the daughter of Benjamin Flower, an editor; she\r\nmarried William B. Adams, an engineer and inventor, in 1834. She was a\r\nmember of a Unitarian congregation in London. A woman of fine intellect,\r\nshe wrote much prose and verse, and was a friend of Robert Browning. She\r\ndied of tuberculosis, contracting the disease while caring for her\r\nsister, Eliza, who had fallen victim to the same disease two years\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BETHANY was written by Lowell Mason for this hymn. Its\r\nresemblance to the tune of the well-known “Oft in the stilly night” has\r\nbeen noted. The tune to this hymn was played by the ship’s band on board\r\nthe “Titanic” as the vessel sank on its maiden voyage, Sunday, April 14,\r\n1912, after colliding with an iceberg in the Atlantic. 1635 passengers\r\nwere lost, ending life’s voyage with the strains of the familiar and\r\nappropriate prayer resounding across the waters—“Nearer, my God, to\r\nThee.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Lowell Mason see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n203. When the weary, seeking rest              _Horatius Bonar_, 1808-89\r\n\r\nEntitled, “Intercession for All Conditions of Men,” in Bonar’s _Hymns of\r\nFaith and Hope_, 3d series, 1867.\r\n\r\nThe history of this hymn is given by the author’s son, Rev. H. N. Bonar,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  My father was asked to provide words to the music, and was especially\r\n  requested to furnish a fitting refrain to the two lovely lines of\r\n  Mendelssohn’s with which Callcott’s tune, “Intercession,” ends. In\r\n  searching for a Scripture theme containing some reiterated phrase\r\n  almost of the nature of a refrain, he was struck with Solomon’s prayer\r\n  at the dedication of the temple (2 Chron. 6) in which every separate\r\n  petition concludes with substantially the same words.\r\n\r\n  This idea was taken for his starting point, and Solomon’s words, “Hear\r\n  thou from heaven thy dwelling place and forgive,” became the familiar\r\n  couplet:\r\n\r\n  “Hear then in love, O Lord, the cry\r\n  In heaven, thy dwelling place on high.”\r\n\r\n  This foundation once provided, the rest of the hymn was built upon it.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Horatius Bonar see Hymn 129.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ INTERCESSION was composed by William H. Callcott, 1807-82, an\r\nEnglish musician. He was organist of Ely Chapel, Holborn, and afterwards\r\nof St. Barnabas’ Church, Kensington, and composed anthems and songs.\r\n\r\nThe refrain is from Mendelssohn’s oratorio, _Elijah_, part of the prayer\r\nfor rain by the prophet and the people. Bonar’s hymn was written for\r\nthis tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n204. Lord, I hear of show’rs of blessing   _Elizabeth Codner_, 1824-1919\r\n\r\nBased on Gen. 27:34: “Bless me, even me also, O my Father,” and Ezek.\r\n34:26: “There shall be showers of blessing.” It is an especially useful\r\nhymn at revival meetings.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Codner was the wife of Rev. David Codner, a clergyman of the\r\nChurch of England. She engaged in some literary work and was much\r\ninterested in the Mildmay Protestant Mission in North London.\r\n\r\nThe author has given the origin of the hymn as follows:\r\n\r\n  A party of young friends over whom I was watching with anxious hope\r\n  attended a meeting in which details were given of a revival work in\r\n  Ireland. They came back greatly impressed. My fear was lest they\r\n  should be satisfied to let their own fleece remain dry, and I pressed\r\n  upon them the privilege and responsibility of getting a share in the\r\n  out-poured blessing. On the Sunday following, not being well enough to\r\n  get out, I had a time of quiet communion. Those children were still on\r\n  my heart, and I longed to press upon them an earnest individual\r\n  appeal. Without effort words seemed to be given to me, and they took\r\n  the form of a hymn. I had no thought of sending it beyond the limits\r\n  of my own circle, but, passing it on to one and another, it became a\r\n  word of power, and I then published it as a leaflet. Of its future\r\n  history I can only say the Lord took it quite out of my own hands. It\r\n  was read from pulpits, circulated by tens of thousands, and blessed in\r\n  a remarkable degree. Every now and then some sweet token was sent to\r\n  cheer me in a somewhat isolated life, of its influence upon souls. Now\r\n  it would be tidings from afar of a young officer dying in India and\r\n  sending home his Bible with the hymn pasted on the flyleaf as the\r\n  precious memorial of that which brought him to the Lord. Then came the\r\n  story of a poor outcast gathered into the fold by the same means. Then\r\n  came to me a letter given me by Mr. E. P. Hammond, which he had\r\n  received, and in which were the words: “Thank you for singing that\r\n  hymn ‘Even Me,’ for it was the singing of that hymn that saved me. I\r\n  was a lost woman, a wicked mother. I have stolen and lied and been so\r\n  bad to my dear, innocent children. Friendless, I attended your inquiry\r\n  meeting; but no one came to me because of the crowd. But on Saturday\r\n  afternoon, at the First Presbyterian Church, when they all sang that\r\n  hymn together, those beautiful words, ‘Let some drops now fall on me,’\r\n  and also those, ‘Blessing others, O bless me,’ it seemed to reach my\r\n  very soul. I thought, ‘Jesus can accept me—“even me”’ and it brought\r\n  me to his feet, and I feel the burden of sin removed. Can you wonder\r\n  that I love those words and I love to hear them sung?”\r\n\r\n  The original rendering has in a variety of instances been departed\r\n  from. To some alterations I have consented, but always prefer that the\r\n  words remain unchanged from the form in which God so richly blessed\r\n  them. The point of the hymn, in its close and individual application,\r\n  is in the “Even me” at the end of the verse. I thankfully commit them\r\n  to whoever desires to use them in the services of our blessed Master.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EVEN ME. For comments on the composer, Wm. B. Bradbury, see\r\nHymn 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PURITY AND UPRIGHTNESS\r\n\r\n\r\n205. Blest are the pure in heart      _J. Keble_, 1792-1866 _and others_\r\n\r\nA hymn of the simple, pure life. Purity of heart has a wider meaning\r\nthan the specific virtue of chastity. Stanzas 1 and 3 are from Keble’s,\r\n_The Christian Year_, 1827. Stanzas 2 and 4 are from the _New Mitre Hymn\r\nBook_, 1836, and their authorship is uncertain. Some think they are from\r\nthe pen of the editor of the book, W. J. Hall, or of the co-editor,\r\nEdward Osler.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Keble see Hymn 22.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FRANCONIA is from a book compiled by Johann Balthasar König,\r\n_Harmonischer Lieder-Schatz_, Frankfurt-am-Main, 1738, where it is set\r\nto the hymn, _Was ist, das mich betrübt?_ The original melody may have\r\nbeen by König himself.\r\n\r\nThe present tune, arranged by Rev. W. H. Havergal, has become one of the\r\nbest known Short-Meter (6.6.8.8.) tunes.\r\n\r\nFor comments on W. H. Havergal see Hymn 153.\r\n\r\n\r\n206. How blest are they whose hearts are pure          _W. H. Bathurst_,\r\n                                                               1796-1877\r\n\r\nBased on the beatitude in Matt. 5:8: “Blessed are the pure in heart: for\r\nthey shall see God.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, W. H. Bathurst, see Hymn 153.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GLENLUCE is one of the Common Tunes (See 20) in the _Scottish\r\nPsalter_ of 1635.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the _Scottish Psalter_ see Hymn 575.\r\n\r\n\r\n207. I would be true                   _Howard Arnold Walter_, 1884-1918\r\n\r\nA popular hymn at young people’s summer conferences and other youth\r\ngatherings. The words have often been reprinted in trade journals and\r\nnewspapers and used on many a motto card. The ideals of youth—truth,\r\npurity, strength, bravery, friendship, generosity, humility, laughter,\r\nlove, and helpfulness, encompassed in these few lines—were all revealed\r\nin the author’s brief life.\r\n\r\nHoward Arnold Walter was graduated _cum laude_ in 1905 from Princeton\r\nUniversity while Woodrow Wilson was president of the institution. He\r\nthen entered Hartford Theological Seminary to prepare himself for the\r\nministry, but after the first year went to Japan to teach English in\r\nWaseda University in Tokyo. After one year, he returned to Hartford\r\nwhere, upon graduation, he won the Two-Year Fellowship. In 1909 and 1910\r\nhe studied in Edinburgh and in German Universities. He chose the foreign\r\nmission field for life service but, owing to a weak heart, was unable to\r\npass the required physical examination. In spite of his handicap, he\r\nvolunteered for Y.M.C.A. work and was assigned by John R. Mott to India,\r\nwhere he worked among the Mohammedan students in Foreman Christian\r\nCollege, Lahore. He died there November 1, 1918, during the influenza\r\nepidemic, leaving a devoted wife and three small children. The words, “I\r\nwould be true,” were inscribed on a memorial tablet erected in his home\r\nchurch in New Britain, Conn.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written in 1907 in Japan when Walter was just 23 years old.\r\nRecalling the joys and friendships of his home, the words came to him on\r\nNew Year’s morning as he was on his knees. He mailed the poem entitled,\r\n“My Creed,” to his mother who sent it to _Harper’s Magazine_ in order to\r\nshare with others the beauty of its message. It appeared in the May,\r\n1907, issue of that magazine and later found its way into a number of\r\nhymn books.\r\n\r\nThe third stanza, making the hymn more complete, was later written by\r\nthe author and sent to Rev. Theodore A. Green, minister of the First\r\nChurch of Christ, New Haven, Connecticut:\r\n\r\n  I would be prayerful through each busy moment;\r\n  I would be constantly in touch with God;\r\n  I would be tuned to hear the slightest whisper;\r\n  I would have faith to keep the path Christ trod.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PEEK. No one seemed to know anything of the composer of this\r\ntune until very recently when Dr. Reginald L. McAll, secretary of the\r\nHymn Society of America, assigned to the Hon. Edgar M. Doughty,\r\nBrooklyn, an official referee of the New York State Supreme Court, an\r\naccomplished musician and active member of the Baptist Church, the task\r\nof searching out in behalf of the Society the facts concerning Mr. Peek.\r\nThe Hon. Mr. Doughty completed his research just before his death in\r\n1947, at the age of 80 and the information presented here is based on a\r\ndocument compiled from his papers by his secretary. Miss Mildred Taylor\r\nDenisch:\r\n\r\nJoseph Yates Peek, 1843-1911, born in Schenectady, N. Y., had very\r\nlittle formal musical training, but was endowed with a love for music\r\nand considerable native musical ability and became a proficient amateur\r\nperformer on the violin and piano. In early life he was a carpenter and\r\nfarmer but later established a business as florist and horticulturist. A\r\ndeeply religious man, always interested in the church, he retired from\r\nbusiness in 1904, and in spite of his advanced years, became a prominent\r\nlay preacher in the Methodist Church. In 1911 he was ordained, but his\r\ncareer as a regular minister was cut short when a heart attack, which\r\noccurred while preaching, resulted in his death. Peek was a humble\r\nChristian gentleman who sought no honors for himself, which may account\r\nfor the fact that his identity as the composer of this tune remained\r\nhidden so long. Then, too, he may have felt that the credit for the tune\r\ndid not belong entirely to himself, for he received considerable help\r\nfrom a friend, Dr. Tuller, an organist and composer, who jotted down the\r\nnotes as Peek whistled the melody, and later added the harmonization.\r\n\r\nPeek had received a copy of Walter’s poem which was printed on a New\r\nYear’s card and entitled, “My Creed.” He was greatly impressed with the\r\nwords, and in a moment of inspiration gave them wings of song to carry\r\nthem over the wide world.\r\n\r\nThe tune has become immensely popular in spite of its weak down-curve of\r\nmelody. The hymn may also be sung to Barnby’s more sturdy tune, “Perfect\r\nLove” (312), which fits the words perfectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n208. How happy is he born and taught           _Henry Wotton_, 1568-1639\r\n\r\nThe original of this hymn was published in _Reliquiae Wottonianae_ with\r\na memoir by Isaac Walton, 1651. The poem was altered somewhat to make it\r\nsuitable for a congregational hymn.\r\n\r\nHenry Wotton graduated from Oxford in 1588. He had a varied career,\r\ntravelling on the continent, acting as agent to the Earl of Essex for\r\ncollection of foreign intelligence, and then settling in Venice where he\r\nwas ambassador at the court from 1604-24, with two intervals during\r\nwhich he was engaged in diplomatic missions to other countries and in\r\nparliamentary work in England. From 1624 until his death he was provost\r\nof Eton. Besides the above-named book, he published _The Elements of\r\nArchitecture_, 1624, and _Ad Regem e Scotia reducem_ in 1633.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WAREHAM, by William Knapp, is from _A Sett of New Psalm Tunes\r\nand Anthems, in Four Parts by Wm. Knapp_, 1738, where it is set to Psalm\r\n36:5-10 with the heading, “For the Holy Sacrament.” It is a deservedly\r\npopular melody, remarkably smooth, moving throughout by step except the\r\nperfect fourth interval between the fifth and sixth notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n209. Walk in the light! so shalt thou know   _Bernard Barton_, 1784-1849\r\n\r\nA useful hymn, by a Quaker poet, setting forth the characteristic Quaker\r\ndoctrine of the “Inner Light,” based on I John 1:7: “But if we walk in\r\nthe light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another,\r\nand the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn appeared in the author’s _Devotional Verses_, London, 1826.\r\n\r\nBernard Barton, known in England as the “Quaker Poet” (as was Whittier\r\nin America), was born in London and educated at a Quaker school at\r\nIpswich. When 26 years old he became a Clerk in Alexander’s Bank at\r\nWoodbridge, Suffolk, and stayed there the remainder of his life. On Nov.\r\n16, 1843, he wrote in a letter:\r\n\r\n  I took my seat on the identical stool I now occupy at the desk to the\r\n  wood of which I have now well-nigh grown, in the third month of the\r\n  year 1810, and there I have sat for three and thirty years beside the\r\n  odd eight months without one month’s respite in all that time. I often\r\n  wonder that my health has stood this sedentary probation as it has and\r\n  that my mental facilities have survived three and thirty years of\r\n  putting down figures in three rows, casting them up and carrying them\r\n  forward, _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\nHe might have given some of these years to literary pursuits had he not\r\nfollowed the good advice of Charles Lamb who wrote him:\r\n\r\n  Throw yourself on the world, without any rational plan of support\r\n  beyond what the chance employ of booksellers would afford you! Throw\r\n  yourself rather, my dear sir, from the steep Tarpeian rock, slap-dash\r\n  headlong upon iron spikes. If you have but five consolatory minutes\r\n  between the desk and the bed, make much of them, and live a century in\r\n  them, rather than turn slave to the booksellers. They are Turks and\r\n  Tartars when they have poor authors at their beck. Hitherto you have\r\n  been at arm’s length from them—come not within their grasp. I have\r\n  known many authors’ want for bread—some repining, others enjoying the\r\n  blessed security of a counting-house—all agreeing they had rather have\r\n  been tailors, weavers, what not? rather than the things they were. I\r\n  have known some starved, some go mad, one dear friend literally dying\r\n  in a workhouse. Oh, you know not—may you never know—the miseries of\r\n  subsisting by authorship!\r\n\r\nHe published eight or ten volumes of verse. His writings show an\r\nextensive acquaintance with the Scriptures.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DEDHAM. For comments on the composer, William Gardiner, see\r\nHymn 197.\r\n\r\n\r\n210. Believe not those who say                    _Anne Brontë_, 1820-49\r\n\r\nA hymn of courage. The original is in 10 stanzas, of which this hymn is\r\na selection of stanzas 1, 2, 8, 9, 10.\r\n\r\nAnne Brontë, one of three illustrious sisters, the other two being\r\nCharlotte and Emily, was born near Bradford, England, the daughter of\r\nthe Rev. Patrick Brontë, Vicar of Haworth, Yorkshire. She was joint\r\nauthor with her sisters of a book of _Poems_, 1846, and wrote other\r\nvolumes under the pseudonym, “Acton Bell.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune, VIGIL, is by the Italian composer, Giovanni\r\nPaisiello, 1741-1816, whose works include 100 operas, a Passion\r\noratorio, 30 masses, a requiem, 40 motets, and 8 symphonies. From 1776\r\nto 1784, he was in the service of Empress Catherine of Russia, who a few\r\nyears later was receiving Mennonites from Danzig and West Prussia to\r\nsettle her crown lands at Chortitz. Paisiello was called to Paris to\r\norganize the music of the First Consul, meanwhile composing some church\r\nmusic. His last years were spent in Naples, where he was choirmaster to\r\nJoseph Bonaparte and Murat.\r\n\r\n\r\n211. Go forth to life                       _Samuel Longfellow_, 1819-92\r\n\r\nA challenge to live life bravely and true. The hymn is from _Hymns of\r\nthe Spirit_, 1864, prepared by Samuel Longfellow and Samuel Johnson. It\r\nis one of the lyrics which helped establish Longfellow’s reputation as a\r\nhymn writer.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Samuel Longfellow see Hymn 28.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MENDON is a variation of a “German Air” introduced into\r\nAmerican hymn books by Samuel Dyer. The original had an additional note\r\nin each line and a different last line. The change to the present form\r\nand its name is attributed to Lowell Mason.\r\n\r\nSamuel Dyer, 1785-1835, born in England, came to America when 26 years\r\nold and became a choir leader and teacher of sacred music in New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Baltimore. He published several collections of sacred\r\nmusic, one of which, _Philadelphia Collection of Sacred Music_, 1828,\r\ngives valuable sketches of composers, and information about Dyer\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CONSECRATION AND STEWARDSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\n212. O Jesus, I have promised                _John Ernest Bode_, 1816-74\r\n\r\nA hymn of consecration which the author wrote on the occasion of the\r\nconfirmation of his daughter and two sons as “O Jesus, _we_ have\r\npromised.” It is frequently, and appropriately, used at baptismal\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nJohn Ernest Bode graduated with high honors from Oxford, where he was a\r\nfellow and tutor for six years; then became rector of Westwall,\r\nOxfordshire, and later of Castle Campus, Cambridgeshire. He was a man of\r\nconsiderable attainments and was Bampton Lecturer in 1855. He wrote a\r\nnumber of hymns and is the author of several volumes of poetry.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ANGEL’S STORY, also known as “Supplication” and “Watermouth,”\r\nwas written for Emily H. Miller’s hymn, “I love to hear the story which\r\nangel voices tell,” from which it derives its name. It first appeared in\r\nthe _Methodist Sunday School Hymn Book_, 1881, but has since come into\r\nwide usage set to “O Jesus, I have promised.”\r\n\r\nThe composer, Arthur H. Mann, 1850-1930, was a distinguished English\r\norganist, and musical editor of _The Church of England Hymnal_. He was\r\nan authority on the music of Handel, and composed much church music.\r\nOxford University gave him the degrees of Bachelor of Music and Doctor\r\nof Music.\r\n\r\n\r\n213. We give Thee but thine own                     _W. W. How_, 1823-97\r\n\r\nBased on Prov. 19:17: “He that hath pity on the poor lendeth to the\r\nLord.” It is a hymn on Christian giving and liberality, sounding the\r\nreal humanitarian note, a side of religion which an effective and virile\r\nhymnology cannot ignore. It may appropriately be sung by choir or\r\ncongregation in the dedication of the offering. (See comments at 611.)\r\n\r\nFor comments on W. W. How see Hymn 144.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SCHUMANN, a fine short-meter tune, is ascribed to Robert\r\nSchumann but it seems as if no one has ever found anything among his\r\nmusical writings from which the tune could have been derived. It\r\nappeared in Lowell Mason’s _Cantica Laudis_ in 1850.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Schumann see Hymn 296.\r\n\r\n\r\n214. A charge to keep I have                   _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of Wesley’s short hymns taken from _Short Hymns on\r\nSelect Passages of the Holy Scriptures_, 1762, where it is headed, “Keep\r\nthe charge of the Lord, that ye die not” (Lev. 8:35).\r\n\r\nThe hymn strikes a much-needed note regarding the serious significance\r\nof this life. Thomas Carlyle expressed the same thought in his old age\r\nwhen he said: “The older I grow, and now I stand upon the brink of\r\neternity, the more comes back to me the sentence in the catechism which\r\nI learned when a child, and the fuller and deeper its meaning becomes:\r\n‘What is the chief end of man? To glorify God and enjoy Him forever.’”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BOYLSTON was composed by Lowell Mason and named after one of\r\nthe towns in his native state. It appeared in _The Choir_, 1832, set to\r\n“Our days are as the grass.” The tune is widely used with “Blest be the\r\ntie that binds.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Lowell Mason, see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n215. Take my life and let it be           _Frances R. Havergal_, 1836-79\r\n\r\nOne of the finest hymns of consecration and service. It has been\r\ntranslated into many languages, including Russian, and many of Africa\r\nand Asia.\r\n\r\nThe author’s own story of how this hymn was written after her visit in a\r\ncertain home throws a vivid light on her evangelical zeal:\r\n\r\n  There were ten persons in the house, some unconverted and long prayed\r\n  for, some converted but not rejoicing Christians. He gave me the\r\n  prayer, “Lord give me ALL in this house.” And He just did. Before I\r\n  left the house everyone had got a blessing. The night of my visit,\r\n  after I had retired, the governess asked me to go to the two\r\n  daughters. They were crying. Then and there both of them trusted and\r\n  rejoiced. I was too happy to sleep, and passed most of the night in\r\n  praise and renewal of my own consecration; and these little couplets\r\n  formed themselves and chimed in my heart one after the other, till\r\n  they finished with “Ever, ONLY, ALL for Thee!”\r\n\r\nThe hymn appears here unaltered from the original.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Frances Havergal see Hymn 126.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HENDON. This tune appeared first in America in _Carmina Sacra_,\r\n1841, edited by Lowell Mason. The composer, Henri Abraham César Malan,\r\n1787-1864, born in Geneva, Switzerland, was a man of many interests. He\r\nwas a well educated minister, a blacksmith, carpenter, printer, and\r\nartist. He had a burning zeal for the conversion of souls. Convinced\r\nthat the national church stood in need of reform, he aroused much\r\nopposition. After preaching an unorthodox sermon at the College of\r\nGeneva, he was dismissed from his regentship at the college and was\r\nfinally driven from the state church. He then built a chapel in his own\r\ngarden and preached there for 43 years, attracting overflowing crowds\r\nand becoming widely known throughout Belgium, France, England, and\r\nScotland for his evangelism. He wrote more than 1,000 hymns and set\r\ntunes to them, a remarkable achievement. As the originator of the modern\r\nhymn movement in the French Reformed Church, Malan has a permanent place\r\nin French Hymnody.\r\n\r\n\r\n216. My Jesus, I love Thee          _William Rolf Featherstone_, 1842-78\r\n\r\nThe authorship of this hymn was unknown until recently when Robert\r\nMcCutchan, author of _Our Hymnody_, discovered that it was written by\r\nWilliam Rolf Featherstone, a Canadian by birth, when he was only sixteen\r\nyears of age. The author sent the hymn to an aunt, Mrs. E. Featherstone\r\nWilson, living in Los Angeles, who suggested to her nephew that it be\r\npublished. No further information concerning Featherstone is at hand.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GORDON. The tune was written for this hymn which the composer,\r\nDr. Gordon, found in the _London Hymn Book_, 1864. This combination of\r\nhymn and tune became popular and is widely known in America.\r\n\r\nAdoniram Judson Gordon, 1836-1895, was born at New Hampton, New\r\nHampshire, educated at Brown University and Newton Theological Seminary,\r\nand became the distinguished pastor of the Clarendon Street Baptist\r\nChurch, Boston. He at one time was editor of _The Watchword_, and is\r\nauthor of a series of books called _Quiet Talks_.\r\n\r\n\r\n217. Have Thine own way, Lord              _Adelaide Pollard_, 1862-1934\r\n\r\nA hymn of the believer’s humble resignation to God, as the clay to the\r\npotter.\r\n\r\nThe author, Adelaide Addison Pollard, was a modest poet. She signed her\r\nwritings for many years with only her initials, but in recent times her\r\npublishers have used her full name. Miss Pollard was born in Iowa, but\r\ndied in New York City. She was buried in the family plot at Ft. Madison,\r\nIowa. While a teacher of elocution and expression, she became interested\r\nin deeper spiritual things through the ministry of R. A. Torrey and\r\nJames M. Gray, and enrolled for further Bible training at the Moody\r\nBible Institute, Chicago. She became a teacher in the Missionary\r\nAlliance Bible School at Nyack, N. Y., and also did missionary work in\r\nSouth Africa. Miss Pollard wrote numerous hymns and devotional poems.\r\nHer two best-known hymns are: “Have Thine own way, Lord,” and “Shepherd\r\nof Israel.” Her mother was Rebecca Pollard who wrote the song poem, “I\r\nsurrender all,” for which D. B. Towner wrote the music.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ADELAIDE. The name of the tune is obviously derived from the\r\nname of the author of the words for which it was composed. For comments\r\non the composer, Geo. C. Stebbins, see Hymn 38.\r\n\r\n\r\n218. Fountain of good, to own thy love       _Philip Doddridge_, 1702-51\r\n\r\nAn appealing hymn on fellowship and service as well as consecration.\r\n\r\nThe author entitled the hymn, “On Relieving Christ in the Poor.” The\r\noriginal first line began “Jesus, my Lord, how rich thy grace.” The hymn\r\nwas rewritten by Edward Osler, 1798-1863, for Hall’s _Mitre Hymn Book_,\r\n1836, in which form it is found in modern hymnals, including the\r\n_Hymnary_.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Philip Doddridge see Hymn 56.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DALEHURST was composed by Arthur Cottman, 1842-79, an\r\nEnglishman trained for the law but interested keenly in sacred music. It\r\nwas first published in Cottman’s _Ten Original Tunes_, 1874, and has\r\nsince been introduced into the hymnals and set to various texts. It is a\r\ntune of simple pattern, contemplative in mood, and should be sung in an\r\neven, moderate tempo.\r\n\r\n\r\n219. Master, speak! thy servant heareth   _Frances R. Havergal_, 1836-79\r\n\r\nBased on the conversation between Samuel and Eli, I Sam. 3:1-10.\r\n\r\nMiss Havergal’s favorite name for Christ was “Master,” because, she\r\nsaid, “it implies rule and submission, and this is what love craves. Men\r\nmay feel differently, but a true woman’s submission is inseparable from\r\ndeep love.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Frances Havergal see Hymn 126.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ AMEN, JESUS HAN SKAL RAADE (“Amen, Jesus, He shall reign”)\r\ncomes from Denmark. The composer, Anton Peter Berggreen, 1801-80, was\r\nborn in Copenhagen and lived there all his life. He studied music and\r\nbecame a composer of many works, the most popular being his _National\r\nSongs_ in eleven volumes. His collection of _Psalm Tunes_ are widely\r\nused in Danish churches. He was organist at Trinity Church, Copenhagen,\r\nand organized musical associations among laboring people which are still\r\npopular. For a number of years he was Professor of Singing at the\r\nMetropolitan School and inspector of the public schools in his native\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\r\n220. Savior, thy dying love                _Sylvanus D. Phelps_, 1816-95\r\n\r\nPhelps gave this hymn to be published in _Pure Gold,_ a Sunday school\r\nsongbook which Robert Lowry, composer of music, was then editing and of\r\nwhich more than a million copies were sold. The hymn was given the\r\nheading, “Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?” (Acts 9:6.)\r\n\r\nSylvanus Dryden Phelps, Baptist minister, was born in Suffolk, Conn.;\r\nreceived his education at Brown University; and in 1846 became pastor of\r\nthe First Baptist Church, New Haven, Conn., where he remained for 28\r\nyears. He published three volumes of poetry. His son, William Lyon\r\nPhelps, was the distinguished Professor of English Literature at Yale\r\nand a lay preacher.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SOMETHING FOR JESUS was written for this hymn. At the time he\r\ncomposed this tune, Lowry was pastor of a Baptist Church in Lewisburg,\r\nPa., and Professor of Literature in Bucknell University.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Robert Lowry see Hymn 187.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SERVICE AND BROTHERHOOD\r\n\r\n\r\n221. Work, for the night is coming      _Anna Louisa Coghill_, 1836-1907\r\n\r\nBased on John 9:4: “I must work the works of him that sent me, while it\r\nis day: the night cometh, when no man can work.” The hymn was written\r\nwhen the author, eighteen years old, lived in Canada. It was published\r\nin a Canadian newspaper and later in her small volume of poems, _Leaves\r\nfrom the Backwoods_, Montreal, 1864.\r\n\r\nAnna Louisa Walker was born in England but went in her teens with her\r\nparents to Sania, Canada, where her brothers were railway engineers.\r\nReturning to England, she became a governess for a time, then she\r\nreviewed books, making her home with her second cousin, a Mrs. Oliphant,\r\nfor some years. In 1883 she married Harry Coghill, a wealthy merchant.\r\nShe published six novels and a book of poems, _Oak and Maple_, and\r\nedited the _Autobiography and Letters_ of Mrs. Oliphant.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WORK SONG, known in England as “Diligence,” was written for\r\nthis hymn. To fit the tune it became necessary to drop a syllable in the\r\nfourth line of each verse, an alteration which the author disliked\r\nextremely and which she never sanctioned.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Lowell Mason see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n222. Where cross the crowded ways of life           _Frank Mason North_,\r\n                                                               1850-1935\r\n\r\nAn unexcelled “Hymn for the City.” The following account of it is given\r\nin _The Churchman_, July, 1938, in an article by Eloise R. Griffith, on\r\n“Our Great Hymns”:\r\n\r\n  Frank Mason North, D.D., a well-known clergyman of the Methodist\r\n  Church, is the author of this well-loved hymn. It is sometimes called\r\n  “A Prayer for the City,” or “A Prayer for the Multitudes,” and has the\r\n  distinction of appearing in more standard hymnals today than any other\r\n  hymn written in this century. To those of us who are concerned about\r\n  “how the other half lives,” and who know either from our own\r\n  experiences or those of friends about the darker side of life in a\r\n  great city and particularly in our own country during the last nine\r\n  years,—this beautiful hymn never fails to find a heartfelt response.\r\n  It paints a picture with which many city dwellers are all too\r\n  familiar.\r\n\r\n  In 1903, Dr. North was editor of _The Christian City_, the organ of\r\n  the Methodist City Missionary Society. His office was in the Fifth\r\n  Avenue building of the Methodist Book Concern. One day one of the\r\n  professors of Wesleyan University (who was on the committee to prepare\r\n  and revise the new Methodist hymnal, and who knew North’s ability to\r\n  write hymns), met him in one of the halls. “Why don’t you write a\r\n  missionary hymn for us, Dr. North?” asked the professor. “We need more\r\n  missionary hymns in our new hymnal.” Dr. North modestly answered that\r\n  he did not feel he would be able to write a hymn worthy of the\r\n  proposed new hymnal, but that he would try.\r\n\r\n  Soon after this incident occurred, Dr. North was preaching a sermon\r\n  from the text in St. Matthew 22:9: “Go ye therefore into the\r\n  highways,” etc. During his preparation for this sermon, he was again\r\n  especially impressed by the rendering of the Greek text in the Revised\r\n  Version, which reads “Go ye therefore into the partings of the\r\n  highways.” Dr. North thought of and described in his sermon the\r\n  appealing challenge made by great crowds of people thronging the\r\n  crossroads of the city—places like Madison Square and Union Square in\r\n  the New York of 1903. Dr. North knew New York City very thoroughly,\r\n  and his heart yearned over the sick, the lonely, the destitute, the\r\n  troubled. So, while he preached, the first line of this great hymn\r\n  came to him—“Where cross the crowded ways of life.” It did not take\r\n  him long to compose the words which followed, and after the\r\n  publication of the hymn in _The Christian City_, it was at once\r\n  accepted for the new Methodist hymnal of 1905. The hymn is widely used\r\n  in Canada and throughout Great Britain, and has been translated into\r\n  several foreign languages, including some of the Far East ones.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GERMANY is a fine long-meter tune found in a book, _Sacred\r\nMelodies_, in which the compiler, William Gardiner, 1770-1853, an\r\nEnglish stocking manufacturer interested in music, collected\r\ncompositions by the best foreign composers, adapting them to English\r\nwords. The tune is also known by the name “Walton,” especially in\r\nEngland. As to its origin, Gardiner says in his book, _Music and\r\nFriends_, that it “is somewhere in the works of Beethoven, but where I\r\ncannot now point out.” This may be a mistake, for no one else has ever\r\nfound it in a Beethoven collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n223. O Master, let me walk with Thee     _Washington Gladden_, 1836-1918\r\n\r\nA greatly loved service hymn which the author entitled, “Walking with\r\nGod.” In a note dated June 15, 1907, Gladden says:\r\n\r\n  This hymn was written in 1879 for a magazine, _Sunday Afternoon_,\r\n  which I was then editing. There were three eight-line stanzas. Dr.\r\n  Charles H. Richards found the poem, which was not intended for a hymn,\r\n  and made a hymn of it by omitting the second stanza, which was not\r\n  suitable for devotional purposes.\r\n\r\nThe omitted stanza reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  O Master, let me walk with Thee\r\n  Before the taunting Pharisee;\r\n  Help me to bear the sting of spite,\r\n  The hate of men who hide thy light,\r\n  The sore distrust of souls sincere\r\n  Who cannot read thy judgments clear,\r\n  The dullness of the multitude\r\n  Who dimly guess that thou art good.\r\n\r\nWashington Gladden, distinguished Congregational minister and author,\r\nwas reared on a farm near Oswego, N. Y., attending country school and\r\nOswego Academy and later entering Williams College, from which he\r\ngraduated in 1859. He was licensed to preach in 1860; then held\r\npastorates in Congregational churches in New York and Massachusetts, and\r\nfinally in 1882 began his widely known and influential work as pastor of\r\nthe First Congregational Church in Columbus, Ohio, which was to last for\r\n28 years. His lectures and writings on social questions were prophetic\r\nmessages of the time. After 50 years in the ministry, he wrote: “If the\r\nchurch would dare to preach and practice the things which Jesus Christ\r\nhas commanded, she would soon regain her lost power.” He is the author\r\nof thirty or more volumes but is remembered best by this poem which has\r\ncome into such wide use in the worship services of all the churches.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MARYTON was written for the words, “Sun of my soul, Thou Savior\r\ndear,” in _Church Hymns and Tunes_, 1874; but it has become inseparably\r\nassociated with Gladden’s hymn. Permission to use this hymn was granted\r\nby the author only on condition that it be used with this tune.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Henry Percy Smith, 1825-98, was a minister in the Church\r\nof England, deeply interested in church music. After graduating from\r\nBalliol College, Oxford, he served various churches as curate and vicar\r\nand finally became chaplain at Cannes and Canon of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n\r\n224. O Thou great Friend to all the sons of men       _Theodore Parker_,\r\n                                                                 1810-60\r\n\r\nBased on the Scriptural passages, John 15:14: “Ye are my friends if ye\r\ndo the things which I command you” and John 14:6: “I am the way, the\r\ntruth, and the life.”\r\n\r\nThe author, Rev. Theodore Parker, an outstanding abolitionist and a\r\nleader in New England Unitarianism, was educated at Harvard and spent\r\nmost of his ministry in Boston. While travelling abroad in the hope of\r\nrestoring his health, he became ill and died at Florence, Italy, where\r\nhe was buried.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FFIGYSBREN. For comments on this tune see Hymn 183.\r\n\r\n\r\n225. Onward, Christian soldiers             _S. Baring-Gould_, 1834-1924\r\n\r\nA hymn of the Christian warfare, written by a Church of England\r\nclergyman for a children’s processional, but now having a much wider\r\nuse. The author gave the following account of the writing of the hymn:\r\n\r\n  Whitmonday is a great day for school festivals in Yorkshire. One\r\n  Whitmonday, thirty years ago, it was arranged that our school should\r\n  join forces with a neighboring village. I wanted the children to sing\r\n  when marching from one village to another; so I sat up at night,\r\n  resolved that I would write something myself. “Onward, Christian\r\n  soldiers” was the result. It was written in great haste, and I am\r\n  afraid some of the rhymes are faulty. Certainly nothing has surprised\r\n  me more than its popularity.\r\n\r\nAn omitted stanza reads:\r\n\r\n  What the saints established,\r\n    That I hold for true;\r\n  What the saints believed,\r\n    That believe I too.\r\n  Long as earth endureth\r\n    Men that faith will hold,\r\n  Kingdoms, nations, empires\r\n    In destruction rolled.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, S. Baring-Gould, see Hymn 29.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. GERTRUDE was written for these words by Sir Arthur Sullivan\r\nand dedicated to Mrs. Gertrude Clay-Ker-Seymer, in whose house the\r\ncomposer often stayed. The hymn derived a great part of its popularity\r\nfrom its use with this stirring tune.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Sullivan see Hymn 113.\r\n\r\n\r\n226. Teach me, my God and King               _George Herbert_, 1593-1633\r\n                                                _Adapted by John Wesley_\r\n\r\nA hymn of consecration and heavenly-mindedness that marks the Christian\r\nlife. Verses 2 and 4 are by John Wesley, and the third verse was altered\r\nby him. For comments on John Wesley see Hymn 170.\r\n\r\nGeorge Herbert, noted English poet and minister in the Church of\r\nEngland, was born in Wales; educated at Cambridge; and became a great\r\npastor and preacher, serving, during his all too brief career, churches\r\nat Layton Ecclesia in 1626, and at Bemerton from 1630 to his death in\r\n1632. His spare moments were given to the cultivation of sacred music.\r\nHis principal work is _The Temple_, a book of poems. His popularity was\r\ngreatly increased through the publication of his _Life_, written by\r\nIsaak Walton.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MORNINGTON is an arrangement of a chant written about 1760 by\r\nthe Earl of Mornington, whose name was Garret Wellesley (or Wesley),\r\n1735-81. He was the father of the Duke of Wellington. The name was\r\nchanged from Wesley to Wellesley about 1790. A composer of much secular\r\nand sacred music, he lived most of his life in Dublin, and was the first\r\nProfessor of Music at Dublin University.\r\n\r\n\r\n227. When thy heart with joy o’erflowing          _Theodore C. Williams_\r\n\r\nA hymn setting forth the spirit of brotherhood in terms of sharing.\r\nInformation regarding the author, Rev. Theodore C. Williams, has not\r\nbeen traced.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BULLINGER was written in 1874 by Ethelbert William Bullinger,\r\n1837-1913, an English clergyman who made the study of music his\r\navocation. He is remembered principally as the composer of this tune\r\nwith its last phrase somewhat awkward due to the long, tied initial\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n\r\n228. Who is thy neighbor?                      _William Cutter_, 1801-87\r\n\r\nBased on the parable of the Good Samaritan. The hymn first appeared in\r\n_The Christian Mirror_, Portland, Me., 1838, in seven stanzas. One of\r\nthe omitted stanzas reads:\r\n\r\n  Thy neighbor? Yonder toiling slave,\r\n    Fettered in thought and limb;\r\n  Whose hopes are all beyond the grave,\r\n    Go thou, and ransom him.\r\n\r\nThe author, William Cutter, was an editor and publisher, born at\r\nYarmouth, Me., a graduate of Bowdoin College, and member of the\r\nCongregational Church. He was in business in Portland, Me., for several\r\nyears and then in Brooklyn, N. Y. He has been described as “a deserving\r\nwriter who has hitherto missed his due meed of acknowledgement.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BURFORD, a very good tune in triple time, written in the minor\r\nmode, is of uncertain authorship, though it is credited in some books to\r\nHenry Purcell, _c._ 1658-95, one of England’s great composers and\r\norganists. It is set to Psalm 42 in _A Book of Psalmody_, 1718, by John\r\nChetham, and appears in a large number of other 18th century psalmodies,\r\ninvariably without composer’s name.\r\n\r\n\r\n229. O brother man, fold to thy heart thy brother        _John Greenleaf\r\n                                                      Whittier_, 1807-92\r\n\r\nA hymn of brotherly love and service, taken from a poem of 15 stanzas,\r\nentitled, “Worship,” to which was affixed the scriptural reference,\r\nJames 1:27: “Pure religion and undefiled before God the Father is this,\r\nTo visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep\r\nhimself unspotted from the world.” A concern for the well being of his\r\nfellow man was to Whittier a vital part of the Christian faith, as\r\nwitness his championship of the cause of the slaves.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Greenleaf Whittier see Hymn 173.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ COMFORT. The tune appears anonymously in the “Supplement” to\r\n_Hymns of the Spirit_, 1937.\r\n\r\n\r\n230. Rise up, O men of God                   _William P. Merrill_, 1867—\r\n\r\nA hymn challenging the _men_ of the church to loyal service to Christ.\r\nIt is widely used in America and has found a place in English and\r\nCanadian hymnals. Concerning the origin of the hymn, Dr. Merrill says,\r\nin a letter to the writer, dated, April 18, 1947:\r\n\r\n  I was asked back in 1911 to write a hymn to be used in the\r\n  “Brotherhood Movement,” then going strong. I had come upon an article\r\n  by Gerald Stanley Lee, entitled, “The Church of the Strong Men”; and\r\n  that gave me a start. I can give no interesting details as to how I\r\n  wrote it; I just did it.\r\n\r\n  Highchurchmen have objected to the hymn, because they have said that\r\n  only God can make the church great. To that I have answered that if\r\n  anyone can show me a single instance in history where God has made the\r\n  church great without using MEN OF GOD to do it, I should be\r\n  interested. No answer has ever come. I heard that hymn sung in Europe,\r\n  in India, China, and Japan.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, William P. Merrill, see Hymn 183.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LEIGHTON was composed by Henry Wellington Greatorex, 1811-58,\r\nan Englishman by birth. Coming to the United States in 1839, he served\r\nas organist at Central Congregational Church, Hartford, Conn., in St.\r\nPaul’s and Calvary Churches, New York City, and finally in an Episcopal\r\nChurch at Charleston, S. C. He edited the _Greatorex Collection_ of 1856\r\nand did much to improve the standards of music used in the worship\r\nservice. He composed a widely used setting for the “Gloria Patri” (606).\r\nDr. Merrill’s hymn has been set to various tunes, the one generally used\r\nand preferred by the author being “Festal Song,” by William H. Walter.\r\n\r\n\r\n231. Go, labor on; spend and be spent          _Horatius Bonar_, 1809-89\r\n\r\nA hymn to encourage Christian workers. It was published in _Songs for\r\nthe Wilderness_, 1843, under the title, “Labour for Christ.” In _Hymns\r\nof Faith and Hope_, 1867, it was entitled, “The Useful Life.”\r\n\r\nRegarding the origin of the hymn, Rev. H. N. Bonar, son of the author\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n  It was probably in the year 1836 that my father first wrote a hymn not\r\n  primarily intended for the young. To encourage his faithful fellow\r\n  workers in his mission district, he wrote, to the tune of the “Old\r\n  Hundredth,” the now-familiar hymn, “Go, labour on.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Horatius Bonar see Hymn 129.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ERNAN was written for _Cantica Laudis_, 1850, one of the books\r\nwhich Mason published with the assistance of Geo. J. Webb. For comments\r\non the composer, Lowell Mason, see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE INNER LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n232. O have you not heard of that beautiful stream      _R. Torrey, Jr._\r\n\r\nBased on Rev. 22:1, 17: “And he showed me a pure river of water of life,\r\nclear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.”\r\n\r\n“And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say,\r\nCome. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take\r\nthe water of life freely.”\r\n\r\nIt is reminiscent also of Ezek. 47:1-12, the vision of the healing\r\nstream of water flowing from the house of God to the Dead Sea, causing\r\nnew life to flourish. “Everything shall live whither the river cometh.”\r\n(v. 9).\r\n\r\nAn omitted stanza reads:\r\n\r\n  With murmuring sound doth it wander along\r\n    Through fields of eternal green;\r\n  Where songs of the blest, in their haven of rest\r\n    Float soft on the air serene.\r\n\r\nThe poem, with the present music, appeared in Asa Hull’s, _The Casket_,\r\npublished in Philadelphia, 1865, where it is credited to R. Torrey, Jr.\r\nTo date, no information has come to light concerning the author. He\r\nlived a generation earlier than the well known preacher and teacher, R.\r\nA. Torrey. In 1868, the hymn was published, anonymously, in _Spiritual\r\nHarp_, Boston, a book of songs for congregational use dedicated by the\r\nauthors to “the Spiritualists and Reformers of the world, love of truth\r\nand progress.” Two years later, in 1870, the words and music appeared in\r\nEngland, in the _Sunday School Hymnary_, published by the National\r\nSunday School Union in London.\r\n\r\nThe German version is a free translation made by Ernst Heinrich\r\nGebhardt, 1832-99, a Methodist minister and evangelist, known in\r\nGermany, the place of his birth, as the father of German revivalistic\r\nand holiness songs. It is superior, in poetic quality and evangelistic\r\nappeal, to the English original.\r\n\r\nGebhardt was born in Ludwigsburg, Württemberg, July 12, 1832. He\r\nprepared to be an apothecary but later decided to go to Chile, South\r\nAmerica, to live with relatives. After spending five years on a farm in\r\nChile, he returned to Germany to visit his mother. A shipwreck on the\r\nreturn voyage resulted in a deep spiritual awakening. Arriving in\r\nLudwigsburg, he accompanied his mother to the Sylvester service on New\r\nYear’s night, 1859, in the Methodist Church, where he dedicated his life\r\nto Christian work. Having decided to become an evangelist, he attended\r\nthe school for ministers in the Methodist Church at Bremen where his\r\nzeal and musical gifts were quickly recognized. He was appointed\r\n_Reiseprediger_ and in this capacity served in Ludwigsburg (1860-62),\r\nHeilbronn (1862-66), Pforzheim (1866-68), Bremen (1868-71), Ludwigsburg\r\n(1871-74), Zurich (1874-77), Strassburg i. E. (1877-81), Biel, Kt. Bern\r\n(1880-84), Zwickau (1884-88) and finally in Karlsruhe (1888-99).\r\nGebhardt was married and had a family of nine children.\r\n\r\nHis activities included a trip to the United States, 1881-83, during\r\nwhich he travelled through 30 States. In Brighton, England, he took part\r\nin holiness meetings held there, and later travelled with R. Pearsall\r\nSmith, of Philadelphia, through Germany and Switzerland, serving as song\r\nleader in the evangelistic meetings conducted by Smith.\r\n\r\nGebhardt is the author of many original hymns and made over 50\r\ntranslations from the English, most of them from the Moody and Sankey\r\nsongs. He compiled numerous song books where his works appeared. “Ich\r\nweiss einen Strom” was published in his _Frohe Botschaft_, 1875, a\r\npopular book of gospel songs drawn mostly from English sources, both\r\nwords and music. The third stanza, omitted here, reads:\r\n\r\n  Der Strom ist gar tief und sein Wasser ist klar,\r\n  Es schmecket so lieblich und fein;\r\n  Es heilet die Kranken und stärkt wunderbar,\r\n  Ja, machet die Unreinsten rein!\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ICH WEISS EINEN STROM, originally entitled, “Beautiful Stream,”\r\nand written in 6/8 time, first appeared in _Casket of Sunday School\r\nMelodies_, 1865, published by the composer, Asa Hull, in Philadelphia.\r\nThe tune is wedded inseparably to Torrey’s words. It is very popular\r\namong General Conference of Mennonites churches where it is usually sung\r\nin the slow tempo and dignity of a chorale. Neither the words nor the\r\nmusic, with its refrain, have the characteristics of a chorale. It is a\r\nuseful song, especially for evangelistic services.\r\n\r\nAsa Hull was born January 18, 1828, in Keene, N. Y. He studied harmony\r\nand composition with B. F. Baker and Geo. J. Webb in Boston, and at the\r\nage of 20 became organist and choirmaster at Watertown, Mass. He\r\ncomposed many church tunes. Hull, a pioneer publisher of Sunday school\r\nand gospel song books, was also known as a shrewd business man. His\r\npublications numbered 30 books and about 100 pamphlets. _Gem of Gems_,\r\npublished in 1881, sold over 300,000 copies.

O holy Savior, Friend unseen         _Charlotte Elliott_, 1789-1871\r\n\r\nA hymn which is best understood by those who have had experience in\r\nsuffering and sorrow. Entitled, “Clinging to Christ,” it was written in\r\n1834, shortly after the death of the author’s father and published in\r\nthe 1834 edition of her _Invalid’s Hymn Book_.\r\n\r\nCharlotte Elliott, a member of the Church of England, was born and\r\nreared amid refined, cultured, Christian surroundings. Her grandfather,\r\nRev. Henry Venn, was an “eminent Church of England divine of apostolic\r\ncharacter and labors,” and the author of _The Whole Duty of Man_.\r\nCharlotte was a woman of keen intellect and was gifted in music and art.\r\nUnfortunately, she became an invalid at 32 and remained so till the end\r\nof her long life, oftentimes enduring great suffering. This may account\r\nfor the note of tenderness found in all her hymns. In spite of her\r\ninvalidism, she did a large amount of literary work, publishing four or\r\nfive volumes of poetry. She was a modest woman, publishing all her books\r\nanonymously. A large number of her 150 hymns are still in use, the most\r\npopular being “Just as I am, without one plea” (458).\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ INTEGER VITAE (FLEMMING).

Thou true Vine, that heals the nations                     _T.S.N._\r\n\r\nBased on John 15:1-5: “I am the true vine, and my Father is the\r\nhusbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away:\r\nand every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring\r\nforth more fruit. Now are ye clean through the work which I have spoken\r\nunto you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of\r\nitself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in\r\nme. I am the vine, ye are the branches; He that abideth in me and I in\r\nhim, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn was composed for _Songs of Praise_, 1933, London. The author is\r\nnot identified except by the initials T.S.N.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PLEADING SAVIOUR, a folk-song type of tune, is from the\r\n_Plymouth Collection of Hymns and Tunes_, New York, 1855, which Henry\r\nWard Beecher compiled for use in the Plymouth Congregational Church,\r\nBrooklyn, of which he was pastor. The musical editors were John Zundel\r\n(178) and the Rev. Charles Beecher.\r\n\r\n\r\n235. God of my heart                                         _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nA hymn celebrating the believer’s life in God. It was taken from _St.\r\nBasil’s Hymnal_ compiled by the Basilian Fathers, published in 1918. The\r\nmusical editors were Healey Willan and Jules Brazil. The authorship of\r\nthe hymn is anonymous.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CARMEN NATURAE is an arrangement from a melody in Donizetti’s\r\nopera, _Carmen_.\r\n\r\nGaetano Donizetti, 1797-1848, son of an Italian weaver, studied music in\r\nNaples. He composed 66 operas, 6 masses, 12 string quartets, a requiem,\r\nsongs, and other compositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n236. Since Jesus is my Friend                   _Paul Gerhardt_, 1607-76\r\n                                   _Tr. by Catherine Winkworth_, 1829-78\r\n\r\nA hymn of consolation and joy to give strength and courage to troubled\r\nhearts. It is based on Romans 8:31: “If God be for us, who can be\r\nagainst us?” The original has 15 stanzas. The lines translated here are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  Hab ich das Haupt zum Freunde\r\n    Und bin geliebt bei Gott,\r\n  Was kann mir tun der Feinde\r\n    Und Widersacher Rott’?\r\n\r\n  Sein Geist spricht meinem Geiste\r\n    Manch süsses Trostwort zu,\r\n  Wie Gott dem Hülfe leiste\r\n    Der bei ihm suchet Ruh.\r\n\r\n  Mein Herze geht in Sprüngen\r\n    Und kann nicht traurig sein,\r\n  Ist voller Freud’ und Singen,\r\n    Sieht lauter Sonnenschein.\r\n\r\n  Die Sonne, die mir lachet\r\n    Ist mein Herr Jesus Christ,\r\n  Das, was mich singen machet,\r\n    Ist, was im Himmel ist.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Paul Gerhardt, see Hymn 134.\r\n\r\nThe translation by Miss Winkworth appeared in her _Lyra Germanica_,\r\nfirst series, 1855.\r\n\r\nCatherine Winkworth, an English poet, was the foremost translator of\r\nGerman chorales. She made a special study of the German hymns and hymn\r\nwriters and is the author of _Lyra Germanica_, 1st. ser., 1855; 2d.\r\nser., 1858; _The Chorale Book for England_, 1863; and _Christian Singers\r\nof Germany_, 1869. Twenty-five of her works are found in the _Hymnary_.\r\nShe was a member of the Church of England.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GREENWOOD was composed for the hymn beginning, “We lift our\r\nhearts to Thee,” in a _Collection of Church Music_, 1849, by Root and\r\nSweetser.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Joseph Emerson Sweetser, 1825-73, was an English organist\r\nand composer of vocal music. A part of his life was spent in New York\r\nCity as organist at the Church of the Puritans.\r\n\r\n\r\n237. O heart of God!                                      _F. Stanfield_\r\n\r\nA hymn of confidence and trust resulting from the mystical repose in the\r\nheart of God.\r\n\r\nThe words and tune are found in _St. Basil’s Hymnal_, compiled by the\r\nBasilican Fathers, and published in Chicago, 1918.\r\n\r\nThe author, Francis Stanfield, a Roman Catholic priest, was born in\r\nLondon, November 5, 1836, the son of Clarkson Stanfield, an artist. He\r\nwas educated at St. Edmund’s College, near Ware. After ordination, he\r\nspent most of his time conducting missions and retreats, though he was\r\nstationed for brief periods in several parishes. He is the author of\r\nnumerous hymns which were collected and published by the Benedictine\r\nFathers, at Ramsgate, England. The present hymn is an adaptation, made\r\nby the editors of the _Hymnary_, of his “O Sacred Heart, our home lies\r\ndeep in Thee.” The original is too Catholic for Protestant use.\r\n\r\nNo information is at hand concerning the composer of the tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n238. Life of all that lives below              _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n                                            _Samuel Longfellow_, 1819-92\r\n\r\nThis hymn, a prayer for a fuller life nurtured by Christ, the living\r\nBread, is of composite authorship, but no information is at hand\r\nconcerning the part which Wesley and Longfellow, respectively, had in\r\nit. It is not listed in Julian’s _Dictionary of Hymnology_.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Longfellow see Hymn 28.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PLEYEL is taken from the _Andante_ movement of the composer’s\r\n_Fourth String Quartet, Op. 7_. It appeared as a long-meter tune in\r\n_Arnold and Callcott’s Psalms_, 1791, set to Addison’s hymn, “The\r\nspacious firmament on high.”\r\n\r\nIgnace Josef Pleyel, 1757-1831, 24th child of an Austrian schoolmaster,\r\nwas a favorite pupil of Haydn and gained fame as a composer and\r\nconductor. Mozart spoke highly of his quartets. Later in life he engaged\r\nin business, publishing and selling music, and manufacturing pianos of\r\nhigh quality. The manufacturing house of Pleyel and Company is still\r\nwell and favorably known in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n239. There is a place of quiet rest       _Cleland B. McAfee_, 1866-1944\r\n\r\nThe heart of the message of this popular devotional hymn, according to a\r\nstatement made by the author to the present writer, is in the second\r\nstanza, “There is a place of comfort sweet, near to the heart of God.”\r\nCleland B. McAfee was a distinguished preacher, author, and teacher in\r\nthe Presbyterian Church. He was accustomed to write an original hymn for\r\nthe communion service in his church. It was in 1901, during his\r\npastorate in Chicago, that a great sorrow came into his life occasioned\r\nby the death of his nephew. The communion was to be held the following\r\nSunday and the members of the congregation came to the church tense with\r\nspeculation about the service and the kind of hymn their pastor had\r\ncomposed for the day. These simple words and tune were offered them and\r\nseemed to fit the occasion perfectly. Since then the hymn has been\r\ntranslated into many languages and gone all over the world. It was not\r\nincluded in the new _Presbyterian Hymnal_, 1933, because the words and\r\nmusic were considered to be more of the nature of a gospel song than a\r\nhymn.\r\n\r\nCleland M. McAfee received his education at Park College and Union\r\nTheological Seminary, New York. From 1888 to 1901, he was pastor and\r\nprofessor at Park College; pastor of the First Presbyterian Church,\r\nChicago, 1901-04; and of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church,\r\nBrooklyn, 1904-12. He later was connected with McCormick Theological\r\nSeminary in Chicago, first as Professor of Systematic Theology and then\r\nas president of the institution. He is the author of several books on\r\nreligious subjects, and also wrote extensively on foreign missions, a\r\nsubject in which he had a keen interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          COURAGE AND COMFORT\r\n\r\n\r\n240. Come unto Me, ye weary                    _William C. Dix_, 1837-98\r\n\r\nBased on some of the precious promises of Christ, especially Matt.\r\n11:28: “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden and I will\r\ngive you rest.” It may be compared with Bonar’s hymn, “I heard the voice\r\nof Jesus say” (142) on the same text.\r\n\r\nThe author gives the story of the hymn as follows:\r\n\r\n  I was ill and depressed at the time, and it was almost to idle away\r\n  the hours that I wrote the hymn. I had been ill for many weeks, and\r\n  felt weary and faint, and the hymn really expresses the languidness of\r\n  body from which I was suffering at the time. Soon after its\r\n  composition I recovered, and I always look back to that hymn as the\r\n  turning point in my illness.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, William Chatterdon Dix, see Hymn 78.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ICH WEISS AN WEN ICH GLAUBE is taken from the _Gesangbuch mit\r\nNoten_ (206) where it is used with a hymn by Ernst Moritz Arndt,\r\nbeginning with these words.\r\n\r\n\r\n241. When in the madd’ning maze of things     _John Greenleaf Whittier_,\r\n                                                                 1807-92\r\n\r\nPreëminently an experienced person’s meditation on trust in God. The\r\nhymn is taken from a poem of 22 stanzas entitled, “The Eternal\r\nGoodness,” written apparently without any thought of their being sung.\r\nIn the first line the editors substituted the initial word “when” for\r\nthe original “yet.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Greenleaf Whittier see Hymn 173.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ES IST EIN BORN. For comments on this tune see Hymn 99.\r\n\r\n\r\n242. Thy way is in the deep, O Lord         _James Martineau_, 1805-1900\r\n\r\nBased on Psalm 77:19: “Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great\r\nwaters.”\r\n\r\nJames Martineau, English Unitarian, was a man of letters, a philosopher,\r\na theologian, and the most eloquent and distinguished preacher of his\r\nchurch in his time. He served churches in Liverpool and London and was\r\nProfessor of Mental and Moral Philosophy in Manchester New College. He\r\nedited _Hymns for the Christian Church and Home_, 1840, a book widely\r\nused among Unitarians in England.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GRÄFENBERG, sung somewhat slowly, is a tune of fine stateliness\r\nand dignity. It is from the 5th edition of Crüger’s _Praxis Pietatis\r\nMelica_, Berlin, 1653. It is also known as “_Nun Danket All_.”\r\n\r\nJohann Crüger, 1598-1662, one of the most distinguished musicians of his\r\ntime, was born near Brandenburg. He received a thorough musical training\r\nunder Paulus Homberger in Regensburg and in 1622 he was appointed cantor\r\nof the St. Nicholas Lutheran Church, in Berlin, and one of the masters\r\nof the Greyfriars Gymnasium. He founded the noted choir of St. Nicholas\r\nChurch. Crüger was a tune-writer of the first rank and composed some of\r\nthe most famous and favorite chorales. He published various collections\r\nof hymns, among them the celebrated _Praxis Pietas Melica_, 1644, which\r\npassed through more than fifty editions. He died in Berlin, February 23,\r\n1662.\r\n\r\n\r\n243. Come, ye disconsolate                     _Thomas Moore_, 1779-1852\r\n                                                 _Thomas Hastings_, v. 3\r\n\r\nA hymn of consolation by an author whose life was far from exemplary. It\r\nmay be the hymn should on this account have been omitted; but something\r\nin his heart enabled the author, through his lyrics, to touch the heart\r\nof humanity, and his songs have been widely used and admired in spite of\r\nthe strange chapters and romantic incidents in his life.\r\n\r\nThomas Moore, Irish poet, was born in Dublin, studied at Trinity\r\nCollege, and then moved to London and began the study of law. He held a\r\ngovernment position in Bermuda for some time and during his life\r\npublished many volumes of prose and poetry. He will always be remembered\r\nby his songs, “Believe me if all those endearing young charms,” “The\r\nlast rose of summer,” and “Oft in the stilly night.”\r\n\r\nThe third stanza is by Thomas Hastings, coeditor with Lowell Mason of\r\n_Spiritual Songs for Social Worship_, in which the hymn first appeared.\r\nMoore’s third stanza, omitted in all hymn books, reads:\r\n\r\n  Go ask the infidel what boon he brings us,\r\n    What charm for aching hearts he can reveal,\r\n  Sweet as that heavenly promise Hope sings us—\r\n    Earth has no sorrow that God cannot heal.\r\n\r\nIt is a good stanza, but, then, good hymns do not argue.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Thomas Hastings see Hymn 120.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CONSOLATOR, also known as “Consolation,” “Webbe,” “Alma” or\r\n“Alma Redemptor,” is an adaptation of a tune by Samuel Webbe.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Samuel Webbe see Hymn 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n244. I look to Thee in every need           _Samuel Longfellow_, 1819-92\r\n\r\nA hymn, much-needed, to express the effect of religious faith and trust\r\nupon mental and bodily health. The idea, so essential to the Gospel, has\r\nbeen too largely neglected in most Protestant Churches. The hymn is\r\nrepresentative of the fine literary and devotional quality of the\r\nauthor’s poetry. Though an American hymn, it was introduced into the\r\nchurch’s worship in England before it was used in this country.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Samuel Longfellow see Hymn 28.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ O JESU appeared in _J. B. Reimanns Org. v. Hirschb. alter und\r\nneuer Melodien Evangel. Lieder_, etc., 1747, where it was set to the\r\nhymn, “_O Jesu, warum legst du mir_.” In the original, the first and\r\nlast notes of each line were half-notes. It is a tune “of a simple,\r\nfamiliar pattern but with a certain quiet dignity.”\r\n\r\nThe composer, Johann Balthaser Reimann, 1702-47, was a German cantor and\r\norganist in churches in Neustadt, Breslau, and Hirschberg, Schleswig.\r\n\r\n\r\n245. My God and Father, while I stray     _Charlotte Elliott_, 1789-1871\r\n\r\nA hymn written by one who had disciplined herself to accept with\r\npatience and resignation the bitter cross of ill health which was laid\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\nShe writes of her experience:\r\n\r\n  Oh, many struggles and apparently fruitless ones it has cost me to\r\n  become resigned to the appointments of my Heavenly Father. But the\r\n  struggle is now over. He knows, and he alone, what it is, day after\r\n  day, hour after hour, to fight against bodily feelings of almost\r\n  overpowering weakness, languor, and exhaustion; to resolve not to\r\n  yield to slothfulness, depression, and instability, such as the body\r\n  causes me to long to indulge, but to rise every morning determined to\r\n  take for my motto: “If any man will come after Me, let him deny\r\n  himself, take up his cross daily and follow Me.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn is based on Matt. 26:42: “O my Father, if this cup may not pass\r\naway from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.” It is a hymn of\r\nhumble resignation. Another hymn, setting forth the will of God as\r\ndemanding active co-operation, is found at No. 342. Some fine stanzas\r\nhave been omitted here:\r\n\r\n  Though Thou hast called me to resign\r\n  What most I prized, it ne’er was mine;\r\n  I have but yielded what was Thine—\r\n    “Thy will be done.”\r\n\r\n  Should grief or sickness waste away\r\n  My life in premature decay,\r\n  My Father, still I strive to say,\r\n    “Thy will be done.”\r\n\r\n  Let but my fainting heart be blest\r\n  With Thy sweet Spirit for its Guest;\r\n  My God, to Thee I leave the rest—\r\n    “Thy will be done.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charlotte Elliott see Hymn 233.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HANFORD was written for “Jesus, my Saviour, look on me,”\r\nanother of Miss Elliott’s hymns. The composer, who often stayed in the\r\nhome of Mrs. Gertrude Clay-Ker-Seymer at Hanford, in Dorsetshire, wrote\r\nthe tune there, hence its name.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Arthur Sullivan, see Hymn 113.\r\n\r\n\r\n246. Give to the winds thy fears                _Paul Gerhardt_, 1607-76\r\n                                           _Tr. by John Wesley_, 1703-91\r\n\r\nA hymn of comfort to the afflicted and courage to the dying. It is a\r\npart of Paul Gerhardt’s poem, “_Befiehl du deine Wege_” (558). These are\r\nstanzas 9, 10, 12, 13, unaltered, of Wesley’s translation, which\r\ncontains 16 four-line stanzas. Gerhardt passed through the agonies of\r\nthe Thirty Years’ War, and suffered, in addition, the loss of his wife\r\nand four children. He gives expression in this hymn to his own deep\r\nfeelings of trust and assurance. His words have helped many anxious\r\nsouls maintain faith in God who “sitteth on the throne, and ruleth all\r\nthings well.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Paul Gerhardt see Hymn 134.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Wesley, who translated the hymn, see No. 170.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ STATE STREET is a popular tune, scarcely any hymn book missing\r\nit, but it is not wedded to any single hymn. The composer, J. C.\r\nWoodman, 1813-94, born at Newbury, Mass., became one of Lowell Mason’s\r\nassistants in introducing music into the public schools of Boston. He\r\nwas one of the first soloists of the Boston Academy of Music and served\r\nfor a time as organist of the First Presbyterian Church of Brooklyn. In\r\n1858, Woodman compiled _The Musical Casket_, which contained many of his\r\nsongs, sacred and secular. “State Street” is the last tune in the book,\r\nset to Watts’ lyric, “Blessed are the sons of peace.”\r\n\r\n\r\n247. Day by day the manna fell                _Josiah Conder_, 1789-1855\r\n\r\nA hymn of confidence that God will supply daily strength for daily\r\nneeds, based on Exodus 16:12-21 and the petition in the Lord’s Prayer,\r\n“Give us this day our daily bread.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn suggests a Jewish story quoted by W. F. Tillett in _The Hymns\r\nand Hymn Writers of the Church_:\r\n\r\n  The pupils of Rabbi Ben Jochai once asked him with regard to the manna\r\n  sent to the Israelite host in the wilderness: “Why did not the Lord\r\n  furnish enough manna to Israel for a year all at one time?” “I will\r\n  answer you with a parable,” responded the teacher. “Once there was a\r\n  king who had a son to whom he gave a yearly allowance, paying him the\r\n  entire sum on a fixed day. It soon happened that the day on which the\r\n  allowance was due was the only day in the year when the father ever\r\n  saw the son. So the king changed his plan and gave his son day by day\r\n  that which sufficed for the day. And now the son visited his father\r\n  every morning. Thus God dealt with Israel.”\r\n\r\nThe author, Josiah Conder, born in London, was an editor and publisher.\r\nHis friends included a large number of eminent literary and church men\r\nof the early 19th century. He was a member of the Congregationalist\r\nChurch. A devout and earnest believer who knew what it was to struggle\r\nfor daily bread, he had the occasion to practice the gospel of daily\r\ntrust. He wrote many hymns, published more than a dozen scholarly books,\r\nand edited _The Congregational Hymn Book_ in 1836, a work which attained\r\nwide popularity in England.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SEYMOUR. For comments on this tune see Hymn No. 36.\r\n\r\n\r\n248. One thought I have, my ample creed           _Frederick L. Hosmer_,\r\n                                                               1840-1929\r\n\r\nSeveral of Hosmer’s hymns express his “thought of God,” this being one\r\nof the finest. It relates all of life and its needs to the thought of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Frederick L. Hosmer see Hymn 72.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PRAETORIUS is from _Harmoniae Hymnorum Scholae Gorlicensis_,\r\nGörlitz, 1599. It is supposed to have been written by M. Praetorius, for\r\nit appeared in his _Musae Sionae_, Pt. VI, 1609, and hence its name.\r\n\r\nMichael Praetorius, 1571-1621, was born in Kreuzburg, Thuringia. He was\r\neducated at the University of Frankfurt-an-der-Oder and became\r\nKapellmeister at Lüneburg. Praetorius was a prolific composer, but his\r\nfame rests chiefly on a four-volume work on musical theory entitled,\r\n_Syntagma musicum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n249. Father, to Thee we look in all our sorrow    _Frederick L. Hosmer_,\r\n                                                               1840-1929\r\n\r\nA hymn of comfort written in 1881 on the death of a member of the\r\nauthor’s congregation. The hymn was published in Hosmer’s _Thought of\r\nGod_, 1st series, 1885. The last lines are particularly striking:\r\n\r\n  “Yet shalt thou praise Him when these darkened furrows,\r\n    Where now He ploweth, wave with golden grain.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ STRENGTH AND STAY. For comments on J. B. Dykes, the composer of\r\nthis tune, see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n250. My Jesus, as Thou wilt               _Benjamin Schmolck_, 1672-1737\r\n                                           _Tr. Jane Borthwick_, 1813-97\r\n\r\nBased on Mark 14:36: “Abba, Father, all things are possible unto Thee;\r\ntake away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou\r\nwilt.” The hymn was originally published in eleven stanzas in his\r\n_Heilige Flammen_, 1704. We give here five stanzas of the original, our\r\nhymn being the usual selection of 1, 3, and 5.\r\n\r\n  Mein Jesu, wie du willt,\r\n    So lass mich allzeit wollen;\r\n  Wenn Trübsal, Angst und Leid\r\n    Mich hier betreffen sollen,\r\n  So gib, dass allezeit\r\n    Dein Wille werd’ erfüllt,\r\n  Ich leb’ und sterbe dir;\r\n    Mein Jesu, wie du willt!\r\n\r\n  Mein Jesu, wie du willt!\r\n    Soll ich in Armut leben,\r\n  So mach hingegen du\r\n    Die Seele reich, daneben\r\n  Gib, dass dein Wort mir nur\r\n    Den Hunger allzeit stillt,\r\n  Und nimm sonst alles hin:\r\n    Mein Jesu, wie du willt!\r\n\r\n  Mein Jesu, wie du willt!\r\n    Soll ich in Tränen schwimmen,\r\n  So lass mein Fünklein Trost\r\n    Nicht ganz und gar verglimmen.\r\n  Hast du doch selbst geweint;\r\n    Drum, wenn’s nicht anders gilt,\r\n  So wein’ ich auch mit dir.\r\n    Mein Jesu, wie du willt!\r\n\r\n  Mein Jesu, wie du willt!\r\n    Soll ich denn endlich sterben,\r\n  Ich weiss, du lässt mich auch\r\n    Im Sterben nicht verderben,\r\n  Wenn meine Seele sich\r\n    In deine Wunden hüllt;\r\n  Drum soll’s gestorben sein,\r\n    Mein Jesu, wie du willt!\r\n\r\n  Mein Jesu, wie du willt!\r\n    So bin ich auch zufrieden;\r\n  Hast du mir Lieb’ und Leid,\r\n    Not oder Tod beschieden,\r\n  So nehm’ ich’s auf dein Wort,\r\n    Dein Wille werd’ erfüllt.\r\n  Drum sag’ ich noch einmal:\r\n    Mein Jesu, wie du willt!\r\n\r\nSchmolck was known all over Germany for his many hymns and spiritual\r\nsongs. A number of them have been translated into English. This one\r\nreflects his fervent love for Christ and bears a message of trust and\r\ncomfort which grew out of his own exhausting labors and physical\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Benjamin Schmolck see Hymn 505.\r\n\r\nThe translation is by Jane Borthwick in her _Hymns from the Land of\r\nLuther_, 1854. For comments on Jane Borthwick see Hymn 54.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ JEWETT is from a melody in Weber’s opera _Der Freischütz_. The\r\npresent arrangement was made by Joseph Holbrook, in 1862. The tune has\r\nbecome associated almost exclusively with this hymn in America.\r\n\r\nJoseph Holbrook, 1822-88, born near Boston, was a tune writer of the\r\nschool of Mason, Hastings, and Bradbury. He compiled several hymn books\r\nand was musical editor of _Songs of the Sanctuary_, a popular Methodist\r\nbook under the editorship of the eminent hymnologist, Charles S.\r\nRobinson.\r\n\r\n\r\n251. Father, whate’er of earthly bliss            _Anne Steele_, 1716-78\r\n\r\nBased on I Tim. 6:6-8: “But godliness with contentment is great gain.\r\nFor we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry\r\nnothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.”\r\n\r\nAnne Steele was the first woman writer of English hymns. Her father was\r\na timber merchant who for 30 years was deacon and occasional preacher in\r\nthe Baptist Church in Hampshire, England, and then for 30 years more he\r\nwas pastor, without salary, of the same church. On the day before Miss\r\nSteele was to be married, at the age of 21, her fiance met accidental\r\ndeath through drowning. Out of this bitter experience in her early life\r\nand a succession of other trials, came this lyric of resignation and\r\nhope. The original has 10 stanzas, the last three of which have been\r\nedited by Augustus Toplady to make this her best hymn. Miss Steele is\r\nthe foremost of Baptist hymn writers.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NAOMI, a tune brought to America by Lowell Mason, was set to\r\nthis hymn in his _Modern Psalmist_, 1839. It at once gained popularity\r\nand was included in many hymn books.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Hans Nägeli, see Hymn 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n252. Thy way, not mine, O Lord                 _Horatius Bonar_, 1808-89\r\n\r\nAn admirable hymn of submission, faith, and love, based on Matt. 26:39:\r\n“Not as I will, but as Thou wilt.”\r\n\r\nIt was published in 7 stanzas in the author’s _Hymns of Faith and Hope_,\r\n1st series, 1857 under the title, “Thy way, not Mine.”\r\n\r\nThe omitted stanza (No. 6) reads:\r\n\r\n  Choose Thou for me my friends,\r\n    My sickness or my health:\r\n  Choose Thou my cares for me,\r\n    My poverty or my wealth.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Horatius Bonar see Hymn 129.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ O LEIDE, LEIDE GERN is from the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_, where\r\nit appears anonymously set to the words, “_O leide, leide, gern! Es ist\r\nder Will’ des Herrn_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n253. Lord, it belongs not to my care           _Richard Baxter_, 1615-91\r\n\r\nA hymn of love, trust, and hope, based on Phil. 1:21: “For me to live is\r\nChrist, and to die is gain.”\r\n\r\nRichard Baxter, English Presbyterian, was born in Shropshire, England.\r\nHe took holy orders in the Church of England, but withdrew from this\r\nchurch to become one of the outstanding Nonconformists of his time.\r\nThough he never attended university, he published over 250 volumes,\r\namong them several classics, _The Reformed Pastor_ and _The Saints’\r\nEverlasting Rest_. A fearless man and willing to suffer for what he\r\nbelieved to be right, Baxter did not hesitate to rebuke Cromwell for his\r\nassumption of supreme power of the State. Once, when falsely charged of\r\nlibeling the Church, Chief Justice George Jeffreys taunted him by,\r\n“Richard, I see the rogue in thy face.” Baxter replied, “I had not known\r\nbefore that my face was a mirror.” After an infamous trial, Baxter was\r\ncondemned and thrown into prison where he remained for 18 months.\r\n\r\nAs to music in the church, he did not share the views of the large\r\nnumber of his fellow Puritan clergymen who disapproved of it. “I have\r\nmade a psalm of praise in the holy assembly the chief delightful\r\nexercise of my religion and my life, and have helped to bear down all\r\nthe objection which I have heard against church music.” He also took a\r\nstand for the use of original hymns to supplement psalm singing, and\r\nfavored the use of the organ, though he did not introduce the latter\r\nwhere it led to disputes.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EVAN. For comments on this tune and its composer, William H.\r\nHavergal, see Hymn 153.\r\n\r\n\r\n254. Holy Father, cheer our way           _Richard H. Robinson_, 1842-92\r\n\r\nBased on Zech. 14:7: “But it shall come to pass, at evening time it\r\nshall be light.” The hymn was written in 1869 for the author’s\r\ncongregation, to be sung at evening prayer. It appeared in _Church\r\nHymns_, 1871, published by the Society for Propagating Christian\r\nKnowledge, London.\r\n\r\nRichard Hayes Robinson, a clergyman of the Church of England, was born\r\nin London. He was educated at King’s College, London, and served as\r\nminister in various churches. On the day of his second wedding, he was\r\ntaken ill on the train and died the next day. He published several\r\nvolumes of sermons.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MÜDE BIN ICH, GEH ZUR RUH is a well-known German melody in the\r\n_Gesangbuch mit Noten_, where it appears anonymously, set to Louise\r\nHensel’s hymn from which the tune derives its name. The melody, in\r\nslightly different form, appeared in 1842 in _Lieder-Buch für\r\nKleinkinder-Schulen ... con Theodor Fliedner_. It is used in the\r\n_Methodist Hymnal_ (1935) set to the words, “Jesus, tender Shepherd,\r\nhear.”\r\n\r\n\r\n255. O Lord, how happy should we be            _Joseph Anstice_, 1808-36\r\n\r\nBased on I Peter 5:7: “Casting all your care upon Him; for He careth for\r\nyou,” and on the Scripture lesson in Matthew 6:24-34. The original poem\r\nwas in five stanzas. The hymn was written out of experiences of\r\nsickness, pain, and trial.\r\n\r\nJoseph Anstice, a friend of Gladstone during student days at Oxford, was\r\nappointed Professor of Classical Literature at King’s College, London,\r\nat the age of 22. Within three years his health failed, and he died at\r\nthe age of 28, whereupon Gladstone, who had been deeply influenced by\r\nhim at Oxford, wrote in his _Diary_, “Read to my deep sorrow of\r\nAnstice’s death on Monday. His friends, his young widow, the world can\r\nspare him ill.” This and 53 other hymns were dictated to his wife in the\r\nafternoons during his last illness.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MERIBAH. For comments on the composer, Lowell Mason, see Hymn\r\n12.\r\n\r\n\r\n256. Peace, perfect peace             _Edward H. Bickersteth_, 1825-1906\r\n\r\nThis hymn on perfect peace is based on Isaiah 26:3: “Thou wilt keep him\r\nin perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee: because he trusteth in\r\nThee.”\r\n\r\nThe origin of the hymn was furnished Dr. Julian by Rev. S. Bickersteth,\r\na son of the author:\r\n\r\n  This hymn was written by Bishop Edward Henry Bickersteth while he was\r\n  spending his summer holiday in Harrogate in the year 1875. On a Sunday\r\n  morning in August the Vicar of Harrogate, Canon Gibbon, happened to\r\n  preach from the text, “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind\r\n  is stayed on thee,” and alluded to the fact that in the Hebrew the\r\n  words are “peace, peace,” twice repeated and happily rendered in the\r\n  1611 translations by the phrase “perfect peace.” This sermon set my\r\n  father’s mind working on the subject. He always found it easiest to\r\n  express in verse whatever subject was uppermost in his mind, so that\r\n  when on the afternoon of that Sunday he visited an aged and dying\r\n  relative, Archdeacon Hill, of Liverpool, and found him somewhat\r\n  troubled in mind, it was natural to him to express in verse the\r\n  spiritual comfort which he desired to convey. Taking up a sheet of\r\n  paper, he then and there wrote down the hymn just exactly as it now\r\n  stands and read it to this dying Christian.\r\n\r\n  It is not always noticed that the first line in each verse is in the\r\n  form of a question referring to some one or other of the disturbing\r\n  experiences of life, and the second line in each verse endeavors to\r\n  give the answer.... The hymn has been translated into many tongues,\r\n  and for years I doubt if my father went many days without receiving\r\n  from different people assurances of the comfort which the words had\r\n  been allowed to bring to them. The most touching occasion on which,\r\n  personally, I ever heard it sung was round the grave of my eldest\r\n  brother, Bishop Edward Bickersteth, of South Tokyo, at Chiselden in\r\n  1897, when my father himself was chief mourner.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PAX TECUM was written for this hymn by George Thomas Caldbeck,\r\n1852-?, concerning whose life one reads contradictory statements. Some\r\nwriters say he was a missionary in China when he wrote this tune;\r\nothers, including James Moffatt, give the account essentially as\r\nfollows: that Caldbeck, while a student in London, was compelled through\r\nill health to give up his purpose of becoming a missionary, went to\r\nIreland to teach school and engage in independent missionary work. Later\r\nhe returned to London where he did much open-air preaching, making a\r\nmeagre living by selling Scripture text-cards from door to door. For\r\nselling without a license, he was arrested one day but dismissed by the\r\njudge on being informed that the defendant was the composer of this\r\nwell-known hymn tune.\r\n\r\nThe tune was arranged by Charles John Vincent, born 1852, English\r\norganist, composer and editor of much church music.\r\n\r\n\r\n257. God is the refuge of His saints            _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nBased on Psalm 46:1-5: “God is our refuge and our strength; a very\r\npresent help in time of trouble,” etc., and was entitled by Watts, “The\r\nChurch’s Safety and Triumph.” It is interesting to compare this free\r\nrendering of the Psalm with that of the _Scotch Psalter_, 1650, (588),\r\nwhere the thought of the psalm and the stately King James version\r\ncombine to make up the greatest metrical form of the psalm. Martin\r\nLuther’s version of the same Psalm is found in his great hymn “_Ein\r\nfeste Burg ist unser Gott_” (549).\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WARRINGTON was composed by Ralph Harrison, 1748-1810, an\r\nEnglishman and son of a Presbyterian minister. Educated at Warrington\r\nAcademy, he became a noted teacher of ancient languages, but maintained\r\na keen interest in sacred music. He compiled _Sacred Harmony_, 2 vols.,\r\n1784-1791, a collection of psalm tunes, ancient and modern, in which\r\nwere found some of his own compositions, including this tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n258. Awake, our souls! away, our fears          _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nA free rendering of Isaiah 40:28-31.\r\n\r\nThe hymn is from Watts’ _Hymns and Spiritual Songs_, 1707, where it is\r\nheaded, “The Christian Race.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SAMSON. This tune is an adaptation, a very considerable one,\r\nfrom Chorus 31: “Then round about the starry throne,” in Handel’s\r\noratorio, _Samson_. The tune is taken from various parts of the chorus.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Handel see Hymn 70.\r\n\r\n\r\n259. There is no sorrow, Lord, too light        _Jane Crewdson_, 1809-63\r\n\r\nAnother of the “songs in the night,” written by one who, like Charlotte\r\nElliott (See 245), was an invalid the greater part of her life and\r\nsuffered much pain.\r\n\r\nJane Fox was born in Cornwall, England. In 1836 she married Thomas D.\r\nCrewdson, a Manchester manufacturer. Always delicate, she became a\r\nconfirmed invalid, but her sufferings served to deepen her spiritual\r\nlife. She was a woman of fine intellectual power and poetic gifts and\r\nthrough her writings testified gloriously to the all-sufficiency of her\r\nSavior’s love. Her attitude toward her suffering is well expressed in\r\nthe beautiful third verse of the hymn:\r\n\r\n  There is no secret sigh we breathe\r\n    But meets Thine ear divine:\r\n  And every cross grows light beneath\r\n    The shadow, Lord, of thine.\r\n\r\nThis was the favorite hymn of Dr. John Henry Jowett, at one time\r\nminister of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, New York City.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ COOLING first appeared in _The American Choir_, 1858. No\r\ninformation has been obtained concerning the composer, Alonzo Judson\r\nAbbey, 1825-87.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ETERNAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n260. Hark, hark, my soul! angelic songs are swelling       _Frederick W.\r\n                                                         Faber_, 1814-63\r\n\r\nA lovely song of the journey of life—the Christian’s pilgrimage to\r\nheaven, the heart’s true home. “The Pilgrims of the Night” was the title\r\ngiven this hymn by its author, F. W. Faber, the warm-hearted Roman\r\nCatholic hymn writer. The phrases of the poem are wrapped in mystery and\r\nloveliness. Their meaning is not always clear but the rhythm and musical\r\nring of the hymn are effective and its popularity is genuine and\r\nwide-spread.\r\n\r\nFor comments on F. W. Faber see Hymn 44.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PILGRIMS was written for this hymn for the appendix to the\r\noriginal edition of _Hymns Ancient and Modern_.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Henry Smart, see Hymn 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n261. Forever, with the Lord!               _James Montgomery_, 1771-1854\r\n\r\nFrom Montgomery’s poem of twenty-two 4-line stanzas, in two parts,\r\npublished in the _Amethyst_, 1835. It is based on I Thess. 4:17: “Then\r\nwe which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in\r\nthe clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with\r\nthe Lord.” Canon Farrar once said, “I can scarcely ever join in singing\r\n‘Forever with the Lord’ without tears.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn voices the aspirations of multitudes of Christians. In time of\r\nsorrow and death it points to the life beyond as the true goal of all\r\nour earthly striving.\r\n\r\nFor comments on James Montgomery see Hymn 62.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NEARER HOME, also called “Montgomery,” was composed for this\r\nhymn and was published in _The Choral Advocate_, 1852. The composer,\r\nIsaac Baker Woodbury, 1819-58, was an American singer, teacher of music,\r\ncomposer of hymn tunes and sacred songs, and editor of _Musical Review_.\r\nHis career was cut short by his death at the early age of thirty-nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n262. Jerusalem the golden               _Bernard of Cluny_, 12th century\r\n                                            _Tr. John M. Neale_, 1818-66\r\n\r\n“And the city was pure gold” Rev. 21:21.\r\n\r\nThis hymn is from a Latin manuscript of 3,000 lines entitled “_De\r\nContemptu Mundi_” (On Contempt of the World), written by Bernard of\r\nCluny while he was a monk at the famous monastery of Cluny, France, _c._\r\n1145. Practically nothing is known of him except his authorship of this\r\npoem. Two other hymns, “Brief life is here our portion,” and “For thee,\r\nO dear, dear country,” not in the _Hymnary_, are taken from the same\r\npoem. The original was not written as a hymn at all but as a “bitter\r\nsatire on the fearful corruption of the age,” especially of the Church\r\nof Rome, in contrast to which the author paints the joys of the new\r\nJerusalem. The author employed throughout the unusually difficult meter\r\nknown as “dactylic hexameter with tailed rhymes,” of which Bernard\r\nhimself says: “Unless the Spirit of wisdom and understanding had flowed\r\nin upon me, I could not have put together so long a work in so difficult\r\na meter.” The reading of the Latin stanzas best reveal the rhythm and\r\nmusic of the original:\r\n\r\n                                   1.\r\n  Urbs Sion aurea, patria lactea,\r\n      Cive decora,\r\n  Omne cor obruis, omnibus obstruis\r\n      Et cor et ora.\r\n\r\n                                   2.\r\n  Nescio, nescio, quae iubilatio,\r\n      Lux tibi qualis,\r\n  Quam socialia gaudia, gloria\r\n      Quam specialis.\r\n\r\n                                   3.\r\n  Sunt Sion atria coniubilantia,\r\n      Martyre plena,\r\n  Cive micantia, principe stantia,\r\n      Luce serena.\r\n\r\n                                   4.\r\n  Sunt ibi pascua mentibus afflua\r\n      Praestita sanctis;\r\n  Regis ibi thronus, agminis et sonus\r\n      Est epulantis.\r\n\r\n                                   5.\r\n  Gens duce splendida, contio candida\r\n      Vestibus albis,\r\n  Sunt sine fletibus in Sion aedibus,\r\n      Aedibus almis. Amen.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, John M. Neale, see Hymn 67.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EWING, composed for “For thee, O dear, dear country” (see\r\nabove), was originally in triple time and named, “St. Bedes.” In _Hymns\r\nAncient and Modern_, 1861, it was set to the present words and the tune\r\nchanged to common time without the consent of the composer. Ewing\r\ndisliked the change and expressed himself thus: “In my opinion the\r\nalteration of the rhythm has very much vulgarized my little tune. It now\r\nseems to be a good deal like a polka. I hate to hear it.” In spite of\r\nthe composer’s opinion, the tune is generally accepted in its revised\r\nform and considered preferable to the original.\r\n\r\nAlexander Ewing, 1830-95, of Aberdeen, Scotland, was a skilled musician.\r\nOne evening after choir practice, he modestly introduced what he called\r\nhis first effort at writing a hymn tune, offering copies of the voice\r\nparts, and asking the choir to sing it over. This was done, the choir\r\nliked it, and the tune EWING was launched on its long and popular\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n\r\n263. Jerusalem the golden               _Bernard of Cluny_, 12th century\r\n                                            _Tr. John M. Neale_, 1818-66\r\n\r\nFor comments on this hymn see No. 262.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ URBS BEATA (The City Beautiful) was composed in 1887 for these\r\nwords. The composer found words for the refrain by repeating lines 1, 6,\r\n7, and 8 of the first stanza. It makes a first-rate choir number. To\r\nkeep up the proper tempo it should be sung with two beats to the\r\nmeasure. When the tune is used for congregational singing, the high\r\nnotes in the refrain are intended to be sung by the sopranos in the\r\nchoir.\r\n\r\nThe composer, George LeJeune, 1842-1904, was the son of a well-known\r\nmusical family in London. He began his musical career in Canada; later\r\nhe studied with Joseph Barnby. His great work was done as church\r\norganist and organ recitalist at St. John’s Chapel of Trinity Parish,\r\nNew York City, where he served 28 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n264. One sweetly solemn thought                   _Phoebe Cary_, 1824-71\r\n\r\nA poem in contemplation of heaven, written in 1852, entitled, “Nearer\r\nHome,” with no thought of its being used as a hymn. In fact its original\r\nirregular rhythm hardly permitted it to be sung. The words have been\r\nchanged to fit the short-meter tune, and have become popular as a hymn.\r\nUpon reading the story of how the hymn was instrumental in the\r\nconversion of two gamblers in China, who, after betting and drinking and\r\ncard playing, decided upon a change of life and consecrated themselves\r\nto Christian work, Miss Cary wrote to a friend:\r\n\r\n  I enclose the hymn and story for you, not because I am vain of the\r\n  notice, but because I thought you would feel a peculiar interest in\r\n  them when you knew the hymn was written eighteen years ago (1852) in\r\n  your house. I composed it in the little, back, third-story bedroom on\r\n  Sunday morning after coming from church, and it makes me happy to\r\n  think that any word I could say has done a little good in the world.\r\n\r\nPhoebe Cary was born on a farm near Cincinnati, Ohio. Her early days\r\nwere a struggle with hardship and poverty. “I have cried in the street\r\nbecause I was poor,” she wrote in her later and more prosperous years,\r\n“and the poor always seem nearer to me than the rich.” With her sister\r\nAlice Carey, she published a small volume of verse in 1849, then the two\r\nmoved to New York City where they became quiet but influential leaders\r\nin literary society. Their friendship with Whittier was a noted factor\r\nin the lives of the Carey sisters. Phoebe was a member of the Church of\r\nthe Pilgrims in New York, and later attended the Church of the Stranger\r\nin the same city.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DULCE DOMUM is an arrangement from the composer’s popular song,\r\n“One sweetly solemn song,” later published as an anthem.\r\n\r\nRobert Steele Ambrose, 1824-1908, born in England, came with his parents\r\nto Canada in his first year. He prepared himself for the musical\r\nprofession and became organist successively in churches in Guelph,\r\nKingston, and Hamilton, Ontario. He is known best by the above-mentioned\r\nsong.\r\n\r\n\r\n265. Sunset and evening star                  _Alfred Tennyson_, 1809-92\r\n\r\nA song of immortality, written in ten minutes in the author’s\r\neighty-first year. It is always printed at the end of Tennyson’s poems.\r\nTennyson once said: “I can hardly understand how any great, imaginative\r\nman, who has lived, suffered, thought and wrought, can doubt of the\r\nsoul’s continuous progress in the after life.”\r\n\r\nThe poem was written on an October day in 1889, as the poet was crossing\r\nfrom Aldworth to Farringford. Tennyson’s son wrote in his _Memoir_ of\r\nhis father, concerning its origin:\r\n\r\n  Before he reached Farringford he had the moaning of the bar in his\r\n  mind, and after dinner he showed me this poem written out. I said:\r\n  “That is the crown of your life’s work.” He answered: “It came in a\r\n  moment.” He explained the “Pilot” as “that Divine and Unseen who is\r\n  always guiding us.” A few days before my father’s death, in 1892, he\r\n  said to me: “Mind you put ‘Crossing the Bar,’ at the end of all\r\n  editions of my poems.” My father considered Edmund Lushington’s\r\n  translation into Greek of “Crossing the Bar” one of the finest\r\n  translations he had ever read.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CROSSING THE BAR was composed for these words. The tune, in the\r\nnature of an unaccompanied quartet anthem, may be sung with freedom in\r\nregard to time and shading.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Joseph Barnby, see Hymn 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n266. Blest be the everlasting God               _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nA paraphrase of I Peter 1:3-5.\r\n\r\nThe original by Watts was published in his _Hymns and Spiritual Songs_,\r\n1707, from which it was taken over unchanged into the _Scottish\r\nParaphrases_ of 1745 and of 1751. In the final 1781 edition, the third\r\nstanza was omitted and the fourth altered from\r\n\r\n  There’s an inheritance divine\r\n    Reserved against that day;\r\n  ’Tis incorrupted, undefiled,\r\n    And cannot waste away.\r\n\r\nThe improvements are attributed to William Cameron, 1751-1811, who, as a\r\nyoung licentiate, was entrusted with the final revision of the _Scottish\r\nParaphrases_.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. STEPHEN (ABRIDGE) is described by Archibald Jacob as a\r\n“beautifully fluent and graceful melody ... in the best 18th-century\r\nstyle of this class of tune.” It appeared originally in _A Collection of\r\nPsalm Tunes in Three Parts_ ... by Isaac Smith, _c._ 1770, under the\r\nname ABRIDGE, by which it continues to be known in England. In _Sacred\r\nHarmony for Use in St. George’s_, Edinburgh, 1820, it appeared under the\r\nname ST. STEPHEN, with slight modification of the last line.\r\n\r\nIsaac Smith, _c._ 1725-_c._ 1800, was a London linen-draper with a taste\r\nfor music. He composed and published a number of Psalm-tunes which long\r\nremained popular, though ABRIDGE is almost the only one now left of his\r\ncompositions. Smith named his tunes after localities in and about\r\nLondon. ABRIDGE was the name of a small village near Epping Forest, in\r\nEssex.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE KINGDOM OF GOD\r\n\r\n\r\n267. Forward through the ages           _Frederick L. Hosmer_, 1840-1929\r\n\r\nA hymn expressing the unity of God’s people in their labor for the\r\nKingdom through the ages. “The goodly fellowship of the prophets” is set\r\nforth here with power and poetic beauty.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Frederick L. Hosmer see Hymn 72.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ONWARD, with its strong rhythm and moving power, lends itself\r\nwell for processional use, resembling in this respect the tune “St.\r\nGertrude” (225), for which the present hymn was written.\r\n\r\nNo information is at hand concerning the composer, J. W. Barrington.\r\n\r\n\r\n268. Thy Kingdom come, on bended knee   _Frederick L. Hosmer_, 1840-1929\r\n\r\nOne of the few hymns written on the petition, “Thy Kingdom come,” in the\r\nLord’s Prayer. Canon Percy Dearmer speaks of this as “one of the noblest\r\nhymns in the language.” It is a fervent prayer for the day when there\r\nshall be more justice, knowledge, peace, and righteousness on the earth.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written June 21, 1891, for the commencement of the\r\nMeadville Theological School, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Frederick L. Hosmer see Hymn 72.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ IRISH, also called “Dublin,” appeared first in _Hymns and\r\nSacred Poems_, published in Dublin in 1749. The composer is not known.\r\nIt is a smooth, triple-time tune which young people love to sing. Its\r\nname is misleading, for there is no indication of an Irish origin other\r\nthan, as stated, its appearance in a book published in Dublin.\r\n\r\n\r\n269. Come, Kingdom of our God                      _John Johns_, 1801-47\r\n\r\nA prayer for the coming of the Kingdom of God on earth, based on the\r\npetition in the Lord’s Prayer, “Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done.”\r\n\r\nRev. John Johns, English Presbyterian minister, was known for many years\r\nin Liverpool as the “minister to the poor.” He was a man of fine poetic\r\ngifts and published several volumes of poetry but is remembered for his\r\nlife of service among the poor.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. THOMAS is one of the oldest and best tunes of the church.\r\nIt has good rhythm, graceful form, and a strong forward movement to give\r\nit unusual singing merit.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Aaron Williams, of Welsh descent, was born in London in\r\n1731, and died there in 1776. He was composer, engineer, publisher,\r\nmusic teacher, and clerk of the Scotch Church, London Wall. He published\r\na number of important collections of tunes: _The Universal Psalmodist_,\r\n1763, and _New Universal Psalmodist_, 1770, in which the above tune\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n270. Thy Kingdom come, O Lord           _Frederick L. Hosmer_, 1840-1929\r\n\r\nAnother hymn on the petition, “Thy Kingdom come,” in the Lord’s Prayer,\r\nsetting forth its coming in relation to the unity of nations. Compare\r\nHosmer’s other hymn on the Kingdom (268) where the emphasis is on\r\nrighteousness and justice. This is an appropriate hymn for use in\r\ngatherings concerned with Christian unity and world friendship.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Frederick L. Hosmer see Hymn 72.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ INVITATION. For comments on the composer of this tune see Hymn\r\n112.\r\n\r\n\r\n271. Thy Kingdom come, O God                  _Lewis Hensley_, 1824-1905\r\n\r\nAnother of the few hymns that have been written on the petition in the\r\nLord’s Prayer, “Thy Kingdom come.” See Hymns 268, 269, 270.\r\n\r\nLewis Hensley had a distinguished career at Trinity College, Cambridge,\r\nEngland, as student and then six years as fellow and tutor. He became a\r\nminister in the Church of England and for a time was Rural Dean.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. CECILIA was composed for Dr. Bonar’s hymn, “Thy way, not\r\nmine, O Lord” (252), appearing with these words in _The Merton Tune\r\nBook_, Oxford, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Rev. Leighton George Hayne, 1836-83, was educated at\r\nOxford, took holy orders in 1861, was appointed conductor of the chorus\r\nof the University and public examiner in the School of Music, and then\r\nserved for a time as organist of Eton College. The last 12 years of his\r\nlife were spent as minister in various churches. He wrote many hymn\r\ntunes and edited, with Rev. H. W. Sargeant, _The Merton Tune Book_.\r\n\r\n\r\n272. Before Jehovah’s awful throne              _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nA paraphrase of Psalm 100, revised by John Wesley.\r\n\r\nThe original text by Watts began:\r\n\r\n  Sing to the Lord with joyful voice;\r\n    Let every land his name adore;\r\n  The British Isles shall sound the noise\r\n    Across the ocean to the shore.\r\n\r\nWesley, considering this an unpromising initial stanza, omitted it, and\r\nchanged the second stanza, lines 1 and 2, from\r\n\r\n  Nations attend before his throne\r\n    With solemn fear, with sacred joy\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n  Before Jehovah’s awful throne\r\n    Ye nations bow with sacred joy.\r\n\r\nWesley severely condemned the practice of changing another’s hymns, but\r\nin this case his own “transgression” resulted in a greatly improved\r\nhymn.\r\n\r\nThe word “awful” in the first line is spelled “awe-full” in some hymnals\r\nin order to convey more nearly its original meaning.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts, see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PARK STREET was composed by Frederick M. A. Venua, 1788-1872,\r\nan eminent French organist, a native of Paris. It is a favorite tune in\r\nAmerica where it is invariably associated with this hymn by Watts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\n273. The Church’s one foundation            _Samuel J. Stone_, 1839-1900\r\n\r\nA truly great hymn, honoring the church of Christ and longing for its\r\nprosperity. The author, then a young curate of 27 years in the Church of\r\nEngland, was so stirred by the attacks made on the church in his time\r\nthat he determined to write a series of twelve hymns on the Apostles’\r\nCreed. This one is based on the article, “I believe in the holy Catholic\r\nChurch, the communion of saints.” The controversy which then raged in\r\nEngland concerning the nature of the inspiration of the Scriptures is\r\nreflected in the third stanza, the author leaning strongly on the\r\nconservative side.\r\n\r\nSamuel J. Stone was a clergyman of the Church of England, born in\r\nStaffordshire, and educated at Oxford. He served various churches,\r\nfinally succeeding his father at St. Paul’s, Haggerston, London. For\r\ntwenty years he had a fruitful ministry in this East End parish among\r\nthe poor and depraved, before moving to another part of the city to\r\nanother church. He is the author of many hymns and translations and\r\npublished several volumes of poetry.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ AURELIA (signifying “golden”) one of our most stately tunes,\r\ncombining ease of singing with churchly dignity, was written for the\r\nhymn, “Jerusalem the golden” (262). It was set to the present hymn in\r\n_Hymns Ancient and Modern_ and did much to carry the hymn into the\r\nchurches. It has become one of the great processional hymns of the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nSamuel Sebastian Wesley, 1810-76, grandson of Charles Wesley, was like\r\nhis father, Samuel Wesley, a great English composer and organist. He had\r\na consuming love of the outdoors, as well as of music, and was\r\npassionately fond of fishing. He was outspoken in his demands for reform\r\nin the music of the church and was, consequently, frequently at odds\r\nwith his superiors. Wesley received inadequate recognition for the\r\ncontributions he made to the music of his time.\r\n\r\n\r\n274. Glorious things of thee are spoken         _John Newton_, 1725-1807\r\n\r\nBased on Psalm 87:3: “Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of\r\nGod,” and other passages, especially Isaiah 33:20, 21, and Exodus 13:22.\r\n\r\nIt is one of our best hymns on the Church and, says Julian, “It ranks\r\nwith the first hymns in the language.” In ordinary use the omission of\r\nthe third stanza is desirable. Augustine Smith suggests in _Lyric\r\nReligion_ that “the last score should always be repeated, the second\r\ntime sung broader and fuller, building into a superb climax.”\r\n\r\nJohn Newton is remembered among the hymn writers because of the radical\r\nchange that took place in his life at conversion. Born in London, his\r\nonly schooling was from his eighth to his tenth year. He went to sea at\r\neleven, his godly mother following the profligate youth with her\r\nprayers. As a midshipman in the navy he deserted his post, was captured,\r\nand reduced to a common seaman, and later became a servant of a slave\r\ndealer in Africa. He was converted at 23 after an awful night steering a\r\nwater-logged ship in the face of death. Though converted, he retained\r\ncertain blind spots in his social outlook and he continued as a slave\r\ndealer. This hymn was written when he was on a voyage from Sierra Leone,\r\nAfrica, with a load of slaves shackled closely together and being taken\r\nto London or America to be sold. “I have never had such sweet communion\r\nwith Jesus as I had on that voyage,” he wrote. This may seem like\r\nhypocrisy, but it must be remembered that slavery was a common practice\r\nand that only a few people of the time understood clearly its complete\r\ndenial of the spirit of Christ. It may be that future generations will\r\nsee in our times evils that flourished unchallenged while we prayed and\r\nsang according to the light we had. In 1750, Newton married Mary\r\nCatlett, a noble and pious woman, and a godsend in his life. In 1755, he\r\nsettled down as customs officer in Liverpool, becoming at the same time\r\ngreatly interested in Wesley and Whitefield and other evangelical\r\nleaders. Three years later he became a minister in the Church of\r\nEngland, and in 1764, he began a distinguished career as curate at\r\nOlney, where he was associated with his friend, William Cowper, the\r\npoet. The two were joint authors of the _Olney Hymns_, 1779. After\r\nsixteen years in Olney, he moved to London where for 28 years he did\r\nfaithful and successful work as rector of St. Mary Woolnoth. He wrote\r\nhis own epitaph which is found on a plain marble tablet near the vestry\r\ndoor of his church in London:\r\n\r\n                           John Newton, Clerk\r\n                     Once an Infidel and Libertine,\r\n                     A servant of slaves in Africa,\r\n             Was, by the rich mercy of our Lord and Saviour\r\n                              Jesus Christ\r\n                   Preserved, restored, and pardoned,\r\n                   And appointed to preach the Faith\r\n                    He had long labored to destroy,\r\n                    Near 16 years at Olney in Bucks\r\n                      And ... years in this church\r\n                      On Feb. 1, 1750, he married\r\n                                 Mary,\r\n                  Daughter of the late George Catlett\r\n                            Of Catham, Kent.\r\n                He resigned her to the Lord who gave her\r\n                       On 15th of December, 1790\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ AUSTRIAN HYMN is founded on a Croatian melody. It was used in\r\nGermany as the tune of “Deutschland über alles.” Joseph Haydn,\r\n1732-1809, made a setting of it to be sung at the Emperor’s birthday,\r\nFeb. 12, 1797, to the words, “Gott erhalte Franz der Kaiser.” The tune\r\nwas a great favorite of Haydn and he used it as a theme in one of the\r\nmovements in his famous “_Emperor Quartet_,” No. 76.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Franz Joseph Haydn, see Hymn 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n275. I love Thy Kingdom, Lord                _Timothy Dwight_, 1752-1817\r\n\r\nBased on Psalm 137:5, 6: “If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right\r\nhand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave\r\nto the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.”\r\nIt is rated high among all the hymns on the church and is probably the\r\nearliest American hymn in use today.\r\n\r\nTimothy Dwight, the great president of Yale, was the grandson of\r\nJonathan Edwards and shared in a large measure the intellectual\r\nbrilliance of the Edwards family. A precocious youth, he entered Yale\r\nCollege at 13 and graduated at 17. An outstanding personality of his\r\ntime, he was honored for his sound scholarship, elected a member of the\r\nMassachusetts legislature, and served as minister of the Congregational\r\nChurch at Greenfield, Conn. From 1795 until his death in 1817, he was\r\nPresident of Yale, simultaneously holding the Chair of Theology. His\r\npresence at Yale changed the whole moral and religious attitude of the\r\ncampus, there having been only four or five professed Christians at the\r\ncollege, according to Prof. W. W. Sweet, when he became president. At\r\nthe request of the General Association of Congregational Churches in\r\nConnecticut and with the concurrence of the Presbyterian General\r\nAssembly, he revised _The Psalms of David_, by I. Watts, a work which\r\nwas used in the Presbyterian and Congregational Churches of Connecticut\r\nfor over 30 years.\r\n\r\nDwight did a prodigious amount of work in spite of a serious physical\r\nhandicap. His eyesight, for the greater part of forty years, was so poor\r\nthat his reading was done only with the greatest of difficulty and with\r\nfrequent and agonizing pain behind the eyeballs.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ STATE STREET. For comments on this tune see Hymn 246.\r\n\r\n\r\n276. O where are kings and empires now         _Arthur C. Coxe_, 1818-96\r\n\r\nFrom a larger poem by Coxe, entitled “Chelsea,” containing ten stanzas\r\nof eight lines each. It is a hymn of confidence that the church, built\r\non a solid foundation, will survive all earthly kings and empires and\r\nwill be able to withstand every earthly foe.\r\n\r\nArthur Cleveland Coxe was born at Clifton Springs, N. Y.; graduated from\r\nthe University of New York and General Theological Seminary; and then\r\nbecame the rector successively of St. John’s Church, Hartford, Conn.;\r\nGrace Church, Baltimore; and Calvary Church, New York City. In 1865, he\r\nwas elected Bishop of Western New York. He was a member of the Hymnal\r\nCommission for the Protestant Episcopal Church, which compiled the\r\n_Hymnal_ of 1872, but refused, out of modesty, permission to include in\r\nthat work any of his own hymns.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. ANNE. For comments on this tune see Hymn 61.\r\n\r\n\r\n277. Christ is made the sure foundation      _Latin, 6th or 7th century_\r\n                                            _Tr. John M. Neale_, 1818-66\r\n\r\nFrom Part II of an ancient Latin hymn of the 6th or 7th century\r\nbeginning: “_Urbs beata Hierusalem_.” The author is not known. The first\r\nverse reflects Ephesians 2:20-21: “And are built upon the foundation of\r\nthe apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief\r\ncornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto\r\nan holy temple in the Lord.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn is often used at the dedication of churches, stanzas 3 and 4\r\nbeing especially appropriate for that purpose.\r\n\r\nDr. Neale’s translation of the hymn, in nine stanzas, appeared in his\r\n_Medieval Hymns_, 1851. Our hymn is a selection of stanzas 5, 6, 7, and\r\n8, of his translation, with some changes in the words. The Latin of our\r\nfirst three stanzas is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Angularis fundamentum\r\n    lapis Christus missus est\r\n  Qui compage parietis\r\n    in utroque nectitur,\r\n  Quem Sion sancta suscepit,\r\n    In quo credens permanet.\r\n\r\n  Hoc in templo, summe Deus,\r\n    exoratus adveni,\r\n  Et clementi bonitate\r\n    precum vota suscipe;\r\n  Largam benedictionem\r\n    his infunde iugiter.\r\n\r\n  Hic promereantur omnes\r\n    petita adquirere\r\n  Et adepta possidere\r\n    cum sanctis perenniter,\r\n  Paradisum introire,\r\n    translati in requiem.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John M.

Lord of our life, and God of our salvation          _Philip Pusey_,\r\n                                                               1799-1855\r\n                           _Based on Matthäus von Löwenstern_, 1594-1648\r\n\r\nOne of the “songs of the night,” the original of which was written out\r\nof the bitter experiences of the Thirty Years’ War in Germany. It tells\r\nof the peril to which the Reformed Church was then exposed but expresses\r\nconfidence that the church, founded upon the Rock, will prevail against\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nMatthäus Apelles von Löwenstern, son of a saddler, had musical and\r\nbusiness ability which won him recognition and employment by the Duke of\r\nMünsterberg and the Emperors Ferdinand II and his son Ferdinand III. He\r\nwrote about 30 hymns and set them to melodies of his own composition.\r\nHis hymn, named “Sapphic Ode. For Spiritual and Temporal Peace,” in\r\n1644, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Christe, du Beistand deiner Kreuzgemeine,\r\n  Eile, mit Hilf’ und Rettung uns erscheine;\r\n  Steure den Feinden, ihre Blutgerichte\r\n    Mache zunichte!\r\n\r\n  Streite doch selber für uns arme Kinder,\r\n  Wehre dem Teufel, seine Macht verhinder’;\r\n  Alles, was kämpfet wider deine Glieder,\r\n    Stürze danieder!\r\n\r\n  Frieden bei Kirch’ und Schulen uns beschere,\r\n  Frieden zugleich der Obrigkeit gewähre,\r\n  Frieden dem Herzen, Frieden dem Gewissen\r\n    Gib zu geniessen!\r\n\r\n  Also wird zeitlich deine Güt’ erhoben,\r\n  Also wird ewig und ohn’ Ende loben\r\n  Dich, o du Wächter deiner armen Herde,\r\n    Himmel und Erde.\r\n\r\nThe English version by Pusey is not a translation of the German but\r\nrather a free paraphrase. Philip Pusey, brother of Edward Pusey, the\r\nfamous leader in the Oxford Movement, was educated at Oxford. After\r\ngraduating he settled on his estate and devoted himself largely to\r\nagriculture. He wrote extensively on agricultural subjects and was one\r\nof the founders of the Royal Agriculture Society. Later he became a\r\nmember of Parliament. He wrote this hymn to portray the state of the\r\nChurch of England at the time, which he described as being “assailed\r\nfrom without, enfeebled and detracted from within, but on the eve of a\r\ngreat awakening.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ INTEGER VITAE.

Dear Shepherd of Thy people                _John Newton_, 1725-1807\r\n\r\nA hymn composed for a prayer meeting.\r\n\r\nJohn Newton and William Cowper, the English poet, instituted prayer\r\nmeetings at Olney where the two labored together in a famous ministry,\r\nNewton as minister of the church, and Cowper as his voluntary assistant.\r\nThe prayer meetings were attended in such large numbers that it became\r\nnecessary to move the services into a large room. For the first meeting\r\nin this new room, each of the men prepared a special hymn, the one by\r\nNewton being our hymn, with his first, third, and seventh stanzas\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on John Newton see Hymn 274.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DURHAM appeared in _Ravenscroft’s Psalter_, 1621, set to Psalms\r\n28 and 76, and marked as a “Northern Tune.” The _Scottish Psalter_ of\r\n1635 includes it among the Common Tunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n280. Again, as evening’s shadow falls       _Samuel Longfellow_, 1819-92\r\n\r\n“Vesper Hymn” is the title which this hymn bears in the author’s volume,\r\n_Vespers_, 1859, a small book of songs prepared for use in evening\r\nservices. In a letter dated Feb. 11, 1890, Longfellow wrote, “My two\r\nfavorites among my hymns are the vesper hymn, ‘Again, as evening’s\r\nshadow falls,’ and the one beginning, ‘I look to Thee in every need’”\r\n(244).\r\n\r\nFor comments on Samuel Longfellow see Hymn 28.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GERMANY.

Baker_, 1821-77\r\n\r\nBased on Psalm 26:8: “Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house,\r\nand the place where thine honor dwelleth.” The hymn was written by\r\nWilliam Bullock, then a young sailor-missionary, for the dedication of a\r\nmission chapel at Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, in 1827. Seventy years\r\nlater, when a new church located on the same site was dedicated, this\r\nhymn as revised by H. W. Baker, was once more sung. The sermon preached\r\nby Bullock at the opening of the chapel was read to the people.\r\n\r\nWm. Bullock was educated at Christ’s Hospital and then entered the Royal\r\nNavy. While on a survey of the coast of Newfoundland, he decided to\r\ndevote himself to missionary work in that colony. He did this and served\r\n32 years under the Society for Propagating the Gospel. He became Dean of\r\nNova Scotia at Halifax. In 1854, he published _Songs of the Church_\r\nwhich, he said, were “written amid the various scenes of missionary\r\nlife, and are intended for the private and domestic use of Christians in\r\nnew countries deprived of all public worship.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Henry W. Baker, reviser of the hymn see Hymn 143.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ QUAM DILECTA was composed for this hymn in _Hymns Ancient and\r\nModern_, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Henry L. Jenner, 1820-98, was a curate in the Anglican\r\nChurch. After serving various churches in England, he was consecrated\r\nfirst Bishop of Dunedin, New Zealand, 1866. He was one of the Cambridge\r\ngroup which revived interest in ecclesiology, ancient hymnology,\r\nplainsong, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n282. Unto Thy temple, Lord, we come          _Robert Collyer_, 1823-1912\r\n\r\nA hymn describing the church as the home of “rich and poor, bond and\r\nfree, great and small.” It is suitable for the general worship service\r\nand especially for the dedication of a church.\r\n\r\nInformation concerning the author, Robert Collyer, has not been traced.\r\n_Julian’s Dictionary_ notes a William Collyer, 1782-1854, eminent\r\nEnglish evangelical preacher who was ordained for a small church of ten\r\ncommunicant members. He is described as a man of “amiable disposition,\r\npolished manners, Christian courtesy, and popular with rich and poor\r\nalike; who labored in the church with great success and honor until his\r\ndeath.” He wrote numerous hymns. Was our hymn written by a son brought\r\nup with his father’s noble conception of the church?\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MENDON. For comments on this tune see Hymn 211.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE LORD’S DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n283. The dawn of God’s dear Sabbath                  _Ada Cross_, 1844-?\r\n\r\nA hymn on the Sabbath, picturing the day as a time when weary souls may\r\nturn from daily toil to refresh themselves with the water of life drawn\r\nfrom the wells of salvation.\r\n\r\nAda Cross was born in England, November 21, 1844, the daughter of Henry\r\nCambridge. She married an Australian, the Rev. George F. Cross, and\r\nspent most of her life in Australia where her husband was minister of\r\nthe Anglican Church in Coleraine, Victoria. She was interested in the\r\nliturgy of the Church and issued several collections of hymns.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ENDSLEIGH is credited to Salvatore Ferretti, 1817-74,\r\nconcerning whom no information has been traced. The arrangement was made\r\nby James Turle, 1802-82, an English teacher of music, a distinguished\r\norganist, and composer of hymn tunes, chants, and anthems. For\r\nsixty-three years he was connected with Westminster Abbey in London. He\r\nwas endowed, it is said, with unusually large hands so that he could\r\neasily span an octave and a half with one hand. His sole musical\r\ninterest was in serving the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n284. Safely through another week                _John Newton_, 1725-1807\r\n\r\nThis hymn was composed by Newton for use on Saturday evening. To give it\r\nwider usefulness, the verses were slightly changed to make them suitable\r\nfor the Sunday morning service.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Newton see Hymn 274.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SABBATH was written for this hymn in 1824.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Lowell Mason, see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n285. O day of rest and gladness        _Christopher Wordsworth_, 1807-85\r\n\r\nA hymn which serves to keep vividly before us the meaning and value of\r\nthe Lord’s Day. It appears as the opening hymn in the author’s _The Holy\r\nYear_, 1862, where it is entitled “Sunday.” It is based on Psalm 118:24:\r\n“This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad\r\nin it.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Christopher Wordsworth see Hymn 174.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MENDEBRAS was written for this hymn in 1839. It is an\r\narrangement by Lowell Mason of a German folk song.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Lowell Mason see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n286. Again returns the day of holy rest         _William Mason_, 1725-97\r\n\r\nThe author of this Lord’s Day hymn was the Rev. William Mason, an\r\nEnglish Episcopalian, born at Kingston-on-Hull. He graduated with honors\r\nfrom St. John’s College, Cambridge; received ordination, served as one\r\nof the chaplains of King George III, and at the time of death he had\r\nbeen for 32 years the Precentor and Canon of York. A man of high\r\nliterary attainments, and a friend of Thomas Gray, he edited that poet’s\r\nworks in 1775 and later wrote the memoirs of Gray. The latter was done\r\nin the gossiping style, imitated later by Boswell when he wrote the\r\n_Life of Samuel Johnson_. Mason wrote four volumes of poetry and won\r\nrecognition from Johnson as one of the British poets.\r\n\r\nThe present hymn, by which the author is best remembered, is found at\r\nthe end of Volume I of the _Works of William Mason, M. A., Precentor of\r\nYork and Rector of Aston_, 1811.\r\n\r\nOur author is not to be confused with his contemporary of the same name,\r\n1719-91, who succeeded Toplady in the editorship of _The Gospel\r\nMagazine_ and who was also a minister and hymn writer.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ELLERS. For comments on this tune and its composer, Edward J.\r\nHopkins, see Hymn 43.\r\n\r\n\r\n287. This is the day of light                   _John Ellerton_, 1826-93\r\n\r\nA worshipful Sabbath day hymn, breathing the spirit of rest, light, and\r\npeace, written in 1867.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, John Ellerton, see Hymn 43.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FRANCONIA. For comments on this tune see Hymn 205.\r\n\r\n\r\n288. Break Thou the bread of life          _Mary A. Lathbury_, 1841-1913\r\n\r\nThis gem, entitled, “Study Song,” was written for the Chautauqua\r\nLiterary and Scientific Circle and for Bible Study groups, but it also\r\nhas a wider use. Dr. G. Campbell Morgan used this hymn every Sunday for\r\nmany years immediately before the sermon. It is not a communion hymn\r\nalthough it is often used for that purpose. The breaking of bread refers\r\nto the feeding of the multitude beside the Sea of Galilee and not to the\r\nLast Supper; and the “bread of life” is the teaching of Jesus.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Mary Lathbury see Hymn 31.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BREAD OF LIFE is a popular American tune, sincere and simple in\r\nstyle, written for this hymn and indissolubly associated with it.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, William F. Sherwin, see Hymn 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE HOLY SCRIPTURES\r\n\r\n\r\n289. O Word of God Incarnate                        _W. W. How_, 1823-97\r\n\r\nA hymn addressed to Christ, the Word of God Incarnate, setting forth in\r\na succession of beautiful figures—a lantern, the golden casket, a\r\nbanner, a beam, chart and compass—the value of the written word, and the\r\nduty of the Church to carry the light of God’s word, both as incarnate\r\nand written, to the nations. It was written in 1867, headed by the text\r\nProv. 6:23: “For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and\r\nreproofs of instruction are the way of life.” The author himself was a\r\nliving witness to the power of the Word. His definition of a minister\r\nshows the high ideal he had of the preacher of the Word, and,\r\nincidentally, is an accurate description of his own life:\r\n\r\n  A man pure, holy, and spotless in his life; a man of much prayer; in\r\n  character meek, lowly, and infinitely compassionate; of tenderest love\r\n  to all; full of sympathy for every pain and sorrow, and devoting his\r\n  days and nights to lightening the burdens of humanity; utterly patient\r\n  of insult and enmity; utterly fearless in speaking the truth and\r\n  rebuking sin; ever ready to answer every call, to go wherever bidden\r\n  in order to do good; wholly without thought of self; making himself\r\n  the servant of all; patient, gentle, and untiring in dealing with the\r\n  souls he would save; bearing with ignorance, wilfulness, slowness,\r\n  cowardice in those of whom he expects most; sacrificing all, even life\r\n  itself, if need be, to save some.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on W. W. How, see Hymn 144.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MUNICH, “one of the most beautiful and perfectly constructed of\r\ntunes,” is of German origin and is known in Germany as “Königsberg\r\nChoral.” It appeared first in _Lobsingende Harffe_, 1682. The composer\r\nis unknown. Mendelssohn used the tune as the basis for his fine chorale,\r\n“Cast thy burden on the Lord,” in his oratorio, _Elijah_.\r\n\r\n\r\n290. Thy Word is like a garden, Lord           _Edwin Hodder_, 1837-1904\r\n\r\nThe metaphors used in this hymn to describe the Word of God are very\r\nsuggestive: “a garden,” “a deep, deep mine,” “a starry host.”\r\n\r\nEdwin Hodder was born in England but migrated at 19 years of age to New\r\nZealand where he was one of a pioneer group of idealists who introduced\r\nprogressive sociological ideas for which that country is noted. He\r\nreturned to England where he was engaged in the civil service from 1861\r\nuntil his retirement in 1897. Hodder wrote biographies and devotional\r\nworks, and in 1863 issued _The New Sunday School Hymn Book_ which\r\ncontained twenty-seven of his own hymns, including this one.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FOREST GREEN is an arrangement of an English folk song called,\r\n“The Ploughboy’s Dream.” R. Vaughan Williams, 1872-, who arranged the\r\ntune is England’s leading living composer. He has collected and edited\r\nfor publication many folksongs and carols, written several symphonies\r\nfor the orchestra, and has composed numerous choral works.\r\n\r\nSome good hymnals use this tune as the setting for Phillips Brooks’\r\npopular Christmas carol, “O little town of Bethlehem.”\r\n\r\n\r\n291. The heavens declare Thy glory, Lord        _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nHere is an unusual rendering of Psalm 19, which Watts entitled, “The\r\nBooks of Nature and of Scripture.” In the Psalm itself we find the Book\r\nof Nature in the first half and the Book of Scripture in the second half\r\nof the psalm. Instead of following this order, Watts sets the one over\r\nin couplets against the other, so that the first two lines of each\r\nstanza have to do with nature, the last two with Scripture.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts, see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ UXBRIDGE. This tune is by the American composer and teacher of\r\nmusic, Lowell Mason. The psalm tune “Burford” (228) is also named\r\n“Uxbridge” in some books.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Mason see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n292. Lord, Thy word abideth                    _Henry W. Baker_, 1821-77\r\n\r\nA hymn on the Scriptures, written for _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, 1861.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Henry W. Baker see Hymn 143.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ RAVENSHAW is from _Ein Neu Gesangbüchlein_, 1531, the earliest\r\nGerman hymn book of the Bohemian Brethren, edited by Michael Weisse. The\r\nmelody is older and was associated with a Latin hymn, _Ave Hierarchia,\r\ncoelestis et pia_. The present arrangement is by William H. Monk. For\r\ncomments on Monk see Hymn 40.\r\n\r\nFor a note on the Bohemian Brethren and Michael Weisse see Hymn 544.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE MINISTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n293. Shine Thou upon us, Lord                   _John Ellerton_, 1826-93\r\n\r\nA hymn for teachers.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Ellerton, see Hymn 42.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BROUGHTON. For comments on the composer of this melody, Thomas\r\nHastings, see Hymn 120.\r\n\r\n\r\n294. O still in accents sweet and strong    _Samuel Longfellow_, 1819-92\r\n\r\nThe author’s title of this hymn is, “Behold the Fields are White.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Samuel Longfellow see Hymn 28.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BELMONT. For comments on this tune see Hymn 197.\r\n\r\n\r\n295. Pour out Thy Spirit from on high      _James Montgomery_, 1771-1854\r\n\r\nWritten in 1833 for the Rev. J. Birchell, clergyman in the Church of\r\nEngland, who published it in his _Selection of Hymns_. It was printed in\r\nthe same year in Edward Bickersteth’s _Christian Psalmody_. For comments\r\non Bickersteth see Hymn 256. The hymn’s original title was, “For a\r\nMeeting of Clergy.” It is not intended to be sung by a body of people as\r\na prayer for ministers but as a prayer hymn to be sung by ministers\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nFor comments on James Montgomery see Hymn 62.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MELCOMBE. For comments on this tune see Hymn 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n296. Lord, speak to me, that I may speak          _Frances R. Havergal_,\r\n                                                                 1836-79\r\n\r\n“A Worker’s Prayer” is Miss Havergal’s title of this hymn and the text\r\nassociated with it is Rom. 14:7: “None of us liveth to himself and no\r\none dieth to himself.” It was composed April 28, 1872, at Winterdyne.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Frances Havergal see Hymn 126.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CANONBURY, a favorite tune found in nearly all hymn books, is\r\nfrom Robert Schumann’s _Nachtstücke_, Op. 23.\r\n\r\nRobert Schumann, 1810-56, greatest of the early German Romantics, was\r\nborn in Zwickau, Saxony. He wrote symphonies and chamber music but is\r\nknown best for his amazingly fine piano works and songs. His wife, Clara\r\nWieck Schumann, one of the greatest piano players the world has\r\nproduced, was devoted to him, as were also his children. Schumann became\r\nmentally ill, attempted unsuccessfully to drown himself in the Rhine,\r\nand was cared for in a hospital for two years before his death. He had a\r\ngift for journalism and wrote books and magazine articles on music.\r\n\r\n\r\n297. Thou who Thyself didst sanctify            _George Rawson_, 1807-89\r\n\r\nAn appropriate hymn for use in ordination to the Christian ministry or\r\ndedication to other forms of Christian service.\r\n\r\nGeorge Rawson, an English Congregational layman, was born at Leeds where\r\nhe practiced law many years. He had a considerable knowledge of music\r\nand was a gifted hymn writer. He rendered valuable assistance to his own\r\ndenomination as well as to the Baptists in the preparation of hymn books\r\nfor use in the church. A shy, retiring man, of sincere piety, he at\r\nfirst published his hymns, a considerable collection, anonymously, but\r\nlater had to acknowledge his identity. About 50 of his hymns are still\r\nin use.\r\n\r\n(The name is misspelled “Dawson” in the Hymnary.)\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DUNDEE (or FRENCH) is one of the twelve Common Tunes appearing\r\nin the _Scottish Psalter_, _The CL Psalms of David, &_, Edinburgh, 1615,\r\nwhere it is named “French Tune.” Its first appearance in an English\r\nPsalter is in Ravencroft’s _Whole Book of Psalms_, 1621, where it is\r\ncalled “Dundy.” It is one of the best known of the psalm tunes and its\r\nsmooth, flowing melody has enjoyed great popularity.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the _Scottish Psalter_ see Hymn 575.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CONSECRATION OF CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\n298. Gracious Savior, gentle Shepherd     _Jane Eliza Leeson_, 1807-1882\r\n                                                 _John Keble_, 1792-1866\r\n\r\nA hymn for the children’s consecration service, evolved by John Keble\r\nfrom three hymns—“Shepherd in thy bosom, folded,” “Loving Shepherd of\r\nThy sheep” (429), and “Infant sorrow, infant weakness,” written by Jane\r\nEliza Leeson. Keble took the main ideas of these hymns and rewrote them\r\ninto a hymn of five stanzas, two of which are omitted here.\r\n\r\nJane Eliza Leeson was born in London and died there. She had rare gifts\r\nin writing for children, and published several books of hymns—_Infant\r\nHymnings_, and _Hymns and Scenes of Childhood_—specially for children.\r\nVery little is known of her life, except that she was a prominent figure\r\nin the Catholic Apostolic Church and that some of her hymns were\r\nsupposedly “prophetical utterances,” prompted by the Holy Spirit, at\r\npublic services, which she “delivered slowly with short pauses between\r\nthe verses.” Late in life she united with the Roman Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Keble, see Hymn 22.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MANNHEIM is from the source mentioned in the note on Hymn 174.\r\nThe present form of the melody is much altered from the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n299. All hidden lie the future ways     _Frederick L. Hosmer_, 1840-1929\r\n\r\nA lyrical phrasing of the emotions that arise in the hearts of parents\r\nas they contemplate the faring forth of little children into the hidden\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Frederick L. Hosmer, see Hymn 72.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NUN SICH DER TAG GEENDET HAT is a tune set to various hymns in\r\nthe _Gesangbuch mit Noten_.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Aaron Williams, see Hymn 269.\r\n\r\n\r\n300. A little child the Savior came         _William Robertson_, 1820-64\r\n\r\nA Scotch Presbyterian minister, William Robertson, contributed this hymn\r\nto the Church of Scotland’s _Hymns for Public Worship_ in 1861. The\r\nauthor, keenly interested in hymnody and Scotch psalmody, was a member\r\nof the Hymnal Committee of the Church of Scotland in 1851, 1853, and\r\n1857.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ALSTONE was composed by C. E. Willing, 1830-1904, for the\r\nchildren’s hymn, “We are but little children weak,” in _Hymns Ancient\r\nand Modern_, Appendix, 1868. Willing was chorister of Westminster Abbey\r\nand held various responsible positions as organist and choral conductor\r\nin England.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BAPTISM\r\n\r\n\r\n301. Come, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost         _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nThe original poem of six stanzas is from _Hymns and Sacred Poems_, 1749,\r\nwhere it was entitled, “At the Baptism of Adults.”\r\n\r\nWesley’s second line of the first stanza read\r\n\r\n  “Honor the means injoin’d by Thee,”\r\n\r\nwhich was changed to “ordained by Thee” for the _Collection_ of 1780.\r\nThe awkward expression, “Effectuate now the sacred sign,” Wesley’s\r\nsecond line of stanza 3, was changed to “Effectual make the sacred\r\nsign,” by the editors of the hymn book in 1849.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SO LANGE JESUS BLEIBT DER HERR is a familiar melody, of unknown\r\norigin, from the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_.\r\n\r\n\r\n302. I’m not ashamed to own my Lord             _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nThis hymn is based on II Timothy 1:8-12.\r\n\r\nJames Moffatt writes that when Henry Drummond was on his death bed, Nov.\r\n7, 1897, his friend, Dr. Hugh Barbour, played several hymn tunes to him\r\nwithout gaining any response. Then he tried the Old Scots melody of\r\n“Martyrdom” to which Drummond beat time with his hand and joined in the\r\nwords, “I’m not ashamed to own my Lord.” When the hymn was done, he\r\nsaid, “There’s nothing to beat that, Hugh.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DEDHAM. The tune is attributed to William Gardiner, 1770-1853,\r\nan Englishman of whom nothing much of importance is known except that he\r\npublished _Sacred Melodies_ in 1812, a collection of excellent tunes,\r\nwhich was expanded to six volumes published in 1815.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE LORD’S SUPPER\r\n\r\n\r\n303. Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face          _Horatius Bonar_,\r\n                                                                 1808-89\r\n\r\nEntitled by the author, “This Do in Remembrance of Me.”\r\n\r\nIt is a famous communion hymn, emphasizing, in keeping with the Reformed\r\ntradition, the thought that Christ Himself presides at His Table. All\r\nHis followers are therefore welcome.\r\n\r\nThree members of the Bonar family became eminent ministers in the Free\r\nChurch of Scotland (Presbyterian)—Andrew in Glasgow; John in Greenock;\r\nand Horatius in Edinburgh. Horatius was accustomed to visit his brother\r\nJohn once a year at the communion service. Hymns were still not\r\npermitted to be sung in the church, but an original poem was invariably\r\nread after the communion. This hymn was written by Horatius Bonar at the\r\nrequest of his brother John for the occasion of such a visit in October,\r\n1855. It has become a widely used communion hymn in all churches.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Horatius Bonar see Hymn 129.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LANGRAN, known in England as “St. Agnes,” is named after the\r\ncomposer, James Langran, 1835-1909, London organist and composer, who\r\nwrote this music for “Abide with me” (40). It was published separately\r\nin 1861 and two years later appeared in _Psalms and Hymns adapted to the\r\nservices of the Church of England, with accompanying tunes selected and\r\nrevised by John Foster_.\r\n\r\nThe hymn is also sung to “Ellers” (See 43 or 286).\r\n\r\n\r\n304. Bread of the world, in mercy broken     _Reginald Heber_, 1783-1826\r\n\r\n“A quiet communion hymn full of loveliness and warm reality of\r\nfaith.”—Reeves.\r\n\r\nThis popular communion hymn by Bishop Heber was published posthumously\r\nwith the title, “Before the Sacrifice.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Reginald Heber see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EUCHARISTIC HYMN, a tune “beautiful in its simplicity,” has\r\nalways been associated with this hymn by Heber. The composer, John\r\nSebastian Bach Hodges, 1830-1915, son of the illustrious organist,\r\nEdward Hodges, was born in Bristol, England, but came to America when\r\neight years old. He received his education at Columbia University and\r\nGeneral Theological Seminary, New York City, and became a noted minister\r\nin the Protestant Episcopal Church. He had excellent musical knowledge\r\nand founded in Baltimore the earliest choir school in the United States.\r\nHe also did much work on the various revisions of the Episcopal hymnal.\r\n\r\n\r\n305. According to Thy gracious word        _James Montgomery_, 1771-1854\r\n\r\nOne of the best-loved and most useful of communion hymns, profound, yet\r\nsimple. It appeared first in Montgomery’s _Christian Psalmist_, 1825,\r\nand has since passed into the hymn books of all denominations of\r\nevangelical Christians. The words of Luke 22:19 furnish the scriptural\r\nbasis of the hymn: “This do in remembrance of me.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on James Montgomery see Hymn 62.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. JOHN, more properly called “St. John’s, Westminster,” was\r\ncomposed by James Turle, 1802-82.\r\n\r\nFor comments on James Turle see Hymn 283.\r\n\r\n\r\n306. Bread of the world, in mercy broken     _Reginald Heber_, 1783-1826\r\n\r\nThe _Church Hymnary_, London, 1927, has the following practical note at\r\nthe bottom of the page where this hymn appears:\r\n\r\n  As this hymn consists of one verse only, it is suggested that it be\r\n  sung twice over: once by the choir alone, and again by choir and\r\n  people in unison. It may also be used as a short motet for\r\n  unaccompanied singing by the choir.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on this hymn see No. 304.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ RENDEZ À DIEU was composed or adapted by L. Bourgeois for the\r\n_French Genevan Psalter_, where it was set to Psalm 118. In the\r\n_Scottish Psalter_ of 1564, the tune was again used to John Craig’s\r\nversion of the same Psalm. It is described in _Songs of Praise\r\nDiscussed_ as being “in some ways the finest of all the early psalm\r\ntunes ... perfectly proportioned ... a tune which gives the true ‘spinal\r\nthrill’; of its kind it is unsurpassed.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on L. Bourgeois see Hymn 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n307. Come, risen Lord, and deign to be our guest     _George W. Briggs_,\r\n                                                                   1875—\r\n\r\nBased on the account of the supper at Emmaus, Luke 24:28-31:\r\n\r\n  And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as\r\n  though he would have gone further. But they constrained him saying,\r\n  Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And\r\n  he went in to tarry with them. And it came to pass, as he sat at meat\r\n  with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.\r\n  And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of\r\n  their sight.\r\n\r\nIt stresses the doctrine that Christ Himself is the celebrant at the\r\nLord’s Supper.\r\n\r\nGeorge Wallace Briggs is a Cambridge scholar, an outstanding preacher,\r\neducator, writer, and editor in the Anglican church. He has composed a\r\nnumber of hymns (See 570) and hymn tunes.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BIRMINGHAM is from F. Cunningham’s _A Selection of Psalm\r\nTunes_, 2d ed., 1834, where it is set to the words, “Come, gracious\r\nSpirit, heavenly dove.” Cunningham published an earlier collection of\r\npsalm tunes in 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\n308. I hunger and I thirst                 _John S. B. Monsell,_ 1811-75\r\n\r\nA simple, tender, communion hymn which ought to have a wider use.\r\n\r\nJohn Samuel Bewley Monsell was educated at Trinity College, Dublin;\r\nlabored for a number of years in the church in Ireland; and then became\r\nvicar of Egham in the Diocese of Worcester, England, and finally rector\r\nof St. Nicholas, Guildford. His home life at Guildford is described as\r\nhaving been “full of the beauty of holiness, with genial brightness and\r\ngaity playing like sunshine over all the troubles of life.” His life\r\ncame to a tragic end when he fell from the roof of the church while it\r\nwas being rebuilt. He composed about 300 hymns and is the author of many\r\nother poetic works.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MAINZ (MARIA JUNG UND ZART) originally appeared in a Catholic\r\nbook, _Ausserlesene Catholische, Geistliche Kirchengesänge von\r\nPfingsten, biss zum Advent_, Cologne, 1632. It was slightly changed and\r\nprinted in its present form in _Psalteriolum Harmonicum Sacrarum\r\nCantilenarum_, 1642.\r\n\r\n\r\n309. Author of life divine                     _Charles Wesley,_ 1707-88\r\n\r\nThis fine communion hymn is from _Hymns on the Lord’s Supper_, 1745, by\r\nJohn and Charles Wesley. It is attributed in many hymnals to Charles,\r\nbut there is no conclusive evidence to show which of the two brothers\r\nwrote it. The thought of the hymn is said to be in full accord with\r\nJohn’s teaching concerning the Holy Communion.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WESLEY. The original source of this tune has not been traced.\r\nIn the _English Hymnal_ it is set to the words, “Behold a little child.”\r\nThe tune should not be confused with Lowell Mason’s of the same name\r\n(See 332).\r\n\r\n\r\n310. By Christ redeemed, in Christ restored     _George Rawson_, 1807-89\r\n\r\nWritten in 1857 and published first in a Baptist book, _Psalms and\r\nHymns_, 1858.\r\n\r\nJulian comments: “It is a hymn of more than usual excellence and has\r\nattained to a greater position in modern hymnals than any other of the\r\nauthor’s numerous compositions.”\r\n\r\nThe refrain, “Until He come,” is reminiscent of I Cor. 11:26: “For as\r\noft as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do shew forth the Lord’s\r\ndeath, till he come.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on George Rawson see Hymn 297.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ IN MEMORIAM. For comments on the composer of this tune,\r\nFrederick Charles Maker, 1844-1927, see Hymn 112.\r\n\r\n\r\n311. Bread of heaven, on Thee we feed         _Josiah Conder_, 1789-1855\r\n\r\nThe hymn appeared in the author’s _Star of the East_, 1821, as “Bread of\r\nheaven, on Thee I feed.” The first person singular was altered to the\r\nplural throughout, and other changes made, improving the original.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Josiah Conder see Hymn 247.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ALETTA is by the American composer of popular church and Sunday\r\nschool music, William B. Bradbury, 1816-68. For further comments on\r\nBradbury see Hymn 103.\r\n\r\nConder’s hymn may also be sung to “_Nicht so traurig_” (538).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n312. O perfect Love, all human thought transcending             _Dorothy\r\n                                            Blomfield Gurney_, 1858-1932\r\n                              _Doxology added by John Ellerton_, 1826-93\r\n\r\nA singularly appropriate hymn for a Christian wedding. The author,\r\nDorothy Gurney, born near London in 1858, was the daughter of Rev.\r\nFrederick Blomfield, a minister of the Anglican Church. She married a\r\nminister’s son, Gerald Gurney, and with her husband, united with the\r\nRoman Catholic Church in 1919. Mrs. Gurney has given the following\r\naccount of the writing of this popular hymn for holy matrimony:\r\n\r\n  We were all singing hymns one Sunday evening and had just finished “O\r\n  Strength and Stay,” the tune to which was an especial favorite of my\r\n  sister’s, when someone remarked what a pity it was that the words\r\n  should be unsuitable for a wedding. My sister, turning suddenly to me,\r\n  said: “What is the use of a sister who composes poetry if she cannot\r\n  write me new words to this tune?” I picked up a hymn-book and said:\r\n  “Well, if no one will disturb me, I will go into the library and see\r\n  what I can do.” After about fifteen minutes I came back with the hymn,\r\n  “O perfect Love,” and there and then we all sang it to the tune of\r\n  “Strength and Stay.” It went perfectly, and my sister was delighted,\r\n  saying that it must be sung at her wedding. For two or three years it\r\n  was sung privately at many London weddings, and then it found its way\r\n  into the hymnals. The writing of it was no effort whatever after the\r\n  initial idea had come to me of the twofold aspect of perfect union,\r\n  love and life; and I have always felt that God helped me to write it.\r\n\r\nIt is the most popular wedding hymn extant.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Ellerton, who added the third stanza, see Hymn 42.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PERFECT LOVE is from an anthem composed by Joseph Barnby for\r\nthe marriage of Princess Louise of Wales to the Duke of Fife, July 27,\r\n1889. The anthem has been sung at many subsequent royal weddings.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Joseph Barnby see Hymn 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BURIAL OF THE DEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n313. Safe in the arms of Jesus              _Fanny J. Crosby_, 1820-1915\r\n\r\nWritten April 30, 1868, at the request of W. H. Doane, composer of the\r\ntune to which it was to be sung. The hymn and tune were published first\r\nin _Songs of Devotion for Christian Associations_, 1870. It is a tender\r\nlyric which has given peace and satisfaction to many who have faced\r\ndeath and especially to mothers who have lost children.\r\n\r\nFanny Crosby, born in Putnam County, N. Y., became blind when six weeks\r\nold as the result of an application of a warm poultice to her eyes. She\r\nwas educated in the New York (City) Institute for the Blind and there\r\nserved as a teacher for a time. In 1858, she was married to Alexander\r\nvan Alstyne, a blind musician. Miss Crosby began writing verses when a\r\nchild of eight years and throughout her long life showed a marvelous\r\nfacility for expression in poetry, which resulted in the writing of\r\nnearly 6,000 hymns besides many secular poems. Many of her hymns were\r\nwritten for W. H. Doane, Robert Lowry, Philip Phillips, Ira Sankey, and\r\nothers who were editors of evangelistic song books. She is best known by\r\nher maiden name but also wrote under her married name and 216 _noms de\r\nplume_. She was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Ten of her\r\nhymns are in the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SAFE IN THE ARMS, also known as “Refuge,” was composed by\r\nWilliam Howard Doane, 1832-1916, a manufacturer of wood-working\r\nmachinery in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was a member of the Baptist Church and\r\nserved many years as superintendent of the Sunday school in his church.\r\nA music enthusiast, he published 35 collections of song books and\r\ncomposed numerous hymn tunes, anthems, and cantatas. In 1875, Denison\r\nUniversity, Granville, Ohio, conferred on him the degree of Doctor of\r\nMusic.\r\n\r\n\r\n314. Asleep in Jesus....                      _Margaret Mackay_, 1802-87\r\n\r\nWritten by Margaret Mackay, wife of a distinguished officer in the\r\nEnglish army. She composed numerous hymns and poems, but none is so\r\nwidely known as this tender lyric so often used as a funeral hymn, which\r\nshe entitled, “Burial of the Dead.” The hymn was suggested by an\r\ninscription she saw on a tombstone in the burying ground of Pennycross\r\nChapel, a rural spot in Devonshire:\r\n\r\n  “Sleeping in Jesus.”\r\n\r\nOne stanza, the fifth, has been omitted. It reads:\r\n\r\n  Asleep in Jesus: time nor space\r\n  Debars this precious “hiding place.”\r\n  On Indian plains or Lapland snows\r\n  Believers find the same repose.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was first published in _The Amethyst_, 1832, in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ REST. For comments on the composer, William B. Bradbury, see\r\nHymn 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n315. Now the laborer’s task is o’er             _John Ellerton_, 1826-93\r\n\r\nWritten for _Church Hymns_, 1871, by John Ellerton, distinguished\r\nhymnist of the Church of England. His biographer has written concerning\r\nthis hymn:\r\n\r\n  We now come to the loveliest and most loved of Mr. Ellerton’s hymns.\r\n  It has been sung and will continue to be sung at the graveside of\r\n  princes, divines, statesmen, poets, artists, authors, as well as many\r\n  a Christian labourer of humble life.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Ellerton see Hymn 42.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ REQUIESCAT was written for this hymn. It appeared first in\r\n_Hymns Ancient and Modern_, 1875. For comments on the composer, John B.\r\nDykes, see Hymn 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n316. O Lord of life, where’er they be   _Frederick L. Hosmer_, 1840-1929\r\n\r\nThis hymn, a source of comfort and courage to many mourners, was\r\ncomposed by Hosmer in 1888 for the Easter service in his own church in\r\nCleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe note of triumph runs throughout the hymn, each stanza ending with a\r\njubilant “Allelujah.” It was written to be sung with Palestrina’s tune,\r\n“Victory.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Frederick Hosmer see Hymn 72.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ VICTORY. For comments on this tune see Hymn 116.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BURIAL OF THE DEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n317. For all the saints                        _William W. How_, 1823-97\r\n\r\nThe original, in eleven stanzas, was published in 1864 in _Hymns for\r\nSaints’ Days_, by a layman, Lord Nelson. One of the omitted stanzas\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n  For the Apostles’ glorious company\r\n  Who, bearing forth the Cross o’er land and sea,\r\n  Shook all the mighty world, we sing to Thee.\r\n\r\nFor comments on William How see Hymn 144.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SARUM. The tune was composed for the _Sarum Hymnal_, 1869, for\r\nthese words by Bishop How. It is also known as “St. Philip” and “For All\r\nthe Saints.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Joseph Barnby, see Hymn 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n318. We cannot think of them as dead    _Frederick L. Hosmer_, 1840-1929\r\n\r\nWritten in 1876 after the death by drowning of a young member of the\r\nchurch of which the author was minister.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Frederick L. Hosmer, see Hymn 72.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. FLAVIAN is from the _English Psalter_ of 1562 which was\r\nprinted by John Day in London. The present is the first half, with some\r\nalterations, of the tune set to Psalm 132.\r\n\r\n\r\n319. Come, let us join our friends above       _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nThe first of a group of _Funeral Hymns_, published in 1759. It sets\r\nforth the assurance that friends gone before are not lost to those who\r\nmourn,\r\n\r\n  For all the servants of the King\r\n    In earth and heaven are one.\r\n\r\nThis hymn, one of Wesley’s greatest, has had wide use throughout the\r\nEnglish speaking world in times of sorrow and loss of loved ones. It is\r\nan exposition of the words of the ancient Creed, “I believe in the\r\ncommunion of saints.”\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth verses, containing the idea of One Church, are\r\namong the finest in the whole range of hymnody.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was a great favorite of John Wesley. It so happened that he\r\ngave it out to be sung at a service he was conducting, at the very hour\r\nof the death of his brother Charles, giving the hymn a peculiarly\r\npathetic interest.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DUNDEE. For comments on this tune see Hymn 297.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHURCH UNITY\r\n\r\n\r\n320. In Christ there is no East or West        _John Oxenham_, 1852-1941\r\n\r\nA poem of human brotherhood, carrying a fine missionary message much\r\nneeded in our day. It is written in the spirit of St. Paul—“where there\r\nis neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian,\r\nScythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all and in all,” Col. 3:11. It\r\nstands in striking contrast to Kipling’s more narrow nationalism in his\r\n“East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.”\r\n\r\nThis hymn which has now found its way into most modern hymn books was\r\nwritten for a missionary pageant, _The Pageant of Darkness and Light_,\r\nwhich the London Missionary Society asked the author to write, for use\r\nin connection with a great missionary exhibition in London, an affair\r\nwhich ran for a month and did much to stimulate interest in missions in\r\nall the churches. Oxenham wrote the _libretto_ and planned the scenes\r\nfor the pageant. The composer of the music, Hamish MacCunn, sent to him\r\nin a hurry one day for a few verses to fill in a gap. To this request\r\nOxenham responded with the beautiful, simple lines, “No East or West.”\r\n\r\nJohn Oxenham, English publisher, poet, and novelist, was born in\r\nManchester. He wrote this poem in 1908; and in 1939 sent the hymn,\r\n“Peace in our time” (357) with a personal letter to the editors of the\r\n_Hymnary_. The name John Oxenham is a _nom de plume_ for William Arthur\r\nDunkerley. For some years Dunkerley was engaged in business, in the\r\ninterest of which he travelled extensively in Europe and Canada, and\r\nlived in France and the United States. He once investigated the\r\npossibilities of cotton growing and sheep raising in the Southern States\r\nbut decided against the venture. He began writing as a relief from\r\nbusiness, and then, later, dropped business in favor of writing.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. PETER, also known as “St. Peter’s, Oxford,” was composed\r\nfor Psalm 118, by Alexander R. Reinagle, 1799-1877, distinguished\r\norganist for thirty-one years in St. Peter’s-in-the-East Church, Oxford.\r\nThe tune derives its name from the church which the composer served so\r\nlong. It appeared in _Psalm Tunes for the Voice and the Pianoforte_,\r\npublished by Reinagle in 1830. It is a majestic tune and should be sung\r\nin moderate time with strong rhythmic accent.\r\n\r\n\r\n321. Jesus, Lord, we look to Thee              _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nFour simple, lovely stanzas setting forth the unity of believers in\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MÜDE BIN ICH, GEH ZUR RUH. For comments on this tune see Hymn\r\n254.\r\n\r\n\r\n322. All praise to our redeeming Lord          _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nA favorite and appropriate hymn for use at religious reunions and\r\nconference gatherings. Wesley entitled it, “At meeting of Friends.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ARMENIA was composed by Sylvanus Billings Pond, 1792-1871,\r\nAlbany, N. Y., a piano manufacturer. Billings wrote many fine tunes and\r\nin 1841 issued the _United States Psalmody_, in which this tune\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n323. How sweet, how heavenly is the sight        _Joseph Swain_, 1761-96\r\n\r\nA beautiful hymn of Christian love, suggesting lines by Alice Carey:\r\n\r\n  He who loves best his fellowman\r\n    Is loving God the holiest way he can.\r\n\r\nIt appeared in the author’s _Walworth Hymns_, 1792, entitled, “The Grace\r\nof Christian Love.”\r\n\r\nJoseph Swain, English Baptist minister and hymn writer, lost his parents\r\nearly in life and was apprenticed to an engraver. He led a careless,\r\nfrivolous life until his conversion at the age of twenty-two, when he\r\nbecame a fervent Christian. He qualified for the Baptist ministry and\r\nbegan serving as minister of a congregation in East Street, Walworth, in\r\n1791. His poetic gifts, formerly given worldly and superficial\r\nexpression, were now turned with great effect to his evangelistic\r\nappeals. His short ministry of five years, cut off by a lamented early\r\ndeath, was very successful.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ REMEMBER ME. For comments on Asa Hull, composer of the tune,\r\nsee Hymn 232.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MISSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n324. The morning light is breaking            _Samuel F. Smith_, 1808-95\r\n\r\nA great missionary hymn, though a little too optimistic. It was written\r\nin 1832 while the author was a student in Andover Theological Seminary.\r\nAfter reading an inspiring account by Adoniram Judson of his great\r\nmissionary work in Burma, Smith put his enthusiasm for missions into\r\nthese verses, now sung in all the churches.\r\n\r\nRev. Samuel F. Smith, Harvard graduate in the class with Oliver Wendell\r\nHolmes, became the foremost American Baptist hymn writer of the 19th\r\ncentury. He is the author of numerous hymns but is best known by “My\r\ncountry, ’tis of thee” and the present hymn. His desire to be a\r\nmissionary himself was never fulfilled, but his son volunteered for the\r\nservice and became the successor to Judson in the great work in Burma.\r\n“The morning light is breaking” has been translated into many tongues.\r\nIn a letter dated March 17, 1883, the author said of this hymn: “I have\r\nheard versions of it sung in Karen, Burman, Italian, Spanish,\r\nPortuguese, Swedish, German, and Telegu.” Dr. Smith was a great\r\nlinguist. He taught modern languages for a time in Colby College and had\r\na familiarity with no less than fifteen languages. It is said that at\r\nthe age of 86 he was seeking a suitable textbook to use in the study of\r\nthe Russian language. He served as minister of Baptist churches at\r\nWaterville, Me., and Newton Center, Mass., and was secretary of the\r\nBaptist Missionary Union for 15 years.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WEBB. For comments on this tune and its composer, George J.\r\nWebb, see Hymn 65.\r\n\r\n\r\n325. Far and near the fields are teeming                _J. O. Thompson_\r\n\r\nA popular missionary hymn based on Luke 10:2: “The harvest truly is\r\ngreat, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the\r\nharvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.”\r\n\r\nNo information has been found concerning the author, J. O. Thompson, or\r\nthe composer of the tune, J. B. O. Clemm. The song appeared in _The\r\nEpworth Hymnal_, edited by John H. Vincent, afterward a Bishop, and\r\npublished by Phillips and Hunt, Methodist Publishers, New York, in 1885.\r\nIt was copyrighted by them as of that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n326. Father, whose will is life and good             _Hardwicke Drummond\r\n                                                    Rawnsley_, 1851-1920\r\n\r\nA prayer for the sick, and for physicians engaged in medical missionary\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe hymn first appeared in _A Missionary Hymn Book_, 1922, published by\r\nthe Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, in London. The\r\nauthor, Rev. Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley, was an influential minister\r\nand educator in the Church of England. He spent much of his life in the\r\nLake District in northern England, and, being a man of public spirit and\r\na lover of nature, he championed the rights of the people in securing\r\nfor public use in perpetuity many beautiful tracts of the Lake District\r\nand other parts of the country. His friends remembered him as one “who,\r\ngreatly loving the fair things of nature and of art, set all his love to\r\nthe service of God and man.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ “TALLIS,” says William H. Havergal in _Notes on Certain Tunes_,\r\nis “simplicity itself. A child may sing the tune, while manly genius\r\nwill admire it.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Thomas Tallis, see Hymn 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n327. Christ for the world we sing              _Samuel Wolcott_, 1813-86\r\n\r\nThe author of this hymn, Samuel Wolcott, born at South Windsor, Conn.,\r\ngraduated from Yale at 20, spent two years in Syria as a missionary, and\r\nthen, on account of failing health, returned to the United States where\r\nhe served as pastor in various Congregational churches. The hymn was\r\nsuggested to him by a motto, “Christ for the World and the World for\r\nChrist,” made from branches of evergreen, in a Cleveland church where a\r\nY.M.C.A. convention was held. One night, walking home from the\r\nconvention to which he was a delegate, the words of the hymn took form.\r\nYankton College, South Dakota, has adopted it as the opening hymn for\r\neach term of school.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MALVERN. For comments on this tune and its composer, John\r\nRoberts, see Hymn 131.\r\n\r\n\r\n328. O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling       _Mary A. Thomson_,\r\n                                                               1834-1923\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest and most useful missionary hymns in the English\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nMary Ann Faulkner was born in London but came to this country as a girl\r\nand became the wife of John Thomson, Librarian of the Free Library, in\r\nPhiladelphia. A member of the Protestant Episcopal Church, her hymns,\r\nabout forty in all, were published in _The Churchman_, New York, and in\r\n_The Living Age_, Chicago.\r\n\r\nOf the origin of this missionary hymn, Mrs. Thomson has written:\r\n\r\n  I wrote the greater part of the hymn, “O Zion, haste,” in the year\r\n  1868. I had written many hymns before, and one night, while I was\r\n  sitting up with one of my children who was ill of typhoid fever, I\r\n  thought I should like to write a missionary hymn to the tune of the\r\n  hymn beginning, “Hark, hark, my soul, angelic songs are swelling,” as\r\n  I was fond of that tune; but as I could not then get a refrain I\r\n  liked, I left the hymn unfinished, and about three years later I\r\n  finished it by writing the refrain which now forms part of it. By some\r\n  mistake 1891 is given instead of 1871 as the date of the hymn in the\r\n  (Episcopal) _Hymnal_. I do not think it is ever sung to the tune for\r\n  which I wrote it. Rev. John Anketell told me, and I am sure he is\r\n  right, that it is better for a hymn to have a tune of its own, and I\r\n  feel much indebted to the composer of the tune TIDINGS for writing so\r\n  inspiring a tune to my words.\r\n\r\nShe was mistaken in the last sentence, for Walch’s tune, strangely\r\nenough, was composed for the words “Hark, hark my soul” (260).\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ TIDINGS was written, as stated above, for the hymn, “Hark, hark\r\nmy soul! Angelic songs are swelling” (260), by James Walch, 1837-1901,\r\nan English composer and organist. The tune was never accepted for that\r\nhymn, because there already were several good tunes for it in use. In\r\nthe providence of God, it found this hymn. The union was favored from\r\nthe beginning and continues so today.\r\n\r\n\r\n329. Word of Life, most pure, most strong       _Jonathan F. Bahnmaier_,\r\n                                                               1774-1841\r\n                                      _Tr. Catherine Winkworth_, 1829-78\r\n\r\nOne of the best and most useful hymns for foreign missions.\r\n\r\nThe original poem has six stanzas, our hymn comprising the last three,\r\ntranslated by Catherine Winkworth. The German text is found at No. 551,\r\nthe hymn there being a free translation by Percy Dearmer.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Catherine Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\nJonathan F. Bahnmaier was born at Oberstenfeld where his father, J. C.\r\nBahnmaier, was town preacher. He received his education at Tübingen and\r\nbecame assistant, in 1798, to his father. Later he had an appointment as\r\nProfessor of Education and Homiletics at Tübingen but resigned in 1819\r\nto become dean and town preacher at Kirchheim-unter-Teck, a post he held\r\nuntil his death. Bahnmaier was greatly interested in education,\r\nmissions, and Bible societies and was on the committee which compiled\r\nthe _Württemberg Gesangbuch_, published after his death in 1842. One\r\nother of his hymns, “_Jesu als du wiederkehrtest_,” entitled, “Prayer\r\nafter School,” has been translated into English.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MOZART is adapted from the “Kyrie” of the _Twelfth Mass_ by the\r\nfamous composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 1756-91.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Mozart see Hymn 179.\r\n\r\n\r\n330. O Spirit of the living God            _James Montgomery_, 1771-1854\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest missionary hymns in the English language. It was\r\ncomposed for a missionary service held in Leeds, England, June 4, 1823,\r\nand was entitled, “The Spirit Accompanying the Word of God.” Its lyric\r\nbeauty, its burning passion for the spread of the gospel, combined with\r\nits dignity and healthy-mindedness make it an extraordinarily useful\r\nhymn. Setting forth and emphasizing the relation of the Holy Spirit to\r\nthe work of missions, it fills an important place in the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\nFor comments on James Montgomery see Hymn 62.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ALSTONE. For comments on this tune see Hymn 300.\r\n\r\n\r\n331. Fling out the banner! let it float     _George W. Doane_, 1799-1859\r\n\r\nA stirring missionary hymn entitled, “Missions, Home and Foreign.”\r\n\r\nIt is based on Psalm 60:4: “Thou hast given a banner to them that fear\r\nthee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written in response to a request from the young women at\r\nSt. Mary’s Hall, Burlington, N. J., a girls’ college founded by Bishop\r\nDoane, to be sung at a flag raising. The author, writing what has become\r\na widely known hymn, gave the occasion a far wider significance than the\r\ngirls had foreseen.\r\n\r\nBishop George Doane, a zealous advocate of missions, was known in his\r\nown church as “the missionary bishop of America.” The modern missionary\r\nmovement arose and spread in his lifetime. The hymn reflects Doane’s\r\nenthusiasm and aggressive missionary leadership.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on the author see Hymn 36.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WALTHAM—also known as “Doane” and “Camden”—was written by John\r\nBaptiste Calkin, 1827-1905, English pianist and organist, professor of\r\nmusic, and composer of church music, both instrumental and vocal. The\r\ntune with its martial swing lends itself well for use as a processional.\r\n\r\n\r\n332. Hail to the brightness of Zion’s glad morning    _Thomas Hastings_,\r\n                                                               1784-1872\r\n\r\nA missionary hymn written in 1832, at the beginning of the modern\r\nmissionary movement. It was first published in _Spiritual Songs for\r\nSocial Worship_, 1833, a volume compiled jointly by Hastings and Mason,\r\nset to the present tune by Lowell Mason. _Spiritual Songs_ was a notable\r\nvolume, publishing for the first time such well-known hymns as “The\r\nmorning light is breaking,” “My faith looks up to Thee,” and introducing\r\nin America, Toplady’s famous “Rock of Ages.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Thomas Hastings see Hymn 120.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WESLEY, also called “Hail to the Brightness,” was written by\r\nLowell Mason for this hymn. It is a simple, straightforward melody,\r\nwhose merit as a hymn tune is unquestionable.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Lowell Mason see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n333. From Greenland’s icy mountains          _Reginald Heber_, 1783-1826\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous missionary hymns ever written. An interesting\r\nstory is attached to its origin, a detailed account of which was written\r\nby Thomas Edgeworth on the fly-leaf of a facsimile of the original\r\nmanuscript as follows:\r\n\r\n  On Whitsunday, 1819, the late Dr. Shipley, Dean of St. Asaph, and\r\n  Vicar of Wrexham, preached a sermon in Wrexham Church in aid of the\r\n  Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. That day\r\n  was also fixed upon for the commencement of the Sunday evening\r\n  lectures intended to be established in the church, and the late Bishop\r\n  of Calcutta (Heber), then rector of Hodnet, the Dean’s son-in-law\r\n  being together in the vicarage, the former requested Heber to write\r\n  “something for them to sing in the morning”; and he retired for that\r\n  purpose from the table where the Dean and a few friends were sitting\r\n  to a distant part of the room. In a short time the Dean enquired,\r\n  “What have you written?” Heber having then composed the three first\r\n  verses, read them over. “There, there, that will do very well,” said\r\n  the Dean. “No, no, the sense is not complete,” replied Heber.\r\n  Accordingly he added the fourth verse, and the Dean being inexorable\r\n  to his repeated request of “Let me add another; oh, let me add\r\n  another!” thus completed the hymn of which the annexed is a facsimile\r\n  and which has since become so celebrated. It was sung the next morning\r\n  in Wrexham Church the first time.\r\n\r\nThe tune to which it was sung was “’Twas when the seas were roaring,”\r\nfrom _The Beggar’s Opera_—a fine but somewhat incongruous selection.\r\n\r\nThe words of the hymn reflect the enthusiasm and zeal of consecrated\r\nyouth, eager, like Livingstone, to go out to a distant people needing\r\nhelp and to sacrifice life for the cause. Greatly interested in\r\nmissions, Heber was offered the Bishopric of Calcutta and accepted it\r\nagainst the advice of his friends. After three years of strenuous,\r\ndevoted labor, he was stricken with apoplexy and found dead in his bath\r\non the evening of a busy day in which he had baptized forty-two native\r\nconverts.\r\n\r\nThe much-discussed second stanza, omitted in the _Hymnary_ because of\r\nits seeming low estimate of man, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  What though the spicy breezes\r\n    Blow soft o’er Ceylon’s isle;\r\n  Though every prospect pleases\r\n    And only man is vile;\r\n  In vain with lavish kindness\r\n    The gifts of God are strown;\r\n  The heathen in his blindness\r\n    Bows down to wood and stone.\r\n\r\nThe hymn is widely used among German speaking people in the following\r\ntranslation made by Dr. Ch. G. Barth, 1799-1862:\r\n\r\n  Von Grönlands eis’gen Zinken,\r\n    China’s Korallenstrand,—\r\n  Wo Ophirs Quellen blinken,\r\n    Fortströmend goldnen Sand,—\r\n  Von manchem alten Ufer,\r\n    Von manchem Palmenland\r\n  Erschallt das Fleh’n der Rufer:\r\n    “Löst unsrer Blindheit Band!”\r\n\r\n  Gewürzte Düfte weben\r\n    Sanft über Ceylons Flur;\r\n  Es glänzt Natur und Leben\r\n    Schlecht sind die Menschen nur.\r\n  Umsonst sind Gottes Gaben\r\n    So reichlich ausgestreut;\r\n  Die blinden Heiden haben\r\n    Sich Holz und Stein geweiht.\r\n\r\n  Und wir, mit Licht im Herzen,\r\n    Mit Weisheit aus den Höh’n,\r\n  Wir könnten es verschmerzen,\r\n    Dass sie im Finstern geh’n?\r\n  Nein, nein! das Heil im Sohne\r\n    Sei laut und froh bezeugt,\r\n  Bis sich vor Christi Throne\r\n    Der fernste Volkstamm beugt!\r\n\r\n  Ihr Wasser sollt es tragen,\r\n    Ihr Winde, führt es hin,\r\n  Bis seine Strahlenwagen\r\n    Von Pol, zu Pole ziehn;\r\n  Bis der versöhnten Erde,\r\n    Das Lamm, der Sünderfreund,\r\n  Der Herr und Hirt’ der Heerde\r\n    In Herrlichkeit erscheint!\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MISSIONARY HYMN, like the hymn to which it is sung, was written\r\nin a few minutes time. Miss Mary W. Howard of Savannah, Ga., read the\r\nwords in the American edition of _The Christian Observer_, of February,\r\n1823, and was so impressed with them that she requested a young bank\r\nclerk who had gone to Georgia from New England, to write a tune for\r\nthem. He complied, and in a half hour handed her the tune which is now\r\nsung all over the world. The clerk was Lowell Mason. For further\r\ncomments on Mason see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n334. We have heard the joyful sound   _Priscilla Jane Owens_, 1829—c. 99\r\n\r\nA missionary hymn written for the anniversary of a Sunday school in\r\nBaltimore in which the author had been a worker for many years.\r\n\r\nPriscilla Jane Owens, of Scottish and Welsh descent, was born and died\r\nin Baltimore where she was a public school teacher and an untiring\r\nworker in the Sunday school. Most of her hymns were written for\r\nchildren’s services.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ JESUS SAVES was composed by William J. Kirkpatrick, 1838-1921,\r\na native of Duncannon, Pa. He was a regimental musician during the Civil\r\nWar and was skilled as an organist, gospel singer, and composer, and was\r\neditor and publisher of gospel songs.\r\n\r\n\r\n335. We’ve a story to tell to the nations      _Colin Sterne_, 1862-1928\r\n\r\nA popular missionary hymn, breathing the spirit of Christ’s great\r\ncommission: “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all nations,\r\nbaptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the\r\nHoly Spirit: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded\r\nyou: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.”\r\n\r\nThe message of the hymn, in which lies the hope of the nations, is\r\nsummarized in the chorus.\r\n\r\nThe words and music are by the same person, Henry Ernest Nichol, who was\r\nborn at Hull, England, December 10, 1862. He always signed his correct\r\nname to a tune, and the anagram “Colin Sterne,” to a hymn. Oxford\r\nUniversity gave him his degree in music. His compositions, many of them\r\nfor the church, have the simplicity and directness of the folk song. The\r\ntune here forms a splendid musical setting for the words and may be sung\r\nvariously, as a solo, duet, all the voices in unison, or in four parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n336. On the mountain top appearing             _Thomas Kelly_, 1769-1854\r\n\r\nBased on Isa. 52:7: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of\r\nhim that bringeth good tidings.” The hymn was written after the good\r\nnews came from the island of Tahiti that the first little band of\r\nmission workers sent there by the London Missionary Society, was kindly\r\nreceived by the natives, their message heard and welcomed, and that\r\nthere was every prospect for the success of the mission. Hearing the\r\nnews, Rev. Thomas Kelly wrote this hymn, entitling it, “On the Good News\r\nfrom Tahiti.” The London Missionary Society met soon afterward for an\r\nenthusiastic gathering where this hymn was first sung.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Thomas Kelly see Hymn 119.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ZION. This tune is also used with the hymn, “Guide me, O Thou\r\ngreat Jehovah,” but it is better suited to the present hymn.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Thomas Hastings, see Hymn 120.\r\n\r\n\r\n337. Ye Christian heralds, go proclaim     _Bourne H. Draper_, 1775-1843\r\n\r\nA hymn, originally of four stanzas, written as a farewell to\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\nThe author, Rev. Bourne H. Draper, was born of a Church of England\r\nfamily, near Oxford, England. He joined the Baptist Church while\r\nemployed as a printer’s apprentice at the Clarendon Press, Oxford. He\r\ntrained himself for the Baptist ministry and became pastor of the\r\nBaptist Church at Chipping-Norton. A man of great piety and poetic gift,\r\nhe wrote numerous books for children as well as devotional works and\r\nvolumes of sermons.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MISSIONARY CHANT appeared in the composer’s _American Harp_,\r\n1835, where it was identified with this hymn. Concerning the composition\r\nof the tune, Zeuner said: “I was sitting on one of those seats on Boston\r\nCommons on a most beautiful moonlight evening, all alone, with all the\r\nworld moving about me, and suddenly ‘Missionary Chant’ was given me. I\r\nran home as fast as ever I could and put it on paper before I should\r\nforget.”\r\n\r\nCharles Heinrich Christopher Zeuner, 1795-1857, a native of Germany,\r\ncame to America at the age of 29 and settled in Boston. His musical\r\nability was soon recognized, and he was made president of the Handel and\r\nHaydn Society, and later its conductor. He published a book, _American\r\nHarp_, of nearly 400 pages of tunes, in 1832, mostly his own\r\ncompositions. He moved to Philadelphia where he served as organist of\r\nSt. Anne’s Episcopal Church and later of the Arch Street Presbyterian\r\nChurch. Due to harsh criticism of his playing, he became despondent and\r\ntook his own life one November day at a lonely spot in the woods. Zeuner\r\nwas never married and had no relatives in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n338. How are Thy servants blest              _Joseph Addison_, 1672-1719\r\n\r\nA hymn of the Christian traveller, particularly descriptive of the\r\nexperience of many Christian missionaries. It is known as the\r\n“Traveller’s Hymn” and has been found useful as a part of the daily\r\ndevotions by Christians journeying in foreign lands.\r\n\r\nIt appeared in ten stanzas in the _Spectator_ for September 20, 1712, at\r\nthe end of an article on “Greatness,” with special reference to the\r\ngreatness and awesomeness of the sea. The hymn was “made by a gentleman\r\nupon the conclusion of his travels.” Returning in 1700 from the terrors\r\nof a voyage on the Mediterranean Sea, Addison gives here, years\r\nafterwards, a picture of his own trying experiences. The second stanza\r\ndescribes some of the hardships through which he passed. The omitted\r\nstanzas (3, 4, 5, 7, 8) of the hymn picture the storm at sea, its\r\nsubsidence, and the traveller’s trust in God. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n                                   3.\r\n  Thy mercy sweetened every soil,\r\n    Made every region please:\r\n  The hoary Alpine hills it warmed,\r\n    And smoothed the Tyrrhene seas.\r\n\r\n                                   4.\r\n  Think, O my soul, devoutly think\r\n    How with affrighted eyes\r\n  Thou sawest the wide-extended deep\r\n    In all its horrors rise!\r\n\r\n                                   5.\r\n  Confusion dwelt in every face,\r\n    And fear in every heart;\r\n  When waves on waves, and gulfs on gulfs,\r\n    O’ercame the pilot’s art.\r\n\r\n                                   7.\r\n  When by the dreadful tempest borne\r\n    High on the broken wave,\r\n  They know Thou art not slow to hear,\r\n    Nor impotent to save.\r\n\r\n                                   8.\r\n  The storm is laid, the winds retire,\r\n    Obedient to thy will;\r\n  The sea, that roars at thy command,\r\n    At thy command is still.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Joseph Addison see Hymn 50.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ KILMARNOCK appeared in England as a Psalm tune in _Parochial\r\nPsalmody: a New Collection of the Most Approved Psalm Tunes.... By J. P.\r\nClark, Second Edition_, 1831.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Neil Dougall, 1776-1862, son of a shipwright, went to\r\nschool until he was 15, then took to the sea. Three years later he met\r\nwith an accident which resulted in the loss of his eyesight and his\r\nright arm. He then took up the study of music and for 45 years was a\r\nsuccessful teacher of singing classes. He wrote about 100 psalm and hymn\r\ntunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n339. See how great a flame aspires             _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nA rousing missionary hymn which Wesley wrote after preaching to the coal\r\nminers at Newcastle. The imagery of the great flame was suggested by the\r\nnight scene—the glow in the sky from the blazing fires connected with\r\nthe mines. The climax of the hymn, stanza 4, was inspired by an incident\r\nin the life of Elijah. When his servant returned the seventh time from\r\nlooking toward the sea from the housetop, he reported: “Behold there\r\nariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a man’s hand!... And it came\r\nto pass in the meantime that the heaven was black with clouds and wind,\r\nand there was a great rain” (I Kings 18:41-45).\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BENEVENTO is an adaptation from a motet on the words, “_Tibi\r\nomnes angeli_” by Samuel Webbe, 1740-1816, a London organist and\r\ncomposer.\r\n\r\n\r\n340. The whole wide world for Jesus       _J. Dempster Hammond_, 1719-83\r\n\r\nThe watchword, “the whole wide world for Jesus,” brings to mind the\r\nmotto, “The evangelization of the world in this generation,” which\r\nserved to inspire the Student Volunteer Movement in the days of John R.\r\nMott, Robert E. Speer, and Sherwood Eddy. Two world wars have shaken the\r\nfoundations of the missionary enterprise, but those closest to the\r\nmovement still declare the motto to be both a possibility and an\r\nobligation. The missionary forces are making resolute plans for giving\r\nthe Gospel to the entire world.\r\n\r\nNo information is at hand concerning the author, J. Dempster Hammond.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. The composer, John H. Maunder, was born\r\nin Chelsea, England, in 1858, and died in 1920. He received his musical\r\neducation at the Royal Academy of Music in London; held various musical\r\nappointments and became a well-known and popular accompanist for\r\nvocalists. As a composer, he was widely known for his anthems, cantatas,\r\nand services which have met with wide approval. His _A Song of\r\nThanksgiving_, a cantata, has been quite popular in this country, as\r\nhave several of his anthems. In the secular field he has written much\r\nexcellent choral music, one of the best being his “The Song of Thor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n341. Jesus shall reign where’er the sun         _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nFounded on the last part of Psalm 72, this is the earliest of the great\r\nEnglish hymns on missions. It is sung by all Christian congregations in\r\nthe homelands and has probably been translated into a greater number of\r\nlanguages and dialects than any other English hymn.\r\n\r\nWatts did not hesitate to use the name of Jesus in interpreting the\r\nPsalm. On this point, he wrote in the preface to his Psalms:\r\n\r\n  Where the original runs in the form of prophecy concerning Christ and\r\n  his salvation, I have given an historical turn to the sense; there is\r\n  no necessity that we should always sing in the obscure and doubtful\r\n  style of prediction, when the things foretold are brought into the\r\n  open light by a full accomplishment.\r\n\r\n“Peculiar honors” in stanza 5 means honors appropriate to the various\r\npeoples who bring them.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DUKE STREET. This is a psalm tune by John Hatton (d. 1793), a\r\nnative of Warrington, England, of whom little is known. The tune\r\nappeared first in _A Select Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes_,\r\nGlasgow, 1793. It has long been associated with this hymn, although\r\nother tunes—“Old Hundredth,” “Warrington,” and “Truro”—have also been\r\nused with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n342. Lord of light, whose name outshineth    _Howell Elvet Lewis_, 1860—\r\n\r\nBased on the petition, “Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written for the _Congregational Hymnary_ (England), 1916. A\r\nnote by the author explains his purpose in the hymn:\r\n\r\n  The hymn was written to declare that in doing God’s will, active\r\n  co-operation is as much needed as humble resignation. Charlotte\r\n  Elliott, in her hymn, “My God and Father, while I stray,” had\r\n  expressed the latter thought beautifully. My hope was to supplement\r\n  her hymn as best I could.\r\n\r\n(Miss Elliott’s hymn is found at No. 245).\r\n\r\nHowell Elvet Lewis, of Welsh birth, became an influential leader in\r\nEnglish Congregationalism. He served as minister of the Welsh\r\nTabernacle, King’s Cross, London, and was at one time chairman of the\r\nCongregational Union of England and Wales. He is the author of a number\r\nof volumes of poems and biography.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HAST DU JESU RUF VERNOMMEN appears anonymously in the\r\n_Gesangbuch mit Noten_, set to a missionary hymn beginning with these\r\nwords. By repeating the first four lines of the first stanza of the\r\npresent hymn the refrain was made possible.\r\n\r\nThe tune was written by John R. Sweney, 1837-99, a native of West\r\nChester, Penna., who received his degrees of Mus. Bac. and Mus. Doc. at\r\nthe Pennsylvania Military Academy, Chester, Penna. Sweney was a skilled\r\nchoir leader, violinist, and pianist. He collaborated with Wm. J.\r\nKirkpatrick in the production and publishing of numerous gospel hymn\r\ntunes and hymnals. After the Civil War, he taught music in the school\r\nfrom which he received his degrees and became well known as a\r\nsong-leader at summer religious assemblies, especially at Ocean Grove,\r\nN. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n               NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LIFE—THE NATION\r\n\r\n\r\n343. O beautiful for spacious skies     _Katharine Lee Bates_, 1859-1929\r\n\r\nA beautiful poem expressing genuine love for America and faith in human\r\nbrotherhood. The historical accuracy of the second and third stanzas may\r\nbe questioned. To one familiar with New England theocracy, it is clear\r\nthat the Pilgrims were not, as the poet suggests, the champions of\r\nfreedom of thought and religion. On the contrary, they were intolerant\r\nof any form of opposition, whether religious or political.\r\n\r\nThe hymn is less limited to the New England landscape than “My country,\r\n’tis of thee,” and probably for that reason has overshadowed the latter\r\nas a popular national hymn.\r\n\r\nKatharine Lee Bates, born in Falmouth, Mass., was educated at Wellesley\r\nCollege where she later became Professor of English. She is the author\r\nof many books.\r\n\r\nA folder published by the author, giving the exact title and words of\r\nthe hymn, also contains interesting data concerning its origin and\r\nhistory:\r\n\r\n  _America the Beautiful_ was written in its original form, more\r\n  literary and ornate than the present version, in the summer of 1893. I\r\n  was making my first trip west. After visiting at Chicago the World’s\r\n  Fair, where I was naturally impressed by the symbolic beauty of the\r\n  White City, I went on to Colorado Springs. Here I spent three weeks or\r\n  so under the purple range of the Rockies, which looked down with\r\n  surprise on a summer school. This had called to its faculty several\r\n  instructors from the east, Dr. Rolfe coming from Cambridge to teach\r\n  Shakespeare, Professor Todd from Amherst for lectures on Astronomy,\r\n  Professor Katharine Coman from Wellesley for a course in Economics. My\r\n  own subject, which seemed incongruous enough under that new and\r\n  glowing sky, was English Religious Drama.\r\n\r\n  We strangers celebrated the close of the session by a merry expedition\r\n  to the top of Pike’s Peak, making the ascent by the only method then\r\n  available for people not vigorous enough to achieve the climb on foot\r\n  nor adventurous enough for burro-riding. Prairie wagons, their\r\n  tail-boards emblazoned with the traditional slogan, “Pike’s Peak or\r\n  Bust,” were pulled by horses up to the half-way house, where the\r\n  horses were relieved by mules. We were hoping for half an hour on the\r\n  summit, but two of our party became so faint in the rarified air that\r\n  we were bundled into the wagons again and started on our downward\r\n  plunge so speedily that our sojourn on the peak remains in memory\r\n  hardly more than one ecstatic gaze. It was then and there, as I was\r\n  looking out over the sea-like expanse of fertile country spreading\r\n  away so far under those ample skies, that the opening lines of the\r\n  hymn floated into my mind. When we left Colorado Springs the four\r\n  stanzas were pencilled in my note-book, together with other memoranda,\r\n  in verse and prose, of the trip. The Wellesley work soon absorbed time\r\n  and attention again, the note-book was laid aside, and I do not\r\n  remember paying heed to these verses until the second summer\r\n  following, when I copied them out and sent them to _The\r\n  Congregationalist_, where they first appeared in print July 4, 1895.\r\n  The hymn attracted an unexpected amount of attention. It was almost at\r\n  once set to music by that eminent composer, Silas G. Pratt, and\r\n  re-published with his setting, in _Famous Songs_, issued in 1895 by\r\n  the Baker and Taylor Company. Other tunes were written for the words\r\n  and so many requests came to me, with still increasing frequency, to\r\n  permit its use in various publications and for special services that,\r\n  in 1904, I re-wrote it, trying to make the phraseology more simple and\r\n  direct.\r\n\r\n  The new form first appeared in the _Evening Transcript_ of Boston,\r\n  November 19, 1904. After the lapse of a few years, during which the\r\n  hymn had run the gauntlet of criticism, I changed the wording of the\r\n  opening quatrain of the third stanza. The hymn as printed above is the\r\n  final version, of which I retain the copyright, not as a matter of\r\n  money-making, for I have given hundreds, perhaps thousands, of free\r\n  permissions for its use, but in order to protect it from misprints and\r\n  conscious alterations.\r\n\r\n  But here comes a difficulty. Over sixty original settings, some of\r\n  them by distinguished musicians, have been written for the hymn, which\r\n  thus suffers from an embarrassment of riches. It is associated with no\r\n  one tune. The original setting which has, thus far, won widest\r\n  acceptance is that of the former Municipal Organist of Portland, Will\r\n  C. MacFarlane (sold by Cressey and Allen, 534 Congress Street,\r\n  Portland, Maine). His tune, which is played on the city chimes of\r\n  Springfield, Mass., he has made the theme of a spirited march,\r\n  _America the Beautiful_, arranged for band music. In an octavo\r\n  published by Oliver Ditson Company are included four settings, one by\r\n  Clarence G. Hamilton, professor of music at Wellesley College, and\r\n  another by W. W. Sleeper, formerly pastor of the Wellesley\r\n  Congregational Church. Both these settings have found favor with\r\n  choruses and made their way into various hymnals. This octavo carries,\r\n  also, settings by William Arms Fisher, musical editor of the Boston\r\n  house of Ditson. Other tunes that have a strong following are those of\r\n  the celebrated composer, Horatio W. Parker (in the _Methodist Sunday\r\n  School Hymnal_), Charles S. Brown (in _Junior Carols_, Society of\r\n  Christian Endeavor), John Stainer (in the _Pilgrim Hymnal_), J. A.\r\n  Demuth, professor of music at Oberlin (in _Oberlin’s Favorite Hymns_,\r\n  published by Arthur P. Schmidt), and Herbert G. Peabody of Fitchburg,\r\n  Mass., (published by H. W. Gray Company of New York). Other attractive\r\n  settings, published, privately printed or yet in manuscript, have\r\n  their special circles, and the words have been fitted to various old\r\n  tunes, as those of _Auld Lang Syne_, _The Harp that Once through\r\n  Tara’s Halls_, _The Son of God goes forth to War_ and _O Mother Dear\r\n  Jerusalem_. To this last, Materna, by S. A. Ward, in many hymnals and\r\n  well known throughout the country, _America the Beautiful_ is at\r\n  present most often sung.\r\n\r\n  That the hymn has gained, in these twenty odd years, such a hold as it\r\n  has upon our people, is clearly due to the fact that Americans are at\r\n  heart idealists, with a fundamental faith in human brotherhood.\r\n\r\n                                                     Katharine Lee Bates\r\n\r\n  (Quoted by permission.)\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MATERNA (Mother) was composed for “O mother dear, Jerusalem.”\r\nThe composer, Samuel Ward, 1847-1903, resided at Newark, N. J., where he\r\noperated a successful music business and was for 14 years the director\r\nof the Orpheus Club. The tune has by popular preference become\r\ninseparably associated with the words.\r\n\r\n\r\n344. My country, ’tis of thee                 _Samuel F. Smith_, 1808-95\r\n\r\nThe best loved of our patriotic hymns, widely used, and deeply imbedded\r\nin the American soul.\r\n\r\nHis Harvard classmate, Oliver Wendell Holmes, saluted Smith in a poem\r\nwritten for their class reunion on the 30th anniversary of their\r\ngraduation as follows:\r\n\r\n  And there’s a nice youngster of excellent pith—\r\n  Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith:\r\n  But he shouted a song for the brave and the free—\r\n  Just read on his medal, “My country,” “of thee.”\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for this hymn came from the reading of a German\r\npatriotic poem sent him by Lowell Mason (See 348). The author, then a\r\nyoung student at Andover Theological Seminary, says:\r\n\r\n  I instantly felt the impulse to write a patriotic hymn of my own,\r\n  adapted to the tune. Picking up a scrap of waste paper which lay near\r\n  me, I wrote at once, probably within half an hour, the hymn,\r\n  “America,” as it is now known everywhere. The whole hymn stands today\r\n  as it stood on the bit of waste paper.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was first sung at a children’s festival in Park Street Church,\r\nBoston, July 4, 1832.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Samuel F. Smith, see Hymn 324.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ AMERICA is also the tune used with the national anthem of\r\nBritain, “God save the king.” The melody is of obscure origin. It has\r\nbeen known in England for several centuries. In Denmark it was used\r\ntoward the end of the 18th century for a national hymn, “_Heil dir dem\r\nliebenden_,” and in Germany it was widely used in Prussian and other\r\nnorthern states to patriotic words. In earlier days in the United\r\nStates, the words, “Come Thou Almighty King,” were sung to this tune.\r\nThe tune has thus nearly come to be an International Anthem.\r\n\r\nHenry Carey, 1692-1743, an English musician of considerable ability,\r\nknown as the composer of the song, “Sally in Our Alley,” is sometimes\r\ncredited with this tune but the evidence is disputed. He wrote songs and\r\npoems for light and burlesque operas but always with regard for decency\r\nand good manners. His life was ended by suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n345. Judge Eternal, throned in splendor           _Henry Scott Holland_,\r\n                                                               1874-1918\r\n\r\nA prayer for the nation.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written with the English Empire in mind, but its message\r\nand concern for the removal of national evils are such as to make it\r\nappropriate for use nearly everywhere.\r\n\r\nHenry Scott Holland had a distinguished career at Oxford and attained to\r\nnumerous positions of responsibility in the Church of England. He was\r\nProfessor of Divinity at Oxford and later Canon of St. Paul’s Cathedral.\r\nThe two chief interests of his fruitful life were social reform and\r\nmissionary work, both of which are embodied in this, his only hymn. The\r\npoem was published in July, 1902, in _The Commonwealth_, a Christian\r\nsocial magazine which Dr. Holland edited, and was included in the\r\n_English Hymnal_ in 1906.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SICILIAN MARINERS. For comments on this tune see Hymn 45.\r\n\r\n\r\n346. Once to every man and nation        _James Russell Lowell_, 1819-91\r\n\r\nA powerful hymn of national righteousness, taken from Lowell’s poem\r\ncalled “The Present Crisis,” 1845, the crisis being the war with Mexico\r\nwhich the author held to be unjust and would only result in enlarging\r\nthe area of slavery. To make the meter of the poem regular enough to be\r\nsung, some alteration was inevitable.\r\n\r\nJames Russell Lowell graduated from Harvard in 1838 and was admitted to\r\nthe bar two years later. He succeeded Longfellow as Professor of Modern\r\nLanguages and Literature in Harvard, in 1855. From 1857 to 1862 he\r\nedited the _Atlantic Monthly_ and the nine years following that he was\r\neditor of the _North American Review_. In 1877 he was appointed minister\r\nto Spain, and in 1881, to England, remaining at the latter post four\r\nyears. He wrote various volumes of poetry and was a prominent\r\nanti-slavery writer both in verse and prose.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ TON-Y-BOTEL, also known as “Ebenezer,” is a “solemn tune, of\r\nvery simple structure, being formed, throughout, of imitations of the\r\nfirst bar.” A letter from the copyright owners, W. Gwenlyn Evans and\r\nSon, Caernarvon, Wales, written by A. Vaughan Evans, throws interesting\r\nlight on this tune and the origin of the fictitious story which gave\r\nrise to the name TON-Y-BOTEL. It reads, in part:\r\n\r\n  ... We have pleasure in granting permission to use the tune Ebenezer\r\n  (Ton-Y-Botel) free of charge in the Mennonite Hymn Book.... It is an\r\n  original Welsh composition by T. J. Williams ... and was part of a\r\n  Memorial Anthem ‘_Goleu yn y Glyn_’ (Light in the Vale) in memory of a\r\n  friend of the composer....\r\n\r\n  You will have noticed above that the correct name of the tune is\r\n  Ebenezer and it may be of interest to learn how it acquired the\r\n  ‘nickname’ Ton-Y-Botel (the bottle tune). Not long after the Welsh\r\n  Revival of 1904 the tune spread all over Wales and then England and\r\n  Scotland ‘by ear.’ There were no written or printed copies of it. A\r\n  crowd of young men were singing it on a hilltop just outside this town\r\n  of Caernarvon and the usual questions were asked: Who was the\r\n  composer, etc., when a lad for a joke said the tune had been found in\r\n  a bottle washed up by the tide on the beach at Dinas Dinlle (a small\r\n  bathing place in the Irish Sea near here). Ever since the tune has\r\n  been called by the Welsh equivalent of “Bottle Tune.” One of the young\r\n  men made a written copy of the music as it was sung all over the\r\n  country, and brought it to us to print. The demand was enormous and we\r\n  published hundred of thousands of copies.... We purchased the\r\n  copyright and now the tune appears in hymnals all over the\r\n  world—except in Wales, the country of its origin. I do not think it is\r\n  a case of the prophet being without honour in his own country, but\r\n  rather that the popularity was so great that it was sung everywhere—in\r\n  taverns and public houses, non-religious words were sung to it,\r\n  etc.—with the result that the tune was regarded as not quite\r\n  ‘respectable’ by the generation which produced it. No doubt it will be\r\n  valued by later generations of Welsh people. This has happened with\r\n  several of the best-known Welsh hymns as many of them 200 years ago\r\n  were of secular origin.\r\n\r\n  I am giving the above details so that something of its history may be\r\n  on record in the United States, and hope they may be of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n347. God of our fathers, whose Almighty hand        _Daniel C. Roberts_,\r\n                                                               1841-1907\r\n\r\nA hymn of broadminded patriotism, called forth by the “Centennial”\r\nFourth of July celebration in 1876, held at Brandon, Vt. It was\r\npublished in various papers at the time and included in the _Hymnal_ of\r\nthe Protestant Episcopal Church in 1894. Since then it has appeared in a\r\nnumber of other church hymnals.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written by Daniel C. Roberts, a graduate of Kenyon College,\r\nand a clergyman in the Episcopal Church.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NATIONAL HYMN was used at the Columbian celebration service at\r\nSt. Thomas’ Church, New York City, Sunday morning, October 9, 1892. It\r\nis one of the finest processional tunes in the hymn book. The trumpet\r\nintroduction and the interludes, making it unique among hymn tunes,\r\ngives it a quickening martial rhythm yet without losing its spirit of\r\nsanctity and reverence.\r\n\r\nThe composer, George William Warren, 1828-1902, was an American\r\norganist, born at Albany, N. Y. Though self-taught, he held responsible\r\npositions as organist in Albany and then at Holy Trinity and St. Thomas’\r\nchurches in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n348. God bless our native land        _Siegfried A. Mahlmann_, 1771-1826\r\n                                 _Stanza 3, William E. Hickson_, 1803-70\r\n\r\nThe first two stanzas are a free translation of Stanzas 1 and 3 of the\r\nfollowing patriotic song for Saxony:\r\n\r\n                                   1.\r\n  Gott segne Sachsenland,\r\n  Wo fest die Treue stand\r\n    In Sturm und Nacht!\r\n  Ew’ge Gerechtigkeit,\r\n  Hoch überm Meer der Zeit,\r\n  Die jedem Sturm gebeut,\r\n    Schütz uns mit Macht!\r\n\r\n                                   2.\r\n  Blühe, du Rautenkranz\r\n  In schöner Tage Glanz\r\n    Freudig empor!\r\n  Heil, Friedrich August, dir!\r\n  Heil, guter König, dir!\r\n  Dich, Vater, preisen wir\r\n    Liebend im Chor!\r\n\r\n                                   3.\r\n  Was treue Herzen flehn\r\n  Steigt zu des Himmels Höh’n\r\n    Aus Nacht zum Licht.\r\n  Der unsre Liebe sah,\r\n  Der unsre Tränen sah,\r\n  Er ist uns huldreich nah,\r\n    Verlässt uns nicht.\r\n\r\nA fourth stanza, identical with the first, follows.\r\n\r\nIt was written by the German song writer, Siegfried Augustus Mahlmann,\r\nand published in G. W. Fink’s _Musikalischer Hausschatz_, 1842. The hymn\r\nwas first sung Nov. 13, 1815, in the presence of the King of Saxony. The\r\nhymn was also the inspiration for Samuel F. Smith’s, “My country ’tis of\r\nthee.”\r\n\r\nThe translation was made in 1834 by Charles T. Brooks, while a student\r\nat the Divinity School at Cambridge, Mass. It was revised by John\r\nSullivan Dwight, 1813-93, to form our version. Dwight was a graduate of\r\nHarvard Divinity School and became a Unitarian minister in Northampton,\r\nMass., but gave up the ministry to devote himself to literature and\r\nmusic. For thirty years he owned and edited Dwight’s _Journal of Music_.\r\n\r\nThe third stanza, raising the hymn above any narrow patriotism, was\r\nadded by William E. Hickson, an English shoe manufacturer who retired\r\nfrom that business to pursue literary and philanthropic interests. Much\r\ninterested in the musical culture of his people, he published various\r\nbooks on music and composed numerous musical works of merit. For a time\r\nhe was editor of the _Westminster Review_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DORT. For comments on the composer of this tune, Lowell Mason,\r\nsee Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n349. Great God of nations, now to Thee     _Alfred A. Woodhull_, 1810-36\r\n\r\nEntitled “Thanksgiving Hymn,” this poem was written in 1828 when the\r\nauthor was only eighteen years old. It was published in the Presbyterian\r\n_Psalms and Hymns_, 1829, Princeton, N. J. There have been many\r\nalterations of the lines.\r\n\r\nAlfred Alexander Woodhull, son of a Presbyterian minister, graduated\r\nfrom Princeton at 18 years of age, and then took a medical course at the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. He began the practice of medicine at\r\nMarietta, Pennsylvania, then moved to Princeton where within a year he\r\ncontracted a fever which occasioned his death. Known as a fine Christian\r\nman as well as a skilled physician, his early death was greatly\r\nlamented. He was a member of the Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MENDON. For comments on this tune see Hymn 211.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WORLD FRIENDSHIP AND PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\n350. O God, we pray for all mankind       _Howard J. Conover_, 1850-1925\r\n\r\nA prayer for all the nations.\r\n\r\nThe author, Howard J. Conover, was born in New Jersey, the son of devout\r\nChristian parents. He was educated at Pennington Seminary, Pennington,\r\nN. J., and Dickinson College. He took up the ministry and was known to\r\nbe a studious, devout, and thoroughly faithful pastor, serving a number\r\nof churches in his native state. A nephew, Elbert M. Conover, is the\r\ndirector of The Interdenominational Bureau of Architecture, with offices\r\nin New York City, serving twenty-five denominations.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ORTONVILLE. For comments on this tune see Hymn 120.\r\n\r\n\r\n351. God the All-Merciful                    _Henry F. Chorley_, 1808-72\r\n\r\nA touching cry for peace, based on the Russian national hymn by Chorley.\r\nThis paraphrase was written by John Ellerton, in 1870, during the\r\nFranco-Prussian War. It was published in _Church Hymns_ in 1871.\r\n\r\nHenry F. Chorley, an English man of letters, received his education at\r\nthe Royal Institution, Liverpool. He was a literary and music critic and\r\na friend and great admirer of Charles Dickens. For 34 years he was on\r\nthe editorial staff of the _Athenaeum_, published in London.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ RUSSIAN HYMN was composed for the words, “God save the Czar,”\r\nthe national Russian anthem written in 1833. It is a stately, powerful\r\ntune which most congregations love to sing, especially after it has been\r\nused often enough to overcome certain of its difficulties. It was\r\nwritten at the command of the Czar who ordered it adopted for the army.\r\nBut there is nothing about the tune itself to render it inappropriate\r\nfor the churches. In his _Memoirs_, Lwoff says that in composing this\r\ntune he “felt and fully appreciated the necessity of accomplishing\r\nsomething which would be robust, stately, stirring, national in\r\ncharacter, something worthy to reverberate either in a church, through\r\nthe soldiers’ ranks, or amongst a crowd of people, something which would\r\nappeal alike to the lettered and the ignorant.”\r\n\r\nThe composer, Alexis T. Lwoff, 1799-1871, was an eminent Russian\r\nmusician, succeeding his father in St. Petersburg as head of the\r\nimperial choir where he not only maintained the traditions of that great\r\norganization, but raised it to still greater heights of eminence. He\r\ncomposed violin concertos, operas, and church music. Lwoff had a\r\nthorough understanding of the canonical services of the Russian Church,\r\nand his collection of ritual chants is still considered authoritative.\r\n\r\n\r\n352. O God of love, O King of peace            _Henry W. Baker_, 1821-77\r\n\r\nAn ardent prayer for universal peace. This noble hymn was contributed by\r\nthe author to _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, London, 1861, a notable book\r\nof which Baker was chief editor.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Henry W. Baker, see Hymn 143.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ QUEBEC. For comments on this tune and its composer see Hymn\r\n171.\r\n\r\n\r\n353. Let there be light, Lord God of hosts     _William Merrill Vories_,\r\n                                                                   1880—\r\n\r\nA good peace hymn.\r\n\r\nThe author, William Merrill Vories, was born in Leavenworth, Kansas. He\r\nis the founder of an independent mission in the province of Omi, Japan.\r\nVories published the present poem February, 1909, in the _Advocate of\r\nPeace_. Since that time, it has found a place in a number of hymn books.\r\nThe copyright, appropriately enough, is held by the American Peace\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PENTECOST, a dignified tune, simple in structure, was first\r\nused with the hymn, “Veni Creator,” and appeared in _Thirty-two Hymn\r\nTunes, Composed by Members of the University of Oxford_, 1868. It was\r\nrevised by Arthur Sullivan who set it to Monsell’s hymn, “Fight the good\r\nfight with all thy might,” for the tune lends itself to spirited\r\nrendition as well as the more devotional and contemplative as required\r\nby the present hymn.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Rev. William Boyd, 1847-1928, was born in Jamaica and\r\neducated at Oxford where Baring-Gould was his tutor. The latter asked\r\nhim to compose a tune to “Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,” for a\r\nmeeting of Yorkshire coal miners on the Day of Pentecost. The result was\r\nthis tune to which he gave the name PENTECOST. Boyd was ordained priest\r\nin 1882 and from 1893 until his retirement in 1918, he was vicar of All\r\nSaints, Norfolk Square, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n354. Father eternal, Ruler of creation         _Laurence Housman_, 1865—\r\n\r\nOne of the hymns of our time in which, characteristically, the\r\ninternational note is struck. It was written at the request of the Rev.\r\nH. R. L. (Dick) Sheppard, minister of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields,\r\nLondon, for the Life and Liberty movement after World War I. The bitter\r\nexperiences of that war, with the subsequent fear and distrust among the\r\nnations, had intensified the longing for the realization of the petition\r\nin the Lord’s Prayer, “Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”\r\nThis hymn gives utterance to that longing.\r\n\r\nLaurence Housman is an English artist known chiefly for his book\r\nillustrations, but he is also known as a writer of poetry and prose of\r\nmerit. A contemporary wrote of him: “He has the heart of compassion for\r\nthe little ones of the earth, the dumb and the helpless, that ought to\r\nbe, but is not always, an essential part of poetry. His is the true\r\nFranciscan spirit.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ OLD 124TH is from the _Genevan Psalter_, 1551, where it is set\r\nto Psalm 124. It is commonly attributed to L. Bourgeois (See 34). The\r\ntune has always been popular in England with the non-conformist churches\r\nand is one of the few surviving tunes from the _Old Version Psalter._\r\n\r\n\r\n355. Not alone for mighty empire        _William Pierson Merrill_, 1867—\r\n\r\nA hymn of thanksgiving and of the higher patriotism, glorying not in\r\nempire nor in battleship and fortress but in the things of the spirit\r\nwhich have made America great. It was first printed in _The Continent_,\r\na Presbyterian paper, now defunct, published in Chicago.\r\n\r\nConcerning the origin of the hymn, Dr. Merrill wrote in a letter dated\r\nApril 18, 1947:\r\n\r\n  The occasion for the writing of this hymn was a Union Thanksgiving\r\n  Service in Chicago, where Jenkin Lloyd Jones made a prayer, in which\r\n  he thanked God more for spiritual values in our national life than for\r\n  any temporal ones. That prayer inspired my hymn.\r\n\r\nHoward Chandler Robbins, Professor of Pastoral Theology in the General\r\nTheological Seminary, New York City, says: “On Thanksgiving Day we all\r\nought to be singing Dr. Merrill’s great Thanksgiving hymn, one of the\r\ngreatest national hymns in the English language.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on William Pierson Merrill see Hymn 183.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ IN BABILONE.

The hymn was written\r\nby Henry Warburton Hawkes, an English Unitarian.\r\n\r\nNo further information is at hand concerning the author.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FFIGYSBREN.

Peace in our time, O Lord                 _John Oxenham_, 1852-1941\r\n\r\nA beautiful prayer for the peace which is “based upon Thy will and built\r\nin righteousness.” The author, having learned that a new hymnary was to\r\nbe published, and aware of the Mennonite position on war and peace, sent\r\nthis hymn from England for inclusion in this book with the request that\r\nit be used with the tune “Diademata.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, John Oxenham, see Hymn 320.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DIADEMATA.

Findlater_, 1823-1907\r\n\r\n  O selig Haus, wo man dich aufgenommen,\r\n    Du wahrer Seelenfreund, Herr Jesu Christ;\r\n  Wo unter allen Gästen, die da kommen,\r\n    Du der gefeiertste und liebste bist;\r\n  Wo aller Herzen dir entgegenschlagen\r\n    Und aller Augen freudig auf dich sehn;\r\n  Wo aller Lippen dein Gebot erfragen\r\n    Und alle deines Winks gewärtig stehn!\r\n\r\n  O selig Haus, wo Mann und Weib in _einer_,\r\n    In deiner Liebe _eines_ Geistes sind,\r\n  Als beide _eines_ Heils gewürdigt, keiner\r\n    Im Glaubensgrunde anders ist gesinnt;\r\n  Wo beide unzertrennbar an dir hangen\r\n    In Lieb’ und Leid, Gemach und Ungemach,\r\n  Und nur bei dir zu bleiben stets verlangen\r\n    An jedem guten wie am bösen Tag!\r\n\r\n  O selig Haus, wo man die lieben Kleinen\r\n    Mit Händen des Gebets ans Herz dir legt,\r\n  Du Freund der Kinder, der sie als die Seinen\r\n    Mit mehr als Mutterliebe hegt und pflegt;\r\n  Wo sie zu deinen Füssen gern sich sammeln\r\n    Und horchen deiner süssen Rede zu\r\n  Und lernen früh dein Lob mit Freuden stammeln,\r\n    Sich deiner freun du lieber Heiland, du!\r\n\r\n  O selig Haus, wo du die Freude teilest,\r\n    Wo man bei keiner Freude dein vergisst!\r\n  O selig Haus, wo du die Wunden heilest\r\n    Und aller Arzt und aller Tröster bist,\r\n  Bis jeder einst sein Tagewerk vollendet,\r\n    Und bis sie endlich alle ziehen aus\r\n  Dahin, woher der Vater dich gesendet,\r\n    Ins grosse, freie, schöne Vaterhaus!\r\n\r\nBased on Luke 19:9: “This day is salvation come to this house,” the poem\r\noriginally bore the title, “Salvation is come to this house.” It is\r\nprobably the best hymn ever written on the Christian home.\r\n\r\nThe author of the hymn enjoyed a singularly happy and peaceful home\r\nlife, not only under the parental roof, but also after he was married\r\nand had established his own home. Carl Spitta, Lutheran minister and\r\ngreatest German hymn writer of the nineteenth century, was born in\r\nHannover. His father came from a Huguenot family that fled France during\r\nthe Catholic persecutions and died when Carl was only four years old.\r\nHis mother was a Christian Jewess whose loving care no doubt inspired\r\nthe son to write this hymn on the home. After completing his theological\r\nstudies in 1824, Spitta taught school for four years and then was\r\nordained in 1828 to the Lutheran ministry. He passed through a deep\r\nspiritual experience about this time which resulted in the composition\r\nof his finest hymns. “In the manner in which I formerly sang,” he wrote\r\na friend in 1826, “I sing no more. To the Lord I dedicate my life, my\r\nlove, and likewise my song. He gave to me song and melody. I give it\r\nback to Him.”\r\n\r\nHis hymns were received with enthusiasm and held in the same esteem in\r\nGermany as Keble’s _Christian Year_ in England. His collection of hymns,\r\n_Psalter und Harfe_, first published in 1833, passed through more than\r\n50 editions and a second collection printed in 1843 had by 1887 passed\r\nthrough 42 editions.\r\n\r\nSpitta had a family of seven children, one of whom became Professor of\r\nNew Testament Exegesis and Practical Theology in the University of\r\nStrassburg, and another, John August Spitta, wrote the monumental\r\nfour-volume work on the life of J. S. Bach.\r\n\r\nThe translator of the hymn, Sarah Findlater, also knew the blessings of\r\na happy home. Her daughter wrote concerning her mother:\r\n\r\n  Her home life with my father was almost idyllically happy, in the\r\n  small manse at Lochearnhead, where there never was enough of money,\r\n  yet where my parents exercised unceasing hospitality—almost foolish\r\n  hospitality. They were both great readers, and used to read aloud to\r\n  each other for hours. My mother was an excellent linguist, and her\r\n  German translations were a great pleasure to her. That simple little\r\n  hymn of hers which begins “O happy home,” is really an epitome of her\r\n  home life with my father—they were so single-eyed in their longing to\r\n  serve God: it came first with them always.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Sarah Findlater, see comments on her sister,\r\nJane Borthwick, Hymn 54.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ O SELIG HAUS is a popular German melody written in 1854 by\r\nEdward Niemeyer. Information concerning the composer has not been\r\ntraced.\r\n\r\n\r\n359. Thou gracious God, whose mercy lends       _Oliver Wendell Holmes_,\r\n                                                                 1809-94\r\n\r\nWritten by Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1869 to be read or sung at the\r\nannual meeting of the 1829 college class of Harvard University, of which\r\nhe was a member. The famous class included in its membership J. Freeman\r\nClarke, founder of the Disciples, and Samuel F. Smith, author of\r\n“America.” The forty years of retrospect, mingled with sunshine and\r\nshadow, are touched here with tenderness and grace.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Oliver W. Holmes see Hymn 172.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ES KAM DIE GNADENVOLLE appears in the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_ to\r\nthe words, “Früh Morgens da die Sonn’ Aufgeht.”\r\n\r\nThe composer, Johann Heinrich Egli, 1741-1810, was born in Seegräben,\r\nSwitzerland. He was a pupil of Pastor Schmiedli at Wetzikon, and became\r\na music teacher in Zurich, where he died. His compositions for voice,\r\nboth sacred and secular, won great popularity in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\n360. There is beauty all around               _John H. McNaughton_, 1863\r\n\r\nA tender lyric in praise of the home where love dwells. Especially fine\r\nare the lines,\r\n\r\n  All the earth is filled with love\r\n  When there’s love at home,\r\n\r\nfor it recognizes the wide influence of the home, the primary social\r\ninstitution where the first lessons of the Christian life are learned. A\r\nnation’s peace and prosperity is rooted in the quality of life found in\r\nits homes.\r\n\r\nThe words and music are by John Hugh McNaughton, who was born 1829, in\r\nCaledonia, N. Y., of Scottish parentage. His lyrics have some literary\r\nqualities and Henry W. Longfellow once wrote to McNaughton: “Your poems\r\nhave touched me very much.” He composed many popular songs, including\r\n“The Blue and the Gray,” and “Faded Coat of Blue,” which sold by the\r\nhundreds of thousands of copies. He is the author of a _Treatise on\r\nMusic and Onnalinda_, a metrical romance.\r\n\r\n\r\n361. Happy the home when God is there       _Henry Ware_, Jr., 1794-1843\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest hymns on the Christian home. It first appeared in\r\n_Selections of Hymns and Poetry_, Boston, 1846, compiled by Mrs. Herbert\r\nMayo, where it was entitled, “The Happy Home.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Henry Ware, Jr., see Hymn 13.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST.

Bless the four corners of this house            _Arthur Guiterman_,\r\n                                                               1871-1943\r\n\r\nA poem for use in the dedication of a Christian home, first printed in\r\n_House and Garden_ magazine about thirty years ago. Since then it has\r\nbecome widely known both here and abroad. Its first use as a hymn was in\r\nthe _Methodist Hymnal_ of 1935, edited by Dr. Robert McCutchan.\r\n\r\nThe author, Arthur Guiterman, was a writer, poet, and speaker. He was\r\nborn in Vienna, Austria, November 20, 1871, of American parents, his\r\nmother being a native of Ohio. Most of his education was received in New\r\nYork City, his college course having been completed in the City College.\r\nGuiterman was a frequent contributor to _Harper’s Magazine_, _The\r\nSaturday Evening Post_, _The Youth’s Companion_, _Ladies Home Journal_,\r\nand other leading magazines. His poetry is written on a large variety of\r\nsubjects. Joyce Kilmer characterized him as “the most American of\r\npoets.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ICH SINGE DIR is a familiar melody in the _Gesangbuch mit\r\nNoten_ where it appears anonymously, set to the words, “_Ich singe Dir\r\nmit Herz und Mund_,” by Paul Gerhardt.\r\n\r\n\r\n363. Lord of life and King of glory             _Christian Burke_, 1859—\r\n\r\nA mother’s prayer, written by Miss Burke in December, 1903, and\r\npublished the following February in _The Treasury_, where it was headed,\r\n“Prize Hymn for Mothers’ Union Service.” It was included in _The English\r\nHymnal_, 1906.\r\n\r\nMiss Christian Burke was born in London. She contributed poems to\r\nvarious periodicals and in 1896 published a collection of her poetic\r\nwritings, with the title, _The Flowering of the Almond Tree_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune was found in _St. Basil’s Hymnal_, published by the\r\nBasilian Fathers, Chicago, 1918. It bears no name and the composer is\r\nnot identified. The hymn is also sung to the tune “Silician Mariners”\r\n(45).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MOTHER’S DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n364. Motherhood, sublime, eternal              _J. S. Cutler_, 1856-1930\r\n\r\nSuitable for Mother’s Day.\r\n\r\nThe hymn and tune are found in _Hymns of the Spirit_, published in\r\nBoston, 1937.\r\n\r\nJulian Stearns Cutler, born at Thomaston, Maine, graduated from Tufts\r\nTheological School, Tufts College, Mass., in 1885, and served\r\nUniversalist churches in Marblehead, Melrose, and Orange, Mass.,\r\n1896-1904; in Little Falls, N. Y., 1904-10; and in Pawtucket, R. I.,\r\n1910-26. He wrote a good deal of occasional verse published in\r\nnewspapers, especially in the _Boston Transcript_, and his collected\r\npoems were privately printed under the title, _Songs of Cheer_, about a\r\nyear after his death. His hymn, “Motherhood, sublime, eternal,” written\r\nabout 1910, was adapted for use in Universalist hymn books and in\r\nslightly altered form in _Hymns of the Spirit_, 1937. It was taken from\r\nthe latter for use in the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MOTHERHOOD. No information has been traced concerning the\r\norigin of this tune or its composer, Willis A. Moore, except that Moore\r\nwas a member of the Universalists but left their fellowship some years\r\nago. The Universalist Publishing House, Boston, from whom inquiry was\r\nmade, has no further information at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FAREWELL SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\n365. God be with you till we meet again            _Jeremiah E. Rankin,_\r\n                                                               1828-1904\r\n\r\nWritten for the purpose of a Christian good-by.\r\n\r\nThe author, Jeremiah E. Rankin, was pastor of the First Congregational\r\nChurch in Washington, D. C., when he wrote this hymn. Later, in 1889, he\r\nbecame president of Howard University, a Negro institution in the same\r\ncity. He was always a friend of the colored people and did what he could\r\nfor their advancement.\r\n\r\nHe has given us the origin of the hymn as follows:\r\n\r\n  Written in 1882 as a Christian good-by, it was called forth by no\r\n  person or occasion, but was deliberately composed as a Christian hymn\r\n  on the basis of the etymology of “good-by,” which is “God be with\r\n  you.” The first stanza was written and sent to two composers—one of\r\n  unusual note, the other wholly unknown and not thoroughly educated in\r\n  music. I selected the composition of the latter, submitted it to J. W.\r\n  Bishoff (the musical director of a little book we were preparing), who\r\n  approved of it but made some criticisms which were adopted. It was\r\n  sung for the first time one evening in the First Congregational Church\r\n  in Washington, of which I was then the pastor and Mr. Bishoff the\r\n  organist. I attributed its popularity in no little part to the music\r\n  to which it was set. It was a wedding of words and music, at which it\r\n  was my function to preside; but Mr. Tomer should have his full share\r\n  of the family honor.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FAREWELL was composed by William G. Tomer, 1832-96, an American\r\njournalist who made music his avocation. In early life he taught school,\r\nlater becoming the editor of the _Hunterdon Gazette_ at High Ridge, New\r\nJersey. The hymn he helped make famous was sung at his funeral by a\r\nlarge assembly of friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OUR FOREFATHERS\r\n\r\n\r\n366. Uplift the song of praise          _Frederick L. Hosmer,_ 1840-1929\r\n\r\nA hymn of praise for God’s leading of our forefathers. The author traced\r\nhis own descent from the Pilgrim Fathers, one of his ancestors, James\r\nHosmer, having come to Concord in 1635. In writing the hymn, he had the\r\nPilgrims in mind, but his words are fully as applicable to other\r\nimmigrant groups such as the Mennonites who came at different times from\r\nEurope to settle here in “lands untrod.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Frederick L. Hosmer see Hymn 72.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC,_ LEONI (Yigdal). For comments on this tune see Hymn 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n367. O God, beneath Thy guiding hand            _Leonard Bacon_, 1802-81\r\n\r\nWritten for the 200th anniversary of the founding of New Haven, Conn.,\r\ncelebrated April 25, 1833, in Center Church where the author was pastor.\r\nDr. Bacon delivered the main historical address on this occasion and\r\nused the theme of the sermon for the basis of this hymn.\r\n\r\nLeonard Bacon, son of missionaries to the Indians at the then frontier\r\ntrading post of Detroit, graduated from Yale and Andover Theological\r\nSeminary. He was minister of the Center Congregational Church, New\r\nHaven, for the forty-one years from 1825 to 1866 and professor and\r\nlecturer at Yale Divinity School from 1866 till his death in 1881.\r\nAlways interested in sacred music, he rendered a great service to the\r\nchurch by the hymns he wrote as well as his compilations of hymns.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DUKE STREET. For comments on this tune see Hymn 341.\r\n\r\n\r\n368. In pleasant lands have fall’n the lines    _James Flint_, 1779-1855\r\n\r\nA fine memorial hymn.\r\n\r\nThe author, James Flint, was born in Reading, Mass. After graduating\r\nfrom Harvard, he served as pastor of the Unitarian Church at East\r\nBridgewater, Mass., 1806-1821, and at the East Church, Salem, Mass.,\r\nfrom 1821 until his death in 1855. His hymns were published in his\r\n_Collection of Hymns for the Christian Church and Home_, 1840, the\r\npresent being the single one which survives today.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WAREHAM. For comments on this tune see Hymn 208.\r\n\r\n\r\n369. Eternal One, Thou living God           _Samuel Longfellow_, 1819-92\r\n\r\nA hymn of the Church Universal, the great company of faithful souls of\r\nevery age and land. The God who led our fathers, still leads His people\r\ninto new truth and sets before them new goals.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Samuel Longfellow see Hymn 28.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WINCHESTER NEW. This tune is also used extensively with\r\nMilman’s hymn, “Ride on! Ride on in majesty” (101). It was set to the\r\nhymn, “_Wer nur den lieben Gott lässt walten_,” in the _Musikalisches\r\nHandbuch_, printed in Hamburg, 1690. The earlier history of the tune is\r\nobscure, and its composer is unknown. It appeared in various collections\r\nunder the name “Frankfurt” and “Crasselius.” In a volume published in\r\nGlasgow, 1762, entitled, _The Psalm-Singer’s Delightful Pocket\r\nCompanion_, it was used in long meter and named “Winchester.” It should\r\nnot be confused with “Winchester Old” (191).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HOSPITAL SUNDAY\r\n\r\n\r\n370. Thou to whom the sick and dying         _Godfrey Thring_, 1823-1903\r\n\r\nA hospital hymn written in 1870 under the text, “And they brought unto\r\nHim all sick people ... and He healed them” (Matt. 4:24).\r\n\r\nIt was first published in _Hymns for the Church Service_, 1871, by W. H.\r\nHutton. Later it was revised for the author’s _Hymns and Sacred Lyrics_,\r\n1874.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Godfrey Thring, see Hymn 89.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WALTHAM. The tune appears with its original name, “Gott des\r\nHimmels und der Erden,” at Hymn 573, which see for comments on the tune\r\nand the composer. The original form of the melody is in triple time.\r\nBach thought enough of the tune to use it in his _Christmas Oratorio_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TEMPERANCE SUNDAY\r\n\r\n\r\n371. Now to heav’n our pray’r ascending    _William E. Hickson_, 1803-70\r\n\r\nA crusading hymn full of assurance that the cause of right, though\r\ndelayed by its foes, will surely succeed in God’s own time.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, William E. Hickson, see Hymn 348.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GOD SPEED THE RIGHT is attributed to Ernst Moritz Arndt,\r\n1769-1860, a German preacher, editor, professor of history, and writer\r\nof sacred and secular songs. Julian speaks of him as a “man of learning,\r\na true patriot, a distinguished poet ... a man of deep religious\r\nfeeling, and a true-hearted and earnest witness of the Evangelical\r\nFaith.” The _Dictionary_ notes a number of his hymns but makes no\r\nmention of musical compositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LABOR DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n372. Jesus, Thou divine Companion            _Henry van Dyke_, 1852-1933\r\n\r\nA fine hymn on the dignity of labor, holding up the ideal of Christian\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Henry van Dyke, see Hymn 10.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HYFRYDOL. For comments on this Welsh tune see Hymn 69.\r\n\r\n\r\n373. O Son of Man, Thou madest known            _Milton S. Littlefield_,\r\n                                                               1864-1934\r\n\r\nA hymn on the sacredness of work, connecting Jesus with the labor of\r\nmankind. The emphasis on the social aspect of religion in terms of our\r\ncommon life is a dominant note in twentieth-century hymnody.\r\n\r\nThe author, Milton S. Littlefield, was born in New York City; educated\r\nat Johns Hopkins and Union Theological Seminary; and became an honored\r\nand prominent Presbyterian minister. Recognized as an authority in the\r\nfield of hymnology, he edited two hymn books and was elected president\r\nof the American Hymn Society, 1927-28. Besides the present hymn, he\r\nwrote another beginning with the line, “Come, O Lord, like morning\r\nsunlight.” Both are serviceable hymns, and it is singular that neither\r\nfound its way into the Presbyterian _Hymnal_, 1933.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BROOKFIELD. This tune first appeared in the _Congregational\r\nChurch Hymnal_, London, 1887, edited by Dr. E. J. Hopkins (See 43). The\r\nbook contained the best hymn tunes for congregational singing then\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Thomas Bishop Southgate, 1814-68, received his musical\r\neducation under Sir John Goss and Samuel S. Wesley. For many years he\r\nwas organist at St. Anne’s Church, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n374. Though lowly here our lot may be         _William Gaskell_, 1805-84\r\n\r\nA hymn on the dignity of all work which is done through faith and trust\r\nin Christ.\r\n\r\nThe author, William Gaskell, studied at Glasgow University and\r\nManchester College, York, and became a Unitarian minister. His one and\r\nonly charge was Cross Street Chapel, Manchester. He became Professor of\r\nEnglish History and Literature in Manchester New College and was an\r\ninfluential leader in the community in the promotion of education and\r\nculture. His denomination bestowed upon him its highest honors. Mrs.\r\nGaskell, a woman of brilliance and unusual literary gifts was encouraged\r\nby her husband to engage in literary work to distract her mind from the\r\ngrief caused by the death of their little son. She turned out to be a\r\npopular writer, publishing works of fiction and the life of Charlotte\r\nBrontë. A memorial to her bears testimony to her genius, and to the\r\n“tenderness and fidelity” with which she adorned the minister’s home.\r\nGaskell, a pioneer in social reform, wrote this hymn sometime before\r\n1860.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ABRIDGE is also known as “ST. STEPHEN” (See 266 and 590).\r\n\r\nFor comments on the tune see Hymn 266.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HARVEST AND THANKSGIVING\r\n\r\n\r\n375. We plow the fields, and scatter      _Matthias Claudius_, 1740-1815\r\n\r\nThis is one of the finest harvest hymns.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 Claudius wrote a sketch called, “Paul Erdman’s Feast,” in which\r\nthere is an interesting picture of a harvest thanksgiving celebration in\r\nthe home of a North German farmer. The farm folk gather at the house of\r\nErdman and as they do so they sing:\r\n\r\n  Wir pflügen und wir streuen\r\n  Den Samen auf das Land,\r\n  Doch Wachstum und Gedeihen\r\n    Steht nicht in unserer Hand.\r\n    Alle gute Gabe\r\n    Kommt oben her, von Gott\r\n  Vom schönen blauen Himmel herab.\r\n\r\nMatthias Claudius, son of a Lutheran pastor in Germany, became\r\ndistinguished in journalism and literature. He studied theology with a\r\nview of entering the ministry; but through the influence of the\r\nrationalistic teachings in Germany at the time, he lost interest in\r\nreligion and decided to take up journalism. Later, stricken with a\r\ncritical illness, he realized the spiritual emptiness of the life he had\r\nbeen living, and again turned to his childhood faith. In the lyrics he\r\nwrote, though not composed as church hymns, there may be observed a\r\ntransition from the spiritual impoverishment of the rationalistic period\r\nto a new type of religious poetry giving expression to a turning once\r\nmore to the rugged faith of evangelicalism.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was translated by Jane Campbell, 1817-78, a successful teacher\r\nof music to children. She published a _Handbook for Singers_ in which\r\nare found the musical exercises the author used in her work with London\r\nchildren. The original hymn is in 17 four-line verses.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WIR PFLÜGEN appeared in _Lieder für Volksschulen_, a collection\r\nof melodies for public schools, published, 1800, in Hannover. It was set\r\nto an arrangement of verses 3-10 of Claudius’ song, with the chorus sung\r\nby peasants, altered to suit the melody. The hymn has ever since been\r\nextraordinarily popular throughout Germany. “The tune, in spite of its\r\nwide compass, has become one of the best known and favored of all hymn\r\ntunes, and fully deserves its popularity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n376.

Krehbiel_, 1869-1948\r\n\r\nBased on Jeremiah 33:11,\r\n\r\n  Give thanks to the Lord of hosts,\r\n  For the Lord is good,\r\n  For his kindness endures forever.\r\n                                                       (Am. Trans.)\r\n\r\n  Dankt dem Herrn! mit frohen Gaben\r\n    Füllet er das ganze Land!\r\n  Alles, Alles, was wir haben,\r\n    Kommt aus seiner Vaterhand.\r\n\r\n  Dankt dem Herrn! er giebt uns Leben\r\n    Giebt uns Nahrung und Gedeihn.\r\n  O wer wollt ihn nicht erheben\r\n    Und sich seiner Güte freun!\r\n\r\n  Dankt dem Herrn! vergisz, O Seele,\r\n    Deines guten Vaters nie!\r\n  Werd ihm ähnlich und erzähle\r\n    Seine Wunder spät und früh.\r\n\r\nThe author, Gottlob Nath. Fischer, was born at Graba, near Saalfeld. At\r\nthe time of his death he was head master of the cathedral school and\r\ncounselor of the consistory at Halberstadt.\r\n\r\nThe translation was made by C. E. Krehbiel, Mennonite minister and\r\neditor who was born at Summerfield, Ill., the son of Rev. Christian and\r\nSusanna Ruth Krehbiel. After completing his education at the\r\nPresbyterian Theological Seminary, Bloomfield, N. J., 1898-99, and in\r\nBerlin University, Germany, 1899-1901, Krehbiel became a member of the\r\nbusiness firm, The Herald Publishing Co., Newton, Kansas, serving in the\r\neditorial and business offices for a period of 20 years. He served as\r\neditor of _Der Christlicher Bundesbote_, 1930-46, and as president of\r\nthe General Conference of Mennonites for the two trienniums, 1935-41.\r\nKrehbiel was also a member of the committee that compiled the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ RINGE RECHT. For comments on this tune see Hymn 563.\r\n\r\n\r\n377. Come, ye thankful people, come              _Henry Alford_, 1810-71\r\n\r\nA popular and widely used hymn at harvest festivals, especially in\r\nEngland. It was first published under the title “After Harvest,” in\r\n1844. In 1867, it was revised by the author, the form here being this\r\nrevised version.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Henry Alford see Hymn 152.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. GEORGE’S WINDSOR has long been associated with these words,\r\nto which it is well suited in every way. Originally, however, the tune\r\nwas set to the hymn “Hark! the song of jubilee.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, George J. Elvey, see Hymn 118.\r\n\r\n\r\n378. To Thee, O Lord, our hearts we raise      _William Chatterdon Dix_,\r\n                                                                 1837-98\r\n\r\nA popular thanksgiving hymn, written in the author’s most facile and\r\nmusical style. The hymn was published in St. Raphael’s _Hymns for the\r\nService of the Church_, Bristol, 1864.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, William Chatterdon Dix, see Hymn 78.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. GALL is from _Katolisches Gesangbuch zum Gebrauch bei dem\r\nöffentlichen Gottesdienste_, 1863, the revised edition of the old hymn\r\nbook used in the Benedictine Monastery founded in 614 A.D. by the Irish\r\nmonk, St. Gall. It is a fine tune with a good swinging rhythm when sung\r\nat a fairly lively tempo.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NEW YEAR\r\n\r\n\r\n379. Ring out, wild bells                     _Alfred Tennyson_, 1809-92\r\n\r\nFrom Sec. 106 of the poem “In Memoriam” (See 149).\r\n\r\nAfter tracing his grief through successive Christmas celebrations, the\r\npoet bursts into this song of confident faith in God at the opening of\r\nthe new year. The poet turns from the past and rises above his private\r\ngrief to sing of the future and its hopes for mankind.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Alfred Tennyson see Hymn 149.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WILD BELLS was written for this poem by Henry Lahee, 1826-1912,\r\norganist at the Holy Trinity Church, Brompton, England, for about 30\r\nyears. Lahee, a versatile composer, won many prizes for his glees,\r\nmadrigals, and part songs.\r\n\r\nThe tune is very effective but too difficult for ordinary congregational\r\nsinging. It was included in the _Hymnary_ for use by singing groups\r\npreparing for special celebrations of New Year.\r\n\r\n\r\n380. Another year is dawning          _Frances Ridley Havergal_, 1836-79\r\n\r\nA prayer for the New Year, hailing its advent as another opportunity for\r\nprogress, service, and training in close fellowship with God.\r\n\r\nThe poem was written in five stanzas of four lines each as the text of a\r\nNew Year’s card and distributed by Miss Havergal among friends under the\r\ntitle, “A Happy New Year! Ever Such May It Be!”\r\n\r\nThe omitted fifth stanza reads:\r\n\r\n  Another year is dawning\r\n    Dear Father, let it be\r\n  On earth, or else in heaven\r\n    Another year for Thee.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Frances R. Havergal see Hymn 126.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CRUCIFIX, of anonymous composition, was taken from the _Hymns\r\nof the Spirit_, Boston: Beacon Press, 1938, where it is used as a second\r\ntune to Miss Havergal’s hymn.\r\n\r\n\r\n381. Another year of setting suns          _John W. Chadwick_, 1840-1904\r\n\r\nThis poem came from the Unitarian stream of hymnody which was so strong\r\nduring the middle of the nineteenth century. Chadwick, born at\r\nMarblehead, Mass., graduated from Harvard in 1864 and the following 40\r\nyears served as minister of the Second Unitarian Church in Brooklyn. He\r\nwrote biographies of Channing and Parker and is the author of\r\nconsiderable poetry. It has been noted that many of his hymns possess\r\nthe simplicity and spirit of the writings of Whittier, the Quaker poet,\r\nand might easily pass for his.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HOLY CROSS. The source of this tune is not clear. It is\r\nascribed in various hymnals to Thomas Hastings, to Mendelssohn, to John\r\nStainer, and to Mozart. James Love, who was well informed on English\r\nhymn tunes, says that it was adapted from an anonymous organ “Andante”\r\nwhich was said to be based on a theme by Mozart. The tune, in 3-4 time,\r\nappears in the _Methodist Hymnal_, 1935, the arrangement credited to\r\nJames C. Wade, an organist and conductor of choral groups, born in\r\nStaffordshire, England, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n382. The year is gone beyond recall                              _Latin_\r\n                                                _Tr. F. Pott_, 1832-1909\r\n\r\nFrom a Latin hymn, _Lapsus est annus_, found in a Breviary of Meaux,\r\n1713 and 1734. It was used for compline after the first vespers of the\r\nFestival of the Circumcision, which is the last office sung on December\r\n31. The original reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  Lapsus est annus: redit annus alter:\r\n  Vita sic mutis fugit acta pennis:\r\n  Tu, Deus, cursum moderaris, unus\r\n      Arbiter, aevi.\r\n\r\n  Gens tuis plaudit cumulata donis:\r\n  Te simul votis Dominum precatur,\r\n  Servet intactum fidei verendae\r\n      Patriae munus.\r\n\r\n  Supplices poscunt alimenta cives:\r\n  Finibus morbos patriis repellas:\r\n  Larga securae referas, benignus\r\n      Commoda pacis.\r\n\r\n  Postulant culpas venia relaxes:\r\n  Limites arctos vitiis reponas;\r\n  Past graves pugnas tua dat salubrem\r\n      Dextera palmam.\r\n\r\n  Noxiae vitae maculas perosi\r\n  Cor, Deus, nostrum tibi devovemus:\r\n  Da bonos annos, facilemque Patris\r\n      Indue vultum.\r\n\r\n  Dum dies currunt, redeunt et anni,\r\n  Et gradu certo sibi saecla cedunt,\r\n  Debitas laudes Triadi supremae\r\n      Concinat orbis.\r\n\r\nText from Daniel, H. A., _Thesaurus hymnologicus_, 5 vols.; Lipsiae:\r\n1855-1856, IV, 319.\r\n\r\nThe translation was made by Francis Pott, M. A., Curate of Ticehurst,\r\nSussex, and one of the editors of _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, London,\r\n1861. The original form of Pott’s translation appeared first in a hymnal\r\ncompiled by him, _Hymns Fitted to the Order of Common Prayer, etc._,\r\nLondon, 1864. It reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  The year is gone beyond recall;\r\n  ’Tis gone—with all its hopes and fears,\r\n  With all its joys for those new born,\r\n  With all its troubled mourners’ tears.\r\n\r\n  We thank Thee, Lord, for countless gifts,\r\n  For dangers we have passed unscathed;\r\n  We thank Thee for Thy Church preserved;\r\n  Oh! seal to us her ancient Faith.\r\n\r\n  Again we ask Thy goodness, Lord;\r\n  The coming year in mercy bless;\r\n  Guard Thou our land from pestilence;\r\n  And give us grace and plenteousness.\r\n\r\n  Forgive this nation’s many sins;\r\n  Destroy the strength that sin has gained;\r\n  And give us grace with sin to strive;\r\n  And give us crowns through strife attained.\r\n\r\n  We hate the sins that stain the past;\r\n  We would henceforth from them be free;\r\n  O grant us peaceful years, good Lord;\r\n  And we will spend them all to Thee.\r\n\r\n  We would that our good Father’s eye\r\n  Should look on us—but not in wrath;\r\n  And we, Thy children, year by year,\r\n  A purer song of praise pour forth. Amen.\r\n\r\nWhen the hymn was selected for _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, the\r\ntranslation was altered into its present form. The last stanza is\r\nomitted in the _Hymnary_. The English and Latin are published in _Hymns,\r\nAncient and Modern_, Historical Edition, London, Clowes, 1909.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ TALLIS, also called “Tallis’ Ordinal,” is from _The Whole\r\nPsalter translated into English Metre, which contayneth an hundreth and\r\nfifty Psalmes_, a work by Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nprinted about 1561. At the end of the book are nine tunes in four parts\r\nby Thomas Tallis. This is the last of the nine and is set to the version\r\nof _Veni Creator Spiritus_, which appears in the _English Prayer Book\r\nOrdinal_. The tune was evidently derived by Tallis from a 15th-century\r\nEnglish carol tune, “This endris Nyght”—for it is an adaptation to\r\ncommon time of the first two lines of this carol melody.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Thomas Tallis, see Hymn 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n383. Great God, we sing that mighty hand     _Philip Doddridge_, 1702-51\r\n\r\nA New Year’s hymn from the posthumous edition of Doddridge’s _Hymns\r\nfounded on various texts in the Holy Scriptures_, 1745, where it is\r\nheaded, “Help obtained from God. Acts 26:22. For the New Year.”\r\n\r\nIt is based on Acts 26:22: “Having therefore obtained help of God, I\r\ncontinue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none\r\nother things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should\r\ncome.”\r\n\r\nMost of Doddridge’s hymns were composed for use in his own congregation\r\nin connection with his sermons. None of them were published during his\r\nlife time.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Doddridge see Hymn 56.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GERMANY. For this tune see Hymn 222.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 WINTER\r\n\r\n\r\n384. ’Tis winter now                        _Samuel Longfellow_, 1819-92\r\n\r\nA “delicately etched winter hymn” which appeared in _Hymns of the\r\nSpirit_, 1864, by Samuel Longfellow and Samuel Johnson.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Samuel Longfellow, see Hymn 28.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MELROSE. For comments on the composer, Frederick C. Maker, see\r\nHymn 112. This combination of hymn and tune was made by the editors of\r\nthe _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SPRING\r\n\r\n\r\n385. The glory of the spring, how sweet        _Thomas Hornblower Gill_,\r\n                                                               1819-1906\r\n\r\nBased on Psalm 104:30: “... thou renewest the face of the earth,” and\r\nEphesians 4:23: “... be renewed in the spirit of your mind.”\r\n\r\nIt is an exquisite lyric, expressing not only the glory of the\r\nspringtime with its newborn life, but depicting also, with rare beauty\r\nand power, the renewal of life which God works in the soul—a new birth\r\nof faith and love, prayer and song. The author himself wrote that, as a\r\nresult of the study of the New Testament, “truth upon truth brake upon\r\nmy gaze and God put a new song into my mouth.”\r\n\r\nThomas Hornblower Gill, born in Birmingham, England, was brought up a\r\nUnitarian, but, unsatisfied with the Unitarian view of the person of\r\nChrist, he withdrew from that church and joined the Evangelical party in\r\nthe Church of England. One of the major influences leading him to this\r\ndecision was his study of the hymns of Isaac Watts. He saw “the contrast\r\nbetween their native force and fulness and their shrunken and dwindled\r\npresentation in the mutilated version in Unitarian hymnbooks.” Gill\r\npublished a number of books of poems which R. W. Dale, in compiling a\r\nhymnbook for his congregation at Carr’s Lane, Birmingham, found “a very\r\nmine of wealth.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ KING’S LANGLEY, “a delightfully gay tune,” is an arrangement of\r\na traditional English May-day carol. It appeared in the _English Hymnal_\r\nof 1906. The arrangement is by Miss L. E. Broadwood, an English lady of\r\nconsiderable musical talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SUMMER\r\n\r\n\r\n386. Summer suns are glowing                   _William W. How_, 1823-97\r\n\r\nOne of the most welcome of the hymns of the changing year. It was\r\nwritten for _Church Hymns_, 1871.\r\n\r\nThe author wrote a hymn for each of the four seasons, another appearing\r\nat No. 387.\r\n\r\nFor comments on W. W. How see Hymn 144.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ RUTH, composed by Samuel Smith, privately printed in 1865, was\r\nset to the present hymn in 1874 by Arthur Sullivan when he was editing\r\nthe music for _Church Hymns_.\r\n\r\nSamuel Smith, 1821-1917 (not to be confused with the author of “My\r\ncountry, ’tis of thee”), was an English organist, serving Trinity\r\nChurch, Windsor, for 34 years. He succeeded Sir George Elvey as\r\nconductor of the Windsor and Eton Choral Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 AUTUMN\r\n\r\n\r\n387. The year is swiftly waning                _William W. How_, 1823-97\r\n\r\nA hymn for the autumn season. Like No. 386, it was written for the\r\nauthor’s _Church Hymns_, 1871.\r\n\r\nFor comments on W. W. How see Hymn 144.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WAS KANN ES SCHÖN’RES GEBEN is from the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_\r\nwhere it appears anonymously, set to a hymn by Philipp Spitta, “Was kann\r\nes schön’res geben.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES\r\n\r\n\r\n388. Father of men, in whom are one           _Henry Cary Shuttleworth_,\r\n                                                               1850-1900\r\n\r\nA deeply sympathetic Christian hymn, written for the Friendly Societies\r\nof the Church of England, but may appropriately be used for many\r\noccasions of a more general character. It is especially useful in the\r\nlife of a college campus.\r\n\r\nThe author, Henry Cary Shuttleworth, was educated at Oxford for the\r\nAnglican ministry. He was a minor canon in St. Paul’s Cathedral,\r\n1876-84, and rector of St. Nicholas Cole Abbey, London, from 1883.\r\nConcerned for the poor and down-trodden of London, Shuttleworth became a\r\nprominent member of the Christian Social movement. For a time he was\r\nProfessor of Pastoral and Liturgical Theology in King’s College, London.\r\nAn able musician, he wrote many carols and hymns and published a book,\r\n_The Place of Music in Public Worship_. The present hymn appeared in the\r\nSt. Nicholas Cole Abbey _Hymnal Appendix_, 1897, and in the _Church\r\nMonthly_, 1898, with music by the author.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. LO is a unique melody, constructed on three phrases of\r\nthree measures each. It is a simple, diatonic tune, moving within the\r\npitch range of a sixth, with the third phrase a repetition of the first.\r\nIt should be sung in a quiet manner, and is well adapted for unison\r\nsinging. The tune, an old Breton melody, appeared in _School Worship_,\r\nLondon, 1926, from whence it was introduced into the _Presbyterian\r\nHymnal_ of 1935 and from thence to the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n389. O grant us light that we may know      _Lawrence Tuttiett_, 1825-97\r\n\r\nA prayer for the light from God to illuminate the mind in its search for\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe author wrote many of his hymns on returning from visiting the sick\r\nand bereaved, expressing in them thoughts of consolation for families in\r\nsorrow and trouble. That this hymn may have had a similar origin is\r\nindicated by the omitted Stanzas 4 and 5, which are as follows:\r\n\r\n  O grant us light, in grief and pain,\r\n    To lift our burdened hearts above,\r\n  And count the very cross a gain,\r\n    And bless our Father’s hidden love.\r\n\r\n  O grant us light, when, soon or late,\r\n    All earthly scenes shall pass away,\r\n  In Thee to find the open gate\r\n    To deathless home and endless day.\r\n\r\nLawrence Tuttiett, son of a surgeon in the English Royal Navy, at first\r\nintended to follow his father into the medical profession, but, after\r\nstudying at Christ’s Hospital and King’s College, London, he decided to\r\nbecome a minister. He was ordained in 1848 and devoted his life to the\r\nEpiscopal Church, ministering in various parishes in England and\r\nScotland. His publications include _Hymns for Churchmen_, 1854; _Hymns\r\nfor Children of the Church_, 1862; and _Gems of Thought on the Sunday\r\nServices_, 1864. The present hymn appeared in the last-named\r\npublication.\r\n\r\n_Music._ CANONBURY. For comments on this tune see Hymn 296.\r\n\r\n\r\n390. Almighty Lord, with one accord        _Melancthon Woolsey Stryker_,\r\n                                                               1851-1929\r\n\r\n“A College Hymn” was the title given this poem, first printed in _The\r\nNew York Evangelist_, February 27, 1896. It was included in _The College\r\nHymnal_, New York, the same year and in the _Methodist Hymnal_ of 1905.\r\n\r\nThe author, Melancthon Woolsey Stryker, a prominent Presbyterian\r\nminister, was educated at Hamilton College, New York, and Auburn\r\nTheological Seminary. After serving churches in Auburn and Ithaca, New\r\nYork; Holyoke, Mass.; and Chicago, Ill., he became president of his Alma\r\nMater, Hamilton College. A student of hymnology, he compiled several\r\nhymnals and books of sacred songs.\r\n\r\nThe hymn is appropriately used for commencement programs at Christian\r\ncolleges. On such occasions it is often sung to the familiar tune\r\n“Azmon” (397).\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PATTEN was written for this hymn for use in _The Methodist\r\nHymnal_, 1905. The composer, Peter C. Lutkin, 1858-1931, the youngest of\r\nsix children, was born of Danish parents, at Thompsonville, Wis., March\r\n27, 1858. He was only a lad when both his parents died, shortly after\r\nthe family had moved to Chicago. His ability at the organ and his\r\nsuccess as boy soloist at the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral in Chicago\r\nopened to him attractive opportunities for the study of music, and he\r\nadvanced rapidly. After teaching piano at Northwestern University for\r\nseveral years, he left for Europe to study music in Berlin, Paris, and\r\nVienna, returning after four years to Chicago where he held various\r\npositions as organist and choirmaster. In 1896, he organized the\r\nNorthwestern University School of Music and was given the title of\r\n“Dean.” An authority in the field of church music and hymnology, Dean\r\nLutkin did much through his teaching and writing to raise the standards\r\nof music throughout all the churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 YOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\n391. I feel the winds of God today                 _Jessie Adams_, 1863—\r\n\r\nFor many years the authorship of this hymn was unknown since the writer\r\npreferred to remain anonymous. It finally came to light that the lines\r\nwere penned by Miss Jessie Adams, a member of the Society of Friends in\r\nEngland. She was a progressive teacher and a leader of the local Adult\r\nSchool at Frimley, England, where she long resided. Miss Adams wrote the\r\nhymn after a long period of service as teacher in which she felt a\r\nconsiderable measure of disappointment and failure, as if tugging and\r\nlaboring at the oars of a boat without making much headway. She wrote:\r\n\r\n  If then, quitting the labors at the oars, we humbly believe that God’s\r\n  Spirit still leads us aright, we shall pass the point of danger and\r\n  helplessness. Some little act of kindness may be as the upturned sail\r\n  which that spirit waits to fill, in spite of past and future.\r\n\r\nThe message of the hymn is for our time. Many in our day labor at the\r\noars, in their own strength, only to find themselves worn and\r\ndiscouraged. Progress comes by lifting the sails and permitting the\r\ninvisible power of God to carry life forward.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HARDY NORSEMEN is an anonymous Norse melody, the origin of\r\nwhich has not been traced. It is a popular tune among the Dutch\r\nMennonites where it is often sung at their young people’s gatherings.\r\n\r\n\r\n392. “Are ye able,” said the Master                _Earl Marlatt_, 1892—\r\n\r\nWritten for a consecration service at Boston University School of\r\nReligious Education, in 1926, where the author was Professor of\r\nReligious Education.\r\n\r\nIt is based on Jesus’ question of James and John, and their answer: “Are\r\nye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized\r\nwith the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto Him, Lord, we\r\nare able” (Matt. 20:22).\r\n\r\nThe second verse came to the author’s mind as a result of seeing the\r\nPassion Play at Oberammergau, where he was greatly moved by the scene\r\nwhere the dying thief turned to Jesus and said, “Remember me when Thou\r\ncontest into Thy Kingdom.” “As Anton Lang, playing the part of Christ,\r\nsaid, ‘Today, shalt thou be with me in paradise,’” the author writes,\r\n“Immortality suddenly became as real to me as the sunlight at that\r\nmoment driving the clouds from the mountains, and I knew that nothing,\r\nnothing could ever shake my faith in that vision.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written for the tune “Beacon Hill.” The combination of\r\nwords and tune was adopted as one of the school songs of Boston\r\nUniversity School of Theology, whose students have carried it all over\r\nthe world. It was incorporated into the _Methodist Hymnal_ of 1935, from\r\nwhence it came into the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\nEarl Bowman Marlatt, son of a Methodist minister, was born at Columbus,\r\nIndiana. He graduated from De Pauw University and then studied at Boston\r\nUniversity, Harvard, Oxford, and the University of Berlin, becoming\r\nProfessor of Philosophy at Boston University in 1923 and later Professor\r\nof Religious Education in that institution.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BEACON HILL received its name from Beacon Hill, Boston, where\r\nMarlatt resided when he wrote the words for this tune. The composer,\r\nHarry Silvernale Mason, born in 1881, was a student at Boston University\r\nwhen he wrote the tune. He is now serving as instructor in Fine Arts in\r\nReligion at Auburn Theological Seminary, Auburn, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n393. Just as I am, Thine own to be           _Marianne Hearn_, 1834-1909\r\n\r\nA young people’s consecration hymn, contributed to _The Voice of\r\nPraise_, 1887, published by the Sunday School Union of London. Verses 5\r\nand 6, omitted here, read as follows:\r\n\r\n  With many dreams of fame and gold,\r\n  Success and joy to make me bold,\r\n  But dearer still my faith to hold,\r\n    For my whole life I come.\r\n\r\n  And for Thy sake to win renown,\r\n  And then to take the victor’s crown,\r\n  And at Thy feet to cast it down,\r\n    O Master, Lord, I come.\r\n\r\nIt was written by an Englishwoman, Marianne Hearn (_nom de plume_,\r\nMarianne Farningham), who, in early life, was a teacher in the primary\r\nschools, and later became a successful writer of articles for various\r\nperiodicals, including _The Christian Herald_, published by James Clarke\r\nand Co. For a time she edited the London _Sunday School Times_. Miss\r\nHearn published a half dozen or more volumes of poetry and an\r\nautobiography, _A Working Woman’s Life_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ JUST AS I AM. For comments on the composer, Joseph Barnby, see\r\nHymn 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n394. Savior, while my heart is tender        _John Burton, the younger_,\r\n                                                                 1803-77\r\n\r\nA hymn of dedication to Christian service, suitable for use with young\r\npeople’s groups.\r\n\r\nThe author, John Burton, usually called “the younger” to distinguish him\r\nfrom another English hymn writer of the same name, was born and died in\r\nStratford, England. From his 15th to 25th year he suffered greatly from\r\nill health but recovered sufficiently to spend the next 50 years in\r\nbusiness as a cooper and basket-maker in his home town. A devout\r\nCongregationalist, he served as deacon in his church and as a Sunday\r\nschool teacher for 27 years. While visiting a poor chimney sweeper, he\r\ncontracted small pox and died of that disease. He published several\r\nvolumes of religious works, including _One Hundred Original Hymns for\r\nthe Young_, 1850, in which the present hymn is found.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LILLE is an old French melody, the origin of which has not been\r\ntraced.\r\n\r\n(Correction: second last soprano note in the first score should be on B,\r\nnot A as in the earlier editions of the _Hymnary_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n395. Savior, like a shepherd lead us     _Dorothy Ann Thrupp_, 1779-1847\r\n\r\nPublished anonymously in the author’s _Hymns for the Young_, 1836.\r\nDorothy Ann Thrupp was born and reared in London where she spent all her\r\nlife. She had a special gift for writing hymns suited to the worship\r\nexperiences of children. A modest person, always avoiding personal\r\npublicity. Miss Thrupp did not always receive full credit for her work.\r\nThis hymn is sometimes wrongly credited to H. F. Lyte.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BRADBURY was written for this hymn and derives its name from\r\nthe composer. It first appeared in a popular Sunday school book,\r\n_Oriola_, published in 1859 by W. B. Bradbury.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, W. B. Bradbury, see Hymn 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n396. O Son of man, our hero                  _Frank Fletcher_, 1870-1936\r\n\r\nA hymn deeply sympathetic with the aspirations and needs of young\r\nChristians, and appealing to the heroism of youth.\r\n\r\nFrank Fletcher was Head Master of Charterhouse School, Godalming,\r\nEngland, the first layman elected to such a position. He wrote these\r\nwords in 1921, while on a motor drive between London and Charterhouse.\r\nAfter having been sung for some time in Charterhouse School, the poem\r\nwas sent to a church newspaper, _The Challenge_, and from thence it\r\nfound its way into the hymnals of England and America. The word “mate”\r\nin the last line comes from an explanation of the trinity given by a\r\nBishop in answer to a working man’s question on that subject: “God our\r\nFather, God our Brother, God our Mate.” Fletcher heard the Bishop give\r\nthis answer and the phrase stuck in his mind.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LONDONDERRY, the famous Irish traditional melody, is a tune\r\nwhich every congregation loves to sing. It rises gradually and skilfully\r\nto an effective climax near the end. The tune, unfortunately, has\r\nsuffered at the hands of arrangers who have employed it, with various\r\ndegrees of merit, for many different combinations of voices and\r\ninstruments. Its appropriateness for church use is questioned only by\r\nthose who have long associated it with secular words and occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n397. Lord in the fulness of my might           _Thomas Hornblower Gill_,\r\n                                                               1819-1906\r\n\r\nA consecration hymn for young people, much used in schools and colleges.\r\nIt was written by Gill in 1855 and published in his _Golden Chain of\r\nPraise_, 1869, under the title, “Early Love. ‘How good it is to close\r\nwith Christ betimes!’ Oliver Cromwell.” The original poem has eight\r\nstanzas.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Thomas Hornblower Gill see Hymn 385.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ AZMON. For comments on this tune see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n398. Shepherd of eager youth      _Clement of Alexandria_, _c._ 170-_c._\r\n                                                                     220\r\n                                          _Tr. Henry M. Dexter_, 1821-90\r\n\r\nA hymn to Christ, based on a Greek poem attributed to Clement of\r\nAlexandria, beginning with the line\r\n\r\n  Στόµιον πώλων ἀδαῶν.\r\n\r\nThe poem is one of two which Clement attached to his book, _The Tutor_.\r\nSome say it is the earliest Christian hymn extant. (But see comments on\r\nHymn 34).\r\n\r\nTitus Flavius Clemens, known as St. Clement of Alexandria, _c._ 170-_c._\r\n220, remains something of an enigmatic figure in church history. It is\r\nnot known where or exactly when he was born. He was a pagan philosopher\r\nin his younger days. After his conversion to Christianity, he became\r\nhead of the Cathedral School at Alexandria, then the center of Christian\r\nscholarship. Here he remained until A.D. 203 when he was driven out by\r\npersecution under Septimus Severus. Clement then became a wanderer and\r\nnothing is known of his later life.\r\n\r\nHenry Martyn Dexter was a graduate of Yale and Andover Theological\r\nSeminary, a Congregational minister and editor. He translated the text\r\nof Clement’s hymn into prose and then made a free rendering of it into\r\nverse, in 1846. The hymn was written for use in a service in Dexter’s\r\nchurch in which he preached on the text, Deut. 32:7: “Remember the days\r\nof old,” his sermon topic being, “Some Prominent Characteristics of the\r\nEarly Christians.”\r\n\r\nHymnbook editors have made a few changes in the text: “eager youth” for\r\n“tender youth” in the first stanza; and “let all the holy throng” for\r\n“infants and the glad throng” in Stanza 4. The third stanza, omitted\r\nhere, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  Thou art the great High Priest;\r\n  Thou hast prepared the feast\r\n    Of holy love;\r\n  And in our mortal pain\r\n  None calls on Thee in vain;\r\n  Help Thou dost not disdain,\r\n    Help from above.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ KIRBY BEDON was composed by Edward Bunnett, 1834-1923, a\r\nprominent English organist and composer of church music. The tune first\r\nappeared in _The Congregational Hymnary_ of the Congregational Union of\r\nEngland and Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n399. Lead on, O King Eternal            _Ernest W. Shurtleff_, 1862-1917\r\n\r\nWritten upon request of the author’s classmates at Andover Theological\r\nSeminary, as a hymn for their graduation in 1887. It has come into wide\r\nuse as a processional and a recessional on baccalaureate and other\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nErnest W. Shurtleff, graduate of Harvard University and Andover\r\nTheological Seminary, held Congregational pastorates in Massachusetts\r\nand at Minneapolis, Minn. He then went to Frankfurt, Germany, where he\r\ndid his finest work as founder and pastor of the American Church at that\r\nplace. He also served as spiritual counselor to a large group of\r\nAmerican students in Paris. During the first World War, he and his wife\r\nwere active in relief work in Europe. Besides his gifts as preacher, and\r\npastor, Shurtleff also possessed ability as musician and writer, and\r\npublished several volumes of poetry.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LANCASHIRE. For comments on this tune see Hymn 115.\r\n\r\n\r\n400. Give of your best to the Master            _Howard B. Grose_, 1851—\r\n\r\nA challenge to youth to give heart and strength to the service of the\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\nThe author, Howard B. Grose, was born in Millerton, N. Y. After\r\ngraduating from the University of Rochester, he served successively as\r\npastor of the First Baptist Church, Poughkeepsie, N. Y., the First\r\nBaptist Church, Pittsburgh, Pa.; president of the University of South\r\nDakota; and teacher of history in the University of Chicago. In 1910 he\r\nbecame editor of the Baptist magazine, _Missions_. He was a leader in\r\nthe Christian Endeavor movement and wrote this hymn for a Christian\r\nEndeavor hymnal that he was then editing.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BARNARD was composed by Charlotte A. (Mrs. Charles C.) Barnard,\r\n1820-69, an Englishwoman who after her marriage in 1851 began composing\r\nsongs and ballads under the pseudonym of “Claribel.” These were very\r\npopular in their day. She composed a hymn tune, “Brocklesbury,” which is\r\nwidely used with the hymn, “Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me.”\r\n\r\nThe descant was written by Professor W. H. Hohmann, head of the music\r\ndepartment of Bethel College. The “descant” is an old variation in the\r\nuse of tunes. It consists of a second melody over that of the tune and\r\nis to be sung by a few sopranos. It is only an embellishment and should\r\nbe no more than audible, otherwise it will detract from the melody which\r\nshould remain as the main center of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n401. Father in heav’n who lovest all        _Rudyard Kipling_, 1865-1936\r\n\r\n“The Children’s Hymn,” in Kipling’s _Puck of Pook’s Hill_, published in\r\n1906. It was written for boys, but is suitable also for adults.\r\nPermission to use the hymn in the _Hymnary_ was granted by Mrs. Kipling\r\non condition that all eight stanzas, unaltered, be used.\r\n\r\nRudyard Kipling, famous English writer, was born in Bombay, India, and\r\ndied in Sussex, England. After receiving his education in England, he\r\nreturned to India to engage in journalism and became widely known for\r\nhis short stories, novels, children’s books, histories, and books of\r\ntravel. The Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded him in 1907, and he\r\nreceived honorary degrees from universities all over the world. His\r\n_Jungle Book_, _Just-So Stories_, _Puck of Pook’s Hill_, _Rewards and\r\nFairies_ made him beloved of all children. His writings extol the\r\nvirtues of clean living and manly duty which make a nation great.\r\nHowever, his passionate patriotism made him pen the unfortunate lines:\r\n\r\n  “O East is East and West is West\r\n    And ne’er the twain shall meet”\r\n\r\na prophecy completely discredited by the world events of recent years.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HEBRON. For comments on Lowell Mason, the composer of this\r\ntune, see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n402. Lord, through changing days, unchanging   _W. Russell Bowie_, 1882—\r\n\r\nThis hymn was written originally for the hymn book of the Hill School,\r\nof Pottstown, Pa., from which the author graduated as a boy in 1900, and\r\nwhere he afterward taught for a year. The motto of the school is\r\n“Whatsoever things are true” (Phil. 4:8). The hymn is built around that\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\nW. Russell Bowie was born in Richmond, Va. After taking an A.B. and an\r\nA.M. at Harvard and teaching for a year at the Hill School, he spent\r\nmost of three years at the Theological Seminary of Virginia, near\r\nAlexandria, graduating with the B.D. degree in 1908. Part of his senior\r\nyear was spent in special study at Union Theological Seminary in New\r\nYork. For many years he was rector of Grace Church (Episcopal) in New\r\nYork, a post he resigned in 1939 to become Jesup Graduate Professor of\r\nPractical Theology and Dean of Students at Union Seminary. He is the\r\nauthor of a number of books, the most widely known of which is the\r\n_Story of the Bible_, published by the Abingdon-Cokesbury Press. Among\r\nhis other volumes are _The Children’s Year_, _The Inescapable Christ_,\r\n_The Master: A Life of Christ_ (1928) and _Which Way Ahead_ (1943). In\r\nthe late 1920’s he was elected Bishop Coadjutor of Pennsylvania, but did\r\nnot accept.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ REGENT SQUARE. For comments on this tune see Hymn 81.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK II\r\n                           Hymns for Children\r\n\r\n\r\n403. A gladsome hymn of praise we sing          _Ambrose N. Blatchford_,\r\n                                                               1842-1924\r\n\r\nWritten by the pastor of the Lewin’s Mead Unitarian Church, Bristol,\r\nEngland, for use in a Sunday school anniversary, 1876, in his church.\r\nThe hymn is suitable for adults as well as for children.\r\n\r\nAmbrose N. Blatchford, born in Devonshire, England, was educated at\r\nTavistock Grammar School and Manchester New College, London. After\r\nserving as assistant minister at Lewin’s Mead Unitarian Church for ten\r\nyears, he took full charge in 1876 and continued until his retirement in\r\n1915, an unusual record of nearly 50 years of service in one church. He\r\nwas a man of sympathy with all classes of people, possessed unusual\r\nvitality, and was a trusted friend and pastor. Blatchford was interested\r\nin the life and progress of the community and became one of the most\r\ninfluential and most-loved men in the city.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CANAAN. The tune was taken from the _Hymnary_ of the United\r\nChurch of Canada. The composer is unknown. It is a good, fluent melody\r\nconstructed on a straightforward melodic line which is repeated three\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n404. Children of Jerusalem                        _John Henley_, 1800-42\r\n\r\nA children’s hymn of praise, based on Matthew 21:15-16:\r\n\r\n  And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that\r\n  he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to\r\n  the son of David; they were sore displeased, and said unto him,\r\n  Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye\r\n  not read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected\r\n  praise?\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written by Rev. John Henley, an English Methodist minister,\r\nknown widely for his deep spirituality and entire consecration to\r\nChrist. Henley gave much of his time and energy in behalf of the\r\nsuffering and poor in his parishes.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ INFANT PRAISE, also known as “Children of Jerusalem,” first\r\nappeared in John Curwen’s _Tune Book to the Hymns and Chants for Sunday\r\nSchools_, published in 1842. The hymn and tune appeared a year later in\r\n_The Juvenile Harmonist: A Selection of Tunes and Pieces for Children_,\r\nby Thomas Clark of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nJohn Curwen, 1816-80, was a minister in the Independent Church in\r\nEngland, and an ardent advocate of congregational singing. He developed\r\nand promoted the Tonic Sol-Fa method of teaching to sing, using it in\r\nhis own church and schools, and lecturing upon it in various parts of\r\nthe country. Resigning his ministry on account of ill health, in 1867,\r\nhe established a printing and publishing business and assisted in the\r\nfounding of a Tonic Sol-Fa Association for the promotion of that method\r\nof singing. Curwen compiled and edited popular collections of songs for\r\nuse in Sunday schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n405. Around the throne of God in heaven         _Anne Shepherd_, 1809-57\r\n\r\nThe author of this hymn was born on the Isle of Wight, the daughter of\r\nRev. Edward H. Houlditch, a minister in the Church of England. In 1843\r\nshe married S. Saville Shepherd. The hymn, originally in five stanzas,\r\nis one of 64 hymns written by Mrs. Shepherd and published in 1836 under\r\nthe title, _Hymns Adapted to the Comprehension of Young Minds_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GLORY was published in England in Curwen’s _Tune Book to the\r\nHymns and Chants for Sunday Schools_, 1842, with these words. The\r\ncombination of hymn and tune has continued to the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NATURE\r\n\r\n\r\n406. A little seed lay fast asleep             _Clara Writer_, 1859-1915\r\n\r\nA song of growth under God’s daily care.\r\n\r\nThe lyric is a poetic description of the development of a seed from its\r\nfirst awakening to life under the touch of God’s sunshine, to the tall,\r\nfair plant with its golden ear of corn.\r\n\r\nNo biographical information is at hand concerning the author, Clara\r\nWriter.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ KING’S LANGLEY. For comments on this tune see Hymn 385.\r\n\r\n\r\n407. See the shining dewdrops                                _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nNo information is at hand concerning the origin of this children’s poem\r\non the theme, “God is good.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The melody appeared anonymously in _Kleiner Liederschatz_, a\r\nsmall but useful book of songs for use in German schools and homes. The\r\nbook was compiled and edited by several Kansas teachers and school\r\nfriends who preferred to withhold their names. It was first published in\r\n1901, Newton, Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement was made especially for the _Hymnary_, by E. Shippen\r\nBarnes, in 1939.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Barnes see Hymn 48.\r\n\r\n\r\n408. God sees the little sparrow fall            _Maria Straub_, 1838-98\r\n\r\nA hymn of God’s love, based on Jesus’ teaching that God notes the fall\r\nof the sparrow and arrays the flowers in beauty and loveliness.\r\n\r\nNo information has been traced concerning the author, Maria Straub, or\r\nher contemporary, S. W. Straub, 1842-99, who composed the music.\r\n\r\n\r\n409. Birds are singing, woods are ringing                   _L. F. Cole_\r\n\r\nA joyous song of praise. No information has been found concerning L. F.\r\nCole, author of the words.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune, BIRDS ARE SINGING, is anonymous.\r\n\r\n\r\n410. All things bright and beautiful          _Cecil Frances Alexander_,\r\n                                                               1823-1895\r\n\r\nA nature song. It was written, as were Hymns 104, “There is a green hill\r\nfar away,” and 412, “Once in royal David’s city,” to illustrate the\r\nApostle’s Creed, the present being a comment on the phrase, “Maker of\r\nheaven and earth.” It is based on Gen. 1:31: “And God saw everything\r\nthat He had made, and, behold, it was very good.”\r\n\r\nOne of her stanzas,\r\n\r\n  The rich man in his castle\r\n    The poor man at his gate;\r\n  God made them high and lowly\r\n    And ordered their estate\r\n\r\nis omitted in most hymn books because it is obviously not in keeping\r\nwith Christian teachings concerning wealth and poverty. (_Cf._ the\r\nParable of Dives and Lazarus). The author grew up in the wealthy\r\natmosphere of an Irish estate where her father was a land agent.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Mrs. Alexander see Hymn 104.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GREYSTONE. The first stanza, which serves as a “refrain,” is to\r\nbe sung after each verse. The hymn is an interesting study in metre. In\r\nthe refrain, the first line is trochaic (— -), but the second changes to\r\nthe more common iambic (- —). The tune is written to take care of this.\r\nIt owes its unique effect to this refrain, which keeps coming in with\r\nthis change of metre accompanied by a change of key from C to G.\r\n\r\nNo information is at hand concerning the composer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHRISTMAS\r\n\r\n\r\n411. The happy Christmas comes once more      _Nikolai F. S. Grundtvig_,\r\n                                                               1783-1872\r\n\r\nA charmingly fresh Christmas hymn written by the greatest of Danish hymn\r\nwriters. An omitted stanza reads:\r\n\r\n  O let us go with quiet mind,\r\n    The gentle Babe with shepherds find,\r\n  To gaze on him who gladdens them,\r\n    The loveliest flower of Jesse’s stem.\r\n\r\nNikolai F. S. Grundtvig was born in Udby, Denmark, 1783, the son of a\r\nLutheran pastor. He lived in a day when rationalistic “new theology” had\r\ndried up the stream of spirituality in the church. The church worship\r\nhad lost its evangelical glow, and the sermons had deteriorated into\r\nlectures on science and domestic economy. Young Grundtvig, in the course\r\nof his studies for the ministry, had come under the influence of this\r\nrationalism and for a time lost all interest in religion. Various\r\ninfluences opened his eyes to the spiritual poverty existing in the\r\nchurch, and he became an indefatigable worker for the dawn of a new day\r\nin the life of the people. His zeal sometimes led him into extravagances\r\nwhich put him at odds with his fellow ministers, but his preaching and\r\nwritings, nevertheless, became a powerful influence in Denmark and\r\nresulted in fresh stirring of the Spirit in the church. His poems and\r\nhymns, entitled _Hymns and Spiritual Songs_, were published in five\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The melody is found in a book, _Children’s Voices_, published\r\nby the Augsburg Press (Lutheran). No information is at hand regarding\r\nthe composer, C. Belle. The arrangement was made by E. Shippen Barnes\r\nfor the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Barnes see Hymn 48.\r\n\r\n\r\n412. Once in royal David’s city       _Cecil Frances Alexander_, 1823-95\r\n\r\nOne of a series of children’s songs written by Mrs. Alexander to\r\nillustrate the Apostles’ Creed, this being a comment on the second\r\nclause, “And in Jesus Christ his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived\r\nby the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary.” Others in the series are\r\n“There is a green hill far away” (No. 104) and “All things bright and\r\nbeautiful” (No. 410).\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ IRBY was written for this hymn to be sung by voices in unison,\r\nwith harmonized accompaniment. It has become one of the best-known hymn\r\ntunes for children, and is always associated with these words.\r\n\r\nHenry John Gauntlett, 1805-76, the composer, was an English musician who\r\ngave up law in 1844 to devote himself to music. He became a noted\r\norganist and prolific composer, his tunes running into thousands. He was\r\nmuch in demand for editing the music of hymn books and made a notable\r\ncontribution to the promotion of hymnody of the church. Mendelssohn said\r\nof him: “His literary attainments, his knowledge of the history of\r\nmusic, his acquaintance with acoustical laws, his marvelous memory, his\r\nphilosophical turn of mind, as well as his practical experience,\r\nrendered him one of the most remarkable professors of the age.”\r\n\r\n\r\n413. Come hither, ye children             _Christian Schmidt_, 1768-1854\r\n\r\nA popular Christmas song which all children love to sing.\r\n\r\nChristian Schmidt was born in Dinkelsbühl, the oldest son of the city\r\nclerk. In 1791, he was ordained to the ministry and given the headship\r\nof the school and made school inspector in Thannhausen at Mindel. His\r\nwas a singularly fruitful ministry in which he devoted most of his\r\ntalent to the benefit of the young people. He was in the habit of using\r\nthe hours from four until eight in the morning in writing for young\r\npeople, this being the only time of the day that he considered his own.\r\nAs a child of ten years, he was greatly impressed with the nativity\r\nscenes which had been built in the corridors of the state church in\r\nDinkelsbühl and which he saw daily during the Advent season. The vivid\r\nrecollection of this childhood experience resulted in the composition of\r\nthis beloved Christmas song for children:\r\n\r\n  Ihr Kinderlein, kommet, o kommet doch all’!\r\n    Zur Krippe her kommet, in Bethlehems Stall,\r\n  Und seht, was in dieser hoch-heiligen Nacht\r\n    Der Vater im Himmel für Freude uns macht.\r\n\r\n  O seht in der Krippe, im nächtlichen Stall,\r\n    Seht hier bei des Lichtleins hellglänzendem Strahl,\r\n  In reinlichen Windeln das himmlische Kind,\r\n    Viel schöner und holder als Engel es sind.\r\n\r\n  O betet: du liebes, du göttliches Kind,\r\n    Was leidest du Alles für unsere Sünd’!\r\n  Ach, hier in der Krippe schon Armut und Not,\r\n    Am Kreuze dort endlich den bitteren Tod!\r\n\r\n  Was geben wir Kinder, was schenken wir dir,\r\n    Du bestes und liebstes der Kinder, dafür?\r\n  Nichts willst du von Schätzen und Reichtum der Welt;\r\n    Ein Herz nur voll Demut allein dir gefällt.\r\n\r\nOur translation, appearing anonymously, employs the first stanza and two\r\nothers from the original not given here.\r\n\r\nThe poem first appeared in the second edition of _Christliche Gesänge\r\nzur öffentlichen Gottesverehrung_, Augsburg, 1811.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ IHR KINDERLEIN KOMMET should be sung with lively tempo. No\r\ninformation is at hand concerning the composer of the tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n414. Away in a manger                                        _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nA beautiful Christmas carol which has long been ascribed to Martin\r\nLuther. However, many of our best hymnologists—among them Percy Dearmer,\r\nJames Moffatt, and Robert McCutchan—hold that it has never been traced\r\nto any of Luther’s works, and that it does not resemble anything that\r\nLuther ever wrote. The words must, therefore, be classed “anonymous”\r\nuntil more information is forthcoming.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The music, too, is of unknown origin. The name of the composer,\r\nCarl Mueller, to whom it is attributed, is German and the tune is in the\r\nstyle of a German folk song. Other than this there seems to be no\r\ninformation regarding the composer or the tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 EASTER\r\n\r\n\r\n415. Joy dawned again on Easter Day                              _Latin_\r\n                                         _Tr. John Mason Neale_, 1818-66\r\n\r\nThe Latin original of this hymn comprises stanzas 9, 10, and 11 of\r\n_Aurora lucis rutilat_, one of the most ancient Easter hymns in\r\nexistence. It is found in the earliest monastic hymnaries of the sixth\r\nto the ninth centuries with a wide diffusion in continental as well as\r\nAnglo-Saxon and Celtic sources. Its authorship is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe Latin text may be found in _Analecta Hymnica Medii Aevi_, v. 51, p.\r\n89; A. S. Walpole, _Early Latin Hymns_, Cambridge University Press,\r\n1922, p. 356; or _Hymns Ancient and Modern, Historical Edition_, London:\r\nClowes, 1909, p. 199.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Aurora lucis rutilat_\r\n\r\n                               Stanza  9.\r\n  Claro paschali gaudio\r\n  Sol mundo nitet radio,\r\n  Cum Christum iam apostoli\r\n  Visu cernunt corporeo.\r\n\r\n                                  10.\r\n  Ostensa sibi vulnera\r\n  In Christi carne fulgida\r\n  Resurexisse Dominum\r\n  Voce fatentur publica.\r\n\r\n                                  11.\r\n  Rex Christe clementissime,\r\n  Tu corda nostra posside,\r\n  Ut tibi laudes debitas\r\n  Reddamus omni tempore.\r\n\r\n                                Doxology\r\n  Quaesumus, auctor omnium,\r\n  In hoc paschali gaudio\r\n  Ab omni mortis impetu\r\n  Tuum defendas populum.\r\n\r\n  Gloria tibi, Domine,\r\n  Qui surrexisti a mortuis,\r\n  Cum Patre et sancto Spiritu\r\n  In sempiterna saecula.\r\n\r\nThe full hymn was used at first as a morning hymn throughout the Easter\r\nseason. Later it was broken up into parts for various services during\r\nthe day, as follows: _Aurora lucis rutilat_, stanzas 1-4; _Tristes erant\r\napostoli_, stanzas 5-8; _Claro paschali gaudio_, stanzas 9-11. A\r\ntraditional double doxology of two stanzas which varies in form but\r\nwhich is always present, completes the third hymn. The subject matter\r\nfollows the Biblical narrative of the events of Easter morning.\r\n\r\nThe entire hymn was translated by John Mason Neale, _Collected Poems of\r\nJohn Mason Neale_, London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1914, pp. 121-122, and\r\npublished in _The Hymnal Noted_, in 1852. The full translation which has\r\nbeen greatly altered may also be found in _Hymns Ancient and Modern_,\r\npp. 198-199, in a traditional form.\r\n\r\nThose who sing this hymn at Eastertide may be assured that it has been\r\nin unbroken use for fourteen centuries, a universal expression of the\r\nseason’s unchanging faith and joy.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PUER NOBIS. For comments on this tune see Hymn 87.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LOYALTY AND CONSECRATION\r\n\r\n\r\n416. Hushed was the evening hymn               _James D. Burns_, 1823-64\r\n\r\nBased on the incident of the call of Samuel in I Samuel 3. The verses\r\nwere published in _The Evening Hymn_, 1857, a small volume consisting of\r\nan original hymn and an original prayer for every evening of the month,\r\nby Burns when he was minister of the Hampstead Presbyterian Church,\r\nLondon. The hymn lends itself well to dramatization.\r\n\r\nJames Drummond Burns received his training for the ministry at the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh. When the Disruption took place in the Scottish\r\nChurch, he followed his teacher, Dr. Chalmers, into the Free Church in\r\n1843. For reasons of health he went to France and some years later, his\r\nhealth improved, he returned to London and built up a strong\r\ncongregation at Hampstead where a church had been newly organized. His\r\nwinsome character and broadmindedness, together with an especially\r\nbeautiful voice, made his work unusually effective. He published several\r\nbooks and is the author of an article on “Hymns” in the eighth edition\r\nof the _Encyclopaedia Brittanica_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SAMUEL was composed for this hymn, the original arrangement,\r\nmade in 1874, being for treble voices in unison, with organ\r\naccompaniment. The composer later made the present four-part arrangement\r\nin which form it has come into many church hymnals.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Arthur Sullivan see Hymn 113.\r\n\r\n\r\n417. In our work and our play      _Whitefield Glanville Wills_, 1841-91\r\n\r\nA beautiful prayer of consecration.\r\n\r\nThe author, Whitefield Glanville Wills, an Englishman, was born in\r\nBristol. He published a small collection, _Hymns for Occasional Use_ in\r\n1881. The present hymn, entitled “Children of God,” was contributed by\r\nhim to _School Hymns_, England, 1891.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ROSSLYN is an English melody taken from the Supplement to the\r\n_Primitive Methodist Hymnal_, 1912. The composer is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n418. The wise may bring their learning                       _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nA hymn setting forth the important lesson that children, however poor,\r\nmay bring useful gifts to the King. It appeared anonymously in _The Book\r\nof Praise for Children_, published in England, 1881.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ELLON is a perfectly adapted tune for these words, though it\r\nwas written originally for another hymn. The tune is popular with\r\nchildren and is sung with interest also by adults.\r\n\r\nThe composer, George F. Root, 1820-95, an American musician, studied\r\nmusic in Boston and then became a teacher and organist. In 1841, he\r\nbecame associated with Lowell Mason in teaching music in the public\r\nschools of Boston. Three years later he moved to New York, where he\r\ntaught in various institutions, including Union Theological Seminary and\r\nthe New York Institution for the Blind. In the latter place, the blind\r\nhymn writer, Fanny Crosby, was one of his pupils. Root organized and\r\nconducted many music institutes and joined his brother, E. T. Root, and\r\nC. M. Cady in the publishing of music in Chicago under the firm name,\r\nRoot and Cady. He composed many tunes for religious and secular use, and\r\nduring the Civil War wrote numerous “war songs” which became popular. He\r\nalso wrote cantatas—_Under the Palms, David, the Shepherd Boy_, and\r\nothers—which have been used by singing organizations all over America.\r\n\r\n\r\n419. Tell me the stories of Jesus              _W. H. Parker_, 1845-1929\r\n\r\nA hymn for children on the life of Christ. It first appeared in _The\r\nSunday School Hymnary_, published in England, 1885. It was written by\r\nWilliam Henry Parker, a member of the General Baptist Church in England,\r\na layman, interested especially in Sunday school work. He was a\r\nmachinist by trade, working nearly all his life in a large lace-making\r\nplant in Nottingham. For many years he composed hymns for anniversary\r\nfestivals in the Sunday school. These were published in 1882 in a volume\r\nentitled, _The Princess Alice and Other Poems_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ STORIES OF JESUS was written for these words and included in a\r\nvolume published by the National Sunday School Union, London.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Frederic Arthur Challinor, was born in Staffordshire,\r\nEngland, 1866, the son of a miner. Poverty compelled him in childhood to\r\nseek employment to supplement the family income. At the age of ten he\r\nbegan working in a brick yard. Two years later he found employment in a\r\ncoal mine and then in a china manufacturing plant. All the while he was\r\ninterested in music and spent his spare time studying harmony. By hard\r\nwork and perseverance, he finally won his Mus. Bac. degree in 1903.\r\nChallinor has composed several popular cantatas and published more than\r\nfour hundred compositions for voices.\r\n\r\n\r\n420. Jesus bids us shine                         _Susan Warner_, 1819-85\r\n\r\nA hymn for small children, which first appeared, anonymously, in _The\r\nLittle Corporal_, Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe author, Susan Warner, sister of Anna B. Warner (see Hymn 201), was\r\nthe daughter of a reputable attorney in New York State. Her father fell\r\ninto undeserved misfortune which left the daughters as the breadwinners\r\nof the household. This burden they fulfilled by writing stories and\r\nbooks. Susan’s first book, _The Wide, Wide World_, published in 1865\r\nunder the pseudonym of “Elizabeth Wetherall,” became one of the most\r\nwidely read of American novels, second in popularity only to _Uncle\r\nTom’s Cabin_. It was translated into French and German and became a\r\nbest-seller on both sides of the Atlantic. She also wrote a number of\r\ndefinitely religious books for children. Like her sister, Anna, she was\r\nburied at West Point, where the two had conducted a Bible class for many\r\nyears for the cadets of the U. S. Military Academy.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune is by Edwin O. Excell, 1851-1921, an American composer\r\nof Gospel song tunes. In England, the hymn is sung to “Lumetto,” a tune\r\nby Edward Arthur, composed in 1927.\r\n\r\n\r\n421. Here we come with gladness               _Julia H. Johnston_, 1852—\r\n\r\nIntended to be sung as a collection march.\r\n\r\nThe author, Julia Harriette Johnston, born at Salineville, Ohio, was\r\neducated at Gettysburg and Peoria, Illinois, High School. She was much\r\ninterested in missions and Sunday-school work and frequently contributed\r\narticles to magazines, on those subjects. Among her publications were\r\n_The School of the Master_, _Bright Threads_, and the _Life of Adoniram\r\nJudson_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ AUS DEM HIMMEL FERNE is a traditional German melody of unknown\r\nauthorship. It appeared in the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_ and in _Kleiner\r\nLiederschatz_, and is a well known children’s tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PRAYER\r\n\r\n\r\n422. We thank Thee, O our Father               _Catherine Mary McSorley_\r\n\r\nA prayer of thanksgiving, especially for the flowers which, growing in\r\nthe most unlikely places, make the world so bright and fair and reveal\r\nthe power and love of God.\r\n\r\nJulian attributes the hymn to Catherine Mary McSorley but gives no\r\ninformation concerning her. The hymn appeared in the Appendix of the\r\nIrish _Church Hymnal_, 1891, and was published in _Church Hymns_,\r\nEngland, 1903.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ENDSLEIGH. For comments on this tune see Hymn 283.\r\n\r\n\r\n423. Father, we thank Thee for the night       _Rebecca J. Weston_, _c._\r\n                                                                    1890\r\n\r\nA morning prayer. The words were written by Rebecca J. Weston, about\r\n1890, but no information concerning her has been traced. This seems to\r\nbe her only hymn. It appeared in a music-book, _The Tonic Sol-fa\r\nCourse_, published by the Oliver Ditson Company. The editor of that book\r\nwas the Rev. D. Batchellor, who composed the tune. The hymn was included\r\nin _Songs of Praise_, London, 1933.\r\n\r\n\r\n424. Savior, teach me, day by day           _Jane Eliza Leeson_, 1807-82\r\n\r\n“Love’s sweet lesson” has never been presented more beautifully to the\r\nyoung than in this lyric from Miss Leeson’s _Hymns and Scenes of\r\nChildhood_, 1842, where it is entitled “Obedience.” The Scriptural basis\r\nis I John 4:19: “We love him because he first loved us.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Jane Eliza Leeson, see Hymn 298.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ POSEN is a short, vigorous tune which children, as well as\r\nadults, love to sing. The bass is no less interesting than the melody.\r\n\r\nThe composer, George C. Strattner, 1650-1705, was an able German\r\nmusician whose most important work consisted in editing the fifth\r\nedition of Joachim Neander’s _Collected Hymns_, with music, published\r\n1691, in which POSEN first appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n425. Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me           _Mary L. Duncan_, 1814-40\r\n\r\nA beautiful evening prayer, written by the author for her own children.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary Duncan was the daughter of Rev. Robert Lundie, minister at\r\nKelso, England. In 1836, she married the Rev. William Wallace Duncan,\r\nminister of the Scottish parish of Cleish. Between July and December of\r\n1839, the year before her death, she wrote a number of hymns for her\r\nsmall children. These were published in a _Memoir_ by her mother and\r\nlater issued separately—twenty-three in all—as _Rhymes for My Children_,\r\n1842. Mrs. Duncan, whose life ended so prematurely, was a woman of fine\r\nintellect and lovable character, the memory of whom has been described\r\nas one of the “aids to the devout life” of Scotland in the last\r\ngeneration. Her sister married Dr. Horatius Bonar (Hymn 129), minister\r\nand hymn writer.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EVENING PRAYER. For comments on the composer, John Stainer, see\r\nHymn 111. The tune was composed for this hymn in the first edition of\r\n_The Church Hymnary_, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n426. Praise Him! Praise Him!                                 _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nA simple song, of unknown origin, which tiny tots love to sing. The\r\ntruth the song enforces—“God is love”—is one the child will carry into\r\nadulthood and into eternity.\r\n\r\nThe tune is an arrangement by Hubert P. Main, 1839-1925, American\r\ncomposer of popular Sunday school and evangelistic music, and editor of\r\nmany hymn books. For sixty years, Main was connected with the Bigelow\r\nand Main publishing house in Chicago, now out of business. His private\r\nlibrary of song and hymn books, consisting of over 7,000 volumes, is one\r\nof the largest of its kind to be found anywhere. Nearly one-half of it\r\nis in the Chicago Public Library where it is known as the “Main\r\nCollection.” Among his most popular tunes are: “We shall Meet Beyond the\r\nRiver,” “The Bright Forever,” and “In the Fadeless Springtime.”\r\n\r\n\r\n427. I think when I read that sweet story       _Jemima Luke_, 1813-1906\r\n\r\nA hymn that has gone all over the world and has been learned by a\r\ncountless number of children of many nations and races. Concerning its\r\norigin, Mrs. Luke has written:\r\n\r\n  I went one day on some missionary business to the little town of\r\n  Wellington, five miles from Taunton, in a stage coach. It was a\r\n  beautiful spring morning, it was an hour’s ride, and there was no\r\n  other inside passenger. On the back of an old envelope I wrote in\r\n  pencil the first two of the verses now so well known, in order to\r\n  teach the tune to the village school supported by my stepmother, and\r\n  which it was my province to visit. The third verse was added\r\n  afterwards to make it a missionary hymn.\r\n\r\nJemima Luke was the daughter of Thomas Thompson, one of the founders of\r\nthe British and Foreign Sailors’ Society and a “friend of every good\r\ncause.” She volunteered to do missionary work in India, but ill health\r\nmade that impossible. All her life, however, she maintained an active\r\ninterest in foreign missions. In 1843, she married the Rev. Samuel Luke,\r\na Congregational minister in Clifton, England.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SWEET STORY is an arrangement by Wm. B. Bradbury (see Hymn 103)\r\nof a Greek tune known as “Salamis” or “Athens.” Mrs. Luke heard the\r\nmelody (in its original form) used as a marching song by a group of\r\nchildren in a school near her home where she had gone to learn something\r\nof the teaching methods used. She was intrigued by the tune and wrote\r\nthe words to fit it. The words and music are inseparably associated, the\r\noriginal form of the melody being used in England, and Bradbury’s\r\nadaptation (easier but less interesting) in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n428. Jesus loves me! this I know             _Anna B. Warner_, 1820-1915\r\n\r\nA hymn beloved by all the children. It was composed about 1860.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Anna Bartlett Warner, see Hymn 201.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ JESUS LOVES ME. Bradbury’s tune was composed for this hymn in\r\n_The Golden Choir_, 1861.\r\n\r\nFor comments on William B. Bradbury, see Hymn 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n429. Loving Shepherd of Thy sheep           _Jane Eliza Leeson_, 1807-82\r\n\r\nFrom Miss Leeson’s _Hymns and Scenes of Childhood_, 1842. Based on John\r\n10:27: “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them and they follow me.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Jane Eliza Leeson, see Hymn 298.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ INNOCENTS. For comments on this tune, see Hymn 64.\r\n\r\n\r\n430. I am Jesus’ little lamb         _Henriette Luise von Hayn_, 1724-82\r\n\r\nA song of the Good Shepherd’s care of His lambs, based on Isa. 40:11:\r\n“He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with\r\nhis arm, and carry them in his bosom.”\r\n\r\nHenriette Luise von Hayn, born in Idstein, Nassau, early in life gave\r\nher heart to Christ and often rose at night to spend hours on her knees\r\nin prayer. Influenced by the writings of Zinzendorf, she became\r\ninterested in joining the “Brotherhood,” against the wishes of her\r\nparents. One morning, after reading Matthew 10:37, “He that loveth\r\nfather or mother more than me is not worthy of me,” she decided to leave\r\nhome and did so, mailing a letter in the neighboring village to her\r\nparents explaining her intention to go to Herrnhag to join the Moravian\r\ncolony at that place. However, she was detained at Frankfurt and\r\nreturned to her home. Her parents now granted her wish to join the\r\nMoravians and the rest of her life was spent as a useful and influential\r\nmember of the Brotherhood, first at Herrnhag and later at Herrnhut,\r\nwhere she received spiritual instruction from Zinzendorf himself. On\r\nAugust 8, 1776, she wrote “Weil ich Jesu Schäflein bin,” a poem of seven\r\nstanzas, in honor of Sister Christine Petersen’s thirty-sixth birthday.\r\nOur hymn is a selection of three stanzas from this poem.\r\n\r\nThe German version of the poem is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Weil ich Jesu Schäflein bin\r\n    Freu ich mich nur immerhin\r\n  Ueber meinen guten Hirten\r\n    Der mich wohl weiss zu bewirten,\r\n  Der mich liebet, der mich kennt\r\n    Und bei meinem Namen nennt.\r\n\r\n  Unter seinem sanften Stab\r\n    Geh’ ich aus und ein, und hab’\r\n  Unaussprechlich süsse Weide\r\n    Dass ich keinen Mangel leide;\r\n  Und so oft ich durstig bin,\r\n    Führt Er mich zum Brunnquell hin.\r\n\r\n  Sollt’ ich denn nicht fröhlich sein,\r\n    Ich beglücktes Schäfelein?\r\n  Denn nach diesen schönen Tagen\r\n    Werd’ ich endlich heimgetragen\r\n  In des Hirten Arm und Schoss:\r\n    Amen, ja mein Glück ist gross!\r\n\r\nNo information concerning the translator, William F. Stevenson, has been\r\ntraced.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WEIL ICH JESU SCHÄFLEIN BIN is a popular melody, from the\r\n_Gesangbuch mit Noten_ where it appears anonymously. It also appears\r\nwith the same words and translation in the United Lutheran _Common\r\nService Book_, 1918, where the tune is credited to Dölker’s _Geistliche\r\nLieder_, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n431. Sleep, baby, sleep                         _Ferdinand F. Buermeyer_\r\n\r\nThe author of this lullaby, Ferdinand F. Buermeyer, has not been traced.\r\nThe words were written in 1876.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SCHLAF’, KINDLEIN, SCHLAF’ is a German melody composed by\r\nLouise Reichardt, 1788-1826, a German musician, born in Berlin. Her\r\nfather, Johann Friedrich Reichardt, was a composer of operas and other\r\nmusic, and editor of a number of musical periodicals. Louise was a\r\nsinging teacher in Hamburg from 1814 until her death. She composed many\r\nsongs, a collection of which was published by G. Rheinhardt, Munich,\r\n1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n432. When He cometh, when He cometh          _Wm. O. Cushing_, 1823-1903\r\n\r\nBased on Malachi 3:17: “They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in\r\nthat day when I make up my jewels.”\r\n\r\nThe author, William Orcutt Cushing, was a minister of the Christian\r\nChurch and served congregations of that denomination in various cities\r\nin New York State. Towards the close of his life, however, he joined the\r\nMethodist church. He is the author of more than 300 hymns of the gospel\r\nsong type.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ JEWELS. For comments on the composer of this tune, George F.\r\nRoot, see Hymn 418.\r\n\r\n\r\n433. From yon distant heaven                         _W. Hey_, 1789-1854\r\n                                       _Tr. J. R. Thierstein_, 1867-1941\r\n\r\n  Aus dem Himmel ferne,\r\n    Wo die Englein sind,\r\n  Schaut doch Gott so gerne\r\n    Her auf jedes Kind.\r\n\r\n  Höret seine Bitte\r\n    Treu bei Tag und Nacht,\r\n  Nimmt’s bei jedem Schritte\r\n    Väterlich in Acht.\r\n\r\n  Gibt mit Vaterhänden\r\n    Ihm sein Täglich Brot\r\n  Hilft an allen Enden\r\n    Ihm aus Angst und Not.\r\n\r\n  Sagt’s den Kindern allen\r\n    Dass ein Vater ist,\r\n  Dem sie wohlgefallen,\r\n    Der sie nie vergisst.\r\n\r\nA popular song for children which appeared originally in the author’s\r\n_Noch 50 Fabeln für Kinder, nebst einem ernsthaften Anhang_, 1857.\r\n\r\nWilhelm Hey was born in Laucha, near Gotha, where he later became\r\nminister of the local parish. He received his education at Jena and\r\nGöttingen Universities and became a well-known writer, minister, and\r\nteacher. His stories for children and young people were widely read. As\r\na minister he was especially helpful to the poor and sick in the\r\nparishes he served, and took much interest in the distribution of Bibles\r\nwhere needed.\r\n\r\nThe translation was made by John R. Thierstein, Ph.D., Professor of\r\nGerman and French, Bethel College, North Newton, Kansas. Dr. Thierstein\r\nwas born in Bowil, Bern, Switzerland. In addition to his work as college\r\nprofessor, he served the church for a time as editor of _The Mennonite_,\r\nand at the time of his death he was chairman of the Board of\r\nPublications of the General Conference of Mennonites, a position he held\r\nfor some years. In the latter capacity it became his duty to see the\r\n_Mennonite Hymnary_, 1940, through the press, a responsibility he\r\ndischarged with efficiency and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ AUS DEM HIMMEL FERNE. For comments on this tune see Hymn 421.\r\n\r\n\r\n434. Lo! the heavens are breaking                            _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nA spring song, setting forth the love and goodness of God.\r\n\r\nBoth words and melody are anonymous.\r\n\r\n\r\n435. Can a little child like me          _Ascribed to Mary Mapes Dodge_,\r\n                                                               1831-1905\r\n\r\nA children’s hymn of thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nMary Mapes Dodge, to whom the poem is ascribed, wrote stories and poetry\r\nfor children. _Hans Brinker of the Silver Skates_ is her best-known\r\nwork. She was also first editor of _St. Nicholas_ magazine.\r\n\r\nNo information has been traced concerning the composer of the tune, W.\r\nK. Basswood. Words and music were taken from _The Hymnary_, Toronto,\r\n1930, published by the United Church of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MISSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n436. Remember all God’s children              _Percy Dearmer_, 1867-1936\r\n\r\nA missionary hymn for children, but suitable also for adults. It was\r\nwritten at the request of the Church Missionary Society (London) for\r\ntheir children’s magazine, _The Round World_. A few months later,\r\nJanuary 1, 1930, it was reprinted in _Songs of Praise for Boys and\r\nGirls_. The original is in three stanzas of eight lines each. The first\r\nstanza and the first half of the second, omitted in the _Hymnary_, are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  Remember all the people\r\n    Who live in far-off lands\r\n  In strange and lovely cities,\r\n    Or roam the desert sands,\r\n  Or farm the mountain pastures,\r\n    Or till the endless plains\r\n  Where children wade through rice-fields\r\n    And watch the camel-trains:\r\n\r\n  Some work in sultry forests\r\n    Where apes swing to and fro,\r\n  Some fish in mighty rivers,\r\n    Some hunt across the snow.\r\n\r\nPercy Dearmer, prominent figure in the Church of England, was educated\r\nat Oxford, served important posts as minister, and in 1919 became\r\nProfessor of Ecclesiastical Art in King’s College, London. He was editor\r\nof two epoch-making hymn books in England—_The English Hymnal_ and\r\n_Songs of Praise_—and wrote an unexcelled handbook to the latter,\r\nentitled _Songs of Praise Discussed_. He is the author of a number of\r\nreligious books.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EINTRACHT is a melody from the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_, arranged\r\nfor unison or two-part singing by Prof. W. H. Hohmann, head of the Music\r\nDepartment of Bethel College.\r\n\r\nWalter H. Hohmann, born at Halstead, Kansas, received his education at\r\nBethel College and Bush Conservatory of Music, Chicago, the latter\r\ngranting him the degree of Bachelor of Music in 1922, and Master of\r\nMusic in 1928. After teaching several years at Freeman Junior College,\r\nand one year at Nebraska State Teachers College, he joined the Bethel\r\nCollege faculty in 1923. In recognition of his long years of service,\r\nBethel College gave him the honorary degree of Doctor of Music, in 1947.\r\nHe has composed a number of songs and served as co-editor of the\r\n_Mennonite Hymnary_, 1940. He is the author of a booklet, _Outlines in\r\nHymnology with Emphasis on Mennonite Hymnology_, 1941.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK III\r\n                              Gospel Songs\r\n\r\n\r\n437. We praise Thee, O God                   _Wm. Paton Mackay_, 1839-85\r\n\r\nA popular song in the Moody and Sankey revivals. It has few equals as a\r\n“rouser” in a revival or prayer meeting. To create interest and add\r\nvariety in a special song service, Rodeheaver suggests that the leader\r\ntry having the choir sing the chorus all the way through, the\r\ncongregation joining only in the “Hallelujah,” and the last phrase,\r\n“Revive us again.”\r\n\r\nThe author, Wm. Paton Mackay, received his education in the University\r\nof Edinburgh. For some time he was interested in medicine but gave that\r\nup to become the minister of the Prospect Street Presbyterian Church,\r\nHull, England. He came to an untimely death through an accident.\r\nSeventeen of his hymns appeared in W. Reid’s _Praise Book_, 1872. Among\r\nthese was the present hymn, the author’s most widely known work.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ REVIVE US AGAIN is well suited to the text, though it is also\r\nused with Horatio Bonar’s hymn:\r\n\r\n  Rejoice and be glad! for our King is on high;\r\n  He pleadeth for us on his throne in the sky.\r\n\r\n  Rejoice and be glad! for He cometh again;\r\n  He cometh in glory, the Lamb that was slain.\r\n\r\n  Refrain: Sound His praises! tell the story of Him who was slain!\r\n  Sound His praises! tell with gladness, “He liveth again.”\r\n\r\nThe composer, John Jenkins Husband, 1760-1825, born in Plymouth,\r\nEngland, was clerk at Surrey Chapel. In 1809, he came to the United\r\nStates and settled in Philadelphia, where he taught music and served as\r\nclerk of St. Paul’s Protestant Episcopal Church. Husband is the\r\ncomposer, also, of several anthems.\r\n\r\n\r\n438. Praise Him! Praise Him!                _Fanny J. Crosby_, 1820-1915\r\n\r\nOne of the many fine lyrics by the blind poet, Fanny Crosby, first\r\npublished in Bigelow and Main’s _Bright Jewels_, 1869. A useful and\r\npopular praise song.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Fanny Crosby, see Hymn 313.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ALLEN, a favorite tune wherever gospel songs are in use, was\r\ncomposed by Chester Allen, 1812-77, who belongs to an American group of\r\npopular hymn-tune writers composed of Lowry, Bliss, Webb, H. P. Main,\r\nand others. No biographical information concerning him is at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n439. Come, let us all unite to sing                          _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nA hymn built around the theme “God is love,” I John 4:8, 16.\r\n\r\nThe author is unknown.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GOD IS LOVE. This tune was composed by Rev. Edmund S. Lorenz, a\r\nprolific writer of gospel hymn-tunes, and founder and president of the\r\nLorenz Publishing Company, Dayton, Ohio. Lorenz was born in Stark\r\nCounty, Ohio, July 13, 1854, and received his education at Otterbein\r\nUniversity, Union Theological Seminary, Yale Divinity School, and the\r\nUniversity of Leipzig. He was a pastor in the United Brethren Church for\r\na time and then became president of Lebanon Valley College, a post he\r\nwas compelled to resign on account of illness. Regaining his health, he\r\nwent into the publishing business. He prepared _The Church Hymnal_ for\r\nthe United Brethren in Christ in 1935. His publications include\r\n_Practical Church Music_, _The Singing Church_, 1937, and other volumes\r\non sacred music.\r\n\r\n\r\n440. There is no name so sweet on earth     _George W. Bethune_, 1805-62\r\n\r\nA hymn honoring the name of Jesus. John Wesley always objected to words\r\nlike “dear” and “sweet” applied to Jesus, as being too sentimental, and\r\nthe terms are never so used in the New Testament. But the gospel song\r\nwriters have employed them frequently and many good Christians have no\r\nhesitancy in singing them.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Bethune was the son of a prominent merchant, philanthropist,\r\nand churchman in New York City. On the day of his birth he was dedicated\r\nto God by his godly parents, their prayer being that the child may “be\r\nmade a faithful, honored and zealous minister of the everlasting\r\ngospel.” The son was given many educational advantages and made good use\r\nof them. He was admitted to college at 14 and graduated from Princeton\r\nTheological Seminary when only 20 years of age. After serving for a year\r\nas chaplain to the seamen in the port of Savannah, he returned north to\r\naccept the pastorate of a Dutch Reformed Church and later served\r\nchurches in Philadelphia, Brooklyn, and elsewhere. A man of fine\r\nliterary taste and good scholarship, he was offered, but declined, the\r\nProvostship of the University of Pennsylvania and the Chancellorship of\r\nNew York University. He preferred to be a preacher of the Gospel. To his\r\nson and sons-in-law, he gave this dying charge: “My sons, preach the\r\nGospel. Tell dying sinners of a Saviour. All the rest is but folly.” He\r\nwent to Florence, Italy, for his health and died there on a Sunday night\r\nafter having preached in the Scottish Church in the morning on the text,\r\n“Be of good cheer: thy sins be forgiven thee.” The following poem, found\r\nin his portfolio, was written on the Saturday before his death:\r\n\r\n  When time seems short and death is near,\r\n    And I am pressed by doubt and fear,\r\n  And sins, an overflowing tide,\r\n    Assail my peace on every side,\r\n  This thought my refuge still shall be,\r\n    I know the Saviour died for me.\r\n\r\n  His name is Jesus, and he died,\r\n    For guilty sinners crucified;\r\n  Content to die that he might win\r\n    Their ransom from the death of sin:\r\n  No sinner worse than I can be,\r\n    Therefore I know he died for me.\r\n\r\n  If grace were bought, I could not buy;\r\n    If grace were coined, no wealth have I;\r\n  By grace alone I draw my breath,\r\n    Held up from everlasting death;\r\n  Yet, since I know his grace is free,\r\n    I know the Saviour died for me.\r\n\r\n  I read God’s holy Word, and find\r\n    Great truths which far transcend my mind;\r\n  And little do I know beside\r\n    Of thoughts so high, so deep, so wide:\r\n  This is my best theology,\r\n    I know the Saviour died for me.\r\n\r\n  My faith is weak, but ’tis Thy gift;\r\n    Thou canst my helpless soul uplift,\r\n  And say, “Thy bonds of death are riven,\r\n    Thy sins by Me are all forgiven;\r\n  And thou shalt live from guilt set free,\r\n    For I, thy Saviour, died for thee.”\r\n\r\nHis body was brought to New York for burial. Among the directions he had\r\nleft for his funeral was this: “Sing my own hymn, ‘It is not death to\r\ndie,’ to a cheerful tune.” The request was carried out. The hymn\r\nreferred to is a translation he had made of a poem by the distinguished\r\nSwiss preacher, César Malan.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SWEETEST NAME. The name of the tune is obviously derived from\r\nthe words for which it was composed. For comments on the composer, Wm.\r\nB. Bradbury, see Hymn 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n441. Take my heart, O Father, take it                        _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nA simple hymn of consecration and devotion whose author evidently\r\npreferred to remain anonymous.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DORRNANCE. The tune is simplicity itself. Concerning his tunes,\r\nWoodbury wrote in the preface to his _New Lute of Zion_, 1856:\r\n\r\n  The music is not designed for the fastidious and scientific musician\r\n  whose highest delight, and perhaps sole worship, is music as an art,\r\n  but for those who love to worship God in the simple song of praise.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Isaac B. Woodbury, 1819-58, see Hymn 261.\r\n\r\n\r\n442. ’Tis the promise of God, full salvation to give          _Philip P.\r\n                                                         Bliss_, 1838-76\r\n\r\nA hymn with a curious origin which became popular in revival meetings.\r\nIt voices the spontaneous thanksgivings that break out at the\r\nannouncement of a conversion. Bliss wanted to include “Hallelujah! Thine\r\nthe glory” (No. 437) in his _Gospel Songs_, 1874. The owner of the\r\ncopyright refused permission whereupon Bliss wrote “Hallelujah! ’tis\r\ndone”—both words and music—as a substitute.\r\n\r\nPhilip P. Bliss, a Congregationalist, born in Rome, Pa., was reared in\r\nthe country. He had only the meagerest early advantages for the\r\ndevelopment of his musical talents but he made the most of them and\r\nbecame one of the greatest leaders and writers of evangelistic songs.\r\nCombining the gift of poet and musician, he succeeded in putting gospel\r\ntruths in poetic and singable form, usually writing both words and\r\nmusic. In his early career he conducted musical conventions throughout\r\nthe Middle West, served as director of music for the First\r\nCongregational Church in Chicago, and was connected with the music\r\npublishing house of Root and Cady in Chicago. Through the influence of\r\nD. L. Moody, he gave up his business and professional pursuits and\r\nentered the evangelistic field. He assisted Sankey in the editing of the\r\nseries called _Gospel Hymns_, in which some of his own celebrated hymns\r\nand songs first appeared. His rare gifts as a singer and leader,\r\ncombined with an impressive personality, made him one of the outstanding\r\nleaders in the evangelistic movement. His life came to an early and\r\ntragic end December 29, 1876, in a railroad disaster near Ashtabula,\r\nOhio, while he and Mrs. Bliss were returning to Chicago from Rome, Pa.,\r\nwhere the two had spent Christmas. A railroad bridge gave way, resulting\r\nin a wreck which took the lives of one hundred passengers. Bliss had\r\nescaped unhurt, but going back to rescue his wife, he was evidently\r\novercome by the flames which had spread and was not seen again. His\r\npremature death at the age of 38 was widely lamented.\r\n\r\n\r\n443. Come, we that love the Lord                _Isaac Watts_, 1674-1748\r\n\r\nThis hymn, entitled by Watts, “Heavenly Joy on Earth,” appeared in his\r\n_Hymns and Sacred Songs_, 1707.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Isaac Watts, see Hymn 11.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune is by Robert Lowry, 1826-99, a Baptist minister who\r\nheld a pastorate in Brooklyn, N. Y., and did much to promote the gospel\r\nsong movement. He edited a series of eight books for Bigelow and Main,\r\nwith such titles as _Bright Jewels_ and _Pure Gold_, to which he added a\r\nlarge number of tunes of his own composition. The public bought these\r\nbooks by the hundreds of thousands. Lowry had no serious training in\r\nmusic and did not take up composition until middle life. He was\r\nconcerned mostly with the production of music which was popularly\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nWatts’ hymn appears in many hymn books with the more dignified tune,\r\n“St. Thomas,” by Williams (No. 269).\r\n\r\n\r\n444. I lay my sins on Jesus                    _Horatius Bonar_, 1808-89\r\n\r\nThe hymn, entitled “The Fulness of Jesus,” was written for children in a\r\ndesire to provide something which children could sing and appreciate in\r\ndivine worship. It is generally supposed to be the first hymn Bonar\r\nwrote. He used to say of this hymn that it might be good gospel but that\r\nit was not good poetry. Bonar loved children and for them his first\r\nhymns were written.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Horatius Bonar see Hymn 129.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PRYSGOL, composed by W. Owen, 1814-93, was taken from the\r\n_Hymnary_ of the United Church of Canada. No information regarding the\r\ncomposer or the origin of the hymn has been traced.\r\n\r\n\r\n445. I’ve found a Friend, O such a Friend      _James G. Small_, 1817-88\r\n\r\nThis hymn was written by a minister of the Free Church of Scotland and\r\nappeared in _The Revival Hymn Book_, 2d series, 1863, and later in the\r\nauthor’s _Psalms and Sacred Songs_, 1866.\r\n\r\nJames Grindlay Small was educated at Edinburgh University where Dr.\r\nThomas Chalmers was one of his professors. He became minister of a\r\nchurch in 1847, but owing to peculiarities of voice and manner, he never\r\nsucceeded well as a preacher. However, he was a man of fine Christian\r\ncharacter and had the confidence of his brethren. Small was interested\r\nin hymnology and is the author of a number of hymns and poems.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FRIEND. The tune was written by Stebbins while he and Dr.\r\nPentecost were conducting an evangelistic campaign in Providence, R. I.\r\nIt was first published in _Gospel Hymns No. 3_, one of a series of\r\npopular books with which the composer’s name was associated as\r\nco-editor.\r\n\r\nFor comments on George Stebbins see Hymn 38.\r\n\r\n\r\n446. I have found a Friend in Jesus                          _C. W. Fry_\r\n\r\nA song of the friendship of Jesus and its meaning to one who experiences\r\nit. The words are based on Song of Songs 2:1-2:\r\n\r\n  “I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. As the lily\r\n  among the thorns, so is my love among the daughters.” Also on\r\n  Revelation 22:16: “I am the root and offspring of David, and the\r\n  bright and morning star.”\r\n\r\nThe author, C. W. Fry, was prominent in Salvation Army circles in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LILY OF THE VALLEY is an English melody of anonymous\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n447. One is kind above all others             _Marianne Nunn_, 1778-1847\r\n\r\nA hymn on the love of Jesus, which has been used extensively as a song\r\nfor children, especially in England. It was originally written to adapt\r\nJohn Newton’s hymn:\r\n\r\n  “One there is above all others,\r\n  Well deserves the name of friend,”\r\n\r\nto the Welsh air, “Ar hyd y nos” (No. 35), and the hymn may well be sung\r\nto this tune.\r\n\r\nMarianne Nunn was an English woman of refinement and culture. She is the\r\nauthor of _The Benevolent Merchant_, and of several hymns. The latter\r\nwere published in _Psalms and Hymns_, 1817, a collection compiled by her\r\nbrother, Rev. John Nunn, who also contributed some of his own hymns to\r\nthe same volume.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CARITAS. No information has been traced concerning Richard W.\r\nBeaty, 1799-1883, composer of the tune. The editors of the _Hymnary_\r\nfound the tune and words in the _Hymnary_ of the United Church of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n\r\n448. Brightly beams our Father’s mercy        _Philip P. Bliss_, 1838-76\r\n\r\nA song which is best understood by people living on the sea-coast or\r\nlakeshore, or whose lives are spent in work which keeps them upon the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe words were suggested by an illustration given by D. L. Moody in one\r\nof his sermons:\r\n\r\n  On a dark, stormy night, when the waves rolled like mountains and not\r\n  a star was to be seen, a boat, rocking and plunging, neared the\r\n  Cleveland harbor. “Are you sure this is Cleveland?” asked the captain,\r\n  seeing only one light from the lighthouse. “Quite sure, sir,” replied\r\n  the pilot. “Where are the lower lights?” “Gone out, sir.” “Can you\r\n  make the harbor?” “We must, or perish, sir!” With a strong hand and a\r\n  brave heart the old pilot turned the wheel. But, alas, in the darkness\r\n  he missed the channel, and with a crash upon the rocks the boat was\r\n  shivered, and many a life lost in a watery grave. Brethren, the Master\r\n  will take care of the great lighthouse; let us keep the lower lights\r\n  burning.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LOWER LIGHTS. There is awakening power in the tune and\r\ncongregations love to sing it. It is especially effective when sung by a\r\nlarge number of voices. The chorus lends itself to interesting\r\nantiphonal effects in a special song service. Let the whole congregation\r\nsing the first phrase, a smaller group the second; the whole\r\ncongregation again the third phrase, and the smaller group the last.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author and composer, Philip P. Bliss, see Hymn 442.\r\n\r\n\r\n449. Lead me gently home, Father           _Will L. Thompson_, 1847-1909\r\n\r\nWritten by the author of “Softly and tenderly, Jesus is calling.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Will L. Thompson, who wrote both words and music, see\r\nHymn 456.\r\n\r\n\r\n450. I know whom I have believed          _Daniel W. Whittle_, 1840-1901\r\n\r\nThe hymn is built around the verse: “I know whom I have believed, and am\r\npersuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him\r\nagainst that day” (II Tim. 1:12), which serves as a refrain. The general\r\nstructure of the hymn is similar to Farrington’s “I know not how that\r\nBethlehem’s Babe” (No. 99).\r\n\r\nDaniel W. Whittle was born in Chicopee Falls, Mass. At the age of 15, he\r\nwent to Chicago to work in a bank, but at the outbreak of the Civil War\r\nhe became attached to the Illinois Infantry and served for the duration,\r\ngoing with Sherman, as a lieutenant, on his “March to the Sea.” At the\r\nclose of the war he was promoted to the rank of major. He was the\r\ntreasurer of a business firm, when, in 1873, he heeded the call of God\r\nto enter the evangelistic field where he became associated with D. L.\r\nMoody. He was a powerful speaker and lecturer; and frequently, with the\r\nassistance of singers like P. P. Bliss, James McGranahan, and George\r\nStebbins, continued evangelistic campaigns begun by Moody, under the\r\nlatter’s direction. Whittle was a great friend of children and knew how\r\nto put evangelical truth in words they understood, supplementing his\r\ntalks with wall maps, illustrations, and chemical experiments. His\r\ndaughter, Mary, became the wife of Will L. Moody, son of the evangelist.\r\nHe was a member of the Congregational Church. His hymns, written after\r\n1877, mostly for McGranahan, reveal true poetic talent, though he made\r\nno claim to be a poet. Among his best known hymns are: “I know whom I\r\nhave believed,” “Dying with Jesus,” “Moment by moment,” “Fierce and\r\nwild.” The latter was translated into German by Ernst Gebhardt,\r\ntranslator of “_Ich weiss einen Strom_.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune is by James W. McGranahan, 1840-1907, who succeeded\r\nthe lamented P. P. Bliss as song leader in the evangelistic campaigns\r\nconducted by Major Whittle. Between 1881 and 1885, Whittle and\r\nMcGranahan made two successful tours of England, Scotland, and Ireland,\r\nand the chief cities of America. McGranahan, born at Adamsville, Pa.,\r\nreceived only an elementary-school education. His native musical talent\r\nand some assistance from men like Bassini, Webb, Root, and Zerrahn\r\nenabled him to make rapid progress in music; and he soon taught music\r\nclasses of his own. He was gifted with a beautiful tenor voice and an\r\nimpressive personality to add to his power as a song leader.\r\n\r\n\r\n451. O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found                    _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nThe authorship of this hymn remains unknown. That “gospel songs” are\r\noften appreciated by highly educated and cultured people is illustrated\r\nby the fact that this hymn was a favorite of Professor Henry Drummond,\r\nwho used it frequently at meetings for university students in Edinburgh,\r\n1885-89.\r\n\r\n_Music._ NONE BUT CHRIST was composed for this hymn and published in\r\nMcGranahan’s _Sacred Songs and Solos_, 1883.\r\n\r\nFor comments on James McGranahan see Hymn 450.\r\n\r\n\r\n452. Low in the grave He lay                     _Robert Lowry_, 1826-99\r\n\r\nThe words and music of this Easter song are by Rev. Robert Lowry,\r\nwritten while he was pastor of a Baptist church in Brooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\nLowry was a faithful and successful minister of the Gospel, but is more\r\nwidely known as a composer of sacred music. “I felt a sort of meanness\r\nwhen I began to be known as a composer,” he said. His first love was\r\npreaching. Music was to him a “side issue,” and the making and delivery\r\nof a sermon ranked far above the writing of a hymn. He is the author of\r\nthe popular song, “Where is my wandering boy tonight,” and wrote the\r\ntune to “I need Thee every hour,” and edited many successful Sunday\r\nschool and evangelistic hymn books.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Lowry see Hymn 187.\r\n\r\n\r\n453. I know that my Redeemer liveth         _Jessie H. Brown_, 1861-1921\r\n\r\nA popular Easter song based on Job 19:25: “I know that my redeemer\r\nliveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth.”\r\n\r\nJessie H. Brown was born in Hiram, a college suburb of Cleveland, Ohio.\r\nDue to ill health in childhood, she gained most of her education at\r\nhome. At 15 years of age, she began to write for Cleveland newspapers\r\nand religious weeklies and for many years wrote hymns for Fillmore Bros.\r\nIn 1896 she married Rev. John E. Pounds, at that time pastor of the\r\nCentral Christian Church in Indianapolis, and later college pastor at\r\nHiram. Her early poems bear her maiden name, while the later ones (No.\r\n498, for example) are signed “Jessie B. Pounds.” She is the author of 9\r\nbooks, 50 librettos for cantatas and operettas, and nearly 400 hymns.\r\nHer best known song poems are “Anywhere with Jesus, I can safely go,”\r\n“The way of the Cross leads home,” “Beautiful Isle of Somewhere,” and\r\nthe present, “I know that my Redeemer liveth.” The latter appeared first\r\nin an Easter cantata entitled, _Hope’s Messenger_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FILLMORE was composed by James H. Fillmore who was born June 1,\r\n1849, in Cincinnati, Ohio, into a musical family. After his father’s\r\ndeath, James headed the Fillmore music publishing business in Cincinnati\r\nfor many years. His compositions include numerous popular titles: “I am\r\nresolved,” “I know that my Redeemer liveth,” “Only waiting,” and many\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n454. O the unsearchable riches of Christ    _Fanny J. Crosby_, 1820-1915\r\n\r\nThe well-known fact that Fanny Crosby was blind all her life adds pathos\r\nto the power of her songs. The hymn reveals the spiritual riches in her\r\nlife notwithstanding the cross of affliction laid on her through the\r\nloss of her eyesight. Frances Ridley Havergal (See Hymn 126), the gifted\r\nEnglish poet and hymn writer, paid her tribute to Fanny Crosby in the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n  How can she sing in the dark like this?\r\n  What is her fountain of light and bliss?\r\n  With never the light of a loving face\r\n  Must not the world be a desolate place?\r\n\r\n  O, her heart can see, her heart can see!\r\n  And its sight is strong and swift and free.\r\n  Never the ken of mortal eye\r\n  Could pierce so deep and far and high\r\n  As the eagle vision of hearts that dwell\r\n  In that lofty, sunlit citadel.\r\n\r\n  For the King himself, in his tender grace,\r\n  Hath shown her the brightness of his face;\r\n  She can read his law as a shining chart,\r\n  For his finger hath written it on her heart;\r\n  And she reads his love, for on all her way\r\n  His hand is writing it every day.\r\n  O, this is why she sings so free:\r\n  Her heart can see, her heart can see!\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ For comments on the composer, John R. Sweney, 1837-99, see Hymn\r\n342.\r\n\r\n\r\n455. It may be at morn, when the day is awaking           _H. L. Turner_\r\n\r\nA song of the imminent return of our Lord, based on I Thess. 5:2: “The\r\nday of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night,”—and the lengthier\r\npassage in I Thess. 4:15-18.\r\n\r\nInformation concerning the author, H. L. Turner, has not been traced.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CHRIST RETURNETH. For comments on the composer, James\r\nMcGranahan, see Hymn 450.\r\n\r\n\r\n456. Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling            _Will L. Thompson_,\r\n                                                               1847-1909\r\n\r\nA song which has wide use as an invitational hymn at revival meetings.\r\n\r\nWill Lamartine Thompson was born at East Liverpool, Ohio, and made his\r\nhome there all his life. He attended Mt. Union College, Alliance, Ohio,\r\nand studied music at the Boston Conservatory of Music. His greatest\r\ninterest was in sacred song, but he also wrote secular songs, among them\r\nthe popular, “Come where the lilies bloom.” A successful businessman and\r\nsong writer, Thompson was known also as a man of beautiful and sterling\r\nChristian character. “Simplicity, sincerity, humility, and righteousness\r\nmarked his life.” He once called to inquire of D. L. Moody at a time\r\nwhen the latter lay very ill and visitors were forbidden. Moody insisted\r\nthat Thompson be admitted and said to him in the course of their brief\r\nconversation: “I would rather have written ‘Softly and tenderly Jesus is\r\ncalling’ than anything I have been able to do in my whole life.”\r\n\r\n\r\n457. Come, every soul by sin oppressed       _John H. Stockton_, 1813-77\r\n\r\nAn invitation hymn that has been a help and blessing to many. The\r\noriginal refrain:\r\n\r\n  “Come to Jesus, come to Jesus,\r\n    Come to Jesus now.”\r\n\r\nwas changed by Ira Sankey to\r\n\r\n  “Only trust Him, only trust Him.”\r\n\r\nIn leading this song, Sankey sometimes changed the chorus to\r\n\r\n  “I will trust Him,” or “I do trust Him.”\r\n\r\nJohn H. Stockton, composer of words and music, was born at New Hope,\r\nPa., and reared in a Presbyterian family. At the age of 19 he was\r\nconverted in a Methodist camp meeting and became a Methodist preacher.\r\nAfter many years of pastoral and evangelistic work, as a member of the\r\nNew Jersey Annual Conference, he retired in 1874. He had considerable\r\nmusical ability and published two gospel song books, _Salvation\r\nMelodies_, 1874, and _Precious Songs_, 1875. He rendered valuable\r\nassistance in the Moody and Sankey meeting held in Philadelphia, after\r\nwhich Sankey wrote him:\r\n\r\n  I thank my Heavenly Father for enabling you to write so much sweet\r\n  music, as well as words; and I hope you may long be spared to bless\r\n  the world with your “precious songs.” I wish you to accept our regards\r\n  for one whose songs have been blessed to tens of thousands in the\r\n  lands beyond the seas.\r\n\r\nStockton died suddenly while talking to friends just after having\r\nattended the morning service at Arch Street Church, Philadelphia, on\r\nMarch 25, 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\n458. Just as I am, without one plea       _Charlotte Elliott_, 1789-1871\r\n\r\nAn immortal hymn expressing the feelings and needs of all penitent\r\nbelievers. It has been a source of comfort and help to multitudes of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n“You must come to Christ just as you are.” These words, spoken to Miss\r\nElliott by Dr. César Malan of Geneva, at a time when she was suffering\r\nand spiritually depressed, resulted in a new birth and formed the basis\r\nof her hymn, written twelve years later, in 1834, and now known all over\r\nthe world. The hymn was first published in the author’s _Invalids’ Hymn\r\nBook_, 1836, headed with the text, John 6:37: “All that the Father\r\ngiveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I shall in no wise\r\ncast out.”\r\n\r\nThe words were written one day when other members of her family were\r\nbusy arranging for a bazaar to be held for a school banquet. The\r\nimmediate circumstances are related by Dr. Handley C. G. Moule, Bishop\r\nof Durham, as follows:\r\n\r\n  The night before the bazaar she was kept wakeful by distressing\r\n  thoughts of her apparent uselessness; and these thoughts passed into a\r\n  spiritual conflict till she questioned the reality of her whole\r\n  spiritual life and wondered whether it were anything better, after\r\n  all, than an illusion of the emotions—an illusion ready to be\r\n  sorrowfully dispelled. The next day, the busy day of the bazaar, the\r\n  troubles of the night came back upon her with such force that she felt\r\n  they must be met and conquered in the grace of God. She gathered up in\r\n  her soul the grand certainties, not of her emotions, but of her\r\n  salvation: her Lord, his power, his promise. And taking pen and paper\r\n  from the table, she deliberately set down in writing for her own\r\n  comfort the formulae of her faith. So in verse she restated to herself\r\n  the gospel of pardon, peace, and heaven. As the day wore on, her\r\n  sister-in-law, Mrs. H. V. Elliott, came in to see her and bring news\r\n  of the work. She read the hymn and asked (she well might) for a copy.\r\n  So it first stole out from that quiet room into the world, where now\r\n  for sixty years it has been sowing and reaping till a multitude which\r\n  only God can number have been blessed through its message.\r\n\r\nThough a helpless invalid, Miss Elliott probably did more that day for\r\nher Lord and the upbuilding of His Kingdom than the rest of the family,\r\nall strong in body.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was sent to Dora Wordsworth, daughter of the poet, while she\r\nwas on her death bed. Her husband, Edward Quillinan, has written of the\r\nincident in a letter to Miss Elliott, dated July 28, 1847. He tells of\r\nDora’s appreciation of the hymn and her continual use of it during her\r\nlast days on earth.\r\n\r\nAfter Miss Elliott died, more than a thousand letters, thanking her for\r\nthis hymn, were found.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Charlotte Elliott see Hymn 233.\r\n\r\nA translation of this hymn has had wide use in Germany where it is sung\r\nto the tune, “Jesus, meine Zuversicht.”\r\n\r\n  Wie ich bin, komm’ ich zu dir—\r\n  Nichts hat mir die Tür erschlossen,\r\n  Als dein Ruf: “Kommt her zu mir,”\r\n  Und dein Blut, für mich geflossen;\r\n  Diesz allein ermutigt mich—\r\n    Gotteslamm, hier komme ich!\r\n\r\n  Wie ich bin, komm’ ich zu dir!\r\n  Auch nicht einen meiner Fehle\r\n  Auszutilgen, steht bei mir;\r\n  Meine schuldbefleckte Seele\r\n  Wird gereinigt nur durch dich,\r\n    Gotteslamm, hier komme ich!\r\n\r\n  Wie ich bin, komm’ ich zu dir,\r\n  Ob auch Zweifel mich umfangen;\r\n  Umgetrieben bin ich hier\r\n  Von so manchem Kampf und Bangen,\r\n  Trübsal in—und äuszerlich—\r\n    Gotteslamm, hier komme ich!\r\n\r\n  Wie ich bin, tret’ ich herzu—\r\n  Elend, arm, am Geist erblindet;\r\n  Meinen Mangel stillest du;\r\n  Heilung, Reichtum, der nicht schwindet,\r\n  Alles finde ich durch dich—\r\n    Gotteslamm, hier komme ich!\r\n\r\n  Wie ich bin, komm’ ich zu dir,\r\n  Deine Liebe sonder Gleichen\r\n  Ist zu stark geworden mir,\r\n  Alle Schranken müssen weichen;\r\n  Dir, nur dir verschreib’ ich mich—\r\n    Gotteslamm, hier komme ich!\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WOODWORTH was first published in Hastings’ and Bradbury’s\r\nhymnal, _The Third Book of Psalms_, 1849, set to the words, “The God of\r\nlove will surely indulge.” The tune became widely known after its\r\nassociation with “Just as I am, without one plea.” It is the most\r\npopular of Bradbury’s tunes and appears in nearly all American hymnals.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Wm. Bradbury see Hymn 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n459. Come, ye sinners, poor and needy             _Joseph Hart_, 1712-68\r\n\r\nAn evangelistic song, written by a Congregational minister. Hart, born\r\nin London and brought up in a devout Christian home, was well educated\r\nand taught the classics for many years. Early in life he departed from\r\nhis religious training and fell into a life of “carnal and spiritual\r\nwickedness, irreligious and profane.” After continuing in this state for\r\na long period of years, during which he exerted a pernicious influence\r\nupon all with whom he associated, Hart became deeply convicted, in his\r\nfortieth year, and betook himself to daily prayer and Bible reading. He\r\nwas finally converted upon hearing a sermon on Rev. 3:10: “Because thou\r\nhast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour\r\nof temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that\r\ndwell upon the earth”—preached in the Moravian Chapel in Fetter Lane,\r\nLondon. Becoming an earnest and consecrated Christian, and writer of\r\nhymns, he was importuned to become a preacher, which he did, although in\r\nhis 48th year. From 1760 till his death in 1768, he preached regularly\r\nas pastor of an Independent Congregation in London, drawing large\r\ncrowds. He died in the midst of labors and successes almost\r\nunprecedented, and it is said that 20,000 people came to his funeral. He\r\nis remembered chiefly, however, for his hymns, most of them of the\r\nevangelistic type.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GREENVILLE, a beautifully quaint and popular tune, was not\r\nwritten for sacred use but for a little song in the opera _Le Devin du\r\nVillage_, by Rousseau. It was once popular in a piano arrangement known\r\nas “Rousseau’s Dream.”\r\n\r\nJean Jacques Rousseau, 1712-78, philosopher and musician, was born at\r\nGeneva. Though not a religious man, he greatly influenced education in\r\nEurope and became one of the great forces in modern literature. A\r\npolitical radical, he was forced to leave France and for a time lived in\r\nEngland. His opera, _Le Devin du Village_, was a success, but none of\r\nhis later musical efforts came to anything. He lived an unhappy life and\r\nis thought to have committed suicide. His death occurred near Paris,\r\nJuly 3, 1778.\r\n\r\n\r\n460. I have a Savior, He’s pleading in glory          _S. O’Maley Cluff_\r\n\r\nA favorite prayer-meeting hymn for many years, in many churches.\r\n\r\nSankey came across these words in a printed leaflet while he was on his\r\nfirst visit with D. L. Moody to Ireland in 1874. It was the second hymn\r\nto which he wrote music and was much used in later Moody-Sankey revival\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nNo definite information has been traced by hymnologists concerning\r\nSamuel O’Malley Clough to whom the words are attributed. He is believed\r\nto have been an Irish clergyman who left the Established Church to unite\r\nwith the Plymouth Brethren in Ireland; later (1881) seceding from that\r\nbody to lead a “holiness” schism which has since become extinct. Julian\r\nand others spell the name “Clough”; Sankey spells it “Cluff.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CLUFF derives its name from the author of the words to which\r\nSankey set the tune.\r\n\r\nIra David Sankey, 1840-1908, famous singer of “gospel songs,” was born\r\nin Edinburg, Pa., and was a member of the Methodist Church. For many\r\nyears he was associated with D. L. Moody in evangelistic work in America\r\nand England. He composed many gospel tunes, the most popular of which is\r\nhis “Ninety and Nine,” and edited numerous songbooks. Concerning his own\r\ngift of singing and songs suited to his purpose, he wrote:\r\n\r\n  I am no musician, I am no singer; I was never taught to sing.... As to\r\n  my singing there is no art or conscious design in it. I never touch a\r\n  song that does not speak to me in every word and phrase. Before I sing\r\n  I must feel, and the hymn must be of such a kind that I know I can\r\n  send home what I feel into the hearts of those who listen. I find it\r\n  much more difficult to get good words than good music. Our best words\r\n  come from England; the music which best suits our purpose comes from\r\n  America. Your composers, apparently, do not care to write simple songs\r\n  such as we need. We can get plenty of the grand and solid style, but\r\n  though that is useful now and again, our services could not thrive on\r\n  it.\r\n\r\nHomer Rodeheaver has used this song with antiphonal effects by letting\r\nthe choir sing the first phrase of the refrain, the audience responding\r\nwith the second; or, if the audience is large, letting one side, then\r\nthe other side, then the whole congregation, then the gallery sing,\r\nsuccessively, one phrase each of the refrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n461. A ruler once came to Jesus by night                 _W. T. Sleeper_\r\n\r\nBased on our Lord’s words to Nicodemus: “Verily, verily, I say unto you,\r\n... ye must be born again” (John 3:3-7).\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written by Rev. W. T. Sleeper, one of the pastors in the\r\ncity of Worcester, Mass., upon the request of Geo. C. Stebbins, who was\r\nassisting Dr. Pentecost in a revivalistic campaign in that city. One of\r\nthe latter’s sermon themes was “The New Birth.” As the truth of this\r\ngreat theme was being enforced and illustrated, it occurred to Stebbins\r\nthat a musical setting of this Scripture passage in John 3 would be an\r\neffective means of emphasizing the truth of the new birth. He asked the\r\nRev. Sleeper to write some verses on the subject and the result was this\r\nhymn. Before the meetings closed, Stebbins had composed this tune for\r\nthe words. The song was published in _Gospel Hymns, No. 3_, and has been\r\nwidely used as solo, choir number, and congregational song in revival\r\nmeetings and otherwise.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BORN AGAIN. For comments on George C. Stebbins, 1846-1945, a\r\ncomposer of the tune, see Hymn 38.\r\n\r\n\r\n462. I hear the Savior say                      _Elvina M. Hall_, 1818-?\r\n\r\nA much-used and much-loved revival hymn which came into use, especially\r\nin Methodist churches, several years before Moody’s great revivalistic\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elvina M. Hall (later Mrs. Myers), author of the words, was born in\r\nAlexandria, Va., in 1818. She composed this hymn, strangely enough,\r\nwhile sitting in the choir of the M. E. Church, Baltimore, pencilling\r\nthe first draft on a fly-leaf of a hymn book, _The New Lute of Zion_,\r\nduring the pastor’s prayer! It is the only hymn known that can be traced\r\nto such an origin. The author’s mind, indeed, wandered from the\r\nimmediate service of worship, but it did not stray from God and prayer.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ALL TO CHRIST. John T. Grape, born in Baltimore, Md., 1833, was\r\nchoir director in his church when he wrote the tune, after having made\r\nit “a matter of prayer and study.” He writes that “it was pronounced\r\nvery poor by my choir and my friends, but my dear wife persistently\r\ndeclared it was a good piece of music and would live.” Mrs. Grape’s\r\nfaith was justified by the wide reception and use the tune has enjoyed.\r\nThe minister of the church, Rev. Mr. Schrick, liked the tune upon\r\nhearing it and suggested that it be used with the words written by Mrs.\r\nElvina M. Hall. This was done, and the song started on its career. It\r\nwas first published in a volume called, _Sabbath Chords_.\r\n\r\n\r\n463. Amazing grace! how sweet the sound         _John Newton_, 1725-1807\r\n\r\nThe original has six stanzas and is entitled, “Faith’s Review and\r\nExpectation.”\r\n\r\nThe hymn reminds one of Newton’s words: “I can never forget two things:\r\nfirst, that I was a great sinner, and second, that Jesus is a great\r\nSaviour.” It is based on I Chron. 17:16, 17:\r\n\r\n  Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine house, that Thou hast brought\r\n  me hitherto? And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for\r\n  thou hast also spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to\r\n  come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high\r\n  degree, O Lord God.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Newton, see Hymn 274.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MCINTOSH, also known as “Amazing Grace,” is believed to be an\r\nold Southern melody. It appeared in _Southern Harmony_, by William\r\nWalker, 1835, anonymously. Dr. Robert McCutchan thinks it may be a\r\nvariant of an old tune called “Loving Lamb.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Edwin O. Excell, 1851-1921, who arranged the tune, see\r\nHymn 420.\r\n\r\n\r\n464. Down at the cross where my Savior died         _Elisha A. Hoffman_,\r\n                                                                  1839-?\r\n\r\nThe words are by the Rev. Elisha A. Hoffman who was born of Pennsylvania\r\nGerman parents. Hoffman became a Congregational minister and served\r\nchurches of his denomination in Lebanon, Pa., and other places, and\r\nwrote a number of hymns and tunes.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GLORY TO HIS NAME. For comments on the composer of this tune,\r\nRev. John H. Stockton, see Hymn 457.\r\n\r\n\r\n465. O happy day, that fixed my choice       _Philip Doddridge_, 1702-51\r\n\r\nThis hymn, reflecting spiritual joy, is often used at baptismal services\r\nand is also one of the best revival hymns. It is based on II Chron.\r\n15:15: “And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all\r\ntheir heart, and sought him with their whole desire; ... and the Lord\r\ngave them rest round about.”\r\n\r\nThe original title was “Rejoicing in our covenant engagements to God.”\r\nIt was published in 1819, by the author’s great-grandson, John Doddridge\r\nHumphreys.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was chosen by Prince Albert, the consort of Queen Victoria, to\r\nbe sung always on occasions when members of the royal family were\r\nconfirmed. It reflects a deep and rich experience of God. “Blessed is\r\nthe man,” says James Montgomery, “who can take the words of the hymn and\r\nmake them his own from similar experience.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Philip Doddridge see Hymn 56.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HAPPY DAY is an adaptation from a work by E. F. Rimbault,\r\n1816-76, a London scholar, musician and writer. He became organist at\r\nSwiss Church, Soho, London, and was offered, but declined, the chair of\r\nprofessor of music at Harvard University. The tune was originally a\r\npopular secular melody. The English _Hymnary_ uses this hymn set to a\r\ntune called “Heaton Norris,” with refrain omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n466. Sinners Jesus will receive          _Arr. from Erdmann Neumeister_,\r\n                                                               1671-1756\r\n                                    _Tr. Emma Frances Beaven_, 1827-1909\r\n\r\nAn English version of a popular German hymn which appeared first in the\r\nauthor’s _Evangelische Nachklänge_, Hamburg, 1719. The hymn is\r\nappropriate for missionary services. The original in eight stanzas,\r\nwritten by Neumeister as a conclusion to a sermon on Luke 15:1, “Then\r\ndrew near to him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him,” is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                   1.\r\n  Jesus nimmt die Sünder an;\r\n    Saget doch dies Trostwort allen,\r\n  Welche von der rechten Bahn\r\n    Auf verkehrten Weg verfallen!\r\n  Hier ist, was sie retten kann:\r\n  Jesus nimmt die Sünder an.\r\n\r\n                                   2.\r\n  Keiner Gnade sind wir wert,\r\n    Doch hat er in seinem Worte\r\n  Eidlich sich dazu erklärt\r\n    Sehet nur, die Gnadenpforte\r\n  Ist hier völlig aufgetan:\r\n  Jesus nimmt die Sünder an.\r\n\r\n                                   3.\r\n  Wenn ein Schaf verloren ist,\r\n    Suchet es ein treuer Hirte;\r\n  Jesus, der uns nie vergisst,\r\n    Suchet treulich das Verirrte,\r\n  Dass es nicht verderben kann:\r\n  Jesus nimmt die Sünder an.\r\n\r\n                                   4.\r\n  Kommet alle, kommet her,\r\n    Kommet, ihr betrübten Sünder!\r\n  Jesus rufet euch, und er\r\n    Macht aus Sündern Gottes Kinder.\r\n  Glaubet’s doch und denket dran:\r\n  Jesus nimmt die Sünder an.\r\n\r\n                                   5.\r\n  Ich Betrübter komme hier\r\n    Und bekenne meine Sünden.\r\n  Lass, mein Heiland, mich bei dir\r\n    Gnade zur Vergebung finden,\r\n  Dass dies Wort mich trösten kann:\r\n  Jesus nimmt die Sünder an.\r\n\r\n                                   6.\r\n  Ich bin ganz getrostes Muts.\r\n    Ob die Sünden blutrot wären,\r\n  Müssten sie kraft deines Bluts\r\n    Dennoch sich in Schneeweiss kehren\r\n  Da ich gläubig sprechen kann:\r\n  Jesus nimmt die Sünder an.\r\n\r\n                                   7.\r\n  Mein Gewissen beisst mich nicht,\r\n    Moses darf mich nicht verklagen;\r\n  Der mich frei und ledig spricht,\r\n    Hat die Schulden abgetragen,\r\n  Dass mich nichts verdammen kann:\r\n  Jesus nimmt die Sünder an.\r\n\r\n                                   8.\r\n  Jesus nimmt die Sünder an,\r\n    Mich hat er auch angenommen\r\n  Und den Himmel aufgetan,\r\n    Dass ich selig zu ihm kommen\r\n  Und auf den Trost sterben kann:\r\n  Jesus nimmt die Sünder an.\r\n\r\nThe four stanzas of our text correspond to stanzas 1, 4, 7, and 8 of the\r\noriginal. The translation is by Mrs. Emma Frances Beaven, 1827-1909,\r\nconcerning whom no biographical information has been traced. Her work\r\nwas altered somewhat to fit McGranahan’s tune.\r\n\r\nErdmann Neumeister was a distinguished student and afterwards lecturer\r\nat Leipzig University. Later he achieved fame as a court preacher and as\r\npastor of St. James’ Church, Hamburg. An eloquent preacher and a strong\r\nHigh Lutheran, he opposed the Moravians and the Pietists of his day,\r\nholding that their teachings were too subjective. Besides being a gifted\r\npreacher, he was also a musician of ability and eminence. He originated\r\nthe cantata form of church music and composed a number of works in that\r\nform. He is the author of 650 hymns, many of them of the highest rank\r\nand still in general use in Germany though only a few have been\r\ntranslated into English.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NEUMEISTER. For comments on the composer of this popular gospel\r\ntune with its change of rhythm in the refrain, James McGranahan, see\r\nHymn 450.\r\n\r\nThe German words are set to the tune, “_Grosser Gott wir loben Dich_” in\r\nthe _Gesangbuch mit Noten_.\r\n\r\n\r\n467. The whole world was lost                 _Philip P. Bliss_, 1838-76\r\n\r\nBased on the incident in John 9, in which Jesus restored the sight to\r\nthe man born blind, and the saying of Jesus, “I am the light of the\r\nworld” (John 9:5).\r\n\r\nFor comments on Philip P. Bliss, author and composer, see Hymn 442.\r\n\r\n\r\n468. Jesus, my all, to heaven is gone            _John Cennick_, 1718-55\r\n\r\nA hymn which has had wide use in prayer-meeting and camp-meeting\r\nassemblies. A hearty unison “crescendo” on the last stanza is\r\nimpressive:\r\n\r\n  “Then will I tell to sinners round\r\n  What a dear Savior I have found;\r\n  I’ll point to His redeeming blood,\r\n  And say, ‘Behold, the way to God.’”\r\n\r\nThe author had known the joy of finding Christ and his hymn reflects his\r\npersonal experience. While frequenting London, as a youth, in a vain\r\nsearch for employment,\r\n\r\n  He became addicted, in consequence, to sight-seeing, song-singing,\r\n  play-going, card-playing, horse-racing, ball-frequenting, and the\r\n  like. But on an Easter visit to London, in 1735, he was seriously\r\n  impressed as he was walking hastily in Cheapside. He became greatly\r\n  distressed on account of his sins, broke off from his sinful course,\r\n  and walked softly before God; but he found no peace until September 6,\r\n  1737, in his nineteenth year, when he was enabled to trust in Christ\r\n  alone and find joy and peace in believing.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on John Cennick, see Hymn 130.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DUANE STREET, a stirring revival tune, was composed by Rev.\r\nGeorge Coles, in 1835, for one of James Montgomery’s hymns, but has been\r\nassociated with this hymn for many years.\r\n\r\nGeorge Coles, 1792-1858, was born in Stewkley, England, and died in New\r\nYork City. He came to America as a young man and spent all his life in\r\nthe Methodist ministry. He was editor of the _New York Christian\r\nAdvocate_ and the _Sunday School Advocate_, for some years, and was a\r\ncomposer of ability, besides being a good singer.\r\n\r\n\r\n469. Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole     _James Nicholson, 19th\r\n                                                                  cent._\r\n\r\nA hymn that has brought joy and release to many sin-burdened souls,\r\nespecially encouraging with its promise in stanza 4:\r\n\r\n  “To those who have sought Thee\r\n  Thou never saidst, No.”\r\n\r\nIt is built around the verse\r\n\r\n  “Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow” (Psalm 51:7).\r\n\r\nThe hymn appeared in Sankey’s _Songs and Solos_.\r\n\r\nThe author, James Nicholson, was an American Methodist minister of the\r\n19th century.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FISCHER. The composer, William Gustavus Fischer, 1835-1912, was\r\nborn in Baltimore, Md. Moving to Philadelphia in early life, he received\r\na good musical education and became a teacher of piano and singing, and\r\nconductor of choral groups and Welsh singing societies in that city. For\r\nten years he was Professor of Music at Girard College, and at the same\r\ntime became associated with J. E. Gould in a flourishing piano business,\r\nunder the firm name of Gould and Fischer. In 1876, he led the Moody and\r\nSankey choir in the great building at Thirteenth and Market Streets in\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\n470. O Thou, in whose presence my soul takes delight     _Joseph Swain_,\r\n                                                                 1761-96\r\n\r\nSwain entitled this hymn, “A Description of Christ by His Grace and\r\nPower,” which was suggested to him by the description of the “Shepherd”\r\nin Solomon’s Song 1:7. The original poem has nine stanzas of eight lines\r\neach.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, John Swain, see Hymn 323.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MY BELOVED, also called “Beloved” and “Meditation,” is of\r\nuncertain origin. It appeared in a book, _The Beauties of Harmony_,\r\ncompiled by Freeman Lewis in 1813 and was arranged by Hubert P. Main in\r\n1869. Lewis, 1780-1859, was by profession a surveyor at Uniontown, Pa.\r\nMusic was his avocation.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Hubert P. Main see Hymn 426.\r\n\r\n\r\n471. I do not ask, O Lord, that life may be       _Adelaide A. Proctor_,\r\n                                                                 1825-64\r\n\r\nA hymn reflecting the quiet strength resulting from faith and trust in\r\nGod. It is the most admired of Miss Proctor’s hymns.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Adelaide Anne Proctor, see Hymn 177.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SUBMISSION, a tune well suited to the meaning and spirit of the\r\npoem, was composed for this hymn.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Albert L. Peace, see Hymn 175.\r\n\r\n\r\n472. More love to Thee, O Christ           _Elizabeth Prentiss_, 1818-78\r\n\r\nA simple prayer put into verse, written hastily, as many hymns have\r\nbeen, and, after some years, printed as a leaflet. It was then included\r\nby Dr. Doane in his _Songs of Devotion_, in four stanzas, the third\r\nbeing omitted here. In form and sentiment, the hymn is an echo of\r\n“Nearer, my God, to Thee,” and is more explicitly Christian, for the\r\nlatter omits the name of Christ completely.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Payson Prentiss was born in Portland, Maine, the daughter of\r\nthe famous minister, Rev. Edward Payson. After teaching school for some\r\nyears, she married Dr. George L. Prentiss, eminent Presbyterian\r\nclergyman, and professor at Union Theological Seminary in New York City,\r\nwho published her _Life and Letters_ soon after her death. Mrs. Prentiss\r\nwrote poetry and prose for the _Youths’ Companion_ and published several\r\nvolumes of poems.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MORE LOVE TO THEE was written for this hymn and published in\r\nDr. Doane’s _Songs of Devotion_, 1870.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Wm. Howard Doane see Hymn 313.\r\n\r\n\r\n473. What a wonderful Savior                         _Elisha A. Hoffman_\r\n\r\nA hymn on the atonement.\r\n\r\nWords and music are by the Rev. Elisha A. Hoffman.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Hoffman, see Hymn 464.\r\n\r\n\r\n474. Pass me not, O gentle Savior           _Fanny J. Crosby_, 1820-1915\r\n\r\nOne of Fanny Crosby’s best and most popular songs. Ira D. Sankey says of\r\nit: “No hymn in our collection was more popular than this at our\r\nmeetings in London in 1874.” Miss Crosby wrote it in 1868 at the request\r\nof Dr. W. H. Doane, who gave her the first line as a theme. Doane\r\npublished the hymn in his _Songs of Devotion_, 1870.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Fanny Crosby see Hymn 313.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PASS ME NOT was written for this hymn. For comments on the\r\ncomposer, W. H. Doane, see Hymn 313.\r\n\r\n\r\n475. I am Thine, O Lord                     _Fanny J. Crosby_, 1820-1915\r\n\r\nA song of consecration, based on Heb. 10:22, “Let us draw near with a\r\ntrue heart.” It was written one evening while Miss Crosby was visiting\r\nin the home of Dr. William H. Doane in Cincinnati, Ohio. The latter\r\ncomposed for it the tune by which the song has become familiar to a\r\nmultitude of worshippers.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Fanny Crosby and W. H. Doane see Hymn 313.\r\n\r\n\r\n476. Are you weary, are you heavy-hearted          _Jeremiah E. Rankin_,\r\n                                                               1828-1904\r\n\r\nA song that has touched many a burdened heart, written by the author of\r\n“God be with you till we meet again.” For comments on Jeremiah E.\r\nRankin, see Hymn 365.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ TELL IT TO JESUS. For comments on the composer, E. S. Lorenz,\r\nsee Hymn 439.\r\n\r\n\r\n477. Yield not to temptation              _Horatio R. Palmer_, 1834-1907\r\n\r\nA song that has been a source of strength to many in time of temptation.\r\n\r\nThe words and tune are by Horatio Richmond Palmer, Mus. Doc., an\r\nAmerican musician born at Sherburne, New York. He studied music in\r\nBerlin and Florence and became the director of the Rushford Academy of\r\nMusic, New York, in 1857. In 1884, he took charge of the Church Choral\r\nUnion in New York, an organization which grew to a membership of 4,000\r\nsingers devoted to the improvement of church music. He was dean, for a\r\ntime, of the school of music at Chautauqua, N. Y., and compiled a number\r\nof popular choral collections. He is the author of _A Theory of Music_\r\nand _A Manual for Teachers_.\r\n\r\nConcerning the composition of this hymn and tune, Dr. Palmer wrote:\r\n\r\n  This song is an inspiration. I was at work on the dry subject of\r\n  “Theory” when the complete idea flashed upon me, and I laid aside the\r\n  theoretical work and hurriedly penned both words and music as fast as\r\n  I could write them. I submitted them to the criticism of a friend\r\n  afterward, and some changes were made in the third stanza, but the\r\n  first two are exactly as they came to me. The music was first written\r\n  in A flat; but I soon saw that B flat was better, and for many years\r\n  it has appeared in that key. I am reverently thankful it has been a\r\n  power for good.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ YIELD NOT TO TEMPTATION. The tune, composed for the hymn by Dr.\r\nPalmer himself, appeared in _Sabbath School Songs_ (1868). It is also\r\nnamed “Fortitude.”\r\n\r\n\r\n478. He leadeth me, O blessed thought     _Joseph H. Gilmore_, 1834-1918\r\n\r\nA widely used hymn, based on Psalm 23:2: “He leadeth me beside the still\r\nwaters.” “It has the true hymn quality, combining all the simplicity of\r\nspontaneous thought and feeling with perfect accent and liquid rhythm”\r\n(Brown and Butterworth).\r\n\r\nJoseph Henry Gilmore, a Baptist minister, was born in Boston, the son of\r\nJoseph A. Gilmore. He graduated from Brown University in 1858 and from\r\nNewton Theological Seminary in 1861. In 1863-64 he served as private\r\nsecretary to his father, then governor of New Hampshire. From 1865 to\r\n1867, he was pastor of the Second Baptist Church at Rochester, N. Y.,\r\nand Acting Professor of Hebrew in Rochester Theological Seminary,\r\n1867-68. In 1868, he became Professor of Logic, Rhetoric, and English\r\nLiterature in the University of Rochester, a position he held for about\r\nforty years. One of his published volumes is _Outlines of English and\r\nAmerican Literature_, 1905.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was written after Dr. Gilmore had conducted the Wednesday\r\nevening service at the First Baptist Church, Philadelphia, where he\r\nexpounded the twenty-third Psalm. After the service, the discussion of\r\nthe subject was continued in the home where he was stopping. The author\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  During the conversation, the blessedness of God’s leadership so grew\r\n  upon me that I took out my pencil, wrote the hymn just as it stands\r\n  today, handed it to my wife, and thought no more about it. She sent\r\n  it, without my knowledge, to the _Watchman and Reflector_. Three years\r\n  later, I went to Rochester to preach for the Second Baptist Church. On\r\n  entering the chapel, I took up a hymn book, thinking: “I wonder what\r\n  they sing.” The book opened at “He Leadeth Me,” and that was the first\r\n  I knew my hymn had found a place among the songs of the Church.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HE LEADETH ME. Finding the hymn in a Christian periodical,\r\nBradbury composed for it this popular tune with which it has since been\r\nassociated. In singing the tune, holds should be observed at the end of\r\nlines 2, 3, and 4 of the stanzas, and at the end of lines 2 and 4 of the\r\nrefrain. “Few composers have so exactly caught the tone and spirit of\r\ntheir text as Bradbury did when he vocalized the gliding measures of ‘He\r\nLeadeth Me.’”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Wm. Bradbury, see Hymn 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n479. Joys are flowing like a river                      _M. P. Ferguson_\r\n\r\nA song of comfort and joy useful for the quiet hour. The presence of\r\nJesus brings to the trusting soul a blessed quietness as it did to the\r\ndisciples on the stormy lake when He awoke and spoke the word of peace\r\n(Mark 4:37-41).\r\n\r\nNo information has been traced concerning the author of the words, M. P.\r\nFerguson, or the composer, W. S. Marshall, from whose work the tune is\r\nan arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n480. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine       _Fanny J. Crosby_, 1820-1915\r\n\r\nAnother of Fanny Crosby’s fine lyrics, sung the world over, in which is\r\nrevealed the secret of the author’s own serene trust and cheerful faith.\r\nIn her _Memories of Eighty Years_, Miss Crosby makes the following\r\nreference to this hymn:\r\n\r\n  Often I take in my mind some tune already well known as a model or,\r\n  perhaps, more accurately speaking, as a guide, and work to it. This,\r\n  however, does not imply that the tune will ultimately be chosen as the\r\n  companion of the words; for it has probably already its own true and\r\n  lawful mate, with which it is to be happy and useful. Sometimes a tune\r\n  is furnished me for which to write the words. The hymn titled “Blessed\r\n  Assurance” was made in this manner. My dear friend, Mrs. Joseph F.\r\n  Knapp, so well-known as a writer and singer of most excellent music\r\n  and as an aid and inspiration to all who knew her, had composed the\r\n  tune; and it seemed to me one of the sweetest I had heard for a long\r\n  time. She asked me to write a hymn for it, and I felt while bringing\r\n  the words and tones together that the air and the hymn were intended\r\n  for each other. In the many hundred times that I have heard it sung,\r\n  this opinion has been more and more confirmed.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Fanny Crosby, see Hymn 313.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ASSURANCE was written by Mrs. Joseph Fairchild Knapp,\r\n1839-1908, the daughter of Dr. Walter and Mrs. Phoebe Palmer. Her\r\nhusband was the founder of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in\r\nNew York City. Both Mr. and Mrs. Knapp were members of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal church and gave much of their wealth to charitable and\r\nreligious work. Mrs. Knapp, a close friend of Fanny Crosby, was an\r\nexcellent singer, an accomplished organist, and an earnest Christian\r\nworker.\r\n\r\n\r\n481. Sweet are the promises                      _Wm. A. Ogden_, 1841-97\r\n\r\nThe third stanza is based on Matt. 11:28: “Come unto me, all ye that\r\nlabor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,” but the author has\r\nsubstituted “weary” for the word “labor.”\r\n\r\nWm. A. Ogden, who wrote the words and music of this song, was born in\r\nFranklin County, Ohio. At the age of six, he moved with his parents to\r\nIndiana where he enlisted, at the outbreak of the Civil War, in the 13th\r\nIndiana Volunteer Infantry. After the close of the war, he resumed his\r\nmusical studies under Lowell Mason, Thomas Hastings, E. E. Bailey, and\r\nB. F. Baker, President of the Boston School of Music. In 1870, he\r\npublished _Silver Song_ which reached the enormous sale of 500,000\r\ncopies. Ogden won distinction as a teacher and conductor of large\r\nconvention choruses. For six years he was director of music at Iowa\r\nNormal School but his greatest musical work was done at Toledo, Ohio,\r\nwhere he moved in 1881 and served as superintendent of public school\r\nmusic from 1887 until his death. He loved children and enjoyed teaching\r\nthem. His training of 3,000 children in 1894 was the distinct triumph of\r\nthe great _Saengerfest_ held that year in Toledo. Ogden wrote scores of\r\npopular songs, always composing both the words and music.\r\n\r\n\r\n482. Will your anchor hold            _Priscilla J. Owens_, 1829-_c._ 99\r\n\r\nA hymn setting forth life in terms of the sea and its billowing waves,\r\nand the confidence one may have if anchored to the Rock, which is\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Priscilla Jane Owens, and the composer of\r\nthe tune, William J. Kirkpatrick, 1838-1921, see Hymn 334.\r\n\r\n\r\n483. Hide me, O my Savior, hide me          _Fanny J. Crosby_, 1820-1915\r\n\r\nFor comments on Fanny Crosby and Wm. H. Doane who wrote tunes for many\r\nof Miss Crosby’s hymns, see Hymn 313.\r\n\r\n\r\n484. When peace, like a river, attendeth my way              _Horatio G.\r\n                                                      Spafford_, 1828-88\r\n\r\nA hymn of resignation and submission, written out of bitter experiences\r\nof loss and suffering.\r\n\r\nHoratio Gates Spafford, born in New York State, was a lawyer who had\r\nestablished himself in Chicago. He lost most of his fortune during the\r\ngreat fire in that city. Then on November 22, 1873, to add to his\r\ntrials, he lost four of his children when the French steamer, “Villa de\r\nHavre,” on which Mrs. Spafford and the children were sailing for Europe,\r\nsank in mid-ocean, half an hour after colliding with a large sailing\r\nvessel. Mrs. Spafford was rescued and, landing at Cardiff, Wales, ten\r\ndays later, cabled her husband, “Saved Alone.” Spafford started\r\nimmediately for Europe to bring his wife to Chicago. D. L. Moody, under\r\nwhose preaching the Spafford children had been converted in North\r\nChicago shortly before sailing, travelled from Edinburgh to Liverpool to\r\ncomfort the bereaved parents and was pleased to hear them say, “It is\r\nwell: the will of God be done.”\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Spafford later became much interested in the second coming\r\nof Christ, becoming so enthusiastic that in 1881 they went to Jerusalem\r\nwith their remaining daughter, to witness the coming of the Lord. After\r\nseven years in Palestine, Spafford died there, September 5, 1888, his\r\nwidow continuing to live there as the head of a communistic society with\r\nheadquarters in a building outside of Jerusalem. The daughter, very\r\npopular among the natives, became the teacher of a large body of\r\nchildren, instructing them in English and in American ways.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ IT IS WELL WITH MY SOUL. The music, “a gentle, gliding melody\r\nthat suits the mood of the words,” was written especially for Spafford’s\r\nwords and published in _Gospel Hymns No. 3_. The hymn and tune\r\nimmediately became popular.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, P. P. Bliss, see Hymn 442.\r\n\r\n\r\n485. Take the name of Jesus with you             _Lydia Baxter_, 1809-74\r\n\r\nA popular gospel song widely used in the Moody and Sankey revivals.\r\n\r\nLydia Baxter, born in Petersburg, New York, was converted under the\r\npreaching of a Baptist missionary, the Rev. Eben Tucker, and, with her\r\nsister, became a leader in the organization of a Baptist Church in her\r\nnative town. After her marriage she moved to New York City. Though an\r\ninvalid for many years, she was known for her astonishing cheerfulness\r\nand to her home came many a Christian worker for inspiration and advice.\r\nA volume of her poems, _Gems by the Wayside_, was published in 1855.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PRECIOUS NAME was written for this hymn. It is inseparably\r\nassociated with these words and has done much to give the hymn the\r\nwidespread popularity which it enjoys.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, W. H. Doane, also a Baptist, see Hymn 313.\r\n\r\n\r\n486. When we walk with the Lord               _James H. Sammis_, d. 1919\r\n\r\nThe origin of this hymn is related in Ira Sankey’s _Story of the Gospel\r\nHymns_:\r\n\r\n  “Some years ago,” says Professor Towner, musical director of Moody\r\n  Bible Institute, “Mr. Moody was conducting a series of meetings in\r\n  Brockton, Mass., and I had the pleasure of singing for him there. One\r\n  night a young man rose in a testimony meeting and said, ‘I am not\r\n  quite sure—but I am going to trust and obey.’ I just jotted that\r\n  sentence down, and sent it with the little story to the Rev. J. H.\r\n  Sammis, a Presbyterian minister. He wrote the hymn and the tune was\r\n  born. The chorus,\r\n\r\n  ‘Trust and obey\r\n  For there’s no other way\r\n  To be happy in Jesus\r\n  But to trust and obey.’\r\n\r\n  was written before the hymn was.”\r\n\r\nJames H. Sammis was born in Brooklyn, N. Y., and became a business man\r\nin Logansport, Indiana. As an active Christian layman, he was much\r\ninterested in the Young Men’s Christian Association, and finally gave up\r\nhis business connections to serve as a General Secretary in the “Y”.\r\nAfter further education at Lane and McCormick Seminaries, he entered the\r\nministry and served as pastor of Presbyterian churches in Indiana,\r\nMichigan, and Minnesota. In 1909, he went to California as a teacher in\r\nthe Bible Institute of Los Angeles, continuing there until his death,\r\nJune 12, 1919.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ TRUST AND OBEY. The composer of this tune, D. W. Towner,\r\n1850-1919, was born in Rome, Pa., and became a member of a group of\r\nsingers and evangelists associated with D. L. Moody. He was a capable\r\nleader of choirs and large assemblies. In 1893, he became director of\r\nthe musical department of Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, a position\r\nhe held until his death. In recognition of his services, the University\r\nof Tennessee honored him with the degree of Doctor of Music, in 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n487. My hope is built on nothing less           _Edward Mote_, 1797-1874\r\n\r\n“A grand hymn of faith” is the characterization given by Bishop\r\nBickersteth of this poem. Written in 1834, and printed as a leaflet, it\r\nwas later included in the author’s _Hymns of Praise_, 1836, entitled,\r\n“The Immutable Basis of a Sinner’s Hope.” The hymn is reminiscent of the\r\nwords of Paul: “Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which\r\nis Jesus Christ” (I Cor. 3:11).\r\n\r\nEdward Mote, born in London, worked as a cabinet-maker for some years\r\nbut at length entered the ministry and from 1852 until his death in 1874\r\nserved the Baptist Church at Horsham, Essex.\r\n\r\nThe refrain of this hymn came into his mind one morning as he was\r\nwalking up Holborn Hill on his way to work. Four stanzas were completed\r\nthat day and two more were added the following Sunday.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SOLID ROCK. For comments on the composer of this tune, Wm. B.\r\nBradbury, see Hymn 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n488. ’Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus                _Louisa M. R. Stead_\r\n\r\nA hymn of simple trust. Information concerning the author, Louisa M. R.\r\nStead, has not been traced.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ TRUSTING was composed for these words by the gospel singer and\r\ncomposer, Wm. J. Kirkpatrick, 1838-1921.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Kirkpatrick see Hymn 334.\r\n\r\n\r\n489. What a fellowship, what a joy divine            _Elisha A. Hoffman_\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Elisha A. Hoffman, see Hymn 464.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LEANING ON JESUS was composed by Anthony J. Schowalter, who was\r\nborn at Cherry Grove, Pa., May 1, 1858. The following from his pen tells\r\nthe story of the origin of this hymn and tune:\r\n\r\n  While I was conducting a singing-school at Hartsells, Alabama, I\r\n  received a letter from two of my former pupils in South Carolina,\r\n  conveying the sad intelligence that on the same day each of them had\r\n  buried a wife. I tried to console them by writing a letter that might\r\n  prove helpful in their hour of sadness. Among other Scriptures, I\r\n  quoted this passage, “Underneath are the everlasting arms.” Before\r\n  completing the writing of the sentence, the thought came to me that\r\n  the fact that we may lean on these everlasting arms and find comfort\r\n  and strength, ought to be put in a song; and before finishing that\r\n  letter, the words and music of the refrain were written. The\r\n  manuscript was sent to Elisha Hoffman ... in a few days his completion\r\n  of the poem was received.\r\n\r\n\r\n490. Jesus, keep me near the cross          _Fanny J. Crosby_, 1820-1915\r\n\r\nA hymn on “the cross.” The refrain suggests the words of Paul: “God\r\nforbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ”\r\n(Gal. 6:14). This is another instance in which the words of the blind\r\nhymn writer and the music of Mr. Doane were combined to make a popular\r\ngospel song.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Fanny Crosby and Wm. H. Doane, composer of the tune, see\r\nHymn 313.\r\n\r\n\r\n491. Nearer the cross                          _Fanny Crosby_, 1820-1915\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author of these words, Fanny Crosby, see Hymn 313.\r\n\r\nFor Mrs. J. F. Knapp, composer of the tune, see Hymn 480.\r\n\r\n\r\n492. There is a fountain filled with blood   _William Cowper_, 1731-1800\r\n\r\nThe imagery in the first verse is drawn from Zechariah 13:1: “In that\r\nday there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the\r\ninhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.” The dislike which\r\nsome have for this Old Testament phraseology has given rise to much\r\ndispute concerning the hymn, but all attempts to revise it have been\r\nwithout success. It is excellent poetry and should be left as Cowper\r\nwrote it.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was published in Conger’s _Collection of Psalms and Hymns_,\r\n1772, and later in the _Olney Hymns_ (See Hymn 60).\r\n\r\nFor comments on William Cowper see Hymn 60.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CLEANSING FOUNTAIN, also called “Western Melody” in some of the\r\nolder books, is a stirring tune reminiscent of the early American camp\r\nmeeting songs. It is attributed here to Lowell Mason, but it is not\r\ncertain whether he wrote it or whether it is an adaptation from his\r\ntune, “Cowper,” which it resembles and to which the hymn is set in _The\r\nHymnal_, 1933 (Presbyterian).\r\n\r\nFor comments on Lowell Mason see Hymn 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n493. I love to tell the story              _Katherine Hankey_, 1834-1911\r\n\r\nA simple song which became popular and has been translated into several\r\ndifferent languages, because it expresses what is in the hearts of\r\nmultitudes of people.\r\n\r\nThe words are from a long poem of 50 stanzas, in two parts, on the life\r\nof Jesus. Part I, dated January 29, 1866, is entitled, “The Story\r\nWanted.” Part II, dated November 18, 1866, is entitled, “The Story\r\nTold.” The author composed the poem during a long period of convalescing\r\nafter a serious illness. This hymn and “Tell me the old, old story” (No.\r\n495) are selections from Part II and Part I, respectively, of the\r\nabove-mentioned poem.\r\n\r\nKatherine Hankey, born in Clapham, England, was the daughter of a\r\nbanker. She was a refined, consecrated woman, a Sunday school teacher,\r\nand organizer of Bible classes among working girls. She travelled in\r\nSouth Africa to look after an invalid brother and became so interested\r\nin mission work that she devoted thereto the income from her writings.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HANKEY was composed for these words. For comments on the\r\ncomposer, Wm. G. Fischer, see Hymn 469. The melody, written in 1869, was\r\nharmonized by Hubert P. Main (No. 426) and became popular at revival\r\nmeetings. It is one of the gospel song tunes that is included in the\r\nmore dignified church hymnals.\r\n\r\n\r\n494. Sing them over again to me               _Philip P. Bliss_, 1838-76\r\n\r\nWritten especially for use in the first issue of _Words of Life_, a\r\nSunday school paper published by Fleming H. Revell. Two years later,\r\nGeorge Stebbins introduced the song in an evangelistic campaign which he\r\nand Dr. Pentecost were conducting in New Haven, Conn., the two men\r\nsinging the song as a duet. The song was received with enthusiasm and\r\nimmediately became popular. It was published in _Gospel Hymns, No. 3_\r\nand has had a wide use in evangelistic services and in the Sunday\r\nschools throughout the country.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Philip P. Bliss, author and composer, see Hymn 442.\r\n\r\n\r\n495. Tell me the old, old story            _Katherine Hankey_, 1834-1911\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Katherine Hankey, and an account of the\r\norigin of this hymn, see Hymn 493.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ Dr. W. H. Doane heard the poem read at a Y.M.C.A. Conference at\r\nMontreal in 1867 and was so impressed by it that he copied it and later\r\nset it to music while riding on a stage coach during a vacation in the\r\nWhite Mountains.\r\n\r\nFor comments on W. H. Doane, see Hymn 313.\r\n\r\n\r\n496. There is a Name I love to hear     _Frederick Whitfield_, 1829-1904\r\n\r\nA hymn on the name of Jesus which was published in 1855 in hymn-sheets\r\nand leaflets in various languages. In 1861, it appeared in the author’s\r\n_Sacred Poems and Prose_, a volume containing twenty-six hymns.\r\n\r\nFrederick Whitfield, born at Threapwood, Shropshire, was a minister in\r\nthe Anglican Church. Educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he took\r\nhis B.A. degree in 1859, he became, successively, curate of Otley, vicar\r\nof Kirby-Ravensworth, senior curate of Greenwich, and vicar of St.\r\nJohn’s, Bexley. He is the author of nearly thirty volumes of prose and\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ O HOW I LOVE JESUS is a traditional melody of unknown\r\nauthorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n497. Rescue the perishing                   _Fanny J. Crosby_, 1820-1915\r\n\r\nA rallying song for Christian workers in all parts of the world. This is\r\nthe only one of Fanny Crosby’s hymns to be included in the famous\r\nEnglish publication, _Hymns Ancient and Modern_. It was a great favorite\r\nof Frances E. Willard and Frances Murphy, temperance crusaders, and D.\r\nL. Moody was very fond of it.\r\n\r\nThe hymn had its origin in a visit which the blind poet made to one of\r\nthe worst slum districts in New York City. When she addressed the men at\r\na rescue mission, Miss Crosby heard harrowing tales of lost and\r\nperishing people. She wrote:\r\n\r\n  “While I sat there that evening the line came to me, ‘Rescue the\r\n  perishing, care for the dying.’ I could think of nothing else that\r\n  night. When I arrived at my home, I went to work at once, and before I\r\n  retired the entire hymn was ready for a melody.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Fanny J. Crosby see Hymn 313.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ RESCUE was composed by Dr. Doane for this hymn. The hymn and\r\ntune have resounded through many thousands of mission services.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Wm. H. Doane see Hymn 313.\r\n\r\n\r\n498. O scatter seeds of loving deeds    _Jessie Brown Pounds_, 1861-1921\r\n\r\nFor comments on Jessie Brown Pounds, see Hymn 453.\r\n\r\nHer song poem has gone around the world on the wings of this tune\r\ncomposed by Fred A. Fillmore, of the musically famous Fillmore brothers.\r\nSee comments at Hymn 453. Fred A. was born May 15, 1856, at Paris,\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n499. Judge me, God of my salvation                            _Psalm 43_\r\n\r\nA metrical version of Psalm 43 which may be compared with the version\r\nfrom the Scottish Psalter at No. 587. The fifth verse of the Psalm is\r\nmade to serve as the refrain. The poet who made the version has not been\r\nidentified. The hymn and tune were taken from the _Psalter_ of the\r\nUnited Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ AMARA was composed by William O. Perkins, concerning whom no\r\ninformation has been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n500. I can hear my Savior calling                         _E. W. Blandy_\r\n\r\nAn intimate hymn of personal consecration. The repetition of the phrases\r\nand the close harmony of the music have made the use of this song, even\r\nwithout the aid of an accompanying instrument, easy and enjoyable. No\r\ninformation has been found concerning the author, E. W. Blandy\r\n(misspelled Blandly in the _Hymnary_).\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WHERE HE LEADS ME is admirably suited to the words. No\r\ninformation has come to light concerning the composer, J. S. Norris.\r\n\r\n\r\n501. And must I be to judgment brought         _Charles Wesley_, 1707-88\r\n\r\nThe hymn, originally in eight stanzas, was entitled “A Thought on\r\nJudgment” and was written for children! Why Wesley wrote such\r\nserious-minded hymns for children is explained in his preface to _Hymns\r\nfor Children_, from which this hymn is taken:\r\n\r\n  There are two ways of writing or speaking to children. The one is to\r\n  let ourselves down to them; the other, to lift them up to us. Dr.\r\n  Watts wrote in the former way, and has succeeded admirably well,\r\n  speaking to children as children and leaving them as he found them.\r\n  The following hymns are written on the other plan. They contain strong\r\n  and manly sense, yet expressed in such plain and easy language as even\r\n  children may understand. But when they do understand them, they will\r\n  be children no longer—only in years and in stature.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Charles Wesley, see Hymn 6.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MARLOW was composed by Rev. John Chetham, 1700-63, an English\r\nclergyman, curate of Skipton.\r\n\r\n\r\n502. Savior, lead me lest I stray              _Frank M. Davis_, 1839-96\r\n\r\nThe words and music were written on the deck of a steamer that plied\r\nbetween Baltimore and Savannah.\r\n\r\nFrank M. Davis was born on a farm near Marcellus, New York, the youngest\r\nof a family of ten children. He began composing tunes at an early age\r\nand became a teacher of vocal and instrumental music. He travelled\r\nextensively through the eastern and southern states, directing chorus\r\nchoirs and teaching vocal classes. He compiled several Sunday school\r\ncollections, among them _New Pearls of Song_, 1877, and _Notes of\r\nPraise_, of which more than 100,000 copies were sold. Davis is the\r\nauthor of over 100 vocal and instrumental compositions. He died suddenly\r\nof heart failure at Chesterfield, Indiana, where he was attending a camp\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n503. My days are gliding swiftly by            _David Nelson_, 1793-1844\r\n\r\nA hymn written by a preacher while hiding from pursuing slave-holders\r\nwhose anger and violence were aroused by Nelson’s aggressive\r\nanti-slavery views.\r\n\r\nDavid Nelson, a surgeon in the U. S. Army during the war of 1812, left\r\nhis profession to become a minister, meanwhile owning and operating a\r\nplantation in Missouri. After listening to an address on slavery, he\r\ndeclared himself in favor of freeing the slaves and advocated the plan\r\nof colonizing them in Africa. This so enraged some of the slave-holders\r\nthat they drove Nelson from his home. To avoid mob violence, he escaped,\r\nreaching, after three days and nights of wandering, the Mississippi\r\nRiver opposite Quincy, Illinois. Hiding there in the bushes, with his\r\npursuers near but unable to find him, the river gliding swiftly before\r\nhim, he wrote this hymn on the back of old letters he had in his pocket.\r\nHe was finally rescued by members of the Quincy Congregational Church\r\nwho, having learned of his plight, took him on a fishing canoe and rowed\r\nhim across the river, still pursued, to safety and friends, on the\r\nhospitable shore of a free state.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SHINING SHORE, one of the composer’s most popular tunes, has\r\nbeen given various arrangements for voice and instruments. Root has\r\nwritten concerning the origin of the tune:\r\n\r\n  One day, I remember, as I was working at a set of graded part-songs\r\n  for singing classes, mother passed through the room and laid a slip\r\n  from one of the religious newspapers before me, saying, “George, I\r\n  think that would be good for music.” I looked at the poem which began,\r\n  “My days are gliding swiftly by,” and a simple melody sang itself in\r\n  my mind as I read. I jotted it down and went on with my work. That was\r\n  the origin of the music of “The Shining Shore.” Later, when I took up\r\n  the melody to harmonize it, it seemed so very simple and commonplace,\r\n  that I hesitated about setting the other parts to it. I finally\r\n  decided that it might be useful to somebody, and I completed it,\r\n  though it was not printed until some months afterward. In after years\r\n  I examined it in an endeavor to account for its great popularity—but\r\n  in vain. To the musician there is not one reason in melody or harmony\r\n  scientifically regarded, for such a fact. To him hundreds of others,\r\n  now forgotten, were better.\r\n\r\nFor comments on George F. Root, 1820-95, see Hymn 418.\r\n\r\n\r\n504. There’s a land that is fairer than day     _S. F. Bennett_, 1836-98\r\n\r\n“It’ll be all right _by and by_.” This trivial remark by Webster, when\r\none morning, seemingly depressed, he was asked by his partner, Bennett,\r\nwhat was wrong with him, was the occasion for the writing of this hymn.\r\nThe author and composer were friends and partners in the music\r\npublishing business in the village of Elkhorn, Wis. Webster, the\r\nmusician of the firm, was inclined to be nervous and subject to periods\r\nof depression. His partner understood this and often effected a cure, as\r\non this occasion, by putting him to work on a new song. Upon Bennett’s\r\nsuggestion, the two agreed that morning to make a hymn out of the idea,\r\n“The sweet by and by.” Bennett penned the words and handed them to\r\nWebster, who promptly wrote the music. Words and music were thus\r\nproduced in the incredibly short time of about thirty minutes. The song\r\nwas published soon afterward in a Sunday school song book, _The Signet\r\nRing_, which the two men were compiling. From there it found its way\r\ninto numerous collections of songs until today “it is translated into\r\nvarious foreign languages and sung in every land under the sun.”\r\n\r\nSanford Filmore Bennett was a native of the West. He settled in Elkhorn,\r\nWis., in 1861, to devote himself to music but later studied medicine and\r\npracticed in Richmond, Ill.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SWEET BY AND BY. Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-75, composer of\r\nthis tune, was born in New Hampshire. He was an active member of the\r\nHandel and Haydn Society and various other musical organizations. He\r\nlived in Madison, Indiana, and Racine, Wisconsin, before finally moving\r\nto Elkhorn, in 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK IV\r\n                     The Christian Year in Chorales\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CALL TO WORSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\n505.

He\r\nwas ordained to become his father’s assistant in the church at\r\nBrauchitzchdorf, his birthplace. Later he became the pastor of\r\nFriedenskirche at Schweidnitz, in Silesia, where he labored patiently\r\nfor a period of 35 years, beloved of his people for his understanding\r\nand sympathy. He had rare poetic gifts and published a number of volumes\r\nof devotional books in which his hymns were included. His contemporary,\r\nJohann Sebastian Bach, 1685-1750, greatest of all church musicians,\r\nhelped to make the poems of Schmolck immortal.\r\n\r\nCatherine Winkworth translated five stanzas of this hymn; three of which\r\nare used here.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Miss Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NEANDER.

He was educated at the\r\ngrammar school of his native place, and then bound as an apprentice to\r\nan elder brother, a shop-keeper at Mülheim. When his time was out, he\r\nleft his brother and moved to a little cottage near Mülheim where for\r\nsome years he supported himself by weaving silk ribbons, giving his\r\nmoney to the poor, and living a life so simple that it brought upon him\r\nthe contempt of his thriving and money-getting relatives. For a time,\r\ndue to various disappointments, he lived in a “state of darkness,” a\r\nfive year period of spiritual depression, during which he doubted the\r\nlove, if not the existence, of God. He at last, as in a moment, regained\r\npeace and joy, whereupon he signed, with his own blood, a covenant with\r\nGod to devote himself to His service. Soon he was found speaking at\r\nprayer meetings and other places and became popular as a religious\r\nteacher and counsellor. From far and wide people came to him for\r\npersonal interviews, and his public meetings were always crowded.\r\n\r\nTersteegen was never ordained. Grieved by the open sin of the church\r\npeople of his time, he early dissociated himself from the organized\r\nchurch and absented himself from the communion service. Though he had a\r\nwide following, he never organized a sect of his own, and, after his\r\ndeath, most of his disciples reunited with the Reformed Church. Like all\r\ngreat leaders, he pled the cause of the underprivileged. He was a mystic\r\nof the purest type, yet his faith was practical. He provided food and\r\nsimple medicines for the poor and became widely known as the physician\r\nto the poor and forsaken. Tersteegen had many friends among the\r\nMennonites and often preached in their church at Krefeld.\r\n\r\nHe is the author of 111 hymns, many of which have been rendered into\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nFrederick Foster and John Miller, translators of stanzas one and two,\r\nrespectively, were both members of the Moravian Church. William Mercer,\r\ntranslator of stanza three, was an English scholar who translated and\r\nparaphrased many of the Latin and German hymns into English, but is best\r\nknown for his successful work as editor of _The Church Psalter and Hymn\r\nBook_, 1857, the most popular hymn book of the Church of England.\r\nAnother translation of this hymn appears at No. 508.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ARNSBERG, also called “Wunderbarer König,” and “Gott ist\r\ngegenwärtig,” was composed by the poet and musician, Joachim Neander,\r\n1650-80. It appeared in his collection, _Glaub- und Liebesübung_,\r\nBremen, 1680, set to the hymn, “Wunderbarer König.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Neander see Hymn 127.\r\n\r\n\r\n507. Jehovah! Jehovah!

Halleluja!\r\n\r\nThe original is a one-stanza hymn. The author, Gottlieb Pfeffel, was\r\nborn at Colmar in Alsace. His literary work consisted primarily of the\r\nwriting of fables and hymns for instruction in the Colmar schools. At\r\nthe age of 21 he became totally blind, but carried on, despite the\r\nhandicap, a magnificent life work as president of the schools at Colmar.\r\nHe was also the founder of a nursery for Protestant children.\r\n\r\nChristian George Haas, translator of the hymn, was a minister in the\r\nEvangelical Church. After graduating from Eden Theological Seminary, he\r\nheld pastorates in St. Paul and in Buffalo, and edited the _Hymnal of\r\nthe Evangelical Church_, 1898.\r\n\r\nTwo stanzas were added to Pfeffel’s hymn, by G. F. W. Schultz:\r\n\r\n  Sohn Gottes! Sohn Gottes! Sohn Gottes!\r\n  Deinen Namen preist unser Lobgesang!\r\n      Amen. Amen.\r\n  Du kamst aus Lieb’ zu uns herab,\r\n  Siegtest über Tod und Grab,\r\n  Alle zu erlösen,\r\n  O Heiland, Heiland, Heiland, vom Bösen!\r\n      Sei hochgelobt!

The German version and\r\nanother translation are found at No. 506.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Tersteegen see Hymn 506.\r\n\r\nThe present translation was made by John Wesley, the founder of\r\nMethodism. For comments on Wesley see Hymn 170.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MACH’S MIT MIR GOTT, also called “Schein,” and “Eisenach,” was\r\ncomposed by J. H. Schein, 1586-1630, for the hymn “Mach’s mit mir Gott.”\r\nSchein was the son of a Lutheran pastor and became one of the most\r\ndistinguished musicians of his time. For a number of years he held the\r\nhonored position of cantor of St. Thomas’ Church and School in Leipzig,\r\nand composed many hymn tunes. He is best known by the great hymn book he\r\nedited for the Lutheran Church, _Cantional, oder Gesangbuch\r\nAugsburgischer Confession_, Leipzig, 1627.\r\n\r\nThe present form of the melody is an adaptation of the original and is\r\nthe one used by J. S. Bach in his _St. John’s Passion_. “The tune is not\r\none of the ‘grand’ chorales, but retains, even in its later version, a\r\nsuave, song-like character.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PRAISE\r\n\r\n\r\n509.

Our version is a\r\nselection of stanzas 1, 4, 5, and 15, of the original 15.\r\n\r\nThe author, Johann Mentzer, was for 38 years a pastor at Kemnitz,\r\nSaxony, and belonged to the more conservative Pietistic school of hymn\r\nwriters. He is the author of 34 hymns, many of them of high merit.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, Catherine Winkworth, see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ O DASS ICH TAUSEND ZUNGEN HÄTTE was composed by Johann\r\nBalthasar König, 1691-1758, director of music in several churches in\r\nFrankfurt-am-Main. The tune appeared in _Harmonischer Liederschatz_,\r\nFrankfurt, 1738, where it is set to the hymn, “Ach sagt mir nichts von\r\nGold und Schätzen.” The _Harmonischer Liederschatz_, edited by König, is\r\nthe most comprehensive chorale-book of the 18th century. It contains\r\n1940 tunes, including several of König’s own compositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n510. Heav’n and earth, the sea, the air       _Joachim Neander_, 1650-80\r\n                                      _Tr. Catherine Winkworth_, 1829-78\r\n                                                  _Frances Cox_, 1812-97\r\n\r\n                                   1.\r\n  Himmel, Erde, Luft und Meer,\r\n  Aller Welten zahllos Heer\r\n  Jauchzen Gott, dem Schöpfer, zu;\r\n  Meine Seele, sing’ auch du!\r\n\r\n                                   2.\r\n  Ihn erhebt das Sonnenlicht,\r\n  Wann es durch die Wolken bricht.\r\n  Mondesglanz und Sternenpracht\r\n  Loben Gott in stiller Nacht.\r\n\r\n                                   3.\r\n  Seht, wie er das Land erquickt\r\n  Und mit Luft und Segen schmückt!\r\n  Wälder, Flur und jedes Tier\r\n  Zeigen Gottes Finger hier.—\r\n\r\n                                   4.\r\n  Seht, wie fleugt der Vögel Schaar\r\n  In den Lüften frisch und klar!\r\n  Donner, Blitz, Dampf, Hagel, Wind\r\n  Seines Willens Diener sind.\r\n\r\n                                   5.\r\n  Seht der Wasserwellen Lauf,\r\n  Wie sie steigen ab und auf!\r\n  Von der Quelle bis zum Meer\r\n  Rauschen sie des Schöpfers Ehr’.\r\n\r\n                                   6.\r\n  Ach, mein Gott, wie wunderbar\r\n  Stellst du dich der Seele dar!\r\n  Drücke stets in meinen Sinn,\r\n  Was du bist, und was ich bin!\r\n\r\nBased on Psalm 19 and Acts 14:17. The hymn sings of God’s revelation to\r\nman in nature. It once had a footnote: “Is also a traveler’s hymn by\r\nland and water,” to which we might add, “and air.” The hymn first\r\nappeared in the author’s _Glaub- und Liebesübung_, Bremen, 1680.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Joachim Neander see Hymn 127.\r\n\r\nThe translation is mainly from Catherine Winkworth, but partly from\r\nFrances Cox.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Miss Winkworth see Hymn 236. For Miss Cox, Hymn 512.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GOTT SEI DANK, also known as “Lübeck,” “Berlin,” and\r\n“Carintha,” is by an unknown composer. The tune, since slightly altered,\r\nfirst appeared in J. A. Freylinghausen’s _Neues Geistreiches\r\nGesangbuch_, Halle, 1704, an important collection described as “the only\r\nbook which can, as a collection, be set alongside with _Praxis Pietatis\r\nMelica_.” It is a lively, spirited tune, its moderate range making it\r\nespecially suitable for unison singing.\r\n\r\n\r\n511. Lord, with glowing heart I’d praise Thee       _Francis Scott Key_,\r\n                                                               1779-1843\r\n\r\nThe author of this hymn, Francis Scott Key, is known to every American\r\nchild as the man who wrote our national anthem, “The Star Spangled\r\nBanner.” Born in Frederick County, Virginia, he was educated at St.\r\nJohn’s College, Annapolis. He practiced law in Washington, D. C., and\r\nserved as United States District Attorney for three terms, till his\r\ndeath on January 11, 1843. As a member of the Protestant Episcopal\r\nChurch, he held a lay reader’s license and for many years read the\r\nservice and visited the sick. He taught a Bible class and conducted\r\nfamily prayers twice a day, requiring all members of the household,\r\nincluding the servants, to be present. He did much for the negroes of\r\nthe south and although he lived in a slave state, he was moved by\r\nconscientious scruples to free his own slaves. The hymn, as he wrote it,\r\nhad four stanzas. The second and third stanzas, omitted here, read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Praise, my soul, the God that sought thee,\r\n    Wretched wanderer, far astray;\r\n  Found thee lost, and kindly brought thee\r\n    From the paths of death away;\r\n  Praise, with love’s devoutest feeling,\r\n    Him who saw thy guilt-born fear,\r\n  And, the light of hope revealing,\r\n    Bade the blood-stained cross appear.\r\n\r\n  Praise thy Saviour God that drew thee\r\n    To that cross, new life to give,\r\n  Held a blood-sealed pardon to thee,\r\n    Bade thee look to Him and live.\r\n  Praise the grace whose threats alarmed thee,\r\n    Roused thee from thy fatal ease,\r\n  Praise the grace whose promise warmed thee,\r\n    Praise the grace that whispered peace.\r\n\r\nAmong his other hymns is, “Before the Lord we bow,” a thanksgiving hymn\r\nwritten by Key in 1832 for a Fourth of July celebration.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WOMIT SOLL ICH DICH WOHL LOBEN is by Justin H. Knecht,\r\n1752-1817, who was born in Biberach, Swabia. He studied music under\r\nKramer and became one of the great organists of his time. His most\r\nvaluable production was the _Württemberg Choralbuch_ which he edited\r\nalong with J. F. Christmann, and to which he contributed 97 tunes of his\r\nown composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n512.

Our hymn is a translation of stanzas 1, 3, 5, and 7 of\r\nthe original.\r\n\r\nThe author, Johann Jakob Schütz, born at Frankfurt-am-Main, was a lawyer\r\nby profession. He was a man of deep religious convictions and a close\r\nfriend of P. J. Spener and Joachim Neander, early leaders of the Pietist\r\nmovement in Germany. Schütz left the Lutheran church and became a\r\nseparatist. He died at Frankfurt-am-Main.\r\n\r\nThe translation is by Frances Cox, 1812-97, an English woman of culture\r\nand learning who is second only to Catherine Winkworth as a translator\r\nof German hymns.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MIT FREUDEN ZART, one of our finest hymn tunes, was used by the\r\nBohemian Brethren, and is probably much older than their _Gesangbuch_ of\r\n1566 in which it first appeared. The tune is a joyous one, as the name\r\nindicates, and should not be sung too slowly.

The translation here given is a free rendering of\r\nstanzas 1 and 8, and was made especially for the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\nThe author of this hymn, Johann Daniel Herrnschmidt, a learned and\r\ndevout man, was born in Bopfingen, in Württemberg, where his father was\r\npastor. He was a pupil and for a time assistant of pastor August Francke\r\nin Halle. Later he became minister in Bopfingen, then superintendent and\r\ncouncilman at Nassau-Idstein. In 1715 he became teacher and pastor in\r\nHalle where he died 8 years later.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LOBE DEN HERREN, O MEINE SEELE, inseparably united with this\r\nhymn, is one of the most brilliant and striking gems in our chorale\r\ntreasury. The composer is unknown. The tune first appeared in _Anhang\r\nder Seelen-Harpff_, Onolzbach, 1665, and later in Freylinghausen’s\r\n_Gesangbuch_, 1714.\r\n\r\n\r\n514. Now thank we all our God                _Martin Rinkart_, 1586-1649\r\n                                      _Tr.

It is the most celebrated hymn coming out of\r\nthe second period (1570-1648) of German hymnody.\r\n\r\nThe first two stanzas of the hymn were composed as a _Tischlied_, a\r\ngrace after meat, to be sung by the author’s household. The third stanza\r\nwas added as a doxology. The hymn was sung at the conclusion of the\r\nPeace of Westphalia which ended the Thirty Years’ War, and has been used\r\nsince on many national occasions of thanksgiving, not only in Germany\r\nbut in England and America as well.\r\n\r\nMartin Rinkart was born in Eilenburg, Saxony, the son of a cooper. After\r\ngraduating from the University of Leipzig, he held appointments as\r\nMaster at the Gymnasium and Cantor of St. Nicholas Church in Eisleben,\r\nthen became, in 1617, Archidiaconus at Eilenburg, a position he held the\r\nrest of his life. Rinkart was poet, dramatist, and musician, as well as\r\npastor. During the Thirty Years’ War, his church at Eilenburg became an\r\nasylum for refugees from all parts. The suffering from famine and\r\npestilence was indescribable. For some time, Rinkart was the only\r\nclergyman in the town, and he frequently conducted as many as forty\r\nfuneral services in one day. A man of sympathy and generosity, he\r\nstrained his own resources in his efforts to keep others from starving.\r\n\r\nThe translation is from Miss Winkworth’s _Lyra Germanica_, 1858.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Catherine Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NUN DANKET was composed by Johann Crüger, 1598-1662. It\r\nappeared in his famous collection, _Praxis Pietatis Melica_, which was\r\nissued in more than fifty editions during the century after its first\r\npublication in 1644. Mendelssohn used the tune in his _Lobgesang_, in\r\nsix-part harmony.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Crüger see Hymn 242.\r\n\r\n\r\n515. Praise to the Lord, the Almighty         _Joachim Neander_, 1650-80\r\n                                      _Tr.

It is “a magnificent\r\nsong of praise, probably the finest there is, when we consider the tune,\r\nand certainly the finest production of Neander’s.”\r\n\r\nNeander was the first prominent writer of hymns in the Reformed Church\r\nof Germany which for a long time used only metrical versions of the\r\nPsalms in public worship. After a brief and stormy ministry, he died at\r\nthe age of thirty.\r\n\r\nFor further comments on Neander see Hymn 505.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Miss Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LOBE DEN HERREN is a tune of great vigor and strength, yet\r\nsimple of structure. It is very usable in a service of praise and\r\nthanksgiving and has been sung with great effect by large chorus choirs.\r\nThe origin of the tune is uncertain. It appeared anonymously in _Ander\r\nTheil des Erneuerten Gesangbuch_, Stralsund, 1665, to the words, “Hast\r\ndu denn, Liebster, dein Angesicht gänzlich verborgen,” by Ahasuerus\r\nFritsch, which suggests a secular origin of the melody. It is believed,\r\nby some authorities, that Neander himself adapted it from an earlier\r\nchorale. The tune appears with many variants of melody and harmonization\r\nin different hymn books. The present form has been used since 1708.\r\n\r\n\r\n516. How great, Almighty, is Thy kindness        _Christian F.

Born\r\nin Saxony, the son of a Lutheran country preacher, he attended\r\nFürstenschule at Meissen, and then went to the University of Leipzig\r\nwhere he studied philosophy and theology. Later he lectured at that\r\nuniversity on poetry, elocution, and moral philosophy. He was beloved by\r\nall his classes, the lectures sometimes being attended by four hundred.\r\nOutside the university he was even more popular. A poor peasant once\r\nunloaded a cart full of wood before Gellert’s house, begging him to\r\naccept the gift as thanks for his beautiful fables. The keynote of his\r\npopularity is expressed in one of his letters:\r\n\r\n  Mein grösster Ehrgeiz besteht darin, dasz ich den Vernünftigen dienen\r\n  und gefallen will, und nicht den Gelehrten im engen Verstande. Ein\r\n  kluges Frauenzimmer gilt mir mehr als eine gelehrte Zeitung, und der\r\n  niedrigste Mann von gesundem Verstande ist mir würdig genug, seine\r\n  Aufmerksamkeit zu suchen, sein Vergnügen zu befördern und ihm in einem\r\n  leicht zu behaltenden Ausdrucke gute Wahrheiten zu sagen und edle\r\n  Empfindungen in seiner Seele rege zu machen.\r\n\r\nGellert’s reputation rests chiefly on his fables and stories. His best\r\nreligious poems are “Wie gross ist des Allmächt’gen Güte,” “Dies ist der\r\nTag, den Gott gemacht,” and “Jesus lebt, mit ihm auch ich” (543).\r\n\r\nNo information is at hand concerning the translator, Margarete\r\nMünsterberg.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WIE GROSS IST DES ALLMÄCHT’GEN GÜTE is ascribed here to C. F.\r\nRichter. The Canadian _Gesangbuch_ credits the tune to J.\r\nFreylinghausen.\r\n\r\nChristian Friedrich Richter, 1676-1711, born at Sorau, in Niederlausitz,\r\nstudied medicine and theology in Halle and became practicing physician\r\nin the Orphanage in Halle. A deeply religious man with poetic insight,\r\nhe wrote 33 hymns, and is the author of a treatise on the Crucifixion of\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\n\r\n517.

Coming to\r\nAmerica, Brueckner served a year as Lutheran Seaman’s Pastor for the\r\nPort of New York. From 1915 to 1931 he was pastor of St. Matthaeus\r\nLutheran Church, Hoboken, N. J., and since that time has served as\r\nProfessor of Church History in Hartwick Seminary. He is the author of a\r\nnumber of volumes on ecclesiastical and historical subjects, among them,\r\n_Church and State in Germany_, published in 1934.\r\n\r\nBrueckner’s translation was slightly altered by the editors of the\r\n_Hymnary_, at two points:\r\n\r\nStanza 1, line 4: “And sign of thy celestial lore,” to “Thy name to\r\nhonor and adore.”\r\n\r\nStanza 2, line 5: “Thy love, so tender, and caressing,” to “Thy love, so\r\ntender, so possessing.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST.

It is based on Psalm 104, one of the great nature Psalms.\r\n\r\nJohann Andreas Cramer was the son of a Lutheran pastor. He was educated\r\nat Leipzig and became famous as a preacher and teacher, later serving as\r\nProfessor of Theology and Chancellor of the University of Kiel in\r\nGermany. He wrote numerous religious lyrics and psalm versions, a number\r\nof which passed into the hymnbooks of his time, and several of which\r\nhave been translated into English.\r\n\r\nThe present hymn is a translation of stanzas 1 and 10 of the German\r\noriginal. No information has been traced concerning Harriett R. Spaeth,\r\nthe translator.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HERR, DIR IST NIEMAND VERGLEICHEN derives its name from the\r\nfirst line of the hymn with which it is associated. The composer, Justin\r\nHeinrich Knecht, 1752-1817, was an eminent German organist and music\r\ndirector of the town of Biberach, Swabia. He edited the _Württemberg\r\nChoralbuch_, an important collection of tunes, to which he contributed\r\n97 of his own compositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n519.

The hymn is popular\r\namong Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Anglicans, as a post-communion\r\nhymn, and is a great favorite among Mennonite churches. It sounds a\r\nuniversal note of praise that can be sung by Christians of all\r\ndenominations. The hymn was used at the opening of the first World\r\nAssembly of Churches, held at Amsterdam, August 22 to September 4, 1948,\r\nwhere it was sung simultaneously in different tongues.\r\n\r\nThe author, Ignaz Franz, was born at Protzan, Kr. Frankenstein, in\r\nSilesia. He first was priest in Schlowa, and then became rector of a\r\ngraduate school for priests in Breslau. In 1772, under the influence of\r\nthe Enlightenment, he published a Catholic hymnbook. He is described as\r\na man filled with zeal for the good things in religion and the church.\r\n\r\nNote: The _Te Deum_ is a long Latin hymn of uncertain origin,\r\nconstituting the supreme expression of rejoicing in the Roman Catholic,\r\nAnglican, and other Christian Churches. It is sometimes called the\r\n“Canticle of Ambrose and Augustine,” from the legend that at the baptism\r\nof Augustine by Ambrose it was sung antiphonally, extempore, by the two\r\nmen. It dates back to the fourth or fifth century. Its contents are\r\ndrawn from different sources: the Apostles’ Creed, the “Gloria in\r\nExcelsis,” and the Psalms (e.g. 28:9, 31:1, 33:22, 123:3, 145:2).\r\nLuther, who translated it into German, praised it as a “fine symbol or\r\nconfession, not only for confessing the right faith but also for\r\npraising and thanking God withal.” A real confession of faith ought to\r\nbe sung, and as such the _Te Deum_ has been on the lips of the Church,\r\nin one form or another, ever since it was composed.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GROSSER GOTT, WIR LOBEN DICH is of unknown composition. The\r\ntune first appeared in the _Katholisches Gesangbuch_, a book undated but\r\nnot earlier than 1774, set to the words, “Grosser Gott.” Its first\r\nappearance in a Protestant hymn book was in Schicht’s _Choral-Buch_,\r\nLeipzig, 1819. It was set to English words in _Melodia Sacra_, Dublin,\r\n1844, to the hymn, “Jesus, and shall it ever be,” where the tune was\r\nmodified to fit the words and named, “Stillorgan.” Later, under the\r\nname, “Hursley”, it became widely associated with Keble’s evening hymn,\r\n“Sun of my Soul” (No. 30). _St. Basil’s Hymnal_ (Roman Catholic, 1918),\r\nas well as the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_, attribute the tune to Peter\r\nRitter; _Glaubensharfe_, to J. Haydn. There seems to be no good evidence\r\nfor either. The English _Church Hymnary_, London, 1935, has set the\r\ntune, naming it “Pascal”, to Toplady’s “Rock of Ages.” In some of the\r\nbooks the last score is marked with a repeat sign for the sake of\r\nemphasis and climax.\r\n\r\n\r\n520. Holy Lord, holy Lord                                    _Anonymous_\r\n\r\nThe notes of thanksgiving and praise are dominant. The origin of the\r\nhymn has not been traced.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FAHRE FORT, attributed erroneously in the _Hymnary_ to Johann\r\nE. Schmidt, is of anonymous origin. It appeared in Freylinghausen’s\r\n_Gesangbuch_, Halle, 1704, with the well-known hymn, “Fahre fort, fahre\r\nfort,” by Johann E. Schmidt, 1669-1745. The tune derived its name from\r\nthis hymn.\r\n\r\n\r\n521. All glory be to God on High       _Nikolaus Decius_, _c._ 1490-1541\r\n                                      _Tr.

(The date,\r\n“1626,” in the _Hymnary_ is obviously wrong.) He was a monk in the Roman\r\nCatholic Church but became a follower of Luther, leaving the cloister at\r\nSteterburg, in 1519, to become a teacher and evangelical preacher. His\r\nwork was carried on under constant opposition from the Church of Rome.\r\nHe died suddenly in 1541 with some suspicion of having been poisoned by\r\nhis enemies. Three hymns are ascribed to Decius: versions of the\r\n_Sanctus_, the _Gloria in excelsis_, and the _Agnus Dei_ (No. 540). The\r\npresent hymn is a translation of the second, the _Gloria in excelsis_.\r\nIt became very popular, though Luther did not use it in any of his\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Catherine Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NUN FREUT EUCH is also attributed to Decius who was a good\r\nmusician as well as a popular preacher. It is often called “Luther’s\r\nHymn” but there is no evidence that he wrote it. The tune appeared in\r\n_Geistliche Lieder_, Wittenberg, 1535, where it was set to Luther’s\r\nhymn, “Nun freut euch, liebe Christengemein.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ADVENT\r\n\r\n\r\n522.

Percy Dearmer\r\nwrites of this choral: “There is no other hymn like this, surely the\r\ngrandest and most thrilling, both in words and music—and both words and\r\nmusic by the same man.” It is based on the parable of the wise and\r\nfoolish virgins in Matt. 25:1-13, and on Rev. 19:6-9 (the marriage of\r\nthe Lamb); 21:22; 1 Cor. 2:9; Ezek. 3:17; and Isa. 52:8.\r\n\r\nNicolai, an ardent Lutheran and influential preacher, was fierce in his\r\ndenunciation of both Calvinism and Roman Catholicism. He held pastorates\r\nin various places. From 1601 until his death, he was chief pastor of St.\r\nKatherine’s, Hamburg. It was during his five years at Unna, Westphalia,\r\nthat a terrible pestilence swept through the community, claiming the\r\nlives of over 1300 people. Nicolai’s parsonage overlooked the church\r\nyard where the burial of the victims was taking place continually. These\r\nscenes of sorrow and death moved him to write this great judgment hymn\r\nwhich he entitled, “Of the Voice at Midnight, and the Wise Virgins who\r\nmeet their Heavenly Bridegroom.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on Miss Winkworth, translator, see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WACHET AUF, one of the greatest and most solemn melodies of\r\nevangelical Christendom, was composed by Nicolai. The present setting is\r\nby Michael Praetorius, 1571-1621, a writer on the theory of music and a\r\ncomposer of note. The melody was used by Bach in one of his cantatas and\r\nMendelssohn used it in his _St. Paul_. Handel used the seventh and\r\neighth lines of the melody with great effect in the “Hallelujah Chorus,”\r\nwith the phrase, “The kingdom of this world.”\r\n\r\n\r\n523.

It was written\r\nfor use on the first Sunday in Advent.\r\n\r\nGeorg Weissel was born at Domnau, Prussia. He was a student of theology,\r\na teacher, and, from 1623, until his death in 1635, the pastor of\r\nRoszgärt’schen Church in Königsberg. He is the author of twenty hymns,\r\nthis being probably the best and most widely used. Our version is a\r\ntranslation of stanzas 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the original.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Catherine Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MACHT HOCH DIE TÜR is one of several chorale tunes, probably\r\nthe most popular, to which this hymn is set.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Johann Freylinghausen, 1670-1739, was born at Gandersheim,\r\nthe son of the town’s burgomaster. He was educated at Jena. After the\r\ndeath of his father-in-law, August Francke, Pietist leader, he became\r\nthe latter’s successor as director of the Paedagogium and the Orphanage\r\nin Halle and pastor in full charge of St. Ulrich’s. Freylinghausen was a\r\nmusician and wrote some 22 church melodies but his outstanding work\r\nconsists of his two collections of hymns: _Geistreiches Gesangbuch,_\r\n1704, and _Neues Geistreiches Gesangbuch,_ 1714. The former contains 683\r\nhymns and 173 melodies, and the latter, 815 hymns and 154 melodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n524. O Son of God, we wait for Thee       _Philipp F.

Seiss,_ 1823-1904\r\n\r\n                                   1.\r\n  Wir warten dein, O Gottes Sohn,\r\n    Und lieben dein Erscheinen;\r\n  Wir wissen dich auf deinem Thron,\r\n    Und nennen uns die deinen.\r\n      Wer an dich glaubt\r\n      Erhebt sein Haupt,\r\n  Und siehet dir entgegen,\r\n  Du kommst uns ja zum Segen.\r\n\r\n                                   2.\r\n  Wir warten deiner mit Geduld\r\n    In unsern Leidenstagen;\r\n  Wir trösten uns, dass du die Schuld\r\n    Für uns am Kreuz getragen.\r\n      So können wir\r\n      Nun gern mit dir\r\n  Uns auch zum Kreuz bequemen,\r\n  Bis du’s hinweg wirst nehmen.\r\n\r\n                                   3.\r\n  Wir warten dein; du hast uns ja\r\n    Das Herz schon hingenommen.\r\n  Du bist zwar unserm Geiste nah,\r\n    Doch wirst du sichtbar kommen;\r\n      Da willst uns du\r\n      Bei dir auch Ruh’,\r\n  Bei dir auch Freude geben,\r\n  Bei dir ein herrlich Leben.\r\n\r\n                                   4.\r\n  Wir warten dein, du kommst gewiss,\r\n    Die Zeit ist bald vergangen;\r\n  Wir freuen uns schon über dies\r\n    Mit kindlichem Verlangen.\r\n      Was wird geschehn,\r\n      Wenn wir dich sehn,\r\n  Wenn du uns heim wirst bringen,\r\n  Wenn wir dir ewig singen!\r\n\r\nIn clear and concise language, the hymn voices the hope for the coming\r\nof Christ.\r\n\r\nPhillipp Friedrich Hiller, son of a Lutheran Pastor, was born at\r\nMühlhausen, Württemberg. To escape the French invaders, he fled with his\r\nparents, at the age of 8, to Heidenheim. In 1713, he went to the\r\nKlosterschule, Denkendorf, where Bengel had a decided influence upon\r\nhim. In 1748, he became the pastor in Steinheim, where, after three\r\nyears of faithful service, a throat disease afflicted him, resulting in\r\nthe loss of his voice. No longer able to preach, he gave himself to\r\nBible study and writing, composing more than 100 hymns, and publishing a\r\nvolume of religious poetry, _Geistliches Liederkästlein_.\r\n\r\nThe translation is by Joseph Augustus Seiss, a Lutheran minister, born\r\nat Graceham, Md., and educated at Gettysburg College and Seminary. Seiss\r\nwas a noted pulpit orator in his denomination and held pastorates in\r\nVirginia, Maryland, and, finally, in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GASTORIUS is ascribed by some authorities to Johann Pachelbel\r\nof Nürnberg, a contemporary of Gastorius. The melody appeared in the\r\n_Auserlesenes Weimarisches Gesangbuch_, 1681. Zahn, on the basis of\r\ncareful study of the sources, does not hesitate to credit its\r\ncomposition to Gastorius, about 1675. It was originally set to a hymn by\r\nSamuel Rodigast, “Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan.”\r\n\r\nSeverus Gastorius, cantor in Jena, was born about 1650.

The present hymn is a selection of\r\nstanzas 1, 7 and 8, from Catherine Winkworth’s translation. The original\r\n15 stanzas are printed here in full for the benefit of those who may\r\nwish to read the whole hymn and study its structure.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Paul Gerhardt see Hymn 134.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Miss Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WARUM SOLLT ICH MICH DENN GRÄMEN, also called, “Ebeling,” and\r\n“Bonn,” soon superseded Crüger’s tune. It was originally set to another\r\nof Gerhardt’s hymns, “Warum sollt ich mich denn grämen,” from whence the\r\ntune derives its name. The composer, Johann Georg Ebeling, 1620-76, was\r\ncantor of St. Nicholas Cathedral, Berlin, and director of music at the\r\nGrayfriars Gymnasium there, succeeding Johann Crüger to these positions,\r\nin 1662. Six years later, he became Professor of Music at the Carolinen\r\nGymnasium, Stettin.\r\n\r\nThe harmonization is by W. H. Hohmann, Professor of Music, Bethel\r\nCollege, and co-editor of the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n526.

Neale_, 1818-66\r\n\r\nThis is one of a half dozen or more hymns in our book that have come\r\ndown from the ancient Eastern or Greek Church. (Other hymns from this\r\nperiod are Nos. 34, 113, 115, 143, and 398.)\r\n\r\nSt. Germanus was born and died in Constantinople. He lived to be a\r\nhundred years old. He became an influential leader in the church, and\r\nserved, for a time, as Patriarch, or Bishop of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nFor this translation, we are indebted to John M. Neale, English\r\nhymnologist and classical scholar. Neale possessed extraordinary\r\nlinguistic skill and did more than anyone else to make available to\r\nEnglish speaking people some of the rich treasure of Greek and Latin\r\nhymnody.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ES IST EIN’ ROS’ ENTSPRUNGEN, also known as “Rosa Mystica,” is\r\na traditional German melody, originally set to a well-known carol\r\nbeginning with the stanza:\r\n\r\n  Es ist ein Reis entsprungen\r\n    Aus einer Wurzel zart,\r\n  Als uns die Alten sungen,\r\n    Von Jesse kam die Art,\r\n  Und hat ein Blümlein bracht\r\n    Mitten im kalten Winter\r\n  Wohl zu der halben Nacht.\r\n\r\nIt is an attractive and interesting tune, of irregular rhythm. The\r\npresent setting was made by Michael Praetorius, 1517-1621, German\r\ncomposer and Kapellmeister.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Praetorius see Hymn 248.\r\n\r\n\r\n527.

Luther’s instructions were that the\r\nfirst seven verses were to be sung by a man dressed as an angel,\r\nwhereupon the children would greet him with the singing of verses eight\r\nto fifteen. The present hymn is a selection of stanzas 1, 2, 3, 8, 13,\r\nand 15.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, Miss Winkworth, see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ VOM HIMMEL HOCH, also by Luther, was early associated with the\r\nwords of the carol and has become one of the best known chorales. J. S.\r\nBach made several settings of the tune, one of them in his _Christmas\r\nOratorio_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NEW YEAR\r\n\r\n\r\n528. For Thy mercy and Thy grace                   _H. Downton_, 1818-85\r\n\r\nOriginally in seven stanzas, this hymn was first published, 1843, in the\r\n_Church of England Magazine_, under the title, “A Hymn for the\r\nCommencement of the Year.” It is a first-rate quality hymn for the New\r\nYear.\r\n\r\nThe author, Henry Downton, was born in Pulverbatch, Shropshire, England.\r\nIn 1840, he graduated from Cambridge where his father was sub-librarian\r\nof Trinity College. After serving as curate of St. John’s Chatham,\r\nDownton became English chaplain at Geneva in 1857, returning to England\r\nin 1873 to become rector of Hopton, Suffolk. In Geneva, he had become\r\nacquainted with the hymnody of the Swiss and French Churches, and\r\ntranslated a number of their hymns into English. He published _Hymns and\r\nVerses, Original and Translated_, 1873.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CULBACH appeared in _Heilige Seelenlust_, Breslau, 1657, set to\r\nthe hymn, “Ach wann kommt die Zeit heran.” The melody, simple in\r\nstructure and well within the pitch range of all voices, is admirably\r\nadapted to congregational singing, in unison or in parts.

Amen!\r\n  Komm, du schöne Freudenkrone,\r\n  Bleib nicht lange,\r\n  Deiner wart’ ich mit Verlangen!\r\n\r\nKnown as the “Queen of the Chorales.” The words and music were written\r\nin 1527 by the Lutheran pastor, Philipp Nicolai, during the same\r\npestilence that inspired “Wachet auf,” the “King of Chorales” (No. 522).\r\nNicolai, in deep meditation concerning the suffering around him, started\r\nwriting the hymn one morning, and forgetting his noonday meal, worked on\r\ntill he had finished it in the late afternoon. It was first published in\r\nthe author’s _Freuden-Spiegel_, Frankfurt, 1599, under the title, “A\r\nSpiritual bridal song of the believing soul, concerning her Heavenly\r\nBridegroom, founded in the 45th Psalm of the prophet David.” Catherine\r\nWinkworth wrote of the chorale:\r\n\r\n  So popular did it soon become, that its tune was often chimed by city\r\n  chimes, lines and verses from it were printed by way of ornament on\r\n  the common earthenware of the country, and it was invariably used at\r\n  weddings and certain festivals.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Miss Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NICOLAI is usually known by the first line of the words for\r\nwhich it was written, “Wie shön leuchtet der Morgenstern.” It is a\r\nmagnificent chorale tune. Mendelssohn used the tune in his _Christus_,\r\nand Bach made a harmonization of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n530.

It is considered by many to be Luther’s\r\nbest production and Julian ranks it with the finest German psalm\r\nversions. The hymn was first published in Luther’s _Etlich Cristlich\r\nLider_, Wittenberg, 1524, and in his _Eyn Enchiridion_, Erfurt, 1524, in\r\nfour stanzas. It was then rewritten and expanded into five stanzas and\r\nin this form published in Johann Walther’s _Geystliche Gesangk\r\nBuchleyn_, Wittenberg, 1524, and again in Luther’s later work,\r\n_Christliche Geseng zum Begrebnis_, Wittenberg, 1542. It is appropriate\r\nfor use at a Christian burial, as well as other occasions, and was sung\r\nat Halle, in 1546, while Luther’s body was being brought from Eisleben\r\nto Wittenberg for burial.\r\n\r\nThe “depths” from which the psalmist cries to God for deliverance, are\r\nnot so much physical and psychical as moral and spiritual. The writer is\r\nconscious of his sinfulness, as well as the sinfulness of his people and\r\nsees that there is no help except through penitence and acceptance of\r\nthe mercy and forgiveness of God.\r\n\r\nThe first three stanzas from Catherine Winkworth’s translation were\r\nselected for use here.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Miss Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ AUS TIEFER NOT, also called “De Profundis,” and “Luther’s\r\n130th,” is attributed to Luther himself. J. S. Bach’s cantata, _Aus\r\ntiefer Not schrei’ ich zu Dir_, is built on this tune. Luther believed\r\nin the power of music to drive away the Evil One and frequently, when\r\nanxious about the fate of his cause, he would say to his companions,\r\n“Come, let us confound the devil and all his followers, by singing\r\ntogether the psalm, ‘Aus tiefer Not.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n532.

The tune is credited to J. M.\r\nBiermann, an American writer of tunes of the gospel hymn type. He was\r\nmusical editor of _Hosianna_, Cleveland, 1876, published by the\r\nEvangelical Church. The composer seems to have borrowed from the tune\r\n“Macht Hoch die Tür,” No. 523. _Hosianna_ contains about 35 of his tunes\r\nand arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n533.

The hymn is based on\r\nJohn 1:29: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the\r\nworld”; and Isa. 53:7: “He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he\r\nopened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a\r\nsheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.” It was\r\npublished in the third edition of Johann Crüger’s _Praxis Pietatis\r\nMelica_, in 1648.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Paul Gerhardt see Hymn 134.\r\n\r\nOur hymn consists of stanzas 5 and 6, translated by J. Gambold.\r\nBiographical data concerning Gambold has not been found.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EIN LAMM GEHT HIN, also called “An Wasserflüssen Babylon,”\r\nfirst appeared in the third part of the Strassburg _Kirchenampt_, 1525,\r\nwhere it is set to Wolfgang Dachstein’s hymn on Psalm 137, beginning\r\nwith the stanza:\r\n\r\n  An Wasserflüssen Babylon,\r\n    Da sassen wir mit Schmerzen;\r\n  Als wir gedachten an Zion,\r\n    Da weinten wir von Herzen.\r\n  Wir hingen auf mit schwerem Mut\r\n  Die Orgeln und die Harfen gut\r\n    An ihren Bäum’ und Weiden,\r\n  Die drinnen sind in ihrem Land,\r\n  Da mussten wir viel Schmach und Schand’\r\n    Täglich von ihnen leiden.\r\n\r\nThe tune appeared anonymously but may have been composed, as some\r\nauthorities believe, by Dachstein himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n534.

On\r\naccount of ill health, he retired and devoted himself to literary work.\r\nThis hymn, written during the miseries of the Thirty Years’ War, was\r\ncomposed for Passiontide and was entitled, “The Cause of the Bitter\r\nSufferings of Jesus Christ and Consolations from His Love and Grace.”\r\nThe author experienced much suffering himself. First came the death of\r\nhis wife in 1617, then the failure of his own health, and then the war.\r\nHis hymns are characterized by tenderness and depth of feeling, and\r\nillustrate the truth that real poets “learn in suffering what they teach\r\nin song.”\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, Robert Bridges, see Hymn 32. His first\r\ntwo stanzas are translations of 1 and 2 of the original; while stanzas 3\r\nand 4 contain suggestions, only, of 6 and 7 and the rest of Heermann’s\r\npoem.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ HERZLIEBSTER JESU is a grandly impressive tune, composed by the\r\ndistinguished musician and writer of chorales, Johann Crüger, 1598-1662.\r\nIt has been observed that nearly five-sevenths of this whole melody has\r\na downward movement, which accounts for some of its intensely solemn\r\ncharacter. J. S. Bach used the tune in his _St. Matthew’s Passion_.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Johann Crüger, see Hymn 242.\r\n\r\n\r\n535. Christ, the Life of all the living      _Ernst C.

It was first published in his\r\n_Geistliche Lieder_, _Jena_, 1659, for Passiontide, entitled, “Hymn of\r\nThanksgiving for his Redeemer and Saviour for His bitter sufferings.”\r\n\r\nErnst Christoph Homburg, born near Eisenach, was a lawyer by profession,\r\nand a poet of high rank. His life was not without its cup of bitterness.\r\nDomestic troubles, arising from the illness of himself and of his wife,\r\nand other difficulties, bore heavily upon him and he was led, as a\r\nresult, to turn to God and place all his confidence in Him. In the\r\npreface to one of his hymn collections, he wrote: “I was especially\r\ninduced and compelled to their composition by the anxious and sore\r\ndomestic afflictions by which God ... has for some time laid me aside.”\r\nHe is the author of 148 hymns.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Miss Winkworth see Hymn 236.

Here he spent many years in further study and thinking out\r\nhis preaching message. Living in a time when the moral tone of\r\nChristianity was at a very low ebb, Savonarola preached boldly and\r\neloquently against the sins of a corrupt world and a corrupt church. His\r\nrelentless denunciation of the pope and priests resulted in his\r\nexcommunication by Pope Alexander VI, and on May 23, 1498, he was\r\npublicly executed on one of the streets of Florence. His death as a\r\nmartyr proved to Luther, across the Alps, that it is “hopeless to hope\r\nin the purification of Rome,” and gave to the reformation movement a\r\npowerful impulse.\r\n\r\nThe translation of the hymn is by Jane Elgee, daughter of Archdeacon\r\nElgee, of Ireland. In 1851 she married Sir William Wilde, an oculist\r\nliving in Dublin.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ O DU LIEBE MEINER LIEBE comes from Johann Thommen’s\r\n_Erbaulicher Musikalischer Christenschatz_, Basel, 1745, where it is set\r\nto the hymn, “O du Liebe meiner Leibe,” by Johann Scheffler (See 565).\r\nThe tune is also called, “Cassel,” and “Lucerne.” Like numerous other\r\nchorale tunes, it was originally a folk tune, and had been in use by the\r\nMoravian Brethren at Herrnhut. It is one of the well-known tunes in the\r\n_Gesangbuch mit Noten_, deserving of its popularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n537.

(See\r\nHymn 574.) Born at Herrnhut, and educated by his parents, he became his\r\nfather’s assistant in 1744, continuing until 1749. Illness overtook him\r\nand he spent the last years of his life, an invalid, in London where he\r\ndied at the age of 25. Zinzendorf was a young man of maturity and deep\r\nChristian convictions, and composed a number of hymns. The present hymn,\r\nprobably his best production, was first published in the appendix of the\r\n_London Hymn Book_, 1755.\r\n\r\nThe translation is by J. C.

In\r\n1933 he was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.\r\nHe is the author of numerous books and served on the Committee for the\r\nRevision of the _Church Hymnary_, Edinburgh, 1927.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NICHT SO TRAURIG, also called “Pressburg,” is from\r\nFreylinghausen’s _Neues Geistreiches Gesangbuch_, 1714, where it is set\r\nto Gerhardt’s hymn, “Nicht so traurig, nicht so sehr.” The melody has\r\nbeen simplified somewhat from the original to fit the English words. It\r\nwas included in the _Hymnary_ for choir use during the season of Lent.\r\n\r\n\r\n539.

The work is attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux, preacher of the\r\nSecond Crusade, and one of the most brilliant of Latin hymn writers.\r\nLuther wrote of him: “If there has ever been a pious monk who feared God\r\nit was St. Bernard, whom alone I hold in much higher esteem than all\r\nother monks and priests throughout the globe.” Bernard founded a\r\nmonastery in Wormwood, a robber-infested valley in France. He changed\r\nthe name to “Clara Vallis,” (Beautiful Valley), from which is derived\r\nthe designation “Clairvaux.”\r\n\r\nThough composed in the twelfth century, the hymn did not achieve fame\r\nuntil five centuries later when it was translated into German by Paul\r\nGerhardt, who, next to Luther, was the greatest of all German hymn\r\nwriters. His translation, a free paraphrase, appeared in Crüger’s\r\n_Praxis_, 1656, and is considered by Philip Schaff to be “fully equal to\r\nthe original.”\r\n\r\nFor comment on Gerhardt see Hymn 134.\r\n\r\nThe translation into English was made in 1849 by James W. Alexander of\r\nPrinceton, a Presbyterian. Schaff wrote that “Dr. Alexander is beyond\r\ndoubt one of the best translators of German hymns into idiomatic\r\nEnglish.” He also wrote concerning this hymn that it has “shown an\r\nimperishable vitality in passing from the Latin into the German and from\r\nthe German into the English, and proclaiming in three tongues and in the\r\nname of three confessions—the Catholic, the Lutheran, and the\r\nReformed—with equal effect, the dying love of our Savior, and our\r\nboundless indebtedness to Him.”\r\n\r\nOur hymn is a selection of stanzas 1, 4, 8, and 10. In the first stanza,\r\nthe line, “I marvel at the story,” is substituted for Alexander’s\r\noriginal which read, “Yet though despised and gory.” Stanza 10 has been\r\nfrequently used as a prayer for the dying.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ PASSION CHORALE was originally set to a love song entitled,\r\n“Mein G’müt ist mir verwirret.” The tune was composed by the\r\ndistinguished organist, Hans Leo Hassler, and first appeared in his\r\n_Lustgarten Neuer Teutscher Gesäng_, 1601. In 1613 it appeared in\r\n_Harmoniæ Sacræ_, set to the hymn, “Herzlich thut mich verlangen,” and\r\nlater it became associated with “O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden.” It was a\r\nfavorite melody with Bach, who used it five times in his _St. Matthew\r\nPassion_.\r\n\r\nHans Leo Hassler, 1564-1612, was born at Nürnberg and died at Frankfurt\r\nat the age of 47. He was a member of a distinguished musical family.\r\nAfter an early career as organist, he was sent to Venice to study under\r\nAndrea Gabriele, organist of St. Mark’s, becoming the earliest of\r\nimportant German composers to receive an Italian training. Returning to\r\nGermany, Hassler held positions in Augsburg, Nürnberg, and elsewhere.\r\nHis numerous compositions for voice and organ are of such a standard as\r\nto give him a high place in German music, and most of them have been\r\nreprinted in modern times.\r\n\r\nJ. S. Bach, 1685-1750, who arranged the tune, is by far the greatest\r\nmusician the Protestant Church has produced. Most of his life was spent\r\nin Leipzig where he labored from 1723 until his death in 1750, as cantor\r\nof the Thomas School and director of music at the Thomas and Nicolai\r\nchurches. His genius as a master of the organ and composer of chorales\r\nand passion music has never been equaled. Though he lived in an age when\r\nopera flourished in Europe, he paid no attention to it, devoting all his\r\ntalent to church music. There is something in his music that touches the\r\ndeepest chords of religious emotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n540. Lamb of God most holy    _Nikolaus von Hofe_ (_Decius_), 1490?-1541\r\n\r\n  O Lamm Gottes, unschuldig\r\n    Am Stamm des Kreuzes geschlachtet,\r\n  Allzeit funden geduldig,\r\n    Wiewohl du warest verachtet:\r\n  All’ Sünd’ hast du getragen,\r\n  Sonst müssten wir verzagen.\r\n    Erbarm dich unser, O Jesu!\r\n\r\n  O Lamm Gottes, unschuldig\r\n    Am Stamm des Kreuzes geschlachtet,\r\n  Allzeit funden geduldig,\r\n    Wiewohl du warest verachtet:\r\n  All’ Sünd’ hast du getragen,\r\n  Sonst müssten wir verzagen.\r\n    Erbarm dich unser, O Jesu!\r\n\r\n  O Lamm Gottes, unschuldig\r\n    Am Stamm des Kreuzes geschlachtet,\r\n  Allzeit funden geduldig,\r\n    Wiewohl du warest verachtet:\r\n  All’ Sünd’ hast du getragen,\r\n  Sonst müssten wir verzagen.\r\n    Gib uns dein’n Frieden, o Jesu!\r\n\r\nBased on John 1:29: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin\r\nof the world.” The hymn, called the _Agnus Dei_ in liturgical\r\nliterature, is a prayer for God’s mercy and peace, and a confession that\r\nChrist alone is able to take away the sin of the world. It is an ancient\r\nsong which has been in use in the church since 701 A.D. and originally\r\nwas chanted antiphonally by clergy and laity. Since the 12th century the\r\ncustom has been to repeat the chant three times. In some churches it is\r\nalways sung just before the communion of the Lord’s Supper.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Decius see Hymn 521.\r\n\r\nThe translation is composite.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ O LAMM GOTTES, UNSCHULDIG is based on an ancient Gregorian\r\nsetting for the _Agnus Dei_ and may have been arranged by Decius\r\nhimself, for he was a musician as well as a preacher. The word\r\n“Gregorian” stems from Gregory the Great, who was Pope from 590 to 604\r\nA.D. He was distinguished for his public service and his contribution to\r\nchurch music, developing the use of the plain chant (also called “plain\r\nsong” and “Gregorian chant”) which is identified with his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EASTERTIDE\r\n\r\n\r\n541.

She was married to\r\nElector Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg. Interested in the economic as\r\nwell as religious welfare of her people, she founded model farms,\r\nintroduced the culture of the Irish potato, and was helpful in many ways\r\nin the restoration of the country after the ravages of the Thirty Years\r\nWar. Luise Henriette is credited with numerous hymns but Julian points\r\nout that there is uncertainty whether she actually wrote all of them or\r\nselected them as her favorites. She had a great admiration for Paul\r\nGerhardt and his poetry.\r\n\r\nThe hymn is a selection of stanzas 1, 2, 3, and 10.

The hymn is often\r\nused at funerals, and sometimes at the dedication of a cemetery.\r\nGellert, a saintly Professor of Philosophy and Poetry at Leipzig, had no\r\nfear of death. In the period of the so-called Enlightenment, when\r\nreligion had become cold and rationalistic, and the old hymns had been\r\nwatered down, he wrote one of our best and most evangelical hymns.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, Frances E. Cox, see Hymn 512.\r\n\r\nThe original poem was without the “Hallelujah.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ CHRIST IST ERSTANDEN is a traditional German melody dating to\r\nthe 13th century. It was used with words beginning, “Christ ist\r\nerstanden.” Luther said of this tune: “after a time one tires of singing\r\nall other hymns, but the ‘Christ ist erstanden’ one can always sing\r\nagain.” It is within easy range of all voices and therefore well adapted\r\nfor unison singing, though it need not be limited to that.\r\n\r\n\r\n544.

Influenced by the writings of\r\nLuther, he left the monastery to join the Bohemian Brethren, the\r\nfollowers of John Hus, and became their pastor at Landskron and Fulneck,\r\nMoravia. Weisse was a man of great influence among the Brethren and was\r\nappointed a member of their council. Of a deeply spiritual nature and\r\npossessing rare poetic gifts, he translated the old songs of the\r\nBohemian Brethren into German and composed many original poems. He\r\nedited the first Brethren hymnbook in German, _Ein Neu Gesengbuchlen_,\r\n1531, in which the present hymn first appeared. The book, proclaimed by\r\nLuther as “the work of a good poet,” contains 155 hymns, all apparently\r\neither translations or originals by Weisse himself.\r\n\r\nOur translation is by Catherine Winkworth, with stanza 4 omitted.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Miss Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MACHE DICH, MEIN GEIST, BEREIT is an adaptation of a chorale\r\ntune, “Straf mich nicht,” published in _Kirch- und Hausbuch_, Dresden,\r\n1694. The composer is not known. Refrains are not commonly used with\r\nGerman chorales. The present setting of the tune and words, with a\r\nrefrain, was made by the editors especially for the _Hymnary_. It is\r\nsuitable for children’s choirs as well as for congregational use.\r\n\r\n\r\n545. Lo, the day of days is here        _Frederick L. Hosmer_, 1840-1929\r\n\r\nA joyous Easter song in which the springtime awakening in nature\r\nsymbolizes the newness of spiritual life.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Frederick L. Hosmer see Hymn 72.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SALZBURG appeared in the 19th edition of Crüger’s _Praxis\r\nPietatis Melica_, 1678, a work which contained the main stream of\r\nLutheran hymnody in the middle of the 17th century. The tune was set to\r\nthe hymn, “Alle Menschen müssen sterben.”\r\n\r\nThe composer, Jacob Hintze, 1622-1702, was born in Bernau, Brandenburg.\r\nHe became court musician to the Elector of Brandenburg, in Berlin, in\r\n1666, and in the year 1662 succeeded Crüger, upon the latter’s death, as\r\neditor of the _Praxis_. The present version, slightly altered from the\r\noriginal, is from J. S. Bach’s _Choralgesänge_. The tune is also\r\nassociated with Stopford Brooke’s hymn, “Let the whole creation cry.”\r\n(No. 49).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              WHITSUNTIDE\r\n\r\n\r\n546.

It is a beautiful New Testament paraphrase of Isa.\r\n11:2:\r\n\r\n  And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom\r\n  and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of\r\n  knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.\r\n\r\nMichael Schirmer, born in Leipzig, received his education at the\r\nUniversity of Leipzig, graduating with an M.A. degree in 1630. He was\r\nappointed assistant rector of the Greyfriars Gymnasium in Berlin, but on\r\naccount of ill health was compelled to resign. Besides the hardships of\r\nthe Thirty Years’ War, Schirmer experienced added sorrows in the death\r\nof his wife and two children. At times deep melancholy fell upon him,\r\nlasting for years at a time. Schirmer was crowned court poet in 1637.\r\nHis published works include a metrical version of _Ecclesiasticus_,\r\n1655; a scriptural play, _Der verfolgte David_, 1660; and versions of\r\nthe Songs of the Old and New Testaments, _Biblische Lieder und\r\nLehrsprüche_, 1650. Five of his hymns came into wide use in Germany but\r\nonly this one passed into English.\r\n\r\nThe translation is by Catherine Winkworth in her _Chorale Book for\r\nEngland_, 1863. The present hymn is composed of stanzas 1, 4, 6, and 8.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Miss Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ NICOLAI, better known as “Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern,”\r\nhas long been known as the “Queen of Chorales.” (For the “King of\r\nChorales,” see Hymn 522.)

Some of the\r\nhymns in this collection are original with Niedling, and bear his name.\r\nThis hymn, however, appears anonymously, leaving doubt as to its\r\nauthorship. The _Common Service Book_ of the United Lutheran Church\r\ncredits it to Niedling.\r\n\r\nThe English translation was made especially for the _United Lutheran\r\nHymnal_, in 1913, employing the first four stanzas of the original.\r\n\r\nThe translator, John Casper Mattes, was born in Easton, Pa. After\r\ngraduating from Lafayette College and Mt. Airy Theological Seminary, he\r\nserved as pastor of the Church of the Saviour, Trenton, N. J., 1901-15,\r\nand St. John Lutheran Church, Scranton, Pa., 1915-38. From 1939 until\r\nhis death in 1948 he was a teacher at the Wartburg Theological Seminary,\r\nDubuque, Iowa. Mattes was a frequent contributor to Lutheran\r\npublications and served on the United Lutheran Church Common Service\r\nBook Committee. He was a member of the Intersynodical Committee on\r\ntranslation of Luther’s _Small Catechism_, and is translator of\r\nKoberle’s _Rechtfertigung und Heiligung_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ O HEILIGER GEIST, O HEILIGER GOTT, also called “O Jesulein\r\nSüss,” first appears in _Auserlesene Catholische Geistliche\r\nKirchengesäng_, Cologne, 1623, set to the hymn, “Ist das der Leib, Herr\r\nJesu Christ.” In _Christliche Seelenharfe_, Halle, 1650, it is set to\r\n“Komm heiliger Geist, mit deinen Genad” while in S. Scheldt’s _Tabulatur\r\nBuch_, Görlitz, 1650, it is used with the hymn, “O Jesulein süss, O\r\nJesulein mild.” The melody appears in many later collections, both\r\nCatholic and Protestant. Its present form, a variant of Scheldt’s,\r\nappeared in the _Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch_, Leipzig, 1682, set to the\r\nhymn, “O heiliger Geist, O heiliger Gott.” It is an attractive tune in\r\ntriple time, of the type associated with early German carols.\r\n\r\nSamuel Scheidt, 1587-1654, the composer, was born at Halle, the son of\r\nConrad Scheidt, overseer of the salt works. He had for his teacher the\r\nfamous Peter Sweelinck of Amsterdam, and became a noted organist and\r\ncomposer. His _Tabulatura Nova_, 1624, set a new standard in organ\r\nplaying, by showing how to make it less ostentatious and more meaningful\r\nand coherent. His great work, _Tablaturbuch_, is a series of harmonized\r\nchorales, published in three parts, 1624-53.\r\n\r\n\r\n548.

After receiving his education at the Universities of\r\nKönigsberg, Frankfurt a. Oder, and Leyden, he practiced law in his home\r\ntown of Guhrau where he lived all his life. He became one of the best\r\nSilesian poets and hymn writers, probably because he was taught in the\r\nschool of affliction and suffering, brought about by the Thirty Years’\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nThe translation is by Charles W. Schaeffer, a native of Hagerstown,\r\nMaryland. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and the\r\nTheological Seminary at Gettysburg, he held several pastorates and then\r\nbecame a teacher in the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia.\r\nOur hymn is a selection of stanzas 1, 2, 7, and 8.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EISENACH, also known as “St. Leonard,” and “Komm, O komm, du\r\nGeist des Lebens,” is an attractive melody, composed by Johann Christoph\r\nBach, 1642-1703, an excellent musician, and a first cousin of the father\r\nof the eminent Johann Sebastian Bach. He was organist at Eisenach where\r\nhe spent most of his life. The name of the tune is derived from Bach’s\r\ntown. Much of the music he composed is extant, mostly in manuscript, but\r\nsome keyboard and choral music is in print. His motet, _I wrestle and\r\npray_, was published by Novello.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\n549.

It has been translated into\r\nnearly two hundred languages. “Ein feste Burg” was sung over Luther’s\r\ngrave at Wittenberg in the Schloss-Kirche, on the door of which some 30\r\nyears before, he had nailed his 95 theses against Roman Indulgences. The\r\nhymn has been used at many historic occasions and conventions. In 1925,\r\nat the meeting of Christians from all parts of the world in Stockholm,\r\nthe opening hymn was “Ein’ feste Burg ist unser Gott.” Each delegate\r\nsang in his own tongue, but it was the same tune, the same hymn and the\r\nsame spirit; and the great conference, assembled to consider the life\r\nand mission of the church, adopted the hymn as an ecumenical symbol. It\r\nwas adopted as the Conference hymn for the fourth Mennonite World\r\nConference held at Goshen, Ind., and North Newton, Kan., August 3-10,\r\n1948.\r\n\r\nThe hymn arose out of the writer’s conflict with the evil forces of the\r\nworld and the corrupt hierarchy of a corrupt church. When Luther was\r\nsummoned to the Diet of Worms, he was warned by his friends not to go.\r\nHe ignored their advice, and, standing before that assemblage of\r\nemperors and principalities and powers, he spoke these memorable words:\r\n\r\n  It is neither safe nor prudent to do aught against conscience. Till\r\n  such time as either by proof from holy Scripture or by fair reason or\r\n  argument I have been confuted and convicted, I cannot and will not\r\n  recant. Here I stand. I cannot do otherwise. God be my help. Amen.\r\n\r\nIt is against this background of opposition and trouble that the great\r\nhymn was penned.\r\n\r\nThere are more than sixty versions of the hymn in the English language.\r\nThe translation used here is by Frederick H. Hedge, then Professor of\r\nEcclesiastical History, and later of German Literature, at Harvard. It\r\nis the commonly accepted version in America. In England, the translation\r\nby Thomas Carlysle is the most widely used.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary occasions the use of the first two stanzas is sufficient.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ EIN’ FESTE BURG IST UNSER GOTT, also by Luther, is one of the\r\ngreat chorales destined to be sung to the end of time. It is perfectly\r\nadapted to the words and especially effective with large congregations.\r\nThe musical merits of the tune have been recognized by the great\r\nmasters. Mendelssohn used the tune in the last movement of his\r\n_Reformation Symphony_ and Bach used it in several of his cantatas.\r\n\r\nAlbert Schweitzer writes of this melody:\r\n\r\n  “Ein feste Burg” is woven out of Gregorian reminiscences. The\r\n  recognition of this fact deprives the melody of none of its beauty and\r\n  Luther of none of the credit for it. It really takes considerable\r\n  talent to create an organic unity out of fragments.\r\n\r\n\r\n550.

The students wanted a good missionary\r\npoem to use with the present tune, then erroneously ascribed to J.\r\nMichael Haydn. Preiswerk supplied the first two stanzas. They were first\r\nsung June 17, 1829, at an anniversary festival. The third stanza was\r\nadded by Count Felician von Zaremba, since it was felt that the first\r\ntwo did not have enough emphasis on foreign missions.\r\n\r\nThe hymn was sung at the laying of the cornerstone of Bethel College and\r\nagain at the sixtieth anniversary of that event, celebrated October 12,\r\n1948.\r\n\r\nSamuel Preiswerk was born in Rümlingen, Switzerland, the son of the\r\npastor of the Reformed Church at that place. He was educated at the\r\nUniversities of Basel, Tübingen, and Erlangen. After serving in a curacy\r\nat Benken and on the staff of the Basel Orphanage, he taught Hebrew at\r\nthe Basel Mission House, later accepting a pastorate at Muttenz, and a\r\nprofessorship at the Ecole de Théologie in Geneva. In 1840 he was called\r\nto the St. Leonhardt Church in Basel, where he became the main pastor in\r\n1843. Finally he was made Antistes or Superintendent of the Reformed\r\nChurches in the Basel Area. Preiswerk was one of the editors of the\r\n_Baseler Gesangbuch_ of 1854 and was otherwise active as a hymnologist.\r\n\r\nFelician von Zaremba, author of the third stanza, was born at Zaroy,\r\nPoland, and died in Basel. A descendant of an old Polish noble family,\r\nhe received a good education at the University of Dorpat, excelling in\r\nlanguages. Although he prepared himself for the diplomatic service to\r\nRussia, he became greatly interested in the missionary work centering in\r\nBasel, and eventually entered the work carried on among the Mohammedans\r\nand Nestorians in South Russia and the Caucasus regions. For many years\r\nhe was an itinerant preacher in Germany and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe translator, Julius Henry Horstmann, was born at Naperville, Ill.,\r\nand is living in retirement at Maplewood, Mo. He was educated at\r\nNorthwestern College, Elmhurst College and Eden Theological Seminary. He\r\nserved churches in Indiana and Texas and from 1906 to 1936 was editor of\r\nthe _Evangelical Herald_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DIE SACH’ IST DEIN, a popular, effective melody, is of\r\nuncertain origin.

It has been\r\nrendered into English by such eminent translators as Frances Cox, H. J.\r\nBuckoll, and Catherine Winkworth. But in order to make a freer and more\r\nmodern use of the original, Percy Dearmer made this new translation for\r\n_Songs of Praise_, London, 1931, of which he was the editor.\r\n\r\nFor comments on J. F. Bahnmaier see Hymn 329.\r\n\r\nPercy Dearmer was born in London and educated at Oxford. After serving\r\nas vicar in the church of St. Mary the Virgin, Primrose Hill, he became\r\nProfessor of Ecclesiastical Art at King’s College, London. He was an\r\nauthority on hymnology and liturgies, and wrote extensively on these\r\nsubjects. His works include _The New Reformation_, _A Short Handbook of\r\nPublic Worship_, _The Story of the Prayer Book_, and _Songs of Praise\r\nDiscussed_.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GOTT SEI DANK appeared in Freylinghausen’s _Geistreiches\r\nGesangbuch_, Halle, 1704, where it is set to the hymn, “Gott sei Dank in\r\naller Welt.” It is also called “Lübeck,” “Berlin,” and “Carinthia.” The\r\ncomposer is unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE LORD’S SUPPER\r\n\r\n\r\n552.

It expresses the reverent joy\r\nthat should accompany the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper. The hymn is\r\nsung, invariably, in many German churches on communion occasions.\r\n\r\nJohann Franck was born at Guben, Brandenburg, the son of a lawyer, and\r\nwas himself educated for the law. At the University of Königsberg he was\r\ngreatly influenced by Simon Dach, Professor of Poetry, and, in spite of\r\nhis law practice and the holding of public offices, he became an\r\nimportant poet and hymn writer of his time, second only to Paul\r\nGerhardt. The dominant theme of his hymns is the mystical union of the\r\nsoul with the Savior. Franck’s hymns had appeared in the works of his\r\nfriends Weichman and Crüger, and later were published, 110 in all, at\r\nGuben, in 1674, in a volume entitled _Geistliches Sion_.\r\n\r\nThe hymn is a selection of stanzas 1, 2, 7, and 9 of the original.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, Catherine Winkworth, see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SCHMÜCKE DICH is a beautifully expressive tune by Johann\r\nCrüger, 1598-1662, first published in the composer’s _Praxis Pietatis\r\nMelica_, 1644. J. S. Bach used the tune for an organ setting which\r\nconstitutes one of the most beautiful of Bach organ chorales. Upon\r\nhearing it played by Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann wrote concerning the\r\nchorale:\r\n\r\n  Round the _cantus firmus_ hung golden garlands of leaves, and such\r\n  blissfulness was breathed from within it, that you yourself avowed\r\n  that if life was bereft of all hope and faith, this one chorale could\r\n  renew them for you. I was silent and went away dazed into God’s acre,\r\n  feeling acutely pained that I could lay no flower on his urn.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Johann Crüger see Hymn 242.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MORNING\r\n\r\n\r\n553.

It is one of the finest\r\nchorales in our collection.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Benjamin Schmolck see Hymn 505.\r\n\r\nThe translation is from _Lyra Germanica_, published by Catherine\r\nWinkworth, 1855. Our hymn is a selection of stanzas 1, 2, 4, and 3, in\r\nthat order, of the original seven stanzas.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Miss Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ LIEBSTER JESU appeared in the _Alterdorfer Gesangbuch_, 1671,\r\nset to the words, “Liebster Jesus, wir sind hier,” by Tobias\r\nClausnitzer. J. S. Bach made a setting for the tune, used in some hymn\r\nbooks, and also arranged it as a chorale prelude for the organ.\r\n\r\nThe composer of the tune, Johann Rudolph Ahle, 1625-73, received his\r\neducation at the Universities of Göttingen and Erfurt. He was elected\r\nCantor of St. Andreas’ Church, and director of the music school, at\r\nErfurt. Interested also in civic affairs, he was elected to the town\r\ncouncil at Mühlhausen in 1656, and made mayor in 1661. He became one of\r\nthe most radical reformers of church music, cultivating the simple\r\nchorale style and avoiding the polyphonic counterpoint then in use. Ahle\r\nwrote over 400 songs, many of which are still in use among the\r\nProtestant churches of England and America.\r\n\r\n\r\n553a.

He graduated from the\r\nUniversity of Leipzig in 1643 and became a chaplain in the Swedish army,\r\nfor a time, during the Thirty Years’ War. In 1649 he became minister at\r\nWeiden where he remained until his death.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ See 553 above.\r\n\r\n\r\n554.

After years of study and travel, he also settled down\r\nto a pastorate in Silesia. He was well versed in philosophy and\r\nchemistry, as well as theology, and his memory was so remarkable that he\r\nknew nearly the whole Bible by heart. He took special interest in the\r\nstudy of the Jewish Kabbala, the so-called secret wisdom of the rabbis,\r\nand his writings on this literature made him world famous. Knorr wrote\r\nseventy hymns, the present being the only one now in general use among\r\nEnglish speaking people.\r\n\r\nThe translator, Richard Massie, was the son of the Rev. R. Massie, a\r\nminister in the Anglican church. A man of wealth and leisure, he was\r\nable to devote himself to literature and gardening. His rock garden, a\r\nrare thing in those days, attracted wide attention. Massie and his\r\nmother and sisters are remembered for their quiet spirituality and\r\nsaintliness.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MORGENGLANZ DER EWIGKEIT is an adaptation of an air by Johann\r\nRudolph Ahle. The tune appeared in Freylinghausen’s _Gesangbuch_, Halle,\r\n1704, set to this hymn. Its beauty of melody and rhythm is\r\nextraordinary. For comments on the composer see Hymn 553.\r\n\r\n\r\n555.

Isaak was kapellmeister of Lorenzo the Magnificent and later\r\nof Maximilian of Vienna. The tune was first published, so far as is\r\nknown, in Nürnberg, 1539, in a different version, set to the words,\r\n“Innsbruck ich muss dich lassen.” Later it was adapted to the hymn, “O\r\nWelt ich muss dich lassen,” and then to Gerhardt’s evening hymn, “Nun\r\nruhen alle Wälder.” The melody has appeared in many different forms in\r\nGerman collections. The arrangement here is that made by J. S. Bach and\r\nused in his _St. Matthew Passion_ and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n557.

He became church organist when only twelve years\r\nold and afterwards, in succession, lecturer at the University of\r\nWittenberg, Professor of Theology at Jena, and pastor of St. Thomas’\r\nChurch at Leipzig. He wrote Latin verse and composed many German hymns\r\nbut is chiefly known through this evening hymn. The English rendering of\r\nit we owe to Robert Bridges’ _Yattendon Hymnal_. It was made to suit\r\nBach’s setting of the Proper tune, and freely though finely expands\r\nstanzas 1 and 9 of the original.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Robert Bridges see Hymn 32.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ACH BLEIB BEI UNS, “one of the most famous of German chorales,”\r\nappeared in _Geistliche Lieder_, Leipzig, 1589, and in other\r\ncontemporary collections.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Seth Calvisius, 1556-1615, was the son of poor parents,\r\nbut succeeded in obtaining an education at the Universities of Helmstedt\r\nand Leipzig. He was an astronomer and chronologer, besides being a\r\nmusician, and was offered the Chair of Mathematics at Wittenberg in\r\n1611. Calvisius refused the offer in order to devote himself to music.\r\nAfter holding various musical posts in churches in Leipzig and\r\nSchulpforta, he became music director at the Thomaskirche in the former\r\ncity. Calvisius wrote treatises on the theory of music and published\r\nseveral collections of his own and others’ music, among them _Hymni\r\nSacri Latini et Germanici_, 1594, in which this tune appears in the alto\r\nas a descant to another melody.

It is based on Psalm\r\n37:5: “Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall\r\nbring it to pass.” The initial words of each stanza form an acrostic of\r\nthe German version: “Befiehl dem Herrn deine Wege, und hoff auf ihn; er\r\nwird es wohlmachen.” The hymn first appeared in Crüger’s _Praxis_, 1646.\r\nIt expresses the simple trust in God that supported Gerhardt through the\r\ntroubles that arose out of the Thirty Years’ War, as well as his own\r\npersonal sorrows.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Gerhardt see Hymn 134.\r\n\r\nOf the many translations of this hymn, this one by John Wesley remains\r\nthe most popular. It was published in 16 four-line stanzas in his _Hymns\r\nand Sacred Poems_, 1739, with the title, “Trust in Providence.” Since\r\nthe hymn was written in Short Meter, the editors of the _Hymnary_ had to\r\nabridge the third line of each stanza to fit this tune with its 7.6.7.6.\r\nmeter, a practice which Wesley himself would have heartily condemned.\r\nWesley’s unaltered version of his eight stanzas used here are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                   1.\r\n    Commit thou all thy griefs\r\n    And ways into His hands,\r\n  To His sure truth and tender care\r\n    Who earth and heaven commands.\r\n\r\n                                   2.\r\n    Who points the clouds their course,\r\n    Whom winds and seas obey,\r\n  He shall direct thy wandering feet,\r\n    He shall prepare thy way.\r\n\r\n                                   3.\r\n    Thou on the Lord rely,\r\n    So safe shalt thou go on;\r\n  Fix on His work thy steadfast eye,\r\n    So shall thy work be done.\r\n\r\n                                   4.\r\n    No profit canst thou gain\r\n    By self-consuming care;\r\n  To Him commend thy cause; His ear\r\n    Attends the softest prayer.\r\n\r\n                                   5.\r\n    Thy everlasting truth,\r\n    Father, Thy ceaseless love,\r\n  Sees all Thy children’s wants, and knows\r\n    What best for each will prove.\r\n\r\n                                   6.\r\n    And whatsoe’er Thou will’st\r\n    Thou dost, O King of kings;\r\n  What Thy unerring wisdom chose,\r\n    Thy power to being brings.\r\n\r\n                                   7.\r\n    Thou everywhere hast sway,\r\n    And all things serve Thy might;\r\n  Thy every act pure blessing is,\r\n    Thy path unsullied light.\r\n\r\n                                   8.\r\n    When Thou arisest, Lord,\r\n    Who shall Thy work withstand?\r\n  When all Thy children want, Thou giv’st;\r\n    Who, who, shall stay Thy hand?\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the hymn, in Wesley’s translation, is found at No.\r\n246.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Wesley see Hymn 170.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune, BEFIEHL DU DEINE WEGE, appears anonymously in the\r\n_Gesangbuch mit Noten_. It is probably of American origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n559. Abide with us, our Savior               _Josua Stegmann_, 1588-1632\r\n                                                         _Tr.

It originally appeared in the author’s\r\n_Christliches Gebetsbüchlein_, Rinteln, 1627, and later in his\r\n_Erneuerte Hertzen-Seufzer_, 1630, under the title, “For the Blessing\r\nand Support of the Ministry,” to be used as a closing hymn after the\r\n“Prayer for the Preservation of the Doctrine, and of the Church of God.”\r\n\r\nOur version is a free translation of stanzas 1 to 3 as it appeared,\r\nanonymously, in the Dalston Hospital _Hymn Book_, 1848, and as repeated\r\nin the Pennsylvania Lutheran _Church Book_, 1868.\r\n\r\nJosua Stegmann, son of a Lutheran pastor, was born at Sülzfeld, Germany.\r\nHe was educated at the Universities of Leipzig and Wittenberg. After\r\nholding several positions as teacher and pastor, he became Professor of\r\nTheology at Rinteln. With the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War, he was\r\nforced to flee but returned after several years. He suffered much at the\r\nhands of his Catholic opponents. Benedictine monks claimed to be the\r\nrightful professors and demanded the restoration of certain church\r\nproperties. At one time soldiers were sent into Stegmann’s house,\r\ndemanding a refund of his salary, compelling him to a public\r\ndisputation, and otherwise subjecting him to humiliation.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ACH BLEIB MIT DEINER GNADE is a simple but lovely tune,\r\npermeated with a feeling of deep serenity, fitting the present hymn\r\nperfectly. It appeared in the composer’s _Ein Schön Geistlich\r\nGesangbuch_, Jena, 1609, set to the hymn, “Christus, der ist mein\r\nLeben,” by which name the tune is also known. J. S. Bach used the melody\r\nin his chorale cantata, _Christus, der ist mein Leben_.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Melchior Vulpius, c. 1560-1616, was precentor at Weimar\r\nabout 1600. He composed a number of tunes and published them in his _Ein\r\nschön geistlich Gesangbuch, &c., durch M.V. Cantorem zu Weymar_. Others\r\nof his tunes were published after his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n560.

His literary work is\r\n_Psalterion_ published in Essen, 1825, a collection of his hymns,\r\nseveral of which passed into general use in the Lutheran churches of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe translator has not been identified.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GOTT IST GETREU is a melody contributed by J. R. Ahle, in his\r\n_Geistliche Arien_, 1662, where it is set to the hymn, “Es ist genug,”\r\nby Franz Burmeister.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Ahle see Hymn 553.\r\n\r\n\r\n561.

Her father had been a\r\nteacher in a Gymnasium at Riga, later moving to Mitau where he held a\r\ngovernment position. Julie, never in vigorous health, was a shy,\r\nretiring young woman, but keen of intellect. On several occasions she\r\naccepted positions as governess in private homes but was always\r\ncompelled to give up on account of her health. She finally dismissed all\r\nthoughts of a career and devoted herself to the care of her father who\r\nhad become blind, until the latter’s death in 1864. The following two\r\nyears she lived with a married sister in Germany and Switzerland and\r\nthen accompanied her younger sister to Biarritz in southern France where\r\nthe latter held a position as organist. In 1870 both went to St.\r\nPetersburg to be with two other sisters, one of them employed as\r\nDirector of St. Annenschule. The family circle was broken in 1896 and\r\n1898 upon the death of the youngest and oldest sister. In 1901 Julie\r\nsettled with relatives near Wösso in Estonia. In spite of old age and\r\nweak eyesight, she was busily engaged, until her death, with charities\r\nand literary work. She published a devotional book, _Hausbrot_, and,\r\nupon the insistence of a friend, Gustav Knak, her lyrics were published\r\nin three volumes, entitled, _Maiblumen. Lieder einer Stillen im Lande_.\r\n“So nimm denn mein Hände” appeared in _Maiblumen_, 1862, Vol I. It has\r\nbeen translated into many languages.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, H. Brueckner, see Hymn 517.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SO NIMM DENN MEINE HÄNDE first appeared with the present hymn\r\nin 1883. The tune was composed by Friedrich Silcher, 1789-1860, a German\r\nmusician, born at Schnaith, Württemberg. For 43 years Silcher was the\r\ndirector of music and organist at the University of Tübingen. He\r\ncomposed popular songs and hymns, and a cantata.\r\n\r\n\r\n562.

The\r\nhymn is credited, erroneously, to Gerhard Tersteegen, in the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\nA number of Hiller’s hymns have been translated but this one apparently\r\nhad never before been put into English. Our translation, consisting of\r\nstanzas 1, 2, 4, and 5, was made especially for the _Hymnary_ by Sister\r\nFrieda Kaufman who was for many years associated with the Bethel\r\nDeaconess Hospital, Newton, Kansas. Sister Frieda was born near Basel,\r\nSwitzerland; came with her parents to Halstead, Kansas; and attended\r\nBethel College. After graduating from a nursing course in Cincinnati,\r\nOhio, she received her deaconess garb and has since been known as\r\n“Sister Frieda.” From 1908 to 1943 she served as sister-in-charge of the\r\nhospital and during much of that time served also as its superintendent.\r\nShe had much to do with the planning of the Home for the Aged which is\r\noperated in connection with the hospital. To these two institutions she\r\ndevoted her rare gifts and set for them a high standard of Christian\r\nservice. Sister Frieda had unusual literary and artistic endowments and\r\ntranslated several German hymns into English.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ERBARMUNG is a popular Swiss melody which appeared anonymously\r\nin the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_.

Winckler was a Lutheran pastor of the early Pietistic group.\r\nAfter receiving his education in the University of Leipzig, he held\r\nimportant church posts in the city of Magdeburg, climaxed by his\r\nappointment as chief preacher at the Cathedral. He made enemies in\r\nMagdeburg on several occasions, first, by his stand against\r\ntheater-going, and afterwards, by his well-meant though futile attempt\r\nto bring about a closer union between the Lutheran and Reformed Churches\r\nin Prussia. But he bore his opposition with Christian patience and\r\nfortitude. His hymns, all of them lengthy, are distinguished by a firm\r\nfaith and earnestness. They represent the better productions of the\r\nearly Pietistic writers of Germany.\r\n\r\nOur version is a translation of stanzas 1, 13, and 16, by Miss\r\nWinkworth, from her _Chorale Book for England_, 1863.

The\r\ntune appears in a number of hymn books, sometimes with slight\r\nadaptations, and given such names at “Batty,” “Turnan,” and\r\n“Invitation.” The composer remains anonymous.\r\n\r\n\r\n564.

Peter the Great, the\r\nirreligious Czar of Russia, of all people, had the hymn done into the\r\nRussian language, and it has also been translated into Estonian.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Johann Franck, see Hymn 552.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, Catherine Winkworth, see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ JESU MEINE FREUDE is an adaptation of a traditional melody\r\nfound in J.

Born in Breslau, Silesia, the son of Lutheran\r\nparents, he studied in the Universities of Strassburg, Leyden, and\r\nPadua, graduating with the degrees of Ph.D. and M.D. Early in life he\r\nbecame deeply interested in the famous shoemaker, Jacob Böhme, a mystic\r\nand writer of popular books on the inner life. As a result of his\r\nstudies in mysticism, Scheffler left the Lutherans and became a priest\r\nin the Roman Catholic Church. He then gave up the medical profession to\r\ndevote himself to writing and the priesthood. Scheffler’s hymns, on the\r\nwhole, are, however, not distinctly Roman Catholic in sentiment, and\r\nthey became much more popular among the Lutherans and Moravians than\r\namong the Catholics. Scheffler wrote under the nom de plume, “Angelus\r\nSilesius,” “Angelus” being the name of a Spanish mystic who influenced\r\nhim greatly, to which he added “Silesius” to indicate his native\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe translation was made especially for the _Hymnary_, by Mrs. Joanna\r\nAndres, Newton, Kansas. The hymn is unusual in its use of the personal\r\npronoun “I” in the first three stanzas.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MIR NACH! SPRICHT CHRISTUS UNSER HELD is a popular tune\r\ncomposed by Johann Hermann Schein (misspelled “Rhein” in the _Hymnary_\r\nand the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_).\r\n\r\nFor comments on Schein see Hymn 508.\r\n\r\n\r\n566.

Gastorius in turn composed the tune on his sick bed,\r\nrequesting that the hymn be sung at his funeral. The condition of his\r\nhealth turned for the better whereupon Gastorius ordered his choir to\r\nsing the hymn at the door of his house once each week during the period\r\nof his convalescence. The music and words became widely known and are\r\nused throughout the whole of German Protestantism. The hymn appeared\r\nfirst in _Hannoversches Gesangbuch_, 1676. The melody appeared in the\r\n_Auserlesenes Weimarisches Gesangbuch_, 1681.\r\n\r\nThe translation, stanzas 1, 2, and 6 of the original, is Miss\r\nWinkworth’s in her _Chorale Book for England_, 1863.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Catherine Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n\r\n568.

The tune is of pre-Reformation origin.\r\nIt is an adaptation from an Easter _Gloria_ of anonymous composition,\r\nand appears with variants in different collections. Many settings of the\r\ntune have been made by Bach and other great composers, the one here\r\nbeing by Mendelssohn, used in his oratorio, _St. Paul_.\r\n\r\n\r\n569.

The hymn was first published in _Geistreiches\r\nGesangbuch_, Halle, 1697, and appeared again in Freylinghausen’s\r\n_Gesangbuch_, 1704.\r\n\r\nBartholomäus Crasselius, son of a cooper, was born in Wernsdorf, Saxony.\r\nHe became an ardent disciple of A. H. Francke, leader of the Pietistic\r\nmovement at Halle. Crasselius was an aggressive advocate of the new\r\nlife. As Lutheran pastor at Nidda, and later at Düsseldorf, he was known\r\nfor his unrestrained testimony against the people and the times.\r\nCrasselius was nearly always in conflict with the authorities and at one\r\ntime was suspended four weeks from his office and punished with fines\r\nand imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe translation, consisting of stanzas 1 and 2, is somewhat altered from\r\nCatherine Winkworth’s as it appeared in her _Chorale Book for England_,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Catherine Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DIR, DIR JEHOVAH has been coupled with this text since its\r\nfirst publication in 1704 in Freylinghausen’s _Gesangbuch_. It is an\r\naltered form of a melody set to “Wer nur den lieben Gott lässt walten,”\r\npublished in the _Musikalisches Handbuch_, Hamburg, 1690. The composer\r\nis not known. In England the tune was altered to fit the long meter\r\nhymn, “Ride on, ride on in majesty,” and is called “Winchester New.” See\r\nHymn 369.\r\n\r\n\r\n570. The Spirit of the Lord revealed           _George W. Briggs_, 1875—\r\n\r\nA hymn on the Scriptures, setting forth the truth that what the Spirit\r\nof God revealed dimly in the Old Testament was fulfilled in the New\r\nTestament by the Incarnate Word which is Jesus Christ. George W. Briggs\r\nwrote the hymn for _Songs of Praise_, London, 1931.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Briggs see Hymn 307.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ AUS MEINES HERZENS GRUNDE, also known as “Wolder,” is a\r\ntraditional tune of anonymous origin. It is found in D. Wolder’s _Neu\r\nCatechismus Gesangbüchlein_, Hamburg, 1588, but is doubtless much older\r\nthan this book. In the _Gesangbuch mit Noten_ the tune is set to the\r\nwords, “Aus meines Herzens Grunde,” by J. Matthesius, from which it\r\nderives its name.\r\n\r\n\r\n571. He who would be in God confiding           _Georg Neumark_, 1621-81\r\n                                                        _Tr. J. J.

The heading given it by the\r\nauthor was:\r\n\r\n  A Song of Comfort. God will care for and help every one in His own\r\n  time. Cast thy burden on the Lord and He shall sustain thee. Psalm\r\n  55:22.\r\n\r\nThe hymn arose out of the author’s personal need and suffering. On his\r\nway to Königsberg, to attend the University at that place, Neumark was\r\nrobbed of his money and stripped of all his possessions except his\r\nprayer book and a small amount of cash which, he had sewn into his\r\nclothing. He was therefore destitute and in despair, with no prospect of\r\ngoing to school or making a living. After many privations, he at last\r\nreceived an appointment as private tutor in the family of a judge at\r\nKiel, “which good fortune, coming suddenly and as if fallen from\r\nheaven,” he wrote, “greatly rejoiced me, and on that very day I composed\r\nto the honour of my beloved Lord the hymn, well known here and there,\r\n‘Wer nur den lieben Gott lässt walten,’ and had certainly cause enough\r\nto thank the Divine compassion for such unlooked-for grace shown to me.”\r\n\r\nNeumark was now able to enter the University and became a student of law\r\nand poetry. After years of hardship, he finally had the good fortune of\r\nbeing appointed court poet, librarian, and registrar to Duke Wilhelm II\r\nof Saxe-Weimar, and custodian of the ducal archives. Shortly before his\r\ndeath in 1681 he became blind. The hymns he wrote during his prosperous\r\nyears were markedly inferior to those written during his earlier years\r\nof hardship and privation.\r\n\r\nThe translation was made by Rev. J. J. Voth, North Newton, Kansas, then\r\na member of the Bethel College staff, and pastor of the Gnadenberg\r\nMennonite Church near Whitewater, Kansas. There is also a fine\r\ntranslation of this hymn, by Catherine Winkworth.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WER NUR DEN LIEBEN GOTT is wrongly attributed in the _Hymnary_\r\nto the author of the words. Neumark wrote an extraordinarily fine tune,\r\nin the minor mode, for these words, used in many collections, including\r\nthe Canadian Mennonite _Gesangbuch_, 1942. The present tune is simpler\r\nand more popular than Neumark’s. The composer is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n572. Our Lord, His passion ended             _Francis C. Burkitt_, 1864—\r\n\r\nA hymn for Whitsuntide.\r\n\r\nFrancis Crawford Burkitt, born in London, is a scholar of wide repute in\r\nEngland, the author of many linguistic and theological works. He holds\r\nhonorary degrees from the Universities of Edinburgh, Dublin, St.\r\nAndrews, and Oxford. Burkitt was, for many years, Professor of Divinity\r\nin Cambridge University.\r\n\r\nThe meter of the hymn is unique in that the second quatrain of each\r\nstanza changes from the common lambic (- —) to the Trochaic (— -).\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FORTEM VIRILI PECTORE, of unknown origin, has much of the\r\ncharacter of a German folk tune. It appears in various editions of the\r\n_Catholisches Gesangbuch_, Strassburg, 1697 and onwards, set to a German\r\nversion of the words, “Fortem virili pectore.”\r\n\r\n\r\n573.

Stanzas 2, 3, and 5 were special favorites in Germany,\r\nstanza 5 having been adopted by children, by brides, by old and young,\r\nas a morning prayer. Concerning this hymn, Dr. Cosack, a Königsberg\r\nwriter, says:\r\n\r\n  For two hundred years it is hardly likely that a single day has\r\n  greeted the earth that has not, here and there, in German lands, been\r\n  met with Albert’s hymn. Hardly another morning hymn can be compared\r\n  with it, as far as popularity and intrinsic value are concerned, if\r\n  simplicity and devotion, purity of doctrine and adaptation to all the\r\n  circumstances of life are to decide.\r\n\r\nThe author, Heinrich Albert, was the son of a tax collector at\r\nLobenstein, Voigtland. He began the study of music under his uncle,\r\nHeinrich Schütz, Court Kapellmeister at Dresden, but abandoned it, at\r\nthe desire of his parents, to become a lawyer. The profession of law\r\nhad, however, little interest for him and he returned to his first love,\r\naccepting, in 1631, the position of organist of the Cathedral of\r\nKönigsberg. Albert wrote several hundred secular and sacred poems and\r\ncomposed in all 78 sacred melodies. Most of the former were published in\r\nhis _Etliche Arien_.\r\n\r\nThe hymn has been rendered into English by five or six eminent\r\ntranslators. Johann Christian Jacobi, a native of Germany who was Keeper\r\nof the Royal German Chapel, St. James Palace, London, for 42 years, made\r\na translation of this hymn which he included in his _Divine Hymns_,\r\n1720. Our second stanza, slightly altered, is the work of his hand.\r\n\r\nArthur Tozer Russell, an Anglican clergyman and prolific writer,\r\ntranslated many hymns and composed about 140 original hymns besides a\r\nlarge number of chants and hymn tunes. To him belongs the credit for our\r\n3d stanza which is a translation of stanza 6 of the original. Russell’s\r\ntranslations, on the whole, are “vigorous and strong, but somewhat\r\nultra-faithful to the original metres.”\r\n\r\nCatherine Winkworth made a full translation of Albert’s hymn for her\r\n_Lyra Germanica_, 1st Ser. 1855. Our first verse is taken from this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Miss Winkworth see Hymn 236.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ GOTT DES HIMMELS UND DER ERDEN was composed by Albert, author\r\nof the words. The tune is known too by the names “Godesberg,” and\r\n“Waltham.” (See Hymn 370). J. S. Bach used the melody in his _Christmas\r\nOratorio_.\r\n\r\n\r\n574.

Stanzas 1, 3 and 4 are from\r\nZinzendorf’s “Seelenbräutigam, O du Gotteslamm,” a poem of 11 stanzas,\r\nwritten September 1721. The second stanza is from “Glanz der Ewigkeit,”\r\na 15-stanza poem, dated Berlin, May 1721.\r\n\r\nNicolaus Ludwig, Graf von Zinzendorf, was born at Dresden of a noble,\r\nwealthy and religious family. Early in life he came under the teaching\r\nof influential Pietists, having Philipp Spener for his godfather and\r\nAugustus Francke for his tutor. From his earliest years he had strong\r\nreligious impressions. As a child his favorite play was “preaching;” as\r\na boy in school he organized the “Order of the Mustard Seed,” the\r\nmembers of which bound themselves in a special manner to the service of\r\nChrist, and above all to promote the conversion of the heathen. Upon the\r\ninsistence of non-pietistic relatives, he attended the University of\r\nWittenberg to study law and to acquire such accomplishments as dancing,\r\nfencing, and shooting, but he himself would have preferred the study of\r\ntheology.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 21, Zinzendorf bought an estate in Saxony with the view of\r\ngathering a number of truly religious persons into a community, which\r\nshould be a source of new religious life. He invited a group of Moravian\r\nexiles, a religious body which sprang from the work of John Hus, to\r\nsettle on the estate. Thus was formed, in 1722, the Moravian settlement\r\nwhich took the name Herrnhut, “Shelter of the Lord.” The colony grew\r\nrapidly and attracted to its numbers not only immigrants from Moravia\r\nbut many others. In 1727 Zinzendorf gave up his post as an official at\r\nthe Court of the King of Saxony, to join the Moravian colony and\r\nsuperintend the growing community. Accusing him of spreading false\r\ndoctrines, his opponents secured an edict from the king, banishing\r\nZinzendorf from Saxony. During this exile, which lasted 10 years, he was\r\nengaged in unceasing missionary efforts, from St. Petersburg to the West\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nIn 1741, Zinzendorf came to America to visit the Moravians in\r\nPennsylvania to organize them into congregations and encourage them to\r\ndo missionary work among both whites and Indians. Under his leadership,\r\nthe Moravians became a famous missionary group. As early as 1731, two of\r\nthe Brethren were sent to the West Indies and two to Greenland. And in\r\nZinzendorf’s lifetime Moravians were at work in Europe, Asia, Africa,\r\nNorth and South America. In a few years, the little colony at Herrnhut\r\nhad sent out more missionaries than had gone from all European\r\nProtestantism during two centuries. They went to the hardest and most\r\ndangerous places and the most unpromising peoples. Everywhere they were\r\nstrengthened by the joyful, confident faith and loyalty to Christ\r\nexpressed in Zinzendorf’s hymn, “Jesu geh voran.”\r\n\r\nThe Moravians had a powerful influence on hymnology. Zinzendorf himself,\r\nall the members of his family, and most of the early leaders wrote\r\nhymns. Singing was a prominent part of their worship and they early\r\nbegan publishing hymnbooks. Concerning Zinzendorf’s hymns, Catherine\r\nWinkworth says in her _Christian Singers of Germany_:\r\n\r\n  His hymns, of which he wrote more than two thousand, are of\r\n  exceedingly different value; some are fantastic and irreverent, some\r\n  mere rhymed prose, others again have a real sweetness, fervour, and\r\n  song in them.\r\n\r\nShe cites “Jesu geh voran” as one of his best hymns.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the translator, Jane Borthwick, see Hymn 54.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SEELENBRÄUTIGAM is a tune of a “pleasingly ingenious tinge,\r\nvery simply constructed.” It is found in many English hymnbooks.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Adam Drese, 1620-1701, was born in Thuringia. He became\r\ndirector of music at the Court of Count Wilhelm IV of Saxe-Weimar; then\r\nwas appointed kapellmeister in Weimar, and later at Arnstadt, living\r\nmeanwhile a life of selfish indulgence in the atmosphere of the courts.\r\nUpon reading the works of Spener and Luther’s _Introduction to the\r\nEpistle to the Romans_, Drese experienced a spiritual awakening which\r\nled him to aggressive missionary efforts and the organization of prayer\r\nmeetings in the community. He wrote hymns and tunes which were sung at\r\nthe meetings of pious persons in his house, before they came into print.\r\n\r\nThe tune was first published in the _Hallesches Gesangbuch_, 1695, but\r\nit was used in manuscript form as early as 1690, in the composer’s home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BOOK V\r\n                            Metrical Psalms\r\n\r\n\r\n575. That man hath perfect blessedness                         _Psalm I_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 1. The Tree and the Chaff.\r\n\r\nThe psalm embodies a fundamental teaching of the Old Testament, namely,\r\nthat true happiness is to be found only in knowing and serving God.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DUNFERMLINE is a Scottish tune of unknown origin. The name is\r\nthat of a town in Scotland. It appeared as one of the twelve “Common\r\nTunes” (tunes not attached to any particular psalms) in _The CL Psalms\r\nof David, &c._, Edinburgh, 1615. In England the tune was included in\r\nRavencroft’s _Whole Book of Psalms_, 1621.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note on the Scottish Psalter, 1650\r\n\r\nThe origin of the _Scottish Psalter_, 1650, which is the source of\r\nnearly all the metrical psalms in Book Five of the _Hymnary_, may be\r\nbriefly summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nThe church in Scotland, at the time of the Reformation, modeled its\r\nservice after Calvin’s in Geneva. No hymns were permitted to be sung;\r\nonly the Words of inspired Scripture were allowed for use in worship.\r\nFor two hundred years after Luther had inspired a rich treasury of\r\n“man-made” poems for use in congregational singing, the Calvinistic\r\nchurches were still using only psalms and paraphrases of Scripture.\r\n\r\nIn compiling a Psalter, the Scottish reformers adopted the entire\r\n_Anglo-Genevan Psalter_ used by John Knox, to which they added\r\nselections from the English _Old Version_ by Sternhold and Hopkins, and\r\n21 more by Scottish writers. Tunes, over 100 in all, were adopted from\r\nthe Anglo-Genevan, French, and English Psalters, in each case the melody\r\nonly being printed. In 1635 an edition was published with the tunes in\r\nharmony, the work of Edmund Millar.\r\n\r\nIn 1643, the House of Commons and the Westminster Assembly, interested\r\nin establishing uniformity of worship between the churches of England\r\nand Scotland, voted to adopt Francis Rous’ version of the psalms for use\r\nthroughout the kingdom, after extensive revisions of the work. The\r\nScottish church, not satisfied with the Rous’ version, appointed a\r\ncommission of four men to revise it still farther, largely to satisfy\r\nthe Puritan demand for more literalness to the Hebrew original. The\r\nresult of this revision was the classic _Scottish Psalter_ of 1650,\r\nstill in use in Scottish Presbyterianism and in American Covenanter\r\nChurches. The renderings are quaint and rude in spots but their\r\nfaithfulness and vigor cannot be denied. It is in this form that\r\nmillions of people have learned to love the psalms and all attempts to\r\nimprove or modernize them have so far failed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no tunes were provided with the _Scottish Psalter_ of\r\n1650. This limited the singing to such tunes as precentor and people\r\nknew by heart, resulting in a long period of decline in church music in\r\nthe Church of Scotland. Later editions corrected this defect. In 1929,\r\nthe General Assemblies of the Church of Scotland and the United Free\r\nChurch of Scotland, then entered into union, published a new edition of\r\nthe _Scottish Psalter_, with 192 tunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n576. Lord, Thou shalt early hear my voice                      _Psalm V_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 5:3, 4, 7, 11. A Prayer for Divine Aid.\r\n\r\nA morning prayer in which the Psalmist confidently looks to God, assured\r\nof an answer. He shows a deep concern for ethical purity and sincerity\r\nin worship.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ For comments on WARWICK see Hymn 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n577. Within Thy tabernacle, Lord                              _Psalm XV_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 15. The Friend of God.\r\n\r\nThe psalm speaks of the type of life that brings man into the Divine\r\nPresence and makes of him a good citizen.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ TALLIS’ ORDINAL. For comments on this tune see Hymn 326.\r\n\r\n\r\n578. God’s law is perfect, and converts                      _Psalm XIX_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 19:7-11. God’s Praise in the Moral Universe.\r\n\r\nThe psalm describes God’s revelation to man. God is revealed to us “in\r\nthe starry heavens above and in the moral law within,” (to use the\r\nphrase of Immanuel Kant). The hymn, composed of verses 7-11, deals only\r\nwith the latter, the law in the heart.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. ANDREW appeared in _The New Harmony of Sion_ by William\r\nTans’ur, in 1764, where it was set to Psalm 150, and inscribed “Barby\r\nTune, composed in four parts, W.T.” The initials may mean only that the\r\nharmony was by Tans’ur.\r\n\r\nFor comments on William Tans’ur see Hymn 74.\r\n\r\n\r\n579. The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want                 _Psalm XXIII_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 23. The Good Shepherd Psalm. It has probably been translated and\r\nparaphrased more frequently than any other piece of literature in the\r\nworld, yet always carries the same joyous and sure faith in the Good\r\nShepherd. A version by James Montgomery is found at No. 62.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ MARTYRDOM. For comments on this tune see Hymn 108.\r\n\r\n\r\n580. Ye gates, lift up your heads on high                   _Psalm XXIV_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 24:7-10. A Marching Chorus and Triumphant Song of Victory.\r\n\r\nThe procession escorting the ark, symbol of God’s presence, has now\r\nreached the city gates and Jerusalem is called upon to open wide its\r\ngates to its true King. “Raise up your arches, O gates, and open wide\r\nyour ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter in.” The full glory\r\nof God can come into our lives only as we enlarge the receiving\r\nfacilities of our hearts and minds.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. GEORGE’S, EDINBURGH was composed especially for these words\r\nby Dr. Andrew Thomson, minister of the church by the above name in\r\nEdinburgh. It became the custom in many places in Scotland for the\r\ncongregation to sing this psalm at Communion while ministers and elders\r\nin solemn procession brought the bread and wine into the church before\r\nthe administration of the sacrament.\r\n\r\nAndrew Thomson, 1778-1831, trained in the University of Edinburgh, was\r\nan outstanding Scottish Presbyterian preacher and leading public figure\r\nin Edinburgh. He had musical gifts and set himself to improve the\r\npsalmody of his church and composed a number of tunes. In collaboration\r\nwith his precentor, R. A. Smith, he compiled several collections of\r\npsalms and hymns. He also published books of sermons and lectures and\r\nwrote numerous magazine articles. Thomson died suddenly within a few\r\nsteps of his own door when returning from a Presbytery meeting. His son\r\nbecame professor of music in the University of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n581. Show me thy ways, O Lord                                _Psalm XXV_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 25:4-7. A Prayer to God for Guidance and Forgiveness.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. BRIDE appeared in _Parochial Harmony; consisting of a\r\ncollection of Psalm tunes in three and four parts, &c._, by William\r\nRiley, 1762, where it was set to the new version of Psalm 130 and headed\r\n“St. Bridget’s Tune by Mr. Sam’l Howard.” The tune is in strict\r\npsalm-tune style and therefore simple in structure. But it has strength\r\nand high quality and is deserving of its wide and continuous use.\r\n\r\nSamuel Howard, 1710-82, London musician, was organist of St. Clement\r\nDanes and of St. Bride’s churches. He was a popular composer of both\r\nsacred and secular music.\r\n\r\n\r\n582. The Lord’s my light and saving health                 _Psalm XXVII_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 27:1-5. A Song of Assurance.\r\n\r\nThese verses reflect a confidence that knows no fear in the midst of\r\ndanger, because of God’s protecting care.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. MAGNUS, also called “Nottingham,” is a “good solid melody,\r\nbuilt on familiar lines.” It appeared, anonymously, in 1709 in a book\r\ncalled _The Divine Companion: or David’s Harp new tuned. Being a choice\r\ncollection of New and Easy Psalms, Hymns and Anthems._ In 1762 the tune,\r\nbearing its present name and assigned to Jeremiah Clark, appeared in W.\r\nRiley’s _Parochial Harmony_. In Gawthorn’s _Harmonia Perfecta_, 1730, it\r\nis named “Nottingham.”\r\n\r\nThe composer, Jeremiah Clark, 1670-1707, a Londoner of keen sensibility\r\nand gifted musicianship, wrote operatic music, a cantata, numerous\r\nsongs, and church music-anthems and psalm tunes. In a mood of\r\ndespondency he took his own life.\r\n\r\n\r\n583. Through all the changing scenes of life               _Psalm XXXIV_\r\n                                     _New Version, Tate and Brady_, 1698\r\n\r\nPsalm 34:1-10, 22. The Goodness of God.\r\n\r\nA hymn of praise to God for his care and protection in time of great\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nMost of our metrical psalms in the _Hymnary_ are from the _Scottish\r\nPsalter_, 1650. (See under Hymn 575.) But this one is from the revised\r\nedition of 1698, of the _New Version of the Psalms_ first published in\r\nEngland in 1696, by the two Irishmen, Tate and Brady. This version\r\npartly supplanted in England the older version of Sternhold and Hopkins.\r\n\r\nNahum Tate, 1652-1715, son of an Irish clergyman, was a literary man,\r\nplaywright, and a poet. Finally, to the surprise of everyone, he became\r\npoet laureate, by appointment of William III.\r\n\r\nNicholas Brady, 1659-1726?, received the degree of D.D. from Dublin\r\nUniversity and had a varied clerical career in Ireland and England,\r\nfinally becoming chaplain to King William. Brady and Tate collaborated\r\nto produce the _New Version_, a work which received royal endorsement\r\nand was officially adopted in England. Though better in smoothness and\r\nliterary grace than the versions of Sternhold and Hopkins, very little\r\nof it remains in modern hymnals. This hymn and “As pants the hart,”\r\n(586), are among the gems still in use. “While shepherds watched their\r\nflocks by night” (73 and 74) a masterly adaptation of the Nativity\r\nstory, appeared in the supplement of the _New Version_, 1703, and is\r\nfound today in nearly all hymnals.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WILTSHIRE, known in Scotland as “New St. Ann,” appeared first\r\nin _Divine Amusement_, by Sir G. Grant, set to Psalm 48. The tune\r\nappears with variants in other collections.\r\n\r\nThe composer, George Thomas Smart, 1776-1867, was an organist and\r\ncomposer and a popular conductor of choral groups in London. He gave\r\nlessons in singing and harpsichord and composed anthems, chants and\r\npsalm tunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n584. O children, hither do ye come                         _Psalm XXXIV_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 34:11-19. The Goodness of God.\r\n\r\nThe psalmist here becomes a teacher, instructing his listeners in the\r\nright paths of life.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ARNOLD was first published in _The Psalms of David for the Use\r\nof Parish Churches. The Music celected, adapted, and composed by Dr.\r\nArnold ... assisted by J. W. Callcott_, 1791. The tune was set to Psalm\r\n15, arranged so that the first two lines should be sung as a duet by\r\nsoprano and alto, repeated as a duet by tenor and bass, and then the\r\nthird and fourth lines sung in full chorus. The present form of the tune\r\nis first found in Scotland in Robert Gilmore’s _Psalm Singer’s\r\nAssistant_ (undated, but before 1793).\r\n\r\nSamuel Arnold, 1740-1802, after ventures and heavy losses in the theater\r\nbusiness, received the degree of Mus. Doc. from Oxford and then became\r\norganist and composer to the Royal Chapel. Later he became conductor at\r\nthe Academy of Ancient Music, and in 1789 was appointed organist of\r\nWestminster Abbey. He wrote numerous songs, four oratorios and many\r\nanthems and edited important musical works, including _The Works of\r\nHandel_, in thirty-six volumes, at the request of King George III.\r\n\r\n\r\n585. I waited for the Lord my God                             _Psalm XL_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 40:1-5. A Prayer for Speedy Relief from Trouble.\r\n\r\nAfter long and patient waiting, the psalmist’s prayer for relief from\r\ntrouble has been answered, giving occasion for fresh thanksgiving for\r\nHis mercy.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ BALLERMA. For comments on this tune see Hymn 57.\r\n\r\nRobert Simpson, 1790-1832, who adapted this tune from a melody by F. H.\r\nBarthélemon (See Hymn 57) was a weaver by trade, but of good education\r\nand fine musical taste. He was choir-leader in a Congregational Church\r\nin Glasgow, then became precentor and session-clerk of the East Parish\r\nchurch at Greenock, at a salary of forty pounds a year, and from that\r\ntime onward made music his profession. Of weak constitution, he fell\r\nvictim of one of the cholera epidemics.\r\n\r\n\r\n586. As pants the hart for cooling streams                  _Psalm XLII_\r\n                                     _New Version, Tate and Brady_, 1698\r\n\r\nPsalm 42:1, 2, 5, 9, 11. Exiled from the House of God.\r\n\r\nThe psalmist, alone among taunting heathen strangers, yearns to return\r\nto the place of worship where he may again commune with God. His faith\r\nis sorely tried but it does not fail him. He recalls the mercy of God\r\nand renews his hope in God.\r\n\r\nFor comments on _New Version_, Tate and Brady, see Hymn 583.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SPOHR is an adaptation from the solo and chorus, “Though all\r\nthy friends forsake thee,” in _Calvary_, an oratorio by Spohr.\r\n\r\nLudwig Spohr, 1784-1859, a German musician, born at Brunswick, was a\r\ncomposer and noted violinist. He went annually on concert tours\r\nthroughout Europe, with brilliant success. Few musicians have enjoyed so\r\nhigh a reputation with their contemporaries. Many musicians of his time\r\nconsidered Spohr a greater composer than Beethoven. His reputation,\r\nhowever, did not stand the test of time, partly because his compositions\r\nare characterized by a peculiar chromaticism. Most of his numerous\r\nworks, including operas, oratorios, 34 string quartets, violin\r\nconcertos, etc., have been forgotten. His oratorios, _Calvary_ and _The\r\nLast Judgment_, lasted longest.\r\n\r\nThe tune, “St. Anne,” now fittingly sung to “O God our help in ages\r\npast,” (No. 61), was composed for this psalm, and may be used as an\r\nalternative tune. The Psalm has also been set to “Martyrdom” (579).\r\n\r\n\r\n587. O send Thy light forth and Thy truth                  _Psalm XLIII_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 43:3-5. Exiled from the House of God (continued).\r\n\r\nPsalm 43 is clearly a continuation of Psalm 42. The same spirit,\r\nlanguage and situation are to be found in both and each ends with the\r\nsame refrain. Psalm 42 speaks of God as a fountain of living water;\r\nPsalm 43, as a guiding light. These vivid metaphors are combined in\r\nPsalm 36:9: “For with Thee is the fountain of life; in Thy light do we\r\nsee light.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ FARRANT is adapted from an air in the anthem, “Lord, for thy\r\ntender mercies’ sake.” usually attributed to the English organist and\r\ncomposer, Richard Farrant, c. 1530-1580, but by some to John Hilton, and\r\nby others to William Mundy.\r\n\r\n\r\n588. God is our refuge and our strength                     _Psalm XLVI_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 46:1-5. The Mighty God.\r\n\r\nPsalm 46 has been a source of strength in time of dire distress,\r\nsustaining the spirit of the persecuted and dying, in all ages.\r\n\r\nOne should compare this version from the _Scottish Psalter_ with that of\r\nIsaac Watts (No. 257), and of Martin Luther in his classic hymn of the\r\nReformation, “Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott” (No. 549).\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ WINCHESTER OLD is from _Este’s Psalter_ which was entitled\r\n“_The Whole Booke of Psalmes with their wonted Tunes, as they are song\r\nin churches, composed into foure parts ... compiled by sondry authors_,”\r\nLondon, Thomas Este, 1592, where it is set to Psalm 84.\r\n\r\nThomas Este, 1540?-1608?, was a London printer and music publisher. He\r\nprinted an important edition of the psalter in 1592 in which the tunes\r\nwere harmonized in four parts by ten eminent musicians of the time. In\r\nhis dedicatory word Este wrote: “In this booke the Church Tunes are\r\ncarefully corrected, and other short tunes added, which are sung in\r\nLondon and other places of this Realme.” The Church Tunes (known also as\r\nProper Tunes), forty-six in all, were attached to their proper psalms\r\nand the remaining psalms were set to short, four line tunes, Common\r\nTunes, not attached to any particular psalms. Este’s book is the\r\nearliest example in which the voice parts are printed on opposite\r\npages—“Cantus and Tenor (i.e. the Melody) on the left-hand page, and the\r\nAltus and Bassus on the right”—instead of in separate books as was then\r\nthe custom. New editions of _Este’s Psalter_, with slight changes, were\r\npublished in 1594, 1604, and 1611. In the 19th century it had the honor\r\nof being reprinted by the Musical Antiquarian Society of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n589. After Thy loving-kindness, Lord                          _Psalm LI_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 51:1-3, 10, 17. A Prayer for Pardon.\r\n\r\nThe psalmist prays for pardon and cleansing, confessing the greatness of\r\nhis sins, and offering the sacrifice of a broken heart. Psalm 51 is the\r\nfourth of the seven psalms known from ancient times as the Penitential\r\nPsalms. The others are 6, 32, 38, 102, 130, and 143.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DUNDEE, also known as “Windsor,” is first found in Damon’s\r\n_Psalter_, which was entitled, _The Booke of the Musicke of M. William\r\nDamon, late one of her maiestes Musitions: conteining all the tunes of\r\nDavid’s Psalmes, as they are ordinarily sung in the Church; most\r\nexcellently by him composed into 4 parts_, 1591. The tune, DUNDEE, is\r\nthere set to Psalm 116.\r\n\r\nDamon’s _Psalter_ was one of the many private editions through which the\r\n_Old Version_ of Sternhold and Hopkins went, besides numerous official\r\neditions. William Damon, c.1540-c.91, was organist of the Chapel Royal\r\nunder Queen Elizabeth but is best known for the collection of psalms\r\nwhich he published in four parts. The work is in eight books, the first\r\nfour of which have the melody in the tenor, and the second four in the\r\nsoprano. Copies of Damon’s _Psalter_ are rare. A few are to be found in\r\nthe British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n590.

The Joy of the Godly.\r\n\r\nOne of the Songs of the Sanctuary, expressing the joy and happiness of\r\nthe pilgrim who, coming from afar, has at last arrived at the sanctuary\r\nof his God at Jerusalem. The vale of Baca (v. 6), a waterless, barren\r\nvalley through which he passed on the journey to Jerusalem, became, to\r\nthe devoted pilgrim, a place of springs and refreshment.\r\n\r\nThe version here is by John Milton and constitutes an improvement over\r\nthat in the _Scottish Psalter_.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Milton see Hymn 64.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SALZBURG.

All people that on earth do dwell                         _Psalm C_\r\n                                              _William Kethe_, _c._ 1561\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 100. The Faithful God.\r\n\r\nThe Psalm was used as a processional hymn to be chanted by the people as\r\nthey went up to the temple for worship.\r\n\r\nSclater, in _The Public Worship of God_, discussing opening hymns of\r\nadoration, says: “There is none better than that grand old Puritan\r\nanthem, the 100th Psalm, set to Louis Bourgeois’ noble tune,” and adds\r\nthat “those who are in perplexity to find hymns which precisely fit into\r\nvarious parts of the service might do a great deal worse than take a\r\nlook at the Scottish Metrical Psalms. They will find them peculiarly\r\nrich in the noblest and simplest form of opening adoration.”\r\n\r\nIn verse 4 the printer has omitted the question mark (?) after the word\r\n“why,” in the early editions of the _Hymnary_.\r\n\r\nWilliam Kethe, to whom this version is ascribed, was one of the exiles\r\nwith John Knox in Geneva during the persecutions of Mary, Queen of the\r\nScots. Little is known of him but his name has been immortalized by this\r\njustly renowned paraphrase of Psalm 100.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ OLD HUNDREDTH is the most famous of all Psalm tunes. It was\r\nadapted from a secular source by L. Bourgeois for Psalm 134 in the\r\n_Genevan Psalter_ of 1551. In later collections—the Genevan _Fourscore\r\nand Seven Psalms of David_, and John Day’s _Whole Book of Psalms_, both\r\npublished in 1561—the tune was attached to Kethe’s version of Psalm 100\r\nand has remained associated with this Psalm ever since. The tune is one\r\nof 46 known as “Proper” or “Church” tunes which are distinguished by the\r\nadjective “Old” prefixed to the number of the psalm to which they were\r\nattached. A later form of the melody, introduced about the middle of the\r\n18th century, is widely used with the “Doxology” (No. 618).\r\n\r\nFor comments on Louis Bourgeois see Hymn 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n595. Thou shalt arise, and mercy yet                         _Psalm CII_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 102:13-22. The Everlasting God.\r\n\r\nOne of the Penitential Psalms. (See under Hymn 589.)\r\n\r\nZion is in ruins and her people in exile, but God, who is unchangeable,\r\nwill yet fulfill His promises to His people and make Jerusalem the\r\ncenter of a world-wide worship.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DUKE STREET.

The Goodness of God.\r\n\r\nThe psalm sets forth with exquisite beauty and tenderness the enduring\r\ngoodness and mercy of God. It is a song of thanksgiving to God for his\r\nmany benefits and blessings.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in Scotland to sing the opening verses of this psalm\r\nas a song of thanksgiving and praise after the communicants had received\r\nthe bread and wine of the Lord’s Supper. The people poured evangelical\r\ncontent into the words, thinking as they sang, of the great redemption\r\nthrough Jesus Christ: “who doth redeem thy life, etc.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. PAUL. The origin of this tune is unknown. It appeared first\r\nin _A Collection of Twenty Church Tunes_, 1749, published by James\r\nChalmers, c. 1700-64, Aberdeen, Scotland, who was printer to the Town\r\nCouncil and publisher of _The Aberdeen Journal_. Only one copy of this\r\nsmall book is known to survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n597.

The Guardian God.\r\n\r\nA splendid picture of the fatherly goodness of God and His watchful\r\nProvidence over His people.\r\n\r\nThe version is by John Campbell, Duke of Argyll, who married Princess\r\nLouise, the daughter of Queen Victoria. At one time he was the\r\nGovernor-General of Canada and Commander-in-Chief of Prince Edward\r\nIsland. He was keeper of the seal of Scotland. Though engaged in many\r\nand varied activities, he was an earnest Christian and found pleasure in\r\nthe study of the Psalms and in making them available for use in\r\nChristian worship.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SANDON. For comments on this tune see Hymn 163.\r\n\r\n\r\n599. I joyed when to the house of God                      _Psalm CXXII_\r\n                                                _Scottish Psalter_, 1650\r\n\r\nPsalm 122. A Prayer for Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nA song of the pilgrims who, having arrived at the gates of Jerusalem,\r\nare filled with admiration for the Holy City. They are moved at its\r\nbeauty and strength, recall its past stories, and pray for its peace and\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nIn the church of Scotland it has been the traditional practice to sing\r\nverses 3, 4, and 5 of this hymn immediately before the Benediction which\r\ncloses the General Assembly. Sung to the stately tune of “St. Paul,” it\r\nleaves an indelible impression on the mind.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ ST. PAUL. For comments on this tune see Hymn 596.\r\n\r\n\r\n600.

A Festal Anthem.\r\n\r\nA praise song celebrating the greatness and goodness of God as\r\nmanifested in all creation. The praise of God and of His marvelous works\r\nshall go on forever.

Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts\r\n\r\nKnown as the _Ter Sanctus_ or _Trisagion_. It is an anonymous 2d century\r\nreproduction of a Jewish synagogue “Doxology,” based on Isaiah 6:3:\r\n\r\n  And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of\r\n  hosts: the whole earth is full of the glory of God.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to be sung at the beginning of a worship service.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ SANCTUS. The composer of the tune, Alexander Samuel Cooper, was\r\nborn in London in 1835. The date of his death is not known. He was an\r\norganist and composer of anthems, chants, and hymn tunes, and edited\r\n_The Parochial Psalter_ and _The Parochial Chant Book_, both of which\r\nhave passed through numerous editions.\r\n\r\n\r\n602.

Hear our prayer, O Lord\r\n\r\nA response to be sung by choir or congregation or both after public\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nGeorge Whelpton, 1847-1930, composer of the tune, was born at Redbourne,\r\nEngland, but came to America with his parents when he was a child of\r\nfour years. He studied music under H. R. Palmer and with a private\r\nteacher in Boston. He became a well-known choir director in Buffalo and\r\nserved as editor of various publications. He died suddenly at Oxford,\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\n\r\n605. Thy word have I hid in my heart\r\n\r\nA response suitable for use in connection with the reading of the\r\nScriptures. The words are taken from Psalms 119:11, 12.\r\n\r\nNo biographical information regarding the composer, E. D. Beale, has\r\nbeen ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n606. Gloria Patri\r\n\r\nAn ancient canticle which is used in the service to give a trinitarian\r\nform to Old Testament unitarianism.\r\n\r\nThe first part, “Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy\r\nGhost,” was used very early in the apostolic era of the church, as the\r\ncommon doxology. The second part, “As it was in the beginning, is now,\r\nand ever shall be, world without end,” was added by the Western Church\r\nduring the second and third centuries when the Arian controversy raised\r\nthe question as to whether the God of the Old Testament is the same as\r\nthe God manifested in Christ in the New Testament. The answer,\r\nincorporated in the song, was an affirmative. It was always sung after\r\nthe Psalms to give them a New Testament or Trinitarian ending. This is\r\nstill the chief use of the Gloria Patri, though it is attached sometimes\r\nto some other part of the service. Concerning this point, Dr. Henry\r\nSloan Coffin says: “In view of the origin of the Gloria Patri and its\r\nlong historical association with the Psalms, it is vandalism to tear it\r\nfrom its proper context, and attach it to something else in the\r\nservice.” (_The Public Worship of God_, Westminster Press, p. 101).\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ For comments on Henry Greatorex see Hymn 230.\r\n\r\n\r\n607. Gloria Patri\r\n\r\nFor comments on the words see No. 606.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune was composed by Charles Meineke, 1782-1850, a German\r\npianist and organist who came to America in 1810. For a time he was\r\norganist at St. Paul’s Church, Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\n608. Let the words of my mouth\r\n\r\nFrom Psalm 19:14.\r\n\r\nPrayer, “uttered or unexpressed,” is a spiritual sacrifice. The sentence\r\nis used in the Jewish liturgy at the close of silent worship. If sung in\r\na quiet mood, the response is suitable for use by soloist, choir, or\r\ncongregation, before or after pastoral prayer of the worship service.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The music was composed by Adolph Baumbach, 1830-80, teacher of\r\npiano and organ and composer of instrumental and choir music. Baumbach\r\nwas born in Germany about 1830, came to America in 1855, and lived in\r\nBoston and Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n609. Father, O hear us\r\n\r\nAnonymous.\r\n\r\nSuitable for use as a response after prayer, or before a prayer of\r\nspecial petition, as in the case of Elijah in I Kings 18:37: “hear me, O\r\nLord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God.”\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune is attributed to Handel but the work from which it is\r\ntaken has not been identified.\r\n\r\nFor comments on George Frederick Handel see Hymn 73.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE LORD’S PRAYER\r\n\r\n\r\n610. Our Father, who art in heaven\r\n\r\nThe Lord’s Prayer, as found in Matthew 6:9-13.\r\n\r\nThe prayer which Christ taught the disciples is in its comprehensiveness\r\na pattern of prayer and may well be used in the prayers of the church.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The musical setting is from a Gregorian Chant. In singing it,\r\nthe following general directions for chanting may be found useful:\r\n\r\n1. Chants consist of two distinct divisions, one portion is recited, the\r\nother portion is sung.\r\n\r\n2. The words from the beginning of each line up to the accented word,\r\nwhich is printed in italics, are called the Recitation, and should be\r\nsung smoothly, without undue haste, and observing stops (,) as in good\r\nreading. The Recitation may be of any length. The note on which it is\r\nsung is called the Reciting note.\r\n\r\n3. On reaching the accented word and beginning with it, sing in strict\r\ntime. If there is no syllable after that which is accented, as, for\r\nexample, in “Thy Kingdom _come_,” the accented syllable is held for the\r\ntime value of one whole measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              OFFERTORIES\r\n\r\n\r\n611. Bless Thou the gifts our hands have brought    _Samuel Longfellow_,\r\n                                                                 1819-92\r\n\r\nAn offertory hymn to be sung by the choir or congregation or both.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the author, Samuel Longfellow, see Hymn 28.\r\n\r\nConcerning the place of the collection in the worship service, Henry\r\nSloan Coffin says in his excellent book on public worship:\r\n\r\n  Whether the collection be made in the middle of the service or near\r\n  its conclusion, it should be an act of worship. The gifts of the\r\n  people should be carried up to the holy table, and received and placed\r\n  upon it by the minister. While they are brought up, the congregation\r\n  may stand and sing a dedication, “All things come of Thee, O Lord, and\r\n  of thine own have we given Thee,” or a similar sentence. This may be\r\n  varied by using Ken’s familiar doxology, or a verse from an\r\n  appropriate hymn, such as Bishop How’s “We give Thee but Thine own.”\r\n  When the Offering is for a cause—missions or a hospital or the Bible\r\n  Society—a stanza from a hymn which fits the purpose may be selected\r\n  for use as the dedication and be printed on the order of worship in\r\n  the calendar. A minister may use a prayer in the act of dedication,\r\n  but it is difficult to find variety in its expression, and the prayer\r\n  should usually be comprised in a short sentence. Congregations are\r\n  helped to realize that in this act they are the offerers if they join\r\n  the choir in singing the dedication. (_The Public Worship of God_,\r\n  Westminster Press, 1946.) Quoted by permission.\r\n\r\nCANONBURY. For comments on this tune see Hymn 296.\r\n\r\n\r\n612. All things come of Thee, O Lord\r\n\r\nFrom 1 Chron. 29:14.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the mostly widely used offertory responses, usually sung\r\nby a congregation during the consecration of the offering.\r\n\r\nThe setting of the words is significant in its conception of the spirit\r\nof sacrifice and worship. David was assembling the material with which\r\nSolomon might build the temple. The people and leaders brought their\r\ngifts, all voluntarily, with no mention of a tithe or temple tax.\r\nGratitude for what God had done for them stirred their generosity and\r\nthey counted it a privilege to give back to God what came to them from\r\nHis hand.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The tune is an arrangement from Beethoven. The work from which\r\nit comes has not been identified.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Ludwig van Beethoven see Hymn 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BENEDICTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n613. May the grace of Christ our Savior         _John Newton_, 1725-1807\r\n\r\nA metrical version of the apostolic benediction in II Cor. 13:14: “The\r\ngrace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion\r\nof the Holy Spirit, be with you all.” The hymn has been translated into\r\nseveral languages. For more than 100 years the weekly meeting of the\r\nPresbyterian ministers in New York City closed with the singing of these\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ DORRNANCE first appeared in _The Choral_, 1845, by Isaac B.\r\nWoodbury and Benj. F. Baker.\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, Isaac B. Woodbury, see Hymn 261.\r\n\r\n\r\n614. The Lord bless you and keep you\r\n\r\nFrom the Authorized Version of the Aaronic blessing in Numbers 6:24-26,\r\nwith order of verses 25 and 26 reversed.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ The musical setting, the original of which has an elaborate\r\ncontrapuntal and sevenfold “Amen,” not suitable for congregational use,\r\nwas written as a farewell to William Smedley, choirmaster at the St.\r\nJames Protestant Episcopal Church, Chicago. Without Smedley’s knowledge\r\nthe congregation, all kneeling, sang this with great effect, after the\r\nbenediction, at the service of farewell.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Peter C. Lutkin see Hymn 390.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DOXOLOGIES\r\n\r\n\r\n615.

MICHAEL) is one of the greatest of short meter\r\ntunes, derived from the tune composed by L. Bourgeois for Psalm 101 in\r\nthe _Genevan Psalter_ of 1551. It has been set to a number of other\r\npsalms and hymns and appears at Hymn 128 set to “Ye servants of the\r\nLord” by Doddridge.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Louis Bourgeois see Hymn 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n617. Now to him who loved us, gave us            _Samuel Miller Waring_,\r\n                                                               1792-1827\r\n\r\nFrom the author’s _Sacred Melodies_, 1826, where it was followed by a\r\nsecond verse.\r\n\r\nSamuel Miller Waring, an Englishman, was brought up in the Society of\r\nFriends but left it to unite with the Church of England. He published\r\n_Sacred Melodies_ in 1826, in which his hymns appear.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ TRIUMPH appeared first in _The Church Hymn and Tune Book_,\r\n1852, edited by W. J. Blew and H. J.

Praise God from whom all blessings flow     _Thomas Ken_, 1637-1711\r\n\r\nThe most famous of all doxologies and the most frequently sung of all\r\nhymn stanzas.\r\n\r\nBishop Ken wrote three hymns, for morning, evening, and midnight, (See\r\nNos. 25 and 33), ending each with this stanza. The words are simple\r\nenough so a child can sing them with understanding, yet they are so\r\nprofound that the wisest and most prudent cannot exhaust their meaning.\r\n\r\nFor comments on Thomas Ken see Hymn 25.\r\n\r\n_MUSIC._ OLD HUNDREDTH.

Dresden Amen\r\n\r\nA cadence, or ending, much used in ecclesiastical music in the Royal\r\nChapel of Dresden (common also throughout Saxony). Wagner immortalized\r\nit in his _Parsifal_ and the tune also appears in Mendelssohn’s\r\n_Reformation Symphony_, Stanford’s _Service in B flat_, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe composer, Johann Gottlieb Naumann (or Giovanni Amadeo), 1741-1801,\r\nwell-known musician in his day, was born at Blasewitz, near Dresden, the\r\nson of peasant parents. He was a successful opera composer in Saxony,\r\nItaly, Sweden, and Prussia. Naumann was also a prolific composer of\r\nchurch music: 13 oratorios, 21 masses with _Te Deums_, and smaller\r\nchurch pieces. Some of his compositions are still in use. His best known\r\nsingle work known beyond Dresden is his setting of Klopstock’s _Vater\r\nunser_.\r\n\r\n\r\n620. Threefold Amen\r\n\r\nThe tune is from an unknown Danish source and has wide use in the\r\nLutheran churches of Denmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n621. Amen Sequence\r\n\r\nAn effective piece for women’s voices, of unknown origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n622. Fourfold Amen\r\n\r\nFor comments on the composer, John Stainer, see Hymn 111.\r\n\r\n\r\n623. Sevenfold Amen\r\n\r\nFirst appeared in _A Choir-book for the Office of Holy Communion_, 1873,\r\nedited by Stainer.\r\n\r\nFor comments on John Stainer see Hymn 111.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NOTE ON THE USE OF “AMEN”\r\n\r\nIn the Jewish and early Christian Church, the people said “Amen” after\r\nprayers were offered. Cf. I Cor. 14:16. In so doing, they gave a\r\ndeliberate endorsement to what had been said or sung. The “Amen,”\r\nmeaning “so be it,” should be sung with conviction, not thoughtlessly or\r\nhalf-heartedly, as if what went before is of doubtful importance.\r\n\r\nThe settings given here are principally for use by the choir after the\r\npastoral prayer or at the close of a service, in churches where such\r\nmusical elaboration is practiced.\r\n\r\nThe use of “Amen” after a hymn is optional. If sung well, it serves as a\r\nsatisfying concluding formula. Its use is entirely appropriate only with\r\nthose hymns which are prayer, praise, or otherwise addressed to God.\r\n\r\nThe first instance of its use at the end of a hymn is in a curious hymn\r\nbook entitled, _Seven Sobs of a Sorrowful Soul for Sinne_, published in\r\nEngland in 1583. During the last century most editors of hymnals have\r\nadopted the custom of adding the “Amen” to all hymns. The _Songs of\r\nPraise_, published in England in 1933, is a notable exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PRINCIPAL WORKS CONSULTED\r\n\r\n\r\n                                General\r\n\r\n  Benson, Louis F., _Studies of Familiar Hymns_.
