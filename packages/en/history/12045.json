The stories\r\nof many of these women have been written with more or less detail, while\r\nof others we know little more than their names and the titles of a few of\r\ntheir works; but even our scanty knowledge of them is of value.\r\n\r\nOf the army of women artists of the last century it is not yet possible\r\nto speak with judgment and justice, although many have executed works of\r\nwhich all women may be proud.\r\n\r\nWe have some knowledge of women artists in ancient days. Few stories of\r\nthat time are so authentic as that of Kora, who made the design for the\r\nfirst bas-relief, in the city of Sicyonia, in the seventh century B. C.\r\nWe have the names of other Greek women artists of the centuries\r\nimmediately preceding and following the Christian era, but we know little\r\nof their lives and works.\r\n\r\nCalypso was famous for the excellence of her character pictures, a\r\nremarkable one being a portrait of Theodorus, the Juggler. A picture\r\nfound at Pompeii, now at Naples, is attributed to this artist; but its\r\nauthorship is so uncertain that little importance can be attached to it.\r\nPliny praised Eirene, among whose pictures was one of \"An Aged Man\" and a\r\nportrait of \"Alcisthenes, the Dancer.\"\r\n\r\nIn the annals of Roman Art we find few names of women. For this reason\r\nLaya, who lived about a century before the Christian era, is important.\r\nShe is honored as the original painter of miniatures, and her works on\r\nivory were greatly esteemed. Pliny says she did not marry, but pursued\r\nher art with absolute devotion; and he considered her pictures worthy of\r\ngreat praise.\r\n\r\nA large picture in Naples is said to be the work of Laya, but, as in the\r\ncase of Calypso, we have no assurance that it is genuine. It is also said\r\nthat Laya's portraits commanded larger prices than those of Sopolis and\r\nDyonisius, the most celebrated portrait painters of their time.\r\n\r\nOur scanty knowledge of individual women artists of antiquity--mingled\r\nwith fable as it doubtless is--serves the important purpose of proving\r\nthat women, from very ancient times, were educated as artists and\r\ncreditably followed their profession beside men of the same periods.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge also awakens imagination, and we wonder in what other\r\nancient countries there were women artists. We know that in Egypt\r\ninheritances descended in the female line, as in the case of the Princess\r\nKaramat; and since we know of the great architectural works of Queen\r\nHashop and her journey to the land of Punt, we may reasonably assume that\r\nthe women of ancient Egypt had their share in all the interests of life.\r\nWere there not artists among them who decorated temples and tombs with\r\ntheir imperishable colors? Did not women paint those pictures of\r\nIsis--goddess of Sothis--that are like precursors of the pictures of the\r\nImmaculate Conception? Surely we may hope that a papyrus will be brought\r\nto light that will reveal to us the part that women had in the decoration\r\nof the monuments of ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nAt present we have no reliable records of the lives and works of women\r\nartists before the time of the Renaissance in Italy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. Taine's philosophy which regards the art of any people or period as\r\nthe necessary result of the conditions of race, religion, civilization,\r\nand manners in the midst of which the art was produced--and esteems a\r\nknowledge of these conditions as sufficient to account for the character\r\nof the art, seems to me to exclude many complex and mysterious\r\ninfluences, especially in individual cases, which must affect the work of\r\nthe artists. At the same time an intelligent study of the art of any\r\nnation or period demands a study of the conditions in which it was\r\nproduced, and I shall endeavor in this _résumé_ of the history of women\r\nin Art--mere outline as it is--to give an idea of the atmosphere in which\r\nthey lived and worked, and the influences which affected the results of\r\ntheir labor.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that everything of importance that originated in\r\nItaly from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century bore the distinctive\r\nmark of Fine Art. So high an authority as John Addington Symonds is in\r\naccord with this view, and the study of these four centuries is of\r\nabsorbing interest.\r\n\r\nAlthough the thirteenth century long preceded the practice of art by\r\nwomen, its influence was a factor in the artistic life into which they\r\nlater came. In this century Andrea Tan, Guido da Siena, and other devoted\r\nsouls were involved in the final struggles of Mediaeval Art, and at its\r\nclose Cimabue and Duccio da Siena--the two masters whose Madonnas were\r\nborne in solemn procession through the streets of Florence and Siena, mid\r\nmusic and the pealing of bells--had given the new impulse to painting\r\nwhich brought them immortal fame. They were the heralds of the time when\r\npoetry of sentiment, beauty of color, animation and individuality of form\r\nshould replace Mediaeval formality and ugliness; a time when the spirit of\r\nart should be revived with an impulse prophetic of its coming glory.\r\n\r\nBut neither this portentous period nor the fourteenth century is\r\nmemorable in the annals of women artists. Not until the fifteenth, the\r\ncentury of the full Renaissance, have we a record of their share in the\r\ngreat rebirth.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that the art of the Renaissance had, in the\r\nbeginning, a distinct office to fill in the service of the Church. Later,\r\nin historical and decorative painting, it served the State, and at\r\nlength, in portrait and landscape painting, in pictures of genre subjects\r\nand still-life, abundant opportunity was afforded for all orders of\r\ntalent, and the generous patronage of art by church, state, and men of\r\nrank and wealth, made Italy a veritable paradise for artists.\r\n\r\nGradually, with the revival of learning, artists were free to give\r\ngreater importance to secular subjects, and an element of worldliness,\r\nand even of immorality, invaded the realm of art as it invaded the realms\r\nof life and literature.\r\n\r\nThis was an era of change in all departments of life. Chivalry, the great\r\n\"poetic lie,\" died with feudalism, and the relations between men and\r\nwomen became more natural and reasonable than in the preceding centuries.\r\nWomen were liberated from the narrow sphere to which they had been\r\nrelegated in the minstrel's song and poet's rhapsody, but as yet neither\r\ntime nor opportunity had been given them for the study and development\r\nwhich must precede noteworthy achievement.\r\n\r\nRemarkable as was the fifteenth century for intellectual and artistic\r\nactivity, it was not productive in its early decades of great genius in\r\nart or letters. Its marvellous importance was apparent only at its close\r\nand in the beginning of the sixteenth century, when the works of\r\nLeonardo, Michael Angelo, Raphael, Titian, and their followers emphasized\r\nthe value of the progressive attainments of their predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe assertion and contradiction of ideas and theories, the rivalries of\r\ndiffering schools, the sweet devotion of Fra Angelico, the innovations of\r\nMasolino and Masaccio, the theory of perspective of Paolo Uccello, the\r\nvaried works of Fabriano, Antonello da Messina, the Lippi, Botticelli,\r\nGhirlandajo, the Bellini, and their contemporaries, culminated in the\r\ninimitable painting of the Cinquecento--in works still unsurpassed, ever\r\nchallenging artists of later centuries to the task of equalling or\r\nexcelling them.\r\n\r\nThe demands of the art of the Renaissance were so great, and so unlike\r\nthose of earlier days, that it is not surprising that few women, in its\r\nbeginning, attained to such excellence as to be remembered during five\r\ncenturies. Especially would it seem that an insurmountable obstacle had\r\nbeen placed in the way of women, since the study of anatomy had become a\r\nnecessity to an artist. This, and kindred hindrances, too patent to\r\nrequire enumeration, account for the fact that but two Italian women of\r\nthis period became so famous as to merit notice--Caterina Vigri and\r\nOnorata Rodiana, whose stories are given in the biographical part of this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Flanders, late in the fourteenth and early in the fifteenth centuries,\r\nwomen were engaged in the study and practice of art. In Bruges, when the\r\nVan Eycks were inventing new methods in the preparation of colors, and\r\npainting their wonderful pictures, beside them, and scarcely inferior to\r\nthem, was their sister, Margaretha, who sacrificed much of her artistic\r\nfame by painting portions of her brothers' pictures, unless the fact that\r\nthey thought her worthy of thus assisting them establishes her reputation\r\nbeyond question.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century we have reason to believe that many women\r\npractised art in various departments, but so scanty and imperfect are the\r\nrecords of individual artists that little more than their names are\r\nknown, and we have no absolute knowledge of the value of their works, or\r\nwhere, if still existing, they are to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe art of the Renaissance reached its greatest excellence during the\r\nlast three decades of the fifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. This was a glorious period in the History of Art. The barbarism\r\nof the Middle Ages was essentially a thing of the past, but much barbaric\r\nsplendor in the celebration of ceremonies and festivals still remained to\r\nsatisfy the artistic sense, while every-day costumes and customs lent a\r\npicturesqueness to ordinary life. So much of the pagan spirit as endured\r\nwas modified by the spirit of the Renaissance. The result was a new order\r\nof things especially favorable to painting.\r\n\r\nAn artist now felt himself as free to illustrate the pagan myths as to\r\nrepresent the events in the lives of the Saviour, the Virgin and the\r\nsaints, and the actors in the sacred subjects were represented with the\r\nsame beauty and grace of form as were given the heroes and heroines of\r\nHellenic legend. St. Sebastian was as beautiful as Apollo, and the\r\nimagination and senses were moved alike by pictures of Danae and the\r\nMagdalene--the two subjects being often the work of the same artist.\r\n\r\nThe human form was now esteemed as something more than the mere\r\nhabitation of a soul; it was beautiful in itself and capable of awakening\r\nunnumbered emotions in the human heart. Nature, too, presented herself in\r\na new aspect and inspired the artist with an ardor in her representation\r\nsuch as few of the older painters had experienced in their devotion to\r\nreligious subjects.\r\n\r\nThis expansion of thought and purpose was inaugurating an art attractive\r\nto women, to which the increasing liberty of artistic theory and\r\npractice must logically make them welcome; a result which is a\r\ndistinguishing feature of sixteenth-century painting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century was noteworthy for the generous patronage of art,\r\nespecially in Florence, where the policy of its ruling house could not\r\nfail to produce marvellous results, and the history of the Medici\r\ndiscloses many reasons why the bud of the Renaissance perfected its bloom\r\nin Florence more rapidly and more gloriously than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFor centuries Italy had been a treasure-house of Greek, Etruscan, and\r\nByzantine Art. In no other country had a civilization like that of\r\nancient Rome existed, and no other land had been so richly prepared to be\r\nthe birthplace and to promote the development of the art of the\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\nThe intellectually progressive life of this period did much for the\r\nadvancement of women. The fame of Vittoria Colonna, Tullia d'Aragona,\r\nOlympia Morata, and many others who merit association in this goodly\r\ncompany, proves the generous spirit of the age, when in the scholastic\r\ncentres of Italy women were free to study all branches of learning.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of art was equally open to them and women were pupils in all\r\nthe schools and in the studios of many masters; even Titian instructed a\r\nwoman, and all the advantages for study enjoyed by men were equally\r\navailable for women. Many names of Italian women artists could be added\r\nto those of whom I have written in the biographical portion of this\r\nbook, but too little is known of their lives and works to be of present\r\ninterest. There is, however, little doubt that many pictures attributed\r\nto \"the School of\" various masters were painted by women.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArt did not reach its perfection in Venice until later than in Florence,\r\nand its special contribution, its glorious color, imparted to it an\r\nattraction unequalled on the sensuous plane. This color surrounded the\r\nartists of that sumptuous city of luxurious life and wondrous pageants,\r\nand was so emphasized by the marvellous mingling of the semi-mist and the\r\nbrilliancy of its atmosphere that no man who merited the name of artist\r\ncould be insensible to its inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe old Venetian realism was followed, in the time of the Renaissance, by\r\nstartling developments. In the works of Tintoretto and Veronese there is\r\na combination of gorgeous draperies, splendid and often licentious\r\ncostumes, brilliant metal accessories, and every possible device for\r\nenhancing and contrasting colors, until one is bewildered and must adjust\r\nhimself to these dazzling spectacles--religious subjects though they may\r\nbe--before any serious thought or judgment can be brought to bear upon\r\ntheir artistic merit; these two great contemporaries lived and worked in\r\nthe final decades of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nWe know that many women painted pictures in Venice before the seventeenth\r\ncentury, although we have accurate knowledge of but few, and of these an\r\naccount is given later in this book.\r\n\r\nWe who go from Paris to London in a few hours, and cross the St. Gothard\r\nin a day, can scarcely realize the distance that separated these capitals\r\nfrom the centres of Italian art in the time of the Renaissance. We have,\r\nhowever, abundant proof that the sacred fire of the love of Art and\r\nLetters was smouldering in France, Germany, and England--and when the\r\ninspiring breath of the Renaissance was wafted beyond the Alps a flame\r\nburst forth which has burned clearer and brighter with succeeding\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Vincent de Beauvais, who died in 1264, France had not\r\nbeen wanting in illustrious scholars, but it could not be said that a\r\nFrench school of art existed. François Clouet or Cloet, called Jehannet,\r\nwas born in Tours about 1500. His portraits are seen in the Gallery of\r\nthe Louvre, and have been likened to those of Holbein; but they lack the\r\nstrength and spirit of that artist; in fact, the distinguishing feature\r\nof Clouet's work is the remarkable finish of draperies and accessories,\r\nwhile the profusion of jewels distracts attention from the heads of his\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nThe first great French artists were of the seventeenth century, and\r\nalthough Clouet was painter to Francis I. and Henry II., the former, like\r\nhis predecessors, imported artists from Italy, among whom were Leonardo\r\nda Vinci and Benvenuto Cellini.\r\n\r\nIn letters, however, there were French women of the sixteenth century who\r\nare still famous. Marguerite de Valois was as cultivated in mind as she\r\nwas generous and noble in character. Her love of learning was not easily\r\nsatisfied. She was proficient in Hebrew, the classics, and the usual\r\nbranches of \"profane letters,\" as well as an accomplished scholar in\r\nphilosophy and theology. As an author--though her writings are somewhat\r\nvoluminous and not without merit--she was comparatively unimportant; her\r\ngreat service to letters was the result of the sympathy and encouragement\r\nshe gave to others.\r\n\r\nWherever she might be, she was the centre of a literary and religious\r\ncircle, as well as of the society in which she moved. She was in full\r\nsympathy with her brother in making his \"_Collège_\" an institution in\r\nwhich greater liberty was accorded to the expression of individual\r\nopinion than had before been known in France, and by reason of her\r\nprotection of liberty in thought and speech she suffered much in the\r\nesteem of the bigots of her day.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Mlle. de Heilly--the Duchesse d'Etampes--whose influence\r\nover Francis I. was pre-eminent, while her character was totally unlike\r\nthat of his sister, was described as \"the fairest among the learned, and\r\nthe most learned among the fair.\" When learning was thus in favor at\r\nCourt, it naturally followed that all capacity for it was cultivated and\r\nordinary intelligence made the most of; and the claim that the\r\nintellectual brilliancy of the women of the Court of Francis I. has\r\nrarely been equalled is generally admitted. There were, however, no\r\nartists among them--they wielded the pen rather than the brush.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn England, as in France, there was no native school of art in the\r\nsixteenth century, and Flemish, Dutch, and German artists crossed the\r\nchannel when summoned to the English Court, as the Italians crossed the\r\nAlps to serve the kings of France.\r\n\r\nEnglish women of this century were far less scholarly than those of Italy\r\nand France. At the same time they might well be proud of a queen who\r\n\"could quote Pindar and Homer in the original and read every morning a\r\nportion of Demosthenes, being also the royal mistress of eight\r\nlanguages.\" With our knowledge of the queen's scholarship in mind we\r\nmight look to her for such patronage of art and literature as would rival\r\nthat of Lorenzo the Magnificent; but Elizabeth lacked the generosity of\r\nthe Medici and that of Marguerite de Valois. Hume tells us that \"the\r\nqueen's vanity lay more in shining by her own learning than in\r\nencouraging men of genius by her liberality.\"\r\n\r\nLady Jane Grey and the daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke are familiar\r\nexamples of learned women, and many English titled and gentlewomen were\r\nwell versed in Greek and Latin, as well as in Spanish, Italian, and\r\nFrench. Macaulay reminded his readers that if an Englishwoman of that day\r\ndid not read the classics she could read little, since the then existing\r\nbooks--outside the Italian--would fill a shelf but scantily. Thus English\r\ngirls read Plato, and doubtless English women excelled Englishmen in\r\ntheir proficiency in foreign languages, as they do at present.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Germany the relative position of Art and Letters was the opposite to\r\nthat in France and England. The School of Cologne was a genuinely native\r\nschool of art in the fourteenth century. Although the Niebelungen Lied\r\nand Gudrun, the Songs of Love and Volkslieder, as well as Mysteries and\r\nPassion Plays, existed from an early date, we can scarcely speak of a\r\nGerman Literature before the sixteenth century, when Albert Dürer and the\r\nyounger Holbein painted their great pictures, while Luther, Melanchthon\r\nand their sympathizers disseminated the doctrines of advancing\r\nProtestantism.\r\n\r\nAt this period, in the countries we may speak of collectively as German,\r\nwomen artists were numerous. Many were miniaturists, some of whom were\r\ninvited to the English Court and received with honor.\r\n\r\nIn 1521 Albert Dürer was astonished at the number of women artists in\r\ndifferent parts of what, for conciseness, we may call Germany. This was\r\nalso noticeable in Holland, and Dürer wrote in his diary, in the\r\nabove-named year: \"Master Gerard, of Antwerp, illuminist, has a daughter,\r\neighteen years of age, named Susannah, who illuminated a little book\r\nwhich I purchased for a few guilders. It is wonderful that a woman could\r\ndo so much!\"\r\n\r\nAntwerp became famous for its women artists, some of whom visited France,\r\nItaly, and Spain, and were honorably recognized for their talent and\r\nattainments, wherever they went.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the later years of the sixteenth century a difference of opinion and\r\npurpose arose among the artists of Italy, the effects of which were shown\r\nin the art of the seventeenth century. Two distinct schools were formed,\r\none of which included the conservatives who desired to preserve and\r\nfollow the manner of the masters of the Cinquecento, at the same time\r\nmaking a deeper study of Nature--thus the devotional feeling and many of\r\nthe older traditions would be retained while each master could indulge\r\nhis individuality more freely than heretofore. They aimed to unite such a\r\nstyle as Correggio's--who belonged to no school--with that of the\r\nseverely mannered artists of the preceding centuries. These artists were\r\ncalled Eclectics, and the Bolognese school of the Carracci was the most\r\nimportant centre of the movement, while Domenichino, a native of\r\nBologna--1581-1631--was the most distinguished painter of the school.\r\n\r\nThe original aims of the Eclectics are well summed up in a sonnet by\r\nAgostino Carracci, which has been translated as follows: \"Let him who\r\nwishes to be a good painter acquire the design of Rome, Venetian action\r\nand Venetian management of shade, the dignified color of Lombardy--that\r\nis of Leonardo da Vinci--the terrible manner of Michael Angelo, Titian's\r\ntruth and nature, the sovereign purity of Correggio's style and the just\r\nsymmetry of a Raphael, the decorum and well-grounded study of Tibaldi,\r\nthe invention of the learned Primaticcio, and a _little_ of\r\nParmigianino's grace; but without so much study and weary labor let him\r\napply himself to imitate the works which our Niccolò--dell Abbate--left\r\nus here.\" Kugler calls this \"a patchwork ideal,\" which puts the matter in\r\na nut-shell.\r\n\r\nAt one period the Eclectics produced harmonious pictures in a manner\r\nattractive to women, many of whom studied under Domenichino, Giovanni\r\nLanfranco, Guido Reni, the Campi, and others. Sofonisba Anguisciola,\r\nElisabetta Sirani, and the numerous women artists of Bologna were of this\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe greatest excellence of this art was of short duration; it declined as\r\ndid the literature, and indeed, the sacred and political institutions of\r\nItaly in the seventeenth century. It should not, however, be forgotten,\r\nthat the best works of Guercino, the later pictures of Annibale Carracci,\r\nand the important works of Domenichino and Salvator Rosa belong to this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe second school was that of the Naturalists, who professed to study\r\nNature alone, representing with brutal realism her repulsive aspects.\r\nNaples was the centre of these painters, and the poisoning of Domenichino\r\nand many other dark and terrible deeds have been attributed to them. Few\r\nwomen were attracted to this school, and the only one whose association\r\nwith the Naturalisti is recorded--Aniella di Rosa--paid for her temerity\r\nwith her life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Rome, Florence, Bologna, Venice, and other Italian cities, there were,\r\nin the seventeenth century, many women who made enviable reputations as\r\nartists, some of whom were also known for their literary and musical\r\nattainments. Anna Maria Ardoina, of Messina, made her studies in Rome.\r\nShe was gifted as a poet and artist, and so excelled in music that she\r\nhad the distinguished honor of being elected to the Academy of Arcadia.\r\n\r\nNot a few gifted women of this time are remembered for their noble\r\ncharities. Chiara Varotari, under the instruction of her father and her\r\nbrother, called Padovanino, became a good painter. She was also honored\r\nas a skilful nurse, and the Grand Duke of Tuscany placed her portrait in\r\nhis gallery on account of his admiration and respect for her as a\r\ncomforter of the suffering.\r\n\r\nGiovanna Garzoni, a miniaturist, conferred such benefits upon the Academy\r\nof St. Luke that a monument was there erected to her memory. Other\r\nartists founded convents, became nuns, and imprinted themselves upon\r\ntheir age in connection with various honorable institutions and\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrench Art in the seventeenth century was academic and prosaic, lacking\r\nthe spontaneity, joyousness, and intensely artistic feeling of Italian\r\nArt--a heritage from previous centuries which had not been lost, and in\r\nwhich France had no part. The works of Poussin, which have been likened\r\nto painted reliefs, afford an excellent example of French Art in his\r\ntime--1594-1665--and this in spite of the fact that he worked and studied\r\nmuch in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Académie des Beaux-Arts was established by Louis XIV., and there was\r\na rapidly growing interest in art. As yet, however, the women of France\r\naffected literature rather than painting, and in the seventeenth century\r\nthey were remarkable for their scholarly attainments and their influence\r\nin the world of letters.\r\n\r\nMadame de Maintenon patronized learning; at the Hôtel Rambouillet men and\r\nwomen of genius met the world of rank and fashion on common ground.\r\nMadame Dacier, of whom Voltaire said, \"No woman has ever rendered greater\r\nservices to literature,\" made her translations from the classics; Madame\r\nde Sevigné wrote her marvellous letters; Mademoiselle de Scudéry and\r\nMadame Lafayette their novels; Catherine Bernard emulated the manner of\r\nRacine in her dramas; while Madame de Guyon interpreted the mystic Song\r\nof Solomon.\r\n\r\nOf French women artists of this period we can mention several names, but\r\nthey were so overshadowed by authors as to be unimportant, unless, like\r\nElizabeth Chéron, they won both artistic and literary fame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century was an age of excellence in the art of Flanders,\r\nBelgium, and Holland, and is known as the second great epoch of painting\r\nin the Netherlands, this name including the three countries just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nAfter the calamities suffered under Charles V. and Philip II., with\r\nreturning peace and prosperity an art was developed, both original and\r\nrich in artistic power. The States-General met in 1600, and the greatest\r\nartists of the Netherlands did their work in the succeeding fifty years;\r\nand before the century closed the appreciation of art and the patronage\r\nwhich had assured its elevation were things of the past.\r\n\r\nRubens was twenty-three years old in 1600, just ready to begin his work\r\nwhich raised the school of Belgium to its highest attainments. When we\r\nremember how essentially his art dominated his own country and was\r\nadmired elsewhere, we might think--I had almost said fear--that his\r\nbrilliant, vigorous, and voluptuous manner would attract all artists of\r\nhis day to essay his imitation. But among women artists Madame O'Connell\r\nwas the first who could justly be called his imitator, and her work was\r\ndone in the middle of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the genre painting of the Flemish and Dutch artists we\r\nfind that they represented scenes in the lives of coarse, drunken boors\r\nand vulgar women--works which brought these artists enduring fame by\r\nreason of their wonderful technique; but we can mention one woman only,\r\nAnna Breughel, who seriously attempted the practice of this art. She is\r\nthought to have been of the family of Velvet Breughel, who lived in the\r\nearly part of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nLike Rubens, Rembrandt numbered few women among his imitators. The women\r\nof his day and country affected pleasing delineations of superficial\r\nmotives, and Rembrandt's earnestness and intensity were seemingly above\r\ntheir appreciation--certainly far above their artistic powers.\r\n\r\nA little later so many women painted delicate and insipid subjects that I\r\nhave not space even for their names. A critic has said that the Dutch\r\nschool \"became a nursery for female talent.\" It may have reached the\r\nKindergarten stage, but went no farther.\r\n\r\nFlower painting attained great excellence in the seventeenth century. The\r\nmost elaborate masters in this art were the brothers De Heem, Willem\r\nKalf, Abraham Mignon, and Jan van Huysum. Exquisite as the pictures by\r\nthese masters are, Maria van Oosterwyck and Rachel Ruysch disputed\r\nhonors with them, and many other women excelled in this delightful art.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature in art at this time was the intimate association\r\nof men and women artists and the distinction of women thus associated.\r\n\r\nGerard Terburg, whose pictures now have an enormous value, had two\r\nsisters, Maria and Gezina, whose genre pictures were not unworthy of\r\ncomparison with the works of their famous brother. Gottfried Schalken,\r\nremarkable for his skill in the representation of scenes by candle light,\r\nwas scarcely more famous than his sister Maria. Eglon van der Neer is\r\nfamous for his pictures of elegant women in marvellous satin gowns. He\r\nmarried Adriana Spilberg, a favorite portrait painter. The daughters of\r\nthe eminent engraver Cornelius Visscher, Anna and Maria, were celebrated\r\nfor their fine etching on glass, and by reason of their poems and their\r\nscholarly acquirements they were called the \"Dutch Muses,\" and were\r\nassociated with the learned men of their day. This list, though\r\nincomplete, suggests that the co-education of artists bore good fruit in\r\ntheir co-operation in their profession.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn England, while there was a growing interest in painting, the standard\r\nwas that of foreign schools, especially the Dutch. Foreign artists found\r\na welcome and generous patronage at the English Court. Mary Beale and\r\nAnne Carlisle are spoken of as English artists, and a few English women\r\nwere miniaturists. Among these was Susannah Penelope Gibson, daughter of\r\nRichard Gibson, the Dwarf. While these women were not wanting in\r\nartistic taste, they were little more than copyists of the Dutch artists\r\nwith whom they had associated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the seventeenth century there were a number of\r\nDanish women who were painters, engravers, and modellers in wax. The\r\ndaughter of King Christian IV., Elenora Christina, and her daughter,\r\nHelena Christina, were reputable artists. The daughter of Christian V.,\r\nSophie Hedwig, made a reputation as a portrait, landscape, and flower\r\npainter, which extended beyond her own country; and Anna Crabbe painted a\r\nseries of portraits of Danish princes, and added to them descriptive\r\nverses of her own composition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Art of Spain attained its greatest glory in the seventeenth\r\ncentury--the century of Velasquez, Murillo, Ribera, and other less\r\ndistinguished but excellent artists.\r\n\r\nIn the last half of this century women artists were prominent in the\r\nannals of many Spanish cities. In the South mention is made of these\r\nartists, who were of excellent position and aristocratic connection. In\r\nValencia, the daughter of the great portrait painter Alonzo Coello was\r\ndistinguished in both painting and music. She married Don Francesco de\r\nHerrara, Knight of Santiago.\r\n\r\nIn Cordova the sister of Palomino y Vasco--the artist who has been called\r\nthe Vasari of Spain on account of his Museo Pictorio--was recognized as a\r\ntalented artist. In Madrid, Velasquez numbered several noble ladies among\r\nhis pupils; but no detailed accounts of the works of these artists is\r\navailable--if any such exist--and their pictures are in private\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe above outline of the general conditions of Art in the seventeenth\r\ncentury will suggest the reasons for there being a larger number of women\r\nartists in Italy than elsewhere--especially as they were pupils in the\r\nstudios of the best masters as well as in the schools of the Carracci and\r\nother centres of art study.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nItalian artists of the eighteenth century have been called scene\r\npainters, and, in truth, many of their works impress one as hurried\r\nattempts to cover large spaces. Originality was wanting and a wearisome\r\nmediocrity prevailed. At the same time certain national artistic\r\nqualities were apparent; good arrangement of figures and admirable\r\neffects of color still characterized Italian painting, but the result\r\nwas, on the whole, academic and uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe ideals cherished by older artists were lost, and nothing worthy to\r\nreplace them inspired their followers. The sincerity, earnestness, and\r\ndevotion of the men who served church and state in the decoration of\r\nsplendid monuments would have been out of place in the service of\r\namateurs and in the decoration of the salons and boudoirs of the rich,\r\nand the painting of this period had little permanent value, in comparison\r\nwith that of preceding centuries.\r\n\r\nItalian women, especially in the second half of the century, were\r\nprofessors in universities, lectured to large audiences, and were\r\nrespectfully consulted by men of science and learning in the various\r\nbranches of scholarship to which they were devoted. Unusual honors were\r\npaid them, as in the case of Maria Portia Vignoli, to whom a statue was\r\nerected in the public square of Viterbo to commemorate her great learning\r\nin natural science.\r\n\r\nAn artist, Matilda Festa, held a professorship in the Academy of St. Luke\r\nin Rome, and Maria Maratti, daughter of the Roman painter Carlo Maratti,\r\nmade a good reputation both as an artist and a poetess.\r\n\r\nIn Northern Italy many women were famous in sculpture, painting, and\r\nengraving. At least forty could be named, artists of good repute, whose\r\nlives were lacking in any unusual interest, and whose works are in\r\nprivate collections. One of these was a princess of Parma, who married\r\nthe Archduke Joseph of Austria, and was elected to the Academy of Vienna\r\nin 1789.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn France, in the beginning of this century Watteau, 1684-1721, painted\r\nhis interesting pictures of _La Belle Société_, reproducing the court\r\nlife, costumes, and manners of the reign of Louis XIV. with fidelity,\r\ngrace, and vivacity. Later in the century, Greuze, 1725-1805, with his\r\nattractive, refined, and somewhat mannered style, had a certain\r\ninfluence. Claude Vernet, 1714-1789, and David, 1748-1825, each great in\r\nhis way, influenced the nineteenth as well as the eighteenth century.\r\nThough Vien, 1716-1809, made a great effort to revive classic art, he\r\nfound little sympathy with his aim until the works of his pupil David\r\nwon recognition from the world of the First Empire.\r\n\r\nFrench Art of this period may be described by a single\r\nword--eclectic--and this choice by each important artist of the style he\r\nwould adopt culminated in the Rococo School, which may be defined as the\r\nunusual and fantastic in art. It was characterized by good technique and\r\npleasing color, but lacked purpose, depth, and warmth of feeling. As\r\nusual in a _pot-pourri_, it was far enough above worthlessness not to be\r\nignored, but so far short of excellence as not to be admired.\r\n\r\nIn France during this century there was an army of women artists,\r\npainters, sculptors, and engravers. Of a great number we know the names\r\nonly; in fact, of but two of these, Adelaide Vincent and Elizabeth Vigée\r\nLe Brun, have we reliable knowledge of their lives and works.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century is important in the annals of women artists, since\r\ntheir numbers then exceeded the collective number of those who had\r\npreceded them--so far as is known--from the earliest period in the\r\nhistory of art. In a critical review of the time, however, we find a\r\ngeneral and active interest in culture and art among women rather than\r\nany considerable number of noteworthy artists.\r\n\r\nGermany was the scene of the greatest activity of women artists. France\r\nheld the second place and Italy the third, thus reversing the conditions\r\nof preceding centuries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany German women emulated the examples of the earlier flower painters,\r\nbut no one was so important as to merit special attention, though a\r\ngoodly number were elected to academies and several appointed painters to\r\nthe minor courts.\r\n\r\nAmong the genre and historical painters we find the names of Anna Amalia\r\nof Brunswick and Anna Maria, daughter of the Empress Maria Theresa, both\r\nof whom were successful artists.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin and Dresden the interest in art was much greater in the\r\neighteenth than in previous centuries, and with this new impulse many\r\nwomen devoted themselves to various specialties in art. Miniature and\r\nenamel painting were much in vogue, and collections of these works, now\r\nseen in museums and private galleries, are exquisitely beautiful and\r\nchallenge our admiration, not only for their beauty, but for the delicacy\r\nof their handling and the infinite patience demanded for their execution.\r\n\r\nThe making of medals was carried to great excellence by German women, as\r\nmay be seen in a medal of Queen Sophie Charlotte, which is preserved in\r\nthe royal collection of medals. It is the work of Rosa Elizabeth\r\nSchwindel, of Leipsic, who was well known in Berlin in the beginning of\r\nthe century.\r\n\r\nThe cutting of gems was also extensively done by women. Susannah Dorsch\r\nwas famous for her accomplishment in this art. Her father and grandfather\r\nhad been gem-cutters, and Susannah could not remember at what age she\r\nbegan this work. So highly was she esteemed as an artist that medals were\r\nmade in her honor.\r\n\r\nAs frequently happens in a study of this kind, I find long lists of the\r\nnames of women artists of this period of whose lives and works I find no\r\nrecord, while the events related in other cases are too trivial for\r\nrepetition. This is especially true in Holland, where we find many names\r\nof Dutch women who must have been reputable artists, since they are\r\nmentioned in Art Chronicles of their time; but we know little of their\r\nlives and can mention no pictures executed by them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA national art now existed in England. Hogarth, who has been called the\r\nFather of English Painting, was a man of too much originality to be a\r\nmere imitator of foreign artists. He devoted his art to the\r\nrepresentation of the follies of his time. As a satirist he was eminent,\r\nbut his mirth-provoking pictures had a deeper purpose than that of\r\namusing. Lord Orford wrote: \"Mirth colored his pictures, but benevolence\r\ndesigned them. He smiled like Socrates, that men might not be offended at\r\nhis lectures, and might learn to laugh at their own folly.\"\r\n\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough were born and died in the\r\neighteenth century; their famous works were contemporary with the\r\nfounding of the Royal Academy in 1768, when these artists, together with\r\nAngelica Kauffman and Mary Moser, were among its original members.\r\n\r\nIt was a fashion in England at this time for women to paint; they\r\nprincipally affected miniature and water-color pictures, but of the many\r\nwho called themselves artists few merit our attention; they practised but\r\na feeble sort of imitative painting; their works of slight importance\r\ncannot now be named, while their lives were usually commonplace and void\r\nof incident. Of the few exceptions to this rule I have written in the\r\nlater pages of this book.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that the nineteenth century cannot yet be judged as to its\r\nfinal effect in many directions has already been made, and of nothing is\r\nthis more true than of its Art. Of one phase of this period, however, we\r\nmay speak with confidence. No other century of which we know the history\r\nhas seen so many changes--such progress, or such energy of purpose so\r\nlargely rewarded as in the century we are considering.\r\n\r\nTo one who has lived through more than three score years of this period,\r\nno fairy tale is more marvellous than the changes in the department of\r\ndaily life alone.\r\n\r\nWhen I recall the time when the only mode of travel was by stage-coach,\r\nboat, or private carriage--when the journey from Boston to St. Louis\r\ndemanded a week longer in time than we now spend in going from Boston to\r\nEgypt--when no telegraph existed--when letter postage was twenty-five\r\ncents and the postal service extremely primitive--when no house was\r\ncomfortably warmed and women carried foot-stoves to unheated\r\nchurches--when candles and oil lamps were the only means of \"lighting\r\nup,\" and we went about the streets at night with dim lanterns--when women\r\nspun and wove and sewed with their hands only, and all they accomplished\r\nwas done at the hardest--when in our country a young girl might almost as\r\nreasonably attempt to reach the moon as to become an artist--remembering\r\nall this it seems as if an army of magicians must incessantly have waved\r\ntheir wands above us, and that human brains and hands could not have\r\ninvented and put in operation the innumerable changes in our daily life\r\nduring the last half-century.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the same way, we review the changes that have taken place in the\r\ndomains of science, in scholarly research in all directions, in printing,\r\nbookmaking, and the methods of illustrating everything that is\r\nprinted--from the most serious and learned writing to advertisements\r\nscattered over all-out-of-doors--when we add to these the revolutions in\r\nmany other departments of life and industry, we must regard the\r\nnineteenth as the century _par excellence_ of expansion, and in various\r\ndirections an epoch-making era.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to our special subject we find an activity and expansion in\r\nnineteenth-century art quite in accordance with the spirit of the time.\r\nThis expansion is especially noticeable in the increased number of\r\nsubjects represented in works of art, and in the invention of new methods\r\nof artistic expression.\r\n\r\nPrior to this period there had been a certain selection of such subjects\r\nfor artistic representation as could be called \"picturesque,\" and though\r\nmore ordinary and commonplace subjects might be rendered with such\r\nskill--such drawing, color, and technique--as to demand approbation, it\r\nwas given with a certain condescension and the feeling was manifested\r\nthat these subjects, though treated with consummate art, were not\r\nartistic. The nineteenth century has signally changed these theories.\r\n\r\nNothing that makes a part in human experience is now too commonplace or\r\ntoo unusual and mysterious to afford inspiration to painter and sculptor;\r\nwhile the normal characteristics of human beings and the circumstances\r\ncommon to their lives are not omitted, the artist frequently endeavors to\r\nexpress in his work the most subtle experiences of the heart and soul,\r\nand to embody in his picture or statue an absolutely psychologic\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe present easy communication with all nations has awakened interest in\r\nthe life of countries almost unknown to us a half-century ago. So\r\ncustomary is it for artists to wander far and wide, seeking new motives\r\nfor their works, that I felt no surprise when I recently received a\r\nletter from a young American woman who is living and painting in Biskra.\r\nHow short a time has passed since this would have been thought\r\nimpossible!\r\n\r\nIt is also true that subjects not new in art are treated in a\r\nnineteenth-century manner. This is noticeable in the picturing of\r\nhistorical subjects. The more intimate knowledge of the world enables the\r\nhistorical painter of the present to impart to his representations of the\r\nimportant events of the past a more human and emotional element than\r\nexists in the historical art of earlier centuries. In a word,\r\nnineteenth-century art is sympathetic, and has found inspiration in all\r\ncountries and classes and has so treated its subjects as to be\r\nintelligible to all, from the favored children for whom Kate Greenaway,\r\nWalter Crane, and many others have spent their delightful talents, to men\r\nand women of all varieties of individual tastes and of all degrees of\r\nability to comprehend and appreciate artistic representations.\r\n\r\nA fuller acquaintance with the art and art-methods of countries of which\r\nbut little had before been known has been an element in art expansion.\r\nTechnical methods which have not been absolutely adopted by European and\r\nEnglish-speaking artists have yet had an influence upon their art. The\r\ninterest in Japanese Art is the most important example of such influence,\r\nand it is also true that Japanese artists have been attracted to the\r\nstudy of the art of America and Europe, while some foreign artists\r\nresident in Japan--notably Miss Helen Hyde, a young American--have\r\nstudied and practised Japanese painting to such purpose that Japanese\r\njuries have accorded the greatest excellence and its honors to their\r\nworks, exhibited in competition with native artists.\r\n\r\nOther factors in the expansion of art have been found in photography and\r\nthe various new methods of illustration that have filled books,\r\nmagazines, and newspapers with pictures of more or less (?) merit. Even\r\nthe painting of \"posters\" has not been scorned by good artists, some of\r\nwhom have treated them in such a manner as to make them worthy a place in\r\nmuseums where only works of true merit are exhibited.\r\n\r\nOther elements in the nineteenth-century expansion in art are seen in the\r\nimproved productions of the so-called Arts and Crafts which are of\r\ninestimable value in cultivating the artistic sense in all classes.\r\nAnother influence in the same direction is the improved decoration of\r\nporcelain, majolica, and pottery, which, while not equal to that of\r\nearlier date in the esteem of connoisseurs, brings artistic objects to\r\nthe sight and knowledge of all, at prices suited to moderate means.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn America the unparalleled increase of Free Libraries has brought, not\r\nbooks alone, but collections of photographs and other reproductions of\r\nthe best Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture in the world, as well as\r\nmedals, book-plates, artistic bindings, etc., within reach of students of\r\nart.\r\n\r\nArt Academies and Museums have also been greatly multiplied. It is often\r\na surprise to find, in a comparatively small town, a fine Art Gallery,\r\nrich in a variety of precious objects. Such an one is the Art Museum of\r\nBowdoin College, in Brunswick, Me. The edifice itself is the most\r\nbeautiful of the works by McKim that I have seen. The frescoes by La\r\nFarge and Vedder are most satisfactory, and one exhibit, among many of\r\ninterest--that of original drawings by famous Old Masters--would make\r\nthis Museum a worthy place of pilgrimage. Can one doubt that such a\r\nMuseum must be an element of artistic development in those who are in\r\ncontact with it?\r\n\r\nI cannot omit saying that this splendid monument to the appreciation of\r\nart and to great generosity was the gift of women, while the artists who\r\nperfected its architecture and decorations are Americans; it is an\r\nimpressive expression of the expansion of American Art in the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe advantages for the study of Art have been largely improved and\r\nincreased in this period. In numberless studios small classes of pupils\r\nare received; in schools of Design, schools of National Academies, and in\r\nthose of individual enterprise, all possible advantages for study under\r\nthe direction of the best artists are provided, and these are\r\nsupplemented by scholarships which relieve the student of limited means\r\nfrom providing for daily needs.\r\n\r\nAll these opportunities are shared by men and women alike. Every\r\nadvantage is as freely at the command of one as of the other, and we\r\nequal, in this regard, the centuries of the Renaissance, when women were\r\nArtists, Students, and Professors of Letters and of Law, filling these\r\npositions with honor, as women do in these days.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 T. Adolphus Trollope, in his \"Decade of Italian Women,\" in which\r\nhe wrote of the scholarly women of the Renaissance, says: \"The degree in\r\nwhich any social system has succeeded in ascertaining woman's proper\r\nposition, and in putting her into it, will be a very accurate test of the\r\nprogress it has made in civilization. And the very general and growing\r\nconviction that our own social arrangements, as they exist at present,\r\nhave not attained any satisfactory measure of success in this respect,\r\nwould seem, therefore, to indicate that England in her nineteenth century\r\nhas not yet reached years of discretion after all.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Elisabetta Sirani he says: \"The humbly born artist, admirable\r\nfor her successful combination in perfect compatibility of all the duties\r\nof home and studio.\" Of how many woman artists we can now say this.\r\n\r\nTrollope's estimate of the position of women in England, which was not\r\nunlike that in America, forty-five years ago, when contrasted with that\r\nof the present day, affords another striking example of the expansion of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough no important changes occur without some preparation, this may be\r\nso gradual and unobtrusive in its work that the result appears to have a\r\nMinerva-like birth. Doubtless there were influences leading up to the\r\nremarkable landscape painting of this century. The \"Norwich School,\"\r\nwhich took shape in 1805, was founded by Crome, among whose associates\r\nwere Cotman, Stark, and Vincent. Crome exhibited his works at the Royal\r\nAcademy in 1806, and the twelve following years, and died in 1821 when\r\nthe pictures of Constable were attracting unusual attention; indeed, it\r\nmay be said that by his exhibitions at the Royal Academy, Constable\r\ninaugurated modern landscape painting, which is a most important feature\r\nof art in this century.\r\n\r\nNot forgetting the splendid landscapes of the Dutch masters, of the early\r\nItalians, of Claude and Wilson, the claim that landscape painting was\r\nperfected only in the nineteenth century, and then largely as the result\r\nof the works of English artists, seems to me to be well founded. To this\r\nexcellence Turner, contemporary with Constable, David Cox, De Wint,\r\nBonington, and numerous others gloriously contributed.\r\n\r\nThe English landscapes exhibited at the French Salon in the third decade\r\nof the century produced a remarkable effect, and emphasized the interest\r\nin landscape painting already growing in France, and later so splendidly\r\ndeveloped by Rousseau, Corot, Millet, and their celebrated\r\ncontemporaries. In Germany the Achenbachs, Lessing, and many other\r\nartists were active in this movement, while in America, Innes, A. H.\r\nWyant, and Homer Martin, with numerous followers, were raising landscape\r\nart to an eminence before unknown.\r\n\r\nFormerly landscapes had been used as backgrounds, oftentimes attractive\r\nand beautiful, while the real purpose of the pictures centred in the\r\nhuman figures. The distinctive feature of nineteenth-century landscape is\r\nthe representation of Nature alone, and the variety of method used and\r\nthe differing aims of the artists cover the entire gamut between absolute\r\nRealism and the most pronounced Impressionism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the century there emerged from the older schools two\r\nothers which may be called the Realist and Idealist, and indeed there\r\nwere those to whom both these terms could be applied, both methods being\r\nunited in their remarkable works. Of the Realists Corot and Courbet are\r\ndistinguished, as were Puvis de Chavannes and Gustave Moreau among the\r\nIdealists.\r\n\r\nMillet, with his marvellous power of observation, painted his landscapes\r\nwith the fidelity of his school in that art, and so keenly realized the\r\nreligious element in the peasant life about him--the poetry of these\r\npeople--that he portrayed his figures in a manner quite his own--at the\r\nsame time realistic and full of idealism. MacColl in his\r\n\"Nineteenth-Century Art\" called Millet \"the most religious figure in\r\nmodern art after Rembrandt,\" and adds that \"he discovered a patience of\r\nbeauty, a reconciling, in the concert of landscape mystery with labor.\"\r\n\r\nShall we call Bastien Lepage a follower of Millet, or say that in these\r\nmen there was a unity of spirit; that while they realized the poetry of\r\ntheir subjects intensely, they fully estimated the reality as well?\r\n\r\nThe \"Joan of Arc\" is a phenomenal example of this art. The landscape is\r\ncarefully realistic, and like that in which a French peasant girl of any\r\nperiod would live. But here realism ceases and the peasant girl becomes a\r\nsupremely exalted being, entranced by a vision of herself in full armor.\r\n\r\nThis art, at once realistic and idealistic, is an achievement of the\r\nnineteenth century--so clear and straightforward in its methods as to\r\nexplain itself far better than words can explain it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nContemporary with these last-named artists were the Pre-raphaelites. The\r\ncentre of this school was called the Brotherhood, which was founded by J.\r\nE. Millais, W. Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and William Michael\r\nRossetti. To these were added Thomas Woolner the sculptor, James Collins,\r\nand F. G. Stephens. Other important artists known as Pre-raphaelites, not\r\nbelonging to the Brotherhood, are Ford Madox Brown and Burne Jones, as\r\nwell as the water-color painters, Mason, Walker, Boyce, and Goodwin.\r\n\r\nThe aim of these artists was to represent with sincerity what they saw,\r\nand the simple sincerity of painters who preceded Raphael led them to\r\nchoose a name which Ruskin called unfortunate, \"because the principles\r\non which its members are working are neither pre- nor post-Raphaelite,\r\nbut everlasting. They are endeavoring to paint with the highest possible\r\ndegree of completion what they see in nature, without reference to\r\nconventional established rules; but by no means to imitate the style of\r\nany past epoch. To paint Nature--Nature as it was around them, by the\r\nhelp of modern science, was the aim of the Brotherhood.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time when the Pre-raphaelite School came into being the art of\r\nother lands as well as that of England was in need of an awakening\r\nimpulse, and the Pre-raphaelite revolt against conventionality and the\r\nmachine-like art of the period roused such interest, criticism, and\r\nopposition as to stimulate English art to new effort, and much of its\r\nprogress in the last half-century is doubtless due to the discussions of\r\nthe theories of this movement as well as of the works it produced.\r\n\r\nPre-raphaelitism, scorned and ridiculed in its beginning, came to be\r\nappreciated in a degree that at first seemed impossible, and though its\r\napostles were few, its influence was important. The words of Burne Jones,\r\nin which he gave his own ideal, appeal to many artists and lovers of art:\r\n\"I mean by a picture a beautiful, romantic dream of something that never\r\nwas, never will be--in a light better than any light that ever shone--in\r\na land no one can define or remember, only desire--and the forms divinely\r\nbeautiful.\"\r\n\r\nRossetti's \"Girlhood of Virgin Mary,\" Holman Hunt's \"Light of the World,\"\r\nand Millais' \"Christ in the House of His Parents\" have been called the\r\nTrilogy of Pre-raphaelite Art.\r\n\r\nMillais did not long remain a strict disciple of this school, but soon\r\nadopted the fuller freedom of his later work, which may be called that of\r\nmodern naturalism. Rossetti remained a Pre-raphaelite through his short\r\nlife, but his works could not be other than individual, and their\r\ndistinct personality almost forbade his being considered a disciple of\r\nany school.\r\n\r\nHolman Hunt may be called the one persistent follower of this cult. He\r\nhas consistently embodied his convictions in his pictures, the value of\r\nwhich to English art cannot yet be determined. This is also true of the\r\nmarvellous work of Burne Jones; but although they have but few faithful\r\nfollowers, Pre-raphaelite art no longer needs defence nor apology.\r\n\r\nIts secondary effect is far-reaching. To it may be largely attributed the\r\nmore earnest study of Nature as well as the simplicity of treatment and\r\nlack of conventionality which now characterizes English art to an extent\r\nbefore unknown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImpressionism is the most distinctive feature of nineteenth-century art,\r\nand is too large a subject to be treated in an introduction--any proper\r\nconsideration of it demands a volume.\r\n\r\nThe entire execution of a picture out-of-doors was sometimes practised by\r\nConstable, more frequently by Turner, and some of the peculiarities of\r\nthe French impressionist artists were shared by the English landscape\r\npainters of the early part of the century. While no one could dream of\r\ncalling Constable an impressionist, it is interesting to recall the\r\nreception of his \"Opening of Waterloo Bridge.\" Ridiculed in London, it\r\nwas accepted in Paris, and is now honored at the Royal Academy.\r\n\r\nThis picture was covered with pure white, in impasto, a method dear to\r\nimpressionists. Was Constable in advance of his critics? is a question\r\nthat comes involuntarily to mind as we read the life of this artist, and\r\nrecall the excitement which the exhibition of his works caused at the\r\nSalon of 1824, and the interest they aroused in Delacroix and other\r\nFrench painters.\r\n\r\nThe word Impressionism calls to mind the names of Manet, Monet, Pissaro,\r\nMme. Berthe Morisot, Paul Cézanne, Whistler, Sargent, Hassam, and many\r\nothers. Impressionists exhibited their pictures in Paris as early as\r\n1874; not until 1878 were they seen to advantage in London, when Whistler\r\nexhibited in the Grosvenor Gallery; and the New English Art Club, founded\r\nin 1885, was the outcome of the need of this school to be better\r\nrepresented in its special exhibitions than was possible in other\r\ngalleries.\r\n\r\nIn a comprehensive sense Impressionism includes all artists who represent\r\ntheir subjects with breadth and collectiveness rather than in detail--in\r\nthe way in which we see a view at the first glance, before we have time\r\nto apprehend its minor parts. The advocates of impressionism now claim\r\nthat it is the most reformatory movement in modern painting; it is\r\nundeniably in full accord with the spirit of the time in putting aside\r\nolder methods and conventions and introducing a new manner of seeing and\r\nrepresenting Nature.\r\n\r\nThe differing phases of Painting in the nineteenth century have had their\r\neffect upon that art as a whole. Each one has been important, not only in\r\nthe country of its special development, but in other lands, each\r\ndistinctive quality being modified by individual and national\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the early decades of the past century Sculpture was \"classic\" and\r\nconventional rather than natural and sincere. A revolt against these\r\nconditions produced such artists as Rodin, St. Gaudens, MacMonnies, and\r\nmany less famous men who have put life, spirit, and nature into their\r\nart.\r\n\r\nIn Sculpture as in Painting many more subjects are treated than were\r\nformerly thought suited to representation in marble and bronze, and a\r\nlarge proportion of these recent _motifs_ demand a broad method of\r\ntreatment--a manner often called \"unfinished\" by those who approve only\r\nthe smooth polish of an antique Venus, and would limit sculpture to the\r\nnarrow class of subjects with which this smoothness harmonizes.\r\n\r\nThe best sculptors of the present treat the minor details of their\r\nsubjects in a sketchy, or, as some critics contend, in a rough imperfect\r\nmanner, while others find that this treatment of detail, combined with a\r\ncareful, comprehensive treatment of the important parts, emphasizes the\r\nmeaning and imparts strength to the whole, as no smoothness can do.\r\n\r\nAlthough the highest possibilities in sculpture may not yet be reached,\r\nit is animated with new spirit of life and nature. Nineteenth-century\r\naims and modes of expression have greatly enlarged its province. Like\r\nPainting, Sculpture has become democratic. It glorifies Labor and all\r\nthat is comprised in the term \"common, every-day life,\" while it also\r\ncommemorates noble and useful deeds with genuine sympathy and an\r\nintelligent appreciation of the best to which humanity attains; at the\r\nsame time poetical fancies, myths, and legends are not neglected, but are\r\nrendered with all possible delicacy and tenderness.\r\n\r\nAt present a great number of women are sculptors. The important\r\ncommissions which are given them in connection with the great expositions\r\nof the time--the execution of memorial statues and monuments, fountains,\r\nand various other works which is confided to them, testifies to their\r\nexcellence in their art with an emphasis beyond that of words.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWant of space forbids any special mention of etching, metal work,\r\nenamelling, designing, and decorative work in many directions in which\r\nwomen in great numbers are engaged; indeed, in what direction can we look\r\nin which women are not employed--I believe I may say by thousands--in all\r\nthe minor arts? Between the multitude that pursue the Fine Arts and\r\nkindred branches for a maintenance--and are rarely heard of--and those\r\nfortunate ones who are commissioned to execute important works, there is\r\nan enormous middle class. Paris is their Mecca, but they are known in all\r\nart centres, and it is by no means unusual for an artist to study under\r\nDutch, German, and Italian masters, as well as French.\r\n\r\nThe present method of study in Paris--in such academies as that of Julian\r\nand the Colarossi--secures to the student the criticism and advice of the\r\nbest artists of the day, while in summer--in the country and by the\r\nsea--there are artistic colonies in which students lead a delightful\r\nlife, still profiting by the instruction of eminent masters.\r\n\r\nYear by year the opportunities for art-study by women have been increased\r\nuntil they are welcome in the schools of the world, with rare exceptions.\r\nThe highest goal seems to have been reached by their admission to the\r\ncompetition for the _Grand prix de Rome_ conferred by _l'École des Beaux\r\nArts_.\r\n\r\nI regret that the advantages of the American Art Academy in Rome are not\r\nopen to women. The fact that for centuries women have been members and\r\nprofessors in the Academy of St. Luke, and in view of the recent action\r\nof _l'École des Beaux Arts_, this narrowness of the American Academy in\r\nthe Eternal City is especially pronounced.\r\n\r\nOne can but approve the encouragement afforded women artists in France,\r\nby the generosity with which their excellence is recognized.\r\n\r\nTo be an officer in the French Academy is an honor surpassed in France by\r\nthat of the Legion of Honor only. Within a twelvemonth two hundred and\r\nseventy-five women have been thus distinguished, twenty-eight of them\r\nbeing painters and designers. From this famous Academy down, through the\r\nInternational Expositions, the Salons, and the numberless exhibitions in\r\nvarious countries, a large proportion of medals and other honors are\r\nconferred on women, who, having now been accorded all privileges\r\nnecessary for the pursuit of art and for its recompense, will surely\r\nprove that they richly merit every good that can be shared with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>AARESTRUP, MARIE HELENE.</b> Born at Flekkefjord, Norway, 1829.

Her picture of \"Breakfast in the\r\nConservatory\" is in the Museum of Pau.\r\n\r\nMme. Abbema illustrated \"La Mer,\" by Maizeroy, and has contributed to the\r\n_Gazette des Beaux-Arts_ and several other Parisian publications.\r\n\r\nAt the Salon of the Artistes Français, 1902, she exhibited the \"Portrait\r\nof Pierre,\" and in 1903 a portrait of the Countess P. S.\r\n\r\nMme. Abbema wears her hair short, and affects such absolute simplicity in\r\nher costume that at first sight she reminds one of a charming young man.\r\nIn no other direction, however, is there a masculine touch about this\r\ndelightful artist. She has feminine grace, a love for poetry, a passion\r\nfor flowers, which she often introduces in her pictures; she has, in\r\nshort, a truly womanly character, which appears in the refinement and\r\nattractiveness of her work.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ABBOTT, KATHERINE G.</b> Bronze medal, Paris Exposition, 1900; honorable\r\nmention, Buffalo Exposition, 1901.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ACHILLE-FOULD, MLLE.

Officer of Public Instruction; member of the Société des Artistes\r\nFrançais. Born at Asnières (Seine). Pupil of Cabanel, Antoine Vollon, and\r\nLéon Comerre.\r\n\r\nA painter of figure subjects and portraits. Several of her works are in\r\nprivate collections in the United States. Among these are the\r\n\"Flower-Seller,\" the \"Knife-Grinder,\" \"M. de Richelieu's Love Knots,\"\r\nexhibited in the Salon of 1902, and \"Going to School.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Dull Season\" is in London; \"Cinderella\" and many others in Paris.\r\n\r\nThis artist, when still in short skirts, sent her first picture, \"In the\r\nMarket Place,\" to the Salon of 1884. She is most industrious, and her\r\nhistory, as she herself insists, is in her pictures. She has been\r\nsurrounded by a sympathetic and artistic atmosphere. Her mother was an\r\nart critic, who, before her second marriage to Prince Stirberg, signed\r\nher articles Gustave Haller. Her home, the Château de Bécon, is an ideal\r\nhome for an artist, and one can well understand her distaste for realism\r\nand the professional model.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Richelieu's Love Knots\" is very attractive and was one of the\r\nsuccesses of 1902. He is a fine gentleman to whom a bevy of young girls\r\nis devoted, tying his ribbons, and evidently admiring him and his\r\nexquisite costume. The girls are smiling and much amused, while the young\r\nman has an air of immense satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt the Salon of 1903 Mlle. Fould exhibited \"La\r\nChatouilleuse\"--Tickling--and \"Nasturtiums.\" The first shows a young\r\nwoman seated, wearing a décolleté gown, while a mischievous companion\r\nsteals up behind and tickles her neck with a twig. It is less attractive\r\nthan many of this artist's pictures.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Mlle. Fould painted a portrait of her stepfather, and for a time\r\ndevoted herself to portraits rather than to the subjects she had before\r\nstudied with such success. In 1893 she painted a portrait of Rosa\r\nBonheur, in her studio, while the latter paused from her work on a large\r\npicture of lions. This portrait presents the great animal painter in a\r\ncalm, thoughtful mood, in the midst of her studio, surrounded by sketches\r\nand all the accessories of her work. In the opinion of many who knew the\r\ngreat artist most intimately this is the best portrait of her in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nMlle. Fould, at different periods, has painted legendary subjects, at\r\nother times religious pictures, but in my judgment the last were the\r\nleast successful of her works.\r\n\r\nHer \"Cinderella\" is delightful; the two \"Merry Wives of Windsor,\" sitting\r\non the basket in which Falstaff is hidden, and from which he is pushing\r\nout a hand, is an excellent illustration of this ever-amusing story, and,\r\nindeed, all her pictures of this class may well be praised.\r\n\r\nTo the Exposition of 1900 she sent an allegorical picture, called \"The\r\nGold Mine.\" A young woman in gold drapery drops gold coins from her\r\nhands. In the background is the entrance to a mine, lighted dimly by a\r\nminer's lamp, while a pickaxe lies at the feet of the woman; this picture\r\nwas accorded a bronze medal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ADAM, MME.

In Stockholm\r\nshe received instruction from the sculptor Ovarnström and the painter\r\nEkman; after her father's death she went to Paris and entered the atelier\r\nof Cogniet, and later did some work under the direction of her countrymen\r\nWickenberg and Wahlbom. She had, at this time, already made herself known\r\nthrough her copies of some of the Italian masters and Murillo. Her copy\r\nof the Sistine Madonna was placed by Queen Josephine in the Catholic\r\nchurch at Christiania. After her return from Dresden where she went from\r\nParis, she painted portraits of King Oscar and Queen Josephine. In 1851,\r\nhaving received a government scholarship, she went to Munich, Bologna,\r\nand Florence, and lived three years and a half in Rome, where she was\r\nassociated with Fogelberg, Overbeck, and Schnetz, and became a Catholic.\r\nDuring this time she copied Raphael's \"Transfiguration,\" now in the\r\nCatholic church at Stockholm, and painted from life a portrait of Pius\r\nIX. for the castle at Drottningholm. She also painted a \"Roman Dancing\r\nGirl\" and a \"Beggar Girl of Terracina.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>AHRENS, ELLEN WETHERALD.</b> Second Toppan prize, Pennsylvania Academy\r\nof Fine Arts.

Following her father to Perugia in 1874, whither he had been\r\ncalled to the Court of Appeals, she continued her study under Moretti.\r\nShe married Ferdinando Fabretti in 1877. She made admirable copies of\r\nsome of the best pictures in Perugia, notably Perugino's \"Presepio\" for a\r\nchurch in Mount Lebanon, Syria. She was also commissioned to paint an\r\naltar-piece, representing St. Stephen, for the same church. Her interiors\r\nare admirable. She exhibited an \"Interior of the Great Hall of the\r\nExchange of Perugia\" in 1884, at Turin. She painted two interior views of\r\nthe church of San Giovanni del Cambio in Perugia, and an interior of the\r\nvestibule of the Confraternity of St. Francis.

Member of the Royal Society of Painters in\r\nWater Colors, London. Born near Burton-on-Trent, 1848. Began the study of\r\nart at fourteen, in Birmingham School of Art, where she remained about\r\nfive years, when she entered the schools of the Royal Academy, where\r\ninstruction is given by the Royal Academicians in turn. In 1868 she went\r\nto Italy.\r\n\r\nHer first exhibition at the Royal Academy occurred in 1874, under the\r\nname Helen Patterson; her pictures were \"Wait for Me\" and \"The Milkmaid.\"\r\nSince that time Mrs. Allingham has constantly exhibited at the Academy\r\nand many other exhibitions.\r\n\r\nHer pictures are of genre subjects, chiefly from English rural life and\r\nlandscapes. She has also been successful as an illustrator for the\r\n_Graphic_, the _Cornhill Magazine_, and other publications. Her\r\nwater-color portraits of Carlyle in his later years are well known. She\r\nintroduced his cat \"Tib\" into a portrait taken in his Chelsea garden.\r\n\r\nAmong her most ambitious works are the \"Young Customers,\" the \"Old Men's\r\nGarden, Chelsea Hospital,\" the \"Lady of the Manor,\" \"Confidences,\"\r\n\"London Flowers,\" and others of kindred motives.\r\n\r\nThe \"Young Customers,\" water-color, was exhibited at Paris in 1878. When\r\nseen at the Academy in 1875, Ruskin wrote of it: \"It happens curiously\r\nthat the only drawing of which the memory remains with me as a possession\r\nout of the Old Water-Color Exhibition of this year--Mrs. Allingham's\r\n'Young Customers'--should be not only by an accomplished designer of\r\nwoodcuts, but itself the illustration of a popular story. The drawing\r\nwith whatever temporary purpose executed, is forever lovely; a thing\r\nwhich I believe Gainsborough would have given one of his own paintings\r\nfor--old-fashioned as red-tipped dresses are, and more precious than\r\nrubies.\"--_Notes of the Academy_, 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ALMA-TADEMA, LADY LAURA THERESE.</b> Gold medal at International Art\r\nExhibition, Berlin, 1876; medal at Chicago, 1893; second-class medal at\r\nParis Exhibition, 1900. Born in London. From early childhood this artist\r\nwas fond of drawing and had the usual drawing-class lessons at school and\r\nalso drew from the antique in the British Museum. Her serious study,\r\nhowever, began at the age of eighteen, under the direction of Laurenz\r\nAlma-Tadema.\r\n\r\nHer pictures are principally of domestic scenes, child-life, and other\r\ngenre subjects. \"Battledore and Shuttlecock\" is an interior, with a\r\ngraceful girl playing the game, to the amusement of a young child sitting\r\non a nurse's lap. The room is attractive, the accessories well painted,\r\nand a second girl just coming through the door and turning her eyes up to\r\nthe shuttlecock is an interesting figure.\r\n\r\nOf quite a different character is the picture called \"In Winter.\" The\r\nlandscape is very attractive. In a sled, well wrapped up, is a little\r\ngirl, with a doll on her lap; the older boy--brother?--who pushes the\r\nsled from behind, leaning over the child, does his part with a will, and\r\nthe dignified and serious expression on the face of the little girl in\r\nthe sled indicates her sense of responsibility in the care of the doll as\r\nwell as a feeling of deep satisfaction in her enjoyable outing.\r\n\r\nAmong the more important pictures by Lady Alma-Tadema are \"Hush-a-Bye,\"\r\n\"Parting,\" in the Art Gallery at Adelaide, New South Wales, \"Silent\r\nPersuasion,\" \"The Carol,\" and \"Satisfaction.\" Her picture in the Academy\r\nExhibition, 1903, a Dutch interior with a young mother nursing \"The\r\nFirstborn,\" was much admired and was in harmony with the verse,\r\n\r\n    Lie on mother's knee, my own,\r\n      Dance your heels about me!\r\n    Apples leave the tree, my own.\r\n      Soon you'll live without me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>AMEN, MADAME J.</b> Honorable mention, Paris, 1901.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ANGUISCIOLA, LUCIA.</b> A pupil of her sister Sofonisba, painted a\r\nlife-size portrait of Piermaria, a physician of Cremona. It is in the\r\ngallery of the Prado, Madrid, and is signed, \"Lucia Angvisola Amilcares.\r\nF. Adolescens.\"\r\n\r\nLucia's portrait of her sister Europa is at Brescia. Some authorities\r\nbelieve that the small portrait in the Borghese Gallery is by Lucia,\r\nalthough it has been attributed to Sofonisba.\r\n\r\nVasari relates that Europa and a younger sister, Anna Maria, were\r\nartists. A picture of the Holy Family, inscribed with Europa's name, was\r\nformerly in the possession of a vicar of the church of San Pietro; it was\r\nof far less merit than the works of her sisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ANGUISCIOLA, SOFONISBA.</b> Born in Cremona, about 1539. Daughter of the\r\npatrician, Amilcare Anguisciola, whose only fame rests on the fact that\r\nhe was the father of six daughters, all of whom were distinguished by\r\nunusual talents in music and painting. Dear old Vasari was so charmed by\r\nhis visit to their palace that he pronounced it \"the very home of\r\npainting and of all other accomplishments.\"\r\n\r\nSofonisba was the second daughter. The actual date of her birth is\r\nunknown, but from various other dates that we have concerning her, that\r\ngiven above is generally adopted. She was educated with great care and\r\nbegan her study of drawing and painting when but seven years old, under\r\nthe care of Bernardino Campi, the best artist of the five Campi of\r\nCremona. Later she was a pupil of Bernardino Gatti, \"il Sojaro,\" and in\r\nturn she superintended the artistic studies of her sisters.\r\n\r\nSofonisba excelled in portraits, and when twenty-four years old was known\r\nall over Italy as a good artist. Her extraordinary proficiency at an\r\nearly age is proved by a picture in the Yarborough collection, London--a\r\nportrait of a man, signed, and dated 1551, when she was not more than\r\ntwelve years old.\r\n\r\nWhen presented at the court of Milan, then under Spanish rule, Sofonisba\r\nwas brought to the notice of Philip II., who, through his ambassador,\r\ninvited her to fill the office of court painter at Madrid. Flattering as\r\nthis invitation must have been to the artist and her family, it is not\r\nsurprising that she hesitated and required time for consideration of this\r\nhonorable proposal.\r\n\r\nThe reputation of the ceremonious Spanish court, under its gloomy and\r\nexacting sovereign, was not attractive to a young woman already\r\nsurrounded by devoted admirers, to one of whom she had given her heart.\r\nThe separation from her family, too, and the long, fatiguing journey to\r\nSpain, were objections not easily overcome, and her final acceptance of\r\nthe proposal was a proof of her energy and strength of purpose.\r\n\r\nHer journey was made in 1560 and was conducted with all possible care for\r\nher comfort. She was attended by two noble ladies as maids of honor, two\r\nchamberlains, and six servants in livery--in truth, her mode of\r\ntravelling differed but little from that of the young ladies of the royal\r\nfamily. As she entered Madrid she was received by the king and queen, and\r\nby them conducted to the royal palace.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine Sofonisba's pleasure in painting the portrait of the\r\nlovely Isabella, and her pictures of Philip and his family soon raised\r\nher to the very summit of popularity. All the grandees of Madrid desired\r\nto have their portraits from her hand, and rich jewels and large sums of\r\nmoney were showered upon her.\r\n\r\nGratifying as was her artistic success, the affection of the queen, which\r\nshe speedily won, was more precious to her. She was soon made a\r\nlady-in-waiting to her Majesty, and a little later was promoted to the\r\ndistinguished position of governess to the Infanta Clara Eugenia.\r\n\r\nThat Sofonisba fully appreciated her gentle mistress is shown in her\r\nletter to Pope Pius IV., who had requested her to send him a portrait of\r\nthe queen. She wrote that no picture could worthily figure the royal\r\nlady, and added: \"If it were possible to represent to your Holiness the\r\nbeauty of the Queen's soul, you could behold nothing more wonderful.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pope bestowed rich gifts on Sofonisba, among which were sacred\r\nrelics, set with gems. He also wrote an autograph letter, still in\r\nexistence, in which he assured her that much as he admired her skill in\r\npainting, he had been led to believe this the least of her many gifts.\r\n\r\nSofonisba soon gained the approval of the serious and solemn King, for\r\nwhile Philip was jealous of the French ladies of the court and desired\r\nIsabella to be wholly under Spanish influence, he proposed to the artist\r\na marriage with one of his nobles, by which means she would remain\r\npermanently in the Queen's household. When Philip learned that Sofonisba\r\nwas already betrothed to Don Fabrizio de Monçada--a Sicilian nobleman--in\r\nspite of his disappointment he joined Isabella in giving her a dowry of\r\ntwelve thousand crowns and a pension of one thousand.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that one who could so soften the heart and manners of\r\nPhilip II. as did Queen Isabella, must have had a charm of person and\r\ncharacter that no ordinary mortal could resist. One is compelled to a\r\nkindly feeling for this much-hated man, who daily visited the Queen when\r\nshe was suffering from smallpox. In her many illnesses he was tenderly\r\ndevoted to her, and when we remember the miseries of royal ladies whose\r\nchildren are girls, we almost love Philip for comforting Isabella when\r\nher first baby was not a son. Philip declared himself better pleased\r\nthat she had given him a daughter, and made the declaration good by\r\ndevotion to this child so long as he lived.\r\n\r\nIsabella, in a letter to her mother, wrote: \"But for the happiness I have\r\nof seeing the King every day I should find this court the dullest in the\r\nworld. I assure you, however, madame, that I have so kind a husband that\r\neven did I deem this place a hundredfold more wearisome I should not\r\ncomplain.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Sofonisba was overwhelmed with commissions in Spain, her sisters\r\nwere far from idle in Cremona. Europa sent pictures to Madrid which were\r\npurchased for private collections, and a picture by Lucia is now in the\r\nGallery of the Queen at Madrid.\r\n\r\nWhen the time for Sofonisba's marriage came she was sorry to leave her\r\n\"second home,\" as she called Madrid, and as Don Fabrizio lived but a\r\nshort time, the King urged her return to Spain; but her desire to be once\r\nmore with her family impelled her to return to Italy.\r\n\r\nThe ship on which she sailed from Sicily was commanded by one of the\r\nLomellini, a noble family of Genoa, with whom Sofonisba fell so\r\ndesperately in love that she offered him her hand--which, says her\r\nbiographer, \"he accepted like a generous man.\" Does this mean that she\r\nhad been ungenerous in depriving him of the privilege of asking for what\r\nshe so freely bestowed?\r\n\r\nIn Genoa she devotedly pursued her art and won new honors, while she was\r\nnot forgotten in Madrid. Presents were sent her on her second marriage,\r\nand later the Infanta Clara Eugenia and other Spaniards of exalted rank\r\nvisited her in Genoa. Her palace became a centre of attraction to\r\nGenoese artists and men of letters, while many strangers of note sought\r\nher acquaintance. She contributed largely to the restoration of art and\r\nliterature to the importance that had been accorded them in the most\r\nbrilliant days of Genoese power.\r\n\r\nWe have not space to recount all the honors conferred on Sofonisba, both\r\nas a woman and an artist. She lived to an extreme old age, and, although\r\nshe lost her sight, her intellect was undimmed by time or blindness.\r\nVandyck, who was frequently her guest, more than once declared that he\r\n\"was more benefited by the counsels of the blind Sofonisba than by all\r\nhis studies of the masters of his art!\" From a pupil of Rubens this was\r\npraise indeed!\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristics of Sofonisba's painting were grace and spirit.\r\nHer portrait of herself when at her best is in possession of the\r\nLomellini. A second is the splendid picture at Althorpe, in which she is\r\nrepresented as playing the harpsichord. One can scarcely imagine a place\r\nin which a portrait would be more severely tested than in the gallery of\r\nthe Earl of Spencer, beside portraits of lovely women and famous men,\r\npainted by master artists. Yet this work of Sofonisba's is praised by\r\ndiscerning critics and connoisseurs. Of the other portraits of herself,\r\nthat in the Uffizi is signed by her as \"of Cremona,\" which suggests that\r\nit was painted before she went to Spain. That in the Vienna Gallery is\r\ndated 1551, and inscribed Sophonisba Anguissola. Virgo. Sc. Ipsam Fecit.\r\nStill another, in which a man stands beside her, is in the Sienna\r\nGallery. He holds a brush in his hand, and is probably one of her\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nHer portrait of her sisters playing chess, while an old duenna looks on,\r\nwas in the collection of Lucien Bonaparte and is said to be now in a\r\nprivate gallery in England. Her religious pictures are rare; a \"Marriage\r\nof St. Catherine\" is in the gallery at Wilton House.\r\n\r\nShe painted several pictures of three of her sisters on one canvas; one\r\nis in the National Museum of Berlin, and a second, formerly in the\r\nLeuchtenberg Gallery, is in the Hermitage at Petersburg. A small Holy\r\nFamily, signed and dated 1559, belonged to the art critic and author,\r\nMorelli.\r\n\r\nOne regrets that so remarkable a woman left no record of her unusual\r\nexperiences. How valuable would be the story of Don Carlos from so\r\ndisinterested a person. How interesting had she told us of the _bal\r\nmasqué_, given by Isabella in the fashion of her own country, when Philip\r\ncondescended to open the ball with the Queen; or of the sylvan fêtes at\r\nAranjuez, and of the gardens made under the direction of Isabella. Of all\r\nthis she has told us nothing. We glean the story of her life from the\r\nworks of various authors, while her fame rests securely on her\r\nsuperiority in the art to which she was devoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ANCHER, ANNA KRISTINE.</b> Genre painter, won high praise at Berlin in\r\n1900 for two pictures: \"Tischgebet,\" which was masterly in its smoothness\r\nand depth of expression, and \"Eine blinde Frau in ihrer Stube,\" in which\r\nthe full sunlight streaming through the open window produced an affecting\r\ncontrast. She was born at Skagen, 1859, the daughter of Erik Brondum,\r\nand early showed her artistic tendencies. Michael Ancher (whom she\r\nmarried in 1880) noticed and encouraged her talent, which was first\r\ndisplayed in small crayons treating pathetic or humorous subjects. From\r\n1875-78 she studied with Khyn, and later more or less under the direction\r\nof her husband. She has painted exclusively small pictures, dealing with\r\nsimple and natural things, and each picture, as a rule, contains but a\r\nsingle figure. She believes that a dilapidated Skagen hovel may meet\r\nevery demand of beauty. \"Maageplukkerne\"--\"Gull plucking\"--exhibited in\r\n1883, has been called one of the most sympathetic and unaffected pieces\r\nof genre painting ever produced by a Danish artist.\r\n\r\nAn \"Old Woman of Skagen,\" \"A Mother and Child,\" and \"Coffee is Ready\"\r\nwere among the most attractive of her pictures of homely, familiar Danish\r\nlife. The last represents an old fisher, who has fallen asleep on the\r\nbench by the stove, and a young woman is waking him with the above\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\n\"A Funeral Scene\" is in the Copenhagen Gallery. The coffin is hung with\r\ngreen wreaths; the walls of the room are red; the people stand around\r\nwith a serious air. The whole story is told in a simple, homely way.\r\n\r\nIn the \"History of Modern Painters\" we read: \"All her pictures are softly\r\ntender and full of fresh light. But the execution is downright and\r\nvirile. It is only in little touches, in fine and delicate traits of\r\nobservation which would probably have escaped a man, that these paintings\r\nare recognized as the work of a feminine artist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ANTIGNA, MME. HÉLÈNE MARIE.</b> Born at Melun. Pupil of her husband,\r\nJean Pierre Antigna, and of Delacroix. Her best works are small genre\r\nsubjects, which are excellent and much admired by other artists.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 she exhibited at the Paris Salon \"On n'entre pas!\" and the \"New\r\nCider\"; in 1876, an \"Interior at Saint Brieuc\" and \"A Stable\"; in 1875,\r\n\"Tant va la cruche à l'eau,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>APPIA, MME.

Appia, before her marriage, exhibited at the Paris Salon several\r\nyears continuously. Since then she has exhibited at Turin and Geneva.\r\n\r\nShe has executed many portrait busts; among them are those of M.\r\nGuillaume Monod, Paris, Commander Paul Meiller, and a medallion portrait\r\nof Père Hyacinthe, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ARGYLL, HER ROYAL HIGHNESS, THE PRINCESS LOUISE, DUCHESS OF.</b> This\r\nartist has exhibited her work since, 1868. Although her sketches in\r\nwater-color are clever and attractive, it is as a sculptor that her best\r\nwork has been done. Pupil of Sir J. E. Boehne, R.A., her unusual natural\r\ntalent was carefully developed under his advice, and her unflagging\r\nindustry and devotion to her work have enabled her to rival sculptors who\r\nlive by their art.\r\n\r\nHer busts and lesser subjects are refined and delicate, while possessing\r\na certain individuality which this lady is known to exercise in her\r\ndirection of the assistant she is forced to employ. Her chief attainment,\r\nthe large seated figure of Queen Victoria in Kensington Gardens, is a\r\nwork of which she may well be proud.\r\n\r\nOf this statue Mr. M. H. Spielmann writes: \"The setting up of the figure,\r\nthe arrangement of the drapery, the modelling, the design of the\r\npedestal--all the parts, in fact--are such that the statue must be added\r\nto the short list of those which are genuine embellishments to the city\r\nof London.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Argyll has been commissioned to design a statue of heroic\r\nsize, to be executed in bronze and placed in Westminster Abbey, to\r\ncommemorate the colonial troops who gave up their lives in South Africa\r\nin the Boer war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ARNOLD, ANNIE R. MERRYLEES.</b> Born at Birkenhead. A Scotch miniature\r\npainter. Studied in Edinburgh, first in the School of Art, under Mr.\r\nHodder, and later in the life class of Robert Macgregor; afterward in\r\nParis under Benjamin-Constant.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arnold writes me that she thinks it important for miniature painters\r\nto do work in a more realistic medium occasionally, and something of a\r\nbolder character than can be done in their specialty. She never studied\r\nminiature painting, but took it up at the request of a patroness who,\r\nbefore the present fashion for this art had come about, complained that\r\nshe could find no one who painted miniatures. This lady gave the artist a\r\nnumber of the _Girls' Own Journal,_ containing directions for miniature\r\npainting, after which Mrs. Arnold began to work in this specialty. She\r\nhas painted a miniature of Lady Evelyn Cavendish, owned by the Marquis of\r\nLansdowne; others of the Earl and Countess of Mar and Kellie, the first\r\nof which belongs to the Royal Scottish Academy; one of Lady Helen\r\nVincent, one of the daughter of Lionel Phillips, Esquire, and several for\r\nprominent families in Baltimore and Washington. Her work is seen in the\r\nexhibitions of the Royal Academy, London.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 she exhibited miniatures of Miss M. L. Fenton, the late Mrs.\r\nCameron Corbett, and the Hon. Thomas Erskine, younger son of the Earl of\r\nMar and Kellie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ASSCHE, AMÉLIE VAN.</b> Portrait painter and court painter to Queen\r\nLouise Marie of Belgium.

She made her début at Ghent in 1820, and in Brussels in 1821,\r\nwith water-colors and pastels, and some of her miniatures figured in the\r\nvarious exhibitions at Brussels between 1830 and 1848, and in Ghent\r\nbetween 1835 and 1838. Her portraits, which are thought to be very good\r\nlikenesses, are also admirable in color, drawing, and modelling; and her\r\nportrait of Leopold I., which she painted in 1839, won for her the\r\nappointment at court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ASSCHE, ISABEL CATHERINE VAN.</b> She was born at Brussels, 1794.\r\nLandscape painter.

From childhood she painted\r\nflowers, and for a time this made no especial impression on her family or\r\nfriends, as it was not an uncommon occupation for girls. At length her\r\nfather saw that this daughter, Gerardina--for he had numerous daughters,\r\nand they all desired to be artists--had talent, and when, in 1850, the\r\nMinerva Academy at Groningen gave out \"Roses and Dahlias\" as a subject,\r\nand offered a prize of a little more than ten dollars for the best\r\nexample, he encouraged Gerardina to enter the contest. She received the\r\ncontemptible reward, and found, to her astonishment, that the Minerva\r\nAcademy considered the picture as belonging to them.\r\n\r\nHowever, this affair brought the name of the artist to the knowledge of\r\nthe public, and she determined to devote herself to the painting of\r\nflowers and fruit, in which she has won unusual fame. There is no\r\nsameness in her pictures, and her subjects do not appear to be\r\n\"arranged\"--everything seems to have fallen into its place by chance and\r\nto be entirely natural.\r\n\r\nGerardina Jacoba and her brother Julius van de Sande Bakhuyzen, the\r\nlandscape painter, share one studio. She paints with rapidity, as one\r\nmust in order to picture the freshness of fast-fading flowers.\r\n\r\nJohan Gram writes of her: \"If she paints a basket of peaches or plums,\r\nthey look as if just picked by the gardener and placed upon the table,\r\nwithout any thought of studied effect; some leaves covering the fruit,\r\nothers falling out of the basket in the most natural way. If she paints\r\nthe branch of a rose-tree, it seems to spring from the ground with its\r\nflowers in all their luxurious wantonness, and one can almost imagine\r\none's self inhaling their delightful perfume. This talented artist knows\r\nso well how to depict with her brush the transparency and softness of the\r\ntender, ethereal rose, that one may seek in vain among a crowd of artists\r\nfor her equal.... The paintings are all bright and sunny, and we are\r\nfilled with enthusiasm when gazing at her powerful works.\"\r\n\r\nThis artist was born in 1826 and died in 1895. She lived and died in her\r\nfamily residence. In 1850, at Groningen, she took for her motto, \"Be true\r\nto nature and you will produce that which is good.\" To this she remained\r\nfaithful all her days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BALDWIN, EDITH ELLA.</b> Born at Worcester, Massachusetts.

Her journal, she\r\ntells us, is absolutely truthful, and it is but courteous to take the\r\nstory of her artistic career from that. She had lessons in drawing, as\r\nmany children do, but she gives no indication of a special love for art\r\nuntil she visits Florence when fourteen years old, and her love of\r\npictures and statues is awakened. She spent hours in galleries, never\r\nsitting down, without fatigue, in spite of her delicacy. She says: \"That\r\nis because the things one loves do not tire one. So long as there are\r\npictures and, better still, statues to be seen, I am made of iron.\" After\r\nquestioning whether she dare say it, she confides to her readers: \"I\r\ndon't like the Madonna della Sedia of Raphael. The countenance of the\r\nVirgin is pale, the color is not natural, the expression is that of a\r\nwaiting-maid rather than of a Madonna. Ah, but there is a Magdalen of\r\nTitian that enchanted me. Only--there must always be an only--her wrists\r\nare too thick and her hands are too plump--beautiful hands they would be\r\non a woman of fifty. There are things of Rubens and Vandyck that are\r\nravishing. The 'Mensonge' of Salvator Rosa is very natural. I do not\r\nspeak as a connoisseur; what most resembles nature pleases me most. Is it\r\nnot the aim of painting to copy nature? I like very much the full, fresh\r\ncountenance of the wife of Paul Veronese, painted by him. I like the\r\nstyle of his faces. I adore Titian and Vandyck; but that poor Raphael!\r\nProvided only no one knows what I write; people would take me for a fool;\r\nI do not criticise Raphael; I do not understand him; in time I shall no\r\ndoubt learn to appreciate his beauties. The portrait of Pope Leo X.--I\r\nthink it is--is admirable, however.\" A surprising critique for a girl of\r\nher age!\r\n\r\nWhen seventeen she made her first picture of any importance. \"While they\r\nwere playing cards last night I made a rough sketch of the players--and\r\nthis morning I transferred the sketch to canvas. I am delighted to have\r\nmade a picture of persons sitting down in different attitudes; I copied\r\nthe position of the hands and arms, the expressions of the countenance,\r\netc. I had never before done anything but heads, which I was satisfied to\r\nscatter over the canvas like flowers.\"\r\n\r\nHer enthusiasm for her art constantly increased. She was not willing to\r\nacknowledge her semi-invalidism and was filled with the desire to do\r\nsomething in art that would live after her. She was opposed by her\r\nfamily, who wished her to be in fashionable society. At length she had\r\nher way, and when not quite eighteen began to study regularly at the\r\nJulian Academy. She worked eight and nine hours a day. Julian encouraged\r\nher, she rejoiced in being with \"real artists who have exhibited in the\r\nSalon and whose pictures are bought,\" and declared herself \"happy,\r\nhappy!\" Before long M. Julian told her that she might become a great\r\nartist, and the first time that Robert-Fleury saw her work and learned\r\nhow little she had studied, and that she had never before drawn from a\r\nliving model, he said: \"Well, then, you have extraordinary talent for\r\npainting; you are specially gifted, and I advise you to work hard.\"\r\n\r\nHer masters always assured her of her talent, but she was much of the\r\ntime depressed. She admired the work of Mlle. Breslau and acknowledged\r\nherself jealous of the Swiss artist. But after a year of study she took\r\nthe second prize in the Academy, and admitted that she ought to be\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nRobert-Fleury took much interest in her work, and she began to hope to\r\nequal Breslau; but she was as often despondent as she was happy, which no\r\ndoubt was due to her health, for she was already stricken with the malady\r\nfrom which she died. Julian wondered why, with her talent, it was so\r\ndifficult for her to paint; to herself she seemed paralyzed.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1879 she took a studio, and, besides her painting, she\r\nessayed modelling. In 1880 her portrait of her sister was exhibited at\r\nthe Salon, and her mother and other friends were gratified by its\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\nAt one time Mlle. Bashkirtseff had suffered with her eyes, and, getting\r\nbetter of that, she had an attack of deafness. For these reasons she\r\nwent, in the summer of 1880, to Mont-Dore for treatment, and was much\r\nbenefited in regard to her deafness, though not cured, and now the\r\ncondition of her lungs was recognized, and what she had realized for some\r\ntime was told to her family. She suffered greatly from the restrictions\r\nof her condition. She could not read very much, as her eyes were not\r\nstrong enough to read and paint; she avoided people because of her\r\ndeafness; her cough was very tiresome and her breathing difficult.\r\n\r\nAt the Salon of 1881 her picture was well hung and was praised by\r\nartists. In the autumn of that year she was very ill, but happily, about\r\nthe beginning of 1882, she was much better and again enthusiastic about\r\nher painting. She had been in Spain and excited admiration in Madrid by\r\nthe excellence of her copy of \"Vulcan,\" by Velasquez. January 15th she\r\nwrote: \"I am wrapped up in my art. I think I caught the sacred fire in\r\nSpain at the same time that I caught the pleurisy. From being a student I\r\nnow begin to be an artist. This sudden influx of power puts me beside\r\nmyself with joy. I sketch future pictures; I dream of painting an\r\nOphelia. Potain has promised to take me to Saint-Anne to study faces of\r\nthe mad women there, and then I am full of the idea of painting an old\r\nman, an Arab, sitting down singing to the accompaniment of a kind of\r\nguitar; and I am thinking also of a large affair for the coming Salon--a\r\nview of the Carnival; but for this it would be necessary that I should go\r\nto Nice--to Naples first for the Carnival, and then to Nice, where I have\r\nmy villa, to paint it in open air.\"\r\n\r\nShe now met Bastien-Lepage, who, while he was somewhat severe in his\r\ncriticism of her work, told her seriously that she was \"marvellously\r\ngifted.\" This gave her great pleasure, and, indeed, just at this time the\r\nwhole tone of the journal and her art enthusiasm are most comforting\r\nafter the preceding despairing months. From this time until her death\r\nher journal is largely occupied with her health, which constantly failed,\r\nbut her interest in art and her intense desire to do something worthy of\r\na great artist--something that Julian, Robert-Fleury, and, above all,\r\nBastien-Lepage, could praise, seemed to give her strength, and, in spite\r\nof the steady advance of the fell tuberculosis from which she was dying,\r\nshe worked devotedly.\r\n\r\nShe had a fine studio in a new home of the family, and was seized with an\r\nardent desire to try sculpture--she did a little in this art--but that\r\nwhich proved to be her last and best work was her contribution to the\r\nSalon of 1884. This brought her to the notice of the public, and she had\r\ngreat pleasure, although mingled with the conviction of her coming death\r\nand the doubts of her ability to do more. Of this time she writes: \"Am I\r\nsatisfied? It is easy to answer that question; I am neither satisfied nor\r\ndissatisfied. My success is just enough to keep me from being unhappy.\r\nThat is all.\"\r\n\r\nAgain: \"I have just returned from the Salon. We remained a long time\r\nseated on a bench before the picture. It attracted a good deal of\r\nattention, and I smiled to myself at the thought that no one would ever\r\nimagine the elegantly dressed young girl seated before it, showing the\r\ntips of her little boots, to be the artist. Ah, all this is a great deal\r\nbetter than last year! Have I achieved a success, in the true, serious\r\nmeaning of the word? I almost think so.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture was called the \"Meeting,\" and shows seven gamins talking\r\ntogether before a wooden fence at the corner of a street. François Coppée\r\nwrote of it: \"It is a _chef d'oeuvre_, I maintain. The faces and the\r\nattitudes of the children are strikingly real. The glimpse of meagre\r\nlandscape expresses the sadness of the poorer neighborhoods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to this time, her picture of two boys, called \"Jean and\r\nJacques,\" had been reproduced in the Russian _Illustration_, and she now\r\nreceived many requests for permission to photograph and reproduce her\r\n\"Meeting,\" and connoisseurs made requests to be admitted to her studio.\r\nAll this gratified her while it also surprised. She was at work on a\r\npicture called \"Spring,\" for which she went to Sèvres, to paint in the\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nNaturally she hoped for a Salon medal, and her friends encouraged her\r\nwish--but alas! she was cruelly disappointed. Many thought her unfairly\r\ntreated, but it was remembered that the year before she had publicly\r\nspoken of the committee as \"idiots\"!\r\n\r\nPeople now wished to buy her pictures and in many ways she realized that\r\nshe was successful. How pathetic her written words: \"I have spent six\r\nyears, working ten hours a day, to gain what? The knowledge of all I have\r\nyet to learn in my art, and a fatal disease!\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the \"Meeting\" received no medal because it was\r\nsuspected that Mlle. Bashkirtseff had been aided in her work. No one\r\ncould tell who had originated this idea, but as some medals had been\r\ngiven to women who did not paint their pictures alone, the committee were\r\ntimid, although there seems to have been no question as to superiority.\r\n\r\nA friendship had grown up between the families Bashkirtseff and\r\nBastien-Lepage. Both the great artist and the dying girl were very ill,\r\nbut for some time she and her mother visited him every two or three days.\r\nHe seemed almost to live on these visits and complained if they were\r\nomitted. At last, ill as Bastien-Lepage was, he was the better able of\r\nthe two to make a visit. On October 16th she writes of his being brought\r\nto her and made comfortable in one easy-chair while she was in another.\r\n\"Ah, if I could only paint!\" he said. \"And I?\" she replied. \"There is the\r\nend to this year's picture!\"\r\n\r\nThese visits were continued. October 20th she writes of his increasing\r\nfeebleness. She wrote no more, and in eleven days was dead.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the works of Marie Bashkirtseff were exhibited. In the catalogue\r\nwas printed François Coppée's account of a visit he had made her mother a\r\nfew months before Marie's death. He saw her studio and her works, and\r\nwrote, after speaking of the \"Meeting,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n\"At the Exhibition--Salon--before this charming picture, the public had\r\nwith a unanimous voice bestowed the medal on Mlle. B., who had been\r\nalready 'mentioned' the year before. Why was this verdict not confirmed\r\nby the jury? Because the artist was a foreigner? Who knows? Perhaps\r\nbecause of her wealth. This injustice made her suffer, and she\r\nendeavored--the noble child--to avenge herself by redoubling her efforts.\r\n\r\n\"In one hour I saw there twenty canvases commenced; a hundred\r\ndesigns--drawings, painted studies, the cast of a statue, portraits which\r\nsuggested to me the name of Frans Hals, scenes made from life in the\r\nopen streets; notably one large sketch of a landscape--the October mist\r\non the shore, the trees half stripped, big yellow leaves strewing the\r\nground. In a word, works in which is incessantly sought, or more often\r\nasserts itself, the sentiment of the sincerest and most original art, and\r\nof the most personal talent.\"\r\n\r\nMathilde Blind, in her \"Study of Marie Bashkirtseff,\" says: \"Marie loved\r\nto recall Balzac's questionable definition that the genius of observation\r\nis almost the whole of human genius. It was natural it should please her,\r\nsince it was the most conspicuous of her many gifts. As we might expect,\r\ntherefore, she was especially successful as a portrait painter, for she\r\nhad a knack of catching her sitter's likeness with the bloom of nature\r\nyet fresh upon it. All her likenesses are singularly individual, and we\r\nrealize their character at a glance. Look, for example, at her portrait\r\nof a Parisian swell, in irreproachable evening dress and white kid\r\ngloves, sucking his silver-headed cane, with a simper that shows all his\r\nwhite teeth; and then at the head and bust of a Spanish convict, painted\r\nfrom life at the prison in Granada. Compare that embodiment of\r\nfashionable vacuity with this face, whose brute-like eyes haunt you with\r\ntheir sadly stunted look. What observation is shown in the painting of\r\nthose heavily bulging lips, which express weakness rather than wickedness\r\nof disposition--in those coarse hands engaged in the feminine occupation\r\nof knitting a blue and white stocking!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BAUCK, JEANNA.</b> Born in Stockholm in 1840. Portrait and landscape\r\npainter. In 1863 she went to Dresden, and studied figure work with\r\nProfessor Ehrhardt; later she moved to Düsseldorf, where she devoted\r\nherself to landscape under Flamm, and in 1866 she settled in Munich,\r\nwhere she has since remained, making long visits to Paris, Venice, and\r\nparts of Switzerland. Her later work is marked by the romantic influence\r\nof C. Ludwig, who was for a time her instructor, but she shows unusual\r\nbreadth and sureness in dealing with difficult subjects, such as dusky\r\nforests with dark waters or bare ruins bordered with stiff, ghost-like\r\ntrees. Though not without talent and boldness, she lacks a feeling for\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BAUERLÉ, MISS A.</b>\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BAXTER, MARTHA WHEELER.</b>\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BEALE, MARY.</b> 1632-97. This artist was the daughter of the Rev. Mr.\r\nCradock. She married Mr. Beale, an artist and a color-maker. She studied\r\nunder Sir Peter Lely, who obtained for her the privilege of copying some\r\nof Vandyck's most famous works.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beale's portraits of Charles II., Cowley, and the Duke of Norfolk\r\nare in the National Portrait Gallery, London, and that of Archbishop\r\nTillotson is in Lambeth Palace. This portrait was the first example of an\r\necclesiastic represented as wearing a wig instead of the usual silk coif.\r\n\r\nHer drawing was excellent and spirited, her color strong and pure, and\r\nher portraits were sought by many distinguished persons.\r\n\r\nSeveral poems were written in praise of this artist, in one of which, by\r\nDr. Woodfall, she is called \"Belasia.\" Her husband, Charles Beale, an\r\ninferior artist, was proud of his wife, and spent much time in recording\r\nthe visits she received, the praises lavished on her, and similar matters\r\nconcerning her art and life. He left more than thirty pocket-notebooks\r\nfilled with these records, and showed himself far more content that his\r\nwife should be appreciated than any praise of himself could have made\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BEAURY-SAUREL, MME.

Associate of National Academy of\r\nDesign, member of Society of American Artists, associate of Société des\r\nBeaux-Arts, Paris. Born in Philadelphia. Studied under Mrs. T. A.\r\nJanvier, Adolf van der Weilen, and William Sartain in Philadelphia; under\r\nRobert-Fleury, Bouguereau, and Benjamin-Constant, in Paris.\r\n\r\nHer portraits are numerous. In 1894 she exhibited a portrait of a child\r\nat the Exhibition of the Society of American Artists, which was much\r\nadmired and noticed in the _Century Magazine_, September, 1894, as\r\nfollows: \"Few artists have the fresh touch which the child needs and the\r\nfirm and rapid execution which allows the painter to catch the fleeting\r\nexpression and the half-forms which make child portraits at once the\r\nlonging and the despair of portrait painters. Miss Beaux's technique is\r\naltogether French, sometimes reminding me a little of Carolus Duran and\r\nof Sargent; but her individuality has triumphed over all suggestions of\r\nher foreign masters, and the combination of refinement and strength is\r\naltogether her own.\"\r\n\r\nSeven years later, in the _International Studio_, September, 1901, we\r\nread: \"The mention of style suggests a reference to the portraits by Miss\r\nCecilia Beaux, while the allusion to characterization suggests at the\r\nsame time their limitation. The oftener one sees her 'Mother and\r\nDaughter,' which gained the gold medal at Pittsburg in 1899 and the gold\r\nmedal also at last year's Paris Exposition, the less one feels inclined\r\nto accept it as a satisfactory example of portraiture. Magnificent\r\nassurance of method it certainly has, controlled also by a fine sobriety\r\nof feeling, so that no part of the ensemble impinges upon the due\r\nimportance of the other parts; it is a balanced, dignified picture. But\r\nin its lack of intimacy it is positively callous. One has met these\r\nladies on many occasions, but with no increase of acquaintanceship or\r\ninterest on either side--our meetings are sterile of any human interest.\r\nSo one turns with relief to Miss Beaux's other picture of 'Dorothea and\r\nFrancesca'--an older girl leading a younger one in the steps of a dance.\r\nThey are not concerned with us, but at least interested in one another;\r\nand we can attach ourselves, if only as outsiders, to the human interest\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\"These pictures suggest a moment's consideration of the true meaning of\r\nthe term 'style' as applied to painting. Is it not more than the mere\r\nableness of method, still more than the audacity of brush work, that\r\noften passes for style? Is it possible to dissociate the manner of a\r\npicture from its embodiment of some fact or idea? For it to have style in\r\nthe full sense of the word, surely it must embody an expression of life\r\nas serious and thorough as the method of record.\"--_Charles H. Caffin_.\r\n\r\nIn the _International Studio_ of March, 1903, we read: \"The portrait of\r\nMrs. Roosevelt, by Miss Cecilia Beaux, seemed to me to be one of the\r\nhappiest of her creations. Nothing could exceed the skill and daintiness\r\nwith which the costume is painted, and the characterization of the head\r\nis more sympathetic than usual, offering a most winsome type of\r\nbeautiful, good womanhood. A little child has been added to the\r\npicture--an afterthought, I understand, and scarcely a fortunate one; at\r\nleast in the manner of its presentment. The figure is cleverly merged in\r\nhalf shadow, but the treatment of the face is brusque, and a most\r\nunpleasant smirk distorts the child's mouth. It is the portrait of the\r\nmother that carries the picture, and its superiority to many of Miss\r\nBeaux's portraits consists in the sympathy with her subject which the\r\npainter has displayed.\"--_Charles H. Caffin_.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Mail and Express_ says: \"Miss Beaux has approached the\r\ntask of painting the society woman of to-day, not as one to whom this\r\ntype is known only by the exterior, but with a sympathy as complete as a\r\nsimilar tradition and an artistic temperament will allow. Thus she starts\r\nwith an advantage denied to all but a very few American portrait\r\npainters, and this explains the instinctive way in which she gives to her\r\npictured subjects an air of natural ease and good breeding.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Beaux's picture of \"Brighton Cats\" is so excellent that one almost\r\nregrets that she has not emulated Mme. Ronner's example and left\r\nportraits of humans to the many artists who cannot paint cats!\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BECK, CAROL H.</b> Mary Smith prize at Pennsylvania Academy of Fine\r\nArts, 1899.

In 1873 she won a medal\r\nat Vienna, in 1875 a gold medal at the Brussels Salon, and still other\r\nmedals at Philadelphia (1876), Sydney (1879), and Teplitz (1879). She was\r\nmade Chévalier de l'Ordre de Léopold in 1881. Mlle. Beernaerts was born\r\nat Ostend, 1831, and studied under Kuhner in Brussels. She travelled in\r\nGermany, France, and Italy, and exhibited admirable landscapes at\r\nBrussels, Antwerp, and Paris, her favorite subjects being Dutch. In 1878\r\nthe following pictures by her were shown in Paris: \"Lisière de bois dans\r\nles Dunes (Zélande),\" \"Le Village de Domburg (Zélande),\" and \"Intérieur\r\nde bois à Oost-Kapel (Holland).\" Other well-known works are \"Die Campine\"\r\nand \"Aus der Umgebung von Oosterbeck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BEGAS, LUISE PARMENTIER.</b> Born in Vienna. Pupil of Schindler and\r\nUnger. She travelled extensively in Europe and the Orient, and spent some\r\ntime in Sicily. She married Adalbert Begas in 1877 and then established\r\nher studio in Berlin. Her subjects are landscape, architectural\r\nmonuments, and interiors. Some of the latter are especially fine. Her\r\npicture of the \"Burial Ground at Scutari\" was an unusual subject at the\r\ntime it was exhibited and attracted much attention.\r\n\r\nHer rich gift in the use of color is best seen in her pictures of still\r\nlife and flowers. In Berlin, in 1890, she exhibited \"Before the Walls of\r\nConstantinople\" and \"From Constantinople,\" which were essentially\r\ndifferent from her earlier works and attracted much attention. \"Taormina\r\nin Winter\" more nearly resembled her earlier pictures.\r\n\r\nFräulein Parmentier also studied etching, in which art Unger was her\r\ninstructor. In her exquisite architectural pictures and landscapes she\r\nhas represented Italian motives almost exclusively. Among these are her\r\nviews of Venice and other South Italian sketches, which are also the\r\nsubjects of some of her etchings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BELLE, MLLE. ANDRÉE.</b> Member of the Société Nationale des Beaux Arts.\r\nBorn in Paris. Pupil of Cazin. Paints in oils and pastels, landscapes\r\nespecially, of which she exhibited seventeen in June, 1902. The larger\r\npart of these were landscape portraits, so to speak, as they were done on\r\nthe spots represented with faithfulness to detail. The subjects were\r\npleasing, and the various hours of day, with characteristic lighting,\r\nunusually well rendered.\r\n\r\nAt the Salon des Beaux Arts, 1902, this artist exhibited a large pastel,\r\n\"A Halt at St. Mammès\" and a \"Souvenir of Bormes,\" showing the tomb of\r\nCazin. In 1903 she exhibited a pastel called \"Calvary,\" now in the Museum\r\nat Amiens, which has been praised for its harmony of color and the\r\nmanner in which the rainbow is represented. Her pictures of \"Twilight\"\r\nand \"Sunset\" are unusually successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BENATO-BELTRAMI, ELISABETTA.</b> Painter and sculptor of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, living in Padua since 1858. Her talent, which showed itself\r\nearly, was first developed by an unknown painter named Soldan, and later\r\nat the Royal Academy in Venice. She made copies of Guido, Sassoferrato\r\nand Veronese, the Laokoon group, and the Hercules of Canova, and executed\r\na much-admired bas-relief called \"Love and Innocence.\" Among her original\r\npaintings are an \"Atala and Chactas,\" \"Petrarch's First Meeting with\r\nLaura,\" a \"Descent from the Cross\" for the church at Tribano, a \"St.\r\nSebastian,\" \"Melancholy,\" a \"St. Ciro,\" and many Madonnas.

In the Exposition of 1876 at Madrid \"The Guardian\" was shown,\r\nand in 1881 a large canvas representing \"The First Step.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BERNHARDT, SARAH.</b> In 1869 this famous actress watched\r\nMathieu-Meusnier making a bust. She made her criticisms and they were\r\nalways just. The sculptor told her that she had the eye of an artist and\r\nshould use her talent in sculpture. Not long after she brought to him a\r\nmedallion portrait of her aunt. So good was it that Mathieu-Meusnier\r\nseriously encouraged her to persevere in her art. She was fascinated by\r\nthe thought of what might be possible for her, took a studio, and sent\r\nto the Salon in 1875 a bust, which attracted much attention. In 1876 she\r\nexhibited \"After the Tempest,\" the subject taken from the story of a poor\r\nwoman who, having buried two sons, saw the body of her last boy washed\r\nashore after a storm. This work was marvellously effective, and a great\r\nfuture as a sculptress was foretold for the \"divine Sara.\" At the Salon\r\nof 1878 she exhibited two portrait busts in bronze.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable woman is a painter also, and exhibited a picture called\r\n\"La jeune Fille et la Mort.\" One critic wrote of it: \"Sarah's picture\r\nshows very considerable feeling for color and more thought than the vast\r\nmajority of modern paintings. The envious and evil speakers, who always\r\nwant to say nasty things, pretend to trace in the picture very frequent\r\ntouches of Alfred Stevens, who has been Sarah's master in painting, as\r\nMathieu-Meusnier was in sculpture. However that may be, Sarah has posed\r\nher figures admirably and her coloring is excellent. It is worthy of\r\nnotice that, being as yet a comparative beginner, she has not attempted\r\nto give any expression to the features of the young girl over whose\r\nshoulder Death is peeping.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the numerous ephemeral journals which the young and old jeunesse\r\nof the Latin Quarter is constantly creating has made a very clever\r\ncaricature of the picture in a sort of Pompeian style. Death is\r\nrepresented by the grinning figure of Coquelin ainé. The legend is \"'La\r\nJeune Fille et la Mort,' or Coquelin ainé, presenting Sarah Bernhardt the\r\nbill of costs of her fugue.\" In other words, Coquelin is Death, handing\r\nto Sarah the undertaker's bill--300,000 francs--for her civil burial at\r\nthe Comédie Française.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BETHUNE, LOUISE.</b> This architect, whose maiden name was Blanchard,\r\nwas born in Waterloo, New York, 1856. She studied drawing and\r\narchitecture, and in 1881 opened an office, being the first woman\r\narchitect in the United States. Since her marriage to Robert A. Bethune\r\nthey have practised their art together. Mrs. Bethune is the only woman\r\nholding a fellowship in the American Institute of Architects.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BEVERIDGE, KÜHNE.</b> Honorable mention in Paris twice. Born in\r\nSpringfield, Illinois. Studied under William R. O'Donovan in New York,\r\nand under Rodin in Paris.\r\n\r\nAmong her works are a statue called \"Rhodesia,\" \"Rough Rider Monument,\" a\r\nstatue called \"Lascire,\" which belongs to Dr. Jameson, busts of Cecil\r\nRhodes, King Edward VII., Grover Cleveland, Vice-President Stevenson,\r\nJoseph Jefferson, Buffalo Bill, General Mahon, hero of Mafeking, Thomas\r\nL. Johnson, and many others.\r\n\r\nMiss Beveridge was first noticed as an artist in this country in 1892,\r\nwhen her busts of ex-President Cleveland and Mr. Jefferson called\r\nfavorable attention to her.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 she married Charles Coghlan, and soon discovered that he had a\r\nliving wife at the time of her marriage and obtained a divorce. Before\r\nshe went to South Africa Miss Beveridge had executed several commissions\r\nfor Cecil Rhodes and others living in that country.\r\n\r\nHer mother is now the Countess von Wrede, her home being in Europe,\r\nwhere her daughter has spent much time. She has married the second time,\r\nan American, Mr. Branson, who resides at Johannesburg, in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BIFFIN, SARAH.</b> 1784-1850. It seems a curious fact that several\r\npersons born without arms and hands have become reputable artists. This\r\nminiature painter was one of these. Her first teacher, a man named Dukes,\r\npersuaded her to bind herself to live in his house and give her time to\r\nhis service for some years. Later, when the Earl of Morton made her\r\nacquaintance, he proved to her that her engagement was not legally\r\nbinding and wished her to give it up; but Miss Biffin was well treated by\r\nthe Dukes and preferred to remain with them.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Morton, however, caused her to study under Mr. Craig, and she\r\nattained wonderful excellence in her miniatures. In 1821 the Duke of\r\nSussex, on behalf of the Society of Arts, presented her with a prize\r\nmedal for one of her pictures.\r\n\r\nShe remained sixteen years with the Dukes, and during this time never\r\nreceived more than five pounds a year! After leaving them she earned a\r\ncomfortable income. She was patronized by George III. and his successors,\r\nand Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort were her generous patrons, as\r\nwell as many other distinguished persons.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the Earl of Morton she had no other friend to aid her\r\nin getting commissions or selling her finished pictures, and she moved to\r\nLiverpool. A small annuity was purchased for her, which, in addition to\r\nthe few orders she received, supported her until her death at the age of\r\nsixty-six. Her miniatures have been seen in loan collections in recent\r\nyears. Her portrait of herself, on ivory, was exhibited in such a\r\ncollection at South Kensington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BILDERS, MARIE.</b> Family name Van Bosse. Born in Amsterdam, 1837; died\r\nin Wiesbaden, 1900. Pupil of Van de Sande-Bakhuyzen, Bosboom, and\r\nJohannes W. Bilders. Settled in Oosterbeck, and painted landscapes from\r\nviews in the neighborhood. This artist was important, and her works are\r\nadmired especially by certain Dutch artists who are famous in all\r\ncountries. These facts are well known to me from good authority, but I\r\nfail to find a list of her works or a record of their present\r\nposition.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Appendix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BILINSKA, ANNA.</b> Received the small gold medal at Berlin in 1891, and\r\nwon distinguished recognition at other international exhibitions in\r\nBerlin and Munich by her portraits and figure studies. She was born in\r\nWarsaw in 1858, and died there in 1893. She studied in Paris, where she\r\nquickly became a favorite painter of aristocratic Russians and Poles. Her\r\npictures are strong and of brilliant technique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BIONDI, NICOLA.</b> Born at Capua, 1866. This promising young Italian\r\npainter was a pupil of the Institute of Fine Arts in Naples. One of her\r\npictures, called \"Una partita,\" was exhibited at Naples and attracted\r\nmuch attention. It was purchased by Duke Martini. Another, \"Ultima\r\nProva,\" was exhibited in Rome and favorably noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BLAU, TINA.</b> Honorable mention in Paris, 1883, for her \"Spring in\r\nthe Prater.\" Her \"Land Party\" is in the possession of the Emperor of\r\nAustria, and \"In Spring-time\" belongs to the Prince Regent of Bavaria.\r\nThis talented landscape painter was born in Vienna, 1847. She was a pupil\r\nof Schäffer in Vienna, and of W. Lindenschmitt in Munich. After\r\ntravelling in Austria, Holland, and Italy, she followed her predilection\r\nfor landscape, and chose her themes in great part from those countries.\r\nIn 1884 she married Heinrich Lang, painter of battle scenes (who died in\r\n1891), and she now works alternately in Munich and Vienna. In 1890 she\r\ngave an exhibition of her pictures in Munich; they were thought to show\r\ngreat vigor of composition and color and much delicacy of artistic\r\nperception. Her foreign scenes, especially, are characterized by unusual\r\nlocal truth and color. Among her best works are \"Studies from the Prater\r\nin Vienna,\" \"Canal at Amsterdam,\" \"Harvest Day in Holland,\" \"The Arch of\r\nTitus in Rome,\" \"Street in Venice,\" and \"Late Summer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BLOCH, MME.

Pupil of\r\nChapu. She first exhibited at the Salon of 1878, a medallion portrait of\r\nM. Bloch; this was followed by \"Hope,\" the \"Golden Age,\" \"Virginius\r\nSacrificing his Daughter,\" \"Moses Receiving the Tables of the Law,\" etc.\r\nMme. Bloch has made numerous portrait busts, among them being the kings\r\nof Spain and Portugal, Buffalo Bill, C. Flammarion, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the Salon of the Artistes Français, 1903, Mme. Bloch exhibited a\r\n\"Portrait of M. Frédéric Passy, Member of the Institute.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BOCCARDO, LINA ZERBINAH.</b> Rome.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BOEMM, RITTA.</b> A Hungarian artist. Has been much talked of in\r\nDresden. She certainly possesses distinguished talents, and is easily in\r\nthe front rank of Dresden women artists. Her gouache pictures dealing\r\nwith Hungarian subjects, a \"Village Street,\" a \"Peasant Farm,\" a\r\n\"Churchyard,\" exhibited at Dresden in 1892, were well drawn and full of\r\nsentiment, but lacking in color sense and power. She works unevenly and\r\nseems pleased when she succeeds in setting a scene cleverly. She paints\r\nportraits also, mostly in pastel, which are spirited, but not especially\r\ngood likenesses. What she can do in the way of color may be seen in her\r\n\"Village Street in Winter,\" a picture of moderate size, in which the\r\nlight is exquisite; unfortunately most of her painting is less admirable\r\nthan this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BOISSONNAS, MME. CAROLINE SORDET.</b> Honorable mention at the Salon of\r\nLyons, 1897. Member of the Exposition Permanente Amis des Beaux-Arts,\r\nGeneva. Born in Geneva. Pupil of the School of Fine Arts, Geneva, under\r\nProf. F. Gillet and M. E. Ravel.\r\n\r\nThis artist paints portraits principally. She has been successful, and\r\nher pictures are in Geneva, Lausanne, Vevey, Paris, Lyons, Marseilles,\r\nDresden, Naples, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BOMPIANI-BATTAGLIA, CLELIA.</b> Born in Rome, 1847. Pupil of her\r\nfather, Roberto Bompiani, and of the professors in the Academy of St.\r\nLuke. The following pictures in water-colors have established her\r\nreputation as an artist: \"Confidential Communication,\" 1885; the\r\n\"Fortune-Teller,\" 1887; \"A Public Copyist,\" 1888; and \"The Wooing,\" 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BONHEUR, JULIETTE--MME. PEYROL.</b> Born at Paris. Sister of Rosa\r\nBonheur, and a pupil of her father. Among her pictures are \"A Flock of\r\nGeese,\" \"A Flock of Sheep Lying Down,\" and kindred subjects. The\r\nlast-named work was much remarked at the Salon of 1875. In 1878 she\r\nexhibited \"The Pool\" and \"The Mother's Kiss.\"\r\n\r\nMme. Peyrol was associated with her famous sister in the conduct of the\r\nFree School of Design, founded by Rosa Bonheur in 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BONHEUR, MARIE ROSALIE.</b> 1822-99. Member of Antwerp Institute, 1868.\r\nSalon medals, 1845, 1848, 1855, 1867; Legion of Honor, 1865; Leopold\r\nCross, 1880; Commander's Cross, Royal Order of Isabella the Catholic,\r\n1880. Born in Bordeaux. She was taught drawing by her father, who,\r\nperceiving that she had unusual talent, permitted her to give up\r\ndressmaking, to which, much against her will, she had been apprenticed.\r\nFrom 1855 her fame was established; she was greatly appreciated, and her\r\nworks competed for in England and the United States, as well as in\r\nEuropean countries.\r\n\r\nHer chief merit is the actual truthfulness with which she represented\r\nanimals. Her skies might be bettered in some cases--the atmosphere of her\r\npictures was sometimes open to question--but her animals were\r\nanatomically perfect and handled with such virility as few men have\r\nexcelled or even equalled. Her position as an artist is so established\r\nthat no quoted opinions are needed when speaking of her--she was one of\r\nthe most famous women of her century.\r\n\r\nHer home at By was near Fontainebleau, where she lived quietly, and for\r\nsome years held gratuitous classes for drawing. She left, at her death, a\r\ncollection of pictures, studies, etchings, etc., which were sold by\r\nauction in Paris soon after.\r\n\r\nHer \"Ploughing in the Nivernais,\" 1848, is in the Luxembourg Gallery;\r\n\"The Horse Fair,\" 1853, is seen in the National Gallery, London, in a\r\nreplica, the original being in the United States, purchased by the late\r\nA. T. Stewart. Her \"Hay Harvest in the Auvergne,\" 1855, is one of her\r\nmost important works. After 1867 Mlle. Bonheur did not exhibit at the\r\nSalon until 1899, a few weeks before her death.\r\n\r\nOne must pay a tribute to this artist as a good and generous woman. She\r\nfounded the Free School of Design for Girls, and in 1849 took the\r\ndirection of it and devoted much of her valuable time to its interests.\r\nHow valuable an hour was to her we may understand when we remember that\r\nHamerton says: \"I have seen work of hers which, according to the price\r\ngiven, must have paid her a hundred pounds for each day's labor.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of her life is of great interest, and can be but slightly\r\nsketched here.\r\n\r\nShe was afoot betimes in the morning, and often walked ten or twelve\r\nmiles and worked hard all day. The difficulty of reaching her models\r\nproved such a hindrance to her that she conceived the idea of visiting\r\nthe abattoirs, where she could see animals living and dead and study\r\ntheir anatomy.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to imagine all the difficulties she encountered in doing\r\nthis--the many repulsive features of such places--while the company of\r\ndrovers and butchers made one of the disagreeables of her pursuits. Her\r\nlove for the animals, too, made it doubly hard for her to see them in the\r\ndeath agony and listen to their pitiful cries for freedom.\r\n\r\nIn all this experience, however, she met no rude or unkind treatment. Her\r\ndrawings won the admiration of the men who watched her make them and they\r\ntreated her with respect. She pursued her studies in the same manner in\r\nthe stables of the Veterinary School at Alfort and in the Jardin des\r\nPlantes.\r\n\r\nAt other times she studied in the country the quiet grazing herds, and,\r\nthough often mistaken for a boy on account of the dress she wore, she\r\ninspired only admiration for her simplicity and frankness of manner,\r\nwhile the graziers and horse-dealers respectfully regarded her and\r\nwondered at her skill in picturing their favorite animals. Some very\r\namusing stories might be told of her comical embarrassments in her\r\ncountry rambles, when she was determined to preserve her disguise and the\r\npretty girls were equally determined to make love to her!\r\n\r\nAside from all this laborious study of living animals, she obtained\r\nportions of dead creatures for dissection; also moulds, casts, and\r\nillustrated anatomical books; and, in short, she left no means untried\r\nby which she could perfect herself in the specialty she had chosen. Her\r\ndevotion to study and to the practice of her art was untiring, and only\r\nthe most engrossing interest in it and an indomitable perseverance,\r\nsupplemented and supported by a physically and morally healthful\r\norganization, could have sustained the nervous strain of her life from\r\nthe day when she was first allowed to follow her vocation to the time\r\nwhen she placed herself in the front rank of animal painters.\r\n\r\nA most charming picture is drawn of the life of the Bonheur family in the\r\nyears when Rosa was making her progressive steps. They lived in an humble\r\nhouse in the Rue Rumfort, the father, Auguste, Isidore, and Rosa all\r\nworking in the same studio. She had many birds and a pet sheep. As the\r\napartment of the Bonheurs was on the sixth floor, this sheep lived on the\r\nleads, and from time to time Isidore bore him on his shoulders down all\r\nthe stairs to the neighboring square, where the animal could browse on\r\nthe real grass, and afterward be carried back by one of the devoted\r\nbrothers of his mistress. They were very poor, but they were equally\r\nhappy. At evening Rosa made small models or illustrations for books or\r\nalbums, which the dealers readily bought, and by this means she added to\r\nthe family store for needs or pleasures.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, when Rosa was nineteen years old, she first experienced the\r\npleasures, doubts, and fears attendant upon a public exhibition of one's\r\nwork. Two small pictures, called \"Goats and Sheep\" and \"Two Rabbits,\"\r\nwere hung at the Salon and were praised by critics and connoisseurs. The\r\nnext year she sent three others, \"Animals in a Pasture,\" \"A Cow Lying in\r\na Meadow,\" and \"A Horse for Sale.\" She continued to send pictures to the\r\nSalon and to some exhibitions in other cities, and received several\r\nbronze and silver medals.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 she sent twelve works to the Salon, accompanied by those of her\r\nfather and her brother Auguste, who was admitted that year for the first\r\ntime. In 1848 Isidore was added to the list, exhibiting a picture and a\r\ngroup in marble, both representing \"A Combat between a Lioness and an\r\nAfrican Horseman.\" And, finally, the family contributions were completed\r\nwhen Juliette, now Madame Peyrol, added her pictures, and the works of\r\nthe five artists were seen in the same Exhibition.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Rosa Bonheur's \"Cantal Oxen\" was awarded the gold medal, and was\r\nfollowed by \"Ploughing in the Nivernais,\" so well known the world over by\r\nengravings and photographs. When the medal was assigned her, Horace\r\nVernet proclaimed her triumph to a brilliant assemblage, and also\r\npresented to her a magnificent vase of Sèvres porcelain, in the name of\r\nthe French Government. This placed her in the first rank of living\r\nartists, and the triumph was of double value to her on account of the\r\nhappiness it afforded her father, to see this, his oldest child, of whose\r\nfuture he had often despaired, taking so eminent a place in the artistic\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThis year of success was also a year of sorrow, for before its end the\r\nold Raymond had died. He had been for some time the director of the\r\nGovernment School of Design for Girls, and, being freed from pecuniary\r\nanxiety, he had worked with new courage and hope. After her father's\r\ndeath Rosa Bonheur exhibited nothing for two years, but in 1853 she\r\nbrought out her \"Horse Fair,\" which added to her fame.\r\n\r\nShe was perfectly at home in the mountains, and spent much time in the\r\nhuts of charcoal burners, huntsmen, or woodcutters, contented with the\r\nfood they could give her and happy in her study. Thus she made her\r\nsketches for \"Morning in the Highlands,\" \"The Denizens of the Mountains,\"\r\netc. She once lived six weeks with her party on the Spanish side of the\r\nPyrenees, where they saw no one save muleteers going and coming, with\r\ntheir long lines of loaded mules. Their only food was frogs' legs, which\r\nthey prepared themselves, and the black bread and curdled milk which the\r\ncountry afforded. At evening the muleteers would amuse the strangers by\r\ndancing the national dances, and then repose in picturesque groups just\r\nsuited to artistic sketching. In Scotland and in Switzerland, as well as\r\nin various portions of her own country, she had similar experiences, and\r\nher \"Hay-Making in Auvergne\" proves that she was familiar with the more\r\nusual phases of country life. At the Knowles sale in London, in 1865, her\r\npicture of \"Spanish Muleteers Crossing the Pyrenees,\" one of the results\r\nof the above sojourn in these mountains, sold for two thousand guineas,\r\nabout ten thousand dollars. I believe that, in spite of the large sums of\r\nmoney that she received, her habitual generosity and indifference to\r\nwealth prevented her amassing a large fortune, but her fame as an artist\r\nand her womanly virtues brought the rewards which she valued above\r\nanything that wealth could bestow--such rewards as will endure through\r\ncenturies and surround the name of Rosa Bonheur with glory, rewards which\r\nshe untiringly labored to attain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BONSALL, ELIZABETH F.</b> First Toppan prize, and Mary Smith prize\r\ntwice, at Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.

She illustrated the\r\n\"Fireside Sphinx,\" by Agnes Repplier. Her picture of \"Hot Milk\" is in the\r\nPennsylvania Academy; her \"Suspense,\" in a private gallery in New York.\r\n\r\nAn interesting chapter in Miss Winslow's book, \"Concerning Cats,\" is\r\ncalled \"Concerning Cat Artists,\" in which she writes: \"Elizabeth Bonsall\r\nis a young American artist who has exhibited some good cat pictures, and\r\nwhose work promises to make her famous some day if she does not 'weary in\r\nwell-doing.'\"\r\n\r\nMiss Bonsall has prepared a \"Cat Calendar\" and a \"Child's Book about\r\nCats,\" which were promised to appear in the autumn of 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BONSALL, MARY M.</b> First Toppan prize at Pennsylvania Academy of Fine\r\nArts.

Studied at above academy\r\nunder Vonnoh, De Camp, William Chase, and Cecilia Beaux.\r\n\r\nThis artist paints portraits, which are in private hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BONTE, PAULA.</b> Born in Magdeburg, 1840, and from 1862 to 1864 was a\r\npupil of Pape in Berlin. She travelled and studied in Northern Italy and\r\nSwitzerland, and from these regions, as well as from Northern Germany,\r\ntook her subjects. She has exhibited pictures at various exhibitions, and\r\namong her best works should be mentioned: \"The Beach at Clovelly in\r\nDevonshire,\" \"From the Bernese Oberland,\" \"The Riemenstalden Valley,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BOOTT, ELIZABETH.</b> Born in Cambridge. Miss Boott was one of those\r\npupils of William M. Hunt to whom he imparted a wonderful artistic\r\nenthusiasm, energy, and devotion. After studying in Boston she studied in\r\nParis under Duveneck--whom she afterward married--and under Couture. Her\r\nsubjects were genre, still-life, and flowers, and were well considered.\r\nAmong her genre pictures are \"An Old Man Reading,\" an \"Old Roman\r\nPeasant,\" and a \"Girl with a Cat.\" When in Italy she painted a number of\r\nportraits, which were successful. Miss Brewster, who lived in Rome, was\r\nan excellent critic, and she wrote: \"I must say a few words about a\r\nstudio I have lately visited--Miss Boott's. I saw there three very fine\r\nportraits, remarkable for strength and character, as well as rich\r\ncoloring: one of Mr. Boott, one of Bishop Say, and the third of T.\r\nAdolphus Trollope, the well-known writer and brother of the novelist,\r\nAnthony Trollope. All are good likenesses and are painted with vigor and\r\nskill, but the one of Mr. Trollope is especially clever. Trollope's head\r\nand face, though a good study, are not easy to paint, but Miss Boott has\r\nsucceeded to perfection. His head and beard are very fine. The face in\r\nnature, but for the melancholy, kindly look about the eyes and mouth,\r\nwould be stern; Miss Boott has caught this expression and yet retained\r\nall the firm character of the countenance. It is remarkable that an\r\nartist who paints male heads with such a vigorous character should also\r\ngive to flowers softness, transparency, and grace. Nothing can be more\r\nlovely than Miss Boott's flower studies. She has some delicious poppies\r\namong wheat, lilies, thistles. She gets a transparency into these works\r\nthat is not facile in oil. A bunch of roses in a vase was as tender and\r\nround and soft-colored as in nature. Among all the many studios of Rome I\r\ndo not know a more attractive one than Miss Boott's.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BORTOLAN, ROSA.</b> Born at Treviso. She was placed in the Academy at\r\nVenice by her family, where she had the benefit of such masters as\r\nGrigoletti, Lipparini, Schiavoni, and Zandomeneghi. She early showed much\r\noriginality, and after making thorough preliminary studies she began to\r\nfollow her own ideas. She was of a mystical and contemplative turn of\r\nmind, and a great proportion of her work has been of a religious nature.\r\nHer pictures began to attract attention about 1847, and she had many\r\ncommissions for altar-pieces and similar work. The church of\r\nValdobbiadene, at Venice, contains \"San Venanziano Fortunatus, Bishop.\"\r\n\"Saint Louis\" was painted as a commission of Brandolin da Pieve; \"Comte\r\nJustinian Replying to Bonaparte in Treviso\" was a subscription picture\r\npresented to Signor Zoccoletto. Portraits of the Countess\r\nCanossa-Portalupi and her son, of Luigia Codemo, and of Luigi Giacomelli\r\nare thought to possess great merit; while those of Dr. Pasquali (in the\r\nPicture Gallery at Treviso) and Michelangelo Codemo have been judged\r\nsuperior to those of Rosalba Carriera and Angelica Kauffmann. Her sacred\r\npictures, strong and good in color, are full of a mystical and spiritual\r\nbeauty. Her drawing is admirable and her treatment of detail highly\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BORZINO, LEOPOLDINA.</b> Milanese water-color painter. Has shown\r\nexcellent genre pictures at various exhibitions. \"The Holiday\" and the\r\n\"Return from Mass\" were both exhibited and sold at Rome in 1883; \"The Way\r\nto Calvary\" was seen at Venice in 1887. \"The Rosary,\" \"Anguish,\" and\r\n\"Going to the Fountain\" are all distinguished by good color as well as by\r\ngrace and originality of composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BOUGUEREAU, MME.

The \"Madonna of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\" was painted on\r\na commission from the Bishop of Piacenza, who presented it to Pope Pius\r\nIX.; after being exhibited at the Vatican, it was sent to the Bishop of\r\nJesi, for the church of Castelplanio. Other celebrated works of hers are\r\na \"Holy Family,\" the \"Madonna of Lourdes,\" and several copies of the \"Viâ\r\nCrucis,\" by Viganoni.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 this artist entered the Ursuline Convent at Piacenza, where she\r\ncontinues to paint religious pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BRACKEN, JULIA M.</b> First prize for sculpture, Chicago, 1898;\r\nappointed on staff of sculptors for the St. Louis Exposition. Member of\r\nArts Club, Western Society of Artists, Municipal Art League, and Krayle\r\nWorkshop, Chicago. Born at Apple River, Ill., 1871. Pupil of Chicago Art\r\nInstitute. Acted as assistant to Lorado Taft, 1887-92. Was much occupied\r\nwith the decorations for the Columbian Exposition, and executed on an\r\nindependent commission the statue of \"Illinois Welcoming the Nations.\"\r\nThere are to be five portrait statues placed in front of the Educational\r\nBuilding at St. Louis, each to be executed by a well-known artist. One of\r\nthese is to be the work of Miss Bracken, who is the only woman among\r\nthem. Miss Bracken has modelled an heroic portrait statue of President\r\nMonroe; beside the figure is a globe, on which he points out the junction\r\nof the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BRACQUEMOND, MME. MARIE.</b> Pupil of Ingres. A portrait painter, also\r\npainter of genre subjects. At the Salon of 1875 she exhibited \"The\r\nReading\"; in 1874 \"Marguerite.\" She has been much occupied in the\r\ndecoration of the Haviland faience, a branch of these works, at Auteuil,\r\nbeing at one time in charge of her husband, Félix Bracquemond. In 1872 M.\r\nBracquemond was esteemed the first ceramic artist in France. An eminent\r\nFrench critic said of M. and Mme. Bracquemond: \"You cannot praise too\r\nhighly these two artists, who are as agreeable and as clever as they are\r\ntalented and esteemed.\"\r\n\r\nMme. Bracquemond had the faculty of employing the faience colors so well\r\nthat she produced a clearness and richness not attained by other artists.\r\nThe progress made in the Haviland faience in the seventies was very\r\nlargely due to Mme. Bracquemond, whose pieces were almost always sold\r\nfrom the atelier before being fired, so great was her success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BRANDEIS, ANTOINETTA.</b> Many prizes at the Academy of Venice. Born of\r\nBohemian parents in Miscova, Galitza, 1849. Pupil of Iavurek, of Prague,\r\nin the beginning of her studies, but her father dying and her mother\r\nmarrying again, she was taken to Venice, where she studied in the Academy\r\nseveral years under Grigoletti, Moja, Bresolin, Nani, and Molmenti.\r\nAlthough all her artistic training was received in Italy and she made\r\nher first successes there, most of her works have been exhibited in\r\nLondon, under the impression that she was better understood in England.\r\n\r\nAnnoyed by the commendation of her pictures \"as the work of a woman,\" she\r\nsigned a number of her canvases Antonio Brandeis. Although she painted\r\nreligious subjects for churches, her special predilection is for views of\r\nVenice, preferably those in which the gondola appears. She has studied\r\nthese in their every detail. \"Il canale Traghetto de' San Geremia\" is in\r\nthe Museum Rivoltella at Trieste. This and \"Il canale dell' Abbazia della\r\nMisericordia\" have been much commended by foreign critics, especially the\r\nEnglish and Austrians. Other Venetian pictures are \"La Chiese della\r\nSalute,\" \"Il canale de' Canalregio,\" and \"La Pescaria.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BRESLAU, LOUISA CATHERINE.</b> Gold medal at Paris Exposition, 1889;\r\ngold medal at Paris Exposition, 1900. Chevalier of the Legion of Honor,\r\n1901. Member of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. A Swiss artist, who\r\nmade her studies at the Julian Academy under Robert-Fleury.\r\n\r\nShe has painted many portraits. Her picture \"Under the Apple-Tree\" is in\r\nthe Museum at Lausanne; the \"Little Girls\" or \"The Sisters\" and the\r\n\"Child Dreamer\"--exhibited at Salon, 1902--are in the Gallery of the\r\nLuxembourg; the \"Gamins,\" in the Museum at Carpentras; the \"Tea Party,\"\r\nat the Ministry of the Interior, Paris.\r\n\r\nAt the Salon of 1902 Mlle. Breslau exhibited six pictures, among which\r\nwere landscapes, two representing September and October at Saint-Cloud;\r\ntwo of fruit and flowers; all of which were admired, while the \"Dreamer\"\r\nwas honored with a place in the Luxembourg. In the same Salon she\r\nexhibited six pictures in pastel: four portraits, and heads of a gamin\r\nand of a little girl. The portrait of Margot is an ideal picture of a\r\nhappy child, seated at a table, resting her head on her left hand while\r\nwith the right she turns the leaves of a book. A toy chicken and a doll\r\nare on the table beside her. In the Salon of 1903 she exhibited five\r\npictures of flowers and another called the \"Child with Long Hair.\"\r\n\r\nI was first interested in this artist by the frequent references to her\r\nand her work in the journal of Marie Bashkirtseff. They were\r\nfellow-pupils in the Julian Academy. Soon after she began her studies\r\nthere Marie Bashkirtseff writes: \"Breslau has been working at the studio\r\ntwo years, and she is twenty; I am seventeen, but Breslau had taken\r\nlessons for a long time before coming here.... How well that Breslau\r\ndraws!\"\r\n\r\n\"That miserable Breslau has composed a picture, 'Monday Morning, or the\r\nChoice of a Model.' Every one belonging to the studio is in it--Julian\r\nstanding between Amalie and me. It is correctly done, the perspective is\r\ngood, the likenesses--everything. When one can do a thing like that, one\r\ncannot fail to become a great artist. You have guessed it, have you not?\r\nI am jealous. That is well, for it will serve as a stimulus to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am jealous of Breslau. She does not draw at all like a woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am terrified when I think of the future that awaits Breslau; it fills\r\nme with wonder and sadness. In her compositions there is nothing\r\nwomanish, commonplace, or disproportioned. She will attract attention at\r\nthe Salon, for, in addition to her treatment of it, the subject itself\r\nwill not be a common one.\"\r\n\r\nThe above prophecy has been generously fulfilled. Mlle. Breslau is indeed\r\na poet in her ability to picture youth and its sweet intimacies, and she\r\ndoes this so easily. With a touch she reveals the grace of one and the\r\naffectations of another subject of her brush, and skilfully renders the\r\nvarying emotions in the faces of her pictures. Pleasure and suffering,\r\nthe fleeting thought of the child, the agitation of the young girl are\r\nall depicted with rare truthfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BREWSTER, ADA AUGUSTA.</b>\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BRICKDALE, MISS ELEANOR FORTESCUE.</b>\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BRICCI OR BRIZIO, PLAUTILLA.</b> Very little is known of this Roman\r\nartist of the seventeenth century, but that little marks her as an\r\nunusually gifted woman, since she was a practical architect and a painter\r\nof pictures. She was associated with her brother in some architectural\r\nworks in and near Rome, and was the only woman of her time in this\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nShe is believed to have erected a small palace near the Porta San\r\nPancrazio, unaided by her brother, and is credited with having designed\r\nin the Church of San Luigi de' Francesi the third chapel on the left\r\naisle, dedicated to St. Louis, and with having also painted the\r\naltar-piece in this chapel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BRIDGES, FIDELIA.</b> Associate of the National Academy of Design in\r\n1878, when but three other women were thus honored.

Her subjects were landscapes and\r\nflowers. In 1871 she first painted in water-colors, which suited many of\r\nher pictures better than oils. She was elected a member of the\r\nWater-Color Society in 1875. To the Philadelphia Exposition, 1876, she\r\nsent a \"Kingfisher and Catkins,\" a \"Flock of Snow Birds,\" and the \"Corner\r\nof a Rye-Field.\" Of the last a writer in the _Art Journal_ said: \"Miss\r\nBridges' 'Edge of a Rye-Field,' with a foreground of roses and weeds, is\r\na close study, and shows that she is as happy in the handling of oil\r\ncolors as in those mixed with water.\"\r\n\r\nAnother critic wrote: \"Her works are like little lyric poems, and she\r\ndwells with loving touches on each of her buds, 'like blossoms atilt'\r\namong the leaves.\"\r\n\r\nHer pictures are in private collections, and are much valued by their\r\nowners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BROOKS, MARIA.</b>\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BROWNSCOMBE, JENNIE.</b> Pupil of the National Academy and the Art\r\nStudents' League, New York, and of Henry Mosler in Paris.\r\n\r\nPaints genre subjects, among which are: \"Love's Young Dream,\" \"Colonial\r\nMinuet,\" \"Sir Roger de Coverly at Carvel Hall,\" \"Battle of Roses,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe works of this artist have been reproduced in engravings and etchings,\r\nand are well known in black and white.

Born in Newark,\r\nNew Jersey. Pupil of Miss Kate Greatorex; of Carleton Wiggins, New York;\r\nof the Julian Academy, Paris; of H. S. Birbing in Holland, and of Jules\r\nDupré on the coast of France. When a child this artist lived very near\r\nThomas Moran and was allowed to spend much time in his studio, where she\r\nlearned the use of colors.\r\n\r\nShe exhibited her first picture at the National Academy of Design when\r\ntwelve years old, and has been a constant contributor to its exhibitions\r\nsince that time; also to the exhibitions of the American Water-Color\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nHer earliest pictures were of flowers, and during several years she had\r\nno teacher. At length she decided to study battle painting, and, after a\r\nsummer under Carleton Wiggins, she went abroad, in 1890, and remained two\r\nyears, painting in the schools in winter and out of doors in summer. Miss\r\nBrowne exhibited at the Salon des Beaux-Arts in 1890, and many of her\r\nworks have been seen in exhibits in this country. The Dodge prize was\r\nawarded to a picture called \"The Last Load,\" and the Hallgarten prize to\r\n\"Repose,\" a moonlight scene with cattle. Her pictures are in private\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BROWN, MRS. AGNES--MRS. JOHN APPLETON BROWN.</b> Born in Newburyport.\r\nThis artist paints in oils. Her subjects are landscapes, flowers, and\r\nstill life. She has also painted cats successfully.\r\n\r\nI have a winter landscape by Mrs. Brown which is unusually attractive and\r\nis often admired. She sends her works to the exhibitions of the Boston\r\nArt Club and to some exhibitions in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BROWNE, MME. HENRIETTE.</b> Born at Paris; 1829-1901. Pupil of Chaplin.\r\nThe family name of this artist was Bouteiller, and she married M. Jules\r\nde Saux, but as an artist used the name of an ancestress. Her pictures of\r\ngenre subjects very early attracted attention, especially in 1855, when\r\nshe sent to the Salon \"A Brother of the Christian School,\" \"School for\r\nthe Poor at Aix,\" \"Mutual Instruction,\" and \"Rabbits.\" Her works were\r\npopular and brought good prices. In 1868 \"The Sisters of Charity\" sold\r\nfor £1,320.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 she exhibited \"A Grandmother\" and \"Convalescence.\" Her Oriental\r\nscenes were much admired. Among these were \"A Court in Damascus,\" \"Nubian\r\nDancing Girls,\" and a \"Harem in Constantinople.\" Mme. Browne was also\r\nskilful as an engraver.\r\n\r\nT. Chasrel wrote in _L'Art_: \"Her touch without over-minuteness has the\r\ndelicacy and security of a fine work of the needle. The accent is just\r\nwithout that seeking for virile energy which too often spoils the most\r\ncharming qualities. The sentiment is discreet without losing its\r\nintensity in order to attract public notice. The painting of Mme.\r\nHenriette Browne is at an equal distance from grandeur and insipidity,\r\nfrom power and affectation, and gathers from the just balance of her\r\nnature some effects of taste and charm of which a parvenu in art would be\r\nincapable.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Rev. Charles Kingsley wrote of the picture of the \"Sisters of\r\nCharity,\" of the sale of which I have spoken, as follows: \"The picture\r\nwhich is the best modern instance of this happy hitting of this golden\r\nmean, whereby beauty and homely fact are perfectly combined, is in my\r\neyes Henrietta Browne's picture of the 'Sick Child and the Sisters of\r\nCharity.' I know not how better to show that it is easy to be at once\r\nbeautiful and true, if one only knows how, than by describing that\r\npicture. Criticise it, I dare not; for I believe that it will surely be\r\nranked hereafter among the very highest works of modern art. If I find no\r\nfault in it, it is because I have none to find; because the first sight\r\nof the picture produced in me instantaneous content and confidence. There\r\nwas nothing left to wish for, nothing to argue about. The thing was what\r\nit ought to be, and neither more nor less, and I could look on it, not as\r\na critic, but as a learner only.\"\r\n\r\nThis is praise indeed from an Englishman writing of a Frenchwoman's\r\npicture--an Englishman with no temptation to say what he did not think;\r\nand we may accept his words as the exact expression of the effect the\r\npicture made on him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BRUNE, MME.

She worked as an amateur some years, first\r\nexhibiting at the Academy in 1873 her picture called \"Missing,\" which was\r\npraised; but the \"Roll-Call,\" of the following year, placed her in the\r\nfront rank of the Academy exhibitors. It was purchased by the Queen and\r\nhung in Windsor Castle. She next exhibited the \"Twenty-Eighth Regiment at\r\nQuatre Bras,\" the \"Return from Inkerman,\" purchased by the Fine Art\r\nSociety for £3,000. This was followed by kindred subjects.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Lady Butler exhibited \"Evicted,\" in 1891 the \"Camel Corps,\" in\r\n1892 \"Halt in a Forced March,\" in 1895 the \"Dawn of Waterloo,\" in 1896\r\n\"Steady the Drums and Fifes,\" in 1902 \"Tent Pegging in India,\" in 1903\r\n\"Within Sound of the Guns.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1869 she painted a religious picture called the \"Magnificat.\" In\r\nwater-colors she has painted \"Sketches in Tuscany\" and several pictures\r\nof soldiers, among which are \"Scot's Grays Advancing\" and \"Cavalry at a\r\nGallop.\"\r\n\r\nLady Butler has recently appeared as an author, publishing \"Letters from\r\nthe Holy Land,\" illustrated by sixteen most attractive drawings in\r\ncolors. The _Spectator_ says: \"Lady Butler's letters and diary, the\r\noutcome of a few weeks' journeyings in Palestine, express simply and\r\nforcibly the impressions made on a devout and cultivated mind by the\r\nscenes of the Holy Land.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1875 Ruskin wrote in \"Notes of the Academy\": \"I never approached a\r\npicture with more iniquitous prejudice against it than I did Miss\r\nThompson's--'Quatre Bras'--partly because I have always said that no\r\nwoman could paint, and secondly because I thought what the public made\r\nsuch a fuss about _must_ be good for nothing. But it is Amazon's work\r\nthis, no doubt of it, and the first fine pre-Raphaelite picture of battle\r\nwe have had; profoundly interesting, and showing all manner of\r\nillustrative and realistic faculty.... The sky is most tenderly painted,\r\nand with the truest outline of cloud of all in the Exhibition; and the\r\nterrific piece of gallant wrath and ruin on the extreme left, when the\r\ncuirassier is catching round the neck of his horse as he falls, and the\r\nconvulsed fallen horse, seen through the smoke below, is wrought through\r\nall the truth of its frantic passion with gradations of color and shade\r\nwhich I have not seen the like of since Turner's death.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Art Journal_, 1877, says: \"'Inkerman' is simply a marvellous\r\nproduction when considered as the work of a young woman who was never on\r\nthe field of battle.... No matter how many figures she brings into the\r\nscene, or how few, you may notice character in each figure, each is a\r\nsuperb study.\"\r\n\r\nHer recent picture, \"Within Sound of the Guns,\" shows a company of\r\nmounted soldiers on the confines of a river in South Africa.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CAMERON, KATHERINE.</b> Member of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters\r\nin Water-Colors; Modern Sketch Club, London; Ladies' Art Club, Glasgow.\r\nBorn in Glasgow.

It is full of action and true to the life of these\r\nhorrors as I have seen them in Madrid. Doubtless the color is brilliant,\r\nas the costumes of the toreadors are always so, and there are two in this\r\npicture. This work was displayed at the exhibition of the Royal Scottish\r\nAcademy, June, 1903--of which a writer says: \"A feeling for color has\r\nalways been predominant in the Scottish school, and it is here\r\nconspicuously displayed, together with a method of handling, be it in the\r\ndomain of figure or landscape, which is personal to the artist and not a\r\nmere academic tradition.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Studio_ of May, 1903, J.

Pupil of\r\nJulian Academy and of Courtois in Paris.\r\n\r\nThis artist's name has been made prominent by the fact of her being\r\nselected to paint a portrait of the Empress of China. Miss Carl has\r\nfrequently exhibited at the Salon. In 1902 she sent portraits in both oil\r\nand water-colors. One of these works, called \"Angelina,\" impresses one as\r\na faithful portrait of a model. She is seated and gracefully posed--the\r\nface is in a full front view, the figure turned a little to one side and\r\nnude to the waist, the hands are folded on the lap and hold a flower, a\r\ngauze-like drapery falls about the left shoulder and the arms, but does\r\nnot conceal them; the background is a brocade or tapestry curtain.\r\n\r\nI have seen a reproduction only, and cannot speak of the color. The whole\r\neffect of the picture is attractive. For the purpose of painting the\r\nportrait of the Chinese Empress, Miss Carl was assigned an apartment in\r\nthe palace.

Her copies after the Italian masters were of great\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nShe painted in oils as well as in water-colors. One of her pictures\r\nrepresents her as teaching a lady to use the brush. When we remember that\r\nCharles, who was so constantly in contact with Vandyck, could praise\r\nMistress Carlisle, we must believe her to have been a good painter.\r\n\r\nMistress Anne has sometimes been confounded with the Countess of\r\nCarlisle, who was distinguished as an engraver of the works of Salvator\r\nRosa, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CARPENTER, MARGARET SARAH.</b> The largest gold medal and other honors\r\nfrom the Society of Arts, London. Born at Salisbury, England. 1793-1872.\r\nPupil of a local artist in Salisbury when quite young. Lord Radnor's\r\nattention was called to her talent, and he permitted her to copy in the\r\ngallery of Longford Castle, and advised her sending her pictures to\r\nLondon, and later to go there herself. She made an immediate success as a\r\nportrait painter, and from 1814 during fifty-two years her pictures were\r\nannually exhibited at the Academy with a few rare exceptions.\r\n\r\nHer family name was Geddis; her husband was Keeper of the Prints and\r\nDrawings in the British Museum more than twenty years, and after his\r\ndeath his wife received a pension of £100 a year in recognition of his\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nHer portraits were considered excellent as likenesses; her touch was\r\nfirm, her color brilliant, and her works in oils and water-colors as well\r\nas her miniatures were much esteemed. Many of them were engraved. Her\r\nportrait of the sculptor Gibson is in the National Portrait Gallery,\r\nLondon. A life-size portrait of Anthony Stewart, miniature painter,\r\ncalled \"Devotion,\" and the \"Sisters,\" portraits of Mrs. Carpenter's\r\ndaughters, with a picture of \"Ockham Church,\" are at South Kensington.\r\n\r\nShe painted a great number of portraits of titled ladies which are in\r\nthe collections of their families.

Born in Venice\r\n1675-1757--and had an eventful life. Her artistic talent was first\r\nmanifested in lace-weaving, which as a child she preferred before any\r\ngames or amusements. She studied painting under several masters,\r\ntechnique under Antonio Balestra, pastel-painting with Antonio Nazari and\r\nDiamantini, and miniature painting, in which she was especially\r\ndistinguished, was taught her by her brother-in-law, Antonio Pellegrini,\r\nwhom she later accompanied to Paris and London and assisted in the\r\ndecorative works he executed there.\r\n\r\nRosalba's fame in Venice was such that she was invited to the courts of\r\nFrance and Austria, where she painted many portraits. She was honored by\r\nelection to the Academies of Rome, Bologna, and Paris.\r\n\r\nThis artist especially excelled in portraits of pretty women, while her\r\nportraits of men were well considered. Among the most important were\r\nthose of the Emperor Charles, the kings of France and Denmark, and many\r\nother distinguished persons, both men and women.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke of Tuscany asked for her own portrait for his gallery. She\r\nrepresented herself with one of her sisters. Her face is noble and most\r\nexpressive, but, like many of her pictures, while the head is spirited\r\nand characteristic, the rest of the figure and the accessories are weak.\r\nA second portrait of herself--in crayons--is in the Dresden Gallery, and\r\nis very attractive.\r\n\r\nWhile in England Rosalba painted many portraits in crayon and pastel, in\r\nwhich art she was not surpassed by any artist of her day.\r\n\r\nHer diary of two years in Paris was published in Venice. It is curious\r\nand interesting, as it sets forth the customs of society, and especially\r\nthose of artists of the period.\r\n\r\nReturning to Venice, Rosalba suffered great depression and was haunted by\r\na foreboding of calamity. She lived very quietly. In his \"Storia della\r\nPittura Veneziana,\" Zanetti writes of her at this time: \"Much of interest\r\nmay be written of this celebrated and highly gifted woman, whose spirit,\r\nin the midst of her triumphs and the brightest visions of happiness, was\r\nweighed down by the anticipation of a heavy calamity. On one occasion she\r\npainted a portrait of herself, the brow wreathed with leaves which\r\nsymbolized death. She explained this as an image of the sadness in which\r\nher life would end.\"\r\n\r\nAlas, this was but too prophetic! Before she was fifty years old she lost\r\nher sight, and gradually the light of reason also, and her darkness was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nAn Italian writer tells the following story: \"Nature had endowed Rosalba\r\nwith lofty aspirations and a passionate soul; her heart yearned for the\r\nadmiration which her lack of personal attraction forbade her receiving.\r\nShe fully realized her plainness before the Emperor Charles XI. rudely\r\nbrought it home to her. When presented to him by the artist Bertoli, the\r\nEmperor exclaimed: 'She may be clever, Bertoli mio, this painter of\r\nthine, but she is remarkably ugly.' From which it would appear that\r\nCharles had not believed his mirror, since his ugliness far exceeded that\r\nof Rosalba! Her dark eyes, fine brow, good expression, and graceful pose\r\nof the head, as shown in her portrait, impress one more favorably than\r\nwould be anticipated from this story.\"\r\n\r\nMany of Rosalba's works have been reproduced by engravings; a collection\r\nof one hundred and fifty-seven of these are in the Dresden Gallery,\r\ntogether with several of her pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CASSATT, MARY.</b> Born in Pittsburg. Studied in Pennsylvania schools,\r\nand under Soyer and Bellay in Paris. She has lived and travelled much in\r\nEurope, and her pictures, which are of genre subjects, include scenes in\r\nFrance, Italy, Spain, and Holland.\r\n\r\nAmong her principal works are \"La tasse de thé,\" \"Le lever du bébé,\"\r\n\"Reading,\" \"Mère et Enfant,\" and \"Caresse Maternelle.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Cassatt has exhibited at the Paris Salon, the National Academy, New\r\nYork, and various other exhibitions, but her works are rarely if ever\r\nexhibited in recent days. It is some years since William Walton wrote of\r\nher: \"But in general she seems to have attained that desirable condition,\r\ncoveted by artists, of being able to dispense with the annual\r\nexhibitions.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Cassatt executed a large, decorative picture for the north tympanum\r\nof the Woman's Building at the Columbian Exhibition.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Century Magazine_, March, 1899, says: \"Of the colony of\r\nAmerican artists, who for a decade or two past have made Paris their\r\nhome, few have been more interesting and none more serious than Miss\r\nCassatt.... Miss Cassatt has found her true bent in her recent pictures\r\nof children and in the delineation of happy maternity. These she has\r\nportrayed with delicacy, refinement, and sentiment. Her technique appeals\r\nequally to the layman and the artist, and her color has all the\r\ntenderness and charm that accompanies so engaging a motif.\"\r\n\r\nIn November, 1903, Miss Cassatt held an exhibition of her works in New\r\nYork. At the winter exhibition of the Philadelphia Academy, 1904, she\r\nexhibited a group, a mother and children, one child quite nude. Arthur\r\nHoeber described it as \"securing great charm of manner, of color, and of\r\ngrace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CATTANEO, MARIA.</b> Bronze medal at the National Exposition, Parma,\r\n1870; silver medal at Florence, 1871; silver medal at the centenary of\r\nAriosto at Ferrara. Made an honorary member of the Brera Academy, Milan,\r\n1874, an honor rarely conferred on a woman; elected to the Academy of\r\nUrbino, 1875. Born in Milan. Pupil of her father and of Angelo Rossi.\r\n\r\nShe excels in producing harmony between all parts of her works. She has\r\nan exquisite sense of color and a rare technique. Good examples of her\r\nwork are \"The Flowers of Cleopatra,\" \"The Return from the Country,\" \"An\r\nExcursion by Gondola.\" She married the artist, Pietro Michis. Her picture\r\nof the \"Fish Market in Venice\" attracted much attention when it appeared\r\nin 1887; it was a most accurate study from life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CHARPENTIER, CONSTANCE MARIE.</b> Pupil of David. Her best known works\r\nwere \"Ulysses Finding Young Astyanax at Hector's Grave\" and \"Alexander\r\nWeeping at the Death of the Wife of Darius.\" These were extraordinary as\r\nthe work of a woman. Their size, with the figures as large as life, made\r\nthem appear to be ambitious, as they were certainly unusual. Her style\r\nwas praised by the admirers of David, to whose teaching she did credit.\r\nThe disposition of her figures was good, the details of her costumes and\r\naccessories were admirably correct, but her color was hard and she was\r\ngenerally thought to be wanting in originality and too close a follower\r\nof her master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CHARRETIE, ANNA MARIA.</b> 1819-75. Her first exhibitions at the Royal\r\nAcademy, London, were miniatures and flower pieces. Later she painted\r\nportraits and figure subjects, as well as flowers. In 1872 \"Lady Betty\r\nGermain\" was greatly admired for the grace of the figure and the\r\nexquisite finish of the details. In 1873 she exhibited \"Lady Betty's\r\nMaid\" and \"Lady Betty Shopping.\" \"Lady Teazle Behind the Screen\" was\r\ndated 1871, and \"Mistress of Herself tho' China Fall\" was painted and\r\nexhibited in the last year of her life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CHASE, ADELAIDE COLE.</b> Member of Art Students' Association. Born in\r\nBoston. Daughter of J. Foxcroft Cole. Studied at the School of the Museum\r\nof Fine Arts, under Tarbell, and also under Jean Paul Laurens and Carolus\r\nDuran in Paris; and with Vinton in Boston.\r\n\r\nMrs. Chase has painted portraits entirely, most of which are in or near\r\nBoston; her artistic reputation among painters of her own specialty is\r\nexcellent, and her portraits are interesting aside from the persons\r\nrepresented, when considered purely as works of art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From a Copley Print.\r\n\r\nA PORTRAIT\r\n\r\nADELAIDE COLE CHASE]\r\n\r\nA portrait called a \"Woman with a Muff,\" exhibited recently at the\r\nexhibition of the Society of American Artists, in New York, was much\r\nadmired. At the 1904 exhibition of the Philadelphia Academy Mrs. Chase\r\nexhibited a portrait of children, Constance and Gordon Worcester, of\r\nwhich Arthur Hoeber writes: \"She has painted them easily, with deftness\r\nand feeling, and apparently caught their character and the delicacy of\r\ninfancy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CHAUCHET, CHARLOTTE.</b> Honorable mention at the Salon, 1901;\r\nthird-class medal, 1902. Member of the Société des Artistes Français and\r\nof l'Union des femmes peintres et sculpteurs. Born at Charleville,\r\nArdennes, in 1878. Pupil of Gabriel Thurner, Benjamin-Constant, Jean Paul\r\nLaurens, and Victor Marec. Her principal works are \"Marée\"--Fish--1899,\r\npurchased for the lottery of the International Exposition at Lille;\r\n\"Breton Interior,\" purchased by the Society of the Friends of the Arts,\r\nat Nantes; \"Mother Closmadenc Dressing Fish,\" in the Museum of Brest;\r\n\"Interior of a Kitchen at Mont,\" purchased by the Government; \"Portrait\r\nof my Grandmother,\" which obtained honorable mention; \"At the Corner of\r\nthe Fire,\" \"A Little Girl in the Open Air,\" medal of third class.\r\n\r\nThe works of Mlle. Chauchet have been much praised. The _Petit Moniteur_,\r\nJune, 1899, says: \"Mlle. Chauchet, a very young girl, in her picture of a\r\n'Breton Interior' shows a vigor and decision very rare in a woman.\" Of\r\nthe \"Marée,\" the _Dépêche de Brest_ says: \"On a sombre background, in\r\nartistic disorder, thrown pell-mell on the ground, are baskets and a\r\nshining copper kettle, with a mass of fish of all sorts, of varied forms,\r\nand changing colors. All well painted. Such is the picture by Mlle.\r\nChauchet.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Courrier de l'Est_ we read: \"Mlle. Chauchet, taking her\r\ngrandmother for her model, has painted one of the best portraits of the\r\nSalon. The hands, deformed by disease and age, are especially effective;\r\nthe delicate tone of the hair in contrast with the lace of the cap makes\r\nan attractive variation in white.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Union Républicaine de la Marne_, H. Bernard writes: \"'Le\r\nretour des champs' is a picture of the plain of Berry at evening. We see\r\nthe back of a peasant, nude above the blue linen pantaloons, with the\r\nfeet in wooden sabots. He is holding his tired, heavy cow by the tether.\r\nThe setting sun lights up his powerful bronzed back, his prominent\r\nshoulders, and the hindquarters of the cow. It is all unusually strong;\r\nthe drawing is firm and very bold in the foreshortening of the animal.\r\nThe effect of the whole is a little sad; the sobriety of the execution\r\nemphasizes this effect, and, above all, there is in it no suggestion of\r\nthe feminine. I have already noticed this quality of almost brutal\r\nsincerity, of picturesque realism, in the works of Mlle. Chauchet who\r\nsuccessfully follows her methods.\"\r\n\r\nChaussée, Mlle. Cécile de.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CHÉRON, ELIZABETH SOPHIE.</b> Born in Paris in 1648. Her father was an\r\nartist, and under his instruction Elizabeth attained such perfection in\r\nminiature and enamel painting that her works were praised by the most\r\ndistinguished artists. In 1674 Charles le Brun proposed her name and she\r\nwas elected to the Academy.\r\n\r\nHer exquisite taste in the arrangement of her subjects, the grace of her\r\ndraperies, and, above all, the refinement and spirituality of her\r\npictures, were the characteristics on which her fame was based.\r\n\r\nHer life outside her art was interesting. Her father was a rigid\r\nCalvinist, and endeavored to influence his daughter to adopt his\r\nreligious belief; but her mother, who was a fervent Roman Catholic,\r\npersuaded Elizabeth to pass a year in a convent, during which time she\r\nardently embraced the faith of her mother. She was an affectionate\r\ndaughter to both her parents and devoted her earnings to her brother\r\nLouis, who made his studies in Italy.\r\n\r\nIn her youth Elizabeth Chéron seemed insensible to the attractions of the\r\nbrilliant men in her social circle, and was indifferent to the offers of\r\nmarriage which she received; but when sixty years old, to the surprise of\r\nher friends, she married Monsieur Le Hay, a gentleman of her own age. One\r\nof her biographers, leaving nothing to the imagination, assures us that\r\n\"substantial esteem and respect were the foundations of their matrimonial\r\nhappiness, rather than any pretence of romantic sentiment.\"\r\n\r\nMlle. Chéron's narrative verse was much admired and her spiritual poetry\r\nwas thought to resemble that of J. B. Rousseau. In 1699 she was elected\r\nto the Accademia dei Ricovrati of Padua, where she was known as Erato.\r\nThe honors bestowed on her did not lessen the modesty of her bearing. She\r\nwas simple in dress, courteous in her intercourse with her inferiors, and\r\nto the needy a helpful friend.\r\n\r\nShe died when sixty-three and was buried in the church of St. Sulpice. I\r\ntranslate the lines written by the Abbé Bosquillon and placed beneath her\r\nportrait: \"The unusual possession of two exquisite talents will render\r\nChéron an ornament to France for all time. Nothing save the grace of her\r\nbrush could equal the excellencies of her pen.\"\r\n\r\nPictures by this artist are seen in various collections in France, but\r\nthe larger number of her works were portraits which are in the families\r\nof her subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CHERRY, EMMA RICHARDSON.</b> Gold medal from Western Art Association in\r\n1891. Member of above association and of the Denver Art Club. Born at\r\nAurora, Illinois, 1859. Pupil of Julian and Delécluse Academies in Paris,\r\nalso of Merson, and of the Art Students' League in New York.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cherry is a portrait painter, and in 1903 was much occupied in this\r\nart in Chicago and vicinity. Among her sitters were Mr. Orrington Lunt,\r\nthe donor of the Library of the Northwestern University, and Bishop\r\nFoster, a former president of the same university; these are to be placed\r\nin the library. A portrait by Mrs. Cherry of a former president of the\r\nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers, Mr. O. Chanute, is to be placed in\r\nthe club rooms of the society in New York. It has been done at the\r\nrequest of the society.\r\n\r\nAn exhibition of ten portraits by this artist was held in Chicago in\r\n1903, and was favorably noticed. Mrs. Cherry resides in Houston, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CLEMENT, ETHEL.</b> This artist has received several awards from\r\nCalifornia State fair exhibits, and her pastel portrait of her mother was\r\nhung on the line at the Salon of 1898. Member of San Francisco Art\r\nAssociation and of the Sketch Club of that city. Born in San Francisco in\r\n1874. Her studies began in her native city with drawing from the antique\r\nand from life under Fred Yates. At the Cowles Art School, Boston, and the\r\nArt Students' League, New York, she spent three winters, and at the\r\nJulian Academy, Paris, three other winters, drawing from life and\r\npainting in oils under the teaching of Jules Lefebvre and Robert-Fleury,\r\nsupplementing these studies by that of landscape in oils under George\r\nLaugée in Picardie.\r\n\r\nHer portraits, figure subjects, and landscapes are numerous, and are\r\nprincipally in private collections, a large proportion being in San\r\nFrancisco. Her recent work has been landscape painting in New England. In\r\n1903 she exhibited a number of pictures in Boston which attracted\r\nfavorable attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>COHEN, KATHERINE M.</b> Honorary member of the American Art Association,\r\nParis, and of the New Century Club, Philadelphia.

She has made many portraits in busts and bas-reliefs,\r\nas well as imaginary subjects and decorative works. \"The Israelite\" is a\r\nlife-size statue and an excellent work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>COLLAERT, MARIE.</b> Born in Brussels, 1842. Is called the Flemish Rosa\r\nBonheur and the Muse of Belgian landscape. Her pictures of country life\r\nare most attractive. Her powerful handling of her brush is modified by a\r\ntender, feminine sentiment.\r\n\r\nI quote from the \"History of Modern Painters\": \"In Marie Collaert's\r\npictures may be found quiet nooks beneath clear sky-green stretches of\r\ngrass where the cows are at pasture in idyllic peace.

Studied in Brussels under Leroy\r\nand Gallais, and spent a year at South Kensington in the study of\r\nanatomy. Mrs. Cookesley has lived in Newfoundland and in San Francisco. A\r\nvisit to Constantinople brought her a commission to paint a portrait of\r\nthe son of the Sultan. No sittings were accorded her, the Sultan\r\nthinking a photograph sufficient for the artist to work from. Fortunately\r\nMrs. Cookesley was able to make a sketch of her subject while following\r\nthe royal carriage in which he was riding. The portrait proved so\r\nsatisfactory to the Sultan that he not only decorated the artist, but\r\ninvited her to make portraits of some of his wives, for which Mrs.\r\nCookesley had not time. Her pictures of Oriental subjects have been\r\nsuccessful. Among these are: \"An Arab Café in the Slums of Cairo,\" much\r\nnoticed in the Academy Exhibition of 1895; \"Noon at Ramazan,\" \"The\r\nSnake-Charmer,\" \"Umbrellas to Mend--Damascus,\" and a group of the\r\n\"Soudanese Friends of Gordon.\" Her \"Priestess of Isis\" is owned in Cairo.\r\n\r\nAmong her pictures of Western subjects are \"The Puritan's Daughter,\"\r\n\"Deliver Us from Evil,\" \"The Gambler's Wife.\" \"Widowed\" and \"Miss Calhoun\r\nas Salome\" were purchased by Maclean, of the Haymarket Theatre; \"Death of\r\nthe First-Born\" is owned in Russia; and \"Portrait of Ellen Terry as\r\nImogen\" is in a private collection.\r\n\r\n\"Lion Tamers in the Time of Nero\" is one of her important pictures of\r\nanimals, of which she has made many sketches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>COOPER, EMMA LAMPERT.</b> Awarded medal at World's Columbian Exposition,\r\n1893; bronze medal, Atlanta Exposition, 1895.

Lockwood, New York; and a\r\n\"Holland Interior\" by Dr. Gessler, Philadelphia. Of her recent exhibition\r\na critic writes: \"The pictures are notable for their careful attention to\r\ndetail of drawing. Architectural features of the rich old Gothic churches\r\nare faithfully indicated instead of blurred, and the treatment is almost\r\ndevotional in tone, so sympathetic is the quality of the work. There is a\r\ntotal absence of the garish coloring which has become so common, the\r\nreligious subjects being without exception in a minor key, usually soft\r\ngrays and blues. It is indeed in composition and careful drawing that\r\nthis artist excels rather than in coloring, although this afterthought is\r\nsuggested by the canvasses treating of secular subjects.\"--_Brooklyn\r\nStandard Union_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CORAZZI, GIULITTA.</b> Born at Fivizzano, 1866. Went to Florence when\r\nstill a child and early began to study art. She took a diploma at the\r\nAcademy in 1886, having been a pupil of Cassioli. She is a portrait\r\npainter, and among her best works are the portraits of the Counts\r\nFrancesco and Ottorino Tenderini, Giuseppe Erede, and Raffaello\r\nMorvanti. Her pictures of flowers are full of freshness and spirit and\r\ndelightful in color.

Born in Lesso, 1840. This artist is both a painter\r\nand a sculptor. Pupil of Biagio Molinari, she supplemented his\r\ninstructions by constant visits to galleries and museums, where she could\r\nstudy masterpieces of art. A statue called \"The Undeceived\" and a group,\r\n\"The Task,\" did much to establish her reputation. They were exhibited in\r\nNaples, Milan, and Verona, and aroused widespread interest.\r\n\r\nHer pictures are numerous. Among them are \"St. Louis,\" \"Sappho,\"\r\n\"Petrarch and Laura,\" \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Hagar and Ishmael in the\r\nDesert,\" \"A Devotee of the Virgin,\" exhibited at Turin in 1884; a series\r\nillustrating the \"Seasons,\" and four others representing the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>COSWAY, MARIA</b>. The artist known by this name was born Maria\r\nHadfield, the daughter of an Englishman who acquired a fortune as a\r\nhotel-keeper in Leghorn, which was Maria's birthplace. She was educated\r\nin a convent, and early manifesting unusual artistic ability, was sent to\r\nRome to study painting. Her friends there, among whom were Battoni,\r\nRaphael Mengs, and Fuseli, found much to admire and praise in her art.\r\n\r\nAfter her father's death Maria ardently desired to become a nun, but her\r\nmother persuaded her to go to England. Here she came under the influence\r\nof Angelica Kauffman, and devoted herself assiduously to painting.\r\n\r\nShe married Richard Cosway, an eminent painter of miniatures in\r\nwater-colors. Cosway was a man of fortune with a good position in the\r\nfashionable circles of London. For a time after their marriage Maria\r\nlived in seclusion, her husband wishing her to acquire the dignity and\r\ngrace requisite for success in the society which he frequented. Meantime\r\nshe continued to paint in miniature, and her pictures attracted much\r\nattention in the Academy exhibitions.\r\n\r\nWhen at length Cosway introduced her to the London world, she was greatly\r\nadmired; her receptions were crowded, and the most eminent people sat to\r\nher for their portraits. Her picture of the Duchess of Devonshire in the\r\ncharacter of Spenser's Cynthia was very much praised. Cosway did not\r\npermit her to be paid for her work, and as a consequence many costly\r\ngifts were made her in return for her miniatures, which were regarded as\r\nveritable treasures by their possessors.\r\n\r\nMaria Cosway had a delicious voice in singing, which, in addition to her\r\nother talent, her beauty, and grace, made her unusually popular in\r\nsociety, and her house was a centre for all who had any pretensions to a\r\nplace in the best circles. Poets, authors, orators, lords, ladies,\r\ndiplomats, as well as the Prince of Wales, were to be seen in her\r\ndrawing-rooms. A larger house was soon required for the Cosways, and the\r\ndescription of it in \"Nollekens and His Times\" is interesting:\r\n\r\n\"Many of the rooms were more like scenes of enchantment pencilled by a\r\npoet's fancy, than anything perhaps before displayed in a domestic\r\nhabitation. Escritoires of ebony, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and rich\r\ncaskets for antique gems, exquisitely enamelled and adorned with onyx,\r\nopals, rubies, and emeralds; cabinets of ivory, curiously wrought; mosaic\r\ntables, set with jasper, blood-stone, and lapis-lazuli, their feet carved\r\ninto the claws of lions and eagles; screens of old raised Oriental Japan;\r\nmassive musical clocks, richly chased with ormulu and tortoise-shell;\r\nottomans superbly damasked; Persian and other carpets, with corresponding\r\nhearth-rugs bordered with ancient family crests and armorial ensigns in\r\nthe centre, and rich hangings of English tapestry. The carved\r\nchimney-pieces were adorned with the choicest bronzes and models in wax\r\nand terra-cotta. The tables were covered with Sèvres, blue Mandarin,\r\nNankin, and Dresden china, and the cabinets were surmounted with crystal\r\ncups, adorned with the York and Lancaster roses, which might have graced\r\nthe splendid banquets of the proud Wolsey.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this fatiguing luxury, Maria Cosway lost her health\r\nand passed several years travelling in Europe. Returning to London, she\r\nwas again prostrated by the death of her only daughter. She then went to\r\nLodi, near Milan, where she founded a college for the education of girls.\r\nShe spent much time in Lodi, and after the death of her husband\r\nestablished herself there permanently. A goodly circle of friends\r\ngathered about her, and she found occupation and solace for her griefs in\r\nthe oversight of her college.\r\n\r\nShe continued her painting and the exhibition of her pictures at the\r\nRoyal Academy. She made illustrations for the works of Virgil, Homer,\r\nSpenser, and other poets, and painted portraits of interesting and\r\ndistinguished persons, among whom were Mme. Le Brun and Mme. Récamier.\r\nThe life and work of Maria Cosway afford a striking contradiction of the\r\ntheory that wealth and luxury induce idleness and dull the powers of\r\ntheir possessors. Hers is but one of the many cases in which a woman's a\r\nwoman \"for a' that.\"\r\n\r\nAt an art sale in London in 1901, an engraving by V. Green after Mrs.\r\nCosway's portrait of herself, first state, brought $1,300, and a second\r\none $200 less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>COUDERT, AMALIA KÜSSNER.</b> Born in Terre Haute, Indiana. This\r\ndistinguished miniaturist writes me that she \"never studied.\" Like Topsy,\r\nshe must have \"growed.\" By whatever method they are produced or by\r\nwhatever means the artist in her has been evolved, her pictures would\r\nseem to prove that study of a most intelligent order has done its part in\r\nher development.\r\n\r\nShe has executed miniature portraits of the Czar and Czarina of Russia,\r\nthe Grand Duchess Vladimir, King Edward VII., the late Cecil Rhodes, many\r\nEnglish ladies of rank, and a great number of the beautiful and\r\nfashionable women of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>COUTAN-MONTORGUEIL, MME.

Also busts\r\nof Prince Napoleon, General Boulanger, the Countess de Choiseul, the\r\nCountess de Vogué, and numerous statuettes and other compositions.\r\n\r\nAt the Salon, Artistes Français, 1903, she exhibited \"Fortune\" and \"A\r\nStatuette.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>COWLES, GENEVIEVE ALMEDA.</b> Member of the Woman's Art Club, New York;\r\nClub of Women Art Workers, New York; and the Paint and Clay Club of New\r\nHaven. Born in Farmington, Connecticut, 1871. Pupil of Robert Brandagee;\r\nof the Cowles Art School, Boston; and of Professor Niemeyer at the Yale\r\nArt School.\r\n\r\nTogether with her twin sister, Maud, this artist has illustrated various\r\nmagazine articles. Also several books, among which are \"The House of the\r\nSeven Gables,\" \"Old Virginia,\" etc.\r\n\r\nMiss G. A. Cowles designed a memorial window and a decorative border for\r\nthe chancel of St. Michael's Church, Brooklyn. Together with her sister,\r\nshe designed a window in the memory of the Deaconess, Miss Stillman, in\r\nGrace Church, New York City. These sisters now execute many windows and\r\nother decorative work for churches, and also superintend the making and\r\nplacing of the windows.\r\n\r\nRegarding their work in the Chapel of Christ Church, New Haven, Miss\r\nGenevieve Cowles writes me: \"These express the Prayer of the Prisoner,\r\nthe Prayer of the Soul in Darkness, and the Prayer of Old Age. These are\r\npaintings of states of the soul and of deep emotions. The paintings are\r\nrecords of human lives and not mere imagination. We study our characters\r\ndirectly from life.\"\r\n\r\nThese artists are now, November, 1903, engaged upon a landscape frieze\r\nfor a dining-room in a house at Watch Hill.\r\n\r\nMiss Genevieve Cowles writes: \"We feel that we are only at the beginning\r\nof our life-work, which is to be chiefly in mural decoration and stained\r\nglass. I desire especially to work for prisons, hospitals, and\r\nasylums--for those whose great need of beauty seems often to be\r\nforgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>COWLES, MAUD ALICE.</b> Twin sister of Genevieve Cowles. Bronze medal at\r\nParis Exposition, 1900, and a medal at Buffalo, 1901. Her studies were\r\nthe same as her sister's, and she is a member of the same societies.\r\nIndeed, what has been said above is equally true of the two sisters, as\r\nthey usually work on the same windows and decorations, dividing the\r\ndesigning and execution between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>COX, LOUISE--MRS. KENYON COX.</b> Third Hallgarten prize, National\r\nAcademy of Design; bronze medal, Paris Exposition, 1900; silver medal at\r\nBuffalo, 1901; medal at Charleston, 1902; Shaw Memorial prize, Society of\r\nAmerican Artists, 1903. Member of Society of American Artists, and an\r\nassociate of the Academy of Design. Born at San Francisco, 1865. Studies\r\nmade at Academy of Design, Art Students' League, under C. Turner, George\r\nde Forest Brush, and Kenyon Cox.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cox paints small decorative pictures and portraits, mostly of\r\nchildren. The Shaw prize was awarded to a child's portrait, called\r\n\"Olive.\" Among other subjects she has painted an \"Annunciation,\" the\r\n\"Fates,\" and \"Angiola,\" reproduced in this book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From a Copley Print.\r\n\r\nANGIOLA\r\n\r\nLOUISE COX]\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Cosmopolitan_ says: \"Mrs. Cox is an earnest worker and\r\nher method is interesting. Each picture is the result of many sketches\r\nand the study of many models, representing in a composite way the\r\nperfections of all. For the Virgin in her 'Annunciation' a model was\r\nfirst posed in the nude, and then another draped, the artist sketching\r\nthe figure in the nude, draping it from the second model. The hands are\r\nalways separately sketched from a model who has a peculiar grace in\r\nfolding them naturally.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cox gives her ideas about her picture of the \"Fates\" as follows: \"My\r\ninterpretation of the Fates is not the one usually accepted. The idea\r\ntook root in my mind years ago when I was a student at the League. It\r\nremained urgently with me until I was forced to work it out. As you see,\r\nthe faces of the Fates are young and beautiful, but almost\r\nexpressionless. The heads are drooping, the eyes heavy as though half\r\nasleep. My idea is, that they are merely instruments under the control of\r\na higher power. They perform their work, they must do it without will or\r\nwish of their own. It would be beyond human or superhuman endurance for\r\nany conscious instrument to bear for ages and ages the horrible\r\nresponsibility placed upon the Fates.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CRESPO DE REIGON, ASUNCION.</b> Honorable mention at the National\r\nExhibition, Madrid, 1860. Member of the Academy of San Fernando, 1839.\r\nPupil of her father. To the exhibition in 1860 she sent a \"Magdalen in\r\nthe Desert,\" \"The Education of the Virgin,\" \"The Divine Shepherdess,\" \"A\r\nMadonna,\" and a \"Venus.\" Her works have been seen in many public\r\nexhibitions. In 1846 she exhibited a miniature of Queen Isabel II. Many\r\nof her pictures are in private collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CROMENBURCH, ANNA VON.</b> In the Museum of Madrid are four portraits by\r\nthis artist: \"A Lady of the Netherlands,\" which belonged to Philip IV.;\r\n\"A Lady and Child,\" \"A Lady with her Infant before Her,\" and another\r\n\"Portrait of a Lady.\" The catalogue of the Museum gallery says: \"It is\r\nnot known in what place or in what year this talented lady was born. She\r\nis said to have belonged to an old and noble family of Friesland. At any\r\nrate, she was an excellent portrait painter, and flourished about the end\r\nof the sixteenth century. The Museo del Prado is the only gallery in\r\nEurope which possesses works signed by this distinguished artist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>DAHN-FRIES, SOPHIE.</b> Born in Munich. 1835-98. This artist was endowed\r\nwith unusual musical and artistic talent. After the education of her only\r\nson, she devoted herself to painting, principally of landscape and\r\nflowers. After 1868, so long as she lived she was much interested in Frau\r\nvon Weber's Art School for Girls. In 1886, when a financial crisis came,\r\nMme. Dahn-Fries saved the enterprise from ruin. She exhibited, in 1887,\r\ntwo pictures which are well known--\"Harvest Time\" and \"Forest Depths.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>DAMER, MRS. ANNE SEYMOUR.</b> Family name Conway. 1748-1828. She was a\r\ngranddaughter of the Duke of Argyle, a relative of the Marquis of\r\nHertford, and a cousin of Horace Walpole. Her education was conducted\r\nwith great care; the history of ancient nations, especially in relation\r\nto art, was her favorite study. She had seen but few sculptures, but was\r\nfascinated by them, and almost unconsciously cherished the idea that she\r\ncould at least model portraits and possibly give form to original\r\nconceptions.\r\n\r\nAllan Cunningham wrote of her thus: \"Her birth entitled her to a life of\r\nease and luxury; her beauty exposed her to the assiduity of suitors and\r\nthe temptations of courts; but it was her pleasure to forget all such\r\nadvantages and dedicate the golden hours of her youth to the task of\r\nraising a name by working in wet clay, plaster of Paris, stubborn marble,\r\nand still more intractable bronze.\"\r\n\r\nBefore she had seriously determined to attempt the realization of her\r\ndreams, she was brought to a decision by a caustic remark of the\r\nhistorian, Hume. Miss Conway was one day walking with him when they met\r\nan Italian boy with plaster vases and figures to sell. Hume examined the\r\nwares and talked with the boy. Not long after, in the presence of several\r\nother people, Miss Conway ridiculed Hume's taste in art; he answered her\r\nsarcastically and intimated that no woman could display as much science\r\nand genius as had entered into the making of the plaster casts she so\r\nscorned.\r\n\r\nThis decided her to test herself, and, obtaining wax and the proper\r\ntools, she worked industriously until she had made a head that she was\r\nwilling to show to others. She then presented it to Hume; it has been\r\nsaid that it was his own portrait, but we do not know if this is true. At\r\nall events, Hume was forced to commend her work, and added that modelling\r\nin wax was very easy, but to chisel in marble was quite another task.\r\nPiqued by this scant praise she worked on courageously, and before long\r\nshowed her critic a copy of the wax head done in marble.\r\n\r\nThough Hume genuinely admired certain portions of this work, it is not\r\nsurprising that he also found defects in it. Doubtless his critical\r\nattitude stimulated the young sculptress to industry; but the true\r\nart-impulse was awakened, and her friends soon observed that Miss Conway\r\nwas no longer interested in their usual pursuits. When the whole truth\r\nwas known, it caused much comment. Of course ladies had painted, but to\r\nwork with the hands in wet clay and be covered with marble dust--to say\r\nthe least, Miss Conway was eccentric.\r\n\r\nShe at once began the study of anatomy under Cruikshanks, modelling with\r\nCerrachi, and the handling of marble in the studio of Bacon.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for her art, she was married at nineteen to John Darner,\r\neldest son of Lord Milton, a fop and spendthrift, who had run through a\r\nlarge fortune. He committed suicide nine years after his marriage. It is\r\nsaid that Harrington, in Miss Burney's novel of \"Cecilia,\" was drawn from\r\nJohn Damer, and that his wardrobe was sold for $75,000--about half its\r\noriginal cost!\r\n\r\nMrs. Damer was childless, and very soon after her husband's death she\r\ntravelled in Europe and renewed her study and practice of sculpture with\r\nenthusiasm. By some of her friends her work was greatly admired, but\r\nWalpole so exaggerated his praise of her that one can but think that he\r\nwrote out of his cousinly affection for the artist, rather than from a\r\njudicial estimate of her talent. He bequeathed to her, for her life, his\r\nvilla of Strawberry Hill, with all its valuables, and £2,000 a year for\r\nits maintenance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Damer executed many portrait busts, some animal subjects, two\r\ncolossal heads, symbolic of the Thames and the Isis, intended for the\r\nadornment of the bridge at Henley. Her statue of the king, in marble, was\r\nplaced in the Register Office in Edinburgh. She made a portrait bust of\r\nherself for the Uffizi Gallery, in Florence. Her portrait busts of her\r\nrelatives were numerous and are still seen in private galleries. She\r\nexecuted two groups of \"Sleeping Dogs,\" one for Queen Caroline and a\r\nsecond for her brother-in-law, the Duke of Richmond. Napoleon asked her\r\nfor a bust of Fox, which she made and presented to the Emperor. A bust of\r\nherself which she made for Richard Payne Knight was by him bequeathed to\r\nthe British Museum. Her \"Death of Cleopatra\" was modelled in relief, and\r\nan engraving from it was used as a vignette on the title-page of the\r\nsecond volume of Boydell's Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThose who have written of Mrs. Darner's art have taken extreme views.\r\nThey have praised _ad nauseam_, as Walpole did when he wrote: \"Mrs.\r\nDarner's busts from life are not inferior to the antique. Her shock dog,\r\nlarge as life and only not alive, rivals the marble one of Bernini in\r\nthe Royal Collection. As the ancients have left us but five animals of\r\nequal merit with their human figures--viz., the Barberini Goat, the\r\nTuscan Boar, the Mattei Eagle, the Eagle at Strawberry Hill, and Mr.\r\nJennings' Dog--the talent of Mrs. Damer must appear in the most\r\ndistinguished light.\"\r\n\r\nCerrachi made a full length figure of Mrs. Damer, which he called the\r\nMuse of Sculpture, and Darwin, the poet, wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Long with soft touch shall Damers' chisel charm,\r\n    With grace delight us, and with beauty warm.\"\r\n\r\nQuite in opposition to this praise, other authors and critics have\r\nseverely denied the value of her talent, her originality, and her ability\r\nto finish her work properly. She has also been accused of employing an\r\nundue amount of aid in her art. As a woman she was unusual in her day,\r\nand as resolute in her opinions as those now known as strong-minded.\r\nEnglishwoman as she was, she sent a friendly message to Napoleon at the\r\ncrisis, just before the battle of Waterloo. She was a power in some\r\npolitical elections, and she stoutly stood by Queen Caroline during her\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nMrs. Damer was much esteemed by men of note. She ardently admired Charles\r\nFox, and, with the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire and Mrs. Crewe, she\r\ntook an active part in his election; \"rustling their silks in the lowest\r\nsinks of sin and misery, and in return for the electors' 'most sweet\r\nvoices' submitting, it is said, their own sweet cheeks to the salutes of\r\nbutchers and bargemen.\" She did not hesitate to openly express her\r\nsympathy with the American colonies, and bravely defended their cause.\r\n\r\nAt Strawberry Hill Mrs. Damer dispensed a generous hospitality, and many\r\ndistinguished persons were her guests; Joanna Baillie, Mrs. Siddons, Mrs.\r\nGarrick, and Mrs. Berry and her daughters were of her intimate circle.\r\n\r\nShe was fond of the theatre and frequently acted as an amateur in private\r\nhouses. She was excellent in high comedy and recited poetry effectively.\r\nMrs. Damer was one of the most interesting of Englishwomen at a period of\r\nunusual excitement and importance.\r\n\r\nWhen seventy years old she was persuaded to leave Strawberry Hill, and\r\nLord Waldegrave, on whom it was entailed, took possession. Mrs. Damer\r\nthen purchased York House, the birthplace of Queen Anne, where she spent\r\nten summers, her winter home being in Park Lane, London.\r\n\r\nShe bequeathed her artistic works to a relative, directed that her apron\r\nand tools should be placed in her coffin, and all her letters destroyed,\r\nby which she deprived the world of much that would now be historically\r\nvaluable, since she had corresponded with Nelson and Fox, as well as with\r\nother men and women who were active in the important movements of her\r\ntime. She was buried at Tunbridge, Kent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>DASSEL, MRS. HERMINIE,</b> whose family name was Borchard. Daughter of a\r\nPrussian gentleman, who, having lost his fortune, came to the United\r\nStates in 1839. His children had enjoyed the advantages of education and\r\nof an excellent position in the world, but here, in a strange land, were\r\nforced to consider the means of their support. Herminie determined to be\r\na painter, and in some way earned the money to go to Düsseldorf, where\r\nshe studied four years under Sohn, all the time supporting herself. Her\r\npictures were genre subjects introducing children, which found a ready\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nShe returned to America, determined to earn money to go to Italy. In a\r\nyear she earned a thousand dollars, and out of it paid some expenses for\r\na brother whom she wished to take with her. Herminie was still young, and\r\nso petite in person that her friends were alarmed by her ambitions and\r\nstrenuously opposed her plans. However, she persevered and reached Italy,\r\nbut unfortunately the Revolution of 1848 made it impossible for her to\r\nremain, and she had many unhappy experiences in returning to New York.\r\n\r\nHer pictures were appreciated, and several of them were purchased by the\r\nArt Union, then existing in New York. Soon after her return to America\r\nshe married Mr. Dassel, and although she had a large family she continued\r\nto paint. Her picture of \"Othello\" is in the Düsseldorf Gallery. Her\r\npainting of \"Effie Deans\" attracted much attention.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dassel interested herself in charities and was admired as an artist\r\nand greatly respected as a woman. She died in 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>DEALY, JANE MARY--MRS. W. LLEWELLYN LEWIS.</b> Silver medal at Royal\r\nAcademy School and prize for best drawing of the year. Member of Royal\r\nInstitute of Painters in Water-Colors. Born in Liverpool. Studied at\r\nSlade School and Royal Academy School. Has exhibited several years at\r\nthe Royal Academy Exhibition and Institute of Painters in Water-Colors.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 her picture, \"A Dutch Bargain,\" was etched and engraved.\r\n\"Hush-a-Bye Baby\" and \"Good-by, Summer,\" have been published by Messrs.\r\nDe la Rue et Cie. She has successfully illustrated the following\r\nchildren's books: \"Sixes and Sevens,\" \"The Land of Little People,\"\r\n\"Children's Prayers,\" and \"Children's Hymns.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Academy Exhibition of 1903 Mrs. Lewis sent \"On the Mountain-side,\r\nEngelberg.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>DE ANGELIS, CLOTILDE.</b> This Neapolitan artist has made a good\r\nimpression in at least two Italian exhibitions. To the National\r\nExposition, Naples, 1877, she sent \"Studio dal Vero\" and \"Vallata di\r\nPorrano,\" showing costumes of Amalfi. Both her drawing and color are\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>DEBILLEMONT-CHARDON, MME. GABRIELLE.</b> Third-class medal, Salon, 1894;\r\nhonorable mention at Paris Exposition, 1900; second-class medal, Salon,\r\n1901. This miniaturist is well known by her works, in which so much\r\ngrace, freshness, skill, and delicacy are shown; in which are represented\r\nsuch charming subjects with purity of tone and skilful execution in all\r\nregards, as well as with an incomparable spirit of attractiveness.\r\n\r\nThis artist is one of the three miniaturists whose works have a place in\r\nthe Museum of the Luxembourg. She has had many pupils, and by her\r\ninfluence and example--for they endeavor to imitate their teacher--she\r\nhas done much to improve and enlarge the style in miniature painting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>DE HAAS, MRS. ALICE PREBLE TUCKER.</b> Born in Boston. Studied at the\r\nCooper Union and with M. F. H. de Haas, Swain Gifford, William Chase, and\r\nRhoda Holmes Nicholls. Painter of water-color pictures and miniatures.\r\n\r\nHer pictures are in private hands in Washington, New York, and Boston.\r\n\r\nThe following article written at the time of an exhibition by Mrs. de\r\nHaas gives a just estimate of her work:\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. de Haas is especially devoted to the painting in water-color of\r\nlandscape and sea views, for which the Atlantic coast affords such a wide\r\nand varied range. A constant and keen observer of Nature, she has seized\r\nher marvellous witchery of light and color, and reproduced them in the\r\nglow of the moonlight on the water when in a stormy mood, and the silvery\r\ngleam has become an almost vivid orange tint. She is most happy in the\r\ntender opalescent hues of the calm sea and the soft sky above, while the\r\nlittle boats seem to rock quietly on the water, barely stirred by the\r\nunruffled tide beneath.\r\n\r\n\"The sunset light is a never-failing source of variety and beauty, and\r\nMrs. de Haas has found a most attractive subject in the steeple of the\r\nold church in York Village--whose graceful curves are said to have been\r\ndesigned by Sir Christopher Wren--as it rises above the soft mellow glow\r\nof the sky or is pictured against the dark clouds.\r\n\r\n\"In another mood the artist paints the low rocks among the reeds, with\r\nthe breakers playing about them, while the distant sea stretches out to a\r\nhorizon, with dark, stormy clouds brooding over the solitary waste. A\r\nremarkable union of the beauty of land and water is produced by a\r\nforeground of brilliant fancy flowers relieved by a scrubby tree in the\r\nbackground, with the faint responsive touch of yellow in the clouds over\r\na calm sea, where gentle motion is only indicated by the little boat\r\nfloating on its surface.\r\n\r\n\"The schooners on the Magnolia Shore with Norman's Woe in the distance\r\nsuggest alike the tragic story of the past and the present beauty, for\r\nnow the sea is calm and the sails are drying in the sun after the storm\r\nis over.\r\n\r\n\"Many other pictures might be mentioned--a quaint old house at\r\nGloucester, a view of Ten Pound Island, with its picturesque\r\nsurroundings, and the familiar beach, with Fort Head at York Harbor. As a\r\nspecimen of landscape I would mention a picturesque group of trees at\r\nGerrish Island, full of sunshine.\r\n\r\n\"But Mrs. de Haas has added another most attractive style of art to her\r\nresources, and her miniatures, besides their charm of simplicity of\r\ntreatment and delicacy of coloring, are said to have the merit of\r\nfaithful likeness to their originals. Of course portraits, being painted\r\non commission, are not generally available for exhibition, but Mrs. de\r\nHaas has a few specimens of her work which warrant all that has been said\r\nin their praise.\r\n\r\n\"One is a charming picture of a child, which for beauty of delineation\r\nand delicacy of tinting recalls the memory of our greatest of miniature\r\npainters, Malbone.\r\n\r\n\"Another is the portrait of the artist's father, and is represented with\r\nsuch truth of nature and so much vitality of expression and character as\r\nat once to give rise to the remark, 'I must have known that man, he seems\r\nso living to me.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>DE KAY, HELENA--MRS. R. WATSON GILDER.</b> This artist has exhibited at\r\nthe National Academy of Design, New York, since 1874, flower pieces and\r\ndecorative panels. In 1878 she sent \"The Young Mother.\" She was the first\r\nwoman elected to the Society of American Artists, and to its first\r\nexhibition in 1878 she contributed \"The Last Arrow,\" a figure subject,\r\nalso a portrait and a picture of still-life.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>DELACROIX-GARNIER, MME.

Member of the Société des Artistes Français, the\r\nSociété Nationale des Beaux-Arts, Société des prix du Salon et boursiers\r\nde voyage de la Société Nationale. Born in Paris. Pupil of Jean Paul\r\nLaurens and Benjamin-Constant.\r\n\r\nHer picture of \"Diana in Repose\" is in the collection of Alphonse de\r\nRothschild; \"Return from the Chase,\" a prehistoric scene, purchased by\r\nthe Government; \"The Forge,\" in the Museum of Rouen, where is also a\r\n\"Souvenir of Amsterdam.\" Portrait of Benjamin-Constant and several other\r\nworks of Mlle. Delasalle are in the Luxembourg; other pictures in the\r\ncollections Demidoff, Coquelin, Georges Petit, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the Salon des Artistes Français, 1902, this artist exhibited the\r\nportrait of M. Constant and the \"Roof-Maker.\" At the Salon des\r\nBeaux-Arts, 1903, \"The Park at Greenwich,\" \"The Pont Neuf,\" \"On the\r\nThames,\" and a portrait in oils; and in water-colors, \"The Coliseum,\r\nRome,\" \"A Tiger Drinking,\" \"A Lion Eating,\" \"Head of a Lion,\" \"The\r\nForge,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn the _Magazine of Art_, June, 1902, B. Dufernex writes of Mlle.\r\nDelasalle essentially as follows: This artist came into notice in 1895 by\r\nmeans of her picture of \"Cain and Enoch's Daughters.\" Since then her\r\nannual contributions have demonstrated her gradual acquirement of\r\nunquestionable mastery of her art. Her characteristic energy is such that\r\nher sex cannot be detected in her work; in fact, she was made the first\r\nand only woman member of the International Association of Painters under\r\nthe impression that her pictures--signed simply A. Delasalle--were the\r\nwork of a man. Attracted by the dramatic aspects of human nature, she\r\nfinds congenial subjects in the great efforts of humanity in the struggle\r\nfor life. Her power of observation enables her to give freshness to\r\nhackneyed subjects, as in \"La Forge.\" The attitudes of the workmen, so\r\nsure and decided, turning the half-fused metal are perfect in the\r\nprecision of their combined efforts; the fatigue of the men who are\r\nresting, overwhelmed and stupefied by their exhausting labor, indicates\r\nthe work of a profound thinker; whilst the atmosphere, the play of the\r\ndiffused glow of the molten metal, are the production of an innate\r\ncolorist. Her portrait of Benjamin-Constant represents not only the\r\nmasterful man, but is also the personification of the painter. The\r\nattentive attitude, discerning eye, the openness of the absorbing look,\r\nthe cerebral mask where rests so much tranquil power, the impressive\r\nshape of the leonine face, all combine to make the painting one of the\r\nfinest portraits of the French school.\r\n\r\nShe has a perfect and rare knowledge of the art of drawing and a faculty\r\nfor seizing the character of things. Mlle. Delasalle exhibited her\r\npictures at the Grafton Gallery, London, in 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>DELORME, BERTHE.</b> Medals at Nîmes, Montpellier, Versailles, and\r\nLondon.

In 1874 she became a student\r\nat the Art School in Stuttgart, where she worked under the special\r\ndirection of Funk, and later entered the Art School at Carlsruhe, where\r\nshe was a pupil of Gude. She also received instruction from Hansch. Her\r\npictures are remarkable for their poetic feeling; especially is this true\r\nof \"A Quiet Sea,\" \"The Gollinger Waterfall,\" and \"A Country Party.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>EYCK, MARGARETHA VAN.</b> In Bruges, in the early decades of the\r\nfifteenth century, the Van Eycks were inventing new methods in the\r\npreparation of colors. Their discoveries in this regard assured them an\r\nundying fame, second only to that of their marvellous pictures.\r\n\r\nHere, in the quaint old city--a large part of which we still describe as\r\nmediaeval--in an atmosphere totally unlike that of Italy, beside her\r\ndevout brothers, Hubert and Jan, was Margaretha. When we examine the\r\nminute detail and delicate finish of the pictures of Jan van Eyck, we see\r\na reason why the sister should have been a miniaturist, and do not wonder\r\nthat with such an example before her she should have excelled in this\r\nart. The fame of her miniatures extended even to Southern Italy, where\r\nher name was honorably known.\r\n\r\nWe cannot now point to any pictures as exclusively hers, as she worked in\r\nconcert with her brothers. It is, however, positively known that a\r\nportion of an exquisite Breviary, in the Imperial Library in Paris, was\r\npainted by Margaretha, and that she illustrated other precious and costly\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\nShe was held in high esteem in Bruges and was honored in Ghent by burial\r\nin the Church of St. Bavo, where Hubert van Eyck had been interred. Karl\r\nvan Mander, an early writer on Flemish art, was poetically enthusiastic\r\nin praise of Margaretha, calling her \"a gifted Minerva, who spurned Hymen\r\nand Lucina, and lived in single blessedness.\"\r\n\r\nA Madonna in the National Gallery in London is attributed to Margaretha\r\nvan Eyck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FACIUS, ANGELIKA.</b> Born at Weimar. 1806-87. This artist was\r\ndistinguished as an engraver of medals and gems. Pupil of her father,\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm Facius. Goethe recommended her to Rauch, and in 1827\r\nshe went to Berlin to study in his studio. Under her father's instruction\r\nshe engraved the medal for the celebration at Weimar, 1825, of the\r\njubilee of the Grand Duke Charles Augustus. Under Rauch's direction she\r\nexecuted the medal to commemorate the duke's death. In 1841 she made the\r\nmedal for the convention of naturalists at Jena.\r\n\r\nAfter Neher's designs, she modelled reliefs for the bronze doors at the\r\ncastle of Weimar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FARNCOMB, CAROLINE.</b> Several first prizes in exhibitions in London,\r\nToronto, Montreal, and Ottawa. Member of Women's Art Club, London,\r\nOntario. Born near Toronto, Canada. Pupil of Mr. Judson and Mlle. van\r\nden Broeck in London, Canada, and later of William Chase in New York.\r\nNow studying in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FASSETT, CORNELIA ADÈLE.</b> 1831-1898. Member of the Chicago Academy of\r\nDesign and the Washington Art Club. Born in Owasco, New York. Studied\r\nwater-color painting in New York under an English artist, J. B.\r\nWandesforde. Pupil in Paris of Castiglione, La Tour, and Mathieu. Her\r\nartistic life was spent in Chicago and Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nShe painted numerous portraits in miniature and a large number in oils.\r\nAmong those painted from life were Presidents Grant, Hayes, and Garfield;\r\nVice-President Henry Wilson; Charles Foster, when Governor of Ohio, now\r\nin the State House at Columbus, Ohio; Dr. Rankin, president of Howard\r\nUniversity, Washington; and many other prominent people of Chicago and\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nHer chief work and that by which she is best remembered hangs in the\r\nSenate wing of the United States Capitol. No picture in the Capitol\r\nattracts more attention, and large numbers of people view it daily. It is\r\nthe \"Electoral Commission in Open Session.\" It represents the old Senate\r\nChamber, now the Supreme Court Room, with William M. Evarts making the\r\nopening argument. There are two hundred and fifty-eight portraits of\r\nnotable men and women, prominent in political, literary, scientific, and\r\nsocial circles. Many of these were painted from life.\r\n\r\nThe _Arcadian_, New York, December 15, 1876, in speaking of this picture,\r\nsays: \"Mr. Evarts is addressing the court, and the large number of people\r\npresent are naturally and easily grouped. There is no stiffness nor\r\nawkwardness in the positions, nothing forced in the whole work. There\r\nare, in the crowd, ladies in bright colors to relieve the sombreness of\r\nthe black-coated men, and the effect of the whole picture is pleasing and\r\nartistic, aside from its great value as an historical work.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Washington Capital_, March 17, 1878: \"Mrs. Fassett's 'Electoral\r\nCommission' gives evidence of great merit, and this illustration in oil\r\nof an historical event in the presidential annals of the country, by the\r\npreservation of the likenesses in groups of some of the principal actors,\r\nand a few leading correspondents of the press, will be valuable. This\r\npicture we safely predict will be a landmark in the history of the nation\r\nthat will never be erased. It memorizes a most remarkable crisis in our\r\nlife, and perpetuates, both by reason of its intrinsic value as a chapter\r\nof history and its intrinsic worth as an art production, the incident it\r\nrepresents and the name of the artist.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Washington Star_, October, 1903, an article appeared from which I\r\nquote as follows: \"On the walls of the beautiful tessellated corridor of\r\nthe eastern gallery floor of the Senate wing of the Capitol at\r\nWashington, just opposite the door of the caucus room of the Senate\r\nDemocrats, hangs a large oil painting that never fails to attract the\r\nkeenest curiosity of sightseers and legislators alike. And for good\r\nreason: that painting depicts in glowing colors a scene of momentous\r\nimport, a chapter of American political history of graver consequence and\r\nmore far-reaching results than any other since the Civil War. The printed\r\nlegend on the frame of the picture reads:\r\n\r\n\"'The Florida case before the electoral commission, February 5, 1877.\r\nPainted from life sittings in the United States Supreme Court room by\r\nCornelia Adèle Fassett.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The painting belongs to Congress, having been purchased from the artist\r\nfor $15,000. As you face the picture the portraits of two hundred and\r\nfifty-eight men and women, who, twenty-six years ago, were part and\r\nparcel of the legislative, executive, judicial, social, and journalistic\r\nlife of Washington, look straight at you as if they were still living and\r\nbreathing things, as, indeed, many of them are. As a work of art the\r\npicture is unique, for each face is so turned that the features can\r\neasily be studied, and the likenesses of nearly all are so faithful as to\r\nbe a source of constant wonder and delight.\"--_David S. Barry_, in\r\n_Pearson's Magazine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FAUVEAU, FÉLICIE DE.</b> Second-class medal at Florence in 1827, when\r\nshe made her début by exhibiting a statue, \"The Abbot,\" and a group,\r\n\"Queen Christine and Monaldeschi.\" Born in Florence, of French parents,\r\nabout 1802. For political reasons she was forced to leave Florence about\r\n1834, when she went to Belgium, but later returned to her native city.\r\n\r\nAmong her best works are \"St. George and the Dragon,\" bronze; the\r\n\"Martyrdom of St. Dorothea,\" \"Judith with the Head of Holofernes,\" \"St.\r\nGenoveva,\" marble, and a monument to Dante.\r\n\r\nHer works display a wonderful skill in the use of drapery and a purity of\r\ntaste in composition.

EUGÉNIE JULIETTE.</b> Honorable mention at Salon,\r\n1898; the same at the Paris Exposition, 1900; third-class medal at Salon,\r\n1903; first prize of the Union of Women Painters and Sculptors, 1902;\r\nchevalier of the Order Nichan Iftikar; Officer of Public Instruction.\r\nMember of the Association of Baron Taylor, of the Société des Artistes\r\nFrançais, of the Union of Women Painters and Sculptors, and of the\r\nAssociation of Professors of Design of the City of Paris. Born at Noyen\r\n(Sarthe). Pupil of P. V. Galland, Albert Maignan, and G. Saintpierre.\r\n\r\nMme. Faux-Froidure's pictures are principally of fruit and flowers, and\r\nthree have been purchased by the Government. One, \"Raisins\" (Grapes), is\r\nin the Museum at Commerey; a second, \"Hortensias\" (Hydrangeas), is in the\r\nMuseum of Mans; the third, which was in the Salon of 1903, has not yet\r\nbeen placed. In 1899 she exhibited a large water-color called \"La Barque\r\nfleurie,\" which was much admired and was reproduced in \"L'Illustration.\"\r\nHer water-color of \"Clematis and Virginia Creeper\" is in the Museum at\r\nTunis. In the summer exhibition of 1903, at Évreux, this artist's\r\n\"Peonies\" and \"Iris\" were delightfully painted--full of freshness and\r\nbrilliancy, such as would be the despair of a less skilful hand.\r\n\r\nAt the Limoges Exposition, May to November, 1903, Mme. Faux-Froidure was\r\nannounced as hors concours in water-colors.\r\n\r\nLa Société Français des Amis des Arts purchased from the Salon, 1903, two\r\nwater-colors by Mme. Faux-Froidure--\"Roses\" and \"Loose Flowers,\" or\r\n\"Jonchée fleurie.\"\r\n\r\nHer pictures at the Exposition at Toulouse, spring of 1903, were much\r\nadmired. In one she had most skilfully arranged \"Peaches and Grapes.\" The\r\ncolor was truthful and delicate. The result was a most artistic picture,\r\nin which the art was concealed and nature alone was manifest. A second\r\npicture of \"Zinnias\" was equally admirable in the painting of the\r\nflowers, while that of the table on which they were placed was not quite\r\ntrue in its perspective.\r\n\r\nOf a triptych, called the \"Life of Roses,\" exhibited at the Salon des\r\nArtistes Français, 1903, Jules de Saint Hilaire writes: \"Mme.\r\nFaux-Froidure was inspired when she painted her charming triptych of\r\n'Rose Life.' In the compartment on the left the roses are twined in a\r\ncrown resembling those worn in processions; in the centre, in all its\r\ndazzling beauty, the red rose, the rose of love, is enthroned; while the\r\npanel on the right is consecrated to the faded rose--the souvenir rose,\r\nshrivelled, and lying beside the little casket which it still perfumes\r\nwith its old-time sweetness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FISCHER, CLARA ELIZABETH.</b> Born in Berlin, 1856. Studied under\r\nBiermann six years, and later under Julius Jacob. Her pictures are\r\nportraits and genre subjects.

She first studied under a\r\nwoman portrait painter in Berlin; later she was a pupil of Frische in\r\nDüsseldorf, of Robie in Brussels, and of Hertel and Skarbina in Berlin.\r\n\r\nShe makes a specialty of flowers, fruit, and still-life; her fruit and\r\nflower pieces are beautiful, and her pictures of the victims of the chase\r\nare excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FLESCH-BRUNNENGEN, LUMA VON.</b> Born in Brünn in 1856. In Vienna she\r\nworked under Schöner, the interpreter of Venetian and Oriental life, and\r\nlater in Munich she acquired technical facility under Frithjof Smith.\r\nTravels in Italy, France, and Northern Africa furnished many of her\r\nthemes--mostly interiors with figures, in which the entering light is\r\nskilfully managed. \"The Embroiderers,\" showing three characteristic\r\nfigures, who watch the first attempt of their seriously earnest pupil, is\r\nfull of humor. In sharp contrast to this is a \"Madonna under the Cross,\"\r\nexhibited at Berlin in 1895, in which the mother's anguish is most\r\nsympathetically rendered. \"Devotion,\" \"Shelterless,\" and the \"Kitchen\r\nGarden\" are among the paintings which have won her an excellent\r\nreputation as a genre painter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FLEURY, MME.

Died in 1877. Without\r\na master, in the quiet of a country village, Miss Foley modelled busts in\r\nchalk and carved small figures in wood. At length she made some\r\nreputation in Boston, where she cut portraits and ideal heads in cameo.\r\nShe went to Rome and remained there.

It is simple, absolute truth, embodied\r\nin marble.\"--_Tuckerman's Book of the Artists._\r\n\r\n\"Miss Foley's exquisite medallions and sculptures ought to be reproduced\r\nin photograph.

The _Journal des Arts_, giving an account of\r\nthe exhibition at Rheims, summer, 1903, says: \"The portraits here are not\r\nso numerous as one might expect, but they are too fine to be overlooked.\r\nMlle. Jenny Fontaine has, for a long time, held a distinguished place as\r\na _portraitiste_ in our Salons, and two of her works are here: a portrait\r\nof a young girl and one of General Jeanningros.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FONTANA, LAVINIA.</b> Born in Bologna, 1552. Her father was a\r\ndistinguished portrait painter in Rome in the time of Pope Julius III.,\r\nbut the work of his daughter was preferred before his own. She was\r\nelected to the Academy of Rome, while her charms were extolled in poetry\r\nand prose.\r\n\r\nPope Gregory XIII. made her his painter-in-ordinary. Patrician ladies,\r\ncardinals, and Roman nobles contended for the privilege of having their\r\nportraits from her hand. Men of rank and scholars paid court to her,\r\nbut, with a waywardness not altogether uncommon, she married a man who\r\nwas even thought to be lacking in sense.\r\n\r\nOne of her two daughters was blind of one eye, and her only son was so\r\nsimple that the loungers in the antechamber of the Pope were accustomed\r\nto amuse themselves with his want of wit. She is said to have died of a\r\nbroken heart after the death of this son, and her portrait of him is\r\nconsidered her masterpiece.\r\n\r\nHer own portrait was one of her most distinguished works, and though it\r\nis in possession of her husband's family, the Zappi, of Imola, it may be\r\njudged by an engraving after it in Rossini's \"History of Italian\r\nPainting.\"\r\n\r\nMany portraits by Lavinia Fontana are in the private collections of\r\nItalian families for whom they were painted. In the Gallery of Bologna\r\nthere is a night-scene, the \"Nativity of the Virgin,\" by her, and in the\r\nEscorial is a Madonna lifting a veil to regard the sleeping Jesus, while\r\nSS. Joseph and John stand near by.\r\n\r\nIn the churches of San Giacomo Maggiore and of the Madonna del Baracano,\r\nboth in Bologna, are Fontana's pictures of the \"Madonna with Saints.\" In\r\nPieve di Cento are two of her works--a \"Madonna\" and an \"Ascension.\" It\r\nis said that several pictures by this artist are in England, but I have\r\nfailed to find to what collections they belong.\r\n\r\nLavinia Fontana was a distinguished woman in a notable age, and if, in\r\ntranslating the tributes that were paid her by the authors of her day, we\r\nshould faithfully render their superlatives, these writings would seem\r\nabsurd in their exaggerations, and our comparatively cold adjectives\r\nwould be taxed beyond their power of expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FONTANA, VERONICA.</b> Born in 1576. A pupil of Elisabetta Sirani, who\r\ndevoted herself to etching and wood-engraving. She is known from her\r\nexceedingly fine, delicate portraits on wood and etchings of scenes from\r\nthe life of the Madonna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FOORD, MISS J.</b> A painter of plants and flowers, which are much\r\npraised. An article in the _Studio_, July, 1901, says: \"Miss Foord, by\r\npatient and observant study from nature, has given us a very pleasing,\r\nnew form of useful work, that has traits in common; with the\r\nillustrations to be found in the excellent botanical books of the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century.\" After praising the works of this\r\nartist, attention is called to her valuable book, \"Decorative Flower\r\nStudies,\" illustrated with forty plates printed in colors.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FOOTE, MARY HALLOCK.</b> Born in Milton, New York.

Mrs. Foote is a member of the Alumni of the School of Design.\r\n\r\nHer illustrations have been exhibited by the publishers for whom they\r\nwere made. In the beginning her work was suited to the taste and custom\r\nof the time. She illustrated the so-called \"Gift Books\" and poems in the\r\nelaborate fashion of the period. Later she was occupied principally in\r\nillustrations for the Century Company and Houghton, Mifflin & Co.

As an\r\nartist she stands shoulder to shoulder with the very best; she has taste\r\nand fancy, without which she could not be an artist. But what strikes one\r\nabout her most is summed up in the word 'ability.' She is essentially\r\nable. The work which that wonderful left hand of hers finds to do, it\r\ndoes with a certainty that makes most other work look tentative beside\r\nhers. The gestures and poses she chooses in her models show how little\r\nshe fears drawing, while the gistness of her criticism has a most solvent\r\neffect in dissolving the doubts that hover round the making of pictures.\"\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FORTI, ENRICA.</b> Rome.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FORTIN DE COOL, DELFINA.</b> Third-class medal, Madrid, 1864, for the\r\nfollowing works reproduced on porcelain: the \"Conception\" of Murillo,\r\nthe \"Magdalen\" of Antolinez, and the portrait of Alonso Cano by\r\nVelazquez; also a portrait on ivory of a young girl.\r\n\r\nThis artist, who was French by birth, was a pupil of her father.

She returned to Zürich and was\r\nurged to remain in Switzerland, but she was ambitious of further study,\r\nand went again to Florence. She there painted a portrait of the Grand\r\nDuchess Marie of Russia. She turned her attention to decorative painting,\r\nand her success in this may be seen in the facades of the Schmitz villa,\r\nthe Schemboche establishment, and her own home.

In Berlin she had lessons in\r\ndrawing with Liezenmayer, and in color with Max Thedy. She was also a\r\nconstant student at the galleries. She began to work independently when\r\neighteen, and a number of her pictures achieved great popularity, being\r\nreproduced in many art magazines. \"The Little Doctor,\" especially, in\r\nwhich a boy is feeling, with a grave expression of knowledge, the pulse\r\nof his sister's pet kitten, has been widely copied in photographs,\r\nwood-engravings, and in colors. She repeated the picture in varying\r\nforms. She died in Munich, where she was favorably known through such\r\nworks as \"The Village Barber,\" \"Contraband,\" \"The Wonderful Story,\" \"At\r\nthe Sick Bed,\" and \"The Violin Player,\" the last painted the year before\r\nher death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GENTILESCHI, ARTEMISIA.</b> 1590-1642. A daughter of Orazio Gentileschi,\r\nwhom she accompanied to England when he was invited to the court of\r\nCharles I. Artemisia has been called the pupil, and again the friend, of\r\nGuido Reni. Whatever the relation may have been, there is no doubt that\r\nthe manner of her painting was influenced by Guido, and also by her study\r\nof the works of Domenichino.\r\n\r\nWagner says that she excelled her father in portraits, and her own\r\nlikeness, in the gallery at Hampton Court, is a powerful and life-like\r\npicture. King Charles had several pictures from her hand, one of which,\r\n\"David with the Head of Goliath,\" was much esteemed. Her \"Mary Magdalene\"\r\nand \"Judith with the Head of Holofernes\" are in the Pitti Palace. The\r\nlatter work is a proof of her talent. Lanzi says: \"It is a picture of\r\nstrong coloring, of a tone and intensity which inspires awe.\" Mrs.\r\nJameson praised its execution while she regretted its subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alinari, Photo.\r\n\r\nIn the Pitti Gallery, Florence\r\n\r\nJUDITH WITH THE HEAD OF HOLOFERNES\r\n\r\nARTEMISIA GENTILESCHI]\r\n\r\nHer picture of the \"Birth of John the Baptist,\" in the Gallery of the\r\nPrado, is worthy of attention, even in that marvellous collection, where\r\nis also her \"Woman Caressing Pigeons.\" The Historical Society of New York\r\nhas her picture of \"Christ among the Doctors.\"\r\n\r\nAfter her return to Italy from England, this artist was married and\r\nresided in Naples. Several of her letters are in existence. They tell of\r\nthe manner of her life and give an interesting picture of Neapolitan\r\nsociety in her day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GESSLER DE LACROIX, ALEJANDRENA</b>--known in art circles as Madame\r\nAnselma. Gold medal at Cadiz, 1880. Honorary member of the Academy of\r\nCadiz. She has spent some years in Paris, where her works are often seen\r\nin exhibitions. Her medal picture at Cadiz was an \"Adoration of the\r\nCross.\" One of her most successful works is called \"The Choir Boys.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GILES, MISS--MRS. BERNARD JENKIN.</b> This sculptor exhibited a\r\nlife-size marble group, called \"In Memoriam,\" at the Royal Academy in\r\n1900, which attracted much attention. It was graceful in design and of a\r\nsympathetic quality. At an open competition in the London Art Union her\r\n\"Hero\" won the prize. In 1901 she exhibited an ambitious group called\r\n\"After Nineteen Hundred Years, and still They Crucify.\" It was excellent\r\nin modelling, admirable in sentiment, and displayed strength in\r\nconception and execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GINASSI, CATERINA.</b> Born in Rome, 1590. This artist was of noble\r\nfamily, and one of her uncles, a Cardinal, founded the Church of Santa\r\nLucia, in which Caterina, after completing her studies under Lanfranco,\r\npainted several large pictures. After the death of the Cardinal, with\r\nmoney which he had given her for the purpose, Caterina founded a\r\ncloister, with a seminary for the education of girls.\r\n\r\nAs Abbess of this community she proved herself to be of unusual ability.\r\nIn her youth she had been trained in practical affairs as well as in art,\r\nand, although she felt that \"the needle and distaff were enemies to the\r\nbrush and pencil,\" her varied knowledge served her well in the\r\nresponsibilities she had assumed, and at the head of the institution she\r\nhad founded she became as well known for her executive ability as for her\r\npiety.\r\n\r\nLittle as the works of Lanfranco appeal to us, he was a notable artist of\r\nthe Carracci school; Caterina did him honor as her master, and, in the\r\nesteem of her admirers, excelled him as a painter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GIRARDET, BERTHE.</b> Gold medal at the Paris Exposition, 1900;\r\nhonorable mention, Salon des Artistes Français, 1900; ten silver medals\r\nfrom foreign exhibitions. Member of the Société des Artistes Français and\r\nthe Union des femmes peintres et sculpteurs. Born at Marseilles. Her\r\nfather was Swiss and her mother a Miss Rogers of Boston. She was a pupil\r\nfor three months of Antonin-Carlès, Paris. With this exception, Mme.\r\nGirardet writes: \"I studied mostly alone, looking to nature as the best\r\nteacher, and with energetic perseverance trying to give out in a concrete\r\nform all that filled my heart.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD\r\n\r\nBERTHE GIRARDET]\r\n\r\nAmong her works are: \"L'Enfant Malade,\" bought by the city of Paris and\r\nplaced in the Petit Palais des Champs Élysées; a group called the\r\n\"Grandmother's Blessing,\" purchased by the Government and placed in a\r\npublic museum; the bust of an \"Old Woman,\" acquired by the Swiss\r\nGovernment and placed in the Museum of Neuchâtel; a group, the \"Madonna\r\nand Child,\" for which the artist received the gold medal; and two groups\r\nillustrating the prayer, \"Give us this day our daily bread.\" Also\r\nportrait statues and busts belonging to private collections.\r\n\r\nAt the Salon des Artistes Français, 1902, Mme. Girardet exhibited the\r\n\"Grandmother's Blessing\" and \"L'Enfant Malade.\" At the same Salon, 1903,\r\nthe two groups illustrating the Lord's Prayer.\r\n\r\nA writer, G. M., in the _Studio_ of December, 1902, writes: \"Prominent\r\namong the women artists of the day whose talents are attracting attention\r\nis Mme. Berthe Girardet. She has a very delicate and very tender vision\r\nof things, which stamps her work with genuine originality. She does not\r\nseek her subjects far from the life around her; quite the reverse; and\r\ntherein lies the charm of her sculpture--a great, sincere, and simple\r\ncharm, which at once arouses one's emotion. What, for instance, could be\r\nmore poignantly sad than this 'Enfant Malade' group, with the father,\r\nracked with anxiety, bending over the pillow of his fragile little son,\r\nand the mother, already in an attitude of despair, at the foot of the\r\nbed? The whole thing is great in its profound humanity.\r\n\r\n\"The 'Bénédiction de l'Aïeule' is less tragic. Behind the granddaughter,\r\ndelightful in her white veil and dress of a _première communicante_,\r\nstands the old woman, her wrinkled face full of quiet joy. She is\r\nthinking of the past, moved by the melancholy of the bells, and she is\r\nhappy with a happiness with which is mingled something of sorrow and\r\nregret. It is really exquisite. By simple means Mme. Berthe Girardet\r\nobtains broad emotional effects. She won a great and legitimate success\r\nat the Salon of the Société des Artistes Français.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GLEICHEN, COUNTESS.</b> Bronze medal at Paris Exposition, 1900.\r\nHonorable member of Royal Institute of Painters in Water-Colors, of Royal\r\nSociety of Painter Etchers. Sculptor. Pupil of her father, Prince Victor\r\nof Hohenlohe, and of the Slade School, London; also of Professor Legros.\r\nShe has exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy since 1893.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 she completed a life-size statue of Queen Victoria for the\r\nVictoria Hospital, Montreal. The Queen is represented in royal robes,\r\nwith one child asleep on her knee, while another, with its arm in a\r\nsling, stands on the steps of the throne. Shortly before the Queen's\r\ndeath she gave sittings to Countess Gleichen, who then executed a bust of\r\nher majesty, now at the Cheltenham Ladies' College. The Constitutional\r\nClub, London, has her bust of Queen Alexandra, which was seen at the\r\nAcademy in 1895. Her \"Satan\" attracted much attention when exhibited in\r\n1894. He is represented as seated on a throne composed of snakes, while\r\nhe has scales and wings and is armed like a knight. In 1899 her statue of\r\n\"Peace\" was more pleasing, while a hand-mirror of jade and bronze was\r\nmuch admired both in London and Paris, where it was seen in the\r\nExposition of 1900. In 1901 she executed a fountain with a figure of a\r\nnymph for a garden in Paris; a year later, a second fountain for W.\r\nPalmer, Esq., Ascot. She has made a half-length figure of Kubelik. Her\r\nsculptured portraits include those of Sir Henry Ponsonby, Mme. Calvé,\r\nMrs. Walter Palmer, and a bust of the late Queen, in ivory, which she\r\nexhibited in 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GLEICHEN, COUNTESS HELENA.</b>\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GLOAG, ISOBEL LILIAN.</b> Born in London, the daughter of Scotch\r\nparents. Her early studies were made at St. John's Wood Art School,\r\npreparatory to entering the School of the Royal Academy, but the\r\nconservative and academic training of these institutions so displeased\r\nher that she went to the Slade School. Ill health compelled her to put\r\naside all plans for regular study, and she entered Ridley's studio for\r\nprivate instruction, following this with work at the South Kensington\r\nMuseum. After still further study with Raphael Collin in Paris, she\r\nreturned to London and soon had her work accepted at the Royal Academy.\r\nMiss Gloag is reported as saying that women have little sense of\r\ncomposition, a failing which she does not seem to share; in this respect\r\nand as a colorist she is especially strong. \"Rosamond,\" in which the\r\ncharming girl in a purple robe, sitting before an embroidery frame, is\r\nstartled by the shadow of Queen Eleanor bearing the poisoned cup,\r\ndisplays these qualities to great advantage. The leafy bower, the hanging\r\nmantle, show great skill in arrangement and a true instinct for color.\r\n\"The Magic Mantle,\" \"Rapunzel,\" and the \"Miracle of the Roses\" have\r\nall--especially, the first named--made an impression; another and\r\nstrikingly original picture, called the \"Quick and the Dead,\" represents\r\na poorhouse, in the ward of which is a group of old women surrounded by\r\nthe ghosts of men and children. Miss Gloag has also made some admirable\r\ndesigns for stained-glass windows. She has been seriously hampered by\r\nill health, and her achievements in the face of such a drawback are all\r\nthe more remarkable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GODEWYCK, MARGARETTA.</b> Born at Dort, 1627. A pupil of the celebrated\r\npainter, Nicholas Maas. She excelled as a painter of flowers, and was\r\nproficient in both ancient and modern languages. She was called by\r\nauthors of her time, \"the lovely flower of Art and Literature of the\r\nMerwestrom,\" which is a poetical way of saying Dordrecht!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GOLAY, MARY--MME. SPEICH GOLAY.</b> Silver medal at Geneva Exposition,\r\n1896; eighteen medals and rewards gained in the Art Schools of Geneva,\r\nand the highest recompense for excellence in composition and decoration.\r\nMember of the Amis des Beaux-Arts, Geneva; Société vaudoise des Beaux\r\nArts, Lausanne. Born in Geneva and studied there under Mittey for flower\r\npainting, composition, and ceramic decoration; under Gillet for figure\r\npainting.\r\n\r\nMme. Golay has executed a variety of pictures both in oil and\r\nwater-colors. In an exhibition at the Athénée in Geneva, in the autumn of\r\n1902, she exhibited two pictures of sleep, which afforded an almost\r\nstartling contrast. They were called \"Sweet Sleep\" and the \"Eternal\r\nSleep.\" The first was a picture of a beautiful young woman, nude, and\r\nsleeping in the midst of roses, while angels watching her inspire rosy\r\ndreams of life and love. The roses are of all possible shades, rendered\r\nwith wonderful freshness--scarlet roses, golden roses--and in such masses\r\nand so scattered about the nude figure as to give it a character of\r\npurity and modesty. The flesh tints are warm, the figure is supple in\r\neffect, and the whole is a happy picturing of the sleep and dream of a\r\nlovely young woman who has thrown herself down in the carelessness of\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nIt required an effort of will to turn to the second picture. Here lies\r\nanother young woman, in her white shroud, surrounded with lilies as white\r\nas her face, on which pain has left its traces. In the artistic speech of\r\nthe present day, it is a symphony in white. The figure is as rigid as the\r\nother is supple; it is frightfully immovable--and yet the drawing is not\r\nexaggerated in its firmness. Certainly these contrasting pictures witness\r\nto the skill of the artist. Without doubt the last is by far the most\r\ndifficult, but Mme. Golay has known how to conquer its obstacles.\r\n\r\nA third picture by this artist in the exhibition is called the \"Abundance\r\nof Spring.\" Mme. Golay's reputation as a flower painter has been so long\r\nestablished that one need not dwell on the excellence of the work. A\r\nwriter in the Geneva _Tribune_ exclaims: \"One has never seen more\r\nbrilliant peonies, more vigorous or finer branches of lilacs, or iris\r\nmore delicate and distinguished. How they breathe--how they live--how\r\nthey smile--these ephemeral blossoms!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GONZALEZ, INÉS.</b> Member of the Academy San Carlos of Valencia. In the\r\nexpositions of 1845 and 1846 in that city she was represented by several\r\nminiatures, one of which, \"Dido,\" was much admired. Another--the portrait\r\nof the Baron of Santa Barbara--was acquired by the Economic Society of\r\nValencia. In the Provincial Museum is her picture of the \"Two Smokers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GRANBY, MARCHIONESS OF.</b> Replies as follows to circular: \"Lady Granby\r\nhas been written about by Miss Tomlinson, 20 Wigmore Street, London, W.\r\nAnd I advise you if you really want any information to get it from her.\r\nV.

She has executed portraits of\r\nQueen Victoria, Georgina, Lady Dudley, the Duke of Argyll, Mr. C.\r\nParnell, M.P., and Sir Francis Grant, P.R.A.\r\n\r\nHer memorial work includes a relief of Dean Stanley, Royal Chapel,\r\nWindsor; and a relief of Mr. Fawcett, M.P., on the Thames Embankment. The\r\nlate Queen gave Miss Grant several commissions. In Winchester Cathedral\r\nis a screen, on the exterior of Lichfield Cathedral a number of figures,\r\nand in the Cathedral of Edinburgh a reredos, all the work of this artist.\r\nAt the Royal Academy, 1903, she exhibited a medallion portrait in bronze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GRATZ, MARIE.</b> Born at Karlsruhe, 1839.

Born in Ireland. 1820-1897.\r\nStudied under Witherspoon and James and William Hart in New York; under\r\nLambinet in Paris; and at the Pinakothek in Munich. Mrs. Greatorex\r\nvisited England, Paris, Italy, and Germany, spending a summer in\r\nNuremberg and one in Ober-Ammergau.\r\n\r\nAmong her most important works are \"Bloomingdale,\" which was purchased by\r\nMr. Robert Hoe; \"Château of Madame Cliffe,\" the property of Dykeman van\r\nDoren; \"Landscape, Amsterdam\"; pictures of \"Bloomingdale Church,\" \"St.\r\nPaul's Church,\" and the \"North Dutch Church,\" all painted on panels taken\r\nfrom these churches.\r\n\r\nMrs. Greatorex illustrated the \"Homes of Ober-Ammergau\" with etchings,\r\npublished in Munich in 1871; also \"Summer Etchings in Colorado,\"\r\npublished in 1874; and \"Old New York from the Battery to Bloomingdale,\"\r\npublished in 1875. Eighteen of the drawings for the \"Old New York\" were\r\nat the Philadelphia Exhibition, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GREENAWAY, KATE.</b> Member of the Royal Institute of Painters in\r\nWater-Colors, 1890. Born in London. 1846-1901. Her father was a\r\nwell-known wood-engraver. Miss Greenaway first studied her art at the\r\nSouth Kensington School; then at Heatherley's life class and at the Slade\r\nSchool. She began to exhibit at the Dudley Gallery in 1868.\r\n\r\nHer Christmas cards first attracted general attention to her as an\r\nartist. Their quaint beauty and truthful drawing in depicting children,\r\nyoung girls, flowers, and landscape soon made them more popular than the\r\nsimilar work of other artists. These cards sold by thousands on both\r\nsides of the Atlantic and secured consideration for any other work she\r\nmight do.\r\n\r\nShe soon made illustrations for _Little Folks_ and the _London News_. In\r\n1879 \"Under the Window\" appeared, and one hundred and fifty thousand\r\ncopies were sold; it was also translated into French and German. The\r\n\"Birthday Book,\" \"Mother Goose,\" and \"Little Ann\" followed and were\r\naccorded the heartiest welcome. It is said that for the above four toy\r\nbooks she received $40,000. Wherever they went--and they were in all\r\ncivilized countries--they were applauded by artists and critics and loved\r\nby all classes of women and children. One can but hope that Kate\r\nGreenaway realized the world-wide pleasure she gave to children.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition of her works at the Gallery of the Fine Arts Society,\r\nsince her death, was even more beautiful than was anticipated. The grace,\r\ndelicacy, and tenderness with which her little people were created\r\nimpressed one in an entire collection as no single book or picture could\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that \"Kate Greenaway dressed the children of two\r\ncontinents,\" and, indeed, her revival of the costumes of a hundred years\r\nago was delightful for the children and for everybody who saw them.\r\n\r\nAmong her papers after her death many verses were found. Had she lived\r\nshe would doubtless have acquired the courage to give them to the world.\r\nShe was shy of strangers and the public; had few intimates, but of those\r\nfew was very fond; the charm of her character was great--indeed, her\r\nfriends could discover no faults in her; her personality and presence\r\nwere as lovely to them as were her exquisite flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GREENE, MARY SHEPARD.</b> Third-class medal, 1900, second-class medal,\r\n1902, at Salon des Artistes Français. Her picture of 1902 is thus spoken\r\nof in _Success_, September of that year:\r\n\r\n\"'Une Petite Histoire' is the title of Miss Mary Shepard Greene's\r\ngraceful canvas. The lithe and youthful figure of a girl is extended upon\r\na straight-backed settle in somewhat of a Récamier pose. She is intently\r\noccupied in the perusal of a book. The turn of the head, the careless\r\nattitude, and the flesh tints of throat and face are all admirably\r\nrendered. The diaphanous quality of the girlish costume is skilfully\r\nworked out, as are also the accessories of the room. Miss Greene's work\r\nmust commend itself to those who recognize the true in art. Technical\r\ndexterity and a fine discrimination of color are attributes of this\r\nconscientious artist's work. She has a rare idea of grace and great\r\nstrength of treatment.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Greene's canvas has a charm all its own, and is essentially\r\nwomanly, while at the same time it is not lacking in character. Hailing\r\nfrom New England, her first training was in Brooklyn, under Professor\r\nWhittaker, from whom she received much encouragement. Afterward she came\r\nunder the influence of Herbert Adams, and, after pursuing her studies\r\nwith that renowned artist, she went to Paris, where she was received as a\r\npupil by Raphael Collin.

They wear the white Breton caps, and but for these--in the\r\nreproduction that I have--it seems a gloomy picture; but one cannot judge\r\nof color from the black and white. The net is well done, as are the\r\nhands, and the whole work is true to the character of such a scene in the\r\ncountry of these hard-working women.\r\n\r\nMme. Guyon is much esteemed as a teacher. She has been an instructor and\r\nadviser to the Princess Mathilde, and has had many young ladies in her\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nIn her portraits she succeeds in revealing the individual characteristics\r\nof her subjects and bringing out that which is sometimes a revelation to\r\nthemselves in a pronounced manner.

At a recent exhibition of the Society of American\r\nArtists, Miss Heustis's genre portrait called \"The Recitation\" was most\r\nattractive and well painted.

These are but a small number of the\r\nportraits by this artist. She is clever in posing her sitters, manages\r\nthe effect of light with skill and judgement, and renders the various\r\nkinds of textures to excellent advantage.\r\n\r\nAs an illustrator Miss Heustis has been employed by _St. Nicholas,\r\nScribner's_, and _Harper's Magazine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HILL, AMELIA R.</b> A native of Dunfermline, she lived many years in\r\nEdinburgh.

They are decidedly\r\nindividual in character. No matter how simple her arrangements, she gives\r\nher pictures a cachet of distinction. It may be \"a lady in a black gown\r\nwith a black aigrette in her hair and a background of delicate turquoise\r\nblue, or the delicate profile of a red-haired beauty, outlined against\r\ntapestry, the snowy head and shoulders rising out of dusky brown velvet;\r\nbut the effect is gem-like, a revelation of exquisite coloring that is\r\nentirely artistic.\"\r\n\r\n\"An attractive work,\" reproduced here, \"may be called a miniature\r\npicture. It is a portrait of a little lady, apparently six or seven years\r\nold, in an artistic old-fashioned gown, the bodice low in neck and cut in\r\nsharp point at the waist line in front; elbow sleeves, slippers with\r\nlarge rosettes, just peeping out from her dress, her feet not touching\r\nthe floor, so high is she seated. Her hair, curling about her face, is\r\nheld back by a ribbon bandeau in front; one long, heavy curl rests on the\r\nleft side of her neck, and is surmounted by a big butterfly bow. The\r\ncostume and pose are delightful and striking at first sight, but the more\r\nthe picture is studied the more the face attracts the attention it\r\nmerits. It is a sweet little girl's face, modest and sensible. She is\r\nholding the arm of her seat with a sort of determination to sit that way\r\nand be looked at so long as she must, but her expression shows that she\r\nis thinking hard of something that she intends to do so soon as she can\r\njump down and run away to her more interesting occupations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HINMAN, LEANA MCLENNAN.</b>\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HITZ, DORA.</b> Born at Altdorf, near Nuremberg, 1856. During eight\r\nyears she worked under the direction of Lindenschmit, 1870-1878. She was\r\nthen invited to Bucharest by the Queen of Roumania, \"Carmen Sylva.\" Here\r\nthe artist illustrated the Queen's poem, \"Ada,\" with a series of\r\nwater-color sketches, and painted two landscapes from Roumanian scenery.\r\nBetween 1883 and 1886 she made sketches for the mural decoration of the\r\nmusic-room at the castle of Sinoia. Later, in Brittany and Normandy, she\r\nmade illustrations for the fisher-romances of Pierre Loti. At Berlin, in\r\n1891-1892, she painted portraits, and then retired to Charlottenburg. Her\r\nexhibition of two beautiful pictures in gouache, at Dresden, in 1892,\r\nbrought her into notice, and her grasp of her subjects and her method of\r\nexecution were much commended.\r\n\r\nFräulein Hitz could not stem the \"classic\" art creed of Berlin, where the\r\n\"new idealism\" is spurned. She ventured to exhibit some portraits and\r\nstudies there in 1894, and was most unfavorably criticised. At Munich,\r\nhowever, in 1895, her exhibition was much admired at the \"Secession.\"\r\nAgain, in 1898, she exhibited, in Berlin, at the Union of Eleven, a\r\nportrait of a young girl, which was received with no more favor than was\r\nshown her previous works. In the same year, at the \"Livre Esthetique,\" in\r\nBrussels, her pictures were thought to combine a charming grace with a\r\nsure sense of light effects, in which the predominating tone was a deep\r\nsilver gray. A portrait by this artist was exhibited at a Paris Salon in\r\n1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HOFFMANN, FELICITAS.</b> Born in Venice, she died in Dresden, 1760.\r\nPupil of Rosalba Camera. There are four pictures in the Dresden Gallery\r\nattributed to her--\"St. George,\" after Correggio; \"Diana with an Italian\r\nGreyhound,\" after Camera; \"Winter,\" a half-length figure by herself; and\r\nher own portrait. Her principal works were religious subjects and\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HOFFMANN-TEDESCO, GIULIA.</b> Prize at the Beatrice Exposition, Naples.\r\nBorn at Wurzburg, 1850. This artist has lived in Italy and made her\r\nartistic success there, her works having been seen in many exhibitions.\r\nHer prize picture at Naples was called \"A Mother's Joy.\" In 1877 she\r\nexhibited in the same city \"Sappho\" and \"A Mother,\" which were much\r\nadmired; at Turin, 1880, \"On the Water\" and \"The Dance\" were seen; at\r\nMilan, 1881, she exhibited \"Timon of Athens\" and a \"Sunset\"; at Rome,\r\n1883, \"A Gipsy Girl\" and \"Flowers.\" Her flower pictures are excellent;\r\nthey are represented with truth, spirit, and grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HOGARTH, MARY.</b> Exhibits regularly at the New English Art Club, and\r\noccasionally at the New Gallery. Born at Barton-on-Humber, Lincolnshire.\r\nPupil of the Slade School under Prof. Fred Brown and P. Wilson Steer.\r\n\r\nMiss Hogarth's contribution to the exhibition of the New English Art\r\nClub, 1902, was called \"The Green Shutters,\" a very peculiar title for\r\nwhat was, in fact, a picture of the Ponte Vecchio and its surroundings,\r\nin Florence. It was interesting. It was scarcely a painting; a tinted\r\nsketch would be a better name for it. It was an actual portrait of the\r\nscene, and skilfully done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HORMUTH-KOLLMORGEN, MARGARETHE.</b> Born at Heidelberg, 1858. Pupil of\r\nFerdinand Keller at Carlsruhe. Married the artist Kollmorgen, 1882. This\r\npainter of flowers and still-life has also devoted herself to decorative\r\nwork, mural designs, fire-screens, etc., in which she has been\r\nsuccessful.

Two\r\nheads, \"Daphne\" and \"Medusa,\" executed soon after she went to Rome, were\r\npraised by critics of authority. \"Will-o'-the-Wisp,\" \"Puck,\" \"Sleeping\r\nFaun,\" \"Waking Faun,\" and \"Zenobia in Chains\" followed each other\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nMiss Hosmer made a portrait statue of \"Maria Sophia, Queen of the\r\nSicilies,\" and a monument to an English lady to be placed in a church in\r\nRome. Her \"Beatrice Cenci\" has been much admired; it is in the Public\r\nLibrary at St. Louis, and her statue of Thomas H. Benton is in a square\r\nof the same city.\r\n\r\nFor Lady Ashburton Miss Hosmer made her Triton and Mermaid Fountains, and\r\na Siren Fountain for Lady Marian Alford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HOUSTON, CAROLINE A.</b>\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HOUSTON, FRANCES C.</b> Bronze medal at Atlanta Exposition; honorable\r\nmention at Paris Exposition, 1900.

This sculptor\r\nwas but fifteen years old when she was commissioned to make a life-size\r\nstatue of Abraham Lincoln, who sat for his bust; her completed statue of\r\nhim is in the rotunda of the Capitol at Washington. Congress then gave\r\nher the commission for the heroic statue of Admiral Farragut, now in\r\nFarragut Square, Washington. These are the only two statues that the\r\nUnited States Government has ordered of a woman.\r\n\r\nThis artist has executed ideal statues and several bust portraits of\r\ndistinguished men. Of these the bust of Ezra Cornell is at Cornell\r\nUniversity; that of Mayor Powell in the City Hall of Brooklyn, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HUDSON, GRACE.</b> Gold medal at Hopkins Institute, San Francisco;\r\nsilver medal at Preliminary World's Fair Exhibition of Pacific States;\r\nand medals and honorable mention at several California State exhibitions.\r\nBorn in Potter Valley, California. Studied at Hopkins Art Institute, San\r\nFrancisco, under Virgil Williams and Oscar Kunath.\r\n\r\nPaints genre subjects, some of which are \"Captain John,\" in National\r\nMuseum; \"Laughing Child,\" in C. P. Huntington Collection; \"Who Comes?\" in\r\nprivate hands in Denver, etc.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hudson's pictures of Indians, the Pomas especially, are very\r\ninteresting, although when one sees the living article one wonders how a\r\npicture of him, conscientiously painted and truthful in detail, can be so\r\nlittle repulsive--or, in fact, not repulsive at all. At all events, Mrs.\r\nHudson has no worthy rival in painting California Indians. If we do not\r\nsympathize with her choice of subjects, we are compelled to acknowledge\r\nthat her pictures are full of interest and emphasize the power of this\r\nartist in keeping them above a wearisome commonplace.\r\n\r\nHer Indian children are attractive, we must admit, and her \"Poma Bride,\"\r\nseated in the midst of the baskets that are her dower, is a picture which\r\ncuriously attracts and holds the attention. Her compositions are simple,\r\nand it can only be a rare skill in their treatment that gives them the\r\nvalue that is generally accorded them by critics, who, while approving\r\nthem, are all the time conscious of surprise at themselves for doing so,\r\nand of an unanswered Why? which persists in presenting itself to their\r\nthought when seeing or thinking of these pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HULBERT, MRS.

Among\r\nthe most important are \"The Stream, South Egremont,\" which is in a\r\nprivate gallery in Denver; \"In the Woods\" belongs to Mr. Whiting, of\r\nGreat Barrington; and \"Sunlight and Shadow\" to Mr. Benedict, Albany, New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hulbert is also favorably known as an illustrator and decorative\r\ndesigner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HUNTER, MARY Y.</b> Four silver medals at Royal Academy Schools\r\nExhibitions; diploma for silver medal, Woman's International Exhibition,\r\nEarl's Court, London. Member of Society of Painters in Tempera. Born in\r\nNew Zealand. Studied at Royal Academy Schools.\r\n\r\nThe following list of the titles of Mrs. Hunter's works will give an idea\r\nof the subjects she affects: \"Dante and Beatrice,\" \"Joy to the Laborer,\"\r\n\"An Italian Garden,\" \"Where shall Wisdom be Found?\" and the\r\n\"Roadmenders,\" in Academy Exhibition, 1903.\r\n\r\nThe only work of Mrs. Hunter's that I have seen is the \"Dante and\r\nBeatrice,\" Academy, 1900, and the impression I received leads me to think\r\nan article in the _Studio,_ June, 1903, a just estimate of her work. It\r\nis by A. L. Baldry, who writes: \"In the band of young artists who are at\r\nthe present time building up sound reputations which promise to be\r\npermanent, places of much prominence must be assigned to Mr. J. Young\r\nHunter and his wife. Though neither of them has been before the public\r\nfor any considerable period, they have already, by a succession of\r\nnotable works, earned the right to an amount of attention which, as a\r\nrule, can be claimed only by workers who have a large fund of experience\r\nto draw upon. But though they have been more than ordinarily successful\r\nin establishing themselves among the few contemporary painters whose\r\nperformances are worth watching, they have not sprung suddenly into\r\nnotice by some special achievement or by doing work so sensational that\r\nit would not fail to set people talking. There has been no spasmodic\r\nbrilliancy in their progress, none of that strange alternation of\r\nmasterly accomplishment and hesitating effort which is apt at times to\r\nmark the earlier stages of the life of an artist who may or may not\r\nattain greatness in his later years. They have gone forward steadily year\r\nby year, amplifying their methods and widening the range of their\r\nconvictions; and there has been no moment since they made their first\r\nappeal to the public at which they can be said to have shown any\r\ndiminution in the earnestness of their artistic intentions.\r\n\r\n\"The school to which they belong is one which has latterly gathered to\r\nitself a very large number of adherents among the younger painters--a\r\nschool that, for want of a better name, can be called that of the new\r\nPre-Raphaelites. It has grown up, apparently, as an expression of the\r\nreaction which has recently set in against the realistic beliefs taught\r\nso assiduously a quarter of a century ago. At the end of the seventies\r\nthere was a prevailing idea that the only mission of the artist was to\r\nrecord with absolute fidelity the facts of nature.... To-day the fallacy\r\nof that creed is properly recognized, and the artists on whom we have to\r\ndepend in the immediate future for memorable works have substituted for\r\nit something much more reasonable.... There runs through this new school\r\na vein of romantic fantasy which all thinking people can appreciate,\r\nbecause it leads to the production of pictures which appeal, not only to\r\nthe eye by their attractiveness of aspect, but also to the mind by their\r\ncharm of sentiment.... It is because Mr. Young Hunter and his wife have\r\ncarried out consistently the best principles of this school that they\r\nhave, in a career of some half-dozen years, established themselves as\r\npainters of noteworthy prominence. Their romanticism has always been free\r\nfrom exaggeration and from that morbidity of subject and treatment which\r\nis occasionally a defect in the work of young artists. They have kept\r\ntheir art wholesome and sincere, and they have cultivated judiciously\r\nthose tendencies in it which justify most completely the development of\r\nthe new Pre-Raphaelitism. They are, indeed, standing examples of the\r\nvalue of this movement, which seems destined to make upon history a mark\r\nalmost as definite as that left by the original Brotherhood in the middle\r\nof the nineteenth century. By their help, and that of the group to which\r\nthey belong, a new artistic fashion is being established, a fashion of a\r\nnovel sort, for its hold upon the public is a result not of some\r\nirrational popular craze, but of the fascinating arguments which are put\r\ninto visible shape by the painters themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>HYATT, HARRIET RANDOLPH--MRS.

She has also made a bust of\r\nEmanuele Filiberto; and in terra-cotta a bust of Oicetta Doria, the\r\nfifteenth-century heroine of Mitylene. She has executed a number of\r\ndecorative and monumental works, and receives many commissions from both\r\nItalians and foreigners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>INGLIS, HESTER.</b> This artist lived in the last half of the sixteenth\r\nand in the early decades of the seventeenth century. In the Library of\r\nChrist Church College, Oxford, there is an example of the Psalms, in\r\nFrench, written and decorated by her, which formerly belonged to Queen\r\nElizabeth. In the Royal Library of the British Museum there is also a\r\n\"Book of Emblems\" from her hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ITASSE, JEANNE.</b> Honorable mention, Paris Salon, 1888, and the purse\r\nof the city of Paris; at Paris Exposition, honorable mention, 1889;\r\ntravelling purse, 1891; medal at Chicago Exposition, 1893; medal third\r\nclass, Salon, 1896; medal second class, 1899; silver medal, Paris\r\nExposition, 1900. Member of Société des Artistes Français, Société Libre,\r\nSociété des prix du Salon et boursiers de voyage. Born in Paris. Pupil of\r\nher father.\r\n\r\nSeveral works of this sculptor have been purchased by the Government and\r\nare in the Bureaux of Ministers or in provincial museums. A \"Bacchante\"\r\nis in the Museum at Agen; a portrait bust in the Museum of Alger. At\r\nthe Salon of 1902 Mlle Itasse exhibited a \"Madonna\"; in 1903, a portrait\r\nof M, W.\r\n\r\nMlle Itasse knows her art thoroughly. When still a child, at the age when\r\nlittle girls play with dolls, she was in her father's atelier, working in\r\nclay with an irresistible fondness for this occupation, and without\r\nrelaxation making one little object after another, until she acquired\r\nthat admirable surety of execution that one admires in her work--a\r\nquality sometimes lacking in the work of both men and women sculptors.\r\n\r\nSince her début at the Salon of 1886 she has annually exhibited important\r\nworks. In 1887 her bust of the danseuse, Marie Salles, was purchased by\r\nthe Government for the Opera; in 1888 she exhibited a plaster statue, the\r\n\"Young Scholar,\" and the following year the bust of her father; in 1890 a\r\n\"St. Sebastian\" in high relief; in 1891 an \"Egyptian Harpist,\" which\r\ngained her a traveller's purse and an invitation from the Viceroy of\r\nEgypt; in 1893 a Renaissance bas-relief; in 1894 the superb funeral\r\nmonument dedicated to her father; in 1896 she exhibited, in plaster, the\r\n\"Bacchante,\" which in marble was a brilliant success and gained for her a\r\nsecond-class medal and the palmes académique, while the statue was\r\nacquired by the Government. Mlle. Itasse has also gained official\r\nrecompenses in provincial exhibitions and has richly won the right to\r\nesteem herself mistress of her art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>JACQUEMART, MLLE. NÉLIE.</b> Medals at Paris Salon, 1868, 1869, and\r\n1870. Born in Paris. A very successful portrait painter. Among the\r\nportraits she has exhibited at the Paris Salon are those of Marshal\r\nCanrobert, General d'Aurelle de Paladines, General de Palikao, Count de\r\nChambrun, M. Dufaure, and many others, both ladies and gentlemen. Her\r\nportrait of Thiers in 1872 was greatly admired.\r\n\r\nPaul d'Abrest wrote of Mlle. Jacquemart, in the _Zeitschrift für bildende\r\nKunst:_ \"One feels that this artist does not take her inspirations alone\r\nfrom the sittings of her subjects, but that she finds the best part of\r\nher work in her knowledge of character and from her close study of the\r\npersonnelle of those whom she portrays.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>JANDA, HERMINIE VON.</b> Born at Klosterbruch, 1854. Pupil of Ludwig\r\nHolanska and Hugo Darnaut. Since 1886 her landscapes have been seen in\r\nvarious Austrian exhibitions. One of these was bought for the\r\n\"Franzens-Museum\" at Brünn, while several others were acquired by the\r\nImperial House of Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>JENKS, PHOEBE A. PICKERING.</b> Born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 1849.\r\nMrs. Jenks writes that she has had no teachers.\r\n\r\nHer works, being portraits, are mostly in the homes of their owners, but\r\nthat of the son of T. Jefferson Coolidge, Jr., has been exhibited in the\r\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston, and that of Mrs. William Slater and her son\r\nis in the Slater Museum at Norwich.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOTHER AND CHILD\r\n\r\nPHOEBE JENKS]\r\n\r\nMrs. Jenks has been constantly busy in portrait painting for twenty-seven\r\nyears, and has had no time for clubs and societies. She esteems the fact\r\nof her constant commissions the greatest honor that she could have. She\r\nhas probably painted a greater number of portraits than any other Boston\r\ncontemporary artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>JERICHAU-BAUMANN, ELIZABETH.</b> 1819-1881. Honorable mention, Paris\r\nSalon, 1861. Member of the Academy of Copenhagen. Born in Warsaw. Pupil\r\nof Karl Sohne and Stilke, in Düsseldorf. In Rome she married the Danish\r\nsculptor Jerichau and afterward lived in Copenhagen. She travelled in\r\nEngland, France, Russia, Greece, Turkey, and Egypt.\r\n\r\nHer picture of a \"Polish Woman and Children Leaving Their Home, which had\r\nbeen Destroyed,\" is in the Raczynski Collection, Berlin; \"Polish Peasants\r\nReturning to the Ruins of a Burnt House,\" in the Lansdowne Collection,\r\nLondon; \"A Wounded Soldier Nursed by His Betrothed,\" in the Gallery at\r\nCopenhagen, where is also her portrait of her husband; \"An Icelandic\r\nMaiden,\" in the Kunsthalle, Hamburg. Her picture, \"Reading the Bible,\"\r\nwas painted for Napoleon III. at his request. Mme. Jerichau painted a\r\nportrait of the present Queen of England, in her wedding dress. A large\r\nnumber of her works are in private houses in Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nOne of her most important pictures was a life-size representation of\r\n\"Christian Martyrs in the Catacombs.\" This picture was much talked of in\r\nRome, where it was painted, and the Pope desired to see it. Madame\r\nJerichau took the picture to the Vatican. On seeing it the Pope expressed\r\nsurprise that one who was not of his Church could paint this picture.\r\nMme. Jerichau, hearing this, replied: \"Your Holiness, I am a Christian.\"\r\n\r\nHans Christian Andersen was an intimate friend in the Jerichau family. He\r\nattended the wedding in Rome, and wrote the biographies of Professor and\r\nMme. Jerichau.\r\n\r\nThéophile Gautier once said that but three women in Europe merited the\r\nname of artists--Rosa Bonheur, Henrietta Brown, and Elizabeth Jerichau;\r\nand Cornelius called her \"the one woman in the Düsseldorf School,\"\r\nbecause of her virile manner of painting.\r\n\r\nAmong her important portraits are those of Frederick VII. of Denmark, the\r\nbrothers Grimm, and \"Hans Christian Andersen Reading His Fairy Tales to a\r\nChild.\"\r\n\r\nMme. Jerichau was also an author. In 1874 she published her \"Memories of\r\nYouth,\" and later, with her son, the illustrated \"Pictures of Travel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>JOPLING-ROWE, LOUISE.</b> Member of Royal Society of British Artists,\r\nSociety of Portrait Painters, Pastel Society, Society of Women Artists.\r\nBorn at Manchester, 1843. Pupil of Chaplin in Paris; also studied with\r\nAlfred Stevens.\r\n\r\nSince 1871 Mrs. Jopling has been a constant exhibitor at the Royal\r\nAcademy and other London exhibitions, and frequently also at the Paris\r\nSalon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISS ELLEN TERRY AS \"PORTIA\"\r\n\r\nLOUISE JOPLING ROWE]\r\n\r\nHer pictures are principally portraits and genre subjects. Her first\r\ndecided success was gained in 1874, when she exhibited at the Academy the\r\n\"Japanese Tea Party,\" and from that time she was recognized as an\r\naccomplished artist and received as many commissions as she could\r\nexecute. The Baroness de Rothschild had been convinced of Mrs. Jopling's\r\ntalent before she became an artist, and had given her great encouragement\r\nin the beginning of her career. The portrait of Lord Rothschild, painted\r\nfor Lord Beaconsfield, is thought to be her best work of this kind, but\r\nits owner would not allow it to be exhibited. Her portrait of Ellen\r\nTerry, which hangs in the Lyceum Theatre, was at the Academy in 1883. It\r\nis in the costume of Portia. Mrs. Jopling's pastels are of an unusual\r\nquality, delicate, strong, and brilliant. Her portraits are numerous, and\r\nfrom time to time she has also executed figure subjects.\r\n\r\nOf late years Mrs. Jopling has been much occupied with a School of\r\nPainting. The large number of pupils who wished to study with her made a\r\nschool the best means of teaching them, and has been successful. From the\r\nbeginning they draw from life, and at the same time they also study from\r\nthe antique.\r\n\r\nMany of her pupils receive good prices for their works, and also earn\r\nlarge sums for their portraits in black and white.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jopling writes: \"What I know I chiefly learned alone. Hard work and\r\nthe genius that comes from infinite pains, the eye to see nature, the\r\nheart to feel nature, and the courage to follow nature--these are the\r\nbest qualifications for the artist who would succeed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Art Journal,_ July, 1874, I read: \"'The Five-o'Clock Tea' is the\r\nlargest and most important design we have seen from Mrs. Jopling's hand,\r\nand in the disposition of the various figures and the management of color\r\nit certainly exhibits very remarkable technical gifts. Especially do we\r\nnotice in this lady's work a correct understanding of the laws of tone,\r\nvery rare to find in the works of English painters, giving the artist\r\npower to bring different tints, even if they are not harmonious, into\r\nright relations with one another.\"\r\n\r\nThe above-named picture was sold to the Messrs. Agnew, and was followed\r\nby \"The Modern Cinderella,\" which was seen at the Paris Exposition in\r\n1878; at the Philadelphia Exposition in 1876 she exhibited \"Five Sisters\r\nof York.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jopling is also known as the founder and president of the Society of\r\nthe Immortals. She has written several short tales, some poems, and a\r\nbook called \"Hints to Amateurs.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Royal Academy, 1903, she exhibited \"Hark! Hark! the Lark at\r\nHeaven's Gate Sings,\" which is a picture of a poor girl beside a table,\r\non which she has thrown her work, and leaning back in her chair, with\r\nhands clasped behind her head, is lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>JORIS, SIGNORINA AGNESE</b>--pseudonym, Altissimi. Was accorded the\r\ntitle of professor at the Institute of the Fine Arts, Rome, 1881. She was\r\nsuccessful in a competition for a position in the Scuole Tecniche, Rome,\r\n1888. Honorable mention, Florence, 1890; same at Palermo, 1891 and 1892;\r\nsilver medal of first class and diploma of silver medal, Rome, 1899 and\r\n1900. Member of the Società Cooperativa, Rome. Born in the same city, and\r\npupil of the Institute of Fine Arts and of her brother, Cavaliere\r\nProfessore Pio Joris.\r\n\r\nThis artist writes that a list of her works would be too long and require\r\ntoo much time to write it. They are in oils, pastel, and water-colors,\r\nwith various applications of these to tapestries, etc. She also gives\r\nlessons in these different methods of painting. In a private collection\r\nin New York is her \"Spanish Scene in the Eighteenth Century.\"\r\n\r\nShe painted a \"portrait of the late King Humbert, arranged in the form of\r\na triptych surrounded by a wreath of flowers, painted from some which had\r\nlain on the King's bier.\" She sent this picture to Queen Margharita, \"who\r\nnot only graciously accepted it, but sent the artist a beautiful letter\r\nand a magnificent jewel on which was the Royal Cipher.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KAERLING, HENRIETTE.</b> Born about 1832. Daughter of the artist, J. T.\r\nKaerling, who was her principal teacher. She practised her art as a\r\npainter of portraits, genre subjects, and still-life in Budapest during\r\nsome years before her marriage to the pianist Pacher, with whom she went\r\nto Vienna. She there copied some of the works of the great painters in\r\nthe Gallery, besides doing original work of acknowledged excellence. In\r\naddition to her excellent portraits, she painted in 1851 \"The\r\nGrandmother\"; in 1852, \"A Garland with Religious Emblems\"; in 1855, \"A\r\nCrucifix Wound with Flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KALCKREUTH, COUNTESS MARIA.</b> Medal at Chicago Exposition, 1893.\r\nMember of the Society of Women Artists in Berlin. Born at Düsseldorf.\r\n1857-1897. Much of her artistic life was passed in Munich. Her picture at\r\nChicago was later exhibited at Berlin and was purchased for the\r\nProtestant Chapel at Dachau. It represented \"Christ Raising a Repentant\r\nSinner\"--a strong work, broadly painted. Among her important pictures are\r\n\"In the Sunshine,\" \"Fainthearted,\" \"Discontented,\" and several portraits,\r\nall of which show the various aspects of her artistic talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KAUFFMAN, ANGELICA.</b> An original member of the London Academy. She\r\nwas essentially an Italian artist, since from the age of eleven she lived\r\nin Italy and there studied her art. Such different estimates have been\r\nmade of her works that one may quote a good authority in either praise or\r\nblame of her artistic genius and attainment.\r\n\r\nKugler, a learned, unimpassioned critic, says: \"An easy talent for\r\ncomposition, though of no depth; a feeling for pretty forms, though they\r\nwere often monotonous and empty, and for graceful movement; a coloring\r\nblooming and often warm, though occasionally crude; a superficial but\r\nagreeable execution, and especially a vapid sentimentality in harmony\r\nwith the fashion of the time--all these causes sufficiently account for\r\nher popularity.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alinari, Photo.\r\n\r\nIn the Uffizi, Florence\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF ANGELICA KAUFFMAN\r\n\r\nPAINTED BY HERSELF]\r\n\r\nRaphael Mengs, himself an artist, thus esteems her: \"As an artist she is\r\nthe pride of the female sex in all times and all nations. Nothing is\r\nwanting--composition, coloring, fancy--all are here.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Kate Thompson writes: \"Her works showed no originality nor any great\r\npower of execution, and, while sometimes graceful, were generally weak\r\nand insipid.\"\r\n\r\nFor myself I do not find her worthy of superlative praise or\r\ncondemnation; one cannot deny her grace in design, which was also\r\ncreditably correct; her poetical subjects were pleasing in arrangement;\r\nher historical subjects lacked strength and variety in expression; her\r\ncolor was as harmonious and mellow as that of the best Italian colorists,\r\nalways excepting a small number of the greatest masters, and in all her\r\npictures there is a something--it must have been the individuality of\r\nthe artist--that leads one to entertain a certain fondness for her, even\r\nwhile her shortcomings are fully recognized.\r\n\r\nThe story of Angelica Kauffman's life is of unusual interest. She was\r\nborn at Coire, in the Grisons. 1742-1807. Her father, an artist, had gone\r\nfrom Schwarzenburg to Coire to execute some frescoes in a church, and had\r\nmarried there. When Angelica was a year old the family settled in\r\nMorbegno, in Lombardy. Ten years later, when the child had already shown\r\nher predilection for painting and music, a new home was made for her in\r\nComo, where there were better advantages for her instruction.\r\n\r\nHer progress in music was phenomenal, and for a time she loved her two\r\narts--one as well as the other--and could make no choice between them. In\r\none of her pictures she represented herself as a child, standing between\r\nallegorical figures of Music and Painting.\r\n\r\nThe exquisite scenery about Como, the stately palaces, charming villas,\r\nthe lake with its fairy-like pleasure boats, and the romantic life which\r\nthere surrounded this girl of so impressionable a nature, rapidly\r\ndeveloped the poetic element born with her, which later found expression\r\nthrough her varied talents. During her long life the recollections of the\r\ntwo years she passed at Como were among the most precious memories\r\nassociated with her wandering girlhood.\r\n\r\nFrom Como she was taken to Milan, where she had still better advantages\r\nfor study, and a world of art was opened to her which far exceeded her\r\nmost ardent imaginings. Leonardo had lived and taught in Milan, and his\r\ninfluence with that of other Lombard masters stirred Angelica to her very\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nHer pictures soon attracted the attention of Robert d'Este, who became\r\nher patron and placed her in the care of the Duchess of Carrara. This\r\nearly association with a circle of cultured and elegant men and women was\r\ndoubtless the origin of the self-possession and modest dignity which\r\ncharacterized Angelica Kauffman through life and enabled her becomingly\r\nto accept the honors that were showered upon her.\r\n\r\nHer happy life at Milan ended all too soon. Her mother died, and her\r\nfather decided to return to his native Schwarzenburg to execute some\r\nextensive decorative works in that vicinity. In the interior decoration\r\nof a church Angelica painted in fresco the figures of the twelve apostles\r\nafter engravings from the works of Piazetta.\r\n\r\nThe coarse, homely life of Schwarzenburg was in extreme contrast to that\r\nof Milan and was most uncongenial to a sensitive nature; but Angelica was\r\nsaved from melancholy by the companionship she felt in the grand pine\r\nforests, which soothed her discontent, while her work left her little\r\ntime to pine for the happiness she had left or even to mourn the terrible\r\nloss of her mother.\r\n\r\nHer father's restlessness returned, and they were again in Milan for a\r\nshort time, and then in Florence. Here she studied assiduously awhile,\r\nbut again her father's discontent drove him on, and they went to Rome.\r\n\r\nAngelica was now eighteen years old, and in a measure was prepared to\r\nprofit by the aid and advice of Winckelmann. He conceived an ardent\r\nfriendship for the young artist, and, though no longer young, and engaged\r\nin most important and absorbing research, he found time to interest\r\nhimself in Angelica's welfare, and allowed her to paint his portrait, to\r\nwhich she gave an expression which proved that she had comprehended the\r\nspirit of this remarkable man of threescore years.\r\n\r\nWhile at Rome Angelica received a commission to copy some pictures in\r\nNaples. After completing these she returned to Rome, in 1764, and\r\ncontinued her studies for a time, but her interests were again sacrificed\r\nto her father's unreasonable capriciousness, and she was taken to Bologna\r\nand then to Venice. This constant change was disheartening to Angelica\r\nand of the greatest disadvantage to her study, and it was most fortunate\r\nthat she now met Lady Wentworth, who became her friend and afterward took\r\nher to England.\r\n\r\nAngelica had already executed commissions for English families of rank\r\nwhom she had met in various cities of Italy, and her friends hoped that\r\nshe would be able to earn more money in England than in Italy, where\r\nthere were numberless artists and copyists. After visiting Paris she went\r\nto London, where a brilliant career awaited her, not only as an artist,\r\nbut in the social world as well.\r\n\r\nDe Rossi thus describes her at this time: \"She was not very tall, but\r\nslight, and her figure was well proportioned. She had a dark, clear\r\ncomplexion, a gracious mouth, white and equal teeth, and well-marked\r\nfeatures;... above all, her azure eyes, so placid and so bright, charmed\r\nyou with an expression it is impossible to write; unless you had known\r\nher you could not understand how eloquent were her looks.\"\r\n\r\nHer English friends belonged to the most cultivated circles, many of them\r\nbeing also of high rank. Artists united to do her honor--showing no\r\nprofessional envy and making no opposition to her election to the\r\nAcademy. Many interesting incidents in her association with London\r\nartists are related, and it is said that both Fuseli and Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds were unsuccessful suitors for her hand. Miss Thackeray, in her\r\nnovel, \"Miss Angel,\" makes Angelica an attractive heroine.\r\n\r\nThe royal family were much interested in her, and the mother of the King\r\nvisited her--an honor never before accorded to an artist--and the\r\nPrincess of Brunswick gave her commissions for several pictures.\r\n\r\nDe Rossi says that her letters at this time were those of a person at the\r\nsummit of joy and tranquillity. She was able to save money and looked\r\nhopefully forward to a time when she could make a home for her unthrifty\r\nfather. But this happy prosperity was suddenly cut short by her own\r\nimprudence.\r\n\r\nAfter refusing many eligible offers of marriage, she was secretly married\r\nto an adventurer who personated the Count de Horn, and succeeded by\r\nplausible falsehoods in convincing her that it was necessary, for good\r\nreasons, to conceal their marriage. One day when painting a portrait of\r\nQueen Charlotte, who was very friendly to the artist, Angelica was moved\r\nto confide the secret of her marriage to the Queen. Until this time no\r\none save her father had known of it.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty, who loved Angelica, expressed her surprise and interest and\r\ndesired that Count de Horn should appear at Court. By this means the\r\ndeceit which had been practised was discovered, and the Queen, as gently\r\nas possible, told Angelica the truth. At first she felt that though her\r\nhusband was not the Count de Horn and had grossly deceived her, he was\r\nthe man she had married and the vows she had made were binding. But it\r\nwas soon discovered that the villain had a living wife when he made his\r\npretended marriage with Angelica, who was thus released from any\r\nconsideration for him. This was a time to prove the sincerity of friends,\r\nand Angelica was comforted by the steadfastness of those who had devoted\r\nthemselves to her in her happier days. Sir Joshua Reynolds was untiring\r\nin his friendly offices for her and for her helpless old father.\r\n\r\nThere were as many differing opinions in regard to Angelica Kauffman, the\r\nwoman, as in regard to the quality of her art. Some of her biographers\r\nbelieved her to be perfectly sincere and uninfluenced by flattery.\r\nNollekens takes another view; he calls her a coquette, and, among other\r\nstories, relates that when in Rome, \"one evening she took her station in\r\none of the most conspicuous boxes in the theatre, accompanied by two\r\nartists, both of whom, as well as many others, were desperately enamoured\r\nof her. She had her place between her two adorers, and while her arms\r\nwere folded before her in front of the box, over which she leaned, she\r\nmanaged to clasp a hand of both, so that each imagined himself the\r\ncavalier of her choice.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Angelica could rise above the unhappiness and mortification of her\r\ninfatuation for the so-called De Horn, she devoted herself to her art,\r\nand during twelve years supported her father and herself and strengthened\r\nthe friendships she had gained in her adopted land. At length, in 1781,\r\nher father's failing health demanded their return to Italy; and now, when\r\nforty years old, she married Antonio Zucchi, an artist who had long loved\r\nher and devoted himself to her and to her father with untiring affection.\r\n\r\nThe old Kauffman lived to visit his home in Schwarzenburg and to reach\r\nSouthern Italy, but died soon after.\r\n\r\nSignor Zucchi made his home in Rome. He was a member of the Royal\r\nAcademy, London, and was in full sympathy with his wife in intellectual\r\nand artistic pursuits and pleasures. De Rossi says: \"It was interesting\r\nto see Angelica and her husband before a picture. While Zucchi spoke with\r\nenthusiasm Angelica remained silent, fixing her eloquent glance on the\r\nfinest portions of the work. In her countenance one could read her\r\nemotions, while her observations were limited to a few brief words.\r\nThese, however, seldom expressed any blame--only the praises of that\r\nwhich was worthy of praise. It belonged to her nature to recognize the\r\nbeauty alone--as the bee draws honey only out of every flower.\"\r\n\r\nHer home in Rome was a centre of attraction to the artistic and literary\r\nsociety of the city, and few persons of note passed any time there\r\nwithout being presented to her. Goethe and Herder were her friends, and\r\nthe former wrote: \"The good Angelica has a most remarkable, and for a\r\nwoman really unheard-of, talent; one must see and value what she does and\r\nnot what she leaves undone. There is much to learn from her, particularly\r\nas to work, for what she effects is really marvellous.\" In his work\r\ncalled \"Winckelmann and His Century,\" Goethe again said of her: \"The\r\nlight and pleasing in form and color, in design and execution,\r\ndistinguish the numerous works of our artist. _No living painter_ excels\r\nher in dignity or in the delicate taste with which she handles the\r\npencil.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the social demands on her time in Rome, she continued to\r\ndevote herself to her art, and Signor Zucchi, hoping to beguile her into\r\nidleness, purchased a charming villa at Castel Gondolfo; but in spite of\r\nits attractions she was never content to be long away from Rome and her\r\nstudio.\r\n\r\nThus in her maturer years her life flowed on in a full stream of\r\nprosperity until, in 1795, Signor Zucchi died. Angelica survived him\r\ntwelve years--years of deep sadness. Not only was her personal sorrow\r\nheavy to bear, but the French invasion of her beloved Italy disquieted\r\nher. Hoping to regain her usual spirits, she revisited the scenes of her\r\nyouth and remained some time in Venice with the family of Signor Zucchi.\r\nReturning to Rome she resumed her accustomed work, so far as her health\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nShe held fast to the German spirit through all the changes in her life,\r\nwith the same determination which made it possible, in her strenuous\r\nlabors, to retain her gentle womanliness. Just before she died she\r\ndesired to hear one of Gellert's spiritual odes.\r\n\r\nShe was buried in Sant' Andrea dei Frati, beside her husband. All the\r\nmembers of the Academy of St. Luke attended her obsequies, and her latest\r\npictures were borne in the funeral procession. Her bust was placed in the\r\nPantheon, and every proper tribute and honor were paid to her memory in\r\nRome, where she was sincerely mourned.\r\n\r\nAlthough Angelica lived and worked so long in London and was one of the\r\nthirty-six original members of the Royal Academy, I do not think her best\r\npictures are in the public galleries there. Of course many of the\r\nportraits painted in London are in private collections. Her pictures are\r\nseen in all the important galleries of Europe. Her etchings, executed\r\nwith grace and spirit, are much esteemed and sell for large prices.\r\nEngravings after her works by Bartolozzi are most attractive; numerous as\r\nthey were, good prints of them are now rare and costly.\r\n\r\nShe painted several portraits of herself; one is in the National Portrait\r\nGallery, London, one at Munich, and a third in the Uffizi, Florence. The\r\nlast is near that of Madame Le Brun, and the contrast between the two is\r\nstriking. Angelica is still young, but the expression of her face is so\r\ngrave as to be almost melancholy; she is sitting on a stone in the midst\r\nof a lonely landscape; she has a portfolio in one hand and a pencil in\r\nthe other, and so unstudied is her pose, and so lacking in any attempt to\r\nlook her best, that one feels that she is entirely absorbed in her work.\r\nThe Frenchwoman could not forget to be interesting; Angelica was\r\ninteresting with no thought of being so.\r\n\r\nI regard three works by this artist, which are in the Dresden Gallery, as\r\nexcellent examples of her work; they are \"A Young Vestal,\" \"A Young\r\nSibyl,\" and \"Ariadne Abandoned by Theseus.\"\r\n\r\nOn the margin of one of her pictures she wrote: \"I will not attempt to\r\nexpress supernatural things by human inspiration, but wait for that till\r\nI reach heaven, if there is painting done there.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1784 Angelica Kauffman painted \"Servius Tullius as a Child\" for the\r\nCzar of Russia; in 1786 \"Hermann and Thusnelda\" and \"The Funeral of\r\nPallas\" for Joseph II. These are now in the Vienna Gallery. Three\r\npictures, \"Virgil Reading the Aeneid to the Empress Octavia,\" \"Augustus\r\nReading Verses on the Death of Marcellus,\" and \"Achilles Discovered by\r\nUlysses, in Female Attire,\" were painted for Catherine II. of Russia.\r\n\"Religion Surrounded by Virtues,\" 1798, is in the National Gallery,\r\nLondon. A \"Madonna\" and a \"Scene from the Songs of Ossian\" are in the\r\nAschaffenburg Gallery. A \"Madonna in Glory\" and the \"Women of Samaria,\"\r\n1799, are in the New Pinakothek, Munich, where is also the portrait of\r\nLouis I. of Bavaria, as Crown Prince, 1805. The \"Farewell of Abelard and\r\nHeloise,\" together with other works of this artist, are in the Hermitage,\r\nSt. Petersburg. A \"Holy Family,\" and others, in the Museo Civico, Venice.\r\n\"Prudence Warning Virtue against Folly,\" in the Pennsylvania Academy,\r\nPhiladelphia. Portraits of Winckelmann in the Städel Institute,\r\nFrankfort, and in the Zürich Gallery.

Anne was born in 1660, and when still quite\r\nyoung was maid of honor to the Duchess of York, whose portrait she\r\npainted as well as that of the future King James II. She also painted\r\nhistorical subjects and still-life.\r\n\r\nOne of her admirers wrote of her as \"A grace for beauty and a muse for\r\nwit.\" A biographer records her death from smallpox when twenty-five years\r\nold, \"to the unspeakable reluctancy of her relatives.\" She was buried in\r\nthe Savoy Chapel, now a \"Royal Peculiar,\" and a mural tablet set forth\r\nher beauty, accomplishments, graces, and piety in a Latin inscription.\r\n\r\nAnne Killigrew was notable for her poetry as well as for her painting.\r\nDryden wrote an ode in her memory which Dr. Johnson called \"the noblest\r\nour language has produced.\" It begins: \"Thou youngest virgin daughter of\r\nthe skies.\" After praising her poetry Dryden wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Her pencil drew whate'er her soul designed,\r\n    And oft the happy draught surpassed the image of her mind.\"\r\n\r\nOf her portrait of James II. he says:\r\n\r\n    \"For, not content to express his outward part,\r\n    Her hand called out the image of his heart;\r\n    His warlike mind--his soul devoid of fear--\r\n    His high designing thoughts were figured there.\"\r\n\r\nHaving repeated these panegyrics, it is but just to add that two opinions\r\nexisted concerning the merit of Mistress Killigrew's art and of Dryden's\r\node, which another critic called \"a harmonious hyperbole, composed of the\r\nFall of Adam--Arethusa--Vestal Virgins--Dian--Cupid--Noah's Ark--the\r\nPleiades--the fall of Jehoshaphat--and the last Assizes.\"\r\n\r\nAnthony Wood, however, says: \"There is nothing spoken of her which she\r\nwas not equal to, if not superior, and if there had not been more true\r\nhistory in her praises than compliment, her father never would have\r\nsuffered them to pass the press.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KINDT, ADELE.</b> This painter of history and of genre subjects won her\r\nfirst prize at Ghent when less than twenty-two, and received medals at\r\nDouai, Cambrai, Ghent, and Brussels before she was thirty-two.

In this school and at that of South Kensington she was\r\nconsidered a failure, by reason of her utterly unacademic manner. She did\r\nnot see things by rule and she persistently represented them as she saw\r\nthem. Her love of nature is intense, and when she illustrated the \"Jungle\r\nBook\" she could more easily imagine that the animals could speak a\r\nlanguage that Mowgli could understand, than an academic artist could\r\nbring himself to fancy for a moment. Her work is full of poetic\r\nimagination, of symbolism, and of the spirit of her subject.\r\n\r\nWalter P. Watson, in a comprehensive critique of her work, says: \"Her\r\nimaginations are more perfect and more minutely organized than what is\r\nseen by the bodily eye, and she does not permit the outward creation to\r\nbe a hindrance to the expression of her artistic creed. The force of\r\nrepresentation plants her imagined figures before her; she treats them as\r\nreal, and talks to them as if they were bodily there; puts words in their\r\nmouths such as they should have spoken, and is affected by them as by\r\npersons. Such creation is poetry in the literal sense of the term, and\r\nMiss King's dreamy and poetical nature enables her to create the persons\r\nof the drama, to invest them with appropriate figures, faces, costumes,\r\nand surroundings; to make them speak after their own characters.\"\r\n\r\nHer important works are in part the illustrations of \"The Little\r\nPrincess,\" \"The Magic Grammar,\" \"La Belle Dame sans Merci,\" \"L'Evangile\r\nde l'Enfance,\" \"The Romance of the Swan's Nest,\" etc.\r\n\r\nShe also makes exquisite designs for book-covers, which have the spirit\r\nof the book for which they are made so clearly indicated that they add to\r\nthe meaning as well as to the beauty of the book.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KIRCHSBERG, ERNESTINE VON.</b> Medal at Chicago Exposition, 1893.

In the beginning of her art studies it was only when her\r\nhome duties were discharged that she could hasten to the Luxembourg,\r\nwhere, curiously enough, her time was devoted to copying \"Le Labourage\r\nNivernais,\" by Rosa Bonheur, whose beloved and devoted friend she later\r\nbecame.\r\n\r\nMeantime Anna Klumpke had visited Boston and other cities of her native\r\nland, and made a success, not only as an artist, but as a woman, whose\r\nintelligence, cheerfulness, and broad interests in life made her a\r\ndelightful companion. Sailing from Antwerp one autumn, I was told by a\r\nfriend that a lady on board had a letter of introduction to me from\r\nMadame Bouguereau. It proved to be Miss Klumpke, and the acquaintance\r\nthus begun, as time went on, disclosed to me a remarkable character,\r\nfounded on a remarkable experience, and it was no surprise to me that the\r\ngreat and good Rosa Bonheur found in Anna Klumpke a sympathetic and\r\nreliable friend and companion for her last days.\r\n\r\nThe history of this friendship and its results are too well known to\r\nrequire more than a passing mention. Miss Klumpke is now established in\r\nParis, and writes me that, in addition to her painting, she is writing of\r\nRosa Bonheur. She says: \"This biography consists of reminiscences of Rosa\r\nBonheur's life, her impressions of Nature, God, and Art, with perhaps a\r\nshort sketch of how I became acquainted with the illustrious woman whose\r\nprecious maternal tenderness will remain forever the most glorious event\r\nof my life.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Salon des Artistes Français, 1903, Miss Klumpke exhibited a\r\npicture called \"Maternal Affection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KNOBLOCH, GERTRUDE.</b> Born at Breslau, 1867.

She inherited from her father a strong inclination for art,\r\nand was placed by him under the instruction of Franz Potter. In the Royal\r\nGallery, Vienna, is her picture called \"Silence,\" 1834. It represents the\r\nVirgin with her finger on her lip to warn against disturbing the sleep of\r\nthe Infant Jesus. The picture is surrounded by a beautiful arrangement of\r\nflowers. In 1836 she painted a charming picture called \"A Bunch of\r\nFlowers.\" Her favorite subjects were floral, and her works of this sort\r\nare much admired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KONEK, IDA.</b> Born at Budapest, 1856. Her early art studies were under\r\nG. Vastagh, C. von Telepy, W. Lindenschmit, and Munkácsy; later she was a\r\npupil at the Julian Academy in Paris and the Scuola libera in Florence.\r\nIn the Parish Church at Köbölkut are three of her pictures of sacred\r\nsubjects, and in the Hungarian National Museum a picture of still-life.\r\nHer \"Old Woman,\" 1885, is mentioned as attracting favorable notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KORA OR CALLIRHOË.</b> It is a well-authenticated fact that in the Greek\r\ncity of Sicyonia, about the middle of the seventh century before Christ,\r\nthere lived the first woman artist of whom we have a reliable account.\r\n\r\nHer story has been often told, and runs in this wise: Kora, or Callirhoë,\r\nwas much admired by the young men of Sicyonia for her grace and beauty,\r\nof which they caught but fleeting glimpses through her veil when they met\r\nher in the flower-market. By reason of Kora's attraction the studio of\r\nher father, Dibutades, was frequented by many young Greeks, who watched\r\nfor a sight of his daughter, while they praised his models in clay.\r\n\r\nAt length one of these youths begged the modeller to receive him as an\r\napprentice, and, his request being granted, he became the daily companion\r\nof both Kora and her father. As the apprentice was skilled in letters, it\r\nsoon came about that he was the teacher and ere long the lover of the\r\ncharming maiden, who was duly betrothed to him.\r\n\r\nThe time for the apprentice to leave his master came all too soon. As he\r\nsat with Kora the evening before his departure, she was seized by an\r\nardent wish for a portrait of her lover, and, with a coal from the\r\nbrazier, she traced upon the wall the outline of the face so dear to her.\r\nThis likeness her father instantly recognized, and, hastening to bring\r\nhis clay, he filled in the sketch and thus produced the first portrait in\r\nbas-relief! It is a charming thought that from the inspiration of a pure\r\naffection so beautiful an art originated, and doubtless Kora's influence\r\ncontributed much to the artistic fame which her husband later achieved in\r\nCorinth.\r\n\r\nIn the latter city the portrait was preserved two hundred years, and\r\nDibutades became so famous for the excellence of his work that at his\r\ndeath several cities claimed the honor of having been his birthplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KRAFFT, ANNA BARBARA.</b> Member of the Vienna Academy. She was born at\r\nIgto in 1764, and died at Bamberg in 1825. She received instruction from\r\nher father, J. N. Steiner, of which she later made good use. Having\r\nmarried an apothecary, she went for a time to Salsburg, and again, after\r\nnine years in Prague, spent eighteen years in Salsburg, retiring finally\r\nto Bamberg. In the Gallery at Bamberg may be seen her portrait of the\r\nfounder, J. Hemmerlein; in the Nostitz Gallery, Prague, a portrait of the\r\nArchduke Charles; in Strahow Abbey, Prague, a \"Madonna\"; and in the\r\nchurch at Owencez, near Prague, an altar-piece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KUNTZE, MARTHA.</b> Born in Heinrichsdorf, Prussia, 1849. Pupil of\r\nSteffeck and Gussow in Berlin. In 1881 she went to Paris and studied\r\nunder Carolus Duran and Henner, and later travelled in Italy, pursuing\r\nher art in Florence, Rome, and Southern Italy. She has an excellent\r\nreputation as a portrait painter, and occasionally paints subjects of\r\nstill-life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KÜSSNER, AMALIA.</b> See Coudert, Amalia Küssner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>LABILLE, ADELAIDE VERTUS.</b> Was born in Paris in 1749. She early\r\ndeveloped a taste for art and a desire to study it. J. E. Vincent was her\r\nmaster in miniature painting, while Latour instructed her in the use of\r\npastels. She was successful as a portrait painter and as a teacher,\r\nhaving some members of the royal family as pupils, who so esteemed her\r\nthat they became her friends. She is known as Madame Vincent, having\r\nmarried the son of her first master in painting.\r\n\r\nHer portrait of the sculptor Gois gained a prize at the Academy, and in\r\n1781 she was made a member of that institution. We know the subjects of\r\nsome large, ambitious works by Madame Vincent, on which she relied for\r\nher future fame, but unhappily they were destroyed in the time of the\r\nFrench Revolution, and she never again had the courage to attempt to\r\nreplace them. One of these represented the \"Reception of a Member to the\r\nOrder of St. Lazare,\" the Grand Master being the brother of the King, who\r\nhad appointed Madame Vincent Painter to the Court. Another of these works\r\nwas a portrait of the artist before her easel, surrounded by her pupils,\r\namong whom was the Duchesse d'Angoulême and other noble ladies.\r\n\r\nAs Madame Vincent and her husband were staunch royalists, they suffered\r\nserious losses during the Revolution; the loss of her pictures was\r\nirreparable. She was so disheartened by the destruction of the result of\r\nthe labors of years that she never again took up her brush with her\r\nold-time ambition and devotion.\r\n\r\nShe died in 1803, at the age of fifty-four, having received many honors\r\nas an artist, while she was beloved by her friends and esteemed by all as\r\na woman of noble character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>LAING, MRS. J. G.</b> Principal studies made in Glasgow under Mr. F. H.\r\nNewbery; also in Paris under Jean-Paul Laurens and Aman-Jean.\r\n\r\nThis artist is especially occupied with portraits of children and their\r\nmothers. She has, however, exhibited works of another sort. Her \"Sweet\r\nRepose\" and \"Masquerading\" were sold from the exhibitions in London and\r\nGlasgow, where they were shown. \"Bruges Lace-Makers\" was exhibited in\r\nMunich in 1903.\r\n\r\nThe Ladies' Club of Glasgow is enterprising and its exhibitions are\r\ninteresting, but Mrs. Laing is not a member of any club, and sends her\r\npictures by invitation to exhibitions on the Continent as well as in\r\nGreat Britain, and sometimes has a private exhibition in Glasgow.\r\n\r\nHer study at Aman-Jean's and Colarossi's gave a certain daintiness and\r\ngrace to her work, which is more Parisian than British in style. There is\r\ngreat freedom in her brush and a delicacy well suited to the painting of\r\nchildren's portraits; her children and their mothers really smile, not\r\ngrin, and are altogether attractive. I cannot say whether the portraits I\r\nhave seen are good likenesses, but they have an air of individuality\r\nwhich favors that idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>LAMB, ELLA CONDIE</b>--Mrs. Charles R. Lamb.

She first exhibited\r\nat the Salon of 1864, a \"Portrait of Madame, the Baroness.\" She has\r\npainted many portraits, and is extremely successful in her pictures of\r\nflowers and fruit.\r\n\r\nAmong her principal works are \"Diana and Her Dog,\" \"Going out of Church,\"\r\n\"Ophelia,\" \"Sleep,\" \"The Fall of the Leaves,\" and \"Manon.\"\r\n\r\nShe has also painted many pictures in water-colors. Since 1890 she has\r\nexhibited at the Champ-de-Mars. Her illustrations in water-colors for\r\n\"L'Abbé Constantin\" and for an edition of \"Flirt\" are very attractive.\r\n\r\nHer \"Roses\" at the Salon of 1903 were especially fine, so fresh and\r\nbrilliant that they seemed to be actual blossoms.\r\n\r\nThis artist, not many months ago, called to mind the celebrated Greek\r\nsupper of Mme. Lebrun, which was so famous in the time of that artist.\r\nThe following is an account of the entertainment given by Mme. Lemaire:\r\n\r\n\"A most fascinating banquet was given in Paris quite recently by\r\nMadeleine Lemaire, in her studio, and Parisians pronounce it the most\r\nartistic fete that has occurred for many a moon. Athens was reconstructed\r\nfor a night. A Greek feast, gathering at the same board the most\r\naristocratic moderns, garbed in the antique peplum, as the caprice of a\r\ngreat artist. The invitation cards, on which the hostess had drawn the\r\ngraceful figure of an Athenian beauty, were worded: 'A Soirée in Athens\r\nin the Time of Pericles. Madeleine Lemaire begs you to honor with your\r\npresence the Greek fête which she will give in her humble abode on\r\nTuesday. Banquet, dances, games, and cavalcade. Ancient Greek costume de\r\nrigueur.' Every one invited responded yes, and from the Duchess d'Uzès,\r\nin a superb robe of cloth of gold and long veil surmounted by a circlet\r\nof diamonds, to that classic beauty Mme. Barrachin, in white draperies\r\nwith a crown of pink laurel, the costumes were beautiful. One graceful\r\nwoman went as Tanagra. The men were some of them splendid in the garb of\r\nold Greek warriors, wearing cuirass and helmet of gold. At dessert a bevy\r\nof pretty girls in classic costume distributed flowers and fruits to the\r\nguests, while Greek choruses sung by female choristers alternated with\r\nverses admirably recited by Bartel and Reichenberg. After the banquet\r\nEmma Calvé and Mme. Litoinne sang passages from 'Philémon et Bacus,' and\r\nthen there were Greek dances executed by the leading dancers of the\r\nOpera. After supper and much gayety, the evening came to a close by an\r\nanimated farandole danced by all present. It takes an artist like\r\nMadeleine Lemaire to design and execute such a fete, and beside it how\r\ncommonplace appear the costly functions given by society in Newport and\r\nNew York.\"\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>LEVICK, RUBY WINIFRED.</b> At the South Kensington Royal College of Art\r\nthis artist gained the prize for figure design; the medal for a study of\r\na head from life, besides medals and other awards in the National\r\nCompetition; British Institution scholarship for modelling, 1896; gold\r\nmedal and the Princess of Wales scholarship, 1897; gold medal in national\r\ncompetition, 1898.

She exhibited at\r\nthe Academy, 1903, \"Sledgehammers: Portion of a Frieze in Relief.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>LEWIS, EDMONIA.</b> Born in the State of New York. This artist descended\r\nfrom both Indian and African ancestors. She had comparatively no\r\ninstruction, when, in 1865, she exhibited in Boston a portrait bust of\r\nColonel Shaw, which at once attracted much attention. In 1867 she\r\nexhibited a statue called the \"Freedwoman.\" Soon after this she took up\r\nher residence in Rome and very few of her works were seen in the United\r\nStates. She sent to the Philadelphia exhibition, in 1876, the \"Death of\r\nCleopatra,\" in marble. The Marquis of Bute bought her \"Madonna with the\r\nInfant Christ,\" an altar-piece. Her \"Marriage of Hiawatha\" was purchased\r\nby a New York lady.\r\n\r\nAmong her other works are \"An Old Arrow-Maker and His Daughter,\"\r\n\"Asleep,\" and terra-cotta busts of Charles Sumner, Longfellow, John\r\nBrown, and others.\r\n\r\n\"Among Miss Lewis's works are two small groups illustrating Longfellow's\r\npoem of Hiawatha. Her first, 'Hiawatha's Wooing,' represents Minnehaha\r\nseated, making a pair of moccasins, and Hiawatha by her side with a world\r\nof love and longing in his eyes. In the 'Marriage' they stand side by\r\nside with clasped hands. In both the Indian type of feature is carefully\r\npreserved, and every detail of dress, etc., is true to nature. The\r\nsentiment equals the execution. They are charming bits, poetic, simple,\r\nand natural, and no happier illustrations of Longfellow's most original\r\npoem were ever made than these by the Indian sculptor.\"--_Revolution_,\r\nApril, 1871.\r\n\r\n\"This was not a beautiful work--'Cleopatra'--but it was very original and\r\nvery striking, and it merits particular comment, as its ideal was so\r\nradically different from those adopted by Story and Gould in their\r\nstatues of the Egyptian Queen.... The effects of death are represented\r\nwith such skill as to be absolutely repellent. Apart from all questions\r\nof taste, however, the striking qualities of the work are undeniable, and\r\nit could only have been produced by a sculptor of very genuine\r\nendowments.\"--_Great American Sculptors._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>LEY, SOPHIE.</b> Third-class medal at Melbourne; honor diplomas,\r\nKarlsruhe.

The Gallery at Vicenza has several\r\nof her views of Venice and Rome, and there are others in the municipal\r\npalace at Naples. Her pictures have usually sold immediately upon their\r\nexhibition, and are scattered through many European cities.

Two of the\r\nSignora's later pictures are \"Arum Italicum,\" exhibited at Milan in 1881,\r\nand a \"Park at Capodimonte,\" shown at the International Exposition in\r\nRome--the latter is a brilliant piece of work.

Her\r\nmost generally liked picture is her 'Madonna.' All the figures wear a\r\nsweet, solemn sadness, illumined by immortal faith and love.\"--_Art\r\nInterchange,_ April, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MAGLIANI, FRANCESCA.</b> Born at Palermo in 1845, and studied painting\r\nthere under a private teacher. Going later to Florence she was a pupil of\r\nBedussi and of Gordigiani. Her early work consisted of copies from the\r\nItalian and other masters, and these were so well done that she soon\r\nbegan to receive orders, especially for portraits, from well-known\r\npeople. Among them were G. Baccelli--the Minister of Public\r\nInstruction--King Humbert, and Queen Margherita, the latter arousing much\r\ninterest when exhibited in Florence. Portraits of her mother, and of her\r\nhusband, who was the Minister of Finance, were also recognized as\r\nadmirable examples of portraiture. \"Modesty and Vanity\" is one of her\r\ngenre pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MANGILLA, ADA.</b> Gold medal at Ferrara for a \"Bacchante,\" which is now\r\nin the Gallery there; gold medal at Beatrice, in Florence, 1890, for the\r\n\"Three Marys.\" Born in Florence in 1863. Pupil of Cassioli. One of her\r\nearly works was a design for two mosaic figures in the left door of the\r\nCathedral in Florence, representing Bonifazio Lupi and Piero di Luca\r\nBorsi; this was exhibited in 1879, and was received with favor by the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThis artist has had much success with Pompeian subjects, such as \"A\r\nPompeian Lady at Her Toilet,\" and \"A Pompeian Flower-Seller.\" She catches\r\nwith great accuracy the characteristics of the Pompeian type; and this\r\nfacility, added to the brilliancy of her color and the spirit and\r\nsympathy of her treatment, has given these pictures a vogue. Two of them\r\nwere sold in Holland. \"Floralia\" was sold in Venice. To an exhibition of\r\nItalian artists in London, in 1889, she contributed \"The Young Agrippa,\"\r\nwhich was sold to Thomas Walker. Her grace and fancy appear in the\r\ndrawings which she finds time to make for \"Florentia,\" and in such\r\npictures as \"The Rose Harvest.\"\r\n\r\nThis highly accomplished woman, who has musical and literary talent, is\r\nthe wife of Count Francessetti di Mersenile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MANKIEWICZ, HENRIETTE.</b> Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. A series of\r\nher mural decorations was exhibited in various German cities, and finally\r\nshown at the Paris Exposition of 1890(?), where they excited such\r\napplause that the above honor was accorded her. These decorations are in\r\nthe form of panels, in which water, in its varying natural aspects,\r\nsupplies the subordinate features, while the fundamental motive is\r\nvegetation of every description. The artist has evidently felt the\r\ninfluence of Markart in Vienna, and some of her conceptions remind one\r\nof H. von Preusschen. Her technique is a combination of embroidery,\r\npainting, and applications on silk. Whether this combination of methods\r\nis desirable is another question, but as a means of decoration it is\r\nhighly effective.\r\n\r\nAt an exhibition of paintings by women of Saxony, held in Dresden under\r\nthe patronage of Queen Carola in the fall of 1892, this artist exhibited\r\nanother decorative panel, done in the same manner, which seems to have\r\nbeen a great disappointment to those who had heard wonderful accounts of\r\nthe earlier cycle of panels. It was too full of large-leaved flowers, and\r\nthe latter were too brilliant to serve as a foreground to the Alhambra\r\nscenes, which were used as the chief motive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MANLY, ALICE ELFRIDA.</b> A national gold medal and the Queen's gold\r\nmedal, at the Royal Female School of Art, London. Member of the Dudley\r\nGallery Art Society and the Hampstead Art Society. Born in London. Pupil\r\nof the above-mentioned School and of the Royal Academy Schools.\r\n\r\nThis artist has exhibited at the Academy, at the Royal Institute of\r\nPainters in Water Colors, and other exhibitions. Her pictures have\r\nfrequently been sold from the exhibitions and reproduced. Among these are\r\n\"Sympathy,\" sold as first prize in Derby Art Union; \"Diverse\r\nAttractions\"; \"Interesting Discoveries\"; \"Coming,\" sold from the Royal\r\nAcademy; \"Gossips\"; \"The Wedding Gown,\" etc.\r\n\r\nMiss Manly has done much work for publishers, which has been reproduced\r\nin colors and in black and white. She usually combines figures and\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MANTOVANI, SIGNORA S. ROME.</b>\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MARAINI, ADELAIDE.</b> Gold medal in Florence, at Beatrice Exposition,\r\n1903. Born in 1843. This sculptor resides in Rome, where her works have\r\nbeen made. An early example of her art, \"Camilla,\" while it gave proof of\r\nher artistic temperament, was unimportant; but her later works, as they\r\nhave followed each other, have constantly gained in excellence, and have\r\nwon her an enviable reputation. Among her statues are \"Amleto,\" \"The\r\nSulamite Woman,\" and \"Sappho.\" The last was enthusiastically received in\r\nParis in 1878, and is the work which gained the prize at Florence, where\r\nit was said to be the gem of the exhibition. She has also executed a\r\nmonument to Attilio Lemmi, which represents \"Youth Weeping over the Tomb\r\nof the Dead,\" and is in the Protestant Cemetery at Florence; a\r\nbas-relief, the \"Angels of Prayer and of the Resurrection\"; a group,\r\n\"Romeo and Juliet\"; and portraits of Carlo Cattanei, Giuseppe Civinini,\r\nSignora Allievi, Senator Musio, the traveller De Albertis, and Victor\r\nEmmanuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MARCELLE, ADÈLE,</b> Duchess of Castiglione-Colonna, family name\r\nd'Affry. Born at Fribourg, Switzerland, 1837, and died at Castellamare,\r\n1879. Her early manner was that of the later Cinquecento, but she\r\nafterward adopted a rather bombastic and theatrical style. Her only\r\nstatue, a Pythia, in bronze was placed in the Grand Opera at Paris\r\n(1870). In the Luxembourg Museum are marble busts of Bianca Capello\r\n(1863) and an \"Abyssinian Sheikh\" (1870). A \"Gorgon\" (1865), a \"Saviour\"\r\n(1875), \"La Bella Romana\" (1875) are among her other works. She left her\r\nart treasures, valued at about fifty thousand francs, to the Cantonal\r\nMuseum at Fribourg, where they occupy a separate room, called the\r\nMarcello Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MARCOVIGI, CLEMENTINA.</b> Born in Bologna, where she resides. Flower\r\npieces exhibited by her at Turin in 1884 and at Venice in 1887 were\r\ncommended for perfection of design and charm of color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MARIA FEODOROVNA,</b> wife of the Czar Peter I. As Princess Dorothea\r\nAuguste Sophie of Würtemberg she was born at Trepton in 1759, and died at\r\nPetersburg in 1858. She studied under Leberecht, and engraved medals and\r\ncameos, many of which are portraits of members of the royal family and\r\nare in the royal collection at Petersburg. She was elected to the Berlin\r\nAcademy in 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MARIANI, VIRGINIA.</b> Honorary member of the Umbrian Academy and of the\r\nAcademy of the Virtuosi of the Pantheon. Born in Rome, 1824, where she\r\nhas met with much success in decorating pottery, as well as in oil and\r\nwater-color paintings. The Provincial Exposition at Perugia in 1875\r\ndisplayed her \"Mezze Figure,\" which was highly commended. She has\r\ndecorated cornices, with flowers in relief, as well as some vases that\r\nare very beautiful. Besides teaching in several institutions and\r\nreceiving private pupils, she has been an inspector, in her own\r\ndepartment of art, of the municipal schools of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MARIE, DUCHESS OF WÜRTEMBERG.</b> Daughter of Louis Philippe, and wife\r\nof Duke Frederick William Alexander of Würtemberg. Born at Palermo, 1813,\r\nand died at Pisa, 1839. She studied drawing with Ary Scheffer. Her statue\r\nof \"Jeanne d'Arc\" is at Versailles; in the Ferdinand Chapel, in the Bois\r\nde Boulogne, is the \"Peri as a Praying Angel\"; in the Saturnin Chapel at\r\nFontainebleau is a stained-glass window with her design of \"St. Amalia.\"\r\nAmong her other works are \"The Dying Bayard,\" a relief representing the\r\nlegend of the Wandering Jew, and a bust of the Belgian Queen. Many of her\r\ndrawings are in possession of her family. She also executed some\r\nlithographs, such as \"Souvenirs of 1812,\" 1831, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MARIE LOUISE, EMPRESS OF FRANCE.</b> 1791-1846. She studied under\r\nPrud'hon. Her \"Girl with a Dove\" is in the Museum of Besançon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MARLEF, CLAUDE.</b> Bronze medal at Paris Exposition, 1900. Associate of\r\nthe French National Society of Fine Arts (Beaux-Arts). Born at Nantes.\r\nPupil of A. Roll, Benjamin Constant, Puvis de Chavannes, and Dagnaux.\r\n\r\nMme. Marlef is a portrait painter. Her picture, \"Manette Salomon,\" is in\r\nthe Hotel de Ville, Paris; the \"Nymphe Accroupie\" is in the Municipal\r\nMuseum of Nantes. Among her portraits of well-known women are those of\r\nJane Hading, Elsie de Wolfe, Bessie Abbott of the Opera, Rachel Boyer of\r\nthe Theatre Français, Marguerite Durand, Editeur de la Fronde, Mlle.\r\nRichepin, and many others.\r\n\r\nMme. Marlef has the power of keen observation, so necessary to a painter\r\nof portraits. Although there is a certain element of soft tenderness in\r\nher pictures, the bold virility of her drawing misled the critics, who\r\nfor a time believed that her name was used to conceal the personality of\r\na man. A critic in the Paris _World_ writes of this artist: \"She has\r\nexquisite color sense and delights in presenting that _exaltation de la\r\nvie_, that love, radiance, and joy of life, which are at once the secret\r\nof the success and the keynote of the masterful canvases of Roll, in\r\nwhose studio were first developed Claude Marlef's delicate qualities of\r\ntruthful perception in the portraiture of woman.... Her perceptions being\r\nrapid, she has a remarkable instantaneous insight, enabling her to fix\r\nthe dominant feature and soul of expression in each of the various types\r\namong her numerous sitters.\"\r\n\r\nMme. Marlef's family name is Lefebure. Her husband died in 1891, the year\r\nafter their marriage, and she then devoted herself to the serious study\r\nof painting, which she had practised from childhood. She first exhibited\r\nat the Salon, 1895, and has exhibited annually since then. In 1902 she\r\nsent her own portrait, and in 1903 that of Bessie Abbott, to the\r\nExhibition of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MARTIN DE CAMPO, VICTORIA.</b> Member of the Academy of Fine Arts of\r\nCadiz, her native city. In the different expositions of this and other\r\nAndalusian capitals she has exhibited since 1840 many works, including\r\nportraits, genre, historical pictures, and copies. Among them may be\r\nmentioned \"Susanna in the Bath,\" \"David Playing the Harp before Saul,\" a\r\n\"Magdalen,\" a \"Cupid,\" a \"Boy with a Linnet,\" and a \"Nativity.\" Some of\r\nthese were awarded prizes. In the Chapel of Relics in the new Cathedral\r\nat Cadiz are her \"Martyrdom of St. Lawrence\" and a \"Mater Dolorosa.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MARTINEAU, EDITH.</b> Associate of Royal Society of Painters in\r\nWater-Colors; member of the Hampstead Art Society. Born in Liverpool,\r\nwhere she made her first studies in the School of Art, and later became a\r\npupil of the Royal Academy Schools, London.\r\n\r\nHer pictures are not large and are principally figures or figures in\r\nlandscape, and all in water-colors. She writes very modestly that so many\r\nare sold and in private hands that she will give no list of subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MASSARI, LUIGIA.</b> Medal at Piacenza, 1869, and several other medals\r\nfrom art societies. Born at Piacenza, 1810. Pupil of A. Gemmi. Her works\r\nare in a number of churches: \"St. Martin\" in the church at Altoé; \"St.\r\nPhilomena\" in the church at Busseto; the \"Madonna del Carmine\" and \"St.\r\nAnna\" in the church at Monticelli d'Ongina. This artist was also famous\r\nfor her beautiful embroidery, as seen in her altar-cloths, one of which\r\nis in the Guastafredda Chapel at Piacenza. The fruits and flowers\r\nproduced by her needle are marvellously like those in her pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MASSEY, MRS. GERTRUDE.</b> Member of the Society of Miniaturists. Born\r\nin London, 1868. Has studied with private teachers in London and Paris.\r\n\r\nThis painter has made a specialty of miniatures and of pictures of dogs.\r\nShe has been extensively employed by various members of the royal family,\r\nof whom she painted eleven miniatures, among which was one of the late\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nShe sends me a list of several pictures of dogs and \"Pets,\" all belonging\r\nto titled English ladies; also a long list of miniatures of gentlemen,\r\nladies, and children of high degree, several being of the royal family,\r\nin addition, I suppose, to the eleven mentioned above.\r\n\r\nShe writes me: \"Constantly met King and Queen and other members. Sittings\r\ntook place at Windsor Castle, Sandringham, Marlborough House, Osborne,\r\nand Balmoral. One dog died after first sitting; had to finish from dead\r\ndog. Live in charming little cottage with _genuine_ old-fashioned garden\r\nin St. John's Wood.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Massey has exhibited at the Royal Academy and New Gallery, and has\r\nheld a special exhibition of her pictures of dogs at the Fine Art\r\nSociety, New Bond Street, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MASSIP, MARGUERITE.</b> Member of the Society of Swiss Painters and\r\nSculptors and of the Society of Arts and Letters, Geneva. Born at Geneva.\r\nMade her studies in Florence and Paris under the professors in the public\r\nschools. Her picture of \"Le Buveur\" is in the Museum of Geneva; \"Five\r\no'Clock Tea,\" also in a Geneva Museum; \"La Bohemienne\" is at Nice; \"The\r\nEngagement\"--a dancer--at St. Gall, and a large number of portraits in\r\nvarious cities, belonging to their subjects and their families.\r\n\r\nHer portrait of Mme. M. L. was very much praised when exhibited in\r\nproximity with the works of some of the famous French artists. One critic\r\nwrites: \"The painting is firm and brilliant. The hands are especially\r\nbeautiful; we scarcely know to whom we can compare Mme. Massip, unless\r\nto M. Paul Dubois. They have the same love of art, the same soberness of\r\ntone, the same scorn of artifice.... The woman who has signed such a\r\nportrait is a great artist.\" It is well known that the famous sculptor is\r\na remarkable portraitist.\r\n\r\nIn a review of the Salon at Nice we read: \"A portrait by Mme. Massip is a\r\nmagnificent canvas, without a single stroke of the charlatan. The pose is\r\nsimple and dignified; there is the serenity and repose of a woman no\r\nlonger young, who makes no pretension to preserve her vanishing beauty;\r\nthe costume, in black, is so managed that it would not appear\r\nsuperannuated nor ridiculous at any period. The execution is that of a\r\ngreat talent and an artistic conscience. It is not a portrait for a\r\nbedchamber, still less for a studio; it is a noble souvenir for a family,\r\nand should have a place in the salon, in which, around the hearth, three\r\ngenerations may gather, and in this serene picture may see the wife, the\r\nmother, and the grandmother, when they mourn the loss of her absolute\r\npresence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MASSOLIEN, ANNA.</b> Born at Görlitz, 1848. A pupil of G. Gräf and of\r\nthe School of Women Artists in Berlin. Her portraits of Field Marshal von\r\nSteinmetz, Brückner, and G.

Daughter of King\r\nJerome Bonaparte. Born at Trieste, 1820; died at Paris, 1904. Pupil of\r\nEugene Giraud. She painted genre subjects in water-colors. Her medal\r\npicture, \"Head of a Young Girl,\" is in the Luxembourg; \"A Jewess of\r\nAlgiers,\" 1866, is in the Museum of Lille; \"The Intrigue under the\r\nPortico of the Doge's Palace\" was painted in 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MATHILDE CAROLINE,</b> Grand Duchess of Hesse.

At\r\nthe Salon of 1900 her picture, \"Mother and Child,\" was hung on the line.\r\n\r\nMiss Maury has made an especial study of child life. Among her pictures\r\nare \"Little Sister,\" \"Choir Boy,\" \"Late Breakfast,\" and \"First Steps.\"\r\nThe latter picture and the \"Baby in a Go-Cart\" have been published in the\r\nCopley Prints.\r\n\r\n\"Cornelia F. Maury is most successful in portrayals of childhood. Her\r\nsmall figures are simple, unaffected, with no suggestion of pose. They\r\nconvey that delightful feeling of unconsciousness in the subject that is\r\nalways so charming either in nature or in artistic expression. The pastel\r\ndepicting the flaxen-haired child in blue dress drawing a tiny cart is\r\nexceedingly artistic, and the same may be said of a pastel showing a\r\nsmall child in a Dutch high-chair near a window. A third picture--also a\r\npastel--represents a choir-boy in a red robe, red cap, and white\r\nsurplice, sitting in a high-backed, carved chair, holding a book in his\r\nhand. Miss Maury really has produced nothing finer than this last. It is\r\na most excellent work.\"--_The Mirror, St. Louis,_ April 10, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MAYREDER-OBERMAYER, ROSE.</b> Born in Vienna, 1858. Pupil of Darnaut and\r\nCharmont. The works of this successful painter of flowers and still-life\r\nhave been exhibited in Berlin, Vienna, Dresden, and Chicago. She has a\r\nbroad, sure touch quite unusual in water-colors. She has also executed\r\nsome notable decorative works, one of which, \"November,\" has attracted\r\nmuch attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MCCROSSAN, MARY.</b> Silver and bronze medals, Liverpool; silver medal\r\nand honorable mention, Paris.

Delécluse; St. Ives, Cornwall, under\r\nJulius Ollson.\r\n\r\nThe principal works of this artist are marine subjects and landscapes,\r\nand are mostly in private collections.\r\n\r\nIn the _Studio,_ November, 1900, we read: \"Miss McCrossan's exhibition of\r\npictures and sketches displayed a pleasant variety of really clever work,\r\nmostly in oils, with a few water-colors and pastels. In each medium her\r\ncolor is strong, rich, and luminous, and her drawing vigorous and\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n\"While this artist's landscape subjects are intelligently selected and\r\nattractively rendered, there is unusual merit in her marine pictures,\r\ncomposed mainly from the fisher-craft of the Isle of Man and the\r\nneighborhood of St. Ives, and recording effects of brilliant sunshine\r\nlighting up white herring boats lying idly on intensely reflective blue\r\nsea, or aground on the harbor mud at low tide. There is a fascination in\r\nthe choice color treatment of these characteristic pictures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MCLAUGHLIN, MARY LOUISE M.</b> Honorable mention, Paris Salon, 1878;\r\nsilver medal, Paris Exposition, 1889; gold medal, Atlanta, 1895; bronze\r\nmedal, Buffalo, 1900.

Having\r\npractised under- and over-glaze work on pottery, as well as porcelain\r\netching and decorative etching on metals, she is now devoting herself to\r\nmaking the porcelain known as Losanti Ware.\r\n\r\nOf a recent exhibition, 1903, a critic wrote: \"Perhaps the most beautiful\r\nand distinguished group in the exhibition is that of Miss McLaughlin, one\r\nof the earliest artistic workers in clay of the United States. She sends\r\na collection of lovely porcelain vases, of a soft white tone and charming\r\nin contour. Some of these have open-work borders, others are decorated in\r\nrelief, and the designs are tinted with delicate jade greens, dark blues,\r\nor salmon pinks. This ware goes by the name of Losanti, from the early\r\nname of Cincinnati, L'Osantiville.\"\r\n\r\nThis artist has written several books on china painting and pottery\r\ndecoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MCMANUS MANSFIELD, BLANCHE.</b> Diplomas from the New Orleans Centennial\r\nand the Woman's Department, Chicago, 1903. Member of the New Vagabonds,\r\nLondon, and the Touring Club of France. Born in East Feliciana Parish,\r\nLouisiana, this artist has made her studies in London and Paris. Her\r\nprincipal work has been done in book illustrations. The following list\r\ngives some of her most important publications:\r\n\r\n    \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking-Glass.\" De\r\n        Luxe edition in color.

Sold in London for 1904.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking of several works by Miss McManus, a notice from London\r\nsays: \"A more difficult or at least a more intricate series were the\r\ndesigns cut on wood for 'The Altar Service Book,' just issued in London\r\nby that newly founded venture, the De La More Press; which has drawn unto\r\nitself such scholars as Dr. Furnival, Professor Skeat, and Israel\r\nGollancz. These designs by Miss McManus were printed direct from the wood\r\nblocks in very limited editions, on genuine vellum, on Japanese vellum,\r\nand a small issue on a real sixteenth-century hand-made paper. The\r\nvarious editions were immediately taken up in London on publication;\r\nhence it is unlikely that copies will be generally seen in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DELFT\r\n\r\nBLANCHE McMANUS MANSFIELD]\r\n\r\n\"We learn, however, that the original wood blocks will be shown at the\r\nSt. Louis Exposition, in the section to be devoted to the work of\r\nAmerican artists resident abroad. We suggest that all lovers of\r\nlatter-day bookmaking 'make a note of it,' recalling meanwhile that it\r\nwas this successful American designer who produced also the decorative\r\nwood-cut borders and initials which were used in 'The Coronation\r\nPrayer-Book of King Edward VII.,' issued from the celebrated Oxford\r\nUniversity Press. There were forty initials or headings, embodying the\r\ncoronation regalia, including the crown, sceptre, rose, thistle,\r\nshamrock, etc. The magnificent cover for the book was also designed by\r\nthis artist.\r\n\r\n\"Among the American artists who have made a distinctive place in art\r\ncircles, not only in America but on 'the other side,' is Mrs. M. F.\r\nMansfield, formerly Blanche McManus of Woodville, Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\"In London she is widely known as a skilful, able, and versatile artist,\r\nand her remarkable success there is an illustration of 'the American\r\ninvasion.' Little has been written in America, especially in the South,\r\nof what this talented Southern woman has accomplished. She has never\r\nsought personal advertisement; on the contrary, she has shrunk from any\r\nkind of publicity--even that which would have accrued from a proper\r\nvaluation of her work.\r\n\r\n\"She is one of those artists whose talent is equalled only by her\r\nmodesty, who, enamoured of her art and aiming at a patient, painstaking\r\nrealization of her ideal, has been content to work on in silence. In the\r\nestimation of art connoisseurs, Blanche McManus is an artist of\r\nunquestionable talent and varied composition, who has already done much\r\nstriking work. Her execution in the various branches has attracted\r\ninternational attention.\r\n\r\n\"She paints well in water-colors and in oil, and her etching is\r\nconsidered excellent. Her drawing is stamped good, and every year she has\r\nshowed rapid improvement in design. She is a highly cultivated woman,\r\nwith a close and accurate observation. A sincere appreciation of nature\r\nwas revealed in her earliest efforts, and for some years she devoted much\r\ntime to its study.\"\r\n\r\nMoring's _Quarterly_ says in regard to the special work which Mrs.\r\nMansfield has done: \"It is so seldom that an artist is able to take in\r\nhand what may be termed the entire decoration of a book--including in\r\nthat phrase cover, illustration, colophon, head- and tail-pieces, initial\r\nletters, and borders--that it is a pleasure to find in the subject of our\r\npaper a lady who may be said to be capable of taking all these points\r\ninto consideration in the embellishment of a volume.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MEDICI, MARIE DE'.</b> Wife of Henry IV. Born at Florence, 1573; died at\r\nCologne, 1642. A portrait of herself, engraved on wood, bears the legend,\r\n\"Maria Medici F. MDLXXXII.\" Another portrait of a girl, attributed to\r\nher, is signed, \"L. O. 1617.\" It may be considered a matter of grave\r\ndoubt whether the nine-year-old girl drew and engraved with her own hand\r\nthe first-named charming picture, which has been credited to her with\r\nsuch frank insouciance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MENGS, ANNA MARIA.</b> Member of the Academy of San Fernando. She was a\r\ndaughter of Anton Rafael Mengs, and was born in Dresden in 1751, where\r\nshe received instruction from her father. In 1777 she married the\r\nengraver Salvador Carmona in Rome, and went with him to Spain, where she\r\ndied in 1790. Portraits and miniatures of excellent quality were\r\nexecuted by her, and on them her reputation rests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MERIAN, MARIA SIBYLLA.</b> Born at Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1647. This\r\nartist merits our attention, although her art was devoted to an unusual\r\npurpose. Her father was a learned geographer and engraver whose published\r\nworks are voluminous. Her maternal grandfather was the eminent engraver,\r\nTheodore de Bry or Brie.\r\n\r\nFrom her childhood Anna Sibylla Merian displayed an aptitude for drawing\r\nand a special interest in insect life. The latter greatly disturbed her\r\nmother, but she could not turn the child's attention from entomology, and\r\nwas forced to allow that study to become her chief pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe flower painter, Abraham Mignon, was her master in drawing and\r\npainting; but at an early age, before her studies were well advanced, she\r\nmarried an architect, John Andrew Graf, of Nuremberg, with whom she lived\r\nunhappily. She passed nearly twenty years in great seclusion, and, as she\r\ntells us in the preface to one of her books, she devoted these years to\r\nthe examination and study of various insects, watching their\r\ntransformations and making drawings from them. Many of these were in\r\ncolors on parchment and were readily sold to connoisseurs.\r\n\r\nHer first published work was called \"The Wonderful Transformations of\r\nCaterpillars.\" It appeared in 1679, was fully illustrated by copper plate\r\nengravings, executed by herself from her own designs. About 1684 she\r\nseparated from her husband, and with her daughters returned to Frankfort.\r\nMany interesting stories are told of her life there.\r\n\r\nShe made a journey to Friesland and was a convert to the doctrines of\r\nLabadie, but she was still devoted to her study and research. She was\r\nassociated with the notable men of her time, and became the friend of the\r\nfather of Rachel Ruysch. Although Madame Merian, who had taken her maiden\r\nname, was seventeen years older than the gifted flower painter, she\r\nbecame to her an example of industry and devotion to study.\r\n\r\nMadame Merian had long desired to examine the insects of Surinam, and in\r\n1699, by the aid of the Dutch Government, she made the journey--of which\r\na French poet wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Sibylla à Surinam va chercher la nature,\r\n    Avec l'esprit d'un Sage, et le coeur d'un Heros\"\r\n\r\n--which indicates the view then held of a journey which would now attract\r\nno attention.\r\n\r\nWhile in Guiana some natives brought her a box filled with \"lantern\r\nflies,\" as they were then called. The noise they made at night was so\r\ndisturbing that she liberated them, and the flies, regaining liberty,\r\nflashed out their most brilliant light, for which Madame Merian was\r\nunprepared, and in her surprise dropped the box. From this circumstance a\r\nmost exaggerated idea obtained concerning the illuminating power of the\r\nflies.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Surinam was so unhealthy for Madame Merian that she could\r\nremain there but two years, and in that time she gathered the materials\r\nfor her great work called \"Metamorphoses Insectorum Surinamensium,\" etc.\r\nThe illustrations were her own, and she pictured many most interesting\r\nobjects--animals and vegetables as well as insects--which were quite\r\nunknown in Europe. Several editions of this book were published both in\r\nGerman and French. Her plates are still approved and testify to the scope\r\nand thoroughness of her research, as well as to her powers as an artist.\r\n\r\nHer chief work, however, was a \"History of the Insects of Europe, Drawn\r\nfrom Nature, and Explained by Maria Sibylla Merian.\" The illustrations of\r\nthis work were beautiful and of great interest, as the insects, from\r\ntheir first state to their last, were represented with the plants and\r\nflowers which they loved, each object being correctly and tastefully\r\npictured. Most of the original paintings for these works are in the\r\nBritish Museum. In the Vienna Gallery is a \"Basket of Flowers\" by this\r\nartist, and in the Basle Museum a picture of \"Locust and Chafers.\"\r\n\r\nThe daughters of this learned artist naturalist, Joanna Maria Helena and\r\nDorothea, shared the pursuits and labors of their mother, and it was her\r\nintention to publish their drawings as an appendix to her works. She did\r\nnot live to do this, and later the daughters published a separate volume\r\nof their own.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary woman, whose studies and writings added so much to the\r\nknowledge of her time, was neither beautiful nor graceful. Her portraits\r\npresent a woman with hard and heavy features, her hair in short curls\r\nsurmounted by a stiff and curious headdress, made of folds of some black\r\nstuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MERRITT, MRS. ANNA LEA.</b> Honorable mention, Paris Exposition, 1889;\r\ntwo medals and a diploma, Chicago Exposition, 1893. In 1890 her picture\r\nof \"Love Locked Out\" was purchased by the Chantry fund, London, for two\r\nhundred and fifty pounds. This honor has been accorded to few women, and\r\nof these I think Mrs. Merritt was first. Member of the Royal Society of\r\nPainter-Etchers. Born in Philadelphia. Pupil of Heinrich Hoffman in\r\nDresden, and of Henry Merritt--whom she married--in London.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merritt has a home in Hampshire, England, but is frequently in\r\nPhiladelphia, where she exhibits her pictures, which have also been seen\r\nat the Royal Academy since 1871.\r\n\r\nThis artist is represented by her pictures in the National Gallery of\r\nBritish Art, in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and by her\r\nportrait of Mr. James Russell Lowell in Memorial Hall, Harvard\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MICHIS, MARIA.</b> See Cattaneo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MILBACHER, LOUISE VON.</b> Prize at Berlin in 1886.

Her pictures have been sold in\r\nParis, London, and Ireland, as well as in Rome and other Italian cities,\r\nwhere many of them are in the collections of distinguished families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MOLDURA, LILLA.</b> A Neapolitan painter. Her father was an Italian and\r\nher mother a Spaniard. She was instructed in the elements of art by\r\nvarious excellent teachers, and then studied oil painting under\r\nMaldarelli and water-color under Mancini. She has often exhibited\r\npictures in Naples, to the satisfaction of both artists and critics, and\r\nhas also won success in London. She has been almost equally happy in\r\nviews of the picturesque Campagna, and in interiors, both in oil and\r\nwater-colors. The interior of the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception, in\r\nthe Church of the Gerolamini, is strong in execution and good in drawing\r\nand color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MÖLLER, AGNES SLOTT.</b> Born in 1862.

She has sent her pictures to the\r\nAcademy and the Grosvenor Gallery exhibitions since 1879. \"Blessing a\r\nTomb, Westminster,\" was at the Philadelphia Exposition, 1876; \"Corner of\r\nSt. Mark's\" and \"Fishing Boats, Venice,\" were at Paris, 1878.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 she exhibited at the Society of British Artists, \"Il Giardino\r\nPublico\"--the Public Garden--of which a writer in the _Art Journal_ said:\r\n\"'Il Giardino Publico' stands foremost among the few redeeming features\r\nof the exhibition. In delicate perception of natural beauty the picture\r\nsuggests the example of Corot. Like the great Frenchman, Miss Montalba\r\nstrives to interpret the sadder moods of nature, when the wind moves the\r\nwater a little mournfully and the outlines of the objects become\r\nuncertain in the filmy air.\"\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MORETTO, EMMA.</b> Venetian painter, exhibited at Naples, in 1877,\r\n\"Abbey of St. Gregory at Venice\"; at Turin, in 1880, a fine view of the\r\n\"Canal of the Giudecca,\" and \"Canal of S.

Her attention was divided between\r\nenamel painting and pastel, much of the latter being miniature work. In\r\nthe Dresden Gallery are two of her pastel portraits and two copies in\r\nminiature of Correggio, viz., a half-length portrait of herself and a\r\nportrait of her sister, Julie Mengs; a copy of St. Jerome, or \"The\r\nDay\"--original in Parma--and \"The Night.\"\r\n\r\nA curious story has recently been published to the effect that in 1767\r\nthis artist sent word to Duke Xavier of Saxony that during the Seven\r\nYears' War she painted a copy in miniature of Correggio's \"Holy Mother\r\nwith the Christ Child, Mary Magdalen, Hieronymus, and Two Angels,\" which\r\nshe sent by Cardinal Albani to the Duke's father--Frederick Augustus II.\r\nof Saxony and Augustus III. of Poland--at Warsaw. It was claimed that two\r\nhundred and fifty ducats were due her. Apparently the demand was not met;\r\nbut, on the other hand, the lady seems to have received for some years a\r\npension of three hundred thalers from the Electorate of Saxony without\r\nmaking any return. Probably her claim was satisfied by this pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MOSER, MARY.</b> One of the original members of the London Academy. The\r\ndaughter of a German artist, who resided in London. She was as well known\r\nfor her wit as for her art. A friend of Fuseli, she was said to be as\r\nmuch in love with him as he was in love with Angelica Kauffman. Dr.\r\nJohnson sometimes met Miss Moser at the house of Nollekens, where they\r\nmade merry over a cup of tea.\r\n\r\nQueen Charlotte commissioned this painter to decorate a chamber, for\r\nwhich work she paid more than nine hundred pounds, and was so well\r\npleased that she complimented the artist by commanding the apartment to\r\nbe called \"Miss Moser's Room.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MOTT, MRS. ALICE.</b> Born at Walton on Thames. Pupil of the Slade\r\nSchool and Royal Academy in London, and of M. Charles Chaplin in Paris in\r\nhis studio. A miniaturist whose works are much esteemed. Her work is\r\nlife-like, artistic, and strong in drawing, color, and composition. After\r\nfinishing her study under masters she took up miniature painting by\r\nherself, studying the works of old miniaturists.\r\n\r\nRecently she writes me: \"I have departed from the ordinary portrait\r\nminiature, and am now painting what I call picture miniatures. For\r\ninstance, I am now at work on the portrait of Miss D. C., who is in\r\nold-fashioned dress, low bodice, and long leg-of-mutton sleeves. She is\r\nrepresented as running in the open, with sky and tree background. She has\r\na butterfly net over her shoulder, which floats out on the wind; she is\r\nlooking up and smiling; her hair and her sash are blown out. It is to be\r\ncalled, 'I'd be a Butterfly.' The dress is the yellow of the common\r\nbutterfly. It is a large miniature. I hope to send it, with others, to\r\nthe St. Louis Exposition.\"\r\n\r\nHer miniatures are numerous and in private hands. A very interesting one\r\nbelongs to the Bishop of Ripon and is a portrait of Mrs. Carpenter, his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MUNTZ, LAURA A.</b>\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MURRAY, ELIZABETH.</b> Member of the Institute of Painters in\r\nWater-Colors, London, and of the American Society of Water-Color\r\nPainters, New York.

She has made a\r\nstudy of antique pottery and has been successful in its imitation. Her\r\nvases and amphorae have been frequently exhibited and are praised by\r\nconnoisseurs and critics. At the Italian National Exposition, 1880, she\r\nexhibited a terra-cotta reproduction of a classic design, painted in\r\noils; also a wooden dish which resembled an antique ceramic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>NELLI, PLAUTILLA.</b> There is a curious fact connected with two women\r\nartists of Florence in the middle of the sixteenth century. In that city\r\nof pageants--where Ghirlandajo saw, in the streets, in churches, and on\r\nvarious ceremonial occasions, the beautiful women with whom he still\r\nmakes us acquainted--these ladies, daughters of noble Florentine\r\nfamilies, were nuns.\r\n\r\nNo Shakespearean dissector has, to my knowledge, affirmed that Hamlet's\r\nadvice to Ophelia, \"Get thee to a nunnery,\" and his assertion, \"I have\r\nheard of your paintings, too,\" prove that Ophelia was an artist and a\r\nnunnery a favorable place in which to set up a studio. Yet I think I\r\ncould make this assumption as convincing as many that have been \"proved\"\r\nby the _post obitum_ atomizers of the great poet's every word.\r\n\r\nBut we have not far to seek for the reasons which led Plautilla Nelli and\r\nMaria Maddalena de' Pazzi to choose the conventual life. The subjects of\r\ntheir pictures prove that their thoughts were fixed on a life quite out\r\nof tune with that which surrounded them in their homes. If they pictured\r\nrich draperies and rare gems, it was but to adorn with them the Blessed\r\nVirgin Mother and the holy saints, in token of their belief that all of\r\npomp and value in this life can but faintly symbolize the glory of the\r\nlife to come.\r\n\r\nPlautilla Nelli, born in Florence in 1523, entered the convent of St.\r\nCatherine of Siena, in her native city, and in time became its abbess.\r\nPatiently, with earnest prayer, she studied and copied the works of Fra\r\nBartolommeo and Andrea del Sarto, until she was able to paint an original\r\n\"Adoration of the Magi\" of such excellence as to secure her a place among\r\nthe painters of Florence.\r\n\r\nMany of her pictures remained in her convent, but she also painted a\r\n\"Madonna Surrounded by Saints\" for the choir of Santa Lucia at Pistoja.\r\nThere are pictures attributed to Plautilla Nelli in Berlin--notably the\r\n\"Visit of Martha to Christ,\"--which are characterized by the earnestness,\r\npurity, and grace of her beloved Fra Bartolommeo. Her \"Adoration of the\r\nWise Men\" is at Parma; the \"Descent from the Cross\" in Florence; the\r\n\"Last Supper\" in the church of Santa Maria Novella, Florence.\r\n\r\nThere are traditions of her success as a teacher of painting in her\r\nconvent, but of this we have no exact knowledge such as we have of the\r\nwork of the \"Suor Plautilla,\" the name by which she came to be known in\r\nall Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>NEMES-RANSONNETT, COUNTESS ELISA.</b> Born at Vienna, 1843. She studied\r\nsuccessively with Vastagh, Lulos, Aigner, Schilcher, Lenbach, Angeli, and\r\nJ. Benczur, and opened her studio at Kun Szent Miklos near Budapest. The\r\n\"Invitation to the Wedding\" was well received, and her portraits of\r\nSchiller and Perczel are in public galleries--the former in the Vienna\r\nKünstlerhaus, and the latter in the Deputy House at Budapest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>NEWCOMB, MARIA GUISE.</b> Born in New Jersey. Pupil of Schenck,\r\nChialiva, and Edouard Detaille in Paris. Travelled in Algeria and the\r\nSahara, studying the Arab and his horses. Very few artists can be\r\ncompared with Miss Newcomb in representing horses. She has a genius for\r\nportraying this animal, and understands its anatomy as few painters have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nShe was but a child when sketching horses and cattle was her pastime, and\r\nso great was her fondness for it that the usual dolls and other toys were\r\ncrowded out of her life. Her studies in Paris were comprehensive, and her\r\nwork shows the results and places her among the distinguished painters of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>NEY, ELISABETH.</b> Born in 1830.

The subject of each is slight;\r\neach stroke of her brush is made once and for all, with a precision and\r\ndash that are inspiriting; and you have in each painting the sparkle, the\r\ndeft lightness of touch, the instantaneous impression of form and\r\ncoloring that a water-color should have.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INDIAN AFTER THE CHASE\r\n\r\nRHODA HOLMES NICHOLS]\r\n\r\nMrs. Nicholls is also known as an illustrator. Harold Payne says of her:\r\n\"Rhoda Holmes Nicholls, although an illustrator of the highest order,\r\ncannot be strictly classed as one, for the reason that she is equally\r\ngreat in every other branch of art. However, as many of her best examples\r\nof water-colors are ultimately reproduced for illustrative purposes, and\r\nas even her oil paintings frequently find their way into the pages of art\r\npublications, it is not wrong to denominate her as an illustrator, and\r\nthat of the most varied and prolific type. She may, like most artists,\r\nhave a specialty, but a walk through her studio and a critical\r\nexamination of her work--ranging all along the line of oil paintings,\r\nwater-colors of the most exquisite type, wash drawings, crayons, and\r\npastels--would scarcely result in discovering her specialty.... As a\r\ncolorist she has few rivals, and her acute knowledge of drawing and\r\ngenius for composition are apparent in everything she does.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>NICHOLS, CATHERINE MAUDE, R.

She has executed more than a hundred copper\r\nplates, chiefly dry-points. The pictures in oils and water-colors, the\r\nminiatures and the proofs of her works have found purchasers, almost\r\nwithout exception, and are in private hands. Most of the plates she has\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nMiss Nichols has illustrated some books, her own poems being of the\r\nnumber, as well as her \"Old Norwich.\" She has also made illustrations for\r\njournals and magazines.\r\n\r\nOne is impressed most agreeably with the absence of mannerism in Miss\r\nNichols' work, as well as with the pronounced artistic treatment of her\r\nsubjects. Her sketches of sea and river scenery are attractive; the views\r\nfrom her home county, Norfolk, have a delightful feeling about them.\r\n\"Norwich River at Evening\" is not only a charming picture, but shows, in\r\nits perspective and its values, the hand of a skilful artist. \"Mousehold\r\nHeath,\" showing a rough and broken country, is one of her strongest\r\npictures in oils; \"Stretching to the Sea\" is also excellent. Among the\r\nwater-colors \"Strangers' Hall,\" Norwich, and \"Fleeting Clouds,\" merit\r\nattention, as do a number of others. One could rarely see so many works,\r\nwith such varied subjects, treated in oils, water-colors, dry point,\r\netc., by the same artist.\r\n\r\nI quote the following paragraph from the _Studio_ of April, 1903: \"Miss\r\nC.

Among\r\nher pictures are \"Reietti,\" \"The Good-Natured One,\" \"September,\" \"In the\r\nCountry,\" \"Music,\" and \"Contrasts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>NORMAND, MRS.

Born in New\r\nJersey, but has lived in New York, where she studied at the Art\r\nStudents' League under Carroll Beckwith. Pupil of Collin and Aman-Jean in\r\nParis and Charles Lasar in England; also in Philadelphia of Joseph de\r\nCamp, Henry Thouron, Cecilia Beaux, and Howard Pyle.\r\n\r\nMiss Oakley has executed mural decorations, a mosaic reredos, and five\r\nstained-glass windows in the Church of All Saints, New York City, and a\r\nwindow in the Convent of the Holy Child, at Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1903 she was commissioned to decorate the walls of the\r\nGovernor's reception room in the new Capitol at Harrisburg. Before\r\nengaging in this work--the first of its kind to be confided to an\r\nAmerican woman--Miss Oakley went to Italy to study mural painting. She\r\nthen went to England to thoroughly inform herself concerning the\r\nhistorical foundation of her subject, the history of the earliest days of\r\nPennsylvania. At Oxford and in London she found what she required, and on\r\nher return to America established herself in a studio in Villa Nova,\r\nPennsylvania, to make her designs for \"The Romance of the Founding of the\r\nState,\" which is to be painted on a frieze five feet deep. The room is\r\nseventy by thirty feet, and sixteen feet in height.\r\n\r\nThe decoration of this Capitol is to be more elaborate and costly than\r\nthat of any other public edifice in the United States. In mural\r\ndecoration Miss Oakley will be associated with Edwin A. Abbey, but the\r\nGovernor's room is to be her work entirely, and will doubtless occupy her\r\nduring several years.\r\n\r\nMr Charles A. Caffin, in his article upon the exhibition of the New York\r\nWater-Color Club, January, 1904, says: \"Miss Oakley has had considerable\r\nexperience in designing stained-glass windows, and has reproduced in some\r\nof her designs for book covers a corresponding treatment of the\r\ncomposition, with an attempt, not very logical or desirable, considering\r\nthe differences between paint and glass, to reproduce also something of\r\nher window color schemes.... But for myself, her cover, in which some\r\ngirls are picking flowers, is far more charming in its easy grace of\r\ncomposition, choice gravity of color, and spontaneity of feeling. Here is\r\nrevealed a very _naïve_ imagination, free of any obsessions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>OCCIONI, SIGNORA LUCILLA MARZOLO.</b> Diploma of gold medal at the\r\nWomen's Exhibition, Earl's Court, London, 1900. Born in Trieste. Pupil,\r\nin Rome, of Professor Giuseppe Ferrari.\r\n\r\nThis artist paints figure subjects, portraits, landscapes, and flowers,\r\nin both oils and water-colors, and also makes pen-drawings. Her works are\r\nin many private galleries. She gives me no list of subjects. Her pictures\r\nhave been praised by critics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>O'CONNELL, FREDERIQUE EMILIE AUGUSTE MIETHE.</b> Born in Potsdam.\r\n1823-1885. She passed her early life in her native city, having all the\r\nadvantages of a solid and brilliant education. She early exhibited a love\r\nof drawing and devoted herself to the study of anatomical plates. She\r\nsoon designed original subjects and introduced persons of her own\r\nimagination, which early marked her as powerful in her fancy and original\r\nin her manner of rendering her ideas.\r\n\r\nA picture of \"Raphael and the Fornarina,\" which she executed at the age\r\nof fifteen, was so satisfactory as to determine her fate, and she was\r\nallowed to study art.\r\n\r\nWhen about eighteen years old she became the pupil of Charles Joseph\r\nBegas, a very celebrated artist of Berlin. Under his supervision she\r\npainted her first picture, called the \"Day of the Dupes,\" which, though\r\nfull of faults, had also virtues enough to secure much attention in the\r\nexhibition. It was first hung in a disadvantageous position, but the\r\ncrowd discovered its merits and would have it noticed. She received a\r\ncomplimentary letter from the Academy of Berlin, and the venerable artist\r\nCornelius made her a visit of congratulation.\r\n\r\nAbout 1844 she married and removed to Brussels. Here she came into an\r\nentirely new atmosphere and her manner of painting was changed. She\r\nsought to free herself from all outer influence and to express her own\r\nfeeling. She studied color especially, and became an imitator of Rubens.\r\nShe gained in Brussels all the medals of the Belgian expositions, and\r\nthere began two historical pictures, \"Peter the Great and Catherine\" and\r\n\"Maria Theresa and Frederick the Great.\" These were not finished until\r\nafter her removal to Paris in 1853. They were bought by Prince Demidoff\r\nfor the Russian Government.\r\n\r\nShe obtained her first triumph in Paris, at the Salon of 1853, by a\r\nportrait of Rachel. She represented the famous actress dressed entirely\r\nin white, with the worn expression which her professional exertions and\r\nthe fatal malady from which she was already suffering had given to her\r\nremarkable face. The critics had no words for this portrait which were\r\nnot words of praise, and two years later, in 1855, Madame O'Connell\r\nreached the height of her talent. \"A Faunesse,\" as it was called, in the\r\nexposition of that year, was a remarkable work, and thus described by\r\nBarty:\r\n\r\n\"A strong and beautiful young woman was seated near a spring, where\r\nbeneath the shade of the chestnut trees the water lilies spread\r\nthemselves out upon the stream which flowed forth. She was nude and her\r\nflesh palpitated beneath the caresses of the sun. With feminine caprice\r\nshe wore a bracelet of pearls of the style of the gold workers of the\r\nRenaissance. Her black hair had lights of golden brown upon it, and she\r\nopened her great brown eyes with an expression of indifference. A half\r\nsmile played upon her rosy lips and lessened the oval of the face like\r\nthat of the 'Dancing Faun.' The whole effect of the lines of the figure\r\nwas bold and gave an appearance of youth, the extremities were studiously\r\nfinished, the skin was fine, and the whole tournure elegant. It was a\r\nFaunesse of Fontainebleau of the time of the Valois.\"\r\n\r\nMme. O'Connell then executed several fine portraits--two of Rachel, one\r\nof M. O'Connell, others of Charles Edward and Théophile Gautier, which\r\nwere likened to works of Vandyck, and a portrait in crayon of herself\r\nwhich was a _chef-d'oeuvre_. She excelled in rendering passionate\r\nnatures; she found in her palette the secret of that pallor which spreads\r\nitself over the faces of those devoted to study--the fatigues of days and\r\nnights without sleep; she knew how to kindle the feverish light in the\r\neyes of poets and of the women of society. She worked with great\r\nfreedom, used a thick pâte in which she brushed freely and left the\r\nridges thus made in the colors; then, later, she put over a glaze, and\r\nall was done. Her etchings were also executed with great freedom, and\r\nmany parts, especially the hair, were remarkably fine. She finished\r\nnumerous etchings, among which a \"St. Magdalen in the Desert\" and a\r\n\"Charity Surrounded by Children\" are worthy of particular notice.\r\n\r\nAfter Madame O'Connell removed to Paris she opened a large atelier and\r\nreceived many pupils. It was a most attractive place, with gorgeous\r\npieces of antique furniture, loaded with models of sculpture, books,\r\nalbums, engravings, and so on, while draperies, tapestries, armor, and\r\nornaments in copper and brass all lent their colors and effects to\r\nenhance the attractions of the place. Many persons of rank and genius\r\nwere among the friends of the artist and she was much in society.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all her talent and all her success the end of Madame\r\nO'Connell's life was sad beyond expression. Her health suffered, her\r\nreason tottered and faded out, yet life remained and she was for years in\r\nan asylum for the insane. Everything that had surrounded her in her Paris\r\nhome was sold at auction. No time was given and no attempt was made to\r\nbring her friends together. No one who had known or loved her was there\r\nto shed a tear or to bear away a memento of her happy past. All the\r\nbeautiful things of which we have spoken were sacrificed and scattered as\r\nunconscionably as if she had never loved or her friends enjoyed them.\r\n\r\nIn the busy world of Paris no one remembered the brilliant woman who had\r\nflashed upon them, gained her place among them, and then disappeared.\r\nThey recalled neither her genius nor her womanly qualities which they had\r\nadmired, appreciated, and so soon forgotten!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>OOSTERWYCK, MARIA VAN.</b> The seventeenth century is remarkable for the\r\nperfection attained in still-life and flower painting. The most famous\r\nmasters in this art were William van Aelst of Delft, the brothers De Heem\r\nof Utrecht, William Kalf and the Van Huysums of Amsterdam. The last of\r\nthis name, however, Jan van Huysum, belongs to the next century.\r\n\r\nMaria van Oosterwyck and Rachel Ruysch disputed honors with the above\r\nnamed and are still famous for their talents.\r\n\r\nThe former was a daughter of a preacher of the reformed religion. She was\r\nborn at Nootdorp, near Delft, in 1630. She was the pupil of Jan David de\r\nHeem, and her pictures were remarkable for accuracy in drawing, fine\r\ncoloring, and an admirable finish.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. of France, William III. of England, the Emperor Leopold of\r\nGermany, and Augustus I. of Poland gave her commissions for pictures.\r\nLarge prices were paid her in a most deferential manner, as if the\r\ntributes of friendship rather than the reward of labor, and to these\r\ngenerous sums were added gifts of jewels and other precious objects.\r\n\r\nOf Maria van Oosterwyck Kugler writes: \"In my opinion she does not occupy\r\nthat place in the history of the art of this period that she deserves,\r\nwhich may be partly owing to the rarity of her pictures, especially in\r\npublic galleries. For although her flower pieces are weak in arrangement\r\nand often gaudy in the combination of color, she yet represents her\r\nflowers with the utmost truth of drawing, and with a depth, brilliancy,\r\nand juiciness of local coloring _unattained by any other flower painter_\"\r\n\r\nA picture in the Vienna Gallery of a sunflower with tulips and poppies,\r\nin glowing color, is probably her best work in a public collection. Her\r\npictures are also in the galleries of Dresden, Florence, Carlsruhe,\r\nCopenhagen, the Schwerin Gallery, and the Metropolitan Museum of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThere is a romantic story told of Maria van Oosterwyck, as follows.\r\nWilliam van Aelst, the painter of exquisite pictures of still-life,\r\nfruits, glass, and objects in gold and silver, was a suitor for her hand.\r\nShe did not love him, but wishing not to be too abrupt in her refusal,\r\nshe required, as a condition of his acceptance, that he should work ten\r\nhours a day during a year. This he readily promised to do. His studio\r\nbeing opposite that of Maria, she watched narrowly for the days when he\r\ndid not work and marked them down on her window-sash. At the close of the\r\nyear Van Aelst claimed her as his bride, assuming that he had fulfilled\r\nher condition; but she pointed to the record of his delinquencies, and he\r\ncould but accept her crafty dismissal of his suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>OSENGA, GIUSEPPINA.</b> This artist resides in Parma, and has there\r\nexhibited landscapes that are praised for their color and for the manner\r\nin which they are painted, as well as for the attractive subjects she\r\nhabitually chooses. \"A View near Parma,\" the \"Faces of Montmorency,\" and\r\nthe \"Bridge of Attaro\" are three of her works which are especially\r\nadmired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>OSTERTAG, BLANCHE.</b> Member of Society of Western Artists; Arts Club,\r\nChicago; Municipal Art League. Born in St. Louis. From 1892-1896 pupil of\r\nLaurens and Raphael Collin in Paris, where her works were hung on the\r\nline at the New Gallery, Champ de Mars.\r\n\r\nA decorative artist who has executed mural decoration in a private house\r\nin Chicago, and has illustrated \"Max Müller's Memories\" and other\r\npublications. For use in schools she made a color print, \"Reading of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence before the Army.\"\r\n\r\nHer calendars and posters are in demand by collectors at home and in\r\nforeign countries. Miss Ostertag has designed elaborate chimney pieces to\r\nbe executed in mosaic and glass. Her droll conceits in \"Mary and Her\r\nLamb,\" the \"Ten Little Injuns,\" and other juvenile tales were\r\ncomplimented by Boutet de Monvel, who was so much interested in her work\r\nthat he gave her valuable criticism and advice without solicitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>O'TAMA-CHIOVARA.</b> Gold medal at an exhibition of laces in Rome and\r\nprizes at all the exhibitions held in Palermo by the Art Club. Born in\r\nTokio, where she came to the notice of Vicenzo Ragusa, a Sicilian\r\nsculptor in the employ of the Japanese Government at Tokio. He taught her\r\ndesign, color, and modelling, and finally induced her to go with his\r\nsister to Palermo. Here her merit was soon recognized in a varied\r\ncollection of water-colors representing flowers and fruits, which were\r\nreproduced with surpassing truth. When the School of Applied Art was\r\ninstituted at Palermo in 1887, she was put in charge of the drawing,\r\nwater-color, and modelling in the Women's Section.\r\n\r\nShe knows the flowers of various countries--those of Japan and Sicily\r\nwonderfully well, and her fancy is inexhaustible; her exquisite\r\nembroideries reflect this quality. She has many private pupils, and is as\r\nmuch beloved for her character as she is admired for her talents. When\r\nshe renounced Buddhism for Christianity, the Princess of Scalca was her\r\ngodmother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PACZKA-WAGNER, CORNELIA.</b> Honorable mention, Berlin, 1890. Born in\r\nGöttingen, 1864. She has been, in the main, her own instructor, living\r\nfor some years in Rome for the purpose of study. In 1895 she settled in\r\nBerlin, where she has made a specialty of women's and children's\r\nportraits in olgraphy (?) and lithography. Beautiful drawings by her were\r\nexhibited at the International Water-Color Exhibition in Dresden, 1892.\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of a visit to the studio of the Hungarian painter\r\nPaczka and his German wife tells of a strong series of paintings in\r\nprogress there, under the general title, \"A Woman's Soul.\" In freedom and\r\nboldness of conception they were said to remind one of Klinger, but in\r\nwarmth and depth of feeling to surpass him. Frau Paczka had just finished\r\na very large picture, representing the first couple after the expulsion\r\nfrom Paradise. The scene is on the waste, stony slope of a mountain; the\r\nsun shines with full force in the background, while upon the unshadowed\r\nrocks of the foreground are the prostrate Adam and his wife--more\r\naccusing than complaining.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Frau Paczka exhibited in Berlin, \"Vanitas,\" which excels in\r\nrichness of fancy and boldness of representation, while wanting somewhat\r\nin detail; the ensemble presents a remarkably fine, symbolic composition,\r\nwhich sets forth in rich color the dance of mankind before the golden\r\ncalf, and the bitter disillusions in the struggle for fame, wealth, and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PARLAGHY, VILMA, OR THE PRINCESS LWOFF.</b> Great gold medal from the\r\nEmperor of Austria, 1890; great gold medal, 1894; small gold medal at\r\nBerlin, 1890, adjudged to her portrait of Windhorst. Born at Hadju-Dorogh\r\nin 1863, and studied in Budapest, Munich, Venice, Florence, and Turin.\r\nHer portraits having found great favor at the Court of Berlin, she\r\nremoved her studio from Munich to that capital.\r\n\r\nOne of her instructors was Lenbach, and she is said by some critics to\r\nhave appropriated his peculiarities as a colorist and his shortcomings in\r\ndrawing, without attaining his geniality and power of divination. In 1891\r\nher portrait of Count von Moltke, begun shortly before his death and\r\nfinished afterward, was sent to the International Exposition at Berlin,\r\nbut was rejected. The Emperor, however, bought it for his private\r\ncollection, and at his request it was given a place of honor at the\r\nExposition, the incident causing much comment. She exhibited a portrait\r\nof the Emperor William at Berlin in 1893, which Rosenberg called careless\r\nin drawing and modelling and inconceivable in its unrefreshing,\r\ndirty-gray color.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1895, she gave an exhibition of one hundred and four of her\r\nworks, mostly portraits, including those of the Emperor, Caprivi, von\r\nMoltke, and Kossuth, which had previously been exhibited in Berlin,\r\nMunich, and Paris. The proceeds of this exhibition went to the building\r\nfund of the Emperor William Memorial Church.\r\n\r\nOf a portrait exhibited in 1896, at Munich, a critic said that while it\r\nwas not wholly bad, it was no better than what hundreds of others could\r\ndo as well, and hundreds of others could do much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PASCH, ULRICKE FRIEDERIKA.</b> Member of the Academy of Fine Arts of\r\nSweden. Born in Stockholm. 1735-1796. A portrait of Gustavus-Adolphus II.\r\nby this artist is in the Castle at Stockholm. She was a sister of Lorenz\r\nPasch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PASCOLI, LUIGIA.</b> This Venetian painter has exhibited in various\r\nItalian cities since 1870, when she sent a \"Magdalen\" to Parma. \"First\r\nLove\" appeared at Naples in 1877, and \"The Maskers\"--pastel--at Venice in\r\n1881. A \"Girl with a Cat,\" a \"Roman Girl,\" and a \"Seller of Eggs\"--the\r\nlatter in Venetian costume--are works of true value. Her copies of\r\nTitian's \"St. Mark\" and of Gian Bellini's \"Supper at Emmaus\" have\r\nattracted attention and are much esteemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PASSE, MAGDALENA VAN DE.</b> Born at Utrecht about 1600; she died at the\r\nage of forty. This engraver was a daughter of Crispus van de Passe, the\r\nelder. She practised her art in Germany, England, Denmark, and the\r\nNetherlands, and was important as an artist. Her engraving was\r\nexceedingly careful and skilful. Among her plates are \"Three Sibyls,\"\r\n1617; an \"Annunciation,\" \"Cephalus and Procris,\" \"Latona,\" and landscapes\r\nafter the works of Bril, Savery, Willars, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PATTISON, HELEN SEARLE.</b> Born in Burlington, Vermont. Daughter of\r\nHenry Searle, a talented architect who moved to Rochester, New York,\r\nwhere his daughter spent much of her girlhood. She held the position of\r\nart teacher in a school in Batavia, New York, while still a girl herself.\r\n\r\nAbout 1860 she became the pupil of Herr Johan Wilhelm Preyer, the\r\nwell-known painter of still-life, fruit, and flowers. Preyer was a dwarf\r\nand an excellent man, but as a rule took no pupils. He was much\r\ninterested in Miss Searle, and made an exception in her case. She soon\r\nacquired the technique of her master and painted much as he did, but with\r\nless minute detail, finer color, and far more sentiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOWERS\r\n\r\nHELEN SEARLE PATTISON]\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Miss Searle married the artist, James William Pattison, now on\r\nthe staff of the Art Institute, Chicago. After their marriage Mr. and\r\nMrs. Pattison resided at Écouen, near Paris. Returning to America in\r\n1882, they spent some time in Chicago and New York City, removing to\r\nJacksonville, Illinois, in 1884. Here Mr. Pattison was at the head of the\r\nSchool of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pattison lived but a few months in Jacksonville, dying in November,\r\n1884.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pattison's artistic reputation was well established and her works\r\nwere exhibited at the Paris Salon and in all the German cities of\r\nimportance. They were frequently seen in England and at the National\r\nAcademy of Design in New York. Her subjects were still-life, fruit,\r\nand flowers, and her works are widely distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PAZZI, CATERINA DE</b>, whose conventual name was Maria Maddalena. Was\r\nborn in Florence in 1566. It would be interesting to know the relation\r\nthat this gentle lady bore to those Pazzi who had earned a fame so unlike\r\nhers fourscore years before she saw the light.\r\n\r\nCaterina de Pazzi, when a mere girl, entered a convent which stood on the\r\nsite of the church known by her name in the Via Pinti. The cell of Santa\r\nMaddalena--now a chapel--may still be visited. She was canonized by Pope\r\nAlexander VIII. in 1670, sixty-two years after her death.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines have many lovely legends associated with her memory. One\r\nof these relates that she painted pictures of sacred subjects when\r\nasleep. Be this as it may, we know that her pictures were esteemed in the\r\ndays when the best artists lived and worked beside her. Examples of her\r\nart may still be seen in churches in Rome and Parma, as well as in the\r\nchurch of her native city which bears her name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PEALE, ANNA C.</b> Made her mark as a miniature painter and for some\r\nyears was the only professional woman artist in Philadelphia. Her\r\nportrait of General Jackson made in 1819 was well considered. She also\r\nmade portraits of President Monroe, Henry Clay, R. M. Johnson, John\r\nRandolph of Roanoke, and other prominent men. Miss Peale married in 1829\r\nthe Rev. William Staughton, a Baptist clergyman, the president of the\r\ntheological college at Georgetown, Kentucky. He lived but three months\r\nafter their marriage, and she returned to Philadelphia and again pursued\r\nher artistic labors. She married a second husband, General William\r\nDuncan, and from this time gave up professional painting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PEALE, SARA M.</b> 1860-1885. Daughter of James Peale, under whose\r\nteaching she made her first studies. She was also a pupil of her uncle,\r\nthe founder of Peale's Museum, Philadelphia. Miss Peale painted portraits\r\nand spent some years in Baltimore and Washington. Among her portraits are\r\nthose of Lafayette, Thomas Benton, Henry A. Wise, Caleb Cushing, and\r\nother distinguished men. From 1847 she resided in St. Louis thirty years\r\nand then went to Philadelphia. Her later works were still-life subjects,\r\nespecially fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PELICHY, GEERTRUIDA.</b> Honorary member of the Academy of Vienna. Born\r\nin Utrecht, 1744; died in Brügge, 1825. Pupil of P. de Cock and Suvée. In\r\n1753, she went to Brügge with her father, and later to Paris and Vienna.\r\nShe painted portraits of the Emperor Joseph II. and Maria Theresa, some\r\ngood landscapes, and animal studies. Two of her pictures are in the\r\nMuseum at Brügge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PELLEGRINO, ITALA.</b> Born at Milan, 1865. Pupil of Battaglia. Her\r\npictures are of genre and marine subjects. At the great exhibition at\r\nTurin, 1884, she exhibited a marine view which was bought by Prince\r\nAmadeo. Another marine view exhibited at Milan was acquired by the\r\nSocietà Promotrice. In 1888 she sent to the exhibition at Naples, where\r\nshe resides, a view of Portici, which was added to the Royal Gallery. The\r\nexcellence of her work is in the strength and certainty of touch and the\r\nsincerity and originality of composition. She has painted a \"Marine View\r\nof Naples,\" \"In the Gulf,\" \"Fair Weather,\" and \"Evening at Sea\"; also a\r\ngenre picture, \"Frusta là,\" which was sold while in an exhibition in\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PENICKE, CLARA.</b> Born at Berlin in 1818, where she died in 1899. She\r\nstudied first with Remy and later with Carl Begas and Edward Magnus. Her\r\nwork was largely confined to portrait and historical painting. In the\r\nGallery at Schwerin is her \"Elector Frederick of Saxony Refusing to\r\nAccept the Interim.\" Another good example of her historical work is the\r\n\"Reconciliation of Charlemagne with Thassilo of Bavaria.\" A well-known\r\nand strongly modelled portrait of Minister Von Stoach and several Luther\r\nportraits, \"Luther's Family Devotion\" and \"Luther Finds the First Latin\r\nBible,\" show her facility in this branch of art. She also painted a\r\n\"Christ on the Cross.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PERELLI, LIDA.</b> A landscape painter living in Milan, who has become\r\nwell known by pictures that have been seen at the exhibitions in several\r\nItalian cities, especially through some Roman studies that appeared at\r\nFlorence and Turin in 1884. \"A View of Lecco, Lake Como,\" \"Casolare,\" and\r\n\"A Lombard Plain\" are among her best works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PERMAN, LOUISE E.</b> Born at Birkenshaw, Renfrewshire. Studied in\r\nGlasgow. This artist paints roses, and roses only, in oils. In this art\r\nshe has been very successful. She has exhibited at the Royal Academy and\r\nthe New Gallery, London; at the Royal Scottish Academy, Glasgow; at art\r\nexhibits in Munich, Dresden, Berlin, Prague, Hanover, etc., and wherever\r\nher works have been seen they have been sold. In May, 1903, a collection\r\nof twenty-five rose pictures were exhibited by a prominent dealer, and\r\nbut few were left in his hands.\r\n\r\nA critic in the _Studio_ of April, 1903, writing of the exhibition at the\r\nLadies' Artists' Club, Glasgow, says: \"Miss Louise Perman's rose pictures\r\nwere as refined and charming as ever. This last-named lady certainly has\r\na remarkable power of rendering the beauties of the queen of flowers,\r\nwhether she chooses to paint the sumptuous yellow of the 'Maréchal Niel,'\r\nthe blush of the 'Katherine Mermet,' or the crimson glory of the 'Queen\r\nof Autumn.' She seems not only to give the richness of color and fulness\r\nof contour of the flowers, but to capture for the delight of the beholder\r\nthe very spiritual essence of them.\" To the London Academy, 1903, she\r\nsent a picture called \"York and Lancaster.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PERRIER, MARIE.</b> Mention honorable at Salon des Artistes Français,\r\n1899; Prix Marie Bashkirtseff, 1899; honorable mention, Paris Exposition,\r\n1900; numerous medals from foreign and provincial exhibitions; medals in\r\ngold and silver at Rouen, Nîmes, Rennes, etc.; bronze medals at Amiens\r\nand Angers.

The scenery of Japan and\r\nits wonderfully beautiful Fuziyama would almost compel an artist to paint\r\nlandscapes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Perry says that her pictures of French and Japanese types are, in\r\nfact, portraits as truly as are those she is asked to paint.\r\n\r\nHer picture of a \"Japanese Lacemaker\" belongs to Mr. Quincy A. Shaw. It\r\nhas been much admired in the exhibitions in which it has been seen.\r\n\r\nIn the Water-Color Exhibition of the Boston Art Club, 1903, Mrs. Perry's\r\nportrait of Miss S. attracted much attention. The delicate flesh tones,\r\nthe excellent modelling of the features, and what may be called the whole\r\natmosphere of the picture combine in producing an effective and pleasing\r\nexample of portraiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PERUGINI, CATERINA E.</b> An Italian painter living in London, where she\r\nfrequently exhibits her excellent pictures.

Miss Peters travelled over Europe\r\nand was commissioned to decorate apartments in the royal castles at\r\nStuttgart and Friedrichshafen.\r\n\r\nHer picture of \"Roses and Grapes\" is in the National Gallery, London; and\r\none of \"Autumn Flowers\" in the Museum at Stuttgart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PILLINI, MARGHERITA.</b> An Italian painter living in Paris. Her most\r\nsuccessful exhibitions have been those at Rome, in 1883, when her\r\n\"Silk-cocoon Carder of Quimper\" and \"Charity\" appeared; and at Turin, in\r\n1884, when \"The Three Ages,\" \"The Poor Blind Man,\" and a portrait of the\r\nPrince of Naples were shown, all exquisite in sentiment and excellent in\r\nexecution. The \"Silk-cocoon Carder of Quimper\" has been thus noticed by\r\nDe Rengis: \"If I am not mistaken, Signora Margherita Pillini has also\r\ntaken this road, full of modernity, but not free from great danger. Her\r\n'Silk-cocoon Carder' is touched with great disdain for every suggestion\r\nof the old school. Rare worth--if worth it is--that a young woman should\r\nbe carried by natural inclination into such care for detail.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PINTO-SEZZI, IDA.</b> Silver medal at the Beatrice Exposition, Florence,\r\n1890. Since 1882 pictures by this artist have been seen in various\r\nItalian exhibitions. In the Beatrice of that year she exhibited\r\n\"Cocciara,\" and in 1887 \"A Friar Cook.\" Her \"Fortune-Teller\" attracted\r\ngeneral attention at Venice in 1887.\r\n\r\nThis artist has also given some time to the decoration of terra-cotta in\r\noil colors. An amphora decorated with landscape and figures was exhibited\r\nat the Promotrice in Florence in 1889 (?) and much admired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>POETTING, COUNTESS ADRIENNE.</b> Born in Chrudim, Bohemia, 1856. The\r\neffect of her thorough training under Blass, Straschiripka, and Frittjof\r\nSmith is seen in her portraits of the Deputy-Burgomaster Franz Khume,\r\nwhich is in the Rathhaus, Vienna, as well as in those of the Princess\r\nFreda von Oldenburg and the writer, Bertha von Suttner. Her excellence is\r\nalso apparent in her genre subjects, \"In the Land of Dreams\" being an\r\nexcellent example of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>POPERT, CHARLOTTE.</b> Silver medal at the Beatrice, Florence, 1890.\r\nBorn in Hamburg, 1848.

After extensive travels\r\nin the Orient, England, the Netherlands, and Spain, she established\r\nherself in Rome and painted chiefly in water-colors. Her \"Praying Women\r\nof Bethlehem\" is an excellent example of her art.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 she exhibited at Rome, \"In the Temple at Bethlehem\"; at Turin in\r\n1884, \"In the Seventeenth Century\" and \"The Nun\"; at Venice in 1887, an\r\nexquisite portrait in water-colors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>POPPE-LÜDERITZ, ELIZABETH.</b> Honorable mention, Berlin, 1891. For the\r\nsecond time only the Senate of the Berlin Academy conferred this\r\ndistinction upon a woman. The artist exhibited two portraits, \"painted\r\nwith Holbein-like delicacy and truthfulness\"--if we may agree with the\r\ncritics.\r\n\r\nThis artist was born in Berlin in 1858, and was a pupil of Gussow. Her\r\nbest pictures are portraits, but her \"Sappho\" and \"Euphrosine\" are\r\nexcellent works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>POPP, BABETTE.</b> Born in Regensburg, 1800; died about 1840.

Her husband, Johan Prestel, was her teacher, and she was of great\r\nassistance in the work which he produced at Frankfort-on-the-Main, in\r\n1783. In 1786, however, she separated from him and went to London, where\r\nshe devoted herself to aquatints. She executed more than seventy plates,\r\nsome of them of great size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PRESTEL, URSULA MAGDALENA.</b> Born in Nuremburg. 1777-1845. Daughter of\r\nthe preceding artist. She worked in Frankfort and London, travelled in\r\nFrance and Switzerland, and died in Brussels. Her moonlight scenes, some\r\nof her portraits, and her picture of the \"Falls of the Rhine near\r\nLaufen,\" are admirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PREUSCHEN, HERMINE VON SCHMIDT</b>; married name, Telman. Born at\r\nDarmstadt, 1857. Pupil of Ferdinand Keller in Karlsruhe. Travelled in\r\nSpain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Denmark. She remained some\r\ntime in Munich, Berlin, and Rome, establishing her studio in these cities\r\nand painting a variety of subjects. Her flower pictures are her best\r\nworks. Her \"Mors Imperator\" created a sensation by reason of its striking\r\nqualities rather than by intrinsic artistic merit. In the gallery at Metz\r\nis her picture of \"Irene von Spilimberg on the Funeral Gondola.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1883 she exhibited in Rome, \"Answered,\" a study of thistles; \"In\r\nAutumn,\" a variety of fruits; and \"Questions,\" a charming study of\r\ncarnations. At Berlin, in 1890, \"Meadow Saffron and Cineraria\" was\r\npraised for its glowing color and artistic arrangement. A Viennese\r\ncritic, the same year, lamented that an artist of so much talent should\r\npaint lifeless objects only. In Berlin, in 1894, she held an exhibition,\r\nin which her landscapes and flower pieces were better than her still-life\r\npictures. Frau Preuschen is also a musician and poet.\r\n\r\nThe painting of flower pieces is a delightful art for man or woman, but\r\nso many such pictures which are by amateurs are seen in exhibitions--too\r\ngood to be refused but not of a satisfactory quality--that one can\r\nscarcely sympathize with the critic who would have Mme. Preuschen paint\r\nother subjects than these charming blossoms, so exquisite in form and\r\ncolor, into which she paints so much delightful sentiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PUEHN, SOPHIE.</b> Born at Nuremberg, 1864. This artist studied in Paris\r\nand Munich and resides in the latter city. At the International\r\nExhibition, Vienna, 1894, her portrait of a \"Lady Drinking Tea\" was\r\npraised by the critics without exception, and, in fact, her portraits are\r\nalways well considered. That she is also skilful in etching was shown in\r\nher \"Forsaken,\" exhibited in 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PUTNAM, SARAH GOOLD.</b> Member of the Copley Society.

In 1884, at Turin, she exhibited\r\n\"Tea\" and the \"Four Ages\"; these, were excellent in tone and technique\r\nand attractive in subject. At Milan, 1886, her \"Will He Arrive?\" was\r\nheartily commended in the art journals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RAE, HENRIETTA.</b> See Normand, Mrs. Ernest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RAGUSA, ELEANORA.</b> See O'Tama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RAPIN, AIMÉE.</b> At the Swiss National Exposition, 1896, a large\r\npicture of a \"Genevese Watchmaker\" by this artist was purchased; By the\r\nGovernment and is in the Museum at Neuchâtel.

Member of the Société des Beaux-Arts of\r\nLausanne, Société des Femmes peintres et sculpteurs de la Suisse romande,\r\nSociété de l'exposition permanente des Beaux-Arts, Geneva. Born at\r\nPayerne, Canton de Vaud. Studied at Geneva under M. Hebert and Barthelmy\r\nMenn, in painting; Hugues Bovy, modelling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the Museum at Neuchâtel\r\n\r\nGENEVESE WATCHMAKER\r\n\r\nAIMÉE RAPIN]\r\n\r\nMlle. Rapin writes me: \"I am, above all, a portrait painter, and my\r\nportraits are in private hands.\" She names among others of her sitters,\r\nErnest Naville, the philosopher; Raoul Pictet, chemist; Jules Salmson,\r\nsculptor, etc. She mentions that she painted a portrait of the present\r\nPrincess of Wales at the time of her marriage, but as it was painted from\r\nphotographs the artist has no opinion about its truth to life. Mlle.\r\nRapin has executed many portraits of men, women, and children in Paris,\r\nLondon, and Germany, as well as in Switzerland. She refers me to the\r\nfollowing account of herself and her art. In the _Studio_ of April, 1903,\r\nR. M. writes: \"The subject of these notes is a striking example of the\r\ncompensations of Nature for her apparent cruelty; also of what the\r\ngenuine artist is capable of achieving notwithstanding the most singular\r\ndisadvantages. Some years ago in the little town of Payerne, Canton Vaud,\r\na child was born without arms. One day the mother, while standing near a\r\nrose-bush with her infant in her arms, was astonished to observe one of\r\nits tiny toes clasp the stem of the rose. Little did she guess at the\r\ntime that these prehensile toes were destined one day to serve an artist,\r\nin the execution of her work, with the same marvellous facility as hands.\r\nAs the child grew up the greatest care was bestowed upon her education.\r\nShe early manifested unmistakable artistic promise, and at the age of\r\nsixteen was sent to the École des Beaux Arts, Geneva.... For reasons\r\nalready mentioned Mlle. Rapin holds a unique position amongst that\r\nvaliant and distinguished group of Swiss lady artists to whose work we\r\nhope to have the opportunity of referring.... She is a fine example of\r\nthat singleness of devotion which characterizes the born artist. Her art\r\nis the all-absorbing interest of her life. It is not without its\r\nlimitations, but within these limitations the artist has known how to be\r\ntrue to herself. Drawing her inspiration direct from nature, she has held\r\non her independent way, steadily faithful to the gift she possesses of\r\nevoking a character in a portrait or of making us feel how the common\r\ntask, when representative of genuine human effort and touched with the\r\npoetry of national tradition, of religion, and of nature, becomes a\r\nsubject of noble artistic treatment. She has kept unimpaired that\r\n_merveilleux frisson de sensibilité_ which is one of the most precious\r\ngifts of the artistic temperament, and which is quick to respond to the\r\nideal in the real. There are some artists who, though possessed of\r\nextraordinary mastery over the materials of their art, bring to their\r\nwork a spirit which beggars and belittles both art and life; there are\r\nothers who seem to work with an ever-present sense of the noble purpose\r\nof their vocation and the pathos and dignity of existence. Mlle. Rapin\r\nbelongs to the second category. Her 'L'Horloger' is an example of this. A\r\nGenevese watchmaker is bending to his work at a bench covered with tools.\r\nThrough the window of the workshop one perceives in the blue distance\r\nMont Saléve, and nearer the time-honored towers of the Cathedral of St.\r\nPierre. Here is a composition dealing with simple life--a composition\r\nwhich, from the point of execution, color, and harmony of purpose, leaves\r\nlittle or nothing to be desired. But this is not all. It is, so to speak,\r\nan artistic _résumé_ of the life and history of the old city, and that\r\nstrongly portrayed national type gathers dignity from his alliance with\r\nthe generations who helped to make one of the main interests of the city,\r\nand from his relationship to that eventful past suggested by the\r\nCathedral and the Mountain.\r\n\r\n\"Mlle. Rapin is unmistakably one of the best Swiss portraitists, working\r\nfor the most part in pastels, her medium by predilection; she has at the\r\nsame time modelled portraits in bas-relief. We are not only impressed by\r\nthe intensely living quality of her work as a portraitist, but by the\r\nextraordinary power with which she has seized and expressed the\r\nindividual character and history of each of her subjects.\"\r\n\r\nMlle. Rapin has exhibited her works with success in Paris, Munich, and\r\nBerlin. The few specimens of her bas-reliefs which I have seen prove that\r\ndid she prefer the art of sculpture before that of painting, she would be\r\nas successful with her modelling tools as she has been with her brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RAPPARD, CLARA VON.</b> Second-class medal, London. Born at Wabern, near\r\nBerne, 1857. After studying with Skutelzky and Dreber, she worked under\r\nGussow in Berlin. She spent some time in travel, especially in Germany\r\nand Italy, and then, choosing Interlaken as her home, turned her\r\nattention to the illustration of books, as well as to portrait and genre\r\npainting. In the Museum at Freiburg is her \"Point-lace-maker.\" A series\r\nof sixteen \"Phantasies\" by this artist has been published in Munich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RATH, HENRIETTE.</b> Honorary member of the Société des Arts, 1801.

She has\r\nexhibited her works in the Paris Salon, in the National Academy of\r\nDesign, at the Society of American Artists' exhibitions, etc., and was\r\nawarded a medal at the World's Fair in Chicago. Her work is not only\r\nskilful and accurate in description and characterization; it is done with\r\nbreadth and freedom, and given a quality of fine decorative distinction.\r\nHer subjects are roses, cyclamen, chrysanthemums, nasturtiums, double\r\nlarkspurs, cinneraria, etc., and she makes each panel a distinct study in\r\ndesign, with a background and accessories of appropriate character. For\r\nexample, the three or four large panels of roses painted at Mentone have\r\na glimpse of the Mediterranean for background, and a suggestion of\r\ntrellis-work for the support of the vine or bush; and in another rose\r\npanel we have a tipped-over Gibraltar basket with its luscious contents\r\nstrewed about in artful confusion. The double larkspurs make very\r\ncharming panels for decorative purposes. They are painted with delightful\r\nfulness of color and engaging looseness and crispness of touch.\"--_Boston\r\nTranscript_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>REGIS, EMMA.</b> This Roman painter has given special attention to\r\nfigures, and has executed a number of portraits, one of the best of which\r\nis that of the Marchioness Durazzo Pallavicini.

Where the object of the picture is one sort of quality, I use\r\nthe method that seems to me to emphasize that quality.\"\r\n\r\nWhen but fourteen years old this artist exhibited at the National\r\nAcademy, New York, a picture of waves, \"The Wild Horses of the Sea,\"\r\nwhich was immediately sold and a duplicate ordered. In England Miss\r\nRichards has exhibited at the Academy, and her pictures have been\r\nselected for exhibitions in provincial galleries. Miss Richards is\r\nearnestly devoted to her art, and has in mind an end toward which she\r\ndiligently strives--not to become a painter distinguished for clever\r\nmannerism, but \"to attain a definite end; one which is difficult to reach\r\nand requires widely applied effort.\"\r\n\r\nJudging from what she has already done at her age, one may predict her\r\nsuccess in her chosen method. In February, 1903, Miss Richards and her\r\nfather exhibited their works in the Noe Galleries. I quote a few press\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAY DAY AT WHITELANDS COLLEGE, CHELSEA\r\n\r\nANNA M. RICHARDS]\r\n\r\n\"Miss Richards paints the sea well; she infuses interest into her\r\nfigures; she has a love of allegory; her studies in Holland and Norway\r\nare interesting. Her 'Whitby,' lighted by sunset, with figures massed in\r\nthe streets in dark relief against it, is beautiful. Her 'Friends,'\r\nshowing two women watching the twilight fading from the summits of a\r\nmountain range, the cedared slopes and river valley below meantime\r\ngathering blueness and shadow, is of such strength and sweetness of fancy\r\nthat it affects one like a strain of music.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Richards becomes symbolic or realistic by turn. Some of her figures\r\nare creatures of the imagination, winged and iridescent, like the 'Spirit\r\nof Hope.' Again, she paints good, honest Dutchmen, loafing about the\r\ndocks. Sometimes she has recourse to poetry and quotes Emerson for a\r\ntitle.... If technically she is not always convincing, it is apparent\r\nthat the artist is doing some thinking for herself, and her endeavors are\r\nin good taste.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Richards has written \"Letter and Spirit,\" containing fifty-seven\r\n\"Dramatic Sonnets of Inward Life.\"\r\n\r\nThese she has illustrated by sixty full-page pictures. Of these\r\ndrawings the eminent artist, G. F. Watts, says: \"In imaginative\r\ncomprehension they are more than illustrations; they are interpretations.\r\nI find in them an assemblage of great qualities--beauty of line, unity\r\nand abundance in composition, variety and appreciation of natural\r\neffects, with absence of manner; also unusual qualities in drawing,\r\nneither academical nor eccentric--all carried out with great purity and\r\ncompleteness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RICHARDS, SIGNORA EMMA GAGIOTTI.</b> Rome.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RIES, THERESE FEODOROWNA.</b> Bronze medal at Ekaterinburg; Karl Ludwig\r\ngold medal, Vienna; gold medal, Paris Exposition, 1900. Officer of the\r\nAcademy. Born in Moscow. Pupil of the Moscow Academy and of Professor\r\nHellmer, Vienna, women not being admitted to the Vienna Academy.\r\n\r\nA critic in the _Studio_ of July, 1901, who signs his article A. S. L.,\r\nwrites as follows of this remarkable artist: \"Not often does it fall to\r\nthe lot of a young artist to please both critic and public at the same\r\ntime, and, having gained their interest, to continue to fill their\r\nexpectations. But it was so with Feodorowna Ries, a young Russian artist\r\nwho some eight months ago had never even had a piece of clay in her hand,\r\nbut who, by dint of 'self,' now stands amongst the foremost of her\r\nprofession. It was chance that led Miss Ries to the brush, and another\r\nchance which led her to abandon the brush for the chisel. Five years ago\r\nshe was awarded the Carl Ludwig gold medal for her 'Lucifer,' and at the\r\nlast Paris Exhibition she gained the gold medal for her 'Unbesiegbaren'\r\n(The Unconquerable).\r\n\r\n\"Miss Ries was born and educated in Moscow, but Vienna is the city of her\r\nadoption. She first studied painting at the Moscow Academy, her work\r\nthere showing great breadth of character and power of delineation. At the\r\nyearly Exhibition in Moscow, held some five months after she had entered\r\nas a student, she took the gold medal for her 'Portrait of a Russian\r\nPeasant.' She then abandoned painting for sculpture, and one month later\r\ngained the highest commendations for a bust of 'Ariadne.' She then began\r\nto study the plastic art from life. Dissatisfied with herself, although\r\nher 'Somnambulist' gained a prize, Miss Ries left Moscow for Paris, but\r\non her way stayed in Vienna, studying under Professor Hellmer. One year\r\nlater, at the Vienna Spring Exhibition, she exhibited her 'Die Hexe.'\r\nHere is no traditional witch, though the broomstick on which she will\r\nride through the air is _en evidence_. She is a demoniac being, knowing\r\nher own power, and full of devilish instinct. The marble is full of life,\r\nand one seems to feel the warmth of her delicate, powerfully chiselled,\r\nthough soft and pliable limbs.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Die Unbesiegbaren' is a most powerful work, and stood out in the midst\r\nof the sculpture at Paris in 1900 with the prominence imparted by unusual\r\npower in the perception of the _whole_ of a subject and the skill to\r\nrender the perception so that others realize its full meaning. There are\r\nfour figures in this group--men drawing a heavy freight boat along the\r\nshore by means of a towline passed round their bodies, on which they\r\nthrow their weight in such a way that their legs, pressed together, lose\r\ntheir outline--except in the case of the leader--and are as a mass of\r\npower. They also pull on the line with their hands. The leader bends over\r\nthe rope until he looks down; the man behind him raises his head and\r\nlooks up with an appealing expression; the two others behind are exerting\r\nall their force in pulling on the rope, but have twisted the upper part\r\nof the body in order to look behind and watch the progress of their great\r\nburden. There is not the least resemblance of one to the other, either in\r\nfeature or expression, and to me it would seem that the woman who had\r\nconceived and executed this group might well be content to rest on her\r\nlaurels.\r\n\r\n\"But an artistic creator who is really inspired with his art and not with\r\nhimself is never satisfied; he presses on and on--sometimes after he has\r\nexpressed the best of his talent. This is not yet reached, I believe, by\r\nMiss Ries, and we shall see still greater results of her inspiration.\"\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Government commissioned this artist to execute the figure of\r\na saint. One may well prophesy that there will be nothing conventional in\r\nthis work. She has already produced a striking \"Saint Barbara.\" Her\r\nportrait busts include those of Professor Wegr, Professor Hellmer, Mark\r\nTwain, Countess Kinsky, Countess Palffs, Baron Berger, and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RIJUTINE, ELISA.</b> A bronze and a gold medal at the Beatrice\r\nExposition, Florence, 1890. Born in Florence, where she resides and\r\ndevotes herself to painting in imitation of old tapestries. An excellent\r\nexample of her work is in water-colors and is called \"The Gardener's\r\nChildren.\" In 1888 and 1889 she exhibited \"The Coronation of Esther\" and\r\na picture of \"Oleanders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ROBERTS, ELIZABETH WENTWORTH.</b>\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ROBINSON, MRS. IMOGENE MORRELL.</b> Medals at the Mechanics' Fair,\r\nBoston, and at the Centennial Exhibition, Philadelphia, 1876. Born in\r\nAttleborough, Massachusetts. Pupil of Camphausen in Düsseldorf, and of\r\nCouture in Paris, where she resided several years. Among her important\r\nworks are \"The First Battle between the Puritans and Indians\" and\r\n\"Washington and His Staff Welcoming a Provision Train,\" both at\r\nPhiladelphia. Mrs. Morrell continued to sign her pictures with her maiden\r\nname, Imogene Robinson.\r\n\r\nA critic of the New York _Evening Post_ said of her pictures at\r\nPhiladelphia: \"In the painting of the horses Mrs. Morrell has shown great\r\nknowledge of their action, and their finish is superb. The work is\r\npainted with great strength throughout, and its solidity and forcible\r\ntreatment will be admired by all who take an interest in Revolutionary\r\nhistory.... In the drawing of the figures of Standish and the chief at\r\nhis side, and the dead and dying savages, there is a fine display of\r\nartistic power, and the grouping of the figures is masterly.... In color\r\nthe works are exceedingly brilliant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ROBUSTI, MARIETTA.</b> Born in Venice. 1560-1590. The parentage of this\r\nartist would seem to promise her talent and insure its culture. She was\r\nthe daughter of Jacopo Robusti, better known as \"Il Tintoretto,\" who has\r\nbeen called \"the thunder of art,\" and who avowed his ambition to equal\r\n\"the drawing of Michael Angelo and the coloring of Titian.\"\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Marietta Robusti proves her to have been justly\r\ncelebrated for her beauty. Her face is sweet and gentle in expression.\r\nShe was sprightly in manner and full of enthusiasm for anything that\r\ninterested and attracted her; she had a good talent for music and a\r\ncharming voice in singing.\r\n\r\nHer father's fondness for her made him desire her constant companionship,\r\nand at times he permitted her to dress as a boy and share with him\r\ncertain studies that she could only have made in this disguise.\r\nTintoretto carefully cultivated the talents of his daughter, and some of\r\nthe portraits she painted did her honor. That of Marco dei Vescovi first\r\nturned public attention to her artistic merits. The beard was especially\r\npraised and it was even said by good judges that she equalled her father.\r\nIndeed, her works were so enthusiastically esteemed by some critics that\r\nit is difficult to make a just estimate of her as an artist, but we are\r\nassured of her exquisite taste in the arrangement of her pictures and of\r\nthe rare excellence of her coloring.\r\n\r\nIt soon became the fashion in the aristocratic circles of Venice to sit\r\nfor portraits to this fascinating artist. Her likeness of Jacopo Strada,\r\nthe antiquarian, was considered a worthy gift for the Emperor Maximilian,\r\nand a portrait of Marietta was hung in the chamber of his Majesty.\r\nMaximilian, Philip II. of Spain, and the Archduke Ferdinand, each in\r\nturn invited Marietta to be the painter of his Court.\r\n\r\nTintoretto could not be induced to be separated from his daughter, and\r\nthe honors she received so alarmed him that he hastened to marry her to\r\nMario Augusti, a wealthy German jeweller, upon the condition that she\r\nshould remain at home.\r\n\r\nBut the Monarch who asks no consent and heeds no refusal claimed this\r\ndaughter so beloved. She died at thirty, and it is recorded that both her\r\nfather and her husband mourned for her so long as they lived. Marietta\r\nwas buried in the Church of Santa Maria dell' Orto, where, within sight\r\nof her tomb, are several of her father's pictures.\r\n\r\nTintoretto painting his daughter's portrait after her death has been the\r\nsubject of pictures by artists of various countries, and has lost nothing\r\nof its poetic and pathetic interest in the three centuries and more that\r\nhave elapsed since that day when the brave old artist painted the\r\nlikeness of all that remained to him of his idolized child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ROCCHI, LINDA.</b> Born in Florence; she resides in Geneva. Two of her\r\nflower pieces, in water-color, were seen at the Fine Arts Exposition,\r\nMilan, 1881. In 1883, also in Milan, she exhibited \"A Wedding Garland,\"\r\n\"Hawthorne,\" etc. The constantly increasing brilliancy of her work was\r\nshown in three pictures, flowers in water-colors, seen at the Milan\r\nExposition, 1886. To Vienna, 1887, she sent four pictures of wild\r\nflowers, which were much admired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ROCCO, LILI ROSALIA.</b> Honorable mention, a bronze medal, and four\r\nsilver medals were accorded this artist at the Institute of Fine Arts in\r\nNaples, where she studied from 1880 to 1886, and was also a pupil of\r\nSolari. Born in Mazzara del Vallo, Sicily, 1863. In 1886 she exhibited,\r\nat Naples, \"Cari Fiori!\" at Palermo, \"Flora\"; and in Rome, \"A Sicilian\r\nContadina.\" In 1888 her picture, \"Spring,\" was exhibited in London. Two\r\nof her works were in the Simonetti Exposition, 1889, one being a marine\r\nview from her birthplace. She has painted many portraits, both in oils\r\nand water-colors, and has been appointed a teacher in at least two\r\nGovernment schools in Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RODIANA, ONORATA.</b> Was a contemporary of the saintly Caterina de\r\nVigri, but was of quite another order of women. She had one quality\r\nwhich, if not always attractive, at least commands attention. She was\r\nunique, since we know of no other woman who was at the same time a\r\nsuccessful artist and a valiant soldier!\r\n\r\nBorn in Castelleone, near Cremona, early in the fifteenth century, she\r\nwas known as a reputable artist while still young, and was commissioned\r\nto decorate the palace of the tyrant, Gabrino Fondolo, at Cremona. The\r\ngirlish painter was beautiful in person, frank and engaging in manner,\r\nand most attractive to the gentlemen of the tyrant's court.\r\n\r\nOne day when alone and absorbed in the execution of a wall-painting, a\r\ndissolute young noble addressed her with insulting freedom. She could not\r\nescape, and in the struggle which ensued she drew a dagger and stabbed\r\nher assailant to the heart.\r\n\r\nRushing from the palace, she disguised herself in male attire and fled to\r\nthe mountains, where she joined a company of Condottieri. She soon became\r\nso good a soldier that she was made an officer of the band.\r\n\r\nFondolo raged as tyrants are wont to do, both on account of the murder\r\nand of the escape. He vowed the direst vengeance on Onorata if ever she\r\nwere again in his power. Later, when his anger had cooled and he had no\r\nother artist at command who could worthily complete her decorations, he\r\npublished her pardon and summoned her to return to his service.\r\n\r\nOnorata completed her work, but her new vocation held her with a potent\r\nspell, and henceforth she led a divided life--never entirely\r\nrelinquishing her brush, and remaining always a soldier.\r\n\r\nWhen Castelleone was besieged by the Venetians, Onorata led her band\r\nthither and was victorious in the defence of her birthplace. She was\r\nfatally wounded in this action and died soon after, in the midst of the\r\nmen and women whose homes she had saved. They loved her for her bravery\r\nand deeply mourned the sacrifice of her life.\r\n\r\nFew stories from real life are so interesting and romantic as this, yet\r\nlittle notice has been taken of Onorata's talent or of her prowess, while\r\nmany less spirited and unusual lives have been commemorated in prose and\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RODRIGUEZ DE TORO, LUISA.</b> Honorable mention, Madrid, 1856, for a\r\npicture of \"Queen Isabel the Catholic Reading with Doña Beatriz de\r\nGalindo\"; honorable mention, 1860, for her \"Boabdil Returning from\r\nPrison.\"\r\n\r\nBorn in Madrid; a descendant of the Counts of Los Villares, and wife of\r\nthe Count of Mirasol. Pupil of Cárlos Ribera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RONNER, MME. HENRIETTE.</b> Medals and honorable mentions and elections\r\nto academies have been showered on Mme. Ronner all over Europe. The King\r\nof Belgium decorated her with the Cross of the Order of Leopold. Born in\r\nAmsterdam in 1821. The grandfather of this artist was Nicolas Frederick\r\nKnip, a flower painter; her father, Josephus Augustus Knip, a landscape\r\npainter, went blind, and after this misfortune was the teacher of his\r\ndaughter; her aunt, for whom she was named, received medals in Paris and\r\nAmsterdam for her flower pictures. What could Henriette Knip do except\r\npaint pictures? Hers was a clear case of predestination!\r\n\r\nAt all events, almost from babyhood she occupied herself with her pencil,\r\nand when she was twelve years old her blind father began to teach her.\r\nEven at six years of age it was plainly seen that she would be a painter\r\nof animals. When sixteen she exhibited a \"Cat in a Window,\" and from that\r\ntime was considered a reputable artist.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 she was married and settled in Brussels. From this time for\r\nfifteen years she painted dogs almost without exception. Her picture\r\ncalled \"Friend of Man\" was exhibited in 1850. It is her most famous work\r\nand represents an old sand-seller, whose dog, still harnessed to the\r\nlittle sand-wagon, is dying, while two other dogs are looking on with\r\nwell-defined sympathy. It is a most pathetic scene, wonderfully\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\nAbout 1870 she devoted herself to pictures of cats, in which specialty of\r\nart she has been most important. In 1876, however, she sent to the\r\nPhiladelphia Exposition a picture of \"Setter Dogs.\" \"A Cart Drawn by\r\nDogs\" is in the Museum at Hanover; \"Dog and Pigeon,\" in the Stettin\r\nMuseum; \"Coming from Market\" is in a private collection in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nMme. Ronner has invented a method of posing cats that is ingenious and of\r\ngreat advantage. To the uninitiated it would seem that one could only\r\ntake the portrait of a sleeping cat, so untiring are the little beasts in\r\ntheir gymnastic performances. But Mme. Ronner, having studied them with\r\ninfinite patience, proceeded to arrange a glass box, in which, on a\r\ncomfortable cushion, she persuades her cats to assume the positions she\r\ndesires. This box is enclosed in a wire cage, and from the top of this\r\nshe hangs some cat attraction, upon which the creature bounds and shows\r\nthose wonderful antics that the artist has so marvellously reproduced in\r\nher painting. Mme. Ronner has two favorite models, \"Jem\" and \"Monmouth.\"\r\nThe last name is classical, since the cat of Mother Michel has been made\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\nMiss Winslow, in \"Concerning Cats,\" says that \"Mme. Ronner excels all\r\nother cat painters, living or dead. She not only infuses a wonderful\r\ndegree of life into her little figures, but reproduces the shades of\r\nexpression, shifting and variable as the sands of the sea, as no other\r\nartist of the brush has done. Asleep or awake, her cats look to the\"\r\nfelinarian \"like cats with whom he or she is familiar. Curiosity,\r\ndrowsiness, indifference, alertness, love, hate, anxiety, temper,\r\ninnocence, cunning, fear, confidence, mischief, earnestness, dignity,\r\nhelplessness--they are all in Mme. Ronner's cats' faces, just as we see\r\nthem in our own cats.\"\r\n\r\nIt is but a short time ago that Mme. Ronner was still painting in\r\nBrussels, and had not only cats, but a splendid black dog and a cockatoo\r\nto bear her company, while her son is devoted to her. Her house is large\r\nand her grounds pleasant, and her fourscore years did not prevent her\r\npainting several hours a day, and, like some other ladies of whom we\r\nknow, she was \"eighty years young.\"\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Magazine of Art_, M. H. Spielman, in an article on the\r\nRoyal Academy Exhibition, 1903, writes: \"What the dog is to Mr. Riviere,\r\nto Madame Ronner is the cat. With what unerring truth she records\r\ndelightful kittenly nature, the feline nobility of haughty indifference\r\nto human approval or discontent, the subtlety of expression, and drawing\r\nof heads and bodies, the exact quality and tone of the fur, the\r\nexpressive eloquence of the tail! With all her eighty years, Madame\r\nRonner's hand, vision, and sensibility have not diminished; only her\r\nsobriety of color seems to have increased.\" Her pictures of this year\r\nwere called \"The Ladybird\" and \"Coaxing.\" To the Exhibition of the\r\nBeaux-Arts in Brussels, 1903, Mme. Ronner sent pictures of cats, full of\r\nlife and mischief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ROOSENBOOM, MARGARITE VOGEL.</b> Second-class medal, Munich, 1892. Born\r\nin 1843 and died in 1896, near The Hague. She spent a large part of her\r\nlife near Utrecht, devoting herself mainly to the painting of flowers.\r\nOne of her works is in the Royal Museum at Amsterdam, and another in the\r\nMuseum at Breslau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ROPE, ELLEN M.</b> This English sculptor executed four large panels for\r\nthe Women's Building at the Chicago Exhibition. They represented Faith,\r\nHope, Charity, and Heavenly Wisdom. They are now in the Ladies' Dwelling,\r\nCherries Street, London. A \"Memorial\" by her is in Salisbury Cathedral.\r\nHer reliefs of children are, however, her best works; that of a \"Boy on a\r\nDolphin\" is most attractive. \"Christ Blessing Little Children\" is\r\ncharmingly rendered.\r\n\r\nAt the Academy, 1903, she exhibited a panel for an organ chamber, in low\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ROSA, ANIELLA DI.</b> 1613-1649. A pupil in Naples of Stanzioni, who, by\r\nreason of her violent death, has been called the Neapolitan Sirani. She\r\nacquired a good reputation as a historical painter and doubtless had\r\nunusual talent, but as she worked in conjunction with Stanzioni and with\r\nher husband, Agostino Beltrano, it is difficult to speak of works\r\nentirely her own.\r\n\r\nTwo pictures that were acknowledged to be hers represented the birth and\r\ndeath of the Virgin; these were praised and were at one time in a church\r\nin Naples, but in a recent search for them I was unable to satisfy myself\r\nthat the pictures I saw were genuine.\r\n\r\nAnother pupil in the studio of Stanzioni was the Beltrano whom Aniella\r\nmarried. He painted in fresco, Aniella in oils, and they were frequently\r\nemployed together. The fine picture of San Biagio, in the church of Santa\r\nMaria della Sanità, was one of their joint works.\r\n\r\nTheir early married life was very happy, but Aniella was beautiful and\r\nBeltrano grew jealous; it is said without cause, through the influence of\r\na woman who loved him and hated Aniella; and in spite of the efforts she\r\nmade to merit her husband's confidence, his distrust of her increased.\r\nHer base rival, by her art and falsehood, finally succeeded in convincing\r\nBeltrano that Aniella was unworthy, and in his rage he fatally stabbed\r\nher, when, at thirty-six, she was in the prime of her beauty and talent.\r\nShe survived long enough to convince her husband of her innocence and to\r\npardon him for his crime, but he fled from Italy and lived the life of an\r\noutcast during ten years. He then returned to Naples, where after seven\r\nyears, tormented by remorse, death came to his release.\r\n\r\nDomenici generously praised the works of Aniella, and quoted her master,\r\nStanzioni, as saying that she was the equal of the best painters of her\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ROSALBA.</b> See Carriera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ROSSI, PROPERZIA DE.</b> Born in Bologna. 1490-1530. This artist was the\r\nfirst woman to succeed as a sculptor whose works can still be seen. Pupil\r\nof Raimondi, she was more or less influenced by Tribolo. In the Church of\r\nSan Petronio, in her native city, in the eleventh chapel, is a beautiful\r\nbas-relief of two angels, executed by Properzia. They are near Tribolo's\r\n\"Ascension.\" A relief and a portrait bust in the same church are also\r\nascribed to her.\r\n\r\nHer first work in sculpture was a minute representation of the\r\nCrucifixion on a peach stone! The executioners, women, soldiers, and\r\ndisciples were all represented in this infinitesimal space. She also\r\ninserted in a coat of arms a double-headed eagle in silver filigree;\r\neleven peach stones on each side, one set representing eleven apostles\r\nwith an article of the creed underneath, the other set eleven virgins\r\nwith the name of a saint and her special attribute on each. Some of these\r\nintaglios are still in a private collection in Bologna.\r\n\r\nAt length Properzia saw the folly of thus belittling her talent, and when\r\nthe facade of San Petronio was to be enriched with sculpture she asked\r\nfor a share in the work and presented a bust she had made as a pledge of\r\nher ability; she was appointed to execute a portion of the decorations.\r\nShe made a bas-relief, the subject being \"Joseph and Potiphar's Wife,\"\r\nwhich Vasari called \"a lovely picture, sculptured with womanly grace, and\r\nmore than admirable.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the jealousy of other artists was aroused, and a story was\r\ndiligently repeated to the effect that Properzia loved a young nobleman\r\nwho did not care for her, and that the above work, so much admired,\r\nrepresented her own passion. Albertini and other artists waged an\r\nabsolute crusade against her, and so influenced the superintendents of\r\nthe church that Properzia was obliged to leave the work and her relief\r\nwas never put in place. Through mortification and grief her health\r\nfailed, and she died when but forty years old.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her persecution she was known in all Italy, not only for her\r\nsculpture, but for her copper-plate engraving and etching. When Pope\r\nClement VII. went to Bologna for the coronation of Charles V. he asked\r\nfor Properzia, only to hear that she had been buried that very week.\r\n\r\nHer story has been told by Vasari and other writers. She was handsome,\r\naccomplished in music, distinguished for her knowledge of science, and\r\nwithal a good and orderly housewife. \"Well calculated to awaken the envy,\r\nnot of women only, but also of men.\" Canova ardently admired the work of\r\nProperzia that remained in his day, and esteemed her early death as one\r\nof the chief misfortunes to the advance of the fine arts in Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ROTKY, BARONESS HANNA.</b> Born at Czernowitz in 1857. She studied\r\nportrait painting under Blaas, Swerdts, and Trentino, and has worked\r\nprincipally in Vienna. Her portrait of Freiherr von Sterneck is in the\r\nMilitary Academy at Wiener-Neustadt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RUDDER, MME. DE.</b> This lady has made an art of her embroidery, and\r\nmay be said to have revived this decorative specialty and to have\r\nequalled the ancient productions which are so beautiful and valuable.\r\nAfter her marriage to the well-known sculptor this gifted couple began\r\ntheir collaboration. M. P. Verneuil, in _Brush and Pencil_, November,\r\n1903, writes: \"The first result of this joint work was shown in 1894 at\r\nthe Exposition Cercle pour l'Art, in the form of a panel, called 'The\r\nEagle and the Swan.' It was exhibited afterward at the Secession in\r\nVienna, where it was purchased by a well-known amateur and connoisseur.\r\nOther works were produced in succession, each more interesting than its\r\npredecessor. Not daunted by difficulties that would have discouraged the\r\nmost ambitious and audacious craftswoman, Mme. de Rudder took for a\r\nsubject 'The Fates,' to decorate a screen. Aside from the artistic\r\ninterest attaching to this work, it is remarkable for another quality.\r\nThe artist yielded to the instinctive liking that she had for useful\r\nart--she ornamented a useful article--and in mastering the technical\r\ndifficulties of her work she created the new method called\r\n're-embroidery.' For the dresses of her 'Fates' ancient silks were\r\nutilized for a background. Some of the pieces had moth-holes, which\r\nnecessitated the addition of 'supplementary ornamental motives,'\r\n'embroidered on cloth to conceal the defects.' The discovery of\r\n're-embroidery' was the result of this enforced expedient.\r\n\r\n\"This screen, finished in 1896, was exhibited at the Cercle Artistique,\r\nBrussels, where the mayor, M. Buls, saw it. Realizing the possibilities\r\nof the method and the skill of the artist, he gave an order to Mme. de\r\nRudder to decorate the Marriage Hall of the Hotel de Ville. This order\r\nwas delivered in 1896. During this period Mme. de Rudder worked\r\nfeverishly. About the same time that the order for the Hotel de Ville was\r\ngiven, she received from M. Van Yssendyck, architect of the Hotel\r\nProvincial in Ghent, a commission to design and embroider six large\r\nallegorical panels. One of them represented 'Wisdom' in the habiliments\r\nof Minerva, modernized, holding an olive branch. The five others were\r\n'Justice,' holding a thistle, symbolizing law; 'Eloquence,' crowned with\r\nroses and holding a lyre; 'Strength,' bending an oak branch; 'Truth,'\r\ncrushing a serpent and bearing a mirror and some lilies; and 'Prudence,'\r\nwith the horn of plenty and some holly. These six panels are remarkable\r\nfor the beautiful decorative feeling that suffuses their composition. The\r\ntricks of workmanship are varied, and all combine to give a wonderful\r\neffect. Contrary to the form of presenting the 'Fates,' all the figures\r\nare draped.\"\r\n\r\nHer next important commission was for eight large panels, intended to\r\ndecorate the Congo Free State department in the Brussels Exposition.\r\nThese panels represent the \"Triumph of Civilization over Barbarism,\" and\r\nare now in the Museum at Tervueren. They are curious in their symbols of\r\nfetichism, and have an attraction that one can scarcely explain. The\r\nabove are but a part of her important works, and naturally, when not\r\nabsorbed by these, Mme. de Rudder executes some smaller pieces which are\r\nmarvels of patience in their exquisite detail.\r\n\r\nPerhaps her panels of the \"Four Seasons\" may be called her\r\n_chef-d'oeuvre_. The writer quoted above also says:\r\n\r\n\"To Mme. de Rudder must be given the credit for the interpretation of\r\nwork demanding large and varied decorative effect, while in the creation\r\nof true artistic composition she easily stands at the head of the limited\r\ncoterie of men and women who have mastered this delicate and difficult\r\nart. She is a leader in her peculiar craft.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RUDE, MME. SOPHIE FRÉMIET.</b> 1797-1867. Medal at Paris Salon, 1833.\r\nBorn in Dijon. This artist painted historical and genre subjects as well\r\nas portraits. Her picture of the \"Sleeping Virgin,\" 1831, and that of\r\nthe \"Arrest of the Duchess of Burgundy in Bruges,\" 1841, are in the\r\nDijon Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RUYSCH, RACHEL.</b> The perfection of flower-painting is seen in the\r\nworks of Rachel Ruysch. The daughter of a distinguished professor of\r\nanatomy, she was born at Amsterdam in 1664. She was for a time a pupil of\r\nWilliam van Aelst, but soon studied from nature alone. Some art critics\r\nesteem her works superior to those of De Heem and Van Huysum. Let that be\r\nas it may, the pictures with which she was no doubt dissatisfied when\r\nthey passed from her hand more than two centuries ago are greatly valued\r\nto-day and her genius is undisputed.\r\n\r\nWhen thirty years old Rachel Ruysch married the portrait painter, Julian\r\nvan Pool. She bore him ten children, but in the midst of all her cares\r\nshe never laid her brush aside. Her reputation extended to every court of\r\nEurope. She received many honors, and was elected to the Academical\r\nSociety at The Hague. She was received with distinguished courtesies on\r\nthe two occasions when she visited Düsseldorf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alinari, Photo.\r\n\r\nIn the Pitti Gallery, Florence\r\n\r\nFRUIT, FLOWERS, AND INSECTS\r\n\r\nRACHEL RUYSCH]\r\n\r\nThe Elector John of Pfalz appointed her painter at his court, and beyond\r\npaying her generously for her pictures, bestowed valuable gifts on her.\r\nThe Elector sent several of her works to the Grand Duke of Tuscany and to\r\nother distinguished rulers of that day.\r\n\r\nThe advance of years in no wise dulled her powers. Her pictures painted\r\nwhen eighty years old are as delicately finished as those of many years\r\nearlier. She died when eighty-six, \"respected by the great, beloved even\r\nby her rivals, praised by all who knew her.\"\r\n\r\nThe pictures by Rachel Ruysch are honorably placed in many public\r\ngalleries; in those of Florence and Turin, as well as at Amsterdam, The\r\nHague, Berlin, Dresden, Vienna, and Munich, they are much valued.\r\nAlthough these pictures are characterized by extreme delicacy of touch,\r\nsoftness, and lightness, this artist knew how so to combine these\r\nqualities as to impart an effect of strength to her painting. Her\r\nrendering of separate flowers was exquisite, and her roses, either by\r\nthemselves or combined with other flowers, are especially beautiful. She\r\npainted fruits in perfection, and the insects and butterflies which she\r\nsometimes added are admirably executed.\r\n\r\nThe chief criticism that can be made of her pictures is that she was less\r\nskilful in the grouping of her flowers than in their painting. Many of\r\nher works are in private galleries, especially in Holland. They are\r\nrarely sold; in London, about thirty years ago, a small \"Bouquet of\r\nFlowers with Insects\" was sold for more than two thousand dollars, and is\r\nnow of double that value.\r\n\r\nHer pictures have the same clearness and individuality that are seen in\r\nher portrait, in which she has short hair, a simple low-cut dress, with a\r\nnecklace of beads about the throat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SALLES, ADELHEID.</b> Born in Dresden, 1825; died in Paris, 1890. Pupil\r\nof Bernhard and Jacquand, she established her studio in Paris. Many of\r\nher works are in museums: \"Elijah in the Desert,\" at Lyons; \"The Legend\r\nof the Alyscamps,\" at Nîmes; \"The Village Maiden,\" at Grenoble; \"Field\r\nFlowers,\" at Havre, etc. She also painted portraits and historical\r\nsubjects, among which are \"Psyche in Olympus,\" \"The Daughters of\r\nJerusalem in the Babylonian Captivity,\" and the \"Daughter of Jairus.\"\r\n\r\nShe was a sister of E. Puyroche-Wagner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SARTAIN, EMILY.</b> Medal at Philadelphia Exhibition, 1876; Mary Smith\r\nprize at the Pennsylvania Academy for best painting by a woman, in 1881\r\nand 1883. Born in Philadelphia, 1841. Miss Sartain has been the principal\r\nof the Philadelphia School of Design for Women since 1886.\r\n\r\nShe studied engraving under her father, John Sartain, and with Luminais\r\nin Paris. She engraved and etched book illustrations and numerous larger\r\nprints. She is also a painter of portraits and genre pictures, and has\r\nexhibited at the Salon des Beaux-Arts, Paris. Miss Sartain has been\r\nappointed as delegate from the United States to the International\r\nCongress on Instruction in Drawing to be held at Berne next August. Her\r\nappointment was recommended by the Secretary of the Interior, the United\r\nStates Commissioner of Education, and Prof. J. H. Gore. Miss Sartain has\r\nalso received letters from Switzerland from M. Leon Genoud, president of\r\nthe Swiss Commission, begging her to accept the appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SCHAEFER, MARIA.</b> First-class medal, Bene-merenti, Roumania. Born in\r\nDresden, 1854. Her first studies were made in Darmstadt under A. Noack;\r\nlater she was a pupil of Budde and Bauer in Düsseldorf, and finally of\r\nEisenmenger in Vienna. After travelling in Italy in 1879, she settled in\r\nDarmstadt. She made several beautiful copies of Holbein's \"Madonna,\" one\r\nfor the King of Roumania, and one as a gift from the city of Darmstadt\r\nto the Czarina Alexandra. Among her most excellent portraits are those of\r\nFriedrich von Schmidt and his son Henry. Several of her religious\r\npaintings ornament German churches: \"St. Elizabeth\" is at Biedenkopf,\r\n\"Mary's Departure from the Tomb of Christ\" is at Nierstein, and \"Christ\r\nwith St. Louis and St. Elizabeth\" and a Rosary picture are in the\r\nCatholic church at Darmstadt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SCHEFFER, CAROLINE.</b> The daughter of Ary Lamme and wife of J. B.\r\nScheffer was an artist in the last decades of the eighteenth century, but\r\nthe special interest connected with her is the fact that she was the\r\nmother of Ary and Henry Scheffer. From her artistic standpoint she had an\r\nappreciation of what was needed for the benefit of her sons. She took\r\nthem to Paris to study, devoted herself entirely to their welfare, and\r\ndied in Paris in 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SCHLEH, ANNA.</b> Born in Berlin, 1833. Her principal studies were made\r\nin her native city under Schrader, although she went to Rome in 1868, and\r\nfinally took up her residence there. She had, previous to her work in\r\nRome, painted \"The Marys at the Grave.\" Her later pictures include \"The\r\nCitron-Vender\" and a number of portraits for the Henkel family of\r\nDonnersmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SCHMITT-SCHENKH, MARIA.</b> Born in Baden, 1837. She studied her art in\r\nMunich, Carlsruhe, and Italy. She established herself in Munich and\r\npainted pictures for churches, which are in Kirrlach, Mauer,\r\nZiegelhausen, and other German towns. She also designed church windows,\r\nespecially for the Liebfrauenkirche at Carlsruhe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SCHUMANN, ANNA MARIA.</b> Was called by the Dutch poets their Sappho\r\nand their Corneille. She was born in 1607, but as her family were\r\nProtestants and frequently changed their residence in order to avoid\r\npersecution, the place of her birth is unknown. When Anna Maria was eight\r\nyears old, they went permanently to Utrecht.\r\n\r\nThis distinguished woman was one of the exceptions said to prove rules,\r\nfor though a prodigy in childhood she did not become a commonplace or\r\nstupid woman. Learning was her passion and art her recreation. It is\r\ndifficult to repeat what is recorded of her unusual attainments and not\r\nfeel as if one were being misled by a Munchausen! But it would be\r\nungracious to lessen a fame almost three centuries old.\r\n\r\nWe are told that Anna Maria could speak in Latin when seven years old,\r\nand translated from Seneca at ten. She acquired the Hebrew, Greek,\r\nSamaritan, Arabic, Chaldaic, Syriac, Ethiopian, Turkish, and Persian\r\nlanguages with such thoroughness that her admirers claim that she wrote\r\nand spoke them all. She also read with ease and spoke with finished\r\nelegance Italian, Spanish, English, and French, besides German and her\r\nnative tongue.\r\n\r\nAnna Maria Schurmann wrote verses in various languages, but the chief end\r\nwhich her exhaustive studies served was to aid her in theological\r\nresearch; in this she found her greatest satisfaction and deepest\r\ninterest. She was respectfully consulted upon important questions by the\r\nscholars of different countries.\r\n\r\nAt the University of Utrecht an honorable place was reserved for her in\r\nthe lecture-rooms, and she frequently took part in the learned\r\ndiscussions there. The professors of the University of Leyden paid her\r\nthe compliment of erecting a tribune where she could hear all that passed\r\nin the lecture-room without being seen by the audience.\r\n\r\nAs an artist the Schurmann reached such excellence that the painter\r\nHonthorst valued a portrait by her at a thousand Dutch florins--about\r\nfour hundred and thirty dollars--an enormous sum when we remember that\r\nthe works of her contemporary, Albert Cuyp, were sold for thirty florins!\r\nand no higher price was paid for his works before the middle of the\r\neighteenth century. A few years ago his picture, called \"Morning Light,\"\r\nwas sold at a public sale in London for twenty-five thousand dollars. How\r\nastonishing that a celebrated artist like Honthorst, who painted in\r\nUtrecht when Cuyp painted in Dort, should have valued a portrait by Anna\r\nMaria Schurmann at the price of thirty-three works by Cuyp! Such facts as\r\nthese suggest a question regarding the relative value of the works of\r\nmore modern artists. Will the judgments of the present be thus reversed\r\nin the future?\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary woman filled the measure of possibilities by carving\r\nin wood and ivory, engraving on crystal and copper, and having a fine\r\nmusical talent, playing on several instruments. When it is added that she\r\nwas of a lovable nature and attractive in manner, one is not surprised\r\nthat her contemporaries called her \"the wonder of creation.\"\r\n\r\nVolsius was her friend and taught her Hebrew. She was intimately\r\nassociated with such scholars as Salmatius and Heinsius, and was in\r\ncorrespondence with scholars, philosophers, and theologians regarding\r\nimportant questions of her time.\r\n\r\nAnna Maria Schurmann was singularly free from egotism. She rarely\r\nconsented to publish her writings, though often urged to do so. She\r\navoided publicity and refused complimentary attentions which were urged\r\nupon her, conducting herself with a modesty as rare as her endowments.\r\n\r\nIn 1664, when travelling with her brother, she became acquainted with\r\nLabadie, the celebrated French enthusiast who preached new doctrines. He\r\nhad many disciples called Labadists. He taught that God used deceit with\r\nman when He judged it well for man to be deceived; that contemplation led\r\nto perfection; that self-mortification, self-denial, and prayer were\r\nnecessary to a godly life; and that the Holy Spirit constantly made new\r\nrevelations to the human beings prepared to receive them.\r\n\r\nAnna Maria Schurmann heard these doctrines when prostrated by a double\r\nsorrow, the deaths of her father and brother. She put aside all other\r\ninterests and devoted herself to those of the Labadists. It is said that\r\nafter the death of Labadie she gathered his disciples together and\r\nconducted them to Vivert, in Friesland. William Penn saw her there, and\r\nin his account of the meeting he tells how much he was impressed by her\r\ngrave solemnity and vigorous intellect.\r\n\r\nFrom this time she devoted her fortune to charity and died in poverty at\r\nthe age of seventy-one. Besides her fame as an artist and a scholar, her\r\nname was renowned for purity of heart and fervent religious feeling. Her\r\nvirtues were many and her few faults were such as could not belong to an\r\nignoble nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SCUDDER, JANET.</b> Medal at Columbian Exposition, 1893. Two of her\r\nmedallion portraits are in the Luxembourg, Paris. Member of the National\r\nSculpture Society, New York. Born in Terre Haute, Indiana. Pupil of\r\nRebisso in Cincinnati, of Lorado Taft in Chicago, and of Frederic\r\nMacMonnies in Paris.\r\n\r\nAt the Chicago Exposition Miss Scudder exhibited two heroic-sized statues\r\nrepresenting Illinois and Indiana. The portraits purchased by the French\r\nGovernment are of American women and are the first work of an American\r\nwoman sculptor to be admitted to the Luxembourg. These medallions are in\r\nbas-relief in marble, framed in bronze. Casts from them have been made in\r\ngold and silver. The first is said to be the largest medallion ever made\r\nin gold; it is about four inches long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FROG FOUNTAIN\r\n\r\nJANET SCUDDER]\r\n\r\nTo the Pan-American Exposition Miss Scudder contributed four boys\r\nstanding on a snail, which made a part of the \"Fountain of Abundance.\"\r\nShe has exhibited in New York and Philadelphia a fountain, representing a\r\nboy dancing hilariously and snapping his fingers at four huge frogs round\r\nhis pedestal. The water spurts from the mouths of the frogs and covers\r\nthe naked child.\r\n\r\nMiss Scudder is commissioned to make a portrait statue of heroic size for\r\nthe St. Louis Exposition. She will no doubt exhibit smaller works there.\r\nPortraits are her specialty, and in these she has made a success, as is\r\nproved by the appreciation of her work in Paris.\r\n\r\nA memorial figure in marble is in Woodlawn Cemetery, also a cinerary urn\r\nin stone and bronze; a bronze memorial tablet is in Union College. Miss\r\nScudder also made the seal for the Bar Association of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SEARS, SARAH C.</b> Medal at Chicago, 1893; William Evans prize,\r\nAmerican Water-Color Society, New York; honorable mention, Paris\r\nExposition, 1900; bronze medal at Buffalo, 1901; silver medal at\r\nCharleston, South Carolina. Member of the New York Water-Color Club,\r\nBoston Art Students' Association, National Arts Club, Boston Water-Color\r\nClub. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Pupil of Ross Turner, Joseph de\r\nCamp, Edmund C. Tarbell, and George de Forest Brush. Mrs. Sears has also\r\nstudied by herself with the criticism of masters.\r\n\r\nShe paints portraits, figures, and flowers, and is much interested in the\r\napplied arts. Of her exhibition at the Boston Art Club, 1903, a critic\r\nwrites: \"Nothing could be more brilliant in point of color than the group\r\nof seven water-color pictures of a sunny flower-garden by Mrs. Sears. In\r\nthese works pure and limpid color has been pushed to its extreme\r\ncapacity, under full daylight conditions, with a splendor of brightness\r\nwhich never crosses the line of crudity, but holds the same relative\r\nvalues as we see in nature, the utmost force of local color courageously\r\nset forth and contrasted without apparent artifice, blending into an\r\nharmonious unity of tone. Two of these pictures are especially fine, with\r\ntheir cool backgrounds of sombre pines to set off the magnificent masses\r\nof flowers in the foreground.\"\r\n\r\nAt the exhibition of the Philadelphia Water-Color Club, 1903, the _Press_\r\nsaid: \"These brilliant and overpowering combinations of color carry to\r\na limit not before reached the decorative possibilities of flowers.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Sears' honors have been awarded to her portraits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SEIDLER, CAROLINE LUISE.</b> Born in Jena, 1786; died in Weimar, 1866.\r\nHer early studies were made in Gotha with Doell; in 1811 she went to\r\nDresden, where she became a pupil of G. von Kügelgen; in 1817 Langer\r\nreceived her into his Munich studio; and between 1818 and 1823 she was in\r\nItaly, making special studies of Vanucci and Raphael. In 1823 she was\r\nappointed instructor of the royal princesses at Weimar, and in 1824\r\ninspector of the gallery there, and later became court painter. Among her\r\nworks are a portrait of Goethe, a picture of \"Ulysses and the Sirens,\"\r\nand one of \"Christ, the Compassionate,\" which is in the church at\r\nSchestadt, Holstein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SERRANO Y BARTOLOMÉ, JOAQUINA.</b> Born in Fermoselle. Pupil in Madrid\r\nof Juan Espalter, of the School of Arts and Crafts, and of the School of\r\nPainting. She sent four pictures to the Exposition of 1876 in Madrid: the\r\nportrait of a young woman, a still-life subject, a bunch of grapes, and a\r\n\"Peasant Girl\"--the last two are in the Museum of Murcia. In 1878 she\r\nsent \"A Kitchen Maid on Saturday,\" a study, a flower piece, and two\r\nstill-life pictures; and in 1881 two portraits and some landscapes. Her\r\nportrait of the painter Fortuny, which belongs to the Society of Authors\r\nand Artists, gained her a membership in that Society. Two other excellent\r\nportraits are those of her teacher, Espalter, and General Trillo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SEWELL, AMANDA BREWSTER.</b> Bronze medal, Chicago, 1893; bronze medal,\r\nBuffalo, 1901; silver medal, Charleston; Clarke prize, Academy of\r\nDesign, 1903. Member of the Woman's Art Club and an associate of National\r\nAcademy of Design. Born in Northern New York. Pupil at Cooper Union under\r\nDouglas Volk and R. Swain Gifford, and of Art Students' League under\r\nWilliam Chase and William Sartain; also of Julian's Academy under Tony\r\nRobert Fleury and Bouguereau, and of Carolus Duran.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sewell's \"A Village Incident\" is owned by the Philadelphia Social\r\nArt Club; \"Where Roses Bloom\" is in the Boston Art Club; portrait of\r\nProfessor William R. Ware is in the Library of Columbia University. Her\r\nportrait of Amalia Küssner will be exhibited and published.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sewell is the first woman to take the Clarke prize. She has been a\r\ncareful student in the arrangement of portraits in order to make\r\nattractive pictures as well as satisfactory likenesses. Of the pictures\r\nshe exhibited at the Academy of Design, winter of 1903, Charles H. Caffin\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n\"The portrait of Mrs. Charles S. Dodge, by Mrs. A. Brewster Sewell, is\r\nthe finest example in the exhibition of pictorial treatment, the lady\r\nbeing wrapped in a brown velvet cloak with broad edges of brown fur, and\r\nseated before a background of dark foliage. It is a most distinguished\r\ncanvas, though one may object to the too obvious affectation of the\r\narrangement of the hands and of the gesture of the head--features which\r\nwill jar upon many eyes and detract from the general handsomeness. The\r\nsame lady sends a large classical subject, the 'Sacred Hecatomb,' to\r\nwhich the Clarke prize was awarded. It represents a forest scene lit by\r\nslanting sunlight, through which winds a string of bulls, the foremost\r\naccompanied by a band of youths and maidens with dance and song. The\r\nlight effects are managed very skilfully and with convincing truth, and\r\nthe figures are free and animated in movement, though the flesh tints are\r\nscarcely agreeable. It is a decorative composition that might be fitly\r\nplaced in a large hall in some country house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SEYDELMANN, APOLLONIE.</b> Member of the Dresden Academy. Born at\r\nTrieste about 1768; died in Dresden, 1840. Pupil of J. C. Seydelmann,\r\nwhom she married. Later she went to Italy and there studied miniature\r\npainting under Madame Maron.\r\n\r\nShe is best known for her excellent copies of old pictures, and\r\nespecially by her copy of the Sistine Madonna, from which Müller's\r\nengraving was made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SHAW, ANNIE C.</b> The first woman elected Academician in the Academy of\r\nDesign, Chicago, 1876. Born at Troy, New York. Pupil of H. C. Ford.\r\nLandscape painter. Among her works are \"On the Calumet,\" \"Willow Island,\"\r\n\"Keene Valley, New York,\" \"Returning from the Fair,\" 1878, which was\r\nexhibited in Chicago, New York, and Boston. To the Centennial,\r\nPhiladelphia, 1876, she sent her \"Illinois Prairie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Returning from the Fair\" shows a group of Alderney cattle in a road\r\ncurving through a forest. At the time of its exhibition an art critic\r\nwrote: \"The eye of the spectator is struck with the rich mass of foliage,\r\npassing from the light green of the birches in the foreground, where the\r\nlight breaks through, to the dark green of the dense forest, shading into\r\nthe brownish tints of the early September-tinged leaves. Farther on, the\r\neye is carried back through a beautiful vista formed by the road leading\r\nthrough the centre of the picture, giving a fine perspective and distance\r\nthrough a leafy archway of elms and other forest trees that gracefully\r\nmingle their branches overhead, through which one catches a glimpse of\r\ndeep blue sky. As the eye follows this roadway to its distant part the\r\nsun lights up the sky, tingeing with a mellow light the group of small\r\ntrees and willows, contrasting beautifully with the almost sombre tones\r\nof the dense forest in the middle distance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SHRIMPTON, ADA M.</b> Has exhibited at the Royal Academy, Royal\r\nInstitute of Water-Colors, British Artists, and principal provincial\r\ngalleries in England and in Australia; also at the Paris Salon. Member of\r\nSociety of Women Artists, London. Born in Old Alresford, Hampshire. Pupil\r\nof John Sparkes at South Kensington, and of Jean Paul Laurens and\r\nBenjamin Constant in Paris.\r\n\r\nThis artist has painted principally figure subjects, among which are\r\n\"Cedric's Daughter,\" \"Thoughts of Youth are Long Thoughts,\" \"Dream of the\r\nPast,\" \"Pippa Passes,\" \"Dorothy's Bridesmaid's Dress,\" etc., etc.\r\nRecently she has devoted herself to portraits of ladies and children, in\r\nboth oil and water-colors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SIRANI, ELISABETTA.</b> Has been praised as a woman and as an artist by\r\nLanzi, Malvasia, Picinardi, and other writers until one must believe that\r\nin spite of the exaggeration of her personal qualities and her artistic\r\ngenius, she was a singularly admirable woman and a gifted artist.\r\n\r\nShe was born in Bologna about 1640, and, like Artemisia Gentileschi, was\r\nthe daughter of a painter of the school of Guido Reni, whose follower\r\nElisabetta also became. From the study of her master she seems to have\r\nacquired the power to perceive and reproduce the greatest possible beauty\r\nwith which her subjects could be invested.\r\n\r\nShe worked with such rapidity that she was accused of profiting by her\r\nfather's assistance, and in order to refute this accusation it was\r\narranged that the Duchess of Brunswick, the Duchess of Mirandola, Duke\r\nCosimo, and others should meet in her studio, on which occasion\r\nElisabetta charmed and astonished her guests by the ease and perfection\r\nwith which she sketched in and shaded drawings of the subjects which one\r\nperson after another suggested to her.\r\n\r\nHer large picture of the \"Baptism of Christ\" was completed when the\r\nartist was but twenty years old. Malvasia gives a list of one hundred and\r\ntwenty pictures executed by Elisabetta, and yet she was but twenty-five\r\nwhen her mysterious death occurred.\r\n\r\nIn the Pinacoteca of Bologna is the \"St. Anthony Adoring the Virgin and\r\nInfant Jesus,\" by the Sirani, which is much admired; several other works\r\nof hers are in her native city. \"The Death of Abel\" is in the Gallery of\r\nTurin; the \"Charity,\" in the Sciarra Palace in Rome; \"Cupids\" and a\r\npicture of \"Martha and Mary,\" in the Vienna Gallery; an \"Infant Jesus\"\r\nand a picture called \"A Subject after Guido\" are in the Hermitage at\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nHer composition was graceful and refined, her drawing good, her color\r\nfresh and sweet, with a resemblance to Guido Reni in the half tones. She\r\nwas especially happy in the heads of the Madonna and the Magdalene,\r\nimparting to them an expression of exalted tenderness.\r\n\r\nHer paintings on copper and her etchings were most attractive; indeed,\r\nall her works revealed the innate grace and refinement of her nature.\r\n\r\nAside from her art the Sirani was a most interesting woman. She was very\r\nbeautiful in person, and the sweetness of her temper made her a favorite\r\nwith her friends, while her charming voice and fine musical talent added\r\nto her many attractions. Her admirers have also commended her taste in\r\ndress, which was very simple, and have even praised her moderation in\r\neating! She was skilled in domestic matters and accustomed to rise at\r\ndawn to attend to her household affairs, not permitting her art to\r\ninterfere with the more homely duties of her life. One writer says that\r\n\"her devoted filial affection, her feminine grace, and the artless\r\nbenignity of her manners rounded out a character regarded as an ideal of\r\nperfection by her friends.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be that her tragic fate caused an exaggerated estimate to be made\r\nof her both as a woman and an artist. The actual cause of her death is\r\nunknown. There have been many theories concerning it. It was very\r\ngenerally believed that she was poisoned, although neither the reason for\r\nthe crime nor the name of its perpetrator was known.\r\n\r\nBy some she was believed to have been sacrificed to the same professional\r\njealousy that destroyed Domenichino; others accepted the theory that a\r\nprincely lover who had made unworthy proposals to her, which she had\r\nscorned, had revenged himself by her murder. At length a servant, Lucia\r\nTolomelli, who had been a long time in the Sirani family, was suspected\r\nof having poisoned her young mistress, was arrested, tried, and banished.\r\nBut after a time the father of Elisabetta, finding no convincing reason\r\nto believe her guilty, obtained her pardon.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the cause of the artist's death, the effect upon\r\nher native city was overwhelming and the day of her burial was one of\r\ngeneral mourning, the ceremony being attended with great pomp. She was\r\nburied beside Guido Reni, in the Chapel of Our Lady of the Rosary, in the\r\nmagnificent Church of the Dominicans.\r\n\r\nPoets and orators vied with each other in sounding her praises, and a\r\nbook called \"Il Penello Lagrimato,\" published at Bologna soon after her\r\ndeath, is a collection of orations, sonnets, odes, epitaphs, and\r\nanagrams, in Latin and Italian, setting forth the love which her native\r\ncity bore to this beautiful woman, and rehearsing again and again her\r\ncharms and her virtues.\r\n\r\nIn the Ercolani Gallery there is a picture of Elisabetta painting a\r\nportrait of her father. It is said that she also painted a portrait of\r\nherself looking up with a spiritual expression, which is in a private\r\ncollection and seen by few people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SMITH, JESSIE WILLCOX.</b> Mary Smith prize, Pennsylvania Academy of\r\nFine Arts, 1903. Member of the Plastic Club and a fellow of the Academy,\r\nPhiladelphia. Born in Philadelphia, where she was a pupil of the Academy;\r\nalso studied under Thomas Eakins, Thomas P. Anschutz, and Howard Pyle.\r\n\r\nMiss Smith is essentially an illustrator and her work is seen in all the\r\nleading American magazines. \"The Child's Calendar\" is the work of this\r\nartist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SONREL, MLLE. E.</b> Honorable mention, Paris, 1893; third-class medal,\r\n1895; bronze medal, Paris Exposition, 1900. At the Salon des Artistes\r\nFrançais, 1902, she exhibited \"Sybille\" and \"Monica\"; in 1903, \"The Dance\r\nof Terpsichore\" and \"Princesse Lointaine.\"\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SPANÒ, MARIA.</b> Silver medal, Naples, 1859, for a picture of a\r\n\"Contadina of Sorrento.\" Born in Naples, 1843. Pupil of her father,\r\nRaffaele Spanò, under whose direction she made a thorough study of figure\r\npainting, the results of which are evident in her excellent portraits and\r\nhistorical subjects. She has also been greatly interested in landscape\r\npainting, in which she has been successful. \"A Confidence\" was bought by\r\nthe Gallery at Capodimonte, and two of her pictures were acquired by the\r\nProvincial Council of Naples--a \"Contadina,\" life size, and a \"Country\r\nFarmyard.\" One of her best pictures is \"Bice at the Castle of Rosate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SPILIMBERG, IRENE DI.</b> Born in Udina, 1540. Her family was of German\r\norigin and exalted position. She was educated in Venice with great care\r\nand all the advantages that wealth could command. She was much in the\r\nsociety of learned men, which she preferred before that of the world of\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nTitian was her roaster in painting. Lanzi and Rudolfi praised her as an\r\nartist, and her fame now rests on the testimony of those who saw her\r\nworks rather than on the pictures themselves, some of which are said to\r\nbe in private collections in Italy. Titian painted her portrait as a\r\ntribute to her beauty; Tasso celebrated her intellectual charm in a\r\nsonnet, and yet she was but nineteen years old when she died.\r\n\r\nTwenty years later a collection of orations and poems was published, all\r\nof which set forth her attractions and acquirements, and emphasized the\r\nsadness of her early death and the loss that the world had suffered\r\nthereby. When one remembers how soon after death those who have done a\r\nlife work are forgotten, such a memorial to one so young is worthy of\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SPURR, GERTRUDE E.</b> Associate member of Royal Canadian Academy and\r\nmember of the Ontario Society of Arts. Born in Scarborough, England.\r\nPupil of the Lambeth Art School in drawing, of E. H. Holder in painting,\r\nin England; also of George B. Bridgman in New York. This artist usually\r\npaints small pictures of rural scenery in England and Wales--little stone\r\ncottages, bridges, river and mountain scenes. \"Castle Rock, North Devon,\"\r\nwas exhibited at Buffalo, and is owned by Herbert Mason, Esq., of\r\nToronto. \"A Peep at Snowdon\" and \"Dutch Farm Door, Ontario,\" are in\r\nMontreal collections. Her works have been exhibited in London at the\r\nRoyal Society of British Artists and the Society of Lady Artists, and\r\nhave been sold from these exhibitions.\r\n\r\nI quote from the _Queen_, in reference to one of Miss Spurr's London\r\nexhibitions: \"We know of no more favorite sketching-ground in N. Wales\r\nfor the artist than Bettws-y-coed. Every yard of that most picturesque\r\ndistrict has been painted and sketched over and over again. The artist in\r\nthis instance reproduces some of the very primitive cottages in which the\r\nnatives of the principality sojourn. The play of light on the modest\r\ndwelling-places is an effective element in the cleverly rendered drawing\r\nnow in the Society of Artists' Exhibition. Miss Spurr, the daughter of a\r\nScarboro lawyer, commenced her art studies with Mr. E. H. Holder, in the\r\nwinter painting dead birds, fruit, and other natural objects, and in\r\nsummer spending her time on the coast or in the woods or about Rievaulx\r\nAbbey. Any remaining time to be filled up was occupied by attending the\r\nScarboro School of Art under the instruction of Mr. Strange. In a local\r\nsketching club Miss Spurr distinguished herself and gained several\r\nprizes, and she has at length taken up her abode in the metropolis, where\r\nshe has attended the Lambeth Schools, studying diligently both from casts\r\nand life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>STACEY, ANNA L.</b> Honorable mention at Exhibition of Chicago Artists,\r\n1900; Young Fortnightly Club prize, 1902; Martin B.

Paints portraits, figure subjects, and\r\nlandscapes. The Cahn prize was awarded to the \"Village at Twilight.\"\r\n\"Florence\" is owned by the Klio Club; \"Trophies of the Fields,\" by the\r\nUnion League Club, Chicago.\r\n\r\nRecently Miss Stacey has painted a number of successful portraits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>STADING, EVELINA.</b> Born in Stockholm. 1803-1829. She was a pupil of\r\nFahlcrantz for a time in her native city, and then went to Dresden, where\r\nshe made a thorough study and some excellent copies of the works of\r\nRuisdael. In 1827 she went to Rome, making studies in Volzburg and the\r\nTyrol _en route_. She painted views in Switzerland and Italy, and two of\r\nher landscapes are in the gallery in Christiania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>STANLEY, LADY DOROTHY.</b> Member of the Ladies' Athenaeum Club. Born in\r\nLondon. Pupil of Sir Edward Poynter--then Mr. Poynter--and of M.

Other pictures\r\nof hers are \"A Water Nymph,\" \"The Bathers,\" etc., which are in private\r\ngalleries. \"Leap Frog\" was in the Academy exhibition, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>STEBBINS, EMMA.</b> 1815-1882. Born in New York. As an amateur artist\r\nMiss Stebbins made a mark by her work in black and white and her pictures\r\nin oils. After a time she decided to devote herself to sculpture. In\r\nRome she studied this art and made her first success with a statuette of\r\n\"Joseph.\" This was followed by \"Columbus\" and \"Satan Descending to tempt\r\nMankind.\" For Central Park, New York, she executed a large fountain, the\r\nsubject being \"The Angel of the Waters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>STEPHENS, MRS. ALICE BARBER.</b> Mary Smith prize, 1890. Pupil of the\r\nPennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and of the Julian Academy, Paris. An\r\nillustrator whose favorite subjects are those of every-day home life--the\r\nbaby, the little child, the grandmother in cap and spectacles, etc.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>STEVENS, EDITH BARRETTO.</b> Two scholarships and a prize of one hundred\r\ndollars from the Art Students' League, of which she is a member. Born in\r\nHouston, Virginia, in 1878. Studied at Art Students' League and under\r\nDaniel C. French and George Gray Barnard.\r\n\r\nMiss Stevens mentions as her principal works \"A Candlestick Representing\r\na Girl Asleep under a Poppy,\" \"Figure of Spring,\" and the \"Spirit of\r\nFlame.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Stevens is one of the women sculptors who have been selected to\r\nshare in the decoration of the buildings for the St. Louis Exposition.\r\nShe is to make two reclining figures on the pediment over the main\r\nentrance to the Liberal Arts Building. She has in her studio two\r\nreclining figures which will probably serve to fulfil this commission.\r\n\r\nMiss Stevens is modest about her work and does not care to talk much\r\nabout this important commission, even suggesting that her design may not\r\nbe accepted; if she is successful it will certainly be an unusual honor\r\nfor a woman at her age, whose artistic career covers less than five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>STEVENS, MARY.</b> Bronze medal at the Crystal Palace. Member of the\r\nDudley Gallery, London. Born at Liverpool. Pupil of William Kerry and of\r\nher husband, Albert Stevens, in England, and of the Julian Academy,\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stevens' pictures were well considered when she exhibited a variety\r\nof subjects; of late, however, she has made a specialty of pictures of\r\ngardens, and has painted in many famous English and French gardens, among\r\nothers, those of Holland House, Warwick Castle, and St. Anne's, Dublin.\r\nIn France, the gardens of the Duchesse de Dino and the Countess Foucher\r\nde Careil.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stevens--several of whose works are owned in America--has\r\ncommissions to paint in some American gardens and intends to execute them\r\nin 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>STILLMAN, MARIE SPARTALI.</b> Pupil of Ford Madox Brown. This artist\r\nfirst exhibited in public at the Dudley Gallery, London, in 1867, a\r\npicture called \"Lady Pray's Desire.\" In 1870 she exhibited at the Royal\r\nAcademy, \"Saint Barbara\" and \"The Mystic Tryst.\" In 1873 she exhibited\r\n\"The Finding of Sir Lancelot Disguised as a Fool\" and \"Sir Tristram and\r\nLa Belle Isolde,\" both in water-colors. Of these, a writer in the _Art\r\nJournal_ said: \"Mrs. Stillman has brought imagination to her work. These\r\nvistas of garden landscape are conceived in the true spirit of romantic\r\nluxuriance, when the beauty of each separate flower was a delight. The\r\nfigures, too, have a grace that belongs properly to art, and which has\r\nbeen well fitted to pictorial expression. The least satisfactory part of\r\nthese clever drawings is their color. There is an evident feeling of\r\nharmony, but the effect is confused and the prevailing tones are\r\nuncomfortably warm.\"\r\n\r\nW. M. Rossetti wrote: \"Miss Spartali has a fine power of fusing the\r\nemotion of her subject into its color and of giving aspiration to both;\r\nbeyond what is actually achieved one sees a reaching toward something\r\nulterior. As one pauses before her work, a film in that or in the mind\r\nlifts or seems meant to lift, and a subtler essence from within the\r\npicture quickens the sense. In short, Miss Spartali, having a keen\r\nperception of the poetry which resides in beauty and in the means of art\r\nfor embodying beauty, succeeds in infusing that perception into the\r\nspectator of her handiwork.\"\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>STOCKS, MINNA.</b> Born in Scheverin, 1846. Pupil of Schloepke in\r\nScheverin, Stiffeck in Berlin, E. Bosch in Düsseldorf, and J. Bauck in\r\nMunich. Her \"Lake of Scheverin\" is in the Museum of her native city.\r\n\r\nHer artistic reputation rests largely on her pictures of animals. She\r\nexhibits at the Expositions of the Society of Women Artists, Berlin, and\r\namong her pictures seen there is \"A Journey through Africa,\" which\r\nrepresents kittens playing with a map of that country. It was attractive\r\nand was praised for its artistic merit. In fact, her puppies and kittens\r\nare most excellent results--have been called masterpieces--of the most\r\nintimate and intelligent study of nature.\r\n\r\nAmong her works are \"A Quartet of Cats,\" \"The Hostile Brothers,\" and \"The\r\nOutcast.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>STOKES, MARIANNA.</b> Honorable mention at Paris Salon, 1884; gold medal\r\nin Munich, 1890; medal at Chicago in 1893. Member of the Society of\r\nPainters in Tempera. Born in Graz-Styria. Pupil of Professor W. von\r\nLindenschmit in Munich, of M. Dagnan Bouveret and M. Courtois in Paris.\r\n\r\nHer picture, \"A Parting,\" is in the Liverpool Gallery; \"Childhood's\r\nWonder,\" in the Nottingham Gallery; \"Aucassin and Nicolette,\" in the\r\nPittsburg Gallery, etc.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stokes writes me that she has taken great interest in the revival of\r\ntempera painting in recent years. In reviewing the exhibition in the New\r\nGallery, London, the _Spectator_ of May 2, 1903, speaks of the portraits\r\nby Mrs. Stokes as charming, and adds: \"They are influenced by the\r\nprimitive painters, but in the right way. That is, the painter has used a\r\nformal and unrealistic style, but without any sacrifice of artistic\r\nfreedom.\" Of a portrait of a child the same writer says: \"It would be\r\ndifficult to imagine a happier portrait of a little child,... and in it\r\nmay be seen how the artist has used her freedom; for although she has\r\npreserved a primitive simplicity, the sky, sea, and windmill have modern\r\nqualities of atmosphere. The picture is very subtle in drawing and color,\r\nand the sympathy for child-life is perfect, seen as it is both in the\r\nhands and in the eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Another portrait by the same artist is hung on a marble pillar at the\r\ntop of the stairs leading up to the balcony. The admirable qualities of\r\ndecoration are well shown by the way it is hung.... Is a fine piece of\r\nstrong and satisfactory color, but the decorative aspect in no way takes\r\nprecedence of the portraiture. We think of the man first and the picture\r\nafterward.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Academy, in 1903, Mrs. Stokes exhibited a portrait of J. Westlake,\r\nEsq., K.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>STORER, MRS. MARIA LONGWORTH.</b> Gold medal at Paris Exposition, 1900.\r\nBorn in Cincinnati, Ohio. Pupil of the Cincinnati Art School, which her\r\nfather, Joseph Longworth, endowed with three hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nAfter working four years, making experiments in clay decoration at the\r\nDallas White Ware Pottery, Mrs. Storer, \"who had the enthusiasm of the\r\nartistic temperament coupled with fixity of purpose and financial\r\nresources,... had the courage to open a Pottery which she called\r\nRookwood, the name of her father's place on the hills beyond. This was in\r\n1880.\"\r\n\r\nNine years later this pottery had become self-supporting, and Mrs. Storer\r\nthen dissolved her personal association with it, leaving it in charge of\r\nMr. William Watts Taylor, who had collaborated with her during six years.\r\n\r\nAt the Paris Exposition Mrs. Storer exhibited about twenty pieces of\r\npottery mounted in bronze--all her own work. It was an exquisite\r\nexhibition, and I was proud that it was the work of one of my\r\ncountrywomen.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Mr. Storer was appointed United States minister to Belgium, and\r\nMrs. Storer took a Japanese artist, Asano, to Brussels, to instruct her\r\nin bronze work. Two years later Mr. Storer's mission was changed to\r\nSpain, and there Mrs. Storer continued, under Asano's guidance, her work\r\nin bronze, some of the results being seen in the mounting of her pottery.\r\n\r\nAt present Mr. Storer is our Ambassador to Austria, and Mrs. Storer\r\nwrites me that she hopes to continue her work in bronze in Vienna.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1903 Mrs. Storer was in Colorado Springs, where she was\r\nmuch interested in the pottery made by Mr. Van Briggle. She became one of\r\nthe directors of the Van Briggle Pottery Company, and encouraged the\r\nundertaking most heartily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>STUMM, MAUD.</b> Born in Cleveland, Ohio. Pupil of Art Students' League\r\nunder Kenyon Cox and Siddons Mowbray, and of Oliver Merson in Paris,\r\nwhere her painting was also criticised and approved by Whistler. Her\r\nearliest work was flower painting, in which she gained an enviable\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nIn Paris she began the study of figure painting, and her exhibition at\r\nthe Salon was favorably received, the purity and brilliancy of her\r\ncoloring being especially commended.\r\n\r\nSeveral of Miss Stumm's pictures are well known by reproductions. Among\r\nthese is the \"Mother and Child,\" the original of which is owned by Mr.\r\nPatterson, of the Chicago _Tribune_. Her calendars, too, are artistic and\r\npopular; some of these have reached a sale of nearly half a million.\r\n\r\nA series of studies of Sarah Bernhardt, in pastel, and a portrait of\r\nJulia Marlowe are among her works in this medium. Many of her figure\r\nsubjects, such as \"A Venetian Matron\" and \"A Violinist,\" are portraits,\r\nnot studies from professional models.\r\n\r\nThis artist has painted an unusual variety of subjects, but is ambitious\r\nin still another department of painting--decorative art--in which she\r\nbelieves she could succeed.\r\n\r\nHer works are seen in the exhibitions of the Society of American Artists\r\nand of the American Water-Color Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SWOBODA, JOSEPHINE.</b> Born in Vienna, 1861. Pupil of Laufberger and I.\r\nV. Berger. This portrait artist has been successful and numbers among her\r\nsubjects the Princess Henry of Prussia, the late Queen of England, whose\r\nportrait she painted at Balmoral in 1893, the Minister Bauhaus, and\r\nseveral members of the royal house of Austria. The portrait of Queen\r\nVictoria was exhibited at the Water-Color Club, Vienna.\r\n\r\nShe also paints charming miniatures. Her pictures are in both oil and\r\nwater-colors, and are praised by the critics of the exhibitions in which\r\nthey are seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SWOPE, MRS.

Member of Louisville Art\r\nLeague. Born in Louisville, Kentucky. Pupil of Edgar Ward and M. Flagg in\r\nNew York, and later of B. R. Fitz.\r\n\r\nMrs. Swope devotes herself almost entirely to sacred subjects. The\r\npictures that have been awarded medals are Madonnas. She prefers to paint\r\nher pictures out of doors and in the sunlight, which results in her\r\nworking in a high key and, as she writes, \"in tender, opalescent color.\"\r\n\r\nOne of her medal pictures is the \"Head of a Madonna,\" out of doors, in a\r\nhazy, blue shadow, against a background of grapevine foliage. The head is\r\ndraped in white; the eyes are cast down upon the beholder. A sun spot\r\nkisses the white draperies on the shoulder. It is a young, girlish face,\r\nbut the head is suggestive of great exaltation.\r\n\r\nA second picture which received an award was a \"Madonna and Child,\" out\r\nof doors. The figure is half life size. Dressed in white, the Madonna is\r\nstretched at full length upon the grass. Raised on one arm, she gazes\r\ninto the face of the infant Christ Child.\r\n\r\nMrs. Swope has had success in pastel, in which, not long since, she\r\nexhibited a \"Mother and Child,\" which was much admired. The mother--in an\r\narbor--held the child up and reverently kissed the cheek. It was called\r\n\"Love,\" and was exhibited in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago.\r\n\r\nMrs. Swope's most ambitious work--five by three feet in size--represents\r\nan allegorical subject and is called \"Revelation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SUES, MLLE.

Born at Genoa and studied there under Professors\r\nGillet, Poggy, and Castan.\r\n\r\nThis artist paints landscapes, Swiss subjects principally. Her pictures\r\nof Mont Blanc and Chamounix are popular and have been readily sold. They\r\nare in private collections in several countries, and when exhibited have\r\nbeen praised in German and French as well as in Swiss publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SYAMOUR, MME.

Her works are\r\nnumerous and have been seen in many exhibitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>THAULOW, MME. ALEXANDRA.</b> Wife of the great Scandinavian painter.\r\nThis lady is an artist in bookbinding and her work is much admired. A\r\nwriter, H. F., says, in the _Studio_, December, 1903: \"When the\r\nexhibition of bookbinding was held some time ago at the Musée Galliera,\r\nMadame Thaulow's showcase attracted attention by its variety and its\r\ngrace. The charm of these bindings lies in the fact that they have none\r\nof the massive heaviness of so many productions of this kind. One should\r\nbe able to handle a book with ease, and not be forced to rest content\r\nwith beholding it displaying its beauties behind glass or on the library\r\nshelf; and Madame Thaulow understood this perfectly when she executed the\r\nbindings now reproduced here. But these bindings are interesting not only\r\nfrom the standpoint of their utility and intelligent application; their\r\nornamentation delights one by its graceful interpretation of Nature,\r\nrendered with a very special sense of decoration; moreover, the coloring\r\nof these mosaics of leather is restrained and fresh, and the hollyhocks\r\nand the hortensias, the bunches of mistletoe and the poppies, which form\r\nsome of her favorite _motifs_, go to make up a delicious symphony.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>THEVENIN, MARIE ANNE ROSALIE.</b> Medals at the Salons of 1849, 1859,\r\n1861. Born at Lyons. Pupil of Leon Cogniet.

Daughter of John Francis,\r\nthe sculptor, whose pupil she was. This artist exhibited at the Royal\r\nAcademy when very young. Her first important work was a life-size figure\r\ncalled \"The Flower-Girl.\" In 1840 she married Thomas Thornycroft, and\r\nwent to Rome two years later, spending a year in study there. Queen\r\nVictoria, after her return, commissioned her to execute statues of the\r\nroyal children as the Four Seasons. These were much admired when\r\nexhibited at the Academy. Later she made portrait statues and busts of\r\nmany members of the royal family, which were also seen at the Academy\r\nExhibition.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Essays on Art,\" Palgrave wrote: \"Sculpture has at no time\r\nnumbered many successful followers among women. We have, however, in Mrs.\r\nThornycroft, one such artist who, by some recent advance and by the\r\ndegrees of success which she has already reached, promises fairly for the\r\nart. Some of this lady's busts have refinement and feeling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>THURBER, CAROLINE NETTLETON.</b> Born in Oberlin, Ohio. Pupil of Howard\r\nHelmick in Washington, and of Benjamin Constant and Jean Paul Laurens in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Mrs. Thurber took a studio in Paris, where her first work was the\r\nportrait of a young violinist, which was exhibited in the Salon of the\r\nfollowing spring. This picture met with immediate favor with the public,\r\nthe art critics, and the press. The Duchess of Sutherland, upon seeing\r\nit, sent for the artist and arranged for a portrait of her daughter,\r\nwhich was painted the following autumn while Mrs. Thurber was a guest at\r\nDunrobin Castle. This portrait was subsequently exhibited in London and\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thurber has painted portraits of many persons of distinction in\r\nParis, among them one of Mlle. Ollivier, only daughter of Émile Ollivier,\r\npresident of the Académie Française. Monsieur Ollivier, in a personal\r\nnote to the artist, made the following comment upon the portrait of his\r\ndaughter: \"How much I thank you for the portrait of my daughter; it\r\nlives, so powerfully is it colored, and one is tempted to speak to it.\"\r\nMrs. Thurber is an exhibitor in the Salon, Royal Academy, and New\r\nGallery, London, and other foreign exhibitions, as well as in those of\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nShe now has a studio in the family home at Bristol, Rhode Island, on\r\nNarragansett Bay, where she works during half the year. In winter she\r\ndivides her time among the larger cities as her orders demand. While Mrs.\r\nThurber's name is well known through her special success in the\r\nportraiture of children, she has painted many prominent men and women in\r\nChicago, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and New England.\r\n\r\nAmong her later portraits are those of Mrs. James Sullivan, one of the\r\nlady commissioners of the St. Louis Exposition; Lieut.-Gen. Nelson A.\r\nMiles; Albert, son of Dr. Shaw, editor of the _Review of Reviews_; Mrs.\r\nA. A. F. Johnston, former Dean of Oberlin College; Augustus S. Miller,\r\nmayor of Providence; Hon. L. F. C. Garvin, governor of Rhode Island; and\r\nJudge Austin Adams, late of the Supreme Court of Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>THURWANGER, FELICITÉ CHASTANIER.</b> This remarkable artist, not long\r\nsince, when eighty-four years old, sent to the exhibition at Nice--which\r\nis, in a sense, a branch of the Paris Salon--three portraits which she\r\nhad just finished. \"They were hung in the place of honor and unanimously\r\nvoted to belong to the first class.\"\r\n\r\nMme. Thurwanger was the pupil of Delacroix during five years. The master\r\nunconsciously did his pupil an injury by saying to her father: \"That\r\ndaughter of yours is wonderfully gifted, and if she were a man I would\r\nmake a great artist of her.\" Hearing this, the young artist burst into\r\ntears, and her whole career was clouded by the thought that her sex\r\nprevented her being a really great artist, and induced in her an abnormal\r\nmodesty. This occurred about forty-five years ago; since then we have\r\nsignally changed all that!\r\n\r\nDelacroix, who was an enthusiast in color, was the leader of one school\r\nof his time, and was opposed by Ingres, who was so wanting in this regard\r\nthat he was accused of being color-blind.\r\n\r\nMme. Thurwanger had a curious experience with these artists. When but\r\nseventeen she was commissioned by the Government to copy a picture in the\r\nLouvre. One morning, when she was working in the Gallery, Ingres passed\r\nby and stopped to look at her picture. He examined it carefully, and with\r\nan expression of satisfaction said: \"I am so very glad to see that you\r\nhave the true idea of art! Remember always that there is no color in\r\nNature; the outline is all; if the outline is good, no matter about the\r\ncoloring, the picture will be good.\"\r\n\r\nThis story would favor the color-blind theory, as Ingres apparently saw\r\ncolor neither in the original nor the copy.\r\n\r\nAn hour later Delacroix came to watch the work of his pupil, and after a\r\nfew minutes exclaimed: \"I am so happy, my dear girl, to see that you have\r\nthe true and only spirit of art. Never forget that in Nature there is no\r\nline, no outline; everything is color!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1852 Mme. Thurwanger was in Philadelphia and remained more than two\r\nyears. She exhibited her pictures, which were favorably noticed by the\r\nPhiladelphia _Enquirer_. In July of the above year her portraits were\r\nenthusiastically praised. \"Not a lineament, not a feature, however\r\ntrivial, escapes the all-searching eye of the artist, who has the happy\r\nfaculty of causing the expression of the mind and soul to beam forth in\r\nthe life-like and speaking face.\"\r\n\r\nIn October, 1854, her picture of a \"Madonna and Child\" was thus noticed\r\nby the same paper: \"For brilliancy, animation, maternal solicitude, form,\r\ngrace, and feature, it would be difficult to imagine anything more\r\nimpressive. It is in every sense a gem of the pictorial art, while the\r\nexecution and finish are such as genius alone could inspire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>TIRLINKS, LIEWENA.</b> Born in Bruges, a daughter of Master Simon. This\r\nlady was not only esteemed as an artist in London, but she won the heart\r\nof an English nobleman, to whom she was given in marriage by Henry VIII.\r\nHer miniatures were much admired and greatly in fashion at the court.\r\nSome critics have thought the Tirlinks to be the same person with Liewena\r\nBennings or Benic, whose story, as we know it, is much the same as the\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>TORMOCZY, BERTHA VON.</b> Diploma of honor, Budapest and Agram. Born at\r\nInnspruck, 1846. Pupil of Hausch, Her, and Schindler. Among her pictures\r\nare \"Girl in the Garden,\" \"Blossoming Meadows,\" \"Autumn Morning,\" and a\r\nvariety of landscapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>TORO, PETRONELLA.</b> A painter of miniatures on ivory which have\r\nattained distinction. Among those best known are the portraits of the\r\nPrince of Carignano, Duke Amadeo, and the Duchess d'Aosta with the sons\r\nof the Prince of Carignano. She has painted a young woman in an antique\r\ndress and another in a modern costume. Her works are distinguished by\r\nfirmness of touch and great intelligence. She has executed some most\r\nattractive landscapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>TREU, OR TREY, KATHARINA.</b> Born at Bamberg. 1742-1811. A successful\r\npainter of flowers and still-life. Her talent was remarkable when but a\r\nchild, and her father, who was her only master, began her lessons when\r\nshe was ten years old. When still young she was appointed court painter\r\nat Mannheim, and in 1776 was made a professor in the Academy at\r\nDüsseldorf. Her pictures are in the Galleries of Bamberg and Carlsruhe,\r\nand in the Darmstadt and Stuttgart Museums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>URRUTIA DE URMENETA, ANA GERTRUDIS DE.</b> Member of the Academy of Fine\r\nArts, Cadiz, 1846. Born in Cadiz. 1812-1850. She began the study of\r\ndrawing with Javier, and after her marriage to Juan José de Urmeneta,\r\nprofessor of painting and sculpture and director of the Cadiz Academy,\r\ncontinued her work under his direction. A \"St. Filomena\" and\r\n\"Resurrection of the Body,\" exhibited in 1846, are among her best\r\npictures. Her \"St. Jeronimo\" is in the new cathedral at Cadiz, and the\r\nAcademy has shown respect to her memory by placing her portrait in the\r\nroom in which its sessions are held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>VIANI, MARIA.</b> Born at Bologna. 1670-1711. I find no reliable\r\nbiographical account of this artist, whose name appears in the catalogue\r\nof the Dresden Gallery as the painter of the \"Reclining Venus, lying on a\r\nblue cushion, with a Cupid at her side.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>VERELST, MARIAN.</b> Born in 1680. This artist belonged in Antwerp and\r\nwas of the celebrated artistic family of her name. She was a pupil of her\r\nfather, Hermann, and her uncle, Simon Verelst. She became famous for the\r\nexcellent likenesses she made and for the artistic qualities of her small\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\nLike so many other artists, she was distinguished for accomplishments\r\noutside her art. She was a fine musician and a marvel in her aptitude in\r\nacquiring both ancient and modern languages. A very interesting anecdote\r\nis related of her, as follows: When in London, one evening at the theatre\r\nshe sat near six German gentlemen, who expressed their admiration of her\r\nin the most flattering terms of their language, and at the same time\r\nobserved her so closely as to be extremely rude. The artist, in their own\r\ntongue, remarked that such extravagant praise was the opposite of a\r\ncompliment. One of them repeated his words in Latin, when she again\r\nreplied in the same language. The strangers then asked her if she would\r\ngive them her name. This she did and further told them that she lived\r\nwith her uncle, Simon Verelst. In the end she painted the portrait of\r\neach of these men, and the story of their experience proved the reason\r\nfor the acquaintance of the artist being sought by people of culture and\r\nposition. Walpole speaks in praise of her portraits and also mentions her\r\nunusual attainments in languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>VIGÉE, MARIE LOUISE ELIZABETH.</b> Member of the French Academy. Born in\r\nParis in 1755. That happy writer and learned critic, M. Charles Blanc,\r\nbegins his account of her thus: \"All the fairies gathered about the\r\ncradle of Elizabeth Vigée, as for the birth of a little princess in the\r\nkingdom of art. One gave her beauty, another genius; the fairy Gracious\r\noffered her a pencil and a palette. The fairy of marriage, who had not\r\nbeen summoned, told her, it is true, that she should wed M. Le Brun, the\r\nexpert in pictures--but for her consolation the fairy of travellers\r\npromised her that she should bear from court to court, from academy to\r\nacademy, from Paris to Petersburg, and from Rome to London, her gayety,\r\nher talent, and her easel--before which all the sovereigns of Europe and\r\nall those whom genius had crowned should place themselves as subjects for\r\nher brush.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FRENCH PRINCE\r\n\r\nMARIE VIGÉE LE BRUN]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to write of Madame Le Brun in outline because her life\r\nwas so interesting in detail. Though she had many sorrows, there is a\r\nhalo of romance and a brilliancy of atmosphere about her which marks her\r\nas a prominent woman of her day, and her autobiography is charming--it\r\nis so alive that one forgets that she is not present, telling her story!\r\n\r\nThe father of this gifted daughter was an artist of moderate ability and\r\nmade portraits in pastel, which Elizabeth, in her \"Souvenirs,\" speaks of\r\nas good and thinks some of them worthy of comparison with those of the\r\nfamous Latour. M. Vigée was an agreeable man with much vivacity of\r\nmanner. His friends were numerous and he was able to present his daughter\r\nto people whose acquaintance was of value to her. She was but twelve\r\nyears old at the time of his death, and he had already so encouraged her\r\ntalents as to make her future comparatively easy for her.\r\n\r\nElizabeth passed five years of her childhood in a convent, where she\r\nconstantly busied herself in sketching everything that she saw. She tells\r\nof her intense pleasure in the use of her pencil, and says that her\r\npassion for painting was innate and never grew less, but increased in\r\ncharm as she grew older. She claimed that it was a source of perpetual\r\nyouth, and that she owed to it her acquaintance and friendship with the\r\nmost delightful men and women of Europe.\r\n\r\nWhile still a young girl, Mlle. Vigée studied under Briard, Doyen, and\r\nGreuze, but Joseph Vernet advised her to study the works of Italian and\r\nFlemish masters, and, above all, to study Nature for herself--to follow\r\nno school or system. To this advice Mme. Le Brun attributed her success.\r\n\r\nWhen sixteen years old she presented two portraits to the French\r\nAcademy, and was thus early brought to public notice.\r\n\r\nWhen twenty-one she married M. Le Brun, of whom she speaks discreetly in\r\nher story of her life, but it was well known that he was of dissipated\r\nhabits and did not hesitate to spend all that his wife could earn. When\r\nshe left France, thirteen years after her marriage, she had not so much\r\nas twenty francs, although she had earned a million!\r\n\r\nShe painted portraits of many eminent people, and was esteemed as a\r\nfriend by men and women of culture and high position. The friendship\r\nbetween the artist and Marie Antoinette was a sincere and deep affection\r\nbetween two women, neither of whom remembered that one of them was a\r\nqueen. It was a great advantage to the artist to be thus intimately\r\nassociated with her sovereign lady. Even in the great state picture of\r\nthe Queen surrounded by her children, at Versailles, one realizes the\r\ntenderness of the painter as she lovingly reproduced her friend.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette desired that Mme. Le Brun should be elected to the\r\nAcademy; Vernet approved it, and an unusual honor was shown her in being\r\nmade an Academician before the completion of her reception picture. At\r\nthat time it was a great advantage to be a member of the Academy, as no\r\nother artists were permitted to exhibit their works in the Salon of the\r\nBeaux-Arts.\r\n\r\nMme. Le Brun had one habit with which she allowed nothing to interfere,\r\nwhich was taking a rest after her work for the day was done. She called\r\nit her \"calm,\" and to it she attributed a large share of her power of\r\nendurance, although it lost her many pleasures. She could not go out to\r\ndinner or entertain at that hour. The evening was her only time for\r\nsocial pleasures. But when one reads her \"Souvenirs,\" and realizes how\r\nmany notable people she met in her studio and in evening society, it\r\nscarcely seems necessary to regret that she could not dine out!\r\n\r\nMme. Le Brun was at one period thought to be very extravagant, and one of\r\nher entertainments caused endless comments. Her own account of it shows\r\nhow greatly the cost was exaggerated. She writes that on one occasion she\r\ninvited twelve or fifteen friends to listen to her brother's reading\r\nduring her \"calm.\" The poem read was the \"Voyage du jeune Anacharsis en\r\nGrèce,\" in which a dinner was described, and even the receipts for making\r\nvarious sauces were given. The artist was seized with the idea of\r\nimprovising a Greek supper.\r\n\r\nShe summoned her cook and instructed her in what had been read. Among her\r\nguests were several unusually pretty ladies, who attired themselves in\r\nGreek costumes as nearly as the time permitted. Mme. Le Brun retained the\r\nwhite blouse she wore at her work, adding a veil and a crown of flowers.\r\nHer studio was rich in antique objects, and a dealer whom she knew loaned\r\nher cups, vases, and lamps. All was arranged with the effect an artist\r\nknows how to produce.\r\n\r\nAs the guests arrived Mme. Le Brun added here and there an element of\r\nGrecian costume until their number was sufficient for an effective\r\n_tableau vivant_. Her daughter and a little friend were dressed as pages\r\nand bore antique vases. A canopy hung over the table, the guests were\r\nposed in picturesque attitudes, and those who arrived later were arrested\r\nat the door of the supper-room with surprise and delight.\r\n\r\nIt was as if they had been transported to another clime. A Greek song was\r\nchanted to the accompaniment of a lyre, and when the honey, grapes, and\r\nother dishes were served _à la Grecque_, the enchantment was complete.\r\nThe poet recited odes from Anacreon and all passed off delightfully.\r\n\r\nThe fame of this novel supper was spread over Paris, and marvellous tales\r\nwere told of its magnificence and its cost. Mme. Le Brun writes: \"Some\r\nladies asked me to repeat this pleasantry. I refused for various reasons,\r\nand several of them were disturbed by my refusal. Soon a report that the\r\nsupper had cost me twenty thousand francs was spread abroad. The King\r\nspoke of it as a joke to the Marquis of Cubières, who fortunately had\r\nbeen one of the guests and was able to convince His Majesty of the folly\r\nof such a story. Nevertheless, the modest sum of twenty thousand at\r\nVersailles became forty thousand at Rome; at Vienna the Baroness de\r\nStrogonoff told me that I had spent sixty thousand francs for my Greek\r\nsupper; you know that at Petersburg the price at length was fixed at\r\neighty thousand francs, and the truth is that it cost me about fifteen\r\nfrancs!\"\r\n\r\nEarly in 1789, when the warnings of the horrors about to take place began\r\nto be heard, Mme. Le Brun went to Italy. In each city that she visited\r\nshe was received with great kindness and many honors were shown her. In\r\nFlorence she was invited to paint her own portrait, to be hung in that\r\npart of the Uffizi set apart for the portraits of famous painters. Later\r\nshe sent the well-known portrait, near that of Angelica Kauffman. It is\r\ninteresting to read Goethe's comparison of the two portraits.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Angelica's first, he writes: \"It has a truer tone in the\r\ncoloring, the position is more pleasing, and the whole exhibits more\r\ncorrect taste and a higher spirit in art. But the work of Le Brun shows\r\nmore careful execution, has more vigor in the drawing, and more delicate\r\ntouches. It, has, moreover, a clear though somewhat exaggerated coloring.\r\nThe Frenchwoman understands the art of adornment--the headdress, the\r\nhair, the folds of lace on the bosom, all are arranged with care and, as\r\none might say, _con amore_. The piquant, handsome face, with its lively\r\nexpression, its parted lips disclosing a row of pearly teeth, presents\r\nitself to the beholder's gaze as if coquettishly challenging his\r\nadmiration, while the hand holds the pencil as in the act of drawing.\r\n\r\n\"The picture of Angelica, with head gently inclined and a soft,\r\nintellectual melancholy pervading the countenance, evinces higher genius,\r\neven if, in point of artistic skill, the preference should be given to\r\nthe other.\"\r\n\r\nMme. Le Brun found Rome delightful and declared that if she could forget\r\nFrance she should be the happiest of women. She writes of her fellow\r\nartist: \"I have been to see Angelica Kauffman, whom I greatly desired to\r\nknow. I found her very interesting, apart from her fine talent, on\r\naccount of her mind and her general culture.... She has talked much with\r\nme during the two evenings I have passed at her house. Her manner is\r\ngentle; she is prodigiously learned, but has no enthusiasm, which,\r\nconsidering my ignorance, has not electrified me.... I have seen several\r\nof her works; her sketches please me more than her pictures, because they\r\nare of a Titianesque color.\"\r\n\r\nMme. Le Brun received more commissions for portraits than she could find\r\ntime to paint in the three years she lived in Italy. She tells us: \"Not\r\nonly did I find great pleasure in painting surrounded by so many\r\nmasterpieces, but it was also necessary for me to make another fortune. I\r\nhad not a hundred francs of income. Happily I had only to choose among\r\nthe grandest people the portraits which it pleased me to paint.\" Her\r\naccount of her experiences in Italy is very entertaining, but at last the\r\nrestlessness of the exile overcame her and impelled her to seek other\r\nscenes. She went to Vienna and there remained three other years, making\r\nmany friends and painting industriously until the spirit of unrest drove\r\nher to seek new diversions, and she went to Russia.\r\n\r\nShe was there received with great cordiality and remained six\r\nyears--years crowded with kindness, labor, honor, attainment, joy, and\r\nsorrow. Her daughter was the one all-absorbing passion--at once the joy\r\nand the grief of her life. She was so charming and so gifted as to\r\nsatisfy the critical requirements of her mother's desires. In Petersburg,\r\nwhere the daughter was greatly admired and caressed, the artist found\r\nherself a thousand times more happy than she had ever been in her own\r\ntriumphs.\r\n\r\nMme. Le Brun was so constantly occupied and the need of earning was so\r\ngreat with her, that she was forced to confide her daughter to the care\r\nof others when she made her début in society. Thus it happened that the\r\nyoung girl met M. Nigris, whom she afterward married. Personally he was\r\nnot agreeable to Mme. Le Brun and his position was not satisfactory to\r\nher. We can imagine her chagrin in accepting a son-in-law who even asked\r\nher for money with which to go to church on his wedding-day! The whole\r\naffair was most distasteful, and the marriage occurred at the time of the\r\ndeath of Mme. Le Brun's mother. She speaks of it as a \"time devoted to\r\ntears.\"\r\n\r\nHer health suffered so much from this sadness that she tried the benefit\r\nof change of scene, and went to Moscow. Returning to Petersburg, she\r\ndetermined--in spite of the remonstrances of her friends, and the\r\ninducements offered her to remain--to go to France. She several times\r\ninterrupted her journey in order to paint portraits of persons who had\r\nheard of her fame, and desired to have her pictures.\r\n\r\nShe reached Paris in 1801 and writes thus of her return: \"I shall not\r\nattempt to express my emotions when I was again upon the soil of France,\r\nfrom which I had been absent twelve years. Fright, grief, joy possessed\r\nme, each in turn, for all these entered into the thousand varying\r\nsentiments which swept over my soul. I wept for the friends whom I had\r\nlost upon the scaffold, but I was about to see again those who remained.\r\nThis France to which I returned had been the scene of atrocious crimes;\r\nbut this France was my Native Land!\"\r\n\r\nBut the new régime was odious to the artist, and she found herself unable\r\nto be at home, even in Paris. After a year she went to London, and\r\nremained in England three years. She detested the climate and was not in\r\nlove with the people, but she found a compensation in the society of many\r\nFrench families who had fled from France as she had done.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 Mme. Nigris was in Paris and her mother returned to see her. The\r\nyoung woman was very beautiful and attractive, very fond of society,\r\nentirely indifferent to her husband, and not always wise in the choice of\r\nher companions. Mme. Le Brun, always hard at work and always having great\r\nanxieties, at length found herself so broken in health, and so nervously\r\nfatigued that she longed to be alone with Nature, and in 1808 she went to\r\nSwitzerland. Her letters written to the Countess Potocka at this time are\r\nadded to her \"Souvenirs,\" and reveal the very best of her nature. Feeling\r\nthe need of continued repose, she bought a house at Louveciennes, where\r\nshe spent much time. In 1818 M. Le Brun died, and six years later the\r\ndeaths of her daughter and her brother left her with no near relative in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nFor a time she sought distractions in new scenes and visited the Touraine\r\nand other parts of France, but though she still lived a score of years,\r\nshe spent them in Paris and Louveciennes. She had with her two nieces,\r\nwho cared for her more tenderly than any one had done before. One of\r\nthese ladies was a portrait painter and profited much by the advice of\r\nMme. Le Brun, who wrote of this period and these friends: \"They made me\r\nfeel again the sentiments of a mother, and their tender devotion\r\ndiffused a great charm over my life. It is near these two dear ones and\r\nsome friends who remain to me that I hope to terminate peacefully a life\r\nwhich has been wandering but calm, laborious but honorable.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the last years of her life the most distinguished society of Paris\r\nwas wont to assemble about her--artists, litterateurs, savants, and men\r\nof the fashionable world. Here all essential differences of opinion were\r\nlaid aside and all met on common ground. Her \"calm\" seemed to have\r\ninfluenced all her life; only good feeling and equality found a place\r\nnear her, and few women have the blessed fortune to be so sincerely\r\nmourned by a host of friends as was Elizabeth Vigée Le Brun, dying at the\r\nage of eighty-seven.\r\n\r\nMme. Le Brun's works numbered six hundred and sixty portraits--fifteen\r\ngenre or figure pictures and about two hundred landscapes painted from\r\nsketches made on her journeys. Her portraits included those of the\r\nsovereigns and royal families of all Europe, as well as the most famous\r\nauthors, artists, singers, and the learned men in Church and State.\r\n\r\nAs an artist M. Charles Blanc thus esteems her: \"In short, Mme. Le Brun\r\nbelonged entirely to the eighteenth century--I wish to say to that period\r\nof our time which rested itself suddenly at David. While she followed the\r\ncounsels of Vernet, her pencil had a certain suppleness, and her brush a\r\nforce; but she too often attempted to imitate Greuze in her later works\r\nand she weakened the resemblance to her subjects by abusing the _regard\r\nnoyé_ (cloudy or indistinct effect). She was too early in vogue to make\r\nall the necessary studies, and she too often contented herself with an\r\ningenuity a little too manifest. Without judging her as complacently as\r\nthe Academy formerly judged her, we owe her an honorable place, because\r\nin spite of revolutions and reforms she continued to her last day the\r\nlight, spiritual, and French Art of Watteau, Nattier, and Fragonard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>VIGRI, CATERINA DE.</b> Lippo Dalmasii was much admired by Malvasia, who\r\nnot only extols his pictures, but his spirit as well, and represents him\r\nas following his art as a religion, beginning and ending his daily work\r\nwith prayer. Lippo is believed to have been the master of Caterina de\r\nVigri, and the story of her life is in harmony with the influence of such\r\na teacher.\r\n\r\nShe is the only woman artist who has been canonized; and in the Convent\r\nof the Corpus Domini, in Bologna, which she founded, she is known as \"La\r\nSanta,\" and as a special patron of the Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nCaterina was of a noble family of Ferrara, where she was born in 1413.\r\nShe died when fifty years old; and so great was the reverence for her\r\nmemory that her remains were preserved, and may still be seen in a chapel\r\nof her convent. There are few places in that ever wonderful Italy of such\r\npeculiar interest as this chapel, where sits, clothed in a silken robe,\r\nwith a crown of gold on the head, the incorrupt body of a woman who died\r\nfour hundred and forty years ago. The body is quite black, while the\r\nnails are still pink. She holds a book and a sceptre. Around her, in the\r\nwell-lighted chapel, are several memorials of her life: the viola on\r\nwhich she played, and a manuscript in her exquisite chirography, also a\r\nservice book illuminated by Caterina, and, still more important, one of\r\nher pictures, a \"Madonna and Child,\" inserted in the wall on the left of\r\nthe chapel, which is admirable for the beauty of expression in the face\r\nof the Holy Mother.\r\n\r\nWe cannot trace Caterina's artist life step by step, but she doubtless\r\nworked with the same spirit of consecration and prayer as did that Beato\r\nwhom we call Angelico, in his Florentine convent, a century earlier.\r\n\r\nCaterina executed many miniatures, and her easel pictures were not large.\r\nThese were owned by private families. She is known to us by two pictures\r\nof \"St. Ursula folding her Robe about her Companions.\" One is in the\r\nBologna Gallery, the other in the Academy in Venice. The first is on a\r\nwooden panel, and was painted when the artist was thirty-nine years old.\r\nThe Saint is represented as unnaturally tall, the figures of her virgins\r\nbeing very small. The mantle and robe of St. Ursula are of rich brocade\r\nornamented with floral designs, while on each side of her is a white\r\nflag, on which is a red cross. The face of the saint is so attractive\r\nthat one forgets the elongation of her figure. There is a delicacy in the\r\nexecution, combined with a freedom and firmness of handling fully equal\r\nto the standard of her school and time. Many honors were paid to the\r\nmemory of Caterina de Vigri. She was chosen as the protectress of\r\nAcademies and Art Institutions, and in the eighteenth century a medal was\r\ncoined, on which she is represented as painting on a panel held by an\r\nangel. How few human beings are thus honored three centuries after death!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>VINCENT, MME.</b> See Labille.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>VISSCHER, ANNA AND MARIA.</b> These daughters of the celebrated Dutch\r\nengraver were known as \"the Dutch Muses.\" They made their best reputation\r\nby their etchings on glass, but they were also well known for their\r\nwriting of both poetry and prose. They were associated with the scholars\r\nof their time and were much admired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>VOLKMAR, ANTONIE ELIZABETH CAECILIA.</b> Born in Berlin, 1827. She\r\nstudied with Schroder in her native city, with L. Cogniet in Paris, and\r\nlater in Italy. She returned to Berlin, where she painted portraits and\r\ngenre subjects. Her picture of the \"Grandmother telling Stories\" is in\r\nthe Museum of Stettin. Among her works are \"An Artist's Travels\" a\r\n\"German Emigrant,\" and \"School Friends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>VONNOH, BESSIE POTTER.</b> Bronze medal, Paris Exposition, 1900; Second\r\nPrize at Tennessee Centennial.

Among her best\r\nworks are \"A Young Mother\"; \"Twin Sisters\"; \"His First Journey\"; \"Girl\r\nReading,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn the _Century Magazine_, September, 1897, Arthur Hoeber wrote: \"There\r\nwere shown at the Society of American Artists in New York, in the Spring\r\nof 1896, some statuettes of graceful young womanhood, essentially modern\r\nin conception, singularly naïve in treatment, refined, and withal\r\nintensely personal.... While the disclosure is by no means novel, Miss\r\nPotter makes us aware that in the daily prosaic life about us there are\r\npossibilities conventional yet attractive, simple, but containing much of\r\nsuggestion, waiting only the sympathetic touch to be responsive if the\r\nproper chord is struck.\"\r\n\r\nThis author also notices the affiliation of this young woman with the\r\nefforts of the Tanagra workers, and says: \"But if the inspiration of the\r\nyoung woman is evident, her work can in no way be called imitative.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>VOS, MARIA.</b> Born in Amsterdam, 1824. Pupil of P. Kiers. Her pictures\r\nwere principally of still-life, two of which are seen in the Amsterdam\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WAGNER, MARIA DOROTHEA</b>; family name Dietrich. 1728-1792. The gallery\r\nof Wiesbaden has two of her landscapes, as has also the Museum at Gotha.\r\n\"Der Mühlengrund,\" representing a valley with a brook and a mill, is in\r\nthe Dresden Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WARD, MISS E.</b> This sculptor has a commission to make a statue of G.\r\nR. Clark for the St. Louis Exposition.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WARD, HENRIETTA MARY ADA.</b> Gold and silver medals at the Crystal\r\nPalace; bronze medal at the Vienna Exposition, 1873. Born in Newman\r\nStreet, London, when that street and the neighborhood was the quarter in\r\nwhich the then celebrated artists resided. Mrs. Ward was a pupil of the\r\nBloomsbury Art School and of Sak's Academy. Her grandfather, James Ward,\r\nwas a royal Academician, and one of the best animal painters of England.\r\nWhile Sir Thomas Lawrence lived, Mrs. Ward's father, who was a\r\nminiaturist, was much occupied in copying the works of Sir Thomas on\r\nivory, as the celebrated portrait painter would permit no other artist to\r\nrepeat them. After the death of Sir Thomas, Mr. Ward became an engraver.\r\nHer mother was also a miniature painter. Her great-uncles were William\r\nWard, R.A., and George Morland; John Jackson, R.A., was her uncle; and\r\nher husband, Edward M. Ward, to whom she was married at sixteen, was also\r\na Royal Academican.\r\n\r\nFrom 1849, Mrs. Ward exhibited at the Royal Academy during thirty years,\r\nwithout a break, but her husband's death caused her to omit some\r\nexhibitions, and since that time her exhibits have been less regular. For\r\nsome years Mrs. Ward has had successful classes for women at Chester\r\nStudios, which have somewhat interfered with her painting.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ward's subjects have been historical and genre, some of which are\r\nextensively known by prints after them. Among these are \"Joan of Arc,\"\r\n\"Palissy the Potter,\" and \"Mrs. Fry and Mary Saunderson visiting\r\nPrisoners at Newgate,\" the last dedicated by permission to Queen\r\nVictoria. This picture was purchased by an American.\r\n\r\nOf her picture of \"Mary of Scotland, giving her infant to the Care of\r\nLord Mar,\" Palgrave wrote: \"This work is finely painted, and tells its\r\ntale with clearness.\" Among her numerous works are: \"The Poet Hogg's\r\nFirst Love\"; \"Chatterton,\" the poet, in the Muniment Room, Bristol; \"Lady\r\nJane Grey refusing the Crown of England\"; \"Antwerp Market\"; \"Queen Mary\r\nof Scots' farewell to James I.\"; \"Washing Day at the Liverpool Docks\";\r\n\"The Princes in the Tower\"; \"George III. and Mrs. Delayney, with his\r\nfamily at Windsor\"; \"The Young Pretender,\" and many others.\r\n\r\nWhen sixteen Mrs. Ward exhibited two heads in crayon. In 1903, at the\r\nAcademy, she exhibited \"The Dining-room, Kent House, Knightsbridge.\" Mrs.\r\nWard painted for Queen Victoria two portraits of the Princess Beatrice,\r\nand a life-size copy of a portrait of the Duke of Albany. She also\r\npainted a portrait of Princess Alice of Albany, who is about to marry\r\nPrince Alexander of Teck.\r\n\r\nEdward VII. has commissioned this artist to make two copies of the state\r\nportrait, painted by S. Luke Fildes, R.A.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ward had two more votes for her admission to the Royal Academy than\r\nany other woman of her time has had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WASSER, ANNA.</b> Born at Zürich, 1676, is notable among the painters of\r\nher country. She was the daughter of an artist, and early developed a\r\nlove of drawing and an unusual aptitude in the study of languages. In\r\npainting she was a pupil of Joseph Werner. After a time she devoted\r\nherself to miniature painting; her reputation extended to all the German\r\ncourts, as well as to Holland and England, and her commissions were so\r\nnumerous that her father began to regard her as a mine of riches. He\r\nallowed her neither rest nor recreation, and was even unwilling that she\r\nshould devote sufficient time to her pictures to finish them properly.\r\nUnder this pressure of haste and constant labor her health gave way and\r\nshe became melancholy.\r\n\r\nShe was separated from her father, and in more agreeable surroundings her\r\nhealth was restored and she resumed her painting. Her father then\r\ninsisted that she should return to him. On her journey home she had a\r\nfall, from the effects of which she died at the age of thirty-four.\r\n\r\nFuseli valued a picture by Anna Wasser, which he owned, and praised her\r\ncorrectness of design and her feeling for color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WATERS, SADIE P.</b> 1869-1900. Honorable mention Paris Exposition,\r\n1900. Born in St. Louis, Missouri. This unusually gifted artist made her\r\nstudies entirely in Paris, under the direction of M. Luc-Olivier Merson.\r\n\r\nHer earlier works were portraits in miniature, in which she was very\r\nsuccessful. That of Jane Hading was much admired. She also excelled in\r\nillustrations, but in her later work she found her true province, that of\r\nreligious subjects. A large picture on ivory, called \"La Vierge au Lys,\"\r\nwas exhibited in Paris, London, Brussels, and Ghent, and attracted much\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA VIERGE AU ROSIER\r\n\r\nSADIE WATERS]\r\n\r\nHer picture of the \"Vierge aux Rosiers,\" reproduced here, was in the\r\nSalon, 1899, and in the exhibition of Religious Art in Brussels in 1900,\r\nafter which it was exhibited in New York; and wherever seen it was\r\nespecially admired.\r\n\r\nMiss Waters' pictures were exhibited in the Salon Français, Champs\r\nElysées, from 1891 until her death. From the earliest days of childhood\r\nshe was remarkable for her skill in drawing and in working out, from\r\nher own impressions, pictures of events passing about her. If at the\r\ntheatre she saw a play that appealed to her, she made a picture symbolic\r\nof the play, and constantly startled her friends by her original ideas\r\nand the pronounced artistic temperament, which was very early the one\r\ncontrolling power in her life. Mr. Carl Gutherz thus speaks of her good\r\nfortune in studying with M. Merson.\r\n\r\n\"As the Master and Student became more and more acquainted, and the great\r\nartist found in the student those kindred qualities which subsequently\r\nmade her work so refined and beautiful,... he took the utmost care in\r\ndeveloping her drawing--the fidelity of line and of expression, and the\r\never-pervading purity in her work. The sympathy with all good was\r\nreflected in the student, as it was ever present with the master, and\r\nonly those who are acquainted with M. Merson can appreciate how fortunate\r\nit was for Art that the young artist was under a master of his character\r\nand temperament.\"\r\n\r\nOne of her pictures, called \"La Chrysanthème,\" represents a nude figure\r\nof a young girl, seated on the ground, leaning against a large basket of\r\nchrysanthemums, from which she is plucking blossoms. The figure is\r\nbeautiful, and shows the deep study the artist had made, although still\r\nso young.\r\n\r\nThe following estimate of her work is made by one competent to speak of\r\nsuch matters: \"In this epoch of feverish uncertainty, of heated\r\ndiscussions and rivalries in art matters, the quiet, calm figure of Sadie\r\nWaters has a peculiar interest and charm generated by her tranquil and\r\npersistent pursuit of an ideal--an ideal she attained in her later\r\nworks, an ideal of the highest mental order, mystical and human, and so\r\nfar removed from the tendencies of our time that one might truthfully\r\nsay, it stands alone. Her talents were manifold. She was endowed with the\r\nbest of artistic qualities. She cultivated them diligently, and slowly\r\nacquired the handicraft and skill which enabled her to express herself\r\nwithout restriction. In her miniatures she learned to be careful,\r\nprecise, and delicate; in her work from nature she was human; and in her\r\nstudies of illuminating she gained a perfect understanding of ornamental\r\npainting and forms; and the subtle ambiance of the beautiful old churches\r\nand convents where she worked and pored over the ancient missals, and\r\nsoftly talked with the princely robed Monsignori, no doubt did much to\r\ndevelop her love for the Beautiful Story, the delicate myth of\r\nChristianity--and all this, all these rare qualities and honest efforts\r\nwe find in her last picture, The Virgin.\r\n\r\n\"The beauty and preciseness of this composition, the divine feeling not\r\nwithout a touch of motherly sentiment, its delicacy so rare and so pure,\r\nthe distinction of its coloring, are all past expression, and give it a\r\nplace unique in the nineteenth century.\"--_Paul W. Bartlett_, Paris,\r\n1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WEGMANN, BERTHA.</b> Honorable mention, Paris Salon, 1880; third-class\r\nmedal, 1882; Thorwaldsen medal at Copenhagen; small gold medal, Berlin,\r\n1894. Born at Soglio, Switzerland, 1847. Studied in Copenhagen, Munich,\r\nParis, and Florence.\r\n\r\nShe paints portraits and genre subjects. Her pictures, seen at Berlin in\r\n1893, were much admired. They included portraits, figure studies, and\r\nDanish interiors. At Munich, in 1894, her portraits attracted attention,\r\nand were commended by those who wrote of the exhibition. Among her works\r\nare many portraits: \"Mother and Child in the Garden,\" and \"A Widow and\r\nChild,\" are two of her genre subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WEIS, ROSARIO.</b> Silver medal from the Academy of San Fernando, 1842,\r\nfor a picture called \"Silence.\" Member of the Academy. Pupil of Goya, who\r\nearly recognized her talent. In 1823, when Goya removed to Burdeos, she\r\nstudied under the architect Tiburcio Perez. After a time she joined Goya,\r\nand remained his pupil until his death in 1828. She then entered the\r\nstudio Lacour, where she did admirable work. In 1833, for the support of\r\nher mother and herself, she made copies of pictures in the Prado on\r\nprivate commissions.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 she was appointed teacher of drawing to the royal family, in\r\nwhich position she did not long continue, her death occurring in 1843.\r\n\r\nAmong her pictures are \"Attention!\" an allegorical figure; \"An Angel\"; \"A\r\nVenus\"; and \"A Diana.\" Among her portraits are those of Goya, Velasquez,\r\nand Figaro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WIEGMANN, MARIE ELISABETH</b>; family name Hancke.

In the Museum\r\nat Hanover is \"The Colonist's Children Crowning a Negro Woman,\" and in\r\nthe National Gallery at Berlin a portrait of Schnaase. Some children's\r\nportraits, and one of the Countess Hatzfeld, should also be mentioned\r\namong her works.\r\n\r\nIn portraiture her work was distinguished by talent, spirit, and true\r\nartistic composition; in genre--especially the so-called ideal genre--she\r\nproduced some exquisite examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WENTWORTH, MARQUISE CECILIA DE.</b> Gold medal, Tours National\r\nExposition, Lyons and Turin; Honorable mention, Paris Salon, 1891; Bronze\r\nmedal, Paris Exposition, 1900; Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, 1901.\r\nBorn in New York.

Honorable mention, Paris\r\nSalon, 1897. Born in Cincinnati, 1875. Pupil of Cincinnati Art Museum,\r\nunder Louis T. Rebisso and Thomas Noble; in Paris, of Rodin and Vincent\r\nNorrottny.\r\n\r\nBy special invitation this sculptor has been an exhibitor at the National\r\nSculpture Society, New York. Her principal works are: \"The Minute Man,\"\r\nin Corcoran Art Gallery, Washington, D. C.; \"The Volunteer,\" which was\r\ngiven by the State of New York as a military prize to a Vermont Regiment;\r\nan equestrian statue of John F. Doyle, Jr.; \"Bull and Bear\" and the \"Polo\r\nPlayer\" in bronze, owned by Tiffany & Co.; \"Retribution\" in a private\r\ncollection in New York.\r\n\r\nMiss Wilson has been accorded the largest commission given any woman\r\nsculptor for the decoration of the buildings of the St. Louis Exposition.\r\nShe is to design eight spandrils for Machinery Hall, each one being\r\ntwenty-eight by fifteen feet in size, with figures larger than life. The\r\ndesign represents the wheelwright and boiler-making trades. Reclining\r\nnude figures, of colossal size, bend toward the keystone of the arch,\r\neach holding a tool of a machinist. Interlaced cog-wheels form the\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WIRTH, ANNA MARIE.</b> Member of the Munich Art Association. Born in St.\r\nPetersburg, 1846. Studied in Vienna under Straschiripka--commonly known\r\nas Johann Canon--and in Paris, although her year's work in the latter\r\ncity seems to have left no trace upon her manner of painting. The genre\r\npictures, in which she excels, clearly show the influence of the old\r\nDutch school. A writer in \"Moderne Kunst\" says, in general, that she\r\nshows us real human beings under the \"précieuses ridicules,\" the\r\nlanguishing gallants and the pedant, and often succeeds in\r\nindividualizing all these with the sharpness of a Chodowiecki, though at\r\ntimes she is merely good-natured, and therefore weak.\r\n\r\nSometimes, like Terborch, by her anecdotical treatment, she can set a\r\nwhole romantic story before you; again, in the manner of Gerard Dow, she\r\ngives you a penetrating glimpse into old burgher life--work that is quite\r\nout of touch with the dilettantism that largely pervades modern art.\r\n\r\nThe admirers of this unusual artist seek out her genre pictures in the\r\nexhibitions of to-day, much as one turns to an idyl of Heinrich Voss,\r\nafter a dose of the \"storm and stress\" poets. Most of her works are in\r\nprivate galleries.\r\n\r\nOne of her best pictures will be seen at the St. Louis Exposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WISINGER-FLORIAN, OLGA.</b> Bavarian Ludwig medal, 1891; medal at\r\nChicago, 1893. Born in Vienna, 1844. Pupil of Schäffer and Schwindler.\r\nShe has an excellent reputation as a painter of flowers. In the New\r\nGallery, Munich, is one of her pictures of this sort; and at Munich,\r\n1893, her flower pieces were especially praised in the reports of the\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\nShe also paints landscapes, in which she gains power each year; her color\r\ngrows finer and her design or modelling stronger. At Vienna, 1890, it was\r\nsaid that her picture of the \"Bauernhofe\" was, by its excellent color, a\r\ndisadvantage to the pictures near it, and the shore motive in \"Abbazia\"\r\nwas full of artistic charm. At Vienna, 1893, she exhibited a cycle, \"The\r\nMonths,\" which bore witness to her admirable mastery of her art.\r\n\r\nAmong her works are some excellent Venetian subjects: \"On the Rialto\";\r\n\"Morning on the Shore\"; and \"In Venice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WOLFF, BETTY.</b> Honorable mention, Berlin, 1890. Member of the\r\nAssociation of Women Artists and Friends of Art; also of the German Art\r\nAssociation. Born in Berlin, where she was a pupil of Karl Stauffer-Bern;\r\nshe also studied in Munich under Karl Marr.\r\n\r\nBesides numerous portraits of children, in pastel, this artist has\r\npainted portraits in oils of many well-known persons, among whom are\r\nProf. H. Steinthal, Prof. Albrecht Weber, and General von Zycklinski.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WOLTERS, HENRIETTA</b>, family name Van Pee. Born in Amsterdam.\r\n1692-1741. Pupil of her father, and later made a special study of\r\nminiature under Christoffel le Blond. Her early work consisted largely in\r\ncopies from Van de Velde and Van Dyck. Her miniatures were so highly\r\nesteemed that Peter the Great offered her a salary of six thousand\r\nflorins as his court painter; and Frederick William of Prussia invited\r\nher to his court, but nothing could tempt her away from her home in\r\nAmsterdam. She received four hundred florins for a single miniature, a\r\nmost unusual price in her time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WOOD, CAROLINE S.</b> Daughter of Honorable Horatio D. Wood, of St.\r\nLouis. This sculptor has made unusual advances in her art, to which she\r\nhas seriously devoted herself less than four years. She has studied in\r\nthe Art School of Washington University, the Art Institute, Chicago, and\r\nis now a student in the Art League, New York.\r\n\r\nShe has been commissioned by the State of Missouri to make a statue to\r\nrepresent \"The Spirit of the State of Missouri,\" for the Louisiana\r\nPurchase Exposition.\r\n\r\n[_No reply to circular_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WOODBURY, MARCIA OAKES.</b> Prize at Boston Art Club; medals at\r\nMechanics' Association Exhibition, Atlanta and Nashville Expositions.\r\nMember of the New York and Boston Water-Color Clubs.

PATIENCE.</b> Born at Bordentown, New Jersey, 1725, of a\r\nQuaker family. When left a widow, with three children to care for, she\r\nwent to London, where she found a larger field for her art than she had\r\nin the United States, where she had already made a good reputation as a\r\nmodeller in wax. By reason of this change of residence she has often been\r\ncalled an English sculptress.\r\n\r\nAlthough the imaginative and pictorial is not cultivated or even approved\r\nby Quakers, Patience Lovell, while still a child, and before she had seen\r\nworks of art, was content only when supplied with dough, wax, or clay,\r\nfrom which she made figures of men and women. Very early these figures\r\nbecame portraits of the people she knew best, and in the circle of her\r\nfamily and friends she was considered a genius.\r\n\r\nVery soon after Mrs. Wright reached London she was fully employed. She\r\nworked in wax, and her full-length portrait of Lord Chatham was placed in\r\nWestminster Abbey, protected by a glass case. This attracted much\r\nattention, and the London journals praised the artist. She made portraits\r\nof the King and Queen, who, attracted by her brilliant conversation,\r\nadmitted her to an intimacy at Buckingham House, which could not then\r\nhave been accorded to an untitled English woman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From a Copley Print.\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF AGES\r\n\r\nETHEL WRIGHT]\r\n\r\nMrs. Wright made many portraits of distinguished people; but few, if any,\r\nof these can now be seen, although it is said that some of them have been\r\ncarefully preserved by the families who possess them.\r\n\r\nTo Americans Mrs. Wright is interesting by reason of her patriotism,\r\nwhich amounted to a passion. She is credited with having been an\r\nimportant source of information to the American leaders in the time of\r\nthe Revolution. In this she was frank and courageous, making no secret of\r\nher views. She even ventured to reprove George III. for his attitude\r\ntoward the Colonists, and by this boldness lost the royal favor.\r\n\r\nShe corresponded with Franklin, in Paris, and new appointments, or other\r\nimportant movements in the British army, were speedily known to him.\r\n\r\nWashington, when he knew that Mrs. Wright wished to make a bust of him,\r\nreplied in most flattering terms that he should think himself happy to\r\nhave his portrait made by her. Mrs. Wright very much desired to make\r\nlikenesses of those who signed the Treaty of Peace, and of those who had\r\ntaken a prominent part in making it. She wrote: \"To shame the English\r\nking, I would go to any trouble and expense, and add my mite to the\r\nhonor due to Adams, Jefferson, and others.\"\r\n\r\nThough so essentially American as a woman, the best of her professional\r\nlife was passed in England, where she was liberally patronized and fully\r\nappreciated. Dunlap calls her an extraordinary woman, and several writers\r\nhave mentioned her power of judging the character of her visitors, in\r\nwhich she rarely made a mistake, and chose her friends with unusual\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nHer eldest daughter married in America, and was well known as a modeller\r\nin wax in New York. Her younger daughter married the artist Hoppner, a\r\nrival in portraiture of Stuart and Lawrence, while her son Joseph was a\r\nportrait painter. His likeness of Washington was much admired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WULFRAAT, MARGARETTA.</b> Born at Arnheim. 1678-1741. Was a pupil of\r\nCaspar Netscher of Heidelberg, whose little pictures are of fabulous\r\nvalue. Although he was so excellent a painter he was proud of Margaretta,\r\nwhose pictures were much admired in her day. Her \"Musical Conversation\"\r\nis in the Museum of Schwerin. Her \"Cleopatra\" and \"Semiramis\" are in the\r\nGallery at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>YANDELL, ENID.</b> Special Designer's Medal, Chicago, 1893; silver\r\nmedal, Tennessee Exposition; Honorable Mention, Buffalo, 1901. Member of\r\nNational Sculpture Society; Municipal Art Society; National Arts Club,\r\nall of New York. Born in Louisville, Kentucky. Graduate of Cincinnati Art\r\nAcademy. Pupil of Philip Martiny in New York, and in Paris of Frederick\r\nMcMonnies and Auguste Rodin.\r\n\r\nThe principal works of this artist are the Mayor Lewis monument at New\r\nHaven, Connecticut; the Chancellor Garland Memorial, Vanderbilt\r\nUniversity, Nashville; Carrie Brown Memorial Fountain, Providence; Daniel\r\nBoone and the Ruff Fountain, Louisville.\r\n\r\nRichard Ladegast, in January, 1902, wrote a sketch of Miss Yandell's life\r\nand works for the _Outlook_, in which he says that Miss Yandell was the\r\nfirst woman to become a member of the National Sculpture Society. I quote\r\nfrom his article as follows: \"The most imposing product of Miss Yandell's\r\ngenius was the heroic figure of Athena, twenty-five feet in height, which\r\nstood in front of the reproduction of the Parthenon at the Nashville\r\nExposition. This is the largest figure ever designed by a woman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF DANIEL BOONE\r\n\r\nENID YANDELL\r\n\r\nMade for St. Louis Exposition]\r\n\r\n\"The most artistic was probably the little silver tankard which she did\r\nfor the Tiffany Company, a bit of modelling which involves the figures of\r\na fisher-boy and a mermaid. The figure of Athena is large and correct;\r\nthose of the fisher-boy and mermaid poetic and impassioned.... The boy\r\nkisses the maid when the lid is lifted. He is always looking over the\r\nedge, as if yearning for the fate that each new drinker who lifts the lid\r\nforces upon him.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Carrie Brown Memorial Fountain he says: \"The design of the\r\nfountain represents the struggle of life symbolized by a group of figures\r\nwhich is intended to portray, according to Miss Yandell, not the struggle\r\nfor bare existence, but 'the attempt of the immortal soul within us to\r\nfree itself from the handicaps and entanglements of its earthly\r\nenvironments. It is the development of character, the triumph of\r\nintellectuality and spirituality I have striven to express.' Life is\r\nsymbolized by the figure of a woman, the soul by an angel, and the\r\nearthly tendencies--duty, passion, and avarice--by male figures. Life is\r\nrepresented as struggling to free herself from the gross earthly forms\r\nthat cling to her. The figure of Life shows a calm, placid strength, well\r\ncalculated to conquer in a struggle; and the modelling of her clinging\r\nrobes and the active muscle of the male figures is firm and life-like.\r\nThe mantle of truth flows from the shoulders of the angel, forming a\r\ndrapery for the whole group, and serving as a support for the basin, the\r\nedges of which are ornamented with dolphins spouting water.\r\n\r\n\"The silhouette formed by the mass of the fountain is most interesting\r\nand successful from all points of view. The lines of the composition are\r\nlarge and dignified, especially noticeable in the modelling of the\r\nindividual figures, which is well studied and technically excellent.\"\r\n\r\nAt Buffalo, where this fountain was exhibited, it received honorable\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nMiss Yandell has been commissioned to execute a symbolical figure of\r\nvictory and a statue of Daniel Boone for the St. Louis Exposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>YKENS, LAURENCE CATHERINE.</b> Elected to the Guild of Antwerp in 1659.\r\nBorn in Antwerp. Pupil of her father, Jan Ykens. Flowers, fruits, and\r\ninsects were her favorite subjects, and were painted with rare delicacy.\r\nTwo of these pictures are in the Museo del Prado, at Madrid. They are a\r\n\"Festoon of Flowers and Fruits with a Medallion in the Centre, on which\r\nis a Landscape\"; and a \"Garland of Flowers with a Similar Medallion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ZIESENSIS, MARGARETTA.</b> There were few women artists in the\r\nScandinavian countries in the early years of the eighteenth century.\r\nAmong them was Margaretta Ziesensis, a Danish lady, who painted a large\r\nnumber of portraits and some historical subjects.\r\n\r\nShe was best known, however, for her miniature copies of the works of\r\nfamous artists. These pictures were much the same in effect as the\r\n\"picture-miniatures\" now in vogue. Her copy of Correggio's Zingarella was\r\nmuch admired, and was several times repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT\r\n\r\nContaining names previously omitted and additions. The asterisk (*)\r\ndenotes preceding mention of the artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*<b>BILDERS, MARIE VAN BOSSE.</b> This celebrated landscape painter became\r\nan artist through her determination to be an artist rather than because\r\nof any impelling natural force driving her to this career.\r\n\r\nAfter patient and continuous toil, she felt that she was developing an\r\nartistic impulse. The advice of Van de Sande-Bakhuyzen greatly encouraged\r\nher, and the candid and friendly criticism of Bosboom inspired her with\r\nthe courage to exhibit her work in public.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1875, in Vorden, she met Johannes Bilders, under whose\r\ndirection she studied landscape painting. This master took great pains to\r\ndevelop the originality of his pupil rather than to encourage her\r\nadapting the manner of other artists. During her stay in Vorden she made\r\na distinct gain in the attainment of an individual style of painting.\r\n\r\nAfter her return to her home at The Hague, Bilders established a studio\r\nthere and showed a still keener interest in his pupil. This artistic\r\nfriendship resulted in the marriage of the two artists, and in 1880 they\r\nestablished themselves in Oosterbeck.\r\n\r\nHere began the intimate study of the heath which so largely influenced\r\nthe best pictures by Frau Bilders. In the garden of the picturesque house\r\nin which the two artists lived was an old barn, which became her studio,\r\nwhere, early and late, in all sorts of weather, she devotedly observed\r\nthe effects later pictured on her canvases. At this time she executed one\r\nof her best works, now in the collection of the Prince Regent of\r\nBrunswick. It is thus described by a Dutch writer in Rooses' \"Dutch\r\nPainters of the Nineteenth Century\":\r\n\r\n\"It represents a deep pool, overshadowed by old gnarled willows in their\r\nautumnal foliage, their silvery trunks bending over, as if to see\r\nthemselves in the clear, still water. On the edge of the pool are flowers\r\nand variegated grasses, the latter looking as if they wished to crowd out\r\nthe former--as if _they_ were in the right and the flowers in the wrong;\r\nas if such bright-hued creatures had no business to eclipse their more\r\nsombre tones; as if _they_ and _they_ alone were suited to this silent,\r\nforsaken spot.\"\r\n\r\nJohannes Bilders was fully twenty-five years older than his wife, and the\r\nfailure of both his physical and mental powers in his last days required\r\nher absolute devotion to him. In spite of this, the garden studio was not\r\nwholly forsaken, and nearly every day she accomplished something there.\r\nAfter her husband's death she had a long illness. On her recovery she\r\nreturned to The Hague and took the studio which had been that of the\r\nartist Mauve.\r\n\r\nThe life of the town was wearisome to her, but she found a compensation\r\nin her re-union with her old friends, and with occasional visits to the\r\nheath she passed most of her remaining years in the city.\r\n\r\nHer favorite subjects were landscapes with birch and beech trees, and the\r\nvarying phases of the heath and of solitary and unfrequented scenes. Her\r\nworks are all in private collections. Among them are \"The Forester's\r\nCottage,\" \"Autumn in Doorwerth,\" \"The Old Birch,\" and the \"Old Oaks of\r\nWodan at Sunset.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>BOZNANSKA, OLGA.</b> Born in Cracow, where she was a pupil of Matejko.\r\nLater, in Munich, she studied with Kricheldorf and Dürr. Her mother was a\r\nFrench woman, and critics trace both Polish and French characteristics in\r\nher work.\r\n\r\nShe paints portraits and genre subjects. She is skilful in seizing\r\nsalient characteristics, and her chief aim is to preserve the\r\nindividuality of her sitters and models. She skilfully manages the\r\nside-lights, and by this means produces strong effects. After the first\r\nexhibition of her pictures in Berlin, her \"God-given talent\" was several\r\ntimes mentioned by the art critics.\r\n\r\nAt Munich she made a good impression by her pictures exhibited in 1893\r\nand 1895; at the Exposition in Paris, 1889, her portrait and a study in\r\npastel were much admired and were generously praised in the art journals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*<b>COX, LOUISE.</b> The picture by Mrs. Cox, reproduced in this book,\r\nillustrates two lines in a poem by Austin Dobson, called \"A Song of\r\nAngiola in Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Then set I lips to hers, and felt,--\r\n    Ah, God,--the hard pain fade and melt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>DE MORGAN, EMILY.</b> Family name Pickering. When sixteen years old,\r\nthis artist entered the Slade School, and eighteen months later received\r\nthe Slade Scholarship, by which she was entitled to benefit for three\r\nyears. At the end of the first year, however, she resigned this privilege\r\nbecause she did not wish to accept the conditions of the gift.\r\n\r\nAs a child she had loved the pictures of the precursors of Raphael, in\r\nthe National Gallery, and her first exhibited picture, \"Ariadne in\r\nNaxos,\" hung in the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877, proved how closely she had\r\nstudied these old masters. At this time she knew nothing of the English\r\nPre-Raphaelites; later, however, she became one of the most worthy\r\nfollowers of Burne-Jones.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that she left the Slade School one of her uncles took up\r\nhis residence in Florence, where she has spent several winters in work\r\nand study.\r\n\r\nOne of her most important pictures is inscribed with these lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Dark is the valley of shadows,\r\n    Empty the power of kings;\r\n    Blind is the favor of fortune,\r\n    Hungry the caverns of death.\r\n    Dim is the light from beyond,\r\n    Unanswered the riddle of life.\"\r\n\r\nThis pessimistic view of the world is illustrated by the figure of a\r\nking, who, in the midst of ruins, places his foot upon the prostrate form\r\nof a chained victim; Happiness, with bandaged eyes, scatters treasures\r\ninto the bottomless pit, a desperate youth being about to plunge into its\r\ndepths; a kneeling woman, praying for light, sees brilliant figures\r\nsoaring upward, their beauty charming roses from the thorn bushes.\r\n\r\nOther pictures by this artist remind one of the works of Botticelli. Of\r\nher \"Ithuriel\" W. S. Sparrow wrote: \"It may be thought that this Ithuriel\r\nis too mild--too much like Shakespeare's Oberon--to be in keeping with\r\nthe terrific tragedy depicted in the first four books of the 'Paradise\r\nLost.' Eve, too, lovely as she is, seems to bear no likelihood of\r\nresemblance to Milton's superb mother of mankind. But the picture has a\r\nsweet, serene grace which should make us glad to accept from Mrs. De\r\nMorgan another Eve and another Ithuriel, true children of her own fancy.\"\r\n\r\nThe myth of \"Boreas and Orithyia,\" though faulty perhaps in technique, is\r\ngood in conception and arrangement.\r\n\r\nMrs. De Morgan has produced some impressive works in sculpture. Among\r\nthese are \"Medusa,\" a bronze bust; and a \"Mater Dolorosa,\" in\r\nterra-cotta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>DESCHLY, IRENE.</b> Born in Bucharest, the daughter of a Roumanian\r\nadvocate. She gave such promise as an artist that a government stipend\r\nwas bestowed on her, which enabled her to study in Paris, where she was a\r\npupil of Laurens and E. Carrière.\r\n\r\nHer work is tinged with the melancholy and intensity of her\r\nnature--perhaps of her race; yet there is something in her grim\r\nconceptions, or rather in her treatment of them, that demands attention\r\nand compels admiration. Even in her \"Sweet Dream,\" which represents the\r\nhalf-nude figure of a young girl holding a rose in her hand, there is\r\nmore sadness than joy, as though she said, \"It is only a dream, after\r\nall.\" \"Chanson,\" exhibited at the Paris Exposition, 1900, displays\r\nsomething of the same quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ERISTOW-KASAK, PRINCESS MARIE.</b> Among the many Russian portraits in\r\nthe Paris Exposition, 1900, two, the work of this pupil of Michel de\r\nZichys, stood out in splendid contrast with the crass realism or the weak\r\nidealism of the greater number. One was a half-length portrait of the\r\nlaughing Mme. Paquin; full of life and movement were the pose of the\r\nfigure, the fall of the draperies, and the tilt of the expressive fan.\r\nThe other was the spirited portrait of Baron von Friedericks, a happy\r\ncombination of cavalier and soldier in its manly strength.\r\n\r\nWhen but sixteen years old, the Princess Marie roused the admiration of\r\nthe Russian court by her portrait of the Grand Duke Sergius. This led to\r\nher painting portraits of various members of the royal family while she\r\nwas still a pupil of De Zichys.\r\n\r\nAfter her marriage she established herself in Paris, where she endeavors\r\nto preserve an incognito as an artist in order to work in the most quiet\r\nand devoted manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>GOEBELER, ELISE.</b> This artist studied drawing under Steffeck and\r\ncolor under Dürr, in Munich. Connoisseurs in art welcome the name of\r\nElise Goebeler in exhibitions, and recall the remarkable violet-blue\r\nlights and the hazy atmosphere in her works, out of which emerges some\r\ncharming, graceful figure; perhaps a young girl on whose white shoulders\r\nthe light falls, while a shadow half conceals the rest of the form.\r\nThese dreamy, Madonna-like beauties are the result of the most severe and\r\nprotracted study. Without the remarkable excellence of their technique\r\nand the unusual quality of their color they would be the veriest\r\nsentimentalities; but wherever they are seen they command admiration.\r\n\r\nHer \"Cinderella,\" exhibited in Berlin in 1880, was bought by the Emperor;\r\nanother picture of the same subject, but quite different in effect, was\r\nexhibited in Munich in 1883. In the same year, in Berlin, \"A Young Girl\r\nwith Pussy-Willows\" and \"A Neapolitan Water Carrier\" were seen. In 1887,\r\nin Berlin, her \"Vanitas, Vanitatum Vanitas\" and the \"Net-Mender\" were\r\nexhibited, and ten years later \"Cheerfulness\" was highly commended. At\r\nMunich, in 1899, her picture, called \"Elegie,\" attracted much attention\r\nand received unusual praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*<b>HERBELIN, JEANE MATHILDE.</b> This miniaturist has recently died at the\r\nage of eighty-four. In addition to the medals and honors she had received\r\nprevious to 1855, it was that year decided that her works should be\r\nadmitted to the Salon without examination. She was a daughter of General\r\nHabert, and a niece of Belloc, under whom she studied her art while still\r\nvery young. Her early ambition was to paint large pictures, but Delacroix\r\npersuaded her to devote herself to miniature painting, in which art she\r\nhas been called \"the best in the world.\"\r\n\r\nShe adopted the full tones and broad style to which she was accustomed in\r\nher larger works, and revolutionized the method of miniature painting in\r\nwhich stippling had prevailed. When eighteen years old, she went to\r\nItaly, where she made copies from the masters and did much original work\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nAmong her best portraits are those of the Baroness Habert, Guizot,\r\nRossini, Isabey, Robert-Fleury, M. and Mme. de Torigny, Count de Zeppel,\r\nand her own portrait. Besides portraits, she painted a picture called \"A\r\nChild Holding a Rose,\" \"Souvenir,\" and \"A Young Girl Playing with a Fan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>JOHNSON, ADELAIDE.</b> Born at Plymouth, Illinois. This sculptor first\r\nstudied in the St. Louis School of Design, and in 1877, at the St. Louis\r\nExposition, received two prizes for the excellence of her wood carving.\r\nDuring several years she devoted herself to interior decoration,\r\ndesigning not only the form and color to be used in decorating edifices,\r\nbut also the furniture and all necessary details to complete them and\r\nmake them ready for use.\r\n\r\nBeing desirous of becoming a sculptor, Miss Johnson went, in 1883, to\r\nEngland, Germany, and Italy. In Rome she was a pupil of Monteverde and of\r\nAltini, who was then president of the Academy of St. Luke.\r\n\r\nAfter two years she returned to America and began her professional career\r\nin Chicago, where she remained but a year before establishing herself in\r\nWashington. Her best-known works are portrait busts, which are numerous.\r\nMany of these have been seen in the Corcoran Art Gallery and in other\r\npublic exhibitions.\r\n\r\nOf her bust of Susan B. Anthony, the sculptor, Lorado Taft, said: \"Your\r\nbust of Miss Anthony is better than mine. I tried to make her real, but\r\nyou have made her not only real, but ideal.\" Among her portraits are\r\nthose of General Logan, Dr. H. W. Thomas, Isabella Beecher Hooker,\r\nWilliam Tebb, Esq., of London, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KOEGEL, LINDA.</b> Born at The Hague. A pupil of Stauffer-Bern in Berlin\r\nand of Herterich in Munich. Her attachment to impressionism leads this\r\nartist to many experiments in color--or, as one critic wrote, \"to play\r\nwith color.\"\r\n\r\nShe apparently prefers to paint single figures of women and young girls,\r\nbut her works include a variety of subjects. She also practises etching,\r\npen-and-ink drawing, as well as crayon and water-color sketching. The\r\nlight touch in some of her genre pictures is admirable, and in contrast,\r\nthe portrait of her father--- the court preacher--displays a masculine\r\nfirmness in its handling, and is a very striking picture.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 she exhibited at the Munich Secession the portrait of a woman,\r\ndelicate but spirited, and a group which was said to set aside every\r\nconvention in the happiest manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>KROENER, MAGDA.</b> The pictures of flowers which this artist paints\r\nprove her to be a devoted lover of nature. She exhibited at Düsseldorf,\r\nin 1893, a captivating study of red poppies and another of flowering\r\nvetch, which were bought by the German Emperor. The following year she\r\nexhibited two landscapes, one of which was so much better than the other\r\nthat it was suggested that she might have been assisted by her husband,\r\nthe animal painter, Christian Kroener.\r\n\r\nOne of her most delightful pictures, \"A Quiet Corner,\" represents a\r\nretired nook in a garden, overgrown with foliage and flowers, so well\r\npainted that one feels that they must be fragrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>LEPSIUS, SABINA.</b> Daughter of Gustav Graf and wife of the portrait\r\npainter, Lepsius. She was a pupil of Gussow, then of the Julian Academy\r\nin Paris, and later studied in Rome. Her pictures have an unusual\r\nrefinement; like some other German women artists, she aims at giving a\r\nsubtle impression of character and personality in her treatment of\r\nexternals, and her work has been said to affect one like music.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of her little daughter, painted in a manner which suggests\r\nVan Dyck, is one of the works which entitle her to consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>LEYSTER, JUDITH.</b> A native of Haarlem on Zandam, the date of her\r\nbirth being unknown. She died in 1660. In 1636 she married the well-known\r\nartist, Jan Molemaer. She did her work at a most interesting period in\r\nDutch painting. Her earliest picture is dated 1629; she was chosen to the\r\nGuild of St. Luke at Haarlem in 1633.\r\n\r\nRecent investigations make it probable that certain pictures which have\r\nfor generations been attributed to Frans Hals were the work of Judith\r\nLeyster. In 1893 a most interesting lawsuit, which occurred in London and\r\nwas reported in the _Times_, concerned a picture known as \"The Fiddlers,\"\r\nwhich had been sold as a work of Frans Hals for £4,500. The purchasers\r\nfound that this claim was not well founded, and sought to recover their\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nA searching investigation traced the ownership of the work back to a\r\nconnoisseur of the time of William III. In 1678 it was sold for a small\r\nsum, and was then called \"A Dutch Courtesan Drinking with a Young Man.\"\r\nThe monogram on the picture was called that of Frans Hals, but as\r\nreproduced and explained by C. Hofstede de Groot in the \"_Jahrbuch für\r\nKöniglich-preussischen Kunst-Sammlungen_\" for 1893, it seems evident that\r\nthe signature is J. L. and not F. H.\r\n\r\nSimilar initials are on the \"Flute Player,\" in the gallery at Stockholm;\r\nthe \"Seamstress,\" in The Hague Gallery, and on a picture in the Six\r\ncollection at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that these pictures all show the influence of Hals,\r\nwhose pupil Judith Leyster may have been, and whose manner she caught as\r\nMlle. Mayer caught that of Greuze and Prud'hon. At all events, the\r\npresent evidence seems to support the claim that the world is indebted to\r\nJudith Leyster for these admirable pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MACH, HILDEGARDE VON.</b> This painter studied in Dresden and Munich,\r\nand under the influence of Anton Pepinos she developed her best\r\ncharacteristics, her fine sense of form and of color. She admirably\r\nillustrates the modern tendency in art toward individual expression--a\r\ntendency which permits the following of original methods, and affords an\r\noutlet for energy and strength of temperament.\r\n\r\nFräulein Mach has made a name in both portrait and genre painting. Her\r\n\"Waldesgrauen\" represents two naked children in an attitude of alarm as\r\nthe forest grows dark around them; it gives a vivid impression of the\r\nmysterious charm and the possible dangers which the deep woods present\r\nto the childish mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MAYER, MARIE FRANÇOISE CONSTANCE.</b> As early as 1806 this artist\r\nreceived a gold medal from the Paris Salon, awarded to her picture of\r\n\"Venus and Love Asleep.\" Born 1775, died 1821. She studied under Suvée,\r\nGreuze, and Prud'hon. There are various accounts of the life of Mlle.\r\nMayer. That of M. Charles Guenllette is the authority followed here. It\r\nis probable that Mlle. Mayer came under the influence of Prud'hon as\r\nearly as 1802, possibly before that time.\r\n\r\nPrud'hon, a sensitive man, absorbed in his art, had married at twenty a\r\nwoman who had no sympathy with his ideals, and when she realized that he\r\nhad no ambition, and was likely to be always poor, her temper got the\r\nbetter of any affection she had ever felt for him. Prud'hon, in\r\nhumiliation and despair, lived in a solitude almost complete.\r\n\r\nIt was with difficulty that Mlle. Mayer persuaded this master to receive\r\nher as a pupil; but this being gained, both these painters had studios in\r\nthe Sorbonne from 1809 to 1821. At the latter date all artists were\r\nobliged to vacate the Sorbonne ateliers to make room for some new\r\ndepartment of instruction. Mlle. Mayer had been for some time in a\r\ndepressed condition, and her friends had been anxious about her. Whether\r\nleaving the Sorbonne had a tendency to increase her melancholy is not\r\nknown, but her suicide came as a great surprise and shock to all who knew\r\nher, especially to Prud'hon, who survived her less than two years.\r\n\r\nPrud'hon painted several portraits of Mlle. Mayer, the best-known being\r\nnow in the Louvre. It represents an engaging personality, in which\r\nvivacity and sensibility are distinctly indicated.\r\n\r\nMlle. Mayer had made her début at the Salon of 1896 with a portrait of\r\n\"Citizeness Mayer,\" painted by herself, and showing a sketch for the\r\nportrait of her mother; also a picture of a \"Young Scholar with a\r\nPortfolio Under His Arm,\" and a miniature. From this time her work was\r\nseen at each year's salon.\r\n\r\nHer pictures in 1810 were the \"Happy Mother\" and the \"Unhappy Mother,\"\r\nwhich are now in the Louvre; the contrast between the joyousness of the\r\nmother with her child and the anguish of the mother who has lost her\r\nchild is portrayed with great tenderness. The \"Dream of Happiness,\" also\r\nin the Louvre, represents a young couple in a boat with their child; the\r\nboat is guided down the stream of life by Love and Fortune. This is one\r\nof her best pictures. It is full of poetic feeling, and the flesh tints\r\nare unusually natural. The work of this artist is characterized by\r\ndelicacy of touch and freshness of color while pervaded by a peculiar\r\ngrace and charm. Her drawing is good, but the composition is less\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Prud'hon and his pupil painted many pictures in\r\ncollaboration. This has led to an under-valuation of her ability, and\r\nboth the inferior works of Prud'hon and bad imitations of him have been\r\nattributed to her. M. Guenllette writes that when Mlle. Mayer studied\r\nunder Greuze she painted in his manner, and he inclines to the opinion\r\nthat some pictures attributed to Greuze were the work of his pupil. In\r\nthe same way she imitated Prud'hon, and this critic thinks it by no means\r\ncertain that the master finished her work, as has been alleged.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum at Nancy are Mlle. Mayer's portraits of Mme. and Mlle.\r\nVoiant; in the Museum of Dijon is an ideal head by her, and in the\r\nBordeaux Gallery is her picture, called \"Confidence.\" \"Innocence Prefers\r\nLove to Riches\" and the \"Torch of Venus\" are well-known works by Mlle.\r\nMayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MESDAG-VAN HOUTEN, S.</b> Gold medal at Amsterdam, 1884; bronze medal,\r\nParis Exposition, 1889. Born at Groningen, 1834. In 1856 she married\r\nMesdag, who, rather late in life decided to follow the career of a\r\npainter. His wife, not wishing to be separated from him in any sense,\r\nresolved on the same profession, and about 1870 they began their study.\r\nMme. Mesdag acquired her technique with difficulty, and her success was\r\nachieved only as the result of great perseverance and continual labor.\r\nThe artists of Oosterbeck and Brussels, who were her associates,\r\nmaterially aided her by their encouragement. She began the study of\r\ndrawing at the age of thirty, and her first attempt in oils was made\r\nseven years later. Beginning with single twigs and working over them\r\npatiently she at length painted whole trees, and later animals. She came\r\nto know the peculiarities of nearly all native trees.\r\n\r\nShe built a studio in the woods of Scheveningen, and there developed her\r\ncharacteristics--close observation and careful reproduction of details.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1872 M. and Mme. Mesdag went to Friesland and Drenthe,\r\nwhere they made numerous sketches of the heath, sheep, farmhouses, and\r\nthe people in their quaint costumes. One of Mme. Mesdag's pictures,\r\nafterward exhibited at Berlin, is thus described: \"On this canvas we see\r\nthe moon, just as she has broken through a gray cloud, spreading her\r\nsilvery sheen over the sleepy land; in the centre we are given a\r\nsheep-fold, at the door of which a flock of sheep are jostling and\r\npushing each other, all eager to enter their place of rest. The wave-like\r\nmovement of these animals is particularly graceful and cleverly done. A\r\nlittle shepherdess is guiding them, as anxious to get them in as they are\r\nto enter, for this means the end of her day's work. Her worn-out blue\r\npetticoat is lighted up by a moonbeam; in her hand she appears to have a\r\nhoe. It is a most harmonious picture; every line is in accord with its\r\nneighbor.\"\r\n\r\nWhile residing in Brussels these two artists began to collect works of\r\nart for what is now known as the Mesdag Museum. In 1887 a wing was added\r\nto their house to accommodate their increasing treasures, which include\r\nespecially good examples of modern French painting, pottery, tapestry,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 an exhibition of the works of these painters was held. Here\r\nconvincing proof was given of Mme. Mesdag's accuracy, originality of\r\ninterpretation, and her skill in the use of color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MÖLLER, AGNES SLOTT, OR SLOTT-MÖLLER, AGNES.</b> This artist follows the\r\nyoung romantic movement in Denmark. She has embodied in her work a modern\r\ncomprehension of old legends. The landscape and people of her native\r\nland seem to her as eminently suitable motives, and these realities she\r\nrenders in the spirit of a by-gone age--that of the national heroes of\r\nthe sagas and epics of the country, or the lyric atmosphere of the\r\nfolk-songs.\r\n\r\nShe may depict these conceptions, full of feeling, in the dull colors of\r\nthe North, or in rich and glowing hues, but the impression she gives is\r\nmuch the same in both cases, a generally restful effect, though the faces\r\nin her pictures are full of life and emotion. Her choice of subjects and\r\nher manner of treatment almost inevitably introduce some archaic quality\r\nin her work. This habit and the fact that she cares more for color than\r\nfor drawing are the usual criticisms of her pictures.\r\n\r\nHer \"St. Agnes\" is an interesting rendering of a well-worn subject.\r\n\"Adelil the Proud,\" exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1889, tells the\r\nstory of the Duke of Frydensburg, who was in love with Adelil, the king's\r\ndaughter. The king put him to death, and the attendants of Adelil made of\r\nhis heart a viand which they presented to her. When she learned what this\r\nsingular substance was--that caused her to tremble violently--she asked\r\nfor wine, and carrying the cup to her lips with a tragic gesture, in\r\nmemory of her lover, she died of a broken heart. It is such legends as\r\nthese that Mme. Slott-Möller revives, and by which she is widely known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MORISOT OR MORIZOT, BERTHE.</b> Married name Manet. Born at Bourges,\r\n1840, died in Paris, 1895. A pupil of Guichard and Oudinot. After her\r\nmarriage to Eugène Manet she came under the influence of his famous\r\nbrother, Édouard. This artist signed her pictures with her maiden name,\r\nbeing too modest to use that which she felt belonged only to Édouard\r\nManet, in the world of art.\r\n\r\nA great interest was, however, aroused in the private galleries, where\r\nthe works of the early impressionists were seen, by the pictures of\r\nBerthe Morisot. Camille Mauclair, an enthusiastic admirer of this school\r\nof art, says: \"Berthe Morizot will remain the most fascinating figure of\r\nImpressionism--the one who has stated most precisely the femininity of\r\nthis luminous and iridescent art.\"\r\n\r\nA great-granddaughter of Fragonard, she seems to have inherited his\r\ntalent; Corot and Renoir forcibly appealed to her. These elements,\r\nmodified by her personal attitude, imparted a strong individuality to her\r\nworks, which divided honors with her personal charms.\r\n\r\nAccording to the general verdict, she was equally successful in oils and\r\nwater-colors. Her favorite subjects--although she painted others--were\r\nsea-coast views, flowers, orchards, and gardens and young girls in every\r\nvariety of costume.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Édouard Manet, she devoted herself to building up an\r\nappreciation of his work in the public mind. So intelligent were her\r\nmethods that she doubtless had great influence in making the memory of\r\nhis art enduring.\r\n\r\nAmong her most characteristic works are: \"The Memories of the Oise,\"\r\n1864; \"Ros-Bras,\" \"Finistère,\" 1868; \"A Young Girl at a Window,\" 1870; a\r\npastel, \"Blanche,\" 1873; \"The Toilet,\" and \"A Young Woman at the Ball.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*<b>NEY, ELIZABETH.</b> The Fine Arts jury of the St. Louis Exposition have\r\naccepted three works by this sculptor to be placed in the Fine Arts\r\nBuilding. They are the Albert Sidney Johnston memorial; the portrait bust\r\nof Jacob Grimm, in marble; and a bronze statuette of Garibaldi. It is\r\nunusual to allow so many entries to one artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>PAULI, HANNA</b>, family name, Hirsch. Bronze medal at Paris Exposition,\r\n1889. Born in Stockholm and pupil of the Academy of Fine Arts there;\r\nlater, of Dagnan-Bouveret, in Paris. Her husband, also an artist, is\r\nGeorg Pauli. They live in Stockholm, where she paints portraits and genre\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nAt the Paris Exposition, 1900, she exhibited two excellent portraits, one\r\nof her father and another of Ellen Key; also a charming genre subject,\r\n\"The Old Couple.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ROMANI, JUANA, H. C.</b> Born at Velletri, 1869. Pupil of Henner and\r\nRoybet, in Paris, where she lives. This artist is, _sui generis_, a\r\ndaughter of the people, of unconventional tastes and habits. She has\r\nboldly reproduced upon canvas a fulness of life and joy, such as is\r\nrarely seen in pictures.\r\n\r\nWhile she has caught something of the dash of Henner, and something of\r\nthe color of Roybet, and gained a firm mastery of the best French\r\ntechnique, these are infused with the ardor of a Southern temperament.\r\nHer favorite subjects are women--either in the strength and beauty of\r\nmaternity, or in the freshness of youth, or even of childhood.\r\n\r\nSome critics feel that, despite much that is desirable in her work, the\r\nsoul is lacking in the women she paints. This is no doubt due in some\r\nmeasure to certain types she has chosen--for example, Salome and\r\nHerodias, in whom one scarcely looks for such an element.\r\n\r\nHer portrait of Roybet and a picture of \"Bianca Capello\" were exhibited\r\nat Munich in 1893 and at Antwerp in 1894. The \"Pensierosa\" and a little\r\ngirl were at the Paris Salon in 1894, and were much admired. \"Herodias\"\r\nappeared at Vienna in 1894 and at Berlin the following year, while\r\n\"Primavera\" was first seen at the Salon of 1895. This picture laughs, as\r\nchildren laugh, with perfect abandon.\r\n\r\nA portrait of Miss Gibson was also at the Salon of 1895, and \"Vittoria\r\nColonna\" and a \"Venetian Girl\" were sent to Munich. These were followed\r\nby the \"Flower of the Alps\" and \"Desdemona\" in 1896; \"Doña Mona,\"\r\npalpitating with life, and \"Faustalla of Pistoia,\" with short golden hair\r\nand a majestic poise of the head, in 1897; \"Salome\" and \"Angelica,\" two\r\nwidely differing pictures in character and color, in 1898; \"Mina of\r\nFiesole,\" and the portrait of a golden-haired beauty in a costume of\r\nblack and gold, in 1899; the portrait of Mlle. H. D., in 1900;\r\n\"L'Infante,\" one of her most noble creations, of a remarkably fine\r\nexecution, and a ravishing child called \"Roger\"--with wonderful blond\r\nhair--in 1901.\r\n\r\nMlle. Romani often paints directly on the canvas without preliminary\r\nsketch or study, and sells many of her pictures before they are finished.\r\nSome of her works have been purchased by the French Government, and there\r\nare examples of these in the Luxembourg, and in the Gallery of\r\nMülhausen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>RUPPRECHT, TINI.</b> After having lessons from private instructors, this\r\nartist studied under Lenbach. She has been much influenced by\r\nGainsborough, Lawrence, and Reynolds, traces of their manner being\r\nevident in her work. She renders the best type of feminine seductiveness\r\nwith delicacy and grace; she avoids the trivial and gross, but pictures\r\nall the allurements of an innocent coquetry.\r\n\r\nHer portrait of the Princess Marie, of Roumania, was exhibited in Munich\r\nin 1901; its reality and personality were notable, and one critic called\r\nit \"an oasis in a desert of portraits.\" \"Anno 1793\" and \"A Mother and\r\nChild\" have attracted much favorable comment in Munich, where her star is\r\nin the ascendant, and greater excellence in her work is confidently\r\nprophesied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SCHWARTZE, THERESE.</b> Honorable mention, Paris Salon, 1885; gold\r\nmedal, 1889. Diploma at Ghent, 1892; gold medal, 1892. At International\r\nExhibition, Barcelona, 1898, a gold medal. Made a Knight of the Order of\r\nOrange-Nassau, 1896. Born in Amsterdam about 1851. A pupil of her father\r\nuntil his death, when she became a student under Gabriel Max, in Munich,\r\nfor a year. Returning to Amsterdam, she was much encouraged by Israels,\r\nBilders, and Bosboom, friends of her father.\r\n\r\nShe went to Paris in 1878 and was so attracted by the artistic life which\r\nshe saw that she determined to study there. But she did not succeed in\r\nfinding a suitable studio, neither an instructor who pleased her, and she\r\nreturned to Amsterdam. It was at this time that she painted the portrait\r\nof Frederick Müller.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1880 she went again to Paris, only to \"feast on things\r\nartistic.\" A little later she was summoned to the palace at Soestdijk to\r\ninstruct the Princess Henry of the Netherlands. In 1883 she served with\r\nmany distinguished artists on the art jury of the International\r\nExhibition at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 she once more yielded to the attraction that Paris had for her,\r\nand there made a great advance in her painting. In 1885 she began to work\r\nin pastel, and one of her best portraits in this medium was that of the\r\nPrincess (Queen) Wilhelmina, which was loaned by the Queen Regent for the\r\nexhibition of this artist's work in Amsterdam in 1890.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Government requested Miss Schwartze to paint her own portrait\r\nfor the Uffizi Gallery. This was shown at the Paris Salon, 1889, and\r\nmissed the gold medal by two votes. This portrait is thought by some good\r\njudges to equal that of Mme. Le Brun. The head with the interesting eyes,\r\nshaded by the hand which wards off the light, and the penetrating,\r\nobservant look, are most impressive.\r\n\r\nShe has painted a portrait of Queen Emma, and sent to Berlin in 1902 a\r\nportrait of Wolmaran, a member of the Transvaal Government, which was\r\nesteemed a work of the first rank. She has painted several portraits of\r\nher mother, which would have made for her a reputation had she done no\r\nothers. She has had many notable men and women among her sitters, and\r\nthough not a robust woman, she works incessantly without filling all the\r\ncommissions offered her.\r\n\r\nHer pictures are in the Museums of Amsterdam and Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nHer work is full of life and strength, and her touch shows her confidence\r\nin herself and her technical knowledge. She is, however, a severe critic\r\nof her own work and is greatly disturbed by indiscriminating praise. She\r\nis serious and preoccupied in her studio, but with her friends she is\r\nfull of gayety, and is greatly admired, both as a woman and as an artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>VAN DER VEER, MISS.</b> \"This artist,\" says a recent critic, \"has\r\nstudied to some purpose in excellent continental schools, and is endowed\r\nwithal with a creative faculty and breadth in conception rarely found in\r\nAmerican painters of either sex. Her genre work is full of life, light,\r\ncolor, and character, with picturesque grouping, faultless atmosphere,\r\nand a breadth of technical treatment that verges on audacity, yet never\r\nfails of its designed purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe fifty pictures exhibited by Miss Van der Veer in Philadelphia, in\r\nFebruary, 1904, included interiors, portraits--mostly in pastel--flower\r\nstudies and sketches, treating Dutch peasant life. Among the most notable\r\nof these may be mentioned \"The Chimney Corner,\" \"Saturday Morning,\"\r\n\"Mother and Child,\" and a portrait of the artist herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WALDAU, MARGARETHE.</b> Born in Breslau, 1860. After studying by herself\r\nin Munich, this artist became a pupil of Streckfuss in Berlin, and later,\r\nin Nuremberg, studied under the younger Graeb and Ritter. The first\r\nsubject chosen by her for a picture was the \"Portal of the Church of the\r\nMagdalene.\" Her taste for architectural motives was strengthened by\r\ntravel in Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany.\r\n\r\nThe fine old churches of Nuremberg and the venerable edifices of Breslau\r\nafforded her most attractive subjects, which she treated with such\r\ndistinction that her pictures were sought by kings and princes as well as\r\nby appreciative connoisseurs.\r\n\r\nHer success increased her confidence in herself and enhanced the boldness\r\nand freedom with which she handled her brush. An exhibition of her work\r\nin Berlin led to her receiving a commission from the Government to paint\r\ntwo pictures for the Paris Exposition, 1900. \"Mayence at Sunset\" and the\r\n\"Leipzig Market-Place in Winter\" were the result of this order, and are\r\ntwo of her best works.\r\n\r\nOccasionally this artist has painted genre subjects, but her real success\r\nhas not been in this direction.",
