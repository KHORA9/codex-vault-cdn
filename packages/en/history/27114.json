He\r\nsimply has aimed to present the salient points—the most important events\r\nand characters of four thousand years, in a connected narrative, without\r\ntheories or comments, and without encumbering the book with details of\r\ncomparatively little interest. Most of the ancient histories for schools,\r\nhave omitted to notice those great movements to which the Scriptures\r\nrefer; but these are here briefly presented, since their connection with\r\nthe Oriental world is intimate and impressive, and ought not to be\r\nomitted, even on secular grounds. What is history without a Divine\r\nProvidence?\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this work, the author has been contented with the\r\nlast standard authorities, which he has merely simplified, abridged, and\r\ncondensed, being most indebted to Rawlinson, Grote, Thirlwall, Niebuhr,\r\nMommsen, and Merivale,—following out the general plan of Philip Smith,\r\nwhose admirable digest, in three large octavos, is too extensive for\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nAlthough the author has felt warranted in making a free use of his\r\nmaterials, it will be seen that the style, arrangement, and reflections\r\nare his own. If the book prove useful, his object will be attained.\r\n\r\nSTAMFORD _October, 1869_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT ORIENTAL NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANTEDILUVIAN WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M1) The history of this world begins, according to the chronology of\r\nArchbishop Ussher, which is generally received as convenient rather than\r\nprobable, in the year 4004 before Christ. In six days God created light\r\nand darkness, day and night, the firmament and the continents in the midst\r\nof the waters, fruits, grain, and herbs, moon and stars, fowl and fish,\r\nliving creatures upon the face of the earth, and finally man, with\r\ndominion “over the fish of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and cattle,\r\nand all the earth, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”\r\nHe created man in his own image, and blessed him with universal dominion.\r\nHe formed him from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils\r\nthe breath of life. On the seventh day, God rested from this vast work of\r\ncreation, and blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, as we suppose,\r\nfor a day of solemn observance for all generations.\r\n\r\n(M2) He there planted a garden eastward in Eden, with every tree pleasant\r\nto the sight and good for food, and there placed man to dress and keep it.\r\nThe original occupation of man, and his destined happiness, were thus\r\ncentered in agricultural labor.\r\n\r\n(M3) But man was alone; so God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and\r\ntook one of his ribs and made a woman. And Adam said, “this woman,” which\r\nthe Lord had brought unto him, “is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh;\r\ntherefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave unto\r\nhis wife: and they shall be one flesh.” Thus marriage was instituted. We\r\nobserve three divine institutions while man yet remained in a state of\r\ninnocence and bliss—the Sabbath; agricultural employment; and marriage.\r\n\r\n(M4) Adam and his wife lived, we know not how long, in the garden of Eden,\r\nwith perfect innocence, bliss, and dominion. They did not even know what\r\nsin was. There were no other conditions imposed upon them than they were\r\nnot to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which\r\nwas in the midst of the garden—a preeminently goodly tree, “pleasant to\r\nthe eyes, and one to be desired.”\r\n\r\n(M5) Where was this garden—this paradise—located? This is a mooted\r\nquestion—difficult to be answered. It lay, thus far as we know, at the\r\nhead waters of four rivers, two of which were the Euphrates and the\r\nTigris. We infer thence, that it was situated among the mountains of\r\nArmenia, south of the Caucasus, subsequently the cradle of the noblest\r\nraces of men,—a temperate region, in the latitude of Greece and Italy.\r\n\r\n(M6) We suppose that the garden was beautiful and fruitful, beyond all\r\nsubsequent experience—watered by mists from the earth, and not by rains\r\nfrom the clouds, ever fresh and green, while its two noble occupants lived\r\nupon its produce, directly communing with God, in whose image they were\r\nmade, moral and spiritual—free from all sin and misery, and, as we may\r\nconjecture, conversant with truth in its loftiest forms.\r\n\r\nBut sin entered into the beautiful world that was made, and death by sin.\r\nThis is the first recorded fact in human history, next to primeval\r\ninnocence and happiness.\r\n\r\n(M7) The progenitors of the race were tempted, and did not resist the\r\ntemptation. The form of it may have been allegorical and symbolic; but, as\r\nrecorded by Moses, was yet a stupendous reality, especially in view of its\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n(M8) The tempter was the devil—the antagonist of God—the evil power of the\r\nworld—the principle of evil—a Satanic agency which Scripture, and all\r\nnations, in some form, have recognized. When rebellion against God began,\r\nwe do not know; but it certainly existed when Adam was placed in Eden.\r\n\r\n(M9) The form which Satanic power assumed was a serpent—then the most\r\nsubtle of the beasts of the field, and we may reasonably suppose, not\r\nmerely subtle, but attractive, graceful, beautiful, bewitching.\r\n\r\n(M10) The first to feel its evil fascination was the woman, and she was\r\ninduced to disobey what she knew to be a direct command, by the desire of\r\nknowledge as well as enjoyment of the appetite. She put trust in the\r\nserpent. She believed a lie. She was beguiled.\r\n\r\n(M11) The man was not directly beguiled by the serpent. Why the serpent\r\nassailed woman rather than man, the Scriptures do not say. The man yielded\r\nto his wife. “She gave him the fruit, and he did eat.”\r\n\r\n(M12) Immediately a great change came over both. Their eyes were opened.\r\nThey felt shame and remorse, for they had sinned. They hid themselves from\r\nthe presence of the Lord, and were afraid.\r\n\r\n(M13) God pronounced the penalty—unto the woman, the pains and sorrows\r\nattending childbirth, and subserviency to her husband; unto the man labor,\r\ntoil, sorrow—the curse of the ground which he was to till—thorns and\r\nthistles—no rest, and food obtained only by the sweat of the brow; and all\r\nthese pains and labors were inflicted upon both until they should return\r\nto the dust from whence they were taken—an eternal decree, never\r\nabrogated, to last as long as man should till the earth, or woman bring\r\nforth children.\r\n\r\n(M14) Thus came sin into the world, through the temptations of\r\nintroduction Satan and the weakness of man, with the penalty of labour,\r\npain, sorrow, and death.\r\n\r\n(M15) Man was expelled from Paradise, and precluded from re-entering it by\r\nthe flaming sword of cherubim, until the locality of Eden, by thorns and\r\nbriars, and the deluge, was obliterated forever. And man and woman were\r\nsent out into the world to reap the fruit of their folly and sin, and to\r\ngain their subsistence in severe toil, and amid, the accumulated evils\r\nwhich sin introduced.\r\n\r\n(M16) The only mitigation of the sentence was the eternal enmity between\r\nthe seed of the woman and the seed of the Serpent, in which the final\r\nvictory should be given to the former. The rite of sacrifice was\r\nintroduced as a type of the satisfaction for sin by the death of a\r\nsubstitute for the sinner; and thus a hope of final forgiveness held out\r\nfor sin, Meanwhile the miseries of life were alleviated by the fruits of\r\nlabor, by industry.\r\n\r\n(M17) Industry, then, became, on the expulsion from Eden, one of the final\r\nlaws of human happiness on earth, while the sacrifice held out hopes of\r\neternal life by the substitution which the sacrifice typified—the Saviour\r\nwho was in due time to appear.\r\n\r\nWith the expulsion from Eden came the sad conflicts of the race—conflicts\r\nwith external wickedness—conflicts with the earth—conflicts with evil\r\npassions in a man’s own soul.\r\n\r\n(M18) The first conflict was between Cain, the husbandman, and Abel, the\r\nshepherd; the representatives of two great divisions of the human family\r\nin the early ages. Cain killed Abel because the offering of the latter was\r\npreferred to that of the former. The virtue of Abel was faith: the sin of\r\nCain was jealousy, pride, resentment, and despair. The punishment of Cain\r\nwas expulsion from his father’s house, the further curse of the land for\r\n_him_, and the hatred of the human family. He relinquished his occupation,\r\nbecame a wanderer, and gained a precarious support, while his descendants\r\ninvented arts and built cities.\r\n\r\n(M19) Eve bear another son—Seth, among whose descendants the worship of\r\nGod was preserved for a long time; but the descendants of Seth\r\nintermarried finally with the descendants of Cain, from whom sprung a race\r\nof lawless men, so that the earth was filled with violence. The material\r\ncivilization which the descendants of Cain introduced did not preserve\r\nthem from moral degeneracy. So great was the increasing wickedness, with\r\nthe growth of the race, that “it repented the Lord that he had made man,”\r\nand he resolved to destroy the whole race, with the exception of one\r\nreligious family, and change the whole surface of the earth by a mighty\r\nflood, which should involve in destruction all animals and fowls of the\r\nair—all the antediluvian works of man.\r\n\r\n(M20) It is of no consequence to inquire whether the Deluge was universal\r\nor partial—whether it covered the whole earth or the existing habitations\r\nof men. All were destroyed by it, except Noah, and his wife, and his three\r\nsons, with their wives. The authenticity of the fact rests with Moses, and\r\nwith him we are willing to leave it.\r\n\r\n(M21) This dreadful catastrophe took place in the 600th year of Noah’s\r\nlife, and 2349 years before Christ, when world was 1655 years old,\r\naccording to Usshur, but much older according to Hale and other\r\nauthorities—when more time had elapsed than from the Deluge to the reign\r\nof Solomon. And hence there were more people destroyed, in all\r\nprobability, than existed on the earth in the time of Solomon. And as men\r\nlived longer in those primeval times than subsequently, and were larger\r\nand stronger, “for there were giants in those days,” and early invented\r\ntents, the harp, the organ, and were artificers in brass and iron, and\r\nbuilt cities—as they were full of inventions as well as imaginations, it\r\nis not unreasonable to infer, though we can not know with certainty, that\r\nthe antediluvian world was more splendid and luxurious than the world in\r\nthe time of Solomon and Homer—the era of the Pyramids of Egypt.\r\n\r\n(M22) The art of building was certainly then carried to considerable\r\nperfection, for the ark, which Noah built, was four hundred and fifty feet\r\nlong, seventy-five wide, and forty-five deep; and was constructed so\r\ncuriously as to hold specimens of all known animals and birds, with\r\nprovisions for them for more than ten months.\r\n\r\n(M23) This sacred ark or ship, built of gopher wood, floated on the\r\nworld’s waves, until, in the seventh month, it rested upon the mountains\r\nof Ararat. It was nearly a year before Noah ventured from the ark. His\r\nfirst act, after he issued forth, was to build an altar and offer\r\nsacrifice to the God who had preserved him and his family alone, of the\r\nhuman race. And the Lord was well pleased, and made a covenant with him\r\nthat he would never again send a like destruction upon the earth, and as a\r\nsign and seal of the covenant which he made with all flesh, he set his bow\r\nin the cloud. We hence infer that the primeval world was watered by mists\r\nfrom the earth, like the garden of Eden, and not by rains.\r\n\r\n(M24) “The memory of the Deluge is preserved in the traditions of nearly\r\nall nations, as well as in the narrative of Moses; and most heathen\r\nmythologies have some kind of sacred ark.” Moreover, there are various\r\ngeological phenomena in all parts of the world, which can not be accounted\r\nfor on any other ground than some violent disruption produced by a\r\nuniversal Deluge. The Deluge itself can not be explained, although there\r\nare many ingenious theories to show it might be in accordance with natural\r\ncauses. The Scriptures allude to it as a supernatural event, for an\r\nexpress end. When the supernatural power of God can be disproved, then it\r\nwill be time to explain the Deluge by natural causes, or deny it\r\naltogether. The Christian world now accepts it as Moses narrates it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTDILUVIAN HISTORY TO THE CALL OF ABRAHAM.—THE PATRIARCHAL CONSTITUTION,\r\nAND THE DIVISION OF NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M25) When Noah and his family issued from the ark, they were blessed by\r\nGod. They were promised a vast posterity, dominion over nature, and all\r\nanimals for food, as well as the fruits of the earth. But new laws were\r\nimposed, against murder, and against the eating of blood. An authority was\r\ngiven to the magistrate to punish murder. “Whosoever sheddeth man’s blood,\r\nby man shall _his_ blood be shed.” This was not merely a penalty, but a\r\nprediction. The sacredness of life, and the punishment for murder are\r\nequally asserted, and asserted with peculiar emphasis. This may be said to\r\nbe the Noachic Code, afterward extended by Moses. From that day to this,\r\nmurder has been accounted the greatest human crime, and has been the most\r\nseverely punished. On the whole, this crime has been the rarest in the\r\nsubsequent history of the world, although committed with awful frequency,\r\nbut seldom till other crimes are exhausted. The sacredness of life is the\r\ngreatest of human privileges.\r\n\r\n(M26) The government was patriarchal. The head of a family had almost\r\nunlimited power. And this government was religious as well as civil. The\r\nhead of the family was both priest and king. He erected altars and divided\r\ninheritances. He ruled his sons, even if they had wives and children. And\r\nas the old patriarchs lived to a great age, their authority extended over\r\nseveral generations and great numbers of people.\r\n\r\nNoah pursued the life of a husbandman, and planted vines, probably like\r\nthe antediluvians. Nor did he escape the shame of drunkenness, though we\r\nhave no evidence it was an habitual sin.\r\n\r\n(M27) From this sin and shame great consequences followed. Noah was\r\nindecently exposed. The second son made light of it; the two others\r\ncovered up the nakedness of their father. For this levity Ham was cursed\r\nin his children. Canaan, his son, was decreed to be a servant of\r\nservants—the ancestor of the races afterward exterminated by the Jews. To\r\nShem, for his piety, was given a special religious blessing. Through him\r\nall the nations of the earth were blessed. To Japhet was promised especial\r\ntemporal prosperity, and a participation of the blessing of Shem, The\r\nEuropean races are now reaping this prosperity, and the religious\r\nprivileges of Christianity.\r\n\r\n(M28) Four generations passed without any signal event. They all spoke the\r\nsame language, and pursued the same avocations. They lived in Armenia, but\r\ngradually spread over the surrounding countries and especially toward the\r\nwest and south. They journeyed to the land of Shinar, and dwelt on its\r\nfertile plains. This was the great level of Lower Mesopotamia, or Chaldea,\r\nwatered by the Euphrates.\r\n\r\n(M29) Here they built a city, and aspired to build a tower which should\r\nreach unto the heavens. It was vanity and pride which incited them,—also\r\nfear lest they should be scattered.\r\n\r\n(M30) We read that Nimrod—one of the descendants of Ham—a mighty hunter,\r\nhad migrated to this plain, and set up a kingdom at Babel—perhaps a revolt\r\nagainst patriarchal authority. Here was a great settlement—perhaps the\r\ncentral seat of the descendants of Noah, where Nimrod—the strongest man of\r\nhis times—usurped dominion. Under his auspices the city was built—a\r\nstronghold from which he would defy all other powers. Perhaps here he\r\ninstituted idolatry, since a tower was also a temple. But, whether fear or\r\nambition or idolatry prompted the building of Babel, it displeased the\r\nLord.\r\n\r\n(M31) The punishment which he inflicted upon the builders was confusion of\r\ntongues. The people could not understand each other, and were obliged to\r\ndisperse. The tower was left unfinished. The Lord “scattered the people\r\nabroad upon the face of all the earth.” Probably some remained at Babel,\r\non the Euphrates—the forefathers of the Israelites when they dwelt in\r\nChaldea. It is not probable that every man spoke a different language, but\r\nthat there was a great division of language, corresponding with the great\r\ndivision of families, so that the posterity of Shem took one course, that\r\nof Japhet another, and that of Ham the third—dividing themselves into\r\nthree separate nations, each speaking substantially the same tongue,\r\nafterward divided into different dialects from their peculiar\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n(M32) Much learning and ingenuity have been expended in tracing the\r\ndifferent races and languages of the earth to the grand confusion of\r\nBabel. But the subject is too complicated, and in the present state of\r\nscience, too unsatisfactory to make it expedient to pursue ethnological\r\nand philological inquiries in a work so limited as this. We refer students\r\nto Max Muller, and other authorities.\r\n\r\n(M33) But that there was a great tripartite division of the human family\r\ncan not be doubted. The descendants of Japhet occupied a great zone\r\nrunning from the high lands of Armenia to the southeast, into the\r\ntable-lands of Iran, and to Northern India, and to the west into Thrace,\r\nthe Grecian peninsula, and Western Europe. And all the nations which\r\nsubsequently sprung from the children of Japhet, spoke languages the roots\r\nof which bear a striking affinity. This can be proved. The descendants of\r\nJaphet, supposed to be the oldest son of Noah, possessed the fairest lands\r\nof the world—most favorable to development and progress—most favorable to\r\nultimate supremacy. They composed the great Caucasian race, which spread\r\nover Northern and Western Asia, and over Europe—superior to other races in\r\npersonal beauty and strength, and also intellectual force. From the times\r\nof the Greek and Romans this race has held the supremacy of the world, as\r\nwas predicted to Noah. “God shall enlarge Japhet, and he shall dwell in\r\nthe tents of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant.” The conquest of the\r\ndescendants of Ham by the Greeks and Romans, and their slavery, attest the\r\ntruth of Scripture.\r\n\r\n(M34) The descendants of Shem occupied another belt or zone. It extended\r\nfrom the southeastern part of Asia Minor to the Persian Gulf and the\r\npeninsula of Arabia. The people lived in tents, were not ambitious of\r\nconquest, were religious and contemplative. The great theogonies of the\r\nEast came from this people. They studied the stars. They meditated on God\r\nand theological questions. They were a chosen race with whom sacred\r\nhistory dwells. They had, compared with other races, a small territory\r\nbetween the possessions of Japhet on the north, and that of Ham on the\r\nsouth. Their destiny was not to spread over the world, but to exhibit the\r\ndealings of God’s providence. From this race came the Jews and the\r\nMessiah. The most enterprising of the descendants of Shem were the\r\nPhœnicians, who pursued commerce on a narrow strip of the eastern shore of\r\nthe Mediterranean, and who colonized Carthage and North Africa, but were\r\nnot powerful enough to contend successfully with the Romans in political\r\npower.\r\n\r\n(M35) The most powerful of the posterity of Noah were the descendants of\r\nHam, for more than two thousand years, since they erected great\r\nmonarchies, and were warlike, aggressive, and unscrupulous. They lived in\r\nEgypt, Ethiopia, Palestine, and the countries around the Red Sea. They\r\ncommenced their empire in Babel, on the great plain of Babylonia, and\r\nextended it northward into the land of Asshur (Assyria). They built the\r\ngreat cities of Antioch, Rehoboth, Calah and Resen. Their empire was the\r\noldest in the world—that established by a Cushite dynasty on the plains of\r\nBabylon, and in the highlands of Persia. They cast off the patriarchal\r\nlaw, and indulged in a restless passion for dominion. And they were the\r\nmost civilized of the ancient nations in arts and material life. They\r\nbuilt cities and monuments of power. These temples, their palaces, their\r\npyramids were the wonders of the ancient world. Their grand and somber\r\narchitecture lasted for centuries. They were the wickedest of the nations\r\nof the earth, and effeminacy, pride and sensuality followed naturally from\r\ntheir material civilization unhallowed by high religious ideas. They were\r\nhateful conquerors and tyrants, and yet slaves. They were permitted to\r\nprosper until their vices wrought out their own destruction, and they\r\nbecame finally subservient to the posterity of Japhet. But among some of\r\nthe descendants of Ham civilization never advanced. The negro race of\r\nAfrica ever has been degraded and enslaved. It has done nothing to advance\r\nhuman society. None of these races, even the most successful, have left\r\ndurable monuments of intellect or virtue: they have left gloomy monuments\r\nof tyrannical and physical power. The Babylonians and Egyptians laid the\r\nfoundation of some of the sciences and arts, but nothing remains at the\r\npresent day which civilization values.\r\n\r\nHow impressive and august the ancient prophecy to Noah! How strikingly\r\nhave all the predictions been fulfilled! These give to history an\r\nimperishable interest and grandeur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEBREW RACE FROM ABRAHAM TO THE SALE OF JOSEPH.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M36) We postpone the narrative of the settlements and empires which grew\r\nup on the banks of the Euphrates and the Nile, the oldest monarchies,\r\nuntil we have contemplated the early history of the Jews—descended from\r\none of the children of Shem. This is not in chronological order, but in\r\naccordance with the inimitable history of Moses. The Jews did not become a\r\nnation until four hundred and thirty years after the call of Abram—and\r\nAbram was of the tenth generation from Noah. When he was born, great\r\ncities existed in Babylon, Canaan, and Egypt, and the descendants of Ham\r\nwere the great potentates of earth. The children of Shem were quietly\r\nliving in tents, occupied with agriculture and the raising of cattle.\r\nThose of Japhet were exploring all countries with zealous enterprise, and\r\nfounding distant settlements—adventurers in quest of genial climates and\r\nfruitful fields.\r\n\r\nAbram was born in Ur, a city of the Chaldeans, in the year 1996 before\r\nChrist—supposed by some to be the Edessa of the Greeks, and by others to\r\nbe a great maritime city on the right bank of the Euphrates near its\r\nconfluence with the Tigris.\r\n\r\nFrom this city his father Terah removed with his children and kindred to\r\nHaran, and dwelt there. It was in Mesopotamia—a rich district, fruitful in\r\npasturage. Here Abram remained until he was 75, and had become rich.\r\n\r\n(M37) While sojourning in this fruitful plain the Lord said unto him, “get\r\nthee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s\r\nhouse, unto a land which I will show thee.” “And I will make thee a great\r\nnation, and will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a\r\nblessing. And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that\r\ncurseth thee. And in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.”\r\nSo Abram departed with Lot, his nephew, and Sarai, his wife, with all his\r\ncattle and substance, to the land of Canaan, then occupied by that Hamite\r\nrace which had probably proved unfriendly to his family in Chaldea. We do\r\nnot know by what route he passed the Syrian desert, but he halted at\r\nShechem, situated in a fruitful valley, one of the passes of the hills\r\nfrom Damascus to Canaan. He then built an altar to the Lord, probably\r\namong an idolatrous people. From want of pasturage, or some cause not\r\nexplained, he removed from thence into a mountain on the east of Bethel,\r\nbetween that city and Hai, or Ai, when he again erected an altar, and\r\ncalled upon the living God. But here he did not long remain, being driven\r\nby a famine to the fertile land of Egypt, then ruled by the Pharaohs,\r\nwhose unscrupulous character he feared, and which tempted him to practice\r\nan unworthy deception, yet in accordance with profound worldly sagacity.\r\nIt was the dictate of expediency rather than faith. He pretended that\r\nSarai was his sister, and was well treated on her account by the princes\r\nof Egypt, and not killed, as he feared he would be if she was known to be\r\nhis wife. The king, afflicted by great plagues in consequence of his\r\nattentions to this beautiful woman, sent Abram away, after a stern rebuke\r\nfor the story he had told, with all his possessions.\r\n\r\n(M38) The patriarch returned to Canaan, enriched by the princes of Egypt,\r\nand resumed his old encampment near Bethel. But there was not enough\r\npasturage for his flocks, united with those of Lot. So, with magnanimous\r\ngenerosity, disinclined to strife or greed, he gave his nephew the choice\r\nof lands, but insisted on a division. “Is not the whole land before thee,”\r\nsaid he: “Separate thyself, I pray thee: if thou wilt take the left hand,\r\nI will go to the right, and if thou depart to the right hand, then I will\r\ngo to the left.” The children of Ham and of Japhet would have quarreled,\r\nand one would have got the ascendency over the other. Not so with the just\r\nand generous Shemite—the reproachless model of all oriental virtues, if we\r\nmay forget the eclipse of his fair name in Egypt.\r\n\r\n(M39) Lot chose, as was natural, the lower valley of the Jordan, a fertile\r\nand well-watered plain, but near the wicked cities of the Canaanites,\r\nwhich lay in the track of the commerce between Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and\r\nthe East. The worst vices of antiquity prevailed among them, and Lot\r\nsubsequently realized, by a painful experience, the folly of seeking, for\r\nimmediate good, such an accursed neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAbram was contented with less advantages among the hills, and after a\r\nrenewed blessing from the Lord, removed his tents to the plain of Mamre,\r\nnear Hebron, one of the oldest cities of the world.\r\n\r\n(M40) The first battle that we read of in history was fought between the\r\nChaldean monarch and the kings of the five cities of Canaan, near to the\r\nplain which Lot had selected. The kings were vanquished, and, in the\r\nspoliation which ensued, Lot himself and his cattle were carried away by\r\nChederlaomer.\r\n\r\n(M41) The news reached Abram in time for him to pursue the Chaldean king\r\nwith his trained servants, three hundred and eighteen in number. In a\r\nmidnight attack the Chaldeans were routed, since a panic was created, and\r\nLot was rescued, with all his goods, from which we infer that Abram was a\r\npowerful chieftain, and was also assisted directly by God, as Joshua\r\nsubsequently was in his unequal contest with the Canaanites.\r\n\r\n(M42) The king of Sodom, in gratitude, went out to meet him on his return\r\nfrom the successful encounter, and also the king of Salem, Melchizedek,\r\nwith bread and wine. This latter was probably of the posterity of Shem,\r\nsince he was also a priest of the most high God, He blessed Abram, and\r\ngave him tithes, which Abram accepted.\r\n\r\n(M43) But Abram would accept nothing from the king of Sodom—not even to a\r\nshoe-latchet—from patriarchal pride, or disinclination to have any\r\nintercourse with idolators. But he did not prevent his young warriors from\r\neating his bread in their hunger. It was not the Sodomites he wished to\r\nrescue, but Lot, his kinsman and friend.\r\n\r\n(M44) Abram, now a powerful chieftain and a rich man, well advanced in\r\nyears, had no children, in spite of the promise of God that he should be\r\nthe father of nations. His apparent heir was his chief servant, or\r\nsteward, Elizur, of Damascus. He then reminds the Lord of the promise, and\r\nthe Lord renewed the covenant, and Abram rested in faith.\r\n\r\n(M45) Not so his wife Sarai. Skeptical that from herself should come the\r\npromised seed, she besought Abram to make a concubine or wife of her\r\nEgyptian maid, Hagar. Abram listens to her, and grants her request. Sarai\r\nis then despised by the woman, and lays her complaint before her husband.\r\nAbram delivers the concubine into the hands of the jealous and offended\r\nwife, who dealt hardly with her, so that she fled to the wilderness.\r\nThirsty and miserable, she was found by an angel, near to a fountain of\r\nwater, who encouraged her by the promise that her child should be the\r\nfather of a numerous nation, but counseled her to return to Sarai, and\r\nsubmit herself to her rule. In due time the child was born, and was called\r\nIshmael—destined to be a wild man, with whom the world should be at\r\nenmity. Abram was now eighty-six years of age.\r\n\r\n(M46) Fourteen years later the Lord again renewed his covenant that he\r\nshould be the father of many nations, who should possess forever the land\r\nof Canaan. His name was changed to Abraham (father of a multitude), and\r\nSarai’s was changed to Sarah. The Lord promised that from Sarah should\r\ncome the predicted blessing. The patriarch is still incredulous, and\r\nlaughs within himself; but God renews the promise, and henceforth Abraham\r\nbelieves, and, as a test of his faith, he institutes, by divine direction,\r\nthe rite of circumcision to Ishmael and all the servants and slaves of his\r\nfamily—even those “bought with money of the stranger.”\r\n\r\n(M47) In due time, according to prediction, Sarah gave birth to Isaac, who\r\nwas circumcised on the eighth day, when Abraham was 100 years old.\r\nIshmael, now a boy of fifteen, made a mockery of the event, whereupon\r\nSarah demanded that the son of the bondwoman, her slave, should be\r\nexpelled from the house, with his mother. Abraham was grieved also, and,\r\nby divine counsel, they were both sent away, with some bread and a bottle\r\nof water. The water was soon expended in the wilderness of Beersheba, and\r\nHagar sat down in despair and wept. God heard her lamentations, and she\r\nopened her eyes and saw that she was seated near a well. The child was\r\npreserved, and dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, pursuing the occupation\r\nof an archer, or huntsman, and his mother found for him a wife out of the\r\nland of Egypt. He is the ancestor of the twelve tribes of Bedouin Arabs,\r\namong whom the Hamite blood predominated.\r\n\r\n(M48) Meanwhile, as Abraham dwelt on the plains of Mamre, the destruction\r\nof Sodom and Gomorrah took place, because not ten righteous persons could\r\nbe found therein. But Lot was rescued by angels, and afterward dwelt in a\r\ncave, for fear, his wife being turned into a pillar of salt for daring to\r\nlook back on the burning cities. He lived with his two daughters, who\r\nbecame the guilty mothers of the Moabites and the Ammonites, who settled\r\non the hills to the east of Jordan and the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\n(M49) Before the birth of Isaac, Abraham removed to the South, and dwelt\r\nin Gerah, a city of the Philistines, and probably for the same reason that\r\nhe had before sought the land of Egypt. But here the same difficulty\r\noccurred as in Egypt. The king, Abimelech, sent and took Sarah, supposing\r\nshe was merely Abraham’s sister; and Abraham equivocated and deceived in\r\nthis instance to save his own life. But the king, warned by God in a\r\ndream, restored unto Abraham his wife, and gave him sheep, oxen, men\r\nservants and women servants, and one thousand pieces of silver, for he\r\nknew he was a prophet. In return Abraham prayed for him, and removed from\r\nhim and his house all impediments for the growth of his family. The king,\r\nseeing how Abraham was prospered, made a covenant with him, so that the\r\npatriarch lived long among the Philistines, worshiping “the everlasting\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\n(M50) Then followed the great trial of his faith, when requested to\r\nsacrifice Isaac. And when he was obedient to the call, and did not\r\nwithhold his son, his only son, from the sacrificial knife, having faith\r\nthat his seed should still possess the land of Canaan, he was again\r\nblessed, and in the most emphatic language. After this he dwelt in\r\nBeersheba.\r\n\r\n(M51) At the age of 120 Sarah died at Hebron, and Abraham purchased of\r\nEphron the Hittite, the cave of Machpelah, with a field near Mamre, for\r\nfour hundred shekels of silver, in which he buried his wife.\r\n\r\n(M52) Shortly after, he sought a wife for Isaac. But he would not accept\r\nany of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom he dwelt, but sent his\r\neldest and most trusted servant to Mesopotamia, with ten loaded camels, to\r\nsecure one of his own people. Rebekah, the grand-daughter of Nahor, the\r\nbrother of Abraham, was the favored damsel whom the Lord provided. Her\r\nfather and brother accepted the proposal of Abraham’s servant, and loaded\r\nwith presents, jewels of silver and jewels of gold, and raiment, the\r\nMesopotamian lady departed from her country and her father’s house, with\r\nthe benediction of the whole family. “Be thou the mother of thousands of\r\nmillions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.”\r\nThus was “Isaac comforted after his mother’s death.”\r\n\r\n(M53) Abraham married again, and had five sons by Keturah; but, in his\r\nlife-time, he gave all he had unto Isaac, except some gifts to his other\r\nchildren, whom he sent away, that they might not dispute the inheritance\r\nwith Isaac. He died at a good old age, 175 years, and was buried by his\r\nsons, Isaac and Ishmael, in the cave of Machpelah, which had been\r\npurchased of the sons of Heth. Isaac thus became the head of the house,\r\nwith princely possessions, living near a well.\r\n\r\n(M54) But a famine arose, as in the days of his father, and he went to\r\nGerar, and not to Egypt. He, however, was afraid to call Rebekah his wife,\r\nfor the same reason that Abraham called Sarah his sister. But the king\r\nhappening from his window to see Isaac “sporting with Rebekah,” knew he\r\nhad been deceived, yet abstained from taking her, and even loaded Isaac\r\nwith new favors, so that he became very great and rich—so much so that the\r\nPhilistines envied him, and maliciously filled up the wells which Abraham\r\nhad dug. Here again he was befriended by Abimelech, who saw that the Lord\r\nwas with him, and a solemn covenant of peace was made between them, and\r\nnew wells were dug.\r\n\r\n(M55) Isaac, it seems, led a quiet and peaceful life—averse to all strife\r\nwith the Canaanites, and gradually grew very rich. He gave no evidence of\r\nremarkable strength of mind, and was easily deceived. His greatest\r\naffliction was the marriage of his eldest and favorite son Esau with a\r\nHittite woman, and it was probably this mistake and folly which confirmed\r\nthe superior fortunes of Jacob.\r\n\r\n(M56) Esau was a hunter. On returning one day from hunting he was faint\r\nfrom hunger, and cast a greedy eye on some pottage that Jacob had\r\nprepared. But Jacob would not give his hungry brother the food until he\r\nhad promised, by a solemn oath, to surrender his birthright to him. The\r\nclever man of enterprise, impulsive and passionate, thought more, for the\r\nmoment, of the pangs of hunger than of his future prospects, and the\r\nquiet, plain, and cunning man of tents availed himself of his brother’s\r\nrashness.\r\n\r\n(M57) But the birthright was not secure to Jacob without his father’s\r\nblessing. So he, with his mother’s contrivance, for he was _her_ favorite,\r\ndeceived his father, and appeared to be Esau. Isaac, old and dim and\r\ncredulous, supposing that Jacob, clothed in Esau’s vestments as a hunter,\r\nand his hands covered with skins, was his eldest son, blessed him. The old\r\nman still had doubts, but Jacob falsely declared that he was Esau, and\r\nobtained what he wanted. When Esau returned from the hunt he saw what\r\nJacob had done, and his grief was bitter and profound. He cried out in his\r\nagony, “Bless me even me, also, O my father.” And Isaac said: “Thy brother\r\ncame with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.” And Esau said, “Is\r\nhe not rightly named Jacob—that is, a supplanter—for he hath supplanted me\r\nthese two times: he took away my birthright, and behold now he hath taken\r\naway my blessing.” “And he lifted up his voice and wept.” Isaac, then\r\nmoved, declared that his dwelling should be the fatness of the earth, even\r\nthough he should serve his brother,—that he should live by the sword, and\r\nfinally break the yoke from off his neck. This was all Esau could wring\r\nfrom his father. He hated Jacob with ill-concealed resentment, as was to\r\nbe expected, and threatened to kill him on his father’s death. Rebekah\r\nadvised Jacob to flee to his uncle, giving as an excuse to Isaac, that he\r\nsought a wife in Mesopotamia. This pleased Isaac, who regarded a marriage\r\nwith a Canaanite as the greatest calamity. So he again gave him his\r\nblessing, and advised him to select one of the daughters of Laban for his\r\nwife. And Jacob departed from his father’s house, and escaped the wrath of\r\nEsau. But Esau, seeing that his Hittite wife was offensive to his father,\r\nmarried also one of the daughters of Ishmael, his cousin.\r\n\r\n(M58) Jacob meanwhile pursued his journey. Arriving at a certain place\r\nafter sunset, he lay down to sleep, with stones for his pillow, and he\r\ndreamed that a ladder set up on the earth reached the heavens, on which\r\nthe angels of God ascended and descended, and above it was the Lord\r\nhimself, the God of his father, who renewed all the promises that had been\r\nmade to Abraham of the future prosperity of his house. He then continued\r\nhis journey till he arrived in Haran, by the side of a well. Thither\r\nRachel, the daughter of Laban, came to draw water for the sheep she\r\ntended. Jacob rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and\r\nwatered her flock, and kissed her, and wept, for he had found in his\r\ncousin his bride. He then told her who he was, and she ran and told her\r\nfather that his nephew had come, Isaac’s son, and Laban was filled with\r\njoy, and kissed Jacob and brought him to his house, where he dwelt a month\r\nas a guest.\r\n\r\n(M59) An agreement was then made that Jacob should serve Laban seven\r\nyears, and receive in return for his services his youngest daughter\r\nRachel, whom he loved. But Laban deceived him, and gave him Leah instead,\r\nand Jacob was compelled to serve another seven years before he obtained\r\nher. Thus he had two wives, the one tender-eyed, the other beautiful. But\r\nhe loved Rachel and hated Leah.\r\n\r\n(M60) Jacob continued to serve Laban until he was the father of eleven\r\nsons and a daughter, and then desired to return to his own country. But\r\nLaban, unwilling to lose so profitable a son-in-law, raised obstacles.\r\nJacob, in the mean time, became rich, although his flocks and herds were\r\nobtained by a sharp bargain, which he turned to his own account. The envy\r\nof Laban’s sons was the result. Laban also was alienated, whereupon Jacob\r\nfled, with his wives and children and cattle. Laban pursued, overtook him,\r\nand after an angry altercation, in which Jacob recounted his wrongs during\r\ntwenty years of servitude, and Laban claimed every thing as his—daughters,\r\nchildren and cattle, they made a covenant on a heap of stones not to pass\r\neither across it for the other’s harm, and Laban returned to his home and\r\nJacob went on his way.\r\n\r\n(M61) But Esau, apprised of the return of his brother, came out of Edom\r\nagainst him with four hundred men. Jacob was afraid, and sought to\r\napproach Esau with presents. The brothers met, but whether from fraternal\r\nimpulse or by the aid of God, they met affectionately, and fell into each\r\nother’s arms and wept. Jacob offered his presents, which Esau at first\r\nmagnanimously refused to take, but finally accepted: peace was restored,\r\nand Jacob continued his journey till he arrived in Thalcom—a city of\r\nShechem, in the land of Canaan, where he pitched his tent and erected an\r\naltar.\r\n\r\nHere he was soon brought into collision with the people of Shechem, whose\r\nprince had inflicted a great wrong. Levi and Simeon avenged it, and the\r\ncity was spoiled.\r\n\r\n(M62) Jacob, perhaps in fear of the other Amorites, retreated to Bethel,\r\npurged his household of all idolatry, and built an altar, and God again\r\nappeared to him, blessed him and changed his name to Israel.\r\n\r\n(M63) Soon after, Rachel died, on the birth of her son, Benjamin, and\r\nJacob came to see his father in Mamre, now 180 years of age, and about to\r\ndie. Esau and Jacob buried him in the cave of Machpelah.\r\n\r\nEsau dwelt in Edom, the progenitor of a long line of dukes or princes. The\r\nseat of his sovereignty was Mount Seir.\r\n\r\n(M64) Jacob continued to live in Hebron—a patriarchal prince, rich in\r\ncattle, and feared by his neighbors. His favorite son was Joseph, and his\r\nfather’s partiality excited the envy of the other sons. They conspired to\r\nkill him, but changed their purpose through the influence of Reuben, and\r\ncast him into a pit in the wilderness. While he lay there, a troop of\r\nIshmaelites appeared, and to them, at the advice of Judah, they sold him\r\nas a slave, but pretended to their father that he was slain by wild\r\nbeasts, and produced, in attestation, his lacerated coat of colors. The\r\nIshmaelites carried Joseph to Egypt, and sold him to Potaphar, captain of\r\nPharaoh’s guard. Before we follow his fortunes, we will turn our attention\r\nto the land whence he was carried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGYPT AND THE PHARAOHS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M65) The first country to which Moses refers, in connection with the\r\nHebrew history, is Egypt. This favored land was the seat of one of the\r\noldest monarchies of the world. Although it would seem that Assyria was\r\nfirst peopled, historians claim for Egypt a more remote antiquity. Whether\r\nthis claim can be substantiated or not, it is certain that Egypt was one\r\nof the primeval seats of the race of Ham. Mizraim, the Scripture name for\r\nthe country, indicates that it was settled by a son of Ham. But if this is\r\ntrue even, the tide of emigration from Armenia probably passed to the\r\nsoutheast through Syria and Palestine, and hence the descendants of Ham\r\nhad probably occupied the land of Canaan before they crossed the desert\r\nbetween the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. I doubt if Egypt had older\r\ncities than Damascus, Hebron, Zoar, and Tyre.\r\n\r\nBut Egypt certainly was a more powerful monarchy than any existing on the\r\nearth in the time of Abraham.\r\n\r\n(M66) Its language, traditions, and monuments alike point to a high\r\nantiquity. It was probably inhabited by a mixed race, Shemitic as well as\r\nHamite; though the latter had the supremacy. The distinction of castes\r\nindicates a mixed population, so that the ancients doubted whether Egypt\r\nbelonged to Asia or Africa. The people were not black, but of a reddish\r\ncolor, with thick lips, straight black hair, and elongated eye, and sunk\r\nin the degraded superstitions of the African race.\r\n\r\n(M67) The geographical position indicates not only a high antiquity, but a\r\nstate favorable to great national wealth and power. The river Nile,\r\nissuing from a great lake under the equator, runs 3,000 miles nearly due\r\nnorth to the Mediterranean. Its annual inundations covered the valley with\r\na rich soil brought down from the mountains of Abyssinia, making it the\r\nmost fertile in the world. The country, thus so favored by a great river,\r\nwith its rich alluvial deposits, is about 500 miles in length, with an\r\narea of 115,000 square miles, of which 9,600 are subject to the\r\nfertilizing inundation. But, in ancient times, a great part of the country\r\nwas irrigated, and abounded in orchards, gardens, and vineyards. Every\r\nkind of vegetable was cultivated, and grain was raised in the greatest\r\nabundance, so that the people lived in luxury and plenty while other\r\nnations were subject to occasional famines.\r\n\r\n(M68) Among the fruits, were dates, grapes, figs, pomegranates, apricots,\r\npeaches, oranges, citrons, lemons, limes, bananas, melons, mulberries,\r\nolives. Among vegetables, if we infer from what exist at present, were\r\nbeans, peas, lentils, luprins, spinach, leeks, onions, garlic, celery,\r\nchiccory, radishes, carrots, turnips, lettuce, cabbage, fennel, gourds,\r\ncucumbers, tomatoes, egg-plant. What a variety for the sustenance of man,\r\nto say nothing of the various kinds of grain,—barley, oats, maize, rice,\r\nand especially wheat, which grows to the greatest perfection.\r\n\r\nIn old times the horses were famous, as well as cattle, and sheep, and\r\npoultry. Quails were abundant, while the marshes afforded every kind of\r\nweb-footed fowl. Fish, too, abounded in the Nile, and in the lakes. Bees\r\nwere kept, and honey was produced, though inferior to that of Greece.\r\n\r\n(M69) The climate also of this fruitful land was salubrious without being\r\nenervating. The soil was capable of supporting a large population, which\r\namounted, in the time of Herodotus, to seven millions. On the banks of the\r\nNile were great cities, whose ruins still astonish travelers. The land,\r\nexcept that owned by the priests, belonged to the king, who was supreme\r\nand unlimited in power. The people were divided into castes, the highest\r\nbeing priests, and the lowest husbandmen. The kings were hereditary, but\r\nbelonged to the priesthood, and their duties and labors were arduous. The\r\npriests were the real governing body, and were treated with the most\r\nrespectful homage. They were councilors of the king, judges of the land,\r\nand guardians of all great interests. The soldiers were also numerous, and\r\nformed a distinct caste.\r\n\r\n(M70) When Abram visited Egypt, impelled by the famine in Canaan, it was\r\nalready a powerful monarchy. This was about 1921 years before Christ,\r\naccording to the received chronology, when the kings of the 15th dynasty\r\nreigned. These dynasties of ancient kings are difficult to be settled, and\r\nrest upon traditions rather than well defined historical grounds,—or\r\nrather on the authority of Manetho, an Egyptian priest, who lived nearly\r\n300 years before Christ. His list of dynasties has been confirmed, to a\r\ngreat extent, by the hieroglyphic inscriptions which are still to be found\r\non ancient monuments, but they give us only a barren catalogue of names\r\nwithout any vital historical truths. Therefore these old dynasties, before\r\nAbraham, are only interesting to antiquarians, and not satisfactory to\r\nthem, since so little is known or can be known. These, if correct, would\r\ngive a much greater antiquity to Egypt than can be reconciled with Mosaic\r\nhistory. But all authorities agree in ascribing to Menes the commencement\r\nof the first dynasty, 2712 years before Christ, according to Hales, but\r\n3893 according to Lepsius, and 2700 according to Lane. Neither Menes nor\r\nhis successors of the first dynasty left any monuments. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that Memphis was built by them, and possibly hieroglyphics were\r\ninvented during their reigns.\r\n\r\nBut here a chronological difficulty arises. The Scriptures ascribe ten\r\ngenerations from Shem to Abram. Either the generations were made longer\r\nthan in our times, or the seventeen dynasties, usually supposed to have\r\nreigned when Abram came to Egypt, could not have existed; for, according\r\nto the received chronology, he was born 1996, B.C., and the Deluge took\r\nplace 2349, before Christ, leaving but 353 years from the Deluge to the\r\nbirth of Abraham. How could seventeen dynasties have reigned in Egypt in\r\nthat time, even supposing that Egypt was settled immediately after the\r\nFlood, unless either more than ten generations existed from Noah to Abram,\r\nor that these generations extended over seven or eight hundred years?\r\nUntil science shall reconcile the various chronologies with the one\r\nusually received, there is but little satisfaction in the study of\r\nEgyptian history prior to Abram. Nor is it easy to settle when the\r\nPyramids were constructed. If they existed in the time of Abram a most\r\nrapid advance had been made in the arts, unless a much longer period\r\nelapsed from Noah to Abraham than Scripture seems to represent.\r\n\r\n(M71) Nothing of interest occurs in Egyptian history until the fourth\r\ndynasty of kings, when the pyramids of Ghizeh, were supposed to have been\r\nbuilt—a period more remote than Scripture ascribes to the Flood itself,\r\naccording to our received chronology. These were the tombs of the Memphian\r\nkings, who believed in the immortality of the soul, and its final reunion\r\nwith the body after various forms of transmigration. Hence the solicitude\r\nto preserve the body in some enduring monument, and by elaborate\r\nembalment. What more durable monument than these great masses of granite,\r\nbuilt to defy the ravages of time, and the spoliations of conquerors! The\r\nlargest of these pyramids, towering above other pyramids, and the lesser\r\nsepulchres of the rich, was built upon a square of 756 feet, and the\r\nheight of it was 489 feet 9 inches, covering an area of 571,536 feet, or\r\nmore than thirteen acres. The whole mass contained 90,000,000 cubic feet\r\nof masonry, weighing 6,316,000 tons. Nearly in the centre of this pile of\r\nstone, reached by a narrow passage, were the chambers where the royal\r\nsarcophagi were deposited. At whatever period these vast monuments were\r\nactually built, they at least go back into remote antiquity, and probably\r\nbefore the time of Abram.\r\n\r\n(M72) The first great name of the early Egyptian kings was Sesertesen, or\r\nOsirtasin I., the founder of the twelfth dynasty of kings, B.C. 2080. He\r\nwas a great conqueror, and tradition confounds him with the Sesostris of\r\nthe Greeks, which gathered up stories about him as the Middle Ages did of\r\nCharlemagne and his paladins. The real Sesostris was Ramenes the Great, of\r\nthe nineteenth dynasty. By the kings of this dynasty (the twelfth)\r\nEthiopia was conquered, the Labyrinth was built, and Lake Moevis dug, to\r\ncontrol the inundations. Under them Thebes became a great city. The\r\ndynasty lasted 100 years, but became subject to the Shepherd kings. These\r\nearly Egyptian monarchs wore fond of peace, and their subjects enjoyed\r\nrepose and prosperity.\r\n\r\n(M73) The Shepherd kings, who ruled 400 years, were supposed by Manetho to\r\nbe Arabs, but leaves us to infer that they were Phœnicians—as is\r\nprobable—a roving body of conquerors, who easily subdued the peaceful\r\nEgyptians. They have left no monumental history. They were alien to the\r\nconquered race in language and habits, and probably settled in Lower Egypt\r\nwhere the land was most fertile, and where conquests would be most easily\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nIt was under their rule that Abram probably visited Egypt when driven by a\r\nfamine from Canaan. And they were not expelled till the time of Joseph, by\r\nthe first of the eighteenth dynasty. The descendants of the old kings, we\r\nsuppose, lived in Thebes, and were tributary princes for 400 years, but\r\ngained sufficient strength, finally, to expel the Shemite invaders, even\r\nas the Gothic nations of Spain, in the Middle Ages, expelled their\r\nconquerors, the Moors.\r\n\r\n(M74) But it was under the Shepherd kings that the relations between Egypt\r\nand the Hebrew patriarchs took place. We infer this fact from the friendly\r\nintercourse and absence of national prejudices. The Phœnicians belonged to\r\nthe same Shemitic stock from which Abraham came. They built no temples.\r\nThey did not advance a material civilization. They loaded Abram and Joseph\r\nwith presents, and accepted the latter as a minister and governor. We read\r\nof no great repulsion of races, and see a great similarity in pursuits.\r\n\r\n(M75) Meanwhile, the older dynasties under whom Thebes was built, probably\r\nB.C. 2200, gathered strength in misfortune and subjection. They reigned,\r\nduring five dynasties, in a subordinate relation, tributary and oppressed.\r\nThe first king of the eighteenth dynasty seems to have been a remarkable\r\nman—the deliverer of his nation. His name was Aah-mes, or Amo-sis, and he\r\nexpelled the shepherds from the greater part of Egypt, B.C. 1525. In his\r\nreign we see on the monuments chariots and horses. He built temples both\r\nin Thebes and Memphis, and established a navy. This was probably the king\r\nwho knew not Joseph. His successors continued the work of conquest, and\r\nextended their dominion from Ethiopia to Mesopotamia, and obtained that\r\npart of Western Asia formerly held by the Chaldeans. They built the temple\r\nof Karnak, the “Vocal Memnon,” and the avenue of Sphinxes in Thebes.\r\n\r\n(M76) The grandest period of Egyptian history begins with the nineteenth\r\ndynasty, founded by Sethee I., or Sethos, B.C. 1340. He built the famous\r\n“Hall of Columns,” in the temple of Karnak, and the finest of the tombs of\r\nthe Theban kings. On the walls of this great temple are depicted his\r\nconquests, especially over the Hittites. But the glories of the monarchy,\r\nnow decidedly military, culminated in Ramesis II.—the Sesostris of the\r\nGreeks. He extended his dominion as far as Scythia and Thrace, while his\r\nnaval expeditions penetrated to the Erythræan Sea. The captives which he\r\nbrought from his wars were employed in digging canals, which intersected\r\nthe country, for purposes of irrigation, and especially that great canal\r\nwhich united the Mediterranean with the Red Sea. He added to the temple of\r\nKarnak, built the Memnonium on the western side of the Nile, opposite to\r\nThebes, and enlarged the temple of Ptah, at Memphis, which he adorned by a\r\nbeautiful colossal statue, the fist of which is (now in the British\r\nMuseum) thirty inches wide across the knuckles. But the Rameseum, or\r\nMemnonium, was his greatest architectural work, approached by an avenue of\r\nsphinxes and obelisks, in the centre of which was the great statue of\r\nRamesis himself, sixty feet high, carved from a single stone of the red\r\ngranite of Syene.\r\n\r\n(M77) The twentieth dynasty was founded by Sethee II., B.C. 1220 (or 1232\r\nB.C., according to Wilkinson), when Gideon ruled the Israelites and\r\nTheseus reigned at Athens and Priam at Troy. The third king of this\r\ndynasty—Ramesis III.—built palaces and tombs scarcely inferior to any of\r\nthe Theban kings, but under his successors the Theban power declined.\r\nUnder the twenty-first dynasty, which began B.C. 1085, Lower Egypt had a\r\nnew capital, Zoan, and gradually extended its power over Upper Egypt. It\r\nhad a strong Shemetic element in its population, and strengthened itself\r\nby alliances with the Assyrians.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-second dynasty was probably Assyrian, and began about 1009 B.C.\r\nIt was hostile to the Jews, and took and sacked Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n(M78) From this period the history of Egypt is obscure. Ruled by\r\nAssyrians, and then by Ethiopians, the grandeur of the old Theban monarchy\r\nhad passed away. On the rise of the Babylonian kingdom, over the ruins of\r\nthe old Assyrian Empire, Egypt was greatly prostrated as a military power.\r\nBabylon became the great monarchy of the East, and gained possession of\r\nall the territories of the Theban kings, from the Euphrates to the Nile.\r\n\r\nLeaving, then, the obscure and uninteresting history of Egypt, which\r\npresents nothing of especial interest until its conquest by Alexander,\r\nB.C. 332, with no great kings even, with the exception of Necho, of the\r\ntwenty-sixth dynasty, B.C. 611, we will present briefly the religion,\r\nmanners, customs, and attainments of the ancient Egyptians.\r\n\r\n(M79) Their religion was idolatrous. They worshiped various divinities:\r\nNum, the soul of the universe; Amen, the generative principle; Khom, by\r\nwhom the productiveness of nature was emblematized; Ptah, or the creator\r\nof the universe; Ra, the sun; Thoth, the patron of letters; Athor, the\r\ngoddess of beauty; Mu, physical light; Mat, moral light; Munt, the god of\r\nwar; Osiris, the personification of good; Isis, who presided over funeral\r\nrites; Set, the personification of evil; Anup, who judged the souls of the\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n(M80) These were principal deities, and were worshiped through sacred\r\nanimals, as emblems of divinity. Among them were the bulls, Apis, at\r\nMemphis, and Muenis, at Heliopolis, both sacred to Osiris. The crocodile\r\nwas sacred to Lebak, whose offices are unknown; the asp to Num; the cat to\r\nPasht, whose offices were also unknown; the beetle to Ptah. The worship of\r\nthese and of other animals was conducted with great ceremony, and\r\nsacrifices were made to them of other animals, fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\nMan was held accountable for his actions, and to be judged, according to\r\nthem. He was to be brought before Osiris, and receive from him future\r\nrewards or punishments.\r\n\r\n(M81) The penal laws of the Egyptians were severe. Murder was punished\r\nwith death. Adultery was punished by the man being beaten with a thousand\r\nrods. The woman had her nose cut off. Theft was punished with less\r\nseverity—with a beating by a stick. Usury was not permitted beyond double\r\nof the debt, and the debtor was not imprisoned.\r\n\r\n(M82) The government was a monarchy, only limited by the priesthood, into\r\nwhose order he was received, and was administered by men appointed by the\r\nking. On the whole, it was mild and paternal, and exercised for the good\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n(M83) Polygamy was not common, though concubines were allowed. In the\r\nupper classes women were treated with great respect, and were regarded as\r\nthe equals of men. They ruled their households. The rich were hospitable,\r\nand delighted to give feasts, at which were dancers and musicians. They\r\npossessed chariots and horses, and were indolent and pleasure-seeking. The\r\npoor people toiled, with scanty clothing and poor fare.\r\n\r\n(M84) Hieroglyphic writing prevailed from a remote antiquity. The papyrus\r\nwas also used for hieratic writing, and numerous papyri have been\r\ndiscovered, which show some advance in literature. Astronomy was\r\ncultivated by the priests, and was carried to the highest point it could\r\nattain without modern instruments. Geometry also reached considerable\r\nperfection. Mechanics must have been carried to a great extent, when we\r\nremember that vast blocks of stone were transported 500 miles and elevated\r\nto enormous heights. Chemistry was made subservient to many arts, such as\r\nthe working of metals and the tempering of steel. But architecture was the\r\ngreat art in which the Egyptians excelled, as we infer from the ruins of\r\ntemples and palaces; and these wonderful fabrics were ornamented with\r\npaintings which have preserved their color to this day. Architecture was\r\nmassive, grand, and imposing. Magical arts were in high estimation, and\r\nchiefly exercised by the priests. The industrial arts reached great\r\nexcellence, especially in the weaving of linen, pottery, and household\r\nfurniture. The Egyptians were great musicians, using harps, flutes,\r\ncymbals, and drums. They were also great gardeners. In their dress they\r\nwere simple, frugal in diet, though given to occasional excess; fond of\r\nwar, but not cruel like the Assyrians; hospitable among themselves, shy of\r\nstrangers, patriotic in feeling, and contemplative in character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEWS UNTIL THE CONQUEST OF CANAAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M85) When Joseph was sold by the Midianites to Potiphar, Egypt was\r\nprobably ruled by the Shepherd kings, who were called Pharaoh, like all\r\nthe other kings, by the Jewish writers. Pitiphar (Pet-Pha, dedicated to\r\nthe sun) was probably the second person in the kingdom. Joseph, the Hebrew\r\nslave, found favor in his sight, and was gradually promoted to the\r\noversight of his great household. Cast into prison, from the intrigues of\r\nPotiphar’s wife, whose disgraceful overtures he had virtuously and\r\nhonorably rejected, he found favor with the keeper of the prison, who\r\nintrusted him with the sole care of the prisoners, although himself a\r\nprisoner,—a striking proof of his transparent virtue. In process of time\r\ntwo other high officers of the king, having offended him, were cast into\r\nthe same prison. They had strange dreams. Joseph interpreted them,\r\nindicating the speedy return of the one to favor, and of the other to as\r\nsudden an execution. These things came to pass. After two years the king\r\nhimself had a singular dream, and none of the professional magicians or\r\npriests of Egypt could interpret it. It then occurred to the chief butler\r\nthat Joseph, whom he had forgotten and neglected, could interpret the\r\nroyal dream which troubled him. He told the king of his own dream in\r\nprison, and the explanation of it by the Hebrew slave. Whereupon Joseph\r\nwas sent for, shaven and washed, and clothed with clean raiment to appear\r\nin the royal palace, and he interpreted the king’s dream, which not only\r\nled to his promotion to be governor over Egypt, with the State chariots\r\nfor his use, and all the emblems of sovereignty about his person—a viceroy\r\nwhose power was limited only by that of the king—but he was also\r\ninstrumental in rescuing Egypt from the evils of that terrible famine\r\nwhich for seven years afflicted Western Asia. He was then thirty years of\r\nage, 1715 B.C., and his elevation had been earned by the noblest\r\nqualities—fidelity to his trusts, patience, and high principle—all of\r\nwhich had doubtless been recounted to the king.\r\n\r\n(M86) The course which Joseph pursued toward the Egyptians was apparently\r\nhard. The hoarded grain of seven years’ unexampled plenty was at first\r\nsold to the famishing people, and when they had no longer money to buy it,\r\nit was only obtained by the surrender of their cattle, and then by the\r\nalienation of their land, so that the king became possessed of all the\r\nproperty of the realm, personal as well as real, except that of the\r\npriests. But he surrendered the land back again to the people\r\nsubsequently, on condition of the payment of one-fifth of the produce\r\nannually (which remained to the time of Moses)—a large tax, but not so\r\ngreat as was exacted of the peasantry of France by their feudal and royal\r\nlords. This proceeding undoubtedly strengthened the power of the Shepherd\r\nkings, and prevented insurrections.\r\n\r\n(M87) The severity of the famine compels the brothers of Joseph to seek\r\ncorn in Egypt. Their arrival of course, is known to the governor, who has\r\nunlimited rule. They appear before him, and bowed themselves before him,\r\nas was predicted by Joseph’s dreams. But clothed in the vesture of\r\nprinces, with a gold chain around his neck, and surrounded by the pomp of\r\npower, they did not know him, while he knows them. He speaks to them,\r\nthrough an interpreter, harshly and proudly, accuses them of being spies,\r\nobtains all the information he wanted, and learns that his father and\r\nBenjamin are alive. He even imprisons them for three days. He releases\r\nthem on the condition that they verify their statement; as a proof of\r\nwhich, he demands the appearance of Benjamin himself.\r\n\r\n(M88) They return to Canaan with their sacks filled with corn, and the\r\nmoney which they had brought to purchase it, secretly restored, leaving\r\nSimeon as surety for the appearance of Benjamin. To this Jacob will not\r\nassent. But starvation drives them again to Egypt, the next year, and\r\nJacob, reluctantly is compelled to allow Benjamin to go with them. The\r\nunexpected feast which Joseph made for them, sitting himself at another\r\ntable—the greater portions given to Benjamin, the deception played upon\r\nthem by the secretion of Joseph’s silver cup in Benjamin’s sack, as if he\r\nwere a thief, the distress of all the sons of Jacob, the eloquent\r\npleadings of Judah, the restrained tears of Joseph, the discovery of\r\nhimself to them, the generosity of Pharaoh, the return of Jacob’s children\r\nladen not only with corn but presents, the final migration of the whole\r\nfamily, to the land of Goshen, in the royal chariots, and the consummation\r\nof Joseph’s triumphs, and happiness of Jacob—all these facts and incidents\r\nare told by Moses in the most fascinating and affecting narrative ever\r\npenned by man. It is absolutely transcendent, showing not only the highest\r\ndramatic skill, but revealing the Providence of God—that overruling power\r\nwhich causes good to come from evil, which is the most impressive lesson\r\nof all history, in every age. That single episode is worth more to\r\ncivilization than all the glories of ancient Egypt; nor is there anything\r\nin the history of the ancient monarchies so valuable to all generations as\r\nthe record by Moses of the early relations between God and his chosen\r\npeople. And that is the reason why I propose to give them, in this work,\r\ntheir proper place, even if it be not after the fashion with historians.\r\nThe supposed familiarity with Jewish history ought not to preclude the\r\nnarration of these great events, and the substitution for them of the less\r\nimportant and obscure annals of the Pagans.\r\n\r\n(M89) Joseph remained the favored viceroy of Egypt until he died, having\r\nthe supreme satisfaction of seeing the prosperity of his father’s house,\r\nand their rapid increase in the land of Goshen, on the eastern frontier of\r\nthe Delta of the Nile,—a land favorable for herds and flocks. The capital\r\nof this district was On—afterward Heliopolis, the sacred City of the Sun,\r\na place with which Joseph was especially connected by his marriage with\r\nthe daughter of the high priest of On. Separated from the Egyptians by\r\ntheir position as shepherds, the children of Jacob retained their\r\npatriarchal constitution. In 215 years, they became exceedingly numerous,\r\nbut were doomed, on the change of dynasty which placed Ramesis on the\r\nthrone, to oppressive labors. Joseph died at the age of 110—eighty years\r\nafter he had become governor of Egypt. In his latter years the change in\r\nthe Egyptian dynasty took place. The oppression of his people lasted\r\neighty years; and this was consummated by the cruel edict which doomed to\r\ndeath the infants of Israel; made, probably, in fear and jealousy from the\r\nrapid increase of the Israelites. The great crimes of our world, it would\r\nseem, are instigated by these passions, rather than hatred and malignity,\r\nlike the massacre of St. Bartholomew and the atrocities of the French\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n(M90) But a deliverer was raised up by God in the person of Moses, the\r\ngreatest man in human annals, when we consider his marvelous intellectual\r\ngifts, his great work of legislation, his heroic qualities, his moral\r\nexcellence, and his executive talents. His genius is more powerfully\r\nstamped upon civilization than that of any other one man—not merely on the\r\nJews, but even Christian nations. He was born B.C. 1571, sixty-four years\r\nafter the death of Joseph. Hidden in his birth, to escape the sanguinary\r\ndecree of Pharaoh he was adopted by the daughter of the king, and taught\r\nby the priests in all the learning of the Egyptians. He was also a great\r\nwarrior, and gained great victories over the Ethiopians. But seeing the\r\nafflictions of his brethren, he preferred to share their lot than enjoy\r\nall the advantages of his elevated rank in the palace of the king—an act\r\nof self-renunciation unparalleled in history. Seeing an Egyptian smite a\r\nHebrew, he slew him in a burst of indignation, and was compelled to fly.\r\nHe fled to Jethro, an Arab chieftain, among the Midianites. He was now\r\nforty years of age, in the prime of his life, and in the full maturity of\r\nhis powers. The next forty years were devoted to a life of contemplation,\r\nthe best preparation for his future duties. In the most secret places of\r\nthe wilderness of Sinai, at Horeb, he communed with God, who appeared in\r\nthe burning bush, and revealed the magnificent mission which he was\r\ndestined to fulfill. He was called to deliver his brethren from bondage;\r\nbut forty years of quiet contemplation, while tending the flocks of\r\nJethro, whose daughter he married, had made him timid and modest. God\r\nrenewed the covenant made to Abraham and Jacob, and Moses returned to\r\nEgypt to fulfill his mission. He joined himself with Aaron, his brother,\r\nand the two went and gathered together all the elders of the children of\r\nIsrael, and after securing their confidence by signs and wonders, revealed\r\ntheir mission.\r\n\r\n(M91) They then went to Pharaoh, a new king, and entreated of him\r\npermission to allow the people of Israel to go into the wilderness and\r\nhold a feast in obedience to the command of God. But Pharaoh said, who is\r\nthe Lord that I should obey his voice. I know not the Lord—_your God_. The\r\nresult was, the anger of the king and the increased burdens of the\r\nIsraelites, which tended to make them indifferent to the voice of Moses,\r\nfrom the excess of their anguish.\r\n\r\n(M92) Then followed the ten plagues which afflicted the Egyptians, and the\r\nobstinacy of the monarch, resolved to suffer any evil rather than permit\r\nthe Israelites to go free. But the last plague was greater than the king\r\ncould bear—the destruction of all the first-born in his land—and he\r\nhastily summoned Moses and Aaron in the night, under the impulse of a\r\nmighty fear, and bade them to depart with all their hosts and all their\r\npossessions. The Egyptians seconded the command, anxious to be relieved\r\nfrom further evils, and the Israelites, after spoiling the Egyptians,\r\ndeparted in the night—“a night to be much observed” for all generations,\r\nmarching by the line of the ancient canal from Rameses, not far from\r\nHeliopolis, toward the southern frontier of Palestine. But Moses,\r\ninstructed not to conduct his people at once to a conflict with the\r\nwarlike inhabitants of Canaan, for which they were unprepared, having just\r\nissued from slavery, brought them round by a sudden turn to the south and\r\neast, upon an arm or gulf of the Red Sea. To the eyes of the Egyptians,\r\nwho repented that they had suffered them to depart, and who now pursued\r\nthem with a great army, they were caught in a trap. Their miraculous\r\ndeliverance, one of the great events of their history, and the ruin of the\r\nEgyptian hosts, and their three months’ march and countermarch in the\r\nwilderness need not be enlarged upon.\r\n\r\n(M93) The exodus took place 430 years from the call of Abraham, after a\r\nsojourn in Egypt of 215 years, the greater part of which had been passed\r\nin abject slavery and misery. There were 600,000 men, besides women and\r\nchildren and strangers.\r\n\r\n(M94) It was during their various wanderings in the wilderness of\r\nSinai—forty years of discipline—that Moses gave to the Hebrews the rules\r\nthey were to observe during all their generations, until a new\r\ndispensation should come. These form that great system of original\r\njurisprudence that has entered, more or less, into the codes of all\r\nnations, and by which the genius of the lawgiver is especially manifested;\r\nalthough it is not to be forgotten he framed his laws by divine direction.\r\n\r\nLet us examine briefly the nature and character of these laws. They have\r\nbeen ably expounded by Bishop Warburton, Prof. Wines and others.\r\n\r\n(M95) The great fundamental principle of the Jewish code was to establish\r\nthe doctrine of the unity of God. Idolatry had crept into the religious\r\nsystem of all the other nations of the world, and a degrading polytheism\r\nwas everywhere prevalent. The Israelites had not probably escaped the\r\ncontagion of bad example, and the suggestions of evil powers. The most\r\nnecessary truth to impress upon the nation was the God of Abraham, and\r\nIsaac, and Jacob. Jehovah was made the supreme head of the Jewish state,\r\nwhom the Hebrews were required, first and last, to recognize, and whose\r\nlaws they were required to obey. And this right to give laws to the\r\nHebrews was deduced, not only because he was the supreme creator and\r\npreserver, but because he had also signally and especially laid the\r\nfoundation of the state by signs and miracles. He had spoken to the\r\npatriarchs, he had brought them into the land of Egypt, he had delivered\r\nthem when oppressed. Hence, they were to have no other gods than this God\r\nof Abraham—this supreme, personal, benevolent God. The violation of this\r\nfundamental law was to be attended with the severest penalties. Hence\r\nMoses institutes the worship of the Supreme Deity. It was indeed\r\nritualistic, and blended with sacrifices and ceremonies; but the idea—the\r\nspiritual idea of God as the supreme object of all obedience and faith,\r\nwas impressed first of all upon the minds of the Israelites, and engraven\r\non the tables of stone—“Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”\r\n\r\nHaving established the idea and the worship of God, Moses then instituted\r\nthe various rites of the service, and laid down the principles of civil\r\ngovernment, as the dictation of this Supreme Deity, under whose supreme\r\nguidance they were to be ruled.\r\n\r\n(M96) But before the details of the laws were given to guide the\r\nIsraelites in their civil polity, or to regulate the worship of Jehovah,\r\nMoses, it would seem, first spake the word of God, amid the thunders and\r\nlightnings of Sinai, to the assembled people, and delivered the ten\r\nfundamental commandments which were to bind them and all succeeding\r\ngenerations. Whether these were those which were afterward written on the\r\ntwo tables of stone, or not, we do not know. We know only that these great\r\nobligations were declared soon after the Israelites had encamped around\r\nSinai, and to the whole people orally.\r\n\r\nAnd, with these, God directed Moses more particularly to declare also the\r\nlaws relating to man-servants, and to manslaughter, to injury to women, to\r\nstealing, to damage, to the treatment of strangers, to usury, to slander,\r\nto the observance of the Sabbath, to the reverence due to magistrates, and\r\nsundry other things, which seem to be included in the ten commandments.\r\n\r\n(M97) After this, if we rightly interpret the book of Exodus, Moses went\r\nup into the mountain of Sinai, and there abode forty days and forty\r\nnights, receiving the commandments of God. Then followed the directions\r\nrespecting the ark, and the tabernacle, and the mercy-seat, and the\r\ncherubim. And then were ordained the priesthood of Aaron and his\r\nvestments, and the garments for Aaron’s sons, and the ceremonies which\r\npertained to the consecration of priests, and the altar of incense, and\r\nthe brazen laver.\r\n\r\n(M98) After renewed injunctions to observe the Sabbath, Moses received of\r\nthe Lord the two tables of stone, “written with the finger of God.” But as\r\nhe descended the mountain with these tables, after forty days, and came\r\nnear the camp, he perceived the golden calf which Aaron had made of the\r\nEgyptian ear-rings and jewelry,—made to please the murmuring people, so\r\nsoon did they forget the true God who brought them out of Egypt. And Moses\r\nin anger, cast down the tables and brake them, and destroyed the calf, and\r\ncaused the slaughter of three thousand of the people by the hands of the\r\nchildren of Levi.\r\n\r\n(M99) But God forgave the iniquity and renewed the tables, and made a new\r\ncovenant with Moses, enjoining upon him the utter destruction of the\r\nCanaanites, and the complete extirpation of idolatry. He again gathered\r\ntogether the people of Israel, and renewed the injunction to observe the\r\nSabbath, and then prepared for the building of the tabernacle, as the Lord\r\ndirected, and also for the making of the sacred vessels and holy garments,\r\nand the various ritualistic form of worship. He then established the\r\nsacrificial rites, consecrated Aaron and his sons as priests, laid down\r\nthe law for them in their sacred functions, and made other divers laws for\r\nthe nation, in their social and political relations.\r\n\r\n(M100) The substance of these civil laws was the political equality of the\r\npeople; the distribution of the public domains among the free citizens\r\nwhich were to remain inalienable and perpetual in the families to which\r\nthey were given, thus making absolute poverty or overgrown riches\r\nimpossible; the establishment of a year of jubilee, once every fifty\r\nyears, when there should be a release of all servitude, and all debts, and\r\nall the social inequalities which half a century produced; a magistracy\r\nchosen by the people, and its responsibility to the people; a speedy and\r\nimpartial administration of justice; the absence of a standing army and\r\nthe prohibition of cavalry, thus indicating a peaceful policy, and the\r\npreservation of political equality; the establishment of agriculture as\r\nthe basis of national prosperity; universal industry, inviolability of\r\nprivate property, and the sacredness of family relations. These were\r\nfundamental principles. Moses also renewed the Noahmic ideas of the\r\nsacredness of human life. He further instituted rules for the education of\r\nthe people, that “sons may be as plants grown up in their youth, and\r\ndaughters as corner stones polished after the similitude of a palace.”\r\nSuch were the elemental ideas of the Hebrew commonwealth, which have\r\nentered, more or less, into all Christian civilizations. I can not enter\r\nupon a minute detail of these primary laws. Each of the tribes formed a\r\nseparate state, and had a local administration of justice, but all alike\r\nrecognized the theocracy as the supreme and organic law. To the tribe of\r\nLevi were assigned the duties of the priesthood, and the general oversight\r\nof education and the laws. The members of this favored tribe were thus\r\npriests, lawyers, teachers, and popular orators—a literary aristocracy\r\ndevoted to the cultivation of the sciences. The chief magistrate of the\r\nunited tribes was not prescribed, but Moses remained the highest\r\nmagistrate until his death, when the command was given to Joshua. Both\r\nMoses and Joshua convened the states general, presided over their\r\ndeliberations, commanded the army, and decided all appeals in civil\r\nquestions. The office of chief magistrate was elective, and was held for\r\nlife, no salary was attached to it, no revenues were appropriated to it,\r\nno tribute was raised for it. The chief ruler had no outward badges of\r\nauthority; he did not wear a diadem; he was not surrounded with a court.\r\nHis power was great as commander of the armies and president of the\r\nassemblies, but he did not make laws or impose taxes. He was assisted by a\r\nbody of seventy elders—a council or senate, whose decisions, however, were\r\nsubmitted to the congregation, or general body of citizens, for\r\nconfirmation. These senators were elected; the office was not hereditary;\r\nneither was a salary attached to it.\r\n\r\n(M101) The great congregation—or assembly of the people, in which lay the\r\nsupreme power, so far as any human power could be supreme in a\r\ntheocracy,—was probably a delegated body chosen by the people in their\r\ntribes. They were representatives of the people, acting for the general\r\ngood, without receiving instructions from their constituents. It was\r\nimpossible for the elders, or for Moses, to address two million of people.\r\nThey spoke to a select assembly. It was this assembly which made or\r\nratified the laws, and which the executioner carried out into execution.\r\n\r\n(M102) The oracle of Jehovah formed an essential part of the constitution,\r\nsince it was God who ruled the nation. The oracle, in the form of a pillar\r\nof cloud, directed the wanderings of the people in the wilderness. This\r\nappeared amid the thunders of Sinai. This oracle decided all final\r\nquestions and difficult points of justice. It could not be interrogated by\r\nprivate persons, only by the High Priest himself, clad in his pontifical\r\nvestments, and with the sacred insignia of his office, by “urim and\r\nthummim.” Within the most sacred recesses of the tabernacle, in the Holy\r\nof Holies, the Deity made known his will to the most sacred personage of\r\nthe nation, in order that no rash resolution of the people, or senate, or\r\njudge might be executed. And this response, given in an audible voice, was\r\nfinal and supreme, and not like the Grecian oracles, venal and mendacious.\r\nThis oracle of the Hebrew God “was a wise provision to preserve a\r\ncontinual sense of the principal design of their constitution—to keep the\r\nHebrews from idolatry, and to the worship of the only true God as their\r\nimmediate protector; and that their security and prosperity rested upon\r\nadhering to his counsels and commands.”\r\n\r\n(M103) The designation and institution of high priest belonged not to the\r\ncouncil of priests—although he was of the tribe of Levi, but to the\r\nSenate, and received the confirmation of the people through their\r\ndeputies. “But the priests belonged to the tribe of Levi, which was set\r\napart to God—the king of the commonwealth.” “They were thus, not merely a\r\nsacerdotal body, appointed to the service of the altar, but also a\r\ntemporal magistracy having important civil and political functions,\r\nespecially to teach the people the laws.” The high priest, as head of the\r\nhierarchy, and supreme interpreter of the laws, had his seat in the\r\ncapital of the nation, while the priests of his tribe were scattered among\r\nthe other tribes, and were hereditary. The Hebrew priests simply\r\ninterpreted the laws; the priests of Egypt made them. Their power was\r\nchiefly judicial. They had no means of usurpation, neither from property,\r\nnor military command. They were simply the expositors of laws which they\r\ndid not make, which they could not change, and which they themselves were\r\nbound to obey. The income of a Levite was about five times as great as an\r\nordinary man, and this, of course, was derived from the tithes. But a\r\ngreater part of the soil paid no tithes. The taxes to the leading class,\r\nas the Levites were, can not be called ruinous when compared with what the\r\nEgyptian priesthood received, especially when we remember that all the\r\nexpenses connected with sacrifice and worship were taken from the tithes.\r\nThe treasures which flowed into the sacerdotal treasury belonged to the\r\nLord, and of these the priests were trustees rather than possessors.\r\n\r\n(M104) Such, in general terms, briefly presented, was the Hebrew\r\nconstitution framed by Moses, by the direction of God. It was eminently\r\nrepublican in spirit, and the power of the people through their\r\nrepresentatives, was great and controlling. The rights of property were\r\nmost sacredly guarded, and crime was severely and rigidly punished. Every\r\ncitizen was eligible to the highest offices. That the people were the\r\nsource of all power is proven by their voluntary change of government,\r\nagainst the advice of Samuel, against the oracle, and against the council\r\nof elders. We look in vain to the ancient constitutions of Greece and Rome\r\nfor the wisdom we see in the Mosaic code. Under no ancient government were\r\nmen so free or the laws so just. It is not easy to say how much the\r\nPuritans derived from the Hebrew constitution in erecting their new\r\nempire, but in many aspects there is a striking resemblance between the\r\nrepublican organization of New England and the Jewish commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe Mosaic code was framed in the first year after the exodus, while the\r\nIsraelites were encamped near Sinai. When the Tabernacle was erected, the\r\ncamp was broken up, and the wandering in the desert recommenced. This was\r\ncontinued for forty years—not as a punishment, but as a discipline, to\r\nenable the Jews to become indoctrinated into the principles of their\r\nconstitution, and to gain strength and organization, so as more\r\nsuccessfully to contend with the people they were commanded to expel from\r\nCanaan. In this wilderness they had few enemies, and some friends, and\r\nthese were wandering Arab tribes.\r\n\r\n(M105) We can not point out all the details of the wanderings under the\r\nleadership of Moses, guided by the pillar of fire and the cloud. After\r\nforty years, they reached the broad valley which runs from the eastern\r\ngulf of the Red Sea, along the foot of Mount Seir, to the valley of the\r\nDead Sea. Diverted from a direct entrance into Canaan by hostile Edomites,\r\nthey marched to the hilly country to the east of Jordan, inhabited by the\r\nAmorites. In a conflict with this nation, they gained possession of their\r\nwhole territory, from Mount Hermon to the river Anton, which runs into the\r\nDead Sea. The hills south of this river were inhabited by pastoral\r\nMoabites—descendants of Lot, and beyond them to the Great Desert were the\r\nAmmonites, also descendants of Lot. That nation formed an alliance with\r\nthe Midianites, hoping to expel the invaders then encamped on the plains\r\nof Moab. Here Moses delivered his farewell instructions, appointed his\r\nsuccessor, and passed away on Mount Pisgah, from which he could see the\r\npromised land, but which he was not permitted to conquer. That task was\r\nreserved for Joshua, but the complete conquest of the Canaanites did not\r\ntake place till the reign of David.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF CANAAN TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF DAVID.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only survivors of the generation that had escaped from Egypt were\r\nCaleb and Joshua. All the rest had offended God by murmurings, rebellion,\r\nidolatries, and sundry offenses, by which they were not deemed worthy to\r\nenter the promised land. Even Moses and Aaron had sinned against the Lord.\r\n\r\n(M106) So after forty years’ wanderings, and the children of Israel were\r\nencamped on the plains of Moab, Moses finally addressed them, forbidding\r\nall intercourse with Jews with other nations, enjoining obedience to God,\r\nrequiring the utter extirpation of idolatry, and rehearsing in general,\r\nthe laws which he had previously given them, and which form the substance\r\nof the Jewish code, all of which he also committed to writing, and then\r\nascended to the top of Pisgah, over against Jericho, from which he\r\nsurveyed, all the land of Judah and Napthali, and Manasseh and Gilead unto\r\nDan—the greater part of the land promised unto Abraham. He then died, at\r\nthe age of 120, B.C. 1451 and no man knew the place of his burial.\r\n\r\n(M107) The Lord then encouraged Joshua his successor, and the conquest of\r\nthe country began—by the passage over the Jordan and the fall of Jericho.\r\nThe manna, with which the Israelites for forty years had been miraculously\r\nfed, now was no longer to be had, and supplies of food were obtained from\r\nthe enemy’s country. None of the inhabitants of Jericho were spared except\r\nRahab the harlot, and her father’s household, in reward for her secretion\r\nof the spy which Joshua had sent into the city. At the city of Ai, the\r\nthree thousand men sent to take it were repulsed, in punishment for the\r\nsin of Achan, who had taken at the spoil of Jericho, a Babylonian garment\r\nand three hundred sheckels of silver and a wedge of gold. After he had\r\nexpiated this crime, the city of Ai was taken, and all its inhabitants\r\nwere put to death. The spoil of the city was reserved for the nation.\r\n\r\n(M108) The fall of these two cities alarmed the Hamite nations of\r\nPalestine west of the Jordan, and five kings of the Amorites entered into\r\na confederation to resist the invaders. The Gibeonites made a separate\r\npeace with the Israelites. Their lives were consequently spared, but they\r\nwere made slaves forever. Thus was fulfilled the prophecy that Canaan\r\nshould serve Shem.\r\n\r\nMeantime the confederate kings—more incensed with the Gibeonites than with\r\nthe Israelites, since they were traitors to the general cause, marched\r\nagainst Gibeon, one of the strongest cities of the land. It invoked the\r\naid of Joshua, who came up from Gilgal, and a great battle was fought, and\r\nresulted in the total discomfiture of the five Canaanite kings. The cities\r\nof Makkedah, Libnah, Gizu, Eglon, Hebron, successively fell into the hands\r\nof Joshua, as the result of their victory.\r\n\r\n(M109) The following year a confederation of the Northern kings, a vast\r\nhost with horses and chariots, was arrayed against the Israelites; but the\r\nforces of the Canaanites were defeated at the “Waters of Merom,” a small\r\nlake, formerly the Upper Jordan. This victory was followed by the fall of\r\nHazor, and the conquest of the whole land from Mount Halak to the Valley\r\nof Lebanon. Thirty-one kings were smitten “in the mountains, in the\r\nplains, in the wilderness, in the south country: the Hittites, the\r\nAmorites, the Canaanites, the Perizites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.”\r\nThere only remained the Philistines, whose power was formidable. The\r\nconquered country was divided among the different tribes, half of which\r\nwere settled on the west of Jordan. The tabernacle was now removed to\r\nShiloh, in the central hill country between Jordan and the Mediterranean,\r\nwhich had been assigned, to the tribe of Ephraim. Jacob had prophetically\r\ndeclared the ultimate settlements of the twelve tribes in the various\r\nsections of the conquered country. The pre-eminence was given to Judah,\r\nwhose territory was the most considerable, including Jerusalem, the future\r\ncapital, then in the hands of the Jebusites. The hilly country first fell\r\ninto the hands of the invaders, while the low lands were held tenaciously\r\nby the old inhabitants where their cavalry and war chariots were of most\r\navail.\r\n\r\n(M110) The Israelites then entered, by conquest, into a fruitful land,\r\nwell irrigated, whose material civilization was already established, with\r\norchards and vineyards, and a cultivated face of nature, with strong\r\ncities and fortifications.\r\n\r\n(M111) Joshua, the great captain of the nation, died about the year 1426\r\nB.C., and Shechem, the old abode of Abraham and Jacob, remained the chief\r\ncity until the fall of Jerusalem. Here the bones of Joseph were deposited,\r\nwith those of his ancestors.\r\n\r\n(M112) The nation was ruled by Judges from the death of Joshua for about\r\n330 years—a period of turbulence and of conquest. The theocracy was in\r\nfull force, administered by the high priests and the council of elders.\r\nThe people, however, were not perfectly cured of the sin of idolatry, and\r\npaid religious veneration to the gods of Phœnicia and Moab. The tribes\r\nenjoyed a virtual independence, and central authority was weak. In\r\nconsequence, there were frequent dissensions and jealousies and\r\nencroachments.\r\n\r\n(M113) The most powerful external enemies of this period were the kings of\r\nMesopotamia, of Moab, and of Hazor, the Midianites, the Amalekites, the\r\nAmmonites, and the Philistines. The great heroes of the Israelites in\r\ntheir contests with these people were Othnie, Ehud, Barak, Gideon,\r\nJepthna, and Samson. After the victories of Gideon over the Midianites,\r\nand of Jepthna over the Ammonites, the northern and eastern tribes enjoyed\r\ncomparative repose, and when tranquillity was restored Eli seems to have\r\nexercised the office of high priest with extraordinary dignity, but his\r\nsons were a disgrace and scandal, whose profligacy led the way to the\r\ntemporary subjection of the Israelites for forty years to the Philistines,\r\nwho obtained possession of the sacred ark.\r\n\r\n(M114) A deliverer of the country was raised up in the person of Samuel,\r\nthe prophet, who obtained an ascendancy over the nation by his purity and\r\nmoral wisdom. He founded the “School of the Prophets” in Kamah, and to him\r\nthe people came for advice. He seems to have exercised the office of\r\njudge. Under his guidance the Israelites recovered their sacred ark, which\r\nthe Philistines, grievously tormented by God, sent back in an impulse of\r\nsuperstitious fear. Moreover, these people were so completely overthrown\r\nby the Israelites that they troubled them no longer for many years.\r\n\r\n(M115) Samuel, when old, made his sons judges, but their rule was venal\r\nand corrupt. In disgust, the people of Israel then desired a king. Samuel\r\nwarned them of the consequences of such a step, and foretold the\r\noppression to which they would be necessarily subject; but they were bent\r\non having a king, like other nations—a man who should lead them on to\r\nconquest and dominion. Samuel then, by divine command, granted their\r\nrequest, and selected Saul, of the tribe of Benjamin, as a fit captain to\r\nlead the people against the Philistines—the most powerful foe which had\r\nafflicted Israel.\r\n\r\n(M116) After he had anointed the future king he assembled the whole nation\r\ntogether, through their deputies, at Mizpeh, who confirmed the divine\r\nappointment. Saul, who appeared reluctant to accept the high dignity, was\r\nfair and tall, and noble in appearance, patriotic, warlike, generous,\r\naffectionate—the type of an ancient hero, but vacillating, jealous, moody,\r\nand passionate. He was a man to make conquests, but not to elevate the\r\ndignity of the nation. Samuel retired into private life, and Saul reigned\r\nover the whole people.\r\n\r\n(M117) His first care was to select a chosen band of experienced warriors,\r\nand there was need, for the Philistines gathered together a great army,\r\nwith 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and encamped at Michmash. The\r\nIsraelites, in view of this overwhelming force, hid themselves from fear,\r\nin caves and amid the rocks of the mountain fastnesses. In their trouble\r\nit was found necessary to offer burnt sacrifices; but Saul, impulsive and\r\nassuming, would not wait to have the rites performed according to the\r\ndivine direction, but offered the sacrifices himself. By this act he\r\ndisobeyed the fundamental laws which Moses had given, violated, as it\r\nwere, the constitution; and, as a penalty for this foolish and rash act,\r\nSamuel pronounced his future deposition; but God confounded, nevertheless,\r\nthe armies of the Philistines, and they were routed and scattered. Saul\r\nthen turned against the Amalekites, and took their king, whom he spared in\r\nan impulse of generosity, even though he utterly destroyed his people.\r\nSamuel reproved him for this leniency against the divine command, Saul\r\nattempted to justify himself by the sacrifice of all the enemies’ goods\r\nand oxen, to which Samuel said, “Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt\r\nsacrifices and offerings as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold! to\r\nobey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams; for\r\nrebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness as iniquity and\r\nidolatry.” Most memorable words! thus setting virtue and obedience over\r\nall rites and ceremonies—a final answer to all ritualism and phariseeism.\r\n\r\n(M118) The remainder of the life of Saul was embittered by the\r\nconsciousness that the kingdom would depart from his house; and by his\r\njealousy of David, and his unmanly persecution of him; in whom he saw his\r\nsuccessor. He was slain, with three of his sons, at the battle of Gilboa,\r\nwhen the Philistines gained a great victory—B.C. 1056.\r\n\r\n(M119) David, meanwhile had been secretly anointed by Samuel as king over\r\nIsrael. Nothing could exceed his grief when he heard of the death of Saul,\r\nand of Jonathan, whom he loved, and who returned his love with a love\r\npassing that of women, and who had protected him against the wrath and\r\nenmity of his father.\r\n\r\n(M120) David, of the tribe of Judah, after his encounter with Goliath, was\r\nthe favorite of the people, and was rewarded by a marriage with the\r\ndaughter of Saul—Michal, who admired his gallantry and heroism. Saul too\r\nhad dissembled his jealousy, and heaped honors on the man he was\r\ndetermined to destroy. By the aid of his wife, and of Jonathan, and\r\nespecially protected by God, the young warrior escaped all the snares laid\r\nfor his destruction, and even spared the life of Saul when he was in his\r\npower in the cave of Engedi. He continued loyal to his king, patiently\r\nwaiting for his future exaltation.\r\n\r\n(M121) On the death of Saul, he was anointed king over Judah, at Hebron;\r\nbut the other tribes still adhered to the house of Saul. A civil war\r\nensued, during which Abner, the captain-general of the late king, was\r\ntreacherously murdered, and also Ishboseth, the feeble successor of Saul.\r\nThe war lasted seven and a half years, when all the tribes gave their\r\nallegiance to David, who then fixed his seat at Jerusalem, which he had\r\nwrested from the Jebusites, and his illustrious reign began, when he was\r\nthirty years of age, B.C. 1048, after several years of adversity and\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEWISH MONARCHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M122) We can not enter upon a detail of the conquests of David, the\r\ngreatest warrior that his nation has produced. In successive campaigns,\r\nextending over thirty years, he reduced the various Canaanite nations that\r\nremained unconquered—the Amalekites, the Moabites, the Philistines, the\r\nEdomites, and the Syrians of Tobah. Hiram, king of Tyre, was his ally. His\r\nkingdom extended from the borders of Egypt to the Euphrates, and from the\r\nvalley of Cœlo-Syria to the eastern gulf of the Red Sea. But his reign, if\r\nglorious and successful, was marked by troubles. He was continually at\r\nwar; his kingdom was afflicted with a plague as the punishment for his\r\nvanity in numbering the people; his son Amnon disgraced him; Absalom, his\r\nfavorite son, revolted and was slain; he himself was expelled for a time\r\nfrom his capital.\r\n\r\n(M123) But David is memorable for his character, and his poetry, his\r\nromantic vicissitudes of life, and as the founder of a dynasty rather than\r\nfor his conquests over the neighboring nations. His magnificent virtues\r\nblended with faults; his piety in spite of his sins, his allegiance to\r\nGod, and his faith in his promises invest his character with singular\r\ninterest. In his Psalms he lives through all the generations of men. He\r\nreigned thirty-three years at Jerusalem, and seven at Hebron, and\r\ntransmitted his throne to Solomon—his youngest child, a youth ten years of\r\nage, precocious in wisdom and culture.\r\n\r\n(M124) The reign of Solomon is most distinguished for the magnificent\r\nTemple he erected in Jerusalem, after the designs furnished by his father,\r\naided by the friendship of the Phœnicians. This edifice, “beautiful for\r\nsituation—the joy of the whole earth,” was the wonder of those times, and\r\nthough small compared with subsequent Grecian temples, was probably more\r\nprofusely ornamented with gold, silver, and precious woods, than any\r\nbuilding of ancient times. We have no means of knowing its architectural\r\nappearance, in the absence of all plans and all ruins, and much ingenuity\r\nhas been expended in conjectures, which are far from satisfactory. It most\r\nprobably resembled an Egyptian temple, modified by Phœnician artists. It\r\nhad an outer court for worshipers and their sacrifices, and an inner court\r\nfor the ark and the throne of Jehovah, into which the high priest alone\r\nentered, and only once a year. It was erected upon a solid platform of\r\nstone, having a resemblance to the temples of Paestum. The portico, as\r\nrebuilt, in the time of Herod, was 180 feet high, and the temple itself\r\nwas entered by nine gates thickly coated with silver and gold. The inner\r\nsanctuary was covered on all sides by plates of gold, and was dazzling to\r\nthe eye. It was connected with various courts and porticoes which gave to\r\nit an imposing appearance. Its consecration by Solomon, amid the cloud of\r\nglories in which Jehovah took possession of it, and the immense body of\r\nmusicians and singers, was probably the grandest religious service ever\r\nperformed. That 30,000 men were employed by Solomon, in hewing timber on\r\nMount Lebanon, and 70,000 more in hewing stones, would indicate a very\r\nextensive and costly edifice. The stones which composed the foundation\r\nwere of extraordinary size, and rivaled the greatest works of the\r\nEgyptians. The whole temple was overlaid with gold—a proof of its\r\nextraordinary splendor, and it took seven years to build it.\r\n\r\n(M125) The palace of Solomon must also have been of great magnificence, on\r\nwhich the resources of his kingdom were employed for thirteen years. He\r\nmoreover built a palace for his wife, the daughter of Pharaoh, composed of\r\ncostly stones, the foundation-stones of which were fifteen feet in length,\r\nsurrounded with beautiful columns. But these palaces did not include all\r\nhis works, for the courts of the temple were ornamented with brazen\r\npillars, with elaborate capitals, brazen seas standing upon bronze oxen,\r\nbrazen bases ornamented with figures of various animals, brazen layers,\r\none of which contained forty baths, altars of gold, tables, candelabras,\r\nbasins, censers and other sacred vessels of pure gold,—all of which\r\ntogether were of enormous expense and great beauty.\r\n\r\n(M126) During the execution of these splendid works, which occupied\r\nthirteen years or more, Solomon gave extraordinary indications of wisdom,\r\nas well as signs of great temporal prosperity. His kingdom was the most\r\npowerful of Western Asia, and he enjoyed peace with other nations. His\r\nfame spread through the East, and the Queen of Sheba, among others, came\r\nto visit him, and witness his wealth and prosperity. She was amazed and\r\nastonished at the splendor of his life, the magnificence of his court, and\r\nthe brilliancy of his conversation, and she burst out in the most\r\nunbounded panegyrics. “The half was not told me.” She departed leaving a\r\npresent of one hundred and twenty talents of gold, besides spices and\r\nprecious stones; and he gave, in return, all she asked. We may judge of\r\nthe wealth of Solomon from the fact that in one year six hundred and\r\nsixty-six talents of gold flowed into his treasury, besides the spices,\r\nand the precious stones, and ivory, and rare curiosities which were\r\nbrought to him from Arabia and India. The voyages of his ships occupied\r\nthree years, and it is supposed that they doubled the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nAll his banqueting cups and dishes were of pure gold, and “he exceeded all\r\nthe kings of the earth for riches and wisdom,” who made their\r\ncontributions with royal munificence. In his army were 1,400 chariots and\r\n12,000 horses, which it would seem were purchased in Egypt.\r\n\r\n(M127) Intoxicated by this splendor, and enervated by luxury, Solomon\r\nforgot his higher duties, and yielded to the fascination of oriental\r\ncourts. In his harem were 700 wives, princesses, and 300 concubines, who\r\nturned his heart to idolatry. In punishment for his apostasy, God declared\r\nthat his kingdom should be divided, and that his son should reign only\r\nover the single tribe of Judah, which was spared him for the sake of his\r\nfather David. In his latter days he was disturbed in his delusions by\r\nvarious adversaries who rose up against him—by Hadad, a prince of Edom,\r\nand Rezon, king of Damascus, and Jeroboam, one of his principal officers,\r\nwho afterward became king of the ten revolted tribes. Solomon continued,\r\nhowever, to reign over the united tribes for forty years, when he was\r\ngathered to his fathers.\r\n\r\n(M128) The apostasy of Solomon is the most mournful fall recorded in\r\nhistory, thereby showing that no intellectual power can rescue a man from\r\nthe indulgence of his passions and the sins of pride and vainglory. How\r\nimmeasurably superior to him in self-control was Marcus Aurelius, who had\r\nthe whole world at his feet! It was women who had estranged him from\r\nallegiance to God—the princesses of idolatrous nations. Although no\r\nmention is made of his repentance, the heart of the world will not accept\r\nhis final impenitence; and we infer from the book of Ecclesiastes, written\r\nwhen all his delusions were dispelled—that sad and bitter and cynical\r\ncomposition,—that he was at least finally persuaded that the fear of the\r\nLord constitutes the beginning and the end of all wisdom in this\r\nprobationary state. And we can not but feel that he who urged this wisdom\r\nupon the young with so much reason and eloquence at last was made to feel\r\nits power upon his own soul.\r\n\r\n(M129) The government of Solomon, nevertheless had proved arbitrary, and\r\nhis public works oppressive. The monarch whom he most resembled, in his\r\ntaste for magnificence, in the splendor of his reign, and in the vexations\r\nand humiliations of his latter days, was Louis XIV. of France, who sowed\r\nthe seeds of future revolutions. So Solomon prepared the way for\r\nrebellion, by his grievous exactions. Under his son Rehoboam, a vain and\r\nfrivolous, and obstinate young man, who ascended the throne B.C. 975, the\r\nrevolt took place. He would not listen to his father’s councillors, and\r\nincreased rather than mitigated the burdens of the people. And this revolt\r\nwas successful: ten tribes joined the standard of Jeroboam, with 800,000\r\nfighting men. Judah remained faithful to Rehoboam, and the tribe of\r\nBenjamin subsequently joined it, and from its geographical situation, it\r\nremained nearly as powerful as the other tribes, having 500,000 fighting\r\nmen. But the area of territory was only quarter as large.\r\n\r\n(M130) The Jewish nation is now divided. The descendants of David reign at\r\nJerusalem; the usurper and rebel Jeroboam reigns over the ten tribes, at\r\nShechem.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clearness of representation we will first present the\r\nfortunes of the legitimate kings who reigned over the tribe of Judah.\r\n\r\n(M131) Rehoboam reigned forty-one years at Jerusalem, but did evil in the\r\nsight of the Lord. In the fifth year of his reign his capital was rifled\r\nby the king of Egypt, who took away the treasures which Solomon had\r\naccumulated. He was also at war with Jeroboam all his days. He was\r\nsucceeded by his son Abijam, whose reign was evil and unfortunate, during\r\nwhich the country was afflicted with wars which lasted for ninety years\r\nbetween Judah and Israel. But his reign was short, lasting only three\r\nyears, and he was succeeded by Asa, his son, an upright and warlike\r\nprince, who removed the idols which his father had set up. He also formed\r\na league with Ben-Hadad, king of Syria, and, with a large bribe, induced\r\nhim to break with Baasha, king of Israel. His reign lasted forty years,\r\nand he was succeeded by his son Jehoshaphat, B.C. 954. Under this prince\r\nthe long wars between Judah and Israel terminated, probably on account of\r\nthe marriage of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, with the daughter of Ahab,\r\nking of Israel—an unfortunate alliance on moral, if not political grounds.\r\nJehoshaphat reigned thirty-five years, prosperously and virtuously, and\r\nhis ships visited Ophir for gold as in the time of Solomon, being in\r\nalliance with the Phœnicians. His son Jehoram succeeded him, and reigned\r\neight years, but was disgraced by the idolatries which Ahab encouraged. It\r\nwas about this time that Elijah and Elisha were prophets of the Lord,\r\nwhose field of duties lay chiefly among the idolatrous people of the ten\r\ntribes. During the reign of Jehoram, Edom revolted from Judah, and\r\nsucceeded in maintaining its independence, according to the predictions\r\nmade to Esau, that his posterity, after serving Israel, should finally\r\nbreak their yoke.\r\n\r\n(M132) His son Ahaziah succeeded him at Jerusalem B.C. 885, but formed an\r\nalliance with Jehoram, king of Israel, and after a brief and wicked reign\r\nof one year, he was slain by Jehu, the great instrument of divine\r\nvengeance on the idolaters. Of his numerous sons, the infant Joash alone\r\nwas spared by Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, who usurped\r\nauthority in the name of the infant king, until she was overthrown by the\r\nhigh priest Jehoiada. The usurpations of this queen have furnished a\r\nsubject for one of the finest tragedies of Racine. Jehoiada restored the\r\ntemple worship, and instituted many other reforms, having supreme power,\r\nlike Dunstan over the Saxon kings, when they were ruled by priests. His\r\ndeath left Judah under the dominion of the patriarchal rulers (the princes\r\nof Judah), who opposed all reforms, and even slew the son of Jehoida,\r\nZechariah the prophet, between the altar and the temple. It would seem\r\nthat Joash ruled wisely and benignantly during the life of Jehoiada, by\r\nwhom he was influenced—a venerable old man of 130 years of age when he\r\ndied. After his death Joash gave occasion for reproach, by permitting or\r\ncommanding the assassination of Zechariah, who had reproved the people for\r\ntheir sins, and his country was invaded by the Syrians under Hazaal, and\r\nthey sent the spoil of Jerusalem to Damascus. Joash reigned in all forty\r\nyears, and was assassinated by his servants.\r\n\r\n(M133) His son Amaziah succeeded him B.C. 839, and reigned twenty-nine\r\nyears. He was on the whole a good and able prince, and gained great\r\nvictories over the Edomites whom he attempted to reconquer. He punished\r\nalso the murderers of his father, and spared their sons, according to the\r\nmerciful provision of the laws of Moses. But he worshiped the gods of the\r\nEdomites, and was filled with vainglory from his successes over them. It\r\nwas then he rashly challenged the king of Israel, who replied haughtily:\r\n“The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon,\r\nsaying, give thy daughter to my son to wife, and there passed by a wild\r\nbeast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.” “So thou hast\r\nsmitten the Edomites, and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast. Abide now\r\nat home; why shouldst thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldst fall,\r\neven thou and Judah with thee.” But Amaziah would not heed, and the two\r\nkings encountered each other in battle, and Judah suffered a disastrous\r\ndefeat, and Joash, the king of Israel, came to Jerusalem and took all the\r\ngold and silver and all the sacred vessels of the temple and the treasures\r\nof the royal palace, and returned to Samaria. After this humiliation\r\nAmaziah reigned, probably wisely, more than fifteen years, until falling\r\ninto evil courses, he was slain in a conspiracy, B.C. 810, and his son\r\nUzziah or Azariah, a boy of sixteen, was made king by the people of Judah.\r\n\r\n(M134) This monarch enjoyed a long and prosperous reign of fifty-two\r\nyears. He reorganized the army and refortified his capital. He conquered\r\nthe Philistines, and also the Arabs, on his borders: received tribute from\r\nthe Ammonites, and spread his name unto Egypt. During his reign the\r\nkingdom of Judah and Benjamin had great prosperity and power. The army\r\nnumbered 307,500 men well equipped and armed, with military engines to\r\nshoot arrows and stones from the towers and walls. He also built castles\r\nin the desert, and digged wells for his troops stationed there. He\r\ndeveloped the resources of his country, and devoted himself especially to\r\nthe arts of agriculture and the cultivation of the vine, and the raising\r\nof cattle. But he could not stand prosperity, and in his presumption,\r\nattempted even to force himself in the sacred part of the temple to offer\r\nsacrifices, which was permitted to the priests alone; for which violation\r\nof the sacred laws of the realm, he was smitten with leprosy—the most\r\nloathsome of all the diseases which afflict the East. As a leper, he\r\nremained isolated the rest of his life, not even being permitted by the\r\nlaws to enter the precincts of the temple to worship, or administer his\r\nkingdom. It was during his reign that the Assyrians laid Samaria under\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n(M135) He was succeeded by Jotham, his son, B.C. 758, who carried on his\r\nfather’s reforms and wars, and was therefore prospered. It is worthy of\r\nnotice that the kings of Judah, who were good, and abstained from\r\nidolatry, enjoyed great temporal prosperity. Jotham reigned sixteen years,\r\nreceiving tribute from the Ammonites, and was succeeded by Ahaz, who\r\nwalked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and restored idolatrous and\r\nsuperstitious rites. Besieged in Jerusalem by the forces of Rezin, king of\r\nSyria, and Pekah, king of Israel, and afflicted by the Edomites and\r\nPhilistines, he invoked the aid of Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria,\r\noffering him the treasure of the temple and his royal palace. The Assyrian\r\nmonarch responded, and took Damascus, and slew its king. Ahaz, in his\r\ndistress, yet sinned still more against the Lord by sacrificing to the\r\ngods of Damascus whither he went to meet the Assyrian king. He died in the\r\nyear B.C. 726, after a reign of sixteen years, and Hezekiah, his son,\r\nreigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n(M136) This prince was one of the best and greatest of the kings of Judah.\r\nHe carried his zeal against idolatry so far as to break in pieces the\r\nbrazen serpent of Moses, which had become an object of superstitious\r\nhomage. He proclaimed a solemn passover, which was held in Jerusalem with\r\nextraordinary ceremony, and at which 2,000 bullocks and 17,000 sheep were\r\nslaughtered. No such day of national jubilee had been seen since the reign\r\nof Solomon. He cut down the groves in which idolatrous priests performed\r\ntheir mysterious rites, and overthrew their altars throughout the land.\r\nThe temple was purified, and the courses of the priests were restored.\r\nUnder his encouragement the people brought in joyfully their tithes to the\r\npriests and levites, and offerings for the temple.\r\n\r\n(M137) In all his reforms he was ably supported by Isaiah, the most\r\nremarkable of all the prophets who flourished during the latter days of\r\nthe Hebrew monarchy. Under his direction he made war successfully against\r\nthe Philistines, and sought to recover the independence of Judah. In the\r\nfourteenth year of his reign, Sennacherib invaded Palestine. Hezekiah\r\npurchased his favor by a present of three hundred talents of silver and\r\nthirty talents of gold, which stripped his palace and the temple of all\r\ntheir treasure. But whether he neglected to pay further tribute or not, he\r\noffended the king of Assyria, who marched upon Jerusalem, but was arrested\r\nin his purpose by the miraculous destruction of his army, which caused him\r\nto retreat with shame into his own country. After this his reign was\r\npeaceful and splendid, and he accumulated treasures greater than had been\r\nseen in Jerusalem since the time of Solomon. He also built cities, and\r\ndiverted the course of the river Gihar to the western side of his capital,\r\nand made pools and conduits. It was in these years of prosperity that he\r\nreceived the embassadors of the king of Babylon, and showed unto them his\r\nriches, which led to his rebuke by Isaiah, and the prophecy of the future\r\ncaptivity of his people.\r\n\r\n(M138) He was succeeded by his son, Manasseh, B.C. 698, who reigned\r\nfifty-five years; but he did not follow out the policy of his father, or\r\nimitate his virtues. He restored idolatry, and “worshiped all the hosts of\r\nheaven,” and built altars to them, as Ahab had done in Samaria. He was\r\nalso cruel and tyrannical, and shed much innocent blood; wherefore, for\r\nthese and other infamous sins, the Lord, through the mouth of the\r\nprophets, declared that “he would wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish,”\r\nand would deliver the people into the hands of their enemies.\r\n\r\n(M139) His son, Amon, followed in the steps of his father, but after a\r\nbrief reign of two years, was killed by his servants, B.C. 639, and was\r\nburied in the sepulchre of his family, in the garden of Uzza.\r\n\r\n(M140) Then followed the noble reign of Josiah—the last independent king\r\nof Judah—whose piety and zeal in destroying idolatry, and great reforms,\r\nhave made him the most memorable of all the successors of David. He\r\nrepaired the temple, and utterly destroyed every vestige of idolatry,\r\nassisted by the high priest Hilkiah, who seems to have been his prime\r\nminister. He kept the great feast of the passover with more grandeur than\r\nhad ever been known, either in the days of the judges, or of the kings,\r\nhis ancestors; nor did any king ever equal him in his fidelity to the laws\r\nof Moses. But notwithstanding all his piety and zeal, God was not to be\r\nturned from chastising Judah for the sins of Manasseh, and the repeated\r\nidolatries of his people; and all that Josiah could secure was a promise\r\nfrom the Lord that the calamities of his country should not happen in his\r\nday.\r\n\r\n(M141) In the thirty-first year of his reign, Necho, the king of Egypt,\r\nmade war against the king of Babylon, who had now established his empire\r\non the banks of the Euphrates, over the ruins of the old Assyrian\r\nmonarchy. Josiah rashly embarked in the contest, either with a view of\r\ngiving his aid to the king of Babylon, or to prevent the march of Necho,\r\nwhich lay through the great plain of Esdrælon. Josiah, heedless of all\r\nwarnings, ventured in person against the Egyptian army, though in\r\ndisguise, and was slain by an arrow. His dead body was brought to\r\nJerusalem, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers; and all\r\nJudah and Israel mourned for the loss of one of the greatest, and\r\ncertainly the best of their kings.\r\n\r\nThe prophet Jeremiah pronounced his eulogy, and led the lamentations of\r\nthe people for this great calamity, B.C. 608.\r\n\r\n(M142) The people proclaimed one of his sons, Shallum, to be king, under\r\nthe name of Jehoahaz, but the Egyptian conqueror deposed him and set up\r\nhis brother Jehoiakim as a tributary vassal. He reigned ingloriously for\r\neleven years—an idolator and a tyrant.\r\n\r\n(M143) In his days Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up against him,\r\nhaving driven the Egyptians out of Palestine. Jehoiakim made his\r\nsubmission to the conqueror of Egypt, who now reigned over the whole\r\nAssyrian empire, but did not escape captivity in Babylon, with many other\r\nof the first men of the nation, including Daniel, and the spoil of\r\nJerusalem. He was restored to the throne, on promise of paying a large\r\ntribute. He served the king of Babylon three years and then rebelled,\r\nhoping to secure the assistance of Egypt. But he leaned on a broken reed.\r\nA Chaldean army laid siege to Jerusalem, and Jehoiakim was killed in a\r\nsally, B.C. 597. His son Jehoiachin had reigned only three months when\r\nNebuchadnezzar, a great general, came to carry on the siege in person. The\r\ncity fell, the king was carried into captivity, with 10,000 of his\r\nsubjects, among whom were Ezekiel and Mordecai, and only the poorer class\r\nremained behind. Over these people Nebuchadnezzar set up Zedekiah, the\r\nyoungest son of Josiah, as tributary king. Yet even in this state of\r\ndegradation and humiliation the Jews, wrought upon by false prophets,\r\nexpected deliverance, against the solemn warnings of Jeremiah, who\r\nremained at Jerusalem. Zedekiah, encouraged by the partial successes of\r\nthe Egyptians, rebelled, upon which the king of Babylon resolved upon the\r\ncomplete conquest and utter ruin of the country. Jerusalem fell into his\r\nhands, by assault, and was leveled with the ground, and the temple was\r\ndestroyed. Zedekiah, in attempting to escape, was taken, had his eyes put\r\nout, and was carried captive to Babylon, together with the whole nation,\r\nand the country was reduced to utter desolation. It was not, however,\r\nrepeopled by heathen settlers, as was Samaria. The small remnant that\r\nremained, under the guidance of Jeremiah, recovered some civil rights, and\r\nsupported themselves by the cultivation of the land, and in their bitter\r\nmisery learned those lessons which prepared them for a renewed prosperity\r\nafter the seventy years captivity. Never afterward was idolatry practiced\r\nby the Jews. But no nation was ever more signally humiliated and\r\nprostrated. Can we hence wonder at the mournful strains of Jeremiah, or\r\nthe bitter tears which the captive Jews, now slaves, shed by the rivers of\r\nBabylon when they remembered the old prosperity of Zion.\r\n\r\n(M144) The Jewish monarchy ended by the capture of Zedekiah. The kingdom\r\nof the ten tribes had already fallen to the same foes, and even more\r\ndisastrously, because the kings of Israel were uniformly wicked, without a\r\nsingle exception, and were hopelessly sunk into idolatry; whereas the\r\nkings of Judah were good as well as evil, and some of them were\r\nillustrious for virtues and talents. The descendants of David reigned in\r\nJerusalem in an unbroken dynasty for more than 500 years, while the\r\nmonarchs of Samaria were a succession of usurpers. The degenerate kings\r\nwere frequently succeeded by the captains of their guards, who in turn\r\ngave way for other usurpers, all of whom were bad. The dynasty of David\r\nwas uninterrupted to the captivity of the nation. And the kingdom of Judah\r\nwas also more powerful and prosperous than that of the ten tribes, in\r\nspite of their superior numbers.\r\n\r\n(M145) But it is time to consider these ten tribes which revolted under\r\nJeroboam. Their history is uninteresting, and, were it not for the\r\nbeautiful episodes which relate to the prophets who were sent to reclaim\r\nthe people from idolatry, would be without significance other than that\r\nwhich is drawn from the lives of wicked and idolatrous kings.\r\n\r\n(M146) Jeroboam commenced his reign B.C. 975, by setting up for worship\r\ntwo golden calves in Bethel and Dan, and thus inaugurated idolatry: for\r\nwhich his dynasty was short. His son Nadah was murdered in a military\r\nrevolution, B.C. 953, and the usurper of his throne, Baasha, destroyed his\r\nwhole house. He, too, was a wicked prince, and his son Elah was slain by\r\nZimri, captain of his guard, who now reigned over Israel, after\r\nexterminating the whole family of Elah, but was in his turn assassinated\r\nafter a reign of seven years, B.C. 929. Omri, the captain of the guard,\r\nwas now raised by the voice of the people to the throne; but he had a\r\nrival in Tibni, whom he succeeded in conquering. Omri reigned twelve\r\nyears, and bought the hill of Samaria, on which he built the capital of\r\nhis kingdom. But he exceeded all his predecessors in iniquity, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son Ahab, who reigned twenty-two years. He was the most\r\ninfamous of all the kings of Israel, both for cruelty and idolatry, and\r\nhis queen, Jezebel, was also unique in crime—the Messalina and Fredigonde\r\nof her age. It was through her influence that the worship of Baal became\r\nthe established religion, thus showing that the general influence of woman\r\non man is evil whenever she is not Christian. And this is perhaps the\r\nreason that the ancients represented women as worse than men.\r\n\r\n(M147) It was during the reign of this wicked king that God raised up the\r\ngreatest of the ancient prophets—Elijah, and sent him to Ahab with the\r\nstern intelligence that there should be no rain until the prophet himself\r\nshould invoke it. After three years of grievous famine, during which he\r\nsought to destroy the man who prophesied so much evil, but who was\r\nmiraculously fed in his flight by the ravens, Ahab allowed Elijah to do\r\nhis will.\r\n\r\n(M148) Thereupon he caused the king to assemble together the whole people\r\nof Israel, through their representatives, upon Mount Carmel, together with\r\nthe four hundred and fifty priests of Baal, and the four hundred false\r\nprophets of the grove, whom Jezebel supported. He then invoked the people,\r\nwho, it seems, vacillated in their opinions in respect to Jehovah and\r\nBaal, to choose finally, of these two deities, the God whom they _would_\r\nworship. Having discomfited the priests of Baal in the trial of\r\nsacrifices, and mocked them with the fiercest irony, thereby showing to\r\nthe people how they had been imposed upon, Elijah incited them to the\r\nslaughter of these false prophets and foreign priests, and then set up an\r\naltar to the true God. But all the people had not fallen into idolatry;\r\nthere still had remained seven thousand who had not bowed unto Baal.\r\n\r\n(M149) Rain descended almost immediately, and Ahab departed, and told\r\nJezebel what had transpired. Hereupon, she was transported with rage and\r\nfury, and sought the life of the prophet. He again escaped, and by divine\r\ncommand went to the wilderness of Damascus and anointed Hazael to be king\r\nover Syria, and Jehu to be king over Israel, and Elisha to be his\r\nsuccessor as prophet.\r\n\r\n(M150) Soon after this, Benhadad, the king of Syria, came from Damascus\r\nwith a vast army and thirty-two allied kings, to besiege Samaria. Defeated\r\nin a battle with Ahab, the king of Syria fled, but returned the following\r\nyear with a still larger army for the conquest of Samaria. But he was\r\nagain defeated, with the loss of one hundred thousand men in a single day,\r\nand sought to make peace with the king of Israel. Ahab made a treaty with\r\nhim, instead of taking his life, for which the prophet of the Lord\r\npredicted evil upon him and his people. But the anger of God was still\r\nfurther increased by the slaughter of Naboth, through the wiles of\r\nJezebel, and the unjust possession of the vineyard which Ahab had coveted.\r\nElijah, after this outrage on all the fundamental laws of the Jews, met\r\nthe king for the last time, and pronounced a dreadful penalty—that his own\r\nroyal blood should be licked up by dogs in the very place where Naboth was\r\nslain, and that his posterity should be cut off from reigning over Israel;\r\nalso, that his wicked queen should be eaten by dogs.\r\n\r\n(M151) In three years after, while attempting to recover Ramoth, in\r\nGilead, from Benhadad, he lost his life, and was brought in his chariot to\r\nSamaria to be buried. And the dogs came and licked the blood from the\r\nchariot where it was washed. He was succeeded by Ahaziah, his son, B.C.\r\n913, who renewed the worship of Baal, and died after a short and\r\ninglorious reign, B.C. 896, without leaving any son, and Jehoram, his\r\nbrother, succeeded him. In reference to this king the Scripture accounts\r\nare obscure, and he is sometimes confounded with Jehoram, the son of\r\nJehoshaphat, king of Judah, who married a daughter of Ahab. This accounts\r\nfor the alliance between Jehoshaphat and Ahab, and also between the two\r\nJehorams, since they were brothers-in-law, which brought to an end the\r\nlong wars of seventy years, which had wasted both Israel and Judah.\r\n\r\nJehoram did evil in the sight of the Lord, but was not disgraced by\r\nidolatry. In his reign the Moabites, who paid a tribute of one hundred\r\nthousand sheep and one hundred thousand lambs, revolted. Jehoram, assisted\r\nby the kings of Judah, and of Edom, marched against them, and routed them,\r\nand destroyed their cities, and filled up their wells, and felled all\r\ntheir good trees, and covered their good land with stones.\r\n\r\n(M152) Meanwhile, it happened that there was a grievous famine in Samaria,\r\nso that an ass’s head sold for eighty pieces of silver. Benhadad, in this\r\ntime of national distress, came with mighty host and besieged the city;\r\nbut in the night, in his camp was heard a mighty sound of chariots and\r\nhorses, and a panic ensued, and the Syrians fled, leaving every thing\r\nbehind them. The spoil of their camp furnished the starving Samaritans\r\nwith food.\r\n\r\n(M153) After this, Jehoram was engaged in war with the Syrians, now ruled\r\nby Hazael, one of the generals of Benhadad, who had murdered his master.\r\nIn this war, Jehoram, or Joram, was wounded, and went to be healed of his\r\nwounds at Jezreel, where he was visited by his kinsman, Ahaziah, who had\r\nsucceeded to the throne of Judah. While he lay sick in this place, Jehu,\r\none of his generals, conspired against him, and drew a bow against him,\r\nand the arrow pierced him so that he died, and his body was cast into\r\nNaboth’s vineyard. Thus was the sin against Naboth again avenged. Jehu\r\nprosecuted the work of vengeance assigned to him, and slew Ahaziah, the\r\nking of Judah, also, and then caused Jezebel, the queen mother, to be\r\nthrown from a window, and the dogs devoured her body. He then slew the\r\nseventy sons of Ahab, and all his great men, and his kinsfolk, and his\r\npriests, so that none remained of the house of Ahab, as Elijah had\r\npredicted. His zeal did not stop here, but he collected together, by\r\nartifice, all the priests of Baal, and smote them, and brake their images.\r\n\r\n(M154) But Jehu, now king of Israel, though he had destroyed the priests\r\nof Baal, fell into the idolatry of Jehoram, and was therefore inflicted\r\nwith another invasion of the Syrians, who devastated his country, and\r\ndecimated his people. He died, after a reign of twenty-eight years, B.C.\r\n856, and was succeeded by his son, Jehoahaz.\r\n\r\n(M155) This king also did evil in the sight of the Lord, so that he was\r\nmade subject to Hazael, king of Syria, all his days, who ground down and\r\noppressed Israel, as the prophet had predicted. He reigned seventeen\r\nyears, in sorrow and humiliation, and was succeeded by his son Johash, who\r\nfollowed the wicked course of his predecessors. His reign lasted sixteen\r\nyears, during which Elisha died. There is nothing in the Scriptures more\r\nimpressive than the stern messages which this prophet, as well as Elijah,\r\nsent to the kings of Israel, and the bold rebukes with which he reproached\r\nthem. Nor is anything more beautiful than those episodes which pertain to\r\nthe cure of Naaman, the Syrian, and the restoration to life of the son of\r\nthe Shunamite woman, in reward for her hospitality, and the interview with\r\nHazael before he became king. All his predictions came to pass. He seems\r\nto have lived an isolated and ascetic life, though he had great influence\r\nwith the people and the king, like other prophets of the Lord.\r\n\r\n(M156) Jeroboam II. succeeded Johash, B.C. 825, and reigned successfully,\r\nand received all the territory which the Syrians had gained, but he did\r\nnot depart from the idolatry of the golden calves. His son and successor,\r\nZachariah, followed his evil courses, and was slain by Shallum, after a\r\nbrief reign of six mouths, and the dynasty of Jehu came to an end, B.C.\r\n772.\r\n\r\n(M157) Shallum was murdered one month afterward by Menahem, who reigned\r\ningloriously ten years. It was during his reign that Pul, king of Assyria,\r\ninvaded his territories, but was induced to retire for a sum of one\r\nthousand talents of silver, which he exacted from his subjects. He was\r\nsucceeded by Pekaiah, a bad prince, who was assassinated at the end of two\r\nyears by Pekah, one of his captains, who seized his throne. During his\r\nreign, which lasted twenty years, Tiglath-Pilaser, king of Assyria, made\r\nwar against him, by invitation of Ahaz, and took his principal cities, and\r\ncarried their inhabitants captive to Nineveh. He was assassinated by\r\nHosea, who reigned in his stead. He also was a bad prince, and became\r\nsubject to Shalmanezer, king of Assyria, who came up against him. In the\r\nninth year of his reign, having proved treacherous to Shalmanezer, the\r\nking of Assyria besieged Samaria, and carried him captive to his own\r\ncapital. Thus ended the kingdom of the ten tribes, who were now carried\r\ninto captivity beyond the Euphrates, and who settled in the eastern\r\nprovinces of Assyria, and probably relapsed hopelessly into idolatry,\r\nwithout ever revisiting their native laud. In all probability most of them\r\nwere absorbed among the nations which composed the Assyrian empire, B.C.\r\n721.\r\n\r\n(M158) Nineteen sovereigns thus reigned over the children of Israel in\r\nSamaria—a period of two hundred and fifty-four years; not one of them was\r\nobedient to the laws of God, and most of whom perished by assassination,\r\nor in battle. There is no record in history of more inglorious kings.\r\nThere was not a great man nor a good man among them all. They were, with\r\none or two exceptions, disgraced by the idolatry of Jeroboam, in whose\r\nsteps they followed. Nor was their kingdom ever raised to any considerable\r\nheight of political power. The history of the revolted and idolatrous\r\ntribes is gloomy and disgraceful, only relieved by the stern lives of\r\nElijah and Elisha, the only men of note who remained true to the God of\r\ntheir fathers, and who sought to turn the people from their sins.\r\n“Whereupon the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of\r\nhis sight.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD CHALDEAN AND ASSYRIAN MONARCHIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M159) On a great plain, four hundred miles in length and one hundred\r\nmiles in width, forming the valley of the Euphrates, bounded on the north\r\nby Mesopotamia, on the east by the Tigris, on the south by the Persian\r\nGulf, and on the west by the Syrian Desert, was established, at a very\r\nearly period, the Babylonian monarchy. This plain, or valley, contains\r\nabout twenty-three thousand square miles, equal to the Grecian\r\nterritories. It was destitute of all striking natural features—furnishing\r\nan unbroken horizon. The only interruptions to the view on this level\r\nplain were sand-hills and the embankments of the river. The river, like\r\nthe Nile, is subject to inundations, though less regular than the Nile,\r\nand this, of course, deposits a rich alluvial soil. The climate in summer\r\nis intensely hot, and in winter mild and genial. Wheat here is indigenous,\r\nand the vine and other fruits abound in rich luxuriance. The land was as\r\nrich as the valley of the Nile, and was favorable to flocks and herds. The\r\nriver was stocked with fish, and every means of an easy subsistence was\r\nafforded.\r\n\r\n(M160) Into this goodly land a migration from Armenia—the primeval seat of\r\nman—came at a period when history begins. Nimrod and his hunters then\r\ngained an ascendency over the old settlers, and supplanted them—Cushites,\r\nof the family of Ham, and not the descendants of Shem. The beginning of\r\nthe kingdom of Nimrod was Babel, a tower, or temple, modeled after the one\r\nwhich was left unfinished, or was destroyed. This was erected, probably,\r\nB.C. 2334. It was square, and arose with successive stories, each one\r\nsmaller than the one below, presenting an analogy to the pyramidical form.\r\nThe highest stage supported the sacred ark. The temple was built of burnt\r\nbrick. Thus the race of Ham led the way in the arts in Chaldea as in\r\nEgypt, and soon fell into idolatry. We know nothing, with certainty, of\r\nthis ancient monarchy, which lasted, it is supposed, two hundred and\r\nfifty-eight years, from B.C. 2234 to 1976. It was not established until\r\nafter the dispersion of the races. The dynasty of which Nimrod was the\r\nfounder came to an end during the early years of Abraham.\r\n\r\n(M161) The first king of the new dynasty is supposed to be Chedorlaomer,\r\nthough Josephus represents him as a general of the Chaldean king who\r\nextended the Chaldean conquests to Palestine. His encounters with the\r\nkings of Sodom, Gomorrah, and others in the vale of Siddim, tributary\r\nprinces, and his slaughter by Abraham’s servants, are recounted in the\r\nfourteenth chapter of Genesis, and put an end to Chaldean conquests beyond\r\nthe Syrian desert. From his alliance, however, with the Tidal, king of\r\nnations; Amrapher, king of Shinar; and Arioch, king of Ellasar, we infer\r\nthat other races, besides the Hamite, composed the population of Chaldea,\r\nof which the subjects of Chedorlaomer were pre-eminent.\r\n\r\nHis empire was subverted by Arabs from the desert, B.C. 1518; and an\r\nArabian dynasty is supposed to have reigned for two hundred and forty-five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n(M162) This came to an end in consequence of a grand irruption of\r\nAssyrians—of Semitic origin. “Asshur (Gen. 10, 11), the son of Shem, built\r\nNineveh,” which was on the Tigris. The name Assyria came to be extended to\r\nthe whole of Upper Mesopotamia, from the Euphrates to the Tagros\r\nmountains. This country consisted of undulating pastures, diversified by\r\nwoodlands, and watered by streams running into the Tigris. Its valleys\r\nwere rich, its hills were beautiful, and its climate was cooler than the\r\nChaldean plain.\r\n\r\n(M163) It would seem from the traditions preserved by the Greeks, that\r\nNineveh was ruled by a viceroy of the Babylonian king. This corresponds\r\nwith the book of Genesis, which makes the dynasty Chaldean, while the\r\npeople were Semitic, since the kingdom of Asshur was derived from that of\r\nNimrod. “Ninus, the viceroy,” says Smith, “having revolted from the king\r\nof Babylon, overruns Armenia, Asia Minor, and the shores of the Euxine, as\r\nfar as Tanais, subdues the Medes and Persians, and makes war upon the\r\nBactrians. Semiramis, the wife of one of the chief nobles, coming to the\r\ncamp before Bactria, takes the city by a bold stroke. Her courage wins the\r\nlove of Ninus, and she becomes his wife. On his death she succeeds to the\r\nthrone, and undertakes the conquest of India, but is defeated.” These two\r\nsovereigns built Nineveh on a grand scale, as well as added to the\r\nedifices of Babylon.\r\n\r\nThis king was the founder of the northwest palace of Nineveh, three\r\nhundred and sixty feet long and three hundred wide, standing on a raised\r\nplatform overlooking the Tigris, with a grand facade to the north fronting\r\nthe town, and another to the west commanding the river. It was built of\r\nhewn stone, and its central hall was one hundred and twenty feet long and\r\nninety wide. The ceilings were of cedar brought from Lebanon. The walls\r\nwere paneled with slabs of marble ornamented with bas-reliefs. The floors\r\nwere paved with stone. (See Rawlinson’s Herodotus.)\r\n\r\n(M164) All this is tradition, but recent discoveries in cuneiform\r\nliterature shed light upon it. From these, compared with the fragments of\r\nBerosus, a priest of Babylon in the third century before Christ, and the\r\nscattered notices of Scripture history, we infer that the dynasty which\r\nBelus founded reigned more than five hundred years, from 1272 to 747\r\nbefore Christ. Of these kings, Sardanapalus, the most famous, added\r\nBabylonia to the Assyrian empire, and built vast architectural works. He\r\nemployed three hundred and sixty thousand men in the construction of this\r\npalace, some of whom were employed in making brick, and others in cutting\r\ntimber on Mount Hermon. It covered an area of eight acres. The palaces of\r\nNineveh were of great splendor, and the scenes portrayed on the walls, as\r\ndiscovered by Mr. Layard, lately disinterred from the mounds of earth,\r\nrepresent the king as of colossal stature, fighting battles, and clothed\r\nwith symbolic attributes. He appears as a great warrior, leading captives,\r\nand storming cities, and also in the chase, piercing the lion, and\r\npursuing the wild ass. This monarch should not be confounded with the\r\nSardanapalus of the Greeks, the last of the preceding dynasty. His son,\r\nShalmanezer, was also a great prince, and added to the dominion of the\r\nAssyrian empire. Distant nations paid tribute to him, the Phœnicians, the\r\nSyrians, the Jews, and the Medians beyond the Tagros mountains. He\r\ndefeated Benhadad and routed Hazael. His reign ended, it is supposed, B.C.\r\n850. Two other kings succeeded him, who extended their conquests to the\r\nwest, the last of whom is identified by Smith with Pul, the reigning\r\nmonarch when Jonah visited Nineveh, B.C. 770.\r\n\r\nThe next dynasty commences with Tiglath-Pileser II., who carried on wars\r\nagainst Babylon and Syria and Israel. This was in the time of Ahaz, B.C.\r\n729.\r\n\r\n(M165) His son, Shalmanezer, made Hosea, king of Israel, his vassal, and\r\nreduced the country of the ten tribes to a province of his empire, and\r\ncarried the people away into captivity. Hezekiah was also, for a time, his\r\nvassal. He was succeeded by Sargon, B.C. 721, according to Smith, but 715\r\nB.C., according to others. He reigned, as Geseneus thinks, but two or\r\nthree years; but fifteen according to Rawlinson, and built that splendid\r\npalace, the ruins of which, at Khorsabad, have supplied the Louvre with\r\nits choicest remains of Assyrian antiquity. He was one of the greatest of\r\nthe Assyrian conquerors. He invaded Babylon and drove away its kings; he\r\ndefeated the Philistines, took Ashdod and Tyre, received tribute from the\r\nGreeks at Cyprus, invaded even Egypt, whose king paid him tribute, and\r\nconquered Media.\r\n\r\n(M166) His son, Sennacherib, who came to the throne, B.C. 702, is an\r\ninteresting historical personage, and under him the Assyrian empire\r\nreached its culminating point. He added to the palace of Nineveh, and\r\nbuilt one which exceeded all that had existed before him. No monarch\r\nsurpassed this one in the magnificence of his buildings. He erected no\r\nless than thirty temples, shining with silver and gold. One of the halls\r\nof his palace was two hundred and twenty feet long, and one hundred and\r\none wide. He made use of Syrian, Greek, and Phœnician artists. It is from\r\nthe ruins of this palace at _Koyunjik_ that Mr. Layard made those valuable\r\ndiscoveries which have enriched the British Museum. He subdued Babylonia,\r\nUpper Mesopotamia, Syria, Phœnicia, Philistia, Idumaen, and a part of\r\nEgypt, which, with Media, a part of Armenia, and the old Assyrian\r\nterritory, formed his vast empire—by far greater than the Egyptian\r\nmonarchy at any period. He chastised also the Jews for encouraging a\r\nrevolt among the Philistines, and carried away captive two hundred\r\nthousand people, and only abstained from laying siege to Jerusalem by a\r\npresent from Hezekiah of three hundred talents of silver and thirty of\r\ngold. The destruction of his host, as recorded by Scripture, is thought by\r\nsome to have occurred in a subsequent invasion of Judea, when it was in\r\nalliance with Egypt. That “he returned to Nineveh and dwelt there” is\r\nasserted by Scripture, but only to be assassinated by his sons, B.C. 680.\r\n\r\nHis son Esar-Haddon succeeded him, a warlike monarch, who fought the\r\nEgyptians, and colonized Samaria with Babylonian settlers. He also built\r\nthe palace of Nimrod, and cultivated art.\r\n\r\n(M167) The civilization of the Assyrians shows a laborious and patient\r\npeople. Its chief glory was in architecture. Sculpture was imitated from\r\nnature, but had neither the grace nor the ideality of the Greeks. War was\r\nthe grand business of kings, and hunting their pleasure. The people were\r\nground down by the double tyranny of kings and priests. There is little of\r\ninterest in the Assyrian annals, and what little we know of their life and\r\nmanners is chiefly drawn by inductions from the monuments excavated by\r\nBotta and Layard. The learned treatise of Rawlinson sheds a light on the\r\nannals of the monarchy, which, before the discoveries of Layard, were\r\nexceedingly obscure, and this treatise has been most judiciously abridged,\r\nby Smith, whom I have followed. It would be interesting to consider the\r\nmythology of the Assyrians, but it is too complicated for a work like\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n(M168) Under his successors, the empire rapidly declined. Though it\r\nnominally included the whole of Western Asia, from the Mediterranean to\r\nthe desert of Iran, and from the Caspian Sea and the mountains of Armenia\r\nto the Persian Gulf, it was wanting in unity. It embraced various\r\nkingdoms, and cities, and tribes, which simply paid tribute, limited by\r\nthe power of the king to enforce it. The Assyrian armies, which committed\r\nso great devastations, did not occupy the country they chastised, as the\r\nRomans and Greeks did. Their conquests were like those of Tamerlane. As\r\nthe monarchs became effeminated, new powers sprung up, especially Media,\r\nwhich ultimately completed the ruin of Assyria, under Cyaxares. The last\r\nof the monarchs was probably the Sardanapalus of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n(M169) The decline of this great monarchy was so rapid and complete, that\r\neven Nineveh, the capital city, was blotted out of existence. No traces of\r\nit remained in the time of Herodotus, and it is only from recent\r\nexcavations that its site is known. Still, it must have been a great city.\r\nThe eastern wall of it, as it now appears from the excavations, is fifteen\r\nthousand nine hundred feet (about three miles); but the city probably\r\nincluded vast suburbs, with fortified towers, so as to have been equal to\r\nfour hundred and eighty stadias in circumference, or sixty miles—the three\r\ndays’ journey of Jonah. It is supposed, with the suburbs, to have\r\ncontained five hundred thousand people. The palaces of the great were\r\nlarge and magnificent; but the dwellings of the people were mean, built of\r\nbrick dried in the sun. The palaces consisted of a large number of\r\nchambers around a central hall, open to the sky, since no pillars are\r\nfound necessary to support a roof. No traces of windows are found in the\r\nwalls, which were lined with slabs of coarse marble, with cuneiform\r\ninscriptions. The façade of the palaces we know little about, except that\r\nthe entrances to them were lined by groups of colossal bulls. These are\r\nsculptured with considerable spirit, but _art_, in the sense that the\r\nGreeks understood it, did not exist. In the ordinary appliances of life\r\nthe Assyrians were probably on a par with the Egyptians; but they were\r\ndebased by savage passions and degrading superstitions. They have left\r\nnothing for subsequent ages to use. Nothing which has contributed to\r\ncivilization remains of their existence. They have furnished no _models_\r\nof literature, art, or government.\r\n\r\n(M170) While Nineveh was rising to greatness, Babylon was under an\r\neclipse, and thus lasted six hundred and fifty years. It was in the year\r\n1273 that this eclipse began. But a great change took place in the era of\r\nNarbonassar, B.C. 747, when Babylon threatened to secure its independence,\r\nand which subsequently compelled Esar-Haddon, the Assyrian monarch, to\r\nassume, in his own person, the government of Babylon, B.C. 680.\r\n\r\n(M171) In 625 B.C. the old Chaldeans recovered their political importance,\r\nprobably by an alliance with the Medes, and Nabopolassar obtained\r\nundisputed possession of Babylon, and founded a short but brilliant\r\ndynasty. He obtained a share of the captives of Nineveh, and increased the\r\npopulation of his capital. His son, Nebuchadnezzar, was sent as general\r\nagainst the Egyptians, and defeated their king, Neko, reconquered all the\r\nlands bordering on Egypt, and received the submission of Jehoiakim, of\r\nJerusalem. The death of Nabopolassar recalled his son to Babylon, and his\r\ngreat reign began B.C. 604.\r\n\r\n(M172) It was he who enlarged the capital to so great an extent that he\r\nmay almost be said to have built it. It was in the form of a square, on\r\nboth banks of the Euphrates, forty-eight miles in circuit, according to\r\nHerodotus, with an area of two hundred square miles—large enough to\r\nsupport a considerable population by agriculture alone. The walls of this\r\ncity, if we accept the testimony of Herodotus, were three hundred and\r\nfifty feet high, and eighty-seven feet thick, and were strengthened by two\r\nhundred and fifty towers, and pierced with one hundred gates of brass. The\r\nriver was lined by quays, and the two parts of the city were united by a\r\nstone bridge, at each end of which was a fortified palace. The greatest\r\nwork of the royal architect was the new palace, with the adjoining hanging\r\ngarden—a series of terraces to resemble hills, to please his Median queen.\r\nThis palace, with the garden, was eight miles in circumference, and\r\nsplendidly decorated with statues of men and animals. Here the mighty\r\nmonarch, after his great military expeditions, solaced himself, and\r\ndreamed of omnipotence, until a sudden stroke of madness—that form which\r\ncauses a man to mistake himself for a brute animal—sent him from his\r\nluxurious halls into the gardens he had planted. His madness lasted seven\r\nyears, and he died, after a reign of forty-three years, B.C. 561, and\r\nEvil-Merodach, his son, reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n(M173) He was put to death two years after, for lawlessness and\r\nintemperance, and was succeeded by his brother-in-law and murderer,\r\nNeriglissar. So rapid was the decline of the monarchy, that after a few\r\nbrief reigns Babylon was entered by the army of Cyrus, and the last king,\r\nBil-shar-utzur, or Bilshassar, associated with his father Nabonadius, was\r\nslain, B.C. 538. Thus ended the Chaldean monarchy, seventeen hundred and\r\nninety-six years after the building of Babel by Nimrod, according to the\r\nchronology it is most convenient to assume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPIRE OF THE MEDES AND PERSIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M174) The third of the great Oriental monarchies brought in contact with\r\nthe Jews was that of the Medes and Persians, which arose on the\r\ndissolution of the Assyrian and Babylonian empires. The nations we have\r\nhitherto alluded to were either Hamite or Shemite. But our attention is\r\nnow directed to a different race, the descendants of Japhet. Madai, the\r\nthird son of Japhet, was the progenitor of the Medes, whose territory\r\nextended from the Caspian Sea on the north, to the mountains of Persia on\r\nthe south, and from the highlands of Armenia and the chain of Tagros on\r\nthe west, to the great desert of Iran on the east. It comprised a great\r\nvariety of climate, and was intersected by mountains whose valleys were\r\nfruitful in corn and fruits. “The finest part of the country is an\r\nelevated region inclosed by the offshoots of the Armenian mountains, and\r\nsurrounding the basin of the great lake Urumizu, four thousand two hundred\r\nfeet above the sea, and the valleys of the ancient Mardus and the Araxes,\r\nthe northern boundary of the land. In this mountain region stands Tabris,\r\nthe delightful summer seat of the modern Persian shahs. The slopes of the\r\nTagros furnish excellent pasture; and here were reared the famous horses\r\nwhich the ancients called Nisæan. The eastern districts are flat and\r\npestilential, where they sink down to the shores of the Caspian Sea;\r\nrugged and sterile where they adjoin the desert of Iran.” The people who\r\ninhabited this country were hardy and bold, and were remarkable for their\r\nhorsemanship. They were the greatest warriors of the ancient world, until\r\nthe time of the Greeks. They were called Aryans by Herodotus. They had\r\nspread over the highlands of Western Asia in the primeval ages, and formed\r\nvarious tribes. The first notice of this Aryan (or Arian) race, appears in\r\nthe inscriptions on the black obelisk of Nimrod, B.C. 880, from which it\r\nwould appear that this was about the period of the immigration into Media,\r\nand they were then exposed to the aggressions of the Assyrians. “The first\r\nking who menaced their independence was the monarch whose victories are\r\nrecorded on the black obelisk in the British Museum.” He made a raid into,\r\nrather than a conquest of, the Median country. Sargon, the third monarch\r\nof the Lower Empire, effected something like a conquest, and peopled the\r\ncities which he founded with Jewish captives from Samaria, B.C. 710. Media\r\nthus became the most eastern province of his empire, but the conquest of\r\nit was doubtless incomplete. The Median princes paid tribute to the kings\r\nof Nineveh, or withheld it, according to their circumstances.\r\n\r\n(M175) According to Ctesias, the Median monarchy commenced B.C. 875; but\r\nHerodotus, with greater probable accuracy, places the beginning of it B.C.\r\n708. The revolt of Media from Assyria was followed by the election of\r\nDeioces, who reigned fifty-three years. The history of this king is drawn\r\nthrough Grecian sources, and can not much be depended upon. According to\r\nthe legends, the seven tribes of the Medes, scattered over separate\r\nvillages, suffered all the evils of anarchy, till the reputation of\r\nDeioces made him the arbiter of their disputes. He then retired into\r\nprivate life; anarchy returned, a king was called for, and Deioces was\r\nelected. He organized a despotic power, which had its central seat in\r\nEcbatana, which he made his capital, built upon a hill, on the summit of\r\nwhich was the royal palace, where the king reigned in seclusion,\r\ntransacting all business through spies, informers, petitions, and decrees.\r\nSuch is the account which Rawlinson gives, and which Smith follows.\r\n\r\n(M176) The great Median kingdom really began with Cyaxares, about the year\r\nB.C. 633, when the Assyrian empire was waning. He emerges from the\r\nobscurity like Attila and Gengis Khan, and other eastern conquerors, at\r\nthe head of irresistible hordes, sweeps all away before him, and builds up\r\nan enormous power. This period was distinguished by a great movement among\r\nthe Turanian races (Cimmerians), living north of the Danube, which,\r\naccording to Herodotus, made a great irruption into Asia Minor, where some\r\nof the tribes effected a permanent settlement; while the Scythians, from\r\nCentral Asia, overran Media, crossed the Zagros mountains, entered\r\nMesopotamia, passed through Syria to Egypt, and held the dominion of\r\nWestern Asia, till expelled by Cyaxares. He only established his new\r\nkingdom after a severe conflict between the Scythian and Aryan races,\r\nwhich had hitherto shared the possession of the tablelands of Media.\r\n\r\n(M177) From age to age the Turanian races have pressed forward to occupy\r\nthe South, and it was one of these great movements which Cyaxares opposed,\r\nand opposed successfully—the first recorded in history. These nomads of\r\nTartary, or Scythian tribes, which overran Western Asia in the seventh\r\ncentury before Christ, under the new names of Huns, Avari, Bulgarians,\r\nMagyars, Turks, Mongols, devastated Europe and Asia for fifteen successive\r\ncenturies. They have been the scourge of the race, and they commenced\r\ntheir incursions before Grecian history begins.\r\n\r\n(M178) Learning from these Scythian invaders many arts, not before\r\npracticed in war, such as archery and cavalry movements, Cyaxares was\r\nprepared to extend his empire to the west over Armenia and Asia Minor, as\r\nfar as the river Halys. He made war in Lydia with the father of Crœsus.\r\nBut before these conquests were made, he probably captured Nineveh and\r\ndestroyed it, B.C. 625. He was here assisted by the whole force of the\r\nBabylonians, under Nabopolassar, an old general of the Assyrians, but who\r\nhad rebelled. In reward he obtained for his son, Nebuchadnezzar, the hand\r\nof the daughter of Cyaxares. The last of the Assyrian monarchs, whom the\r\nGreeks have called Sardanapalus, burned himself in his palace rather than\r\nfall into the hands of the Median conqueror.\r\n\r\n(M179) The fall of Nineveh led to the independence of Babylon, and its\r\nwonderful growth, and also to the conquests of the Medes as far as Lydia\r\nto the west. The war with Lydia lasted six years, and was carried on with\r\nvarious success, until peace was restored by the mediation of a Babylonian\r\nprince. The reason that peace was made was an eclipse of the sun, which\r\nhappened in the midst of a great battle, which struck both armies with\r\nsuperstitious fears. On the conclusion of peace, the son of the Median\r\nking, Astyages, married the daughter of the Lydian monarch, Alyattes, and\r\nan alliance was formed between Media and Lydia.\r\n\r\n(M180) At this time Lydia comprised nearly all of Asia Minor, west of the\r\nHalys. The early history of this country is involved in obscurity. The\r\ndynasty on the throne, when invaded by the Medes, was founded by Gyges,\r\nB.C. 724, who began those aggressions on the Grecian colonies which were\r\nconsummated by Crœsus. Under the reign of Ardys, his successor, Asia Minor\r\nwas devastated by the Cimmerians, a people who came from the regions north\r\nof the Black Sea, between the Danube and the Sea of Azov, being driven\r\naway by an inundation of Scythians, like that which afterward desolated\r\nMedia. These Cimmerians, having burned the great temple of Diana, at\r\nEphesus, and destroyed the capital city of Sardis, were expelled from\r\nLydia by Alyattes, the monarch against whom Cyaxares had made war.\r\n\r\n(M181) Cyaxares reigned forty years, and was succeeded by Astyages, B.C.\r\n593, whose history is a total blank, till near the close of his long reign\r\nof thirty-five years, when the Persians under Cyrus arose to power. He\r\nseems to have resigned himself to the ordinary condition of Oriental\r\nkings—to effeminacy and luxury—brought about by the prosperity which he\r\ninherited. He was contemporary with Crœsus, the famous king of Lydia,\r\nwhose life has been invested with so much romantic interest by\r\nHerodotus—the first of the Asiatic kings who commenced hostile aggression\r\non the Greeks. After making himself master of all the Greek States of Asia\r\nMinor, he combated a power which was destined to overturn the older\r\nmonarchies of the East—that of the Persians—a race closely connected with\r\nthe Medes in race, language, and religion.\r\n\r\n(M182) The Persians first appear in history as a hardy, warlike people,\r\nsimple in manners and scornful of luxury. They were uncultivated in art\r\nand science, but possessed great wit, and a poetical imagination. They\r\nlived in the mountainous region on the southwest of Iran, where the great\r\nplain descends to the Persian Gulf. The sea-coast is hot and arid, as well\r\nas the eastern region where the mountains pass into the table-land of\r\nIran. Between these tracts, resembling the Arabian desert, lie the high\r\nlands at the extremity of the Zagros chain. These rugged regions, rich in\r\nfruitful valleys, are favorable to the cultivation of corn, of the grape,\r\nand fruits, and afford excellent pasturage for flocks. In the northern\r\npart is the beautiful plain of Shiraz, which forms the favorite residence\r\nof the modern shahs. In the valley of Bend-amir was the old capital of\r\nPersepolis, whose ruins attest the magnificent palaces of Darius and\r\nXerxes. Persia proper was a small country, three hundred miles from north\r\nto south, and two hundred and eighty from east to west, inhabited by an\r\nAryan race, who brought with them, from the country beyond the Indus, a\r\ndistinctive religion, language, and political institutions. Their language\r\nwas closely connected with the Aryan dialects of India, and the tongues of\r\nmodern Europe. Hence the Persians were noble types of the great\r\nIndo-European family, whose civilization has spread throughout the world.\r\nTheir religion was the least corrupted of the ancient races, and was\r\nmarked by a keen desire to arrive at truth, and entered, in the time of\r\nthe Gnostics, into the speculations of the Christian fathers, of whom\r\nOrigen was the type. Their teachers were the Magi, a wise and learned\r\ncaste, some of whom came to Jerusalem in the time of Herod, guided by the\r\nstar in the East, to institute inquiries as to the birth of Christ. They\r\nattempted to solve the mysteries of creation, but their elemental\r\nprinciple of religion was worship of all the elements, especially of fire.\r\nBut the Persians also believed in the two principles of good and evil,\r\nwhich were called the principle of dualism, and which they brought from\r\nIndia. It is thought by Rawlinson that the Persians differed in their\r\nreligion from the primeval people of India, whose Vedas, or sacred books,\r\nwere based on monotheism, in its spiritual and personal form, and that,\r\nfor the heresy of “dualism,” they were compelled to migrate to the West.\r\nThe Medes, with whom they subsequently became associated, were inclined to\r\nthe old elemental worship of nature, which they learned from the Turanian\r\nor Scythic population.\r\n\r\n(M183) The great man among the Persians was Zoroaster—or Zerdusht, born,\r\nprobably, B.C. 589. He is immortal, not from his personal history, the\r\ndetails of which we are ignorant, but from his ideas, which became the\r\nbasis of the faith of the Persians. He stamped his mind on the nation, as\r\nMohammed subsequently did upon Arabia. His central principle was\r\n“dualism”—the two powers of good and evil—the former of which was destined\r\nultimately to conquer. But with this dualistic creed of the old Persian,\r\nhe also blended a reformed Magian worship of the elements, which had\r\ngained a footing among the Chaldean priests, and which originally came\r\nfrom the Scythic invaders. Magism could not have come from the Semitic\r\nraces, whose original religion was theism, like that of Melchisedek and\r\nAbraham; nor from the Japhetic races, or Indo-European, whose worship was\r\npolytheism—that of personal gods under distinct names, like Jupiter, Juno,\r\nand Minerva. The first to yield to this Magism were the Medes, who adopted\r\nthe religion of older settlers,—the Scythic tribes, their subjects,—and\r\nwhich faith superseded the old Aryan religion.\r\n\r\n(M184) The Persians, the flower of the Aryan races, were peculiarly\r\nmilitary in all their habits and aspirations. Their nobles, mounted on a\r\nfamous breed of horses, composed the finest cavalry in the world. Nor was\r\ntheir infantry inferior, armed with lances, shields, and bows. Their\r\nmilitary spirit was kept alive by their mountain life and simple habits\r\nand strict discipline.\r\n\r\n(M185) Astyages, we have seen, was the last of the Median kings. He\r\nmarried his daughter, according to Herodotus, to Cambyses, a Persian\r\nnoble, preferring him to a higher alliance among the Median princes, in\r\norder that a dream might not be fulfilled that her offspring should\r\nconquer Asia. On the return of the dream he sought to destroy the child\r\nshe was about to bear, but it was preserved by a herdsman; and when the\r\nchild was ten years of age he was chosen by his playfellows on the\r\nmountains to be their king. As such he caused the son of a noble Median to\r\nbe scourged for disobedience, who carried his complaint to Astyages. The\r\nMedian monarch finds out his pedigree from the herdsman, and his officer,\r\nHarpagns, to whom he had intrusted the commission for his destruction. He\r\ninvites, in suppressed anger, this noble to a feast, at which he serves up\r\nthe flesh of his own son. Harpagus, in revenge, conspires with some\r\ndiscontented nobles, and invites Cyrus, this boy-king, now the bravest of\r\nthe youths of his age and country, to a revolt. Cyrus leads his troops\r\nagainst Astyages, and gains a victory, and also the person of the\r\nsovereign, and his great reign began, B.C. 558.\r\n\r\n(M186) The dethronement of Astyages caused a war between Lydia and Persia.\r\nCrœsus hastens to attack the usurper and defend his father-in-law. He\r\nforms a league with Babylonia and Egypt. Thus the three most powerful\r\nmonarchs of the world are arrayed against Cyrus, who is prepared to meet\r\nthe confederation. Crœsus is defeated, and retreats to his capital,\r\nSardis; and the next spring, while summoning his allies, is attacked\r\nunexpectedly by Cyrus, and is again defeated. He now retires to Sardia,\r\nwhich is strongly fortified, and the city is besieged, by the Persians,\r\nand falls after a brief siege. Crœsus himself is spared, and in his\r\nadversity gives wise counsel to his conqueror.\r\n\r\n(M187) Cyrus leaves a Lydian in command of the captured city, and departs\r\nfor home. A revolt ensues, which leads to a collision between Persia and\r\nthe Greek colonies, and the subjection of the Grecian cities by Harpagus,\r\nthe general of Cyrus. Then followed the conquest of Asia Minor, which\r\nrequired several years, and was conducted by the generals of Cyrus. He was\r\nrequired in Media, to consolidate his power. He then extended his\r\nconquests to the East, and subdued the whole plateau of Iran, to the\r\nmountains which divided it from the Indus. Thus fifteen years of splendid\r\nmilitary successes passed before he laid siege to Babylon, B.C. 538.\r\n\r\n(M188) On the fall of that great city Cyrus took up his residence in it,\r\nas the imperial capital of his vast dominion. Here he issued his decree\r\nfor the return of the Jews to their ancient territory, and for the\r\nrebuilding of their temple, after seventy years’ captivity. This decree\r\nwas dictated by the sound military policy of maintaining the frontier\r\nterritory of Palestine against his enemies in Asia Minor, which he knew\r\nthe Jews would do their best to preserve, and this policy he carried out\r\nwith noble generosity, and returned to the Jews the captured vessels of\r\nsilver and gold which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away; and for more than\r\ntwo centuries Persia had no warmer friends and allies than the obedient\r\nand loyal subjects of Judea.\r\n\r\n(M189) Cyrus fell in battle while fighting a tribe of Scythians at the\r\neast of the Caspian Sea, B.C. 529, He was the greatest general that the\r\nOriental world ever produced, and well may rank with Alexander himself.\r\nHis reign of twenty-nine years was one constant succession of wars, in\r\nwhich he was uniformly successful, and in which success was only equaled\r\nby his magnanimity. His empire extended from the Indus to the Hellespont\r\nand the Syrian coast, far greater than that of either Assyria or\r\nBabylonia.\r\n\r\n(M190) The result of the Persian conquest on the conquerors themselves was\r\nto produce habits of excessive luxury, a wide and vast departure from\r\ntheir original mode of life, which enfeebled the empire, and prepared the\r\nway for a rapid decline.\r\n\r\n(M191) Cambyses, however, the son and successor of Cyrus, carried out his\r\npolicy and conquests. He was, unlike his father, a tyrant and a\r\nsensualist, but possessed considerable military genius. He conquered\r\nPhœnicia, and thus became master of the sea as well as of the land. He\r\nthen quarreled with Amasis, the king of Egypt, and subdued his kingdom.\r\n\r\n(M192) Like an eastern despot, he had, while in Egypt, in an hour of\r\nmadness and caprice, killed his brother, Smerdis. It happened there was a\r\nMagian who bore a striking resemblance to the murdered prince. With the\r\nhelp of his brother, whom the king had left governor of his household,\r\nthis Magian usurped the throne of Persia, while Cambyses was absent, the\r\ndeath of the true Smerdis having been carefully concealed.\r\n\r\n(M193) The news of the usurpation reached Cambyses while returning from an\r\nexpedition to Syria. An accidental wound from the point of his sword\r\nproved mortal, B.C. 522. But Cambyses, about to die, called his nobles\r\naround him, and revealed the murder of his brother, and exhorted them to\r\nprevent the kingdom falling into the hands of the Medes. He left no\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n(M194) The usurper proved a tyrant. A conspiracy of Persians followed,\r\nheaded by the descendants of Cyrus; and Darius, the chief of these—the son\r\nof Hystaspes, became king of Persia, after Smerdis had reigned seven\r\nmonths. But this reign, brief as it was, had restored the old Magian\r\npriests to power, who had, by their magical arts, great popularity with\r\nthe people, not only Medes, but Persians.\r\n\r\n(M195) Darius restored the temples and the worship which the Magian\r\npriests had overthrown, and established the religion of Zoroaster. The\r\nearly years of his reign were disturbed by rebellions in Babylonia and\r\nMedia, but these were suppressed, and Darius prosecuted the conquests\r\nwhich Cyrus had begun. He invaded both India and Scythia, while his\r\ngeneral, Megabazus, subdued Thrace and the Greek cities of the Hellespont.\r\n\r\n(M196) The king of Macedonia acknowledged the supremacy of the great\r\nmonarch of Asia, and gave the customary present of earth and water. Darius\r\nreturned at length to Susa to enjoy the fruit of his victories, and the\r\npleasures which his great empire afforded. For twenty years his glories\r\nwere unparalleled in the East, and his life was tranquil.\r\n\r\n(M197) But in the year B.C. 500, a great revolt of the Ionian cities took\r\nplace. It was suppressed, at first, but the Atticans, at Marathon,\r\ndefeated the Persian warriors, B.C. 490, and the great victory changed the\r\nwhole course of Asiatic conquest. Darius made vast preparations for a new\r\ninvasion of Greece, but died before they were completed, after a reign of\r\nthirty-six years, B.C. 485, leaving a name greater than that of any\r\nOriental sovereign, except Cyrus.\r\n\r\n(M198) Unfortunately for him and his dynasty, he challenged the spirit of\r\nwestern liberty, then at its height among the cities of Greece. His\r\nsuccessor, Xerxes, inherited his power, but not his genius, and rashly\r\nprovoked Europe by new invasions, while he lived ingloriously in his\r\nseraglio. He was murdered in his palace, the fate of the great tyrants of\r\neastern monarchies, for in no other way than by the assassin’s dagger\r\ncould a change of administration take place—a poor remedy, perhaps, but\r\nnot worse than the disease itself. This tyrant was the Ahasuerus of the\r\nScriptures.\r\n\r\n(M199) We need not follow the fortunes of the imbecile princes who\r\nsucceeded Xerxes, for the Persian monarchy was now degenerate and\r\nweakened, and easily fell under the dominion of Alexander, who finally\r\noverthrew the power of Persia, B.C. 330.\r\n\r\n(M200) And this was well. The Persian monarchy was an absolute despotism,\r\nlike that of Turkey, and the monarch not only controlled the actions of\r\nhis subjects, but was the owner even of their soil. He delegated his power\r\nto satraps, who ruled during his pleasure, but whose rule was disgraced by\r\nevery form of extortion—sometimes punished, however, when it became\r\noutrageous and notorious. The satraps, like pashas, were virtually\r\nindependent princes, and exercised all the rights of sovereigns so long as\r\nthey secured the confidence of the supreme monarch, and regularly remitted\r\nto him the tribute which was imposed. The satrapies were generally given\r\nto members of the royal family, or to great nobles connected with it by\r\nmarriage. The monarch governed by no council, and the laws centered in the\r\nprinciple that the will of the king was supreme. The only check which he\r\nfeared was assassination, and he generally spent his life in the\r\nretirement of his seraglio, at Susa, Babylon, or Ecbatana.\r\n\r\nThe Persian empire was the last of the great monarchies of the Oriental\r\nworld, and these flourished for a period of two thousand years. When\r\nnations became wicked or extended over a large territory, the patriarchal\r\nrule of the primitive ages no longer proved an efficient government. Men\r\nmust be ruled, however, in some way, and the irresponsible despotism of\r\nthe East, over all the different races, Semitic, Hamite, and Japhetic, was\r\nthe government which Providence provided, in a state of general rudeness,\r\nor pastoral simplicity, or oligarchal usurpations. The last great monarchy\r\nwas the best; it was that which was exercised by the descendants of\r\nJaphet, according to the prediction that he should dwell in the tents of\r\nShem, and Canaan should be his servant.\r\n\r\nBefore we follow the progress of the descendants of Japhet in Greece,\r\namong whom a new civilization arose, designed to improve the condition of\r\nsociety by the free agency displayed in art, science, literature, and\r\ngovernment—the rise, in short, of free institutions—we will glance at the\r\nnations in Asia Minor which were brought in contact with the powers we\r\nhave so briefly considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nASIA MINOR AND PHŒNICIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M201) Concerning the original inhabitants of Asia Minor our information\r\nis very scanty. The works of Strabo shed an indefinite light, and the\r\nauthor of the Iliad seems to have been but imperfectly acquainted with\r\neither the geography or the people of that extensive country. According to\r\nHerodotus, the river Halys was the most important geographical limit; nor\r\ndoes he mention the great chain of Taurus, which begins from the southern\r\ncoast of Lycia, and strikes northeastward as far as Armenia—the most\r\nimportant boundary line in the time of the Romans. Northward of Mount\r\nTaurus, on the upper portion of the river Halys, was situated the spacious\r\nplain of Asia Minor. The northeast and south of this plain was\r\nmountainous, and was bounded by the Euxine, the Ægean, and the Pamphylian\r\nseas. The northwestern part included the mountainous region of Ida,\r\nTemnus, and Olympus. The peninsula was fruitful in grains, wine, fruit,\r\ncattle, and oil.\r\n\r\n(M202) Along the western shores of this great peninsula were Pelasgians,\r\nMysians, Bythinians, Phrygians, Lydians, and other nations, before the\r\nGreeks established their colonies. Further eastward were Lycians,\r\nPisidians, Phrygians, Cappadocians, Paphlagonians, and others. The\r\nPhrygians, Mysians, and Teucrians were on the northwest. These various\r\nnations were not formed into large kingdoms or confederacies, nor even\r\ninto large cities, but were inconsiderable tribes, that presented no\r\nformidable resistance to external enemies. The most powerful people were\r\nthe Lydians, whose capital was Sardis, who were ruled by Gyges, 700 B.C.\r\nThis monarchy extinguished the independence of the Greek cities on the\r\ncoast, without impeding their development in wealth and civilization. All\r\nthe nations west of the river Halys were kindred in language and habits.\r\nEast of the Halys dwelt Semitic races, Assyrians, Syrians, Cappadocians,\r\nand Cilicians. Along the coast of the Euxine dwelt Bythinians,\r\nMarandynians, and Paphlagonians—branches of the Thracian race. Along the\r\nsouthern coast of the Propontis were the Doliones and Pelasgians. In the\r\nregion of Mount Ida were the Teucrians and Mysians. All these races had a\r\ncertain affinity with the Thracians, and all modified the institutions of\r\nthe Greeks who settled on the coast for purposes of traffic or\r\ncolonization. The music of the Greeks was borrowed from the Phrygians and\r\nLydians. The flute is known to have been invented, or used by the\r\nPhrygians, and from them to have passed to Greek composers.\r\n\r\n(M203) The ancient Phrygians were celebrated chiefly for their flocks and\r\nagricultural produce, while the Lydians, dwelling in cities, possessed\r\nmuch gold and and silver. But there are few great historical facts\r\nconnected with either nation. There is an interesting legend connected\r\nwith the Phrygian town of Gordium. The primitive king, Gordius, was\r\noriginally a poor husbandman, upon the yoke of whose team, as he tilled\r\nthe field, an eagle perched. He consulted the augurs to explain the\r\ncurious portent, and was told that the kingdom was destined for his\r\nfamily. His son was Midas, offspring of a maiden of prophetic family. Soon\r\nafter, dissensions breaking out among the Phrygians, they were directed by\r\nan oracle to choose a king, whom they should first see approaching in a\r\nwagon. Gordius and his son Midas were the first they saw approaching the\r\ntown, and the crown was conferred upon them. The wagon was consecrated,\r\nand became celebrated for a knot which no one could untie. Whosoever\r\nshould untie that knot was promised the kingdom of Asia. It remained\r\nuntied until Alexander the Great cut it with his sword.\r\n\r\n(M204) The Lydians became celebrated for their music, of which the chief\r\ninstruments were the flute and the harp. Their capital, Sardis, was\r\nsituated on a precipitous rock, and was deemed impregnable. Among their\r\nkings was Crœsus, whose great wealth was derived from the gold found in\r\nthe sands of the river Pactolus, which flowed toward the Hermus from Mount\r\nTmolus, and also from the industry of his subjects. They were the first on\r\nrecord to coin gold and silver. The antiquity of the Lydian monarchy is\r\nvery great, and was traced to Heracles. The Heracleid dynasty lasted five\r\nhundred and five years, and ended with Myrsus, or Kandaules. His wife was\r\nof exceeding beauty, and the vanity of her husband led him to expose her\r\nperson to Gyges, commander of his guard. The affronted wife, in revenge,\r\ncaused her husband to be assassinated, and married Gyges. A strong party\r\nopposed his ascent to the throne, and a civil war ensued, which was\r\nterminated by a consultation of the oracle, which decided in favor of\r\nGyges, the first historical king of Lydia, about the year 715 B.C.\r\n\r\n(M205) With this king commenced the aggressions from Sardis on the Asiatic\r\nGreeks, which ended in their subjection. How far the Lydian kingdom of\r\nSardis extended during the reign of Gyges is not known, but probably over\r\nthe whole Troad, to Abydus, on the Hellespont. Gyges reigned thirty-eight\r\nyears, and was succeeded by his son Ardys, during whose reign was an\r\nextensive invasion of the Cimmerians, and a collision between the\r\ninhabitants of Lydia and those of Upper Asia, under the Median kings, who\r\nfirst acquired importance about the year 656 B.C. under a king called, by\r\nthe Greeks, Phraortes, son of Deioces, who built the city of Ecbatana.\r\n\r\n(M206) Phraortes greatly extended the empire of the Medes, and conquered\r\nthe Persians, but was defeated and slain by the Assyrians of Nineveh. His\r\nson, Cyaxares (636-595 B.C.) continued the Median conquests to the river\r\nHalys, which was the boundary between the Lydian and Median kingdoms. A\r\nwar between these two powers was terminated by the marriage of the\r\ndaughter of the Lydian king with the son of the Median monarch, Cyaxares,\r\nwho shortly after laid siege to Nineveh, but was obliged to desist by a\r\nsudden inroad of Scythians.\r\n\r\n(M207) This inroad of the Scythians in Media took place about the same\r\ntime that the Cimmerians invaded Lydia, a nomad race which probably\r\ninhabited the Tauric Chersonessus (Crimea), and had once before desolated\r\nAsia Minor before the time of Homer. The Cimmerians may have been urged\r\nforward into Asia Minor by an invasion of the Scythians themselves, a\r\nnomadic people who neither planted nor reaped, but lived on food derived\r\nfrom animals—prototypes of the Huns, and also progenitors—a formidable\r\nrace of barbarians, in the northern section of Central Asia, east of the\r\nCaspian Sea. The Cimmerians fled before this more warlike race, abandoned\r\ntheir country on the northern coast of the Euxine, and invaded Asia Minor.\r\nThey occupied Sardis, and threatened Ephesus, and finally were overwhelmed\r\nin the mountainous regions of Cilicia. Some, however, effected a\r\nsettlement in the territory where the Greek city of Sinope was afterward\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\n(M208) Ardys was succeeded by his son Tadyattes, who reigned twelve years;\r\nand his son and successor, Alyattes, expelled the Cimmerians from Asia\r\nMinor. But the Scythians, who invaded Media, defeated the king, Cyaxares,\r\nand became masters of the country, and spread as far as Palestine, and\r\nenjoyed their dominion twenty-eight years, until they were finally driven\r\naway by Cyaxares. These nomadic tribes from Tartary were the precursors of\r\nHuns, Avars, Bulgarians, Magyars, Turks, Mongols, and Tartars, who, at\r\ndifferent periods, invaded the civilized portions of Asia and Europe, and\r\nestablished a dominion more or less durable.\r\n\r\n(M209) Cyaxares, after the expulsion of the Scythians, took Nineveh, and\r\nreduced the Assyrian empire, while Alyattes, the king of Lydia, after the\r\nCimmerians were subdued, made war on the Greet city of Miletus, and\r\nreduced the Milesians to great distress, and also took Smyrna. He reigned\r\nfifty-seven years with great prosperity, and transmitted his kingdom to\r\nCrœsus, his son by an Ionian wife. His tomb was one of the architectural\r\nwonders of that day, and only surpassed by the edifices of Egypt and\r\nBabylon.\r\n\r\n(M210) Crœsus made war on the Asiatic Greeks, and as the twelve Ionian\r\ncities did not co-operate with any effect, they were subdued. He extended\r\nhis conquests over Asia Minor, until he had conquered the Phrygians,\r\nMysians, and other nations, and created a great empire, of which Sardia\r\nwas the capital. The treasures lie amassed exceeded any thing before known\r\nto the Greeks, though inferior to the treasures accumulated at Susa and\r\nother Persian capitals when Alexander conquered the East.\r\n\r\nBut the Lydian monarchy under Crœsus was soon absorbed in the Persian\r\nempire, together with the cities of the Ionian Greeks, as has been\r\nnarrated.\r\n\r\n(M211) But there was another power intimately connected with the kingdom\r\nof Judea,—the Phœnician, which furnished Solomon artists and timber for\r\nhis famous temple. We close this chapter with a brief notice of the\r\ngreatest merchants of the ancient world, the Phœnicians.\r\n\r\n(M212) They belonged, as well as the Assyrians, to the Semitic or\r\nSyro-Arabian family, comprising, besides, the Syrians, Jews, Arabians, and\r\nin part the Abyssinians. They were at a very early period a trading and\r\nmercantile nation, and the variegated robes and golden ornaments\r\nfabricated at Sidon were prized by the Homeric heroes. They habitually\r\ntraversed the Ægean Sea, and formed settlements on its islands.\r\n\r\n(M213) The Phœnician towns occupied a narrow slip of the coast of Syria\r\nand Palestine, about one hundred and twenty miles in length, and generally\r\nabout twenty in breadth—between Mount Libanus and the sea, Aradus was the\r\nnorthernmost, and Tyre the southernmost city. Between these were situated\r\nSidon, Berytus, Tripolis, and Byblus. Within this confined territory was\r\nconcentrated a greater degree of commercial wealth and enterprise, also of\r\nmanufacturing skill, than could be found in the other parts of the world\r\nat the time. Each town was an independent community, having its own\r\nsurrounding territory, and political constitution and hereditary prince.\r\nTyre was a sort of presiding city, having a controlling political power\r\nover the other cities. Mount Libanus, or Lebanon, touched the sea along\r\nthe Phœnician coast, and furnished abundant supplies for ship-building.\r\n\r\n(M214) The great Phœnician deity was Melkarth, whom the Greeks called\r\nHercules, to whom a splendid temple was erected at Tyre, coeval, perhaps,\r\nwith the foundation of the city two thousand three hundred years before\r\nthe time of Herodotus. In the year 700 B.C., the Phœnicians seemed to have\r\nreached their culminating power, and they had colonies in Africa, Sicily,\r\nSardinia, and Spain. Carthage, Utica, and Gades were all flourishing\r\ncities before the first Olympiad. The commerce of the Phœnicians extended\r\nthrough the Red Sea and the coast of Arabia in the time of Solomon. They\r\nfurnished the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Persians with the varied\r\nproductions of other countries at a very remote period.\r\n\r\n(M215) The most ancient colonies were Utica and Carthage, built in what is\r\nnow called the gulf of Tunis; and Cades, now Cadiz, was prosperous one\r\nthousand years before the Christian era. The enterprising mariners of Tyre\r\ncoasted beyond the pillars of Hercules without ever losing sight of land.\r\nThe extreme productiveness of the southern region of Spain in the precious\r\nmetals tempted the merchants to that distant country. But Carthage was by\r\nfar the most important centre for Tyrian trade, and became the mistress of\r\na large number of dependent cities.\r\n\r\nWhen Psammetichus relaxed the jealous exclusion of ships from the mouth of\r\nthe Nile, the incitements to traffic were greatly increased, and the\r\nPhœnicians, as well as Ionian merchants, visited Egypt. But the Phœnicians\r\nwere jealous of rivals in profitable commerce, and concealed their tracks,\r\nand magnified the dangers of the sea. About the year 600 B.C., they had\r\ncircumnavigated Africa, starting from the Red Sea, and going round the\r\nCape of Good Hope to Gades, and from thence returning by the Nile.\r\n\r\n(M216) It would seem that Nechos, king of Egypt, anxious to procure a\r\nwater communication between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, began\r\ndigging a canal from one to the other. In the prosecution of this project\r\nhe dispatched Phœnicians on an experimental voyage round Libya, which was\r\naccomplished, in three years. The mariners landed in the autumn, and\r\nremained long enough to plant corn and raise a crop for their supplies.\r\nThey reached Egypt through the Straits of Gibraltar, and recounted a tale,\r\nwhich, says Herodotus, “others may believe it if they choose, but I can\r\nnot believe, that in sailing round Libya, they had the sun on their right\r\nand—to the north.” In going round Africa they had no occasion to lose\r\nsight of land, and their vessels were amply stored. The voyage, however,\r\nwas regarded as desperate and unprofitable, and was not repeated.\r\n\r\nBesides the trade which the Phœnicians carried on along the coasts, they\r\nhad an extensive commerce in the interior of Asia. But we do not read of\r\nany great characters who arrested the attention of their own age or\r\nsucceeding ages, Phœnician history is barren in political changes and\r\ngreat historical characters, as is that of Carthage till the Roman wars.\r\n\r\n(M217) Between the years 700 and 530 B.C., there was a great decline of\r\nPhœnician power, which was succeeded by the rise of the Greek maritime\r\ncities. Nebuchadnezzar reduced the Phœnician cities to the same dependence\r\nthat the Ionian cities were reduced by Crœsus and Cyrus. The opening of\r\nthe Nile to the Grecian commerce contributed to the decline of Phœnicia.\r\nBut to this country the Greeks owed the alphabet and the first standard of\r\nweights and measures.\r\n\r\n(M218) Carthage, founded 819 B.C., by Dido, had a flourishing commerce in\r\nthe sixth century before Christ, and also commenced, at this time, their\r\nencroachments in Sicily, which led to wars for two hundred and fifty years\r\nwith the Greek settlements. It contained, it is said, at one time, seven\r\nhundred thousand people. But a further notice of their great city is\r\nreserved until allusion is made to the Punic wars which the Romans waged\r\nwith this powerful State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWISH HISTORY FROM THE BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY TO THE BIRTH OF CHRIST.—THE\r\nHIGH PRIESTS AND THE ASMONEAN AND IDUMEAN KINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M219) We have seen how the ten tribes were carried captive to Assyria, on\r\nthe fall of Samaria, by Shalmanezer, B.C., 721. From that time history\r\nloses sight of the ten tribes, as a distinct people. They were probably\r\nabsorbed with the nations among whom they settled, although imagination\r\nhas loved to follow them into inaccessible regions where they await their\r\nfinal restoration. But there are no reliable facts which justify this\r\nconclusion. They may have been the ancestors of the Christian converts\r\nafterward found among the Nestorians. They may have retained in the East,\r\nto a certain extent, some of their old institutions. But nothing is known\r\nwith certainty. All is vain conjecture respecting their ultimate fortunes.\r\n\r\n(M220) The Jews of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin never entirely\r\ndeparted from their ancient faith, and their monarchs reigned in regular\r\nsuccession till the captivity of the family of David. They were not\r\ncarried to Babylon for one hundred and twenty-three years after the\r\ndispersion of the ten tribes, B.C. 598.\r\n\r\n(M221) During the captivity, the Jews still remained a separate people,\r\ngoverned by their own law and religion. It is supposed that they were\r\nrather colonists than captives, and were allowed to dwell together in\r\nconsiderable bodies—that they were not sold as slaves, and by degrees\r\nbecame possessed of considerable wealth. What region, from time\r\nimmemorial, has not witnessed their thrift and their love of money? Well\r\nmay a Jew say, as well as a Greek, “_Quæ __ regio in terris nostri non\r\nplena laboris._” Taking the advice of Jeremiah they built houses, planted\r\ngardens, and submitted to their fate, even if they bewailed it “by the\r\nrivers of Babylon,” in such sad contrast to their old mountain homes. They\r\nhad the free enjoyment of their religion, and were subjected to no general\r\nand grievous religious persecutions. And some of their noble youth, like\r\nDaniel, were treated with great distinction during the captivity. Daniel\r\nhad been transported to Babylon before Jerusalem fell, as a hostage, among\r\nothers, of the fidelity of their king. These young men, from the highest\r\nJewish families, were educated in all the knowledge of the Babylonians, as\r\nJoseph had been in Egyptian wisdom. They were the equals of the Chaldean\r\npriests in knowledge of astronomy, divination, and the interpretation of\r\ndreams. And though these young hostages were maintained at the public\r\nexpense, and perhaps in the royal palaces, they remembered their\r\ndistressed countrymen, and lived on the simplest fare. It was as an\r\ninterpreter of dreams that Daniel maintained his influence in the\r\nBabylonian court. Twice was he summoned by Nebuchadnezzar, and once by\r\nBelshazzar to interpret the handwriting on the wall. And under the Persian\r\nmonarch, when Babylon fell, Daniel became a vizier, or satrap, with great\r\ndignity and power.\r\n\r\n(M222) When the seventy years’ captivity, which Jeremiah had predicted,\r\ncame to an end, the empire of the Medes and Persians was in the hands of\r\nCyrus, under whose sway he enjoyed the same favor and rank that he did\r\nunder Darius, or any of the Babylonian princes. The miraculous deliverance\r\nof this great man from the lion’s den, into which he had been thrown from\r\nthe intrigues of his enemies and the unalterable law of the Medes,\r\nresulted in a renewed exaltation. Josephus ascribes to Daniel one of the\r\nnoblest and most interesting characters in Jewish history, a great skill\r\nin architecture, and it is to him that the splendid mausoleum at Ecbatana\r\nis attributed. But Daniel, with all his honors, was not corrupted, and it\r\nwas probably through his influence, as a grand vizier, that the exiled\r\nJews obtained from Cyrus the decree which restored them to their beloved\r\nland.\r\n\r\n(M223) The number of the returned Jews, under Zerubbabel, a descendant of\r\nthe kings of Judah, were forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty men—a\r\ngreat and joyful caravan—but small in number compared with the Israelites\r\nwho departed from Egypt with Moses. On their arrival in their native land,\r\nthey were joined by great numbers of the common people who had remained.\r\nThey bore with them the sacred vessels of the temple, which Cyrus\r\ngenerously restored. They arrived in the spring of the year B.C. 536, and\r\nimmediately made preparations for the restoration of the temple; not under\r\nthose circumstances which enabled Solomon to concentrate the wealth of\r\nWestern Asia, but under great discouragements and the pressure of poverty.\r\nThe temple was built on the old foundation, but was not completed till the\r\nsixth year of Darius Hystaspes, B.C. 515, and then without the ancient\r\nsplendor.\r\n\r\n(M224) It was dedicated with great joy and magnificence, but the sacrifice\r\nof one hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and twelve\r\ngoats, formed a sad contrast to the hecatombs which Solomon had offered.\r\n\r\nNothing else of importance marked the history of the dependent,\r\nimpoverished, and humiliated Jews, who had returned to the country of\r\ntheir ancestors during the reign of Darius Hystaspes.\r\n\r\n(M225) It was under his successor, Xerxes, he who commanded the Hellespont\r\nto be scourged—that mad, luxurious, effeminated monarch, who is called in\r\nScripture Ahasuerus,—that Mordecai figured in the court of Persia, and\r\nEsther was exalted to the throne itself. It was in the seventh year of his\r\nreign that this inglorious king returned, discomfited, from the invasion\r\nof Greece. Abandoning himself to the pleasures of his harem, he marries\r\nthe Jewess maiden, who is the instrument, under Providence, of averting\r\nthe greatest calamity with which the Jews were ever threatened. Haman, a\r\ndescendant of the Amalekitish kings, is the favorite minister and grand\r\nvizier of the Persian monarch. Offended with Mordecai, his rival in\r\nimperial favor, the cousin of the queen, he intrigues for the wholesale\r\nslaughter of the Jews wherever they were to be found, promising the king\r\nten thousand talents of silver from the confiscation of Jewish property,\r\nand which the king needed, impoverished by his unsuccessful expedition\r\ninto Greece. He thus obtains a decree from Ahasuerus for the general\r\nmassacre of the Jewish nation, in all the provinces of the empire, of\r\nwhich Judea was one. The Jews are in the utmost consternation, and look to\r\nMordecai. His hope is based on Esther, the queen, who might soften, by her\r\nfascinations, the heart of the king. She assumes the responsibility of\r\nsaving her nation at the peril of her own life—a deed of not extraordinary\r\nself-devotion, but requiring extraordinary tact. What anxiety must have\r\npressed the soul of that Jewish woman in the task she undertook! What a\r\nresponsibility on her unaided shoulders? But she dissembles her grief, her\r\nfear, her anxiety, and appears before the king radiant in beauty and\r\nloveliness. The golden sceptre is extended to her by her weak and cruel\r\nhusband, though arrayed in the pomp and power of an Oriental monarch,\r\nbefore whom all bent the knee, and to whom, even in his folly, he appears\r\nas demigod. She does not venture to tell the king her wishes. The stake is\r\ntoo great. She merely invites him to a grand banquet, with his minister\r\nHaman. Both king and minister are ensnared by the cautious queen, and the\r\nresult is the disgrace of Haman, the elevation of Mordecai, and the\r\ndeliverance of the Jews from the fatal sentence—not a perfect deliverance,\r\nfor the decree could not be changed, but the Jews were warned and allowed\r\nto defend themselves, and they slew seventy-five thousand of their\r\nenemies. The act of vengeance was followed by the execution of the ten\r\nsons of Haman, and Mordecai became the real governor of Persia. We see in\r\nthis story the caprice which governed the actions, in general, of Oriental\r\nkings, and their own slavery to their favorite wives. The charms of a\r\nwoman effect, for evil or good, what conscience, and reason, and policy,\r\nand wisdom united can not do. Esther is justly a favorite with the\r\nChristian and Jewish world; but Vashti, the proud queen who, with true\r\nwoman’s dignity, refuses to grace with her presence the saturnalia of an\r\nintoxicated monarch, is also entitled to our esteem, although she paid the\r\npenalty of disobedience; and the foolish edict which the king promulgated,\r\nthat all women should implicitly obey their husbands, seems to indicate\r\nthat unconditional obedience was not the custom of the Persian women.\r\n\r\n(M226) The reign of Artaxerxes, the successor of Xerxes, was favorable to\r\nthe Jews, for Judea was a province of the Persian empire. In the seventh\r\nyear of his reign, B.C. 458, a new migration of Jews from Babylonia took\r\nplace, headed by Ezra, a man of high rank at the Persian court. He was\r\nempowered to make a collection among the Jews of Babylonia for the\r\nadornment of the temple, and he came to Jerusalem laden with treasures. He\r\nwas, however, affected by the sight of a custom which had grown up, of\r\nintermarriage of the Jews with adjacent tribes. He succeeded in causing\r\nthe foreign wives to be repudiated, and the old laws to be enforced which\r\nseparated the Jews from all other nations. And it is probably this stern\r\nlaw, which prevents the Jews from marriage with foreigners, that has\r\npreserved their nationality, in all their wanderings and misfortunes, more\r\nthan any other one cause.\r\n\r\n(M227) A renewed commission granted to Nehemiah, B.C. 445, resulted in a\r\nfresh immigration of Jews to Palestine, in spite of all the opposition\r\nwhich the Samaritan and other nations made. Nehemiah was cup-bearer to the\r\nPersian king, and devoted to the Persian interests. At that time Persia\r\nhad suffered a fatal blow at the battle of Cindus, and among the\r\nhumiliating articles of peace with the Athenian admiral was the\r\nstipulation that the Persians should not advance within three days’\r\njourney of the sea. Jerusalem being at this distance, was an important\r\npost to hold, and the Persian court saw the wisdom of intrusting its\r\ndefense to faithful allies. In spite of all obstacles, Nehemiah succeeded,\r\nin fifty-two days, in restoring the old walls and fortifications; the\r\nwhole population, of every rank and order having devoted themselves to the\r\nwork. Moreover, contributions for the temple continued to flow into the\r\ntreasury of a once opulent, but now impoverished and decimated people.\r\nAfter providing for the security of the capital and the adornment of the\r\ntemple, the leaders of the nation turned their attention to the\r\ncompilation of the sacred books and the restoration of religion. Many\r\nimportant literary works had been lost during their captivity, including\r\nthe work of Solomon on national history, and the ancient book of Jasher.\r\nBut the books on the law, the historical books, the prophetic writings,\r\nthe Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Songs of Solomon, were\r\ncollected and copied. The law, revised and corrected, was publicly read by\r\nEzra; the Feast of Tabernacles was celebrated with considerable splendor;\r\nand a renewed covenant was made by the people to keep the law, to observe\r\nthe Sabbath, to avoid idolatry, and abstain from intermarriage with\r\nstrangers. The Jewish constitution was restored, and Nehemiah, a Persian\r\nsatrap in reality, lived in a state of considerable magnificence,\r\nentertaining the chief leaders of the nation, and reforming all disorders.\r\nJerusalem gradually regained political importance, while the country of\r\nthe ten tribes, though filled with people, continued to be the seat of\r\nidolaters.\r\n\r\n(M228) On the death of Nehemiah, B.C. 415, the history of the Jews becomes\r\nobscure, and we catch only scattered glimpses of the state of the country,\r\ntill the accession of Antiochus Epiphanes, B.C. 175, when the Syrian\r\nmonarch had erected a new kingdom on the ruins of the Persian empire. For\r\nmore than two centuries, when the Greeks and Romans flourished, Jewish\r\nhistory is a blank, with here and there some scattered notices and\r\ntraditions which Josephus has recorded. The Jews, living in vassalage to\r\nthe successors of Alexander during this interval, had become animated by a\r\nmartial spirit, and the Maccabaic wars elevated them into sufficient\r\nimportance to become allies of Rome—the new conquering power, destined to\r\nsubdue the world. During this period the Jewish character assumed the\r\nhard, stubborn, exclusive cast which it has ever since maintained—an\r\nintense hostility to polytheism and all Gentile influences. The Jewish\r\nScriptures took their present shape, and the Apocryphal books came to\r\nlight. The sects of the Jews arose, like Pharisees and Sadducees, and\r\nreligious and political parties exhibited an unwonted fierceness and\r\nintolerance. While the Greeks and Romans were absorbed in wars, the Jews\r\nperfected their peculiar economy, and grew again into political\r\nimportance. The country, by means of irrigation and cultivation, became\r\npopulous and fertile, and poetry and the arts regained their sway. The\r\npeople took but little interest in the political convulsions of\r\nneighboring nations, and devoted themselves quietly to the development of\r\ntheir own resources. The captivity had cured them of war, of idolatry, and\r\nwarlike expeditions.\r\n\r\n(M229) During this two hundred years of obscurity, but real growth,\r\nunnoticed and unknown by other nations, a new capital had arisen in Egypt;\r\nAlexandria became a great mart of commerce, and the seat of revived\r\nGrecian learning. The sway of the Ptolemaic kings, Grecian in origin, was\r\nfavorable to letters, and to arts. The Jews settled in their magnificent\r\ncity, translated their Scriptures into Greek, and cultivated the Greek\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n(M230) Meanwhile the internal government of the Jews fell into the hands\r\nof the high priests—the Persian governors exercising only a general\r\nsuperintendence. At length the country, once again favored, was subjected\r\nto the invasion of Alexander. After the fall of Tyre, the conqueror\r\nadvanced to Gaza, and totally destroyed it. He then approached Jerusalem,\r\nin fealty to Persia. The high priest made no resistance, but went forth in\r\nhis pontifical robes, followed by the people in white garments, to meet\r\nthe mighty warrior. Alexander, probably encouraged by the prophesies of\r\nDaniel, as explained by the high priest, did no harm to the city or\r\nnation, but offered gifts, and, as tradition asserts, even worshiped the\r\nGod of the Jews. On the conquest of Persia, Judea came into the possession\r\nof Laomedon, one of the generals of Alexander, B.C. 321. On his defeat by\r\nPtolemy, another general, to whom Egypt had fallen as his share, one\r\nhundred thousand Jews were carried captive to Alexandria, where they\r\nsettled and learned the Greek language. The country continued to be\r\nconvulsed by the wars between the generals of Alexander, and fell into the\r\nhands, alternately, of the Syrian and Egyptian kings—successors of the\r\ngenerals of the great conqueror.\r\n\r\n(M231) On the establishment of the Syro-Grecian kingdom by Seleucus,\r\nAntioch, the capital, became a great city, and the rival of Alexandria.\r\nSyria, no longer a satrapy of Persia, became a powerful monarchy, and\r\nJudea became a prey to the armies of this ambitious State in its warfare\r\nwith Egypt, and was alternately the vassal of each—Syria and Egypt. Under\r\nthe government of the first three Ptolemies—those enlightened and\r\nmagnificent princes, Soter, Philadelphus, and Evergetes, the Jews were\r\nprotected, both at home and in Alexandria, and their country enjoyed peace\r\nand prosperity, until the ambition of Antiochus the Great again plunged\r\nthe nation in difficulties. He had seized Judea, which was then a province\r\nof the Egyptian kings, but was defeated by Ptolemy Philopator. This\r\nmonarch made sumptuous presents to the temple, and even ventured to enter\r\nthe sanctuary, but was prevented by the high priest. Although filled with\r\nfear in view of the tumult which this act provoked, he henceforth hated\r\nand persecuted the Jews. Under his successor, Judea was again invaded by\r\nAntiochus, and again was Jerusalem wrested from his grasp by Scopas, the\r\nEgyptian general. Defeated, however, near the source of the Jordan, the\r\ncountry fell into the hands of Antiochus, who was regarded as a deliverer.\r\nAnd it continued to be subject to the kings of Syria, until, with\r\nJerusalem, it suffered calamities scarcely inferior to those inflicted by\r\nthe Babylonians.\r\n\r\n(M232) It is difficult to trace, with any satisfaction, the internal\r\ngovernment of the Jews during the two hundred years when the chief power\r\nwas in the hands of the high priests—this period marked by the wars\r\nbetween Syria and Egypt, or rather between the successors of the generals\r\nof Alexander. The government of the high priests at Jerusalem was not\r\nexempt from those disgraceful outrages which occasionally have marked all\r\nthe governments of the world—whether in the hands of kings, or in an\r\noligarchy of nobles and priests. Nehemiah had expelled from Jerusalem,\r\nManasseh, the son of Jehoiada, who succeeded Eliashib in the high\r\npriesthood, on account of his unlawful marriage with a stranger. Manasseh,\r\ninvited to Samaria by the father of the woman he had married, became high\r\npriest of the temple on Mount Gerizim, and thus perpetuated the schism\r\nbetween the two nations. Before the conquests of Alexander, while the\r\ncountry was under the dominion of Persia, a high priest by the name of\r\nJohn murdered his brother Jesus within the precincts of the sanctuary,\r\nwhich crime was punished by the Persian governor, by a heavy fine imposed\r\nupon the whole nation. Jaddua was the high priest in the time of\r\nAlexander, and by his dignity and tact won over the conqueror of Asia.\r\nOnias succeeded Jaddua, and ruled for twenty-one years, and he was\r\nsucceeded by Simon the Just, a pontiff on whose administration Jewish\r\ntradition dwells with delight. Simon was succeeded by his uncles, Eleazar\r\nand Manasseh, and they by Onias II., son of Simon, through whose\r\nmisconduct, or indolence, in omitting the customary tribute to the\r\nEgyptian king, came near involving the country in fresh\r\ncalamities—averted, however, by his nephew Joseph, who pacified the\r\nEgyptian court, and obtained the former generalship of the revenues of\r\nJudea, Samaria, and Phœnicia, which he enjoyed to the time of Antiochus\r\nthe Great. Onias II. was succeeded by his son Simon, under whose\r\npontificate the Egyptian monarch was prevented from entering the temple,\r\nand he by Onias III., under whose rule a feud took place with the sons of\r\nJoseph, disgraced by murders, which called for the interposition of the\r\nSyrian king, who then possessed Judea. Joshua, or Jason, by bribery,\r\nobtained the pontificate, but he allowed the temple worship to fall into\r\ndisuse, and was even alienated from the Jewish faith by his intimacy with\r\nthe Syrian court. He was outbidden in his high office by Onias, his\r\nbrother, who was disgraced by savage passions, and who robbed the temple\r\nof its golden vessels. The people, indignant, rose in a tumult, and slew\r\nhis brother, Lysimachus. Meanwhile, Jason, the dispossessed high priest,\r\nrecovered his authority, and shut up Onias, or Menelaus, as he called\r\nhimself, in a castle. This was interpreted by Antiochus as an\r\ninsurrection, and he visited on Jerusalem a terrible penalty—slaughtering\r\nforty thousand of the people, and seizing as many more for slaves. He then\r\nabolished the temple services, seized all the sacred vessels, collected\r\nspoil to the amount of eighteen hundred talents, defiled the altar by the\r\nsacrifice of a sow, and suppressed every sign of Jewish independence. He\r\nmeditated the complete extirpation of the Jewish religion, dismantled the\r\ncapitol, harassed the country people, and inflicted unprecedented\r\nbarbarities. The temple itself was dedicated to Jupiter Olympius, and the\r\nreluctant and miserable Jews were forced to join in all the rites of pagan\r\nworship, including the bacchanalia, which mocked the virtue of the older\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\n(M233) From this degradation and slavery the Jews were rescued by a line\r\nof heroes whom God raised up—the Asmoneans, or Maccabees. The head of this\r\nheroic family was Mattathias, a man of priestly origin, living in the town\r\nof Modin, commanding a view of the sea—an old man of wealth and influence\r\nwho refused to depart from the faith of his fathers, while most of the\r\nnation had relapsed into the paganism of the Greeks. He slew with his own\r\nhand an apostate Jew, who offered sacrifice to a pagan deity, and then\r\nkilled the royal commissioner, Apelles, whom Antiochus had sent to enforce\r\nhis edicts. The heroic old man, who resembled William Tell, in his mission\r\nand character, summoned his countrymen, who adhered to the old faith, and\r\nintrenched himself in the mountains, and headed a vigorous revolt against\r\nthe Syrian power, even fighting on the Sabbath day. The ranks of the\r\ninsurrectionists were gradually filled with those who were still zealous\r\nfor the law, or inspired with patriotic desires for independence.\r\nMattathias was prospered, making successful raids from his mountain\r\nfastnesses, destroying heathen altars, and punishing apostate Jews. Two\r\nsects joined his standard with peculiar ardor—the Zadikim, who observed\r\nthe written law of Moses, from whom the Sadducees of later times sprang,\r\nand the more zealous and austere Chasidim, who added to the law the\r\ntraditions of the elders, from whom the Pharisees came.\r\n\r\nOld men are ill suited to conduct military expeditions when great fatigue\r\nand privation are required, and the aged Mattathias sank under the weight\r\nwhich he had so nobly supported, and bequeathed his power to Judas, the\r\nmost valiant of his sons.\r\n\r\n(M234) This remarkable man, scarcely inferior to Joshua and David in\r\nmilitary genius and heroic qualities, added prudence and discretion to\r\npersonal bravery. When his followers had gained experience and courage by\r\nvarious gallant adventures, he led them openly against his enemies. The\r\ngovernor of Samaria, Apollonius, was the first whom he encountered, and\r\nwhom he routed and slew. Seron, the deputy governor of Cœlesyria, sought\r\nto redeem the disgrace of the Syrian arms; but he also was defeated at the\r\npass of Bethoron. At the urgent solicitation of Philip, governor of\r\nJerusalem, Antiochus then sent a strong force of forty thousand foot and\r\nseven thousand horse to subdue the insurgents, under the command of\r\nPtolemy Macron. Judas, to resist these forces, had six thousand men; but\r\nhe relied on the God of Israel, as his fathers had done in the early ages\r\nof Jewish history, and in a sudden attack he totally routed a large\r\ndetachment of the main army, under Gorgias, and spoiled their camp. He\r\nthen defeated another force beyond the Jordan, and the general fled in the\r\ndisguise of a slave, to Antioch. Thus closed a triumphant campaign.\r\n\r\n(M235) The next year, Lysias, the lieutenant-general of Antiochus, invaded\r\nJudea with a large force of sixty-five thousand men. Judas met it with ten\r\nthousand, and gained a brilliant victory, which proved decisive, and which\r\nled to the re-establishment of the Jewish power at Jerusalem. Judas\r\nfortified the city and the temple, and assumed the offensive, and\r\nrecovered, one after another, the cities which had fallen under the\r\ndominion of Syria. In the mean time, Antiochus, the bitterest enemy which\r\nthe Jews ever had, died miserably in Persia—the most powerful of all the\r\nSyrian kings.\r\n\r\n(M236) On the accession of Antiochus Eupater, Lysias again attempted the\r\nsubjugation of Judea, This time he advanced with one hundred thousand\r\nfoot, twenty thousand horse, and thirty-two elephants. But this large\r\nforce wasted away in an unsuccessful attack on Jerusalem, harassed by the\r\nsoldiers of the Maccabees. A treaty of peace was concluded, by which full\r\nliberty of worship was granted to the Jews, with permission to be ruled by\r\ntheir own laws.\r\n\r\n(M237) Demetrius, the lawful heir of Antiochus the Great, had been\r\ndetained at Rome as a hostage, in consequence of which Antiochus Eupater\r\nhad usurped his throne. Escaping from Rome, he overpowered his enemies and\r\nrecovered his kingdom. But he was even more hostile to the Jews than his\r\npredecessor, and succeeded in imposing a high priest on the nation\r\nfriendly to his interests. His cruelties and crimes once more aroused the\r\nJews to resistance, and Judas gained another decisive victory, and\r\nNicanor, the Syrian general, was slain.\r\n\r\n(M238) Judas then adopted a policy which was pregnant with important\r\nconsequences. He formed a league with the Romans, then bent on the\r\nconquest of the East. The Roman senate readily entered into a coalition\r\nwith the weaker State, in accordance with its uniform custom of protecting\r\nthose whom they ultimately absorbed in their vast empire: but scarcely was\r\nthe treaty ratified when the gallant Judas died, leaving the defense of\r\nhis country to his brothers, B.C. 161.\r\n\r\n(M239) Jonathan, on whom the leadership fell, found the forces under his\r\ncontrol disheartened by the tyranny of the high priest, Alcimus, whom the\r\nnation had accepted. Leagued with Bacchides, the Syrian general, the high\r\npriest had every thing his own way, until Jonathan, emerging from his\r\nretreat, delivered his countrymen once again, and another peace was made.\r\nSeveral years then passed in tranquillity, Jonathan being master of Judea.\r\nA revolution in Syria added to his power, and his brother Simon was made\r\ncaptain-general of all the country from Tyre to Egypt. Jonathan,\r\nunfortunately, was taken in siege, and the leadership of the nation\r\ndevolved upon Simon, the last of this heroic family. He ruled with great\r\nwisdom, consolidated his power, strengthened his alliance with Rome,\r\nrepaired Jerusalem, and restored the peace of the country. He was, on a\r\npresent of one thousand pounds of gold to the Romans, decreed to be prince\r\nof Judea, and taken under the protection of his powerful ally. But the\r\npeace with Syria, from the new complications to which that kingdom was\r\nsubjected from rival aspirants to the throne, was broken in the old age of\r\nSimon, and he was treacherously murdered, with his oldest son, Judas, at a\r\nbanquet in Jerusalem. The youngest son, John Hyrcanus, inherited the vigor\r\nof his family, and was declared high priest, and sought to revenge the\r\nmurder of his father and brother. Still, a Syrian army overran the\r\ncountry, and John Hyrcanus, shut up in Jerusalem, was reduced to great\r\nextremities. A peace was finally made between him and the Syrian monarch,\r\nAntiochus, by which Judea submitted to vassalage to the king of Syria. An\r\nunfortunate expedition of Antiochus into Parthia enabled Hyrcanus once\r\nagain to throw off the Syrian yoke, and Judea regained its independence,\r\nwhich it maintained until compelled to acknowledge the Roman power.\r\nHyrcanus was prospered in his reign, and destroyed the rival temple on\r\nMount Gerizim, while the temple of Jerusalem resumed its ancient dignity\r\nand splendor.\r\n\r\n(M240) At this period the Jews, who had settled in Alexandria, devoted\r\nthemselves to literature and philosophy in that liberal and elegant city,\r\nand were allowed liberty of worship. But they became entangled in the\r\nmazes of Grecian speculation, and lost much of their ancient spirit. By\r\ncompliance with the opinions and customs of the Greeks, they reached great\r\nhonors and distinction, and even high posts in the army.\r\n\r\n(M241) Hyrcanus, supreme in Judea, now reduced Samaria and Idumea, and was\r\nonly troubled by the conflicting parties of Pharisees and Sadducees, whose\r\nquarrels agitated the State. He joined the party of the Sadducees, who\r\nasserted free will, and denied the more orthodox doctrines of the\r\nPharisees, a kind of epicureans, opposed to severities and the authority\r\nof traditions. It is one proof of the advance of the Hebrew mind over the\r\nsimplicity of former ages, that the State could be agitated by theological\r\nand philosophical questions, like the States of Greece in their highest\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n(M242) Hyrcanus reigned twenty-nine years, and was succeeded by his son,\r\nAristobulus, B.C. 106. His brief and inglorious reign was disgraced by his\r\nstarving to death his mother in a dungeon, and imprisoning his three\r\nbrothers, and assassinating a fourth, Antigonus, who was a victorious\r\ngeneral. This prince died in an agony of remorse and horror on the spot\r\nwhere his brother was assassinated.\r\n\r\nAlexander Jannaus succeeded to the throne of the Asmonean princes, who\r\npossessed the whole region of Palestine, except the port of Ptolemais, and\r\nthe city of Gaza. In an attempt to recover the former he was signally\r\ndefeated, and came near losing his throne. He was more successful in his\r\nattack on Gaza, which finally surrendered, after Alexander had incurred\r\nimmense losses.\r\n\r\n(M243) While this priest-king was celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles, a\r\nmeeting, incited by the Pharisaic party, broke out, which resulted in the\r\nslaughter of ten thousand people. While invading the country to the east\r\nof the Jordan, the rebellion was renewed, and the nation, for six years,\r\nsuffered all the evils of civil war. Routed in a battle with the Syrian\r\nmonarch, whose aid the insurgents had invoked, he was obliged to flee to\r\nthe mountains; but recovering his authority, at the head of sixty thousand\r\nmen,—which shows the power of Judea at this period,—he marched upon\r\nJerusalem, and inflicted a terrible vengeance, eight hundred men being\r\npublicly crucified, and eight thousand more forced to abandon the city.\r\nUnder his iron sway, the country recovered its political importance, for\r\nhis kingdom comprised the greater part of Palestine. He died, after a\r\nturbulent reign of twenty-seven years, B.C. 77, invoking his queen to\r\nthrow herself into the arms of the Pharisaic party, which advice she\r\nfollowed, as it was the most powerful and popular.\r\n\r\n(M244) The high priesthood devolved on his eldest son, Hyrcanus II., while\r\nthe reins of government were held by his queen, Alexandra. She reigned\r\nvigorously and prosperously for nine years, punishing the murderers of the\r\neight hundred Pharisees who had been executed.\r\n\r\nHyrcanus was not equal to his task amid the bitterness of party strife.\r\nHis brother Aristobulus, belonging to the party of the Sadducees, and who\r\nhad taken Damascus, was popular with the people, and compelled his elder\r\nbrother to abdicate in his favor, and an end came to Pharisaic rule.\r\n\r\n(M245) But now another family appears upon the stage, which ultimately\r\nwrested the crown from the Asmodean princes. Antipater, a noble Idumean,\r\nwas the chief minister of the feeble Hyrcanus. He incited, from motives of\r\nambition, the deposed prince to reassert his rights, and influenced by his\r\ncounsels, he fled to Aretas, the king of Arabia, whose capital, Petra, had\r\nbecome a great commercial emporium. Aretas, Antipater, and Hyrcanus,\r\nmarched with an army of fifty thousand men against Aristobulus, who was\r\ndefeated, and fled to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n(M246) At this time Pompey was pursuing his career of conquests in the\r\nEast, and both parties invoked his interference, and both offered enormous\r\nbribes. This powerful Roman was then at Damascus, receiving the homage and\r\ntribute of Oriental kings. The Egyptian monarch sent as a present a crown\r\nworth four thousand pieces of gold. Aristobulus, in command of the riches\r\nof the temple, sent a golden vine worth five hundred talents. Pompey,\r\nintent on the conquest of Arabia, made no decision; but, having succeeded\r\nin his object, assumed a tone of haughtiness irreconcilable with the\r\nindependence of Judea. Aristobulus, patriotic yet vacillating,—“too\r\nhigh-minded to yield, too weak to resist,”—fled to Jerusalem and prepared\r\nfor resistance.\r\n\r\n(M247) Pompey approached the capital, weakened by those everlasting\r\ndivisions to which the latter Jews were subjected by the zeal of their\r\nreligious disputes. The city fell, after a brave defense of three months,\r\nand might not have fallen had the Jews been willing to abate from the\r\nrigid observance of the Sabbath, during which the Romans prepared for\r\nassault. Pompey demolished the fortifications of the city, and exacted\r\ntribute, but spared the treasures of the temple which he profaned by his\r\nheathen presence. He nominated Hyrcanus to the priesthood, but withheld\r\nthe royal diadem, and limited the dominions of Hyrcanus to Judea. He took\r\nAristobulus to Rome to grace his triumph.\r\n\r\n(M248) But he contrived to escape, and, with his son Alexander, again\r\nrenewed the civil strife; but taken prisoner, he was again sent as a\r\ncaptive to the “eternal city.” Gabinius, the Roman general—for Hyrcanus\r\nhad invoked the aid of the Romans—now deprived the high priest of the\r\nroyal authority, and reorganized the whole government of Judea;\r\nestablishing five independent Sanhedrims in the principal cities, after\r\nthe form of the great Sanhedrim, which had existed since the captivity.\r\nThis form lasted until Julius Cæsar reinvested Hyrcanus with the supreme\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n(M249) Jerusalem was now exposed to the rapacity of the Roman generals who\r\nreally governed the country. Crassus plundered all that Pompey spared. He\r\ntook from the temple ten thousand talents—about ten million dollars when\r\ngold and silver had vastly greater value than in our times. These vast\r\nsums had been accumulated from the contributions of Jews scattered over\r\nthe world—some of whom were immensely wealthy.\r\n\r\n(M250) Aristobulus and his son Alexander were assassinated during the\r\ngreat civil war between the partisans of Cæsar and Pompey. After the fall\r\nof the latter. Cæsar confirmed Hyrcanus in the high priesthood, and\r\nallowed him to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. But Antipater, presuming on\r\nthe incapacity of Hyrcanus, renewed his ambitious intrigues, and contrived\r\nto make his son, Phasael, governor of Jerusalem, and Herod, a second son,\r\ngovernor of Galilee.\r\n\r\n(M251) Herod developed great talents, and waited for his time. After the\r\nbattle of Philippi Herod made acceptable offerings to the conquering\r\nparty, and received the crown of Judea, which had been recently ravaged by\r\nthe Parthians, through the intrigues of Antigonas, the surviving son of\r\nAristobulus. By his marriage with Mariamne, of the royal line of the\r\nAsmoneans, he cemented the power he had won by the sword and the favor of\r\nRome. He was the last of the independent sovereigns of Palestine. He\r\nreigned tyrannically, and was guilty of great crimes, having caused the\r\ndeath of the aged Hyrcanus, and the imprisonment and execution of his wife\r\non a foul suspicion. He paid the same court to Augustus that he did to\r\nAntony, and was confirmed in the possession of his kingdom. The last of\r\nthe line of the Asmonæans had perished on the scaffold, beautiful,\r\ninnocent, and proud, the object of a boundless passion to a tyrant who\r\nsacrificed her to a still greater one—suspicion. Alternating between his\r\nlove and resentment, Herod sank into a violent fit of remorse, for he had\r\nmore or less concern in the murder of the father, the grandfather, the\r\nbrother, and the uncle of his beautiful and imperious wife. At all times,\r\neven amid the glories of his palace, he was haunted with the image of the\r\nwife he had destroyed, and loved with passionate ardor. He burst forth in\r\ntears, he tried every diversion, banquets and revels, solitude and\r\nlabor—still the murdered Mariamne is ever present to his excited\r\nimagination. He settles down in a fixed and indelible gloom, and his stern\r\nnature sought cruelty and bloodshed. His public administration was, on the\r\nwhole, favorable to the peace and happiness of the country, although he\r\nintroduced the games and the theatres in which the Romans sought their\r\ngreatest pleasures. For these innovations he was exposed to incessant\r\ndangers; but he surmounted them all by his vigilance and energy. He\r\nrebuilt Samaria, and erected palaces. But his greatest work was the\r\nbuilding of Cæsarea—a city of palaces and theatres. His policy of reducing\r\nJudea to a mere province of Rome was not pleasing to his subjects, and he\r\nwas suspected of a design of heathenizing the nation. Neither his\r\nmunificence nor severities could suppress the murmurs of an indignant\r\npeople. The undisguised hostility of the nation prompted him to an act of\r\npolicy by which he hoped to conciliate it forever. The pride and glory of\r\nthe Jews was their temple. This Herod determined to rebuild with\r\nextraordinary splendor, so as to approach its magnificence in the time of\r\nSolomon. He removed the old structure, dilapidated by the sieges, and\r\nviolence, and wear of five hundred years; and the new edifice gradually\r\narose, glittering with gold, and imposing with marble pinnacles.\r\n\r\n(M252) But in spite of all his magnificent public works, whether to\r\ngratify the pride of his people, or his own vanity—in spite of his efforts\r\nto develop the resources of the country over which he ruled by the favor\r\nof Rome—in spite of his talents and energies—one of the most able of the\r\nmonarchs who had sat on the throne of Judea, he was obnoxious to his\r\nsubjects for his cruelties, and his sympathy with paganism, and he was\r\nvisited in his latter days by a terrible disorder which racked his body\r\nwith pain, and inflamed his soul with suspicions, while his court was\r\ndistracted with cabals from his own family, which poisoned his life, and\r\nled him to perpetrate unnatural cruelties. He had already executed two\r\nfavorite sons, by Mariamne whom he loved, all from court intrigues and\r\njealousy, and he then executed his son and heir, by Doris, his first wife,\r\nwhom he had divorced to marry Mariamne, and under circumstances so cruel\r\nthat Augustus remarked that he had rather be one of his swine than one of\r\nhis sons. Among other atrocities, he had ordered the massacre of the\r\nInnocents to prevent any one to be born “as king of the Jews.” His last\r\nact was to give the fatal mandate for the execution of his son Antipater,\r\nwhom he hoped to make his heir, and then almost immediately expired in\r\nagonies, detested by the nation, and leaving a name as infamous as that of\r\nAhab, B.C. 4.\r\n\r\n(M253) Herod had married ten wives, and left a numerous family. By his\r\nwill, he designated the sons of Malthace, his sixth wife, and a Samaritan,\r\nas his successors. These were Archelaus, Antipas, and Olympias. The first\r\ninherited Idumea, Samaria, and Judea; to the second were assigned Galilee\r\nand Peræa. Archelaus at once assumed the government at Jerusalem; and\r\nafter he had given his father a magnificent funeral, and the people a\r\nfuneral banquet, he entered the temple, seated himself on a golden throne,\r\nand made, as is usual with monarchs, a conciliatory speech, promising\r\nreform and alleviations from taxes and oppression. But even this did not\r\nprevent one of those disgraceful seditions which have ever marked the\r\npeople of Jerusalem, in which three thousand were slain, caused by\r\nreligious animosities. After quelling the tumult by the military, he set\r\nout for Rome, to secure his confirmation to the throne. He encountered\r\nopposition from various intrigues by his own family, and the caprice of\r\nthe emperor. His younger brother, Antipas, also went to Rome to support\r\nhis claim to the throne by virtue of a former will. While the cause of the\r\nroyal litigants was being settled in the supreme tribunal of the civilized\r\nworld, new disturbances broke out in Judea, caused by the rapacities of\r\nSabinus, the Roman procurator of Syria. The whole country was in a state\r\nof anarchy, and adventurers flocked from all quarters to assert their\r\nclaims in a nation that ardently looked forward to national independence,\r\nor the rise of some conqueror who should restore the predicted glory of\r\nthe land now rent with civil feuds, and stained with fratricidal blood.\r\nVarus, the prefect of Syria, attempted to restore order, and crucified\r\nsome two thousand ringleaders of the tumults. Five hundred Jews went to\r\nRome to petition for the restoration of their ancient constitution, and\r\nthe abolition of kingly rule.\r\n\r\n(M254) At length the imperial edict confirmed the will of Herod, and\r\nArchelaus was appointed to the sovereignty of Jerusalem, Idumea, and\r\nSamaria, under the title of ethnarch; Herod Antipas obtained Galilee and\r\nPeræa; Philip, the son of Herod and Cleopatra of Jerusalem, was made\r\ntetrarch of Ituræa. Archelaus governed his dominions with such injustice\r\nand cruelty, that he was deposed by the emperor, and Judea became a Roman\r\nprovince. The sceptre departed finally from the family of David, of the\r\nAsmonæans, and of Herod, and the kingdom sank into a district dependent on\r\nthe prefecture of Syria, though administered by a Roman governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN GOVERNORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M255) The history of the Jews after the death of Herod is marked by the\r\ngreatest event in human annals. In four years after he expired in agonies\r\nof pain and remorse, Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem, whose teachings\r\nhave changed the whole condition of the world, and will continue to change\r\nall institutions and governments until the seed of the woman shall have\r\ncompletely triumphed over all the wiles of the serpent. We can not,\r\nhowever, enter upon the life or mission of the Saviour, or the feeble\r\nbeginnings of the early and persecuted Church which he founded, and which\r\nis destined to go on from conquering to conquer. We return to the more\r\ndirect history of the Jewish nation until their capital fell into the\r\nhands of Titus, and their political existence was annihilated.\r\n\r\n(M256) They were now to be ruled by Roman governors—or by mere vassal\r\nkings whom the Romans tolerated and protected. The first of these rulers\r\nwas P. Sulpicius Quirinus—a man of consular rank, who, as proconsul of\r\nSyria, was responsible for the government of Judea, which was intrusted to\r\nCoponius. He was succeeded by M. Ambivius, and he again by Annius Rufus. A\r\nrapid succession of governors took place till Tiberius appointed Valerius\r\nGratus, who was kept in power eleven years, on the principle that a rapid\r\nsuccession of rulers increased the oppression of the people, since every\r\nnew governor sought to be enriched. Tiberius was a tyrant, but a wise\r\nemperor, and the affairs of the Roman world were never better administered\r\nthan during his reign. These provincial governors, like the Herodian\r\nkings, appointed and removed the high priests, and left the internal\r\nmanagement of the city of Jerusalem to them. They generally resided\r\nthemselves at Cæsarea, to avoid the disputes of the Jewish sects, and the\r\ntumults of the people.\r\n\r\n(M257) Pontius Pilate succeeded Gratus A.D. 27,—under whose memorable rule\r\nJesus Christ was crucified and slain—a man cruel, stern, and reckless of\r\nhuman life, but regardful of the peace and tranquillity of the province.\r\nHe sought to transfer the innocent criminal to the tribunal of Herod, to\r\nwhose jurisdiction he belonged as a Galilean, but yielded to the\r\nimportunities of the people, and left him at the mercy of the Jewish\r\npriesthood.\r\n\r\nThe vigilant jealousy of popular commotion, and the reckless disregard of\r\nhuman life, led to the recall of Pilate; but during the forty years which\r\nhad elapsed since the death of Herod, his sons had quietly reigned over\r\ntheir respective provinces. Antipas at Sepphoris, the capital of Galilee,\r\nand Philip beyond the Jordan. The latter prince was humane and just, and\r\ndied without issue, and his territory was annexed to Syria.\r\n\r\n(M258) Herod Antipas was a different man. He seduced and married his niece\r\nHerodias, wife of Herod Philip, daughter of Aristobolus, and granddaughter\r\nof Mariamne, whom Herod the Great had sacrificed in jealousy—the last\r\nscion of the Asmonæan princes. It was for her that John the Baptist was\r\nput to death. But this marriage proved unfortunate, since it involved him\r\nin difficulties with Aretas, king of Arabia, father of his first and\r\nrepudiated wife. He ended his days in exile at Lyons, having provoked the\r\njealousy or enmity of Caligula, the Roman emperor, through the intrigues\r\nof Herod Agrippa, the brother of Herodias, and consequently, a grandson of\r\nHerod the Great and Mariamne. The Herodian family, of Idumean origin,\r\nnever was free from disgraceful quarrels and jealousies and rivalries.\r\n\r\n(M259) The dominions of Herod Antipas were transferred to Herod Agrippa,\r\nwho had already obtained from Caligula the tetrarchate of Ituræa, on the\r\ndeath of Philip, with the title of king. The fortunes of this prince, in\r\nwhose veins flowed the blood of the Asmonæans and the Herodians, surpassed\r\nin romance and vicissitude any recorded of Eastern princes; alternately a\r\nfugitive and a favorite, a vagabond and a courtier, a pauper and a\r\nspendthrift—according to the varied hatred and favor of the imperial\r\nfamily at Rome. He had the good luck to be a friend of Caligula before the\r\ndeath of Tiberius. When he ascended the throne of the Roman world, he took\r\nhis friend from prison and disgrace, and gave him a royal title and part\r\nof the dominions of his ancestors.\r\n\r\n(M260) Agrippa did all he could to avert the mad designs of Caligula of\r\nsecuring religious worship as a deity from the Jews, and he was moderate\r\nin his government and policy. On the death of the Roman tyrant, he\r\nreceived from his successor Claudius the investiture of all the dominions\r\nwhich belonged to Herod the Great. He reigned in great splendor,\r\nrespecting the national religion, observing the Mosaic law with great\r\nexactness, and aiming at the favor of the people. He inherited the taste\r\nof his great progenitor for palace building, and theatrical\r\nrepresentations. He greatly improved Jerusalem, and strengthened its\r\nfortifications, and yet he was only a vassal king. He reigned by the favor\r\nof Rome, on whom he was dependent, and whom he feared, like other kings\r\nand princes of the earth, for the emperor was alone supreme.\r\n\r\n(M261) Agrippa sullied his fair fame by being a persecutor of the\r\nChristians, and died in the forty-fourth year of his age, having reigned\r\nseven years over part of his dominions, and three over the whole of\r\nPalestine. He died in extreme agony from internal pains, being “eaten of\r\nworms.” He left one son, Agrippa, and three daughters, Drusilla, Berenice,\r\nand Mariamne, the two first of whom married princes.\r\n\r\n(M262) On his death Judea relapsed into a Roman province, his son,\r\nAgrippa, being only seventeen years of age, and too young to manage such a\r\nturbulent, unreasonable, and stiff-necked people as the Jews, rent by\r\nperpetual feuds and party animosities, and which seem to have\r\ncharacterized them ever since the captivity, when they renounced idolatry\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n(M263) What were these parties? For their opinions and struggles and\r\nquarrels form no inconsiderable part of the internal history of the Jews,\r\nboth under the Asmonæan and Idumean dynasties.\r\n\r\n(M264) The most powerful and numerous were the Pharisees, and most popular\r\nwith the nation. The origin of this famous sect is involved in obscurity,\r\nbut probably arose not long after the captivity. They were the orthodox\r\nparty. They clung to the Law of Moses in its most minute observances, and\r\nto all the traditions of their religion. They were earnest, fierce,\r\nintolerant, and proud. They believed in angels, and in immortality. They\r\nwere bold and heroic in war, and intractable and domineering in peace.\r\nThey were great zealots, devoted to proselytism. They were austere in\r\nlife, and despised all who were not. They were learned and decorous, and\r\npragmatical. Their dogmatism knew no respite or palliation. They were\r\npredestinarians, and believed in the servitude of the will. They were seen\r\nin public with ostentatious piety. They made long prayers, fasted with\r\nrigor, scrupulously observed the Sabbath, and paid tithes to the cheapest\r\nherbs. They assumed superiority in social circles, and always took the\r\nuppermost seats in the synagogue. They displayed on their foreheads and\r\nthe hem of their garments, slips of parchment inscribed with sentences\r\nfrom the law. They were regarded as models of virtue and excellence, but\r\nwere hypocrites in the observance of the weightier matters of justice and\r\nequity. They were, of course, the most bitter adversaries of the faith\r\nwhich Christ revealed, and were ever in the ranks of persecution. They\r\nresembled the most austere of the Dominican monks in the Middle Ages. They\r\nwere the favorite teachers and guides of the people, whom they incited in\r\ntheir various seditions. They were theologians who stood at the summit of\r\nlegal Judaism. “They fenced round their law hedges whereby its precepts\r\nwere guarded against any possible infringement.” And they contrived, by an\r\nartful and technical interpretation, to find statutes which favored their\r\nends. They wrought out asceticism into a system, and observed the most\r\npainful ceremonials—the ancestors of rigid monks; and they united a\r\nspecious casuistry, not unlike the Jesuits, to excuse the violation of the\r\n_spirit_ of the law. They were a hierarchical caste, whose ambition was to\r\ngovern, and to govern by legal technicalities. They were utterly deficient\r\nin the virtues of humility and toleration, and as such, peculiarly\r\noffensive to the Great Teacher when he propounded the higher code of love\r\nand forgiveness. Outwardly, however, they were the most respectable as\r\nwell as honorable men of the nation—dignified, decorous, and studious of\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\n(M265) The next great party was that of the Sadducees, who aimed to\r\nrestore the original Mosaic religion in its purity, and expunge every\r\nthing which had been added by tradition. But they were deficient in a\r\nprofound sense of religion, denied the doctrine of immortality, and hence\r\nall punishment in a future life. They made up for their denial of the\r\nfuture by a rigid punishment of all crimes. They inculcated a belief of\r\nDivine Providence by whom all crime was supposed to be avenged in this\r\nworld. The party was not so popular as that of their rivals, but embraced\r\nmen of high rank. In common with the Pharisees, they maintained the\r\nstrictness of the Jewish code, and professed great uprightness of morals.\r\nThey had, however, no true, deep religious life, and were cold and\r\nheartless in their dispositions. They were mostly men of ease and wealth,\r\nand satisfied with earthly enjoyments, and inclined to the epicureanism\r\nwhich marked many of the Greek philosophers. Nor did they escape the\r\nhypocrisy which disgraced the Pharisees, and their bitter opposition to\r\nthe truths of Christianity.\r\n\r\n(M266) In addition to these two great parties which controlled the people,\r\nwere the Essenes. But they lived apart from men, in the deserts round the\r\nDead Sea, and dreaded cities as nurseries of vice. They allowed no women\r\nto come within their settlements. They were recruited by strangers and\r\nproselytes, who thought all pleasure to be a sin. They established a\r\ncommunity of goods, and prosecuted the desire of riches. They were clothed\r\nin white garments which they never changed, and regulated their lives by\r\nthe severest forms. They abstained from animal food, and lived on roots\r\nand bread. They worked and ate in silence, and observed the Sabbath with\r\ngreat precision. They were great students, and were rigid in morals, and\r\nbelieved in immortality. They abhorred oaths, and slavery, and idolatry.\r\nThey embraced the philosophy of the Orientals, and supposed that matter\r\nwas evil, and that mind was divine. They were mystics who reveled in the\r\npleasures of abstract contemplation. Their theosophy was sublime, but\r\nBrahminical. Practically they were industrious, ascetic, and devout—the\r\nprecursors of those monks who fled from the abodes of man, and filled the\r\nsolitudes of Upper Egypt and Arabia and Palestine, the loftiest and most\r\nmisguided of the Christian sects in the second and third centuries, But\r\nthe Essenes had no direct influence over the people of Judea like the\r\nPharisees and Sadducees, except in encouraging obedience and charity.\r\n\r\n(M267) All these sects were in a flourishing state on the death of\r\nAgrippa. Judea was henceforth to be ruled directly by Roman governors.\r\nCuspius Fadus, Tiberius Alexander, Ventidius Cumanus, Felix Portius,\r\nFestus Albinus, and Gessius Florus successively administered the affairs\r\nof a discontented province. Their brief administrations were marked by\r\nfamines and tumults. King Agrippa, meanwhile, with mere nominal power,\r\nresided in Jerusalem, in the palace of the Asmonæan princes, which stood\r\non Mount Zion, toward the temple. Robbers infested the country, and\r\nmurders and robbery were of constant occurrence. High priests were set up,\r\nand dethroned. The people were oppressed by taxation and irritated by\r\npillage. Prodigies, wild and awful, filled the land with dread of\r\napproaching calamities. Fanatics alarmed the people. The Christians\r\npredicted the ruin of the State. Never was a population of three millions\r\nof people more discontented and oppressed. Outrage, and injustice, and\r\ntumults, and insurrections, marked the doomed people. The governors were\r\ninsulted, and massacred the people in retaliation. Florus, at one time,\r\ndestroyed three thousand six hundred people, A.D. 66. Open war was\r\napparent to the more discerning, Agrippa in vain counseled moderation and\r\nreconciliation, showing the people how vain resistance would be to the\r\noverwhelming power of Rome, which had subdued the world; and that the\r\nrefusal of tribute, and the demolition of Roman fortifications, were overt\r\nacts of war. But he talked to people doomed. Every day new causes of\r\ndiscord arose. Some of the higher orders were disposed to be prudent, but\r\nthe people generally were filled with bigotry and fanaticism. Some of the\r\nboldest of the war party one day seized the fortress of Masada, near the\r\nDead Sea, built by Jonathan the Maccabean, and fortified by Herod. The\r\nRoman garrison was put to the sword, and the banner of revolt was\r\nunfolded. In the city of Jerusalem, the blinded people refused to receive,\r\nas was customary, the gifts and sacrifices of foreign potentates offered\r\nin the temple to the God of the Jews. This was an insult and a declaration\r\nof war, which the chief priests and Pharisees attempted in vain to\r\nprevent. The insurgents, urged by zealots and assassins, even set fire to\r\nthe palace of the high priest and of Agrippa and Berenice, and also to the\r\npublic archives, where the bonds of creditors were deposited, which\r\ndestroyed the power of the rich. They then carried the important citadel\r\nof Antonia, and stormed the palace. A fanatic, by the name of Manahem, son\r\nof Judas of Galilee, openly proclaimed the doctrine that it was impious to\r\nown any king but God, and treason to pay tribute to Cæsar. He became the\r\nleader of the war party because he was the most unscrupulous and zealous,\r\nas is always the case in times of excitement and passion. He entered the\r\ncity, in the pomp of a conqueror, and became the captain of the forces,\r\nwhich took the palace and killed the defenders. The high priest, Ananias,\r\nstriving to secure order, was stoned. Then followed dissensions between\r\nthe insurgents themselves, during which Manahem was killed. Eleazar,\r\nanother chieftain, pressed the siege of the towers, defended by Roman\r\nsoldiers, which were taken, and the defenders massacred. Meanwhile, twenty\r\nthousand Jews were slain by the Greeks in Cæsarea, which drove the nation\r\nto madness, and led to a general insurrection in Syria, and a bloody\r\nstrife between the Greco-Syrians and Jews, There were commotions in all\r\nquarters—wars and rumors of wars, so that men fled to the mountains,\r\nWherever the Jews had settled were commotions and massacres, especially at\r\nAlexandria, when fifty thousand bodies were heaped up for burial.\r\n\r\n(M268) Nero was now on the imperial throne, and stringent measures were\r\nadopted to suppress the revolt of the Jews, now goaded to desperation by\r\nthe remembrance of their oppressions, and the conviction that every man’s\r\nhand was against them. Certius, the prefect of Syria, advanced with ten\r\nthousand Roman troops and thirteen hundred allies, and desperate war\r\nseemed now inevitable. Agrippa, knowing how fatal it would be to the\r\nJewish nation, attempted to avert it. He argued to infatuated men. Certius\r\nundertook to storm Jerusalem, the head-quarters of the insurrection, but\r\nfailed, and was obliged to retreat, with loss of a great part of his\r\narmy—a defeat such as the Romans had not received since Varus was\r\noverpowered in the forests of Germany.\r\n\r\n(M269) Judea was now in open rebellion against the whole power of Rome—a\r\nmad and desperate revolt, which could not end but in the political ruin of\r\nthe nation. Great preparations were made for the approaching contest, in\r\nwhich the Jews were to fight single-handed and unassisted by allies. The\r\nfortified posts were in the hands of the insurgents, but they had no\r\norganized and disciplined forces, and were divided among themselves.\r\nAgrippa, the representative of the Herodian kings, openly espoused the\r\ncause of Rome. The only hope of the Jews was in their stern fanaticism,\r\ntheir stubborn patience, and their daring valor. They were to be justified\r\nfor their insurrection by all those principles which animate oppressed\r\npeople striving to be free, and they had glorious precedents in the\r\nvictories of the Maccabees; but it was their misfortune to contend against\r\nthe armies of the masters of the world. They were not strong enough for\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\n(M270) The news of the insurrection, and the defeat of a Roman prefect,\r\nmade a profound sensation at Rome. Although Nero affected to treat the\r\naffair with levity, he selected, however, the ablest general of the\r\nempire, Vespasian, and sent him to Syria. The storm broke out in Galilee,\r\nwhose mountain fastnesses were intrusted by the Jews to Joseph, the son of\r\nMatthias—lineally descended from an illustrious priestly family, with the\r\nblood of the Asmonæan running in his veins—a man of culture and learning—a\r\nPharisee who had at first opposed the insurrection, but drawn into it\r\nafter the defeat of Certius. He is better known to us as the historian\r\nJosephus. His measures of defence were prudent and vigorous, and he\r\nendeavored to unite the various parties in the contest which he knew was\r\ndesperate. He raised an army of one hundred thousand men, and introduced\r\nthe Roman discipline, but was impeded in his measures by party dissensions\r\nand by treachery. In the city of Jerusalem, Ananias, the high priest, took\r\nthe lead, but had to contend with fanatics and secret enemies.\r\n\r\n(M271) The first memorable event of the war was the unsuccessful\r\nexpedition against Ascalon, sixty-five miles from Jerusalem, in which\r\nRoman discipline prevailed against numbers. This was soon followed by the\r\nadvance of Vespasian to Ptolemais, while Titus, his lieutenant and son,\r\nsailed from Alexandria to join him. Vespasian had an army of sixty\r\nthousand veterans. Josephus could not openly contend against this force,\r\nbut strengthened his fortified cities. Vespasian advanced cautiously in\r\nbattle array, and halted on the frontiers of Galilee. The Jews, under\r\nJosephus, fled in despair. Gabaia was the first city which fell, and its\r\ninhabitants were put to the sword—a stern vengeance which the Romans often\r\nexercised, to awe their insurgent enemies. Josephus retired to Tiberius,\r\nhopeless and discouraged, and exhorted the people of Jerusalem either to\r\nre-enforce him with a powerful army, or make submission to the Romans.\r\nThey did neither. He then threw himself into Jotaphata, where the\r\nstrongest of the Galilean warriors had intrenched themselves. Vespasian\r\nadvanced against the city with his whole army, and drew a line of\r\ncircumvallation around it, and then commenced the attack. The city stood\r\non the top of a lofty hill, and was difficult of access, and well supplied\r\nwith provisions. As the works of the Romans arose around the city, its\r\nwalls were raised thirty-five feet by the defenders, while they issued out\r\nin sallies and fought with the courage of despair. The city could not be\r\ntaken by assault, and the siege was converted into a blockade. The\r\nbesieged, supplied with provisions, issued out from behind their\r\nfortifications, and destroyed the works of the Romans. The fearful\r\nbattering-rams of the besiegers were destroyed by the arts and inventions\r\nof the besieged. The catapults and scorpions swept the walls, and the huge\r\nstones began to tell upon the turrets and the towers. The whole city was\r\nsurrounded by triple lines of heavy armed soldiers, ready for assault. The\r\nJews resorted to all kinds of expedients, even to the pouring of boiling\r\noil on the heads of their assailants. The Roman general was exasperated at\r\nthe obstinate resistance, and proceeded by more cautious measures. He\r\nraised the embankments, and fortified them with towers, in which he placed\r\nslingers and archers, whose missiles told with terrible effect on those\r\nwho defended the walls. Forty-seven days did the gallant defenders resist\r\nall the resources of Vespasian, But they were at length exhausted, and\r\ntheir ranks were thinned, Once again a furious assault was made by the\r\nwhole army, and Titus scaled the walls. The city fell with the loss of\r\nforty thousand men on both sides, and Josephus surrendered to the will of\r\nGod, but was himself spared by the victors by adroit flatteries, in which\r\nhe predicted the elevation of Vespasian to the throne of Nero.\r\n\r\n(M272) It would be interesting to detail the progress of the war, but our\r\nlimits forbid. The reader is referred to Josephus. City after city\r\ngradually fell into the hands of Vespasian, who now established himself in\r\nCæsarea. Joppa shared the fate of Jotaphata; the city was razed, but the\r\ncitadel was fortified by the Romans.\r\n\r\n(M273) The intelligence of these disasters filled Jerusalem with\r\nconsternation and mourning, for scarcely a family had not to deplore the\r\nloss of some of its members. Tiberius and Tarichea, on the banks of the\r\nbeautiful lake of Galilee, were the next which fell, followed by atrocious\r\nmassacres, after the fashion of war in those days. Galilee stood appalled,\r\nand all its cities but three surrendered. Of these Gamala, the capital,\r\nwas the strongest, and more inaccessible than Jotaphata. It was built upon\r\na precipice, and was crowded with fugitives, and well provisioned. But it\r\nwas finally taken, as well as Gischala and Itabyriun, and all Galilee was\r\nin the hands of the Romans.\r\n\r\n(M274) Jerusalem, meanwhile, was the scene of factions and dissensions. It\r\nmight have re-enforced the strongholds of Galilee, but gave itself up to\r\nparty animosities, which weakened its strength. Had the Jews been united,\r\nthey might have offered a more successful resistance. But their fate was\r\nsealed. I can not describe the various intrigues and factions which\r\nparalyzed the national arm, and forewarned the inhabitants of their doom.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Nero was assassinated, and Vespasian was elevated to the\r\nimperial throne. He sent his son Titus to complete the subjugation which\r\nhad hitherto resisted his conquering legions.\r\n\r\n(M275) Jerusalem, in those days of danger and anxiety, was still rent by\r\nfactions, and neglected her last chance of organizing her forces to resist\r\nthe common enemy. Never was a city more insensible of its doom. Three\r\ndistinct parties were at war with each other, shedding each others’ blood,\r\nreckless of all consequences, callous, fierce, desperate. At length the\r\narmy of Titus advanced to the siege of the sacred city, still strong and\r\nwell provisioned. Four legions, with mercenary troops and allies, burning\r\nto avenge the past, encamped beneath the walls, destroying the orchards\r\nand olive-grounds and gardens which everywhere gladdened the beautiful\r\nenvirons. The city was fortified with three walls where not surrounded by\r\nimpassable ravines, not one within the other, but inclosing distinct\r\nquarters; and these were of great strength, the stones of which were in\r\nsome parts thirty-five feet long, and so thick that even the heaviest\r\nbattering-rams could make no impression. One hundred and sixty-four towers\r\nsurmounted these heavy walls, one of which was one hundred and forty feet\r\nhigh, and forty-three feet square; another, of white marble, seventy-six\r\nfeet in height, was built of stones thirty-five feet long, and seventeen\r\nand a half wide, and eight and a half high, joined together with the most\r\nperfect masonry. Within these walls and towers was the royal palace,\r\nsurrounded by walls and towers of equal strength. The fortress of Antonia,\r\nseventy feet high, stood on a rock of ninety feet elevation, with\r\nprecipitous sides. High above all these towers and hills, and fortresses,\r\nstood the temple, on an esplanade covering a square of a furlong on each\r\nside. The walls which surrounded this fortress-temple were built of vast\r\nstones, and were of great height; and within these walls, on each side,\r\nwas a spacious double portico fifty-two and a half feet broad, with a\r\nceiling of cedar exquisitely carved, supported by marble columns\r\nforty-three and three-quarters feet high, hewn out of single stones. There\r\nwere one hundred and sixty-two of these beautiful columns. Within this\r\nquadrangle was an inner wall, seventy feet in height, inclosing the inner\r\ncourt, around which, in the interior, was another still more splendid\r\nportico, entered by brazen gates adorned with gold. These doors, or gates,\r\nwere fifty-two and a half feet high and twenty-six and a quarter wide.\r\nEach gateway had two lofty pillars, twenty-one feet in circumference. The\r\ngate called Beautiful was eighty-seven and a half feet high, made of\r\nCorinthian brass, and plated with gold. The quadrangle, entered by nine of\r\nthese gates, inclosed still another, within which was the temple itself,\r\nwith its glittering façade. This third and inner quadrangle was entered by\r\na gateway tower one hundred and thirty-two and a half feet high and\r\nforty-three and a half wide. “At a distance the temple looked like a\r\nmountain of snow fretted with golden pinnacles.” With what emotions Titus\r\nmust have surveyed this glorious edifice, as the sun rising above Mount\r\nMoriah gilded its gates and pinnacles—soon to be so utterly demolished\r\nthat not one stone should be left upon another.\r\n\r\n(M276) Around the devoted city Titus erected towers which overlooked the\r\nwalls, from which he discharged his destructive missiles, while the\r\nbattering-rams played against the walls, where they were weakest. The\r\nfirst wall was soon abandoned, and five days after the second was\r\npenetrated, after a furious combat, and Titus took possession of the lower\r\ncity, where most of the people lived.\r\n\r\nThe precipitous heights of Zion, the tower of Antonia and the temple still\r\nremained, and although the cause was hopeless, the Jews would hear of no\r\nterms of surrender. Titus used every means. So did Josephus, who harangued\r\nthe people at a safe distance. The most obstinate fury was added to\r\npresumptuous, vain confidence, perhaps allied with utter distrust of the\r\npromises of enemies whom they had offended past forgiveness.\r\n\r\n(M277) At length famine pressed. No grain was to be bought. The wealthy\r\nsecreted their food. All kind feelings were lost in the general misery.\r\nWives snatched the last morsel from their family and weary husbands, and\r\nchildren from their parents. The houses were full of dying and the dead, a\r\nheavy silence oppressed every one, yet no complaints were made. They\r\nsuffered in sullen gloom, and despair. From the 14th of April to the 19th\r\nof July, A.D. 70, from one hundred thousand to five hundred thousand,\r\naccording to different estimates, were buried or thrown from the walls. A\r\nmeasure of wheat sold for a talent, and the dunghills were raked for\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\n(M278) When all was ready, the assault on the places which remained\r\ncommenced. On the 5th of July the fortress of Antonia was taken, and the\r\nsiege of the temple was pressed. Titus made one more attempt to persuade\r\nits defenders to surrender, wishing to save the sacred edifice, but they\r\nwere deaf and obstinate. They continued to fight, inch by inch, exhausted\r\nby famine, and reduced to despair. They gnawed their leathern belts, and\r\nate their very children. On the 8th of August the wall inclosing the\r\nportico, or cloisters, was scaled. On the 10th the temple itself, a\r\npowerful fortress, fell, with all its treasures, into the hands of the\r\nvictors. The soldiers gazed with admiration on the plates of gold, and the\r\ncurious workmanship of the sacred vessels. All that could be destroyed by\r\nfire was burned, and all who guarded the precincts were killed.\r\n\r\n(M279) Still the palace and the upper city held out. Titus promised to\r\nspare the lives of the defenders if they would instantly surrender. But\r\nthey still demanded terms. Titus, in a fury, swore that the whole\r\nsurviving population should be exterminated. It was not till the 7th of\r\nSeptember that this last bulwark was captured, so obstinately did the\r\nstarving Jews defend themselves. A miscellaneous slaughter commenced, till\r\nthe Romans were weary of their work of vengeance. During the whole siege\r\none million one hundred thousand were killed, and ninety-seven thousand\r\nmade prisoners, since a large part of the population of Judea had taken\r\nrefuge within the walls. During the whole war one million three hundred\r\nand fifty-six thousand were killed.\r\n\r\nThus fell Jerusalem, after a siege of five months, the most desperate\r\ndefense of a capital in the history of war. It fell never to rise again as\r\na Jewish metropolis. Never had a city greater misfortunes. Never was\r\nheroism accompanied with greater fanaticism. Never was a prophecy more\r\nsignally fulfilled.\r\n\r\n(M280) The fall of Jerusalem was succeeded by bloody combats before the\r\nwhole country was finally subdued. With the final conquest the Jews were\r\ndispersed among the nations, and their nationality was at an end. Their\r\npolitical existence was annihilated. The capital was destroyed, the temple\r\ndemolished, and the royal house extinguished, and the high priesthood\r\nburied amid the ruins of the sacred places.\r\n\r\nWith the occupation of Palestine by strangers, and the final dispersion of\r\nthe Jews over all nations, who, without a country, and without friends,\r\nmaintained their institutions, their religion, their name, their\r\npeculiarities, and their associations, we leave the subject—so full of\r\nmournful interest, and of impressive lessons. The student of history\r\nshould see in their prosperity and misfortunes the overruling Providence\r\nvindicating his promises, and the awful majesty of eternal laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRECIAN STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEOGRAPHY OF ANCIENT GREECE AND ITS EARLY INHABITANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M281) We have seen that the Oriental-world, so favored by nature, so rich\r\nin fields, in flocks, and fruits, failed to realize the higher destiny of\r\nman. In spite of all the advantages of nature, he was degraded by debasing\r\nsuperstitions, and by the degeneracy which wealth and ease produced. He\r\nwas enslaved by vices and by despots. The Assyrian and Babylonian kingdom,\r\nthat “head of gold,” as seen in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, became inferior to\r\nthe “breast and arms of silver,” as represented by the Persian Empire, and\r\nthis, in turn, became subject to the Grecian States, “the belly and the\r\nthighs of brass.” It is the nobler Hellenic race, with its original\r\ngenius, its enterprise, its stern and rugged nature, strengthened by toil,\r\nand enterprise, and war, that we are now to contemplate. It is Greece—the\r\nland of song, of art, of philosophy—the land of heroes and freemen, to\r\nwhich we now turn our eyes—the most interesting, and the most famous of\r\nthe countries of antiquity.\r\n\r\n(M282) Let us first survey that country in all its stern ruggedness and\r\npicturesque beauty. It was small compared with Assyria or Persia. Its\r\noriginal name was Hellas, designated by a little district of Thessaly,\r\nwhich lay on the southeast verge of Europe, and extended in length from\r\nthe thirty-sixth to the fortieth degree of latitude. It contained, with\r\nits islands, only twenty-one thousand two hundred and ninety square\r\nmiles—less than Portugal or Ireland, but its coasts exceeded the whole\r\nPyrenean peninsula. Hellas is itself a peninsula, bounded on the north by\r\nthe Cambunian and Ceraunian mountains, which separated it from Macedonia;\r\non the east by the Ægean Sea, (Archipelago), which separated it from Asia\r\nMinor; on the south by the Cretan Sea, and on the west by the Ionian Sea.\r\n\r\n(M283) The northern part of this country of the Hellenes is traversed by a\r\nrange of mountains, commencing at Acra Ceraunia, on the Adriatic, and\r\ntending southeast above Dodona, in Epirus, till they join the Cambunian\r\nmountains, near Mount Olympus, which run along the coast of the Ægean till\r\nthey terminate in the southeastern part of Thessaly, under the names of\r\nOssa, Pelion, and Tisæus. The great range of Pindus enters Greece at the\r\nsources of the Peneus, where it crosses the Cambunian mountains, and\r\nextends at first south, and then east to the sea, nearly inclosing\r\nThessaly, and dividing it from the rest of Greece. After throwing out the\r\nvarious spurs of Othrys, Œta, and Corax, it loses itself in those famous\r\nhaunts of the Muses—the heights of Parnassus and Helicon, in Phocis and\r\nBœotia, In the southern part of Greece are the mountains which intersect\r\nthe Peloponnesus in almost every part, the principal of which are Scollis,\r\nAroanii, and Taygetus. We can not enumerate the names of all these\r\nmountains; it is enough to say that no part of Europe, except Switzerland,\r\nis so covered with mountains as Greece, some of which attain the altitude\r\nof perpetual snow. Only a small part of the country is level.\r\n\r\n(M284) The rivers, again, are numerous, but more famous for associations\r\nthan for navigable importance. The Peneus which empties itself into the\r\nÆgean, a little below Tempe; the Achelous, which flows into the Ionian\r\nSea; the Alpheus, flowing into the Ionian Sea; and the Eurotas, which\r\nenters the Laconican Gulf, are among the most considerable. The lakes are\r\nnumerous, but not large. The coasts are lined by bays and promontories,\r\nfavorable to navigation in its infancy, and for fishing. The adjacent seas\r\nare full of islands, memorable in Grecian history, some of which are of\r\nconsiderable size.\r\n\r\n(M285) Thus intersected in all parts with mountains, and deeply indented\r\nby the sea, Greece was both mountainous and maritime. The mountains, the\r\nrivers, the valleys, the sea, the islands contributed to make the people\r\nenterprising and poetical, and as each State was divided from every other\r\nState by mountains, or valleys, or gulfs, political liberty was\r\nengendered. The difficulties of cultivating a barren soil on the highlands\r\ninured the inhabitants to industry and economy, as in Scotland and New\r\nEngland, while the configuration of the country strengthened the powers of\r\ndefense, and shut the people up from those invasions which have so often\r\nsubjugated a plain and level country. These natural divisions also kept\r\nthe States from political union, and fostered a principle of repulsion,\r\nand led to an indefinite multiplication of self-governing towns, and to\r\ngreat individuality of character.\r\n\r\n(M286) Situated in the same parallels of latitude as Asia Minor, and the\r\nsouth of Italy and Spain, Greece produced wheat, barley, flax, wine, oil,\r\nin the earliest times. The cultivation of the vine and the olive was\r\npeculiarly careful. Barley cakes were more eaten than wheaten. All\r\nvegetables and fish were abundant and cheap. But little fresh meat was\r\neaten. Corn also was imported in considerable quantities by the maritime\r\nStates in exchange for figs, olives, and oil. The climate, clear and\r\nbeautiful to modern Europeans, was less genial than that of Asia Minor,\r\nbut more bracing and variable. It also varied in various sections.\r\n\r\nThese various sections, or provinces, or states, into which Greece was\r\ndivided, claim a short notice.\r\n\r\n(M287) The largest and most northerly State was Epirus, containing four\r\nthousand two hundred and sixty square miles, bounded on the north by\r\nMacedonia, on the east by Thessaly, on the south by Acarnania, and on the\r\nwest by the Ionian Sea. Though mountainous, it was fertile, and produced\r\nexcellent cattle and horses. Of the interesting places of Epirus,\r\nmemorable in history, ranks first Dodona, celebrated for its oracle, the\r\nmost ancient in Greece, and only inferior to that of Delphi. It was\r\nfounded by the Pelasgi before the Trojan war and was dedicated to Jupiter.\r\nThe temple was surrounded by a grove of oak, but the oracles were latterly\r\ndelivered by the murmuring of fountains. On the west of Epirus is the\r\nisland of Corcyra (Corfu), famous for the shipwreck of Ulysses, and for\r\nthe gardens of Aleinous, and for having given rise to the Peloponnesian\r\nwar. Epirus is also distinguished as the country over which Pyrrhus ruled.\r\nThe Acheron, supposed to communicate with the infernal regions, was one of\r\nits rivers.\r\n\r\n(M288) West of Epirus was Thessaly, and next to it in size, containing\r\nfour thousand two hundred and sixty square miles. It was a plain inclosed\r\nby mountains; next to Bœotia, the most fertile of all the States of\r\nGreece, abounding in oil, wine, and corn, and yet one of the weakest and\r\nmost insignificant politically. The people were rich, but perfidious. The\r\nriver Peneus flowed through the entire extent of the country, and near its\r\nmouth was the vale of Tempe, the most beautiful valley in Greece, guarded\r\nby four strong fortresses.\r\n\r\n(M289) At some distance from the mouth of the Peneus was Larissa, the city\r\nof Achilles, and the general capital of the Pelasgi. At the southern\r\nextremity of the lake Cælas, the largest in Thessaly, was Pheræ, one of\r\nthe most ancient cities in Greece, and near it was the fountain of\r\nHyperia. In the southern part of Thessaly was Pharsalia, the battle-ground\r\nbetween Cæsar and Pompey, and near it was Pyrrha, formerly called Hellas,\r\nwhere was the tomb of Hellen, son of Deucalion, whose descendants, Æolus,\r\nDorus and Ion, are said to have given name to the three nations, Æolians,\r\nDorians, and Ionians, Still further south, between the inaccessible cliffs\r\nof Mount Œta and the marshes which skirt the Maliaeus Bay, were the\r\ndefiles of Thermopylæ, where Leonidas and three hundred heroes died\r\ndefending the pass, against the army of Xerxes, and which in one place was\r\nonly twenty-five feet wide, so that, in so narrow a defile, the Spartans\r\nwere able to withstand for three days the whole power of Persia. In this\r\nfamous pass the Amphictyonic council met annually to deliberate on the\r\ncommon affairs of all the States.\r\n\r\n(M290) South of Epirus, on the Ionian Sea, and west of Ætolia, was\r\nAcarnania, occupied by a barbarous people before the Pelasgi settled in\r\nit. It had no historic fame, except as furnishing on its waters a place\r\nfor the decisive battle which Augustus gained over Antony, at Actium, and\r\nfor the islands on the coast, one of which, Ithaca, a rugged and\r\nmountainous island, was the residence of Ulysses.\r\n\r\n(M291) Ætolia, to the east of Acarnania, and south of Thessaly, and\r\nseparated from Achaia by the Corinthian Gulf, contained nine hundred and\r\nthirty square miles. Its principal city was Thermon, considered\r\nimpregnable, at which were held splendid games and festivals. The Ætolians\r\nwere little known in the palmy days of Athens and Sparta, except as a\r\nhardy race, but covetous and faithless.\r\n\r\n(M292) Doris was a small tract to the east of Ætolia, inhabited by one of\r\nthe most ancient of the Greek tribes—the Dorians, called so from Dorus,\r\nson of Deucalion, and originally inhabited that part of Thessaly in which\r\nwere the mountains of Olympus and Ossa. From this section they were driven\r\nby the Cadmeans. Doris was the abode of the Heraclidæ when exiled from the\r\nPeloponnesus, and which was given to Hyllas, the son of Hercules, in\r\ngratitude by Ægiminius, the king, who was reinstated by the hero in his\r\ndispossessed dominion.\r\n\r\n(M293) Locri Ozolæ was another small State, south of Doris, from which it\r\nis separated by the range of the Parnassus situated on the Corinthian\r\nGulf, the most important city of which was Salona, surrounded on all sides\r\nby hills. Naupactus was also a considerable place, known in the Middle\r\nAges as Lepanto, where was fought one of the decisive naval battles of the\r\nworld, in which the Turks were defeated by the Venetians. It contained\r\nthree hundred and fifty square miles.\r\n\r\n(M294) Phocis was directly to the east, bounded on the north by Doris and\r\nthe Locri Epicnemidii, and south by the Corinthian Gulf. This State\r\nembraced six hundred and ten square miles. The Phocians are known in\r\nhistory from the sacred or Phocian war, which broke out in 357 B.C., in\r\nconsequence of refusing to pay a fine imposed by the Amphictyonic council.\r\nThe Thebans and Locrians carried on this war successfully, joined by\r\nPhilip of Macedon, who thus paved the way for the sovereignty of Greece.\r\nOne among the most noted places was Crissa, famed for the Pythian games,\r\nand Delphi, renowned for its oracle sacred to Apollo. The priestess,\r\nPythia, sat on a sacred tripod over the mouth of a cave, and pronounced\r\nher oracles in verse or prose. Those who consulted her made rich presents,\r\nfrom which Delphi became vastly enriched. Above Delphi towers Parnassus,\r\nthe highest mountain in central Greece, near whose summit was the supposed\r\nresidence of Deucalion.\r\n\r\n(M295) Bœotia was the richest State in Greece, so far as fertility of soil\r\ncan make a State rich. It was bounded on the north by the territory of the\r\nLocri, on the west by Phocis, on the south by Attica, and on the east by\r\nthe Eubœan Sea. It contained about one thousand square miles. Its\r\ninhabitants were famed for their stolidity, and yet it furnished Hesiod,\r\nPindar, Corinna, and Plutarch to the immortal catalogue of names. Its men,\r\nif stupid, were brave, and its women were handsome. It was originally\r\ninhabited by barbarous tribes, all connected with the Leleges. In its\r\nsouthwestern part was the famous Helicon, famed as the seat of Apollo and\r\nthe Muses, and on the southern border was Mount Cithæron, to the north of\r\nwhich was Platea, where the Persians were defeated by the confederate\r\nGreeks under Pausanias. Bœotia contained the largest lake in\r\nGreece—Copaias, famed for eels. On the borders of this lake was Coronea,\r\nwhere the Thebans were defeated by the Spartans. To the north of Coronea\r\nwas Chæronea, where was fought the great battle with Philip, which\r\nsubverted the liberties of Greece. To the north of the river Æsopus, a\r\nsluggish stream, was Thebes, the capital of Bœotia, founded by Cadmus,\r\nwhose great generals, Epaminondas and Pelopidas, made it, for a time, one\r\nof the great powers of Greece.\r\n\r\n(M296) The most famous province of Greece was Attica, bounded on the north\r\nby the mountains Cithæron and Parnes, on the west by the bay of Saronicus,\r\non the east by the Myrtoum Sea. It contained but seven hundred square\r\nmiles. It derived its name from Atthis, a daughter of Cranaus; but its\r\nearliest name was Cecropia, from its king, Cecrops. It was divided, in the\r\ntime of Cecrops, into four tribes. On its western extremity, on the shores\r\nof the Saronic Gulf, stood Eleusis, the scene of the Eleusinian mysteries,\r\nthe most famous of all the religious ceremonials of Greece, sacred to\r\nCeres, and celebrated every four years, and lasting for nine days.\r\nOpposite to Eleusis was Salamis, the birthplace of Ajax, Teucer, and\r\nSolon. There the Persian fleet of Xerxes was defeated by the Athenians.\r\nThe capital, Athens, founded by Cecrops, 1556 B.C., received its name from\r\nthe goddess Neith, an Egyptian deity, known by the Greeks as Athena, or\r\nMinerva. Its population, in the time of Pericles, was one hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand. The southernmost point of Attica was Sunium, sacred to\r\nMinerva; Marathon, the scene of the most brilliant victory which the\r\nAthenians ever fought, was in the eastern part of Attica. To the southeast\r\nof Athens was Mount Hymettus, celebrated for its flowers and honey.\r\nBetween Hymettus and Marathon was Mount Pentelicus, famed for its marbles.\r\n\r\n(M297) Megaris, another small State, was at the west of Attica, between\r\nthe Corinthian and the Saronican gulfs. Its chief city, Megara, was a\r\nconsiderable place, defended by two citadels on the hills above it. It was\r\ncelebrated as the seat of the Megaric school of philosophy, founded by\r\nEuclid.\r\n\r\n(M298) The largest of the Grecian States was the famous peninsula known as\r\nthe Peloponnesus, entirely surrounded by water, except the isthmus of\r\nCorinth, four geographical miles wide. On the west was the Ionian Sea; on\r\nthe east the Saronic Gulf and the Myrtoum Sea; on the north the Corinthian\r\nGulf. It contained six thousand seven hundred and forty-five square miles.\r\nIt was divided into several States. It was said to be left by Hercules on\r\nhis death to the Heraclidæ, which they, with the assistance of the\r\nDorians, ultimately succeeded in regaining, about eighty years after the\r\nTrojan war.\r\n\r\nOf the six States into which the Peloponnesus was divided, Achaia was the\r\nnorthernmost, and was celebrated for the Achæan league, composed of its\r\nprincipal cities, as well us Corinth, Sicyon, Phlius, Arcadia, Argolis,\r\nLaconia, Megaris, and other cities and States.\r\n\r\n(M299) Southwest of Achaia was Elis, on the Ionian Sea, in which stood\r\nOlympia, where the Olympic games were celebrated every four years,\r\ninstituted by Hercules.\r\n\r\n(M300) Arcadia occupied the centre of the Peloponnesus, surrounded on all\r\nsides by lofty mountains—a rich and pastoral country, producing fine\r\nhorses and asses. It was the favorite residence of Pan, the god of\r\nshepherds, and its people were famed for their love of liberty and music.\r\n\r\n(M301) Argolis was the eastern portion of the Peloponnesus, watered by the\r\nSaronic Gulf, whose original inhabitants were Pelasgi. It boasted of the\r\ncities of Argos and Mycenæ, the former of which was the oldest city of\r\nGreece. Agamemnon reigned at Mycenæ, the most powerful of the kings of\r\nGreece during the Trojan war.\r\n\r\n(M302) Laconia, at the southeastern extremity of the peninsula, was the\r\nlargest and most important of the States of the Peloponnesus. It was\r\nrugged and mountainous, but its people were brave and noble. Its largest\r\ncity, Sparta, for several generations controlled the fortune of Greece,\r\nthe most warlike of the Grecian cities.\r\n\r\n(M303) Messenia was the southwestern part of the peninsula—mountainous,\r\nbut well watered, and abounding in pasture. It was early coveted by the\r\nLacedæmonians, inhabitants of Laconia, and was subjugated in a series of\r\nfamous wars, called the Messenian.\r\n\r\nSuch were the principal States of Greece. But in connection with these\r\nwere the islands in the seas which surrounded it, and these are nearly as\r\nfamous as the States on the main land.\r\n\r\n(M304) The most important of these was Crete, at the southern extremity of\r\nthe Ægean Sea. It was the fabled birthplace of Jupiter. To the south of\r\nThrace were Thasos, remarkable for fertility, and for mines of gold and\r\nsilver; Samothrace, celebrated for the mysteries of Cybele; Imbros, sacred\r\nto Ceres and Mercury. Lemnos, in latitude forty, equidistant from Mount\r\nAthos and the Hellespont, rendered infamous by the massacre of all the\r\nmale inhabitants of the island by the women. The island of Eubœa stretched\r\nalong the coast of Attica, Locris, and Bœotia, and was exceedingly\r\nfertile, and from this island the Athenians drew large supplies of\r\ncorn—the largest island in the Archipelago, next to Crete. Its principal\r\ncity was Chalcis, one of the strongest in Greece.\r\n\r\n(M305) To the southeast of Eubœa are the Cyclades—a group of islands of\r\nwhich Delos, Andros, Tenos, Myeonos, Naxos, Paros, Olearos, Siphnos,\r\nMelos, and Syros, were the most important. All these islands are famous\r\nfor temples and the birthplace of celebrated men.\r\n\r\n(M306) The islands called the Sporades lie to the south and east of the\r\nCyclades, among which are Amorgo, Ios, Sicinos, Thera, and Anaphe—some of\r\nwhich are barren, and others favorable to the vine.\r\n\r\n(M307) Besides these islands, which belong to the continent of Europe, are\r\nthose which belong to Asia—Tenedos, small but fertile; Lesbos, celebrated\r\nfor wine, the fourth in size of all the islands of the Ægean; Chios, also\r\nfamed for wine; Samos, famous for the worship of Juno, and the birthplace\r\nof Pythagoras; Patmos, used as a place of banishment; Cos, the birthplace\r\nof Apelles and Hippocrates, exceedingly fertile; and south of all, Rhodes,\r\nthe largest island of the Ægean, after Crete and Eubœa. It was famous for\r\nthe brazen and colossal statue of the sun, seventy cubits high. Its people\r\nwere great navigators, and their maritime laws were ultimately adopted by\r\nall the Greeks and Romans. It was also famous for its schools of art.\r\n\r\nSuch were the States and islands of Greece, mountainous, in many parts\r\nsterile, but filled with a hardy, bold, and adventurous race, whose\r\nexploits and arts were the glory of the ancient world.\r\n\r\n(M308) The various tribes and nations all belonged to that branch of the\r\nIndo-European race to which ethnographers have given the name of\r\nPelasgian. They were a people of savage manners, but sufficiently\r\ncivilised to till the earth, and build walled cities. Their religion was\r\npolytheistic—a personification of the elemental powers and the heavenly\r\nbodies. The Pelasgians occupied insulated points, but were generally\r\ndiffused throughout Greece; and they were probably a wandering people\r\nbefore they settled in Greece. The Greek traditions about their migration\r\nrests on no certain ground. Besides this race, concerning which we have no\r\nauthentic history, were the Leleges and Carians. But all of them were\r\nbarbarous, and have left no written records. Argos and Sicyon are said to\r\nbe Pelasgian cities, founded as far back as one thousand eight hundred and\r\nfifty-six years before Christ. It is also thought that Oriental elements\r\nentered into the early population of Greece. Cecrops imported into Attica\r\nEgyptian arts. Cadmus, the Phœnician, colonized Bœotia, and introduced\r\nweights and measures. Danaus, driven out of Egypt, gave his name to the\r\nwarlike Danai, and instructed the Pelasgian women of Argos in the mystic\r\nrites of Demetus. Pelope is supposed to have passed from Asia into Greece,\r\nwith great treasures, and his descendants occupied the throne of Argos.\r\n\r\n(M309) At a period before written history commences, the early inhabitants\r\nof Greece, whatever may have been their origin, which is involved in\r\nobscurity, were driven from their settlements by a warlike race, akin,\r\nhowever, to the Pelasgians. These conquerors were the Hellenes, who were\r\nbelieved to have issued from the district of Thessaly, north of Mount\r\nOthrys. They gave their name ultimately to the whole country. Divided into\r\nsmall settlements, they yet were bound together by language and customs,\r\nand cherished the idea of national unity. There were four chief divisions\r\nof this nation, the Dorians, Æolians, Achæans, and Ionians, traditionally\r\nsupposed to be descended from the three sons of Hellen, the son of\r\nDeucalion, Dorus, Æolus, and Xuthus, the last the father of Achæus, and\r\nJon. So the Greek poets represented the origin of the Hellenes—a people\r\nfond of adventure, and endowed by nature with vast capacities,\r\nsubsequently developed by education.\r\n\r\n(M310) Of these four divisions of the Hellenic race, the Æolians spread\r\nover northern Greece, and also occupied the western coast of the\r\nPeloponnesus and the Ionian islands. It continued, to the latest times, to\r\noccupy the greater part of Greece. The Achæans were the most celebrated in\r\nepic poetry, their name being used by Homer to denote all the Hellenic\r\ntribes which fought at Troy. They were the dominant people of the\r\nPeloponnesus, occupying the south and east, and the Arcadians the centre.\r\nThe Dorians and Ionians were of later celebrity; the former occupying a\r\nsmall patch of territory on the slopes of Mount Œta, north of Delphi; the\r\nlatter living on a narrow slip of the country along the northern coast of\r\nthe Peloponnesus, and extending eastward into Attica.\r\n\r\n(M311) The principal settlements of the Æolians lay around the Pagasæan\r\nGulf, and were blended with the Minyans, a race of Pelasgian adventurers\r\nknown in the Argonautic expedition, under Æolian leaders. In the north of\r\nBœotia arose the city of Orchomenus, whose treasures were compared by\r\nHomer to those of the Egyptian Thebes. Another seat of the Æolians was\r\nEphyra, afterward known as Corinth, where the “wily Sisyphus” ruled. He\r\nwas the father of Phocus, who gave his name to Phocis. The descendants of\r\nÆolus led also a colony to Elis, and another to Pylus. In general, the\r\nÆolians sought maritime settlements in northern Greece, and the western\r\nside of the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\n(M312) The Achæans were the dominant race, in very early times, of the\r\nsouth of Thessaly, and the eastern side of the Peloponnesus, whose chief\r\nseats were Phthia, where Achilles reigned, and Argolis. Thirlwall seems to\r\nthink they were a Pelasgian, rather than an Hellenic people. The ancient\r\ntraditions represent the sons of Achæus as migrating to Argos, where they\r\nmarried the daughters of Danaus the king, but did not mount the throne.\r\n\r\n(M313) The early fortunes of the Dorians are involved in great obscurity,\r\nnor is there much that is satisfactory in the early history of any of the\r\nHellenic tribes. Our information is chiefly traditional, derived from the\r\npoets. Dorus, the son of Deucalion, occupied the country over against\r\nPeloponnesus, on the opposite side of the Corinthian Gulf, comprising\r\nÆtolia, Phocis, and the Ozolian Locrians. Nor can the conquests of the\r\nDorians on the Peloponnesus be reconciled upon any other ground than that\r\nthey occupied a considerable tract of country.\r\n\r\n(M314) The early history of the Ionians is still more obscure. Ion, the\r\nson of Xuthus, is supposed to have led his followers from Thessaly to\r\nAttica, and to have conquered the Pelasgians, or effected peaceable\r\nsettlements with them. Then follows a series of legends which have more\r\npoetical than historical interest, but which will be briefly noticed in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGENDS OF ANCIENT GREECE.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M315) The Greeks possessed no authentic written history of that period\r\nwhich included the first appearance of the Hellenes in Thessaly to the\r\nfirst Olympiad, B.C. 776. This is called the heroic age, and is known to\r\nus only by legends and traditions, called myths. They pertain both to gods\r\nand men, and are connected with what we call mythology, which possesses no\r\nhistorical importance, although it is full of interest for its poetic\r\nlife. And as mythology is interwoven with the literature and the art of\r\nthe ancients, furnishing inexhaustible subjects for poets, painters, and\r\nsculptors, it can not be omitted wholly in the history of that classic\r\npeople, whose songs and arts have been the admiration of the world.\r\n\r\n(M316) We have space, however, only for those legends which are of\r\nuniversal interest, and will first allude to those which pertain to gods,\r\nsuch as appear most prominent in the poems of Hesiod and Homer.\r\n\r\n(M317) Zeus, or Jupiter, is the most important personage in the mythology\r\nof Greece. Although, chronologically, he comes after Kronos and Uranos, he\r\nwas called the “father of gods and men,” whose power it was impossible to\r\nresist, and which power was universal. He was supposed to be the\r\nsuperintending providence, whose seat was on Mount Olympus, enthroned in\r\nmajesty and might, to whom the lesser deities were obedient. With his two\r\nbrothers, Poseidon, or Neptune, and Hades, or Pluto, he reigned over the\r\nheavens, the earth, the sea, and hell. Mythology represents him as born in\r\nCrete; and when he had gained sufficient mental and bodily force, he\r\nsummoned the gods to Mount Olympus, and resolved to wrest the supreme\r\npower from his father, Kronos, and the Titans. Ten years were spent in the\r\nmighty combat, in which all nature was convulsed, before victory was\r\nobtained, and the Titans hurled into Tartarus. With Zeus now began a\r\ndifferent order of beings. He is represented as having many wives and a\r\nnumerous offspring. From his own head came Athene, fully armed, the\r\ngoddess of wisdom, the patron deity of Athens. By Themis he begat the\r\nHoræ; by Eurynome, the three Graces; by Mnemosyne, the Muses; by Leto\r\n(Latona), Apollo, and Artemis (Diana); by Demeter (Ceres), Persephone; by\r\nHere (Juno), Hebe, Ares (Mars), and Eileithyia; by Maia, Hermes (Mercury).\r\n\r\n(M318) Under the presidency of Zeus were the twelve great gods and\r\ngoddesses of Olympus—Poseidon (Neptune), who presided over the sea;\r\nApollo, who was the patron of art; Ares, the god of war; Hephaestos\r\n(Vulcan), who forged the thunderbolts; Hermes, who was the messenger of\r\nomnipotence and the protector of merchants; Here, the queen of heaven, and\r\ngeneral protector of the female sex; Athene (Minerva), the goddess of\r\nwisdom and letters; Artemis (Diana), the protectress of hunters and\r\nshepherds; Aphrodite (Venus), the goddess of beauty and love; Hertia\r\n(Vesta), the goddess of the hearth and altar, whose fire never went out;\r\nDemeter (Ceres), mother earth, the goddess of agriculture.\r\n\r\nScarcely inferior to these Olympian deities were Hades (Pluto), who\r\npresided over the infernal regions; Helios, the sun; Hecate, the goddess\r\nof expiation; Dionysus (Bacchus), the god of the vine; Leto (Latona), the\r\ngoddess of the concealed powers; Eos (Aurora), goddess of the morn;\r\nNemesis, god of vengeance; Æolus, the god of winds; Harmonia; the Graces,\r\nthe Muses, the Nymphs, the Nereids, marine nymphs—these were all invested\r\nwith great power and dignity.\r\n\r\nBesides these were deities who performed special services to the greater\r\ngods, like the Horæ; and monsters, offspring of gods, like the gorgons,\r\nchimera, the dragon of the Hesperides, the Lernæan hydra, the Nemean lion,\r\nScylla and Charybdis, the centaurs, the sphinx, and others.\r\n\r\n(M319) It will be seen that these gods and goddesses represent the powers\r\nof nature, and the great attributes of wisdom, purity, courage, fidelity,\r\ntruth, which belong to man’s higher nature, and which are associated with\r\nthe divine. It was these powers and attributes which were\r\nworshiped—superhuman and adorable. Homer and Hesiod are the great\r\nauthorities of the theogonies of the pagan world, and we can not tell how\r\nmuch of this was of their invention, and how much was implanted in the\r\ncommon mind of the Greeks, at an age earlier than 700 B.C. The Orphic\r\ntheogony belongs to a later date, but acquired even greater popular\r\nveneration than the Hesiodic.\r\n\r\n(M320) The worship of these divinities was attended by rites more or less\r\nelevated, but sometimes by impurities and follies, like those of Bacchus\r\nand Venus. Sometimes this worship was veiled in mysteries, like those of\r\nEleusis. To all these deities temples were erected, and offerings made,\r\nsometimes of fruits and flowers, and then of animals. Of all these deities\r\nthere were legends—sometimes absurd, and these were interwoven with\r\nliterature and religious solemnities. The details of these fill many a\r\nlarge dictionary, and are to be read in dictionaries, or in poems. Those\r\nwhich pertain to Ceres, to Apollo, to Juno, to Venus, to Minerva, to\r\nMercury, are full of poetic beauty and fascination. They arose in an age\r\nof fertile imagination and ardent feeling, and became the faith of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n(M321) Besides the legends pertaining to gods and goddesses, are those\r\nwhich relate the heroic actions of men. Grote describes the different\r\nraces of men as they appear in the Hesiodic theogony—the offspring of\r\ngods. First, the golden race: first created, good and happy, like the gods\r\nthemselves, and honored after death by being made the unseen guardians of\r\nmen—“terrestrial demons.” Second, the silver race, inferior in body and\r\nmind, was next created, and being disobedient, are buried in the earth.\r\nThird, the brazen race, hard, pugnacious, terrible, strong, which was\r\ncontinually at war, and ultimately destroyed itself, and descended into\r\nHades, unhonored and without privilege. Fourth, the race of heroes, or\r\ndemigods, such as fought at Thebes and Troy, virtuous but warlike, which\r\nalso perished in battle, but were removed to a happier state. And finally,\r\nthe iron race, doomed to perpetual guilt, care, toil, suffering—unjust,\r\ndishonest, ungrateful, thoughtless—such is the present race of men, with a\r\nsmall admixture of good, which will also end in due time. Such are the\r\nraces which Hesiod describes in his poem of the “Works and\r\nDays,”—penetrated with a profound sense of the wickedness and degeneracy\r\nof human life, yet of the ultimate rewards of virtue and truth. His demons\r\nare not gods, nor men, but intermediate agents, essentially good—angels,\r\nwhose province was to guard and to benefit the world. But the notions of\r\ndemons gradually changed, until they were regarded as both good and bad,\r\nas viewed by Plato, and finally they were regarded as the causes of evil,\r\nas in the time of the Christian writers. Hesiod, who lived, it is\r\nsupposed, four hundred years before Herodotus, is a great ethical poet,\r\nand embodied the views of his age respecting the great mysteries of nature\r\nand life.\r\n\r\nThe legends which Hesiod, Homer, and other poets made so attractive by\r\ntheir genius, have a perpetual interest, since they are invested with all\r\nthe fascinations of song and romance. We will not enter upon those which\r\nrelate to gods, but confine ourselves to those which relate to men—the\r\nearly heroes of the classic land and age; nor can we allude to all—only a\r\nfew—those which are most memorable and impressive.\r\n\r\n(M322) Among the most ancient was the legend relating to the Danaides,\r\nwhich invest the early history of Argos with peculiar interest. Inachus,\r\nwho reigned 1986 B.C., according to ancient chronology, is also the name\r\nof the river flowing beneath the walls of the ancient city, situated in\r\nthe eastern part of the Peloponnesus. In the reign of Krotopos, one of his\r\ndescendants, Danaus came with his fifty daughters from Egypt to Argos in a\r\nvessel of fifty oars, in order to escape the solicitations of the fifty\r\nsons of Ægyptos, his brother, who wished to make them their wives. Ægyptos\r\nand the sons followed in pursuit, and Danaus was compelled to assent to\r\ntheir desires, but furnished each of his daughters with a dagger, on the\r\nwedding night, who thus slew their husbands, except one, whose husband,\r\nLynceus, ultimately became king of Argos. From Danaus was derived the name\r\nof Danai, applied to the people of the Argeian territory, and to the\r\nHomeric Greeks generally. We hence infer that Argos—one of the oldest\r\ncities of Greece, was settled in part by Egyptians, probably in the era of\r\nthe shepherd kings, who introduced not only the arts, but the religious\r\nrites of that ancient country. Among the regal descendants of Lynceus was\r\nDanae, whose son Perseus performed marvelous deeds, by the special favor\r\nof Athene, among which he brought from Libya the terrific head of the\r\nGorgon Medusa, which had the marvelous property of turning every one to\r\nstone who looked at her. Stung with remorse for the accidental murder of\r\nhis grandfather, the king, he retired from Argos, and founded the city of\r\nMycenæ, the ruins of whose massive walls are still to be seen—Cyclopean\r\nworks, which seem to show that the old Pelasgians derived their\r\narchitectural ideas from the Egyptian Danauns. The Perseids of Mycenæ thus\r\nboasted of an illustrious descent, which continued down to the last\r\nsovereign of Sparta.\r\n\r\n(M323) The grand-daughter of Perseus was Alcmena, whom mythology\r\nrepresents as the mother of Hercules by Jupiter. The labors of Hercules\r\nare among the most interesting legends of pagan antiquity, since they are\r\ntypes of the endless toils of a noble soul, doomed to labor for others,\r\nand obey the commands of worthless persecutors. But the hero is finally\r\nrewarded by admission to the family of the gods, and his descendants are\r\nultimately restored to the inheritance from which they were deprived by\r\nthe wrath and jealousy of Juno. A younger branch of the Perseid family\r\nreigned in Lacedæmon—Eurystheus, to whom Hercules was subject; but he,\r\nwith all his sons, lost their lives in battle, so that the Perseid family\r\nwas represented only by the sons of Hercules—the Heracleids, or Heraclidæ.\r\nThey endeavored to regain their possessions, and invaded the Peloponnesus,\r\nfrom which they had been expelled. Hyllos, the oldest son, proposed to the\r\narmy of Ionians, Achæans, and Arcadians, which met them in defense, that\r\nthe combat should be decided between himself and any champion of the\r\ninvading army, and that, if he were victorious, the Heracleids should be\r\nrestored to their sovereignty, but if defeated, should forego their claim\r\nfor three generations. Hyllos was vanquished, and the Heracleids retired\r\nand resided with the Dorians. When the stipulated period had ended, they,\r\nassisted by the Dorians, gained possession of the Peloponnesus. Hence the\r\ngreat Dorian settlement of Argos, Sparta, and Messenia, effected by the\r\nreturn of the Heracleids.\r\n\r\n(M324) Another important legend is that which relates to Deucalion and the\r\ndeluge, as it is supposed to shed light on the different races that\r\ncolonized Greece. The wickedness of the world induced Zeus to punish it by\r\na deluge; a terrible rain laid the whole of Greece under water, except a\r\nfew mountain tops. Deucalion was saved in an ark, or chest, which he had\r\nbeen forewarned to construct. After floating nine days, he landed on the\r\nsummit of Mount Parnassus. Issuing from his ark, he found no inhabitants,\r\nthey having been destroyed by the deluge. Instructed, however, by Zeus, he\r\nand his wife, Pyrrha, threw stones over their heads, and those which he\r\nthrew became men, and those thrown by his wife became women. Thus does\r\nmythology account for the new settlement of the country—a tradition\r\ndoubtless derived from the remote ages through the children of Japhet,\r\nfrom whom the Greeks descended, and who, after many wanderings and\r\nmigrations, settled in Greece.\r\n\r\n(M325) Deucalion and Pyrrha had two sons, Hellen and Amphictyon. The\r\neldest, Hellen, by a nymph was the father of Dorus, Æolus, and Xuthus, and\r\nhe gave his name to the nation—Hellenas. In dividing the country among his\r\nsons, Æolus received Thessaly; Xuthus, Peloponnesus; and Dorus, the\r\ncountry lying opposite, on the northern side of the Corinthian Gulf, as\r\nhas been already mentioned in the preceding chapter. Substitute Deucalion\r\nfor Noah, Greece for Armenia, and Dorus, Æolus, and Xuthus for Shem, Ham,\r\nand Japhet, and we see a reproduction of the Mosaic account of the second\r\nsettlement of mankind.\r\n\r\nAs it is natural for men to trace their origin to illustrious progenitors,\r\nso the Greeks, in their various settlements, cherished the legends which\r\nrepresented themselves as sprung from gods and heroes—those great\r\nbenefactors, whose exploits occupy the heroic ages. As Hercules was the\r\nArgine hero of the Peloponnesus, so Æolus was the father of heroes sacred\r\nin the history of the Æolians, who inhabited the largest part of Greece.\r\nÆolus reigned in Thessaly, the original seat of the Hellenes.\r\n\r\n(M326) Among his sons was Salmoneus, whose daughter, Tyro, became enamored\r\nof the river Eneipus, and frequenting its banks, the god Poseidon fell in\r\nlove with her. The fruits of this alliance were the twin brothers, Pelias\r\nand Neleus, who quarreled respecting the possession of Iolchos, situated\r\nat the foot of Mount Pelion, celebrated afterward as the residence of\r\nJason. Pelias prevailed, and Neleus returned into Peloponnesus and founded\r\nthe kingdom of Pylos. His beautiful daughter, Pero, was sought in marriage\r\nby princes from all the neighboring countries, but he refused to entertain\r\nthe pretensions of any of them, declaring that she should only wed the man\r\nwho brought him the famous oxen of Iphiklos, in Thessaly. Melampus, the\r\nnephew of Neleus, obtained the oxen for his brother Bias, who thus\r\nobtained the hand of Pero. Of the twelve sons of Neleus, Nestor was the\r\nmost celebrated. It was he who assembled the various chieftains for the\r\nsiege of Troy, and was pre-eminent over all for wisdom.\r\n\r\n(M327) Another descendant of Æolus was the subject of a beautiful legend.\r\nAdmetus, who married a daughter of Pelias, and whose horses were tended by\r\nApollo, for a time incarnated as a slave in punishment for the murder of\r\nthe Cyclopes. Apollo, in gratitude, obtained from the Fates the privilege\r\nthat the life of Admetus should be prolonged if any one could be found to\r\ndie voluntarily for him. His wife, Alkestes, made the sacrifice, but was\r\nreleased from the grasp of death (Thanatos) by Hercules, the ancient\r\nfriend of Admetus.\r\n\r\n(M328) But a still more beautiful legend is associated with Jason, a great\r\ngrandson of Æolus. Pelias, still reigning at Iolchos, was informed by the\r\noracle to beware of the man who should appear before him with only one\r\nsandal. He was celebrating a festival in honor of Poseidon when Jason\r\nappeared, having lost one of his sandals in crossing a river. As a means\r\nof averting the danger, he imposed upon Jason the task, deemed desperate,\r\nof bringing back to Iolchos the “Golden Fleece.” The result was the\r\nmemorable Argonautic expedition of the ship Argo, to the distant land of\r\nColchis, on the eastern coast of the Black Sea. Jason invited the noblest\r\nyouth of Greece to join him in this voyage of danger and glory. Fifty\r\nillustrious persons joined him, including Hercules and Theseus, Castor and\r\nPollux, Mopsus, and Orpheus. They proceeded along the coast of Thrace, up\r\nthe Hellespont, past the southern coast of the Propontis, through the\r\nBosphorus, onward past Bithynia and Pontus, and arrived at the river\r\nPhasis, south of the Caucasian mountains, where dwelt Æetes, whom they\r\nsought. But he refused to surrender the golden fleece except on conditions\r\nwhich were almost impossible. Medea, however, his daughter, fell in love\r\nwith Jason, and by her means, assisted by Hecate, he succeeded in yoking\r\nthe ferocious bulls and plowing the field, and sowing it with dragons’\r\nteeth. Still Æetes refused the reward, and meditated the murder of the\r\nArgonauts; but Medea lulled to sleep the dragon which guarded the fleece,\r\nand fled with her lover and his companions on board the Argo. The\r\nadventurers returned to Iolchos in safety, after innumerable perils, and\r\nby courses irreconcilable with all geographical truths. But Jason could\r\navenge himself on Pelias only through the stratagem of his wife, and by\r\nher magical arts she induced the daughters of Pelias to cut up their\r\nfather, and to cast his limbs into a cauldron, believing that by this\r\nmethod he would be restored to the vigor of youth, and Jason was thus\r\nrevenged, and obtained possession of the kingdom, which he surrendered to\r\na son of Pelias, and retired with his wife to Corinth. Here he lived ten\r\nyears in prosperity, but repudiated Medea in order to marry Glance, the\r\ndaughter of the king of Corinth; Medea avenged the insult by the poisoned\r\nrobe she sent to Glance as a marriage present, while Jason perished, while\r\nasleep, from a fragment of his ship Argo, which fell upon him. Such is the\r\nlegend of the Argonauts, which is typical of the naval adventures of the\r\nmaritime Greeks, and their restless enterprises.\r\n\r\n(M329) The legend of Sisyphus is connected with the early history of\r\nCorinth. Sisyphus was the son of Æolus, and founded this wealthy city. He\r\nwas distinguished for cunning and deceit. He detected Antolycus, the son\r\nof Hermes, by marking his sheep under the foot, so that the arch-thief was\r\nobliged to acknowledge the superior craft of the Æolid, and restore the\r\nplunder. He discovered the amour of Zeus with the nymph Ægina, and told\r\nher mother where she was carried, which so incensed the “father of gods\r\nand men,” that he doomed Sisyphus, in Hades, to the perpetual punishment\r\nof rolling up a hill a heavy stone, which, as soon as it reached the\r\nsummit, rolled back again in spite of all his efforts. This legend\r\nillustrates the never ending toils and disappointments of men.\r\n\r\n(M330) Sisyphus was the grandfather of Bellerophon, whose beauty made him\r\nthe object of a violent passion on the part of Antea, the wife of a king\r\nof Argos. He rejected her advances, and became as violently hated. She\r\nmade false accusations, and persuaded her husband to kill him. Not wishing\r\nto commit the murder directly, he sent him to his son-in-law, the king of\r\nSykia, in Asia Minor, with a folded tablet full of destructive symbols,\r\nwhich required him to perform perilous undertakings, which he successfully\r\nperformed. He was then recognized as the son of a god, and married the\r\ndaughter of the king. This legend reminds us of Joseph in Egypt.\r\n\r\n(M331) We are compelled to omit other interesting legends of the Æolids,\r\nthe sons and daughters of Æolus, among which are those which record the\r\nfeats of Atalanta, and turn to those which relate to the Pelopids, who\r\ngave to the Peloponnesus its early poetic interest. Of this remarkable\r\nrace were Tantalus, Pelops, Atreus, Thyestes, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Helen,\r\nand Hermione, all of whom figured in the ancient legendary genealogies.\r\n\r\n(M332) Tantalus resided, at a remote antiquity, near Mount Sipylus, in\r\nLydia, and was a man of immense wealth, and pre-eminently favored both by\r\ngods and men. Intoxicated by prosperity, he stole nectar and ambrosia from\r\nthe table of the gods, and revealed their secrets, for which he was\r\npunished in the under world by perpetual hunger and thirst, yet placed\r\nwith fruit and water near him, which eluded his grasp when he attempted to\r\ntouch them. He had two children, Pelops and Niobe. The latter was blessed\r\nwith seven sons and seven daughters, which so inflamed her with pride that\r\nshe claimed equality with the goddesses Latona and Diana, who favored her\r\nby their friendship. This presumption so incensed the goddesses, that they\r\nkilled all her children, and Niobe wept herself to death, and was turned\r\ninto a stone, a striking image of excessive grief.\r\n\r\n(M333) Pelops was a Lydian king, but was expelled from Asia by Ilus, king\r\nof Troy, for his impieties. He came to Greece, and beat Hippodamenia,\r\nwhose father was king of Pisa, near Olympia, in Elis, in a chariot race,\r\nwhen death was the penalty of failure. He succeeded by the favor of\r\nPoseidon, and married the princess, and became king of Pisa. He gave his\r\nname to the whole peninsula, which he was enabled to do from the great\r\nwealth he brought from Lydia, thus connecting the early settlements of the\r\nPeloponnesus with Asia Minor. He had numerous children, who became the\r\nsovereigns of different cities and states in Argos, Elis, Laconia, and\r\nArcadia. One of them, Atreus, was king of Mycenæ, who inherited the\r\nsceptre of Zeus, and whose wealth was proverbial. The sceptre was made by\r\nHephæstus (Vulcan) and given to Zeus; he gave it to Hermes; Hermes\r\npresented it to Pelops; and Pelops gave it to Atreus, the ruler of men.\r\nAtreus and his brother, Thyestes, bequeathed it to Agamemnon, who ruled at\r\nMycenæ, while his brother, Menelaus, reigned at Sparta. It was the wife of\r\nMenelaus, Helen, who was carried away by Paris, which occasioned the\r\nTrojan war. Agamemnon was killed on his return from Troy, through the\r\ntreachery of his wife Clytemnestra, who was seduced by Ægisthus, the son\r\nof Thyestes. His only son, Orestes, afterward avenged the murder, and\r\nrecovered Mycenæ. Hermione, the only daughter of Menelaus and Helen, was\r\ngiven in marriage to the son of Achilles, Neoptolemas, who reigned in\r\nThessaly. Mycenæ maintained its independence to the Persian invasion, and\r\nis rendered immortal by the Iliad and Odyssey. On the subsequent\r\nascendency of Sparta, the bones of Orestes were brought from Tegea, where\r\nthey had reposed for generations, in a coffin seven cubits long.\r\n\r\nThe other States of the Peloponnesus, have also their genealogical\r\nlegends, which trace their ancestors to gods and goddesses, which I omit,\r\nand turn to those which belong to Attica.\r\n\r\n(M334) The great Deucalian deluge, according to legend, happened during\r\nthe reign of Ogyges, 1796 years B.C., and 1020 before the first Olympiad.\r\nAfter a long interval, Cecrops, half man and half serpent, became king of\r\nthe country. By some he is represented as a Pelasgian, by others, as an\r\nEgyptian. He introduced the first elements of civilized life—marriage, the\r\ntwelve political divisions of Attica, and a new form of worship,\r\nabolishing the bloody sacrifices to Zeus. He gave to the country the name\r\nof Cecropia. During his reign there ensued a dispute between Athenæ and\r\nPoseidon, respecting the possession of the Acropolis. Poseidon struck the\r\nrocks with his trident, and produced a well of salt water; Athenæ planted\r\nan olive tree. The twelve Olympian gods decided the dispute, and awarded\r\nto Athenæ the coveted possession, and she ever afterward remained the\r\nprotecting deity of Athens.\r\n\r\n(M335) Among his descendants was Theseus, the great legendary hero of\r\nAttica, who was one of the Argonauts, and also one of those who hunted the\r\nCalidomian boar. He freed Attica from robbers and wild beasts, conquered\r\nthe celebrated Minotaur of Crete, and escaped from the labyrinth by the\r\naid of Ariadne, whom he carried off and abandoned. In the Iliad he is\r\nrepresented as fighting against the centaurs, and in the Hesiodic poems he\r\nis an amorous knight-errant, misguided by the beautiful Ægle. Among his\r\nother feats, inferior only to those of Hercules, he vanquished the\r\nAmazons—a nation of courageous and hardy women, who came from the country\r\nabout Caucasus, and whose principal seats were near the modern Trezibond.\r\nThey invaded Thrace, Asia Minor, Greece, Syria, Egypt, and the islands of\r\nthe Ægean. The foundation of several towns in Asia Minor is ascribed to\r\nthem. In the time of Theseus, this semi-mythical and semi-historical race\r\nof female warriors invaded Attica, and even penetrated to Athens, but were\r\nconquered by the hero king. Allusion is made to their defeat throughout\r\nthe literature of Athens. Although Theseus was a purely legendary\r\npersonage, the Athenians were accustomed to regard him as a great\r\npolitical reformer and legislator, who consolidated the Athenian\r\ncommonwealth, distributing the people into three classes.\r\n\r\n(M336) The legends pertaining to Thebes occupy a prominent place in\r\nGrecian mythology. Cadmus, the son of Agenor, king of Phœnicia, leaves his\r\ncountry in search of his sister Europa, with whom Zeus, in the form of a\r\nbull, had fallen in love, and carried on his back to Crete. He first goes\r\nto Thrace, and thence to Delphi, to learn tidings of Europa, but the god\r\ndirects him not to prosecute his search; he is to follow the guidance of a\r\ncow, and to found a city where the animal should lie down. The cow stops\r\nat the site of Thebes. He marries Harmonia, the daughter of Ares and\r\nAphrodite, after having killed the dragons which guarded the fountain\r\nAllia, and sowed their teeth. From these armed men sprang up, who killed\r\neach other, except five. From these arose the five great families of\r\nThebes, called Sparti. One of the Sparti marries a daughter of Cadmus,\r\nwhose issue was Pentheus, who became king. It was in his reign that\r\nDionysus appears as a god in Bœotia, the giver of the vine, and obtains\r\ndivine honors in Thebes. Among the descendants of Cadmus was Laius. He is\r\nforewarned by an oracle that any son he should beget would destroy him,\r\nand hence he caused the infant Œdipus to be exposed on Mount Cithanon.\r\nHere the herdsmen of Polybus, king of Corinth, find him, and convey him to\r\ntheir lord who brings him up as his own child. Distressed by the taunts of\r\ncompanions as to his unknown parentage, he goes to Delphi, to inquire the\r\nname of his real father. He is told not to return to his own country, for\r\nit was his destiny to kill his father and become the husband of his\r\nmother. Knowing no country but Corinth, he pursues his way to Bœotia, and\r\nmeets Laius in a chariot drawn by mules. A quarrel ensues from the\r\ninsolence of attendants, and Œdipus kills Laius. The brother of Laius,\r\nCreon, succeeds to the throne of Thebes. The country around is vexed with\r\na terrible monster, with the face of a woman, the wings of a bird, and the\r\ntail of a lion, called the Sphinx, who has learned from the Muses a\r\nriddle, which she proposed to the Thebans, and on every failure to resolve\r\nit one of them was devoured. But no person can solve the riddle. The king\r\noffers his crown and his sister Jocasta, wife of Laius, in marriage to any\r\none who would explain the riddle. Œdipus solves it, and is made king of\r\nThebes, and marries Jocasta. A fatal curse rests upon him. Jocasta,\r\ninformed by the gods of her relationship, hangs herself in agony. Œdipus\r\nendures great miseries, as well as his children, whom he curses, and who\r\nquarrel about their inheritance, which quarrel leads to the siege of\r\nThebes by Adrastus, king of Argos, who seeks to restore Polynices—one of\r\nthe sons of Œdipus, to the throne of which he was dispossessed. The\r\nArgetan chieftains readily enter into the enterprise, assisted by numerous\r\nauxiliaries from Arcadia and Messenia. The Cadmeans, assisted by the\r\nPhocians, march out to resist the invaders, who are repulsed, in\r\nconsequence of the magnanimity of a generous youth, who offers himself a\r\nvictim to Ares. Eteocles then proposed to his brother, Polynices, the\r\nrival claimants, to decide the quarrel by single combat. It resulted in\r\nthe death of both, and then in the renewal of the general contest, and the\r\ndestruction of the Argeian chiefs, and Adrastus’s return to Argos in shame\r\nand woe.\r\n\r\n(M337) But Creon, the father of the self-sacrificing Menæceus, succeeds on\r\nthe death of the rival brothers, to the administration of Thebes. A second\r\nsiege takes place, conducted by Adrastus, and the sons of those who had\r\nbeen slain. Thebes now falls, and Thereander, the son of Polynices, is\r\nmade king. The legends of Thebes have furnished the great tragedians\r\nSophocles and Euripides, with their finest subjects. In the fable of the\r\nSphinx we trace a connection between Thebes and ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nBut all the legends of ancient Greece yield in interest to that of Troy,\r\nwhich Homer chose as the subject of his immortal epic.\r\n\r\n(M338) Dardanus, a son of Zeus, is the primitive ancestor of the Trojan\r\nkings, whose seat of power was Mount Ida. His son, Erichthonius, became\r\nthe richest of mankind, and had in his pastures three thousand mares. His\r\nson, Tros, was the father of Ilus, Assarcus, and Ganymede. The latter was\r\nstolen by Zeus to be his cup-bearer.\r\n\r\n(M339) Ilus was the father of Laomedon, under whom Apollo and Poseidon, in\r\nmortal form, went through a temporary servitude—the former tending his\r\nflocks, the latter building the walls of Ilium. Laomedon was killed by\r\nHercules, in punishment for his perfidy in giving him mortal horses for\r\nhis destruction of a sea monster, instead of the immortal horses, as he\r\nhad promised, the gift of Zeus to Tros.\r\n\r\n(M340) Among the sons of Laomedon was Priam, who was placed upon the\r\nthrone. He was the father of illustrious sons, among whom were Hector and\r\nParis. The latter was exposed on Mount Ida, to avoid the fulfillment of an\r\nevil prophecy, but grew up beautiful and active among the flocks and\r\nherds. It was to him that the three goddesses, Here, Athenæ, and Aphrodite\r\n(Juno, Minerva, and Venus), presented their respective claims to beauty,\r\nwhich he awarded to Aphrodite, and by whom he was promised, in recompense,\r\nHelen, wife of the Spartan king, Menelaus, and daughter of Zeus. Aphrodite\r\ncaused ships to be built for him, and he safely arrived in Sparta, and was\r\nhospitably entertained by the unsuspecting monarch. In the absence of\r\nMenelaus in Crete, Paris carries away to Troy both Helen, and a large sum\r\nof money belonging to the king. Menelaus hastens home, informed of the\r\nperfidy, and consults his brother, Agamemnon, and the venerable Nestor.\r\nThey interest the Argeian chieftains, who resolve to recover Helen. Ten\r\nyears are spent in preparations, consisting of one thousand one hundred\r\nand eighty-six ships, and one hundred thousand men, comprised of heroes\r\nfrom all parts of Greece, among whom are Ajax, Diomedes, Achilles, and\r\nOdysseus. The heroes set sail from Aulis, and after various mistakes,\r\nreach Asia.\r\n\r\n(M341) Meanwhile the Trojans assemble, with a large body of allies, to\r\nresist the invaders, who demand the redress of a great wrong. The Trojans\r\nare routed in battle, and return within their walls. After various\r\nfortunes, the city is taken, at the end of ten years, by stratagem, and\r\nthe Grecian chieftains who were not killed seek to return to their own\r\ncountry, with Helen among the spoils. They meet with many misfortunes,\r\nfrom the anger of the gods, for not having spared the altars of Troy.\r\nTheir chieftains quarrel among themselves, and even Agamemnon and Menelaus\r\nlose their fraternal friendship. After long wanderings, and bitter\r\ndisappointments, and protracted hopes, the heroes return to their\r\nhomes—such as war had spared—to recount their adventures and sufferings,\r\nand reconstruct their shattered States, and mend their broken fortunes—a\r\ntype of war in all the ages, calamitous even to conquerors. The wanderings\r\nof Ulysses have a peculiar fascination, since they form the subject of the\r\nOdyssey, one of the noblest poems of antiquity. Nor are the adventures of\r\nÆneas scarcely less interesting, as presented by Virgil, who traces the\r\nfirst Settlement of Latium to the Trojan exiles. We should like to dwell\r\non the siege of Troy, and its great results, but the subject is too\r\nextensive and complicated. The student of the great event, whether\r\nhistorical or mystical, must read the detailed accounts in the immortal\r\nepics of Homer. We have only space for the grand outlines, which can be\r\nscarcely more than allusions.\r\n\r\n(M342) Scarcely inferior to the legend of Troy, is that which recounts the\r\nreturn of the descendants of Hercules to the ancient inheritance on the\r\nPeloponnesus, which, it is supposed, took place three or four hundred\r\nyears before authentic history begins, or eighty years after the Trojan\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nWe have briefly described the geographical position of the most important\r\npart of ancient Greece—the Peloponnesus—almost an island, separated from\r\nthe continent only by a narrow gulf, resembling in shape a palm-tree,\r\nindented on all sides by bays, and intersected with mountains, and\r\ninhabited by a simple and warlike race.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the descendants of Perseus, who was a descendant of\r\nDanaus, reigned at Mycenæ in Argolis—among whom was Amphitryon, who fled\r\nto Thebes, on the murder of his uncle, with Alemena his wife. Then\r\nHercules, to whom the throne of Mycenæ legitimately belonged, was born,\r\nbut deprived of his inheritance by Eurystheus—a younger branch of the\r\nPerseids—in consequence of the anger and jealousy of Juno, and to whom, by\r\nthe fates, Hercules was made subject. We have seen how the sons of\r\nHercules, under Hyllos, attempted to regain their kingdom, but were\r\ndefeated, and retreated among the Dorians.\r\n\r\n(M343) After three generations, the Heraclidæ set out to regain their\r\ninheritance, assisted by the Dorians. They at length, after five\r\nexpeditions, gained possession of the country, and divided it, among the\r\nvarious chieftains, who established their dominion in Argos, Mycenæ, and\r\nSparta, which, at the time of the Trojan war, was ruled by Agamemnon and\r\nMenelaus, descendants of Pelops. In the next generation, Corinth was\r\nconquered by the Dorians, under an Heraclide prince.\r\n\r\n(M344) The Achæans, thus expelled by the Dorians from the south and east\r\nof the Peloponnesus, fell back upon the northwest coast, and drove away\r\nthe Ionians, and formed a confederacy of twelve cities, which in later\r\ntimes became of considerable importance. The dispossessed Ionians joined\r\ntheir brethren of the same race in Attica, but the rugged peninsula was\r\nunequal to support the increased population, and a great migration took\r\nplace to the Cyclades and the coasts of Lydia. The colonists there built\r\ntwelve cities, about one hundred and forty years after the Trojan war.\r\nAnother body of Achæans, driven out of the Peloponnesus by the Dorians,\r\nfirst settled in Bœotia, and afterward, with Æolians, sailed to the isle\r\nof Lesbos, where they founded six cities, and then to the opposite\r\nmainland. At the foot of Mount Ida they founded the twelve Æolian cities,\r\nof which Smyrna was the principal.\r\n\r\n(M345) Crete was founded by a body of Dorians and conquered Achæans.\r\nRhodes received a similar colony. So did the island of Cos. The cities of\r\nLindus, Ialysus, Camirus, Cos, with Cnidus and Halicarnassus, on the\r\nmainland, formed the Dorian Hexapolis of Caria, inferior, however, to the\r\nIonian and Æolian colonies.\r\n\r\n(M346) At the beginning of the mythical age the dominant Hellenic races\r\nwere the Achæans and Æolians; at the close, the Ionians and Dorians were\r\npredominant. The Ionians extended their maritime possessions from Attica\r\nto the Asiatic colonies across the Ægean, and gradually took the lead of\r\nthe Asiatic Æolians, and formed a great maritime empire under the\r\nsupremacy of Athens. The Hellenic world ultimately was divided and\r\nconvulsed by the great contest for supremacy between the Dorians and\r\nIonians, until the common danger from the Persian invasion united them\r\ntogether for a time.\r\n\r\n(M347) Thus far we have only legend to guide us in the early history of\r\nGreece. The historical period begins with the First Olympiad, B.C. 776.\r\nBefore this all is uncertain, yet as probable as the events of English\r\nhistory in the mythical period between the departure of the Romans and the\r\nestablishment of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The history is not all myth;\r\nneither is it clearly authenticated.\r\n\r\n(M348) The various Hellenic tribes, though separated by political\r\nambition, were yet kindred in language and institutions. They formed great\r\nleagues, or associations, of neighboring cities, for the performance of\r\nreligious rites. The Amphictyonic Council, which became subsequently so\r\nfamous, was made up of Thessalians, Bœotians, Dorians, Ionians, Achæans,\r\nLocrians, and Phocians—all Hellenic in race. Their great centre was the\r\ntemple of Apollo at Delphi. The different tribes or nations also came\r\ntogether regularly to take part in the four great religious festivals or\r\ngames—the Olympic, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemæan—the two former of which\r\nwere celebrated every four years.\r\n\r\n(M349) In the Homeric age the dominant State was Achæa, whose capital was\r\nMycenæ. The next in power was Lacedæmon. After the Dorian conquest, Argos\r\nwas the first, Sparta the second, and Messenia the third State in\r\nimportance. Argos, at the head of a large confederacy of cities on the\r\nnortheast of the Peloponnesus, was governed by Phidon—an irresponsible\r\nruler, a descendant of Hercules, to whom is inscribed the coinage of\r\nsilver and copper money, and the introduction of weights and measures. He\r\nflourished B.C. 747.\r\n\r\n(M350) All these various legends, though unsupported by history, have a\r\ngreat ethical importance, as well as poetic interest. The passions,\r\nhabits, and adventures of a primitive and warlike race are presented by\r\nthe poets with transcendent effect, and we read lessons of human nature as\r\nin the dramas of Shakespeare. Hence, one of the most learned and dignified\r\nof the English historians deems it worthy of his pen to devote to these\r\nmyths a volume of his noble work. Nor is it misplaced labor. These legends\r\nfurnished subjects to the tragic and epic poets of antiquity, as well as\r\nto painters and sculptors, in all the ages of art. They are identified\r\nwith the development of Grecian genius, and are as imperishable as history\r\nitself. They were to the Greeks realities, and represent all that is vital\r\nin their associations and worship. They stimulated the poetic faculty, and\r\ntaught lessons of moral wisdom which all nations respect and venerate.\r\nThey contributed to enrich both literature and art. They make Æschylus,\r\nEuripides, Pindar, Homer, and Hesiod great monumental pillars of the\r\nprogress of the human race. Therefore, we will not willingly let those\r\nlegends die in our memories or hearts.\r\n\r\n(M351) They are particularly important as shedding light on the manners,\r\ncustoms, and institutions of the ancient Greeks, although they give no\r\nreliable historical facts. They are memorials of the first state of\r\nGrecian society, essentially different from the Oriental world. We see in\r\nthem the germs of political constitutions—the rise of liberty—the\r\npre-eminence of families which forms the foundation for oligarchy, or the\r\nascendency of nobles. We see also the first beginnings of democratic\r\ninfluence—the voice of the people asserting a claim to be heard in the\r\nmarket-place. We see again the existence of slavery—captives taken in war\r\ndoomed to attendance in princely palaces, and ultimately to menial labor\r\non the land. In those primitive times a State was often nothing but a\r\ncity, with the lands surrounding it, and therefore it was possible for all\r\nthe inhabitants to assemble in the agora with the king and nobles. We\r\nfind, in the early condition of Greece, kings, nobles, citizens, and\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n(M352) The king was seldom distinguished by any impassable barrier between\r\nhimself and subjects. He was rather the chief among his nobles, and his\r\nsupremacy was based on descent from illustrious ancestors. It passed\r\ngenerally to the eldest son. In war he was a leader; in peace, a\r\nprotector. He offered up prayers and sacrifices for his people to the gods\r\nin whom they all alike believed. He possessed an ample domain, and the\r\nproduce of his lands was devoted to a generous but rude hospitality. He\r\nhad a large share of the plunder taken from an enemy, and the most\r\nalluring of the female captives. It was, however, difficult for him to\r\nretain ascendency without great personal gifts and virtues, and especially\r\nbravery on the field of battle, and wisdom in council. To the noblest of\r\nthese kings the legends ascribe great bodily strength and activity.\r\n\r\n(M353) The kings were assisted by a great council of chieftains or nobles,\r\nwhose functions were deliberation and consultation; and after having\r\ntalked over their intentions with the chiefs, they announced them to the\r\npeople, who assembled in the market-place, and who were generally\r\nsubmissive to the royal authority, although they were regarded as the\r\nsource of power. Then the king, and sometimes his nobles, administered\r\njustice and heard complaints. Public speaking was favorable to eloquence,\r\nand stimulated intellectual development, and gave dignity to tho people to\r\nwhom the speeches were addressed.\r\n\r\n(M354) In those primitive times there was a strong religious feeling,\r\ngreat reverence for the gods, whose anger was deprecated, and whose favor\r\nwas sought. The ties of families were strong. Paternal authority was\r\nrecognized and revered. Marriage was a sacred institution. The wife\r\noccupied a position of great dignity and influence. Women were not\r\nsecluded in a harem, as were the Asiatics, but employed in useful labors.\r\nChildren were obedient, and brothers, sisters, and cousins were united\r\ntogether by strong attachments. Hospitality was a cherished virtue, and\r\nthe stranger was ever cordially welcome, nor questioned even until\r\nrefreshed by the bath and the banquet. Feasts were free from extravagance\r\nand luxury, and those who shared in them enlivened the company by a\r\nrecital of the adventures of gods and men. But passions were unrestrained,\r\nand homicide was common. The murderer was not punished by the State, but\r\nwas left to the vengeance of kindred and friends, appeased sometimes by\r\ncostly gifts, as among the ancient Jews.\r\n\r\n(M355) There was a rude civilization among the ancient Greeks, reminding\r\nus of the Teutonic tribes, but it was higher than theirs. We observe the\r\ndivision of the people into various trades and occupations—carpenters,\r\nsmiths, leather-dressers, leeches, prophets, bards, and fishermen,\r\nalthough the main business was agriculture. Cattle were the great staple\r\nof wealth, and the largest part of the land was devoted to pasture. The\r\nland was tilled chiefly by slaves, and women of the servile class were\r\ndoomed to severe labor and privations. They brought the water, and they\r\nturned the mills. Spinning and weaving were, however, the occupations of\r\nall, and garments for men and women were alike made at home. There was\r\nonly a limited commerce, which was then monopolized by the Phœnicians, who\r\nexaggerated the dangers of the sea. There were walled cities, palaces, and\r\ntemples. Armor was curiously wrought, and arms were well made. Rich\r\ngarments were worn by princes, and their palaces glittered with the\r\nprecious metals. Copper was hardened so as to be employed in weapons of\r\nwar. The warriors had chariots and horses, and were armed with sword,\r\ndagger, and spear, and were protected by helmets, breastplates, and\r\ngreaves. Fortified cities were built on rocky elevations, although the\r\npeople generally lived in unfortified villages. The means of defense were\r\nsuperior to those of offense, which enabled men to preserve their\r\nacquisitions, for the ancient chieftains resembled the feudal barons of\r\nthe Middle Ages in the passion for robbery and adventure. We do not read\r\nof coined money nor the art of writing, nor sculpture, nor ornamental\r\narchitecture among the Homeric Greeks; but they were fond of music and\r\npoetry. Before history commences, they had their epics, which, sung by the\r\nbards and minstrels, furnished Homer and Hesiod with materials for their\r\nnoble productions. It is supposed by Grote that the Homeric poems were\r\ncomposed eight hundred and fifty years before Christ, and preserved two\r\nhundred years without the aid of writing—of all poems the most popular and\r\nnatural, and addressed to unlettered minds.\r\n\r\nSuch were the heroic ages with their myths, their heroes, their simple\r\nmanners, their credulity, their religious faith, their rude civilization.\r\nWe have now to trace their progress through the historical epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRECIAN STATES AND COLONIES TO THE PERSIAN WARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to consider those States which grew into importance about the\r\nmiddle of the eighth century before Christ, at the close of the legendary\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n(M356) The most important of these was Sparta, which was the leading\r\nState. We have seen how it was conquered by Dorians, under Heraclic\r\nprinces. Its first great historic name was Lycurgus, whom some historians,\r\nhowever, regard as a mythical personage.\r\n\r\n(M357) Sparta was in a state of anarchy in consequence of the Dorian\r\nconquest, a contest between the kings, aiming at absolute power, and the\r\npeople, desirous of democratic liberty. At this juncture the king,\r\nPolydectes, died, leaving Lycurgus, his brother, guardian of the realm,\r\nand of the infant heir to the throne. The future lawgiver then set out on\r\nhis travels, visiting the other States of Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt, and\r\nother countries, and returned to Sparta about the period of the first\r\nOlympiad, B.C. 776, with a rich store of wisdom and knowledge. The State\r\nwas full of disorders, but he instituted great reforms, aided by the\r\nauthority of the Delphic oracle, and a strong party of influential men.\r\nHis great object was to convert the citizens of Sparta into warriors\r\nunited by the strongest bonds, and trained to the severest discipline,\r\ngoverned by an oligarchy under the form of the ancient monarchy. In other\r\nwords, his object was to secure the ascendency of the small body of Dorian\r\ninvaders that had conquered Laconia.\r\n\r\n(M358) The descendants of these invaders, the Spartans, alone possessed\r\nthe citizenship, and were equal in political rights. They were the\r\nproprietors of the soil, which was tilled by Helots. The Spartans\r\ndisdained any occupation but war and government. They lived within their\r\ncity, which was a fortified camp, and ate in common at public tables, and\r\non the simplest fare. Every virtue and energy were concentrated on\r\nself-discipline and sacrifice, in order to fan the fires of heroism and\r\nself-devotion. They were a sort of stoics—hard, severe, proud, despotic,\r\nand overbearing. They cared nothing for literature, or art, or philosophy.\r\nEven eloquence was disdained, and the only poetry or music they cultivated\r\nwere religions hymns and heroic war songs. Commerce was forbidden by the\r\nconstitution, and all the luxuries to which it leads. Only iron was\r\nallowed for money, and the precious metals were prohibited. Every\r\nexercise, every motive, every law, contributed to make the Spartans\r\nsoldiers, and nothing but soldiers. Their discipline was the severest\r\nknown to the ancients. Their habits of life were austere and rigid. They\r\nwere trained to suffer any hardship without complaint.\r\n\r\n(M359) Besides these Spartan citizens were the _Periœci_—remnants of the\r\nold Achæan population, but mixed with an inferior class of Dorians. They\r\nhad no political power, but possessed personal freedom. They were landed\r\nproprietors, and engaged in commerce and manufactures.\r\n\r\n(M360) Below this class were the Helots—pure Greeks, but reduced to\r\ndependence by conquest. They were bound to the soil, like serfs, but dwelt\r\nwith their families on the farms they tilled. They were not bought and\r\nsold as slaves. They were the body servants of the Spartan citizens, and\r\nwere regarded as the property of the State. They were treated with great\r\nhaughtiness and injustice by their masters, which bred at last an intense\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\n(M361) All political power was in the hands of the citizen warriors, only\r\nabout nine thousand in number in the time of Lycurgus. From them emanated\r\nall delegated authority, except that of kings. This assembly, or\r\n_ecclesia_, of Spartans over thirty years of age, met at stated intervals\r\nto decide on all important matters submitted to them, but they had no\r\nright of amendment—only a simple approval or rejection.\r\n\r\n(M362) The body to which the people, it would seem, delegated considerable\r\npower, was the Senate, composed of thirty members, not under sixty years\r\nof age, and elected for life. They were a deliberative body, and judges in\r\nall capital charges against Spartans. They were not chosen for noble birth\r\nor property qualifications, but for merit and wisdom.\r\n\r\n(M363) At the head of the State, at least nominally, were two kings, who\r\nwere numbered with the thirty senators. They had scarcely more power than\r\nthe Roman consuls; they commanded the armies, and offered the public\r\nsacrifices, and were revered as the descendants of Hercules.\r\n\r\n(M364) The persons of most importance were the ephors, chosen annually by\r\nthe people, who exercised the chief executive power, and without\r\nresponsibility. They could even arrest kings, and bring them to trial\r\nbefore the Senate. Two of the five ephors accompanied the king in war, and\r\nwere a check on his authority.\r\n\r\n(M365) It would thus seem that the government of Sparta was a republic of\r\nan aristocratic type. There were no others nobler than citizens, but these\r\ncitizens composed but a small part of the population. They were Spartans—a\r\nhandful of conquerors, in the midst of hostile people—a body of lords\r\namong slaves and subjects. They sympathized with law and order, and\r\ndetested the democratical turbulence of Athens. They were trained, by\r\ntheir military education, to subordination, obedience, and self-sacrifice.\r\nThey, as citizens or as soldiers, existed only for the _State_, and to the\r\nState every thing was subordinate. In our times, the State is made for the\r\npeople; in Sparta, the people for the State. This generated an intense\r\npatriotism and self-denial. It also permitted a greater interference of\r\nthe State in personal matters than would now be tolerated in any despotism\r\nin Europe. It made the citizens submissive to a division of property,\r\nwhich if not a perfect community of goods, was fatal to all private\r\nfortunes. But the property which the citizens thus shared was virtually\r\ncreated by the Helots, who alone tilled the ground. The wealth of nations\r\nis in the earth, and it is its cultivation which is the ordinary source of\r\nproperty. The State, not individual masters, owned the Helots; and they\r\ntoiled for the citizens. In the modern sense of liberty, there was very\r\nlittle in Sparta, except that which was possessed by the aristocratic\r\ncitizens—the conquerors of the country—men, whose very occupation was war\r\nand government, and whose very amusement were those which fostered warlike\r\nhabits. The Roman citizens did not disdain husbandry, nor the Puritan\r\nsettlers of New England, but the Spartan citizens despised both this and\r\nall trade and manufacture. Never was a haughtier class of men than these\r\nSpartan soldiers. They exceeded in pride the feudal chieftain.\r\n\r\n(M366) Such an exclusive body of citizens, however, jealous of their\r\npolitical privileges, constantly declined in numbers, so that, in the time\r\nof Aristotle, there were only one thousand Spartan citizens; and this\r\ndecline continued in spite of all the laws by which the citizens were\r\ncompelled to marry, and those customs, so abhorrent to our Christian\r\nnotions, which permitted the invasion of marital rights for the sake of\r\nhealthy children.\r\n\r\n(M367) As it was to war that the best energies of the Spartans were\r\ndirected, so their armies were the admiration of the ancient world for\r\ndiscipline and effectiveness. They were the first who reduced war to a\r\nscience. The general type of their military organization was the phalanx,\r\na body of troops in close array, armed with a long spear and short sword.\r\nThe strength of an army was in the heavy armed infantry; and this body was\r\ncomposed almost entirely of citizens, with a small mixture of Periœci.\r\nFrom the age of twenty to sixty, every Spartan was liable to military\r\nservice; and all the citizens formed an army, whether congregated at\r\nSparta, or absent on foreign service.\r\n\r\nSuch, in general, were the social, civil, and military institutions of\r\nSparta, and not peculiar to her alone, but to all the Dorians, even in\r\nCrete; from which we infer that it was not Lycurgus who shaped them, but\r\nthat they existed independent of his authority. He may have re-established\r\nthe old regulations, and gave his aid to preserve the State from\r\ncorruption and decay. And when we remember that the constitution which he\r\nre-established resisted both the usurpations of tyrants and the advances\r\nof democracy, by which other States were revolutionized, we can not\r\nsufficiently admire the wisdom which so early animated the Dorian\r\nlegislators.\r\n\r\n(M368) The Spartans became masters of the country after a long struggle,\r\nand it was henceforth called Laconia. The more obstinate Achæans became\r\nHelots. After the conquest, the first memorable event in Spartan history\r\nwas the reduction of Messenia, for which it took two great wars.\r\n\r\n(M369) Messenia has already been mentioned as the southwestern part of the\r\nPeloponnesus, and resembling Laconia in its general aspects. The river\r\nParnisus flows through its entire length, as Eurotas does in Laconia,\r\nforming fertile valleys and plains, and producing various kinds of cereals\r\nand fruits, even as it now produces oil, silk, figs, wheat, maize, cotton,\r\nwine, and honey. The area of Messenia is one thousand one hundred and\r\nninety-two square miles, not so large as one of our counties. The early\r\ninhabitants had been conquered by the Dorians, and it was against the\r\ndescendants of these conquerors that the Spartans made war. The murder of\r\na Spartan king, Teleclus, at a temple on the confines of Laconia and\r\nMessenia, where sacrifices were offered in common, gave occasion for the\r\nfirst war, which lasted nineteen years, B.C. 743. Other States were\r\ninvolved in the quarrel—Corinth on the side of Sparta, and Sicyon and\r\nArcadia on the part of the Messenians. The Spartans having the superiority\r\nin the field, the Messenians retreated to their stronghold of Ithome,\r\nwhere they defended themselves fifteen years. But at last they were\r\ncompelled to abandon it, and the fortress was razed to the ground. The\r\nconquered were reduced to the condition of Helots—compelled to cultivate\r\nthe land and pay half of its produce to their new masters. The Spartan\r\ncitizens became the absolute owners of the whole soil of Messenia.\r\n\r\n(M370) After thirty-nine years of servitude, a hero arose among the\r\nconquered Messenians, Aristomenes, like Judas Maccabeus, or William\r\nWallace, who incited his countrymen to revolt. The whole of the\r\nPeloponnesus became involved in the new war, and only Corinth became the\r\nally of Sparta; the remaining States of Argos, Sicyon, Arcadia, and Pisa,\r\nsided with the Messenians. The Athenian poet, Tyrtæus, stimulated the\r\nSpartans by his war-songs. In the first great battle, the Spartans were\r\nworsted; in the second, they gained a signal victory, so that the\r\nMessenians were obliged to leave the open country and retire to the\r\nfortress on Mount Ira. Here they maintained themselves eleven years, the\r\nSpartans being unused to sieges, and trained only to conflict in the open\r\nfield. The fortress was finally taken by treachery, and the hero who\r\nsought to revive the martial glories of his State fled to Rhodes. Messenia\r\nbecame now, B.C. 668, a part of Laconia, and it was three hundred years\r\nbefore it appeared again in history.\r\n\r\n(M371) The Spartans, after the conquest of Messenia, turned their eyes\r\nupon Arcadia—that land of shepherds, free and simple and brave like\r\nthemselves. The city of Tegea long withstood the arms of the Spartans, but\r\nfinally yielded to superior strength, and became a subject ally, B.C. 560.\r\nSparta was further increased by a part of Argos, and a great battle, B.C.\r\n547, between the Argives and Spartans, resulted in the complete ascendency\r\nof Sparta in the southern part of the Peloponnesus, about the time that\r\nCyrus overthrew the Lydian empire. The Ionian Greeks of Asia Minor invoked\r\ntheir aid against the Persian power, and Sparta proudly rallied in their\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\n(M372) Meanwhile, a great political revolution was going on in the other\r\nStates of Greece, in no condition to resist the pre-eminence of Sparta,\r\nThe patriarchal monarchies of the heroic ages had gradually been subverted\r\nby the rising importance of the nobility, enriched by conquered lands.\r\nEvery conquest, every step to national advancement, brought the nobles\r\nnearer to the crown, and the government passed into the hands of those\r\nnobles who had formerly composed the council of the king. With the growing\r\npower of nobles was a corresponding growth of the political power of the\r\npeople or citizens, in consequence of increased wealth and intelligence.\r\nThe political changes were rapid. As the nobles had usurped the power of\r\nthe kings, so the citizens usurped the power of the nobles. The\r\neverlasting war of classes, where the people are intelligent and free, was\r\nsignally illustrated in the Grecian States, and democracy succeeded to the\r\noligarchy which had prostrated kings. Then, when the people had gained the\r\nascendency, ambitious and factious demagogues in turn, got the control,\r\nand these adventurers, now called Tyrants, assumed arbitrary powers. Their\r\npower was only maintained by cruelty, injustice, and unscrupulous means,\r\nwhich caused them finally to be so detested that they were removed by\r\nassassination. These natural changes, from a monarchy, primitive and just\r\nand limited, to an oligarchy of nobles, and the gradual subversion of\r\ntheir power by wealthy and enlightened citizens, and then the rise of\r\ndemagogues, who became tyrants, have been illustrated in all ages of the\r\nworld. But the rapidity of these changes in the Grecian States, with the\r\nprogress of wealth and corruption, make their history impressive on all\r\ngenerations. It is these rapid and natural revolutions which give to the\r\npolitical history of Greece its permanent interest and value. The age of\r\nthe Tyrants is generally fixed from B.C. 650 to B.C. 500—about one hundred\r\nand fifty years.\r\n\r\n(M373) No State passed through these changes of government more signally\r\nthan Corinthia, which, with Megaris, formed the isthmus which connected\r\nthe Peloponnesus with Greece Proper. It was a small territory, covered\r\nwith the ridges and the spurs of the Geranean and and Oneian mountains,\r\nand useless for purposes of agriculture. Its principal city was Corinth;\r\nwas favorably situated for commerce, and rapidly grew in population and\r\nwealth. It also commanded the great roads which led from Greece Proper\r\nthrough the defiles of the mountains into the Peloponnesus. It rapidly\r\nmonopolized the commerce of the Ægean Sea, and the East through the\r\nSaronic Gulf; and through the Corinthian Gulf it commanded the trade of\r\nthe Ionian and Sicilian seas.\r\n\r\n(M374) Corinth, by some, is supposed have been a Phœnician colony. Before\r\nauthentic history begins, it was inhabited by a mixed population of\r\nÆolians and Ionians, the former of whom were dominant. Over them reigned\r\nSisyphus, according to tradition, the grandfather of Bellerophon who laid\r\nthe foundation of mercantile prosperity. The first historical king was\r\nAletes, B.C. 1074, the leader of Dorian invaders, who subdued the Æolians,\r\nand incorporated them with their own citizens. The descendants of Aletes\r\nreigned twelve generations, when the nobles converted the government into\r\nan oligarchy, under Bacchis, who greatly increased the commercial\r\nimportance of the city. In 754, B.C., Corinth began to colonize, and\r\nfitted out a war fleet for the protection of commerce. The oligarchy was\r\nsupplanted by Cypselus, B.C. 655, a man of the people, whose mother was of\r\nnoble birth, but rejected by her family, of the ruling house of the\r\nBacchiadæ, on account of lameness. His son Periander reigned forty years\r\nwith cruel despotism, but made Corinth the leading commercial city of\r\nGreece, and he subjected to her sway the colonies planted on the islands\r\nof the Ionian Sea, one of which was Corcyra (Corfu), which gained a great\r\nmercantile fame. It was under his reign that the poet Arion, or Lesbos,\r\nflourished, to whom he gave his patronage. In three years after the death\r\nof Periander, 585 B.C., the oligarchal power was restored, and Corinth\r\nallied herself with Sparta in her schemes of aggrandizement.\r\n\r\n(M375) The same change of government was seen in Megara, a neighboring\r\nState, situated on the isthmus, between Corinth and Attica, and which\r\nattained great commercial distinction. As a result of commercial opulence,\r\nthe people succeeded in overthrowing the government, an oligarchy of\r\nDorian conquerors, and elevating a demagogue, Theagenes, to the supreme\r\npower, B.C. 630. He ruled tyrannically, in the name of the people, for\r\nthirty years, but was expelled by the oligarchy, which regained power.\r\nDuring his reign all kinds of popular excesses were perpetrated,\r\nespecially the confiscation of the property of the rich.\r\n\r\n(M376) Other States are also illustrations of this change of government\r\nfrom kings to oligarchies, and oligarchies to demagogues and tyrants, as\r\non the isle of Lesbos, where Pittacus reigned dictator, but with wisdom\r\nand virtue—one of the seven wise men of Greece—and in Samos, where\r\nPolycrates rivaled the fame of Periander, and adorned his capital with\r\nbeautiful buildings, and patronized literature and art. One of his friends\r\nwas Anacreon, the poet. He was murdered by the Persians, B.C. 522.\r\n\r\nBut the State which most signally illustrates the revolutions in\r\ngovernment was Athens.\r\n\r\n“Where on the Ægean shore a city stands,—\r\nBuilt nobly; pure the air, and light the soil:\r\nAthena, the eye of Greece, mother of arts\r\nAnd eloquence, native to famous wits.”\r\n\r\n(M377) Every thing interesting or impressive in the history of classical\r\nantiquity clusters round this famous city, so that without Athens there\r\ncould be no Greece. Attica, the little State of which it was the capital,\r\nformed a triangular peninsula, of about seven hundred square miles. The\r\ncountry is hilly and rocky, and unfavorable to agriculture; but such was\r\nthe salubrity of the climate, and the industry of the people, all kinds of\r\nplants and animals flourished. The history of the country, like that of\r\nthe other States, is mythical, to the period of the first Olympiad. Ogyges\r\nhas the reputation of being the first king of a people who claimed to be\r\nindigenous, about one hundred and fifty years before the arrival of\r\nCecrops, who came, it is supposed, from Egypt, and founded Athens, and\r\ntaught the simple but savage natives a new religion, and the elements of\r\ncivilized life, 1556 B.C. It received its name from the goddess Neith,\r\nintroduced by him from Egypt, under the name of Athena, or Minerva. It was\r\nalso called Cecropia, from its founder. Until the time of Theseus it was a\r\nsmall town, confined to the Acropolis and Mars Hill. This hero is the\r\ngreat name of ancient Athenian legend, as Hercules is to Greece generally.\r\nHe cleared the roads of robbers, and formed an aristocratical\r\nconstitution, with a king, who was only the first of his nobles. But he\r\nhimself, after having given political unity, was driven away by a\r\nconspiracy of nobles, leaving the throne to Menesthius, a descendant of\r\nthe ancient kings. This monarch reigned twenty-four years, and lost his\r\nlife at the siege of Troy. The whole period of the monarchy lies within\r\nthe mythical age. Tradition makes Codrus the last king, who was slain\r\nduring an invasion of the Dorians, B.C. 1045. Resolving to have no future\r\nking, the Athenians substituted the office of archon, or ruler, and made\r\nhis son, Medus, the superior magistrate. This office remained hereditary\r\nin the family of Codrus for thirteen generations. In B.C. 752, the\r\nduration of the office was fixed for ten years. It remained in the family\r\nof Codrus thirty-eight years longer, when it was left open for all the\r\nnobles. In 683 B.C. nine archons were annually elected from the nobles,\r\nthe first having superior dignity.\r\n\r\n(M378) The first of these archons, of whom any thing of importance is\r\nrecorded, was Draco, who governed Athens in the year 624 B.C., who\r\npromulgated written laws, exceedingly severe, inflicting capital\r\npunishment for slight offenses. The people grew weary of him and his laws,\r\nand he was banished to Ægina, where he died, from a conspiracy headed by\r\nCylon, one of the nobles, who seized the Acropolis, B.C. 612. His\r\ninsurrection, however, failed, and he was treacherously put to death by\r\none of the archons, which led to the expulsion of the whole body, and a\r\nchange in the constitution.\r\n\r\n(M379) This was effected by Solon, the Athenian sage and law-giver—himself\r\nof the race of Codrus, whom the Athenians chose as archon, with full power\r\nto make new laws. Intrusted with absolute power, he abstained from abusing\r\nit—a patriot in the most exalted sense, as well as a poet and philosopher.\r\nUrged by his friends to make himself tyrant, he replied that tyranny might\r\nbe a fair country, only there was no way out of it.\r\n\r\n(M380) When he commenced his reforms, the nobles, or Eupatridæ, were in\r\npossession of most of the fertile land of Attica, while the poorer\r\ncitizens possessed only the sterile highlands. This created an unhappy\r\njealousy between the rich and poor. Besides, there was another class that\r\nhad grown rich by commerce, animated by the spirit of freedom. But their\r\ninfluence tended to widen the gulf between the rich and poor. The poor got\r\ninto debt, and fell in the power of creditors, and sunk to the condition\r\nof serfs, and many were even sold in slavery, for the laws were severe\r\nagainst debtors, as in ancient Rome. Solon, like Moses in his institution\r\nof the Year of Jubilee, set free all the estates and persons that had\r\nfallen in the power of creditors, and ransomed such as were sold in\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n(M381) Having removed the chief source of enmity between the rich and\r\npoor, he repealed the bloody laws of Draco, and commenced to remodel the\r\npolitical constitution. The fundamental principles which he adopted was a\r\ndistribution of power to all citizens according to their wealth. But the\r\nnobles were not deprived of their ascendency, only the way was opened to\r\nall citizens to reach political distinction, especially those who were\r\nenriched by commerce. He made an assessment of the landed property of all\r\nthe citizens, taking as the medium a standard of value which was\r\nequivalent to a drachma of annual produce. The first class, who had no\r\naristocratic titles, were called Pentacosio medimni, from possessing five\r\nhundred medimni or upward. They alone were eligible to the archonship and\r\nother high offices, and bore the largest share of the public burdens. The\r\nsecond class was called Knights, because they were bound to serve as\r\ncavalry. They filled the inferior offices, farmed the revenue, and had the\r\ncommerce of the country in their hands.\r\n\r\n(M382) The third class was called Zeugitæ (yokesmen), from their ability\r\nto keep a yoke of oxen. They were small farmers, and served in the\r\nheavy-armed infantry, and were subject to a property-tax. All those whose\r\nincomes fell short of two hundred medimni formed the fourth class, and\r\nserved in the light-armed troops, and were exempt from property-tax, but\r\ndisqualified for public office, and yet they had a vote in popular\r\nelections, and in the judgment passed upon archons at the expiration of\r\noffice. “The direct responsibility of all the magistrates to the popular\r\nassembly, was the most democratic of all the institutions of Solon; and\r\nthough the government was still in the hands of the oligarchy, Solon\r\nclearly foresaw, if he did not purposely prepare for, the preponderance of\r\nthe popular element.” “To guard against hasty measures, he also instituted\r\nthe Senate of four hundred, chosen year by year, from the four Ionic\r\ntribes, whose office was to prepare all business for the popular assembly,\r\nand regulate its meetings. The Areopagus retained its ancient functions,\r\nto which Solon added a general oversight over all the public institutions,\r\nand over the private life of the citizens. He also enacted many other laws\r\nfor the administration of justice, the regulation of social life, the\r\nencouragement of commerce, and the general prosperity of the State.” His\r\nwhole legislation is marked by wisdom and patriotism, and adaptation to\r\nthe circumstances of the people who intrusted to him so much power and\r\ndignity. The laws were, however, better than the people, and his\r\nlegislative wisdom and justice place him among the great benefactors of\r\nmankind, for who can tell the ultimate influence of his legislation on\r\nRome and on other nations. The most beautiful feature was the\r\nresponsibility of the chief magistrates to the people who elected them,\r\nand from the fact that they could subsequently be punished for bad conduct\r\nwas the greatest security against tyranny and peculation.\r\n\r\n(M383) After having given this constitution to his countrymen, the\r\nlawgiver took his departure from Athens, for ten years, binding the people\r\nby a solemn oath to make no alteration in his laws. He visited Egypt,\r\nCyprus, and Asia Minor, and returned to Athens to find his work nearly\r\nsubverted by one of his own kinsmen. Pisistratus, of noble origin, but a\r\ndemagogue, contrived, by his arts and prodigality, to secure a guard,\r\nwhich he increased, and succeeded in seizing the Acropolis, B.C. 560, and\r\nin usurping the supreme authority—so soon are good laws perverted, so\r\neasily are constitutions overthrown, when demagogues and usurpers are\r\nsustained by the people. A combination of the rich and poor drove him into\r\nexile; but their divisions and hatreds favored his return. Again he was\r\nexiled by popular dissension, and a third time he regained his power, but\r\nonly by a battle. He sustained his usurpation by means of Thracian\r\nmercenaries, and sent the children of all he suspected as hostages to\r\nNaxos. He veiled his despotic power under the forms of the constitution,\r\nand even submitted himself to the judgment of the Areopagus on the charge\r\nof murder. He kept up his popularity by generosity and affability, by\r\nmingling freely with the citizens, by opening to them his gardens, by\r\nadorning the city with beautiful edifices, and by a liberal patronage of\r\narts and letters. He founded a public library, and collected the Homeric\r\npoems in a single volume. He ruled beneficently, as tyrants often\r\nhave,—like Cæsar, like Richelieu, like Napoleon,—identifying his own glory\r\nwith the welfare of the State. He died after a successful reign of\r\nthirty-three years, B.C. 527, and his two sons, Hippias and Hipparchus,\r\nsucceeded him in the government, ruling, like their father, at first\r\nwisely but despotically, cultivating art and letters and friendship of\r\ngreat men. But sensual passions led to outrages which resulted in the\r\nassassination of Hipparchus. Hippias, having punished the conspirators,\r\nchanged the spirit of the government, imposed arbitrary taxes, surrounded\r\nhimself with an armed guard, and ruled tyrannically and cruelly. After\r\nfour years of despotic government, Athens was liberated, chiefly by aid of\r\nthe Lacedæmonians, now at the highest of their power. Hippias retired to\r\nthe court of Persia, and planned and guided the attack of Darius on\r\nGreece—a traitor of the most infamous kind, since he combined tyranny at\r\nhome with the coldest treachery to his country. His accursed family were\r\ndoomed to perpetual banishment, and never succeeded in securing a pardon.\r\nTheir power had lasted fifty years, and had been fatal to the liberties of\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\n(M384) The Lacedæmonians did not retire until their king Cleomenes formed\r\na close friendship with Isagoras, the leader of the aristocratic party—and\r\nno people were prouder of their birth than the old Athenian nobles.\r\nOpposed to him was Cleisthenes, of the noble family of the Alcmæonids, who\r\nhad been banished in the time of Megacles, for the murder of Cylon, who\r\nhad been treacherously enticed from the sanctuary at the altar of Athena.\r\nCleisthenes gained the ear of the people, and prevailed over Isagoras, and\r\neffected another change in the constitution, by which it became still more\r\ndemocratic. He remodeled the basis of citizenship, heretofore confined to\r\nthe four Ionic tribes; and divided the whole country into demes, or\r\nparishes, each of which managed its local affairs. All freemen were\r\nenrolled in the demes, and became members of the tribes, now ten in\r\nnumber, instead of the old four Ionian tribes. He increased the members of\r\nthe senate from four to five hundred, fifty members being elected from\r\neach tribe. To this body was committed the chief functions of executive\r\ngovernment. It sat in permanence, and was divided into ten sections, one\r\nfor each tribe, and each section or committee, called _prytany_, had the\r\npresidency of the senate and ecclesia during its term. Each prytany of\r\nfifty members was subdivided into committees of ten, each of which held\r\nthe presidency for seven days, and out of these a chairman was chosen by\r\nlot every day, to preside in the senate and assembly, and to keep the keys\r\nof the Acropolis and treasury, and public seal. Nothing shows jealousy of\r\npower more than the brief term of office which the president exercised.\r\n\r\n(M385) The ecclesia, or assembly of the people, was the arena for the\r\ndebate of all public measures. The archons were chosen according to the\r\nregulations of Solon, but were stripped of their power, which was\r\ntransferred to the senate and ecclesia. The generals were elected by the\r\npeople annually, one from each tribe. They were called strategi, and had\r\nalso the direction of foreign affairs. It was as first strategus that\r\nPericles governed—“prime minister of the people.”\r\n\r\n(M386) In order to guard against the ascendency of tyrants—the great evil\r\nof the ancient States, Cleisthenes devised the institution of _ostracism_,\r\nby which a suspected or obnoxious citizen could be removed from the city\r\nfor ten years, though practically abridged to five. It simply involved an\r\nexclusion from political power, without casting a stigma on the character.\r\nIt was virtually a retirement, during which his property and rights\r\nremained intact, and attended with no disgrace. The citizens, after the\r\nsenate had decreed the vote was needful, were required to write a name in\r\nan oyster shell, and he who had less than six thousand votes was obliged\r\nto withdraw within ten days from the city. The wisdom of this measure is\r\nproved in the fact that no tyrannical usurpation occurred at Athens after\r\nthat of Pisistratus. This revolution which Cleisthenes effected was purely\r\ndemocratic, to which the aristocrats did not submit without a struggle.\r\nThe aristocrats called to their aid the Spartans, but without other effect\r\nthan creating that long rivalry which existed between democracy and\r\noligarchy in Greece, in which Sparta and Athens were the representatives.\r\n\r\nAbout this time began the dominion of Athens over the islands of the Ægean\r\nand the system of colonizing conquered States, This was the period which\r\nimmediately preceded the Persian wars, when Athens reached the climax of\r\npolitical glory.\r\n\r\n(M387) Next in importance to the States which have been briefly mentioned\r\nwas Bœotia, which contained fourteen cities, united in a confederacy, of\r\nwhich Thebes took the lead. They were governed by magistrates, called\r\nbœtarchs, elected annually. In these cities aristocratic institutions\r\nprevailed. The people were chiefly of Æolian descent, with a strong\r\nmixture of the Dorian element, and were dull and heavy, owing, probably,\r\nto the easy facilities of support, in consequence of the richness of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n(M388) At the west of Bœotia, Phocis, with its small territory, gained\r\ngreat consideration from the possession of the Delphic oracle; but its\r\npeople thus far, of Achæan origin, played no important part in the\r\npolitics of Greece.\r\n\r\n(M389) North of the isthmus lay the extensive plains of Thessaly, inclosed\r\nby lofty mountains. Nature favored this State more than any other in\r\nGreece for political pre-eminence, but inhabitants of Æolian origin were\r\nany thing but famous. At first they were governed by kings, but\r\nsubsequently an aristocratic government prevailed. They were represented\r\nin the Amphictyonic Council.\r\n\r\n(M390) The history of Macedonia is obscure till the time of the Persian\r\nwars; but its kings claimed an Heraclid origin. The Doric dialect\r\npredominated in a rude form.\r\n\r\n(M391) Epirus, west of Thessaly and Macedonia, was inhabited by various\r\ntribes, under their own princes, until the kings of Molossus, claiming\r\ndescent from Achilles, founded the dynasty which was so powerful under\r\nPyrrus.\r\n\r\nThere is but little interest connected with the States of Greece, before\r\nthe Persian wars, except Sparta, Athens, and Corinth; and hence a very\r\nbrief notice is all that is needed.\r\n\r\n(M392) But the Grecian colonies are of more importance. They were numerous\r\nin the islands of the Ægean Sea, in Epirus, and in Asia Minor, and even\r\nextended into Italy, Sicily, and Gaul. They were said to be planted as\r\nearly as the Trojan war by the heroes who lived to return—by Agamemnon on\r\nthe coast of Asia; by the sons of Theseus in Thrace; by Ialmenus on the\r\nEuxine; by Diomed and others in Italy. But colonization, to any extent,\r\ndid not take place until the Æolians invaded Bœotia, and the Dorians, the\r\nPeloponnesus. The Achæans, driven from their homes by the Dorians, sought\r\nnew seats in the East, under chieftains who claimed descent from Agamemnon\r\nand other heroes who went to the siege of Troy. They settled, first, on\r\nthe Isle of Lesbos, where they founded six cities. Others made settlements\r\non the mainland, from the Hermes to Mount Ida. But the greatest migration\r\nwas made by the Ionians, who, dislodged by Achæans, went first to Attica,\r\nand thence to the Cyclades and the coasts of Asia, afterward called Ionia.\r\nTwelve independent States were gradually formed of divers elements, and\r\nassumed the Ionian name. Among those twelve cities, or States, were\r\nSarnos, Chios, Miletus, Ephesus, Colophon, and Phocæa. The purest Ionian\r\nblood was found at Miletus, the seat of Neleus. These cities were probably\r\ninhabited by other races before the Ionians came. To these another was\r\nsubsequently added—Smyrna, which still retains its ancient name. The\r\nsouthwest corner of the Asiatic peninsula, about the same time, was\r\ncolonized by a body of Dorians, accompanied by conquered Achæans, the\r\nchief seat of which was Halicarnassus. Crete, Rhodes, Cos, and Cnidus,\r\nwere colonized also by the same people; but Rhodes is the parent of the\r\nGreek colonies on the south coast of Asia Minor. A century afterward,\r\nCyprus was founded, and then Sicily was colonized, and then the south of\r\nItaly. They were successively colonized by different Grecian tribes,\r\nAchæan or Æolian, Dorian, and Ionian. But all the colonists had to contend\r\nwith races previously established, Iberians, Phœnicians, Sicanians; and\r\nSicels. Among the Greek cities in Sicily, Syracuse, founded by Dorians,\r\nwas the most important, and became, in turn, the founder of other cities.\r\nSybaris and Croton, in the south of Italy, were of Achæan origin. The\r\nGreeks even penetrated to the northern part of Africa, and founded Cyrene;\r\nwhile, on the Euxine, along the north coast of Asia Minor, Cyzicus and\r\nSinope arose. These migrations were generally undertaken with the\r\napprobation and encouragement of the mother States. There was no colonial\r\njealousy, and no dependence. The colonists, straitened for room at home,\r\ncarried the benedictions of their fathers, and were emancipated from their\r\ncontrol. Sometimes the colony became more powerful than the parent State,\r\nbut both colonies and parent States were bound together by strong ties of\r\nreligion, language, customs, and interests. The colonists uniformly became\r\nconquerors where they settled, but ever retained their connection with the\r\nmother country. And they grew more rapidly than the States from which they\r\ncame, and their institutions were more democratic. The Asiatic colonies\r\nespecially, made great advances in civilization by their contact with the\r\nEast. Music, poetry, and art were cultivated with great enthusiasm. The\r\nIonians took the lead, and their principal city, Miletus, is said to have\r\nplanted no less than eighty colonies. The greatness of Ephesus was of a\r\nlater date, owing, in part, to the splendid temple of Artemis, to which\r\nAsiatics as well as Greeks made contributions. One of the most remarkable\r\nof the Greek colonies was Cyrene, on the coast of Africa, which was of\r\npeculiar beauty, and was famous for eight hundred years.\r\n\r\n(M393) So the Greeks, although they occupied a small territory, yet, by\r\ntheir numerous colonies in all those parts watered by the Mediterranean,\r\nformed, if not politically, at least socially, a powerful empire, and\r\nexercised a vast influence on the civilized world. From Cyprus to\r\nMarseilles—from the Crimea to Cyrene, numerous States spoke the same\r\nlanguage, and practiced the same rites, which were observed in Athens and\r\nSparta. Hence the great extent of country in Asia and Europe to which the\r\nGreek language was familiar, and still more the arts which made Athens the\r\ncentre of a new civilization. Some of the most noted philosophers and\r\nartists of antiquity were born in these colonies. The power of Hellas was\r\nnot a centralized empire, like Persia, or even Rome, but a domain in the\r\nheart and mind of the world. It was Hellas which worked out, in its\r\nvarious States and colonies, great problems of government, as well as\r\nsocial life. Hellas was the parent of arts, of poetry, of philosophy, and\r\nof all æsthetic culture—the pattern of new forms of life, and new modes of\r\ncultivation. It is this Grecian civilization which appeared in full\r\ndevelopment as early as five hundred years before the Christian era, which\r\nwe now propose, in a short chapter, to present—the era which immediately\r\npreceded the Persian wars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRECIAN CIVILIZATION BEFORE THE PERSIAN WARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly civilization. We understand by civilization the progress which\r\nnations have made in art, literature, material strength, social culture,\r\nand political institutions, by which habits are softened, the mind\r\nenlarged, the soul elevated, and a wise government, by laws established,\r\nprotecting the weak, punishing the wicked, and developing wealth and\r\nnational resources.\r\n\r\nSuch a civilization did exist to a remarkable degree among the Greeks,\r\nwhich was not only the admiration of their own times, but a wonder to all\r\nsucceeding ages, since it was established by the unaided powers of man,\r\nand affected the relations of all the nations of Europe and Asia which\r\nfell under its influence.\r\n\r\nIt is this which we propose briefly to present in this chapter, not the\r\nhighest developments of Grecian culture and genius, but such as existed in\r\nthe period immediately preceding the Persian wars.\r\n\r\n(M394) One important feature in the civilization of Greece was the\r\nprogress made in legislation by Lycurmis and Solon, But as this has been\r\nalluded to, we pass on to consider first those institutions which were\r\nmore national and universal.\r\n\r\n(M395) The peculiar situations of the various States, independent of each\r\nother, warlike, encroaching, and ambitious, led naturally to numerous\r\nwars, which would have been civil wars had all these petty States been\r\nunited under a common government. But incessant wars, growing out of\r\nendless causes of irritation, would have soon ruined these States, and\r\nthey could have had no proper development. Something was needed to\r\nrestrain passion and heal dissensions without a resort to arms, ever\r\nattended by dire calamities. And something was needed to unite these\r\nvarious States, in which the same language was spoken, and the same\r\nreligion and customs prevailed. This union was partially effected by the\r\nAmphictyonic Council. It was a congress, composed of deputies from the\r\ndifferent States, and deliberating according to rules established from\r\ntime immemorial. Its meetings were held in two different places, and were\r\nconvened twice a year, once in the spring, at Delphi, the other in the\r\nautumn, near the pass of Thermopylæ. Delphi was probably the original\r\nplace of meeting, and was, therefore, in one important sense, the capital\r\nof Greece. Originally, this council or congress was composed of deputies\r\nfrom twelve States, or tribes—Thessalians, Bœotians, Dorians, Ionians,\r\nPerrhæbians, Magnetes, Locrians, Octæans, Phthiots, Achæans, Melians, and\r\nPhocians. These tribes assembled together before authentic history\r\ncommences, before the return of the Heracleids. There were other States\r\nwhich were not represented in this league—Arcadia, Elis, Æolia, and\r\nAcarnania; but the league was sufficiently powerful to make its decisions\r\nrespected by the greater part of Greece. Each tribe, whether powerful or\r\nweak, had two votes in the assembly. Beside those members who had the\r\nexclusive power of voting, there were others, and more numerous, who had\r\nthe privilege of deliberation. The object of the council was more for\r\nreligious purposes than political, although, on rare occasions and\r\nnational crises, subjects of a political nature were discussed. The\r\ncouncil laid down the rules of war, by which each State that was\r\nrepresented was guaranteed against complete subjection, and the supplies\r\nof war were protected. There was no confederacy against foreign powers.\r\nThe functions of the league were confined to matters purely domestic; the\r\nobject of the league was the protection of temples against sacrilege. But\r\nthe council had no common army to execute its decrees, which were often\r\ndisregarded. In particular, the protection of the Delphic oracle, it acted\r\nwith dignity and effect, whose responses were universally respected.\r\n\r\n(M396) As the Delphic oracle was the object which engrossed the most\r\nimportant duties of the council, and the responses of this oracle in early\r\ntimes was a sacred law, the deliberations of the league had considerable\r\ninfluence, and were often directed to political purposes. But the\r\nimmediate management of the oracle was in the hands of the citizens of\r\nDelphi. In process of time the responses of the oracle, by the mouth of a\r\nwoman, which were thus controlled by the Delphians, lost much of their\r\nprestige, in consequence of the presents or bribery by which favorable\r\nresponses were gained.\r\n\r\n(M397) More powerful than this council, as an institution, were the\r\nOlympic games, solemnized every four years, in which all the states of\r\nGreece took part. These games lasted four days, and were of engrossing\r\ninterest. They were supposed to be founded by Hercules, and were of very\r\nancient date. During these celebrations there was a universal truce, and\r\nalso during the time it was necessary for the people to assemble and\r\nretire to their homes. Elis, in whose territory Olympia was situated, had\r\nthe whole regulation of the festival, the immediate object of which were\r\nvarious trials of strength and skill. They included chariot races, foot\r\nraces, horse races, wrestling, boxing, and leaping. They were open to all,\r\neven to the poorest Greeks; no accidents of birth or condition affected\r\nthese honorable contests. The palm of honor was given to the men who had\r\nreal merit. A simple garland of leaves was the prize, but this was\r\nsufficient to call out all the energies and ambition of the whole nation.\r\nThere were, however, incidental advantages to successful combatants. At\r\nAthens, the citizen who gained a prize was rewarded by five hundred\r\ndrachmas, and was entitled to a seat at the table of the magistrates, and\r\nhad a conspicuous part on the field of battle. The victors had statues\r\nerected to them, and called forth the praises of the poets, and thus these\r\nprimitive sports incidentally gave an impulse to art and poetry. In later\r\ntimes, poets and historians recited their compositions, and were rewarded\r\nwith the garland of leaves. The victors of these games thus acquired a\r\nsocial pre-eminence, and were held in especial honor, like those heroes in\r\nthe Middle Ages who obtained the honor of tournaments and tilts, and, in\r\nmodern times, those who receive decoration at the hands of kings.\r\n\r\n(M398) The celebrity of the Olympic games, which drew spectators from Asia\r\nas well as all the States of Greece, led to similar institutions or\r\nfestivals in other places. The Pythian games, in honor of Apollo, were\r\ncelebrated near Delphi every third Olympic year; and various musical\r\ncontests, exercises in poetry, exhibitions of works of art were added to\r\ngymnastic exercises and chariot and horse races. The sacrifices,\r\nprocessions, and other solemnities, resemble those at Olympia in honor of\r\nZeus. They lasted as long as the Olympic games, down to A.D. 394. Wherever\r\nthe worship of Apollo was introduced, there were imitations of these\r\nPythian games in all the States of Greece.\r\n\r\n(M399) The Nemæan and Ithmian games were celebrated each twice in every\r\nOlympiad, the former on the plain of Nemæa, in Argolis; the latter in the\r\nCorinthian Isthmus, under the presidency of Corinth. These also claimed a\r\nhigh antiquity, and at these were celebrated the same feats of strength as\r\nat Olympia. But the Olympic festival was the representation of all the\r\nrest, and transcended all the rest in national importance. It was viewed\r\nwith so much interest, that the Greeks measured time itself by them. It\r\nwas Olympiads, and not years, by which the date of all events was\r\ndetermined. The Romans reckoned their years from the foundation of their\r\ncity; modern Christian nations, by the birth of Christ; Mohammedans, by\r\nthe flight of the prophet to Medina; and the Greeks, from the first\r\nrecorded Olympiad, B.C. 776.\r\n\r\n(M400) It was in these festivals, at which no foreigner, however eminent,\r\nwas allowed to contend for prizes, that the Greeks buried their quarrels,\r\nand incited each other to heroism. The places in which they were\r\ncelebrated became marts of commerce like the mediæval fairs of Germany;\r\nand the vast assemblage of spectators favored that communication of news,\r\nand inventions, and improvements which has been produced by our modern\r\nexhibitions. These games answered all the purposes of our races, our\r\nindustrial exhibitions, and our anniversaries, religious, political,\r\neducational, and literary, and thus had a most decided influence on the\r\ndevelopment of Grecian thought and enterprise. The exhibition of sculpture\r\nand painting alone made them attractive and intellectual, while the\r\nathletic exercises amused ordinary minds. They were not demoralizing, like\r\nthe sports of the amphitheatre, or a modern bull-fight, or even\r\nfashionable races. They were more like tournaments in the martial ages of\r\nEurope, but superior to them vastly, since no woman was allowed to be\r\npresent at the Olympic games under pain of death.\r\n\r\n(M401) It has already been shown that the form of government in the States\r\nof Ancient Greece, in the Homeric ages, was monarchical. In two or three\r\nhundred years after the Trojan war, the authority of kings had greatly\r\ndiminished. The great immigration and convulsions destroyed the line of\r\nthe ancient royal houses. The abolition of royalty was in substance rather\r\nthan name. First, it was divided among several persons, then it was made\r\nelective, first for life, afterward for a definite period. The nobles or\r\nchieftains gained increasing power with the decline of royalty, and the\r\ngovernment became, in many States, aristocratic. But the nobles abused\r\ntheir power by making an oligarchy, which is a perverted aristocracy. This\r\naroused hatred and opposition on the part of the people, especially in the\r\nmaritime cities, where the increase of wealth by commerce and the arts\r\nraised up a body of powerful citizens. Then followed popular revolutions\r\nunder leaders or demagogues. These leaders in turn became tyrants, and\r\ntheir exactions gave rise to more hatred than that produced by the\r\ngovernment of powerful families. They gained power by stratagem, and\r\nperverted it by violence. But to amuse the people whom they oppressed, or\r\nto please them, they built temples, theatres, and other public buildings,\r\nin which a liberal patronage was extended to the arts. Thus Athens and\r\nCorinth, before the Persian wars, were beautiful cities, from the lavish\r\nexpenditure of the public treasury by the tyrants or despots who had\r\ngained ascendency. In the mean time, those who were most eminent for\r\nwealth, or power, or virtue, were persecuted, for fear they would effect a\r\nrevolution. But the parties which the tyrants had trampled upon were\r\nrather exasperated than ruined, and they seized every opportunity to rally\r\nthe people under their standard, and effect an overthrow of the tyrants.\r\nSparta, whose constitution remained aristocratic, generally was ready to\r\nassist any State in throwing off the yoke of the usurpers. In some States,\r\nlike Athens, every change favored the rise of the people, who gradually\r\nobtained the ascendency. They instituted the principle of legal equality,\r\nby which every freeman was supposed to exercise the attributes of\r\nsovereignty. But democracy invariably led to the ascendency of factions,\r\nand became itself a tyranny. It became jealous of all who were\r\ndistinguished for birth, or wealth, or talents. It encouraged flatterers\r\nand sycophants. It was insatiable in its demands on the property of the\r\nrich, and listened to charges which exposed them to exile and their\r\nestates to confiscation. It increased the public burdens by unwise\r\nexpenditures to please the men of the lower classes who possessed\r\npolitical franchise.\r\n\r\n(M402) But different forms of government existed in different States. In\r\nSparta there was an oligarchy of nobles which made royalty a shadow, and\r\nwhich kept the people in slavery and degradation. In Athens the democratic\r\nprinciple prevailed. In Argos kings reigned down to the Persian wars. In\r\nCorinth the government went through mutations as at Athens. In all the\r\nStates and cities experiments in the various forms of government were\r\nperpetually made and perpetually failed. They existed for a time, and were\r\nin turn supplanted. The most permanent government was that of Sparta; the\r\nmost unstable was that of Athens. The former promoted a lofty patriotism\r\nand public morality and the national virtues; the latter inequalities of\r\nwealth, the rise of obscure individuals, and the progress of arts.\r\n\r\n(M403) The fall of the ancient monarchies and aristocracies was closely\r\nconnected with commercial enterprise and the increase of a wealthy class\r\nof citizens. In the beginning of the seventh century before Christ, a\r\ngreat improvement in the art of ship-building was made, especially at\r\nCorinth. Colonial settlements kept pace with maritime enterprise; and both\r\nof these fostered commerce and wealth. The Euxine lost its terrors to\r\nnavigators, and the Ægean Sea was filled with ships and colonists. The\r\nAdriatic Sea was penetrated, and all the seas connected with the\r\nMediterranean. From the mouth of the Po was brought amber, which was\r\nhighly valued by the ancients. A great number of people were drawn to\r\nEgypt, by the liberal offers of its kings, who went there for the pursuit\r\nof knowledge and of wealth, and from which they brought back the papyrus\r\nas a cheap material for writing. The productions of Greece were exchanged\r\nfor the rich fabrics which only Asia furnished, and the cities to which\r\nthese were brought, like Athens and Corinth, rapidly grew rich, like\r\nVenice and Genoa in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n(M404) Wealth of course introduced art. The origin of art may have been in\r\nreligious ideas—in temples and the statues of the gods—in tombs and\r\nmonuments of great men. But wealth immeasurably increased the facilities\r\nboth for architecture and sculpture. Artists in old times, as in these,\r\nsought a pecuniary reward—patrons who could afford to buy their\r\nproductions, and stimulate their genius. Art was cultivated more rapidly\r\nin the Asiatic colonies than in the mother country, both on account of\r\ntheir wealth, and the objects of interest around them. The Ionian cities,\r\nespecially, were distinguished for luxury and refinement. Corinth took the\r\nlead in the early patronage of art, as the most wealthy and luxurious of\r\nthe Grecian cities.\r\n\r\n(M405) The first great impulse was given to architecture. The Pelasgi had\r\nerected Cyclopean structures fifteen hundred years before Christ. The\r\nDorians built temples on the severest principles of beauty, and the Doric\r\ncolumn arose, massive and elegant. Long before the Persian wars the\r\ntemples were numerous and grand, yet simple and harmonious. The temple of\r\nHere, at Samos, was begun in the eighth century, B.C., and built in the\r\nDoric style, and, soon after, beautiful structures ornamented Athens.\r\n\r\n(M406) Sculpture rapidly followed architecture, and passed from the\r\nstiffness of ancient times to that beauty which afterward distinguished\r\nPhidias and Polynotus. Schools of art, in the sixth century, flourished in\r\nall the Grecian cities. We can not enter upon the details, from the use of\r\nwood to brass and marble. The temples were filled with groups from\r\ncelebrated masters, and their deep recesses were peopled with colossal\r\nforms. Gold, silver, and ivory were used as well as marble and brass. The\r\nstatues of heroes adorned every public place. Art, before the Persian\r\nwars, did not indeed reach the refinement which it subsequently boasted,\r\nbut a great progress was made in it, in all its forms. Engraving was also\r\nknown, and imperfect pictures were painted. But this art, and indeed any\r\nof the arts, did not culminate until after the Persian wars.\r\n\r\n(M407) Literature made equal if not greater progress in the early ages of\r\nGrecian history. Hesiod lived B.C. 735; and lyric poetry flourished in the\r\nsixth and seventh centuries before Christ, especially the elegiac form, or\r\nsongs for the dead. Epic poetry was of still earlier date, as seen in the\r\nHomeric poems. The Æolian and Ionic Greeks of Asia were early noted for\r\ncelebrated poets. Alcæus and Sappho lived on the Isle of Lesbos, and were\r\nsurrounded with admirers. Anacreon of Teos was courted by the rulers of\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\n(M408) Even philosophy was cultivated at this early age. Thales of Miletus\r\nflourished in the middle of the seventh century, and Anaximander, born\r\nB.C. 610—one of the great original mathematicians of the world, speculated\r\nlike Thales, on the origin of things. Pythagoras, born in Samos, B.C.\r\n580—a still greater name, grave and majestic, taught the harmony of the\r\nspheres long before the Ionian revolt.\r\n\r\nBut neither art, nor literature, nor philosophy reached their full\r\ndevelopment till a later era. It is enough for our purpose to say that,\r\nbefore the Persian wars, civilization was by no means contemptible, in all\r\nthose departments which subsequently made Greece the teacher and the glory\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERSIAN WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the most important and interesting of Grecian history—the\r\ngreat contest with Persia—the age of heroes and of battle-fields, when\r\nmilitary glory was the master passion of a noble race. What inspiration\r\nhave all ages gained from that noble contest in behalf of liberty!\r\n\r\n(M409) We have seen how Asiatic cities were colonized by Greeks, among\r\nwhom the Ionians were pre-eminent. The cities were governed by tyrants,\r\nwho were sustained in their usurpation by the power of Persia, then the\r\ngreat power of the world. Darius, then king, had absurdly invaded Scythia,\r\nwith an immense army of six hundred thousand men, to punish the people for\r\ntheir inroad upon Western Asia, subject to his sway, about a century\r\nbefore. He was followed by his allies, the tyrants of the Ionian cities,\r\nto whom he intrusted the guardianship of the bridge of boats by which he\r\nhad crossed the Danube, B.C. 510. As he did not return within the time\r\nspecified—sixty days—the Greeks were left at liberty to return. A body of\r\nScythians then appeared, who urged the Greeks to destroy the bridge, as\r\nDarius was in full retreat, and thus secure the destruction of the Persian\r\narmy and the recovery of their own liberty. Miltiades, who ruled the\r\nChersonese—the future hero of Marathon, seconded the wise proposal of the\r\nScythians, but Histiæus, tyrant of Miletus, feared that such an act would\r\nrecoil upon themselves, and favor another inroad of Scythians—a fierce\r\nnation of barbarians. The result was that the bridge was not destroyed,\r\nbut the further end of it was severed from the shore. Night arrived, and\r\nthe Persian hosts appeared upon the banks of the river, but finding no\r\ntrace of it, Darius ordered an Egyptian who had a trumpet-voice to summon\r\nto his aid Histiæus, the Milesian. He came forward with a fleet and\r\nrestored the bridge, and Darius and his army were saved, and the\r\nopportunity was lost to the Ionians for emancipating themselves from the\r\nPersians. The bridge was preserved, not from honorable fidelity to fulfill\r\na trust, but selfish regard in the despot of Miletus to maintain his\r\npower. For this service he was rewarded with a principality on the\r\nStrymon. Exciting, however, the suspicion of Darius, by his intrigues, he\r\nwas carried captive to the Persian court, but with every mark of honor.\r\nDarius left his brother Artaphernes as governor of all the cities in\r\nWestern Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n(M410) A few years after this unsuccessful invasion of Scythia by Darius,\r\na political conflict broke out in Naxos, an island of the Cyclades, B.C.\r\n502, which had not submitted to the Persian yoke, and the oligarchy, which\r\nruled the island, were expelled. They applied for aid to Aristagoras, the\r\ntyrant of Miletus, the largest of the Ionian cities, who persuaded the\r\nPersian satrap to send an expedition against the island. The expedition\r\nfailed, which ruined the credit of Aristagoras, son-in-law to Histiæus,\r\nwho was himself incensed at his detention in Susa, and who sent a trusty\r\nslave with a message urging the Ionians to revolt. Aristagoras, as a means\r\nof success, conciliated popular favor throughout Asiatic Greece, by\r\nputting down the various tyrants—the instruments of Persian ascendency.\r\nThe flames of revolt were kindled, the despots were expelled, the revolted\r\ntowns were put in a state of defense, and Aristagoras visited Sparta to\r\ninvoke its aid, inflaming the mind of the king with the untold wealth of\r\nAsia, which would become his spoil. Sparta was then at war with her\r\nneighbors, and unwilling to become involved in so uncertain a contest.\r\nRejected at Sparta, Aristagoras proceeded to Athens, then the second power\r\nin Greece, and was favorably received, for the Athenians had a powerful\r\nsympathy with the revolted Ionians; they agreed to send a fleet of twenty\r\nships. When Aristagoras returned, the Persians had commenced the siege of\r\nMiletus. The twenty ships soon crossed the Ægean, and were joined by five\r\nEretrian ships coming to the succor of Miletus. An unsuccessful attempt of\r\nAristagoras on Sardis disgusted the Athenians, who abandoned the alliance.\r\nBut the accidental burning of the city, including the temple of the\r\ngoddess Cybele, encouraged the revolters, and incensed the Persians. Other\r\nGreek cities on the coast took part in the revolt, including the island of\r\nCyprus. The revolt now assumed a serious character. The Persians rallied\r\ntheir allies, among whom were the Phœnicians. An armament of Persians and\r\nPhœnicians sailed against Cyprus, and a victory on the land gave the\r\nPersians the control of the island. A large army of Persians and their\r\nallies collected at Sardis, and, under different divisions reconquered all\r\ntheir principal Ionian cities, except Miletus; but the Ionian fleet kept\r\nits ascendency at sea. Aristagoras as the Persians advanced, lost courage\r\nand fled to Myrkinus, where he shortly afterward perished.\r\n\r\n(M411) Meanwhile Histiæus presented himself at the gates of Miletus,\r\nhaving procured the consent of Darius to proceed thither to quell the\r\nrevolt. He was, however, suspected by the satrap, Artaphernes, and fled to\r\nChios, whose people he gained over, and who carried him back to Miletus.\r\nOn his arrival, he found the citizens averse to his reception, and was\r\nobliged to return to Chios, and then to Lesbos, where he abandoned himself\r\nto piracy.\r\n\r\n(M412) A vast Persian host, however, had been concentrated near Miletus,\r\nand with the assistance of the Phœnicians, invested the city by sea and\r\nland. The entire force of the confederated cities abandoned the Milesians\r\nto their fate, and took to their ships, three hundred and fifty-three in\r\nnumber, with a view of fighting the Phœnicians, who had six hundred ships.\r\nBut there was a want of union among the Ionian commanders, and the sailors\r\nabandoned themselves to disorder and carelessness; upon which Dionysius,\r\nof Phocæa, which furnished but three ships, rebuked the Ionians for their\r\nneglect of discipline. His rebuke was not thrown away, and the Ionians\r\nhaving their comfortable tents on shore, submitted themselves to the\r\nnautical labors imposed by Dionysius. At last, after seven days of work,\r\nthe Ionian sailors broke out in open mutiny, and refused longer to be\r\nunder the discipline of a man whose State furnished the smallest number of\r\nships. They left their ships, and resumed their pleasures on the shore,\r\nunwilling to endure the discipline so necessary in so great a crisis.\r\nTheir camp became a scene of disunion and mistrust. The Samians, in\r\nparticular, were discontented, and on the day of battle, which was to\r\ndecide the fortunes of Ionia, they deserted with sixty ships, and other\r\nIonians followed their example. The ships of Chios, one hundred in number,\r\nfought with great fidelity and resolution, and Dionysius captured, with\r\nhis three ships, three of the Phœnicians’. But these exceptional examples\r\nof bravery did not compensate the treachery and cowardice of the rest, and\r\nthe consequence was a complete defeat of the Ionians at Lade. Dionysius,\r\nseeing the ruin of the Ionian camp, did not return to his own city, and\r\nset sail for the Phœnician coast, doing all he could as a pirate.\r\n\r\n(M413) This victory of Lade enabled the Persians to attack Miletus by sea\r\nas well as land; the siege was prosecuted with vigor, and the city shortly\r\nfell. The adult male population was slain, while the women and children\r\nwere sent as slaves to Susa. The Milesian territory was devastated and\r\nstripped of its inhabitants. The other States hastened to make their\r\nsubmission, and the revolt was crushed, B.C. 496, five years after its\r\ncommencement. The Persian forces reconquered all the Asiatic Greeks,\r\ninsular and continental, and the Athenian Miltiades escaped with\r\ndifficulty from his command in the Chersonese, to his native city. All the\r\nthreats which were made by the Persians were realized. The most beautiful\r\nvirgins were distributed among the Persian nobles; the cities were\r\ndestroyed; and Samos alone remained, as a reward for desertion at the\r\nbattle of Lade.\r\n\r\n(M414) The reconquest of Ionia being completed, the satrap proceeded to\r\norganize the future government, the inhabitants now being composed of a\r\ngreat number of Persians. Meanwhile, Darius made preparations for the\r\ncomplete conquest of Greece. The wisdom of the advice of Miltiades, to\r\ndestroy the bridge over the Danube, when Darius and his army would have\r\nbeen annihilated by the Scythians, was now apparent. Mardonius was sent\r\nwith a large army into Ionia, who deposed the despots in the various\r\ncities, whom Artaphernes had reinstated, and left the people to govern\r\nthemselves, subject to the Persian dominion and tribute. He did not remain\r\nlong in Ionia, but passed with his fleet to the Hellespont, and joined his\r\nland forces. He transported his army to Europe, and began his march\r\nthrough Thrace. Thence marched into Macedonia, and subdued a part of its\r\ninhabitants. He then sent his fleet around Mount Athos, with a view of\r\njoining it with his army at the Gulf of Therma. But a storm overtook his\r\nfleet near Athos, and destroyed three hundred ships, and drowned twenty\r\nthousand men. This disaster compelled a retreat, and he recrossed the\r\nHellespont with the shame of failure. He was employed no more by the\r\nPersian king.\r\n\r\n(M415) Darius, incited by the traitor Hippias, made new preparation for\r\nthe invasion of Greece. He sent his heralds in every direction, demanding\r\nthe customary token of submission—earth and water. Many of the continental\r\ncities sent in their submission, including the Thebans, Thessalians, and\r\nthe island of Ægina, which was on bad terms with Athens. The heralds of\r\nDarius were put to death at Athens and Sparta, which can only be explained\r\nfrom the fiercest resentment and rage. These two powers made common cause,\r\nand armed all the other States over which they had influence, to resist\r\nthe Persian domination. Hellas, headed by Sparta, now resolved to put\r\nforth all its energies, and embarked, in desperate hostility. A war which\r\nSparta had been waging for several years against Argos crippled that\r\nancient State, and she was no longer the leading power. The only rival\r\nwhich Sparta feared was weakened, and full scope was given, for the\r\nprosecution of the Persian war. Ægina, which had submitted to Darius, was\r\nvisited by Cleomenes, king of Sparta, and hostages were sent to Athens for\r\nthe neutrality of that island. Athens and Sparta suspended their political\r\njealousies, and acted in concert to resist the common danger.\r\n\r\n(M416) By the spring of 490 B.C. the preparations of Darius were\r\ncompleted, and a vast army collected on a plain upon the Cilician shore. A\r\nfleet of six hundred ships convoyed it to the rendezvous at Samos. The\r\nexiled tyrant Hippias was present to guide the forces to the attack of\r\nAttica. The Mede Datis, and Artaphernes, son of the satrap of Sardis,\r\nnephew to Darius, were the Persian generals. They had orders from Darius\r\nto bring the inhabitants of Athens as slaves to his presence.\r\n\r\n(M417) The Persian fleet, fearing a similar disaster as happened near\r\nMount Athos, struck directly across the Ægean, from Samos to Eubœa,\r\nattacking on the way the intermediate islands. Naxos thus was invaded and\r\neasily subdued. From Naxos, Datis sent his fleet round the other Cyclades\r\nIslands, demanding reinforcements and hostages from all he visited, and\r\nreached the southern extremity of Eubœa in safety. Etruria was first\r\nsubdued, unable to resist. After halting a few days at this city, he\r\ncrossed to Attica, and landed in the bay of Marathon, on the eastern\r\ncoast. The despot Hippias, son of Pisistratus, twenty years after his\r\nexpulsion from Athens, pointed out the way.\r\n\r\n(M418) But a great change had taken place at Athens since his expulsion.\r\nThe city was now under democratic rule, in its best estate. The ten tribes\r\nhad become identified with the government and institutions of the city.\r\nThe senate of the areopagus, renovated by the annual archons, was in\r\nsympathy with the people. Great men had arisen under the amazing stimulus\r\nof liberty, among whom Miltiades, Themistocles, and Aristides were the\r\nmost distinguished. Miltiades, after an absence of six years in the\r\nChersonesus of Thrace, returned to the city full of patriotic ardor. He\r\nwas brought to trial before the popular assembly on the charge of having\r\nmisgoverned the Chersonese; but he was honorably acquitted, and was chosen\r\none of the ten generals of the republic annually elected. He was not,\r\nhowever, a politician of the democratic stamp, like Themistocles and\r\nAristides, being a descendant of an illustrious race, which traced their\r\nlineage to the gods; but he was patriotic, brave, and decided. His advice\r\nto burn the bridge over the Danube illustrates his character—bold and\r\nfar-seeing. Moreover, he was peculiarly hostile to Darius, whom he had so\r\ngrievously offended.\r\n\r\n(M419) Themistocles was a man of great native genius and sagacity. He\r\ncomprehended all the embarrassments and dangers of the political crisis in\r\nwhich his city was placed, and saw at a glance the true course to be\r\npursued. He was also bold and daring. He was not favored by the accidents\r\nof birth, and owed very little to education. He had an unbounded passion\r\nfor glory and for display. He had great tact in the management of party,\r\nand was intent on the aggrandizement of his country. His morality was\r\nreckless, but his intelligence was great—a sort of Mirabeau: with his\r\npassion, his eloquence, and his talents. His unfortunate end—a traitor and\r\nan exile—shows how little intellectual pre-eminence will avail, in the\r\nlong run, without virtue, although such talents as he exhibited will be\r\nfound useful in a crisis.\r\n\r\n(M420) Aristides was inferior to both Alcibiades and Themistocles in\r\ngenius, in resource, in boldness, and in energy; but superior in virtue,\r\nin public fidelity, and moral elevation. He pursued a consistent course,\r\nwas no demagogue, unflinching in the discharge of trusts, just, upright,\r\nunspotted. Such a man, of course, in a corrupt society, would be exposed\r\nto many enmities and jealousies. But he was, on the whole, appreciated,\r\nand died, in a period of war and revolution, a poor man, with unbounded\r\nmeans of becoming rich—one of the few examples which our world affords of\r\na man who believed in virtue, in God, and a judgment to come, and who\r\npreferred the future and spiritual to the present and material—a fool in\r\nthe eyes of the sordid and bad—a wise man according to the eternal\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n(M421) Aristides, Miltiades, and perhaps Themistocles, were elected among\r\nthe ten generals, by the ten tribes, in the year that Datis led his\r\nexpedition to Marathon. Each of the ten generals had the supreme command\r\nof the army for a day. Great alarm was felt at Athens as tidings reached\r\nthe city of the advancing and conquering Persians. Couriers were sent in\r\nhot haste to the other cities, especially Sparta, and one was found to\r\nmake the journey to Sparta on foot—one hundred and fifty miles—in\r\nforty-eight hours. The Spartans agreed to march, without delay, after the\r\nlast quarter of the moon, which custom and superstition dictated. This\r\ndelay was fraught with danger, but was insisted upon by the Spartans.\r\n\r\n(M422) Meanwhile the dangers multiplied and thickened, that not a moment\r\nshould be lost in bringing the Persians into action. Five of the generals\r\ncounseled delay. The polemarch, Calimachus, who then had the casting vote,\r\ndecided for immediate action. Themistocles and Aristides had seconded the\r\nadvice of Miltiades, to whom the other generals surrendered their days of\r\ncommand—a rare example of patriotic disinterestedness. The Athenians\r\nmarched at once to Marathon to meet their foes, and were joined by the\r\nPlatæans, one thousand warriors, from a little city—the whole armed\r\npopulation, which had a great moral effect.\r\n\r\n(M423) The Athenians had only ten thousand hoplites, including the one\r\nthousand from Platæa. The Persian army is variously estimated at from one\r\nhundred and ten thousand to six hundred thousand. The Greeks were encamped\r\nupon the higher ground overlooking the plain which their enemies occupied.\r\nThe fleet was ranged along the beach. The Greeks advanced to the combat in\r\nrapid movement, urged on by the war-cry, which ever animated their\r\ncharges. The wings of the Persian army were put to flight by the audacity\r\nof the charge, but the centre, where the best troops were posted, resisted\r\nthe attack until Miltiades returned from the pursuit of the retreating\r\nsoldiers on the wings. The defeat of the Persians was the result. They\r\nfled to their ships, and became involved in the marshes. Six thousand four\r\nhundred men fell on the Persian side, and only one hundred and ninety-two\r\non the Athenian. The Persians, though defeated, still retained their\r\nships, and sailed toward Cape Sunium, with a view of another descent upon\r\nAttica. Miltiades, the victor in the most glorious battle ever till then\r\nfought in Greece, penetrated the designs of the Persians, and rapidly\r\nretreated to Athens on the very day of battle. Datis arrived at the port\r\nof Phalerum to discover that his plans were baffled, and that the\r\nAthenians were still ready to oppose him. The energy and promptness of\r\nMiltiades had saved the city. Datis, discouraged, set sail, without\r\nlanding, to the Cyclades.\r\n\r\n(M424) The battle of Marathon, B.C. 490, must be regarded as one of the\r\ngreat decisive battles of the world, and the first which raised the\r\npolitical importance of the Greeks in the eyes of foreign powers. It was\r\nfought by Athens twenty years after the expulsion of the tyrants, and as a\r\ndemocratic State. On the Athenians rest the glory forever. It was not\r\nimportant for the number of men who fell on either side, but for giving\r\nthe first great check to the Persian domination, and preventing their\r\nconquest of Europe. And its moral effect was greater than its political.\r\nIt freed the Greeks from that fear of the Persians which was so fatal and\r\nuniversal, for the tide of Persian conquest had been hitherto\r\nuninterrupted. It animated the Greeks with fresh courage, for the bravery\r\nof the Athenians had been unexampled, as had been the generalship of\r\nMiltiades. Athens was delivered by the almost supernatural bravery of its\r\nwarriors, and was then prepared to make those sacrifices which were\r\nnecessary in the more desperate struggles which were to come. And it\r\ninspired the people with patriotic ardor, and upheld the new civil\r\nconstitution. It gave force and dignity to the democracy, and prepared it\r\nfor future and exalted triumphs. It also gave force to the religious\r\nsentiments of the people, for such a victory was regarded as owing to the\r\nspecial favor of the gods.\r\n\r\nThe Spartans did not arrive until after the battle had been fought, and\r\nDatis had returned with his Etrurian prisoners to Asia.\r\n\r\n(M425) The victory of Marathon raised the military fame of Miltiades to\r\nthe most exalted height, and there were no bounds to the enthusiasm of the\r\nAthenians. But the victory turned his head, and he lost both prudence and\r\npatriotism. He persuaded his countrymen, in the full tide of his\r\npopularity, to intrust him with seventy ships, with an adequate force,\r\nwith powers to direct an expedition according to his pleasure. The\r\narmament was cheerfully granted. But he disgracefully failed in an attack\r\non the island of Paros, to gratify a private vindictive animosity. He lost\r\nall his _éclat_ and was impeached. He appealed, wounded and disabled from\r\na fall he had received, to his previous services. He was found guilty, but\r\nescaped the penalty of death, but not of a fine of fifty talents. He did\r\nnot live to pay it, or redeem his fame, but died of the injury he had\r\nreceived. Thus this great man fell from a pinnacle of glory to the deepest\r\ndisgrace and ruin—a fate deserved, for he was not true to himself or\r\ncountry. The Athenians were not to blame, but judged him rightly. It was\r\nnot fickleness, but a change in their opinions, founded on sufficient\r\ngrounds, from the deep disappointment in finding that their hero was\r\nunworthy of their regards. No man who had rendered a favor has a claim to\r\npursue a course of selfishness and unlawful ambition. No services can\r\noffset crimes. The Athenians, in their unbounded admiration, had given\r\nunbounded trust, and that trust was abused. And as the greatest despots\r\nwho had mounted to power had earned their success by early services, so\r\nhad they abused their power by imposing fetters, and the Athenians, just\r\nescaped from the tyranny of these despots, felt a natural jealousy and a\r\ndeep repugnance, in spite of their previous admiration. The Athenians, in\r\ntheir treatment of Miltiades, were neither ungrateful nor fickle, but\r\nacted from a high sense of public morality, and in a stern regard to\r\njustice, without which the new constitution would soon have been\r\nsubverted. On the death of Miltiades Themistocles and Aristides became the\r\ntwo leading men of Athens, and their rivalries composed the domestic\r\nhistory of the city, until the renewed and vast preparations of the\r\nPersians caused all dissensions to be suspended for the public good.\r\n\r\n(M426) But the jealousies and rivalries of these great men were not\r\naltogether personal. They were both patriotic, but each had different\r\nviews respecting the course which Athens should adopt in the greatness of\r\nthe dangers which impended. The policy of Aristides was to strengthen the\r\narmy—that of Themistocles, the navy. Both foresaw the national dangers,\r\nbut Themistocles felt that the hopes of Greece rested on ships rather than\r\narmies to resist the Persians. And his policy was adopted. As the world\r\ncan not have two suns, so Athens could not be prospered by the presence of\r\ntwo such great men, each advocating different views. One or the other must\r\nsuccumb to the general good, and Aristides was banished by the power of\r\nostracism.\r\n\r\n(M427) The wrath of Darius—a man of great force of character, but haughty\r\nand self-sufficient, was tremendous when he learned the defeat of Datis,\r\nand his retreat into Asia. He resolved to bring the whole force of the\r\nPersian empire together to subdue the Athenians, from whom he had suffered\r\nso great a disgrace. Three years were spent in active preparations for a\r\nnew expedition which should be overwhelming. All the allies of Persia were\r\ncalled upon for men and supplies. Nor was he deterred by a revolt of\r\nEgypt, which broke out about this time, and he was on the point of\r\ncarrying two gigantic enterprises—one for the reconquest of Egypt, and the\r\nother for the conquest of Greece—when he died, after a reign of thirty-six\r\nyears, B.C. 485.\r\n\r\n(M428) He was succeeded by his son Xerxes, who was animated by the\r\nanimosities, but not the genius of his father. Though beautiful and tall,\r\nhe was faint-hearted, vain, blinded by a sense of power, and enslaved by\r\nwomen. Yet he continued the preparations which Darius projected. Egypt was\r\nfirst subdued by his generals, and he then turned his undivided attention\r\nto Greece. He convoked the dignitaries of his empire—the princes and\r\ngovernors of provinces, and announced his resolution to bridge over the\r\nHellespont and march to the conquest of Europe. Artabanus, his uncle,\r\ndissuaded him from the enterprise, setting forth especially the\r\nprobability that the Greeks, if victorious at sea, would destroy the\r\nbridge, and thus prevent his safe return. Mardonius advised differently,\r\nurging ambition and revenge, motives not lost on the Persian monarch. For\r\nfour years the preparations went forward from all parts of the empire,\r\nincluding even the islands in the Ægean. In the autumn of 481 B.C., the\r\nlargest army this world has ever seen assembled at Sardis. Besides this, a\r\npowerful fleet of one thousand two hundred and seven ships of war, besides\r\ntransports, was collected at the Hellespont. Large magazines of provisions\r\nwere formed along the coast of Asia Minor. A double bridge of boats,\r\nextending from Abydos to Sestos—a mile in length across the Hellespont,\r\nwas constructed by Phœnicians and Egyptians; but this was destroyed by a\r\nstorm. Xerxes, in a transport of fury, caused the heads of the engineers\r\nto be cut off, and the sea itself scourged with three hundred lashes. This\r\ninsane wrath being expended, the monarch caused the work to be at once\r\nreconstructed, this time by the aid of Greek engineers. Two bridges were\r\nbuilt side by side upon more than six hundred large ships, moored with\r\nstrong anchors, with their heads toward the Ægean. Over each bridge were\r\nsketched six vast cables, which held the ships together, and over these\r\nwere laid planks of wood, upon which a causeway was formed of wood and\r\nearth, with a high palisade on each side. To facilitate his march, Xerxes\r\nalso constructed a canal across the isthmus which connects Mount Athos\r\nwith the main land, on which were employed Phœnician engineers. The men\r\nemployed in digging the canal worked under the whip. Bridges were also\r\nthrown across the river Strymon.\r\n\r\n(M429) These works were completed while Xerxes wintered at Sardis. From\r\nthat city he dispatched heralds to all the cities of Greece, except Sparta\r\nand Athens, to demand the usual tokens of submission—earth and water. He\r\nalso sent orders to the maritime cities of Thrace and Macedonia to prepare\r\ndinner for himself and hosts, as they passed through. Greece was struck\r\nwith consternation as the news reached the various cities of the vast\r\nforces which were on the march to subdue them. The army proceeded from\r\nSardis, in the spring, in two grand columns, between which was the king\r\nand guards and select troops—all native Persians, ten thousand foot and\r\nten thousand horse. From Sardis the hosts of Xerxes proceeded to Abydos,\r\nthrough Ilium, where his two bridges across the Hellespont awaited him.\r\nFrom a marble throne the proud and vainglorious monarch saw his vast army\r\ndefile over the bridges, perfumed with frankincense and strewed with\r\nmyrtle boughs. One bridge was devoted to the troops, the other to the\r\nbeasts and baggage. The first to cross were the ten thousand household\r\ntroops, called Immortals, wearing garlands on their heads; then followed\r\nXerxes himself in his gilded chariot, and then the rest of the army. It\r\noccupied seven days for the vast hosts to cross the bridge. Xerxes then\r\ndirected his march to Doriscus, in Thrace, near the mouth of the Hebrus,\r\nwhere he joined his fleet. There he took a general review, and never,\r\nprobably, was so great an army marshaled before or since, and composed of\r\nso many various nations. There were assembled nations from the Indus, from\r\nthe Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Levant, the Ægean and the\r\nEuxine—Egyptian, Ethiopian, and Lybian. Forty-six nations were\r\nrepresented—all that were tributary to Persia. From the estimates made by\r\nHerodotus, there were one million seven hundred thousand foot, eighty\r\nthousand horse, besides a large number of chariots. With the men who\r\nmanned the fleet and those he pressed into his service on the march, the\r\naggregate of his forces was two million six hundred and forty thousand.\r\nScarcely an inferior number attended the soldiers as slaves, sutlers, and\r\nother persons, swelling the amount of the males to five million two\r\nhundred and eighty-three thousand two hundred and twenty—the whole\r\navailable force of the Eastern world—Asia against Europe: as in mediæval\r\ntimes it was Europe against Asia. It is, however, impossible for us to\r\nbelieve in so large a force, since it could not have been supplied with\r\nprovisions. But with every deduction, it was still the largest army the\r\nworld ever saw.\r\n\r\n(M430) After the grand enumeration of forces, Xerxes passed in his chariot\r\nto survey separately each body of contingents, to which he put questions.\r\nHe then embarked in a gilded galley, and sailed past the prows of the\r\ntwelve hundred ships moored four hundred feet from the shore. That such a\r\nvast force could be resisted was not even supposed to be conceivable by\r\nthe blinded monarch. But Demaratus, the exiled king of Sparta, told him he\r\nwould be resisted unto death, a statement which was received with\r\nderision.\r\n\r\n(M431) After the review, the grand army pursued its course westward in\r\nthree divisions and roads along Thrace, levying enormous contributions on\r\nall the Grecian towns, which submitted as the Persian monarch marched\r\nalong, for how could they resist? The mere provisioning this great host\r\nfor a single day impoverished the country. But there was no help, for to\r\nmortal eyes the success of Xerxes was certain. At Acanthus, Xerxes\r\nseparated from his fleet, which was directed to sail round Mount Athos,\r\nwhile he pursued his march through Pæonia and Crestonia, and rejoin him at\r\nTherma, on the Thermaic Gulf, in Macedonia, within sight of Mount Olympus.\r\n\r\n(M432) Meanwhile, the Athenians, fully alive to their danger, strained\r\nevery nerve to make preparations to resist the enemy; fortunately, there\r\nwas in the treasury a large sum derived from the Lamian mines, and this\r\nthey applied, on the urgent representations of Themistocles, to building\r\nships and refitting their navy. A Panhellenic congress, under the\r\npresidency of Athens and Sparta, assembled at the Isthmus of Corinth.—the\r\nfirst great league since the Trojan war. The representatives of the\r\nvarious States buried their dissensions, the most prominent of which were\r\nbetween Athens and Ægina. In reconciling these feuds, Themistocles took a\r\npre-eminent part. Indeed, there was need, for the political existence of\r\nHellas was threatened, and despair was seen in most every city. Even the\r\nDelphic oracle gave out replies discouraging and terrible; intimating,\r\nhowever, that the safety of Athens lay in the wooden wall, which, with\r\nextraordinary tact, was interpreted by Themistocles to mean that the true\r\ndefense lay in the navy. Salamis was the place designated by the oracle\r\nfor the retreat, which was now imperative, and thither the Athenians fled,\r\nwith their wives and children, guarded by their fleet. It was decided by\r\nthe congress that Sparta should command the land forces, and Athens the\r\nunited navy of the Greeks; but many States, in deadly fear of the\r\nPersians, persisted in neutrality, among which were Argos, Cretes,\r\nCorcyra. The chief glory of the defense lay with Sparta and Athens. The\r\nunited army was sent into Thessaly to defend the defile of Tempe, but\r\ndiscovering that they were unable to do this, since another pass over\r\nMount Olympus was open in the summer, they retreated to the isthmus of\r\nCorinth, and left all Greece north of Mount Citheron and the Megarid\r\nterritory without defense. Had the Greeks been able to maintain the passes\r\nof Olympus and Ossa, all the northern States would probably have joined in\r\nthe confederation against Persia; but, as they were left defenseless, we\r\ncan not wonder that they submitted, including even the Achæans, Borotians,\r\nand Dorians.\r\n\r\n(M433) The Pass of Thermopylæ was now fixed upon as the most convenient\r\nplace of resistance, next to the vale of Tempe. Here the main land was\r\nseparated from the island of Eubœa by a narrow strait two miles wide. On\r\nthe northern part of the island, near the town of Histiæa, the coast was\r\ncalled Artemisium, and here the fleet was mustered, to co-operate with the\r\nland forces, and oppose, in a narrow strait, the progress of the Persian\r\nfleet. The defile of Thermopylæ itself, at the south of Thessaly, was\r\nbetween Mount Œta and an impassable morass on the Maliac Gulf. Nature had\r\nthus provided a double position of defense—a narrow defile on the land,\r\nand a narrow strait on the water, through which the army and the fleet\r\nmust need pass if they would co-operate.\r\n\r\n(M434) While the congress resolved to avail themselves of the double\r\nposition, by sea and land, the Olympic games, and the great Dorian, of the\r\nCarneia, were at hand. These could not be dispensed with, even in the most\r\nextraordinary crisis to which the nation could be exposed. While,\r\ntherefore, the Greeks assembled to keep the national festivals, probably\r\nfrom religious and superstitious motives, auguring no good if they were\r\ndisregarded, Leonidas, king of Sparta, with three hundred Spartans, two\r\nthousand one hundred and twenty Arcadians, four hundred Corinthians, two\r\nhundred men from Philius, and eighty from Mycenæ—in all three thousand one\r\nhundred hoplites, besides Helots and light troops, was sent to defend the\r\npass against the Persian hosts. On the march through Bœotia one thousand\r\nmen from Thebes and Thespiæ joined them, though on the point of submission\r\nto Xerxes. The Athenians sent their whole force on board their ships,\r\njoined by the Platæans.\r\n\r\n(M435) It was in the summer of 480 B.C. when Xerxes reached Therma, about\r\nwhich time the Greeks arrived at their allotted posts. Leonidas took his\r\nposition in the middle of the Pass—a mile in length, with two narrow\r\nopenings. He then repaired the old wall built across the Pass by the\r\nPhocians, and awaited the coming of the enemy, for it was supposed his\r\nforce was sufficient to hold it till the games were over. It was also\r\nthought that this narrow pass was the only means of access possible to the\r\ninvading army; but it was soon discovered that there was also a narrow\r\nmountain path from the Phocian territory to Thermopylæ. The Phocians\r\nagreed to guard this path, and leave the defense of the main pass to the\r\nPeloponnesian troops. But Leonidas painfully felt that his men were\r\ninsufficient in number, and found it necessary to send envoys to the\r\ndifferent States for immediate re-enforcements.\r\n\r\n(M436) The Greek fleet, assembled at Artemisium, was composed of two\r\nhundred and seventy-one triremes and nine penteconters, commanded by\r\nThemistocles, but furnished by the different States. A disaster happened\r\nto the Greeks very early; three triremes were captured by the Persians,\r\nwhich caused great discouragement, and in a panic the Greeks abandoned\r\ntheir strong naval position, and sailed up the Eubœan Strait to Chalcis.\r\nThis was a great misfortune, since the rear of the army of Leonidas was no\r\nlonger protected by the fleet. But a destructive storm dispersed the fleet\r\nof the Persians at this imminent crisis, so that it was impossible to lend\r\naid to their army now arrived at Thermopylæ. Four hundred ships of war,\r\ntogether with a vast number of transports, were thus destroyed. The storm\r\nlasted three days. After this disaster to the Persians, the Greek fleet\r\nreturned to Artemisium. Xerxes encamped within sight of Thermopylæ four\r\ndays, without making an attack, on account of the dangers to which his\r\nfleet were exposed. On the fifth day he became wroth at the impudence and\r\nboldness of the petty force which quietly remained to dispute his passage,\r\nfor the Spartans amused themselves with athletic sports and combing their\r\nhair. Nor was it altogether presumption on the part of the Greeks, for\r\nthere were four or five thousand heavily-armed men, the bravest in the\r\nland, to defend a passage scarcely wider than a carriage-road—with a wall\r\nand other defenses in front.\r\n\r\n(M437) The first attack on the Greeks was made by the Medea—the bravest of\r\nthe Persian army, but their arrows and short spears were of little avail\r\nagainst the phalanx which opposed, armed with long spears, and protected\r\nby shields. For two days the attack continued, and was constantly\r\nrepulsed, for only a small detachment of Greeks fought at a time. Even the\r\n“Immortals”—the chosen band of Xerxes—were repulsed with a great loss, to\r\nthe agony and shame of Xerxes.\r\n\r\n(M438) On the third day, a Malian revealed to the Persian king the fact\r\nthat a narrow path, leading over the mountains, was defended only by\r\nPhocians, and that this path led to the rear of the Spartans. A strong\r\ndetachment of Persians was sent in the night to secure this path, and the\r\nPhocian guardians fled. The Persians descended the path, and attacked the\r\nGreeks in their rear. Leonidas soon became apprised of his danger, but in\r\ntime to send away his army. It was now clear that Thermopylæ could no\r\nlonger be defended, but the heroic and self-sacrificing general resolved\r\nto remain, and sell his life as dearly as possible, and retard, if he\r\ncould not resist, the march of the enemy. Three hundred Spartans, with\r\nseven hundred Thespians and four hundred Thebans joined him, while the\r\nrest retired to fight another day. It required all the efforts of the\r\nPersian generals, assisted by the whip, to force the men to attack this\r\ndevoted band. The Greeks fought with the most desperate bravery, till\r\ntheir spears were broken, and no weapons remained but their swords and\r\ndaggers. At last, exhausted, they died, surrounded by vast forces, after\r\nhaving made the most heroic defence in the history of the war. Only one\r\nman, Aristodemus, returned to his home of all the three hundred Spartans,\r\nbut only to receive scorn and infamy. The Theban band alone yielded to the\r\nPersians, but only at the last hour.\r\n\r\n(M439) Nothing could exceed the blended anger and admiration of Xerxes as\r\nhe beheld this memorable resistance. He now saw, for the first time, the\r\ndifficulty of subduing such a people as the Greeks, resolved to resist\r\nunto death. His mind was perplexed, and he did not know what course to\r\nadopt. Had he accepted the advice of Demaratus, to make war on the\r\nsouthern coast of Laconia, and thus distract the Spartans and prevent\r\ntheir co-operation with Athens, he would have probably succeeded.\r\n\r\n(M440) But he followed other councils. Meanwhile, the Persian fleet\r\nrallied after the storm, and was still formidable, in spite of losses. The\r\nGreeks were disposed to retire and leave the strait open to the enemy. The\r\nEubœans, seeing the evil which would happen to them if their island was\r\nunprotected, sent to Themistocles a present of thirty talents, if he would\r\nkeep his position. This money he spent in bribing the different commanders\r\nwho wished to retire, and it was resolved to remain. The Persians,\r\nconfident of an easy victory, sent round the island of Eubœa a detachment\r\nof two hundred ships, to cut off all hopes of escape to the ships which\r\nthey expected to capture. A deserter revealed the intelligence to\r\nThemistocles, and it was resolved to fight the Persians, thus weakened, at\r\nonce, but at the close of the day, so that the battle would not be\r\ndecisive. The battle of Artemisium was a sort of skirmish, to accustom the\r\nGreeks to the Phœnician mode of fighting. It was, however, successful, and\r\nthirty ships of the Persians were taken or disabled.\r\n\r\n(M441) But the Greeks derived a greater succor than ships and men. Another\r\nstorm overtook the Persians, damaged their fleet, and destroyed the\r\nsquadron sent round the island of Eubœa. Another sea-fight was the result,\r\nsince the Greeks were not only aided by the storm, but new\r\nre-enforcements; but this second fight was indecisive. Themistocles now\r\nfelt he could not hold the strait against superior numbers, and the\r\ndisaster of Thermopylæ being also now known, he resolved to retreat\r\nfarther into Greece, and sailed for Salamis.\r\n\r\n(M442) At this period the Greeks generally were filled with consternation\r\nand disappointment. Neither the Pass of Thermopylæ, nor the strait which\r\nconnected the Malicas Gulf with the Ægean, had been successfully defended.\r\nThe army of Xerxes was advancing through Phocis and Bœotia to the Isthmus\r\nof Corinth, while the navy sailed unobstructed through the Eubœan Sea. On\r\nthe part of the Greeks there had been no preparations commensurate with\r\nthe greatness of the crisis, while, had they rallied to Thermopylæ,\r\ninstead of wasting time at the festivals, they would have saved the pass,\r\nand the army of Xerxes, strained for provisions, would have been compelled\r\nto retreat. The, Lacedæmonians, aroused by the death of their king, at\r\nlast made vigorous efforts to fortify the Isthmus of Corinth, too late,\r\nhowever, to defend Bœotia and Attica. The situation of Athens was now\r\nhopeless, and it was seen what a fatal mistake had been made not to\r\ndefend, with the whole force of Greece, the Pass of Thermopylæ. There was\r\nno help from the Spartans, for they had all flocked to the Isthmus of\r\nCorinth, as the last chance of protecting the Peloponnesus. In despair,\r\nthe Athenians resolved to abandon Athens, with their families, and take\r\nshelter at Salamis. Themistocles alone was undismayed, and sought to\r\nencourage his countrymen that the “wooden wall” would still be their\r\nsalvation. The Athenians, if dismayed, did not lose their energies. The\r\nrecall of the exiles was decreed by Themistocles’ suggestion. With\r\nincredible efforts the whole population of Attica was removed to Salamis,\r\nand the hopes of all were centered in the ships. Xerxes took possession of\r\nthe deserted city, but found but five hundred captives. He ravaged the\r\ncountry, and a detachment of Persians even penetrated to Delphi, to rob\r\nthe shrine, but were defeated. Athens was, however, sacked.\r\n\r\n(M443) The combined fleet of the Greeks now numbered three hundred and\r\nsixty-six ships, more than half of which were Athenian. Many wished to\r\nretreat to the Isthmus of Corinth, and co-operate with the Spartans.\r\nDissensions came near wrecking the last hopes of Greece, and Themistocles\r\nonly prevailed by threatening to withdraw the Athenian ships unless a\r\nbattle were at once fought. He resorted to stratagem to compel the fleet\r\nto remain together, with no outlet of escape if conquered. Aristides came\r\nin the night from Ægina, and informed the Greeks that their whole fleet\r\nwas surrounded by the Persians—just what Themistocles desired. There was\r\nnothing then left but to fight with desperation, for on the issue of the\r\nbattle depended the fortunes of Greece. Both fleets were stationed in the\r\nstrait between the bay of Eleusis and the Saronic Gulf, on the west of the\r\nisland of Salamis.\r\n\r\n(M444) Xerxes, seated upon a throne upon one of the declivities of Mount\r\nÆgaleos, surveyed the armaments and the coming battle. Both parties fought\r\nwith bravery; but the space was too narrow for the Persians to engage\r\ntheir whole fleet, and they had not the discipline of the Greeks, schooled\r\nby severe experience. The Persian fleet became unmanageable, and the\r\nvictory was gained by the Greeks. Two hundred ships fell into the hands of\r\nthe victors. But a sufficient number remained to the Persians to renew the\r\nbattle with better hopes. Xerxes, however, was intimidated, and in a\r\ntransport of rage, disappointment, and fear, gave the order to retreat. He\r\ndistrusted the fidelity of the allies, and feared for his own personal\r\nsafety; he feared that the victors would sail to the Hellespont, and\r\ndestroy the bridges. Themistocles, on the retreat of the Persians,\r\nemployed his fleet in levying fines and contributions upon the islands\r\nwhich had supported the Persians, while Xerxes made his way back to the\r\nHellespont, and crossed to Asia, leaving Mardonius in Thessaly, with a\r\nlarge army, to pursue the conquest on land.\r\n\r\n(M445) Thus Greece was saved by the battle of Salamis, and the\r\ndistinguished services of Themistocles, which can not be too highly\r\nestimated. The terrific cloud was dispersed, the Greeks abandoned\r\nthemselves to joy. Unparalleled honors were bestowed upon the victor,\r\nespecially in Sparta, and his influence, like that of Alcibiades, after\r\nthe battle of Marathon, was unbounded. No man ever merited greater reward.\r\n\r\n(M446) Though the Persians now abandoned all hopes of any farther maritime\r\nattack, yet still great success was anticipated from the immense army\r\nwhich Mardonius commanded. The Greeks in the northern parts still adhered\r\nto him, and Thessaly was prostrate at his feet. He sent Alexander, of\r\nMacedon, to Athens to offer honorable terms of peace, which were nobly\r\nrejected, and he was sent back with this message: “Tell Mardonius that as\r\nlong as the sun shall continue in his present path we will never contract\r\nalliance with a foe who has shown no reverence to our gods and heroes, and\r\nwho has burned their statues and houses.” The league was renewed with\r\nSparta for mutual defense and offense, in spite of seductive offers from\r\nMardonius; but the Spartans displayed both indifference and selfishness to\r\nany interests outside the Peloponnesus. They fortified the Isthmus of\r\nCorinth, but left Attica undefended. Mardonius accordingly marched to\r\nAthens, and again the city was the spoil of the Persians. The Athenians\r\nagain retreated to Salamis, with bitter feelings against Sparta for her\r\nselfishness and ingratitude. Again Mardonius sought to conciliate the\r\nAthenians, and again his overtures were rejected with wrath and defiance.\r\nThe Athenians, distressed, sent envoys to Sparta to remonstrate against\r\nher slackness and selfishness, not without effect, for, at last, a large\r\nSpartan force was collected under Pausanias. Meanwhile Mardonius ravaged\r\nAttica and Bœotia, and then fortified his camp near Platæa, ten furlongs\r\nsquare. Platæa was a plain favorable to the action of the cavalry, not far\r\nfrom Thebes; but his army was discouraged after so many disasters—in\r\nmodern military language, demoralized—while Artabazus, the second in\r\ncommand, was filled with jealousy. Nor could much be hoped from the\r\nGrecian allies, who secretly were hostile to the invaders. The Thebans and\r\nBœotians appeared to be zealous, but were governed by fear merely of a\r\nsuperior power, and hence were unreliable. It can not be supposed that the\r\nThebans, who sided with the Persians, by compulsion, preferred their cause\r\nto that of their countrymen, great as may have been national jealousy and\r\nrivalries.\r\n\r\n(M447) The total number of Lacedæmonians, Corinthians, Athenians, and\r\nother Greeks, assembled to meet the Persian army, B.C. 479, was\r\nthirty-eight thousand seven hundred men, heavily armed, and seventy-one\r\nthousand three hundred light armed, without defensive armor; but most of\r\nthese were simply in attendance on the hoplites. The Persians, about three\r\nhundred thousand in number, occupied the line of the river Asopus, on a\r\nplain; the Greeks stationed themselves on the mountain declivity near\r\nErythæ. The Persian cavalry charged, to dislodge the Greeks, unwilling to\r\ncontend on the plain; but the ground was unfavorable for cavalry\r\noperations, and after a brief success, was driven back, while the general,\r\nMasistias, who commanded it, was slain. His death, and the repulse of the\r\ncavalry, so much encouraged Pausanias, the Spartan general, that he\r\nquitted his ground on the mountain declivity, and took position on the\r\nplain beneath. The Lacedæmonians composed the right wing; the Athenians,\r\nthe left; and various other allies, the centre. Mardonius then slightly\r\nchanged his position, crossing the Asopus, nearer his own camp, and took\r\npost on the left wing, opposite the right wing of the Greeks, commanded by\r\nPausanias. Both armies then offered sacrifices to the gods, but Mardonius\r\nwas able to give constant annoyance to the Greeks by his cavalry, and the\r\nThebans gave great assistance. Ten days were thus spent by the two armies,\r\nwithout coming into general action, until Mardonius, on becoming\r\nimpatient, against the advice of Artabazus, second in command, resolved to\r\ncommence the attack. The Greeks were forewarned of his intention, by\r\nAlexander of Macedon, who came secretly to the Greek camp at night—a proof\r\nthat he, as well as others, were impatient of the Persian yoke. The\r\nLacedæmonians, posted in the right wing, against the Persians, changed\r\nplaces with the Athenians, who were more accustomed to Persian warfare;\r\nbut this manœuvre being detected, Mardonius made a corresponding change in\r\nhis own army—upon which Pausanias led back again his troops to the right\r\nwing, and a second movement of Mardonius placed the armies in the original\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n(M448) A vigorous attack of the Persian cavalry now followed, which so\r\nannoyed the Greeks, that Pausanias in the night resolved to change once\r\nagain his position, and retreated to the hilly ground, north of Platæa,\r\nabout twenty furlongs distant, not without confusion and mistrust on the\r\npart of the Athenians. Mardonias, astonished at this movement, pursued,\r\nand a general engagement followed. Both armies fought with desperate\r\ncourage, but discipline was on the side of the Greeks, and Mardonius was\r\nslain, fighting gallantly with his guard. Artabazus, with the forty\r\nthousand Persians under his immediate command, had not taken part, and now\r\ngave orders to retreat, and retired from Greece. The main body, however,\r\nof the defeated Persians retired to their fortified camp. This was\r\nattacked by the Lacedæmonians, and carried with immense slaughter, so that\r\nonly three thousand men survived out of the army of Mardonius, save the\r\nforty thousand which Artabazus—a more able captain—had led away. The\r\ndefeat of the Persians was complete, and the spoils which fell to the\r\nvictors was immense—gold and silver, arms, carpets, clothing, horses,\r\ncamels, and even the rich tent of Xerxes himself, left with Mardonius. The\r\nbooty was distributed among the different contingents of the army. The\r\nreal victors were the Lacedæmonians, Athenians, and Tegeans; the\r\nCorinthians did not reach the field till the battle was ended, and thus\r\nmissed their share of the spoil.\r\n\r\n(M449) There was one ally of the Persians which Pausanias resolved to\r\npunish—the city of Thebes when a merited chastisement was inflicted, and\r\nthe customary solemnities were observed, and honors decreed for the\r\ngreatest and most decisive victory which the Greeks had ever gained. A\r\nconfederacy was held at Platæa, in which a permanent league was made\r\nbetween the leading Grecian States, not to separate until the common foe\r\nwas driven back to Asia.\r\n\r\n(M450) While these great events were transpiring in Bœotia, the fleet of\r\nthe Greeks, after the battle of Salamis, undertook to rescue Samos from\r\nthe Persians, and secure the independence of the Ionian cities in Asia.\r\nThe Persian fleet, now disheartened, abandoned Samos and retired to\r\nMycale, in Ionia. The Greek fleet followed, but the Persians abandoned or\r\ndismissed their fleet, and joined their forces with those of Tigranes,\r\nwho, with an army of sixty thousand men, guarded Ionia. The Greeks\r\ndisembarked, and prepared to attack the enemy just as the news reached\r\nthem of the battle of Platæa. This attack was successful, partly in\r\nconsequence of the revolt of the Ionians in the Persian camp, although the\r\nPersians fought with great bravery. The battle of Mycale was as complete\r\nas that of Platæa and Marathon, and the remnants of the Persian army\r\nretired to Sardis. The Ionian cities were thus, for the time, delivered of\r\nthe Persians, as well as Greece itself chiefly by means of the Athenians\r\nand Corinthians. The Spartans, with inconceivable narrowness, were\r\nreluctant to receive the continental Ionians as allies, and proposed to\r\ntransport them across the Ægean into Western Greece, which proposal was\r\nmost honorably rejected by the Athenians. In every thing, except the\r\ndefense of Greece Proper, and especially the Peloponnesus, the Spartans\r\nshowed themselves inferior to the Athenians in magnanimity and enlarged\r\nviews. After the capture of Sestos, B.C. 478, which relieved the Thracian\r\nChersonese from the Persians, the fleet of Athens returned home. The\r\ncapture of this city concludes the narration of Herodotus, which ended\r\nvirtually the Persian war, although hostilities were continued in Asia.\r\nThe battle of Marathon had given the first effective resistance to Persian\r\nconquests, and created confidence among the Greeks. The battle of Salamis\r\nhad destroyed the power of Persia on the sea, and prevented any\r\nco-operation of land and naval forces. The battle of Platæa freed Greece\r\naltogether of the invaders. The battle of Mycale rescued the Ionian\r\ncities.\r\n\r\n(M451) Athens had, on the whole, most distinguished herself in this great\r\nand glorious contest, and now stood forth as the guardian of Hellenic\r\ninterests on the sea and the leader of the Ionian race. Sparta continued\r\nto take the lead of the military States, to which Athens had generously\r\nsubmitted. But a serious rivalry now was seen between these leading\r\nStates, chiefly through the jealousy of Sparta, which ultimately proved\r\nfatal to that supremacy which the Greeks might have maintained overall the\r\npowers of the world. Sparta wished that Athens might remain unfortified,\r\nin common with all the cities of Northern Greece, while the isthmus should\r\nbe the centre of all the works of defense. But Athens, under the sagacious\r\nand crafty management of Themistocles, amused the Spartans by delays,\r\nwhile the whole population were employed upon restoring its\r\nfortifications.\r\n\r\n(M452) Although the war against the Persians was virtually concluded by\r\nthe capture of Sestos, an expedition was fitted out by Sparta, under\r\nPausanias, the hero of Platæa, to prosecute hostilities on the shores of\r\nAsia. After liberating most of the cities of Cyprus, and wresting\r\nByzantium from the Persians, which thus left the Euxine free to Athenian\r\nships, from which the Greeks derived their chief supplies of foreign corn,\r\nPausanias, giddy with his victories, unaccountably began a treasonably\r\ncorrespondence with Xerxes, whose daughter he wished to marry, promising\r\nto bring all Greece again under his sway. He was recalled to Sparta,\r\nbefore this correspondence was known, having given offense by adopting the\r\nPersian dress, and surrounding himself with Persian and Median guards.\r\nWhen his treason was at last detected, he attempted to raise a rebellion\r\namong the Helots, but failed, and died miserably by hunger in the temple\r\nin which he had taken sanctuary.\r\n\r\n(M453) A fall scarcely less melancholy came to the illustrious\r\nThemistocles. In spite of his great services, his popularity began to\r\ndecline. He was hated by the Spartans for the part he took in the\r\nfortification of the city, who brought all their influence against him. He\r\ngave umbrage to the citizens by his personal vanity, continually boasting\r\nof his services. He erected a private chapel in honor of Artemis. He\r\nprostituted his great influence for arbitrary and corrupt purposes. He\r\naccepted bribes without scruple, to the detriment of the State, and in\r\nviolation of justice and right. And as the Persians could offer the\r\nhighest bribes, he was suspected of secretly favoring their interests. The\r\nold rivalries between him and Aristides were renewed; and as Aristides was\r\nno longer opposed to the policy which Athens adopted, of giving its\r\nsupreme attention to naval defenses, and, moreover, constantly had gained\r\nthe respect of the city by his integrity and patriotism, especially by his\r\nadmirable management at Delos, where he cemented the confederacy of the\r\nmaritime States, his influence was perhaps greater than that of\r\nThemistocles, stained with the imputation of _Medism_. Cimon, the son of\r\nMiltiades, also became a strong opponent. Though acquitted of accepting\r\nbribes from Persia, Themistocles was banished by a vote of ostracism, as\r\nAristides had been before—a kind of exile which was not dishonorable, but\r\nresorted to from regard to public interests, and to which men who became\r\nunpopular were often subjected, whatever may have been their services or\r\nmerits. He retired to Argos, and while there the treason of Pausanias was\r\ndiscovered. Themistocles was involved in it, since the designs of\r\nPausanias were known by him. Joint envoys from Sparta and Athens were sent\r\nto arrest him, which, when known, he fled to Corcyra, and thence to\r\nAdmetus, king of the Molossians. The Epirotic prince shielded him in spite\r\nof his former hostility, and furnished him with guides to Pydna, across\r\nthe mountains, from which he succeeded in reaching Ephesus, and then\r\nrepaired to the Persian court. At Athens he was proclaimed a traitor, and\r\nhis property, amounting to one hundred talents, accumulated by the war,\r\nwas confiscated. In Persia, he represented himself as a deserter, and\r\nsubsequently acquired influence with Artaxerxes, and devoted his talents\r\nto laying out schemes for the subjugation of Greece. He received the large\r\nsum of fifty talents yearly, and died at sixty-five years of age, with a\r\nblighted reputation, such as no previous services could redeem from\r\ninfamy.\r\n\r\n(M454) Aristides died four years after the ostracism of Themistocles,\r\nuniversally respected, and he died so poor as not to have enough for his\r\nfuneral expenses. Nor did any of his descendants ever become rich.\r\n\r\n(M455) Xerxes himself, the Ahasuerus of the Scriptures, who commanded the\r\nlargest expedition ever recorded in human annals, reached Sardis, eight\r\nmonths after he had left it, disgusted with active enterprise, and buried\r\nhimself amid the intrigues of his court and seraglio, in Susa, as recorded\r\nin the book of Esther. He was not deficient in generous impulses, but\r\ndeficient in all those qualities which make men victorious in war. He died\r\nfifteen years after, the victim of a conspiracy, in his palace, B.C.\r\n465—six years after Themistocles had sought his protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF PERICLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M456) With the defeat of the Persian armies, Athens and Sparta became,\r\nrespectively, the leaders of two great parties in Greece. Athens advocated\r\nmaritime interests and democratic institutions; Sparta, was the champion\r\nof the continental and oligarchal powers. The one was Ionian, and\r\norganized the league of Delos, under the management of Aristides; the\r\nother was Dorian, and chief of the Peloponnesian confederacy. The\r\nrivalries between these leading States involved a strife between those\r\nideas and interests of which each was the recognized representative. Those\r\nStates which previously had been severed from each other by geographical\r\nposition and diversity of interests, now rallied under the guidance either\r\nof Athens or Sparta. The intrigues of Themistocles and Pausanias had\r\nprevented that Panhellenic union, so necessary for the full development of\r\npolitical power, and which was for a time promoted by the Persian war.\r\nAthens, in particular, gradually came to regard herself as a pre-eminent\r\npower, to which the other States were to be tributary. Her empire, based\r\non maritime supremacy, became a tyranny to which it was hard for the old\r\nallies to submit.\r\n\r\n(M457) But the rivalry between Sparta and Athens was still more marked.\r\nSparta had thus far taken the lead among the Grecian States, and Athens\r\nhad submitted to it in the Persian invasion. But the consciousness of new\r\npowers, which naval warfare developed, the _éclat_ of the battles of\r\nMarathon and Salamis, and the confederacy of Delos, changed the relative\r\nposition of the two States. Moreover, to Athens the highest glory of\r\nresisting the Persians was due, while her patriotic and enlarged spirit\r\nfavorably contrasted with the narrow and selfish policy of Sparta.\r\n\r\n(M458) And this policy was seen in nothing more signally than in the\r\noppositions he made to the new fortifications of Athens, so that\r\nThemistocles was obliged to go to Sparta, and cover up by deceit and\r\nfalsehood the fact that the Athenians were really repairing their walls,\r\nwhich they had an undoubted right to do, but which Ægina beheld with fear\r\nand Sparta with jealousy. And this unreasonable meanness and injustice on\r\nthe part of Sparta, again reacted on the Athenians, and created great\r\nbitterness and acrimony.\r\n\r\n(M459) But in spite of the opposition of Sparta, the new fortifications\r\narose, to which all citizens, rich and poor, lent their aid, and on a\r\nscale which was not unworthy of the grandeur of a future capital. The\r\ncircuit of the walls was fifty stadia or seven miles, and they were of\r\nsufficient strength and height to protect the city against external\r\nenemies. And when they were completed Themistocles—a man of great\r\nforesight and genius, persuaded the citizens to fortify also their harbor,\r\nas a means of securing the ascendency of the city in future maritime\r\nconflicts. He foresaw that the political ascendency of Athens was based on\r\nthose “wooden walls” which the Delphic oracle had declared to be her hope\r\nin the Persian invasion. The victory at Salamis had confirmed the wisdom\r\nof the prediction, and given to Athens an imperishable glory. Themistocles\r\npersuaded his countrymen that the open roadstead of Phalerum was insecure,\r\nand induced them to inclose the more spacious harbors of Peireus and\r\nMunychia, by a wall as long as that which encircled Athens itself,—so\r\nthick and high that all assault should be hopeless, while within its\r\nfortifications the combined fleets of Greece could safely he anchored, and\r\nto which the citizens of Athens could also retire in extreme danger.\r\nPeireus accordingly was inclosed at vast expense and labor by a wall\r\nfourteen feet in thickness, which served not merely for a harbor, but a\r\ndock-yard and arsenal. Thither resorted metics or resident foreigners, and\r\nmuch of the trade of Athens was in their hands, since they were less\r\nfrequently employed in foreign service. They became a thrifty population\r\nof traders and handy craftsmen identified with the prosperity of Athens.\r\nThese various works, absorbed much of the Athenian force and capital, yet\r\nenough remained to build annually twenty new triremes—equivalent to our\r\nmodern ships of the line. Athens now became the acknowledged head and\r\nleader of the allied States, instead of Sparta, whose authority as a\r\npresiding State was now openly renunciated by the Athenians. The\r\nPanhellenic union under Sparta was now broken forever, and two rival\r\nStates disputed the supremacy,—the maritime States adhering to Athens, and\r\nthe land States, which furnished the larger part of the army at Platæa,\r\nadhering to Sparta. It was then that the confederacy of Delos was formed,\r\nunder the presidency of Athens, which Aristides directed. His assessment\r\nwas so just and equitable that no jealousies were excited, and the four\r\nhundred and sixty talents which were collected from the maritime States\r\nwere kept at Delos for the common benefit of the league, managed by a\r\nboard of Athenian officers. It was a common fear which led to this great\r\ncontribution, for the Phœnician fleet might at any time reappear, and,\r\nco-operating with a Persian land force, destroy the liberties of Greece.\r\nAlthough Athens reaped the chief benefit of this league, it was\r\nessentially national. It was afterward indeed turned to aggrandize Athens,\r\nbut, when it was originally made, was a means of common defense against a\r\npower as yet unconquered though repulsed.\r\n\r\n(M460) During all the time that the fortifications of Athens and the\r\nPeireus were being made, Themistocles was the ruling spirit at Athens,\r\nwhile Aristides commanded the fleet and organized the confederacy of\r\nDelos. It was thus several years before he became false to his Countrymen,\r\nand the change was only gradually wrought in his character, owing chiefly\r\nto his extravagant habits and the arrogance which so often attends\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n(M461) During this period, a change was also made in the civil\r\nconstitution of Athens. All citizens were rendered admissible to office.\r\nThe State became still more democratic. The archons were withdrawn from\r\nmilitary duties, and confined to civil functions. The stategi or generals\r\ngained greater power with the extending political relations, and upon them\r\nwas placed the duty of superintending foreign affairs. Athens became more\r\ndemocratical and more military at the same time.\r\n\r\n(M462) From this time, 479 B.C., we date the commencement of the Athenian\r\nempire. It gradually was cemented by circumstances rather than a\r\nlong-sighted and calculating ambition. At the head of the confederacy of\r\nDelos, opportunities were constantly presented of centralizing power,\r\nwhile its rapid increase of population and wealth favored the schemes\r\nwhich political leaders advanced for its aggrandizement. The first ten\r\nyears of the Athenian hegemony or headship were years of active warfare\r\nagainst the Persians. The capture of Eion, on the Strymon, with its\r\nPersian garrison, by Cimonon, led to the settlement of Amphipolis by the\r\nAthenians; and the fall of the cities which the Persians had occupied in\r\nThrace and in the various islands of the Ægean increased the power of\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\n(M463) The confederate States at last grew weary of personal military\r\nservice, and prevailed upon the Athenians to provide ships and men in\r\ntheir place, for which they imposed upon themselves a suitable\r\nmoney-payment. They thus gradually sunk to the condition of tributary\r\nallies, unwarlike and averse to privation, while the Athenians, stimulated\r\nby new and expanding ambition, became more and more enterprising and\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\n(M464) But with the growth of Athens was also the increase of jealousies.\r\nAthens became unpopular, not only because she made the different maritime\r\nStates her tributaries, but because she embarked in war against them to\r\nsecure a still greater aggrandizement. Naxos revolted, but was conquered,\r\nB.C. 467. The confederate State was stripped of its navy, and its\r\nfortifications were razed to the ground. Next year the island of Thasos\r\nlikewise seceded from the alliance, and was subdued with difficulty, and\r\ncame near involving Athens in a war with Sparta. The Thasians invoked the\r\naid of Sparta, which was promised though not fulfilled, which imbittered\r\nthe relations between the two leading Grecian States.\r\n\r\n(M465) During this period, from the formation of the league at Delos, and\r\nthe fall of Thasos, about thirteen years, Athens was occupied in\r\nmaintaining expeditions against Persia, being left free from\r\nembarrassments in Attica. The towns of Platæa and Thespiæ were restored\r\nand repeopled under Athenian influence.\r\n\r\n(M466) The jealousy of Sparta, in view of the growing power of Athens, at\r\nlast gave vent in giving aid to Thebes, against the old policy of the\r\nState, to enable that city to maintain supremacy over the lesser Bœotian\r\ntowns. The Spartans even aided in enlarging her circuit and improving her\r\nfortifications, which aid made Thebes a vehement partisan of Sparta. Soon\r\nafter, a terrible earthquake happened in Sparta, 464 B.C., which calamity\r\nwas seized upon by the Helots as a fitting occasion for revolt. Defeated,\r\nbut not subdued, the insurgents retreated to Ithome, the ancient citadel\r\nof their Messenian ancestors, and there intrenched themselves. The\r\nSpartans spent two years in an unsuccessful siege, and were forced to\r\nappeal to their allies for assistance. But even the increased force made\r\nno impression on the fortified hill, so ignorant were the Greeks, at this\r\nperiod, of the art of attacking walls. And when the Athenians, under\r\nCimon, still numbered among the allies of Sparta, were not more\r\nsuccessful, their impatience degenerated to mistrust and suspicion, and\r\nsummarily dismissed the Athenian contingent. This ungracious and jealous\r\ntreatment exasperated the Athenians, whose feelings were worked upon by\r\nPericles who had opposed the policy of sending troops at all to Laconia.\r\nCimon here was antagonistic to Pericles, and wished to cement the more\r\ncomplete union of Greece against Persia, and maintain the union with\r\nSparta. Cimon, moreover, disliked the democratic policy of Pericles. But\r\nthe Athenians rallied under Pericles, and Cimon lost his influence, which\r\nhad been paramount since the disgrace of Themistocles. A formal resolution\r\nwas passed at Athens to renounce the alliance with Sparta against the\r\nPersians, and to seek alliance with Argos, which had been neutral during\r\nthe Persian invasion, but which had regained something of its ancient\r\nprestige and power by the conquest of Mycenæ and other small towns. The\r\nThessalians became members of this new alliance which was intended to be\r\nantagonistic to Sparta. Megara, shortly after, renounced the protection of\r\nthe Peloponnesian capital, and was enrolled among the allies of Athens,—a\r\ngreat acquisition to Athenian power, since this city secured the passes of\r\nMount Gerania, so that Attica was protected from invasion by the Isthmus\r\nof Corinth. But the alliance of Megara and Athens gave deep umbrage to\r\nCorinth as well as Sparta, and a war with Corinth was the result, in which\r\nÆgina was involved as the ally of Sparta and Corinth.\r\n\r\n(M467) The Athenians were at first defeated on the land; but this defeat\r\nwas more than overbalanced by a naval victory over the Dorian seamen, off\r\nthe island of Ægina, by which the naval force of _Ægina_ hitherto great,\r\nwas forever prostrated. The Athenians captured seventy ships and commenced\r\nthe siege of the city itself. Sparta would have come to the rescue, but\r\nwas preoccupied in suppressing the insurrection of the Helots. Corinth\r\nsent three hundred hoplites to Ægina and attacked Megara. But the\r\nAthenians prevailed both at Ægina and Megara, which was a great blow to\r\nCorinth.\r\n\r\n(M468) Fearing, however, a renewed attack from Corinth and the\r\nPeloponnesian States, now full of rivalry and enmity, the Athenians, under\r\nthe leadership of Pericles, resolved to connect their city with the harbor\r\nof Peireus by a long wall—a stupendous undertaking at that time. It\r\nexcited the greatest alarm among the enemies of Athens, and was a subject\r\nof contention among different parties in the city. The party which Cimon,\r\nnow ostracised, had headed, wished to cement the various Grecian States in\r\na grand alliance against the Persians, and dreaded to see this long wall\r\narise as a standing menace against the united power of the Peloponnesus.\r\nMoreover, the aristocrats of Athens disliked a closer amalgamation with\r\nthe maritime people of the Peireus, as well as the burdens and taxes which\r\nthis undertaking involved. These fortifications doubtless increased the\r\npower of Athens, but weakened the unity of Hellenic patriotism; and\r\nincreased those jealousies which ultimately proved the political ruin of\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n(M469) Under the influence of these rivalries and jealousies the\r\nLacedæmonians, although the Helots wore not subdued, undertook a hostile\r\nexpedition out of the Peloponnesus, with eleven thousand five hundred men,\r\nostensibly to protect Doris against the Phœcians, but really to prevent\r\nthe further aggrandizement of Athens, and this was supposed to be most\r\neasily effected by strengthening Thebes and securing the obedience of the\r\nBœotian cities. But there was yet another design, to prevent the building\r\nof the long walls, to which the aristocratical party of Athens was\r\nopposed, but which Pericles, with long-sighted views, defended.\r\n\r\n(M470) This extraordinary man, with whom the glory and greatness of Athens\r\nare so intimately associated, now had the ascendency over all his rivals.\r\nHe is considered the ablest of all the statesmen which Greece produced. He\r\nwas of illustrious descent, and spent the early part of his life in\r\nretirement and study, and when he emerged from obscurity his rise was\r\nrapid, until he gained the control of his countrymen, which he retained\r\nuntil his death. He took the side of the democracy, and, in one sense, was\r\na demagogue, as well as a statesman, since he appealed to popular passions\r\nand interests. He was very eloquent, and was the idol of the party which\r\nwas dominant in the State. His rank and fortune enabled him to avail\r\nhimself of every mode of culture and self-improvement known in his day. He\r\nloved music, philosophy, poetry, and art. The great Anaxagoras gave a\r\nnoble direction to his studies, so that he became imbued with the\r\nsublimest ideas of Grecian wisdom. And his eloquence is said to have been\r\nof the most lofty kind. His manners partook of the same exalted and\r\ndignified bearing as his philosophy. He never lost his temper, and\r\nmaintained the severest self-control. His voice was sweet, and his figure\r\nwas graceful and commanding. He early distinguished himself as a soldier,\r\nand so gained upon his countrymen that, when Themistocles and Aristides\r\nwere dead, and Cimon engaged in military expeditions, he supplanted all\r\nwho had gone before him in popular favor. All his sympathies were with the\r\ndemocratic party, while his manners and habits and tastes and associations\r\nwere those of the aristocracy. His political career lasted forty years\r\nfrom the year 469 B.C. He was unremitting in his public duties, and was\r\nnever seen in the streets unless on his way to the assembly or senate. He\r\nwas not fond of convivial pleasures, and was, though affable, reserved and\r\ndignified. He won the favor of the people by a series of measures which\r\nprovided the poor with amusement and means of subsistence. He caused those\r\nwho served in the courts to be paid for their attendance and services. He\r\nweakened the power of the court of the Areopagus, which was opposed to\r\npopular measures. Assured of his own popularity, he even contrived to\r\nsecure the pardon of Cimon, his great rival, when publicly impeached.\r\n\r\n(M471) Pericles was thus the leading citizen of his country, when he\r\nadvocated the junction of the Peireus with Athens by the long walls which\r\nhave been alluded to, and when the Spartan army in Bœotia threatened to\r\nsustain the oligarchal party in the city. The Athenians, in view of this\r\ndanger, took decisive measures. They took the field at once against their\r\nold allies, the Lacedæmonians. The unfortunate battle of Tanagra was\r\ndecided in favor of the Spartans, chiefly through the desertion of the\r\nThessalian horse.\r\n\r\n(M472) Cimon, though ostracised, appeared in the field of battle, and\r\nrequested permission to fight in the ranks. Though the request was\r\nrefused, he used all his influence with his friends to fight with bravery\r\nand fidelity to his country’s cause, which noble conduct allayed the\r\nexisting jealousies, and through the influence of Pericles, his banishment\r\nof ten years was revoked. He returned to Athens, reconciled with the party\r\nwhich had defeated him, and so great was the admiration of his magnanimity\r\nthat all parties generously united in the common cause. Another battle\r\nwith the enemy was fought in Bœotia, this time attended with success, the\r\nresult of which was the complete ascendency of the Athenians over all\r\nBœotia. They became masters of Thebes and all the neighboring towns, and\r\nreversed all the acts of the Spartans, and established democratic\r\ngovernments, and forced the aristocratical leaders into exile. Phocis and\r\nLocris were added to the list of dependent allies, and the victory\r\ncemented their power from the Corinthian Gulf to the strait of Thermopylæ.\r\n\r\n(M473) Then followed the completion of the long walls, B.C. 455, and the\r\nconquest of Ægina. Athens was now mistress of the sea, and her admiral\r\ndisplayed his strength by sailing round the Peloponnesus, and taking\r\npossession of many cities in the Gulf of Corinth. But the Athenians were\r\nunsuccessful in an expedition into Thessaly, and sustained many losses in\r\nEgypt in the great warfare with Persia.\r\n\r\n(M474) After the success of the Lacedæmonians at Tanagra they made no\r\nexpeditions out of the Peloponnesus for several years, and allowed Bœotia\r\nand Phocis to be absorbed in the Athenian empire. They even extended the\r\ntruce with Athens for five years longer, and this was promoted by Cimon,\r\nwho wished to resume offensive operations against the Persians. Cimon was\r\nallowed to equip a fleet of two hundred triremes and set sail to Cyprus,\r\nwhere he died. The expedition failed under his successor, and this closed\r\nall further aggressive war with the Persians.\r\n\r\n(M475) The death of Cimon, whose interest it was to fight the Persians,\r\nand thus by the spoils and honors of war keep up his influence at home,\r\nleft Pericles without rivals, and with opportunities to develop his policy\r\nof internal improvements, and the development of national resources, to\r\nenable Athens to maintain her ascendency over the States of Greece. So he\r\ngladly concluded peace with the Persians, by the terms of which they were\r\nexcluded from the coasts of Asia Minor and the islands of the Ægean; while\r\nAthens stipulated to make no further aggression on Cyprus, Phœnicia,\r\nCilicia, and Egypt.\r\n\r\n(M476) Athens, at peace with all her enemies, with a large empire of\r\ntributary allies, a great fleet, and large accumulations of treasure,\r\nsought now to make herself supreme in Greece. The fund of the confederacy\r\nof Delos was transferred to the Acropolis. New allies sought her alliance.\r\nIt is said the tributary cities amounted to one thousand. She was not only\r\nmistress of the sea, but she was the equal of Sparta on the land. Beside\r\nthis political power, a vast treasure was accumulated in the Acropolis.\r\nSuch rapid aggrandizement was bitterly felt by Corinth, Sicyon, and\r\nSparta, and the feeling of enmity expanded until it exploded in the\r\nPeloponnesian war.\r\n\r\n(M477) It was while Athena was at this height of power and renown that\r\nfurther changes were made in the constitution by Pericles. Great authority\r\nwas still in the hands of the court of the Areopagus, which was composed\r\nexclusively of ex-archons, sitting for life, and hence of very\r\naristocratic sentiments. It was indeed a judicial body, but its functions\r\nwere mixed; it decided all disputes, inquired into crimes, and inflicted\r\npunishments. And it was enabled to enforce its own mandates, which were\r\nwithout appeal, and led to great injustice and oppression. The\r\nmagistrates, serving without pay, were generally wealthy, and though their\r\noffices were eligible to all the citizens, still, practically, only the\r\nrich became magistrates, as is the case with the British House of Commons.\r\nHence, magistrates possessing large powers, and the senate sitting for\r\nlife, all belonging to the wealthy class, were animated by aristocratic\r\nsympathies. But a rapidly increasing democracy succeeded in securing the\r\nselection of archons by lot, in place of election. This threw more popular\r\nelements into the court of Areopagus. The innovations which Pericles\r\neffected, of causing the jury courts, or Dikasteries, to be regularly\r\npaid, again threw into public life the poorer citizens. But the great\r\nchange which he effected was in transferring to the numerous dikasts,\r\nselected from the citizens, a new judicial power, heretofore exercised by\r\nthe magistrates, and the senate of the Areopagus. The magistrate, instead\r\nof deciding causes and inflicting punishment beyond the imposition of a\r\nsmall fine, was constrained to impanel a jury to try the cause. In fact,\r\nthe ten dikasts became the leading judicial tribunals, and as these were\r\ncomposed, each, of five hundred citizens, judgments were virtually made by\r\nthe people, instead of the old court. The pay of each man serving as a\r\njuror was determined and punctually paid. The importance of this\r\nrevolution will be seen when these dikasts thus became the exclusive\r\nassemblies, of course popular, in which all cases, civil and criminal,\r\nwere tried. The magistrates were thus deprived of the judicial functions\r\nwhich they once enjoyed, and were confined to purely administrative\r\nmatters. The commanding functions of the archon were destroyed, and he\r\nonly retained power to hear complaints, and fix the day of trial, and\r\npreside over the dikastic assembly. The senate of the Areopagus, which had\r\nexercised an inquisitorial power over the lives and habits of the\r\ncitizens, and supervised the meetings of the assembly—a power uncertain\r\nbut immense, and sustained by ancient customs,—now became a mere nominal\r\ntribunal. And this change was called for, since the members of the court\r\nwere open to bribery and corruption, and had abused their powers, little\r\nshort of paternal despotism. And when the great public improvements, the\r\ngrowth of a new population, the rising importance of the Penæus, the\r\nintroduction of nautical people, and the active duties of Athens as the\r\nhead of the Delian confederacy—all, together, gave force to the democratic\r\nelements of society, the old and conservative court became stricter, and\r\nmore oppressive, instead of more popular and conciliatory.\r\n\r\n(M478) But beside this great change in the constitution, Pericles effected\r\nothers also. Under his influence, a general power of supervision, over the\r\nmagistrates and the assembly, was intrusted to seven men called\r\nNomophylakes, or Law Guardians, changed every year, who sat with the\r\npresident in the senate and assembly, and interposed when any step was\r\ntaken contrary to existing laws. Other changes were also effected with a\r\nview to the enforcement of laws, upon which we can not enter. It is enough\r\nto say that it was by means of Pericles that the magistrates were stripped\r\nof judicial power, and the Areopagus of all its jurisdiction, except in\r\ncases of homicide, and numerous and paid and popular dikasts were\r\nsubstituted to decide judicial cases, and repeal and enact laws; this,\r\nsays Grote, was the consummation of the Athenian democracy. And thus it\r\nremained until the time of Demosthenes.\r\n\r\n(M479) But the influence of Pericles is still more memorable from the\r\nimpulse he gave to the improvements of Athens and his patronage of art and\r\nletters. He conceived the idea of investing his city with intellectual\r\nglory, which is more permanent than any conquests of territory. And since\r\nhe could not make Athens the centre of political power, owing to the\r\njealousies of other States, he resolved to make her the great attraction\r\nto all scholars, artists, and strangers. And his countrymen were prepared\r\nto second his glorious objects, and were in a condition to do so, enriched\r\nby commerce, rendered independent by successes over the Persians, and\r\njealous Grecian rivals, and stimulated by the poets and philosophers who\r\nflourished in that glorious age. The age of Pericles is justly regarded as\r\nthe epoch of the highest creation genius ever exhibited, and gave to\r\nAthens an intellectual supremacy which no military genius could have\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n(M480) The Persian war despoiled and depopulated Athens. The city was\r\nrebuilt on a more extensive plan, and the streets were made more regular.\r\nThe long walls to the Peiræus were completed—a double wall, as it were,\r\nwith a space between them large enough to secure the communication between\r\nthe city and the port, in case an enemy should gain a footing in the wide\r\nspace between the Peiræan and Thaleric walls. The port itself was\r\nornamented with beautiful public buildings, of which the Agora was the\r\nmost considerable. The theatre, called the Odeon, was erected in Athens\r\nfor musical and poetical contests. The Acropolis, with its temples, was\r\nrebuilt, and the splendid Propylæa, of Doric architecture, formed a\r\nmagnificent approach to them. The temple of Athenæ—the famous\r\nParthenon—was built of white marble, and adorned with sculptures in the\r\npediments and frieze by the greatest artists of antiquity, while Phidias\r\nconstructed the statue of the goddess of ivory and gold. No Doric temple\r\never equaled the severe proportions and chaste beauty of the Parthenon,\r\nand its ruins still are one of the wonders of the world. The Odeon and\r\nParthenon were finished during the first seven years of the administration\r\nof Pericles, and many other temples were constructed in various parts of\r\nAttica. The genius of Phidias is seen in the numerous sculptures which\r\nornamented the city, and the general impulse he gave to art. Other great\r\nartists labored in generous competition,—sculptors, painters, and\r\narchitects,—to make Athens the most beautiful city in the world.\r\n\r\n(M481) “It was under the administration of Pericles that Greek literature\r\nreached its culminating height in the Attic drama, a form of poetry which\r\nAristotle justly considers as the most perfect; and it shone with\r\nundiminished splendor to the close of the century. It was this branch of\r\nliterature which peculiarly marked the age of Pericles—the period between\r\nthe Persian and Peloponnesian wars. The first regular comedies were\r\nproduced by Epicharmus, who was born in Cos, B.C. 540, and exhibited at\r\nSyracuse. Comedy arose before tragedy, and was at first at the celebration\r\nof Dionysus by rustic revelers in the season of the vintage, in the form\r\nof songs and dances. But these were not so appropriate in cities, and the\r\nsongs of the revelers were gradually molded into the regular choral\r\ndithyramb, while the performers still preserved the wild dress and\r\ngestures of the satyrs—half goat and half man—who accompanied Dionysus.”\r\nThe prevalence of tales of crime and fate and suffering naturally\r\nimpressed spectators with tragic sentiments, and tragedy was thus born and\r\nseparated from comedy. Both forms received their earliest development in\r\nthe Dorian States, and were particularly cultivated by the Megarians.\r\n“Thespis, a native of Icaria, first gave to tragedy its dramatic\r\ncharacter, in the time of Pisistratus, B.C. 535. He introduced the\r\ndialogue, relieved by choral performances, and the recitation of\r\nmythological and heroic adventures. He traveled about Attica in a wagon,\r\nwhich served him for a stage; but the art soon found its way to Athens,\r\nwhere dramatic contests for prizes were established in connection with the\r\nfestivals of Dionysus. These became State institutions. Chœrilus, B.C.\r\n523, and Phrynichus followed Thespis, and these ventured from the regions\r\nof mythology to contemporaneous history.”\r\n\r\n(M482) It was at this time that Æschylus, the father of tragedy, exhibited\r\nhis dramas at Athens, B.C. 500. He added a second actor, and made the\r\nchoral odes subordinate to the action. The actors now made use of masks,\r\nand wore lofty head-dresses and magnificent robes. Scenes were painted\r\naccording to the rules of perspective, and an elaborate mechanism was\r\nintroduced upon the stage. New figures were invented for the dancers of\r\nthe chorus. Sophocles still further improved tragedy by adding the third\r\nactor, and snatched from Æschylus the tragic prize. He was not equal to\r\nÆschylus in the boldness and originality of his characters, or the\r\nloftiness of his sentiments, or the colossal grandeur of his figures; but\r\nin the harmony of his composition, and the grace and vigor displayed in\r\nall the parts—the severe unity, the classic elegance of his style, and the\r\ncharm of his expressions he is his superior. These two men carried tragedy\r\nto a degree of perfection never afterward attained in Greece. It was not\r\nmerely a spectacle to the people, but was applied to moral and religious\r\npurposes. The heroes of Æschylus are raised above the sphere of real life,\r\nand often they are the sport of destiny, or victims of a struggle between\r\nsuperior beings. The characters of Sophocles are rarely removed beyond the\r\nsphere of mortal sympathy, and they are made to rebuke injustice and give\r\nimpressive warnings.\r\n\r\n(M483) Comedy also made a great stride during the administration of\r\nPericles; but it was not till his great ascendency was at its height that\r\nAristophanes was born, B.C. 444. The comedians of the time were allowed\r\ngreat license, which they carried even into politics, and which was\r\ndirected against Pericles himself.\r\n\r\n(M484) The Athenian stage at this epoch was the chief means by which\r\nnational life and liberty were sustained. It answered the functions of the\r\npress and the pulpit in our day, and quickened the perceptions of the\r\npeople. The great audiences which assembled at the theatres were kindled\r\ninto patriotic glow, and were moved by the noble thoughts, and withering\r\nsarcasm, and inexhaustible wit of the poets. “The gods and goddesses who\r\nswept majestically over the tragic stage were the objects of religious and\r\nnational faith, real beings, whose actions and sufferings claimed their\r\ndeepest sympathy, and whose heroic fortitude served for an example, or\r\ntheir terrific fate for a warning. So, too, in the old comedy, the\r\npersons, habits, manners, principles held up to ridicule were all familiar\r\nto the audience in their daily lives; and the poet might exhibit in a\r\nhumorous light objects which to attack seriously would have been a treason\r\nor a sacrilege, and might recommend measures which he could only have\r\nproposed in the popular assembly with a halter round his neck.” This\r\nsusceptibility of the people to grand impressions, and the toleration of\r\nrulers, alike show a great degree of popular intelligence and a great\r\npractical liberty in social life.\r\n\r\n(M485) The age of Pericles was also adorned by great historians and\r\nphilosophers. Herodotus and Thucydides have never been surpassed as\r\nhistorians, while the Sophists who succeeded the more earnest philosophers\r\nof a previous age, gave to Athenian youth a severe intellectual training.\r\nRhetoric, mathematics and natural history supplanted speculation, led to\r\nthe practice of eloquence as an art, and gave to society polish and\r\nculture. The Sophists can not indeed be compared with those great men who\r\npreceded or succeeded them in philosophical wisdom, but their influence in\r\neducating the Grecian mind, and creating polished men of society, can not\r\nbe disproved. Politics became a profession in the democratic State, which\r\ndemanded the highest culture, and an extensive acquaintance with the\r\nprinciples of moral and political science. This was the age of lectures,\r\nwhen students voluntarily assembled to learn from the great masters of\r\nthought that knowledge which would enable them to rise in a State where\r\nthe common mind was well instructed.\r\n\r\n(M486) But it must also be admitted that while the age of Pericles\r\nfurnished an extraordinary stimulus to the people, in art, in literature,\r\nin political science, and in popular institutions, the great teachers of\r\nthe day inculcated a selfish morality, and sought an æsthetic enjoyment\r\nirrespective of high moral improvement, and the inevitable result was the\r\nrapid degeneracy of Athens, and the decline even in political influence,\r\nand strength, as was seen in the superior power of Sparta in the great\r\ncontest to which the two leading States of Greece were hurried by their\r\njealousies and animosities. The prosperity was delusive and outside; for\r\nno intellectual triumph, no glories of art, no fascinations of literature,\r\ncan balance the moral forces which are generated in self-denial and lofty\r\npublic virtue.\r\n\r\n(M487) It was while the power and glory of Pericles were at their height\r\nthat he formed that memorable attachment to Aspasia, a Milesian woman,\r\nwhich furnished a fruitful subject for the attacks of the comic poets. She\r\nwas the most brilliant and intellectual woman of the age, and her house\r\nwas the resort of the literary men and philosophers and artists of Athens\r\nuntil the death of Pericles. He formed as close a union with her as the\r\nlaw allowed, and her influence in creating a sympathy with intellectual\r\nexcellence can not be questioned. But she was charged with pandering to\r\nthe vices of Pericles, and corrupting society by her example and\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n(M488) The latter years of Pericles were marked by the outbreak of that\r\ngreat war with Sparta, which crippled the power of Athens and tarnished\r\nher glories. He also was afflicted by the death of his children by the\r\nplague which devastated Athens in the early part of the Peloponnesian war,\r\nto which attention is now directed. The probity of Pericles is attested by\r\nthe fact that during his long administration he added nothing to his\r\npatrimonial estate. His policy was ambitious, and if it could have been\r\ncarried out, it would have been wise. He sought first to develop the\r\nresources of his country—the true aim of all enlightened statesmen—and\r\nthen to make Athens the centre of Grecian civilization and political\r\npower, to which all other Stales would be secondary and subservient. But\r\nthe rivalries of the Grecian States and inextinguishable jealousies would\r\nnot allow this. He made Athens, indeed, the centre of cultivated life; he\r\ncould not make it the centre of national unity. In attempting this he\r\nfailed, and a disastrous war was the consequence.\r\n\r\nPericles lived long enough to see the commencement of the contest which\r\nultimately resulted in the political ruin of Athens, and which we now\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M489) The great and disastrous war between the two leading States of\r\nGreece broke out about two years and a half before the death of Pericles,\r\nbut the causes of the war can be traced to a period shortly after the\r\nPersians were driven out of the Ionian cities. It arose primarily from the\r\nrapid growth and power of Athens, when, as the leader of the maritime\r\nStates, it excited the envy of Sparta and other republics. A thirty years’\r\ntruce was made between Athens and Sparta, B.C. 445, after the revolution\r\nin Bœotia, when the ascendency of Pericles was undisputed, which forced\r\nhis rival, Thucydides, a kinsman of Cimon, to go into temporary exile. The\r\ncontinuance of the truce is identical with the palmy days of Athens, and\r\nthe glory of Pericles, during which the vast improvements to the city were\r\nmade, and art and literature flourished to a degree unprecedented in the\r\nhistory of the ancient world.\r\n\r\n(M490) After the conquest of Samos the jealousy of Sparta reached a point\r\nwhich made it obvious that the truce could not much longer be maintained,\r\nthough both powers shrunk from open hostilities, foreseeing the calamities\r\nwhich would result. The storm burst out in an unexpected quarter. The city\r\nof Epidamnus had been founded by colonists from Corcyra, on the eastern\r\nside of the Adriatic. It was, however, the prey of domestic factions, and\r\nin a domestic revolution a part of the inhabitants became exiles. These\r\nappealed to the neighboring barbarians, who invested the city by sea and\r\nland. The city, in distress, invoked the aid of Corcyra, the parent State,\r\nwhich aid being disregarded, the city transferred its allegiance to\r\nCorinth. The Corinthians, indulging a hatred of Corcyra, took the\r\ndistressed city under their protection. This led to a war between Corcyra\r\nand Corinth, in which the Corinthians were defeated. But Corinth, burning\r\nto revenge the disaster, fitted out a still larger force against Corcyra.\r\nThe Corcyræans, in alarm, then sent envoys to Athens to come to their\r\nassistance. The Corinthians also sent ambassadors to frustrate their\r\nproposal. Two assemblies were held in Athens in reference to the subject.\r\nThe delegates of Corcyra argued that peace could not long be maintained\r\nwith Sparta, and that in the coming contest the Corcyræans would prove\r\nuseful allies. The envoys of Corinth, on the other hand, maintained that\r\nAthens could not lend aid to Corcyra without violating the treaty with\r\nCorinth. The Athenians decided to assist Corcyra, and ten ships were sent,\r\nunder the command of Lacedæmonieus, the son of Cimon. This was considered\r\na breach of faith by the Corinthians, and a war resulted between Corinth\r\nand Athens. The Corinthians then invited the Lacedæmonians to join them\r\nand make common cause against an aggressive and powerful enemy, that aimed\r\nat the supremacy of Greece. In spite of the influence of Athenian envoys\r\nin Sparta, who attempted to justify the course their countrymen had taken,\r\nthe feeling against Athens was bitter and universally hostile. Instant\r\nhostilities were demanded in defense of the allies of Sparta, and war was\r\ndecided upon.\r\n\r\nThus commenced the Peloponnesian war, which led to such disastrous\r\nconsequences, and which was thus brought about by the Corinthians, B.C.\r\n433, sixteen years before the conclusion of the truce.\r\n\r\n(M491) To Athens the coming war was any thing but agreeable. It had no\r\nhopes of gain, and the certainty of prodigious loss. But the Spartans were\r\nnot then prepared for the contest, and hostilities did not immediately\r\ncommence. They contented themselves, at first, with sending envoys to\r\nAthens to multiply demands and enlarge the grounds of quarrel. The\r\noffensive was plainly with Sparta. The first requisition which Sparta made\r\nwas the expulsion of the Alcmæonidæ from Athens, to which family Pericles\r\nbelonged—a mere political manœuvre to get rid of so commanding a\r\nstatesman. The enemies of Pericles, especially the comic actors at Athens,\r\nseized this occasion to make public attacks upon him, and it was then that\r\nthe persecution of Aspasia took place, as well as that against Anaxagoras,\r\nthe philosopher, the teacher, and friend of Pericles. He was also accused\r\nof peculation in complicity with Phidias. But he was acquitted of the\r\nvarious charges made by his enemies. Nor could his services be well\r\ndispensed with in the great crisis of public affairs, even had he been\r\nguilty, as was exceedingly doubtful.\r\n\r\n(M492) The reluctance on the part of the Athenians to go to war was very\r\ngreat, but Pericles strenuously urged his countrymen to resent the\r\noutrageous demands of Sparta, which were nothing less than the virtual\r\nextinction of the Athenian empire. He showed that the Spartans, though\r\nall-powerful on the Peloponnesus, had no means of carrying on an\r\naggressive war at a distance, neither leaders nor money, nor habits of\r\nconcert with allies; while Athens was mistress of the sea, and was\r\nimpregnable in defense; that great calamities would indeed happen in\r\nAttica, but even if overrun by Spartan armies, there were other\r\nterritories and islands from which a support could be derived. “Mourn not\r\nfor the loss of land,” said the orator, “but reserve your mourning for the\r\nmen that acquire land.” His eloquence and patriotism prevailed with a\r\nmajority of the assembly, and answer was made to Sparta that the Athenians\r\nwere prepared to discuss all grounds of complaint pursuant to the truce,\r\nby arbitration, but that they would yield nothing to authoritative\r\ncommand. This closed the negotiations, which Pericles foresaw would be\r\nvain and useless, since the Spartans were obstinately bent on war. The\r\nfirst imperious blow was struck by the Thebans—allies of Sparta. They\r\nsurprised Platæa in the night. The gates were opened by the oligarchal\r\nparty; a party of Thebans were admitted into the agora; but the people\r\nrallied, and the party was overwhelmed. Meanwhile another detachment of\r\nThebans arrived in the morning, and, discovering what had happened, they\r\nlaid waste the Platæan territory without the walls. The Platæans\r\nretaliated by slaughtering their prisoners. Messengers left the city, on\r\nthe entrance of the Thebans, to carry the news to Athens, and the\r\nAthenians issued orders to seize all the Bœotians who could be found in\r\nAttica, and sent re-enforcements to Platæa. This aggression of the Thebans\r\nsilenced the opponents of Pericles, who now saw that the war had actually\r\nbegun, and that active preparations should be made. Athens immediately\r\nsent messengers to her allies, tributary as well as free, and\r\ncontributions flowed in from all parts of the Athenian empire. Athens had\r\nsoon three hundred triremes fit for service, twelve hundred horsemen,\r\nsixteen hundred bowmen, and twenty-nine thousand hoplites. The Acropolis\r\nwas filled with the treasure which had long been accumulating, not less\r\nthan six thousand talents—about $7,000,000 of our money—an immense sum at\r\nthat time, when gold and silver were worth twenty or thirty times as much\r\nas at present. Moreover, the various temples were rich in votive\r\nofferings, in deposits, plate, and sacred vessels, while the great statue\r\nof the goddess, lately set up in the Parthenon by Phidias, composed of\r\ngold and ivory, was itself valued at four hundred talents. The\r\ncontributions of allies swelled the resources of Athens to one thousand\r\ntalents, or over $11,000,000.\r\n\r\n(M493) Sparta, on the other hand, had but few ships, no funds, and no\r\npowers of combination, and it would seem that success would be on the side\r\nof Athens, with her unrivaled maritime skill, and the unanimity of the\r\ncitizens. Pericles did not promise successful engagements on the land, but\r\na successful resistance, and the maintenance of the empire. His policy was\r\npurely defensive. But if Sparta was weak in money and ships, she was rich\r\nin allies. The entire strength of the Peloponnesus was brought out,\r\nassisted by Megarians, Bœotians, Phocians, Locrians, and other States.\r\nCorinth, Megara, Sicyon, Elis, and other maritime cities furnished ships\r\nwhile Bœotians, Phocians, and Locrians furnished cavalry. Not even to\r\nresist the Persian hosts was so large a land force collected, as was now\r\nassembled to destroy the supremacy of Athens. And this great force was\r\nanimated with savage hopes, while the Athenians were not without\r\ndesponding anticipations, for there was little hope of resisting the\r\nSpartans and their allies on the field. The Spartans, moreover, resolved,\r\nby means of their allies, to send a fleet able to cope with that of\r\nAthens, and even were so transported with enmity and jealousy as to lay\r\nschemes for invoking the aid of Persia.\r\n\r\n(M494) The invasion of Attica was the primary object of Sparta and her\r\nallies; and at the appointed time the Lacedæmonian forces were mustered on\r\nthe Isthmus of Corinth, under the command of Archidamus. Envoys were sent\r\nto Athens to summon a surrender, but Pericles would not receive them, nor\r\nallow them to enter the city, upon which the Lacedæmonian army commenced\r\nits march to Attica. It required all the eloquence and tact of Pericles to\r\ninduce the proprietors of Attica to submit to the devastation of their\r\ncultivated territory, and fly with their families and movable property to\r\nAthens or the neighboring islands, without making an effort to resist the\r\ninvaders. But this was the policy of Pericles. He knew he could not\r\ncontend with superior forces on the land. It was hard for the people to\r\nsubmit to the cruel necessity of seeing their farms devastated without\r\nopposition. But they made the sacrifice, and intrenched themselves behind\r\nthe fortifications of Athens. Then was seen the wisdom of the long walls\r\nwhich connected Athens with the Piræus.\r\n\r\n(M495) Meanwhile the Spartan forces—sixty thousand hoplites, advanced\r\nthrough Attica, burning and plundering every thing on their way, and\r\nreached Acharnæ, within seven miles of Athens. The Athenians, pent up\r\nbehind their walls, and seeing the destruction of their property, were\r\neager to go forth and fight, but were dissuaded by Pericles. Then came to\r\nhim the trying hour. He was denounced as the cause of the existing\r\nsufferings, and was reviled as a coward. But nothing disturbed his\r\nequanimity, and he refused even to convene the assembly. As one of the ten\r\ngenerals he had this power; but it was a remarkable thing that the people\r\nshould have respected the democratic constitution so far as to submit,\r\nwhen their assembly would have been justified by the exigency of the\r\ncrisis. But while the Athenians remained inactive behind their walls, the\r\ncavalry was sent out on skirmishing expeditions, and a large fleet was\r\nsent to the Peloponnesus with orders to devastate the country in\r\nretaliation. The Spartans, after having spent thirty or forty days in\r\nAttica, retired for want of provisions. Ægina was also invaded, and the\r\ninhabitants were expelled and sent to the Peloponnesus. Megara was soon\r\nafter invaded by an army under Pericles himself, and its territory was\r\ndevastated—a retribution well deserved, for both Megara and Ægina had been\r\nzealous in kindling the war.\r\n\r\n(M496) Expecting a prolonged struggle, the Athenians now made arrangements\r\nfor putting Attica in permanent defense, both by sea and land, and set\r\napart one thousand talents, out of the treasure of the Acropolis, which\r\nwas not to be used except in certain dangers previously prescribed, and a\r\nlaw was passed making it a capital offense for any citizen to propose its\r\nuse for any other purpose.\r\n\r\n(M497) The first year of the war closed without decisive successes on\r\neither side. The Athenians made a more powerful resistance than was\r\nanticipated. It was supposed they could not hold out against the superior\r\nforces of their enemies more than a year. They had the misfortune to see\r\ntheir territory wasted, and their treasures spent in a war which they\r\nwould gladly have avoided. But, on the other hand, they inflicted nearly\r\nequal damages upon the Peloponnesus, and still remained masters of the\r\nsea. Pericles pronounced a funeral oration on those who had fallen and\r\nstimulated his countrymen to continued resistance, and excited their\r\npatriotic sentiments. Thus far the anticipations of the statesman and\r\norator had been more than realized.\r\n\r\n(M498) The second year of the war opened with another invasion of Attica\r\nby the Spartans and their allies. They inflicted even more injury than in\r\nthe preceding year, but they found the territory deserted, all the\r\npopulation having retired within the defenses of Athens.\r\n\r\n(M499) But a new and unforeseen calamity now fell upon the Athenians, and\r\nagainst which they could not guard. A great pestilence broke out in the\r\ncity, which had already overrun Western Asia. Its progress was rapid and\r\ndestructive, and the overcrowded city was but too favorable for its\r\nravages. Thucydides has left a graphic and mournful account of this\r\npestilence, analogous to the plague of modern times. The victims generally\r\nperished on the seventh or ninth day, and no treatment was efficacious.\r\nThe sufferings and miseries of the people were intense, and the calamity\r\nby many was regarded as resulting from the anger of the gods. The\r\npestilence demoralized the population, who lost courage and fortitude. The\r\nsick were left to take care of themselves. The utmost lawlessness\r\nprevailed. The bonds of law and morality were relaxed, and the thoughtless\r\npeople abandoned themselves to every species of folly and excess, seeking,\r\nin their despair, to seize some brief moments of joy before the hand of\r\ndestiny should fall upon them. For three years did this calamity desolate\r\nAthens, and the loss of life was deplorable, both in the army and among\r\nprivate citizens. Pericles lost both his children and his sister; four\r\nthousand four hundred hoplites died, and a greater part of the horsemen.\r\n\r\n(M500) And yet, amid the devastation which the pestilence inflicted,\r\nPericles led another expedition against the coasts of the Peloponnesus.\r\nBut the soldiers carried infection with them, and a greater part of them\r\ndied of the disease at the siege or blockade of Potidæa. The Athenians\r\nwere nearly distracted by the double ravages of pestilence and war, and\r\nbecame incensed against Pericles, and sent messengers to Sparta to\r\nnegotiate peace. But the Spartans turned a deaf ear, which added to the\r\nbitterness against their heroic leader, whose fortitude and firmness were\r\nnever more effectively manifested. He was accused, and condemned to pay a\r\nfine, and excluded from re-election. Though he was restored to power and\r\nconfidence, his affliction bore heavily upon his exalted nature, and he\r\ndied, B.C. 430, in the early period of the war. He had, indeed, many\r\nenemies, and was hunted down by the comic writers, whose trade it was to\r\nderide all political characters, yet his wisdom, patriotism, eloquence,\r\nand great services are indisputable, and he died, leaving on the whole,\r\nthe greatest name which had ever ennobled the Athenians.\r\n\r\n(M501) The war, of course, languished during the prevalence of the\r\nepidemic, and much injury was done to Athenian commerce by Peloponnesian\r\nprivateers, who put to death all their prisoners. It was then that Sparta\r\nsent envoys to Persia to solicit money and troops against Athens, which\r\nshows that no warfare is so bitter as civil strife, and that no expedients\r\nare too disgraceful not to be made use of, in order to gratify malignant\r\npassions. But the envoys were seized in Thrace by the allies of Athens,\r\nand delivered up to the Athenians, and by them were put to death.\r\n\r\n(M502) In January, B.C. 429, Potidæa surrendered to the Athenian generals,\r\nupon favorable terms, after enduring all the miseries of famine. The fall\r\nof this city cost Athens two thousand talents. The Lacedæmonians, after\r\ntwo years, had accomplished nothing. They had not even relieved Potidæa.\r\n\r\n(M503) On the third year, the Lacedæmonians, instead of ravaging Attica,\r\nmarched to the attack of Platæa. The inhabitants resolved to withstand the\r\nwhole force of the enemies. Archidemus, the Lacedæmonian general,\r\ncommenced the siege, defended only by four hundred native citizens and\r\neighty Athenians. So unskilled were the Greeks in the attack of fortified\r\ncities, that the besiegers made no progress, and were obliged to resort to\r\nblockade. A wall of circumvallation was built around the city, which was\r\nnow left to the operations of famine.\r\n\r\n(M504) At the same time the siege was pressed, an Athenian armament was\r\nsent to Thrace, which was defeated; but in the western part of Greece the\r\nAthenian arms were more successful. The Spartans and their allies suffered\r\na repulse at Stratus, and their fleet was defeated by Phormio, the\r\nAthenian admiral. Nothing could exceed the rage of the Lacedæmonians at\r\nthese two disasters. They collected a still larger fleet, and were again\r\ndefeated with severe loss near Naupactus, by inferior forces. But the\r\ndefeated Lacedæmonians, under the persuasion of the Megarians, undertook\r\nthe bold enterprise of surprising the Piræus, during the absence of the\r\nAthenian fleet; but the courage of the assailants failed at the critical\r\nhour, and the port of Athens was saved. The Athenians then had the\r\nprecaution to extend a chain across the mouth of the harbor, to guard\r\nagainst such surprises in the future.\r\n\r\n(M505) Athens, during the summer, had secured the alliance of the\r\nOdrysians, a barbarous but powerful nation in Thrace. Their king,\r\nSitalces, with an army of fifteen thousand men, attacked Perdiccas, the\r\nking of Macedonia, and overran his country, and only retired from the\r\nseverity of the season and the want of Athenian co-operation. Such were\r\nthe chief enterprises and events of the third campaign, and Athens was\r\nstill powerful and unhumbled.\r\n\r\n(M506) The fourth year of the war was marked by a renewed invasion of\r\nAttica, without any other results than such as had happened before. But it\r\nwas a more serious calamity to the Athenians to learn that Mitylene and\r\nmost of Lesbos had revolted—one of the most powerful of the Athenian\r\nallies. Nothing was left to Athens but to subjugate the city. A large\r\nforce was sent for this purpose, but the inhabitants of Mitylene appealed\r\nto the Spartans for aid, and prepared for a vigorous resistance. But the\r\ntreasures of Athens were now nearly consumed, and the Athenians were\r\nobliged to resort to contributions to force the siege, which they did with\r\nvigor. The Lacedæmonians promised succor, and the Mitylenæans held out\r\ntill their provisions were exhausted, when they surrendered to the\r\nAthenians. The Lacedæmonians advanced to relieve their allies, but were\r\ntoo late. The Athenian admiral pursued them, and they returned to the\r\nPeloponnesus without having done any thing. Paches, the Athenian general,\r\nsent home one thousand Mitylenæan prisoners, while it was decreed to\r\nslaughter the whole remaining population—about six thousand—able to carry\r\narms, and makes slaves of the women and children. This severe measure was\r\nprompted by Cleon. But the Athenians repented, and a second decree of the\r\nassembly, through the influence of Diodotus, prevented the barbarous\r\nrevenge; but the Athenians put to death the prisoners which Paches had\r\nsent, razed the fortifications of Mitylene, took possession of all her\r\nships of war, and confiscated all the land of the island except that which\r\nbelonged to one town that had been faithful. So severe was ancient\r\nwarfare, even among the most civilized of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n(M507) The surrender of Platæa to the Lacedæmonians took place not long\r\nafter; but not until one-half of the garrison had sallied from the city,\r\nscaled the wall of circumvallation, and escaped safely to Athens. The\r\nPlatæans were sentenced to death by the Spartan judges, and barbarously\r\nslain. The captured women were sold as slaves, and the town and territory\r\nwere handed over to the Thebans.\r\n\r\n(M508) Scenes not less bloody took place in the western part of Greece, in\r\nthe island of Corcyra, before which a naval battle was fought between the\r\nLacedæmonians and the Athenians. The island had been governed by\r\noligarchies, under the protection of Sparta, but the retirement of the\r\nLacedæmonian fleet enabled the Athenian general to wreak his vengeance on\r\nthe party which had held supremacy, which was exterminated in the most\r\ncruel manner, which produced a profound sensation, and furnished\r\nThucydides a theme for the most profound reflections on the acerbity and\r\nferocity of the political parties, which, it seems, then divided Greece,\r\nand were among the exciting causes of the war itself—the struggle between\r\nthe advocates of democratic and aristocratic institutions.\r\n\r\n(M509) A new character now appears upon the stage at Athens—Nicias—one of\r\nthe ten generals who, in rank and wealth, was the equal of Pericles. He\r\nbelonged to the oligarchal party, and succeeded Cimon and Thucydides in\r\nthe control of it. But he was moderate in his conduct, and so won the\r\nesteem of his countrymen, that he retained power until his death, although\r\nopposed to the party which had the ascendency. He was incorruptible as to\r\npecuniary gains, and adopted the conservative views of Pericles, avoiding\r\nnew acquisitions at a distance, or creating new enemies. He surrounded\r\nhimself, not as Pericles did, with philosophers, but religions men,\r\navoided all scandals, and employed his large fortune in securing\r\npopularity. Pericles disdained to win the people by such means, cultivated\r\nart, and patronized the wits who surrounded Aspasia. Nicias was zealous in\r\nthe worship of the gods, was careful to make no enemies, and conciliated\r\nthe poor by presents. Yet he increased his private fortune, so far as he\r\ncould, by honorable means, and united thrift and sagacity with honesty and\r\npiety. He was not a man of commanding genius, but his character was above\r\nreproach, and was never assailed by the comic writers. He was the great\r\nopponent of Alcibiades, the oracle of the democracy—one of those memorable\r\ndemagogues who made use of the people to forward his ambitious projects.\r\nHe was also the opponent of Cleon, whose office it was to supervise\r\nofficial men for the public conduct—a man of great eloquence, but\r\nfault-finding and denunciatory.\r\n\r\n(M510) The fifth year of the war was not signalized by the usual invasion\r\nof Attica, which gave the Athenians leisure to send an expedition under\r\nNicias against the island of Melos, inhabited by ancient colonists from\r\nSparta. Demosthenes, another general, was sent around the Peloponnesus to\r\nattack Acarnania, and he ravaged the whole territory of Leueas. He also\r\nattacked Ætolia, but was completely beaten, and obliged to retire with\r\nloss; but this defeat was counterbalanced by a great victory, the next\r\nyear, over the enemy at Olpæ, when the Lacedæmonian general was slain. He\r\nreturned in triumph to Athens with considerable spoil. The attention of\r\nthe Athenians was now directed to Delos, the island sacred to Apollo, and\r\na complete purification of the island was made, and the old Delian\r\nfestivals renewed with peculiar splendor.\r\n\r\n(M511) The war had now lasted six years, without any grand or decisive\r\nresults on either side. The expeditions of both parties were of the nature\r\nof raids—destructive, cruel, irritating, but without bringing any grand\r\ntriumphs. Though the seventh year was marked by the usual enterprise on\r\nthe part of the Lacedæmonians—the invasion of Attica—Corcyra promised to\r\nbe the principal scene of military operations. Both an Athenian and\r\nSpartan fleet was sent thither. But an unforeseen incident gave a new\r\ncharacter to the war. In the course of the voyage to Corcyra, Demosthenes,\r\nthe Athenian general, stopped at Pylus, with the intention of erecting a\r\nfort on the uninhabited promontory, since it protected the spacious basin\r\nnow known as the bay of Navarino, and was itself easily defended.\r\nEurymedon, the admiral, insisted on going directly to Corcyra, but the\r\nfleet was driven by a storm into the very harbor which Demosthenes\r\nproposed to defend. The place was accordingly fortified by Demosthenes,\r\nwhere he himself remained with a garrison, while the fleet proceeded to\r\nCorcyra. Intelligence of this insult to Sparta—the attempt to plant a\r\nhostile fort on its territory—induced the Lacedæmonians to send their\r\nfleet to Pylus, instead of Corcyra. Forty-three triremes, under\r\nThrasymelidas, and a powerful land force, advanced to attack Demosthenes,\r\nintrenched with his small army on the rocky promontory. When the news of\r\nthis new diversion reached the Athenian fleet at Corcyra, it returned to\r\nPylus, to succor Demosthenes. Here a naval battle took place, in which the\r\nLacedæmonians were defeated. This defeat jeopardized the situation of the\r\nSpartan army which had occupied the island of Shacteria, cut off from\r\nsupplies from the main land, as well as the existence of the fleet. So\r\ngreat was this exigency, that the ephors came from Sparta to consult on\r\noperations. They took a desponding view, and sent a herald to the Athenian\r\ngenerals to propose an armistice, in order to allow time for envoys to go\r\nto Athens and treat for peace. But Athens demanded now her own terms,\r\nelated by the success. Cleon, the organ of the popular mind, excited and\r\nsanguine, gave utterance to the feelings of the people, and insisted on\r\nthe restoration of all the territory they had lost during the war. The\r\nLacedæmonian envoys, unable to resist a vehement speaker like Cleon, which\r\nrequired qualities they did not possess, and which could only be acquired\r\nfrom skill in managing popular assemblies, to which they were unused,\r\nreturned to Pylus. And it was the object of Cleon to prevent a hearing of\r\nthe envoys by a select committee (what they desired) for fear that Nicias\r\nand other conservative politicians would accede to their proposals. Thus\r\nthe best opportunity that could be presented for making an honorable peace\r\nand reuniting Greece was lost by the arts of a demagogue, who inflamed and\r\nshared the popular passions. Had Pericles been alive, the treaty would\r\nprobably have been made, but Nicias had not sufficient influence to secure\r\nit.\r\n\r\n(M512) War therefore recommenced, with fresh irritation. The Athenian\r\nfleet blockaded the island where the Spartan hoplites were posted, and\r\nfound in the attempt, which they thought so easy, unexpected obstacles.\r\nProvisions clandestinely continually reached the besieged. Week after week\r\npassed without the expected surrender. Demosthenes, baffled for want of\r\nprovisions and water for his own fleet, sent urgently to Athens for\r\nre-enforcements, which caused infinite mortification. The people now began\r\nto regret that they had listened to Cleon, and not to the voice of wisdom.\r\nCleon himself was sent with the re-enforcements demanded, against his\r\nwill, although he was not one of the ten generals. The island of\r\nSphacteria now contained the bravest of the Lacedæmonian troops—from the\r\nfirst families of Sparta—a prey which Cleon and Demosthenes were eager to\r\ngrasp. They attacked the island with a force double of that of the\r\ndefenders, altogether ten thousand men, eight hundred of whom were\r\nhoplites. The besieged could not resist this overwhelming force, and\r\nretreated to their last redoubt, but were surrounded and taken prisoners.\r\nThis surrender caused astonishment throughout Greece, since it was\r\nsupposed the Spartan hoplites would die, as they did at Thermopylæ, rather\r\nthan allow themselves to be taken alive, and this calamity diminished\r\ngreatly the lustre of the Spartan arms. A modern army, surrounded with an\r\noverwhelming force, against which all resistance was madness, would have\r\ndone the same as the Spartans. But it was a sad blow to them. Cleon,\r\nwithin twenty days of his departure, arrived at Athens with his three\r\nhundred Lacedæmonian prisoners, amid universal shouts of joy, for it was\r\nthe most triumphant success which the Athenians had yet obtained. The war\r\nwas prosecuted with renewed vigor, and the Lacedæmonians again made\r\nadvances for peace, but without effect. The flushed victors would hear of\r\nno terms but what were disgraceful to the Spartans. The chances were now\r\nmost favorable to Athens. Nicias invaded the Corinthian territory with\r\neighty triremes, two thousand hoplites, and two hundred horsemen, to say\r\nnothing of the large number which supported these, and committed the same\r\nravages that the Spartans and their allies had inflicted upon Attica.\r\n\r\nAmong other events, the Athenians this year captured the Persian\r\nambassador, Artaphernes, on his way to Sparta. He was brought to Athens,\r\nand his dispatches were translated and made public. He was sent back to\r\nEphesus, with Athenian envoys, to the great king, to counteract the\r\ninfluence of the Spartans, but Artaerxes had died when they reached Susa.\r\n\r\n(M513) The capture of Sphacteria, and the surrender of the whole\r\nLacedæmonian fleet, not only placed Athens, on the opening of the eighth\r\nyear of the war, in a situation more commanding than she had previously\r\nenjoyed, but stimulated her to renewed operations on a grander scale, not\r\nmerely against Sparta, but to recover the ascendency in Bœotia, which was\r\nheld before the thirty years’ truce. The Lacedæmonians, in concert with\r\nthe revolted Chalcidic allies of Athens in Thrace, and Perdiccas, king of\r\nMacedonia, also made great preparations for more decisive measures. The\r\nwar had dragged out seven years, and nothing was accomplished which\r\nseriously weakened either of the contending parties.\r\n\r\n(M514) The first movement was made by the Athenians on the Laconian coast.\r\nThe island of Cythera was captured by an expedition led by Nicias, of\r\nsixty triremes and two thousand hoplites, beside other forces, and the\r\ncoast was ravaged. Then Thyrea, an Æginetan settlement, between Laconia\r\nand Argolis, fell into the hands of the Athenians, and all the Æginetans\r\nwere either killed in the assault, or put to death as prisoners. These\r\nsuccessive disasters alarmed the Lacedæmonians, and they now began to fear\r\nrepeated assaults on their own territory, with a discontented population\r\nof Helots. This fear prompted an act of cruelty and treachery which had no\r\nparallel in the history of the war. Two thousand of the bravest Helots\r\nwere entrapped, as if especial honors were to be bestowed upon them, and\r\nbarbarously slain. None but the five ephors knew the bloody details. There\r\nwas even no public examination of this savage inhumanity, which shows that\r\nSparta was governed, as Venice was in the Middle Ages, by a small but\r\nexceedingly powerful oligarchy.\r\n\r\nAfter this cruelty was consummated, envoys came from Perdiccas and the\r\nChalcidians of Thrace, invoking aid against Athens. It was joyfully\r\ngranted, and Brasidas, at the request of Perdiccas and the Chalcidians,\r\nwas sent with a large force of Peloponnesian hoplites.\r\n\r\n(M515) Meanwhile the Athenians formed plans to attack Megara, whose\r\ninhabitants had stimulated the war, and had been the greatest sufferers by\r\nit. A force was sent under Hippocrates and Demosthenes to surprise the\r\nplace, and also Nisæa. The long walls of Megara, similar to those of\r\nAthens, were taken by surprise, and the Athenians found themselves at the\r\ngates of the city, which came near falling into their hands by treachery.\r\nBaffled for the moment, the Athenians attacked Clisæa, which lay behind\r\nit, and succeeded.\r\n\r\n(M516) But Brasidas, the Lacedæmonian general, learning that the long\r\nwalls had fallen into the hands of the Athenians, got together a large\r\nforce of six thousand hoplites and six hundred cavalry, and relieved\r\nMegara, and the Athenians were obliged to retire. Ultimately the Megarians\r\nregained possession of the long walls, and instituted an oligarchal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n(M517) The Athenians, disappointed in getting possession of Megara, which\r\nfailed by one of those accidents ever recurring in war, organized a large\r\nforce for the attack of Bœotia, on three sides, under Hippocrates and\r\nDemosthenes. The attack was first made at Siphae, by Demosthenes, on the\r\nCorinthian Gulf, but failed. In spite of this failure by sea, Hippocrates\r\nmarched with a land force to Delium, with seven thousand hoplites, and\r\ntwenty-five thousand other troops, and occupied the place, which was a\r\ntemple consecrated to Apollo, and strongly fortified it. When the work of\r\nfortification was completed, the army prepared to return to Athens.\r\n\r\n(M518) Forces from all parts of Bœotia rallied, and met the Athenians.\r\nAmong the forces of the Bœotians was the famous Theban band of three\r\nhundred select warriors, accustomed to fight in pairs, each man attached\r\nto his companion by peculiar ties of friendship. At Delium was fought the\r\ngreat battle of the war, in which the Athenians were routed, and the\r\ngeneral, Hippocrates, with a thousand hoplites, were slain. The victors\r\nrefused the Athenians the sacred right of burying their dead, unless they\r\nretired altogether from Delium—the post they had fortified on Bœotian\r\nterritory. To this the Athenians refused to submit, the consequence of\r\nwhich was the siege and capture of Delium.\r\n\r\nAmong the hoplites who fought in this unfortunate battle, which was a\r\ngreat discouragement to the Athenian cause, was the philosopher Socrates.\r\nThe famous Alcibiades also served in the cavalry, and helped to protect\r\nSocrates in his retreat, after having bravely fought.\r\n\r\n(M519) The disasters of the Athenians in Thrace were yet more\r\nconsiderable. Brasidas, with a large force, including seventeen hundred\r\nhoplites, rapidly marched through Thrace and Thessaly, and arrived in\r\nMacedonia safely, and attacked Acanthus, an ally of Athens. It fell into\r\nhis hands, as well as Stageirus, and he was thus enabled to lay plans for\r\nthe acquisition of Amphipolis, which was founded by Athenian colonists. He\r\nsoon became master of the surrounding territory. He then offered favorable\r\nterms of capitulation to the citizens of the town, which were accepted,\r\nand the city surrendered—the most important of all the foreign possessions\r\nof Athens. The bridge over the Strymon was also opened, by which all the\r\neastern allies of Athena were approachable by land. This great reverse\r\nsent dismay into the hearts of the Athenians, greater than had before been\r\nfelt. The bloody victory at Delium, and the conquests of Brasidas, more\r\nthan balanced the capture of Sphacteria. Sparta, under the victorious\r\nbanner of Brasidas, a general of great probity, good faith, and\r\nmoderation, now proclaimed herself liberator of Greece. Athens,\r\ndiscouraged and baffled, lost all the prestige she had gained.\r\n\r\n(M520) But Amphipolis was lost by the negligence of the Athenian\r\ncommanders. Encles and Thucydides, the historian, to whom the defense of\r\nthe place was intrusted, had means ample to prevent the capture had they\r\nemployed ordinary precaution. The Athenians, indignant, banished\r\nThucydides for twenty years, and probably Eucles also—a just sentence,\r\nsince they did not keep the bridge over the Strymon properly guarded, nor\r\nretained the Athenian squadron at Eion. The banishment of Thucydides gave\r\nhim leisure to write the history on which his great fame rests—the most\r\nable and philosophical of all the historical works of antiquity.\r\n\r\n(M521) Brasidas, after the fall of Amphipolis, extended his military\r\noperations with success. He took Torone, Lecythus, and other places, and\r\nthen went into winter quarters. The campaign had been disastrous to the\r\nAthenians, and a truce of one year was agreed upon by the belligerent\r\nparties—Athens of the one party, and Sparta, Corinth, Sicyon, Epidaurus,\r\nand Megara, of the other.\r\n\r\n(M522) The conditions of this truce stipulated that Delphi might be\r\nvisited by all Greeks, without distinction; that all violations of the\r\nproperty of the Delphian god should be promptly punished; that the\r\nAthenian garrisons at Pylus, Cythera, Nisæa, and Methana, should remain\r\nunmolested; that the Lacedæmonians should be free to use the sea for\r\ntrading purposes; and that neither side should receive deserters from the\r\nother—important to both parties, since Athens feared the revolt of subject\r\nallies, and Sparta the desertion of Helots.\r\n\r\nBut two days had elapsed after the treaty was made before Scione in Thrace\r\nrevolted to Brasidas—a great cause of exasperation to the Athenians,\r\nalthough the revolt took place before the treaty was known. Mendes, a\r\nneighboring town, also revolted. Brasidas sent the inhabitants a garrison\r\nto protect themselves, and departed with his forces for an expedition into\r\nthe interior of Macedonia, but was soon compelled to retreat before the\r\nIllyrians.\r\n\r\n(M523) An Athenian force, under Nicias and Nicostratus, however, proceeded\r\nto Thrace to recover the revolted cities. Everywhere else the truce was\r\nobserved. It was intended to give terms for more complete negotiations.\r\nThis was the policy of Nicias. But Cleon and his party, the democracy, was\r\nopposed to peace, and wished to prosecute the war vigorously in Thrace.\r\nBrasidas, on his part, was equally in favor of continued hostilities. And\r\nthis was the great question of the day in Greece.\r\n\r\n(M524) The war party triumphed, and Cleon, by no means an able general,\r\nwas sent with an expedition to recover Amphipolis, B.C. 422. He succeeded\r\nin taking Torone, but Amphipolis, built on a hill in the peninsula formed\r\nby the river Strymon, as it passes from the Strymonic Gulf to Lake\r\nKerkernilis, was a strongly fortified place in which Brasidas intrenched.\r\nHe was obliged to remain inactive at Eion, at the mouth of the river,\r\nthree miles distant from Amphipolis, which excited great discontent in his\r\narmy, but which was the wiser course, until his auxiliaries arrived. But\r\nthe murmur of the hoplites compelled him to some sort of action, and while\r\nhe was reconnoitering, he was attacked by Brasidas. Cleon was killed, and\r\nhis army totally defeated. Brasidas, the ablest general of the day,\r\nhowever, was also mortally wounded, and carried from the field. This\r\nunsuccessful battle compelled the Athenians to return home, deeply\r\ndisgusted with their generals. But they embarked in the enterprise\r\nreluctantly, and with no faith in their leader, and this was one cause of\r\ntheir defeat. The death of Brasidas, however, converted the defeat into a\r\nsubstantial victory, since there remained no Spartan with sufficient\r\nability to secure the confidence of the allies. Brasidas, when he died,\r\nwas the first man in Greece, and universally admired for his valor,\r\nintelligence, probity, and magnanimity.\r\n\r\n(M525) The battle of Amphipolis was decisive; it led to a peace between\r\nthe contending parties. It is called the peace of Nicias, made in March,\r\nB.C. 421. By the provisions of this treaty of peace, which was made for\r\nfifty years, Amphipolis was restored to the Athenians, all persons had\r\nfull liberty to visit the public temples of Greece, the Athenians restored\r\nthe captive Spartans, and the various towns taken during the war were\r\nrestored on both sides. This peace was concluded after a ten years’ war,\r\nwhen the resources of both parties were exhausted. It was a war of\r\nambition and jealousy, without sufficient reasons, and its consequences\r\nwere disastrous to the general welfare of Greece. In some respects it must\r\nbe considered, not merely as a war between Sparta and Athens to gain\r\nsupremacy, but a war between the partisans of aristocratic and democratic\r\ninstitutions throughout the various States.\r\n\r\n(M526) The peace made by Nicias between Athens and Sparta for fifty years\r\nwas not of long continuance. It was a truce rather than a treaty, since\r\nneither party was overthrown—but merely crippled—like Rome and Carthage\r\nafter the first Punic war. The same causes which provoked the contest\r\nstill remained—an unextinguishable jealousy between States nearly equal in\r\npower, and the desire of ascendency at any cost. But we do not perceive in\r\neither party that persistent and self-sacrificing spirit which marked the\r\nRomans in their conquest of Italy. The Romans abandoned every thing which\r\ninterfered with their aggressive policy: the Grecian States were diverted\r\nfrom political aggrandizement by other objects of pursuit—pleasure, art,\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\n(M527) There was needed only a commanding demagogue, popular, brilliant,\r\nand unprincipled, to embroil Greece once more in war, and such a man was\r\nAlcibiades, who appeared upon the stage at the death of Cleon. And\r\nhostilities were easily kindled, since the allies on both sides were\r\naverse to the treaty which had been made, and the conditions of the peace\r\nwere not fulfilled. Athens returned the captive Spartans she had held\r\nsince the battle of Sphacteria, but Amphipolis was not restored, from the\r\ncontinued enmity of the Thracian cities. Both parties were full of\r\nintrigues, and new combinations were constantly being formed. Argos became\r\nthe centre of a new Peloponnesian alliance. A change of ephors at Sparta\r\nfavored hostile measures, and an alliance was made between the Bœotians\r\nand Lacedæmonians. The Athenians, on their side, captured Scione, and put\r\nto death the prisoners.\r\n\r\n(M528) It was in this unsettled state of things, when all the late\r\ncontending States were insincere and vacillating, that Alcibiades stood\r\nforth as a party leader. He was thirty-one years of age, belonged to an\r\nancient and powerful family, possessed vast wealth, had great personal\r\nbeauty and attractive manners, but above all, was unboundedly ambitious,\r\nand grossly immoral—the most insolent, unprincipled, licentious, and\r\nselfish man that had thus far scandalized and adorned Athenian society.\r\nThe only redeeming feature in his character was his friendship for\r\nSocrates, who, it seems, fascinated him by his talk, and sought to improve\r\nhis morals. He had those brilliant qualities, and luxurious habits, and\r\nostentatious prodigality, which so often dazzle superficial people,\r\nespecially young men of fashion and wealth, but more even than they, the\r\nidolatrous rabble. So great was his popularity and social prestige, that\r\nno injured person ever dared to bring him to trial, and he even rescued\r\nhis own wife from the hands of the law when she sought to procure a\r\ndivorce—a proof that even in democratic Athens all bowed down to the\r\ninsolence of wealth and high social position.\r\n\r\n(M529) Alcibiades, though luxurious and profligate, saw that a severe\r\nintellectual training was necessary to him if he would take rank as a\r\npolitician, for a politician who can not make a speech stands a poor\r\nchance of popular favor. So he sought the instructions of Socrates,\r\nProdicus, Protagoras, and others—not for love of learning, but as means of\r\nsuccess, although it may be supposed that the intellectual excitement,\r\nwhich the discourse, cross-examination, and ironical sallies of Socrates\r\nproduced, was not without its force on so bright a mind.\r\n\r\n(M530) Alcibiades commenced his public life with a sullied reputation, and\r\nwith numerous enemies created by his unbearable insolence, but with a\r\nflexibility of character which enabled him to adapt himself to whatever\r\nhabits circumstances required. He inspired no confidence, and his\r\nextravagant mode of life was sure to end in ruin, unless he reimbursed\r\nhimself out of the public funds; and yet he fascinated the people who\r\nmistrusted and hated him. The great comic poet, Aristophanes, said of him\r\nto the Athenians: “You ought not to keep a lion’s whelp in your city at\r\nall, but if you choose to keep him, you must submit to his behavior.”\r\n\r\n(M531) Alcibiades, in commencing his political life, departed from his\r\nfamily traditions; for he was a relative of Pericles, and became a\r\npartisan of the oligarchal party. But he soon changed his polities, on\r\nreceiving a repulse from the Spartans, who despised him, and he became a\r\nviolent democrat. His first memorable effort was to bring Argos, then in\r\nleague with Sparta, into alliance with Athens, in which he was successful.\r\nHe then cheated the Lacedæmonian envoys who were sent to protest against\r\nthe alliance and make other terms, and put them in a false position, and\r\nmade them appear deceitful, and thus arrayed against them the wrath of the\r\nAthenians. As Alcibiades had prevailed upon these envoys, by false\r\npromises and advice, to act a part different from what they were sent to\r\nperform, Nicias was sent to Sparta to clear up embarrassments, but failed\r\nin his object, upon which Athens concluded an alliance with Argos, Elis,\r\nand Mantinea, which only tended to complicate existing difficulties.\r\n\r\n(M532) Shortly after this alliance was concluded, the Olympic games were\r\ncelebrated with unusual interest, from which the Athenians had been\r\nexcluded during the war. Here Alcibiades appeared with seven chariots,\r\neach with four horses, when the richest Greeks had hitherto possessed but\r\none, and gained two prizes. He celebrated his success by a magnificent\r\nbanquet more stately and expensive than those given by kings. But while\r\nthe Athenians thus appeared at the ninetieth Olympiad, the Lacedæmonians\r\nwere excluded by the Eleians, who controlled the festival, from an alleged\r\nviolation of the Olympic truce, but really from the intrigues of\r\nAlcibiades.\r\n\r\n(M533) The subsequent attack of Argos and Athens on Epidaurus proved that\r\nthe peace between Athens and Sparta existed only in name. It was\r\ndistinctly violated by the attack of Argos by the Lacedæmonians, Bœotians,\r\nand Corinthians, and the battle of Mantinea opened again the war. This was\r\ndecided in favor of the Lacedæmonians, with a great loss to the Athenians\r\nand their allies, including both their generals, Laches and Nicostratus.\r\n\r\n(M534) The moral effect of the battle of Mantinea, B.C. 418, was\r\noverwhelming throughout Greece, and re-established the military prestige\r\nof Sparta. It was lost by the withdrawal of three thousand Eleians before\r\nthe battle, illustrating the remark of Pericles that numerous and equal\r\nallies could never be kept in harmonious co-operation. One effect of the\r\nbattle was a renewed alliance between Sparta and Argos, and the\r\nre-establishment of an oligarchal government in the latter city. Mantinea\r\nsubmitted to Sparta, and the Achaian towns were obliged to submit to a\r\nremodeling of their political institutions, according to the views of\r\nSparta. The people of Argos, however, took the first occasion which was\r\npresented for regaining their power, assisted by an Athenian force under\r\nAlcibiades, and Argos once again became an ally of Athens.\r\n\r\n(M535) The next important operation of the war was the siege and conquest\r\nof Melos, a Dorian island, by the Athenians, B.C. 416. The inhabitants\r\nwere killed, and the women and children were sold as slaves, and an\r\nAthenian colony was settled on the island. But this massacre, exceeding\r\neven the customary cruelty of war in those times, raised a general\r\nindignation among the allies of Sparta.\r\n\r\n(M536) But an expedition of far greater importance was now undertaken by\r\nthe Athenians—the most gigantic effort which they ever made, but which\r\nterminated disastrously, and led to the ruin and subjugation of their\r\nproud and warlike city, as a political power. This was the invasion of\r\nSicily and siege of Syracuse.\r\n\r\nBefore we present this unfortunate expedition, some brief notice is\r\nnecessary of the Grecian colonies in Sicily.\r\n\r\n(M537) In the eighth century before Christ Sicily was inhabited by two\r\ndistinct races of barbarians—the Sikels and Sikans—besides Phœnician\r\ncolonies, for purposes of trade. The Sikans were an Iberian tribe, and\r\nwere immigrants of an earlier date than the Sikels, by whom they were\r\ninvaded. The earliest Grecian colony was (B.C. 735) at Naxos, on the\r\neastern coast of the island, between the Straits of Messina and Mount\r\nÆtna, founded by Theocles, a Chalcidian mariner, who was cast by storms\r\nupon the coast, and built a fort on a hill called Taurus, to defend\r\nhimself against the Sikels, who were in possession of the larger half of\r\nthe island. Other colonists followed, chiefly from the Peloponnesus. In\r\nthe year following that Naxos was founded, a body of settlers from Corinth\r\nlanded on the islet Ortygia, expelled the Sikel inhabitants, and laid the\r\nfoundation of Syracuse. Successive settlements were made forty-five years\r\nafter at Gela, in the southwestern part of the island. Other settlements\r\ncontinued to be made, not only from Greece, but from the colonies\r\nthemselves; so that the old inhabitants were gradually Hellenized and\r\nmerged with Greek colonists, while the Greeks, in their turn, adopted many\r\nof the habits and customs of the Sikels and Sikans. The various races\r\nlived on terms of amity, for the native population was not numerous enough\r\nto become formidable to the Grecian colonists.\r\n\r\n(M538) Five hundred years before Christ the most powerful Grecian cities\r\nin Sicily were Agrigentum and Gela, on the south side of the island. The\r\nformer, within a few years of its foundation, B.C. 570, fell under the\r\ndominion of one of its rich citizens, Phalasaris, who proved a cruel\r\ndespot, but after a reign of sixteen years he was killed in an\r\ninsurrection, and an oligarchal government was established, such as then\r\nexisted in most of the Grecian cities. Syracuse was governed in this way\r\nby the descendants of the original settlers. Gela was, on the other hand,\r\nruled by a despot called Gelo, the most powerful man on the island. He got\r\npossession of Syracuse, B.C. 485, and transferred the seat of his power to\r\nthis city, by bringing thither the leading people and making slaves of the\r\nrest. Under Gelo Syracuse became the first city on the island, to which\r\nother towns were tributary. When the Greeks confederated against Xerxes,\r\nthey sent to solicit his aid as the imperial leader of Sicily, and he\r\ncould command, according to Herodotus, twenty thousand hoplites, two\r\nhundred triremes, two thousand cavalry, two thousand archers, and two\r\nthousand light-armed horse. So great was then the power of this despot,\r\nwho now sought to expel the Carthaginians and unite all the Hellenic\r\ncolonies in Sicily under his sway. But the aid was not given, probably on\r\naccount of a Carthaginian invasion simultaneous with the expedition of the\r\nPersian king. The Carthaginians, according to the historian, arrived at\r\nPanormus B.C. 480, with a fleet of three thousand ships and a land force\r\nof three hundred thousand men, besides chariots and horses, under\r\nHamilcar—a mercenary army, composed of various African nations. Gelo\r\nmarched against him with fifty thousand foot and five thousand horse, and\r\ngained a complete victory, so that one hundred and fifty thousand, on the\r\nside of the Carthaginians, were slain, together with their general. The\r\nnumber of the combatants is doubtless exaggerated, but we may believe that\r\nthe force was very great. Gelo was now supreme in Sicily, and the victory\r\nof Himera, which he had gained, enabled him to distribute a large body of\r\nprisoners, as slaves, in all the Grecian colonies. It appears that he was\r\nmuch respected, but he died shortly after his victory, leaving an infant\r\nson to the guardianship of two of his brothers, Polyzelus and Hiero, who\r\nbecame the supreme governors of the island. A victory gained by Hiero over\r\nthe tyrant of Agrigentum gave him the same supremacy which Gelo had\r\nenjoyed. On his death, B.C. 467, the succession was disputed between his\r\nbrother, Thrasybulus, and his nephew, the son of Gelo; but Thrasybulus\r\ncontrived to make away with his nephew, and reigned alone, cruelly and\r\ndespotically, until a revolution took place, which resulted in his\r\nexpulsion and the fall of the Gelonian dynasty. Popular governments were\r\nnow established in all the Sicilian cities, but these were distracted by\r\ndisputes and confusions. Syracuse became isolated from the other cities,\r\nand a government whose powers were limited by the city. The expulsion of\r\nthe Gelonian dynasty left the Grecian cities to reorganize free and\r\nconstitutional governments; but Syracuse maintained a proud pre-eminence,\r\nand her power was increased from time to time by conquests in the interior\r\nover the old population. Agrigentum was next in power, and scarcely\r\ninferior in wealth. The temple of Zeus, in this city, was one of the most\r\nmagnificent in the world. The population was large, and many were the rich\r\nmen who kept chariots and competed at the Olympic games. In these Sicilian\r\ncities the intellectual improvement kept pace with the material, and the\r\nlittle town of Elea supported the two greatest speculative philosophers of\r\nGreece—Parmenides and Zeno. Empedocles, of Agrigentum, was scarcely less\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\n(M539) Such was the state of the Sicilian cities on the outbreak of the\r\nPeloponnesian war. Being generally of Dorian origin, they sympathized with\r\nSparta, and great expectations were formed by the Lacedæmonians of\r\nassistance from their Sicilian allies. The cities of Sicily could not\r\nbehold the contest between Athens and Sparta without being drawn into the\r\nquarrel, and the result was that the Dorian cities made war on the Ionian\r\ncities, which, of course, sympathized with Athens. As these cities were\r\nweaker than the Dorian, they solicited aid from Athens, and an expedition\r\nwas sent to Sicily under Laches, B.C. 426. Another one, under Polydorus,\r\nfollowed, but without decisive results. The next year still another and\r\nlarger expedition, under Eurymedon and Sophocles, arrived in Sicily, while\r\nAthens was jubilant by the possession of the Spartan prisoners, and the\r\npossession of Pylus and Cythera. The Sicilian cities now fearing that\r\ntheir domestic strife would endanger their independence and make them\r\nsubject to Athens, the most ambitious and powerful State in Greece, made a\r\ncommon league with each other. Eurymedon acceded to the peace and returned\r\nto Athens, much to the displeasure of the war party, which embraced most\r\nof the people, and he and his colleague were banished.\r\n\r\n(M540) But wars between the Sicilian cities again led to the intervention\r\nof Athens. Egesta especially sent envoys for help in her struggle against\r\nSelinus, which was assisted by Syracuse. Alcibiades warmly seconded these\r\nenvoys, and inflamed the people with his ambitious projects. He, more than\r\nany other man, was the cause of the great Sicilian expedition which proved\r\nthe ruin of his country. He was opposed by Nicias, who foretold all the\r\nmiserable consequences of so distant an expedition, when so little could\r\nbe gained and so much would be jeopardized, and when, on the first\r\nreverse, the enemies of Athens would rally against her. He particularly\r\ncautioned his countrymen not only against the expedition, but against\r\nintrusting the command of it to an unprincipled and selfish man who\r\nsquandered his own patrimony in chariot races and other extravagances, and\r\nwould be wasteful of the public property—a man without the experience\r\nwhich became a leader in so great an enterprise. Alcibiades, in reply,\r\njustified his extravagance at the Olympic games, where he contested with\r\nseven chariots, as a means to impress Sparta with the wealth and power of\r\nAthens, after a ten years’ war. He inflamed the ambition of the assembly,\r\nheld out specious hopes of a glorious conquest which would add to Athenian\r\npower, and make her not merely pre-eminent, but dominant in Greece. The\r\nassembly, eager for war and glory, sided with the youthful and magnificent\r\ndemagogue, and disregarded the counsels of the old patriot, whose wisdom\r\nand experience were second to none in the city.\r\n\r\n(M541) Consequently the expedition was fitted out for the attack of\r\nSyracuse—the largest and most powerful which Athens ever sent against an\r\nenemy; for all classes, maddened by military glory, or tempted by love of\r\ngain, eagerly embarked in the enterprise. Nicias, finding he could not\r\nprevent the expedition, demanded more than he thought the people would be\r\nwilling to grant. He proposed a gigantic force. But in proposing this\r\nforce, he hoped he might thus discourage the Athenians altogether by the\r\nvery greatness of the armament which he deemed necessary. But so popular\r\nwas the enterprise, that the large force he suggested was voted.\r\nAlcibiades had flattered the people that their city was mistress of the\r\nsea, and entitled to dominion over all the islands, and could easily\r\nprevail over any naval enemy.\r\n\r\n(M542) Three years had now elapsed since the peace of Nicias, and Athens\r\nhad ample means. The treasury was full, and triremes had accumulated in\r\nthe harbor. The confidence of the Athenians was as unbounded as was that\r\nof Xerxes when he crossed the Hellespont, and hence there had been great\r\nzeal and forwardness in preparation.\r\n\r\n(M543) When the expedition was at last ready, an event occurred which\r\nfilled the city with gloom and anxious forebodings. The half statues of\r\nthe god Hermes were distributed in great numbers in Athens in the most\r\nconspicuous situations, beside the doors of private houses and temples,\r\nand in the agora, so that the people were accustomed to regard the god as\r\ndomiciled among them for their protection. In one night, at the end of\r\nMay, B.C. 415, these statues were nearly all mutilated. The heads, necks,\r\nand busts were all destroyed, leaving the lower part of them—mere\r\nquadrangular pillars, without arms, or legs, or body—alone standing. The\r\nsacrilege sent universal dismay into the city, and was regarded as a most\r\ndepressing omen, and was done, doubtless, with a view of ruining\r\nAlcibiades and frustrating the expedition. But all efforts were vain to\r\ndiscover the guilty parties.\r\n\r\n(M544) And this was not the only means adopted to break down the power of\r\na man whom the more discerning perceived was the evil genius of Athens.\r\nAlcibiades was publicly accused of having profaned and divulged the\r\nEleusinian mysteries. The charge was denied by Alcibiades, who demanded an\r\nimmediate trial. It was eluded by his enemies, who preferred to have the\r\ncharge hanging over his head, in case of the failure of the enterprise\r\nwhich he had projected.\r\n\r\n(M545) So the fleet sailed from Piræus amid mingled sentiments of anxiety\r\nand popular enthusiasm. It consisted of one hundred triremes, with a large\r\nbody of hoplites. It made straight for Corcyra, where the contingents of\r\nthe allies were assembled, which nearly doubled its force. The Syracusans\r\nwere well informed as to its destination, and made great exertions to meet\r\nthis great armament, under Nicias, Alcibiades, and Lamachus. The latter\r\ncommander recommended an immediate attack of Syracuse, as unprepared and\r\ndismayed.\r\n\r\n(M546) Alcibiades wished first to open negotiations with the Sikels, of\r\nthe interior, to detach them from the aid of Syracuse. His plan was\r\nfollowed, but before he could carry it into operation he was summoned home\r\nto take his trial. Fearing the result of the accusations against him, for,\r\nin his absence, the popular feeling had changed respecting him—fear and\r\nreason had triumphed over the power of his personal fascination—Alcibiades\r\nmade his escape to the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\n(M547) The master spirit of the expedition was now removed, and its\r\noperations were languid and undecided, for Nicias had no heart in it. The\r\ndelays which occurred gave the Syracusans time to prepare, and more\r\nconfidence in their means of defense. So that when the forces of the\r\nAthenians were landed in the great harbor, they found a powerful army\r\nready to resist them. In spite of a victory which Nicias gained near\r\nOlympeion, the Syracusans were not dejected, and the Athenian fleet was\r\nobliged to seek winter quarters at Catana, and also send for additional\r\nre-enforcements. Nicias unwisely delayed, but his inexcusable apathy\r\nafforded the enemy leisure to enlarge their fortifications. The Syracusans\r\nconstructed an entirely new wall around the inner and outer city, and\r\nwhich also extended across the whole space from the outer sea to the great\r\nharbor, so that it would be difficult for the Athenians, in the coming\r\nsiege, to draw lines of circumvallation around the city. Syracuse also\r\nsent envoys to Corinth and Sparta for aid, while Alcibiades, filled now\r\nwith intense hatred of Athens, encouraged the Lacedæmonians to send a\r\nforce to the Sicilian capital. He admitted that it was the design of\r\nAthens first to conquer the Sicilian Greeks, and then the Italian Greeks;\r\nthen to make an attempt on Carthage, and then, if that was successful, to\r\nbring together all the forces of the subjected States and attack the\r\nPeloponnesus itself, and create a great empire, of which Athens was to be\r\nthe capital. Such an avowal was doubtless the aim of the ambitious\r\nAlcibiades when he first stimulated the enterprise, which, if successful,\r\nwould have made him the most powerful man in Greece; but he was thwarted\r\nby his enemies at home, and so he turned all his energies against his\r\nnative State. His address made a powerful effect on the Lacedæmonians,\r\nwho, impelled by hatred and jealousy, now resolved to make use of the\r\nservices of the traitor, and send an auxiliary force to Syracuse.\r\n\r\n(M548) That city then consisted of two parts—an inner and an outer city.\r\nThe outer city was defended on two sides by the sea, and a sea wall. On\r\nthe land side a long wall extended from the sea to the fortified high land\r\nof Achradina, so that the city could only be taken by a wall of\r\ncircumvallation, so as to cut off supplies by land; at the same time it\r\nwas blockaded by sea. But the delay of Nicias had enabled the Syracusans\r\nto construct a new wall, covering both the outer and inner city, and\r\nextending from the great port to the high land near the bay of Magnesi, so\r\nthat any attack, except from a single point, was difficult, unless the\r\nwall of circumvallation was made much larger than was originally intended.\r\nAmid incredible difficulties the Athenians constructed their works, and in\r\nan assault from the cliff of Epipolæ, where they were intrenched, their\r\ngeneral, Lamachus, was slain. But the Athenians had gained an advantage,\r\nand the siege was being successfully prosecuted. It was then that the\r\nLacedæmonians arrived under Gylippus, who was unable to render succor. But\r\nNicias, despising him, allowed him to land at Himera, from whence he\r\nmarched across Sicily to Syracuse. A Corinthian fleet, under Gorgylus,\r\narrived only just in time to prevent the city from capitulating, and\r\nGylippus entered Syracuse unopposed. The inaction of Nicias, who could\r\nhave prevented this, is unaccountable. But the arrival of Gylippus turned\r\nthe scale, and he immediately prosecuted vigorous and aggressive measures.\r\nHe surprised an Athenian fort, and began to construct a third counter-wall\r\non the north side of the Athenian circle. The Athenians, now shut up\r\nwithin their lines, were obliged to accept battle, and were defeated, and\r\neven forced to seek shelter within their fortified lines. Under this\r\ndiscouragement, Nicias sent to Athens for another armament, and the\r\nAthenians responded to his call. But Sparta also resolved to send\r\nre-enforcements, and invade Attica besides. Sicilian forces also marched\r\nin aid of Syracuse. The result of all these gathering forces, in which the\r\nwhole strength of Greece was employed, was the total defeat of the\r\nAthenian fleet in the Great Harbor, in spite of the powerful fleet which\r\nhad sailed from Athens under Demosthenes. The Syracusans pursued their\r\nadvantage by blocking up the harbor, and inclosing the whole Athenian\r\nfleet. The Athenians resolved then to force their way out, which led to\r\nanother general engagement, in which the Athenians were totally defeated.\r\nNicias once again attempted to force his way out, with the remainder of\r\nhis defeated fleet, but the armament was too much discouraged to obey, and\r\nthe Athenians sought to retreat by land. But all the roads were blockaded.\r\nThe miserable army, nevertheless, began its hopeless march completely\r\ndemoralized, and compelled to abandon the sick and wounded. The retreating\r\narmy was harassed on every side, no progress could be made, and the\r\ndiscouraged army sought in the night to retreat by a different route. The\r\nrear division, under Demosthenes, was overtaken and forced to surrender,\r\nand were carried captives to Syracuse—some six thousand in number. The\r\nnext day, the first division, under Nicias, also was overtaken and made\r\nprisoners. No less than forty thousand who had started from the Athenian\r\ncamp, six days before, were either killed or made prisoners, with the two\r\ngenerals who commanded them. The prisoners at first were subjected to the\r\nmost cruel and inhuman treatment, and then sold as slaves. Both Nicias and\r\nDemosthenes were put to death, B.C. 413.\r\n\r\n(M549) Such was the disastrous close of the Sicilian expedition. Our\r\nlimits prevent an extended notice. We can only give the barren outline.\r\nBut never in Grecian history had so large a force been arrayed against a\r\nforeign power, and never was ruin more complete. The enterprise was\r\nstarted at the instance of Alcibiades. It was he who brought this disaster\r\non his country. But it would have been better to have left the expedition\r\nto his management. Nicias was a lofty and religious man, but was no\r\ngeneral. He grossly mismanaged from first to last. The confidence of the\r\nAthenians was misplaced; and he, after having spent his life in\r\ninculcating a conservative policy, which was the wiser, yet became the\r\nunwilling instrument of untold and unparalleled calamities. His fault was\r\nover-confidence. He was personally brave, religious, incorruptible,\r\nmunificent, affable—in all respects honorable and respectable, but he had\r\nno military genius.\r\n\r\n(M550) The Lacedæmonians, at the suggestion of Alcibiades, had permanently\r\noccupied Decelea—a fortified post within fifteen miles of Athens, and\r\ninstead of spending a few weeks in ravaging Attica, now intrenched\r\nthemselves, and issued out in excursions until they had destroyed all that\r\nwas valuable in the neighborhood of Athens. The great calamities which the\r\nAthenians had suffered prevented them from expelling the invaders, and the\r\ncity itself was now in the condition of a post besieged. All the\r\naccumulations in her treasury were exhausted, and she was compelled to\r\ndismiss even her Thracian mercenaries. They were sent back to their own\r\ncountry under Dotrephes; but after inflicting great atrocities in Bœotia,\r\nwere driven back by the Thebans.\r\n\r\n(M551) The Athenian navy was now so crippled that it could no longer\r\nmaintain the supremacy of the sea. The Corinthians were formidable rivals\r\nand enemies. A naval battle at Naupactus, at the mouth of the Corinthian\r\nGulf, between the Athenians and Corinthians, though indecisive, yet really\r\nwas to the advantage of the latter.\r\n\r\n(M552) The full effects of the terrible catastrophe at Syracuse were not\r\nat first made known to the Athenians, but gradually a settled despair\r\noverspread the public mind. The supremacy of Athens in Greece was at an\r\nend, and the city itself was endangered. The inhabitants now put forth all\r\nthe energies that a forlorn hope allowed. The distant garrisons were\r\nrecalled; all expenses were curtailed; timber was collected for new ships,\r\nand Capo Sunium was fortified. But the enemies of Athens were also\r\nstimulated to renewed exertions, and subject-allies were induced to\r\nrevolt. Persia sent envoys to Sparta. The Eubœans and Chians applied to\r\nthe same power for aid in shaking off the yoke of Athens now broken and\r\ndefenseless. Although a Peloponnesian fleet was defeated by the Athenians\r\non its way to assist Chios in revolt, yet new dangers multiplied. The\r\ninfamous Alcibiades crossed with a squadron to Chios, and the Athenians\r\nwere obliged to make use of their reserved fund of one thousand talents,\r\nwhich Pericles had set aside for the last extremity, in order to equip a\r\nfleet, under the command of Strombichides. Alcibiades passed over to\r\nMiletus, and induced this city also to revolt. A shameful treaty was made\r\nbetween Sparta and Persia to carry on war against Athens; and the first\r\nstep in the execution of the treaty was to hand Miletus over to a Persian\r\ngeneral. Ionia now became the seat of war, and a victory was gained near\r\nMiletus by the Athenians, but this was balanced by the capture of Iasus by\r\nthe Lacedæmonians. The Athenians rallied at Samos, which remained\r\nfaithful, and still controlled one hundred and twenty-eight triremes at\r\nthis island. Alternate successes and defeats happened to the contending\r\nparties, with no decided result.\r\n\r\n(M553) The want of success on the coast of Asia led the Lacedæmonians to\r\nsuspect Alcibiades of treachery. Moreover, his intrigue with the wife of\r\nAgis made the king of Sparta his relentless enemy. Agis accordingly\r\nprocured a decision of the ephors to send out instructions for his death.\r\nHe was warned in time, and made his escape to the satrap Tissaphernes, who\r\ncommanded the forces of Persia. He persuaded the Persian not to give a\r\ndecisive superiority to either of the contending parties, who followed his\r\nadvice, and kept the Peloponnesian fleet inactive, and bribed the Spartan\r\ngeneral. Having now gratified his revenge against Athens and lost the\r\nsupport of Sparta, Alcibiades now looked to his native country as the best\r\nfield for his unprincipled ambition. “He opened negotiations with the\r\nAthenian commanders at Samos, and offered the alliance of Persia as the\r\nprice of his restoration, but proposed as a further condition the\r\noverthrow of the democratic government at Athens.”\r\n\r\n(M554) Then followed the political revolution which Alcibiades had\r\nplanned, in conjunction with oligarchal conspirators. The rally of the\r\ncity, threatened with complete ruin, had been energetic and astonishing,\r\nand she was now, a year after the disaster at Syracuse, able to carry on a\r\npurely defensive system, though with crippled resources. But for this\r\nrevolution Athens might have secured her independence.\r\n\r\n(M555) The proposal of Alcibiades to change the constitution was listened\r\nto by the rich men, on whom the chief burden of the war had fallen. With\r\nthe treasures of Persia to help them, they hoped to carry on the war\r\nagainst Sparta without cost to themselves. It was hence resolved at Samos,\r\namong the Athenians congregated there, to send a deputation to Athens,\r\nunder Pisander, to carry out their designs. But they had no other security\r\nthan the word of Alcibiades, that restless and unpatriotic schemer, that\r\nthey would secure the assistance of Persia. And it is astonishing that\r\nsuch a man—so faithless—could be believed.\r\n\r\n(M556) One of the generals of the fleet at Samos, Phrynichus, strongly\r\nopposed this movement, and gave good reasons; but the tide of opinion\r\namong the oligarchal conspirators ran so violently against him, that\r\nPisander was at once dispatched to Athens. He laid before the public\r\nassembly the terms which Alcibiades proposed. The people, eager at any\r\ncost to gain the Persian king as an ally, in their extremity listened to\r\nthe proposal, though unwilling, and voted to relinquish their political\r\npower. Pisander made them believe it was a choice between utter ruin and\r\nthe relinquishment of political privileges, since the Lacedæmonians had an\r\noverwhelming force against them. It was while Chios seemed likely to be\r\nrecovered by the Athenians, and while the Peloponnesian fleet was\r\nparalyzed at Rhodes by Persian intrigues, that Pisander returned to Ionia\r\nto open negotiations with Alcibiades and Tissaphernes. But Alcibiades had\r\npromised too much, the satrap having no idea of lending aid to Athens, and\r\nyet he extricated himself by such exaggerated demands, which he knew the\r\nAthenians would never concede to Persia, that negotiations were broken\r\noff, and a reconciliation was made between Persia and Sparta. The\r\noligarchal conspirators had, however, gone so far that a retreat was\r\nimpossible. The democracy of Athens was now subverted. Instead of the\r\nSenate of Five Hundred and the assembled people, an oligarchy of Four\r\nHundred sat in the Senate house, and all except five thousand were\r\ndisfranchised—and these were not convened. The oligarchy was in full power\r\nwhen Pisander returned to Athens. All democratic magistrates had been\r\nremoved, and no civil functionaries were paid. The Four Hundred had\r\ncomplete control. Thus perished, through the intrigues of Alcibiades, the\r\ndemocracy of Athens. He had organized the unfortunate expedition to\r\nSicily; he had served the bitterest enemies of his country; and now, he\r\nhad succeeded in overturning the constitution which had lasted one hundred\r\nyears, during which Athens had won all her glories. Why should the\r\nAthenians receive back to their confidence so bad a man? But whom God\r\nwishes to destroy, he first makes mad, and Alcibiades, it would seem, was\r\nthe instrument by which Athens was humiliated and ruined as a political\r\npower. The revolution was effected in an hour of despair, and by delusive\r\npromises. The character and conduct of the insidious and unscrupulous\r\nintriguer were forgotten in his promises. The Athenians were simply\r\ncheated.\r\n\r\n(M557) The Four Hundred, installed in power, solemnized their installation\r\nby prayer and sacrifice, put to death some political enemies, imprisoned\r\nand banished others, and ruled with great rigor and strictness. They then\r\nsought to make peace with Sparta, which was declined. The army at Samos\r\nheard of these changes with exceeding wrath, especially the cruelties\r\nwhich were inflicted on all citizens who spoke against the new tyranny. A\r\ndemocratic demonstration took place at Samos, by which the Samians and the\r\narmy were united in the strongest ties, for the Samians had successfully\r\nresisted a like revolution on their island. The army at Samos refused to\r\nobey any orders from the oligarchy, and constituted a democracy by\r\nthemselves. Yet the man who had been instrumental in creating this\r\noligarchy, with characteristic versatility and impudence, joined the\r\ndemocracy at Samos. He came to Samos by invitation of the armament, and\r\npledged himself to secure Persian aid, and he was believed and again\r\ntrusted. He then launched into a new career, and professed to take up\r\nagain the interests of the democracy at Athens. The envoys of the Four\r\nHundred which were sent to Samos were indignantly sent back, and the\r\ngeneral indignation against the oligarchy was intensified. Envoys from\r\nArgos also appeared at Samos, offering aid to the Athenian democracy.\r\nThere was now a strong and organized resistance to the Four Hundred, and\r\ntheir own divisions placed them further in a precarious situation.\r\nTheramenes demanded that the Five Thousand, which body had been thus far\r\nnominal, should be made a reality. The Four Hundred again solicited aid\r\nfrom Sparta, and constructed a fort for the admission of a Spartan\r\ngarrison, while a Lacedæmonian fleet hovered near the Piræus.\r\n\r\n(M558) The long-suppressed energies of the people at length burst forth. A\r\nbody of soldiers seized the fortress the oligarchy were constructing for a\r\nSpartan garrison, and demolished it. The Four Hundred made important\r\nconcessions, and agreed to renew the public assembly. While these events\r\noccurred a naval battle took place near Eretria between the Lacedæmonians\r\nand the Athenians, in which the latter were defeated. The victory, if they\r\nhad pushed their success, would have completed the ruin of Athens, since\r\nher home fleet was destroyed, and that at Samos was detained by\r\nAlcibiades. When it was seen the hostile fleet did not enter the harbor,\r\nthe Athenians recovered their dismay and prosecuted their domestic\r\nrevolution by deposing the Four Hundred and placing the whole government\r\nin the hands of the Five Thousand, and this body was soon enlarged to that\r\nof universal citizenship. The old constitution was restored, except that\r\npart of it which allowed pay to the judges. Most of the oligarchal leaders\r\nfled, and a few of them were tried and executed—those who had sought\r\nSpartan aid. Thus this selfish movement terminated, after the oligarchy\r\nhad enjoyed a brief reign of only a few months.\r\n\r\n(M559) While Athens was distracted by changes of government, the war was\r\nconducted on the coasts of Asia between the belligerents with alternate\r\nsuccess and defeat. Abydos, connected with Miletus by colonial ties,\r\nrevolted from Athens, and Lampsacus, a neighboring town, followed its\r\nexample two days afterward. Byzantium also went over to the Lacedæmonians,\r\nwhich enabled them to command the strait. Alcibiades pursued still his\r\ndouble game with Persia and Athens. An Athenian fleet was sent to the\r\nHellespont to contend with the Lacedæmonian squadron, and gained an\r\nincomplete victory at Cynossema, whose only effect was to encourage the\r\nAthenians. The Persians gave substantial aid to the Lacedæmonians,\r\nwithheld for a time by the intrigues of Alcibiades, who returned to Samos,\r\nbut was shortly after seized by Tissaphernes and sent to Sardis, from\r\nwhich he contrived to escape. He partially redeemed his infamy by a\r\nvictory over the Peloponnesian fleet at Cyzicus, and captured it entirely,\r\nwhich disaster induced the Spartans to make overtures of peace, which were\r\nrejected through the influence of Cleophon, the demagogue.\r\n\r\n(M560) The Athenian fleet now reigned alone in the Propontis, the\r\nBosphorus, and the Hellespont, and levied toll on all the ships passing\r\nthrough the straits, while Chrysopolis, opposite to Byzantium, was\r\noccupied by Alcibiades. Athens now once more became hopeful and energetic.\r\nThrasyllus was sent with a large force to Ionia, and joined his forces\r\nwith the fleet which Alcibiades commanded at Sestos, but the conjoined\r\nforces were unable to retake Abydos, which was relieved by Pharnabazus,\r\nthe Persian satrap.\r\n\r\n(M561) The absence of the fleet from Athens encouraged the Lacedæmonians,\r\nwho retook Pylus, B.C. 409, while the Athenians captured Chalcedon, and\r\nthe following year Byzantium itself. Such was the state of the contending\r\nparties when Cyrus the younger was sent by his father Darius as satrap of\r\nLydia, Phrygia, and Cappadocia, and whose command in Asia Minor was\r\nattended by important consequences. Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus were\r\nstill left in command of the coast.\r\n\r\n(M562) Cyrus, a man of great ambition and self-control, came to Asia Minor\r\nwith a fixed purpose of putting down the Athenian power, which for sixty\r\nyears had humbled the pride of the Persian kings. He formed a hearty and\r\ncordial alliance with Lysander, the Spartan admiral, and the most eminent\r\nman, after Brasidas, whom the Lacedæmonians had produced during the war.\r\nHe was a man of severe Spartan discipline and virtue, but ambitious and\r\ncruel. He visited Cyrus at Sardis, was welcomed with every mark of favor,\r\nand induced Cyrus to grant additional pay to every Spartan seaman.\r\n\r\n(M563) Meanwhile Alcibiades re-entered his native city in triumph, after\r\neight years’ exile, and was welcomed by all parties as the only man who\r\nhad sufficient capacity to restore the fallen fortunes of Athens. His\r\nconfiscated property was restored, and he was made captain-general with\r\nample powers, while all his treasons were apparently forgotten, which had\r\nproved so fatal to his country—the sending of Gylippus to Syracuse, the\r\nrevolt of Chios and Miletus, and the conspiracy of the Four Hundred. The\r\neffect of this treatment, so much better than what he deserved,\r\nintoxicated this wayward and unprincipled, but exceedingly able man. His\r\nfirst exploit was to sail to Andros, now under a Lacedæmonian garrison,\r\nwhose fields he devastated, but was unable to take the town. He then went\r\nto Samos, and there learned that all his intrigues with Persia had failed,\r\nand that Persia was allied still more strongly with the Lacedæmonians\r\nunder Lysander.\r\n\r\n(M564) This great general, now at Ephesus, pursued a cautious policy, and\r\nrefused to give battle to the Athenian forces under Alcibiades, who then\r\nretired to Phocæa, leaving his fleet under the command of Antiochus, his\r\nfavorite pilot. Antiochus, in the absence of his general, engaged the\r\nLacedæmonian fleet, but was defeated and slain at Notium. The conduct of\r\nAlcibiades produced great disaffection at Athens. He had sailed with a\r\nfleet not inferior to that which he commanded at Syracuse, and had made\r\ngreat promises of future achievements, yet in three months he had not\r\ngained a single success. He was therefore dismissed from his command,\r\nwhich was given to ten generals, of whom Conon was the most eminent, while\r\nhe retired to the Chersonese. Lysander, at the same time, was superseded\r\nin the command of the Lacedæmonians by Callicratidas, in accordance with\r\nSpartan custom, his term being expired.\r\n\r\n(M565) Callicratidas was not welcomed by Cyrus, and he was also left\r\nwithout funds by Lysander, who returned to the Persians the sums he had\r\nreceived. This conduct so much enraged the Spartan admiral that he sailed\r\nwith his whole fleet—the largest which had been assembled during the war,\r\none hundred and forty triremes, of which only ten were Lacedæmonian—the\r\nrest being furnished by allies—to Lesbos, and liberated the Athenian\r\ncaptives and garrison at Methymna, and seemed animated by that old\r\nPanhellenic patriotism which had united the Greeks half a century before\r\nagainst the Persian invaders, declaring that not a single Greek should be\r\nreduced to slavery if he could help it. But while he was thus actuated by\r\nthese noble sentiments, he also prosecuted the war of his country, which\r\nhad been intrusted to him to conduct. He blocked up the Athenian fleet at\r\nMitylene, which had no provisions to sustain a siege. The Athenians now\r\nmade prodigious efforts to relieve Conon, and one hundred and ten triremes\r\nwere sent from the Piræus, and sailed to Samos. Callicratidas, apprised of\r\nthe approach of the large fleet, went out to meet it. At Arginusæ was\r\nfought a great battle, in which the Spartan admiral was killed, and his\r\nforces completely defeated. Sixty-nine Lacedæmonian ships were destroyed;\r\nthe Athenians lost twenty-five, a severe loss to Greece, since, if\r\nCallicratidas had gained the victory, he would, according to Grote, have\r\nclosed the Peloponnesian war, and united the Greeks once more against\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Arginusæ now gave the Athenians the control of the Asiatic\r\nseas, and so discouraged were the Lacedæmonians, that they were induced to\r\nmake proposals of peace. This is doubted, indeed, by Grote, since no\r\npositive results accrued to Athens.\r\n\r\n(M566) The Chians and other allies of Sparta, in conjunction with Cyrus,\r\nnow sent envoys to the ephors, to request the restoration of Lysander to\r\nthe command of the fleet. They acceded to the request substantially, and\r\nLysander reached Ephesus, B.C. 405, to renovate the Lacedæmonian power and\r\nturn the fortunes of war.\r\n\r\n(M567) The victorious Athenian fleet was now at Ægospotami, in the\r\nHellespont, opposite Lampsacus, having been inactive for nearly a year.\r\nThere the fleet was exposed to imminent danger, which was even seen by\r\nAlcibiades, in his forts opposite, on the Chersonese. He expostulated with\r\nthe Athenian admirals, but to no purpose, and urged them to retire to\r\nSestos. As he feared, the Athenian fleet was surprised, at anchor, on this\r\nopen shore, while the crews were on shore in quest of a meal. One hundred\r\nand seventy triremes were thus ingloriously captured, without the loss of\r\na man—the greatest calamity which had happened to Athens since the\r\nbeginning of the war, and decisive as to its result. The captive generals\r\nwere slaughtered, together with four thousand Athenian prisoners. Conon,\r\nhowever, made his escape. So disgraceful and unnecessary was this great\r\ncalamity, that it is supposed the fleet was betrayed by its own\r\ncommanders; and this supposition is strengthened by its inactivity since\r\nthe battle of Arginusæ. This crowning disaster happened in September, B.C.\r\n405, and caused a dismay at Athens such as had never before been felt—not\r\neven when the Persians were marching through Attica. Nothing was now left\r\nto the miserable city but to make what preparation it could for the siege,\r\nwhich everybody foresaw would soon take place. The walls were put in the\r\nbest defense it was possible, and two of the three ports were blocked up.\r\nNot only was Athens deprived of her maritime power, but her very existence\r\nwas now jeopardized.\r\n\r\n(M568) Lysander was in no haste to march upon Athens, since he knew that\r\nno corn ships could reach the city from the Euxine, and that a famine\r\nwould soon set in. The Athenian empire was annihilated, and nothing\r\nremained but Athens herself! The Athenians now saw that nothing but union\r\nbetween the citizens could give them any hope of success, and they made a\r\nsolemn pledge in the Acropolis to bury their dissensions and cultivate\r\nharmonious feelings.\r\n\r\n(M569) In November, Lysander, with two hundred triremes, blockaded the\r\nPiræus. The whole force of Sparta, under King Pausanias, went out to meet\r\nhim, and encamped at the gates of Athens. The citizens bore the calamity\r\nwith fortitude, and, when they began to die of hunger, sent propositions\r\nfor capitulation. But no proposition was received which did not include\r\nthe demolition of the long walls which Pericles had built. As famine\r\npressed, and the condition of the people had become intolerable, Athens\r\nwas obliged to surrender on the hard conditions that the Piræus should be\r\ndestroyed, the long walls demolished, all foreign possessions evacuated,\r\nall ships surrendered, and, most humiliating of all, that Athens should\r\nbecome the ally of Sparta, and follow her lead upon the sea and upon the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n(M570) Thus fell imperial Athens, after a glorious reign of one hundred\r\nyears. Lysander entered the city as a conqueror. The ships were\r\nsurrendered, all but twelve, which the Athenians were allowed to retain;\r\nthe unfinished ships in the dockyards were burned, the fortifications\r\ndemolished, and the Piræus dismantled. The constitution of the city was\r\nannulled, and a board of thirty was nominated, under the dictation of\r\nLysander, for the government of the city. The conqueror then sailed to\r\nSamos, which was easily reduced, and oligarchy was restored on that\r\nisland, as at Athens.\r\n\r\n(M571) The fall of Athens virtually closed the Peloponnesian war, after a\r\nbitter struggle between the two leading States of Greece for thirty years.\r\nLysander became the leading man in Greece, and wielded a power greater\r\nthan any individual Greek before or after him. Sparta, personified in him,\r\nbecame supreme, and ruled over all the islands, and over the Asiatic and\r\nThracian cities. The tyrants whom he placed over Athens exercised their\r\npower with extreme rigor—sending to execution all who were obnoxious,\r\nseizing as spoil the property of the citizens, and disarming the remaining\r\nhoplites in the city. They even forbade intellectual teaching, and shut\r\nthe mouth of Socrates. Such was Athens, humbled, deprived of her fleet,\r\nand rendered powerless, with a Spartan garrison occupying the Acropolis,\r\nand discord reigning even among the Thirty Tyrants themselves.\r\n\r\n(M572) In considering the downfall of Athens, we perceive that the\r\nunfortunate Sicilian expedition which Alcibiades had stimulated proved the\r\nmain cause. Her maritime supremacy might have been maintained but for this\r\naggression, which Pericles never would have sanctioned, and which Nicias\r\nso earnestly disapproved. After that disaster, the conditions of the State\r\nwere totally changed, and it was a bitter and desperate struggle to retain\r\nthe fragments of empire. And the catastrophe proved, ultimately, the\r\npolitical ruin of Greece herself, since there was left no one State\r\nsufficiently powerful to resist foreign attacks. The glory of Athens was\r\nher navy, and this being destroyed, Greece was open to invasion, and to\r\nthe corruption brought about by Persian gold. It was Athens which had\r\nresisted Persia, and protected the maritime States and islands. When\r\nAthens was crippled, the decline of the other States was rapid, for they\r\nhad all exhausted themselves in the war. And the war itself has few\r\nredeeming features. It was a wicked contest carried on by rivalry and\r\njealousy. And it produced, as war generally does, a class of unprincipled\r\nmen who aggrandize themselves at the expense of their country. Nothing but\r\nwar would have developed such men as Alcibiades and Lysander, and it is\r\ndifficult to say which of the two brought the greatest dishonor on their\r\nrespective States. Both were ambitious, and both hoped to gain an\r\nascendency incompatible with free institutions. To my mind, Alcibiades is\r\nthe worst man in Grecian history, and not only personally disgraced by the\r\nworst vices, but his influence was disastrous on his country. Athens owed\r\nher political degradation more to him than any other man. He was insolent,\r\nlawless, extravagant, and unscrupulous, from his first appearance in\r\npublic life. He incited the Sicilian expedition, and caused it to end\r\ndisastrously by sending Gylippus to Syracuse. He originated the revolt of\r\nChios and Miletus, the fortification of Decelea, and the conspiracy of the\r\nFour Hundred. And though he partially redeemed his treason by his three\r\nyears’ services, after his exile, yet his vanity, and intrigues, and\r\nprodigality prevented him from accomplishing what he promised. It is true\r\nhe was a man of great resources, and was never defeated either by sea or\r\nland; “and he was the first man in every party he espoused—Athenian,\r\nSpartan, or Persian, oligarchial or democratical, but he never inspired\r\nconfidence with any party, and all parties successively threw him off.”\r\nThe end of such a man proclaims the avenging Nemesis in this world. He\r\ndied by the hands of Persian assassins at the instance of both Lysander\r\nand Cyrus, who felt that there could be nothing settled so long as this\r\nrestless schemer lived. And he died, unlamented and unhonored, in spite of\r\nhis high birth, wealth, talents, and personal accomplishments.\r\n\r\n(M573) Lysander was more fortunate; he gained a great ascendency in\r\nSparta, but his ambition proved ruinous to his country, by involving it in\r\nthose desperate wars which are yet to be presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH OF CYRUS AND RETREAT OF THE TEN THOUSAND GREEKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M574) The Peloponnesian war being closed, a large body of Grecian\r\nsoldiers were disbanded, but rendered venal and restless by the\r\nexcitements and changes of the past thirty years, and ready to embark in\r\nany warlike enterprise that promised money and spoil. They were unfitted,\r\nas is usually the case, for sober and industrial pursuits. They panted for\r\nfresh adventures.\r\n\r\n(M575) This restless passion which war ever kindles, found vent and\r\ndirection in the enterprise which Cyrus led from Western Asia to dethrone\r\nhis brother Artaxerxes from the throne of Persia. Some fourteen thousand\r\nGreeks from different States joined his standard—not with a view of a\r\nmarch to Babylon and an attack on the great king, but to conquer and root\r\nout the Pisidian mountaineers, who did much mischief from their fastnesses\r\nin the southeast of Asia Minor. This was the ostensible object of Cyrus,\r\nand he found no difficulty in enlisting Grecian mercenaries, under promise\r\nof large rewards. All these Greeks were deceived but one man, to whom\r\nalone Cyrus revealed his real purpose. This was Clearchus, a Lacedæmonian\r\ngeneral of considerable ability and experience, who had been banished for\r\nabuse of authority at Byzantium, which he commanded. He repaired to Sardis\r\nand offered his services to Cyrus, who had been sent thither by his father\r\nDarius to command the Persian forces. Cyrus accepted the overtures of\r\nClearchus, who secured his confidence so completely that he gave him the\r\nlarge sum of ten thousand darics, which he employed in hiring Grecian\r\nmercenaries.\r\n\r\n(M576) Other Greeks of note also joined the army of Cyrus with a view of\r\nbeing employed against the Pisidians. Among them were Aristippus and\r\nMenon, of a distinguished family in Thessaly; Proxenus, a Bœotian; Agis,\r\nan Arcadian; Socrates, an Achæan, who were employed to collect\r\nmercenaries, and who received large sums of money. A considerable body of\r\nLacedæmonians were also taken under pay.\r\n\r\nThe march of these men to Babylon, and their successful retreat, form one\r\nof the most interesting episodes in Grecian history, and it is this march\r\nand retreat which I purpose briefly to present.\r\n\r\n(M577) Cyrus was an extraordinary man. The younger son of the Persian\r\nking, he aimed to secure the sovereignty of Persia, which fell to his\r\nelder brother, Artaxerxes, on the death of Darius. During his residence at\r\nSardis, as satrap or governor, he perceived and felt the great superiority\r\nof the Greeks to his own countrymen, not only intellectually, but as\r\nsoldiers. He was brave, generous, frank, and ambitious. Had it been his\r\nfortune to have achieved the object of his ambition, the whole history of\r\nPersia would have been changed, and Alexander would have lived in vain.\r\nPerceiving and appreciating the great qualities of the Greeks, and\r\nlearning how to influence them, he sought, by their aid, to conquer his\r\nway to the throne.\r\n\r\n(M578) But he dissembled his designs so that they were not suspected, even\r\nin Persia. As has been remarked, he communicated them only to the Spartan\r\ngeneral, Clearchus. Neither Greek nor Persian divined his object as he\r\ncollected a great army at Sardis. At first he employed his forces in the\r\nsiege of Miletus and other enterprises, which provoked no suspicion of his\r\nreal designs.\r\n\r\n(M579) When all was ready, he commenced his march from Sardis, in March,\r\nB.C. 401, with about eight thousand Grecian hoplites and one hundred\r\nthousand native troops, while a joint Lacedæmonian and Persian fleet\r\ncoasted around the south of Asia Minor to co-operate with the land forces.\r\n\r\n(M580) These Greeks who thus joined his standard under promise of large\r\npay, and were unwittingly about to plunge into unknown perils, were not\r\noutcasts and paupers, but were men of position, reputation, and, in some\r\ncases, of wealth. About half of them were Arcadians. Young men of good\r\nfamily, ennuied of home, restless and adventurous, formed the greater\r\npart, although many of mature age had been induced by liberal offers to\r\nleave their wives and children. They simply calculated on a year’s\r\ncampaign in Pisidia, from which they would return to their homes enriched.\r\nSo they were assured by the Greek commanders at Sardis, and so these\r\ncommanders believed, for Cyrus stood high in popular estimation for\r\nliberality and good faith.\r\n\r\n(M581) Among other illustrious Greeks that were thus to be led so far from\r\nhome was Xenophon, the Athenian historian, who was induced by his friend\r\nProxenus, of Bœotia, to join the expedition. He was of high family, and a\r\npupil of Socrates, but embarked against the wishes and advice of his\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nWhen the siege of Miletus was abandoned, and Cyrus began his march, his\r\nobject was divined by the satrap Tissaphernes, who hastened to Persia to\r\nput the king on his guard.\r\n\r\n(M582) At Celenæ, or Kelænæ, a Phrygian city, Cyrus halted and reviewed\r\nhis army. Grecian re-enforcements here joined him, which swelled the\r\nnumber of Greeks to thirteen thousand men, of whom eleven thousand were\r\nhoplites. As this city was on the way to Pisidia, no mistrust existed as\r\nto the object of the expedition, not even when the army passed into\r\nLycaonia, since its inhabitants were of the same predatory character as\r\nthe Pisidians. But when it had crossed Mount Taurus, which bounded\r\nCilicia, and reached Tarsus, the Greeks perceived that they had been\r\ncheated, and refused to advance farther. Clearchus attempted to suppress\r\nthe mutiny by severe measures, but failed. He then resorted to stratagem,\r\nand pretended to yield to the wishes of the Greeks, and likewise refused\r\nto march, but sent a secret dispatch to Cyrus that all would be well in\r\nthe end, and requested him to send fresh invitations, that he might answer\r\nby fresh refusals. He then, with the characteristic cunning and eloquence\r\nof a Greek, made known to his countrymen the extreme peril of making Cyrus\r\ntheir enemy in a hostile country, where retreat was beset with so many\r\ndangers, and induced them to proceed. So the army continued its march to\r\nIssus, at the extremity of the Issican Gulf, and near the mountains which\r\nseparate Cilicia from Syria. Here Cyrus was further re-enforced, making\r\nthe grand total of Greeks in his army fourteen thousand.\r\n\r\n(M583) He expected to find the passes over the mountains, a day’s journey\r\nfrom Issus, defended, but the Persian general Abrocomas fled at his\r\napproach, and Cyrus easily crossed into Syria by the pass of Beilan, over\r\nMount Amanus. He then proceeded south to Myriandus, a Phœnician maritime\r\ntown, where he parted from his fleet. Eight days’ march brought his army\r\nto Thapsacus, on the Euphrates, where he remained five days to refresh his\r\ntroops. Here again the Greeks showed a reluctance to proceed, but, on the\r\npromise of five minæ a head, nearly one hundred dollars more than a year’s\r\npay, they consented to advance. It was here Cyrus crossed the river\r\nunobstructed, and continued his march on the left bank for nine days,\r\nuntil he came to the river Araxes, which separates Syria from Arabia. Thus\r\nfar his army was well supplied with provisions from the numerous villages\r\nthrough which they passed; but now he entered a desert country, entirely\r\nwithout cultivation, where the astonished Greeks beheld for the first time\r\nwild asses, antelopes, and ostriches. For eighteen days the army marched\r\nwithout other provisions than what they brought with them, parched with\r\nthirst and exhausted by heat. At Pylæ they reached the cultivated\r\nterritory of Babylonia, and the alluvial plains commenced. Three days’\r\nfurther march brought them to Cunaxa, about seventy miles from Babylon,\r\nwhere the army of Artaxerxes was marshaled to meet them. It was an immense\r\nforce of more than a million of men, besides six thousand horse-guards and\r\ntwo hundred chariots. But so confident was Cyrus of the vast superiority\r\nof the Greeks and their warfare, that he did not hesitate to engage the\r\noverwhelming forces of his brother with only ten thousand Greeks and one\r\nhundred thousand Asiatics. The battle of Cunaxa was fatal to Cyrus; he was\r\nslain and his camp was pillaged. The expedition had failed.\r\n\r\n(M584) Dismay now seized the Greeks, as well it might—a handful of men in\r\nthe midst of innumerable enemies, and in the very centre of the Persian\r\nempire. But such men are not driven to despair. They refused to surrender,\r\nand make up their minds to retreat—to find their way back again to Greece,\r\nsince all aggressive measures was madness.\r\n\r\nThis retreat, amid so many difficulties, and against such powerful and\r\nnumerous enemies, is one of the most gallant actions in the history of\r\nwar, and has made those ten thousand men immortal.\r\n\r\n(M585) Ariæus, who commanded the Asiatic forces on the left wing of the\r\narmy at the battle of Cunaxa, joined the Greeks with what force remained,\r\nin retreat, and promised to guide them to the Asiatic coast, not by the\r\nroute which Cyrus had taken, for this was now impracticable, but by a\r\nlonger one, up the course of the Tigris, through Armenia, to the Euxine\r\nSea. The Greeks had marched ninety days from Sardis, about fourteen\r\nhundred and sixty-four English miles, and rested ninety-six days in\r\nvarious places. Six months had been spent on the expedition, and it would\r\ntake more than that time to return, considering the new difficulties which\r\nit was necessary to surmount. The condition of the Greeks, to all\r\nappearance, was hopeless. How were they to ford rivers and cross\r\nmountains, with a hostile cavalry in their rear, without supplies, without\r\na knowledge of roads, without trustworthy guides, through hostile\r\nterritories?\r\n\r\n(M586) The Persians still continued their negotiations, regarding the\r\nadvance or retreat of the Greeks alike impossible, and curious to learn\r\nwhat motives had brought them so far from home. They replied that they had\r\nbeen deceived, that they had no hostility to the Persian king, that they\r\nhad been ashamed to desert Cyrus in the midst of danger, and that they now\r\ndesired only to return home peaceably, but were prepared to repel\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\n(M587) It was not pleasant to the Persian monarch to have thirteen\r\nthousand Grecian veterans, whose prestige was immense, and whose power was\r\nreally formidable, in the heart of the kingdom. It was not easy to conquer\r\nsuch brave men, reduced to desperation, without immense losses and\r\nprobable humiliation. So the Persians dissembled. It was their object to\r\nget the Greeks out of Babylonia, where they could easily intrench and\r\nsupport themselves, and then attack them at a disadvantage. So\r\nTissaphernes agreed to conduct them home by a different route. They\r\nacceded to his proposal, and he led them to the banks of the Tigris, and\r\nadvanced on its left bank, north to the Great Zab River, about two hundred\r\nmiles from Babylon. The Persians marched in advance, and the Greeks about\r\nthree miles in the rear. At the Great Zab they halted three days, and then\r\nTissaphernes enticed the Greek generals to his tent, ostensibly to feast\r\nthem and renew negotiations. There they were seized, sent prisoners to the\r\nPersian court, and treacherously murdered.\r\n\r\n(M588) Utter despair now seized the Greeks. They were deprived of their\r\ngenerals, in the heart of Media, with unscrupulous enemies in the rear,\r\nand the mountains of Armenia in their front, whose passes were defended by\r\nhostile barbarians, and this in the depth of winter, deprived of guides,\r\nand exposed to every kind of hardship, difficulty, and danger. They were\r\napparently in the hands of their enemies, without any probability of\r\nescape. They were then summoned to surrender to the Persians, but they\r\nresolved to fight their way home, great as were their dangers and\r\ninsurmountable the difficulties—a most heroic resolution. And their\r\nretreat, under these circumstances, to the Euxine, is the most\r\nextraordinary march in the whole history of war.\r\n\r\n(M589) But a great man appeared, in this crisis, to lead them, whose\r\nprudence, sagacity, moderation, and courage can never be sufficiently\r\npraised, and his successful retreat places him in the ranks of the great\r\ngenerals of the world. Xenophon, the Athenian historian, now appears upon\r\nthe stage with all those noble qualities which inspired the heroes at the\r\nsiege of Troy—a man as religious as he was brave and magnanimous, and\r\neloquent even for a Greek. He summoned together the captains, and\r\npersuaded them to advance, giving the assurance of the protection of Zeus.\r\nHe then convened the army, and inspired them by his spirit, with\r\nsurpassing eloquence, and acquired the ascendency of a Moses by his\r\ngenius, piety, and wisdom. His military rank was not great, but in such an\r\nemergency talents and virtues have more force than rank.\r\n\r\n(M590) So, under his leadership, the Greeks crossed the Zab, and resumed\r\ntheir march to the north, harassed by Persian cavalry, and subjected to\r\ngreat privations. The army no longer marched, as was usual, in one\r\nundivided hollow square, but in small companies, for they were obliged to\r\ncross mountains and ford rivers. So long as they marched on the banks of\r\nthe Tigris, they found well-stocked villages, from which they obtained\r\nsupplies; but as they entered the country of the Carducians, they were\r\nobliged to leave the Tigris to their left, and cross the high mountains\r\nwhich divided it from Armenia. They were also compelled to burn their\r\nbaggage, for the roads were nearly impassable, not only on account of the\r\nnarrow defiles, but from the vast quantities of snow which fell. Their\r\nsituation was full of peril, and fatigue, and privation. Still they\r\npersevered, animated by the example and eloquence of their intrepid\r\nleader. At every new pass they were obliged to fight a battle, but the\r\nenemies they encountered could not withstand their arms in close combat,\r\nand usually fled, contented to harass them by rolling stones down the\r\nmountains on their heads, and discharging their long arrows.\r\n\r\n(M591) The march through Armenia was still more difficult, for the\r\ninhabitants were more warlike and hardy, and the passage more difficult.\r\nThey also were sorely troubled for lack of guides. The sufferings of the\r\nGreeks were intense from cold and privation. The beasts of burden perished\r\nin the snow, while the soldiers were frost-bitten and famished. It was\r\ntheir good fortune to find villages, after several days’ march, where they\r\nhalted and rested, but assailed all the while by hostile bands. Yet onward\r\nthey pressed, wearied and hungry, through the country of the Taochi, of\r\nthe Chalybes, of the Scytheni, of the Marones, of the Colchians, and\r\nreached Trapezus (Trebizond) in safety. The sight of the sea filled the\r\nGreeks with indescribable joy after so many perils, for the sea was their\r\nown element, and they could now pursue their way in ships rather than by\r\nperilous marches.\r\n\r\n(M592) But the delays were long and dreary. There were no ships to\r\ntransport the warriors to Byzantium. They were exposed to new troubles\r\nfrom the indifference or hostility of the cities on the Euxine, for so\r\nlarge a force created alarm. And when the most pressing dangers were\r\npassed, the license of the men broke out, so that it was difficult to\r\npreserve order and prevent them from robbing their friends. They were\r\nobliged to resort to marauding expeditions among the Asiatic people, and\r\nit was difficult to support themselves. Not being able to get ships, they\r\nmarched along the coast to Cotyora, exposed to incessant hostilities. It\r\nwas now the desire of Xenophon to found a new city on the Euxine with the\r\narmy; but the army was eager to return home, and did not accede to the\r\nproposal. Clamors arose against the general who had led them so gloriously\r\nfrom the heart of Media, and his speeches in his defense are among the\r\nmost eloquent on Grecian record. He remonstrated against the disorders of\r\nthe army, and had sufficient influence to secure reform, and completely\r\ntriumphed over faction as he had over danger.\r\n\r\n(M593) At last ships were provided, and the army passed by sea to Sinope—a\r\nGrecian colony—where the men were hospitably received, and fed, and\r\nlodged. From thence the army passed by sea to Heracleia, where the\r\nsoldiers sought to extort money against the opposition of Xenophon and\r\nCherisophus, the latter of whom had nobly seconded the plans of Xenophon,\r\nalthough a Spartan of superior military rank. The army, at this\r\nopposition, divided into three factions, but on suffering new disasters,\r\nreunited. It made a halt at Calpe, where new disorders broke out. Then\r\nCleander, Spartan governor of Byzantium, arrived with two triremes, who\r\npromised to conduct the army, and took command of it, but subsequently\r\nthrew up his command from the unpropitious sacrifices. Nothing proved the\r\nreligious character of the Greeks so forcibly as their scrupulous\r\nattention to the rites imposed by their pagan faith. They undertook no\r\nenterprise of importance without sacrifices to the gods, and if the\r\nauguries were unfavorable, they relinquished their most cherished objects.\r\n\r\n(M594) From Calpe the army marched to Chalcedon, turning into money the\r\nslaves and plunder which it had collected. There it remained seven days.\r\nBut nothing could be done without the consent of the Spartan admiral at\r\nByzantium, Anaxibius, since the Lacedæmonians were the masters of Greece\r\nboth by sea and land. This man was bribed by the Persian satrap\r\nPharnabazus, who commanded the north-western region of Asia Minor, to\r\ntransport the army to the European side of the Bosphorus. It accordingly\r\ncrossed to Byzantium, but was not allowed to halt in the city, or even to\r\nenter the gates.\r\n\r\n(M595) The wrath of the soldiers was boundless when they were thus\r\nexcluded from Byzantium. They rushed into the town and took possession,\r\nwhich conduct gave grave apprehension to Xenophon, who mustered and\r\nharangued the army, and thus prevented anticipated violence. They at\r\nlength consented to leave the city, and accepted the services of the\r\nTheban Coeratidas, who promised to conduct them to the Delta of Thrace,\r\nfor purposes of plunder, but he was soon dismissed. After various\r\nmisfortunes the soldiers at length were taken under the pay of Seuthes, a\r\nThracian prince, who sought the recovery of his principality, but who\r\ncheated them out of their pay. A change of policy among the Lacedæmonians\r\nled to the conveyance of the Cyrenian army into Asia in order to make war\r\non the satraps. Xenophon accordingly conducted his troops, now reduced to\r\nsix thousand men, over Mount Ida to Pergamus. He succeeded in capturing\r\nthe Persian general Asidates, and securing a valuable booty, B.C. 399. The\r\nsoldiers whom he had led were now incorporated with the Lacedæmonian army\r\nin Asia, and Xenophon himself enlisted in the Spartan service. His\r\nsubsequent fortunes we have not room to present. An exile from Athens, he\r\nsettled in Scillus, near Olympia, with abundant wealth, but ultimately\r\nreturned to his native city after the battle of Leuctra.\r\n\r\n(M596) The impression produced on the Grecian mind by the successful\r\nretreat of the Ten Thousand was profound and lasting. Its most obvious\r\neffect was to produce contempt for Persian armies and Persian generals,\r\nand to show that Persia was only strong by employing Hellenic strength\r\nagainst the Hellenic cause. The real weakness of Persia was thus revealed\r\nto the Greeks, and sentiments were fostered which two generations\r\nafterward led to the expeditions of Alexander and the subjection of Asia\r\nto Grecian rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LACEDÆMONIAN EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M597) I have already shown that Sparta, after a battle with the Argives,\r\nB.C. 547, obtained the ascendency in the southern part of the\r\nPeloponnesus, and became the leading military State of Greece. This\r\nprestige and power were not lost. The severe simplicity of Spartan life,\r\nthe rigor of political and social institutions, the aristocratic form of\r\ngovernment, and above all the military spirit and ambition, gave\r\npermanence to all conquests, so that in the Persian wars Sparta took the\r\nload of the land forces. The great rival power of Sparta was Athens, but\r\nthis was founded on maritime skill and enterprise. It was to the navy of\r\nAthens, next after the hoplites of Sparta, that the successful resistance\r\nto the empire of Persia may be attributed.\r\n\r\n(M598) After the Persian wars the rivalship between Athens and Sparta is\r\nthe most prominent feature in Grecian history. The confederacy of Delos\r\ngave to Athens supremacy over the sea, and the great commercial prosperity\r\nof Athens under Pericles, and the empire gained over the Ionian colonies\r\nand the islands of the Ægaean, made Athens, perhaps, the leading State. It\r\nwas the richest, the most cultivated, and the most influential of the\r\nGrecian States, and threatened to absorb gradually all the other States of\r\nGreece in her empire.\r\n\r\n(M599) This ascendency and rapid growth in wealth and power were beheld\r\nwith jealous eyes, not only by Sparta, but other States which she\r\ncontrolled, or with which she was in alliance. The consequence was, the\r\nPeloponnesian war, which lasted half a generation, and which, after\r\nvarious vicissitudes and fortunes, terminated auspiciously for Sparta, but\r\ndisastrously to Greece as a united nation. The Persian wars bound all the\r\nStates together by a powerful Hellenic sentiment of patriotism. The\r\nPeloponnesian war dissevered this Panhellenic tie. The disaster at\r\nSyracuse was fatal to Athenian supremacy, and even independence. But for\r\nthis Athens might have remained the great power of Greece. The democratic\r\norganization of the government gave great vigor and enterprise to all the\r\nambitious projects of Athens. If Alcibiades had lent his vast talents to\r\nthe building up of his native State, even then the fortunes of Athens\r\nmight have been different. But he was a traitor, and threw all his\r\nenergies on the side of Sparta, until it was too late for Athens to\r\nrecover the prestige she had won. He partially redeemed his honor, but had\r\nhe been animated by the spirit of Pericles or Nicias, to say nothing of\r\nthe self-devotion of Miltiades, he might have raised the power of Athens\r\nto a height which nothing could have resisted.\r\n\r\n(M600) Lysander completed the war which Brasidas had so nobly carried on,\r\nand took possession of Athens, abolished the democratic constitution,\r\ndemolished the walls, and set up, as his creatures, a set of tyrants, and\r\nalso a Spartan governor in Athens. Under Lysander, the Lacedæmonian rule\r\nwas paramount in Greece. At one time, he had more power than any man in\r\nGreece ever enjoyed. He undertook to change the government of the allied\r\ncities, and there was scarcely a city in Greece where the Spartans had not\r\nthe ascendency. In most of the Ionian cities, and in all the cities which\r\nhad taken the side of Athens, there was a Spartan governor, so that when\r\nXenophon returned with his Ten Thousand to Asia Minor, he found he could\r\ndo nothing without the consent of the Spartan governors. Moreover, the\r\nrule of Sparta was hostile to all democratic governments. She sought to\r\nestablish oligarchal institutions everywhere. Perhaps this difference\r\nbetween Athens and Sparta respecting government was one great cause of tho\r\nPeloponnesian war.\r\n\r\n(M601) But the same envy which had once existed among the Grecian States\r\nof the prosperity of Athens, was now turned upon Sparta. Her rule was\r\narrogant and hard and she in turn had to experience the humiliation of\r\nrevolt from her domination. “The allies of Sparta,” says Grote,\r\n“especially Corinth and Thebes, not only relented in their hatred of\r\nAthens, now she had lost her power, but even sympathized with her\r\nsuffering exiles, and became disgusted with the self-willed encroachments\r\nof Sparta; while the Spartan king, Pausanias, together with some of the\r\nephors, were also jealous of the arbitrary and oppressive conduct of\r\nLysander. He refused to prevent the revival of the democracy. It was in\r\nthis manner that Athens, rescued from that sanguinary and rapacious\r\n_régime_ of the Thirty Tyrants, was enabled to reappear as a humble and\r\ndependent member of the Spartan alliance—with nothing but the recollection\r\nof her former power, yet with her democracy again in vigorous action for\r\ninternal government.”\r\n\r\n(M602) The victory of Ægospotami, which annihilated the Athenian navy,\r\nushered in the supremacy of Sparta, both on the land and sea, and all\r\nGreece made submission to the ascendant power. Lysander established in\r\nmost of the cities an oligarchy of ten citizens, as well as a Spartan\r\nharmost, or governor. Everywhere the Lysandrian dekarchy superseded the\r\nprevious governments, and ruled oppressively, like the Thirty at Athens,\r\nwith Critias at their head. And no justice could be obtained at Sparta\r\nagainst the bad conduct of the harmosts who now domineered in every city.\r\nSparta had embroiled Greece in war to put down the ascendency of Athens,\r\nbut exercised a more tyrannical usurpation than Athens ever meditated. The\r\nlanguage of Brasidas, who promised every thing, was in striking contrast\r\nto the conduct of Lysander, who put his foot on the neck of Greece.\r\n\r\n(M603) The rule of the Thirty at Athens came to an end by the noble\r\nefforts of Thrasybulus and the Athenian democracy, and the old\r\nconstitution was restored because the Spartan king was disgusted with the\r\nusurpations and arrogance of Lysander, and forbore to interfere. Had\r\nSparta been wise, with this vast accession of power gained by the\r\nvictories of Lysander, she would have ruled moderately, and reorganized\r\nthe Grecian world on sound principles, and restored a Panhellenic\r\nstability and harmony. She might not have restored, as Brasidas had\r\npromised, a universal autonomy, or the complete independence of all the\r\ncities, but would have bound together all the States under her presidency,\r\nby a just and moderate rule. But Sparta had not this wisdom. She was\r\nnarrow, hard, and extortionate. She loved her own, as selfish people\r\ngenerally do, but nothing outside her territory with any true magnanimity.\r\nAnd she thus provoked her allies into rebellion, so that her chance was\r\nlost, and her dominion short-lived. Athens would have been more\r\nenlightened, but she never had the power, as Sparta had, of organizing a\r\ngeneral Panhellenic combination. The nearest approach which Athens ever\r\nmade was the confederacy of Delos, which did not work well, from the\r\njealousy of the cities. But Sparta soon made herself more unpopular than\r\nAthens ever was, and her dream of empire was short.\r\n\r\n(M604) The first great movement of Sparta, after the establishment of\r\noligarchy in all the cities which yielded to her, was a renewal of the war\r\nwith Persia. The Asiatic Greek cities had been surrendered to Persia\r\naccording to treaty, as the price for the assistance which Persia rendered\r\nto Sparta in the war with Athens. But the Persian rule, under the satraps,\r\nespecially of Tissaphernes, who had been rewarded by Artaxerxes with more\r\npower than before, became oppressive and intolerable. Nothing but\r\naggravated slavery impended over them. They therefore sent to Sparta for\r\naid to throw off the Persian yoke. The ephors, with nothing more to gain\r\nfrom Persia, and inspired with contempt for the Persian armies—contempt\r\ncreated by the expedition of the Ten Thousand—readily listened to the\r\novertures, and sent a considerable force into Asia, under Thimbron. He had\r\npoor success, and was recalled, and Dereyllidas was sent in his stead. He\r\nmade a truce with Tissaphernes, in order to attack Pharnabazus, against\r\nwhom he had an old grudge, and with whom Tissaphernes himself happened for\r\nthe time to be on ill terms. Dereyllidas overrun the satrapy of\r\nPharnabazus, took immense spoil, and took up winter-quarters in Bythinia.\r\nMaking a truce with Pharnabazus, he crossed over into Europe and fortified\r\nthe Chersonesus against the Thracians. He then renewed the war both\r\nagainst Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes upon the Mæander, the result of which\r\nwas an agreement, on the part of the satraps, to exempt the Grecian cities\r\nfrom tribute and political interference, while the Spartan general\r\npromised to withdraw from Asia his army, and the Spartan governors from\r\nthe Grecian cities.\r\n\r\n(M605) At this point, B.C. 397, Dercyllidas was recalled to Sparta, and\r\nKing Agesilaus, who had recently arrived with large re-enforcements,\r\nsuperseded him in command of the Lacedæmonian army. Agesilaus was the son\r\nof king Archidamus, and half-brother to King Agis. He was about forty when\r\nhe became king, through the influence of Lysamler, in preference to his\r\nnephew, and having been brought up without prospects of the throne, had\r\npassed through the unmitigated rigor of the Spartan drill and training. He\r\nwas distinguished for all the Spartan virtues—obedience to authority,\r\nextraordinary courage and energy, simplicity and frugality.\r\n\r\n(M606) Agesilaus was assisted by large contingents from the allied Greek\r\ncities for his war in Asia; but Athens, Corinth, and Thebes stood aloof.\r\nLysander accompanied him as one of the generals, but gave so great offense\r\nby his overweening arrogance, that he was sent to command at the\r\nHellespont. The truce between the Spartans and Persians being broken,\r\nAgesilaus prosecuted the war vigorously against both Tissaphernes and\r\nPharnabazus. He gained a considerable victory over the Persians near\r\nSardis, invaded Phrygia, and laid waste the satrapy of Pharnabazus. He\r\neven surprised the camp of the satrap, and gained immense booty. But in\r\nthe midst of his victories he was recalled by Sparta, which had need of\r\nhis services at home. A rebellion of the allies had broken out, which\r\nseriously threatened the stability of the Spartan empire.\r\n\r\n(M607) “The prostration of the power of Athens had removed that common\r\nbond of hatred and alarm which attached the allied cities to the headship\r\nof Sparta; while her subsequent conduct had given positive offense, and\r\nhad excited against herself the same fear of unmeasured imperial ambition\r\nwhich had before run so powerfully against Athens. She had appropriated to\r\nherself nearly the whole of the Athenian maritime empire, with a tribute\r\nof one thousand talents. But while Sparta had gained so much by the war,\r\nnot one of her allies had received the smallest remuneration. Even the\r\nfour hundred and seventy talents which Lysander brought home out of the\r\nadvances made by Cyrus, together with the booty acquired at Decelea, was\r\nall detained by the Lacedæmonians. Hence there arose among the allies not\r\nonly a fear of the grasping dominion, but a hatred of the monopolizing\r\nrapacity of Sparta. This was manifested by the Thebans and Corinthians\r\nwhen they refused to join Pausanias in his march against Thrasybulus and\r\nthe Athenian exiles in Piræus. But the Lacedæmonians were strong enough to\r\ndespise this alienation of the allies, and even to take revenge on such as\r\nincurred their displeasure. Among these were the Elians, whose territory\r\nthey invaded, but which they retreated from, on the appearance of an\r\nearthquake.”\r\n\r\nThe following year the Spartans, under King Agis, again invaded the\r\nterritory of Elis, enriched by the offerings made to the temple of\r\nOlympeia. Immense booty in slaves, cattle, and provisions was the result\r\nof this invasion, provoked by the refusal of the Elians to furnish aid in\r\nthe war against Athens. The Elians were obliged to submit to hard terms of\r\npeace, and all the enemies of Sparta were rooted out of the Peloponnesus.\r\n\r\n(M608) Such was the triumphant position of Sparta at the close of the\r\nPeloponnesian war. And a great change had also taken place in her internal\r\naffairs. The people had become enriched by successful war, and gold and\r\nsilver were admitted against the old institution of Lycurgus, which\r\nrecognized only iron money. The public men were enriched by bribes. The\r\nstrictness of the old rule of Spartan discipline was gradually relaxed.\r\n\r\n(M609) It was then, shortly after the accession of Agesilaus to the\r\nthrone, on the death of Agis, that a dangerous conspiracy broke out in\r\nSparta itself, headed by Cinadon, a man of strength and courage, who saw\r\nthat men of his class were excluded from the honors and distinctions of\r\nthe State by the oligarchy—the ephors and the senate. But the rebellion,\r\nthough put down by the energy of Agesilaus, still produced a dangerous\r\ndiscontent which weakened the power of the State.\r\n\r\n(M610) The Lacedæmonian naval power, at this crisis, was seriously\r\nthreatened by the union of the Persian and Athenian fleet under Conon.\r\nThat remarkable man had escaped from the disaster of Ægospotami with eight\r\ntriremes, and sought the shelter of Cyprus, governed by his friend\r\nEvagoras, where he remained until the war between Sparta and the Persians\r\ngave a new direction to his enterprising genius. He joined Pharnabazus,\r\nenraged with the Spartans on account of the invasion of his satrapy by\r\nLysander and Agesilaus, and by him was intrusted with the command of the\r\nPersian fleet. He succeeded in detaching Rhodes from the Spartan alliance,\r\nand gained, some time after, a decisive victory over Pisander—the Spartan\r\nadmiral, off Cnidus, which weakened the power of Sparta on the sea, B.C.\r\n394. More than half of the Spartan ships were captured and destroyed.\r\n\r\n(M611) This great success emboldened Thebes and other States to throw off\r\nthe Spartan yoke. Lysander was detached from his command at the Hellespont\r\nto act against Bœotia, while Pausanias conducted an army from the\r\nPeloponnesus. The Thebans, threatened by the whole power of Sparta,\r\napplied to Athens, and Athens responded, no longer under the control of\r\nthe Thirty Tyrants. Lysander was killed before Haliartus, an irreparable\r\nblow to Sparta, since he was her ablest general. Pausanias was compelled\r\nto evacuate Bœotia, and the enemies of Sparta took courage. An alliance\r\nbetween Athens, Corinth, Thebes, and Argos was now made to carry on war\r\nagainst Sparta.\r\n\r\n(M612) Thebes at this time steps from the rank of a secondary power, and\r\ngradually rises to the rank of an ascendant city. Her leading citizen was\r\nIsmenias, one of the great organizers of the anti-Spartan movement—the\r\nprecursor of Pelopidas and Epaminondas. He conducted successful operations\r\nin the northern part of Bœotia, and captured Heracleia.\r\n\r\n(M613) Such successes induced the Lacedæmonians to recall Agesilaus from\r\nAsia, and to concentrate all their forces against this new alliance, of\r\nwhich Thebes and Corinth were then the most powerful cities. The allied\r\nforces were also considerable—some twenty-four thousand hoplites, besides\r\nlight troops and cavalry, and these were mustered at Corinth, where they\r\ntook up a defensive position. The Lacedæmonians advanced to attack them,\r\nand gained an indecisive victory, B.C. 394, which secured their ascendency\r\nwithin the Peloponnesus, but no further. Agesilaus advanced from Asia\r\nthrough Thrace to co-operate, but learned, on the confines of Bœotia, the\r\nnews of the great battle of Cnidus. At Coronæa another battle was fought\r\nbetween the Spartan and anti-Spartan forces, which was also indecisive,\r\nbut in which the Thebans displayed great heroism. This battle compelled\r\nAgesilaus, with the Spartan forces, which he commanded, to retire from\r\nBœotia.\r\n\r\n(M614) This battle was a moral defeat to Sparta. Nearly all her maritime\r\nallies deserted her—all but Abydos, which was held by the celebrated\r\nDercyllidas. Pharnabazus and Conon now sailed with their fleet to Corinth,\r\nbut the Persian satrap soon left and Conon remained sole admiral, assisted\r\nwith Persian money. With this aid he rebuilt the long walls of Athens,\r\nwith the hearty co-operation of those allies which had once been opposed\r\nto Athens.\r\n\r\n(M615) Conon had large plans for the restoration of the Athenian power. He\r\norganized a large mercenary force at Corinth, which had now become the\r\nseat of war. But as many evils resulted from the presence of so many\r\nsoldiers in the city, a conspiracy headed by the oligarchal party took\r\nplace, with a view of restoring the Lacedæmonian power. Pasimelus, the\r\nhead of the conspirators, admitted the enemy within the long walls of the\r\ncity, which, as in Athens, secured a communication between the city and\r\nthe port. And between these walls a battle took place, in which the\r\nLacedæmonians were victorious with a severe loss. They pulled down a\r\nportion of the walls between Corinth and the port of Lechæum, sallied\r\nforth, and captured two Corinthian dependencies, but the city of Corinth\r\nremained in the hands of their gallant defenders, under the Athenian\r\nIphicrates. The long walls were soon restored, by aid of the Athenians,\r\nbut were again retaken by Agesilaus and the Spartans, together with\r\nLechæum. This success alarmed Thebes, which unsuccessfully sued for peace.\r\nThe war continued, with the loss, to the Corinthians, of Piræum, an\r\nimportant island port, which induced the Thebans again to open\r\nnegotiations for peace, which were contemptuously rejected.\r\n\r\n(M616) In the midst of these successes, tidings came to Agesilaus of a\r\ndisaster which was attended with important consequences, and which spoiled\r\nhis triumph. This was the destruction of a detachment of six hundred\r\nLacedæmonian hoplites by the light troops of Iphicrates—an unprecedented\r\nvictory—for the hoplites, in their heavy defensive armor, held in contempt\r\nthe peltarts with their darts and arrows, even as the knights of mediæval\r\nEurope despised an encounter with the peasantry. This event revived the\r\ncourage of the anti-Spartan allies, and intensely humiliated the\r\nLacedæmonians. It was not only the loss of the aristocratic hoplites, but\r\nthe disgrace of being beaten by peltarts. Iphicrates recovered the places\r\nwhich Agesilaus had taken, and Corinth remained undisturbed.\r\n\r\n(M617) Sparta, in view of these great disasters, now sought to detach\r\nPersia from Athens. She sent Antalcidas to Ionia, offering to surrender\r\nthe Asiatic Greeks, and promising a universal autonomy throughout the\r\nGrecian world. These overtures were disliked by the allies, who sent Conon\r\nto counteract them. But Antalcidas gained the favor of the Persian satrap\r\nTiribasus, who had succeeded Tissaphernes, and he privately espoused the\r\ncause of Sparta, and seized Conon and caused his death. Tiribasus,\r\nhowever, was not sustained by the Persian court, which remained hostile to\r\nSparta. Struthas, a Persian general, was sent into Ionia, to act more\r\nvigorously against the Lacedæmonians. He gained a victory, B.C. 390, over\r\nthe Spartan forces, commanded by Thimbron, who was slain.\r\n\r\n(M618) The Lacedæmonians succeeded, after the death of Conon, in\r\nconcentrating a considerable fleet near Rhodes. Against this, Thrasybulus\r\nwas sent from Athens with a still larger one, and was gaining advantages,\r\nwhen he was slain near Aspendus, in Pamphylia, in a mutiny, and Athens\r\nlost the restorer of her renovated democracy, and an able general and\r\nhonest citizen, without the vindictive animosities which characterized the\r\ngreat men of his day.\r\n\r\n(M619) Rhodes still held out against the Lacedæmonians, who were now\r\ncommanded by Anaxibius, in the place of Dercyllidas. He was surprised by\r\nIphicrates, and was slain, and the Athenians, under this gallant leader,\r\nagain became masters of the Hellespont. But this success was balanced by\r\nthe defection of Ægina, which island was constrained by the Lacedæmonians\r\ninto war with Athens. I need not detail the various enterprises on both\r\nsides, until Antalcidas returned from Susa with the treaty confirmed\r\nbetween the Spartans and the court of Persia, which closed the war between\r\nthe various contending parties, B.C. 387. This treaty was of great\r\nimportance, but it indicates the loss of all Hellenic dignity when Sparta,\r\ntoo, descends so far as to comply with the demands of a Persian satrap.\r\nAthens and Sparta, both, at different times, invoked the aid of Persia\r\nagainst each other—the most mournful fact in the whole history of Greece,\r\nshowing how much more powerful were the rivalries of States than the\r\nsentiment of patriotism, which should have united them against their\r\ncommon enemy. The sacrifice of Ionia was the price which was paid by\r\nSparta, in order to retain her supremacy over the rest of Greece, and\r\nPersia ruled over all the Greeks on the Asiatic coast. Sparta became\r\nmistress of Corinth and of the Corinthian Isthmus. She organized\r\nanti-Theban oligarchies in the Bœotian cities, with a Spartan harmost. She\r\ndecomposed the Grecian world into small fragments. She crushed Olythus,\r\nand formed a confederacy between the Persian king and the Dionysius of\r\nSyracuse. In short, she ruled with despotic sway over all the different\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWe have now to show how Sparta lost the ascendency she had gained, and\r\nbecame involved in a war with Thebes, and how Thebes became, under\r\nPelopidas and Epaminondas, for a time the dominant State of Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPUBLIC OF THEBES.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M620) After Sparta and Athens, no State of Greece arrived at\r\npre-eminence, until the Macedonian empire arose, except Thebes, the\r\ncapital of Bœotia; and the empire of this city was short, though\r\nmemorable, from the extraordinary military genius of Epaminondas.\r\n\r\nIn the year B.C. 370, Sparta was the ascendant power of Greece, and was\r\nfeared, even as Athens was in the time of Pericles. She had formed an\r\nalliance with the Persian king and with Dionysius of Syracuse. All Greece,\r\nwithin and without the Peloponnesus, except Argos and Attica and some\r\nThessalian cities, was enrolled in a confederacy under the lead of Sparta,\r\nand Spartan governors and garrisons occupied the principal cities.\r\n\r\n(M621) Thebes especially was completely under Spartan influence and\r\ncontrol, and was apparently powerless. Her citadel, the Cadmea, was filled\r\nwith Spartan soldiers, and the independence of Greece was at an end.\r\nConfederated with Macedonians, Persians, and Syracusans, nobody dared to\r\ncall in question the headship of Sparta, or to provoke her displeasure.\r\n\r\n(M622) This destruction of Grecian liberties, with the aid of the old\r\nenemies of Greece, kindled great indignation. The orator Lysias, at\r\nAthens, gave vent to the general feeling, in which he veils his\r\ndispleasure under the form of surprise, that Sparta, as the chief of\r\nGreece, should permit the Persians, under Artaxerxes, and the Syracusans,\r\nunder Dionysius, to enslave Greece. The orator Isocrates spoke still more\r\nplainly, and denounced the Lacedæmonians as “traitors to the general\r\nsecurity and freedom of Greece, and seconding foreign kings to aggrandize\r\nthemselves at the cost of autonomous Grecian cities—all in the interest of\r\ntheir own selfish ambition.” Even Xenophon, with all his partiality for\r\nSparta, was still more emphatic, and accused the Lacedæmonians with the\r\nviolation of their oaths.\r\n\r\n(M623) In Thebes the discontent was most apparent, for their leading\r\ncitizens were exiled, and the oligarchal party, headed by Leontiades and\r\nthe Spartan garrison, was oppressive and tyrannical. The Theban exiles\r\nfound at Athens sympathy and shelter. Among these was Pelopidas, who\r\nresolved to free his country from the Spartan yoke. Holding intimate\r\ncorrespondence with his friends in Thebes, he looked forward patiently for\r\nthe means of effecting deliverance, which could only be effected by the\r\ndestruction of Leontiades and his colleagues, who ruled the city.\r\nPhilidas, secretary of the polemarchs, entered into the conspiracy, and,\r\nbeing sent in an embassy to Athens, concocted the way for Pelopidas and\r\nhis friends to return to Thebes and effect a revolution. Charon, an\r\neminent patriot, agreed to shelter the conspirators in his house until\r\nthey struck the blow. Epaminondas, then living at Thebes, dissuaded the\r\nenterprise as too hazardous, although all his sympathies were with the\r\nconspirators.\r\n\r\n(M624) When all was ready, Philidas gave a banquet at his house to the\r\npolemarchs, agreeing to introduce into the company some women of the first\r\nfamilies of Thebes, distinguished for their beauty. In concert with the\r\nTheban exiles at Athens, Pelopidas, with six companions, crossed Cithæron\r\nand arrived at Thebes, in December, B.C. 379, disguised as hunters, with\r\nno other arms than concealed daggers. By a fortunate accident they entered\r\nthe gates and sought shelter in the house of Charon until the night of the\r\nbanquet. They were introduced into the banqueting chamber when the\r\npolemarchs were full of wine, disguised in female attire, and, with the\r\naid of their Theban conspirators, dispatched three of the polemarchs with\r\ntheir daggers. Leontiades was not present, but the conspirators were\r\nconducted secretly to his house, and effected their purpose. Leontiades\r\nwas slain, in the presence of his wife. The conspirators then proceeded to\r\nthe prison, slew the jailer, and liberated the prisoners, and then\r\nproclaimed, by heralds, in the streets, at midnight, that the despots were\r\nslain and Thebes was free. But the Spartans still held possession of the\r\ncitadel, and, apprised of the _coup d’etat_, sent home for\r\nre-enforcements. But before they could arrive Pelopidas and the\r\nenfranchised citizens stormed the Cadmea, dispersed the garrison, put to\r\ndeath the oligarchal Thebans, and took full possession of the city.\r\n\r\n(M625) This unlooked-for revolution was felt throughout Greece like an\r\nelectric shook, and had a powerful moral effect. But the Spartans,\r\nalthough it was the depth of winter, sent forth an expedition, under King\r\nCleombrotus—Agesilaus being disabled—to reconquer Thebes. He conducted his\r\narmy along the Isthmus of Corinth, through Megara, but did nothing, and\r\nreturned, leaving his lieutenant, Sphodrias, to prosecute hostilities.\r\nSphodrias, learning that the Piræus was undefended, undertook to seize it,\r\nbut failed, which outrage so incensed the Athenians, that they dismissed\r\nthe Lacedæmonian envoys, and declared war against Sparta. Athens now\r\nexerted herself to form a second maritime confederacy, like that of Delos,\r\nand Thebes enrolled herself a member. As the Athenian envoys, sent to the\r\nislands of the Ægean, promised the most liberal principles, a new\r\nconfederacy was formed. The confederates assembled at Athens and\r\nthreatened war on an extensive scale. A resolution was passed to equip\r\ntwenty thousand hoplites, five hundred horsemen, and two hundred triremes.\r\nA new property-tax was imposed at Athens to carry on the war.\r\n\r\n(M626) At Thebes there was great enthusiasm, and Pelopidas, with Charon\r\nand Melon, were named the first bœotrarchs. The Theban government became\r\ndemocratic in form and spirit, and the military force was put upon a\r\nsevere training. A new brigade of three hundred hoplites, called the\r\nSacred Band, was organized for the special defense of the citadel,\r\ncomposed of young men from the best families, distinguished for strength\r\nand courage. The Thebans had always been good soldiers, but the popular\r\nenthusiasm raised up the best army for its size in Greece.\r\n\r\n(M627) Epaminondas now stands forth as a leader of rare excellence,\r\ndestined to achieve the greatest military reputation of any Greek, before\r\nor since his time, with the exception of Alexander the Great—a kind of\r\nGustavus Adolphus, introducing new tactics into Grecian warfare. He was in\r\nthe prime of life, belonging to a poor but honorable family, younger than\r\nPelopidas, who was rich. He had acquired great reputation for his\r\ngymnastic exercises; and was the most cultivated man in Thebes, a good\r\nmusician, and a still greater orator. He learned to play on both the lyre\r\nand flute from the teachings of the best masters, sought the conversation\r\nof the learned, but was especially eloquent in speech, and effective, even\r\nagainst the best Athenian opponents. He was modest, unambitious,\r\npatriotic, intellectual, contented with poverty, generous, and\r\ndisinterested. When the Cadmea was taken, he was undistinguished, and his\r\nrare merits were only known to Pelopidas and his friends. He was among the\r\nfirst to join the revolutionists, and was placed by Pelopidas among the\r\norganizers of the military force.\r\n\r\n(M628) The Spartans now made renewed exertions, and King Agesilaus, the\r\ngreatest military man of whom Sparta can boast, marched with a large army,\r\nin the spring of B.C. 378, to attack Thebes. He established his\r\nhead-quarters in Thespiæ, from which he issued to devastate the Theban\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThe Thebans and Athenians, unequal in force, still kept the field against\r\nhim, acting on the defensive, declining battle, and occupying strong\r\npositions. After a month of desultory warfare, Agesilaus retired, leaving\r\nPhœbidas in command at Thespiæ, who was slain in an incautious pursuit of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\n(M629) In the ensuing summer Agesilaus undertook a second expedition into\r\nBœotia, but gained no decided advantage, while the Thebans acquired\r\nexperience, courage, and strength. Agesilaus having strained his lame leg,\r\nwas incapacitated for active operation, and returned to Sparta, leaving\r\nCleombrotus to command the Spartan forces. He was unable to enter Bœotia,\r\nsince the passes over Mount Cithæron were held by the Thebans, and he made\r\nan inglorious retreat, without even reaching Bœotia.\r\n\r\n(M630) The Spartans now resolved to fit out a large naval force to operate\r\nagainst Athens, by whose assistance the Thebans had maintained their\r\nground for two years. The Athenians, on their part, also fitted out a\r\nfleet, assisted by their allies, under the command of Chabrias, which\r\ndefeated the Lacedæmonian fleet near Naxos, B.C. 376. This was the first\r\ngreat victory which Athens had gained since the Peloponnesian war, and\r\nfilled her citizens with joy and confidence, and led to a material\r\nenlargement of their maritime confederacy. Phocion, who had charge of a\r\nsquadron detached from the fleet of Chabrias, also sailed victorious round\r\nthe Ægean, took twenty triremes, three thousand prisoners, with one\r\nhundred and ten talents in money, and annexed seventeen cities to the\r\nconfederacy. Timotheus, the son of Conon, was sent with the fleet of\r\nChabrias, to circumnavigate the Peloponnesus, and alarm the coast of\r\nLaconia. The important island of Corcyra entered into the confederation,\r\nand another Spartan fleet, under Nicolochus, was defeated, so that the\r\nAthenians became once again the masters of the sea. But having regained\r\ntheir ascendency, Athens became jealous of the growing power of Thebes,\r\nnow mistress of Bœotia, and this jealousy, inexcusable after such\r\nreverses, was increased when Pelopidas gained a great victory over the\r\nLacedæmonians near Tegyra, which led to the expulsion of their enemies\r\nfrom all parts of Bœotia, except Orchomenus, on the borders of Phocis.\r\nThat territory was now attacked by the victorious Thebans, upon which\r\nAthens made peace with the Lacedæmonians.\r\n\r\n(M631) It would thus seem that the ancient Grecian States were perpetually\r\njealous of any ascendant power, and their policy was not dissimilar from\r\nthat which was inaugurated in modern Europe since the treaty of\r\nWestphalia—called the balance of power. Greece, thus far, was not\r\nambitious to extend her rule over foreign nations, but sought an\r\nautonomous independence of the several States of which she was composed.\r\nHad Greece united under the leadership of Sparta or Athens, her foreign\r\nconquests might have been considerable, and her power, centralized and\r\nformidable, might have been a match even for the Romans. But in the\r\nanxiety of each State to secure its independence, there were perpetual and\r\nunworthy jealousies of each rising State, when it had reached a certain\r\npoint of prosperity and glory. Hence the various States united under\r\nSparta, in the Peloponnesian war, to subvert the ascendency of Athens. And\r\nwhen Sparta became the dominant power of Greece, Athens unites with Thebes\r\nto break her domination. And now Athens becomes jealous of Thebes, and\r\nmakes peace with Sparta, in the same way that England in the eighteenth\r\ncentury united with Holland and other States, to prevent the\r\naggrandizement of France, as different powers of Europe had previously\r\nunited to prevent the ascendency of Austria.\r\n\r\n(M632) The Spartan power was now obviously humbled, and one of the\r\ngreatest evidences of this was the decline of Sparta to give aid to the\r\ncities of Thessaly, in danger of being conquered by Jason, the despot of\r\nPheræ, whose formidable strength was now alarming Northern Greece.\r\n\r\n(M633) The peace which Sparta had concluded with Athens was of very short\r\nduration. The Lacedæmonians resolved to attack Corcyra, which had joined\r\nthe Athenian confederation. An armament collected from the allies, under\r\nMnasippus, in the spring of B.C. 373, proceeded against Corcyra. The\r\ninhabitants, driven within the walls of the city, were in danger of\r\nfamine, and invoked Athenian aid. Before it arrived, however, the\r\nCorcyræans made a successful sally upon the Spartan troops, over-confident\r\nof victory, in which Mnasippus was slain, and the city became supplied\r\nwith provisions. After the victory, Iphicrates, in command of the Athenian\r\nfleet, which had been delayed, arrived and captured the ships which\r\nDionysius of Syracuse had sent to the aid of the Lacedæmonians. These\r\nreverses induced the Spartans to send Antalcidas again to Persia to sue\r\nfor fresh intervention, but the satraps, having nothing more to gain from\r\nSparta, refused aid. But Athens was not averse to peace, since she no\r\nlonger was jealous of Sparta, and was jealous of Thebes. In the mean time\r\nThebes seized Platæa, a town of Bœotia, unfriendly to her ascendency, and\r\nexpelled the inhabitants who sought shelter in Athens, and increased the\r\nfeeling of disaffection toward the rising power. This event led to renewed\r\nnegotiations for peace between Athens and Sparta, which was effected at a\r\ncongress held in the latter city. The Athenian orator Callistratus, one of\r\nthe envoys, proposed that Sparta and Athens should divide the headship of\r\nGreece between them, the former having the supremacy on land, the latter\r\non the sea. Peace was concluded on the basis of the autonomy of each city.\r\n\r\n(M634) Epaminondas was the Theban deputy to this congress. He insisted on\r\ntaking the oath in behalf of the Bœotian confederation, even as Sparta had\r\ndone for herself and allies. But Agesilaus required he should take the\r\noath for Thebes alone, as Athens had done for herself alone. He refused,\r\nand made himself memorable for his eloquent speeches, in which he\r\nprotested against the pretensions of Sparta. “Why,” he maintained, “should\r\nnot Thebes respond for Bœotia, as well as Sparta for Laconia, since Thebes\r\nhad the same ascendency in Bœotia that Sparta had in Laconia?” Agesilaus,\r\nat last, indignantly started from his seat, and said to Epaminondas:\r\n“Speak plainly. Will you, or will you not, leave to each of the Bœotian\r\ncities its separate autonomy?” To which the other replied: “Will you leave\r\neach of the Laconian towns autonomous?” Without saying a word, Agesilaus\r\nstruck the name of the Thebans out of the roll, and they were excluded\r\nfrom the treaty.\r\n\r\n(M635) The war now is to be prosecuted between Sparta and Thebes, since\r\npeace was sworn between all the other States. The deputies of Thebes\r\nreturned home discouraged, knowing that their city must now encounter,\r\nsingle-handed, the whole power of the dominant State of Greece. “The\r\nAthenians—friendly with both, yet allies with neither—suffered the dispute\r\nto be fought out without interfering.” The point of it was, whether Thebes\r\nwas in the same relation to the Bœotian towns that Sparta was to the\r\nLaconian cities. Agesilaus contended that the relations between Thebes and\r\nother Bœotian cities was the same as what subsisted between Sparta and her\r\nallies. This was opposed by Epaminondas.\r\n\r\n(M636) After the congress of B.C. 371, both Sparta and Athens fulfilled\r\nthe conditions to which their deputies had sworn. The latter gave orders\r\nto Iphicrates to return home with his fleet, which had threatened the\r\nLacedæmonian coast; the former recalled her harmosts and garrisons from\r\nall the cities which she occupied, while she made preparations, with all\r\nher energies, to subdue Thebes. It was anticipated that so powerful a\r\nState as Sparta would soon accomplish her object, and few out of Bœotia\r\ndoubted her success.\r\n\r\n(M637) King Cleombrotus was accordingly ordered to march out of Phocis,\r\nwhere he was with a powerful force, into Bœotia. Epaminondas, with a body\r\nof Thebans, occupied a narrow pass near Coronea, between a spur of Mount\r\nHelicon and the Lake Copais. But instead of forcing this pass, the Spartan\r\nking turned southward by a mountain road, over Helicon, deemed scarcely\r\npracticable, and defeated a Theban division which guarded it, and marched\r\nto Creusis, on the Gulf of Alcyonis, and captured twelve Theban triremes\r\nin the harbor. He then left a garrison to occupy the post, and proceeded\r\nover a mountainous road in the territory of Thespiæ, on the eastern\r\ndeclivity of Helicon, to Leuctra, where he encamped. He was now near\r\nThebes, having a communication with Sparta through the port of Creusis.\r\nThe Thebans were dismayed, and it required all the tact and eloquence of\r\nEpaminondas and Pelopidas to rally them. They marched out at length from\r\nThebes, under their seven bœotrarchs, and posted themselves opposite the\r\nSpartan camp. Epaminondas was one of these generals, and urged immediate\r\nbattle, although the Theban forces were inferior.\r\n\r\n(M638) It was through him that a change took place in the ordinary Grecian\r\ntactics. It was customary to fight simultaneously along the whole line, in\r\nwhich the opposing armies were drawn up. Departing from this custom, he\r\ndisposed his troops obliquely, or in échelon, placing on his left chosen\r\nTheban hoplites to the depth of fifty, so as to bear with impetuous force\r\non the Spartan right, while his centre and right were kept back for awhile\r\nfrom action. Such a combination, so unexpected, was completely successful.\r\nThe Spartans could not resist the concentrated and impetuous assault made\r\non their right, led by the Sacred Band, with fifty shields propelling\r\nbehind. Cleombrotus, the Spartan king, was killed, with the most\r\ndistinguished of his staff, and the Spartans were driven back to their\r\ncamp. The allies, who fought without spirit or heart, could not be\r\nrallied. The victory was decisive, and made an immense impression\r\nthroughout Greece; for it was only twenty days since Epaminondas had\r\ndeparted from Sparta, excluded from the general peace. The Spartans bore\r\nthe defeat with their characteristic fortitude, but their prestige was\r\ndestroyed. A new general had arisen in Bœotia, who carried every thing\r\nbefore him. The Athenians heard of the victory with ill-concealed jealousy\r\nof the rising power.\r\n\r\n(M639) Jason, the tyrant of Pheræ, now joined the Theban camp and the\r\nSpartan army was obliged to evacuate Bœotia. The great victory of Leuctra\r\ngave immense extension to the Theban power, and broke the Spartan rule\r\nnorth of the Peloponnesus. All the cities of Bœotia acknowledged the\r\nTheban supremacy, while the harmosts which Sparta had placed in the\r\nGrecian cities were forced to return home. Sparta was now discouraged and\r\nhelpless, and even many Peloponnesian cities put themselves under the\r\npresidency of Athens. None were more affected by the Spartan overthrow\r\nthan the Arcadians, whose principal cities had been governed by an\r\noligarchy in the interest of Sparta, such as Tegea and Orchomenus, while\r\nMantinea was broken up into villages. The Arcadians, free from Spartan\r\ngovernors, and ceasing to look henceforth for victory and plunder in the\r\nservice of Sparta, became hostile, and sought their political\r\nindependence. A Pan-Arcadian union was formed.\r\n\r\n(M640) Sparta undertook to recover her supremacy over Arcadia, and\r\nAgesilaus was sent to Mantinea with a considerable force, for the city had\r\nrebuilt its walls, and resumed its former consolidation, which was a great\r\noffense in the eyes of Sparta. The Arcadians, invaded by Spartans, first\r\ninvoked the aid of Athens, which being refused, they turned to Thebes, and\r\nEpaminondas came to their relief with a great army of\r\nauxiliaries—Argeians, Elians, Phocians, Locrians, as well as Thebans, for\r\nhis fame now drew adventurers from every quarter to his standard. These\r\nforces urged him to invade Laconia itself, and his great army, in four\r\ndivisions, penetrated the country through different passes. He crossed the\r\nEurotas and advanced to Sparta, which was in the greatest consternation,\r\nnot merely from the near presence of Epaminondas with a powerful army of\r\nseventy thousand men, but from the discontent of the Helots. But Agesilaus\r\nput the city in the best possible defense, while every means were used to\r\nsecure auxiliaries from other cities. Epaminondas dared not to attempt to\r\ntake the city by storm, and after ravaging Laconia, returned into Arcadia.\r\nThis insult to Sparta was of great moral force, and was an intense\r\nhumiliation, greater even than that felt after the battle of Leuctra.\r\n\r\n(M641) This expedition, though powerless against Sparta herself, prepared\r\nEpaminondas to execute the real object which led to the assistance of the\r\nArcadians. This was the re-establishment of Messenia, which had been\r\nconquered by Sparta two hundred years before. The new city of Messenia was\r\nbuilt on the site of Mount Ithome, where the Messenians had defended\r\nthemselves in their long war against the Laconians, and the best masons\r\nand architects were invited from all Greece to lay out the streets, and\r\nerect the public edifices, while Epaminondas superintended the\r\nfortifications. All the territory westward and south of Ithome—the\r\nsouthwestern corner of the Peloponnesus, richest on the peninsula, was now\r\nsubtracted from Sparta, while the country to the east was protected by the\r\nnew city in Arcadia, Megalopolis, which the Arcadians built. This wide\r\narea, the best half of the Spartan territory, was thus severed from\r\nSparta, and was settled by Helots, who became free men, with\r\ninextinguishable hatred of their old masters. But these Helots were\r\nprobably the descendants of the old Messenians whom Sparta had conquered.\r\nThis renovation of Messenia, and the building of the two cities, Messenia\r\nand Megalopolis, was the work of Epaminondas, and were the most important\r\nevents of the day. The latter city was designed as the centre of a new\r\nconfederacy, comprising all Arcadia.\r\n\r\n(M642) Sparta being thus crippled, dismembered, and humbled, Epaminondas\r\nevacuated the Peloponnesus, filled, however, with undiminished hostility.\r\nSparta condescends to solicit aid from Athens, so completely was its power\r\nbroken by the Theban State, and Athens consents to assist her, in the\r\ngrowing fear and jealousy of Thebes, thereby showing that the animosities\r\nof the Grecian States grew out of political jealousy rather than from\r\nrevenge or injury. To rescue Sparta was a wise policy, if it were\r\nnecessary to maintain a counterpoise against the ascendency of Thebes. An\r\narmy was raised, and Iphicrates was appointed general. He first marched to\r\nCorinth, and from thence into Arcadia, but made war with no important\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n(M643) Such were the great political changes which occurred within two\r\nyears under the influence of such a hero as Epaminondas. Laconia had been\r\ninvaded and devastated, the Spartans were confined within their walls,\r\nMessenia had been liberated from Spartan rule, two important cities had\r\nbeen built, to serve as great fortresses to depress Sparta, Helots were\r\nconverted into freemen, and Greece generally had been emancipated from the\r\nSpartan yoke. Such were the consequences of the battle of Leuctra.\r\n\r\nAnd this battle, which thus destroyed the prestige of Sparta, also led to\r\nrenewed hopes on the part of the Athenians to regain the power they had\r\nlost. Athens already had regained the ascendency on the sea, and looked\r\nfor increased maritime aggrandizement. On the land she could only remain a\r\nsecond class power, and serve as a bulwark against Theban ascendency.\r\n\r\n(M644) Athens sought also to recover Amphipolis—a maritime city, colonized\r\nby Athenians, at the head of the Strymonican Gulf, in Macedonia, which was\r\ntaken from her in the Peloponnesian war, by Brasidas. Amyntas, the king of\r\nMacedonia, seeking aid against Jason of Pheræ, whose Thessalian dominion\r\nand personal talents and ambition combined to make him a powerful\r\npotentate, consented to the right of Athens to this city. But Amyntas died\r\nnot long after the assassination of Jason, and both Thessaly and Macedonia\r\nwere ruled by new kings, and new complications took place. Many Thessalian\r\ncities, hostile to Alexander, the son of Jason, invoked the aid of Thebes,\r\nand Pelopidas was sent into Thessaly with an army, who took Larissa and\r\nvarious other cities under his protection. A large part of Thessaly thus\r\ncame under the protection of Thebes. On the other hand, Alexander, who\r\nsucceeded Amyntas in Macedonia, found it difficult to maintain his own\r\ndominion without holding Thessalian towns in garrison. He was also\r\nharassed by interior commotions, headed by Pausanias, and was slain.\r\nPtolemy, of Alorus, now became regent, and administered the kingdom in the\r\nname of the minor children of Amyntas—Perdiccas and Philip. The mother of\r\nthese children, Eurydice, presented herself, with her children, to\r\nIphicrates, and invoked protection. He declared in her favor, and expelled\r\nPausanias, and secured the sceptre of Amyntas, who had been friendly to\r\nthe Athenians, to his children, under Ptolemy as regent. The younger of\r\nthese children lived to overthrow the liberties of Greece.\r\n\r\n(M645) But Iphicrates did not recover Amphipolis, which was a free city,\r\nand had become attached to the Spartans after Brasidas had taken it.\r\nIphicrates was afterward sent to assist Sparta in the desperate contest\r\nwith Thebes. The Spartan allied army occupied Corinth, and guarded the\r\npasses which prevented the Thebans from penetrating into the Peloponnesus.\r\nEpaminondas broke through the defenses of the Spartans, and opened a\r\ncommunication with his Peloponnesian allies, and with these increased\r\nforces was more than a match for the Spartans and Athenians. He ravaged\r\nthe country, induced Sicyon to abandon Sparta, and visited Arcadia to\r\nsuperintend the building of Megalopolis. Meanwhile Pelopidas, B.C. 368,\r\nconducted an expedition into Thessaly, to protect Larissa against\r\nAlexander of Pheræ, and to counterwork the projects of that despot, who\r\nwas in league with Athens. He was successful, and then proceeded to\r\nMacedonia, and made peace with Ptolemy, who was not strong enough to\r\nresist him, taking, among other hostages to Thebes, Philip, the son of\r\nAmyntas. The Thebans and Macedonians now united to protect the freedom of\r\nAmphipolis against Athens. Pelopidas returned to Thebes, having extended\r\nher ascendency over both Thessaly and Macedonia.\r\n\r\n(M646) Thebes, now ambitious for the headship of Greece, sent Pelopidas on\r\na mission to the Persian king at Susa, who obtained a favorable rescript.\r\nThe States which were summoned to Thebes to hear the rescript read refused\r\nto accept it; and even the Arcadian deputies protested against the\r\nheadship of Thebes. So powerful were the sentiments of all the Grecian\r\nStates, from first to last, against the complete ascendency of any one\r\npower, either Athens, or Sparta, or Thebes. The rescript was also rejected\r\nat Corinth. Pelopidas was now sent to Thessaly to secure the recognition\r\nof the headship of Thebes; but in the execution of his mission he was\r\nseized and detained by Alexander of Pheræ.\r\n\r\nThe Thebans then sent an army into Thessaly to rescue Pelopidas.\r\nUnfortunately, Epaminondas did not command it. Having given offense to his\r\ncountrymen, he was not elected that year as bœotrarch, and served in the\r\nranks as a private hoplite. Alexander, assisted by the Athenians,\r\ntriumphed in his act of treachery, and treated his illustrious captive\r\nwith harshness and cruelty, and the Theban army, unsuccessful, returned\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n(M647) The Thebans then sent another army, under Epaminondas, into\r\nThessaly for the rescue of Pelopidas, and such was the terror of his name,\r\nthat Alexander surrendered his prisoner, and sought to make peace. But the\r\nrescue of Pelopidas disabled Thebes from prosecuting the war in the\r\nPeloponnesus. As soon, however, as this was effected, Epaminondas was sent\r\nas an envoy into Arcadia to dissuade her from a proposed alliance with\r\nAthens, and there had to contend with the Athenian orator Callistratus.\r\nThe complicated relations of the different Grecian States now became so\r\ncomplicated, that it is useless, in a book like this, to attempt to\r\nunravel them. Negotiations between Athens and Persia, the efforts of\r\nCorinth and other cities to secure peace, the ambition of Athens to\r\nmaintain ascendency on the sea, the creation of a Theban navy—these and\r\nother events must be passed by.\r\n\r\nBut we can not omit to notice the death of Pelopidas.\r\n\r\n(M648) He had been sent with an army into Thessaly against Alexander of\r\nPheræ, who was at the height of his power, holding in dependence a\r\nconsiderable part of Thessaly, and having Athens for an ally. In a battle\r\nwhich took place between Pelopidas and Alexander, near Pharsalus, the\r\nThessalians were routed. Pelopidas, seeing his enemy apparently within his\r\nreach, and remembering only his injuries, sallied forth, unsupported, like\r\nCyrus, on the field of Cunaxa, at the sight of his brother, to attack him\r\nwhen surrounded by his guards, and fell while fighting bravely. Nothing\r\ncould exceed the grief of the victorious Thebans in view of this disaster,\r\nwhich was the result of inexcusable rashness. He was endeared by\r\nuninterrupted services from the day he slew the Spartan governors and\r\nrecovered the independence of his city. He had taken a prominent part in\r\nall the struggles which had raised Thebes to unexpected glory, and was\r\nsecond in abilities to Epaminondas alone, whom he ever cherished with more\r\nthan fraternal friendship, without envy and without reproach. All that\r\nThebes could do was to revenge his death. Alexander was stripped of all\r\nhis Thessalian dependencies, and confined to his own city, with its\r\nterritory, near the Gulf of Pegasæ.\r\n\r\n(M649) It was while Pelopidas was engaged in his Thessalian campaign, that\r\na conspiracy against the power of Thebes took place in the second city of\r\nBœotia—Orchomenus, on Lake Copais. This city was always disaffected, and\r\nin the absence of Pelopidas in Thessaly, and Epaminondas with a fleet on\r\nthe Hellespont, some three hundred of the richest citizens undertook to\r\noverthrow the existing government. The plot was discovered before it was\r\nripe for execution, the conspirators were executed, the town itself was\r\ndestroyed, the male adults were killed, and the women and children were\r\nsold into slavery. This barbarous act was but the result of long pent up\r\nTheban hatred, but it kindled a great excitement against Thebes throughout\r\nGreece. The city, indeed, sympathized with the Spartan cause, and would\r\nhave been destroyed before but for the intercession of Epaminondas, whose\r\npolicy was ever lenient and magnanimous. It was a matter of profound grief\r\nto this general, now re-elected as one of the bœotarchs, that Thebes had\r\nstained her name by this cruel vengeance, since he knew it would intensify\r\nthe increasing animosity against the power which had arrived so suddenly\r\nto greatness.\r\n\r\n(M650) Hostilities, as he feared, soon broke out with increased bitterness\r\nbetween Sparta and Thebes. And these were precipitated by difficulties in\r\nArcadia, then at war with Elis, and the appropriation of the treasures of\r\nOlympia by the Arcadians. Sparta, Elis, and Achaia formed an alliance, and\r\nArcadia invoked the aid of Thebes. The result was that Epaminondas marched\r\nwith a large army into the Peloponnesus, and mustered his forces at Tegea,\r\nwhich was under the protection of Thebes. His army comprised, besides\r\nThebans and Bœotians, Eubœans, Thessalians, Locrians, and other allies\r\nfrom Northern Greece. The Spartans, allied with Elians, Achæans, and\r\nAthenians, united at Mantinea, under the command of Agesilaus, now an old\r\nman of eighty, but still vigorous and strong. Tegea lay in the direct road\r\nfrom Sparta to Mantinea, and while Agesilaus was moving by a more\r\ncircuitous route to the westward, Epaminondas resolved to attempt a\r\nsurprise on Sparta. This movement was unexpected, and nothing saved Sparta\r\nexcept the accidental information which Agesilaus received of the movement\r\nfrom a runner, in time to turn back to Sparta and put it in a condition of\r\ndefense before Epaminondas arrived, for Tegea was only about thirty miles\r\nfrom Sparta. The Theban general was in no condition to assault the city,\r\nand his enterprise failed, from no fault of his. Seeing that Sparta was\r\ndefended, he marched back immediately to Tegea, and dispatched his cavalry\r\nto surprise Mantinea, about fifteen miles distant. The surprise was\r\nbaffled by the unexpected arrival of Athenian cavalry. An encounter took\r\nplace between these two bodies of cavalry, in which the Athenians gained\r\nan advantage. Epaminondas saw then no chance left for striking a blow but\r\nby a pitched battle, with all his forces. He therefore marched from Tegea\r\ntoward the enemy, who did not expect to be attacked, and was unprepared.\r\nHe adopted the same tactics that gave him success at Leuctra, and posted\r\nhimself, with his Theban phalanx on the left, against the opposing right,\r\nand bore down with irresistible force, both of infantry and cavalry, while\r\nhe kept back the centre and right, composed of his trustworthy troops,\r\nuntil the battle should be decided. His column, not far from fifty shields\r\nin depth, pressed upon the opposing column of only eight shields in depth,\r\nlike the prow of a trireme impelled against the midships of an antagonist\r\nin a sea-fight. This mode of attack was completely successful. Epaminondas\r\nbroke through the Lacedæmonian line, which turned and fled, but he\r\nhimself, pressing on to the attack, at the head of his column, was\r\nmortally wounded. He was pierced with a spear—the handle broke, leaving\r\nthe head sticking in his breast. He at once fell, and his own troops\r\ngathered around his bleeding body, giving full expression to their grief\r\nand lamentations.\r\n\r\n(M651) Thebes gained, by the battle of Mantinea, the preservation of her\r\nArcadian allies and of her anti-Spartan frontier; while Sparta lost,\r\nbeyond hope, her ancient prestige and power. But the victory was dearly\r\npurchased by the death of Epaminondas, who has received, and probably\r\ndeserves, more unmingled admiration than any hero whom Greece ever\r\nproduced. He was a great military genius, and introduced new tactics into\r\nthe art of war. He was a true patriot, thinking more of the glory of his\r\ncountry than his own exaltation. He was a man of great political insight,\r\nand merits the praise of being a great statesman. He was, above all,\r\nunsullied by vices, generous, devoted, merciful in war, magnanimous in\r\nvictory, and laborious in peace. He was also learned, eloquent, and wise,\r\nruling by moral wisdom as well as by genius. His death was an irreparable\r\nloss—one of those great men whom his country could not spare, and whose\r\nservices no other man could render. Of modern heroes he most resembles\r\nGustavus Adolphus. And as the Thirty Years in Germany loses all its\r\ninterest after the battle of Leutzen, when the Swedish hero laid down his\r\nlife in defense of his Protestant brethren, so the Theban contest with\r\nSparta has no great significance after the battle of Mantinea. The only\r\ngreat blunder which Epaminondas made was to encourage his countrymen to\r\ncompete with Athens for the sovereignty of the seas. That sovereignty was\r\nthe natural empire of Athens, even as the empire of the land was the glory\r\nof Sparta. If these two powers had been contented with their own peculiar\r\nsphere, and joined in a true alliance with each other, the empire of\r\nGreece might have resisted the encroachments of Philip and Alexander, and\r\ndefied the growing ascendency of Rome.\r\n\r\n(M652) Shortly after the death of Epaminondas, B.C. 362, the greatest man\r\nof Spartan annals disappeared from the stage of history. Agesilaus died in\r\nEgypt, having gone there to assist the king in his revolt from Persia. He\r\nalso possessed all the great qualities of a prince, a soldier, a statesman\r\nand a man. He, too, was ambitious, but only to perpetuate the power of\r\nSparta. It was his misfortune to contend with a greater man, but he did\r\nall that was in the power of a king of Sparta to retrieve her fortunes,\r\nand died deeply lamented and honored. Artaxerxes died B.C. 358, after\r\nhaving subdued the revolt of his satraps and of Egypt, having reigned\r\nforty-five years, and Ochus succeeded to his throne, taking his father’s\r\nname.\r\n\r\n(M653) Athens recovered, during the wars between Sparta and Thebes, much\r\nof her former maritime power, and succeeded in retaking the Chersonese.\r\nBut another great character now arises to our view—Philip of Macedon, who\r\nsucceeded in overturning the liberties of Greece. But before we present\r\nhis career, that of Dionysius of Syracuse, demands a brief notice, and the\r\ngreat power of Sicily, as a Grecian State, during his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIONYSIUS AND SICILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how the Athenian fleet was destroyed at the siege of\r\nSyracuse, where Nicias and Demosthenes were so lamentably defeated, which\r\ndefeat resulted in the humiliation of Athens and the loss of her power as\r\nthe leading State of Greece.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of this great Athenian armament in September, B.C. 413,\r\ncreated an intoxication of triumph in the Sicilian cities. Nearly all of\r\nthem had joined Syracuse, except Naxos and Catana, which sided with\r\nAthens. Agrigentum was neutral.\r\n\r\n(M654) The Syracusans were too much exhausted by the contest to push their\r\nvictory to the loss of the independence of these cities, but they assisted\r\ntheir allies, the Lacedæmonians, with twenty triremes against Athens,\r\nunder Hermocrates, while Rhodes furnished a still further re-enforcement,\r\nunder Dorieus. But the Peloponnesian war was not finished as soon as the\r\nSyracusans anticipated. Even the combined Peloponnesian and Syracusan\r\nfleets sustained two defeats in the Hellespont. The battle of Cyxicus was\r\neven still more calamitous, since the Spartan admiral Mindarus was slain,\r\nand the whole of his fleet was captured and destroyed. The Syracusans\r\nsuffered much by this latter defeat, and all their triremes were burned to\r\nprevent them falling into the hands of their enemies, and the seamen were\r\nleft destitute on the Propontis, in the satrapy of Pharnabazus. These\r\nadverse events led to the disgrace of Hermocrates, who stimulated the\r\nmovement and promised what he could not perform. But his conduct had been\r\ngood, and his treatment was unjust and harsh. War recognizes only success,\r\nwhatever may be the virtues and talents of the commanders; and this is one\r\nof the worst phases of war, when accident and circumstances contribute\r\nmore to military rewards than genius itself.\r\n\r\n(M655) The banishment of Hermocrates was followed by the triumph of the\r\ndemocratical party, and Diocles, an influential citizen, was named, with a\r\ncommission of ten, to revise the constitution and the laws. The laws of\r\nDiocles did not remain in force long, and were exceeding severe in their\r\npenalties. But they were afterward revived, and copied by other Sicilian\r\ncities, and remained in force to the Grecian conquest of the island.\r\n\r\n(M656) The Syracusans then prosecuted war with vigor against Naxos, which\r\nsided with Athens, until it was brought to a sudden close by an invasion\r\nof the Carthaginians, the ancient foes of Greece. As far back as the year\r\n480 B.C.—that year which witnessed the invasion of Greece by Xerxes—the\r\nCarthaginians had invaded Sicily, with a mercenary army under Hamilcar,\r\nfor the purpose of reinstating the tyrant of Himera, expelled by Theron of\r\nAgrigentum. The Carthaginian army was routed, and Hamilcar was slain by\r\nGelon, the tyrant of Syracuse. This defeat was so signal, that it was\r\nseventy years before the Carthaginians again invaded Sicily, shortly after\r\nthe destruction of Athenian power at Syracuse. No sooner was the\r\nprotecting naval power of Athens withdrawn from Greece, than the Persians\r\nand the Carthaginians pressed upon the Hellenic world.\r\n\r\n(M657) It is singular that so little is known of the early history of\r\nCarthage, which became the great rival of Rome. It was founded by the\r\nPhœnicians, and became a considerable commercial city before Athens had\r\nreached the naval supremacy of Greece. Her possessions were extensive on\r\nthe coast of Africa, both east and west, comprehending Sardinia and the\r\nBalearic isles. At the maximum of her power, before the first Punic war,\r\nthe population was nearly a million of people. It was built on a fortified\r\npeninsula of about twenty miles in circumference, with the isthmus. Upon\r\nthis isthmus was the citadel Byrsa, surrounded with a triple wall, and\r\ncrowned at its summit by a magnificent temple of Æsculapius. It possessed\r\nthree hundred tributary cities in Libya, which was but a small part of the\r\ngreat empire which belonged to it in the fourth century before Christ. All\r\nthe towns on the coast, even those founded by the Phœnicians, like Hippo\r\nand Utica, were tributary, with the exception of Utica. Although the\r\nCarthaginians were averse to land service, yet no less than forty thousand\r\nhoplites, with one thousand cavalry and two thousand war chariots, marched\r\nout from the gates to resist an enemy. But the Carthaginian armies were\r\nmostly composed of mercenaries—Gauls, Iberians, and Libyans, and forming a\r\ndiscordant host in language and custom.\r\n\r\n(M658) The political constitution of Carthage was oligarchal. Two kings\r\nwere elected annually, and presided over the Senate, of three hundred\r\npersons, made up from the principal families. The great families divided\r\nbetween them, as in Rome, the offices and influence of the State, and\r\nmaintained an insolent distinction from the people. It was an aristocracy,\r\nbased on wealth, and created by commerce, as in Venice, in the Middle\r\nAges. There was a demos, or people, at Carthage, who were consulted on\r\nparticular occasions; but, whether numerous or not, they were kept in\r\ndependence to the rich families by banquets and lucrative employments. The\r\ngovernment was stable and well conducted, both for internal tranquillity\r\nand commercial aggrandizement.\r\n\r\n(M659) The first eminent historical personage was Mago, B.C. 500, who\r\ngreatly extended the dominions of Carthage. Of his two sons, Hamilcar was\r\ndefeated and slain by Gelon of Syracuse. The other son, Hasdrubal,\r\nperished in Sardinia. His sons remained the most powerful citizens of the\r\nState, carrying on war against the Moors and other African tribes.\r\nHannibal, grandson of Hamilcar, distinguished himself in an invasion of\r\nSicily, B.C. 410, and with a large army, of one hundred thousand men,\r\nstormed and took Selinus, and killed one hundred and sixty thousand of the\r\ninhabitants, and carried away captive five thousand more. He then laid\r\nsiege to Himera, which he also took, and slaughtered three thousand of the\r\ninhabitants, in expiation of the memory of his grandfather. These were\r\nGrecian cities, and the alarm throughout Greece was profound for this new\r\nenemy. These events look place about the time that Hermocrates was\r\nbanished for an unsuccessful maritime war. Hermocrates afterward attempted\r\nto enter Syracuse, but was defeated and slain.\r\n\r\n(M660) At this period Dionysius appears upon the stage—for the next\r\ngeneration the most formidable name in the Grecian world. He had none of\r\nthe advantages of family or wealth—but was well educated, and espoused the\r\ncause of Hermocrates, and rose to distinction during the intestine\r\ncommotions which resulted from the death of Hermocrates and the banishment\r\nof Diocles, the lawgiver.\r\n\r\n(M661) In 406 B.C., Sicily was again invaded by a large force from\r\nCarthage, estimated by some writers as high as three hundred thousand men,\r\nwho were chiefly mercenaries. Hannibal was the leader of these forces. All\r\nthe Greek cities now prepared for vigorous war. The Syracusans sent to\r\nSparta and the Italian Greek cities for aid. Agrigentum was most in\r\ndanger, and most alarmed of the Greek Sicilian cities. It was second only\r\nto Syracuse in numbers and wealth, having a population of eight hundred\r\nthousand people, though this is probably an exaggeration. It was rich in\r\ntemples and villas and palaces; its citizens were wealthy, luxurious, and\r\nhospitable.\r\n\r\n(M662) The army of Hannibal advanced against this city, which was strongly\r\nfortified, and re-enforced by a strong body of troops from Syracuse, under\r\nDaphneus. He defeated the Iberian mercenaries, but did not preserve his\r\nvictory, so that the Carthaginians were enabled to take and plunder\r\nAgrigentum. There was, of course, bitter complaint against the Syracusan\r\ngenerals, who might have prevented this calamity. In the discontent which\r\nsucceeded, Dionysius was elevated to the command. He procured a vote to\r\nrestore the Hermocratean exiles, and procured, also, a body of paid\r\nguards, and established himself as despot of Syracuse; and he arrived at\r\nthis power by demagogic arts, allying himself with the ultra democratic\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n(M663) Soon after his elevation, the Carthaginians advanced, under Imoleo,\r\nto attack Gela, which was relieved by Dionysius with a force of fifty\r\nthousand men. Intrenching himself between Gela and the sea, opposite the\r\nCarthaginians, he resolved to attack the invaders, but was defeated and\r\nobliged to retreat, so that Gela fell into the hands of the Carthaginians,\r\nwho perpetrated their usual cruelties. This defeat occasioned a mutiny at\r\nSyracuse, and his house was plundered of the silver and gold and valuables\r\nwhich he had already collected. But he rapidly returned to Syracuse, and\r\npunished the mutineers, and became master of the city, driving away the\r\nrich citizens who had vainly obstructed his elevation. He abolished every\r\nremnant of freedom, and ruled despotically with the aid of his\r\nmercenaries, and the common people who rallied to his standard.\r\n\r\n(M664) It was fortunate for him that the Carthaginians, although victors\r\nat Gela, made proposals of peace, which were accepted. Dionysius accepted\r\na peace, the terms of which were favorable to Carthage, in order to secure\r\nhis own power. He betrayed the interests of Sicily to an enemy from\r\nselfish and unworthy motives. The whole south of Sicily was consigned to\r\nthe Carthaginians, and Syracuse to Dionysius.\r\n\r\n(M665) Dionysius now concentrated all his efforts to centralize and\r\nmaintain his power. He greatly strengthened the fortifications of\r\nSyracuse. He constructed a new wall, with lofty towers and elaborate\r\ndefenses, outside the mole which connected the islet Ortygia with Sicily.\r\nHe also erected a citadel. He then had an impregnable stronghold, powerful\r\nfor attack and defense. The fortress he erected in the islet of Ortygia he\r\nfilled with his devoted adherents, consisting mostly of foreigners, to\r\nwhom he assigned a permanent support and residence. He distributed anew\r\nthe Syracusan territory, reserving the best lands for his friends, who\r\nthus became citizens. By this wholesale confiscation he was enabled to\r\nsupport ten thousand mercenary troops, devoted to him and his tyranny. The\r\ncontributions he extorted were enormous, so that in five years twenty per\r\ncent of the whole property of Syracuse was paid into his hands.\r\n\r\n(M666) Having thus strengthened his power in Syracuse, he marched against\r\nthe Sikels, in the interior of the island. But his absence was taken\r\nadvantage of by the discontented citizens, who attempted to regain their\r\nfreedom. He returned at once to Syracuse, and intrenched himself in his\r\nfortress, where he was besieged by the insurgents. The tyrant was now\r\ndriven to desperation, and nothing saved him but the impregnable\r\nfortifications which he had erected. But his situation was so desperate\r\nthat his adherents melted away, and he began to abandon all hope of\r\nretaining his position. As a last resource, he purchased the aid of a body\r\nof Campanian cavalry, in the Carthaginian service, which was stationed at\r\nGela, while he amused the Syracusans, to gain time, by a pretended\r\nsubmission. They agreed to allow him to depart with five triremes, and\r\nrelaxed the siege, supposing him already subdued. Meanwhile the\r\nCarthaginian mercenaries arrived and defeated the Syracusans, already\r\ndispersed and divided. Dionysius, finding himself rescued and\r\nre-established in his dominions, strengthened the fortifications of\r\nOrtygia, and employed his forces, now that Syracuse was subdued, in\r\nconquering the Grecian cities of Naxos, Catana, and Leontini. Strengthened\r\nat home and in the interior, Dionysius then prepared to attack the\r\nCarthaginians, but previously took measures to insure the defensibility of\r\nSyracuse. Six thousand persons were employed on a wall three and a half\r\nmiles in length, from the fort of Trogilus to Euryalus, the summit of the\r\nslope of Epipolæ, a high cliff, which commanded the roads to the city. Six\r\nthousand teams of oxen were employed in drawing the stones from the\r\nquarries. This wall was not like Ortygia, a guard-house against the people\r\nof Syracuse, but a defense against external enemies. As it was a great\r\npublic work of defense, the citizens worked with cheerfulness and vigor,\r\nand so enthusiastically did they labor, that the work was completed in\r\ntwenty days. The city being now impregnable, he commenced preparations for\r\noffensive war, and changed his course toward the citizens, pursuing a\r\nmild, and conciliatory policy. He made peace with Messene and Rhegium, and\r\nmarried a lady from Locri. He collected all the best engineers, mechanics,\r\nand artisans from Sicily and Italy, constructed immense machines, provided\r\narms from every nation around the Mediterranean, so that he collected or\r\nfabricated one hundred and forty thousand shields and fourteen thousand\r\nbreastplates, destined for his body-guard and officers, together with a\r\nvast number of helmets, spears, and daggers. All these were accumulated in\r\nhis impregnable fortress of Ortygia. His naval preparations were equally\r\nstupendous. The docks of Syracuse were filled with workmen, and two\r\nhundred triremes were added to the one hundred and ten which already were\r\nhoused in the docks. The trireme was the largest ship of war which for\r\nthree hundred years had sailed in the Grecian or Mediterranean waters. But\r\nDionysius constructed triremes with five banks of oars, and had a navy\r\nvastly superior to what Athens ever possessed. He now hired soldiers from\r\nevery quarter, enlisting Syracusans and the inhabitants of the cities\r\ndepending upon her. He sent envoys to Italy and the Peloponnesus for\r\nrecruits, offering the most liberal pay.\r\n\r\n(M667) When all his preparations were completed, he married, on the same\r\nday, two wives—the Locrian (Doris), and the Syracusan (Aristomache), and\r\nboth of these women lived with him at the same table in equal dignity. He\r\nhad three children by Doris, the oldest of whom was Dionysius the Younger,\r\nand four by Aristomache. When his nuptials had been celebrated with\r\nextraordinary magnificence, and banquets, and fetes, in which the whole\r\npopulation shared, he convoked a public assembly, and exhorted the\r\ncitizens to war against Carthage, as the common enemy of Greece, B.C. 397.\r\nHe then granted permission to plunder the Carthaginian ships in the\r\nharbor, and shortly after marched out from Syracuse with an army against\r\nthe Carthaginians in Sicily, consisting of eighty thousand men, while a\r\nfleet of two hundred triremes and five hundred transports accompanied his\r\nmarch along the coast—the largest military force hitherto assembled under\r\nGrecian command.\r\n\r\n(M668) The first place he attacked was Motya, north of Cape Lilybæum, in\r\nthe western extremity of the island, all the Grecian cities under\r\nCarthaginian leadership having revolted. This city was both populous and\r\nwealthy, built on an islet, which was separated from Sicily by a narrow\r\nstrait two-thirds of a mile in width, bridged over by a narrow mole. The\r\nMotyans, seeing the approach of so formidable an army, broke up their\r\nmole, and insulated themselves from Sicily. The Carthaginians sent a large\r\nfleet to assist Motya, under Imilco, but being inferior to that of\r\nDionysius, it could not venture on a pitched battle. Motya made a\r\ndesperate defense, but a road across the strait being built by the\r\nbesiegers, the new engines of war carried over it were irresistible, the\r\ntown was at length carried and plundered, and the inhabitants slaughtered\r\nor sold as slaves.\r\n\r\n(M669) The siege occupied the summer, and Dionysius, triumphant, returned\r\nto Syracuse. But Imilco being elevated to the chief magistracy of\r\nCarthage, brought over to Sicily an overwhelming force, collected from all\r\nAfrica and Iberia, amounting to one hundred thousand men, afterward\r\nre-enforced by thirty thousand more, at the lowest estimate, with four\r\nhundred ships and six hundred transports. This army disembarked at\r\nPanormus, on the northwestern side of the island (Palermo) retook Motya,\r\nregained Eryx, then marched east and captured Messene, at the extreme\r\neastern part of the island near Italy, which prevented Dionysius from\r\ngetting aid from Italy. The Sikels also rebelled, and Dionysius, greatly\r\ndisquieted by the loss of all his conquests, and by approaching dangers,\r\nstrengthened the fortifications of Syracuse, to which he had retired, and\r\nmade preparations to resist the enemy. He had still a force of thirty\r\nthousand foot and three thousand horse, and one hundred and eighty ships\r\nof war. He sent also to Sparta for aid. He then advanced to Catana. A\r\nnaval battle took place off this city, gained by the Carthaginians, from\r\nsuperior numbers. One hundred of the Syracusan ships were destroyed, with\r\ntwenty thousand men, B.C. 395.\r\n\r\n(M670) After this defeat, Dionysius retreated to Syracuse with his land\r\nforces, amid great discontent, and invoked the aid of Sparta and Corinth.\r\nImilco advanced also to Syracuse, while his victorious fleet occupied the\r\ngreat harbor—a much more imposing armament than that the Athenians had at\r\nthe close of the Persian war. The total number of vessels was two\r\nthousand. Imilco established his head-quarters at the temple of Zeus\r\nOlympius, one mile and a half from the city, and allowed his troops thirty\r\ndays for plunder over the Syracusan territory; then he established\r\nfortified posts, and encircled his camp with a wall, and set down in\r\nearnest to reduce the city to famine. But as he was not master of Epipolæ,\r\nas Nicias was, Syracuse was able to communicate with the country around,\r\nboth west and north, and also found means to secure supplies by sea.\r\n\r\n(M671) Meanwhile the Syracusans defeated a portion of the Carthaginian\r\nfleet, and a terrific pestilence overtook the army before the city. The\r\nmilitary strength of the Carthaginians was prostrated by the terrible\r\nmalady, which swept away one hundred and fifty thousand persons in the\r\ncamp. When thus weakened and demoralized, the Carthaginians were attacked\r\nby the Syracusans, and were completely routed. The fleet was also defeated\r\nand set on fire, and the conflagration reached the camp, which was thus\r\nattacked by pestilence, fire, and sword. The disaster was fatal to the\r\nCarthaginians, and retreat was necessary. Imilco dispatched a secret envoy\r\nto Dionysius, offering three hundred talents if the fleet was allowed to\r\nsail away unmolested to Africa. This could not be permitted, but Imilco\r\nand the native Carthaginians were allowed to retire. The remaining part of\r\nthe army, deprived of their head, was destroyed, with the exception of the\r\nSikels, who knew the roads, and made good their escape.\r\n\r\n(M672) This immense disaster, greater than that the Athenians had suffered\r\nunder Nicias, produced universal mourning and distress at Carthage, while\r\nthe miserable Imilco vainly endeavoring to disarm the wrath of his\r\ncountrymen, shut himself up in his house, and starved himself to death.\r\nThis misfortune led also to a revolt of the African allies, which was\r\nsubdued with difficulty, while the power of Carthage in Sicily was reduced\r\nto the lowest ebb. Dionysius was now left to push his conquests in other\r\ndirections, and Syracuse was rescued from impending ruin.\r\n\r\n(M673) Dionysius had now reigned eleven years, with absolute power. The\r\npestilence, and the treachery of Imilco, had freed him of the\r\nCarthaginians. But a difficulty arose as to the payment of his\r\nmercenaries, which he compromised by giving them the rich territory of\r\nLeontini, so that ten thousand quitted Syracuse, and took up their\r\nresidence in the town. The cost of maintaining a large standing army was\r\nexceeding burdensome, and we only wonder how the tyrant found means to pay\r\nit, and prosecute at the same time such great improvements.\r\n\r\n(M674) He now directed his attention to the Sikels, in the interior of the\r\nisland, and took several of their towns, but from one of them he met with\r\ndesperate resistance, find came near losing his life from a wound by a\r\nspear which penetrated his cuirass. This repulse caused the Carthaginians\r\nto rally in the west of the island, under Magon, with an army of eighty\r\nthousand. But he was repulsed by Dionysius, and concluded a truce with\r\nhim, which gave the latter leisure to make himself master of Messene and\r\nTaurominium—the two most important maritime posts on the Italian side of\r\nSicily, and thus prepare for the invasion of the Greek cities in the south\r\nof Italy, B.C. 391.\r\n\r\n(M675) Dionysius departed from Syracuse, B.C. 389, with a powerful force,\r\nto subdue the Italiot Greeks, and laid siege to Caulonia. He defeated\r\ntheir army, and slew their general. The victor treated the defeated Greeks\r\nwith lenity, and then laid siege to Rhegium, to which he granted peace on\r\nsevere terms. Caulonia and Hipponeum, two cities whose territory occupied\r\nthe breadth of the Calabrian peninsula, fell into his hands. Rhegium\r\nsurrendered after a desperate defense, and Phyton, who commanded the town,\r\nwas treated with brutal inhumanity. The town was dismantled, and all the\r\nterritory of Southern Calabria was united to Locri. It was at this time\r\nthat the peace of Antalcidas took place, which put an end to the Spartan\r\nwars in Asia Minor. The ascendant powers of Greece were now Sparta and\r\nSyracuse, each fortified by alliance with the other.\r\n\r\n(M676) Croton, the largest city in Magna Grecia, was now conquered by\r\nDionysius, who plundered the temple of Ilere, near Cape Lacinium, and\r\namong its treasure was a splendid robe, decorated in the most costly\r\nmanner, which the conqueror sold to the Carthaginians, which long remained\r\none of the ornaments of their city. The value and beauty of the robe may\r\nbe estimated at the price paid for it—one hundred and twenty talents, more\r\nthan one hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n(M677) He now undertook a maritime expedition along the coast of Latium\r\nand Etruria, and pillaged the rich temple at Agylla, stripping it of gold\r\nand ornaments to the value of one thousand talents. So great was the\r\ncelebrity he acquired, that the Gauls of Northern Italy, who had recently\r\nsacked Rome, proffered their alliance and aid. Master of Sicily and\r\nSouthern Italy, he inspired, by his unscrupulous plundering of temples,\r\nthe greatest terror and dislike throughout Central Greece. He then entered\r\nas competitor at the festivals of Greece for the prize of tragic poetry.\r\nBut so contemptible were his poems, they were disgracefully hissed and\r\nridiculed. Especially those poems which were recited at Olympeia—where he\r\nsent legations decked in the richest garments, furnished with gold and\r\nsilver, and provided with splendid tents—were received with a storm of\r\nhisses, which plunged him in an agony of shame and grief, and drove him\r\nnearly mad, and made him conscious of the deep hatred which everywhere\r\nexisted toward him. All his rich displays, which surpassed every thing\r\nthat had ever before been seen in that holy plain, were worse than a\r\nfailure—because they came from him. Not all his grandeur in Syracuse could\r\nsave him from the disgrace and insults which he had received in Olympeia.\r\n\r\n(M678) It was at this time, B.C. 387, that Plato visited Sicily on a\r\nvoyage of inquiry and curiosity, chiefly to see Mount Ætna, and was\r\nintroduced to Dion, then a young man in Syracuse, and brother-in-law to\r\nDionysius. Dion was so impressed with the conversation of Plato, that he\r\ninvited the tyrant to talk with him also. Plato discoursed on virtue and\r\njustice, showing that happiness belonged only to the virtuous, and that\r\ndespots could not lay claim even to the merit of true courage—most\r\nunpalatable doctrine to the tyrant, who became bitterly hostile to the\r\nphilosopher. He even caused Plato to be exposed in the market as a slave,\r\nand sold for twenty minæ, which his friends paid and released him. On his\r\nvoyage home, through the influence of the tyrant, he was again sold at\r\nEgina, and again repurchased, and set at liberty. So bitter are tyrants of\r\nthe virtues which contrast with their misdeeds; and so vindictive\r\nespecially was the despot who reigned at Syracuse.\r\n\r\n(M679) Dionysius was now occupied, by the new defenses and fortifications\r\nof his capital, so that the whole slope of Epipolæ was bordered and\r\nprotected by massive walls and towers, and five divisions of the city had\r\neach its separate fortifications, so that it was the largest fortified\r\ncity in all Greece—larger than Athens herself.\r\n\r\n(M680) The plunder the tyrant had accumulated enabled him to make new\r\npreparations for a war with Carthage. But he was defeated in a great\r\nbattle at Cronium, with terrible loss, by the youthful son of Magon, which\r\ncompelled him to make peace, and cede to Carthage all the territory of\r\nSicily west of the river Halycus, and pay a tribute of one thousand\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\n(M681) Very little is recorded of Dionysius after this peace, B.C. 382,\r\nfor thirteen years, during which the Spartans had made themselves master\r\nof Thebes, and placed a garrison in Cadmea. In the year 368 he made war\r\nagain with Carthage, but was defeated near Lilybæum, and forced to return\r\nto Syracuse. In the year 367 it would seem that he was at last successful\r\nwith his poems, for he gained the prize of tragedy at the Lenæan festival\r\nat Athens, which so intoxicated him with joy, that he invited his friends\r\nto a splendid banquet, and died from the effects of excess and wine, after\r\na reign of thirty-eight years. He was a man of restless energy and\r\nunscrupulous ambition. His personal bravery was great, and he was vigilant\r\nand long sighted—a man of great abilities, sullied by cruelty and\r\njealousy. In his spare time he composed tragedies to compete for prizes.\r\nNo other Greek had ever arrived at so great power from a humble position,\r\nor achieved so striking exploits abroad, or preserved his grandeur so\r\nunimpaired at his death. But he was greatly favored by fortune, especially\r\nwhen the pestilence destroyed the hosts of Imilco. He maintained his power\r\nby intimidation of his subjects, careful organization, and liberal pay to\r\nhis mercenaries. He cared nothing for money excepting as a means to secure\r\ndominion. His exactions were exorbitant, and his rapacity boundless. He\r\ntrusted no one, and his suspicion was extended even to his wives. He\r\nallowed no one to shave him, and searched his most intimate friends for\r\nconcealed weapons before they were allowed in his presence. He made\r\nSyracuse a great fortress, to the injury of Sicily and Italy, and fancied\r\nthat he left his dominions fastened by chains of adamant. He could point\r\nto Ortygia with its impregnable fortifications, to a large army of\r\nmercenaries—to four hundred ships of war, and to vast magazines of arms\r\nand military stores.\r\n\r\n(M682) He left no successor competent to rivet the chains he had forged.\r\nHis son Dionysius succeeded to his throne at the age of twenty-five. His\r\nbrother-in-law Dion was the next prominent member of his family, and\r\npossessed a fortune of one hundred talents—a man of great capacity,\r\nambitious, luxurious, but fond of literature and philosophy. He was,\r\nhowever, so much influenced by Plato, whose Socratic talk and democratic\r\nprinciples enchained and fascinated him, that his character became\r\nessentially modified, and he learned to hate the despotism under which he\r\ngrew up, and formed large schemes for political reform. He aspired to\r\ncleanse Syracuse of slavery, and clothe her in the dignity of freedom, by\r\nestablishing an improved constitutional polity, with laws which secured\r\nindividual rights. He exchanged his luxurious habits for the simple fare\r\nof a philosopher. Never before had Plato met with a pupil who so\r\nprofoundly and earnestly profited from his instructions. The harsh\r\ntreatment which Plato received from the tyrant was a salutary warning to\r\nDion. He saw that patience was imperatively necessary, and he so conducted\r\nas to maintain the favor of Dionysius.\r\n\r\n(M683) Dionysius II. was twenty-five years old when his father died, and\r\nthough he possessed generous impulses, was both weak and vain, given to\r\ncaprice, and insatiate of praise. He had been kept from business from the\r\nexcessive jealousy of his father, and his life had been passed in idleness\r\nand luxury at the palace of Ortygia. His father’s taste for poetry had\r\nintroduced guests to his table whose conversation opened his mind to\r\ngenerous sentiments, but the indecision of his character prevented his\r\nprofiting from any serious studies. Dion supported this feeble novice on\r\nthe throne of his father, and tried to gain influence over him, and\r\nfrankly suggested the measures to be adopted, and Dionysius listened at\r\nfirst to his wise counsels. Dion wished to make Syracuse a free city, with\r\ngood laws, to expel the Carthaginians from Sicily, and replant the\r\nsemi-barbarian Hellenic cities. He also endeavored to reform the life of\r\nDionysius as well as Syracuse, and actually wrought a signal change in his\r\nroyal pupil, so that he desired to see and converse with the great sage\r\nwho had so completely changed the life of Dion, and inspired him with\r\npatriotic enthusiasm. Accordingly, Plato was sent for, who reluctantly\r\nconsented to visit Syracuse. He had no great faith in the despot who\r\nsought his wisdom, and he did not wish, at sixty-one, to leave his\r\nfavorite grove, with admiring disciples from every part of Greece, where\r\nhe reigned as monarch of the mind. He went to Syracuse, not with the hope\r\nso much of converting a weak tyrant, as from unwillingness to desert his\r\nfriend, and be taunted with the impotence of his philosophy. He was\r\nreceived with great distinction at court, and a royal carriage conveyed\r\nhim to his lodgings. The banquets of the Acropolis became distinguished\r\nfor simplicity, and the royal pupil commenced at once in taking lessons in\r\ngeometry. The old courtiers were alarmed, and disgusted. “A single\r\nAthenian sophist,” they said, “with no force but his tongue and\r\nreputation, has achieved the conquest of Syracuse.” Dionysius seemed to\r\nhave abdicated in favor of Plato, and the noble objects for which Dion\r\nlabored seemed to be on the way of fulfillment. But Plato acted\r\ninjudiciously, and spoiled his influence by unreasonable vigor. It was\r\nabsurd to expect that the despot would go to school like a boy, and insist\r\nupon a mental regeneration before he gave him lessons of practical wisdom\r\nin politics. All the necessary reforms were postponed on the ground that\r\nthe royal pupil was not yet ripe for them, and every influence was exerted\r\nto show him his own unworthiness—that his whole past life had been\r\nvicious—delicate ground for any teacher to assume, since he irritated\r\nrather than reformed. He was even averse to any political changes until\r\nDionysius had gone through his schooling. Plato also maintained a proud,\r\nphilosophical dignity, showing no respect to persons, and refusing to the\r\ndefects of his pupil any more indulgence than he granted to those who\r\nlistened to his teachings at home.\r\n\r\n(M684) Such a mistake was attended soon with difficulties. The old\r\ncourtiers recovered their influence. Dion was calumniated and slandered,\r\nas seeking to usurp the sovereign powers, and that Plato was brought to\r\nSyracuse as an agent in the conspiracy. Plato tried to counterwork this\r\nmischief, but in vain. Dionysius lost all inclination to reform, and Dion\r\nwas hated, for he was superior to his nephew in dignity and ability, and\r\nwas haughty and austere in his manners. He was accordingly banished from\r\nSyracuse, and Plato was retained _in the Acropolis_, but was otherwise\r\nwell treated, and entreated to remain. The tyrant, however, refused to\r\nrecall Dion, but consented to the departure of Plato. Another visit to\r\nSyracuse, which he made with the hope of securing the recall of Dion, was\r\na splendid captivity, and although he was treated with extraordinary\r\ndeference, he was not at rest until he obtained permission to depart. He\r\nhad failed in his mission of benevolence and friendship. All the vast\r\npossessions of Dion were confiscated, and Plato had the mortification to\r\nhear of this injury in the very palace to which he went as a reformer.\r\n\r\n(M685) Incensed at the seizure of his property, and hopeless of permission\r\nto return, and of all those reforms which he had projected, Dion now\r\nmeditated the overthrow of the power of Dionysius, and his own restoration\r\nat the point of the sword. During his exile he had chiefly resided in\r\nAthens, enjoying the teaching of his friend Plato, and dispensing his vast\r\nwealth in generous charities. Nor did Plato fully approve of his plans for\r\nthe overthrow of Dionysius, anticipating little good from such violence,\r\nalthough he fully admitted his wrongs. But other friends, less judicious\r\nand more interested, warmly seconded his projects. With aid from various\r\nsources, he at last could muster eight hundred veterans, with which he\r\nventured to attack the most powerful despot in Greece, and in his own\r\nstronghold. And so enthusiastic was Dion, all disparity of forces was a\r\nmatter of indifference. Moreover, he accounted it glory and honor to\r\nperish in so just and noble a cause as the liberation of Sicily from a\r\nweak and cruel despot, every way inferior to his father in character,\r\nthough as strong in resources.\r\n\r\n(M686) But the friends of Dion did not dream of throwing away their lives.\r\nThey calculated on a rising of the Syracusans to throw off an\r\ninsupportable yoke, and they had utter contempt for the tyrant himself,\r\nknowing his drunken habits, and effeminate character, and personal\r\nincompetency. So, after ten years’ exile, Dion, with his followers, landed\r\nin Sicily, at Heracleia, also in the absence of Dionysius, who had quitted\r\nSyracuse for Italy, with eighty triremes, so that the city was easy of\r\naccess.\r\n\r\n(M687) This unaccountable mistake of the tyrant in leaving his capital at\r\nsuch a crisis, was regarded with great joy by the small army of Dion,\r\nwhich marched out at once from Heracleia, and was joined in the\r\nAgrigentian territory with two hundred horsemen. As he approached\r\nSyracuse, other bands joined him, so that he had five thousand men as he\r\napproached the capital. Timocrates, the husband of Dion’s late wife, for\r\nhis wife was taken away from him, was left in command at Syracuse with a\r\nlarge force of mercenaries. But as Dion advanced to the city, there was a\r\ngeneral rising of the citizens, and Timocrates was obliged to return,\r\nleaving the fortresses garrisoned. Dion entered the city by the principal\r\nstreet, which was decorated as on a day of jubilee, and proclaimed liberty\r\nto all. He was also chosen general, with his brother Megacles, and\r\napproached Ortygia, and challenged the garrison to come out and fight. He\r\nthen succeeded in capturing Epipolæ and Eurylæ, those fortified quarters,\r\nand erected a cross wall from sea to sea to block up Ortygia.\r\n\r\n(M688) At the end of seven days, when all these results had been\r\naccomplished, Dionysius returned to Syracuse, but Ortygia was the only\r\nplace which remained to him, and that, too, shut up on the land side by a\r\nblockading wall. The rest of the city was in possession of his enemies,\r\nthough those enemies were subjects. His abdication was imperatively\r\ndemanded by Dion, who refused all conciliation and promises of reform.\r\nRallying, then, his soldiers, he made a sally to surprise the blockading\r\nwall, and was nearly successful, but Dion, at length, repulsed his forces,\r\nand recovered the wall. Ortygia was again blockaded, but as Dionysius was\r\nstill master of the sea, he ravaged the coasts for provisions, and\r\nmaintained his position, until the arrival of Heraclides, with a\r\nPeloponnesian fleet, gave the Syracusans a tolerable naval force.\r\nPhilistus commanded the fleet of Dionysius, but in a battle with\r\nHeraclides, he lost his life.\r\n\r\n(M689) Dionysius now lost all hope of recovering his power by force, and\r\nresorted to intrigues, stimulating the rivalry of Heraclides, and exposing\r\nthe defeats of Dion, whose arrogance and severity were far from making him\r\npopular. Calumnies now began to assail Dion, and he was mistrusted by the\r\nSyracusans, who feared only an exchange of tyrants. There was also an\r\nunhappy dissension between Dion and Heraclides, which resulted in the\r\ndeposition of Dion, and he was forced to retreat from Syracuse, and seek\r\nshelter with the people of Leontini, who stood by him. Dionysius again had\r\nleft Ortygia for Italy, leaving his son in command, and succeeded in\r\nsending re-enforcements from Locri, under Nypsius, so that the garrison of\r\nOrtygia was increased to ten thousand men, with ample stores. Nypsius\r\nsallied from the fortress, mastered the blockading wall, and entered\r\nNeapolis and Achradina, fortified quarters of the city. The Syracusans, in\r\ndistress, then sent to Leontini to invoke the aid of Dion, who returned as\r\nvictor, drove Nypsius into his fortress, and saved Syracuse. He also\r\nmagnanimously pardoned Heraclides, and prosecuted the blockade of Ortygia,\r\nand was again named general. Still Heraclides, who was allowed to command\r\nthe fleet, continued his intrigues, and frustrated the operations against\r\nDionysius. At last, Ortygia surrendered to Dion, who entered the fortress,\r\nwhere he found his wife and sister, from whom he had been separated twelve\r\nyears. At first, Arete, his wife, who had consented to marry Timocrates,\r\nwas afraid to approach him, but he received her with the tenderest emotion\r\nand affection. His son, however, soon after died, having fallen into the\r\ndrunken habits of Dionysius.\r\n\r\n(M690) Dion was now master of Syracuse, and on the pinnacle of power. His\r\nenterprise had succeeded against all probabilities. But prosperity, which\r\nthe Greeks were never able to bear, poisoned all his good qualities and\r\nexaggerated his bad ones. He did not fall into the luxury of his\r\npredecessors. He still wore the habit of a philosopher, and lived with\r\nsimplicity, but he made public mistakes. His manners, always haughty,\r\nbecame repulsive. He despised popularity. He conferred no real liberty. He\r\nretained his dictatorial power. He preserved the fortifications of\r\nOrtygia. He did not meditate a permanent despotism, but meant to make\r\nhimself king, with a modified constitution, like that of Sparta. He had no\r\npopular sympathies, and sought to make Syracuse, like Corinth, completely\r\noligarchial. He took no step to realize any measure of popular freedom,\r\nand, above all, refused to demolish the fortress, behind whose\r\nfortifications the tyrants of Syracuse had intrenched themselves in\r\ndanger. He also caused Heraclides to be privately assassinated, so that\r\nthe Syracusans began to hate him as cordially as they had hated Dionysius.\r\nThis unpopularity made him irritable, and suspicious and disquieted. A\r\nconspiracy, headed by Callippus, put an end to his reign. He was slain by\r\nthe daggers of assassins. Thus perished one of the noblest of the Greeks,\r\nbut without sufficient virtue to bear success. His great defect was\r\ninexperience in government, and it may be doubted whether Plato himself\r\ncould have preserved liberty in so corrupt a city as Syracuse. The\r\ncharacter of Dion also changed greatly by his banishment, since vindictive\r\nsentiments were paramount in his soul. He had a splendid opportunity of\r\nbecoming a benefactor to his country, but this was thrown away, and\r\ninstead of giving liberty he only ruled by force, and moved from bad to\r\nworse, until he made a martyr of the man whom once he magnanimously\r\nforgave. Had he lived longer, he probably would have proved a remorseless\r\ntyrant like Tiberius. So rare is it for men to be temperate in the use of\r\npower, and so much easier is it to give expression to grand sentiments\r\nthan practice the self-restraint which has immortalized the few\r\nWashingtons of the world.\r\n\r\n(M691) The Athenian Callippus, who overturned Dion, remained master of\r\nSyracuse for more than a year, but its condition was miserable and\r\ndeplorable, convulsed by passions and hostile interests. In the midst of\r\nthe anarchy which prevailed, Dionysius contrived to recover Ortygia, and\r\nestablish himself as despot. The Syracusans endured more evil than before,\r\nfor the returned tyrant had animosities to gratify. There was also fresh\r\ndanger from Carthage, so that the Syracusans appealed to their mother\r\ncity, Corinth, for aid. Timoleon was chosen as the general of the forces\r\nto be sent—an illustrious citizen of Corinth, then fifty years of age,\r\ndevoted to the cause of liberty, with hatred of tyrants and wrongs, who\r\nhad even slain his brother when he trampled on the liberties of\r\nCorinth—and a brother whom he loved. But he was forced to choose between\r\nhim and his country, and he chose his country, securing the gratitude of\r\nCorinth, but the curses of his mother and the agonies of self-reproach, so\r\nthat he left for years the haunts of men, and buried himself in the\r\nseverest solitude. Twenty years elapsed from the fratricide to his command\r\nof a force to relieve the Syracusans from their tyrant Dionysius.\r\n\r\n(M692) Timoleon commenced his preparations of ships and soldiers with\r\nalacrity, but his means were scanty, not equal even to those of Dion when\r\nhe embarked on his expedition. He was prevented with his small force from\r\nreaching Sicily by a Carthaginian fleet of superior force, but he effected\r\nhis purpose by stratagem, and landed at Taurominium under great\r\ndiscouragements. He defeated Hicetas, who had invoked the aid of Carthage,\r\nat Adranum, and marched unimpeded to the walls of Syracuse. Dionysius,\r\nblocked up at Ortygia, despaired of his position, and resolved to\r\nsurrender the fortress, stipulating for a safe conveyance and shelter at\r\nCorinth. This tyrant, broken by his drunken habits, did not care to fight,\r\nas his father did, for a sceptre so difficult to be maintained, and only\r\nsought his ease and self-indulgence. So he passed into the camp of\r\nTimoleon with what money he could raise, and the fortress was surrendered.\r\nA re-enforcement from Corinth enabled Timoleon to maintain his ground.\r\n\r\n(M693) The appearance of the fallen tyrant in Corinth produced a great\r\nsensation. Some from curiosity, others from sympathy, and still more from\r\nderision, went to see a man who had enjoyed so long despotic power, now\r\nsuing only for a humble domicile. But his conduct, considering his drunken\r\nhabits, was marked by more dignity than was to be expected from so weak a\r\nman. He is said to have even opened a school to teach boys to read, and to\r\nhave instructed the public singers in reciting poetry. His career, at\r\nleast, was an impressive commentary on the mutability of fortune, to which\r\nthe Greeks were fully alive.\r\n\r\n(M694) Timoleon, in possession of Ortygia, with its numerous stores, found\r\nhimself able to organize a considerable force to oppose the Carthaginians\r\nwho sought to get possession of the fortress. Hicetas, now assisted by a\r\nCarthaginian force under Magon, attacked Ortygia, but was defeated by the\r\nCorinthian Neon, who acquired Achradina, and joined it by a wall to\r\nOrtygia. But Magon now distrusted Hicetas, and suddenly withdrew his army.\r\nTimoleon thus became master of Syracuse, and Hicetas was obliged to retire\r\nto Leontini. Timoleon ascribed his good fortune to the gods, but purchased\r\na greater hold on men’s minds than fortune gave him by his moderation in\r\nthe hour of success—a striking contrast to Dion and the elder Dionysius.\r\nHe invited the Syracusans to demolish the stronghold of tyranny, where the\r\ndespots had so long intrenched themselves. He erected courts of justice on\r\nits site. He recalled the exiles, and invited new colonists to the\r\nimpoverished city, so that sixty thousand immigrants arrived. He relieved\r\nthe poverty and distress of the people by selling the public lands, and\r\nemployed his forces to expel remaining despots from the island.\r\n\r\n(M695) But Hicetas again invited the Carthaginians to Sicily. They came,\r\nwith a vast army of seventy thousand men and twelve hundred ships, under\r\nHasdrubal and Hamilcar, B.C. 340. Timoleon could only assemble twelve\r\nthousand to meet this overwhelming force, but with these he marched\r\nagainst the Carthaginians, and gained a great victory, by the aid of a\r\nterrible storm which pelted the Carthaginians in the face. No victory was\r\never more complete than this at Crimisus. Ten thousand of the invaders\r\nwere slain, and fifteen thousand made prisoners, together with an enormous\r\nspoil.\r\n\r\n(M696) Timoleon had now to deal with two Grecian enemies—Hicetas and\r\nMamercus—tyrants of Leontini and Catana. Over these he gained a complete\r\nvictory, and put them to death. He then, after having delivered Syracuse,\r\nand defeated his enemies, laid down his power, and became a private\r\ncitizen. But his influence remained, as it ought to have been, as great as\r\never, for he was a patriot of most exalted virtue, a counselor whom all\r\ncould trust—a friend who sacrificed his own interests. And he exerted his\r\ninfluence for the restoration of Syracuse, for the introduction of\r\ncolonists, and the enforcement of wise laws. The city was born anew, and\r\nthe gratitude and admiration of the citizens were unbounded. In his latter\r\nyears he became blind, but his presence could not then even be spared when\r\nany serious difficulty arose—ruling by the moral power of wisdom and\r\nsanctity—one of the best and loftiest characters of all antiquity. And\r\nnothing was more remarkable than his patience under contradiction, and his\r\neagerness to insure freedom of speech, even against himself.\r\n\r\n(M697) Thus, by the virtues and wisdom of this remarkable man, were\r\nfreedom and comfort diffused throughout Sicily for twenty-four years,\r\nuntil the despotism of Agathocles. Timoleon died B.C. 337—a father and\r\nbenefactor—and the Syracusans solemnized his funeral with lavish honors,\r\nwhich was attended by a countless procession, and passed a vote to honor\r\nhim for all future time with festive matches, in music and chariot-races,\r\nand such gymnastics as were practiced at the Grecian games. A magnificent\r\nmonument was erected to his memory. “The mournful letters written by Plato\r\nafter the death of Dion contrasts strikingly with the enviable end of\r\nTimoleon, and with the grateful inscription of the Syracusans on his\r\ntomb.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP OF MACEDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M698) No one would have supposed, B.C. 400, that the destruction of\r\nGrecian liberties would come from Macedonia—a semi-barbarous kingdom\r\nwhich, during the ascendency of Sparta, had so little political\r\nimportance. And if any new power threatened to rise over the ruins of the\r\nSpartan State, and become paramount in Greece, it was Thebes. The\r\nsuccesses of Pelopidas and Epaminondas had effectually weakened the power\r\nof Sparta. She no longer enjoyed the headship of Greece. She no longer was\r\nthe leader of dependent allies, submitting to her dictation in all\r\nexternal politics, serving under the officers she appointed, administering\r\ntheir internal affairs by oligarchies devoted to her purposes, and even\r\nsubmitting to be ruled by governors whom she put over them. She had lost\r\nher foreign auxiliary force and dignity, and even half of her territory in\r\nLaconia. The Peloponnesians, who once rallied around her were disunited,\r\nand Megalopolis and Messene were hostile. Corinth, Sicyon, Epidaurus, and\r\nother cities, formerly allies, stood aloof, and the grand forces of Hellas\r\nnow resided outside of the Peloponnesus. Athens and Thebes were the new\r\nseats of power. Athens had regained her maritime supremacy, and Thebes was\r\nformidable on the land, having absorbed one-third of the Bœotian\r\nterritory, and destroyed three or four autonomous cities, and secured\r\npowerful allies in Thessaly.\r\n\r\n(M699) When the battle of Mantinea was fought, at which Epaminondas lost\r\nhis life, Perdiccas, son of Amyntas, was the king of Macedonia. He was\r\nslain, in the flower of his life, in a battle with the Illyrians, B.C.\r\n359. On the advice of Plato, who had been his teacher, he was induced to\r\nbestow upon his brother Philip a portion of territory in Macedonia, who\r\nfor three years preceding had been living in Thebes as a hostage, carried\r\nthere by Pelopidas at fifteen years of age, when he had reduced Macedonia\r\nto partial submission.\r\n\r\n(M700) At Thebes the young prince was treated with courtesy, and resided\r\nwith one of the principal citizens, and received a good education. He was\r\nalso favored with the society of Pelopidas and Epaminondas, and witnessed\r\nwith great interest the training of the Theban forces by these two\r\nremarkable men—one the greatest organizer, and the other the greatest\r\ntactician of the age. When transferred from Thebes to a subordinate\r\ngovernment of a district in his brother’s kingdom, he organized a military\r\nforce on the principles he had learned in Thebes. The unexpected death of\r\nPerdiccas, leaving an infant son, opened to him the prospect of succeeding\r\nto the throne. He first assumed the government as guardian of his young\r\nnephew Amyntas, but the difficulties with which he was surrounded, having\r\nmany competitors from other princes of the family of Amyntas, his father,\r\nthat he assumed the crown, putting to death one of his half brothers,\r\nwhile the other two fled into exile.\r\n\r\n(M701) His first proceeding as king was to buy the Thracians, his enemies,\r\nby presents and promises, so that only the Athenians and the Illyrians\r\nremained formidable. But he made peace with Athens by yielding up\r\nAmphipolis, for the possession of which the Athenians had made war in\r\nMacedonia.\r\n\r\n(M702) The Athenians, however, neglected to take possession of Amphipolis,\r\nbeing engaged in a struggle to regain the island of Eubœa, then under the\r\ndominion of Thebes. It also happened that a revolt of a large number of\r\nthe islands of the Ægean, which belonged to the confederacy of which\r\nAthens was chief, took place—Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Cos, and Rhodes,\r\nincluding Byzantium. This revolt is called the social war, caused by the\r\nselfishness of Athens in acting more for her own interest than that of her\r\nallies, and neglecting to pay the mercenaries in her service. The revolt\r\nwas also stimulated by the intrigues of the Carian prince, Mausolus. But\r\nit was a serious blow to the foreign ascendency of Athens, and in a battle\r\nto recover these islands, the Athenians, under Chabrias, were defeated at\r\nChios. They were also unsuccessful on the Hellespont from quarrels among\r\ntheir generals—Timotheus, Iphicrates, and Chares. The popular voice at\r\nAthens laid the blame of defeat on the two former unjustly, in consequence\r\nof which Timotheus was fined one hundred talents, the largest fine ever\r\nimposed at Athens, and shortly after died in exile—a distinguished man,\r\nwho had signally maintained the honor and glory of his country. Iphicrates\r\nalso was never employed again. The loss of these two generals could\r\nscarcely be repaired. Soon after, peace was made with the revolted cities,\r\nby which their independence and autonomy were guaranteed. This was an\r\ninglorious result of the war to Athens, and fatally impaired her power and\r\ndignity, so that she was unable to make a stand against the aggressions of\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n(M703) One of the first things he did after defeating the Illyrians was to\r\nlay siege to Amphipolis, although he had ceded the city to Athens. For\r\nthis treachery there was no other reason than ambition and the weakened\r\npower of Athens. Amphipolis had long remained free, and was not disposed\r\nto give up its liberties, and sent to Athens for aid. Philip, an arch\r\npolitician, contrived by his intrigues to prevent Athens from giving\r\nassistance. The neglect of Athens was a great mistake, for Amphipolis\r\ncommanded the passage over the Strymon, and shut up Macedonia from the\r\neast, and was, moreover, easily defensible by sea. Deprived of aid from\r\nAthens, the city fell into the hands of Philip, and was an acquisition of\r\ngreat importance. It was the most convenient maritime station in Thrace,\r\nand threw open to him all the country east of the Strymon, and especially\r\nthe gold region near Mount Pangreus. This place henceforward became one of\r\nthe bulwarks of Macedonia, until the Roman conquest.\r\n\r\n(M704) Having obtained this place, he commenced, without a declaration of\r\nwar against Athens, a series of hostile measures, while he professed to be\r\nher friend. He deprived her of her hold upon the Thermaic Gulf, conquered\r\nPydna and Potidæa, and conciliated Olynthus. His power was thus so far\r\nincreased that he founded a new city, called Philippi, in the regions\r\nwhere his gold mines yielded one thousand talents yearly. He then married\r\nOlympias, daughter of a prince of the Molossi, who gave birth, in the year\r\nB.C. 356, to a son destined to conquer the world.\r\n\r\n(M705) The capture of Amphipolis by Philip was, of course, followed by war\r\nwith Athens, which lasted twelve years. And this war commenced at a time\r\nAthens was in great embarrassments, owing to the social war.\r\n\r\n(M706) But he was aided by another event of still greater importance—the\r\nsacred war, which for a time convulsed the Hellenic world, and which grew\r\nout of the accusation of Thebes, before the Amphictyonic Council, that\r\nSparta had seized her citadel in time of profound peace. The sentence of\r\nthe council, that Sparta should pay a fine of five hundred talents, was a\r\ndeparture of Grecian custom, and Sparta refused to pay it, which refusal\r\nled to her exclusion from the council, the Delphic temple, and the Pythian\r\ngames, and this exclusion again arrayed the different States of Greece\r\nagainst each other, as to the guardianship of the Oracle itself.\r\n\r\nPhilip of Macedon seized this opportunity, when so many States were\r\nengaged in war, to prosecute his schemes. He attacked Methone, the last\r\nremaining possession of Athens on the Macedonian coast, and captured the\r\ncity, and then advanced into Thessaly against the despots of Pheræ, who\r\ninvoked the aid of Onomarchus, now very powerful.\r\n\r\n(M707) It was at this time, B.C. 353, that Demosthenes, the orator,\r\nappeared before the Athenian people. He was about twenty-seven years of\r\nage, and the wealth of his father secured him great advantages in\r\neducation. His father died while he was young, and his property was\r\nconfided to the care of guardians, named in his father’s will. But they\r\nadministered the property with such negligence, that only a small sum came\r\nto Demosthenes when he attained his civil majority, at the age of sixteen.\r\nAfter repeated complaints, he brought a judicial action against one of the\r\nguardians, and obtained verdict against him to the extent of ten talents.\r\nBut the guardian delayed the payment, and Demosthenes lost nearly all his\r\npatrimony. He had, however, received a good education, and in spite of a\r\nfeeble constitution, he mastered all the learning of the age. His family\r\ninfluence enabled him to get an early introduction to public affairs, and\r\nhe proceeded to train himself as a speaker, and a writer of speeches for\r\nothers. He put himself under the teaching of a famous rhetorician, Iænus,\r\nand profited by the discourses of Plato and Isocrates then in the height\r\nof their fame. He also was a great student of Thucydides, and copied his\r\nwhole history, with his own hand, eight times. He still had to contend\r\nagainst a poor voice, and an ungraceful gesticulation; but by unwearied\r\nlabor he overcame his natural difficulties so as to satisfy the most\r\ncritical Athenian audience. But this conquest in self-education was only\r\nmade by repeated trials and humiliations, and it is said he even spoke\r\nwith pebbles in his mouth, and prepared himself to overcome the noise of\r\nthe Assembly by declaiming in stormy weather on the sea-shore. He\r\nsometimes passed two or three mouths in a subterranean chamber, practicing\r\nby day and by night, both in composition and declamation, such pains did\r\nthose old Greeks take to perfect themselves in art; for public speaking is\r\nan art, as well as literary composition. He learned Sophocles by heart,\r\nand took lessons from actors even to get the true accent. It was several\r\nyears before he was rewarded with success, and then his delivery was full\r\nof vehemence and energy, but elaborate and artificial. But it was not more\r\nlabor which made Demosthenes the greatest orator of antiquity, and\r\nperhaps, of all ages and nations, but also natural genius. His\r\nself-training merely developed the great qualities of which he was\r\nconscious, as was Disraeli when he made his early failures in Parliament.\r\nWithout natural gifts of eloquence, he might have worked till doomsday\r\nwithout producing the extraordinary effect which is ascribed to him, for\r\nhis speeches show great insight, genius, and natural force, as well as\r\nlearning, culture, and practice; so that they could be read like the\r\nspeeches of Burke and Webster, with great effect. He had great political\r\nsagacity, moral wisdom, elevation of sentiment, and patriotic ardor, as\r\nwell as art. He would have been great, if he had stammered all his life.\r\nHe composed speeches for other great orators before he had confidence in\r\nhis own eloquence.\r\n\r\n(M708) In contrast with Demosthenes, who was rich, was Phocion, who\r\nremained poor, and would receive neither money nor gifts. He went\r\nbarefoot, like Socrates, and had only one female slave in his household,\r\nwas personally incorruptible, and also brave in battle, so that he was\r\nelected to the office of strategus, or general, forty-five times, without\r\never having solicited place or been present at the election. He had great\r\ncontempt of fine speeches, yet was most effective as an orator for his\r\nbrevity, good sense, and patriotism, and despised the “warlike eloquence,\r\nun-warlike despotism, paid speech-writing, and delicate habits of\r\nDemosthenes.”\r\n\r\n(M709) This Athenian, with Spartan character and habits, was opposed to\r\nthe war with Philip, and was therefore the leading opponent of\r\nDemosthenes, whose foresight and sagacity led him to penetrate the schemes\r\nof the Macedonian king. But the Athenians were generally induced to a\r\npeace policy in degenerate times, and did not sympathize with the lofty\r\nprinciples which Demosthenes declared, and hence the influence of Phocion,\r\nthough of commanding patriotism and morality, was mischievous, while that\r\nof Demosthenes was good. The citizens of Athens, enriched by commerce and\r\nenervated by leisure, were at this time averse to the burdens of military\r\nservice, and formed a striking contrast to their ancestors one hundred\r\nyears earlier, in the time of Pericles. In the time of Demosthenes, they\r\nsought home pleasures, the refinements of art, and the enjoyments of\r\ncultivated life, not warlike enterprises. And this decline in military\r\nspirit was equally noticeable in the cities of the Peloponnesus. And hence\r\nthe cities of Greece resorted to mercenaries, like Carthage, and intrusted\r\nto them the defense of their liberties. The warlike spirit of ancient\r\nSparta and Athens now was pre-eminent in Macedonia, where the people were\r\npoor, hardy, adventurous and bold.\r\n\r\nIt was against these warlike Macedonians, rude and hardy, that the refined\r\nAthenians were now to contend, led by a prince of uncommon military\r\ntalents and insatiable ambition, and who joined craft to bravery and\r\ngenius. Demosthenes in vain invoked the ancient spirit which had inspired\r\nthe heroes of Marathon.\r\n\r\n(M710) In the year 383 B.C., Philip attacked Lyeophron, of Pheræ, in\r\nThessaly. Onomarchus, then victorious over the Thebans, advanced against\r\nPhilip, and defeated him in two battles, so that the Macedonian army\r\nwithdrew from Thessaly. But Philip repaired his losses, marched again into\r\nThessaly, defeated the Phocians, and slew Onomarchus. His conquest of\r\nPheræ was now easy, and he rapidly made himself master of all Thessaly,\r\nand expelled Lycophron. He then marched to Thermopylæ, to the great alarm\r\nof Athens, which sent a force to resist him, which force succeeded in\r\ndefending the pass, and keeping Philip, for a time, from entering Southern\r\nGreece. The Phocians also rallied, again availed themselves of the\r\ntreasure of Delphi, and melted down the golden ornaments and vessels which\r\nCrœsus, the Lydian king, had given one hundred years before, among which\r\nwere three hundred and sixty golden goblets, from the proceeds of which a\r\nnew army of mercenaries was raised.\r\n\r\n(M711) The power of Philip was now exceedingly formidable, and his\r\nsuccesses inspired great alarm throughout Greece, as would appear from the\r\nfirst Philippic of Demosthenes, delivered in B.C. 352. But the Grecian\r\nStates had no general able to cope with him on the land, while he created\r\na navy to annoy the Athenians at sea.\r\n\r\n(M712) For a time, however, the efforts of Philip were diverted from\r\nSouthern and Central Greece, in order to conquer the Olynthians. They were\r\nhis neighbors, and had been his allies; but the expulsion of the Athenians\r\nfrom the coast of Thrace and Macedonia now alarmed the Olynthians,\r\ntogether with the increasing power of Philip, so that they concluded a\r\ntreaty of peace with Athens. Hostilities broke out in the year 350 B.C.,\r\nand Demosthenes put forward all his eloquence to excite his countrymen to\r\nvigorous war. Athens, partially aroused, sent a body of mercenaries to the\r\nassistance of Olynthus, one of the most flourishing of the cities of\r\nChalcidia, southeast of Macedonia. But before effective aid could he\r\nrendered, the island of Eubœa, through the intrigues of Philip, revolted\r\nfrom Athens. It was in an expedition to recover that island that\r\nDemosthenes served as a hoplite in the army, under Phocion as general. It\r\nwas not till the summer of B.C. 348 that this territory was recovered by\r\nAthens. In the year following, Athens made great exertions in behalf of\r\nOlynthus, and amid great financial embarrassments. Three expeditions were\r\nsent into Chalcidia, under the command of Chares, numbering altogether\r\nfour thousand Athenians and ten thousand mercenaries. But they were\r\npowerless against the conquering arms of Philip, who completely overran\r\nand devastated the peninsula, taking thirty-two cities, and selling the\r\npeople for slaves. At last Olynthus fell, B.C. 347, and the spoils of this\r\nold Hellenic city were divided among the soldiers of the conqueror, who\r\ncelebrated his victories by a splendid festival.\r\n\r\nNo such calamity had befallen Greece for a century as the conquest of\r\nChalcidia, and it filled Athens with unspeakable alarms. Æschines, the\r\nrival of Demosthenes as an orator, now joined with him in denouncing\r\nPhilip as the common enemy of Greece. Aristodemus was sent to him with\r\npropositions of peace, and Philip professed to entertain them favorably,\r\nwith his characteristic duplicity.\r\n\r\n(M713) Meanwhile the sacred war had impoverished the Phocians, and there\r\nwere dissensions among themselves. Their temple of Delphi had already been\r\nstripped of the enormous sum of ten thousand talents, eleven million five\r\nhundred thousand dollars, probably equal in our times to two hundred and\r\nthirty million dollars; so that it must have been richer, when the\r\nrelative value of gold and silver is considered, than any church in\r\nChristendom. The treasures of the temple, enriched for three hundred years\r\nby offerings from all parts of the world, still enabled the Phocians to\r\nmaintain war with Thebes. At last the Thebans invoked the aid of Philip,\r\nand a Macedonian army, under Parmenio, advanced as far as Thessaly. But\r\nthe Phocians, in alarm, entreated both Sparta and Athens for assistance.\r\nThe crisis was great, for if Philip should once secure the Pass of\r\nThermopylæ, all Southern Greece was in imminent danger. The whole defense\r\nof Greece now turned upon this Pass, of as much importance to Philip as to\r\nAthens and Sparta, for it was the only road into Greece. Envoys were again\r\nsent from Athens to Philip, to learn on what conditions peace could be\r\nsecured, among whom were Demosthenes and Æschines. But he would grant no\r\nbetter terms than that each party should retain what they already\r\npossessed, and the Athenians consented. Philip reaped all the advantages\r\nof a peace, which gave him the possession of the cities and territory he\r\nhad taken. The Phocians were left out in the negotiations, a fatal step,\r\nsince it required the united forces of Greece from preventing the further\r\nencroachments of the Macedonian king. He had now leisure for the\r\ncompletion of the conquest of Thrace. When this was completed, he marched\r\ntoward Thermopylæ, which was held by the Phocians, carefully veiling his\r\nreal intentions, and even pretending that his advance to the south was for\r\nthe purpose of reconstituting the Bœotian cities and putting down Thebes.\r\nHis real object was to surprise the Pass, for he was a man who had very\r\nlittle respect to treaties, promises, or oaths. All this while he\r\ncontrived to deceive Athens and the Phocians, with the connivance of\r\nÆschines, whom he had bribed or cheated. But he did not deceive\r\nDemosthenes, who entreated his countrymen to make a stand against him,\r\neven at the eleventh hour, for he was then within three days’ march of the\r\nPass. But the eloquence and warnings of Demosthenes were in vain. The\r\npeople went with Æschines, who persuaded them that Philip was friendly to\r\nAthens and only hostile to Thebes. It was the design of Philip to detach\r\nAthens from the Phocians, and thus make his conquest easier; and he\r\nsucceeded by his falsehoods and intrigues. Under these circumstances, the\r\nPhocians surrendered to Philip the pass, which they ought to have defended\r\nat all hazard, and the king retired to Phocis, but still professed the\r\ngreatest friendship for Athens, with whom he made peace.\r\n\r\n(M714) Master now of Phocis, with a triumphant army, he openly joined the\r\nThebans and restored the Temple of Delphi to its inhabitants, and convoked\r\nthe Amphictyonic Council, which dispossessed the Phocians of their place\r\nin the assembly, and conferred it upon Philip. The unhappy Phocians were\r\nnow reduced to a state of utter ruin. Their towns were dismantled, and\r\ntheir villages were not allowed to contain over fifty houses each. They\r\nwere stripped, and slain, and their fields laid waste. Philip was now\r\nmaster of the keys of Greece, and the recognized leader of the\r\nAmphictyonic Council. Athens had secured an inglorious peace with her\r\nenemy, through the corruption of her own envoys, B.C. 346, and was soon to\r\nreap the penalty of her credulity and indolence. She allowed herself to be\r\ndeceived, and Philip, in co-operation with Thebes, the enemy of Athens,\r\npresently threw off the mask and disgracefully renewed the war with\r\nAthens, He had gained his object by bribery and falsehood. It is mournful\r\nthat the Athenians should not have listened to the warnings of the most\r\nsagacious patriot who adorned those degenerate times, but the influence of\r\nÆschines was then paramount, and he was sold to Philip. He cried peace,\r\nwhen there was no peace. The great error of Athens was in not rendering\r\ntimely assistance to the Phocians, who possessed the Pass of Thermopylæ,\r\nalthough they had brought upon themselves the indignation of Greece by the\r\nseizure of the Delphic treasures.\r\n\r\n(M715) The victories and encroachments of Philip, within the line of\r\ncommon Grecian defense, were profoundly lamented by Demosthenes, and he\r\nnow felt that it was expedient to keep on terms of peace with so powerful\r\nand unscrupulous and cunning a man. Isocrates wished Philip to reconcile\r\nthe four great cities of Greece, Sparta, Athens, Thebes, and Argos, put\r\nhimself at the head of their united forces, and Greece generally, invade\r\nPersia, and liberate the Asiatic Greeks. But this was putting the Hellenic\r\nworld under one man, and renouncing the independence of States and the\r\nautonomy of cities—the great principles of Grecian policy from the\r\nearliest historic times, and therefore a complete subversion of Grecian\r\nliberties, and the establishment of a centralized power under Philip,\r\nwhose patrimonial kingdom was among the least civilized in Greece.\r\n\r\n(M716) The peace between Philip and Athens lasted, without any formal\r\nrenunciation, for six years, during which the Macedonian king pursued his\r\naggressive policy and his intrigues in all the States of Greece. His\r\npolicy was precisely that of Rome when it meditated the conquest of the\r\nworld, only his schemes were confined chiefly to Greece. Every year his\r\npower increased, while the States of Greece remained inactive and\r\nuncombined—a proof of the degeneracy of the times—certainly in regard to\r\nself-sacrifices to secure their independence. Demosthenes plainly saw the\r\napproaching absorption of Greece in the Macedonian dominion, unless the\r\nStates should unite for common defense; and he took every occasion to\r\ndenounce Philip, not only in Athens, but to the envoys of the different\r\nStates. The counsels of the orator were a bitter annoyance to the despot,\r\nwho sent to Athens letters of remonstrance.\r\n\r\n(M717) At last an occasion was presented for hostilities by the refusal of\r\nthe Athenians to allow Philip to take possession of the island of\r\nHalicarnassus, claiming the island as their own. Reprisals took place, and\r\nPhilip demanded the possession of the Hellespont and Bosphorus, and the\r\nGreek cities on their coast, of the greatest value to Athens, since she\r\nrelied upon the possession of the straits for the unobstructed importation\r\nof corn. The Athenians now began to realize the encroaching ambition of\r\nPhilip, and to listen to Demosthenes, who, about this time, B.C. 341,\r\ndelivered his third Philippic. From this time to the battle of Chæronea,\r\nthe influence of Demosthenes was greater than that of any other man in\r\nAthens, which too late listened to his warning voice. Through his\r\ninfluence, Eubœa was detached from Philip, and also Byzantium, and they\r\nwere brought into alliance with Athens. Philip was so much chagrined that\r\nhe laid siege to Perinthus, and marched through the Chersonese, which was\r\npart of the Athenian territory, upon which Athens declared war. Philip, on\r\nhis side, issued a manifesto declaring his wrongs, as is usual with\r\nconquerors, and announced his intention of revenge. The Athenians fitted\r\nout a fleet and sent it under Chares to the Hellespont. Philip prosecuted,\r\non his part, the siege of Perinthus, on the Propontis, with an army of\r\nthirty thousand men, with a great number of military engines. One of his\r\nmovable towers was one hundred and twenty feet high, so that he was able\r\nto drive away the defenders of the walls by missiles. He succeeded in\r\ndriving the citizens of this strong town into the city, and it would have\r\nshared the fate of Olynthus, had it not been relieved by the Byzantine and\r\nGrecian mercenaries. Philip was baffled, after a siege of three months,\r\nand turned his forces against Byzantium, but this town was also relieved\r\nby the Athenians, and the inhabitants from the islands of the Ægean. These\r\noperations lasted six mouths, and were the greatest adverses which Philip\r\nhad as yet met with. A vote of thanks was decreed by the Athenians to\r\nDemosthenes, who had stimulated these enterprises. Philip was obliged to\r\nwithdraw from Byzantium, and retreated to attack the Scythians. An\r\nimportant reform in the administration of the marine was effected by\r\nDemosthenes, although opposed by the rich citizens and by Æschines.\r\n\r\n(M718) While these events transpired, a new sacred war was declared by the\r\nAmphictyonic Council against the Locrians of Amphissa, kindled by\r\nÆschines, which more than compensated Philip for his repulse at Byzantium,\r\nbringing advantage to him and ruin to Grecian liberty. But the Athenians\r\nstood aloof from this suicidal war, when all the energies of Greece were\r\ndemanded to put down the encroachments of Philip. As was usual in these\r\nintestine troubles, the weaker party invoked the aid of a foreign power,\r\nand the Amphictyonic Assembly, intent on punishing Amphissa, sought\r\nassistance from Philip. He, of course, accepted the invitation, and\r\nmarched south through Thermopylæ, proclaiming his intention to avenge the\r\nDelphian god. In his march he took Nicæa from the Thebans, and entered\r\nPhocis, and converted Elatea into a permanent garrison. Hitherto he had\r\nonly proclaimed himself as a general acting under the Amphictyonic vote to\r\navenge the Delphian god,—now he constructed a military post in the heart\r\nof Greece.\r\n\r\n(M719) Thebes, ever since the battle of Leuctra, had been opposed to\r\nAthens, and even now unfriendly relations existed between the two cities,\r\nand Philip hoped that Thebes would act in concert with him against Athens.\r\nBut this last outrage of Philip exceedingly alarmed Athens, and\r\nDemosthenes stood up in the Assembly to propose an embassy to Thebes with\r\noffers of alliance. His advice was adopted, and he was dispatched with\r\nother envoys to Thebes. The Athenian orator, in spite of the influence of\r\nthe Macedonian envoys, carried his point with the Theban Assembly, and an\r\nalliance was formed between Thebes and Athens. The Athenian army marched\r\nat once to Thebes, and vigorous measures were made at Athens for the\r\ndefensive war which so seriously threatened the loss of Grecian liberty.\r\nThe alliance was a great disappointment to Philip, who remained at Phocis,\r\nand sent envoys to Sparta, inviting the Peloponnesians to join him against\r\nAmphissa. But the Thebans and Athenians maintained their ground against\r\nhim, and even gained some advantages. Among other things, they\r\nreconstituted the Phocian towns. The Athenians and their allies had a\r\nforce of fifteen thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry, and\r\nDemosthenes was the war minister by whom these forces were collected.\r\nThese efforts on the part of Thebes and Athens led to renewed preparations\r\non the part of Philip. He defeated a large body of mercenaries, and took\r\nAmphissa. Unfortunately, the Athenians had no general able to cope with\r\nhim, and it was the work of Demosthenes merely to keep up the courage of\r\nhis countrymen and incite them to effort.\r\n\r\n(M720) At last, in the month of August, Philip, with thirty thousand foot\r\nand two thousand horse, met the allied Greeks at Chæronea, the last\r\nBœotian town on the frontiers of Phocis. The command of the armies of the\r\nallies was shared between the Thebans and Athenians, but their movements\r\nwere determined by a council of civilians and generals, of which\r\nDemosthenes was the leading spirit. Philip, in this battle, which decided\r\nthe fortunes of Greece, commanded the right wing, opposed to the\r\nAthenians, and his son Alexander, the left wing, opposed to the Thebans.\r\nThe Macedonian phalanx, organized by Philip, was sixteen deep, with\r\nveteran soldiers in the front. The Theban “Sacred Band” was overpowered\r\nand broken by its tremendous force, much increased by the long pikes which\r\nprojected in front of the foremost soldiers. But the battle was not gained\r\nby the phalanx alone. The organization of the Macedonian army was perfect,\r\nwith many other sorts of troops, bodyguards, light hoplites, light\r\ncavalry, bowmen, and slingers. One thousand Athenians were slain, and two\r\nthousand more were made captives. The Theban loss was still greater.\r\n\r\n(M721) Unspeakable was the grief and consternation of Athens, when the\r\nintelligence reached her of this decisive victory. A resolution was at\r\nonce taken for a vigorous defense of the city. All citizens sent in their\r\ncontributions, and every hand was employed on the fortifications. The\r\ntemples were stripped of arms, and envoys were sent to various places for\r\naid.\r\n\r\n(M722) Thebes was unable to rally, and fell into the hands of the victors,\r\nand a Macedonian garrison was placed in the Cadmea, or citadel. From\r\nAthens, envoys were sent to Philip for peace, which was granted on the\r\ncondition that he should be recognized as the chief of the Hellenic world.\r\nIt was a great humiliation to Athens to concede this, after having\r\ndefeated the Persian hosts, and keeping out so long all foreign\r\ndomination. But times had changed, and the military spirit had fled.\r\n\r\nAthens was not prostrated by the battle of Chæronea. She still retained\r\nher navy, and her civic rights. Thebes was utterly prostrated, and never\r\nrallied again.\r\n\r\n(M723) Philip, having now subjugated Thebes, and constrained Athens into\r\nsubmission, next proceeded to carry his arms into the Peloponnesus. He\r\nfound but little resistance, except in Laconia. The Corinthians, Argeians,\r\nMessenians, Elians, and Arcadians submitted to his power. Even Sparta\r\ncould make but feeble resistance. He laid waste Laconia, and then convened\r\na congress of Grecian cities at Corinth, and announced his purpose to\r\nundertake an expedition against the king of Persia, avenge the invasion of\r\nGreece by Xerxes, and liberate the Asiatic Greeks. A large force of two\r\nhundred thousand foot and fifteen thousand horse was promised him, and all\r\nthe States of Greece concurred, except Sparta, which held aloof from the\r\ncongress. Athens was required to furnish a well equipped fleet. All the\r\nStates, and all the islands, and all the cities of Greece, were now\r\nsubservient to Philip, and no one State could exercise control over its\r\nformer territories.\r\n\r\n(M724) It was in the year B.C. 337, that this great scheme for the\r\ninvasion of Persia was concerted, which created no general enthusiasm,\r\nsince Persia was no longer a power to be feared. The only power to be\r\nfeared now was Macedonia. While preparations were going on for this\r\nfoolish and unnecessary expedition, the prime mover of it was\r\nassassinated, and his career, so disastrous to Grecian liberty, came to an\r\nend. It seems that he had repudiated his wife, Olympias, disgusted with\r\nthe savage impulses of her character, and married, for his last wife, for\r\nhe had several, Cleopatra, which provoked bitter dissensions among the\r\npartisans of the two queens, and also led to a separation between himself\r\nand his son Alexander, although a reconciliation afterward took place. It\r\nwas while celebrating the marriage of his daughter by Olympias, with\r\nAlexander, king of Epirus, and also the birth of a son by Cleopatra, that\r\nPausanias, one of the royal body-guard, who nourished an implacable hatred\r\nof Philip, chose his opportunity, and stabbed him with a short sword he\r\nhad concealed under his garment.\r\n\r\n(M725) Alexander, the son of Philip by Olympias, was at once declared\r\nking, whose prosecution of the schemes of his father are to be recounted\r\nin the next chapter. Philip perished at the age of forty-seven, after a\r\nmost successful reign of twenty-three years. On his accession he found his\r\nkingdom a narrow territory around Pella, excluded from the sea-coast. At\r\nhis death the Macedonian kingdom was the most powerful in Greece, and all\r\nthe States and cities, except Sparta, recognized its ascendency. He had\r\ngained this great power, more from the weakness and dissensions of the\r\nGrecian States, than from his own strength, great as were his talents. He\r\nbecame the arbiter of Greece by unscrupulous perjury and perpetual\r\nintrigues. But he was a great organizer, and created a most efficient\r\narmy. Without many accomplishments, he affected to be a patron of both\r\nletters and religion. His private life was stained by character or\r\ndrunkenness, gambling, perfidy, and wantonness. His wives and mistresses\r\nwere as numerous as those of an Oriental despot. He was a successful man,\r\nbut it must be borne in mind that he had no opponents like Epaminondas, or\r\nAgesilaus, or Iphicrates. Demosthenes was his great opponent, but only in\r\ncounsels and speech. The generals of Athens, and Sparta, and Thebes had\r\npassed away, and with the decline of military spirit, it is not remarkable\r\nthat Philip should have ascended to a height from which he saw the Grecian\r\nworld suppliant at his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER THE GREAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M726) We come now to consider briefly the career of Alexander, the son of\r\nPhilip—the most successful, fortunate, and brilliant hero of antiquity. I\r\ndo not admire either his character or his work. He does not compare the\r\nwith Cæsar or Napoleon in comprehensiveness of genius, or magnanimity, or\r\nvariety of attainments, or posthumous influences. He was a meteor—a star\r\nof surprising magnitude, which blazed over the whole Oriental world with\r\nunprecedented brilliancy. His military genius was doubtless great—even\r\ntranscendent, and his fame is greater than his genius. His prestige is\r\nwonderful. He conquered the world more by his name than by his power. Only\r\ntwo men, among military heroes, dispute his pre-eminence in the history of\r\nnations. After more than two thousand years, his glory shines with\r\nundiminished brightness. His conquests extended over a period of only\r\ntwelve years, yet they were greater and more dazzling than any man ever\r\nmade before in a long reign. Had he lived to be fifty, he might have\r\nsubdued the whole world, and created a universal empire equal to that of\r\nthe Cæsars—which was the result of five hundred years’ uninterrupted\r\nconquests by the greatest generals of a military nation. Though we neither\r\nlove nor reverence Alexander, we can not withhold our admiration, for his\r\nalmost superhuman energy, courage, and force of will. He looms up as one\r\nof the prodigies of earth—yet sent by Providence as an avenger—an\r\ninstrument of punishment on those effeminated nations, or rather\r\ndynasties, which had triumphed over human misery. I look upon his career,\r\nas the Christians of the fifth century looked upon that of Alaric or\r\nAttila, whom they called the scourge of God.\r\n\r\n(M727) His conquests and dominions were, however, prepared by one perhaps\r\ngreater than himself in creative genius, and as unscrupulous and cruel as\r\nhe. Philip found his kingdom a little brook; he left it a river—broad,\r\ndeep, and grand. Under Alexander, this river became an irresistible\r\ntorrent, sweeping every thing away which impeded its course. Philip\r\ncreated an army, and a military system, and generals, all so striking,\r\nthat Greece succumbed before him, and yielded up her liberties. Alexander\r\nhad only to follow out his policy, which was to subdue the Persians. The\r\nPersian empire extended over all the East—Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt,\r\nParthia, Babylonia, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Bactria, and other countries—the\r\none hundred and twenty provinces of Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus, from the\r\nMediterranean to India, from the Euxine and Caspian Seas to Arabia and the\r\nPersian Gulf—a monstrous empire, whose possession was calculated to\r\ninflame the monarchs who reigned at Susa and Babylon with more than mortal\r\npride and self-sufficiency. It had been gradually won by successive\r\nconquerors, from Nimrod to Darius. It was the gradual absorption of all\r\nthe kingdoms of the East in the successive Assyrian, Babylonian, and\r\nPersian empires—for these three empires were really one under different\r\ndynasties, and were ruled by the same precedents and principles. The\r\nvarious kingdoms which composed this empire, once independent, yielded to\r\nthe conquerors who reigned at Babylon, or Nineveh, or Persepolis, and\r\nformed satrapies paying tribute to the great king. The satraps of Cyrus\r\nwere like the satraps of Nebuchadnezzar, members or friends of the\r\nimperial house, who ruled the various provinces in the name of the king of\r\nBabylon, or Persia, without much interference with the manners, or\r\nlanguage, or customs, or laws, or religion of the conquered, contented to\r\nreceive tribute merely, and troops in case of war. And so great was the\r\naccumulation of treasure in the various royal cities where the king\r\nresided part of the year, that Darius left behind him on his flight, in\r\nEcbatana alone, one hundred and eighty thousand talents, or two hundred\r\nmillion dollars. It was by this treasure that the kings of Persia lived in\r\nsuch royal magnificence, and with it they were able to subsidize armies to\r\nmaintain their power throughout their vast dominions, and even gain allies\r\nlike the Greeks, when they had need of their services. Their treasures\r\nwere inexhaustible—and were accumulated with the purpose of maintaining\r\nempire, and hence were not spent, but remained as a sacred deposit.\r\n\r\n(M728) It was to overthrow this empire that Philip aspired, after he had\r\nconquered Greece, in part to revenge the injuries inflicted by the Persian\r\ninvasions, but more from personal ambition. And had he lived, he would\r\nhave succeeded, and his name would have been handed down as the great\r\nconqueror, rather than that of his more fortunate son. Philip knew what a\r\nrope of sand the Persian military power was. Xenophon had enlightened the\r\nGreeks as to the inefficiency of the Persian armies, if they needed any\r\nadditional instruction after the defeat of Xerxes and his generals. The\r\nvast armies of the Persians made a grand show, and looked formidable when\r\nreviewed by the king in his gilded chariot, surrounded by his nobles, the\r\nprinces of his family, and the women of his harem. And these armies were\r\nsufficient to keep the empire together. The mighty prestige attending\r\nvictories for one thousand years, and all the pomp of millions in battle\r\narray, was adequate to keep the province together, for the system of\r\nwarfare and the character of the forces were similar in all the provinces.\r\nIt was external enemies, with a different system of warfare, that the\r\nPersian kings had to dread—not the revolt of enervated States, and\r\nunwarlike cities. The Orientals were never warlike in the sense that\r\nGreece and Rome were. The armies of Greece and Rome were small, but\r\nefficient. It was seldom that any Grecian or Roman army exceeded fifty\r\nthousand men, but they were veterans, and they had military science and\r\nskill and discipline. The hosts of Xerxes or Darius were undisciplined,\r\nand they were mercenaries, unlike the original troops of Cyrus.\r\n\r\n(M729) Now it was the mission of Alexander to overturn the dynasties which\r\nreigned so ingloriously on the banks of the Euphrates—to overrun the\r\nPersian empire from north to south and east to west—to cut it up, and form\r\nnew kingdoms of the dismembered provinces, and distribute the hoarded\r\ntreasures of Susa, Persepolis, and Ecbatana—to introduce Greek satraps\r\ninstead of Persian—to favor the spread of the Greek language and\r\ninstitutions—to found new cities where Greeks might reign, from which they\r\nmight diffuse their spirit and culture. Alexander spent only one year of\r\nhis reign in Greece, all the rest of his life was spent in the various\r\nprovinces of Persia. He was the conqueror of the Oriental world. He had no\r\nhard battles to fight, like Cæsar or Napoleon. All he had to do was to\r\nappear with his troops, and the enemy fled. Cities were surrendered as he\r\napproached. The two great battles which decided the fate of Persia—Issus\r\nand Arbela—were gained at the first shock of his cavalry. Darius fled from\r\nthe field, in both instances, at the very beginning of the battle, and\r\nmade no real resistance. The greater the number of Persian soldiers, the\r\nmore disorderly was the rout. The Macedonian soldiers fought retreating\r\narmies in headlong flight. The slaughter of the Persians was mere\r\nbutchery. It was something like collecting a vast number of birds in a\r\nsmall space, and shooting them when collected in a corner, and dignifying\r\nthe slaughter with a grand name—not like chasing the deer over rocks and\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n(M730) The military genius of Alexander was seen in the siege of the few\r\ntowns which _did_ resist, like Tyre and Gaza; in his rapid marches; in the\r\ncombination of his forces; in the system, foresight, and sagacity he\r\ndisplayed, conquering at the light time, marching upon the right place,\r\nhusbanding his energies, wasting no time in expeditions which did not bear\r\non the main issue, and concentrating his men on points which were vital\r\nand important. Philip, if he had lived, might have conquered the Persian\r\nempire; but he would not have conquered so rapidly as Alexander, who knew\r\nno rest, and advanced from conquering to conquer, in some cases without\r\nulterior objects, as in the Indian campaigns—simply from the love and\r\nexcitement of conquest. He only needed time. He met no enemies who could\r\noppose him—more, I apprehend, from the want of discipline among his\r\nenemies, than from any irresistible strength of his soldiers, for he\r\nembodied the conquered soldiers in his own army, and they fought like his\r\nown troops, when once disciplined. Nor did he dream of reconstruction, or\r\nbuilding up a great central power. He would, if he had lived, have overrun\r\nArabia, and then Italy, and Gaul. But he did not live to measure his\r\nstrength with the Romans. His mission was ended when he had subdued the\r\nPersian world. And he left no successor. His empire was divided among his\r\ngenerals, and new kingdoms arose on the ruins of the Persian empire.\r\n\r\n(M731) “Alexander was born B.C. 356, and like his father, Philip, was not\r\nGreek, but a Macedonian and Epirot, only partially imbued with Grecian\r\nsentiment and intelligence.” He inherited the ambition of Philip, and the\r\nviolent and headstrong temperament of his furious mother, Olympias. His\r\neducation was good, and he was instructed by his Greek tutors in the\r\nlearning common to Grecian princes. His taste inclined him to poetry and\r\nliterature, rather than to science and philosophy. At thirteen he was\r\nintrusted to the care of the great Aristotle, and remained under his\r\nteaching three years. At sixteen he was left regent of the Macedonian\r\nkingdom, whose capital was Pella, while his father was absent in the siege\r\nof Byzantium. At eighteen he commanded one of the wings of the army at the\r\nbattle of Chæronea. His prospects were uncertain up to the very day when\r\nPhilip was assassinated, on account of family dissensions, and the wrath\r\nof his father, whom he had displeased. But he was proclaimed king on the\r\ndeath of Philip, B.C., 336 and celebrated his funeral with great\r\nmagnificence, and slew many of his murderers. The death of Philip had\r\nexcited aspirations of freedom in the Grecian States, but there was no\r\ncombination to throw off the Macedonian yoke. Alexander well understood\r\nthe discontent of Greece, and his first object was to bring it to abject\r\nsubmission. With the army of his father he marched from State to State,\r\ncompelling submission, and punishing with unscrupulous cruelty all who\r\nresisted. After displaying his forces in various portions of the\r\nPeloponnesus, he repaired to Corinth and convened the deputies from the\r\nGrecian cities, and was chosen to the headship of Greece, as his father,\r\nPhilip, had been. He was appointed the keeper of the peace of Greece. Each\r\nHellenic city was declared free, and in each the existing institutions\r\nwere recognized, but no new despot was to be established, and each city\r\nwas forbidden to send armed vessels to the harbor of any other, or build\r\nvessels, or engage seamen there. Such was the melancholy degradation of\r\nthe Grecian world. Its freedom was extinguished, and there was no hope of\r\nescaping the despotism of Macedonia, but by invoking aid from the Persian\r\nking. Had he been wise, he would have subsidized the Greeks with a part of\r\nhis vast treasures, and raised a force in Greece able to cope with\r\nAlexander. But he was doomed, and the Macedonian king was left free to\r\ncomplete the conquest of all the States. He first marched across Mount\r\nHæmus, and subdued the Illyrians, Pæonians, and Thracians. He even crossed\r\nthe Danube, and defeated the Gætæ.\r\n\r\n(M732) Just as he had completed the conquest of the barbarians north of\r\nMacedonia, he heard that the Thebans had declared their independence,\r\nbeing encouraged by his long absence in Thrace, and by reports of his\r\ndeath. But he suddenly appeared with his victorious army, and as the\r\nThebans had no generals equal to Pelopidas and Epaminondas, they were\r\neasily subdued. Thebes was taken by assault, and the population was\r\nmassacred—even women and children, whether in their houses or in temples.\r\nThirty thousand captives were reserved for sale. The city was razed to the\r\nground, and the Cadmea alone was preserved for a Macedonian garrison. The\r\nTheban territory was partitioned among the reconstructed cities of\r\nOrchomenus and Platæa. This severity was unparalleled in the history of\r\nGreece, but the remorseless conqueror wished to strike with terror all\r\nother cities, and prevent rebellion. He produced the effect he desired.\r\nAll the cities of Greece hastened to make peace with so terrible an enemy.\r\nHe threatened a like doom on Athens because she refused to surrender the\r\nanti-Macedonian leaders, including Demosthenes, but was finally appeased\r\nthrough the influence of Phocion, since he did not wish to drive Athens to\r\ndesperate courses, which might have impeded his contemplated conquest of\r\nPersia, for the city was still strong in naval defenses, and might unite\r\nwith the Persian king. So Athens was spared, but the empire of Thebes was\r\nutterly destroyed. He then repaired to Corinth to make arrangements for\r\nhis Persian campaign, and while in that city he visited the cynical\r\nphilosopher, Diogenes, who lived in a tub. It is said that when the\r\nphilosopher was asked by Alexander if he wished any thing, he replied:\r\n“Nothing, except that you would stand a little out of my sunshine”—a reply\r\nwhich extorted from the conqueror the remark: “If I were not Alexander, I\r\nwould be Diogenes.”\r\n\r\n(M733) It took Alexander a year and a few months to crush out what little\r\nremained of Grecian freedom, subdue the Thracians, and collect forces for\r\nhis expedition into Persia. In the spring of 334 B.C., his army was\r\nmustered between Pella and Amphipolis, while his fleet was at hand to\r\nrender assistance. In April he crossed the strait from Sestos to Abydos,\r\nand never returned to his own capital—Pella—or to Europe. The remainder of\r\nhis life, eleven years and two months, was spent in Asia, in continued and\r\nincreasing conquests; and these were on such a gigantic scale that Greece\r\ndwindled into insignificance.\r\n\r\n(M734) When marshalled on the Asiatic shore, the army of Alexander\r\npresented a total of thirty thousand infantry, and four thousand five\r\nhundred cavalry—a small force, apparently, to overthrow the most venerable\r\nand extensive empire in the world. But these troops were veterans, trained\r\nby Philip, and commanded by able generals. Of these troops twelve thousand\r\nwere Macedonians, armed with the sarissa, a long pike, which made the\r\nphalanx, sixteen deep, so formidable. The sarissa was twenty-one feet in\r\nlength, and so held by both hands as to project fifteen feet before the\r\nbody of the pikeman. The soldier of the phalanx was also provided with a\r\nshort sword, a circular shield, a breastplate, leggings, and broad-brimmed\r\nhat. But, besides the phalanx of heavy armed men, there were hoplites\r\nlightly armed, hypaspists for the assault of walled places, and troops\r\nwith javelins and with bows. The cavalry was admirable, distributed into\r\nsquadrons, among whom were the body-guards—all promoted out of royal pages\r\nand the picked men of the army, sons of the chief people in Macedonia, and\r\nthese were heavily armed.\r\n\r\n(M735) The generals who served under Alexander were all Macedonians, and\r\nhad been trained by Philip. Among these were Hephæstion, the intimate\r\npersonal friend of Alexander, Ptolemy, Perdiccas, Antipater, Clitus,\r\nParmenio, Philotas, Nicanor, Seleucus, Amyntas, Phillipes, Lysimachus,\r\nAntigonas, most of whom reached great power. Parmenio and Antipater were\r\nthe highest in rank, the latter of whom was left as viceroy of Macedonia,\r\nEumenes was the private secretary of Alexander, the most long-headed man\r\nin his army.\r\n\r\n(M736) Alexander had landed, unopposed, against the advice of Memnon and\r\nMentor—two Rhodians, in the service of Darius, the king—descendants of one\r\nof the brothers of Artaxerxes Mnemon—the children of King Ochus, after his\r\nassassination, having all been murdered by the eunuch Bagoas. As the\r\nPersians were superior by sea to the Macedonians, it was an imprudence to\r\nallow Alexander to cross the Hellespont without opposition; but Memnon was\r\noverruled by the Persian satraps, who supposed that they were more than a\r\nmatch for Alexander on the land, and hoped to defeat him. Arsites, the\r\nPhrygian satrap, commanded the Persian forces, assisted by other satraps,\r\nand Persians of high rank, among whom were Spithridates, satrap of Lydia\r\nand Ionia. The cavalry of the Persians greatly outnumbered that of the\r\nMacedonians, but the infantry was inferior. Memnon advised the satraps to\r\navoid fighting on the land, and to employ the fleet for aggressive\r\nmovements in Macedonia and Greece, but Arsites rejected his advice. The\r\nPersians took post on the river Granicus, near the town of Parium, on one\r\nof the declivities of Mount Ida. Alexander at once resolved to force the\r\npassage of the river, taking the command of the right wing, and giving the\r\nleft to Parmenio. The battle was fought by the cavalry, in which Alexander\r\nshowed great personal courage. At one time he was in imminent danger of\r\nhis life, from the cimeter of Spithridates, but Clitus saved him by\r\nsevering the uplifted arm of the satrap from his body with his sword. The\r\nvictory was complete, and great numbers of the satraps were slain. There\r\nremained no force in Asia Minor to resist the conqueror, and the Asiatics\r\nsubmitted in terror and alarm. Alexander then sent Parmenio to subdue\r\nDascyleum, the stronghold of the satrap of Phrygia, while he advanced to\r\nSardis, the capital of Lydia, and the main station of the Persians in Asia\r\nMinor. The citadel was considered impregnable, yet such was the terror of\r\nthe Persians, that both city and citadel surrendered without a blow.\r\nPhrygia and Lydia then fell into his hands, with immense treasure, of\r\nwhich he stood in need. He then marched to Ephesus, and entered the city\r\nwithout resistance, and thus was placed in communication with his fleet,\r\nunder the command of Nicanor. He found no opposition until he reached\r\nMiletus, which was encouraged to resist him from the approach of the\r\nPersian fleet, four hundred sail, chiefly of Phœnician and Cyprian ships,\r\nwhich, a few weeks earlier, might have prevented his crossing into Asia.\r\nBut the Persian fleet did not arrive until the city was invested, and the\r\nMacedonian fleet, of one hundred and sixty sail, had occupied the harbor.\r\nAlexander declined to fight on the sea, but pressed the siege on the land,\r\nso that the Persian fleet, unable to render assistance, withdrew to\r\nHalicarnassus. The city fell, and Alexander took the resolution of\r\ndisbanding his own fleet altogether, and concentrating all his operations\r\non the land—doubtless a wise, but desperate measure. He supposed, and\r\nrightly, that after he had taken the cities on the coast, the Persian\r\nfleet would be useless, and the country would be insured to his army.\r\n\r\n(M737) Alexander found some difficulty at the siege of Halicarnassus, from\r\nthe bravery of the garrison, commanded by Memnon, and the strength of the\r\ndefenses, aided by the Persian fleet. But his soldiers, “protected from\r\nmissiles by movable pent-houses, called tortoises, gradually filled up the\r\ndeep and wide ditch round the town, so as to open a level road for his\r\nengines (rolling towers of wood) to come up close to the walls.” Then the\r\nbattering-rams overthrew the towers of the city wall, and made a breach in\r\nthem, so that the city was taken by assault. Memnon, forced to abandon his\r\ndefenses, withdrew the garrison by sea, and Alexander entered the city.\r\nThe ensuing winter months were employed in the conquest of Lydia,\r\nPamphylia, and Pisidia, which was effected easily, since the terror of his\r\narms led to submission wherever he appeared. At Gordium, in Phrygia, he\r\nperformed the exploit familiarly known as the cutting of the Gordian knot,\r\nwhich was a cord so twisted and entangled, that no one could untie it. The\r\noracle had pronounced that to the person who should untie it, the empire\r\nof Persia was destined. Alexander, after many futile attempts to\r\ndisentangle the knot, in a fit of impatience, cut it with his sword, and\r\nthis was accepted as the solution of the problem.\r\n\r\n(M738) Meanwhile Memnon, to whom Darius had intrusted the guardianship of\r\nthe whole coast of Asia Minor, with a large Phœnician fleet and a\r\nconsiderable body of Grecian mercenaries, acquired the important island of\r\nChios, and a large part of Lesbos. But in the midst of his successes, he\r\ndied of sickness, and no one was left able to take his place. Had his\r\nadvice been taken, Alexander could not have landed in Asia. His death was\r\nan irreparable loss to Persian cause, and with his death vanished all hope\r\nof employing the Persian force with wisdom and effect. Darius now changed\r\nhis policy, and resolved to carry on offensive measures on the land. He\r\ntherefore summoned a vast army, from all parts of his empire, of five\r\nhundred thousand infantry, and one hundred thousand cavalry. An eminent\r\nAthenian, Charidemus, advised the Persian king to employ his great\r\ntreasure in subsidizing the Greeks, and not to dream, with his\r\nundisciplined Asiatics, to oppose the Macedonians in battle. But the\r\nadvice was so unpalatable to the proud and self-reliant king, in the midst\r\nof his vast forces, that he looked upon Charidemus as a traitor, and sent\r\nhim to execution.\r\n\r\n(M739) It would not have been difficult for Darius to defend his kingdom,\r\nhad he properly guarded the mountain passes through which Alexander must\r\nneeds march to invade Persia. Here again Darius was infatuated, and he, in\r\nhis self-confidence, left the passes over Mount Taurus and Mount Amanus\r\nundefended. Alexander, with re-enforcements from Macedonia, now marched\r\nfrom Gordium through Paphlagonia and Cappadocia, whose inhabitants made\r\ninstant submission, and advanced to the Cilician Gates—an impregnable pass\r\nin the Taurus range, which opened the way to Cilicia. It had been\r\ntraversed seventy years before by Cyrus the Younger, with the ten thousand\r\nGreeks, and was the main road from Asia Minor into Cilicia and Syria. The\r\nnarrowest part of this defile allowed only four soldiers abreast, and here\r\nDarius should have taken his stand, even as the Greeks took possession of\r\nThermopylæ in the invasion of Xerxes. But the pass was utterly undefended,\r\nand Alexander marched through unobstructed without the loss of a man. He\r\nthen found himself at Tarsus, where he made a long halt, from a dangerous\r\nillness which he got by bathing in the river Cydnus. When he recovered, he\r\nsent Parmenio to secure the pass over Mount Amanus, six days’ march from\r\nTarsus, called the Cilician Gates. These were defended, but the guard fled\r\nat the approach of the Macedonians, and this important defile was secured.\r\nAlexander then marched through Issus to Myriandrus, to the south of the\r\nCilician Gates, which he had passed. The Persians now advanced from Sochi\r\nand appeared in his rear at Issus—a vast host, in the midst of which was\r\nDarius with his mother, his wife, his harem, and children, who accompanied\r\nhim to witness his anticipated triumph, for it seemed to him an easy\r\nmatter to overwhelm and crush the invaders, who numbered only about forty\r\nthousand men. So impatient was Darius to attack Alexander that he\r\nimprudently advanced into Cilicia by the northern pass, now called Beylan,\r\nwith all his army, so that in the narrow defiles of that country his\r\ncavalry was nearly useless. He encamped near Issus, on the river Pinarus.\r\nAlexander, learning that Darius was in his rear, retraced his steps,\r\npassed north through the Gates of Cilicia, through which he had marched\r\ntwo days before, and advanced to the river Pinarus, on the north bank of\r\nwhich Darius was encamped. And here Darius resolved to fight. He threw\r\nacross the river thirty thousand cavalry and twenty thousand infantry, to\r\ninsure the undisturbed formation of his main force. His main line was\r\ncomposed of ninety thousand hoplites, of which thirty thousand were Greek\r\nin the centre. On the mountain to his left, he posted twenty thousand, to\r\nact against the right wing of the Macedonian army. He then recalled the\r\nthirty thousand cavalry and twenty thousand infantry, which he had sent\r\nacross the river, and awaited the onset of Alexander, Darius was in his\r\nchariot, in the centre, behind the Grecian hoplites. But the ground was so\r\nuneven, that only a part of his army could fight. A large proportion of it\r\nwere mere spectators.\r\n\r\n(M740) Alexander advanced to the attack. The left-wing was commanded by\r\nParmenio, and the right by himself, on which were placed the Macedonian\r\ncavalry. The divisions of the phalanx were in the centre, and the\r\nPeloponnesian cavalry and Thracian light infantry on the left. The whole\r\nfront extended only one and a half mile. Crossing the river rapidly,\r\nAlexander, at the head of his cavalry, light infantry, and some divisions\r\nof the phalanx, fell suddenly upon the Asiatic hoplites which were\r\nstationed on the Persian left. So impetuous and unexpected was the charge,\r\nthat the troops instantly fled, vigorously pressed by the Macedonian\r\nright. Darius, from his chariot, saw the flight of his left wing, and,\r\nseized with sudden panic, caused his chariot to be turned, and fled also\r\namong the foremost fugitives. In his terror he cast away his bow, shield,\r\nand regal mantle. He did not give a single order, nor did he remain a\r\nmoment after the defeat of his left, as he ought, for he was behind thirty\r\nthousand Grecian hoplites, in the centre, but abandoned himself to\r\ninglorious flight, and this was the signal for a general flight also of\r\nall his troops, who turned and trampled each other down in their efforts\r\nto get beyond the reach of the enemy.\r\n\r\n(M741) Thus the battle was lost by the giving way of the Asiatic hoplites\r\non the left, and the flight of Darius in a few minutes after. The Persian\r\nright showed some bravery, till Alexander, having completed the rout of\r\nthe left, turned to attack the Grecian mercenaries in the flank and rear,\r\nwhen all fled in terror. The slaughter of the fugitives was prodigious.\r\nThe camp of Darius was taken, with his mother, wife, sister, and children.\r\nOne hundred thousand Persians were slain, not in _fight_, but in _flight_,\r\nand among them were several eminent satraps and grandees. The Persian\r\nhosts were completely dispersed, and Darius did not stop till he had\r\ncrossed the Euphrates. The booty acquired was immense, in gold, silver,\r\nand captives.\r\n\r\n(M742) Such was the decisive battle of Issus, where the cowardice and\r\nincompetency of Darius were more marked than the generalship of Alexander\r\nhimself. No victory was ever followed by more important consequences. It\r\ndispersed the Persian hosts, and opened Persia to a victorious enemy, and\r\ngave an irresistible prestige to the conqueror. The fall of the empire was\r\nrendered probable, and insured successive triumphs to Alexander.\r\n\r\n(M743) But before he proceeded to the complete conquest of the Persian\r\nempire, Alexander, like a prudent and far-reaching general, impetuous as\r\nhe was, concluded to subdue first all the provinces which lay on the\r\ncoast, and thus make the Persian fleet useless, and ultimately capture it,\r\nand leave his rear without an enemy. Accordingly he sent Parmenio to\r\ncapture Damascus, where were collected immense treasures. It was\r\nsurrendered without resistance though it was capable of sustaining a\r\nsiege. There were captured vast treasures, with prodigious numbers of\r\nPersians of high rank, and many illustrious Greek exiles. Master of\r\nDamascus, Alexander, in the winter of B.C. 331, advanced upon Phœnicia,\r\nthe cities of which mostly sent letters of submission. While at Maranthus,\r\nDarius wrote to Alexander, asking for the restitution of his wife, mother,\r\nsister, and daughter, and tendering friendship, to which Alexander replied\r\nin a haughty letter, demanding to be addressed, not as an equal, but as\r\nlord of Asia.\r\n\r\n(M744) The last hope of Darius was in the Phœnicians, who furnished him\r\nships; and one city remained firm in its allegiance—Tyre—the strongest and\r\nmost important place in Phœnicia. But even this city would have yielded on\r\nfair and honorable conditions. This did not accord with Alexander’s views,\r\nwho made exorbitant demands, which could not be accepted by the Tyrians\r\nwithout hazarding their all. Accordingly they prepared for a siege,\r\ntrusting to the impregnable defenses of the city. It was situated on an\r\nislet, half a mile from the main land, surrounded by lofty walls and\r\ntowers of immense strength and thickness. But nothing discouraged\r\nAlexander, who loved to surmount difficulties. He constructed a mole from\r\nthe main land to the islet, two hundred feet wide, of stone and timber,\r\nwhich was destroyed by a storm and by the efforts of the Tyrians. Nothing\r\ndaunted, he built another, still wider and stronger, and repaired to\r\nSidon, where he collected a great fleet, with which he invested the city\r\nby sea, as well as land. The doom of the city was now sealed, and the\r\nTyrians could offer no more serious obstructions. The engines were then\r\nrolled along the mole to the walls, and a breach was at last made, and the\r\ncity was taken by assault. The citizens then barricaded the streets, and\r\nfought desperately until they were slain. The surviving soldiers were\r\nhanged, and the women and children sold as slaves. Still the city resisted\r\nfor seven months, and its capture was really the greatest effort of genius\r\nthat Alexander had shown, and furnished an example to Richelieu in the\r\nsiege of La Rochelle.\r\n\r\n(M745) On the fall of this ancient and wealthy capital, whose pride and\r\nwealth are spoken of in the Scriptures, Alexander received a second letter\r\nfrom Darius, offering ten thousand talents, his daughter in marriage, with\r\nthe cession of all the provinces of his empire west of the Euphrates, for\r\nthe surrender of his family. To which the haughty and insolent conqueror\r\nreplied: “I want neither your money nor your cession. All your money and\r\nterritory are mine already, and you are tendering me a part instead of the\r\nwhole. If I choose to marry your daughter I _shall_ marry her, whether you\r\ngive her to me or not. Come hither to me, if you wish for friendship.”\r\n\r\n(M746) Darius now saw that he must risk another desperate battle, and\r\nsummoned all his hosts. Yet Alexander did not immediately march against\r\nhim, but undertook first the conquest of Egypt. Syria, Phœnicia, and\r\nPalestine were now his, as well as Asia Minor. He had also defeated the\r\nPersian fleet, and was master of all the islands of the Ægean. He stopped\r\non his way to Egypt to take Gaza, which held out against him, built on a\r\nlofty artificial mound two hundred and fifty feet high, and encircled with\r\na lofty wall. The Macedonian engineers pronounced the place impregnable,\r\nbut the greater the difficulty the greater the eagerness of Alexander to\r\nsurmount it. He accordingly built a mound all around the city, as high as\r\nthat on which Gaza was built, and then rolled his engines to the wall,\r\neffected a breach, and stormed the city, slew all the garrison, and sold\r\nall the women and children for slaves. As for Batis, the defender of the\r\ncity, he was dragged by a chariot around the town, as Achilles, whom\r\nAlexander imitated, had done to the dead body of Hector. The siege of\r\nthese two cities, Tyre and Gaza, occupied nine months, and was the hardest\r\nfighting that Alexander ever encountered.\r\n\r\n(M747) He entered and occupied Egypt without resistance, and resolved to\r\nfound a new city, near the mouth of the Nile, not as a future capital of\r\nthe commercial world, but as a depot for his ships. While he was preparing\r\nfor this great work, he visited the temple of Jupiter Ammon in the desert,\r\nand was addressed by the priests as the Son of God, not as a mortal, which\r\nflattery was agreeable to him, so that ever afterward he claimed divinity,\r\nin the arrogance of his character, and the splendor of his successes, and\r\neven slew the man who saved his life at the Granicus, because he denied\r\nhis divine claims—the most signal instance of self-exaggeration and pride\r\nrecorded in history, transcending both Nebuchadnezzar and Napoleon.\r\n\r\n(M748) After arranging his affairs in Egypt, and obtaining re-enforcements\r\nof Greeks and Thracians, he set out for the Euphrates, which he crossed at\r\nThapsacus, unobstructed—another error of the Persians. But Darius was\r\nparalyzed by the greatness of his misfortunes, and by the capture of his\r\nfamily, and could not act with energy or wisdom. He collected his vast\r\nhosts on a plain near Arbela, east of the Tigris, and waited for the\r\napproach of the enemy. He had one million of infantry, forty thousand\r\ncavalry, and two hundred scythed chariots, besides a number of elephants.\r\nHe placed himself in the centre, with his choice troops, including the\r\nhorse and foot-guards, and mercenary Greeks. In the rear stood deep masses\r\nof Babylonians, and on the left, and right, Bactrians, Cadusians, Medes,\r\nAlbanians, and troops from the remote provinces. In the front of Darius,\r\nwere the scythed chariots with advanced bodies of cavalry.\r\n\r\n(M749) Alexander, as he approached, ranged his forces with great care and\r\nskill, forty thousand foot and seven thousand horse. His main line was\r\ncomposed, on the right, of choice cavalry; then, toward the left, of\r\nhypaspists; then the phalanx, in six divisions, which formed the centre;\r\nthen Greek cavalry on the extreme left. Behind the main line was a body of\r\nreserves, intended to guard against attack on the flanks and rear. In\r\nfront of the main line were advanced squadrons of cavalry and light\r\ntroops. The Thracian infantry guarded the baggage and camp. He himself\r\ncommanded the right, and Parmenio the left.\r\n\r\n(M750) Darius, at the commencement of the attack, ordered his chariots to\r\ncharge, and the main line to follow, calculating on disorder. But the\r\nhorses of the chariots were terrified and wounded by the Grecian archers\r\nand darters in front, and most turned round, or were stopped. Those that\r\npressed on were let through the Macedonian lines without mischief. As at\r\nIssus, Alexander did not attack the centre, where Darius was surrounded\r\nwith the choicest troops of the army, but advanced impetuously upon the\r\nleft wing, turned it, and advanced by a flank movement toward the centre,\r\nwhere Darius was posted. The Persian king, seeing the failure of the\r\nchariots, and the advancing troops of Alexander, lost his self-possession,\r\nturned his chariot, and fled, as at Issus. Such folly and cowardice led,\r\nof course, to instant defeat and rout; and nothing was left for the\r\nvictor, but to pursue and destroy the disorderly fugitives, so that the\r\nslaughter was immense. But while the left and centre of the Persians were\r\nput to flight, the right fought vigorously, and might have changed the\r\nfortune of the day, had not Alexander seasonably returned from the\r\npursuit, and attacked the left in the rear and flank. Then all was lost,\r\nand headlong flight marked the Persian hosts. The battle was lost by the\r\ncowardice of Darius, who insisted, with strange presumption, on commanding\r\nin person. Half the troops, under an able general, would have overwhelmed\r\nthe Macedonian army, even with Alexander at the head. But the Persians had\r\nno leader of courage and skill, and were a mere rabble. According to some\r\naccounts, three hundred thousand Persians were slain, and not more than\r\none hundred Macedonians. There was no attempt on the part of Darius to\r\nrally or collect a new army. His cause and throne were irretrievably lost,\r\nand he was obliged to fly to his farthest provinces, pursued by the\r\nconqueror. The battle of Arbela was the death-blow to the Persian empire.\r\nWe can not help feeling sentiments of indignation in view of such wretched\r\nmanagement on the part of the Persians, thus throwing away an empire. But,\r\non the other hand, we are also compelled to admit the extraordinary\r\ngeneralship of Alexander, who brought into action every part of his army,\r\nwhile at least three-quarters of the Persians were mere spectators, so\r\nthat his available force was really great. His sagacious combinations, his\r\nperception of the weak points of his adversary, and the instant advantage\r\nwhich he seized—his insight, rapidity of movement, and splendid\r\norganization, made him irresistible against any Persian array of numbers,\r\nwithout skill. Indeed, the Persian army was too large, since it could not\r\nbe commanded by one man with any effect, and all became confusion and ruin\r\non the first misfortune. The great generals of antiquity, Greek and Roman,\r\nrarely commanded over fifty thousand men on the field of battle; and fifty\r\nthousand, under Alexander’s circumstances, were more effective, perhaps,\r\nthan two hundred thousand. In modern times, when battles are not decided\r\nby personal bravery, but by the number and disposition of cannon, and the\r\nexcellence of firearms, an army of one hundred thousand can generally\r\noverwhelm an army of fifty thousand, with the same destructive weapons.\r\nBut in ancient times, the impetuous charge of twenty thousand men on a\r\nsingle point, followed by success, would produce a panic, and then a rout,\r\nwhen even flight is obstructed by numbers. Thus Alexander succeeded both\r\nat Issus and Arbela. He concentrated forces upon a weak point, which, when\r\ncarried, produced a panic, and especially sent dismay into the mind of\r\nDarius, who had no nerve or self-control. Had he remained firm, and only\r\nfought on the defensive, the Macedonians might not have prevailed. But he\r\nfled; and confusion seized, of course, his hosts.\r\n\r\n(M751) Both Babylon and Susa, the two great capitals of the empire,\r\nimmediately surrendered after the decisive battle of Arbela, and Alexander\r\nbecame the great king and Darius a fugitive. The treasure found at Susa\r\nwas even greater than that which Babylon furnished—about fifty thousand\r\ntalents, or fifty million dollars, one-fifth of which, three years before,\r\nwould have been sufficient to subsidize Greece, and present a barrier to\r\nthe conquests of both Philip and Alexander.\r\n\r\n(M752) The victor spent a month in Babylon, sacrificing to the Babylonian\r\ndeities, feasting his troops, and organizing his new empire. He then\r\nmarched into Persia proper, subdued the inhabitants, and entered\r\nPersepolis. Though it was the strongest place in the empire, it made no\r\nresistance. Here were hoarded the chief treasures of the Persian kings, no\r\nless than one hundred and twenty thousand talents, or about one hundred\r\nand twenty million dollars of our money—an immense sum in gold and silver\r\nin that age, a tenth of which, judiciously spent, would have secured the\r\nthrone to Darius against any exterior enemy. He was now a fugitive in\r\nMedia, and thither Alexander went at once in pursuit, giving himself no\r\nrest. He established himself at Ecbatana, the capital, without resistance,\r\nand made preparations for the invasion of the eastern part of the Persian\r\nempire, beyond the Parthian desert, even to the Oxus and the Indus,\r\ninhabited by warlike barbarians, from which were chiefly recruited the\r\nPersian armies.\r\n\r\n(M753) It would be tedious to describe the successive conquests of\r\nSogdiana, Margiana, Bactriana, and even some territory beyond the Indus.\r\nAlexander never met from these nations the resistance which Cæsar found in\r\nGaul, nor were his battles in these eastern countries remarkable. He only\r\nhad to appear, and he was master. At last his troops were wearied of these\r\ncontinual marchings and easy victories, when their real enemies were heat,\r\nhunger, thirst, fatigue, and toil. They refused to follow their general\r\nand king any further to the east, and he was obliged to return. Yet some\r\nseven years were consumed in marches and conquests in these remote\r\ncountries, for he penetrated to Scythia at the north, and the mouth of the\r\nIndus to the south.\r\n\r\n(M754) It was in the expeditions among these barbarians that some of the\r\nmost disgraceful events of his life took place. He seldom rested, but when\r\nhe had leisure he indulged in great excesses at the festive board. His\r\nrevelries with his officers were prolonged often during the night, and\r\nwhen intoxicated, he did things which gave him afterward the deepest\r\nremorse and shame. Thus he killed, with his own hand, Clitus, at a feast,\r\nbecause Clitus ventured to utter some truths which were in opposition to\r\nhis notions of omnipotence. But the agony of remorse was so great, that he\r\nremained in bed three whole days and nights immediately after, refusing\r\nall food and drink. He also killed Philotas, one of his most trusted\r\ngenerals, and commander of his body-guard, on suspicion of treachery, and\r\nthen, without other cause than fear of the anger of his father, Parmenio,\r\nhe caused that old general to be assassinated at Ecbatana, in command of\r\nthe post—the most important in his dominions—where his treasures were\r\ndeposited. He savagely mutilated Bessus, the satrap, who stood out against\r\nhim in Bactria. Callisthenes, one of the greatest philosophers of the age,\r\nwas tortured and assassinated for alleged complexity in a conspiracy, but\r\nhe really incurred the hatred of the monarch for denying his claim to\r\ndivinity.\r\n\r\n(M755) In the spring of B.C. 326, Alexander crossed the Indus, but met\r\nwith no resistance until he reached the river Hydaspes (Jhylum) on the\r\nother side of which, Porus, an Indian prince, disputed his passage, with a\r\nformidable force and many trained elephants—animals which the Macedonians\r\nhad never before encountered. By a series of masterly combinations\r\nAlexander succeeded in crossing the river, and the combat commenced. But\r\nthe Indians could not long withstand the long pikes and close combats of\r\nthe Greeks, and were defeated with great loss. Porus himself, a prince of\r\ngigantic stature, mounted on an elephant, was taken, after having fought\r\nwith great courage. Carried into the presence of the conqueror, Alexander\r\nasked him what, he wished to be done for him, for his gallantry and\r\nphysical strength excited admiration. Porus replied that he wished to be\r\ntreated as a king, which answer still more excited the admiration of the\r\nGreeks. He was accordingly treated with the utmost courtesy and\r\ngenerosity, and retained as an ally. Alexander was capable of great\r\nmagnanimity, when he was not opposed. He was kind to the family of Darius,\r\nboth before and after his assassination by the satrap Bessus. And his\r\nmunificence to his soldiers was great, and he never lost their affections.\r\nBut he was cruel and sanguinary in his treatment of captives who had made\r\nhim trouble, putting thousands to the sword in cold blood.\r\n\r\n(M756) As before mentioned, the soldiers were wearied with victories and\r\nhardships, without enjoyments, and longed to return to Europe. Hence\r\nSangala, in India, was the easternmost point to which he penetrated. On\r\nreturning to the river Hydaspes, he constructed a fleet of two thousand\r\nboats, in which a part of his army descended the river with himself, while\r\nanother part marched along its banks. He sailed slowly down the river to\r\nits junction with the Indus, and then to the Indian ocean. This voyage\r\noccupied nine months, but most of the time was employed in subduing the\r\nvarious people who opposed his march. On reaching the ocean, he was\r\nastonished and interested by the ebbing and flowing of the tide—a new\r\nphenomenon to him. The fleet was conducted from the mouth of the Indus,\r\nround by the Persian Gulf to the mouth of the Tigris—a great nautical\r\nachievement in those days; but he himself, with the army, marched westward\r\nthrough deserts, undergoing great fatigues and sufferings, and with a\r\ngreat loss of men, horses, and baggage. At Carmania he halted, and the\r\narmy for seven days was abandoned to drunken festivities.\r\n\r\n(M757) On returning to Persepolis, in Persia, he visited and repaired the\r\ntomb of Cyrus, the greatest conqueror the world had seen before himself.\r\nIn February, B.C. 324, he marched to Susa, where he spent several months\r\nin festivities and in organizing his great government, since he no longer\r\nhad armies to oppose. He now surrounded himself with the pomp of the\r\nPersian kings, wore their dress, and affected their habits, much to the\r\ndisgust of his Macedonian generals. He had married a beautiful\r\ncaptive—Roxana, in Bactria, and he now took two additional wives, Statira,\r\ndaughter of Darius, and Parysatis, daughter of King Ochus. He also caused\r\nhis principal officers to marry the daughters of the old Persian grandees,\r\nand seemed to forget the country from which he came, and which he was\r\ndestined never again to see. Here also he gave a donation to his soldiers\r\nof twenty thousand talents—about five hundred dollars to each man. But\r\neven this did not satisfy them, and when new re-enforcements arrived, the\r\nold soldiers mutinied. He disbanded the whole of them in anger, and gave\r\nthem leave to return to their homes, but they were filled with shame and\r\nregret, and a reconciliation took place.\r\n\r\n(M758) It was while he made a visit to Ecbatana, in the summer of B.C.\r\n324, that his favorite, Hephæstion, died. His sorrow and grief were\r\nunbounded. He cast himself upon the ground, cut his hair close, and\r\nrefused food and drink for two days. This was the most violent grief he\r\never manifested, and it was sincere. He refused to be comforted, yet\r\nsought for a distraction from his grief in festivals and ostentation of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n(M759) In the spring of B.C. 323, he marched to Babylon, where were\r\nassembled envoys from all the nations of the known world to congratulate\r\nhim for his prodigious and unprecedented successes, and invoke his\r\nfriendship, which fact indicates his wide-spread fame. At Babylon he laid\r\nplans and made preparations for the circumnavigation and conquest of\r\nArabia, and to found a great maritime city in the interior of the Persian\r\nGulf. But before setting out, he resolved to celebrate the funeral\r\nobsequies of Hephæstion with unprecedented splendor. The funeral pile was\r\ntwo hundred feet high, loaded with costly decorations, in which all the\r\ninvention of artists was exhausted. It cost twelve thousand talents, or\r\ntwelve million dollars of our money. The funeral ceremonies were succeeded\r\nby a general banquet, in which he shared, passing a whole night in\r\ndrinking with his friend Medius. This last feast was fatal. His heated\r\nblood furnished fuel for the raging fever which seized him, and which\r\ncarried him off in a few days, at the age of thirty-two, and after a reign\r\nof twelve years and eight months, June, B.C. 323.\r\n\r\n(M760) He indicated no successor. Nor could one man have governed so vast\r\nan empire with so little machinery of government. His achievements threw\r\ninto the shade those of all previous conquerors, and he was, most\r\nemphatically, the Great King—the type of all worldly power. “He had\r\nmastered, in defiance of fatigue, hardship, and combat, not merely all the\r\neastern half of the Persian empire, but unknown Indian regions beyond.\r\nBesides Macedon, Greece, and Thrace, he possessed all the treasures and\r\nforces which rendered the Persian king so formidable,” and he was exalted\r\nto all this power and grandeur by conquest at an age when a citizen of\r\nAthens was intrusted with important commands, and ten years less than the\r\nage for a Roman consul. But he was unsatisfied, and is said to have wept\r\nthat there were no more worlds to conquer. He would, had he lived,\r\ndoubtless have encountered the Romans, and all their foes, and added Italy\r\nand Spain and Carthage to his empire. But there is a limit to human\r\nsuccesses, and when his work of chastisement of the nations was done, he\r\ndied. But he left a fame never since surpassed, and “he overawes the\r\nimagination more than any personage of antiquity.” He had transcendent\r\nmerits as a general, but he was much indebted to fortunate circumstances.\r\nHe thought of new conquests, rather than of consolidating what he had\r\nmade, so that his empire must naturally be divided and subdivided at his\r\ndeath. Though divided and subdivided, the effect of those conquests\r\nremained to future generations, and had no small effect on civilization,\r\nand yet, instead of Hellenizing Asia, he rather Asiatized Hellas. That\r\nprocess, so far as it was carried out, is due to his generals—the\r\nDiadochi—Antigonas, Ptolemy, Seleucus, Lysimachus, &c., who divided\r\nbetween them the empire. But Hellenism in reality never to a great extent\r\npassed into Asia. The old Oriental habits and sentiments and intellectual\r\nqualities remained, and have survived all succeeding conquests. Oriental\r\nhabits and opinions rather invaded the western world with the progress of\r\nwealth and luxury. Asia, by the insidious influences of effeminated\r\nhabits, undermined Greece, and even Rome, rather than received from Europe\r\nnew impulses or sentiments, or institutions. A new and barbarous country\r\nmay prevail, by the aid of hardy warriors, adventurous and needy, over the\r\ncivilized nations which have been famous for a thousand years, but the\r\nconquered country almost invariably has transmitted its habits and\r\ninstitutions among the conquerors, so much more majestic are ideas than\r\nany display of victorious brute forces. Dynasties are succeeded by\r\ndynasties, but civilization survives, when any material exists on which it\r\ncan work.\r\n\r\nAthens was never a greater power in the world than at the time her\r\npolitical ruin was consummated. Hence the political changes of nations,\r\nwhich form the bulk of all histories, are insignificant in comparison with\r\nthose ideas and institutions which gradually transform the habits and\r\nopinions of ordinary life. Yet it is these silent and gradual changes\r\nwhich escape the notice of historians, and are the most difficult to be\r\nunderstood and explained, for lack of sufficient and definite knowledge.\r\nMoreover, it is the feats of extraordinary individuals in stirring\r\nenterprise and heroism which have thus far proved the great attraction of\r\npast ages to ordinary minds. No history, truly philosophical, would be\r\nextensively read by any people, in any age, and least of all by the young,\r\nin the process of education.\r\n\r\nThe remaining history of Greece has little interest until the Roman\r\nconquests, which will be presented in the next book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nROME IN ITS INFANCY, UNDER KINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn presenting the growth of that great power which gradually absorbed all\r\nother States and monarchies so as to form the largest empire ever known on\r\nearth, I shall omit a notice of all other States, in Italy and Europe,\r\nuntil they were brought into direct collision with Rome herself.\r\n\r\n(M761) The early history of Rome is involved in obscurity, and although\r\nmany great writers have expended vast learning and ingenuity in tracing\r\nthe origin of the city and its inhabitants, still but little has been\r\nestablished on an incontrovertible basis. We look to poetry and legends\r\nfor the foundation of the “Eternal City.”\r\n\r\n(M762) These legends are of peculiar interest. Æneas, in his flight from\r\nTroy, after many adventures, reaches Italy, marries the daughter of\r\nLatinus, king of the people, who then lived in Latium, and builds a city,\r\nwhich he names Lavinium, and unites his Trojan followers with the\r\naboriginal inhabitants.\r\n\r\n(M763) Latium was a small country, bounded on the north by the Tiber, on\r\nthe East by the Liris and Vinius, and on the south and west by the Tuscan\r\nSea. It was immediately surrounded by the Etruscans, Sabines, Equi, and\r\nMarsi. When Latium was originally settled we do not know, but the people\r\ndoubtless belonged to the Indo-European race, kindred to the early\r\nsettlers of Europe. Latium was a plain, inclosed by mountains and\r\ntraversed by the Tiber, of about seven hundred square miles. Between the\r\nAlban Lake and the Alban Mount, was Alba—the original seat of the Latin\r\nrace, and the mother city of Rome. Here, according to tradition, reigned\r\nAscanius, the son of Æneas, and his descendants for three hundred years\r\nwere the Latin tribes. After eleven generations of kings, Amulius usurps\r\nthe throne, which belonged to Numitor, the elder brother, and dooms his\r\nonly daughter, Silvia, to perpetual virginity as a Vestal. Silvia, visited\r\nby a god, gives birth to twins, Romulus and Remus. The twins, exposed by\r\nthe order of Amulius, are suckled by a she-wolf, and brought up by one of\r\nthe king’s herdsmen. They feed their flocks on the Palatine, but a quarrel\r\nensuing between them and the herdsmen of Numitor on the Aventine, their\r\nroyal origin is discovered, and the restoration of Numitor is effected.\r\nBut the twins resolve to found a city, and Rome arises on the Palatine, an\r\nasylum for outlaws and slaves, who are provided with wives by the “rape of\r\nthe Sabine women.”\r\n\r\n(M764) Thus, according to the legends, was the foundation of Rome, on a\r\nhill about fourteen miles from the mouth of the Tiber, and on a site less\r\nhealthy than the old Latin towns, B.C. 751, or 753. According to the\r\nspeculations of Mommsen, it would seem that Rome was at a very early\r\nperiod the resort of a lawless band of men, who fortified themselves on\r\nthe Palatine, and perhaps other hills, and robbed the small merchants, who\r\nsailed up and down the Tiber, as well as the neighboring rural population,\r\neven as the feudal barons intrenched themselves on hills overlooking\r\nplains and rivers. But all theories relating to the foundation of Rome are\r\nbased either on legend or speculation. Until we arrive at certain facts, I\r\nprefer those based on legend, such as have been accepted for more than two\r\nthousand years. It is but little consequence whether Romulus and Remus are\r\nreal characters, or poetic names. This is probable, that the situation of\r\nRome was favorable in ancient times for rapine, even if it were not a\r\nhealthy locality. The first beginnings of Rome were violence and robbery,\r\nand the murder of Remus by Romulus is a type of its early history, and\r\nwhole subsequent career.\r\n\r\n(M765) Romulus and his associate outlaws, now intrenched on the Palatine,\r\norganize a city and government, and extend the limits. The rape of the\r\nSabines leads to war, and Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines, obtains\r\npossession of the Capitoline Hill—the smallest but most famous of the\r\nseven hills on which Rome was subsequently built. In the valley between,\r\non which the forum was afterward built, the combatants are separated by\r\nthe Sabine wives of the outlaws, and the tribes or nations are united\r\nunder the name of Ramnes and Tities, the Sabines retaining the capitol and\r\nthe Quirinal, and the Romans the Palatine. Some Etruscans, in possession\r\nof the Cælian Hill, are incorporated as a third tribe, called Luceres. But\r\nit is probable that the Sabine element prevailed. Each tribe contains ten\r\ncuriæ of a hundred citizens, which, with the three hundred horsemen, form\r\na body of three thousand three hundred citizens, who alone enjoyed\r\npolitical rights.\r\n\r\n(M766) The government, though monarchical, was limited. The king was bound\r\nto lay all questions of moment before the assembly of the thirty curiæ,\r\ncalled the _Comitia Curiata_. But the king had a council called the\r\n_Senate_, composed of one hundred members, who were called _Patres_, or\r\nFathers, and doubtless were the heads of clans called _Gentes_. The Gentes\r\nwere divided into _Familiæ_, or families. These _Patres_ were the heads of\r\nthe patrician houses—that class who alone had political rights, and who\r\nwere Roman citizens.\r\n\r\n(M767) Romulus is said to have reigned justly and ably for thirty-seven\r\nyears, and no one could be found worthy to succeed him. At length the\r\nRoman tribe, the Ramnes, elected Numa Pompilius, from the Sabines, a man\r\nof wisdom and piety, and said to have acquired his learning from\r\nPythagoras. This king instituted the religious and civil legislation of\r\nRome, and built the temple of Janus in the midst of the Forum, whose doors\r\nwere shut in peace and opened in war, but were never closed from his death\r\nto the reign of Augustus, but a brief period after the first Punic war.\r\n\r\n(M768) He established the College of Pontiffs, who directed all the\r\nceremonies of religion and regulated festivals and the system of weights\r\nand measures; also the College of Augurs, who interpreted by various omens\r\nthe will of the gods; and also the College of Heralds, who guarded the\r\npublic faith. He fixed the boundaries of fields, divided the territory of\r\nRome into districts, called _pagi_, and regulated the calendar.\r\n\r\n(M769) According to the legends, Tullus Hostilius was the third king of\r\nRome, elected by the curiæ. He assigned the Cælian Mount for the poor, and\r\nthe strangers who flocked to Rome, and was a warlike sovereign. The great\r\nevent of his reign was the destruction of Alba. The growing power of Rome\r\nprovoked the jealousy of this ancient seat of Latin power, and war ensued.\r\nThe armies of the two States were drawn up in battle array, when it was\r\ndetermined that the quarrel should be settled by three champions, chosen\r\nfrom each side. Hence the beautiful story of the Curiatii and the Horatii,\r\nthree brothers on each side. Two of the Horatii were slain, and the three\r\nCuriatii were wounded. The third of the Horatii affected to fly, and was\r\npursued by the Curiatii, but as they were wounded, the third Roman subdued\r\nthem in detail, and so the Albans became subjects of the Romans. The\r\nconqueror met his sister at one of the gates, who, being betrothed to one\r\nof the Curiatii, reproached him for the death of her lover, which so\r\nincensed him that he slew her. Thus early does patriotism surmount natural\r\naffections among the Romans. But Horatius was nevertheless tried for his\r\nlife by two judges and condemned. He appealed to the people, who reversed\r\nthe judgment—the first instance on record of an appeal in a capital case\r\nto the people, which subsequently was the right of Roman citizens.\r\n\r\n(M770) Hostilities again breaking out between Alba and Rome, the former\r\ncity was demolished and the inhabitants removed to the Cæilian Mount and\r\nenrolled among the citizens. By the destruction of Alba, Rome obtained the\r\npresidency over the thirty cities of the Latin confederacy. Tullus, it\r\nwould seem, was an unscrupulous king, but able, and to him is ascribed the\r\nerection of the Curia Hostilia, where the Senate had its meetings.\r\n\r\n(M771) The Sabine Ancus Martius was the fourth king, B.C. 640, who pursued\r\nthe warlike policy of his predecessor, conquering many Latin towns, and\r\nincorporating their inhabitants with the Romans, whom he settled on Mount\r\nAventine. They were freemen, but not citizens. They were called plebeians,\r\nwith modified civil, but not political rights, and were the origin of that\r\ngreat middle class which afterward became so formidable. The plebeians,\r\nthough of the same race as the Romans, were a conquered people, and yet\r\nwere not reduced to slavery like most conquered people among the ancients.\r\nThey had their Gentes and Familiæ, but they could not intermarry with the\r\npatricians. Though they were not citizens, they were bound to fight for\r\nthe State, for which, as a compensation, they retained their lands, that\r\nis, their old possessions.\r\n\r\n(M772) On the death, B.C. 616, of Ancus Marlius, Lucius Tarquinius, of an\r\nEtruscan family, became king, best known as Tarquinius Priscus. He had\r\nbeen guardian of the two sons of Ancus, but offered himself as candidate\r\nfor the throne, from which it would appear that the monarchs were elected\r\nby the people.\r\n\r\n(M773) He carried on successful war against the Latins and Sabines, and\r\nintroduced from Etruria, by permission of the Senate, a golden crown, an\r\nivory chain, a sceptre topped with an eagle, and a crimson robe studded\r\nwith gold—emblems of royalty. But he is best known for various public\r\nworks of great magnificence at the time, as well as of public utility.\r\nAmong these was the Cloaca Maxima, to drain the marshy land between the\r\nPalatine and the Tiber—a work so great, that Niebuhr ranks it with the\r\npyramids. It has lasted, without the displacement of a stone, for more\r\nthan two thousand years. It shows that the use of the arch was known at\r\nthat period. The masonry of the stones is perfect, joined together without\r\ncement. Tarquin also instituted public games, and reigned with more\r\nsplendor than we usually associate with an infant State.\r\n\r\n(M774) This king, who excited the jealousy of the patricians, was\r\nassassinated B.C. 578, and Servius Tullius reigned in his stead. He was\r\nthe greatest of the Roman kings, and arose to his position by eminent\r\nmerit, being originally obscure. He married the daughter of Tarquin, and\r\nshared all his political plans.\r\n\r\n(M775) He is most celebrated for remodeling the constitution. He left the\r\nold institutions untouched, but added new ones. He made a new territorial\r\ndivision of the State, and created a popular assembly. He divided the\r\nwhole population into thirty tribes, at the head of each of which was a\r\ntribune. Each tribe managed its own local affairs, and held public\r\nmeetings. These tribes included both patricians and plebeians. This was\r\nthe commencement of the power of the plebs, which was seen with great\r\njealousy by the patricians.\r\n\r\n(M776) The basis or principle of the new organization of Servius was the\r\npossession of property. All free citizens, whether patricians or\r\nplebeians, were called to defend the State, and were enrolled in the army.\r\nThe equites, or cavalry, took the precedence in the army, and was composed\r\nof the wealthy citizens. There were eighteen centuries of these knights,\r\nsix patrician and twelve plebeian, all having more than one hundred\r\nthousand ases. They were armed with sword, spear, helmet, shield, greaves,\r\nand cuirass. The infantry was composed of the classes, variously armed, of\r\nwhich, including equites, there were one hundred and ninety-four\r\ncenturies, one hundred of whom were of the first rank, heavily armed—all\r\nmen possessing one hundred thousand ases. Each class was divided into\r\nseniores—men between forty-five and sixty, and juniores—from seventeen to\r\nforty-five. The former were liable to be called out only in emergencies.\r\nThis division of the citizens was a purely military one, and each century\r\nhad one vote. But as the first class numbered one hundred centuries, each\r\nman of which was worth land valued at one hundred thousand ases, it could\r\ncast a larger vote than all the other classes, which numbered only\r\nninety-four together. Thus the rich controlled all public affairs.\r\n\r\n(M777) To this military body of men, in which the rich preponderated,\r\nServius committed all the highest functions of the State, for the Comitia\r\nCenturiata possessed elective, judicial, and legislative functions.\r\nServius also rendered many other benefits to the plebeians, He divided\r\namong them the lands gained from the Etruscans. He inclosed the city with\r\na wall, which remained for centuries, embracing the seven hills on which\r\nRome was built. But it is as the hero of the plebeian order that he is\r\nfamous, and paid the penalty for being such. He was assassinated, probably\r\nby the instigation of the patricians, by his son-in-law, Lucius\r\nTarquinius, who mounted his throne as Tarquinius Superbus, the last king\r\nof Rome, B.C. 534. The daughter of the murdered king, Tullia, who rode in\r\nher chariot over his bleeding body, is enrolled among the infamous women\r\nof antiquity.\r\n\r\n(M778) Tarquinius Superbus, a usurper and murderer, abrogated the popular\r\nlaws of Servius Tullius, and set aside even the assembly of the Curiæ, and\r\ndegraded and decimated the Senate, and appropriated the confiscated\r\nestates of those whom he destroyed. He reigned as a despot, making\r\ntreaties without consulting the Senate, and living for his pleasure alone.\r\nBut he ornamented the city with magnificent edifices, and completed the\r\nCircus Maximus as well as the Capitoline Temple, which stood five hundred\r\nyears. He was also successful in war, and exalted the glory of the Roman\r\nname.\r\n\r\n(M779) An end came to his tyranny by one of those events on which poetry\r\nand history have alike exhausted all their fascinations. It was while\r\nTarquin was conducting a war against Ardea, and the army was idly encamped\r\nbefore the town, that the sons of Tarquin, with their kinsmen, were\r\nsupping in the tent of Sextus, that conversation turned upon the\r\ncomparative virtue of their wives. By a simultaneous impulse, they took\r\nhorse to see the manner in which these ladies were at the time employed.\r\nThe wives of Tarquin’s sons at Rome were found in luxurious banquets with\r\nother women. Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus, was discovered carding wool\r\nin the midst of her maidens. The boast of Collatinus that his wife was the\r\nmost virtuous was confirmed. But her charms or virtues made a deep\r\nimpression on the heart or passions of Sextus, and he returned to her\r\ndwelling in Collatia to propose infamous overtures. They were proudly\r\nrejected, but the disappointed lover, by threats and force, accomplished\r\nhis purpose. Lucretia, stung with shame, made known the crime of Sextus to\r\nher husband and father, who hastened to her house, accompanied with\r\nBrutus. They found the ravished beauty in agonies of shame and revenge,\r\nand after she had revealed the scandalous facts, she plunged a dagger in\r\nher own bosom and died, invoking revenge. Her relatives and friends\r\ncarried her corpse to the market-place, revealed the atrocity of the crime\r\nof Sextus, and demanded vengeance. The people rallied in the Forum at\r\nRome, and the assembled Curiæ deprived Tarquin of his throne, and decreed\r\nthe banishment of his accursed family. On the news of the insurrection,\r\nthe tyrant started for the city with a band of chosen followers, but\r\nBrutus reached the army after the king had left, recounted the wrongs, and\r\nmarched to Rome, whose gates were already shut against Tarquin. He fled to\r\nEtruria, with two of his sons, but Sextus was murdered by the people of\r\nGabii.\r\n\r\n(M780) Thus were the kings driven out of Rome, never to return. In the\r\nrevolution which followed, the patricians recovered their power, and a new\r\nform of government was instituted, republican in name, but oligarchal and\r\naristocratic in reality, two hundred and forty-five years after the\r\nfoundation of the city, B.C. 510. Historical criticism throws doubt on the\r\nchronology which assigns two hundred and forty-five years to seven\r\nelective kings, and some critics think that a longer period elapsed from\r\nthe reign of Romulus to that of Tarquin than legend narrates, and that\r\nthere must have been a great number of kings whose names are unknown. As\r\nthe city advanced in wealth and numbers, the popular influence increased.\r\nThe admission of commons favored the establishment of despotism, and its\r\nexcesses led to its overthrow. It would have been better for the commons\r\nhad Brutus established a monarchy with more limited powers, for the\r\nplebeians were now subjected to the tyranny of a proud and grasping\r\noligarchy, and lost a powerful protector in the king, and the whole\r\ninternal history of Rome, for nearly two centuries, were the conflicts\r\nbetween the plebeians and their aristocratic masters for the privileges\r\nthey were said to possess under the reign of Tullius. Under the patricians\r\nthe growth of the city was slow, and it was not till the voices of the\r\ntribunes were heard that Rome advanced in civilization and liberty. Under\r\nthe kings, the progress in arts and culture had been rapid.\r\n\r\n(M781) Mommsen, in his learned and profound history of Rome, enumerates\r\nthe various forms of civilization that existed on the expulsion of the\r\nTarquins, a summary of which I present. Law and justice were already\r\nenforced on some of the elemental principles which marked the Roman\r\njurisprudence. The punishment of offenses against order was severe, and\r\ncompensation for crime, where injuries to person and property were slight,\r\nwas somewhat similar to the penalties of the Mosaic code. The idea of\r\nproperty was associated with estate in slaves and cattle, and all property\r\npassed freely from hand to hand; but it was not in the power of the father\r\narbitrarily to deprive his children of their hereditary rights. Contracts\r\nbetween the State and a citizen were valid without formalities, but those\r\nbetween private persons were difficult to be enforced. A purchase only\r\nfounded an action in the event of its being a transaction for ready money,\r\nand this was attested by witnesses. Protection was afforded to minors and\r\nfor the estate of persons not capable of bearing arms. After a man’s\r\ndeath, his property descended to his nearest heirs. The emancipation of\r\nslaves was difficult, and that of a son was attended with even greater\r\ndifficulties. Burgesses and clients were equally free in their private\r\nrights, but foreigners were beyond the pale of the law. The laws indicated\r\na great progress in agriculture and commerce, but the foundation of law\r\nwas the State. The greatest liberality in the permission of commerce, and\r\nthe most rigorous procedure in execution, went hand in hand. Women were\r\nplaced on a legal capacity with men, though restricted in the\r\nadministration of their property. Personal credit was extravagant and\r\neasy, but the creditor could treat the debtor like a thief. A freeman\r\ncould not, indeed, be tortured, but he could be imprisoned for debt with\r\nmerciless severity. From the first, the laws of property were stringent\r\nand inexorable.\r\n\r\n(M782) In religion, the ancient Romans, like the Greeks, personified the\r\npowers of nature, and also abstractions, like sowing, field labor, war,\r\nboundary, youth, health, harmony, fidelity. The profoundest worship was\r\nthat of the tutelary deities, who presided over the household. Next to the\r\ndeities of the house and forest, held in the greatest veneration, was\r\nHercules, the god of the inclosed homestead, and, therefore, of property\r\nand gain. The souls of departed mortals were supposed to haunt the spot\r\nwhere the bodies reposed, but dwelt in the depths below. The hero worship\r\nof the Greeks was uncommon, and even Numa was never worshiped as a god.\r\nThe central object of worship was Mars, the god of war, and this was\r\nconducted by imposing ceremonies and rites. The worship of Vesta was held\r\nwith peculiar sacredness, and the vestal virgins were the last to yield to\r\nChristianity. The worshipers of the gods often consulted priests and\r\naugurs, who had great colleges, but little power in the State. The Latin\r\nworship was grounded on man’s enjoyment of earthly pleasures, and not on\r\nhis fear of the wild forces of nature, and it gradually sunk into a dreary\r\nround of ceremonies. The Italian god was simply an instrument for the\r\nattainment of worldly ends, and not an object of profound awe or love, and\r\nhence the Latin worship was unfavorable to poetry, as well as\r\nphilosophical speculation.\r\n\r\n(M783) Agriculture is ever a distinguishing mark of civilization, and\r\nforms the main support of a people. It early occupied the time of the\r\nLatins, and was their chief pursuit. In the earliest ages arable land was\r\ncultivated in common, and was not distributed among the people as their\r\nspecial property, but in the time of Servius there was a distribution.\r\nAttention was chiefly given to cereals, but roots and vegetables were also\r\ndiligently cultivated. Vineyards were introduced before the Greeks made\r\nsettlements in Italy, but the olive was brought to Italy by the Greeks.\r\nThe fig-tree is a native of Italy. The plow was drawn by oxen, while\r\nhorses, asses, and mules were used as beasts of burden. The farm was\r\nstocked with swine and poultry, especially geese. The plow was a rude\r\ninstrument, but no field was reckoned perfectly tilled unless the furrows\r\nwere so close that harrowing was deemed unnecessary. Farming on a large\r\nscale was not usual, and the proprietor of land worked on the soil with\r\nhis sons. The use of slaves was a later custom, when large estates arose.\r\n\r\n(M784) Trades scarcely kept pace with agriculture, although in the time of\r\nNuma eight guilds of craftsmen were numbered among the institutions of\r\nRome—flute-blowers, goldsmiths, coppersmiths, carpenters, fullers, dyers,\r\npotters, and shoemakers. There was no yield for workers in iron, which\r\nshows that iron was a later introduction than copper.\r\n\r\n(M785) Commerce was limited to the mutual dealings of the Italians\r\nthemselves. Fairs are of great antiquity, distinguished from ordinary\r\nmarkets, and barter and traffic were carried on in them, especially that\r\nof Soracte, being before Greek or Phœnicians entered from the sea. Oxen\r\nand sheep, grain and slaves, were the common mediums of exchange. Latium\r\nwas, however, deficient of articles of export, and was pre-eminently an\r\nagricultural country.\r\n\r\n(M786) The use of measures and weights was earlier than the art of\r\nwriting, although the latter is of high antiquity. Latin poetry began in\r\nthe lyrical form. Dancing was a common trade, and this was accompanied\r\nwith pipers, and religious litanies were sung from the remotest antiquity.\r\nComic songs were sung in Saturnian metre, accompanied by the pipe. The art\r\nof dancing was a public care, and a powerful impulse was early given by\r\nHellenic games. But in all the arts of music and poetry there was not the\r\neasy development as in Greece. Architecture owed its first impulse to the\r\nEtruscans, who borrowed from the Greeks, and was not of much account till\r\nthe reigns of the Tuscan kings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN REPUBLIC TILL THE INVASION OF THE GAULS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M787) The Tarquins being expelled, political power fell into the hands of\r\nthe patricians, under whose government the city slowly increased in wealth\r\nand population, but it was the heroic period of Roman history, and the\r\nlegends of patriotic bravery are of great interest.\r\n\r\n(M788) The despotism of Tarquinius Superbus inflamed all classes with\r\ndetestation of the very name of king—the wealthy classes, because they\r\nwere deprived of their ancient powers; the poorer classes, because they\r\nwere oppressed with burdens. The executive power of the State was\r\ntransferred to two men, called consuls, annually elected from the\r\npatrician ranks. But they ruled with restricted powers, and were shorn of\r\nthe trappings of royalty. They could not nominate priests, and they were\r\namenable to the laws after their term of office expired. They were elected\r\nby the Comitia Centuriata, in which the patrician power predominated. They\r\nconvened the Senate, introduced ambassadors, and commanded the armies. In\r\npublic, they were attended by lictors, and wore, as a badge of authority,\r\na purple border on the toga.\r\n\r\n(M789) The Senate, a great power, still retained its dignity. The members\r\nwere elected for life, and were the advisers of the consuls. They were\r\nelected by the consuls; but, as the consuls were practically chosen by the\r\nwealthy classes, men were chosen to the Senate who belonged to powerful\r\nfamilies. The Senate was a judicial and legislative body, and numbered\r\nthree hundred men. All men who had held curule magistracies became\r\nmembers. Their decisions, called Senatus Consulta, became laws—_leges_.\r\n\r\nThe Roman government at this time was purely oligarchic. The\r\naristocratical clement prevailed. Nobles virtually controlled the State.\r\n\r\n(M790) Brutus, on the overthrow of the monarchy, was elected the first\r\nconsul B.C. 507 with L. Tarquinius Colatinus; but the latter was not\r\nallowed to possess his office, from hatred of his family, and he withdrew\r\npeaceably to Lavinium, and Publius Valerius was elected consul in his\r\nstead—a harsh measure, prompted by necessity.\r\n\r\n(M791) The history of Rome at this period is legendary. The story goes\r\nthat Tarquin, at the head of the armies of Veii and Tarquinii, seeking to\r\nrecover his throne, marched against Rome, and that for thirteen years he\r\nstruggled with various success, assisted by Porsenna, king of Etruria. The\r\nlegends say Horatius Cocles defended a bridge, single-handed, against the\r\nwhole Etrurian army—that Mamillus, the ruler of Tuscalum, fought a battle\r\nat Lake Regillus, in which the cause of Tarquin was lost—the subject of\r\nthe most beautiful of Macaulay’s lays—and that Mutius Scævola attempted to\r\nassassinate Porsenna, and, as a proof of his fortitude, held his hand in\r\nthe fire until it was consumed, which act converted Porsenna into a\r\nfriend. Another interesting legend is related in reference to Brutus, who\r\nslew his own sons for their sympathy with, and treasonable aid, to the\r\nbanished king. These stories are not history, but still shed light on the\r\nspirit of the time. It is probable that Tarquin made desperate efforts to\r\nrecover his dominion, aided by the Etruscans, and that the first wars of\r\nthe republic were against them.\r\n\r\n(M792) The Etruscans were then in the height of their power, and were in\r\nclose alliance with the Carthaginians. Etruria was a larger State than\r\nLatium, from which it was separated by the Tiber. It was bounded on the\r\nwest by the Tyrrhenian Sea, on the north by the Appenines, and the east by\r\nUmbria. Among the cities were Veii and Tarquinii, the latter the\r\nbirthplace of Tarquinius Priscus, and the former the powerful rival of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n(M793) In the war with the Etruscans, the Romans were worsted, and they\r\nlost all their territory on the right bank of the Tiber, won by the kings,\r\nand were thrown back on their original limits. But the Etruscans were\r\ndriven back, by the aid of the Latin cities, beyond the Tiber. It took\r\nRome one hundred and fifty years to recover what she had lost.\r\n\r\n(M794) It was in those wars with the Etruscans that we first read of\r\ndictators, extraordinary magistrates, appointed in great political\r\nexigencies. The dictator, or commander, was chosen by one of the consuls,\r\nand his authority was supreme, but lasted only for six months. He had all\r\nthe powers of the ancient kings.\r\n\r\n(M795) The misfortunes of the Romans, in the contest with the Etruscans,\r\nled to other political changes, and internal troubles. The strife between\r\nthe patricians and the plebeians now began, and lasted two centuries\r\nbefore the latter were admitted to a full equality of civil rights. The\r\ncause of the conflict, it would appear, was the unequal and burdensome\r\ntaxation to which the plebeians were subjected, and especially vexations\r\nfrom the devastations which war produced. They were small land-owners, and\r\ntheir little farms were overrun by the enemy, and they were in no\r\ncondition to bear the burdens imposed upon them: and this inequality of\r\ntaxation was the more oppressive, since they had no political power. They\r\nnecessarily incurred debts, which were rigorously exacted, and they thus\r\nbecame the property of their creditors.\r\n\r\n(M796) In their despair, they broke out in open rebellion, in the\r\nfifteenth year of the republic, during the consulship of Publius Servilius\r\nand Appius Claudius—the latter a proud Sabine nobleman, who had lately\r\nsettled in Rome. They took position on a hill between the Anio and Tiber,\r\ncommanding the most fertile part of the Roman territory. The patrician and\r\nwealthy classes, abandoned by the farmers, who tilled the lands, were\r\ncompelled to treat, in spite of the opposition of Appius Claudius. And the\r\nresult was, that the plebeians gained a remission of their debts, and the\r\nappointment of two magistrates, as protectors, under the name of tribunes.\r\n\r\n(M797) This new office introduced the first great change in the condition\r\nof the plebeians. The tribunes had the power of putting a stop to the\r\nexecution of the law which condemned debtors to imprisonment or a military\r\nlevy. Their jurisdiction extended over every citizen, even over the\r\nconsul. There was no appeal from their decisions, except in the Comitia\r\nTributa, where the plebeian interest predominated—an assembly representing\r\nthe thirty Roman tribes, according to the Servian constitution, but which,\r\nat first, had insignificant powers. The persons of the tribunes were\r\ninviolable, but their power was negative. They could not originate laws;\r\nthey could insure the equitable administration of the laws, and prevent\r\nwrongs. They had a constitutional veto, of great use at the time, but\r\nwhich ended in a series of dangerous encroachments.\r\n\r\n(M798) The office of ædiles followed that of tribunes. There were at first\r\ntwo, selected from plebeians, whose duty it was to guard the law creating\r\ntribunes, which was deposited in the temple of Vesta, They were afterward\r\nthe keepers of the resolutions of the Senate as well as of the plebs, and\r\nhad the care of public buildings, and the sanitary police of the city, the\r\ndistribution of corn, and of the public lands, the superintendence of\r\nmarkets and measures, the ordering of festivals, and the duty to see that\r\nno new deities or rites were introduced.\r\n\r\n(M799) One year after the victory of the plebeians, a distinguished man\r\nappeared, who was their bitter enemy. This was Caius Marcius, called\r\nCoriolanus, from his bravery at the capture of a Volscian town, Corioli.\r\nWhen a famine pressed the city, a supply of corn was sent by a Sicilian\r\nprince, but the proud patrician proposed to the Senate to withhold it from\r\nthe plebeians until they surrendered their privileges. The rage of the\r\nplebeians was intense, and he was impeached by the tribunes, and condemned\r\nby the popular assembly to exile. He went over, in indignation, to the\r\nVolscians, became their general, defeated the Romans, and marched against\r\ntheir city. In this emergency, the city was saved by the intercession of\r\nhis mother, Volumnia, who went to seek him in his camp, accompanied by\r\nother Roman matrons.\r\n\r\n(M800) A greater man than he, was Spurius Cassius, who rendered public\r\nservices of the greatest magnitude, yet a man whose illustrious deeds no\r\npoet sang. He lived in a great crisis, when the Etruscan war had destroyed\r\nthe Roman dominions on the right bank of the Tiber, and where the\r\nVolscians and Acquians were advancing with superior forces. Rome was in\r\ndanger of being conquered, and not only conquered, but reduced to\r\nservitude. But he concluded a league with the Latins, and also with the\r\nHernicians—a Sabine people, who dwelt in one of the valleys of the\r\nAppenines, by which the power of Rome was threatened. He is also known as\r\nthe first who proposed an agrarian law. It seems that the patricians had\r\noccupied the public lands to the exclusion of the plebeians. Spurius\r\nCassius proposed to the Comitia Centuriata that the public domain—land\r\nobtained by conquest—should be measured, and a part reserved for the use\r\nof the State, and another portion distributed among the needy citizens—a\r\njust proposition, since no property held by individuals was meddled with.\r\nThis popular measure was carried against violent opposition, but when the\r\nterm of office of Cassius as consul expired, he was accused before the\r\ncuriæ, who assumed the right to judge a patrician, and he lost his life.\r\nHe was accused of seeking to usurp regal power, because he had sought to\r\nprotect the commons against his own order. “His law was buried with him,\r\nbut its spectre haunted the rich, and again and again it arose from its\r\ntomb, till the conflicts to which it led destroyed the commonwealth.”\r\n\r\n(M801) The following seven years was a period of incessant war with the\r\nAcquians and Veientines, as well as dissensions in the city, during which\r\nthe great house of the Fabii arose to power, for Fabius was chosen consul\r\nseven successive years, and even proposed the execution of the agrarian\r\nlaw of Cassius, for which he was scorned by the patricians, and left Rome\r\nin disgust, with his family, and all were afterward massacred by the\r\nVeientines. But one of the tribunes accused the consuls for their\r\nopposition of the tribunes for the execution of the agrarian law. He was\r\nassassinated. This violation of the sacred person of a tribune created\r\ngreat indignation among the commons, and Volero, a tribune, proposed the\r\ncelebrated “Publilian Law,” that the tribunes henceforth, as well as the\r\nplebeian ædiles, should be elected by the plebeians themselves in the\r\nComitia Tributa. Great disorders followed, but the commons prevailed, and\r\nthe Senate adopted the plebiscitum, and proposed it to the Comitia\r\nCuriata, and it became a law. This step raised the authority of the\r\ntribunes, and added to Roman liberties.\r\n\r\n(M802) The critical condition of Rome, from the renewed assaults of the\r\nAcquians and Volscians, led to the appointment of another very remarkable\r\nman to the dictatorship—L. Quintius Cincinnatus, a patrician, who\r\nmaintained the virtues of better days. He cultivated a little farm of four\r\njugera with his own hands, and lived with great simplicity. He summoned\r\nevery man of military age to meet him in the Campus Martius, and these\r\nwere provided with rations for five days. He then marched against the\r\ntriumphant enemy, surrounded them, and compelled them to surrender. He\r\nmade no use of his political power, and after sixteen days, laid down the\r\ndictatorship, and retired to his farm, B.C. 458. All subsequent ages and\r\nnations have embalmed the memory of this true patriot, who preferred the\r\nquiet labors of his small farm of three and a half acres to the enjoyment\r\nof absolute power.\r\n\r\nBut his victory was not decisive, and the Romans continued to be harassed\r\nby the neighboring nations, and they, moreover, suffered all the evils of\r\npestilence. It was at this time, in the three hundredth year of the city,\r\nthat they sought to make improvements in their laws—at least, to embody\r\nlaws in a written form. Greece was then in the height of her glory, in the\r\ninterval between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars, and thither a\r\ncommission was sent to examine her laws, especially those of Solon, at\r\nAthens. On the return of the three commissioners, a new commission of ten\r\nwas appointed to draw up a new code, composed wholly of patricians, at the\r\nhead of which was Appius Claudius, consul elect, a man of commanding\r\ninfluence and talents, but ill-regulated passions and unscrupulous\r\nambition. The new code was engraved upon ten tables, and subsequently two\r\nmore tables were added, and these twelve tables are the foundation of the\r\nRoman jurisprudence, that branch of science which the Romans carried to\r\nconsiderable perfection, and for which they are most celebrated. The\r\njurisprudence of Rome has survived all her conquests, and is the most\r\nvaluable contribution to civilization which she ever made.\r\n\r\n(M803) The decemvirs—those who codified the laws—came into supreme power,\r\nand suspended the other great magistracies, and ruled, under the direction\r\nof Appius Claudius, in an arbitrary and tyrannical manner. Their power\r\ncame to an end in a signal manner, and the history of their fall is\r\nidentified with one of the most beautiful legends of this heroic age,\r\nwhich is also the subject of one of Macaulay’s lays.\r\n\r\n(M804) Appius Claudius, who perhaps aspired to regal power, became\r\nenamored of the daughter of a centurion, L. Virginius. In order to gratify\r\nhis passions, Claudius suborned a false accuser, one of his clients, who\r\nwas to pretend that the mother of Virginia had been his slave. Appius sat\r\nin judgment, and against his own laws, and also the entreaties of the\r\npeople, declared her to be the slave of the accuser. Her father returned\r\nfrom the army, and in his indignation plunged a dagger in her breast,\r\npreferring her death to shame. The people and soldiers rallied around the\r\ncourageous soldier, took the capitol, and compelled the decemvirs to lay\r\ndown their office. The result of this insurrection was the creation of ten\r\ntribunes instead of the old number, and ten continued to be the regular\r\nnumber of tribunes till the fall of the republic. It was further decreed\r\nthat the votes of the plebs, passed in the Comitia Tributa, should be\r\nbinding on the whole people, provided they were confirmed by the Senate\r\nand the assemblies of the curias and centuries. The persons of the\r\ntribunes were declared to be inviolable, under the sanctions of religion,\r\nand they, moreover, were admitted to the deliberations of the Senate,\r\nthough without a vote. Thus did the commons ascend another step in\r\npolitical influence, B.C. 449. The next movement of the commons was to\r\ntake vengeance on Appius Claudius, who ended his life in prison.\r\n\r\n(M805) The plebs, now strengthened by the plebeian nobles, who sought\r\npower through the tribunate, insisted on the abrogation of the law which\r\nprevented the marriage of plebeians with patricians. This was effected\r\nfour years later, B.C. 445. These then attempted to secure the higher\r\nmagistracies, but this was prevented for a time, although they acquired\r\nthe right of plebeians to become military tribunes, or chief officer of\r\nthe legions, but none of the plebeians arose to that rank for several\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n(M806) A new office of great dignity was now created, that of censors, who\r\nwere chosen from men who had been consuls, and therefore had higher rank\r\nthan they. It was their duty to superintend the public morals, take the\r\ncensus, and administer the finances. They could brand with ignominy the\r\nhighest officers of the State, could elect to the Senate, and control,\r\nwith the ædiles, the public buildings and works. There were two elected to\r\nthis high office, and were chosen from the patrician ranks till the year\r\nB.C. 421, when plebeians were admitted. They were even held in great\r\nreverence, and enjoyed a larger term of office than the consuls, even of\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\n(M807) The commons gained additional importance by the opening of the\r\nquæstorship to the plebeians, which took place about this time. The\r\nquæstors virtually had charge of the public money, and were the paymasters\r\nof the army. As these were curule officers, they had, by their office,\r\nadmission to the Senate. Another great increase of power among the\r\nplebeians, about twenty years after the decemviral legislature, was the\r\nright, transferred from the curiæ to the centuries, of determining peace\r\nand war.\r\n\r\n(M808) While these internal changes were in progress, the State was in\r\nalmost constant war with the Volscians and Acquians, and also with the\r\nEtruscans. The former were kept at bay by the aid of the Latin and\r\nHernican allies. The latter were more formidable foes, and especially the\r\ninhabitants of Veii—a powerful city in the plain of Southern Etruria, and\r\nthe largest of the confederated Etruscan cities, equal in size to Athens,\r\ndefended by a strong citadel on a hill. The Veientines, not willing to\r\ncontend with the Romans in the field, shut themselves up in their strong\r\ncity, to which the Romans laid siege. They drew around it a double line of\r\ncircumvallation, the inner one to prevent egress from the city, the outer\r\none to defend themselves against external attacks. The siege lasted ten\r\nyears, as long as that of Troy, but was finally taken by the great\r\nCamillus, by means of a mine under the citadel. The fall of this strong\r\nplace was followed by the submission of all the Etruscan cities south of\r\nthe Ciminian forest, and the lands of the people of Veii were distributed\r\namong the whole Roman people, at the rate of seven jugera to each\r\nlandholder, B.C. 396.\r\n\r\n(M809) But this event was soon followed by a great calamity to Rome—the\r\ngreatest she had ever suffered. The city fell into the hands of the\r\nGauls—a Celtic race. They were rather pastoral than agricultural, and\r\nreared great numbers of swine. They had little attachment to the soil,\r\nlike the Italians and Germans, and delighted in towns. Their chief\r\nqualities were personal bravery, an impetuous temper, boundless vanity,\r\nand want of perseverance. They were good soldiers and bad citizens. They\r\nwere fond of a roving life, and given to pillage. They loved ornaments and\r\nsplendid dresses, and wore a gold collar round the neck. After an\r\nexpedition, they abandoned themselves to carousals. They sprung from the\r\nsame cradle as the Hellenic, Italian, and German people. Their first great\r\nmigration flowed past the Alps, and we find them in Gaul, Britain, and\r\nSpain. From these settlements, they proceeded westward across the Alps. In\r\nsuccessive waves they invaded Italy. It was at the height of Etruscan\r\npower, that they assumed a hostile attitude. From Etruria they proceeded\r\nto the Roman territories.\r\n\r\n(M810) The first battle with these terrible foes resulted disastrously to\r\nthe Romans, who regarded them as half-disciplined barbarians, and\r\nunderrated their strength. Their defeat was complete, and their losses\r\nimmense. The flower of the Roman youth perished, B.C. 390.\r\n\r\n(M811) The victors entered Rome without resistance, while the Romans\r\nretreated to their citadel, such as were capable of bearing arms. The rest\r\nof the population dispersed. The fathers of the city, aged citizens, and\r\npriests, seated themselves in the porches of their patrician houses, and\r\nawaited the enemy. At first, they were mistaken for gods, so venerable and\r\ncalm their appearance; but the profanation of the sacred person of\r\nPapirius dissolved the charm, and they were massacred.\r\n\r\n(M812) The Gauls then attempted to assault the capital, but failed. But a\r\nyouth, Pontius Cominius, having climbed the hill in the night with safety,\r\nand opened communication with the Romans at Veii, the marks of his passage\r\nsuggested to the Gauls the means of taking the citadel. In the dead of the\r\nfollowing night a party of Gauls scaled the cliff, and were about to\r\nsurprise the citadel, when some geese, sacred to Juno, cried out and\r\nflapped their wings, which noise awakened M. Manlius, who rushed to the\r\ncliff and overpowered the foremost Gaul. A panic seized the rest, and the\r\ncapitol was saved. At length, when the siege had lasted seven months, and\r\nfamine pressed, the invaders were bought off by a ransom of one thousand\r\npounds weight of gold. “The iron of the barbarians had conquered; but they\r\nsold their victory, and by selling, lost it.” They were subsequently\r\ndefeated by Camillus, and Manlius, surnamed Torquatus, from the gold\r\ncollar he took from a gigantic Gaul, and also by other generals.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of Rome was not a permanent calamity; it was a misfortune.\r\nThe period which followed was one of distress, but the energy of Camillus\r\nreorganized the military force, and new alliances were made with the Latin\r\ncities. Etruria, humbled and restricted within narrower limits, and\r\nmoreover enervated by luxury, was in no condition to oppose a people\r\ninured to danger and sobered by adversity.\r\n\r\n(M813) The subsequent fate of Manlius, who saved the city, suggests the\r\nfickleness and ingratitude of a republican State. The distress of the\r\nlower classes, in consequence of the Gaulish invasion, became intolerable.\r\nThey became involved in debt, and thus were in the power of their\r\ncreditors. Manlius undertook to be their defender, but the envy of the\r\npatricians caused him to be accused of aspiring to the supreme power, and\r\nhe was, in spite of his great services, sentenced to death and hurled from\r\nthe Tarpeian rock. His error was in premature reform. But, in the year 367\r\nB.C., the tribunes Licinius and L. Sextius secured the passage of three\r\nmemorable laws in the Curiata Tributa—the abolition of the military\r\ntribunate, which had increased the power of the patricians, and the\r\nrestoration of the consulate, on the condition that one of the consuls\r\nshould be a plebeian; the second, that no citizen should possess more than\r\nfive hundred jugera of the public lands; and the third, that all interest\r\nthus paid on loans should be deducted from the principal. These were\r\ncalled the _Licinian Rogations_. But a new curule magistracy was created,\r\nas a sort of compensation to the patricians, that of prætors, to be held\r\nby them, exclusively. These political changes were made peaceably, and\r\nwith them the old gentile aristocracy ceased to be a political\r\ninstitution. The remaining patrician offices were not long withheld from\r\nthe plebeians. But these political changes did not much ameliorate the\r\nsocial condition of the poorer classes. The strictness of the Licinian\r\nlaws, the oppression of the rich, the high rate of interest, and the\r\nexistence of slavery, made the poor poorer, and the rich richer, and\r\nprevented the expansion of industry. The plebeians had gained political\r\nprivileges, but not till great plebeian families had arisen. Power was\r\nvirtually in the hands of nobles, whether patrician or plebeian, and\r\naristocratic distinctions still remained. The plebeian noble sympathized\r\nwith patricians rather than with the poorer classes. Debt, usury, and\r\nslavery began to bear fruits before the conquest of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto, the Romans, after the expulsion of the kings, were involved in\r\nwars with their immediate neighbors, and exposed to great calamities. All\r\nthey could do for one hundred and fifty years was to recover the\r\npossessions they had lost. During this period great prodigies of valor\r\nwere performed, and great virtues were generated. It was the heroic period\r\nof their history, when adversity taught them patience, endurance, and\r\npublic virtue.\r\n\r\n(M814) But a new period opens, when the plebeians had obtained political\r\npower, and the immediate enemies were subdued. This was a period of\r\nconquest over the various Italian States. The period is still heroic, but\r\nhistorical. Great men arose, of talent and patriotism. The ambition of the\r\nRomans now prominently appears. They had been struggling for\r\nexistence—they now fought for conquest. “The great achievement of the\r\nregal period was the establishment,” says Mommsen, “of the sovereignty of\r\nRome over Latium.” That was shaken by the expulsion of Tarquin, but was\r\nre-established in the wars which subsequently followed. After the fall of\r\nVeii, all the Latin cities became subject to the Romans. On the overthrow\r\nof the Volscians, the Roman armies reached the Samnite territory.\r\n\r\n(M815) The next memorable struggle of Rome was with Samnium, for the\r\nsupremacy of Italy. Samnium was a hilly country on the east of the\r\nVolscians, and its people were brave and hardy. The Samnites had, at the\r\nfall of Veii, an ascendency over Lower Italy, with the exception of the\r\nGrecian colonies. Tarentum, Croton, Metapontum, Heraclea, Neapolis, and\r\nother Grecian cities, maintained a precarious independence, but were\r\nweakened by the successes of the Samnites. Capua, the capital of Campania,\r\nwhere the Etruscan influence predominated, was taken by them, and Cumæ was\r\nwrested from the Greeks.\r\n\r\nBut in the year B.C. 343, the Samnites came in collision with Rome, from\r\nan application of Capua to Rome for assistance against them. The victories\r\nof Valerius Corvus, and Cornelius Cossus gave Campania to the Romans.\r\n\r\n(M816) In the mean time the Latins had recovered strength, and determined\r\nto shake off the Roman yoke, and the Romans made peace with the Samnites\r\nand formed a close alliance, B.C. 341. The Romans and Samnites were ranged\r\nagainst the Latins and Campanians. The hostile forces came in sight of\r\neach other before Capua, and the first great battle was fought at the foot\r\nof Mount Vesuvius. It was here that Titus Manlius, the son of the consul,\r\nwas beheaded by him for disobedience of orders, for the consuls issued\r\nstrict injunctions against all skirmishing, and Manlius, disregarding\r\nthem, slew an enemy in single combat. “The consul’s cruelty was execrated,\r\nbut the discipline of the army was saved.”\r\n\r\n(M817) This engagement furnishes another legend of the heroic and\r\npatriotic self-devotion of those early Romans. The consuls, before the\r\nbattle, dreamed that the general on the one side should fall, and the army\r\non the other side should be beaten. Decius, the plebeian consul, when he\r\nfound his troops wavering, called the chief pontiff, and after invoking\r\nthe gods to assist his cause, rushed into the thickest of the Latin\r\narmies, and was slain. The other consul, Torquatus, by a masterly use of\r\nhis reserve, gained the battle. Three-fourths of the Latin army were\r\nslain. The Latin cities, after this decisive victory, lost their\r\nindependence, and the Latin confederacy was dissolved, and Latin\r\nnationality was fused into one powerful State, and all Latium became\r\nRoman. Roman citizens settled on the forfeited lands of the conquered\r\ncities.\r\n\r\n(M818) The subjugation of Latium and the progress of Rome in Campania\r\nfilled the Samnites with jealousy, and it is surprising that they should\r\nhave formed an alliance with Rome, when Rome was conquering Campania. They\r\nwere the most considerable power in Italy, next to Rome, and to them fell\r\nthe burden of maintaining the independence of the Italian States against\r\nthe encroachments of the Romans.\r\n\r\n(M819) The Greek cities of Palæapolis and Neapolis, the only communities\r\nin Campania not yet reduced by the Romans, gave occasion to the outbreak\r\nof the inevitable war between the Samnites and Romans. The Tarentines and\r\nSamnites, informed of the intention of the Romans to seize these cities,\r\nanticipated the seizure, upon which the Romans declared war, and commenced\r\nthe siege of Palæapolis, which soon submitted, on the offer of favorable\r\nterms. An alliance of the Romans with the Lucanians, left the Samnites\r\nunsupported, except by tribes on the eastern mountain district. The Romans\r\ninvaded the Samnite territories, pillaging and destroying as far as\r\nApulia, on which the Samnites sent back the Roman prisoners and sought for\r\npeace. But peace was refused by the inexorable enemy, and the Samnites\r\nprepared for desperate resistance. They posted themselves in ambush at an\r\nimportant pass in the mountains, and shut up the Romans, who offered to\r\ncapitulate. Instead of accepting the capitulation and making prisoners of\r\nthe whole army, the Samnite general, Gaius Pontius, granted an equitable\r\npeace. But the Roman Senate, regardless of the oaths of their generals,\r\nand regardless of the six hundred equites who were left as hostages,\r\ncanceled the agreement, and the war was renewed with increased\r\nexasperation on the part of the Samnites, who, however, were sufficiently\r\nmagnanimous not to sacrifice the hostages they held. Rome sent a new army,\r\nunder Lucius Papirius Cursor, and laid siege to Lucania, where the Roman\r\nequites lay in captivity. The city surrendered, and Papirius liberated his\r\ncomrades, and retaliated on the Samnite garrison. The war continued, like\r\nall wars at that period between people of equal courage and resources,\r\nwith various success—sometimes gained by one party and sometimes by\r\nanother, until, in the fifteenth year of the war, the Romans established\r\nthemselves in Apulia, on one sea, and Campania, on the other.\r\n\r\nThe people of Northern and Central Italy, perceiving that the Romans aimed\r\nat the complete subjugation of the whole peninsula, now turned to the\r\nassistance of the Samnites. The Etruscans joined their coalition, but were\r\nat length subdued by Papirius Cursor. The Samnites found allies in the\r\nUmbrians of Northern, and the Marsi and Pieligni of Central Italy, But\r\nthese people were easily subdued, and a peace was made with Samnium, after\r\ntwenty-two years’ war, when Bovianum, its strongest city, was taken by\r\nstorm, B.C. 298.\r\n\r\n(M820) The defeated nations would not, however, submit to Rome without one\r\nmore final struggle, and the third Samnite war was renewed the following\r\nyear, for which the Samnites called to their aid the Gauls. This war\r\nlasted nine years, and was virtually closed by the great victory of\r\nSeutinum—a fiercely contested battle, where the Romans, though victorious,\r\nlost nine thousand men. Umbria submitted, the Gauls dispersed, and the\r\nEtruscans made a truce for four hundred months. The Samnites still made\r\ndesperate resistance, but were finally subdued in a decisive battle, where\r\ntwenty thousand were slain, and their great general, Pontius, was taken\r\nprisoner, with four thousand Samnites. This misfortune closed the war, but\r\nthe Samnites were not subjected to humiliating terms. The Romans, however,\r\nsullied their victories by the execution of C. Pontius, the Samnite\r\ngeneral, who had once spared the lives of two Roman armies, B.C. 291. Rome\r\nnow became the ruling State of Italy, but there were still two great\r\nnations unsubdued—the Etruscans in the north, and the Lucanians in the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n(M821) A new coalition arose against Rome, soon after the Samnites were\r\nsubdued, composed of Etruscans, Bruttians, and Lucanians. The war began in\r\nEtruria, B.C. 283, and continued with alternate successes, until the\r\ndecisive victory at the Vadimonian Lake, gained by G. Domitius Calvinus,\r\ndestroyed forever the power of the Etruscans. The attention of Rome was\r\nnow given to Tarentum, a Greek city, at the bottom of the gulf of that\r\nname, adjacent to the fertile plain of Lucania. This city, which was\r\npre-eminent among the States of Magna Grecia, had grown rich by commerce,\r\nand was sufficiently powerful to defend herself against the Etruscans and\r\nthe Syracusans. It was a Dorian colony, but had abandoned the Lacedæmonian\r\nsimplicity, and was given over to pleasure and luxury; but, luxurious as\r\nit was, it was the only obstacle to the supremacy of Rome over Italy.\r\n\r\n(M822) This thoughtless and enervated, but great city, ruled by\r\ndemagogues, had insulted Rome—burning and destroying some of her ships. It\r\nwas a reckless insult which Rome could not forget, prompted by fear as\r\nwell as hatred. When the Samnite war closed, the Tarentines, fearing the\r\nvengeance of the most powerful State in Italy, sent to Pyrrhus, king of\r\nEpirus, a soldier of fortune, for aid. They offered the supreme command of\r\ntheir forces, with the right to keep a garrison in their city, till the\r\nindependence of Italy was secured.\r\n\r\n(M823) Pyrrhus, who was compared with Alexander of Macedon, aspired to\r\nfound an Hellenic empire in the West, as Alexander did in the East, and\r\nresponded to the call of the Tarentines. Rome was not now to contend with\r\nbarbarians, but with Hellenes—with phalanxes and cohorts instead of a\r\nmilitia—with a military monarchy and sustained by military science. He\r\nlanded, B.C. 281, on the Italian shores, with an army of twenty thousand\r\nveterans in phalanx, two thousand archers, three thousand cavalry, and\r\ntwenty elephants. The Tarentine allies promised three hundred and fifty\r\nthousand infantry and twenty thousand cavalry to support him. The Romans\r\nstrained every nerve to meet him before these forces could be collected\r\nand organized. They marched with a force of fifty thousand men, larger\r\nthan a consular army, under Lævinius and Æmilius. They met the enemy on\r\nthe plain of Heraclea. Seven times did the legion and phalanx drive one or\r\nthe other back. But the reserves of Pyrrhus, with his elephants, to which\r\nthe Romans were unaccustomed, decided the battle. Seven thousand Romans\r\nwere left dead on the field, and an immense number were wounded or taken\r\nprisoners. But the battle cost Pyrrhus four thousand of his veterans,\r\nwhich led him to say that another such victory would be his ruin. The\r\nRomans retreated into Apulia, but the whole south of Italy, Lucania,\r\nSamnium, the Bruttii, and the Greek cities were the prizes which the\r\nconqueror won.\r\n\r\n(M824) Pyrrhus then offered peace, since he only aimed to establish a\r\nGreek power in Southern Italy. The Senate was disposed to accept it, but\r\nthe old and blind Appius Claudius was carried in his litter through the\r\ncrowded forum—as Chatham, in after times, bowed with infirmities and age,\r\nwas carried to the parliament—and in a vehement speech denounced the\r\npeace, and infused a new spirit into the Senate. The Romans refused to\r\ntreat with a foreign enemy on the soil of Italy. The ambassador of\r\nPyrrhus, the orator Cineas, returned to tell the conqueror that to fight\r\nthe Romans was to fight a hydra—that their city was a temple, and their\r\nsenators were kings.\r\n\r\n(M825) Two new legions were forthwith raised to re-enforce Lævinius, while\r\nPyrrhus marched direct to Rome. But when he arrived within eighteen miles,\r\nhe found an enemy in his front, while Lævinius harassed his rear. He was\r\nobliged to retreat, and retired to Tarentum with an immense booty. The\r\nnext year he opened the campaign in Apulia; but he found an enemy of\r\nseventy thousand infantry and eight thousand horse—a force equal to his\r\nown. The first battle was lost by the Romans, who could not penetrate the\r\nGrecian phalanx, and were trodden down by the elephants. But he could not\r\nprosecute his victory, his troops melted away, and he again retired to\r\nTarentum for winter quarters.\r\n\r\n(M826) Like a military adventurer, he then, for two years, turned his\r\nforces against the Carthaginians, and relieved Syracuse. But he did not\r\navail himself of his victories, being led by a generous nature into\r\npolitical mistakes. He then returned to Italy to renew his warfare with\r\nthe Romans. The battle of Beneventum, gained by Carius, the Roman general,\r\ndecided the fate of Pyrrhus. The flower of his Epirot troops was\r\ndestroyed, and his camp fell, with all its riches, into the hands of the\r\nRomans. The king of Epirus retired to his own country, and was\r\nassassinated by a woman at Argos, after he had wrested the crown of\r\nMacedonia from Antigonus, B.C. 272. He had left, however, to garrison,\r\nunder Milo, at Tarentum. The city fell into the hands of the Romans the\r\nyear that Pyrrhus died.\r\n\r\n(M827) With the fall of Tarentum, the conquest of Italy was complete. The\r\nRomans found no longer any enemies to resist them on the peninsula. A\r\ngreat State was organized for the future subjection of the world. The\r\nconquest of Italy greatly enriched the Romans. Both rich and poor became\r\npossessed of large grants of land from the conquered territories. The\r\nconquered cities were incorporated with the Roman State, and their\r\ninhabitants became Roman citizens or allies. The growth of great plebeian\r\nfamilies re-enforced the aristocracy, which was based on wealth. Italy\r\nbecame Latinized, and Rome was now acknowledged as one of the great powers\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n(M828) The great man at Rome during the period of the Samnite wars was\r\nAppius Claudius—great grandson of the decemvir, and the proudest\r\naristocrat that had yet appeared. He enjoyed all the great offices of\r\nState. To him we date many improvements in the city, also the highway\r\nwhich bears his name. He was the patron of art, of eloquence, and poetry.\r\nBut, at this period, all individual greatness was lost in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PUNIC WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nA contest greater than with Pyrrhus and the Greek cities, more memorable\r\nin its incidents, and more important in its consequences, now awaited the\r\nRomans. This was with Carthage, the greatest power, next to Rome, in the\r\nworld at that time—a commercial State which had been gradually aggrandized\r\nfor three hundred years. It was a rich and powerful city at the close of\r\nthe Persian wars. It had succeeded Tyre as the mistress of the sea.\r\n\r\n(M829) We have seen, in the second book, how the Carthaginians were\r\ninvolved in wars with Syracuse, when that city had reached the acme of its\r\npower under Dionysius. We have also alluded to the early history and power\r\nof Carthage. At the time Pyrrhus landed in Sicily, it contained nearly a\r\nmillion of people, and controlled the northern coast of Africa, and the\r\nwestern part of the Mediterranean. Carthage was strictly a naval power,\r\nalthough her colonies were numerous, and her dependencies large. The land\r\nforces were not proportionate to the naval; but large armies were\r\nnecessary to protect her dependencies in the constant wars in which she\r\nwas engaged. These armies were chiefly mercenaries, and their main\r\nstrength consisted in light cavalry.\r\n\r\n(M830) The territories of Carthage lay chiefly in the islands which were\r\nprotected by her navy and enriched by her commerce. Among these insular\r\npossessions, Sardinia was the largest and most important, and was the\r\ncommercial depot of Southern Europe. A part of Sicily, also, as we have\r\nseen (Book ii., chap. 24), was colonized and held by her, and she aimed at\r\nthe sovereignty of the whole island. Hence the various wars with Syracuse.\r\nThe Carthaginians and Greeks were the rivals for the sovereignty of this\r\nfruitful island, the centre of the oil and wine trade, the store-house for\r\nall sorts of cereals. Had Carthage possessed the whole of Sicily, her\r\nfleets would have controlled the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n(M831) The embroilment of Carthage with the Grecian States on this island\r\nwas the occasion of the first rupture with Rome. Messina, the seat of the\r\npirate republic of the Mamertines, was in close alliance with Rhegium, a\r\ncity which had grown into importance during the war with Pyrrhus. Rhegium,\r\nsituated on the Italian side of the strait, solicited the protection of\r\nRome, and a body of Campanian troops was sent to its assistance. These\r\ntroops expelled or massacred the citizens for whose protection they had\r\nbeen sent, and established a tumultuary government. On the fall of\r\nTarentum, the Romans sought to punish this outrage, and also to embrace\r\nthe opportunity to possess a town which would facilitate a passage to\r\nSicily, for Sicily as truly belonged to Italy as the Peloponnesus to\r\nGreece, being separated only by a narrow strait. A Roman army was\r\naccordingly sent to take possession of Rhegium, but the defenders made a\r\ndesperate resistance. It was finally taken by storm, and the original\r\ncitizens obtained repossession, as dependents and allies of Rome. The fall\r\nof Rhegium robbed the pirate city of Messina of the only ally on which it\r\ncould count, and subjected it to the vengeance of both the Carthaginians\r\nand the Syracusans. The latter were then under the sway of Hiero, who, for\r\nfifty years, had reigned without despotism, and had quietly developed both\r\nthe resources and the freedom of the city. He collected an army of\r\ncitizens, devoted to him, who expelled the Mamertines from many of their\r\ntowns, and gained a decisive victory over them, not far from Messina.\r\n\r\n(M832) The Mamertines, in danger of subjection by the Syracusans, then\r\nlooked for foreign aid. One party looked to Carthage, and another to Rome.\r\nThe Carthaginian party prevailed on the Mamertines to receive a Punic\r\ngarrison. The Romans, seeking a pretext for a war with Carthage, sent an\r\narmy ostensibly to protect Messina against Hiero. But the strait which\r\nafforded a passage to Sicily was barred by a Carthaginian fleet. The\r\nRomans, unaccustomed to the sea, were defeated. Not discouraged, however,\r\nthey finally succeeded in landing at Messina, and although Carthage and\r\nRome were at peace, seized Hanno, the Carthaginian general, who had the\r\nweakness to command the evacuation of the citadel as a ransom for his\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n(M833) On this violation of international law, Hiero, who feared the\r\nRomans more than the Carthaginians, made an alliance with Carthage, and\r\nthe combined forces of Syracuse and Carthage marched to the liberation of\r\nMessina. The Romans, under Appius, the consul, then made overtures of\r\npeace to the Carthaginians, and bent their energies against Hiero. But\r\nHiero, suspecting the Carthaginians of treachery, for their whole course\r\nwith the Syracusans for centuries had been treacherous, retired to\r\nSyracuse. Upon which the Romans attacked the Carthaginians singly, and\r\nrouted them, and spread devastation over the whole island.\r\n\r\nThis was the commencement of the first Punic war, in which the Romans were\r\nplainly the aggressors. Two consular armies now threatened Syracuse, when\r\nHiero sought peace, which was accepted on condition of provisioning the\r\nRoman armies, and paying one hundred talents to liberate prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe first Punic war began B.C. 264, and lasted twenty-four years. Before\r\nwe present the leading events of that memorable struggle, let us glance at\r\nthe power of Carthage—the formidable rival of Rome.\r\n\r\n(M834) As has been narrated, Carthage was founded upon a peninsula, or\r\nrocky promontory, sixty-five years before the foundation of Rome. The\r\ninhabitants of Carthage, descendants of Phœnicians, were therefore of\r\nSemitic origin. The African farmer was a Canaanite, and all the Canaanites\r\nlacked the instinct of political life. The Phœnicians thought of commerce\r\nand wealth, and not political aggrandizement. With half their power, the\r\nHellenic cities achieved their independence. Carthage was a colony of\r\nPhœnicians, and had their ideas. It lived to traffic and get rich. It was\r\nwashed on all sides, except the west, by the sea, and above the city, on\r\nthe western heights, was the citadel Byrsa, called so from the word βύρσα,\r\na hide, according to the legend that Dido, when she came to Africa, bought\r\nof the inhabitants as much land as could be encompassed by a bull’s hide,\r\nwhich she cut into thongs, and inclosed the territory on which she built\r\nthe citadel. The city grew to be twenty-three miles in circuit, and\r\ncontained seven hundred thousand people. It had two harbors, an outer and\r\ninner, the latter being surrounded by a lofty wall. A triple wall was\r\nerected across the peninsula, to protect it from the west, three miles\r\nlong, and between the walls were stables for three hundred elephants, four\r\nthousand horses, and barracks for two thousand infantry, with magazines\r\nand stores. In the centre of the inner harbor was an island, called\r\nCothon, the shores of which were lined with quays and docks for two\r\nhundred and twenty ships. The citadel, Byrsa, was two miles in circuit,\r\nand when it finally surrendered to the Romans, fifty thousand people\r\nmarched out of it. On its summit was the famous temple of Æsculapius. At\r\nthe northwestern angle of the city were twenty immense reservoirs, each\r\nfour hundred feet by twenty-eight, filled with water, brought by an\r\naqueduct at a distance of fifty-two miles. The suburb Megara, beyond the\r\ncity walls, but within those that defended the peninsula, was the site of\r\nmagnificent gardens and villas, which were adorned with every kind of\r\nGrecian art, for the Carthaginians were rich before Rome had conquered\r\neven Latium. This great city controlled the other Phœnician cities, part\r\nof Sicily, Numidia, Mauritania, Lybia—in short, the northern part of\r\nAfrica, and colonies in Spain and the islands of the western part of the\r\nMediterranean. The city alone could furnish in an exigency forty thousand\r\nheavy infantry, one thousand cavalry, and twenty thousand war chariots.\r\nThe garrison of the city amounted to twenty thousand foot and four\r\nthousand horse, and the total force which the city could command was more\r\nthan one hundred thousand men. The navy was the largest in the world, for,\r\nin the sea-fight with Regulus, it numbered three hundred and fifty ships,\r\ncarrying one hundred and fifty thousand men.\r\n\r\nSuch was this great power against which the Romans were resolved to\r\ncontend. It would seem that Carthage was willing that Rome should have the\r\nsovereignty of Italy, provided it had itself the possession of Sicily. But\r\nthis was what the Romans were determined to prevent. The object of\r\ncontention, then, between these two rivals, the one all-powerful by land\r\nand the other by sea, was the possession of Sicily.\r\n\r\n(M835) During the first three years of the war, the Romans made themselves\r\nmasters of all the island, except the maritime fortresses at its western\r\nextremity, Eryx and Panormus. Meanwhile the Carthaginians ravaged the\r\ncoasts of Italy, and destroyed its commerce. The Romans then saw that\r\nSicily could not be held without a navy as powerful as that of their\r\nrivals, and it was resolved to build at once one hundred and twenty ships.\r\nA Carthaginian quinquereme, wrecked on the Bruttian shore, furnished the\r\nmodel, the forests of Silo the timber, and the maritime cities of Italy\r\nand Greece, the sailors. In sixty days a fleet of one hundred and twenty\r\nships was built and ready for sea. The superior seamanship of the\r\nCarthaginians was neutralized by converting the decks into a battle-field\r\nfor soldiers. Each ship was provided with a long boarding-bridge, hinged\r\nup against the mast, to be let down on the prow, and fixed to the hostile\r\ndeck by a long spike, which projected from its end. The bridge was wide\r\nenough for two soldiers to pass abreast, and its sides were protected by\r\nbulwarks.\r\n\r\n(M836) The first encounter of the Romans with the Carthaginians resulted\r\nin the capture of the whole force, a squadron of seventeen ships. The\r\nsecond encounter ended in the capture of more ships than the Roman\r\nadmiral, Cn. Scipio, had lost. The next battle, that of Mylæ, in which the\r\nwhole Roman fleet was engaged, again turned in favor of the Romans, whose\r\nbad seamanship provoked the contempt of their foes, and led to\r\nself-confidence. The battle was gained by grappling the enemy’s ships one\r\nby one. The Carthaginians lost fourteen ships, and only saved the rest by\r\ninglorious flight.\r\n\r\n(M837) For six years no decided victories were won by either side, but in\r\nthe year B.C. 256, nine years from the commencement of hostilities, M.\r\nAtilius Regulus, a noble of the same class and habits as Cincinnatus and\r\nFabricius, with a fleet of three hundred and thirty ships, manned by one\r\nhundred thousand sailors, encountered the Carthaginian fleet of three\r\nhundred and fifty ships on the southern coast of Sicily, and gained a\r\nmemorable victory. It was gained on the same principle as Epaminondas and\r\nAlexander won their battles, by concentrating all the forces upon a single\r\npoint, and breaking the line. The Romans advanced in the shape of a wedge,\r\nwith the two consuls’ ships at the apex. The Carthaginian admirals allowed\r\nthe centre to give way before the advancing squadron. The right wing made\r\na circuit out in the open sea, and took the Roman reserve in the rear,\r\nwhile the left wing attacked the vessels that were towing the horse\r\ntransports, and forced them to the shore. But the Carthaginian centre,\r\nbeing thus left weak, was no match for the best ships of the Romans, and\r\nthe consuls, victorious in the centre, turned to the relief of the two\r\nrear divisions. The Carthaginians lost sixty-four ships, which were taken,\r\nbesides twenty-four which were sunk, and retreated with the remainder to\r\nthe Gulf of Carthage, to defend the shores against the anticipated attack.\r\n\r\n(M838) The Romans, however, made for another point, and landed in the\r\nharbor of Aspis, intrenched a camp to protect their ships, and ravaged the\r\ncountry. Twenty thousand captives were sent to Rome and sold as slaves,\r\nbesides an immense booty—a number equal to a fifth part of the free\r\npopulation of the city. A footing in Africa was thus made, and so secure\r\nwere the Romans, that a large part of the army was recalled, leaving\r\nRegulus with only forty ships, fifteen thousand infantry, and five hundred\r\ncavalry. Yet with this small army he defeated the Carthaginians, and\r\nbecame master of the country to within ten miles of Carthage. The\r\nCarthaginians, shut up in the city, sued for peace; but it was granted\r\nonly on condition of the cession of Sicily and Sardinia, the surrender of\r\nthe fleet, and the reduction of Carthage to the condition of a dependent\r\ncity. Such a proposal was rejected, and despair gave courage to the\r\ndefeated Carthaginians.\r\n\r\n(M839) They made one grand effort while Regulus lay inactive in winter\r\nquarters. The return of Hamilcar from Sicily with veteran troops, which\r\nfurnished a nucleus for a new army, inspired the Carthaginians with hope,\r\nand assisted by a Lacedæmonian general, Xanthippus, with a band of Greek\r\nmercenaries, the Carthaginians marched unexpectedly upon Regulus, and so\r\nsignally defeated him at Tunis, that only two thousand Romans escaped.\r\nRegulus, with five hundred of the legionary force, was taken captive and\r\ncarried to Carthage.\r\n\r\n(M840) The Carthaginians now assumed the offensive, and Sicily became the\r\nbattle-field. Hasdrubal, son of Hanno, landed on the island with one\r\nhundred and forty elephants, while the Roman fleet of three hundred ships\r\nsuffered a great disaster off the Lucanian promontory. A storm arose,\r\nwhich wrecked one hundred and fifty ships—a disaster equal to the one\r\nwhich it suffered two years before, when two-thirds of the large fleet\r\nwhich was sent to relieve the two thousand troops at Clupea was destroyed\r\nby a similar storm. In spite of these calamities, the Romans took Panormus\r\nand Thermæ, and gained a victory under the walls of the former city which\r\ncost the Carthaginians twenty thousand men and the capture of one hundred\r\nand twenty elephants. This success, gained by Metellus, was the greatest\r\nyet obtained in Sicily, and the victorious general adorned his triumph\r\nwith thirteen captured generals and one hundred and four elephants.\r\n\r\n(M841) The two maritime fortresses which still held out at the west of the\r\nisland, Drepanum and Lilybæum, were now invested, and the Carthaginians,\r\nshut up in these fortresses, sent an embassy to Rome to ask an exchange of\r\nprisoners, and sue for peace. Regulus, now five years a prisoner, was\r\nallowed to accompany the embassy, on his promise to return if the mission\r\nwas unsuccessful. As his condition was now that of a Carthaginian slave,\r\nhe was reluctant to enter the city, and still more the Senate, of which he\r\nwas no longer a member. But when this reluctance was overcome, he\r\ndenounced both the peace and the exchange of prisoners. The Romans wished\r\nto retain this noble patriot, but he was true to his oath, and returned\r\nvoluntarily to Carthage, after having defeated the object of the\r\nambassadors, knowing that a cruel death awaited him. The Carthaginians,\r\nindignant and filled with revenge, it is said, exposed the hero to a\r\nburning sun, with his eyelids cut off, and rolled him in a barrel lined\r\nwith iron spikes.\r\n\r\n(M842) The embassy having thus failed, the attack on the fortresses, which\r\nalone linked Africa with Sicily, was renewed. The siege of Lilybæum lasted\r\ntill the end of the war, which, from the mutual exhaustion of the parties,\r\nnow languished for six years. The Romans had lost four great fleets, three\r\nof which had arms on board, and the census of the city, in the seventeenth\r\nyear, showed a decrease of forty thousand citizens. During this interval\r\nof stagnation, when petty warfare alone existed, Hamilcar Burca was\r\nappointed general of Carthage, and in the same year his son Hannibal was\r\nborn, B.C. 247.\r\n\r\n(M843) The Romans, disgusted with the apathy of the government, fitted out\r\na fleet of privateers of two hundred ships, manned by sixty thousand\r\nsailors, and this fleet gained a victory over the Carthaginians,\r\nunprepared for such a force, so that fifty ships were sunk, and seventy\r\nmore were carried by the victors into port. This victory gave Sicily to\r\nthe Romans, and ended the war. The Roman prisoners were surrendered by\r\nHamilcar, who had full powers for peace, and Carthage engaged to pay three\r\nthousand two hundred talents for the expenses of the war.\r\n\r\n(M844) The Romans were gainers by this war. They acquired the richest\r\nisland in the world, fertile in all the fruits of the earth, with splendid\r\nharbors, cities, and a great accumulation of wealth. The long war of\r\ntwenty-four years, nearly a whole generation, was not conducted on such a\r\nscale as essentially to impoverish the contending parties. There were no\r\ndebts contracted for future generations to pay. It was the most absorbing\r\nobject of public interest, indeed; but many other events and subjects must\r\nalso have occupied the Roman mind. It was a foreign war, the first that\r\nRome had waged. It was a war of ambition, the commencement of those\r\nunscrupulous and aggressive measures that finally resulted in the\r\npolitical annihilation of all the other great powers of the world.\r\n\r\nBut this war, compared with those foreign wars which Rome subsequently\r\nconducted, was carried on without science and skill. It was carried on in\r\nthe transition period of Roman warfare, when tactics were more highly\r\nprized than strategy. It was by a militia, and agricultural generals, and\r\ntactics, and personal bravery, that the various Italian nations were\r\nsubdued, when war had not ripened into a science, such as was conducted\r\neven by the Greeks. There was no skill or experience in the conduct of\r\nsieges. The navy was managed by Greek mercenaries.\r\n\r\n(M845) The great improvement in the science of war which this first\r\ncontest with a foreign power led to, was the creation of a navy, and the\r\nnecessity of employing veteran troops, led by experienced generals. A\r\ndeliberative assembly, like the Senate, it was found could not conduct a\r\nforeign war. It was left to generals, who were to learn marches and\r\ncountermarches, sieges, and a strategical system. The withdrawal of half\r\nthe army of Regulus by the Senate proved nearly fatal. Carthage could not\r\nbe subdued by that rustic warfare which had sufficed for the conquest of\r\nEtruria or Samnium. The new system of war demanded generals who had\r\nmilitary training and a military eye, and not citizen admirals. The final\r\nsuccess was owing to the errors of the Carthaginians rather than military\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PUNIC OR HANNIBALIC WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peace between the Carthaginians and Romans was a mere truce. Though it\r\nlasted twenty-one years, new sources of quarrel were accumulating, and\r\nforces were being prepared for a more decisive encounter.\r\n\r\nBefore we trace the progress of this still more memorable war, let us\r\nglance at the events which transpired in the interval between it and the\r\nfirst contest.\r\n\r\n(M846) That interval is memorable for the military career of Hamilcar, and\r\nhis great ascendency at Carthage. That city paid dearly for the peace it\r\nhad secured, for the tribute of Sicily flowed into the treasury of the\r\nRomans. Its commercial policy was broken up, and the commerce of Italy\r\nflowed in new channels. This change was bitterly felt by the Phœnician\r\ncity, and a party was soon organized for the further prosecution of\r\nhostilities. There was also a strong peace party, made up of the indolent\r\nand cowardly money-worshipers of that mercantile State. The war party was\r\nheaded by Hamilcar, the peace party by Hanno, which at first had the\r\nascendency. It drove the army into mutiny by haggling about pay. The\r\nLibyan mercenaries joined the revolt, and Carthage found herself alone in\r\nthe midst of anarchies. In this emergency the government solicited\r\nHamilcar to save it from the effect of its blunders and selfishness.\r\n\r\n(M847) This government, as at Rome, was oligarchic, but the nobles were\r\nmerely mercantile grandees, without ability—jealous, exclusive, and\r\nselfish. The great body of the people whom they ruled were poor and\r\ndependent. In intrusting power to Hamilcar, the government of wealthy\r\ncitizens only gave him military control. The army which he commanded was\r\nnot a citizen militia, it was made up of mercenaries. Hamilcar was obliged\r\nto construct a force from these, to whom the State looked for its\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\nHe was a young man, a little over thirty, and foreboding that he would not\r\nlive to complete his plans, enjoined his son Hannibal, nine years of age,\r\nwhen he was about to leave Carthage, to swear at the altar of the Eternal\r\nGod hatred of the Roman name.\r\n\r\n(M848) He left Carthage for Spain, taking with him his sons, to be reared\r\nin the camp. He marched along the coast, accompanied by the fleet, which\r\nwas commanded by Hasdrubal. He crossed the sea at the Pillars of Hercules,\r\nwith the view of organizing a Spanish kingdom to assist the Carthaginians\r\nin their future warfare. But he died prematurely, B.C. 229, leaving his\r\nson-in-law, Hasdrubal, to carry out his designs, and the southern and\r\neastern provinces of Spain became Carthaginian provinces. Carthagena arose\r\nas the capital of this new Spanish kingdom, in the territory of the\r\nContestana. Here agriculture flourished, and still more, mining, from the\r\nsilver mines, which produced, a century afterward, thirty-six millions of\r\nsesterces—nearly two million dollars—yearly. Carthage thus acquired in\r\nSpain a market for its commerce and manufactures, and the New Carthage\r\nruled as far as the Ebro. But the greatest advantage of this new\r\nacquisition to Carthage was the new class of mercenary soldiers which were\r\nincorporated with the army. At first, the Romans were not alarmed by the\r\nrise of this new Spanish power, and saw only a compensation for the\r\ntribute and traffic which Carthage had lost in Sicily. And while the\r\nCarthaginians were creating armies in Spain, the Romans were engaged in\r\nconquering Cisalpine Gaul, and consolidating the Italian conquests.\r\n\r\n(M849) Hasdrubal was assassinated after eight years of successful\r\nadministration, and Hannibal was hailed as his successor by the army, and\r\nthe choice was confirmed by the Carthaginians, B.C. 221. He was now\r\ntwenty-nine, trained to all the fatigue and dangers of the camp, and with\r\na native genius for war, which made him, according to the estimation of\r\nmodern critics, the greatest general of antiquity. He combined courage\r\nwith discretion, and prudence with energy. He had an inventive craftiness,\r\nwhich led him to take unexpected routes. He profoundly studied the\r\ncharacter of antagonists, and kept himself informed of the projects of his\r\nenemies. He had his spies at Rome, and was frequently seen in disguises in\r\norder to get important information.\r\n\r\n(M850) This crafty and able general resolved, on his nomination, to make\r\nwar at once upon the Romans, whom he regarded as the deadly foe of his\r\ncountry. His first great exploit was the reduction of Saguntum, an Iberian\r\ncity on the coast, in alliance with the Romans. It defended itself with\r\ndesperate energy for eight months, and its siege is memorable. The\r\ninhabitants were treated with savage cruelty, and the spoil was sent to\r\nCarthage.\r\n\r\n(M851) This act of Hannibal was the occasion, though not the cause, of the\r\nsecond Punic war. The Romans, indignant, demanded of Carthage the\r\nsurrender of the general who had broken the peace. On the fall of\r\nSaguntum, Hannibal retired to Carthagena for winter quarters, and to make\r\npreparations for the invasion of Italy. He collected an army of one\r\nhundred and twenty thousand infantry, sixteen thousand cavalry, and\r\nfifty-eight elephants, assisted by a naval force. But the whole of this\r\ngreat army was not designed for the Italian expedition. A part of it was\r\nsent for the protection of Carthage, and a part was reserved for the\r\nprotection of Spain, the government of which he intrusted to his brother\r\nHasdrubal.\r\n\r\n(M852) The nations of the earth, two thousand years ago, would scarcely\r\nappreciate the magnitude of the events which were to follow from the\r\ninvasion of Italy, and the war which followed—perhaps “the most memorable\r\nof all the wars ever waged,” certainly one of the most memorable in human\r\nannals. The question at issue was, whether the world was to be governed by\r\na commercial oligarchy, with all the superstitions of the East, or by the\r\nlaws of a free and patriotic State. It was a war waged between the genius\r\nof a mighty general and the resources of the Roman people, for Hannibal\r\ndid not look for aid so much to his own State, as to those hardy Spaniards\r\nwho followed his standard.\r\n\r\n(M853) In the spring, B.C. 218, Hannibal set out from New Carthage with an\r\narmy of ninety thousand infantry and twelve thousand cavalry. He\r\nencountered at the Ebro the first serious resistance, but this was from\r\nthe natives, and not the Romans. It took four months to surmount their\r\nresistance, during which he lost one-fourth of his army. As it was his\r\ngreat object to gain time before the Romans could occupy the passes of the\r\nAlps, he made this sacrifice of his men. When he readied the Pyrenees, he\r\nsent home a part of his army, and crossed those mountains with only fifty\r\nthousand infantry and nine thousand cavalry; but these were veteran\r\ntroops. He took the coast route by Narbonne and Nimes, through the Celtic\r\nterritory, and encountered no serious resistance till he reached the\r\nRhone, opposite to Avignon, about the end of July. The passage was\r\ndisputed by Scipio, assisted by friendly Gauls, but Hannibal outflanked\r\nhis enemies by sending a detachment across the river, on rafts, two days’\r\nmarch higher up, and thus easily forced the passage, and was three days’\r\nmarch beyond the river before Scipio was aware that he had crossed. Scipio\r\nthen sailed back to Pisa, and aided his colleague to meet the invader in\r\nCisalpine Gaul.\r\n\r\n(M854) Hannibal, now on Celtic territory on the Roman side of the Rhone,\r\ncould not be prevented from reaching the Alps. Two passes then led from\r\nthe lower Rhone across the Alps—the one by the Cottian Alps (Mount\r\nGeneva); and the other, the higher pass of the Grain Alps (Mount St.\r\nBernard), and this was selected by Hannibal. The task of transporting a\r\nlarge army over even this easier pass was a work of great difficulty, with\r\nbaggage, cavalry, and elephants, when the autumn snows were falling,\r\nresisted by the mountaineers, against whom they had to fight to the very\r\nsummit of the pass. The descent, though free from enemies, was still more\r\ndangerous, and it required, at one place, three days’ labor to make the\r\nroad practicable for the elephants. The army arrived, the middle of\r\nSeptember, in the plain of Ivrea, where his exhausted troops were\r\nquartered in friendly villages. Had the Romans met him near Turin with\r\nonly thirty thousand men, and at once forced a battle, the prospects of\r\nHannibal would have been doubtful. But no army appeared; the object was\r\nattained, but with the loss of half his troops, and the rest so\r\ndemoralized by fatigue, that a long rest was required.\r\n\r\n(M855) The great talents by which Scipio atoned for his previous errors\r\nnow extricated his army from destruction. He retreated across the Ticinio\r\nand the Po, refusing a pitched battle on the plains, and fell back upon a\r\nstrong position on the hills. The united consular armies, forty thousand\r\nmen, were so posted as to compel Hannibal to attack in front with inferior\r\nforce, or go into winter quarters, trusting to the doubtful fidelity of\r\nthe Gauls.\r\n\r\n(M856) It has been well said, “that it was the misfortune of Rome’s double\r\nmagistracy when both consuls were present on the field.” Owing to a wound\r\nwhich Scipio had received, the command devolved upon Sempronius, who,\r\neager for distinction, could not resist the provocations of Hannibal to\r\nbring on a battle. In one of the skirmishes the Roman cavalry and light\r\ninfantry were enticed by the flying Numidians across a swollen stream, and\r\nsuddenly found themselves before the entire Punic army. The whole Roman\r\nforce hurried across the stream to support the vanguard. A battle took\r\nplace on the Trasimene Lake, in which the Romans were sorely beaten, but\r\nten thousand infantry cut their way through the masses of the enemy, and\r\nreached the fortress of Placentia, where they were joined by other bands.\r\nAfter this success, which gave Hannibal all of Northern Italy, his army,\r\nsuffering from fatigue and disease, retired into winter quarters. He now\r\nhad lost all his elephants but one. The remains of the Roman army passed\r\nthe winter in the fortresses of Placentia and Cremona.\r\n\r\n(M857) The next spring, the Romans, under Flaminius, took the field, with\r\nfour legions, to command the great northern and eastern roads, and the\r\npasses of the Appenines. But Hannibal, knowing that Rome was only\r\nvulnerable at the heart, rapidly changed his base, crossed the Appenines\r\nat an undefended pass, and advanced, by the lower Arno, into Etruria,\r\nwhile Flaminius was watching by the upper course of that stream. Flaminius\r\nwas a mere party leader and demagogue, and was not the man for such a\r\ncrisis, for Hannibal was allowed to pass by him, and reach Fæsulæ\r\nunobstructed. The Romans prepared themselves for the worst, broke down the\r\nbridges over the Tiber, and nominated Quintus Fabius Maximus dictator.\r\n\r\n(M858) Pyrrhus would have marched direct upon Rome, but Hannibal was more\r\nfar-sighted. His army needed a new organization, and rest, and recruits,\r\nso he marched unexpectedly through Umbria, devastated the country, and\r\nhalted on the shores of the Adriatic. Here he rested, reorganized his\r\nLibyan cavalry, and resumed his communication with Carthage. He then broke\r\nup his camp, and marched into Southern Italy, hoping to break up the\r\nconfederacy. But not a single Italian town entered into alliance with the\r\nCarthaginians.\r\n\r\n(M859) Fabius, the dictator, a man of great prudence, advanced in years,\r\nand a tactitian of the old Roman school, determined to avoid a pitched\r\nbattle, and starve or weary out his enemy. Hannibal adjusted his plans in\r\naccordance with the character of the man he opposed. So he passed the\r\nRoman army, crossed the Appenines, took Telesia, and turned against Capua,\r\nthe most important of all the Italian dependent cities, hoping for a\r\nrevolt among the Campanian towns. Here again he was disappointed. So,\r\nretracing his steps, he took the road to Apulia, the dictator following\r\nhim along the heights. So the summer was consumed by marchings and\r\ncounter-marchings, the lands of the Hispanians, Campamans, Samnites,\r\nPælignians, and other provinces, being successively devastated. But no\r\nimportant battle was fought. He selected then the rich lands of Apulia for\r\nwinter quarters, and intrenched his camp at Gerenium. The Romans formed a\r\ncamp in the territory of the Larinates, and harassed the enemy’s foragers.\r\nThis defensive policy of Fabius wounded the Roman pride, and the dictator\r\nbecame unpopular. The Senate resolved to depart from a policy which was\r\nslowly but surely ruining the State, and an army was equipped larger than\r\nRome ever before sent into the field, composed of eight legions, under the\r\ncommand of the two consuls, L. Æmilius Paulus, and M. Terentius Varro. The\r\nformer, a patrician, had conducted successfully the Illyrian war; the\r\nlatter, the popular candidate, incapable, conceited, and presumptuous.\r\n\r\n(M860) As soon as the season allowed him to leave his winter-quarters,\r\nHannibal, assuming the offensive, marched out of Gerenium, passed Luceria,\r\ncrossed the Aufidus, and took the citadel of Cannæ, which commanded the\r\nplain of Canusium. The Roman consuls arrived in Apulia in the beginning of\r\nthe summer, with eighty thousand infantry and six thousand cavalry.\r\nHannibal’s force was forty thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry,\r\ninured to regular warfare. The Romans made up their minds to fight, and\r\nconfronted the Carthaginians on the right bank of the Aufidus. According\r\nto a foolish custom, the command devolved on one of the consuls every\r\nother day, and Varro determined to avail himself of the first opportunity\r\nfor a battle. The forces met on the plain west of Cannæ, more favorable to\r\nthe Carthaginians than the Romans, on account of the superiority of the\r\ncavalry. It is difficult, without a long description, to give clear\r\nconceptions of this famous battle. Hannibal, it would seem, like\r\nEpaminondas and Alexander, brought to bear his heavy cavalry, under\r\nHasdrubal, upon the weakest point of the enemy, after the conflict had\r\ncontinued awhile without decisive results. The weaker right of the Roman\r\narmy, led by Paulus, after bravely fighting, were cut down and driven\r\nacross the river. Paulus, wounded, then rode to the centre, composed of\r\ninfantry in close lines, which had gained an advantage over the Spanish\r\nand Gaulish troops that encountered them. In order to follow up this\r\nadvantage, the legions pressed forward in the form of a wedge. In this\r\nposition the Libyan infantry, wheeling upon them right and left, warmly\r\nassailed both sides of the Roman infantry, which checked its advance. By\r\nthis double flank attack the Roman infantry became crowded, and were not\r\nfree. Meanwhile, Hasdrubal, after defeating the right wing, which had been\r\nled by Paulus, led his cavalry behind the Roman centre and attacked the\r\nleft wing, led by Varro. The cavalry of Varro, opposed by the Numidian\r\ncavalry, was in no condition to meet this double attack, and was\r\nscattered. Hasdrubal again rallied his cavalry, and led it to the rear of\r\nthe Roman centre, already in close fight with the Spanish and Gaulish\r\ninfantry. This last charge decided the battle. Flight was impossible, for\r\nthe river was in the rear, and in front was a victorious enemy. No quarter\r\nwas given. Seventy thousand Romans were slain, including the consul Paulus\r\nand eighty men of senatorial rank. Varro was saved by the speed of his\r\nhorse. The Carthaginians lost not quite six thousand.\r\n\r\n(M861) This immense disaster was the signal for the revolt of the allies,\r\nwhich Hannibal before in vain had sought to procure. Capua opened her\r\ngates to the conqueror. Nearly all the people of Southern Italy rose\r\nagainst Rome. But the Greek cities of the coast were held by Roman\r\ngarrisons, as well as the fortresses in Apulia, Campania, and Samnium. The\r\nnews of the battle of Cannæ, B.C. 216, induced the Macedonian king to\r\npromise aid to Hannibal. The death of Hiero at Syracuse made Sicily an\r\nenemy to Rome, while Carthage, now elated, sent considerable\r\nre-enforcements.\r\n\r\n(M862) Many critics have expressed surprise that Hannibal, after this\r\ngreat victory, did not at once march upon Rome. Had he conquered, as\r\nAlexander did, a Persian, Oriental, effeminate people, this might have\r\nbeen his true policy. But Rome was still capable of a strong defense, and\r\nwould not have succumbed under any pressure of adverse circumstances, and\r\nshe also was still strong in allies. And more, Hannibal had not perfected\r\nhis political combinations. He was not ready to strike the final blow. He\r\nhad to keep his eye on Macedonia, Africa, Sicily, and Spain. Alexander did\r\nnot march to Babylon, until he had subdued Phœnicia and Egypt. Even the\r\ncapture of Rome would not prevent a long war with the States of Italy.\r\n\r\n(M863) Nor did the Romans lose courage when they learned the greatest\r\ncalamity which had ever befallen them. They made new and immense\r\npreparations. All the reserve forces were called out—all men capable of\r\nbearing arms—young or old. Even the slaves were armed, after being\r\npurchased by the State, and made soldiers. Spoils were taken down from the\r\ntemples. The Latin cities sent in contingents, and the Senate refused to\r\nreceive even the envoy of the conqueror.\r\n\r\n(M864) Such courage and fortitude and energy were not without effect,\r\nwhile the enervating influence of Capua, the following winter, demoralized\r\nthe Carthaginians. The turning point of the war was the winter which\r\nfollowed the defeat at Cannæ. The great aim of Hannibal, in his expedition\r\nto Italy, had been to break up the Italian confederacy. After three\r\ncampaigns, that object was only imperfectly accomplished, in spite of his\r\nvictories, and he had a great frontier to protect. With only forty\r\nthousand men, he could not leave it uncovered, and advance to Rome. The\r\nRomans, too, learning wisdom, now appointed only generals of experience,\r\nand continued them in command.\r\n\r\n(M865) The animating soul of the new warfare was Marcus Claudius\r\nMarcellus, a man fifty years of age, who had received a severe military\r\ntraining, and performed acts of signal heroism. He was not a general to be\r\na mere spectator of the movements of the enemy from the hills, but to take\r\nhis position in fortified camps under the walls of fortresses. With the\r\ntwo legions saved from Cannæ, and the troops raised from Rome and Ostia,\r\nhe followed Hannibal to Campania, while other Roman armies were posted in\r\nother quarters.\r\n\r\nHannibal now saw that without great re-enforcements from Carthage, Spain,\r\nMacedonia, and Syracuse, he would be obliged to fight on the defensive.\r\nBut the Carthaginians sent only congratulations; the king of Macedonia\r\nfailed in courage; while the Romans intercepted supplies from Syracuse and\r\nSpain. Hannibal was left to his own resources.\r\n\r\n(M866) Scipio, meanwhile, in Spain, attacked the real base of Hannibal,\r\noverran the country of the Ebro, secured the passes of the Pyrenees, and\r\ndefeated Hasdrubal while attempting to lead succor to his brother. The\r\ncapture of Saguntum gave the Romans a strong fortress between the Ebro and\r\nCarthagena. Scipio even meditated an attack on Africa, and induced Syphax,\r\nking of one of the Numidian nations, to desert Carthage, which caused the\r\nrecall of Hasdrubal from Spain. His departure left Scipio master of the\r\npeninsula; but Hasdrubal, after punishing the disaffected Numidians,\r\nreturned to Spain, and with overwhelming numbers regained their\r\nascendency, and Scipio was slain, as well as his brother, and their army\r\nrouted.\r\n\r\n(M867) It has been mentioned that on the death of Hiero, who had been the\r\nlong-tried friend of Rome, Syracuse threw her influence in favor of\r\nCarthage, being ruled by factions. Against this revolted city the consul\r\nMarcellus now advanced, and invested the city by land and sea. He was\r\nfoiled by the celebrated mathematician Archimedes, who constructed engines\r\nwhich destroyed the Roman ships. This very great man advanced the science\r\nof geometry, and made discoveries which rank him among the lights of the\r\nancient world. His theory of the lever was the foundation of statics till\r\nthe time of Newton. His discovery of the method of determining specific\r\ngravities by immersion in a fluid was equally memorable. He was not only\r\nthe greatest mathematician of the old world, but he applied science to\r\npractical affairs, and compelled Marcellus to convert the siege of\r\nSyracuse into a blockade. He is said to have launched a ship by the\r\npressure of the screw, which, reversed in its operation, has\r\nrevolutionized naval and commercial marines.\r\n\r\n(M868) The time gained by this eminent engineer, as well as geometer,\r\nenabled the Carthaginians to send an army to relieve Syracuse. The\r\nsituation of Marcellus was critical, when, by a fortunate escalade of the\r\nwalls, left unguarded at a festival, the Romans were enabled to take\r\npossession of a strong position within the walls. A pestilence carried off\r\nmost of the African army encamped in the valley of Anapus, with the\r\ngeneral Himilco. Bomilcar, the Carthaginian admiral, retreated, rather\r\nthan fight the Roman fleet. Marcellus obtained, by the treachery of a\r\nSicilian captain, possession of the island of Ortygia, where Dionysius had\r\nonce intrenched himself, the key to the port and the city, and Syracuse\r\nfell. The city was given up to plunder and massacre, and Archimedes was\r\none of the victims. Marcellus honored the illustrious defender with a\r\nstately funeral, and he was buried outside the gate of Aeradina. One\r\nhundred and fifty years later, the Syracusans had forgotten even where he\r\nwas buried, and his tomb was discovered by Cicero.\r\n\r\n(M869) While these events took place in Spain and Sicily, Hannibal bent\r\nhis efforts to capture Tarentum, and the Romans were equally resolved to\r\nrecover Capua. The fall of Tarentum enabled Hannibal to break up the siege\r\nof Capua, and foiled in his attempts to bring on a decisive battle before\r\nthat city, he advanced to Rome, and encamped within five miles of the\r\ncity, after having led his troops with consummate skill between the armies\r\nand fortresses of the enemy. But Rome was well defended by two legions,\r\nunder Fabius, who refused to fight a pitched battle. Hannibal was,\r\ntherefore, compelled to retreat in order to save Capua, which, however, in\r\nhis absence, had surrendered to the Romans, after a two years’ siege, and\r\nwas savagely punished for its defection from the Roman cause. The fall of\r\nCapua gave a renewed confidence to the Roman government, which sent\r\nre-enforcements to Spain. But it imprudently reduced its other forces, so\r\nthat Marcellus was left to face Hannibal with an inadequate army. The war\r\nwas now carried on with alternate successes, in the course of which\r\nTarentum again fell into Roman hands. Thirty thousand Tarentines were sold\r\nas slaves, B.C. 209.\r\n\r\n(M870) This great war had now lasted ten years, and both parties were\r\nsinking from exhaustion. In this posture of affairs the Romans were\r\nstartled with the intelligence that Hasdrubal had crossed the Pyrenees,\r\nand was advancing to join his brother in Italy. The Romans, in this\r\nexigency, made prodigious exertions. Twenty-three legions were enrolled;\r\nbut before preparations were completed, Hasdrubal crossed the Alps,\r\nre-enforced by eight thousand Ligurian mercenaries. It was the aim of the\r\ntwo Carthaginian generals to form a juncture of their forces, and of the\r\nRomans to prevent it. Gaining intelligence of the intended movements of\r\nHannibal and Hasdrubal by an intercepted dispatch, the Roman consul, Nero,\r\nadvanced to meet Hasdrubal, and encountered him on the banks of the\r\nMetaurus. Here a battle ensued, in which the Carthaginians were defeated\r\nand Hasdrubal slain. Hannibal was waiting in suspense for the dispatch of\r\nhis brother in his Apulian camp, when the victor returned from his march\r\nof five hundred miles, and threw the head of Hasdrubal within his\r\noutposts, On the sight of his brothers head, he exclaimed; “I recognize\r\nthe doom of Carthage.” Abandoning Apulia and Lucania, he retired to the\r\nBruttian peninsula, and the victor of Cannæ retained only a few posts to\r\nre-embark for Africa.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this great general was able to keep the field four years longer,\r\nnor could the superiority of his opponents compel him to shut himself up\r\nin a fortress or re-embark, a proof of his strategic talents.\r\n\r\n(M871) In the mean time a brilliant career was opened in Spain to the\r\nyoung Publius Scipio, known as the elder Africanus. He was only\r\ntwenty-four when selected to lead the armies of Rome in Spain; for it was\r\nnecessary to subdue that country in order to foil the Carthaginians in\r\nItaly. Publius Scipio was an enthusiast, who won the hearts of soldiers\r\nand women. He was kingly in his bearing, confident of his greatness,\r\ngraceful in his manners, and eloquent in his speech—popular with all\r\nclasses, and inspiring the enthusiasm which he felt.\r\n\r\n(M872) He landed in Spain with an army of thirty thousand, and at once\r\nmarched to New Carthage, before the distant armies of the Carthaginians\r\ncould come to its relief. In a single day the schemes of Hamilcar and his\r\nsons were dissolved, and this great capital fell into the hands of the\r\nyouthful general, not yet eligible for a single curule magistracy. Ten\r\nthousand captives were taken and six hundred talents, with great stores of\r\ncorn and munitions of war. Spain seemed to be an easy conquest; but the\r\nfollowing year the Carthaginians made a desperate effort, and sent to\r\nSpain a new army of seventy thousand infantry, four thousand horse, and\r\nthirty-two elephants. Yet this great force, united with that which\r\nremained under Hasdrubal and Mago, was signally defeated by Scipio. This\r\ngrand victory, which made Scipio master of Spain, left him free to carry\r\nthe war into Africa itself, assisted by his ally Masinassa. Gades alone\r\nremained to the Carthaginians, the original colony of the Phœnicians, and\r\neven this last tie was severed when Mago was recalled to assist Hannibal.\r\n\r\n(M873) Scipio, ambitious to finish the war, and seeking to employ the\r\nwhole resources of the empire, returned to Italy and offered himself for\r\nthe consulship, B.C. 205, and was unanimously chosen by the centuries,\r\nthough not of legal age. His colleague was the chief pontiff P. Licinius\r\nCrassus, whose office prevented him from leaving Italy, and he was thus\r\nleft unobstructed in the sole conduct of the war. Sicily was assigned to\r\nhim as his province, where he was to build a fleet and make preparations\r\nfor passing over to Africa, although a party, headed by old Fabius\r\nMaximus, wished him to remain in Italy to drive away Hannibal. The Senate\r\nwithheld the usual power of the consul to make a new levy, but permitted\r\nScipio to enroll volunteers throughout Italy. In the state of\r\ndisorganization and demoralization which ever attend a long war, this\r\nenrollment was easily effected, and money was raised by contributions on\r\ndisaffected States.\r\n\r\n(M874) Hannibal was still pent up among the Bruttii, unwilling to let go\r\nhis last hold on Italy. Mago, in cisalpine Gaul, was too far off to render\r\naid. The defense of Africa depended on him alone, and he was recalled. He\r\nwould probably have anticipated the order. Rome breathed more freely when\r\nthe “Libyan Lion” had departed. For fifteen years he had been an incubus\r\nor a terror, and the Romans, in various conflicts, had lost three hundred\r\nthousand men. Two of the Scipios, Paulus Gracchus and Marcellus, had\r\nyielded up their lives in battle. Only Fabius, among the experienced\r\ngenerals at the beginning of the war, was alive, and he, at the age of\r\nninety, was now crowned with a chaplet of the grass of Italy, as the most\r\nhonorable reward which could be given him.\r\n\r\n(M875) Hannibal now sought a conference with Scipio, for both parties were\r\nanxious for peace, but was unable to obtain any better terms than the\r\ncession of Spain, as well as the Mediterranean islands, the surrender of\r\nthe Carthaginian fleet, the payment of four thousand talents, and the\r\nconfirmation of Masinissa in the kingdom of Syphax. Such terms could not\r\nbe accepted, and both parties prepared for one more decisive conflict.\r\n\r\n(M876) The battle was fought at Zama. “Hannibal arranged his infantry in\r\nthree lines. The first division contained the Carthaginian mercenaries;\r\nthe second, the African allies, and the militia of Carriage; the third,\r\nthe veterans who followed him from Italy. In the front of the lines were\r\nstationed eighty elephants; the cavalry was placed on the wings. Scipio\r\nlikewise disposed the legions in three divisions. The infantry fought hand\r\nto hand in the first division, and both parties falling into confusion,\r\nsought aid in the second division. The Romans were supported, but the\r\nCarthaginian militia was wavering. Upon seeing this, Hannibal hastily\r\nwithdrew what remained of the two first lines to the flanks, and pushed\r\nforward his choice Italian troops along the whole line. Scipio gathered\r\ntogether in the centre all that were able to fight of the first line, and\r\nmade the second and third divisions close up on the right and left of the\r\nfirst. Once again the conflict was renewed with more desperate fighting,\r\ntill the cavalry of the Romans and of Masinassa, returning from pursuit of\r\nthe beaten cavalry of the enemy, surrounded them on all sides. This\r\nmovement annihilated the Punic army. All was lost, and Hannibal was only\r\nable to escape with a handful of men.”\r\n\r\n(M877) It was now in the power of Scipio to march upon Carthage and lay\r\nsiege to the city, neither protected nor provisioned. But he made no\r\nextravagant use of his victory. He granted peace on the terms previously\r\nrejected, with the addition of an annual tribute of two hundred talents\r\nfor fifty years. He had no object to destroy a city after its political\r\npower was annihilated, and wickedly overthrow the primitive seat of\r\ncommerce, which was still one of the main pillars of civilization. He was\r\ntoo great and wise a statesman to take such a revenge as the Romans sought\r\nfifty years afterward. He was contented to end the war gloriously, and see\r\nCarthage, the old rival, a tributary and broken power, with no possibility\r\nof reviving its former schemes, B.C. 201.\r\n\r\n(M878) This ended the Hannibalic war, which had lasted seventeen years,\r\nand which gave to Rome the undisputed sovereignty of Italy, the conversion\r\nof Spain into two Roman provinces, the union of Syracuse with the Roman\r\nprovince of Sicily, the establishment of a Roman protectorate over the\r\nNumidian chiefs, and the reduction of Carthage to a defenseless mercantile\r\ncity. The hegemony of Rome was established over the western region of the\r\nMediterranean. These results were great, but were obtained by the loss of\r\none quarter of the burgesses of Rome, the ruin of four hundred towns, the\r\nwaste of the accumulated capital of years, and the general demoralization\r\nof the people. It might seem that the Romans could have lived side by side\r\nwith other nations in amity, as modern nations do. But, in ancient times,\r\n“it was necessary to be either anvil or hammer.” Either Rome or Carthage\r\nwas to become the great power of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MACEDONIAN AND ASIATIC WARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely was Rome left to recover from the exhaustion of the long and\r\ndesperate war with Hannibal, before she was involved in a new war with\r\nMacedonia, which led to very important consequences.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks had retained the sovereignty which Alexander had won, and their\r\ncivilization extended rapidly into the East. There were three great\r\nmonarchies which arose, however, from the dismemberment of the empire\r\nwhich Alexander had founded—Macedonia, Asia, and Egypt—and each of them,\r\nin turn, was destined to become provinces of Rome.\r\n\r\n(M879) Macedonia was then ruled by Philip V., and was much such a monarchy\r\nas the first Philip had consolidated. The Macedonian rule embraced Greece\r\nand Thessaly, and strong garrisons were maintained at Demetrias in\r\nMaguesia, Calchis in the island of Eubœa, and in Corinth, “the three\r\nfetters of the Hellenes.” But the strength of the kingdom lay in\r\nMacedonia. In Greece proper all moral and political energy had fled, and\r\nthe degenerate, but still intellectual inhabitants spent their time in\r\nbacchanalian pleasures, in fencing, and in study of the midnight lamp. The\r\nGreeks, diffused over the East, disseminated their culture, but were only\r\nin sufficient numbers to supply officers, statesmen, and schoolmasters.\r\nAll the real warlike vigor remained among the nations of the North, where\r\nPhilip reigned, a genuine king, proud of his purple, and proud of his\r\naccomplishments, lawless and ungodly, indifferent to the lives and\r\nsufferings of others, stubborn and tyrannical. He saw with regret the\r\nsubjugation of Carthage, but did not come to her relief when his aid might\r\nhave turned the scale, ten years before. His eyes were turned to another\r\nquarter, to possess himself of part of the territories of Egypt, assisted\r\nby Antiochus of Asia. In this attempt he arrayed against himself all the\r\nGreek mercantile cities whose interests were identified with Alexandria,\r\nnow, on the fall of Carthage, the greatest commercial city of the world.\r\nHe was opposed by Pergamus and the Rhodian league, while the Romans gave\r\nserious attention to their Eastern complications, not so much with a view\r\nof conquering the East, as to protect their newly-acquired possessions. A\r\nMacedonian war, then, became inevitable, but was entered into reluctantly,\r\nand was one of the most righteous, according to Mommsen, which Rome ever\r\nwaged.\r\n\r\n(M880) The pretext for war—the _casus belli_—was furnished by an attack on\r\nAthens by the Macedonian general, to avenge the murder of two Arcanians\r\nfor intruding upon the Eleusinan Mysteries, B.C. 201. Athens was an ally\r\nof Rome. Two legions, under Publius Sulpicius Galba, embarked at\r\nBrundusium for Macedonia, with one thousand Numidian cavalry and a number\r\nof elephants. Nothing was accomplished this year of any historical\r\nimportance. The next spring Galba led his troops into Macedonia, and\r\nencountered the enemy, under Philip, on a marshy plain on the northwest\r\nfrontier. But the Macedonians avoided battle, and after repeated\r\nskirmishes and marches the Romans returned to Apollonia. Philip did not\r\ndisturb the army in its retreat, but turned against the Ætolians, who had\r\njoined the league against him. At the end of the campaign the Romans stood\r\nas they were in the spring, but would have been routed had not the\r\nÆtolians interposed. The successes of Philip filled him with arrogance and\r\nself-confidence, and the following spring he assumed the offensive. The\r\nRomans, meantime, had been re-enforced by new troops, under the command of\r\nFlaminius, who attacked Philip in his intrenched camp. The Macedonian king\r\nlost his camp and two thousand men, and retreated to the Pass of Tempe,\r\nthe gate of Macedonia proper, deserted by many of his allies. The Achæans\r\nentered into alliance with Rome. The winter came on, and Philip sought\r\nterms of peace. All he could obtain from Flaminius was an armistice of two\r\nmonths. The Roman Senate refused all terms unless Philip would renounce\r\nall Greece, especially Corinth, Chalcis, and Demetrias. These were\r\nrejected, and Philip strained all his energies to meet his enemy in a\r\npitched battle. He brought into the field twenty-six thousand men, an\r\nequal force to the Romans, and encountered them at Cynocephalæ. The Romans\r\nwere victorious, and a great number of prisoners fell into their hands.\r\nPhilip escaped to Larissa, burned his papers, evacuated Thessaly, and\r\nreturned home. He was completely vanquished, and was obliged to accept\r\nsuch a peace as the Romans were disposed to grant. But the Romans did not\r\nabuse their power, but treated Philip with respect, and granted to him\r\nsuch terms as had been given to Carthage. He lost all his foreign\r\npossessions in Asia Minor, Thrace, Greece, and the islands of the Ægean,\r\nbut retained Macedonia. He was also bound not to conclude foreign\r\nalliances without the consent of the Romans, nor send garrisons abroad,\r\nnor maintain an army of over five thousand men, nor possess a navy beyond\r\nfive ships of war. He was also required to pay a contribution of one\r\nthousand talents. He was thus left in possession only of as much power as\r\nwas necessary to guard the frontiers of Hellas against the barbarians. All\r\nthe States of Greece were declared free, and most of them were\r\nincorporated with the Achæan League, a confederation of the old cities,\r\nwhich were famous before the Dorian migration, to resist the Macedonian\r\ndomination. This famous league was the last struggle of Greece for\r\nfederation to resist overpowering foes. As the Achæan cities were the\r\ndominant States of Greece at the Trojan war, so the expiring fires of\r\nGrecian liberty went out the last among that ancient race.\r\n\r\n(M881) The liberator of Greece, as Flaminius may be called, assembled the\r\ndeputies of all the Greek communities at Corinth, exhorted them to use the\r\nfreedom which he had conferred upon them with moderation, and requested,\r\nas the sole return for the kindness which the Romans had shown, that they\r\nwould send back all the Italian captives sold in Greece during the war\r\nwith Hannibal, and then he evacuated the last fortresses which he held,\r\nand returned to Rome with his troops and liberated captives. Rome really\r\ndesired the liberation and independence of Greece, now that all fears of\r\nher political power were removed, and that glorious liberty which is\r\nassociated with the struggles of the Greeks with the Persians might have\r\nbeen secured, had not the Hellenic nations been completely demoralized.\r\nThere was left among them no foundation and no material for liberty, and\r\nnothing but the magic charm of the Hellenic name could have prevented\r\nFlaminius from establishing a Roman government in that degenerate land. It\r\nwas an injudicious generosity which animated the Romans, but for which the\r\nwar with Antiochus might not have arisen.\r\n\r\n(M882) Antiochus III., the great-great-grandson of the general of\r\nAlexander who founded the dynasty of the Seleucidæ, then reigned in Asia.\r\nOn the fall of Philip, who was his ally, he took possession of those\r\ndistricts in Asia Minor that formerly belonged to Egypt, but had fallen to\r\nPhilip. He also sought to recover the Greek cities of Asia Minor as a part\r\nof his empire. This enterprise embroiled him with the Romans, who claimed\r\na protectorate over all the Hellenic cities. And he was further\r\ncomplicated by the arrival at Ephesus, his capital, of Hannibal, to whom\r\nhe gave an honorable reception. A rupture with Rome could not be avoided.\r\n\r\n(M883) To strengthen himself in Asia for the approaching conflict,\r\nAntiochus married one of his daughters to Ptolemy, king of Egypt, another\r\nto the king of Cappadocia, a third to the king of Pergamus, while the\r\nGrecian cities were amused by promises and presents. He was also assured\r\nof the aid of the Ætolians, who intrigued against the Romans as soon as\r\nFlaminius had left. Then was seen the error of that general for\r\nwithdrawing garrisons from Greece, which was to be the theatre of the war.\r\n\r\n(M884) Antiochus collected an army and started for Greece, hoping to be\r\njoined by Philip, who, however, placed all his forces at the disposal of\r\nthe Romans. The Achæan League also was firm to the Roman cause. The Roman\r\narmies sent against him, commanded by Maninius Acilius Glabrio, numbered\r\nforty thousand men. Instead of retiring before this superior force,\r\nAntiochus intrenched himself in Thermopylæ, but his army was dispersed,\r\nand he fled to Chalcis, and there embarked for Ephesus. The war was now to\r\nbe carried to Asia.\r\n\r\n(M885) Both parties, during the winter, vigorously prepared for the next\r\ncampaign, and the conqueror of Zama was selected by Rome to conduct her\r\narmies in Asia. It was a long and weary march for the Roman armies to the\r\nHellespont, which was crossed, however, without serious obstacles, from\r\nthe mismanagement of Antiochus, who offered terms of peace when the army\r\nhad safely landed in Asia. He offered to pay half the expenses of the war\r\nand the cession of his European possessions, as well as of the Greek\r\ncities of Asia Minor that had gone over to the Romans. But Scipio demanded\r\nthe whole cost of the war and the cession of Asia Minor. These terms were\r\nrejected, and the Syrian king hastened to decide the fate of Asia by a\r\npitched battle.\r\n\r\n(M886) This fight was fought at Magnesia, B.C. 190, not far from Smyrna,\r\nin the valley of the Hermus. The forces of Antiochus were eighty thousand,\r\nincluding twelve thousand cavalry, but were undisciplined and unwieldy.\r\nThose of Scipio were about half as numerous. The Romans were completely\r\nsuccessful, losing only twenty-four horsemen and three hundred infantry,\r\nwhereas the loss of Antiochus was fifty thousand—a victory as brilliant as\r\nthat of Alexander at Issus. Asia Minor was surrendered to the Romans, and\r\nAntiochus was compelled to pay three thousand talents (little more than\r\nthree million dollars) at once, and the same contribution for twelve\r\nyears, so that he retained nothing but Cilicia. His power was broken\r\nutterly, and he was prohibited from making aggressive war against the\r\nStates of the West, or from navigating the sea west of the mouth of the\r\nCalycadnus, in Cilicia, with armed ships, or from taming elephants, or\r\neven receiving political fugitives. The province of Syria never again made\r\na second appeal to the decision of arms—a proof of the feeble organization\r\nof the kingdom of the Seleucidæ.\r\n\r\n(M887) The king of Cappadocia escaped with a fine of six hundred talents.\r\nAll the Greek cities which had joined the Romans had their liberties\r\nconfirmed. The Ætolians lost all cities and territories which were in the\r\nhands of their adversaries. But Philip and the Achæans were disgusted with\r\nthe small share of the spoil granted to them.\r\n\r\n(M888) Thus the protectorate of Rome now embraced all the States from the\r\neastern to the western end of the Mediterranean. And Rome, about this\r\ntime, was delivered of the last enemy whom she feared—the homeless and\r\nfugitive Carthaginian, who lived long enough to see the West subdued, as\r\nwell as the armies of the East overpowered. At the age of seventy six he\r\ntook poison, on seeing his house beset with assassins. For fifty years he\r\nkept the oath he had sworn as a boy. About the same time that he killed\r\nhimself in Bithynia, Scipio, on whom fortune had lavished all her honors\r\nand successes—who had added Spain, Africa, and Asia to the empire, died in\r\nvoluntary banishment, little over fifty years of age, leaving orders not\r\nto bury his remains in the city for which he had lived, and where his\r\nancestors reposed. He died in bitter vexation from the false charges made\r\nagainst him of corruption and embezzlement, with hardly any other fault\r\nthan that overweening arrogance which usually attends unprecedented\r\nsuccess, and which corrodes the heart when the _èclat_ of prosperity is\r\ndimmed by time. The career and death of both these great men—the greatest\r\nof their age—shows impressively the vanity of all worldly greatness, and\r\nis an additional confirmation of the fact that the latter years of\r\nillustrious men are generally sad and gloomy, and certain to be so when\r\ntheir lives are not animated by a greater sentiment than that of ambition.\r\n\r\n(M889) Philip of Macedon died, B.C. 179, in the fifty-ninth year of his\r\nage and the forty-second of his reign, and his son Perseus succeeded to\r\nhis throne at the age of thirty-one. Macedonia had been humbled rather\r\nthan weakened by the Romans, and after eighteen years of peace, had\r\nrenewed her resources. This kingdom chafed against the foreign power of\r\nRome, as did the whole Hellenic world. A profound sentiment of discontent\r\nexisted in both Asia and Europe. Perseus made alliances with the\r\ndiscontented cities—with the Byzantines, the Ætolians, and the Bœotians.\r\nBut so prudently did he conduct his intrigues, that it was not till the\r\nseventh year of his reign that Rome declared war against him.\r\n\r\n(M890) The resources of Macedonia were still considerable. The army\r\nconsisted of thirty thousand men, without considering mercenaries or\r\ncontingents, and great quantities of military stores had been collected in\r\nthe magazines. And Perseus himself was a monarch of great ability, trained\r\nand disciplined to war. He collected an army of forty-three thousand men,\r\nwhile the whole Roman force in Greece was scarcely more. Crassus conducted\r\nthe Roman army, and in the first engagement at Ossa, was decidedly beaten.\r\nPerseus then sought peace, but the Romans never made peace after a defeat.\r\nThe war continued, but the military result of two campaigns was null,\r\nwhile the political result was a disgrace to the Romans. The third\r\ncampaign, conducted by Quintus Marcius Philippus, was equally undecisive,\r\nand had Perseus been willing to part with his money, he could have\r\nobtained the aid of twenty thousand Celts who would have given much\r\ntrouble. At last, in the fourth year of the war, the Romans sent to\r\nMacedonia Lucius Æmilius Paulus, son of the consul that fell at Cannæ—an\r\nexcellent general and incorruptible; a man sixty years of age, cultivated\r\nin Hellenic literature and art. Soon after his arrival at the camp at\r\nHeracleum, he brought about the battle of Pydna, which settled the fate of\r\nMacedonia. The overthrow of the Macedonians was fearful. Twenty thousand\r\nwere killed and eleven thousand made prisoners. All Macedonia submitted in\r\ntwo days, and the king fled with his gold, some six thousand talents he\r\nhad hoarded, to Samothrace, accompanied with only a few followers. The\r\nPersian monarch might have presented a more effectual resistance to\r\nAlexander had he scattered his treasures among the mercenary Greeks. So\r\nPerseus could have prolonged his contest had he employed the Celts. When a\r\nman is struggling desperately for his life or his crown, his treasures are\r\nof secondary importance. Perseus was soon after taken prisoner by the\r\nRomans, with all his treasures, and died a few years later at Alba.\r\n\r\n(M891) “Thus perished the empire of Alexander, which had subdued and\r\nHellenized the East, one hundred and forty-four years from his death.” The\r\nkingdom of Macedonia was stricken out of the list of States, and the whole\r\nland was disarmed, and the fortress of Demetrias was razed. Illyria was\r\ntreated in a similar way, and became a Roman province. All the Hellenic\r\nStates were reduced to dependence upon Rome. Pergamus was humiliated.\r\nRhodes was deprived of all possessions on the main land, although the\r\nRhodians had not offended. Egypt voluntarily submitted to the Roman\r\nprotectorate, and the whole empire of Alexander the Great fell to the\r\nRoman commonwealth. The universal empire of the Romans dates from the\r\nbattle of Pydna—“the last battle in which a civilized State confronted\r\nRome in the field on the footing of equality as a great power.” All\r\nsubsequent struggles were with barbarians. Mithridates, of Pontus, made\r\nsubsequently a desperate effort to rid the Oriental world of the dominion\r\nof Rome, but the battle of Pydna marks the real supremacy of the Romans in\r\nthe civilized world. Mommsen asserts that it is a superficial view which\r\nsees in the wars of the Romans with tribes, cities, and kings, an\r\ninsatiable longing after dominion and riches, and that it was only a\r\ndesire to secure the complete sovereignty of Italy, unmolested by enemies,\r\nwhich prompted, to this period, the Roman wars—that the Romans earnestly\r\nopposed the introduction of Africa, Greece, and Asia into the pale of\r\nprotectorship, till circumstances compelled the extension of that\r\npale—that, in fact, they were driven to all their great wars, with the\r\nexception of that concerning Sicily, even those with Hannibal and\r\nAntiochus, either by direct aggression or disturbance of settled political\r\nrelations. “The policy of Rome was that of a narrow-minded but very able\r\ndeliberate assembly, which had far too little power of grand combination,\r\nand far too much instinctive desire for the preservation of its own\r\ncommonwealth, to devise projects in the spirit of a Cæsar or a Napoleon.”\r\nNor did the ancient world know of a balance of power among nations, and\r\nhence every nation strove to subdue its neighbors, or render them\r\npowerless, like the Grecian States. Had the Greeks combined for a great\r\npolitical unity, they might have defied even the Roman power, or had they\r\nbeen willing to see the growth of equal States without envy, like the\r\nmodern nations of Europe, without destructive conflicts, the States of\r\nSparta, Corinth, and Athens might have grown simultaneously, and united,\r\nwould have been too powerful to be subdued. But they did not understand\r\nthe balance of power, and they were inflamed with rival animosities, and\r\nthus destroyed each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD PUNIC WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peace between Carthage and Rome, after the second Punic war, lasted\r\nfifty years, during which the Carthaginians gave the Romans no cause of\r\ncomplaint. Carthage, in the enjoyment of peace, devoted itself to commerce\r\nand industrial arts, and grew very rich and populous. The government alone\r\nwas weak, from the anarchical ascendency of the people, who were lawless\r\nand extravagant.\r\n\r\n(M892) Their renewed miseries can be traced to Masinissa, who was in close\r\nalliance with the Romans. The Carthaginians endured everything rather than\r\nprovoke the hostility of Rome, which watched the first opportunity to\r\neffect their ruin. Having resigned themselves to political degradation,\r\ngeneral cowardice and demoralization were the result.\r\n\r\n(M893) Masinissa, king of Numidia, made insolent claims on those Phœnician\r\nsettlements on the coast of Byzacene, which the Carthaginians possessed\r\nfrom the earliest times. Scipio was sent to Carthage, to arrange the\r\ndifficulty, as arbitrator, and the circumstances were so aggravated that\r\nhe could not, with any justice, decide in favor of the king, but declined\r\nto pronounce a verdict, so that Masinissa and Carthage should remain on\r\nterms of hostility. And as Masinissa reigned for fifty years after the\r\npeace, Carthage was subjected to continual vexations. At last a war broke\r\nout between them. Masinissa was stronger than Carthage, but the city\r\nraised a considerable army, and placed it under the conduct of Hasdrubal,\r\nwho marched against the perfidious enemy with fifty thousand mercenaries.\r\nThe battle was not decisive, but Hasdrubal retreated without securing his\r\ncommunication with Carthage. His army was cut off, and he sought terms of\r\npeace, which were haughtily rejected, and he then gave hostages for\r\nkeeping the peace, and agreed to pay five thousand talents within fifty\r\nyears, and acknowledge Masinissa’s usurpation. The Romans, instead of\r\nsettling the difficulties, instigated secretly Masinissa. And the Roman\r\ncommissioners sent to the Senate exaggerated accounts of the resources of\r\nCarthage. The Romans compelled the Carthaginians to destroy their timber\r\nand the materials they had in abundance for building a new fleet. Still\r\nthe Senate, having the control of the foreign relations, and having become\r\na mere assembly of kings, with the great power which the government of\r\nprovinces gave to it, was filled with renewed jealousy. Cato never made a\r\nspeech without closing with these words: “_Carthago est delenda._” A blind\r\nhatred animated that vindictive and narrow old patrician, who headed a\r\nparty with the avowed object of the destruction of Carthage. And it was\r\nfinally determined to destroy the city.\r\n\r\n(M894) The Romans took the Carthaginians to account for the war with\r\nMasinissa, and not contented with the humiliation of their old rival,\r\naimed at her absolute ruin, though she had broken no treaties. The\r\nCarthaginians, broken-hearted, sent embassy after embassy, imploring the\r\nSenate to preserve peace, to whom the senators gave equivocal answers. The\r\nsituation of Carthage was hopeless and miserable—stripped by Masinissa of\r\nthe rich towns of Emporia, and on the eve of another conflict with the\r\nmistress of the world.\r\n\r\n(M895) Had the city been animated by the spirit which Hannibal had sought\r\nto infuse, she was still capable of a noble defense. She ruled over three\r\nhundred Libyan cities, and had a population of seven hundred thousand. She\r\nhad accumulated two hundred thousand stand of arms, and two thousand\r\ncatapults. And she had the means to manufacture a still greater amount.\r\nBut she had, unfortunately, on the first demand of the Romans, surrendered\r\nthese means of defense.\r\n\r\n(M896) At last Rome declared war, B.C. 149—the wickedest war in which she\r\never engaged—and Cato had the satisfaction of seeing, at the age of\r\neighty-five, his policy indorsed against every principle of justice and\r\nhonor. A Roman army landed in Africa unopposed, and the Carthaginians were\r\nweak enough to surrender, not only three hundred hostages from the noblest\r\nfamilies, but the arms already enumerated. Nothing but infatuation can\r\naccount for this miserable concession of weakness to strength, all from a\r\nblind confidence in the tender mercies of an unpitying and unscrupulous\r\nfoe. Then, when the city was defenseless, the hostages in the hands of the\r\nRomans, and they almost at the gates, it was coolly announced that it was\r\nthe will of the Senate that the city should be destroyed.\r\n\r\n(M897) Too late, the doomed city prepared to make a last stand against an\r\ninexorable enemy. The most violent feelings of hatred and rage, added to\r\nthose of despair, at last animated the people of Carthage. It was the same\r\npassion which arrayed Tyre against Alexander, and Jerusalem against Titus.\r\nIt was a wild patriotic frenzy which knew no bounds, inspired by the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation, and aside from all calculation of success\r\nor failure. As the fall of the city was inevitable, wisdom might have\r\ncounseled an unreserved submission. Resistance should have been thought of\r\nbefore. In fact, Carthage should not have yielded to the first Africanus.\r\nAnd when she had again become rich and populous, she should have defied\r\nthe Romans when their spirit was perceived—should have made a more gallant\r\ndefense against Masinissa, and concentrated all her energies for a last\r\nstand upon her own territories. But why should we thus speculate? The doom\r\nof Carthage had been pronounced by the decrees of fate. The fall has all\r\nthe mystery and solemnity of a providential event, like the fall of all\r\nempires, like the defeat of Darius by Alexander, like the ruin of\r\nJerusalem, like the melting away of North American Indians, like the final\r\noverthrow of the “Eternal City” itself.\r\n\r\n(M898) The desperation of the city in her last conflict proves, however,\r\nthat, with proper foresight and patriotism, her fall might have been\r\ndelayed, for it took the Romans three years to subdue her. The disarmed\r\ncity withstood the attack of the Romans for a period five times as long as\r\nit required Vespasian and Titus to capture Jerusalem. The city resounded\r\nday and night with the labors of men and women on arms and catapults. One\r\nhundred and forty shields, three hundred swords, five hundred spears, and\r\none thousand missiles were manufactured daily, and even a fleet of one\r\nhundred and fifty ships was built during the siege. The land side of the\r\ncity was protected by a triple wall, and the rocks of Cape Camast and Cape\r\nCarthage sheltered it from all attacks by sea, except one side protected\r\nby fortified harbors and quays. Hasdrubal, with the remnant of his army,\r\nwas still in the field, and took up his station at Nephesis, on the\r\nopposite side of the lake of Tunis, to harass the besiegers. Masinissa\r\ndied at the age of ninety, soon after hostilities began.\r\n\r\n(M899) The first attack on Carthage was a failure, and the army of the\r\nConsuls Censorinus and Manius Manilius would have been cut to pieces, had\r\nit not been for the the reserve led by Scipio Æmilianus, a grandson of\r\nAfricanus, who was then serving as military tribune. He also performed\r\nmany gallant actions when Censorinus retired to Rome, leaving the army in\r\nthe hands of his incompetent colleague.\r\n\r\n(M900) The second campaign was equally unsuccessful, under L. Calpurnius\r\nFiso and L. Mancinus. The slow progress of the war excited astonishment\r\nthroughout the world. The suspense of the campaign was intolerable to the\r\nproud spirit of the Romans, who had never dreamed of such resistance. The\r\neyes of the Romans were then turned to the young hero who alone had thus\r\nfar distinguished himself. Although he had not reached the proper age, he\r\nwas chosen consul, and the province of Africa was assigned to him. He\r\nsailed with his friends Polybius and Lælius. He was by no means equal to\r\nthe elder Scipio, although he was an able general and an accomplished man.\r\nHe was ostentatious, envious, and proud, and had cultivation rather than\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\n(M901) When he arrived at Utica, he found the campaign of B.C. 147 opened\r\nin such a way that his arrival saved a great disaster. The admiral\r\nMancinus had attempted an attack on an undefended quarter, but a desperate\r\nsally of the besieged had exposed him to imminent danger, and he was only\r\nrelieved by the timely arrival of Scipio.\r\n\r\n(M902) The new general then continued the siege with new vigor. His\r\nheadquarters were fixed on an isthmus uniting the peninsula of Carthage\r\nwith the main-land, from which he attacked the suburb called Megara, and\r\ntook it, and shut up the Carthaginians in the old town and ports. The\r\ngarrison of the suburb and the army of Hasdrubal retreated within the\r\nfortifications of the city. The Carthaginian leader, to cut off all\r\nretreat, inflicted inhuman barbarities and tortures on all the Roman\r\nprisoners they took. Scipio, meanwhile, intrenched and fortified in the\r\nsuburb, cut off all communication between the city and main-land by\r\nparallel trenches, three miles in length, drawn across the whole isthmus.\r\nThe communication with the sea being still open, from which the besieged\r\nreceived supplies, the port was blocked up by a mole of stone ninety-six\r\nfeet wide. The besieged worked night and day, and cut a new channel to the\r\nsea, and, had they known how to improve their opportunity, might, with the\r\nnew fleet they had constructed, have destroyed that of their enemies,\r\nunprepared for action.\r\n\r\n(M903) Scipio now resolved to make himself master of the ports, which were\r\nseparated from the sea by quays and a weak wall. His battering-rams were\r\nat once destroyed by the Carthaginians. He then built a wall or rampart\r\nupon the quay, to the height of the city wall, and placed upon it four\r\nthousand men to harass the besieged. As the winter rains then set in,\r\nmaking his camp unhealthy, and the city was now closely invested by sea\r\nand land, he turned his attention to the fortified camp of the enemy at\r\nNephesis, which was taken by storm, and seventy thousand persons put to\r\nthe sword. The Carthaginian army was annihilated.\r\n\r\n(M904) Meanwhile famine pressed within the besieged city, and Hasdrubal\r\nwould not surrender. An attack, led by Lælius, on the market-place, gave\r\nthe Romans a foothold within the city, and a great quantity of spoil. One\r\nthousand talents were taken from the temple of Apollo. Preparations were\r\nthen made for the attack of the citadel, and for six days there was a\r\nhand-to-hand fight between the combatants amid the narrow streets which\r\nled to the Byrsa. The tall Oriental houses were only taken one by one and\r\nburned, and the streets were cumbered with the dead. The miserable people,\r\ncrowded within the citadel, certain now of destruction, then sent a\r\ndeputation to Scipio to beg the lives of those who had sought a retreat in\r\nthe Byrsa. The request was granted to all but Roman deserters. But out of\r\nthe great population of seven hundred thousand, only thirty thousand men\r\nand twenty-five thousand women marched from the burning ruins. Hasdrubal\r\nand the three hundred Roman deserters, certain of no mercy, retired to the\r\ntemple of Æsculapius, the heart of the citadel. But the Carthaginian,\r\nuniting pusillanimity with cruelty, no sooner found the temple on fire,\r\nthan he rushed out in Scipio’s presence, with an olive-branch in his\r\nhands, and abjectly begged for his life, which Scipio granted, after he\r\nhad prostrated himself at his feet in sight of his followers, who loaded\r\nhim with the bitterest execrations. The wife of Hasdrubal, deserted by the\r\nabject wretch, called down the curses of the gods on the man who had\r\nbetrayed his country and deserted at last his family. She then cut the\r\nthroats of her children and threw them into the flames, and then leaped\r\ninto them herself. The Roman deserters in the same manner perished. The\r\ncity was given up to plunder, the inhabitants whose lives were spared were\r\nsold as slaves, and the gold and works of art were carried to Rome and\r\ndeposited in the temples.\r\n\r\n(M905) Such was the fate of Carthage—a doom so awful, that we can not but\r\nfeel that it was sent as a chastisement for crimes which had long cried to\r\nHeaven for vengeance. Carthage always was supremely a wicked city. All the\r\nluxurious and wealthy capitals of ancient times were wicked, especially\r\nOriental cities, as Carthage properly, though not technically, was—founded\r\nby Phœnicians, and a worshiper of the gods of Tyre and Sidon. The Roman\r\nSenate decreed that not only the city, but even the villas of the nobles\r\nin the suburb of Megara, should be leveled with the ground, and the\r\nplowshare driven over the soil devoted to perpetual desolation, and a\r\ncurse to the man who should dare to cultivate it or build upon it. For\r\nfourteen days, the fires raged in this once populous and wealthy city, and\r\nthe destruction was complete, B.C. 146. So deep-seated was the Roman\r\nhatred of rivals, or States that had been rivals; so dreadful was the\r\npunishment of a wicked city, of which Scipio was made the instrument, not\r\nmerely of the Romans, but of Divine providence.\r\n\r\n(M906) All the great cities of antiquity, which had been seats of luxury\r\nand pride, had now been utterly destroyed—Nineveh, Babylon, Tyre, and\r\nCarthage. Corinth was already sacked by Mummius, and Jerusalem was to be\r\nby Titus, and Rome herself was finally to receive a still direr\r\nchastisement at the hands of Goths and Vandals. So Providence moves on in\r\nhis mysterious power to bring to naught the grandeur and power of\r\nrebellious nations—rebellious to those mighty moral laws which are as\r\ninexorable as the laws of nature.\r\n\r\nThe territory on the coast of Zeugitana and Byzantium, which formed the\r\nlast possession of Carthage, was erected into the province of Africa, and\r\nthe rich plain of that fertile province became more important to Rome for\r\nsupplies of corn than even Sicily, which had been the granary of Rome.\r\n\r\n(M907) Scipio returned to Rome, and enjoyed a triumph more gorgeous than\r\nthe great Africanus. He also lived to enjoy another triumph for brilliant\r\nsuccesses in Spain, yet to be enumerated, but was also doomed to lose his\r\npopularity, and to perish by the dagger of assassins.\r\n\r\n(M908) Rome had now acquired the undisputed dominion of the civilized\r\nworld, and with it, the vices of the nations she subdued. A great decline\r\nin Roman morals succeeded these brilliant conquests. Great internal\r\nchanges took place. The old distinction of patricians and plebeians had\r\nvanished, and a new nobility had arisen, composed of rich men and of those\r\nwhose ancestors had enjoyed curule magistracies. They possessed the\r\nSenate, and had control of the Comitia Centuriata, by the prerogative vote\r\nof the equestrian centuries. A base rabble had grown up, fed with corn and\r\noil, by the government, and amused by games and spectacles. The old\r\nrepublican aristocracy was supplanted by a family oligarchy. The vast\r\nwealth which poured into Rome from the conquered countries created\r\ndisproportionate fortunes. The votes of the people were bought by the rich\r\ncandidates for popular favor. The superstitions of the East were\r\ntransferred to the capitol of the world, and the decay in faith was as\r\nmarked as the decay in virtue. Chaldæan astrologers were scattered over\r\nItaly, and the gods of all the conquered peoples of the earth were\r\nworshiped at Rome. The bonds of society were loosed, and a state was\r\nprepared for the civil wars which proved even more destructive than the\r\nforeign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN CONQUESTS FROM THE FALL OF CARTHAGE TO THE TIMES OF THE GRACCHI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Roman domination now extended in some form or other over most\r\nof the countries around the Mediterranean, still several States remained\r\nto be subdued, in the East and in the West.\r\n\r\nThe subjugation of Spain first deserves attention, commenced before the\r\nclose of the third Punic war, and which I have omitted to notice for the\r\nsake of clearness of connection.\r\n\r\nAfter the Hannibalic war, we have seen how Rome planted her armies in\r\nSpain, and added two provinces to her empire. But the various tribes were\r\nfar from being subdued, and Spain was inhabited by different races.\r\n\r\n(M909) This great peninsula, bounded on the north by the ocean\r\nCantabricus, now called the Bay of Biscay, and the Pyrenees, on the east\r\nand south by the Mediterranean, and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, was\r\ncalled Iberia, by the Greeks, from the river Iberus, or Ebro. The term\r\nHispania was derived from the Phœnicians, who planted colonies on the\r\nsouthern shores. The Carthaginians invaded it next, and founded several\r\ncities, the chief of which was New Carthage. At the end of the second\r\nPunic war, it was wrested from them by the Romans, who divided it into two\r\nprovinces, Citerior and Ulterior. In the time of Augustus, Ulterior Spain\r\nwas divided into two provinces, called Lusitania and Bætica, while the\r\nCiterior province, by far the larger, occupying the whole northern country\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, was called Tanagona. It included\r\nthree-fifths of the peninsula, or about one hundred and seven thousand\r\nthree hundred square miles. It embraced the modern provinces of Catalonia,\r\nAragon, Navarre, Biscay, Asturias, Galicia, Northern Leon, old and new\r\nCastile, Murcia, and Valentia, and a part of Portugal. Bætica nearly\r\ncorresponded with Andalusia, and embraced Granada, Jaen, Cordova, Seville,\r\nand half of Spanish Estremadura. Lusitania corresponds nearly with\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\n(M910) The Tanaconneusis was inhabited by numerous tribes, and the chief\r\nancient cities were Barcelona, Tanagona the metropolis, Pampeluna, Oporto,\r\nNumantia, Saguntum, Saragossa, and Cartagena. In Bætica were Cordova,\r\nCastile, Gades, and Seville. In Lusitania were Olisipo (Lisbon), and\r\nSalamanca.\r\n\r\n(M911) Among the inhabitants of these various provinces were Iberians,\r\nCelts, Phœnicians, and Hellenes. In the year 154 B.C., the Lusitanians,\r\nunder a chieftain called Punicus, invaded the Roman territory which the\r\nelder Scipio had conquered, and defeated two Roman governors. The Romans\r\nthen sent a consular army, under Q. Fulvius Nobilior, which was ultimately\r\ndefeated by the Lusitanians under Cæsarus. This success kindled the flames\r\nof war far and near, and the Celtiberians joined in the warfare against\r\nthe Roman invaders. Again the Romans were defeated with heavy loss. The\r\nSenate then sent considerable re-enforcements, under Claudius Marcellus,\r\nwho soon changed the aspect of affairs. The nation of the Arevacæ\r\nsurrendered to the Romans—a people living on the branches of the Darius,\r\nnear Numantia—and their western neighbors, the Vaccæi, were also subdued,\r\nand barbarously dealt with. On the outbreak of the third Punic war the\r\naffairs of Spain were left to the ordinary governors, and a new\r\ninsurrection of the Lusitanians took place. Viriathus, a Spanish\r\nchieftain, signally defeated the Romans, and was recognized as king of all\r\nthe Lusitanians. He was distinguished, not only for bravery, but for\r\ntemperance and art, and was a sort of Homeric hero, whose name and\r\nexploits were sounded throughout the peninsula. He gained great victories\r\nover the Roman generals, and destroyed their armies. General after general\r\nwas successively defeated. For five years this gallant Spaniard kept the\r\nwhole Roman power at bay, and he was only destroyed by treachery.\r\n\r\n(M912) While the Lusitanians at the South were thus prevailing over the\r\nRoman armies on the bunks of the Tagus, another war broke out in the North\r\namong the Celtiberian natives. Against these people Quintus Cæcilius\r\nMetellus, the consul, was sent. He showed great ability, and in two years\r\nreduced the whole northern province, except the two cities of Termantia\r\nand Numantia. These cities, wearied at last with war, agreed to submit to\r\nthe Romans, and delivered up hostages and deserters, with a sum of money.\r\nBut the Senate, with its usual policy, refused to confirm the treaty of\r\nits general, which perfectly aroused the Numantines to resentment and\r\ndespair. These brave people obtained successes against the Roman general\r\nLænas and his successors, Mancinus and M. Æmilius Lepides, as well as\r\nPhilus and Piso.\r\n\r\n(M913) The Romans, aroused at last to this inglorious war, which had\r\nlasted nearly ten years, resolved to take the city of the Numantines at\r\nany cost, and intrusted the work to Scipio Æmilianus, their best general.\r\nHe spent the summer (B.C. 134) in extensive preparations, and it was not\r\ntill winter that he drew his army round the walls of Numantia, defended by\r\nonly eight thousand citizens. Scipio even declined a battle, and fought\r\nwith mattock and spade. A double wall of circumvallation, surmounted with\r\ntowers, was built around the city, and closed the access to it by the\r\nDouro, by which the besieged relied upon for provisions. The city\r\nsustained a memorable siege of nearly a year, and was only reduced by\r\nfamine. The inhabitants were sold as slaves, and the city was leveled with\r\nthe ground. The fall of this fortress struck at the root of opposition to\r\nRome, and a senatorial commission was sent to Spain, in order to organize\r\nwith Scipio the newly-won territories, and became henceforth the\r\nbest-regulated country of all the provinces of Rome.\r\n\r\n(M914) But a graver difficulty existed with the African, Greek, and\r\nAsiatic States that had been brought under the influence of the Roman\r\nhegemony, which was neither formal sovereignty nor actual subjection. The\r\nclient States had neither independence nor peace. The Senate,\r\nnevertheless, perpetually interfered with the course of African, Hellenic,\r\nAsiatic, and Egyptian affairs. Commissioners were constantly going to\r\nAlexandria, to the Achæan diet, and to the courts of the Asiatic princes,\r\nand the government of Rome deprived the nations of the blessings of\r\nfreedom and the blessings of order.\r\n\r\n(M915) It was time to put a stop to this state of things, and the only way\r\nto do so was to convert the client States into Roman provinces. After the\r\ndestruction of Carthage, the children of Masinissa retained in substance\r\ntheir former territories, but were not allowed to make Carthage their\r\ncapital. Her territories became a Roman province, whose capital was Utica.\r\n\r\n(M916) Macedonia also disappeared, like Carthage, from the ranks of\r\nnations. But the four small States into which the kingdom was parceled\r\ncould not live in peace. Neither Roman commissioners nor foreign arbiters\r\ncould restore order. At this crisis a young man appeared in Thrace, who\r\ncalled himself the son of Perseus. This pseudo-Philip, for such was his\r\nname, strikingly resembled the son of Perseus. Unable to obtain\r\nrecognition in his native country, he went to Demetrius Sotor, king of\r\nSyria. By him he was sent to Rome. The Senate attached so little\r\nimportance to the man, that he was left, imperfectly guarded, in an\r\nItalian town, and fled to Miletus. Again arrested, and again contriving to\r\nescape, he went to Thrace, and obtained a recognition from Teres, the\r\nchief of the Thracian barbarians. With his support he invaded Macedonia,\r\nand obtained several successes over the Macedonian militia. The Roman\r\ncommissioner Nasica, without troops, was obliged to call to his aid the\r\nAchæan and Pergamene soldiers, until defended by a Roman legion under the\r\nprætor Juventius. Juventius was slain by the pretender, and his army cut\r\nto pieces. And it was not until a stronger Roman array, under Quintus\r\nCæcilius Metellus, appeared, that he was subdued. The four States into\r\nwhich Macedonia had been divided were now converted into a Roman province,\r\nB.C. 148, and Macedonia became, not a united kingdom, but a united\r\nprovince, with nearly the former limits.\r\n\r\nThe defense of the Hellenic civilization now devolved on the Romans, but\r\nwas not conducted with adequate forces or befitting energy, and the petty\r\nStates were therefore exposed to social disorganization, and the Greeks\r\nevidently sought to pick a quarrel with Rome.\r\n\r\n(M917) Hence the Achæan war, B.C. 149. It is not of much historical\r\nimportance. It was commenced under Metellus, and continued under Mummius,\r\nwho reduced the noisy belligerents to terms, and entered Corinth, the seat\r\nof rebellion, and the first commercial city of Greece. By order of the\r\nSenate, the Corinthian citizens were sold into slavery, the fortifications\r\nof the city leveled with the ground, and the city itself was sacked. The\r\nmock sovereignty of leagues was abolished, and all remains of Grecian\r\nliberty fled.\r\n\r\n(M918) In Asia Minor, after the Seleucidæ were driven away, Pergamus\r\nbecame the first power. But even this State did not escape the jealousy of\r\nthe Romans, and with Attalus III. the house of Attalids became extinct.\r\n\r\n(M919) He, however, had bequeathed his kingdom to the Romans, and his\r\ntestament kindled a civil war. Aristonicus, a natural son of Eumenes II.,\r\nmade his appearance at Lecuæ, a small sea-port near Smyrna, as a pretender\r\nto the crown. He was defeated by the Ephesians, who saw the necessity of\r\nthe protection and friendship of the Roman government. But he again\r\nappeared with new troops, and the struggle was serious, since there were\r\nno Roman troops in Asia. But, B.C. 131, a Roman army was sent under the\r\nconsul Publius Licinius Crassus Mucianus, one of the wealthiest men of\r\nRome, distinguished as an orator and jurist. This distinguished general\r\nwas about to lay siege to Leucæ, when he was surprised and taken captive,\r\nand put to death. His successor, Marcus Perpenua, was fortunate in his\r\nwarfare, and the pretender was taken prisoner, and executed at Rome. The\r\nremaining cities yielded to the conqueror, and Asia Minor became a Roman\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n(M920) In other States the Romans set up kings as they chose. In Syria,\r\nAntiochus Eupater was recognized over the claims of Demetrius Sotor, then\r\na hostage in Rome. But he contrived to escape, and seized the government\r\nof his ancestral kingdom. But it would seem that the Romans, at this\r\nperiod, did not take a very lively interest in the affairs of remote\r\nAsiatic States, and the decrees of the Senate were often disregarded with\r\nimpunity. A great reaction of the East took place against the West, and,\r\nunder Mithridates, a renewed struggle again gave dignity to the Eastern\r\nkingdoms, which had not raised their heads since the conquests of\r\nAlexander. That memorable struggle will be alluded to in the proper place.\r\nIt was a difficult problem which Rome undertook when she undertook to\r\ngovern the Asiatic world. It was easy to conquer; it was difficult to\r\nrule, when degeneracy and luxury became the vices of the Romans\r\nthemselves. We are now to trace those domestic dissensions and civil wars\r\nwhich indicate the decline of the Roman republic. But before we describe\r\nthose wars, we will take a brief survey of the social and political\r\nchanges in Rome at this period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN CIVILIZATION AT THE CLOSE OF THE THIRD PUNIC WAR, AND THE FALL OF\r\nGREECE.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M921) Rome was now the unrivaled mistress of the world. She had conquered\r\nall the civilized States around the Mediterranean, or had established a\r\nprotectorate over them. She had no fears of foreign enemies. Her empire\r\nwas established.\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed to present subsequent conquests or domestic revolutions,\r\nit would be well to glance at the political and social structure of the\r\nState, as it was two hundred years before the Christian era, and also at\r\nthe progress which had been made in literature and art.\r\n\r\n(M922) One of the most noticeable features of the Roman State at this\r\nperiod was the rise of a new nobility. The patricians, when they lost the\r\nexclusive control of the government, did not cease to be a powerful\r\naristocracy. But another class of nobles arose in the fifth century of the\r\ncity, and shared their power—those who had held curule offices and were\r\nmembers of the Senate. Their descendants, plebeian as well as patrician,\r\nhad the privilege of placing the wax images of their ancestors in the\r\nfamily hall, and to have them carried in funeral processions. They also\r\nwore a stripe of purple on the tunic, and a gold ring on the finger. These\r\nwere trifling insignia of rank, still they were emblems and signs by which\r\nthe nobility were distinguished. The plebeian families, ennobled by their\r\ncurule ancestors, were united into one body with the patrician families,\r\nand became a sort of hereditary nobility. This body of exclusive families\r\nreally possessed the political power of the State. The Senate was made up\r\nfrom their members, and was the mainstay of Roman nobility. The equites,\r\nor equestrian order, was also composed of the patricians and wealthy\r\nplebeians. Noble youths gradually withdrew from serving in the infantry,\r\nand the legionary cavalry became a closed aristocratic corps. Not only\r\nwere the nobles the possessors of senatorial privileges, and enrolled\r\namong the equites, but they had separate seats from the people at the\r\ngames and at the theatres. The censorship also became a prop to the\r\nstability of the aristocratic class.\r\n\r\n(M923) We have some idea of the influence of the aristocracy from the\r\nfamilies which furnished the higher offices of the State. For three\r\ncenturies the consuls were chiefly chosen from powerful families. The\r\nCornelii gentes furnished fifteen consuls in one hundred and twelve years,\r\nand the Valerii, ten. And, what is more remarkable, for the following one\r\nhundred and fifty years these two families furnished nearly the same\r\nnumber. In one hundred and twelve years fifteen families gave seventy\r\nconsuls to the State: the Cornelii, fifteen; the Valerii, ten; the\r\nClaudii, four; the Æmilii, nine; the Fabii, six; the Manilii, four; the\r\nPostumii, two; the Servilii, three; the Sulpicii, six; and also about the\r\nsame number the following one hundred and fifty years, thereby showing\r\nthat old families, whether patrician or plebeian, were long kept in sight,\r\nand monopolized political power. This was also seen in the elevation of\r\nyoung men of these ranks to high office before they had reached the lawful\r\nage. M. Valerius Corvus was consul at twenty-three, Scipio at thirty, and\r\nFlaminius at twenty-nine.\r\n\r\n(M924) The control of Rome over conquered provinces introduced a new class\r\nof magistrates, selected by the Senate, and chosen from the aristocratic\r\ncircles. These were the provincial governors or prætors, who had great\r\npower, and who sometimes appeared in all the pomp of kings. They resided\r\nin the ancient palaces of the kings, and had great opportunities for\r\naccumulating fortunes. Nor could the governors be called to account, until\r\nafter their term of office expired, which rarely happened. The governors\r\nwere, virtually, sovereigns while they continued in office—were satraps,\r\nwho conducted a legalized tyranny abroad, and returned home arrogant and\r\naccustomed to adulation—a class of men who proved dangerous to the old\r\ninstitutions, those which recognized equality within the aristocracy and\r\nthe subordination of power to the senatorial college.\r\n\r\n(M925) The burgesses, or citizens, before this period, were a very\r\nrespectable body, patriotic and sagacious. They occupied chiefly Latium, a\r\npart of Campania, and the maritime colonies. But gradually, a rabble of\r\nclients grew up on footing equality with these independent burgesses.\r\nThese clients, as the aristocracy increased in wealth and power, became\r\nparasites and beggars, and undermined the burgess class, and controlled\r\nthe Comitia. This class rapidly increased, and were clamorous for games,\r\nfestivals, and cheap bread, for corn was distributed to them by those who\r\nwished to gain their favor at elections, at less than cost. Hence,\r\nfestivals and popular amusements became rapidly a great feature of the\r\ntimes. For five hundred years the people had been contented with one\r\nfestival in a year, and one circus. Flaminius added another festival, and\r\nanother circus. In the year 550 of the city, there were five festivals.\r\nThe candidates for the consulship spent large sums on these games, the\r\nsplendor of which became the standard by which the electoral body measured\r\nthe fitness of candidates. A gladiatorial show cost seven hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand sesterces, or thirty-six thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n(M926) And corruption extended to the army. The old burgess militia were\r\ncontented to return home with some trifling gift as a memorial of victory,\r\nbut the troops of Scipio, and the veterans of the Macedonian and Asiatic\r\nwars, came back enriched with spoils. A decay of a warlike spirit was\r\nobservable from the time the burgesses converted war into a traffic in\r\nplunder. A great passion also arose for titles and insignia, which\r\nappeared under different forms, especially for the honors of a triumph,\r\noriginally granted only to the supreme magistrate who had signally\r\naugmented the power of the State. Statues and monuments were often erected\r\nat the expense of the person whom they purported to honor. And finally,\r\nthe ring, the robe, and the amulet case distinguished not only the\r\nburgesses from the foreigners and slaves, but also the person who was born\r\nfree from one who had been a slave, the son of the free-born from the son\r\nof the manumitted, the son of a knight from a common burgess, the\r\ndescendant of a curule house from the common senators. These distinctions\r\nin rank kept pace with the extension of conquests, until, at last, there\r\nwas as complete a net work of aristocratic distinctions as in England at\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\n(M927) All these distinctions and changes were bitterly deplored by Marcus\r\nPortius Cato—the last great statesman of the older school—a genuine Roman\r\nof the antique stamp. He was also averse to schemes of universal empire.\r\nHe was a patrician, brought up at the plow, and in love with his Sabine\r\nfarm. Yet he rose to the consulship, and even the censorship. He served in\r\nwar under Marcellus, Fabius, and Scipio, and showed great ability as a\r\nsoldier. He was as distinguished in the forum as in the camp and\r\nbattle-field, having a bold address, pungent wit, and great knowledge of\r\nthe Roman laws. He was the most influential political orator of his day.\r\nHe was narrow in his political ideas, conservative, austere, and upright;\r\nan enemy to all corruption and villainy, also to genius, and culture, and\r\ninnovation. He was the protector of the Roman farmer, plain, homely in\r\nperson, disdained by the ruling nobles, but fearless in exposing\r\ncorruption from any quarter, and irreconcilably at war with aristocratic\r\ncoteries, like the Scipios and Flaminii. He was publicly accused\r\ntwenty-four times, but he was always backed by the farmers,\r\nnotwithstanding the opposition of the nobles. He erased, while censor, the\r\nname of the brother of Flaminius from the roll of senators, and the\r\nbrother of Scipio from that of the equites. He attempted a vigorous\r\nreform, but the current of corruption could only be stemmed for awhile.\r\nThe effect of the sumptuary laws, which were passed through his influence,\r\nwas temporary and unsatisfactory. No legislation has proved of avail\r\nagainst a deep-seated corruption of morals, for the laws will be avoided,\r\neven if they are not defied. In vain was the eloquence of the hard,\r\narbitrary, narrow, worldly wise, but patriotic and stern old censor. The\r\nage of Grecian culture, of wealth, of banquets, of palaces, of games, of\r\neffeminate manners, had set in with the conquest of Greece and Asia. The\r\ndivisions of society widened, and the seeds of luxury and pride were to\r\nproduce violence and decay.\r\n\r\n(M928) Still some political changes were effected at this time. The\r\nComitia Centuriata was remodeled. The equites no longer voted first. The\r\nfive classes obtained an equal number of votes, and the freedmen were\r\nplaced on an equal footing with free-born. Thus terminated the long\r\nconflict between patricians and plebeians. But although the right of\r\nprecedence in voting was withdrawn from the equites, still the patrician\r\norder was powerful enough to fill, frequently, the second consulship and\r\nthe second censorship, which were open to patricians and plebeians alike,\r\nwith men of their own order. At this time the office of dictator went into\r\nabeyance, and was practically abolished; the priests were elected by the\r\nwhole community; the public assemblies interfered with the administration\r\nof the public property—the exclusive prerogative of the Senate in former\r\ntimes—and thus transferred the public domains to their own pockets. These\r\nwere changes which showed the disorganization of the government rather\r\nthan healthy reform. To this period we date the rise of demagogues, for a\r\nminority in the Senate had the right to appeal to the Comitia, which\r\nopened the way for wealthy or popular men to thwart the wisest actions and\r\nselect incompetent magistrates and generals. Even Publius Scipio was not\r\nmore distinguished for his arrogance and title-hunting than for the army\r\nof clients he supported, and for the favor which he courted, of both\r\nlegions and people, by his largesses of grain.\r\n\r\n(M929) At this period, agriculture had reached considerable perfection,\r\nbut Cato declared that his fancy farm was not profitable. Figs, apples,\r\npears were cultivated, as well as olives and grapes—also shade-trees. The\r\nrearing of cattle was not of much account, as the people lived chiefly on\r\nvegetables, and fruits and corn. Large cattle were kept only for tillage.\r\nConsiderable use was made of poultry and pigeons—kept in the farm-yard.\r\nFish-ponds and hare-preserves were also common. The labor of the fields\r\nwas performed by oxen, and asses for carriage and the turning of mills.\r\nThe human labor on farms was done by slaves. Vineyards required more\r\nexpenditure of labor than ordinary tillage. An estate of one hundred\r\njugera, with vine plantations, required one plowman, eleven slaves, and\r\ntwo herdsmen. The slaves were not bred on the estate, but were purchased.\r\nThey lived in the farm-buildings, among cattle and produce. A separate\r\nhouse was erected for the master. A steward had the care of the slaves.\r\nThe stewardess attended to the baking and cooking, and all had the same\r\nfare, delivered from the produce of the farm on which they lived. Great\r\nunscrupulousness pervaded the management of these estates. Slaves and\r\ncattle were placed on the same level, and both were fed as long as they\r\ncould work, and sold when they were incapacitated by age or sickness. A\r\nslave had no recreations or holidays. His time was spent between working\r\nand sleeping. And when we remember that these slaves were white as well as\r\nblack, and had once been free, their condition was hard and inhuman. No\r\nnegro slavery ever was so cruel as slavery among the Romans. Great labors\r\nand responsibilities were imposed upon the steward. He was the first to\r\nrise in the morning, and the last to go to bed at night; but he was not\r\ndoomed to constant labor, like the slaves whom he superintended. He also\r\nhad few pleasures, and was obsequious to the landlord, who performed no\r\nwork, except in the earlier ages. The small farmer worked himself with the\r\nslaves and his children. He more frequently cultivated flowers and\r\nvegetables for the market of Rome. Pastoral husbandry was practiced on a\r\ngreat scale, and at least eight hundred jugera were required. On such\r\nestates, horses, oxen, mules, and asses were raised, also herds of swine\r\nand goats. The breeding of sheep was an object of great attention and\r\ninterest, since all clothing was made of wool. The shepherd-slaves lived\r\nin the open air, remote from human habitations, under sheds and\r\nsheep-folds.\r\n\r\n(M930) The prices of all produce were very small in comparison with\r\npresent rates, and this was owing, in part, to the immense quantities of\r\ncorn and other produce delivered by provincials to the Roman government,\r\nsometimes gratuitously. The armies were supported by transmarine corn. The\r\ngovernment regulated prices. In the time of Scipio, African wheat was sold\r\nas low as twelve ases for six _modii_—(one and a half bushel)—about\r\nsixpence. At one time two hundred and forty thousand bushels of Sicilian\r\ngrain were distributed at this price. The rise of demagogism promoted\r\nthese distributions, which kept prices down, so that the farmers received\r\nbut a small reward for labors, which made, of course, the condition of\r\nlaborers but little above that of brutes: when the people of the capital\r\npaid but sixpence sterling for a bushel and a half of wheat, or one\r\nhundred and eighty pounds of dried figs, or sixty pounds of oil, or\r\nseventy-two pounds of meat, or four and a half gallons of wine sold only\r\nfor fivepence, or three-fifths of a denarius. In the time of Polybius, the\r\ntraveler was charged for victuals and lodgings at an inn only about two\r\nfarthings a day, and a bushel of wheat sold for fourpence. At such prices\r\nthere was very little market for the farmer. Sicily and Sardinia were the\r\nreal granaries of Rome. Thus were all the best interests of the country\r\nsacrificed to the unproductive population of the city. Such was the golden\r\nage of the republic—a state of utter misery and hardship among the\r\nproductive classes, and idleness among the Roman people—a state of society\r\nwhich could but lead to ruin. The farmers, without substantial returns,\r\nlost energy and spirit, and dwindled away. Their estates fell into the\r\nhands of great proprietors, who owned great numbers of slaves. They\r\nthemselves were ruined, and sunk into an ignoble class. The cultivation of\r\ngrain in Italy was gradually neglected, and attention was given chiefly to\r\nvines, and olives, and wool. The rearing of cattle became more profitable\r\nthan tillage, and small farms were absorbed in great estates.\r\n\r\n(M931) The monetary transactions of the Romans were preeminently\r\nconspicuous. No branch of commercial industry was prosecuted with more\r\nzeal than money-lending. The bankers of Rome were a great class, and were\r\ngenerally rich. They speculated in corn and all articles of produce. Usury\r\nwas not disdained even by the nobles. Money-lending became a great system,\r\nand all the laws operated in favor of capitalists.\r\n\r\nIndustrial art did not keep pace with usurious calculations, and trades\r\nwere concentrated in the capital. Mechanical skill was neglected in all\r\nthe rural districts.\r\n\r\n(M932) Business operations were usually conducted by slaves. Even\r\nmoney-lenders and bankers made use of them. Every one who took contracts\r\nfor building, bought architect slaves. Every one who provided spectacles\r\npurchased a band of serfs expert in the art of fighting. The merchants\r\nimported wares in vessels managed by slaves. Mines were worked by slaves.\r\nManufactories were conducted by slaves. Everywhere were slaves.\r\n\r\n(M933) While the farmer obtained only fourpence a bushel for his wheat, a\r\npenny a gallon for his wine, and fivepence for sixty pounds of oil, the\r\ncapitalists, centered in Rome, possessed fortunes which were vastly\r\ndisproportionate to those which are seen in modern capitals. Paulus was\r\nnot reckoned wealthy for a senator, but his estate was valued at sixty\r\ntalents, nearly £15,000, or $75,000. In other words, the daily interest of\r\nhis capital was fifteen dollars, enough to purchase one hundred and eighty\r\nbushels of wheat—as much as a farmer could raise in a year on eight\r\njugera—a farm as large as that of Cincinnatus. Each of the daughters of\r\nScipio received as a dowry fifty talents, or $60,000. The value of this\r\nsum, in our money, when measured by the scale of wheat, or oil, or\r\nwine—allowing wheat now to be worth five shillings sterling a\r\nbushel—against fivepence in those times, would make gold twelve times more\r\nvaluable then than now. And hence, Scipio left each of his daughters a sum\r\nequal to $720,000 of our money. In estimating the fortune of a Roman, by\r\nthe prices charged at an inn per day, a penny would go further then than a\r\ndollar would now. But I think that gold and silver, in the time of Scipio,\r\nwere about the same value as in England at the time of Henry VII., about\r\ntwenty times our present standard.\r\n\r\n(M934) Every law at Rome tended in its operation to the benefit of the\r\ncreditor, and to vast accumulations of property; for the government being\r\nin the hands of the rich, as in England a century since, and in France\r\nbefore the Revolution, favored the rich at the expense of the poor. It\r\nbecame disgraceful at Rome to perform manual labor, and a wall separated\r\nthe laboring classes from the capitalists, which could not be passed.\r\nIndustrial art took the lowest place in the scale of labor, and was in the\r\nhands of slaves. The traffic in money, and the farming of the revenue\r\nformed the mainstay and stronghold of the Roman economy. The free\r\npopulation of Italy declined, while the city of Rome increased. The loss\r\nwas supplied by slaves. In the year 502 of the city, the Roman burgesses\r\nin Italy numbered two hundred and ninety-eight thousand men capable of\r\nbearing arms. Fifty years later, the number was only two hundred and\r\nfourteen thousand. The nation visibly diminished, and the community was\r\nresolved into masters and slaves. And this decline of citizens and\r\nincrease of slaves were beheld with indifference, for pride, and cruelty,\r\nand heartlessness were the characteristics of the higher classes.\r\n\r\n(M935) With the progress of luxury, and the decline of the rural\r\npopulation, and the growth of disproportionate fortunes, residence in the\r\ncapital became more and more coveted, and more and more costly. Rents rose\r\nto an unexampled height. Extravagant prices were paid for luxuries. When a\r\nbushel of corn sold for fivepence, a barrel of anchovies from the Black\r\nSea cost £14, and a beautiful boy twenty-four thousand sesterces (£246),\r\nmore than a farmer’s homestead. Money came to be prized as the end of\r\nlife, and all kinds of shifts and devices were made to secure it.\r\nMarriage, on both sides, became an object of mercantile speculation.\r\n\r\n(M936) In regard to education, there was a higher development than is\r\nusually supposed, and literature and art were cultivated, even while the\r\nnation declined in real virtue and strength. By means of the Greek slaves,\r\nthe Greek language and literature reached even the lower ranks, to a\r\ncertain extent. “The comedies indicate that the humblest classes were\r\nfamiliar with a sort of Latin, which could no more be understood without a\r\nknowledge of Greek, than Wieland’s German without a knowledge of French.”\r\nGreek was undoubtedly spoken by the higher classes, as French is spoken in\r\nall the courts of Europe. In the rudiments of education, the lowest people\r\nwere instructed, and even slaves were schoolmasters. At the close of the\r\nPunic wars, both comedy and tragedy were among the great amusements of the\r\nRomans, and great writers arose, who wrote, however, from the Greek\r\nmodels. Livius translated Homer, and Nævius popularized the Greek drama.\r\nPlautus, it is said, wrote one hundred and thirty plays. The tragedies of\r\nEnnius were recited to the latter days of the empire. The Romans did not,\r\nindeed, make such advance in literature as the Greeks, at a comparatively\r\nearly period of their history, but their attainments were respectable when\r\nCarthage was destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REFORM MOVEMENT OF THE GRACCHI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA new era in the history of Rome now commences, a period of glory and\r\nshame, when a great change took place in the internal structure of the\r\nState, now corrupted by the introduction of Greek and Asiatic refinements,\r\nand the vast wealth which rolled into the capital of the world.\r\n\r\n(M937) “For a whole generation after the battle of Pydna, the Roman State\r\nenjoyed a profound calm, scarcely varied by a ripple here and there upon\r\nthe surface. Its dominion extended over three continents; all eyes rested\r\non Italy; all talents and all riches flowed thither; it seemed as if a\r\ngolden age of peaceful prosperity and intellectual enjoyment of life had\r\nbegun. The Orientals of this period told each other with astonishment of\r\nthe mighty republic of the West. And such was the glory of the Romans,\r\nthat no one usurped the crown, and no one glittered in purple dress; but\r\nthey obeyed whomsoever from year to year they made their master, and there\r\nwas among them neither envy nor discord.”\r\n\r\n(M938) So things seemed at a distance. But this splendid external was\r\ndeceptive. The government of the aristocracy was hastening to its ruin.\r\nThere was a profound meaning, says Mommsen, in the question of Cato: “What\r\nwas to become of Rome when she should no longer have any State to fear?”\r\nAll her neighbors were now politically annihilated, and the single thought\r\nof the aristocracy was how they should perpetuate their privileges. A\r\ngovernment of aristocratic nobodies was now inaugurated, which kept new\r\nmen of merit from doing any thing, for fear they should belong to their\r\nexclusive ranks. Even an aristocratic conqueror was inconvenient.\r\n\r\n(M939) Still opposition existed to this aristocratic régime, and some\r\nreforms had been carried out. The administration of justice was improved.\r\nThe senatorial commissions to the provinces were found inadequate. An\r\neffort was made to emancipate the Comitia from the prepondering influence\r\nof the aristocracy. The senators were compelled to renounce their public\r\nhorse on admission to the Senate, and also the privilege of voting in the\r\neighteen equestrian centimes. But there was the semblance of increased\r\ndemocratic power rather than the reality. All the great questions of the\r\nday turned upon the election of the curule magistracies, and there was\r\nsufficient influence among the nobles to secure these offices. Young men\r\nfrom noble families crowded into the political arena, and claimed what\r\nonce was the reward of distinguished merit. Powerful connections were\r\nindispensable for the enjoyment of political power, as in England at the\r\ntime of Burke. A large body of clients waited on their patron early every\r\nmorning, and the candidates for office used all those arts which are\r\ncustomary when votes were to be bought. The government no longer disposed\r\nof the property of burgesses for the public good, nor favored the idea\r\namong them that they were exempted from taxes. Political corruption\r\nreached through all grades and classes. Capitalists absorbed the small\r\nfarms, and great fortunes were the scandal of the times. Capital was more\r\nvalued than labor. Italian farms depreciated from the conversion of\r\ntillage into pasture lands and parks, as in England in the present day.\r\nSlavery inordinately increased from the captives taken in war. Western\r\nAsia furnished the greatest number of this miserable population, and\r\nCretan and Cilician slave-hunters were found on all the coasts of Syria\r\nand Greece. Delos was the great slave-market of the world, where the\r\nslave-dealers of Asia Minor disposed of their wares to Italian\r\nspeculators. In one day as many as ten thousand slaves were disembarked\r\nand sold. Farms, and trades, and mines were alike carried on by these\r\nslaves from Asia, and their sufferings and hardships were vastly greater\r\nthan ever endured by negroes on the South Carolinian and Cuban\r\nplantations. But they were of a different race—men who had seen better\r\ndays, and accustomed to civilization—and hence they often rose upon their\r\nmasters. Servile wars were of common occurrence, Sicily at one time had\r\nseventy thousand slaves in arms, and when consular armies were sent to\r\nsuppress the revolt, the most outrageous cruelties were inflicted. Twenty\r\nthousand men, at one time, were crucified in Sicily by Publius Rupilius.\r\n\r\n(M940) At this crisis, when disproportionate wealth and slavery were the\r\ngreat social evils, Tiberius Gracchus arose—a young man of high rank,\r\nchivalrous, noble, and eloquent. His mother, Cornelia, was the daughter of\r\nScipio Africanus, and therefore belonged to the most exclusive of the\r\naristocratic circles. Tiberius Gracchus was therefore the cousin of Scipio\r\nÆmilianus, under whom he served with distinction in Africa. He was\r\nseconded in his views of reform by some stern old patriots and\r\naristocrats, who had not utterly forgotten the interests of the State, now\r\nbeing undermined. Appius Claudius, his father-in-law, who had been both\r\nconsul and censor; Publius Mucius Scævola, the great lawyer and founder of\r\nscientific jurisprudence; his brother, Publius Crassus Mucianus; the\r\nPontifex Maximus; Quintus Metellus, the conqueror of Macedonia—all men of\r\nthe highest rank and universally respected, entered into his schemes of\r\nreform.\r\n\r\n(M941) This patriotic patrician was elected tribune B.C. 134, at a time\r\nwhen political mismanagement, moral decay, the decline of burgesses, and\r\nthe increase of slaves, were most apparent. So Gracchus, after entering\r\nupon his office, proposed the enaction of an agrarian law, by which all\r\nState lands, occupied by the possessors, without remuneration, should\r\nrevert to the State, except five hundred jugera for himself, and two\r\nhundred and fifty for each son. The domain land thus resumed was to be\r\ndivided into lots of thirty jugera, and these distributed to burgesses and\r\nItalian allies, not as free property, but inalienable leaseholds, for\r\nwhich they paid rent to the State. This was a declaration of war upon the\r\ngreat landholders. The proposal of Gracchus was paralyzed by the vote of\r\nhis colleague, Marcus Octavius. Gracchus then, in his turn, suspended the\r\nbusiness of the State and the administration of justice, and placed his\r\nseal on the public chest. The government was obliged to acquiesce.\r\nGracchus, also, as the year was drawing to a close, brought his law to the\r\nvote a second time. Again it was vetoed by Octavius. Gracchus then, at the\r\ninvitation of the consuls, discussed the matter in the Senate; but the\r\nSenate, composed of great proprietors, would not yield. All constitutional\r\nmeans were now exhausted, and Gracchus must renounce his reform or begin a\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n(M942) He chose the latter. Before the assembled people he demanded that\r\nhis colleague should be deposed, which was against all the customs, and\r\nlaws, and precedents of the past. The assembly, composed chiefly of the\r\nproletarians who had come from the country—the Comitia Tributa—voted\r\naccording to his proposal, and Octavius was removed by the lictors from\r\nthe tribune bench, and then the agrarian law was passed by acclamation.\r\nThe Commissioners chosen to confiscate and redistribute the lands were\r\nTiberius Gracchus, his brother Gaius, and his father-in-law Appius\r\nClaudius, which family selection vastly increased the indignation of the\r\nSenate, who threw every obstacle in the way.\r\n\r\n(M943) The author of the law, fearing for his personal safety, no longer\r\nappeared in the forum without a retinue of three or four thousand men,\r\nanother cause of bitter hatred on the part of the aristocracy. He also\r\nsought to be re-elected tribune, but the Assembly broke up without a\r\nchoice. The next day the election terminated in the same manner, and it\r\nwas rumored in the city that Tiberius had deposed all the tribunes, and\r\nwas resolved to continue in office without re-election. A tumult,\r\noriginating with the Senate, was the result. A mob of senators rushed\r\nthrough the streets, with fury in their eyes and clubs in their hands. The\r\npeople gave way, and Gracchus was slain on the slope of the capitol. The\r\nSenate officially sanctioned the outrage, on the ground that Tiberius\r\nmeditated the usurpation of supreme power.\r\n\r\n(M944) In regard to the author of this agrarian law, there is no doubt he\r\nwas patriotic in his intentions, was public-spirited, and wished to revive\r\nthe older and better days of the republic. I do not believe he\r\ncontemplated the usurpation of supreme power. I doubt if he was ambitious,\r\nas Cæsar was. But he did not comprehend the issues at stake, and the shock\r\nhe was giving to the constitution of his country. He was like Mirabeau,\r\nthat other aristocratic reformer, who voted for the spoliation of the\r\nchurch property of France, on the ground, which that leveling\r\nsentimentalist Rousseau had advanced, that the church property belonged to\r\nthe nation. But this plea, in both cases, was sophistical. It was,\r\ndoubtless, a great evil that the property of the State had fallen into the\r\nhands of wealthy proprietors, as it was an evil that half the landed\r\nproperty of France was in possession of the clergy. But, in both cases,\r\nthis property had been enjoyed uninterruptedly for centuries by the\r\npossessors, and, to all intents and purposes, was _private_ property. And\r\nthis law of confiscation was therefore an encroachment on the rights of\r\nproperty, in all its practical bearings. It appeared to the jurists of\r\nthat age to be an ejection of the great landholders for the benefit of the\r\nproletarians. The measure itself was therefore not without injustice,\r\ndesirable as a division of property might be. But the mode to effect this\r\ndivision was incompatible with civilization itself. It was an appeal to\r\nrevolutionary forces. It was setting aside all constitutional checks and\r\nusages. It was a defiance of the Senate, the great ruling body of the\r\nState. It was an appeal to the people to overturn the laws. It was like\r\nassembling the citizens of London to override the Parliament. It was like\r\nthe French revolution, when the Assembly was dictated to by the clubs.\r\nRobespierre may have been sincere and patriotic, but he was a fanatic,\r\nfierce and uncompromising. So was Gracchus. In setting aside his\r\ncolleagues, to accomplish what he deemed a good end, he did evil. When\r\nthis rich patrician collected the proletarian burgesses to decree against\r\nthe veto of the tribune that the public property should be distributed\r\namong them, he struck a vital blow on the constitution of his country, and\r\nmade a step toward monarchy, for monarchy was only reached through the\r\ndemocracy—was only brought about by powerful demagogues. And hence the\r\nverdict of the wise and judicious will be precisely that, of the leading\r\nmen of Rome at the time, even that of Cornelia herself: “Shall then our\r\nhouse have no end of madness? Have we not enough to be ashamed of in the\r\ndisorganization of the State?”\r\n\r\n(M945) The law of Tiberius Gracchus survived its author. The Senate had\r\nnot power to annul it, though it might slay its author. The work of\r\nredistribution continued, even as the National Assembly of France\r\nsanctioned the legislation of preceding revolutionists. And in consequence\r\nof the law, there was, in six years, an increase of burgesses capable of\r\nbearing arms, of seventy-six thousand. But so many evils attended the\r\nconfiscation and redistribution of the public domain—so many acts of\r\ninjustice were perpetrated—there was such gross mismanagement, that the\r\nconsul Scipio Æmilianus intervened, and by a decree of the people, through\r\nhis influence, the commission was withdrawn, and the matter was left to\r\nthe consuls to adjudicate, which was virtually the suspension of the law\r\nitself. For this intervention Scipio lost his popularity, unbounded as it\r\nhad been, even as Daniel Webster lost his prestige and influence when he\r\nmade his 7th of March speech—the fate of all great men, however great,\r\nwhen they oppose popular feelings and interests, whether they are right or\r\nwrong. Scipio, the hero of three wars, not only lost his popularity, but\r\nhis life. He was found murdered in his bed at the age of fifty-six.\r\n“Scipio’s assassination was the democratic reply to the aristocratic\r\nmassacre of Tiberius Gracchus.” The greatest general of the age, a man of\r\nunspotted moral purity, and political unselfishness, and generous\r\npatriotism, could not escape the vengeance of a baffled populace, B.C.\r\n129.\r\n\r\n(M946) The distribution of land ceased, but the revolution did not stop.\r\nThe soul of Tiberius Gracchus “was marching on.” A new hero appeared in\r\nhis brother, Gaius Gracchus, nine years younger—a man who had no relish\r\nfor vulgar pleasures,—brave, cultivated, talented, energetic, vehement. A\r\nmaster of eloquence, he drew the people; consumed with a passion for\r\nrevenge, he led them on to revolutionary measures. He was elected tribune\r\nin the year 123, and at once declared war on the aristocratic party, to\r\nwhich by birth he belonged.\r\n\r\nHe inaugurated revolutionary measures, by proposing to the people a law\r\nwhich should allow the tribune to solicit a re-election. He then, to gain\r\nthe people and secure material power, enacted that every burgess should be\r\nallowed, monthly, a definite quantity of corn from the public stores at\r\nabout half the average price. And he caused a law to be passed that the\r\nexisting order of voting in the Comitia Centuriata, according to which the\r\nfive property classes voted first, should be done away with, and that all\r\nthe centuries should vote in the order to be determined by lot. He also\r\ncaused a law to be passed that no citizen should enlist in the army till\r\nseventeen, nor be compelled to serve in the army more than twenty years.\r\nThese measures all had the effect to elevate the democracy.\r\n\r\n(M947) He also sought to depress the aristocracy, by dividing its ranks.\r\nThe old aristocracy embraced chiefly the governing class, and were the\r\nchief possessors of landed property. But a new aristocracy of the rich had\r\ngrown up, composed of speculators, who managed the mercantile transactions\r\nof the Roman world. The old senatorial aristocracy were debarred by the\r\nClaudian ordinance from mercantile pursuits, and were merely sleeping\r\npartners in the great companies, managed by the speculators. But the new\r\naristocracy, under the name of the equestrian order, began at this time to\r\nhave political influence. Originally, the equestrians were a burgess\r\ncavalry; but gradually all who possessed estates of four hundred thousand\r\nsesterces were liable to cavalry service, and became enrolled in the\r\norder, which thus comprehended the whole senatorial and non-senatorial\r\nnoble society of Rome. In process of time, the senators were exempted from\r\ncavalry service, and were thus marked off from the list of those liable to\r\ndo cavalry service. The equestrian order then, at last, comprehended the\r\naristocracy of rich men, in contradistinction from the Senate. And a\r\nnatural antipathy accordingly grew up between the old senatorial\r\naristocracy and the men to whom money had given rank. The ruling lords\r\nstood aloof from the speculators; and were better friends of the people\r\nthan the new moneyed aristocrats, since they, brought directly in contact\r\nwith the people, oppressed them, and their greediness and injustice were\r\nnot usually countenanced by the Senate. The two classes of nobles had\r\nunited to put down Tiberius Gracchus; but a deep gulf still yawned between\r\nthem, for no class of aristocrats was ever more exclusive than the\r\ngoverning class at Rome, confined chiefly to the Senate. The Roman Senate\r\nwas like the House of Peers in England, when the peers had a\r\npreponderating political power, and whose property lay in landed estates.\r\n\r\n(M948) Gracchus raised the power of the equestrians by a law which\r\nprovided that the farming of the taxes raised in the provinces should be\r\nsold at auction at Rome. A gold mine was thus opened for the speculators.\r\nHe also caused a law to be passed which required the judges of civil and\r\ncriminal cases to be taken from the equestrians, a privilege before\r\nenjoyed by the Senate. And thus a senator, impeached for his conduct as\r\nprovincial governor, was now tried, not as before, by his peer, but by\r\nmerchants and bankers.\r\n\r\n(M949) Gracchus, by the aid of the proletarians and the mercantile class,\r\nthen proceeded to the overthrow of the ruling aristocracy, especially in\r\nthe functions of legislation, which had belonged to the Senate. By means\r\nof comitial laws and tribunician dictation, he restricted the business of\r\nthe Senate. He meddled with the public chest by distributing corn at half\r\nits value; he meddled with the domains by sending colonies by decrees of\r\nthe people; he meddled with provincial administration by overturning the\r\nregulations which had been made by the Senate. He also sought to\r\nre-enforce the Senate by three hundred new members from the equestrians\r\nelected by the comitia, a creation of peers which would have reduced the\r\nSenate to dependence on the chief of the State. But this he did not\r\nsucceed in effecting.\r\n\r\n(M950) It is singular that he could have carried these measures during his\r\nterm of office, two years, for he was re-elected, with so little\r\nopposition—a proof of the power of the moneyed classes, such, perhaps, as\r\nare now represented by the Commons of England. The great change he sought\r\nto effect was the re-election of magistrates—an unlimited tribuneship,\r\nwhich was truly Napoleonic. And he knew what he was doing. He was not a\r\nfanatic, but a Statesman of great ability, seeking to break the oligarchy,\r\nand transfer its powers to the tribunes of the people. He desired a firm\r\nadministration, but resting on continuous individual usurpations. He was a\r\npolitical incendiary, like Mirabeau. He was the true founder of that\r\nterrible civic proletariate, which, flattered by the classes above it, led\r\nto the usurpations of Sulla and Cæsar. He is the author of the great\r\nchange, which in one hundred years was effected, of transferring power\r\nfrom the Senate to an emperor. He furnished the tactics for all succeeding\r\ndemagogues.\r\n\r\n(M951) Great revolutionists are doomed to experience the loss of\r\npopularity, and Gracchus lost his by an attempt to extend the Roman\r\nfranchise to the people of the provinces. The Senate and the mob here\r\nunited to prevent what was ultimately effected. The Senate seized the\r\nadvantage by inciting a rival demagogue, in the person of Marcus Livius\r\nDrusus, to propose laws which gave still greater privileges to the\r\nequestrians. The Senate bid for popularity, as English prime ministers\r\nhave retained place, by granting more to the people than their rivals\r\nwould have granted. The Livian laws, which released the proletarians from\r\npaying rent for their lands, were ratified by the people as readily as the\r\nSempronian laws had been. The foundation of the despotism of Gracchus was\r\nthus assailed by the Senate uniting with the proletarians. An opportunity\r\nwas only wanted to effect his complete overthrow.\r\n\r\n(M952) On the expiration of two years, Gracchus ceased to be tribune, and\r\nhis enemy, Lucius Opimius, a stanch aristocrat, entered upon his office.\r\nThe attack on the ex-tribune was made by prohibiting the restoration of\r\nCarthage, which Gracchus had sought to effect, and which was a popular\r\nmeasure. On the day when the burgesses assembled with a view to reject the\r\nmeasure which Gracchus had previously secured, he appeared with a large\r\nbody of adherents. An attendant on the consul demanded their dispersion,\r\non which he was cut down by a zealous Gracchian. On this, a tumult arose.\r\nGracchus in vain sought to be heard, and even interrupted a tribune in the\r\nact of speaking, which was against an obsolete law. This offense furnished\r\na pretense for the Senate and the citizens to arm. Gracchus retired to the\r\ntemple of Castor, and passed the night, while the capitol was filled with\r\narmed men. The next day, he fled beyond the Tiber, but the Senate placed a\r\nprice upon his head, and he was overtaken and slain. Three thousand of his\r\nadherents were strangled in prison, and the memory of the Gracchi remained\r\nofficially proscribed. But Cornelia put on mourning for her last son, and\r\nhis name became embalmed in the hearts of the democracy.\r\n\r\n(M953) Thus perished Gaius Gracchus, a wiser man than his brother—a man\r\nwho attempted greater changes, and did not defy the constitutional forms.\r\nHe was, undoubtedly, patriotic in his intentions, but the reforms which he\r\nprojected were radical, and would have changed the whole structure of\r\ngovernment. It was the consummation of the war against the patrician\r\noligarchy. Whether wise or foolish, it is not for me to give an opinion,\r\nsince such an opinion is of no account, and would imply equally a judgment\r\nas to the relative value of an aristocratical or democratic form of\r\ngovernment, in a corrupt age of Roman society. This is a mooted point, and\r\nI am not capable of settling it. The efforts of the Gracchi to weaken the\r\npower of the ruling noble houses formed a precedent for subsequent\r\nreforms, or usurpations, as they are differently regarded, and led the way\r\nto the rule of demagogues, to be supplanted in time by that of emperors,\r\nwith unbounded military authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WARS WITH JUGURTHA AND THE CIMBRI.—MARIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Gracchi restored Rome to the rule of the oligarchy. The\r\ngovernment of the Senate was resumed, and a war of prosecution was carried\r\non against the followers of Gracchus. His measures were allowed to drop.\r\nThe claims of the Italian allies were disregarded, the noblest of all the\r\nschemes of the late tribune, that of securing legal equality between the\r\nRoman burgesses and their Italian allies. The restoration of Carthage was\r\nset aside. Italian colonies were broken up. The allotment commission was\r\nabolished, and a fixed rent was imposed on the occupants of the public\r\ndomains, but the proletariate of the capital continued to have a\r\ndistribution of corn, and jurymen or judges (_judices_) were still\r\nselected from the mercantile classes. The Senate continued to be composed\r\nof effeminated nobles, and insignificant persons were raised to the\r\nhighest offices.\r\n\r\nThe administration, under the restoration, was feeble and unpopular.\r\nSocial evils spread with alarming rapidity. Both slavery and great\r\nfortunes increased. The provinces were miserably governed, while pirates\r\nand robbers pillaged the countries around the Mediterranean. There was a\r\ngreat revolt of slaves in Sicily, who gained, for a time, the mastery of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n(M954) While public affairs were thus disgracefully managed, a war broke\r\nout between Numidia and Rome. That African kingdom extended from the river\r\nMolochath to the great Syrtis on the one hand, and to Cyrene and Egypt on\r\nthe other, and included the greatest part of the ancient Carthaginian\r\nterritories. Numidia, next to Egypt, was the most important of the Roman\r\nclient States. On the fall of Carthage, it was ruled by the eldest son of\r\nMasinassa, Micipsa, a feeble old man, who devoted himself to the study of\r\nphilosophy, rather than affairs of State. The government was really in the\r\nhands of his nephew, Jugurtha, courageous, sagacious, and able. He was\r\nadopted by Micipsa, to rule in conjunction with his two sons, Adherbal and\r\nHiempsal. In the year B.C. 118 Micipsa died, and a collision arose, as was\r\nto be expected, among his heirs. Hiempsal was assassinated, and the\r\nstruggle for the Numidian crown lay between Adherbal and Jugurtha. The\r\nlatter seized the whole territory, and Adherbal escaped to Rome, and laid\r\nhis complaint before the Senate. Jugurtha’s envoys also appeared, and the\r\nSenate decreed that the two heirs should have the kingdom equally divided\r\nbetween them, but Jugurtha obtained the more fertile western half.\r\n\r\nThen war arose between the two kings, and Adherbal was defeated, and\r\nretired to his capital, Aita, where he was besieged by Jugurtha. Adherbal\r\nmade his complaints to Rome, and a commission of aristocratic but\r\ninexperienced young men came to the camp of Jugurtha to arrange the\r\ndifficulties. Jugurtha rejected their demands, and the young men returned\r\nhome. Adherbal sent again messengers to Rome, being closely pressed,\r\ndemanding intervention. The Senate then sent Marcus Scaurus, who held\r\nendless debates with Jugurtha, at Utica, to which place he was summoned.\r\nThese were not attended with any results. Scaurus returned to Rome, and\r\nJugurtha pressed the siege of Aita, which soon capitulated. Adherbal was\r\nexecuted with cruel torture, and the adult population was put to the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nA cry of indignation arose in Italy. The envoys of Jugurtha were summarily\r\ndismissed, and Scaurus was sent to Africa with an army, but a peace with\r\nRome was purchased by the African prince through the bribery of the\r\ngenerals. The legal validity of the peace was violently assailed in the\r\nSenate, and Massiva, a grandson of Masinissa, then in Rome, laid claim to\r\nthe Numidian throne. But this prince was assassinated by one of the\r\nconfidants of Jugurtha, which outrage, perpetrated under the eyes of the\r\nRoman government, led to a renewed declaration of war, and Spurius Albinus\r\nwas intrusted with the command of an army. But Jugurtha bribed the Roman\r\ngeneral into inaction, and captured the Roman camp. This resulted in the\r\nevacuation of Numidia, and a second treaty of peace.\r\n\r\n(M955) Such an ignoble war created intense dissatisfaction at Rome, and\r\nthe Senate was obliged to cancel the treaty, and renewed the war in\r\nearnest, intrusting the conduct of it to Quintus Metellus, an aristocrat,\r\nof course, but a man of great ability. Selecting for his lieutenants able\r\ngenerals, he led over his army to Africa. Jugurtha made proposals of\r\npeace, which were refused, and he prepared for a desperate defense.\r\nIntrenched on a ridge of hills in the wide plain of Muthul, he awaited the\r\nattack of his enemies, but was signally defeated by Metellus, assisted by\r\nMarius, a brave plebeian, who had arisen from the common soldiers. After\r\nthis battle Jugurtha contented himself with a guerrilla warfare, while his\r\nkingdom was occupied by the conquerors. Metellus even intrigued to secure\r\nthe assassination of the king.\r\n\r\n(M956) The war continued to be prosecuted without decisive results, as is\r\nso frequently the case when civilized nations fight with barbarians. Like\r\nthe war of Charlemagne against the Saxons, victories were easily obtained,\r\nbut the victors gained unsubstantial advantages. Jugurtha retired to\r\ninaccessible deserts with his children, his treasures, and his best\r\ntroops, to await better times. Numidia was seemingly reduced, but its king\r\nremained in arms.\r\n\r\n(M957) It was then, in the third year of the renewed war, that Metellus\r\nwas recalled, and Marius, chosen consul, was left with the supreme\r\ncommand. But even he did not find it easy, with a conquering army, to\r\nseize Jugurtha, and he was restricted to a desultory war. At last Bocchus,\r\nking of Mauritania, slighted by the Romans, but in alliance with Jugurtha,\r\neffected by treachery what could not be gained by arms. He entered into\r\nnegotiations with Marius to deliver up the king of Numidia, who had\r\nmarried his daughter, and had sought his protection. Marius sent Sulla to\r\nconsummate the treachery. Jugurtha, the traitor, was thus in turn\r\nsacrificed, and became a Roman prisoner.\r\n\r\n(M958) This miserable war lasted seven years, and its successful\r\ntermination secured to Marius a splendid triumph, at which the conquered\r\nking, with his two sons, appeared in chains before the triumphal car, and\r\nwas then executed in the subterranean prison on the Capitoline Hill.\r\n\r\n(M959) Numidia was not converted into a Roman province, but into a client\r\nState, because the country could not be held without an army on the\r\nfrontiers. The Jugurthan war was important in its consequences, since it\r\nbrought to light the venality of the governing lords, and made it evident\r\nthat Rome must be governed by a degenerate and selfish oligarchy, or by a\r\ntyrant, whether in the form of a demagogue, like Gracchus, or a military\r\nchieftain, like Marius.\r\n\r\n(M960) But a more difficult war than that waged against the barbarians of\r\nthe African deserts was now to be conducted against the barbarians of\r\nEuropean forests. The war with the Cimbri was also more important in its\r\npolitical results. There had been several encounters with the northern\r\nnations of Spain, Gaul, and Italy, under different names, with different\r\nsuccesses, which it would be tedious to describe. But the contest with the\r\nCimbri has a great and historic interest, since they were the first of the\r\nGermanic tribes with which the Romans contended. Mommsen thinks these\r\nbarbarians were Teutonic, although, among older historians, they were\r\nsupposed to be Celts. The Cimbri were a migratory people, who left their\r\nnorthern homes with their wives and children, goods and chattels, to seek\r\nmore congenial settlements than they had found in the Scandinavian\r\nforests. The wagon was their house. They were tall, fair-haired, with\r\nbright blue eyes. They were well armed with sword, spear, shield, and\r\nhelmet. They were brave warriors, careless of danger, and willing to die.\r\nThey were accompanied by priestesses, whose warnings were regarded as\r\nvoices from heaven.\r\n\r\n(M961) This homeless people of the Cimbri, prevented from advancing south\r\non the Danube by the barrier raised by the Celts, advanced to the passes\r\nof the Carnian Alps, B.C. 113, protected by Gnæus Papirius Carbo, not far\r\nfrom Aquileia. An engagement took place not far from the modern Corinthia,\r\nwhere Carbo was defeated. Some years after, they proceeded westward to the\r\nleft bank of the Rhine, and over the Jura, and again threatened the Roman\r\nterritory. Again was a Roman army defeated under Silanus in Southern Gaul,\r\nand the Cimbri sent envoys to Rome, with the request that they might be\r\nallowed peaceful settlements. The Helvetii, stimulated by the successes of\r\nthe Cimbri, also sought more fertile settlements in Western Gaul, and\r\nformed an alliance with the Cimbri. They crossed the Jura, the western\r\nbarrier of Switzerland, succeeded in decoying the Roman army under\r\nLonginus into an ambush, and gained a victory.\r\n\r\n(M962) In the year B.C., 105 the Cimbrians, under their king Boiorix,\r\nadvanced to the invasion of Italy. They were opposed on the right bank of\r\nthe Rhone by the proconsul Cæpio, and on the left by the consul Gnæus\r\nMallius Maximus, and the consular Marcus Aurelius Scaurus. The first\r\nattack fell on the latter general, who was taken prisoner and his corps\r\nrouted. Maximus then ordered his colleague to bring his army across the\r\nRhone, where the Roman force stood confronting the whole Cimbrian army,\r\nbut Cæpio refused. The mutual jealousy of these generals, and refusal to\r\nco-operate, led to one of the most disastrous defeats which the Romans\r\never suffered. No less than eighty thousand soldiers, and half as many\r\nmore camp followers, perished. The battle of Aransio (Orange) filled Rome\r\nwith alarm and fear, and had the Cimbrians immediately advanced through\r\nthe passes of the Alps to Italy, overwhelming disasters might have ensued.\r\n\r\n(M963) In this crisis, Marius was called to the supreme command, hated as\r\nhe was by the aristocracy, which still ruled, and in defiance of the law\r\nwhich prohibited the holding of the consulship more than once. He was\r\naccompanied by a still greater man, Lucius Sulla, destined to acquire\r\ngreat distinction. Marius maintained a strictly defensive attitude within\r\nthe Roman territories, training and disciplining his troops for the\r\ncontest which was yet to come with the most formidable antagonists the\r\nRomans had ever encountered, and who were destined in after times to\r\nsubvert the empire.\r\n\r\n(M964) The Cimbri formed a confederation with the Helvetii and the\r\nTeutons, and after an unsuccessful attempt to sweep away the Belgæ, who\r\nresisted them, concluded to invade Italy, through Roman Gaul and the\r\nWestern passes of the Alps. They crossed the Rhone without difficulty, and\r\nresumed the struggle with the Romans. Marius awaited them in a well-chosen\r\ncamp, well fortified and provisioned, at the confluence of the Rhone and\r\nthe Isère, by which he intercepted the passage of the barbarians, either\r\nover the Little St. Barnard—the route Hannibal had taken—or along the\r\ncoast. The barbarians attacked the camp, but were repulsed. They then\r\nresolved to pass the camp, leaving an enemy in the rear, and march to\r\nItaly. Marius, for six days, permitted them to defile with their immense\r\nbaggage, and when their march was over, followed in the steps of the\r\nenemy, who took the coast road. At Aquæ Sextiæ the contending parties came\r\ninto collision, and the barbarians were signally defeated; the whole horde\r\nwas scattered, killed, or taken prisoners. It would seem that these\r\nbarbarians were Teutons or Germans; but on the south side of the Alps, the\r\nCimbri and Helvetii crossed the Alps by the Brenner Pass, and descended\r\nupon the plains of Italy. The passes had been left unguarded, and the\r\nRoman army, under Catulus, on the banks of the Adige, suffered a defeat,\r\nand retreated to the right bank of the Po. The whole plain between the Po\r\nand the Alps was in the hands of the barbarians, who did not press\r\nforward, as they should have done, but retired into winter quarters, where\r\nthey became demoralized by the warm baths and abundant stores of that\r\nfertile and lovely region. Thus the Romans gained time, and the victorious\r\nMarius, relinquishing all attempts at the conquest of Gaul, conducted his\r\narmy to the banks of the Po, and formed a junction with Catulus.\r\n\r\n(M965) The two armies met at Vercillæ, not far from the place where\r\nHannibal had fought his first battle on the Italian soil. The day of the\r\nbattle was fixed beforehand by the barbaric general and Marius, on the\r\n30th of June, B.C. 101. A complete victory was gained by the Romans, and\r\nthe Cimbri were annihilated. The victory of the rough plebeian farmer was\r\nnot merely over the barbarians, but over the aristocracy. He became, in\r\nconsequence, the leading man in Rome. He had fought his way from the ranks\r\nto the consulship, and had distinguished himself in all the campaigns in\r\nwhich he fought. In Spain, he had arisen to the grade of an officer. In\r\nthe Numantine war he attracted, at twenty-three, the notice of Scipio. On\r\nhis return to Rome, with his honorable scars and military _éclat_, he\r\nmarried a lady of the great patrician house of the Julii. At forty, he\r\nobtained the prætorship; at forty-eight, he was made consul, and\r\nterminated the African war, and his victories over the Cimbri and Teutons\r\nenabled him to secure his re-election five consecutive years, which was\r\nunexampled in the history of the republic. As consul he administered\r\njustice impartially, organized the military system, and maintained in the\r\narmy the strictest discipline. He had but little culture; his voice was\r\nharsh, and his look wild. But he was simple, economical, and\r\nincorruptible. He stood aloof from society and from political parties,\r\nexposed to the sarcasms of the aristocrats into whose ranks he had\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n(M966) He made great military reforms, changing the burgess levy into a\r\nsystem of enlistments, and allowing every free-born citizen to enlist. He\r\nabolished the aristocratic classification, reduced the infantry of the\r\nline to a level, and raised the number of the legion from four thousand\r\ntwo hundred to six thousand, to which he gave a new standard—the silver\r\neagle, which proclaims the advent of emperors. The army was changed from a\r\nmilitia to a band of mercenaries.\r\n\r\nAfter effecting these military changes, he sought political supremacy by\r\ntaking upon himself the constitutional magistracies. In effecting this he\r\nwas supported by the popular, or democratic party, which now regained its\r\npolitical importance. He, therefore, obtained the consulship for the sixth\r\ntime, while his friends among the popular party were made tribunes and\r\nprætors. He was also supported at the election by his old soldiers who had\r\nbeen discharged.\r\n\r\nBut the whole aristocracy rallied, and Marius was not sufficiently a\r\npolitician to cope with experienced demagogues. He made numerous blunders,\r\nand lost his political influence. But he accepted his position, and waited\r\nfor his time. Not in the field of politics was he to arise to power, but\r\nin the strife and din of arms. An opportunity was soon afforded in the\r\nconvulsions which arose from the revolt of the Roman allies in Italy, soon\r\nfollowed by civil wars. It is these wars which next claim our notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLT OF ITALY, AND THE SOCIAL WAR.—MARIUS AND SULLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat discontent had long existed among the Italian subjects of Rome. They\r\nwere not only oppressed, but they enjoyed no political privileges. They\r\ndid not belong to the class of burgesses.\r\n\r\nWith the view of extending the Roman franchise, a movement was made by the\r\ntribune, M. Livius Drusus, an aristocrat of great wealth and popular\r\nsympathies. He had, also, projected other reforms, which made him\r\nobnoxious to all parties; but this was peculiarly offensive to the order\r\nto which he belonged, and he lost his life while attempting to effect the\r\nsame reforms which were fatal to Gracchus.\r\n\r\nOn his assassination, the allies, who outnumbered the Roman burgesses, and\r\nwho had vainly been seeking citizenship, found that they must continue\r\nwithout political rights, or fight, and they made accordingly vast\r\npreparations for war. Had all the Italian States been united, they would,\r\nprobably, have obtained their desire without a conflict in the field, but\r\nin those parts where the moneyed classes preponderated, the people\r\nremained loyal to Rome. But the insurgents embraced most of the people in\r\nCentral and Southern Italy, who were chiefly farmers.\r\n\r\n(M967) The insurrection broke out in Asculum in Picenum, and spread\r\nrapidly through Samnium, Apulia, and Lucania. All Southern and Central\r\nItaly was soon in arms against Rome. The Etruscans and Umbrians remained\r\nin allegiance as they had before taken part with the equestrians, now a\r\nmost powerful body, against Drusus. Italy was divided into two great\r\nmilitary camps. The insurgents sent envoys to Rome, with the proposal to\r\nlay down their arms if citizenship were granted them, but this was\r\nrefused. Both sides now made extensive preparations, and the forces were\r\nnearly balanced. One hundred thousand men were in arms, in two divisions,\r\non either side, the Romans commanded by the consul, Publius Rutilius\r\nLupus, and the Italians by Quintus Silo and Gaius Papius Mutilus. Gaius\r\nMarius served as a lieutenant-commander. The war was carried on with\r\nvarious successes, for “Greek met Greek.” The first campaign proved, on\r\nthe whole, to the disadvantage of the Romans, who suffered several\r\ndefeats. In a political point of view, also, the insurgents were the\r\ngainers. Great despondency reigned in the capital, for the war had become\r\nserious. At length, it was resolved to grant the political franchise to\r\nsuch Italians as had remained faithful, or who had submitted. This\r\nconcession, great as it was, did not include the actual insurgents, but it\r\noperated in strengthening wavering communities on the side of Rome.\r\nEtruria and Umbria were tranquilized.\r\n\r\n(M968) The second campaign, B.C. 89, was opened in Bicenum. Marius was not\r\nin the field. His conduct in the previous campaign was not satisfactory,\r\nand the conqueror of the Cimbri, at sixty-six, was thought to be in his\r\ndotage. Asculum was besieged and taken by the Romans, who had seventy-five\r\nthousand troops under the walls. The Sabellians and Marsians were next\r\nsubjugated, and all Campania was lost to the insurgents, as far as Nola.\r\nThe Southern army was under the command of the consul, Lucius Sulla, whose\r\ngreat career had commenced in Africa, under Marius. Sulla advanced into\r\nthe Samnite country and took its capital, Bovianum. Under his able\r\ngeneralship, the position of affairs greatly changed. At the close of the\r\ncampaign, most of the insurgent regions were subdued. The Samnites were\r\nalmost the only people which held out.\r\n\r\n(M969) It was fortunate for Rome that the rebellion was so far suppressed\r\nwhen the flames of war were rekindled in the East. A great reaction\r\nagainst the Roman domination had taken place, and the eastern nations\r\nseemed determined to rally once more for independent dominion. This was\r\nthe last great Asiatic rising till the fall of the Roman empire. The\r\npotentate under whom the Oriental forces rallied, was Mithridates, king of\r\nPontus.\r\n\r\n(M970) The army of Sulla, in Campania, was destined to embark for Asia as\r\nsoon as the state of things in Southern Italy should allow his departure.\r\nSo the third campaign of the Social war, as it is called, began favorably\r\nfor Rome, when events transpired in the capital which gave fresh life to\r\nthe almost extinguished insurrection. The attack of Drusus on the\r\nequestrian courts, and his sudden downfall, had sown the bitterest discord\r\nbetween the aristocracy and the burgess class. The Italian communities,\r\nreceived into Roman citizenship, were fettered by restrictions which had\r\nan odious stigma, which led to great irritation, for the aristocracy had\r\nconferred the franchise grudgingly. And this franchise was moreover\r\nwithheld from the insurgent communities which had again submitted. A deep\r\nindignation also settled in the breast of Marius, on his return from the\r\nfirst campaign, to find himself neglected and forgotten. To these\r\ndiscontents were added the distress of debtors, who, amid the financial\r\ntroubles of the war, were unable to pay the interest on their debts, and\r\nwere yet inexorably pressed by creditors.\r\n\r\n(M971) It was then, in this state of fermentation and demoralization, that\r\nthe tribune Publius Sulpicius Rufus proposed that every senator who owed\r\nmore than two thousand denarii (£82) should forfeit his seat in the\r\nSenate; that burgesses condemned by non-free jury courts should have\r\nliberty to return home; and that the new burgesses should be distributed\r\namong all the tribes, in which the freed men should also have the\r\nprivilege of voting. These proposals, although made by a patrician, met\r\nwith the greatest opposition from the Senate, but were passed amid riots\r\nand tumults. Sulla was on the best terms with the Senate, and Sulpicius\r\nfeared that he might return from his camp at Nola, and take vengeance for\r\nthese popular measures. The tribune, therefore, conceived the plan of\r\ntaking the command from Sulla, who was then consul, and transfer it upon\r\nMarius, who was also to conduct the war against Mithridates, in Asia.\r\n\r\n(M972) Sulla disobeyed the mandate, and marched to Rome with his\r\narmy—little more than a body of mercenaries devoted to him. In his eyes,\r\nthe sovereign Roman citizens were a rabble, and Rome itself a city without\r\na garrison. Sulla had an army of thirty-five thousand men, and before the\r\nRomans could organize resistance he appeared at the gate, and crossed the\r\nsacred boundary which the law had forbidden war to enter. In a few hours\r\nSulla was the absolute master of Rome. Marius and Sulpicius fled. It was\r\nthe conservative party which exchanged the bludgeon for the sword. Sulla\r\nat once made null the Sulpician laws, punished their author and his\r\nadherents, as Sulpicius had feared. The gray-haired conqueror of the\r\nCimbri fled, and found his way to the coast and embarked on a\r\ntrading-vessel, but the timid mariners put him ashore, and Marius stole\r\nalong the beach with his pursuers in the rear. He was found in a marsh\r\nconcealed in reeds and mud, seized and imprisoned by the people of\r\nMinturnæ, and a Cimbrian slave was sent to put him to death, The ax,\r\nhowever, fell from his hands when the old hero demanded in a stern voice\r\nif he dared to kill Gaius Marius. The magistrates of the town, ashamed,\r\nthen loosed his fetters, gave him a vessel, and sent him to Ænaria\r\n(Ischia). There, in those waters, the proscribed met, and escaped to\r\nNumidia, and Sulla was spared the odium of putting to death his old\r\ncommander, who had delivered Rome from the Cimbrians.\r\n\r\n(M973) Sulla, master of Rome, did not destroy her liberties. He suggested\r\na new series of legislative enactments in the interests of the\r\naristocracy. He created three hundred new senators, and brought back the\r\nold Servian rule of voting in the Comitia Centuriata. The poorer classes\r\nwere thus virtually again disfranchised. He also abolished the power of\r\nthe tribune to propose laws to the people, and the initiatory of\r\nlegislation was submitted to the Senate. The absurd custom by which a\r\nconsul, prætor, or tribune, could propose to the burgesses any measure he\r\npleased, and carry it without debate, was in itself enough to overturn any\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nHaving settled these difficulties, and made way with his enemies, Sulla,\r\nstill consul, embarked with his legion for the East, where the presence of\r\na Roman army was imperatively needed. But before he left, he extorted a\r\nsolemn oath from Cinna, consul elect, that he would attempt no alteration\r\nin the recent changes which had been made. Cinna took the oath, but Sulla\r\nhad scarcely left before he created new disturbances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MITHRIDATIC AND CIVIL WARS.—MARIUS AND SULLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere reigned at this time in Pontus, the northeastern State of Asia\r\nMinor, bordered on the south by Cappadocia, on the east by Armenia, and\r\nthe north by the Euxine, a powerful prince, Mithridates VI., surnamed\r\nEupator, who traced an unbroken lineage to Darius, the son of the\r\nHystaspes, and also to the Seleucidæ. He was a great eastern hero, whose\r\ndeeds excited the admiration of his age. He could, on foot, overtake the\r\nswiftest deer; he accomplished journeys on horseback of one hundred and\r\ntwenty miles a day; he drove sixteen horses in hand at the chariot races;\r\nhe never missed his aim in hunting; he drank his boon companions under the\r\ntable; he had as many mistresses as Solomon; he was fond of music and\r\npoetry; he collected precious works of art; he had philosophers and poets\r\nin his train; he was the greatest jester and wit of his court. His\r\nactivity was boundless; he learned the antidotes for all poisons; he\r\nadministered justice in twenty-two languages; and yet he was coarse,\r\ntyrannical, cruel, superstitious, and unscrupulous. Such was this\r\nextraordinary man who led the great reaction of the Asiatics against the\r\nOccidentals.\r\n\r\n(M974) The resources of this Oriental king were immense, since he bore\r\nrule over the shores of the Euxine to the interior of Asia Minor. His\r\nfield for recruits to his armies stretched from the mouth of the Danube to\r\nthe Caspian Sea. Thracians, Scythians, Colchians, Iberians, crowded under\r\nhis banners. When he marched into Cappadocia, he had six hundred scythed\r\nchariots, ten thousand horse, and eighty thousand foot. A series of\r\naggressions and conquests made this monarch the greatest and most\r\nformidable Eastern foe the Romans ever encountered. The Romans, engrossed\r\nwith the war with the Cimbri and the insurrection of their Italian\r\nsubjects, allowed his empire to be silently aggrandized.\r\n\r\n(M975) The Roman Senate, at last, disturbed and jealous, sent Lucius Sulla\r\nto Cappadocia with a handful of troops to defend its interests. On his\r\nreturn, Mithridates continued his aggressions, and formed an alliance with\r\nhis father-in-law, Tigranes, king of Armenia, but avoided a direct\r\nencounter with the great Occidental power which had conquered the world.\r\nThings continued for awhile between war and peace, but, at last, it was\r\nevident that only war could prevent the aggrandizement of Mithridates, and\r\nit was resolved upon by the Romans.\r\n\r\n(M976) The king of Pontus made immense preparations to resist his powerful\r\nenemies. He strengthened his alliance with Tigranes. He made overtures to\r\nthe Greek cities. He attempted to excite a revolt in Thrace, in Numidia,\r\nand in Syria. He encouraged pirates on the Mediterranean. He organized a\r\nforeign corps after the Roman fashion, and took the field with two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand infantry and forty thousand cavalry—the largest army\r\nseen since the Persian wars. He then occupied Asia Minor, and the Roman\r\ngenerals retreated as he advanced. He made Ephesus his head-quarters, and\r\nissued orders to all the governors dependent upon him to massacre, on the\r\nsame day, all Italians, free or enslaved—men, women, and children, found\r\nin their cities. One hundred and fifty thousand were thus barbarously\r\nslaughtered in one day. The States of Cappadocia, Sinope, Phrygia, and\r\nBithynia were organized as Pontic satrapies. The confiscation of the\r\nproperty of the murdered Italians replenished his treasury, as well as the\r\ncontributions of Asia Minor. He not only occupied the Asiatic provinces of\r\nthe Romans, but meditated the invasion of Europe. Thrace and Macedonia\r\nwere occupied by his armies, and his fleet appeared in the Ægean Sea.\r\nDelos, the emporium of Roman commerce, was taken, and twenty thousand\r\nItalians massacred. Most of the small free States of Greece entered into\r\nalliance with him—the Achæans, Laconians, and Bœotians. So commanding was\r\nhis position, that an embassy of Italian insurgents invited him to land in\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Roman government was critical. Asia Minor, Hellas, and\r\nMacedonia were in the hands of Mithridates, while his fleet sailed without\r\na rival. The Italian insurrection was not subdued, and political parties\r\ndivided the capital.\r\n\r\n(M977) At this crisis Sulla landed on the coast of Epirus, but with an\r\narmy of only thirty thousand men, and without a single vessel of war. He\r\nlanded with an empty military chest. But he was a second Alexander—the\r\ngreatest general that Rome had yet produced. He soon made himself master\r\nof Greece, with the exception of the fortresses of Athens and the Piræus,\r\ninto which the generals of Mithridates had thrown themselves. He\r\nintrenched himself at Eleusis and Megara, from which he commanded Greece\r\nand the Peloponnesus, and commenced the siege of Athena. This was attended\r\nwith great difficulties, and the city only fell, after a protracted\r\ndefense, when provisions were exhausted. The conqueror, after allowing his\r\nsoldiers to pillage the city, gave back her liberties, in honor of her\r\nillustrious dead.\r\n\r\n(M978) But a year was wasted, and without ships it was impossible for\r\nSulla to secure his communications. He sent one of his best officers,\r\nLucullus, to Alexandria, to raise a fleet, but the Egyptian court evaded\r\nthe request. To add to his embarrassments, the Roman general was without\r\nmoney, although he had rifled the treasures which still remained in the\r\nGrecian temples. Moreover, what was still more serious, a revolution at\r\nRome overturned his work, and he had been deposed, and his Asiatic command\r\ngiven to M. Valerius Flaccus.\r\n\r\nSulla was unexpectedly relieved by the resolution of Mithridates to carry\r\non the offensive in Greece. Taxiles, one of the lieutenants of the Pontic\r\nking, was sent to combat Sulla with an army of one hundred thousand\r\ninfantry and ten thousand cavalry.\r\n\r\n(M979) Then was fought the battle of Chæronea, B.C. 86, against the advice\r\nof Archelaus, in which the Romans were the victors. But Sulla could not\r\nreap the fruits of victory without a fleet, since the sea was covered with\r\nPontic ships. In the following year a second army was sent into Greece by\r\nMithridates, and the Romans and Asiatics met once more in the plain of the\r\nCephissus, near Orchomenus. The Romans were the victors, who speedily\r\ncleared the European continent of its eastern invaders. At the end of the\r\nthird year of the war, Sulla took up his winter quarters in Thessaly, and\r\ncommenced to build ships.\r\n\r\n(M980) Meanwhile a reaction against Mithridates took place in Asia Minor.\r\nHis rule was found to be more oppressive than that of the Romans. The\r\ngreat mercantile cities of Smyrna, Colophon, Ephesus, and Sardis were in\r\nrevolt, and closed their gates against his governors. The Hellenic cities\r\nof Asia Minor had hoped to gain civil independence and a remission of\r\ntaxes, and were disappointed. And those cities which were supposed to be\r\nsecretly in favor of the Romans were heavily fined. The Chians were\r\ncompelled to pay two thousand talents. Great cruelties were also added to\r\nfines and confiscations. Lucullus, unable to obtain the help of an\r\nAlexandrian fleet, was more fortunate in the Syrian ports, and soon was\r\nable to commence offensive operations. Flaccus, too, had arrived with a\r\nRoman army, but this incapable general was put to death by a mob-orator,\r\nFimbria, more able than he, who defeated a Pontic army at Miletopolis. The\r\nsituation of Mithridates then became perilous. Europe was lost; Asia Minor\r\nwas in rebellion; and Roman armies were pressing upon him.\r\n\r\n(M981) He therefore negotiated for peace. Sulla required the restoration\r\nof all the conquests he had made: Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, Galatia,\r\nBithynia, the Hellenic cities, the islands of the sea, and a contribution\r\nof three thousand talents. These conditions were not accepted, and Sulla\r\nproceeded to Asia, upon which Mithridates reluctantly acceded to his\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n(M982) Sulla then turned against Fimbria, who commanded the Roman army\r\nsent to supplant him, which, as was to be expected, deserted to his\r\nstandard. Fimbria fled to Pergamus, and fell on his own sword. Sulla\r\nintrusted the two legions which had been sent from Rome under Flaccus to\r\nthe command of his best officer, Murena, and turned his attention to\r\narrange the affairs of Asia. He levied contributions to the amount of\r\ntwenty thousand talents, reduced Mithridates to the rank of a client king,\r\nrichly compensated his soldiers, and embarked for Italy, leaving Lucullus\r\nbehind to collect the contributions.\r\n\r\n(M983) Thus was the Mithridatic war ended by the genius of a Roman\r\ngeneral, who had no equal in Roman history, with the exception of Pompey\r\nand Julius Cæsar. He had distinguished himself in Africa, in Spain, in\r\nItaly, and in Greece. He had defeated the barbarians of the West, the old\r\nItalian foes of Rome, and the armies of the most powerful Oriental monarch\r\nsince the fall of Persia. He had triumphed over Roman factions, and\r\nsupplanted the great Marius himself. He was now to contend with one more\r\nable foe, Lucius Cornelius Cinna, who represented the revolutionary forces\r\nwhich had rallied under the Gracchi and Marius—the democratic elements of\r\nRoman society.\r\n\r\nWhen Sulla embarked for the Mithridatic war, Cinna, supported by a\r\nmajority of the College of Tribunes, concerted a reaction against the rule\r\nwhich Sulla had re-established—the rule of the aristocracy. But Cinna, a\r\nmere tool of the revolutionary party,—a man without ability,—was driven\r\nout of the city by the aristocratic party, and outlawed, and L. Cornelia\r\nMesula was made consul in his stead. The outlaws fled to the camp before\r\nNola. The Campanian army, democratic and revolutionary, recognized Cinna\r\nas the leader of the republic. Gaius Marius, then an exile in Numidia,\r\nbrought six thousand men, whom he had rallied to his standard, to the\r\ndisposal of the consul, and was placed by Cinna in supreme command at\r\nEtruria. A storm gathered around the capitol. Cinna was overshadowed by\r\nthe greatness of that plebeian general who had defeated the Cimbrians, and\r\nwho was bent upon revenge for the mortification and insults he had\r\nreceived from the Roman aristocracy. Famine and desertion soon made the\r\ncity indefensible, and Rome capitulated to an army of her own citizens.\r\n\r\n(M984) Marius, now master of Rome, entered the city, and a reign of terror\r\ncommenced. The gates were closed, and the slaughter of the aristocratic\r\nparty commenced. The consul Octavius was the first victim, and with him\r\nthe most illustrious of his party. The executioners of Marius fulfilled\r\nhis orders, and his revenge was complete. He entered upon a new consulate,\r\nexecrated by all the leading citizens. But in the midst of his victories\r\nhe was seized with a burning fever, and died in agonies, at the age of\r\nseventy, in the full possession of honor and power. Cinna succeeded him in\r\nthe consulship and Rome was under the government of a detested tyrant. For\r\nfour years his reign was absolute, and was a reign of terror, during which\r\nthe senators were struck down, as the French nobles were in the time of\r\nRobespierre. Cinna, like Robespierre, reigned with the mightiest plenitude\r\nof power, united with incapacity.\r\n\r\nIn this state of anarchy Sulla’s wife and children escaped with\r\ndifficulty, and Sulla himself was deprived of his command against\r\nMithridates. But Cinna, B.C. 84, was killed in a mutiny, and the command\r\nof the revolutionists devolved on Carbo. The situation of Sulla was\r\ncritical, even at the head of his veteran forces. In the spring of the\r\nyear following the death of Cinna, he landed in Brundusium, where he was\r\nre-enforced by partisans and deserters. The Senate made advances to Sulla,\r\nand many patricians joined his ranks, including Cneius Pompeius, then\r\ntwenty-three years of age.\r\n\r\n(M985) Civil war was now inaugurated between Sulla and the revolutionary\r\nparty, at the head of which were now the consul Carbo and the younger\r\nMarius. Carbo was charged with Upper Italy, while Marius guarded Rome at\r\nthe fortress of Præneste. At Sacriportus Sulla defeated Marius, and\r\nentered Rome. But the insurgent Italians united with the revolutionary\r\nforces of Rome, and seventy thousand Samnites and Lucanians approached the\r\ncapital. At the Colline gate a battle was fought, in which Sulla was\r\nvictorious. This ended the Social war, and the subjugation of the\r\nrevolutionists soon followed.\r\n\r\n(M986) Sulla was now made dictator, and the ten years of revolution and\r\ninsurrection were at an end in both West and East. The first use which\r\nSulla made of his absolute power was to outlaw all his enemies. Lists of\r\nthe proscribed were posted at Rome and in the Italian cities. It was a\r\nfearful visitation. A second reign of terror took place, more fearful and\r\nsystematic than that of Marius. Four thousand seven hundred persons were\r\nslaughtered, among whom were forty senators, and one thousand six hundred\r\nequites.\r\n\r\n(M987) The next year Sulla celebrated his magnificent triumph over\r\nMithridates, and was saluted by the name of Felix. The despotism at which\r\nthe Gracchi were accused of aiming was introduced by a military conqueror,\r\naided by the aristocracy.\r\n\r\n(M988) Sulla then devoted himself to the reorganization of the State. He\r\nconferred citizenship upon all the Italians but freedmen, and bestowed the\r\nsequestered estates of those who had taken side against him or his\r\nsoldiers. The office of judices was restored to the Senate, and the\r\nequites were deprived of their separate seats at festivals. The Senate was\r\nrestored to its ancient dignity and power, and three hundred new members\r\nappointed. The number of prætors was increased to eight. The government\r\nstill rested on the basis of popular election, but was made more\r\naristocratic than before. The Comitia Centuriata was left in possession of\r\nthe nominal power of legislation, but it could only be exercised upon the\r\ninitiation of a decree of the Senate. The Comitia Tributa was stripped of\r\nthe powers by which it had so long controlled the Senate and the State.\r\nTribunes of the people were selected from the Senate. The College of\r\nPontiffs was no longer filled by popular election, but by the choice of\r\ntheir own members. A new criminal code was made, and the several courts\r\nwere presided over by the prætors. Such, in substance, were the Cornelian\r\nlaws to restore the old powers of the aristocracy.\r\n\r\n(M989) Having effected this labor, Sulla, in the plenitude of power,\r\nretired into private life. He retired, not like Charles V., wearied of the\r\ntoils of war, and disgusted with the vanity of glory and fame, nor like\r\nWashington, from lofty patriotic motives, but to bury himself in epicurean\r\npleasures. In the luxury of his Cumænon villa he divided his time between\r\nhunting and fishing, and the enjoyments of literature, until, worn out\r\nwith sensuality, he died in his sixtieth year, B.C. 78. A grand procession\r\nof the Senate he had saved, the equites, the magistrates, the vestal\r\nvirgins, and his disbanded soldiers, bore his body to the funeral pyre,\r\nand his ashes were deposited beside the tombs of the kings. A splendid\r\nmonument was raised to his memory, on which was inscribed his own epitaph,\r\nthat no friend ever did him a kindness, and no enemy a wrong, without\r\nreceiving a full requital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nROME FROM THE DEATH OF SULLA TO THE GREAT CIVIL WARS OF CÆSAR AND\r\nPOMPEY.—CICERO, POMPEY, AND CÆSAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the death of Sulla, the Roman government was once more in the hands of\r\nthe aristocracy, and for several years the consuls were elected from the\r\ngreat ruling families. But, in spite of all the conquests of Sulla and all\r\nhis laws, the State was tumbling into anarchy, and was convulsed with\r\nfresh wars.\r\n\r\n(M990) Sulla was alive when M. Lepidus came forward as the leader of the\r\ndemocratic party against C. Lutatius Catulus—a man without character or\r\nability, who had deserted from the optimates to the popular party, to\r\nescape prosecution for the plunder of Sicily. The fortune he acquired in\r\nhis government of that province enabled Lepidus to secure his election as\r\nconsul, B.C. 78, and he even attempted to deprive Sulla of his funeral\r\nhonors. A conspiracy was organized in Etruria, where the Sullan\r\nconfiscation had been most severe. Lepidus came forward as an avenger of\r\nthe old Romans whose fortunes had been ruined. The Senate, fearing\r\nconvulsions, made Lepidus and Catulus, the consuls, swear not to take up\r\narms against each other; but at the expiration of the consulship of\r\nLepidus, went, as was usual, to the province assigned to him. This was\r\nGaul, and here the war first broke out. An attempt on Rome was frustrated\r\nby Catulus, who defeated Lepidus, and the latter soon died in Sardinia,\r\nwhither he had retired.\r\n\r\n(M991) Sertorius was then in command of the army in Spain,—a man who had\r\nrisen from an obscure position, but who possessed the hardy virtues of the\r\nold Sabine farmers. He served under Marius in Gaul, and was prætor when\r\nSulla returned to Italy. When the cause of Marius was lost in Africa, he\r\norganized a resistance to Sulla in Spain. His army was re-enforced by\r\nMarian refugees, and he was aided by the Iberian tribes, among whom he was\r\na favorite. For eight years this celebrated hero baffled the armies which\r\nRome, under the lead of the aristocracy, sent against him, for he\r\nundertook to restore the cause of the democracy.\r\n\r\n(M992) Against Sertorius was sent the man who, next to Cæsar, was destined\r\nto play the most important part in the history of those times—Cn.\r\nPompeius, born the same year as Cicero, B.C. 106, who had enlisted in the\r\ncause of Sulla, and early distinguished himself against the generals of\r\nMarius. He gained great successes in Sicily and Africa, and was, on his\r\nreturn to Rome, saluted by the dictator Sulla himself with the name of\r\n_Magnus_, which title he ever afterward bore. He was then a simple\r\nequestrian, and had not risen to the rank of quæstor, or prætor, or\r\nconsul. Yet he had, at the early age of twenty-four, without enjoying any\r\ncurule office, the honor of a triumph, even against the opposition of\r\nSulla.\r\n\r\n(M993) Pompey was sent to Spain with the title of proconsul, and with an\r\narmy of thirty thousand men. He crossed the Alps between the sources of\r\nthe Rhone and Po, and advanced to the southern coast of Spain. Here he was\r\nmet by Sertorius, and at first was worsted. I need not detail the varied\r\nevents of this war in Spain. The Spaniards at length grew weary of a\r\ncontest which was not to their benefit, but which was carried on in behalf\r\nof rival factions at the capital. Dissensions broke out among the officers\r\nof Sertorius, and he was killed at a banquet by Perpenna, his lieutenant.\r\nOn the death of the only man capable of resisting the aristocracy of Rome,\r\nand whose virtues were worthy of the ancient heroes, the progress of\r\nPompey was easy. Perpenna was taken prisoner and his army was dispersed,\r\nand Spain was reduced to obedience.\r\n\r\n(M994) In the mean time, while Pompey was fighting Sertorius in Spain, a\r\nservile war broke out in Italy, produced in part by the immense demand of\r\nslaves for the gladiatorial shows. One of these slaves, Spartacus, once a\r\nThracian captain of banditti, escaped with seventy comrades to the crater\r\nof Vesuvius, and organized an insurrection, and he was soon at the head of\r\none hundred thousand of those wretched captives whose condition was\r\nunendurable. Italy was ravaged from the Alps to the Straits of Messina. No\r\nRoman general, then in Italy, was equal to the task of subduing them. But,\r\nin the second year of the war, Crassus, who was a great proprietor of\r\nslaves, and who had ably served under Sulla, undertook the task of\r\nsubduing the insurrectionary slaves. With six legions he drove them to the\r\nextremity of the Bruttian peninsula, and shut them up in Rhegium by strong\r\nlines of circumvallation. Spartacus was killed, after having broken\r\nthrough the lines, and most of his followers were destroyed; but six\r\nthousand escaped into Cisalpine Gaul, as the northern part of Italy was\r\nthen called, and met Pompey on his victorious return from Spain, by whom\r\nthey were utterly annihilated. Pompey claimed the merit of ending the\r\nservile war, and sought the honor of the consulship, although ineligible.\r\nCrassus, also ineligible, also demanded the consulship, and both these\r\nlieutenants of Sulla obtained their ends. But both, in order to obtain the\r\nconsulship, made great promises. Pompey, in particular, promised to\r\nrestore the tribunitian power. Pompey now broke with the aristocracy,\r\nwhose champion he had been, and even carried another law by which the\r\njudices were taken from the equites as well as the Senate. Thus was the\r\nconstitution of Sulla subverted within ten years. In this movement Pompey\r\nwas supported by Julius Cæsar, who was a young man of thirty years of age.\r\n\r\n(M995) On the expiration of his consulship, Pompey remained inactive,\r\nrefusing a province, until the troubles with the Mediterranean pirates\r\nagain called him into active military service. These pirates swarmed on\r\nevery coast, plundering cities, and cutting off communication between Rome\r\nand the provinces. They especially attacked the corn vessels, so that the\r\nprice of provisions rose inordinately. The people, in distress, turned\r\ntheir eyes to Pompey; but he was not willing to accept any ordinary\r\ncommand, and through his intrigues, his tool, the tribune Gabinius,\r\nproposed that the people should elect a man for this service of consular\r\nrank, who should have absolute power for three years over the whole of the\r\nMediterranean, and to a distance of fifty miles inward from the coast, and\r\nwho should command a fleet of two hundred ships. He did not name Pompey,\r\nbut everybody knew who was meant. The people, furious at the price of\r\ncorn, and full of admiration for the victories of Pompey, were ready to\r\nappoint him; the Senate, alarmed and jealous, was equally determined to\r\nprevent his appointment. Tumults and riots were the consequence. Pompey\r\naffected to desire some other person for the command but himself; but the\r\nlaw passed, in spite of the opposition of the Senate, and Pompey was\r\ncommissioned to prepare five hundred ships, enlist one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand sailors and soldiers, and also to take from the public treasury\r\nwhatever sum he needed.\r\n\r\nIn the following spring his preparations were made, and in forty days he\r\ncleared the western half of the Mediterranean from the pirates, and drove\r\nthem to the Cilician coast. Here he gained a great victory over their\r\nunited fleets, and took twenty thousand prisoners, whom he settled at\r\nvarious points on the coasts, and returned home in forty-nine days after\r\nhe had sailed from Brundusium. In less than three months he had ended the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n(M996) This great success led to his command against Mithridates, who had\r\nagain rallied his forces for one more decisive and desperate struggle with\r\nthe Romans. Asia rallied against Europe, as Europe rallied against Asia in\r\nthe crusades. Mithridates, after his defeat by Sulla, had retired to\r\nArmenia to the court of his son-in-law, Tigranes, whose power was greater\r\nthan that of any other Oriental potentate. Tigranes was not at first\r\ninclined to break with Rome, but (B.C. 70) he consented to the war, which\r\ncontinued for seven years without decisive results. The Romans were\r\ncommanded by Lucullus, the old lieutenant of Sulla, and although his\r\nlabors were not appreciated at Rome, he broke really the power of\r\nMithridates. But, through the intrigues of Pompey and his friends, he was\r\nrecalled, and Pompey was commissioned, with the extraordinary power of\r\nunlimited control of the Eastern army and fleet, and the rights of\r\nproconsul over the whole of Asia. He already had the dominion of the\r\nMediterranean. The Senate opposed this dangerous precedent, but it was\r\ncarried by the people, who could not heap too many honors on their\r\nfavorite. Cicero, then forty years of age, with Cæsar, supported the\r\nmeasure, which was opposed by Hortensius and Catulus.\r\n\r\n(M997) Lucullus retired to his luxurious villa to squander the riches he\r\nhad accumulated in Asia, and to study the academic philosophy, while\r\nPompey pursued his conquests in the East over foes already broken and\r\nhumiliated. He showed considerable ability, and drove Mithridates from\r\npost to post in the heart of his dominion. The Eastern monarch made\r\novertures of peace, which were rejected. Nothing but unconditional\r\nsurrender would be accepted. His army was finally cut to pieces, and the\r\nold man escaped only with a few horsemen. Rejected by Tigranes, he made\r\nhis way to the Cimmerian Bosphorus, which was his last retreat. Pompey\r\nthen turned his attention to Armenia, and Tigranes threw himself upon his\r\nmercy, at the cost of all his territories but Armenia Proper. Pompey then\r\nresumed the pursuit of Mithridates, fighting his way though the mountains\r\nof Iberia and Albania, but he did not pursue his foe over the Caucasus.\r\nMithridates, secure in the Crimea, then planned a daring attempt on Rome\r\nherself, which was to march round the Euxine and up the Danube, collecting\r\nin his train the Sarmatians, Gætæ, and other barbarians, cross the Alps,\r\nand descend upon Italy. _His_ kingdom of Pontus was already lost, and had\r\nbeen made a Roman province. His followers, however, became disaffected,\r\nhis son Pharnaces rebelled, and he had no other remedy than suicide to\r\nescape capture. He died B.C. 63, after a reign of fifty-three years, in\r\nthe sixty-ninth year of his age—the greatest Eastern prince since Cyrus.\r\nRacine has painted him in one of his dramas as one of the most heroic men\r\nof the world. But it was his misfortune to contend with Rome in the\r\nplenitude of her power.\r\n\r\n(M998) Pompey, before the death of Mithridates, went to Syria to regulate\r\nits affairs, it being ceded to Rome by Tigranes. After the defeat of\r\nTigranes by Lucullus, that kingdom, however, had been recovered by\r\nAntiochus XIII., the last of the Seleucidæ, who held a doubtful\r\nsovereignty. He was, however, reduced by a legate of Pompey, and Syria\r\nbecame a Roman province. The next year, Pompey advanced south, and\r\nestablished the Roman supremacy in Phœnicia and Palestine, the latter\r\ncountry being the seat of civil war between Hyrcanus and Aristobulus. It\r\nwas then that Jerusalem was taken by the Roman general, after a siege of\r\nthree months, and the conqueror entered the most sacred precincts of the\r\ntemple, to the horror of the priesthood. He established Hyrcanus as high\r\npriest, as has been already related, and then retired to Pontus, settled\r\nits affairs, and departed with his army for Italy, having won a succession\r\nof victories never equaled in the East, except by Alexander. And never did\r\nvictories receive such great _éclat_, which, however, were easily won, as\r\nthose of Alexander had been. No Asiatic foe was a match for either Greeks\r\nor Romans in the field. The real difficulties were in marches, in\r\npenetrating mountain passes, in crossing arid plains.\r\n\r\n(M999) But before the conqueror of Asia received the reward of his great\r\nservices to the State—the most splendid triumph which had as yet been seen\r\non the Via Sacra—Rome was brought to the verge of ruin by the conspiracy\r\nof Catiline. The departure of Pompey to punish the pirates of the\r\nMediterranean and conquer Mithridates, left the field clear to the two\r\ngreatest men of their age, Cicero and Cæsar. It was while Cicero was\r\nconsul that the conspiracy was detected.\r\n\r\n(M1000) Marcus Tullius Cicero, the most accomplished man, on the whole, in\r\nRoman annals, and as immortal as Cæsar himself, was born B.C. 106, near\r\nArpinum, of an equestrian, but not senatorial family. He received a good\r\neducation, received the manly gown at sixteen, and entered the forum to\r\nhear the debates, but pursued his studies with great assiduity. He was\r\nintrusted by his wealthy father to the care of the augur, Q. Mucius\r\nScævola, an old lawyer deeply read in the constitution of his country and\r\nthe principles of jurisprudence. At eighteen he served his first and only\r\ncampaign under the father of the great Pompey, in the social war. He was\r\ntwenty-four before he made a figure in the eye of the public, keeping\r\naloof from the fierce struggles of Marius and Sulla, identifying himself\r\nwith neither party, and devoted only to the cultivation of his mind,\r\nstudying philosophy and rhetoric as well as law, traveling over Sicily and\r\nGreece, and preparing himself for a forensic orator. At twenty-five he\r\nappeared in the forum as a public pleader, and boldly defended the\r\noppressed and injured, and even braved the anger of Sulla, then\r\nall-powerful as dictator. At twenty-seven he again repaired to Athens for\r\ngreater culture, and extensively traveled in Asia Minor, holding converse\r\nwith the most eminent scholars and philosophers in the Grecian cities. At\r\ntwenty-nine he returned to Rome, improved in health as well as in those\r\narts which contributed to his unrivaled fame as an orator—a rival with\r\nHortensius and Cotta, the leaders of the Roman bar. At thirty he was\r\nelected quæstor, not, as was usually the case, by family interest, but\r\nfrom his great reputation as a lawyer. The duties of his office called him\r\nto Sicily, under the prætor of Lilybæum, which he admirably discharged,\r\nshowing not only executive ability, but rare virtue and impartiality. The\r\nvanity which dimmed the lustre of his glorious name, and which he never\r\nexorcised, received a severe wound on his return to Italy. He imagined he\r\nwas the observed of all observers, but soon discovered that his gay and\r\nfashionable friends were ignorant, not only of what he had done in Sicily\r\nbut of his administration at all.\r\n\r\n(M1001) For the next four years he was absorbed in private studies, and in\r\nthe courts of law, at the end of which he became ædile, the year that\r\nVerres was impeached for misgovernment in Sicily. This was the most\r\ncelebrated State trial for impeachment on record, with the exception,\r\nperhaps, of that of Warren Hastings. But Cicero, who was the public\r\naccuser and prosecutor, was more fortunate than Burke. He collected such\r\nan overwhelming mass of evidence against this corrupt governor, that he\r\nwent into exile without making a defense, although defended by Hortensius,\r\nconsul elect. The speech which the orator _was to have_ made at the trial\r\nwas subsequently published by Cicero, and is one of the most eloquent\r\ntirades against public corruption ever composed or uttered.\r\n\r\n(M1002) Nothing of especial interest marked the career of this great man\r\nfor three more years, until B.C. 67 he was elected first prætor, or\r\nsupreme judge, an office for which he was supremely qualified. But it was\r\nnot merely civic cases which he decided. He appeared as a political\r\nspeaker, and delivered from the rostrum his celebrated speech on the\r\nManilian laws, maintaining the cause of Pompey when he departed from the\r\npolicy of the aristocracy. He had now gained by pure merit, in a corrupt\r\nage, without family influence, the highest offices of the State, even as\r\nBurke became the leader of the House of Commons without aristocratic\r\nconnections, and now naturally aspired to the consulship,—the great prize\r\nwhich every ambitious man sought, but which, in the aristocratic age of\r\nRoman history, was rarely conferred except on members of the ruling\r\nhouses, or very eminent success in war. By the friendship of Pompey, and\r\nalso from the general admiration which his splendid talents and\r\nattainments commanded, this great prize was also secured. He had six\r\nillustrious competitors, among whom were Antonius and Catiline, who were\r\nassisted by Crassus and Cæsar. As consul, all the energies of his mind and\r\ncharacter were absorbed in baffling the treason of this eminent patrician\r\ndemagogue. L. Sergius Catiline was one of those wicked, unscrupulous,\r\nintriguing, popular, abandoned and intellectual scoundrels that a corrupt\r\nage and patrician misrule brought to the surface of society, aided by the\r\ndegenerate nobles to whose class he belonged. In the bitterness of his\r\npolitical disappointments, headed off by Cicero at every turn, he\r\nmeditated the complete overthrow of the Roman constitution, and his own\r\nelevation as chief of the State, and absolutely inaugurated rebellion.\r\nCicero, who was in danger of assassination, boldly laid the conspiracy\r\nbefore the Senate, and secured the arrest of many of his chief\r\nconfederates. Catiline fled and assembled his followers, which numbered\r\ntwelve thousand desperate men, and fought with the courage of despair, but\r\nwas defeated and slain.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the vigilance, energy, and patriotism of Cicero, it is\r\npossible this atrocious conspiracy would have succeeded. The state of\r\nsociety was completely demoralized; the disbanded soldiers of the Eastern\r\nwars had spent their money and wanted spoils; the Senate was timid and\r\ninefficient, and an unscrupulous and able leader, at the head of\r\ndiscontented factions, on the assassination of the consuls and the\r\nvirtuous men who remained in power, might have bid defiance to any force\r\nwhich could then, in the absence of Pompey in the East, have been\r\nmarshaled against him.\r\n\r\n(M1003) But the State was saved, and saved by a patriotic statesman who\r\nhad arisen by force of genius and character to the supreme power. The\r\ngratitude of the people was unbounded. Men of all ranks hailed him as the\r\nsavior of his country; thanksgivings to the gods were voted in his name,\r\nand all Italy joined in enthusiastic praises.\r\n\r\n(M1004) But he had now reached the culminating height of his political\r\ngreatness, and his subsequent career was one of sorrow and disappointment.\r\nIntoxicated by his elevation,—for it was unprecedented at Rome, in his\r\nday, for a man to rise so high by mere force of eloquence and learning,\r\nwithout fortune, or family, or military exploits,—he became conceited and\r\nvain. In the civil troubles which succeeded the return of Pompey, he was\r\nbanished from the country he had saved, and there is nothing more pitiful\r\nthan his lamentations and miseries while in exile. His fall was natural.\r\nHe had opposed the demoralising current which swept every thing before it.\r\nWhen his office of consul was ended, he was exposed to the hatred of the\r\nsenators whom he had humiliated, of the equites whose unreasonable demands\r\nhe had opposed, of the people whom he disdained to flatter, and of the\r\ntriumvirs whose usurpation he detested. No one was powerful enough to\r\nscreen him from these combined hostilities, except the very men who aimed\r\nat the subversion of Roman liberties, and who wished him out of the way;\r\nhis friend Pompey showed a mean, pusillanimous, and calculating\r\nselfishness, and neither Crassus nor Cæsar liked him. But in his latter\r\ndays, part of which were passed in exile, and all without political\r\nconsideration, he found time to compose those eloquent treatises on almost\r\nevery subject, for which his memory will be held in reverence. Unlike\r\nBacon, he committed no crime against the laws; yet, like him, fell from\r\nhis high estate in the convulsions of a revolutionary age, and as Bacon\r\nsoothed his declining years with the charms of literature and philosophy,\r\nso did Cicero display in his writings the result of long years of study,\r\nand unfold for remotest generations the treasures of Greek and Roman\r\nwisdom, ornamented, too, by that exquisite style, which, of itself, would\r\nhave given him immortality as one of the great artists of the world. He\r\nlived to see the utter wreck of Roman liberties, and was ultimately\r\nexecuted by order of Antonius, in revenge for those bitter philippics\r\nwhich the orator had launched against him before the descending sun of his\r\npolitical glory had finally disappeared in the gloom and darkness of\r\nrevolutionary miseries.\r\n\r\n(M1005) But we resume the thread of political history in those tangled\r\ntimes. Cicero was at the highest of his fame and power when Pompey\r\nreturned from his Asiatic conquests, the great hero of his age, on whom\r\nall eyes were fixed, and to whom all bent the knee of homage and\r\nadmiration. His triumph, at the age of forty-five, was the grandest ever\r\nseen. It lasted two days. Three hundred and twenty-four captive princes\r\nwalked before his triumphal car, followed by spoils and emblems of a war\r\nwhich saw the reduction of one thousand fortresses. The enormous sum of\r\ntwenty thousand talents was added to the public treasury.\r\n\r\n(M1006) Pompey was, however, greater in war than in peace. Had he known\r\nhow to make use of his prestige and his advantages, he might have\r\nhenceforth reigned without a rival. He was not sufficiently noble and\r\ngenerous to live without making grave mistakes and alienating some of his\r\ngreatest friends, nor was he sufficiently bad and unscrupulous to abuse\r\nhis military supremacy. He pursued a middle course, envious of all talent,\r\nabsorbed in his own greatness, vain, pompous, and vacillating. His\r\nquarrels with Crassus and Lucullus severed him from the aristocratic\r\nparty, whose leader he properly was. His haughtiness and coldness\r\nalienated the affections of the people, through whom he could only advance\r\nto supreme dominion. He had neither the arts of a demagogue, nor the\r\nmagnanimity of a conqueror.\r\n\r\n(M1007) It was at this crisis that Cæsar returned from Spain as the\r\nconqueror of the Lusitanians. Caius Julius Cæsar belonged to the ancient\r\npatrician family of the Julii, and was born B.C. 100, and was six years\r\nyounger than Pompey and Cicero. But he was closely connected with the\r\npopular party by the marriage of his aunt Julia with the great Marius, and\r\nhis marriage with Cornelia, the daughter of Cinna, one of the chief\r\nopponents of Sulla. He early served in the army of the East, but devoted\r\nhis earliest years to the art of oratory. His affable manners and\r\nunbounded liberality made him popular with the people. He obtained the\r\nquæstorship at thirty-two, the year he lost his wife, and went as quæstor\r\nto Antistius Vetus, into the province of Further Spain. On his return, the\r\nfollowing year, he married Pompeia, the granddaughter of Sulla, of the\r\nCornelia gens, and formed a union with Pompey. By his family connections\r\nhe obtained the curule ædileship at the age of thirty-five, and surpassed\r\nhis predecessors in the extravagance of his shows and entertainments, the\r\nmoney for which he borrowed. At thirty-seven he was elected Pontifex\r\nMaximus, so great was his popularity, and the following year he obtained\r\nthe prætorship, B.C. 62, and on the expiration of his office he obtained\r\nthe province of Further Spain. His debts were so enormous that he applied\r\nfor aid to Crassus, the richest man in Rome, and readily obtained the loan\r\nhe sought. In Spain, with an army at his command, he gained brilliant\r\nvictories over the Lusitanians, and returned to Rome enriched, and sought\r\nthe consulship. To obtain this, he relinquished the customary triumph,\r\nand, with the aid of Pompey, secured his election, and entered into that\r\nclose alliance with Pompey and Crassus which historians call the first\r\ntriumvirate. It was merely a private agreement between the three most\r\npowerful men of Rome to support each other, and not a distinct magistracy.\r\n\r\n(M1008) As consul, Cæsar threw his influence against the aristocracy, to\r\nwhose ranks he belonged, both by birth and office, and caused an agrarian\r\nlaw to be passed, against the fiercest opposition of the Senate, by which\r\nthe rich Campanian lands were divided for the benefit of the poorest\r\ncitizens—a good measure, perhaps, but which brought him forward as the\r\nchampion of the people. He next gained over the equites, by relieving\r\nthem, by a law which he caused to be passed, of one-third of the sum they\r\nhad agreed to pay for the farming of the taxes of Asia. He secured the\r\nfavor of Pompey by causing all his acts in the East to be confirmed. At\r\nthe expiration of his consulship he obtained the province of Gaul, as the\r\nfullest field for the development of his military talents, and the surest\r\nway to climb to subsequent greatness. At this period Cicero went into\r\nexile without waiting for his trial—that miserable period made memorable\r\nfor aristocratic broils and intrigues, and when Clodius, a reckless young\r\nnoble, entered into the house of the Pontifex Maximus, disguised as a\r\nwoman, in pursuit of a vile intrigue with Cæsar’s wife.\r\n\r\n(M1009) The succeeding nine years of Cæsar’s life were occupied by the\r\nsubjugation of Gaul. In the first campaign he subdued the Helvetii, and\r\nconquered Ariovistus, a powerful German chieftain. In the second campaign\r\nhe opposed a confederation of Belgic tribes—the most warlike of all the\r\nGauls, who had collected a force of three hundred thousand men, and\r\nsignally defeated them, for which victories the Senate decreed a public\r\nthanksgiving of fifteen days. That given in Pompey’s honor, after the\r\nMithridatic war, had lasted but ten. At this time he made a renewed\r\ncompact with Pompey and Crassus, by which Pompey was to have the two\r\nSpains for his province, Crassus that of Syria, and he himself should have\r\na prolonged government in Gaul for five years more. The combined influence\r\nof these men was enough to secure the elections, and the year following\r\nCrassus and Pompey were made consuls. Cæsar had to resist powerful\r\nconfederations of the Gauls, and in order to strike terror among them, in\r\nthe fourth year of the war, invaded Britain. But I can not describe the\r\nvarious campaigns of Cæsar in Gaul and Britain without going into details\r\nhard to be understood—his brilliant victories over enemies of vastly\r\ngreater numbers, his marchings and countermarchings, his difficulties and\r\ndangers, his inventive genius, his strategic talents, his boundless\r\nresources, his command over his soldiers and their idolatry, until, after\r\nnine years, Gaul was subdued and added to the Roman provinces. During his\r\nlong absence from Rome his interests were guarded by the tribune Curio,\r\nand Marcus Antonius, the future triumvir. During this time Crassus had\r\ningloriously conducted a distant war in Parthia, in quest of fame and\r\nriches, and was killed by an unknown hand after a disgraceful defeat. This\r\navaricious patrician must not be confounded with the celebrated orator, of\r\na preceding age, who was so celebrated for his elegance and luxury.\r\n\r\nAffairs at Rome had also taken a turn which indicated a rupture with Cæsar\r\nand Pompey, now left, by the death of Crassus, at the head of the State.\r\nThe brilliant victories of the former in Gaul were in everybody’s mouth,\r\nand the fame of the latter was being eclipsed. A serious rivalry between\r\nthese great generals began to show itself. The disturbances which also\r\nbroke out on the death of Clodius led to the appointment of Pompey as sole\r\nconsul, and all his acts as consul tended to consolidate his power. His\r\ngovernment in Spain was prolonged for five years more; he entered into\r\ncloser connections with the aristocracy, and prepared for a rupture with\r\nhis great rival, which had now become inevitable, as both grasped supreme\r\npower. That struggle is now to be presented in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WARS BETWEEN CÆSAR AND POMPEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M1010) The condition of Rome when Cæsar returned, crowned with glory,\r\nfrom his Gallic campaign, in which he had displayed the most consummate\r\nability, was miserable enough. The constitution had been assailed by all\r\nthe leading chieftains, and even Cicero could only give vent to his\r\ndespair and indignation in impotent lamentations. The cause of liberty was\r\nalready lost. Cæsar had obtained the province of Gaul for ten years,\r\nagainst all former precedent, and Pompey had obtained the extension of his\r\nimperium for five additional years. Both these generals thus had armies\r\nand an independent command for a period which might be called\r\nindefinite—that is, as long as they could maintain their authority in a\r\nperiod of anarchy. Rome was disgraced by tumults and assassinations;\r\nworthless people secured the highest offices, and were the tools of the\r\ntwo great generals, who divided between them the empire of the world. All\r\nfamily ties between these two generals were destroyed by the death of\r\nJulia. The feud between Clodius and Milo, the one a candidate for the\r\nprætorship, and the other for the consulship, was most disgraceful, in the\r\ncourse of which Clodius was slain. Each wanted an office as the means of\r\ndefraying enormous debts. Pompey, called upon by the Senate to relieve the\r\nState from anarchy, was made sole consul—another unprecedented thing. The\r\ntrial of Milo showed that Pompey was the absolute master at Rome, and it\r\nwas his study to maintain his position against Cæsar.\r\n\r\n(M1011) It was plain that the world could not have two absolute masters,\r\nfor both Pompey and Cæsar aspired to universal sovereignty. One must\r\nsuccumb to the other—be either anvil or hammer. Neither would have been\r\nsafe without their unities and their armed followers. And if both were\r\ndestroyed, the State would still be convulsed with factions. All true\r\nconstitutional liberty was at an end, for both generals and demagogues\r\ncould get such laws passed as they pleased, with sufficient money to bribe\r\nthose who controlled the elections. It was a time of universal corruption\r\nand venality. Money was the mainspring of society. Public virtue had\r\npassed away,—all elevated sentiment,—all patriotism,—all self-sacrifice.\r\nThe people cared but little who ruled, if they were supplied with corn and\r\nwine at nominal prices. Patrician nobles had become demagogues, and\r\ndemagogues had power in proportion to their ability or inclination to\r\nplease the people. Cicero despaired of the State, and devoted himself to\r\nliterature. There yet remained the aristocratic party, which had wealth\r\nand prestige and power, and the popular party, which aimed to take these\r\nprivileges away, but which was ruled by demagogues more unprincipled than\r\nthe old nobility. Pompey represented the one, and Cæsar the other, though\r\nboth were nobles.\r\n\r\nBoth these generals had rendered great services. Pompey had subdued the\r\nEast, and Cæsar the West. Pompey had more prestige, Cæsar more genius.\r\nPompey was a greater tactician, Cæsar a greater strategist. Pompey was\r\nproud, pompous, jealous, patronizing, self-sufficient, disdainful. Cæsar\r\nwas politic, intriguing, patient, lavish, unenvious, easily approached,\r\nforgiving, with great urbanity and most genial manners. Both were\r\nambitious, unscrupulous, and selfish. Cicero distrusted both, flattered\r\neach by turns, but inclined to the side of Pompey as more conservative,\r\nand less dangerous. The Senate took the side of Pompey, the people that of\r\nCæsar. Both Cæsar and Pompey had enjoyed power so long, that neither would\r\nhave been contented with private life.\r\n\r\n(M1012) In the year B.C. 49, Cæsar’s proconsular imperium was to terminate\r\none year after the close of the Gallic war. He wished to be re-elected\r\nconsul, and also secure his triumph. But he could not, according to law,\r\nhave the triumph without disbanding the army, and without an army he would\r\nnot be safe at Rome, with so many enemies. Neither could he be elected\r\nconsul, according to the forms, while he enjoyed his imperium, for it had\r\nlong been the custom that no one could sue for the consulship at the head\r\nof an army. He, therefore, could neither be consul nor enjoy a triumph,\r\nlegitimately, without disbanding his army. Moreover, the party of Pompey,\r\nbeing then in the ascendant at Rome, demanded that Cæsar should lay down\r\nhis imperium. The tribunes, in the interests of Cæsar, opposed the decree\r\nof the Senate; the reigning consuls threatened the tribunes, and they fled\r\nto Cæsar’s camp in Cisalpine Gaul. It should, however, be mentioned, that\r\nwhen the consul Marcellus, an enemy of Cæsar, proposed in the Senate that\r\nhe should lay down his command, Curio, the tribune, whose debts Cæsar had\r\npaid, moved that Pompey should do the same; which he refused to do, since\r\nthe election of Cæsar to the consulship would place the whole power of the\r\nrepublic in his hands. Cæsar made a last effort to avoid the inevitable\r\nwar, by proposing to the Senate to lay down his command, if Pompey would\r\nalso; but Pompey prevaricated, and the compromise came to nothing. Both\r\ngenerals distrusted each other, and both were disloyal to the State. The\r\nSenate then appointed a successor to Cæsar in Gaul, ordered a general levy\r\nof troops throughout Italy, and voted money and men to Pompey. Cæsar had\r\nalready crossed the Rubicon, which was high treason, before his last\r\nproposal to compromise, and he was on his way to Rome. No one resisted\r\nhim, for the people had but little interest in the success of either\r\nparty. Pompey, exaggerating his popularity, thought he had only to stamp\r\nthe ground, and an army would appear, and when he discovered that his\r\nrival was advancing on the Flaminican way, fled hastily from Rome with\r\nmost of the senators, and went to Brundusium. Cæsar did not at once seize\r\nthe capital, but followed Pompey, and so vigorously attacked him, that he\r\nquit the town and crossed over to Illyricum. Cæsar had no troops to pursue\r\nhim, and therefore retraced his steps, and entered Rome, after an absence\r\nof ten years, at the head of a victorious army, undisputed master of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n(M1013) But Pompey still controlled his proconsular province of Spain,\r\nwhere seven legions were under his lieutenants, and Africa also was\r\noccupied by his party. Cæsar, after arranging the affairs of Italy,\r\nmarched through Gaul into Spain to fight the generals of Pompey. That\r\ncampaign was ended in forty days, and he became master of Spain. While in\r\nSpain he was elected to his second consulship, and also made dictator. He\r\nreturned to Rome as rapidly as he had marched into Spain, and enacted some\r\nwholesome laws, among others that by which the inhabitants of Cisalpine\r\nGaul, the northern part of Italy, obtained citizenship. After settling the\r\ngeneral affairs of Italy, he laid down the dictatorship, and went, to\r\nBrundusium, and collected his forces from various parts for a decisive\r\nconflict with Pompey, who had remained, meanwhile, in Macedonia,\r\norganizing his army. He collected nine legions, with auxiliary forces,\r\nwhile his fleet commanded the sea. He also secured vast magazines of corn\r\nin Thessaly, Asia, Egypt, Crete, and Cyrene.\r\n\r\n(M1014) Cæsar was able to cross the sea with scarcely more than fifteen\r\nthousand men, on account of the insufficiency of his fleet, and he was\r\nthrown upon a hostile shore, cut off from supplies, and in presence of a\r\nvastly superior force. But his troops were veterans, and his cause was\r\nstrengthened by the capture of Apollonia. He then advanced north to seize\r\nDyrhachiuim, where Pompey’s stores were deposited, but Pompey reached the\r\ntown before him, and both armies encamped on the banks of the river Apsus,\r\nthe one on the left and the other on the right bank. There Cæsar was\r\njoined by the remainder of his troops, brought over with great difficulty\r\nfrom Brundusium by Marcus Antonius, his most able lieutenant and devoted\r\nfriend. Pompey was also re-enforced by two legions from Syria, led by his\r\nfather-in-law, Scipio. Both parties abstained from attacking each other\r\nwhile these re-enforcements were being brought forward, and Cæsar even\r\nmade a last effort at compromise, while the troops on each side exchanged\r\nmutual courtesies.\r\n\r\n(M1015) Pompey avoided a pitched battle, and intrenched himself on a hill\r\nnear Dyrhachium. Cæsar surrounded him with lines of circumvallation.\r\nPompey broke through them, and compelled Cæsar to retire, with\r\nconsiderable loss. He retreated to Thessaly, followed by Pompey, who, had\r\nhe known how to pursue his advantage, might, after this last success—the\r\nlast he ever had—have defeated Cæsar. He had wisely avoided a pitched\r\nbattle until his troops should become inured to service, or until he\r\nshould wear out his adversary; but now, puffed up with victory and\r\nself-confidence, and unduly influenced by his officers, he concluded to\r\nrisk a battle. Cæsar was encamped on the plain of Pharsalia, and Pompey on\r\na hill about four miles distant. The steep bank of the river Enipeus\r\ncovered the right of Pompey’s line and the left of Cæsar’s. The infantry\r\nof the former numbered forty-five thousand; that of the latter, twenty-two\r\nthousand, but they were veterans. Pompey was also superior in cavalry,\r\nhaving seven thousand, while Cæsar had only one thousand. With these,\r\nwhich formed the strength of Pompey’s force, he proposed to outflank the\r\nright of Cæsar, extended on the plain. To guard against this movement,\r\nCæsar withdrew six cohorts from his third line, and formed them into a\r\nfourth in the rear of his cavalry on the right. The battle commenced by a\r\nfurious assault on the lines of Pompey by Cæsar’s veterans, who were\r\nreceived with courage. Meanwhile Pompey’s cavalry swept away that of\r\nCæsar, and was advancing to attack the rear, when they received,\r\nunexpectedly, the charge of the cohorts which Cæsar had posted there, The\r\ncavalry broke, and fled to the mountains. The six cohorts then turned upon\r\nthe slingers and archers, who had covered the attack of the cavalry,\r\ndefeated them, and fell upon the rear of Pompey’s left. Cæsar then brought\r\nup his third line, and decided the battle. Pompey had fled when he saw the\r\ndefeat of his cavalry. His camp was taken and sacked, and his troops, so\r\nconfident of victory, were scattered, surrounded, and taken prisoners.\r\nCæsar, with his usual clemency, spared their lives, nor had he any object\r\nto destroy them. Among those who surrendered after this decisive battle\r\nwas Junius Brutus, who was not only pardoned, but admitted to the closest\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n(M1016) Pompey, on his defeat, fled to Larissa, embarked with his\r\ngenerals, and sailed to Mitylene. As he had still the province of Africa\r\nand a large fleet, it was his policy to go there; but he had a silly\r\nnotion that his true field of glory was the East, and he saw no place of\r\nrefuge but Egypt. That kingdom was then governed by the children of\r\nPtolemy Auletes, Cleopatra and Ptolemy, neither of whom were adults, and\r\nwho, moreover, were quarreling with each other for the undivided\r\nsovereignty of Egypt. At this juncture, Pompey appeared on the coast, on\r\nwhich Ptolemy was encamped. He sent a messenger to the king, with the\r\nrequest that he might be sheltered in Alexandria. To grant it would\r\ncompromise Ptolemy with Cæsar; to refuse it would send Pompey to the camp\r\nof Cleopatra in Syria. He was invited to a conference, and his minister\r\nAchillus was sent out in a boat to bring him on shore. Pompey, infatuated,\r\nimprudently trusted himself in the boat, in which he recognized an old\r\ncomrade, Septimius, who, however, did not return his salutation. On\r\nlanding, he was stabbed by Septimius, who had persuaded Ptolemy to take\r\nhis life, in order to propitiate Cæsar and gain the Egyptian crown. Thus\r\ningloriously fell the conqueror of Asia, and the second man in the empire,\r\nby treachery.\r\n\r\n(M1017) On the flight of Pompey from the fatal battle-field, Cæsar pressed\r\nin pursuit, with only one legion and a troop of cavalry. Fearing a new war\r\nin Asia, Cæsar waited to collect his forces, and then embarked for Egypt.\r\nHe arrived at Alexandria only a few days after the murder of his rival,\r\nand was met by an officer bearing his head. He ordered it to be burned\r\nwith costly spices, and placed the ashes in a shrine, dedicated to\r\nNemesis. He then demanded ten million drachmas, promised by the late king,\r\nand summoned the contending sovereigns to his camp. Cleopatra captivated\r\nhim, and he decided that both should share the throne, but that the\r\nministers of Ptolemy should be deposed, which was reducing the king to a\r\ncipher. But the fanaticism of the Alexandrians being excited, and a\r\ncollision having taken place between them and his troops, Cæsar burned the\r\nEgyptian fleet, and fortified himself at Pharos, awaiting re-enforcements.\r\nPtolemy, however, turned against him, when he had obtained his release,\r\nand perished in an action on the banks of the Nile. Cleopatra was restored\r\nto the throne, under the protection of Rome.\r\n\r\n(M1018) Pharnaces, son of Mithridates, rewarded by Pompey with the throne\r\nof the Bosphorus for the desertion of his father, now made war against\r\nRome. Galvinus, sent against him, sustained a defeat, and Cæsar rapidly\r\nmarched to Asia to restore affairs. It was then he wrote to the Senate\r\nthat brief, but vaunting letter: “_Veni, vidi, vici._” He already\r\nmeditated those conquests in the East which had inflamed the ambition of\r\nhis rival. He caught the spirit of Oriental despotism. He was not proof\r\nagainst the flatteries of the Asiatics. But his love for Cleopatra worked\r\na still greater change in his character, even as it undermined the respect\r\nof his countrymen. History brands with infamy that unfortunate connection,\r\nwhich led to ostentation, arrogance, harshness, impatience, and contempt\r\nof mankind—the same qualities which characterized Napoleon on his return\r\nfrom Egypt.\r\n\r\n(M1019) In September, B.C. 47, Cæsar returned to Italy, having been\r\nalready named dictator by a defeated and obsequious Senate. Cicero was\r\namong the first to meet him, and was graciously pardoned. The only severe\r\nmeasure which he would allow was the confiscation of the property of\r\nPompey and his sons, whose statues, however, he replaced. He now ruled\r\nabsolutely, but under the old forms, and was made tribune for life. The\r\nSenate nominated him consul for five years, and he was also named\r\ndictator.\r\n\r\n(M1020) The only foes who now seriously stood out against him were the\r\nadherents of Pompey, who had time, during his absence in the East, to\r\nreorganize their forces, and it was in Africa that the last conflict was\r\nto be fought. The Pompeians were commanded by Scipio, who fixed his\r\nhead-quarters at Hadrumentum, with an army of ten legions, a large force\r\nof Numidian cavalry, and one hundred and twenty elephants. But Cæsar\r\ndefeated this large army with a vastly inferior force, and the rout was\r\ncomplete. Scipio took ship for Spain, but was driven back, as Marius had\r\nbeen on the Italian coasts when pursued by the generals of Sulla, and\r\nended his life by suicide. Cato, the noblest Roman of his day, whose march\r\nacross the African desert was one of the great feats of his age, might\r\nhave escaped, and would probably have been pardoned: but the lofty stoic\r\ncould not endure the sight of the prostration of Roman liberties, and,\r\nfortifying his courage with the _Phædon_ of Plato, also fell upon his\r\nsword. The Roman republic ended with his death.\r\n\r\n(M1021) After reducing Numidia to a Roman province, Cæsar returned to\r\nItaly with immense treasures, and was everywhere received with unexampled\r\nhonors. At Rome he celebrated a fourfold triumph—for victories in Gaul,\r\nEgypt, Africa, and the East—and the Senate decreed that his image in ivory\r\nshould be carried in procession with those of the gods. His bronze statue\r\nwas set upon a globe in the capitol, as the emblem of universal\r\nsovereignty. All the extravagant enthusiasm which marked the French people\r\nfor the victories of Napoleon, and all the servility which unbounded power\r\neverywhere commands, were bestowed upon the greatest conqueror the ancient\r\nworld ever saw. A thanksgiving was decreed for forty days; the number of\r\nthe lictors was doubled; he was made dictator for ten years, with the\r\ncommand of all the armies of the State, and the presidency of the public\r\nfestivals. He also was made censor for three years, by which he regulated\r\nthe Senate according to his sovereign will. His triumphs were followed by\r\nprofuse largesses to the soldiers and people, and he also instituted\r\nmagnificent games under an awning of silk, at the close of which the\r\n_Forum Julium_ was dedicated.\r\n\r\n(M1022) Such were his unparalleled honors and powers. All the great\r\noffices of the State were invested and united in him, and nothing was\r\nwanted to complete his aggrandizement but the name of emperor. But we turn\r\nfrom these, the usual rewards of conquerors, to glance at the services he\r\nrendered to civilization, which constitute his truest claim to\r\nimmortality. One of the greatest was the reform of the calendar, for the\r\nRoman year was ninety days in advance of the true meaning of that word.\r\nThe old year had been determined by lunar months rather than by the\r\napparent path of the sun among the fixed stars which had been determined\r\nby the ancient astronomers, and was one of the greatest discoveries of\r\nancient science. The Roman year consisted of three hundred and fifty-five\r\ndays, so that January was an autumn month. Cæsar inserted the regular\r\nintercalary month of twenty-three days, and two additional ones of\r\nsixty-seven days. These were added to the three hundred and sixty-five\r\ndays, making a year of transition of four hundred and forty-five days, by\r\nwhich January was brought back to the first month of the year, after the\r\nwinter solstice. And to prevent the repetition of the error, he directed\r\nthat in future the year should consist of three hundred and sixty-five\r\ndays and one quarter of a day, which he effected by adding one day to the\r\nmonths of April, June, September, and November, and two days to the months\r\nof January, Sextilis, and December, making an addition of ten days to the\r\nold year of three hundred and fifty-five, and he provided for a uniform\r\nintercalation of one day in every fourth year. Cæsar was a student of\r\nastronomy, and always found time for its contemplation. He even wrote an\r\nessay on the motion of the stars, assisted in his observation by\r\nSosigenes, an Alexandrian astronomer. He took astronomy out of the hands\r\nof priests, and made it a matter of civil legislation. He was drawn away\r\nfrom legislation to draw the sword once more against the relics of the\r\nPompeian party, which had been collected in Spain. On the field of Munda\r\nwas fought his last great battle, contested with unusual fury, and\r\nattended with savage cruelties. Thirty thousand of his opponents fell in\r\nthis battle, and Sextus Pompey alone, of all the marked men, escaped to\r\nthe mountains, and defied pursuit. On this victory he celebrated his last\r\ntriumph, and the supple Senate decreed to him the title of Imperator. He\r\nwas made consul for ten years, dictator for life, his person was decreed\r\ninviolable, and he was surrounded by a guard of nobles and senators. He\r\nalso received the insignia of royalty, a golden chair and a diadem set\r\nwith gems, and was allowed to wear the triumphal robe of purple whenever\r\nhe appeared in public. The coins were stamped with his image, his statue\r\nwas placed in the temples, and his friends obtained all the offices of the\r\nState. He adopted Octavius, his nephew, for his heir, and paved the way\r\nfor an absolute despotism under his successors. The measure of his glory\r\nand ambition was full. He was the undisputed master of the world.\r\n\r\nHe then continued his reforms and improvements, as Napoleon did after his\r\ncoronation as emperor. He gave the Roman franchise to various States and\r\ncities out of Italy, and colonized new cities. He excluded _judices_ from\r\nall ranks but those of senators and knights, and enacted new laws for the\r\nsecurity of persons and property. He gave unbounded religious toleration,\r\nand meditated a complete codification of the Roman law. He founded a\r\nmagnificent public library, appointed commissioners to make a map of the\r\nwhole empire, and contemplated the draining of the Pontine marshes.\r\n\r\n(M1023) After these works of legislation and public improvement, he\r\nprepared for an expedition to Parthia, in which he hoped to surpass the\r\nconquests of Alexander in the East. But his career was suddenly cut off by\r\nhis premature death. The nobles whom he humiliated, and the Oriental\r\ndespotism he contemplated, caused a secret hostility which he did not\r\nsuspect amid the universal subserviency to his will. Above all, the title\r\nof king, the symbol of legitimate sovereignty, to which he aspired,\r\nsharpened the daggers of the few remaining friends of the liberty which\r\nhad passed away for ever. All the old party of the State concocted the\r\nconspiracy, some eighty nobles, at the head of which were Brutus and\r\nCassius. On the fifteenth day of March, B.C. 44, the Ides of March, the\r\nday for which the Senate was convened for his final departure for the\r\nEast, he was stabbed in the senate-house, and he fell, pierced with\r\nwounds, at the foot of Pompey’s statue, in his fifty-sixth year, and\r\nanarchy, and new wars again commenced.\r\n\r\n(M1024) The concurrent voices of all historians and critics unite to give\r\nCæsar the most august name of all antiquity. He was great in every\r\nthing,—as orator, as historian, as statesman, as general, and as lawgiver.\r\nHe had genius, understanding, memory, taste, industry, and energy. He\r\ncould write, read, and dictate at the same time. He united the bravery of\r\nAlexander with the military resources of Hannibal. He had a marvelous\r\nfaculty of winning both friends and enemies. He was generous, magnanimous,\r\nand courteous. Not even his love for Cleopatra impaired the energies of\r\nhis mind and body. He was not cruel or sanguinary, except when urged by\r\nreasons of State. He pardoned Cicero, and received Brutus into intimate\r\nfriendship. His successes were transcendent, and his fortune never failed\r\nhim. He reached the utmost limit of human ambition, and was only hurled\r\nfrom his pedestal of power by the secret daggers of fanatics, who saw in\r\nhis elevation the utter extinction of Roman liberty. But liberty had\r\nalready fled, and a degenerate age could only be ruled by a despot. It\r\nmight have been better for Rome had his life been prolonged when all\r\nconstitutional freedom had become impossible. But he took the sword, and\r\nNemesis demanded that he should perish by it, as a warning to all future\r\nusurpers who would accomplish even good ends by infamous means. Vulgar\r\npity compassionates the sad fate of the great Julius; but we can not\r\nforget that it was he who gave the last blow to the constitution and\r\nliberties of his country. The greatness of his gifts and services pale\r\nbefore the gigantic crime of which he stands accused at the bar of all the\r\nages, and the understanding of the world is mocked when his usurpation is\r\njustified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WARS FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF CÆSAR.—ANTONIUS.—AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assassination of Cæsar was not immediately followed with the\r\nconvulsions which we should naturally expect. The people were weary of\r\nwar, and sighed for repose, and, moreover, were comparatively indifferent\r\non whom the government fell, since their liberties were hopelessly\r\nprostrated. Only one thing was certain, that power would be usurped by\r\nsome one, and most probably by the great chieftains who represented\r\nCæsar’s interests.\r\n\r\n(M1025) The most powerful men in Rome at this time, were Marcus Antonius,\r\nthe most able of Cæsar’s lieutenants, the most constant of his friends,\r\nand the nearest of his relatives, although a man utterly unprincipled;\r\nOctavius, grandson of Julius, whom Cæsar adopted as his heir, a young man\r\nof nineteen; Lepidus, colleague consul with Cæsar, the head of the ancient\r\nfamily of the Lepidi, thirteen of whom had been honored with curule\r\nmagistracies; Sextus Pompeius, son of Pompey; Brutus and Cassius, chief\r\nconspirators; Dolabella, a man of consular rank, and one of the profligate\r\nnobles of his time; Hirtia and Pansa, consuls; Piso, father-in-law of\r\nCæsar, of a powerful family, which boasted of several consuls; and\r\nCicero—still influential from his great weight of character. All these men\r\nwere great nobles, and had filled the highest offices.\r\n\r\n(M1026) The man who, to all appearance, had the fairest chance for supreme\r\ncommand in those troubled times, was Antony, whose mother was Julia,\r\nCæsar’s sister. He was grandson to the great orator M. Antonius, who\r\nflourished during the civil wars between Marius and Sulla, and was\r\ndistinguished for every vice, folly, and extravagance which characterized\r\nthe Roman nobles. But he was a man of consummate ability as a general, was\r\nmaster of the horse, and was consul with Cæsar, when he was killed, B.C.\r\n44. He was also eloquent, and pronounced the funeral oration of the\r\nmurdered Imperator, as nearest of kin. He had possession of Cæsar’s\r\npapers, and was the governor of Cisalpine Gaul. He formed a union with\r\nLepidus, to whom he offered the office of Pontifex Maximus, the second\r\noffice in the State. As consul, he could unlock the public treasury, which\r\nhe rifled to the extent of seven hundred million of sesterces—the vast sum\r\nleft by Cæsar. One of his brothers was prætor, and another, a tribune. He\r\nconvened the Senate, and employed, by the treasure he had at command, the\r\npeople to overawe the Senate, as the Jacobin clubs of the French\r\nrevolution overawed the Assembly. He urged the Senate to ratify Cæsar’s\r\nacts and confirm his appointments, and in this was supported by Cicero and\r\na majority of the members. Now that the deed was done, he wished to have\r\nthe past forgotten. This act of amnesty confirmed his fearful\r\npre-eminence, and the inheritance of the mighty dead seemingly devolved\r\nupon him. The conspirators came to terms with him, and were even\r\nentertained by him, and received the provinces which he assigned to them.\r\nBrutus received Macedonia; Cassius, Syria; Trebonius, Asia; Cimber,\r\nBythinia; and Decimus, Cisalpine Gaul. Dolabella was his colleague in the\r\nconsulship,—a personal enemy, yet committed to his policy.\r\n\r\nCæsar had left three hundred sesterces to every citizen, (about £3,) and\r\nhis gardens beyond the Tiber to the use of the people. Such gifts operated\r\nin producing an intense gratitude for the memory of a man who had proved\r\nso great a benefactor, and his public funeral was of unprecedented\r\nsplendor. Antony, as his nearest heir, and the first magistrate,\r\npronounced the oration, which was a consummate piece of dramatic art, in\r\nwhich he inflamed the passions of the people, and stimulated them to\r\nfrenzy, so that they turned upon the assassins with fury. But he assured\r\nthe Senate of his moderation, abolished the dictatorship forever, and\r\nsecured his own personal safety by a body-guard.\r\n\r\n(M1027) He had, however, a powerful rival in the young Octavius, who had\r\nbeen declared by Cæsar’s will his principal heir, then absent in\r\nApollonia. He resolved to return at once and claim his inheritance, and\r\nwas warmly received at Brundusium by the veteran troops, and especially by\r\nCicero, who saw in him a rival to Antony. Octavius flattered the old\r\norator, and ingratiated himself in the favor of everybody by his\r\nunassuming manners, and his specious language. He entered Rome under\r\nfavorable omens, paid his court to the senators, and promised to fulfill\r\nhis uncle’s requests. He was received by Antony in the gardens of\r\nPompeius, and claimed at once his inheritance. Antony replied that it was\r\nnot private property but the public treasure, and was, moreover, spent.\r\nOctavius was not to be put off, and boldly declared that he would and\r\ncould pay the legacies, and contrived to borrow the money. Such an act\r\nsecured unrivaled popularity. He gave magnificent shows, and then claimed\r\nthat the jeweled crown of Cæsar should be exhibited on the festival which\r\nhe instituted to Venus, and to whose honor Cæsar had vowed to build a\r\ntemple, on the morning of his victory at Pharsalia. The tribunes,\r\ninstigated by Antonius, refused to sanction this mark of honor, but\r\nfortune favored Octavius, and, in the enthusiasm of the festival, which\r\nlasted eleven days, the month Quintilius was changed to Julius—the first\r\ndemigod whom the Senate had translated to Olympus.\r\n\r\n(M1028) Meanwhile Brutus and Cassius retired from public affairs,\r\nlingering in the neighborhood of Rome, and the provinces promised to them\r\nwere lost. At Antium they had an interview with Cicero, who advised them\r\nto keep quiet, and not venture to the capital, where the people were\r\ninflamed against them. Their only encouragement was the successes of\r\nSextus Pompeius in Spain, who had six legions at his command. Cicero\r\nforesaw that another civil war was at hand, and had the gloomiest\r\nforebodings, for one or the other of the two great chieftains of the\r\npartisans of Cæsar was sure of ultimately obtaining the supreme power. The\r\nhumiliating conviction that the murder of Cæsar was a mistake, was now\r\ndeeply impressed upon his mind, since it would necessarily inaugurate\r\nanother bloody war. Self banished from Rome, this great and true patriot\r\nwandered from place to place to divert his mind. But neither the\r\nfascinations of literature, nor the attractions of Tusculum, Puteoli,\r\nPompeii, and Neapolis, where he had luxurious villas, could soothe his\r\nanxious and troubled soul. Religious, old, and experienced, he could only\r\nponder on the coming and final prostration of that cause of constitutional\r\nliberty to which he was devoted.\r\n\r\n(M1029) Antonius, also aware of the struggle which was impending, sought\r\nto obtain the government of Cisalpine Gaul, and of the six legions\r\ndestined for the Parthian war. But he was baffled by the Senate, and by\r\nthe intrigues of Octavius, who sheltered himself behind the august name of\r\nthe man by whom he had been adopted. He therefore made a hollow\r\nreconciliation with Octavius, and by his means, obtained the Gaulish\r\nprovinces. Cicero, now only desirous to die honorably, returned to Rome to\r\naccept whatever fate was in store for him, and defend to the last his\r\nbroken cause. It was then, in the Senate, that he launched forth those\r\nindignant philippies against Antonius, as a public enemy, which are among\r\nhis greatest efforts, and which most triumphantly attest his moral\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nThe hollow reconciliation between Antonius and Octavius was not of long\r\nduration, and the former, as consul, repaired to Brundusium to assume\r\ncommand of the legions stationed there, and Octavius collected his forces\r\nin Campania. Both parties complained of each other, and both invoked the\r\nname of Cæsar. Cicero detested the one, and was blinded as to the other.\r\n\r\n(M1030) The term of office as consul, which Antonius held, had now\r\nexpired, and Hirtius, one of the new consuls, marched into Cisalpine Gaul,\r\nand Octavius placed himself under his command. The Senate declared a state\r\nof public danger. The philippics of Cicero had taken effect, and the\r\nSenate and the government were now opposed to Antonius, as the creator of\r\na new revolution. The consuls crossed swords with Antonius at Forum\r\nGallorum, and the consul Pansa fell, but success was with the government.\r\nAnother success at Mutina favored the government party, which Octavius had\r\njoined. On the news of this victory, Cicero delivered his fourteenth and\r\nlast philippic against Antonius, who now withdrew from Cisalpine Gaul, and\r\nformed a junction with Lepidus beyond the Alps. Octavius declined to\r\npursue him, and Plancus hesitated to attack him, although joined by\r\nDecimus, one of the murderers of Cæsar, with ten legions. Octavius now\r\nheld aloof from the government army, from which it was obvious that he had\r\nambitious views of his own to further, and was denounced by Plancus to\r\nCicero. The veteran statesman, at last, perceived that Octavius, having\r\ndeserted Decimus (who, of all the generals, was the only one on whose\r\nfidelity the State could securely lean), was not to be further relied\r\nupon, and cast his eyes to Macedonia and Syria, to which provinces Brutus\r\nand Cassius had retired. The Senate, too, now distrusted Octavius, and\r\ntreated him with contumely; but supported by veteran soldiers, he demanded\r\nthe consulship, and even secretly corresponded with Antonius, and assured\r\nhim of his readiness to combine with him and Lepidus, and invited them to\r\nfollow him to Rome. He marched at the head of eight legions, pretending\r\nall the while to be coerced by them. The Senate, overawed, allowed him, at\r\ntwenty years of age, to assume the consulship, with Pedius, grand-nephew\r\nof Cæsar, for his colleague. Since Hirtius and Pansa had both fallen,\r\nOctavius, then leaving the city in the hands of a zealous colleague,\r\nopened negotiations with Antonius and Lepidus, perceiving that it was only\r\nin conjunction with them that his usurpation could be maintained. They met\r\nfor negotiations at Bononia, and agreed to share the empire between them.\r\nThey declared themselves triumvirs for the settlement of the commonwealth,\r\nand after a conference of three days, divided between themselves the\r\nprovinces and legions. They then concerted a general proscription of their\r\nenemies. The number whom they thus doomed to destruction was three hundred\r\nsenators and two thousand knights, from the noblest families of Rome,\r\namong whom were brothers, uncles, and favorite officers. The possession of\r\nriches was fatal to some, and of beautiful villas to others. Cicero was\r\namong this number, as was to be expected, for he had exhausted the Latin\r\nlanguage in vituperations of Antonius, whom he hated beyond all other\r\nmortals, and which hatred was itself a passion. He spoke of Cæsar with\r\nawe, of Pompey with mortification, of Crassus with dislike, and of Antony\r\nwith bitter detestation and unsparing malice. It was impossible that he\r\ncould escape, even had he fled to the ends of the earth. The vacillation\r\nof his last hours, his deep distress, and mournful agonies are painted by\r\nPlutarch. He fell a martyr to the cause of truth, and public virtue, and\r\nexalted patriotism, although his life was sullied by weakness and\r\ninfirmities, such as vanity, ambition, and jealousy. In the dark and\r\nwicked period which he adorned by his transcendent talents and matchless\r\nservices, he lived and died in faith—the most amiable and the most noble\r\nof all his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe triumvirs had now gratified their vengeance by a series of murders\r\nnever surpassed in the worst ages of religious and political fanaticism.\r\nAnd all these horrible crimes were perpetrated in the name of that great\r\nand august character who had won the world by his sword. The prestige of\r\nthat mighty name sanctioned their atrocities and upheld their power. Cæsar\r\nstill lived, although assassinated, and the triumvirs reigned as his heirs\r\nor avengers, even as Louis Napoleon grasped the sceptre of his uncle, not\r\nfrom any services _he_ had rendered, but as the heir of his conquests. The\r\nRomans loved Cæsar as the French loved Napoleon, and submitted to the rule\r\nof the triumvirs, as the French submitted to the usurpations of the\r\nproscribed prisoner of Ham. And in the anarchy which succeeded the\r\nassassination of the greatest man of antiquity, it must need be that the\r\nstrongest would seize the reins, since all liberty and exalted patriotism\r\nhad fled.\r\n\r\n(M1031) But these usurpers did not secure their power without one more\r\nlast struggle of the decimated and ruined aristocracy. They rallied under\r\nthe standards of Brutus and Cassius in Macedonia and Syria. The one was at\r\nthe head of eight legions, and the other of eleven, a still formidable\r\nforce. Sextus Pompeius also still lived, and had intrenched himself in\r\nSicily. A battle had still to be fought before the republic gave its last\r\nsigh. Cicero ought to have joined these forces, and might have done so,\r\nbut for his vacillation. So Lepidus, as consul, took control of Rome and\r\nthe interests of Italy, while Antonius marched against Brutus and Cassius\r\nin the East, and Octavius assailed Sextus in Sicily; unable, however, to\r\nattack him without ships, he joined his confederate. Their united forces\r\nwere concentrated in Philippi, in Thrace, and there was fought the last\r\ndecisive battle between the republicans, if the senatorial and\r\naristocratic party under Brutus and Cassius can be called republicans, and\r\nthe liberators, as they called themselves, or the adherents of Cæsar. The\r\nrepublicans had a force of eighty thousand infantry and twenty thousand\r\ncavalry, while the triumvirs commanded a still superior force. The numbers\r\nengaged in this great conflict exceeded all former experience, and the\r\nbattle of Philippi was the most memorable in Roman annals, since all the\r\navailable forces of the empire were now arrayed against each other. The\r\nquestion at issue was, whether power should remain with the old\r\nconstitutional party, or with the party of usurpation which Cæsar had\r\nheaded and led to victory. It was whether Rome should be governed by the\r\nold forms, or by an imperator with absolute authority. The forces arrayed\r\non that fatal battle-field—the last conflict for liberty ever fought at\r\nRome—were three times as great as fought at Pharsalia. On that memorable\r\nbattle-field the republic perished. The battle was fairly and bravely\r\nfought on both sides, but victory inclined to the Cæsarians, in two\r\ndistinct actions, after an interval of twenty days, B.C. 42. Both Cassius\r\nand Brutus fell on their own swords, and their self-destruction, in utter\r\ndespair of their cause, effectually broke up their party.\r\n\r\n(M1032) The empire was now in the hands of the triumvirs. The last contest\r\nwas decisive. Future struggles were worse than useless. Destiny had\r\nproclaimed the extinction of Roman liberties for ever. It was vice and\r\nfaction which had prepared the way for violence, and the last appeal to\r\nthe sword had settled the fate of the empire, henceforth to be governed by\r\na despot.\r\n\r\nBut there being now three despots among the partisans of Cæsar, who sought\r\nto grasp his sceptre, Which should prevail? Antonius was the greatest\r\ngeneral; Octavius was the greatest man; Lepidus was the tool of both. The\r\nreal rivalry was between Octavius and Antonius. But they did not at once\r\nquarrel. Antonius undertook the subjugation of the eastern provinces, and\r\nOctavius repaired to Rome. The former sought, before the great encounter\r\nwith his rival, to gain military _éclat_ from new victories; the latter to\r\ncontrol factions and parties in the capital. They first got rid of\r\nLepidus, now that their more powerful enemies were subdued, and compelled\r\nhim to surrender the command in Italy and content himself with the\r\ngovernment of Africa. Antonius, commanding no less than twenty-eight\r\nlegions, which, with auxiliaries, numbered one hundred and seventy\r\nthousand, had perhaps the best chance. His exactions were awful; but he\r\nsquandered his treasures, and gave vent to his passions.\r\n\r\n(M1033) The real cause of his overthrow was Cleopatra, for had he not been\r\nled aside by his inordinate passion for this woman, and had he exercised\r\nhis vast power with the wisdom and ability which he had previously shown,\r\nthe most able of all of Cæsar’s generals, he probably would have triumphed\r\nover every foe. On his passage through Cilicia, he was met by Cleopatra,\r\nin all the pomp and luxury of an Oriental sovereign. She came to deprecate\r\nhis wrath, ostensibly, and ascended the Cydnus in a bark with gilded stern\r\nand purple sails, rowed with silver oars, to the sound of pipes and\r\nflutes. She reclined, the most voluptuous of ancient beauties, under a\r\nspangled canopy, attended by Graces and Cupids, while the air was scented\r\nwith the perfumes of Olympus. She soon fascinated the most powerful man in\r\nthe empire, who, forgetting his ambition, resigned himself to love.\r\nOctavius, master of himself, and of Italy, confiscated lands for the\r\nbenefit of the soldiership prepared for future contingencies. Though\r\nAntonius married Octavia, the sister of Octavius, he was full of intrigues\r\nagainst him and Octavius, on his part, proved more than a match in\r\nduplicity and concealed hostilities. They, however, pretended to be\r\nfriends; and the treaty of Brundusium, celebrated by Virgil, would seem to\r\nindicate that the world was now to enjoy the peace it craved. After a\r\ndebauch, Antonius left Rome for the East, and Octavius for Gaul, each with\r\na view of military conquests. Antonius, with his new wife, had seemingly\r\nforgotten Cleopatra, and devoted himself to the duties of the camp with an\r\nassiduity worthy of Cæsar himself. Octavius has a naval conflict with\r\nSextus, and is defeated, but Sextus fails to profit from his victory, and\r\nOctavius, with the help of his able lieutenants, and re-enforced by\r\nAntonius, again attacks Sextus, and is again defeated. In a third conflict\r\nhe is victorious, and Sextus escapes to the East. Lepidus, ousted and\r\ncheated by both Antonius and Octavius, now combines with Sextus and the\r\nPompeians, and makes head against Octavius; but is deserted by his\r\nsoldiers, and falls into the hands of his enemy, who spares his life in\r\ncontempt. He had owed his elevation to his family influence, and not to\r\nhis own abilities. Sextus, at last, was taken and slain.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Octavius was at the head of the Cæsarian party. He had\r\nwon the respect and friendship of the Romans by his clemency and\r\nmunificence. He was not a great general, but he was served by a great\r\ngeneral, Agrippa, and by another minister of equal talents, Mecrenas. He\r\ncontrolled even more forces than Antonius, no less than forty-five legions\r\nof infantry, and twenty-five thousand cavalry, and thirty-seven thousand\r\nlight-armed auxiliaries. Antonius, on the other hand, had forfeited the\r\nesteem of the Romans by his prodigalities, by his Oriental affectations,\r\nand by his slavery to Cleopatra.\r\n\r\nThis artful and accomplished woman again met Antonius in Asia, and resumed\r\nher sway. The general of one hundred battles became effeminated by his\r\nvoluptuous dalliance, so that his Parthian campaign was a failure, even\r\nthough he led an army of one hundred thousand men. He was obliged to\r\nretreat, and his retreat was disastrous. It was while he was planning\r\nanother campaign that Octavia, his wife, and the sister of his rival,—a\r\nwoman who held the most dignified situation in the world,—brought to his\r\ncamp both money and troops, and hoped to allay the jealousies of her\r\nhusband, and secure peace between him and her brother. But Antonius\r\nheartlessly refused to see this noble-minded woman, while he gave\r\nprovinces to Cleopatra. At Alexandria this abandoned profligate plunged,\r\nwith his paramour, into every excess of extravagant debauchery, while she\r\nwho enslaved him only dreamed of empire and domination. She may have loved\r\nhim, but she loved power more than she did debauchery. Her intellectual\r\naccomplishments were equal to her personal fascinations, and while she\r\nbeguiled the sensual Roman with costly banquets, her eye was steadily\r\ndirected to the establishment of her Egyptian throne.\r\n\r\nThe rupture which Octavia sought to prevent between her brother and her\r\nhusband—for, with the rarest magnanimity she still adhered to him in spite\r\nof his infatuated love for Cleopatra—at last took place, when Octavius was\r\ntriumphant over Sextus, and Antonius was unsuccessful in the distant East.\r\nOctavius declared war against the queen of Egypt, and Antonius divorced\r\nOctavia. Throughout the winter of B.C. 31, both parties prepared for the\r\ninevitable conflict, for Rome now could have but one master. The fate of\r\nthe empire was to be settled, not by land forces, but a naval battle, and\r\nthat was fought at Actium, not now with equal forces, for those of\r\nAntonius had been weakened by desertions. Moreover, he rejected the advice\r\nof his ablest generals, and put himself under the guidance of his\r\nmistress, while Octavius listened to the counsels of Agrippa.\r\n\r\nThe battle had scarcely begun before Cleopatra fled, followed by Antonius.\r\nThe destruction of the Antonian fleet was the consequence. This battle,\r\nB.C. 31, gave the empire of the world to Octavius, and Antonius fled to\r\nAlexandria with the woman who had ruined him. And it was well that the\r\nempire fell into the hands of a politic and profound statesman, who sought\r\nto consolidate it and preserve its peace, rather than into those of a\r\ndebauched general, with insatiable passions and blood-thirsty vengeance.\r\nThe victor landed in Egypt, while the lovers abandoned themselves to\r\ndespair. Antonius, on the rumor of Cleopatra’s death, gave himself a\r\nmortal wound, but died in the arms of her for whom he had sacrificed fame,\r\nfortune, and life. Cleopatra, in the interview which Octavius sought at\r\nAlexandria, attempted to fascinate him by those arts by which she had led\r\nastray both Cæsar and Antonius, but the cold and politic conqueror was\r\nunmoved, and coldly demanded the justification of her political career,\r\nand reserved her to grace his future triumph. She eluded his vigilance,\r\nand destroyed herself, as is supposed, by the bite of asps, since her dead\r\nbody showed none of the ordinary spots of poison. She died, B.C. 30, in\r\nthe fortieth year of her age, and was buried as a queen by the side of her\r\nlover. Her son Cæsarion, by Julius Cæsar, was also put to death, and then\r\nthe master of the world “wiped his blood-stained sword, and thrust it into\r\nthe scabbard.” No more victims were needed. No rivalship was henceforth to\r\nbe dreaded, and all opposition to his will had ceased.\r\n\r\nOctavius reduced Egypt to the form of a Roman province, and after\r\nadjusting the affairs of the East, among which was the confirmation of\r\nHerod as sovereign of Judea, he returned to Rome to receive his new\r\nhonors, and secure his undivided sovereignty. Peace was given to the world\r\nat last. The imperator dedicated temples to the gods, and gave games and\r\nspectacles to the people. The riches of all previous conquests were his to\r\ndispose and enjoy—the extent of which may be conjectured from the fact\r\nthat Cæsar alone had seized an amount equal to one hundred and seventy\r\nmillion pounds, not reckoning the relative value to gold in these times.\r\nDivine honors were rendered to Octavius as the heir of Cæsar. He assumed\r\nthe prænomen of imperator, but combined in himself all the great offices\r\nof the republic which had been overturned. As censor, he purged and\r\ncontrolled the Senate, of which he was appointed _princeps_, or chief. As\r\nconsul he had the control of the armies of the State; as perpetual\r\nproconsul over all the provinces of the empire, he controlled their\r\nrevenues, their laws, their internal reforms, and all foreign relations.\r\nAs tribune for life, he initiated legal measures before the Comitia of the\r\ntribes; as Pontifex Maximus, he had the regulation of all religious\r\nceremonials. All these great offices were voted him by a subservient\r\npeople. The only prerogative which remained to them was the making of\r\nlaws, but even this great and supreme power he controlled, by assuming the\r\ninitiation of all laws and measures,—that which Louis Napoleon has claimed\r\nin the Corps Legislatif. He had also resorted to edicts, which had the\r\nforce of laws, and ultimately composed no small part of the Roman\r\njurisprudence. Finally, he assumed the name of Cæsar, as he had of\r\nAugustus, and consummated the reality of despotism by the imposing title\r\nof imperator, or emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN EMPIRE ON THE ACCESSION OF AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOctavius, now master of the world, is generally called Augustus Cæsar—the\r\nname he assumed. He was the first of that great line of potentates whom we\r\ncall emperors. Let us, before tracing the history of the empire, take a\r\nbrief survey of its extent, resources, population, institutions, state of\r\nsociety, and that development of Art, science, and literature, which we\r\ncall civilization, in the period which immediately preceded the birth of\r\nChrist, when the nations were subdued, submissive to the one central\r\npower, and at peace with each other.\r\n\r\n(M1034) The empire was not so large as it subsequently became, nor was it\r\nat that height of power and prosperity which followed a century of peace,\r\nwhen uninterrupted dominion had reconciled the world to the rule of the\r\nCæsars. But it was the golden age of imperial domination, when arts,\r\nscience, and literature flourished, and when the world rested from\r\nincessant wars. It was not an age of highest glory to man, since all\r\nstruggles for liberty had ceased; but it was an age of good government,\r\nwhen its machinery was perfected, and the great mass of mankind felt\r\nsecure, and all classes abandoned themselves to pleasure, or gain, or\r\nuninterrupted toils. It was the first time in the history of the world,\r\nwhen there was only _one_ central authority, and when the experiment was\r\nto be tried, not of liberty and self-government, but of universal empire,\r\ngrowing up from universal rivalries and wars—wielded by one central and\r\nirresistible will. The spectacle of the civilized world obedient to _one_\r\nmaster has sublimity, and moral grandeur, and suggests principles of grave\r\ninterest. The last of the great monarchies which revelation had foretold,\r\nand the greatest of all—the iron monarchy which Daniel saw in prophetic\r\nvision, reveals lessons of profound significance.\r\n\r\n(M1035) The empire then embraced all the countries bordering on the\r\nMediterranean—that great inland sea upon whose shores the most famous\r\ncities of antiquity flourished, and toward which the tide of Assyrian and\r\nPersian conquests had rolled, and then retreated for ever. The boundaries\r\nof this mighty empire were great mountains, and deserts, and oceans, and\r\nimpenetrable forests. On the east lay the Parthian empire, separated from\r\nthe Roman by the Tigris and Euphrates, and the Armenian Mountains, beyond\r\nwhich were other great empires not known to the Greeks, like the Indian\r\nand the Chinese monarchies, with a different civilization. On the south\r\nwere the African deserts, not penetrated even by travelers. On the west\r\nwas the ocean; and on the north were barbaric tribes of different names\r\nand races—Slavonic, Germanic, and Celtic. The empire extended over a\r\nterritory of one million six hundred thousand square miles, and among its\r\nprovinces were Spain, Gaul, Sicily, Africa, Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor,\r\nAchaia, Macedonia, and Illyricum—all tributary to Italy, whose capital was\r\nRome. The central province numbered four millions who were free, and could\r\nfurnish, if need be, seven hundred thousand foot, and seventy thousand\r\nhorse for the armies of the republic. It was dotted with cities, and\r\nvillages, and villas, and filled with statues, temples, and works of art,\r\nbrought from remotest provinces—the spoil of three hundred years of\r\nconquest. In all the provinces were great cities, once famous and\r\nindependent—centres of luxury and wealth—Corinth, Athens, Syracuse,\r\nCarthage, Alexandria, Antioch, Ephesus, Damascus, and Jerusalem, with\r\ntheir dependent cities, all connected with each other and the capital by\r\ngranite roads, all favored by commerce, all rejoicing in a uniform\r\ngovernment. Rome, the great mistress who ruled over one hundred and twenty\r\nmillions, contained an immense population, variously estimated, in which\r\nwere centred whatever wealth or power had craved. This capital had become\r\nrapidly ornamented with palaces, and temples, and works of art, with the\r\nsubjugation of Greece and Asia Minor, although it did not reach the climax\r\nof magnificence until the time of Hadrian. In the time of Augustus, the\r\nmost imposing buildings were the capitol, restored by Sulla and Cæsar,\r\nwhose gilded roof alone cost $15,000,000. The theatre of Pompey could\r\naccommodate eighty thousand spectators, behind which was a portico of one\r\nhundred pillars. Cæsar built the Forum Julium, three hundred and forty\r\nfeet long, and two hundred wide, and commenced the still greater\r\nstructures known as the Basilica Julia and Curia Julia. The Forum Romanum\r\nwas seven hundred feet by four hundred and seventy, surrounded with\r\nbasilica, halls, porticoes, temples, and shops—the centre of architectural\r\nsplendor, as well as of life and business and pleasure. Augustus restored\r\nthe Capitoline Temple, finished the Forum and Basilica Julia, built the\r\nCuria Julia, and founded the imperial palace on the Palatine, and erected\r\nmany temples, the most beautiful of which was that of Apollo, with columns\r\nof African marble, and gates of ivory finely sculptured. He also erected\r\nthe Forum Augusti, the theatre of Marcellus, capable of holding twenty\r\nthousand spectators, and that mausoleum which contained the ashes of the\r\nimperial family to the time of Hadrian, at the entrance of which were two\r\nEgyptian obelisks. It was the boast of this emperor, that he found the\r\ncity of brick and left her of marble. But great and beautiful as Rome was\r\nin the Augustan era, enriched not only by his own munificence, but by the\r\npalaces and baths which were erected by his ministers and courtiers,—the\r\nPantheon, the Baths of Agrippa, the Gardens of Mæcenas,—it was not until\r\nother emperors erected the Imperial Palace, the Flavian Amphitheatre, the\r\nForum Trajanum, the Basilica Ulpia, the Temple of Venus and Rome, the\r\nBaths of Caracalla, the Arches of Septimius Severus and Trajan, and other\r\nwonders, that the city became so astonishing a wonder, with its palaces,\r\ntheatres, amphitheatres, baths, fountains, bronze statues of emperors and\r\ngenerals, so numerous and so grand, that we are warranted in believing its\r\nglories, like its population, surpassed those of both Paris and London\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\n(M1036) And this capital and this empire seemed to be the domain of one\r\nman, so vast his power, so august his dignity, absolute master of the\r\nlives and property of one hundred and twenty millions, for the people were\r\nnow deprived of the election of magistrates and the creation of laws. How\r\ncould the greatest nobles otherwise than cringe to the supreme captain of\r\nthe armies, the prince of the Senate, and the high-priest of the national\r\ndivinities—himself, the recipient of honors only paid to gods! But\r\nAugustus kept up the forms of the old republic—all the old offices, the\r\nold dignities, the old festivals, the old associations. The Senate,\r\nprostrate and powerless, still had external dignity, like the British\r\nHouse of Peers. There were six hundred senators, each of whom possessed\r\nmore than one million two hundred thousand sesterces—about $50,000, when\r\nthat sum must have represented an amount equal to a million of dollars in\r\ngold, at the present time, and some of whom had an income of one thousand\r\npounds a day, the spoil of the provinces they had administered.\r\n\r\n(M1037) The Roman Senate, so august under the republic, still continued,\r\nwith crippled legislative powers, to wield important functions, since the\r\nordinary official business was performed by them. The provinces were\r\ngoverned by men selected from senatorial ranks. They wore the badges of\r\ndistinction; they had the best places in the circus and theatre; they\r\nbanqueted in the capitol at the public charge; they claimed the right to\r\nelect emperors.\r\n\r\n(M1038) The equestrian order also continued to farm the revenues of the\r\nprovinces, and to furnish judges. The knights retained external\r\ndecorations, were required to possess property equal to one-third of the\r\nsenators, and formed an aristocratic class.\r\n\r\n(M1039) The consuls, too, ruled, but with delegated powers from the\r\nemperor. They were his eyes, and ears, and voice, and hands; but neither\r\npolitical experience nor military services were required as qualifications\r\nof the office. They wore the wreath of laurel on their brow, the striped\r\nrobe of white and purple, and were attended with lictors. All citizens\r\nmade way for them, and dismounted when they passed, and rose in their\r\npresence. The prætors, too, continued to be the supreme judges, and the\r\nquæstors regulated the treasury. The tribunes existed also, but without\r\ntheir former independence. The prefect of the city was a new office, and\r\novershadowed all other offices—appointed by the emperor as his lieutenant,\r\nhis most efficient executive minister, his deputy in his absence from the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n(M1040) A standing army, ever the mark of despotism, became an imperial\r\ninstitution. At the head of this army were the prætorian guards, who\r\nprotected the person of the emperor, and had double pay over that of the\r\nordinary legionaries. They had a regular camp outside the city, and were\r\nalways on hand to suppress tumults. Twenty-five legions were regarded as\r\nsufficient to defend the empire, and each legion was composed of six\r\nthousand one hundred foot and seven hundred and twenty-six horse. They\r\nwere recruited with soldiers from the countries beyond Italy. Auxiliary\r\ntroops were equal to the legions, and all together numbered three hundred\r\nand forty thousand—the standing army of the empire, stationed in the\r\ndifferent provinces. Naval armaments were also established in the\r\ndifferent seas and in great frontier rivers.\r\n\r\nThe revenue for this great force, and the general expenses of the\r\ngovernment, were derived from the public domains, from direct taxes, from\r\nmines and quarries, from salt works, fisheries and forests, from customs\r\nand excise, from the succession to property, from enfranchisement of\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n(M1041) The monarchy instituted by Augustus, in all but the name, was a\r\npolitical necessity. Pompey would have ruled as the instrument of the\r\naristocracy, but he would only have been _primus inter pares_; Cæsar\r\nrecognized the people as the basis of sovereignty; Augustus based his\r\npower on an organized military establishment, of which he was the\r\npermanent head. All the soldiers swore personal fealty to him—all the\r\nofficers were appointed by him, directly or indirectly. But he paid\r\nrespect to ancient traditions, forms, and magistracies, especially to the\r\ndignity of the Senate, and thus vested his military power, which was his\r\ntrue power, under the forms of an aristocracy, which was the governing\r\npower before the constitution was subverted.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be said that the great mass of the people were\r\nindifferent to these political changes. The horrors of the Marian and\r\nSullan revolutions, the struggles of Cæsar and Pompey, and the awful\r\nmassacres of the triumvirs had alarmed and disgusted all classes, and they\r\nsought repose, security, and peace. Any government which would repress\r\nanarchy was, to them, the best. They wished to be spared from executions\r\nand confiscations. The great enfranchisement of foreign slaves, also,\r\ndegraded the people, and made them indifferent to the masters who should\r\nrule over them. All races were mingled with Roman citizens. The spoliation\r\nof estates in the civil wars cast a blight on agriculture, and the\r\npopulation had declined from war and misery.\r\n\r\n(M1042) Augustus, intrenched by military power, sought to revive not\r\nmerely patrician caste, but religious customs, which had declined. Temples\r\nwere erected, and the shrines of gods were restored. Marriage was\r\nencouraged, and the morals of the people were regulated by sumptuary laws.\r\nSevere penalties were enacted against celibacy, to which the people had\r\nbeen led by the increasing profligacy of the times, and the expenses of\r\nliving. Restrictions were placed on the manumission of slaves. The\r\npersonal habits of the imperator were simple, but dignified. His mansion\r\non the Palatine was moderate in size. His dress was that of a senator, and\r\nwoven by the hands of Livia and her maidens. He was courteous, sober,\r\ndecorous, and abstemious. His guests were chosen for their social\r\nqualities. Virgil and Horace, plebeian poets, were received at his table,\r\nas well as Pollio and Messala. He sought to guard morals, and revive\r\nancient traditions. He was jealous only of those who would not flatter\r\nhim. He freely spent money for games and festivals, and secured peace and\r\nplenty within the capital, where he reigned supreme. The people\r\nfelicitated themselves on the appearance of unbounded prosperity, and\r\nservile poets sung the praises of the emperor as if he were a god.\r\n\r\n(M1043) And, to all appearance, Rome was the most favored spot upon the\r\nglobe. Vast fleets brought corn from Gaul, Spain, Sicily, Sardinia,\r\nAfrica, and Egypt, to feed the four millions of people who possessed the\r\nworld. The capital was the emporium of all the luxuries of distant\r\nprovinces. Spices from the East, ivory, cotton, silk, pearls, diamonds,\r\ngums thither flowed, as well as corn, oil, and wine. A vast commerce gave\r\nunity to the empire, and brought all the great cities into communication\r\nwith each other and with Rome—the mighty mistress of lands and continents,\r\nthe directress of armies, the builder of roads, the civilizer and\r\nconservator of all the countries which she ruled with her iron hand. There\r\nwas general security to commerce, as well as property. There were order\r\nand law, wherever proconsular power extended. The great highways, built\r\noriginally for military purposes, extending to every part of the empire,\r\nand crossing mountains and deserts, and forests and marshes, and studded\r\nwith pillars and post-houses, contributed vastly to the civilization of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n(M1044) At this time, Rome herself, though not so large and splendid as in\r\nsubsequent periods, was the most attractive place on earth. Seven\r\naqueducts already brought water to the city, some over stone arches, and\r\nsome by subterranean pipes. The sepulchres of twenty generations lined the\r\ngreat roads which extended from the capital to the provinces. As these\r\nroads approached the city, they became streets, and the houses were dense\r\nand continuous. The seven original hills were covered with palaces and\r\ntemples, while the valleys were centres of a great population, in which\r\nwere the forums, the suburra, the quarter of the shops, the circus, and\r\nthe velabrum. The Palatine, especially, was occupied by the higher\r\nnobility. Here were the famous mansions of Drusus, of Crassus, of Cicero,\r\nof Clodius, of Scaurus, and of Augustus, together with the temples of\r\nCybele, of Juno Sospita, of Luna, of Febris, of Fortune, of Mars, and\r\nVesta. On the Capitoline were the Arx, or citadel, and the temple of\r\nJupiter. On the Pincian Hill were villas and gardens, including those of\r\nLucullus and Sallust. Every available inch of ground in the suburra and\r\nvelabrum was filled with dwellings, rising to great altitudes, even to the\r\nlevel of the Capitoline summit. The temples were all constructed after the\r\nGrecian models. The houses of the great were of immense size. The suburbs\r\nwere of extraordinary extent. The population exceeded that of all modern\r\ncities, although it has been, perhaps, exaggerated. It was computed by\r\nLipsius to reach the enormous number of four millions. Nothing could be\r\nmore crowded than the streets, whose incessant din was intolerable to\r\nthose who sought repose. And they were filled with idlers, as well as\r\ntrades-people, and artisans and slaves. All classes sought the excitement\r\nof the theater and circus—all repaired to the public baths. The\r\namphitheatres collected, also, unnumbered thousands within their walls to\r\nwitness the combats of beasts with man, and man with man. The gladiatorial\r\nsports were the most exciting exhibitions ever known in ancient or modern\r\ntimes, and were the most striking features of Roman society. The baths,\r\ntoo, resounded with shouts and laughter, with the music of singers and of\r\ninstruments, and even by the recitations of poets and lecturers. The\r\nluxurious Roman rose with the light of day, and received, at his levee, a\r\ncrowd of clients and retainers. He then repaired to the forum, or was\r\ncarried through the crowds on a litter. Here he presided as a judge, or\r\nappeared as a witness or advocate, or transacted his business affairs. At\r\ntwelve, the work of the day ceased, and he retired for his midday siesta.\r\nWhen this had ended, he recreated himself with the sports of the Field of\r\nMars, and then repaired to the baths, after which was the supper, or\r\nprincipal meal, in which he indulged in the coarsest luxuries, valued more\r\nfor the cost than the elegance. He reclined at table, on a luxurious\r\ncouch, and was served by slaves, who carved for him, and filled his cup,\r\nand poured water into his hand after every remove. He ate without knives\r\nor forks, with his fingers only. The feast was beguiled by lively\r\nconversation, or music and dancing.\r\n\r\n(M1045) At this period, the literature of Rome reached its highest purity\r\nand terseness. Livy, the historian, secured the friendship of Augustus,\r\nand his reputation was so high that an enthusiastic Spaniard traveled from\r\nCadiz on purpose to see him, and having gratified his curiosity,\r\nimmediately returned home. He took the dry chronicles of his country, drew\r\nforth from them the poetry of the old traditions, and incited a patriotic\r\nspirit. A friend of the old oligarchy, an aristocrat in all his prejudices\r\nand habits, he heaped scorn on tribunes and demagogues, and veiled the\r\ndespotism of his imperial master. Virgil also inflamed the patriotism of\r\nhis countrymen, while he flattered the tyrant in whose sunshine he basked.\r\nPatronized by Mæcenas, countenanced by Octavius, he sung the praises of\r\nlaw, of order, and of tradition, and attempted to revive an age of faith,\r\na love of agricultural life, a taste for the simplicities of better days,\r\nand a veneration of the martial virtues of heroic times. Horace ridiculed\r\nand rebuked the vices of his age, and yet obtained both riches and honors.\r\nHis matchless wit and transcendent elegance of style have been admired by\r\nevery scholar for nearly two thousand years. Propertius and Tibullus, and\r\nOvid, also adorned this age, never afterward equaled by the labors of men\r\nof genius. Literature and morals went hand in hand as corruption\r\naccomplished its work. The age of Augustus saw the highest triumph in\r\nliterature that Rome was destined to behold. Imperial tyranny was fatal to\r\nthat independence of spirit without which all literature languishes and\r\ndies. But the limit of this work will not permit an extended notice of\r\nRoman civilization. This has been attempted by the author in another work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIX CÆSARS OF THE JULIAN LINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have alluded to the centralization of political power in the person of\r\nOctavius. He simply retained all the great offices of State, and ruled,\r\nnot so much by a new title, as he did as consul, tribune, censor, pontifex\r\nmaximus, and chief of the Senate. But these offices were not at once\r\nbestowed.\r\n\r\nHis reign may be said to have commenced on the final defeat of his rivals,\r\nB.C. 29. Two years later, he received the title of Augustus, by which he\r\nis best known in history, although he was ordinarily called Cæsar. That\r\nproud name never lost its pre-eminence.\r\n\r\n(M1046) The first part of the reign was memorable for the organization of\r\nthe State, and especially of the army; and also for the means he used to\r\nconsolidate his empire. Augustus had no son, and but one daughter,\r\nalthough married three times. His first wife was Clodia, daughter of\r\nClodius; his second was Scribonia, sister-in-law of Sextus Pompey; and the\r\nthird was Livia Drusilla. The second wife was the mother of his daughter,\r\nJulia. This daughter was married to M. Claudius Marcellus, son of\r\nMarcellus and Octavia, the divorced wife of Antonius, and sister of\r\nOctavius. M. Claudius Marcellus thus married his cousin, but died two\r\nyears afterward. It was to his honor that Augustus built the theatre of\r\nMarcellus.\r\n\r\n(M1047) On the death of Marcellus, Augustus married his daughter Julia to\r\nAgrippa, his prime minister and principal lieutenant. The issue of this\r\nmarriage were three sons and two daughters. The sons died early. The\r\nyoungest daughter, Agrippina, married Germanicus, and was the mother of\r\nthe emperor Caligula. The marriage of Agrippina with Germanicus united the\r\nlines of Julia and Livia, the two last wives of Augustus, for Germanicus\r\nwas the son of Drusus, the younger son of Livia by her first husband,\r\nTiberius Claudius Nero. The eldest son of Livia, by Tiberius Claudius\r\nNero, was the emperor Tiberius Nero, adopted by Augustus. Drusus married\r\nAntonia, the daughter of Antonius the triumvir, and was the father, not\r\nonly of Germanicus, but of Claudius Drusus Cæsar, the fifth emperor.\r\nAnother daughter of Antonius, also called Antonia, married L. Domitius\r\nAhenobardus, whose son married Agrippina, the mother of Nero. Thus the\r\ndescendants of Octavia and Antony became emperors, and were intertwined\r\nwith the lines of Julia and Livia. The four successors of Augustus were\r\nall, in the male line, sprung from Livia’s first husband, and all, except\r\nTiberius, traced their descent from the defeated triumvir. Only the first\r\nsix of the twelve Cæsars had relationship with the Julian house.\r\n\r\nI mention this genealogy to show the descent of the first six emperors\r\nfrom Julia, the sister of Julius Cæsar, and grandmother of Augustus.\r\nAlthough the first six emperors were elected, they all belonged to the\r\nJulian house, and were the heirs of the great Cæsar.\r\n\r\n(M1048) When the government was organized, Augustus left the care of his\r\ncapital to Mæcenas, his minister of civil affairs and departed for Gaul,\r\nto restore order in that province, and build a series of fortifications to\r\nthe Danube, to check the encroachments of barbarians. The region between\r\nthe Danube and the Alps was peopled by various tribes, of different names,\r\nwho gave perpetual trouble to the Romans; but they were now apparently\r\nsubdued, and the waves of barbaric conquest were stayed for three hundred\r\nyears. Vindelicea and Rhætia were added to the empire, in a single\r\ncampaign, by Tiberius and Drusus, the sons of Livia—the emperor’s beloved\r\nwife. Agrippa returned shortly after from a successful war in the East,\r\nbut sickened and died B.C. 12. By his death Julia was again a widow, and\r\nwas given in marriage to Tiberius, whom Augustus afterward adopted as his\r\nsuccessor. Drusus, his brother, remained in Gaul, to complete the\r\nsubjugation of the Celtic tribes, and to check the incursions of the\r\nGermans, who, from that time, were the most formidable enemies of Rome.\r\n\r\n(M1049) What interest is attached to those Teutonic races who ultimately\r\nbecame the conquerors of the empire! They were more warlike, persevering,\r\nand hardy, than the Celts, who had been incorporated with the empire.\r\nTacitus has painted their simple manners, their passionate love of\r\nindependence, and their religious tendency of mind. They occupied those\r\nvast plains and forests which lay between the Rhine, the Danube, the\r\nVistula, and the German Ocean. Under different names they invaded the\r\nRoman world—the Suevi, the Franks, the Alemanni, the Burgundians, the\r\nLombards, the Goths, the Vandals; but had not, at the time of Augustus,\r\nmade those vast combinations which threatened immediate danger. They were\r\na pastoral people, with blue eyes, ruddy hair, and large stature, trained\r\nto cold, to heat, to exposure, and to fatigue. Their strength lay in their\r\ninfantry, which was well armed, and their usual order of battle was in the\r\nform of a wedge. They were accompanied even in war with their wives and\r\nchildren, and their women had peculiar virtue and influence. They inspired\r\nthat reverence which never passed away from the Germanic nations,\r\nproducing in the Middle Ages the graces of chivalry. All these various\r\ntribes had the same peculiarities, among which reverence was one of the\r\nmost marked. They were not idol worshipers, but worshiped God in the form\r\nof the sun, moon, and stars, and in the silence of their majestic groves.\r\nOdin was their great traditional hero, whom they made an object of\r\nidolatry. War was their great occupation, and the chase was their\r\nprincipal recreation and pleasure. Tacitus enumerates as many as fifty\r\ntribes of these brave warriors, who feared not death, and even gloried in\r\ntheir losses. The most powerful of these tribes, in the time of Augustus,\r\nwas the confederation of the Suevi, occupying half of Germany, from the\r\nDanube to the Baltic. Of this confederation the Cauci were the most\r\npowerful, living on the banks of the Elbe, and obtaining a precarious\r\nliving. In close connection with them were the Saxons and Longobardi\r\n(Long-beards). On the shores of the Baltic, between the Oder and the\r\nVistula, were the Goths.\r\n\r\n(M1050) The arms of Cæsar and Augustus had as yet been only felt by the\r\nsmaller tribes on the right bank of the Rhine, and these were assailed by\r\nDrusus, but only to secure his flank during the greater enterprise of\r\nsailing down the Rhine, to attack the people of the maritime plains. Great\r\nfeats were performed by this able step-son of Augustus, who advanced as\r\nfar as the Elbe, but was mortally injured by a fall from his horse. He\r\nlingered a month, and died, to the universal regret of the Romans, for he\r\nwas the ablest general sent against the barbarians since Julius Cæsar,\r\nB.C. 9. The effect of his various campaigns was to check the inroads of\r\nthe Germans for a century. It was at this time that the banks of the Rhine\r\nwere studded by the forts which subsequently became those picturesque\r\ntowns which now command the admiration of travelers.\r\n\r\n(M1051) After the death of Drusus, to whose memory a beautiful triumphal\r\narch was erected, Tiberius was sent against the Germans, and after\r\nsuccessful warfare, at the age of forty, obtained the permission of\r\nAugustus to retire to Rhodes, in order to improve his mind by the study of\r\nphilosophy, or, as it is supposed by many historians, from jealousy of\r\nCaius and Lucius Cæsar, the children of Julia and Agrippa—those young\r\nprinces to whom the throne of the world was apparently destined. At\r\nRhodes, Tiberius, now the ablest man in the empire, for both Agrippa and\r\nMæcenas were dead, lived in simple retirement for seven years. But the\r\nlevities of Julia, to which Augustus could not be blind, compelled him to\r\nbanish her—his only daughter—to the Campanian coast, where she died\r\nneglected and impoverished. The emperor was so indignant in view of her\r\ndisgraceful conduct, that he excluded her from any inheritance. The\r\npremature death of her sons nearly broke the heart of their grandfather,\r\nbereft of the wise councils and pleasant society of his great ministers,\r\nand bending under the weight of the vast empire which he, as the heir of\r\nCæsar, had received. The loss of his grandsons compelled the emperor to\r\nprovide for his succession, and he turned his eyes to Tiberius, his\r\nstep-son, who was then at Rhodes. He adopted him as his successor, and\r\ninvested him with the tribunitian power. But, while he selected him as his\r\nheir, he also required him to adopt Germanicus, the son of his brother\r\nDrusus.\r\n\r\n(M1052) Another great man now appeared upon the stage, L. Domitius\r\nAhenobardus, the son-in-law of Octavia and Antony, who was intrusted with\r\nthe war against the Germanic tribes, and who was the first Roman general\r\nto cross the Elbe. He was the grandfather of Nero. But Tiberius was sent\r\nto supersede him, and following the plan of his brother Drusus, he sent a\r\nflotilla down the Rhine, with orders to ascend the Elbe, and meet his army\r\nat an appointed rendezvous, which was then regarded as a great military\r\nfeat, in the face of such foes as the future conquerors of Rome. After\r\nthis Tiberius was occupied in reconquering the wide region between the\r\nAdriatic and the Danube, known as Illyricum, which occupied him three\r\nyears, A.D. 7-9. In this war he was assisted by his nephew and adopted\r\nson, Germanicus, whose brilliant career revived the hope which had centred\r\nin Drusus.\r\n\r\n(M1053) Meanwhile Augustus, wearied with the cares of State, provoked by\r\nthe scandals which his daughter occasioned, and irritated by plots against\r\nhis life, began to relax his attention to business, and to grow morose. It\r\nwas then that he banished Ovid, whose _Tristia_ made a greater sensation\r\nthan his immortal _Metamorphoses_. The disaster which befell Varus with a\r\nRoman army, in the forest of Teutoburg, near the river Lippe, when thirty\r\nthousand men were cut to pieces by the Germans under Arminius (Hermann),\r\ncompleted the humiliation of Augustus, for, in this defeat, he must have\r\nforeseen the future victories of the barbarians. All ideas of extending\r\nthe empire beyond the Rhine were now visionary, and that river was\r\nhenceforth to remain its boundary on the north. New levies were indeed\r\ndispatched to the Rhine, and Tiberius and Germanicus led the forces. But\r\nthe princes returned to Rome without effecting important results.\r\n\r\n(M1054) Soon after, in the year A.D. 14, Augustus died in his\r\nseventy-seventh year, after a reign of forty-four years from the battle of\r\nActium, and fifty from the triumvirate—one of the longest reigns in\r\nhistory, and one of the most successful. From his nineteenth year he was\r\nprominent on the stage of Roman public life. Under his auspices the empire\r\nreached the Elbe, and Egypt was added to its provinces. He planted\r\ncolonies in every province, and received from the Parthians the captured\r\nstandards of Crassus. His fleets navigated the Northern Ocean; his armies\r\nreduced the Pannonians and Illyrians. He added to the material glories of\r\nhis capital, and sought to secure peace throughout the world. He was both\r\nmunificent and magnificent, and held the reins of government with a firm\r\nhand. He was cultivated, unostentatious, and genial; but ambitious, and\r\nversed in all the arts of dissimulation and kingcraft. But he was a great\r\nmonarch, and ruled with signal ability. After the battle of Actium, his\r\nwars were chiefly with the barbarians, and his greatest generals were\r\nmembers of the imperial family. That he could have reigned so long, in\r\nsuch an age, with so many enemies, is a proof of his wisdom and\r\nmoderation, as well as of his good fortune. That he should have triumphed\r\nover such generals as Brutus, and Antonius, and Sextus—representing the\r\nold parties of the republic, is unquestionable evidence of transcendent\r\nability. But his great merit was his capacity to rule, to organize, and to\r\ncivilize. He is one of the best types of a sovereign ruler that the world\r\nhas seen. It is nothing against him, that, in his latter years, there were\r\npopular discontents. Such generally happen at the close of all long\r\nreigns, as in the case of Solomon and Louis XIV. And yet, the closing\r\nyears of his reign were melancholy, like those of the French monarch, in\r\nview of the extinction of literary glories, and the passing away of the\r\ngreat lights of the age, without the appearance of new stars to take their\r\nplace. But this was not the fault of Augustus, whose intellect expanded\r\nwith his fortunes, and whose magnanimity grew with his intellect—a man who\r\ncomprehended his awful mission, and who discharged his trusts with dignity\r\nand self-reliance.\r\n\r\nTiberius Cæsar, the third of the Roman emperors, found no opposition to\r\nhis elevation on the death of Augustus. He ascended the throne of the\r\nRoman world at the mature age of fifty-six, after having won great\r\nreputation both as a statesman and a general. He was probably the most\r\ncapable man in the empire, and in spite of all his faults, the empire was\r\nnever better administered than by him. His great misfortune and fault was\r\nthe suspicion of his nature, which made him the saddest of mankind, and\r\nfinally, a monster of cruelty.\r\n\r\n(M1055) Like Augustus, he veiled his power as emperor by assuming the old\r\noffices of the republic. A subservient Senate and people favored the\r\nconsolidation of the new despotism to which the world was now accustomed,\r\nand with power, which it cheerfully acquiesced as the best government for\r\nthe times. The last remnant of popular elections was abolished, and the\r\nComitia was transferred from the Campus Martius to the Senate, who elected\r\nthe candidate proposed by the emperor.\r\n\r\n(M1056) The first year of the accession of Tiberius was marked by mutinies\r\nin the legions, which were quelled by his nephew Germanicus, whose\r\npopularity was boundless, even as his feats had been heroic. This young\r\nprince, on whom the hopes of the empire rested, had married Agrippina, the\r\ndaughter of Julia and Agrippa, and traced through his mother Antonia, and\r\ngrandmother Octavia, a direct descent from Julia, the sister of the\r\ndictator. The blood of Antony also ran in his veins, as well as that of\r\nLivia. His wife was worthy of him, and was devotedly attached to him. By\r\nthis marriage the lines of Julia and Livia were united; and by his descent\r\nfrom Antony the great parties of the revolution were silenced. He was\r\nequally the heir of Augustus and of Antonius, of Julia and of Livia; and\r\nof all the chiefs of Roman history no one has been painted in fairer\r\ncolors. In natural ability, in military heroism, in the virtues of the\r\nheart, in exalted rank, he had no equal. As consul, general, and governor,\r\nhe called forth universal admiration. His mind was also highly cultivated,\r\nand he excelled in Greek and Latin verse, while his condescending and\r\ncourteous manners won both soldiers and citizens.\r\n\r\n(M1057) Of such a man, twenty-nine years of age, Tiberius was naturally\r\njealous, especially since, through his wife, Germanicus was allied with\r\nthe Octavian family and through his mother, with the sister of the great\r\nJulius; and, therefore, had higher claims than he, on the principle of\r\nlegitimacy. He was only the adopted son of Octavius, but Germanicus,\r\nthrough his mother Antonia, had the same ancestry as Octavius himself.\r\nMoreover, the cries of the legionaries, “Cæsar Germanicus will not endure\r\nto be a subject,” added to the fears of the emperor, that he would be\r\nsupplanted. So he determined to send his nephew on distant and dangerous\r\nexpeditions, against those barbarians who had defeated Varus.\r\n\r\n(M1058) Germanicus, no sooner than he had quelled the sedition in his\r\ncamp, set out for Germany with eight legions and an equal number of\r\nauxiliaries. With this large force he crossed the Rhine, revisited the\r\nscene of the slaughter of Varus, and paid funeral honors to the remains of\r\nthe fallen Romans. But the campaigns were barren of results, although\r\nattended with great expenses. No fortresses were erected to check the\r\nreturn of the barbarians from the places where they had been dislodged,\r\nand no roads were made to expedite future expeditions. Germanicus carried\r\non war in savage and barbarous tracts, amid innumerable obstacles, which\r\ntasked his resources to the utmost. Tiberius was dissatisfied with these\r\nresults, and vented his ill-humor in murmurs against his nephew. The Roman\r\npeople were offended at this jealousy, and clamored for his recall.\r\nGermanicus, however, embarked on a third campaign, A.D. 15, with renewed\r\nforces, and confronted the Germans on the Weser, and crossed the river in\r\nthe face of the enemy. There the Romans obtained a great victory over\r\nArminius, leader of the barbaric hosts, who retreated beyond the Elbe. The\r\ngreat German confederacy was, for a time, dispersed. Germanicus himself\r\nretired to the banks of the Rhine—which became the final boundary of the\r\nempire on the side of Germany. The hero who had persevered against\r\ninnumerable obstacles, in overcoming which the discipline and force of the\r\nRoman legions were never more apparent, not even under Julius Cæsar, was\r\nnow recalled to Rome, and a triumph was given him, amid the wildest\r\nenthusiasm of the Roman people. The young hero was the great object of\r\nattraction, as he was borne along in his triumphal chariot, surrounded by\r\nthe five male descendants of his union with Agrippina—his faithful and\r\nheroic wife. Tiberius, in the name of his adopted son, bestowed three\r\nhundred sesterces apiece upon all the citizens, and the Senate chose the\r\npopular favorite as consul for the ensuing year, in conjunction with the\r\nemperor himself.\r\n\r\n(M1059) Troubles in the East induced Tiberius to send Germanicus to Asia\r\nMinor, while Drusus was sent to Illyricum. This prince was the son of\r\nTiberius by his first wife, Vipsania, and was the cousin of Germanicus. He\r\nwas disgraced by the vices of debauchery and cruelty, and was finally\r\npoisoned by his wife, Livilla, at the instance of Sejanus. So long as\r\nGermanicus lived, the court was divided between the parties of Drusus and\r\nGermanicus, and Tiberius artfully held the balance of favor between them,\r\ntaking care not to declare which should be his successor. But Drusus was,\r\nprobably, the favorite of the emperor, although greatly inferior to the\r\nelder prince in every noble quality. Tiberius, in sending him to\r\nIllyricum, wished to remove him from the dissipations of the capital, and\r\nalso, to place a man in that important post who should be loyal to his\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n(M1060) In appointing Germanicus to the chief command of the provinces\r\nbeyond the Ægean, Tiberius also gave the province of Syria to Cnæus Piso,\r\nof the illustrious Calpurnian house, one of the proudest and most powerful\r\nof the Roman nobles. His wife, Plancina, was the favorite of Livia,—the\r\nempress-mother,—and he believed himself appointed to the government of\r\nSyria for the purpose of checking the ambitious designs which were imputed\r\nto Germanicus, while his wife was instructed to set up herself as a rival\r\nto Agrippina. The moment Piso quitted Italy, he began to thwart his\r\nsuperior, and to bring his authority into contempt. Yet he was treated by\r\nGermanicus with marked kindness. After visiting the famous cities of\r\nGreece, Germanicus marched to the frontiers of Armenia to settle its\r\naffairs with the empire—the direct object of his mission. He crowned a\r\nprince, called Zeno, as monarch of that country, reduced Cappadocia, and\r\nvisited Egypt, apparently to examine the political affairs of the\r\nprovince, but really to study its antiquities, even as Scipio had visited\r\nSicily in the heat of the Punic war. For thus going out of his way, he was\r\nrebuked by the emperor. He then retraced his steps, and shaped his course\r\nto Syria, where he found his regulations and appointments had been\r\noverruled by Piso, between whom and himself bitter altercations ensued.\r\nWhile in Syria, he fell sick and died, and his illness was attributed to\r\npoison administered by Piso, although there was little evidence to support\r\nthe charge.\r\n\r\n(M1061) The death of Germanicus was received with great grief by the Roman\r\npeople, and the general sorrow of the Roman world, and his praises were\r\npronounced in every quarter. He was even fondly compared to Alexander the\r\nGreat. His character was embellished by the greatest master of pathos\r\namong the Roman authors, and invested with a gleam of mournful splendor.\r\nHis remains were brought to Rome by his devoted wife, and the most\r\nsplendid funeral honors were accorded to him. Drusus, with the younger\r\nbrother and children of Germanicus, went forth to meet the remains, and\r\nthe consuls, the Senate, and a large concourse of people, swelled the\r\nprocession, as it neared the city. The precious ashes were deposited in\r\nthe Cæsarian mausoleum, and the memory of the departed prince was\r\ncherished in the hearts of the people. Whether he would have realized the\r\nexpectations formed of him, had he lived to succeed Tiberius, can not be\r\nknown. He, doubtless, had most amiable traits of character, while his\r\ntalents were undoubted. But he might have succumbed to the temptations\r\nincident to the most august situation in the world, or have been borne\r\ndown by its pressing cares, or have shown less talent for administration\r\nthan men disgraced by private vices. Had Tiberius died before Augustus,\r\nhis character would have appeared in the most favorable light, for he was\r\na man of great abilities, and was devoted to the interests of the empire.\r\nHe became moody, suspicious, and cruel, and yielded to the pleasures so\r\nlavishly given to the master of the world. When we remember the atmosphere\r\nof lies in which he lived,—as is the case with all absolute monarchs,\r\nespecially in venal and corrupt times,—the unbounded temptations, the\r\nservile and sycophantic attentions of his courtiers, the perpetual\r\nvexations and cares incident to such overgrown and unlimited powers, and\r\nthe disgust, satiety, and contempt which his experiences engendered, we\r\ncan not wonder that his character should change for the worse. And when we\r\nsee a man rendered uninteresting and unamiable by cares, temptations, and\r\nbursts of passion or folly, yet who still governs vigilantly and ably, our\r\nindignation should be modified, when the lower propensities are indulged.\r\nIt is not pleasant to palliate injustices, tyrannies, and lusts. But human\r\nnature, at the best, is weak. Of all men, absolute princes claim a\r\ncharitable judgment, and our eyes should be directed to their services,\r\nrather than to their defects. These remarks not only pertain to Tiberius,\r\nbut to Augustus, and many other emperors who have been harshly estimated,\r\nbut whose general ability and devotion to the interests of the empire are\r\nundoubted. How few monarchs have been free from the stains of occasional\r\nexcesses, and that arbitrary and tyrannical character which unlimited\r\npowers develop! Even the crimes of monsters, whom we execrate, are to be\r\ntraced to madness and intoxication, more than to natural fierceness and\r\nwickedness. But when monarchs _do_ reign in justice, and conquer the\r\ntemptations incident to their station, like the Antonines, then our\r\nreverence becomes profound. “Heavy is the head that wears a crown.” Kings\r\nare objects of our sympathy, as well as of our envy. Their burdens are as\r\nheavy as their temptations are great; and frivolous or wicked princes are\r\nalmost certain to yield, like Nero or Caligula, to the evils with which\r\nthey are peculiarly surrounded.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our narrative of the leading events connected with the\r\nreign of Tiberius, one of the ablest of all the emperors, so far as\r\nadministrative talents are concerned. After the death of Germanicus, which\r\nwas probably natural, the vengeance of the people and the court was\r\ndirected to his supposed murderer, Piso. He was arraigned and tried by the\r\nSenate, not only for the crime of which he was accused by the family of\r\nGermanicus, who thought himself poisoned, but for exceeding his powers as\r\ngovernor of Syria, which province he continued unwisely to claim. Tiberius\r\nabstained from all interference with the great tribunal which sat in\r\njudgment. He even checked the flow of popular feeling. Cold and hard, he\r\nallowed the trial to take its course, without betraying sympathy or\r\naversion, and acted with great impartiality. Piso found no favor from the\r\nSenate or the emperor, and killed himself when his condemnation was\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n(M1062) Relieved by the death of Germanicus and Piso, Tiberius began to\r\nreign more despotically, and incurred the hatred of the people, to which\r\nhe was apparently insensible. He was greatly influenced by his mother,\r\nLivia, an artful and ambitious princess, and by Sejanus, his favorite, a\r\nman of rare energy and ability, who was prefect of the prætorian guards.\r\nThis office, unknown to the republic, became the most important and\r\ninfluential under the emperors. The prefect was virtually the vizier, or\r\nprime minister, since it was his care to watch over the personal safety of\r\na monarch whose power rested on the military. The instruments of his\r\ngovernment, however, were the Senate, which he controlled especially by\r\nhis power as censor, and the law of _majestas_, which was virtually a\r\ngreat system of espionage and public accusation, which the emperor\r\nencouraged. But his general administration was marked by prudence, equity,\r\nand mildness. Under him the Roman dominion was greatly consolidated, and\r\nit was his policy to guard rather than extend the limits of the empire.\r\nThe legions were stationed in those provinces which were most likely to be\r\nassailed by external dangers, especially on the banks of the Rhine, in\r\nIllyricum, and Dalmatia. But they were scattered in all the provinces. The\r\ncity of Rome was kept in order by the prætorian guards. Their discipline\r\nwas strenuously maintained. Governors of provinces were kept several years\r\nin office, which policy was justified by the apologue he was accustomed to\r\nuse, founded on the same principle as that which is recognized in all\r\ncorrupt times by great administrators, whether of States, or factories, or\r\nrailroads. “A number of flies had settled on a soldier’s wound, and a\r\ncompassionate passer-by was about to scare them away. The sufferer begged\r\nhim to refrain. ‘These flies,’ he said, ‘have nearly sucked their full,\r\nand are beginning to be tolerable; if you drive them away, they will be\r\nimmediately succeeded by fresh-comers with keener appetites.’ ” The\r\nemperor saw the abuses which existed, but despaired to remedy them, since\r\nhe distrusted human nature. But there is no doubt that the government of\r\nthe provinces was improved under this prince, and the governors were made\r\nresponsible. The emperor also was assiduous to free Italy from robbers and\r\nbanditti, and in stimulating the diligence of the police, so that riots\r\nseldom occurred, and were severely punished. There was greater security of\r\nlife and property throughout the empire, and the laws were wise and\r\neffective. Tiberius limited the number of the gladiators, expelled the\r\nsoothsayers from Italy, and suppressed the Egyptian rites. The habits of\r\nthe people, even among the higher classes, were so generally disgraceful\r\nand immoral,—the dissipation was so widely spread, that Tiberius despaired\r\nto check it by sumptuary laws, but he restrained it all in his power. He\r\nwas indefatigable in his vigilance. For several years he did not quit the\r\ndin and dust of the city for a single day, and he lived with great\r\nsimplicity, apparently anxious to exhibit the ancient ideal of a Roman\r\nstatesman. He took no pleasure in the sports of the circus or theatre, and\r\nwas absorbed in the cares of office, as Augustus had been before him.\r\nAugustus, however, was a man of genius, while he was only a man of\r\nability, and his great defect was jealousy of the family of Germanicus,\r\nand the favor he lavished on Sejanus, who even demanded the hand of\r\nLivilla, the widow of Drusus,—a suit which Tiberius rejected.\r\n\r\n(M1063) Weariness of the cares of State, and the desire of repose, at last\r\ninduced Tiberius to retire from the city. He had neither happiness nor\r\nrest. He quarreled with Agrippina, the widow of Germanicus, and his temper\r\nwas exasperated by the imputations and slanders from which no monarch can\r\nescape. His enemies, however, declared that he had no higher wish than to\r\nexercise in secret the cruelty and libidinousness to which he was\r\nabandoned. For eleven years he ruled in the retirement of his guarded\r\nfortress, and never again re-entered the city he had left in disgust. But\r\nin this retirement, he did not relax his vigilance in the administration\r\nof affairs, although his government was exceedingly unpopular, and was\r\ndoubtless stained by many acts of cruelty. At Capreæ, a small island near\r\nNaples, barren and desolate, but beautiful in climate and scenery, the\r\nmaster of the world spent his latter years, surrounded with literary men\r\nand soothsayers. I do not believe the calumnies which have been heaped on\r\nthis imperial misanthrope. And yet, the eleven years he spent in his\r\nretreat were marked by great complaints against him, and by many revolting\r\ncrimes and needless cruelties. He persecuted the family of Germanicus,\r\nbanished Agrippina, and imprisoned her son, Drusus. Sejanus, however,\r\ninstigated these proceedings, and worked upon the jealousy of the emperor.\r\nThis favorite was affianced to Livilla, the widow of Drusus, and was made\r\nconsul conjointly with Tiberius.\r\n\r\n(M1064) Tiberius penetrated, at last, the character of this ambitious\r\nofficer, and circumvented his ruin with that profound dissimulation which\r\nwas one of his most marked traits. Sejanus conspired against his life, but\r\nthe emperor shrank from openly denouncing him to the Senate. He used\r\nconsummate craft in securing his arrest and execution, the instrument of\r\nwhich was Macro, an officer of his bodyguard, and his death was followed\r\nby the ruin of his accomplices and friends.\r\n\r\n(M1065) Shortly after the execution of Sejanus, Drusus, the son of\r\nAgrippina, was starved to death in prison, and many cruelties were\r\ninflicted on the friends of Sejanus. Tiberius now began to show signs of\r\ninsanity, and his life henceforth was that of a miserable tyrant. His\r\ncareer began to draw to a close, and he found himself, in his fits of\r\ndespair and wretchedness, supported by only three surviving members of the\r\nlineage of Cæsar: Tiberius Claudius Drusus, the last of the sons of\r\nDrusus, and nephew of the emperor, infirm in health and weak in mind, and\r\nhad been excluded from public affairs; Caius, the younger son of\r\nGermanicus, and Tiberius, the son of the second Drusus,—the one,\r\ngrand-nephew, and the other, grandson, of the emperor. Both were young;\r\none twenty-five, the other eighteen. The failing old man failed to\r\ndesignate either as his successor, but the voice of the public pointed out\r\nthe son of Germanicus, nicknamed Caligula. At the age of seventy-eight,\r\nthe tyrant died, unable in his last sickness to restrain his appetite. He\r\ndied at Misenum, on his way to Capreæ, which he had quitted for a time, to\r\nthe joy of the whole empire; for his reign, in his latter years, was one\r\nof terror, which caused a deep gloom to settle upon the face of the higher\r\nsociety at Rome, A.D. 37. The body was carried to Rome with great pomp,\r\nand its ashes were deposited in the mausoleum of the Cæsars. Caius was\r\nrecognized as his successor without opposition, and he commenced his reign\r\nby issuing a general pardon to all State prisoners, and scattering, with\r\npromiscuous munificence, the vast treasures which Tiberius had\r\naccumulated. He assumed the collective honors of the empire with modesty,\r\nand great expectations were formed of a peaceful and honorable reign.\r\n\r\nCaligula was the heir of the Drusi, grandson of Julia and Agrippa,\r\ngreat-grandson of Octavius, of Livia, and of Antony. In him the lines of\r\nJulia and Livia were united. His defects and vices were unknown to the\r\npeople, and he made grand promises to the Senate. He commenced his reign\r\nby assiduous labors, and equitable measures, and professed to restore the\r\ngolden age of Augustus. His popularity with the people was unbounded, from\r\nhis lavish expenditure for shows and festivals, by the consecration of\r\ntemples, and the distribution of corn and wine.\r\n\r\n(M1066) But it was not long before he abandoned himself to the most\r\nextravagant debauchery. His brain reeled on the giddy eminence to which he\r\nhad been elevated without previous training and experience. Augustus\r\nfought his own way to power, and Tiberius had spent the best years of his\r\nlife in the public service before his elevation. Yet even he, with all his\r\nexperience and ability, could not resist the blandishments of power. How,\r\nthen, could a giddy and weak young man, without redeeming qualities? He\r\nfell into the vortex of pleasures, and reeling in the madness which\r\nexcesses caused, was soon guilty of the wildest caprices, and the most\r\ncruel atrocities. He was corrupted by flattery as well as pleasure. He\r\neven descended into the arena of the circus as a charioteer, and the races\r\nbecame a State institution. In a few months he squandered the savings of\r\nthe previous reign, swept away the wholesome restraints which Augustus and\r\nTiberius had imposed upon gladiators, and carried on the sports of the\r\namphitheatre with utter disregard of human life. His extravagance and his\r\nnecessities led to the most wanton murders of senators and nobles whose\r\ncrime was their wealth. The most redeeming features of the first year of\r\nhis reign were his grief at the death of his sister, his friendship with\r\nHerod Agrippa, to whom he gave a sovereignty in Palestine, and the\r\nactivity he displayed in the management of his vast inheritance. He had a\r\ngreat passion for building, and completed the temple of Augustus,\r\nprojected the grandest of the Roman aqueducts, enlarged the imperial\r\npalace, and carried a viaduct from the Palatine to the Capitoline over the\r\nlofty houses of the Velabrum. But his prodigalities led to a most\r\noppressive taxation, which soon alienated the people, while his senseless\r\ndebaucheries, especially his costly banquets, disgusted the more\r\ncontemplative of the nobles. He was also disgraced by needless cruelties,\r\nand it was his exclamation: “Would that the people of Rome had but one\r\nneck!” His vanity was preposterous. He fancied himself divine, and\r\ninsisted on divine honors being rendered to him. He systematically\r\npersecuted the nobles, and exacted contributions. He fancied himself, at\r\none time an orator, and at another a general; and absolutely led an army\r\nto the Rhine, when there was no enemy to attack. He married several wives,\r\nbut divorced them with the most fickle inconstancy.\r\n\r\n(M1067) It is needless to repeat the wanton follies of this young man who\r\nso outrageously disgraced the imperial station. The most charitable\r\nconstruction to be placed upon acts which made his name infamous among the\r\nancients is that his brain was turned by his elevation to a dignity for\r\nwhich he was not trained or disciplined—that unbounded power, united with\r\nthe most extravagant abandonment to sensual pleasures, undermined his\r\nintellect. His caprices and extravagance can only be explained by partial\r\nmadness. He had reigned but four years, and all expectations of good\r\ngovernment were dispelled. The majesty of the empire was insulted, and\r\nassassination, the only way by which he could be removed, freed the world\r\nfrom a madman, if not a monster.\r\n\r\nThere was great confusion after the assassination of Caius Cæsar, and\r\nill-concerted efforts to recover a freedom which had fled forever, ending,\r\nas was to be expected, by military power. The consuls convened the Senate\r\nfor deliberation (for the forms of the republic were still kept up), but\r\nno settled principles prevailed. Various forms of government were proposed\r\nand rejected. While the Senate deliberated, the prætorian guards acted.\r\n\r\n(M1068) Among the inmates of the palace, in that hour of fear, among\r\nslaves and freed men, half hidden behind a curtain in an obscure corner,\r\nwas a timid old man, who was dragged forth with brutal violence. He was no\r\nless a personage than Claudius, the neglected uncle of the emperor, the\r\nson of Drusus and Antonia, and nephew of Tiberius, and brother of\r\nGermanicus. Instead of slaying the old man, the soldiers, respecting the\r\nfamily of Cæsar, hailed him, partly in jest, as imperator, and carried him\r\nto their camp. Claudius, heretofore thought to be imbecile, and therefore\r\ndespised, was not unwilling to accept the dignity, and promised the\r\nprætorians, if they would swear allegiance to him, a donation of fifteen\r\nthousand sesterces apiece. The Senate, at the dictation of the prætorians,\r\naccepted Claudius as emperor.\r\n\r\n(M1069) He commenced his reign, A.D. 41, by proclaiming a general amnesty.\r\nHe restored confiscated estates, recalled the wretched sisters of Caius,\r\nsent back to Greece and Asia the plundered statues of temples which Caius\r\nhad transported to Rome, and inaugurated a _régime_ of moderation and\r\njustice. His life had been one of sickness, neglect, and obscurity, but he\r\nwas suffered to live because he was harmless. His mother was ashamed of\r\nhim, and his grandmother, Livia, despised him, and his sister, Livilla,\r\nridiculed him. He was withheld from public life, and he devoted himself to\r\nliterary pursuits, and even wrote a history of Roman affairs from the\r\nbattle of Actium, but it gained him no consideration. Tiberius treated him\r\nwith contumely, and his friends deserted him. All this neglect and\r\ncontempt were the effects of a weak constitution, a paralytic gait, and an\r\nimperfect utterance.\r\n\r\n(M1070) Claudius took Augustus as his model, and at once a great change in\r\nthe administration was observable. There was a renewed activity of the\r\narmies on the frontiers, and great generals arose who were destined to be\r\nfuture emperors. The colonies were strengthened and protected, and foreign\r\naffairs were conducted with ability. Herod Agrippa, the favorite of Caius,\r\nwas confirmed in his government of Galilee, and received in addition the\r\ndominions of Samaria and Judæa. Antiochus was restored to the throne of\r\nCommagene, and Mithridates received a district of Cilicia. The members of\r\nthe Senate were made responsible for the discharge of their magistracies,\r\nand vacancies to this still august body were filled up from the wealthy\r\nand powerful families. He opened an honorable career to the Gauls, revised\r\nthe lists of the knights, and took an accurate census of Roman citizens.\r\nHe conserved the national religion, and regulated holidays and festivals.\r\nHis industry and patience were unwearied, and the administration of\r\njustice extorted universal admiration. His person was accessible to all\r\npetitioners, and he relieved distress wherever he found it. He\r\nrelinquished the most grievous exactions of his predecessors, and tenderly\r\nguarded neglected slaves. He also constructed great architectural works,\r\nespecially those of utility, completed the vast aqueduct which Caius\r\ncommenced, and provided the city with provisions. He built the port of\r\nOstia, to facilitate commerce, and drained marshes and lakes. The draining\r\nof the Lake Fucinus occupied thirty thousand men for eleven years. While\r\nhe executed vast engineering works to supply the city with water, he also\r\namused the people with gladiatorial shows. In all things he showed the\r\nforce of the old Roman character, in spite of bodily feebleness.\r\n\r\n(M1071) The most memorable act of his administration was the conquest of\r\nSouth Britain. By birth a Gaul, being born at Lugdunum, he cast his eyes\r\nacross the British channel and resolved to secure the island beyond as the\r\nextreme frontier of his dominions, then under the dominion of the Druids—a\r\nbody of Celtic priests whom the Romans ever detested, and whose rites all\r\npreceding emperors had proscribed. Julius Cæsar had pretended to impose a\r\ntribute on the chiefs of Southern Britain, but it was never exacted. Both\r\nAugustus and Tiberius felt but little interest in the political affairs of\r\nthat distant island, but the rapid progress of civilization in Gaul, and\r\nthe growing cities on the banks of the Rhine, elicited a spirit of\r\nfriendly intercourse. Londinium, a city which escaped the notice of Cæsar,\r\nwas a great emporium of trade in the time of Claudius. But the southern\r\nchieftains were hostile, and jealous of their independence. So Claudius\r\nsent four legions to Britain, under Plautius, and his lieutenant,\r\nVespasianus, to oppose the forces under Caractacus. He even entered\r\nBritain in person, and subdued the Trinobantes. But for nine years\r\nCaractacus maintained an independent position. He was finally overthrown\r\nin battle, and betrayed to the Romans, and exhibited at Rome. The\r\ninsurrection was suppressed, or rather, a foothold was secured in the\r\nisland, which continued henceforth under the Roman rule.\r\n\r\n(M1072) The feeble old man, always nursed by women, had the misfortune to\r\nmarry, for his third wife, the most infamous woman in Roman annals\r\n(Valeria Messalina), under whose influence the reign, at first beneficent,\r\nbecame disgraceful. Claudius was entirely ruled by her. She amassed\r\nfortunes, sold offices, confiscated estates, and indulged in guilty loves.\r\nShe ruled like a Madame de Pompadour, and degraded the throne which she\r\nought to have exalted. The influence of women generally was bad in those\r\ncorrupt times, but her influence was scandalous and degrading.\r\n\r\nClaudius also was governed by his favorites, generally men of low\r\nbirth—freedmen who usurped the place of statesmen. Narcissus and Pallus\r\nwere the most confidential of the emperor’s advisers, who, in consequence,\r\nbecame enormously rich, for favors flowed through them, and received the\r\ngreat offices of State. The court became a scene of cabals and crimes,\r\ndisgraced by the wanton shamelessness of the empress and the venality of\r\ncourtiers. Appius Silanus, one of the best and greatest of the nobles, was\r\nmurdered through the intrigues of Messalina, to whose progress in\r\nwickedness history furnishes no parallel, and Valerius Asiaticus, another\r\ngreat noble, also suffered the penalty of offending her, and was\r\ndestroyed; and his magnificent gardens, which she coveted, were bestowed\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\n(M1073) But Messalina was rivaled in iniquity by another princess, between\r\nwhom and herself there existed the deadliest animosity. Thus was\r\nAgrippina, the daughter of Germanicus, who had been married to Cn.\r\nDomitius Ahenobardus, grandson of Octavia, and whose issue was the future\r\nemperor Nero. The niece of Claudius occupied the second place in the\r\nimperial household, and it became her aim to poison the mind of her uncle\r\nagainst the woman she detested, and who returned her hatred. She now\r\nleagued with the freedmen of the palace to destroy her rival. An\r\nopportunity to gratify her vengeance soon occurred. Messalina, according\r\nto Tacitus, was guilty of the inconceivable madness of marrying Silanus,\r\none of her paramours, while her husband lived, and that husband an\r\nemperor, which story can not be believed without also supposing that\r\nClaudius was a perfect idiot. Such a defiance of law, of religion, and of\r\nthe feelings of mankind, to say nothing of its folly, is not to be\r\nsupposed. Yet such was the scandal, and it filled the imperial household\r\nwith consternation. Callistus, Pallas, and Narcissus—the favorites who\r\nruled Claudius—united with Agrippina to secure her ruin. The emperor, then\r\nabsent in Ostia, was informed of the shamelessness of his wife. It was\r\ndifficult for him to believe such a fact, but it was attested by the\r\ntrusted members of his household. His fears were excited, as well as his\r\nindignation, and he hastened to Rome for vengeance and punishment.\r\nMessalina had retired to her magnificent gardens on the Pineian, which had\r\nonce belonged to Lucullus, the price of the blood of the murdered\r\nAsiaticus; but, on the approach of the emperor, of which she was informed,\r\nshe advanced boldly to confront him, with every appearance of misery and\r\ndistress, with her children Britannicus and Octavia. Claudius vacillated,\r\nand Messalina retired to her gardens, hoping to convince her husband of\r\nher innocence on the interview which he promised the following day. But\r\nNarcissus, knowing her influence, caused her to be assassinated, and the\r\nemperor drowned his grief, or affection, or anger, in wine and music, and\r\nseemingly forgot her. That Messalina was a wicked and abandoned woman is\r\nmost probable; that she was as bad as history represents her, may be\r\ndoubted, especially when we remember she was calumniated by a rival, who\r\nsucceeded in taking her place as wife. It is easier to believe she was the\r\nvictim of Agrippina and the freedmen, who feared as well as hated her,\r\nthan to accept the authority of Tacitus and Juvenal. On the death of\r\nMessalina, Agrippina married her uncle, and the Senate sanctioned the\r\nunion, which was incest by the Roman laws.\r\n\r\n(M1074) The fourth wife of the emperor transcended the third in intrigue\r\nand ambition, and her marriage, at the age of thirty-three, was soon\r\nfollowed by the betrothal of her son, L. Domitius, a boy of twelve, with\r\nOctavia, the daughter of Claudius and Messalina. He was adopted by the\r\nemperor, and assumed the name of Nero. Henceforth she labored for the\r\nadvancement of her son only. She courted the army and the favor of the\r\npeople, and founded the city on the Rhine which we call Cologne. But she\r\noutraged the notions and sentiments of the people more by her unfeminine\r\nusurpation of public honors, than by her cruelty or her dissoluteness. She\r\nseated herself by the side of the emperor in military festivals. She sat\r\nby him at a sea-fight on the Lucrine Lake, clothed in a soldier’s cloak.\r\nShe took her station in front of the Roman standard, when Caractacus, the\r\nconquered British chief, was brought in chains to the emperor’s tribunal.\r\nShe caused the dismissal of the imperial officers who incurred her\r\ndispleasure. She exercised a paramount sway over her husband, and\r\nvirtually ruled the empire. She distracted the palace with discords,\r\ncabals, and jealousies.\r\n\r\nHow the bad influence of these women over the mind of Claudius can be\r\nreconciled with the vigilance, and the labors, and the beneficent measures\r\nof the emperor, as generally admitted, history does not narrate. But it\r\nwas during the ascendency of both Messalina and Agrippina, that Claudius\r\npresided at the tribunals of justice with zeal and intelligence, that he\r\ninterested himself in works of great public utility, and that he carried\r\non successful war in Britain.\r\n\r\n(M1075) In the year A.D. 54, and in the fourteenth of his reign, Claudius,\r\nexhausted by the affairs of State, and also, it is said, by intemperance,\r\nfell sick at Rome, and sought the medicinal waters of Sinuessa. It was\r\nthere that Agrippina contrived to poison him, by the aid of Locusta, a\r\nprofessed poisoner, and Xenophon, a physician, while she affected an\r\nexcess of grief. She held his son Britannicus in her arms, and detained\r\nhim and his sisters in the palace, while every preparation was made to\r\nsecure the accession of her own son, Nero. She was probably prompted to\r\nthis act from fear that she would be supplanted and punished, for Claudius\r\nhad said, when wine had unloosed his secret thoughts, “that it was his\r\nfate to suffer the crimes of his wives, but at last to punish them.” She\r\nalso was eager to elevate her own son to the throne, which, of right,\r\nbelonged to Britannicus, and whose rights might have been subsequently\r\nacknowledged by the emperor, for his eyes could not be much longer blinded\r\nto the character of his wife.\r\n\r\n(M1076) Claudius must not be classed with either wicked or imbecile\r\nprinces, in spite of his bodily infirmities, or the slanders with which\r\nhis name is associated. It is probable he indulged to excess in the\r\npleasures of the table, like the generality of Roman nobles, but we are to\r\nremember that he ever sought to imitate Augustus in his wisest measures;\r\nthat he ever respected letters when literature was falling into contempt;\r\nthat his administration was vigorous and successful, fertile in victories\r\nand generals; that he exceeded all his ministers in assiduous labors, and\r\nthat he partially restored the dignity and authority of the Senate. His\r\ngreat weakness was in being ruled by favorites and women; but his\r\nfavorites were men of ability, and his women were his wives.\r\n\r\n(M1077) Nero, the son of Agrippina and Cn. Domitius Ahenobardus, by the\r\nassistance of the prætorian guards, was now proclaimed imperator, A.D. 54,\r\ndirectly descended, both on his paternal and maternal side, from Antonia\r\nMajor, the granddaughter of Antony and Domitius Ahenobardus. Through\r\nOctavia, his grandmother, he traced his descent from the family of Cæsar.\r\nThe Domitii—the paternal ancestors of Nero—had been illustrious for\r\nseveral hundred years, and no one was more distinguished than Lucius\r\nDomitius, called Ahenobardus, or Red-Beard, in the early days of the\r\nrepublic. The father of Nero, who married Agrippina, was as infamous for\r\ncrimes as he was exalted for rank. But he died when his son Nero was three\r\nyears of age. He was left to the care of his father’s sister, Domitia\r\nLepida, the mother of Messalina, and was by her neglected. His first\r\ntutors were a dancer and a barber. On the return of his mother from exile\r\nhis education was more in accordance with his rank, as a prince of the\r\nblood, though not in the line of succession. He was docile and\r\naffectionate as a child, and was intrusted to the care of Seneca, by whom\r\nhe was taught rhetoric and moral philosophy, and who connived at his taste\r\nfor singing, piping, and dancing, the only accomplishments of which, as\r\nemperor, he was afterward proud. He was surrounded with perils, in so\r\nwicked an age, as were other nobles, and, by his adoption, was admitted a\r\nmember of the imperial family—the sacred stock of the Claudii and Julii.\r\nHe was under the influence of his mother—the woman who subverted\r\nMessalina, and murdered Claudius,—who used every art and intrigue to\r\nsecure his accession.\r\n\r\n(M1078) When he mounted the throne of the Cæsars, he gave promise of a\r\nbenignant reign. His first speech to the Senate made a good impression,\r\nand his first acts were beneficent. But he ruled only through his mother,\r\nwho aspired to play the empress, a woman who gave answers to ambassadors,\r\nand sent dispatches to foreign courts. Burrhus, the prefect of the\r\nimperial guard, and Seneca, tutor and minister, through whose aid the\r\nclaims of Nero had been preferred over those of Britannicus, the son of\r\nthe late emperor, opposed her usurpations, and attempted to counteract her\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n(M1079) The early promises of Nero were not fulfilled. He soon gave vent\r\nto every vice, which was disguised by his ministers. One of the first acts\r\nwas to disgrace the freedman, Pallas,—the prime minister of Claudius,—and\r\nto destroy Britannicus by poison, which crimes were palliated, if not\r\nsuggested, by Seneca.\r\n\r\n(M1080) The influence which Seneca and Burrhus had over the young emperor,\r\nwho screened his vices from the eyes of the people and Senate, necessarily\r\nled to a division between Nero and Agrippina. He withdrew her guard of\r\nhonor, and paid her only formal visits, which conduct led to the desertion\r\nof her friends, and the open hostility of her enemies. The wretched woman\r\ndefended herself against the charges they brought, with spirit, and for a\r\ntime she escaped. The influence of Seneca, at this period, was paramount,\r\nand was exerted for the good of the empire, so that the Senate acquiesced\r\nin the public measures of Nero, and no notice was taken of his private\r\nirregularities. The empress mother apparently yielded to the ascendency of\r\nthe ministers, and provoked no further trial of strength.\r\n\r\n(M1081) Thus five years passed, until Nero was twenty-two, when Poppæa\r\nSabina, the fairest woman of her time, appeared upon the stage. Among the\r\ndissolute women of imperial Rome, she was pre-eminent. Introduced to the\r\nintimacy of Nero, she aspired to still higher elevation, and this was\r\nfavored by the detestation with which Agrippina was generally viewed, and\r\nthe continued decline of her influence, since she had ruled by fear rather\r\nthan love. Poppæa was now found intriguing against her, and induced Nero\r\nto murder his own mother, to whose arts and wickedness he owed his own\r\nelevation. The murder was effected in her villa, on the Lucrine Lake,\r\nunder circumstances of utter brutality. Nero came to examine her mangled\r\nbody, and coolly praised the beauty of her form. Nor were her ashes even\r\nplaced in the mausoleum of Augustus. This wicked Jezebel, who had poisoned\r\nher husband, and was accused of every crime revolting to our nature, paid\r\nthe penalty of her varied infamies, and her name has descended to all\r\nsubsequent ages as the worst woman of antiquity.\r\n\r\n(M1082) With the murder of Agrippina, the madness and atrocities of Nero\r\ngained new force. He now appears as a monster, and was only tolerated for\r\nthe amusements with which he appeased the Roman people. He disgraced the\r\nimperial dignity by descending upon the stage, which was always infamous;\r\nhe instituted demoralizing games; he was utterly insensible to national\r\nsentiments and feelings; he exceeded all his predecessors in extravagance\r\nand follies; he was suspected of poisoning Burrhus, by whom he was\r\nadvanced to power; he executed men of the highest rank, whose crime was\r\ntheir riches; he destroyed the members of the imperial family; he murdered\r\nDoryphorus and Pallas, because they were averse to his marriage with\r\nPoppæa; he drove his chariot in the Circus Maximus, pleased with the\r\nacclamations of two hundred thousand spectators; he gave banquets in which\r\nthe utmost excesses of bacchanalian debauchery were openly displayed; he\r\nis said to have kindled the conflagration of his own capital; he levied\r\noppressive taxes to build his golden palace, and support his varied\r\nextravagance; he even destroyed his tutor and minister, Seneca, that he\r\nmight be free from his expostulations, and take possession of the vast\r\nfortune which this philosopher had accumulated in his service; and he\r\nfinally kicked his wife so savagely that she died from the violence he\r\ninflicted. If it were possible to add to his enormities, his persecution\r\nof the Christians swelled the measure of his infamies—the first to which\r\nthey had been subjected in Rome, and in which Paul himself was a victim.\r\nBut his government was supported by the cruelty and voluptuousness of the\r\nage, and which has never been painted in more vivid colors than by St.\r\nPaul himself. The corrupt morality of the age tolerated all these crimes,\r\nand excesses, and follies—an age which saw no great writers except Seneca,\r\nLucan, Perseus, and Martial, two of whom were murdered by the emperor.\r\n\r\n(M1083) But the hour of retribution was at hand. The provinces were\r\ndiscontented, and the city filled with cabals and conspiracies. Though one\r\nof them, instigated by Piso, was unsuccessful, and its authors punished, a\r\nrevolt in Gaul, headed by Galba—an old veteran of seventy-two, and\r\nassisted by Vindex and Virginius, was fatal to Nero. The Senate and the\r\nprætorian guards favored the revolution. The emperor was no longer safe in\r\nhis capital. Terrified by dreams, and stung by desertion, the wretched\r\ntyrant fled to the Servilian Gardens, and from thence to the villa of one\r\nof his freedmen, near which he committed suicide, at the age of\r\nthirty-six, and in the fourteenth year of his inglorious reign, during\r\nwhich there are scarcely other events to chronicle than his own personal\r\ninfamies. “In him perished the last scion of the stock of the Julii,\r\nrefreshed in vain by grafts from the Octavii, the Claudii, and the\r\nDomitii.” Though the first of the emperors had married four wives, the\r\nsecond three, the third two, the fourth three, the fifth six, and the\r\nsixth three, yet Nero was the last of the Cæsars. None of the five\r\nsuccessors of Julius were truly his natural heirs. They trace their\r\nlineage to his sister Julia, but the three last had in their veins the\r\nblood of Antony as well as Octavia, and thus the descendants of the\r\ntriumvir reigned at Rome as well as those of his rival Octavius. We have\r\nonly to remark that it is strange that the Julian line should have been\r\nextinguished in the sixth generation, with so many marriages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLIMAX OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the extinction of the Julian line, a new class of emperors succeeded,\r\nby whom the prosperity of the empire was greatly advanced. We have now to\r\nfall back on Niebuhr, Gibbon, and the Roman historians, and also make more\r\nuse of Smith’s digest of these authors. But so much ground still remains\r\nto go over, that we can only allude to salient points, and our notice of\r\nsucceeding emperors must be brief.\r\n\r\n(M1084) The empire was now to be the prize of successful soldiers, and\r\nGalba, at the age of seventy-three, was saluted imperator by the legions\r\nbefore the death of Nero, A.D. 68, and acknowledged by the Senate soon\r\nafter. There is nothing memorable in his short reign of a few months, and\r\nhe was succeeded by Otho, who only reigned three months, and he was\r\nsucceeded by Vitellius, who was removed by violent death, like Galba and\r\nOtho. These three emperors left no mark, and were gluttons and\r\nsensualists, who excited nothing but contempt; soldiers of fortune—only\r\nrespectable in inferior rank.\r\n\r\n(M1085) On the first of July, A.D. 69, Titus Flavius Vespasianus, of\r\nhumble family, arose, as general, to the highest honors of the State, and\r\nwas first proclaimed emperor at Alexandria, at the close of the Jewish\r\nwar, which he conducted to a successful issue. A brief contest with\r\nVitellius secured his recognition by the Senate, and the first of the\r\nFlavian line began to reign—a man of great talents and virtues. On the\r\nfall of Jerusalem, his son Titus returned to Rome, and celebrated a joint\r\ntriumph with his father, and the gates of the temple of Janus were\r\nshut,—the first time since Augustus,—and universal peace was proclaimed.\r\n\r\n(M1086) One of the first acts of the new emperor was to purify the Senate,\r\nreduced to two hundred members, soon followed by the restoration of the\r\nfinances. He rebuilt the capitol, erected the temple of Peace, the new\r\nforum, the baths of Titus, and the Coliseum. He extended a generous\r\npatronage to letters, and under his reign Quintilian, the great\r\nrhetorician, and Pliny, the naturalist, flourished. It was in the ninth\r\nyear of his reign that an eruption of Vesuvius occurred, when Herculaneum\r\nand Pompeii were destroyed, to witness which Pliny lost his life.\r\nVespasian had associated with himself his son Titus in the government, and\r\ndied, after a reign of ten years, exhausted by the cares of empire; and\r\nTitus quietly succeeded him, but reigned only for two years and a quarter,\r\nand was succeeded by his brother, Domitian, a man of some ability, but\r\ncruel, like Nero. He was ten years younger than Titus, and was thirty\r\nyears of age when proclaimed emperor by the prætorians, and accepted by\r\nthe Senate, A.D. 81. At first he was a reformer, but soon was stained by\r\nthe most odious vices. He continued the vast architectural works of his\r\nfather and brother, and patronized learning.\r\n\r\n(M1087) It was during the reign of Domitian that Britain was finally\r\nconquered by Agricola, who was recalled by the jealousy of the emperor,\r\nafter a series of successes which gave him immortality. The reduction of\r\nthis island did not seriously commence until the reign of Claudius. By\r\nNero, Suetonius Paulinus was sent to Britain, and under him Agricola took\r\nhis first lessons of soldiership. Under Vespasian he commanded the\r\ntwentieth legion in Britain, and was the twelfth Roman general sent to the\r\nisland. On his return to Rome he was made consul, and Britain was assigned\r\nto him as his province, where he remained seven years, until he had\r\nextended his conquests to the Grampian Hills. He taught the Britons the\r\narts and luxuries of civilized life, to settle in towns, and to build\r\nhouses and temples. Among the foes he encountered, the most celebrated was\r\nBoadicea, queen of the Iceni, on the eastern coast, who led the incredible\r\nnumber of two hundred and forty thousand against the Roman legions, but\r\nwas defeated, with the loss of eighty thousand,—some atonement for the\r\nseventy thousand Romans, and their allies, who had been slain at\r\nLondinium, when Suetonius Paulinus commanded.\r\n\r\n(M1088) The year of Agricola’s recall, A.D. 84, forms the epoch of the\r\nundisguised tyranny which Domitian subsequently exercised. The reign of\r\ninformers and proscriptions recommenced, and many illustrious men were\r\nexecuted for insufficient reasons. The Christians were persecuted, and the\r\nphilosophers were banished, and yet he received the most fulsome flattery\r\nfrom the poet Martial. The tyrant lived in seclusion, in his Alban villa,\r\nand was finally assassinated, after a reign of fifteen years, A.D. 96.\r\n\r\n(M1089) On his death a new era of prosperity and glory was inaugurated, by\r\nthe election of Nerva, and for five successive reigns the Roman world was\r\ngoverned with virtue and ability. It is the golden era of Roman history,\r\npraised by Gibbon and admired by all historians, during which the eyes of\r\ncontemporaries saw nothing but to panegyrize.\r\n\r\n(M1090) Marcus Cocceius Nerva was the great-grandson of a minister of\r\nOctavius, and was born in Umbria. He was consul with Vespasian, A.D. 71,\r\nand with Domitian, in A.D. 90, and was far advanced in life when chosen by\r\nthe Senate. The public events of his short but beneficent reign are\r\nunimportant. He relieved poverty, diminished the expenses of the State,\r\nand set, in his own life, an example of republican simplicity. But he did\r\nnot reign long enough to have his character tested. He died in sixteen\r\nmonths after his elevation to the purple. His chief work was to create a\r\ntitle for his successor, for he assumed the right of adoption, and made\r\nchoice of Trajan, without regard to his own kin, then at the head of the\r\narmies of Germany.\r\n\r\n(M1091) The new emperor, one of the most illustrious that ever reigned at\r\nRome, was born in Spain, A.D. 52, and had spent his life in the camp. He\r\nhad a tall and commanding form, was social and genial in his habits, and\r\ninspired universal respect. No better choice could have been made. He\r\nentered his capital without pomp, unattended by guards, distinguished only\r\nfor the dignity of his bearing, allowing free access to his person, and\r\npaying vows to the gods of his country. His wife, Plotina, bore herself as\r\nthe spouse of a simple senator, and his sister, Marciana, exhibited a\r\ndemeanor equally commendable.\r\n\r\n(M1092) The great external event of his reign was the war against the\r\nDacians, and their country was the last which the Romans subdued in\r\nEurope. They belonged to the Thracian group of nations, and were identical\r\nwith the Getæ. They inhabited the country which was bordered on the south\r\nby the Danube and Mœsia. They were engaged in frequent wars with the\r\nRomans, and obtained a decided advantage, in the reign of Domitian, under\r\ntheir king Decebalus. The honor of the empire was so far tarnished as to\r\npay a tribute to Dacia, but Trajan resolved to wipe away the disgrace, and\r\nheaded himself an expedition into this distant country, A.D. 101, with\r\neighty thousand veterans, subdued Decebalus, and added Dacia to the\r\nprovinces of the empire. He built a bridge over the Danube, on solid stone\r\npiers, about two hundred and twenty miles below the modern Belgrade, which\r\nwas a remarkable architectural work, four thousand five hundred and\r\nseventy feet in length. Enough treasures were secured by the conquest of\r\nDacia to defray the expenses of the war, and of the celebrated triumph\r\nwhich commemorated his victories. At the games instituted in honor of this\r\nconquest, eleven thousand beasts were slain, and ten thousand gladiators\r\nfought in the Flavian Amphitheatre. The column on which his victories were\r\nrepresented still remains to perpetuate his magnificence, with its two\r\nthousand five hundred figures in bas-relief, winding in a spiral band\r\naround it from the base to the summit—one of the most interesting relics\r\nof antiquity. Near this column were erected the Forum Trajanum, and the\r\nBasilica Ulpia, the former one thousand one hundred feet long, and the\r\nbasilica connected with it, surrounded with colonnades, and filled with\r\ncolossal statues. This enormous structure covered more ground than the\r\nFlavian Amphitheatre, and was built by the celebrated Apollodorus, of\r\nDamascus. It filled the whole space between the Capitoline and the\r\nQuirinal. The double colonnade which surrounded it was one of the most\r\nbeautiful works of art in the world.\r\n\r\nOn the conquest of Dacia, Trajan devoted himself to the internal\r\nadministration of his vast empire. He maintained the dignity of the\r\nSenate, and allowed the laws to take their course. He was untiring in his\r\nefforts to provide for the material wants of his subjects, and in\r\ndeveloping the resources of the empire, nor did he rule by oppressive\r\nexactions.\r\n\r\n(M1093) After seven years of wise administration, he again was called into\r\nthe field to extend the eastern frontier of the empire. His efforts were\r\ndirected against Armenia and Parthia. He reduced the former to a Roman\r\nprovince, and advanced into those Caucasian regions where no Roman\r\nimperator had preceded him, except Pompey, receiving the submission of\r\nIberians and Albanians. To overthrow Parthia was now his object, and he\r\nadvanced across the Tigris to Ctesiphon. In the Parthian capital he was\r\nsaluted as imperator; but, oppressed with gloom and enfeebled by sickness,\r\nhe did not presume to reach, as he had aspired, the limits of the\r\nMacedonian conquest. He was too old for such work. He returned to Antioch,\r\nsickened, and died in Cilicia, August, A.D. 117, after a prosperous and\r\neven glorious reign of nineteen and a half years. But he had the\r\nsatisfaction of having raised the empire to a state of unparalleled\r\nprosperity, and of having extended its limits on the east and on the west\r\nto the farthest point it ever reached.\r\n\r\n(M1094) Publius Ælius Hadrian succeeded this great emperor, and was born\r\nin Rome A.D. 76, and was a son of the first cousin of Trajan. He made\r\nextraordinary attainments as a youth, and served honorably in the armies\r\nof his country, especially during the Dacian wars. At twenty-five he was\r\nquæstor, at thirty-one he was prætor, and in the following year was made\r\nconsul, for the forms of the old republic were maintained under the\r\nemperors. He was adopted by Trajan, and left at the head of the army at\r\nAntioch at the age of forty-two, when Trajan died on his way to Rome. He\r\nwas at once proclaimed emperor by the army, and its choice was confirmed\r\nby the Senate.\r\n\r\n(M1095) He entered upon his reign with matured knowledge and experience,\r\nand sought the development of the empire rather than its extension beyond\r\nthe Euphrates. He therefore withdrew his armies from Armenia, Mesopotamia,\r\nand Parthia, and returned to Rome to celebrate, in Trajan’s name, a\r\nmagnificent triumph, and by employing the spoils of war in largesses and\r\nremission of taxes. Averse to the extension of the empire, he still aimed\r\nto secure its limits from hostile inroads, and was thus led to repel\r\ninvasions in Dacia and Britain. He marched at the head of his legions,\r\nbareheaded and on foot, as far as Mœsia, and in another campaign through\r\nGaul to the Rhine, and then crossed over to Britain, and secured the\r\nnorthern frontier, by a wall sixty-eight and a half miles in length,\r\nagainst the Caledonians. He then returned to Gaul, passed through Spain,\r\ncrossed the straits to Mauritania, threatened by the Moors, restored\r\ntranquillity, and then advanced to the frontiers of Parthia. He then\r\nreturned through Asia Minor, and across the Ægean to Athens, and commenced\r\nthe splendid works with which he adorned the intellectual capital of the\r\nempire. Before returning to Rome, he visited Carthage and Sicily.\r\n\r\n(M1096) Five years later, he made a second progress through the empire,\r\nwhich lasted ten years, with some intervals, spent in his capital,\r\nresiding chiefly at Athens, constructing great architectural works, and\r\nholding converse with philosophers and scholars. During this period he\r\nvisited Alexandria, whose schools were rivaled only by those of Athens,\r\nstudying the fantastic philosophy of the Gnostics, and probably examining\r\nthe Christian system. He ascended the Nile as far as Thebes, and then\r\nrepaired to Antioch, and returned to Rome through Asia Minor. In his\r\nprogress, he not merely informed himself of the condition of the empire,\r\nbut corrected abuses, and made the Roman rule tolerable.\r\n\r\n(M1097) His remaining years were spent at Rome, diligently administrating\r\nthe affairs of his vast government, founding libraries and schools, and\r\ndecorating his capital with magnificent structures. His temple of Venus at\r\nRome was the largest ever erected in the city, and his mausoleum, stripped\r\nof its ornaments, now forms the Castle of St. Angelo. Next to the\r\nColiseum, it was the grandest architectural monument in Rome. He also\r\nbuilt a villa at Tivoli, whose remains are among the most interesting\r\nwhich seventeen centuries have preserved.\r\n\r\nThis good emperor made a noble choice for his successor, Titus Aurelius\r\nAntonius, and soon after died childless, A.D. 138, after a peaceful reign\r\nof twenty-one years, in which, says Merivale, “he reconciled, with eminent\r\nsuccess, things hitherto found irreconcilable: a contented army and a\r\npeaceful frontier; an abundant treasury with lavish expenditure; a free\r\nSenate and stable monarchy; and all this without the lustre of a great\r\nmilitary reputation, the foil of an odious predecessor, or disgust at\r\nrecent civil commotions. He recognized, in theory, both conquerors and\r\nconquered as one people, and greeted in person every race among his\r\nsubjects.” He had personal defects of character, but his reign is one of\r\nthe best of the imperial series, and marked the crowning age of Roman\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n(M1098) Antonius Pius, his successor, had less ability, but a still more\r\nfaultless character. He sprung from the ranks of the nobility; was consul\r\nin the third year of Hadrian, and was prefect of Asia until his adoption,\r\nwhen he took up his residence in Rome, and never left its neighborhood\r\nduring the remainder of his life. His peaceful reign is barren of external\r\nevents, but fruitful in the peace and security of his subjects, and the\r\nonly drawback in his happiness was the licentious character of his wife,\r\nwho bore him two sons and two daughters. The sons died before his\r\nelevation, but one of his daughters married M. Annius Verus, whom he\r\nadopted as his successor, and associated with him in the government of the\r\nempire. He died after a reign of twenty-three years, and was buried in the\r\nmausoleum of Hadrian, which he completed. His character is thus drawn by\r\nhis son-in-law and successor, Marcus Aurelius: “In my father, I noticed\r\nmildness of manner with firmness of resolution, contempt of vainglory,\r\nindustry in business, and accessibility of person. He knew how to relax,\r\nas well as when to labor. From him I learned to acquiesce in every\r\nfortune, to exercise foresight in public affairs, to rise superior to\r\nvulgar praises, to worship the gods without superstition, to serve mankind\r\nwithout ambition, to be sober and steadfast, to be content with little, to\r\nbe no sophist or dreaming bookworm, to be practical and active, to be neat\r\nand cheerful, to be temperate, modest in dress, and indifferent to the\r\nbeauty of slaves and furniture, not to be led away by novelties, yet to\r\nrender honor to true philosophers.” What a picture of a heathen emperor,\r\ndrawn by a pagan philosopher!—the single purpose of ruling for the\r\nhappiness of their subjects, and realizing the idea of a paternal\r\ngovernment, and this in one of the most corrupt periods of Roman society.\r\n\r\n(M1099) Marcus Aurelius, like Trajan and Hadrian, derived his origin from\r\nSpain, but was born in Italy. His features are the most conspicuously\r\npreserved in the repositories of ancient art, as his name is the most\r\nhonorably enshrined on the pages of history—the noblest and most august\r\ntype of the ancient rulers of the world, far transcending any Jewish king\r\nin the severity of his virtues, and the elevation of his soul. His life\r\nwas modeled on the strictest discipline of the stoical philosophy, of\r\nwhich he was the brightest ornament. He was nearly forty years of age on\r\nthe death of his father-in-law, although for twenty-three years he had sat\r\nside by side with him on the tribunals of the State. His reign, therefore,\r\nwas virtually a long one, and he was devoted to all the duties which his\r\nstation imposed. He was great as ruler, as he was profound as a\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\n(M1100) It was under his illustrious reign that the barbarians formed a\r\ngeneral union for the invasion of the Roman world, and struck the first of\r\nthose fatal blows under which the empire finally succumbed. We have but\r\nlittle information of the long contest with Germans, Sarmatians,\r\nMarcomanni, Quadi, and Alani, on the banks of the Danube, who were pressed\r\nforward by the Scythian tribes. They were repelled, indeed, but they soon\r\nafter advanced, with renovated forces, when the empire was weakened by the\r\nmiserable emperors who succeeded Aurelius. And although this great prince\r\ncommemorated his victory over the barbarians by a column similar to that\r\nof Trajan, still they were far from being subdued, and a disgraceful\r\npeace, which followed his death, shows that they were exceedingly\r\nformidable. He died at Sirmium, or Vindobona (Vienna), exhausted by\r\nincessant wars and the cares of State, A.D. 180, in the fifty-ninth year\r\nof his age, and twentieth of his reign. The concurrent testimony of\r\nhistorians represents this emperor as the loftiest character that ever\r\nwielded a sceptre among the nations of antiquity, although we can not\r\nforget that he was a persecutor of the Christians.\r\n\r\n(M1101) His son, Commodus, succeeded him, and the thirteen years of his\r\ninglorious reign are summed up in conflicts with the Moors, Dacians, and\r\nGermans. Skillful generals, by their successes, warded off the attacks of\r\nbarbarians, but the character and rule of the emperor resembled that of\r\nNero and Domitian. He was weak, cruel, pleasure-seeking, and dissolute.\r\nHis time was divided between private vices and disgraceful public\r\nexhibitions. He fought as a gladiator more than seven hundred times, and\r\nagainst antagonists whose only weapons were tin and lead. He also laid\r\nclaim to divinity, and was addicted to debasing superstitions. He\r\ndestroyed the old ministers of his father, and decimated the Senate. All\r\nwho excited his jealousy, or his covetousness, were put out of the way. He\r\nwas poisoned by his favorite mistress, Marcia, and the Senate set the\r\nbrand of infamy on his name. Thus perished the last of the line of the\r\nAntonines, even as the Julian line was ended by the assassination of Nero,\r\nand the Flavian by that of Domitian, and the empire became once again the\r\nprize of the soldier, A. D. 192.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECLINE OF THE EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n(M1102) Able or virtuous princes had now ruled the Roman world, with a few\r\nexceptions, from Julius Cæsar to Commodus, a period of more than two\r\nhundred years. Among these were some odious tyrants, or madmen, who were\r\nremoved by assassination. But some of these very tyrants governed with\r\nability, and such was the general prosperity, such the wonderful mechanism\r\nof government for which the Romans had a genius, that the general\r\ncondition of the world was better than at any preceding period. All that\r\ngovernment could do to preserve and extend civilization was done, on the\r\nwhole. Despotism was not signally oppressive, and the _regime_ of\r\nAugustus, of Vespasian, and Hadrian was generally maintained. The Roman\r\ngovernors, appointed by the emperors, ruled more wisely and beneficently\r\nthan in the time of the republic. Peace, security, and law reigned, and,\r\nin consequence, the population increased, civilization advanced, and\r\nwealth was accumulated. The whole empire rejoiced in populous cities, in\r\nworks of art, in literary culture, and in genial manners. Society was\r\npagan, but attractive, and Rome herself was the resort of travelers, the\r\ncentre of fashion and glory, the joy and the pride of the whole earth.\r\nThere were no destructive wars, except on the frontiers; all classes were\r\nsecure, the face of nature was cultivated and beautiful, and poets sung\r\nthe praises of civilization such as never existed but in isolated cities\r\nand countries.\r\n\r\n(M1103) But now we observe the commencement of a great and melancholy\r\nchange. Prosperity had led to vice, false security, and pride. All classes\r\nhad become corrupt. Disproportionate fortunes, slavery, and luxury\r\nundermined the moral health, and destroyed not only elevation of sentiment\r\nbut martial virtues. Literature declined in spirit and taste, and was\r\ndirected to frivolous subjects. Christianity had not become a power\r\nsufficiently strong to change or modify the corrupt institutions\r\ncontrolled by the powerful classes. The expensive luxury of the nobles was\r\nalmost incredible. The most distant provinces were ransacked for game,\r\nfish, and fowl for the tables of the great. Usury was practiced at a\r\nruinous rate. Every thing was measured by the money standard. Art was\r\nprostituted to please degraded tastes. There was no dignity of character;\r\nwomen were degraded; only passing vanities made any impression on\r\negotistical classes; games and festivals were multiplied; gladiatorial\r\nsports outraged humanity; the descendants of the proudest families prided\r\nthemselves chiefly on their puerile frivolities; the worst rites of\r\npaganism were practiced; slaves performed the most important functions;\r\nthe circus and the theatre were engrossing pleasures; the baths were the\r\nresort of the idle and the luxurious, who almost lived in them, and were\r\nscenes of disgraceful orgies; great extravagance in dress and ornaments\r\nwas universal; the pleasures of the table degenerated to riotous excesses;\r\ncooks, buffoons, and dancers received more consideration than scholars and\r\nphilosophers; everybody worshiped the shrine of mammon; all science was\r\ndirected to utilities that demoralized; sensualism reigned triumphant, and\r\nthe people lived as if there were no God.\r\n\r\n(M1104) Such a state must prepare the way for violence, and when external\r\ndangers came there were not sufficient virtues to meet them. But the\r\ndecline was gradual, and dangers were still at a distance. Both nature and\r\nart were the objects of perpetual panegyric, and the worldly and sensual\r\nRomans dreamed only of a millennium of protracted joys.\r\n\r\nThe last experiment of a constitutional empire was succeeded by\r\nundisguised military despotism, and no one now desired or expected the\r\nrestoration of the republic. The Senate was servile and submissive, the\r\npeople had no voice in public affairs, and the prefects of the imperial\r\nguard were the recognized lieutenants and often masters of the emperors.\r\n\r\n(M1105) Pertinax succeeded to the sceptre of Commodus, a wise and good\r\nman, and great hopes were entertained of a beneficent reign, when they\r\nwere suddenly blasted by a sedition of the prætorians, only eighty-six\r\ndays after the death of Commodus, and these guards publicly sold the\r\nempire to Didius Julianus, a wealthy senator, at the price of one thousand\r\ndollars to each soldier. Such a bargain disgusted the capital, and raised\r\nthe legions in the provinces to revolt. Each of the three principal armies\r\nset up their own candidate, but L. Septimius Severus, who commanded in\r\nIllyricum, was the fortunate one, and was confirmed by the Senate. Didius\r\nJulianus was murdered after a brief reign of sixty-six days, and the\r\nprætorians who had created the scandal were disbanded.\r\n\r\nThe reign of this general was able and fortunate, although he was cruel\r\nand superstitious. His vigor prevented the separation of the empire for a\r\ncentury; but he had powerful rivals in Clodius Albinus, in Britain, and\r\nPescennius Niger, in Syria, both of whom he subdued. At Lyons it is said\r\nthat one hundred and fifty thousand Romans fought on both sides, when\r\nAlbinus was killed. The full of Niger at the Hellespont insured the\r\nsubmission of the East, and the victorious emperor penetrated as far as\r\nCtesiphon, and received the submission of Mesopotamia and Arabia. The\r\ntriumphal arch erected by him celebrated those military successes.\r\n\r\n(M1106) Having bestowed peace, and restored the dignity of the empire,\r\nthis martial prince established an undisguised military despotism, and\r\nthrew aside all deference to the Senate. He created a new guard of\r\nprætorian soldiers four times as numerous as the old, which were recruited\r\nfrom the ranks of the barbarians, who thus began to overawe the capital.\r\nThe commander of this great force was no less a man than the celebrated\r\njurist, Papianus, and he was the prime minister of the emperor. It was\r\nduring his reign that a violent persecution of the Christians took place,\r\nA.D. 200, which called out the famous apology of Tertullian. Severus died\r\nin Britain, to which he was summoned by an irruption of Caledonians, A.D.\r\n211, having reigned nineteen years, and with a vigor worthy of Trajan.\r\n\r\n(M1107) He left two sons, who are best known by the names of Caracalla and\r\nGeta, and both of whom, in their father’s lifetime, had been raised to the\r\ndignity of Augustus. The oldest son succeeded to the empire, and the year\r\nafter his elevation murdered his brother in his mother’s arms. He also\r\nexecuted Papinian, the prætorian prefect, because he refused to justify\r\nthe fratricide, together with twenty thousand persons who were the friends\r\nof Geta. After this wholesale murder he left his capital, and never\r\nreturned to it, spending his time in different provinces, which were\r\nalternately the scene of his cruelty and rapine, a victim of the foulest\r\nsuperstitions of the East, and arrogant and vainglorious as he was savage.\r\nHis tyranny became unendurable, and he was murdered by an agent of the\r\nprætorian prefect, A.D. 217, Opilius Macrinus, who became the next\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n(M1108) Macrinus was only elevated to the purple by promising rich\r\ndonations to the soldiers, for his rank was only that of a knight. He\r\nundertook to restore discipline in the army, and the licentious soldiery\r\nfound a new candidate for the empire in the person of Avitus, of the\r\nfamily of Severus, a beautiful boy of seventeen, who officiated as priest\r\nof the sun in Syria, and whose name in history, from the god he served, is\r\ncalled Elagabalus, or Heliogabalus. But Macrinus was at the head of a\r\nformidable force, and fought his rival with bravery, but without success.\r\nThe battle was decided against him, and he was overtaken in flight and put\r\nto death, A.D. 218.\r\n\r\n(M1109) With Elagabalus is associated the most repulsive and loathsome\r\nreign of all the emperors. He was guilty of the most shameless\r\nobscenities, and the most degrading superstitions. He painted and dressed\r\nhimself like an Oriental prince; he banqueted in halls hung with cloth of\r\ngold, and enriched with jewels; he slept on mattresses stuffed with down\r\nfound only under the wings of partridges; he dined from tables of pure\r\ngold; he danced in public, arrayed in the garb of a Syrian priest; and he\r\ncollected in his capital all the forms of idolatry and all the hideous\r\nabominations which even Grecian paganism despised. This wretch, who\r\ninsulted every consecrated sentiment, was murdered after a reign of little\r\nmore than three years, A.D. 222, and his body was thrown into the Tiber,\r\nand his memory branded with infamy by the Senate.\r\n\r\n(M1110) The prætorians, who now controlled the State, offered the purple\r\nto his cousin, Alexander Severus, grand-nephew of Septimius Severus, an\r\nemperor who adorned those degenerate times, and who resembled the great\r\nAurelius in the severity of his virtues. His prime minister—the prefect of\r\nthe prætorian guards—was the celebrated Ulpian, the greatest of Roman\r\njurists, and next to him in dignity and power was the historian, Dion\r\nCassius, consul, governor in Africa, and legate in Dalmatia.\r\n\r\n(M1111) The great labors of Alexander Severus were to quell the mutinous\r\nspirit of the prætorian guards, who reveled in the spoil of the empire; to\r\nsubdue the Persians; and to repel barbarian inroads on the western\r\nfrontiers. It was while he was in Thrace that a young barbarian of\r\ngigantic stature solicited permission to contend for the prize of\r\nwrestling. Sixteen of the stoutest Roman soldiers he successively\r\noverthrew, and he was permitted to enlist among the troops. The next day\r\nhe attracted the notice of the emperor, and again contended successfully\r\nwith seven of the Roman champions, and received, at the hand of the\r\nemperor, a gold collar and a place in the body-guard. He rose, step by\r\nstep, till appointed to discipline the recruits of the army of the Rhine.\r\nHe became the favorite of the army, and was saluted as imperator. Severus\r\nfled to his tent, and was assassinated, A.D. 235.\r\n\r\n(M1112) The savage, Maximin, who now governed the empire, ruled like a\r\nbarbarian, as he was, disdaining all culture, and hostile to all\r\nrefinements. Confiscations, exile, or death awaited the few illustrious\r\nmen who adorned the age. Only brute force was recognized as a claim to\r\nimperial favor. The sole object of Maximin was to secure the favor of the\r\nsoldiers, barbarians like himself, whom he propitiated with exorbitant\r\ndonations, extorted by fines and confiscations, and derived from the sack\r\nof temples. He lived in the camp, and knew nothing of the cities he ruled.\r\n\r\n(M1113) Such outrages of course provoked rebellion, and M. Antonius\r\nGordianus, the proconsul of Africa, a descendant of the Gracchi and of\r\nTrajan, distinguished for wealth and culture, was proclaimed emperor, at\r\nthe age of eighty, who associated with him, in the government, his son.\r\nThe Senate confirmed the Gordians, who fixed their court at Carthage, but\r\nMaximin suppressed the insurrection, and proceeded to Rome to satisfy his\r\nvengeance. The Senate, in despair, conferred the purple on two members of\r\ntheir own body, Maximus, an able soldier, and Balbinus, a poet and orator.\r\nThe prætorians supported their claims, and Maximin was assassinated in his\r\ntent, A.D. 238. But the new emperors had scarcely given promise of a wise\r\nadministration, before they in turn were assassinated by the prætorians,\r\nand Gordian, a grandson of the first of that name, was elevated to the\r\nimperial dignity. He, again, was soon murdered in a mutiny of the\r\nsoldiers, who elected Philip as his successor, A.D. 244. This emperor,\r\nwhose reign was marked by the celebration of the secular games with\r\nunwonted magnificence, to commemorate the one thousand years since Rome\r\nwas founded, was put to death by the prætorian guards the following year,\r\nand the dignity of Augustus was conferred on Decius.\r\n\r\n(M1114) His reign is memorable for a savage persecution of the Christians,\r\nand the victories of the Goths, who, in the preceding reign, had\r\npenetrated to Dacia, and conquered Mœsia. The next twenty years were\r\nmournful and disgraceful. The emperor marched against these barbarians in\r\nperson, but was defeated by them in Thrace, and lost his life at a place\r\ncalled Abrutum, A.D. 251. The Goths continued their ravages along the\r\ncoasts of the Euxine, and made themselves masters of the Crimea. They then\r\nsailed, with a large fleet, to the northern parts of the Euxine, took\r\nPityus and Trapezus, attacked the wealthy cities of the Thracian\r\nBosphorus, conquered Chalcedon, Nicomedia, and Nice, and retreated laden\r\nwith spoil. The next year, with five hundred boats, they pursued their\r\ndestructive navigation, destroyed Cyzicus, crossed the Ægean, landed at\r\nAthens, plundered Thebes, Argos, Corinth and Sparta, advanced to the\r\ncoasts of Epirus, and devastated the whole Illyrian peninsula. In their\r\nravages they destroyed the famous temple of Ephesus, and, wearied with\r\nplunder, returned through Mœsia to their own settlements beyond the\r\nDanube.\r\n\r\n(M1115) During this raid, the son of Decius, Hostilianus, reigned in\r\nconjunction with Gallus, one of the generals of Decius, but were put to\r\ndeath by Æmilianus, governor of Pannonia and Mœsia, who had succeeded in\r\ngaining a victory over the new and terrible enemy. He was in turn\r\noverthrown by Valerianus—a nobleman of great distinction, who signalized\r\nhimself by considerable military ability, and who associated with himself\r\nin the empire his son, Gallienus, A.D. 253, whose frivolities were an\r\noffset to the virtues of his father. Valerian was taken prisoner by Sapor,\r\nking of Persia, and shortly after died, and the Roman world relapsed under\r\nthe sway of his son, and at a time of great calamity, memorable for the\r\nsuccesses of the Goths, and the direst pestilence which had ever visited\r\nthe empire. Gallienus—not without accomplishments, but utterly unfit to\r\ngovern an empire in the stormy times which witnessed the fierce irruptions\r\nof the Goths—was slain by a conspiracy of his officers, A.D. 268.\r\n\r\n(M1116) The empire was now threatened by barbarians, and wasted by\r\npestilence, and distracted by rebellions and riots. It was on the verge of\r\nruin; but the ruin was averted for one hundred years by a succession of\r\ngreat princes, who traced their origin to the martial province of\r\nIllyricum. The first of these emperors was Claudius, one of the generals\r\nof Gallienus, and was fifty-four years of age when invested with the\r\npurple. He led the armies of the waning empire against the Alemanni, who\r\nhad invaded Italy, and drove them beyond the Alps. But a fiercer tribe of\r\nGermanic barbarians remained to be subdued or repelled—those who had\r\ndevastated Greece—the Goths. They again appeared upon the Euxine with a\r\nfleet, variously estimated from two thousand to six thousand vessels,\r\ncarrying three hundred and twenty thousand men. A division of this vast,\r\nbut undisciplined force, invaded Crete and Cyprus, but the main body\r\nravaged Macedonia, and undertook the siege of Thessalonica. Claudius\r\nadvanced to meet them, and gained at Naissus a complete victory, where\r\nfifty thousand of the barbarians perished. A desultory war followed in\r\nThrace, Macedonia, and Mœsia, which resulted in the destruction of the\r\nGothic fleet, and an immense booty in captives and cattle.\r\n\r\n(M1117) Claudius survived this great, but not decisive victory, but two\r\nyears, and was carried off by pestilence, at Sirmiun, A.D. 270; but not\r\nuntil he had designated for his successor a still greater man—the\r\ncelebrated Aurelian, whose father had been a peasant. Every day of his\r\nshort reign was filled with wonders. He put an end to the Gothic war,\r\nchastised the Germans who invaded Italy, recovered Gaul, Britain, and\r\nSpain, defeated the Alemanni, who devastated the empire from the Po to the\r\nDanube, destroyed the proud monarchy which Zenobia had built up in the\r\ndeserts of the East, took the queen captive, and carried her to Rome,\r\nwhere he celebrated the most magnificent triumph which the world had seen\r\nsince the days of Pompey and Cæsar. This celebrated woman, equaling\r\nCleopatra in beauty, and Boadicea in valor, and blending the popular\r\nmanners of the Roman princes with the stately pomp of Oriental kings, had\r\nretired, on her defeat, to the beautiful city which Solomon had built,\r\nshaded with palms, and ornamented with palaces. There, in that Tadmor of\r\nthe wilderness, Palmyra, the capital of her empire, which embraced a large\r\npart of Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, she had cultivated the learning of\r\nthe Greeks, and the Oriental tongues of the countries she ruled, excelling\r\nequally in the chase and in war, the most truly accomplished woman of\r\nantiquity,—sprung, like Cleopatra, from the Greek kings of Egypt. Among\r\nher counselors was the celebrated Longinus—the most conspicuous ornament\r\nof the last age of Greek classic literature, and a philosopher who taught\r\nthe wisdom of Plato. When Palmyra was taken by Aurelian, this great man,\r\nwho had stimulated Zenobia in her rebellion, was executed, without\r\nuttering a word of complaint, together with the people of the city, with\r\nremorseless barbarity, and the city of Solomon became an inconsiderable\r\nArab town. The queen, who had fled, was pursued and taken, and graced the\r\nmagnificent triumph of the martial emperor. The captive queen was made to\r\nprecede the triumphal chariot, on foot, loaded with fetters of gold, and\r\narrayed in the most gorgeous dress of her former empire. She was not\r\nexecuted, but permitted to reside in the capital in the state of princes.\r\n\r\n(M1118) This great and brilliant triumph—one of the last glories of the\r\nsetting sun of Roman greatness—seemed to augur the restoration of the\r\nempire. The emperor was sanguine, and boasted that all external danger had\r\npassed away. But in a few months he was summoned to meet new enemies in\r\nthe East, and he was murdered by a conspiracy of his officers, probably in\r\nrevenge for the cruelties and massacres he had inflicted at Rome. In one\r\nof his reforms a sedition arose, and was quelled inexorably by the\r\nslaughter of seven thousand of the soldiers, besides a large number of the\r\nleading nobles.\r\n\r\n(M1119) His sceptre descended to Tacitus, A.D. 275, a descendant of the\r\ngreat historian: a man, says Niebuhr, “who was great in every thing that\r\ncould distinguish a senator; he possessed immense property, of which he\r\nmade a brilliant use; he was a man of unblemished character; he possessed\r\nthe knowledge of a statesman, and had, in his youth, shown great military\r\nskill.” Scarcely was he inaugurated as emperor before he marched against\r\nthe Alans, a Scythian tribe, who had ravaged Pontus, Cappadocia, Cilicia,\r\nand Galatea. He, however, lost his life amid the hardships of his first\r\ncampaign, at the age of seventy-five, and after a brief reign of six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n(M1120) The veteran general, M. Aurelius Probus, the commander of the\r\nEastern provinces, was proclaimed emperor by the legions, although\r\noriginally of peasant rank. He was forty-five years of age, and united the\r\nmilitary greatness of Aurelian with political prudence, in all respects\r\nthe best choice which could have been made, and one of the best and\r\ngreatest of all the emperors. His six years of administration were marked\r\nby uninterrupted successes, and he won a fame equal to that of the ancient\r\nheroes. He restored peace and order in all the provinces; he broke the\r\npower of the Sarmatians; he secured the alliance of the Goths; he drove\r\nthe Isaurians to their strongholds among their inaccessible mountains; he\r\nchastised the rebellious cities of Egypt; he delivered Gaul from the\r\nGermanic barbarians; he drove the Franks to their morasses at the mouth of\r\nthe Rhine; he vanquished the Burgundians who had wandered in quest of\r\nbooty from the banks of the Oder; he defeated the Lygii, a fierce tribe on\r\nthe borders of Silesia; he extended his victories to the Elbe, and erected\r\na wall, two hundred miles in length, from the Danube to the Rhine; so that\r\n“there was not left,” says Gibbon, “in all the provinces, a hostile\r\nbarbarian, or tyrant, or even a robber.” After having destroyed four\r\nhundred thousand of the barbarians, he returned to his capital to\r\ncelebrate a triumph, which equaled in splendor that of Aurelian. He, too,\r\nfancied that all external enemies were subdued forever, and that Rome\r\nshould henceforth rejoice in eternal peace. But scarcely had the pæans of\r\nvictory been sung by a triumphant and infatuated people, when he was\r\nassassinated in a mutiny of his own troops, whom he had compelled to labor\r\nin draining the marshes around Sirmium, A.D. 282.\r\n\r\n(M1121) The soldiers, repenting the act as soon as it was done, conferred\r\nthe purple on the prætorian prefect, and _notified_ the Senate of its\r\nchoice. And the choice was a good one; and the new emperor, Carus, at\r\nsixty years of age, conferring the title of Cæsar upon his two sons,\r\nCarinus and Numerianus, whom he left to govern the West, hastened against\r\nthe Sarmatians, who had overrun Illyricum. Successful in his objects, he\r\nadvanced, in the depth of winter, through Thrace and Asia Minor to the\r\nconfines of Persia. The Persian king, wishing to avert the storm, sent his\r\nambassadors to the imperial camp, and found the emperor seated on the\r\ngrass, dining from peas and bacon, in all the simplicity of the early\r\nsuccessors of Mohammed. But before he could advance beyond the Tigris, his\r\ntent was struck by lightning, and he was killed, on Christmas day, A.D.\r\n283.\r\n\r\n(M1122) Carinus and Numerian succeeded to the vacant throne. The former,\r\nat Rome, disgraced his trust by indolence and shameless vices; while the\r\nlatter, in the camp, was unfit, though virtuous, to control the turbulent\r\nsoldiers, and was found murdered in his bed the very day that Carinus\r\ncelebrated the games with unusual magnificence.\r\n\r\n(M1123) The army raised C. Valerius Diocletianus to the vacant dignity,\r\nand his first act was to execute the murderer of Numerian. His next was to\r\nencounter Carinus in battle, who was slain, A.D. 285, and\r\nDiocletian—perhaps the greatest emperor after Augustus—reigned alone.\r\nDiocletian is, however, rendered infamous in ecclesiastical history, as\r\nthe most bitter of all the persecutors of the Christians, now a large and\r\ngrowing body; but he was a man of the most distinguished abilities, though\r\nof obscure birth, in a little Dalmatian town. He commenced his illustrious\r\nreign at the age of thirty-nine, and reigned twenty years,—more as a\r\nstatesman than warrior,—politic, judicious, indefatigable in business, and\r\nsteady in his purposes.\r\n\r\n(M1124) This emperor inaugurated a new era, and a new policy of\r\ngovernment. The cares of State in a disordered age, when the empire was\r\nthreatened on every side by hostile barbarians, and disgraced by\r\ninsurrections and tumults, induced Diocletian to associate with himself\r\nthree colleagues, who had won fame in the wars of Aurelian and Carus.\r\nMaximian, Galerius, and Constantine—one of whom had the dignity of\r\nAugustus, and two that of Cæsar.\r\n\r\nMaximian, associated with Diocletian, with the rank of Augustus, had been\r\nalso an Illyrian peasant, and was assigned to the government of the\r\nwestern provinces, while Diocletian retained that of the eastern. Maximum\r\nestablished the seat of his government at Milan, giving a death-blow to\r\nthe Senate, which, though still mentioned honorably by name, was\r\nhenceforth severed from the imperial court. The empire had been ruled by\r\nsoldiers ever since pressing dangers had made it apparent that only men of\r\nmartial virtues could preserve it from the barbarians. But now the most\r\nundisguised _military_ rule, uninfluenced by old constitutional form, was\r\nthe only recognized authority, and the warlike emperors, bred in the camp,\r\nhad a disdain of the ancient capital, as well as great repugnance to the\r\nenervated prætorian soldiers, who made and unmade emperors, whose\r\nprivileges were abolished forever. Milan was selected for the seat of\r\nimperial government, from its proximity to the frontier, perpetually\r\nmenaced by the barbarians; and this city, before a mere military post, now\r\nassumed the splendor of an imperial city, and was defended by a double\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n(M1125) Diocletian made choice, at first, of Nicomedia, the old capital of\r\nthe Bithynian kings, as the seat of his Eastern government, equally\r\ndistant from the Danube and the Euphrates. He assumed the manner and state\r\nof an Oriental monarch. He wore a diadem set with pearls, and a robe of\r\nsilk and gold instead of the simple toga with its purple stripe. His shoes\r\nwere studded with precious stones, and his court was marked by Oriental\r\nceremonials. His person was difficult of access, and the avenues to his\r\npalace were guarded by various classes of officers. No one could approach\r\nhim without falling prostrate in adoration, and he was addressed as “My\r\nlord the emperor.” But he did not live in Oriental seclusion, and was\r\nperpetually called away by pressing dangers.\r\n\r\n(M1126) The Cæsars Galerius and Constantius were sent to govern the\r\nprovinces on the frontiers; the former, from his capital, Sirmium, in\r\nIllyricum, watched the whole frontier of the Danube; the latter spent his\r\ntime in Britain. Galerius was adopted by Diocletian, and received his\r\ndaughter Valeria in marriage; while Constantius was adopted by Maximian,\r\nand married his daughter Theodora.\r\n\r\nThe division of the empire under these four princes nearly corresponded\r\nwith the prefectures which Constantine subsequently established, and which\r\nwere deemed necessary to preserve the empire from dissolution—a\r\ndissolution inevitable, had it not been for the great emperors whom the\r\nnecessities of the empire had raised up, but whose ruin was only for a\r\ntime averted. Not even able generals and good emperors could save the\r\ncorrupted empire. It was doomed. Vice had prepared the way for violence.\r\nThe four emperors, who now labored to prevent a catastrophe, were engaged\r\nin perpetual conflicts, and through their united efforts peace was\r\nrestored throughout the empire, and the last triumph that Rome ever saw\r\nwas celebrated by them.\r\n\r\n(M1127) Only one more enemy, to the eye of Diocletian, remained to be\r\nsubdued, and this was Christianity. But this enemy was unconquerable.\r\nSilently, surely, without pomp, and without art, the new religion had made\r\nits way, against all opposition, prejudice, and hatred, from Jews and\r\npagans alike, and was now a power in the empire. The followers of the\r\nhated sect were, however, from the humble classes, and but few great men\r\nhad arisen among them, and even these were unimportant to the view of\r\nphilosophers and rulers. The believers formed an esoteric circle, and were\r\nlofty, stern, and hostile to all the existing institutions of society.\r\nThey formed an _imperium in imperio_, but did not aim, at this time, to\r\nreach political power. They were scattered throughout the great cities of\r\nthe empire, and were ruled by their bishops and ministers. They did not\r\nmake war on men, but on their ideas and habits and customs. They avoided\r\nall external conflicts, and contended with devils and passions. But\r\ngovernment distrusted and disliked them, and sought at different times to\r\nexterminate them. There had already been nine signal persecutions from the\r\ntime of Nero, and yet they had constantly increased in numbers and\r\ninfluence. But now a more serious attack was to be made upon them by the\r\nemperors, provoked, probably, by the refusal of some Christians to take\r\nthe military oath, and serve in the armies, on conscientious principles:\r\nbut interpreted by those in authority as disloyalty in a great national\r\ncrisis. The mind of the emperor was alienated; and both Galerius and\r\nDiocletian resolved that a religion which seemed hostile to the political\r\nrelations of the empire, should be suppressed. A decree was issued to\r\ndestroy all the Christian churches, to confiscate their property, to burn\r\nthe sacred writings, to deprive Christians of their civil rights, and even\r\nto doom them to death. The decree which was publicly exhibited in\r\nNicomedia, was torn down by a Christian, who expressed the bitterest\r\ndetestation of the tyrannical governors. The fires which broke out in the\r\npalace were ascribed to the Christians, and the command was finally issued\r\nto imprison all the ministers of religion, and punish those who protected\r\nthem. A persecution which has had no parallel in history, was extended to\r\nall parts of the empire. The whole civil power, goaded by the old priests\r\nof paganism, was employed in searching out victims, and all classes of\r\nChristians were virtually tormented and murdered. The earth groaned for\r\nten years under the sad calamity, and there was apparently no hope. But\r\nwhether scourged, or lacerated, or imprisoned, or burned, the martyrs\r\nshowed patience, faith, and moral heroism, and invoked death to show its\r\nsting, and the grave its victory.\r\n\r\n(M1128) The persecution of the Christians—this attempt to suppress\r\nreligion thought to be hostile to the imperial authority, and not without\r\nsome plausibility, since many Christians refused to be enrolled in the\r\narmies, and suffered death sooner than enlist—was the last great act of\r\nDiocletian. Whether wearied with the cares of State, or disgusted with his\r\nduties, or ill, or craving rest and repose, he took the extraordinary\r\nresolution of abdicating his throne, at the very summit of his power, and\r\nat the age of fifty-nine. He influenced Maximian to do the same, and the\r\ntwo Augusti gave place to the two Cæsars. The double act of resignation\r\nwas performed at Nicomedia and Milan, on the same day, May 1, A.D. 305.\r\nDiocletian took a graceful farewell of his soldiers, and withdrew to a\r\nretreat near his native city of Salonæ, on the coast of the Adriatic. He\r\nwithdrew to a magnificent palace, which he had built on a square of six\r\nhundred feet, in a lovely and fertile spot, in sight of the sea, and the\r\nmountains, and luxurious plains. He there devoted himself to the pleasures\r\nof agriculture, and planted cabbages with his own hand, and refused all\r\nsolicitations to resume his power. But his repose was alloyed by the sight\r\nof increasing troubles, and the failure of the system he had inaugurated.\r\nIf the empire could not be governed by one master, it could not be\r\ngoverned by four, with their different policies and rivalries. He lived\r\nbut nine years in retirement; but long enough to see his religious policy\r\nreversed, by the edict of Milan, which confirmed the Christian religion,\r\nand the whole imperial fabric which he had framed reversed by Constantine.\r\n\r\n(M1129) Confusion followed his abdication. Civil wars instead of barbaric\r\nwasted the empire. The ancient heart of the empire had no longer the\r\npresence of an Augustus, and a new partition virtually took place, by\r\nwhich Italy and Africa became dependencies of the East. Galerius—now\r\nAugustus—assumed the right to nominate the two new Cæsars, one of whom was\r\nhis sister’s son, who assumed the name of Galerius Valerius Maximinus, to\r\nwhom were assigned Syria and Egypt, and the other was his faithful\r\nservant, Severus, who was placed over Italy and Africa. According to the\r\nforms of the constitution, he was subordinate to Constantius, but he was\r\ndevoted to Galerius. The emperor Constantius, then in Boulogne, was dying,\r\nand his son, Constantine, was at the court of Galerius. Though summoned to\r\nthe bedside of his father, Galerius sought to retain him, but Constantine\r\nabruptly left Nicomedia, evaded Severus, traversed Europe, and reached his\r\nfather, who was just setting out for Britain, to repel an invasion of the\r\nCaledonians. He reached York only to die, A.D. 306, and with his last\r\nbreath transmitted his empire to his son, and commended him to the\r\nsoldiers. Galerius was transported with rage, but was compelled to submit,\r\nand named Constantine Cæsar over the western provinces, who was not\r\nelevated to the dignity of Augustus till two years later.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Severus to supreme power in Italy by Galerius, filled the\r\nabdicated emperor Maximian with indignation, and humiliated the Roman\r\npeople. The prætorians rose against the party of Severus, who retired to\r\nRavenna, and soon after committed suicide. The Senate assumed their old\r\nprerogative, and conferred the purple on Maxentius, the son of Maximilian.\r\nGalerius again assumed the power of nominating an Augustus, and bestowed\r\nthe purple, made vacant by the death of Severus, on an old comrade,\r\nLicinius, originally a Dacian peasant.\r\n\r\n(M1130) Thus, there were six emperors at a time; Constantine, in Britain;\r\nMaximian, who resumed the purple; Maxentius, his son; Licinius Galerius,\r\nin the East; and Maximin, his nephew. Maximian crossed the Alps in person,\r\nwon over Constantine to his party, and gave him his daughter, Fausta, in\r\nmarriage, and conferred upon him the rank of Augustus; so, in the West,\r\nMaxentius and Constantine affected to be subordinate to Maximian; while,\r\nin the East, Licinius and Maximin obeyed the orders of their benefactor,\r\nGalerius. The sovereigns of the East and West were hostile to each other,\r\nbut their mutual fears produced an apparent tranquillity, and a feigned\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\n(M1131) The first actual warfare, however, broke out between Maximian and\r\nhis son. Maxentius insisted on the renewed abdication of his father, and\r\nhad the support of the prætorian guards. Driven into exile, he returned to\r\nGaul, and took refuge with his son and daughter, who received him kindly;\r\nbut in the absence of Constantine, he seized the treasure to bribe his\r\ntroops, and was holding communication with Maxentius when Constantine\r\nreturned from the Rhine. The old intriguer had only time to throw himself\r\ninto Marseilles, where he strangled himself, when the city was hard\r\npressed by Constantine, A.D. 310.\r\n\r\n(M1132) In a year after, Galerius died, like Herod Agrippa, a prey to\r\nloathsome vermin—morbus pediculosus, and his dominions were divided\r\nbetween Maximin and Licinius, each of whom formed secret alliances with\r\nMaxentius and Constantine, between whom was war.\r\n\r\n(M1133) The tyranny of Maxentius led his subjects to look to Constantine\r\nas a deliverer, who marched to the relief of the Senate and Roman people.\r\nHe crossed the Alps with forty thousand men. Maxentius collected a force\r\nof one hundred and seventy thousand, to maintain which he had the wealth\r\nof Italy, Africa, and Sicily. Constantine first encountered the\r\nlieutenants of Maxentius in the plains of Turin, and gained a complete\r\nvictory, the prize of which was Milan, the new capital of Italy. He was\r\nadvancing to Rome on the Flaminian way, before Maxentius was aroused to\r\nhis danger, being absorbed in pleasures. A few miles from Rome was fought\r\nthe battle of Saxa Rubra, A.D. 312, between the rival emperors, at which\r\nMaxentius perished, and Constantine was greeted by the Senate as the first\r\nof the three surviving Augusti. The victory of Constantine was\r\ncommemorated by a triumphal arch, which still remains, and which was only\r\na copy of the arch of Trajan. The ensuing winter was spent in Rome, during\r\nwhich Constantine abolished forever the prætorian guards, which had given\r\nso many emperors to the world. In the spring Constantine gave his daughter\r\nConstantia in marriage to Licinius, but was soon called away to the Rhine\r\nby an irruption of Franks, while Licinius marched against Maximin, and\r\ndefeated him under the walls of Heracles. Maximin retreated to Nicomedia,\r\nand was about to renew the war, when he died at Tarsus, and Licinius\r\nbecame master of the Eastern provinces.\r\n\r\n(M1134) There were now but two emperors, one in the East, and the other in\r\nthe West. Constantine celebrated the restoration of tranquillity by\r\npromulgating at Milan an edict in favor of universal religious toleration,\r\nand the persecution of the Christians by the pagans was ended forever, in\r\nEurope. About this time Constantine himself was converted to the new\r\nreligion. In his march against Maxentius, it is declared by Eusebius, that\r\nhe saw at noonday a cross in the heavens, inscribed with the words, “By\r\nthis conquer.” It is also asserted that the vision of the cross was seen\r\nby the whole army, and the cross henceforth became the standard of the\r\nChristian emperors. It was called the _Labarum_, and is still seen on the\r\ncoins of Constantine, and was intrusted to a chosen guard of fifty men. It\r\nundoubtedly excited enthusiasm in the army, now inclined to accept the new\r\nfaith, and Constantine himself joined the progressive party, and made\r\nChristianity the established religion of the empire. Henceforth the\r\nprotection of the Christian religion became one of the cherished objects\r\nof his soul, and although his life was stained by superstitions and many\r\nacts of cruelty and wickedness, Constantine stands out in history as the\r\nfirst Christian emperor. For this chiefly he is famous, and a favorite\r\nwith ecclesiastical writers. The edict of Milan is an era in the world’s\r\nprogress. But he was also a great sovereign, and a great general.\r\n\r\n(M1135) The harmony between so ambitious a man and Licinius was not of\r\nlong duration. Rival interests and different sympathies soon led to the\r\nbreaking out of hostilities, and Licinius was defeated in two great\r\nbattles, and resigned to Constantine all his European possessions, except\r\nThrace. The nine successive years were spent by Licinius in slothful and\r\nvicious pleasures, while Constantine devoted his energies to the\r\nsuppression of barbarians, and the enactment of important laws. He\r\nrepulsed the Gothic and Sarmatian hordes, who had again crossed the\r\nDanube, and pursued them into Dacia; nor did the Goths secure peace until\r\nthey had furnished forty thousand recruits to the Roman armies. This\r\nrecruiting of the imperial armies from the barbarians was one of the most\r\nmelancholy signs of decaying strength, and indicated approaching ruin.\r\n\r\n(M1136) In the year 323 a new civil war broke out between Constantine and\r\nLicinius. The aged and slothful Eastern emperor roused himself to a grand\r\neffort and marshalled an army of one hundred and fifty thousand foot and\r\nfifteen thousand horse on the plains of Hadrianople, while his fleet of\r\nthree hundred and fifty triremes commanded the Hellespont. Constantine\r\ncollected an army of one hundred and twenty thousand men at Thessalonica,\r\nand advanced to attack his foe, intrenched in a strong position. The\r\nbattle was decided in favor of Constantine, who slew thirty-four thousand\r\nof his enemies, and took the fortified camp of Licinius, who fled to\r\nByzantium, July, A.D. 323.\r\n\r\n(M1137) The fleet of Licinius still remained, and with his superior naval\r\nforce he might have baffled his rival. But fortune, or valor, again\r\ndecided in favor of the Western emperor, and after a fight of two days the\r\nadmiral of Licinius retired to Byzantium. The siege of this city was now\r\npressed with valor by Constantine, and Licinius fled with his treasures to\r\nChalcedon, and succeeded in raising another army of fifty thousand men.\r\nThese raw levies were, however, powerless against the veterans of\r\nConstantine, whom he led in person. The decisive battle was fought at\r\nChrysopolis, and Licinius retired to Nicomedia, but soon after abdicated,\r\nand was banished to Thessalonica. There he was not long permitted to\r\nremain, being executed by order of Constantine, one of the foul blots on\r\nhis memory and character.\r\n\r\n(M1138) The empire was now reunited under a single man, at the cost of\r\nvast treasures and lives. The policy of Diocletian had only inaugurated\r\ncivil war. There is no empire so vast which can not be more easily\r\ngoverned by one man than by two or four. It may be well for empires to be\r\nsubdivided, like that of Charlemagne, but it is impossible to prevent\r\ncivil wars when the power is shared equally by jealous rivals. It was\r\nbetter for the Roman world to be united under Octavius, than divided\r\nbetween him and Antony.\r\n\r\n(M1139) On the fall of Byzantium, Constantine was so struck with its\r\nnatural advantages, that he resolved to make it the capital of the empire.\r\nPlaced on the inner of two straits which connect the Euxine and the Ægean\r\nwith the Mediterranean, on the frontiers of both Europe and Asia, it\r\nseemed to be the true centre of political power, while its position could\r\nbe itself rendered impregnable against any external enemy that threatened\r\nthe Roman world. The wisdom of the choice of Constantine, and his\r\nunrivaled sagacity, were proved by the fact, that while Rome was\r\nsuccessively taken and sacked by Goths and Vandals, Constantinople\r\nremained the capital of the eastern Roman empire for eleven continuous\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n(M1140) The reign of Constantine as sole emperor was marked by another\r\nevent, A.D. 325. which had a great influence on the subsequent condition\r\nof the world in a moral and religious point of view, and this was the\r\nfamous Council of Nicæa, which assembled to settle points of faith and\r\ndiscipline in the new religion which was now established throughout the\r\nempire. It is called the first Ecumenical, or General Council, and was\r\nattended by three hundred and eighteen bishops, with double the number of\r\npresbyters, assembled from all parts of the Christian world. Here the\r\nchurch and the empire met face to face. In this council the emperor left\r\nthe cares of State, and the command of armies, to preside over discussions\r\non the doctrine of the Trinity, as expounded by two great rival\r\nparties,—one headed by Athanasius, then archdeacon, afterward archbishop\r\nof Alexandria—the greatest theologian that had as yet appeared in the\r\nchurch,—and the other by Arius, a simple presbyter of Alexandria, but a\r\nman of subtle and commanding intellect. Arius maintained that the Son, the\r\nsecond person of the Trinity, derived his being from the Father within the\r\nlimits of time, and was secondary to him in power and glory. Athanasius\r\nmaintained that the Son was co-eternal with the Father, and the same in\r\nsubstance with the Father. This theological question had long been\r\ndiscussed, and the church was divided between the two parties, each of\r\nwhich exhibited extreme acrimony. Constantine leaned to the orthodox side,\r\nalthough his most influential adviser, Eusebius, bishop of Cæsarea, the\r\nhistorian, inclined to the Arian view. But the emperor was more desirous\r\nto secure peace and unity, than the ascendency of any dogma, and the\r\ndoctrine of Athanasius became the standard of faith, and has since\r\nremained the creed of the church.\r\n\r\n(M1141) After the settlement of the faith of the church, now becoming the\r\ngreat power of the world, the reign of Constantine was disgraced by a\r\ndomestic tragedy seldom paralleled in history. His son, Crispus, by a\r\nlow-born woman, conspicuous for talents and virtues, either inflamed the\r\njealousy of his father, or provoked him by a secret conspiracy. It has\r\nnever been satisfactorily settled whether he was a rival or a conspirator,\r\nbut he was accused, tried, and put to death, in the twentieth year of the\r\nreign, while Constantine was celebrating at Rome the festival of his\r\n_vicennalia_. After this bloody tragedy, for which he is generally\r\nreproached, he took his final departure from Rome, and four years after,\r\nthe old capital was degraded to the rank of a secondary city, and\r\nConstantinople was dedicated as the new capitol of the empire. From the\r\neastern promontory to the Golden Horn, the extreme length of\r\nConstantinople was three Roman miles, and the circumference measured ten,\r\ninclosing an area of two thousand acres, besides the suburbs. The new city\r\nwas divided into fourteen wards, and was ornamented with palaces, fora,\r\nand churches. The church of St. Sophia was built on the site of an old\r\ntemple, and was in the form of a Greek cross, surmounted by a beautiful\r\nand lofty dome. In a century afterward, Constantinople rivaled Rome in\r\nmagnificence. It had a capitol, a circus, two theatres, eight public\r\nbaths, fifty-two porticoes, eight aqueducts, four halls, and fourteen\r\nchurches, and four thousand three hundred and eighty-three large palatial\r\nresidences.\r\n\r\n(M1142) After the building of this new and beautiful city, Constantine\r\ndevoted himself to the internal regulation of the empire, which he divided\r\ninto four prefectures, subdivided into thirteen dioceses, each governed by\r\nvicars or vice-prefects, who were styled counts and dukes. The provinces\r\nwere subdivided to the number of one hundred and sixteen. Three of these\r\nwere governed by proconsuls, thirty-seven by consuls, five by correctors,\r\nand seventy-one by presidents, chosen from the legal profession, and\r\ncalled _clarissimi_. The prefecture of the East embraced the Asiatic\r\nprovinces, together with Egypt, Thrace, and the lower Mœsia; that of\r\nIllyricum contained the countries between the Danube, the Ægean, and the\r\nAdriatic; that of Italy extended over the Alps to the Danube; and that of\r\nthe Gauls embraced the western provinces beyond the Rhine and the Alps.\r\n\r\n(M1143) The military power was separated from the civil. There were two\r\nmaster-generals, one of infantry, and the other of cavalry, afterward\r\nincreased to eight, under whom were thirty-five commanders, ten of whom\r\nwere counts, and twenty dukes. The legions were reduced from six thousand\r\nto fifteen hundred men. Their number was one hundred and thirty-two, and\r\nthe complete force of the empire was six hundred and forty-five thousand,\r\nholding five hundred and eighty-three permanent stations.\r\n\r\n(M1144) The ministers of the palace, who exercised different functions\r\nabout the presence of the emperor, were seven in number: the prefect of\r\nthe bed-chamber; a eunuch, who waited on the emperor; the master of\r\noffices—the supreme magistrate of the palace; the quæstor—at the head of\r\nthe judicial administration, and who composed the orations and edicts of\r\nthe emperor; the treasurer, and two counts of domestics, who commanded the\r\nbody-guard.\r\n\r\n(M1145) The bishopric nearly corresponded with the civil divisions of the\r\nempire, and the bishops had different ranks. We now observe archbishops\r\nand metropolitans.\r\n\r\nThe new divisions complicated the machinery of government, and led to the\r\ninstitution of many new offices, which greatly added to the expense of\r\ngovernment, for which taxation became more rigorous and oppressive. The\r\nold constitution was completely subverted, and the emperor became an\r\nOriental monarch.\r\n\r\n(M1146) Constantine was called away from his labors of organization to\r\nresist the ambition of Sapor II., when he died, at the age of sixty-four,\r\nat his palace near Nicomedia, A.D. 337, after a memorable but tumultuous\r\nreign—memorable for the recognition of Christianity as a State religion;\r\ntumultuous, from civil wars and contests with barbarians. Constantinople,\r\nnot Rome, became the future capital of the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF THE EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Constantine, the decline was rapid, and new dangers\r\nmultiplied. Warlike emperors had staved off the barbarians, and done all\r\nthat man could do to avert ruin. But the seeds of ruin were planted, and\r\nmust bear their wretched fruit. The seat of empire was removed to a new\r\ncity, more able, from its position, to withstand the shock which was to\r\ncome. In the strife between new and hardy races, and the old corrupt\r\npopulation, the issue could not be doubtful. The empire had fulfilled its\r\nmission. Christianity was born, protected, and rendered triumphant.\r\nNothing more was wanted than the conversion of the barbarians to the new\r\nfaith before desolation should overspread the world—and a State prepared\r\nfor new ideas, passions, and interests.\r\n\r\n(M1147) Constantine left three sons and two daughters, by Fausta, the\r\ndaughter of Maximian,—Constantine, Constantius, Constans, Constantina, and\r\nHelena. The imperial dignity was enjoyed by the sons, and the youngest\r\ndaughter, Helena, married the emperor Julian, grandson of Constantius\r\nChlorus. The three sons of Constantine divided the empire between them.\r\nThe oldest, at the age of twenty-one, retained the prefecture of Gaul;\r\nConstantius, aged twenty, kept Thrace and the East; while Constans, the\r\nyoungest, at the age of seventeen, added the Italian prefecture with\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n(M1148) The ablest of these princes was Constantius, on whom fell the\r\nburden of the Persian war, and which ultimately ended on the defeat of\r\nJulian, in Sapor wresting from the emperor all the countries beyond the\r\nEuphrates.\r\n\r\nConstantine II. was dissatisfied with his share of the empire, and\r\ncompelled Constans to yield up Africa, but was slain in an expedition\r\nbeyond the Julian Alps, A.D. 340.\r\n\r\n(M1149) Constans held the empire of the West for ten years, during which\r\nhe carried on war with the Franks, upon the Rhine, and with the Scots and\r\nPicts. His vices were so disgraceful that a rebellion took place, under\r\nMagnentius, who slew Constans, A.D. 350, and reigned in his stead, the\r\nseat of his government being Treves.\r\n\r\n(M1150) Constantius II. made war on the usurper, Magnentius, a rough\r\nbarbarian, and finally defeated him on the banks of the Danube, where\r\nfifty-four thousand men perished in battle, soon after which the usurper\r\nkilled himself.\r\n\r\n(M1151) Constantius, by the death of his brother, and overthrow of\r\nMagnentius, was now sole master of the empire, and through his permission\r\nAthanasius was restored to the arch-bishopric of Alexandria, but was again\r\nremoved, the emperor being an Arian. This second removal raised a tumult\r\nin Alexandria, and he was allowed to return to his see, where he lived in\r\npeace until he died, A.D. 372—the great defender of the orthodox creed,\r\nwhich finally was established by councils and the emperors.\r\n\r\n(M1152) The emperor Constantius was engaged in successive wars with the\r\nbarbarians,—with the Persians on the East, the Sarmatians on the Danube,\r\nand the Franks and Alemanni, on the Rhine. During these wars, his\r\nbrother-in-law, Julian, was sent to the West with the title of Cæsar,\r\nwhere he restored order, and showed signal ability. On the death of\r\nConstantius, he was recognized as emperor without opposition, A.D. 361.\r\n\r\n(M1153) Julian is generally called the Apostate, since he proclaimed a\r\nchange in the established religion, but tolerated Christianity. He was a\r\nPlatonic philosopher—a man of great virtue and ability, whose life was\r\nunstained by vices. But his attempt to restore paganism was senseless and\r\nineffectual. As a popular belief, paganism had expired. His character is\r\nwarmly praised by Gibbon, and commended by other historians. He struggled\r\nagainst the spirit of his age, and was unsuccessful. He was worthy of the\r\nbest ages of the empire in the exercise of all pagan virtues—the true\r\nsuccessor of Hadrian and the Antonines.\r\n\r\n(M1154) He was also a great general, and sought to crush the power of the\r\nPersian kings and make Babylonia a Roman province. Here, too, he failed,\r\nalthough he gained signal successes. He was mortally wounded while\r\neffecting a retreat from the Tigris, after a short reign of twenty months.\r\nWith him ended the house of Constantine. The empire was conferred by the\r\ntroops on Flavius Claudius Jovianus, chief of the imperial household, A.D.\r\n363—a man of moderate talents and good intentions, but unfit for such\r\nstormy times. He restored Christianity, which henceforth was the national\r\nreligion. He died the following year, and was succeeded by Flavius\r\nValentinianus, the son of Count Gratian, a general who had arisen from\r\nobscurity in Pannonia, to the command of Africa and Britain.\r\n\r\n(M1155) Valentinian was forty-four years of age when he began to reign,\r\nA.D. 364, a man of noble character and person, and in a month associated\r\nhis brother Flavius Valens with him in the government of the empire.\r\nValentinian kept the West, and conferred the East on Valens. Thus was the\r\nempire again formally divided, and was not reunited until the reign of\r\nTheodosius. Valentinian chose the post of danger, rather than of pleasure\r\nand luxury, for the West was now invaded by various tribes of the Germanic\r\nrace. The Alemanni were powerful on the Rhine; the Saxons were invading\r\nBritain; the Burgundians were commencing their ravages in Gaul; and the\r\nGoths were preparing for another inroad. The emperor, whose seat of power\r\nwas Milan, was engaged in perpetual, but indecisive conflicts. He reigned\r\nwith vigor, and repressed the barbarians. He bestowed the title of\r\nAugustus on his son Gratian, and died in a storm of wrath by the bursting\r\nof a blood-vessel, while reviling the ambassadors of the Quadi, A.D. 375.\r\n\r\n(M1156) The emperor Valens, at Constantinople, was exposed to no less\r\ndangers, without the force to meet them. The great nation of the Goths,\r\nwho had been at peace with the empire for a generation, resumed their\r\nhostilities upon the Danube. Hermanneric, the first historic name among\r\nthese fierce people, had won a series of brilliant victories over other\r\nbarbarians, after he was eighty years of age. His dominions extended from\r\nthe Danube to the Baltic, and embraced the greater part of Germany and\r\nScythia.\r\n\r\n(M1157) But the Goths were invaded by a fierce race of barbarians, more\r\nsavage than themselves, from the banks of the Don, called Scythians, or\r\nHuns, of Sclavonic origin. Pressed by this new enemy, they sought shelter\r\nin the Roman territory. Instead of receiving them as allies, the emperor\r\ntreated them as enemies. Hostages from the flower of their youth were\r\nscattered through the cities of Asia Minor, while the corrupt governors of\r\nThrace annoyed them by insults and grievances. The aged Hermanneric,\r\nexasperated by misfortune, made preparations for a general war, while\r\nSarmatians, Alans, and Huns united with them. After three indecisive\r\ncampaigns, the emperor Valens advanced to attack their camp near\r\nHadrianople, defended by Fritagern. Under the walls of this city was\r\nfought the most bloody and disastrous battle which Rome ever lost, A.D.\r\n378. Two-thirds of the imperial army was destroyed, the emperor was slain,\r\nand the remainder fled in consternation. Sixty thousand infantry and six\r\nthousand cavalry lay dead upon the fatal field. The victors, intoxicated\r\nwith their success, invested Hadrianople, but were unequal to the task,\r\nbeing inexperienced in sieges. Laden with spoil, they retired to the\r\nwestern boundaries of Thrace. From the shores of the Bosphorus to the\r\nJulian Alps, nothing was seen but conflagration, murder, and devastation.\r\nSo great were the misfortunes of the Illyrian provinces, that they never\r\nafterward recovered. Churches were turned into stables, palaces were\r\nburned, works of art were destroyed, the relics of martyrs were\r\ndesecrated, the population decimated, and the provinces were overrun.\r\n\r\n(M1158) In this day of calamity a hero and deliverer was needed. The\r\nfeeble Gratian, who ruled in the West, cast his eyes upon an exile, whose\r\nfather, an eminent general, had been unjustly murdered by the emperor\r\nValentinian. This man was Theodosius, then living in modest retirement on\r\nhis farm near Valladolid, in Spain, as unambitious as David among his\r\nsheep, as contented as Cincinnatus at the plow. Even Gibbon does not sneer\r\nat this great Christian emperor, who revived for a while the falling\r\nempire. He accepted the sceptre of Valens, A.D. 370, and the conduct of\r\nthe Gothic war, being but thirty-three years of age. One of the greatest\r\nof all the emperors, and the last great man who swayed the sceptre of\r\nTrajan, his ancestor, he has not too warmly been praised by the Church,\r\nwhose defender he was—the last flickering light of an expiring\r\nmonarchy,—although his character has been assailed by modern critics of\r\ngreat respectability.\r\n\r\n(M1159) As soon as he was invested with the purple, he took up his\r\nresidence in Thessalonica, and devoted his energies to the task assigned\r\nhim by the necessities of the empire. He succeeded in putting a stop to\r\nthe progress of the Goths, disarmed them by treaties, and allowed them to\r\nsettle on the right bank of the Danube, within the limits of the empire.\r\nHe invited the aged Athanaric to his capital and table, who was astonished\r\nby his riches and glory. Peace was favored by the death of Fritagern, and\r\nforty thousand Goths were received as soldiers of the empire,—an impolitic\r\nact.\r\n\r\n(M1160) At this period the Goths settled in Mœsia were visited by Uphilas,\r\na Christian missionary and Arian bishop, who translated the Bible, and had\r\ngreat success in the conversion of the barbarians to a nominal faith. This\r\nis the earliest instance of the reception of the new faith by the Germanic\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n(M1161) While Theodosius was restoring the eastern empire, Gratian\r\nrelapsed into indolent pleasures at Milan, which provoked a revolution.\r\nMaximus was proclaimed emperor by the legions in Britain, and invaded\r\nGaul. Gratian fled, with a retinue of three hundred horse, and was\r\novertaken and slain. Theodosius recognized the claims of the usurper,\r\nunwilling to waste the blood of the enfeebled soldiers in a new civil war,\r\nprovided that Italy and Africa were secured to Valentinian II., the\r\nyounger brother of Gratian. The young emperor made himself unpopular by\r\nespousing Arianism, and for being governed by his mother Justina, and four\r\nyears after was obliged to flee to Thessalonica, on an invasion of Italy\r\nby Maximus, and invoke the aid of Theodosius, who responded to his call,\r\nwon by the charms of the princess Galla, whom he married. Maximus was\r\ndefeated, put to death, and Valentinian II. was replaced upon his throne.\r\n\r\n(M1162) It was when Maximus was triumphant in Gaul that the celebrated\r\nAmbrose, archbishop of Milan, was sent to the usurper’s camp to demand the\r\ndead body of the murdered Gratian. But this intrepid prelate made himself\r\nstill more famous for his defense of orthodoxy against the whole power of\r\nValentinian II. and his mother. He is also immortalized for the\r\nchastisement he inflicted upon Theodosius himself for the slaughter of\r\nThessalonica. The emperor was in Milan when intelligence arrived of a\r\nsedition in the city, caused by factions of the circus, during which\r\nBoderic, the commander of the imperial troops, was killed. This outrage\r\nwas revenged by the wanton massacre of seven thousand people. The news of\r\nthis barbarity filled Ambrose with horror, and he wrote a letter to the\r\nemperor, which led to his repentance; but as he was about to enter the\r\nbasilica, the prelate met him at the door, and refused admission until he\r\nhad expiated his crime by a rigorous penance, and the emperor submitted to\r\nthe humiliation—an act of submission to the Church which was much\r\nadmired—an act of ecclesiastical authority which formed a precedent for\r\nthe heroism of Hildebrand.\r\n\r\n(M1163) Under the influence of the clergy, now a great power, Theodosius\r\nthe same year promulgated an edict for the suppression of all acts of\r\npagan worship, private and public, under heavy penalties, and the Church,\r\nin turn, became persecuting. At this lime the corruption of the Church\r\nmade rapid progress. Pretended miracles, pious frauds, the worship of\r\nsaints, veneration of relics, ascetic severities, monastic superstitions,\r\nthe pomp of bishops, and a secular spirit marked the triumph of\r\nChristianity over paganism. The Church was united to the State, and the\r\nprofession of the new faith was made a necessary qualification for the\r\nenjoyment of civil rights. But the Church was now distinguished for great\r\nmen, who held high rank, theologians, and bishops, like Augustine,\r\nAmbrose, Chrysostom, Gregory, Nazianzin, Basil, Eusebius, and Martin of\r\nTours.\r\n\r\n(M1164) Theodosius died in Milan, in the arms of Ambrose, A.D. 395, and\r\nwith him the genius of Rome expired, and the real drama of the fall of the\r\nempire began. He was succeeded by his two sons, Arcadius and Honorius, the\r\none in the East and the other in the West, the former being under the\r\ntutelage of Rufinus, the latter under the care of Stilicho, master-general\r\nof the armies. Both emperors were unworthy or unequal to maintain their\r\ninheritances. The barbarians gained fresh courage from the death of\r\nTheodosius, and recommenced their ravages. The soldiers of the empire were\r\ndispirited and enervated, and threw away their defensive armor. They even\r\nwere not able to bear the weight of the cuirass and helmet, and the heavy\r\nweapons of their ancestors were exchanged for the bow. Thus they were\r\nexposed to the deadly missiles of their enemies, and fled upon the\r\napproach of danger. Gainas the Goth, who commanded the legions, slew\r\nRufinus in the presence of Arcadius, who abandoned himself at\r\nConstantinople to the influence of the eunuch Eutropius, most celebrated\r\nfor introducing Chrysostom to the court. The eunuch minister soon after\r\nwas murdered in a tumult, and Arcadius was then governed by his wife\r\nEudoxia, who secured the banishment of Chrysostom.\r\n\r\n(M1165) The empire was now finally divided. A long succession of feeble\r\nprinces reigned in the East, ruled by favorites and women, at whose courts\r\nthe manners and customs of Oriental kings were introduced. The Eastern\r\nempire now assumes the character of an Eastern monarchy, and henceforth\r\ngoes by the name of the Greek empire, at first, embracing those countries\r\nbounded by the Adriatic and Tigris, but gradually narrowed to the\r\nprecincts of Constantinople. It lasted for one thousand years longer,\r\nbefore it was finally subdued by the Turks. The history of the Greek\r\nempire properly belongs to the mediæval ages. It is our object to trace\r\nthe final fall of the Western empire.\r\n\r\n(M1166) Under Honorius, the Visigoths, ruled by Alaric, appear in history\r\nas a great and warlike people. Stilicho, the general of Honorius,\r\nencountered them unsuccessfully in two campaigns, in Macedonia and\r\nThessaly, and the degenerate cities of Greece purchased their preservation\r\nat an enormous ransom. In the year 402, Alaric crossed the Alps, and\r\nHonorius fled to the marshes of Ravenna, where, protected by the shallow\r\nsea, the Western emperors a long time resided. Stilicho gained, however, a\r\ngreat victory over the Goths at Pollentia, near Turin, and arrested the\r\nmarch of Alaric upon Rome. The defeated Goth rose, however, superior to\r\nthis defeat, celebrated by the poet Claudian, as the greatest victory\r\nwhich Rome had ever achieved. He escaped with the main body of his\r\ncavalry, broke through the passes of the Apennines, spread devastation on\r\nthe fruitful fields of Tuscany, resolved to risk another battle for the\r\ngreat prize he aimed to secure, even imperial Rome. But Stilicho purchased\r\nthe retreat of the Goths by a present of forty thousand pounds of gold.\r\nThe departure of Alaric from Italy, which he had ravaged, was regarded by\r\nthe Roman people as a complete and final deliverance, and they abandoned\r\nthemselves to absurd rejoicings and gladiatoral shows.\r\n\r\n(M1167) But scarcely was Italy delivered from the Goths before an\r\nirruption of Vandals, Suevi, and Burgundians, under the command of\r\nRodogast, or Rhadagast, two hundred thousand in number, issued from the\r\ncoast of the Baltic, crossed the Vistula, the Alps, and the Apennines,\r\nravaged the northern cities of Italy, and laid siege to Florence. The\r\nvictor of Pollentia appeared for the rescue with the last army which the\r\nempire could raise, surrounded the enemy with strong intrenchments, and\r\nforced them to retire. Stilicho again delivered Italy, but one hundred\r\nthousand barbarians remained in arms between the Alps and the Apennines,\r\nwho crossed into Gaul, then the most cultivated of the Western provinces,\r\nand completely devastated its fields, and villas, and cities. Mentz was\r\ndestroyed; Worms fell, after an obstinate siege; Strasburg, Spires,\r\nRheims, Tournay, Arras, and Amiens, all fell under the German yoke, and\r\nGaul was finally separated from the empire. The Vandals, Sueves, and\r\nAlans, passed into Spain, while the Burgundians remained behind, masters\r\nof the mountainous regions of Eastern Gaul, to which was given the name of\r\nBurgundy, A.D. 409.\r\n\r\nThe troubles of the empire led to the final withdrawal of the legions from\r\nBritain about the time that Gaul was lost, and about forty years before\r\nthe conquest of the island by the Saxons.\r\n\r\nItaly, for a time delivered, forgot the services of Stilicho, the only man\r\ncapable of defending her. The jealousy of the timid emperor he served, and\r\nthe frivolous Senate which he saved, removed for ever the last hope of\r\nRome. This able general was assassinated at Ravenna, A.D. 408.\r\n\r\n(M1168) The Gothic king, in his distant camp, beheld with joy the\r\nintrigues and factions which deprived the emperor of his best and last\r\ndefender, and prepared for a new invasion of Italy. He descended like an\r\navalanche upon the plains of Italy, and captured the cities of Aquileia,\r\nConcordia, and Cremona. He then ravaged the coasts of the Adriatic, and\r\nfollowing the Flaminian way, crossed the Appennines, devastated Umbria,\r\nand reached, without obstruction, the city which for six hundred years had\r\nnot seen a foreign enemy at her gates. Rome still contained within her\r\nwalls, twenty-three miles in circuit, a vast population, but she had no\r\nwarriors. She could boast of a long line of senatorial families, one\r\nthousand seven hundred and eighty palaces, and two million of people,\r\ntogether with the spoil of the ancient world, immense riches, and\r\ninnumerable works of art; but where were her defenders? It is a sad proof\r\nof the degeneracy of the people that they were incapable of defense.\r\n\r\n(M1169) Alaric made no effort to storm the city, but quietly sat down, and\r\ninclosed the wretched inhabitants with a cordon through which nothing\r\ncould force its way. He cut off all communication with the country and the\r\nsea, and commanded the gates. Famine, added to pestilence, did the work of\r\nsoldiers. Despair seized the haughty and effeminate citizens, who invoked\r\nthe clemency of the barbarians. He derided the ambassadors, and insulted\r\nthem with rude and sarcastic jokes. “The thicker the hay, the easier it is\r\nmowed,” replied he, when warned not to drive the people to despair. He\r\ncondescended to spare the lives of the people on condition that they gave\r\nup _all_ their gold and silver, _all_ their precious movables, and _all_\r\ntheir slaves of barbaric birth. More moderate terms were afterward\r\ngranted, but the victor did not retreat until he had loaded his wagons\r\nwith precious spoil. He retired to the fertile fields of Tuscany, to make\r\nnegotiations with Honorius, intrenched at Ravenna; and it was only on the\r\ncondition of being appointed master-general of the imperial army, with an\r\nannual subsidy of corn and money, the free possession of Dalmatia,\r\nNoricum, and Venetia, that he consented to peace with the emperor. These\r\nterms were disregarded, and the indignant barbarian once again turned his\r\nface to the city he had spared. He took possession of Ostia, and Rome was\r\nat his mercy, since her magazines were in his hands. Again the Senate,\r\nfearful of famine, consented to the demands of the conqueror. He nominated\r\nAtticus, prefect of the city, as emperor, and from him received the\r\ncommission of master-general of the armies of the West.\r\n\r\n(M1170) Atticus, after a brief reign, was degraded, and negotiations were\r\nopened with Honorius. Repelled by fresh insults, which can not be\r\ncomprehended other than from that infatuation which is sent upon the\r\ndoomed, Alaric, vindictive and indignant, once more set out for Rome,\r\nresolved on plunder and revenge. In vain did the nobles organize a\r\ndefense. Cowardice or treachery opened the Salarian gate. In the dead of\r\nnight the Goths entered the city, which now was the prey of soldiers. For\r\nfive days and five nights the “Eternal City” was exposed to every\r\nbarbarity and license, and only the treasures accumulated and deposited in\r\nthe churches of St. Paul and St. Peter were saved. A cruel slaughter of\r\nthe citizens added to the miseries of a sack. Forty thousand slaves were\r\nlet loose upon the people. The matrons and women of Rome were exposed to\r\nevery indignity. The city was given up to pillage. The daughters and wives\r\nof senatorial families were made slaves. Italian fugitives thronged the\r\nshores of Africa and Syria, begging daily bread. The whole world was\r\nfilled with consternation. The news of the capture of Rome made the tongue\r\nof St. Jerome cleave to the roof of his mouth, in his cell at Bethlehem.\r\nSorrow, misery, desolation, and despair, were everywhere. The end of the\r\nworld was supposed to be at hand, and the great churchmen of the age found\r\nconsolation only in the doctrine of the second coming of our Lord amid the\r\nclouds of heaven, A.D. 410.\r\n\r\n(M1171) After six days the Goths evacuated the city, and advanced on the\r\nAppian way, to the southern provinces of Italy, destroying ruthlessly all\r\nwho opposed their march, and laden with the spoil of Rome. The beautiful\r\nvillas of the Campanian coast, where the masters of the world had\r\nluxuriated for centuries, were destroyed or plundered, and the rude Goths\r\ngave themselves up to all the license of barbaric soldiers.\r\n\r\n(M1172) At length, gorged with wine and plunder, they prepared to invade\r\nSicily, when Alaric sickened and died in Bruttium, and was buried beneath\r\nthe bed of a river, that the place of his sepulchre should never be found\r\nout. He was succeeded by his brother-in-law, Adolphus, with whom Honorius\r\nconcluded peace, and whom he created a general of his armies. As such, he\r\nled his forces into Gaul, and the southern part of the country became the\r\nseat of their permanent settlement, with Toulouse for a capital. The\r\nVisigoths extended their conquests on both sides of the Pyrenees;\r\nVandalusia was conquered by his son, Wallia, A.D. 418, on whom the emperor\r\nbestowed Aquitania. His son, Theodoric, was the first king of the Goths.\r\n\r\n(M1173) The same year that saw the establishment of this new Gothic\r\nkingdom, also witnessed the foundation of the kingdom of the Franks, by\r\nPharamund, and the final loss of Britain. Thus province after province was\r\nwrested away from the emperor, who died, A.D. 423, and was succeeded by\r\nConstantius, who had married his sister. He died the same year, leaving an\r\ninfant, called Valentinian. The chief secretary of the late emperor, John,\r\nwas proclaimed emperor; but he was dethroned two years after, and\r\nValentinian III. six years of age, reigned in his stead, favored by the\r\nservices of two able generals, Boniface and Aetius, who arrested by their\r\ntalents the incursions of the barbarians, But they quarreled, and their\r\ndiscord led to the loss of Africa, invaded by the Vandals.\r\n\r\n(M1174) These barbarians also belonged to the great Teutonic race, and\r\ntheir settlements were on the Elbe and the Vistula. In the time of Marcus\r\nAurelius they had invaded the empire, but were signally defeated. One\r\nhundred years later, they settled in Pannonia, where they had a bitter\r\ncontest with the Goths. Defeated by them, they sought the protection of\r\nRome, and enlisted in her armies. In 406 they invaded Gaul, and advanced\r\nto the Pyrenees, inflicting every atrocity. They then crossed into Spain,\r\nand settled in Andalusia, A.D. 409, and resumed the agricultural life they\r\nhad led in Pannonia. The Roman governor of Spain intrigued with their old\r\nenemies, the Goths, then settled in Gaul, to make an attack upon them,\r\nunder Wallia. Worried and incensed, the Vandals turned against the Romans,\r\nand routed them, and got possession of the peninsula.\r\n\r\n(M1175) It was then that Aetius, the general of Valentinian III.,\r\npersuaded the emperor,—or rather his mother, Placidia, the real ruler,—to\r\nrecall Boniface from the government of Africa. He refused the summons,\r\nrevolted, and called to his aid the Vandals, who had possession of Spain.\r\nThey were commanded by Genseric, one of those hideous monsters, who\r\ncombined great military talents with every vice. He responded to the call\r\nof Boniface, and invaded Africa, rich in farms and cities, whose capital,\r\nCarthage, was once more the rival of Rome, and had even outgrown\r\nAlexandria as a commercial city. With fifty thousand warriors, Genseric\r\ndevastated the country, and Boniface, too late repenting of his error,\r\nturned against the common foe, but was defeated, and obliged to cede to\r\nthe barbarians three important provinces, A.D. 432.\r\n\r\n(M1176) Peace was not of long duration, and the Vandals renewed the war,\r\non the retreat of Boniface to Italy, where he was killed in a duel, by\r\nAetius. All Africa was overrun, and Carthage was taken and plundered, and\r\nmet a doom as awful as Tyre and Jerusalem, for her iniquities were\r\nflagrant, and called to heaven for vengeance. In the sack of the city, the\r\nwritings of Augustine, bishop of Hippo, were fortunately preserved as a\r\nthesaurus of Christian theological literature, the influence of which can\r\nhardly be overrated in the dark period which succeeded, A.D. 439.\r\n\r\n(M1177) The Vandals then turned their eyes to Rome, and landed on the\r\nItalian coast. The last hope of the imperial city, now threatened by an\r\noverwhelming force, was her Christian bishop—the great Leo, who hastened\r\nto the barbarians’ camp, and in his pontifical robes, sought the mercy of\r\nthe unrelenting and savage foe. But he could secure no better terms, than\r\nthat the unresisting should be spared, the buildings protected from fire,\r\nand the captives from torture. But this promise was only partially\r\nfulfilled. The pillage lasted fourteen days and fourteen nights, and all\r\nthat the Goths had spared was transported to the ships of Genseric. The\r\nstatues of the old pagan gods, which adorned the capitol, the holy vessels\r\nof the Jewish temple, which Titus had brought from Jerusalem, the shrines\r\nand altars of the Christian churches, the costly ornaments of the imperial\r\npalace, the sideboards of massive silver from senatorial mansions,—the\r\ngold, the silver, the brass, the precious marbles,—were all transported to\r\nthe ships. The Empress Eudoxia, herself, stripped of her jewels, was\r\ncarried away captive, with her two daughters, the sole survivors of the\r\nfamily of Theodosius.\r\n\r\n(M1178) Such was the doom of Rome, A.D. 455, forty-five years after the\r\nGothic invasion. The haughty city met the fate which she had inflicted on\r\nher rivals, and nothing remained but desolation and recollections.\r\n\r\n(M1179) While the Vandals were plundering Rome, the Huns—a Sclavonic race,\r\nhideous and revolting barbarians, under Attila, called the scourge of God,\r\nwere ravaging the remaining provinces of the empire. Never since the days\r\nof Xerxes was there such a gathering of nations as now inundated the Roman\r\nworld—some five hundred thousand warriors, chiefly Asiatic, armed with\r\nlong quivers and heavy lances, cuirasses of plaited hair, scythes, round\r\nbucklers, and short swords. This host, composed of Huns, Alans, Gepidæ,\r\nand other tribes, German as well as Asiatic, from the plains of Sarmatia,\r\nand the banks of the Vistula and Niemen, extended from Bash to the mouth\r\nof the Rhine. The great object of attack was Orleans—an important\r\nstrategic position.\r\n\r\n(M1180) The leader of the imperial forces was Aetius, banished for the\r\ndeath of Boniface, composed of Britains, Franks, Burgundians, Sueves,\r\nSaxons, and Visigoths. It was not now the Romans against barbarians, but\r\nEurope against Asia. The contending forces met on the plains of Champagne,\r\nand at Chalons was fought the decisive battle by which Europe was\r\ndelivered from Asia, and the Gothic nations from the Mongol races, A.D.\r\n451. Attila was beaten, and Gaul was saved from Sclavonic invaders. It is\r\nsaid that three hundred thousand of the barbarians, on both sides, were\r\nslain.\r\n\r\nThe discomfited king of the Huns led back his forces to the Rhine,\r\nravaging the country through which he passed. The following year he\r\ninvaded Italy.\r\n\r\n(M1181) Aetius had won one of the greatest victories of ancient times, and\r\nalone remained to stem the barbaric hosts. But he was mistrusted by the\r\nemperor at Ravenna, whose daughter he had solicited in marriage for his\r\nson, and was left without sufficient force. Aquileia, the most important\r\ncity in Northern Italy, fell into the hands of Attila. He then resolved to\r\ncross the Apennines and give a last blow to Rome. Leo, the intrepid\r\nbishop, sought his camp, as he had once before entreated Genseric. The Hun\r\nconsented to leave Italy for an annual tribute, and the hand of the\r\nprincess Honoria, sister of the Emperor Valentinian. He retired to the\r\nDanube by the passes of the Alps, and spent the winter in bacchanalian\r\norgies, but was cut off in his career by the poisoned dagger of a\r\nBurgundian princess, whose relations he had slain.\r\n\r\n(M1182) The retreat of the Huns did not deliver the wasted provinces of a\r\nnow fallen empire from renewed ravages. For twenty years longer, Italy was\r\nsubject to incessant depredations. Valentinian, the last emperor of the\r\nfamily of Theodosius, was assassinated A.D. 455, at the instigation of\r\nMaximus—a senator of the Anician family, whose wife had been violated by\r\nthe emperor. The successive reigns of Maximus, Avitus, Majorian, Severus,\r\nAnthemius, Olybrius, Glycerins, Nepos,and Augustulus—nine emperors in\r\ntwenty-one years, suggest nothing but ignominy and misfortune. They were\r\nshut up in their palaces, within the walls of Ravenna, and were unable to\r\narrest the ruin. Again, during this period, was Rome sacked by the\r\nVandals. The great men of the period were Theodoric—king of the\r\nOstrogoths, who ruled both sides of the Alps, and supported the crumbling\r\nempire, and Count Ricimer, a Sueve, and generalissimo of the Roman armies.\r\nIt was at this disastrous epoch that fugitives from the Venetian territory\r\nsought a refuge among the islands which skirt the northern coast of the\r\nAdriatic—the haunts of fishermen and sea-birds. There Venice was born—to\r\nrevive the glory of the West, and write her history upon the waves for one\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\n(M1183) The last emperor was the son of Orestes—a Pannonian, who was\r\nchristened Romulus. When elevated by the soldiers upon a shield and\r\nsaluted Augustus, he was too small to wear the purple robe, and they\r\ncalled him Augustulus!—a bitter mockery, recalling the foundation and the\r\nimperial greatness of Rome. This prince, feeble and powerless, was\r\ndethroned by Odoacer—chief of the Heruli, and one of the unscrupulous\r\nmercenaries whose aid the last emperor had invoked. The throne of the\r\nCæsars was now hopelessly subverted, and Odoacer portioned out the lands\r\nof Italy among his greedy followers, but allowed Augustulus to live as a\r\npensioner in a Campanian villa, which had once belonged to Sulla, A.D.\r\n476. Odoacer, however, reigned but fourteen years, and was supplanted by\r\nTheodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, A.D. 490. The barbarians were now\r\nfairly settled in the lands they had invaded, and the Western empire was\r\ncompletely dismembered.\r\n\r\n(M1184) In Italy were the Ostrogoths, who established a powerful kingdom,\r\nafterward assailed by Belisarius and Narses, the generals of Justinian,\r\nthe Eastern emperor, and also by the Lombards, under Alboin, who secured a\r\nfooting in the north of Italy. Gaul was divided among the Franks,\r\nBurgundians, and Visigoths, among whom were perpetual wars. Britain was\r\npossessed by the Saxons. Spain became the inheritance of Vandals, Suevi,\r\nand Visigoths. The Vandals retained Africa. The Eastern empire, with the\r\nexception of Constantinople, finally fell into the hands of the Saracens.\r\n\r\n(M1185) It would be interesting to trace the various fortunes of the\r\nTeutonic nations in their new settlements, but this belongs to mediæval\r\nhistory. The real drama of the fall of Rome was ended when Alaric gained\r\npossession of the imperial city. “The empire fell,” says Guizot, “because\r\nno one would belong to it.” At the period of barbaric invasion it had lost\r\nall real vigor, and was kept together by mechanism—the mechanism of\r\ngovernment which had been one thousand years perfecting. It was energy,\r\npatriotism, patience, and a genius for government which built up the\r\nempire. But prosperity led to luxury, self-exaggeration, and enervating\r\nvices. Society was steeped in sensuality, frivolity, and selfishness. The\r\nempire was rotten to the core, and must become the prey of barbarians, who\r\nhad courage and vitality. Three centuries earlier, the empire might have\r\nwithstood the shock of external enemies, and the barbarians might have\r\nbeen annihilated. But they invaded the provinces when central power was\r\nweak, when public virtue had fled, when the middle classes were extinct,\r\nwhen slavery, demoralizing pleasures, and disproportionate fortunes\r\ndestroyed elevation of sentiment, and all manly energies. A noble line of\r\nmartial emperors for a time arrested ruin, but ruin was inevitable.\r\nNatural law asserted its dignity. The penalty of sin must be paid. Nothing\r\ncould save the empire. No conservative influences were sufficiently\r\nstrong—neither literature, nor art, nor science, nor philosophy, nor even\r\nChristianity. Society retrograded as the new religion triumphed, a\r\nmysterious fact, but easily understood when we remember that vices were\r\nuniversal before a remedy could be applied. The victories of Christianity\r\ncame not too late for the human race, but too late for the salvation of a\r\nworn-out empire.\r\n\r\nThe barbarians were advancing when Constantine was converted. The\r\nsalvation of the race was through these barbarians themselves, for, though\r\nthey desolated, they reconstructed; and, when converted to the new faith,\r\nestablished new institutions on a better basis. The glimmering life-sparks\r\nof a declining and miserable world disappeared, but new ideas, new\r\npassions, new interests arose, and on the ruins of the pagan civilization\r\nnew Christian empires were founded, which have been gaining power for one\r\nthousand five hundred years, and which may not pass away till civilization\r\nitself shall be pronounced a failure in the present dispensations of the\r\nMoral Governor of the World.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH REVIEW.—“The BEST History of the Roman Republic.”\r\n\r\nLONDON TIMES—“BY FAR THE BEST History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman\r\nCommonwealth.”\r\n\r\nNOW READY, VOLUME I, of the History of Rome, FROM THE EARLIEST TIME TO THE\r\nPERIOD OF ITS DECLINE.\r\n\r\nBy Dr. THEODOR MOMMSEN.\r\n\r\nTranslated, with the author’s sanction and additions, by the Rev.
