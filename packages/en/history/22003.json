After the death of his father he is\r\n     accused of plotting against his brother Artaxerxes, who imprisons\r\n     him, but releases him on the intercession of his mother, and sends\r\n     him back to his province, where he secretly collects forces, of\r\n     which a large proportion are from Greece, to make war on his\r\n     brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Of Darius[1] and Parysatis were born two sons,[2] the elder\r\nArtaxerxes,[3] and the younger Cyrus. After Darius had fallen sick, and\r\nsuspected that the end of his life was approaching, he was desirous that\r\nboth of his sons should attend him.\r\n\r\n2. The elder then happened to be present; Cyrus he sent for from the\r\nprovince of which he had made him satrap. He had also appointed him\r\ncommander of all the forces that muster in the plain of Castolus.[4]\r\n\r\nCyrus accordingly went up, taking with him Tissaphernes as a friend, and\r\nhaving also with him three hundred heavy-armed Greeks,[5] and Xenias of\r\nParrhasia,[6] their captain.\r\n\r\n3. But when Darius was dead, and Artaxerxes was placed upon the throne,\r\nTissaphernes brought an accusation against Cyrus before his brother,\r\nsaying that he was plotting against him. Artaxerxes was induced to give\r\ncredit to it, and had Cyrus arrested, with the intention of putting him\r\nto death; but his mother, having begged his life, sent him back to his\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n4. When Cyrus had departed, after being thus in danger and disgrace, he\r\nbegan to consider by what means he might cease to be subject to his\r\nbrother, and make himself king, if he could, in his stead. Parysatis,\r\ntheir mother, was well disposed towards Cyrus,[7] as she loved him\r\nbetter than Artaxerxes, who was on the throne. 5. Whatever messengers\r\nfrom the king[8] came to visit him, he let none of them go till he had\r\ninclined them to be friends to himself, rather than the monarch.[9] He\r\nalso paid such attention to the Barbarians[10] that were with him, that\r\nthey were in a condition to take the field, and well inclined towards\r\nhimself. 6. His Greek force he collected as secretly as he could, that\r\nhe might surprise the king as little prepared as possible.\r\n\r\nHe collected troops in the following manner. Whatever garrisons he had\r\nin his towns, he sent orders to the commanders of them to procure\r\nrespectively as many Peloponnesians as they could, of the best class of\r\nsoldiers, on pretence that Tissaphernes was forming designs upon those\r\ntowns. For the cities of Ionia had formerly been, under the government\r\nof Tissaphernes, having been assigned to him by the king, but had at\r\nthis time all revolted to Cyrus except Miletus. 7. Tissaphernes,\r\ndiscovering that the people of Miletus were forming a similar design,\r\n[to go over to Cyrus,[11]] put some of them to death, and sent others\r\ninto banishment. Cyrus, receiving the exiles under his protection, and\r\nassembling an army, laid siege to Miletus by land and sea, and used\r\nevery exertion to restore these exiles; and he had thus another pretext\r\nfor augmenting the number of his forces. 8. He then sent to the king,\r\nand requested that, as he was his brother, these cities should be given\r\nto him rather than that Tissaphernes should govern them; and in this\r\napplication his mother supported him. Thus the king had no suspicion of\r\nthe plot against him, but supposed that Cyrus, from being at war with\r\nTissaphernes, was spending the money upon troops; so that he was not at\r\nall concerned at the strife between them, especially as Cyrus remitted\r\nto him the tribute arising from the cities which Tissaphernes had had.\r\n\r\n9. Another army was collected for him in the Chersonesus opposite\r\nAbydos, in the following method. Clearchus, a Lacedæmonian, happened to\r\nbe in exile. Cyrus, having met with him, was struck with admiration for\r\nhim, and made him a present of ten thousand darics.[12] Clearchus, on\r\nreceiving the gold, raised, by means of it, a body of troops, and making\r\nexcursions out of the Chersonesus, made war upon the Thracians that are\r\nsituated above the Hellespont, and was of assistance to the Greeks; so\r\nthat the towns on the Hellespont willingly contributed money for the\r\nsupport of his men. This too was a force thus secretly maintained for\r\nCyrus.\r\n\r\n10. Aristippus, also, a Thessalian, happened to be a guest-friend[13] of\r\nCyrus, and, being pressed by an adverse faction at home, came to him,\r\nand asked him for two thousand mercenary troops, and three months' pay\r\nfor them, representing that he would thus be enabled to overpower his\r\nenemies. Cyrus granted him four thousand, and six months' pay, desiring\r\nhim not to terminate the strife until he should consult him. Thus\r\nanother body of troops was clandestinely supported for him in Thessaly.\r\n\r\n11. He then requested Proxenus a Bœotian, who was also his\r\nguest-friend, to join him with as many men as he could procure, stating\r\nthat he intended to make war on the Pisidians, as they molested his\r\nterritories. He also desired Sophænetus of Stymphalus,[14] and Socrates,\r\nan Achæan, both of them his guest-friends, to come to him, and bring as\r\nmany men as possible, pretending that he was going to war with\r\nTissaphernes on behalf of the Milesian exiles; and they acted as he\r\nwished.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Darius II., surnamed Nothus, who reigned from B.

Weights and Money_, ch. iii. sect. 12, at £243 15_s._, the value\r\nof the daric will be 16_s._ 3_d._ The sum given to Clearchus will then\r\nbe £8125.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Ξένος.] I have translated this word by _guest-friend_, a\r\nconvenient term, which made its appearance in our language some time\r\nago.

The city of Celænæ; the\r\n     plain of Caystrus, where the soldiers demand their arrears of pay,\r\n     which Cyrus discharges with money received from the queen of\r\n     Cilicia. The town of Thymbrium; the fountain of Midas. Cyrus enters\r\n     Cilicia, and is met at Tarsus by Syennesis, the king of the\r\n     country.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. When it seemed to him time to march up into the country, he made it\r\nhis pretext for doing so that he wished to expel the Pisidians entirely\r\nfrom the territory, and mustered, as if for the purpose of attacking\r\nthem, the whole of the troops, as well Barbarian as Greek, that were on\r\nthe spot.[15] He also sent word to Clearchus to join him, bringing\r\nwhatever force was at his command; and to Aristippus, as soon as he had\r\ncome to terms with the party at home, to send him back the troops that\r\nhe had. He also desired Xenias the Arcadian, who commanded for him the\r\nmercenaries in the several towns, to bring him all his men except such\r\nas would be required to garrison the citadels. 2. He summoned, too, the\r\narmy that was besieging Miletus, and invited the exiles to accompany him\r\non his expedition; promising them, that if he successfully accomplished\r\nthe objects for which he undertook it, he would never rest till he had\r\nre-established them in their country. They cheerfully consented, as they\r\nhad confidence in him, and, taking their arms, joined him at Sardis.\r\n\r\n3. To Sardis also came Xenias, bringing with him the troops from the\r\nseveral towns, to the number of four thousand heavy-armed men. Thither\r\ncame also Proxenus, with heavy-armed men to the number of fifteen\r\nhundred, and five hundred light-armed; Sophænetus the Stymphalian with a\r\nthousand heavy-armed; Socrates the Achæan with five hundred; and Pasion\r\nof Megara with three hundred heavy-armed, and the same number of\r\npeltasts.[16] Both Pasion and Socrates were among those serving in the\r\narmy at Miletus.\r\n\r\n4. These joined him at Sardis. Tissaphernes, observing these\r\nproceedings, and considering the force to be greater than was necessary\r\nto attack the Pisidians, set out, with all possible speed, to give\r\nnotice of the matter to the king, taking with him about five hundred\r\ncavalry; 5. and the king, as soon as he heard from Tissaphernes of the\r\npreparations of Cyrus, made arrangements to oppose him.\r\n\r\nCyrus, at the head of the force which I have stated, commenced his\r\njourney from Sardis,[17] and proceeded through Lydia, three days'\r\nmarch,[18] a distance of twenty-two parasangs,[19] as far as the river\r\nMæander. The breadth of this river is two plethra,[20] and a bridge was\r\nthrown over it, constructed of seven boats. 6. Having crossed the\r\nstream, he went forward through Phrygia, one day's march, eight\r\nparasangs, till he reached Colossæ, a populous city, wealthy and of\r\nconsiderable magnitude. Here he halted seven days; when Menon the\r\nThessalian joined him with a thousand heavy-armed troops and five\r\nhundred peltasts, consisting of Dolopians, Ænianes, and Olynthians.\r\n\r\n7. Hence he proceeded in three days' march, a distance of twenty\r\nparasangs, to Celænæ, a populous, large, and rich city of Phrygia. Here\r\nCyrus had a palace, and an extensive park full of wild beasts, which he\r\nwas accustomed to hunt on horseback whenever he wished to give himself\r\nand his horses exercise. Through the middle of this park flows the river\r\nMæander; its springs issue from the palace itself; and it runs also\r\nthrough the city of Celænæ. 8. There is also at Celænæ a palace of the\r\nGreat King,[21] situated near the source of the river Marsyas, under the\r\ncitadel. This river too runs through the city, and falls into the\r\nMæander. The breadth of the Marsyas is twenty-five feet. Here Apollo is\r\nsaid to have flayed Marsyas, after conquering him in a trial of musical\r\nskill, and to have hung up his skin in the cave, where the source of the\r\nstream rises: and on this account the river is called the Marsyas. 9.\r\nXerxes is said to have built both this palace and the citadel of\r\nCelænæ, when he was returning from Greece after his discomfiture in\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nCyrus remained here thirty days; during which time Clearchus, the\r\nLacedæmonian exile, joined him with a thousand heavy-armed men, eight\r\nhundred Thracian peltasts, and two hundred Cretan archers. At the same\r\ntime Sosis[22] of Syracuse arrived with three hundred heavy-armed men,\r\nand Sophænetus, an Arcadian, with a thousand. Here Cyrus held a review\r\nof the Greeks in the park, and took their number; and they were in all\r\neleven thousand heavy-armed troops, and about two thousand peltasts.[23]\r\n10. Hence he proceeded two days' march, a distance of ten parasangs, to\r\nPeltæ, a well-peopled city, where he halted three days, during which\r\nXenias the Arcadian celebrated the sacred rites of Lycæan Jove,[24] and\r\nheld public games on the occasion; in which the prizes were golden\r\nstrigiles.[25] Cyrus was present at the games as a spectator. Thence he\r\nproceeded, two days' march, twelve parasangs, to Ceramon Agora, a\r\npopulous city, the last on the side of Mysia.\r\n\r\n11. Hence he proceeded, in three days' march, the distance of thirty\r\nparasangs, to the Plain of Caystrus, a populous city. Here he halted\r\nfive days; and at this time more than three months' pay was due to the\r\ntroops, which they frequently went to his tent to demand. Cyrus put them\r\noff, giving them hopes, but was evidently distressed; for it was no\r\npart of his character not to pay when he had the means. 12. But while he\r\nwas there, Epyaxa, the wife of Syennesis king of the Cilicians, paid him\r\na visit, and was said to have presented him with a large sum of money.\r\nHe in consequence gave the troops pay for four months. The Cilician\r\nqueen had with her a body-guard of Cilicians and Aspendians; and it was\r\nreported that Cyrus had connexion with her.\r\n\r\n13. Hence he proceeded two days' march, ten parasangs, to Thymbrium, a\r\npopulous city. Here, by the road-side, was a fountain, called the\r\nfountain of Midas, king of Phrygia; at which Midas is said to have\r\ncaptured the Satyr,[26] by mixing wine with the water.\r\n\r\n14. Hence he proceeded, two days' march, ten parasangs, to Tyriæum, a\r\nwell-peopled city, where he stayed three days. The Cilician queen is\r\nsaid to have requested Cyrus to show her his army. With the desire\r\ntherefore of exhibiting it to her, he reviewed his troops, as well Greek\r\nas Barbarian, in the plain. 15. He ordered the Greeks to be marshalled,\r\nand to take their places, as they were accustomed to do for battle, each\r\ncaptain arranging his own men. They were accordingly drawn up four deep;\r\nMenon and his troops took the right wing; Clearchus and his men the\r\nleft; and the other captains occupied the centre. 16. First of all,\r\nthen, Cyrus reviewed the Barbarians, who marched past him, drawn up in\r\ntroops and companies;[27] and afterwards the Greeks, riding by them in\r\nhis chariot, with the Cilician queen in her car.[28] They had all brazen\r\nhelmets, scarlet tunics, greaves, and polished shields. 17. When he had\r\nridden past them all, he stopped his chariot in front of their phalanx,\r\nand sent Pigres the interpreter to the Greek officers, with orders for\r\nthem to present arms,[29] and to advance with their whole phalanx. The\r\nofficers communicated these orders to their soldiers; and, when the\r\ntrumpeter gave the signal, they presented arms and advanced. Then, as\r\nthey proceeded with a quicker pace and loud shouts, the soldiers of\r\ntheir own accord took to running, bearing down upon the tents of the\r\nPersians. 18. Upon this, there arose great terror among the rest of the\r\nBarbarians; the Cilician queen fled from her car; and the people in the\r\nmarket deserted their goods and took to their heels; while the Greeks\r\nmarched up to the tents with laughter. The Cilician queen, on beholding\r\nthe splendour and discipline of the army, was struck with admiration;\r\nand Cyrus was delighted when he saw the terror with which the Greeks\r\ninspired the Barbarians.\r\n\r\n19. Hence he advanced, three days' march, a distance of twenty\r\nparasangs, to Iconium, the last town of Phrygia; where he halted three\r\ndays. He then went forward through Lycaonia, five days' march, a\r\ndistance of thirty parasangs; and this country, as being that of an\r\nenemy, he permitted the Greeks to ravage.\r\n\r\n20. From hence Cyrus despatched the Cilician queen, by the shortest\r\nroad, into Cilicia; and sent with her the troops which Menon had, and\r\nMenon himself. Cyrus, with the rest of the army, proceeded through\r\nCappadocia, four days' march, a distance of twenty-five parasangs, to\r\nDana, a populous, large, and wealthy city. Here he stayed three days; in\r\nthe course of which he put to death a Persian, named Megaphernes, a\r\nwearer of the royal purple,[30] and a certain other person in power, one\r\nof the provincial governors having accused them of conspiring against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n21. They then made an attempt to enter Cilicia; but the sole entrance\r\nwas a road broad enough only for a single carriage, very steep, and\r\nimpracticable for an army to pass, if any one opposed them. Syennesis,\r\nbesides, was said to be stationed on the heights, guarding the defile;\r\non which account Cyrus halted for a day in the plain. The next day, a\r\nmessenger came to inform him that Syennesis had quitted the heights, on\r\nreceiving information that Menon's army was already in Cilicia within\r\nthe mountains, and hearing that Tamos had a number of galleys, belonging\r\nto the Lacedæmonians and Cyrus himself, sailing round from Ionia to\r\nCilicia. 22. Cyrus accordingly ascended the mountains without any\r\nopposition, and saw[31] the tents in which the Cilicians kept guard.\r\nHence he descended into a large and beautiful plain, well watered, and\r\nabounding with all kinds of trees, as well as vines. It also produced\r\ngreat quantities of sesamum, panic, millet,[32] wheat, and barley. A\r\nchain of hills, strong and high, encompasses it on all sides from sea to\r\nsea. 23. Descending through this plain, he proceeded, in four days'\r\nmarch, a distance of twenty-five parasangs, to Tarsus, a large and\r\nopulent city of Cilicia. Here was the palace of Syennesis, the king of\r\nthe Cilicians; and through the midst of the city runs a river, called\r\nthe Cydnus, the breadth of which is two plethra. 24. This city the\r\ninhabitants, with Syennesis, had deserted for a strong-hold upon the\r\nmountains, except those who kept shops.[33] Those also remained behind,\r\nwho lived near the sea at Soli and at Issi.\r\n\r\n25. Epyaxa, the wife of Syennesis, had arrived at Tarsus five days\r\nbefore Cyrus. But in passing over the mountains which skirt the plain,\r\ntwo companies of Menon's troops had perished; some said that they had\r\nbeen cut to pieces by the Cilicians, while committing some\r\ndepredations; others, that being left behind, and unable to find the\r\nrest of the army or their road, they had been destroyed while wandering\r\nabout. They amounted to a hundred heavy-armed men. 26. When the rest of\r\nMenon's troops came up, full of resentment at the fate of their\r\ncomrades, they plundered both the city of Tarsus and the palace in it.\r\nCyrus, on entering the city, sent for Syennesis to come to him; but\r\nSyennesis answered, that he had never yet put himself in the power of\r\none stronger than himself; nor would he then consent to go to Cyrus,\r\nuntil his wife prevailed upon him, and he received solemn assurances of\r\nsafety. 27. Afterwards, when they had met, Syennesis gave Cyrus a large\r\nsum of money for the support of his army, and Cyrus in return presented\r\nhim with such gifts as are held in estimation by a king, a horse with a\r\ngolden bit, a golden chain and bracelets, and a golden scimitar and\r\nPersian robe. He also engaged that his country should no more be\r\nplundered, and that he should receive back the captured slaves, if they\r\nanywhere met with them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Τό τε βαρβαρικὸν καὶ τὸ Ἑλληνικὸν τὸ ἐνταῦθα στράτευμα.]\r\nThere has been much dispute about the exact signification of ἐνταῦθα in\r\nthis place. Zeune would have it mean \"illuc, in illum locum ubi sunt\r\nPisidæ;\" and Krüger thinks that \"towards Sardis\" is intended. But this\r\nis to do violence to the word; I have followed Weiske and Kühner, who\r\ngive it its ordinary signification. \"Barbarorum et Græcorum\r\n[exercitum],\" says Kühner, \"quem Cyrus ibi, ubi versabatur, collectum\r\nhabebat.\" The τὸ before ἐνταῦθα is an addition of Dindorf's, which\r\nKühner pronounces unnecessary.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: The πελτασταὶ were troops armed with a light shield,\r\ncalled πέλτη, holding a middle place between the ὁπλῖται and ψιλοί. They\r\nwere first made an efficient part of the Greek forces by Iphicrates: see\r\nhis Life in Corn. Nep.; and Xen. Hellen. iv. 4. 16; 3. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Xenophon begins his account of the expedition from Sardis,\r\nbecause he there joined the army, but afterwards constantly computes\r\nfrom Ephesus, the sea-port from whence he began his journey.\r\n_Stanford_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Σταθμοός.] The word σταθμός means properly a _station_ or\r\n_halting-place_ at the end of a day's march, of which the length varied,\r\nbut was generally about five parasangs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: The parasang in Xenophon is equal to thirty stadia; see\r\nii. 2. 6. So Herodotus, ii. 6; v. 53. Mr. Ainsworth, following Mr.\r\nHamilton and Colonel Leake, makes the parasang equal to 3 English miles,\r\n180 yards, or 3 geographical miles of 1822 yards each. _Travels in the\r\nTrack_, pref. p. xii. Thus five parasangs would be a long day's march;\r\nthese marches were more than seven; and the next day's was eight. But\r\nRennell thinks the parasang not more than 2.78 English miles.

But being told by Cyrus that\r\n     the expedition is directed against Abrocomas, and promised an\r\n     increase of pay, they agree to continue their march.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Here Cyrus and the army remained twenty days; for the soldiers\r\nrefused to proceed farther, as they now began to suspect that they were\r\nmarching against the king, and said that they had not been hired for\r\nthis purpose. Clearchus, first of all, endeavoured to compel his\r\nsoldiers to proceed; but, as soon as he began to advance, they pelted\r\nhim and his baggage-cattle with stones. 2. Clearchus, indeed, on this\r\noccasion, had a narrow escape of being stoned to death. At length, when\r\nhe saw that he should not be able to proceed by force, he called a\r\nmeeting of his soldiers; and at first, standing before them, he\r\ncontinued for some time to shed tears, while they, looking on, were\r\nstruck with wonder, and remained silent. He then addressed them to this\r\neffect:\r\n\r\n3. \"Wonder not, soldiers, that I feel distressed at the present\r\noccurrences; for Cyrus engaged himself to me by ties of hospitality, and\r\nhonoured me, when I was an exile from my country, both with other marks\r\nof esteem, and by presenting me with ten thousand darics. On receiving\r\nthis money, I did not treasure it up for my own use, or squander it in\r\nluxury, but spent it upon you. 4. First of all, I made war upon the\r\nThracians, and, in the cause of Greece, and with your assistance, took\r\nvengeance upon them by expelling them from the Chersonesus, when they\r\nwould have taken the country from its Grecian colonists. When Cyrus\r\nsummoned me, I set out to join him, taking you with me, that if he had\r\nneed of my aid, I might do him service in return for the benefits that I\r\nhad received from him. 5. But since you are unwilling to accompany him\r\non this expedition, I am under the obligation, either, by deserting you,\r\nto preserve the friendship of Cyrus, or, by proving false to him, to\r\nadhere to you. Whether I shall do right, I do not know; but I shall give\r\nyou the preference, and will undergo with you whatever may be necessary.\r\nNor shall any one ever say, that, after leading Greeks into a country of\r\nBarbarians, I deserted the Greeks, and adopted, in preference, the\r\nfriendship of the Barbarians.\r\n\r\n6. \"Since, however, you decline to obey me, or to follow me, I will go\r\nwith you, and submit to whatever may be destined for us. For I look upon\r\nyou to be at once my country, my friends, and my fellow-soldiers, and\r\nconsider that with you I shall be respected, wherever I may be: but\r\nthat, if separated from you, I shall be unable either to afford\r\nassistance to a friend, or to avenge myself upon an enemy. Feel assured,\r\ntherefore, that I am resolved to accompany you wherever you go.\"\r\n\r\n7. Thus he spoke; and the soldiers, as well those under his own command\r\nas the others, on hearing these assurances, applauded him for saying\r\nthat he would not march against the king; and more than two thousand of\r\nthe troops of Xenias and Pasion, taking with them their arms and\r\nbaggage, went and encamped under Clearchus.\r\n\r\n8. Cyrus, perplexed and grieved at these occurrences, sent for\r\nClearchus; who, however, would not go, but sending a messenger to Cyrus\r\nwithout the knowledge of the soldiers, bade him be of good courage, as\r\nthese matters would be arranged to his satisfaction. He also desired\r\nCyrus to send for him again, but, when Cyrus had done so, he again\r\ndeclined to go.[34] 9. Afterwards, having assembled his own soldiers,\r\nand those who had recently gone over to him, and any of the rest that\r\nwished to be present, he spoke to the following effect:\r\n\r\n\"It is evident, soldiers, that the situation of Cyrus with regard to us\r\nis the same as ours with regard to him; for we are no longer his\r\nsoldiers, since we refuse to follow him, nor is he any longer our\r\npaymaster. 10. That he considers himself wronged by us, however, I am\r\nwell aware; so that, even when he sends for me, I am unwilling to go to\r\nhim, principally from feeling shame, because I am conscious of having\r\nbeen in all respects false to him; and in addition, from being afraid,\r\nthat, when he has me in his power, he may take vengeance on me for the\r\nmatters in which he conceives that he has been injured. 11. This,\r\ntherefore, seems to me to be no time for us to sleep, or to neglect our\r\nown safety; but, on the contrary, to consider what we must do under\r\nthese circumstances.[35] As long as we remain here, it seems necessary\r\nto consider how we may best remain with safety; or, if we determine upon\r\ngoing at once, how we may depart with the greatest security, and how we\r\nmay obtain provisions; for without these, the general and the private\r\nsoldier are alike inefficient.[36] 12. Cyrus is indeed a most valuable\r\nfriend to those to whom he is a friend, but a most violent enemy to\r\nthose to whom he is an enemy. He has forces, too, both infantry and\r\ncavalry, as well as a naval power, as we all alike see and know; for we\r\nseem to me to be encamped at no great distance from him. It is therefore\r\nfull time to say whatever any one thinks to be best.\" Having spoken\r\nthus, he made a pause.\r\n\r\n13. Upon this, several rose to speak; some, of their own accord, to\r\nexpress what they thought; others, previously instructed by Clearchus,\r\nto point out what difficulty there would be, either in remaining or\r\ndeparting, without the consent of Cyrus. 14. One of these, pretending\r\nto be eager to proceed with all possible haste to Greece, proposed that\r\nthey should choose other commanders without delay, if Clearchus were\r\nunwilling to conduct them back; that they should purchase provisions, as\r\nthere was a market in the Barbarian camp, and pack up their baggage;\r\nthat they should go to Cyrus, and ask him to furnish them with ships, in\r\nwhich they might sail home; and, if he should not grant them, that they\r\nshould beg of him a guide, to conduct them back through such parts of\r\nthe country as were friendly towards them.[37] But if he would not even\r\nallow them a guide, that they should, without delay, form themselves in\r\nwarlike order, and send a detachment to take possession of the heights,\r\nin order that neither Cyrus nor the Cilicians, (\"of whom,\" said he, \"we\r\nhave many prisoners, and much money that we have taken,\") may be the\r\nfirst to occupy them. Such were the suggestions that he offered; but\r\nafter him Clearchus spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n15. \"Let no one of you mention me, as likely to undertake this command;\r\nfor I see many reasons why I ought not to do so; but be assured, that\r\nwhatever person you may elect, I shall pay the greatest possible\r\ndeference to him, that you may see that I know how to obey as well as\r\nany other man.\"\r\n\r\n16. After him another arose, who pointed out the folly of him who\r\nadvised them to ask for ships, just as if Cyrus were not about to sail\r\nback,[38] and who showed, too, how foolish it would be to request a\r\nguide of the very person \"whose plans,\" said he, \"we are frustrating.\r\nAnd,\" he added, \"if we should trust the guide that Cyrus might assign\r\nus, what will hinder Cyrus from giving orders to occupy the heights\r\nbefore we reach them? 17. For my own part, I should be reluctant to\r\nembark in any vessel that he might grant us, lest he should send us and\r\nthe galleys to the bottom together; I should also be afraid to follow\r\nany guide that he may appoint, lest he should conduct us into places,\r\nfrom whence there would be no means of escape; and I had rather, if I\r\ndepart without the consent of Cyrus, depart without his knowledge; but\r\nthis is impossible. 18. I say then that such proposals are absurdities;\r\nand my advice is, that certain persons, such as are fit for the task,\r\nshould accompany Clearchus to Cyrus, and ask him in what service he\r\nwishes to employ us; and if the undertaking be similar to that in which\r\nhe before employed foreign troops,[39] that we too should follow him,\r\nand not appear more cowardly than those who previously went up with him.\r\n19. But if the present design seem greater and more difficult and more\r\nperilous than the former, that they should ask him, in that case, either\r\nto induce us to accompany him by persuasion, or, yielding himself to our\r\npersuasions, to give us a passage to a friendly country; for thus, if we\r\naccompany him, we shall accompany him as friends and zealous supporters,\r\nand if we leave him, we shall depart in safety; that they then report to\r\nus what answer he makes to this application; and that we, having heard\r\nhis reply, take measures in accordance with it.\"\r\n\r\n20. These suggestions were approved; and, having chosen certain persons,\r\nthey sent them with Clearchus to ask Cyrus the questions agreed upon by\r\nthe army. Cyrus answered, that he had heard that Abrocomas, an enemy of\r\nhis, was on the banks of the Euphrates, twelve days' march distant; and\r\nit was against him, he said, that he wished to march; and if Abrocomas\r\nshould be there, he said that he longed to take due vengeance on him;\r\nbut if he should retreat, \"we will consider there,\" he added, \"how to\r\nproceed.\"\r\n\r\n21. The delegates, having heard this answer, reported it to the\r\nsoldiers, who had still a suspicion that he was leading them against the\r\nking, but nevertheless resolved to accompany him. They then asked for an\r\nincrease of pay, and Cyrus promised to give them all half as much again\r\nas they received before, that is to say, instead of a daric, three\r\nhalf-darics a month for every soldier. But no one heard there, at least\r\npublicly, that he was leading them against the king.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: He himself, the very person who had desired Cyrus to send\r\nfor him, refused to go; this refusal being given for the sake of keeping\r\nup appearances.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Ἐκ τούτων.] \"Ex his, secundum hæc, h. e. in hac rerum\r\nconditione.\" _Kühner_. Bornemann interprets simply _post hæc_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Οὔτε στρατηγοῦ οὔτε ἰδιώτου ὄφελος οὐδέν.] \"No profit (or\r\nuse) either of a general or private soldier.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Διὰ φιλίας τῆς χώρας.] The earlier editions have ὡς before\r\nδιὰ, of which, as being useless, Schneider first suggested the omission;\r\nand which has accordingly been rejected by subsequent editors. The guide\r\nwas to conduct them only through regions that were friendly to Cyrus, or\r\nwhere he could procure them a friendly reception.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Ὥσπερ πάλιν τὸν στόλον Κύρου μὴ ποιουμένου.] About the\r\nmeaning of these words there has been much dispute. The translation\r\nwhich I have given is that of Bornemann, \"quasi retro Cyrus navigaturus\r\nnon esset,\" which is adopted by Kühner. \"The speaker assumes,\" says\r\nBornemann, \"that Cyrus is directing his march against the Pisidians or\r\nsome other rebellious people, and that, when he has reduced them, he\r\nwill return to his province.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: The reference is to the three hundred Greeks that went up\r\nwith Cyrus to Babylon under the command of Xenias the Parrhasian, i. 1.\r\n2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     The army reaches Issi, the last city in Cilicia, at which the fleet\r\n     then arrives. Cyrus proceeds into Syria, where two of the Greek\r\n     captains, Xenias and Pasion, desert the expedition; the good\r\n     feeling of Cyrus, in forbearing to pursue them, renders the other\r\n     Greeks more willing to accompany him. He arrives at Thapsacus on\r\n     the Euphrates, where he discloses the real object of his expedition\r\n     to the Greek troops, who express discontent, but are induced by\r\n     fresh promises, and the example of Menon, to cross the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Hence he proceeded, two days' march, a distance of ten parasangs, to\r\nthe river Psarus, the breadth of which was three plethra. He then went\r\nforward, one day's march, five parasangs, to the river Pyramus, the\r\nbreadth of which is a stadium. Hence he advanced in two days' march, a\r\ndistance of fifteen parasangs, to Issi, the last city in Cilicia,\r\nsituate upon the sea-coast, a populous, large, and rich place.\r\n\r\n2. Here Cyrus remained three days, in which time the ships from\r\nPeloponnesus, thirty-five in number, arrived, Pythagoras the\r\nLacedæmonian being their commander. But Tamos, an Egyptian, had\r\nconducted the fleet from Ephesus, who had also with him five-and-twenty\r\nother ships, belonging to Cyrus, with which he had blockaded Miletus\r\nwhen it was in the interest of Tissaphernes, and had fought against him\r\non behalf of Cyrus. 3. In these vessels came also Cheirisophus the\r\nLacedæmonian, who had been sent for by Cyrus, and who had with him seven\r\nhundred heavy-armed troops, which he commanded as part of the army of\r\nCyrus. The ships were moored opposite Cyrus's tent. Here, too, the Greek\r\nmercenaries, who were in the pay of Abrocomas, four hundred heavy-armed\r\nmen, deserted him and came over to Cyrus, and joined in the expedition\r\nagainst the king.\r\n\r\n4. Hence he proceeded, one day's march, five parasangs, to the Gates of\r\nCilicia and Syria. These were two fortresses;[40] of the part within\r\nthem, towards Cilicia, Syennesis and a guard of Cilicians had the\r\ncharge; the part without, towards Syria, a garrison of the king's\r\nsoldiers was reported to occupy. Between the two runs a river, called\r\nCarsus, a plethrum in breadth. The whole space between the fortresses\r\nwas three stadia; and it was impossible to pass it by force; for the\r\npassage was very narrow, the walls reached down to the sea, and above\r\nwere inaccessible rocks. At each of the fortresses were gates. 5. It was\r\non account of this passage that Cyrus had sent for the fleet, that he\r\nmight disembark heavy-armed troops within and without the Gates,[41] who\r\nmight force a passage through the enemy, if they still kept guard at the\r\nSyrian gates; a post which he expected Abrocomas would hold, as he had\r\nunder his command a numerous army. Abrocomas however did not attempt\r\nthis; but, when he heard that Cyrus was in Cilicia, retreated out of\r\nPhœnicia, and proceeded to join the king, having with him, as was\r\nsaid, three hundred thousand men.\r\n\r\n6. Hence he proceeded through Syria, one day's march, five parasangs, to\r\nMyriandrus, a city near the sea, inhabited by Phœnicians; this place\r\nwas a public mart, and many merchant-vessels lay at anchor there. 7.\r\nHere they remained seven days; and here Xenias the Arcadian captain, and\r\nPasion the Megarean, embarking in a vessel, and putting on board their\r\nmost valuable effects, sailed away; being actuated, as most thought, by\r\nmotives of jealousy, because Cyrus had allowed Clearchus to retain under\r\nhis command their soldiers, who had seceded to Clearchus in the\r\nexpectation of returning to Greece, and not of marching against the\r\nking. Upon their disappearance, a rumour pervaded the army that Cyrus\r\nwould pursue them with ships of war; and some wished that they might be\r\ntaken, as having acted perfidiously; while others pitied their fate, if\r\nthey should be caught.\r\n\r\n8. But Cyrus, calling together the captains, said to them, \"Xenias and\r\nPasion have left us: but let them be well assured, that they have not\r\nfled clandestinely; for I know which way they are gone; nor have they\r\nescaped beyond my reach; for I have triremes that would overtake their\r\nvessel. But, by the gods, I shall certainly not pursue them; nor shall\r\nany one say, that as long as a man remains with me, I make use of his\r\nservices, but that, when he desires to leave me, I seize and ill-treat\r\nhis person, and despoil him of his property. But let them go, with the\r\nconsciousness that they have acted a worse part towards us than we\r\ntowards them. I have, indeed, their children and wives under guard at\r\nTralles; but not even of them shall they be deprived, but shall receive\r\nthem back in consideration of their former service to me.\" 9. Thus Cyrus\r\nspoke; and the Greeks, even such as had been previously disinclined to\r\nthe expedition, when they heard of the noble conduct of Cyrus,\r\naccompanied him with greater pleasure and alacrity.\r\n\r\nAfter these occurrences, Cyrus proceeded four days' march, a distance of\r\ntwenty parasangs, to the river Chalus, which is a plethrum in breadth,\r\nand full of large tame fish, which the Syrians looked upon as gods, and\r\nallowed no one to hurt either them or the pigeons. The villages, in\r\nwhich they fixed their quarters, belonged to Parysatis, having been\r\ngiven her for her girdle.[42]\r\n\r\n10. Thence he advanced, five days' march, a distance of thirty\r\nparasangs, to the source of the river Dardes, which is a plethrum in\r\nbreadth. Here was the palace of Belesys, the governor of Syria, and a\r\nvery large and beautiful garden, containing all that the seasons\r\nproduce. But Cyrus laid it waste, and burned the palace.\r\n\r\n11. Hence he proceeded, three days' march, a distance of fifteen\r\nparasangs, to the river Euphrates, which is there four stadia in\r\nbreadth, and on which is situated a large and rich city, named\r\nThapsacus. The army remained there five days; and Cyrus sent for the\r\nGreek captains, and told them, that his march was directed to Babylon,\r\nagainst the Great King; and he desired them to make this announcement to\r\nthe soldiers, and to persuade them to accompany him.\r\n\r\n12. The leaders, assembling their troops, communicated this information\r\nto them; and the soldiers expressed themselves much displeased with\r\ntheir officers, and said that they had long known this, but concealed\r\nit; and they refused to go, unless such a donative was granted them, as\r\nhad been given to those who had before gone up with Cyrus to his father,\r\nand that, too, when they did not go to fight, but merely attended Cyrus\r\nwhen his father summoned him. 13. This state of things the generals\r\nreported to Cyrus; who in consequence promised to give every man five\r\nminæ of silver,[43] when they should arrive at Babylon, and their full\r\npay besides, until he should bring back the Greeks to Ionia again. The\r\ngreatest part of the Grecian force was thus prevailed upon to accompany\r\nhim. But before it was certain what the other soldiers would do, whether\r\nthey would accompany Cyrus or not, Menon assembled his own troops apart\r\nfrom the rest, and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n14. \"If you will follow my advice, soldiers, you will, without incurring\r\neither danger or toil, make yourselves honoured by Cyrus beyond the rest\r\nof the army. What, then, would I have you do? Cyrus is at this moment\r\nurgent with the Greeks to accompany him against the king; I therefore\r\nsuggest that, before it is known how the other Greeks will answer Cyrus,\r\nyou should cross over the river Euphrates. 15. For if they should\r\ndetermine upon accompanying him, you will appear to have been the cause\r\nof it, by being the first to pass the river; and to you, as being most\r\nforward with your services, Cyrus will feel and repay the obligation, as\r\nno one knows how to do better than himself. But if the others should\r\ndetermine not to go with him, we shall all of us return back again; but\r\nyou, as having alone complied with his wishes, and as being most worthy\r\nof his confidence, he will employ in garrison duty and posts of\r\nauthority; and whatever else you may ask of him, I feel assured that, as\r\nthe friends of Cyrus, you will obtain it.\"\r\n\r\n16. On hearing these proposals, they at once complied with them, and\r\ncrossed the river before the others had given their answer. And when\r\nCyrus perceived that they had crossed, he was much pleased, and\r\ndespatched Glus to Menon's troops with this message: \"I applaud your\r\nconduct, my friends; and it shall be my care that you may applaud me; or\r\nthink me no longer Cyrus.\" 17. The soldiers, in consequence, being\r\nfilled with great expectations, prayed that he might succeed; and to\r\nMenon Cyrus was said to have sent most magnificent presents. After these\r\ntransactions, he passed the river, and all the rest of the army followed\r\nhim; and, in crossing the stream, no one was wetted by its waters above\r\nthe breast. 18. The people of Thapsacus said, that this river had never,\r\nexcept on that occasion, been passable on foot, but only by means of\r\nboats; which Abrocomas, going before, had burnt, that Cyrus might not be\r\nable to cross. It seemed, therefore, that this had happened by divine\r\ninterposition, and that the river had plainly made way for Cyrus as the\r\nfuture king.\r\n\r\n19. Hence he advanced through Syria, nine days' march, a distance of\r\nfifty parasangs, and arrived at the river Araxes, where were a number of\r\nvillages, stored with corn and wine. Here the army remained three days,\r\nand collected provisions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Ἦσαν δὲ ταῦτα δύο τείχη.] As the fem. πύλαι precedes, and\r\nas the gates were not properly the τείχη, but the space between them,\r\nWeiske conjectures ἦσαν δὲ ἐνταῦθα, κ. τ. λ., which Kühner and others\r\napprove, but have not admitted into the text. Kühner interprets τείχη\r\n\"castella,\" and I have followed him. When Xenophon speaks, a little\r\nbelow, of τείχη εἰς τὴν θάλατταν καθήκοντα, he seems to mean _walls_\r\nattached to the fortress nearest to the sea. So when he says that _at\r\neach of the fortresses_, ἐπὶ τοῖς τείχεσιν ἀμφοτέροις, were gates, he\r\nappears to signify that there were gates in the walls attached to each\r\nof the fortresses. \"At a distance of about six hundred yards,\r\ncorresponding with the three stadia of Xenophon, are the ruins of a\r\nwall, which can be traced amid a dense shrubbery, from the mountains\r\ndown to the sea-shore, where it terminates in a round tower.\"\r\n_Ainsworth_, p. 59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: \"That is, within the two fortresses and beyond them, viz.\r\nin Syria.\" _Kühner_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Εἰς ζώνην.] Nominally to furnish her with girdles, or to\r\nsupply ornaments for her girdle, it being the custom with the Persian\r\nkings to bestow places on their queens and other favourites ostensibly\r\nfor the purpose of furnishing them with articles of dress, food, or\r\nother conveniences.

They suffer from want of provisions, and many of the beasts\r\n     of burden perish; but supplies are procured from the opposite bank\r\n     of the Euphrates. A dispute occurs between Clearchus and Menon,\r\n     which is quelled by Cyrus.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Cyrus now advanced through Arabia, having the Euphrates on his right,\r\nfive days' march through the desert, a distance of thirty-five\r\nparasangs. In this region the ground was entirely a plain, level as the\r\nsea. It was covered with wormwood, and whatever other kinds of shrub or\r\nreed grew on it, were all odoriferous as perfumes. But there were no\r\ntrees. 2. There were wild animals, however, of various kinds; the most\r\nnumerous were wild asses; there were also many ostriches, as well as\r\nbustards and antelopes; and these animals the horsemen of the army\r\nsometimes hunted. The wild asses, when any one pursued them, would start\r\nforward a considerable distance, and then stand still; (for they ran\r\nmuch more swiftly than the horse;) and again, when the horse approached,\r\nthey did the same; and it was impossible to catch them, unless the\r\nhorsemen, stationing themselves at intervals, kept up the pursuit with a\r\nsuccession of horses. The flesh of those that were taken resembled\r\nvenison, but was more tender. 3. An ostrich no one succeeded in\r\ncatching; and those horsemen who hunted that bird, soon desisted from\r\nthe pursuit; for it far outstripped[44] them in its flight, using its\r\nfeet for running, and its wings, raising them like a sail.[45] The\r\nbustards might be taken, if a person started them suddenly; for they fly\r\nbut a short distance, like partridges, and soon tire. Their flesh was\r\nvery delicious.\r\n\r\n4. Marching through this region, they came to the river Mascas, the\r\nbreadth of which is a plethrum. Here was a large deserted city, of which\r\nthe name was Corsote, and which was entirely surrounded by the Mascas.\r\nHere they stayed three days, and furnished themselves with provisions.\r\n\r\n5. Thence he proceeded, thirteen days' march through the desert, a\r\ndistance of ninety parasangs, still keeping the Euphrates on the right,\r\nand arrived at a place called the Gates.[46] In this march many of the\r\nbeasts of burden perished of hunger; for there was neither grass, nor\r\nany sort of tree, but the whole country was completely bare. The\r\ninhabitants, who quarried and fashioned millstones near the river, took\r\nthem to Babylon, and sold them, and lived upon corn which they bought\r\nwith the money. 6. Corn, too, failed the army, and it was not possible\r\nto buy any, except in the Lydian market among Cyrus's Barbarian troops,\r\nwhere they purchased a capithe[47] of wheat-flour or barley-meal for\r\nfour sigli. The siglus is equivalent to seven Attic oboli and a\r\nhalf,[48] and the capithe contains two Attic chœnices. The soldiers\r\ntherefore lived entirely upon flesh.\r\n\r\n7. There were some of these marches which he made extremely long,\r\nwhenever he wished to get to water or forage. On one occasion, when a\r\nnarrow and muddy road presented itself, almost impassable for the\r\nwaggons, Cyras halted on the spot with the most distinguished and\r\nwealthy of his train, and ordered Glus and Pigres, with a detachment of\r\nthe Barbarian forces, to assist in extricating the waggons. 8. But as\r\nthey appeared to him to do this too tardily, he ordered, as if in anger,\r\nthe noblest Persians of his suite to assist in expediting the carriages.\r\nThen might be seen a specimen of their ready obedience; for, throwing\r\noff their purple cloaks, in the place where each happened to be\r\nstanding, they rushed forward, as one would run in a race for victory,\r\ndown an extremely steep declivity, having on those rich vests which they\r\nwear, and embroidered trowsers, some too with chains about their necks\r\nand bracelets on their wrists, and, leaping with these equipments\r\nstraight into the mud, brought the waggons up quicker than any one would\r\nhave imagined.\r\n\r\n9. On the whole, Cyrus evidently used the greatest speed throughout the\r\nmarch, and made no delay, except where he halted in order to obtain a\r\nsupply of provisions, or for some other necessary purpose; thinking that\r\nthe quicker he went, the more unprepared he should find the king when he\r\nengaged him, and that the more slowly he proceeded, the more numerous\r\nwould be the force collected by the king. And an attentive observer\r\nmight see that the empire of the king was strong indeed in extent of\r\nterritory and number of inhabitants, but weak through the length of the\r\nroads, and the dispersion of its forces, if an enemy invaded it with\r\nrapid movements.\r\n\r\n10. On the other side of the Euphrates, over against their course\r\nthrough the desert, was an opulent and extensive city, called Charmande;\r\nfrom this place the soldiers purchased provisions, crossing the river on\r\nrafts in the following manner. They filled the skins, which they had for\r\nthe coverings of their tents,[49] with dry hay, and then closed and\r\nstitched them together, so that the water could not touch the hay. Upon\r\nthese they went across, and procured necessaries, such as wine made of\r\nthe fruit of the palm-tree, and panic[50] corn; for this was most\r\nplentiful in those parts. 11. Here the soldiers of Menon and those of\r\nClearchus falling into a dispute about something, Clearchus, judging a\r\nsoldier of Menon's to be in the wrong, inflicted stripes upon him, and\r\nthe man, coming to the quarters of his own troops, told his comrades\r\nwhat had occurred, who, when they heard it, showed great displeasure and\r\nresentment towards Clearchus. 12. On the same day, Clearchus, after\r\ngoing to the place where the river was crossed, and inspecting the\r\nmarket there, was returning on horseback to his tent through Menon's\r\ncamp, with a few attendants. Cyrus had not yet arrived, but was still on\r\nhis way thither. One of Menon's soldiers, who was employed in cleaving\r\nwood, when he saw Clearchus riding through the camp, threw his axe at\r\nhim, but missed his aim; another then threw a stone at him, and another,\r\nand afterwards several, a great uproar ensuing. 13. Clearchus sought\r\nrefuge in his own camp, and immediately called his men to arms, ordering\r\nhis heavy-armed troops to remain on the spot, resting their shields\r\nagainst their knees, while he himself, with the Thracians, and the\r\nhorsemen that were in his camp, to the number of more than forty, (and\r\nmost of these were Thracians,) bore down towards the troops of Menon, so\r\nthat they and Menon himself were struck with terror, and made a general\r\nrush to their arms; while some stood still, not knowing how to act under\r\nthe circumstances. 14. Proxenus happened then to be coming up behind the\r\nrest, with a body of heavy-armed men following him, and immediately led\r\nhis troops into the middle space between them both, and drew them up\r\nunder arms, begging Clearchus to desist from what he was doing. But\r\nClearchus was indignant, because, when he had narrowly escaped stoning,\r\nProxenus spoke mildly of the treatment that he had received; he\r\naccordingly desired him to stand out from between them.\r\n\r\n15. At this juncture Cyrus came up, and inquired into the affair. He\r\nthen instantly took his javelins in his hand, and rode, with such of his\r\nconfidential officers as were with him, into the midst of the Greeks,\r\nand addressed them thus: 16. \"Clearchus and Proxenus, and you other\r\nGreeks who are here present, you know not what you are doing. For if you\r\nengage in any contention with one another, be assured, that this very\r\nday I shall be cut off, and you also not long after me; since, if our\r\naffairs go ill, all these Barbarians, whom you see before you, will\r\nprove more dangerous enemies to us than even those who are with the\r\nking.\" 17. Clearchus, on hearing these remonstrances, recovered his\r\nself-possession; and both parties, desisting from the strife, deposited\r\ntheir arms in their respective encampments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Απεσπᾶτο.] \"Drew itself away from\" its pursuers. There are\r\nvarious readings of this word. Kühner adopts ἀπεσπα, in the sense of\r\n\"drew off its pursuers from the rest of the huntsmen.\" Bornemann reads\r\nἀπέπτατο.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: It would be needless to repeat all that has been said as\r\nto the construction of this passage; I have adopted the explication of\r\nKühner.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Επὶ Πύλας.] A strait or defile through which the road lay\r\nfrom Mesopotamia into Babylonia; hence called the _Pylæ Babyloniæ_.

See Arrian, iii.\r\n29. This mode of crossing rivers, we learn from Dr. Layard, is still\r\npractised in Armenia both by men and women.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: See note on i. 2. 22.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     Traces of the king's troops are perceived. Orontes, a Persian\r\n     nobleman, a relation of Cyrus, offers to go forward with a body of\r\n     cavalry, and lay an ambush for the king's army. Before he sets out,\r\n     however, he is found to be in correspondence with the king, and is\r\n     put to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. As they advanced from this place, the footsteps and dung of horses\r\nwere observed, and the track was conjectured to be that of about two\r\nthousand cavalry. These, as they went before, had burnt all the fodder,\r\nand whatever else might have been of use to Cyrus. And here Orontes, a\r\nPersian, by birth connected with the king, and reckoned one of the\r\nablest of the Persians in the field, turned traitor to Cyrus; with whom,\r\nindeed, he had previously been at strife, but had been reconciled to\r\nhim. 2. He now told Cyrus, that if he would give him a thousand horse,\r\nhe would either cut off, by lying in ambush, the body of cavalry that\r\nwere burning all before them, or would take the greater number of them\r\nprisoners, and hinder them from consuming everything in their way, and\r\nprevent them from ever informing the king that they had seen the army of\r\nCyrus. Cyrus, when he heard his proposal, thought it advantageous; and\r\ndesired him to take a certain number of men from each of the different\r\ncommanders.\r\n\r\n3. Orontes, thinking that he had secured the cavalry, wrote a letter to\r\nthe king, saying that he would come to him with as many horse as he\r\ncould obtain; and he desired him to give directions to his own cavalry\r\nto receive him as a friend. There were also in the letter expressions\r\nreminding the king of his former friendship and fidelity to him. This\r\nletter he gave to a man, upon whom, as he believed, he could depend, but\r\nwho, when he received it, carried it to Cyrus. 4. Cyrus, after reading\r\nthe letter, caused Orontes to be arrested, and summoned to his own tent\r\nseven of the most distinguished Persians of his staff, and desired the\r\nGreek generals to bring up a body of heavy-armed men, who should arrange\r\nthemselves under arms around his tent. They did as he desired, and\r\nbrought with them about three thousand heavy-armed soldiers. 5.\r\nClearchus he called in to assist at the council, as that officer\r\nappeared, both to himself and to the rest, to be held most in honour\r\namong the Greeks. Afterwards, when Clearchus left the council, he\r\nrelated to his friends how the trial of Orontes was conducted; for there\r\nwas no injunction of secrecy. He said, that Cyrus thus opened the\r\nproceedings:\r\n\r\n6. \"I have solicited your attendance, my friends, in order that, on\r\nconsulting with you, I may do, with regard to Orontes here before you,\r\nwhatever may be thought just before gods and men. In the first place,\r\nthen, my father appointed him to be subject to me. And when afterwards,\r\nby the command, as he himself states, of my brother, he engaged in war\r\nagainst me, having possession of the citadel of Sardis, I, too, took up\r\narms against him, and made him resolve to desist from war with me; and\r\nthen I received from him, and gave him in return, the right-hand of\r\nfriendship. 7. And since that occurrence,\" he continued, \"is there\r\nanything in which I have wronged you?\" Orontes replied that there was\r\nnot. Cyrus again asked him, \"And did you not then subsequently, when, as\r\nyou own yourself, you had received no injury from me, go over to the\r\nMysians, and do all the mischief in your power to my territories?\"\r\nOrontes answered in the affirmative. \"And did you not then,\" continued\r\nCyrus, \"when you had thus again proved your strength, come to the altar\r\nof Diana, and say that you repented, and, prevailing upon me by\r\nentreaties, give me, and receive from me in return, pledges of mutual\r\nfaith?\" This, too, Orontes acknowledged. 8. \"What injury, then,\"\r\ncontinued Cyrus, \"have you received from me, that you are now, for the\r\nthird time, discovered in traitorous designs against me?\" Orontes saying\r\nthat he had received no injury from him, Cyrus asked him, \"You confess,\r\nthen, that you have acted unjustly towards me?\" \"I am necessitated to\r\nconfess it,\" replied Orontes. Cyrus then again inquired, \"And would you\r\nyet become an enemy to my brother, and a faithful friend to me?\" Orontes\r\nanswered, \"Though I should become so, O Cyrus, I should no longer appear\r\nso to you.\" 9. On this, Cyrus said to those present, \"Such are this\r\nman's deeds, and such his confessions. And now, do you first, O\r\nClearchus, declare your opinion, whatever seems right to you.\" Clearchus\r\nspoke thus: \"I advise, that this man be put out of the way with all\r\ndespatch; that so it may be no longer necessary to be on our guard\r\nagainst him, but that we may have leisure, as far as he is concerned, to\r\nbenefit those who are willing to be our friends.\" 10. In this opinion,\r\nClearchus said, the rest concurred. Afterwards, by the direction of\r\nCyrus, all of them, even those related to the prisoner, rising from\r\ntheir seats, took Orontes by the girdle,[51] in token that he was to\r\nsuffer death; when those to whom directions had been given, led him\r\naway. And when those saw him pass, who had previously been used to bow\r\nbefore him, they bowed before him as usual, though they knew he was\r\nbeing led to execution.\r\n\r\n11. After he had been conducted into the tent of Artapatas, the most\r\nconfidential of Cyrus's sceptre-bearers,[52] no one from that time ever\r\nbeheld Orontes either living or dead, nor could any one say, from\r\ncertain knowledge, in what manner he died. Various conjectures were\r\nmade; but no burial-place of him was ever seen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: This was a custom among the Persians on such occasions, as\r\nis expressly signified by Diodorus Siculus, xvii. 30 in his account of\r\nthe condemnation of Charidemus, at the command of Darius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Σκηπτούχων.] \"Eunuchs, who, by the institution of Cyrus\r\nthe elder, formed the king's body-guard. See Cyrop. vii. 5. 58.\"\r\n_Zeune_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     Cyrus enters Babylonia, and reviews his troops; he addresses the\r\n     Greeks, and promises them great rewards in case of victory. He\r\n     advances in order of battle, but afterwards, supposing that his\r\n     brother had no immediate intention to engage, proceeds with less\r\n     caution.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Hence Cyrus proceeded through Babylonia, three days' march, a\r\ndistance of twelve parasangs; and at the end of the third day's march,\r\nhe reviewed his army, both Greeks and Barbarians, in the plain, about\r\nmidnight; for he expected that with the ensuing dawn the king would come\r\nup with his army to offer him battle. He desired Clearchus to take the\r\ncommand of the right wing, and Menon the Thessalian that of the left,\r\nwhile he himself drew up his own troops.\r\n\r\n2. After the review, at the dawn of day, some deserters from the Great\r\nKing came and gave Cyrus information respecting the royal army. Cyrus,\r\nassembling the generals and captains of the Greeks, consulted with them\r\nhow he should conduct the engagement, and then encouraged them with the\r\nfollowing exhortations: 3. \"It is not, O Greeks, from any want of\r\nBarbarian forces, that I take you with me as auxiliaries; but it is\r\nbecause I think you more efficient and valuable than a multitude of\r\nBarbarians, that I have engaged you in my service. See, then, that you\r\nprove yourselves worthy of the liberty of which you are possessed, and\r\nfor which I esteem you fortunate; for be well assured, that I should\r\nprefer that freedom to all that I possess, and to other possessions many\r\ntimes as great. 4. But, that you may know to what sort of encounter you\r\nare advancing, I, from my own experience, will inform you. The enemy's\r\nnumbers are immense, and they make their onset with a loud shout; but if\r\nyou are firm against this, I feel ashamed to think what sort of men, in\r\nother respects, you will find those in the country to be. But if you are\r\ntrue men, and prove yourselves stout-hearted, I will enable those of\r\nyou, who may wish to go home, to return thither the envy of their\r\nfellow-countrymen; but I think that I shall induce most of you to prefer\r\nthe advantages of remaining with me to those in your own country.\"\r\n\r\n5. Upon this, Gaulites, an exile from Samos, a man in the confidence of\r\nCyrus, being present, said, \"Yet some say, O Cyrus, that you make many\r\npromises now, because you are in such a situation of approaching danger;\r\nbut that if things should turn out well, you will not remember them;[53]\r\nand some, too, say, that even if you have both the memory and the will,\r\nyou will not have the power of bestowing all that you promise.\"\r\n\r\n6. Hearing this, Cyrus said, \"We have before us, my friends, the empire\r\nthat was my father's, extending, on the south, to the parts where men\r\ncannot live for heat; and on the north, to the parts where they cannot\r\nlive for cold; and over all that lies between these extremes, the\r\nfriends of my brother are now satraps. 7. But if we conquer, it will be\r\nproper for us to make our own friends masters of these regions. So that\r\nit is not this that I fear, that I shall not have enough to give to each\r\nof my friends, if things turn out successfully, but that I shall not\r\nhave friends enough to whom I may give it. And to each of you Greeks, I\r\nwill also give a golden crown.\"\r\n\r\n8. The Greeks who were present, when they heard these assurances, were\r\nmuch encouraged, and reported what he had said to the rest. The\r\ncaptains, too, and some others of the Greeks, went into his tent,\r\ndesiring to know for certain what would be their reward if they should\r\nbe victorious; and he did not let them go without satisfying the minds\r\nof all.\r\n\r\n9. But all, who conversed with him, urged him not to engage in the\r\nbattle personally, but take his station behind their line. About this\r\ntime, also, Clearchus put a question to Cyrus to this effect: \"And do\r\nyou think, Cyrus, that your brother will come to battle with you?\" \"By\r\nJupiter,\" replied Cyrus, \"if he be indeed the son of Darius and\r\nParysatis, and my brother, I shall not gain possession of these\r\ndominions without a struggle.\"\r\n\r\n10. In mustering the Greeks under arms, their numbers were found to be\r\nten thousand four hundred heavy-armed men, and two thousand four hundred\r\npeltasts; of Barbarian troops under Cyrus, there were one hundred\r\nthousand, with about twenty chariots armed with scythes.\r\n\r\n11. Of the enemy the number was said to be one million two hundred\r\nthousand, with two hundred scythed chariots. There were, besides, six\r\nthousand cavalry, of whom Artagerses had the command; these were drawn\r\nup in front of the king himself. 12. Of the royal army there were four\r\ncommanders, or generals, or leaders,[54] each over three hundred\r\nthousand men; that is to say, Abrocomas, Tissaphernes, Gobryas, and\r\nArbaces. But of this number only nine hundred thousand were present at\r\nthe battle, and one hundred and fifty scythed chariots; for Abrocomas,\r\nwho was marching from Phœnicia, did not arrive till five days after\r\nthe battle.\r\n\r\n13. This information was brought to Cyrus by some of the enemy who\r\ndeserted from the Great King before the battle; and such of the enemy as\r\nwere taken prisoners after the battle gave the same account.\r\n\r\n14. Hence Cyrus proceeded one day's march, a distance of three\r\nparasangs, with all his forces, as well Greek as Barbarian, drawn up in\r\norder of battle; for he expected that on this day the king would give\r\nhim battle; as about the middle of the day's march, there was a deep\r\ntrench dug; the breadth of it was five fathoms,[55] and the depth three.\r\n15. This ditch extended up through the plain, to the distance of twelve\r\nparasangs, as far as the wall of Media.[56] Here are the canals which\r\nare supplied from the river Tigris;[57] there are four of them, each a\r\nplethrum in breadth, and very deep; boats employed in conveying corn\r\nsail along them. They discharge themselves into the Euphrates, are\r\ndistant from each other one parasang, and there are bridges over them.\r\nNear the Euphrates was a narrow passage between the river and the\r\ntrench, about twenty feet in breadth. 16. This trench the Great King had\r\nmade to serve as a defence, when he heard that Cyrus was marching\r\nagainst him. By this passage Cyrus and his army made their way, and got\r\nwithin the trench.\r\n\r\n17. On this day the king did not come to an engagement, but there were\r\nto be seen many traces of men and horses in retreat.\r\n\r\n18. Cyrus sent for Silanus, the Ambracian soothsayer, and gave him three\r\nthousand darics,[58] because, on the eleventh day previous, while\r\nsacrificing, he had told Cyrus that the king would not fight for ten\r\ndays; when Cyrus exclaimed, \"He will not then fight at all, if he does\r\nnot fight within that time; but if you shall prove to have spoken truly,\r\nI promise to give you ten talents.\" This money, therefore, he now paid\r\nhim, the ten days having elapsed.\r\n\r\n19. As the king made no attempt, at the trench, to prevent the passage\r\nof Cyrus's army, it was thought both by Cyrus and the rest that he had\r\ngiven up the intention of fighting; so that on the day following Cyrus\r\nproceeded on his march with less caution. 20. On the day succeeding\r\nthat, he pursued his journey seated in his chariot, and having but a\r\nsmall body of troops in line before him; while the far greater part of\r\nthe army observed no order on their march, and many of the soldiers'\r\narms were carried on the waggons and beasts of burden.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Οὐ μεμνῆσθαι.] This is the reading in all books and\r\nmanuscripts. But a future seems to be wanted rather than a perfect.\r\nHutchinson and others render it \"te non fore memorem.\" Should we read\r\nμεμνήσεσθαι?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Ἦσαν ἄρχοντες καὶ στράτηγοι καὶ ἡγεμόνες τέτταρες.] Weiske\r\nconsiders the words καὶ στράτηγοι καὶ ἡγεμόνες spurious; and Schneider\r\nand some others are of his opinion. Kühner thinks that they are genuine,\r\nand explicative of the more general term ἄρχοντες.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Ὀργυιαί.] The ὀργυιά was equal to 6.0675 English feet. See\r\nHussey on Ancient Weights, &c., Append. sect. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Τοῦ Μηδίας τείχους.] As many of the best manuscripts have\r\nΜηδείας, in this passage as well as in ii. 4. 12, ii. 4. 27, and vii. 8.\r\n25, Kühner adopts that reading, under the notion that the wall was named\r\nfrom Medea, the wife of the last king of the Medes, whom the Persians\r\nconquered and despoiled of his dominions. \"Those who defend the reading\r\nΜηδίας,\" continues Kühner, \"suppose the name to be derived from the\r\ncountry of Media, and believe, with Mannert, (Geog. i. p. 330,) that it\r\nis the same wall which Semiramis built to defend her kingdom on the side\r\nof Media; but this opinion rests on very weak arguments.\" Ainsworth, p.\r\n180, thinks that it extended from the Tigris to the Euphrates, and that\r\nthe site of it is indicated by the ruins now called _Sidd Nimrud_, or\r\n\"the Wall of Nimrod.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: \"These canals however flowed, not from the Tigris into the\r\nEuphrates, but from the Euphrates into the Tigris, as is shown not only\r\nby Herodotus, Diodorus, Arrian, Pliny, Ammianus, but by later writers.\"\r\n_Kühner_. But \"the difference in the level of the rivers is so slight\r\nthat ---- it is probable that by merely altering the diagonal direction\r\nof a canal, the waters could be made to flow either way; certainly so at\r\ncertain seasons.\" _Ainsworth_, p. 89.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: See note on i. 1. 9.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     The enemy are seen advancing in order of battle, and the army of\r\n     Cyrus hastily prepare for action. The Greeks, in the right wing,\r\n     put to flight the troops opposed to them, and pursue them some\r\n     distance. Cyrus, in the centre, directs his attack against the\r\n     king, and is killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It was now about the time of full market,[59] and the station, where\r\nhe intended to halt, was not far off, when Pategyas, a Persian, one of\r\nCyrus's confidential adherents, made his appearance, riding at his\r\nutmost speed, with his horse in a sweat, and straightway called out to\r\nall whom he met, both in Persian and Greek, \"that the king was\r\napproaching with a vast army, prepared as for battle.\" 2. Immediately\r\ngreat confusion ensued; for the Greeks and all the rest imagined that he\r\nwould fall upon them suddenly, before they could form their ranks; 3.\r\nand Cyrus, leaping from his chariot, put on his breastplate, and,\r\nmounting his horse, took his javelin in his hand, and gave orders for\r\nall the rest to arm themselves, and to take their stations each in his\r\nown place. 4. They accordingly formed with all expedition; Clearchus\r\noccupying the extremity of the right wing close to the Euphrates,\r\nProxenus being next to him, and after him the other captains in\r\nsuccession. Menon and his troops occupied the left wing of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n5. Of the Barbarian forces, about one thousand Paphlagonian cavalry were\r\nstationed near Clearchus, and the Grecian peltasts on the right; and on\r\nthe left was Ariæus, Cyrus's lieutenant, with the rest of the Barbarian\r\ntroops. 6. In the centre[60] was Cyrus, and with him about six hundred\r\ncavalry, the men all armed with breastplates, defences for the thighs,\r\nand helmets, except Cyrus alone; for Cyrus presented himself for battle\r\nwith his head unprotected. [It is said, too, that the other Persians\r\nexpose themselves in battle with their heads uncovered.][61]\r\n\r\n7. All the horses of the cavalry, that were with Cyrus, had defensive\r\narmour on the forehead and breast; and the horsemen had also Grecian\r\nswords.\r\n\r\n8. It was now mid-day, and the enemy was not yet in sight. But when it\r\nwas afternoon,[62] there appeared a dust, like a white cloud, and not\r\nlong after, a sort of blackness, extending to a great distance over the\r\nplain. Presently, as they approached nearer, brazen armour began to\r\nflash, and the spears and ranks became visible. 9. There was a body of\r\ncavalry, in white armour, on the left of the enemy's line; (Tissaphernes\r\nwas said to have the command of them;) close by these were troops with\r\nwicker shields; and next to them, heavy-armed soldiers with long wooden\r\nshields reaching to their feet; (these were said to be Egyptians;) then\r\nother cavalry and bowmen. These all marched according to their nations,\r\neach nation separately in a solid oblong.[63] 10. In front of their\r\nline, at considerable intervals from each other, were stationed the\r\nchariots called scythed chariots; they had scythes projecting obliquely\r\nfrom the axletree, and others under the driver's seat, pointing to the\r\nearth, for the purpose of cutting through whatever came in their way;\r\nand the design of them was to penetrate and divide the ranks of the\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\n11. As to what Cyrus had said, however, when, on calling together the\r\nGreeks, he exhorted them to sustain unmoved the shout of the Barbarians,\r\nhe was in this respect deceived; for they now approached, not with a\r\nshout, but with all possible silence, and quietly, with an even and slow\r\nstep. 12. Cyrus in the mean time, riding by with Pigres the interpreter,\r\nand three or four others, called out to Clearchus to lead his troops\r\nagainst the enemy's centre, for that there was the king; \"and if,\" said\r\nhe, \"we are victorious in that quarter, our object is fully\r\naccomplished.\" 13. But though Clearchus saw that close collection of\r\ntroops in the centre of the enemy's line, and heard from Cyrus that the\r\nking was beyond the left of the Greeks, (for so much the superior was\r\nthe king in numbers, that, while occupying the middle of his own line,\r\nhe was still beyond Cyrus's left,) nevertheless, he was unwilling to\r\ndraw off his right wing from the river, fearing lest he should be hemmed\r\nin on both sides; and in answer to Cyrus he said, \"that he would take\r\ncare that all should go well.\"\r\n\r\n14. During this time the Barbarian army advanced with a uniform pace;\r\nand the Grecian line, still remaining in the same place, was gradually\r\nforming from those who came up from time to time. Cyrus, riding by at a\r\nmoderate distance from his army,[64] surveyed from thence both the\r\nlines, looking as well towards the enemy as to his own men. 15.\r\nXenophon, an Athenian, perceiving him from the Grecian line, rode up to\r\nmeet him, and inquired whether he had any commands; when Cyrus stopped\r\nhis horse, and told him, and desired him to tell everybody, that the\r\nsacrifices and the appearances of the victims were favourable.[65] 16.\r\nAs he was saying this, he heard a murmur passing through the ranks, and\r\nasked what noise that was. He answered,[66] \"that it was the watchword,\r\npassing now for the second time.\"[67] At which Cyrus wondered who had\r\ngiven it, and asked what the word was. He replied that it was, \"JUPITER\r\nTHE PRESERVER and VICTORY.\" 17. When Cyrus heard it, \"I accept it as a\r\ngood omen,\" said he, \"and let it be so.\" Saying this, he rode away to\r\nhis own station; and the two armies were now not more than three or four\r\nstadia distant from each other, when the Greeks sang the pæan, and began\r\nto march forward to meet the enemy. 18. And as, while they proceeded,\r\nsome part of their body fluctuated out of line,[68] those who were thus\r\nleft behind began to run: and at the same time, they all raised just\r\nsuch a shout as they usually raise to Mars, and the whole of them took\r\nto a running pace. Some say, that they made a noise with their spears\r\nagainst their shields, to strike terror into the horses. 19. But the\r\nBarbarians, before an arrow could reach them, gave way, and took to\r\nflight. The Greeks then pursued them with all their force, calling out\r\nto each other, not to run, but to follow in order. 20. The chariots,\r\nabandoned by their drivers, were hurried, some through the midst of the\r\nenemies themselves, and others through the midst of the Greeks. The\r\nGreeks, when they saw them coming, opened their ranks to let them pass;\r\nsome few, however, were startled and caught by them, as might happen in\r\na race-course; but these, they said, suffered no material injury; nor\r\ndid any other of the Greeks receive any hurt in this battle, except\r\nthat, on the left of their army, a man was said to have been shot with\r\nan arrow.\r\n\r\n21. Cyrus, though he saw the Greeks victorious, and pursuing those of\r\nthe enemies who were opposed to them, and though he felt great pleasure\r\nat the sight, and was already saluted as king by those about him, was\r\nnot, however, led away to join in the pursuit; but keeping the band of\r\nsix hundred cavalry, that were with him, drawn up in close order around\r\nhim, he attentively watched how the king would proceed; for he well knew\r\nthat he occupied the centre of the Persian army. 22. All the commanders\r\nof the Barbarians, indeed, lead[69] their troops to battle occupying the\r\ncentre of their own men; thinking that they will thus be most secure, if\r\nthey have the strength of their force on either side of them, and that\r\nif they have occasion to issue orders, their army will receive them in\r\nhalf the time. 23. On the present occasion, the king, though he occupied\r\nthe centre of his own army, was nevertheless beyond Cyrus's left wing.\r\nBut as no enemy attacked him in front, or the troops that were drawn up\r\nbefore him, he began to wheel round, as if to enclose his adversaries.\r\n24. Cyrus, in consequence, fearing that he might take the Greeks in the\r\nrear, and cut them in pieces, moved directly upon him, and charging with\r\nhis six hundred horse, routed the troops that were stationed in front of\r\nthe king, and put the guard of six thousand to flight, and is said to\r\nhave killed with his own hand Artagerses, their commander.\r\n\r\n25. When this flight of the enemy took place, Cyrus's six hundred became\r\ndispersed in the eagerness of pursuit; only a very few remaining with\r\nhim, chiefly those who were called \"partakers of his table.\"\r\n\r\n26. While accompanied by these, he perceived the king and the close\r\nguard around him; when he immediately lost his self-command, and\r\nexclaiming, \"I see the man,\" rushed upon him, struck him on the breast,\r\nand wounded him through the breastplate, as Ctesias, the physician,\r\nrelates, stating that he himself dressed the wound. 27. As Cyrus was in\r\nthe act of striking, some one hit him violently with a javelin under the\r\neye; and how many of those about the king were killed, (while they thus\r\nfought, the king, and Cyrus, and their respective followers in defence\r\nof each,) Ctesias relates; for he was with him; on the other side, Cyrus\r\nhimself was killed, and eight of his principal officers lay dead upon\r\nhis body. 28. Artapates, the most faithful servant to him of all his\r\nsceptre-bearers,[70] when he saw Cyrus fall, is said to have leaped from\r\nhis horse, and thrown himself upon the body of his master; 29. and some\r\nsay, that the king ordered some one to kill him on the body of Cyrus;\r\nbut others relate, that he drew his scimitar, and killed himself upon\r\nthe body; for he had a golden scimitar by his side, and also wore a\r\nchain and bracelets, and other ornaments, like the noblest of the\r\nPersians; since he was honoured by Cyrus for his attachment and fidelity\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Ἀμφὶ ἀγορὰν πλήθουσαν.] The time from the tenth hour till\r\nnoon.

But as it would thus be passed\r\nonly twice, not oftener, it would appear that we should read τὸ\r\nδεύτερον. _Krüger_ de Authen. Anab. p. 33. Kühner observes that the\r\narticle is not absolutely necessary. I have translated \"_the_ second\r\ntime,\" as the sense seems to require. Some have imagined that the word\r\nδεύτερον implies that _a second watchword_, another given out for the\r\noccasion, was passing round; but for this supposition there seems no\r\nground.

All his personal friends are killed, except\r\n     Ariæus, who takes to flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Thus then died Cyrus; a man who, of all the Persians since Cyrus the\r\nelder, was the most princely and most worthy of empire, as is agreed by\r\nall who appear to have had personal knowledge of him. 2. In the first\r\nplace, while he was yet a boy, and when he was receiving his education\r\nwith his brother and the other youths, he was thought to surpass them\r\nall in everything. 3. For all the sons of the Persian nobles are\r\neducated at the gates of the king;[71] where they may learn many a\r\nlesson of virtuous conduct, but can see or hear nothing disgraceful. 4.\r\nHere the boys see some honoured by the king, and others disgraced, and\r\nhear of them; so that in their very childhood they learn to govern and\r\nto obey.\r\n\r\n5. Here Cyrus, first of all, showed himself most remarkable for modesty\r\namong those of his own age, and for paying more ready obedience to his\r\nelders than even those who were inferior to him in station; and next, he\r\nwas noted for his fondness for horses, and for managing them in a\r\nsuperior manner. They found him, too, very desirous of learning, and\r\nmost assiduous in practising, the warlike exercises of archery, and\r\nhurling the javelin. 6. When it suited his age, he grew extremely fond\r\nof the chase, and of braving dangers in encounters with wild beasts. On\r\none occasion, he did not shrink from a she-bear that attacked him, but,\r\nin grappling with her, was dragged from off his horse, and received some\r\nwounds, the scars of which were visible on his body, but at last killed\r\nher. The person who first came to his assistance, he made a happy man in\r\nthe eyes of many.\r\n\r\n7. When he was sent down by his father, as satrap of Lydia and Great\r\nPhrygia and Cappadocia, and was also appointed commander of all the\r\ntroops whose duty it is to muster in the plain of Castolus, he soon\r\nshowed that if he made a league or compact with any one, or gave a\r\npromise, he deemed it of the utmost importance not to break his word. 8.\r\nAccordingly the states that were committed to his charge, as well as\r\nindividuals, had the greatest confidence in him; and if any one had been\r\nhis enemy, he felt secure that if Cyrus entered into a treaty with him,\r\nhe should suffer no infraction of the stipulations. 9. When, therefore,\r\nhe waged war against Tissaphernes, all the cities, of their own accord,\r\nchose to adhere to Cyrus in preference to Tissaphernes, except the\r\nMilesians; but they feared him, because he would not abandon the cause\r\nof the exiles; 10. for he both showed by his deeds, and declared in\r\nwords, that he would never desert them, since he had once become a\r\nfriend to them, not even though they should grow still fewer in number,\r\nand be in a worse condition than they were.\r\n\r\n11. Whenever any one did him a kindness or an injury, he showed himself\r\nanxious to go beyond him in those respects; and some used to mention a\r\nwish of his, that \"he desired to live long enough to outdo both those\r\nwho had done him good, and those who had done him ill, in the requital\r\nthat he should make.\" 12. Accordingly to him alone of the men of our\r\ndays were so great a number of people desirous of committing the\r\ndisposal of their property, their cities, and their own persons.\r\n\r\n13. Yet no one could with truth say this of him, that he suffered the\r\ncriminal or unjust to deride his authority; for he of all men inflicted\r\npunishment most unsparingly; and there were often to be seen, along the\r\nmost frequented roads, men deprived of their feet, or hands, or eyes; so\r\nthat in Cyrus's dominions, it was possible for any one, Greek or\r\nBarbarian, who did no wrong, to travel without fear whithersoever he\r\npleased, and having with him whatever might suit his convenience.\r\n\r\n14. To those who showed ability for war, it is acknowledged that he paid\r\ndistinguished honour. His first war was with the Pisidians and Mysians;\r\nand, marching in person into these countries, he made those, whom he saw\r\nvoluntarily hazarding their lives in his service, governors over the\r\nterritory that he subdued, and distinguished them with rewards in other\r\nways. 15. So that the brave appeared to be the most fortunate of men,\r\nwhile the cowardly were deemed fit[72] only to be their slaves. There\r\nwere, therefore, great numbers of persons who voluntarily exposed\r\nthemselves to danger, wherever they thought that Cyrus would become\r\naware of their exertions.\r\n\r\n16. With regard to justice, if any appeared to him inclined to display\r\nthat virtue, he made a point of making such men richer than those who\r\nsought to profit by injustice. 17. Accordingly, while in many other\r\nrespects his affairs were administered judiciously, he likewise\r\npossessed an army worthy of the name. For it was not for money that\r\ngenerals and captains came from foreign lands to enter into his service,\r\nbut because they were persuaded that to serve Cyrus well, would be more\r\nprofitable than any amount of monthly pay. 18. Besides, if any one\r\nexecuted his orders in a superior manner, he never suffered his\r\ndiligence to go unrewarded; consequently, in every undertaking, the best\r\nqualified officers were said to be ready to assist him.\r\n\r\n19. If he noticed any one that was a skilful manager, with strict regard\r\nto justice, stocking the land of which he had the direction, and\r\nsecuring income from it, he would never take anything from such a\r\nperson, but was ever ready to give him something in addition; so that\r\nmen laboured with cheerfulness, acquired property with confidence, and\r\nmade no concealment from Cyrus of what each possessed; for he did not\r\nappear to envy those who amassed riches openly, but to endeavour to\r\nbring into use the wealth of those who concealed it.\r\n\r\n20. Whatever friends he made, and felt to be well-disposed to him, and\r\nconsidered to be capable of assisting him in anything that he might wish\r\nto accomplish, he is acknowledged by all to have been most successful in\r\nattaching them to him. 21. For, on the very same account on which he\r\nthought that he himself had need of friends, namely, that he might have\r\nco-operators in his undertakings, did he endeavour to prove an efficient\r\nassistant to his friends in whatever he perceived any of them desirous\r\nof effecting.\r\n\r\n22. He received, for many reasons, more presents than perhaps any other\r\nsingle individual; and these he outdid every one else in distributing\r\namongst his friends, having a view to the character of each, and to what\r\nhe perceived each most needed. 23. Whatever presents any one sent him of\r\narticles of personal ornament, whether for warlike accoutrement, or\r\nmerely for dress, concerning these, they said, he used to remark, that\r\nhe could not decorate his own person with them all, but that he thought\r\nfriends well equipped were the greatest ornament a man could have. 24.\r\nThat he should outdo his friends, indeed, in conferring great benefits,\r\nis not at all wonderful, since he was so much more able; but, that he\r\nshould surpass his friends in kind attentions, and an anxious desire to\r\noblige, appears to me far more worthy of admiration. 25. Frequently,\r\nwhen he had wine served him of a peculiarly fine flavour, he would send\r\nhalf-emptied flagons of it to some of his friends, with a message to\r\nthis effect: \"Cyrus has not for some time met with pleasanter wine than\r\nthis; and he has therefore sent some of it to you, and begs you will\r\ndrink it to-day, with those whom you love best.\" 26. He would often,\r\ntoo, send geese partly eaten, and the halves of loaves, and other such\r\nthings, desiring the bearer to say, in presenting them, \"Cyrus has been\r\ndelighted with these, and therefore wishes you also to taste of them.\"\r\n\r\n27. Wherever provender was scarce, but he himself, from having many\r\nattendants, and from the care which he took, was able to procure some,\r\nhe would send it about, and desire his friends to give that provender to\r\nthe horses that carried them, so that hungry steeds might not carry his\r\nfriends. 28. Whenever he rode out, and many were likely to see him, he\r\nwould call to him his friends, and hold earnest conversation with them,\r\nthat he might show whom he held in honour; so that, from what I have\r\nheard, I should think that no one was ever beloved by a greater number\r\nof persons, either Greeks or Barbarians. 29. Of this fact the following\r\nis a proof; that no one deserted to the king from Cyrus, though only a\r\nsubject, (except that Orontes attempted to do so; but he soon found the\r\nperson whom he believed faithful to him, more a friend to Cyrus than to\r\nhimself,) while many came over to Cyrus from the king, after they became\r\nenemies to each other; and these, too, men who were greatly beloved by\r\nthe king; for they felt persuaded, that if they proved themselves brave\r\nsoldiers under Cyrus, they would obtain from him more adequate rewards\r\nfor their services than from the king.\r\n\r\n30. What occurred also at the time of his death, is a great proof, as\r\nwell that he himself was a man of merit, as that he could accurately\r\ndistinguish such as were trust-worthy, well disposed, and constant in\r\ntheir attachment. 31. For when he was killed, all his friends, and the\r\npartakers of his table who were with him, fell fighting in his defence,\r\nexcept Ariæus, who had been posted, in command of the cavalry, on the\r\nleft; and, when he learned that Cyrus had fallen in the battle, he took\r\nto flight, with all the troops which he had under his command.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Ἐπὶ ταῖς βασιλέως θύραις.] For \"at the king's palace.\"\r\n\"The king's palace was styled among the ancient Persians, as in the\r\nmodern Constantinople, _the Porte_. Agreeably to the customs of other\r\ndespots of the East, the kings of Persia resided in the interior of\r\ntheir palaces; seldom appearing in public, and guarding all means of\r\naccess to their persons. The number of courtiers, masters of ceremonies,\r\nguards, and others was endless. It was through them alone that access\r\ncould be obtained to the monarch.\" _Heeren, Researches, &c._ vol. i. p\r\n403. See Cyrop. i. 3. 2; 2. 3, _seqq._ Corn. Nep.

Artaxerxes pursues\r\n     Ariæus, plunders the camp of Cyrus, and then returns to attack the\r\n     victorious Greeks, who put him to flight, recover what he had\r\n     seized, and return to their camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The head and right-hand of Cyrus were then cut off. The king, and the\r\ntroops that were with him, engaging in pursuit, fell upon the camp of\r\nCyrus; when the soldiers of Ariæus no longer stood their ground, but\r\nfled through their camp to the station whence they had last started;\r\nwhich was said to be four parasangs distant. 2. The king and his\r\nfollowers seized upon many other things, and also captured the Phocæan\r\nwoman, the mistress of Cyrus, who was said to be both accomplished and\r\nbeautiful. 3. His younger mistress, a native of Miletus, being taken by\r\nsome of the king's soldiers, fled for refuge, without her outer garment,\r\nto the party of Greeks,[73] who were stationed under arms to guard the\r\nbaggage, and who, drawing themselves up for defence, killed several of\r\nthe pillagers; and some of their own number also fell; yet they did not\r\nflee, but saved not only the woman, but all the rest of the property and\r\npeople that were in their quarters.\r\n\r\n4. The king and the main body of Greeks were now distant from each other\r\nabout thirty stadia, the Greeks pursuing those that had been opposed to\r\nthem, as if they had conquered all; the Persians engaged in plundering,\r\nas if they were wholly victorious. 5. But when the Greeks found that the\r\nking with his troops was amongst their baggage; and the king, on the\r\nother hand, heard from Tissaphernes, that the Greeks had routed that\r\npart of his line which had been opposed to them, and were gone forward\r\nin pursuit, the king, on his part, collected his forces, and formed\r\nthem in line again; while Clearchus, on the other side, calling to him\r\nProxenus, who happened to be nearest to him, consulted with him whether\r\nthey should send a detachment to the camp, or proceed, all of them\r\ntogether, to relieve it. 6. In the mean time, the king was observed\r\nagain approaching them, as it seemed, in their rear. The Greeks,\r\nwheeling round, prepared to receive him, in the belief that he would\r\nattack them on that quarter; the king, however, did not lead his troops\r\nthat way, but led them off by the same route by which he had before\r\npassed on the outside of their left wing; taking with him both those who\r\nhad deserted to the Greeks during the engagement, and Tissaphernes with\r\nthe troops under his command.\r\n\r\n7. Tissaphernes had not fled at the commencement of the engagement, but\r\nhad charged through the Greek peltasts, close to the banks of the river.\r\nIn breaking through, however, he killed not a single man, for the\r\nGreeks, opening their ranks, struck his men with their swords, and\r\nhurled their javelins at them. Episthenes of Amphipolis had the command\r\nof the peltasts, and was said to have proved himself an able captain. 8.\r\nTissaphernes, therefore, when he thus came off with disadvantage, did\r\nnot turn back again, but, proceeding onwards to the Grecian camp, met\r\nthe king there; and thence they now returned together, with their forces\r\nunited in battle-array. 9. When they were opposite the left wing of the\r\nGreeks, the Greeks feared lest they should attack them on that wing,\r\nand, enclosing them on both sides, should cut them off; they therefore\r\nthought it advisable to draw back this wing,[74] and to put the river in\r\ntheir rear. 10. While they were planning this manœuvre, the king,\r\nhaving passed beyond them, presented his force opposite to them, in the\r\nsame form in which he had at first come to battle; and when the Greeks\r\nsaw their enemies close at hand, and drawn up for fight, they again sang\r\nthe pæan, and advanced upon them with much greater spirit than before.\r\n11. The Barbarians, on the other hand, did not await their onset, but\r\nfled sooner[75] than at first; and the Greeks pursued them as far as a\r\ncertain village,[76] where they halted; 12. for above the village was a\r\nhill, upon which the king's troops had checked their flight, and though\r\nthere were no longer any infantry[77] there, the height was filled with\r\ncavalry; so that the Greeks could not tell what was doing. They said,\r\nthat they saw the royal standard, a golden eagle upon a spear,[78] with\r\nexpanded wings.[79]\r\n\r\n13. But as the Greeks were on the point of proceeding thither, the\r\ncavalry too left the hill; not indeed in a body, but some in one\r\ndirection and some in another; and thus the hill was gradually thinned\r\nof cavalry, till at last they were all gone. 14. Clearchus, however, did\r\nnot march up the hill, but, stationing his force at its foot, sent\r\nLycius the Syracusan and another up the hill, and ordered them, after\r\ntaking a view from the summit, to report to him what was passing on the\r\nother side. 15. Lycius accordingly rode thither, and having made his\r\nobservations, brought word that the enemy were fleeing with\r\nprecipitation. Just as these things took place, the sun set.\r\n\r\n16. Here the Greeks halted, and piling their arms, took some rest; and\r\nat the same time they wondered that Cyrus himself nowhere made his\r\nappearance, and that no one else came to them from him; for they did not\r\nknow that he was killed, but conjectured that he was either gone in\r\npursuit of the enemy, or had pushed forward to secure some post. 17.\r\nThey then deliberated whether they should remain in that spot and fetch\r\ntheir baggage thither, or return to the camp; and it was resolved to\r\nreturn, and they arrived at the tents about supper-time. 18. Such was\r\nthe conclusion of this day.\r\n\r\nThey found almost all their baggage, and whatever food and drink was\r\nwith it, plundered and wasted; the waggons, too, full of barley-meal and\r\nwine, which Cyrus had provided, in order that, if ever a great scarcity\r\nof provisions should fall upon the army, he might distribute them\r\namongst the Grecian troops, (and the waggons, as was said, were four\r\nhundred in number,) these also the king's soldiers had plundered. 19.\r\nMost of the Greeks consequently remained supperless; and they had also\r\nbeen without dinner; for before the army had halted for dinner, the king\r\nmade his appearance. In this state they passed the ensuing night.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Πρὸς τῶν Ἑλλήνων.] \"These words,\" says Kühner, \"have\r\nwonderfully exercised the abilities of commentators.\" The simplest mode\r\nof interpretation, he then observes, is to take πρὸς in the sense of\r\nversus, \"towards,\" comparing iv. 3. 26; ii. 2. 4; but he inclines, on\r\nthe whole, to make the genitive Ἑλλήνων depend on τούτους understood:\r\nἐκφεύγει τῶν Ἑλλήνων πρὸς (τούτους) οἵ ἔτυχον, κ. τ. λ., though he\r\nacknowledges that this construction is extremely forced, and that he can\r\nnowhere find anything similar to it. Brodæus suggested πρὸς τὸ τῶν\r\nἙλλήνων, scil. στρατόπεδον, and Weiske and Schneider would read πρὸς τὸ\r\nτῶν Ἑλλήνων στρατόπεδον. Other conjectures it is unnecessary to notice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Ἀναπτύσσειν.] Literally \"to fold back.\" Whether we are to\r\nunderstand that one part of the wing was drawn behind the other, is not\r\nvery clear. The commentators are not all agreed as to the exact sense\r\nthat the word ought to bear. Some would interpret it by _explicare_, \"to\r\nopen out,\" or \"extend,\" and this indeed seems more applicable to\r\nπεριπτύξαντες which precedes; for the Greeks might lengthen out their\r\nline that the king's troops might not surround them. But on the whole,\r\nthe other interpretation seems to have most voices in favour of it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Ἐκ πλέονος.] Sc. διαστήματος: they began to flee when the\r\nGreeks were at a still greater distance than before.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Μέχρι κώμης τινός.] This is generally supposed to have\r\nbeen Cunaxa, where, according to Plutarch, the battle was fought.\r\nAinsworth, p. 244, identifies Cunaxa with _Imséy'ab_, a place 36 miles\r\nnorth of Babylon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: The infantry seem to have fled; the cavalry only were\r\nleft.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Ἐπὶ πέλτης ἐπὶ ξύλου.] So stands the passage in Dindorf's\r\ntext; but most editors, from Schneider downwards, consider ἐπὶ ξύλου to\r\nbe a mere interpretation of ἐπὶ πέλτης, that has crept by some accident\r\ninto the text, and either enclose it in brackets or wholly omit it.\r\nΠέλτη is said by Hesychius and Suidas to be the same as δόρυ or λόγχη:\r\nand Krüger refers to Philostratus, Icon. ii. 82, ἐπὶ τῆς πέλτης ἀετός.\r\nIn Cyrop. vii. 1, 4, the insigne of Cyrus the elder is said to have been\r\na golden eagle, ἐπὶ δόρατος μακροῦ ἀνατεταμένος. Πέλτη accordingly being\r\ntaken in this sense, all is clear, and ἐπὶ ξύλου is superfluous. Kühner\r\ngives great praise to the conjecture of Hutchinson, ἐπὶ πέλτης ἐπὶ\r\nξυστοῦ, who, taking πέλτη in the sense of _a shield_, supposed that the\r\neagle was mounted on a shield, and the shield on a spear. But the shield\r\nwould surely have been a mere encumbrance, and we had better be rid of\r\nit. Yet to take πέλτη in the sense of _a spear_, unusual in Xenophon, is\r\nnot altogether satisfactory; and it would be well if we could fairly\r\nadmit into the text Leunclavius's conjecture, ἐπὶ παλτοῦ.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Ἀνατεταμένον.] This word is generally understood to\r\nsignify that the eagle's wings were expanded.

Ant. sub _Signa\r\nMilitaria_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n     The Greeks are surprised to hear of the death of Cyrus. Ariæus\r\n     resolves to return to Ionia, contrary to the advice of Clearchus,\r\n     who incites him to make an attempt on the throne of Persia.\r\n     Artaxerxes sends a message to the Greeks; their reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. How the Grecian force was collected for Cyrus, when he undertook his\r\nexpedition against his brother Artaxerxes, what occurred in his march up\r\nthe country, how the battle took place, how Cyrus was killed, and how\r\nthe Greeks returned to their camp and went to rest, in the belief that\r\nthey were completely victorious, and that Cyrus was still alive, has\r\nbeen related in the preceding book.\r\n\r\n2. When it was day, the generals met together, and expressed their\r\nsurprise that Cyrus had neither sent any person to give directions how\r\nthey should act, nor had made his appearance himself. It seemed best to\r\nthem, therefore, to pack up what baggage they had, and, arming\r\nthemselves, to march forward till they could effect a junction with\r\nCyrus. 3. But when they were on the point of starting, just as the sun\r\nwas rising, there came to them Procles, the governor of Teuthrania, (who\r\nwas descended from Damaratus, the Lacedæmonian,) and with him Glus, the\r\nson of Tamos, who told them that Cyrus was dead, and that Ariæus, having\r\nfled, was, with the rest of the Barbarians, at the station whence they\r\nstarted the day before; and that he said he would wait for the Greeks\r\nthat day, if they would come to him; but on the morrow, he said, he\r\nshould set off for Ionia, from whence he had come.\r\n\r\n4. The generals, on hearing this intelligence, and the other Greeks, on\r\nlearning it from them,[80] were grievously afflicted; and Clearchus\r\nspoke thus: \"Would that Cyrus were still alive; but since he is no more,\r\ncarry back word to Ariæus, that we at least are victorious over the\r\nking, and that, as you see, no enemy any longer offers us battle; and if\r\nyou had not come, we should have marched against the king; and we\r\npromise Ariæus that, if he will come hither, we will seat him on the\r\nroyal throne: for to those who conquer, it belongs also to rule.\" 5.\r\nSaying this, he dismissed the messengers, and sent with them\r\nCheirisophus the Lacedæmonian, and Menon the Thessalian; for Menon\r\nhimself desired to go, as he was connected with Ariæus by ties of\r\nfriendship and hospitality.\r\n\r\n6. While they departed on their mission Clearchus waited where he was;\r\nand the troops supplied themselves with food, as well as they could,\r\nfrom the carcases of their baggage-cattle, slaughtering their oxen and\r\nasses; and, going a little way in front of the line, to the place where\r\nthe battle was fought, they collected and used as fuel, not only the\r\narrows, which lay in great quantities, and which the Greeks had\r\ncompelled the deserters from the king to throw down, but also the wicker\r\nshields of the Persians, and the wooden ones of the Egyptians; and there\r\nwere also many other light shields, and waggons emptied of their\r\ncontents[81] to be taken away; using all which materials to cook the\r\nmeat, they appeased their hunger for that day.\r\n\r\n7. It was now about the middle of the forenoon,[82] when some heralds\r\narrived from the king and Tissaphernes, all of them Barbarians, except\r\none, a Greek named Phalinus, who chanced to be with Tissaphernes, and\r\nwas highly esteemed by him, for he had pretensions to skill in the\r\narrangement of troops, and in the exercise of heavy arms. 8. These\r\npersons having approached, and asked to speak with the commanders of the\r\nGreeks, told them, \"that the king, since he had gained the victory and\r\nslain Cyrus, required the Greeks to deliver up their arms, and go to the\r\ngates of the king,[83] and try to obtain, if they could, some favour\r\nfrom him.\" 9. Thus spoke the king's heralds; and the Greeks heard them\r\nwith no small concern: but Clearchus only said, \"that it was not the\r\npart of conquerors to deliver up their arms; but,\" he continued, \"do\r\nyou, fellow-captains, give these men such an answer as you think most\r\nhonourable and proper; and I will return immediately;\" for one of the\r\nattendants just then called him away to inspect the entrails which had\r\nbeen taken out of the victim, as he happened to be engaged in sacrifice.\r\n10. Cleanor the Arcadian, the oldest of them, then answered, that \"they\r\nwould die before they would deliver up their arms.\" \"For my part,\" said\r\nProxenus the Theban, \"I wonder, Phalinus, whether it is as conqueror\r\nthat the king asks for our arms, or as gifts in friendship; for if as\r\nconqueror, why should he ask for them at all, and not rather come and\r\ntake them? But if he wishes to get them from us by means of persuasion,\r\nlet him say what will be left to the soldiers, if they gratify him in\r\nthis particular.\" 11. To this Phalinus replied, \"The king considers\r\nhimself the conqueror, since he has slain Cyrus. For who is there now\r\nthat disputes the sovereignty with him? And he also looks upon\r\nyourselves as his captives, having you here in the middle of his\r\ndominions, and enclosed within impassable rivers; and being able to lead\r\nsuch multitudes against you, as, though he gave them into your power, it\r\nwould be impossible for you to destroy.\"\r\n\r\n12. After him, Theopompus,[84] an Athenian, spoke thus: \"O Phalinus, we\r\nhave now, as you see, nothing to avail us, except our arms and our\r\nvalour. While we retain our arms, we may hope to profit by our valour;\r\nbut if we were to give them up, we should expect to be deprived also of\r\nour lives. Do not suppose, therefore, that we shall give up to you the\r\nonly things of value that we possess; but, with these in our hands, we\r\nwill even fight for whatever of value you possess.\" 13. On hearing him\r\nspeak thus, Phalinus smiled, and said, \"You seem like a philosopher,\r\nyoung man, and express yourself not without grace; but be assured that\r\nyou are out of your senses if you imagine that your valour will prove\r\nvictorious over the might of the king.\" 14. But it was reported that\r\ncertain others of the generals, giving way to their fears, said that\r\nthey had been faithful to Cyrus, and might likewise prove of great\r\nservice to the king, if he were willing to become their friend; and that\r\nwhether he might wish to employ them in any other service, or in an\r\nexpedition against Egypt, they would assist him in reducing it.\r\n\r\n15. In the mean time Clearchus returned, and asked whether they had yet\r\ngiven their answer. Phalinus, in reply, said, \"Your companions, O\r\nClearchus, give each a different answer; and now tell us what you have\r\nto say.\" 16. Clearchus then said, \"I was glad to see you, O Phalinus,\r\nand so, I dare say, were all the rest of us; for you are a Greek, as we\r\nalso are; and, being so many in number as you see, and placed in such\r\ncircumstances, we would advise with you how we should act with regard to\r\nthe message that you bring. 17. Give us then, I entreat you by the gods,\r\nsuch advice as seems to you most honourable and advantageous, and such\r\nas will bring you honour in time to come, when it is related, that\r\nPhalinus, being once sent from the king to require the Greeks to deliver\r\nup their arms, gave them, when they consulted him, such and such\r\ncounsel; for you know that whatever counsel you do give, will\r\nnecessarily be reported in Greece.\"\r\n\r\n18. Clearchus craftily threw out this suggestion, with the desire that\r\nthe very person who came as an envoy from the king, should advise them\r\nnot to deliver up their arms, in order that the Greeks might be led to\r\nconceive better hopes. But Phalinus, adroitly evading the appeal, spoke,\r\ncontrary to his expectation, as follows: 19. \"If, out of ten thousand\r\nhopeful chances, you have any single one, of saving yourselves by\r\ncontinuing in arms against the king, I advise you not to deliver up\r\nyour arms; but if you have not a single hope of safety in opposing the\r\nking's pleasure, I advise you to save yourselves in the only way in\r\nwhich it is possible.\" 20. Clearchus rejoined, \"Such, then, is your\r\nadvice; but on our part return this answer, that we are of opinion,\r\nthat, if we are to be friends with the king, we shall be more valuable\r\nfriends if we retain our arms, than if we surrender them to another; but\r\nthat if we must make war against him, we should make war better if we\r\nretain our arms, than if we give them up to another.\" 21. Phalinus said,\r\n\"This answer, then, we will report: but the king desired us also to\r\ninform you, that while you remain in this place, a truce is to be\r\nconsidered as existing between him and you; but, if you advance or\r\nretreat, there is to be war. Give us, therefore, your answer on this\r\npoint also; whether you will remain here, and a truce is to exist, or\r\nwhether I shall announce from you, that there is war.\" 22. Clearchus\r\nreplied, \"Report, therefore, on this point also, that our resolution is\r\nthe same as that of the king.\" \"And what is that?\" said Phalinus.\r\nClearchus replied, \"If we stay here, a truce; but if we retreat or\r\nadvance, war.\" 23. Phalinus again asked him, \"Is it a truce or war that\r\nI shall report?\" Clearchus again made the same answer: \"A truce, if we\r\nstay; and if we retreat or advance, war.\" But of what he intended to do,\r\nhe gave no intimation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Πυνθανόμενοι.] Schneider and others would omit this word,\r\nas an apparent interpolation. I have followed Kühner's interpretation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Φέρεσθαι ἔρημοι.] Before Φέρεσθαι is to be understood\r\nὥστε, as Zeune and Weiske observe. Kühner remarks that ἔρημοι should\r\nproperly be referred to both πέλται and ἅμαξαι: the shields were without\r\nowners, and the waggons without their contents, as having been plundered\r\nby the enemy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Περὶ πλήθουσαν ἀγοράν.] See i. 8. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: See i. 9. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Θεόπομπος.] This is the reading of six manuscripts; others\r\nhave Ξενοφῶν. The passage has greatly exercised the ingenuity of the\r\nlearned, some endeavouring to support one reading, some the other. If we\r\nfollow manuscript authority, it cannot be doubted that Θεόπομπος is\r\ngenuine. Weiske thinks \"Xenophon\" inadmissible, because the officers\r\nonly of the Greeks were called to a conference, and Xenophon, as appears\r\nfrom iii. 1. 4, was not then in the service: as for the other arguments\r\nthat he has offered, they are of no weight. Krüger (Quæstt. de Xen. Vit.\r\np. 12) attempts to refute Weiske, and to defend the name of Xenophon,\r\nconjecturing that some scholiast may have written in the margin\r\nΘεοπόμπος δὲ Πρόξενον τοῦτο εἰπεῖν φησι, whence the name of Theopompus\r\nmay have crept into the text, as Diod. Sic., xiv. 25, attributes those\r\nwords to Proxenus. But as this notion rests on conjecture alone, I have\r\nthought it safest, with Weiske, Schneider, Poppo, and Dindorf, to adhere\r\nto the reading of the best manuscripts. * * * Who this Theopompus was,\r\nhowever, is unknown; for he is nowhere else mentioned in the Anabasis.\r\n_Kühner_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     The Greeks, joining Ariæus, form an alliance with him, and take\r\n     counsel with him in reference to their return. During the night\r\n     following the first day's march they are seized with a panic, which\r\n     Clearchus allays.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Phalinus and his companions departed; and there now returned, from\r\ntheir interview with Ariæus, Procles and Cheirisophus; Menon had\r\nremained there with Ariæus. They reported, \"that Ariæus said that there\r\nwere many Persians, of superior rank to himself, who would not endure\r\nthat he should be king; but,\" he adds, \"if you wish to return with him,\r\nhe desires you to come to him this very night; if you do not, he says\r\nthat he will set out by himself early in the morning.\" 2. Clearchus\r\nrejoined, \"And we must certainly do as you say, if we determine to go to\r\nhim; but if not, adopt for yourselves such measures as you may think\r\nmost for your advantage;\" for not even to them did he disclose what he\r\nintended to do.\r\n\r\n3. But afterwards, when the sun was setting, having assembled the\r\ngenerals and captains, he spoke as follows: \"My friends, when I offered\r\na sacrifice with reference to marching against the king, the signs of\r\nthe victims were not favourable, and indeed it was with good cause that\r\nthey were not so; for as I now learn, there is between us and the king\r\nthe river Tigris, a navigable river, which we could not cross without\r\nvessels; and vessels we have none. Yet it is not possible to remain\r\nhere; for we have no means of procuring provisions. But for going to the\r\nfriends of Cyrus, the sacrifices were extremely favourable. 4. We must\r\naccordingly proceed thus: when we separate, we must sup, each of us on\r\nwhat he has; when the signal is given with the horn as if for going to\r\nrest, proceed to pack up your baggage; when it sounds the second time,\r\nplace it on your baggage-cattle; and, at the third signal, follow him\r\nwho leads the way, keeping your baggage-cattle next the river, and the\r\nheavy-armed troops on the outside.\" 5. The generals and captains, after\r\nlistening to this address, went away, and did as he directed; and\r\nthenceforth he commanded, and the others obeyed, not indeed having\r\nelected him commander, but perceiving that he alone possessed such\r\nqualifications as a leader ought to have, and that the rest of them were\r\ncomparatively inexperienced.\r\n\r\n6. The computation of the route which they had come from Ephesus in\r\nIonia to the field of battle, was ninety-three days' march, and five\r\nhundred and thirty-five parasangs, or sixteen thousand and fifty\r\nstadia;[85] and the distance from the field of battle to Babylon was\r\nsaid to be three hundred and sixty stadia.\r\n\r\n7. Here, as soon as it was dark, Miltocythes the Thracian deserted to\r\nthe king, with about forty horse that he commanded, and nearly three\r\nhundred of the Thracian infantry. 8. Clearchus led the way for the rest,\r\nin the prescribed order; and they followed, and arrived at the first\r\nhalting-place,[86] to join Ariæus and his troops about midnight; and the\r\ngenerals and captains of the Greeks, having drawn up their men under\r\narms, went in a body to Ariæus; when the Greeks on the one hand, and\r\nAriæus and his principal officers on the other, took an oath not to\r\nbetray each other, and to be true allies; and the Barbarians took\r\nanother oath, that they would lead the way without treachery. 9. These\r\noaths they took after sacrificing a bull, a wolf,[87] a boar, and a ram,\r\nover a shield, the Greeks dipping a sword, and the Barbarians a lance,\r\ninto the blood.\r\n\r\n10. When these pledges of mutual fidelity were given, Clearchus said:\r\n\"Since then, Ariæus, our route and yours is now the same, tell us, what\r\nis your opinion with respect to our course; whether we shall return the\r\nway we came, or whether you consider that you have thought of a better\r\nway.\" 11. Ariæus replied: \"If we were to return the way we came, we\r\nshould all perish of hunger; for we have now no supply of provisions;\r\nand for the last seventeen days' march, even when we were coming hither,\r\nwe could procure nothing from the country through which we passed; or,\r\nif anything was to be found there, we consumed it ourselves in our\r\npassage. But now we propose to take a longer road, but one in which we\r\nshall not want for provisions. 12. We must make the first days' marches\r\nas long as we can, that we may remove ourselves to the greatest possible\r\ndistance from the king's army; for if we once escape two or three days'\r\njourney from him, the king will no longer be able to overtake us; since\r\nhe will not dare to pursue us with a small force; and, with a numerous\r\narmy, he will not be able to march fast enough, and will probably\r\nexperience a scarcity of provisions.\" \"Such,\" he concluded, \"is my\r\nopinion.\"\r\n\r\n13. This scheme for conducting the army was calculated for nothing else\r\nthan to effect an escape, clandestinely or openly, by flight.[88] But\r\nfortune proved a better leader; for as soon as it was day they began\r\ntheir march, with the sun on their right, expecting to arrive about\r\nsunset at some villages in the Babylonian territory; and in this\r\nexpectation they were not disappointed. 14. But, in the afternoon, they\r\nthought that they perceived some of the enemy's cavalry; and those of\r\nthe Greeks who happened not to be in their ranks, ran to their places in\r\nthe ranks; and Ariæus (for he was riding in a waggon because he had been\r\nwounded) came down and put on his armour, as did those who were with\r\nhim. 15. But while they were arming themselves, the scouts that had been\r\nsent forward returned, and reported that they were not cavalry, but\r\nbaggage-cattle grazing; and every one immediately concluded that the\r\nking was encamped somewhere near. Smoke also was seen rising from some\r\nvillages not far distant. 16. Clearchus however did not lead his troops\r\nagainst the enemy; (for he was aware that his soldiers were tired and in\r\nwant of food; and besides it was now late;) yet he did not turn out of\r\nhis way, taking care not to appear to flee, but continued his march in a\r\ndirect line, and took up his quarters with his vanguard, just at sunset,\r\nin the nearest villages, from which even the wood-work of the houses had\r\nbeen carried off by the king's troops. 17. These, therefore, who were in\r\nadvance, encamped with some degree of regularity; but those who\r\nfollowed, coming up in the dark, took up with such quarters as they\r\nchanced to find, and made so much noise in calling to each other, that\r\neven the enemy heard them; and those of the enemy who were stationed the\r\nnearest, fled from their encampments. 18. That this had been the case,\r\nbecame apparent on the following day; for there was no longer a single\r\nbeast of burden to be seen, nor any camp, nor smoke anywhere near. The\r\nking had been alarmed, as it seemed, by the sudden approach of the\r\nGrecian army; and of this he gave proof by what he did on the following\r\nday.\r\n\r\n19. However, in the course of this night, a panic fell upon the Greeks\r\nthemselves, and there arose such noise and commotion in their camp as\r\nusually ensues on the occurrence of sudden terror. 20. Upon this,\r\nClearchus ordered Tolmides, an Eleian, whom he happened to have with\r\nhim, the best[89] herald of his time, to command silence; and proclaim,\r\nthat \"the generals give notice, that whoever will give information of\r\nthe person who turned the ass among the arms,[90] shall receive a reward\r\nof a talent of silver.\" 21. On this proclamation being made, the\r\nsoldiers were convinced that their alarm was groundless, and their\r\ngenerals were safe. At break of day, Clearchus issued orders for the\r\nGreeks to form themselves under arms, in the same order in which they\r\nhad been when the battle took place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: As Xenophon, in the first book, has enumerated only 84\r\ndays' march, 517 parasangs, which make but 15,510 stadia, Zeune thinks\r\nthat the 9 days' march, and 18 parasangs, here added, are to be\r\nunderstood as forming the route from Ephesus to Sardis. Krüger is\r\ninclined to think the passage an interpolation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Εἰς τὸν πρῶτον σταθμόν.] This is the σταθμός mentioned in\r\ni. 10. 1, being that from which the army of Cyrus started on the day\r\nwhen the battle took place.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Bornemann observes that the sacrifice of the wolf seems to\r\nhave been the act of the Persians, referring to Plutarch de Is. et Os.,\r\nwhere it is said that it was a custom with them to sacrifice that\r\nanimal. \"They thought the wolf,\" he adds, \"the son and image of\r\nAhrimanes, as appears from Kleuker in Append. ad Zendavestam, T. II. P.\r\niii. pp. 78, 84; see also Brisson, p. 388.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Ἀποδρᾶναι καὶ ἀποφυγεῖν.] The first means to flee, so that\r\nit cannot be discovered whither the fugitive is gone; the second, so\r\nthat he cannot be overtaken. _Kühner_ ad i. 4. 8. \"Fugâ vel clandestinâ\r\nvel apertâ.\" _Weiske_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Ἄριοστον.] Best, apparently, on account of the loudness or\r\nclearness of his voice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: The arms, as Kühner observes, were piled in front of the\r\nmen's quarters. The affair of the ass was an invention of Clearchus to\r\ndraw off the thoughts of the soldiers from the subject of their\r\napprehension. Polyænus, iii. 9. 4, speaks of a similar stratagem having\r\nbeen adopted by Iphicrates.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     The king proposes a truce, and supplies the Greeks with provisions\r\n     during the negotiation. Three days after he sends Tissaphernes to\r\n     them, to ask why they had engaged in hostilities against him; he is\r\n     answered by Clearchus. A treaty is then concluded, the king\r\n     engaging to send home the Greeks under the conduct of Tissaphernes,\r\n     and the Greeks promising to do no injury to the countries through\r\n     which they should pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. What I just now stated, that the king was alarmed at the approach of\r\nthe Greeks, became evident by what followed; for though, when he sent to\r\nthem on the preceding day, he desired them to deliver up their arms, he\r\nnow, at sunrise, sent heralds to negotiate a truce. 2. These heralds,\r\nupon arriving at the outposts, requested to speak with the commanders.\r\nTheir request being reported by the guards, Clearchus, who happened then\r\nto be inspecting the several divisions, told the guards to desire the\r\nheralds to wait till he should be at leisure. 3. When he had arranged\r\nthe army in such a manner as to present on every side the fair\r\nappearance of a compact phalanx, and so that none of the unarmed were to\r\nbe seen, he called for the heralds, and came forward himself, having\r\nabout him the best-armed and best-looking of his soldiers, and told the\r\nother leaders to do the same. 4. When he drew near the messengers, he\r\nasked them what they wanted. They replied, \"that they came to negotiate\r\na truce, with full powers to communicate with the Greeks on behalf of\r\nthe king, and with the king on behalf of the Greeks.\" 5. Clearchus\r\nanswered, \"Tell the king, then, that we must come to battle first; for\r\nwe have no breakfast;[91] and there is no one who will dare to talk to\r\nthe Greeks of a truce, without first supplying them with breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n6. On hearing this answer, the messengers departed, but soon returned;\r\nfrom whence it was apparent that the king, or some other person to whom\r\na commission had been given to conduct the negotiation, was somewhere\r\nnear. They brought word, \"that the king thought what they said was\r\nreasonable, and that they now came with guides, who, in case the truce\r\nshould be settled, would conduct the Greeks to a place where they might\r\nprocure provisions.\" 7. Clearchus then inquired, whether the king would\r\ngrant the benefit of the truce to those only who went to him, on their\r\nway thither and back, or whether the truce would be with the rest as\r\nwell.[92] The messengers replied, \"With all; until what you have to say\r\nis communicated to the king.\" 8. When they had said this, Clearchus,\r\ndirecting them to withdraw, deliberated with the other officers; and\r\nthey proposed to conclude the truce at once, and to go after the\r\nprovisions at their ease, and supply themselves. 9. And Clearchus said,\r\n\"I too am of that opinion. I will not, however, announce our\r\ndetermination immediately, but will wait till the messengers begin to be\r\nuneasy lest we should determine not to conclude the truce. And yet,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I suspect that a similar apprehension will arise among our own\r\nsoldiers.\" When he thought therefore that the proper time had arrived,\r\nhe announced to the messengers that he agreed to the truce, and desired\r\nthem to conduct him forthwith to the place where the provisions were.\r\n\r\n10. They accordingly led the way; and Clearchus proceeded to conclude\r\nthe truce, keeping his army however in battle-array; the rear he brought\r\nup himself. They met with ditches and canals so full of water that they\r\ncould not cross without bridges; but they made crossings of the\r\npalm-trees which had fallen, and others which they cut down. 11. Here it\r\nmight be seen how Clearchus performed the duties of a commander, holding\r\nhis spear in his left hand, and a staff in his right; and if any of\r\nthose ordered to the work seemed to him to loiter at it, he would select\r\na fit object for punishment,[93] and give him a beating, and would lend\r\nhis assistance himself,[94] leaping into the midst, so that all were\r\nashamed not to share his industry. 12. The men of thirty and under only\r\nhad been appointed by him to the work; but the older men, when they saw\r\nClearchus thus busily employed, gave their assistance likewise. 13.\r\nClearchus made so much the more haste, as he suspected that the ditches\r\nwere not always so full of water; (for it was not the season for\r\nirrigating the ground;) but thought that the king had let out the water\r\nupon the plain, in order that even now there might appear to the Greeks\r\nto be many difficulties in the march.\r\n\r\n14. Proceeding on their way, they arrived at some villages, from which\r\nthe guides signified that they might procure provisions. In these\r\nvillages there was great plenty of corn, and wine made from dates, and\r\nan acidulous drink obtained from them by boiling. 15. As to the dates\r\nthemselves, such as those we see in Greece were here put aside for the\r\nuse of the servants; but those which were laid by for their masters,\r\nwere choice fruit, remarkable for beauty and size; their colour was not\r\nunlike that of amber; and some of these they dried and preserved as\r\nsweetmeats. These were a pleasant accompaniment to drink, but apt to\r\ncause headache. 16. Here too the soldiers for the first time tasted the\r\ncabbage[95] from the top of the palm-tree, and most of them were\r\nagreeably struck both with its external appearance and the peculiarity\r\nof its sweetness. But this also was exceedingly apt to give headache.\r\nThe palm-tree, out of which the cabbage had been taken, soon withered\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\n17. In this place they remained three days, when Tissaphernes arrived\r\nfrom the Great King, and with him the brother of the king's wife, and\r\nthree other Persians; and a numerous retinue attended them. The generals\r\nof the Greeks having met them on their arrival, Tissaphernes first spoke\r\nby an interpreter, to the following effect: 18. \"I myself dwell, O\r\nGreeks, in the neighbourhood of your country; and when I perceived you\r\nfallen into many troubles and difficulties, I thought it a piece of good\r\nfortune if I could in any way press a request upon the king to allow me\r\nto conduct you in safety back to Greece. For I think that such a service\r\nwould be attended with no want of gratitude either from yourselves or\r\nfrom Greece in general. 19. With these considerations, I made my request\r\nto the king, representing to him that he might reasonably grant me this\r\nfavour, because I had been the first to give him intelligence that Cyrus\r\nwas marching against him, and at the same time that I brought him the\r\nintelligence, had come to him with an auxiliary force; because I alone,\r\nof all those opposed to the Greeks, did not flee, but, on the contrary,\r\ncharged through the midst of them, and joined the king in your camp,\r\nwhither he came after he had slain Cyrus; and because, together with\r\nthese who are now present with me, and who are his most faithful\r\nservants, I engaged in pursuit of the Barbarian part of Cyrus's army.\r\n20. The king promised to consider of my request; and in the mean time\r\ndesired me to come and ask you, on what account it was that you took the\r\nfield against him; and I advise you to answer with moderation, in order\r\nthat it may be easier for me to secure you whatever advantage I can from\r\nthe king.\"\r\n\r\n21. The Greeks then withdrew, and, after some deliberation, gave their\r\nanswer, Clearchus speaking for them: \"We neither formed ourselves into a\r\nbody, with the view of making war upon the king, nor, when we set out,\r\nwas our march directed against him; but Cyrus, as you yourself are well\r\naware, devised many pretences for his proceedings, that he might both\r\ntake you by surprise, and lead us up hither. 22. But when we afterwards\r\nsaw him in danger, we were ashamed, in the face of gods and men, to\r\ndesert him, as we had before allowed him to bestow favours upon us. 23.\r\nAs Cyrus, however, is now dead, we neither dispute the sovereignty with\r\nthe king, nor is there any reason why we should desire to do harm to the\r\nking's territory; nor would we wish to kill him, but would proceed\r\nhomeward, if no one molest us; but we will endeavour, with the aid of\r\nthe gods, to avenge ourselves on any one that may do us an injury;\r\nwhile, if any one does us good, we shall not be behind-hand in requiting\r\nhim to the utmost of our power.\" Thus spoke Clearchus. 24. Tissaphernes,\r\nhaving heard him, said, \"I will report your answer to the king, and\r\nbring back to you his reply; and till I return, let the truce remain in\r\nforce; and we will provide a market for you.\"\r\n\r\n25. On the following day he did not return; so that the Greeks began to\r\nbe anxious; but on the third day he came, and said, that he returned\r\nafter having obtained the king's permission to be allowed to save the\r\nGreeks; although many spoke against it, saying that it did not become\r\nthe king to suffer men to escape who had engaged in war against him. 26.\r\nIn conclusion he said, \"You may now receive from us solemn promises\r\nthat we will render the country, through which you will pass, friendly\r\nto you; and will, without treachery, conduct you back to Greece,\r\naffording you opportunities of purchasing provisions; and wheresoever we\r\ndo not afford you an opportunity of purchasing, we will allow you to\r\ntake for yourselves necessaries from the adjacent country. 27. On the\r\nother hand, it will be incumbent upon you to swear to us, that you will\r\nmarch, as through a friendly territory, without doing harm, only taking\r\na supply of meat and drink, whenever we do not give you an opportunity\r\nof purchasing, but that if we give you such opportunity, you will\r\nprocure your supplies by purchase.\" 28. These conditions were assented\r\nto; and they took the oaths, and Tissaphernes and the brother of the\r\nking's wife gave their right-hands to the generals and captains of the\r\nGreeks, and received from the Greeks theirs in return. 29. After this,\r\nTissaphernes said, \"And now I shall go back to the king; and as soon as\r\nI have accomplished what I wish, I will come again, after making the\r\nnecessary preparations, for the purpose of conducting you back to\r\nGreece, and returning myself to my province.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Ἄριοστον.] This word answers to the Latin _prandium_, a\r\nmeal taken in the early part of the day. We cannot here render it\r\n\"dinner.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: I have translated this passage as I think that the drift\r\nof the narrative requires. Krüger refers σπένδοιτο to Clearchus, and\r\nthinks that by ἀυτοῖς τοῖς ἀνδράσι are meant the Persian deputies. Some\r\ncritics suppose that by those words the men who were to get provisions\r\nare intended. To me nothing seems consistent with the context but to\r\nrefer σπένδοιτο to the king, and to understand by ἀυτοῖς τοῖς ἀνδράσι\r\nthe messengers from the Greeks.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Τον ἐπιτήδειον.] Scil. παίεσθαι, _pœnæ idoneum, pœnû\r\ndignum_. Kühner.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: Προσελάμβανε.] _Manum operi admovebat._ Kühner.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Τὸν ἐγκέφαλον.] Literally \"the brain.\" Dulcis medulla\r\nearum [palmarum] in cacumine, quod cerebrum appellant. Plin. H. N. xiii.\r\n4. See also Theophr. ii. 8; Galen. de Fac. simpl. Medic. iv. 15. It is\r\ngenerally interpreted _medulla_, \"marrow\" or \"pith,\" but it is in\r\nreality a sort of bud at the top of the palm-tree, containing the last\r\ntender leaves, with flowers, and continuing in that state two years\r\nbefore it unfolds the flower; as appears from Boryd. St. Vincent Itiner.\r\nt. i. p. 223, vers. Germ., who gives his information on the authority of\r\nDu Petit Thouars. The French call it _choux_; the Germans, _Kohl_,\r\nSchneider. \"By modern travellers it is called the _cabbage_ of the palm;\r\nit 'is composed' (says Sir Joseph Banks) 'of the rudiments of the future\r\nleaves of the palm-tree, enveloped in the bases or footstalks of the\r\nactual leaves; which enclose them as a tight box or trunk would do.' It\r\nforms a mass of convolutions, exquisitely beautiful and delicate; and\r\nwonderful to appearance, when unfolded. It is also exceedingly delicate\r\nto the taste. Xenophon has justly remarked that the trees from whence it\r\nwas taken withered.\" _Rennell's Illustrations of the Exp. of Cyrus_, p.\r\n118.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     The Greeks conceive distrust both of Tissaphernes and Ariæus, and\r\n     resolve to march apart from the Persians. They commence their march\r\n     under the guidance of Tissaphernes, pass the wall of Media, and\r\n     cross the Tigris.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. After these occurrences, the Greeks and Ariæus, encamping near each\r\nother, waited for Tissaphernes more than twenty days;[96] in the course\r\nof which there came to visit Ariæus both his brothers and other\r\nrelations, and certain other Persians, to see his companions, and gave\r\nthem encouraging hopes; some too were the bearers of assurances[97] from\r\nthe king, that he would not remember to their disadvantage their\r\nexpedition against him under Cyrus, or anything else that was past. 2.\r\nOn these things taking place, the followers of Ariæus evidently began to\r\npay the Greeks less attention; so that, on this account, they rendered\r\nmost of the Greeks dissatisfied with them; and many of them, going to\r\nClearchus and the other generals, said, 3. \"Why do we remain here? are\r\nwe not aware that the king would wish above all things to destroy us, in\r\norder that a dread of going to war with the Great Monarch may fall upon\r\nthe rest of the Greeks? For the present, he craftily protracts our stay,\r\nbecause his forces are dispersed; but, when his army is re-assembled, it\r\nis not possible but that he will attack us. 4. Perhaps, too, he is\r\ndigging some trench, or building some wall, that the way may be rendered\r\nimpassable; for he will never consent, at least willingly, that we\r\nshould go back to Greece, and relate how so small a number as we are\r\nhave defeated the king at his own gates, and returned after setting him\r\nat nought.\"\r\n\r\n5. To those who thus addressed him, Clearchus answered, \"I have been\r\nconsidering all these things as well; but I think that, if we now go\r\naway, we shall be thought to go with a view to war, and to act contrary\r\nto the terms of the truce. Moreover, in the first place, there will be\r\nno one to provide us a market, or any means of procuring provisions;\r\nand, in the next place, there will be no one to guide us; besides, the\r\nmoment that we do this, Ariæus will separate himself from us so that not\r\na friend will be left us; and, what is more, our former friends will\r\nthen become our enemies. 6. Whether there is any other river for us to\r\ncross, I do not know; but as for the Euphrates, we know that it is\r\nimpossible to cross that, if the enemy try to prevent us. Nor yet, if it\r\nshould be necessary to fight, have we any horse to support us; while the\r\nenemy's cavalry is most numerous and efficient; so that, though we were\r\nvictorious, how many of our enemies should we be able to kill? And, if\r\nwe were defeated, it would not be possible for a man of us to escape. 7.\r\nWith regard to the king, therefore, who is aided by so many advantages,\r\nI know not, if he wishes to effect our destruction, why he should swear,\r\nand give his right-hand, and perjure himself before the gods, and\r\nrender his pledges faithless both to Greeks and Barbarians.\" He said\r\nmuch besides to the same effect.\r\n\r\n8. In the mean time Tissaphernes arrived, with his army, as if with the\r\nview of returning home; and Orontes came with his army. Orontes also\r\nbrought[98] with him the king's daughter, whom he had received in\r\nmarriage.[99] 9. From hence they now proceeded on their march,\r\nTissaphernes being their guide, and securing them opportunities of\r\nbuying provisions; Ariæus also, with the Barbarian troops of Cyrus,\r\nmarched in company with Tissaphernes and Orontes, and encamped in common\r\nwith them. 10. But the Greeks, conceiving a suspicion of these men,\r\nbegan to march by themselves, taking guides of their own; and they\r\nalways encamped at the distance of a parasang, or little less, from each\r\nother; and both parties kept on their guard against one another, as if\r\nthey had been enemies, and this consequently increased their mistrustful\r\nfeelings. 11. More than once, too, as they were gathering fuel, or\r\ncollecting grass and other such things, in the same quarter, they came\r\nto blows with each other;[100] and this was an additional source of\r\nanimosity between them.\r\n\r\n12. After marching three days, they arrived at the wall of Media,[101]\r\nas it is called, and passed to the other side of it. This wall was built\r\nof burnt bricks, laid in bitumen; it was twenty feet in thickness, and a\r\nhundred in height, and the length of it was said to be twenty parasangs;\r\nand it was not far distant from Babylon. 13. Hence they proceeded, in\r\ntwo days' march, the distance of eight parasangs; crossing two canals,\r\nthe one by a permanent bridge, the other by a temporary one formed of\r\nseven boats. These canals were supplied from the river Tigris; and from\r\none to the other of them were cut ditches across the country, the first\r\nof considerable size, and the next smaller; and at last diminutive\r\ndrains, such as are cut in Greece through the panic[102] fields. They\r\nthen arrived at the Tigris; near which there was a large and populous\r\ncity, called Sitace, distant from the banks of the river only fifteen\r\nstadia. 14. In the neighbourhood of this city the Greeks encamped, close\r\nto an extensive and beautiful park, thickly planted with all kinds of\r\ntrees. The Barbarians, though they had but just crossed the Tigris, were\r\nno longer in sight.\r\n\r\n15. After supper Proxenus and Xenophon happened to be walking in front\r\nof the place where the arms were piled, when a man approached, and\r\ninquired of the sentinels where he could see Proxenus or Clearchus. But\r\nhe did not ask for Menon, though he came from Ariæus, Menon's intimate\r\nfriend. 16. Proxenus replying, \"I am the person whom you seek,\" the man\r\nsaid, \"Ariæus and Artaozus, the faithful friends of Cyrus, who are\r\ninterested for your welfare, have sent me to you, and exhort you to\r\nbeware lest the Barbarians should fall upon you in the night; for there\r\nis a considerable body of troops in the adjoining park. 17. They also\r\nadvise you to send a guard to the bridge over the Tigris, as\r\nTissaphernes designs to break it down in the night, if he can, in order\r\nthat you may not be able to cross the river, but may be hemmed in\r\nbetween the river and the canal.\" 18. On hearing the man's message, they\r\nconducted him to Clearchus, and told him what he had said. When\r\nClearchus heard it he was greatly agitated and alarmed.\r\n\r\n19. But a young man,[103] one of those who were present, after\r\nreflecting a little on the matter, observed, \"that the imputed designs\r\nof making an attack, and of breaking down the bridge, were not\r\nconsistent; for,\" said he, \"if they attack us, they must certainly\r\neither conquer or be conquered; if then they are to conquer us, why\r\nshould they break down the bridge? for even though there were many\r\nbridges, we have no place where we could save ourselves by flight; 20.\r\nbut if, on the other hand, we should conquer them, then, if the bridge\r\nis broken down, they will have no place of retreat; nor will any of\r\ntheir friends on the other side of the river, however numerous, be able\r\nto come to their assistance when the bridge is destroyed.\" 21. After\r\nlistening to these observations, Clearchus asked the messenger what was\r\nthe extent of the country that lay between the Tigris and the canal. He\r\nreplied, \"that it was of considerable extent, and that there were\r\nseveral villages and large towns in it.\" 22. It was then immediately\r\nconcluded, that the Barbarians had sent this man with an underhand\r\nobject, \"being afraid lest the Greeks, having taken to pieces[104] the\r\nbridge, should remain in the island, where they would have, as defences,\r\nthe river Tigris on the one side, and the canal on the other; and might\r\nprocure a sufficient supply of provisions from the country which lay\r\nbetween, and which was extensive and fertile, with people in it to\r\ncultivate it; and which would also serve as a place of refuge to any\r\nthat might be inclined to annoy the king.\r\n\r\n23. They then prepared for rest, but did not neglect, however, to send a\r\nguard to the bridge; but neither did any one attempt to attack them on\r\nany quarter, nor did any of the enemies come near the bridge, as those\r\nwho were stationed on guard there reported.\r\n\r\n24. As soon as it was day they crossed the bridge, which was constructed\r\nof thirty-seven boats, with every precaution in their power; for some of\r\nthe Greeks, who came from Tissaphernes, stated that the enemy meant to\r\nattack them as they were crossing; but this report was also false.\r\nHowever, as they were going over, Glus made his appearance, with some\r\nothers, watching to see if they were crossing the river; and when they\r\nsaw they were, he immediately rode away.\r\n\r\n25. From the Tigris they proceeded, in four days' march, a distance of\r\ntwenty parasangs, to the river Physcus, which was a plethrum in breadth,\r\nand over which was a bridge. Here was situate a large town, called Opis;\r\nnear which an illegitimate brother of Cyrus and Artaxerxes, who was\r\nleading a numerous army from Susa and Ecbatana, with the intention of\r\nassisting the king, met the Greeks, and, ordering his troops to halt,\r\ntook a view of the Greeks as they passed by. 16. Clearchus marched his\r\nmen two abreast, and halted occasionally on the way; and as long as the\r\nvan of the army halted, so long there was necessarily a halt throughout\r\nthe whole of the line; so that even to the Greeks themselves their army\r\nseemed very large, and the Persian was amazed at the sight of it.\r\n\r\n27. Hence they proceeded through Media,[105] six days' march through a\r\ndesert country, a distance of thirty parasangs, when they arrived at the\r\nvillages of Parysatis, the mother of Cyrus and the king; which\r\nTissaphernes, in mockery of Cyrus, gave permission to the Greeks to\r\nplunder of everything except the slaves. There was found in them a great\r\nquantity of corn, and sheep, and other property. 18. Hence they advanced\r\nin a march of five days more through the desert, a distance of twenty\r\nparasangs, having the Tigris on their left. At the end of the first\r\nday's march there was situate on the opposite bank of the river a large\r\nand opulent city, called Cænæ, whence the Barbarians brought over, on\r\nrafts made of hide a supply of bread, cheese, and wine.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: During this time Tissaphernes went to Babylon to the king,\r\nand was rewarded with the hand of his daughter, and the province of\r\nwhich Cyrus had been Satrap. _Diod.

The true interpretation, says Krüger, is, doubtless, \"in\r\norder that he might have her, or live with her, in wedlock,\" the\r\nmarriage ceremony having been, it would seem, previously performed at\r\nBabylon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: Πληγὰς ἐνέτεινον ἀλλήλοις.] Whether this signifies that\r\nthey actually inflicted blows on one another, or only threatened them,\r\nmay admit of some doubt. The former notion is adopted by the Latin\r\ntranslators, by Sturz in his Lexicon, and by the commentators\r\ngenerally.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: See i. 7. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: i. 2. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: Zeune thinks that Xenophon may possibly mean himself; but\r\nthis is mere conjecture.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Διελόντες.] An excellent conjectural emendation of\r\nHoltzmann for the old reading διελθόντες. _Kühner_.--The stratagem of\r\nTissaphernes was similar to that by which Themistocles expedited the\r\ndeparture of Xerxes from Greece.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: i. 7. 15.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n     After a three days' halt on the river Zabatus, Clearchus endeavours\r\n     to put an end to the distrust between the Persians and the Greeks\r\n     by an interview with Tissaphernes. He is received so plausibly that\r\n     he is induced to return on the following day, accompanied by five\r\n     other generals and twenty captains, in expectation of being\r\n     informed of the persons who had excited, by false reports, ill\r\n     feelings between the two armies. The generals are conducted into\r\n     the tent and put to death; the captains and those with them are\r\n     massacred on the outside, one only escaping to tell the tale.\r\n     Ariæus calls on the rest of the Greeks to surrender their arms, but\r\n     is answered with defiance.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Soon after, they arrived at the river Zabatus, the breadth of which\r\nwas four plethra. Here they remained three days; during which the same\r\nsuspicions continued, but no open indication of treachery appeared. 2.\r\nClearchus therefore resolved to have a meeting with Tissaphernes, and,\r\nif it was at all possible, to put a stop to these suspicions, before\r\nopen hostilities should arise from them. He accordingly sent a person to\r\nsay, that he wished to have a meeting with Tissaphernes; who at once\r\nrequested him to come. 3. When they met, Clearchus spoke as follows: \"I\r\nam aware, O Tissaphernes, that oaths have been taken, and right-hands\r\npledged between us, that we will do no injury to each other:\r\nnevertheless, I observe you on your guard against us, as though we were\r\nenemies; and we, perceiving this, stand on our guard against you. 4. But\r\nsince, upon attentive observation, I can neither detect you in any\r\nattempt to injure us, and since, as I am certain, we have no such\r\nintentions towards you, it seemed proper for me to come to a conference\r\nwith you, that we may put an end, if we can, to our distrust of one\r\nanother. 5. For I have, before now, known instances of men, who, being\r\nin fear of another, some through direct accusations, and others through\r\nmere suspicion, have, in their eagerness to act before they suffered,\r\ninflicted irremediable evils upon those who neither intended nor wished\r\nanything of the kind. 6. Thinking, therefore, that such\r\nmisunderstandings may be best cleared up by personal communications, I\r\nhave come here, and am desirous to convince you that you have no just\r\nground for mistrusting us. 7. In the first and principal place, the\r\noaths, which we have sworn by the gods, forbid us to be enemies to each\r\nother; and I should never consider him to be envied who is conscious of\r\nhaving disregarded such obligations; for from the vengeance of the gods\r\nI know not with what speed any one could flee so as to escape,[106] or\r\ninto what darkness he could steal away, or how he could retreat into any\r\nstronghold, since all things, in all places, are subject to the gods;\r\nand they have power over all everywhere alike. 8. Such are my sentiments\r\nrespecting the gods, and the oaths which we swore by them, in whose\r\nkeeping we deposited the friendship that we cemented; but among human\r\nadvantages, I, for my own part, consider you to be the greatest that we\r\nat present possess; 9. for with your assistance, every road is easy,\r\nevery river is passable, and there will be no want of provisions; but\r\nwithout you all our way would lie through darkness, (for we know nothing\r\nof it,) every river would be difficult to pass, and every multitude of\r\nmen would be terrible, but solitude most terrible of all, as it is full\r\nof extreme perplexity. 10. And even if we should be so mad as to kill\r\nyou, what else would be the consequence, than that, having slain our\r\nbenefactor, we should have to contend with the king as your most\r\npowerful avenger?[107] For my own part, of how many and how great\r\nexpectations I should deprive myself, if I attempted to do you any\r\ninjury, I will make you acquainted. 11. I was desirous that Cyrus should\r\nbe my friend, as I thought him, of all the men of his time, the most\r\nable to benefit those whom he wished to favour. But I now see that you\r\nare in the possession both of the power and the territory of Cyrus,\r\nwhile you still retain your own province, and that the power of the\r\nking, which was opposed to Cyrus, is ready to support you, 12. Such\r\nbeing the case, who is so mad as not to wish to be your friend?\r\n\r\n\"But I will mention also the circumstances from which I derive hopes\r\nthat you will yourself desire to be our friend. 13. I am aware that the\r\nMysians give you much annoyance, and these, I have no doubt, I should be\r\nable, with my present force, to render subservient to you; I am aware\r\nalso that the Pisidians molest you; and I hear that there are many such\r\nnations besides, which I think I could prevent from ever disturbing your\r\ntranquillity. As for the Egyptians, against whom I perceive you are most\r\nof all incensed. I do not see what auxiliary force you could use to\r\nchastise them better than that which I now have with me. 14. If, again,\r\namong the states that lie around you, you were desirous to become a\r\nfriend to any one, you might prove the most powerful of friends; and if\r\nany of them gave you any annoyance, you might, by our instrumentality,\r\ndeal with them[108] as a master, as we should serve you not for the\r\nsake of pay merely, but from gratitude, which we should justly feel\r\ntowards you if we are saved by your means. 15. When I consider all these\r\nthings, it appears to me so surprising that you should distrust us, that\r\nI would most gladly hear the name[109] of him who is so persuasive a\r\nspeaker as to make you believe that we are forming designs against you.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke Clearchus. Tissaphernes replied as follows: 16. \"I am\r\ndelighted, O Clearchus, to hear your judicious observations; for, with\r\nthese sentiments, if you were to meditate anything to my injury, you\r\nwould appear to be at the same time your own enemy. But that you may be\r\nconvinced that you have no just cause for distrusting either the king or\r\nme, listen to me in your turn. 17. If we wished to destroy you, do we\r\nappear to you to be deficient in numbers either of cavalry or infantry,\r\nor in warlike equipments, with the aid of which we might be able to do\r\nyou injury, without danger of suffering any in return? 18. Or do we seem\r\nto you likely to be in want of suitable places to make an attack upon\r\nyou? Are there not so many plains, which, as the inhabitants of them are\r\nfriendly to us,[110] you traverse with exceeding toil? See you not so\r\nmany mountains before you to be crossed, which we might, by\r\npre-occupying them, render impassable to you? Or are there not so many\r\nrivers, at which we might parcel you out[111] as many at a time as we\r\nmight be willing to engage? Some of these rivers, indeed, you could not\r\ncross at all, unless we secured you a passage. 19. But even supposing\r\nthat we were baffled in all these points, yet fire at least would prove\r\nits power over the produce of the soil; by burning which, we could set\r\nfamine in array against you, which, though you were the bravest of the\r\nbrave, you would find it difficult to withstand. 20. How then, having so\r\nmany means of waging war with you, and none of them attended with\r\ndanger to ourselves, should we select from amongst them all this mode,\r\nthe only one that is impious in the sight of the gods, the only one that\r\nis disgraceful in the sight of men? 21. It belongs, altogether, to men\r\nwho are destitute of means, deprived of every resource, and under the\r\ncoercion of necessity, and at the same time devoid of principle, to seek\r\nto effect their purposes by perjury towards the gods, and breach of\r\nfaith towards men. We, O Clearchus, are not so foolish or so\r\ninconsiderate; 22. or why, when we have the opportunity of effecting\r\nyour destruction, have we made no such attempt? Be well assured, that\r\nthe cause of this was my desire to prove myself faithful to the Greeks,\r\nand, in consequence of doing them service, to return supported by that\r\nvery body of foreign troops, to whom Cyrus, when he went up, trusted\r\nonly on account of the pay that he gave them. 23. As to the particulars\r\nin which you will be of service to me, some of them you have enumerated,\r\nbut of the greatest of all I am myself fully conscious; for though it is\r\npermitted to the king alone to wear the turban upright on the head, yet\r\nperhaps another than he may, with your assistance, wear that upright\r\nwhich is on the heart.\"[112]\r\n\r\n24. Tissaphernes, in speaking thus, seemed to Clearchus to speak with\r\nsincerity, and he replied, \"Do not those, then, who endeavour by calumny\r\nto make us enemies, when there are such strong inducements to friendship\r\nbetween us, deserve the severest of punishment?\" 25. \"Well, then,\" said\r\nTissaphernes, \"if you will come to me, as well generals as captains, in\r\na public manner, I will inform you who they are that tell me that you\r\nare forming plots against me and my army.\" 26. \"I will bring them all,\"\r\nsaid Clearchus, \"and, on my part, will let you know the quarter whence I\r\nhear reports respecting you.\" 27. After this conversation, Tissaphernes,\r\nbehaving to Clearchus with much courtesy, desired him to stay with him,\r\nand made him his guest at supper.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, when Clearchus returned to the camp, he plainly\r\nshowed that he considered himself to be on the most friendly footing\r\nwith Tissaphernes, and stated what he had proposed; and he said that\r\nthose must go to Tissaphernes, whose presence he required, and that\r\nwhoever of the Greeks should be proved guilty of uttering the alleged\r\ncalumnies, must be punished as traitors, and persons ill-affected to the\r\nGreeks. 28. It was Menon that he suspected of making the charges, as he\r\nknew that he had had an interview with Tissaphernes in company with\r\nAriæus, and was forming a party and intriguing against himself, in order\r\nthat, having gained the whole army over to his own interests, he might\r\nsecure the friendship of Tissaphernes. 29. Clearchus likewise wished the\r\nwhole army to have their affections fixed on himself, and troublesome\r\nrivals to be removed out of his way.\r\n\r\nSome of the soldiers urged, in opposition to his advice, that all the\r\ncaptains and generals should not go, and that they ought to place no\r\nconfidence in Tissaphernes. 30. But Clearchus pressed his proposal with\r\ngreat vehemence, till he at length succeeded in getting five generals\r\nand twenty captains to go; and some of the other soldiers followed them,\r\nto the number of about two hundred, as if for the purpose of\r\nmarketing.[113]\r\n\r\n31. When they had arrived at the entrance of Tissaphernes' tent, the\r\ngenerals, who were Proxenus the Bœotian, Menon the Thessalian, Agias\r\nthe Arcadian, Clearchus the Lacedæmonian, and Socrates the Achæan, were\r\ninvited to enter; but the captains waited at the door. 32. Not long\r\nafter, at one and the same signal, those within were seized, and those\r\nwithout massacred; and immediately afterwards a body of Barbarian\r\ncavalry, riding through the plain, killed every Greek, slave or freeman,\r\nthat they met.\r\n\r\n33. The Greeks, observing the motions of these cavalry from the camp,\r\nwere filled with astonishment, and wondered what they could be doing,\r\ntill Nicarchus an Arcadian came fleeing thither, wounded in the belly\r\nand holding his intestines in his hands, and related all that had\r\noccurred. 34. The Greeks, in consequence, ran to their arms in a state\r\nof general consternation, expecting that the enemy would immediately\r\nmarch upon the camp. 35. They however did not all come, but only Ariæus\r\nand Artaozus and Mithridates, who had been Cyrus's most confidential\r\nfriends; and the interpreter of the Greeks said, that he saw with them,\r\nand recognised, the brother of Tissaphernes. Other Persians, equipped\r\nwith corslets, to the number of three hundred, were in attendance on\r\nthem. 36. As they approached the camp, they called for whatever general\r\nor captain of the Greeks might be there, to come out to them, that they\r\nmight deliver a message from the king. 37. There accordingly went forth\r\nto them, with much caution, Cleanor the Orchomenian, and Sophænetus the\r\nStymphalian, generals of the Greeks, and with them Xenophon the\r\nAthenian, that he might learn news of Proxenus. As for Cheirisophus, he\r\nhappened to be absent at some village looking for provisions.\r\n\r\n38. When they had stopped just within hearing, Ariæus said to them:\r\n\"Clearchus, O Greeks, having been found guilty of perjury, and of\r\nviolating the truce, has received his just punishment, and is dead;\r\nProxenus and Menon, as having denounced his treachery, are in great\r\nhonour; but the king demands of you your arms; for he says that they are\r\nhis, as they belonged to Cyrus his subject.\" 39. To this the Greeks\r\nanswered, (Cleanor the Orchomenian spoke for them,) \"O Ariæus, most\r\nwicked of men, and the rest of you, as many as were the friends of\r\nCyrus, have you no regard either for gods or men, that, after having\r\nsworn that you would consider our friends and enemies to be likewise\r\nyours, you have thus,[114] after treacherously deserting us in concert\r\nwith Tissaphernes, the most godless and most unprincipled of human\r\nbeings, murdered the very men to whom you swore alliance, and,\r\nabandoning us who are left, have come against us in conjunction with our\r\nenemies?\" 40. Ariæus replied, \"Clearchus had been previously detected in\r\ntreacherous designs against Tissaphernes and Orontes, and all of us who\r\naccompany them.\" 41. To this Xenophon rejoined, \"Clearchus, then, if he\r\ninfringed the truce in violation of his oath, is deservedly punished;\r\nfor it is just that those who violate their oaths should suffer death;\r\nbut as for Proxenus and Menon, as they are your benefactors and our\r\ngenerals, send them hither; for it is clear that, being friends to both\r\nparties, they will endeavour to advise what is best both for you and for\r\nus.\" 42. The Barbarians, after conversing among themselves for some\r\ntime, departed without making any answer to this proposal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Οὔτ' ἀπὸ ποίου ἀν τάχους φεύγων τις ἀποφύγοι.] This is\r\nDindorf's reading. Bornemann and Kühner have οὔτ' ἀπὸ ποίου ἀν τάχους\r\nοὔτε ὅποι ἀν τις φεύγων ἀποφύγοι, on the authority, as they say, of the\r\nbest copies. Dindorf thought with Schæfer, ad Greg. Cor. p. 492, that\r\nthe words οὔτε ὅποι ἀν were superfluous, and consequently omitted them.\r\nBornemann and Kühner see no reason why they should not be retained.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: Τὸν μέγιστον ἔφεδρον.] Ἔφεδρος properly meant a gladiator\r\nor wrestler, who, when two combatants were engaged, stood ready to\r\nattack the one that should prove victorious. See Sturz. Lex. Xen.;\r\nSchol. in Soph. Aj. 610; Hesychius; D'Orvill. ad Charit. p. 338.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: Ἀναστρέφοιο.] \"Ut dominus versere, vivias, domini partes\r\nsustineas:\" Ἀν must be repeated from the preceding clause; unless that\r\nparticle, as Dindorf thinks, has dropped out from before ἀναστρέφοιο.\r\n_Kühner_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: There is in the text, as Krüger observes, a confusion of\r\nthe two constructions, ἀκούσαιμι τὸ ὄνομα τούτου, ὅστις, and ἀκούσαιμι,\r\nτις.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Ἅ ἡμῖν φίλια ὄντα.] I have here departed from Dindorf's\r\ntext, which has ἅ ὑμεῖς φίλια ὄντα, κ. τ. λ.; a reading much less\r\nsatisfactory than the other, to which Schneider, Bornemann, and Kühner\r\nadhere.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Ταμιεύεσθαι.] This word is used in the same sense, 3. 47;\r\niv. 1. 18; Thucyd. vi. 18; Plutarch, Timol. c. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Τὴν δ' ἐπὶ τῇ καρδιᾳ ---- ἔχοι.] Sc. ὄρθην. The sense is,\r\n\"but to wear a tiara erect on the heart, that is, to have a kingly\r\nspirit and to aspire to dominion, is what another, by your aid, might be\r\nable to do.\" Tissaphernes, by this expression, wished to make it\r\nunderstood that he might possibly, with the support of the Greeks,\r\naspire to the throne of Persia himself. A similar metaphor is noticed by\r\nSchæfer, (ad Greg. Corinth. p. 491.) in Philostratus v. a. iii. p. 131:\r\nδοκεῖ μοι καὶ τὸν προγνωσόμενον ἄνορ ὑγιῶς ἑαυτοῦ ἔχειν ----' καθαρῶς δὲ\r\nαὐτὸν προφητεύειν, ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τοῦ περὶ τῷ στέρνῳ τρίποδος συνιέντος.\r\n_Kühner_. See Cyrop. viii. 3. 13. Hutchison refers to Dion Chrysost.\r\nxiv. extr. Lucian Piscat. p. 213. See also Strabo, xv. p. 231, where the\r\nPersian tiara is said to be πίλημα πυργωτόν, in the shape of a tower;\r\nand Joseph. Ant. xx. 3. \"The tiaras of the king's subjects were soft and\r\nflexible: Schol. ad Plat. de Repub.\" _Krüger_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: Ὡς εἰς ἀγορὰν.] \"Consequently unarmed.\" _Krüger_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Ὡς ἀπολωλέκατε.] Jacobs interprets ὡς by quàm, as\r\nequivalent to quàm turpiter! quàm impiè! But such exclamations belong\r\nrather to modern writers than to the ancients. * * * Others have\r\nconjectured ἀθέως, ἀνοσίως, ὠμῶς, ἵσως, ὅλως, οὕτως. In one manuscript\r\nὡς is omitted; an omission approved by Larcher, Porson and some others.\r\nSome, too, think that the sentence is ἀνακόλουθος, and that the author,\r\nforgetful how he commenced it, goes on with ὡς for ὅτι. Dindorf supposes\r\nthat Cleanor must be regarded as too much provoked and agitated to mind\r\nthe exact arrangement of his words. For my own part, I consider that\r\nthose have the most reason on their side who think that we should read\r\nοὕτως, interpreting it, with Bornemann, _so rashly, so unjustifiably_.\r\nFrom οὕτως, written compendiously, ὡς might easily have sprung.\r\n_Kühner_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     The characters of the five generals that were put to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The generals, who were thus made prisoners, were taken up to the\r\nking, and put to death by being beheaded.\r\n\r\nOne of them, Clearchus, by the general consent of all who were\r\nacquainted with him, appears to have been a man well qualified for war,\r\nand extremely fond of military enterprise. 2. For as long as the\r\nLacedæmonians were at war with the Athenians, he remained in the service\r\nof his country; but when the peace took place, having induced his\r\ngovernment to believe that the Thracians were committing ravages on the\r\nGreeks, and having gained his point, as well as he could, with the\r\nEphori, he sailed from home to make war upon the Thracians that lie\r\nabove the Chersonesus and Perinthus. 3. But when the Ephori, after he\r\nwas gone, having for some reason changed their mind, took measures to\r\noblige him to turn back from the Isthmus, he then no longer paid\r\nobedience to their commands, but sailed away to the Hellespont, 4. and\r\nwas in consequence condemned to death, for disobedience, by the chief\r\nmagistrates at Sparta. Being then an exile, he went to Cyrus; and by\r\nwhat methods he conciliated the favour of Cyrus, has been told in\r\nanother place. Cyrus presented him with ten thousand darics; 5. and he,\r\non receiving that sum, did not give himself up to idleness, but having\r\ncollected an army with the money, made war upon the Thracians, and\r\nconquered them in battle, and from that time plundered and laid waste\r\ntheir country, and continued this warfare till Cyrus had need of his\r\narmy; when he went to him, for the purpose of again making war in\r\nconcert with him.\r\n\r\n6. These seem to me to have been the proceedings of one fond of war,\r\nwho, when he might have lived in peace without disgrace or loss, chose\r\nwar in preference; when he might have spent his time in idleness,\r\nvoluntarily underwent toil for the sake of military adventure; and when\r\nhe might have enjoyed riches in security, chose rather, by engaging in\r\nwarfare, to diminish their amount. He was indeed led by inclination to\r\nspend his money in war, as he might have spent it in pursuits of\r\ngallantry, or any other pleasure; to such a degree was he fond of war.\r\n7. He appears also to have been qualified for military undertakings, as\r\nhe liked perilous adventure, was ready to march day and night against\r\nthe enemy, and was possessed of great presence of mind in circumstances\r\nof difficulty, as those who were with him on all such occasions were\r\nuniversally ready to acknowledge.\r\n\r\n8. For commanding troops he was said to be qualified in as great a\r\ndegree as was consistent with his temper; for he was excelled by no one\r\nin ability to contrive how an army might have provisions, and to procure\r\nthem; and he was equally fitted to impress on all around him the\r\nnecessity of obeying Clearchus. 9. This he effected by severity; for he\r\nwas of a stern countenance and harsh voice; and he always punished\r\nviolently, and sometimes in anger, so that he occasionally repented of\r\nwhat he had done. He punished too on principle, for he thought that\r\nthere could be no efficiency in an army undisciplined by chastisement.\r\n10. He is also reported to have said, that a soldier ought to fear his\r\ncommander more than the enemy, if he would either keep guard well, or\r\nabstain from doing injury to friends, or march without hesitation\r\nagainst foes. 11. In circumstances of danger, accordingly, the soldiers\r\nwere willing to obey him implicitly, and wished for no other leader; for\r\nthey said, that the sternness in his countenance then assumed an\r\nappearance of cheerfulness, and that what was severe in it seemed\r\nundauntedness against the enemy; so that it appeared indicative of\r\nsafety, and not of austerity. 12. But when they were out of danger, and\r\nwere at liberty to betake themselves to other chiefs, they deserted him\r\nin great numbers; for he had nothing attractive in him, but was always\r\nforbidding and repulsive, so that the soldiers felt towards him as boys\r\ntowards their master. 13. Hence it was, that he never had any one who\r\nfollowed him out of friendship and attachment to his person; though such\r\nas followed him from being appointed to the service by their country, or\r\nfrom being compelled by want or other necessity, he found extremely\r\nsubmissive to him. 14. And when they began under his command to gain\r\nvictories over the enemy, there were many important circumstances that\r\nconcurred to render his troops excellent soldiers; for their perfect\r\nconfidence against the enemy had its effect, and their dread of\r\npunishment from him rendered them strictly observant of discipline. 15.\r\nSuch was his character as a commander. But he was said to have been by\r\nno means willing to be commanded by others. When he was put to death, he\r\nwas about fifty years of age.\r\n\r\n16. Proxenus the Bœotian, from his earliest youth, felt a desire to\r\nbecome a man capable of great undertakings; and through this desire paid\r\nGorgias of Leontium for instruction. 17. When he had passed some time\r\nwith him, and thought himself capable of command, and, if honoured with\r\nthe friendship of the great, of making no inadequate return for their\r\nfavours, he proceeded to take a part in this enterprise with Cyrus; and\r\nexpected to acquire in it a great name, extensive influence, and\r\nabundant wealth. 18. But though he earnestly wished for these things, he\r\nat the same time plainly showed, that he was unwilling to acquire any of\r\nthem by injustice, but that he thought he ought to obtain them by just\r\nand honourable means, or otherwise not at all.\r\n\r\n19. He was indeed able to command orderly and well-disposed men, but\r\nincapable of inspiring ordinary soldiers with either respect or fear for\r\nhim; he stood even more in awe of those under his command, than they of\r\nhim; and evidently showed that he was more afraid of being disliked by\r\nhis soldiers, than his soldiers of being disobedient to him. 20. He\r\nthought it sufficient both for being, and appearing, capable of command,\r\nto praise him who did well, and withhold his praise from the offender.\r\nSuch, therefore, of his followers, as were of honourable and virtuous\r\ncharacter, were much attached to him, but the unprincipled formed\r\ndesigns upon him, as a man easy to manage. He was about thirty years old\r\nwhen he was put to death.\r\n\r\n21. As for Menon the Thessalian, he ever manifested an excessive desire\r\nfor riches, being desirous of command that he might receive greater pay,\r\nand desirous of honours that he might obtain greater perquisites; and he\r\nwished to be well with those in power, in order that when he did wrong\r\nhe might not suffer punishment. 22. To accomplish what he desired, he\r\nthought that the shortest road lay through perjury, falsehood, and\r\ndeceit; while sincerity and truth he regarded as no better than folly.\r\n23. He evidently had no affection for any man; and as for those to whom\r\nhe professed to be a friend, he was unmistakeably plotting mischief\r\nagainst them. He never ridiculed an enemy, but always used to talk with\r\nhis associates as if ridiculing all of them.[115] 24. He formed no\r\ndesigns on the property of his enemies, (for he thought it difficult to\r\ntake what belonged to such as were on their guard against him,) but\r\nlooked upon himself as the only person sensible how very easy it was to\r\ninvade the unguarded property of friends.\r\n\r\n25. Those whom he saw given to perjury and injustice, he feared as men\r\nwell armed; but sought to practise on those who were pious and observant\r\nof truth, as imbeciles. 26. As another might take a pride in religion,\r\nand truth, and justice, so Menon took a pride in being able to deceive,\r\nin devising falsehoods, in sneering at friends; and thought the man who\r\nwas guileless was to be regarded as deficient in knowledge of the world.\r\nHe believed that he must conciliate those, in whose friendship he\r\nwished to stand first, by calumniating such as already held the chief\r\nplace in their favour. 27. The soldiers he tried to render obedient to\r\nhim by being an accomplice in their dishonesty. He expected to be\r\nhonoured and courted, by showing that he had the power and the will to\r\ninflict the greatest injuries. When any one deserted him, he spoke of it\r\nas a favour on his own part that, while he made use of his services, he\r\ndid not work his destruction.\r\n\r\n28. As to such parts of his history as are little known, I might, if I\r\nwere to speak of them, say something untrue of him; but those which\r\nevery one knows, are these. While yet in the prime of youth he obtained,\r\nat the hands of Aristippus, the command of his corps of mercenaries. He\r\nwas also, in his prime, most intimate with Ariæus, though a Barbarian,\r\nas Ariæus delighted in beautiful youths. He himself, too, while yet a\r\nbeardless youth, made a favourite of Tharypas, who had arrived at\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\n29. When his fellow-officers were put to death, because they had served\r\nwith Cyrus against the king, he, though he had done the same, was not\r\nput to death with them; but after the death of the other generals, he\r\ndied under a punishment inflicted by the king, not like Clearchus and\r\nthe other commanders, who were beheaded (which appears to be the\r\nspeediest kind of death); but after living a year in torture, like a\r\nmalefactor, he is said at length to have met his end.\r\n\r\n30. Agias the Arcadian and Socrates the Achæan were also put to death.\r\nThese no one ever derided as wanting courage in battle, or blamed for\r\ntheir conduct towards their friends. They were both about five and\r\nthirty years of age.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Τῶν δὲ συνόντων, κ. τ. λ.] By a species of attraction for\r\nτοῖς δὲ συνοῦσι πᾶσιν, ὡς καταγελῶν αὐτῶν, ἀεὶ διελέγετο. _Kühner_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n     Dejection of the Greeks. How Xenophon was led to join in Cyrus's\r\n     expedition. His dream, and reflections. He rouses the captains of\r\n     the division that Proxenus had commanded, and exhorts them to take\r\n     measures for their safety. Apollonides deprived of his captaincy. A\r\n     general meeting of the surviving generals and captains, at which\r\n     Xenophon persuades them to choose new commanders in the room of\r\n     those that they had lost. Xenophon is one of those elected.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. What the Greeks did in their march up the country with Cyrus, until\r\nthe time of the battle, and what occurred after Cyrus was dead, when the\r\nGreeks set out to return with Tissaphernes in reliance on a truce, has\r\nbeen related in the preceding part of the work.\r\n\r\n2. After the generals were made prisoners, and such of the captains and\r\nsoldiers as had accompanied them were put to death, the Greeks were in\r\ngreat perplexity, reflecting that they were not far from the king's\r\nresidence;[116] that there were around them, on all sides, many hostile\r\nnations and cities; that no one would any longer secure them\r\nopportunities of purchasing provisions; that they were distant from\r\nGreece not less than ten thousand stadia; that there was no one to guide\r\nthem on the way; that impassable rivers would intercept them in the\r\nmidst of their course; that the Barbarians who had gone up with Cyrus\r\nhad deserted them; and that they were left utterly alone, having no\r\ncavalry to support them, so that it was certain, even if they defeated\r\ntheir enemies, that they would kill not a man of them, and that, if they\r\nwere defeated, none of themselves would be left alive;--3. reflecting, I\r\nsay, on these circumstances, and being disheartened at them, few of them\r\ntasted food for that evening,[117] few kindled fires, and many did not\r\ncome to the place of arms[118] during the night, but lay down to rest\r\nwhere they severally happened to be, unable to sleep for sorrow and\r\nlonging for their country, their parents, their wives and children, whom\r\nthey never expected to see again. In this state of mind they all went to\r\ntheir resting-places.\r\n\r\n4. There was in the army a certain Xenophon, an Athenian, who\r\naccompanied it neither in the character of general, nor captain, nor\r\ncommon soldier, but it had happened that Proxenus, an old guest-friend\r\nof his, had sent for him from home, giving him a promise that, if he\r\ncame, he would recommend him to the friendship of Cyrus, whom he\r\nconsidered, he said, as a greater object of regard than his own country.\r\n5. Xenophon, on reading the letter, consulted Socrates the Athenian, as\r\nto the propriety of making the journey; and Socrates, fearing that if he\r\nattached himself to Cyrus it might prove a ground for accusation against\r\nhim with his country, because Cyrus was thought to have zealously\r\nassisted the Lacedæmonians in their war with Athens, advised Xenophon to\r\ngo to Delphi, and consult the god respecting the expedition. 6.\r\nXenophon, having gone thither accordingly, inquired of Apollo to which\r\nof the gods he should sacrifice and pray, in order most honourably and\r\nsuccessfully to perform the journey which he contemplated, and, after\r\nprosperously accomplishing it, to return in safety. Apollo answered him\r\nthat \"he should sacrifice to the gods to whom it was proper for him to\r\nsacrifice.\"[119] 7. When he returned, he repeated the oracle to\r\nSocrates, who, on hearing it, blamed him for not asking Apollo in the\r\nfirst place, whether it were better for him to go or stay at home;\r\nwhereas, having settled with himself that he would go, he only asked how\r\nhe might best go; \"but since you have,\" said he, \"put the question thus,\r\nyou must do what the god has directed.\" 8. Xenophon, therefore, having\r\nsacrificed to the gods that Apollo commanded, set sail, and found\r\nProxenus and Cyrus at Sardis, just setting out on their march up the\r\ncountry, and was presented to Cyrus. 9. Proxenus desiring that he should\r\nremain with them, Cyrus joined in the same desire, and said that as soon\r\nas the expedition was ended, he would send him home again. The\r\nexpedition was said to be intended against the Pisidians. 10. Xenophon\r\naccordingly joined in the enterprise, being thus deceived, but not by\r\nProxenus; for he did not know that the movement was against the king,\r\nnor did any other of the Greeks, except Clearchus. When they arrived in\r\nCilicia, however, it appeared manifest to every one that it was against\r\nthe king that their force was directed; but, though they were afraid of\r\nthe length of the journey, and unwilling to proceed, yet the greater\r\npart of them, out of respect[120] both for one another and for Cyrus,\r\ncontinued to follow him; of which number was Xenophon.\r\n\r\n11. When this perplexity occurred, Xenophon was distressed as well as\r\nthe other Greeks, and unable to rest, but having at length got a little\r\nsleep, he had a dream, in which, in the midst of a thunder-storm, a bolt\r\nseemed to him to fall upon his father's house, and the house in\r\nconsequence became all in a blaze. 12. Being greatly frightened, he\r\nimmediately awoke, and considered his dream as in one respect\r\nfavourable, (inasmuch as, being in troubles and dangers, he seemed to\r\nbehold a great light from Jupiter,) but in another respect he was\r\nalarmed, (because the dream appeared to him to be from Jupiter who was a\r\nking, and the fire to blaze all around him,) lest he should be unable to\r\nescape from the king's territories, but should be hemmed in on all sides\r\nby inextricable difficulties.\r\n\r\n13. What it betokens, however, to see such a dream, we may conjecture\r\nfrom the occurrences that happened after the dream. What immediately\r\nfollowed was this. As soon as he awoke, the thought that first occurred\r\nto him was, \"Why do I lie here? The night is passing away. With daylight\r\nit is probable that the enemy will come upon us; and if we once fall\r\ninto the hands of the king, what is there to prevent us from being put\r\nto death with ignominy, after witnessing the most grievous sufferings\r\namong our comrades, and enduring every severity of torture ourselves?\r\n14. Yet no one concerts measures, or takes thought, for our defence, but\r\nwe lie still, as if we were at liberty to enjoy repose. From what city,\r\nthen, do I expect a leader to undertake our defence? What age am I\r\nwaiting for to come to myself? Assuredly I shall never be older, if I\r\ngive myself up to the enemy to-day.\" 15. After these reflections he\r\narose, and called together, in the first place, the captains that were\r\nunder Proxenus.\r\n\r\nWhen they were assembled, he said, \"For my part, captains, I cannot\r\nsleep, nor, I should think, can you, nor can I lie still any longer,\r\nwhen I consider in what circumstances we are placed; 16. for it is plain\r\nthat the enemy did not openly manifest hostility towards us, until they\r\nthought that they had judiciously arranged their plans; but on our side\r\nno one takes any thought how we may best maintain a contest with them.\r\n17. Yet if we prove remiss, and fall into the power of the king, what\r\nmay we not expect to suffer from a man who cut off the head and hand of\r\nhis own brother by the same mother and father, even after he was dead,\r\nand fixed them upon a stake? What may not we, I say, expect to suffer,\r\nwho have no relative[121] to take our part, and who have marched against\r\nhim to make him a subject instead of a monarch, and to put him to death\r\nif it should lie in our power? 18. Will he not proceed to every\r\nextremity, that by reducing us to the last degree of ignominious\r\nsuffering, he may inspire all men with a dread of ever taking the field\r\nagainst him? We must however try every expedient not to fall into his\r\nhands. 19. For myself, I never ceased, while the truce lasted, to\r\nconsider ourselves as objects of pity, and to regard the king and his\r\npeople as objects of envy, as I contemplated how extensive and valuable\r\na country they possessed, how great an abundance of provisions, how many\r\nslaves and cattle, and how vast a quantity of gold and raiment; 20.\r\nwhile, on the other hand, when I reflected on the condition of our own\r\nsoldiers, that we had no share in any of all these blessings, unless we\r\nbought it, and knew that few of us had any longer money to buy, and that\r\nour oaths restrained us from getting provisions otherwise than by\r\nbuying, I sometimes, on taking all these circumstances into\r\nconsideration, feared the continuance of peace more than I now fear war.\r\n21. But since they have put an end to peace, their own haughtiness, and\r\nour mistrust, seem likewise to be brought to an end; for the advantages\r\nwhich I have mentioned lie now as prizes between us, for whichsoever of\r\nus shall prove the better men; and the gods are the judges of the\r\ncontest, who, as is just, will be on our side; 22. since the enemy have\r\noffended them by perjury, while we, though seeing many good things to\r\ntempt us, have resolutely abstained from all of them through regard to\r\nour oaths; so that, as it seems to me, we may advance to the combat with\r\nmuch greater confidence than they can feel. 23. We have bodies,\r\nmoreover, better able than theirs to endure cold and heat and toil; and\r\nwe have, with the help of the gods, more resolute minds; while the\r\nenemy, if the gods, as before, grant us success, will be found more\r\nobnoxious to wounds and death[122] than we are. 24. But possibly others\r\nof you entertain the same thoughts; let us not, then, in the name of\r\nheaven, wait for others to come and exhort us to noble deeds, but let us\r\nbe ourselves the first to excite others to exert their valour. Prove\r\nyourselves the bravest of the captains, and more worthy to lead than\r\nthose who are now leaders. 25. As for me, if you wish to take the start\r\nin the course, I am willing to follow you, or, if you appoint me to be a\r\nleader, I shall not make my youth an excuse, but shall think myself\r\nsufficiently mature to defend myself against harm.\"\r\n\r\n26. Thus spoke Xenophon; and the captains, on hearing his observations,\r\nall desired him to be their leader, except a certain Apollonides, who\r\nresembled a Bœotian in his manner of speaking; this man said that\r\n\"whoever asserted they could gain safety by any other means than by\r\nobtaining, if he could, the king's consent to it, talked absurdly;\" and\r\nat the same time began to enumerate the difficulties surrounding them.\r\n27. But Xenophon, interrupting him, said, \"O most wonderful of men! you\r\nneither understand what you see, nor remember what you hear. Yet you\r\nwere on the same spot with those here present, when the king, after\r\nCyrus was dead, being in high spirits at the circumstance, sent to\r\ndemand that we should deliver up our arms; 28. and when we, refusing to\r\ndeliver them up, and appearing in full armour, went and encamped over\r\nagainst him, what means did he not try, sending deputies, asking for a\r\ntruce, and supplying us with provisions until he obtained a truce? 29.\r\nBut when, on the other hand, our generals and captains went to confer\r\nwith the Barbarians, as you now advise us to do, without their arms, and\r\nrelying on the truce, were they not beaten, goaded, insulted, and are\r\nthey not unable, wretched men, to die, though, I should think, greatly\r\nlonging for death? And do you, knowing all these occurrences, say that\r\nthose who exhort us to defend ourselves talk absurdly, and advise us to\r\ngo again to try persuasion? 30. To me, O captains, it seems that we\r\nshould no longer admit this man into the same service with ourselves,\r\nbut take from him his captaincy, and laying baggage on his back, make\r\nuse of him in that capacity; for he disgraces both his own country and\r\nall Greece, inasmuch as, being a Greek, he is of such a character.\" 31.\r\nHere Agasias of Stymphalus, proceeding to speak, said, \"But this man,\r\nassuredly, has nothing to do either with Bœotia or with Greece at\r\nall, for I have observed that he has both his ears bored, like a\r\nLydian.\" Such indeed was the case; and they accordingly expelled him.\r\n\r\n32. The rest, proceeding to the different divisions of the troops,\r\ncalled up the general wherever there was a general surviving, and the\r\nlieutenant-general[123] where the general was dead, and the captain\r\nwherever there was a captain surviving. 33. When they were all come\r\ntogether, they sat down before the place where the arms were piled;[124]\r\nand the generals and captains assembled were about a hundred in all. The\r\ntime when the meeting took place was about midnight.\r\n\r\n34. Hieronymus, a native of Elis, the oldest of all the captains that\r\nhad served under Proxenus, was the first to speak, as follows: \"It has\r\nseemed proper to us, O generals and captains, on contemplating the\r\npresent state of our affairs, to meet together ourselves, and to call\r\nupon you to join us, that we may determine, if we can, on some plan for\r\nour benefit. But do you, Xenophon, first represent to the assembly what\r\nyou have already observed to us.\" 35. Xenophon accordingly said, \"We are\r\nall aware that the king and Tissaphernes have made prisoners of as many\r\nof us as they could; and it is evident that they are forming designs\r\nagainst the rest of us, that they may put us to death if they can. But\r\non our parts I think that every means should be adopted in order that we\r\nmay not fall into the Barbarians' hands, but rather that they, if we can\r\naccomplish it, may fall into ours. 36. Be well assured, then, that you,\r\nwho have now met together in such numbers, have upon you a most\r\nimportant responsibility;[125] for all the soldiers look to you, and, if\r\nthey see you dispirited, they will themselves lose courage, but if both\r\nyou yourselves appear well prepared to meet the enemy, and exhort others\r\nto be equally prepared, be certain that they will follow you, and strive\r\nto imitate you. 37. Perhaps, too, it is right that you should show some\r\nsuperiority over them; for you are their generals, their officers, and\r\ntheir captains, and, when there was peace, you enjoyed advantages over\r\nthem in fortune and honour; and now, in consequence, when war arises,\r\nyou ought to prove yourselves pre-eminent over the multitude, and to\r\ntake the lead in forming plans for them, and, should it ever be\r\nnecessary, in toiling for them. 38. And, in the first place, I think\r\nthat you will greatly benefit the army, if you take care that generals\r\nand captains be chosen as soon as possible in the room of those whom we\r\nhave lost; for without commanders nothing honourable or advantageous can\r\nbe achieved, I may say in one word, anywhere, but least of all in the\r\nfield of battle. Good order conduces to safety, but want of order has\r\nalready proved fatal to many. 39. Again, when you have appointed as many\r\ncommanders as are requisite, I consider that if you were to assemble\r\nand encourage the rest of the soldiers, you would act very suitably to\r\nthe occasion; 40. for you perhaps observe, as well as myself, how\r\ndejectedly they have now come to the place of arms,[126] and how\r\ndejectedly they go upon guard, so that, while they are in such a\r\ncondition, I know not for what service any one could employ them,\r\nwhether required by night or by day. 41. But if any one could change the\r\ndirection of their thoughts, so that they may not merely contemplate\r\nwhat they are likely to suffer, but what they may be able to do, they\r\nwill become much more eager for action; 42. for you are certain that it\r\nis neither numbers nor strength which gives the victory in war, but that\r\nwhichsoever side advances on the enemy with the more resolute courage,\r\ntheir opponents, in general, cannot withstand their onset. 43. I have\r\nalso remarked, fellow-soldiers, that such as are eager in the field to\r\npreserve their lives at any rate, for the most part perish wretchedly\r\nand ignominiously, while I see that such as reflect that death is to all\r\nmen common and inevitable, and seek in battle only to fall with honour,\r\nmore frequently, from whatever cause, arrive at old age, and live, while\r\nthey live, with greater happiness. 44. Being aware, then, of these\r\nfacts, it behoves us, such are the circumstances in which we are placed,\r\nboth to prove ourselves to be brave soldiers, and to exhort others to be\r\nso likewise.\" 45. Having spoken thus, he stopped.\r\n\r\nAfter him Cheirisophus said, \"Till the present moment, O Xenophon, I\r\nknew nothing of you, except having heard that you were an Athenian, but\r\nnow I have to praise you both for what you say and what you do and could\r\nwish that there were very many like you; for it would be a general good.\r\n46. And now,\" he added, \"let us not delay, my fellow-soldiers, but\r\nproceed at once, you who want them, to choose commanders, and when you\r\nhave elected them, come to the centre of the camp, and bring those that\r\nare chosen; and we will then call the rest of the soldiers together\r\nthere. And let Tolmides the herald,\" said he, \"come with us.\" 47. As he\r\nsaid this, he rose up, that the necessary measures might not be delayed,\r\nbut carried at once into execution. There were accordingly chosen\r\ncommanders, Timasion a Dardanian in the room of Clearchus, Xanthicles an\r\nAchæan in that of Socrates, Cleanor an Arcadian in that of Agias,\r\nPhilesius an Achæan in that of Menon, and Xenophon of Athens in that of\r\nProxenus.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Ἐπὶ ταῖς βασιλέως θύραις.] See ii. 4. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Εἰς τὴν ἑσπέραν.] _Vespertino tempore_.

They were therefore certain or appointed gods: comp. sect. 8;\r\nand vi. i. 22. Yet the absence of the article ought not to surprise us,\r\neven when special gods are meant. _Kühner_.--What gods they were, does\r\nnot appear.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Δι' αἰσχύνην.] They had regard for their character in the\r\neyes of one another, fearing that they might seem faint-hearted; and\r\nregard for it in those of Cyrus, fearing that they might seem\r\nungrateful. _Kühner_.--Αἰσχύνη is self-respect, apprehension of what\r\nothers may think of us; and may be illustrated by Hom.

The speeches of\r\n     Cheirisophus, Cleanor, and Xenophon. The order of march is settled,\r\n     and the duties of each commander appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. When the officers were chosen, and day was just dawning, they met in\r\nthe centre of the camp, and it was resolved to station sentinels at the\r\nout-posts, and to call together the soldiers. When the rest of the\r\ntroops came up, Cheirisophus the Lacedæmonian rose first, and spoke as\r\nfollows: 2. \"Our present circumstances, fellow-soldiers, are fraught\r\nwith difficulty, since we are deprived of such able generals, and\r\ncaptains, and soldiers, and since, also, the party of Ariæus, who were\r\nformerly our supporters, have deserted us; 3. yet it behoves us to\r\nextricate ourselves from these difficulties as brave men, and not to\r\nlose courage, but to endeavour to save ourselves, if we can, by an\r\nhonourable victory; but if we cannot do so, let us at least die with\r\nhonour, and never, while we live, put ourselves into the power of the\r\nenemy; for I think that, in that case, we should endure such sufferings\r\nas I wish that the gods may inflict on our adversaries.\"\r\n\r\n4. After him Cleanor the Orchomenian arose and spoke thus: \"You see,\r\nsoldiers, the perjury and impiety of the king; and you see also the\r\nfaithlessness of Tissaphernes, who, after telling us that he was a\r\nneighbour of the Greeks, and would esteem it the highest privilege to\r\nsave us, and after having given us his right hand as a pledge, has\r\nhimself deceived and made prisoners our generals, and has not respected\r\neven Jupiter, the protector of the rights of hospitality, but,\r\nentertaining Clearchus at his own table, has, by this very means,\r\ninveigled and destroyed our officers. 5. Ariæus, too, whom we offered to\r\nmake king, to whom we gave and from whom we received pledges, that we\r\nwould not betray one another, even he, neither fearing the gods, nor\r\nrespecting the memory of Cyrus, though honoured by him in the highest\r\ndegree while he was alive, has now gone over to his bitterest enemies,\r\nand endeavours to distress us who were his friends. 6. But on these men\r\nmay the gods take vengeance; for ourselves, it is incumbent upon us,\r\nhaving this conduct before our eyes, not to be deceived again by them,\r\nbut, after fighting as bravely as we can, to bear with patience such\r\nfortune as the gods may appoint us.\"\r\n\r\n7. Next stood up Xenophon, who had accoutred himself for war as\r\nsplendidly as he could, thinking that if the gods should grant them\r\nvictory, the finest equipment would be suitable to success, or that, if\r\nit were appointed for him to die, it would be well for him to adorn\r\nhimself with his best armour,[127] and in that dress to meet his end. He\r\nproceeded to speak thus: 8. \"Of the perjury and perfidy of the\r\nBarbarians Cleanor has just spoken, and you, I am sure, are well aware\r\nof it. If, then, we think of coming again to terms of friendship with\r\nthem, we must of necessity feel much distrust on that head, when we see\r\nwhat our generals have suffered, who, in reliance on their faith, put\r\nthemselves into their hands; but if we propose to inflict on them\r\nvengeance with our swords for what they have done, and, for the future,\r\nto be at war with them at all points, we have, with the help of the\r\ngods, many fair hopes of safety.\" 9. As he was uttering these words,\r\nsomebody sneezed, and the soldiers, hearing it, with one impulse paid\r\ntheir adoration to the god;[128] and Xenophon continued, \"Since,\r\nsoldiers, while we were speaking of safety, an omen from Jupiter the\r\nPreserver has appeared, it seems to me that we should vow to that god to\r\noffer sacrifices for our preservation on the spot where we first reach a\r\nfriendly country; and that we should vow, at the same time, to sacrifice\r\nto the other gods according to our ability. And to whomsoever this seems\r\nreasonable, let him hold up his hand.\" All held up their hands; and they\r\nthen made their vows, and sang the pæan. When the ceremonies to the gods\r\nwere duly performed, he recommenced thus: 10. \"I was saying that we had\r\nmany fair hopes of safety. In the first place, we have observed our\r\noaths made to the gods; but the enemy have perjured themselves, and\r\nbroken the truce and their oaths. Such being the case, it is natural\r\nthat the gods should be unfavourable to our enemies, and should fight on\r\nour side; the gods, who are able, whenever they will, to make the mighty\r\nsoon weak, and to save the weak with ease, although they be in grievous\r\nperils. 11. In the next place, I will remind you of the dangers in which\r\nour ancestors were, that you may feel conscious how much it becomes you\r\nto be brave, and how the brave are preserved, even from the greatest\r\ntroubles, by the aid of the gods. For when the Persians, and those\r\nunited with them, came with a numerous host, as if to sweep Athens from\r\nthe face of the earth,[129] the Athenians, by daring to oppose them,\r\ngave them a defeat; 12. and having made a vow to Diana, that whatever\r\nnumber they should kill of the enemy, they would sacrifice to her\r\ndivinity the same number of goats, and not being able to find enough,\r\nthey resolved to sacrifice five hundred every year; and to this day they\r\nstill continue to sacrifice them. 13. Again, when Xerxes, having\r\ncollected that innumerable army of his, came down upon Greece a second\r\ntime, our ancestors on that occasion, too, defeated the ancestors of\r\nthese Barbarians, both by land and sea; of which exploits the trophies\r\nare still to be seen as memorials; the greatest of all memorials,\r\nhowever, is the liberty of the states in which you were born and bred,\r\nfor you worship no man as master, but the gods alone. Of such ancestors\r\nare you sprung.\r\n\r\n14. \"Nor am I going to say that you dishonour them. It is not yet many\r\ndays since you arrayed yourselves in the field against the descendants\r\nof those Barbarians, and defeated, with the help of the gods, a force\r\nmany times more numerous than yourselves. 15. On that occasion you\r\nshowed yourselves brave men to procure a throne for Cyrus; and now, when\r\nthe struggle is for your own lives, it becomes you to be more valiant\r\nand resolute. 16. At present, too, you may justly feel greater\r\nconfidence against your adversaries; for even then, when you had made no\r\ntrial of them, and saw them in countless numbers before you, you yet\r\ndared, with the spirit of your fathers, to advance upon them, and now,\r\nwhen you have learned from experience of them, that, though many times\r\nyour number, they shrink from receiving your charge, what reason have\r\nyou any longer to fear them? 17. And do not consider it any\r\ndisadvantage, that the troops of Cyrus, who were formerly arrayed on our\r\nside, have now left us; for they are far more cowardly than those who\r\nwere defeated by you; at least[130] they deserted us to flee to them,\r\nand those who are so ready to commence flight it is better to see posted\r\non the side of the enemy than in our own ranks.\r\n\r\n18. \"If, again, any of you are disheartened because we have no cavalry,\r\nand the enemy have a great number, consider that ten thousand cavalry\r\nare nothing more than ten thousand men; for no one ever perished in\r\nbattle of being bitten or kicked by a horse; it is the men that do\r\nwhatever is done in the encounter. 19. Doubtless we, too, rest upon a\r\nsurer support than cavalry have, for they are raised upon horses, and\r\nare afraid, not only of us, but also of falling, while we, taking our\r\nsteps upon the ground, shall strike such as approach us with far greater\r\nforce, and hit much more surely the mark at which we may aim. In one\r\npoint alone, indeed, have the cavalry the advantage, that it is safer\r\nfor them to flee than for us.\r\n\r\n20. \"But if, though you have courage for battle, you are disquieted at\r\nthe thought that Tissaphernes will no longer guide you, and that the\r\nking will no longer supply you with provisions, consider whether it is\r\nbetter to have Tissaphernes for our guide, who is manifestly plotting\r\nour destruction, or such persons as we ourselves may seize and compel to\r\nbe our guides, who will be conscious that if they go wrong with regard\r\nto us, they go wrong with regard to their own lives and persons. 21. And\r\nas to provisions, whether is it better for us to purchase, in the\r\nmarkets which they provide, small measures of food for large sums of\r\nmoney, (no longer, indeed, having the money,) or, if we are successful\r\nin the field, to take supplies for ourselves, adopting whatever measure\r\neach of us may wish to use?\r\n\r\n22. \"Again, if you think, that this state of things will be better, but\r\nimagine that the rivers will be impassable, and that you were greatly\r\nmisled when you came across them, reflect whether the Barbarians have\r\nnot acted most unwisely also in this respect.[131] For all rivers,\r\nthough they may be impassable at a distance from their sources, are easy\r\nto be forded by those who go to their springs, wetting them not even to\r\nthe knees. 23. But even if the rivers shall not afford us a\r\npassage,[132] and no guide shall appear to conduct us, we still need not\r\nbe in despair; for we know that the Mysians, whom we should not call\r\nmore valiant than ourselves, have settled themselves, against the king's\r\nwill, in many rich and large cities in the king's territory; we know\r\nthat the Pisidians have acted similarly; and we have ourselves seen[133]\r\nthat the Lycaonians, having seized on the strongholds in the plains,\r\nenjoy the produce of the land of these Barbarians; 24. and I should\r\nrecommend that we, for the present, should not let it be seen that we\r\nare eager to start homewards, but should apparently make arrangements as\r\nif we thought of settling somewhere in these parts; for I am sure that\r\nthe king would grant the Mysians many guides, and give them many\r\nhostages to send them out of the country safely, and even make roads for\r\nthem, though they should desire to depart in four-horse chariots; and\r\nfor ourselves, too, I am convinced that he would with thrice as much\r\npleasure do the same, if he saw us making dispositions to remain here.\r\n25. But I am afraid that if we should once learn to live in idleness, to\r\nrevel in abundance, and to associate with the fair and stately wives and\r\ndaughters of the Medes and Persians, we should, like the\r\nlotus-eaters,[134] think no more of the road homewards. 26. It seems to\r\nme, therefore, both reasonable and just, that we should first of all\r\nmake an attempt to return to Greece, and to the members of our families,\r\nand let our countrymen see that they live in voluntary poverty, since\r\nthey might see those, who are now living at home without due means of\r\nsubsistence, enriched on betaking themselves hither. But I need say no\r\nmore on this head, for it is plain, my fellow-soldiers, that all these\r\nadvantages fall to the conquerors.\r\n\r\n27. \"I must also suggest to you, however, in what manner we may proceed\r\non our way with the greatest safety, and how we may fight, if it should\r\nbe necessary to fight, to the greatest possible advantage. First of all,\r\nthen,\" he continued, \"it seems to me that we ought to burn whatever\r\ncarriages we have, that our cattle may not influence our movements, but\r\nthat we may march whithersoever it may be convenient for the army; and\r\nthen that we should burn our tents with them, for tents are troublesome\r\nto carry, and of no service either for fighting or in getting\r\nprovisions. 28. I think also that we ought to rid ourselves of whatever\r\nis superfluous in the rest of our baggage, reserving only what we have\r\nfor war, or for meat and drink, that as many of us as possible may be\r\nunder arms, and as few as possible baggage-bearers; for you are aware\r\nthat whatever belongs to the conquered becomes the property of others;\r\nand, if we are victorious, we ought to look upon the enemy as our\r\nbaggage-carriers.\r\n\r\n29. \"It only remains for me to mention a particular which I consider to\r\nbe of the greatest importance. You see that the enemy did not venture\r\nopenly to commence war against us, until they had seized our generals,\r\nthinking that as long as we had commanders, and were obedient to them,\r\nwe should be in a condition to gain the advantage over them in the\r\nfield, but, on making prisoners of our generals, they expected that we\r\nshould perish from want of direction and order. 30. It is incumbent,\r\ntherefore, on our present commanders to be far more vigilant than our\r\nformer ones, and on those under command to be far more orderly, and\r\nmore obedient to their officers, at present than they were before. 31.\r\nAnd if you were also to pass a resolution, that, should any one be\r\ndisobedient, whoever of you chances to light upon him is to join with\r\nhis officer in punishing him, the enemy would by that means be most\r\neffectually disappointed in their expectations, for, on the very day\r\nthat such resolution is passed, they will see before them ten thousand\r\nClearchuses instead of one, who will not allow a single soldier to play\r\nthe coward. 32. But it is now time for me to conclude my speech;[135]\r\nfor in an instant perhaps the enemy will be upon us. Whosoever,\r\ntherefore, thinks these suggestions reasonable, let him give his\r\nsanction to them at once, that they may be carried into execution. But\r\nif any other course, in any one's opinion, be better than this,[136] let\r\nhim, even though he be a private soldier, boldly give us his sentiments;\r\nfor the safety, which we all seek, is a general concern.\"\r\n\r\n33. Cheirisophus then said, \"Should there be need of any other measure\r\nin addition to what Xenophon proposes, it will be in our power to bring\r\nit forward by and by; what he has now suggested we ought, I think, to\r\nvote at once to be the best course that we can adopt; and to whomsoever\r\nthis seems proper, let him hold up his hand;\" and they all held them up.\r\n34. Xenophon then, rising again, said, \"Hear, soldiers, what appears to\r\nme to be necessary in addition to what I have laid before you. It is\r\nplain that we must march to some place from which we may get provisions;\r\nand I hear that there are some good-looking villages not more than\r\ntwenty stadia distant; 35. but I should not wonder if the enemy, (like\r\ncowardly dogs that run after such as pass by them, and bite them if they\r\ncan, but flee from those who pursue them,) I should not wonder, I say,\r\nif the enemy were to follow close upon us when we begin to march. 36. It\r\nwill, perhaps, be the safer way for us to march, therefore, forming a\r\nhollow square of the heavy-armed troops, in order that the baggage and\r\nthe large number of camp-followers, may be in greater security within\r\nit; and if it be now settled who is to lead the square, and regulate\r\nthe movements in front, who are to be on each flank, and who to have\r\ncharge of the rear, we shall not have to consider of these things when\r\nthe enemy approach, but may at once act according to what has been\r\narranged. 37. If, then, any one else sees anything better to recommend,\r\nlet it be settled otherwise; if not, let Cheirisophus lead, since he is\r\nalso a Lacedæmonian;[137] let two of the oldest generals take the\r\ncommand on each of the flanks; and let Timasion and myself, the youngest\r\nof the officers, take charge, at least for the present, of the rear. 38.\r\nAfter a time, when we have tried this arrangement, we will consider, as\r\noccasion may require, what may seem best to be done. If any one thinks\r\nof any better plan than this, let him speak.\" As nobody made any\r\nobjection, he said, \"Whosoever likes these proposals, let him hold up\r\nhis hand.\" The proposals were approved. 39. \"And now,\" he added, \"it\r\nbelongs to you to go and carry into execution what has been decided\r\nupon; and whosoever of you wishes to see his friends and relations, let\r\nhim prove himself a man of valour, for by no other means can he succeed\r\nin attaining that object; whoever of you desires to preserve his life,\r\nlet him strive to conquer, for it is the part of conquerors to kill, but\r\nof the conquered to die; and if any one of you covets spoil, let him\r\nendeavour to secure victory for us, for it is the privilege of victors\r\nat once to save their own property and to seize on that of the\r\nvanquished.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Τών καλλίστων ἐαυτὸν ἀξιώσαντα.] \"Thinking himself worthy\r\nof the most beautiful (equipments).\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: Τὸν θεόν.] Jupiter the Preserver. _Kühner_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Αὔθις ἀφανιούντων.] Weiske, Schneider, and others omit\r\nthe αὔθις.

Dindorf also gave the preference to it in his\r\nfirst edition, but has subsequently adopted the other reading. Μήτε\r\nδιοίσουσιν is interpreted by Bornemann, \"if the rivers shall present no\r\ndifference in any part of their course; if they be as broad at their\r\nsources as at their mouths.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: Αὐτοὶ εἴδομεν.] The Greeks had passed through a part of\r\nLycaonia in their march up the country, i. 2. 19; when, however, it is\r\nnot indicated that they saw much.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: The allusion is to Odyss. ix. 83, where the lotus-eaters\r\nare mentioned:\r\n\r\n    The trees around them all their food produce,\r\n    Lotus the name, divine nectareous juice,\r\n    (Thence called Lotophagi,) which whoso tastes,\r\n    Insatiate riots in the sweet repasts,\r\n    Nor other home, nor other care intends,\r\n    But quits his house, his country, and his friends. _Pope._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: Περαίνειν.] Sc. τὸν λόγον.

The Lacedæmonians were then at the head of\r\nGreece: comp. v. 9. 26; vi. 6. 12. _Zeune_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     The Greeks are visited by Mithridates as a friend, but he soon\r\n     shows that he is an enemy, and they resolve to enter into no\r\n     further negotiations with the Persian king. They pass the Zabatus,\r\n     are harassed by Mithridates, and suffer from the want of slingers\r\n     and cavalry. Volunteers are enrolled for these services.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. When this speech was concluded, they rose up, and went off to burn\r\ntheir carriages and tents; of their superfluous baggage they divided\r\namong themselves such portions as any needed, and threw the rest into\r\nthe fire. Having done this, they went to breakfast. While they were at\r\ntheir meal, Mithridates rode up to them with about thirty horsemen and\r\nrequesting the generals to come within hearing, spoke as follows: 2. \"I\r\nwas faithful to Cyrus, O men of Greece, as you yourselves know; I am now\r\nwell disposed towards you; and I am living here under great\r\napprehensions; if therefore I should find that you are concerting any\r\nsafe scheme for your deliverance, I would come and join you, bringing\r\nwith me all my followers. Let me know, therefore, what you have in\r\ncontemplation, as one who is your friend and well-wisher, and who is\r\nwilling to march along with you.\" 3. The generals, after consulting\r\ntogether, resolved on returning the following answer; and Cheirisophus\r\ndelivered it: \"It is our determination, if no one hinders us from\r\nreturning home, to proceed through the country with as little injury to\r\nit as possible; but if any one opposes us on our march, to fight our way\r\nagainst him as vigorously as we can.\" 4. Mithridates then endeavoured to\r\nconvince them how impracticable it was to escape without the king's\r\nconsent. But it was now concluded that he was insidiously sent; for one\r\nof the followers of Tissaphernes was in attendance on him to insure his\r\nfidelity.[138] 5. In consequence, it was thought right by the generals\r\nto pass a resolution that the war should be such as to admit of no\r\nintercourse by heralds;[139] for those that came tried to corrupt the\r\nsoldiers, and succeeded in seducing one of the captains, Nicarchus an\r\nArcadian, and he deserted in the night with about twenty men.\r\n\r\n6. Having then dined, and crossed the river Zabatus, they marched on in\r\nregular order, keeping the baggage-cattle and camp-followers in the\r\ncentre. But before they had gone far, Mithridates made his appearance\r\nagain with about two hundred cavalry and about four hundred archers and\r\nslingers, very light and active troops. 7. He advanced towards the\r\nGreeks as a friend, but, when he came near, some of his men, both horse\r\nand foot, suddenly discharged their arrows, and others used their\r\nslings, and wounded some of our men. The rear of the Greeks indeed was\r\nmuch harassed, and could do nothing in return; for the Cretan bowmen\r\nshot to a less distance than the Persians, and had also, as being\r\nlightly armed, sheltered themselves within the heavy troops; and the\r\njavelin-men did not hurl far enough to reach the slingers. 8. Upon this\r\nit seemed to Xenophon that it would be well to pursue them; and such of\r\nthe heavy-armed and peltasts as happened to be with him in the rear,\r\nbegan to pursue, but could overtake in the pursuit not a single man of\r\nthe enemy; 9. for the Greeks had no cavalry,[140] nor could their\r\ninfantry, in a short distance, overtake the infantry of the enemy, who\r\ntook to flight when they were a long way off, since it was impossible\r\nfor the Greeks to follow them to a great distance from the rest of the\r\narmy. 10. The Barbarian cavalry, too, inflicted wounds in their retreat,\r\nshooting backwards as they rode, and however far the Greeks advanced in\r\npursuit, so far were they obliged to retreat fighting. 11. Thus during\r\nthe whole day they did not advance more than five-and-twenty stadia;\r\nhowever, they arrived at the villages in the evening.\r\n\r\nHere again there was much dejection; and Cheirisophus and the oldest of\r\nthe generals blamed Xenophon for pursuing the enemy apart from the main\r\nbody, endangering himself, and yet being unable to hurt the assailants.\r\n12. Xenophon, hearing this charge, acknowledged that they blamed him\r\njustly, and that the result bore testimony in their favour. \"But,\" said\r\nhe, \"I was under the necessity of pursuing, as I saw that we suffered\r\ngreat damage while remaining at our posts, and were unable to retaliate.\r\n13. But when we began to pursue,\" continued he, \"the truth was as you\r\nsay; for we were none the better able to injure the enemy, and we could\r\nnot retreat without great difficulty. 14. Thanks are due to the gods,\r\ntherefore, that the Barbarians did not come upon us in great force, but\r\nonly with a few troops, so that, whilst they did us no great harm, they\r\nshowed us of what we stand in need: 15. for at present the enemy shoot\r\ntheir arrows and sling their stones such a distance, that neither can\r\nthe Cretans return their shots, nor can those who throw with the hand\r\nreach them; and when we pursue them, we cannot go after them any great\r\ndistance from the main body, and in a short space a foot-soldier, even\r\nif ever so swift, cannot overtake another foot-soldier, starting at\r\nbow-shot distance. 16. If therefore we would keep off the enemy, so that\r\nthey may be unable to hurt us on our march, we must at once provide\r\nourselves with slingers and cavalry. There are, I hear, some Rhodians in\r\nour army, the greater number of whom, they say, understand the use of\r\nthe sling, while their weapon carries even double the distance of the\r\nPersian sling, 17. which, as they sling with large stones, reach only a\r\nshort distance, while the Rhodians know how to use leaden bullets. 18.\r\nIf then, we ascertain which of them have slings, and give money to each\r\nof them[141] for them; and pay money also to any one who is willing to\r\nplait more, and find some other privilege[142] for him who consents to\r\nserve in the troop of slingers,[143] possibly some will offer themselves\r\nwho may be able to be of service to us. 19. I see also that there are\r\nhorses in the army, some in my possession, and some left by Clearchus,\r\nbesides many others taken from the enemy which are employed in carrying\r\nthe baggage. If, then, we collect all these, and put ordinary\r\nbaggage-cattle in their place, and equip the horses for riders, they\r\nwill perhaps annoy the enemy in their flight.\" 20. These suggestions\r\nwere approved; and that very night there came forward slingers to the\r\nnumber of two hundred. The next day, as many as fifty horsemen and\r\nhorses were pronounced fit for service; leathern jackets[144] and\r\nbreastplates were furnished to them; and Lycius the son of Polystratus\r\nan Athenian, was appointed their captain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Πίστεως ἕνεκα.] To watch him, lest he should act\r\ntreacherously. _Kühner_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: Πόλεμον ἀκήρυκτον.] Properly _war in which there is no\r\nuse for heralds_, but in which all is violent and desperate; so that\r\nἀκήρυκτος will be equivalent, according to Hesychius, to ἀδιάλλακτος,\r\n_implacable_, _irreconcilable_.

Hesychius has σπολὰς, χιτωνίσκος βαθὺς, σκύτινος, ὁ\r\nβύρσινος θώραξ. See Pollux, 7. 70; 10. 143. Suidas, Phavorinus, and\r\nPhotius give similar interpretations.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n     Mithridates again pursues the Greeks, but is repulsed. They reach\r\n     the Tigris, encamp at Mespila, and are attacked by Tissaphernes\r\n     with a numerous force. They repel him, and alter their order of\r\n     march. Traversing a mountainous part of the country, they are\r\n     harassed by the enemy, till, on getting possession of a height,\r\n     they are enabled to reach the plain beyond it in safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Having halted for that day, they went forward on the next, rising\r\nearlier in the morning than usual; for they had a ravine formed by a\r\ntorrent to pass, at which they were afraid that the enemy would attack\r\nthem while they were crossing. 2. It was not till they had got over,\r\nhowever, that Mithridates again made his appearance, having now with him\r\na thousand horse, and archers and slingers to the number of four\r\nthousand; for he had solicited and obtained that number from\r\nTissaphernes, promising that, if he received them, he would deliver the\r\nGreeks into his hands; for he had conceived a contempt for them,\r\nbecause, in his previous attack on them, though he had but a small force\r\nwith him, he had suffered no loss, and thought that he had caused them\r\ngreat annoyance. 3. When the Greeks, having crossed, were distant about\r\neight stadia from the ravine, Mithridates also passed over it with his\r\nforce. Instructions had been issued to such of the peltasts and\r\nheavy-armed troops as were to pursue, and a charge had been given to the\r\nhorsemen to pursue with boldness, as a sufficient force would follow to\r\nsupport them. 4. When therefore Mithridates overtook them, and the\r\nslings and arrows began to take effect, a signal was given to the Greeks\r\nwith the trumpet, and those who had been ordered immediately hastened to\r\ncharge the enemy, the cavalry riding forward at the same time. The enemy\r\nhowever did not wait to receive their charge, but fled back to the\r\nravine. 5. In the pursuit several of the Barbarian foot were killed,\r\nand about eighteen of the horse were made prisoners in the defile. The\r\nGreeks, of their own impulse, mutilated the dead bodies, in order that\r\nthe sight of them might be as horrible as possible to the enemy.\r\n\r\n6. The enemy, after faring thus, went off, and the Greeks, advancing the\r\nrest of the day without molestation, arrived at the river Tigris. 7.\r\nHere was a large deserted city, the name of which was Larissa, and which\r\nthe Medes had formerly inhabited. The breadth of its wall was five and\r\ntwenty feet, and the height of it a hundred; its circuit was two\r\nparasangs. It was built of bricks made of clay, but there was under it a\r\nstone foundation,[145] the height of twenty feet. 8. This city the king\r\nof the Persians,[146] at the time when the Persians wrested[147] the\r\nempire from the Medes, was unable by any means to take; a cloud,\r\nhowever, having covered the sun, hid it from view,[148] till the people\r\ndeserted it,[149] and so it was taken. 9. Near the city was a stone\r\npyramid of the breadth[150] of one plethrum, and the height of two\r\nplethra. Upon it[151] were many of the Barbarians who had fled from the\r\nneighbouring villages.\r\n\r\n10. Hence they proceeded one day's journey, six parasangs, to a large\r\nunoccupied fortress,[152] situated near a city, the name of which was\r\nMespila; the Medes had formerly inhabited it. The foundation of the wall\r\nwas of polished stone, full of shells,[153] the breadth fifty feet, and\r\nthe height fifty; 11. and on it was constructed a wall of bricks, fifty\r\nfeet broad, and a hundred high; the circumference of it was six\r\nparasangs. Here Medea, the king's wife, is said to have taken refuge,\r\nwhen the Medes were deprived of their empire by the Persians. 12. The\r\nking of the Persians, on besieging this city, was unable to reduce it\r\neither by length of time or by assault, but Jupiter, as with a\r\nthunder-stroke,[154] deprived the inhabitants of their senses, and thus\r\nit was taken.\r\n\r\n13. Hence they proceeded one day's journey, a distance of four\r\nparasangs. In the course of this day's march Tissaphernes made his\r\nappearance, having with him the cavalry which he himself commanded, the\r\nforce of Orontes, who had married the king's daughter, the Barbarian\r\ntroops with which Cyrus went up, the troops with which the king's\r\nbrother came to assist him, and, besides these, all that the king\r\nhimself had given him; so that his army appeared extremely numerous. 14.\r\nWhen he came near, he stationed some of his companies in the rear, and\r\nbrought others round upon our flanks, but did not venture to make a\r\ncharge, or show any disposition to endanger himself, but ordered his men\r\nto use their slings and bows. 15. But when the Rhodians, who were\r\ndispersed among the ranks, began to use their slings, and the Scythian\r\narchers[155] discharged their arrows, no one failing to hit a man, (for\r\nit would not have been easy to do so, even if they had been ever so\r\ndesirous,) Tissaphernes hastily retreated beyond reach of the missiles,\r\nand the other divisions drew off at the same time. 16. During the rest\r\nof the day the Greeks continued their march, and the enemy followed; but\r\nthe Barbarians no longer harassed them with their usual skirmishing; for\r\nthe Rhodians sent their missiles to a greater distance than the\r\nPersians, and than most of the bowmen. 17. The bows of the Persians,\r\ntoo, were large, so that such of their arrows as were taken up, were of\r\nservice to the Cretans, who continued to use the enemy's arrows, and\r\npractised shooting by sending them far up into the air.[156] A great\r\nnumber of bowstrings were also found in the villages, and some lead, so\r\nthat they could use it for their slings.\r\n\r\n18. For that day, therefore, as soon as the Greeks reached the villages\r\nand encamped, the Barbarians went off, having had the worst in the\r\nskirmish; and during the next the Greeks remained where they were, and\r\ncollected provisions, for there was plenty of corn in the villages. The\r\nday after, they proceeded through the open country, and Tissaphernes\r\nfollowed, hurling missiles at them from a distance. 19. Here the Greeks\r\nfound that a square was a bad disposition for an army when the enemy\r\nwas behind them: for it must necessarily happen, that if the flanks of\r\nthe square close together from the road being narrow, or from hills or a\r\nbridge making it necessary, that the heavy-armed men must be pushed out\r\nof their places, and march with difficulty,[157] being at the same time\r\ncrowded together and thrown into confusion; so that when in such\r\ndisorder they must be nearly useless. 20. And when, again, the flanks\r\ndivide, those who were previously forced out of their places, must now\r\nof necessity separate, and the space between the flanks be left empty;\r\nand men who are thrown into such a condition must doubtless lose heart,\r\nif the enemy are behind them. Whenever, too, they had to pass a bridge,\r\nor any other crossing-place, each hastened on to get first, and the\r\nenemy had then a fine opportunity of attacking them.[158] 21. The\r\ngenerals, seeing that such was the case, formed six companies of a\r\nhundred men each, and appointed captains of these companies, as well as\r\ncaptains of fifty and captains of twenty-five.[159] These captains and\r\ntheir companies, on the march, whenever the flanks of the square closed\r\ntogether, fell behind, so as to cause no disorder in the flanks, and\r\nthen led on outside the flanks; 22. and whenever the sides of the square\r\nopened, they filled up the centre, if the opening was narrow, by\r\ncompanies; if rather wide, by fifties; if very wide, by\r\ntwenty-fives;[160] so that the centre was always full. 23. If, then, it\r\nwas necessary to pass any defile or bridge, they were not thrown into\r\nconfusion, but the captains and companies went over in succession;[161]\r\nand if anything was needed in any part of the main body, these were at\r\nhand. In this order they advanced four days' journey.\r\n\r\n24. As they were pursuing the fifth day's march, they observed a kind of\r\npalace, and several villages round it. The way to this place, they\r\nperceived, lay among high hills, which reached down from a mountain, at\r\nthe foot of which the village was.[162] These hills the Greeks were glad\r\nto see, as was natural, when the enemy's force consisted of cavalry. 25.\r\nBut when, after leaving the plain, they had ascended the first hill, and\r\nwere descending in order to mount the second, the Barbarians came upon\r\nthem, and from the eminence began, under the lash,[163] to hurl darts,\r\nuse their slings, and shoot arrows, on the ground below; 26. they\r\nwounded many, and had the advantage over the light-armed Greeks, and\r\nshut them up within the heavy-armed; so that both the slingers and\r\narchers were that day entirely useless, being mixed with the crowd that\r\nhad charge of the baggage. 27. When the Greeks, on being hard pressed,\r\nattempted pursuit, they mounted the height but slowly, as being heavily\r\narmed, while the enemy sprang up speedily. 28. When, again, they\r\nretreated back to the rest of the force, they fared equally ill. The\r\nsame occurrences took place on the second hill; so that they thought it\r\nproper not to move the soldiers from the third hill, until they led up a\r\nbody of peltasts to the mountain from the right wing of the square. 29.\r\nWhen these had got above the pursuing enemy, they no longer attacked\r\nthem in their descent, fearing that they might be cut off from their own\r\nbody, and that enemies might assail them on both sides. 30. Marching in\r\nthis manner for the rest of the day, some by the route among the hills,\r\nand others advancing abreast of them along the mountain, they arrived\r\nat the villages, and appointed eight surgeons,[164] for there were many\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n31. Here they remained three days, both for the sake of the wounded, and\r\nbecause they found, at the same time, abundance of provisions,\r\nwheat-flour, wine, and a great quantity of barley laid up for horses;\r\nsupplies which had been collected for the satrap of the country. On the\r\nfourth day they went down into the plain. 32. But as Tissaphernes\r\novertook them with his forces, necessity taught them to encamp where\r\nthey first saw a village, and not to march on still fighting; for there\r\nwere many unfitted for action, some wounded, some carrying the wounded,\r\nand some bearing the arms of those that carried them. 33. When however\r\nthey were encamped, and the Barbarians, coming up to the village,\r\nattempted to skirmish with them, the Greeks had greatly the advantage;\r\nfor they found a great difference[165] between sallying from their own\r\nground to repulse the enemy, and fighting with a pursuing enemy on their\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\n34. When evening approached, it became time for the enemy to retire; for\r\nthe Barbarians never encamped at a less distance from the Greeks than\r\nsixty stadia, fearing lest the Greeks should attack them in the night.\r\n35. For in the night a Persian army is difficult to manage; as their\r\nhorses are tied, and for the most part fastened by the feet, that they\r\nmay not run away if they should be untied; and if any sudden attack\r\ntakes place, the Persian has[166] to put the housings [167] on his\r\nhorse, and to bridle him, and then, when he has put on his armour, to\r\nmount; but all these things are troublesome by night and in the midst of\r\nan alarm. On this account they encamped at a distance from the Greeks.\r\n\r\n36. As soon as the Greeks saw that they intended to retire, and were\r\npassing the order for doing so, proclamation was made among the Greeks,\r\nin the hearing of the enemy, that they were to collect their baggage;\r\nwhen the Barbarians, for some time, delayed their march; but, when it\r\ngrew late, they went off; for they did not think it expedient to march\r\nand arrive at their camp[168] in the night. 37. When the Greeks observed\r\nthem evidently moving away, they themselves also decamped[169] and began\r\nto march, and accomplished as much as sixty stadia. There was thus so\r\ngreat a distance between the armies, that the enemy did not appear on\r\nthe following day or on the third; but on the fourth, the Barbarians,\r\nhaving gone forward in the night, occupied an elevated position on the\r\nright, on the route by which the Greeks were to pass; the brow of a\r\nmountain, beneath which was the descent into the plain. 38. As soon as\r\nCheirisophus saw that this eminence was pre-occupied, he sent for\r\nXenophon from the rear, and ordered him to bring his peltasts and come\r\nto the front. 39. Xenophon however did not bring the peltasts, (for he\r\nsaw Tissaphernes, and all his force, in full view,) but, riding up\r\nalone, asked, \"Why do you call me?\" Cheirisophus replied, \"You may see;\r\nfor the eminence above the descent has been pre-occupied against us, and\r\nit is impossible to pass, unless we cut off those who are on it. But why\r\ndid you not bring the peltasts?\" 40. Xenophon replied that he did not\r\nthink it right to leave the rear unguarded when the enemy were in sight.\r\n\"But it is high time,\" he continued, \"to consider how some of us may\r\ndislodge those men from the hill.\" 41. Xenophon now noticed that the\r\nsummit of the mountain[170] was above their own army, and that there\r\nwas a way from it to the hill where the enemy were, and exclaimed, \"It\r\nis best for us, Cheirisophus, to hasten as quickly as possible to the\r\nsummit, for if we gain this, those who are above our road will be unable\r\nto maintain their ground. But do you, if you please, remain with the\r\narmy; I have a desire to go forward; or, if you prefer it, proceed on to\r\nthe mountain, and I will stay here.\" 42. \"I leave you,\" replied\r\nCheirisophus, \"to choose which of the two you please.\" Xenophon,\r\nobserving that he was the younger, decided on advancing, but requested\r\nCheirisophus to send with him a detachment from the front, as it was too\r\ngreat a distance to bring one from the rear. 43. Cheirisophus then sent\r\nwith him the peltasts from the front; and he took those that were in the\r\nmiddle of the square. Cheirisophus also ordered the three hundred that\r\nhe had with him at the head of the square, consisting of picked men, to\r\nfollow Xenophon.\r\n\r\n44. The party then marched forward with all possible speed. But the\r\nenemy on the heights, when they perceived that the Greeks were directing\r\ntheir course towards the summit, hurried forward also themselves to\r\ncontend for the possession of the summit. 45. There was then great\r\nshouting from the Grecian army, cheering their men, and great shouting\r\nalso from the troops of Tissaphernes, cheering on theirs. 46. Xenophon,\r\nriding along on horseback, encouraged his party, saying, \"Consider,\r\nsoldiers, that you are now contending for Greece; that after a brief\r\nstruggle now, we shall march the rest of the way without fighting, to\r\njoin our children and our wives.\" 47. Soterides, a Sicyonian, cried out,\r\n\"We are not upon an equality, Xenophon; for you are carried on a horse,\r\nwhile I have hard work to carry my shield.\" 48. Xenophon, on hearing\r\nthis remark, leaped from his horse, pushed Soterides from the ranks,\r\ntook from him his shield, and marched on with it as fast as he was able.\r\nHe happened however to have on his horseman's corslet, so that he was\r\ndistressed. Yet he continued to exhort the men in front to lead on\r\ngently, and those behind, who followed with difficulty, to come up. 49.\r\nBut the rest of the soldiers beat and threw stones at Soterides, and\r\nreviled him, till they obliged him to resume his shield and march in his\r\nplace. Xenophon, remounting, led the way, as long as it was passable for\r\nhis horse, on horseback, but when it became impassable, he left his\r\nhorse behind, and hastened forward on foot. Thus they got the start of\r\nthe enemy, and arrived first at the summit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: Κρηπὶς δ' ὑπῆν λιθίνη, κ. τ. λ.] The foundation appears\r\nto have risen twenty feet above the ground; so that the whole height of\r\nthe wall would be a hundred and twenty feet. Mr. Ainsworth says that he\r\nfound the ruins of the brick wall at Resen, which he considers to be the\r\nsame with Larissa, \"based on a rude and hard conglomerate rock, giving\r\nto them all the solidity and characteristics of being built of stone.\"\r\n_Travels in the Track_, p. 139.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: Cyrus the Great.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: Ἐλάμβανον.] That the Medes did not willingly submit, but\r\nwere overcome by force, is testified by Herodotus, and is apparent from\r\nwhat is said here; whence it follows that λαμβάνειν τὴν ἀρχὴν παρά τινος\r\nmay be applied even when those who lose the government are forcibly\r\ndeprived of it. Xenophon however is at variance with himself in the\r\nCyropædia, where Cyrus is said to have succeeded to the throne by a\r\nmarriage with the daughter of Cyaxares. _Kühner_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: Ἥλιον δὲ νεφέλη προκαλύψασα ἠφάνισε.] This reading has\r\nbeen adopted by Dindorf and others, from a conjecture of Brodæus or\r\nMuretus; the manuscripts have all ἥλιος δὲ νεφέλην προκάλυψας, except\r\ntwo, one of which has the ν erased in νεφέλην, and the other νεφέλῃ.\r\nThose who read with Dindorf refer to Plutarch de Placit. Philosoph. ii.\r\n24, where the cause of an eclipse of the sun is said by some\r\nphilosophers to be _a condensation of clouds imperceptibly advancing\r\nover the disc_. Bornemann and Kühner restore the reading of the\r\nmanuscripts, which Langius thus interprets: _sol nubem sibi prætendens\r\nse obscuravit_; than which no better explanation has been offered. That\r\nwe are not to suppose an eclipse of the sun to be signified in the text,\r\nis well observed by Bornemann; as Thales had previously ascertained the\r\ncauses of such eclipses, and had foretold one, according to Herodotus i.\r\n74; hence it is impossible to believe that Xenophon would have spoken of\r\na solar eclipse himself, or have made the inhabitants speak of one, so\r\nirrationally. Hutchinson and Zeune absurdly understand τὴν πόλιν with\r\nἠφάνισε.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: Ἐξέλιπον.] Hutchinson and Weiske interpret this word\r\n_animis defecerunt_. Abreschius (Dilucid.

Bornemann, if the article be added, thinks that _the village\r\nin which the palace stood_ is intended. The passage seems to me\r\ndecidedly better without the article; for, if it be inserted, the reader\r\nis puzzled to know why Xenophon changes the number, when he had just\r\nbefore said that the palace stood in the midst of villages.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: According to the discipline of the Persians; see Herod,\r\nvii. 21, 56, 223.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: This is the first mention of surgeons in the Greek army,\r\nas Mr. Stanford observes, since the time of Homer.

Comp. sect. 37. _Kühner_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     The Greeks arrive at a point where the Carduchian mountains\r\n     overhang the river, and, as they are still harassed by the enemy,\r\n     the generals hold a consultation, and determine to march across the\r\n     mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Barbarians, in consequence, turned their backs and fled every one\r\nas he could, and the Greeks took possession of the top of the hill.\r\nTissaphernes and Ariæus turned aside, and went off in another direction.\r\nCheirisophus and his forces, going down into the plain, encamped in a\r\nvillage abounding with acceptable supplies; and there were also in this\r\nplain many other villages stored with excellent provisions, lying along\r\nthe river Tigris. 2. When it was evening, the enemy suddenly showed\r\nthemselves in the plain, and cut off some of the Greeks who were\r\ndispersed over the ground foraging; for several herds of cattle had been\r\nintercepted as they were being transported to the other side of the\r\nriver. 3. Here Tissaphernes and his party attempted to set fire to the\r\nvillages, and some of the Greeks were much disheartened, being\r\napprehensive that, if they should burn them, they would have no place\r\nwhence to procure supplies.\r\n\r\n4. Cheirisophus and his men now returned from giving succour;[171] and\r\nXenophon, when he came down, riding past the ranks, as the Greeks,\r\ncoming in from affording aid, met him, said, 5. \"You see, Greeks, that\r\nthe enemy admit that the country is now ours, for whereas they\r\nstipulated, when they made the truce, that we should not burn the king's\r\ncountry, they now burn it themselves, as being no longer theirs. But\r\nwherever they leave supplies for themselves, thither also they shall see\r\nus direct our march. 6. I think, however, Cheirisophus,\" continued he,\r\n\"that we ought to resist these burners, as if in defence of our own\r\nterritory.\" \"I,\" replied Cheirisophus, \"am of a different opinion;\r\nrather let us burn also,\" said he, \"and thus they will the sooner\r\ncease.\"\r\n\r\n7. When they returned to their quarters,[172] the soldiers busied\r\nthemselves about their provisions, but the generals and captains held a\r\ncouncil. There was now much perplexity; for on one side of them were\r\nexceeding high mountains, and on the other a river of such depth, that,\r\nwhen they sounded it, their spears did not rise above the water. 8.\r\nWhile they were in doubt how to act, a Rhodian came to them, and said,\r\n\"I am willing to convey you across, O Greeks, by four thousand\r\nheavy-armed men at a time, if you will furnish me with what I require\r\nfor the purpose, and give me a talent as a remuneration.\" 9. Being asked\r\nwhat he should require, he replied, \"I shall want two thousand hides\r\nmade into bags; and I see here many sheep, goats, oxen, and asses, the\r\nhides of which, being blown out,[173] would easily furnish the means of\r\ncrossing. 10. I shall want also the ropes which you use for the\r\nbaggage-cattle; joining, with these, the bags to one another, steadying\r\neach bag by attaching stones to it, letting the stones down like anchors\r\ninto the water, extending the bags across the stream, and securing them\r\nto both banks, I will then lay wood upon them, and strew earth over the\r\nwood. 11. That you will not sink, you will at once see; for each skin\r\nwill prevent two men from sinking, and the wood and earth will keep them\r\nfrom slipping off.\" 12. The generals, on hearing this proposal, thought\r\nthe invention ingenious, but the execution of it impossible, for there\r\nwere numerous cavalry on the other side to hinder their passage, who, at\r\nthe commencement, would not have allowed the first that made the attempt\r\nto effect their purposes.\r\n\r\n13. The next day they retreated back towards Babylon, to some unburnt\r\nvillages, having first set fire to those which they abandoned; so that\r\nthe enemy did not come up to them, but watched them, and seemed to be\r\nwondering which way the Greeks would turn themselves, and what they had\r\nin their mind. 14. The rest of the soldiers then turned their thoughts\r\nto getting supplies; but the generals and captains held another council,\r\nand, bringing together the prisoners, questioned them as to the whole\r\ncountry around, what each part was. 15. They said that the parts toward\r\nthe south were on the road towards Babylon and Media, through which the\r\nGreeks had come; that the road towards the east led to Susa and\r\nEcbatana, where the king was said to pass the summer and spring; that\r\nthe one across[174] the river, towards the west, led to Lydia and Ionia;\r\nand that the other over the mountains, towards the north, led to the\r\nCarduchi. 16. This people, they said, lived among the mountains, were\r\nvery warlike, and did not obey the king; that on one occasion, a royal\r\narmy of a hundred and twenty thousand men had penetrated into their\r\ncountry, whence, from the impracticability of the ground, not one of\r\nthem returned; but that, whenever they made a treaty with the satrap of\r\nthe plain, some of them had intercourse with the Carduchi, and some of\r\nthe Carduchi with them. 17. The generals, having heard these statements,\r\nkept apart by themselves those who said that they knew the road in each\r\ndirection, not letting it be known which way they intended to go. It\r\nappeared necessary to the generals, however, to make their way over the\r\nmountains into the country of the Carduchi; for the prisoners said that\r\nafter passing through this they would come to Armenia, a large and rich\r\ncountry, of which Orontes was governor, whence it would be easy for them\r\nto go whichever way they pleased.\r\n\r\n18. With reference to this proceeding, they made a sacrifice, in order\r\nthat, when it should seem time, they might commence their march; for\r\nthey were afraid that the passage over the mountains might be\r\npre-occupied by the enemy; and they gave orders, that when the soldiers\r\nhad supped, they should all pack up their baggage and go to rest, and\r\nfollow their leaders whenever the signal should be given.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: Ἐκ τῆς βοηθείας.] Xenophon is here somewhat obscure; for\r\nhe made no mention of this βοηθεία before. Cheirisophus and his men seem\r\nto have gone to aid the party of Greeks that were dispersed for plunder,\r\nwhen some of them were cut off by the Persians, and when Tissaphernes\r\nattempted to burn the villages. * * * Afterwards he is rather\r\ntautological; for the words ἡνίκα ----οἱ Ἕλληνες express no more than is\r\nsaid in οἱ μὲν ἀμφὶ Χειρίσοφον ---- βοηθείας, except that they serve to\r\nmark the exact time when Xenophon addressed the men. _Kühner_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: Ἐπὶ τὰς σκηνάς.] The tents were burned, iii. 3. 1; and\r\nKrüger therefore observes that we must consider τὰς σκηνάς as equivalent\r\nto τὸ στρατόπεδον, or the place of encampment. This explanation is\r\nbetter than that of Weiske and Zeune, who think that the _shelter of the\r\nvillages_ is meant.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: Ἅ ἀποδαρέντα καὶ φυσηθέντα.] \"Which being skinned and\r\nblown out.\" From brevity, Xenophon has said that of the animals which he\r\nought to have said of their skins. _Krüger_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: Διαβάντι.] The road \"for one crossing\" the river.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n     The Greeks enter the territory of the Carduchi, where they suffer\r\n     greatly from the wind and cold, as well as from the Barbarians, who\r\n     harass them with frequent attacks on their march.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. What occurred in the expedition up the country to the time of the\r\nbattle, and what took place after the battle during the truce which the\r\nking and the Greeks that went up with Cyrus concluded, and what\r\nhostilities were committed against the Greeks after the king and\r\nTissaphernes had violated the truce, and while the Persian army was\r\npursuing them, have been related in the preceding part of the narrative.\r\n\r\n2. When they had arrived at a spot where the Tigris was quite impassable\r\nfrom its depth and width, and where there was no passage along, its\r\nbanks, as the Carduchian mountains hung steep over the stream, it\r\nappeared to the generals that they must march over those mountains, 3.\r\nfor they had heard from the prisoners that \"if they could but cross the\r\nCarduchian mountains, they would be able to ford, if they wished, the\r\nsources of the Tigris in Armenia, or, if they declined doing so, to make\r\na circuit round them.\" The sources of the Euphrates, too, they said were\r\nnot far from those of the Tigris; and such is the truth.[175]\r\n\r\n4. Their entrance upon the territory of the Carduchi they made in the\r\nfollowing manner, endeavouring at once to escape observation, and to\r\nanticipate the enemy in getting possession of the heights. 5. When it\r\nwas about the last watch, and enough of the night was left to allow them\r\nto cross the plain under cover of the darkness, they arose at a given\r\nsignal, and, marching onwards, reached the hills by break of day. 6.\r\nHere Cheirisophus took the lead of the army, having with him both his\r\nown men and all the light-armed; while Xenophon brought up the rear with\r\nthe heavy-armed troops, having not a single light-armed soldier; for\r\nthere seemed to be no danger that any of the enemy would attack them in\r\nthe rear as they were marching up the mountains. Cheirisophus indeed\r\nmounted the summit before any of the enemy perceived him; he then led\r\nslowly forward; 7. and each portion of the army, as it passed the summit\r\nin succession, followed him to the villages which lay in the windings\r\nand recesses of the mountains.[176] 8. The Carduchi, in consequence,\r\nquitting their dwellings, and taking with them their wives and children,\r\nfled to the hills. There was plenty of provisions left for the Greeks to\r\ntake; and the houses were furnished with great numbers of brazen\r\nutensils, none of which the Greeks took away. Nor did they pursue the\r\npeople, being inclined to spare them, if perchance the Carduchi, since\r\nthey were enemies to the king, might consent to allow them to pass\r\nthrough their country as that of friends; 9, the provisions, however, as\r\nmany as fell in their way, they carried off; for it was a matter of\r\nnecessity to do so. But as for the Carduchi themselves, they would\r\nneither listen when they called, nor did they give any other sign of\r\nfriendly feeling.\r\n\r\n10. But when the rear of the Greeks was descending from the hills into\r\nthe villages, being now overtaken by darkness, (for, as the way was\r\nnarrow, their ascent of the heights, and descent to the villages, had\r\nlasted the entire day,) some of the Carduchi, collecting together,\r\nattacked the hindmost, and killed and wounded some of them with stones\r\nand arrows. They were but few; for the Greek troops had come on them\r\nunawares; 11. but had they assembled in greater numbers, a great part of\r\nthe army would have been in danger of being destroyed. For this night,\r\naccordingly, they took up their abode in the villages; and the Carduchi\r\nlighted a number of fires around them on the hills, and observed the\r\npositions of one another.[177] 12. As soon as it was day, the generals\r\nand captains of the Greeks, meeting together, resolved, when they\r\nshould march, to reserve only such of the baggage-cattle as were most\r\nnecessary and most able, abandoning the rest, and to dismiss all the\r\nslaves in the army that had been recently captured; 13. for the cattle\r\nand the slaves, being numerous, rendered their progress slow, and the\r\nnumber of men in charge of them were unable to take part in any\r\nencounter; and besides, when the men were so numerous, it was necessary\r\nto procure and carry with them a double quantity of provisions. This\r\nresolution being passed, they made proclamation that the troops should\r\nact accordingly.\r\n\r\n14. When they had breakfasted, and were on the march, the generals,\r\ntaking their stand in a narrow part of the way, took from the soldiers\r\nwhatever of the things mentioned they found had not been left behind;\r\nand the men submitted to this, unless any of them, smitten with desire\r\nof a handsome boy or woman, conveyed them past secretly.[178] Thus they\r\nproceeded during this day, sometimes having to fight a little, and\r\nsometimes resting themselves. 15. On the next day a great storm arose;\r\nbut they were obliged to pursue their march, for they had not a\r\nsufficient supply of provisions. Cheirisophus continued to lead, and\r\nXenophon had charge of the rear. 16. The enemy pressed steadily upon\r\nthem, and, where the passes were narrow, came close up, and used their\r\nbows and their slings; so that the Greeks, sometimes pursuing and\r\nsometimes retreating, were compelled to march but slowly; and Xenophon,\r\nwhen the enemy attacked them violently, had frequently to pass the word\r\nfor a halt. 17. Cheirisophus, at other times, when the order was passed,\r\nhalted, but on one occasion he did not halt, but hurried on rapidly, and\r\npassed the word to follow; so that it was manifest that there was\r\nsomething extraordinary; but there was no time to go forward and\r\nascertain the cause of the haste; and the march of the rear-guard became\r\nlike a flight. 18. On this occasion a brave soldier, Cleonymus a\r\nLacedæmonian, met his death, being shot with an arrow in the side\r\nthrough his shield and corslet;[179] and also Basias, an Arcadian, shot\r\nright through the head.\r\n\r\n19. When they arrived at the place of encampment, Xenophon immediately\r\nproceeded, just as he was, to Cheirisophus, and blamed him for not\r\nhaving halted, as the men had been compelled to flee and fight at the\r\nsame time. \"Two honourable and brave soldiers,\" said he, \"have now been\r\nkilled, and we have been unable either to carry off their bodies or bury\r\nthem.\" 20. To this remark Cheirisophus answered, \"Cast your eyes upon\r\nthose mountains, and observe how impassable they all are. The only road\r\nwhich you see is steep; and close upon it you may perceive a great\r\nmultitude of men, who, having occupied the pass, keep guard at it. 21.\r\nFor these reasons I hastened on, and therefore did not wait for you, to\r\ntry if I could get the start of the enemy before the pass was seized;\r\nand the guides whom we have say that there is no other road.\" 22.\r\nXenophon rejoined, \"I have two prisoners; for when the enemy molested\r\nus, we placed an ambush, which enabled us to recover breath, and killed\r\nsome of them; and we were also anxious to take some alive for this very\r\npurpose, that we might use them, as being well acquainted with the\r\ncountry, for guides.\"\r\n\r\n23. Immediately after, bringing forward the two men, they inquired of\r\nthem separately whether they knew of any other road than that which was\r\nopen to their view. The one denied that he knew of any other, though\r\nmany threats were held out to him; and as he would give no useful\r\ninformation, he was put to death in sight of the other. 24. The survivor\r\nsaid that the other had denied any knowledge of a road, because he had a\r\ndaughter there married to somebody, but stated that he himself would\r\nlead them by a road that might be passed even by beasts of burden. 25.\r\nBeing then asked if there was any spot in it difficult to be passed, he\r\nreplied that there was one height, and that unless a party secured it\r\nbefore-hand, it would be impossible for them to pass. 26. Upon this it\r\nwas thought proper to call together the captains, both of the peltasts\r\nand of the heavy-armed men,[180] and to acquaint them with the prospect\r\nof affairs, and ask whether any of them was willing to prove himself a\r\nman of valour, and engage to go on this service as a volunteer. 27. Of\r\nthe heavy-armed, Aristonymus of Methydrium, and Agasias of Stymphalus,\r\nboth Arcadians, offered themselves; and Callimachus of Parrhasia, also\r\nan Arcadian, disputed the honour with them, and said that he himself was\r\neager to go, taking with him volunteers from the whole army; \"for I am\r\nsure,\" said he, \"that, many of the young men will follow if I take the\r\nlead.\" 28. They then asked if any of the officers of the light-armed\r\ntroops were willing to join in the attempt; and Aristeas of Chios\r\npresented himself, a man who had often proved himself of great value to\r\nthe army for similar services.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: Καὶ ἔστιν ὅυτως ἔχον.] A most happy emendation of\r\nAbreschius, Dilucid.

But they are still harassed, and\r\n     the rear suffers severely.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It was now afternoon, and the generals[181] desired the party to take\r\nsome refreshment and set forward. Having bound the guide, they put him\r\ninto their hands, and arranged with them, that, if they should gain the\r\nsummit, they should keep guard at that post during the night, and give a\r\nsignal by trumpet at break of day, and that those on the height should\r\nthen charge the enemy in possession of the apparent egress,[182] and\r\nthose below should issue forth and come in a body to their assistance as\r\nsoon as they were able.\r\n\r\n2. When they had made this arrangement, the party set out, being in\r\nnumber about two thousand; and there was heavy rain at the time.\r\nXenophon, taking the rear-guard, led them towards the apparent egress,\r\nin order that the enemy might turn their attention in that direction,\r\nand that those who were going round might as much as possible escape\r\nnotice. 3. But when the rear-guard came to a ravine, which they had to\r\npass to gain the ascent, the Barbarians then rolled down masses of\r\nrock,[183] each big enough to load a waggon, with other stones greater\r\nand smaller, which, striking in their descent against the rocks, were\r\nhurled abroad in all directions;[184] and it was utterly impossible even\r\nto approach the pass. 4. Some of the captains, when they could not\r\nsucceed in this part, made attempts in another, and continued their\r\nefforts till darkness came on. When they thought that they might retire\r\nunobserved, they went to get their supper; for the rear-guard had been\r\ndinnerless that day. The enemy, however, being evidently in fear,\r\ncontinued to roll down stones through the whole of the night, as it was\r\neasy to conjecture from the noise. 5. Those, meanwhile, who had the\r\nguide, taking a circuitous route, surprised a guard of the enemy sitting\r\nround a fire, and, having killed some of them, and put the rest to\r\nflight, remained on the spot, with the notion that they were in\r\npossession of the summit. 6. But in possession of it they were not; for\r\nthere was a small hill above them, round which lay the narrow pass, at\r\nwhich the guard had been posted. However, there was a way from thence to\r\nthat party of the enemy who were stationed at the open egress. 7. Here\r\nthey remained during the night.\r\n\r\nAs soon as day began to dawn, they advanced in regular order, and with\r\nsilence, against the enemy; and as there was a mist, they came close\r\nupon them before they were perceived. But when they caught sight of one\r\nanother, the trumpet sounded on the side of the Greeks, who, raising the\r\nshout of battle, rushed upon the enemy. The Barbarians did not stand\r\ntheir charge, but quitted the pass and fled; only a few of them were\r\nkilled, for they were active in moving off. 8. At the same time the\r\nparty of Cheirisophus, hearing the sound of the trumpet, marched\r\nimmediately up the plain track; while others of the officers proceeded\r\nby untrodden paths, where each happened to be, and, climbing up as well\r\nas they could, drew up one another with their spears; 9. and these were\r\nthe first to join those who had secured the position. Xenophon, with the\r\nhalf of the rear-guard, went up by the same way as those who had the\r\nguide; for it was the most practicable for the baggage-cattle; the other\r\nhalf he ordered to come up behind the cattle. 10. In their way they came\r\nto a hill overhanging the road, which was occupied by the enemy, whom\r\nthey must either dislodge or be separated from the rest of the Greeks.\r\nThe men themselves, indeed, might have gone the same way as the rest of\r\nthe army, but the baggage-cattle could ascend by no other route than\r\nthis. 11. Encouraging one another, therefore, they made an attack upon\r\nthe hill in files,[185] not on every side, but leaving a way of escape\r\nfor the enemy, if they should be inclined to flee. 12. For a while, as\r\nthey were making their way as each best could, the Barbarians shot\r\narrows and threw stones at them, but did not receive them in close\r\nencounter, and at last abandoned the place entirely.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks had no sooner passed the hill, than they caught sight of\r\nanother before them occupied also by the enemy. Upon this hill it was\r\nresolved likewise to make an assault. 13. But Xenophon, apprehending\r\nthat, if he left the hill which they had taken unguarded, the enemy,\r\nrecovering it, might attack the baggage-cattle as they were passing,\r\n(for the train of baggage-cattle reached a great distance, as they were\r\nmarching along a narrow path,) left upon the hill the captains\r\nCephisodorus the son of Cephisophon, an Athenian, Amphicrates the son of\r\nAmphidemus, an Athenian, and Archagoras, an exile from Argos, while he\r\nhimself, with the others, directed his march upon the second hill, which\r\nthey also captured in a similar manner. 14. However, there was still a\r\nthird hill left for them to take, which was by far the steepest of the\r\nwhole; this was an eminence that overhung the post where the guard was\r\nsurprised in the night by the volunteers. 15. But as the Greeks came up,\r\nthe Barbarians deserted the hill without attempting any defence, so that\r\nall were surprised, and suspected that they had left their position from\r\nfear of being surrounded and besieged in it. But the truth was, that\r\nhaving observed from the eminence what had passed behind, they all went\r\noff with the intention of attacking the rear.\r\n\r\n16. Xenophon, with the youngest of his men, ascended to the top, and\r\nordered the rest to march on slowly, so that the companies in the rear\r\nmight join them; and he directed them, after proceeding some distance,\r\nto halt under arms, on a level piece of ground. 17. At this juncture\r\nAristagoras the Argive came fleeing from the enemy, and said that the\r\nGreeks were driven from the first hill, and that Cephisodorus, and\r\nAmphicrates, and all the rest, who had not leaped from the rock, and\r\njoined the rear-guard, had been killed. 18. The Barbarians, after this\r\nsuccess, appeared upon an eminence opposite the third hill, and Xenophon\r\nbegan to treat with them, through an interpreter, about making a truce,\r\nand called upon them to give up the dead. 19. They replied, that they\r\nwould give them up on condition that he would not burn their villages.\r\nTo this Xenophon agreed. But while the rest of the army was passing on,\r\nand these were discussing the terms of a truce, all the Barbarians from\r\nthat part of the country had flocked together. Here the enemy made a\r\nstand; 20. and when Xenophon's party began to descend the hill, to join\r\nthe others where the heavy-armed troops were drawn up,[186] they came\r\nforward in great numbers and with loud shouts. When they had reached the\r\ntop of the hill from which Xenophon was descending, they rolled down\r\nstones, and broke the leg of one man; and Xenophon's shield-bearer\r\ndeserted him, carrying off his shield, 21. but Eurylochus, an Arcadian\r\nfrom Lusia,[187] a heavy-armed soldier, ran to his support, and went on\r\nholding his shield before them both; and the rest went to join those who\r\nwere already drawn up.\r\n\r\n22. The entire Grecian force was now together, and took up their\r\nquarters in a number of good houses, and in the midst of abundance of\r\nprovisions. Wine was so abundant, that they kept it in excavations under\r\nground, which were plastered over.[188] 23. Xenophon and Cheirisophus\r\nnow made an agreement with the enemy, that on receiving the dead bodies\r\nthey should give up the guide; and they performed all funeral rites for\r\nthe deceased, as far as they could, according to what is usually done at\r\nthe interment of brave men. 24. The next day they proceeded without a\r\nguide; and the enemy, sometimes by skirmishing, and sometimes, where\r\nthere was a narrow pass, by pre-occupying it, endeavoured to obstruct\r\ntheir progress. 25. Whenever therefore they impeded the front, Xenophon,\r\nascending the hills from the rear, endeavoured to break through the\r\nopposition made in that quarter, trying always to reach higher ground\r\nthan the obstructing enemy; 26. and when they assailed the rear,\r\nCheirisophus, quitting his place, and striving also to get above the\r\nenemy, removed the obstruction that was offered to the passage of that\r\npart of the army. Thus they relieved and supported each other with\r\neffect. 27. Sometimes, too, when the Greeks had ascended eminences, the\r\nBarbarians gave them great annoyance in their descent; and, as they were\r\nnimble, they could escape, though they had but a very short start of\r\nus;[189] for they were encumbered with no other weapons than bows and\r\nslings. 28. As archers they were very expert, and had bows nearly three\r\ncubits long, and arrows above two cubits; and they drew the string,\r\nwhenever they discharged their arrows, advancing the left foot[190]\r\nagainst the lower extremity of the bow. Their arrows penetrated through\r\nshields and corslets; and the Greeks, taking them up, made use of them\r\nas javelins, fixing thongs to them.[191] In these parts the Cretans were\r\nof the greatest service. Stratocles, a Cretan, had the command of them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: Xenophon and Cheirisophus. _Kühner_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: Τὴν φανερὰν ἔκβασιν.] Xenophon calls the passage to the\r\ntop of the mountain an ἔκβασις, or egress, with reference to the Greeks,\r\nto whom it was a way of escape from a disagreeable position. _Kühner_ ad\r\nc. 5. 20. The same words are repeated by Xenophon in the next sect.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: Ὁλοιτρόχους.] A word borrowed from Homer, signifying\r\nproperly _a round stone fit for rolling_, or _a stone that has been made\r\nround by rolling_, as a pebble in the sea. It was originally an\r\nadjective, with πέτρος understood. Most critics suppose it to be from\r\nὅλος and τρέχω, _totus teres atque rotundus_. Liddell and Scott derive\r\nit from εἴλω, _volvo_.

Spelman translates λάκκοι κονιατοί, \"plastered cisterns,\" a\r\nterm which Ainsworth adopts. \"The plastered cisterns noticed by\r\nXenophon,\" says he, \"are also met with throughout Kurdistan, Armenia,\r\nand Syria. They are especially numerous around some of the ancient\r\nvillages of the early Christians of those countries, as more especially\r\nbetween Semeïsát and Bireh-jik, and have frequently been a subject of\r\ndiscussion as to their former uses. This notice of Xenophon serves to\r\nclear up many doubts upon the subject, although, since the Kurds have\r\nbecome Mohommedans, and rejected the use of wine, there is no doubt they\r\nare sometimes used for depots for corn or hay, and even sometimes for\r\nwater. They were generally closed by a single large stone.\" _Travels in\r\nthe Track, &c._ p. 164.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: Ἐγγύθεν φεύγοντες.] \"Fleeing from near,\" i. e. when they\r\nwere at no great distance before us.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: Τῷ ἀριστερῷ ποδὶ προσβαίνοντες.] All the manuscripts have\r\nπροσβαίνοντες: προσβαινοντες is a conjecture of Wesseling ad Diod.

The writer of the article\r\n_Ansa_ in Smith's Dict. of G. and R. Ant. thinks, however that the two\r\nwere not the same.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     The Greeks arrive at the river Centrites, which divides the\r\n     Carduchi from Armenia. They see the Persians drawn up on the\r\n     opposite bank, while the Carduchi threaten their rear. They are\r\n     encouraged by a dream of Xenophon's to try a ford, and effect a\r\n     safe passage across the stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. This day the Greeks abode in the villages above the plain near the\r\nriver Centrites, the breadth of which is about two hundred feet, and\r\nwhich forms the boundary between Armenia and the territory of the\r\nCarduchi. Here they took some rest, being glad to see a piece of level\r\ncountry. The river is distant from the mountains of the Carduchi about\r\nsix or seven stadia. 2. It was with great satisfaction that they stayed\r\nhere, as they had a sufficiency of provisions, and were frequently\r\nreflecting on the difficulties that were past, for, during seven days\r\nthat they had been marching among the Carduchi, they had been constantly\r\nfighting, and had suffered more evils than all those which they had\r\nendured from the king and Tissaphernes.[192] Having escaped from such\r\nhardships, they gladly took repose.\r\n\r\n3. At day-break, however, they perceived on the other side of the river\r\na body of cavalry, in complete armour, ready to prevent them from\r\ncrossing, and on the high banks above the cavalry, another of foot\r\nprepared to hinder them from entering Armenia. 4. These were Armenians,\r\nMardians, and Chaldæans, mercenary troops of Orontes and Artuchas.[193]\r\nThe Chaldæans were said to be a free people, and warlike; for arms they\r\nhad long shields and spears. 5. The high banks on which these forces\r\nwere drawn up, were three or four hundred feet from the river; and the\r\nonly road that was visible was one that led upward, apparently a work of\r\nart. Here the Greeks endeavoured to cross, 6. but as, on making trial,\r\nthe water rose above their breasts, and the bed of the river was rough\r\nwith large and slippery stones, and as it was impossible for them to\r\ncarry their arms in the water, or, if they attempted to do so, the river\r\nswept them away, (while, if any of them took their arms on their heads,\r\nthey became exposed to the arrows and other missiles of the enemy,) they\r\nin consequence retreated, and encamped at the side of the river.\r\n\r\n7. They now perceived the Carduchi assembled in great numbers under arms\r\non the spot where they themselves had been on the previous night. Hence\r\ngreat despondency was felt by the Greeks, as they knew the difficulty of\r\npassing the river, and saw the Carduchi ready to attack them if they\r\nattempted to cross. 8. This day, therefore, and the following night,\r\nthey remained where they were in great perplexity. Xenophon however had\r\na dream; he thought that he was bound in fetters, but that they fell off\r\nhim of their own accord, so that he was set at liberty, and walked\r\nsecurely[194] whithersoever he pleased. 9. When the morning approached,\r\nhe went to Cheirisophus, told him that he had hopes that all would be\r\nwell, and related to him his dream. Cheirisophus was much pleased, and,\r\nas soon as it was day, all the generals who were present offered\r\nsacrifice, and the victims were favourable at the very first. As soon as\r\nthey left the place of sacrifice, the generals and captains gave\r\ndirections to the troops to take their breakfast.\r\n\r\n10. While Xenophon was at breakfast, two young men came running up to\r\nhim, for every one knew that it was allowable to approach him whether\r\nbreakfasting or supping, and to wake him and speak to him even when\r\nasleep, if they had anything to tell of affairs relating to the war. 11.\r\nThe youths informed him that they had been gathering sticks for their\r\nfire, and had chanced to see, on the opposite side of the river, among\r\nthe rocks that reached down to the stream itself, an old man, a woman,\r\nand some girls, depositing in a cavernous rock what appeared to be bags\r\nof clothes; 12. that when they saw this, they thought it would be safe\r\nto cross, as the ground at that point was inaccessible to the enemy's\r\nhorse; that having taken off their clothes, and taken their daggers in\r\ntheir hands, they went over undressed, in expectation of having to swim,\r\nbut that, as they went on, they reached the other side before they were\r\nwet to the middle, and, having thus forded the stream, and taken the\r\nclothes, they came back again. 13. Xenophon immediately therefore made a\r\nlibation, and ordered the young men to join in it,[195] and to pray to\r\nthe gods who had sent the dream and pointed out the ford, to complete\r\nwhat was wanting to their success. After the libation, he at once\r\nconducted the youths to Cheirisophus, and to him they gave the same\r\naccount. Cheirisophus, on hearing it, made a libation also.\r\n\r\n14. When the libation was over, they gave orders to the soldiers to get\r\ntheir baggage ready; while they themselves, calling the rest of the\r\ngenerals together, consulted with them how they might cross the river to\r\nthe best advantage, and how they might defeat the enemy in front, and\r\nsuffer no damage from those in the rear. 15. It was then resolved that\r\nCheirisophus should take the lead, and cross over with half of the army,\r\nthat the other half should stay behind with Xenophon, and that the\r\nbaggage-cattle and camp-followers should go over between the two. 16.\r\nWhen these matters were fairly arranged, they began to move, the young\r\nmen acting as guides, and keeping the river on the left, the distance to\r\nthe ford being about four stadia. 17. As they proceeded, the lines of\r\nthe enemy's cavalry advanced abreast of them on the opposite bank; and\r\nwhen they came to the ford, and the margin of the river, they halted,\r\nlaying down their arms; and then Cheirisophus himself, placing a chaplet\r\nupon his head,[196] and laying aside his outer garments, took up his\r\narms and commanded the rest to follow his example, directing the\r\ncaptains to lead their troops in files,[197] some on his left hand, and\r\nsome on his right. 18. The augurs at the same time sacrificed victims\r\nover the river;[198] while the enemy plied their bows and slings, but\r\ndid not reach the Greeks. 19. As the sacrifices appeared favourable, all\r\nthe soldiers sung the pæan and raised a shout, and all the women (for\r\nthere were a number of the men's mistresses in the army) joined in the\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n20. Cheirisophus and his men then entered the stream; and Xenophon,\r\ntaking the most active of the rear-guard, marched at full speed back to\r\nthe ford[199] opposite the outlet into the mountains of Armenia, making\r\na feint that he meant to cross the river there, and thus cut off the\r\ncavalry that were on the bank; 21. when the enemy, seeing Cheirisophus\r\nand his men crossing over with ease, and Xenophon and his party hurrying\r\nback, were afraid of being intercepted, and fled with precipitation to\r\ngain the outlet that led up from the river, and as soon as they came to\r\nthat passage, they directed their course up into the mountains. 22.\r\nLycius, who had the command of the troop of horse, and Æschines, who\r\ncommanded the band of peltasts attending on Cheirisophus, seeing the\r\nenemy retreating with so much haste, set off in pursuit of them; and the\r\nrest of the soldiers called to each other not to stay behind,[200] but\r\nto go along with them up the mountains. 23. But Cheirisophus, when he\r\nhad crossed the river, did not follow the cavalry, but made his way up\r\nthe high banks that reached down to the river, to attack that portion of\r\nthe enemy that were on the more elevated ground.[201] This party on the\r\nheights, however, seeing their cavalry take to flight, abandoned their\r\ncommanding position above the stream.\r\n\r\n24. Xenophon, when he saw that all was going well on the other side,\r\nreturned with all possible speed to join that part of the army which was\r\ncrossing over; for the Carduchi were evidently descending into the\r\nplain, with the view of falling upon the rear. 25. Cheirisophus was now\r\nin possession of the heights, and Lycius, who, with his small party, had\r\nproceeded in pursuit of the enemy, had captured some of their baggage\r\nthat they had left behind, and amongst it some rich garments and\r\ndrinking-cups. 26. The baggage and camp-followers of the Greeks were\r\nstill in the act of crossing; and Xenophon, turning towards the\r\nCarduchi, halted under arms over against them, and ordered the captains\r\nto form each his own company into divisions of five and twenty men,\r\nbringing round each division in line[202] towards the left; and he\r\ndirected both the captains, and the officers of the divisions of five\r\nand twenty, to advance facing the Carduchi, and the rearmost to halt\r\nfacing the river.\r\n\r\n27. The Carduchi, when they observed that the rear-guard of the\r\ncamp-followers was diminished in number, and that they seemed now indeed\r\nto be but few, advanced at a quicker pace, singing at the same time\r\ncertain songs. Cheirisophus, when he saw that all was safe on his own\r\nside, sent the peltasts, and the slingers and archers, to Xenophon,\r\ndesiring them to do whatsoever he should direct. 28. Xenophon, seeing\r\nthem beginning to cross, sent a messenger to desire that they should\r\nremain by the river where they were, without crossing, and that, when\r\nhis own party should begin to cross, they should come forward into the\r\nwater on each side opposite to him, the javelin-men holding their\r\nweapons by the thong,[203] and the archers with their arrows on the\r\nstring, as if with the intention of crossing over, but not to advance\r\nfar into the river. 29. His own men he ordered, as soon as a sling\r\nshould reach them and a shield should ring,[204] to raise the pæan and\r\nrush towards the enemy; and he directed that when the enemy should take\r\nto flight, and the trumpeter should sound the signal of attack[205] from\r\nthe river, the rear should wheel to the right and take the lead, and\r\nthat they should then all run forward as fast as possible, and cross\r\nover at the part where each happened to be stationed, so as not to\r\nimpede one another; telling them that he would be the best man who\r\nshould first reach the opposite side. 30. The Carduchi, seeing that\r\nthose who were left were but few, (for many even of those who had been\r\nordered to stay had gone away, some to take care of the cattle, some of\r\ntheir baggage, and others of their mistresses,) began, in consequence,\r\nto press forward boldly, and to use their slings and bows. 31. The\r\nGreeks then sang the pæan, and rushed upon them at full speed; and the\r\nBarbarians did not stand their charge; for though they were well enough\r\nequipped for a sudden onset and retreat upon the mountains, they were by\r\nno means sufficiently armed to receive an enemy hand to hand. At this\r\njuncture the trumpeter sounded, 32. when the enemy fled still faster,\r\nand the Greeks, turning in the opposite direction, made their way over\r\nthe river with all possible speed. 33. Some of the enemy, perceiving\r\nthis movement, ran back to the river, and wounded a few of our men with\r\ntheir arrows; but the greater number of them, even when the Greeks were\r\non the other side, were observed to continue their flight. 34. The\r\ntroops, meanwhile, that came to meet Xenophon, being carried away by\r\ntheir courage, and advancing too far, repassed the river in the rear of\r\nXenophon's men; and some of these also were wounded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: Yet \"the Carduchian mountains,\" observes Rennell, \"in\r\neffect presented an asylum to the Greeks, who could no other way have\r\nescaped, at least, the reiterated attacks of such a host of enemies,\r\nwhose numbers also were augmenting instead of diminishing. But as a\r\nPersian army could not subsist, or their cavalry act, within the wide\r\nrange of these mountains, the Greeks, by ascending them, got rid of\r\ntheir dreaded enemy. And although, in the mean time, they had to contend\r\nwith an enemy much more brave and persevering, their numbers were fewer,\r\nand they might reasonably expect an earlier escape from them than from\r\nthe Persians. Had they known that the Tigris was fordable under the Zaco\r\nhills, and passed into Mesopotamia, they would still have had the\r\nEuphrates to cross, a yet more difficult river, in the line which they\r\nmust have pursued. Therefore, according to our limited view of things,\r\nit appears that nothing less than such a barrier as these mountains\r\npresented, could have saved the Greeks from eventual destruction, from\r\nthe attacks of the Persians.\" _Illustrations of the Exp. of Curas_, p.\r\n173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: Orontes was satrap of Armenia, iii. 5. 17; Artuchas is\r\nnowhere else mentioned.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: Διαβαίνειν.] \"Ingredi, pedem proferre.\" _Kühner_.

They make a treaty with Tiribazus, the\r\n     governor of the province, and discover his insincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. When they had crossed, and had ranged themselves in order about noon,\r\nthey proceeded through the country of Armenia, consisting wholly of\r\nplains and gently sloping hills, a distance of not less than five\r\nparasangs; for there were no villages near the river, in consequence of\r\nthe hostilities with the Carduchi. 2. The village, however, at which\r\nthey at length arrived, was of considerable size, and contained a palace\r\nfor the satrap;[206] upon most of the houses there were towers[207], and\r\nprovisions were in great plenty.\r\n\r\n3. Hence they proceeded, two days' journey, a distance of ten parasangs,\r\nuntil they passed round the sources of the river Tigris. From hence they\r\nadvanced, three days' journey, fifteen parasangs, to the river\r\nTeleboas, a stream not large, indeed, but of much beauty[208]; and there\r\nwere many villages on its banks. 4. This part of the country was called\r\nWestern Armenia. The deputy-governor of it was Tiribazus, who was an\r\nintimate friend of the king; and no one else, when he was present,\r\nassisted the king to mount his horse. 5. He now rode up with a body of\r\ncavalry, and sending forward an interpreter, said that he wished to\r\nspeak with the commanders. The generals thought proper to hear what he\r\nhad to say, and, advancing within hearing, asked what he wanted. 6. He\r\nreplied, that he wished to make a treaty with them, on the conditions\r\nthat he himself should not hurt the Greeks, and that the Greeks should\r\nnot burn the houses, but should be at liberty to take such provisions as\r\nthey required. This proposal was agreeable to the generals, and they\r\nconcluded a treaty upon these terms.\r\n\r\n7. Hence they proceeded, three days' march, a distance of fifteen\r\nparasangs, through a plain; and Tiribazus followed them with his troops,\r\nkeeping at the distance of about ten stadia. They then came to a\r\npalace,[209] with several villages around it stored with abundance of\r\nprovisions. 8. While they were encamped, there fell a great quantity of\r\nsnow[210] in the night; and in the morning it was thought advisable\r\nthat the companies and officers should take up their quarters in the\r\nneighbouring villages; for they perceived no enemy, and it appeared to\r\nbe safe on account of the quantity of the snow.[211] 9. Here they found\r\nall kinds of excellent provisions, cattle, corn, old wines of great\r\nfragrance, dried grapes, and vegetables of all kinds.\r\n\r\nSome of the soldiers, however, who had strolled away from the camp,\r\nbrought word that they had caught sight of an army, and that many fires\r\nhad been visible during the night. 10. The generals thought it unsafe,\r\ntherefore, for the troops to quarter apart, and resolved to bring the\r\nwhole army together again. They accordingly assembled, for it seemed to\r\nbe clearing up.[212] 11. But as they were passing the night here, there\r\nfell a vast quantity of snow, so that it covered both the arms and the\r\nmen as they lay on the ground. The snow cramped the baggage-cattle, and\r\nthey were very reluctant to rise; for, as they lay, the snow that had\r\nfallen upon them served to keep them warm, when it had not dropped off.\r\n12. But when Xenophon was hardy enough to rise without his outer\r\ngarment, and to cleave wood, some one else then rose, and, taking the\r\nwood from him, cleft it himself. Soon after, the rest got up, and\r\nlighted fires and anointed themselves; 13. for abundance of ointment was\r\nfound there, made of hog's-lard, sesamum,[213] bitter almonds, and\r\nturpentine, which they used instead of oil. Of the same materials also\r\nan odoriferous unguënt was found.\r\n\r\n14. After this it was resolved to quarter again throughout the\r\nvillages, under shelter; and the soldiers went off with great shouting\r\nand delight to the cottages and provisions. Those who had set fire to\r\nthe houses, when they quitted them before, paid the penalty of having to\r\nencamp uncomfortably in the open air. 15. Hence they despatched in the\r\nnight Democrates of Temenos, giving him a detachment of men, to the\r\nhills where the stragglers said that they had seen the fires; they\r\nselected him because he was thought on several former occasions to have\r\nbrought exact information concerning such matters, reporting what was,\r\njust as it appeared, and what was not, as not existing. 16. Having gone,\r\nhe said that he saw no fires, but he brought with him a captive that he\r\nhad taken, having a Persian bow and quiver, and a short battle-axe, such\r\nas the Amazons have. 17. Being asked of what country he was, he said\r\nthat he was a Persian, and that he was going from the army of Tiribazus\r\nto get provisions. They then asked him how large the army was, and for\r\nwhat purpose it was assembled. 18. He said that Tiribazus had his own\r\ntroops, and some mercenaries from the Chalybes and Taochians; and that\r\nhe was prepared to attack the Greeks in their passage over the\r\nmountains, at a narrow defile through which lay their only road.\r\n\r\n19. The generals, on hearing this, resolved to collect the army, and,\r\nleaving a guard, with Sophænetus the Stymphalian as commander over those\r\nwho stayed behind, proceeded to march without delay, taking the man that\r\nhad been captured for their guide. 20. After they had passed the\r\nmountains, the peltasts, who went before the rest, and were the first to\r\ndiscover the enemy's camp, did not wait for the heavy-armed men, but ran\r\nforward with a shout to attack it. 21. The Barbarians, hearing the\r\nnoise, did not stand their ground, but fled; some of them however were\r\nkilled, and about twenty horses taken, as was also the tent of\r\nTiribazus, and in it some couches with silver feet, and drinking-cups,\r\nand some prisoners, who said that they were bakers and cup-bearers. 22.\r\nWhen the officers of the heavy-armed troops heard what had taken place,\r\nthey resolved upon marching back as fast as possible to their own camp,\r\nlest any attempt should be made on those who had been left there.\r\nCalling in the men immediately, therefore, by sound of trumpet, they\r\nreturned to the camp the same day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: Orontes: iii. 5. 17; 4. 3, 4. He was the satrap, as\r\nKrüger thinks, of Eastern Armenia; Tiribazus being called satrap of\r\nWestern Armenia, sect. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: Τύρσεις.] Apparently intended for a sort of defences,\r\nshould the people be attacked by any of their neighbours. Compare v. 2.\r\n5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: Καλὸς μὲν, μέγας δ' οὔ.] I have, with Bornemann and\r\nPoppo, restored this reading, in which all the manuscripts concur.\r\nMuretus, from Demetrius Phalereus, sect. 6 and 121, has given μέγας μὲν\r\nοὔ, καλὸς δέ, and Hutchinson and all other editors down to Bornemann\r\nhave followed him. It cannot be denied that this is the usual order in\r\nsuch phrases; as in iv. 8. 2; vi. 4. 20; but passages are not wanting in\r\nwhich the contrary order is observed; see iv. 6. 2. _Kühner_. As the\r\npiece attributed to Demetrius Phalereus is not genuine, little attention\r\nneed be paid to it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: It would seem to have been the palace of Tiribazus, as\r\nthe one mentioned in sect. 2 was that of Orontes. _Schneider_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: See Diod. Sic. xiv. 28.] Ainsworth speaks of the cold in\r\nthe nights on these Armenian uplands, p. 173. \"When Lucullus, in his\r\nexpedition against Mithridates, marched through Armenia, his army\r\nsuffered as much by the frost and snow as the Greeks under Xenophon;\r\nand, when Alexander Severus returned through this country, many of his\r\nmen lost their hands and feet through excessive cold. Tournefort also\r\ncomplains that at Erzeroum, though situated in a plain, his fingers were\r\nso benumbed with cold, that he could not write till an hour after\r\nsunrise. (See Plutarch in Lucull., and Zonaras's Annals.)\" _Spelman_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: There being no cause to apprehend the approach of an\r\nenemy during such deep snow.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: Διαιθριάζειν.] The commentators rightly interpret this\r\nword disserenascere, \"to clear up.\" _Kühner_; who, however, prefers\r\nσυναιθριάζειν, for which there is good manuscript authority. He\r\ntranslates it, with Bornemann, _simul disserenascere_, \"to clear up at\r\nthe same time;\" so that the one word has little advantage over the\r\nother. Sturz disapproves of the interpretation _disserenascere_, and\r\nwould have both verbs to signify _sub dio agere_, \"to bivouack in the\r\nopen air;\" but the other sense appears preferable.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: See note on i. 2. 22. Oil made of sesamum, or sesama, is\r\nmentioned, says Kühner, by Plin. H. N. xiii. 1, xviii. 10; Q. Curt. vii.\r\n4. 23; Dioscorid. 2. 119-121; Theophrast. de Odoribus, p. 737, ed.\r\nSchneid.; Salmas. Exercit. Plin. p. 727; Interp. ad Aristoph. Pac. 865.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     The Greeks march through an uninhabited tract of country, suffering\r\n     greatly from cold winds, snow, and want of provisions. At length\r\n     they reach some well-stored villages, where they rest seven days.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The next day it was thought necessary to march away as fast as\r\npossible, before the enemy's force should be re-assembled, and get\r\npossession of the pass. Collecting their baggage at once, therefore,\r\nthey set forward through a deep snow, taking with them several guides;\r\nand, having the same day passed the height on which Tiribazus had\r\nintended to attack them, they encamped. 2. Hence they proceeded three\r\ndays' journey through a desert tract of country, a distance of fifteen\r\nparasangs,[214] to the river Euphrates, and passed it without being wet\r\nhigher than the middle. The sources of the river were said not to be far\r\noff. 3. From hence they advanced three days' march, through much snow\r\nand a level plain, a distance of fifteen parasangs; the third day's\r\nmarch was extremely troublesome, as the north-wind blew full in their\r\nfaces, completely parching up everything and benumbing the men. 4. One\r\nof the augurs, in consequence, advised that they should sacrifice to the\r\nwind; and a sacrifice was accordingly offered; when the vehemence of the\r\nwind appeared to every one manifestly to abate. The depth of the snow\r\nwas a fathom;[215] so that many of the baggage-cattle and slaves\r\nperished, with about thirty of the soldiers. 5. They continued to burn\r\nfires through the whole night, for there was plenty of wood at the place\r\nof encampment. But those who came up late could get no wood; those\r\ntherefore who had arrived before, and had kindled fires, would not admit\r\nthe late comers to the fire unless they gave them a share of the corn or\r\nother provisions that they had brought. 6. Thus they shared with each\r\nother what they respectively had. In the places where the fires were\r\nmade, as the snow melted, there were formed large pits that reached\r\ndown to the ground; and here there was accordingly opportunity to\r\nmeasure the depth of the snow.\r\n\r\n7. From hence they marched through snow the whole of the following day,\r\nand many of the men contracted the _bulimia_.[216] Xenophon, who\r\ncommanded in the rear, finding in his way such of the men as had fallen\r\ndown with it, knew not what disease it was. 8. But as one of those\r\nacquainted with it, told him that they were evidently affected with\r\n_bulimia_, and that they would get up if they had something to eat, he\r\nwent round among the baggage, and, wherever he saw anything eatable, he\r\ngave it out, and sent such as were able to run to distribute it among\r\nthose diseased, who, as soon as they had eaten, rose up and continued\r\ntheir march. 9. As they proceeded, Cheirisophus came, just as it grew\r\ndark, to a village, and found, at a spring in front of the rampart, some\r\nwomen and girls belonging to the place fetching water. 10. The women\r\nasked them who they were; and the interpreter answered, in the Persian\r\nlanguage, that they were people going from the king to the satrap. They\r\nreplied that he was not there, but about a parasang off. However, as it\r\nwas late, they went with the water-carriers within the rampart, to the\r\nhead man of the village; 11. and here Cheirisophus, and as many of the\r\ntroops as could come up, encamped; but of the rest, such as were unable\r\nto get to the end of the journey, spent the night on the way without\r\nfood or fire; and some of the soldiers lost their lives on that\r\noccasion. 12. Some of the enemy too, who had collected themselves into a\r\nbody, pursued our rear, and seized any of the baggage-cattle that were\r\nunable to proceed, fighting with one another for the possession of them.\r\nSuch of the soldiers, also, as had lost their sight from the effects of\r\nthe snow, or had had their toes mortified by the cold, were left behind.\r\n13. It was found to be a relief to the eyes against the snow, if the\r\nsoldiers kept something black before them on the march, and to the feet,\r\nif they kept constantly in motion, and allowed themselves no rest, and\r\nif they took off their shoes in the night; 14. but as to such as slept\r\nwith their shoes on, the straps worked into their feet, and the soles\r\nwere frozen about them; for when their old shoes had failed them, shoes\r\nof raw hides had been made by the men themselves from the newly-skinned\r\noxen. 15. From such unavoidable sufferings, some of the soldiers were\r\nleft behind, who, seeing a piece of ground of a black appearance, from\r\nthe snow having disappeared there, conjectured that it must have melted;\r\nand it had in fact melted in the spot from the effect of a fountain,\r\nwhich was sending up vapour in a woody hollow close at hand. Turning\r\naside thither, they sat down and refused to proceed farther. 16.\r\nXenophon, who was with the rear-guard, as soon as he heard this, tried\r\nto prevail on them by every art and means not to be left behind, telling\r\nthem, at the same time, that the enemy were collected, and pursuing them\r\nin great numbers. At last he grew angry; and they told him to kill them,\r\nas they were quite unable to go forward. 17. He then thought it the best\r\ncourse to strike a terror, if possible, into the enemy that were behind,\r\nlest they should fall upon the exhausted soldiers. It was now dark, and\r\nthe enemy were advancing with a great noise, quarrelling about the booty\r\nthat they had taken; 18. when such of the rear-guard as were not\r\ndisabled, started up, and rushed towards them, while the tired men,\r\nshouting as loud as they could, clashed their spears against their\r\nshields. The enemy, struck with alarm, threw themselves among the snow\r\ninto the hollow, and no one of them afterwards made themselves heard\r\nfrom any quarter.\r\n\r\n19. Xenophon, and those with him, telling the sick men that a party\r\nshould come to their relief next day, proceeded on their march, but\r\nbefore they had gone four stadia, they found other soldiers resting by\r\nthe way in the snow, and covered up with it, no guard being stationed\r\nover them. They roused them up, but they said that the head of the army\r\nwas not moving forward. 20. Xenophon, going past them, and sending on\r\nsome of the ablest of the peltasts, ordered them to ascertain what it\r\nwas that hindered their progress. They brought word that the whole army\r\nwas in that manner taking rest. 21. Xenophon and his men, therefore,\r\nstationing such a guard as they could, took up their quarters there\r\nwithout fire or supper. When it was near day, he sent the youngest of\r\nhis men to the sick, telling them to rouse them and oblige them to\r\nproceed. 22. At this juncture Cheirisophus sent some of his people from\r\nthe villages to see how the rear were faring. The young men were\r\nrejoiced to see them, and gave them the sick to conduct to the camp,\r\nwhile they themselves went forward, and, before they had gone twenty\r\nstadia, found themselves at the village in which Cheirisophus was\r\nquartered. 23. When they came together, it was thought safe enough to\r\nlodge the troops up and down in the villages. Cheirisophus accordingly\r\nremained where he was, and the other officers, appropriating by lot the\r\nseveral villages that they had in sight, went to their respective\r\nquarters with their men.\r\n\r\n24. Here Polycrates, an Athenian captain, requested leave of absence,\r\nand, taking with him the most active of his men, and hastening to the\r\nvillage which Xenophon had been allotted, surprised all the villagers,\r\nand their head man, in their houses, together with seventeen[217] colts\r\nthat were bred as a tribute for the king, and the head man's daughter,\r\nwho had been but nine days married; her husband was gone out to hunt\r\nhares, and was not found in any of the villages. 25. Their houses were\r\nunder ground, the entrance like the mouth of a well, but spacious below;\r\nthere were passages dug into them for the cattle, but the people\r\ndescended by ladders. In the houses were goats, sheep, cows, and fowls,\r\nwith their young; all the cattle were kept on fodder within the\r\nwalls.[218] 26. There was also wheat, barley, leguminous vegetables,\r\nand barley-wine,[219] in large bowls; the grains of barley floated in\r\nit even with the brims of the vessels, and reeds also lay in it, some\r\nlarger and some smaller, without joints; 27. and these, when any one was\r\nthirsty, he was to take in his mouth, and suck.[220] The liquor was very\r\nstrong, unless one mixed water with it, and a very pleasant drink to\r\nthose accustomed to it.\r\n\r\n28. Xenophon made the chief man of his village sup with him, and told\r\nhim to be of good courage, assuring him that he should not be deprived\r\nof his children, and that they would not go away without filling his\r\nhouse with provisions in return for what they took, if he would but\r\nprove himself the author of some service to the army till they should\r\nreach another tribe. 29. This he promised, and, to show his good-will,\r\npointed out where some wine[221] was buried. This night, therefore, the\r\nsoldiers rested in their several quarters in the midst of great\r\nabundance, setting a guard over the chief, and keeping his children at\r\nthe same time under their eye. 30. The following day Xenophon took the\r\nhead man and went with him to Cheirisophus, and wherever he passed by a\r\nvillage, he turned aside to visit those who were quartered in it, and\r\nfound them in all parts feasting and enjoying themselves; nor would they\r\nanywhere let them go till they had set refreshments before them; 31. and\r\nthey placed everywhere upon the same table lamb, kid, pork, veal, and\r\nfowl, with plenty of bread both of wheat and barley. 32. Whenever any\r\nperson, to pay a compliment, wished to drink to another, he took him to\r\nthe large bowl, where he had to stoop down and drink, sucking like an\r\nox. The chief they allowed to take whatever he pleased, but he accepted\r\nnothing from them; where he found any of his relatives, however, he took\r\nthem with him.\r\n\r\n33. When they came to Cheirisophus, they found his men also feasting in\r\ntheir quarters,[222] crowned with wreaths made of hay, and Armenian\r\nboys, in their Barbarian dresses, waiting upon them, to whom they made\r\nsigns what they were to do as if they had been deaf and dumb. 34. When\r\nCheirisophus and Xenophon had saluted one another, they both asked the\r\nchief man, through the interpreter who spoke the Persian language, what\r\ncountry it was. He replied that it was Armenia. They then asked him for\r\nwhom the horses were bred; and he said that they were a tribute for the\r\nking, and added that the neighbouring country was that of the Chalybes,\r\nand told them in what direction the road lay. 35. Xenophon then went\r\naway, conducting the chief back to his family, giving him the horse that\r\nhe had taken, which was rather old, to fatten and offer in sacrifice,\r\n(for he had heard that it had been consecrated to the sun,) being\r\nafraid, indeed, that it might die, as it had been injured by the\r\njourney. He then took some of the young horses, and gave one of them to\r\neach of the other generals and captains. 36. The horses in this country\r\nwere smaller than those of Persia, but far more spirited. The chief\r\ninstructed the men to tie little bags round the feet of the horses, and\r\nother cattle, when they drove them through the snow, for without such\r\nbags they sunk up to their bellies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: Rennell, p. 214, and Kinneir, p. 485, think this distance\r\ntoo great for troops marching through deep snow.

After wandering through\r\n     the country for seven days, they arrive at the Phasis, and in two\r\n     days more at some mountains occupied by the Phasiani, Taochi, and\r\n     Chalybes, whom, by skilful manœuvring, they dislodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. When the eighth day was come, Xenophon committed the guide to\r\nCheirisophus. He left the chief[223] all the members of his family,\r\nexcept his son, a youth just coming to mature age; him he gave in charge\r\nto Episthenes of Amphipolis, in order that if the father should conduct\r\nthem properly, he might return home with him. At the same time they\r\ncarried to his house as many provisions as they could, and then broke up\r\ntheir camp, and resumed their march. 2. The chief conducted them through\r\nthe snow, walking at liberty. When he came to the end of the third day's\r\nmarch, Cheirisophus was angry at him for not guiding them to some\r\nvillages. He said that there were none in that part of the country.\r\nCheirisophus then struck him, but did not confine him; 3. and in\r\nconsequence he ran off in the night, leaving his son behind him. This\r\naffair, the ill-treatment and neglect of the guide, was the only cause\r\nof dissension between Cheirisophus and Xenophon during the march.\r\nEpisthenes conceived an affection for the youth, and, taking him home,\r\nfound him extremely attached to him.\r\n\r\n4. After this occurrence they proceeded seven days' journey, five\r\nparasangs each day, till they came to the river Phasis,[224] the breadth\r\nof which is a plethrum. 5. Hence they advanced two days' journey, ten\r\nparasangs; when, on the pass that led over the mountains into the plain,\r\nthe Chalybes, Taochi, and Phasians were drawn up to oppose their\r\nprogress. 6. Cheirisophus, seeing these enemies in possession of the\r\nheight, came to a halt, at the distance of about thirty stadia, that he\r\nmight not approach them while leading the army in a column. He\r\naccordingly ordered the other officers to bring up their companies, that\r\nthe whole force might be formed in line.[225]\r\n\r\n7. When the rear-guard was come up, he called together the generals and\r\ncaptains, and spoke to them as follows: \"The enemy, as you see, are in\r\npossession of the pass over the mountains; and it is proper for us to\r\nconsider how we may encounter them to the best advantage. 8. It is my\r\nopinion, therefore, that we should direct the troops to get their\r\ndinner, and that we ourselves should hold a council, in the mean time,\r\nwhether it is advisable to cross the mountain to-day or to-morrow.\" 9.\r\n\"It seems best to me,\" exclaimed Cleanor, \"to march at once, as soon as\r\nwe have dined and resumed our arms, against the enemy; for if we waste\r\nthe present day in inaction, the enemy who are now looking down upon us\r\nwill grow bolder, and it is likely that, as their confidence is\r\nincreased, others will join them in greater numbers.\"\r\n\r\n10. After him Xenophon said, \"I am of opinion, that if it is necessary\r\nto fight, we ought to make our arrangements so as to fight with the\r\ngreatest advantage; but that, if we propose to pass the mountains as\r\neasily as possible, we ought to consider how we may incur the fewest\r\nwounds and lose the fewest men. 11. The range of hills, as far as we\r\nsee, extends more than sixty stadia in length; but the people nowhere\r\nseem to be watching us except along the line of road; and it is\r\ntherefore better, I think, to endeavour to try to seize unobserved some\r\npart of the unguarded range, and to get possession of it, if we can,\r\nbeforehand, than to attack a strong post and men prepared to resist us.\r\n12. For it is far less difficult to march up a steep ascent without\r\nfighting than along a level road with enemies on each side; and, in the\r\nnight, if men are not obliged to fight, they can see better what is\r\nbefore them than by day if engaged with enemies; while a rough road is\r\neasier to the feet to those who are marching without molestation than a\r\nsmooth one to those who are pelted on the head with missiles. 13. Nor do\r\nI think it at all impracticable for us to steal a way for ourselves, as\r\nwe can march by night, so as not to be seen, and can keep at such a\r\ndistance from the enemy as to allow no possibility of being heard. We\r\nseem likely, too, in my opinion, if we make a pretended attack on this\r\npoint, to find the rest of the range still less guarded; for the enemy\r\nwill so much the more probably stay where they are. 14. But why should I\r\nspeak doubtfully about stealing? For I hear that you Lacedæmonians, O\r\nCheirisophus, such of you at least as are of the better class,[226]\r\npractise stealing from your boyhood, and it is not a disgrace, but an\r\nhonour, to steal whatever the law does not forbid; 15. while, in order\r\nthat you may steal with the utmost dexterity, and strive to escape\r\ndiscovery, it is appointed by law that, if you are caught stealing, you\r\nare scourged. It is now high time for you, therefore, to give proof of\r\nyour education, and to take care that we may not receive many stripes.\"\r\n16. \"But I hear that you Athenians also,\" rejoined Cheirisophus, \"are\r\nvery clever at stealing the public money, though great danger threatens\r\nhim that steals it; and that your best men steal it most, if indeed your\r\nbest men are thought worthy to be your magistrates; so that it is time\r\nfor you likewise to give proof of your education.\" 17. \"I am then\r\nready,\" exclaimed Xenophon, \"to march with the rear-guard, as soon as we\r\nhave supped, to take possession of the hills. I have guides too; for our\r\nlight-armed men captured some of the marauders following us by lying in\r\nambush; and from them I learn that the mountains are not impassable, but\r\nare grazed over by goats and oxen, so that if we once gain possession of\r\nany part of the range, there will be tracks also for our baggage-cattle.\r\n18. I expect also that the enemy will no longer keep their ground, when\r\nthey see us upon a level with them on the heights, for they will not now\r\ncome down to be upon a level with us.\" 19. Cheirisophus then said, \"But\r\nwhy should you go, and leave the charge of the rear? Rather send others,\r\nunless some volunteers present themselves.\" 20. Upon this Aristonymus of\r\nMethydria came forward with his heavy-armed men, and Aristeas of Chios\r\nand Nicomachus of Œta[227] with their light-armed; and they made an\r\narrangement, that as soon as they should reach the top, they should\r\nlight a number of fires. 21. Having settled these points, they went to\r\ndinner; and after dinner Cheirisophus led forward the whole army ten\r\nstadia towards the enemy, that he might appear to be fully resolved to\r\nmarch against them on that quarter.\r\n\r\n22. When they had taken their supper, and night came on, those\r\nappointed for the service went forward and got possession of the hills;\r\nthe other troops rested where they were. The enemy, when they saw the\r\nheights occupied, kept watch and burned a number of fires all night. 23.\r\nAs soon as it was day, Cheirisophus, after having offered sacrifice,\r\nmarched forward along the road; while those who had gained the heights\r\nadvanced by the ridge. 24. Most of the enemy, meanwhile, stayed at the\r\npass, but a part went to meet the troops coming along the heights. But\r\nbefore the main bodies came together, those on the ridge closed with one\r\nanother, and the Greeks had the advantage, and put the enemy to flight.\r\n25. At the same time the Grecian peltasts ran up from the plain to\r\nattack the enemy drawn up to receive them, and Cheirisophus followed at\r\na quick pace with the heavy-armed men. 26. The enemy at the pass,\r\nhowever, when they saw those above defeated, took to flight. Not many of\r\nthem were killed, but a great number of shields were taken, which the\r\nGreeks, by hacking them with their swords, rendered useless. 27. As soon\r\nas they had gained the ascent, and had sacrificed and erected a trophy,\r\nthey went down into the plain before them, and arrived at a number of\r\nvillages stored with abundance of excellent provisions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: This is rather oddly expressed; for the guide and the\r\nchief were the same person.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: Not the Colchian Phasis, which flows into the Euxine, but\r\na river of Armenia (Ἀράξης, now _Aras_) which runs into the Caspian. See\r\nAinsworth, Travels, p. 179, 247. However Xenophon himself seems to have\r\nconfounded this Phasis with that of Colchis. See Rennell, p. 230.\r\n_Kühner_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: Ἐπὶ φάλαγγος.] See on iv. 3. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: Τῶν ὁμοίων.] The ὅμοιοι at Sparta were all those who had\r\nan equal right to participate in the honours or offices of the state;\r\n_qui pari inter se jure gaudebant, quibus honores omnes æqualiter\r\npatebant_.

See Hellen. iii. 3. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: A native of the country about Mount Œta in Thessaly.\r\nThere was also however a town of that name in the south of Thessaly:\r\nThucyd. iii. 92.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     The Greeks, entering the country of the Taochi, storm a fort,\r\n     capturing a great number of cattle, on which they subsist while\r\n     traversing the region of the Chalybes. They cross the Harpasus,\r\n     and, marching through the territory of the Scythini, arrive at a\r\n     town called Gymnias, whence they are conducted to Mount Theches,\r\n     from the top of which they see the Euxine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. From hence they marched five days' journey, thirty parasangs, to the\r\ncountry of the Taochi, where provisions began to fail them; for the\r\nTaochi inhabited strong fastnesses, in which they had laid up all their\r\nsupplies. 2. Having at length, however, arrived at one place which had\r\nno city or houses attached to it, but in which men and women and a great\r\nnumber of cattle were assembled, Cheirisophus, as soon as he came before\r\nit, made it the object of an attack; and when the first division that\r\nassailed it began to be tired, another succeeded, and then another; for\r\nit was not possible for them to surround it in a body, as there was a\r\nriver about it. 3. When Xenophon came up with his rear-guard, peltasts,\r\nand heavy-armed men, Cheirisophus exclaimed, \"You come seasonably, for\r\nwe must take this place, as there are no provisions for the army, unless\r\nwe take it.\"\r\n\r\n4. They then deliberated together, and Xenophon asking what hindered\r\nthem from taking the place, Cheirisophus replied, \"The only approach to\r\nit is the one which you see; but when any of our men attempt to pass\r\nalong it, the enemy roll down stones over yonder impending rock, and\r\nwhoever is struck, is treated as you behold;\" and he pointed, at the\r\nsame moment, to some of the men who had had their legs and ribs broken.\r\n5. \"But if they expend all their stones,\" rejoined Xenophon, \"is there\r\nanything else to prevent us from advancing? For we see, in front of us,\r\nonly a few men, and but two or three of them armed. 6. The space, too,\r\nthrough which we have to pass under exposure to the stones, is, as you\r\nsee, only about a hundred and fifty feet in length; and of this about a\r\nhundred feet is covered with large pine trees in groups, against which\r\nif the men place themselves, what would they suffer either from the\r\nflying stones or the rolling ones? The remaining part of the space is\r\nnot above fifty feet, over which, when the stones cease, we must pass at\r\na running pace.\" 7. \"But,\" said Cheirisophus, \"the instant we offer to\r\ngo to the part covered with trees, the stones fly in great numbers.\"\r\n\"That,\" cried Xenophon, \"would be the very thing we want, for thus they\r\nwill exhaust their stones the sooner. Let us then advance, if we can, to\r\nthe point whence we shall have but a short way to run, and from which we\r\nmay, if we please, easily retreat.\"\r\n\r\n8. Cheirisophus and Xenophon, with Callimachus of Parrhasia, one of the\r\ncaptains, who had that day the lead of all the other captains of the\r\nrear-guard, then went forward, all the rest of the captains remaining\r\nout of danger. Next, about seventy of the men advanced under the trees,\r\nnot in a body, but one by one, each sheltering himself as he could. 9.\r\nAgasias of Stymphalus, and Aristonymus of Methydria, who were also\r\ncaptains of the rear-guard, with some others, were at the same time\r\nstanding behind, without the trees, for it was not safe for more than\r\none company to stand under them. 10. Callimachus then adopted the\r\nfollowing stratagem: he ran forward two or three paces from the tree\r\nunder which he was sheltered, and when the stones began to be hurled,\r\nhastily drew back; and at each of his sallies more than ten cartloads of\r\nstones were spent. 11. Agasias, observing what Callimachus was doing,\r\nand that the eyes of the whole army were upon him, and fearing that he\r\nhimself might not be the first to enter the place, began to advance\r\nalone, (neither calling to Aristonymus who was next him, nor to\r\nEurylochus of Lusia, both of whom were his intimate friends, nor to any\r\nother person,) and passed by all the rest. 12. Callimachus, seeing him\r\nrushing by, caught hold of the rim of his shield, and at that moment\r\nAristonymus of Methydria ran past them both, and after him Eurylochus of\r\nLusia, for all these sought distinction for valour, and were rivals to\r\none another; and thus, in mutual emulation, they got possession of the\r\nplace, for when they had once rushed in, not a stone was hurled from\r\nabove. 13. But a dreadful spectacle was then to be seen; for the women,\r\nflinging their children over the precipice, threw themselves after them;\r\nand the men followed their example. Æneas of Stymphalus, a captain,\r\nseeing one of them, who had on a rich garment, running to throw himself\r\nover, caught hold of it with intent to stop him. 14. But the man dragged\r\nhim forward, and they both went rolling down the rocks together, and\r\nwere killed. Thus very few prisoners were taken, but a great number of\r\noxen, asses, and sheep.\r\n\r\n15. Hence they advanced, seven days' journey, a distance of fifty\r\nparasangs, through the country of the Chalybes. These were the most\r\nwarlike people of all that they passed through, and came to close combat\r\nwith them. They had linen cuirasses, reaching down to the groin, and,\r\ninstead of skirts,[228] thick cords twisted. 16. They had also greaves\r\nand helmets, and at their girdles a short faulchion, as large as a\r\nSpartan crooked dagger, with which they cut the throats of all whom they\r\ncould master, and then, cutting off their heads, carried them away with\r\nthem. They sang and danced when the enemy were likely to see them. They\r\ncarried also a spear of about fifteen cubits in length, having one\r\nspike.[229] 17. They stayed in their villages till the Greeks had\r\npassed by, when they pursued and perpetually harassed them. They had\r\ntheir dwellings in strong places, in which they had also laid up their\r\nprovisions, so that the Greeks could get nothing from that country, but\r\nlived upon the cattle which they taken from the Taochi.\r\n\r\n18. The Greeks next arrived at the river Harpasus, the breadth of which\r\nwas four plethra. Hence they proceeded through the territory of the\r\nScythini, four days' journey, making twenty parasangs, over a level\r\ntract, until they came to some villages, in which they halted three\r\ndays, and collected provisions. 19. From this place they advanced four\r\ndays' journey, twenty parasangs, to a large, rich, and populous city,\r\ncalled Gymnias, from which the governor of the country sent the Greeks a\r\nguide, to conduct them through a region at war with his own people. 20.\r\nThe guide, when he came, said that he would take them in five days to a\r\nplace whence they should see the sea; if not, he would consent to be put\r\nto death. When, as he proceeded, he entered the country of their\r\nenemies, he exhorted them to burn and lay waste the lands; whence it was\r\nevident that he had come for this very purpose, and not from any good\r\nwill to the Greeks. 21. On the fifth day they came to the mountain;[230]\r\nand the name of it was Theches. When the men who were in the front had\r\nmounted the height, and looked down upon the sea, a great shout\r\nproceeded from them; 22. and Xenophon and the rear-guard, on hearing it,\r\nthought that some new enemies were assailing the front, for in the rear,\r\ntoo, the people from the country that they had burnt were following\r\nthem, and the rear-guard, by placing an ambuscade, had killed some, and\r\ntaken others prisoners, and had captured about twenty shields made of\r\nraw ox-hides with the hair on. 23. But as the noise still increased, and\r\ndrew nearer, and as those who came up from time to time kept running at\r\nfull speed to join those who were continually shouting, the cries\r\nbecoming louder as the men became more numerous, it appeared to\r\nXenophon that it must be something of very great moment. 24. Mounting\r\nhis horse, therefore, and taking with him Lycius and the cavalry, he\r\nhastened forward to give aid, when presently they heard the soldiers\r\nshouting, \"The sea, the sea!\" and cheering on one another. They then all\r\nbegan to run, the rear-guard as well as the rest, and the baggage-cattle\r\nand horses were put to their speed; 25. and when they had all arrived at\r\nthe top, the men embraced one another, and their generals and captains,\r\nwith tears in their eyes. Suddenly, whoever it was that suggested it,\r\nthe soldiers brought stones, and raised a large mound, 26. on which they\r\nlaid a number of raw ox-hides,[231] staves, and shields taken from the\r\nenemy. The shields the guide himself hacked in pieces,[232] and exhorted\r\nthe rest to do the same. 27. Soon after, the Greeks sent away the guide,\r\ngiving him presents from the common stock, a horse, a silver cup, a\r\nPersian robe, and ten darics;[233] but he showed most desire for the\r\nrings on their fingers, and obtained many of them from the soldiers.\r\nHaving then pointed out to them a village where they might take up their\r\nquarters, and the road by which they were to proceed to the Macrones,\r\nwhen the evening came on he departed, pursuing his way during the night.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: Ἀντὶ τῶν πτερύγων.] That this is the true sense of this\r\nword appears from Xen. de Re Equest. 12. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: Having one iron point at the upper end, as in v. 4. 12,\r\nand no point at the lower for fixing the spear in the ground.\r\n_Schneider_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: The word ἱερόν, which precedes ὄρος in the older\r\neditions, is enclosed in brackets, as being probably spurious, by most\r\nof the modern editors, and actually ejected by Dindorf. Yet something\r\nseems to be wanting in connexion with ὄρος, for the guide (sect. 20)\r\nsays merely that he will bring them to α χωρίον, and on the fifth day\r\nafter it is said that they come to _the mountain_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: They appear to be the hides of oxen offered up as a sort\r\nof sacrifice to the gods. _Balfour_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: In order, says Krüger, to render them useless, so that\r\nthey might not be carried off by any of the neighbouring people.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: i. 1. 9.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     The Greeks proceed unmolested through the country of the Macrones,\r\n     and enter Colchis. Putting to flight the Colchians who obstructed\r\n     their passage, they arrive at Trebisond, a Greek city, where they\r\n     perform whatever vows they had made, and celebrate games.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Hence the Greeks advanced three days' journey, a distance of ten\r\nparasangs, through the country of the Macrones. On the first day they\r\ncame to a river which divides the territories of the Macrones from those\r\nof the Scythini. 2. On their right they had an eminence extremely\r\ndifficult of access, and on their left another river,[234] into which\r\nthe boundary river, which they had to cross, empties itself. This stream\r\nwas thickly edged with trees, not indeed large, but growing closely\r\ntogether. These the Greeks, as soon as they came to the spot, cut\r\ndown,[235] being in haste to get out of the country as soon as possible.\r\n3. The Macrones, however, equipped with wicker shields, and spears, and\r\nhair tunics, were drawn up on the opposite side of the crossing-place;\r\nthey were animating one another, and throwing stones into the\r\nriver.[236] They did not hit our men, or cause them any inconvenience.\r\n\r\n4. At this juncture one of the peltasts came up to Xenophon, saying that\r\nhe had been a slave at Athens, and adding that he knew the language of\r\nthese men. \"I think, indeed,\" said he, \"that this is my country, and, if\r\nthere is nothing to prevent, I should wish to speak to the people.\" 5.\r\n\"There is nothing to prevent,\" replied Xenophon; \"so speak to them, and\r\nfirst ascertain what people they are.\" When he asked them, they said\r\nthat they were the Macrones. \"Inquire, then,\" said Xenophon, \"why they\r\nare drawn up to oppose us, and wish to be our enemies.\" 6. They replied,\r\n\"Because you come against our country.\" The generals then told him to\r\nacquaint them that we were not come with any wish to do them injury, but\r\nthat we were returning to Greece after having been engaged in war with\r\nthe king, and that we were desirous to reach the sea. 7. They asked if\r\nthe Greeks would give pledges to this effect; and the Greeks replied\r\nthat they were willing both to give and receive them. The Macrones\r\naccordingly presented the Greeks with a Barbarian lance, and the Greeks\r\ngave them a Grecian one; for they said that such were their usual\r\npledges. Both parties called the gods to witness.\r\n\r\n8. After these mutual assurances, the Macrones immediately assisted them\r\nin cutting away the trees, and made a passage for them, as if to bring\r\nthem over, mingling freely among the Greeks; they also gave such\r\nfacilities as they could for buying provisions, and conducted them\r\nthrough their country for three days, until they brought them to the\r\nconfines of the Colchians. 9. Here was a range of hills,[237] high, but\r\naccessible, and upon them the Colchians were drawn up in array. The\r\nGreeks, at first, drew up against them in a line,[238] with the\r\nintention of marching up the hill in this disposition; but afterwards\r\nthe generals thought proper to assemble and deliberate how they might\r\nengage with the best effect. 10. Xenophon then said it appeared to him\r\nthat they ought to relinquish the arrangement in line, and to dispose\r\nthe troops in columns;[239] \"for a line,\" pursued he, \"will be broken at\r\nonce, as we shall find the hills in some parts impassable, though in\r\nothers easy of access; and this disruption will immediately produce\r\ndespondency in the men, when, after being ranged in a regular line, they\r\nfind it dispersed. 11. Again, if we advance drawn up very many deep, the\r\nenemy will stretch beyond us on both sides, and will employ the parts\r\nthat outreach us in any way they may think proper; and if we advance\r\nonly a few deep, it would not be at all surprising if our line be broken\r\nthrough by showers of missiles and men falling upon us in large bodies.\r\nIf this happen in any part, it will be ill for the whole extent of the\r\nline. 12. I think, then, that having formed our companies in columns, we\r\nshould keep them so far apart from each other as that the last companies\r\non each side may be beyond the enemy's wings. Thus our extreme companies\r\nwill both outflank the line of the enemy, and, as we march in file, the\r\nbravest of our men will close with the enemy first, and wherever the\r\nascent is easiest, there each division will direct its course. 13. Nor\r\nwill it be easy for the enemy to penetrate into the intervening spaces,\r\nwhen there are companies on each side, nor will it be easy to break\r\nthrough a column as it advances; while, if any one of the companies be\r\nhard pressed, the neighbouring one will support it; and if but one of\r\nthe companies can by any path attain the summit, the enemy will no\r\nlonger stand their ground.\" 14. This plan was approved, and they threw\r\nthe companies into columns. Xenophon, riding along from the right wing\r\nto the left, said. \"Soldiers, the enemy whom you see before you, are now\r\nthe only obstacle to hinder us from being where we have long been eager\r\nto be. These, if we can, we must eat up alive.\"[240]\r\n\r\n15. When the men were all in their places, and they had formed the\r\ncompanies into columns, there were about eighty companies of heavy-armed\r\nmen, and each company consisted of about eighty men. The peltasts and\r\narchers they divided into three bodies, each about six hundred men, one\r\nof which they placed beyond the left wing, another beyond the right, and\r\nthe third in the centre. 16. The generals then desired the soldiers to\r\nmake their vows[241] to the gods; and having made them, and sung the\r\npæan, they moved forward. Cheirisophus and Xenophon, and the peltasts\r\nthat they had with them, who were beyond the enemy's flanks, pushed on;\r\n17. and the enemy, observing their motions, and hurrying forward to\r\nreceive them, were drawn off, some to the right and others to the left,\r\nand left a great void in the centre of their line; 18. when the peltasts\r\nin the Arcadian division, whom Æschines the Acarnanian commanded, seeing\r\nthem separate, ran forward in all haste, thinking that they were taking\r\nto flight; and these were the first that reached the summit. The\r\nArcadian heavy-armed troop, of which Cleanor the Orchomenian was\r\ncaptain, followed them. 19. But the enemy, when once the Greeks began to\r\nrun, no longer stood their ground, but went off in flight, some one way\r\nand some another.\r\n\r\nHaving passed the summit, the Greeks encamped in a number of villages\r\ncontaining abundance of provisions. 20. As to other things here, there\r\nwas nothing at which they were surprised; but the number of bee-hives\r\nwas extraordinary, and all the soldiers that ate of the combs, lost\r\ntheir senses, vomited, and were affected with purging, and none of them\r\nwere able to stand upright; such as had eaten only a little were like\r\nmen greatly intoxicated, and such as had eaten much were like mad-men,\r\nand some like persons at the point of death. 21. They lay upon the\r\nground, in consequence, in great numbers, as if there had been a defeat;\r\nand there was general dejection. The next day no one of them was found\r\ndead; and they recovered their senses about the same hour that they had\r\nlost them on the preceding day; and on the third and fourth days they\r\ngot up as if after having taken physic.[242]\r\n\r\n22. From hence they proceeded two days' march, seven parasangs, and\r\narrived at Trebisond, a Greek city, of large population, on the Euxine\r\nSea; a colony of Sinope, but lying in the territory of the Colchians.\r\nHere they stayed about thirty days, encamping in the villages of the\r\nColchians, 23. whence they made excursions and plundered the country of\r\nColchis. The people of Trebisond provided a market for the Greeks in the\r\ncamp, and entertained them in the city; and made them presents of oxen,\r\nbarley-meal, and wine. 24. They negotiated with them also on behalf of\r\nthe neighbouring Colchians, those especially who dwelt in the plain, and\r\nfrom them too were brought presents of oxen.\r\n\r\n25. Soon after, they prepared to perform the sacrifice which they had\r\nvowed. Oxen enough had been brought them to offer to Jupiter the\r\nPreserver, and to Hercules, for their safe conduct, and whatever they\r\nhad vowed to the other gods. They also celebrated gymnastic games upon\r\nthe hill where they were encamped, and chose Dracontius a Spartan, (who\r\nhad become an exile from his country when quite a boy, for having\r\ninvoluntarily killed a child by striking him with a dagger,) to prepare\r\nthe course and preside at the contests. 26. When the sacrifice was\r\nended, they gave the hides[243] to Dracontius, and desired him to\r\nconduct them to the place where he had made the course. Dracontius,\r\npointing to the place where they were standing, said, \"This hill is an\r\nexcellent place for running, in whatever direction the men may wish.\"\r\n\"But how will they be able,\" said they, \"to wrestle on ground so rough\r\nand bushy?\" \"He that falls,\" said he, \"will suffer the more.\" 27. Boys,\r\nmost of them from among the prisoners, contended in the short course,\r\nand in the long course above sixty Cretans ran; while others were\r\nmatched in wrestling, boxing, and the pancratium. It was a fine sight;\r\nfor many entered the lists, and as their friends were spectators, there\r\nwas great emulation. 28. Horses also ran; and they had to gallop down\r\nthe steep, and, turning round in the sea, to come up again to the altar.\r\nIn the descent, many rolled down; but in the ascent, against the\r\nexceedingly steep ground, the horses could scarcely get up at a walking\r\npace. There was consequently great shouting, and laughter, and cheering\r\nfrom the people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: A stream running into the Tchórúk-sú, according to\r\nAinsworth, Travels, p. 189.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: The Greeks cut down the trees in order to throw them into\r\nthe stream, and form a kind of bridge on which they might cross.\r\n_Schneider_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: They threw stones into the river that they might stand on\r\nthem, and approach nearer to the Greeks, so as to use their weapons with\r\nmore effect. _Bornemann_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: Kárá Kapán, or Kóhát Tágh, according to Ainsw. p. 190.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: Κατὰ φάλαγγα.] See on iv. 3. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: Λόχους ὀρθίους.] See on iv. 2. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: Ὠμοὺς ---- κατάφαγεῖν.] \"Eat up raw,\" without waiting to\r\ncook them; a metaphorical expression for _to extirpate utterly and at\r\nonce_, taken from Homer, Il. v. 35: Ὠμὸν βεβρώθοις Πρίαμον Πρίαμοιό τε\r\nμαῖδας.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: See the payment of these vows in sect. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: That there was honey in these parts with intoxicating\r\nqualities, was well known to antiquity. Pliny, H. N. xxi. 44, mentions\r\ntwo sorts of it, one produced at Heraclea in Pontus, and the other among\r\nthe Sanni or Macrones. The peculiarities of the honey arose from the\r\nherbs to which the bees resorted, the first came from the flower of a\r\nplant called ægolethron, or goats'-bane; the other from a species of\r\nrhododendron. Tournefort, when he was in that country, saw honey of this\r\ndescription. See Ainsworth, Travels in the Track, p. 190, who found that\r\nthe intoxicating honey had a bitter taste. See also Rennell, p. 253.\r\n\"This honey is also mentioned by Dioscorides, ii. 103; Strabo, xii. p.\r\n826; Ælian, H. A. v. 42; Procopius, B.
