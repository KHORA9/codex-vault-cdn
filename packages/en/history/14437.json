Ll.D.\r\nAuthor of _Biblical Researches In Palestine_, etc.\r\n\r\nNew-York: George P. Putnam, 155 Broadway\r\n\r\nM.DCCC.L\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present work is founded on an essay, which appeared in the\r\nBiblical Repository for April and July, 1834, then conducted by the\r\nundersigned. The essay was received with favour by the public; and\r\nawakened an interest in many minds, as laying open a new field of\r\ninformation, hitherto almost inaccessible to the English reader. A few\r\ncopies were printed separately for private distribution. Some of these\r\nwere sent to literary men in Europe; and several scholars of high name\r\namong those acquainted with Slavic literature, expressed their\r\napproval of the work. Since that time, and even of late, inquiries\r\nhave repeatedly been made, by scholars and by public libraries in\r\nEurope, for copies of that little treatise; which, of course, it was\r\nimpossible to satisfy.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances, together with the fact, that in these years\r\npublic attention has been more prominently directed to the character\r\nand prospects of the Slavic nations, have induced the author to recast\r\nthe work; and to lay it anew before the public, corrected, enlarged,\r\nand continued to the present time; as a brief contribution to our\r\nknowledge of the intellectual character and condition of those\r\nnations, in the middle of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn its present shape, the work may be said to supply, in a certain\r\ndegree, a deficiency in English literature. It is true, that\r\nthe literature of the Russians, Poles, Bohemians, and some\r\nothers, is treated of under the appropriate heads in the\r\n_Encyclopædia Americana_, in articles translated from the German\r\n_Conversations-Lexicon_, though not in their latest form. The Foreign\r\nQuarterly Review also contains articles of value on the like topics,\r\nscattered throughout its volumes. Dr. Bowring, in the prefaces to some\r\nof his Specimens of Slavic Poetry, has given short notices of a\r\nsimilar kind. The Biblical literature of the Old Slavic and Russian\r\nhas been well exhibited by Dr. Henderson[1]; while an outline of\r\nRussian literature in general is presented in the work of Otto[2].\r\nValuable information respecting the South-western Slavi is contained\r\nin the recent work of Sir J.G. Wilkinson.[3] But beyond this meagre\r\nenumeration, the English reader will find few sources of information\r\nat his command upon these topics. All these, too, are only sketches of\r\nseparate _parts_ of one great whole; of which in its full extent, both\r\nas a whole and in the intimate relation of its parts, no general view\r\nis known to exist in the English language.\r\n\r\nYet the subject in itself is not without a high interest and\r\nimportance; relating, as it does, to the languages and literature of a\r\npopulation amounting to nearly or quite seventy millions, or more than\r\nthree times as great as that of the United States. These topics\r\nembrace, of course, the history of mental cultivation among the Slavic\r\nnations from its earliest dawn; their intellectual development; the\r\nprogress of man among them as a thinking, sentient, social being,\r\nacting and acted upon in his various relations to other minds. They\r\nrelate, indeed, to the history of intellectual culture in one of its\r\nlargest geographical and ethnological divisions.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is a matter of no small interest, to mark the\r\ninfluence which Christianity has exercised upon the language and\r\nliterature of these various nations. It is to the introduction and\r\nprogress of Christianity, that they owe their written language; and to\r\nthe versions of the Scriptures into their own dialects are they\r\nindebted, not only for their moral and religious culture, but also for\r\nthe cultivation and, in a great degree, the existence of their\r\nnational literature. The same influence Christianity is even now\r\nexerting upon the hitherto unwritten languages of the American forest,\r\nof the islands of the Pacific, of the burning coasts of Africa, of the\r\nmountains of Kurdistan; and with the prospect of results still wider\r\nand more propitious. Indeed, wherever we learn the fact, whether in\r\nearlier or more recent times, that a language, previously regarded as\r\nbarbarous, and existing only as oral, has been reclaimed and reduced\r\nto writing, and made the vehicle of communicating fixed thought and\r\npermanent instruction, there it has ever been _Christianity_ and\r\n_Missionary Enterprise_ which have produced these results. It is\r\ngreatly to the honour of Protestant Missions, that their efforts have\r\nalways been directed to introduce the Scriptures and the worship of\r\nGod to the masses of the people in their own native tongue. In this\r\nway they have every where contributed to awaken the intellectual, as\r\nwell as the moral life of nations.\r\n\r\nThe present work has been prepared with great care; and with the aid\r\nof the latest and best sources of information, so far as they were\r\naccessible. The author, however, would be the last to desire, that any\r\none should regard the volume as comprising a full or complete history\r\nof the literature of the seven or eight Slavic nations. Scholars\r\nfamiliar with the subject, and especially intelligent Russian, Polish,\r\nor Bohemian readers, will doubtless discover in it deficiencies and\r\nerrors. Limited to the resources of a private library,--for the public\r\nlibraries of the United States and of Great Britain have as yet\r\naccumulated little or nothing in the Slavic department,--and without\r\nthe privilege of personal intercourse with others acquainted with\r\nSlavic literary matters, the author desires to be distinctly\r\nunderstood, as aiming only to present a _sketch_, an _outline_,--a\r\nwork which may fill its appropriate place, until it shall be\r\nsupplanted by something more perfect.\r\n\r\nThe preceding remarks have reference especially to the first _three_\r\nParts of the volume. In the _fourth_ Part, containing a Sketch of the\r\nPopular Poetry of the Slavic nations, the author is perhaps still more\r\nat home; and the reader, it may be hoped, will receive gratification\r\nfrom the views and specimens there presented. Similar views, and a few\r\nof the same specimens, were given in an article from the same pen, in\r\nthe North American Review for July, 1836.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may not be inappropriate to remark, that\r\ncircumstances have combined to secure to the author some\r\nqualifications for the preparation of a work of this kind, which are\r\nnot common to writers in the English language. A residence of several\r\nyears in early life in Russia, first in the southern provinces, and\r\nafterwards at St. Petersburg, presented opportunity for a personal\r\nacquaintance with the language and literature of that country. At a\r\nlater period, this gave occasion and afforded aid for an extensive\r\nstudy of the Servian dialect and its budding literature; the results\r\nof which were given to the public in a German translation of the very\r\nremarkable popular songs and ballads of that country[4]. The field was\r\nnew: but certainly that can be regarded as no barren soil, nor that as\r\na fruitless labour, which at once drew the attention, and secured to\r\nthe translator the friendship and correspondence, of scholars like\r\nGoethe, von Humboldt; J. Grimm, Savigny, G. Ritter, Kopitar, and\r\nothers. Similar researches were subsequently extended into the popular\r\npoetry of the Teutonic and other nations; a portion of the results of\r\nwhich have likewise been given to the public[5].\r\n\r\nI may venture to commend this volume to the good will and kind\r\nforbearance of the reader, in view of the difficulties which must ever\r\npress upon the writer of such a work. The enterprising publisher has\r\ndone his part well; and I would join him in the hope, that the book\r\nmay prove an acceptable offering to the public.\r\n\r\nE.

The\r\nanalogy between their language and the Sanscrit, seems to indicate\r\ntheir origin from India; but to ascertain the time at which they first\r\nentered Europe, is now no longer possible. Probably this event took\r\nplace seven or eight centuries before the Christian era, on account of\r\nthe over-population of the regions on the Ganges.[1] Herodotus\r\nmentions a people which he called Krovyzi, who lived on the Ister.\r\nThere is even now a tribe in Russia, whose name at least is almost\r\nthe same.[2] Strabo, Pomponius Mela, Pliny, Tacitus, and several other\r\nclassical and a few oriental writers, allude to the Slavic nations\r\noccasionally. But the first distinct intelligence we have of them, is\r\nnot older than the middle of the sixth century.[3] At this period we\r\nsee them traversing the Danube in large multitudes, and settling on\r\nboth the banks of that river. From that time they appear frequently in\r\nthe accounts of the Byzantine historians, under the different\r\nappellations of the Slavi, Sarmatae,[4] Antae, Vandales, Veneti, and\r\nVendes, mostly as involved in the wars of the two Roman empires,\r\nsometimes as allies, sometimes as conquerors; oftener, notwithstanding\r\ntheir acknowledged valour and courage, as vassals; but chiefly as\r\nemigrants and colonists, thrust out of their own countries by the\r\npressing forward of the more warlike German or Teutonic tribes. Only\r\nthe first of the above mentioned names is decidedly of Slavic\r\norigin;[5] the second is ambiguous; and the last four are later and\r\npurely geographical, having been transferred to Slavic nations from\r\nthose who had previously occupied the territory where the Romans first\r\nbecame acquainted with them.\r\n\r\nIt results from the very nature of this information, that we cannot\r\nexpect to get from it any satisfactory knowledge of their political\r\nstate or the degree of their civilization. In general, they appear as\r\na peaceful, industrious, hospitable people, obedient to their chiefs,\r\nand religious in their habits. Wherever they established themselves,\r\nthey began to cultivate the earth, and to trade in the productions of\r\nthe country. There are also early traces of their fondness for music\r\nand poetry; and some circumstances, of which we shall speak in the\r\nsequel, seem to justify the supposition of a very early cultivation of\r\nthe language.\r\n\r\nAll the knowledge we have respecting the ancient history of the Slavic\r\nrace, as we have seen, is gathered from foreign authors; the earliest\r\nof their own historians did not write before the second half of the\r\neleventh century.[6] At this time the Slavic nations were already in\r\npossession, partly as masters, partly as servants, of the whole vast\r\nextent of territory, which they now occupy; and if we assume that at\r\nthe present time about seventy or eighty millions speak the Slavic\r\nlanguage in its different dialects, we must calculate that at the\r\nabove mentioned period, and in the course of the next following\r\ncenturies, before the Slavic was by degrees supplanted in the\r\nGerman-Slavic provinces by the German idiom, the number of those who\r\ncalled that language their mother tongue was at least the fifth part\r\ngreater. Schlözer observes, that, with the exception of the Arabians,\r\nno nation on the globe had extended themselves so far. In the South,\r\nthe Adriatic, the range of the Balkan, and the Euxine, are their\r\nfrontiers; the coasts of the Icy Ocean are their limits in the North;\r\ntheir still greater extent in an Eastern and Western direction reaches\r\nfrom Kamtschatka and the Russian islands of the Pacific, where many of\r\ntheir vestiges are to be found among scattered tribes, as far as to\r\nthe Baltic and along the banks of the rivers Elbe, Muhr, and Raab,\r\nagain to the Adriatic. It is this immense extent, which adds greatly\r\nto the difficulties of a general survey of the different relations and\r\nconnections of nations, broken up into so many parts. The _history of\r\nthe language_ is our object, not the history of the people; we\r\ntherefore give of statistic and political notices only so much, as\r\nseems to be requisite for the illustration of our subject.\r\n\r\nThe earliest data for the history of the civilization of the Slavic\r\nrace, we find in their mythology; and here their oriental origin\r\nagain appears. The antithesis of a good and evil principle is met with\r\namong most of their tribes; and as even at the present time in some\r\nSlavic dialects every thing good, beautiful, praiseworthy, is to them\r\nsynonymous with the purity of the white colour, they call the good\r\nSpirit _Bielo Bòg_, the white god; the evil Spirit _Tcherno Bôg_, the\r\nblack god. The _Div_ of the old Russians seem to be likewise akin to\r\nthe _Dev_ of the Hindoo; the goddess of life, _Shiva_, of the Polabae,\r\nto the Indian _Shiva_; as the names of the Slavic personification of\r\ndeath, _Morjana_, _Morena_, _Marzana_, evidently stand in connection\r\nwith the Indian word for death, _Marana_. Strabo describes some of the\r\nidols of the Rugians, in which we meet again the whole significant\r\nsymbolization of the East. The custom prevalent among many Slavic\r\nnations, of females burning themselves with the corpses of their\r\nhusbands, seems also to have been brought from India to Europe.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other features of their mythology which belong to\r\nthem exclusively, and which remind us rather of the sprightly and\r\npoetical imagination of the Greeks. We allude to their mode of\r\nattributing life to the inanimate objects of nature, rocks, brooks and\r\ntrees; of peopling with supernatural beings the woods which surrounded\r\nthem, the mountains between which they lived. The _Rusalki_ of the\r\nRussians, the _Vila_ of the southern Slavic nations, the _Leshie_ of\r\nseveral other tribes, nymphs, naiads, and satyrs, are still to be\r\nfound in many popular tales and songs. If, however, we have compared\r\nthem to the poetical gods of the Greeks, we must not forget to add,\r\nthat their character has less resemblance to these gods, (who indeed\r\nappear only as ordinary men with higher powers, more violent passions,\r\nand less limited lives.) than it has to the northern Elf; and the\r\nGerman Nix and mountain Spirit--without heart and soul themselves, but\r\nalways intermeddling with intrusive curiosity in human affairs,\r\nhowever void of real interest in them; revengeful towards the most\r\ntrifling offence or the least neglect; and beneficent only to\r\nfavourites arbitrarily chosen.[7]\r\n\r\nThe earliest historians mention the Slavi as divided into several\r\ntribes and as speaking different dialects. There are no very ancient\r\nremains of their language, except those words or phrases, which\r\nwe find scattered through the works of foreign writers; and these\r\nmostly perverted by their want of knowledge. Besides these we have\r\nthe names of places, of festivals, partly still existing, and of some\r\ndignitaries, _Knes_, _Zupan_, etc. There are, indeed, among the\r\npopular songs of the Bohemians, Servians, Russians, and several other\r\ntribes, many which are evidently derived from the pagan period; but as\r\nthey have been preserved only by tradition, we must of course assume,\r\nthat their diction, has been changed almost in the same proportion as\r\nthe language of common life. Hence, national songs, before they have\r\nbeen fixed by letters, are always to be considered as much safer\r\nproofs for the genius than for the language of a people.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, probable that at least _one_ Slavic idiom was\r\ncultivated to a certain degree in very ancient times; for from the\r\nsingle circumstance, that Cyril's translation of the Bible, written in\r\nthe middle of the ninth century, bears the stamp of uncommon\r\nperfection in its forms, and of great copiousness, it is sufficiently\r\nevident, that the language must have been the means of expression for\r\nthinking men several centuries before. There is, indeed, no doubt that\r\nthe state of the language, as it appears in that translation, required\r\nno short interval of preparation.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts to convert portions of the Slavic race to\r\nChristianity were probably made before the seventh century; but it was\r\nonly at the beginning of the ninth that their partial success became\r\nof importance to their language and literature. It is true, that by\r\nthe last investigations of the late great Slavist, B. Kopitar, the\r\nfact has been ascertained, that a portion of the Slavic race was\r\nalready in possession of an alphabet _before_ Cyril;[8] but as this\r\nfact appears to have had no further result, we must still consider the\r\nninth century and Cyril's translation of the Gospels as the beginning\r\nof their literary history, the dawn at least of a brighter day.\r\n\r\nBefore we enter upon our examination of the different branches, we\r\nmust not neglect to direct the attention of the reader to the whole\r\ngreat trunk, which in the most ancient times appears to have ramified\r\ninto two principal stems.\r\n\r\nA boundless confusion indeed reigns in the classification of the\r\nSlavic nations among the earlier historians and philologists. It was\r\nthe learned Dobrovsky of Prague, who first brought light into this\r\nchaos, and established a classification, founded on a deep and\r\nthorough examination of all the different dialects, and acknowledged\r\nby the equally great authority of Kopitar. Adelung, in his\r\nMithridates,[9] has adopted it. The specific names, however, Antes and\r\nSlavi, which Adelung applies to the great divisions, and which were\r\nfirst used by Jornandes, are arbitrary, and less distinct than those\r\nadopted by Dobrovsky, Kopitar, and Schaffarik; who divide all Slavic\r\nnations, according to certain philological affinities and differences,\r\ninto the _North-Western_ and _South-Eastern_ Stems.[10]\r\n\r\nFar better would have been the terms 'Northern _and_ Western,'\r\n'Southern _and_ Eastern,' divisions; which indeed can be the only\r\nproper meaning of those appellations. The Slovaks in Hungary, for\r\ninstance, who belong to the first division, can in no way be called a\r\n_North_-Western people; and the Russians, who belong to the second,\r\nstill less a _South_-Eastern nation. The _origin_ from the South is\r\ncommon to all the Slavic tribes; hence the appellation of Northern and\r\nSouthern can be applied to them only in a relative sense; and that\r\nportion of the Slavic race, which inhabits Russia, is not known to\r\nhave ever lived in a more southern region than their Bohemian\r\nbrethren. We adopt, therefore, the division of the Slavi into EASTERN\r\nand WESTERN Stems; which seems indeed to be the only strictly proper\r\none.[11]\r\n\r\nThe following enumeration of the still existing distinct nations of\r\nthe Slavic race, may serve to give a clearer view of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. EASTERN STEM.\r\n\r\nI. RUSSIAN BRANCH.\r\n\r\n1. RUSSIANS. The Russians of Slavic origin form the bulk of the\r\npopulation of the European part of Russia. All the middle provinces of\r\nthis vast empire are occupied almost exclusively by a people of purely\r\nSlavic extraction. The numerous Slavi who are scattered through\r\nAsiatic Russia, are of the same race. They belong to the Greek\r\nChurch. To ascertain the exact numbers of the different races of one\r\nand the same nation, is exceedingly difficult. The statistical tables\r\nof the government afford little help; since it is the policy of the\r\nlatter to annihilate as much as possible the difference of races.\r\nSchaffarik, in his Slavic Ethnography, gives the number of the\r\nRussians proper at 38,400,000. We follow him, as the most diligent and\r\nmost consistent investigator of this matter; but we also feel bound to\r\nremark, that his statistical assertions have occasioned surprise, and\r\nmet with contradiction.\r\n\r\n2. RUSSNIAKS or RUTHENIANS, also called _Russinians_ and\r\n_Malo-Russians_. These are found in Malo-Russia, the South of Poland,\r\nGalicia, Ludomeria or Red Russia, the Bukovina, also in the\r\nnorth-eastern part of Hungary, and scattered over Walachia and\r\nMoldavia. The Kozaks, especially the Zaporogueans, belong chiefly to\r\nthis race; while the Kozaks of the Don are more mixed with pure\r\nRussians. Their number is given at more than thirteen millions. They\r\nall belong to the Oriental Church; though a portion of them are\r\nGreek-Catholics, or adherents of the United Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ILLYRICO-SERVIAN BRANCH.\r\n\r\n1. The ILLYRICO-SERVIANS proper, frequently called _Rascians_ or\r\n_Raitzi_, comprising five subdivisions.\r\n\r\na) The SERVIANS in Servia, lying between the rivers Timock, Drina,\r\nSave, the Danube, and the Balkan mountains; and, as a Turkish\r\nprovince, called Serf Vilayeti. Their number is at least a million. In\r\nearlier times, and especially at the end of the seventeenth century,\r\nmany of them emigrated to Hungary; where even now between three and\r\nfour hundred thousand of them are settled; exclusive of their near\r\nrelatives, the Slavonians, in the kingdom of Slavonia so called.\r\n\r\nb) BOSNIANS, between Dalmatia, the Balkan mountains, and the rivers\r\nDrina, Verbas, and Save; from four to five hundred thousand in number.\r\nMost of them belong, like their brethren the Servians, to the Greek\r\nChurch; about 100,000 are Roman Catholics. There are of late many\r\nMuhammedans among them, who still retain their language and most of\r\ntheir Slavic customs.\r\n\r\nc) MONTENEGRINS (Czernogortzi). The national name of the Montenegrins,\r\nhere given as _Czernogortzi_, is better written _Tzernogortzi_; see p.\r\n119, n. 17. Their number is given by Sir J.G. Wilkinson at 80,000, or\r\nmore. These are the Slavic inhabitants of the Turkish province\r\nAlbania, among the mountains of Montenegro. They have spread\r\nthemselves from Bosnia to the sea-coast as far as Antivari. This\r\nremarkable people the Turks never have been able to subjugate\r\ncompletely. They enjoy a sort of military-republican freedom: their\r\nhead chief being a Bishop with very limited power. They amount to\r\nnearly 60,000 souls, belonging to the Eastern Church.\r\n\r\nd) SLAVONIANS. These are the inhabitants of the Austrian kingdom of\r\nSlavonia and the duchy of Syrmia, between Hungary on the north and\r\nBosnia in the south, about half a million in number. A small majority\r\nbelongs to the Romish Church; the rest to the Greek Church.\r\n\r\ne) DALMATIANS. The country along the Adriatic, between Croatia and\r\nAlbania, together with the adjacent islands, is called the kingdom of\r\nDalmatia, and belongs likewise to the Austrian empire. It has,\r\ntogether with the Istrian shore north of it, towards 600,000\r\ninhabitants; of whom 500,000 belong to the Slavo-Servian race. They\r\nare all Roman Catholics; with the exception of about 80,000 who belong\r\nto the Greek Church.\r\n\r\n2. The Austrian kingdom of CROATIA in our time, between Styria,\r\nHungary, Slavonia, Bosnia, Dalmatia, and the Adriatic, is not the\r\nancient Croatia of Constantine Porphyrogenitus. Together with the\r\nCroatian colonists in Hungary, and the inhabitants of the Turkish\r\nSandshak Banialouka, it contains about 800,000 souls. Of these less\r\nthan 200,000 belong to the Greek Church; the great majority are\r\nCatholics. We shall see further on that the Croats are divided in\r\nrespect to their language into two parts: one of them having affinity\r\nwith the Servians and Dalmatians, the other with the Slovenzi of\r\nCarniola and Carinthia.\r\n\r\n3. SLOVENZI or VINDES. These names comprise the Slavic inhabitants of\r\nthe duchies of Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola, (the two latter\r\nforming the kingdom of Illyria,) and also those of the banks of the\r\nrivers Raab and Muhr in Hungary. Their number is over one million.\r\nWith the exception of a few Protestants, they are all Catholics. They\r\ncall themselves _Slovenzi_; but are known by foreign writers under the\r\nname of _Vindes_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. BULGARIAN BRANCH\r\n\r\nThe BULGARIANS occupy the Turkish province Sofia Vilayeti, between the\r\nDanube, the Euxine, the Balkan, and Servia; they are about three and a\r\nhalf millions in number, the remnant of a great nation. About 80,000\r\nmore are scattered through Bessarabia and the other provinces of South\r\nRussia. Schaffarik enumerates seven thousand as Austrian subjects,\r\nliving in that great receptacle of nations, Hungary. Most of them\r\nbelong to the Greek Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. WESTERN STEM.\r\n\r\nI. CZEKHO-SLOVAKIAN BRANCH.\r\n\r\n1. BOHEMIANS and MORAVIANS (Czekhes). These are the Slavic inhabitants\r\nof the kingdom of Bohemia and the Margravate of Moravia, both\r\nbelonging to the Austrian empire. They are about four and a half\r\nmillions in number; of whom 100,000 are Protestants, the rest\r\nCatholics. Schaffarik includes also 44,000 of the Slavic inhabitants\r\nof Prussian Silesia in this race.\r\n\r\n2. SLOVAKS. Almost all the northern part of Hungary is inhabited by\r\nSlovaks: besides this they are scattered through the whole of that\r\ncountry, and speak different dialects. They are reckoned at between\r\ntwo and three millions.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. POLISH OR LEKHIAN BRANCH.\r\n\r\nThis comprises the inhabitants of the present kingdom of Poland; of a\r\npart of what are called since 1772 the Russian-Polish provinces; of\r\nthe duchy of Posen; and of Galicia and Ludomeria. The bulk of the\r\npeople in this latter country are Russniaks or Ruthenians. In the\r\nRussian provinces, which were formerly called White Russia, Black\r\nRussia, and Red Russia, and were conquered by the Poles in former\r\ntimes, the peasantry are Russians and Russniaks; in Lithuania, they\r\nare Lithuanians or Lettones, a race of a different family of nations.\r\nIn all these countries, only the nobility and inhabitants of the\r\ncities are really Poles, or Slavi of the Leckian race. To the same\r\nrace belongs also the Polish population of Silesia, and an isolated\r\ntribe in the Prussian province of Pomerania, called the Kassubes. The\r\nSlavi of the Leckian race hardly amount to the number of ten millions;\r\nall Catholics, with the exception of about half a million of\r\nProtestants.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SORABIAN-VENDISH BRANCH.\r\n\r\nThere are remnants of the old Sorabæ; and several other Slavic races\r\nin Lusatia and some parts of Brandenburg. Their number is less than\r\n2,000,000; divided between Protestants and Catholics.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, that besides the races here enumerated, there are\r\nSlavic tribes scattered through Germany, Transylvania, Moldavia, and\r\nWalachia, nay, through the whole of Turkey. Thus, for instance, the\r\nTchaconic dialect, spoken in the eastern part of ancient Sparta and\r\nunintelligible to the other Greeks, has been proved by one of the most\r\ndistinguished philologists to have been of Slavic origin.[12] But to\r\nascertain their number, at any rate very small, would be a matter of\r\nimpossibility, and in every respect of little consequence.\r\n\r\nWe thus distinguish among the nations of the Slavic race two great\r\nfamilies, the connection of whose members among each other is entirely\r\nindependent of their present geographical situation; and this division\r\nrests upon a marked distinction in the Slavic language. To specify the\r\nmarks, by which the philologist recognizes to which of these families\r\neach nation belongs, seems to be here out of place. The reader,\r\nwithout knowing the language itself, would hardly be able to\r\ncomprehend them sufficiently; and he who understands it, will find\r\nbetter sources of information in philological works. All that concerns\r\nus here, is the general character, the genius of the language. For\r\nthis purpose we will try to give in a few words a general outline of\r\nits grammar; exhibiting principally those features, which, as being\r\ncommon to all or most of its different dialects, seem to be the best\r\nadapted to express its general character.\r\n\r\nThe analogy between the Slavic and the Sanscrit languages consists\r\nindeed only in the similar sound of a great many words; the\r\nconstruction of the former is purely European, and it has in this\r\nrespect a nearer relation to the Greek, Latin, and German; with which\r\nidioms it has evidently been derived from the same source.[13] The\r\nSlavic has three genders. Like the Latin, it knows no article; at\r\nleast not the genuine Slavic; for those dialects which have lost their\r\nnational character, like the Bulgarian, or those which have been\r\ncorrupted by the influence of the German,[14] employ the demonstrative\r\npronoun as an article; and the Bulgarian has borrowed the Albanian\r\nmode of suffixing one to the noun. For this very reason the\r\ndeclensions are more perfect in Slavic than in German and Greek; for\r\nthe different cases, as in Latin, are distinguished by suffixed\r\nsyllables or endings. The Singular has seven cases; the Plural only\r\nsix, the vocative having always the form of the nominative. As for the\r\nDual, a form which the Slavic languages do not all possess, the\r\nnominative and accusative, the genitive and local; the dative and\r\ninstrumental cases, are always alike.\r\n\r\nFor the declensions of adjectives the Slavic has two principal forms,\r\naccording as they are _definite_ or _indefinite_. The Old or Church\r\nSlavonic knows only two degrees of comparison, the positive and\r\ncomparative; it has no superlative, or rather it has the same form for\r\nthe comparative and superlative. This is regularly made by the suffix\r\n_ii_. mostly united with one of those numerous sibilants, for which\r\nthe English language has hardly letters or signs, _sh, tsh, sht,\r\nshtsh_, etc. In the more modern dialects this deficiency has been\r\nsupplied; in most of them a superlative form is made by prefixing the\r\nparticle _naï_; e.g. in Servian, _mudar_, wise, _mudrii_ wiser,\r\n_naïmudrii_, the wisest. The Russian, besides this and several other\r\nsuperlative forms, has one that is more perfect, as proceeding from\r\nthe adjective itself: _doroghii_ dear, _doroshe_ dearer,\r\n_doroshaïshii_, dearest. Equally rich is this language in augmentative\r\nand diminutive forms not only of the substantive but also of the\r\nadjective, a perfection in which even the Italian can hardly be\r\ncompared to it; of which however all the Slavic dialects possess more\r\nor less. Almost all the Russian substantives have two augmentatives\r\nand three diminutives; some have even more. We abstain with some\r\ndifficulty from adducing examples; but we are afraid of going beyond\r\nour limits. It deserves to be mentioned as a peculiarity, that the\r\nSlavi consider only the first four ordinal numbers as adjectives, and\r\nall the following ones as substantives. For this reason, the governed\r\nword must stand in the genitive instead of the accusative: _osm sot_\r\n(nom. _sto_), eight hundred. In all negative phrases they employ\r\nlikewise the genitive instead of the accusative. A double negation\r\noccurs in Slavic frequently, without indicating an affirmation; for\r\neven if another negation has already taken place, they are accustomed\r\nto prefix to the verb the negative particle _ne_ or _nje_.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the verb, it is difficult to give a general idea of its\r\ncharacter; for it is in the forms of this part of speech, that there\r\nreigns the greatest variety in the numerous dialects of the Slavic\r\nlanguage. The same termination which in Old Slavonic and in Russian\r\nindicates invariably the first person of the present, _u_ or _gu_, is\r\nin Servian that of the third person Plural of the present and\r\nimperfect; and the general termination of the Servian and the Polish\r\nfor the first person of the present, _am, em_ or _im_, is in Old\r\nSlavonic and Russian used for the Plural, _em_ and _im_. There is\r\nhowever one fundamental form through all the Slavic dialects for the\r\nsecond person of the present, a termination in _ash, esh_ or _ish_;\r\nand this is consequently the person, by which it is to be recognized\r\nto what conjugation a verb belongs.\r\n\r\nThe division of the verbs adopted in all other European languages into\r\n_Active_ and _Passive_, seems to be useless in Slavic; for their being\r\nactive or passive has no influence upon their flexion; and the forms\r\nof the Latin Passive and Deponent must in Slavic be expressed by a\r\ncircumlocution. A division of more importance and springing from the\r\npeculiarity of the language itself, is that into verbs _Perfect_ and\r\n_Imperfect_. Neither the Greek, nor the Latin, nor the German, nor any\r\nof the languages derived from them, admits of a similar distinction.\r\nIt seems therefore difficult for persons not perfectly acquainted with\r\nany Slavic dialect, to form to themselves a clear idea of it. It is\r\nhowever one of their most striking features, which adds very\r\nconsiderably to their general richness and power. The relation in\r\nwhich the perfect and imperfect verbs stand to each other, is about\r\nthe same as that of the perfect and imperfect tenses in the\r\nconjugation of the Latin verb. Perfect verbs express that an action\r\ntakes place a single time, and therefore is entirely completed and\r\npast; from their very nature it results, that they have no imperfect\r\ntense, and their conjugation must be in general incomplete. Imperfect\r\nverbs express that the same action continues. Both have in most cases\r\nthe same radical syllable, and may be formed with a certain degree of\r\nfreedom; thus in Servian, _viknuti_, to cry once, _vikati_, to be\r\ncrying; _umriyeti_, to die, _umirati_, to be dying. There are however\r\nothers, which stand in the same relation to each other without issuing\r\nfrom the same verbal stock; e.g. in Servian, _tchuti_ and _sluskati_,\r\nto hear; _retji_ and _govoriti_, to speak, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Polish language, which is remarkably rich in every kind of\r\nflexion, has a still simpler and more regular way of forming also a\r\nfrequentative out of almost every verb; e.g. _czytam_, I read,\r\n_czytivam_, I read often; _biore_, take, _bieram_, I take often, etc.\r\nIn Bohemian, which in respect to grammar is by far the most cultivated\r\nof the Slavic languages, there is a refinement in the tenses, of which\r\neven the most perfect knowledge of the classical languages gives\r\nhardly any idea, and the right use of which is seldom, if ever,\r\nacquired by foreigners. Duration, decision, repetition, all the\r\ndifferent shades of time and purpose, which other languages have to\r\ncircumscribe in long phrases, the Bohemian expresses by a slight\r\nalteration of one or two syllables.\r\n\r\nNot less rich in these variations of the verb is the Russian. Besides\r\na vast treasure of original, genuine _indefinite_ verbs, as they call\r\nall those, which have the general character of the verb of other\r\nlanguages, without any allusion to the duration or continuance of the\r\naction, they have verbs _simple, frequentative_ and _perfect_. A\r\nsingle example will illustrate the fact:\r\n\r\nVerb indefinite, _dvigat'_,[15] to move.\r\n\r\nVerb simple, _dvinut'_, to move a single time.\r\n\r\nVerb frequentative, _dvigivat'_, to move repeatedly.[16]\r\n\r\nVerb perfect, _sdvigat'_, to move completely.\r\n\r\nThe reader may judge for himself, of what precision, compactness, and\r\nenergy, a language is capable, which has so little need of\r\ncircumlocution. It must be mentioned, however, that not all these\r\nverbs are complete; as indeed it is obvious from their very nature,\r\nthat in many of them, various tenses must be wanting. It is probably\r\nfor this reason, that some of the most distinguished grammarians do\r\nnot acknowledge this division of the verb itself; but put all its\r\nvariations under the conjugation of a single verb, as different\r\ntenses,--a proceeding which contributes much to make the Slavic\r\ngrammar a horror to all foreigners.\r\n\r\nIf this short and meagre sketch is hardly sufficient to give the\r\nreader an idea of the richness, precision, and general perfectibility\r\nof the Slavic languages, it will be still more difficult to reconcile\r\nhis mind to their _sound_; against which the most decided prejudices\r\nexist among all foreigners. The old Slavic alphabet has forty-six\r\nletters; and from this variety it can justly be concluded, that the\r\nlanguage had originally at least nearly as many different sounds,\r\nalthough a great part of them are no longer to be found in the modern\r\nSlavic languages. It is true, that all the dialects are comparatively\r\npoor in vowels, and, like the oriental languages; utterly deficient\r\nin diphthongs.[17] They have neither the _oe_ nor _ue_, which the\r\nGermans consider as the best sounds of their idiom: nor the\r\nGreek,[Greek: ei], [Greek: ui], [Greek: au], [Greek: eu], and the\r\nlike; still less the variety of pronunciation of one and the same\r\nvowel, peculiar to the English. The Poles, Russians, and Bohemians,\r\npossess however a twofold _i_, [18] a finer and a coarser one; the\r\nlatter of which is not to be found in any other European language, and\r\nis unpleasant to the ear of foreigners. The Poles, besides this, have\r\n_nasal vowels_, as other languages have nasal consonants.[19]\r\n\r\nIt is a striking peculiarity, that Slavic words very seldom _begin_\r\nwith a pure _a_,[20] hardly ever with _e_.[21] There are in the whole\r\nRussian language, only two words of Slavic origin, which have an\r\ninitial _e_, and about twenty foreign ones in which this letter has\r\nbeen preserved in its purity; in all the rest the _e_ is introduced by\r\n_y_; e.g. _Yelisaveta_, Elizabeth; _yest_', Lat. _est_, it is;\r\n_Yepiscop, episcopus_, bishop; _yeress_, heresy, etc. The initial _a_\r\nis more frequent, and is especially preserved in most foreign proper\r\nnames, e.g. Alexander, Anna; or in other foreign words, where they\r\nomit the _H_, as _Ad_, Hades, Hell, _Alleluya_, Hallelujah. But the\r\nnatural tendency of the language is to introduce it likewise by _y_;\r\nthus they say _yagnya_, in preference to _agnya_, Lat. _agnus_,\r\nalthough this last also is to be found in the old church books:\r\n_yasti_, to eat, _yakor_ anchor, _yavor_, maple, German _ahorn_.[22]\r\nThe _o_ in the beginning of words is pure in most Slavic dialects,\r\ni.e. without a preceding consonant. In Russian it sounds frequently\r\nmore like an _a_ than an _o_; e.g. _adin_, one, instead of _odin;\r\natiotz_, father, instead of _otetz_. But the Vendes of Lusatia\r\npronounce it _vo_; as also the Bohemians in the language of common\r\nlife; although in higher style they have a pure initial _o_. The\r\nCroats, on the other hand, have no pure initial _u_; they say _vuho_\r\near, instead _uho_ or _ucho_.\r\n\r\nAs to consonants, there is a great variety in the Slavic languages.\r\nThere is however no _f_ to be found in any genuine Slavic word; and\r\neven in words adopted from foreign languages, this letter has\r\nfrequently changed its sound. So the Bohemian has made _barwa_ from\r\nthe German _farbe_, color. In respect to the connection of the Slavic\r\nwith the Latin, it is interesting to compare _bob_ with _feba, bodu_\r\nwith _fodio, vru_ with _ferveo, peru_ with _ferio, plamen_, with\r\n_flamma, pishozala_ with _fistula_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe greatest variety among the Slavic letters exists in the sibilants.\r\nOf these there are seven, perfectly distinct from each other; some of\r\nwhich it would be difficult to denote by English characters[23]. They\r\nare the favourite sounds of the language. Not only the guttural\r\nsounds, _g, ch,_ and _k_, but also _d_ and _t_, are changed in many\r\ncases into analogous sibilants, according to fixed and very simple\r\nrules. On the other hand, the Slavic nations have a way of softening\r\nthe harshness of the consonants, peculiar in that extent to them\r\nalone. The Frenchman has his _l mouillé,_ the Spaniard his _elle\r\ndoblado_ and _ñ_. the Portuguese his _lh_ and _nh_; the Slavic nations\r\npossess the same softening sound for almost all their consonants. Such\r\nis the usual termination of the Russian verb in _at'_ or _it'_, etc.\r\nwhere other Slavic nations say _ati_ or _iti_ or those of the western\r\nbranch _acz_ or _ecz_. In the same manner it occurs after initial\r\nconsonants; thus _mjaso_, meat; _bjel_, white; _ljbov_, love, etc.\r\n\r\nThe letters _l_ and _r_ have in all Slavic languages the value of\r\nvowels; words like _twrdy_, _wjtr_, which judging from their\r\nappearance a foreigner would despair of ever being able to pronounce,\r\nare always in metre used as words of two syllables. Thus _Wlk_, _Srp_,\r\nare not harsher than _Wolk_ and _Serp_. We feel however that these\r\nexamples cannot serve to refute the existing prejudices against the\r\neuphony of the Slavic languages. Instead of ourselves, let one of\r\ntheir most eloquent and warmest advocates defend them against the\r\nreproach of roughness and harshness.[24] \"Euphony and feminine\r\nsoftness of a language are two very different things. It is true that\r\nin most of the Slavic dialects, with the exception of the Servian, the\r\nconsonants are predominant; but if we consider a language in a\r\nphilosophical point of view, the consonants, as being the signs of\r\nideas, and the vowels, as being mere bearers in the service of the\r\nconsonants, appear in a quite different light. The more consonants,\r\nthe richer is a language in ideas. _Exempla sunt in promtu_. The\r\neuphony of single syllables is only partial and relative; but the\r\nharmony of a whole language depends on the euphonic sound of periods,\r\nwords, syllables, and single letters. What language possesses these\r\nfour elements of harmony in equal measure? Too many vowels sound just\r\nas unpleasantly as too many consonants; a suitable number and\r\ninterchange of both is requisite to produce true harmony. Even harsh\r\nsyllables belong to the necessary qualities of a language; for nature\r\nherself has harsh sounds, which the poet would be unable to paint\r\nwithout harsh sounding tones. The roughness of the Slavic idioms, of\r\nwhich foreigners have complained so frequently, is therefore\r\nexclusively to be ascribed to the awkwardness of inexperienced or\r\ntasteless writers; or they are ridiculous mistakes of the reader, who,\r\nunacquainted with the language, receives the sounds with his eyes\r\ninstead of his ears.\"--\"The pure and distinct vocalization, which does\r\nnot leave it to the arbitrary choice of the speaker to pronounce\r\ncertain vowels or to pass them over, as is the case in German. French,\r\nand English, gives at the same time to the Slavic languages the\r\nadvantage of a regular quantity of their syllables, as in Greek; which\r\nmakes them better adapted than any other for imitating the old classic\r\nmetres. We must confess, however, that this matter has been hitherto\r\nneglected in most of them, or has been treated with little\r\nintelligence. We mean to say: Each Slavic syllable is by its very\r\nnature either short or long; since each Slavic vowel has a twofold\r\nduration, both short and long. This natural shortening and lengthening\r\nof a syllable is, as with the Greeks, entirely independent of the\r\ngrammatical stress or falling of the voice upon them, or in other\r\nwords, of the _prosodic tone_; the _quantity_ being founded on the\r\nnature of the pronunciation, on the longer or shorter duration of the\r\nvowel itself, and not on the grammatical accent. This latter may lie\r\njust as well on syllables prosodically short, as on those which are\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these introductory remarks, we turn again to the historical part\r\nof our essay, referring the reader back to our division of the whole\r\nSlavic race into Eastern and Western Stems. We have, first of all,\r\nthat most remarkable Old or Church Slavonic, the language of their\r\nBible, now no longer a living tongue, but still the inexhaustible\r\nsource of the sublimest and holiest expressions for its younger\r\nsisters. Then follow the _four_ languages, perfectly distinct from\r\neach other, spoken by the Eastern Slavic nations, viz. the Russian,\r\nIllyrico-Servian, Vindish, and Bulgarian. Three of them possess a\r\nliterature of their own; and one of them, the Illyrico-Servian, even a\r\ndouble literature; for political circumstances and the influence of\r\nthe early division of the oriental and occidental churches, having\r\nunfortunately split the nation into two parts, caused them also to\r\nadopt two different methods of writing one and the same language, as\r\nwe shall show in the sequel. And lastly, among the Slavic nations of\r\nthe Western stem, we find either _three_ or _four_ different\r\nlanguages, according as we regard the Czekhish and Slovakian idioms as\r\nessentially the same or distinct, viz. the Bohemian, [Slovakian,]\r\nPolish, and Sorabic in Lusatia. Of these, the first and third have\r\neach an extensive literature of its own.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Schlegel's _Sprache und Weisheit der Indier_,\r\nHeidelb. 1808.

But as\r\nevery connecting link between them and the _historical_ Slavi is\r\nwanting, the fact seems of little importance.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Schaffarik in his work on _Slavic Antiquities_ attempts\r\nto prove that the Sarmatae were no Slavi, but a Perso-Median nation;\r\nremnants of which, he thinks, he has discovered in the Alanes and\r\nOsetenzes in the Caucasus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The name of the _Slavi_ has generally been derived from\r\n_slava_, glory, and their national feelings have of course been\r\ngratified by this derivation. But the more immediate origin of the\r\nappellation, is to be sought in the word _slovo_ word, speech. The\r\nchange of _o_ into _a_ occurs frequently in the Slavic languages,\r\n(thus _slava_ comes from _slovo_) but is in this case probably to be\r\nascribed to foreigners, viz. Byzantines, Romans, and Germans. In the\r\nlanguage of the latter, the _o_ in names and words of Slavic origin\r\ninmany instances becomes _a_. The radical syllable _slov_ is still to\r\nbe found in the appellations which the majority of the Slavic nations\r\napply to themselves or kindred nations, e.g. Slovenzi, Slovaci,\r\nSlovane, Sloveni, etc. The Russians and Servians did not exchange the\r\n_o_ for _a_ before the seventh century. See Schaffarik's _Geschichte_,\r\np. 5. n. 6. The same writer observes, p. 287. n. 8, \"It is remarkable\r\nthat, while all the other Slavic nations relinquished their original\r\n_national_ names, and adopted _specific_ names, as Russians, Poles,\r\nSilesians, Czekhes, Moravians, Sorabians, Servians, Morlachians,\r\nCzernogortzi, Bulgarians; nay, when most of them imitating foreigners\r\naltered the general name _Slovene_ into _Slavene_, only those two\r\nSlavic branches, which touch each other on the banks of the Danube,\r\nthe _Slovaks_ and the _Slovenzi_, have retained in its purity their\r\noriginal national name.\"--According to Schaffarik's later opinion, as\r\nexpressed in his _Antiquities_, the appellation Slavi, Slaveni, or\r\nSlovenians, is derived from one of their seats, that is, the country\r\non the Upper Niemen, where the _Stloveni_ or _Sueveni_ of Ptolemy\r\nlived. It is said to be called by the Finns _Sallo_ (like every\r\nwoodland); by the Lithuanians, _Sallawa, Slawa_; in old Prussian,\r\n_Salava_; by the neighbouring Germans, _Schalauen_; in Latin,\r\n_Scalavia_. But it seems a more natural conclusion, that _vice versa_\r\nthe name of the district was rather derived from Slavic settlers\r\nliving in the midst of a German, Russian, and Finnish population--For\r\nthe derivation from _slovo_, word, speech, the circumstance seems to\r\nspeak, that in most Slavic languages the appellation for a German (and\r\nformerly for all foreigners) is _Njemetz_, i.e. one dumb, an impotent,\r\nnameless, speechless person. What more natural, in a primitive stage\r\nof culture, than to consider only those as speaking, who are\r\n_understood_; and those who seem to utter unmeaning sounds, as dumb,\r\nimpotent beings?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The earliest Slavic historian is the Russian monk Nestor,\r\nborn in the year 1056.

Dankovsky in his\r\nwork, _Die Griechen als Sprachverwandte der Slaven_, Presburg 1828,\r\ncontends that a knowledge of the Slavic language is of the highest\r\nimportance for the Greek scholar, as the only means by which he may be\r\nenabled to clear up obscure passages and to ascertain the\r\nsignification of doubtful words. Among the historical proofs, he\r\nfurnishes a vocabulary containing 306 Slavic and Greek words of\r\nstriking analogy. \"Of three sisters,\" he observes, \"_one_ kept\r\nfaithful to her mother tongue--the Slavic language; the _second_ gave\r\nto that common heritage the highest cultivation--the Greek language;\r\nand the _third_ mixed the mother tongue with a foreign idiom--the\r\nLatin language.\" A work of the same tendency has been published in the\r\nGreek language, by the Greek priest Constantine, Vienna 1828. It\r\ncontains a vocabulary of 800 pages of _Russian_ and Greek words,\r\ncorresponding in sound and meaning.--That these views are not new, is\r\ngenerally known; although they hardly ever have been carried so far,\r\nexcept perhaps by the author of the History of Russia, Levesque, who\r\nconsiders the Latins as a Slavic colony; or by Solarich, who derived\r\nall modern languages from the Slavic. Gelenius in his _Lexicon\r\nSymphonum_, 1557, made the first etymological attempt in respect to\r\nthe Slavic languages. In modern times, great attention has been paid\r\nto Slavic etymology by Dobrovsky, Linde, Adelung, Bantkje, Fritsch,\r\nand others. An _Etymologicon Universale_ was published in 1811, at\r\nCambridge in England, by W. Whiter.--Galiffec, in his _Italy and its\r\nInhabitants_, 1816 and 1817, started the opinion, that the _Russian_\r\nwas the original language, and that the Old Slavonic and all the rest\r\nwere only dialects.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Or rather some writers in Lusatia and the Austrian\r\nprovinces comprised in the kingdom of Illyria.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: The t' signifies the _Yehr_, or _soft sign_ of the\r\nRussians in addition to the _t_.

This seems however very early to have\r\nbeen broken up into several dialects; and such indeed must have been\r\nthe natural result of the wide extension of the people. Eginhard, the\r\nsecretary and historian of Charlemagne, (ob. 839.) calls the Slavic\r\nnations, whom his hero subjugated, Veletabæ, Sorabæ, Obotrites, and\r\nBohemians; and mentions expressly that they did not all speak the\r\nsame, but a very similar language. It would be difficult to decide\r\nwhat portion of the still existing Slavic tongue has kept itself the\r\npurest; the Old Slavic has its Græcisms, the Servian its Turcisms, the\r\nPolish and Bohemian their Germanisms, the Russian its Tartarisms,\r\nGermanisms, and Gallicisms. No language in the world will ever resist\r\nthe influence of the languages of its neighbours; and even the lofty\r\nChinese wall cannot protect the inhabitants of that vast empire from\r\ncorruptions in their language. It was formerly the general view, that\r\nthe ecclesiastical Slavonic was to be considered as the _mother_ of\r\nall the living Slavic dialects; and there are indeed even now a few\r\nphilologians and historians who still adhere to that opinion. The\r\ndeeper investigations of modern times, wherever an equal share of\r\nprofound erudition and love of truth has happened to be united in the\r\nsame persons, have sufficiently proved, that the church Slavonic is to\r\nbe considered, not as the mother of all the other Slavic languages,\r\nbut as standing to them only in the relation of an elder sister,--a\r\n_dialect_ like them, but earlier developed and cultivated. The\r\noriginal mother-tongue, from which they were all derived, must have\r\nperished many centuries ago. But _where_ the Old Slavic was once\r\nspoken, and which of the still living dialects has been developed\r\n_immediately_ out of it,--an honour to which all the nations of the\r\neastern stem, and one of the western, aspire,--is a question which all\r\nthe investigations and conclusions of able historians and philologians\r\nhave not hitherto been able to answer in a satisfactory manner. The\r\nhighest authorities in Slavic matters are divided on this point. The\r\ndisputes relating to it have been conducted with a degree of zeal,\r\nlittle proportioned to its intrinsic importance; nay, recently, with a\r\npassion bordering upon fierceness; and what is still more to be\r\nregretted, without that regard to truth and candour, which ought to be\r\nthe foundation of all historical researches. The great political\r\nquestions which in the East of Europe have already disturbed the peace\r\nof nations--the idea of Panslavism, the disputed preponderance of\r\nAustria or Russia, the jealousy of the Slavic races against the\r\nGermans and among each other--have been allowed to exert a decided\r\ninfluence even on this purely historical question.\r\n\r\nThe claims of the Russians in this matter have long since been given\r\nup as easily refuted; being indeed destitute of any historical\r\nfoundation. The circumstance, however, that the language of the Slavic\r\nBible was, in Russia, until the reign of Peter the Great, exclusively\r\nthe language of books, confirmed the natives for a long time in the\r\nbelief, that the old Russian and the church Slavic were one and the\r\nsame language; and that the modern Russian was the immediate\r\ndescendant of the latter; until modern criticism has better\r\nillustrated the whole subject.[1]\r\n\r\nThe great similarity of the _Slovakish_ language with the Old Slavic,\r\nespecially of the national dialect spoken by those Slovaks who live\r\nscattered through Hungary; and the correspondence of their grammatical\r\nforms and flexion, to a degree not found in any other Slavic language;\r\nseemed to decide for the Slovaks. An historical basis is likewise not\r\nwanting to this hypothesis; for the Slovaks belonged formerly to the\r\ngreat kingdom of Moravia; where, according to all the ancient\r\nhistorians, Cyril and Methodius lived and taught the longest.[2]\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the venerable Bohemian Abbot Dobrovsky, who has\r\nexamined the opinions of his predecessors with more exactness and\r\nerudition, and investigated the nature of the different Slavic\r\ndialects more deeply than any philologist before him, decides for the\r\n_Servians_. According to him, the Old Slavic was, in the time of Cyril\r\nand Methodius, the Servian-Bulgarian-Macedonian dialect, the language\r\nof the Slavi in Thessalonica, the birthplace of these two Slavic\r\napostles.[3]\r\n\r\nHis grounds seemed indeed incontestable, until Kopitar, a name of\r\nequally high authority and importance in Slavic matters, who formerly\r\nagreed with him,[4] proved in a later work,[5] by arguments of no\r\nless weight, that the true home of the language of the Slavic Bible\r\nwas to be sought among the _Pannonic_ or _Carantano-Slavi_, the\r\n_Slovenzi_ or _Vindes_ of the present times.[6] The adoption of a\r\nnumber of _German_ (not _Greek_) words for Christian ideas, as\r\n_tzerkwa_ Kirch, _post_ fast, _chrestiti_ christening, etc., can only\r\nbe explained, he asserts, by German neighbourhood and German\r\ninfluence. These Pannonian Slavi were Methodius' own diocesans; for\r\ntheir instruction the Scriptures were first translated, and only\r\ncarried by the two brethren, at a later period, to the Bulgarians and\r\nMoravians, who easily understood the kindred dialect.\r\n\r\nKopitar's arguments have hitherto failed to convince other eminent\r\nSlavic scholars, especially those of the Bohemian school; who still\r\naccept it as a fact, that the language of the Slavic Bible was, in the\r\nninth century, the Servian-Bulgarian dialect; and Bulgaria its home.\r\nSchaffarik, another great name in Slavic philological researches,\r\nseemed in an earlier work to adopt the opinion of Kopitar; but, after\r\ncontinuing his investigations further, he too came to the result, that\r\nBulgaria was the home of the Old Slavic; and that the language still\r\nspoken in that province, corrupted indeed by foreign influences more\r\nthan any other Slavic dialect, is its direct descendant.[7]\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the Old Slavic has long since become the common\r\nproperty of all the Slavic nations, and its treasures are for all of\r\nthem an inexhaustible mine. Dobrovsky counted in it 1605 radical\r\nsyllables.[8] Hence, it is not only rich in its present state, but has\r\nin itself the inestimable power of augmenting its richness, the\r\nfaculty of creating new forms of expression for new ideas. But its\r\ngreat perfection does not consist alone in this multiplicity of words.\r\nSchlözer, the great historian and linguist, justly observes: \"Among\r\nall modern languages the Slavonic (Old Slavic) is one of those which\r\nare most fully developed. With its richness and other perfections I\r\nhave here no concern. How it became so, the history of its cultivation\r\nsufficiently explains. Its model was the Greek language, in those days\r\nthe most cultivated in the world; although Cedrenus no longer wrote\r\nlike Xenophon. No idiom was more capable than the Slavonic of adopting\r\nthe beauties of the Greek. The translators, intending a literal\r\nversion, and not like Cædmon the Anglo-Saxon, or Otfried the German, a\r\nmere _poetic metaphrase_, were in a certain measure compelled to\r\n_subdue_ their own language, to make it flexible, to invent new turns,\r\nin order faithfully to imitate the original.\" [9]\r\n\r\nAfter having ceased for centuries to be a language of common life, the\r\nOld Slavic has of course lost that kind of pliancy and facility, which\r\nonly a living language, employed to express all the daily wants of\r\nmen, can possibly acquire. But for this same reason it has gained\r\ninfinitely in solemnity and dignity. Imposing by its very sound,\r\nexciting in the minds of millions sanctifying religious associations,\r\nit seems to have grown almost unfit for any vulgar use, and to have\r\nbecome exclusively devoted to holy, or at least to serious and\r\ndignified subjects.\r\n\r\nThere are, as we have mentioned above, many circumstances, which seem\r\nto justify the opinion, that the Slavi were very early in possession\r\nof a degree of cultivation, which would make it indeed difficult to\r\nbelieve, that they should not have known how to read and write before\r\nthe ninth century. Ditmar of Merseburg, the German, speaks of the\r\ninscriptions with which the pagan Obotrites, the Slavic inhabitants of\r\nMecklenburg, used to cover their idols. The southern Slavi had much\r\ngreater advantages. Neighbours of the Greeks, and in constant\r\nintercourse with them; both as a nation, by war and traffic, and\r\nthrough individuals who lived at the court of Constantinople; it can\r\nhardly be supposed, that no earlier attempt should have been made to\r\nadapt the Greek alphabet to the Slavic language, or to invent a new\r\none founded on that basis. There was however not a single\r\n_satisfactory_ proof, that this was ever done with any degree of\r\nsuccess before that time; notwithstanding all the grounds by which\r\nsome modern writers, zealous and eloquent advocates of this opinion,\r\nendeavoured to support it.[10] It is only since Kopitar's discovery of\r\nsome Glagolitic manuscripts _at least_ cotemporary with the most\r\nancient Cyrillic documents known, that this question has taken another\r\naspect. But whether there existed already a Slavic alphabet or not, it\r\nis very doubtful whether Cyril knew it; since the Slavic tribes among\r\nwhom he and Methodius lived, were not acquainted with it; for all the\r\nlegends and early historical annals agree in calling Cyril the\r\ninventor of the Slavic alphabet.\r\n\r\nThis alphabet, as arranged by Cyril, is founded on the Greek. In\r\nadjusting it, Cyril employed all the Greek characters; although a few\r\nof them have so much altered their shape in the course of time, as\r\nhardly to be recognized in their present form, e.g. the _Z_ and the\r\n_H_ of the Greeks. The first has the English, not the Greek\r\npronunciation of that letter; the latter in its altered shape is the\r\ncommon _I_ of the Slavic language, and thus corresponds with the\r\npronunciation of the modern Greeks. The _H_ or _Eta_ in an unaltered\r\nform, on the other hand, is the _N_ of the Slavic alphabet. The Greek\r\n_B_, ß, went over into the still softer sound of _V_, _v_;[11] and\r\nanother sign was selected for Buki or _B_. This and all the characters\r\nto denote Slavic sounds, which he did not find in the Greek alphabet,\r\nCyril took from other oriental languages, wherever he could find\r\nsimilar sounds; and thus very judiciously avoided that accumulation of\r\nletters to mark a single sound, which occur so often in all the\r\nsystems of writing derived from the Latin. In this manner he extended\r\nhis alphabet to forty-six characters or signs; some of them indeed\r\nmerely signs for expressing shades of pronunciation, which in other\r\nlanguages are denoted by marks and points. Some others are not\r\npronounced at all, and seem, at least according to the present state\r\nof the Slavic languages, utterly superfluous. Hence the Russians and\r\nServians have diminished the number of their letters considerably;\r\nalthough the Russian has still some which could be amalgamated with\r\nothers, or entirely omitted. Whether the Old Slavic actually had, at\r\nthe time of Cyril's invention, so many different shades of sound, it\r\nwould be difficult to decide at present, after that language has\r\nexisted for so many centuries as a mere language of books.\r\n\r\nCyril, or, according to his baptismal name, Constantine, and Methodius\r\nhis brother, must be reckoned among the benefactors of mankind; for\r\nit was they who procured for the Slavic nations, so early as the ninth\r\ncentury, the inestimable privilege of reading the Holy Scriptures in a\r\nlanguage familiar to their ears and minds; whilst the sacred volume\r\nyet remained, for centuries after, inaccessible to all the other\r\nEuropean Christians, the exclusive property of the priesthood. They\r\nwere born in Thessalonica, in the early part of the ninth century, of\r\na noble family; it does not appear whether of Greek or of Slavic\r\nextraction. Macedonia, of which province Thessalonica was in the times\r\nof the Romans the capital, was inhabited by many Slavi at a very early\r\nperiod. Constantine, who obtained by his learning and abilities the\r\nsurname of the Philosopher, could have learned Slavic here, even\r\nwithout belonging to the Slavic nation. As a flourishing commercial\r\ncity, this place was peculiarly favourable for learning languages; and\r\nit was probably here too, that Constantine learned Armenian; for the\r\nintroduction of several Armenian letters into the Slavic alphabet\r\nseems to prove, that this language was not unknown to him. When grown\r\nup, his parents sent him to Byzantium, where he entered the clerical\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that there came ambassadors from the Khazares, a\r\nHunnic-Tartaric tribe, to the emperor Michael, to ask for a teacher in\r\nChristianity. On the recommendation of Ignatius, Constantine was\r\nchosen for this mission, as being particularly qualified by his\r\neloquence and piety. On the road he stopped for some time in Cherson\r\non the Dnieper, where he learned the Khazaric language. The empire of\r\nthe Khazares extended from the Volga and the Caspian Sea, across the\r\nCaucasian isthmus and the peninsula of Taurida, as far as to Moldavia\r\nand Walachia. Several Slavic tribes were tributary to them; but about\r\nthe middle of the ninth century, at the time of Cyril's mission, their\r\npower began to decline; their vassals became their enemies, and\r\ngradually their conquerors; until towards the end of the tenth and at\r\nthe beginning of the eleventh century, their empire became entirely\r\nextinct.[12] Constantine converted and baptized their Khan, whose\r\nexample was followed by a great part of the nation. It was probably\r\nafter he had returned from this mission, that Cyril went to convert\r\nthe Bulgarians. At this time, or just before, according to Dobrovsky's\r\nopinion, he invented the Slavic letters, and translated the Gospels,\r\nduring his stay in Byzantium. This however is nothing more than an\r\nhypothesis, against which other hypotheses have been started by other\r\nscholars. Between A.D. 861 and 863, there came another embassy to the\r\nemperor from the Moravian prince Rostislav, who asked for a teacher,\r\nnot only to instruct his subjects in Christianity more perfectly than\r\nit had been done before, but also to teach them _to read_. Most of the\r\nMoravians were already baptized. Constantine, accompanied by his\r\nbrother Methodius, was sent to Moravia, where the people received them\r\nwith expressions of joy. They introduced here the Slavic liturgy, and\r\npreached in the Slavic language.\r\n\r\nOne peculiar circumstance served to give to their persons a more than\r\ncommon sanctity. Constantine had been so fortunate as to discover in\r\nCherson the bones of the holy Clement, relics which he every where\r\ncarried with him. After three or four years, the pope invited the two\r\nbrethren to Rome, where the possession of these relics procured them\r\ngreat honour and distinction. The pope Adrian, followed by the clergy\r\nand people, met them and their treasure before the gates of the city.\r\nBoth the brothers were consecrated as bishops; those of their Moravian\r\ndisciples who had accompanied them to Rome, were made priests and\r\ndeacons. Constantine received the consecration, but did not accept the\r\ndiocese allotted to him. With the permission of the pope, he adopted\r\nthe name of Cyril, and died forty days afterwards, Feb. 13, A.D. 868.\r\nHis remembrance is cherished as holy by the Slavic nations; and even\r\nas early as A.D. 1056, we find, in the calendar of the _Evangelium of\r\nOstromir_, the fourteenth of February set down for the celebration of\r\nhis memory.\r\n\r\nMethodius returned to Moravia the same year, A.D. 868. He was what was\r\ncalled an _episcopus regionarius_, and had therefore no fixed\r\nresidence. In the letters of pope John VIII, he is called bishop of\r\nMoravia and Pannonia. The first of these countries was at this period\r\nthe theatre of bloody wars; the Slavic inhabitants of the other had\r\nbeen already converted to Christianity by German priests, as early as\r\nA.D. 798. In consequence of this, Methodius found the Latin worship\r\nestablished here, and the Latin language in use. The innovation made\r\nby him, however, was of course greatly favoured by the people; who for\r\nthe first time heard the gospel read to them in a language they\r\nunderstood. But he met with the more opposition from the priests. The\r\nwhole jealousy of the Romish church seems to have been awakened by\r\nMethodius' proceedings. He found however a protector in the pope\r\nhimself; who feared perhaps an entire alienation of the Slavic\r\npopulation, and their transition to the Oriental church; but was at\r\nthe same time desirous to preserve the whole authority of the Latin\r\nlanguage. In a letter to the Moravian prince Svatopluk, he enjoins\r\nexpressly, \"that in all the Moravian churches the gospel, for the sake\r\nof the greater dignity, should be read first in Latin, and afterwards\r\ntranslated into Slavic for the people ignorant of the Latin.\"\r\n\r\nThe question, what part of the Scriptures was translated by Cyril\r\nhimself, what by his brother, and what supplements were made by their\r\nimmediate successors, can now hardly be answered in a satisfactory\r\nmanner. The honour of the invention of the alphabet appears to belong\r\nexclusively to Cyril; but in the sacred work of translation, Methodius\r\nwas not less active; and his merits in respect to the conversion and\r\ninstruction of the Slavi, were more favoured by a longer life.\r\nAccording to John, exarch of Bulgaria, Cyril translated only\r\n_selections_ from the Gospels and the _Apostle_, as the book of Acts\r\nand the apostolic epistles are together called in Slavic; i.e. a\r\n_Lectionarium_, or extracts from those parts of the Scriptures,\r\narranged in such a way as to serve as a lesson for every sacred day\r\nthrough the whole year. The Russians call such a collection\r\n_Aprakoss_, the Greeks [Greek: evangelia, eklogadia]. A work of this\r\ndescription is the above mentioned Evangelium of Ostromir, of the year\r\n1056, written out expressly for the domestic use of Ostromir.\r\n_posadnik_[13] of Novogorod, a near relation of the grand-duke of\r\nIzjaslav. It is however held to be more probable, that Cyril\r\ntranslated at first the whole of the Gospels, as still contained in a\r\nCodes of A.D. 1144, in the library of the Synod of Moscow. The\r\nPresbyter of Dioclea, who wrote about A.D. 1161, ascribes to Cyril not\r\nonly the translation of the Gospels, but also of the Psalter;[14] and\r\nat a later period that of the whole Old and New Testaments, as well as\r\nof the _Massa_, i.e. the Greek liturgy of Basilius and Chrysostom.\r\nThis opinion has since been generally received. In respect to the Old\r\nTestament, however, it is much to be doubted; since no ancient Codex\r\nof it exists, or has ever been proved to have existed. As to the New\r\nTestament, the Apocalypse must at any rate be excepted.\r\n\r\nWhat part of the translation was performed by Methodius does not\r\nappear. John, exarch of Bulgaria, who lived in the same century,\r\ntranslated the books of Johannes Damascenus into Slavic. In the course\r\nof the tenth and eleventh centuries, the Russian and Servian princes\r\ncalled into their empires many learned Greeks, versed in the Slavic\r\nlanguage, that they might continue the holy work of translation.\r\nFrom the historian Nestor it appears, that the Proverbs of Solomon\r\nexisted in the twelfth century in Slavic. The book of Wisdom,\r\nEcclesiastes, the Prophets, and Job, were translated in Servia in the\r\nthirteenth or fourteenth century; the Pentateuch in Russia or Poland\r\nA.D. 1400, or about that time. It is certain, that towards the close\r\nof the fifteenth century, the whole Bible was already translated into\r\nOld Slavic. According to Dobrovsky, the different parts of it were not\r\ncollected until after A.D. 1488, when the Bohemian Bible of Prague was\r\nprinted. This latter served as a model for the arrangement of the\r\nSlavonic Bible; what was wanting was at that time supplied, and those\r\nbooks of the Old Testament which had been translated from the Greek,\r\nwere reviewed and corrected according to the Vulgate. The Codex of\r\nMoscow of A.D. 1499, the most ancient _existing_ copy of the whole\r\nBible in the Old Slavic, is probably at the same time the first which\r\nwas ever wholly completed.\r\n\r\nThe domains of the Old Slavic language, which seemed at first to be of\r\nvery great extent, were soon, by the well known jealousy of the Romish\r\nchurch, limited to Russia and Servia. In Bohemia, which owed its\r\nconversion to German priests, the Slavic liturgy seems never to have\r\nbeen generally introduced; and the old Slavic church language has\r\ntherefore exerted only an inconsiderable influence on the Bohemian. In\r\nPoland too, the Slavic liturgy was only _tolerated_, although the\r\nfirst books with Cyrillic types were printed there. In Moravia,\r\nPannonia, and Illyria, the Slavonic worship was, after some struggle,\r\nsupplanted by the Latin; in the two latter countries, however, the\r\nlanguage was retained, and the occidental church service conducted in\r\nthe Slavic language; i.e. in a language which at that time was\r\nperfectly intelligible to the Illyrians.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the priests of this part of the country had never\r\nadopted the alphabet, which Cyril invented for the benefit of their\r\nbrethren in Pannonia or Bulgaria;[15] who, less advanced in\r\ncivilization than the tribes bordering on Italy, could as yet neither\r\nwrite nor read; while the latter were already in possession of an\r\nalphabet of an ancient and mysterious origin. For the first appearance\r\nof the Glagolitic letters, (_glagol_ signifies in Slavic _word_, or\r\nrather _verb_,) is still buried in perfect darkness. An almost\r\nfabulous antiquity has been ascribed to this alphabet by various old\r\nwriters. According to some it was derived from the Goths or Getæ;\r\naccording to others, from the Phrygians and Thracians; and a very\r\ncommon tradition made St. Jerome, who was a native of Dalmatia, the\r\ninventor of it. The sounder criticism of our age seems at last to have\r\nproved that all these opinions were untenable. The oldest Glagolitic\r\nmanuscript known before 1830 was a Psalter of A.D. 1220; i.e. more\r\nthan three and a half centuries younger than the Cyrillic alphabet,\r\nand evidently copied from a known manuscript written in this latter.\r\nThis, in connection with some other circumstances, induced the learned\r\nDobrovsky to declare the whole alphabet to be the result of a pious\r\nfraud. It seems surprising that this view should have been generally\r\nadopted,--at least for a certain time. It was explained by Dobrovsky\r\nin the following way.\r\n\r\nAt a Synod held at Spalatro in Dalmatia, in A.D. 1060, Methodius,\r\nnotwithstanding he had been patronized by several popes, was declared\r\na heretic, nearly two hundred years after his death; and it was\r\nresolved that henceforth no mass should be read except in the Latin or\r\nGreek language. From the decrees of that Synod, it appears that they\r\ntook the Gothic and Slavonic for the same idiom. A great part of the\r\ninhabitants of Illyria remained nevertheless faithful to their\r\nlanguage, and to a worship familiar to their minds through that\r\nlanguage. A singular means, Dobrovsky asserts, was found by some of\r\nthe shrewder priests, to reconcile their inclinations with the jealous\r\ndespotism of Rome. A new alphabet was invented, or rather the Cyrillic\r\nletters were altered and transformed in such a way, as to approach in\r\na certain measure to the Coptic characters. To give some authority to\r\nthe new invention, it was ascribed to St. Jerome. This, it was\r\nmaintained, is the Glagolitic alphabet, so called, used by the Slavic\r\npriests of Dalmatia and Croatia until the present time. Cyril's\r\ntranslation of the Bible and the liturgic books were copied in these\r\ncharacters, with a very few deviations in the language; which probably\r\nhad their foundation in the difference of the Dalmatian dialect, or\r\nwere the result of the progress of time; for this event took place at\r\nleast 360 years after the invention of the Cyrillic alphabet. With\r\nthis modification, the priests succeeded in satisfying both the people\r\nand the chair of Rome. It _sounded_ the same to the people, and\r\n_looked_ different to the pope. The people submitted easily to the\r\nceremonies of the Romish worship, if only their beloved language was\r\npreserved; and the pope, fearing justly the transition of the whole\r\nSlavic population of those provinces to the Greek church, permitted\r\nthe mass to be read in Slavonic, in order to preserve his influence in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis had come to be pretty generally received; when in the\r\nyear 1830, some Glagolitic manuscripts, which bore very decided\r\nevidence of being at least as old as the middle of the eleventh\r\ncentury, were discovered by Kopitar in the library of Count Clotz in\r\nTyrol. The existence of the calumniated alphabet at a period\r\ncotemporary with the oldest Cyrillic manuscript known (the Evangelium\r\nof Ostromir), was a death-blow to the above singular narrative.\r\nKopitar published the newly discovered Codex, accompanied by a\r\nthundering philippic against the defenders of the former theory, and\r\nin favour of the antiquity of the Glagolitic alphabet, and of the\r\nPannonian origin of the Slavic liturgy.[16] But here the matter\r\nrested. Nothing has since been discovered, (so far as we are\r\ninformed,) to throw light on the first invention or introduction of\r\nthis alphabet; no connecting link to explain its relation to the\r\nCyrillic forms of writing.\r\n\r\nAccording to Vostokof, a Russian scholar of great learning, and one of\r\nthe principal names in Old Slavic literature,[17] the history of the\r\nOld Slavic or Church language and its literary cultivation, may be\r\ndivided into three periods:\r\n\r\n1. From Cyril, or from the ninth century, to the thirteenth century.\r\nThis is the _ancient_ genuine Slavonic; as appears from the\r\nmanuscripts of that period.\r\n\r\n2. From the thirteenth to the sixteenth century. This is the _middle_\r\nage of the Slavonic, as altered gradually by Russian copyists, and\r\nfull of Russisms.\r\n\r\n3. From the sixteenth century to the present time. This comprises the\r\n_modern_ Slavonic of the church books printed in Russia and Poland;\r\nespecially after the _Improvement_ of those writings, so called.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient documents of the Old Slavic language, are not older\r\nthan the middle of the eleventh century. There has been indeed\r\nrecently discovered a manuscript of the translation of John of\r\nDamascus, written by John, exarch of Bulgaria, in the ninth century.\r\nVostokof however proves on philological grounds, that it cannot be the\r\noriginal, but is a later copy. The above-mentioned Evangelium of\r\nOstromir (1056) is the earliest monument of the language, as to the\r\nage of which no doubt exists. It is preserved in the imperial\r\nlibrary at St. Petersburg.[18] According to Vostokof, this is the\r\nthird, or perhaps the fourth, copy of Cyril's own translation. This\r\nlatter is irretrievably lost, as well as the copy which was made for\r\nVladimir the Great, a hundred years afterwards.\r\n\r\nOnly a few years younger is a _Sbornik_, A.D. 1073, or a collection of\r\necclesiastical writings, discovered in the year 1817, and a similar\r\n_Sbornik_ of 1076; the former in a convent near Moscow, the other now\r\nin the library of the imperial Hermitage of St. Petersburg. Further,\r\nthe _Evangelium of Mistislav_, written before the year 1225, for the\r\nprince Mistislav Vladimirowitch; and another _Evangelium_ of the year\r\n1143, both at present in ecclesiastical libraries at Moscow.\r\n\r\nBesides these venerable documents, there are several inscriptions on\r\nstones, crosses, and monuments, of equal antiquity; and a whole series\r\nof political documents, contracts, ordinances, and similar writings;\r\namong which one of the most remarkable is the oldest manuscript of the\r\n_Pravda Russkaya_[19] a collection of the laws of Jaroslav, A.D. 1280.\r\nThe libraries of the Russian convents possess a large number of\r\nmanuscripts; some of which proved to be of great value, when examined\r\nabout twenty years since by a Commission of scholars, appointed\r\nexpressly for that purpose by the Academy of Sciences.[20] The spirit\r\nof critical-historical investigation, which took its rise in Germany\r\nwithin our own century, has penetrated also the Russian scholars; and\r\ntheir zeal is favoured by their government in a manner at once\r\nhonourable and liberal. The task was not small. The Synodal library of\r\nMoscow alone has a treasure of 700 Old Slavic Codices; the Academy of\r\nSciences in St. Petersburg possesses likewise numerous Slavic\r\nmanuscripts. Among the libraries of other countries, there is hardly\r\none of any importance, which has not like Codices of more or less\r\nvalue to exhibit. Those of Vienna and the Vatican are in this\r\ndepartment especially rich. These two were thoroughly searched by a\r\nlike Commission.[21] Of the great activity, and the critical spirit\r\nwhich the Russian historians of our day have shown in respect to their\r\nown past, more will be said in our sketch of the Russian literature.\r\n\r\nThe number of the monuments of the Old Slavic increases considerably\r\nin the _second_ period; and we find ourselves the more obliged to be\r\nsatisfied with mentioning only the most important among them. At the\r\nhead of these, stands the _Laurentian Codex_, the oldest existing copy\r\nof Nestor's Annals, A.D. 1377, now in the imperial library at St.\r\nPetersburg. Nestor, a monk in a convent near Kief, born A.D. 1096, was\r\nthe father of Russian history. He wrote Annals in the Old Slavic\r\nlanguage, which form the basis of Slavic history, and are not without\r\nimportance for the whole history of the middle ages. They were first\r\nprinted in A.D. 1767, and subsequently in four editions, the last in\r\n1796. Schlözer, the great German historian, who published them anew in\r\n1802-9, with a translation, added considerably to their intrinsic\r\nvalue by a critical and historical commentary upon them. But even his\r\nedition could not satisfy the more critical spirit of our days. A\r\nnew one has been published in the course of the last seven years; for\r\nwhich, not less than fifty-three manuscripts were carefully compared.\r\nThe merit of it belongs to the Archæographical Commission of the\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ period begins with the sixteenth century. In the course of\r\ntime, and after passing through the hands of so many ignorant\r\ncopyists, the holy books had of course undergone a change; nay, were\r\nin some parts grown unintelligible. The necessity of a revision was\r\ntherefore very strongly felt. In A.D. 1512, the Patriarch of\r\nConstantinople, at the request of the Tzar Basilius Ivanovitch, sent a\r\nlearned Greek (a monk of Mount Athos) to Moscow, to revise the church\r\nbooks, and to correct them according to the Greek originals. As this\r\nperson some years afterwards fell into disgrace and could not\r\naccomplish the work, it was taken up repeatedly in the course of the\r\nsame and the following century, until the revision of the liturgical\r\nbooks was pronounced to be finished in A.D. 1667; but that of the\r\nBible not before A.D. 1751. The principles on which this revision, or,\r\nas it was called, _Improvement_, was made, were in direct conflict\r\nwith the reverence due to the genius of the Slavic language. The\r\nrevisers, in their unphilosophical mode of proceeding, tried only to\r\nimitate the Greek original, and to assimilate the grammatical part of\r\nthe language, as much as possible, to the Russian of their own times.\r\nThey all acted in the conviction, that the language of the Bible and\r\nliturgical books was merely _obsolete Russian_. Even the latest\r\nrevisers of the Bible, in 1751, knew nothing of Cyril or Methodius;\r\nand had no doubt, that the first translation was made in Russia under\r\nVladimir the Great, A.D. 988, in the language which was then spoken.\r\n\r\nSuch other works in Old Slavic, as were the productions of this\r\nperiod, seem rather to belong to the history of the Russian and\r\nServian literature. We have seen from the preceding, that the Old\r\nSlavic had altered considerably; nay, was in a certain measure\r\namalgamated with those dialects. We shall see in the sequel, how it\r\nwas gradually supplanted by them.[22]\r\n\r\nThe printing of works in the Old Slavic, at the present day, is almost\r\nexclusively limited to the Bible and to what is in immediate\r\nconnection with it. The first printed Slavonic work was set in\r\nGlagolitic letters. This was a missal of A.D. 1483.[23] The earliest\r\nCyrillic printing office was founded about A.D. 1490, at Kracow, by\r\nSvaipold Feol. Nearly at the same time, 1492, they began in Servia and\r\nHerzegovina to print with Cyrillic types. In A.D. 1518, a\r\nCyrillic-Slavonic printing office was established at Venice; and about\r\nthe same time, a part of the Old Testament in the White-Russian\r\ndialect, printed with Cyrillic letters, was published at Prague in\r\nBohemia.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, now the principal seat of the eastern Slavic literature,\r\nprinting was not introduced until after the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. The first work was published in Moscow A.D. 1564, an edition\r\nof the _Apostle_, executed by the united skill of two printers. It\r\nwould seem, however, that they did not succeed in Russia; for a few\r\nyears after we find one of them in Lemberg, occupied in printing the\r\nsame book; and the other at Wilna, in printing the Gospels. In Russia,\r\nthe Gospels were printed for the first time in A.D. 1606. The first\r\ncomplete Slavonic Bible was published at Ostrog in Volhynia (Poland)\r\nA.D. 1581, fol. printed after the manuscript of 1499, which also was\r\nthe first that comprehended the whole Bible.[24] The second edition of\r\nthe whole Slavonic Bible was printed eighty-two years later, at\r\nMoscow, A.D. 1663. An enumeration of all the subsequent editions, is\r\ngiven in the note below.[25]\r\n\r\nThe philological part of the church Slavonic language was not\r\ncultivated so early as would have been desirable. There exists however\r\na grammar by Zizania, published A.D. 1596 in Warsaw. Twenty years\r\nafterwards another by M. Smotrisky appeared, Wilna 1618. This work,\r\nwritten like Zizania's grammar in the White-Russian dialect,[26] was\r\nfor a long time considered as of good authority; it reappeared in\r\nseveral editions, and served as the basis of most of the grammars\r\nwritten during the 17th and 18th centuries. M. Stroyeff found in the\r\nParis library the manuscript of an Old Slavic grammar, written in\r\nLatin by John Uzewicz, a Student of Theology at the University of\r\nParis in 1643. In the year 1822, Dobrovsky published his\r\n_Institutiones Linguæ Slavicæ dialecti vcteris_, a grammatical work\r\nwhich, like all the productions of this distinguished scholar, throws\r\na new light upon the subject, and renders all former works of a\r\nsimilar character useless.\r\n\r\nThe lexical part of this literature is more defective. Most of the\r\nexisting dictionaries are merely short and unsatisfactory\r\nvocabularies. The most ancient is the work of P. Berynda, _Lex.\r\nSlaveno-Russicum_, Kief 1627. More in use at present are the _Kratkoi\r\nSlowar Slavjanskoi_, or 'Short Slavic Dictionary,' by Eugenius, St.\r\nPetersb. 1784; and the larger 'Church Dictionary' by Alexejef, 4th ed.\r\nSt. Pet. 1817-19. A dictionary of this dialect for the special use of\r\nforeigners, does not yet exist.[27]\r\n\r\nIn modern times considerable attention has been devoted to the\r\nexamination of the Old Slavic language and its relation to its kindred\r\ndialects. Antiquarian and paleographical researches have been happily\r\ncombined with philological investigations; and the eminent names which\r\nare found among these diligent and philosophical inquirers, insure the\r\nbest prospects to their cause.[28]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See below in the History of the Russian Language, and the\r\nso called _Improvement_ of the Bible and church books.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In modern times this view has been defended principally\r\nby Russian philologists, the Metropolitan Eugene, Kalajdovitch, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See his _Kyrill und Method_, Prague, 1823.

The northern part of that vast empire, however, was\r\nlong before inhabited by Slavic nations, who seem to have been divided\r\ninto small states under chiefs chosen by themselves; to have been\r\npeaceable in their character, and most of them tributary to more\r\npowerful neighbours. About the middle of the ninth century, civil\r\ndissensions arose among the Slavi of Novogorod, at the election of a\r\nnew head or _posadnik_. Troubled at the same time from without, by the\r\nconquering and enterprising spirit of the Varegians, a Scandinavian\r\ntribe, they no longer felt able to make resistance against them; and\r\ntherefore, A.D. 862, they chose Rurik, the chief of the Varegians, for\r\ntheir own head. These Scandinavians were by the Finns called _Ruotzi_,\r\nan appellation which in their language signifies _strangers_. This\r\nname, in a somewhat altered form, passed over to the inhabitants of\r\nthe acquired territory, with whom the conquerors soon amalgamated.\r\nRurik founded thus the first Slavo-Russian state; and his followers,\r\nlong accustomed to a warlike nomadic mode of life, settled down among\r\nthe Slavic inhabitants of the country. The nationality of the\r\n_strangers_, comparatively few in number, was merged in that of the\r\nnatives; but still, in one respect, it exercised a strong influence\r\nupon the latter, by infusing into them the warlike spirit of the\r\nformer. It is only since that time, that we find the Slavi as\r\nconquerors. Their empire rapidly extended in the course of the\r\nfollowing hundred and fifty years, and their power and external\r\ninfluence also rose; while at the same time the ancient civil\r\ninstitutions of the native Slavi were respected and improved.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the eleventh century, Jaroslav, the son of\r\nVladimir the Great, imitating his father's example, divided on his\r\ndeath-bed his empire among his sons, and thus sowed the seeds of\r\ndissension, anarchy, and bloody wars; a case repeated so often in\r\nancient history, that it seems to be one of the few from which modern\r\nprinces have derived a serious lesson. The Mongols broke into the\r\ncountry; easily subdued the Russians thus torn by internal\r\ndissensions; succeeded, A.D. 1237, in making them tributary; and kept\r\nthem for two hundred years in the most dishonourable bondage. During\r\nthis long period, every germ of literary cultivation perished. In the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century, Ivan Vasilievitch III, [1] delivered\r\nhis country from the Asiatic barbarians, then weakened by domestic\r\ndissensions; conquered his Russian rivals; and united Novogorod with\r\nhis own princedom of Moscow. From that period the power and physical\r\nwelfare of Russia have increased without interruption to the present\r\ntime. The literary cultivation of its inhabitants has likewise\r\nadvanced; at first indeed with stops hardly proportioned to the\r\nexternal progress of the empire; but now for more than a century, in\r\nconsequence of the despotic activity of their sovereigns, with a\r\nwonderful rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe history of Russian literature has five distinct periods. The\r\n_first_ period comprises an interval of more than nine centuries, from\r\nthe date of our first knowledge of the Russian Slavi, to the coming of\r\nage of Peter the Great. A.D. 1689. This period would easily admit of\r\nseveral subdivisions; and did we pretend in these pages to give the\r\nreader more than a _sketch_ of literary history, we should perhaps\r\nfind it advisable to adopt them. This long period, however, both in a\r\ncomparative and an absolute sense, is so very poor, that, limited as\r\nwe are, a few words will suffice to give a general survey of it; and\r\nso much the more, because the productions of this period are closely\r\nconnected with the history of the Old Slavic language, and have mostly\r\nbeen already mentioned under that head.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ period extends from the coming of age of Peter the Great\r\nto the accession of Elizabeth his daughter, A.D. 1741, which was the\r\ncommencement of Lomonosof's influence.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ period extends from Lomonosof, the creator of Russian\r\nprose, to Karamzin, the reformer of it, who was born in 1765.\r\n\r\nThe _fourth_ period covers the interval from Karamzin to the accession\r\nof the emperor Nicholas in 1825.\r\n\r\nThe _fifth_ period begins with the accession of Nicholas in 1825, and\r\ncontinues to the present time.\r\n\r\nBefore however we begin our historical notices, a few words relating\r\nto the characteristic features of the Russian language, may find a\r\nplace here. Three principal dialects are to be distinguished, viz.\r\n\r\n1. The _Russian proper_, the true literary language of the whole\r\nRussian nation, and _spoken_ in Moscow and all the central and\r\nnorthern part of the European Russian empire. And here we will\r\nmention the remarkable fact, that the peasant on the Wolga, on the\r\nOka, and on the Moskwa, speaks the same pure Russian which is heard in\r\nthe parlour and from the pulpit. Vulgar and corrupted branches of this\r\ndialect, are those of Suzdal and Olonetzk, the last of which is mixed\r\nwith Finnish words.\r\n\r\n2. The _Malo-Russian_, the language of the south of Russia, especially\r\ntowards the east. The principal difference between this dialect and\r\nthe Russian proper, consists partly in the pronunciation of several\r\nletters; e.g. in that of the consonant [Cyrillic: character ghe],\r\nwhich sounds in the latter like _g_ hard, but in the former like _h_,\r\nas _hospodin_ instead of _gospodin_, master, lord; partly in many\r\nobsolete forms of expression, which seem to give to the Malo-Russian a\r\nnearer relationship to the Old Slavic, in which similar idioms are to\r\nbe found. The influence of the Poles, who for nearly two centuries\r\nwere rulers of this part of the country, is also still perceptible in\r\nthe language, This dialect is especially rich in national songs. Many\r\nof them are of peculiar beauty, touching _naiveté_; and a poetical\r\ntruth which far outshines all artificial decorations. The greater part\r\nof these songs have an elegiac character; as is the case indeed with\r\nmost productions of the common people.[2] The dialect itself, however,\r\nis far from being less adapted to the expression of the comic. There\r\nexists in it a travesty of the AEneid, written by J. Kotliarevski, a\r\nKozak, which has found great favour throughout all Russia, although a\r\nforeigner is less able to appreciate its peculiarities and beauties;\r\nsince indeed all poetic excellence of a comic description can be felt\r\nonly by those who are familiar not only with the poetic language, but\r\nalso with all those minute local and historical circumstances, the\r\nallusions to which contribute so frequently to augment the ludicrous.\r\n\r\nEssentially the same with the Malo-Russian is the idiom of the\r\n_Russniaks_ in Red Russia, in the eastern part of Galicia, and the\r\nnorth-eastern districts of Hungary; and the few variations which occur\r\nin it have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Comparatively\r\nlittle attention has been paid to this branch of the Slavic race; and\r\ntheir beautiful national songs, scattered among a widely extended\r\npeople, have only recently become the object of curiosity and\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n3. The _White-Russian_ is the dialect spoken in Lithuania and a\r\nportion of White Russia, especially Volhynia. The situation of these\r\nprovinces sufficiently accounts for its being full of Polisms. All the\r\nhistorical documents of Lithuania are written in this dialect; and\r\nseveral Russian writers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nemployed it in preference to the Old Slavonic. The first Russian\r\ntranslation of the Bible was written in it. It is the youngest of the\r\nRussian dialects.\r\n\r\nWhat first strikes us in considering the Russian language as a whole,\r\nis its immense copiousness. The _early_ influence of foreign nations\r\nappears here as a decided advantage. The German, in the highest degree\r\nsusceptible for foreign _ideas_ and forms of _thought_, repels\r\nnevertheless all foreign _words_ and forms of _expression_ as\r\nunnatural excrescences. It is evidently disfigured by the adoption of\r\nforeign words, and can preserve its beauty only by adhering to its own\r\nnational and inexhaustible sources. The Russian, having been in early\r\ntimes successively subjected to the influence of the Scandinavian,\r\nMongolian, Tartar, and Polish languages, is in this respect to be\r\ncompared, in a certain measure, with the English, in which the ancient\r\nBritish, the Latin, the Saxon, the Danish, and the French, amalgamated\r\nin the same proportion as the ideas of these different nations were\r\nadopted. Hence nothing that ever contributed to the singular\r\ncomposition of this rich language, appears to be borrowed; but all\r\nbelongs to it as its lawful property. But the great pre-eminence of\r\nthe Russian appears in the _use_ which it made of these adopted\r\ntreasures. Its greater flexibility made it capable of employing\r\nforeign words merely as _roots_, from which it raised stems and\r\nbranches by means of its own native resources. It is this copiousness\r\nand variety of _radical_ syllables, which gives to the Russian in\r\ncertain respects a claim over all other Slavic languages.\r\n\r\nAnother excellence is the great freedom of construction which it\r\nallows, without any danger of becoming unintelligible or even\r\nambiguous. It resembles in this point the classic languages; from\r\nwhich however its small number of conjunctions decidedly distinguishes\r\nit. This want of conjunctions has been objected to the language as a\r\ndefect; it seems however to be one of the causes, why it is so\r\nremarkably clear and distinct; since it can only admit of\r\ncomparatively short phrases. In spite of this clearness, its\r\nadaptedness for poetry is undeniable; and in this branch the\r\nincomparable national songs extant in it would afford a most noble\r\nfoundation even in respect to forms, if nature could ever obtain a\r\ncomplete victory over the perverted taste of fashion. Whether this\r\nlanguage is really capable of entirely imitating the classic metres,\r\nis still a matter of dispute among distinguished Slavic\r\nphilologians.[3] As to its euphony, what has been said above in\r\nrespect to the Slavic languages in general, may be applied\r\nparticularly to the Russian. Here however the ear of the unprejudiced\r\nlistener alone can decide.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_To the coming of age of Peter the Great_, 1689.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Varegians in respect to the language, appears to\r\nhave been inconsiderable; their own idiom on the contrary being soon\r\nabsorbed by that of the natives. Rurik's grandsons had already Slavic\r\nnames.[4] The principal event in those ancient times, and one which\r\nmanifested its beneficent consequences in respect to civilization\r\nhere, as every where, was the introduction of Christianity, towards\r\nthe end of the tenth century. Vladimir the Great, the first Christian\r\nmonarch, founded the first schools; Greek artists were called from\r\nConstantinople to embellish the newly erected churches at Kief; and\r\npoetry found a patron and at the same time her hero in Vladimir.\r\nVladimir and his knights are the Russian Charlemagne and his peers,\r\nking Arthur and his Round table. Their deeds and exploits have proved\r\na rich source for the popular tales and songs of posterity; and serve\r\neven now to give to the earlier age of Russian history a tinge of that\r\nromantic charm, of which the history of the middle ages is in general\r\nso utterly void. The establishment of Christianity was followed by the\r\nintroduction of Cyril's translation of the Scriptures and the\r\nliturgical books. The kindred language of these writings was\r\nintelligible to them; but was still distinct enough from the old\r\nRussian to permit them to exist side by side as two different\r\nlanguages; the one fixed and immovable, the voice of the Scriptures,\r\nthe priests, and the laws; the other varying, advancing, extending,\r\nadapting itself to the progress of time.\r\n\r\nThat this latter, the genuine old Russian, had its poets, was, until\r\nthe close of the last century, only known by historical tradition; no\r\nmonument of them seemed to be left. But at that time, A.D. 1794, a\r\nRussian nobleman, Count Mussin-Pushkin, discovered the manuscript of\r\nan epic poem, 'Igor's Expedition against the Polovtzi,' apparently not\r\nolder than the twelfth century. It is a piece of national poetry of no\r\ncommon beauty, united with an equal share of power and gracefulness.\r\nBut what strikes us even more than this, is, that we find in it no\r\ntrace of that rudeness, which would naturally be expected in the\r\nproduction of a period when darkness still covered all eastern Europe,\r\nand of a poet belonging to a nation, which we have hardly longer than\r\na century ceased to consider as barbarians! There hovers a spirit of\r\nmeekness over the whole, which sometimes even seems to endanger the\r\nenergy of the representation.\r\n\r\nThe genuineness of this poem has, so far as we know, never been\r\nquestioned; but it is indeed a very surprising feature, that during\r\nthe recent diligent search through all the libraries in the country\r\nafter old manuscripts, not a single production has been discovered,\r\nwhich could in any way be compared with it. This remarkable poem\r\nstands in the history of ancient Russian literature perfectly\r\nisolated; and hence exhibits one of the most inexplicable riddles in\r\nliterary history.[5]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the Russians enjoyed at this early period as much mental\r\ncultivation as any other part of Northern Europe. There were several\r\nwriters even among their princes. Jaroslav, the son of Vladimir the\r\nGreat, was not less active than his father had been in advancing the\r\ncause of Christianity, and all that stands in connection with\r\nreligion. He sent priests throughout the whole country to instruct the\r\npeople, and founded in Novogorod a theological seminary for three\r\nhundred students. He took care that the translation of the church\r\nbooks was continued; but the most remarkable monument of his reign, as\r\nwell in an historical as in a philological respect, is the _Pravda\r\nRusska_, a collection of laws.[6] Another grand duke of Russia,\r\nVladimir Vsevolodovitch Monomach, who died in 1125, wrote\r\n'Instructions for his Children;' one of his successors, Constantine\r\nVsevolodovitch, a hundred years later, produced a history of the\r\nRussian princes, which is now lost. The clergy, safe in their cells\r\nfrom the tempests of war, were busy in translating from the Greek;\r\nNestor wrote his valuable annals;[7] another priest, Basilius,\r\ndescribed the cotemporary events in the south of Russia; Sylvester,\r\nbishop of Perejaslavl, ob. 1124, and several others of the clergy,\r\ncontinued Nestor's annals;[8] while Hegumen Daniel wrote his travels\r\nto Palestine in the beginning of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nThe theological productions of the early portion of this period, are\r\nof less value than the historical. It was however this field, that was\r\ncultivated most diligently. There are several sermons, or rather\r\nsynodal _oraisons_, still extant; some of which, by another Cyril,\r\nmetropolitan of Kief, A.D. 1281. are said to be not without real\r\neloquence. Most of the productions of this early period, which belong\r\nindeed more to the history of the Slavonic than of the Russian\r\nliterature, perished in the devastations and conflagrations of the\r\nMongols.\r\n\r\nFrom A.D. 1238 to 1462, the Russian princes, as we have seen, were\r\nvassals of the Mongol Tartars, or the _Golden Horde_.[9] In the course\r\nof these two centuries, nearly every trace of cultivation perished.\r\nNo school existed during this whole time throughout all Russia. The\r\nMongols set fire to the cities; sought out and destroyed what written\r\ndocuments they could find; and purposely demolished all monuments of\r\nnational culture. The convents alone found in their policy a sort of\r\nprotection. Science therefore became more than ever the exclusive\r\npossession of the monks. Among these, however, no trace of classical\r\nlearning, and hardly a show of scholastic wisdom, was to be found.\r\nFortunately they improved their time as well in respect to posterity\r\nby writing annals, as for their own personal benefit by accumulating\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nThe re-establishment of Russian independence in the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century, had a reviving influence on national science and\r\nliterature. The nation however had been too long kept back, ever to be\r\nable to overtake their western neighbours. From this point a new\r\ndivision of this period begins. Some of the Russian princes were men\r\nof powerful and active minds; they invited artists and physicians from\r\nGreece, Italy, and Germany, into their country, and rewarded them\r\nliberally. Ivan IV,[10] A.D. 1538-84, ordered schools to be founded in\r\nall the cities of his empire; under his reign the first\r\nprinting-office was established in Moscow in 1564. Soon afterwards a\r\ntheological academy was founded at Kief. Boris Godunof, 1598-1605,\r\nsent eighteen noble youths to study at foreign universities. The\r\nprinces of the house of Romanof showed themselves not less active.\r\nAlexei and Fedor, the father and brother of Peter the Great, opened\r\nthe way for that bold reformer, and appear as his worthy predecessors;\r\nindeed the merit of several improvements, which have been generally\r\nascribed to Peter, belongs to them. During this whole later period,\r\nthe Polish language and literature exerted a decided influence on the\r\nRussian; and some writers began to use the dialect of White Russia, an\r\nimpure mixture of the two,[11] while the pure Russian was despised as\r\nmerely fit for vulgar use. The Malo-Russian also, or Ruthenian\r\ndialect, was, by the influence of the Polish language, cultivated\r\nbefore the pure Russian; which last began, only in the latter half of\r\nthe seventeenth century, to shake off these chains and acquire for\r\nitself an independent form.\r\n\r\nThe first germs of dramatic art were likewise carried from Poland to\r\nRussia. In Kief, the theological students performed ecclesiastical\r\ndramas; and travelled about during the holidays, to exhibit their\r\nskill in other cities. The scenes which they had to repeat most\r\nfrequently, were the three Children in the fiery furnace, and Haman's\r\nexecution. The tragedies of Simeon of Polotzk, in the Old Slavic\r\nlanguage, had great success in the middle of the seventeenth century.\r\nTheir renown penetrated from the convents to the court; where they\r\nwere performed before Tzar Fedor, the predecessor of Peter.[12] His\r\nminister, Matveyef, the Slavic Mecaenas of his time, and himself a\r\nwriter, invited the first stage-players to Russia; and at his\r\ninstigation, the first secular drama, a translation of Molière's\r\n\"Médecin malgré lui,\" was played before the gratified princesses and\r\ntheir enraptured maids of honour. The sister of the two Tzars, the\r\nTzarevna Sophia, was a great patroness of the dramatic art: and was\r\nherself the author of several tragedies and comedies, which were acted\r\nbefore her by her ladies.\r\n\r\nThis latter portion of the first period, poor as it is, has\r\nnevertheless several books of travels to exhibit. A merchant of\r\nTver, Athanasius Nikitin, travelled in the year 1470 to India, visited\r\nthe Dekkan and Golconda, and gave on his return a description of those\r\ncountries. Two other merchants of Moscow, Korobeinikof and Grekof,\r\ndescribed a century later their travels through Syria, Palestine and\r\nEgypt. Fedor Baïkof, Russian envoy to China, published likewise a book\r\nof travels in that remarkable country.\r\n\r\nIn the department of history, this portion of the first period was\r\nsurprisingly productive. Not only were the Annals of the venerable\r\nNestor, the basis of all Slavic history, continued by the monks with\r\nfidelity and zeal; but a whole series of other annals, biographies of\r\nsingle princes, and chronographies, were produced; and even some\r\nforeign nations received their share of attention.[13] The reader\r\nhowever must not expect to find a vestige of philosophical genius, nor\r\na philosophical representation of the events. Entirely unacquainted\r\nwith classical literature, the Greek writers of the Byzantine age were\r\ntheir only models. The best that can be expected is a dry and faithful\r\nnarrative of facts.[14]\r\n\r\nThe weakest part of the literature of this later portion of the\r\nperiod, is the theological branch; a sketch of which however may not\r\nbe inappropriate here. It is true, that the _Improvement_ of the old\r\nchurch books was executed with much zeal; but in what spirit this was\r\ndone, in a philological respect, we have mentioned above in the\r\nhistory of the Old Slavonic literature, to which the labours of the\r\ntranslators properly belong. Nikon, patriarch of Russia, ob. 1681,\r\ncarried on this work with the greatest activity; and besides this set\r\non foot a collection of historical annals.[15] The light of the\r\nReformation, which at that time spread its beneficent beams over all\r\nEurope, and exerted particularly such a strong influence on Poland,\r\ndid not penetrate into the night of the Russian church; the gloom of\r\nwhich, however, had always been mitigated by a spirit of meekness and\r\nChristian charity. Still, we notice among the pulpit productions of\r\nthis time somewhat of the polemic genius of the age. It was not,\r\nhowever, against the bold innovations of Lutherans or Calvinists, that\r\nthe clergy found occasion to turn their weapons, but against the\r\n_Jewish_ heresy![16] A translation of the Psalms of David, Moscow\r\n1680, deserves to be distinguished among similar productions. The\r\nwriter was the monk Simeon of Polotzk, author of the above-mentioned\r\nspiritual dramas, and instructor of the Tzar Fedor. Still more\r\nremarkable is the first attempt to translate the Bible into the\r\nRussian language. Francis Skorina, the translator, likewise a native\r\nof Polotzk, where the Polish influence was stronger than in any\r\nother quarter, was a doctor of medicine; but the time had now come\r\nwhen it began to be felt over all Europe, that the holy volume did not\r\nbelong exclusively to the clergy. Some parts only of his translation\r\nhave been printed.[17]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the sixteenth century, several printing offices had\r\nbeen established in Russia, almost exclusively for the benefit of\r\ntheological works. Nearly all the historical writings were preserved\r\nin manuscript; and have been first printed in modern times. The\r\nawkward appearance of Cyril's alphabet seemed to add an unnecessary\r\ndifficulty to the diffusion of the knowledge of reading. Towards the\r\nend of the seventeenth century Elias Kopiovitch made some improvement\r\nin the appearance of the Slavic letters; it was however reserved to\r\nPeter's reforming hand, to give to them a fixed and permanent shape.\r\n\r\nSECOND PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From the majority of Peter the Great, A.D. 1689, to Lomonosof, A.D.\r\n1741._\r\n\r\nThe history of the genuine Russian literature begins only with the\r\nadoption of the language of the people for all civil writings. It was\r\nPeter the Great, who raised this language to be the language of public\r\nbusiness, in which all transactions of the courts of justice\r\nhenceforth were to be held, and all ordinances to be issued. Ere this\r\nenergetical man was able to establish a Russian printing office in his\r\nown empire, in order not to lose time, he gave a privilege for\r\nfifteen years to the Dutch printer Tessing for Russian works. It was\r\nin Amsterdam, in 1699, that the first Russian book was printed. About\r\nthe year 1704, Peter himself invented some alterations in the Slavic\r\nletters, principally so as to make them more similar to the Latin. He\r\ncaused a fount of these new types to be cast by Dutch artists; and the\r\nfirst Russian newspaper was printed with them at St. Petersburg in\r\n1705. These letters, with some additional alterations during the\r\ncourse of the following ten years, were generally adopted for the\r\nRussian language, and are in use at the present time. The same\r\nletters, with a few slight variations, are also used by that portion\r\nof the Servians who belong to the eastern church; the other portion\r\nmaking use of the Latin alphabet. In all theological writings,\r\nhowever, the ancient forms of the letters are preserved. This is the\r\ndifference between the _grashdanskii_ and _tzerkvennii_, or the civil\r\nand church alphabet.[18]\r\n\r\nThe energy with which this emperor, _a real autocrat_, proceeded,\r\ncaused his people to overleap a whole century. If there is something\r\nrevolting to a liberal mind, in the despotic haste with which he\r\ndeprived a great nation at once of a part of their nationality,\r\nthrough his arbitrary decision in all that he deemed best for them;\r\nstill it serves greatly to allay this feeling, to observe that the\r\nresistance which he experienced did not proceed from the people, but\r\nalmost exclusively from the obstinate pride of a spoiled nobility, and\r\nthe narrow-minded policy of an ignorant and jealous priesthood. The\r\nRussian nation itself is indeed, more than any other people,\r\nsusceptible of deep impressions. Hence they are in general not averse\r\nto innovations; and were in Peter's time, as now, willing to be\r\nconducted by a hand acknowledged as that of a superior. In\r\nconsequence of these very national qualities, good or bad, they are\r\ncapable of being readily moulded into any new form.\r\n\r\nWhether the rapidity, nay, vehemence of the Tzar's improvements were a\r\nreal benefit to the nation, this is not the place to examine; but for\r\nthe free development of the language and literature, it is evident,\r\nthat his proceedings were injurious, notwithstanding their apparently\r\nwonderful effect. Although the language possesses all the elements of\r\ncompleteness, and notwithstanding the not inconsiderable mass of\r\ntalent which has developed itself in the course of time, the Russian\r\nliterature has perhaps not yet produced a single work of great and\r\ndecided _original_ value. The best works which they have, are\r\nimitations; and he is the most distinguished writer whose discernment\r\nleads him to choose the best model. No doubt, the present standing of\r\nthe Russian literature _in general_ would have been much lower, and\r\nits extent especially would have been much smaller, than it now is,\r\nhad the Russian genius been permitted to break its own way through the\r\ndarkness; but there is still less doubt, that in this case it would\r\nhave preserved its original peculiarity, that wonderful blending of\r\nthe East and the West, of Asiatic suppleness and European energy, of\r\nwhich their popular songs give such affecting, and in some cases\r\npowerful specimens.\r\n\r\nPeter, without delay, caused many books to be translated into Russian,\r\nfrom the German, French, English, and Dutch languages. The haste\r\nhowever with which this was performed, and the greater attention of\r\nthe Tzar to the _matter_ than to the _form_, had the natural\r\nconsequence, that most of these translations were miserable\r\nproductions, executed without the least regard for the language\r\nitself. Peter's only object was to enable his subjects to become a\r\n_reading_ people, and to communicate to them useful knowledge through\r\nthe medium of books. Beauties of style, and even mere purity of\r\nlanguage, belong in a certain measure to the luxuries of literature;\r\nthe Tzar thought only of utility.\r\n\r\nThese innovations in literature found of course a great many opponents\r\namong the clergy; but there were some enlightened priests, among those\r\nwho held the highest standing in the church, who favoured in general\r\nthe Tzar's plan. The field of theology became somewhat more cultivated\r\nduring this period. Theophan Prokovitch, archbishop of Novogorod, ob.\r\n1736, alone wrote sixty works, of which however only about half were\r\nprinted. He was Peter's faithful assistant; and not only his learning\r\nand mental gifts, but his high moral character, gained him a decided\r\ninfluence. He was styled the Russian Chrysostom.\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan of Rostof, called the holy Demetrius, ob. 1709, was\r\nlikewise a very productive theological writer. He was considered by\r\nhis contemporaries as a true pattern of Christianity; and was equally\r\ndistinguished for his learning. The metropolitan Stephen Javorsky, ob.\r\n1722, was celebrated for his eloquence in the pulpit. Gabriel\r\nBushinsky, bishop of Rjazan and Murom, ob. 1731, was not only a\r\ntheological writer, but translated also works on history. A remarkable\r\nexample in this period, is Elias Kopiyevsky,[19] ob. 1701, who studied\r\ntheology in Holland, and became a protestant, and afterwards a pastor\r\nat Amsterdam. He aided zealously in Peter's great work of\r\ntranslations. Several historical and philological works translated by\r\nhim, were published by Tessing. Luther's Catechism was translated\r\nabout the same time by the pastor Glück of Livonia, who had been made\r\na prisoner by the Russians and carried to Moscow. It was in his house\r\nthat Catharine, the future empress of Russia, was brought up.[20]\r\nAmong the secular writers of this period, prince Antiochus Kantemir,\r\nob. 1745, must above all be mentioned. Of Greek extraction and born in\r\nConstantinople, with all the advantages of an accomplished education,\r\nand in full possession of several highly cultivated languages, he\r\nnevertheless chose the Russian idiom for his poetical productions.\r\nThese are mostly satires, and evidently bear the stamp of a thorough\r\nknowledge of the classics. Besides these he wrote on different\r\nsubjects of natural philosophy; and translated a selection from the\r\nEpistles of Horace, and Fontenelle's work on the plurality of worlds.\r\nAbout the same time, Leont. Magnitzky wrote the first Russian\r\nArithmetic with Arabic numerals.\r\n\r\nAmong the lyric poets two Kozaks, Cyril Danilof and Semen Klimofsky,\r\nare named with some distinction. The first of the two, better known\r\nunder the diminutive of his name, _Kirsha_ Danilof, deserves\r\nparticular attention. The Russians have their cyclus of heroic\r\nlegends, as well as the occidental nations. Vladimir and his Boyars\r\nare to them what Arthur and his Round table, Charlemagne and his\r\ntwelve peers, are to Britons, Franks, and Germans. These traditions\r\nlived still among the people in Kirsha Danilof's time; and yet live to\r\nsome extent as nursery tales. Kirsha versified them; and, we fear,\r\nchanged them according to the spirit of his time. They have only been\r\nprinted and published in the present century, at least seventy-five\r\nyears after they were written; for Kirsha was a cotemporary of Peter\r\nI. It is no doubt to him, that we owe their preservation through an\r\nage of a false and pedantic taste, which could only have despised\r\nthese relics of barbarism, and during which they were forgotten by the\r\nFrenchified literati.[21] In historical contributions this period is\r\nnot wholly poor; but as the writers paid not the slightest attention\r\nto style, or did not know from what principles to begin, the language\r\nremained entirely uncultivated. There was as yet no thought of a\r\nRussian _Grammar_. In poetry the system of rhymed verses, in which the\r\nsyllables were not measured, but counted, in imitation of the Poles,\r\nreigned exclusively. Meanwhile the popular songs held faithfully to\r\nthe old Russian irregular but highly musical numbers, consulting only\r\nthe ear. Trediakofsky, born 1703, was the first who examined more\r\nclosely the nature of the language, and advised the adoption of the\r\nclassical metres founded on quantity. He applied on this point merely\r\nthe principles which Zizania and Smotrisky, nearly a century before,\r\nhad established for the Old Slavic idiom, and with equal propriety.\r\nBut, as the talent for illustrating his rules by good examples was\r\nwanting in him, he made very little impression; and his name and\r\nendeavours were soon forgotten.[22]\r\n\r\nTHIRD PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From Lomonosof to Karamzin, A.D._1741--1796.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the epoch from which the temple of Russian\r\nliterature, as it appears at present, must be dated. It was Peter's\r\nhand that laid the corner-stone; it was Lomonosof who raised it above\r\nthe ground; whilst the fortunate turns of Elizabeth's and Catharine's\r\nvanity caused it to be filled with more worshippers than would\r\notherwise ever have sought the way thither. Academies were founded for\r\nthe sciences and arts; numerous institutions for the education of all\r\nclasses and ages were created and endowed with true imperial\r\nmagnificence. In the year 1758 the university of Moscow was founded;\r\nwhile other scientific institutions of all descriptions were\r\nestablished by Catharine's unbounded liberality. In the year 1783 the\r\nfree establishment of printing offices was permitted; of course not\r\nwithout reserving to the government the privilege of a strict\r\ncensorship. A seminary for educating teachers for popular schools was\r\nerected, with the intention of founding Gymnasia all over the country.\r\nThese measures, no doubt, had an essential and beneficial influence on\r\nthe general civilization of the nation. But the common people, the\r\npeasantry, remained entirely neglected.\r\n\r\nIt was however in a family of the lowest standing, that Michael\r\nLomonosof was born, A.D. 1711. His father was a fisherman in the\r\ngovernment of Archangel. During the long winters, when his father's\r\ntrade was interrupted, Lomonosof learned to read of one of the church\r\nservants. The beauties of the Bible, and the singing of the Psalms\r\nduring the church service, in the rhymed translation of Simeon of\r\nPolotzk, first awakened his own poetical faculties. An ardent desire\r\nfor an education caused him to leave home privately and seek his way\r\nto Moscow, where, he was told, was an institution, in which foreign\r\nlanguages were taught. Circumstances proved fortunate; he found\r\nliberal patrons; was educated afterwards in Kief and St. Petersburg,\r\nand obtained means to go to Germany. Here he connected philosophy with\r\nthe mathematical studies which he had hitherto chiefly pursued;\r\ndevoted a part of his time to the science of mining, at the\r\ncelebrated school in Freiburg; and sat in Marburg at the feet of the\r\nphilosopher Wolf. In passing through Brunswick, he escaped with\r\ndifficulty the horrors of the Prussian military system. He succeeded\r\nin reaching Holland, and thence returned to his own country; where he\r\nwas well received and honourably employed by the government. He died\r\nA.D. 1765, in the enjoyment of high general esteem, but not that\r\ndegree of reputation which has been allotted to him by a more\r\njudicious posterity. He first ventured to draw a distinct boundary\r\nline between the Old Slavic and the Russian languages; which hitherto\r\nhad been confounded in a most intolerable manner. In his Russian\r\nGrammar, he first laid down principles and fixed rules for the general\r\ncompass of the language; without however checking the influence of the\r\nChurch Slavonic more than was necessary, in order to preserve the\r\nidentity of the former. He wrote a sketch of Russian History, a long\r\nand tedious epic poem called the _Petreide_, speeches, odes,\r\ntragedies, and several works on chemistry and mineralogy. None of his\r\nproductions are without merit; but he was more a man of sagacity and\r\nstrong talent, than of poetical genius. His poems are all cold and\r\nartificial; excepting perhaps his version of a few chapters of the\r\nbook of Job, where the beauties of the original appear to have\r\ninspired him. His speeches and odes are written in the same style of\r\npanegyric, which then reigned, and which reigns still, in all the\r\ncreations of Russian poetry or prose having the least reference to the\r\nimperial family; and which, in connection with the boastful style of\r\nall productions purporting to describe national deeds, is a real\r\nblemish upon the Russian literature, fitted to render it disgusting to\r\nall foreigners.[23]\r\n\r\nThe two most celebrated writers among Lomonosof's cotemporaries,\r\nthough somewhat younger than he, were Alexander Sumarokof, ob. 1777,\r\nand Michael Kheraskof, born 1733, ob. 1807. Both were very productive\r\nwriters in prose and poetry, overwhelming the reading public with\r\ntragedies and comedies, odes and epistles; and the latter also with\r\ntwo long epic poems, one in twelve, and the other in eighteen cantos!\r\nBoth were highly admired, and the overflowings of their pens were\r\ndevoured with avidity. Kheraskof was called the Russian Homer. The\r\nchildhood, in which Russian literature then was, is not the age of\r\ncriticism; sounder judges of later times have allotted to those\r\nproductions a place hardly above mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThe first Russian theatre was instituted in Jaroslav. A.D. 1746. The\r\npermission, which the actors obtained A.D. 1754, to establish\r\nthemselves in St. Petersburg, and still more the foundation of a\r\nnational stage in Moscow in 1759, served much to awaken the decided\r\ndramatic talent of the Russians; a faculty in which they are perhaps\r\nincomparable, and certainly are not surpassed by any other nation.\r\nSeveral gifted literary men employed themselves in writing for the\r\nstage. Such were J. Knjashnin, ob. 1791, an imitator of the French,\r\nbut not without talent of his own; Von Wisin, ob. 1792, the author of\r\ntwo comedies, full of genuine comic power; Maïkof, Nicolef, Klushin,\r\netc. The distinguished productions of Von Wisin alone have continued\r\nto hold possession of the stage.[24]\r\n\r\nAs the most prominent poets of a miscellaneous character the following\r\nmay be mentioned: Hippolit Bagdanovitch, born 1743, ob. 1805, author\r\nof a tale in verse, _Dushenka_, Psyche, not without gracefulness and\r\n_naiveté_; Chemnitzer, ob. 1784, the writer of the best Russian\r\nfables; Gabriel Dershavin, born 1743, ob. 1816, the most celebrated\r\nRussian poet of his time. The glory of Catharine II, and of the\r\nRussian army, was his favourite theme; but even the panegyrical style\r\nof his odes, the most dangerous enemy not only of moral, but likewise\r\nof poetical truth, cannot destroy the power of his truly poetical\r\ngenius. His ode _To God_ has obtained the distinction of being\r\ntranslated not only into several European languages, but also into\r\nChinese, and hung up in the emperor's palace, printed with golden\r\nletters on white satin.[25] Further, Vasilii Kapnist, born 1756, ob.\r\n1823, who as a lyrical poet stands next to Dershavin; Bobrof,\r\nfamiliarly acquainted with English literature, which he endeavoured to\r\nimitate, full of imagination, but bombastic and obscure; Prince\r\nDolgoruky. distinguished by a philosophical vein; Neledinsky-Meletzky,\r\nwhose songs are known even by the lower classes.\r\n\r\nDuring this period also the field of translation was not less\r\ncultivated. Kostrof translated the Iliad in rhymed verses, A.D. 1787,\r\nand also Macpherson's Ossian from the French. Petrof gave a version of\r\nthe Æneid in 1793. Bulgakof first made the Russian public acquainted\r\nwith Ariosto; Popovsky with Pope and Locke, etc.--As a writer of\r\ngeneral and favourable influence on literature, we must not forget to\r\nname N. Novikof, editor of several periodical journals, author of the\r\nfirst Russian bibliographical work, and a man of that general literary\r\nactivity, which, even without productiveness of its own, induces\r\nothers to exercise theirs.\r\n\r\nThe patriotism which caused the Russians ever to pay a certain\r\ndegree of attention to their national history, deserves the highest\r\npraise. During all periods of their literature, this branch has been\r\nattended to with diligence. It is however especially the laborious\r\ncollection and faithful preservation of materials, for which posterity\r\nis indebted to them; since there is little of a philosophical spirit\r\nto be found in their arrangement of these materials; and in regard to\r\nthe language in which they are presented, it is striking to observe\r\nhow the Russian prose was always far behind the Russian poetry. G.F.\r\nMüller, ob. 1783, a German by birth, but who devoted all his life to\r\nRussian literature, published the first Russian periodical, dedicated\r\nchiefly to historical objects.[26] He also caused several old\r\nmanuscripts to be printed; and added greatly to their value by his\r\ninvestigations and commentaries. Prince Shtsherbatof wrote fifteen\r\nvolumes of Russian history, besides several smaller works,--a mere\r\ncollection of facts, but rendered more important by a review and\r\ncriticism upon them by Boltin, ob. 1792, a distinguished historian.\r\nTchulkof wrote a history of commerce; Jemin, Rytchkof, Golikof, and\r\nothers, wrote on particular portions of Russian history.\r\n\r\nFor the philological studies of the language, the foundation of the\r\nRussian Academy. A.D. 1783, was of great importance. A standard\r\ngrammar and etymological dictionary were published by it in 1787-90,\r\nfounded on a plan perfectly new, and in the merit of which the empress\r\nCatharine had no small personal share. Her example awakened not a\r\nfew Mecænases among the _magnates_ of the country; and it became a\r\npoint of high ambition to favour literature and literary men.[27]\r\n\r\nAs for theological and biblical science, scarcely any thing\r\ninteresting, certainly nothing gratifying, meets our eye in this vast\r\ndeserted field. Except a few didactic works on dogmatics and rhetoric,\r\nseveral catechisms and similar productions, this department is limited\r\nexclusively to sermons, or rather synodal discourses. There is not\r\nalways a want of talent, and sometimes even a rich share of natural\r\npower; but the language, though first developed in similar\r\nproductions, is here so full of bombastic, tasteless, and mere\r\nrhetorical ornaments, that the _thought_ seems to be entirely drowned\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nDemetrius Sjetchinof, metropolitan of Novogorod, ob. 1767, and the\r\narchbishop of White Russia, Konissky, oh. 1795, are considered as not\r\nbeing without eloquence. Platon Levshin, metropolitan of Moscow, was\r\nthe most productive of the ecclesiastical writers. He died in 1812,\r\nand continued to write until the end of his life; his productions\r\nconsequently, in respect to time, belong partly to the next period of\r\nRussian literature.[28] Anastasius Bratanofski, archbishop of\r\nAstrachan, ob. 1806, takes the first place among Russian\r\necclesiastical orators, in respect to style and command of language;\r\nthough higher powers and profounder feelings are ascribed to an\r\narch-priest of Kief, Ivan Levanda, ob. 1814. Here our catalogue\r\nterminates. All the remaining ecclesiastical writers of any\r\ndistinction, although only a few years younger than those here\r\nmentioned, seem in respect to language to belong to the following\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nFOURTH PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From Karamzin, A.D._ 1796, _to the commencement of the reign of the\r\nemperor Nicholas in_ 1825.\r\n\r\nThe number of Russian writers increases during this period so\r\nconsiderably, that we feel more than ever obliged to limit ourselves\r\nto the most distinguished; thus, no doubt, passing over in silence\r\nmany a name more deserving to be mentioned than others of the\r\npreceding periods, which borrowed a comparative lustre only from the\r\npoverty of the times.\r\n\r\nThe emperor Alexander, during the first years of his reign, showed a\r\nzeal for the mental cultivation and enlightenment of his subjects,\r\nwhich presented him to the eyes of admiring Europe in the light of one\r\nof the great benefactors of mankind. Whoever will take the trouble to\r\nfollow the career of this prince closely, and contrast the shouts of\r\nacclamation with which the world hailed him at first, with the\r\ndisesteem into which the same individual a few years afterwards\r\nshrunk, as a weak and insignificant being,--and then again compare the\r\nenthusiasm with which during the time of his better fortunes he was\r\nreceived anew as the deliverer of Europe, with the part which was\r\nafterwards assigned him in the system of _obscurantismus_ supposed to\r\nbe adopted by the united sovereigns of Europe,--whoever considers all\r\nthis, cannot but be struck with the small portion of discernment and\r\ndiscrimination which is manifested in the world. A sober and\r\nkeen-sighted observer might have seen even in the beginning, glorious\r\nas it was, that not all is gold that glitters. All that was done, was\r\naccompanied with a noise and boasting which strangely imposed upon\r\nforeigners. Universities, on the plan of the venerable institutions of\r\nlearning in Germany, were founded, where all the preparation necessary\r\nin order to profit by them was wanting; and the profoundest sciences\r\nwere professedly taught to pupils, who were still deficient even in\r\nelementary knowledge. We do not however mean to say, that much real\r\ngood was not done; and even if some of the new institutions were not\r\npropitious in their immediate results, still the time has come, or\r\nwill come, when all of them are or will be at least in a measure\r\nuseful. The establishment of numerous common schools of a less\r\nelevated character throughout the whole empire, deserves unqualified\r\npraise. More than fifty higher schools, called gymnasia or\r\ngovernmental schools, and twice as many lower or provincial schools,\r\nwere established under Alexander's reign alone.[29]\r\n\r\nBesides the universities, eight in all, of which Alexander founded\r\nfive, there are a considerable number of professional schools; among\r\nwhich are four theological academies. In the year 1823, an Institution\r\nfor the study of oriental languages was founded at St. Petersburg; and\r\nin 1829 a similar one at Odessa, a city which has by its location more\r\nnatural advantages for the learning of Asiatic languages than any\r\nother, and where for most of them native teachers may be readily\r\nobtained. On the other hand, the Asiatic Museum, attached to the\r\nschool at St. Petersburg, contains all the means and aids for those\r\nstudies to be met with at a more remote place. Richly endowed by the\r\nmunificence of the emperor Alexander, who caused scientific treasures\r\nof every kind to be liberally purchased, it was also greatly augmented\r\nduring the late war with Persia; where by order of the emperor all\r\nconquered cities were deprived of their libraries, whether public or\r\nprivate; while, by a stipulation in the treaty of peace, the Persian\r\ngovernment was compelled to deliver to Russia towards four hundred\r\nmanuscripts, a list of which was drawn up by the orientalists Frähn\r\nand Senkofsky. Among these were the geography of Ptolemy, and several\r\nArabic translations of Greek and Latin works, lost in the original\r\nlanguages. Although the object of the oriental schools in Russia was\r\noriginally to educate translators for diplomatic missions, they have\r\nproved themselves very useful to oriental philology in general;\r\nespecially through the many gifted Germans in the Russian service, who\r\navail themselves gladly of opportunities for those studies which their\r\nown country cannot give. It will however be seen in the sequel, that\r\nseveral learned Russians also have paid an honourable attention to\r\nthis branch, especially within the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Bible Society, founded A.D. 1813. was at first patronized\r\nby the emperor. Under its auspices, and at the instigation of the\r\nemperor himself, there was prepared a version of the Scriptures in the\r\nRussian dialect. In the year 1820, not less than 50,000 copies of the\r\nGospels and the Acts were issued from the press; in 1823 the whole New\r\nTestament was finished, and in the course of eight months 20,000\r\ncopies were distributed. For this translation the peasantry, to whom\r\nthe Old Slavic church Bible was only half intelligible, showed such an\r\neagerness, as soon to excite trouble among the clergy. In some of the\r\ngovernments, remote from the capital, the readers of this version of\r\nthe Bible had to encounter serious persecution. In respect to\r\ntranslations into foreign languages, a kind of rivalship arose between\r\nthe parent society in England and the daughter in St. Petersburg.\r\nBesides the preparation by the latter of translations into\r\n_thirty-one_ different languages and dialects within the limits of the\r\nRussian empire, she likewise took care of several Asiatic nations,\r\nand founded auxiliaries in the deserts of Siberia, and also in the\r\nmidst of the Kozaks of the Don and the Circassian provinces. In A.D.\r\n1820, this society had fifty-three sections and 145 auxiliaries; and\r\nthe number of copies of whole Bibles and of New Testaments\r\ndistributed, exceeded 430,000. But in 1822, the society held its last\r\naniversary; and three years later, some of the more important Russian\r\nclergy succeeded in closing the series of annual reports. In April\r\n1826, the activity of the society was ultimately terminated, or, as it\r\nwas expressed, _was suspended_, by the Ukase of the emperor Nicholas,\r\nat the instigation of the metropolitans Eugene and Seraphim. Since\r\nthat time, only the sale of the copies already printed has been\r\npermitted.[30]\r\n\r\nThe Russian Bible Society stood of course in connection with societies\r\nfor Foreign Missions; but was active in this respect chiefly through\r\nthe agency of the United or Moravian Brethren. In 1823 the Moravians\r\nof Sarepta sent, with the express consent of the minister of\r\nEcclesiastical Affairs, two missionaries to the Kalmuks; into whose\r\nlanguage the Gospels had been translated at St. Petersburg by Schmidt.\r\nIn the same degree that they found the people susceptible for divine\r\ntruth, did they meet with opposition from the priesthood. The Khans,\r\nyielding to the influence of the priests, threatened to emigrate; and\r\nthe Russian government found it advisable to withdraw the mission. An\r\ninteresting report of this mission was published in 1824, in the\r\nJournal of St. Petersburg. In the year 1824, a mission of the Greek\r\nchurch, at the instigation of the bishop of Archangel, was sent to the\r\nSamoyedes. This was the first attempt ever made to convert that\r\nsavage people to Christianity; of the results we are not informed.\r\n\r\nThe compass of Russian literature extended itself during the course of\r\nAlexander's reign, or rather from A.D. 1800 to 1822, with a most\r\nremarkable rapidity. In the year 1787 the number of books written in\r\nthe Old Slavonic and Russian dialects, did not exceed 4000;[31] before\r\n1820 twice that number was counted; the year 1820 alone produced 3400\r\nworks, 800 of them translations from the French, 483 from the German,\r\nand more than 100 from the English. Sopikof, in his bibliographical\r\nessay, enumerates the titles of 13,240 Russian and Slavonic books,\r\nprinted in Russia from A.D. 1552 to 1823. But at this time literature\r\nseems to have reached its height in respect to productiveness; and\r\nsunk again with a still greater rapidity, probably in consequence of\r\nthe political measures of the government. The year 1824 produced only\r\n264 Russian works. The yearly average of literary productions,\r\noriginal and translated, from 1800 to that time, is about 300 to 400.\r\nThis number perhaps will not strike the reader as so very small, if he\r\nis informed that in the whole eighteenth century only 1000 works were\r\nprinted. Three hundred and fifty living authors were enumerated in the\r\nyear 1822; mostly belonging to the nobility, and only one eighth part\r\nto the clergy. Their literary activity towards the end of this period,\r\nand at the commencement of the next, was in a great measure confined\r\nto works of fiction; especially novels end lyrical poetry. But at this\r\ntime a deeper interest in their national history began to be awakened.\r\nThis department indeed had never been entirely neglected; and more\r\nthan 10,000 manuscripts, unopened and unexamined, lay scattered\r\nthroughout the imperial and monastic libraries.\r\n\r\nNicholas Karamzin, from the commencement of whose influence this\r\nperiod of Russian literature is in general dated, was born A.D. 1765.\r\nHe was educated in the house of a German professor at Moscow. In spite\r\nof the early development of his literary propensities, he entered the\r\nmilitary service, which was then considered as the most honourable in\r\nRussia. After two years spent in travelling through Europe, he opened\r\nhis literary career with the publication of a periodical work called\r\nthe Moscow Journal, which exercised a decidedly favourable influence\r\non Russian literature; although those productions of Karamzin himself,\r\nwhich first appeared in this journal, evidently bear the stamp of the\r\nauthor's youth. Both in his prose writings and in his scattered\r\nlyrical poems, at this period, there is a certain dulcet\r\nsentimentality, behind which we look in vain for energetic or true\r\npoetic thoughts. He showed more maturity in his second periodical,\r\ncalled the European Messenger; where political and moral subjects\r\noccupied his pen. But his principal reputation rests upon his History\r\nof the Russian Empire. In composing this work, he was greatly favoured\r\nby the government; all the archives were opened to him; all documents\r\ndelivered into his hands; and when it was completed, rewards and\r\ngratuities of every description were heaped upon the author with\r\nimperial munificence, and continued to his widow and children after\r\nhis decease in 1826. [32]\r\n\r\nThe beauties of Karamzin's style are so entirely _idiomatic,_ that no\r\none, who is not perfectly and thoroughly acquainted with the language,\r\nis able to appreciate in what the charm of his writings consists. To\r\nforeigners of sound critical taste, on the contrary, the productions\r\nof his early life exhibit an affectation, a pretension to feeling, and\r\nan emptiness of original thought, sometimes quite intolerable. And as\r\nto the more condensed and exact style of his great historical work,\r\neven the highest beauties of diction, and the acknowledged diligence\r\nand accuracy of the writer's examination of facts, could never\r\nreconcile us to that _want of truth_, which, without wresting the fact\r\nitself, impresses upon it a false character by the whole colouring and\r\nmode of representation. Over the characteristic barbarism of ancient\r\ntimes his dexterous hand throws a veil of embellishment, and lends a\r\nspirit of chivalry and romantic charm to historical persons and deeds,\r\nwhere all the circumstances of place and time stand in absolute\r\ncontradiction to it. Not seldom do we seem to be perusing a novel.\r\n\r\nBy this mode of proceeding he of course flattered the national\r\nfeelings of his countrymen; and thus gained their approbation and\r\napplause, in the same measure that he disgusted all other nations. His\r\nHistory of Russia will nevertheless remain a standard work in Slavic\r\nliterature, partly on account of the copiousness of its sources,\r\npartly because of the great learning and research displayed by its\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nIn respect to Karamzin's innovations on the language, his influence\r\nwas early counterbalanced. He considered the French or English mode of\r\nconstruction as better adapted to the present state of the Russian\r\nlanguage, than that imitation of the classical structure, which had\r\nhitherto given to the Russian prose writings so stiff and awkward an\r\nair. He himself adopted with ease and gracefulness the peculiarities\r\nof these modern languages; but a portion of his followers thought to\r\nreach the same object by introducing Gallicisms. Just at the proper\r\ntime an opposition was formed; the head of which, Admiral Shishkof,\r\ninsisted upon preserving the influence of the Church Slavonic upon the\r\nRussian language; and reproached Karamzin with having injured the\r\npurity of the latter by the introduction of foreign forms. These two\r\nparties, which still divide the Russian literature in some measure,\r\nare called the _Russian_ and _Slavonic_, or also the Moscow and St.\r\nPetersburg parties.\r\n\r\nNot much less influence than Karamzin on the Russian prose, has Ivan\r\nDmitrief, born 1760, exercised on poetry. He had more taste and purity\r\nthan any of his predecessors; and was the first to prove by a great\r\nmany poetical tales, fables, odes, etc. that imagination and\r\ncorrectness of language are not incompatible. The most successful of\r\nhis followers are the following:\r\n\r\nVassilii Shukofsky, born 1784, a poet of true and deep feeling,\r\nwithout affectation, possessing more of what the Germans call\r\n_subjectivity_, than any other Russian writer. He took the Germans for\r\nhis models, and partly imitated and partly translated them with\r\nsuccess. Ivan Koslof, interesting by his personal character and trying\r\nmisfortunes, must be mentioned as one of the most happy translators\r\nfrom the English and German. His literary talents were awakened only\r\nwhen he had lost the power of enjoying the world. Early in life he was\r\ndeprived by sickness of the use of his limbs; and of his eyes, some\r\nyears after. He bore this great affliction with the most amiable\r\nphilosophy; devoted himself entirely to literature; and studied and\r\nimitated the English poets, chiefly Byron. Another successful\r\ntranslator of this great poet, who excited as much interest in Russia\r\nas in any other country, was Baron Rosen. Further, as lyrical poets,\r\nare also esteemed: Prince Vjazemsky, Vostokof distinguished as an Old\r\nSlavic philologist, Chwostof, Batjushkof,[33] Rileyef,[34] Baron\r\nDelwig, Glinka, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Russian poets stands, almost without a rival,\r\nAlexander Pushkin, born 1798, ob. 1835; but as his principal\r\nproductions belong to the next period, and his influence is chiefly\r\nperceptible among the more recent poets, we defer for the present a\r\nfuller notice of his writings and his fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe Russians are particularly fond of fables. Besides Chemnitzer,\r\nmentioned above, who is flat and prosy, Ivan Krylof, born 1768, is\r\ncelebrated in this department. He may be truly called the favourite of\r\nthe nation. His fables, equally popular among all classes and\r\nconditions of life, are the first book that a Russian child reads. A\r\nconsiderable portion of them has been translated into French and\r\nItalian; partly by Count Orlof at Paris, and partly by friends of the\r\nlatter, ladies and gentlemen of the most fashionable society in that\r\ncapital, among whom that nobleman distributed the labour of\r\ntranslation. He then published them, with the original, in the year\r\n1825. The perfect harmlessness and _naiveté_ of this author has made\r\nhim also a favourite of the government; and when, twelve years ago, he\r\ncelebrated his seventieth birthday, honours and distinctions of all\r\nkinds were accumulated on his head.\r\n\r\nAs dramatic poets, Shakhofskoi, Chmelnitzky, Gribojedof,[35] and\r\nOzerof, must be mentioned; the first three chiefly as writers of\r\ncomedies; the last as the author of a very popular drama entitled\r\n_Gore ot Uma_, Miseries of Intellect. While it cannot be doubted that\r\nthe Russians have a decided talent for the comic, both as writers and\r\nas actors, it is still a fact that they have never produced a single\r\ntragedy of great power. Ozerof, who wrote quite a number of them,\r\nbelongs more in spirit to the preceding period; during which the\r\nFrench was the only acknowledged model. The success he met with can\r\nbe explained only by the want of competitors.\r\n\r\nNo form of poetry has found more favour in Russia than the historical\r\nnovel. It was cultivated to some extent at this time; but the flower\r\nof this branch falls more properly within the following period. A\r\nvoluminous novel, entitled _Bursak_ by B. Nareshnoi, belonged to\r\nanother species. It was written with a good deal of harmless humour,\r\nsomewhat in the style of Le Sage's Gil Blas. It narrated the history\r\nof a _Bursarian_, or scholar of one of the monastic seminaries in\r\nMalo-Russia; and is full of adventures, lively descriptions of\r\nmanners, and amusing incidents.[36]\r\n\r\nThe literature of translations continued to occupy very many pens.\r\nHere must be mentioned: Gnjeditch's version of the Iliad; Merzljakof's\r\ntranslation of Tasso's Jerusalem; Wojeikof's Æneid; Martynof's\r\ntranslation of several ancient classics, etc.\r\n\r\nTo foreigners, the travels of the Russians by sea and land offer the\r\nmost interesting and instructive part of their literature. The most\r\ndistinguished of their well known expeditions have indeed been\r\nconducted by Germans, as Krusenstern, Kotzebue, Bellinghausen,\r\nWrangel; some however by Russians, as Golovnin, Lazaref, and others;\r\nand the results of all of them contribute to the honour of Russia, and\r\nare laid up in the temple of her literature. The regions of\r\nMalo-Russia, the Caucasus, and Taurida, of which comparatively little\r\nwas known, were explored by Muraviev-Apostol, Glinka, Bronefsky, and\r\nothers; and described by them in valuable volumes. An account of China\r\nby Timkofsky, was translated in 1827 into the English language. The\r\nworks of the monk Hyacinth Bitchourin, head of the Russian\r\necclesiastical mission at Pekin, published in 1828-32, are of great\r\nimportance for the knowledge of China, Thibet, and the country of the\r\nMongols.[37] The great patriot and protector of science, Romyanzof,\r\nwhose name is known throughout the civilized world, caused Abalghasi's\r\n_Historia Mongolorum et Tartarorum_ to be printed in 1825, under the\r\nspecial care of the distinguished German oriental scholar Frahn. The\r\npublication of the Mongol work. _History of the Eastern Mongols and\r\ntheir Princes_, written by Ssanang Ssetzen, with a German translation\r\nand illustrations and remarks by J.J. Schmidt, although no Russian\r\nwork, may be mentioned here; as it was only made possible by Russian\r\nmeans, and the support of the emperor. The same author, known to the\r\nliterary world by his learned Researches in Eastern Asia, translated\r\nalso the Gospels into the Mongol and Kalmuk languages for the\r\nRussian Bible Society. A Mongol Grammar was prepared by him in 1828,\r\nand the Mongol-German-Russian Dictionary was announced in 1834. A\r\nMongol-Russian Dictionary had been previously published by Igumnof of\r\nIrkutzk. Volkof composed a Tartar Dictionary, an earlier one having\r\nbeen written by Giganof in 1804. For the study of the Armenian,\r\nnumerous opportunities are presented; the Armenian archimandrite\r\nSeraphim published in 1819 an Armenian elementary Encyclopedia, and in\r\n1822 a Russian Armenian Dictionary. But the oriental studies of the\r\nRussians are not limited to the languages of the Russian empire. A\r\nHebrew Grammar has been published by Pavsky, the learned author of\r\nthe Russian version of the Old Testament; and in the year 1821 there\r\nwere, according to Henderson, not less than forty of his pupils\r\nemployed as teachers in the different academies and seminaries\r\nthroughout the country. An Arabic Grammar has been published by\r\nBoldryef, and also a Persian Chrestomathy in 1826. Senkofsky\r\ntranslated the _Derbent-Nahmeh_; and also edited with considerable\r\nadditions the French-Arabic dictionary, originally written by the\r\nSwede Berggren, a work of great utility to the Arabic scholar; not a\r\nmere vocabulary, but full of geographical notices and general\r\ninformation; in short a work which, according to the prospectus\r\nwritten by the learned Frähn, \"contains every thing that can be useful\r\nto the traveller, diplomatic agent, missionary, physician or\r\nmerchant.\" The editor among other things has added in Roman characters\r\nthe vulgar pronunciation of the Arabic, which differs materially from\r\nthat given by the grammarians.\r\n\r\nAmong the ecclesiastical writers of this period, Ambrosius Protasof\r\narchbishop of Kazan and Simbirsk, and Philaret Drozdof archbishop of\r\nMoscow, are considered as the most eloquent. The last is the author of\r\nseveral works on church history. Other theological writers are the\r\nfollowing: Eugene Bolchovitinof metropolitan of Kief,[38] Ambrosius\r\nPodobjedof metropolitan of Novogorod, and Michael Dosnitzky\r\nmetropolitan of St. Petersburg. Stanislas Bogush, a Roman Catholic\r\npriest, published a history of Taurida and several other historical\r\nworks in the Russian language. The branch of _Memoires_ in the French\r\nsense of the word, has recently been much cultivated. The publications\r\nof Count Munich, in 1818; of Prince Shakhofsky, 1821; of General\r\nDanilevsky. 1830; and of Admiral Shishkof, 1832; are valuable\r\ncontributions to the history of our time. The two latter, although\r\nbelonging to the next period in respect to the years of publication,\r\nare nevertheless productions of the period now under review, and refer\r\nchiefly to it.\r\n\r\nThe national feeling of the Russians has led them, during the period\r\nof their literary history, to examine the nature of their language;\r\nand all philosophical investigations, or antiquarian researches, which\r\ncould throw additional light upon the past, have been favoured by\r\npersons of distinction and influence; as for example, by Admiral\r\nShishkef, himself a writer on various subjects. With this view he\r\ncaused a new edition of the Dictionary of the Russian Academy to be\r\npublished; and set on foot the preparation of another more perfect\r\nwork of that kind, founded on an improved plan.[39] To this class of\r\nphilological antiquarians belong the names of Vostokof already cited\r\nin these pages, Sokolof, Kalaïdovitch, and Stroyef; the two latter\r\nlearned and judicious commentators on old manuscripts which they first\r\npublished, and which but for them would still lie mouldering in dust\r\nand oblivion. In the department of literary history and bibliography,\r\nwe find as writers of merit, P. Köppen, author of the well-written\r\narticle \"Kunst mid Alterthum in Russland\" in the Vienna _Jahrbücher_,\r\nand of various valuable paleographic and other essays in the Russian\r\nlanguage; also Gretsch, Sopikof, Anastasevitch, the metropolitan\r\nEugene above mentioned, Pletuef, Mussin-Pushkin, Korshavin,\r\nKatchenofsky, etc. etc. The principal activity and success of this\r\nschool falls within the next period.\r\n\r\nFIFTH PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From A.D. 1825 to the present time._\r\n\r\nThe reign of the emperor Nicholas opened with a bloody tragedy, which\r\nconcerns us here only so far, as the dissatisfied, effervescing,\r\nunhealthy spirit of the literary youth of Russia was in a very\r\nstriking manner exhibited in it.\r\n\r\nSeveral poets and men of some literary fame were among the\r\nconspirators. Rileyef, Bestushef, and others, became the victims of\r\ntheir imprudence. An analogous spirit had some years before banished\r\nyoung Pushkin from the capital. It was evident, that the Russian muse\r\nwas no longer the good old gossiping lady in French court-dress and\r\nhoops, who was ready to drop a humble courtesy to every person of rank\r\nand influence; she was no longer the shepherdess who had inspired\r\nDmitrief with his sweet yet tame verses; she had been by the example\r\nand the pernicious influence of the modern philosophical schools\r\ngradually metamarphosed into a wild romantic girl, burning with desire\r\nto drink freely, and without being watched by police agents, from the\r\ntrue source of poetry open to all nations; to rove about in the world\r\nof imagination free from fetters and restraint. The means which the\r\nemperor chose to cure her from these eccentricities; to chain her at\r\nhome by endearing it to her; in short, to _Russify_ her again; were\r\ncertainly _judicious_.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the spirit of historical and archaeological\r\nresearches, as well as the interest for the study of the Slavic\r\nlanguages, was already awakened in the preceding period. The\r\ngovernment did every thing to favour it, and to nurse that truly\r\npatriotic zeal which tries to penetrate the past in order to search\r\nfor those links which connect it with the present. All influence from\r\nwithout was as much as possible checked; the professorships of\r\nphilosophy were abolished at all the universities (1827); the scissors\r\nof censorship were directed to cut sharper; the catalogue of forbidden\r\nbooks was made longer; the permission to travel was often denied, and\r\nthe term of lawful absence for a Russian subject confined to five\r\nyears. But in the interior, within the safe inclosure of the Chinese\r\nwalls of protection against the epidemic fever of the age, the most\r\nenergetic measures were taken to promote national education, and to\r\ncultivate those fields of science where no political tares could be\r\nsown among the grain.\r\n\r\nOf all political ideas, one at least was favoured; and this was the\r\ngreat idea of _Panslavism_, that is, of the close connection or union\r\nof all the Slavic races among themselves. Of this great family, some\r\nof whose members after a short period of flourishing life are\r\nwithering fast away, if not supported by the whole, Russia is the\r\nnatural head, the great animating soul, into which the other parts all\r\nmust naturally be absorbed at last. This idea, first scientifically\r\nwrought out by Bohemian scholars, and cherished by their pride, which\r\nwas justly offended by the oppressions and undisguised contempt\r\nexperienced from the Germans, was well received by the Russian\r\nliterati; and even by many of those who naturally loved the Poles, and\r\ndid not approve of the harsh measures of the Russian government. There\r\nwas even in Poland itself a school which adopted this view; nay,\r\nsome distinguished Polish scholars claim it as their own original\r\nidea. According to them, the Austrians and Prussians alone were the\r\nreal usurpers; in being absorbed by Russia as a member of the great\r\nSlavic empire, Poland yielded only to its fate, and could hope for a\r\nmore glorious _Panslavic_ resurrection, i.e. a resurrection as a\r\nmember of the great whole.[40]\r\n\r\nIn reference to the critical researches, which were made through all\r\nbranches of history, the period now under review may be appropriately\r\ncalled the _historical_ period. The investigations of the\r\nArchæological Commission, have been mentioned above. It was first\r\nappointed in 1834; and considerably enlarged in 1837. The examination\r\nof manuscripts was not confined to the libraries of the empire;\r\nStroyef was sent to Paris, Newerof to Germany, Solovyef to Denmark and\r\nSweden, Wenelin to Bulgaria; and Nadeshdin travelled among the\r\ndespised Russian tribes of Northern Hungary. In 1844, five volumes of\r\nRussian annals were printed; besides a series of historical and\r\njuridical documents which had preceded them. The Moscow Historical and\r\nGeographical Society, an older institution, and also the St.\r\nPetersburg Historical Society founded in 1846, have contributed their\r\nshare of information; and a general interest has been awakened among\r\nthe higher classes of society.\r\n\r\nThe new critical spirit of the times was first perceptible in the bold\r\nattitude assumed by the editor of a periodical work, called the\r\n_Telegraph_. Polevoi was a self-made man, a merchant without classical\r\neducation, without deep learning, and indeed without depth in any\r\nthing. He had however by an uncommon share of sagacity, by a rare\r\nenergy of thought, and a restless activity, gained more influence over\r\nhis countrymen than any previous writer; and succeeded In giving to\r\nhis very popular periodical an important voice in all matters of\r\nliterature. In the year 1829 he announced a new History of Russia, in\r\ntwelve volumes; and at the same time expressed the opinion, that\r\nKaramzin's work was to be called neither practical nor philosophical,\r\nand was no longer worthy of the present standing of Russian\r\nliterature. His own publication, which followed soon afterwards, and\r\nwas executed with the rapidity which was characteristic of the man,\r\nproved that it is easier to point out the deficiencies of others, than\r\nto avoid them ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe young historical school found another champion in Sergei\r\nSkromnenko, who attacked the authority of Nestor, or at least the age\r\nascribed to this first Russian annalist; essaying to prove that he did\r\nnot write before the beginning of the fourteenth, or perhaps towards\r\nthe end of the thirteenth century.[41] Another young historian, J.\r\nBodianski, defended this opinion. W. Perewostschikof examined it in a\r\nseparate work.[42] Pogodin, a name of more weight, refuted it in his\r\n_Studies on Nestor_; and it seems since to have been given up.\r\n\r\nAnother production of some importance was an \"Essay towards a\r\nGeography of the Old Russian World,\" by Nadeshdin; in which the author\r\nattempted with ability and success to trace the old seats of the\r\nSlavic nations. Several monographs and histories of particular regions\r\nor periods appeared in the interval between 1830 and 1842. Such were\r\nthe histories, e.g. of the unfortunate Prince Ivan and his relatives,\r\nby Polenof; of Catharine II. by Lefort; of Tzar Boris Godunof, by\r\nKrayefski; of Peter II, by Arsenief. Also a History of the time of\r\ntroubles (as the period between Boris Godunof and the reign of the\r\nhouse of Romanof is called) by Buturlin; the biographies of the first\r\nthree Tzars of the house of Romanof, by Berg; the histories of Kief by\r\nSamailof, of Pskow by Pogodin, of Siberia by Slowzof; of the fair of\r\nNishni Novogorod, which goes back to the fourteenth century, by Zubof;\r\nof the Zaporoguean Kozaks by Sreznefski. This latter valuable work is\r\nespecially rich in historical popular songs, never before printed.\r\nFurther, the History of the insurrection of Pugatschef, by the poet\r\nPushkin; the Historical and statistical survey of Russia, by T.\r\nBulgarin; and the Memoirs for Russian History by Svinyin (ob. 1839);\r\nmust be here mentioned. The two latter had hitherto been more known as\r\nwriters of novels than as historians; and the rosy light which the\r\nfirst of the two tries to throw over his subject, seems still to\r\ntestify more to his talent for romance than to his historical\r\ntruthfulness.\r\n\r\nThis was however the spirit in which the government wished its\r\nhistorians to write. A work of decided importance appeared in 1839, a\r\nHistory of Russia, in which the principles of _Panslavism_ were\r\ndeveloped in a striking manner. The author, Professor Oustrialof, who\r\nhad made himself favourably known by several monographs relating to\r\nRussian History, has displayed in the above-mentioned work not only\r\nconsiderable acuteness, but also a great deal of research,\r\nconsistency, and thoroughness.[43] His principal tendency is to\r\nrepresent Russia as the natural central point of the Slavic race. The\r\nimmediate result of the appearance of this work was, that Oustrialof\r\nwas commissioned by the government to write a compendium or guide for\r\nhistorical instruction in all the schools of the empire.\r\n\r\nAlthough this view may be called the most popular in Russia, it\r\nappears from the decided predilection with which Russian writers of\r\nhistory devote their pens to subjects anterior to the reign of Peter\r\nI, that they consider the comparatively greater liberty which is\r\nallowed them in their researches into the history of this earlier\r\nperiod as a decided advantage. Karamzin had proved by the picture he\r\ndrew of Ivan the Terrible, that, at this remote period at least,\r\njustice was free. It may thus be explained, why Boris Godunof, the\r\nfriend of the people, the promoter of liberal ideas and modern\r\nimprovements, is a favourite subject of the young historical school.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of modern history has in Russia its own difficulties, which\r\nmay easily be comprehended; and nothing is permitted to appear without\r\nthe approval of the government. General Michailovski-Danilevski, who\r\nwrote a history of the war of 1812-14, may be considered as its true\r\nrepresentative. He ascribes all the merits of the final victory of the\r\nAllies to the Russians alone. Among several works of that time written\r\nin an analogous spirit, the \"Description of the campaigns of 1812 and\r\n1814\" must be noticed; because the author is a lady by the name of Dorof,\r\nwho served in the army as a common soldier, and describes only what she\r\nsaw. An anonymous work, written by an eye-witness, gives an account of\r\nthe Turkish war in 1828-29. The work entitled \"Biographies of the Russian\r\nAdmirals\" (1834), gives a history of the Russian navy.\r\n\r\nIn no department has Russian Literature remained more behind its age,\r\nthan in the treatment of foreign history, and especially European\r\nhistory. The series of publications which have appeared relating to\r\nit, consist almost exclusively of defective translations, or weak\r\nimitations. For the Russian scholar this defect was less essential\r\nthan for the public in general, as all of them read foreign languages.\r\nPogodin has recently begun to give more attention to this subject.\r\n\r\nIn respect to several Asiatic nations we are almost entirely\r\ndependent on Russian writers. The priest Hyacinth, honourably\r\nmentioned in connection with this branch, continues his useful\r\nactivity. Chopin on the provinces of the Caucasus (1840); Nefedyef on\r\nthe Wolga-Kalmuks (1835); several articles in the Siberian Mercury, a\r\nperiodical; a History of the Mongols, from the Persian, by Grigoryef;\r\nthe Kirgises of the inner Horde, by Khanikof; and several publications\r\nof the Geographical Society of St. Petersburg; deserve to be noticed\r\nhere. The works of two foreigners, one by Haguemaster on the Commerce\r\nwith Persia and Turkey, the other by Chaudoir on the Numismatics of\r\nChina, Japan, and Korea, may also be included; as they appeared\r\nsimultaneously in the Russian and French languages, and were both of\r\nthem occasioned by the Russian government.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the Russians for Law as a science has only recently\r\nbeen excited. Prince Peter of Oldenburg, a cousin of the emperor,\r\nfounded a Law School in 1832. Since that time the nobility have\r\nendowed several professorships of law in the universities; and the\r\nnames of N. Krylof and Manoshkin have become favourably known in this\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nIn Statistics the name of Arsenyef is an authority. Many valuable\r\ncontributions are to be found in Stepanof's Description of the\r\nGovernment of Yennissci, and in various Russian periodicals;\r\nespecially in the annals of several Bureaus, which are from time to\r\ntime published by the government, and the Statistical Annuals edited\r\nby the Academy.\r\n\r\nThe literature of Travels cannot well be very rich at the present day,\r\nin a country where travelling to foreign lands meets with so many\r\ndifficulties; and where even travels in the interior are at least not\r\nmade very easy. To the most valuable productions in the first\r\ndepartment belong: Norof's Journey to the Holy Land, St. Pet. 1838;\r\nDavidof's to Greece and Italy; Demidof's to Moldavia and Wallachia;\r\nKorf's to Persia; Wcewolodski to the East and through Europe;\r\nGretsch to the Western countries of Europe, etc. Two collections of\r\n_old_ travels, viz. one containing those made by Russians to foreign\r\ncountries, among which is the description of a journey to the Holy\r\nLand in the twelfth century; another comprising the accounts of\r\nforeigners who travelled in Russia in olden times; have also recently\r\nbeen published.\r\n\r\nModern works of travels in Russia have been written by A. Demidof,\r\nBaer, Böthlingk, Glagolyef, Kavelin, and others. Most of these\r\njourneys were made for certain scientific purposes. Mouravyef's\r\nPilgrimage to the holy places of Russia must be classified rather as a\r\nwork of religion.\r\n\r\nAnd here a short survey of this latter branch of Russian literature\r\nmay naturally be subjoined. To it belong the other works of the writer\r\njust mentioned; who is attached to his own church with an almost\r\nfanatical enthusiasm. They are, first, a History of the Greek Church;\r\nsecondly, Letters on the Greek Church Service. An elaborate History of\r\nthe Russian Patriarchate, published a few years ago, is ascribed to\r\nthe bishop Philarete, a clergyman who is said to have shown an\r\nimmoderate zeal in making proselytes in the Baltic provinces. A\r\nbiographical History of the Russian Saints, by Yeristof, belongs also\r\nhere. Of theological _science_ there can hardly be a trace, in a\r\ncountry where all free investigation in exegetical matters is cut off.\r\nTheological literature is entirely confined to synodal orations and\r\nsome ascetic writings. The spirit of the present age in Russia is\r\nstrictly orthodox; and the monocracy of the Greek Church is the great\r\nobject for which clergy and laity exert themselves; especially in the\r\nBaltic provinces. Among sermons, those of Innocenz, vicar of the\r\nmetropolitan of Kief, are much admired.\r\n\r\nLiterary history has recently been a favourite branch. Polevoi,\r\nGretsch, Schevyrof, Maximovitch, Nadeshdin, Nikitenko; and, in respect\r\nto languages and antiquities, Kalaidovitch, Vostokof and Koppen, the\r\nlatter of German extraction, and mentioned in the preceding period;\r\nare the names which have most weight in these matters.\r\n\r\nWe have at last come back to _belles lettres_, the department of\r\nliterature by which the genius of a nation is most distinctly\r\ncharacterized. The tendencies which in Russia prevail in the other\r\nbranches, viz. a revival of interest for all that is native, Slavic,\r\nor relating to the past; the reaction from a period of fondness for\r\nall that was foreign and outlandish; is very clearly perceptible also\r\nin this portion of literature. Yet the Russians, once forcibly thrust\r\ninto the way of _imitation_ by their great Tzar, appear here even now\r\nonly as imitators; and are still far from having found the path back\r\nto their simple popular poetry.\r\n\r\nAfter this remark it cannot surprise us, that towards the close of the\r\nlast, and especially at the beginning of the present period, the\r\nhistorical novel was cultivated with particular fondness; and was\r\nalmost exclusively devoted to _Russian_ history. T. Bulgarin, P.\r\nSvinyin, Sagoskin, Massalski, wrote the most approved works of that\r\nkind. More recently the novelists have rather returned to the\r\ndescription of morals and manners, as their more appropriate province.\r\nPawlof, Prince Odoyeski, Lermontof, Gogol, Laschetnikof, Weltmann,\r\nDahl, who writes under the name of Kozak Luganski, are the most\r\npopular writers of tales. Karamzin and Shukofski are still considered\r\nas models in this department.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget to mention here the unhappy youth Alexander\r\nBestushef; who, as lieutenant in one of the Petersburg regiments, was,\r\nlike his friend Rileyef, implicated in the conspiracy of 1825. He was\r\ndeprived of his nobility and illustrious name, and sent to the mines\r\nof Siberia; afterwards, as a species of pardon, he was placed as a\r\ncommon soldier in the army of the Caucasus, where he rose to the\r\nrank of an officer and fell soon after by the balls of the Therkesses.\r\nHe had been well known to his countrymen as the editor of a favourite\r\nAnnual, entitled the _Polar Star_; and as the author of a very\r\nspirited and clear survey of Russian literature, distinguished by\r\ncharacteristic sketches of some of their principal poets. The name of\r\nBestushef was buried; but its bearer succeeded a second time in\r\nacquiring a literary reputation under the name of Alexander Marlinski.\r\nHis Sketches of the Caucasus and of Siberia, his tales entitled Amulat\r\nBeg and Mullah Nur, are animated and spirited pictures of scenes quite\r\nnovel and fresh. He has been compared to the German novelist Spindler;\r\nbut, although this latter has the advantage in respect to invention,\r\nwe think Marlinsky _far_ superior to him in a poetical respect. There\r\nis a vigour, a freshness, an originality, in some of his descriptions,\r\nwhich would class him among true poets, even when stripped of the\r\nnovelty of the scenery among which they are laid, and which gives them\r\nindeed a peculiar attraction. Nothing was more natural nor even more\r\nhonourable to the Russian public, than that, as an unavoidable effect\r\nof the pity and interest felt for this young writer, his real talent\r\nshould have been for a short time overrated. But even after his death,\r\nit seems that the government regarded this enthusiasm with suspicion;\r\nfor in a literary collection in which the unprinted works of one\r\nhundred writers are promised,[44] accompanied by their portraits,\r\nMarlinsky's portrait was not permitted to appear.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Russian literati has been for some time directed\r\nmainly by the Germans to their own treasures of popular poetry. They\r\nare particularly rich in nursery tales, for which the nation indeed\r\nhas always had a great fondness; but which, during an age of a false\r\npedantic taste, were after all not thought worthy of literary\r\npreservation until of late. In close connection with this subject is\r\nthe cultivation of popular dialects. Grebenko and Kwitka, the latter\r\nunder the name of Osnovianenko, wrote their charming novels in the\r\nMalo-Russian or Ruthenian dialect. Several writers of talent, natives\r\nof Malo-Russia, endeavoured to establish their language as a literary\r\nlanguage in opposition to the Great Russian. The judiciousness of\r\nthese proceedings, especially as the Russian literature has hardly\r\npassed from childhood to youth, would seem very questionable, even if\r\ntheir practicability was settled.\r\n\r\nAs to poetry, the reader will be surprised to hear, that Russian\r\ncritics themselves think the short-lived flower of the Russian soil\r\nalready in danger of fading; the productiveness of their poets being\r\nalready apparently on the decline. No genius has risen as a rival to\r\nPushkin. Alexander Pushkin, born 1799, showed his uncommon talents\r\nearly; he was educated at one of the imperial Institutes, and was in\r\nthe service of the government; when an Ode to Liberty, written in too\r\nbold a spirit, induced the emperor Alexander to banish him from St.\r\nPetersburg. He obtained however employment in the southern provinces\r\nof Russia; and life in these wild and poetical regions was more\r\nfavourable to the development of his genius, than that of the capital\r\never could have been. All his poetry bears strong testimony to Byron's\r\ninfluence; but he would be wrongly judged if taken as a mere imitator\r\nof that great poet. His poetical tales, _Ruslan and Ludmilla_, from\r\nthe heroic times of Russia; _The Prisoner of the Mountains_, a\r\nCaucasian scene (1823): and the _Fountain of Baktshiserai,_ a Tartar\r\nStory (1824); have each great beauties. The emperor Nicholas, when at\r\nMoscow on the occasion of his coronation, recalled him, and showed\r\nhimself his patron. He made him one of the historiographers of the\r\nempire: and the archives were opened to him. The effect on the whole\r\nwas not favourable to the poet's genius. The first production after\r\nhis return to fashionable life was 'Eugene Onegin,' a novel in\r\nverse, the life of _un homme blasé_. Of this Byronic tendency, his\r\nPrisoner, and a great many of his small poems likewise, bear strong\r\nevidence. And it is this feature chiefly, which, in turn, Pushkin's\r\nfollowers and imitators have seized upon; for instance, Lermontof. It\r\nis painful to see, how, instead of the freshness, the vigour, the\r\njoyfulness, which we ought to meet in the representatives of a young\r\nand rising literature, resting on the foundation of a rich,\r\nuncorrrupted, original language, we find in them the ennui, the\r\ndissatisfaction, and the indifference of a set of _roués_ disgusted\r\nwith life. It seems as if after having emptied the cup of the vanities\r\nof the world to the very dregs, this world, which has nothing left for\r\ntheir enjoyment, is despised by them; unfortunately, however, without\r\nhaving educated their minds for a better one. In his later\r\nproductions, especially in his _Boris Godunof_, a drama, which may be\r\nrather called a tragical historical picture than a regular tragedy,\r\nPushkin showed a more elevated mind, and a more objective way of\r\nviewing things. His last work, we believe, was his _Istorija Bunta_,\r\nHistory of the Insurrection of Pugatshef; no noble struggle for\r\nliberty, but a mere mutiny. He died in St. Petersburg in 1835, a short\r\ntime after a marriage of choice and inclination; in a duel occasioned\r\nby a fit of jealousy, maliciously provoked by some of the courtiers.\r\n\r\nOther successful lyrical poets of this period are, Chomiakof,\r\nBaratinski, N. Jazikof, A. Timofeyef, Benedictof, Sokolovski, A.\r\nPodolinski, Lucian Jakubovitch, A. Ilitshevski, etc. Several ladies\r\nalso have recently mounted the Pegasus. A Princess Volkonski, a\r\nCountess Rostoptshin, a Miss Teplef, are favourably mentioned; as are\r\nalso Anna Bunin and a Mrs. Pawlof, the latter as a happy translator. A\r\nMrs. Helene Han, who writes under the name of Zeneide B., is compared\r\nto George Sand. Nor must we forget two natural poets so called, that\r\nis, men from the people, who write verses; one named Alipanof, born\r\na serf, and the other Kolzof. The lyric poets enumerated in the last\r\nperiod are all mostly still alive and continue to write.\r\n\r\nThe very limited productiveness of the Russian poets is however a very\r\nstriking and discouraging feature. While in the animated forest of\r\nGerman poetry, even during the most trying struggles of the times, a\r\nfull chorus of songs and ballads resounds from every branch, we hear\r\nfrom Russian groves only solitary voices, and these voices seem to be\r\nexhausted almost as soon as they are heard. A volume of twenty sheets\r\nis in general considered in Russia as quite a respectable collection.\r\nPushkin is almost the only one of their poets, whose very thoughts\r\nwere verses.\r\n\r\nThe more exuberant, however, do we find the productiveness of some of\r\ntheir dramatic writers. Polevoi, whom we have mentioned as the editor\r\nof the \"Telegraph,\" and as a keen critic who exerted great influence,\r\npoured out a whole flood of tragedies and comedies. To judge from the\r\napplause with which they were received on the stage, the writer was\r\nmore successful in this branch, than in his historical enterprises.\r\nBesides him, Lenski, Koni, Feodorof, and others, as well as numerous\r\ntranslators, furnished provision for the stage. The most respectable\r\ntalent was shown by Kukolnik; of whom his countrymen have a very high\r\nidea, but to whom foreign critics assign rather a lyric than a\r\ndramatic genius. The reverential attachment of Russians to their\r\nmonarch is exhibited in the very titles chosen by several dramatic\r\npoets. One of Kukolnik's dramas bears the rather prolix name, \"The\r\nhand of the Almighty shelters the Tzar.\" A piece of Glinka is called,\r\n\"Our Life for the Tzar,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe popular poetry which is scattered over all Slavic countries, has\r\nat last received the attention due to it. That of Russia is not so\r\nearly as that of some other branches of the same family; with the\r\nexception however of certain songs for harvest, weddings, festivals,\r\nfunerals, and some other like verses, sung or recited on certain\r\nstated occasions. There are among them some, which in their most\r\nessential portions are derived from pagan times. The Ukraine, and\r\nindeed Malo-Russia in general, and all the regions where Ruthenian\r\ntribes have settled, are particularly rich in popular poetry. Valuable\r\nmiscellaneous collections have been made by Prince Tzertelef,\r\nMaximovitch, Sacharof, by the Polish literati Bielowski and\r\nSiemienski, Bodianski, etc.[45]\r\n\r\nTo the philological works enumerated on page 84, we may add the\r\nfollowing productions of the present period: Brosset, on the\r\nLiterature and Language of Armenia and Georgia;[46] also the\r\nDictionaries of these languages by Chodubashef and Tschubinof, the\r\nlatter (Georgian or Grusinian) the first which was ever published; a\r\nChinese grammar by the priest Hyacinth, who prepared likewise a\r\nhistory of China some years ago, which we must suppose has been\r\npublished. A new Turkish dictionary was published in 1830 by Rhasis.\r\nPrince Alexander Handsheri prepared another of French, Arabic,\r\nTurkish, and Persian; in aid of which the Sultan subscribed for 200\r\ncopies. Sjogren, an academician, known by his Studies on the Finnish\r\nLanguage and Literature, devoted himself in connection with the latter\r\nto the Caucasian idioms, and published the results in the Transactions\r\nof the Academy. A Turco-Tartar grammar was written by Kasembeg, a\r\nTartar by birth, but educated in European Russia, and professor of\r\nthose languages at the university of Kazan.\r\n\r\nIn the different departments of natural science, although the Russians\r\nmay be still called beginners, their progress has recently been\r\nimmense. This has resulted in a great measure from the judicious plan\r\nof the government, in sending out annually a certain number of young\r\nmen to study at German universities. Philosophy as a science was\r\nformerly despised, and considered as the exclusive property of German\r\npedants and bookworms;[47] but since German philosophy has seemed to\r\ntake a more practical turn, it has begun to excite more interest. The\r\ngovernment, which in the first affright after the conspiracy of 1825,\r\nhad abolished all the professorships of philosophy, began to relax;\r\nand went even so far as to send young men to Germany for these\r\nstudies, and to re-establish the chairs in several of the Russian\r\nuniversities. It was, however, still regarded as a _dangerous_\r\nscience; and the learning which some young clergymen acquired in\r\nit--Golubinski, Gabriel, and above all Sidonski--was carefully\r\nwatched, and proved of little value to the public.\r\n\r\nIn regard to periodical literature, the number of _political_ journals\r\nis of course very small. That which most highly extols the merits and\r\nexploits of the Russians is always considered as the best, and is most\r\npatronized by the government and the nation. In Russia the _praise_ of\r\none's country and _love_ for it are regarded as synonymous ideas. The\r\nliterary journals, most of which are of a miscellaneous character, are\r\nmore in number, and are generally conducted with some critical talent.\r\nThose of a purely scientific character are rarely sustained longer\r\nthan a few years; for instance, the very valuable Bibliographical\r\nJournal, edited by P. Köppen in 1825-26. The ephemeral race of\r\n_Annuals_, those vehicles of superficial taste and knowledge, early\r\ntook broad possession of the Russian Parnassus. In the year 1839,\r\neight hundred and eighty different works were published in Russia; of\r\nwhich seventy-three only were translations. The number of journals\r\nand periodicals, which in general are quite thick pamphlets, amounted\r\nonly to fifty-three. In 1842 those latter had increased to one hundred\r\nand thirty-nine; nearly three times as many as in the former year. Of\r\nthese 98 were in the Russian language, 22 in German, 8 in French, 1 in\r\nItalian, 3 in Polish, and 3 in Lettonian.[48]\r\n\r\nIn a recent work on Russian literature, by F. Otto,[49] the Lexicon of\r\nauthors subjoined comprises about 250 names; and the English\r\ntranslator speaks of having seen a list of nearly _twelve hundred_\r\nmore in the author's hands. We are compelled to regard this last\r\nstatement with some distrust; especially when we perceive, that among\r\nthe names printed in the Lexicon, at least _thirty_ are Germans and\r\nPoles who wrote _on_ Russian matters, but not _in_ Russian. It is also\r\nsingular to find among Russian _authors_, not only the Grand-duke\r\nConstantine of Kief, because he was a _patron_ of science, and first\r\ncaused the Old Slavonic Bible to be printed; but also even the old\r\ntraditional bard Bojan, mentioned in the ancient epic of Igor![50]\r\n\r\nThe recent movements in Europe have of course built up still higher\r\nthe Chinese wall which surrounds the Russian empire. Even in\r\nanticipation of them, the government had been seized with a new shock\r\nof fear; and attempted to shut out the intrusive new lights. This was\r\nindicated by several strong and very unpopular measures; among which\r\nwe may here mention, that travellers in foreign countries were called\r\nhome, and the number of students at each university was suddenly\r\nlimited to _three hundred_.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to enlarge on the distinguished merits which\r\nforeigners, and especially Germans, have acquired in relation to\r\nRussian history, statistics, etc. But their labours in relation to the\r\nlanguage, form a part of the literature to which they were devoted;\r\nand cannot of course be separated from the works of native writers.\r\nThe most distinguished names in this department are again Germans,\r\nviz. Heym, Vater, Tappe, Puchmayer, etc. The catalogue of elementary\r\nworks upon the Russian language, is too long to be inserted here; we\r\nlimit ourselves therefore to those only which are written in English,\r\nand the best in German and French. The English grammars and\r\ndictionaries of the Russian, are indeed so few, that an American or\r\nEnglishman would hardly succeed in acquiring a full knowledge of the\r\nlanguage, except through the medium of the German and French. The\r\nfirst Russian Grammar, however, that was ever printed, was published\r\nat Oxford. We give the titles of this and of the other principal\r\ngrammars and lexicons of the Russian language, in the note below.[51]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Also called Ivan I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See more on this subject in Part IV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See Schaffarik, _Geschichte_ p. 178, note 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Sviatoslav, Jaropulk, Jaroslav, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The chronographic manuscript in which the above poem was\r\nfound, entitled _Slowa o polku Igora_, literally _Speech on Igor's\r\nExpedition_, is said to have also contained several other pieces of\r\npoetry.

The literature of neither of them has as yet\r\ntreasures enough, to renounce willingly the claims which their mutual\r\nand naturally rich though uncultivated language gives to the one upon\r\nthe productions of the other. We now proceed, in a short historical\r\nintroduction, to show the origin of this separation; after making a\r\nfew preliminary remarks on the character of the language as a whole,\r\nunaffected by its division into different dialects, not more distinct\r\nindeed from each other than is the case in almost every other living\r\nidiom.\r\n\r\nThe Servian language is spoken by about five millions of people. It\r\nextends, with some slight variations of dialect, over the Turkish and\r\nAustrian provinces of Servia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, and\r\nDalmatia; over Slavonia and the eastern part of Croatia. It is further\r\nthe property of several thousands, who emigrated from their own\r\ncountry on account of the Turkish oppression, and are now settled as\r\ncolonists along the south-western bank of the Danube, from Semlin to\r\nSt. André near Buda. The southern sky, and the beauties of natural\r\nscenery existing throughout nearly all these regions, so favourable in\r\ngeneral to the development of poetical genius, appear also to have\r\nexerted a happy influence on the language. While it yields to none\r\nof the other Slavic dialects in richness, clearness, and precision,\r\nit far surpasses all of them in euphony. The Servian has often been\r\ncalled the _Italian_ among the other Slavic idioms. Comparisons of\r\nthis sort are always superficial, and tend to give a false view of the\r\ncharacter of an object. Be this as it may, the Servian is decidedly\r\nthe most melodious of the Slavic languages, rich in vowels, and\r\nabounding alike in soft and powerful accents. The accumulation of\r\nconsonants, with which the other dialects are so often reproached, is\r\nrarely, if ever, to be met with in Servian. The reader may compare the\r\nServian _wetar_ with _wjtr_, _krilo_ with _krzydlo_ or _skrzydlo, pao_\r\nwith _padl_, etc. Those who ascribe this mildness of the Servian\r\nlanguage to the Italian neighbourhood of Dalmatia, forget that the\r\neastern Servians are remote from Italy. It is true that the dialects\r\nof these latter are at the same time full of Turcisms; but these are\r\nmere excrescences, which may easily be removed without touching the\r\nessential structure of the language. The Turkish words adopted into\r\nthe Servian, are mostly nouns, and verbs derived from them; and may\r\nnaturally be explained by their political relation to the Turks during\r\nso many centuries. If we may confide in a remark of the profound\r\nphilologist J. Grimm, _some_ foreign ingredients are useful and even\r\nnecessary to languages. They act as a cement, and fill up gaps; nay,\r\nthey not seldom serve to give to the expression colouring and pliancy.\r\nThe attention of the civilized world, although directed at the\r\nbeginning of the present century to the Servians and their heroic\r\nstruggles, has only recently been excited in respect to their\r\nlanguage; and this through the efforts of a single individual. We\r\nshall have more to say on this point in the section devoted to the\r\nliterature of the Servians of the eastern church.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Illyricum comprised all the countries situated between the\r\nAdriatic and the Black Sea, and along the Danube and Save.[2]\r\nTowards the middle of the seventh century, we find this vast country\r\nmostly occupied by a Slavic people of one and the same race,\r\nalternately called Bulgarians, Croatians, and Servians. We find also\r\nsix kingdoms gradually established by them: Bulgaria, Servia, Bosnia\r\n(Rama), Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia; some of them powerful and of\r\ngreat influence in their time, but now and long since sunk into ruin,\r\nand existing only as Turkish or Austrian provinces. An impenetrable\r\nnight rests on the early history of these regions; and if the\r\njudicious criticism of modern philologists has thrown comparatively\r\nsome light on this general topic, still, their investigations have\r\nbeen of little consequence for the history of the language. All that\r\nit concerns us to note here, is, that as early as the seventh century\r\na part of these nations were already Christians, converted by Romish\r\npriests. Among the remainder, Christianity as taught by Greek\r\nmissionaries found a welcome reception in the eighth and ninth\r\ncenturies, and soon was fully established. The oriental Servians had\r\nthe chief seat of their power in the present Turkish province of\r\nSerf-Vilayeti; and governed by princes called _Shupans_, we see them\r\nin a constant war of resistance against the Greek emperors, and during\r\nseveral centuries also against the powerful Khans of Bulgaria; now\r\nconquered, subjugated, destroyed almost to annihilation, but\r\nrecovering with effort and rising again in power, with such energy as\r\nto enable them under the great Tzar, Stephan Dushan, not only to hold\r\nall their neighbours in awe, but to take a menacing position towards\r\nByzantium itself, and dictate conditions of peace to the imploring\r\nenvoys of that proud imperial court. But this brilliant point of\r\nServian glory, which even now after five hundred years still lives in\r\nthe hearts of the people, and is the subject of a thousand legends and\r\nsongs, was only a meteor. It vanished in almost the same moment that\r\nit appeared. Stephan's immediate successors, enfeebled by their\r\ndomestic dissensions, sunk under the superior forces of the Turks, who\r\nhad broken into Europe thirty-four years earlier. They soon became the\r\nconquerors of the Servians, though not without fierce and bloody\r\nstruggles; and they still remain their masters and oppressors.[3]\r\n\r\nThe western Servians were early divided into small states, some of\r\nwhich adopted an aristocratic republican form of constitution. Among\r\nthese, only the republic of Ragusa requires to be mentioned here, as\r\nthe cradle of the Dalmatian branch of Servian literature. The local\r\nsituation of these western states made them dependent on Hungary; and\r\nthus Croatia, Slavonia, Dalmatia, sometimes under the title of\r\nkingdoms, and now as dukedoms, became at length mere provinces of that\r\nlarger kingdom, and ultimately of the Austrian empire. Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, which form the boundary between the Servians of the East\r\nand West, were subject to the influence of both; and are to the\r\npresent day divided in religion and in language.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Literature of the Servians of the Oriental or Greek Church_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever small the circuit of country, properly called Servia, is in\r\nproportion to the whole extent over which the southern Slavi are\r\nspread, the name of Servians nevertheless appears to modern\r\nphilologists as the best adapted for being employed as the common name\r\nof them all. Dobrovsky thinks it even appropriate to become the\r\ngeneral appellation for all Slavic nations. Although of obscure\r\nderivation, it is at least sufficiently ascertained that it is of pure\r\nSlavic origin; glorious associations are attached to it; it is\r\nmoreover still a living name, while the learned appellation of\r\n_Illyrians_, formerly more in use, is dead; and that of _Bosnians_,\r\npreferred by some Dalmatian writers, rests upon no satisfactory\r\ngrounds. The name of Servians, however, was never, till recently,\r\napplied to the Dalmatians. It is indeed still rejected by themselves;\r\nand they continue to call themselves _Illyrians_.\r\n\r\nUnder the present head, besides the Servians proper, of whom great\r\nnumbers have emigrated in early times to Hungary, are also strictly\r\ncomprised the Bosnians, the greater portion of the inhabitants of\r\nHerzegovina, the Montenegrins or Czernogortzi, and the Slavonians of\r\nthe Greek Church. These all use the same language and alphabet; but\r\nthe four latter have no distinct literature, except some collections\r\nof popular poetry.\r\n\r\nThe literature of the eastern Servians, the result of their\r\nintellectual life as a nation, does not yet date back a hundred years;\r\nnay, if regarded from another point of view, it is not yet forty years\r\nold. Up to that time, all the Servians belonging to the Greek Church,\r\nnotwithstanding the honourable example of Russia to the contrary, had\r\nwritten in the Old or Church Slavonic; or, in more modern times, in a\r\nlanguage mixed up from this latter and several other dialects.\r\nSchaffarik remarks, that out of about 400 Servian books printed\r\nbetween the years 1742, or more properly 1761, and 1826, about one\r\neighth part are written in Old Slavic; another eighth in the common\r\ndialect of the people; while all the rest vary between these two in\r\ninnumerable shades and degrees.[4] This eighth part written in\r\nordinary Servian, and essentially the same language which the\r\nDalmatians and the greater part of the Croats speak, are all of very\r\nrecent date. Indeed, with the exception of a single writer,\r\nObradovitch, who found no immediate followers, the dialect of the\r\npeople was in general despised by the clergy and those who laid claim\r\nto education, as being wholly unfit for books, and (as Vuk\r\nStephanovitch strongly expresses himself) only proper for \"cowherds\r\nand swineherds.\" How the once flourishing literature of Ragusa could\r\never have sunk into oblivion to such a degree, is hardly to be\r\nconceived; as indeed, in general, the division so sharply drawn in\r\nrespect to literature between those two branches of the same people,\r\nwhile they were still bound together by the strong ties of one and the\r\nsame language of common life and in part also of the same government,\r\nbelongs among the most remarkable facts in literary history.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient document of the Servian Old Slavic language, is out\r\nof the middle of the thirteenth century, viz. the Hexaemeron of\r\nBasilius, with a preface by John, exarch of Bulgaria. Then follow the\r\n\"Acts of the Apostles,\" written by the hieromonach Damian, A.D. 1324.\r\nOf higher historical importance are some secular writings from the end\r\nof the thirteenth to the middle of the fourteenth century, viz. a\r\ngenealogical register of the Servian princes and the events of their\r\nreigns, called _Radoslov_, written by archbishop Daniel; a similar\r\nwork called the _Tzarostavnick_; and above all the statutes of Tzar\r\nDushan the Powerful, A.D. 1336-56. These statutes, dated from the year\r\n6837, or A.D. 1349, not only afford us a good survey of the\r\nconstitution of the Servian kingdom, but are a remarkable contribution\r\nto the history of its moral state at that early period, The\r\nphilanthropist cannot but perceive, with satisfaction, the rare union\r\nthat reigns in these laws of stern justice and true Christian\r\nbenevolence, attempting to alleviate those evils which it was not in\r\nthe power of an individual to abolish,--thehardships of slavery, the\r\ninsecurity of property peculiar to those barbarous times, and those\r\nrash and bloody acts of self-protection, which are preferred by the\r\npowerful all over the world to the slower steps of avenging justice.\r\nIt is indeed remarkable to observe, how these statutes not only\r\ncounteracted the grosser vices and crimes, (which for the most part is\r\nthe only object of laws,) but also favoured the characteristic virtues\r\nof the times, for instance hospitality. One statute ordains, that when\r\na traveller asked for night-quarters at the dwelling of a landed\r\nproprietor and was not admitted, he had the right to take lodgings in\r\nhis village wherever he pleased; and did he lose any thing, not his\r\nhost, but the proprietor who had refused to harbour him, was bound to\r\nremunerate the loss.[5]\r\n\r\nThe monks of this and the following centuries must have written a\r\ngreat deal; as is proved by the many manuscripts that still lie\r\naccumulated in the numerous Servian and Macedonian monasteries,--the\r\nmere remnant of those which perished in the long tempests of bloody\r\nwars and desolating conflagrations. About fifty years after the\r\ninvention of printing, some of the church books from time to time were\r\npublished in Servia and Syrmia. The earliest Servian print extant is\r\nfrom the year 1493, viz. an Octateuch, published at Zenta in\r\nHerzegovina. In Russia they did not begin to print until sixty years\r\nlater. In 1552 the Gospels were printed in Belgrade; in 1562 another\r\nedition in Negromont. But these faint signs of life soon became\r\nextinct; and we hear no longer of the least trace of literature among\r\nthe Servians of the Turkish empire. Among the Austrian Servians also,\r\nliterature seems to have been equally dead; with the exception of a\r\nHistory of Servia, written and left in manuscript by George\r\nBrankovitch, the last despot of that country, towards the close of the\r\nseventeenth century. A genealogical work published by Dshefarovitch at\r\nVienna in 1742, had to be engraved, for the want of proper types. In\r\nthe year 1755, under the reign of Maria Theresa, when some attention\r\nbegan to be paid to the schools of her Illyrian provinces, the\r\narchbishop of Carlovitz was compelled to have Smotrisky's Grammar[6]\r\nprinted in Walachia, because no Slavic types were to be found in the\r\nwhole Austrian empire. Some years afterwards, A.D. 1758, a private\r\nSlavic press was founded at Venice. In Austria, Cyrillic-Slavonic\r\nbooks could not be printed earlier than A.D. 1771, when a printing\r\noffice was established at Vienna; the monopoly of which for all\r\nSlavo-Servian scientific works throughout the empire, was given to the\r\nuniversity of Buda. From this one point, therefore, the whole literary\r\ncultivation of the Servians of the oriental church in the Austrian\r\nempire, could alone proceed.[7]\r\n\r\nAfter the partial revival of Servian literature in 1758, a\r\nconsiderable number of works were composed; and there are among them\r\nnot a few, which, notwithstanding the mixed and unsettled idiom in\r\nwhich they are written, attest the general capacity of the nation, and\r\nmay serve as imperfect specimens of the mass of talent buried there.\r\nAmong the historical writers, we must name above all J. Raitch. He\r\nwrote on many different subjects; and also left behind him a whole\r\nlibrary of theological manuscripts. His 'History of the Slavic\r\nNations'[8] has given him a lasting reputation. Other historical\r\nwriters of some merit, are, Kengelatz, Magarashevitch, Julinatz,\r\nSolaritch.[9] Writers on different subjects of natural philosophy and\r\nmedicine, are, Orphelin, Stoïkovitch, Beritch, Jankovitch, P.\r\nHadshitch, etc. On statistics and geography the above-mentioned\r\nSolaritch, Vuitch, Bulitch, Popovitch, and others. In the department\r\nof theology, we hardly meet with a single book of a doctrinal\r\ncharacter; but there are quite a number on ethics. The principal\r\nwriters of the language, therefore, may perhaps be more properly\r\narranged under the heads of philosophy (comprehending logic),\r\nrhetoric, ethics, etc. as Obradovitch, Raitch, Terlaitch, Lazarevitch,\r\nVuitch, Davidovitch, Masovitch, etc.[10]\r\n\r\nPoetry and belles-lettres being more dependent on the state of the\r\nlanguage than purely scientific works, we can proceed no further,\r\nwithout first making our readers acquainted with the recent\r\ninnovations of a few patriotic individuals.\r\n\r\nIt was Dositheï Obradovitch, born A.D. 1739 in the Banat of Temeswar,\r\nwho first among the eastern Servians ventured to write books in the\r\ndespised language of the country. The fortunes of this person are, in\r\nseveral respects, of uncommon interest. Brought up in a monastic\r\nschool, he became monk when he was only fourteen years old. After\r\nseveral years of severe struggles, he fled. For twenty-five years he\r\ntravelled over all Europe; and then returned to his comparatively\r\nbarbarous native land, where he died in 1811, as inspector of the\r\nschools, and the instructor of the children of the celebrated Kara\r\nGeorge. He left several works.\r\n\r\nA far greater influence, however, has been exerted on Servian\r\nliterature by Dem. Davidovitch and Vuk Stephanovitch Karadshitch, who\r\nhave not only followed the same literary course, but were the first to\r\ndefend both theoretically and practically the principle, that the\r\nServians ought to _write_ as they _speak_. Their boldness met with\r\nstrong and decided opposition from the old school; and the contest and\r\nrivalry which have been the consequence, although tending for a time\r\nto prevent the progress of the good cause, cannot but have, ere long,\r\nbeneficial results, by exciting the minds of the people to a higher\r\nactivity than they have had until then occasion to exert.\r\n\r\nDavidovitch published from 1814 to 1822 a Servian newspaper in Vienna,\r\nnot exclusively of a political character, by which he intended to\r\ndiffuse information on various subjects; the first undertaking of the\r\nkind in his language. His influence however is not confined to the\r\nlanguage alone; as secretary of Prince Milosh, then at the head of the\r\nServians, his influence on the general cultivation of his countrymen\r\nwas very decided.\r\n\r\nVuk Stephanovitch Karadshitch, born 1786 in Turkish Servia, is the\r\nauthor of the first Oriental-Servian grammar and dictionary; and in\r\nthe arrangement of the former has manifested the true spirit of a\r\ngenuine grammarian. Besides these he has written several works of\r\nvalue, a biography of Prince Milosh, a series of annuals, a volume on\r\nthe Proverbs, and idiomatic phrases of the Servians, etc.[11] But the\r\nbest proof which he could give of the beauty, richness, and\r\nperfectibility of the vulgar Servian dialect, is his Collection of\r\nthe Servian popular Songs, in four volumes, comprising nevertheless\r\nonly about the fourth or fifth part of the similar treasures hidden\r\namong the mountains of his country. In making this collection, he very\r\njudiciously wrote down only those songs which he had himself caught\r\nfrom the lips of the Servian peasantry. There had already been a\r\nrumour among the literati of Europe, for more than fifty years, of the\r\nbeauty and singularity of the Illyrian national songs, founded mostly\r\non the communications of Italian travellers and the citations of\r\nDalmatian dictionaries. Herder, in his valuable Collection of popular\r\nPoetry, gave two historical fragments from the work of a Dalmatian\r\nclergyman, A. Cacich.[12] Goethe also has a beautiful tale, taken from\r\nAbbate Fortis' Travels among the Morlachians. Both translated by means\r\nof the French; and although this double translation could not possibly\r\ndo justice to the originals, they were sufficiently admired. But when\r\nVuk's collection appeared, and a part of its contents was made\r\nintelligible to the civilized world by a translation attempted by the\r\nauthor of this work, imperfect and deficient as any translation of\r\npopular poetry must necessarily ever be, the public and the critics\r\nwere nevertheless alike struck with the strong expression of the high\r\nand incomparable beauties of nature. All that the other Slavic\r\nnations, or the Germans, the Scotch, and the Spaniards, possess of\r\npopular poetry, can at the utmost be compared with the lyrical part of\r\nthe Servian songs, called by them _female_ songs, because they are\r\nsung only by females and youths; but the long epic extemporized\r\ncompositions, by which a peasant bard, sitting in a large circle of\r\nother peasants, in unpremeditated but perfectly regular and harmonious\r\nverse, celebrates the heroic deeds of their ancestors or\r\ncotemporaries, has no parallel in the whole history of literature\r\nsince the days of Homer.[13]\r\n\r\nVuk Stephanovitch Karadshitc,[14] in his successful attempts to\r\nreduce a language, which hitherto had been merely an unwritten dialect\r\nof the common people, to certain general rules and principles, had,\r\nbesides the more philosophical part of the work, also to adapt the\r\nSlavonic alphabet to his purpose. The mixed and unregulated language,\r\nwhich up to his time had been employed, had been written alternately\r\nwith the Old Slavonic and the Russian letters. To the Russian\r\nlanguage, with its multitude of sounds, the latter is perfectly\r\nsuitable; in Servian, however, several letters could be easily spared;\r\nwhile others had to be added. Some change of the alphabet seemed\r\ntherefore necessary. As those Servians among whom Vuk was born, and\r\namong whom chiefly he had gathered the treasures of remarkable poetry,\r\nwhich serve as so beautiful a base to their young literature, all\r\nbelonged to the Greek or Oriental Church, he seems never to have\r\nthought of the possibility of adopting the Latin alphabet, which had\r\nalready served for several centuries for the once flourishing\r\nliterature of their Catholic brethren, who spoke essentially the same\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nWe are ready to acknowledge that the Slavic alphabet, as arranged by\r\nVuk, is better adapted to express the sounds of the Slavic languages,\r\nthan the Latin; it is at once simpler and richer. But we nevertheless\r\ncannot help regretting, that he did not yield to the various reasons,\r\nwhich on the other side spoke in favour of the Latin alphabet. It was\r\nalready used by some millions for the same language, and had been so\r\nfor centuries. It would have given a _history_ to the young Servian\r\nLiterature built on the solid foundation of that of Ragusa. It had\r\nbeen, with the exception of the Russians, adopted by all the other\r\nSlavic nations. It would have indeed estranged him, seemingly, from\r\nhis nearer countrymen, who made the most passionate objections against\r\nhis innovations, even as they were; but as they, at any rate, had to\r\ngo to Austria for a literary education, this opposition would probably\r\nnot have lasted longer than it will last now. There was some fear,\r\nthat, with the Roman alphabet, the Roman chair would try to get\r\npossession of their church; but those were not the times of Rome's\r\npower; and the Turkish patronage seemed to secure them against such\r\narrogance. One thing is certain. Instead of strengthening for ever the\r\nartificial wall of separation between the two classes of\r\nIllyrico-Servians, it would have undermined that which already\r\nexisted; and Vuk, by his strong philosophical-grammatical talent,\r\nwould soon have gained influence enough on the Illyrico-Dalmatian\r\nliterature to mend the imperfections of their orthography, and to\r\ninduce the Croats and Servians to give up their capricious varieties.\r\nThe many detached parts of the products of Illyrico-Servian intellect\r\nwould have grown into one great whole; and would have become at least\r\naccessible to foreigners; who, puzzled by all these varieties of\r\nletters and forms of writing, lose the courage to penetrate into a\r\nstructure where they meet so much confusion at the very door. Indeed,\r\nwhether they turn to the eastern or to the western branch of the\r\nSouthern Slavi, they find equal individual and provincial anarchy; a\r\nstate of things which the latter at least have taken great pains to\r\namend.\r\n\r\nVuk published at Vienna, in 1824, the Gospel of St. Luke, as a\r\n'Specimen of a translation of the New Testament into Servian.' What\r\npart he had in the version printed at Leipsic by the British and\r\nForeign Bible Society, and now circulated among the Servians, we are\r\nunable to say.[15] Modern educated Servian poets, upon whose writings\r\nthe very general interest which the national popular poetry has\r\nexcited, and no doubt also their own consciousness of its power, have\r\nhad a favourable influence, are the following: Lucian Mushitzky,\r\nbishop of Karlstadt, a writer in many departments, and the author of\r\nodes and other lyrical pieces, all of them highly esteemed by his\r\ncountrymen; Milovan Vidakovitch, Mich. Vitkovitch, J. Popovitch, G.\r\nKovatzevitch, etc.\r\n\r\nMore generally known is Simeo Milutinovitch, the author of several\r\nsmall volumes of poetry, and of a larger epic poem entitled\r\n_Serbianka_, which describes the Servian war of 1812. In 1837 he\r\npublished an historical work on Servia during the years 1813-15. Both\r\nthese latter narratives are valuable, as he himself had been an\r\neye-witness of many of the events described; had acted as secretary to\r\nCzerny George, who could neither write nor read; and was afterwards\r\nalso employed by Prince Milosh.[16]\r\n\r\nTwo interesting collections of the popular poetry extant among the\r\ninhabitants of Montenegro and Herzegovina were published in the course\r\nof a few years by Tshubar Tshoikovitch; one of them edited by J.\r\nMilowuk, himself a modern Servian writer of praiseworthy activity; the\r\nother by the collector himself.[17]\r\n\r\nLast, although not least, the present Vladika or bishop of Montenegro,\r\nmust be named among the modern Servian poets. The constitution of this\r\nlittle mountain state, half warlike, half patriarchal, is an anomaly\r\nin the system of European state governments in general. They form a\r\ncommunity of about 20,000 families, pressed into the valleys and\r\nscattered along the slopes of the dark mountain ranges between\r\nCattaro, Herzegovina, Bosnia, and Albania; covering a surface of 80 or\r\n90 geographical square leagues. Hitherto they have been permitted to\r\nenjoy a perfect independence in respect to both their great\r\nneighbours, Austria and Turkey. They look up only to the emperor of\r\nRussia as a kind of liege lord; but more in his quality of Head of the\r\nSlavic-Greek Church, than in that of a powerful sovereign. They stand\r\nunder the rule of a Vladika or bishop; who, besides being their\r\nspiritual guide, is their chief judge and their leader in war; as\r\nalso, since 1832, exclusively their executive magistrate. Up to that\r\ntime they were accustomed to elect a _governor_; but he assumed too\r\nmuch power; and the post had become hereditary in the family of\r\nRadonich. They therefore dismissed him; and his functions were\r\nlikewise intrusted to the bishop.\r\n\r\nAlthough the office of the Vladika had been formerly purely elective;\r\nyet towards the close of the seventeenth century, through the\r\ninfluence of Vladika Daniel Petrovitch of Niegosh, it became\r\nhereditary in his own family; a member of which since that time has\r\nalways been appointed by the Russian emperor. As the Greek bishops\r\nbelong to the monastic clergy, who of course are not permitted to\r\nmarry,--while the secular clergy are _required_ to do so,--the\r\nsuccession goes in a collateral line. The present Vladika, Peter\r\nPetrovitch Niegosh, a man of uncommon size, handsome features,\r\nconsiderable talent, and a highly respected character, was partly\r\neducated in Russia. When his predecessor died,--a powerful man who had\r\nruled for fifty-three years, during which time he had led his flock to\r\nmany a bloody battle, and who was canonized as a saint by the present\r\nbishop,--this latter was appointed by the emperor Nicholas. But as he\r\nwas then only fifteen years old, Montenegro was governed by a sort of\r\nguardian; and the Vladika did not enter upon his office until he had\r\ncompleted his eighteenth year. The wisdom, the energy, the consistency\r\nin his improvements, which, he has displayed since that time,\r\nconstitute him, in connection with his youth, one of the most\r\nremarkable personages of our time. His chief aim seems to be to make\r\nMontenegro a member of the great civilized family of Europe, without\r\ndepriving her of her freedom and independence; and the firmness with\r\nwhich he proceeds further and further in a course, where he meets with\r\ndifficulties at every step, deserves praise and admiration.\r\n\r\nThe first circumstance which directed the attention of literary Europe\r\nto this remote corner, was a visit of the present king of Saxony, who\r\nin 1838 made a botanical excursion into those \"black mountains.\" [16]\r\nSince then, the celebrated Egyptian scholar, Wilkinson, has visited\r\nit; and this country is no longer closed against travelling artists.\r\nThe Vladika has naturally the manners of a gentleman; he is said to\r\nspeak French, and to understand German, Italian, and of course\r\nRussian. That he is considered as one of the best riflemen and\r\nhorsemen in his country, we cannot esteem as of much importance in a\r\nbishop; but he studies also the classics and translates the Iliad for\r\nhis own pleasure. His Servian poems seem mostly to have been written\r\non particular occasions. He addressed an ode to the king of Saxony\r\nafter his return to Dresden, which unfortunately not a person of the\r\nwhole court could understand; and the author of this volume, who\r\nhappened then to be at the \"German Athens,\" was applied to for a\r\ntranslation.[17] In their own productions, all these educated writers\r\nimitate the modern literature of other nations further advanced in\r\ncivilization, especially the Germans. Milutinovitch has even a tinge\r\nof their philosophy. There is no want of talent; but there is no\r\nnationality in them. Nothing of that wonderful amalgamation of the\r\nEast and the West; of mountaineer wildness and Christian principles;\r\nof barbarism and civilization; nothing of that interesting blending of\r\nAsia and Europe, which we feel entitled to expect from the poetry of\r\n_Servians_, who stand on the border between Muhammedanism and\r\nChristendom. Nothing which these educated writers have hitherto\r\nproduced, can be compared with the effusions of their old blind men,\r\nand of their peasant lads and girls, that is, their popular poetry.\r\n\r\nVuk's grammar, printed at Vienna 1818, before his dictionary, has\r\nsince been rendered accessible to other European nations by Grimm's\r\ntranslation. Another Servian grammar has been published in German, by\r\nSchaffarik. Vuk's judicious alphabetical arrangement and orthography,\r\nwe are sorry to say, have not been generally adopted; and the Russian\r\nalphabet is still partly in use, with a number of letters superfluous\r\nfor the Servian language, which has not the shades of sound they are\r\nmeant to denote.\r\n\r\nThe political movements in Servia, during the last twelve years, have\r\nof course been exceedingly injurious to the development of its infant\r\nliterature. While it seemed, under the energetic administration of\r\nprince Milosh, in a fair way of progress, the confused cries of war\r\nand insurrection since his abdication have drowned the modest voice of\r\nthe young muse. Of late, indeed, intelligence from that country has\r\nbeen so rare, that we are unable to give a picture of the present\r\nstate of things.\r\n\r\n2. _Literature of the Dalmatians or Illyrico-Servians of the Romish\r\nChurch_.\r\n\r\na) GLAGOLITIC LITERATURE.\r\n\r\nIt is not without some hesitation that we approach a region, into\r\nwhich we cannot penetrate without stepping through a border of perfect\r\ndarkness. We allude to the introduction of the Glagolitic alphabet;\r\nthe great antiquity of which, supported by numerous traditions and\r\nlegends, as well as by its venerable and almost hieroglyphic look,\r\nKopitar's recent investigations and discoveries have again made\r\nprobable; without, however, throwing any more light upon its origin.\r\n\r\nAs Christianity was first introduced into Dalmatia by Romish priests,\r\nthe Latin language was of course adopted for religious purposes. But\r\nso soon as the people became acquainted with the liturgy of Methodius\r\nin a language intelligible to them, this innovation met with such a\r\ngeneral and heartfelt welcome, that all the severe decrees of synods,\r\nnay, of the holy chair of Rome itself, were unable to stop its\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nEven more than a hundred and fifty years afterwards, when Methodius\r\nwas solemnly declared by pope Nicolas II. a heretic, and the Romish\r\nmass again introduced, the attachment to their own language was too\r\ndeeply rooted to be taken away at once. Hence the Old Slavic idiom,\r\nwith the pope's reluctant permission, continued to be the language of\r\nthe Church service. It appears, however, that the alphabet which their\r\npriests employed for writing their ecclesiastic documents, was not the\r\nsame with that used by other Slavi of the oriental church: but was of\r\na different character, and evidently _not_ derived from the Greek,\r\nwith the exception of a few letters. It was called the _Glagolitic._\r\n\r\n_Glagol_ signifies in Old Slavic _the word_ or rather _the verb_; but\r\nthe reason of the application of this term to the Illyrico-Servians of\r\nthe catholic communion (_Glagolitæ)_, and to the language of their\r\nsacred writings (_Glagolic_ or _Glagolitic_), has not yet been\r\nascertained; all that has as yet been asserted by Slavic philologians\r\nbeing mere hypothesis. The oldest monument known up to 1830. in which\r\nthese letters were extant, was a Psalter of A.D. 1220. This Psalter\r\nwas by tradition ascribed to St. Jerome himself, who was in general\r\ncalled the inventor of the Slavic, that is the _Glagolitic_ alphabet.\r\nAccording to a popular legend of the Dalmatians, this father, who was\r\na native of Illyria, also translated the whole Bible into the Slavic;\r\nbut it has been since clearly proved, that while (as is well known) he\r\ncorrected the old Latin version of the Bible, he yet never wrote a\r\nsingle line of Slavic.\r\n\r\nThe mystery, in which the origin of the Glagolitic was and still is\r\nburied, gave birth to the singular hypothesis already above\r\nmentioned.[18] The discovery however of several very ancient\r\nGlagolitic manuscripts, and especially of one which could be proved to\r\nbe older than the Council of Spalatro[19] destroyed it at once; but\r\nunfortunately, without clearing up the mystery either of its invention\r\nor of its introduction.\r\n\r\nAnother Glagolitic manuscript of some interest may be mentioned here.\r\nIt was generally known, that the kings of France were accustomed, at\r\ntheir coronation at Kheiras, to take the oath on a large book, called\r\n_Texte du Sacre_, bound in gold or gilding, and covered with unwrought\r\nprecious stones, which contained the Gospels written in some unknown\r\nhieroglyphic language. When in 1717 Tzar Peter I. visited Rheims, this\r\nbook was shown to him among other curiosities, and he exclaimed at\r\nonce: \"This is my own Slavonic!\" This view was soon spread among\r\nSlavic scholars. But the precious parchment was written in two\r\ncolumns, and in two languages. What idiom could the other be? The\r\nFrench, it is said, took it for Greek: more probably for Coptic. In\r\n1789, a learned English traveller, Thomas Ford Hill, was shown some\r\nGlagolitic manuscripts in the imperial library at Vienna; whereupon he\r\ndeclared without hesitation, that this was the mysterious writing of\r\nthe Rheims manuscript. Before the Vienna scholars, Dobner and Alter,\r\nthen at the head of Slavic matters, had time to investigate the matter\r\nfurther, the revolution broke out, and the precious document\r\ndisappeared. No trace was left of it; and for half a century the\r\npatriotic Slavic scholars supposed they had cause to lament the loss\r\nof a document of the very highest antiquity. It was conjectured that\r\nthe book had originally been brought to France by some Slavic\r\nprincess; for instance, by a princess of Kief, who is said to have\r\nbeen sent for by Henry I., son of Hugh Capet and king of France in the\r\nbeginning of the eleventh century. Application was made on the subject\r\nto Sylvestre de Sacy; whose report gave some hope, that the precious\r\nrelic might still be preserved. Search was made by Kopitar in Italy\r\nand at Paris, but all in vain. At last it was again found at Rheims by\r\nthe Russian scholar Stroyef;[20] who, however, seems not to have been\r\nacquainted with the Glagolitic writing, and therefore laid little\r\nstress on it. The volume was stripped of its costly ornaments, and had\r\ntherefore been the more easily recovered during the reign of Napoleon;\r\nwho endeavoured, as much as was in his power, to restore the spoils of\r\nthe revolution, while he himself filled Paris with the spoils of all\r\nother nations.\r\n\r\nThe librarian at Rheims, in order best to meet the numerous inquiries\r\nof Slavic scholars, caused a _fac simile_ of it to be taken; audit was\r\nfinally committed to the learned Kopitar's care. It was now\r\ndiscovered, that this long deplored document contained two\r\nunconnected portions of the Gospels; one in Cyrillic letters, the\r\nother, considerably longer, in Glagolitic; and both executed with\r\nremarkable calligraphic skill. The Glagolitic portion was marked with\r\nthe date 1395. It was written at Prague, and presented by the emperor\r\nCharles IV. to the Abbot of Emaus; with the injunction, that these\r\n_Evangelia_ should be chanted at mass; and the remark was added, that\r\nthe accompanying Cyrillic portion was written by St. Procopius with\r\nhis own hand. Procopius was one of the patron saints of Bohemia, who\r\ndied in 1053. How this valuable manuscript was finally removed to\r\nFrance, is still unexplained. At Rheims nothing further was known,\r\nthan that it had been presented by the Cardinal of Lorraine in A.D.\r\n1554. A rumour ascribed to the Cyrillic portion a Greek origin; the\r\nGlagolitic part was generally considered as a relic from St. Jerome's\r\nown library. This supposed immediate connection with two saints, may\r\nwell account for the reverence with which the book was treated in\r\nFrance.[21] A splendid edition of this work, under the patronage of\r\nthe emperor of Russia, was prepared by Kopitar, and appeared in 1843\r\nat Paris.[22]\r\n\r\nAlthough the use of the Slavic language was in a certain measure\r\nauthorized by the pope, yet the clergy of Dalmatia preferred\r\nunanimously the Latin for their theological and ecclesiastical\r\nwritings. The Glagolitic literature was therefore almost exclusively\r\nlimited to copies of the productions of their Cyrillic brethren. The\r\nGlagolitic letters had, however, the precedence of the Cyrillic\r\nalphabet, in respect to printing. The first printed Glagolitic missal,\r\nis of the year 1483; whilst the earliest work printed in the\r\nCyrillic letters is not older than A.D. 1491. In the sixteenth century\r\nbooks were printed at Zengh (Segna), at Fiume, at Venice, and at\r\nTubingen, with Glagolitie letters. In the year 1621, the emperor\r\nFerdinand II. presented the Propaganda with a font of Glagolitic\r\ntypes, which he obtained from Venice. Several improved breviaries and\r\nmissals have since been printed at Rome. In our day, this city\r\npossesses the only Glagolitic printing office in existence. On the\r\nDalmatian islands, books are still copied in manuscript, just as\r\nbefore the invention of printing.\r\n\r\nAmong the Dalmatian clergy, there were a few who united a real\r\ninterest for the preservation of their language and for science in\r\ngeneral. Raph. Levakovitch improved the breviary in 1648, in respect\r\nto language; the archbishop Vincenz Zmajevitch, ob. 1771, a great\r\npatron of the literature of his country, founded a hundred years later\r\na theological seminary in Zara. Matthias Caraman, on occasion of a new\r\nedition of the missal by the Propaganda in 1741, undertook a\r\nfundamental revision and correction of it. The Propaganda also founded\r\na Slavic professorship in the _Collegia Urbano_; and for the benefit\r\nof this Society a new translation of the whole Bible was resolved\r\nupon, which however has never been published. A notice of the\r\nexertions of the priest Rosa belongs rather to the history of\r\nDalmatian secular literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nb) SECULAR LITERATURE.\r\n\r\nIt is not certain at what time, nor by whom, the Latin letters were\r\nfirst adopted for the Servian language. The earliest teachers of the\r\noccidental portion of that people having been Romish priests, they of\r\ncourse used their own letters for writing such Slavic words or names\r\nas occasion required. The Latin alphabet probably came into use\r\nwithout any particular pains, long before the introduction of the\r\nGlagolitic letters. These, in their awkward hieroglyphic form, were\r\nlittle adapted to supersede the Latin forms. The example of the Poles\r\nand Bohemians could only encourage the first Dalmatian writers to\r\ncontinue in the same course; although each of these nations follows a\r\ndifferent system of pronouncing the same letters. The orthography of\r\nthe Dalmatians remained, however, for a long time entirely unsettled:\r\nand is so still in some measure. A greater difficulty arose from the\r\nabsurd practice of the Slavonians and Croatians, who, although\r\nspeaking and writing the same language, yet write and print it each\r\naccording to a different system of combination; thus limiting the\r\nperusal of their own scanty productions almost exclusively to the few\r\nreaders of their small provinces respectively, whilst the remainder of\r\ntheir countrymen are hardly able to understand them. This division,\r\nhowever, compels us likewise to separate in our sketch the literature\r\nof the Dalmatians proper, and that of the catholic Slavonians.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Literature of Dalmatia Proper_.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of the Italians exercised in very early times a\r\nhappy influence on the literature of the Dalmatians. The small\r\nrepublic of Ragusa, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, was\r\nat the zenith of its splendour and welfare. Celebrated Italians were\r\nteachers in her schools; and the persecuted Greeks, Lascaris,\r\nDemetrius Chalcondylas, Emanuel Marulus, and several others,\r\ncelebrated over all Europe for their learning, found an asylum within\r\nher walls. Thus the treasures of the classics and of the Italian\r\nmiddle ages became familiar to the noble youths of Ragusa, until, in\r\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century, poetry began to appear in a\r\nnational dress. The Italian influence remained strikingly visible.\r\nBlasius Darxich, Sigismund Menze, Mauro Vetranich, and Stephen Gozze\r\n(ob. 1576), are mentioned as the first Dalmatian poets. The latter\r\nwrote a comic epic, the _Dervishiade_, which met with great success. A\r\npoem of the same kind is _Jegyupka_, the Gipsy, by Andreas\r\nGiubronavich, printed at Venice 1559. Dominic Zlatarich (ob. 1608)\r\ntranslated Tasso and the Electra of Sophocles, and was himself a lyric\r\npoet.\r\n\r\nThe annals of this period, towards the end of the sixteenth century,\r\nreport likewise the name of a lady, Svietana Zuzerich, as an Illyrian\r\npoetess; called also Floria Zuzzeri, as an Italian poetess; for she\r\nwrote with success in both languages. Several other ladies followed\r\nthe example, as Lucrezia Bogashinovich, Katharina Pozzo di Sorgo, etc.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Ragusa enjoyed peace,\r\nand a degree of wealth and prosperity most favourable to high\r\nattainments in science and literature. The first Slavic theatre was\r\nfounded here, and the dramatic art seems to have been considered so\r\nhonourable, that even noblemen acted publicly; as is related of Junius\r\nPalmota, who died in 1657. The noble names of Palmota or Palmotich,\r\nGondola or Gondolich, for they appear alternately both in the Slavic\r\nand Italian form, are very frequent in Ragusian literature. Junius\r\nPalmota wrote tragedies; selecting his subjects principally from\r\nSlavic history. But his most esteemed production is a Slavic version\r\nof a great Latin epic on Christ, by M.H. Vita, which may be considered\r\nas a kind of precursor to Klopstock's Messiah. John Gondola, a\r\ndramatic writer before him, translated Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered;\r\nand left many lyrical poems.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1667, a horrible earthquake in a few moments destroyed the\r\nprosperity of the state for whole centuries. It was as if the genius\r\nof the Ragusian literature had been crushed under the ruins. From that\r\nperiod we find all that relates to literature in a rapid decline. The\r\ncatastrophe itself, however, furnished the poets with a new subject.\r\nIn the same year, N. Bonus published a poem entitled, The city of\r\nRagusa to her Rulers; and Jacob Palmota (ob. 1680) wrote an elegiac\r\npoem, The renovated Ragusa. But the most interesting production of\r\nthis period is a collection of national songs, published by the\r\nFranciscan monk, And. Cacich Miossich.[23] This work, although\r\nexecuted with little critical taste or judgment, and disfigured by\r\nmany interpolations, might have given to the literary world a\r\nforetaste of the treasures, which fifty years afterwards were to be\r\ndiscovered here.\r\n\r\nWhilst Slavic poetry found so many votaries among the Dalmatians, it\r\nis a remarkable fact, that all their historians wrote in Latin or\r\nItalian. They possess indeed a very old chronicle, of the date of A.D.\r\n1161, written in the Slavic language by an anonymous Presbyter of\r\nDioclea, and translated by himself into Latin; but in the more\r\nflourishing period of the Dalmatian literature, the love of their own\r\nlanguage was overcome by the stronger desire of a more universal\r\nreputation than any works written in Slavic could procure for them.\r\nThe names of N. Ragnini, Francisco Gondola, Razzi, and Caboga, must\r\nhere be mentioned. The dialect of the country, however, found some\r\nadvocates even among the clergy. For some theological works it was\r\npreferred to the Old Slavic; or at least the Latin letters were chosen\r\nfor this language instead of the Glagolitic types. An Old Slavic\r\ntranslation of the Gospels and Epistles by Bernardin de Spalatro was\r\nprinted with Latin letters, Venice 1495. At the same place appeared,\r\nin 1613, Bandulovich's translation of the same holy books in the\r\ncommon language. A Jesuit, Barth. Cassio, A.D. 1640, had translated\r\nboth the Old and New Testaments; but the printing of it was prevented\r\nby the bishops. Anton Cacich wrote a work on moral theology, in the\r\ncommon dialect of the country: and several ecclesiastics of high\r\nstanding published works for religious instruction in the same\r\nlanguage. The period following the catastrophe of Ragusa was fertile\r\nin theological, or rather religious, productions. The works of the\r\narchidiaconus Albertus, as also of Gucetich and others, contain\r\ntreatises for spiritual edification, devotional exercises, etc.\r\nBiankovitch, bishop of Makarska, wrote a treatise of Christian\r\ndoctrine, Venice 1708, in the common Dalmatian dialect. But this\r\ndialect found its most ardent champion in a priest, Stephan Rosa, who\r\nexerted himself greatly to have the old church Slavonic entirely\r\nsuperseded by the Dalmatian-Servian language. He made a complete\r\ntranslation of the whole Bible, and sent it to the pope, requesting\r\nthat it might be printed and introduced under his high authority\r\ninstead of the Cyrillic Bible. At the same time, he proposed that the\r\nmass should be read in the Dalmatian dialect; dwelling especially on\r\nthe circumstance, that the Cyrillic language was an ingredient of the\r\nGreek church, and consequently the use of it in sacred things a\r\nspecies of Greek heresy. The pope appointed a committee to examine the\r\nnew translation; the result of which was, as may easily be supposed,\r\nthe rejection of a measure which savoured so strongly of\r\nProtestantism. From the time of this decision in A.D. 1754, nothing\r\nwas done to provide the catholic inhabitants of Dalmatia, Bosnia and\r\nSlavonia with a version of the Bible, until at last a new translation,\r\nthe first satisfactory one in the language, made by the Franciscan\r\nmonk and professor Katanesich, was accepted and introduced in 1832 The\r\nmerit of having procured it to be printed and published, belongs to\r\nthe late primate of Hungary, cardinal Rudnay.[24]\r\n\r\nThe inconvenience of such an anarchical state of orthography, and\r\nlikewise in part of the grammar itself, must of course have been felt\r\nvery early; but it would seem that in this department also, the\r\nDalmatian writers acted with more zeal and diligence, than success.\r\nThe above-mentioned Barth. Cassio, and after him another Jesuit, J.\r\nMicalia, endeavoured in the first half of the seventeenth century to\r\nsettle the orthography and subject it to fixed rules. Ardelio della\r\nBella, a member of the same order, published in 1728 a dictionary and\r\ngrammar, in which he abandoned the way opened by his predecessors,\r\nwithout however finding a better one. Jos. Voltiggi endeavoured to\r\nestablish a third system of pronunciation and orthography; his\r\ndictionary and grammar appeared in the year 1803. A few years later a\r\nuseful grammar was published by Appendini; also the great dictionary\r\nof J. Stulli, a work of considerable merit, and far excelling all\r\nprevious works of the same kind.[25]\r\n\r\nAll the different systems and rules of orthography, exhibited and laid\r\ndown in these works, had unfortunately no permanent result. The\r\nDalmatians, the Slavonians, the Croats, and the Servians in Hungary,\r\nwhenever they used Latin letters, all continued to write each in their\r\nown way. This continued until about twelve years ago; when new efforts\r\nbegan to be made to unite all the different branches of the\r\nIllyrico-Servians, and if possible also the Servians of the Greek\r\nChurch, in the use of one general system of orthography. We have seen\r\nabove the anarchy in respect to their literary language, which some\r\nyears before the two Servians Davidovitch and Vuk Stephanovitch had\r\nfound prevailing among their Cyrillic brethren; and what pains they\r\ntook to introduce the pure dialect of the people (essentially the\r\nlanguage of the Dalmatians) as the literary language of the whole\r\nrace; as also the efforts made by Vuk to establish a new alphabetical\r\nsystem. It can hardly be doubted that these efforts; the interest they\r\nexcited; and, above all, the claims preferred by some eminent scholars\r\nconnected with them; roused the jealousy and just ambition of the\r\nIllyrico-Servians. They were far from being willing to give up the\r\nname of _Illyrians_ for that of _Servians_; they felt themselves a\r\npart of a great whole, but they wanted to be acknowledged as the\r\n_principal_ part. In order to become strong, they had above all to\r\nunite, A gentleman of uncommon energy and intelligence at Agram, Dr.\r\nLudovic Gaj, the editor of a Croatian periodical, took the matter in\r\nhand. He prepared a new system of orthography for all the\r\nIllyrico-Servian dialects, founded on the Bohemian model, and greatly\r\napproved by the Bohemian scholars. He himself established a printing\r\noffice in order to carry out his plan. At the same time he enlarged\r\nhis paper, which now became \"The Illyrian National Gazette;\" and\r\ncontrived to secure patrons of name and influence. Schaffarik declared\r\nhimself decidedly in his favour. How far he has succeeded, and how far\r\nin general the few Illyrico-Servian literati have been able to keep up\r\ntheir budding literature during the recent tempests of the times, we\r\nare unable to say. We may say truly that we have wished for Dr. Gaj's\r\nsystem of union the very best success; and have expressed above, how\r\ndesirable we deem it in every respect.[26]\r\n\r\n_Literature of the Catholic Slavonians_.\r\n\r\nThe Slavonians of the Greek Church make use of the Cyrillic letters;\r\nand their productions belong therefore to that division of Servian\r\nliterature.[27] We have seen above, that the catholic Slavonians also\r\nneither speak nor write a different dialect; but that only their mode\r\nof writing, the strange combination according to which they express\r\nthe sounds of the same language, separates them from the Dalmatian\r\nServians.[28] To enter into the details of these varieties would be of\r\nlittle interest for our readers.\r\n\r\nThe light of the Reformation penetrated at an early day into Slavonia,\r\nand gave birth to a kind of limited theological or ecclesiastical\r\nnational literature. But the catholic clergy soon succeeded in\r\nextinguishing it; and in the same proportion, the Latin language\r\ncontinued to supersede the dialect of the people. In more modern days,\r\nthe Latin has been preferred by nearly all catholic Slavonic writers;\r\nand their own literature is now almost exclusively limited to works\r\nfor religious instruction, catechisms, prayer-books, etc.\r\n\r\nBut although their language was thus relinquished in a practical point\r\nof view, it remained nevertheless the object of investigation to some\r\nof their profoundest scholars. Thus the Latin works of Prof.\r\nKatancsich, are almost all of them devoted to Slavic philological\r\ninquiries, etc, The translation of the Bible mentioned above, was made\r\nby the same learned individual.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE AND LITERATURE OF THE CROATIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchaffarik in his history of the Slavic Language and Literature\r\nenumerates, on Dobrovsky's authority, the Croatians or Croats as a\r\ndistinct branch of the great Eastern Slavic stem. Later researches\r\nhowever have identified them, to a certain extent, with the other\r\nSouthern Slavi or Illyrico-Servians, with whose language theirs is\r\nessentially the same. The recent political events, and their struggles\r\nagainst the Hungarians, have made the Croats in our days again the\r\nsubject of some interest and curiosity, There is however such a\r\nconfusion in the early history of this race; such a change of names,\r\nboundaries, and constitutions; such a contradiction between the\r\naccounts of ancient writers and the experience of modern times; that\r\nit would require a long historical exposition to give to the reader a\r\nclear view of their relation to each other and to their Slavic\r\nbrethren. For such an exposition there is no room in these pages.[30]\r\n\r\nThe subject becomes far simpler if we consider the Croats only in\r\nrespect to their language, as it prevails among them at the present\r\ntime. Here they do _not_ appear as a distinct race; but still are\r\ndivided into two portions. One, in Military Croatia, comprising the\r\nmilitary districts of Carlstadt and Varasdin, and also the Banal\r\nBorder, speak the Dalmatian-Servian dialect with very trifling\r\nvariations; the other, in Provincial Croatia, i.e. the provincial\r\ncounties of Agram, Kreutz, and Varasdin, approach nearer to the\r\nSlovenzi or Vindes, whose language will be the subject of our next\r\nsection.[31] The dialect of this latter division of the Croatians\r\nforms indeed, in a certain measure, the transition and connecting link\r\nbetween the Dalmatian-Servian and the Vindish languages.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned above,[32] that the Croatians adopted a system of\r\nwriting different from that of the Dalmatians. The earliest documents\r\nof their literature are of the sixteenth century, and all belong to\r\nthe history of the Reformation. Here also the new doctrines found\r\nminds willing to receive them; and as several of the _magnates_, among\r\nwhom is the illustrious name of Zriny, were also their supporters,\r\nthere was no difficulty in establishing a press, in order to diffuse\r\nthe new light with greater speed and certainty. In the course of the\r\nlast half of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncenturies, a large number of Croatian books, catechisms, postillae,\r\netc. were printed. One of the warmest champions of the Reformation was\r\nMichael Buchich, curate of the island Murakoz, who publicly adopted\r\nthe Calvinistic confession, and endeavoured to spread abroad his own,\r\nconvictions by sermons and writings. Persecuted by the bishops,\r\ncondemned by synods, he and his followers found some protection in the\r\nChristian tolerance of the emperor Maximilian II. But the successors\r\nof this prince thought otherwise; and the most powerful of the\r\nHungarian noblemen took arms for the defence of the Romish religion.\r\nAt the diets held in 1607 and 1610, destruction was sworn to the new\r\ndoctrines and to their adherents; and all steps were taken for the\r\nfulfilment of the oath.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the seventeenth century, all Croatia had reverted\r\nto Romanism. From that time onward, for more than fifty years, there\r\nwas not a thought of cultivating the language of the people; all books\r\nwere again written in Latin, and are so mostly even to the present\r\nday. The first who interested himself anew for the foundation of a\r\nnational literature, was Paul Ritter, of Vitezovich, ob. 1713, who\r\nprocured a printing office to be established by the estates, and\r\nhimself wrote several books in the Croatian language. A few writers\r\nfollowed his example; but the activity of the press was, and is now,\r\nalmost exclusively devoted to the printing of the ordinary catholic\r\nbooks for spiritual edification and religious instruction. The Gospels\r\nare extant in the Croatian dialect; but not the whole Bible. Most of\r\nthe Croats, however, are able to read and understand the books of\r\ntheir Dalmatian neighbours.[33]\r\n\r\nThe idea of a union among the Illyrico-Servians in respect to\r\northography and literature, was principally favoured by the\r\nCroatians, and indeed originated among them. Here Dr. Gaj and\r\nCount Janko Draskovich, who endeavoured to interest the Illyrian\r\n_ladies_ in the subject, by a patriotic address, had their residence.\r\nThe events of our own days have taught us, how in general the\r\nfeeling of _Slavic nationality_, in opposition to the Magyar\r\nnationality, was roused among the Croatians; for although all\r\nthe different Slavic tribes scattered throughout Hungary--Slovaks,\r\nRuthenians, and Servians--participated in them, yet that feeling\r\nwas strongest among the South western Slavi; who united, as is\r\ngenerally known, to elect Jellachich as their Bann.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE AND LITERATURE OF THE VINDES OR SLOVENZI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Slavic inhabitants of the Austrian provinces Carinthia, Carniola,\r\nand Stiria, extending from thence in scattered villages into Udine\r\nonce the territory of Venice, and of the Hungarian counties Eisenburg\r\nand Szala, about a million in number, call themselves _Slovenzi_. By\r\nforeign writers they have generally been called _Windes_ or _Vindes_;\r\na name, however, less definite and less correct; inasmuch as the term\r\nVindes or Vendes served in ancient times among the Germans as a\r\ngeneral name for _all_ Slavic nations. The Slavic settlements in\r\nCarniola took place at a very early period, certainly not later than\r\nthe fifth century. In the course of the following centuries their\r\nnumber was increased by new emigrations from the southeast; and they\r\nextended themselves into the lower parts of Stiria and Carinthia, and\r\nthe western counties of Hungary.[34]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the language of this people, it was formerly considered a\r\nmatter of certainty, that it had never been a written language before\r\nthe time of the Reformation. But the investigations of modern\r\nphilologians have proved, on the contrary, that this portion of the\r\nSlavic race was earlier acquainted with the art of writing than were\r\nany of the other branches; probably even before the time of Cyril; and\r\nsince the discovery of several very old manuscripts in the library of\r\nMunich, every doubt of this fact has been silenced. According to\r\nKopitar,[35] the true home of the Old Slavic Church language is to be\r\nfound among the Pannonian and Carinthian Slavi; and it was for them\r\nthat the Old Slavonic Bible was translated. The liturgy of Methodius\r\nwas, however, soon supplanted by the Latin worship; which at any rate\r\nmust have been earlier established in this part of the country; since\r\nChristianity appears to have been introduced about the middle of the\r\neighth century, by German priests.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the definite history of the language begins only\r\nwith the Reformation; and it is principally to the exertions of one\r\ndistinguished individual, that it owes its introduction into the\r\ncircle of literature. There is nothing more pleasing in the moral\r\nworld, than to behold the whole life of a man devoted to one great\r\ncause, his thoughts all bent on one great object, his exertions all\r\naiming at one great purpose; and so much the more, if that object has\r\nrespect to the holiest interests of mankind. Such was the case with\r\nthe _primus_ Truber, who may be called the apostle of the Vindes and\r\nCroatians. The direct results of his labours long ago perished in the\r\nlapse of time; but this does not render them less deserving, although\r\nit diminishes his fame. Truber, born A.D. 1508, canon and curate at\r\nseveral places in Carniola and Carinthia, seems to have been early in\r\nlife impressed with the truth of the new doctrines of the Reformation.\r\nHis sound judgment taught him, that the surest way of enabling his\r\nflock, and the common people in general, to receive the new light in a\r\nproper spirit, would be the diffusion of useful knowledge among them.\r\nAnd as the German, which at the present day is almost exclusively the\r\nlanguage of the cities of Stiria, Carniola, and Carinthia, was at that\r\ntime far less generally understood, he ventured to commit to paper a\r\ndialect apparently never before written. In the second edition of his\r\nNew Testament, A.D. 1582, he states expressly: \"Thirty-four years ago,\r\nthere was not a letter, not a register, still less a book, to be found\r\nin our language; people regarded the Vindish and Hungarian idioms as\r\ntoo coarse and barbarous to be written or read.\"\r\n\r\nTruber and his assistants in this great work of reformation and\r\ninstruction, among whom we mention only Ungnad von Sonnegg and\r\nDalmatin, met every where with opposition and persecution; but their\r\nactivity and zeal conquered all obstacles, and succeeded in at least\r\npartially performing that at which they aimed. Meantime, Christopher,\r\nduke of Würtemburg, a truly evangelical prince, had opened in his\r\ndominions an asylum for all those who had to suffer elsewhere on\r\naccount of their faith. The translation of the Scriptures every where\r\ninto the language of the common people, was regarded by this prince as\r\na holy duty; and this led him to cause even Slavic printing-offices to\r\nbe established in his dominions, Thither Truber went; and after\r\nprinting several books for religious instruction, he published the\r\nGospel of Matthew in a Vindish translation, Tübingen 1555; and two\r\nyears later the whole New Testament. As Truber did not understand the\r\nGreek original, his translation was made from the Latin, German, and\r\nItalian versions. At the same time a translation for the\r\nDalmatic-Croatians was planned; and several works for their\r\ninstruction printed and distributed. Truber, thus an exile from his\r\nown country, died in 1586 as curate in the duchy of Würtemburg,\r\nengaged in a translation of Luther's House-postillæ.\r\n\r\nTwo different systems of orthography had been adopted by Truber and\r\nDalmatin. For this reason, when in 1580 the whole Vindish Bible was to\r\nbe printed at Wittemberg, it seemed necessary to fix the orthography\r\naccording to acknowledged rules. This led also to grammatical\r\ninvestigations. In the year 1584, a Vindish grammar was printed at\r\nWittemberg, the author of which, A. Bohorizh of Laibach, was a pupil\r\nof Melancthon, and a scholar of that true philosophical spirit,\r\nwithout which no one should undertake to write a grammar, even where\r\nhe has only to follow a beaten path; much less when he has to open for\r\nhimself a new one. Thus the Vindish written language, almost in its\r\nbirth, acquired a correctness and consistency, to which other\r\nlanguages hardly attain after centuries of experiments, innovations,\r\nand literary contests. According to the judgment of those who are best\r\nacquainted with it, the Vindish language has undergone no change since\r\nthe time of Bohorizh,--a fact indeed scarcely credible; and the less\r\nso, because during that whole interval it has been maintained almost\r\nexclusively as a spoken language. About thirty years after the\r\npublication of this grammar, the Roman Catholics, sheltered by the\r\ndespotic measures of the archduke Ferdinand, afterwards the emperor\r\nFerdinand II, gained a complete victory. All evangelical preachers,\r\nand all Protestants who faithfully adhered to their religion, were\r\nexiled; their goods confiscated; and, more than all, their books\r\n_burned_, and their printing-office in Laibach destroyed.[36]\r\nFragments of the Gospels and of the Epistles were however printed at\r\nGrätz, in 1612, for the Slavic Catholics, in their own language.\r\n\r\nA whole century passed, and the Vindish language seemed to be entirely\r\nlost for literature and science. Towards the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, an academy was founded by some learned men of Carniola, on\r\nthe plan of the Italian Academy; and some attention was again paid to\r\nthe language of their forefathers. In A.D. 1715 a new edition of\r\nBohorizh's work, with several alterations and without mentioning the\r\ntrue author, was printed by a capuchin, P. Hippolitus; who left also\r\nin manuscript a Vindish dictionary, the first in that language.\r\n\r\nFifty-three years later, another grammar was published by the monk\r\nMarcus Pochlin; a work in itself, according to the best authorities,\r\nutterly devoid of merit, but which from the necessity of the case, and\r\nfor the want of a better, met with success, was reprinted in 1783, and\r\nremained in common use until the appearance of Kopitar's grammar. This\r\nlast work,[37] written by one of the most eminent Slavists of the age,\r\nmade a decided epoch; not only in the history of the Vindish language,\r\nbut also, by its learned preface and comments, in the Slavic\r\nliterature at large. Several grammatical works, not without merit, and\r\nfor the most part founded on Kopitar's grammar, have since been\r\npublished;[38] and since scholars like these are now occupied with the\r\ncultivation of the Vindish language, there exist for it and for its\r\nkindred dialects the happiest prospects.\r\n\r\nThat this Slavic branch, a mountain people, had its treasures of\r\npopular poetry, has always been supposed; and many single pieces, not\r\nwithout beauty, have been communicated to the public in German\r\ntranslations. A _collection_ of these flowers, which fade rapidly away\r\nin this German neighbourhood, was ten years ago made by Achazel and\r\nKorytko.[39]\r\n\r\nThe literature of a people, among whom every individual of any\r\neducation may call another highly cultivated language in the fullest\r\nsense his own,--as is the case with the Bohemians and Slovenzi in\r\nrespect to the German,--cannot be very extensive. There have, however,\r\nin modern times, been published several works of poetry and prose in\r\nthe Vindish language; among the writers of which we can mention only\r\nthe most distinguished. Such are, V. Vodnik, author of some\r\ncollections of poems; Kavnikar, author of a biblical history of the\r\nOld and New Testament, and several works for religious edification;\r\nFarnik, Kumerdcy, Popovich, etc.\r\n\r\nBut the most important work, both in a philological and moral point of\r\nview, is the translation of the whole Bible, set on foot by G. Japel,\r\nand executed by a society of learned men. This version being intended\r\nfor Catholics, was made from the Vulgate, and was published at Laibach\r\n1800, in five volumes; the New Testament appeared also separately, in\r\ntwo volumes, Laib. 1804. A Slavic pulpit, which was established ten\r\nyears ago at the same place, has also been of great service to the\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the provincial counties Agram, Kreutz, Varasdin,\r\nand the neighbouring districts, called Provincial Croatia, who speak a\r\nsomewhat different dialect of the Vindish language, but are able to\r\nread that version of the Bible, have nevertheless several translations\r\nin their own dialect, lying in manuscript, and only waiting for some\r\nMaecenas, or for some favourable conjuncture, in order to make their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe only portion of the Vindish race among whom the Protestant\r\nreligion has been kept alive, are about 15,000 Slovenzi in Hungary.\r\nTheir dialect approaches in a like measure to that of the Slovaks; and\r\nhence serves as the connecting link between the languages of the\r\nEastern and Western Slavic stems. For them the New Testament exists in\r\na translation by Stephen Kuznico; Halle 1771; reprinted at St.\r\nPetersburg, 1818.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This portion of the Slavic race was formerly more\r\ncommonly known under the general appellation of _Illyrians_. With the\r\nexception of the Bulgarians, who never have been comprehended under\r\nit, this name has alternately been applied to the Southern Slavic\r\nnations; sometimes only to the Dalmatians and Slavonians; sometimes to\r\nthem together with the Croatians and Vindes; by others again to the\r\nTurkish Servians and Bosnians, etc. The old Illyrians, i.e. the\r\ninhabitants of the Roman province Illyricum, were not Slavi, but a\r\npeople related to the old Thracians, the forefathers of the present\r\nAlbanians; see Schaffarik _Gesch_. p. 33, n. 2. _Illyricum Magnum_\r\ncomprised in the fourth century nearly all the Roman provinces of\r\neastern Europe. Napoleon affected to renew the names and titles of the\r\nancient Roman empire, and called the territory ceded to him by Austria\r\nin 1809, viz. Carniola and all the country between the Adriatic, the\r\nSave, and the Turkish empire, his Illyrian provinces, and their\r\ninhabitants Illyrians. In the year 1815 a new kingdom of Illyria was\r\nfounded as an Austrian province, comprehending Carniola, Carinthia,\r\nand Trieste with its territory. It was partly on account of this\r\nindefiniteness, that the name of _Illyrians_ had been entirely\r\nrelinquished by modern philologists; until it was quite recently again\r\ntoken up by some Croatian and Dalmatian writers. In its stead the name\r\nof _Servians_, or more properly _Serbians, Serbs,_ has been adopted as\r\na general appellation by the best authorities. See below in § 1, on\r\nthe Literature of the Servians of the Greek Church. The word _Srb,\r\nSerb, Sorab_, has been alternately derived from _Srp_, scythe; from\r\n_Siberi, Sever,_ north; from _Sarmat_; from _Serbulja_, a kind of shoe\r\nor sock; from _servus_, servant, etc. The true derivation has not yet\r\nbeen settled. See Dobrovsky's History of the Bohemian Language, 1818;\r\nand also his _Inst. Ling. Slav_. 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See above, p. 9 sq. and the preceding note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The Servians, however, under the government of their own\r\nenergetic countryman, Prince Milosh, for some years enjoyed a certain\r\ndegree of freedom, which no doubt has had good results for the mental\r\nlife of the nation. A good view of their country, constitution, and\r\nliterature, is given in a modern German work: _Reise nach Serbien im\r\nSpätherbst_ 1829, by Otto von Pirch, Berlin 1830.

Since the printing of Vuk's\r\nsecond edition of the Servian popular songs at Leipsic, several other\r\nServian books have also been printed there. The Vladika of Montenegro\r\nhas also established a printing office at his residence of Tzetinja.\r\nVuk's \"Proverbs\" have been printed there.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The complete title of this valuable work is: _Istorja\r\nraznich Slavenskich narodov nairatchvedshe Chorvatov, Bolgarov, i\r\nSrbov_, Vienna 1792-95, 4 vols.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The writings of this very productive philologist and\r\nhistorian are however more remarkable for boldness and singularity of\r\nassertion, than for depth. In his _Rimljani slavenstvovavshii_, Buda\r\n1818, he undertakes to derive the entire Latin language from the\r\nSlavic. In an earlier work, written 1809, he contends that the German\r\nlanguage was a corruption of the Slavic dialects spoken on the Elbe.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The reader will find a more complete catalogue of the\r\nServian writers and their works, in O.v. Birch's Travels; see above,\r\np. 107, n. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Narodne Serpske Poslovitze_, Zetinya 1836.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See below in §2.b, Dalmatian Literature.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See more on Servian popular poetry in Part IV. The title\r\nof Vuk's collection, a part of which appeared 1814-15 at Vienna, in\r\ntwo small volumes, is _Narodm Srpske pjesme_, Lpzg 1823-24, three\r\nvolumes. A fourth volume was published at Vienna 1833, with a very\r\ninstructive preface. Some of these remarkable songs have been made\r\nknown to the English public in Bowring's Servian Popular Poetry,\r\nLondon 1827. This little collection contains also an able and spirited\r\nintroduction, which serves to give a clear view not only of the state\r\nof the Servians in particular, but also of the relation of the Slavic\r\nnations to each other in general; with the exception of some mistakes\r\nin respect to classification.--In Germany a general interest for\r\nServian national poetry was excited by Goethe; see his _Kunst und\r\nAlterthum_, Vol. V. Nos. I and II. German translations are:\r\n_Volkslieder der Serben_, by Talvj, 2 vols. Halle 1825-26; from which\r\nwork Bowring seems chiefly to have translated. _Die Wila_, by\r\nGerhardt, 2 vols. Lpzg. 1828. These two works contain nearly all the\r\nsongs published by Vuk, in his first three volumes; but only half of\r\nthose he has collected. _Serbische Volkslieder_, by v. Götze, St. Pet.\r\nand Lpzg. 1827. _Serbische Hochzeitlieder_, by Eugen Wesely, 1826. A\r\nFrench translation of these songs does not yet exist, although they\r\nhave excited a deep interest among the literati of France. The work\r\n_la Guzla_, published at Paris in 1827 and purporting to contain\r\ntranslations of Dalmatian national songs, is not genuine; it was\r\nwritten by the French poet Mérimée, with much talent indeed, but\r\nwithout any knowledge of the Servian language.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: That is: Wolf, son of Stephan, belonging to the family\r\nof the Karadshians, inhabitants of a certain district or village. The\r\nServians in Servia proper and Bosnia have not yet any family names.\r\nThose who emigrated in early years to other countries mostly adopted\r\ntheir fathers' names with the suffix of _vitch_ as a family name; for\r\ninstance Markovitch, Gregorovitch, i.q. Markson, Gregorson, etc. The\r\nServian subjects of Turkey, who settle in other parts of the country,\r\nstill mostly follow this rule. Vuk neglected this; and acquired\r\ntherefore his literary fame under his Christian name of _Vuk_. But, as\r\na father of a family and an Austrian citizen, he is called\r\n_Karadshitch_ after his tribe; which for reasons we do not know he\r\nseems to have preferred to the name of Stephanovitch.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: We must correct here a mistake made by Dr. Henderson in\r\nhis Biblical Researches, in respect to the Servian New Testament. He\r\nsays, p. 263, \"A version of the (Servian) New Testament was indeed\r\nexecuted some years ago, but its merits were not of such a description\r\nas to warrant the committee of the Russian Bible Society to carry it\r\nthrough the press; yet, as they were deeply convinced of the\r\nimportance of the object, they were induced to engage a native\r\nServian, of the name of Athanasius Stoïkovitch to make a new\r\ntranslation, the printing of which was completed in the year 1825, but\r\nowing to the cessation of the Society's operations, the distribution\r\nof the copies has hitherto been retarded.\" Dr. Henderson probably\r\nreceived his information at St. Petersburg, and felt himself of course\r\nentitled to depend on it, being very likely not acquainted with the\r\ngreat schism in modern Servian literature above mentioned. If we may\r\nconfide in our own recollections, the translation, the merits of which\r\nthe committee of the Russian Bible Society was so little disposed to\r\nacknowledge, was made by Vuk Stephanovitch, who knew better than any\r\none else the wants of the Servian people, and who presented in the\r\nabove mentioned Gospel of St. Luke a specimen to the learned world,\r\nwhich received the approbation of all those Slavic scholars entitled\r\nto judge of the subject. The committee of St. Petersburg, however, was\r\nprobably composed of gentlemen of the opposite party; as indeed the\r\nRussian Servians are, in general, advocates of the mixed Slavo-Servian\r\nlanguage, in which for about fifty years all books for the Servians\r\nwere written, and which we have described above in Schaffarik's words;\r\nsee p. 108. According to their ideas of the Servian language, the mere\r\nuse of the common dialect of the people was sufficient to inspire\r\ndoubts of the competency of the translator; although it was for the\r\npeople, the unlearned, that the translation was professedly made. They\r\nengaged in consequence Professor Stoïkovitch, the author of several\r\nRussian and Slavo-Servian books (see above p. 112), and who had been\r\nfor more than twenty years in the Russian service, to make a new\r\ntranslation. This person, who, to judge from our personal acquaintance\r\nwith him, probably on this occasion read the Gospels for the first\r\ntime in his life with any attention, took the rejected version for his\r\nbasis; altered it, according to his views of the dignity of the\r\nServian language, into the customary mixed Slavo-Servian Russian\r\nidiom; and received the reward from the Society. Whether this is the\r\nversion afterwards printed at Leipsic and distributed in Servia by the\r\nEnglish Bible Society, we are not informed. From private letters we\r\nknow, that in the year 1827, that Society proposed to Vuk\r\nStephanovitch to allow him £500, if after obtaining appropriate\r\ntestimonies for the correctness of his version, he would print one\r\nthousand copies in Servia; and also authorized its correspondent in\r\nConstantinople, Mr. Leeves, to arrange the matter finally with Vuk.\r\nFrom M. Kopitar's remark however, that the translation for the\r\nDalmatian Roman Catholics needed only to be transcribed with Cyrillic\r\nletters to come into use among the eastern Servians, we are entitled\r\nto conclude that the version now circulated, is not such as it ought\r\nto be; and a correct one, for that part of the nation, is still a\r\ndesideratum. It would seem therefore that Vuk Stephanovitch cannot\r\nhave accepted the offer in question. See Kopitar's Letter to the\r\nEditor of the Bibl. Repos. Vol. III. 1833, p. 186.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: The _Serbianka_ of Milutinovitch was published at\r\nLeipsic, 1826; his History at the same place, 1837.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Pjevanija Tzernogorska i Herzegovatshka etc. izdana\r\nJosifom Milowukom,_ Ofen 1833--_Pjevanija Tzernogorska i\r\nHerzegovatshka sabrana i izdana Tshubrom Tshoikovitckom, etc_.

Of the seven Slavic cases, only\r\nthe nominative and vocative remain to it; all the rest being supplied\r\nby means of prepositions. As Bulgaria has been for centuries the great\r\nthoroughfare of other nations, the Slavic natives have become mixed\r\nwith Rumenians, Turco-Tartars, and perhaps Greeks, It is in this way,\r\nthat the state of their language may be accounted for.\r\n\r\nUp to 1392, when Bulgaria was an independent kingdom,--tributary to\r\nthe Greek empire, until the decline of the latter encouraged them to\r\nbreak the weak tie of vassalage.--their writings were in the Old\r\nSlavic language; and many documents in it are still extant in monastic\r\nlibraries. Venelin, a young Russian scholar, who by his researches on\r\nthe Bulgarian, or, as he would fain call it, the _Bolgarian_ language,\r\nhad excited great hopes in the learned Slavic world, was sent in 1835\r\nto Bulgaria, by the Russian Archaeographical Commission, to search,\r\nafter historical documents and to examine the language. The\r\npublication of a \"Bolgarian Grammar,\" and two volumes of a \"History of\r\nthe Bolgarians,\" were the result. While engaged in preparing a third\r\nvolume, he died; less regretted by the literary world, it is said,\r\nthan would have been anticipated some years before; since his\r\nproductions had not justified the expectations raised by his zeal. He\r\nseems to have been one of those visionary etymologists, who found\r\ntheir conclusions on the analogy of sound and similar accidental\r\nfeatures; a class of scholars, which, in our age of philosophical\r\nresearch, has no longer much chance of success.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Bulgarians is a series of continued warfare with\r\nthe Servians, Greeks, and Hungarians, on the one hand; and on the\r\nother, with the Turks, who subdued them, and put an end to the\r\nexistence of a Bulgarian kingdom in A.D. 1392. The people, first\r\nconverted to Christianity by Cyril and Methodius, had hitherto adhered\r\nto the Greek church; except for a short interval in the last half of\r\nthe twelfth century, when the Roman chair succeeded in bringing them\r\nunder its dominion. Since the establishment of the Turkish government,\r\napostasy to Muhammedanism has been more frequent in Bulgaria, than in\r\nany other of the Christian provinces of the Porte. Still, the bulk of\r\nthe population has remained faithful to the Slavic Greek worship. The\r\nscanty germs of cultivation sown among them by two or three of their\r\nprinces, who caused several Byzantine works to be translated into the\r\nBulgarian dialect, perished during the Turkish invasion. The few\r\nbooks used by the priesthood in our days, are obtained from Russia.\r\nThey have no trace of a literature, and the only point of view from\r\nwhich their language, uncultivated as it is, can excite a general\r\ninterest, is in respect to their popular songs. In these this dialect\r\nlikewise is said to be exceedingly rich.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Bible Society had prepared a Bulgarian translation of the\r\nNew Testament, intended more especially for the benefit of the\r\nBulgarian inhabitants of the Russian province of Bessarabia. But the\r\nspecimen printed in 1823 excited some doubt as to the competency of\r\nthe translator in respect to his knowledge of the Bulgarian language;\r\nand it was deemed advisable to put a stop to its further progress.\r\nAmong the Albanian portion of its inhabitants, the New Testament has\r\nbeen distributed by the British and Foreign Bible Society.\r\n\r\nIn the dearth of all philological helps in respect to the Bulgarian\r\nlanguage, it is matter of grateful acknowledgment to Slavic scholars,\r\nthat an American missionary, the Kev. E. Biggs, stationed at Smyrna,\r\nshould recently have taken up the subject, and furnished us with a\r\nbrief sketch of the principal features of the Bulgarian grammar. It\r\nseems that the Bulgarians have availed themselves of the printing\r\nestablishment founded by the American missionaries at Smyrna; and some\r\nbooks in this language have been there printed. Mr. Kiggs says of the\r\nlanguage, that \"its literature is very slender, consisting almost\r\nentirely of a few elementary books, printed in Bucharest, Belgrad,\r\nBuda, Cracow, Constantinople, and Smyrna.\" A Bulgarian translation of\r\nGallaudet's \"Child's Book on the Soul,\" was sent by the same gentleman\r\nto New York. From the same source we learn that a Bulgarian version of\r\nthe New Testament was printed at Smyrna in 1840, for the British and\r\nForeign Bible Society; and that in 1844 the first number of a monthly\r\nmagazine, entitled \"Philology,\" was issued from the same press.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See above, pp. 27, 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Wiener Jahrbucher der Literatur_, 1822, Vol. XVII.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN SLAVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCZEKHO-SLOVAKIAN BRANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE CZEKHISH OR BOHEMIAN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the Slavic languages, the Bohemian dialect with its literature\r\nis the only one, which, in the mind of the protestant reader, can\r\nescite a more than general interest. Not so much indeed by its own\r\nnature, in which it differs little from the other Slavic languages;\r\nbut from those remarkable circumstances, which, in the night of a\r\ndegenerate Romanism, made the Bohemian tongue, with the exception of\r\nthe voice of Wickliffe, the first organ of truth. Wickliffe's\r\ninfluence, however great and decided it may have been, was\r\nnevertheless limited to the theologians and literati of the age; his\r\nvoice did not find that responding echo among the common people, which\r\nalone is able to give life to abstract doctrines. It was in Bohemia,\r\nthat the spark first blazed up into a lively flame, which a century\r\nlater spread an enlightening fire over all Europe. The names of Huss\r\nand Jerome of Prague can never perish; although less success has made\r\nthem less current than those of Luther and Melancthon. In no language\r\nof the world has the Bible been studied with more zeal and devotion;\r\nno nation has ever been more willing to seal their claims upon the\r\nWord of God with their blood. The long contests of the Bohemians for\r\nliberty of conscience, and their final destruction, present one of the\r\nmost heart-rending tragedies to be found in human history. Not less\r\nready to maintain their convictions with the pen than with the sword,\r\nthe theological literature of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and the first\r\ntwenty years of the seventeenth centuries, is of an extent with which\r\nthat of no other Slavic language can be compared. It is true, however,\r\nthat most of these productions bear decidedly the stamp of the period\r\nin which they were written. Dictated by the polemical spirit of the\r\nage, and for the most part directed by one protestant party against\r\nanother, there is very little to be found in them to gratify the\r\nChristian, or from which the theological student of the present day\r\ncould derive any other than historical instruction. On the other hand,\r\nwhile the theological literature of all the other Slavic nations is\r\nalmost exclusively limited to sermons, catechisms, prayer-books, and\r\nother devotional exercises, among the Bohemians alone do we meet with\r\ncxegetical researches and interpretations, founded on a scientific\r\nexamination of the original text of the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nThere are few branches of science or art in which the Bohemians have\r\nnot to boast of some eminent name. But the talent for which this\r\nnation is the most distinguished is that of music A fondness for music\r\nand a natural gift to execute it is indeed common to all Slavic\r\nnations: but whilst their talent is mostly confined to a susceptible\r\near, and a skill in imitating,--for the Russians and Poles possess\r\nsome celebrated musical _performers_ though very few distinguished\r\n_composers_,--the talent of the Bohemian is of a far higher order.\r\nHe unites the spirit of harmony which characterizes the Germans, with\r\nthe sweet gift of melody belonging to the Italians, and thus seems to\r\nbe the true _ideal_ of a complete musician. A great part of the most\r\neminent names among German composers are Bohemians by birth; and there\r\nis hardly any thing which strikes the American and English traveller\r\nin that beautiful region more, than the general prevalence of a gift\r\nso seldom met with in their own countries.\r\n\r\nBohemia, until the sixth century was inhabited by a Celtic race, the\r\nBoii. After them the country was called _Boiohemnum,_ i.e., home of\r\nthe Boii; in German still Böheim.[1] The Boii were driven to the\r\nsouth-west by the Markomanns; the Markomanns were conquered by the\r\nLombards. After the downfall of the great kingdom of Thuringia in the\r\nmiddle of the sixth century, Slavic nations pushed forward into\r\nGermany, and the _Czekhes_ settled in Bohemia, where an almost\r\ndeserted country offered them little or no resistance. The Czekhes, a\r\nSlavic race, came from Belo-Chrobatia, as the region north of the\r\nCarpathian range was then called.[2] Their name has been usually\r\nexplained from that of their chief, Czekh; but Dobrovsky more\r\nsatisfactorily derives it from _czeti, czjti_, to begin, to be the\r\nfirst; according to him Czekhes signifies much the same as\r\nFront-SIavi.[3] The person of Czekh has rather a mythological than an\r\nhistorical foundation. The whole history of that period, indeed, is\r\nso intimately interwoven with poetical legends and mythological\r\ntraditions, that it seems impossible at the present time to\r\ndistinguish real facts from poetical ornaments. The hero of the\r\nancient chronicles Samo, the just Krok, Libussa the wise and\r\nbeautiful, and the husband of her choice, the peasant Perzmislas, all\r\nmove in a circle of poetical fiction. There is, however, no doubt that\r\nthere is an historical foundation for all these persons; for tradition\r\nonly expands and embellishes; but rarely, if ever, invents.\r\n\r\nWhat we have said in our introduction, in regard to the vestiges of an\r\nearly cultivation of the Slavic nations in general, must be applied to\r\nthe Czekhes particularly.[4] The courts of justice in which the just\r\nKrok and his daughter presided, and which the chronicles describe to\r\nus, present indeed a wonderful mixture of the sacred forms of a well\r\norganized society, and of that patriarchal relation, which induced the\r\ndissenting parties to yield with childlike submission to the arbitrary\r\ndecisions of the prince's wisdom. According to the chronicle, so early\r\nas A.D. 722, Libussa kept a _pisak_ or clerk, literally, _a, writer;_\r\nand her prophecies were written down in Slavic characters. The same\r\nprincess is said to have founded Prague. A considerable number of\r\nBohemian poems, some of which have been only recently discovered, are\r\nevidently derived from the pagan period. Libussa's choice of the\r\ncountry yeoman Perzmislas for her husband, in preference to her noble\r\nsuitors, indicates the early existence of a free and independent\r\npeasantry. All these scattered features are however insufficient to\r\ngive us a distinct picture of this early period; and here, as among\r\nall other Slavic nations, _history_ commences only with the\r\nintroduction of Christianity. The small states originally founded by\r\nthe Czekhes, were first united into one dukedom during the last years\r\nof Perzmislas; while under his son Nezamysl, in the year 752, they\r\nare said to have first distributed the lands in fee, and to have given\r\nto the whole community a constitutional form.\r\n\r\nThe name of Boii, Bohemians, was transferred to the Czekhes by the\r\nneighbouring nations. They continued to call themselves Czekhes, as\r\nthey do even now. The Moravians, a nearly related Slavic race, who\r\nprobably came to these regions at the same time with the Czekhes,\r\ncalled themselves _Morawczik_,[5] from _Morawa,_ morass, a name\r\nfrequently repeated in Slavic countries. Until A.D. 1029, they were as\r\na people entirely separated from the Bohemians. They had formed\r\ndifferent petty states; their chiefs were called _Kniazi_, like those\r\nof their eastern brethren. The ancient Moravia, however, spread far\r\nbeyond the limits of the present country of this name, and extended\r\ndeep into Hungary. Hence this portion of the Slavic race was also\r\ngenerally comprised under the name of the Pannonic Slavi. We have\r\nshown above, in the history of the Old Slavonic language, that\r\nMoravia, then for a short period a powerful kingdom, was the principal\r\ntheatre of Methodius' exertions.[6] As at this time Christianity had\r\nbeen already introduced into these regions, and the kings Rostislav\r\nand Svatopluk, as well as most of their subjects, were already\r\nbaptized, it is very probable that they were induced by motives of\r\npolicy to send to Constantinople for a Christian teacher. Oppressed by\r\nthe Germans, the usurpations of whose emperors were in a certain\r\nmeasure sanctioned by the chair of Rome, they desired to secure for\r\nthemselves in the Byzantine court a powerful ally. After the\r\ndissolution of the Moravian kingdom in A.D. 1029, the present Moravia\r\nfell to Bohemia; was separated from it repeatedly in the course of the\r\nfollowing centuries; and at length, in the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, became together with this kingdom an ingredient\r\npart of the Austrian states.\r\n\r\nThe Moravians were among the earliest Slavic tribes converted to\r\nChristianity. As early as the seventeenth century a considerable\r\nportion of them were baptized by German priests. It was however not\r\nbefore the first half of the ninth century, that the first Christian\r\nmissionaries entered Bohemia. In the year 845, fourteen Bohemian\r\nprinces were baptized at Ratisbon. In the year 894 the duke Borzivog,\r\nthe head of the nation, received baptism; but his successors went back\r\nto idolatry, and with them the greatest part of the people.\r\nChristianity was not firmly established in these regions until the\r\nsecond half of the tenth century. At this time the Slavic liturgy\r\nintroduced by Methodius into Moravia was already, in some measure, by\r\nthe indefatigable exertions of the Romish German priesthood,\r\nsuperseded by the Latin worship. Thus it never was fully established\r\nin Bohemia with the exception of a few churches, attached to convents\r\nfounded expressly in memory of the Slavic saints, Jerome, Cyril, and\r\nMethodius. Their inmates however were expelled in favour of\r\nGerman-Bohemian monks, or they died; and with them disappeared every\r\nvestige of the innovations of Cyril and Methodius. Hence the Old\r\nSlavic language, and the noble translation of the Bible extant in\r\nit, have exercised only an inconsiderable influence on the Bohemian\r\nidiom.[7]\r\n\r\nBohemia, under the sovereignty of her dukes, and from A.D. 1198, under\r\nthat of kings, was independent of the German empire, or at least did\r\nnot belong to its circles; it recognized however a kind of sovereignty\r\nin that powerful neighbour, and the kings of Bohemia deemed it an\r\nhonour to belong to the seven Electors, who chose the worldly head of\r\nChristianity. In the year 1306, the last male descendant of Perzmislas\r\nwas murdered. His house had reigned in Bohemia in uninterrupted\r\nsuccession; although the kingdom was properly not hereditary, but\r\nelective, like Germany, Hungary, and Poland. After a short interval,\r\nthe crown of Bohemia fell by succession to the house of Luxemburg, and\r\nthus became several times united with the Roman imperial crown. Under\r\nthe emperor Charles IV, Bohemia rose to the summit of its lustre. It\r\nwas he who founded, A.D. 1348, the university of Prague, the first\r\nSlavic institution of that description.[8] Under his successor,\r\nWenceslaus, the war of the Hussites began. In the year 1457. the\r\nBohemians maintained their right of election by placing George\r\nPodiebrad, a Bohemian, on the throne. The wisdom and equity of this\r\nindividual justified their choice. In A.D. 1527, Ferdinand I, archduke\r\nof Austria, was elected king; and from that time the Bohemians have\r\nnever again been able to detach themselves from Austria; with the\r\nexception of a short interval, during which the unfortunate palatine\r\nFrederic, known in the history of the thirty years' war, was placed on\r\ntheir throne. During the fifteenth, sixteenth, and the first half of\r\nthe seventeenth, centuries. Bohemia was almost without interruption\r\nthe theatre of bloody wars and contests in behalf of their religious\r\nliberties. Then came the awful stillness of death, which reigned for\r\nmore than a hundred years over this exhausted and agonized country.\r\nFor its revival and its present comparatively flourishing condition,\r\nit is indebted to its own rich natural resources, and to the wiser\r\npolicy and milder dispositions of the more recent Austrian sovereigns.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian language is the common property not only of the Bohemians\r\nand the Moravians, constituting together about three and a half\r\nmillions in number, but also of nearly two millions of Slovaks, those\r\nvenerable remains of the ancient Slavic settlements between the\r\nCarpathian mountains and the rivers Theiss and Danube. This people, so\r\nnearly related to the Czekhes, occupy the whole north-western part of\r\nHungary; and are, besides this, scattered over that whole kingdom.\r\nThey _speak_ indeed a dialect or rather several dialects essentially\r\ndifferent from the language spoken in Bohemia and Moravia; but the\r\ncircumstance of their having, since the Reformation, chosen the\r\nBohemian for their literary language, amalgamates their contributions\r\nto literature with those of the Bohemians, and gives them an equal\r\nright to the productions of these latter.\r\n\r\nOf all the modern Slavic languages, the Bohemian was the first\r\ncultivated. Two bishops of Merscburg, Boso towards the middle of the\r\ntenth century, and Werner at the close of the eleventh, as also fifty\r\nyears later another German priest, Bruno, were above all active in\r\npromoting the holy cause of Christianity by religious instruction. The\r\napplication of Latin characters to Slavic words had long been familiar\r\nto the German priesthood; inasmuch as very early attempts had been\r\nmade to convert the subjugated Slavic tribes, scattered through the\r\nnorth of Germany.\r\n\r\nThey now were applied to the Bohemian, so far as writing was requisite\r\nfor religious instruction. According to the old chronicles, there were\r\neven some regular schools erected in those early times, one at Budecz,\r\nnear Prague, and another somewhat later in Prague itself, where Latin\r\nwas taught. Be this as it may, the Latin and German languages had an\r\nearly influence on the formation of the Bohemian. Many foreign words\r\nwere adopted and amalgamated with the language; still more were formed\r\nfrom native roots, after the model of those two idioms. In later times\r\nthis capacity of the Bohemian has been greatly improved; it being one\r\nof the few languages, which, in philosophy, theology, and\r\njurisprudence, have not borrowed their terminology from the Latins and\r\nGreeks, but formed their own technical expressions for ideas received\r\nonly in part from other nations. The extraordinary refinement of the\r\nBohemian verb we have mentioned in our remarks upon the Slavic\r\nlanguages in general. In respect to free and independent construction,\r\nthe Bohemian approaches the Latin; by its richness in conjunctions it\r\ndiffers essentially from the Russian, and is able to imitate the Greek\r\nin all its lighter shades. Thus it yields neither in copiousness nor\r\nin pliability, neither in clearness nor in precision,[9] to any other\r\nSlavic language; while in respect to lexical and grammatical\r\ncultivation it is superior to all of them. The Bohemian alone, of all\r\nthe Slavic languages, has hitherto succeeded in imitating perfectly\r\nthe classic metres; although the same degree of capacity for them is\r\nacknowledged in the Southern-Slavic dialects.\r\n\r\nAfter so much well deserved praise, we must also mention, that in\r\nrespect to sound, the reproach of harshness and want of euphony has\r\nbeen made with more justice against none of the Slavic tongues. It\r\nis true that all the reasons, by which we have above seen the Slavic\r\nlanguages in general defended,[10] apply with equal weight to the\r\nBohemian in particular. It appears also, that this apparent harshness\r\nis more a production of modern times, than a necessary ingredient of\r\nthe original language; for the ancient Bohemian of legends and popular\r\nsongs sounds by far more melodious; and the dialects spoken by the\r\nSlovaks, which are kindred to the Old Bohemian, are full of vowels,\r\nand are even distinguished from the other Slavic tongues by\r\ndiphthongs. On the other hand, it cannot be denied, that the\r\naccumulation of consonants, in which the Bohemian surpasses by far,\r\nnot the Polish, but the southern and eastern languages, and its\r\npeculiar preference of the vowels _e_ and _i_ over the fuller sounding\r\n_a, o, u_, do not add to the euphony of the language; although it\r\nseems singular to bring forward such a reproach against a people so\r\ndistinguished for their musical talent.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Bohemian literature may be divided into five\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ comprises the whole interval from our first knowledge of\r\nthe Czekhes to the influence of Huss; or from A.D. 550 to A.D. 1400.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ period comprises a full century, from Huss to the general\r\ndiffusion of the art of printing.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ period, the golden age of the Bohemian literature,\r\ncomprises about the same interval, and extends to the battle at the\r\nWhite Mountain, A.D. 1620.\r\n\r\nThe _fourth_ period, extends from the battle at the White Mountain to\r\nthe revival of literature in 1774-1780.\r\n\r\nThe _fifth_ period, covers the interval from 1780 to the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From the first settlement of the Czekhes, A.D_. 550, _to John Huss,\r\nA.D_. 1400.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the language of the Czekhes as it existed when they first settled\r\nin Bohemia, nothing is left, except the names they gave to the rivers,\r\nmountains, and towns, and those of their first chiefs. All these names\r\nentitle us to conclude, that their language was then essentially the\r\nsame as at the present time, though more nearly approaching the Old\r\nSlavic. The first _certain_ written documents of the language are not\r\nolder than the introduction of Christianity. There were indeed\r\ndiscovered, about thirty years ago, some fragments of poetry, which\r\nappear to lie derived from the pagan period.[11] The manuscript has\r\nbeen deposited in the Museum of Prague, and the high beauties and\r\nevident antiquity of these poems have secured them warm advocates and\r\nadmiring commentators. But the circumstance that Dobrovsky doubted\r\ntheir genuineness, induces us to regard this point at least as not\r\nincontestable in respect to the language; in respect to the manners\r\nthey describe, and the institutions they allude to, they bear very\r\nstrong evidence of a later origin.[12] Another highly valuable\r\nfragment is the celebrated manuscript of Koniginhof, discovered in the\r\nyear 1817 by the librarian Hanka, half buried among rubbish and\r\nworthless papers.[13] This collection, the genuineness of which is\r\nsubject to no doubt, contains likewise several poems, the original\r\ncomposition of which belongs evidently to the eighth or ninth century.\r\nBut the manuscript itself is not older than the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and cannot therefore be considered as a sure monument of the\r\nlanguage in an earlier age. All these national songs have an\r\nhistorical foundation; they celebrate battles and victories; and their\r\nevident tendency is to exalt the national feelings. They have not that\r\nplastic and _objective_ character which makes Homer and the Servian\r\npopular epics so remarkable; and from which it appears that the poet,\r\nduring the time of his inspiration, is rather _above_ his subject; but\r\nlike the Russian tale of Igor's Expedition, the epic beauties are\r\nmerged in the lyric effusions of the poet's own feelings, who thus\r\nnever attempts to conceal that his whole soul is engaged in his\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe oldest monuments of the Christian age are the names of the days,\r\nwhich are of pure Slavic origin. Of the Lord's Prayer in Bohemian, on\r\ncomparing the oldest copy he could find among the ancient manuscripts,\r\nDobrovsky presumes that the form must have been about the same in the\r\nninth or tenth century; although the manuscript itself is somewhat\r\nlater. A translation of the _Kyrie eleison_, ascribed to Adalbert\r\nsecond bishop of Prague, dates from the same time. During the eleventh\r\nand twelfth centuries many convents were founded and schools attached\r\nto them; German artists and mechanics and even agriculturists settled\r\nin Bohemia. The influence of German customs and habits showed itself\r\nmore and more, and the nobility began to use in preference the German\r\nlanguage. In the course of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,\r\nthis influence increased considerably, and exhibited itself most\r\nfavourably in the lyric poetry of the time, an echo of the German\r\nMinnesingers; many of the poets belonging like them to the highest\r\nnobility. Of all the Slavic nations, the Bohemian is the only one in\r\nwhich the flower of chivalry has ever unfolded itself; and the cause\r\nof its development here is doubtless to be sought in their occidental\r\nfeudal system, and in their constant intercourse with the Germans. The\r\nnatural tendency of the Polish nobility to heroic deeds and chivalrous\r\nadventures was counterbalanced, partly by the oriental character of\r\ntheir relation to the peasantry, which impressed on them at least as\r\nmuch of the character of the Asiatic satrap, as of the occidental\r\nknight; and partly by the want of a free middle class in Poland, as\r\nalso in Russia. True chivalry indeed does not require simply the\r\ncontrast of a low, helpless, and submissive class; its lustre never\r\nappears brighter than when placed side by side with an independent\r\nyeomanry.\r\n\r\nIn calling the Bohemian lyric poetry of this age the echo of the\r\nGerman, we do not mean to say it was wanting in originality; but wish\r\nrather to convey the idea, that the same spirit inspired at the time\r\nthe Bohemians and the Germans, proceeding however from the latter, who\r\nthemselves received it from the more romantic Provence. Of these\r\nheroic love-songs very few are left. There are, however, several\r\nproductions of this period, in which the German influence is not to be\r\nrecognized at all, but which exhibit purely Slavic national features.\r\nWe will here enumerate the monuments of the Bohemian language from\r\nthe twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which have been preserved,\r\nbefore we pass to the fourteenth, which was more productive and\r\nexhibited in some measure a new character.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable is the above-mentioned manuscript of Königinhof.\r\nIt contains, besides several epic songs partly complete and partly\r\nfragmentary, seven or eight charming lyric pieces. The near\r\nrelationship of the Slavic nations among each other, is exhibited in\r\nno feature more strikingly than in their national popular poetry,\r\nespecially in the little lyric songs, the immediate effusion of their\r\nfeelings, wishes, and cares; whilst epic poetry, which draws her\r\nmaterials from the external world, must hence, in every nation, be in\r\nsome measure modified by their different fortunes and situations. With\r\nthe exception of this manuscript and a few scattered love-songs and\r\ntales, all we have from this early period is of a religious character,\r\nviz. a fragment of a history of Christ's passion in rhymes, another of\r\na legend of the twelve apostles, and a hymn on the merits of the\r\nBohemian patron saint, Wenceslaus. There is also a complete Psalter in\r\nBohemian, with a whole series of hymns, or rather rhymed formularies,\r\ncorresponding to those sung in the catholic church, viz a _Te Deum,_,\r\nan office for the dead, a prayer for the intercession of all saints,\r\netc. A piece in prose, entitled \"The complaint of a lover on the banks\r\nof the Moldau,\" a very rare appearance in those early times, was\r\nformerly considered as genuine, on the authority of Linde and\r\nDobrovsky; but has since been proved to be spurious. The first\r\nhistorians of Bohemia, Cosmas and Vincentius, born towards the middle\r\nof the eleventh century, wrote both of them in Latin. The chronicle of\r\nthe first is still extant.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth century the German influence increased so much,\r\nthat the jealousy and impatience of a great part of the nation was\r\npowerfully excited. The king kept a German body guard; German fashions\r\nin dress and manners prevailed at the court; and even in the year\r\n1341, when the privileges of the city of Prague were first solemnly\r\ncommitted to writing, it was done in the German language. Under the\r\nreign of Charles I, or the emperor Charles IV, for he united the two\r\ncrowns on his head, Bohemia, as we have said, reached the highest\r\npoint of its splendour. He wisely limited the privileges of the\r\nGermans in his own kingdom; and reconciled the minds of the Bohemians\r\nby granting to them similar privileges in the German empire. He\r\nhonoured the Bohemian language so much as to recommend expressly, in\r\nthe golden bull, to the sons of the Electors to learn it. His capital,\r\nPrague, was like the apple of his eye; and he did all he could to add\r\nto its embellishments and magnificence. Here he founded in the year\r\n1348 the first Slavic university, on the plan of those of Paris and\r\nBologna. The influence of this institution, not merely on Bohemia, but\r\non Germany and indeed all Europe, was decided. From the time of its\r\nfoundation until 1410, it was the general resort for students from\r\namong the Poles, Hungarians, Swedes, and Germans. It was doubtless the\r\nwish to give it this very kind of universality, which induced Charles\r\nIV, in the statutes of the institution, to allow to the Bohemians only\r\none suffrage in the senate, and the three others to foreigners. We\r\nshall show in the sequel, with what jealousy this apparent preference\r\nwas received by the natives, and what a violent reaction it caused in\r\nthe Bohemian national feelings.\r\n\r\nExperience every where teaches, that schools and academies never\r\nenkindle the spark of genuine poetry; nay, that the erection of formal\r\nscientific institutions is even not favourable to the free\r\ndevelopement of that high gift. In Bohemia, too, the fourteenth\r\ncentury was indeed very productive in rhymed works; but most of them\r\nwere utterly deficient in real poetry. On the other hand, as the\r\nnatural result of a more strictly logical and clearer mode of\r\nthinking, by reason of a scientific education, the style of the\r\nprose writings became more cultivated, concise, and distinct; and the\r\ndirection of mind more general and universal. We find in this period\r\nseveral historical works, viz. (1) A chronicle in Bohemian rhymes,\r\nextending as far as to 1313, and finished about the year 1318, written\r\nunder king John the father of Charles IV, when the influence of the\r\nGerman had reached its highest point. A glowing hatred against that\r\nnation dictated this work, and made it for more than two hundred years\r\nthe favourite book of the Bohemian people. The name of the author is\r\nnot ascertained, although it has been usually ascribed to the canon\r\nDalimil Mezericky.[14] (2) Another Bohemian chronicle, written by\r\norder of Charles IV in Latin, but translated into Bohemian by Przibik\r\nPulkawa. It was first published by Prochazka in the year 1786; the\r\nLatin original in 1794. (3) Martimiani or the Roman chronicle,\r\ntranslated A.D. 1400 from the German, by Benesh of Horowic. (4)\r\nAnother chronicle of the Roman emperors, translated from the Latin by\r\nLaurentius of Brezow, the writer of several other works, some of which\r\nwere printed in the course of the following centuries.--There were\r\nalso several collections of laws; among others the oldest Bohemian\r\nstatutes, by A. of Duba, a valuable manuscript, preserved in the\r\nimperial library of Vienna; the common and the feudal law, translated\r\nfrom the Latin and kept in the library of Prague; the celebrated\r\n_Sachsenspiegel_ or laws of Magdeburg, etc. The constant intercourse\r\nwith foreigners directed the attention of the Bohemians early to the\r\nutility of acquiring other languages, and made the possession of their\r\nown valuable to foreigners. We find, consequently, not less than seven\r\ndictionaries, or vocabularies as they were called, compiled in the\r\ncourse of this century; one of which, the _Bohemarius_ so called of\r\nA.D. 1309, is even written in hexameters. As all these vocabularies\r\nare incomplete, and better ones, founded partly upon them, have been\r\nsince compiled, they have never, so far as we know, been printed; but\r\nare extant in several copies, and are preserved in the libraries of\r\nPrague, Brünn, and several churches.\r\n\r\nPoetry, during this century, took also in Bohemia the same course as\r\nin Germany, and degenerated into loose works of fiction between prose\r\nand verse, mostly allegorical compositions, and the basis of the\r\nmodern novel. Such are Tristram, in 9000 verses, a translation from\r\nthe German; the life of Alexander and the History of Troy from the\r\nLatin, both of them more novel than history; and a great number of\r\nsimilar works.[15] Some fragments of an heroic epic, entitled \"The\r\nBohemian Alexander,\" have been recently found in the archives of\r\nBudweis by Professor Kaubek, and published in the Journal of the\r\nMuseum. All the other poetical productions of this century may be\r\ndivided into fables, satires, and legends, or other allegorical pieces\r\nof an ecclesiastico-didactic tendency, as may be seen even from\r\ntheir titles; e.g. the Nine Joys of Mary, the Ten Commandments, the\r\nFive Sources of Sin, etc. All are equally deficient in poetical merit.\r\n\r\nWith what thoughts the minds of reflecting men and of the reading\r\nclass were at this time chiefly occupied, and how well they were\r\nprepared to receive, in the beginning of the following century, the\r\ndoctrines of Huss, Jerome, and Jacobellus, those teachers of a purer\r\nsystem of divinity, is manifested in some measure in the theological\r\nliterature of the day. A treatise upon the great distress of the\r\nchurch, written by a clergyman called John Miliez, before 1370;[16]\r\nseveral others on the principal Christian virtues; a book of Christian\r\ninstruction written by Shtitny, a Bohemian nobleman, for his own\r\nchildren; a translation of the Jewish Rabbi Samuel's book on the\r\ncoming of the Messiah; and several similar works,--all these seem to\r\nindicate that the religious system of the day was no longer able to\r\nsatisfy reflecting minds. We find also that a great part of the Bible\r\nwas already extant in the Bohemian language in the second half of the\r\nfourteenth century;[17] although not yet collected together. Several\r\ntranslations of the Psalter from this period; also of the prophets\r\nIsaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel; and the Sunday lessons from the Gospels;\r\nare preserved in manuscript in the libraries of Prague, Vienna, and\r\nOels in Silesia. Many others have doubtless perished in the lapse of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From John Huss, A.D. 1400, to the general diffusion of the art of\r\nprinting, about A.D. 1500._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the fifteenth century, the university of Prague\r\nwas in the zenith of its splendour. Several celebrated German scholars\r\noccupied the professors' chairs, and the average number of students\r\nwas twenty thousand. No department of science was neglected; each\r\nfaculty had its distinguished teachers; but it was theology which\r\nexcited decidedly the warmest national interest among the Bohemians\r\nthemselves; it was theology in which the Bohemians maintained the\r\nfirst rank as teachers. The interest in spiritual things was no longer\r\nconfined, as in former times, to those who intended to devote\r\nthemselves to the clerical profession; it pervaded all classes, high\r\nand low. Immediately after Wickliffe's death, an intercourse had been\r\nopened between England and Bohemia by the marriage of a Bohemian\r\nprincess, Ann, sister of king Wenceslaus, to Richard II of England. A\r\nyoung Bohemian nobleman, who had finished his studies in Prague,\r\nrepaired to Oxford, imbibed the sentiments and opinions of Wickliffe,\r\nand on his return put a copy of all Wickliffe's writings into the\r\nhands of John Huss, at that time one of the professors of theology at\r\nPrague; whose mind was probably already prepared for them, and who\r\nbegan to study them with great zeal and devotion. Indeed, the\r\npretensions of the chair of Rome, and the corruption of the clergy,\r\nhad been for some time since looked upon in Bohemia with private\r\ndisgust and open disapprobation; and when the professors Huss, Jerome,\r\nand Jacobellus, began to declaim against monks, auricular confession,\r\nand the infallibility of the pope, they found a responding echo in the\r\nbreasts of their hearers; and all that was novel in their doctrines,\r\nwas the boldness with which they were pronounced, and the logical\r\nconsistency with which they were justified.\r\n\r\nAnother difference of opinion, which tended greatly to augment the\r\nexcitement then reigning at the university, was the contest between\r\nthe two philosophical schools, viz. that of the Realists, who were\r\ndefended by Huss, and the Nominalists, to which nearly all the Germans\r\nadhered. This contest became very soon a national affair; or, more\r\nprobably, had its principal origin in the unjust privileges of the\r\nGermans and the jealousy of the Bohemians. The preference given to the\r\nformer at the foundation of the university, viz. the possession of\r\nthree out of the four suffrages in all matters determined by vote,\r\nbecame anew the subject of debate, and was more especially assailed by\r\nHuss, then rector of the university. After a whole year of resistance,\r\nthe king at length yielded. A decree of A.D. 1409 ordained that in\r\nfuture the proportion should be reversed, so that the Germans should\r\npossess only one suffrage, and the Bohemians three. For this victory\r\nof their national pride, the university, the city, nay the whole\r\ncountry, had to suffer severely. Immediately after this decision, the\r\nfamous literary emigration took place. All the German professors and\r\nstudents left Prague at once. The immediate consequences of this step\r\nwere, the foundation of the universities of Leipzig, Rostock, and\r\nIngolstadt; and the building up of those of Heidelberg, Erfurt, and\r\nCracow. Prague never again became what it had been; although it\r\nobtained a transient lustre through the victory itself, and the\r\neminence and martyrdom of some of its national teachers. Before we\r\nproceed, we must devote a few words to the personal merits and\r\nfortunes of these latter.\r\n\r\nJohn Huss was born A.D. 1373, at Hussinecz, a village in the southern\r\npart of Bohemia; from which he sometimes took the name of Huss of\r\nHussinecz, or John of Hussinecz. Although without property himself, he\r\nwas enabled, at the age of sixteen years, by the pecuniary assistance\r\nof the proprietor of his native village and some other patrons, to\r\nprosecute his studies at the university of Prague, where he\r\ndistinguished himself by his abilities and diligence. In the year 1396\r\nhe was made Master of Arts, and two years later began to lecture on\r\nphilosophical and theological subjects. In A.D. 1402 he was appointed\r\ncurate and preacher to the chapel of Bethlehem at Prague, the duties\r\nof which office he united with his professorship. In the same year the\r\nqueen Sophia chose him for her confessor. He thus at once acquired an\r\ninfluence over the people, the students, and at court. It was about\r\nthis time that he became acquainted with the writings of Wickliffe. In\r\nthe year 1407 he began publicly to oppose and preach against the\r\nerrors in doctrine and the corruption then reigning in the church. The\r\narchbishop of Prague, Zbyniek, an illiterate and violent man, whose\r\nignorance had made him the laughing-stock of the students, by whom he\r\nwas called the _Alphabetarius_, or ABC doctor, collected two hundred\r\nmanuscripts of Wickliffc's writings; and, without any further\r\nauthority from the pope than his previous condemnation of them,\r\ncommitted them to the flames in the archiepiscopal palace. Huss, both\r\nin his lectures and sermons, not only blamed this act in strong terms;\r\nbut translated the _Trilogus_ and several other of Wickliffc's works\r\ninto Bohemian, distributed them among laymen and females, and caused\r\nnew Latin copies to be made. When the archbishop interdicted his\r\npreaching in the Bohemian language, Huss not only refused to obey, but\r\ncontinued to spread, by all legal means, those doctrines of Wickliffe\r\nwhich he approved. At the same time the first translation of the whole\r\nBible--whether a collection of the parts already extant, or a new\r\nversion, we are not informed--appeared, and was distributed in\r\nmultiplied copies among the public. It is not known whether this\r\ntranslation was prepared by Huss; but it is certain that he did what\r\nhe could to promote its circulation. On such proceedings the Romish\r\nclergy could not look with tranquillity. Twice he was called to Rome;\r\ntwice he disobeyed; and at length appealed to a general council. In\r\nconsequence of his doctrines, and of some tumultuous scenes among his\r\nfollowers, the excess of which he himself highly disapproved, he was\r\nby a decree of pope John XXIII solemnly expelled from the communion of\r\nthe church. Deeming himself no longer safe at Prague under the weak\r\nking, he retired to the territory of his friend and patron, Nicholas\r\nof Hussinecz, where he prepared new works, some of which are among his\r\nmost powerful ones, and preached repeatedly in the open fields before\r\nan innumerable audience. Those of his works which caused the greatest\r\nsensation, were his treatise 'On the Church,' and a pamphlet entitled\r\n'The Six Errors;' both of which he caused to be fixed on the walls and\r\ngates of the chapel of Bethlehem. Both were directed against\r\nindulgences, against the abuse of excommunication, simony,\r\ntransubstantiation, and the like; and, above all, against the\r\nunlimited obedience required by the see of Rome; maintaining that the\r\nScriptures presented the only rule of faith and conduct for the\r\nChristian.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this conviction, the correction and distribution of\r\nthe Bohemian Bible was his constant care. In all his Bohemian writings\r\nhe paid an uncommon attention to the language, and exerted a decided\r\nand lasting influence on it. The old Bohemian alphabet, which\r\nconsisted of forty-two letters, he arranged anew; and first settled\r\nthe Bohemian orthography according to fixed principles.[18] In order\r\nto render it more interesting and impressive to learners, he\r\nimitated Cyril's ingenious mode of giving to each letter the name of\r\nsome well-known Bohemian word, which had the same initial letter, e.g.\r\nH, _hospodin_, lord; K, _kral_, king, etc. Thus he devoted his whole\r\nlife to the different means of enlightening his countrymen; and justly\r\nconsidered a general cultivation of the mind as the best preparation\r\nfor receiving the truth.\r\n\r\nAmong the coadjutors of Huss, the most distinguished was Hieronymus\r\nvon Faulfisch, more generally known under the name of Jerome of\r\nPrague; who was, like Huss, professor in the university. In erudition\r\nand eloquence he surpassed his friend; he accorded with him in his\r\ndoctrinal views; but did not possess the mild disposition, the\r\nmoderation of conduct, for which Huss was distinguished. His hatred\r\nagainst the abuses of the Romish church was so violent, that he used\r\nto trample under his feet the relics regarded as holy by that church.\r\nHe is even said to have once ordered a monk who resisted him, to be\r\nthrown into the river. He was so great an admirer of Wickliffe,\r\nseveral of whose writings he translated into Bohemian, that even when\r\npreaching before the emperor at Buda, he could not but interweave that\r\nreformer's doctrines in his sermons; an imprudence which caused him to\r\nbe arrested immediately afterwards at Vienna. He obtained his liberty\r\nin consequence of the solicitation of the university of Prague. He\r\nwrote several works in the Bohemian language, for the instruction of\r\nthe people, hymns, pamphlets, etc. His reputation for erudition and\r\nextraordinary powers rests, however, more on the testimony of his\r\ncotemporaries, than on his works, of which very few remain.\r\n\r\nAnother active assistant of Huss, especially in his improvement and\r\ndistribution of the Bohemian Bible, was Jacobellus of Mies, known\r\nunder the name Jacobellus of the [sacramental] Cup, on account of his\r\nzeal for the general introduction of the communion in both forms. He\r\nwrote commentaries on some of the epistles, sermons, religious hymns,\r\netc. He too was a professor in the university of Prague.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1414 Huss was summoned to appear before the Council of\r\nConstance, to exculpate himself before the united theologians of all\r\nthe Christian nations of Europe. Without the least reluctance, and\r\nrather with rejoicing at the opportunity of justifying himself from\r\nthe extravagant charges brought against him by his enemies, and of\r\ndemonstrating publicly the truth of his doctrines, he obeyed this\r\ncall. Provided with a safe conduct from the emperor Sigismund, and\r\naccompanied moreover by several Bohemian noblemen at the express order\r\nof king Wenceslaus, he undertook the journey without fear for his\r\npersonal safety, and arrived on the fourth of November at Constance.\r\nHere, before he was permitted to appear in the presence of the general\r\nCouncil, he had to undergo several private audiences before a few\r\ncardinals; at one of which, about three weeks after his arrival, he\r\nwas arrested, cast into prison, and without being tried or even heard,\r\nkept more than _six months_. When the news of this treachery reached\r\nBohemia, it was felt by the whole people as a national insult. Three\r\npetitions, signed by nearly the whole body of the nobility, were in\r\nthe course of time successively tendered to the Council; and as the\r\ntwo first were without avail, the third was accompanied by one to the\r\nemperor, in which he was reminded of his broken word, in terms so\r\nstrong,--he having pledged his imperial honour for the safety of\r\nHuss,--that at length the 5th of June was fixed for a public\r\nhearing. Here however every attempt of Huss, not merely to justify\r\nhimself, but even to speak, was frustrated by the most indecent and\r\ntumultuous clamour of the assembled clergy, who loaded him with\r\ninvectives and reproaches. In the two following audiences he was\r\nindeed allowed a hearing, at the special demand of the emperor, who\r\nhad been disgusted and offended by the indecent behaviour of the\r\nCouncil. Huss was now permitted to justify himself at large upon all\r\nthe forty articles brought against him, most of them founded on his\r\nwritings by the frequent aid of the most unfair deduction; but\r\nalthough he exculpated himself completely from some of the charges,\r\nyet he himself acknowledged so many others, that the Council could\r\nonly be confirmed in its previous determination to condemn him as an\r\nobstinate heretic. A month was allowed him, to give in his final\r\nanswer. During this time cardinals and bishops tried their eloquence\r\nto persuade him to recant; especially at the instigation of the\r\nemperor, who wished to save his life on account of his own pledged\r\nhonour. But all these efforts could not move the faith nor firmness of\r\nthis pious and heroic man; and on the 6th of July, A.D. 1415, he was\r\nunanimously condemned, ignominiously degraded from the office of a\r\npriest, and burned alive the same day. His ashes were thrown into the\r\nRhine.[19]\r\n\r\nHis friend Jerome of Prague, on hearing of his dangerous situation,\r\nhurried to Constance, to assist and support him, without even waiting\r\nfor a safe conduct from the emperor or Council. In the vicinity of\r\nConstance he stopped, and tried all possible means to obtain some\r\nassurance for his personal safety. Not succeeding in this, he felt\r\nhimself compelled by prudence to return, although slowly and\r\nreluctantly, to Bohemia. But on the road, in consequence of a dispute\r\nin which he became engaged with some bigoted priests, he was arrested\r\nby the duke of Salzbach and sent to Constance, where the same scenes\r\nwere repeated before the Council, as in the case of Huss. At his first\r\nappearance, a thousand voices exclaimed: Away with him! burn him, burn\r\nhim! It is most melancholy to read in the reports of the time, that\r\neven this strong and pious man could have been terrified into\r\ntemporary submission; not by the prospect of death, which he met\r\ngladly, but by the horrors of a lonely and protracted imprisonment in\r\na noxious dungeon. But his fortitude did not long abandon him;\r\ntortured by his own conscience, he solemnly announced at the next\r\naudience his recantation; and declared, that of all the sins he had\r\ncommitted, he repented of none more than his apostasy from the\r\ndoctrines he had maintained. In consequence of this he was subjected\r\nto the same condemnation as his illustrious friend; and met his\r\npainful death with the same magnanimity and resignation. He was burnt\r\nthe 30th of May, 1416.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of both these eminent men; the Christian mildness with\r\nwhich they bore the infamous treatment of their enemies; the\r\ngenerosity with which they forgave their persecutors; the patience,\r\nnay cheerfulness of Huss, when during his imprisonment severe bodily\r\nsufferings united with the persecutions of his adversaries to make his\r\nlife a heavy burden; the magnanimity and fortitude with which both of\r\nthem submitted to their final fate, and maintained the truth of their\r\nreligious opinions until the very moment of an excruciating death,\r\npraising the Lord with soul and voice; all this presents one of the\r\nmost affecting and at the same time elevating pictures which the\r\nhistory of martyrs has to exhibit. The eloquence of Jerome made a\r\npowerful impression on his enemies; and there were some moments during\r\nhis trial, when even his judges wished to save his life. The\r\ncelebrated Poggio Bracciolini, one of the revivers of Italian\r\nliterature, happened to be present at the trial and execution of\r\nJerome; and although not agreeing with him, or rather being\r\nindifferent in point of religion, the eloquence, magnanimity and\r\namiable deportment of the unfortunate martyr, excited his sympathy and\r\nadmiration in an uncommon degree. This is manifested in his letters to\r\nLeonardo Aretius; who in his reply found it advisable to warn his\r\nfriend, not to show too much warmth in this matter.[20]\r\n\r\nThe instigators of these cruel acts, when they kindled the faggots by\r\nwhich these two martyrs died, did not anticipate that the fire they\r\nhad lighted would spread over a whole country, and carry horror and\r\ndevastation through the half of Germany. The war by which the\r\ndisciples of Huss avenged him, was one of the most bloody and\r\ndestructive known in history. The news of his death, when it reached\r\nBohemia, touched the heart of every individual like an electric spark.\r\nBut this is not our province. Keeping only our own object, the fate of\r\nthe language and literature in view, we must refer the reader to the\r\nhistorical accounts of this distressing period, and limit ourselves to\r\nthe mention of those events only, which had an immediate influence on\r\nthese two topics.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of Nicholas of Hussineccz, the friend and patron of\r\nHuss, in whom even his enemies acknowledged more a defender of the\r\nReformers, than a persecutor of the Catholics; of Zhizhka of Trocznow,\r\na Bohemian knight of great valour, but disgraced by cruelty; and,\r\nafter the death of these two, under Procopius, formerly a clergyman;\r\nthe Hussites carried their victorious arms throughout all Bohemia,\r\ninto Silesia, Franconia, Austria, and Saxony; and made these unhappy\r\ncountries the theatre of the most cruel devastations. If, divided into\r\nseveral parties, as they were, they were thus powerful, they would\r\nhave been twice as strong, had they been united in the true spirit of\r\nHuss. But even as early as A.D. 1421 dissensions arose among them; and\r\nthey finally split into several sects and parties, who mutually hated\r\neach other even more than they did the Romanists. Among these the\r\nCalixtins or Utraquists, whose principal object was to obtain the\r\nsacrament in both forms; and the Taborites, who insisted on a complete\r\nreform of the church; were the two principal. The Calixtins\r\ncomprehended the more moderate of the nobility and the wealthy\r\ncitizens of Prague; between them and the Romanists a compact was\r\nconcluded at Basle, in A.D. 1434, by which a conditional religious\r\nliberty was granted to them, and they acknowledged the emperor\r\nSigismund as their sovereign; the weak king Wenceslaus having died in\r\n1419. The Taborites were unable to resist any longer the united power\r\nof both parties. They partly dispersed; the rest united in the year\r\n1457, in separate communities, and called themselves United Brethren.\r\nUnder the severest trials of oppression and persecution, the number of\r\nthese congregations, the form of which was modelled after the\r\nprimitive apostolic churches, rose in less than fifty years to two\r\nhundred. In the middle of the sixteenth century, numerous emigrations\r\nto Prussia and Poland took place, where a free toleration was secured\r\nto them. In the beginning of the seventeenth century, their\r\ncommunities in Bohemia were finally dissolved. From the remnant of\r\nthese persecuted Christians, who were called by the Germans, Bohemian\r\nor Moravian Brethren, has sprung the present community of United\r\nBrethren, often called in English, Moravians, which was founded at\r\nHernhut in 1722, at first under the protection and ultimately under\r\nthe patronage and direction of count Zinzendorf.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of the barbarous measures of the Council of Constance\r\nbecame immediately visible. Even the common people began to show an\r\nintense interest in the numberless theological pamphlets, which were\r\npublished in Bohemia and Moravia for or against Huss. Among the\r\nformer, one written by a female deserves to be distinguished. The\r\ncopies of the Bohemian Bible became greatly multiplied; many of them\r\nwere made by females: and Æneas Sylvius takes occasion to praise the\r\nbiblical erudition of the women of the Taborites, whilst the abbot\r\nStephen of Dolan in Moravia complains of their meddling in\r\necclesiastical affairs. In the revision of the text of the Bohemian\r\nScriptures, the clergy were indefatigable. From 1410 to 1488, when the\r\nBible was first printed, at least four recensions of the whole Bible\r\ncan be distinguished, and several more of the New Testament. The\r\ndifferent parties of the Hussites were united in a warm partiality for\r\ntheir own language; the Taborites began as early as 1423 to hold their\r\nservice in Bohemian. After the compact of 1434, the Calixtins also\r\nattempted to introduce the mass in their own language, an innovation\r\nwhich caused new disturbances and contests. Meanwhile the language of\r\nthe country assumed gradually even among the Romanists its natural\r\nrights; the privileges of the city of Prague, the laws of the\r\npainters' guild, the statutes of the miners, were translated into\r\nBohemian. At the session of the Estates in Moravia in 1480, the Latin\r\nwas exchanged for the Bohemian; in Bohemia itself not before 1495. The\r\nknowledge of the Bohemian language, which Albert duke of Bavaria had\r\nacquired at the court of king Wenceslaus, where he was educated, had\r\na decided influence on the Bohemian Estates, when in 1441 they offered\r\nhim their crown. Under George Podiebrad, diebrad, a Bohemian by birth,\r\nthis language even became that of the court. After the death of\r\nGeorge, one of the reasons which led to the election of Vladislaus,\r\nking of Poland, was, that the Bohemians \"could hope to see elevated\r\nthrough him the glory of the Bohemian nation and of the Slavic\r\nlanguage.\" [21] Under this king all ordinances and decrees were issued\r\nin the Bohemian language, which gained prodigiously in pliancy and\r\nextent by the application of it to different uses. The most favourable\r\ninfluence on its formation, however, was effected towards the close of\r\nthe fifteenth century, by the custom which began to prevail of\r\nstudying the classics, and of translating them with all the fidelity\r\nof which the idiom was capable. Thus fostered by judicious application\r\nand patriotic feeling, the Bohemian language approached, with rapid\r\nsteps, the period of its _golden age_,--a time, indeed, in a political\r\nrespect, of oppression, war, and devastation; but affording a\r\ngratifying proof, how powerfully moral means may counteract physical\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the theological literature of this period may be named\r\nthe Life of Huss, written by P. Mladienowicz. Although, strictly\r\nspeaking, not a theological book, yet this character was in some\r\nmeasure impressed upon it by the custom which prevailed for a time, of\r\ncausing it to be read aloud in the churches, in order to communicate\r\nto the people all the circumstances of the martyr's death.\r\nMladienowicz, acting as a notary at Constance, had been an eye-witness\r\nof the whole transaction. Among the Romish theological writers of the\r\nday, Hilarius Litomierzicky, ob. 1467, Rosenberg bishop of Breslau,\r\nSimon of Tishnow, and others, wrote against the practice of communion\r\nin both forms. But they were inferior to their adversaries in talent,\r\nand still more in productiveness. Rokycana, archbishop of the\r\nCalixtins, ob. 1471, Koranda, Mirosh, and others, defended their right\r\nto the sacramental cup; and exerted their pens in doctrinal\r\ncontroversies with the other sects. The Bohemian Brethren, Paleczek,\r\nProcopius, Simon, Mirzinsky, and others, wrote interpretations of\r\nportions of the Scriptures, polemical pamphlets, religious hymns,\r\napologies, and the like, partly printed, and partly preserved in\r\nmanuscript. In the contests of the different parties, the use of\r\nweapons of every description was regarded as lawful; and among them,\r\nsatire and irony were employed with much skill and dexterity by the\r\nHussites.[22] Uricz of Kalcnicz wrote a satirical letter from Lucifer\r\nto Lew of Rozhmital. Bohuslav of Czechticz partly wrote and partly\r\ncompiled the work, \"Mirror of all Christendom,\" with many remarkable\r\nillustrations.[23] The Bohemian brother, Chelcicky, ob. 1484, called\r\nalso the Bohemian doctor, because he did not understand Latin, and of\r\ncourse neither Greek nor Hebrew, undertook, nevertheless, besides\r\nseveral other works, to write an interpretation of the Sunday Lessons\r\nof the Gospels. His most popular book, called _Kopyta_, i.e. \"The\r\nShoe-last,\" (being himself a shoemaker by trade,) which was much read\r\nby the common people, is no longer extant. A pamphlet of Martin\r\nLupacz, ob. 1468, called \"The Sprinkling-brush,\" was likewise in the\r\nhands of every body. This clergyman, however, acquired better claims\r\non the gratitude of his cotemporaries, by a careful revision of the\r\nNew Testament, which he undertook with the aid of several learned\r\nfriends. Indeed, both among clergymen and laymen, there was an ardent\r\ndesire for the right understanding of the Scriptures; which induced\r\nmany individuals, who were not satisfied with the existing Bohemian\r\ntranslations, to undertake the task themselves anew.\r\n\r\nOut of this period alone the manuscripts of thirty-three copies of the\r\nwhole Bible, and twenty-two of the New Testament, are still extant;\r\npartly copied from each other, partly translated anew; all, however,\r\nhaving been made from the Vulgate.[24] The Bohemian versions made from\r\nthe original languages belong to the following period.\r\n\r\nAlthough religion filled the minds of the learned during this period\r\nmore than in any other, it did not absorb their interest so entirely\r\nas to occupy them exclusively. It could not, however, be expected,\r\nthat in the midst of such struggles, both political and religious, the\r\nminds of men could elevate themselves so far above their\r\ncircumstances, as to look at any science or art in the light of its\r\nindependent value. Poetry, at least, with a few exceptions, was only\r\nregarded as the handmaid of religion. We find many books of legends,\r\nbiographies of the fathers and saints, both prose and rhyme, written\r\npartly by Romish, partly by Hussite writers. The doctrines of Huss did\r\nnot, like those of Luther a century later, shake the belief in saints.\r\nDobrovsky mentions a very ancient printed work of 1480, in which the\r\nletters of Huss, his life by Mladionowicz, and the letter of Poggio on\r\nthe execution of Jerome, are annexed to a _Passional_, as such\r\ncollections of the lives and sufferings of the saints are called.\r\nThere is also an abundance of Taboritic war-songs; many of them\r\nreplete with life and fire. These appear to have been partly founded\r\non ancient Bohemian popular songs; for there are passages in them\r\nwhich are also to be found in the old chronicles. Altered to suit the\r\nexisting circumstances, their effect must have been the more powerful\r\nby association. This period was also rich in religious hymns; most of\r\nthem translated from the Bible as literally as the rhyme would permit.\r\nBut no form of poetry was more used, and none operated more strongly\r\non the minds of the people, than the satirical ballads, with which the\r\nstreets and alleys every where resounded. All these productions are\r\nonly remarkable, as characteristic memorials of the age. Hynck of\r\nPodiebrad, fourth son of king George, who was born A.D. 1452, a highly\r\naccomplished and amiable man, is named as one of the most\r\ndistinguished among the Bohemian poets of the age.\r\n\r\nPolitics, too, united with religion. Stibor of Cimburg, a patriotic\r\nand distinguished nobleman, wrote in 1467 an ingenious work in the\r\nform of a novel, \"On the goods of the Clergy;\" Waleczowsky wrote on\r\nthe vices and hypocrisy of the clergy; and Zidek, in 1471,\r\ninstructions on government. All these books were dedicated to king\r\nGeorge, and the latter work was even written at his instigation. Hagck\r\nof Hodielin, and Wlezek, between 1413 and 1457, wrote strategetical\r\nworks. Marco Polo's description of the East, and Mandeville's Travels,\r\nwere translated from the Latin. Kabatnik, J. Lobkowicz, and Bakalarz,\r\nwrote descriptions of Palestine between 1490 and 1500; the two first\r\nin books of travels. Mezyhor wrote a journal of the travels of Lew of\r\nRozhmital, whom he accompanied as jester through Europe and a part of\r\nAsia. Collections of statutes, of the decrees of diets, of judicial\r\ndecisions, and of other documents, were made by patriotic and\r\nsometimes eminent men; and those merely extant in Latin were carefully\r\ntranslated into Bohemian.[25] Thus they gathered materials for future\r\nhistorians, although in their own day the field of history was but\r\npoorly cultivated, or at least with no more than common ability; for,\r\nas to quantity, there is no want. Procopius, following out the example\r\nof Dalimil, wrote a new rhymed chronicle; Bartosh of Drahenicz wrote a\r\nchronicle extending from 1419 to 1443, in barbarous Latin, to which he\r\nadded some notes in Bohemian. Several other chronicles, the authors of\r\nwhich are not known, serve as continuations of those of the preceding\r\ncentury, which were devoted to the affairs of their own country. The\r\nabove-mentioned Zidck, on the other hand, undertook to write a\r\nuniversal history, after the division of time then customary, into six\r\nages. This book forms the third part of his great work, \"Instructions\r\non Government,\" to which we have above alluded. In this work the\r\nauthor seizes every opportunity to lecture the king, to give him\r\nadvice, and to rebuke him. According to Dobrovsky, his boldness not\r\nunfrequently degenerates into coarseness and insolence. It is an\r\namusing reproach, which among others he brings against the king, that\r\nhe had net one camel, whilst Job had six thousand. The same individual\r\nwrote also a large work in Latin, a kind of Cyclopædia, the manuscript\r\nof which is in the library of the university of Cracow.\r\n\r\nWe finish the history of this period with a short account of the state\r\nof medicine and natural sciences in Bohemia. It is true, that the\r\ngreater part of the learned men who wrote on these subjects, preferred\r\nthe use of the Latin language. But many of them were in the habit of\r\nmaking at least Bohemian extracts or abridgments of their most popular\r\nworks, or sometimes had the whole of them translated by their pupils.\r\nAmong the medical writers of this time, Christian Prachatitzky a\r\nclergyman, John Czerny and Claudian Bohemian brethren, Albik, and\r\nGallus, must be mentioned; the two latter wrote only in Latin.\r\n\r\nThis section of the Bohemian literature is particularly rich in\r\nherbals. Several works of instruction in botany were also written. A\r\nmanuscript of 1447, \"On the inoculation of Trees,\" may be mentioned\r\nhere, although belonging rather to the department of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian language, although improving and evidently rising in\r\nesteem with every lustrum of the fifteenth century, had however not\r\nyet supplanted the Latin. Many of the most eminent among the learned\r\nof this period preferred still to write in Latin: as Hieronymus\r\nBalbus, Bohuslav, Hassenstein of Lobkowic, Shlechta, Olomucius, and a\r\nnumber of others; who all contributed nevertheless to elevate the\r\nglory of the Bohemian name, and could not but exert a powerful\r\ninfluence on the nation.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the date of the introduction of printing into Bohemia,\r\nthe first regular printing establishment at Prague is not older than\r\nA.D. 1487. Several Bohemian books, however, were printed before this\r\ntime by travelling workmen. In regard to the first work printed in the\r\nBohemian language historians are not entirely agreed. According to\r\nJungmann,[26] a letter from Huss to Jakaubek, of 1459. was the first\r\nspecimen of Bohemian printing; the above-mentioned chronicle of Troy\r\nof 1468 the second; and the New Testament of 1475 the third. According\r\nto Dobrovsky, the New Testament of 1475 is the earliest printed work\r\nin Bohemian. From that year to 1488, only seven Bohemian works appear\r\nto have been issued from the press; among which was a Psalter and\r\nanother New Testament. In 1488, after the foundation of a regular\r\nprinting office, the whole Bohemian Bible was printed for the first\r\ntime; in the same year the History of Troy again, and the Roman\r\nchronicle; and in the following year the first Bohemian almanac, and\r\nthe Bible of Kuttenberg. The subsequent editions belong, as to time,\r\nto the following period; but are given in the note below.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_Golden age of the Bohemian Literature. From the diffusion of\r\nprinting, about A.D._ 1500, _to the battle at the White Mountain,\r\nA.D._ 1620.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly for the sake of clearness and convenience, that writers\r\non the literary history of Bohemia separate this period from the\r\nformer; in its character and its genius it was entirely the same. What\r\nthe Bohemians had _acquired_ in the one, they _possessed_ in the\r\nother; what they had only aimed at in the former, they reached in the\r\nlatter; what had been the property of a few, was now augmented by an\r\nabundant harvest in their diligent hands, and enriched a multitude.\r\nBut the objects, the stamp, the character, of both centuries were\r\nessentially the same. Literary cultivation, which during the sixteenth\r\ncentury was every where else monopolized by the clergy and a few\r\ndistinguished individuals, was now in Bohemia the common property of\r\nthe people; who for the most part embraced the evangelical doctrines\r\nin their manifold, though but little differing shades. But although\r\nreligion was to them the object of chief interest, it was yet far from\r\noccupying their minds exclusively. And this is the point, in which the\r\nhistory of the Bohemian Reformation materially differs from that of\r\nsome other countries. Luther's elevated mind did not indeed give room\r\nto narrow prejudices against those flowers of life, with which a kind\r\nCreator has adorned this earth. But almost all the other Reformers\r\nwere led, either by a one-sided zeal or by circumstances, to show\r\nthemselves decidedly opposed to the cultivation of elegant literature\r\nand the fine arts; they destroyed or banished pictures, music,\r\nstatuary, and every thing which they could in any way regard as\r\nworldly temptations to allure men from the only source of truth and\r\nknowledge; nay, they sometimes went so far as to look at science and\r\nart in themselves only in the light of handmaids to religion; and to\r\ndeem a devotion to them without such reference, as sinful worldliness.\r\nOf such narrowness we do not find a trace in the fathers of the\r\nBohemian Reformation, who were themselves men of high intellectual\r\ncultivation; and even their most zealous followers kept themselves\r\nnearly free from it. If, as we have seen in the preceding period,\r\npolitical, poetical, and religious subjects were merged in each other,\r\nit was only the necessary result of the confusion occasioned by the\r\nstruggles of the time. Where one object is predominant, all others\r\nmust naturally become subordinate; but wherever that which appears\r\namiable only as the free tendency of the whole soul, is exacted as a\r\nduty, a spiritual despotism is to be feared; of which we find very\r\nlittle in the history of Bohemian literature. The classics never were\r\nstudied with more attention and devotion, were never imitated with\r\nmore taste. Italy, the cradle of fine arts, and then the seat of\r\ngeneral cultivation, was never visited more frequently by the Bohemian\r\nnobility, than when three-fourths of the nation adhered to the\r\nProtestant Church. At the very time, too, when the Bohemian\r\nProtestants had to watch most closely their religious liberties, and\r\nto defend them against the encroachments of a treacherous court, they\r\ndid not deem it a desertion of the cause of religion to unite with the\r\nsame Romanists, whose theological doctrines they contested, in their\r\nlabours in the fields of philology, astronomy, and natural philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the Bohemian national literature increased during the\r\nsixteenth century so rapidly; the number of writers augmented so\r\nprodigiously; and the opportunities for literary cultivation presented\r\nto the reading public, by the multiplication of books through the\r\npress, became so frequent; that the difficulty of giving a condensed\r\nyet distinct picture of the time is greatly augmented. A sketch of the\r\npolitical situation of the country may serve as a back-ground, in\r\norder by its gloomy shades to render still brighter the light of a\r\nfree mental development.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of George Podiebrad in 1471, the Bohemians--or rather\r\nthe catholic party, after the pope had excommunicated this\r\nprince--elected Vladislaus, a Polish prince, for their king; who, like\r\nhis son and successor Louis, united on his head the crowns of Hungary\r\nand Bohemia. The different evangelical denominations were during these\r\nreigns in some measure tolerated; except that from time to time a\r\npersecution of one or another sect broke out, and again after a year\r\nor two was dropped, when the minds of the community had become\r\nsomewhat pacified. It is a melancholy truth for the evangelical\r\nChristian, that at this time the most violent persecutors were to be\r\nfound among the Calixtins or Utraquists. During the first years of the\r\nsixteenth century, persecution was mostly directed against the United\r\nBrethren and their writings. The latter were burned; the former\r\nbanished; until, driven from place to place, they found an asylum in\r\nthe territory of some high-minded nobleman, where they established\r\nthemselves anew; and then after some years perhaps a new persecution\r\nbegan. Of a more revolting and bloody description were the measures\r\ndirected principally against the Lutherans in the years 1522-26; in\r\nwhich the most shocking tortures were employed, and several faithful\r\nLutherans and Picardites were burned alive. During all this time the\r\nRomanists and Calixtins exercised a severe censorship; and it was\r\nordained, that every individual who brought a newly printed book into\r\nthe city of Prague, must submit it to the revision of the consistory.\r\nThese laws, however, were no better observed than all similar\r\nordinances, when directly in opposition to the spirit of the age.\r\nMeanwhile the Calixtins and Romanists, although writing against all\r\nothers, had their own mutual contests. When, however, the former\r\ncaused a new edition of the Bible to be printed in the year 1506,[28]\r\nit was unanimously adopted by the Roman Catholics also; who, as is\r\namusing to observe, did not notice that a wood cut is appended to the\r\nsixth chapter of the Apocalypse, in which the pope is represented in\r\nthe flames of hell.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1526 king Louis died in the battle of Mohaez.\r\n\r\nAccording to a matrimonial treaty, he was succeeded by his\r\nbrother-in-law Ferdinand, archduke of Austria and brother of the\r\nemperor Charles V. This prince was received by the Bohemians with\r\nreluctance as their king, and only on the condition, insisted on by\r\nthe Estates, that he should subscribe the compact of Basle, by which\r\ntheir religious liberties were secured to them. So long as Ferdinand\r\nwas occupied in Hungary against the Turks, all went well in Bohemia;\r\nbut when, in the war which followed the league of Smalkalde (1547),\r\nthe Protestants of this country refused to fight against their\r\nbrethren, a new and unremitted persecution began against all, who\r\ncould in any way be comprised under the name of _sectarians_. The\r\ncompact of Basle was strictly only in favour of the Utraquists or\r\nCalixtins; the Lutherans and Taborites, or, as they were then called,\r\nUnited Brethren, as also the Picardites and Grubenheimer, were\r\nconsidered as _sects_, and did not belong to the indulged.[29] Their\r\nchurches were shut up; their preachers arrested; and all who did not\r\nprefer to exchange their religion for the Roman Catholic, were\r\ncompelled to emigrate. The scene altered under Maximilian II,\r\nFerdinand's successor, a friend of the Reformation, and in every\r\nrespect one of the most excellent princes who ever took upon himself\r\nthe responsibility of directing the destinies of a nation; to use\r\nSchaffarik's happy metaphor, the benefits of his administration fell\r\non the field, which Ferdinand's strength had ploughed, like a mild and\r\nfertilizing rain. During his life, and the first ten years of his son\r\nRudolph's reign, Bohemia was in peace: the different denominations\r\nwere indulged; literature flourished, and the Bohemian language was at\r\nthe summit of its glory. But we regret to add, that the Protestants,\r\ninstead of improving this fortunate period by uniting to acquire a\r\nlegal foundation for their church, instead of a mere indulgence\r\ndepending on the will of the sovereign, lived in constant mutual\r\nwarfare, and attempted only to supplant each other. An ordinance in\r\n1586 against the Picardites, a name under which the Bohemian Brethren\r\nwere then comprehended; and still more the strict censorship\r\nintroduced in 1605; first aroused them to unite their strength against\r\noppression; and in 1609 they compelled the emperor to subscribe the\r\ncelebrated _Literæ Imperatoriæ_, or edict, by which full liberty in\r\nmatters of religion was secured to them. During the rest of this\r\nperiod, the Protestants remained the ruling party. The university of\r\nPrague, by the side of which from A.D. 1556 another of the Jesuits\r\nexisted, was by that treaty given entirely into their hands. This\r\ninstitution, although in consequence of the foundation of so many\r\nsimilar schools it never recovered completely from the shock it\r\nreceived in 1410, and though for more than a hundred years it had been\r\ndecidedly on the decline, yet rose in reputation towards the middle of\r\nthe sixteenth century; and among the professors who filled its chairs,\r\nthere were always celebrated names. Among the schools of a less\r\nelevated rank, those of the Bohemian Brethren at Bunzlau, Prerow, and\r\nother places, were distinguished.\r\n\r\nRudolph was a great patron of literature and science; and was quite\r\nfavourably disposed towards the Bohemian language. Nearly two hundred\r\nwriters were numbered under his reign; and among these many ladies and\r\ngentlemen of his court, of which Tycho Brahe, Kepler, and other\r\nscientific foreigners were the chief ornaments. Zeal for the\r\ncultivation of their mother tongue, seemed to be the point in which\r\nall religious denominations in Bohemia united. But during this\r\ncentury, as in the preceding one, the language of the country existed\r\nonly side by side with the Latin; which was still preferred by many,\r\nfor the sake of a more general reputation. It became the chief object\r\nof other eminent men, to make their countrymen acquainted with the\r\nclassics in a Bohemian dress; and to improve the language by a strict\r\nimitation of Latin and Greek forms. Among these a rich and noble\r\ncitizen of Prague named George Hruby must be first named;[30] also\r\nPisecky, ob. 1511, who translated Isoerates' Epistle to Demonicus;\r\nNicholas Konacz and Ulric of Welensky, the translators of Lucian;\r\nKrupsky, of Plutarch; Ginterod, of Xenophon's Cyropaedia. Kocyn,\r\ncelebrated for his eloquence and other gifts, translated the\r\necclesiastical history of Eusebius and Cassiodorus; Orliczny, the\r\nJewish wars of Josephus, several of the Latin classics, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider this general zeal for the cultivation of the\r\nlanguage, it is a matter of surprise that the first Bohemian grammar\r\nshould not be older than A.D. 1533. Its author was Benesh Optat, who\r\nalso translated Erasmus' Paraphrase of the New Testament. Another\r\ngrammar was published by Beneshowsky in 1577, a third by the Slovak\r\nBenedicti in 1603. But the individual to whom is justly assigned the\r\nchief merit in regard to the language, is Weleslawin, ob. 1599,\r\nprofessor of history in the university of Prague, and the proprietor\r\nof the greatest printing establishment in Bohemia. Partly by his own\r\nworks, original and translated, and among these three dictionaries for\r\ndifferent purposes; partly by the encouragement he gave to other\r\nwriters, and the activity with which he caused works whether old or\r\nnew deserving of a greater circulation, to be printed; he acquired a\r\nmost powerful influence among his cotemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe field however which was cultivated with the most diligence, was\r\nthat of theology; and fortunately, during this whole period, with an\r\nequal measure of talent and zeal. The writings of the Bohemian\r\nBrethren, Thomas Prelavsky, Laurentius Krasonicky, and more\r\nespecially of Lucas, belong partly to the former, partly to the\r\npresent period. The latter was a most productive writer; and as being\r\none of their best scholars, he was generally chosen to answer the\r\ncharges made against the United Brethren, in learned and elaborate\r\npamphlets.[31] Several of the productions of the Brethren, mentioned\r\nin the former period, were written and printed in the beginning of\r\nthis. Among these in 1508, Procopius' question. \"Whether it is right\r\nfor a Christian to compel infidels or heretics to embrace the true\r\nfaith?\" is remarkable, as one of the earliest instances in which this\r\nposition of intolerance was made the subject of public debate, or at\r\nleast answered in the negative. In 1563 the New Testament was first\r\ntranslated directly from the Greek, by J. Blahoslav, another\r\npresident of the Bohemian Brethren, a man of profound erudition. The\r\nfirst translation of the whole Bible from the original languages, did\r\nnot take place until several years later. The first edition of this\r\nlatter splendid work, for which the patriotic and pious baron John of\r\nZherotin expressly founded a printing office in his castle of Kralicz\r\nin Moravia, and advanced money for all the necessary expenses, was\r\nprinted in 1579. This version is still considered, in respect to\r\nlanguage, as a model; and in respect to typography, as unsurpassed.\r\nOn the fidelity of the translation and the value of the commentary,\r\nSchaffarik remarks, that \"they contain a great deal of that which,\r\ntwo hundred years later, the learned _coryphaei_ of exegesis in our\r\nday have exhibited to the world as their own profound discoveries.\"\r\nThe translators were Albert Nicolai, Lucas Helic, Joh. Aeneas, George\r\nStryc, E. Coepolla, J. Ephraim, P. Jessenius, and J. Capito.--G.\r\nStryc wrote also a good translation of the Psalms in rhyme, and\r\nseveral theological works. J. Wartowsky likewise translated the Old\r\nTestament from the Hebrew and left it in manuscript; but his version\r\nhas never been published. Of his translation of Erasmus' Paraphrase\r\nof the Gospels, only that of the Gospel of Matthew has been printed.\r\nAmong the Bohemian Brethren, Augusta surnamed Pileator, ob. 1572,\r\nStranensky, the above-mentioned Blahoslav, Zamrsky, ob. 1592, were\r\ndistinguished by great erudition. They and many others wrote\r\nvoluminous works on theological subjects, e.g. biblical researches,\r\nsystematic divinity, sermons, etc. Several of these writers, and also\r\nmany others, were authors of numerous religious hymns; among which\r\nnot a few are still considered as unsurpassed in any language.\r\nNicholas Klaudian, who was at the same time physician, printer, and\r\ntheologian, wrote an apology in favour of the Brethren. This\r\nindividual, who, besides being the printer and editor of several\r\nmedical works written by himself and others, was in part the\r\ntranslator of Seneca and Lactantius, has further the merit of having\r\npublished in 1518 the first map of Bohemia. Luther's sermons and\r\nother writings were translated into Bohemian; and the religious\r\naffairs of Germany began to excite an intense interest among all\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThe theological productions of this period written by Roman\r\nCatholics--among which we distinguish the names of Pishek surnamed\r\nScribonius, Makawsky, and the Jesuits Sturm and Hostowin--are mostly\r\nof a polemical character; while some also are translations of the\r\nfathers, especially of Augustine's writings; or original ascetic\r\nproductions in the form of allegorical novels. Among the Utraquists\r\nseveral individuals were celebrated as preachers; above all Ctibor\r\nKotwa, who was called the Bohemian Cicero, and Dicastus Mirkowsky.\r\nOthers wrote theological treatises and interpretations of portions of\r\nthe Scriptures. Such were Beransky, author of an interpretation of\r\nDaniel, of the gospels, and the epistles; Orliczny, or, as he is\r\ncalled in Latin, Aquilinas, known chiefly as a translator of the\r\nclassics;[32] Turnowsky, a Slovak by birth; Bydzhowsky, Bilegowsky the\r\nwriter of a Bohemian church history and of a history of the Hussites\r\nand Picardites; Rwaczowsky, Zeletawsky, Tesak, author of many popular\r\nreligious hymns; Palma, who published towards twenty theological\r\nworks; Peshina, Maurenin, and Borowsky, who wrote interpretations of\r\nthe epistles and gospels; Wrbensky, author of a biblical Synopsis, a\r\nHarmony, etc.; Rosacius Sushishky, distinguished as a Latin poet;\r\nMartin of Drazow, Jacobides Stribrsky, Jakesius Prerowsky. and\r\nothers.[33]\r\n\r\nThere are few among the theological writers of this century,--of whom\r\nwe have named perhaps the twentieth part,--who have not left at least\r\nten volumes of their own writings; while many have reached twice, and\r\nsome thrice the number. More than one third of the printed works in\r\nthis department contain sermons. The eloquence of the pulpit acquired\r\na high degree of cultivation; and besides the two Utraquist preachers\r\nmentioned above, many other names were celebrated among them. In\r\nrespect to erudition, however, the Brethren occupied decidedly the\r\nfirst rank. In religious hymns all sects were equally productive; and\r\nthere are, as we have mentioned already, not a few among them of a\r\nhigh excellence. To the names of spiritual poets alluded to in the\r\npreceding paragraphs, we may here add the following: T. Sobeslawsky\r\nReshatko, Gryllus, Herstein of Radowesic, Horsky, Mart. Pisecky,\r\nTaborsky, Sylvanus a Slovak by birth and called by way of eminence\r\n_Poeta Bohemicus_, Chmelowecz, Mart. Philomusa, Karlsberg, Hanush; and\r\nmore especially Lomnicky, _poeta laureatus_, who is regarded as the\r\nfirst Bohemian poet of that age.\r\n\r\nThese names comprise also nearly all we have to say of the state of\r\nBohemian poetry in general. Not that some of them did not occasionally\r\ndesert the sacred muse, and compose specimens of secular poetry; for\r\nsome of Lomnicky's larger and most celebrated works belong to this\r\nclass, as may be seen by the titles; e.g. 'The arrows of Cupid,' 'The\r\ngolden Bag,' etc.[34]\r\n\r\nBut every thing of real poetical value is of a religious character;\r\nand bears too much the stamp of its age, to be relished at the present\r\nday. The secular poets of the time wrote, with a few exceptions, in\r\nLatin.\r\n\r\nAmong the historians of merit we may name the following writers of\r\nBohemian history: Hagek of Liboczan, Kuthen, Procopius Lupacz,\r\nPaprocky a Pole who however wrote some of his works in the Bohemian\r\nlanguage, Racownicky, and the above-mentioned Weleslawin and\r\nBilegowsky. In respect to universal history, or that of other lands,\r\nwe find the names of Placel, Sixt von Ottersdorf, Konstantinovicz,\r\nKocin, and others. This period is equally rich in valuable books of\r\ntravels. Count Wratislaw of Mitrowicz, ob. 1635, described his\r\ninteresting embassy from Vienna to Constantinople; C. Harant, a\r\ncourtier and statesman, published his travels in Egypt and Palestine;\r\nPrefat of Wlkanow likewise gave a description of his journey from\r\nPrague to Palestine; Charles of Zherotin, the son of the munificent\r\npatron of the United Brethren, and like him their protector and\r\nfriend, left letters and a description of his travels.\r\n\r\nAs lawyers, orators, and political writers, the following names may be\r\nadduced: Baron Kocin of Kocinet, whom we have had occasion to mention\r\nrepeatedly; the counts Sternberg, Wratislaw of Mitrowicz, and Slawata;\r\nthe latter known as one of the persons thrown from a lofty window of\r\nthe castle by the violence of count Thurn--one of the introductory\r\nscenes of the thirty years' war; Baron Budowecz of Budow, equally\r\nexcellent as a Christian and a statesman, the protector and public\r\ndefender of the Bohemian Brethren, and faithful to his religious\r\nconviction until his last breath; Christopher Harant, another nobleman\r\nof great merit, whom we have mentioned above as a traveller in the\r\nEast. Both these last were executed in 1621. Writers of merit in the\r\ndepartment of jurisprudence, were also the counsellors Ulric of\r\nProstiborz under Ferdinand I, Wolf of Wresowicz, the chancellor\r\nKoldin, and others. But on topics like these, by far the greater\r\nnumber wrote only in Latin; and these of course we do not mention\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nWriters on the medical and natural sciences we cannot well separate;\r\nsince, in most cases, the same individuals distinguished themselves in\r\nthe departments of medicine, astronomy, and mathematics. The\r\nfollowing, along with many others, are named with distinction: Th.\r\nHagek, body physician of the emperors Maximilian and Rudolph, and a\r\ncelebrated astronomer; Zhelotyn, author of medical and mathematical\r\nworks; Zaluzhansky, physician and naturalist, who anticipated Linnæus\r\nin his doctrine of the sexual distinction and impregnation of plants;\r\nP. Codicillus, historian, philosopher, theologian, and astronomer, who\r\nwrote on all these different subjects; Huber von Reisenbach, a\r\nphysician and rector of the university of Prague; Shud, a celebrated\r\nastronomer; and many more.[35]\r\n\r\nThe number of books printed during this period cannot well be\r\nascertained; since by far the greater number were burned, or otherwise\r\ndestroyed, in the dreadful catastrophe which signalized its close.\r\nPrague alone had eighteen printing offices; and fourteen more existed\r\nin other places in Bohemia and Moravia. Besides these, many Bohemian\r\nbooks were printed at Venice, Nürnberg, Wittenberg, and some in\r\nHolland and Poland.\r\n\r\nIn 1617, the emperor Matthias succeeded in obtaining the crown of\r\nBohemia for his nephew Ferdinand, archduke of Austria. This was the\r\nsignal for the Romanists, in spite of the _Literæ Imperatoriæ_ of the\r\nemperor Rudolph, to make new attempts for the suppression of the\r\nProtestants. The Estates belonging to this denomination brought their\r\ncomplaint before the emperor, who gave them no redress; and thus the\r\nspark was kindled into flames, which for thirty years continued to\r\nrage throughout all Germany. At the death of Matthias in 1619, the\r\nBohemians refused to receive Ferdinand II as their king; and elected\r\nthe Protestant palatine Frederic V, a generous prince, but incapable\r\nof affording them support. The battle at the White Mountain, near\r\nPrague, in 1620, decided the destiny of Bohemia. Twenty-seven of the\r\nleaders of the insurrection were publicly executed; sixteen were\r\nexiled or condemned to prison for life; their property, as also the\r\npossessions of seven hundred and twenty-eight noblemen and knights,\r\nwho had voluntarily acknowledged themselves to have taken part in the\r\ninsurrection, and of twenty-nine others who had fled, was wholly\r\nconfiscated; and thus the amount of fifty-three millions of rix\r\ndollars transferred from Protestant to Romish hands. The _Literce\r\nImperatorice_ were annulled; the Protestant religion in Bohemia\r\nabolished; and that kingdom declared a purely catholic hereditary\r\nmonarchy. All non-catholic preachers were banished; thirty thousand\r\nfamilies, who preferred exile to a change of their religion,\r\nemigrated. Among them 185 were noble families; the others artists,\r\nmechanics, merchants, and labourers. Yet in the villages, among the\r\nwoods and mountains, where neither soldier nor Jesuit had penetrated,\r\nand there alone, many Protestants remained, buried in a fortunate\r\nobscurity. From the time of this catastrophe, the Bohemian language\r\nhas never again been used in public business. The thirty years' war\r\ncompleted the devastation of this unfortunate country. In 1617,\r\nBohemia had 732 cities and 34,700 villages; when Ferdinand II died in\r\n1637, there remained 130 cities and 6000 villages; and its three\r\nmillions of inhabitants were reduced to 780,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From the battle at the White Mountain, A.D_. 1620, _to the Revival of\r\nLiterature in A.D_. 1774-80.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this melancholy period we have but little to say. A dull pressure\r\nlay upon the nation; it was as if the heavy strokes inflicted on them\r\nhad paralyzed their very limbs. Innumerable monks came to Bohemia from\r\nItaly, Spain, and the south of Germany, who condemned and sacrificed\r\nto the flames every Bohemian book as necessarily heretical. There were\r\nindividuals who boasted having burned with their own hands 60,000\r\nliterary works. They broke into private houses, and took away whatever\r\nBohemian books they could find. Those which they did not burn, were\r\ndeposited in separate chambers in the convents, provided with iron\r\ngrates, bolts, and chains, drawn before the door, on which was\r\nwritten. _The Hell_. They distributed pamphlets respecting hell and\r\npurgatory, the reading of which produced derangement of mind in many\r\nweak persons; until, at last, the government was wise enough to lay a\r\nsevere prohibition upon these measures. The Bohemian emigrants indeed\r\ncontinued to have their religious books printed in their foreign\r\nhomes; but they wrote comparatively few new works. These however they\r\ncontrived to introduce into Bohemia, where they were answered by the\r\nJesuits and Capuchins in thick folio volumes, written in a language\r\nhardly intelligible. There were however some honourable exceptions\r\namong these fathers; some persons, who, independent of religious\r\nprejudices; continued to labour for the benefit of a beloved mother\r\ntongue. The Jesuits Konstanz, Steyer, and Drachovsky, wrote\r\ngrammatical works, and the two first attempted to translate the Bible\r\nanew. Plachy, ob. 1650, Libertin, and Taborsky, were distinguished\r\npreachers; Peshina, ob. 1680, Hammerschmidt, ob. 1731, and Beckowsky,\r\nob. 1725, wrote meritorious historical works; Rosa, ob. 1689, composed\r\nanother grammar and a dictionary. Others wrote in Latin; and among\r\nthese must be named the Jesuit Balbin, ob. 1688, who prepared several\r\nhistorical and bibliographical works of importance, part of which,\r\nhowever, were not published until long after his death.[36]\r\n\r\nWe turn once more to the unfortunate emigrants, and in the midst of\r\nthe distress, privations, and sacrifices, which were the natural\r\naccompaniments of their exiled condition, we rejoice to meet with a\r\nname, which owes its splendour not alone to the general poverty of the\r\nperiod; but which outshines even the most distinguished of the former\r\nage, and is indeed the only one in the literary history of Bohemia,\r\nwhich has acquired a _European_ fame. This is Comenius, the last\r\nbishop of the Bohemian Brethren. Although he belongs partly to the\r\nformer period, and, in respect to his style, decidedly to the golden\r\nage of the Bohemian. literature, the time of his principal activity\r\nfalls within this melancholy interval. A few words may be devoted to\r\nthe life of this remarkable individual. He was born A.D. 1592, in the\r\nvillage of Komna in Moravia. His baptismal names were John Amos; his\r\nfather had probably no family name, as was frequently the case at that\r\ntime among the lower classes throughout all Europe. According to the\r\ncustom of the time, he was called Komnensky from his native place, the\r\nLatin form of which is Comnenius, or more commonly Comenius. His\r\nparents, who belonged to the community of the Brethren, sent him to\r\nschool at Herborn. He distinguished himself so much as to be made\r\nrector at Prerow, when only twenty-two years old; and two years later\r\nwas transferred to Fulnck. In 1618 this latter city was plundered by\r\nthe Spaniards, and Comenius lost all his books and other property.\r\nWhen the great persecution of the Protestants broke out, he fled to\r\nPoland. Here he found many of his countrymen, of the sect of the\r\nBrethren, whom the persecutions of the former century had already\r\ndriven hither, and who had here gathered themselves into communities\r\nessentially of the same constitution; although in some measure they\r\nwere amalgamated with the dissenters in Poland. In 1632 they elected\r\nhim their bishop. In 1631 he published his _Janua linguarum\r\nreserrata_, a work which spread his fame over all the world, and which\r\nwas translated into twelve European languages, and also into Persian,\r\nArabic, and Mongolian. His object in this work was to point out a new\r\nmethod of teaching languages, by which they were to be used as keys\r\nfor acquiring other useful knowledge. In 1641 he was invited to\r\nEngland to prepare a new arrangement of the schools; but the civil war\r\nhaving prevented the execution of this project, he went from England\r\nto Sweden, whither the chancellor Oxenstiern had invited him for a\r\nsimilar purpose. After protracted journeys through half Europe, he\r\nreturned to Lissa, the principal seat of his activity. In 1659 be\r\npublished his _Orbis pictus_, the first picture-book for children\r\nwhich ever appeared, and which acquired the same reputation as the\r\nwork above-mentioned. The war and the destruction of Lissa compelled\r\nhim some years later to leave Poland; he sought another asylum in\r\nGermany, and settled at length at Amsterdam, where be died in 1671,\r\noccupied with literary pursuits until his last hour. According to\r\nAdelung, he wrote not less than ninety-two works, of which only\r\nfifty-four have come down to us; and among these, twenty are in the\r\nBohemian language. His style has a classical perfection; the contents\r\nof his works are manifold, and have mostly lost their interest for\r\nthe present age.[37] In the last years of his life Comenius is said to\r\nhave devoted himself to a mystical interpretation of the prophetic\r\nScriptures; he discovered in the Revelation of St. John the state of\r\nEurope, as it then was; awaited the millennium in the year 1672; and\r\nbelieved in the far-famed Bourignon, as an inspired prophetess.\r\n\r\nA few names only among the emigrants require to be mentioned as\r\nwriters, after Comenius. They may find their place here: Paul\r\nStransky, who was exiled in 1626 and found an asylum as professor at\r\nThorn, wrote a history of Bohemia in Latin in 1643, which was\r\ntranslated and accompanied with supplements and corrections by\r\nCornova, in 1792. Elsner, pastor of the Bohemian Brethren at Berlin,\r\nand Kleich at Zittau, printed works for religious instruction and\r\ndevotional exercises for Protestants.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of what was written during this period proceeded from\r\nthe Slovaks in Hungary, a nation related to the Bohemians in race and\r\nlanguage, who after the Reformation had adopted the Bohemian dialect\r\nas their literary language.[38] Although also constantly struggling\r\nagainst oppression and persecution, the Protestants in Hungary were\r\nnot formally annihilated, as in Bohemia; but belonged rather to the\r\ntolerated sects, so called. A certain degree of activity in behalf of\r\ntheir brethren in faith was consequently allowed to them; especially\r\nlater under Maria Theresa. We meet among them, with hardly any other\r\nthan theological productions, or works for religious edification.\r\n\r\nThe two pastors Krman and Bel, who both died towards the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, men of no inconsiderable merit as Christians and\r\nas scholars, prepared a new edition of the Bohemian Bible, and also\r\ntranslated several works of Luther, Arndt, etc. Ambrosius, their\r\ncotemporary, wrote a commentary on Luther's catechism, and several\r\nother useful religious works. G. Bahyl published an introduction to\r\nthe Bible, a history of the symbolical books, and assisted Comenius in\r\nhis _Orbus pictus_. Matthias Bahyl became the object of a cruel\r\npersecution, on account of a translation of Meissner's _Consultatio\r\northod. de fide Lutherana._ Numerous religious hymns were written in\r\nBohemian by Hrusbkowic, the two Blasius, Glosius, Augustini, and\r\nothers. Michalides translated the _Summarium biblicum_ of the\r\ntheologians of Wittenberg; and another Protestant minister, Dolezhal,\r\nwrote in 1746 a Bohemian grammar. But their books, with a few\r\nexceptions, were little read beyond the frontiers of Hungary; and had\r\nconsequently little or no influence on the Bohemians. The works\r\nwritten in the Slovakian dialect do not belong here.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_Revival of Bohemian Literature, from A.D_. 1774-80 _to the present\r\ntime_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 1774, the marshal count Kinsky published a work on the\r\nadvantages and necessity of a knowledge of the Bohemian language. At\r\nthat time so great was the neglect of the mother tongue, that even for\r\na work of so patriotic a nature, he had to employ a foreign language\r\nin order to be understood! One year later appeared an apology for the\r\nvernacular tongue of the country, written a hundred years before by\r\nthe Jesuit Balbin in Latin,[39] and edited by Pelzel. These two\r\nwritings created a deep sensation; and even the government would seem\r\nto have taken notice of them. We find, at least, that in the same year\r\nteachers of the Bohemian language were appointed in the university of\r\nVienna and in two other institutions in that city. At the same time,\r\nthe royal normal school at Prague began to print several Bohemian\r\nbooks for instruction. When the tolerant views and principles by which\r\nJoseph II was actuated, became known, more than a hundred thousand\r\nconcealed Protestants immediately appeared; their hidden books were\r\nbrought to light again; and many works, of which only single copies\r\nexisted, were reprinted. In 1781 the severe edict of Ferdinand II was\r\nrepealed, and a censorship established upon more reasonable\r\nprinciples. In 1786, the Bohemian language had gained friends enough\r\nto induce the government to institute a Bohemian theatre; which, with\r\na short interruption during the present century, has ever since\r\nexisted. The unfortunate system of general centralization adopted by\r\nJoseph II, was on the whole not favourable to the cultivation of any\r\nbut the German language; but during the reign of his two successors,\r\nthe Bohemian received more encouragement. In 1793 a professorship for\r\nthe language and literature of the country was founded in the\r\nuniversity of Prague; the use of that language in all the schools was\r\nordained by several decrees of the government; and by a law of A.D.\r\n1818, a knowledge of it was made a necessary qualification for holding\r\nany office.\r\n\r\nIn the very outset of this revival of Bohemian literature, there\r\nappeared so great a multitude of writers; such habits of diligence and\r\nproductiveness were immediately manifested throughout the whole\r\nnation; and such a mass of respectable talent was brought to light;\r\nthat the long interval of a dull and deathlike silence, which\r\npreceded this period, presents indeed an enigma difficult to be\r\nsolved. No small influence may be ascribed to Germany. The principles\r\nof the government were changed; the country, physically as well as\r\nmorally exhausted, could recover but gradually; but all this could not\r\ncreate talents where there were none; nor could all external\r\noppression and unfavourable conjunctures destroy the germs of real\r\ntalent, if they had been there. The list of modern Bohemian writers of\r\nmerit is very extensive; but we must be satisfied with bringing\r\nforward the most distinguished of them, and refer the reader to works\r\nless limited than these pages, where he may find more complete\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nAmong those whose desert is the greatest in respect to the revival of\r\nBohemian literature, Kramerius, born 1753, ob. 1808, must be named\r\nfirst. He was one of those indefatigable and creative minds, which\r\nnever sleep, never lose a moment, and by a restless activity and happy\r\ningenuity know how to render the difficult easy,--the apparently\r\nimpossible, practicable. From the year 1785, he was editor of the\r\nfirst Bohemian newspaper; from 1788, of the annual called the\r\n_Toleranz Kalender_, or Almanac of Toleration; and published besides\r\nthis more than fifty works, written by himself and others, but\r\naccompanied with notes or commentaries of his own. None of his\r\nproductions surpassed mediocrity; but according to the best judges,\r\nthey were well and perspicuously written; they became popular and\r\nexerted a very favourable influence.\r\n\r\nAs literary historians, Slavic philologians and antiquaries, Pelzcl,\r\nProchazka, Durich, Puchmayer, Negedly, Jungmann, Tomsa, Hanka, and\r\nabove all Dobrovsky, must be distinguished. One of the principal\r\nmerits of most of these scholars consists in their preparing for the\r\npress and editing valuable old manuscripts; or in the judicious\r\ncommentaries which they added to new editions of ancient works already\r\nprinted. Pelzel we have named above as the editor of the writings of\r\nthe Jesuit Balbin. Most of his works are in German, but some also in\r\nBohemian. In 1804 Prochazka and Durich translated the Bible for Roman\r\nCatholics; the former had already translated the New Testament in\r\n1786. His principal labours besides this were in the department of\r\nhistory. Durich wrote in Latin; but his researches were nevertheless\r\ndevoted to the Bohemian language and history. Tomsa and Negedly have\r\nwritten Bohemian grammars, and several other Slavic-philological works\r\nand essays.[40] Puchmayer published a large collection of poetry,[41]\r\nconsisting partly of his own productions, a token of the reviving\r\npoetical genius of the nation, which had slept for centuries; while\r\nhis elaborate Russian grammar is also a valuable contribution to\r\nSlavic literature in general.\r\n\r\nJoseph Jungmann, besides a translation of Chauteaubriand's Atala and\r\nof Milton's Paradise Lost, which Bowring calls \"the most admirable\r\namong the many admirable versions of that renowned and glorious\r\nheroic,\" [42] has written many important essays scattered in\r\nperiodicals; and also published in 1820 a Bohemian chrestomathy, in\r\n1825 a history of Bohemian literature, and in 1830-31 a complete\r\ndictionary of that language.\r\n\r\nW. Hanka. librarian at Prague, has made himself particularly known by\r\ncritical editions of valuable writings out of the golden age of\r\nBohemian literature. In 1817 he was so fortunate as to discover a\r\nmanuscript of high importance, as well in a philological respect, as\r\nfor its intrinsic poetical value; which he published in 1819 with a\r\nmodern Bohemian translation, and also a German translation by\r\nSwoboda.[43] He has written several works, and also essays in\r\nperiodicals, of a bibliographical and antiquarian character.\r\n\r\nJoseph Dobrovsky, born 1753 in Hungary, but of Bohemian parents, ob.\r\n1829, is called the patriarch of modern Slavic literature, and was one\r\nof the profoundest scholars of the age. His merits in regard to Slavic\r\nphilology and history are so generally acknowledged, and we have so\r\noften had occasion to cite his name in these pages, and to refer the\r\nreader to his authority, that without attempting to present a critical\r\nview of one, or an analysis of another of his works, we are contented\r\nto give in a note the title of his principal works. We are the more\r\nwilling to adopt this course, because the most of his works form in a\r\ncertain measure one great whole, and mutually supply each other; and\r\nbecause too, the author having in part first explored unknown regions,\r\nand having of course sometimes found it necessary to retract\r\nhypotheses started in his earlier writings, his works cannot well be\r\nseparated. He wrote mostly in German; sometimes in Latin; while\r\ncomparatively very few of his numerous books are in the Bohemian\r\nlanguage. In this way only could they gain that kind of universality,\r\nwhich the subject required; and which has so much contributed to\r\npromote the cause of Slavic literature in general.[44]\r\n\r\nThere were also some scholars among the Slovaks, who aided the same\r\ncause with diligence and talent. Leska, ob. 1818, published from 1785\r\nonward the first Slovakian newspaper, and was a diligent and judicious\r\ncompiler in respect to Slavic lexicography. Palkowicz published a\r\nBohemian dictionary, and prepared in 1808 a more correct edition of\r\nthe Bible. Plachy, besides many volumes of prose and poetry, published\r\na valuable periodical; Schramko wrote some philological works;\r\nSchaffarik and Kollar, of whom more will be said in the sequel, were\r\nalso Slovaks.\r\n\r\nAfter the collection of poetry by Puchmayer above alluded to, several\r\nothers of a miscellaneous kind appeared; poetry having been hitherto\r\nlimited almost exclusively to religious purposes. Kamaryt, Palacky,\r\nChmelensky, Zdirad Polak, Czelakowsky, Snaidr, Hnewkowsky, Turinsky,\r\nStulcz,[45] Jablonsky, Tupi, Sabin, are favourably known as poets. A.\r\nMarek has translated several dramas of Shakspeare; Machaczek several\r\nfrom Goethe; Kliczpera, Stepanek, and Sychra, are esteemed dramatic\r\nwriters. Among the Slovaks, Holli translated the Latin and Greek\r\nelegiac poets; Roshnay, Anaereon.\r\n\r\nAs historical writers Tomek and Jordan must be honourably mentioned.\r\nAn excellent work on Bohemian Antiquities, written in German by J.E.\r\nWocel, ought also to be noticed.[46]\r\n\r\nIn the department of natural science are to be mentioned, Presl, count\r\nBerchtold, Strnad, Sedlaczek, Wydra, Smetana, etc. Others, Bohemians\r\nby birth, have written in German, e.g. Haenke, Sieber, etc. etc. Count\r\nBuquoy also is of Bohemian origin.--Writers of merit on moral and\r\nreligious subjects are, Rautenkranz, Zahradnik, Parizek, and others.\r\nThe Slovak Bartholomaeides, a distinguished scholar, has written\r\nseveral useful works on various topics.--Periodicals full of learned\r\nresearches and variety of interest were edited, _Dobraslaw_ by\r\nHromadko and Ziegler, _Krok_ by Presl, etc. Modern journals of a more\r\ngeneral tendency are _Wlastimil_ (the Patriot), _Dennica_, etc. Among\r\nthe highest nobility the national language found powerful patrons; and\r\nin the establishment of a national Museum, a Bohemian Academy of\r\nSciences, and similar patriotic institutions, the national literature\r\nreceived great encouragement. One of the principal objects of this\r\ninstitution was to publish old works and to patronize new ones. Its\r\nfirst publication was an old treatise on Bohemian law.[47] The names\r\nof the counts K. Sternberg and Kolowrath-Liebsteinsky must be\r\nmentioned here; to which, in our days, may be added those of the\r\ncounts J.M. and Leo Thun.\r\n\r\nThe leading poet of the present day in the Bohemian language is J.\r\nKollar, born 1793 at Thurocz in Hungary. In 1821 he published a volume\r\nof poems; and some years later a larger beautiful poem in two cantos,\r\ncalled _Slawy dzery_, the Daughter of Glory, by which he meant\r\n_Slavina_, or the Slavic nations personified; for _Slava_ means glory.\r\nWith talents of the first order, and at the same time purely national,\r\nhe imitates Petrarch in some measure; making his nation his Laura,\r\npraising her beauty, and prophesying her ultimate triumph.[48]\r\n\r\nThe patriotic zeal which in our days has instigated the Slavic\r\nscholars to follow out the traces of their language and history into\r\nthe remotest past, in order to clear up more satisfactorily the origin\r\nand primitive connection between the different members of the great\r\nSlavic family, and their relative position to the Germans, has nowhere\r\nbeen exhibited in a more energetic and disinterested way than in\r\nBohemia. The idea of Panslavism was here first worked out\r\nsystematically.[49] If we are not entirely mistaken, it was the same\r\nKollar, the Czekho-Slovakian poet, who first conceived, or at least\r\nexpressed, that idea. In a Slavic periodical, published in Hungary,\r\nentitled _Hronka_, he came out with an address to his Slavic brethren,\r\nwhich he himself translated into German. He urged the Slavi to drop\r\ntheir numerous intellectual family feuds; to consider themselves as\r\n_one_ great nation; their mutual languages essentially as _one_; their\r\nrespective interests as one. He prophesied power and predominance to\r\nthe Slavi _united_ as a whole. The idea was seized with eagerness;\r\nespecially by the Bohemian scholars, in whom a certain irritation\r\nagainst the Germans, the oppressors of their nation for centuries, was\r\nfar from being unnatural. At the head of this movement, so far as it\r\nrespects philological investigations, was P.J. Schaffarik; in respect\r\nto historical researches, Fr. Palacky; the first a Slovak, the second\r\na Moravian by birth; and both of them highly esteemed as scholars of\r\ngreat learning, uncommon acuteness, and indefatigable research; but\r\nboth also, from a very laudable national partiality, inclined to\r\nfavour those results of their researches, which should serve to\r\nsupport their own patriotic or Panslavic views. It will therefore not\r\nbe found surprising, that they should have met with a strong, nay\r\npassionate opposition.\r\n\r\nSchaffarik, whose valuable work on the Slavic languages and their\r\nhistory we have chiefly consulted in our present sketch, (not however\r\nwithout due regard to his own altered and corrected views, as given to\r\nthe public in his later works,) was born in 1795 at Kbeljarowo in\r\nNorthern Hungary. He received a German education; and, following the\r\nexample of other leading Slavic scholars, like Dobrovsky and Kopitar,\r\nnotwithstanding his partiality for all that is Slavic, he wrote most\r\nof his earlier works in German. His \"History of the Slavic Language\r\nand Literature,\" although a production of his youth, and written\r\nbefore the full maturity of the author's views, has perhaps\r\ncontributed more than any other work to a knowledge of the Slavic\r\nliterature in general, and of the classification and mutual relation\r\nof the Slavic languages. After further researches, he prepared a\r\n\"History of the Southern Slavi;\" which however, so far as we are\r\ninformed, has never been printed. Instead of it he published a work on\r\n\"Slavic Antiquities\" in the Bohemian language. It was patriotism which\r\ninduced him not only to choose this language in preference to the\r\nGerman, and thus give up a far greater field of influence; but he also\r\ndeclined a well endowed Slavic professorship in the university of\r\nBerlin, from the same generous and patriotic motive, and settled in\r\nPrague. Here he undertook the editorship of a periodical founded by\r\nPalacky; and operated in connection with him and other Slavic scholars\r\nfor the promotion of Slavic, and principally Bohemian, literature. For\r\nthis end a society was founded among the Bohemian and Slovakian\r\nscholars and gentry, called the _Stalci_, the Constant. They bound\r\nthemselves to buy every respectable book, which should be printed in\r\nthe Bohemian language. In 1842 Schaffarik published a \"Slavic\r\nEthnography,\" a small introductory work, but founded on extensive\r\nstudies. Of this he himself prepared a German translation.[50]\r\n\r\nThe faithful fellow-labourer of Schaffarik is Francis Palacky, a\r\nscholar of great diligence and research, a few years younger in age;\r\nwho however seems to have adopted an opposite course, in so far as his\r\nearly works were written in Bohemian, while his later and principal\r\nones are in German. In 1829 he was appointed Historiographer of\r\nBohemia by the Estates; but he was too warm a _Bohemian_ to hope for\r\nthe confirmation of the Austrian government under the emperor Francis,\r\nand it was not obtained until under his successor. By means of the\r\n\"Journal of the Bohemian National Museum,\" of which he was the founder\r\nand editor, he had early gained a leading voice in all that concerned\r\nthe revival of Bohemian literature; and, in that capacity, had to\r\nfight his way through a series of literary struggles and combats,\r\nsometimes conducted with personal vehemence and bitterness. He had the\r\nsatisfaction, however, of finally coming off as victor in the more\r\nessential points. His most important work is his _History of Bohemia_;\r\nof which two volumes were published in the German language in 1836. A\r\nBohemian edition, with additions and a historiographical introduction,\r\nappeared in 1848.\r\n\r\nThe spirit which pervades this great work makes the author to a\r\ncertain extent the representative of his nation. One of the objects of\r\nthe work is to point out the _primitive_ relations of Slavism on the\r\none hand, and of Germanism, the heir of Romanism, on the other; their\r\ncontrasts and necessary conflicts; the Germans, warlike, conquering,\r\noppressing all their neighbours, and bearing the germs of privileged\r\ncastes in their earliest institutions; the Slavi, peaceful,\r\nindustrious, living in patriarchal communities, and in their\r\nfundamental elements purely democratic. Hence, the author says, the\r\nprincipal idea and fundamental feature of Bohemian history is the\r\nuninterrupted clashing and struggle of Slavism and Germanism; and in\r\nanother place he remarks, that \"the history of Bohemia consists\r\nchiefly in the combat with Germanism; or in the alternate reception\r\nand rejection by the Czekhes of German manners and institutions.\" [51]\r\n\r\nOur own days have witnessed the enthusiasm with which the thought of a\r\ntotal separation between Slavism and Germanism was received, when the\r\nevents of the month of March 1848 seemed to open an unexpected\r\nprospect of realizing a long cherished idea. A great congress of all\r\nthe Slavic nations was convoked at Prague. But at that very moment, at\r\nthe gathering together of so many members of that wide-spread family,\r\nit became strikingly apparent that they were a _family_ of nations;\r\nbut could never again become, what for thousands of years they had not\r\nbeen, _one_ nation. In order to be understood, several of their\r\ndeputies had to speak in German; and even for the journal founded as\r\nthe great central organ of Slavism, the _German_ language had to be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic efforts made to prevent the Bohemian language from\r\ngradually yielding to the German, are honourable and laudable; but\r\nwhether they will have any ultimate result seems to be quite doubtful.\r\nThe times indeed are somewhat changed, since Jungmann called the\r\npresent literature of Bohemia \"the produce of a few enthusiasts, who,\r\nexposing themselves to the hatred of their enemies and the ingratitude\r\nof their countrymen, have devoted themselves to the resuscitation of a\r\nlanguage, neither living nor dead.\" Twenty-five years have brought on\r\na great revolution; and those enthusiasts are no longer \"a few.\" But\r\nthey have still a hard combat to fight. It may be doubtful whether\r\ntheir strength will hold out to struggle against the torrent of time;\r\nwhich, in its resistless course, overwhelms the nations, and only\r\nthrows their vestiges in scattered fragments on the banks, as feeble\r\nmemorials to show to an inquiring posterity that they once\r\nexisted.[52]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE AND LITERATURE OF THE SLOVAKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe northwestern part of Hungary is inhabited by the Slovaks, a Slavic\r\nnation, who appear to be the direct descendants of the original Slavic\r\nsettlers in Europe. Numerous colonists of the same race are scattered\r\nall over the other parts of that country. The Byzantine historians,\r\nand, somewhat later, the Russian annalist Nestor, speak of the region\r\non the north of the Danube as being the primitive seat of the Slavi.\r\nIn early times the _Sarmatae limigantes_ or _Jazyges metanastae_,\r\nnomadic tribes between the Danube and the Theiss, whose name indicates\r\nincontestably their having been Slavi,[53] are mentioned as having\r\ntroubled the Byzantine empire. But they soon disappeared entirely from\r\nhistory, and it is not before the ninth century, when they were\r\nalready Christians, that we meet them again. At that time Slovakia, in\r\nSlavic _Slovansko_, viz. the regions adjacent to the two rivers Waag\r\nand Gran, reappears as an ingredient part of the ephemeral kingdom of\r\ngreat Moravia. The rest of Pannonia was inhabited by other Slavic\r\ntribes, by Bulgarians, Rumelians and Khazares. In A.D. 894, the\r\nMagyars conquered Pannonia, drove back the Slovaks into the mountains,\r\nand made them tributary; whilst they themselves settled on the plains.\r\nBut although the Slovaks appear to have submitted to their fate, and\r\nto have thenceforth lived on good terms with their conquerors, it\r\ncannot unconditionally be said that the two nations were merged in\r\neach other; since, even after nearly a thousand years have passed,\r\nthey still speak different languages. The Magyars learned the arts of\r\npeace from the Slavi; who, besides being already Christians, had built\r\nmany cities, and were mechanics, traders, agriculturists. All words\r\nand terms relating to these occupations, the Magyars had to obtain\r\nfrom them. The Slovaks on their side lost their national existence in\r\nthat of their Asiatic conquerors, entered into their ranks as\r\nsoldiers, and participated thence-forward in all their fortunes; but\r\nthe influence of the Magyars on their language could be only\r\ninconsiderable, since the circle of new ideas which the Slovaks had to\r\nreceive in exchange from them, barbarians as they were, could be only\r\nvery limited. The language however is the only remnant of their\r\nnational existence which the Slovaks have preserved; in every other\r\nrespect they belong to the Hungarian nation, of which they form an\r\ningredient part, as the Magyars form another; and on the glory of\r\nwhose valiant deeds they have an equal claim.\r\n\r\nHungary, traversed by two large rivers, the Danube and the Theiss, is\r\ndivided into four great districts, usually called this side the Danube\r\nand beyond the Danube, this side the Theiss and beyond the Theiss. The\r\ndistrict this side the Theiss is the principal seat of the Slovaks.\r\nThe counties Trencsin, Thurocz, Arva, Liptau, and Sohl, are entirely\r\ninhabited by them, amounting to about 550,000 in number. In the other\r\ncounties of the same district they live more mingled with Russniaks\r\nand Magyars; and, together with the numerous Slovakish settlements\r\nwhich are scattered over all Hungary, are computed in all at about\r\n1,800,000. About 1,300,000 of them are Roman Catholics, and the\r\nremaining 500,000 Protestants.\r\n\r\nThe Slovakish language, exposed through the geographical situation of\r\nthe nation, to the influence of various other Slavic idioms--as the\r\nPolish, Bohemian, Malo-Russian, Servian, and Vindish--is more broken\r\nup into different dialects than perhaps any living tongue. In its\r\noriginal elements it is very nearly related to the Old Slavic\r\nlanguage;[54] a fact which is easy to be explained, when we consider\r\nthat the development of this language must have been the result of the\r\nprimitive cultivation of the Slavi; and that the region about the\r\nCarpathian mountains, the seat of the ancient as well as of the\r\npresent Slovaks, was the cradle of all the Slavic nations which are\r\nnow spread over the whole of eastern Europe. Of all living Slavic\r\ntongues, the Bohemian is the nearest related to the Slovakish,\r\nespecially as it appears in the oldest Bohemian writers; a\r\ncircumstance which induced Dobrovsky at first to consider both\r\nlanguages as essentially the same; or rather to maintain, that the\r\nSlovakish was nothing more than Old Bohemian. But after entering more\r\ndeeply into the subject, he found reason to regard the Slovakish idiom\r\nas a separate dialect, which forms the link of connection between\r\nthe Bohemian and Croatian-Vindish dialects, or between the two\r\nprincipal divisions, the Eastern and Western stems, of the great\r\nSlavic family.[55]\r\n\r\nTo enumerate the features by which the Slovakish dialects are\r\ndistinguished from the other Slavic languages, would oblige us to\r\nenter more into detail than would be acceptable to persons not\r\nacquainted with any of them; as we may suppose to be the case with\r\nmost of our readers. Besides, most of the peculiarities which could be\r\nalleged as _general_ characteristics, are contradicted by so many\r\nsingle cases, that all general rules would be in danger of being\r\nrendered void by a plurality of exceptions. The only thing which\r\nbelongs to the Slovaks alone, and is not common to any of the other\r\nSlavic tongues, is a variety of diphthongs where all the rest have\r\nsimple vowels; e.g. _kuoñ_, horse, for _koñ; lieucz_, light, for\r\n_lucz_, etc. In the counties situated on the frontiers of Galicia, the\r\nSlovakish language participates in many of the peculiarities of the\r\nPolish tongue; on the frontier of Moravia, the dialect of the people\r\napproaches nearer to the vernacular idiom of that province, and\r\nconsequently to the Bohemian; which has been adopted as their own\r\nliterary language. On the Slovaks who live more in the interior of the\r\ncountry, the influence of the Magyars, or of the Transylvanian-Germans,\r\nor of the Russniaks, or of the Servians, is more or less prominent,\r\naccording to their locality. The less exposed to the influence of\r\nother races, the purer of course has the proper Slovakian idiom\r\nbeen preserved, But even in its purest state, it has, as we mentioned\r\nabove, a strong and decided resemblance to the Bohemian tongue; from\r\nwhich it is however distinguished by a more harmonious and pleasing\r\nsound; its vowels being fuller and occurring more frequently. But a\r\npeculiarity which distinguishes it more materially, is a treasure of\r\nwords and phrases obsolete or entirely unknown in the present Bohemian\r\nlanguage; although they were to be found in the old Bohemian, and are\r\nso still, in part, in the Old Slavic, Russian, and Vindish dialects.\r\nSchaffarik mentions that G. Rybay, a minister in the county of Bacz,\r\nwho possessed many valuable manuscripts, had collected 15,000 words\r\nfor a Slovakish _Idioticon_, and that it would be easy to enlarge this\r\nnumber.[56]\r\n\r\nThe Slovakish language has never been a literary language; the first\r\nattempt to render it so, with a few trifling exceptions, was made\r\nabout forty years ago; but the opposition which it met with from the\r\nliterati who had already adopted the kindred Bohemian tongue for their\r\nliterary language, together with the political obstacles which it had\r\nto encounter from the jealousy of the Magyars, seems to have been too\r\nstrong to be conquered. Indeed, in consequence of this jealousy of the\r\nMagyars, the Slovakish language is so far oppressed, that even in the\r\nhigher schools of the Slovaks themselves this language is not\r\npermitted to constitute a branch of instruction, like the Hungarian\r\nand Latin. Schaffarik thinks it probable, that in ancient times the\r\nvernacular tongue of the counties inhabited by Slovaks was used in\r\npublic documents and similar writings; and that such historical\r\nmonuments must be buried in the libraries and archives of the catholic\r\narchbishops, noblemen, and cities.[57] But this subject has never been\r\nsufficiently examined. The historical popular songs, which nearly a\r\nhundred years ago were familiar to the Slovakian peasants, and some of\r\nwhich appear to have been derived even from the pagan period, have\r\nperished, with the exception of a few initial verses.[58]\r\n\r\nThere is no trace known to be left of the mental existence of this\r\nnation of nearly two millions of souls, until the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century. At that time a great body of Hussites, who were\r\nexiled from Bohemia, broke into Upper Hungary, and, under the conduct\r\nof Giskra von Brandeis, were hired by the queen Elizabeth against the\r\nrival Polish-Hungarian monarch Vladislaus, afterwards king of Bohemia.\r\nThe Bohemian soldiers were accompanied by their wives and children,\r\nand settled finally in different parts of Hungary, Other Taboritic\r\ncolonists followed them, and amalgamated gradually with the Slovaks,\r\namong whom they principally established themselves. It is probable,\r\nthat at this time the Slovaks became familiar with the Bohemian as a\r\nliterary language; which from its kindred genius and its similarity of\r\nforms was perfectly intelligible, and must have been highly acceptable\r\nto them. When the doctrines of the German Reformers penetrated into\r\nHungary, they found the Slovaks already so well prepared, that those\r\ndoctrines were at once spread among the people by numerous books\r\nwritten by Slovakian clergymen in the Bohemian language. The Bible and\r\nthe liturgical books were written and printed in Bohemian; and many\r\nBohemians and Moravians came into Hungary as preachers and teachers.\r\nThus the dominion of the Bohemian language over the pulpit, and, since\r\n_all_ the Slovakian writers of this period were clergymen, in the\r\nrepublic of letters also, was established among the Slovaks without\r\nstruggle. There is nothing known of any catholic Slovakish writers\r\nat this period; if there were any, they probably followed the beaten\r\ntrack, and wrote also in Bohemian or in Latin. But the produce of the\r\nliterary cultivation of the Slovaks during the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries, is at most but small: for the times appear to\r\nhave been too heavy, and men's minds too much oppressed, for a free\r\ndevelopment of their powers. The civil wars, the devastations of the\r\nTurks, the religious controversies, and after the battle at the White\r\nMountain, religious oppression and persecution, chased the peaceful\r\nmuses from Pannonia, and put the genius of the people in chains. All\r\nthe productions of these two centuries, with a few exceptions, are\r\nconfined to theology, and are mostly sermons, catechisms, devotional\r\nexercises, or religious hymns. Schaffarik observes, that from these\r\nlatter there speaks a melancholy gloomy spirit, crying for divine aid\r\nand deliverance.[59] Among the clergymen who during the first half of\r\nthe eighteenth century exerted themselves for the diffusion of\r\nbiblical knowledge, were Matth. Bel and D. Krman, who prepared a new\r\nedition of the Bible; G. Ambrosius and G. Babyl, authors of\r\ntheological commentaries, etc. Those Slovakian writers who in any\r\nmeasure distinguished themselves, have been enumerated under their\r\nproper heads in our sketch of the Bohemian literature.[60]\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian dialect, as we have mentioned repeatedly, is perfectly\r\n_intelligible_ to the Slovaks. But as it is not to them the language\r\nof common conversation, it cannot be _familiar_ to their minds. If, in\r\nlistening to their preachers in the churches, the people succeed in\r\nstraining up their minds sufficiently to enable them to follow the\r\ncourse of the sermons and devotional exercises, it still seems rather\r\nunnatural, that even their prayer books, destined for private use,\r\nshould not be written in their vernacular tongue; but that even\r\ntheir addresses to the Most High, which, more than any thing else,\r\nshould be the free and natural effusions of their inmost feelings,\r\nshould require such an intellectual exertion and an artificial\r\ntransposition into a foreign clime. It is a singular fact, that,\r\nwhilst every where else Protestantism and the friends of the Bible\r\nhave advocated and attempted to raise the dialect of the people, in\r\nopposition to a privileged idiom of the priesthood, among the Slovaks\r\nthe vindication of the vernacular tongue has been attempted by the\r\nRomanists, and has met with strong opposition from the Protestants. In\r\nthe year 1718, Alex Macsay, a catholic clergyman, published sermons at\r\nTyrnau, written in the common Slovakian dialect. The Jesuits of Tyrnau\r\nfollowed his example, in publishing books of prayers and several other\r\nreligious works, in a language which is rather a mixture of the\r\ndialect of the people and the literary Bohemian language. During the\r\nlast ten years of the eighteenth century, a more successful attempt\r\nwas made to elevate the Slovakian dialect spoken on the frontiers of\r\nMoravia, and which approaches the Bohemian language most, to the rank\r\nof a literary language. At the head of this undertaking were the Roman\r\ncatholic curates Bajza, Fandli, and Bernolak, especially the last. A\r\nsociety was formed, the members of which bound themselves to buy the\r\nbooks written in Slovakish by Bernolak and his friends. The Romanists\r\nproceeded in the work with great zeal and activity, and were\r\npatronized by the cardinal Rudnay, primate of Hungary; who himself\r\npublished some of his orations held in the Slovakian dialect, and\r\ncaused a voluminous Slovakish dictionary, a posthumous work of\r\nBernolak's, to be printed.[61] A version of the Bible in the same\r\ndialect, made by the canon G. Palkowicz, who is also the author of\r\nthe fourth volume of the above dictionary, was printed in the year\r\n1831.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant Slovaks, who several centuries ago had already acquired\r\nby their own contributions the right of citizens in the Bohemian\r\nrepublic of letters,--especially during the course of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, when most of the native Bohemians had been banished from\r\nit,--feared to endanger the cause of literature itself by innovations\r\nof this kind. They too united themselves into a society, and founded a\r\nprofessorship of Bohemian-Slovakian literature at the Lyceum of\r\nPressburg, which was occupied by another G. Palkowicz, honorably\r\nmentioned in our History of Bohemian literature.[62] The number of\r\nProtestant Slovaks being comparatively small, this institution was not\r\nsustained longer than ten years. To the names of the principal\r\nSlovakish-Bohemian writers during this and the last century, which\r\nhave been given above,[63] we add here those of Bartholomæides,\r\nTablicz, Lovich, and Moshotzy, themselves writers of merit, or\r\npromoters of literature and science.\r\n\r\nMany among the Slovaks, like many of their brethren the Magyars, and\r\namong other Slavi the Bohemians and Illyrians, have received a German\r\neducation, and have that language at command. For the sake of more\r\nfame, or a larger field of influence, these mostly prefer to write in\r\nGerman. Among them was Schaffarik; until, from a principle of\r\npatriotism, he adopted the Bohemian.[64]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: More generally contracted into _Böhmen._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The country along the banks of the Upper Vistula.\r\nAccording to other writers, Belo-Chrobatia was the name of the country\r\non both sides of the Carpathian chain.

According to Dobrovsky, who formed his\r\njudgment from the writing, this remarkable manuscript belongs to the\r\ninterval from about A.D. 1290 to A.D. 1310. By the numbering of the\r\nchapters and books into which it is divided, it appears that the\r\ncollection comprised three volumes; and that the manuscript thus\r\naccidentally rescued from oblivion, is only a small part of the third\r\nvolume.

The most absurd fables came through him into the early\r\nhistory of Bohemia. During the late rule of prince Metternich, this\r\nwork was considered by the censors as too ultra-national, and was put\r\non the list of the forbidden books.

Not only all books written by the Hussites or their\r\nimmediate predecessors, but even many catholic writers also of that\r\nperiod were put upon this list; e.g. the historian Hagek, translations\r\nof Æneas Sylvius, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Ann, queen of England, sister to king Wenceslaus of\r\nBohemia, possessed a Bible in Latin, German and Bohemian; to which\r\ncircumstance Wickliffe alluded in one of his writings, quoted by Huss\r\nin his reply to Stockes, Tom.

In modern times the genuine Roman letters have nearly\r\nsupplanted them; to which several different signs are added to adapt\r\nthem to the Slavic sounds. The Bohemian alphabet can only be said to\r\nhave forty-two letters, in so far as the same letter with or without a\r\nsign can be considered as two different letters. The English alphabet\r\nwould be almost without number, if all the three or four modes of\r\npronunciation connected with one and the same letter in that language,\r\nwere indicated by certain signs, and these signs made three or four\r\nletters out of one.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: The Bohemian writings of Huss are extant partly in\r\nmanuscript, partly in single printed pamphlets, but have never been\r\ncollected. They consist of sermons, hymns, letters to his friends,\r\npostillae, and other interpretations of the Scriptures, etc. His\r\ncomplete Latin works were first printed in Wittenberg 1558, and\r\nrepeatedly afterwards. They contain many pieces which were originally\r\nwritten in Bohemian; as were also the letters which Luther caused to\r\nbe printed with a preface of his own, Wittenberg 1536. Luther\r\ntranslated several of his hymns. The letters written by Huss from the\r\nprison at Constance are the expressions of a pure and elevated mind,\r\nand present the best evidence of his spotless Christian character.\r\nSome of them might serve as beautiful specimens of the sublime.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: These interesting letters, containing all the\r\ncircumstances of Jerome's last days and death, his eloquent speeches\r\nbefore the Council and a full account of the despicable conduct of his\r\naccusers, may be found at large in Shepherd's Life of Poggio\r\nBracciolini.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: See Dobrovsky's _Geschichte der böhm, Sprache_, p. 201.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: In a polemic satirical pamphlet the question was\r\nstarted: \"Master, tell me what birds are the best, those which eat and\r\ndrink, or those which eat and do not drink? and why are those which\r\neat but do not drink, enemies to those which eat and drink?\" A Latin\r\npamphlet which decided for those which do not drink, was followed by a\r\nBohemian refutation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: This manuscript, one of the most remarkable of the age,\r\nis in the library of Jena.

They were frequently confounded with\r\nthe Taborites, among whom at last the remnants of them became lost.\r\nThe Grubenheimer were the remnants of the Waldenses, who fled to\r\nBohemia in the middle of the 14th century; where, under persecution\r\nand ridicule, they used to hide themselves in caves and pits,\r\n_Gruben_; hence their name. Under the shield of the Reformation they\r\nthought themselves safe; but met only with new oppressors and\r\npersecutors. There were numerous other sects, and still more different\r\nnames of one and the same sect. A sect of the Taborites, for instance,\r\nfounded by Nicholas Wlasenicky, were alternately called _Miculassenci_\r\n(i.e. Nicolaites, the Bohemian form for Nicholas being Miculass), or\r\n_Wlasenitzi_, from his name; _Pecynowshi_, from the place of their\r\nmeetings; and _Plachtiwi_, i.e. the crying, from their manner. See\r\nDobrovsky's _Gesch. der böhm. Sprache_, p. 234. It may be the place\r\nhere to remark, that the Calixlins or Utraquists, although at first\r\ndecidedly against the infallibility of the pope, nevertheless in\r\nforming the compact of Basle, submitted in the main to the doctrine of\r\nRome, with these four conditions; viz. the free distribution of the\r\nBible to the people; the administration of the sacrament in both\r\nkinds; reform of the clergy after the pattern of the Apostles; and\r\npunishment for \"mortal sins\" in proportion to their enormity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: His full name was George Hruby Gelenshky.

Lot. Germ. Hung._ Buda\r\n1825.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE POLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe regions of the Baltic and Lower Vistula, after the Goths and\r\nVandals had finally left them, were occupied, towards the fourth\r\ncentury, by the Lettonians and Lithuanians, who are according to some\r\nhistorians Slavic, and according to others Finnic-Scythic tribes.[1]\r\nIt appears, that the various nations which inhabited this country were\r\nby the ancients comprised under the name of Sarmatae. In the sixth, or\r\naccording to others, in the seventh century, the Lekhes, a people\r\nkindred to the Czekhes, and coming like them from the Carpathian\r\nregions, whence they were urged forwards by the Bulgarians, settled on\r\nthe banks of the Vistula and Varta. Lekh (Ljakh) signified in old\r\nBohemian a free and noble man, and had this meaning still in the\r\nfourteenth century.[2] The Lekhes were divided into several tribes, of\r\nwhich, according to Nestor, at first only those who settled on the\r\nvast plains, _polie_, of the Ukraine, were called _Polyane_, Poles,\r\ni.e. inhabitants of the plain. The tribes which occupied Masovia were\r\ncalled _Masovshane_; the Lekhes who went to Pomerania, _Pomoriane_,\r\netc. The specific name of _Poles_, as applied to all the Lekhish\r\ntribes together, does not appear until the close of the tenth century,\r\nwhen the generic appellation of Lekhes or Ljakhes had perished. In the\r\nyear 840, the chiefs of the different tribes united themselves under\r\none common head; at that time they are said to have chosen a\r\nhusbandman by the name of Pjast for their duke, and the male\r\ndescendants of this, their first prince, lived and reigned not less\r\nthan six hundred and thirty years. From Germany and Bohemia\r\nChristianity was carried to Poland by Romish priests, probably as\r\nearly as the ninth century. In the beginning of the tenth, some\r\nattempts were made to introduce the Slavic liturgy into Poland. Both\r\nspecies of worship existed for some time peacefully side by side; and\r\neven when, through the exertions of the Latin priesthood, the Slavic\r\nliturgy was gradually superseded by the occidental rites, the former\r\nwas at least tolerated; and after the invention of printing, the\r\nPolish city of Cracow was the first place where books in the Old\r\nSlavic dialect, and portions of the Old Slavic Bible, were printed.[3]\r\n\r\nIn the year 965, the duke Miecislav married the Bohemian princess\r\nDombrovka, and caused himself to be baptized. From that time onward,\r\nall the Polish princes and the greatest part of the nation became\r\nChristians. There is however not one among the Slavic nations, in\r\nwhich the influence Christianity must necessarily have exerted on its\r\nmental cultivation, is so little visible; while upon its language it\r\nexerted none at all. It has ever been and is still a favourite opinion\r\nof some Slavic philologists, that several of the Slavic nations must\r\nhave possessed the art of writing long before their acquaintance with\r\nthe Latin alphabet, or the invention of the Cyrillic system; and among\r\nthe arguments by which they maintain this view, there are indeed some\r\ntoo striking to be wholly set aside. But neither from those early\r\ntimes, nor from the four or five centuries after the introduction of\r\nChristianity, does there remain any monument whatever of the Polish\r\nlanguage; nay, with the exception of a few fragments without value,\r\nthe most ancient document of that language extant is not older than\r\nthe sixteenth century. Until that time the Latin idiom reigned\r\nexclusively in Poland. The teachers of Christianity in this country\r\nwere for nearly five centuries foreigners, viz. Germans and Italians.\r\nHence arose that unnatural neglect of the vernacular tongue, of which\r\nthese were ignorant; the private influence of the German, still\r\nvisible in the Polish language; and the unlimited dominion of the\r\nLatin. Slavic, Polish, and heathenish, were to them synonymous words.\r\nThus, while the light of Christianity everywhere carried the first\r\ndawn of life into the night of Slavic antiquity, the early history of\r\nPoland affords more than any other part of the Christian world a\r\nmelancholy proof, how the passions and blindness of men operated to\r\ncounterbalance that holy influence. But although so unfavourably\r\ndisposed towards the language, it cannot be said that the influence of\r\nthe foreign clergy was in other respects injurious to the literary\r\ncultivation of the country. Benedictine monks founded in the beginning\r\nof the eleventh century the first Polish schools; and numerous\r\nconvents of their own and other orders presented to the scholar an\r\nasylum, both when in the year 1241 the Mongols broke into the country,\r\nand also during the civil wars which were caused by the family\r\ndissensions of Pjast's successors. Several chronicles in Latin were\r\nwritten by Poles long before the history of the Polish literature\r\nbegins; and Polish noblemen went to Paris, Bologna, and Prague, to\r\nstudy sciences, for the very elements of which their own language\r\nafforded them no means.\r\n\r\nPolish writers are in the habit of dividing the history of their\r\nlanguage into five periods.[4]\r\n\r\nThe _first_ period extends from the introduction of Christianity to\r\nCassimir the Great, A.D. 1333.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ period extends from A.D. 1333 to A.D. 1506, or the reign\r\nof Sigismund I.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ period is the golden age of the Polish literature, and\r\ncloses with the foundation of the schools of the Jesuits, A.D. 1622.\r\n\r\nThe _fourth_ period comprises the time of the preponderance of the\r\nJesuits, and ends with the revival of literature by Konarski, A.D.\r\n1760.\r\n\r\nThe _fifth_ period comprehends the interval from A.D. 1760 to the\r\nrevolution in 1830.\r\n\r\nAs the Polish literature of our own day bears a different stamp from\r\nthat of former times, we may add a _sixth_ period, extending from 1830\r\nto the present time.\r\n\r\nBefore we enter upon a regular historical account of these different\r\nperiods, we will devote a few words to the history and character of\r\nthe language itself.\r\n\r\nThe extent of country, in which the Polish language is predominant, is\r\nmuch smaller than would naturally be concluded from the great\r\ncircuit of territory, which, at the time of its power and\r\nindependence, was comprised under the kingdom of Poland. We do not\r\nallude to the sixteenth century, when Poland by the success of its\r\narms became for a short time the most powerful state in the north;\r\nwhen the Teutonic knights, the conquerors of Prussia, were compelled\r\nto acknowledge its protection; and when not only were Livonia and\r\nCourland, the one a component part of the Polish kingdom, and the\r\nother a Polish fief, but even the ancient Smolensk and the venerable\r\nKief, the royal seat of Vladimir, and the Russian provinces adjacent\r\nto Galicia, all were subjugated by Poland. We speak of this kingdom as\r\nit was at the time of its first partition between Russia, Austria, and\r\nPrussia. Of the four or five millions of inhabitants in the provinces\r\nunited with Russia at the three successive partitions of 1772, 1793,\r\nand 1795, only one and a half million are strictly Poles, that is,\r\nLekhes, who speak dialects of that language;[5] in White and Black\r\nRussia, the Russniaks are by far more numerous; and in Lithuania the\r\nLithuanians. Besides the independent language of these latter, the\r\nMalo-Russian and White Russian dialects are spoken in these provinces;\r\nand all documents of the grand-duchy of Lithuania before it was united\r\nwith Poland in A.D. 1569, were written in the latter.[8]\r\n\r\nThe Polish language is farther spoken: 1) By the inhabitants of the\r\nkingdom of Poland formed in 1815, three and a half millions in number,\r\nor reckoned together with the Poles of the Polish-Russian provinces,\r\nfive millions; 2) By the inhabitants of the cities and the nobility of\r\nGalicia, belonging to Austria, and the Poles in the Austrian part of\r\nSilesia, about three millions; 3) By the inhabitants of the small\r\nrepublic of Cracow, about one hundred thousand; 4) By the inhabitants\r\nof the Prussian grand-duchy of Posen, and a part of the province\r\ncalled Western Prussia, together with the Poles in Silesia and the\r\nKassubes in Pomerania; In all less than two millions.[7]\r\n\r\nThus the Polish language is spoken by a population of about ten\r\nmillions.[8] Like all living languages, it has different dialects, and\r\nis in one place spoken with greater purity than in another. As these\r\nvarieties, however, are neither very striking nor have ever had an\r\ninfluence on literature, they do not concern us here.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Polish language seems to have been very nearly related to\r\nthe dialects of the Czekhes and the Sorabian Vendes. Although very\r\nlittle is known in respect to the circumstances and progress of the\r\nformation of the language into its present state, it is sufficiently\r\nobvious, that it has been developed from the conflict of its natural\r\nelements with the Latin and German idioms. Of the other Slavic\r\ndialects, the Bohemian is the only one which has exerted any influence\r\nupon the Polish tongue. The Italian and Turkish words introduced\r\nduring the dominion of an Italian priesthood, and through the\r\npolitical relations of the Poles and the Turks, never entered deeply\r\ninto the body of the language; and might be easily exchanged for\r\nbetter Polish forms of expression.\r\n\r\nOf all the Slavic dialects, the Polish presents to the foreigner the\r\nmost difficulties; partly on account of the great variety and nicety\r\nof shades in the pronunciation of the vowels, and from the combination\r\nof consonants in such a way that only a Slavic tongue can conquer\r\nthem, and cause the apparent harshness in some measure to\r\ndisappear;[9] partly on account of its refined and artificial\r\ngrammatical structure. In this latter respect it differs materially\r\nfrom the Russian language; which, although equally rich, is remarkable\r\nfor its simplicity and perspicuity. The Polish and Bohemian idioms, in\r\nthe opinion of the best judges, are above all others capable of\r\nfaithfully imitating the refinements of the classical languages; and\r\nthe Polish prose is modelled after the Latin with a perfection, which,\r\nin the golden age of Polish literature, was one of its characteristic\r\nfeatures. It is therefore surprising, that the Polish language in\r\npoetry, although in other respects highly cultivated, does not admit\r\nthe introduction of the classical prosody. We mean, the Polish\r\nlanguage in its present state; for it is very probable, that in its\r\noriginal character it possessed, in common with all the other Slavic\r\nlanguages, the elements of a regular system of _long_ and _short_\r\nsyllables. So long, however, as there have existed Polish poets, they\r\nhave not measured, but, in imitation of the French, have _counted_ the\r\nsyllables. With the exception of a few recent poets, who have written\r\nin blank verse, and a few weak attempts to adapt the Greek principles\r\nof accent to the Polish language, all Polish poetry is, like the\r\nFrench, in rhyme; and the French Alexandrine is the favourite form of\r\nthe Polish poets.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From the introduction of Christianity to Casimir the Great, A.D.\r\n1333._\r\n\r\nIn dividing the early part of the history of the Polish literature\r\ninto two periods, we follow the example and authority of Bentkowski;\r\nalthough it seems to be singular to pretend to give an account of a\r\nliterature which did not yet exist. The history of the Polish\r\nliterature does not indeed properly begin before the close of the\r\nsecond period; yet that of the _literary cultivation_ of the nation\r\ncommences with the beginning of that period; and a few slight traces\r\nof it are to be found even in the middle of the first. Of the language\r\nitself, nothing is left but the names of places and persons, and some\r\nPolish words scattered through the Latin documents of the time,\r\nwritten without orthographic rules, and therefore often hardly\r\nintelligible. There exists an ancient Polish war-song, the author of\r\nwhich is said to have been St. Adalbert, a Bohemian by birth, who was\r\nbishop of Prague at the end of the tenth century;[11] but even\r\naccording to Rakowiecki, a philologist who is more disposed than any\r\nother to find traces of an _early_ cultivation of the Slavic nations,\r\nand especially of the Poles, this song, or rather hymn, is, in its\r\npresent form, not older than the fourteenth century. All that is\r\nextant from this period is written in Latin. Besides some unimportant\r\ndocuments and an anonymous biography of Adalbert, there remain several\r\nhistorical works of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nMartin Gallus, a Frenchman, who lived in Poland between 1110 and 1135,\r\nis considered as the oldest Polish historian. Other chronicles of\r\nPoland were written by the bishops of Cracow, Matthew Cholewa, and\r\nVincent, son of Kadlubec, who died in 1223; by Bogufal, bishop of\r\nPosen, some twenty years later; and by Godzislav Baszko, about thirty\r\nyears later still. Strzembski wrote towards the middle of the\r\nthirteenth century a history of the popes and Roman emperors. In 1008\r\nduke Boleslav, the son of Miecislav, invited Benedictine monks to\r\nPoland, who founded convents at Sieciechov and Lysagora, with schools\r\nattached to them. This example was followed at a later period by other\r\norders: and in Poland, longer than in any other country, education was\r\nentirely in the hands of the ecclesiastics. For several hundred years\r\nthe natives were excluded from all clerical dignities and privileges,\r\nand the numerous monasteries were filled only with foreign monks. Even\r\nas late as the fifteenth century, foreigners had decidedly the\r\npreference. In the year 1237 Pelka, archbishop of Gnesen, directed the\r\ninstitution of schools by the priests; but added the recommendation\r\nto the bishops, that they should employ as teachers only Germans who\r\nunderstood Polish. In A.D. 1285 at the synod of Leczyc, they went a\r\nstep further in excluding all foreigners, who were ignorant of the\r\nPolish language, from the places of ecclesiastical teachers and\r\ninstructors. But more than eighty years later, it was found necessary\r\nat the synod of Kalish in 1357 to repeat the same decree; and even a\r\ncentury after this time, in A.D. 1460, John Ostrorog complained that\r\nall the rich convents were occupied by foreign monks.[12] These\r\nignorant men were wont to throw into the fire the few writings in the\r\nbarbarian language, which they could discover; and, as instructors of\r\nthe youth, were able to fill the heads of the young nobility with the\r\nmost unnatural prejudices against the vernacular tongue of their own\r\ncountry. Besides the clergy, many other foreigners also settled in\r\nPoland, as mechanics and traders, especially Germans. But as they all\r\nlived merely in the cities of Poland, they and their language had far\r\nless influence on the people, than was the case in Bohemia, where they\r\nmingled with all classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From Casimir the Great to Sigismund I. A.D. 1333 to A.D. 1506._\r\n\r\nCasimir is one of the few princes, who acquired the name of the Great\r\nnot by victories and conquests, but through the real benefits of laws,\r\nnational courts of justice, and means of education, which he procured\r\nfor his subjects. His father, Vladislaus Lokietek, had resumed the\r\nroyal title, which hitherto had been alternately taken and dropped;\r\nand was the first who permanently united Great and Little Poland.\r\nUnder Casimir, the present Austrian kingdom of Galicia, which,\r\ntogether with Lodomeria, the present Russian government Vladimir, was\r\nthen called Red Russia, was added by inheritance. Lithuania became\r\nconnected with Poland as a Polish fief in the year 1386. when queen\r\nHedevig, heiress of the crown of Poland, married Jagello, duke of\r\nLithuania; but was first completely incorporated as a component part\r\nof the kingdom of Poland only so late as the year 1569. Masovia had\r\nbeen thus united some forty years earlier. At the time of the marriage\r\nof Hedevig and Jagello, the latter caused himself to be baptized, and\r\nintroduced Christianity into Lithuania, where he himself in many cases\r\nacted as an apostle.\r\n\r\nAs to the influence of Casimir the Great upon the literary cultivation\r\nof his subjects, it was more mediate than immediate. Whilst his\r\ncotemporary and neighbour, Charles IV of Bohemia, loved and patronized\r\nthe language of that kindred nation. Casimir paid no attention\r\nwhatever to the vernacular tongue of his country; nor was any thing\r\ndone under his administration for the development of that rich\r\ndialect. This king indeed, as early as A.D. 1347, laid the foundation\r\nof the high school of Cracow; but the regular organization and\r\ninfluence of this institution dates only from half a century\r\nlater.[13] But by introducing a better order of things, by providing\r\nhis subjects with their earliest code of laws, by instituting the\r\nfirst constitutional diets, by fortifying the cities and protecting\r\nthe tillers of the soil against a wild and oppressive nobility, he\r\nestablished a better tone of moral feeling throughout the nation. A\r\nseed, sown in such ground, necessarily springs up slowly, but surely.\r\n\r\nWith Casimir the race of the Pjasts expired. His nephew, Louis of\r\nHungary, a prince of the house of Anjou, was elected king; but his\r\nreign was spent in constant war, and left no trace of care for the\r\ninternal cultivation of the country. The limitation of the power of\r\nthe sovereign, and the exorbitant privileges of the Polish nobility,\r\ndate from the reign of this prince; he resided mostly in Hungary, and\r\ngranted to the Poles all their demands, in order to prevent the\r\nalienation of their crown from his house. After his death his second\r\ndaughter, Hedevig, was preferred to the emperor Sigismund, who was\r\nmarried to the eldest, Mary; because this prince refused to subscribe\r\nthe conditions demanded by the Polish Estates. Hedevig married Jagello\r\nof Lithuania; and under their descendants the Jagellons, who reigned\r\nnearly two centuries, Poland rose to the summit of its power and\r\nglory. With Siegmund I, the grandson of Jagello, but the fifth king\r\nafter him, a new period of the Polish literature begins.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Polish language, as we have already said, properly\r\ncommences only with the close, or at the utmost with the middle of the\r\npresent period, when in the year 1488 the first printing office was\r\nerected at Cracow. Of the more ancient times, with a few exceptions,\r\nonly weak and scattered traces are left. There was said to have\r\nexisted a Polish translation of the Bible, made by order of queen\r\nHedevig before the year 1390; but no copy had ever been seen; and\r\nthere was reason to doubt whether it ever existed. There was extant\r\nhowever, an old manuscript of a Psalter, which the antiquarian Thadd.\r\nCzacki took to be a fragment of it; and other ancient manuscripts of\r\nportions of a Psalter were found at Saros Patak in Hungary, and seemed\r\nto belong to it. But no one of these codices bore any incontestable\r\nmark of its age. The Psalter of St. Florian, a convent near Linz in\r\nAustria, discovered in 1826 by the librarian Chmel, proved at last to\r\nbe in reality the lost treasure. This important document, the origin\r\nof which could be philologically and historically traced back to the\r\nfourteenth century, after having given occasion to a passionate\r\nconflict in the Slavic literary world, was finally published by\r\nKopitar in a complete and erudite edition, as the most ancient\r\nmonument of the Polish language.[14]\r\n\r\nAll other Polish manuscripts of those times are fragments; documents\r\nrelating to suits of law, translations of statutes issued in Latin,\r\nthe ten commandments in verse, a translation of one of Wickliffe's\r\nhymns, etc.\r\n\r\nThe orthography of the language, and especially the adoption of the\r\nLatin alphabet, seems to have troubled the few writers of this period\r\nexceedingly. They appear to have founded their principles alternately\r\non the Latin, the Bohemian, and the German methods of combining\r\nletters; an inconsistency, which adds greatly to the difficulties of\r\nmodern Slavic etymology.[15] In 1828 a remarkable manuscript was\r\npublished under the title, _Pamientniki Janozara_, or Memoirs of a\r\nJanissary. It was the journal of a Polish nobleman, who had been\r\ninduced by circumstances to enter the Turkish army during the siege\r\nand conquest of Constantinople, an event which took place A.D. 1453.\r\nThis interesting document of a language, that is so remarkably poor in\r\nancient monuments, was no longer intelligible to the common Polish\r\nreader. It was necessary to add a version in modern Polish in order to\r\nmake it understood.\r\n\r\nAnnalists of Polish history, who wrote in Latin, were not wanting in\r\nthis period. Sig. Rositzius, Dzierzva,[16] and more especially John\r\nDlugosz, bishop of Lemberg, wrote histories and chronicles of\r\nPoland; and the work of the latter is still considered as highly\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From Sigismund I, to the establishment of the schools of the Jesuits\r\nin Cracow. A.D._. 1505 _to A.D_. 1622.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn northern climates, the bright and glowing days of summer follow in\r\nalmost immediate succession a long and gloomy winter, without allowing\r\nto the attentive mind of the lover of nature the enjoyment of\r\nobserving, during a transient interval of spring, the gradual\r\ndevelopment of the beauty of the earth. Thus the flowers of Polish\r\nliterature burst out from their buds with a rapidity unequalled in\r\nliterary history, and were ripened into fruit with the same prodigious\r\ncelerity.\r\n\r\nThe university of Cracow had been reinstituted under Jagello in A.D.\r\n1400, and organized after the model of that of Prague. Although the\r\nmost flourishing period of this institution was the sixteenth century,\r\nyet it presented during the fifteenth to the Polish nobility a good\r\nopportunity of studying the classics; and it is doubtless through this\r\npreparatory familiarity with the ancient writers, that the phenomenon\r\nto which we have alluded must be principally accounted for. It was\r\nmoreover now the epoch, when the genius of Christian Europe made the\r\nmost decided efforts to shake off the chains which had fettered the\r\nfreedom of thought. The doctrines of the German Reformers, although\r\nthe number of their professed disciples was in proportion smaller than\r\nin Bohemia, had nevertheless a decided influence upon the general\r\ndirection of the public mind. The wild flame of false religious zeal,\r\nwhich in Poland also under the sons and immediate successors of\r\nJagello, had kindled the faggots in which the disciples of the new\r\ndoctrines were called to seal the truth of their conviction with their\r\nblood, was extinguished before the milder wisdom of Sigismund I;\r\nalthough the early part of his reign was not free from religious\r\npersecution. The activity of the inquisition was restrained. But the\r\nnew doctrines found a more decided support in Sigismund Augustus.\r\nPoland became, under his administration, the seat of a toleration then\r\nunequalled in the world. Communities of the most different religious\r\nprinciples formed themselves, at first under the indulgence of the\r\nking and the government, and finally under the protection of the law.\r\nEven the boldest theological skeptics of the age, the two Socini,\r\nfound in Poland an asylum.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian language, which already possessed so extensive a\r\nliterature, acquired during this period a great influence upon the\r\nPolish. The number of clerical writers, however, which in Bohemia was\r\nso great, was comparatively only small in Poland. Indeed it is worthy\r\nof remark, that while in other countries the diffusion of information\r\nand general illumination proceeded from the clergy, not indeed as a\r\nbody, but from individuals among the clergy, in Poland it was always\r\nthe highest nobility who were at the head of literary enterprises or\r\ninstitutions for mental cultivation. There are many princely names\r\namong the writers of this period; and there are still so among those\r\nof the present day. This may however be one of the causes, why\r\neducation in Poland was entirely confined to the higher classes;\r\nwhile, even during this brilliant period, the peasantry remained in\r\nthe lowest state of degradation, and _nothing_ was done to elevate\r\ntheir minds or to better their condition. For it is to the clergy,\r\nthat the common people have always to look as their natural and\r\nbounden teachers; it is to the clergy, that a low state of cultivation\r\namong the poorer classes is the most dishonourable. During this\r\nperiod, however, the opportunity was presented to the people of\r\nbecoming better acquainted with the Scriptures, through several\r\ntranslations of them into the Polish language, not only by the\r\ndifferent Protestant denominations, but also by the Romanists\r\nthemselves. Indeed, with the exceptions above mentioned, all the\r\ntranslations of the Bible extant in the Polish language are from the\r\nsixteenth or the beginning of the seventeenth century.[18]\r\n\r\nWe meet also, among the productions of the literature of this period,\r\na few catechisms and postillac, written expressly for the instruction\r\nof the common people by some eminent Lutheran and reformed Polish\r\nministers. But the want of means for acquiring even the most\r\nelementary information, was so great, that only a very few among the\r\nlower classes were able to read them. The doctrines of the Reformers,\r\nwhich every where else were favoured principally by the middle and\r\nlower classes, in Poland found their chief support among the nobility.\r\nComparatively few of the people adhered to them. There was a time,\r\nbetween 1550 and 1650, when half the senate,[19] and even more than\r\nhalf of the nobility, consisted of Lutherans and Calvinists. In the\r\nyear 1570, these two denominations, together with the Bohemian\r\nBrethren, formed a union of their churches by the treaty of Sendomir\r\nfor external or political purposes. In 1573, by another treaty known\r\nunder the name of _pax dissidentium_, they were acknowledged by the\r\nstate and the king, and all the rights of the Catholics were granted\r\nto the members of these three denominations, and also to the Greeks\r\nand Armenians. The want, however, of an accurate determination of\r\ntheir mutual relation to each other, occasioned repeatedly in the\r\ncourse of the following century bloody dissensions. The Protestants\r\nsucceeded, nevertheless, in maintaining their rights, until the years\r\n1717 and 1718, when their number having gradually yet considerably\r\ndiminished, they were deprived of their suffrages in the diet. Their\r\nadversaries went still further; and, after struggling against\r\noppression of all sorts, the dissidents had at length, in 1736, to be\r\ncontented with being acknowledged as _tolerated sects_. After the\r\naccession of Stanislaus Poniatowsky to the throne in 1766, the\r\ndissidents attempted to regain their former rights. In this they were\r\nsupported by several Protestant powers; but more especially by Russia,\r\nwho thus improved the opportunity of increasing its influence in\r\nPolish affairs. In consequence of this powerful support, the laws\r\ndirected against the dissidents were repealed; and in 1775 all their\r\nold privileges were restored to them, except the right of being\r\neligible to the stations of ministers of state and senators. In more\r\nrecent times the Protestants have been admitted to all the rights of\r\nthe Catholics; although the Roman Catholic is still the predominant\r\nreligion of the kingdom of Poland.\r\n\r\nWe have permitted ourselves this digression, and anticipation of time;\r\nalthough we shall have an opportunity of again returning to this\r\nsubject. The influence of Protestantism on the literature of Poland\r\ncannot be denied; although its doctrines and their immediate\r\nconsequence, the private examination and interpretation of the\r\nScriptures, have occupied the minds and pens of the Poles less than\r\nthose of any other nation among whom they have been received. We now\r\nreturn to the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Polish language acquired during this period such a degree of\r\nrefinement, that even on the revival of literature and taste in\r\nmodern times, it was necessary to add nothing for its improvement;\r\nalthough the course of time naturally had occasioned some changes.\r\nSeveral able men occupied themselves with its systematic culture by\r\nmeans of grammars and dictionaries. Zaborowski, Statorius, and\r\nJanuscowski wrote grammars; Macynski compiled the first dictionary.\r\nThe first part of Knapski's _Thesaurus_, an esteemed work even at the\r\npresent day, was first published in 1621, and may therefore be\r\nconsidered as a production of this period. But the practical use,\r\nwhich so many gifted writers made of the language for a variety of\r\nsubjects, contributed still more to its cultivation. The point in\r\nwhich it acquired less perfection, and which appeared the most\r\ndifficult to subject to fixed rules, was that of orthography. That\r\nthe Latin alphabet is not fully adapted to express Slavic sounds, is\r\nevident in the Polish language. Indeed the reputed harshness of this\r\nlanguage rests partly on the manner in which they were obliged to\r\ncombine several consonants, which to the eye of the occidental\r\nEuropean can only be united by intermediate vowels. On the other\r\nhand, it is just this system of letters which forms a connecting link\r\nbetween the Polish language and those of western Europe; and although\r\nmost Slavic philologists regret that the Latin alphabet ever should\r\nhave been adopted for any Slavic language in preference to the\r\nCyrillic, yet Grimm (with whom we fully agree) thinks that \"the\r\nadoption of the former, with appropriate additions corresponding to\r\nthe peculiar sounds of each language and dialect, would have been\r\nbeneficial to all European languages.\"[20]\r\n\r\nAlthough the art of printing was introduced into Poland as early as\r\n1488, when the first printing office was established at Cracow, yet\r\nprinted books first became generally diffused between the years 1530\r\nand 1540. The first work printed in Poland was a calendar for the year\r\n1490; the first book printed in the Polish language was Bonaventura's\r\nlife of Jesus, translated for the queen of Hungary, and published in\r\n1522. In the second half of the sixteenth century nearly every city,\r\nwhich had a considerable school, had also its printing office.[21] The\r\nschools were unfortunately confined to the cities; nothing was done\r\nfor the peasantry, who have remained even to the most recent times in\r\na state of physical and moral degradation, with which that of the\r\ncommon people of no other country except Russia can be compared. A\r\npeasant who could read or write, would have been considered as a\r\nprodigy. So much the more, however, was done for the national\r\neducation of the nobility. In the year 1579 the university of Wilna\r\nwas instituted; in 1594, another university was created at Zamosc in\r\nLittle Poland, by a private nobleman, the great chancellor Zamoyski;\r\nwhich however survived only a few years, and perished in the beginning\r\nof the seventeenth century.[22] Numerous other schools of a less\r\nelevated character were founded at Thorn, Dantzic, Lissa, etc. most of\r\nthem for Protestants.\r\n\r\nSo early as under Casimir, the son of Jagello, the Polish language\r\nbegan to be employed as the language of the court. Under his grandson\r\nSigismund Augustus, the public laws and decrees were promulgated in\r\nthe vernacular tongue of the country. But a language which thus issued\r\nfrom the court, was necessarily also dependent on the changes of the\r\ncourt. The influence of the French prince, Henry of Valois, successor\r\nof Sigismund Augustus, could not be considerable, as he occupied the\r\nthrone only two months. But Stephen Bathory, prince of Transylvania,\r\nthe brother-in-law of Sigismund Augustus, who was elected after Henry\r\nof Valois had deserted the country, was as a foreigner in the habit of\r\ninterspersing his conversation and writings with Latin words, when the\r\nproper Polish words, of which language he had only an imperfect\r\nknowledge, did not occur to him. It is hardly credible that such a\r\nhabit, or rather the imitation of it among his courtiers, could have\r\nhad any influence on a language already so well established and\r\ncultivated, as the Polish idiom was at the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. The Polish literary historians, however, ascribe to Bathory's\r\ninfluence the fashion, which began at this time to prevail, of\r\ndebasing the purity of the Polish language by an intermixture of Latin\r\nwords and phrases.[23]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Polish literature acquired during this period a kind of\r\nuniversality, and there were few departments of science, familiar to\r\nthat age, which were not to some extent cultivated in it, yet it owes\r\nits principal lustre to the contributions made in it to history,\r\npoetry and rhetoric. The didactic style did not reach the perfection\r\nof the historical; nor did Polish literature acquire any wide domain\r\nin purely scientific productions. In accordance with the national\r\ntendency, the mass of distinguished talents was devoted to those\r\ninterests, which yield an immediate profit in life, or which are\r\nthemselves rather the results of empirical knowledge, than of abstract\r\ncontemplation, viz. to politics, to eloquence, and to poetry, in so\r\nfar as this latter is considered not as a creative power, but as the\r\nmost appropriate means for expressing and describing the emotions,\r\npassions, and actions of man. There have however always been not a few\r\ngifted Poles, who have cultivated the field of science for its own\r\nsake, without reference to the practical importance of their labours;\r\nand there are more especially at the present time many distinguished\r\nnames among the Polish mathematicians, natural philosophers, and\r\nchemists. In Copernicus himself, born indeed of parents of German\r\nextraction, and in a city (Thorn) mostly inhabited by German\r\ncolonists, but also born a Polish subject and educated in a Polish\r\nuniversity, Poland and Germany seem to have equal rights.[24]\r\n\r\nThe principal reason why didactic prose did not acquire the same\r\ndegree of cultivation as the historical style, is, that all\r\nscientific works during this period, which was that of the formation\r\nof the language, were written by preference in Latin. Indeed, the\r\nauthority of the classical languages did not suffer at all from the\r\nrising of the national literature. It is on the contrary a remarkable\r\nfact, that the cultivation of the vernacular tongue of the country,\r\nand the study of the Latin language in Poland, have ever proceeded\r\nwith equal steps. The most eminent writers and orators of this period,\r\nwho employed the Polish language, managed also the Latin with the\r\ngreatest skill and dexterity. Even for common conversation, Latin and\r\nPolish were used alternately. Sigismund I, when separated from his\r\nfirst queen, Barbara Zapolska, maintained with her a correspondence in\r\nLatin; his second queen, Bona Sforza, used to employ that language in\r\ntheir most familiar intercourse.[25] Choisnin, in his Memoirs of the\r\nelection of Henry of Valois, observes, that among a hundred Polish\r\nnoblemen, there were hardly to be found two, who did not understand\r\nLatin, German, and Italian; and Martin Kromer goes so far as to state,\r\nthat perhaps in Latium itself fewer persons had spoken Latin fluently\r\nthan in Poland.[26] The reputation of the Latin poet Casimir\r\nSarbiewski, in Latin Sarbievus, spread through all Europe. Most Polish\r\npoets were equally successful both in Polish and Latin verse. As the\r\nformer language first developed itself in poetry, we therefore, in our\r\nenumeration of the principal writers of this time, begin with the\r\npoets.\r\n\r\nHere the influence of the classics, and, above all, that of the\r\nItalian literature, is very distinctly perceived. Rey of Naglowic, ob.\r\n1569, is called the father of Polish poetry. Most of his productions\r\nare of the religious kind, chiefly in verse, but also orations and\r\npostillæ. His chief work was a translation of the Psalms.[27]\r\n\r\nHis principal followers were the Kochanowskis, a name of threefold\r\nlustre. John Kochanowski, ob. 1584, by far the most distinguished of\r\nthem, published likewise a translation of David's Psalms, which is\r\nstill considered as a classical work; in his other poems, Pindar,\r\nAnacreon, and Horace, were alternately his models, without diminishing\r\nthe original value of his pieces.[28] Adam Mickiewicz compares him, in\r\nrespect to the brevity, conciseness, and terseness of his expression,\r\nwith the last named Roman poet; in reference to his treatment of the\r\nclassic elements, to Goethe. His brother Andrew translated Virgil's\r\nÆneid; his nephew Peter, with more talent and success, the great epics\r\nof Tasso and Ariosto.\r\n\r\nRybinski maintains, as a lyric poet, in the opinion of several\r\ncritics, the same rank with John Kochanowski; like him he wrote Polish\r\nand Latin verses, and was created poet laureate. Simon Szymonowicz,\r\ncalled Simonides, ob. 1629, obtained likewise the poetical crown from\r\nthe pope Clement VIII; indeed his Latin odes secured him a lasting\r\nfame throughout all Europe, and procured him the appellation of the\r\nLatin Pindar. In Polish he wrote mostly idylls, after the model of\r\nTheocritus, Bion, and Moschus; but these, as their chief merit\r\nconsists in the sweetness and delicacy of the language, only natives\r\nare able fully to appreciate.[29] The productions of his friend and\r\ncontemporary Zimorowicz have the same general character, but are of\r\nless value in respect to diction. Other lyrical poets of merit may be\r\nnamed; e.g. the archbishop of Lemberg, Grochowski, a very productive\r\nwriter; Czahrowski, Klonowicz, called also Acernus, and others.[30] As\r\npoets of a religious character we name here together, without\r\nreference to the denomination to which they belonged,--since most of\r\nthe Polish poetical productions of this age were of a higher character\r\nthan to suffer the intrusion of polemics,--Dambrowski, Bartoszewski,\r\nMiaskowski, whoso hymns are considered as the finest of that period,\r\nSudrovius, Turnowski, and others. The age was also rich in satires and\r\nepigrams, Polish as well as Latin. Productions of this class by the\r\ntwo Zbylitowskis, Pudlowski, Kraiewski, and a great many others, are\r\nstill extant.\r\n\r\nThe facility of rhyme in a language so rich in rhymes as the Polish,\r\nseduced several writers to use verse as a vehicle for the most trivial\r\nthoughts, or for subjects the very nature of which is opposed to\r\npoetry. Thus Paprocki of Glogol, who is esteemed as a diligent\r\nhistorian and accurate investigator of the past, wrote his numerous\r\nworks on genealogy and heraldry mostly in rhyme.[31] Other historical\r\npoems were also written, which perhaps would not have been utterly\r\ndeficient in merit, had they been transferred into prose.\r\n\r\nEloquence, so nearly related to poetry, and which, nevertheless,\r\nperhaps on that very account, should be distinguished from it by the\r\nmost definite limits, is a gift, the cultivation of which may be\r\nexpected above all in a republic. The Poles possess indeed all the\r\nnecessary qualities for public orators; and eminent talents not only\r\nfor poetical eloquence, but also for the pulpit, are not uncommon\r\namong them. Gornicki, ob. after 1591, Czarnkowski, Odachowski, and\r\nothers, but especially the first named, were considered as the most\r\ndistinguished orators of the age. The eloquence of the pulpit was\r\nexhibited in its highest eminence by Peter Skarga, court preacher of\r\nSigismund III, whom his cotemporaries used to call the Polish\r\nChrysostom; and by the learned Jesuit Wuiek, who also translated the\r\nBible into Polish.[32] The sermons and orations of both of them,\r\nbesides numerous other theological productions, were published at the\r\ntime. Other theological writers of some distinction were, among the\r\nCatholics, Stanislaus Karnkowski, archbishop of Gnesen, Bierkowski,\r\nwho was Skarga's successor, Bialobrzeski, Kuczborski, the Jesuit\r\nRosciszewski, and others; among the Protestants, Seklucyan, the\r\ntranslator of the Polish Bible for Protestants;[33] Koszutski of\r\nZarnowec, Radomski, Gilowski, and Budny, one of the leaders of the\r\nUnitarians, who also translated the Bible into Polish from the\r\noriginal languages.[34] We must remark, that the Polish theological\r\nliterature of this period evinced much less of a polemical spirit than\r\nmight have been expected, in an age when that of the neighbouring\r\ncountries, Bohemia and Germany, abounded in controversial books and\r\npamphlets, replete with unchristian bitterness and doctrinal rigidity.\r\nFor productions of this character we have to look in Poland to the\r\nfollowing period. The wise moderation of the two Sigismunds, and of\r\nStephen Bathory, seems to have had a prodigious influence on the minds\r\nof the nation, to pacify them and keep them within appropriate limits.\r\n\r\nHistory, especially national history, was justly considered as one of\r\nthe subjects most worthy of human attention. History is the great\r\nschool, in which nations appear as the pupils, experience as the\r\nteacher; and the fate of mankind depends on a wise application of the\r\ngreat moral lessons which they daily receive. Most of the Polish\r\nhistorians of this ago preferred however the Latin language; but their\r\nproductions are too intimately connected with Poland to be separated\r\nfrom its literature, and may, therefore, be named here. The Polish\r\nchronicle written by Matthew of Miechow, body physician to Sigismund\r\nI, and published in 1521, was the first historical work printed in\r\nPoland. Martin Kromer, bishop of Ermeland or Warmia, called the Livy\r\nof Poland, Wapowski, Guagnini, an Italian, but naturalized and\r\nennobled in Poland, and Piasecki, a Protestant, distinguished for his\r\nfrankness, wrote works on Polish history; Koialowicz, on that of\r\nLithuania. They all wrote in Latin. The first who published an\r\nhistorical work in Polish was Martin Bielski, ob. 1576. His chronicle\r\nof Poland, which is of value in every respect, is written in a style\r\nso beautiful, that it was called _le style d'or_. His son Joachim\r\ncontinued this work as far as to the reign of Sigismund III.[35]\r\nAnother Polish chronicle, compiled with more erudition than taste, was\r\nwritten by Stryikowski, the author of numerous works on various\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nOther writers of merit, some of whom published original works on\r\nportions of history, while some translated the Latin volumes of their\r\ncountrymen, or those of classic historical authors, were Wargocki, the\r\nPolish translator of Julius Cæsar, and other Roman writers;\r\nOrzechowski, also lauded as an orator; Januszowski, Blazowski,\r\nPaszkowski, Cyprian Bazylik, and others. Works on tactics were\r\npublished by John Tarnowski, a general celebrated in his time; by\r\nStrubicz, and Cielecki. Collections of statutes and laws were made by\r\nHerbart, Sapieha, Groicki, Sarnicki, and others.\r\n\r\nSeveral memoirs referring to this period, and written during it, have\r\nbeen first published in our days; since the value of cotemporary\r\nhistorical documents has begun to be sufficiently appreciated. One of\r\nthese publications (Wilna, 1844) is a chronicle referring to the first\r\nhalf of the sixteenth century; and was written by John Tarnowski, the\r\ngeneral mentioned above. The manuscript had been long considered as\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nIt still remains to note the progress made in the philosophical\r\nsciences. We remarked above, that scientific works in Poland were\r\nmostly written in Latin; and since the case with them is different\r\nfrom that of historical works,--because, as the results of scientific\r\nexamination and discovery, they are independent of the country where\r\nthey are written, and belong to the world,--we therefore mention here\r\nonly those works which were published in the Polish language.\r\nFalimierz, in Latin Phalimirus, first ventured to use the vernacular\r\ntongue of the country for a scientific book. He published as early as\r\n1534 a work on natural history, and especially _Materia medica_. The\r\nfirst medical work in the Polish language was written in 1541 by Peter\r\nof Kobylin; the first mathematical work by Grzebski. Their example was\r\nfollowed by Latosz, Rosciszewski, Andrew of Kobylin, Umiastowski,\r\nSpiczynski, Siennik, Oczko, Grutinius, Syrenski, in Latin Sirenius,\r\nand others, all physicians, astronomers, botanists, etc.[36]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From the erection of the Cracovian Jesuit Schools in A.D_. 1622, _to\r\nthe revival of science in A.D_. 1760.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe noble race of the Jagellons had become extinct on the death of\r\nSigismund Augustus, in 1572.[37] Poland had become formally an\r\nelective monarchy. Henry of Valois was the first to subscribe the\r\n_pacta conventa_, the fundamental law of the national liberty; the\r\nnation being understood to consist legally only of the nobility.[38]\r\nStephen Bathory's strength kept the discordant elements together; and\r\nwhile at home he took care to improve the administration of justice,\r\nand erected the high tribunals of Petricau, Lublin, and Wilna, his\r\nvictorious arms in his contest with Russia raised Poland for a short\r\ntime to the summit of its glory. But under his successor Sigismund\r\nIII, a Swedish prince, and nephew of Sigismund Augustus and of\r\nStephen, began that anarchy which is to be considered as the principal\r\ncause of Poland's final calamitous fate. For about fifty years the\r\nPoles still maintained with equal valour, though with alternate good\r\nand ill success, their warlike character abroad; even while internal\r\ndissensions and bloody party strife raged in their own unhappy\r\ncountry. But to such fundamental evils, combined with the rising power\r\nof Russia, with the revolt of the Kozaks in 1654, occasioned\r\nprincipally by religious oppression, and with the gradual but sure\r\nadvancement of a new rival in the elector of Brandenburg, hitherto\r\nconsidered as a weak neighbour--to all these influences, the building\r\nthus sapped in its foundation could make no resistance, and its walls\r\ncould not but give way, when they were suddenly shaken by the hands of\r\navaricious and powerful enemies from without.\r\n\r\nThe perversion of taste, which at the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury reigned in Italy, and thence spread over all Europe, with much\r\nmore rapidity indeed than the true poetry and pure style of the\r\nfifteenth century had done, created also in the literature of Poland a\r\nnew period; which, through the political circumstances above referred\r\nto, was protracted to a greater length than would have been expected\r\nin a literature already so rich in national models. To the remarkable\r\nactivity of mind in the preceding period, there followed a literary\r\nlethargy. A very pernicious influence is also ascribed, by the\r\nliterary historians of Poland, to the Jesuits; although this order is\r\nin general disposed to favour the cultivation of science. Under\r\nSigismund III, they were shrewd enough to make themselves gradually\r\nmasters of nearly all the colleges; and after a long and obstinate\r\nstruggle, even the university of Cracow had to submit. According to\r\nBentkowski, it was principally by their influence, that the tone of\r\npanegyric and of bombast was introduced, which for nearly a hundred\r\nand fifty years disgraced the Polish literature. The tastelessness of\r\nthis style reached its highest point under John Sobieski; when the\r\npanegyrics with which this victorious captain was hailed by his\r\ncourtiers, became the model for all similar productions. The fashion,\r\nfirst introduced at the close of the preceding period, of\r\ninterspersing the Polish language with Latin words and phrases, became\r\nduring the present more and more predominant; and was at length\r\ncarried so far as to give even to Polish words a false Latin sound, by\r\nmeans of a Latin termination. French, German, and Italian forms of\r\nexpression soon obtained the same right. But what was still worse, and\r\nwhat indeed affected the language most of all, was the fact, that even\r\nthe natural structure and well established syntax of the Polish\r\nlanguage had to give place to an injudicious imitation of foreign\r\nidioms. Thus the very circumstance of its great pliancy, one of its\r\nprincipal excellencies, became a source of its corruption.\r\n\r\nPoland, moreover, at a time when the minds of the rest of Europe were\r\ntolerably pacified in a religious respect, became the scene of\r\ntheological controversies full of sophistry and bitterness, the\r\nnatural consequence of the incipient oppression of the dissidents. The\r\nliterature was overwhelmed with pamphlets, stuffed with a shallow\r\nscholastic erudition, and written in a style both bombastic and\r\nvulgar. But the influence of the Jesuits was not limited to literature\r\nand science; it had a still more unhappy result in its active\r\nconsequences. Poland became also during this century the theatre of a\r\nreligious persecution, less authorized by even the semblance of law\r\nthan any which had before, or has since, occurred in other countries.\r\nThe Arians or Unitarians, after having been for more than sixty years\r\ntacitly included in the general appellation of _dissidents_, had to\r\nsustain between the years 1638 and 1658 the utmost rigour of\r\noppression, and were finally banished from the country; and all this\r\nwithout having done any thing to forfeit their rights as dissidents,\r\nfrom which body they had to be formally expelled by the united hatred\r\nof the other Protestants and Catholics, before even a pretext could be\r\ndevised of proceeding lawfully against them. Nor had the Lutherans,\r\nCalvinists, Greeks, and Armenians, who, after the exclusion of the\r\nUnitarians, Quakers, and Anabaptists, were alone comprised under the\r\nname of dissidents, given any occasion for that gradual deprivation\r\nwhich they had to encounter of their lawful rights, in the possession\r\nof which they had been a hundred and fifty years undisturbed. The\r\nstorm which threatened them, first manifested itself publicly in the\r\ndiets of 1717 and 1718, and degenerated at last into open and\r\nshameless persecution. In the year 1724, a quarrel arose at Thorn, on\r\noccasion of a procession of the Jesuits, between the students of one\r\nof their schools and those of the Lutheran gymnasium. A Lutheran mob\r\nintermeddled and committed some excesses; in consequence of which the\r\nJesuit Wolanski, in the name of his order, instituted a lawsuit\r\nagainst the Lutheran magistracy of the city. The result of this\r\nlawsuit was a tragedy, such as only the bloody pages of the books of\r\nthe inquisition can exhibit, and unequalled as to its motives in the\r\nannals of the eighteenth century. All the perpetrators were punished\r\nwith the utmost rigour; while Rösner, the president of the city,\r\ntogether with eleven other citizens, was publicly beheaded, and their\r\nproperty confiscated for the benefit of the order.\r\n\r\nA body which acted in such a spirit, placed at the head of public\r\neducation, could exert but a very injurious influence in a moral and\r\nreligious respect; its influence on the literature and language has\r\nbeen described above. The general mental paralysis and lethargy, which\r\nreigned in Poland during this period, can indeed hardly be ascribed\r\nsolely to their influence; but the latter served greatly to increase\r\nit. For more than twenty years _all_ the schools in the whole country\r\nwere in the hands of the Jesuits; and when in the year 1642 the\r\ncongregation of the Piarists erected their first school in Warsaw,\r\nwhich soon was followed by several others founded by the same order,\r\nthese seminaries had to struggle for nearly a century, watched and\r\noppressed by the jealousy and despotism of the Jesuits, before they\r\ncould acquire any influence consistent with the spirit in which they\r\nwere founded. To the talents and firmness of Stanislaus Konarski,\r\nhimself a Piarist, the Polish literary historians ascribe the\r\nprincipal merits of the final victory of his order. His endeavours\r\nindeed were favoured by a combination of fortunate circumstances.\r\nLiterature and the fine arts found a friend and protector in a gifted\r\nand accomplished king, and in several high-minded noblemen of even\r\nmore than regal authority. But the period of pedantry, perversion of\r\ntaste, and deficiency of true criticism, had already lasted more than\r\na hundred and thirty years. There was much to be done to cleanse the\r\nbeds in the garden of literature from all the weeds which had\r\nluxuriated there, and to fertilize a soil which had so long lain\r\nfallow. The details of these endeavours belong however to the\r\nfollowing period.\r\n\r\nTo the character of the theological literature of this age, we have\r\nabove alluded. Among the Protestant writers were Andrew and Adalbert\r\nWengierski. The works of the latter gave occasion to the polemical\r\ndiscussions of the Jesuit Poszakowski, himself the author of a history\r\nof the Lutheran and of the Calvinistic creed, and of several other\r\nbooks. Other works on subjects of theology and education, or\r\ncollections of sermons and devotional exercises, were published by the\r\nJesuits Szczaniecki, Koialowicz, Sapecki, Poninski, Zulkicwski, and\r\nothers; and the Piarists Gutowski, Wysocki, Rosolecki, and others. The\r\nJesuit Niesiecki wrote a comprehensive biblio-biographical work of\r\ngreat merit, which is considered as one of the best sources for the\r\ninquirer in Polish history and literature.[39] Another Jesuit, Wiiuk\r\nKoialowicz, translated Tacitus' Annals into Polish, and wrote in Latin\r\na history of Lithuania. Knapski, also a Jesuit, published a large\r\ndictionary or \"Thesaurus,\" which is still highly esteemed.\r\nLuhienski, archbishop of Gnesen, wrote in 1740 the first detailed\r\ngeography in the Polish language. One of the most productive writers\r\non various subjects of theology, history, and politics, was\r\nStarowolski, who died in 1656. Fourteen of his forty-seven works are\r\nwritten in Polish, the rest in Latin. We mention further, as\r\ngeographical and historical writers of some merit, the Piarist Kola,\r\nprofessor Saltszewicz, Chodkicwicz, Niemir and Chwalkowski; and as a\r\ndistinguished mathematician and scholar of general information,\r\nBroscius.\r\n\r\nWe conclude this period with the poets of that age; who, although\r\nperhaps they exhibited more talent than the cotemporary prose writers,\r\nmust necessarily, from the nature of poetry, have suffered more from\r\nthe predominant tastelessness of the time. Sam. Twardowski, ob. 1660,\r\nmust be named first; a poet of fine gifts, but of an impure,\r\nbombastic, rhetorical style, the author of numerous lyrical and epic\r\npoems of very unequal value. After him came Vespasian Kochowski, the\r\nbest lyric poet of the age; Gawinski, a very productive author, whose\r\npastorals have been collected by Mostowski, together with those of\r\nKochanowski, Simonides, and other classical poets; and Wenceslaus\r\nPotocki, the author of novels, poetry, and more especially epigrams,\r\nnot without merit, but frequently licentious and indelicate. Among the\r\npoets of this age, who are in some measure distinguished by Polish\r\ncritics, we find also a lady. Elizabeth Druzbacka, a poetess of high\r\nrank, but without a literary education or a knowledge of foreign\r\nlanguages, though not without natural gifts. Satires were written by\r\nDzwonowski and Opalinski; historical and didactic poems by Bialabocki,\r\nprince Jablonowski, and by Leszczynski, father of king Stanislaus\r\nLeszczynski. Ovid was translated by Zebrowski and Otfinowski; Lucan's\r\nPharsalia by Chroscinski, who versified also portions of the Bible;\r\nand again with more fidelity and skill by the Dominican monk\r\nBardzinski.\r\n\r\nOther poets of this age were, prince Lubomirski, who on account of his\r\nwealth and wise sayings is styled the Polish Solomon; prince\r\nWisniowiocki, who published whole poems without the letter _r_,\r\nbecause he could not pronounce that letter; Bratkowski, the author of\r\na series of happy epigrams; Falibogowski, Szymonowski, the Jesuits\r\nIgnes and Poniatowski, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From Stephen Konarski, A.D. 1760, to the Revolution in 1830_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Polish language, at the beginning of this period, was in a\r\nmelancholy state; it was, to use Schaffarik's expression, stripped of\r\nits natural gifts of perspicuity, simplicity, and strength, deformed\r\nby tastelessness, and grown childish and obsolete at the same time. An\r\nable work, _Memoirs_, referring to the period between 1750 and 1760,\r\nwritten by K.H. Kallontaj, and published a few years since by count E.\r\nRaczynski, gives a graphic picture of the miserable and illiterate\r\nstate of society in Poland at that time; and shows clearly how the\r\nseeds of decay and destruction were already scattered with full hands\r\non a susceptible soil. It was a fortunate circumstance, that, just at\r\nthe time when several of the most powerful Polish noblemen began to\r\nfeel an intense and patriotic interest in their neglected\r\nlanguage,--the king Stanislaus Augustus and his uncle prince\r\nCzartoryski at their head,--there awoke a number of gifted minds, who\r\nbegan to plant with so much activity on the long deserted though still\r\nfertile soil, that the field of Polish literature soon flourished and\r\nbore fruit again. These fruits, however artificial and _un_national in\r\ntheir character, could only be compared to green-house productions.\r\nVarious effective measures were taken for the revival of literature,\r\nand also for the promotion of science and art. But the new patrons\r\ncould not afford to wait. The French literature of the day, with all\r\nits levity, shallowness, and splendour, seemed to be a material nearer\r\nat hand and more in harmony with the spirit of the court--the only\r\nschool of revival for Polish literature--than their own national\r\nproductions of former ages. In this way we may explain in part the\r\nfrivolous tone, the shallow-mindedness, which prevail in all the\r\nPolish works of this age; during a period when vehement passions and\r\nfurious contests already tore the country in pieces, and deep sorrow\r\nand grief reigned among all classes of society.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Monitor, a periodical work, to which the best\r\nand ablest men of Poland contributed, first exerted a superficial\r\nhappy influence on the language.[40] Of still more importance in this\r\nrespect was the establishment of a national stage, at the head of\r\nwhich were distinguished and well qualified men. But the measure which\r\nproduced more effect than any other, was the appointment of a\r\ndepartment of Education, resolved upon by the diet of 1775. Public\r\ninstruction was thus made one of the great concerns of the government\r\nitself; and the power of the Jesuits, which had been for some time on\r\nthe decline, was finally annihilated. The rich income of this order\r\nwas henceforth entirely set apart for the benefit of learned\r\ninstitutions, to which free access was given. The provincial or\r\ndepartmental schools throughout the whole kingdom received a new\r\norganization on a different plan; and the university of Cracow resumed\r\nagain its former rights. In respect to the instruction and melioration\r\nof the situation of the common people, we find as yet no attention\r\nwhatever paid to these important subjects. It was not until 1807, or\r\nthe foundation of the duchy of Warsaw under the administration of the\r\nking of Saxony, that the lower classes obtained their rights as men;\r\nand unfortunately even then without the power of availing themselves\r\nof these rights. Stanislaus Augustus, however, and some of his\r\nadvisers and counsellors, acted in this respect with an honest will\r\nand noble intention; and by promoting the general interests of mankind\r\nin literature and science, did much for the social improvement of\r\ntheir own country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, this unhappy country was the scene of the most violent\r\nparty struggles; during which the heads of the parties conducted\r\nthemselves with the most revolting selfishness, and an entire\r\nforgetfulness of all political consequences and of their own moral\r\nresponsibility. The fanaticism of the bishops of Cracow and Warsaw\r\nrefused to the dissidents the restoration of their rights; and Russia\r\nthus acquired the first pretext for intermeddling with Polish affairs.\r\nIn the course of a few years, Poland was reduced to that torn and\r\nbroken state, which induced Catharine II to consider it as a country\r\n\"where one needed only to stoop, in order to pick up something.\" For a\r\nshort time this course of things even seemed to be favourable to\r\nliterature. The minds of men were in a state of excitement, which gave\r\nthem power to produce the greatest and most extraordinary things. But\r\na reaction very naturally followed. After twenty years of mental and\r\npolitical struggles and combats, to sustain which claimed the whole\r\nunited powers of mind and soul,--twenty years numerically productive\r\nin every department,--there followed a mental calm, an intellectual\r\nblank, of more than twelve years.\r\n\r\nIt was, as if with the political dissolution of the kingdom, with the\r\nannihilation of the unity of the nation, this latter had sunk back\r\ninto a state of intellectual paralysis. The interval from A.D. 1795 to\r\nA.D. 1807, in comparison with the years which preceded and have\r\nfollowed, was remarkably poor in productions of value. The literature\r\nof translations rose in an undue proportion, and the purity of the\r\nlanguage suffered considerably. The government of the duchy of Warsaw\r\nacted on wise and truly humane principles; and during the short period\r\nbetween 1807 and 1812, all was done for the improvement of the\r\ncountry, which the unfortunate circumstances of the case permitted.\r\nUnder this administration the number of schools rose from 140 to 634;\r\na commission was instituted for procuring the publication of\r\nappropriate books of instruction in the Polish language; and several\r\nsimilar measures were taken for advancing the best interests of the\r\ncountry. The constitution of the new kingdom of Poland, in 1815,\r\nentered essentially into the same views; and was in every respect\r\nfavourable to the development of the mental faculties of the nation.\r\nThe modern kingdom of Poland embraced, indeed, not much more than the\r\nsixth part of the vast territory, which under the Jagellons had\r\nconstituted the kingdom of that name. Before the cessions at Andrussov\r\nin the year 1667, the ancient kingdom contained sixteen millions of\r\ninhabitants; the census of the modern kingdom in 1818, counted only\r\n2,734,000. But that the population of this exhausted country increased\r\nduring the Russian administration,--especially in consequence of the\r\nencouragement given to foreign colonists, the establishment of\r\nmanufactures which furnished means of support for the lower classes,\r\nand other similar measures,--is apparent from the results of the\r\ncensus of 1827; according to which the kingdom then contained\r\n3,705,000 inhabitants.[41]\r\n\r\nIn the field of science and literature, the nobility had at length\r\nfound rivals among the free citizens; and the courts of these temples\r\nwere now, through the erection of village schools, made accessible\r\neven to the peasant, who was, in name at least, no longer a degraded\r\nslave.[42] If the Russian government in Poland had been exercised in\r\npractice, according to the same principles on which it was founded; if\r\nAlexander's first intentions had been practically executed in the same\r\nspirit in which the happiness of his Polish subjects had been\r\ntheoretically planned; perhaps it would have been less difficult to\r\nreconcile the minds of the Poles to the loss of their independence as\r\na nation, which they justly consider as an inestimable good. We have\r\nhere no concern with politics, except so far as they have a necessary\r\ninfluence on the state of general cultivation; or so far as they give\r\nbirth to important occasional appearances in the republic of letters.\r\nConsidered in the first point of view, it is not to be denied, that\r\nthe Polish nation, since the foundation of the _constitutional_\r\nRussian kingdom of Poland in 1815, has made more progress towards\r\nsocial improvement, and has advanced more towards a state of equality\r\nin a mental and intellectual respect with the countries of middle\r\nEurope, viz. Germany, France and England, than during the whole vast\r\nperiod of their previous existence.\r\n\r\nFor most of these improvements, however, the preparation had already\r\nbeen made, in the last ten years before the dissolution of the\r\nrepublic. The emancipation of the serfs, who comprised the whole\r\npeasantry, one of the fundamental laws of the duchy of Warsaw in 1807,\r\nwas confirmed at the creation of the kingdom of Poland in 1815. In the\r\ndiet of the kingdom, not only the nobility and the government, but\r\nalso the cities and smaller communities, had their own representatives;\r\nand all Christian denominations acquired equal political rights. To\r\nthe universities of Cracow, Wilna, and Lemberg,[43] there was added\r\nin 1818 a fourth at Warsaw. The kingdom of Poland contained in 1827,\r\nin each of its eight woiwodships, a palatine school, and besides this\r\nthree other institutions for the higher branches of education;\r\nfourteen principal department schools, and nine for sub-departments;\r\nseveral professional seminaries for miners, teachers, agriculturists,\r\nand others; a military academy, a school for cadets, and a number of\r\nelementary schools, both private and public.[44] The Russian-Polish\r\nprovinces, i.e. the part of Poland united with Russia in the three\r\nsuccessive dismemberments of Poland, participate in all the means of\r\neducation which the Russian empire affords; the province of West\r\nPrussia and the grand duchy of Posen, in those of the kingdom of\r\nPrussia, where an enlightened government has made, as is generally\r\nacknowledged, the mental improvement of the lower classes one of its\r\nprincipal objects. The Austrian kingdom of Galicia had in the year\r\n1819 two lyceums, twelve gymnasiums, several other institutions for\r\neducation of different names and for specific purposes, and also\r\nnumerous elementary schools. The Catholic religion is here the only\r\nreigning one; although the Protestants, who here are still comprised\r\nunder the name of dissidents, are tolerated.\r\n\r\nThe literary activity of the Polish nation occupied in 1827 not less\r\nthan sixty printing offices and twenty booksellers. Of the latter,\r\nfifteen were in Warsaw, the rest scattered over all the province\r\nformerly belonging to Poland. At Warsaw alone five daily political\r\npapers and one weekly were published in the Polish language; besides\r\nthese there existed only five, viz. one in each of the four larger\r\ncities, Cracow, Lemberg, Wilna, and Posen, and a fifth at St.\r\nPetersburg. There are other periodicals for scientific objects\r\npublished at Warsaw; while in the other cities the German publications\r\nof that character are chiefly read. The periodical published by the\r\nnational institution, called after count Ossolinski, at Lemberg, is\r\nhowever considered as the most important in the Polish language.\r\n\r\nThe high spirit of the Polish nation, and that glowing patriotism for\r\nwhich they are so distinguished, has induced them during the period of\r\ntheir unnatural partition and amalgamation with foreign nations, to\r\ndevote more zeal than ever to the sole national tie which still binds\r\ntogether the subjects of so many different powers--their language.\r\nThere have been numerous learned societies founded; among them, above\r\nall, the society of the friends of science at Warsaw, to which the\r\nmost eminent men of the nation belong, must be distinguished.\r\nAcademies of arts and sciences have been established, and associations\r\nformed for various scientific purposes. The influence of all these\r\ninstitutions, more especially that of the above-mentioned society at\r\nWarsaw, has been very favourably employed in limiting that of the\r\nFrench and German languages, naturally induced by political\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe French language indeed, independently of the political events of\r\nmodern times, had already acted powerfully on the Polish at the close\r\nof the preceding period. In poetry, the affected bombastic school of\r\nthe Gongorists and Marinists had been supplanted throughout all Europe\r\nby the better taste of the cold, stiff, and formal French poets, whose\r\ndefects it was much easier to imitate than their merits. For more than\r\nhalf a century the French language reigned with an uncontrolled and\r\nunlimited sovereignty over all the literary world. But its most\r\nabsolute dominion was in Poland. In the manners of the nobility of\r\nthis country, French gracefulness and ease were, in a peculiar and\r\ninteresting manner, blended with the daring heroism of the knight and\r\nthe luxuriousness of the Asiatic despot. French refinement and French\r\nwitticism covered the rudeness and revelry characteristic of the\r\nmiddle ages. French teachers and governesses had inundated the whole\r\ncountry, and a journey to France was among the requisite conditions of\r\nan accomplished education. The Polish writers--all of them belonging\r\nto the nobility--to whom, from their youth, the French language was\r\nequally familiar with their own, unconsciously disfigured the latter\r\nby Gallicisms; since French forms of expression seemed to be the\r\nbest adapted for the expression of French thoughts and French\r\nphilosophy. A modern Polish author calls the Polish literature of this\r\nperiod a second edition of the French with inferior types and on worse\r\npaper.[45] Long after the rest of literary Europe had shaken off the\r\nyoke, the Polish poets, although the genius of their rich, creative,\r\nand pliant language was decidedly opposed to such a slavery, continued\r\nto submit to French rules and laws, and do so partly still.\r\n\r\nWe begin the enumeration of the distinguished writers of this period,\r\nwith its principal founder, Stephen Konarski, mentioned above,[46] who\r\nwas born A.D. 1700, and died in 1773. In his seventeenth year he\r\nentered the order of Piarists, and became later a professor in the\r\ncollege of this congregation at Warsaw. After a long stay in Italy and\r\nFrance, he returned to Poland; accompanied king Stanislaus Leszczynski\r\nto Lorrain; but again returned to his country and founded several\r\ninstitutions for education in Warsaw, Wilna, and Lemberg, on\r\nprinciples different from those of the Jesuits. In the year 1747 he\r\nwent a third time to France, but returned after three years; and from\r\nthat time devoted himself entirely to the literary and mental reform\r\nof his own country. Of his printed works, twenty-eight in number,\r\nfourteen are written in Polish. They embrace different topics in\r\npoetry, and a tragedy; but his principal merits lie in his writings on\r\nthe subject of politics and education.[47]\r\n\r\nAfter him we name the illustrious philosopher Stanislaus Leszczynski.\r\nMost of his works, on politics and ethics, were written in French; in\r\nthe Polish language he wrote, besides one or two other works, a\r\nhistory of the Old and New Testaments in verse.[48] Zaluski, known\r\nmore especially by the foundation of a large and celebrated library,\r\nin which he spent an immense fortune, and which he finally made over\r\nto his country,[49] was the friend of king Stanislaus and of Konarski.\r\nIn possession of an uncommon amount of knowledge, and a very extensive\r\nerudition, which however he owed more to his remarkable memory than to\r\nany distinguished capacity, he wrote a large number of Latin and\r\nPolish books on literary and biographical subjects, and on poetry; in\r\nall which the genius of the preceding period still reigns.\r\n\r\nAnother nobleman of high rank, who distinguished himself by his\r\npatriotism and erudition, was Wenceslaus Rzewuski, woiwode of Podolia,\r\nand cotemporary with Zaluski, whom he surpassed however in critical\r\ntaste and productive powers. His translation of the Psalms is highly\r\nesteemed. A still higher name as a patron of literature and the arts,\r\nis the uncle of king Stanislaus Augustus, prince Adam Czartoryski. He\r\nwas marshal of the diet in 1764, when the ill-famed _liberum veto_ was\r\nabolished, which gave to every deputy, singly, the right of\r\noverthrowing the otherwise unanimous resolutions of the diet, and thus\r\nwas the principal cause of the lawless disorder which disgraced the\r\nsessions of that body. His merits as a statesman and a Mecænas are\r\nequal. Several historical works, designed to advance the honour of\r\nPoland, were published under his care and at his instigation. Amid all\r\nhis numerous avocations, he found time to write several pieces for the\r\nnational stage; which, as a promoter of the purity of the language,\r\nwas a subject of his particular care and attention.[50]\r\n\r\nBy the side of the name of Czartoryski, shines that of Potocki. More\r\nthan one member of this illustrious family had in former times\r\nacquired the right of citizens in the republic of letters. Count Paul\r\nPotocki and his grandson Anthony, in the seventeenth and beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century, were both equally celebrated for their\r\ntalents. The works of the former were published by count Zaluski,\r\nunder the title of _Genealogia Potockiana_; the speeches and addresses\r\nof the latter are partly printed in Daneykowicz' _Suada Polona_, and\r\nwere in their time considered as models. But the most elevated rank in\r\nthis family is occupied by the two brothers Ignatius and Stanislaus\r\nKostka Potocki, whether as patriots and statesmen, or as writers and\r\npatrons of science. Ignatius, besides promoting several literary\r\nundertakings, and bearing the expenses of more than one journey for\r\nthe purposes of science and learning, was himself a distinguished\r\nwriter. He translated Condillac's work on logic, and introduced it\r\ninto the Polish schools as a class book. His merits in respect to\r\npublic education were great; he was one of the most urgent promoters\r\nof the emancipation of the serfs; and at his death in the year 1809,\r\nhe left behind the reputation of a true friend of the people. His\r\nbrother Stanislaus Kostka, although entertaining the same political\r\nprinciples, did not take the same active part during the struggles of\r\nthe Poles for their expiring independence; he retired to Austria after\r\nthe king had joined the confederation of Targowicz, and there devoted\r\nhimself entirely to his studies. In 1807 he returned to his country;\r\nand there, as president of the department for schools and education,\r\nhe found means to carry out his enlightened views and benevolent\r\nintentions for the good of his country. At the foundation of the\r\nkingdom of Poland in 1815, he was made minister of public instruction,\r\nand was always found at the head of every noble and patriotic\r\nundertaking. From his oratorical powers, he was called _princeps\r\neloquentiæ_. In respect to genius he was above his brother; although\r\nthe latter seems to have surpassed him in energy of character. His\r\nprincipal work, \"on Style and Eloquence,\" was published in 1815;\r\nanother work of value is his translation of Winkelmann's book on\r\nancient art, which he accompanied by illustrations and remarks, but\r\ndid not finish. His influence on Polish literature was decided.[51]\r\nAnother nobleman, distinguished as an orator and political writer, was\r\nHugo Kollantay, count Sztumberg, who published, together with Ignatius\r\nPotocki, a history of the constitution.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the historical writers of this period stands Adam\r\nNaruszewicz, the faithful translator of Tacitus, whose style he\r\nadopted also in his original works. His history of the Polish nation\r\nis considered as a standard work; as a production, which in respect to\r\nerudition, philosophical conception, and style, is the _chef d'oeuvre_\r\nof Polish literature. The six volumes published by himself comprise\r\nonly the period between A.D. 965 and 1386, beginning with the second\r\nvolume; as for the first, which was to have contained the earliest\r\nhistory of Poland, he intended to have executed it afterwards, and had\r\nindeed collected all the necessary materials, but was prevented by\r\ndeath. The Warsaw Society of Friends of Science published it thirty\r\nyears after his death, and endeavoured to engage the principal talents\r\nof Poland in the continuation of his work. This was done in such a\r\nway, that each writer was to undertake the history of the\r\nadministration of a single king; and at last, after each part had\r\nappeared separately, the society was to make a collection of the\r\nwhole, and, if necessary, cause it to be rewritten. Several able men\r\nhave devoted themselves to this work. The plan of the society, which\r\nby its very nature excluded all unity of character, seems to have met\r\nwith more approbation than, according to our opinion, it deserved. The\r\nPolish public is however indebted to it for more than one valuable\r\nwork on history, to which it gave birth. Naruszewicz had collected for\r\nhis undertaking a library of materials, in 360 folio volumes. He wrote\r\nalso a history of the Tartars, a biography of the Lithuanian captain\r\nChodkiewicz, and was admired as a poet. He died in 1796, it is said of\r\ngrief at the fate of his unhappy country.\r\n\r\nNaruszewicz was educated by the Jesuits, and was himself of that order\r\nuntil its dissolution. He died as bishop of Luck. In respect to time\r\nhe stands as the first eminent writer of a new period, just on the\r\nverge of the past; and even his warmest admirers do not deny that he\r\nparticipated, in some slight degree, in the character of that past, by\r\na certain inclination to panegyric and a flowery style. But in energy\r\nand richness of thought, he far surpasses all his predecessors, and\r\nhas not yet been reached by any who have written after him.[52]\r\n\r\nAnother historical work of value on Poland, was edited by Joachim\r\nLelewel. The history of Poland by Waga, in the want of any thing more\r\nsuitable, had been in use as a class book in the Polish schools for\r\nmore than fifty years. Lelewel, in order to improve its popularity,\r\ntook this book as a foundation, but completely recast it, divided the\r\nhistory of Poland according to a plan perfectly new, completed the\r\nwork, and published it under Waga's name. His rich additions regard\r\nchiefly the legislature, statistics, and the cultivation of the\r\ncountry. His very division of the history of Poland, into Poland\r\nconquering, Poland divided, Poland flourishing, and Poland on the\r\ndecline, seems to indicate the political tendency of his work, and his\r\ndesire to impress upon the Polish youth the great moral lessons which\r\nhistory presents.[53]\r\n\r\nAnother history of Poland of more extent was published by G.S.\r\nBantkie. Lelewel said of the second edition of this book, which\r\nappeared in 1820, that \"a more perfect work in this department did not\r\nexist.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable writers of his time, on history and\r\nbibliography, was the Jesuit Albertrandy; who, besides being the\r\nauthor of several historical works and treatises, was indefatigable in\r\ncollecting materials for the history of his country. He went to Italy,\r\nand here gathered during a stay of three years a hundred and ten folio\r\nvolumes of extracts, entirely written with his own hand. He then went\r\nto Stockholm and Upsal, where the most important manuscripts relative\r\nto Poland are deposited. The Swedish government was narrow-minded\r\nenough, to allow him access to their libraries only on condition of\r\nhis not taking any written notes. But Albertrandy had so remarkable\r\na memory, that he was able to make up for this disadvantage, by\r\nwriting down every evening all that he had read during the day, and\r\nadded in this way not less than ninety folio volumes to his library of\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\nPortions of Polish history, or subjects belonging to it, were treated\r\nwith success by the poet Niemcewicz; by Bentkowski, Kwiatkowski,\r\nSoltykowicz, Surowiecki, Lelewel, Onacewicz, the counts Ossolinski and\r\nCzacki, the former distinguished by learning and critical discernment,\r\nthe latter the author of an esteemed history of the Polish and\r\nLithuanian laws; by Maiewski, Siarczynski, and others. The princess\r\nIsabella Czartoryski intended her \"Pilgrim of Dobromil,\" to be a book\r\nof historical instruction for the common people. Abridgments of Polish\r\nhistory were given by Miklaszcwski and Falenski. The historical songs\r\nwritten by Niemcewicz, at the instigation of the Warsaw Society of\r\nFriends of Science, are also to be considered as belonging to history,\r\nas well as to poetry, since they are accompanied by valuable\r\nhistorical illustrations. The same author wrote Memoirs on ancient\r\nPoland. Turski translated the memoirs of Choisain on the\r\nadministration of Henry of Valois; and the memoirs of Michael Oginski,\r\n_Sur la Pologne et les Polonais depuis 1788 jusqu'en 1815_, are a\r\nvaluable contribution to the history of our time. Memoirs of J.\r\nKilinski, a shoemaker by trade, but like the butcher Sierakowski, a\r\nsuccessful revolutionary leader in 1795, were published in 1830. The\r\nmodern periodicals likewise contain many well written historical\r\nessays, some of them of decided importance. This is especially true of\r\nthe _Memoirs_ of Warsaw, and also of Lemberg, the _Scientific\r\nMemoirs_, the Wilna and Warsaw _Journals_, the _Bee_ of Cracow, the\r\n_Ant_ of Poznania, and others.\r\n\r\nWe have remarked above, as a characteristic of the Polish literature,\r\nthat although Poland was never poor in talents of various kinds, yet\r\nits literary contributions have aimed less at the advancement of\r\nscience in general, than to exalt the glory of the Polish name, and\r\nthus have an immediate reflexive influence on the nation. In the same\r\nspirit, the history of other countries has received little attention,\r\nnot excepting even ancient history. Poland indeed does not possess a\r\nsingle distinguished work on foreign history; and their Gibbons and\r\nRobertsons seem ever to have been absorbed in their own patriotic\r\ninterests. As writers of merit on universal history and its auxiliary\r\nbranches, we may mention Cajetan and Vincent Skrzetuski, count John\r\nPotocki, Bohusz, Jodlowski, Sowinski. prince Sapieha, count Berkowski,\r\nand above all Lelewel.[54] Several of his works have been translated\r\ninto French and German. The German version of his History of the\r\ndiscoveries of the Carthaginians and Greeks (Berlin 1832), was\r\naccompanied by an introduction from the celebrated Ritter.\r\n\r\nThe Polish language, the purity of which at the beginning of the\r\npresent period was an object of particular attention, has in our own\r\ncentury been the subject of numerous learned inquiries; some of which\r\nhave added considerably to the light thrown in modern times by\r\nSlavic-German scholars upon the Slavic languages and Slavic history in\r\ngeneral. Linde, besides several other philological and historical\r\nwritings, has enriched Slavic literature with a comparative critical\r\ndictionary in six volumes, which is considered as one of the standard\r\nworks of the language. G.S. Bantkie, the author of several historical\r\nand bibliographical works of great merit in the Polish, Latin, and\r\nGerman languages, has written a Polish grammar and Polish-German\r\ndictionary. Rakowiecki prepared a new edition of the _Jus Russorum_,\r\nintroduced by a critical preface, and accompanied with many\r\nexplanatory notes. We must, however, take this occasion to remark,\r\nthat the Polish critics in general; even if in every other respect\r\nqualified as sagacious and impartial judges, are by no means\r\ninfallible on subjects which have any relation to their own country.\r\nThe glory and honour of their own nation are always with them the\r\nprincipal objects, to which not seldom the impartiality of a\r\nscientific inquirer, and even historical truth, is unscrupulously\r\nsacrificed. Maiewski wrote a book rich in ideas on the Slavi;[55]\r\nbibliographical works, and books on the literary history of Poland\r\nhave been published by Chrominski, Sowinski, Juszynski, count\r\nOssolinski, Szumski, and more especially by Bentkowski.[56] Count\r\nStan. Potocki's works contain likewise a number of articles on Polish\r\nliterature. In the previous periods, all bibliographical works were\r\nwritten in Latin.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant talent of the Poles for eloquence enjoyed, during the\r\nearly part of this period and before the dissolution of the republic,\r\nthe best possible opportunity for development, among the intellectual\r\nstruggles and combats occasioned by the political circumstances of the\r\ncountry and the discussion of new political theories. The\r\nconstitutional diet of 1788-1791 exhibited a rich store of oratorical\r\ntalent. The names of the Potockis, Sapieha, Czartoryski, Kollantay,\r\nMatuszewicz, Niemcewicz, Soltyk, Kicinski, and others, were mentioned\r\nwith distinction. The eloquence of the pulpit was of course much less\r\ncultivated in a nation which lives chiefly in politics. Lachowski, a\r\nJesuit and court preacher of the last king, is by the Poles considered\r\nas an eminent preacher; although according to German judges he was\r\nshallow and voluble, and was surpassed by his cotemporary Wyrwicz, and\r\nabove all by Karpowicz. Prazmowski, Jakubowski, Woronicz bishop of\r\nWarsaw, Szismawski, Szweykowski, Zacharyaszewicz, and others, were\r\nesteemed as powerful preachers.\r\n\r\nBesides the oratorical powers and the historical productions of the\r\nPoles, the reputation of their modern literature rests chiefly on\r\npoetry. Although the Polish poets adhered longer to the strict rules\r\nof Boileau than the rest of Europe, and have only in the most recent\r\ntimes chosen better models in the Germans and English,--without\r\nhowever having been able to free themselves entirely from their French\r\nchains,--yet the national genius of their language has sometimes\r\nconquered the artificial restraints of narrow rules and arbitrary\r\nlaws. Naruscewicz, the celebrated historian, occupies also a\r\ndistinguished rank as a poet. He translated Anacreon and some of\r\nHorace's odes; but wrote still more original pieces, odes, pastorals,\r\nepigrams, satires, and a tragedy entitled 'Guido.'\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished poet under Stanislaus Augustus was count\r\nIgnatius Krasicki, bishop of Ermeland or Warmla, and later of Gnesen,\r\nthe Polish Voltaire. His principal works are an epic under the title\r\nof _Woyna, Chocimska_ or 'War of Chocim,' and three comic epics, one\r\nof which, _Monachomachia_, ridicules the monkish system and exhibits\r\nits absurdity in strong colours. He wrote this poem at the suggestion\r\nof Frederic the Great, to whose _coterie_ of literary friends he\r\nbelonged. His great heroic epic is considered by his countrymen as a\r\nstandard work; while foreigners look at it as a valuable historical\r\npoem indeed, but as utterly deficient in true epic power and original\r\ninvention. His smaller poems and prose writings are replete with wit\r\nand spirit; to see a bishop writing erotic songs and satirical\r\nepigrams was nothing extraordinary in his time. As a prose writer be\r\nappears as one of the few who were not blind to the defects and\r\nfollies of their countrymen. Of his translations we mention\r\nMacpherson's Ossian and Plutarch. He belongs so decidedly to his age,\r\ni.e. to the age of the freezing, unpoetical, French influence, that\r\nour time, with its higher standard for a true poet, can no longer set\r\na great value on his works.[57]\r\n\r\nTrembecki, ob. 1812, as a lyric poet takes equal rank, according to\r\nsome Polish critics, with Krasicki. His chief poem, _Zofiowka_, which\r\nhas been translated into French by La Garde, is of that descriptive,\r\ncontemplative kind, which was fashionable in his day. He had more\r\nimagination than other cotemporary Polish poets. Szymanowski, ob.\r\n1801, a writer of pastorals, is distinguished for delicacy and\r\nsweetness. As to the beauty of his diction his countrymen are the best\r\njudges; but as for the character and real poetical value of his\r\nproductions, we doubt whether the sounder taste of our day would\r\nrelish the whole species so highly as was done at a time, when the\r\nforms of society had reached the very summit of artificial perversion.\r\nA certain longing after nature and its purity was the necessary result\r\nof such a state of things; but even nature itself they were unable to\r\nsee, except in an artificial light. All the Polish productions of this\r\nspecies, in the present period, savour strongly of the French school;\r\nwhilst the pastorals of the sixteenth century hover in the midst\r\nbetween the bucolics of the ancients and the Italian and Spanish\r\neclogues.\r\n\r\nThere was the same decided influence of the French literature on\r\nWengierski, who died in 1787; although less in respect to taste than\r\nto morals. Karpinski, also a writer of pastorals, approaches nearest\r\nthe Greeks, and is on the whole a poet of uncommon talent. His\r\noriginal writings bear much more of a national stamp than those of\r\nother poets of this period. His translation of Racine's Athalia is\r\nconsidered as a masterpiece, and his version of the Psalms has not\r\nbeen surpassed in any language. Another distinguished poet is\r\nDionysius Kniaznin, remarkable for a certain external freshness, which\r\nimparts life to all his productions. He was educated in the college of\r\nthe Jesuits at Witebsk; and it was during his whole life a matter of\r\nregret to him, that he \"had lost the golden season of his youth, and\r\nwasted the labour of sleepless nights on irksome trifles.\"\r\nNotwithstanding this learned education, the author of the Letters on\r\nPoland finds between him and Burns a kind of analogy. Kniaznin's\r\nprincipal fame rests on a ludicrous heroic called the 'Balloon.' He\r\nspent a part of his life at Pulawy, the estate of prince Czartoryski,\r\nunder the patronage of this nobleman; and is said to have become, like\r\nTasso, the victim of a passion for one of his lady patronesses.\r\n\r\nThe following are further regarded among their countrymen as poets of\r\nthe first rank, viz. Niemcewicz, Brodzinski, bishop Woronicz, and\r\nMickiewicz. Julius Niemcewicz is also known by his political fortunes\r\nand influence, and is equally esteemed as an historian and for his\r\npoetical talents. The eloquence which he exhibited in the diet of\r\n1788-92, as the _nuntius_ or deputy of Lithuania, laid the foundation\r\nof his fame. When his country was lost, after having fought at the\r\nside of Kosciuszko and shared his fate as a prisoner, he accompanied\r\nthis great man to America, where he associated with Washington, whose\r\nlife he has since described. His eulogy on Kosciuszko is considered as\r\na masterpiece. His principal works are his historical songs, his\r\ndramas, and his \"Reign of Sigismund III.\" Whatever he writes evinces\r\nmore than common talents; as to which his friends only deplore that he\r\nhas scattered them so much, or, according to the expression of the\r\nauthor of the Letters on Poland, that \"his genius was too eager in\r\nembracing at once so much within its potent grasp; and thus, instead\r\nof concentrating his powers, lessened their brilliant beams, by\r\ndiffusing them over too wide a horizon.\" [58]\r\n\r\nJohn Woronicz, bishop of Cracow, and afterwards of Warsaw, whom we\r\nhave named above as one of the most eloquent preachers, is equally\r\ncelebrated as a poet. His productions all have a character of dignity\r\nand loftiness; and, with the exception of some religious hymns, are\r\ndevoted to the historical fame of his country. His \"Sybil,\" in which\r\nhe conjures up in succession the ancient Polish kings from their\r\ngraves to behold the cruel state of their once triumphant country, and\r\nthe \"Lechiade,\" an epic, which Schaffarik considers as the best Polish\r\nproduction of this species, are his principal works. The inclination\r\nof the Polish poets to celebrate and exalt their own country and the\r\nheroic deeds of their ancestors, without even admitting the\r\npossibility of rivalship on the part of any other nation, can easily\r\nbe accounted for; while to foreign critics the same poems, which\r\ninspire Polish readers with patriotic enthusiasm, often appear pompous\r\nand void of that simplicity, which is the true source of the sublime.\r\n\r\nCasimir Brodzinski, ob. 1835, was an eminent original poet, and an\r\nexcellent translator. His poetry is pervaded by a character of strong\r\nand decided nationality, and Bowring says of him: \"If any man can be\r\nconsidered the representative of Polish feelings, and as having\r\ntransfused them into his productions, Brodzinski is certainly the\r\nman.\" He translated Macpherson's Ossian; and first introduced Scott's\r\nmasterpieces into the literature of Poland. He may be considered as\r\none of the founders of the modern romantic school in Polish\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nAdam Mickiewicz, born in 1798, whose name belongs, perhaps, more\r\nappropriately to the next period, owed his first reputation, as a poet\r\nof eminent talent, to three small volumes of miscellaneous poetry,\r\nfirst published in 1822-1828. A poetic tale, _Conrad Wallenrod_, a\r\nscene from the wars of the Poles with the Teutonic knights, was\r\npublished shortly after.[59]\r\n\r\nThe series of Polish poets towards the end of this period, who have\r\nmanifested some talent, is too long to permit us to enumerate them\r\nall; and even a complete catalogue of their names must not be expected\r\nin these pages, which are devoted merely to an historical review of\r\nthe _whole_ literature, and to individuals only so far as they go to\r\nform characteristic features of the physiognomy of the former. The\r\n\"Dictionary of Polish poets,\" published in 1820 by Juszynski,\r\ndescribes the lives of not less than 1400 individuals, independently\r\nof course of their poetical worth. We confine ourselves to presenting\r\nsome of the most distinguished names in addition to those\r\nabove-mentioned, viz. Gurski, a very productive and popular writer; L.\r\nOsinski, still more esteemed as a critic: Molski, Tanski, Boncza\r\nTomaszewski, Okraszewski, Tymowski, Szydlowski, and Kozmian, the\r\nauthor of a popular didactic poem.\r\n\r\nThe Polish literature of this time was particularly rich in\r\ntranslations, which are approved by their countrymen, although they\r\nperhaps will not satisfy the higher standard of German or English\r\ncriticism. This is due partly to the richness and pliability of the\r\nlanguage itself. Dmochowski, Przybylski, and Staszyc, translated\r\nHomer; and the first also Virgil. Dmochowski's translations are in\r\nrhymed verse; those of Przybylski, who also enriched Polish literature\r\nwith translations of the Paradise Lost, the Lusiad, and of many other\r\npoems, are in the measures of the originals, and manifest both a\r\nprofound knowledge of the foreign languages, and great dexterity in\r\nusing his own. Staszyc has written valuable works on various subjects,\r\nand enjoys a high esteem as a literary man and patriot. Felinski, the\r\ntranslator of Delille and Racine, is considered as the most harmonious\r\nPolish versifier. Hodani, Osinski, Kicinski, Kruszynski, have likewise\r\ntransplanted the productions of the French Parnassus into the Polish\r\nsoil; Sienkiewicz, Odyniec, and others, devoted their talents to the\r\nEnglish. Okrascewski translated the Greek tragic poets. Minasowicz,\r\nthe author of fifty-three various works, and Nagurczewski, translated\r\nalso several of the ancient authors; but according to the best\r\ncritics, with more knowledge of the classic languages, than skill in\r\nthe management of their own. Among all the distinguished poets\r\nmentioned above, there is hardly one, who, besides his original\r\nproductions, did not likewise devote his talents to poetical\r\ntranslations; in which Karpinski, Naruscewicz, and Krasicki, were\r\nconsidered as eminently successful.\r\n\r\nIn the whole domain of poetry, there is no branch in which the Poles\r\nmanifested a greater want of _original_ power, than the dramatic. Here\r\nthe influence of the French school was most decided, and indeed\r\nexclusive. We have seen above what pains were taken by the most\r\ndistinguished men of the nation, to establish a national stage; to\r\nwhich they looked, not in the light of a frivolous amusement, but as a\r\nschool for purifying and elevating the national language and literary\r\ntaste, and also as a means of correcting vice by ridiculing it. In\r\nthis view several clergymen wrote for the theatre. The Jesuit\r\nBohomolec wrote the first original comedies in 1757; other comedies,\r\nvaluable as pictures of the time, were written by bishop\r\nKossakowski. Prince Czartoryski we have mentioned above as a writer of\r\ndramas. Zablocki, Lipinski, Osinski, Kowalski, and others,\r\ntransplanted the French masterpieces to the Polish stage, or imitated\r\nthem. The actors, Boguslawski, Bielawski, and Zolkowski, wrote\r\noriginal pieces. Tragedies, mostly on subjects of Polish history, were\r\nwritten by Niemcewicz, Felinski, Dembowski, Slowacki, Kropinski.\r\nHofmann, and F. Wenzyk, whose \"Glinski\" is considered as the best\r\nPolish production of this kind. The most popular comedies in recent\r\ntimes are by count Fredro, who is called the Polish Molière. The\r\nPolish stage is still richer in melo-dramas, especially rural pictures\r\nin a dramatic form; of which Niemcewicz's piece, \"John Kochanowski,\"\r\nis a fine specimen.\r\n\r\nAs it respects novels, tales in prose, and similar productions, the\r\nliterature of Poland has been much less overwhelmed with this species\r\nof writing, in which mediocrity is so easy and perfection so rare,\r\nthan that of their neighbours the Russians. We think this can easily\r\nbe accounted for. They possess few, for the same reason that the\r\nEnglish are so rich in them. Domestic life, the true basis of the\r\nmodern novel, has no charms in Poland. The whole tendency of the\r\nnation is towards public life, splendour, military fame; theirs are\r\nnot the modest virtues of private retirement, but the heroic deeds of\r\npublic renown. The beauty, the spirit, the influence of their women,\r\nis generally acknowledged; but that female reserve and delicacy which\r\ndraws the thread of an English novel through three volumes, would be\r\nlooked for in vain in Poland. Niemcewicz, however, published in 1827\r\nan historical novel, \"John of Trenczyn,\" which is considered as a\r\nhappy imitation of Scott. Others were written by count Skarbeck. Among\r\nthe novels, which present a psychological development of character,\r\nand a description of fashionable life, \"The Intimations of the Heart\"\r\nis regarded as the principal work. It was written by the princess of\r\nWirtemberg, daughter of Adam and Isabella Czartoryski. Another\r\nesteemed female writer is Clementina Hofmann, formerly Tanska.\r\n\r\nThe Poles, although from a feeling of pride and patriotism naturally\r\ndisposed to overrate the productions of their own literature, are far\r\nfrom being deficient in critical judgment or in exalted ideas on the\r\ntheory of the beautiful. The count Stanislaus Potocki and Ossolinski,\r\nL. Osinski, Golanski, and others, maintain a high rank in this\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy, as an abstract science, independently of its immediate\r\napplication to subjects of real life, has never found more than a few\r\nvotaries among the Poles. In the beginning of the seventeenth century,\r\nAristotle was translated into Polish by Petryci. For nearly two\r\nhundred years, the teachers of philosophy in the Polish universities\r\nstopped at Aristotle; and a few commentaries on his Ethics and\r\nPolitics composed the whole philosophical literature of Poland. In the\r\nfirst years of our own century, Jaronski and Szianiawski made an\r\nattempt to introduce the philosophy of Kant; but although the cause\r\nappeared to be in the best hands, they met with little success.\r\nGaluchowski, a German philosophical writer of merit, is a Pole by\r\nbirth;[60] as also Trentovski and Cieszkowski, followers of Hegel, who\r\nprefer the German for their organ.[61]\r\n\r\nFor the study of polite literature and the Slavic languages during\r\nthis period, Warsaw was the principal seat; for philology and the\r\nexact sciences, the university of Wilna. This learned institution had\r\ntaken special pains in respect to the necessary elementary books for\r\nthe study of the classical languages; and was distinguished by its\r\nable professors Groddek, Bobrowski, and Zukowski. The former, a\r\nscholar of high reputation, in addition to several philological works,\r\ntranslated Buttman's Greek Grammar into Polish; the latter published\r\nalso a Greek and a Hebrew Grammar. In the oriental languages Senkowski\r\nat St. Petersburgh is distinguished; and count Rzewuski at Vienna had\r\ngreat desert in connection with the periodical work, _Fundgruben des\r\nOrients_.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the grand-duke Constantine's predilection for\r\nmathematics, an undue share of attention, after the erection of a\r\nkingdom of Poland under his administration, was paid in schools to the\r\nexact or empirical sciences; _undue_ we call it, because on account of\r\nits excess, the moral and literary pursuits of the pupils were\r\nnecessarily neglected. Mathematics, during this whole period, were\r\ntaught by several eminent men; by John Sniadecki, who is at the same\r\ntime considered as a model in respect to style and language; by\r\nPoezobut, Zaborowski, Czech, Rogalinski, and others. In the same\r\ndepartments the names of Twardowski, Polinski, and Konkowski, must be\r\nhonourably mentioned. Count Sierakowski wrote a classical work on\r\narchitecture; and the learned Polish Jew Stern is celebrated over all\r\nEurope as the inventor of arithmetical and agricultural machines.\r\nCount Chodkiewicz and Andrew Sniadecki are distinguished chemists.\r\nNatural philosophy, although less studied, had able professors in H.\r\nOsinski and Bystrzycki; natural history, more particularly botany and\r\nzoology, in Kluk and Jundzill. Medicine, until the middle of the last\r\ncentury, was in Poland exclusively in the hands of foreigners,\r\nespecially Germans and French [62] since then several gifted Poles\r\nhave devoted themselves to this science, although they have not yet\r\nformed a national school. Lafontaine, body physician of the last king,\r\nDziarkowski, Perzyna, Malcz, and others, must be mentioned here. The\r\nuniversity of Wilna was the most celebrated school for medical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nAmong the reflecting statesmen of Poland, in the second decennium of\r\nour century, there began to be a great deal of attention bestowed on\r\nnational economy and its various branches; more especially on studies\r\nconnected with agriculture, as being the science most applicable to\r\nthe present wants of the country. Poland being the most extensive\r\nplain in Europe, and for the most part of a very rich and fertile\r\nsoil, the Poles would seem destined by nature to be an agricultural\r\npeople. We cannot but observe here, that from this very circumstance,\r\nthe wretched state of the labouring classes is placed in a still more\r\nstriking light. The interests of agricultural science have been\r\npromoted by different societies, and several able treatises on those\r\nsubjects have been published; although it does not appear that any new\r\ntheory or principles have been started. Of all the branches of moral\r\nscience, political economy has met in Poland with the most disciples.\r\nValuable statistical works on Poland in the Polish language have been\r\nwritten by Staszyc, honourably mentioned above;[63] by Slawiarski, and\r\nothers. Swiencki in his 'Geography of ancient Poland,' Surowiecki in\r\nhis 'History of the Polish towns and peasantry,' give very valuable\r\nstatistical notices; and the 'Journey to Constantinople and Troy' by\r\ncount Raczynski, contains an exact statistical account of Podolia and\r\nthe Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe science of law must ever have been in a melancholy state in a\r\ncountry like Poland. Poland proper has always been governed by\r\n_statutes_ and _constitutions_, sanctioned by the diet.\r\n\r\nThese were either founded on ancient usages, _consuetudines_, or\r\noccasioned by particular circumstances. The towns were governed\r\naccording to the code of Magdeburg. In Lithuania the ancient\r\nLithuanian statutes, collected in 1529, prevailed and still prevail,\r\nif not in collision with any intervening _ukase_.[64] In the other\r\nprovinces, the laws of the respective monarchies to which they are\r\nannexed, are in force. Thus the different portions of Poland are\r\ngoverned in accordance with seven different systems of law.[65] Under\r\nthe administration of the last king of Poland, which was so rich in\r\nimprovements; a general code of laws was also planned, and projects\r\nwere prepared by able statesmen and lawyers; but they were all\r\nrejected by the diet of 1777. Under the Russian administration,\r\npreparation was made from the very beginning for the introduction of a\r\nnew code; but the first project of a criminal code presented by the\r\ncouncil of state, was likewise rejected by the diet of 1820. A portion\r\nof the civil code was accepted in A.D. 1825; but the complete code,\r\nwhich was ready for publication in the year 1830, had not, so far as\r\nwe are informed, been introduced before the outbreak of the\r\nrevolution. The administration of justice in Poland is about as bad as\r\nin Russia; being nothing but one great system of bribery and\r\ncorruption. Of the judges of the lower courts, two thirds are elected;\r\none third of these, and all the officers of the higher tribunals, are\r\nappointed by the government. In former times the profession of a\r\nlawyer, as well as that of a physician, was considered in Poland as\r\ndegrading and unworthy of a nobleman. These two professions were not\r\nindeed prohibited by law, like that of traders,--for a nobleman who\r\nretailed \"by yards or by pints,\" legally lost his rank,--but custom\r\nhad made all those occupations which were the source of pecuniary\r\nprofit, equally the objects of contempt. There was even a time, \"when\r\nit was reckoned a matter of indifference for a nobleman _to understand\r\narithmetic_[66].\" In modern times the ideas on this subject have of\r\ncourse changed; the study of law is no longer despised, especially in\r\nits necessary connection with the administration of justice.\r\nSlotwinski in Cracow, Bantkie and Maciejowski in Warsaw, were esteemed\r\nas teachers of law. We shall hereafter have occasion to mention the\r\nvaluable work of the latter on this subject. The Roman law, both civil\r\nand criminal, was studied in the universities, as well as the law of\r\nnature and nations; which latter, in the case of this unhappy country,\r\nhas been for more than seventy years so cruelly violated.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact, that although, down to the year 1818 when the\r\nRussian government interfered to prevent it, foreign travel was one of\r\nthe favourite means of education among the Polish nobility, their\r\nliterature exhibits hardly any books of travels. A few were formerly\r\nwritten in Latin or French; among the latter we mention John Potocki's\r\n'Travels for the purpose of discovering Slavic antiquities,' Hamb.\r\n1795. In more modern times count Raczynski has published the 'Journal\r\nof his travels to Constantinople and the plain of Troy,' richly\r\nembellished with illustrations, mentioned above.[67] A view of Great\r\nBritain was given in 1828 by Ljach Szyrma, under the title _Anglia i\r\nSzkocya_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH PERIOD.\r\n\r\n_From the Polish Revolution in 1830 to the present time_.\r\n\r\nWe have thus brought down the history of Polish literature to the year\r\n1830; an epoch of glorious, although most melancholy moment in the\r\nhistory of Poland. If the literature of a country could ever be\r\nregarded completely _in abstracto_; if it was not in intimate\r\nconnection with the political fate and position of its country; we\r\nwould have commenced this period with the first combats of the\r\nRomantic and Classical schools, that is, about fifteen years\r\nearlier.[68] But while these fifteen years may be considered in some\r\nmeasure as the time of the fermentation of that spirit, which broke\r\nout in 1830; this latter year--with its melancholy attempts on the\r\npart of Russia to crush all Polish nationality, by the annihilation of\r\ntheir higher seats of learning and the spoliation of all their\r\nlibraries, as the principal means of cultivating it--forms only too\r\ndistinctly an epoch, not only in Polish history in general, but\r\nspecially in Polish literature.\r\n\r\nThe state of the country on the whole in the beginning of 1830 was not\r\nunprosperous. The cruel wrongs inflicted on the Poles since 1815 were\r\nall in express violation of a constitution, which met with the\r\napprobation of Kosciuszko and the best of the nation. A noble\r\nindividual, or a high-spirited people, can more easily submit even\r\nto unjust laws, than to arbitrary despotism. _Legally_ the Grand Duke\r\nhad no right to keep a single Russian soldier in Poland; by the terms\r\nof the constitution they could be there only as foreign guests.\r\n_Legally_ the press was free. _Legally_ Poland could have defended\r\nherself by her charter against any arbitrary act of her sovereign or\r\nhis viceroy. It would seem, however, that even the repeated\r\ninfringements of the constitution, and the direct violation of the\r\nlaws by the government, did not contribute so much to induce the Poles\r\nto insurrection, as the fierce and brutal behaviour of the Russian\r\ngeneralissimo, and of the Russian civil and military officers high and\r\nlow, whose profligacy had long made them the objects of deep contempt.\r\nThe annals of Warsaw indeed present, during the Russian\r\nadministration, one of the most revolting pictures which history\r\nexhibits. And the idea, that it owes its darkest shades principally to\r\nthe reckless despotism of one individual, serves only to make them\r\nappear still darker.\r\n\r\nThe war, which called into exercise all the mental faculties of the\r\nnation, put a stop of course to all literary activity; but even during\r\nthe more quiet period which immediately succeeded it--the quietness of\r\na cemetery--the dejected spirits of the nation, whose noblest sons an\r\ninterval of two years had rendered prisoners, exiles, or corpses, are\r\neasily to be perceived in the results of their intellectual pursuits.\r\nA small volume, containing three poems by Niemcewiecz and Mickiewicz\r\nwas printed in 1833 at Leipzig. It is the swan-like melody of the aged\r\npoet; whilst the younger celebrates the exploits of his valiant\r\nbrethren. To the poems of the latter, (three volumes, Paris 1828.) a\r\nfourth volume was added, containing the riper productions of his\r\nmanhood. The late vice president of Warsaw, Xavier Bronikowski,\r\npublished at the same time _Polnische Miscellen_ in the German\r\nlanguage at Nuremberg. A number of Polish literati were gathered at\r\nParis. A work, intended to contain about twelve volumes, with the\r\ntitle _Souvenirs de la Pologne, historique, statistique, et\r\nliteraire_, was announced in that city; for the printing offices at\r\nhome were of course closed against the expression of all patriotic\r\nfeelings. The fifteen printing establishments at Warsaw issued in the\r\nyear 1832, from March to December, only sixty-three works.\r\n\r\nThe universities of Warsaw and Wilna were broken up; and the rich\r\nlibraries of these institutions were carried to St. Petersburgh. The\r\nemperor declared openly, that it should be his aim to annihilate all\r\ntraces of _Polish_ nationality, and to metamorphose it into a Russian\r\npeople. Even the lower schools were in great part deprived of their\r\nfunds, and changed to Russian government schools. After some years of\r\nutter privation as to all means of higher instruction, a new\r\nuniversity for the Poles was founded at Kief; of course on a Russian\r\nmodel and in a Russian spirit. In a most consistent and energetic\r\nmanner the language and the national peculiarities of the country were\r\nevery where checked and persecuted; and attempts of every kind were\r\nmade to replace them by Russian customs and the Russian language. The\r\nunion of the Greek and Catholic churches was dissolved; and in that\r\nway thousands were compelled to join the Russian church. In the higher\r\nschools prizes were set forth for the best essays in the Russian\r\nlanguage; and in 1833 a law was made, that after 1834 no Pole could\r\nhope for employment in the Russian service, without a complete\r\nknowledge of the Russian language. In the White Russian provinces, so\r\ncalled, that is in Lithuania, Podolia, and Volhynia,--countries which\r\nformerly had been under Russian dominion, and are still inhabited by a\r\nLithuanian and Russian peasantry, while the nobility is Polish,--these\r\nsevere and arbitrary measures were surprisingly successful in respect\r\nto the youth then in training; and the minister of the School\r\ndepartment, Ouwarof, in his report of 1839, expressed his satisfaction\r\nin the strongest terms.\r\n\r\nBut Poland as a whole was far from giving satisfaction to the\r\ngovernment. There was indeed a certain stoppage of mental life, which\r\nseemed to favour its views. Literary productions were few in\r\nproportion to the former productiveness. In the year 1837, not more\r\nthan 118 books were published in the whole kingdom; and of these only\r\n75 were Polish; the rest in Hebrew. The press and all other organs of\r\npublic feeling were under the strictest control. Yet the very topics,\r\nwhich were chosen by the literati for their researches and\r\ncommentaries, proved best of all that the love of their country was\r\nnot extinguished. The history of Poland became more than ever a chosen\r\nstudy. Private libraries and archives were searched for materials; and\r\ndetached parts of the past, and single branches of history, were made\r\nthe subjects of a closer examination and research, than had ever\r\nbefore been devoted to such topics among this active and restless\r\npeople. One of the most important works, issued immediately after the\r\nrevolution, was Prof. Maciejowski's History of the Slavic\r\nLegislatures.[69] It was well received by the numerous German and\r\nSlavic scholars, who devote themselves to similar pursuits; but they\r\nsoon found that it did not fully satisfy the claims of the deeper\r\ncriticism of our days. It has come finally to be considered rather as\r\na preparatory work, which was shortly afterwards partially completed\r\nby another production of the same author: \"Contributions to the\r\nHistory of Slavic events, literature, and legislation.\" [70] A work by\r\nJ. Hobe, \"On the Slavic rights of inheritance,\" appeared about the\r\nsame time; also, a publication of the oldest Slavic documents relating\r\nto law by Prof. Kucharski.[71]\r\n\r\nAs valuable monographs must be mentioned, the history of queen Barbara\r\nRadzivil, from sources hitherto unknown, by M. Balinski, who wrote\r\nalso a history of Wilna; the biographies of the Hetmans, by Zegota\r\nPauli; a history of Posen, by Lukaszewicz; of Lithuania, by Th.\r\nNarbutt: of Poland in the first half of the sixteenth century, by\r\nMaraczewski; historical and topographical descriptions, relating also\r\nto language and manners, by Przezdziecki and by Kraszewski. We may\r\nalso notice here the History of the Latin Language in Poland, by Dr.\r\nMacherzynski; a book considered as a mine of erudition and useful\r\nknowledge. To it is annexed a list of all the different editions of\r\nthe Classics published in Poland. We learn from it that Cicero's works\r\nhave been edited there, either complete or in particular portions, not\r\nless than forty-five times; first as early as A.D. 1500, at Cracow.\r\nHorace also has appeared eight times, first in 1521; Ovid four times,\r\nfirst in 1529; Virgil six times, first in 1642.\r\n\r\nThe publication of early chronicles, for the purpose of rendering them\r\nmore accessible to the public, was continued. That of Lemberg was\r\nedited by D. Zubrzycki in 1844; that of Cracow, by Macynski in\r\n1845.[72] Archæological researches have continued to excite an\r\ninterest. The dust of centuries has been shaken from many a valuable\r\ndocument; and there have been published in succession, A. Grabowski's\r\nHistorical Antiquities of Poland,[73] the Antiquities of Galicia by\r\nZegota Pauli,[74] and a work on Polish Archaeology by count Eustace\r\nT.[75] Here belongs also the Collection of important historical\r\nDocuments, edited in 1847;[76] and a series of numismatic\r\npublications, by Lelewel, who wrote in exile, by Poplinski, by Ig.\r\nZagorski and E. Rastawiecki, and above all by count E. Raczynski.[77]\r\nThe patriotic exertions of this nobleman, who has caused many a\r\nvaluable old manuscript to be printed; and who has never seemed to be\r\nafraid of any sacrifice, when the promotion of science and literature\r\nis concerned; deserve the highest praise, and ought to serve as a\r\nmodel to others of noble name.\r\n\r\nChurch history also, a department hitherto entirely neglected, in\r\nPoland, has begun to receive some small degree of attention in the\r\npresent period. Joseph Lukascewicz wrote a history of the Bohemian\r\nCongregations in Poland,[78] in 1835; and in 1846 a history of the\r\nHelvetian (Calvinistic) Confession in Lithuania. Count Valerian\r\nKrasinski, who found a home in England, has likewise published a\r\nhistory of the Reformation in Poland, in the English language.[79]\r\n\r\nThe history of recent times cannot be expected to be written in\r\nPoland; where the pen is chained, even if the mind keeps itself\r\nunfettered. The republic of Cracow, until about ten years ago, enjoyed\r\na certain degree of liberty. It could have become the asylum of Polish\r\nliterature and science; but it became only too soon the battlefield of\r\npolitical passions and combats. Some of her scholars however kept\r\nthemselves entirely aloof from the strife. Macherzinski's and\r\nMuczkowski's learned works, already mentioned above; a history of\r\nPolish Literature by Wisznewski; and a new Polish Dictionary, by\r\nTrajanski; were the immediate results.\r\n\r\nNew works of travels have been written by Kraszewski and Holawinski;\r\nthe former describing the South of Russia, and the latter his\r\npilgrimage to the Holy Land; both were published in 1845. A book of\r\ntravels on Siberia, a land so seldom chosen for a tour of pleasure,\r\nhad preceded them.[80]\r\n\r\nModern history, we have said, cannot be expected to be written in\r\nPoland. This remark leads us at once to the literature of Polish\r\nEmigrants, as it is generally called, which has sprung up in Paris.\r\nSince the revolution of 1830, this capital has been the principal seat\r\nof Polish literary activity. One of the first works of importance\r\npublished there was Maurice Mochnacki's History of the Polish\r\ninsurrection; which excited among his own countrymen a new and\r\npassionate feud. Mochnacki's name had been favourably known as the\r\nauthor of a work on the Polish literature of the nineteenth\r\ncentury;[81] and as the able editor of several periodicals. His\r\npolitical misfortunes, however, and especially the circumstance that\r\nhe had been compelled to appear alternately as the tool of the grand\r\nduke Constantine, and as the victim of his hatred, made him a subject\r\nof distrust to his countrymen, although he had fought with bravery in\r\nthe revolution. He died in France when not yet thirty years old. His\r\nscattered writings were published in 1836 by A. Jelowicki, one of the\r\npatriotic family of that name; who had been deeply implicated in the\r\nrevolution, and lived as fugitives in Paris. A printing office,\r\nwhich they have founded there, serves for the publication of Polish\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nAnother work on the recent events was written by Wratnowski, who\r\npublished a history of the insurrection in Volhynia, Paris. 1837. An\r\nanimated picture of the time, which appeared three years ago under the\r\ntitle, \"Representation of the national spirit in Poland.\" by\r\nOjczyczniak,[82] exhibits strong passions in the author; a glowing and\r\ncertainly not unnatural hatred against the great powers; but a still\r\nmore violent one against his _democratic_ countrymen, to whom he\r\nimputes the perdition of the good cause. A history of the Polish\r\ninsurrection, published by S.B. Gnorowski in the English language.\r\nLond. 1839, is written in the same violent and prejudiced spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Slavic press in Paris has been especially productive in\r\nperiodicals; all of them replete with passion and hatred against their\r\noppressors; some of them conducted not without talent. The _Revue\r\nSlave_, the _Mlada Polska_, (young Poland), the _Cronika, Emigracyi\r\nPolskiej_ (Polish Emigrant's Chronicle), and the _Polish Vademecum_\r\nedited by N.U. Hoffmann, may be named here. From the latter we learn,\r\nthat, from 1831 to 1837 among the Polish emigrants in France, _nine_\r\ndied in duels and _fourteen_ by suicide.\r\n\r\nJoachim Lelewel, whose _literary_ activity belongs rather to the\r\npreceding period, while that now under consideration was partly the\r\nresult of his _political_ career, lives still at Brussels, where he\r\nhas recently published (1849) a work on the civil rights of the Polish\r\npeasantry. He attempts to demonstrate, that the oppression and the\r\ndebased condition of this class came upon them along with the\r\nintroduction of Christianity; and represents the Romish clergy, whose\r\nadvantage it was to keep up this state of things, as the principal\r\nenemies of the peasantry. Lelewel's writings have wielded a more\r\ndecided influence in Poland than those of any other modern author. The\r\ntendency of all his historical investigations, even when apparently\r\nwithout any such design, has been since the very beginning of the\r\nRussian dominion to undermine their power; and the great ability with\r\nwhich he contrived to veil hints, to disguise remarks, and to follow\r\nout under a harmless mask a certain and fixed purpose, had earned him\r\ntwenty or thirty years ago the name of the \"Jesuit of history.\"\r\n\r\nIt remains now to give a general survey of the progress of Polish\r\n_belles-lettres_ during the last twenty years; and also of those mixed\r\npublications which excite a general interest. Here we must not omit to\r\nmention Witwicki's the \"Evening Hours of a Pilgrim,\" [83] a book\r\nwhich, in a sprightly style and a peculiarly interesting way, gives a\r\ngood deal of information as to the literary and mental condition of\r\nPoland, and the much-lauded revival of letters during the reign of\r\nStanislaus Poniatowski.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most interesting production of this period is Adam\r\nMickiewicz's course of Lectures on Slavic literature and the condition\r\nof the Slavic nations, delivered in French at Paris, where he had\r\nfound employment as a professor in the College de France.[84] The deep\r\nenthusiasm which pervades these lectures, the mental excitement by\r\nwhich they would seem to have been dictated from beginning to end,\r\nforbid us to consider them in the ordinary light of a mere course of\r\ninstruction on the subject to which they relate. But there is no other\r\nwork more full of ideas, or richer in thought; it is the reasoning of\r\na poet, and a poet's way of viewing the world. The one great\r\nprinciple of these lectures again is _Panslavism_,--Panslavism\r\nspiritualized and idealized; and therefore in a shape which can\r\ninspire little fear to others in respect to their own nationality,\r\nalthough it can never excite their sympathies. Mickiewicz still\r\nidolizes Napoleon, and prophesies a revolution of the world; a new\r\nrevolution, a torch to illumine the world; he himself is \"a spark,\r\nfallen from that torch;\" his mission is to prophesy to the world the\r\ncoming events \"as a living witness of the new revelation,\" Although\r\nthese prophecies are not strictly political, we can see plainly, that\r\nin the expectation of the prophet this new revolution will consist in\r\n\"the union of the _force_ of Slavic genius, with the _knowledge_ of\r\nthe West\" (France); by which of course the intermediate Teutonic\r\nprinciple must be crushed.\r\n\r\nIn purely poetical creations, this great poet shows his full power. In\r\na beautiful tale, _Pan Tadeusz_, \"Sir Thaddeus,\" (Paris 1834,) which,\r\nthough in verse, may be considered as a novel, he very graphically\r\ndescribed the civil and domestic life existing in Lithuania\r\nimmediately before the war of 1812; and gave also further evidence of\r\nhis genius by several smaller poems. He is, however, not very\r\nproductive; a striking peculiarity of Slavic poets.\r\n\r\nThe principal poets of the modern romantic school in Poland, of which\r\nMickiewicz must be considered the founder, are the following:\r\n\r\nA.E. Odyniec and Julian Korssak, both chiefly known by happy\r\ntranslations from the English; but also not without creative power of\r\ntheir own. Anton Malczeski is the author of a poetical tale,\r\n_Maria_,[85] perhaps the most popular production of the Polish\r\nliterature. It is a touching family legend, traditional in the noble\r\nhouse of Potocki in Volhynia; but transposed by Malczeski to the\r\nUkraine, and connected in that way with graphic descriptions of this\r\nlatter country. Malczeski lived a life of wild adventures; and died\r\nyoung, not yet 34 years old, in 1826.\r\n\r\nThe Ukraine appears to be, on the whole, one of the favourite theatres\r\nfor the romantic school of Polish poets. Zaleski, Gosczynski,\r\nGrabowski, all of them poets of more than ordinary talents, give us\r\npictures of this country, alternately sweet and rough, wild and\r\nromantic. There must necessarily be some mixture of attractive and\r\nrepulsive elements here even for native poets; for the common people\r\nare Russians, and hate the Polish nobility as their oppressors.\r\nNevertheless Thomas Padura, another of the young Polish school, chose\r\neven the dialect of the Ruthenian peasantry for his songs. Another\r\nPolish poet, who has selected the Ukraine for the theatre of most of\r\nhis tales, is Michael Czaykowski; he too is considered as standing at\r\nthe head of the novel writers of his country. His legends of the\r\nKozaks[86], his tales, _Wernyhora_[87], _Kirdzali_, the Hetman of the\r\nUkraine[88], etc. manifest a more than common talent.\r\n\r\nTo the poetical literature of the Polish emigrants belong further the\r\nworks of A. Gorecki, Garczinski, J. Slawacki, but, above all, of count\r\nIgnatius Krasinski; not the same individual who wrote a history of the\r\nReformation in Poland in the English language[89]. He is by many of\r\nhis countrymen considered as their greatest living poet. Most of his\r\nproductions are enveloped in a certain mystical atmosphere, which\r\nrenders a commentary necessary in order to understand them. Two\r\ndramatic poems, one called, in contrast to Dante, \"The Undivine\r\nComedy;\" the other, \"Irydion,\" an illustration of Schiller's stern\r\napothegm, that \"the history of the world is the judgment of the\r\nworld;\" [90] are regarded as his most powerful productions[91].\r\n\r\nMeanwhile this department of literature, in Poland itself, has taken,\r\nin some of its branches, the same strictly national direction which\r\ncharacterizes the Russian and Bohemian tendencies of modern times.\r\nMany of the publications, which are reckoned under belles-lettres, are\r\nnothing better than drawing-room productions, so called, meant to\r\nsatisfy the immediate wants of the reading world. Count Skarbek, J.\r\nKrascewski, F. Barnatowicz (ob. 1838), K. Korwell, Szabranski, and\r\nothers, are popular novel writers. Among the poets we mention the same\r\nSzabranski, Nowasielski, Zialinski, Alex. Groza, Burski, and, above\r\nall, Lucian Siemienski and A. Bielowski. The latter, along with\r\nKamienski, is the translator of Schiller. Count Vinzent Kicinski\r\ntranslated Victor Hugo; and Holawinski, Shakspeare. As successful\r\ndramatic writers are named, the counts Fredro, Korzeniowski, St.\r\nJaozowski, etc.\r\n\r\nOf an entirely national character are all the productions of Wladislas\r\nWoicicki, who devoted his life principally to the study of the\r\nantiquities of his country and its language. In 1838 he published an\r\ninteresting collection of old Polish proverbs[92]; several historical\r\ntales, scattered in Annuals; a greater work, entitled \"Domestic\r\nSketches:\" and another on Polish Woman;[93] all of them illustrations\r\nof Polish life and manners at certain times, and resting on an\r\nhistorical foundation. A rich collection of traditions and popular\r\nlegends was published by the same scholar in 1839.[94] This important\r\nnational feature has at last excited some attention among the Polish\r\nscholars. In 1838 a collection of the songs of the people in the\r\ncountry adjacent to the Bug was published.[95] Another appeared in the\r\nsame year, prepared by the poets Siemienski and Bielowski (Prague\r\n1838), with the title _Dumki_, i.e. Elegies,[96] being Polish\r\ntranslations of Malo-Russian popular songs. The great and simple\r\nbeauty of this poetry of the Kozaks surprised the literary world. But\r\nWoicicki and Zegota Pauli were the first who gave their attention to\r\nthe really Polish Lekhian popular songs, i.e. songs of the peasantry\r\nin Masavia and Podlachia, the grand duchy of Posen, the territory of\r\nCracow, etc. of which, until then, the existence was hardly known.[97]\r\n\r\nIt would almost seem as if the Russian government, in placing all the\r\nevidences of the mental activity of its Polish subjects under its\r\nstrictest guardianship, was ready to supply also the supposed want of\r\npopular poetry. There was recently published at Warsaw a collection of\r\nballads, sixty-nine in number, devoted to the praise of all the\r\nsovereigns of Russia, from Rurik to Alexander. These ballads are in\r\nthe popular tone, and were sold cheap.[98] What degree of popularity\r\nthey may have obtained, we are unable to say.[99]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On the origin of these tribes, which seem to have been\r\nkindred nations with the ancient Livonians, Esthonians, and\r\nBorussians, many hypotheses have been started, but the truth has not\r\nyet been sufficiently ascertained. It seems evident to us, that they\r\nare not of Slavic origin; although this has been maintained by many\r\nhistorians, who were misled by local circumstances. Even Schaffarik in\r\nhis Antiquities regards them as originally a Slavic race. See Parrot's\r\n_Versuch einer Entwickelung der Sprache, Abstammung, etc. der Liven,\r\nLetten, etc_.

According to Schaffarik in his Slav. Antiquities,\r\n_Lekh_, like _Czekh_, means a leader, a high officer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See pp. 36, 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See Bentkowski's _Hist. literatury Polsk_.

He states that\r\nAustrian Poland has 4,226,969 inhabitants; Prussian Poland, 2,584,124.\r\nThe population of the former consists however of a large proportion of\r\nRussniaks, and more especially of Jews; the latter has a similar\r\nproportion of German inhabitants.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Other private estimates make them not more than seven\r\nmillions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: We doubt whether any but Slavic organs would be able to\r\npronounce the name of the place, to which the college of Zamose was\r\nremoved.

That rhyme is not natural to\r\nthe Polish language, is evident from the ancient popular poetry of the\r\nother Slavic nations; which are all without rhyme. The author of the\r\nwork _Volkslieder der Polen_, assumes the absence of rhyme in some of\r\nthem as a proof of their antiquity. Of Slavic popular songs only those\r\nof the Malo-Russians or Ruthenians are rhymed; and none of these lay\r\nclaim to great antiquity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: This song, called _Boga Rodzica_, can be named a\r\nwar-song, only because the Poles used to sing it when advancing to\r\nbattle. It is rather a prayer to the Virgin, ending with a sixfold\r\nAmen. In a poetical respect it has no value. It is printed in\r\nBowring's _Specimens of the Polish Poets_, p. 12; together with the\r\nmusic, copied from a manuscript which is said to be from the twelfth\r\ncentury. No translation is added. It is remarkable that this hymn is\r\nstill sung, or at least was so in the year 1812, in the churches of\r\nthe places where St. Adalbert lived and died, viz. at Kola and Gnesen.\r\nNiemcewicz, who published it, states that he himself heard it at that\r\ntime at the latter place.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See Schaffarik's _Geschichte der Slav.

They\r\ncalled themselves Polish Brethren. Their principal school and printing\r\noffice was at Racow; several of their teachers were distinguished for\r\nlearning, their communities were wealthy and flourishing, and not a\r\nfew of the highest families of Poland belonged to them. The doctrines\r\nof the two exiled Italians, Lelio and Fausto Socini, uncle and nephew,\r\nfound among them only a conditional approbation; most of them were\r\nunwilling to receive Fausto, who developed his views more openly than\r\nhis uncle, into their community. Internal dissensions were the result,\r\nand the establishment of new and smaller congregations. A disturbance\r\namong the Students at Racow in 1638, gave to the Catholics and to the\r\nother Protestants a welcome pretext for persecuting them; in 1658\r\ntheir denomination was ultimately suppressed, and the choice left to\r\nthem between the adoption of the Roman Catholic religion or exile\r\nwithin three years. A part of them emigrated to Germany, where they\r\nwere soon merged in other Protestant denominations; others went to\r\nTransylvania, where the Unitarians, about fifty thousand in number,\r\nbelonged and still belong to the denominations acknowledged by the\r\nstate, and enjoy all civil rights. They have two high schools, at\r\nKlausenburg and at Thoarda; but are far from being distinguished for\r\nlearning. See Meusel's _Staatengeschicte_, p. 555.

It was composed of\r\nall the archbishops and bishops, the waiwodes and castellans, i.e. the\r\ntitled nobility, and the principal ministers of the king. It was thus\r\nin some measure the organ of the government and of the clergy, in\r\nopposition to the national representatives or the mass of the\r\nnobility. This body was not established until towards the close of the\r\nfifteenth century. Before 1466-70, every nobleman who chose, made his\r\npersonal appearance in the senate at the summons of the king; but\r\nCasimir, the son of Jagello, in his frequent want of money and men,\r\nrepeated these summons so often, that the nobility found personal\r\nappearance inconvenient, and selected in their provincial conventions\r\n_nuntii_, to represent the nation, or rather the nobility; without\r\nhowever giving up the right of personal attendance. The _nuntii_,\r\nwhose number was not fixed, were bound to appear, had the right to\r\ngrant or to refuse duties, and to act as the advisers of the king. In\r\n1505 the law was passed, that without their consent the constitution\r\ncould not be changed. At the diet in A.D. 1652 it occurred for the\r\nfirst time, that a single _nuntius_ opposed and annulled by his\r\n_liberum veto_ the united resolutions of the whole convention.

Let the question respecting Copernicus be decided\r\nas it may, Poland may doubtless lay claim to many other eminent\r\nnatural philosophers as her sons; e.g. Vitellio-Ciolek, who was the\r\nfirst in Europe to investigate the theory of light, in the beginning\r\nof the thirteenth century; Brudzewski, the teacher of Copernicus;\r\nMartinus of Olkusz, the proper author of the new or Gregorian\r\ncalendar, which was introduced sixty-four years after him, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: See Macherzynski's _Geschichte der Luteinischen Sprache\r\nin Polen_, Cracow 1833.

Of the present state of the Polish\r\npeasantry, the author of \"Poland under the dominion of Russia,\" (Bost.\r\n1834,) says: \"The Polish peasant might perhaps be about as free as my\r\ndog was in Warsaw; for I certainly should not have prevented the\r\nanimal from learning, had he been so inclined, some tricks by which he\r\ncould earn the reward of an extra bone.

It has only three faculties, viz. the philosophical,\r\ntheological, and juridical. For medicine it has only a preparatory\r\nschool, the course being finished at Vienna. Among the 65 medical\r\nstudents of 1832, there were 41 Jews. The university had in that year,\r\nin all, 1291 students. For the theological and juridical courses,\r\nwhich, according to law, comprise each four years, a previous\r\npreparation of two years spent in philosophical studies is required by\r\nthe government. Thus the regular course of an Austrian student lasts\r\nsix years.

Various Teutonic tribes--among them the\r\nBurgundians, the Suevi, Heruli, and Hermunduri--had before this taken\r\nup their temporary residence along the Baltic, between the Vistula and\r\nthe Elbe. In the great migration of the Asiatic-European nations,\r\nwhich for nearly two centuries kept in motion all Europe from the Icy\r\nOcean to the Atlantic, and extended even to the north of Africa, the\r\nwarlike German nations moved towards the south-west, and Slavic tribes\r\ntraversing the Danube and Vistula, in immense multitudes, took\r\npossession of the countries which they left. Those who came over the\r\nnorthern Vistula, settled along the coasts of the Baltic as far west\r\nas to the Elbe and Saale, and as far south as to the Erzgebirge (Ore\r\nMountains) on the borders of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThese Slavic tribes were called by the Germans, _Wenden_, Lat.\r\n_Venedi_, for which we prefer in English the form of _Vendes_, rather\r\nthan that of Wends. It appears indeed that this name was formerly\r\napplied by the Germans indiscriminately to all the Slavic nations with\r\nwhich they came in contact; for the name _Winden_, Eng. _Vindes_,\r\nwhich is still, as we have seen, the German appellation for the\r\nSlovenzi, or the Slavic inhabitants of Southern Germany, is evidently\r\nthe same in a slightly altered form. The name of _Wenden_, Vendes,\r\nbecame, however, in the course of time, a specific appellation for the\r\nnorthern German-Slavic tribes; of which, at the present day, only a\r\nfew meagre remnants are left. They were nevertheless once a powerful\r\nnation. Five independent branches must be distinguished among them.\r\n\r\nWe first name the _Obotrites_, the former inhabitants of the present\r\nduchies of Mecklenburg, and the adjacent country, west, north, and\r\nsouth. They were divided into the Obotrites proper, the Wagrians in\r\nHolstein, and the Polabæ and Linones on the banks of the Elbe and\r\nLeine; but were united under a common chief or king. They and their\r\neastern neighbours the Wiltzi, (Germ. _Wilzen_, Lat. _Veletabæ_,) with\r\nwhom they lived in perpetual warfare, were the most warlike and\r\npowerful among the Vendish tribes. The Wiltzi or Pomeranians lived\r\ninterspersed with the Kassubes, a Lekhish tribe, between the Oder and\r\nthe Vistula, and were subjugated by the Obotrites in A.D. 782. It was\r\nhowever only by the utmost exertions, that these latter could maintain\r\ntheir own independence against their western and southern neighbours,\r\nthe Germans. Conquered by Charlemagne, they regained their\r\nindependence under his successors, and centuries passed away in\r\nconstant and bloody conflicts and alternate fortunes. In the middle of\r\nthe twelfth century, however, they were completely subjugated by Henry\r\nthe Lion, duke of Saxony and Bavaria. He laid waste their whole\r\ncountry, destroyed most of the people, and compelled the few remaining\r\ninhabitants and their prince, to accept Christianity from his bloody\r\nhands. In A.D. 1167 he restored to this latter, whose name was\r\nPribislaus, a part of his kingdom, and gave his daughter Matilda in\r\nmarriage to the son of Pribislaus, who, a few years later, was made a\r\nprince of the empire, and was thus gained over to the German cause.\r\nHis descendants are the present dukes of Mecklenburg; and it is a\r\nmemorable fact, that these princes are at the present day the only\r\nsovereigns in Europe of the Slavic race. German priests and German\r\ncolonists introduced the German language; although we find that Bruno,\r\nthe chief missionary among the Obotrites, preached before them in\r\ntheir own language. The Slavic dialect spoken by them expired\r\ngradually; and probably without ever having been reduced to writing,\r\nexcept for the sake of curiosity when very near its extinction. The\r\nonly documents of it, which have come down to us, are a few incomplete\r\nvocabularies, compiled among the Polabæ and Linones, i.e. the\r\ninhabitants adjacent to the Elbe, in Slavic _Labe_, and to the Leine,\r\nin Slavic _Linac_.\r\n\r\nLong after the whole region was perfectly Germanized, a few towns in\r\nthe eastern corner of the present kingdom of Hanover, were still\r\nalmost exclusively inhabited by a people of Slavic race, who in the\r\nseventeenth century, and even to the middle of the eighteenth, had\r\npreserved in some measure their language and habits. But, since the\r\nGermans were strongly prejudiced against the Vendish name,--the\r\nnations of this race, especially those in the western part of the\r\nGerman territories, being despised as subjugated tribes, and inferior\r\nin general knowledge and information,--they gradually renounced their\r\nnational peculiarities. Towards the close of the seventeenth century,\r\nwhen Hennings, German pastor at Wustrow, took great pains to collect\r\namong them historical notices and a vocabulary of their language, he\r\nfound the youth already ignorant of the latter, and the old people\r\nalmost ashamed of knowing it, or at least afraid of being laughed at\r\nby their children. They took his inquiries, and those of other\r\nintelligent persons, in respect to their ancient language and\r\nusages, as intended to ridicule them, and denied at first any\r\nknowledge of those matters. We find, however, that preaching in the\r\nVendish language of this region was still continued for some time\r\nlater. Divine service was held in it for the last time at Wustrow, in\r\nthe year 1751. According to the vocabularies which Hennings and a few\r\nothers collected, their dialect, like that spoken in Lower Lusatia,\r\nwas nearly related to the Polish language; partaking however in some\r\npeculiarities of the Bohemian, and not without some of its own.[1]\r\n\r\nThe second great Vendish tribe, the Wiltzi or Pomeranians (Germ.\r\n_Wilzen_), also called Veletabæ, were, as we said above, subjugated\r\nin A.D. 782 by the Obotrites; and the country between the Oder and\r\nthe Vistula formed for more than a hundred and fifty years a part of\r\nthe great Vendish kingdom. They regained, however, even before the\r\nfinal dissolution of this latter in A.D. 1026, the partial\r\nindependence of their own dukes; who attached themselves to Germany,\r\nand afterwards, under the name of the dukes of Pomerania, became\r\nprinces of the empire. In the year 1124 the first Pomeranians were\r\nbaptized by Otho, bishop of Bamberg; and the place where this act was\r\nperformed, Ottosbrunnen (Otho's Well), which five hundred years ago\r\nwas encircled by four lime-trees, is still shown to the traveller. As\r\nthey received religion and instruction from Germany, the influence of\r\nthe German language can easily be accounted for. German colonists\r\naided in spreading it throughout the whole country. The last person\r\nwho understood the old Pomeranian language, is said to have died in\r\nthe year 1404. No trace of it remains, excepting only the names of\r\nplaces and persons, the Slavic origin of which can be recognized\r\nthroughout all north-eastern Germany by the terminations in _its,\r\nenz, ik_, or _ow_. In A.D. 1637 the line of the old Pomeranian dukes\r\nexpired, and the country fell to Brandenburg, with the exception of\r\nthat part which Sweden usurped at the peace of Westphalia. The island\r\nof Rügen, which till A.D. 1478 had its own native princes, belonged\r\nto this latter. It is the principal seat of German-Slavic\r\nantiquities. The ancient Rugians and their gods are mentioned by\r\nTacitus, and described by Saxo Grammaticus. The old chronicles and\r\nlegends, founded on still older traditions, speak of a large and\r\nflourishing city named Vineta on the small island Wollin, south-east\r\nof Rügen, once the principal seat of the western Slavic commerce,\r\nand, as Herder calls it, the Slavic Amsterdam. This city is said by\r\nsome to have been destroyed by the Danes; by others to have been\r\ningulfed in the sea by the sinking of the ground beneath it. Modern\r\ninquirers, however, have doubted whether it ever existed; and, hard\r\nas it is to renounce the many poetical associations attached to such\r\na subject,--so similar to those which fill the mind in thinking of\r\nPompeii and Herculaneum,--their objections have not yet been\r\nsatisfactorily refuted.\r\n\r\nThe third separate branch of the Vendish stem were the Ukrians, or\r\nBorder-Vendes, Germ. _Ukern,_ from _Ukraina_, border. They lived in\r\nthe territory which afterwards became the margravate of Brandenburg,\r\nand were divided into several tribes, as the Hevelli on the banks of\r\nthe Havel, the Retarians, etc. Their situation was such, that constant\r\nconflicts between them and the guardians or watch of the German\r\nfrontiers, the Saxon margraves on the other side of the Elbe, were\r\nunavoidable. These served gradually to extend the German _marches_ or\r\nfrontiers further and further, until in the year 1134 Albert the Bear,\r\ncount of Ascania, finally conquered the Vendes. The Slavic inhabitants\r\nof this region were cruelly and completely destroyed; the country was\r\nrepeopled by German and Dutch colonists, and given as a fief by the\r\nemperor to Albert the Bear, the first margrave of Brandenburg.\r\nBrandenburg was the German form for _Brannibor_, the most considerable\r\nof the Vendish cities, after which the country was called. The names\r\nof places, many of them altered in a similar manner, are indeed the\r\nonly weak traces of the Vendish language once spoken in this part of\r\nGermany. No tribe of the Vendes seems to have been so completely\r\nextinguished; the present inhabitants of Brandenburg being of as pure\r\na German origin, as those of any other part of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of only two Vendish tribes have preserved their\r\nlanguage; and even these, from powerful nations spread over the\r\nsurface of at least 4800 geographical square miles, have shrunk into\r\nthe comparatively small number of scarcely two hundred thousand\r\nindividuals, now inhabitants of Upper and Lower Lusatia. Nearly all of\r\nthem are peasants; for the higher classes, even if Slavic blood\r\nperhaps runs in their veins, are completely Germanized. These tribes\r\nare the Sorabians, Lat. _Sorabæ_, Germ. _Sorben_, in Lusatia, divided\r\ninto two different branches. They call themselves to this very day\r\n_Servians_, or rather (as also their brethren on the Danube) _Serbs_;\r\ntheir language, the _Serbish_ language. Although in fact two distinct\r\ntribes, and speaking different dialects, yet their early history\r\ncannot well be separated. After the dissolution of the great kingdom\r\nof Thuringia by the Francs and Saxons in the year 1528, the Sorabians,\r\nor Sorbæ, took possession of the countries left by the Hermunduri,\r\nviz. the territory between the Harz mountains, the Saale, and the\r\nErzgebirge, and extended their dominion in a northern direction to the\r\nseats of their brethren, the Ukrians, and towards the east as far as\r\nto the region in which their near relations, the Lekhes. about the\r\nsame time had settled. They made slaves of the few German inhabitants\r\nwhom they found scattered through this country; and according to their\r\nindustrious habits, began immediately after their arrival to cultivate\r\nthe soil, to build cities, and to trade in the productions of the\r\ncountry. Although not strictly a warlike people, they were able for\r\nseveral centuries to defend their frontiers against the frequent\r\nattacks of their German neighbours on the other side of the Saale, and\r\nto give them trouble in return. But they yielded before the arms of\r\nCharlemagne; and after a short interval of renewed independence, they\r\nwere completely subjugated and made tributary by Henry I. Their\r\ncountry, according to the German custom, was divided into _marches_,\r\nand populated with German settlers. These latter more especially\r\noccupied the towns, and built villages among the woods and mountains;\r\nwhilst the Vendes, chiefly addicted to agriculture, continued to\r\noccupy the plains. But even on the plains, there soon arose the\r\ncastles of German knights, their masters and oppressors; and the\r\nVendish population was by degrees reduced to the miserable condition\r\nof serfs.\r\n\r\nIn the year 968, the first attempt was made to convert them to\r\nChristianity, partly by the sword of the conqueror, partly by the\r\ninstruction of Christian missionaries. But more than one century\r\npassed away, before the Christian religion was fully introduced among\r\nthem. Benno, bishop of Meissen, who died in A.D. 1106, at the age of\r\nninety-six, acquired by his activity in the work of converting the\r\nVendes, the name of the apostle of the Slavi. The obstinate resistance\r\nwith which the Christian religion had been rejected by them, can\r\neasily be explained by the unjudicious, nay flagitious way, in which\r\nit was presented to them by the Germans; who came among them, the\r\nsword in one hand and the cross in the other; and exacted moreover\r\nfrom them the sacrifice of their language, their customs, their whole\r\nnationality in exchange. The naturally childlike and submissive\r\ndisposition of the Slavi rendered them in all other regions, as we\r\nhave seen, willing to receive the Christian doctrines, more especially\r\nwhen their superiors themselves acted as their apostles, as was in\r\nsome measure the case with the Russian Vladimir, Jagello in Lithuania,\r\netc.[2] But the mode described above, which was adopted by the German\r\nheroes, not only among the Vendes, but also some centuries later among\r\nthe old Borussians, could not but rouse all their feelings of pride\r\nand nationality to a decided resistance. Even when the Germans\r\nrefrained from force, their means of conversion were equally opposed\r\nto the spirit of Christianity. Bishop Otho of Bamberg, for instance,\r\nwas accustomed, when on his missionary travels, to have fifty or more\r\nwagons in his train loaded with cloth, victuals, and other supplies,\r\nin order to reward on the spot those who submitted to baptism.[3]\r\n\r\nBut the holy light of Christianity, even after the Vendish tribes had\r\nembraced its doctrines, did not clear up the darkness of their fate.\r\nThe whole humiliating relation between masters and serfs in Germany,\r\nwhich still degraded the last century, was unknown to the free ancient\r\nGermans, among whom only the prisoner of war was a slave; and is\r\nderived from the period of the submission of the Vendes. The Germans\r\nindeed seem to have considered them as an inferior race, and treated\r\nthem accordingly. The contempt with which the old historians speak of\r\nthem, is revolting to every liberal and unprejudiced mind, and can\r\nhardly be explained. For the Sorabians seem to have been at the time\r\nof their submission, superior on the whole to the Germans in respect\r\nto civilization; although in consequence of this contemptuous\r\ntreatment, they in the course of time fell far behind them. Despised\r\nand oppressed, they were kept for centuries in a state of ignorance\r\nand neglect; from which, it seems, they could only escape by\r\nrenouncing their Slavic peculiarities, and above all their language.\r\nThe use of this latter before courts of justice was in the fourteenth\r\ncentury forbidden by law throughout most of the country. In the\r\nbeginning of the same century, the Vendish language was still\r\nsometimes heard at Leipzig, but not afterwards. In the villages also\r\nit became wholly extinct fifty or a hundred years later; and only\r\nsingle words passed over into the German language. But this was not\r\nthe case with their usages and other national peculiarities; there are\r\nstill several tribes, nay the peasants of whole provinces in this part\r\nof Germany, in whom the Slavic origin can be distinctly traced.[4]\r\nTheir language however was driven into the remotest eastern corner of\r\ntheir former extensive territory; and is there, and only there, still\r\nto be heard. We speak of the province called Lusatia, situated between\r\nSaxony, Bohemia, Silesia, and Brandenburg, of which the greatest part\r\nis at present under the Prussian dominion, and the smallest but\r\nrichest portion under that of Saxony.\r\n\r\n_Lushitze_, Lusatia, Germ. _Lausitz_, signifies in Slavic, a low\r\nmarshland. This name was formerly applied only to the north-eastern\r\npart of this province, or Lower Lusatia, which is, or was at least at\r\nthe time of the Vendish settlement, a country of that description. At\r\na later period, the name was carried over very improperly to the\r\nsouth-western part, or Upper Lusatia, a beautiful and mountainous\r\nregion. Lusatia was given by Henry I, as a fief, to the margrave of\r\nMeissen. In the course of the following centuries, its two parts were\r\nrepeatedly separated and reunited, alternately under the dominion of\r\nthe last named margrave, of Poland, or of Bohemia, without however\r\nbelonging to the German empire. In the fourteenth century it was at\r\nlength incorporated with Bohemia, and remained so for nearly three\r\nhundred years. To this circumstance alone the partial preservation of\r\nthe Vendish language is to be ascribed. At the peace of Prague, A.D.\r\n1636, it was allotted to Saxony. At the congress of Vienna in 1815, it\r\nwas assigned, with the exception of the smaller half of Upper Lusatia,\r\nto Prussia, to which monarchy it still belongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Language of the Sorabians in Upper Lusatia_.\r\n\r\nThe cities of Bautzen, Zittau, Kamenz, Löbau, and their districts,\r\nform the Saxon part of Upper Lusatia. Of its 195,000 inhabitants,\r\nabout the fourth or fifth part still speak the Vendish language. In\r\nthe north-eastern part of Upper Lusatia, which belongs to Prussia,\r\nthere is about the same proportion of Vendish inhabitants. In both\r\nterritories the whole number of Vendes is about 100,000. Their\r\nlanguage is very nearly related to the Bohemian; where the Sorabians\r\nof Lower Lusatia and the Poles pronounce the letter _h_, the Upper\r\nLusatians and Bohemians give the sound of _g_. Both Lusatian dialects\r\nhave of course lost very many of their original peculiarities; thus\r\nboth have adopted the article from the German language.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation exhibited here, as every where, its favourable\r\ninfluence on the vernacular language. The bishops of Meissen, to\r\nwhose diocese Lusatia belonged, had indeed repeatedly admonished the\r\npriests and curates, to whose care the spiritual welfare of the poor\r\nSlavic Lusatians was intrusted, to learn the language of the people;\r\nbut no particular pains was taken; and the Romish clergy, who spoke of\r\nthe natives with the utmost contempt, were quite satisfied to hear the\r\npeople say _Amen_ and _Kyrie Eleison_ after their own Latin prayers.\r\nAs Lusatia lies near to the scene of Luther's earliest influence, the\r\nGospel was preached early to the Slavic inhabitants by some of his\r\nfollowers; and it had the natural consequence, that the Romish clergy\r\nalso began to give some attention to the vernacular language. In 1550,\r\nif not before, a Sorabian translation of the New Testament, the\r\nmanuscript and perhaps the autograph of which is preserved in the\r\nlibrary of Berlin, was completed; but it was never printed; probably\r\nbecause during the melancholy period of the \"Interim\" so called, which\r\ncommenced about that time, the energies of the Protestants were in\r\nsome measure paralyzed. Towards the end of the century Luther's\r\nsmaller Catechism, and several other religious and doctrinal tracts,\r\nwere translated from the German, mostly by clergymen, and introduced\r\ninto the schools; chiefly the village schools; for the cities were\r\nsteadily becoming more and more Germanized.\r\n\r\nThe neglect and decline of the Sorabian population was however always\r\npainfully felt by some patriotic individuals; and the very injudicious\r\nand tyrannic attempts of their German rulers, during the seventeenth\r\ncentury, to eradicate the language and supplant it by the German,\r\nfound in all places only a reluctant and forced submission. But the\r\neffect of appointing every where German magistrates and German pastors\r\nwas irresistible. The language was gradually forgotten by the rising\r\ngeneration; and hardly a Vendish book was printed during the first\r\nthree quarters of the seventeenth century. Indeed hardly any one\r\nknew how to write in a language, the orthography and grammar of\r\nwhich had not yet been subjected to any rules or principles.\r\n\r\nIn 1679 the Jesuit Jacob Ticinus, a native of Lusatia, in a little\r\nLatin pamphlet, advised his countrymen to adopt the rules of\r\northography current in the Bohemian language, so nearly related to\r\ntheir own.[5] But the Protestants among them, who constituted the\r\nprincipal part in number and respectability, rejected his advice; and\r\npreferred to adopt the rules established shortly afterwards by a\r\nGerman clergyman, Z.J. Bierling.[6] This was a system between the\r\nBohemian and the German, and is still observed. It was probably a\r\nsense of the approaching danger of an ultimate total extirpation of\r\ntheir language, that roused the slumbering Vendes again to some\r\nefforts. Parts of the Gospels were published towards the close of the\r\nsame century by Michael Frenzel; and in 1706 the whole New Testament\r\nappeared in a Vendish translation, conformed to Luther's German one.\r\n\r\nA translation of the whole Bible, made by several Protestant\r\nclergymen, was first published in 1729; and has been twice reprinted.\r\nA version for Catholics, by A. Swotlik, is extant in manuscript. A\r\nGerman hymn-book for the latter already existed in 1696; and in 1710\r\nthe Protestants were likewise supplied with one. In the former the\r\northography of Ticinus was followed; while the latter was printed\r\naccording to the system of Bierling. Thus this handful of people,\r\nsurrounded by German adversaries and underminers of their nationality,\r\nand who would have had hard work enough even if they had stood as one\r\nman in their own defence, were split into parties, even in things the\r\nmost indifferent; and thus made their own weakness still weaker.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants succeeded at last in the establishment of a seminary\r\nfor the education of Vendish ministers at Leipzig in 1716. Another was\r\ninstituted at Wittenberg, A.D. 1749. Their literature continued to be\r\nalmost exclusively of a religious kind; and consisted mostly of\r\ntranslations from the German. Another _Wendische Grammatica_ was\r\nwritten by G. Matthei, one of the translators of the Vendish Bible. A\r\ndictionary was prepared by Frencel.[7] Both works can now only be\r\nconsidered as curiosities. The latter proceeds upon the firm\r\nconviction, that the Slavi were originally Hebrews; and contrives to\r\npoint out in all the substantives or nouns of the Sorabian language a\r\ncertain degree of analogy. The only philological works, which will be\r\nof use to those who may wish to study this Slavic dialect in our day,\r\nis a short grammar by Seiler,[8] and a more modern one by J.P. Jordan.\r\nThe latter has adopted the system of orthography best adapted to the\r\nlanguage, viz. that introduced by Dobrovsky for the Bohemian.[9]\r\n\r\nThe Upper Lusatian dialect has acquired in this way a degree of\r\ncultivation, which of course, since most of those who speak and read\r\nit are of the common people, comparatively few are able to appreciate.\r\nIn religious hymns, there is no deficiency; and several cantos of\r\nKlopstock's Messiah have been translated into it by Möhn, in the\r\nmeasure of the original. In regard to the popular songs of the\r\nSorabians, a kind of poetry in which most Slavic nations are so rich,\r\nno pains was taken until recently to discover whether they had any or\r\nnot. But when on the publication of the remarkable Servian ballads,\r\nthe interest of the German public in this species of poetry became\r\nstrongly excited, the Saxon minister of state, baron Nostitz, himself\r\nan esteemed German poet, turned his attention particularly to this\r\nsubject; and succeeded in collecting several little songs full of that\r\nsweet, half pensive, half roguish feeling, which characterizes Slavic\r\npopular poetry in general. They were translated by him and\r\ncommunicated in manuscript to his friends: but whether they have ever\r\nbeen printed we are not informed.\r\n\r\nThis subject, however, was not long suffered to rest. Two societies\r\nhave been formed within the last twelve years, one at Breslau among\r\nthe students of the university natives of Lusatia; the other at\r\nBautzen among the scholars of the Gymnasium or High School; for the\r\npromotion of their native language and extending the knowledge of the\r\nantiquities of their country. Both these societies of the rising\r\ngeneration are favoured and assisted by gentlemen who take a general\r\ninterest in Slavic affairs. Another learned society, called \"The\r\nScientific society of Upper Lusatia,\" a union of scholars, had been\r\nfounded previously. In 1836, this society offered a premium for\r\ncollecting a certain number of genuine songs with their melodies,\r\nstill extant among the common people. The result has been a very\r\nvaluable collection. The first numbers appeared in 1841; and the whole\r\nwill form a standard work in the literature of popular poetry. It was\r\nan agreeable surprise to find, that even these isolated Slavic tribes,\r\nwho have been so long separated from other nations related to them,\r\nwere still in possession of a store of genuine Slavic ballads and\r\nancient melodies; while, on the other hand, many other ballads were\r\nfound among them, in which the influence of their German neighbours,\r\nor perhaps their own influence on the latter, could be distinctly\r\ntraced. Ballads and ditties, known to have been sung centuries before\r\nin Hessia or on the Rhine, rose suddenly from the night of an unheeded\r\nexistence: disguised, indeed, but easily recognized, in a Slavic\r\ndress, which bore indications of the same antiquity.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Language of the Sorabians in Lower Lusatia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLower Lusatia, or the north-eastern part of the Lusatian territory,\r\ntogether with the adjacent circle of Cotbus in Brandenburg, has about\r\nthe same number of Vendish inhabitants as the upper province. The\r\ndialect they speak has a strong affinity with the Polish; but is, like\r\nthat of their brethren in Upper Lusatia, corrupted by German\r\ninterpolations, and even in a still greater degree. It is obviously on\r\nthe decline; and we can only expect, that after the lapse of a hundred\r\nyears or less, no other vestige of it will be left than written or\r\nprinted documents.\r\n\r\nThe first book known to have been printed in this dialect, which is\r\nwritten according to a peculiar combination of the German letters, is\r\nMöller's Hymns, Catechism, and Liturgy, Bautzen 1574. Their present\r\nliterature, like that of Upper Lusatia, is confined to works for\r\nreligious instruction, grammars, and dictionaries. Of the former they\r\npossess no small number. They have also a complete version of the\r\nBible. The New Testament was translated for them as early as 1709, by\r\nFabricius, and printed together with the German text. It has been\r\nrepeatedly reprinted; and in the year 1798 a translation of the Old\r\nTestament by Fritze was added.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Herder, in his _Volkslieder_, communicated a popular\r\nballad from this dialect.

A _few_ would not\r\nhave satisfied the reader, and could not have done justice to poets,\r\nwho each for himself has a literary character of his own; and _many_\r\nwould have at least doubled the size of this volume. Shukovsky,\r\nPushkin, Mickewicz, Brodzinski, Krasinski, Kollar--each, as we said,\r\nhas an individual poetical character of his own, of which the reader\r\ncould have gathered no just idea without a whole series of their\r\nproductions; and these even then would have lost half their value in a\r\ntranslation. Yet they all have little of that peculiar _Slavic_\r\ncharacter, which belongs still in some degree to all Slavic nations;\r\nand which is so strikingly expressed in their POPULAR POETRY.\r\n\r\nOur remark respecting the loss of the principal charms which all\r\npoetical productions have to undergo, when clothed in a foreign dress,\r\napplies as well to popular poetry as to the works of literature, and\r\neven more. Indeed, if any kind of poetry must needs lose half its\r\nbeauties in a translation, the truth of the Latin saying, _Dulcius ex\r\nipsa fonte bibuntur aguæ_, will never be more readily acknowledged,\r\nthan in respect to the idiomatic peculiarities of popular ballads.\r\nThis holds good principally of merely lyric productions, the only kind\r\nof songs which are left to some of the Slavic tribes. They are grown\r\ninto the very bone and marrow of the language itself; and a congenial\r\nspirit can at the utmost imitate, but never satisfactorily translate\r\nthem. And yet they are the most essential features in the physiognomy\r\nof a people; or, as Görres expresses it, they are like pulse and\r\nbreath, the signs and the measure of the internal life. \"While the\r\ngreat _epic_ streams,\" as this ingenious writer justly says, \"reflect\r\nthe character of a whole wide-spread river-district, in time and\r\nhistory, these lyric effusions are the sources and fountains, which,\r\nwith their net-work of rills, water and drain the whole country; and,\r\nbringing to light the secrets of its inmost bowels, pour out into lays\r\nits warmest heart's blood.\" [1] We therefore give the specimens of\r\nSlavic popular poetry, which we here present to the reader, not merely\r\nas poems to be admired, but rather as characteristic features of the\r\nmental condition of the respective nations, and of their manner of\r\nthinking and feeling.\r\n\r\nThis is the age of utilitarianism. The Genius of poetry still lives\r\nindeed, for he is immortal; but the period of his living power is\r\ngone. His present dwelling is the study; the sphere of his operations\r\nthe parlour; the scene, where his exhibitions are displayed in a dress\r\nof morocco and gold, is the centre table of the rich and the genteel.\r\n_Popular poetry_,--we do not mean that divine gift, the dowry of a few\r\nblessed individuals; we mean that general productiveness, which\r\npervades the mass of men as it pervades Nature,--popular poetry, among\r\nall the nations of Europe, is only a dying plant. Here and there a\r\nlonely relic is discovered among the rocks, preserved by the\r\ninvigorating powers of the mountain air; or a few sickly plants, half\r\nwithered in their birth, grow up in some solitary valley, hidden from\r\nthe intrusive genius of modern improvement and civilization, who makes\r\nhis appearance with a brush in his hand, sweeping mercilessly away\r\neven the loveliest flowers which may be considered as impediments in\r\nhis path. Twenty years hence, and a trace will not be left, except the\r\ndried specimens which the _amateur_ lays between two sheets of paper,\r\nand the copies preserved in cabinets.\r\n\r\nAmong the nations of the Slavic race alone is the living flower still\r\nto be found, growing in its native luxuriance; but even here, only\r\namong the Servians and Dalmatians in its full blossom and beauty. For\r\ncenturies these treasures have been buried from the literary world.\r\nAddison, when he endeavored to vindicate his admiration of the ballad\r\nof \"Chevy-Chace,\" by the similarity of some of its passages with the\r\nepics of Virgil and Homer, had not the remotest idea, that the\r\nimmortal blind bard had found his true and most worthy successors\r\namong the likewise blind poets of his next Hyperborean neighbours. The\r\nmerit of having lifted at last the curtain from these scenes, belongs\r\nto Germany, chiefly to Herder. But only the few last years have\r\nallowed a more full and satisfactory view of them.\r\n\r\nIn laying before our readers a sketch of Slavic popular poetry, we\r\nmust renounce at once any attempt at chronological order. Slavic\r\npopular poetry has yet no history. Not that a considerable portion of\r\nit is not very ancient. Many mysterious sounds, even from the gray\r\nages of paganism, reach us, like the chimes of distant bells,\r\nunconnected and half lost in the air; while, of many other songs and\r\nlegends, the colouring reminds us strongly of their Asiatic home. But\r\nthe wonderful tales they convey, have mostly been only confined to\r\ntradition; especially there, where the fountain of poetry streamed;\r\nand streams still, in the richest profusion, namely, in Servia. Handed\r\ndown from generation to generation, each has impressed its mark upon\r\nthem. Tradition, that wonderful offspring of reality and imagination,\r\naffords no safer basis to the history of poetry, than to the history\r\nof nations themselves. To dig out of dust and rubbish a few fragments\r\nof manuscripts, which enable us to cast one glance into the night of\r\nthe past, has been reserved only for recent times. Future years will\r\nfurnish richer materials; and to the inquirer, who shall resume this\r\nsubject fifty years after us, it may be permitted to reduce them to\r\nhistorical order; while we must be contented to appreciate those,\r\nwhich are before our eyes, in a moral and poetical respect.\r\n\r\nThe Slavi, even when first mentioned in history, appear as a singing\r\nrace. Procopius, relating the surprise of a Slavic camp by the Greeks,\r\nstates that the former were not aware of the danger, having lulled\r\nthemselves to sleep by singing.[2] Karamzin, in his history of the\r\nRussian empire, narrates, on the authority of Byzantine writers, that\r\nthe Greeks being at war with the Avars, about A.D. 590, took prisoners\r\nthree Slavi, who were sent from the Baltic as ambassadors to the Khan\r\nof the Avars. These envoys carried, instead of weapons, a kind of\r\nguitar. They stated, that, having no iron in their country, they did\r\nnot know how to manage swords and spears; and described singing and\r\nplaying on the guitar as one of the principal occupations of their\r\npeaceful life.[3] The general prevalence of a musical ear and taste\r\namong all Slavic nations is indeed striking. \"Where a Slavic woman\r\nis,\" says Schaffarik, \"there is also song. House and yard, mountain\r\nand valley, meadow and forest, garden and vineyard, she fills them all\r\nwith the sounds of her voice. Often, after a wearisome day spent in\r\nheat and sweat, hunger and thirst, she animates, on her way home, the\r\nsilence of the evening twilight with her melodious songs. What\r\nspirit these popular songs breathe, the reader may learn from the\r\ncollections already published. Without encountering contradiction, we\r\nmay say, that among no other nation of Europe does natural poetry\r\nexist to such an extent, and in such purity, heartiness, and warmth of\r\nfeeling, as among the Slavi.\" [4]\r\n\r\nAlthough we recognize in the last sentence the voice of a Slavic\r\nenthusiast, we copy the whole of his remarks as perfectly true; and\r\nwould only add, that we do not consider \"heartiness and warmth of\r\nfeeling\" more a characteristic feature of Slavic than of Teutonic\r\npopular poetry. As for the purity and universality with which popular\r\npoetry is preserved among the Slavic nations, we strongly fear, that\r\nthe chief cause of these advantages lies in the barrenness of their\r\nliterature, and in the utter ignorance among the common people even of\r\nits elements.\r\n\r\nBefore we attempt to carry our reader more deeply into this subject,\r\nwe must ask him to divest himself as much as possible of his personal\r\nand national feelings, views, and prejudices, and to suffer himself to\r\nbe transported into a world foreign to his habitual course of ideas.\r\nHuman feelings, it is true, are the same every where; but we have more\r\nof the artificial and factitious in us than we are aware of. And in\r\nmany cases, we hold, that it is not the worst part of us; for we are\r\nfar from belonging to the class of advocates of mere nature. The\r\nreader, for instance, must not expect to find in all the immense\r\ntreasure of Slavic love-songs, adapted to a variety of situations, a\r\nsingle trace of _romance_, that beautiful blossom of Christianity\r\namong the Teutonic races. The love expressed in the Slavic songs is\r\nthe natural, heartfelt, overpowering sensation of the human breast, in\r\nall its different shades of tender affection and glowing sensuality;\r\nnever elevating but always natural, always unsophisticated, and much\r\ndeeper, much purer in the female heart, than in that of man. In their\r\nheroic songs, also, the reader must not expect to meet with the\r\nchivalry of the more western nations. Weak vestiges of this kind of\r\nexaltation, with a few exceptions, are to be found among those Slavic\r\nnations only, who, by frequent intercourse with other races, adopted\r\nin part their feelings. The gigantic heroism of the Slavic Woiwodes\r\nand Boyars is not the bravery of honour; it is the valour of manly\r\nstrength, the valour of the heroes of Homer. The Servian hero, Marko\r\nKralyewitch, was regarded by Goethe as the personification of\r\n_absolute_ heroism; but even Marko does not think it beneath him to\r\nflee, when he meets one stronger than himself. These are the dictates\r\nof nature, which only an artificial point of honour can overcome.\r\n\r\nBut, for the full enjoyment of Slavic popular poetry, we must exact\r\nstill more from the reader. He must not only divest himself of his\r\nhabitual ideas and views, but he must adopt foreign views and\r\nprejudices, in order to understand motives and actions; for the\r\nOriental races are far from being more in a state of pure nature than\r\nourselves. He will have to transport himself into a foreign clime,\r\nwhere the East and the West, the North and the South, blend in\r\nwonderful amalgamation. The suppleness of Asia and the energy of\r\nEurope, the passive fatalism of the Turk and the active religion of\r\nthe Christian, the revengeful spirit of the oppressed, and the\r\nchild-like resignation of him who cheerfully submits,--all these\r\nseeming contradictions find an expressive organ in Slavic popular\r\npoetry. Even in respect to his moral feelings, the reader will\r\nfrequently have to adopt a different standard of right and wrong.\r\nActions, which a Scotch ballad sometimes shields by a seductive\r\nexcuse,--as for instance in the case of \"Lady Barnard and Little\r\nMusgrave,\" where we become half reconciled to the violation of\r\ncongujal faith by the tragic end of the transgressors,--are detestable\r\ncrimes in the eyes of the Servian poet. On the other hand, he\r\nrelates with applause deeds of vengeance and violence, which all\r\nfeelings of Christianity teach us to condemn; and even atrocious\r\nbarbarities, which chill our blood, he narrates with perfect\r\ncomposure. This latter remark refers, in fact, chiefly to the ancient\r\nepics of the Servians. Much less of barbarism and wild revenge meets\r\nus in their modern productions, namely, the epic poems relating to the\r\nwar of deliverance in the beginning of the present century; although\r\ntheir oppressors had given them ample cause for a merciless\r\nretaliation. In the shorter and more lyric songs, of which a rich\r\ntreasure is the property of most Slavic nations, and in which their\r\ncommon descent is most strikingly manifested, there prevails a still\r\npurer morality, and the most tender feelings of the human breast are\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\nIt was on account of this decidedly exotic character of Slavic popular\r\npoetry, that, when the author of the present work first published a\r\nGerman version of the Servian popular songs, Goethe considered it as\r\nan advantage, that the work of translation had fallen into the hands\r\nof a lady. Only a female mind, the great poet thought, was capable of\r\nthe degree of accommodation requisite to clothe the \"barbarian poems\"\r\nin a dress, in which they could be relished by readers of nations\r\nforeign to their genius. Even the love-songs, although \"of the highest\r\nbeauty,\" he thought could only he enjoyed _en masse_. But this last\r\nremark applies in a certain measure to all popular poetry; for these\r\nlittle songs are like the warblings of the wood-birds; and a single\r\nvoice would do little justice to the whole. The monotonous chirping of\r\none little feathered singer is tedious or burdensome; while we enjoy\r\ntheir full concert as the sweetest music of nature. One swallow does\r\nnot make a summer. But the whole blissful sense of nature waking from\r\nher wintry sleep comes over you, when you hear the full, mixed chorus\r\nof the little songsters of the grove; and the monotonous cry of the\r\ncuckoo seems to belong just as much to the completeness of the\r\nconcert, as the enchanting solo of the nightingale.\r\n\r\nIf we attempt to characterize Slavic popular poetry as a whole, we\r\nhave chiefly to consider those shorter songs, which are common to all\r\nSlavic tribes, and which alone can be compared to the ballads of other\r\nnations. For, among the Slavi, only the Servians, including the\r\nDalmatians, Montenegrins, and Croats, who speak the same\r\nlanguage,--and indeed among all other modern nations they\r\nalone,--possess long popular epics, of a heroic character. What of\r\nthis species of poetry still survives among the other Slavic nations,\r\nor indeed in any other country of Europe, is only the echo of former\r\ntimes. The endlessly protracted \"Storie\" of the Italians are, indeed,\r\noften longer than the Servian heroic tales; but in no other respect do\r\nthey afford a point of comparison with them.\r\n\r\nThe Slavic popular songs have nothing, or very little, of the bold\r\ndramatic character which animates the Scotch, German, and Scandinavian\r\nballads. Even dialogues occur seldom, except in some narrative form;\r\nas for instance:\r\n\r\n  To her brother thus the lady answered;\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n  And the bonny maiden asked her mother.\r\n\r\nA division into epic and lyric ballads would also be difficult. A\r\nconsiderable portion, especially of the Russian and Servian songs,\r\nbegin with a few narrative verses; although the chief part of the song\r\nis purely lyric. These introductory verses are frequently allegorical;\r\nand if we do not always find a connection between them and the tale or\r\nsong which follows, it is because one singer borrows these\r\nintroductions from another, and adds an extemporaneous effusion of his\r\nown. These little allegories, however, frequently give a complete\r\npicture of the subject. They are, also, not always confined to the\r\nintroduction, but spun out through the whole poem. The following\r\nRussian elegy on the death of a murdered youth, may illustrate our\r\nremarks. We translate as literally as possible. The Russian original,\r\nlike the translation, has no rhymes,[5]\r\n\r\nELEGY.\r\n\r\n  O thou field! thou clean and level field!\r\n  O thou plain, so far and wide around!\r\n  Level field, dressed up with every thing,\r\n  Every thing; with sky-blue flowerets small,\r\n  Fresh green grass, and bushes thick with leaves;\r\n  But defaced by one thing, but by one!\r\n\r\n  For in thy very middle stands a broom,\r\n  On the broom a young gray eagle sits,\r\n  And he butchers wild a raven black,\r\n  Sucks the raven's heart-blood glowing hot,\r\n  Drenches with it, too, the moistened earth.\r\n  Ah, black raven, youth so good and brave!\r\n  Thy destroyer is the eagle gray.\r\n\r\n  Not a swallow 't is, that hovering clings,\r\n  Hovering clings to her warm little nest;\r\n  To the murdered son the mother clings.\r\n  And her tears fall like the rushing stream,\r\n  And his sister's like the flowing rill;\r\n  Like the dew the tears fall of his love:\r\n  When the sun shines, it dries up the dew.\r\n\r\n  P.\r\n\r\n\r\nServian songs begin also frequently with a series of questions, the\r\nanswers to which form mostly a very happy introduction to the tale.\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\n  What's so white upon yon verdant forest?\r\n  Is it snow, or is it swans assembled?\r\n  Were it snow, it surely had been melted;\r\n  Were it swans, long since they had departed.\r\n  Lo! it is not swans, it is not snow, there,\r\n  'T is the tents of Aga, Hassan Aga, etc.[6]\r\n\r\nIn Russian songs, on the other hand, a form of expression frequently\r\noccurs, which we venture to call a negative antithesis. It is less\r\nclear than the Servian, but just as peculiar. A preceding question\r\nseems to be frequently supposed; as we have also seen in the piece\r\nadduced above, \"It is not a swallow,\" the poet says, \"that clings to\r\nher nest; it is a mother who clings to her son.\" In other songs we\r\nhear;\r\n\r\n  Not a _falcon_ floateth through the air,\r\n  Strays a _youth_ along the river's brim, etc.\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n  Not a cuckoo in the forest cool doth sing,\r\n  Not in the gardens sings a nightingale;\r\n  In the prison dark a brave youth sighs,\r\n  He sighs and pours out many parting tears.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of standing epithets, characteristic more or less of all\r\npopular poetry, is particularly observable among the Slavic nations.\r\nThe translator will be troubled to find corresponding terms; but\r\nwhatever he may select, it is essential always to employ the same;\r\nfor instance, he must not translate the far-extended idea of _bjeloi_,\r\nwhite, alternately by _white, bright, snowy, fair_. In Slavic, not\r\nonly things really white are called so, but every thing _laudable_ and\r\n_beautiful_ is called white; as, the _white_ God, i.e. the _good_ God;\r\nthe _white_ Tzar, i.e., the monarch of _white_, or great and powerful,\r\nRussia. In most cases the poet himself no longer thinks of the\r\nsignification and original meaning of the word. Yards, walls, bodies,\r\nbreasts, hands, etc. are invariably _white_; even the breast and the\r\nhand of the tawny Moor. The sea is seldom mentioned without the\r\nepithet _blue_; Russian heroes have _black_ hair, but the head of the\r\nServian hero is called _Rusja glava_, fair-haired, with a reddish\r\nshade. Russian youths, together with their steeds, are invariably\r\n_dobroe_, that is, good or brave; the heart is in the poetry of the\r\nsame nation _retivoe_, cheerful, rash, light. The sun is in Servian\r\n_yarko_, bright; in Russian _krasnoi_, which signifies fair and red.\r\nDoves are in both languages _gray_. How much the poets are accustomed\r\nto these epithets, and how heedlessly they use them, appears from a\r\nServian tale, called \"Haykuna's Wedding,\" a charming poem, and even\r\nmuch more elaborated than is common, where the breasts of a beautiful\r\ngirl are compared to two gray doves. To remind our readers of the\r\nfather of popular poetry, Homer, and of the like use by him of\r\nstereotype epithets, is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe Slavic popular ballads, like the Spanish, very seldom lay any\r\nclaim to completeness. They do not pretend to give you a whole story,\r\nbut only a _scene_. They are, for the most part, little pictures of\r\nisolated situations, from which it is left to the imagination of the\r\nhearers to infer the whole. The narrative part is almost always\r\ndescriptive, and, as such, eminently _plastic_. If the picture\r\nrepresented has not the dramatic vivacity of the ballads of the\r\nTeutonic nations, it has the distinctness, the prominent forms, and\r\noften the perfection of the best executed bas-reliefs of the ancients.\r\nLike these, the Slavic poems seldom represent wild passions or\r\ncomplicated actions; but, by preference, scenes of rest, and mostly\r\nscenes of domestic grief or joy. When we look at the celebrated Greek\r\nbas-relief, which represents an affianced maiden the evening before\r\nher wedding, weeping, or bashfully hiding her fair face, while a\r\nservant girl washes her feet,[7] we cannot help being impressed with\r\njust the same feelings, which seize us when we hear or read one of the\r\nnumerous Slavic songs devoted to similar scenes. To illustrate our\r\nremarks, and to make our readers understand exactly what we call the\r\n_plastic_ character of Slavic popular songs, we insert here the\r\nfollowing Servian love-scene. We add, that it was one of Goethe's\r\nfavourites, worthy, in his opinion, to be compared with the\r\nCanticles.[8] There is a melody in the language of this song, not to\r\nbe imitated in any translation. We confess that Frederic Schlegel's\r\ndefinition of architecture, \"frozen music,\" occurs to us when we read\r\nit in the original.\r\n\r\nJOVO AND MARIA.\r\n\r\n  'Cross the field a breeze it bore the roses,\r\n  Bore them far into the tent of Jovo;\r\n  In the tent were Jovo and Maria,\r\n  Jovo writing and Maria broidering.\r\n  Used has Jovo all his ink and paper,\r\n  Used Maria all her burnished gold-thread.\r\n  Thus accosted Jovo then Maria;\r\n  \"O sweet love, my dearest soul, Maria,\r\n  Tell me, is my soul then dear unto thee?\r\n  Or my hand find'st thou it hard to rest on?\"\r\n  Then with gentle voice replied Maria;\r\n  \"O, in faith, my heart and soul, my Jovo,\r\n  Dearer is to me thy soul, O dearest,\r\n  Than my brothers, all the four together.\r\n  Softer is thy hand to me to rest on,\r\n  Than four cushions, softest of the soft ones.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThe high antiquity of Slavic popular poetry is manifest among other\r\nthings, in the frequent mythological features which occur. In the\r\nballads of the Teutonic nations, we recollect very few instances of\r\ntalking animals. As to those which talk in nursery tales, we are\r\nalways sure to discover in them enchanted princes or princesses. In\r\none Scotch ballad, \"The Gray Goshawk,\" a horse speaks; and, in a few\r\nother instances, falcons and nightingales. In Spanish popular poetry\r\nwe do not meet with a single similar example. In the songs of all the\r\nSlavic nations, conversing, thinking, sympathizing animals are very\r\ncommon. No one wonders at it. The giant Tugarin Dragonson's steed\r\nwarns him of every danger. The great hero Marko's horse even weeps,\r\nwhen he feels that the death of his master approaches. Nay, life is\r\nbreathed even into inanimate objects by the imagination of Slavic\r\ngirls and youths. A Servian youth contracts a regular league of\r\nfriendship and brotherhood with a bramble-bush, in order to induce it\r\nto catch his coy love's clothes, when she flees before his kisses.\r\nEven the stars and planets sympathize with human beings, and live in\r\nconstant intercourse with them and their affairs. Stars become\r\nmessengers; a proud maiden boasts to be more beautiful than the sun;\r\nthe sun takes it ill, and is advised to burn her coal-black in\r\nrevenge. The moon hides herself in the clouds when the great Tzar\r\ndies. One of the most interesting Servian tale, called \"The Heritage,\"\r\nis the fruit of the moon and the morning star's gossiping with each\r\nother. It begins thus:\r\n\r\n  To the morning star the moon spake chiding;\r\n  \"Morning star, say where hast thou been wandering?\r\n  Where hast thou been wandering and where lingering,\r\n  Where hast thou three full white days been lingering?\"\r\n\r\n  To the moon the morning star has answered;\r\n  \"I've been wandering, I've three days been lingering,\r\n  O'er the white walls of the fortress Belgrade,\r\n  Gazing there on strange events and wonders.\"\r\n\r\nThe events which the star had witnessed, it now proceeds to relate to\r\nthe moon; and these make the subject of this beautiful tale.\r\n\r\nAfter having touched upon these general features, did our limits\r\npermit, we should speak more at large of those mythological beings of\r\na more distinct character, which belong to the individual Slavic\r\nraces; for example, the Vila of the Servians, the Russalki of the\r\nMalo-Russians, and the like; at least so far as this belief is\r\ninterwoven in their poetry, the only respect in which it concerns us\r\nhere. But we must confine ourselves to a few brief remarks.\r\n\r\nThe strong and deeply-rooted superstitions of the Slavic nations are\r\npartly manifest in their songs and tales; these are full of foreboding\r\ndreams, and good or bad omens; witchcraft of various kinds is\r\npractised; and a certain oriental fatalism seems to direct will and\r\ndestiny. The connection with the other world appears nevertheless much\r\nlooser, than is the case with the Teutonic nations. There is no trace\r\nof spirits in Russian ballads; although spectres appear occasionally\r\nin Russian nursery tales. In Servian, Bohemian, and Slovakian songs,\r\nit occurs frequently, that the voices of the dead sound from their\r\ngraves; and thus a kind of soothing intercourse is kept up between the\r\nliving and the departed. The superstition of a certain species of\r\nblood-sucking spectres, known to the novel reading world under the\r\nname of _vampyres_, a superstition retained chiefly in Dalmatia,\r\nbelongs also here. In modern Greek, such a spectre is called\r\n_Brukolacas_ in Servian _Wukodlak_. We do not however recollect the\r\nappearance of a vampyre, in any genuine production of modern Greek or\r\nServian poetry. It seems as if the sound sense of the common people\r\nhad taught them, that this superstition is too shocking, too\r\ndisgusting, to be admitted into poetry; while the oversated palates of\r\nthe fashionable reading world crave the strongest and most stimulating\r\nfood, and can only be satisfied by the most powerful excitement.\r\n\r\nIn the whole series of Slavic ballads and songs, which lie before our\r\neyes, we meet with only one instance of the return of a deceased\r\nperson to this world, in the like gloomy and mysterious way, in which\r\nthe Christian nations of the North and West are wont to represent such\r\nan event. This is in the beautiful Servian tale, \"Jelitza[10] and her\r\nBrothers.\" As it is too long to be inserted here entire, we must be\r\nsatisfied with a sketch of it. Jelitza, the beloved sister of nine\r\nbrothers, is married to a Ban on the other side of the sea. She\r\ndeparts reluctantly, and is consoled only by the promise of her\r\nbrothers to visit her frequently. But \"the plague of the Lord\"\r\ndestroys them all; and Jelitza, unvisited and apparently neglected by\r\nher brothers, pines away and sighs so bitterly from morning to\r\nevening, that the Lord in heaven takes pity on her. He summons two of\r\nhis angels before him;\r\n\r\n  \"Hasten down to earth, ye my two angels,\r\n  To the white grave where Jován lies buried,\r\n  The lad Jován, Jelitza's youngest brother;\r\n  Into him, my angels, breathe your spirit,\r\n\r\n  \"Make for him a horse of his white grave-stone,\r\n  Knead a loaf from the black mould beneath him,\r\n  And the presents cut out from his grave-shroud;\r\n  Thus equip him for his promised visit.\"\r\n\r\nThe angels do as they are bidden. Jelitza receives her brother with\r\ndelight, and asks of him a thousand questions, to which he gives\r\nevasive answers. After three days are past, he must away; but she\r\ninsists on accompanying him home. Nothing can deter her. When they\r\ncome to the church-yard, the lad Jován's home, he leaves her under a\r\npretext and goes back into his grave. She waits long, and at last\r\nfollows him. When she sees the nine fresh graves, a painful\r\npresentiment seizes her. She hurries to the house of her mother. When\r\nshe knocks at the door, the aged mother, half distracted, thinks it is\r\n\"the plague of the Lord,\" which, after having carried off her nine\r\nsons, comes for her. The mother and daughter die in each other's\r\narms.[11]\r\n\r\nThis simple and affecting tale affords, then, the only instance, in\r\nSlavic popular poetry, of a regular apparition; but even here that\r\napparition has, as our readers have seen, a character very different\r\nfrom that of a Scotch or German ghost. The same ballad exists also in\r\nmodern Greek; although in a shape perhaps not equal in power and\r\nbeauty to the Servian.[12]\r\n\r\nBut the very circumstance that its subject is so isolated among the\r\nSlavic nations, who are so ready to seize other poetical ideas and to\r\nmould them in various ways, leads us to believe, that the Servian poet\r\nmust have heard somehow or other the Greek ballad, or a similar one;\r\nand that the subject of the Servian ballad, although this is familiar\r\nto all classes, was originally a stranger in Servia. Nowhere indeed,\r\nin the whole range of Slavic popular poetry, do we meet with that\r\nmysterious gloom, with those enigmatical contradictions, which are\r\npeculiar to the world of spirits of the Teutonic North; and which we\r\nthink find their best explanation in the antithesis between the\r\nprinciples of Christianity, and the ruins of paganism on which it was\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that, wherever Christianity has been carried, similar\r\ncontradictions must necessarily have taken place: but the mind of the\r\nSlavic nations, so far as it is manifest in their poetry, seems never\r\nto have been perplexed by these contradictions. History shows, that\r\nthe Slavic nations, with the exception of those tribes who were\r\nexcited to headstrong opposition by the cruelty and imprudence of\r\ntheir German converters, received Christianity with childlike\r\nsubmission; in most cases principally because their superiors adopted\r\nit.[13] Vladimir the Great, to whom the Gospel and the Koran were\r\noffered at the same time, was long undecided which to choose; and was\r\nat last induced to embrace the former, because \"his Russians could not\r\nlive without the pleasure of drinking.\"[14] The wooden idols, it is\r\ntrue, were solemnly destroyed; but numerous fragments of their altars\r\nwere suffered to remain undisturbed at the foot of the cross; and the\r\npassion-flower grew up in the midst of the wild broom, the branches\r\nof which, tied together, the Tshuvash considers, even at the present\r\nday, as his tutelary spirit or Erich[15]. No struggle seems ever to\r\nhave taken place, to reconcile these contradictory elements; while the\r\nmore philosophical spirit of the Teutonic nations, and their genius\r\nfor meditation and reflection, could not be so easily satisfied. The\r\ncharacter of the Teutonic world of spirits is the reflex of this\r\nstruggle. The foggy veil which covers their forms, the mysterious\r\nriddles in which their existence is wrapped, the anxious pensiveness\r\nwhich forms a part of their character, all are the results of these\r\nfruitless and mostly unconscious endeavours to amalgamate opposing\r\nelements. We cannot approach the region of their mysterious existence\r\nwithout an awful shuddering; while the few fairies, which Slavic\r\npoetry and superstition present us, strike us by the distinctness and\r\nfreshness of their forms, and give us the unmingled impression either\r\nof the ludicrous or of the wild and fantastic.\r\n\r\nIt remains to speak of the moral character of Slavic popular poetry.\r\nIf, in respect to its decency, we may judge from the printed\r\ncollections, we must be struck with the purity of manners among the\r\nSlavic nations, and the unpollutedness of their imagination. Hacquet,\r\nspeaking of the Slovenzi or Vindes, the Slavic inhabitants of\r\nCarniola, states, that the songs with which they accompany their\r\ndances are often indecent[16]. But there is little dependence to be\r\nplaced on judgments of this description. Sometimes expressions and\r\nideas are rashly called indecent, which only differ from the\r\nconventional forms of decency without really violating its laws.\r\nHacquet moreover only half understood those songs of the Slovenzi. We\r\nwill at least not condemn them without having seen them. Among the\r\nRussian songs, there are some of a certain wanton and equivocal\r\ncharacter, displaying with perfect _naïveté_ a scarcely half-veiled\r\nsensuality. The boldness, with which these songs are sung in chorus by\r\nyoung peasant women, has often excited the astonishment of foreigners.\r\nThe number of ballads of this description, however, so far as we are\r\ninformed, is not considerable; and the character of Russian\r\nlove-ballads in general is pure and chaste. As for the Servians, they\r\nhave in fact a great multitude of songs of a very marked levity and\r\nfrivolity; and Goethe, when these first appeared in the German version\r\nof Gerhardt, could not help finding it remarkable, that two nations,\r\none half-barbarous, the other the most practised of all, (_die\r\ndurchgeübteste_, meaning the French,) should meet together on the step\r\nof frivolous lyric poetry[17]. But these Servian songs are pure in\r\ncomparison with many Grub-Street ballads and German _Zotenlieder_. The\r\nspirit of roguery and joviality, which prevails in them all, proves\r\nthat they are more the overflowings of wild and unrestrained youth,\r\nthan the fruits of dissoluteness of manners. They are often coarse,\r\nbut never vulgar; they are indelicate, but they are not impudent. At\r\nany rate, we never meet in them that confounding of virtuous and\r\nvicious feelings, which has so often struck us painfully even in the\r\nbest Scotch and German ballads. We refer the reader here to our\r\nprevious remarks on the measure of right and wrong, to be applied in\r\nour judgment of nations foreign to us in habits and pursuits. The\r\nheroes of the Servian epics are always represented as virtuous, often\r\nto harshness. Marko Kralyewitch is always ready to punish young women\r\nfor any trespass against female modesty, by severing their heads from\r\ntheir shoulders; and even to his own bride, when he thinks her too\r\nobliging towards himself, he applies the most ignominious names, and\r\nthreatens her with the sword.\r\n\r\nLove and heroism, the principal subjects of all poetry, are also the\r\nmost popular among the Slavi. But one of the peculiarities of their\r\npoetry is, that these two subjects are kept apart more than among\r\nother nations. While in the exploits of the Spanish heroes, which the\r\npopular Romances celebrate, love is so interwoven with heroism, and\r\nheroism with love, that we are not able to separate this two-fold\r\nexaltation of a generous mind, love is almost excluded from the heroic\r\npoems of the Slavi; or, at least, admitted only about in the same\r\ndegree as in the epics of the ancients. It is seldom, if ever, the\r\nmotive of the hero's actions. We need then add nothing more, to\r\ndescribe the character of Slavic heroism. It is never animated by\r\nromantic _love_; although sometimes, in the more modern epics of the\r\nServians, by romantic _honour_. In one of the modern Servian tales,\r\nperhaps about a century old, which describes a duel between a\r\nDalmatian Servian and a Turk, a scene of the most perfect chivalry\r\noccurs. The young Dalmatian captain, Vuk Jerinitch, having just\r\nreached manhood, inquires of the older captains, which of the Turks\r\nhad most injured their country during the last invasion, while he was\r\na child. The old captains name to him Zukan, the Turkish standard\r\nbearer. Vuk consequently challenges him, proposing at the same time,\r\nin true Oriental character, that, himself having a beautiful sister\r\nand the Turk a wife of equal beauty, both shall belong to the victor.\r\nZukan of course accepts the challenge. Their meeting is in the best\r\nchivalric style; they demand of each other no pledge or oath of faith,\r\nbut meet in Vuk's tent with perfect confidence; they embrace and kiss\r\neach other, and make friendly inquiries after each other's health. The\r\nfirst hour of their meeting flies away in conviviality, and in\r\nadmiration of the ladies. At last the desire to gain the Christian\r\ngirl induces the Turk to interrupt their drinking. But, before they\r\nbegin the fight, \"they kiss each other on the cheeks, and forgive each\r\nother mutually their blood and death.\" This scene indeed has a\r\ndecidedly Oriental costume; but the feelings, from which it results,\r\nare produced by as much of romantic exaltation as any Spanish romance\r\ncould exhibit.\r\n\r\nGoetze, in the introduction to his German translation of Russian\r\npopular ballads, observes: \"In the Russian love songs we meet with\r\nmore _softness_ of feeling than romantic delicacy.\" We do not perceive\r\nany marked difference in that respect, between the character of\r\nRussian and of other Slavic erotic songs; and apply therefore his\r\nremark to the whole race. _Romantic_ delicacy we must not, in fact,\r\nexpect to find; but often all the natural delicacy of warm, tender,\r\ndevoted love; all the freshness of youthful, unsophisticated feelings;\r\nall the burning passion of Spanish love, with the same strong tincture\r\nof sensuality; though seldom, very seldom, that depth, that\r\ninfiniteness of the same feeling, so affectingly expressed in more\r\nthan one popular ballad of the Scandinavians, Germans, and\r\nBritish,--that love which reaches far beyond the grave, and chains\r\nsouls to each other even in different worlds. Russian lovers, who are\r\ncompelled by circumstances to leave their mistresses, give frequently\r\nthe following or similar advice:\r\n\r\n  Weep not, weep not, O sweet maid!\r\n  Choose, O choose another love!\r\n  _Is he better, thou'll forget me_;\r\n  Is he worse, thou'lt think of me,\r\n  Think of me, sweet soul, and weep!\r\n\r\nLove, among the Slavi, more than among any other Christian race, seems\r\nto be a _dream of youth_. Among unmarried persons of both sexes, free\r\nand easy intercourse is kept up. But nothing can favour less a free\r\nand lasting affection, than the national mode of contracting\r\nmarriages. Among those Slavic nations, who have lived long in\r\nconnection with the Teutonic races, the national manners have of\r\ncourse partly changed in this respect, as in others; especially among\r\nthe higher classes. But among the Servians, the old Asiatic custom,\r\naccording to which a marriage is agreed on by the parents of the\r\nparties, often without these knowing each other, is kept up in its\r\nfullest extent; and, even among all Slavic nations, strong traces of\r\nthis custom are still left. Affianced Slavic girls often do not see\r\ntheir intended husbands before the wedding-day. Thus a girl, even in\r\nattaching herself to a youth, must early familiarize herself with the\r\nthought, that the time may come when she will have to take back her\r\nheart at her parent's bidding. Illegitimate love is rare; and is\r\nconsidered as the highest crime. Of the Russian popular songs, no\r\nsmall portion describe lovers taking leave of each other, because the\r\nyouth or the maid must marry another; in another considerable portion,\r\nyoung married women are represented lamenting their miserable fate.\r\nThe following popular ballad will afford the reader a characteristic\r\nspecimen of the whole tenderness of such a Russian parting scene.\r\n\r\nTHE FAREWELL.\r\n\r\n  Brightly shining sank the waning moon,\r\n  And the sun all beautiful arose;\r\n\r\n  Not a falcon floated through the air,\r\n  Strayed a youth along the river's brim.\r\n  Slowly strayed he on and dreamingly,\r\n  Sighing looked unto the garden green,\r\n  Heart all filled with sorrow mused he so:\r\n  \"All the little birds are now awake,\r\n  All, embracing with their little wings,\r\n  Greeting, all have sung their morning songs.\r\n  But, alas! that sweetest doveling mine,\r\n  She who was my youth's first dawning love,\r\n  In her chamber slumbers fast and deep.\r\n  Ah! not even her friend is in her dreams,\r\n  Ah! no thought of me bedims her soul,\r\n  While my heart is torn with wildest grief,\r\n  That she comes to meet me here no more.\"\r\n\r\n  Stepped the maiden from her chamber then;\r\n  Wet, O! wet with tears her lovely face,\r\n  All with sadness dimmed her eyes so clear,\r\n  Feebly drooping hung her snowy arms.\r\n  'T was no arrow that had pierced her heart,\r\n  'T was no adder that had stung her so;\r\n  Weeping, thus the lovely maid began:\r\n  \"Fare thee well, beloved, fare thee well,\r\n  Dearest soul, thy father's dearest son!\r\n  I have been betrothed since yesterday;\r\n  Come, to-morrow, troops of wedding-guests;\r\n  To the altar, I, perforce, must go!\r\n  I shall be another's then; and yet\r\n  Thine, thine only, thine alone till death.\"\r\n\r\n  P.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the warm and tender hearts of the Slavic women, nevertheless, find\r\nmeans to satisfy that natural want of the female breast, to pour out\r\non certain objects the whole blessing of love. _Family_ connections\r\nare among no other race regarded as so holy, the ties of relationship\r\nare nowhere so cherished, as among the Slavi. Maternal tenderness is\r\nthe subject of very many songs; and is set by comparisons in the most\r\nshining light. In the Russian ballad above adduced,[19] we have seen\r\nhow slightly the poet thinks of the love of the wife; her tears are\r\ndried up by the sun, like the morning dew; while the mother's tears\r\ngush out incessantly like the waters of the mountain stream. In a\r\nServian ballad, a youth wounds his hand. The Vila, a malicious\r\nmountain-nymph, offers to cure him. But she exacts a high price,--from\r\nhis mother, her right hand; from his sister, her hair; and from his\r\nwife, her necklace of pearls. The mother willingly gives her right\r\nhand, and the sister her hair, but the wife refuses the necklace. The\r\nlove of a mother is often described by the image of swallows, clinging\r\nto their own warm nest; or of tender doves, bereft of their young\r\nones. The rights of a mother are respected with true filial piety,\r\neven by the barbarian hero Marko, who never fails to pay his aged\r\nmother filial respect.\r\n\r\nMore remarkable, however, in Slavic popular poetry, is the peculiar\r\nrelation of the sister to the brother. This remark holds especially\r\ngood of Servia. Sisters cling to their brothers with a peculiar warmth\r\nof feeling. These are their natural protectors, their supporters. They\r\nswear by the head of their brothers. To have no brother is a\r\nmisfortune, almost a disgrace. A mourning female is represented in all\r\nSlavic poetry under the constant image of a cuckoo; and the cuckoo,\r\naccording to the Servian legend, was a sister who had lost her\r\nbrother. Numerous little songs illustrate the great importance which\r\na Servian girl attaches to the possession of a brother. Those who have\r\nnone, think even of artificial means for procuring one. This is\r\nexhibited in a pretty little ballad, where two sisters, who have no\r\nbrother, make one out of white and pink silk wound around a stick of\r\nbox-wood; and, after putting in two brilliant black stones as eyes,\r\ntwo leeches as eyebrows, and two rows of pearls as teeth, put honey in\r\nhis mouth, and entreat him \"to eat and to speak.\" In another ballad,\r\nof a more serious description, \"George's young wife\" loses at once in\r\nbattle her husband, her brideman (_paranymphos_, in Servia a female's\r\nlegitimate friend through life), and her brother. The gradations of\r\nthe poetess in her description of the widow's mourning are very\r\ncharacteristic, and give no high idea of conjugal attachments in\r\nServia.\r\n\r\n  For her husband, she has cut her hair;\r\n  For her brideman she has torn her face;\r\n  For her brother she has plucked her eyes out.\r\n  Hair she cut, her hair will grow again;\r\n  Face she tore, her face will heal again;\r\n  But the eyes, they'll never heal again,\r\n  Nor the heart, which bleedeth for the brother.\r\n\r\nAfter having thus attempted to point out to the reader what we\r\nconsider as the _general_ characteristic features of Slavic popular\r\npoetry, we proceed to add a few remarks on the _distinguishing_ traits\r\nof the different nations of the Slavic race individually, so far as\r\nour limits permit.\r\n\r\nAnd here it is among the nations of the EASTERN STEM that we must look\r\nfor our principal harvest. We follow the same order as in the former\r\nparts of this work.\r\n\r\nThe RUSSIANS have very few ballads of high antiquity; and, even in\r\nthis small number, hardly any one has reference to the heroic prose\r\ntales, which are the delight of Russian nurseries.\r\n\r\nThe Russians have indeed nursery tales (_skazki_) of all descriptions;\r\nand we have often heard, that, during the first decennium of the\r\npresent century, still many an old-fashioned country squire, many a\r\ncountry gentlewoman brought up among her female slaves like an\r\noriental princess, were in the habit of having themselves lulled to\r\nsleep by them. They are almost invariably told in the same words; and\r\nas much as possible with the same intonation of voice. One\r\n_Skazkochnik_, or _Skazkochnitza_, adopts this manner from another.\r\nThe traditions of Vladimir and his giant heroes are the favourite, but\r\nnot the exclusive subjects of these tales. They are also printed and\r\nsold separately; with a coarse wood-cut on the upper part of every\r\npage, representing the scene described, and the back of the page\r\nempty. We are told that they are mostly got up by \"Deacons,\" a class\r\nof the lower clergy, in their leisure hours. It is probable that these\r\ntraditions formerly existed also in the shape of popular ballads; but\r\nno trace has been left of them. In the beginning of this century the\r\nwork of Kirscha Danilof, of which we have spoken in our view of\r\nRussian literature,[20] was first published, containing the ancient\r\ntraditions; written in the national prosodic measure, but without any\r\npoetical spirit; replete with anachronisms and absurdities, without\r\nthe _naiveté_ which can alone make these latter tolerable. They were,\r\nbesides, full of interpolations; and were evidently the productions of\r\na man from the people who had acquired half an education. For this\r\nreason they have never gained popularity in this shape.\r\n\r\nThe more modern heroic ballads of the Russians are of a remarkably\r\ntame character. Lawless and rebellious deeds are sometimes their\r\nsubjects; but they end mostly with an act of retributive justice. We\r\nshall give a specimen of this species before we part with the\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\nBy far the largest portion of Russian popular songs is of the erotic\r\nkind. According to Russian authorities, even their oldest ballads, to\r\njudge from the language,[21] cannot be traced further than to the last\r\nquarter of the sixteenth century; and the number even of these is very\r\nsmall. Most of those now current among the people are derived from the\r\nbeginning of the middle of the last century. According to Goetze, the\r\nreign of Peter the First was very favourable to popular poetry.[52]\r\nHis daughter, the empress Elizabeth, was a successful poetess herself;\r\nand her ditties had a perfectly popular character. If we may draw a\r\nconclusion from the frequency with which modern historical events have\r\ngiven birth to popular ballads, one must suppose that many ancient\r\nones are lost. The victories of Peter the First are celebrated in many\r\npopular ballads, some of which are of no inconsiderable merit; as the\r\nreader will judge for himself from the specimen we give below. The\r\nFrench invasion also, of 1812, which aroused the Russian nation so\r\npowerfully, gave rise to not a few patriotic songs, of many of which\r\nthe authors were peasants and common soldiers.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, various indications, which seem to justify the\r\nbelief, that several of the Russian ballads still current among the\r\npeople are, in fact, more ancient than they appear, or perhaps even\r\nthan they actually are in their present shape. We have not room here\r\nto dwell on this subject. We remark only, that from one circumstance\r\nalone we may draw the safe conclusion, that the Russians have ever\r\nbeen a _singing_ race. We allude to their custom of attaching verses\r\nfull of allusions and sacred meaning to every festival, nay, to every\r\nextraordinary event of human life, and thus of fettering the flying\r\nhours with the garland chains of poetry and song. They have to this\r\nvery day their wedding songs, Pentecost and Christmas carols, and\r\nvarious other songs, named after the different occasions on which they\r\nare chanted, or the game which they accompany. Although these songs,\r\nalso, have been modernized in language and form, they seem always to\r\nhave been regarded with a kind of pious reverence, and appear to have\r\nbeen altered as little as possible. Most of their allusions are, for\r\nthat reason, unintelligible at the present day. That their groundwork\r\nis derived from the age of paganism, is evident from the frequent\r\ninvocations of heathen deities, and from various allusions to heathen\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\nNearly related to these songs are the various ditties of a social\r\nkind, which peasant girls and lads are in the habit of singing on\r\ncertain, stated occasions; for instance, walking songs, dancing songs,\r\nand the like. They consist mostly of endless repetition, often of\r\nwords or single syllables, apparently without meaning; and the tune,\r\nin which these fragmentary poems are sung, is after all the best part\r\nof it. Yet not seldom a spark of real poetry shines through that\r\nmelodious tissue of unmeaning words. What is most remarkable in these\r\nsongs, which have now been more than a century the exclusive property\r\nof the common people, is the utter absence of coarseness and\r\nvulgarity, even in the wedding songs.\r\n\r\nThe Russian songs, like the Russian language, have a peculiar\r\ntenderness, and are full of caressing epithets. These are even\r\nfrequently applied to inanimate objects. A Russian postilion, in a\r\nsimple and charming song, calls the tavern, which he never can make up\r\nhis mind to pass without stopping, \"his dear little mother.\" The words\r\n_Matushka, Batushka, Starinka_, which we may venture to give in\r\nEnglish by _motherling, fatherling, oldling_, are in Russian favourite\r\nterms of endearment. The post-boy's song may stand here as eminently\r\ncharacteristic of the cheerful, childlike, caressing disposition of\r\nthe nation. It is translated in the measure of the original, as nearly\r\nas it could be imitated in English.\r\n\r\nTHE POSTILION.\r\n\r\n  Tzarish Tavern, thou\r\n  Our good motherling,\r\n  So invitingly\r\n  Standest by the way!\r\n  Broad highway, that leads\r\n  Down to Petersburg;\r\n  Fellows young as I,\r\n  As they drive along,\r\n  When they pass thee by,\r\n  Always will turn in.\r\n\r\n  Ah, thou bright sun-light,\r\n  Red and bright sun-light,\r\n  O'er the mountain high,\r\n  O'er the forest oaks;\r\n  Warm the youngster's heart,\r\n  Warm, O warm me, sun;\r\n  And not me alone,\r\n  But my maiden, too.\r\n\r\n  Ah, thou maiden dear,\r\n  Fairest, dearest maid,\r\n  Thou my dearest child,\r\n  Art so kind and good!\r\n  Black those brows of thine,\r\n  Black thy little eyes,\r\n  And thy lovely face\r\n  All so round and white;\r\n  Without painting, white,\r\n  Without painting, red!\r\n\r\n  To thy girdle rolls\r\n  Fair and braided hair;\r\n  And thy voice is soft,\r\n  Full of gentle talk.\r\n\r\n  P.\r\n\r\nRussian lovers are quite inexhaustible in fondling and caressing\r\nexpressions. \"My shining moon, my bright sun, my nourisher\r\n(_Kormiletz_), my light, my hope, my white swan,\" together with all\r\nthose epithets common to all languages, as, _dove, soul, heart_, etc.\r\nare current terms In Russia. Especially favourable to this\r\naffectionate manner of address is the abundance of diminutives which\r\nthe language possesses. Not only \"little soul,\" \"little heart,\"\r\n_Dushinka, Serdzinka_, etc. are favourite expressions of Russian\r\nlovers; but we find even _Yagodka_, \"little berry,\" and _Lapushka_,\r\n\"little paw,\" etc. Love is ingenious in inventing new diminutives for\r\nthe beloved object.\r\n\r\nThis exquisite tenderness in the Russian love-songs is united with a\r\ndeep, pensive feeling, which indeed pervades the whole Russian popular\r\npoetry. Were we to describe the character of this in one expression,\r\nwe should call it _melancholy-musical_. Even the more frivolous and\r\nequivocal songs have a tincture of this pensiveness. While the Servian\r\nsongs of this description are the ebullitions of merry and petulant\r\nyouth, the Russian are frequently not without a spice of\r\nsentimentality. Girls are often represented painting the unhappy\r\nconsequences of their weakness with a very suspicious mixture of\r\npenitence and pleasure; so that the hearer remains undecided, whether\r\nthe former or the latter is predominant.\r\n\r\nIn perfect harmony with this melancholy is the Russian national music.\r\nThe expressive sweetness of the Russian melodies has long been the\r\nadmiration of those foreign composers, to whom circumstances had made\r\nthem known. The history of these melodies is just as uncertain as that\r\nof the verses; they seem always to have been united; no one knows\r\nwhere they came from. In respect to popular tunes and songs, the\r\nanswer which the Ashantees gave to Mr. Bowditch has often occurred to\r\nus: \"They were made when the country was made.\" The Russian tunes are\r\nricher and more varied than are popular airs in general. Of most of\r\nthe songs only the first two verses are set to the melody; all the\r\nfollowing being repeated in the same tune. But there are some which\r\nextend further. Some of these airs include more than a whole octave in\r\ntheir notes; while the national melodies of most other nations move in\r\ngeneral among a few notes.\r\n\r\nTo account for the melancholy character of the Russian music and\r\npoetry, and to reconcile it with the well-known cheerful disposition\r\nof the nation, has been attempted by several Russian critics. \"The\r\npeculiarities of a nation,\" Karamzin remarks, \"may always be explained\r\nby the circumstances which have operated on it; although the\r\ngrandchildren may have some of the virtues and some of the vices of\r\ntheir ancestry, even if they are differently situated. Perhaps the\r\npresent character of the Russians may exhibit faults, which it\r\ncontracted during the barbarism of the Mongolian subjugation.\" The\r\npensiveness which pervades the Russian songs has also been considered\r\nas a remnant of that gloom, necessarily impressed on the Russian\r\ncharacter during two centuries of the most cruel oppression. There is\r\nno doubt that the Russians before, during, and after their subjugation\r\nby the Mongols, had a thousand causes of discouragement and disasters;\r\nbloody civil wars, the most barbarian despotism, the plague,\r\nslavery,[23] and the like. But it is just as certain, that\r\nnotwithstanding all the causes of sorrow, the Russians are still the\r\nmost cheerful and light-hearted people on earth; with all their hearts\r\nand senses enjoying the scanty pleasures of life; though deprived of\r\nall civil privileges, and even of many social rights. The truth is,\r\nthat it is with nations as with individuals. Neither in the one case\r\nnor in the other must we expect always to see them deposit their\r\n_habitual_ feelings in their poetry. It is a well-known fact that\r\nMolière was a man of a most serious disposition. Cowper, immediately\r\nbefore writing his \"John Gilpin,\" was in a mood bordering on despair.\r\nYoung, while composing his melancholy Night Thoughts, enjoyed his life\r\nas well as any man. The Russians do not sing their every-day\r\nsentiments, but their holiday feelings. That sweet pensiveness, which\r\nthrills so affectingly through their music and poetry, is to them a\r\nspecies of luxury. A soft, melancholy emotion, not deep enough indeed\r\nto cause suffering, and slumbering in every-day life in the recesses\r\nof the poet's soul, awakes in the hour of inspiration and spreads a\r\ngentle shadow over his habitual sunshine. The peculiar melancholy\r\n_resignation_ of Slavic lovers we have already attempted to explain.\r\nIndeed, it is to their love songs, principally, that the general\r\nremark on the pensiveness of Russian songs and airs is applicable.\r\n\r\nWe here subjoin some specimens of them. The first is extant in a great\r\nmany versions, differing somewhat from each other. We choose the one\r\nwe like best, as given by Sacharof:[24]\r\n\r\nA PARTING SCENE.\r\n\r\n  \"Sit not up, my love, late at evening hour,\r\n  Burn the light no more, light of virgin wax,\r\n  Wait no more for me till the midnight hour;\r\n  Ah, gone by, gone by is the happy time!\r\n  Ah, the wind has blown all our joys away,\r\n  And has scattered them o'er the empty field.\r\n  For my father dear, he will have it so,\r\n  And my mother dear has commanded it,\r\n  That I now must wed with another wife,\r\n  With another wife, with an unloved one!\r\n  But on heaven high two suns never burn,\r\n  Two moons never shine in the stilly night;\r\n  And an honest lad never loveth twice!\r\n  But my father shall be obey'd by me,\r\n  And my mother dear I will now obey;\r\n  To another wife I'll be wedded soon,\r\n  To another wife, to an early death,\r\n  To an early death, to a forced one.\"\r\n\r\n      Wept the lovely maid many bitter tears,\r\n  Many bitter tears, and did speak these words:\r\n  \"O beloved one, never seen enough,\r\n  Longer will I not live in this white world,\r\n  Never without thee, thou my star of hope!\r\n  Never has the dove more than one fond mate,\r\n  And the female swan ne'er two husbands has,\r\n  Neither can I have two beloved friends.\"\r\n\r\n      No more sits she now late at evening hour,\r\n  But the light still burns, light of virgin wax;\r\n  On the table stands the coffin newly made;\r\n  In the coffin new lies the lovely maid.\r\n\r\nTHE DOVE.\r\n\r\n  On an oak tree sat,\r\n  Sat a pair of doves;\r\n  And they bill'd and coo'd\r\n  And they, heart to heart,\r\n  Tenderly embraced\r\n  With their little wings;\r\n  On them, suddenly,\r\n  Darted down a hawk.\r\n\r\n  One he seized and tore,\r\n  Tore the little dove,\r\n  With his feather'd feet,\r\n  Soft blue little dove;\r\n  And he poured his blood\r\n  Streaming down the tree.\r\n  Feathers too were strew'd\r\n  Widely o'er the field;\r\n  High away the down\r\n  Floated in the air.\r\n\r\n  Ah! how wept and wept;\r\n  Ah! how sobb'd and sobb'd\r\n  The poor doveling then\r\n  For her little dove.\r\n\r\n    \"Weep not, weep not so,\r\n  Tender little bird!\"\r\n  Spake the light young hawk\r\n  To the little dove.\r\n    \"O'er the sea away.\r\n  O'er the far blue sea,\r\n  I will drive to thee\r\n  Flocks of other doves.\r\n  From them choose thee then.\r\n  Choose a soft and blue,\r\n  With his feathered feet,\r\n  Better little dove.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Fly, thou villain, not,\r\n  O'er the far blue sea\r\n  Drive not here to me\r\n  Flocks of other doves.\r\n  Ah! of all thy doves\r\n  None can comfort me;\r\n  Only he, the father\r\n  Of my little ones.\"\r\n\r\n  P.\r\n\r\nThe following little elegy we translate from a Russian Annual; the\r\neditor of which, Baron Delvig, took it down from the lips of a peasant\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nTHE FAITHLESS LOVER.\r\n\r\n  Nightingale, O nightingale,\r\n  Nightingale so full of song,\r\n  Tell me, tell me, where thou fliest,\r\n  Where to sing now in the night?\r\n  Will another maiden hear thee\r\n  Like to me, poor me, all night\r\n  Sleepless, restless, comfortless,\r\n  Ever full of tears her eyes?\r\n  Fly, O fly, dear nightingale,\r\n  Over hundred countries fly,\r\n  Over the blue sea so far;\r\n  Spy the distant countries through,\r\n  Town and village, hill and dell,\r\n  Whether thou find'st any one,\r\n  Who so sad is, as I am?\r\n\r\n  O, I bore a necklace once,\r\n  All of pearls like morning dew;\r\n  And I bore a finger-ring,\r\n  With a precious stone thereon;\r\n\r\n  And I bore deep in my heart\r\n  Love, a love so warm and true.\r\n  When the sad, sad autumn came,\r\n  Were the pearls no longer clear;\r\n  And in winter burst my ring,\r\n  On my finger, of itself![25]\r\n  Ah! and when the spring came on,\r\n  Had forgotten me my love.\r\n\r\nThere is one trait in the Russian character, which we recognize\r\ndistinctly in their poetry, namely, their peculiar and almost Oriental\r\nveneration for their sovereign, and a blind submission to his will.\r\nThere is indeed somewhat of a religious mixture in this feeling; for\r\nthe Tzar is not only the sovereign lord of the country and master of\r\ntheir lives, but he is also the head of the orthodox church. The\r\n_orthodox_ Tzar is one of his standing epithets. The following ballad,\r\nwhich we consider as one of the most perfect among Russian popular\r\nnarrative ballads, exhibits very affectingly the complete resignation\r\nwith which the Russian meets death, when decreed by his Tzar. In its\r\nother features, also, it is throughout natural. Its historical\r\nfoundation is unknown. There are several versions of it extant,\r\nslightly differing from each other; which seems to prove that it has\r\nbeen for a long time handled by the people.\r\n\r\nTHE BOYAR'S EXECUTION.\r\n\r\n  \"Thou, my head, alas! my head,\r\n  Long hast served me, and well, my head;\r\n  Full three-and-thirty summers long;\r\n  Ever astride of my gallant steed,\r\n  Never my foot from its stirrup drawn.\r\n  But alas! thou hast gained, my head,\r\n  Nothing of joy or other good;\r\n  Nothing of honours or even thanks.\"\r\n\r\n  Yonder along the Butcher's street,\r\n  Out to the fields through the Butcher's gate,[26]\r\n  They are leading a prince and peer.\r\n\r\n  Priests and deacons are walking before,\r\n  In their hands a great book open;\r\n  Then there follows a soldier troop,\r\n  With their drawn sabres flashing bright.\r\n  At his right, the headsman goes,\r\n  Holds in his hand the keen-edged sword;\r\n  At his left goes his sister dear,\r\n  And she weeps as the torrent pours,\r\n  And she sobs as the fountains gush.\r\n\r\n  Comforting speaks her brother to her:\r\n  \"Weep not, weep not, my sister dear!\r\n  Weep not away thy eyes so clear,\r\n  Dim not, O dim not thy face so fair,\r\n  Make not heavy thy joyous heart!\r\n  Say, for what is it thou weepest so?\r\n  Is 't for my goods, my inheritance?\r\n  Is 't for my lands, so rich and wide?\r\n  Is 't for my silver, or is 't for my gold?\r\n  Or dost thou weep for my life alone?\"\r\n\r\n  \"Ah, thou, my light, my brother dear,\r\n  Not for thy goods or inheritance,\r\n  Not for thy lands, so rich and wide,\r\n  Is 't that my eyes are weeping so;\r\n  Not for thy silver and not for thy gold,\r\n  'Tis for thy life, I am weeping so.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Ah, thou, my light, my sister sweet!\r\n  Thou mayest weep, but it won't avail;\r\n  Thou mayest beg, but 't is all in vain;\r\n  Pray to the Tzar, but he will not yield.\r\n  Merciful truly was God to me,\r\n  Truly gracious to me the Tzar,\r\n  So he commanded my traitor head\r\n  Off should be hewn from my shoulders strong.\"\r\n\r\n  Now the scaffold the prince ascends.\r\n  Calmly mounts to the place of death;\r\n  Prays to his Great Redeemer there,\r\n  Humbly salutes the crowd around;\r\n  \"Farewell world, and thou people of God;\r\n  Pray for my sins that burden me sore!\"\r\n\r\n  Scarce had the people ventured then\r\n  On him to look, when his traitor head\r\n  Off was hewn from his shoulders strong.[27]\r\n\r\nP.\r\n\r\nWe add another more modern heroic ballad, composed, perhaps, by one of\r\nthe soldiers, who was present at the exploit. The first siege of Azof\r\ntook place in 1695. The fortress was, however, not taken by storm,\r\nalthough repeated assaults were made; but the garrison capitulated in\r\nthe following year. The great white Tzar is of course Peter I.[28]\r\n\r\nTHE STORMING OF AZOF.\r\n\r\n  The poor soldiers have no rest,\r\n    Neither night nor day!\r\n  Late at evening the word was given\r\n    To the soldiers gay;\r\n  All night long their weapons cleaning,\r\n    Were the soldiers good,\r\n  Ready in the morning dawn,\r\n    All in ranks they stood.\r\n\r\n  Not a golden trumpet is it,\r\n    That now sounds so clear;\r\n  Nor the silver flute's tone is it,\r\n    That thou now dost hear.\r\n  'Tis the great white Tzar who speaketh,\r\n    'Tis our father dear.\r\n  Come, my princes, my Boyars,\r\n    Nobles, great and small!\r\n  Now consider and invent\r\n    Good advice, ye all!\r\n  How the soonest, how the quickest,\r\n    Fort Azof may fall?\r\n\r\n  The Boyars, they stood in silence.--\r\n    And our father dear,\r\n  He again began to speak\r\n    In his eye a tear:\r\n  Come, my children, good dragoons,\r\n    And my soldiers all,\r\n  Now consider and invent\r\n    Brave advice, ye all,\r\n  How the soonest, how the quickest,\r\n    Fort Azof may fall?\r\n\r\n  Like a humming swarm of bees,\r\n  So the soldiers spake,\r\n  With one voice at once they spake:\r\n  \"Father, dear, great Tzar!\r\n  Fall it must! and all our lives\r\n  Thereon we gladly stake.\"\r\n\r\n  Set already was the moon,\r\n  Nearly past the night;\r\n  To the storming on they marched,\r\n  With the morning light;\r\n  To the fort with bulwark'd towers\r\n  And walls so strong and white.\r\n\r\n  Not great rocks they were, which rolled\r\n  From the mountains steep;\r\n  From the high, high walls there rolled\r\n  Foes into the deep.\r\n  No white snow shines on the fields,\r\n  All so white and bright;\r\n  But the corpses of our foes\r\n  Shine so bright and white.\r\n  Not up-swollen by heavy rains\r\n  Left the sea its bed;\r\n  No! in rills and rivers streams\r\n  Turkish blood so red!\r\n\r\nDifferent dialects are spoken, and different ballads are sung by the\r\npopulation of Malo-Russia[29] and of those Polish-Russian and\r\nPolish-Austrian provinces, where the peasantry is of the Ruthenian\r\nrace. The musical element is still more prevalent among them; and\r\ntheir ditties are rhymed. The few very ancient ones, which are still\r\nextant, alone make an exception.\r\n\r\nThese have the form and the spirit of the ballads of the Great\r\nRussians, and can in no way be discerned from them; while the great\r\nmass has a different character. Indeed, such an immense number of\r\nballads have originated in the rich and fertile steppes of the\r\nUkraine, that it would seem as if each bough of their forest trees\r\nmust harbour a singer, and each blade of grass on these endless\r\nblooming plains whisper the echo of a song.[30] The pensive character\r\nof the Great Russian popular poetry becomes, in that of the\r\nMalo-Russian and Ruthenian, a deep melancholy, that finds vent in a\r\ngreat variety of sweet, elegiac, melodies. According to the author of\r\na little collection of their popular songs, published first in a\r\nGerman translation, \"these are the after-pains of whole generations;\r\nthese are the sorrows of whole centuries, which are blended in one\r\neverlasting sigh!\" [31] If we look back to the history of these\r\nregions, we cannot doubt that it is the spirit of their past, that\r\nbreathes out of these mournful strains. The cradle of the Kozak stood\r\nin blood; he was rocked to the music of the clashing of swords. For\r\ncenturies the country on both banks of the Dnieper as far as to the\r\nnorthwestern branch of the Carpathian mountains, the seat of this\r\nrace, was the theatre of constant warfare and aggression; there was no\r\ntime for the blessings of a peaceful development. Their narrative\r\nballads have, therefore, few other subjects than the feuds with Poles\r\nand Tartars; the Kozak's parting with his beloved one; or his lonely\r\ndeath on the border, or on the bloody battle field! No wonder that\r\ntheir little lyric effusions have imbibed the same melancholy spirit.\r\n\r\nThese vast level regions were the principal thoroughfares of the\r\nhordes of Mongols and Tartars, who from the thirteenth to the\r\nfifteenth century overspread Russia, and penetrated as far as Silesia.\r\nIn Northern Russia, at least, a shade of the old forms and\r\nconstitutions was preserved; and native princes reigned under Mongol\r\ndominion; but in the South every thing was broken up, and the country\r\nlaid completely waste. Fugitives, reduced to a life of plunder and\r\nbooty, congregated here and there; the country on the Lower Don, near\r\nthe entrance of this river into the sea of Azof, was one of their\r\nstrongholds; another portion found refuge on the islands of the\r\nDnieper, just below the present site of Yekatrinoslav. Here they\r\nfortified themselves in little rude castles; while, after all, their\r\nsituation out of the track of the wild barbarians was their best\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nThe first named region was principally the asylum for fugitives from\r\nGreat Russia; deserters and exiles from other parts of the country\r\njoined them; and the Tartar population, which they found on the spot,\r\nand the neighbouring Kalmuk tribes, mingled with them. These are the\r\nKozaks of the Don; of whom the Kozaks of Grebensk, of Yaitzk, and of\r\nthe Ural, are branches. They are Russians, and sing the songs of their\r\nbrethren, the Russians. The river Don, or, as it is familiarly and at\r\nthe same time respectfully called, _Don Ivanovitch_[32] plays a\r\nprominent part in their ballads. They have a touching childlike love\r\nfor that noble river, so majestic and yet so gentle, that once gave\r\nshelter on its banks to their forefathers. Father Don, the stilly\r\n(_tikho_) Don, Don Ivanovitch, are its constant epithets. The scene of\r\na considerable number of their ballads is in the vessels which glide\r\nupon the 'stilly' Don.\r\n\r\nThe fugitives who had congregated on the Dnieper were also Russians;\r\nbut the mixture of other nations, which they received, would appear to\r\nhave come principally from the Circassians of the Caucasus, as the\r\nstill beautiful shape and countenance of the Tshernomorski seem to\r\nindicate;[33] and also in part from the Ruthenian tribes of the\r\nCarpathian mountains, as their language proves. These are the\r\nZaporoguean Kozaks; so called from having their principal seats beyond\r\nthe _porogues_, or water-falls of the Dnieper. Both sections of the\r\nKozaks founded a kind of military democratic government; and tried to\r\nshelter themselves against their enemies in those rude castles called\r\n_Sicza_, best protected by thick woods and the surrounding water. They\r\nsoon began to spread out in the small towns called _Groazisko_,\r\nfortified also indeed, but built so slightly that they were almost as\r\nsoon erected as destroyed. The Kozaks of the Don, after the\r\ndeliverance of Russia in the second half of the fifteenth century,\r\nacknowledged in some degree the sovereignty of the Russian Tzar; and\r\naided Ivan II to conquer Siberia. They were used by his successors as\r\nborder guardians against the wild Asiatic hordes; whom they partly\r\nchased from their homes in the Ural mountains, and settled there in\r\ntheir stead. Thus they spread all over Siberia; always looking back\r\nwith a pensive and languishing feeling to their \"dear fatherling,\"\r\ntheir gentle \"nourisher,\" their \"stilly Don Ivanovitch.\" [34]\r\n\r\nFrom the Zaporoguean Kozaks, meanwhile, had issued the population of\r\nthe Ukraine. Their first establishment consisted of a strict republic\r\nof warriors; no female was admitted into their strongholds on the\r\nislands of the Dnieper. By degrees they relaxed; and began with\r\nkeeping their families in villages in the vicinity, where they spread\r\nwith incredible rapidity. Then a line of separation was drawn between\r\nthe inhabitants of the settlements, and the Zaporogueans in the\r\ncastles; none of these latter were allowed to marry. Thus their youth\r\nwere always ready for the enemy; and the distinction was only dropped\r\nin more peaceful times. They kept themselves independent of Russia\r\nuntil the latter part of the seventeenth century; but their more\r\ndangerous enemies had long been the Poles, their north-western\r\nneighbours. It was the period of Poland's glory. The Poles were\r\nconquerors in the North and in the East. At last the Kozaks, after a\r\ncentury of struggles, acknowledged the authority of the Polish\r\nsovereign Stephan Bathori (ob. 1586); moved partly, it is said in\r\ntheir traditions, by the personal grandeur of that chevaleresque\r\nmonarch. But now the Polish nobility overspread the Ukraine. They\r\nbecame land-owners and oppressors; and their stewards, their still\r\nmore detested assistants. They were followed by the Jesuits; who\r\nalternately by persuasion and compulsion attempted to entice the\r\nnatives, who all belonged to the Greek church, to come under the\r\ndominion of the Pope. A war of religious persecution and resistance\r\narose. The Kozaks ultimately revolted in 1648; and a few years after\r\n(in 1654) their Hetman Chmielnitzky submitted himself and the whole\r\nUkraine to Tzar Alexei, the father of Peter I.\r\n\r\nThe struggles of this insurrection, their previous feuds with the\r\nPoles their oppressors, and afterwards their repeated revolts from the\r\nRussians, who tried to undermine their liberties, have given birth to\r\na great number of simple ballads, the bold spirit of which presents a\r\nnoble relief to the habitual melancholy of Malo-Russian poetry in\r\ngeneral. They have professional singers, who are called\r\n_Bandurists_; and who, with a kind of simple guitar in their hand,\r\nramble through the country, sure to find a willing audience in\r\nwhatever village they may stop. Their ballads are of course not\r\nconfined to the scenes of the earlier centuries; the more recent wars\r\nwith the Turks and Tartars also, and the campaigns made in modern\r\ntimes in the service of Russia, present subjects enough of interest;\r\nfor their productiveness is still alive, although the race of the\r\nprofessional bards is growing more and more scarce. They call their\r\nhistorical ballads _Dumi_, or _Dumki_, an appellation for historical\r\nelegies, which has recently been adopted by Polish literati.[35]\r\n\r\nWe give here a few characteristic specimens of their poetry; serving\r\nto illustrate their warlike spirit, as well as their domestic\r\nrelations; their skill in narrative ballads, as well as their power of\r\nexpressing in lyric strains the unsophisticated feelings of a tender\r\nheart. We begin with two genuine Kozak elegies.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE MURDER OF YESSAUL TSHURAÏ.[36]\r\n\r\n  O eagle, young gray eagle,\r\n    Tshuraï, thou youth so brave,\r\n  In thine own land, the Pole,\r\n    The Pole dug thee thy grave!\r\n\r\n  The Pole dug thee thy grave,\r\n    For thee and thy Hetman;\r\n  They killed the two young heroes,\r\n    Stephen, the valiant Pan.\r\n\r\n  O eagle, young gray eagle,\r\n    Thy brethren are eagles too;\r\n  The old ones and the young ones,\r\n    Their custom well they knew!\r\n\r\n  The old ones and the young ones\r\n    They are all brave like thee,\r\n  An oath they all did take\r\n    Avenged shalt thou be!\r\n\r\n  The old ones and the young ones,\r\n    In council grave they meet;\r\n  They sit on coal black steeds,\r\n    On steeds so brave and fleet.\r\n\r\n  On steeds so brave and fleet\r\n    They are flying, eagle like;\r\n  In Polish towns and castles\r\n    Like lightning they will strike.\r\n\r\n  Of steel they carry lances,\r\n    Lances so sharp and strong;\r\n  With points as sharp as needles,\r\n    With hooks so sharp and long.\r\n\r\n  Of steel they carry sabres,\r\n    Two edged, blunted never;\r\n  To bring the Pole perdition\r\n    For ever and for ever!\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMENT FOR YESSAUL PUSHKAR.\r\n\r\n  There flows a little river,\r\n    And Worskla is its name;\r\n  And of the little river\r\n    Know old and young the fame.\r\n\r\n  And on the little river,\r\n    They know good songs to sing;\r\n  And on the little river,\r\n    They like good thoughts to think.\r\n\r\n  O thoughts, ye manly thoughts,\r\n    Ye call up sorrow and woe;\r\n  O thoughts, ye manly thoughts,\r\n    From you strong deeds can grow!\r\n\r\n  Where are you, brave Kozaks?\r\n    Where are you, valiant lords?\r\n  Your bones are in the grave,\r\n    In the deep moor your swords!\r\n\r\n  Where art thou, O Pushkar?\r\n    Where art thou, valiant knight?\r\n  Ukraina weeps for thee,\r\n    And for her fate so bright.\r\n\r\n  His bones are in the grave,\r\n    Himself with God is now;\r\n  O weep, O weep, Ukraina,\r\n    An orphan left art thou.\r\n\r\n  Ukraina, thy bright fate\r\n    Destroy'd Wihowski's spell;[37]\r\n  He with the heart of stone,\r\n    And with the mind of hell!\r\n\r\nThe following melancholy song expresses the general hatred against the\r\nPole, the oppressor, in a manner not less strong. _Haidamack_ is\r\nanother name for the Ruthenian peasant under Polish dominion, and\r\nwas formerly, as well as _Burlak_, also applied to the Malo-Russian\r\nKozaks in general.\r\n\r\nSONG OF THE HAIDAMACK.[38]\r\n\r\n  Gladly would I to the war,\r\n      To the war so full of prey,\r\n      Pleasure of the Haidamack!\r\n      But the steward bids me stay,\r\n      Lest the proud Pole's cows should stray!\r\n\r\n  Gladly to the merry dance\r\n      Would I on the gusli play,\r\n      Pleasure of the rosy maid!\r\n      But the steward bids me stay,\r\n      Lest the proud Pole's sheep should stray!\r\n\r\n  Gladly I would hunting go,\r\n      With the bobtailed dog so fleet,\r\n      Pleasure of a good brave youth!\r\n      But the steward bids me stay,\r\n      Lest the proud Pole's steeds should stray!\r\n\r\n  O farewell, thou rosy maid,\r\n      Rattle gently, rusty sabre!\r\n      Quick on horseback, Haidamack!\r\n      Stray may steeds, sheep, cows and all;\r\n      Perish may the haughty Pole!\r\n\r\nWe finish with a few Ruthenian ballads, having no political reference.\r\nThe first is interesting as illustrating a peculiar popular\r\nsuperstition. The Leshes are a kind of Satyrs; covered like them with\r\nhair, and of a very malicious nature. They steal children and young\r\nwomen. Their presence has a certain benumbing influence; a person whom\r\nthey visit cannot move or stir; although, in the case of our ballad,\r\nwe have some suspicion that \"the brandy, the wine, and the mead,\" had\r\nsome preparatory influence.\r\n\r\nThe second exhibits the whole plaintive, yielding mood of a Russian\r\nloving maid; and may be considered as a _characteristic_ specimen.\r\n\r\nSIR SAVA AND THE LESHES.[39]\r\n\r\n  With the Lord at Nemirov\r\n    Sir Sava dined so gladly;\r\n  Nor thought he that his life\r\n    Would end so soon and sadly.\r\n\r\n  Sir Sava he rode home\r\n    To his own court with speed;\r\n  And plenty of good oats\r\n    He bids to give his steed.\r\n\r\n  Sir Sava behind his table\r\n    To write with care begun;\r\n  His young wife she is rocking\r\n    In the cradle her infant son.\r\n\r\n  'Holla! my lad, brisk butler,\r\n    Bring now the brandy to me;\r\n  My well-beloved lady,\r\n    This glass I drink to thee.\r\n\r\n  'Holla! my lad, brisk butler,\r\n    Now bring me the clear wine;\r\n  This glass and this, I drink it\r\n    To this dear son of mine.\r\n\r\n  'Holla! my lad, brisk butler,\r\n    Now bring me the mead so fast;\r\n  My head aches sore; I fear\r\n    I've rode and drunk my last!'\r\n\r\n  Who knocks, who storms so fiercely?\r\n    Sir Sava looks up to know;\r\n  The Leshes stand before him,\r\n    And quick accost him so:\r\n\r\n  'We bow to thee, Sir Sava,\r\n    How far'st thou, tell us now!\r\n  To thy guests from the Ukraina,\r\n    What welcome biddest thou?'\r\n\r\n  'What could I bid you, brethren,\r\n    To-day in welcome's stead?\r\n  Well know I, ye are come\r\n    To take my poor sick head!'\r\n\r\n  'And tell us first, Sir Sava,\r\n    Where are thy daughters fair?'\r\n  'They are stolen by the Leshes,\r\n    And wash their linen there.'\r\n\r\n  'Now to the fight be ready!\r\n    Sir Sava meet thy lot!\r\n  Thy head is lost! one moment,\r\n    Death meets thee on the spot.'\r\n\r\n  The sabre whizzes through the air\r\n    Like wild bees in the wood,\r\n  The young wife of Sir Sava\r\n    By him a widow stood!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOVE-SICK GIRL.[40]\r\n\r\n  Winds are blowing, howling,\r\n    Trees are bending low;\r\n  O my heart is aching,\r\n    Tears in streams do flow.\r\n\r\n  Years I count with sorrow,\r\n    And no end appears;\r\n  But my heart is lighten'd,\r\n    When I'm shedding tears.\r\n\r\n  Tears the heart can lighten,\r\n    Happy make it not;\r\n  E'en one blissful moment\r\n    Ne'er can be forgot.\r\n\r\n  Some there are who envy\r\n    E'en my destiny;\r\n  Say, 'O happy flow'ret\r\n    Blooming on the lea.'\r\n\r\n  On the lea so sandy,\r\n    Sunny, wanting dew!\r\n  O without my lover\r\n    Life is dark to view.\r\n\r\n  Nought can please without him,\r\n    Seems the world a jail;\r\n  Happiness exists not,\r\n    Peace of mind doth fail.\r\n\r\n  Where, dark-browed belov'd one,\r\n    Where, O may'st thou be?\r\n  Come and see, astonished,\r\n    How I weep for thee!\r\n\r\n  Whom shall I now lean on,\r\n    Whose caress receive?\r\n  Now that he who loves me\r\n    Far away doth live?\r\n\r\n  I would fly to thee, love,\r\n   But no wings have I;\r\n  Withered, parch'd, without thee,\r\n   Every hour I die.\r\n\r\nThe following little elegy, heard and written down in Galicia, we have\r\nalways considered as one of the gems of poetry. It is a sigh of deep,\r\nmourning, everlasting love.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEAD LOVE.\r\n\r\n  White art thou, my maiden,\r\n    Can'st not whiter be!\r\n  Warm my love is, maiden,\r\n    Cannot warmer be!\r\n\r\n  But when dead, my maiden,\r\n    White was she still more;\r\n  And, poor lad, I love her,\r\n    Warmer than before.[41]\r\n\r\nOf still greater importance in respect to our subject are the\r\nSERVIANS. We have seen already in this work, that the inhabitants of\r\nthe Turkish provinces of Servia and Bosnia, of Montenegro, of the\r\nAustrian kingdom of Slavonia, of Dalmatia and Military Croatia, speak\r\nessentially the same language; which is likewise the vernacular\r\ndialect of numerous Servian settlements in Hungary, along the\r\nsouth-western shore of the Danube. Of this language, which has been\r\nalternately called Illyrian, Servian, Morlachian, Bosnian, Croatian,\r\nRascian, and perhaps by still other different appellations, it may be\r\ntruly said, that it has more names than dialects; and even the few of\r\nthese latter differ so slightly, that the difference would scarcely be\r\nperceived by a foreigner. It is also true, that, on account of the\r\nvarious systems of writing which have been adopted by the different\r\nsections of this race, the foreigner will sometimes find it more\r\ndifficult to understand the language as written than as spoken.\r\n\r\nThe inexhaustible mine of Servian popular poetry belongs then to the\r\nwhole nation; although, of course, neither the productiveness is every\r\nwhere the same, nor the power and opportunity of preservation. For its\r\nfavourite home we must look to those regions where modern civilization\r\nhas least penetrated; viz. to Turkish Servia, Bosnia, Montenegro.\r\nThere also the vernacular language is spoken with the greatest purity.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent Italian traveller, Abbate Fortis, published about a\r\nhundred years ago an interesting description of the Morlachians, that\r\nis, the Croatian Servian inhabitants of Dalmatia, a tribe\r\ndistinguished by wild passions and proud contempt of civil life; but\r\nfull of poetical feeling, and much attached to old usages and the\r\nrecollections of their ancestors. He printed for the first time some\r\nof their beautiful ancient ballads; but although they were much\r\nadmired in the German versions which Herder and Goethe gave of them\r\n(through the French), the region of their birth remained a _terra\r\nincognita_. To a few literati only it was known, that many of these\r\nballads, although in a spurious shape, had been collected by the\r\nFranciscan monk, Andreas Cacich Miossich; and also that a great many\r\nfragments of remarkable popular heroic songs were scattered, as\r\nillustrations, through the Croatian and Dalmatian dictionaries of\r\nBellosztenecz, Jambressich, and Delia Bella. It was known, too, but\r\nonly by a few, that even ancient Servian historians referred to\r\nsimilar songs.\r\n\r\nVuk Stephanovitch Karadshitch must therefore be called the true\r\ndiscoverer of this mine of beauty; and the judiciousness, patience,\r\nand conscientious honesty, with which his collection was got up,\r\ndeserves the highest praise. Many of the remarkable songs first\r\ncommunicated to the literary public were the reminiscences of his own\r\nyouth; for he was born and brought up in Turkish Servia. Many more he\r\nwas only able to find after years of careful and indefatigable\r\nresearch. His large collection--four volumes with at least five or six\r\nhundred pieces of poetry--was formed upon the principle, that no piece\r\nshould be admitted, for the genuineness of which he could not be\r\npersonally responsible, by having himself heard it from one of the\r\npeople. Nearly the third part of these poems consists of epic tales;\r\nsome of them from five to seven hundred verses long; one, more than\r\ntwelve hundred.\r\n\r\nThe poetry of the Servians is most intimately interwoven with their\r\ndaily life. It is the picture of their thoughts, feelings, actions,\r\nand sufferings; it is the mental reproduction of the respective\r\nconditions of the mass of individuals, who compose the nation. The\r\nhall where the women sit spinning around the fireside; the mountains\r\non which the boys pasture their flocks; the square where the village\r\nyouth assemble to dance the _kolo_,[42] the plains where the harvest\r\nis reaped; the forests through which the lonely traveller\r\njourneys,--all resound with song. Song accompanies all kinds of\r\nbusiness, and frequently relates to it. The Servian _lives_ his\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nThe Servians are accustomed to divide their songs into two great\r\nportions. Short compositions in various measures, either lyric or\r\nepic, and sung without instrumental accompaniment, they call _shenske\r\npjesme_, or _female songs_, because they are mostly made by females.\r\nThe other portion, consisting of long epic tales in verses of five\r\nregular trochaic feet, and chanted to the _Guslé_, a kind of simple\r\nviolin with one chord, they called _Yunatchke pjesme,_ that is,\r\n_heroic_ or _young men's songs_; for it is an interesting fact, that\r\nthe ideas of a _young man_ and of a _hero_, are expressed in Servian\r\nby one and the same word, _Yunak_. The first are, in a very high\r\ndegree, of a domestic character. They accompany us through all the\r\ndifferent relations of domestic life; as well through its daily\r\noccupations, as through the holidays and festivals which interrupt its\r\nordinary course. Much has been said, and more could be said, in praise\r\nof these harmonious effusions of a tender, fresh, and unsophisticated\r\nfeeling; but, as we have already dwelt at large upon their general\r\ncharacter, we must be satisfied here with adding only that which\r\ndistinguishes Servian lays from other Slavic songs.\r\n\r\nAnd this distinction we find principally in the _cheerfulness_, which\r\nis the fundamental element of Servian poetry,--a serenity clear and\r\ntransparent like the bright blue of a southern sky. The allusions to\r\nthe misfortunes of married life alone, gather sometimes in heavy\r\nclouds on this beautiful sky. The fear of being chained to an _old_\r\nman, or of a grim mother-in-law, or the quarrelling of the\r\nsisters-in-law, or the increasing cares of the household,--for, in the\r\ntrue patriarchal style, married sons remain in the house of the\r\nparents, and all make together only one family,--all these\r\ncircumstances disturb sometimes the inexhaustible serenity of the\r\nServian women, and call forth gentle lamentations, or perhaps still\r\noftener horrible imprecations, from their humble breasts. Indeed the\r\nsongs not made for particular occasions also bear strongly and\r\ndistinctly the stamp of domestic life, and are fall of allusions to\r\nfamily relations.\r\n\r\nA spirit of graceful roguery is very prevalent among Servian girls.\r\nTheir social spinning meetings are especially productive of little\r\nwitty ballads, in which men and women are represented as disputing,\r\nand the former, of course, are always outwitted; just as is the case\r\nin numerous English and German popular ballads. But love is also among\r\nthem the grand and prevailing theme. To judge from these songs,\r\nServian girls and youths keep up a frequent and tender intercourse\r\nwith each other. The youth bears carefully in memory the hour when the\r\ngirls go to fetch water; and the frequent festivities, where the dance\r\nis not permitted to fail, give the best opportunity for mutual\r\nintercourse. Further to the south, and between the mountains, the\r\ncustoms are more strict, and love-songs are less frequent.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient songs, recited on certain stated occasions, the\r\nwedding songs, adapted to all the various ceremonies of Slavic\r\nmarriage, are the most remarkable. And here we meet again with one of\r\nthose various contradictions of the mental world, which puzzle\r\nphilosophy. While all the symbolic ceremonies are strongly indicative\r\nof the shameful state of servitude and humiliation, to which the\r\ninstitution of marriage subjects the Slavic woman[43] (for Slavic\r\n_maidens_ are in a certain measure free and happy, and, if beautiful\r\nand industrious, even honoured and sought after;) the _songs_, the\r\nmental reproductions of these coarse, rough, humiliating _acts_, are\r\ndelicate, sprightly, and almost gallant. There are various\r\nindications, that, like the Russian songs of this description, which\r\nthey strongly resemble, they are derived from a very early period.\r\nLike them they have no allusion to church ceremonies.[44]\r\n\r\nThe feeling expressed in their love-songs is in general gentle and\r\noften playful, indicating more of tenderness than of passion. If,\r\nhowever, they are excited to anger, their hatred becomes rage; and is\r\npoured forth in imprecations, of which no other language has a like\r\nmultitude. But these imprecations are not stereotype, as is the case\r\nwith most other nations. They are composed often, with astonishing\r\ningenuity, by the offended persons themselves. Sometimes we see curses\r\ninvoked upon the satisfying of the common wants of life. Thus when the\r\nlad curses his faithless love: \"As much bread as she eats, so much\r\npain may she suffer! as much water as she drinks, so many tears may\r\nshe shed!\"\r\n\r\nWe subjoin a few of these Servian ballads as specimens, just as they\r\nhappen to come to hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARTING LOVERS.\r\n\r\n  To white Buda, to white castled Buda\r\n  Clings the vine-tree, cling the vine-tree branches;\r\n  Not the vine-tree is it with its branches,\r\n  No, it is a pair of faithful lovers.\r\n  From their early youth they were betrothed,\r\n  Now they are compelled to part untimely;\r\n  One addressed the other at their parting:\r\n  \"Go, my dearest soul, and go straight forward,\r\n  Thou wilt find a hedge-surrounded garden,\r\n  Thou wilt find a rose-bush in the garden,\r\n  Pluck a little branch off from the rose-bush,\r\n  Place it on thy heart, within thy bosom;\r\n  Even as that red rose will be fading,\r\n  Even so, love, will my heart be fading.\"\r\n  And the other love this answer gave then;\r\n  \"Thou, dear soul, go back a few short paces,\r\n  Thou wilt find, my love, a verdant forest,\r\n  In the forest stands a cooling fountain,\r\n  In the fountain lies a block of marble;\r\n  On the marble stands a golden goblet,\r\n  In the goblet thou wilt find a snowball.\r\n  Dearest, take that snowball from the goblet,\r\n  Lay it on thy heart within thy bosom;\r\n  Even as the snowball will be melting,\r\n  Even so, love, will my heart be melting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRENDEZVOUS.\r\n\r\n  Sweetheart, come, and let us kiss each other!\r\n  But, O tell me, where shall be our meeting?\r\n  In thy garden, love, or in my garden?\r\n  Under thine or under mine own rose-trees?\r\n  Thou, sweet soul, become thyself a rose-bud;\r\n  I then to a butterfly will change me;\r\n  Fluttering I will drop upon the rose-bud;\r\n  Folks will think I'm hanging on a flower,\r\n  While a lovely maiden I am kissing!\r\n\r\n\r\nST. GEORGE'S DAY.\r\n\r\n  To St. George's day the maiden prayed;\r\n  \"Com'st thou again, O dear St. George's day!\r\n  Find me not here, by my mother dear,\r\n  Or be it wed, or be it dead!--\r\n  But rather than dead, I would be wed!\" [45]\r\n\r\n\r\n  UNITED IN DEATH.\r\n\r\n  Two young lovers loved each other fondly,\r\n  And they washed them at the self-same water,\r\n  And they dried them with the self-same napkin.\r\n  One year passed, their love was known by no one;\r\n  Two years passed, and all the world did know it,\r\n  And the father heard it and the mother;\r\n  And their love the mother would not suffer,\r\n  But she parted the two tender lovers.\r\n\r\n  Through a star the youth sent to the maiden:\r\n  \"Die, O love, on Saturday at evening,\r\n  I, thy youth, will die on Sunday morning.\"\r\n  And they did as they had told each other;\r\n  Died the maiden Saturday at evening.\r\n  Died the youth on Sunday morning early;\r\n  Close together were the two then buried;\r\n  Through the earth their hands were clasped together;\r\n  In their hands were placed two young green apples.\r\n\r\n  Little time had passed since they were buried;\r\n  O'er the youth sprang up a verdant pine-tree,\r\n  O'er the maid a bush with sweet red roses;\r\n  Round the pine-tree winds itself the rose-bush,\r\n  As the silk around a bunch of flowers.\r\n\r\nBut not all the female Servian songs exhibit so much tenderness. That\r\ntheir usual gentleness and humility does not always prevent these poor\r\noppressed beings from sometimes taking the lead in domestic affairs,\r\none would be apt to conclude from the following ballad:\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD MATTERS.\r\n\r\n  Come, companion, let us hurry\r\n  That we may be early home,\r\n  For my mother-in-law is cross,\r\n  Only yestreen she accused me,\r\n  Said that I had beat my husband;\r\n  When, poor soul, I had not touched him.\r\n  Only bid him wash the dishes,\r\n  And he would not wash the dishes;\r\n  Threw then at his head the pitcher,\r\n  Knocked a hole in head and pitcher;\r\n  For the head I do not care much;\r\n  But I care much for the pitcher,\r\n  As I paid for it right dearly;\r\n  Paid for it with one wild apple,\r\n  Yes, and half a one besides.[46]\r\n\r\nObjects of still higher admiration the Servians afford us in their\r\n_heroic_ poems. Indeed, what epic popular poetry is, how it is\r\nproduced and propagated, what powers of invention it naturally\r\nexhibits,--powers which no art can command,--we may learn from this\r\nmultitude of simple legends and complicated fables. The Servians stand\r\nin this respect quite isolated; there is no modern nation, that can be\r\ncompared to them in epic productiveness; and a new light seems to be\r\nthrown over the grand compositions of the ancients. Thus, without\r\npresumption, we may pronounce the publication of these poems one of\r\nthe most remarkable literary events of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe general character of the Servian tales is the _objective_ and the\r\n_plastic_. The poet, in most cases, is in a remarkable degree _above_\r\nhis subject. He paints his pictures not in glowing colours, but in\r\ndistinct, prominent features; no explanation is necessary to interpret\r\nwhat the reader thinks he sees with his own eyes. If we compare the\r\nServian epics with those, which other Slavic nations formerly\r\npossessed, we find them greatly superior. In the Russian _Igor_, the\r\nwhole narrative is exceedingly indistinct; you may read the whole of\r\nit five times, without being able clearly to follow out the\r\ncomposition. Not a single character stands out in relief. The mode of\r\nrepresentation has more of the lyric than of the epic. The ancient\r\nBohemian poems have more distinctness and freshness. No obscurity\r\ndisturbs us. But the passions of the poet break forth so often, as to\r\ngive the whole narration something of the subjective character; while\r\nthe Servian, even when representing his countrymen in combat with\r\ntheir mortal enemies and oppressors, displays about the same\r\npartiality for the former, as Homer for his Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe introductions, not only to the tales themselves, but even to new\r\nsituations, are frequently allegorical. A distinct image is placed\r\nbefore the eyes at once. A tale, describing a famous sanguinary deed\r\nof revenge, commences thus:\r\n\r\n  What's that cry of anguish from Banyani?[47]\r\n  Is 't the Vila? is 't the hateful serpent?\r\n  Were 't the Vila, she were on the summit;\r\n  Were 't the serpent, it were 'neath the mountain;\r\n  Not the Vila is it, nor a serpent;\r\n\r\n  Shrieked in anguish thus Perovitch Balritch\r\n  In the hands of Osman, son of Tchorov. [45]\r\n\r\nRavens are the messengers of unhappy news. The battle of Mishar begins\r\nwith the following verses:\r\n\r\n  Flying came a pair of coal-black ravens\r\n  Far away from the broad field of Mishar,\r\n  Far from Shabatz, from the high white fortress;\r\n  Bloody were their beaks unto the eyelids,\r\n  Bloody were their talons to the ankles;\r\n  And they flew along the fertile Matshva,\r\n  Waded quickly through the billowy Drina,\r\n  Journey'd onward through the honoured Bosnia,\r\n  Lighting down upon the hateful border,\r\n  'Midst within the accursed town of Vakup,\r\n  On the dwelling of the captain Kulin;\r\n  Lighting down and croaking as they lighted.\r\n\r\nThree or four poems, of which courtships or weddings are the subjects,\r\nbegin with a description of the beauty of the girl. Especially rich\r\nand complete is the following:\r\n\r\n  Never since the world had its beginning,\r\n  Never did a lovelier flow'ret blossom,\r\n  Than the flow'ret in our own days blooming;\r\n  Haikuna, the lovely maiden flower.\r\n\r\n  She was lovely, nothing e'er was lovelier!\r\n  She was tall and slender as the pine-tree;\r\n  White her cheeks, but tinged with rosy blushes,\r\n  As if morning's beam had shone upon them,\r\n  Till that beam had reached its high meridian.\r\n  And her eyes, they were two precious jewels,\r\n\r\n  And her eyebrows, leeches from the ocean,\r\n  And her eyelids they were wings of swallows;\r\n  And her flaxen braids were silken tassels;\r\n  And her sweet mouth was a sugar casket,\r\n  And her teeth were pearls arrayed in order;\r\n  White her bosom, like two snowy dovelets,\r\n  And her voice was like the dovelet's cooing;\r\n  And her smiles were like the glowing sunshine;\r\n  And her fame, the story of her beauty,\r\n  Spread through Bosnia and through Herz'govina.\r\n\r\nWe should never end, if we continued thus to extract all the beautiful\r\nand striking passages from the Servian popular lyrics; although their\r\nchief merit by no means consists in beautiful passages, but, in most\r\ncases, in the composition of the whole, and in the distinct, graphic,\r\nand plastic mode of representation. In respect to their style, we add\r\nonly a single remark. Slavic popular poetry in general has none of the\r\nvulgarisms, which, in many cases, deface the popular ballads of the\r\nTeutonic nations. Yet _dignity_ of style cannot be expected in any\r\npopular production. Those whose feelings, from want of acquaintance\r\nwith the poetry of nature, are apt to be hurt by certain undignified\r\nexpressions interspersed unconsciously sometimes in the most beautiful\r\ndescriptions, will not escape unpleasant impressions in reading the\r\nServian songs. The pictures are always fresh, tangible, and striking;\r\nbut, although not seldom the effects of the sublime, and of the\r\ndeepest tragic pathos, are obtained by a perfect simplicity, nothing\r\ncould be more foreign to them than the dignified stateliness and\r\nscrupulous refinement of the French stage.\r\n\r\nThe number and variety of the Servian heroic poems is immense. The\r\noldest legendary cycle is formed by their great Tzar Dushan Nemanyitch\r\nand his heroes; by the pious prince Lazar, their last independent\r\nchief, who was executed by the Turks after having been made prisoner\r\nin battle; and by the death of his faithful knights on the field of\r\nKossovo. The two battles fought here, in 1389 and 1447, put an end to\r\nthe existence of the Servian empire. In immediate connection with\r\nthese epic songs are those of which Marko Kralyewitch, i.e. Marko the\r\nking's son, the Servian Hercules, is the hero; at least thirty or\r\nforty in number. The pictures, which these ballads exhibit, are\r\nextremely wild and bold; and are often drawn on a mythological ground.\r\nIndeed both the epic and the lyric poetry of the Servians are\r\ninterwoven with a traditional belief in certain fanciful creatures of\r\nPagan superstition, which exercise a constant influence on human\r\naffairs. Witches (_Vjashtitzi_), veiled women who go from house to\r\nhouse, carrying with them destruction; the plague, personified as an\r\nold horrible looking female; and also the saints, and among them the\r\n_thunderer_ Elias and the _fiery_ Mary who sends lightning; these all\r\nappear occasionally. But the principal figure is the Vila, a mountain\r\nfairy, having nearly the same character as the northern elementary\r\nspirits; though the malicious qualities predominate, and her\r\nintermeddling is in most cases fatal.\r\n\r\nThere are various features which serve to allay the extreme wildness\r\nand rudeness of the oldest Servian poems. As one of the principal of\r\nthese we consider the solemn institution of a contract of brotherhood\r\nor fraternal friendship, which the Servians seem to have inherited\r\nfrom the Scythians.[49] Two men or two women promise each other before\r\nthe altar, and under solemn ceremonies, in the name of God and St.\r\nJohn, eternal friendship. They bind themselves by this act to all the\r\nmutual duties of brothers and sisters. Similar relations exist also\r\nbetween the two sexes, when a maid solemnly calls an old man her\r\n\"father in God,\" or a young one her \"brother in God;\" or when a man\r\ncalls a woman his \"mother or sister in God.\" This is mostly done in\r\ncases of distress. When a person, thus appealed to, accepts the\r\nappellation, they are in duty bound to protect and to take care of the\r\nunfortunate, who thus give themselves into their hands; according to\r\nthe prevailing notion, a breach of this contract is severely punished\r\nby Heaven. Marko Kralyevitch was united in such an alliance with the\r\nVila; in modern times we find it sometimes between Turks and Servians\r\nin the midst of their most bitter feuds.\r\n\r\nThe traditional ballads of the Servians, referring to the heroes of\r\ntheir golden time, are undoubtedly in their groundwork of great\r\nantiquity; but as until recently they have been preserved only by\r\ntradition, it cannot be supposed, that they have come down in their\r\npresent form from the original time of their composition; which was\r\nperhaps nearly cotemporary to the events they celebrate. In most of\r\nthem frequent Turcisms show, that the singer is familiar with the\r\nconquerors and their language. According to Vuk, very few are in their\r\npresent form older than the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe more modern heroic ballads--for the productiveness of this\r\nremarkable people is still alive--are essentially of the same\r\ncharacter. They may be divided into two parts. One division, probably\r\ncomposed during the last two centuries and down even to the present\r\ntime, is devoted to a variety of subjects, public and private. Duels,\r\nlove stories, satisfaction of blood-revenge, domestic quarrels and\r\nreconciliation, are alternately related. The variety of invention in\r\nthese tales is astonishing; the skill of the combinations and the\r\nfinal development surpasses all that hitherto has been known of\r\npopular poetry. One of the most remarkable of them is a narrative of\r\n1227 lines; which relates to the marriage of a young man, Maxim\r\nTzernovitch, son of Ivan Tzernovitch, a wealthy and powerful\r\nServian. The father goes to Venice to ask in marriage for his son the\r\ndaughter of the Doge. He describes him as the handsomest of young men;\r\nbut, when he comes home, he finds him metamorphosed by the smallpox\r\ninto the ugliest. By the advice of his wife, he substitutes another\r\nhandsome young man to fetch home the bride with the procession of\r\nbridal guests; promising him the principal share in the bridal gifts;\r\nfor he commits the fraud less from covetous views than from pride,\r\nbeing afraid of being put to shame as unable to keep his word before\r\nthe haughty Venetians. They succeed in bringing away the bride; but\r\nthe cheat is discovered on the road; a contest arises, and the whole\r\naffair ends in a horrible slaughter.\r\n\r\nVuk Stephanovitch has heard this tale repeatedly, and with several\r\nvariations; but the principal features, for instance a rich and\r\nelaborate description of the bridal gifts, were always recited exactly\r\nin the same words. It was chanted in the most perfect manner by an old\r\nsinger, named Milya, whom prince Milosh often had to sing it before\r\nhim; and from whose lips Vuk at last took it down.\r\n\r\nAnother section of more modern ballads narrates events from the latest\r\nwar between the Servians and Turks, between 1801 and 1815. Who of our\r\nreaders has not heard of Kara George? His companions, Yanko Katitch,\r\nStoyan Tchupitch, Milosh of Potzerye, are in Servia as well known and\r\nadmired as Kara George himself. They and their comrades are the heroes\r\nof these ballads. The gallant Tchupitch rewarded the blind poet\r\nPhilip, who chanted to him a long and beautiful poem of his own\r\ncomposition, with a white horse. The subject of his narrative was the\r\nbattle of Salash; where Tchupitch himself had been the Servian\r\ncommander.[59]\r\n\r\nThe same ballad singer Philip is the author of most of the modern\r\nheroic poems. Of others the authors are not known. Little stress is\r\nlaid on the art of poetry; exercised with such extraordinary power.\r\nThese productions of our day are by no means inferior to the ancient.\r\nThere is indeed no essential difference, either in their diction or in\r\ntheir conception; and it is easy to be perceived, that old and young\r\nhave been nursed from their infancy on tales of \"the days of yore.\"\r\nSome passages of Philip's ballads are really Homeric.[51] Fortunately,\r\nthe period is past when our admiration for hyperborean poetry needed\r\nto be justified by its similarity with the classics. We have learned\r\nthat real poetry is not spell-bound to names, nor to any nation or\r\nage; and the _beautiful_ has obtained in our time an independent\r\nexistence, no longer subject to certain forms and conditions, but\r\nresting on itself and its divine gifts.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties Vuk Stephanovitch met with in collecting these\r\nwonderful ballads, were not small. He was often hardly able to prevail\r\non the young men and girls to recite, still less to sing them before\r\nhim; partly from a natural shyness to exhibit themselves before a\r\nstranger; partly because his search after effusions which had so\r\nlittle value in their eyes, and his attempt to fix them by writing,\r\nseemed to them an idle and useless occupation. The only reason which\r\nthey could conceive for it was, that the learned idler meant to\r\nridicule them; and his request was frequently answered by the words:\r\n\"We are no blind men to sing or recite songs to you.\"\r\n\r\nOf the heroic poems, he tells us, that they are not only chanted, but\r\noften recited, as _we_ are accustomed to _read_; and that in this\r\nlatter way, old people teach them by preference to the children. His\r\nown father, grandfather, and uncle, were wont to recite and to sing\r\nthem; and the two latter even composed not a few. Among those from\r\nwhose lips he took down the present collection, were lads, peasants,\r\nmerchants, as also hayduks, i.e. highwaymen, in Servia a mode of life\r\nless disreputable than with us, and somewhat approaching to heroism.\r\nFurther, at least seven or eight were blind men; all of them\r\nprofessional bards, and almost the only persons willing to satisfy\r\nhim. The _shenske pjesme_, or female poems, he had to catch by chance;\r\nand short as they are, it was easy to keep them in memory after having\r\nheard them once or twice.\r\n\r\nWhile these latter poems are mostly sung without any instrumental\r\naccompaniment in the spinning-rooms, in the pastures, or at the\r\nvillage dances; on the other hand the tavern, the public squares, the\r\nfestive halls of the chiefs, are the places where the Guslè is heard\r\nwhich accompanies the heroic ballads. The bard chants two lines; then\r\nhe pauses and gives a few plaintive strokes on his primitive\r\ninstrument; then he chants again, and so on. He needs these short\r\npauses for recollection, as well as for invention. Although these\r\nballads are chiefly sung by blind men, yet no hero thinks it beneath\r\nhim to chant them to the Guslè. Pirch, a Prussian officer, who\r\ntravelled in Servia some twenty years ago, tells us, that the Knjas,\r\nhis host, took the instrument from the hands of the lad, for whom he\r\nhad sent to sing before his guest, because he did not satisfy him, and\r\nplayed and chanted himself with a superior skill. Clergymen themselves\r\nare not ashamed to do it. Nay, even Muhammedan-Bosnians, more Turks\r\nthan Servians, have preserved this partiality for their national\r\nheroics. The great among them would not, indeed, themselves sing them;\r\nbut they cause them to be chanted before them; and it happened, that a\r\nChristian prisoner in Semendria obtained his liberty by their\r\nintercession with the Kadi, which he owed merely to their fondness for\r\nhis ballads. A considerable number of fine songs are marked in Vuk's\r\ncollection as having been first heard from Muhammedan singers.\r\n\r\nAlthough the same ballads are not heard every where, yet the poetical\r\nfeeling and productiveness seem to be pretty equally distributed over\r\nall the region inhabited by the Servian race. The heroic ballads\r\noriginate mostly in the southern mountains of Servia, in Bosnia,\r\nMontenegro, and its Dalmatian neighbourhood. Towards the North-East\r\nthe productiveness diminishes; the songs are still _known_ in the\r\nAustrian provinces, but the recitation of them, and the Guslè itself,\r\nare left to blind men and beggars. Pirch heard, nevertheless, the\r\nballads of Marko Kralyevitch in the vicinity of Neusatz, in Hungary.\r\nOn the other hand, the amatory Servian ballads, and all those\r\ncomprised under the name of female songs,--although by no means\r\nexclusively sung by women,--originate chiefly in those regions, where\r\nperhaps a glimpse of occidental civilization has somewhat refined the\r\ngeneral feeling. The _villages_ of Syrmia, the Banat, and the Batchva,\r\nare the home of most of them; in the Bosnian towns also they are\r\nheard; while in the _cities_ of the Austrian provinces they have been\r\nsuperseded by modern airs of less value, perhaps, and certainly of\r\nless nationality.\r\n\r\nIt remains to remark, that while in all the other Slavic popular\r\npoetry, the _musical_ element is prominent, it is in the Servian\r\ncompletely crowded into the background. Even the little lyric pieces,\r\nor female ballads, are not only in a high degree monotonous, but even\r\nwithout the peculiar sweetness of most popular airs. They also are\r\nchanted rather than sung.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarian language is said to be particularly rich in popular\r\nballads; and it would hardly be credible, that the numerous nations\r\nwith which they mixed for centuries, should not have influenced their\r\npoetry as well as their language. Nevertheless, those ballads we have\r\nmet with are not distinguished in any way from the Servian; especially\r\nfrom those Servian ones sung in the provinces where intercourse with\r\na Turkish population is more frequent. One specimen will be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE GANGS.[52]\r\n\r\n  O thou hill, thou high green hill!\r\n  Why, green hill, art thou so withered?\r\n  Why so withered and so wilted?\r\n  Did the winter's frost so wilt thee?\r\n  Did the summer's heat so parch thee?\r\n      Not the winter's frost did wilt me,\r\n  Nor the summer's heat did parch me,\r\n  But my glowing heart is smothered.\r\n  Yesterday three slave gangs crossed me;\r\n  Grecian maids were in the first row,\r\n  Weeping, crying bitterly:\r\n  \"O our wealth! art lost for ever!\"\r\n  Black-eyed maidens from Walachia\r\n  Weeping, crying in the second:\r\n  \"O ye ducats of Walachia!\"\r\n  Bulgar women in the third row,\r\n  Weeping, crying, \"O sweet home!\r\n  O sweet home! beloved children!\r\n  Fare ye well, farewell for ever!\"\r\n\r\nThe SLOVENZI or VINDES, that is, the Slavic inhabitants of Camiola and\r\nCarinthia, have of course their own ballads, which have been recently\r\ncollected. That the influence of the German population, with whom they\r\nlive intermingled, has been very great, even in these songs, cannot be\r\nmatter of surprise. It is, however, chiefly discernible in the\r\nmelodies they sing; which are said to be the same familiar to the\r\nGerman mountaineers of Styria and Tyrol. Several narrative ballads of\r\nsome length are still extant among them, similar to the Servian, but\r\nrhymed. These have been communicated to the German public in a\r\ntranslation by their poet Anastasius Grun. They are all too long to be\r\ngiven here as specimens; we therefore confine ourselves to the\r\nfollowing pretty little song:\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE DOVELET.[53]\r\n\r\n  \"Where were you, and where have you stray'd\r\n          In the night?\r\n  Your shoes are all with dew o'erlaid;\r\n          In the night, in the night.\"\r\n\r\n  I strayed there in the cool green grove,\r\n          In the night.\r\n  There flutters many a turtle dove,\r\n          In the night, in the night.\r\n\r\n  They have such little red cheeks, they all,\r\n          In the night;\r\n  And bills so sweet, and bills so small,\r\n          In the night, in the night.\r\n\r\n  There I stood, lurking on the watch,\r\n          In the night;\r\n  Till one little dovelet I did catch,\r\n          In the night, in the night.\r\n\r\n  It had of all the sweetest bill,\r\n          In the night;\r\n  Red rose, its cheeks were redder still,\r\n          In the night, in the night.\r\n\r\n  That dovelet now caresses me\r\n          In the night;\r\n  And kissing each other we'll ever be,\r\n          In the night, in the night.\r\n\r\nThe field of popular poetry, which the Slavic nations of the WESTERN\r\nSTEM present to us, promises a gleaning of a comparatively inferior\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the Königshof manuscript, that five centuries ago the\r\nBOHEMIANS _had_ a treasure of popular poetry. This document exhibits\r\nalso the extraordinary fact, that almost the same ballads were sung in\r\nBohemia in the thirteenth century, which are now heard from the lips\r\nof Russian and Servian peasant girls. The reader may compare the\r\nfollowing songs, all of them faithfully translated.\r\n\r\nANCIENT BOHEMIAS SONGS.\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  O my rose, my fair red rose,\r\n  Why art thou blown out so early?\r\n  Why, when blown out, frozen?\r\n  Why, when frozen, withered?\r\n  Withered, broken from the stem!\r\n\r\n  Late at night I sat and sat,\r\n  Sat until the cocks did crow;\r\n  No one came, although I waited\r\n  Till the pine-torch all burned low.\r\n\r\n  Then came slumber over me;\r\n  And I dreamed my golden ring\r\n\r\n  Sudden slipp'd from my right hand;\r\n  Down my precious diamond fell.\r\n  For the ring I looked in vain,\r\n  For my love I longed in vain!\r\n\r\n\r\n  II.[55]\r\n\r\n  O, ye forests, dark green forests,\r\n  Miletinish forests!\r\n  Why in summer and in winter,\r\n  Are ye green and blooming?\r\n  O!

During\r\nthe thirty years' war, of which Bohemia was in part almost\r\nuninterruptedly the seat, a complete revolution in manners,\r\ninstitutions, and localities, took place. Whole villages emigrated, or\r\nwere driven into the wide world, wandering about in scattered groups\r\nas fugitives and mendicants. Most of the ancient songs may have died\r\nat that time. The German influence increased rapidly during the\r\nremainder of the seventeenth century, mostly by force and reluctantly;\r\nstill more during the eighteenth century by habit, intermarriages,\r\neducation, etc. The Bohemians, the most musical nation in the world,\r\nare still a singing people; but many of their ditties are evidently\r\nborrowed from the German; in others, invented by themselves, they\r\nexhibit a spirit entirely different from that of their ancestors.\r\nThese modern songs are mostly rhymed. The following specimen of songs\r\nstill current among the peasantry of Bohemia, will show well the\r\nharmless, playful, roguish spirit that pervades them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORSAKEN MAIDEN.\r\n\r\n  Little star with gloomy shine,\r\n  If thou couldst but cry!\r\n  If thou hadst a heart, my star,\r\n  Sparks would from thee fly,\r\n  Just as tears fall from mine eye.\r\n\r\n  All the night with golden sparks\r\n  Thou wouldst for me cry!\r\n  Since my love intends to wed,\r\n  Only 'cause another maid\r\n  Richer is than I.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERAL PAY.\r\n\r\n  Flowing waters meet each other,\r\n  And the winds, they blow and blow;\r\n  Sweetheart with her bright blue eyes\r\n  Stands and looks from her window.\r\n\r\n  Do not stand so at the window,\r\n  Rather come before the door;\r\n  If thou giv'st me two sweet kisses,\r\n  I will give thee ten and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAPPY DEATH.\r\n\r\n  In a green grove\r\n  Sat a loving pair;\r\n  Fell a bough from above,\r\n  Struck them dead there.\r\n  Happy for them,\r\n  That both died together;\r\n  So neither was left,\r\n  To mourn for the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LYING BIRD.\r\n\r\n  What chatters there the little bird,\r\n    On the oak tree above?\r\n  It sings, that every maid in love\r\n    Looks pale and wan from love.\r\n\r\n  My little bird, thou speak'st not true,\r\n    A lie hast thou now said;\r\n  For see, I am a maid in love,\r\n    And am not pale, but red.\r\n\r\n  Take care, my bird; because thou liest,\r\n    I now must punish thee;\r\n  I take this gun, I load this gun,\r\n    And shoot thee from the tree.\r\n\r\nIn the following fine ballad the German influence is manifest. It is\r\nextant in two different texts. We give it in Bowring's version, which\r\nhas less of amplification and embellishment than is usual in English\r\ntranslations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEAD LOVE.\r\n\r\n  I sought the dark wood where the oat grass was growing;\r\n  The maidens were there and that oat grass were mowing.\r\n\r\n  And I called to those maidens: \"Now say if there be\r\n  The maiden I love 'midst the maidens I see?\"\r\n\r\n  And they sighed as they answered: \"Ah no! alas no!\r\n  She was laid in the bed of the tomb long ago.\" [57]\r\n\r\n  \"Then show me the way where my footsteps must tread,\r\n  To reach that dark chamber, where slumber the dead.\"\r\n\r\n  \"The path is before thee, her grave will be known,\r\n  By the rosemary wreaths her companions have thrown.\"\r\n\r\n  \"And where is the church in church-yard, whose heaps\r\n  Will point out the bed where the blessed one sleeps?\"\r\n\r\n  So twice to the church-yard in sadness I drew,\r\n  But I saw no fresh heap and no grave that was new.\r\n\r\n  I turned, and with heart-chilling terror I froze,\r\n  And a newly made grave at my feet slowly rose.\r\n\r\n  And I heard a low voice, but it audibly said,\r\n  \"Disturb not, disturb not the sleep of the dead!\r\n\r\n  \"Who treads on my bosom? what footsteps have swept\r\n  The dew from the bed where the weary one slept?\"\r\n\r\n  \"My maiden, my maiden, so speak not to me,\r\n  My presents were once not unwelcome to thee!\"\r\n\r\n  \"Thy presents were welcome, but none could I save,\r\n  Not one could I bring to the stores of the grave.\r\n\r\n  \"Go thou to my mother, and bid her restore\r\n  To thy hands every gift which I valued before.\r\n\r\n  \"Then fling the gold ring in the depth of the sea,\r\n  And eternity's peace shall be given to me.\r\n\r\n  \"And sink the white kerchief deep, deep in the wave,\r\n  That my head may repose undisturbed in the grave!\"\r\n\r\nThe Slovaks, the Slavic inhabitants of the north-western districts of\r\nHungary, are considered, as we have seen above, as the direct\r\ndescendants of the first Slavic settlers in Europe. Although for\r\nnearly a thousand years past they have formed a component part of the\r\nHungarian nation, they have nevertheless preserved their language and\r\nmany of their ancient customs. Their literature, we know, is not to be\r\nseparated from that of the Bohemians. Their popular effusions are\r\noriginal; although, likewise, between them and the popular poetry of\r\ntheir Bohemian brethren, a close affinity cannot be denied. The\r\nSlovaks are said to be still exceedingly rich in pretty and artless\r\nsongs, both pensive and cheerful; but the original Slavic type is now\r\nvery much effaced from them. The surrounding nations, and above all\r\nthe Germans, have exercised a decided and lasting influence upon them.\r\n\r\nThe following ballads are still heard among the Slovaks. The first of\r\nthem is also extant in an imperfect German shape. As the coarse\r\ndialect, in which the German ballad may be heard, is that of the\r\n\"Kuhländchen,\" a small district of Silesia, where the Slavic\r\nneighbourhood has not been without influence, we have no doubt that\r\nthe more complete Slavic ballad is the original.\r\n\r\n  THE MOTHER'S CURSE.\r\n\r\n  The maiden went for water,\r\n  To the well o'er the meadow away;\r\n  She there could draw no water,\r\n  So thick the frost it lay.\r\n\r\n  The mother she grew angry;\r\n  She had it long to bemoan;\r\n  \"O daughter mine, O daughter,\r\n    I would thou wert a stone!\"\r\n\r\n  The maiden's water-pitcher\r\n    Grew marble instantly;\r\n  And she herself, the maiden,\r\n    Became a maple tree.\r\n\r\n  There came one day two lads,\r\n    Two minstrels young they were;\r\n  \"We've travelled far, my brother,\r\n    Such a maple we saw no where.\r\n\r\n  \"Come let us cut a fiddle,\r\n    One fiddle for me and you;\r\n  And from the same fine maple,\r\n    For each one, fiddlesticks two.\"\r\n\r\n  They cut into the maple,--\r\n    There splashed the blood so red;\r\n  The lads fell on the ground,\r\n    So sore were they afraid.\r\n\r\n  Then spake from within the maiden:\r\n    \"Wherefore afraid are you?\r\n  Cut out of me one fiddle,\r\n    And for each one, fiddlesticks two.\r\n\r\n  \"Then go and play right sadly,\r\n    To my mother's door begone,\r\n  And sing: Here is thy daughter,\r\n    Whom thou didst curse to stone.\"\r\n\r\n  The lads they went, and sadly\r\n    Their song to play began;\r\n  The mother, when she heard them,\r\n    Right to the window ran:\r\n\r\n  \"O lads, dear lads, be silent,\r\n    Do not my pain increase;\r\n  For since I lost my daughter,\r\n    My pain doth never cease!\"\r\n\r\n  SUN AND MOON.\r\n\r\n  Ah! if but this evening\r\n    Would come my lover sweet,\r\n  With the bright, bright sun,\r\n    Then the moon would meet.\r\n\r\n  Ah! poor girl this evening\r\n    Comes not thy lover sweet;\r\n  With the bright, bright sun,\r\n    The moon doth never meet.\r\n\r\nThe reader will perceive that these Slovakian songs are rhymed. There\r\nare however also rhymeless verses extant among them; the measure of\r\nwhich seems to indicate a greater antiquity, and brings them nearer to\r\nthe nations of the Eastern stock.[58]\r\n\r\nOf all the Slavic nations, the POLES, as we have already remarked, had\r\nmost neglected their popular poetry. There were indeed several\r\ncollections of popular ballads published, partly by Polish editors,\r\nwith the title of popular poetry in Poland. But they all, without\r\nexception, so far as we know, refer to the Ruthenian peasantry in\r\nPoland, who use a language different from the Polish, and essentially\r\nthe same as the Malo-Russian. These tribes, inhabitants of Poland for\r\ncenturies, may indeed be called _Poles_ with perfect propriety. Yet\r\nthis name is in a more limited sense applied to the Lekhian race\r\nexclusively; and it is in respect to them that we remarked above, that\r\ntheir songs had been collected for the first time only a few years\r\nago.[59]\r\n\r\nThat they also had national ballads of their own could hardly be a\r\nmatter of doubt; and the neglect may easily be explained, in a nation\r\namong whom all that has any reference to mere boors and serfs has\r\nalways been regarded with the utmost contempt. Their beautiful\r\nnational dances, however, known all over the world, the graceful\r\nPolonaise, the bold Masur, the ingenious Cracovienne, are just as much\r\nthe property of the peasantry, as of the nobility. Their dances were\r\nformerly always accompanied by singing; just as it was customary in\r\nolden times every where, and as it is still the usage among the\r\nRussian and Servian peasantry, to dance to the music of song instead\r\nof instruments. But these songs are always extemporized; and in Poland\r\nprobably were never written down. The early refinement of the language\r\nsecured to the upper classes a greater or lesser share in their\r\nnational literature, which gave them apparently better things;\r\nalthough we have seen above, that, far from developing itself from its\r\nown resources, their literature was alternately ingrafted on a Latin,\r\nItalian, or French stock. Among the country gentry, and even at the\r\nconvivial parties of the nobility, the custom of extemporizing songs,\r\nprobably full of national reminiscences, continued even down to the\r\nbeginning of our own century. Very little stress was naturally laid\r\nupon them; since the interest for all that is national, historical, or\r\nin any way connected with the people, belongs only to the most recent\r\ntimes. In our day, the local scenes of Lithuania have excited some\r\ninterest, and the Ukraine has become the favourite theatre of Polish\r\npoets.\r\n\r\nThe Polish nation has an ancient hymn, which may be said to belong in\r\nsome measure to popular poetry. It is known under the name of _Boga\r\nRodzica_, or God's Mother; and is said to have been composed by St.\r\nAdalbert, who lived at the end of the tenth century. According to\r\nNiemcewicz, the Polish poet, it was still chanted in the year 1812 in\r\nthe churches of Kola and Gnesen, the places where St. Adalbert lived\r\nand died. It is a prayer to the Virgin, ending with a sixfold Amen;\r\nand was formerly sung by the soldiers when advancing to battle. For\r\nthat reason probably we find it frequently called a war song.\r\n\r\nThe popular ballads, published by Woicicki and Zegota Pauli, are not\r\ndistinguished in any way from those still extant among the Slovakians,\r\nBohemians, and Lusatian Sorabians. It can only be matter of surprise,\r\nthat they have imbibed no more of the wild and romantic character of\r\nthe ballads sung by the Ruthenians, with whom they live intermingled\r\nin several regions. They are ruder in form; and alternately rhymed, or\r\ndistinguished from prose only by a certain irregular but prosodic\r\nmeasure, sometimes trochaic, but mostly dactylic. With the classical\r\nbeauty of the Servian songs they can bear no comparison; in which\r\nlatter the perfect absence of _vulgarity_ may perhaps be partly\r\naccounted for, by their having been produced among a people where no\r\nprivileged classes exist. Only in their wedding songs, and other\r\nsimilar ones, is there a striking affinity; it is in general in these\r\nrelics of ancient times, that the popular poetry of the nations of the\r\nEastern and of the Western Stems meet in one distinct and fundamental\r\naccord.\r\n\r\nMany of the more ancient ballads extant among the Poles we find also\r\nin one or other of the Western Slavic languages. For example, the\r\nfollowing; which exists in the Vendish language in a shape more\r\ndiffuse and twice as long; and also in Slovakian, still more\r\nsketchlike. That the Polish ballad is derived from a time, when the\r\nhorrid invasions of the Tartars were at least still distinctly\r\nremembered, we may safely conclude. In the Slovakian ballad the\r\ninvaders are called Turks; in the Vendish ballad, probably the latest\r\nof the three, they have lost all individual nationality, and have\r\nbecome merely \"enemies,\" or \"robbers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE INVASION OF THE TARTARS.[60]\r\n\r\n  Plundering are the Tartars,\r\n  Plundering Jashdow castle.\r\n\r\n  All the people fled,\r\n  Only a lad they met.\r\n\r\n  \"Where's thy lord, my lad?\r\n  Where and in what tower\r\n  Is thy lady's bower?\"\r\n\r\n  \"I must not betray him,\r\n  Lest my lord should slay me.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Not his anger fear,\r\n  Thou shalt stay not here,\r\n  Thou shalt go with us.\"\r\n\r\n  \"My lord's and lady's bower\r\n  Is in the highest tower.\"\r\n\r\n  Once the Tartars shot,\r\n  And they hit them not.\r\n\r\n  Twice the Tartars shot,\r\n  And they killed the lord.\r\n\r\n  Thrice the Tartars shot--\r\n  They are breaking in the tower,\r\n  The lady is in their power.\r\n\r\n  Away, away it goes,\r\n  Over the green meadows,\r\n  Black, black the walls arose!\r\n\r\n  \"O lady, O turn back,\r\n  To thy walls so sad and black.\r\n\r\n  \"O walls, ye dreary walls!\r\n  So sad and black are you,\r\n  Because your lord they slew!\r\n\r\n  \"Because your lord is slain,\r\n  Your lady is dragged away\r\n  Into captivity!\r\n  A slave for life to be,\r\n  Far, far in Tartary!\"\r\n\r\nAmong the ballads of almost all nations we find some that illustrate\r\nthe mournful and destitute state of _motherless orphans_. There seems\r\nto be hardly any feeling, which comes more directly home to the\r\naffectionate compassion of the human heart, than the pitiable and\r\ntouching condition of helpless little beings left to the tender\r\nmercies of a _stepmother_; who, with her traditional severity, may be\r\ncalled a kind of standing bugbear of the popular imagination. The\r\nDanes have a beautiful ballad, in which the ghost of a mother is\r\nroused by the wailings and sufferings of her deserted offspring, to\r\nbreak with supernatural power the gravestone, and to re-enter, in the\r\nstillness of the night, the neglected nursery, in order to cheer, to\r\nnurse, to comb and wash the dear seven little ones, whom God once\r\nintrusted to her care. It is one of the most affecting pieces of\r\npopular poetry we ever have met with. The Slavic nations have nothing\r\nthat can be compared with it in _beauty_; but most of them have\r\nseveral ballads on the same subject; and in a general collection, the\r\n\"Orphan Ballads\" would fill a whole chapter.[61] The simple ditty\r\nwhich we give here as another specimen of Polish popular poetry,\r\nexceedingly rude as it is in its form, and even defective in rhyme and\r\nmetre, cannot but please and touch us by its very simplicity.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOR ORPHAN CHILD.[62]\r\n\r\n  Poor little orphan is wandering about,\r\n  Seeking its mother and weeping aloud.\r\n\r\n  Jesus Christ met it, mildly to it spake:\r\n  \"Where art thou roaming, poor little babe?\r\n\r\n  \"Go not, go not, babe, too far thou wilt roam,\r\n  And goest e'er so far, not to thy mother come.\r\n\r\n  \"Now turn and go, dear babe, to the green cemetery,\r\n  From out her deep grave thy mother will speak to thee.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Wo! at my grave who's knocking so wild?\"\r\n  \"Mother! dear mother! it's I, thy poor child!\r\n\r\n    \"Take me to thee, take me,\r\n    Ill I fare without thee!\"\r\n\r\n  \"Go home, my babe, and thy strange mother tell,\r\n  She'll wash thy tattered shirt and comb and clean thee well!\"\r\n\r\n    \"When my shirt she washes,\r\n    Sprinkles it with ashes.\r\n\r\n    \"When she puts it on to me,\r\n    Scolds so grim and bitterly!\r\n\r\n    \"When she combs my head,\r\n    Runs the blood so red.\r\n\r\n    \"When she braids my hair,\r\n    Pulls me here and there!\"\r\n\r\n  \"Go thee home, my babe, the Lord thy tears will dry!\"\r\n  And the babe went home, laid her down to cry.\r\n\r\n  Laid her down to cry, one day only cried;\r\n  Groaned the second day, and the third day died.\r\n\r\n  From his heaven our Lord did two angels send,\r\n  With the poor babe they did to heaven ascend.\r\n\r\n  From the hell our Lord did two devils send;\r\n  They took the bad stepmother and down to hell they went.\r\n\r\nOf all the surviving Slavic tribes, we have seen that the nationality\r\nof the VENDES of Lusatia is most endangered. If formerly, as a race,\r\nthey suffered from persecution and oppression, they have now for\r\nseveral centuries shared all the advantages of an enlightened\r\neducation and wise institutions with their German countrymen; and it\r\nwould therefore be erroneous to consider them still in the light of an\r\noppressed or subjugated nation. Although their language cannot be said\r\nto be _favoured_ by the government, they have their schools, their\r\nworship, their courts of justice, and, above all, their ballads,\r\nwithout let or hinderance; and if nevertheless the statistics of each\r\nyear, especially in the plains of Lower Lusatia, show a diminution of\r\nthe Slavic speaking population, we must attribute it rather to the\r\nnatural and irresistible effect of time and circumstances, than to any\r\ndespotic or arbitrary measures of the government. The Vendish\r\nvillages are flourishing; the costumes of the peasants are heavy and\r\nrich; and to their general welfare the _cheerful_ merry character of\r\ntheir ballads seems to bear testimony. Their melodies resemble the\r\nBohemian, as much as their ballads do those of their neighbours; but\r\nGerman melodies also are frequently heard among them, and many\r\ntranslations of German popular ballads have become perfectly\r\nnaturalized. That the language of Upper Lusatia approaches very near\r\nto the Bohemian, we have stated above. It is, however, much more\r\ninterspersed with German words; although not to such a degree as the\r\nLower Lusatian dialect.\r\n\r\nOf all the Slavic popular ballads, we find in those of the Lusatians\r\nleast of that chaste feeling, which is in general characteristic of\r\nSlavic love songs. The pleasures of illicit intercourse and their\r\nconsequences, which make also a favourite theme of the common English\r\nand German ballads, are often grossly described; and we may conclude\r\nthat the talent of extemporizing, or in general making pretty verses,\r\nhas forsaken the female villagers in this German neighbourhood, and\r\npassed over to the men.\r\n\r\nWe give here two characteristic ballads of the Upper Lusatian\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORPHAN'S LAMENT.[63]\r\n\r\n  Far more unhappy in the world am I,\r\n  Than on the meadow the bird that doth fly.\r\n\r\n  Little bird merrily flits to and fro,\r\n  Sings its sweet carol upon the green bough.\r\n\r\n  I, alas, wander wherever I will,\r\n  Every where I am desolate still!\r\n\r\n  No one befriends me, wherever I go.\r\n  But my own heart full of sorrow and woe!\r\n\r\n  Cease thy grief, oh my heart, full of grief,\r\n  Soon will a time come that giveth thee relief.\r\n\r\n  Never misfortune has struck mo so hard,\r\n  But I ere long again better have fared.\r\n\r\n  God of all else in the world has enough;\r\n  Why not then widows and orphans enough?[64]\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD ADVICE FOR LADS.\r\n\r\n  Let him who would married be,\r\n  Look about him and take care,\r\n  That he does not take a wife,\r\n      Take a wife;\r\n  He'll repent it till his life.\r\n\r\n  If thou shouldst make up thy mind,\r\n  And shouldst take too young a wife,\r\n  Youthful wife has boiling blood,\r\n      Boiling blood;\r\n  No one thinks of her much good.\r\n\r\n  If thou shouldst make up thy mind,\r\n  And shouldst take too old a wife,\r\n  In the house she'll creep about,\r\n      Creep about;\r\n  And will frighten people out.\r\n\r\n  If thou shouldst make up thy mind,\r\n  And shouldst take a handsome wife,\r\n  Nought but trouble she will give,\r\n      Trouble give;\r\n  Others' visits she'll receive.\r\n\r\n  If thou shouldst make up thy mind,\r\n  And shouldst take too short a wife,\r\n  Lowly thou must stoop to her,\r\n      Stoop to her,\r\n  Wouldst thou whisper in her ear.\r\n\r\n  If thou shouldst make up thy mind,\r\n  And shouldst take too tall a wife,\r\n  Ladders thou to her must raise,\r\n      Ladders raise,\r\n  If thou wouldst thy wife embrace.\r\n\r\n  If thou shouldst make up thy mind,\r\n  And shouldst take a snarling wife,\r\n  Thou wilt want no dog in the house,\r\n      Dog in the house;\r\n  Thy wife will be the dog in the house.\r\n\r\n  As for poor ones, let them be,\r\n  Nothing they will bring to thee,\r\n  Every thing will wanting be,\r\n      Wanting be;\r\n  Not a soul will come to thee.\r\n\r\n  If thou shouldst make up thy mind,\r\n  And shouldst take a wealthy wife,\r\n  Then with patience thou must bear,\r\n      Thou must bear,\r\n  If the breeches she should wear.\r\n\r\n  Pretty, modest, smart, and neat,\r\n  Good and pious she must be;\r\n  If thou weddest such a wife,\r\n      Such a wife,\r\n  Thou'lt not repent it all thy life.\r\n\r\nMerry ballads like these are usually sung at wedding feasts, where\r\nseveral of the old Slavic ceremonies are still preserved; among other\r\nthings the bringing home of the bride in solemn procession. Many old\r\nverses, mostly fragments of half forgotten ballads, familiar to their\r\nancestors, are in like manner occasionally recited. But the poetical\r\natmosphere, which still weaves around the Russian or Servian maiden a\r\nmystical veil, through which she gazes, as in a dream full of golden\r\nillusions and images, into that condition of new existence feared and\r\ndesired by her at once--that atmosphere is destroyed by the lights of\r\nthe surrounding civilization, which show the sober reality of things\r\nin full glare. The flowers are withered that were wound around the\r\nchains; but the chains themselves have become lighter. The ancient\r\nwedding songs, full of pagan allusions, have been supplanted by glees\r\nmostly composed by their half German pastors; the only educated men\r\nwho still speak their language. Indeed, not a few of their most\r\npopular ballads are written by their curates. How soon these will be\r\nsuperseded by German songs, no one can say; but it requires no great\r\nstretch of prophetic power to predict, that the time is near at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Volks und Meisterlieder_, Frankf. a.M. 1817.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _De Bello Gothico_, lib. iii. c. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Vol. I. p. 69.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Geschichte der Slavischen Sprache und Literatur_, p.\r\n52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: This song is among the few, which Russian critics think\r\nas ancient as the sixteenth century.
