From that period\r\nuntil the seventeenth century, the house of Maxwell continued to enjoy\r\nsignal proofs of royal favour; it was employed in important services and\r\non high missions, extending its power and increasing its possessions by\r\nintermarriages with the richest and noblest families in Scotland. An\r\nenumeration of the honours and privileges enjoyed by this valiant race\r\nwill show in how remarkable a degree it was favoured by the Stuarts, and\r\nhow various and how forcible were the reasons which bound it to serve\r\nthat generous and beloved race of Scottish monarchs.\r\n\r\nHerbert, who succeeded John de Maxwell, was one of the Commissioners\r\nsent by Alexander the Second to England, to treat for a marriage with\r\none of the daughters of that crown; and, having concluded the\r\nnegotiation favourably, was endowed with the office of Lord Great\r\nChamberlain of Scotland, which he held during his life-time, and which\r\nwas afterwards bestowed on his son.\r\n\r\nEustace de Maxwell, in the time of Robert de Bruce, was among those\r\npatriots who adhered to the Scottish King. The Castle of Carlaverock,\r\none of the most ancient possessions of the brave Maxwells, stands a\r\nmemento, in its noble ruins, of the disinterested loyalty of its owners.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Carlaverock afford but a slight notion of its former\r\nstrength. The importance of its situation is, however, undoubted.\r\nSituated on the south borders of the Nith, near to Glencapel Quay, it\r\nconstituted a stronghold for the Scottish noble, who scarcely feared a\r\nsiege within its walls, and when the army of Edward advanced to invest\r\nit, refused to surrender; \"for the fortress was well furnished,\" says\r\nGrose, \"with soldiers, engines, and provisions.\"\r\n\r\nBut this defiance was vain; after sustaining an assault, Carlaverock was\r\nobliged to capitulate; when the generosity of Edward's measures excited\r\nthe admiration of all humane minds. The troops, only sixty in number,\r\nwere taken into the King's service, as a token of his approval of their\r\nbrave defence; they were then released, ransom free, and received each a\r\nnew garment, as a gift from the King.\r\n\r\nCarlaverock was, some time after, retaken by the Scotch, and Sir Eustace\r\nde Maxwell resumed his command over the garrison. It was again invested\r\nby King Edward; but, on this occasion, Eustace drove the English from\r\nthe attack, and retained possession of the fortress.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, of his own free will, he demolished the fortress, that no\r\npossession of his might favour the progress of the enemy. He was\r\nrewarded by several grants of lands, and twenty-two pounds in money.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century, Herbert de Maxwell marrying a daughter of the\r\nMaxwells of Terregles (Terre Eglise), the son of that marriage was\r\nennobled, and was dignified by the title of Lord de Maxwell. His\r\nsuccessor perished at Flodden, but the grandson of the first Lord had a\r\nhappier fortune, and was entrusted by James the Fifth to bring over\r\nMary of Guise to Scotland, first marrying her as the King's proxy.\r\n\r\nThe house of Maxwell prospered until the reign of James the Sixth; by\r\nwhom John, Lord Maxwell, was created Earl of Morton, and made Warden of\r\nthe Marches: but a reverse of fortune ensued. From some court intrigue,\r\nthe Warden was removed from office, and his place supplied by the Laird\r\nof Johnstones; all the blood of the Maxwells was aroused; a quarrel and\r\na combat were the result; and, in the scuffle, the new-made Earl of\r\nMorton was killed. The injury was not forgotten, and John, who succeeded\r\nthe murdered man, deemed it incumbent upon him to avenge his father. In\r\nconsequence, the Laird of Johnstone soon fell a sacrifice to this notion\r\nof honour, or outbreak of offended pride. The crime was not, however,\r\npassed over by law; the offender was tried, and executed, in 1613, at\r\nthe Cross in Edinburgh; and his honours were forfeited. But again the\r\nfavour of the Stuarts shone forth; the title of Morton was not restored,\r\nbut Robert, the brother of the last Earl of Morton, was created Earl of\r\nNithisdale, and restored to the Lordship of Maxwell; with precedency, as\r\nEarl, according to his father's creation as Earl of Morton.\r\n\r\nThis kindness was requited by a devoted loyalty; and, in the reign of\r\nCharles the First, the Earl of Nithisdale suffered much, both by\r\nsequestration and imprisonment, for the royal cause.\r\n\r\nIn 1647, in consequence of failure of the direct line, the title and\r\nestates of the Nithisdale family devolved on a kinsman, John Lord\r\nHerries, whose grandson, William, the subject of this memoir, proved to\r\nbe the last of the Maxwell family that has ever enjoyed the Earldom.\r\n\r\nHe was served heir male, and of line male and entail of his father, on\r\nthe twenty-sixth of May, 1696; and heir male of his grandfather, the\r\nEarl of Nithisdale, on the sixteenth of the same month.[1] At his\r\naccession to his title, the Earl of Nithisdale possessed no common\r\nadvantages of fortune and station. \"He was allied,\" says the Scottish\r\nPeerage, \"to most of the noble families in the two kingdoms.\" His\r\nmother, the Lady Lucy, was daughter to the Marquis of Douglas; his only\r\nsister, Lady Mary Maxwell, was married to Charles Stewart, Earl of\r\nTraquair; and he had himself wedded a descendant of that noble and brave\r\nMarquis of Worcester who had defended Ragland Castle against Fairfax.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these family honours, Lord Nithisdale possessed rich\r\npatrimonial estates in one of the most fertile and luxuriant counties in\r\nScotland. The Valley of the Nith, from which he derived his title, owned\r\nhis lordship over some of its fairest scenes. Young, rich, and happily\r\nmarried, he was in the full sunshine of prosperity when, in the year\r\n1715, he was called upon to prove the sincerity of that fidelity to the\r\nhouse of Stuart for which his family had so greatly suffered, and for\r\nwhich it had been so liberally repaid.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the adventurers in the unfortunate cause of the\r\nChevalier St. George were, with rare exceptions, men of established\r\ncredit, men who had vast stakes in their country, and who had lost no\r\nportion of their due consideration in the eyes of others by extravagance\r\nor profligacy. This fact marks the insurrection of 1715, as presenting a\r\nvery different aspect to that of other insurrections raised by faction,\r\nand supported by men of desperate fortunes. So early as the year 1707,\r\nit appears by Colonel Hooke's secret negotiations in favour of the\r\nStuarts, that the bulk of the Scottish nobility had their hearts engaged\r\nin the cause, and that their honour was pledged to come forward on the\r\nfirst occasion. In the enumeration given by one of the agents employed\r\nin traversing the country, Lord Nithisdale and his relatives are\r\nmentioned as certain and potent allies. \"In Tweedale,\" writes Mr.\r\nFleming to the Minister of Louis the Fourteenth, \"the Earl of Traquair,\r\nof the house of Stuart, and the Laird of Stanhope are powerful. In the\r\nshires of Annandale, Niddesdale, and Galloway, are the Earl of\r\nNiddesdale, with the Viscount of Kenmure, the Laird of Spinkell, with\r\nthe numerous clan of the Maxwells; and there is some hope also of the\r\nEarl of Galloway; Thus the King's party is connected through the whole\r\nkingdom, and we are certain of being masters of all the shires, except\r\nArgyleshire, Clydesdale, Renfrew, Dumbarton, and Kyle.\"[2] \"An affair\r\nof this nature,\" adds Mr. Fleming, \"cannot be communicated to all the\r\nwell affected; and it is a great proof of the zeal of those to whom it\r\nis trusted, that so many people have been able to keep this secret so\r\ninviolably.\" Such was the commencement of that compact which, held\r\ntogether by the word of Scotchmen, was in few instances broken; but was\r\nmaintained with as scrupulous a regard to honour and fidelity by the\r\npoorest Highlander that ever trod down the heather, as by the great\r\nnobleman within his castle hall.\r\n\r\nAmong the list of the most considerable chiefs in Scotland, with an\r\naccount of their disposition for or against the Government, the Earl of\r\nNithisdale is specified by contemporary writers as one who is able to\r\nraise three hundred men, and willing to employ that force in the service\r\nof the Pretender.[3]\r\n\r\nIn the resolution to carry the aid of his clansmen to the service of\r\neither side, the chieftain of that day was powerfully assisted by the\r\nblind devotion of the brave and faithful people whom he led to battle.\r\nUnhappily, the influence of the chief was often arbitrarily, and even\r\ncruelly exerted, in cases of doubtful willingness in their followers.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to scrutinize the motives and characters of those\r\nwho occupied the chief posts in command, upon the formation of this\r\nSouthern party in favour of the Chevalier. Although some of these\r\nchiefs have obtained celebrity in history, yet their efforts were\r\nsincere; their notions of patriotism, be they just, or be they\r\nerroneous, deserve a rescue from oblivion; their sufferings, and the\r\nheroism with which they were encountered, show to what an extent the\r\nfixed principle to which the Scotch are said ever to recur, will carry\r\nthe exertions, and support the fortitude, of that enduring and\r\ndetermined people.\r\n\r\nTo William Gordon, Viscount Kenmure and Baron of Lochinvar, was\r\nentrusted, in a commission from the Earl of Mar, the command of the\r\ninsurgents in the south of Scotland. This choice of a General displayed\r\nthe usual want of discernment which characterized the leaders of the\r\nRebellion of 1715. Grave, and as a contemporary describes him, \"full\r\naged;\" of extraordinary knowledge in public affairs, but a total\r\nstranger to all military matters; calm, but slow in judgment; of\r\nunsullied integrity,--endowed, in short, with qualities truly\r\nrespectable, but devoid of energy, boldness, and address, yet wanting\r\nnot personal courage, there could scarcely have been found a more\r\nexcellent man, nor a more feeble commander. At the head of a troop of\r\ngentlemen, full of ardour in the cause, the plain dress and homely\r\nmanners of Lord Kenmure seemed inappropriate to the conspicuous station\r\nwhich he held; for the exercise of his functions as commander was\r\nattended by some circumstances which required a great combination of\r\nworldly knowledge with singleness of purpose.\r\n\r\nGeorge Seaton, the fifth Earl of Wintoun, was another of those noblemen\r\nwho raised a troop of horse, and engaged, from the very first\r\ncommencement of the rebellion, in its turmoils. The family of Seaton, of\r\nwhich the Earl of Wintoun was the last in the direct line, \"affords in\r\nits general characteristics,\" says a celebrated Scottish genealogist,\r\n\"the best specimen of our ancient nobility. They seem to have been the\r\nfirst to have introduced the refined arts, and an improved state of\r\narchitecture in Scotland. They were consistent in their principles, and,\r\nupon the whole, as remarkable for their deportment and baronial\r\nrespectability, as for their descent and noble alliances.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of so many great families having sprung from the Seatons,\r\nthey were styled \"_Magnae Nobilitatis Domini_;\" and their antiquity was\r\nas remarkable as their alliances, the male representation of the family,\r\nand the right to the honours which they bore, having been transmitted to\r\nthe present Earl of Eglintoun, through an unbroken descent of seven\r\ncenturies and a half.\r\n\r\nThe loyalty of the Seatons was untainted. The first Earl of Wintoun had\r\nadopted as one of his mottoes, \"_Intaminatis fulget honoribus_,\" and the\r\nsense of those words was fully borne out by the testimony of time. The\r\nSeatoun Charter Chest contained, as one of their race remarked, no\r\nremission of any offence against Government, a fact which could not be\r\naffirmed of any other Scottish family of note. But this brave and\r\nancient house had signal reason for remaining hitherto devoted to the\r\nmonarchs of the Scottish throne.\r\n\r\nFour times had the Seatons been allied with royalty: two instances were\r\nremarkable. George Seatoun, second Earl of Huntly, married the Princess\r\nAnnabella, daughter of James the First, and from that union numerous\r\ndescendants of Scottish nobility exist to this day: and George, the\r\nthird Lord Seaton, again allied his house with that of Stuart, by\r\nmarrying the Lady Margaret Stuart, daughter of the Earl of Buchan, and\r\ngranddaughter of Robert the Second. In consequence of these several\r\nintermarriages, it was proverbially said of the house of Seaton, \"the\r\nfamily is come of princes, and reciprocally princes are come of the\r\nfamily.\" And these bonds of relationship were cemented by services\r\nperformed and honours conferred. The devotion of the Seatons to Mary,\r\nQueen of Scots, has been immortalised by the pen of Sir Walter Scott.\r\nGeorge, the seventh Lord Seaton, attended on that unhappy Princess in\r\nsome of the most brilliant scenes of her eventful life, and clung to her\r\nin every vicissitude of her fate. He, as Ambassador to France,\r\nnegotiated her marriage with the Dauphin, and was present at the\r\ncelebration of the nuptials. He afterwards aided his royal mistress to\r\nescape from Lochleven Castle, in 1568, and conducted her to Niddry\r\nCastle, his own seat. When, in gratitude for his fidelity, Mary would\r\nhave created him an Earl, Lord Seaton declined the honour, and\r\npreferred his existing rank as Premier Baron of Scotland. Mary\r\ncelebrated his determination in a couplet, written both in French and in\r\nLatin:\r\n\r\n    \"Il y a des comtes, des rois, des ducs aussi,\r\n    Ce't assez pour moy d'estre Signeur de Seton.\"\r\n\r\nThe successor of Lord Seaton, Robert, judged differently from his\r\nfather, and accepted from James the Sixth the patent for the Earldom of\r\nWintoun; distinguishing the new honour by a courage which procured for\r\nhim the appellation of \"Greysteel.\"[5]\r\n\r\nGeorge, the fifth Earl of Wintoun, and the unfortunate adherent to the\r\nJacobite cause, succeeded to the honours of his ancestors under\r\ncircumstances peculiarly embarrassing. His legitimacy was doubted: at\r\nthe time when his father died, this ill-fated young man was abroad, his\r\nresidence was obscure; and as he held no correspondence with any of his\r\nrelations, little was known with regard to his personal character. In\r\nconsequence partly of his absence from Scotland, partly, it is said, of\r\nan actual hereditary tendency, a belief soon prevailed that he was\r\ninsane, or rather, as a contemporary expresses it, \"mighty subject to a\r\nparticular kind of caprice natural to his family.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThe Viscount Kingston, next heir to the title of Wintoun, having\r\nexpressed his objections to Lord Wintoun's legitimacy, the young man, in\r\n1710, took steps to establish himself as his father's heir. Two\r\nwitnesses were produced who were present at the marriage of his\r\nparents, and bonds were found in the family chests, designating Lord\r\nWintoun as \"our eldest lawful son,\" by Dame Christian Hepburn Countess\r\nof Wintoun, \"our spouse.\" This important point being established, Lord\r\nWintoun served himself heir to his father and became the possessor of\r\nthe family estates, chiefly situated in East Lothian, their principal\r\nresidence being the palace of Seaton, so recognized in the royal\r\ncharters, from its having been the favourite resort of royalty, the\r\nscene of entertainment to Mary of Scots, and her court, and the\r\nresidence of Charles the First, when in Scotland in 1633. It was\r\nafterwards the place of meeting for the Jacobite nobles, and their\r\nadherents.[7]\r\n\r\nDiffering from many of his companions in arms, Lord Wintoun was a\r\nzealous Protestant; but without any regard to the supremacy of either\r\nmode of faith, it appears to have been a natural consequence of his\r\nbirth and early associations that he should cling to the house of the\r\nStuarts. One would almost have applied to the young nobleman the term\r\n\"recreant,\" had he wavered when the descendant of Mary Stuart claimed\r\nhis services. But such a course was far from his inclination. It was\r\nafterwards deemed expedient by his friends to plead for him on the\r\nground of natural weakness of intellect; \"but,\" says a contemporary,\r\n\"Lord Wintoun wants no courage, nor so much capacity as his friends find\r\nit for his interest to suggest.\"[8] He was forward in action, and\r\nstimulated the military ardour of his followers, as they rushed with\r\ntheir ancient cry of \"Set-on\" to the combat. The earliest motto borne on\r\nthese arms by the Seatons, \"Hazard, yet forward,\" might indeed be\r\nmournfully applied to all who engaged in the hopeless Rebellion of 1715.\r\n\r\nLord Wintoun, like Lord Derwentwater, was in the bloom of his youth when\r\nhe summoned his tenantry to follow him to the rendezvous appointed by\r\nLord Kenmure. He took with him three hundred men to the standard of\r\nJames Stuart; but he appears to have carried with him a fiery and\r\ndetermined temper,--the accompaniment, perhaps, of noble qualities, but\r\na dangerous attribute in times of difficulty.\r\n\r\nRobert Dalzell, sixth Earl of Carnwath, was another of those Scottish\r\nnoblemen whose adherence to the Stuarts can only be regarded as a\r\nnatural consequence of their birth and education. The origin of his\r\nfamily, which was of great antiquity in the county of Lanark, but had\r\nbeen transplanted into Nithisdale, is referred to in the following\r\nanecdote. In the reign of Kenneth the Second, a kinsman of the King\r\nhaving been taken and hung by the Picts, a great reward was offered by\r\nKenneth, if any one would rescue and restore the corpse of his relation.\r\nThe enterprise was so hazardous, that no one would venture on so great a\r\nrisk. \"At last,\" so runs the tale, \"a certain gentleman came to the\r\nKing, and said, 'Dalziel,' which is the old Scottish word for 'I dare.'\r\nHe performed his engagement, and won for himself and his posterity the\r\nname which he had verified, and an armorial bearing corresponding to the\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\nTo James the First and to Charles the First the Dalziels owed their\r\nhonours, and had the usual fortune of paying dearly for them, during the\r\nGreat Rebellion, by sequestration, and by the imprisonment of Robert,\r\nfirst Earl of Carnwath, after the battle of Worcester, whither he\r\nattended Charles the Second. Undaunted by the adversities which his\r\nhouse had formerly endured, Robert Dalzell, of Glenae, sixth Earl of\r\nCarnwath, again came forward in 1715 to maintain the principles in which\r\nhe had been nurtured, and to assist the family for whom his ancestors\r\nhad suffered. During his childhood, the tutor of this nobleman had made\r\nit his chief care to instil into his mind the doctrine of hereditary\r\nright, and its consequent, passive obedience and non-resistance. At the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, young Dalzell had imbibed an affection for the\r\nliturgy and discipline of the Church of England; whilst his attainments\r\nhad kept pace with the qualities of his heart, and the graces of his\r\ndeportment. He was, in truth, a young man of fair promise, and one whose\r\nfate excited great interest, when a sombre tranquillity had succeeded to\r\nthe turbulence of rebellion. Gentle in his address, affable,\r\nkind-hearted, Lord Carnwath had a natural and ready wit, and a great\r\ncommand of language, to which his English education had doubtless\r\ncontributed. He was related by a former marriage between the families to\r\nthe Earl of Wintoun, whose troop was commanded by Captain James Dalzell,\r\nthe brother of Lord Carnwath. This young officer had served in the army\r\nof George the First, but he threw up his commission at the beginning of\r\nthe Rebellion,--a circumstance which saved him from being shot at\r\nPreston as a deserter.[9]\r\n\r\nRobert Balfour, fifth Earl of Burleigh, was among the chiefs who,\r\nshortly after the outbreak, avowed their adherence to the Pretender's\r\nparty. He was one of the few Jacobites whose personal character has\r\nreflected discredit upon his motives, and disgraced his compeers: his\r\nstory has the air of romance, but is perfectly reconcilable with the\r\nspirit of the times in which Lord Burleigh figured.\r\n\r\nWhen a very young man he became attached to a girl of low rank, and was\r\nsent abroad by his friends in hopes of removing his attachment. Before\r\nhe quitted Scotland, he swore, however, that if the young woman married\r\nin his absence, he would kill her husband. Upon returning home, he found\r\nthat the unfortunate object of his affections had been united to Henry\r\nStenhouse, the schoolmaster at Inverkeithing. The threat had not been\r\nuttered without a deep meaning: young Balfour kept his word, and\r\nhastening to the school where Stenhouse was pursuing his usual duties,\r\nhe stabbed him in the midst of his scholars. The victim of this\r\nmurderous attack died twelve days afterwards.\r\n\r\nNearly eight years had elapsed since the crime had been perpetrated, and\r\nthe wretched murderer had encountered, since that time, his trial, in\r\nthe Court of Justiciary, and had received sentence of death by\r\nbeheading; but he escaped from prison a few days previously, by\r\nexchanging clothes with his sister. He was then a commoner; but in 1714,\r\nthe title of Lord Burleigh, and an estate of six hundred and\r\nninety-seven pounds yearly, devolved upon him. When the Rebellion broke\r\nout, his restless spirit, as well, perhaps, as the loss of reputation,\r\nand the miseries of reflection, impelled him to enter into the contest.\r\n\r\nSuch were the principal promoters of the insurrection in the south of\r\nScotland; they were held together by firm bonds of sympathy, and their\r\nplans were concerted in renewed conferences at stated periods.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-ninth of May was, of course, religiously observed by this\r\nincreasing and formidable party. During the previous year (1714) the\r\nJacobite gentry had met at Lochmaben, under pretence of a horse-racing;\r\nand, although it does not appear that the Earl of Nithisdale was among\r\nthose who assembled on that occasion, yet several of his kinsmen\r\nattended. The plates which were the prizes had significant devices: on\r\none of them were wrought figures of men in a falling posture; above them\r\nstood one \"eminent person,\" the Pretender, underneath whom were\r\ninscribed the words from Ezekiel, xxi. 27, \"I will overturn, overturn,\r\noverturn it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is,\r\nand I will give it him.\" When the races were ended, Lord Burleigh, then\r\nMaster of Burleigh, led the way to the Cross of Lochmaben, where, with\r\ngreat solemnity, drums beating, and colours displayed, those there\r\ncolected drank to \"_their King's health;_\" the Master of Burleigh\r\ngiving the toast, and uttering an imprecation on all such as should\r\nrefuse to pledge it. These meetings had been continued for several\r\nyears, and, during the reign of Queen Anne, without any molestation from\r\nGovernment.[10] Lord Nithisdale took a decided part in all these\r\nmeasures, and was one of those who were considered as entirely to be\r\ntrusted by the Earl of Mar, with regard to the projected arrival of the\r\nPretender in Scotland. On the sixth of August, 1715, that project was\r\ncommunicated by Mar to the Earl of Nithisdale, through the medium of\r\nCaptain Dalzell, who was despatched likewise to Lord Kenmure, and to the\r\nEarl of Carnwath. Lord Nithisdale obeyed the summons, and met the great\r\ncouncil of the Jacobite nobles at Braemar, where the decisive and\r\nirrevocable step was taken.\r\n\r\nLord Nithisdale, in common with the other members of what was now termed\r\nthe Jacobite Association, had been diligently preparing the contest.\r\nMeetings of the Association had been frequent, and even public. The\r\nfinest horses had been bought up at any cost, with saddles and\r\naccoutrements, and numbers of horse-shoes. Many country gentlemen, who\r\nwere in the habit of keeping only two or three saddle-horses at a time,\r\nnow collected double the number; and a suspicion prevailed that it was\r\nthe intention of some, who were Jacobites, to mount a troop. But no\r\nseizure had been made of their property in the last reign, there being\r\nfew justices of the peace in Dumfriesshire, nominated by Queen Anne, who\r\nwere not in the service of the Chevalier.[11] Trained bands were,\r\nhowever, soon raised by the well-affected gentry of the county for the\r\nprotection of the neighbourhood; and Nithisdale was traversed by armed\r\nbands,--Closeburn House, then the residence of Sir Thomas\r\nKirkpatrick,[12] being a frequent point of union for the friends of the\r\nHanoverian interests to assemble.[13] At Trepons, in the upper part of\r\nNithisdale, was the first blood drawn that was shed in this disastrous\r\nquarrel, Mr. Bell of Nimsea, a Jacobite gentleman, being there shot\r\nthrough the leg by one of the guards, on his refusing to obey\r\norders.[14] The occurrence was typical of the remorseless cruelty which\r\nwas afterwards exhibited towards the brave but unfortunate insurgents.\r\n\r\nBy a clause in the act \"for encouraging loyalty in Scotland,\" passed on\r\nthe thirtieth of August, power was given to the authorities to summon to\r\nEdinburgh all the heads of the Jacobite clans, and other suspected\r\npersons, by a certain day, to find bail for their good conduct. Among\r\nthe long list of persons who were thus cited to appear, was the Earl of\r\nNithisdale. Upon his non-appearance, he was, with the rest, denounced,\r\nand declared a rebel.[15] This citation was followed by an outbreak on\r\nthe part of Lord Kenmure and his followers, simultaneous to that on\r\nwhich the Northumberland Jacobites had decided. And the borders now\r\nbecame the chief haunts of the insurgents, who continued moving from\r\nplace to place, and from house to house, in order to ripen the scheme\r\nwhich involved, as they considered, their dearest interests.\r\n\r\nThe loyal inhabitants of Dumfries were engaged, one Saturday, in the\r\nsolemnities of preparation for the holy sacrament, when they received\r\nintimation of a plot to surprise and take possession of the town on the\r\nfollowing sabbath, during the time of communion. This project was\r\ndefeated by the prompt assembling of forces, notwithstanding that Lord\r\nKenmure, with one hundred and fifty-three horsemen, advanced within a\r\nmile and a half of the town, on his march from Moffat. Upon being\r\nadvised of the preparations made for defence, this too prudent commander\r\naddressed his troops, and said, \"that he doubted not there were, in the\r\ntown, as brave gentlemen there as himself, and that he would not go on\r\nto Dumfries that day.\" He returned to Lochmaben, where, on the following\r\nThursday, the Pretender's standard was proclaimed: Lochmaben is a small\r\nmarket-town about fifteen miles from Dumfries; it served for some time\r\nas the head-quarters of the Jacobite party. \"At their approach,\" relates\r\nthe historian of that local insurrection, \"the people of that place had\r\nput their cattle into a fold to make room for their horses; but the\r\nbeasts having broken the fold, some of them drew home to the town a\r\nlittle before day; and a townsman, going to hunt one of 'em out of his\r\nyeard, called on his dog nam'd 'Help.' Hereupon the sentries cried\r\n'Where?' and apprehending it had been a party from Dumfries to attack\r\nthem, gave the alarm to the rebels, who got up in great confusion.\"\r\n\r\nLord Kenmure, attended by the Jacobite chiefs, and Lord Nithisdale, soon\r\nquitted the town of Lochmaben; and proceeding to Ecclefechan, and thence\r\nmarching to Langholme, reached Hawick on the fifteenth of September, and\r\ndetermined on proceeding from that place into Teviotdale. Meantime\r\nmeasures were taken by the Duke of Roxburgh, who was Lieutenant Governor\r\nof Dumfriesshire, to prevent the Castle of Carlaverock being made\r\navailable for the Jacobite forces. The Duke gave orders that the back\r\nbridge of the isle should be taken off, and a communication thus cut off\r\nbetween the Papists in the lower part of Galloway and the rebels in the\r\nborders. The inhabitants of the parish of Carlaverock were also strictly\r\nwatched, being tenants, mostly, of the Earl of Nithisdale; and the same\r\nprecaution was taken with regard to his Lordship's tenantry in Traquair,\r\nTerregles, and Kirkcunyean; yet, according to the statement of Mr. Reay,\r\na most violent partisan against the Jacobites, the humble dwellers on\r\nthese estates were but little disposed to follow their chieftain, who\r\ntook, so the same account declares, \"only two or three domestic servants\r\nwith him.\"[16] This, however, is contradicted by the assertion of Mr.\r\nPatten, who specifies that Lord Nithisdale was followed by three hundred\r\nof his tenantry; and also by the expectations which were founded, upon\r\na close survey and scrutiny, by the agents of the Chevalier before the\r\noutbreak.[17]\r\n\r\nLord Nithisdale had now taken a last farewell of the beautiful and\r\nsmiling country of his forefathers; with what bright hopes, with what\r\nanticipations of a successful march and a triumphant return he may have\r\nquitted Terregles, it is easy to conjecture. Unhappily his enterprise\r\nwas linked to one over which a man, singularly ill-fitted for the office\r\nof command, presided: for it was decreed that the Jacobite forces, under\r\nthe command of Lord Kenmure, should proceed to the assistance of Mr.\r\nForster's ill-fated insurrection in the north of England.\r\n\r\nThe history of that luckless and ill-concerted enterprise has been\r\nalready given.[18] The Earl of Nithisdale was taken prisoner after the\r\nbattle of Preston, but little mention is made of his peculiar services\r\nat that place.\r\n\r\nLord Nithisdale was, with other prisoners of the same rank, removed to\r\nLondon. The prisoners of inferior rank were disposed of, under strong\r\nguards, in the different castles of Lancaster, Chester, and Liverpool.\r\nThe indignities which were wreaked upon the unfortunate Jacobites as\r\nthey entered London have been detailed in the life of Lord Derwentwater.\r\nAmid the cries of a savage populace, and the screams of \"No warming\r\npan,\" \"King George for ever!\" an exclamation which proves how deeply the\r\nnotion of spurious birth had sunk into the minds of the people, the\r\nEarl of Nithisdale was conducted, his arms tied with cords, and the\r\nreins of his horse taken from him, with his unfortunate companions, into\r\nthe Tower. He arrived in London on the 9th of December, 1715.[19]\r\n\r\nOf the manner in which the State prisoners of that period were treated,\r\nthere are sufficient records left to prove that no feeling of compassion\r\nfor what might be deemed a wrong, but yet a generous principle of\r\ndevotion to the Stuarts, no high-toned sentiment of respect to bravery,\r\nnor consideration for the habits and feelings of their prisoners,\r\ninfluenced the British Government during that time of triumph. The mode\r\nin which those unfortunate captives were left in the utmost penury and\r\nnecessity to petition for some provision, after their estates were\r\nescheated, plainly manifests how little there was of that sympathy with\r\ncalamity which marks the present day.[20]\r\n\r\nBut if the State prisoners in London were treated with little humanity,\r\nthose who were huddled together in close prisons at Preston, Chester,\r\nLiverpool, and the other towns were in a still more wretched condition.\r\n\r\nIn the stores of the State Paper Office are to be found heartrending\r\nappeals for mercy, from prisoners sinking under dire diseases from too\r\nclose contiguity, or from long confinement in one apartment. Consumption\r\nseems to have been very prevalent; and in Newgate the gaol fever raged.\r\nFor this rigorous confinement the excuse was, that it had been found\r\nimpossible to give the prisoners air, without risk of escape. In\r\nChester, the townspeople conspired to assist the poor wretches in this\r\nendeavour; and perhaps, in regard to those of meaner rank, the\r\nauthorities were not very averse to the success of such efforts, for the\r\nprisons were crowded, and the expense of even keeping the unfortunate\r\ncaptives alive began to be a source of complaint on the part of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the prisoners of the north were country gentlemen,\r\nRoman Catholics, from Cumberland and Northumberland,--men who were\r\nhearty and sincere in their convictions of the righteousness of their\r\ncause--men, whose ancestors had mustered their tenantry in the field for\r\nCharles the First. To those whose lives were spared, a petition was\r\nrecommended, and taken round for signature, praying that their sentence\r\nof death or of imprisonment might be exchanged for transportation. But,\r\nwhether these high-spirited gentlemen expected that another insurrection\r\nmight act in their favour, or whether they preferred death to a final\r\nfarewell, under circumstances so dreadful, to their country, does not\r\nappear. They mostly refused to sign the petition, which was offered to\r\nthem singly: and the commandant at Preston, Colonel Rapin, in his\r\ncorrespondence with Lord Townshend, expresses his annoyance at their\r\nobstinacy, and expatiates on the inconvenience of the numbers under his\r\ncharge at Preston. At length, after Captain John Dalzell, brother to the\r\nEarl of Carnwath, had signed the petition, a large body of the\r\nprisoners were ordered to be transported without their petitioning, and\r\nto be put in irons. They were hurried away to Liverpool, to embark\r\nthence for the Colonies, gentlemen and private soldiers mingled in one\r\nmass; but orders were afterwards sent by Lord Townshend to detain the\r\ngentlemen. Three hundred and twenty-seven prisoners had, however, been\r\nalready shipped off. Those who remained were not permitted to converse,\r\neven with each other, without risk,--one Thomas Wells being appointed as\r\na spy to write to the Jacobites, and to discourse with them, under the\r\ngarb of friendliness, in order to draw out their real sentiments.[21]\r\n\r\nFrom this digression, which may not be deemed irrelevant, since it marks\r\nthe spirit of the times, we return to the unhappy prisoners in the\r\nTower, which was now thickly tenanted by the fallen Jacobites.\r\n\r\nLord Nithisdale had the sorrow of knowing that many of his friends and\r\nkinsmen were in the same gloomy and impenetrable fortress to which he\r\nhad been conducted. It is possible that the Jacobite noblemen were not\r\nhopeless; and that remembering the clemency of William the Third to\r\nthose who had held a treasonable correspondence with the Court of St.\r\nGermains, they might look for a similar line of policy from the reigning\r\nmonarch.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged, however, that Government had been greatly\r\nexasperated by acts of violence and of wanton destruction on the part of\r\nthe Jacobites throughout the country; and that the general disaffection\r\nthroughout the North, and, in particular, the strong Tory predilections\r\nat Oxford, must have greatly aggravated the dangers, and consequently,\r\nin a political view, have enhanced the crimes of the Chevalier's\r\nadherents. \"The country,\" writes Colonel Rapin to Lord Townshend, \"is\r\nfull of them [the Jacobites], and the same spirit reigns in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oxford,\" writes an informant, under the name of _Philopoliticus_, \"is\r\ndebauched by Jacobitism. They call the Parliament the Rump; and riots in\r\nthe street, with cries of 'Down with the Rump!' occur daily.\" Even the\r\nfellows and heads of the colleges were disposed to Jacobite opinions;\r\nand the Jacobites had expected that the city would become the\r\nChevalier's head-quarters as it had been that of Charles the First.[22]\r\n\r\nBut that which hastened the fate of the Earl of Nithisdale and of his\r\nfriends, was the landing of James Stuart, at Peterhead, in Scotland, on\r\nthe twenty-second of December,--an event which took place too late for\r\nhis friends and partisans, and fatally increased the calamities of those\r\nwho had suffered in his cause. On Monday, the ninth of January, he made\r\nhis public entry into Perth, and, on the same day, the reigning monarch\r\naddressed his Parliament.[23]\r\n\r\n\"Among the many unavoidable ill consequences of this Rebellion,\" said\r\nthe King, \"none affects me more sensibly than that extraordinary burden\r\nwhich it has, and must, create to my faithful subjects. To ease them as\r\nfar as lies in my power, I take this first opportunity of declaring that\r\nI freely give up all the estates that shall become forfeited to the\r\nCrown by this Rebellion, to be applied towards defraying the\r\nextraordinary expense incurred on this occasion.\" As soon as a suitable\r\naddress had been returned by both Houses, a debate concerning the\r\nprisoners taken in rebellion ensued, and a conference was determined on\r\nwith the House of Lords. Mr. Lechmere, who was named to carry up the\r\nmessage to the Lords, returned, and made a long and memorable speech,\r\nconcerning the rise, depth, and extent of the Rebellion; after which it\r\nwas resolved, _nemine contradicente_, to impeach the Earl of\r\nDerwentwater, William Lord Widdrington, William Earl of Nithisdale,\r\nRobert Earl of Carnwath, George Earl of Wintoun, William Viscount\r\nKenmure, and William Lord Nairn, of high treason.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, a committee was appointed to draw up articles of\r\nimpeachment; and so great was the dispatch used, and so zealous were the\r\ncommittee, that in two hours the articles were prepared, agreed to, and\r\nordered to be engrossed with the usual saving clause. During this time,\r\nthe Lords remained sitting, and before ten o'clock the articles were\r\npresented before that assembly.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the prisoners were conducted before the Bar of the\r\nHouse, where the articles of impeachment were read to them, and they\r\nwere desired to prepare their replies on the sixteenth day of the month.\r\nThus only six days were allowed for their answers; upon application,\r\nhowever, two days more were granted. The prisoners were allowed to\r\nchoose counsel, and also to have a free communication with any persons,\r\neither peers or commoners, whom they might name.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first of January, the King again addressed his Parliament,\r\nand referred to the recent landing of the \"Pretender\" in Scotland. The\r\nreply of the two Houses to this speech emphatically declares, \"that the\r\nlanding of the Pretender hath increased their indignation against him\r\nand his adherents, and that they were determined to do everything in\r\ntheir power to assist his Majesty, not only in subduing the present\r\nRebellion, but in destroying the seeds and causes of it, that the like\r\ndisturbance may never rise again to impair the blessings of his\r\nMajesty's reign.\"[24]\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of February the six impeached lords were brought, at eleven\r\nin the morning, to the Court erected in Westminster Hall, wherein both\r\nLords and Commons were assembled. The ceremonial of opening this\r\ncelebrated Court was conducted in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nThe Lords being placed on their proper seats, and the Lord High Steward\r\non the woolsack, the Clerk of the Crown in the Court of Chancery, after\r\nmaking three reverences to the Lord Steward, presented, on his knees,\r\nthe King's commission; which, after the usual reverences, was placed on\r\nthe table. A proclamation for silence was then heard. The High Steward\r\nstood up and addressed the Peers, \"His Majesty's commission is going to\r\nbe read; your Lordships are desired to attend.\"\r\n\r\nThe Peers hereupon arose, uncovered themselves, and stood while the\r\ncommission was being read. The voice of the Sergeant-at-arms exclaimed,\r\n\"God save the King!\" The Herald and Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod,\r\nafter three reverences, kneeling, then presented the White Staff to his\r\nGrace, the High Steward; upon which his Grace, attended by the Herald,\r\nthe Black Rod, and Seal Bearer, removed from the woolsack to an armed\r\nchair which was placed on the uppermost step but one next to the throne.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk of the Crown ordered the Serjeant-at-arms to make another\r\nproclamation for silence; and amidst the stillness, the Lieutenant of\r\nthe Tower brought in, amid an assembly of their compeers, his prisoners.\r\nLord Wintoun was alone absent; for he had obtained a few days of\r\ndelay.[25]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Nithisdale pleaded guilty, with his companions in\r\nmisfortune. On Thursday, the nineteenth of January, when called upon for\r\nhis answer, his defence was couched in the following terms: \"It is with\r\nthe greatest confusion,\" he began, \"the said Earl appears at your\r\nLordships' Bar, under the weight of an impeachment by the Commons of\r\nGreat Britain for high treason.\" He went on to declare that he had ever\r\nbeen a zealous assertor of the liberties of his country, and never\r\nengaged in any design to subvert the established Government and good\r\nlaws of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nWhen summoned by those who were entrusted with the administration of the\r\ngovernment in Scotland to Edinburgh, he did, he alleged, not obey the\r\nsummons, being assured that if he went thither he would be made a close\r\nprisoner. He was therefore forced to abscond; for being at that time in\r\nill-health, a confinement in Edinburgh Castle would have endangered his\r\nlife. The Earl also stated that he had remained in privacy, until\r\nseveral of the persons mentioned in the impeachment had appeared in arms\r\nvery near the place where they had lain concealed. He then\r\n\"inconsiderately and unfortunately\" joined them, with four domestics\r\nonly, and proceeded in their company to the places named in the\r\nindictment; but knew nothing of the intended insurrection until the\r\nparty \"were actually in arms.\" After some expressions, stating that he\r\nwas deeply sensible of his offence, he confessed, with \"a sorrow equal\r\nto his crime,\" that he was guilty; \"but referred to his hopes of mercy,\r\ngrounded on his having capitulated at Preston, where he performed the\r\nduty of a Christian in preventing effusion of blood; and on his reliance\r\non his Majesty's mercy.\"\r\n\r\nOn being further asked by the Lord High Steward whether he had anything\r\nto say \"why judgment should not pass upon him according to law,\" Lord\r\nNithisdale recapitulated the points in his answer in so weak a voice,\r\nthat the Lord Steward reiterated the former question: \"Have you pleaded\r\nanything in arrest of judgment?\" \"No, my Lord, I have not,\" was the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Nithisdale received the sentence of condemnation with the\r\nother Lords; and, like them, had the misery of hearing his doom prefaced\r\nby a long and admired harangue. The sentence was then pronounced in all\r\nits barbarous particularities; the law being in this, as the Lord High\r\nSteward declared, deaf to all distinctions of rank, \"required that he\r\nshould pronounce them.\" But his Grace intimated the most ignominious and\r\npainful parts of the sentence were usually remitted.\r\n\r\nLord Nithisdale, unlike Lord Widdrington and Lord Kenmure, who had\r\nreferred in terms of anguish to their wives and children, had made no\r\nappeal on the plea of those family ties, to which few of his judges\r\ncould have been insensible. He returned to the Tower, under sentence of\r\ndeath, to be saved by the heroism of a woman; according to some\r\naccounts, of his mother;[26] but actually, by the fearless, devoted\r\naffection of his wife.\r\n\r\nWinifred, Countess of Nithisdale, appears, from her portrait by Kneller,\r\nto have conjoined to an heroic contempt of danger a feminine and\r\ndelicate appearance, with great loveliness of countenance.[27] She was\r\ndescended from a family who knew no prouder recollection than that\r\ntheir castle-towers had been the last to welcome the unhappy Charles the\r\nFirst in the manner suited to royalty. Her mother was the Lady Elizabeth\r\nHerbert, daughter of Edward, the second Marquis of Worcester, and author\r\nof \"The Century of Inventions.\" Lady Nithisdale was therefore the\r\ngreat-granddaughter of that justly honoured Marquis of Worcester whose\r\nloyalty and disinterestedness were features of a character as excellent\r\nin private life, as benevolent, as sincere, as it was conspicuous in his\r\npublic career. Yet, so universal, so continual has been the popular\r\nprejudice against Popery in this country, that even the virtues of this\r\ngood man could scarcely rescue him from the imputation, as Lord\r\nClarendon expresses it, of being \"that sort of Catholics, the people\r\nrendered odious, by accusing to be most Jesuited.\"\r\n\r\nThe maternal family of Lady Nithisdale were, therefore, of the same\r\nfaith with her husband, and, like his family, they had suffered deeply\r\nfor the cause of the Stuarts; and it is remarkable that, with what some\r\nmight deem infatuation, many descendants of those who had seen their\r\nfairest possessions ravaged, their friends and kindred slain, should be\r\nready to suffer again. It is impossible for any reasoning to dispel the\r\nidea that this must be a true and fixed principle, independent, in many\r\nnoble instances, of the hope of reward,--a far less enduring motive, and\r\none which would be apt to change with every change of fortune.\r\n\r\nLady Nithisdale, on her father's side, was descended from the Herberts\r\nof Powis Castle, who were ennobled in the reign of James the First. She\r\nwas the fourth daughter of William, Marquis of Powis, who followed James\r\nthe Second, after his abdication, to France, and was created by that\r\nmonarch Duke of Powis, a title not recognised in England.[28] The\r\ntitular Duke of Powis, as he is frequently called in history, chose to\r\nremain at St. Germains, and was at length outlawed for not returning\r\nwithin a certain period. He died at St. Germains in 1696. Upon the death\r\nof her father, Lady Winifred Herbert was placed with her elder sister,\r\nthe Lady Lucy, in the English convent at Bruges, of which Lady Lucy\r\neventually became Abbess. A less severe fate was, however, in store for\r\nthe younger sister.\r\n\r\nUnder these adverse circumstances, so far as related to the proper\r\nmaintenance of her father's rank in England, was Winifred Herbert\r\nreared. How and where she met with Lord Nithisdale, and whether the\r\nstrong attachment which afterwards united them so indissolubly, was\r\nnurtured in the saloons of St. Germains, or in the romantic haunts of\r\nNithisdale, we have no information to decide, neither have the\r\ndescendants of the family been able even to ascertain the date of her\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable, however, that, before his marriage, Lord\r\nNithisdale visited Paris and Rome, since the practice of making what was\r\ncalled \"the grand tour\" not only prevailed among the higher classes, but\r\nespecially among the Jacobite nobility, many of whom, as in the case of\r\nLord Derwentwater, were educated abroad; and this is more especially\r\nlikely to have been the case in the instance of Lord Nithisdale, since,\r\nas Lady Nithisdale remarks in her narrative, her husband was a Roman\r\nCatholic in a part of Scotland peculiarly adverse to that faith, \"the\r\nonly support,\" as she calls him, \"of the Catholics against the\r\ninveteracy of the Whigs, who were very numerous in that part of\r\nScotland.\"\r\n\r\nIn her participation of those decided political opinions, which were\r\ninbred in Lady Nithisdale, she appears not to have departed from that\r\nfeminine character which rises to sublimity when coupled with a fearless\r\nsacrifice of selfish considerations. It was the custom of the day for\r\nladies to share in the intrigues of faction, more or less. Lady\r\nFauconbridge, the Countess of Derwentwater, Lady Seaforth, all appear to\r\nhave taken a lively part in the interests of the Jacobites. The Duchess\r\nof Marlborough was, politically speaking, extinct; but the restless love\r\nof ascendancy is never extinct. The fashionable world were still\r\ndivided between her, and the rival whom she so despised, Catherine\r\nSedley, Duchess of Buckingham.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Nithisdale, living in the North, and possibly occupied with her\r\ntwo children, remained, as she affirms, in the country, until the\r\nintelligence of her lord's committal to the Tower brought her from her\r\nseclusion years afterwards; she writes thus to her sister, the Lady Lucy\r\nHerbert, Abbess of the English Augustine Nuns at Bruges, who had, it\r\nseems, requested from her an account of the circumstances under which\r\nLord Nithisdale escaped from the Tower.\r\n\r\n\"I first came to London,\" Lady Nithisdale writes, \"upon hearing that my\r\nlord was committed to the Tower. I was at the same time informed that he\r\nhad expressed the greatest anxiety to see me, having, as he afterwards\r\ntold me, no one to console him till I came. I rode to Newcastle, and\r\nfrom thence took the stage to York. When I arrived there, the snow was\r\nso deep that the stage could not set out for London. The season was so\r\nsevere, and the roads so bad, that the post itself was stopped: however,\r\nI took horses and rode to London, though the snow was generally above\r\nthe horses' girths and arrived safe without any accident.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this perilous journey, the determined woman sought interviews with\r\nthe reigning Ministers, but she met with no encouragement; on the\r\ncontrary, she was assured that, although some of the prisoners were to\r\nbe saved, Lord Nithisdale would not be of the number.\r\n\r\n\"When I inquired,\" she continues, \"into the reason of this distinction,\r\nI could obtain no other answer than that they would not flatter me. But\r\nI soon perceived the reasons, which they declined alleging me. A Roman\r\nCatholic upon the frontiers of Scotland, who headed a very considerable\r\nparty, a man whose family had always signalized itself by its loyalty to\r\nthe royal house of Stuart, would,\" she argued, \"become a very agreeable\r\nsacrifice to the opposite party. They still,\" so thought Lady\r\nNithisdale, \"remembered the defence of the castle of Carlaverock against\r\nthe republicans by Lord Nithisdale's grandfather, and were resolved not\r\nto let his grandson escape from their power.\"\r\n\r\nUpon weighing all these considerations, Lady Nithisdale perceived that\r\nall hope of mercy was vain; she determined to dismiss all such\r\ndependance from her mind, and to confide in her own efforts. It was not\r\nimpossible to bribe the guards who were set over the state prisoners:\r\nindeed, from the number of escapes, there must either have been a very\r\nvenal spirit among the people who had the charge of the prisoners\r\ngenerally, or a compassionate leaning in their favour.\r\n\r\nHaving formed her resolution, Lady Nithisdale decided to communicate it\r\nto no one, except to her \"dear Evans,\" a maid, or companion, who was of\r\nparamount assistance to her in the whole affair.\r\n\r\nMeantime, public indications of compassion for the condemned lords,\r\nseemed to offer better hopes than the dangerous enterprise of effecting\r\nan escape.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of February, orders were sent both to the Lieutenant\r\nof the Tower and to the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex for the\r\nexecutions of the rebel lords.[29] Great solicitations had, meantime,\r\nbeen made for them, and the petitions for mercy not only reached the\r\nCourt, but came down to the two Houses of Parliament, and being seconded\r\nby some members, debates ensued. That in the Commons ended in a motion\r\nfor an adjournment, carried by a majority of seven only, and intended to\r\navoid any further interposition in that House. Many who used to vote\r\nwith the Government, influenced, says a contemporary writer, by \"the\r\nword _mercy_, voted with the contrary party.\" In the House of Peers,\r\nhowever, the question being put, whether the petitions should be\r\nreceived and read, it was carried by a majority of nine or ten voices.\r\n\r\nBut the sanguine hopes of those who were hanging upon the decisions of\r\nthe Lords for life or death, were again cruelly disappointed. After\r\nreading the petitions, the next question was, whether in case of an\r\nimpeachment, the King had power to reprieve? This was carried by an\r\naffirmative, and followed by a motion to address his Majesty, humbly to\r\ndesire him to reprieve the lords who lay under sentence of death. These\r\nrelentings, and the successive tides of feeling displayed in this high\r\nassembly, prove how divided the higher classes were on the points of\r\nhereditary monarchy, and others also at issue; but the Whig ascendancy\r\nprevailed. There was a clause introduced into the address, which\r\nnullified all former show of mercy; and the King was merely petitioned\r\n\"to reprieve such of the condemned lords as deserve his mercy; and that\r\nthe time of the respite should be left to his Majesty's discretion.\"\r\nThis clause was carried by five votes only.\r\n\r\nTo the address the following inauspicious answer was returned from King\r\nGeorge: \"That on this, and other occasions, he would do what he thought\r\nmost consistent with the dignity of his Crown, and the safety of his\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nThis struggle between the parties ended, says the author of the\r\nRegister, \"in the execution of two of these condemned lords, and the\r\nremoval of some others from their employments, that had been most\r\nsolicitous for their preservation.\"\r\n\r\nThe objects of this petty tyranny could well afford to succumb under the\r\nworkings of that mean and revengeful spirit, whilst they might cherish\r\nthe conviction of having used their efforts in the true spirit of that\r\nChristianity which remembers no considerations of worldly interest, when\r\nopposed to duty. Lady Nithisdale's relation of this anxious and eventful\r\nday, the twenty-third of February, is far too animated to be changed in\r\na single expression. She had refused to remain confined with Lord\r\nNithisdale in the Tower, on the plea of infirm health; but actually,\r\nbecause she well knew that she could better aid his cause whilst herself\r\nat liberty. She was then forbidden to see her husband; but by bribing\r\nthe guards, she often contrived to have secret interviews with him,\r\nuntil the day before that on which the prisoners were condemned.\r\n\r\n\"On the twenty-second of February, which fell on a Thursday, our general\r\npetition was presented to the House of Lords, the purport of which was\r\nto interest the Lords to intercede with his Majesty to pardon the\r\nprisoners. We were, however, disappointed. The day before the petition\r\nwas to be presented, the Duke of St. Albans, who had promised my Lady\r\nDerwentwater to present it, when it came to the point, failed in his\r\nword. However, as she was the only English Countess concerned, it was\r\nincumbent on her to have it presented. We had but one day left before\r\nthe execution, and the Duke still promised to present the petition; but\r\nfor fear he should fail, I engaged the Duke of Montrose to secure its\r\nbeing done by one or the other. I then went in company with most of the\r\nladies of quality then in town, to solicit the interest of the Lords as\r\nthey were going to the House. They all behaved to me with great\r\ncivility, but particularly the Earl of Pembroke, who, though he desired\r\nme not to speak to him, yet he promised to employ his interest in my\r\nfavour, and honourably kept his word, for he spoke very strongly in our\r\nbehalf.\"[30]\r\n\r\n\"The subject of the debate was, whether the King had the power to pardon\r\nthose who had been condemned by Parliament: and it was chiefly owing to\r\nLord Pembroke's speech that it was carried in the affirmative. However,\r\none of the Lords stood up and said that the House could only intercede\r\nfor those who should prove themselves worthy of their intercession, but\r\nnot for all of them indiscriminately. This salvo quite blasted all my\r\nhopes, for I was assured that it was aimed at the exclusion of those who\r\nshould refuse to subscribe to the petition, which was a thing I knew my\r\nlord would never submit to; nor, in fact, could I wish to preserve his\r\nlife on those terms. As the motion had passed generally, I thought I\r\ncould draw from it some advantage in favour of my design. Accordingly I\r\nimmediately left the House of Lords, and hastened to the Tower, where,\r\naffecting an air of joy and satisfaction, I told the guards I passed by,\r\nthat I came to bring joyful tidings to the prisoners. I desired them to\r\nlay aside their fears, for the petition had passed the House in their\r\nfavour. I then gave them some money to drink to the Lords and his\r\nMajesty, though it was trifling; for I thought if I were too liberal on\r\nthe occasion, they might suspect my designs, and that giving them\r\nsomething would gain their good will and services for the next day,\r\nwhich was the eve of the execution.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day Lady Nithisdale was too much occupied in\r\npreparations for her scheme to visit the Tower; the evening of the\r\neventful twenty-third of February arrived; and when all things were put\r\nin readiness, this resolute and well-judging woman threw herself upon\r\nthe confidence of one in whose power she was, to a certain degree, and\r\nwhose co-operation she could only secure by such a proceeding. She sent\r\nfor the landlady of the house in which she lodged, and told her that she\r\nhad made up her mind to effect Lord Nithisdale's escape, since there was\r\nno chance of his being pardoned. She added those few but thrilling\r\nwords: \"This is the last night before his execution!\" While she spoke,\r\nperhaps, the condemned nobleman was supplicating on his knees to God for\r\nthat mercy which was withheld by man. Imagination paints the despondency\r\nof Lord Derwentwater; the calm and dignified sorrow of the justly pitied\r\nKenmure.\r\n\r\nLady Nithisdale then made a request calculated to alarm a woman of an\r\nordinary character; but she seems to have understood the disposition of\r\nthe person whom she thus addressed.\r\n\r\n    \"I told her that I had every thing in readiness, and that I trusted\r\n    she would not refuse to accompany me, that my lord might pass for\r\n    her. I pressed her to come immediately, as we had no time to lose.\"\r\n    This sudden announcement, which a less sagacious mind might have\r\n    deemed injudicious, had the effect which Lady Nithisdale expected;\r\n    the undertaking was one of such risk, that it could only be an\r\n    enterprise of impulse, except to her whose affections were deeply\r\n    interested in the result. The consent of Mrs. Mills was carried by\r\n    storm, as well as that of another coadjutor, a Mrs. Morgan, who\r\n    usually bore the name of Hilton, to whom Lady Nithisdale dispatched\r\n    a messenger, begging her to come immediately. \"Their surprise and\r\n    astonishment,\" remarks Lady Nithisdale, speaking of these, her two\r\n    confidantes, \"made them consent, without ever thinking of the\r\n    consequences.\" The scheme was, that Mrs. Mills, who was tall and\r\n    portly, should pass for Lord Nithisdale; Mrs. Morgan was to carry\r\n    concealed the bundle of \"clothes that were to serve Mrs. Mills when\r\n    she left her own behind her.\" After certain other preparations, all\r\n    managed with infinite dexterity and shrewdness, these three heroines\r\n    set out in a coach for the Tower, into which they were to be\r\n    admitted, under the plea of taking a last leave of Lord Nithisdale.\r\n    Lady Nithisdale, even whilst her heart throbbed with agitation,\r\n    continued to support her spirits. \"When we were in the coach;\" she\r\n    relates, \"I never ceased talking, that they her companions might\r\n    have no leisure to repent.\r\n\r\n    \"On our arrival at the Tower, the first I introduced was Mrs. Morgan\r\n    (for I was only allowed to take in one at a time). She brought in\r\n    the clothes which were to serve Mrs. Mills when she left her own\r\n    behind her. When Mrs. Morgan had taken off what she had brought for\r\n    my purpose, I conducted her back to the staircase; and in going I\r\n    begged her to send my maid to dress me, that I was afraid of being\r\n    too late to present my last petition that night if she did not come\r\n    immediately. I dispatched her safe, and went partly down stairs to\r\n    meet Mrs. Mills, who had the precaution to hold her handkerchief to\r\n    her face, as is natural for a woman to do when she is going to take\r\n    her last farewell of a friend on the eve of his execution. I had\r\n    indeed desired her to do so, that my lord might go out in the same\r\n    manner. Her eyebrows were rather inclined to be sandy, and my lord's\r\n    were very dark and very thick. However, I had prepared some paint of\r\n    the colour of hers, to disguise his with; I also brought an\r\n    artificial head-dress of the same coloured hair as hers, and I\r\n    painted his face and his cheeks with rouge to hide his long beard,\r\n    which he had not had time to shave.\r\n\r\n    \"All this provision I had before left in the Tower. The poor guards,\r\n    whom my slight liberality the day before had endeared me to, let me\r\n    go quietly out with my company, and were not so strictly on the\r\n    watch as they usually had been; and the more so, as they were\r\n    persuaded, from what I had told them the day before, that the\r\n    prisoners would obtain their pardon. I made Mrs. Mills take off her\r\n    own hood, and put on that which I had brought for her. I then took\r\n    her by the hand and led her out of my lord's chamber; and in passing\r\n    through the next room, in which were several people, with all the\r\n    concern imaginable I said, 'My dear Mrs. Catherine, go in all haste,\r\n    and send me my waiting-maid; she certainly cannot reflect how late\r\n    it is. I am to present my petition to-night, and if I let slip this\r\n    opportunity I am undone, for to-morrow is too late. Hasten her as\r\n    much as possible, for I shall be on thorns till she comes.'\r\n    Everybody in the room, who were chiefly the guards' wives and\r\n    daughters, seemed to compassionate me exceedingly, and the sentinel\r\n    officiously opened me the door. When I had seen her safe out, I\r\n    returned to my lord and finished dressing him. I had taken care that\r\n    Mrs. Mills did not go out crying, as she came in, that my lord might\r\n    better pass for the lady who came in crying and afflicted; and the\r\n    more so, as he had the same dress that she wore. When I had almost\r\n    finished dressing my lord in all my petticoats except one, I\r\n    perceived it was growing dark, and was afraid that the light of the\r\n    candles might betray us, so I resolved to set off. I went out\r\n    leading him by the hand, whilst he held his handkerchief to his\r\n    eyes. I spoke to him in the most piteous and afflicted tone,\r\n    bewailing bitterly the negligence of Evans, who had ruined me by her\r\n    delay. Then I said, 'My dear Mrs. Betty, for the love of God, run\r\n    quickly and bring her with you; you know my lodging, and if you ever\r\n    made dispatch in your life, do it at present: I am almost distracted\r\n    with this disappointment.' The guards opened the door, and I went\r\n    down stairs with him, still conjuring him to make all possible\r\n    dispatch. As soon as he had cleared the door I made him walk before\r\n    me, for fear the sentinel should take notice of his walk, but I\r\n    continued to press him to make all the dispatch he possibly could.\r\n    At the bottom of the stairs I met my dear Evans, into whose hands I\r\n    confided him. I had before engaged Mr. Mills to be in readiness\r\n    before the Tower to conduct him to some place of safety, in case we\r\n    succeeded. He looked upon the affair as so very improbable to\r\n    succeed, that his astonishment, when he saw us, threw him into such\r\n    a consternation that he was almost out of himself; which Evans\r\n    perceiving, with the greatest presence of mind, without telling him\r\n    anything, lest he should mistrust them, conducted him to some of her\r\n    own friends on whom she could rely, and so secured him, without\r\n    which we certainly should have been undone. When she had conducted\r\n    him and left him with them, she returned to Mr. Mills, who had by\r\n    this time recovered himself from his astonishment. They went home\r\n    together; and having found a place of security, they conducted him\r\n    to it. In the mean time, as I had pretended to have sent the young\r\n    lady on a message, I was obliged to return up stairs and go back to\r\n    my lord's room in the same feigned anxiety of being too late, so\r\n    that everybody seemed sincerely to sympathise in my distress. When I\r\n    was in the room, I talked as if he had been really present. I\r\n    answered my own questions in my lord's voice, as nearly as I could\r\n    imitate it. I walked up and down as if we were conversing together,\r\n    till I thought they had time enough thoroughly to clear themselves\r\n    of the guards. I then thought proper to make off also. I opened the\r\n    door and stood half in it, that those in the outward chamber might\r\n    hear what I said, but held it so close that they could not look in.\r\n    I bade my lord formal farewell for the night, and added, that\r\n    something more than usual must have happened to make Evans\r\n    negligent on this important occasion, who had always been so\r\n    punctual in the smallest trifles, that I saw no other remedy than to\r\n    go in person. That if the Tower was then open, when I had finished\r\n    my business, I would return that night; but that he might be assured\r\n    I would be with him as early in the morning as I could gain\r\n    admittance into the Tower, and I flattered myself I should bring\r\n    more favourable news. Then, before I shut the door, I pulled through\r\n    the string of the latch, so that it could only be opened in the\r\n    inside.\r\n\r\n    \"I then shut it with some degree of force, that I might be sure of\r\n    its being well shut. I said to the servant as I passed by (who was\r\n    ignorant of the whole transaction), that he need not carry in\r\n    candles to his master till my lord sent for them, as he desired to\r\n    finish some prayers first.\"[31]\r\n\r\nThus ended this singular, successful, and heroic scheme. It was now\r\nnecessary that the devoted Lady Nithisdale should secure her own safety.\r\n\r\nShe had, it seems, been bent upon proffering a last petition to King\r\nGeorge, in case her attempt had failed. She drove home to her lodgings,\r\nwhere a friend, named Mackenzie, waited to take her petition. \"There is\r\nno need of a petition,\" were the words that broke from the agitated\r\nwoman; \"my lord is safe, and out of the Tower, and out of the hands of\r\nhis enemies, though I know not where he is.\" Lady Nithisdale then\r\ndischarged the coach which had brought her to her lodgings, a precaution\r\nwhich she always observed for fear of being traced,--never going in the\r\nsame vehicle to more than one place. She sent for a chair, and went to\r\nthe Duchess of Buccleugh, who had promised to present her petition,\r\nhaving taken her precaution against all events. The Duchess expected\r\nher, but had company with her; and Lady Nithisdale barely escaped being\r\nshown into the room where her friend was with her company. She, however,\r\nexcused herself, and, sending a message to her Grace, proceeded to the\r\nresidence of the Duchess of Montrose. \"This lady had ever,\" said Lady\r\nNithisdale, \"borne a part in my distresses;\" she now left her company to\r\nsee and console the wife of the rebel lord, of whom, she conjectured,\r\nLady Nithisdale must have taken, that night, a last farewell. As the two\r\nfriends met, the Duchess, to her astonishment, found her visitor in a\r\ntransport of joy; \"she was extremely shocked and frightened,\" writes\r\nLady Nithisdale; \"and has since confessed to me that she thought my\r\ntroubles had driven me out of myself.\" She cautioned Lady Nithisdale to\r\nsecrecy, and even to flight; for the King had been extremely irritated\r\nby the petition already sent in by Lady Nithisdale. The generous Duchess\r\nwas, among those who frequented the Court, the only person that knew\r\nLady Nithisdale's secret. After a brief interview, Lady Nithisdale,\r\nsending for a fresh chair, hurried away to a house which her faithful\r\nattendant Evans had found for her, and where she was to learn tidings of\r\nLord Nithisdale. Here she learned that Lord Nithisdale had been removed\r\nfrom the lodging to which he had at first been conducted, to the mean\r\nabode of a poor woman just opposite the guard-house. Here the former\r\nLord of Carlaverock and of Nithisdale met his wife. Lady Nithisdale\r\nhurries over the meeting, but her simple account has its own powers of\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe good woman of the house had, it seems, but one small room up a pair\r\nof stairs, and a very small bed in it. \"We threw ourselves on the bed\r\nthat we might not be heard walking up and down. She left us a bottle of\r\nwine and some bread, and Mrs. Mills brought us some more in her pockets\r\nthe next day. We subsisted on this provision from Thursday till Saturday\r\nnight, when Mr. Mills came and conducted my lord to the Venetian\r\nAmbassador's. We did not communicate the affair to his Excellency, but\r\none of the servants concealed him in his own room till Wednesday, on\r\nwhich day the Ambassador's coach-and-six was to go down to Dover to meet\r\nhis brother. My lord put on a livery, and went down in the retinue,\r\nwithout the least suspicion, to Dover; where Mr. Michel (which was the\r\nname of the Ambassador's servant) hired a small vessel, and immediately\r\nset sail for Calais. The passage was so remarkably short, that the\r\ncaptain threw out this reflection,--that the wind could not have served\r\nbetter if the passengers had been flying for their lives, little\r\nthinking it to be really the case.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Michel might have easily returned without suspicion of being\r\nconcerned in my lord's escape; but my lord seemed inclined to have him\r\nwith him, which he did, and he has at present a good place under our\r\nyoung master. This is an exact and as full an account of this affair,\r\nand of the persons concerned in it, as I could possibly give you, to the\r\nbest of my memory, and you may rely upon the truth of it. For my part, I\r\nabsconded to the house of a very honest man in Drury Lane, where I\r\nremained till I was assured of my lord's safe arrival on the Continent.\r\nI then wrote to the Duchess of Buccleugh (everybody thought till then\r\nthat I was gone off with my lord) to tell her that I understood I was\r\nsuspected of having contrived my lord's escape, as was very natural to\r\nsuppose; that if I could have been happy enough to have done it, I\r\nshould be flattered to have the merit of it attributed to me; but that a\r\nbare suspicion without proof, would never be a sufficient ground for my\r\nbeing punished for a supposed offence, though it might be motive\r\nsufficient for me to provide a place of security; so I entreated her to\r\nprocure leave for me to go about my business. So far from granting my\r\nrequest, they were resolved to secure me if possible. After several\r\ndebates, Mr. Solicitor-General, who was an utter stranger to me, had the\r\nhumanity to say, that since I showed such respect to Government as not\r\nto appear in public, it would be cruel to make any search after me.\r\nUpon which it was resolved that no further search should be made if I\r\nremained concealed; but that if I appeared either in England or\r\nScotland, I should be secured. But this was not sufficient for me,\r\nunless I could submit to see my son exposed to beggary. My lord sent for\r\nme up to town in such haste, that I had not time to settle anything\r\nbefore I left Scotland. I had in my hand all the family papers, and I\r\ndared trust them to nobody: my house might have been searched without\r\nwarning, consequently they were far from being secure there. In this\r\ndistress, I had the precaution to bury them in the ground, and nobody\r\nbut myself and the gardener knew where they were. I did the same with\r\nother things of value. The event proved that I had acted prudently; for\r\nafter my departure they searched the house, and God only knows what\r\nmight have transpired from those papers! All these circumstances\r\nrendered my presence absolutely necessary, otherwise they might have\r\nbeen lost; for though they retained the highest preservation after one\r\nvery severe winter, (for when I took them up they were as dry as if they\r\ncame from the fire-side,) yet they could not possibly have remained so\r\nmuch longer without prejudice.\"\r\n\r\nLord Nithisdale went to Rome, and never revisited his native country;\r\nindeed, the project of the Rebellion of 1745, and the unceasing efforts\r\nand hopes by which it was preceded on the part of the Jacobites, must\r\nhave rendered such a step impracticable to one who seems to have been\r\nespecially obnoxious to the house of Hanover.\r\n\r\nHis escape, according to Lady Nithisdale, both infuriated and alarmed\r\nGeorge the First, \"who flew into an excessive passion,\" as she expresses\r\nit, on the news transpiring; and exclaimed that he was betrayed, and\r\nthat it could not have been done without a confederacy. He instantly\r\ndispatched messengers to the Tower, to give orders that the prisoners\r\nwho were still there, might be the more effectually secured. He never\r\nforgave Lady Nithisdale; and the effects of his powerful resentment were\r\nsuch, as eventually to drive her for ever from England.\r\n\r\nInexperienced, young, a stranger in the vast metropolis, Lady Nithisdale\r\nwas now left alone, to skulk from place to place that she might avoid\r\nthe effects of the royal displeasure. She absconded to the house of an\r\n\"honest man\" in Drury Lane, where she remained in concealment until she\r\nheard of her husband's safe arrival on the Continent. A report,\r\nmeantime, prevailed of her having been the means of Lord Nithisdale's\r\nescape; and it was generally believed that she had gone with him. To the\r\nsurprise of the Duchess of Buccleugh, Lady Nithisdale one day appeared\r\nbefore her, the object of that sudden and perhaps undesired visit being\r\nto obtain, by the influence of the Duchess, leave to quit London; and to\r\ndisseminate, through her Grace, a belief that the safety of Lord\r\nNithisdale was not procured by his wife's means. It must have been one\r\nof the most aggravating circumstances to that noble and affectionate\r\nbeing, to have employed so much artifice in the conduct of this affair;\r\nbut, if ever artifice be allowable, it is when opposed as a weapon to\r\ntyranny. Besides, Lady Nithisdale had now not only her own safety to\r\nconsider; she had to protect the interests of her son.\r\n\r\nThose whom she had mortally offended were eager to punish her courage by\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe Solicitor-General, however, showed a more compassionate spirit than\r\nhis employers, and in the course of several debates in the House of\r\nCommons, submitted that if Lady Nithisdale paid so much respect to\r\nGovernment as not to appear in public, it would be cruel to make any\r\nfarther search after her. It was therefore decided that unless the lady\r\nwere seen in England or Scotland, she should be unmolested; but if she\r\nwere observed in either of those countries, she should be secured. This\r\nmight be a decision of mercy, but Lady Nithisdale could not submit to\r\nit, unless she left her son's estate to be ruined by waste and plunder.\r\nHurried as she had been to London, she had found time only to make one\r\narrangement, which proved to be of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\n\"I had in my hands,\" she relates, \"all the family papers, and dared\r\ntrust them to nobody. My house might have been searched without warning,\r\nconsequently they were far from being secure there. In this distress I\r\nhad the precaution to bury them in the ground, and nobody but myself and\r\nthe gardener knew where they were: I did the same with other things of\r\nvalue. The event proved that I had acted prudently to save these\r\npapers.\"\r\n\r\nLady Nithisdale determined to return, at all risks, to Scotland; and it\r\nwas, perhaps, from her care in concealing the important documents to\r\nwhich she refers, that the estates were not escheated. She soon put into\r\nexecution the heroic determination, of which she made no boast. Her\r\njourney was full of perils; not only those incident to the time and\r\nseason of the year, but the great risk of being betrayed and discovered.\r\nLittle respect was paid, in that reign, when truly the spirit of\r\nchivalry was extinguished, to the weaker sex. Ladies, active and\r\ninstrumental as they were in political intrigues, if found out, were\r\nmade to pay the penalty of their dissaffection with hard imprisonment;\r\nor, if at large, wandered from place to place, conscious that the eye of\r\nthe law pursued their footsteps. Lady Seaforth, the wife of one of the\r\nrebel lords, was reduced to necessity, even of the common necessaries of\r\nlife; and Lady Widdrington and her children shared the same cruel\r\nprivations.[32]\r\n\r\nBelieving herself, also, to be an object of peculiar dislike to George\r\nthe First, Lady Nithisdale's courage in braving the royal displeasure a\r\nsecond time, certainly appears to border upon folly and a rash temerity.\r\nBut she knew well that if she could once reach the land of the Maxwells,\r\nthe strict respect paid to the head of the clan, and the remarkable\r\nfidelity of all ranks of the Scotch to those who trust to their honour,\r\nwould there prove her safeguard. The great danger was in making the\r\njourney. But the young heroic Countess dismissed all fear from her mind,\r\nand prepared for her enterprise.\r\n\r\n\"In short,\" she thus prefaces her narrative, \"as I had once exposed my\r\nlife for the safety of the father, I could not do less than hazard it\r\nonce more for the fortune of the son. I had never travelled on horseback\r\nbut from York to London, as I told you; but the difficulties did not\r\narise now from the severity of the season, but the fear of being\r\ndiscovered and arrested. To avoid this, I bought three saddle-horses,\r\nand set off with my dear Evans and a very trusty servant, whom I brought\r\nwith me out of Scotland. We put up at all the smallest inns on the road,\r\nthat could take in a few horses, and where I thought I was not known;\r\nfor I was thoroughly known at all the considerable inns on the northern\r\nroad. Thus I arrived safe at Traquhair, where I thought myself secure,\r\nfor the lieutenant of the county being a friend of my lord's, would not\r\npermit any search to be made after me without sending me previous notice\r\nto abscond. Here I had the assurance to rest myself two whole days,\r\npretending that I was going to my own house with leave from Government.\r\nI sent no notice to my house, that the magistrates of Dumfries might not\r\nmake too narrow enquiries about me. So they were ignorant of my arrival\r\nin the country till I was at home, where I still feigned to have\r\npermission to remain. To carry on the deceit the better, I sent to all\r\nmy neighbours and invited them to come to my house. I took up my papers\r\nat night and sent them off to Traquhair. It was a particular stroke of\r\nprovidence that I made the dispatch I did, for they soon suspected me,\r\nand by a very favourable accident, one of them was overheard to say to\r\nthe magistrates of Dumfries, that the next day they would insist on\r\nseeing my leave from Government. This was bruited about, and when I was\r\ntold of it, I expressed my surprise that they should be so backward in\r\ncoming to pay their respects; 'but,' said I, 'better late than never: be\r\nsure to tell them that they shall be welcome whenever they choose to\r\ncome.'\r\n\r\n\"This was after dinner, but I lost no time to put everything in\r\nreadiness with all possible secrecy; and the next morning before\r\nday-break, I set off again for London with the same attendants, and, as\r\nbefore, put up at the smallest inns and arrived safe once more.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThe report of her journey into Scotland had preceded Lady Nithisdale's\r\nreturn to London; and, if we may credit her assertions, which are stated\r\nwith so much candour as to impart a certain conviction of their\r\ntruthfulness, their King was irritated beyond measure at the\r\nintelligence. Orders were immediately issued for her arrest; and the\r\nMonarch protested that Lady Nithisdale did whatever she pleased in spite\r\nof him; that she had given him more trouble than any other woman in\r\nEurope. Again driven into obscurity, Lady Nithisdale took the opinion of\r\na very celebrated lawyer, whose name she does not specify, and, upon\r\nhis opinion, determined to retire to the Continent. The reasons which\r\nher legal adviser assigned for this counsel was, that although, in other\r\ncircumstances, a wife cannot be prosecuted for saving her husband, yet\r\nin cases of high treason, according to the rigour of the law, the head\r\nof a wife is responsible for that of a husband. Since the King was so\r\nincensed against Lady Nithisdale there could be no answering for the\r\nconsequences, and he therefore earnestly besought her to leave the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nLady Nithisdale, conscious of the wisdom of this recommendation, and\r\nwearied, perhaps, of a life of apprehension, determined to adopt the\r\nplan recommended.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that she joined Lord Nithisdale at Rome, whither he had\r\nretired; for the statement which she has left concludes in a manner\r\nwhich shows that the devoted and heroic wife had been enabled to rejoin\r\nthe husband for whom she had encountered so much anxiety, contumely, and\r\nperil. Her son, it appears, also accompanied her, from her reference to\r\n\"our young Master,\" meaning the Master of Nithisdale; since, when she\r\nwrote, the Prince Charles Edward could not be endowed with that\r\nappellation, his father being then alive. Her narrative is thus\r\nconcluded:[34]--\r\n\r\n    \"This is the full narrative of what you desired, and of all the\r\n    transactions which passed relative to this affair. Nobody besides\r\n    yourself could have obtained it from me; but the obligations I owe\r\n    you, throw me under the necessity of refusing you nothing that is in\r\n    my power to do. As this is for yourself alone, your indulgence will\r\n    excuse all the faults which must occur in this long recital. The\r\n    truth you may, however, depend upon; attend to that and overlook all\r\n    deficiencies. My lord desires you to be assured of his sincere\r\n    friendship. I am, with the strongest attachment, my dear sister,\r\n    yours most affectionately,\r\n\r\n                                              \"WINIFRED NITHISDALE.\"\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the Earl of Nithisdale after his escape to Rome,\r\nwhere he died in 1744. He thus lived through a period of comparative\r\nquiet, till his native country was again on the eve of being embroiled\r\nin a civil war, more replete with danger, sullied by greater crimes, and\r\nmore disastrous to his native country, than the short-lived struggle of\r\n1715. An exile from his Scottish possessions, Lord Nithisdale possibly\r\nimplanted in the mind of his own son that yearning to establish the\r\nrights of the Stuarts which appears not to have been eradicated from the\r\nhearts of the Scottish Jacobites until their beloved and royal race had\r\nbecome lineally extinct.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of William, Earl of Nithisdale, have never been able to\r\nascertain where his Lordship is buried. His noble and admirable wife\r\ndied at Rome, as well as her husband; but her remains were brought to\r\nthis country, and they are deposited at Arundel Castle.\r\n\r\nJohn Maxwell, who assumed the title of Earl of Nithisdale, appears to\r\nhave remained absent from Scotland until the troubles of 1745 began. It\r\nwas probably on the death of his father in 1744, that he returned to\r\ntake possession of the family estates,--that this, the representative of\r\nthe family of Maxwell, ventured to appear in Dumfriesshire.\r\n\r\nThe following correspondence which passed between the Earl of\r\nNithisdale, popularly so called, and his friend, Mr. Craik, of\r\nArbigland[35] in Dumfriesshire, is a curious commentary upon the motives\r\nand reasons which actuated the minds of the Jacobites in the second\r\nattempt to re-establish the Stuart family. The first letter from Mr.\r\nCraik is dated October the thirteenth, 1745, when Edinburgh Castle was\r\nblockaded by Charles Edward, who was publishing his manifestoes from the\r\nsaloons of Holyrood House. The answer from Lord Nithisdale is written in\r\nreply to one of remonstrance addressed to him by his friend. There is no\r\ndate, but it is obviously written at Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe remonstrances from Mr. Craik were instantly dispatched, to avert, if\r\npossible, any decided step on the part of Lord Nithisdale. The arguments\r\nwhich it contains shew the friendly intention of the earnest writer.\r\nLord Nithisdale had, in his former letter, challenged his friend to\r\nassign his reasons for dissuading him from the enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM MR. CRAIK TO LORD NITHISDALE.\r\n\r\n    \"My waiting for a safe hand to convey this to you has prevented my\r\n    answering yours of the thirteenth sooner. It must give me great\r\n    pleasure that you have not determined to engage in the present\r\n    enterprize, which from several apparent symptoms I had reason to\r\n    apprehend; and if you stick by your promise of doeing nothing rashly\r\n    (fitt only for desperados indeed!) in a matter of such moment, I\r\n    shall be sett at ease from the anxiety I felt on your account.\r\n\r\n    \"In mine which gave occasion to yours, I really had no intention to\r\n    enter into the merits of the cause: all I meant was, to make\r\n    experiment how far my interest with you could prevail to keep you\r\n    undetermined till meeting, when I might promise myself more success\r\n    in reasoning upon the subject, than while you remained in town,\r\n    where the spirit of the place, the people you converse with, the\r\n    things you hear and see, all unite to inflame your passions and\r\n    confound your understanding. But since it has, beyond my intention,\r\n    engaged you to explain your sentiments at large, and to call upon\r\n    you to give my opinion, and since I suppose your arguments contain\r\n    all that can be said by those of the party who would be thought to\r\n    judge coolly and act reasonably at this juncture, I shall, with the\r\n    freedom and openness of a friend, consider them as they lye before\r\n    me in yours; and if I am forced to exceed the limits of a letter,\r\n    you may blame yourself, who drew me in. You tell me you are ready to\r\n    believe; I agree in opinion with you, that as matters are come to\r\n    this length, it's now greatly to the interest of Scotland to wish\r\n    success to the undertaking, and that nothing but the improbability\r\n    of success should hinder every Scotsman to join in it. This tho' a\r\n    verrie material point, you take for granted without assigning a\r\n    single reason; but as I know it is one of their delusive arguments,\r\n    now much in use where you are, and the chief engine of the party to\r\n    seduce well-meaning men to concur in the ruin of the constitution\r\n    and their country, I shall give you what I apprehend you must mean\r\n    by it in the most favourable light it will bear; and then from an\r\n    impartial stating of the fact as it truely stands, leave yourself to\r\n    judge how far an honest man, a wise one, and a lover of his country,\r\n    can justify either to himself or the worlde, his being of this\r\n    opinion. The meaning of your argument I take to be this: that by the\r\n    unaccountable success of the enterprize and the tame submission of\r\n    the people in general, if the scheme misgive all Scotland becomes\r\n    involved in the guilt, and may expect the outmost severitys this\r\n    Government and the people of England can afflict them with; but on\r\n    the other hand, should the undertaking be crowned with success, as\r\n    Scotesmen have the merit of it, they must become the peculiar\r\n    favourites of the family they have raised to the throne, and reap\r\n    all the advantages they can promise themselves from a grateful and\r\n    generous prince. I hope I have done justice to your argument, allow\r\n    me allso to do justice to facts and truth.\r\n\r\n    \"The people of Great Britain having found, from repeated\r\n    experiments, how precarious their libertys were in the hands of the\r\n    princes who founded their title to govern them in hereditary\r\n    right,--that however absurd the pretence was in itself, no example\r\n    could make them forego a claim which so much flattered their\r\n    ambition, and upon which only, with any shew of reason, arbitrary\r\n    power and tyranny can be built at last,--determined to secure (as\r\n    far as human prudence can) the possession of that inestimable\r\n    blessing to themselves and posterity by fixing the royal power in a\r\n    family whose only title should be the free choice of the people, and\r\n    who, should they attempt, would be restrained from inslaving those\r\n    they governed, and would not only act most absurdly, but might\r\n    reckon upon having the same voice of the people against them.\r\n\r\n    \"The maxims by which our hereditary princes conducted themselves,\r\n    were sufficiently felt to the sad experience of our forefathers;\r\n    thank God we were reserved for happier times! History will inform\r\n    you of their repeated and unwearied attempts to subvert the\r\n    constitution and inslave a free people. Their sacrifizing the\r\n    interest of the nation to France, their violating their oaths and\r\n    promises, their persecutions and their schemes to establish a\r\n    religion which in its nature is inconsistent with the toleration of\r\n    any other, though reasons of state may make it wink at this on\r\n    particular occasions,--but should I descend to particulars, it would\r\n    lead me beyond the limites I have prescribed myself.\r\n\r\n    \"The present family have now reigned over us these thirty years, and\r\n    though during so long a time they may have fallen into errors, or\r\n    may have committed faults, (as what Government is without?) yett I\r\n    will defy the most sanguin zealot to find in history a period equal\r\n    to this in which Scotland possessed so uninterrupted a felicity, in\r\n    which liberty, civil and religious, was so universally enjoyed by\r\n    all people of whatever denomination--nay, by the open and avowed\r\n    ennemys of the family and constitution, or a period in which all\r\n    ranks of men have been so effectually secured in their property.\r\n    Have not trade, manufactures, agriculture, and the spirit of\r\n    industry in our country, extended themselves further during this\r\n    period and under this family than for ages before? Has any man\r\n    suffered in his liberty, life, or fortune, contrary to law? Stand\r\n    forth and name him if you can. Tho' the King's person, his family,\r\n    his government, and his ministers, have been openly abused a\r\n    thousand times in the most scurrilous and reproachful terms, could\r\n    it ever provoke him to one arbitrary act or to violate those laws\r\n    which he had made the rule of his government? Look into the reigns\r\n    of the James's and the Charles's, and tell me wither these divine\r\n    and hereditary princes were guided by the same spirit of mildness\r\n    and forgivness?\r\n\r\n    \"I am sensible how often and how many destructive designs have been\r\n    imputed to the prince upon the throne and his ministers, of the cry\r\n    raised against standing armies, of the complaints of corruption,\r\n    long parliaments, and Hanoverian interest pursued in opposition to\r\n    that of Britain; but I am allso sensible there is not a true friend\r\n    to liberty, a dispassionate and sober man, but who (now the mask is\r\n    laid aside) perceives they were, at bottom, the artifices and\r\n    popular pretences of men struggling to force themselves into power,\r\n    or of those who in the dark were aiming the destruction of our happy\r\n    constitution.\r\n\r\n    \"Men endued with popular talents, of figure and fortune in the\r\n    world, and without the advantages of apparent disinterestedness on\r\n    their side, will allways have address enough, with a seeming\r\n    plausibility, to pervert every act of Government at home, and to\r\n    defame and run down every publick transaction abroad; and disciples\r\n    will never be wanting of capacity and passions fitted to become the\r\n    dupes of such false apostles. The corruption complained of is but\r\n    too universal, and it's to be feared too deep-rooted to be cured; it\r\n    is the constant attendant of peace and wealth; and such is the\r\n    depravity of our natures, that these blessings cannot be enjoyed\r\n    without having this plague, the most sordid and detestable of all\r\n    vices, accompanying them. But if it is in our governours, it is also\r\n    in the people, and change your kings and ministers as often as you\r\n    please, whoever is in possession, or whoever is in quest of power,\r\n    will allways lay hold of the vices, the follys, or the prejudices of\r\n    mankind to exclude others from it or to acquire it to themselves.\r\n\r\n    \"It's to be hoped most people now perceive with what views they were\r\n    taught to exclaim against and oppose a standing body of native and\r\n    freeborn troops; but it is to be lamented their eyes were reserved\r\n    to be opened only by the greatest of all publick calamitys.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, from the following letter of Mr. Craik, that Lord\r\nNithisdale was really implicated in the insurrection:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord,\r\n\r\n    \"I am sincerely and deeply touched with your Lordship's situation,\r\n    and can honestly assure you it would give me a real satisfaction\r\n    could I any how contribute to save you on this unhappy occasion. As\r\n    you have done me the honour to ask my opinion how you are to conduct\r\n    yourself, and as the Doctor has informed me of the circumstances of\r\n    your journey, I should but ill deserve the character of humanity and\r\n    good nature you are pleased to give me, if I did not, with freedom\r\n    and candour, lay before you what, after this day having fully\r\n    considered it, appears to me most for your honour, and the safty and\r\n    preservation of your life and family.\r\n\r\n    \"It is certain the Habeas Corpus Act is suspended, and I doubt not\r\n    but as soon as the lenth you have gone and your being returned is\r\n    known above, warrants will be issued to carrie you up to London; if\r\n    you retire out of the kingdom, it will not prevent your being\r\n    attainted; and I am afraid the unfortunate step you have made will\r\n    putt your estate but too much within the reach of the law, and your\r\n    family is undone. If you stay till you are apprehended, not only\r\n    your estate, but your person is in the mercy of the Government, and\r\n    how far severitys on this occasion may be carried, is not for me to\r\n    prescribe; only I am apprehensive your religion, quality, and\r\n    estate, will make you but too obnoxious to the Government, and when\r\n    the affair is over, informers will not be wanting to furnish them\r\n    with materials.\r\n\r\n    \"We are not ignorant what arts and industry have been employed to\r\n    draw you out of the retirement and quiet you were well disposed to\r\n    remain in. We are sensible you were imposed upon by those already\r\n    embarked; and it will acquit you before God and every sober man, if\r\n    you no longer keep measures with those who have deceived you in a\r\n    matter of such moment, when your life and fortune were at stake. My\r\n    lord, I have impartially laid before you the present circumstance\r\n    you are in, as far as my abilities enable me to judge, that you may\r\n    have it under your Lordship's consideration; I shall next take the\r\n    freedom to suggest what to me appears the safest and most prudent\r\n    part now left to you to act, and which I likeways submit to your\r\n    Lordship's own judgment, without taking upon me to decide. What I\r\n    mean is this, that your Lordship should, without loss of time,\r\n    surrender your person to the Governor of Carlisle, and acquaint him\r\n    you came to throw yourself upon the clemency of the Government; at\r\n    the same time, your Lordship would, by express, have some proper\r\n    friend at London advised of your intention, and one of some weight\r\n    and interest, and who was fitt to put your conduct in the most\r\n    favourable light. You will easily perceive that this confidence in\r\n    the Government, and voluntary surrender of your person, and your\r\n    preventing all others in an early repentance must distinguish you,\r\n    in the eyes of the Government, from every other person who has\r\n    embarked, and entitle you to its favour and protection: whereas, if\r\n    you wait till you are apprehended, or leave the kingdom, your case,\r\n    tho' quite different, will be ranked with those who have gone the\r\n    greatest lengths. If your Lordship approve of this, if you think\r\n    proper to lett me know by a line to-morrow, I shall not faill to be\r\n    in town on Tuesday; and as I have a friend at London who I know is\r\n    very capable and well disposed to serve you, if it be agreeable to\r\n    you, shall, with the Doctor, concert the letter proper to be sent.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer of Lord Nithisdale contains a curious summary of some of the\r\nmotives which actuated the Jacobites of 1745.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM LORD NITHISDALE TO MR. CRAIK.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"I have both yours, giving your opinion on the present affairs,\r\n    without assigning your reasons, and as I take it, urging an answer\r\n    from me, whether I am determined to take a share in the present\r\n    enterprise, which you seem to think I should not. I shall answer the\r\n    last first, by telling you that I have not yet fully digested my\r\n    thoughts on that matter; only be assured I'll do nothing\r\n    rashly--that's only for desperados. As to the other, I'm ready to\r\n    believe you agree in opinion with me, that as matters are come this\r\n    length, it's now greatly the interest of Scotland to wish success\r\n    to the undertaking; and that nothing but the improbability of\r\n    success should hinder every Scotsman to join in it; and indeed I\r\n    don't think there's great reason to fear that either, unless vast\r\n    numbers of foreign forces are poured into the country for support of\r\n    the party in possession.\r\n\r\n    \"The Militia of England are little to be feared, nor do I believe\r\n    they'll be trusted with arms, as there's a chance what way they may\r\n    be used, particularly by that part of the country who only know how\r\n    to handle them. As to the Dutch who are come over, there's now\r\n    greater reason to believe they'll be recalled, and it may be some\r\n    time before others are sent in their place, if at all. I do believe\r\n    the United States, if they dare, will give all the support they can;\r\n    but if France shall really prove in earnest, I imagine they'll\r\n    consider it necessary to be quiet. Other foreign forces may be sent\r\n    in, but on the other hand there's a very great improbability; thir\r\n    people will likewise get aid, and here there's assembling a very\r\n    numerous resolute army. The prospect of the situation of the country\r\n    for some time to come, must affect every well-wisher to it, and the\r\n    consequences to this part, if the undertaking shall misgive, appear\r\n    to me terrible; if it succeed, what have we to fear? You'll answer,\r\n    the introduction of Popery and arbitrary government; but I don't\r\n    imagine, considering the success and fate of his grandfather and\r\n    uncle, that will be attempted; and as to any fear that we may be\r\n    made dependant and tributary to the foreign powers giving aid to the\r\n    present adventure, that I'm not apprehensive of, nor do I imagine\r\n    it would be in his power to accomplish, tho' inclinable to it. I\r\n    shall say no more on the subject; only it's easier preventing an\r\n    evil than remedying, and that may be applyed to both sides; only\r\n    this one further I observe, that I think it's the interest of the\r\n    nation to have a sovereign settled whose title is unquestionable: we\r\n    see the inconveniencys attending the other. You'll perhaps answer,\r\n    there will still be a Pretender; but I reply, not so dangerous an\r\n    one, if at all. You write, in your letter, that people may, without\r\n    meaning, be treated and led away with popular arguments. I assure\r\n    you I'm none of these--what I have said now, is on a Sunday\r\n    forenoon. However, I should wish you communicate my mind to nobody.\r\n    If any material news occur before the bearer leave Edinburgh, you\r\n    shall have them; and to-morrow I'll mind your commission, and any\r\n    other you shall give with respect to your nursery, &c., which I hope\r\n    you're still carrying on, and that your garden-wall is now\r\n    completed. If you had some pieces of cannon to place in it, would it\r\n    not keep out against an army not provided with battering-pieces,\r\n    seeing it's at a sufficient distance from the thundering of any\r\n    castle? Were it not for fear of your horses, I should wish you came\r\n    in here and saw the fortifications made on our city-wall, and the\r\n    army against which they were intended; the last is worth your while.\r\n    No Court in Europe is filled with such a set of well-look'd brave\r\n    fellows.\r\n\r\n    \"I hope my dykers are going on, and beg you'll acquaint the tenants\r\n    to have the rents ready, in regard I'm to be soon in the country,\r\n    and won't make any stay above a day or two; this to you, but to\r\n    yourself I can yet fix no time for coming out as I can't think of\r\n    leaving Edinburgh till I see how matters turn, and it's also\r\n    necessary to stay and take care of my house, furniture, papers, &c.\r\n    I believe I shall eat my Christmas goose with you, if I don't go\r\n    into England, which I would incline for sake of a jaunt, if I\r\n    thought it safe and had a right set with me. I ever am, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n                                                        \"Your's &c.\"\r\n\r\nAnother letter from a kinsman of Lord Nithisdale's shews that he was not\r\nalone in his inclination to join in the Insurrection of 1745.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM MR.

I depend upon your protection for those I leave\r\n    behind. What gives me the greatest concern is least some such\r\n    creditors as have still my father's security, should molest him in\r\n    my absence.

Maxwell.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Saturday.--I set out before daylight to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n    From Mr. Maxwell of Carruchan, to Mr. Craik of Arbigland.\r\n\r\nSince Lord Nithisdale's name did not appear in the list of the young\r\nChevalier's officers, we must conclude that he did not persevere in his\r\nresolutions. There is no date to Mr. Craik's second letter, but it must\r\nhave been written after Carlisle had surrendered to the Duke of\r\nCumberland,--an event which took place on the thirtieth of December,\r\n1745.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Nithisdale, as he was styled, lived until the year 1776, and\r\npossibly in peace and prosperity, since the family estates were spared\r\nto him. He married his first cousin, Lady Catherine Stewart, daughter of\r\nthe Earl of Traquhair by Lady Mary Maxwell, and left an only daughter.\r\n\r\nThis lady, named after her celebrated grandmother Winifred, was also, by\r\ncourtesy, endowed with the honours of the forfeited rank, and styled\r\nLady Winifred Maxwell. Her Ladyship would have inherited the Barony of\r\nHerries, of Terregles, but for the attainder of her grandfather. The\r\nestates of Lord Nithisdale were inherited by her son, Marmaduke William\r\nConstable, Esq., of Everingham Park, in the county of York; who, on the\r\ndeath of his mother, assumed, by royal licence, the surname of Maxwell.\r\nThe title of Nithisdale, except for the attainder, would have descended\r\nupon the next heir, Mr. Maxwell of Carruchan.[36]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] There is no statement of the date of Lord Nithisdale's birth in any\r\nof the usual authorities, neither can his descendant, William Constable\r\nMaxwell, Esq., of Terregles, supply the deficient information.\r\n\r\n[2] Secret History of Colonel Hooke's Negotiations, by himself, p. 175.\r\nLondon, 1740.\r\n\r\n[3] Patten's History of the Rebellion, of 1715, p. 234.\r\n\r\n[4] Service of the Earl of Eglintoun, as heir male of the Earl of\r\nWintoun.

To Mrs. Constable Maxwell, of\r\nTerregles, I am indebted for the following interesting description of\r\nthe portrait of Lady Nithisdale, to which I have referred. \"Her hair is\r\nlight brown, slightly powdered, and she is represented with large soft\r\neyes, regular features, and fair, rather pale complexion. Her soft\r\nexpression and delicate appearance give little indication of the\r\nstrength of mind and courage which she displayed. Her dress is blue\r\nsilk, with a border of cambric, and the drapery a cloak of brown silk.\"\r\n\r\n[28] His son was restored to his father's honours. The title of Marquis\r\nof Powis became extinct; but the estates devolved on Lord Herbert of\r\nCherbury, husband to the last Marquis's niece; and ultimately to Lady\r\nHenrietta Herbert, who married Lord Clive, created Earl of\r\nPowis.--_Burke's Extinct Peerage_.\r\n\r\n[29] Faithful Register, p. 84.\r\n\r\n[30] Faithful Register, p. 86.\r\n\r\n[31] Burke's History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, vol.\r\ni. p. 329.\r\n\r\n[32] See Letters and Petitions in the State Papers, No. iii. p. 1716.\r\n\r\n[33] See Burke's Commoners, vol. i. p. 333.\r\n\r\n[34] See Burke's Commoners, vol. i. p. 334.\r\n\r\n[35] I am indebted to the present Mr. Craik, of Arbigland, for this\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n[36] I am indebted for some of these particulars to the courtesy of\r\nWilliam Constable Maxwell, Esq., present owner of Terregles,\r\nCarlaverock, and also of the beautiful hereditary property of Lincluden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GORDON, VISCOUNT KENMURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of the distinguished surname of Gordon is not clearly\r\nascertained: \"some,\" says Douglass, \"derive the Gordons from a city of\r\nMacedonia, named Gordonia; others from a manor in Normandy called\r\nGordon, possessed by a family of that name. The territory of Gordon in\r\nBerwickshire was, according to another account, conferred by David the\r\nFirst upon an Anglo-Norman settler, who assumed from it the name of\r\nGordon.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Gordon, sixth Earl of Kenmure, was descended from a younger son\r\nof the ducal house of Gordon; in 1633 Sir John Gordon of Lochinvar was\r\ncreated Viscount Kenmure and Lord of Lochinvar; and the estates\r\ncontinued in an unbroken line until they descended to William, the sixth\r\nViscount, who was the only Scottish peer in 1715 who suffered capital\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate nobleman succeeded his father in 1698; and possessed,\r\nup to the period of his taking the command of the army in the south, the\r\nestates belonging to his family in the Stuartry of Kirkcudbright.\r\nKenmure Castle, still happily enjoyed by the family of Gordon, stands\r\nupon an eminence overlooking the meadows, at that point where the river\r\nKen expands into a lake. The Castle was originally a single tower, to\r\nwhich various additions have been made according to the taste of\r\ndifferent owners. The Castle Keep is now ruinous and unroofed, but the\r\nbody of the house is in good repair. A fine prospect over the scenery of\r\nthe Glenhens is commanded by the eminence on which the castle stands. An\r\nancient avenue of lime-trees constitutes the approach to the fortress\r\nfrom the road.\r\n\r\nIn this abode dwelt the Viscount Kenmure until the summons of Lord Mar\r\ncalled him from the serene tenour of a course honoured by others, and\r\npeaceful from the tranquillity of the unhappy nobleman's own\r\ndisposition; for his was not the restless ambition of Mar, nor the blind\r\ndevotion of the Duke of Perth; nor the passion for fame and ascendancy\r\nwhich stimulated Lord George Murray in his exertions. Lord Kenmure was,\r\nit is true, well acquainted with public business, and an adept in the\r\naffairs of the political world, in which he had obtained that insight\r\nwhich long experience gives. His acquaintance with books and men was\r\nsaid to be considerable; he is allowed, even by one who had deserted the\r\nparty which Lord Kenmure espoused, to be of a \"very extraordinary\r\nknowledge.\"[37] But his calm, reflective mind, his experience, his\r\nresources of learning, rather indisposed than inclined this nobleman\r\nfrom rising when called upon to lend his aid to the perilous enterprise\r\nof James Stuart. Beloved in private life, of a singularly good temper,\r\ncalm, mild, of simple habits, and plain in his attire, he was as it was\r\ngenerally observed, the last man whom one might have expected to rush\r\ninto the schemes of the Jacobite party.\r\n\r\nThat one so skilled in human affairs should venture, even in a\r\nsubordinate degree, to espouse so desperate a cause as that of James was\r\ngenerally reputed to be, might seem to prove that even the wise were\r\nsanguine, or that they were carried away by the enthusiasm of the hour.\r\nNeither of these circumstances appear to bear any considerable weight in\r\nrevolving the conduct of Lord Kenmure.\r\n\r\nA stronger influence, perhaps, than that of loyalty operated on the\r\nconduct of Viscount Kenmure. He was married: his wife, the spirited and\r\nenergetic Mary Dalzell, was the only sister of Robert, sixth Earl of\r\nCarnwath. Her family were deeply imbued with the principles of\r\nhereditary right and of passive obedience; and Lady Kenmure cherished\r\nthese sentiments, and bestowed the energies of her active mind on the\r\npromotion of that cause which she held sacred. The house of Dalzell had\r\nbeen sufferers in the service of the Stuarts. By her mother's side, Lady\r\nKenmure was connected with Sir William Murray of Stanhope, and with his\r\nsingular, and yet accomplished son, Sir Alexander Murray of Stanhope,\r\nwho was taken prisoner at Preston, fighting for the Jacobites. The Earl\r\nof Carnwath, Lady Kenmure's brother, was one of those men whose virtues\r\nand acquirements successfully recommend a cause to all who are under the\r\ninfluence of such a character. Having been educated at Cambridge, he\r\nhad imbibed an early affection for the liturgy of the Church of England;\r\nhis gentle manners, his talents, and his natural eloquence, established\r\nhim in the affections of his friends and acquaintance. This nobleman\r\nwas, like his sister, ready to sacrifice everything for conscience sake:\r\nlike her, he was a sufferer for that which he esteemed to be justice. He\r\nwas afterwards taken prisoner at Preston, impeached before the House of\r\nPeers in 1716, and sentenced to be executed as a traitor, and his estate\r\nforfeited; but eventually he was respited and pardoned. He survived to\r\nbe four times married.\r\n\r\nAnother of Lady Kenmure's brothers, John Dalzell, was, it is true, a\r\ncaptain in the army upon the breaking out of the Rebellion in 1715; but,\r\nat the summons of him whom he esteemed his lawful Sovereign, he threw up\r\nhis commission, and engaged in the service of James.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Kenmure received a commission from the Earl of Mar to head the\r\nfriends of the Chevalier in the South, he had ties which perhaps were\r\namong some of the considerations which led him to hesitate and to accept\r\nthe proffered honour unwillingly. On his trial he referred to his wife\r\nand \"four small children,\" as a plea for mercy. But Lady Kenmure,\r\nsanguine and resolute, did not view these little dependent beings as\r\nobstacles to a participation in the insurrection. If she might be\r\nconsidered to transgress her duty as a mother, in thus risking the\r\nfortunes of her children, she afterwards compensated by her energy and\r\nself-denial for her early error of judgment.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that the insurrection in Dumfriesshire was to break\r\nout in conjunction with that headed in Northumberland by Mr. Forster. To\r\neffect this end, numbers of disaffected, or, as the Jacobite writers\r\ncall them, well-affected noblemen and gentlemen assembled in parties at\r\nthe houses of their friends, moving about from place to place, in order\r\nto prepare for the event.\r\n\r\nIt was on the twelfth of October, 1715, that Viscount Kenmure set out in\r\nthe intention of joining the Earl of Wintoun, who was on his road to\r\nMoffat, and who was accompanied by a party of Lothian gentlemen and\r\ntheir servants. It is said by the descendants of Viscount Kenmure, on\r\nhearsay, that his Lordship's horse three times refused to go forward on\r\nthat eventful morning; nor could he be impelled to do so, until Lady\r\nKenmure taking off her apron, and throwing it over the horse's eyes, the\r\nanimal was led forward. The Earl of Carnwath had joined with Lord\r\nKenmure, and rode forwards with him to the rencontre with Lord Wintoun.\r\nLord Kenmure took with him three hundred men to the field.[38]\r\n\r\nAt the siege of Preston, in which those who fell dead upon the field\r\nwere less to be compassionated than the survivors, Lord Kenmure was\r\ntaken prisoner. His brother-in-law, the Earl of Carnwath, shared the\r\nsame fate. They were sent with the principal state prisoners to London.\r\nThe same circumstances, the same indignities, attended the removal of\r\nLord Kenmure to his last earthly abode, as those which have been already\r\nrelated as disgracing the humanity of Englishmen, when the Earl of\r\nDerwentwater was carried to the Tower.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent sufferings of these brave men were aggravated by the\r\nabuses which then existed in the state prisons of England. The condition\r\nof these receptacles of woe, at that period, beggars all description.\r\nCorruption and extortion gave every advantage to those who could command\r\nmoney enough to purchase luxuries at an enormous cost. Oppression and an\r\nutter carelessness of the well-being of the captive, pressed hardly upon\r\nthose who were poor. No annals can convey a more heartrending\r\ndescription of the sufferings of the prisoners confined in county gaols,\r\nthan their own touching and heartfelt appeals, some of which are to be\r\nfound in the State Paper Office.\r\n\r\nIn the Tower, especially, it appears from a diary kept by a gentleman\r\nwho was confined there, that the greatest extortion was openly\r\npractised. Mr. Forster and a Mr. Anderton, who were allowed to live in\r\nthe Governor's house, were charged the sum of five pounds a-week for\r\ntheir lodging and diet,--a demand which, more than a century ago, was\r\ndeemed enormous. Several of the Highland chiefs, and among them the\r\ncelebrated Brigadier Mackintosh, were \"clapped up in places of less\r\naccommodation, for which, nevertheless, they were charged as much as\r\nwould have almost paid the rent of the best houses in St. James's Square\r\nand Piccadilly.\" Mr. Forster, it must be added, was obliged to pay sixty\r\nguineas for his privilege of living in the governor's house; and Mr.\r\nAnderton to give a bribe of twenty-five guineas for having his irons\r\noff. A similar tax was made upon every one who entered, and who could\r\npay, and they were thankful to proffer the sum of twenty guineas, the\r\nusual demand, to be free from irons. It was, indeed, not the mere\r\nfreedom from chains for which they paid, but for the power of effecting\r\ntheir escape. Upon every one who did not choose to be turned over to the\r\ncommon side, a demand was made of ten guineas fee, besides two guineas\r\nweekly for lodging, although in some rooms men lay four in a bed.\r\nPresents were also given privately, so that in three or four months'\r\ntime, three or four thousand pounds were paid by the prisoners to their\r\njailers.\r\n\r\nMany of the prisoners being men of fortune, their tables were of the\r\nmost luxurious description; forty shillings was often paid for a dish of\r\npeas and beans, and thirty shillings for a dish of fish; and this fare,\r\nso unlike that of imprisonment, was accompanied by the richest French\r\nwines. The vicious excesses and indecorums which went on in the Tower,\r\namong the state prisoners, are said to have scandalized the graver\r\nlookers on.[39] The subsequent distress and misery which ensued may, of\r\ncourse, be traced, in part to this cause.\r\n\r\nLord Derwentwater, ever decorous and elevated in his deportment, was\r\nshocked at the wayward and reckless conduct of some of the Jacobites on\r\ntheir road to London, told one of the King's officers at Barnet that\r\nthese prisoners \"were only fit for Bedlam.\" To this it was remarked,\r\nthat they were only fit for Bridewell. Whilst hopes of life continued,\r\nthis rebuke still applied. The prisoners were aided in their excesses by\r\nthe enthusiasm of the fair sex. The following extract from another\r\nobscure work, \"The History of the Press-yard,\" is too curious to be\r\nomitted. \"That while they [the prisoners] flattered themselves with\r\nhopes of life, which they were made to believe were the necessary\r\nconsequences of a surrender at discretion, they did, without any\r\nretrospect to the crimes they were committed for, live in so profuse a\r\nmanner, and fared so voluptuously, through the means of daily visitants\r\nand helps from abroad, that money circulated very plentifully; and while\r\nit was difficult to change a guinea almost at any house in the street,\r\nnothing was more easy than to have silver for gold to any quantity, and\r\ngold for silver, in the prison,--those of the fair sex, from persons of\r\nthe first rank to tradesmen's wives and daughters, making a sacrifice of\r\ntheir husbands' and parents' rings, and other precious moveables, for\r\nthe use of those prisoners; so that, till the trial of the condemned\r\nlords was over, and that the Earl of Derwentwater and Viscount Kenmure\r\nwere beheaded, there was scarce anything to be seen amongst them but\r\nflaunting apparel, venison pasties, hams, chickens, and other costly\r\nmeats, with plenty of wine.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime the trial of the attainted lords took place, and checked, like\r\nthe sudden appearance of a ghostly apparition, this horrible\r\nmerriment,--with which, however, few names which one desires to cherish\r\nand to respect are connected. The same forms that attended the\r\nimpeachment and trial of his companions, were carried on at the trial of\r\nLord Kenmure. The unhappy nobleman replied in few and touching words,\r\nand, in a voice which could not be heard, pleaded guilty; an\r\ninconsistency, to express it in the mildest terms, of which he\r\nafterwards sincerely repented.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the trial, to the question \"What have you to say for\r\nyourself why judgment should not be passed upon you according to law?\"\r\n\"My lords,\" replied Lord Kenmure, \"I am truly sensible of my crime, and\r\nwant words to express my repentance. God knows I never had any personal\r\nprejudice against his Majesty, nor was I ever accessory to any previous\r\ndesign against him. I humbly beg my noble Peers and the honourable House\r\nof Commons to intercede with the King for mercy to me, that I may live\r\nto show myself the dutifullest of his subjects, and to be the means to\r\nkeep my wife and four small children from starving; the thoughts of\r\nwhich, with my crime, makes me the most unfortunate of all gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the trial, great intercessions were made for mercy, but without\r\nany avail, as far as Lord Derwentwater and Lord Kenmure were concerned.\r\nThey were ordered for execution on the 24th of February, 1716.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence of the condemnation of these two lords, produced the\r\ngreatest dismay among their fellow sufferers in the Tower; and the\r\nnotion of escape, a project which was singularly successful in some\r\ninstances, was resorted to, in the despair and anguish of the moment, by\r\nthose who dreaded a cruel and ignominious death.\r\n\r\nLord Kenmure, meantime, prepared for death. A very short interval was,\r\nindeed, allowed for those momentous considerations which his situation\r\ninduced. He was sentenced on the ninth of February, and in a fortnight\r\nafterwards was to suffer. Yet the execution of that sentence was, it\r\nseems, scarcely expected by the sufferer, even when the fatal day\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nThe night before his execution, Lord Kenmure wrote a long and affecting\r\nletter to a nobleman who had visited him in prison a few days\r\npreviously. There is something deeply mournful in the fate of one who\r\nhad slowly and unwillingly taken up the command which had ensured to him\r\nthe severest penalties of the law. There is an inexpressibly painful\r\nsentiment of compassion and regret, excited by the yearning to live--the\r\nallusion to a reprieve--the allusion to the case of Lord Carnwath as\r\naffording more of hope than his own--lastly, to what he cautiously calls\r\n\"an act of indiscretion,\" the plea of guilty, which was wrung from this\r\nconscientious, but sorrowing man, by a fond value for life and for the\r\nliving. So little did Lord Kenmure anticipate his doom, that, when he\r\nwas summoned to the scaffold the following day, he had not even prepared\r\na black suit,--a circumstance which he much regretted, since he \"might\r\nbe said to have died with more decency.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the letter which he wrote, and which he addressed to a\r\ncertain nobleman.\r\n\r\n    \"My very good Lord,\r\n\r\n    \"Your Lordship has interested yourself so far in mine, and the\r\n    lords, my fellow prisoners' behalf, that I should be the greatest\r\n    criminal now breathing, should I, whether the result of your\r\n    generous intercession be life or death, be neglectful of paying my\r\n    acknowledgments for that act of compassion.\r\n\r\n    \"We have already discoursed of the motives that induced me to take\r\n    arms against the Prince now in possession of the throne, when you\r\n    did me the honour of a visit three days since in my prison here; I\r\n    shall therefore wave that point, and lament my unhappiness for\r\n    joining in the rest of the lords in pleading guilty, in the hopes of\r\n    that mercy, which the Generals Wills and Carpenter will do us the\r\n    justice to say was promised us by both of them. Mr. Piggot and Mr.\r\n    Eyres, the two lawyers employed by us, advised us to this plea, the\r\n    avoiding of which might have given us further time for looking after\r\n    the concerns of another life, though it had ended in the same\r\n    sentence of losing this which we now lie under. Thanks be to the\r\n    Divine Majesty, to whose infinite mercy as King of Kings, I\r\n    recommend myself in hopes of forgiveness, tho' it shall be my fate\r\n    to fail of it here on earth. Had the House of Commons thought fit to\r\n    have received our petition with the same candour as yours has done,\r\n    and recommended us to the Prince, we might have entertained some\r\n    hopes of life; but the answer from St. James's is such as to make us\r\n    have little or no thoughts of it.\r\n\r\n    \"Under these dismal apprehensions, then, of approaching dissolution,\r\n    which, I thank my God for his holy guidance, I have made due\r\n    preparation for, give me leave to tell you, that howsoever I have\r\n    been censured on account of the family of the Gordons, which I am an\r\n    unhappy branch of, that I have ever lived and will die in the\r\n    profession of the Protestant religion, and that I abhor all\r\n    king-killing doctrines that are taught by the church of Rome as\r\n    dangerous and absurd. And though I have joined with some that have\r\n    taken arms, of that persuasion, no other motive but that of\r\n    exercising to the person called the Pretender, whom I firmly believe\r\n    to be the son of the late King James the Second, and in defence of\r\n    whose title I am now going to be a sacrifice, has induced me to it.\r\n    Your Lordship will remember the papers I have left with you, and\r\n    deliver them to my son. They may be of use to his future conduct in\r\n    life, when these eyes of mine are closed in death, which I could\r\n    have wished might have stolen upon me in the ordinary course of\r\n    nature, and not by the hand of the executioner. But as my blessed\r\n    Saviour and Redeemer suffered an ignominious and cruel death, and\r\n    the Son of God, made flesh, did not disdain to have his feet nailed\r\n    to the Cross for the sins of the world; so may I, poor miserable\r\n    sinner, as far as human nature will allow, patiently bear with the\r\n    hands of violence, that I expect suddenly to be stretched out\r\n    against me.\r\n\r\n    \"Your Lordship will also, provided there is no hopes of a reprieve\r\n    this night, make me acquainted with it as soon as possible, that I\r\n    may meet that fate with readiness which, in a state of uncertainty,\r\n    I expect with uneasiness. I must also be pressing with your Lordship\r\n    that if, in case of death, any paper under my name should come out\r\n    as pretended to have been written by me, in the manner or form of a\r\n    speech, you will not believe it to be genuine; for I, that am\r\n    heartily sorry for disowning my principles in one spoken before your\r\n    Lordship and the rest of my peers, will never add to that act of\r\n    indiscretion by saying anything on the scaffold but my prayers for\r\n    the forgiveness of my poor self and those that have brought me to be\r\n    a spectacle to men and angels, especially since I must speak in my\r\n    last moments according to the dictates of my conscience, and not\r\n    prevaricate as I did before the Lords, for which I take shame to\r\n    myself. And such a method of proceeding might do injury to my\r\n    brother Carnwath, who, I am told, is in a much fairer way than I am\r\n    of not being excluded from grace. I have nothing farther than to\r\n    implore your Lordships to charge your memory with the\r\n    recommendations I gave you to my wife and children, beseeching God\r\n    that he will so sanctify their afflictions, that after the pains and\r\n    terrors of this mortal life they may with me be translated to the\r\n    regions of everlasting joy and happiness, to which blessed state of\r\n    immortality your Lordship shall also, while I am living, be\r\n    recommended in the prayers of, my very good Lord, your most\r\n    affectionate kinsman,\r\n\r\n                                                           Kenmure.\"\r\n\r\n    \"From my prison, in the Tower of London, Feb. 23, 1715.\"\r\n\r\nThe following paper, the original of which is still in the hands of his\r\ndescendants, was written by Lord Kenmure the night before his\r\nexecution:--\r\n\r\n    \"It having pleased the Almighty God to call me now to suffer a\r\n    violent death, I adore the Divine Majesty, and cheerfully resign my\r\n    soul and body to His hands, whose mercy is over all His works. It is\r\n    my very great comfort that He has enabled me to hope, through the\r\n    merits and by the blood of Jesus Christ, He will so purifie me how\r\n    that I perish not eternally. I die a Protestant of the Church of\r\n    England, and do from my heart forgive all my enemies. I thank God I\r\n    cannot accuse my selfe of the sin of rebellion, however some people\r\n    may by a mistaken notion think me guilty of it for all I did upon a\r\n    laite occasione; and my only desire ever was to contribute my small\r\n    endeavour towards the re-establishing my rightfull Sovereigne and\r\n    the constitutione of my countrie to ther divine rights and loyall\r\n    setlment; and by pleading guilty I meant no more then ane\r\n    acknowledgment of my having been in armes, and (not being bred to\r\n    the law) had no notion of my therby giving my assent to any other\r\n    thing contained in that charge. I take God to wittnes, before whom I\r\n    am very soon to apear, that I never had any desire to favour or to\r\n    introduce Popery, and I have been all along fully satisfied that the\r\n    King has given all the morall security for the Church of England\r\n    that is possible for him in his circumstances. I owne I submitted\r\n    myselfe to the Duck of Brunswick, justly expecting that humantity\r\n    would have induced him to give me my life, which if he had done I\r\n    was resolved for the future to have lived peaceably, and to have\r\n    still reteaned a greatfull remembrance of so greatt a favour, and I\r\n    am satisfied the King would never have desired me to have been in\r\n    action for him after; but the caice is otherways. I pray God forgive\r\n    those who thirst after blood. Had we been all putt to the sword\r\n    immediatly upon our surrender, that might have born the construction\r\n    of being don in the heatt and fury of passion; but now I am to die\r\n    in cold blood, I pray God it be not imputed to them. May Almighty\r\n    God restore injured right, and peace, and truth, and may He in mercy\r\n    receave my soull.\r\n\r\n                                                       Kenmure.\"[40]\r\n\r\nIt was decreed that the Earl of Derwentwater and the Viscount Kenmure\r\nshould suffer on the same day. On the morning of the twenty-fourth of\r\nFebruary, at ten o'clock, these noblemen were conducted to the Transport\r\nOffice on Tower Hill, where they had separate rooms for their private\r\ndevotions, and where such friends as desired to be admitted to them\r\ncould take a last farewell. It had been settled that the Earl of\r\nNithisdale should also suffer at the same time, but during the previous\r\nnight he had escaped. Whether the condemned lords, who were so soon to\r\nexchange life for immortality, were made aware of that event or not, has\r\nnot transpired. What must have been their emotions, supposing that they\r\nwere conscious that one who had shared their prison, was likely to be\r\nrestored to his liberty and to his family!\r\n\r\nLord Kenmure conducted himself with a manly composure and courage during\r\nthis last trial of his submission and fortitude. His reserve, however,\r\non the scaffold was remarkable. It proceeded from a fear, incidental to\r\na conscientious mind, of saying anything inconsistent with his loyalty\r\nand principles; and from an apprehension, natural in the dying husband\r\nand father, of injuring the welfare of those whom he was to leave at the\r\nmercy of Government.\r\n\r\nLord Derwentwater suffered first: his last ejaculation, \"Sweet Jesus be\r\nmerciful unto me!\" was cut short by the executioner severing his head\r\nfrom his body. Then, after the body and the head had been carried away,\r\nthe scaffold was decently cleared, and fresh baize laid upon the block,\r\nand saw-dust strewed, that none of the blood might appear to shock the\r\nunhappy man who was to succeed the young and gallant Derwentwater in\r\nthat tragic scene.\r\n\r\nLord Kenmure then advanced. He was formally delivered from the hands of\r\none sheriff to those of the other, who had continued on the stage on\r\nwhich the scaffold was erected all the time, and who then addressed the\r\ncondemned man. The first question related to the presence of clergy, and\r\nof other friends; and Lord Kenmure stated, in reply, that he had the\r\nassistance of two clergymen, and desired the presence of some friends\r\nwho were below. These persons were then called up, and Lord Kenmure\r\nretired with his friends and the two clergymen to the south side of the\r\nstage, where they joined in penitential prayers, some of them written\r\nfor the occasion, and others out of a printed book, not improbably the\r\nBook of Common Prayer, since Lord Kenmure was a Protestant and an\r\nEpiscopalian. Lord Kenmure employed himself for some time in private\r\nsupplications; and afterwards a clergyman, in a prayer, recommended the\r\ndying man to the mercy of God. A requiem completed the devotions of the\r\nunfortunate Kenmure.\r\n\r\nSir John Fryer, one of the sheriffs, then inquired if his Lordship had\r\nhad sufficient time; and expressed his willingness to wait as long as\r\nLord Kenmure wished. He also requested to know if Lord Kenmure had\r\nanything to say in private; to these questions a negative was returned.\r\n\r\nThe executioner now came forward. Lord Kenmure was accompanied by an\r\nundertaker, to whom the care of his body was to be entrusted; he was\r\nalso attended by a surgeon, who directed the executioner how to perform\r\nhis office, by drawing his finger over that part of the neck where the\r\nblow was to be given. Lord Kenmure then kissed the officers and\r\ngentlemen on the scaffold, some of them twice and thrice; and being\r\nagain asked if he had anything to say, answered, \"No.\" He had specified\r\nthe Chevalier St. George in his prayers, and he now repeated his\r\nrepentance for having pleaded guilty at his trial. He turned to the\r\nexecutioner, who, according to the usual form, asked forgiveness. \"My\r\nLord,\" said the man, \"what I do, is to serve the nation; do you forgive\r\nme?\" \"I do,\" replied Lord Kenmure; and he placed the sum of eight\r\nguineas in the hands of the headsman. The final preparations were\r\ninstantly made. Lord Kenmure pulled off, unassisted, his coat and\r\nwaistcoat: one of his friends put a white linen cap on his head; and the\r\nexecutioner turned down the collar of his shirt, in order to avoid all\r\nobstacles to the fatal stroke. Then the executioner said, \"My Lord, will\r\nyou be pleased to try the block?\" Lord Kenmure, in reply, laid down his\r\nhead on the block, and spread forth his hands. The headsman instantly\r\nperformed his office. The usual words, \"This is the head of a traitor!\"\r\nwere heard as the executioner displayed the streaming and ghastly sight\r\nto the multitude.\r\n\r\nThe body of Lord Kenmure, after being first deposited at an undertaker's\r\nin Fleet Street, was carried to Scotland, and there buried among his\r\nancestors. A letter was found in his pocket addressed to the Chevalier,\r\nrecommending to him the care of his children; but it was suppressed.[41]\r\n\r\nThus died one of those men, whose honour, had his life been spared,\r\nmight have been trusted never again to enter into any scheme injurious\r\nto the reigning Government; and whose death inspires, perhaps, more\r\nunmitigated regret than that of any of the Jacobite lords. Lord\r\nKenmure's short-lived authority was sullied by no act of cruelty; and\r\nhis last hours were those of a pious, resigned, courageous Christian. He\r\nwas thrust into a situation as commander in the South, peculiarly\r\nunfitted for his mild, reserved, and modest disposition: and he was thus\r\ncarried away from that private sphere which he was calculated to\r\nadorn.[42]\r\n\r\nAfter her husband's death, the energies of Lady Kenmure were directed to\r\nsecure the estates of Kenmure to her eldest son. She instantly posted\r\ndown to Scotland, and reached Kenmure Castle in time to secure the most\r\nvaluable papers. When the estates were put up for sale, she contrived,\r\nwith the assistance of her friends, to raise money enough to purchase\r\nthem; and lived so carefully as to be able to deliver them over to her\r\nson, clear of all debt, when he came of age. Four children were left\r\ndependent upon her exertions and maternal protection. Of these Robert,\r\nthe eldest, died in 1741 unmarried, in his twenty-eighth year. James\r\nalso died unmarried. Harriet, the only daughter, was married to her\r\nmother's cousin-german, Captain James Dalzell, uncle of Robert Earl of\r\nCarnwath. John Gordon, the second and only surviving son of Lord\r\nKenmure, married, in 1744, the Lady Frances Mackenzie, daughter of the\r\nEarl of Seaforth; and from this marriage is descended the present\r\nViscount Kenmure, to whom the estate was restored in 1824.\r\n\r\nLady Kenmure survived her husband sixty-one years. In 1747, she appears\r\nto have resided in Paris, where, after the commotions of 1745, she\r\nprobably took refuge. Here, aged as she must have been, the spirit of\r\njustice, and the love of consistency were shewn in an anecdote related\r\nof her by Drummond of Bochaldy, who was mingled up in the cabals of the\r\nmelancholy Court of St. Germains. It had become the fashion among Prince\r\nCharles's sycophants and favourites, to declare that it was not for the\r\ninterest of the party that there should be any restoration while King\r\nJames lived; this idea was diligently circulated by Kelly, a man\r\ndescribed by Drummond as full of trick, falsehood, deceit, and\r\nimposition; and joined to these, having qualities that make up a\r\nthorough sycophant.\r\n\r\nIt was Kelly's fashion to toast the Prince in all companies first, and\r\ndeclare that the King could not last long. At one of the entertainments,\r\nwhich he daily frequented, at the house of Lady Redmond, the dinner,\r\nwhich usually took place at noon, being later than usual, Lady Kenmure,\r\nin making an afternoon's visit, came in before dinner was over. She was\r\nsoon surprised and shocked to hear the company drinking the Prince's\r\nhealth without mentioning the King's. \"Lady Kenmure,\" adds Drummond,\r\n\"could not bear it, and said it was new to her to see people forget the\r\nduty due to the King.\" Kelly immediately answered, \"Madam, you are old\r\nfashioned; these fashions are out of date.\" She said that she really was\r\nold fashioned, and hoped God would preserve her always sense and duty\r\nenough to continue so; on which she took a glass and said \"God preserve\r\nour King, and grant him long life, and a happy reign over us!\"[43]\r\n\r\nLady Kenmure died on the 16th of August, 1776, at Terregles, in\r\nDumfriesshire, the seat of the Nithisdale family.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] Patten, p. 52\r\n\r\n[38] Patten.

Presented to the\r\nAbbotsford Club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MURRAY, MARQUIS OF TULLIBARDINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the nobility who hastened to the hunting-field of Braemar, was\r\nWilliam Marquis of Tullibardine and eldest son of the first Duke of\r\nAthole.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the powerful family of Murray commences with Sir William\r\nDe Moraira, who was Sheriff in Perth in 1222, in the beginning of the\r\nreign of King Alexander the Second. The lands of Tullibardine were\r\nobtained by the Knight in 1282, by his marriage with Adda, the daughter\r\nof Malise, Seneschal of Stratherio. After the death of William De\r\nMoraira, the name of this famous house merged into that of Murray, and\r\nits chieftains were for several centuries known by the appellation of\r\nMurray of Tullibardine. It was not until the seventeenth century that\r\nthe family of Murray was ennobled, when James the Sixth created Sir John\r\nMurray Earl of Tullibardine.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate subject of this memoir was the son of one of the most\r\nzealous promoters of the Revolution of 1688. His father, nearly\r\nconnected in blood with William the Third, was appointed to the command\r\nof a regiment by that Monarch, and entrusted with several posts of\r\ngreat importance, which he retained in the time of Queen Anne, until a\r\nplot was formed to ruin him by Lord Lovat, who endeavoured to implicate\r\nthe Duke in the affair commonly known by the name of the Queensbury\r\nplot. The Duke of Athole courted inquiry upon that occasion; but the\r\nbusiness having been dropped without investigation, he resigned the\r\noffice of Privy Seal, which he then held, and became a warm opponent of\r\nthe Act of Union which was introduced into Parliament in 1705.\r\n\r\nAfter this event the Duke of Athole retired to Perthshire, and there\r\nlived in great magnificence until, upon the Tories coming into power, he\r\nwas chosen one of the representatives of the Scottish peerage in 1710,\r\nand afterwards a second time constituted Lord Privy Seal.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that, beholding his father thus cherished by Government,\r\nthe Marquis of Tullibardine should have adopted the cause of the\r\nChevalier: and not, as it appears, from a momentary caprice, but, if we\r\ntake into consideration the conduct of his whole life, from a fixed and\r\nunalienable conviction. At the time of the first Rebellion, the Marquis\r\nwas twenty-seven years of age; he may therefore be presumed to have been\r\nmature in judgment, and to have passed over the age of wild enthusiasm.\r\nThe impulses of fanaticism had no influence in promoting the adoption of\r\na party to which an Episcopalian as well as a Roman Catholic might\r\nprobably be peculiarly disposed. Lord Tullibardine had been brought up a\r\nPresbyterian; his father was so firm and zealous in that faith, as to\r\nexcite the doubts of the Tory party, to whom he latterly attached\r\nhimself, of his sincerity in their cause. According to Lord Lovat, the\r\narch-enemy of the Athole family, the Duke had not any considerable\r\nportion of that quality in his character, which Lord Lovat represents as\r\none compound of meanness, treachery, and revenge, and attributes the\r\nhatred with which Athole persecuted the brave and unfortunate Duke of\r\nArgyle, to the circumstance of his having received a blow from that\r\nnobleman before the whole Court at Edinburgh, without having the spirit\r\nto return the insult.[44]\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the same authority, that the loyalty which the Duke of\r\nAthole professed towards King William was of a very questionable\r\ndescription. It becomes, indeed, very difficult to ascertain what were\r\nreally the Duke of Athole's political tenets. Under these conflicting\r\nand unsettled opinions the young Marquis of Tullibardine was reared.\r\n\r\nThere seems little reason to doubt that his father, the Duke of Athole,\r\ncontinued to act a double part in the troublous days which followed the\r\naccession of George the First. It was, of course, of infinite importance\r\nto Government to secure the allegiance of so powerful a family as that\r\nof Murray, the head of whom was able to bring a body of six thousand men\r\ninto the field. It nevertheless soon appeared that the young heir of the\r\nhouse of Athole had imbibed very different sentiments to those with\r\nwhich it was naturally supposed a nobleman, actually in office at that\r\ntime, would suffer in his eldest son. The first act of the Marquis was\r\nto join the Earl of Mar with two thousand men, clansmen from the\r\nHighlands, and with fourteen hundred of the Duke of Athole's\r\ntenants;[45] his next, to proclaim the Chevalier King. Almost\r\nsimultaneously, and whilst his tenantry were following their young\r\nleader to the field, the Duke of Athole was proclaiming King George at\r\nPerth.[46] The Duke was ordered, meantime, by the authorities, to remain\r\nat his Castle of Blair to secure the peace of the county, of which he\r\nwas Lord-Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Tullibardine's name appears henceforth in most of the\r\nevents of the Rebellion. There exists little to shew how he acquitted\r\nhimself in the engagement of Sherriff Muir, where he led several\r\nbattalions to the field; but he shewed his firmness and valour by\r\nremaining for some time at the head of his vassals, after the unhappy\r\ncontest of 1715 was closed by the ignominious flight of the Chevalier.\r\nAll hope of reviving the Jacobite party being then extinct for a time,\r\nthe Marquis escaped to France, where he remained in tranquillity for a\r\nfew years; but his persevering endeavours to aid the Stuart cause were\r\nonly laid aside, and not abandoned.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence, the fortunes of the house of Athole sustained no\r\nimportant change. The office of Privy Seal was, it is true, taken from\r\nthe Duke and given to the Marquis of Annandale; but by the favour of\r\nGovernment the estates escaped forfeiture, and during the very year in\r\nwhich the Rebellion occurred, the honours and lands which belonged to\r\nthe unfortunate Tullibardine were vested, by the intercession of his\r\nfather, in a younger son, Lord James Murray. The effect of this may have\r\nbeen to render the Marquis still more determined in his adherence to the\r\nStuart line. He was not, however, the only member of the house of Murray\r\nwho participated in the Jacobite cause.\r\n\r\nNo less consistent in his opinions than the Marquis of Tullibardine,\r\nWilliam, the second Lord Nairn, came forward to espouse the cause of the\r\nStuarts. This nobleman was the uncle of Lord Tullibardine, and bore,\r\nbefore his marriage with Margaret, only daughter of the first Lord\r\nNairn, the appellation of Lord William Murray. The title was, however,\r\nsettled by patent upon him and his heirs; and this obligation, conferred\r\nby Charles the Second, was bestowed upon one whose gratitude and\r\ndevotion to the line of Stuart ceased only with his life. Lord Nairn had\r\nbeen educated to the naval service, and had distinguished himself for\r\nbravery. He refused the oaths at the Revolution, and consequently did\r\nnot take his seat in Parliament. His wife, Margaret, appears to have\r\nshared in her husband's enthusiasm, and to have resembled him in\r\ncourage. In the Earl of Mar's correspondence frequent allusion is made\r\nto her under the name of Mrs. Mellor. \"I wish,\" says the Earl on one\r\noccasion, \"our men had her spirit.\" And the remembrances which he sends\r\nher, and his recurrence to her, show how important a personage Lady\r\nNairn must have been. Aided by these two influential relations, the\r\nMarquis of Tullibardine had engaged in the dangerous game which cost\r\nScotland so dear. Upon the close of the Rebellion, Lord Nairn was not so\r\nfortunate as to escape to France with his relation. He was taken\r\nprisoner, tried, and condemned to be executed. At his trial he pleaded\r\nguilty; but he was respited, and afterwards pardoned. His wife and\r\nchildren were eventually provided for out of the forfeited estate; but\r\nneither punishment nor favour prevented his sons from sharing in the\r\nRebellion of 1745.\r\n\r\nAnother individual who participated in the Rebellion of 1715 was Lord\r\nCharles Murray, the fourth surviving son of the Duke of Athole, and one\r\nof those gallant, fine-tempered soldiers, whose graceful bearing and\r\ngood qualities win upon the esteem even of their enemies. At the\r\nbeginning of the Rebellion, Lord Charles was an officer on half-pay in\r\nthe British service; he quickly joined the insurgent army, and obtained\r\nthe command of a regiment. Such was his determination to share all\r\ndangers and difficulties with his troops, that he never could be\r\nprevailed upon to ride at the head of his regiment, but went in his\r\nHighland dress, on foot, throughout the marches. This young officer\r\ncrossed the Forth with General Mackintosh, and joined the Northumbrian\r\ninsurgents in the march to Preston. At the siege of that town Lord\r\nCharles defended one of the barriers, and repelled Colonel Dormer's\r\nbrigade from the attack. He was afterwards made prisoner at the\r\nsurrender, tried by a court-martial, and sentenced to be shot as a\r\ndeserter from the British army. He was, however, subsequently reprieved,\r\nbut died only five years afterwards.[47]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Tullibardine was not, however, the only Jacobite member\r\nof the family who had been spared after the Rebellion of 1715, to renew\r\nhis efforts in the cause. His brother, the celebrated Lord George\r\nMurray, was also deeply engaged in the same interests. In 1719, the\r\nhopes of the party were revived by the war with Spain, and their\r\ninvasion of Great Britain was quietly planned by the Duke of Ormond, who\r\nhastened to Madrid to hold conferences with Alberoni. Shortly afterwards\r\nthe Chevalier was received in that capital, and treated as King of\r\nEngland. In March, 1719, the ill-fated expedition under the Duke of\r\nOrmond was formed, and a fleet, destined never to reach its appointed\r\nplace of rendezvous, sailed from Cadiz.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise met with the usual fate of all the attempts formed in\r\nfavour of the Stuarts. With the exception of two frigates, none of the\r\nships proceeded farther than Cape Finisterre, where they were disabled\r\nby a storm. These two vessels reached the coast of Scotland, having on\r\nboard of them the Earl of Seaforth, the Earl Marischal, the Marquis of\r\nTullibardine,[48] three hundred Spaniards, and arms for two thousand\r\nmen. They landed at the island of Lewes, but found the body of the\r\nJacobite party resolved not to move until all the forces under Ormond\r\nshould be assembled. During this interval of suspense, disputes between\r\nthe Marquis of Tullibardine and the Lord Marischal, which should have\r\nthe command, produced the usual effects among a divided and factious\r\nparty, of checking exertion by diminishing confidence.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that the Marquis had a commission from the\r\nChevalier to invade Scotland; in virtue of which he left the island of\r\nLewes, whence he had for some time been carrying on a correspondence\r\nwith the Highland chieftains, and landed with the three hundred\r\nSpaniards on the main land. The Ministers of George the First lost no\r\ntime in repelling this attempt by a foreign power, and it is singular\r\nthat they employed Dutch troops for the purpose; and that Scotland, for\r\nthe first time, beheld her rights contested by soldiers speaking\r\ndifferent languages, and natives of different continental regions. The\r\nGovernment had brought over two thousand Dutch soldiers, and six\r\nbattalions of Imperial troops from the Austrian Netherlands, and these\r\nwere now sent down to Inverness, where General Wightman was stationed.\r\nAs soon as he was informed of the landing of the Spanish forces, that\r\ncommander marched his troops to Glenshiel, a place between Fort Augustus\r\nand Benera. He attacked the invaders: the Highlanders were quickly\r\nrepulsed and fled to their hills; the Spaniards were taken prisoners;\r\nbut the Marquis of Tullibardine and the Earl of Seaforth escaped, and,\r\nretreating to the island of Lewes, again escaped to France.\r\n\r\nDuring twenty-six years the Marquis of Tullibardine, against whom an act\r\nof attainder was passed, remained in exile. He appears to have avoided\r\ntaking any active part in political affairs. \"These seven or eight\r\nyears,\" he says in a letter addressed to the Chevalier, \"have\r\nsufficiently shewn me how unfit I am for meddling with the deep concerns\r\nof state.\"[49] He resided at Puteaux, a small town near Paris, until\r\ncalled imperatively from his retreat.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of inaction, no measures were taken to reconcile those\r\nwhom he had left, the more gallant portion of the Highlanders, to the\r\nEnglish Government. \"The state of arms,\" says Mr. Home, \"was allowed to\r\nremain the same; the Highlanders lived under their chiefs, in arms; the\r\npeople of England and the Lowlanders of Scotland lived, without arms,\r\nunder their sheriffs and magistrates; so that every rebellion was a war\r\ncarried on by the Highlanders against the standing army; and a\r\ndeclaration of war with France or Spain, which required the service of\r\nthe troops abroad, was a signal for a rebellion at home. Strange as it\r\nmay seem, it was actually so.\"[50]\r\n\r\nDuring the interval between the two Rebellions of 1715 and 1745, the\r\narts of peace were cultivated in England, and the national wealth\r\naugmented; but no portion of that wealth altered the habits of the\r\nHighland chieftains, who, looking continually for another rebellion,\r\nestimated their property by the number of men whom they could bring into\r\nthe field. An anecdote, illustrative of this peculiarity, is told of\r\nMacdonald of Keppoch, who was killed at the battle of Culloden. Some\r\nlow-country gentlemen were visiting him in 1740, and were entertained\r\nwith the lavish hospitality of a Highland home. One of these guests\r\nventured to ask of the landlord, what was the rent of his estate. \"I can\r\nbring five hundred men into the field,\" was the reply. It was estimated,\r\nabout this time, that the whole force which could be raised by the\r\nHighlanders amounted to no more than twelve thousand men; yet, with this\r\ninconsiderable number, the Jacobites could shake the British throne.\r\n\r\nThe danger which might arise to the Government, in case of a foreign\r\nwar, from the Highlanders, was foreseen by Duncan Forbes of Culloden,\r\nand a scheme was formed by that good and great man, and communicated to\r\nLord Hay, adapted to reconcile the chieftains to the sovereignty of the\r\nhouse of Hanover, and at the same time to preserve the peace of the\r\ncountry. This was, to raise four or five Highland regiments, appointing\r\nan English or Scotch officer of undoubted loyalty to King George, to be\r\ncolonel of each regiment, and naming all the inferior officers from a\r\nlist drawn up by President Forbes, and comprising all the chiefs and\r\nchieftains of the disaffected clans. Most unhappily this plan was\r\nrejected. Had it been adopted, the melancholy events of the last\r\nRebellion might not have left an indelible stain upon our national\r\ncharacter. The Highlanders, once enlisted in the cause of Government,\r\nwould have been true to their engagements; and the fidelity of the\r\nofficers, when serving abroad, would have been a guarantee for the good\r\nconduct of their relations at home. It was not, however, deemed\r\npracticable; and the energies of a determined and unemployed people were\r\nagain brought into active force. It is said to have met with the decided\r\napprobation of Sir Robert Walpole, but it was negatived by the\r\nCabinet.[51]\r\n\r\nThe year 1739 witnessed the revival of the Jacobite Association, which\r\nhad been annihilated by the attainders and exiles of its members after\r\nthe last Rebellion. The declaration of war between Spain and England,\r\ninduced a belief that hostilities with France would follow; and\r\naccordingly, in 1740, seven persons of distinction met at Edinburgh, and\r\nsigned an association, which was to be carried to the Chevalier St.\r\nGeorge at Rome, together with a list of those chiefs and chieftains who\r\nwere ready to join the association, if a body of French troops should\r\nland in Scotland. This was the commencement of the second Rebellion; and\r\nit was seconded with as pure a spirit of devotion to the cause, as\r\nexalted an enthusiasm, as if none had bled on the scaffold in the\r\nprevious reign, or attainders and forfeitures had never visited with\r\npoverty and ruin the adherents of James Stuart.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Tullibardine was selected as one of the attendants of\r\nCharles Edward, in the perilous enterprise of the invasion. He was the\r\nperson of the highest rank among those who accompanied the gallant and\r\nunfortunate adventurer in his voyage from the mouth of the Loire to\r\nScotland, in a little vessel, La Doutelle, with its escort of a ship of\r\nseven hundred tons, the Elizabeth. During this voyage the strictest\r\nincognito was preserved by the Prince, who was dressed in the habit of\r\nthe Scotch College, at Paris, and who suffered his beard to grow, in\r\norder still better to disguise himself. At night the ship sailed without\r\na light, except that which proceeded from the compass, and which was\r\nclosely covered, the more effectually to defy pursuit. As it tracked the\r\nocean, with its guardian, the Elizabeth, the sight of a British\r\nman-of-war off Lizard Point excited the ardour of the youthful hero on\r\nboard of La Doutelle. Captain D'Eau, the commander of the Elizabeth,\r\ndetermined to attack the English ship, and requested the aid of Mr.\r\nWalsh, who commanded the Doutelle. His request was denied, probably from\r\nthe responsibility which would have been incurred by Walsh, if he had\r\nendangered the safety of the vessel in which the Prince sailed. The\r\nattack was therefore made by the brave D'Eau alone. It was succeeded by\r\na fight of two hours, during which the Doutelle looked on, while the\r\nPrince vainly solicited Walsh to engage in the action. The commander\r\nrefused, and threatened the royal youth to send him to his cabin if he\r\npersisted. Both ships were severely damaged in the encounter and La\r\nDoutelle was obliged to proceed on her way alone, the Elizabeth\r\nreturning to France to refit.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first of July, La Doutelle approached the remote range of\r\nthe Hebrides, comprehending Lewes, Uist, and Barra, often called, from\r\nbeing seen together, the Long Island. As the vessel neared the shore, a\r\nlarge Hebridean eagle hovered over the masts. The Marquis of\r\nTullibardine observed it, and attributed to its appearance that\r\nimportance to which the imagination of his countrymen gives to such\r\nincidents; yet, not wishing to appear superstitious, or to show what is\r\ncalled a \"Highland freit,\" it was not until the bird had followed the\r\nship's course for some time, that he drew the attention of the Prince to\r\nthe circumstance. As they returned on deck after dinner, he pointed out\r\nthe bird to Charles Edward, observing at the same time, \"Sir, I hope\r\nthis is a happy omen, and promises good things to us; the king of birds\r\nis come to welcome your Royal Highness, on your arrival in Scotland.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince and his followers landed, on the twenty-third of July, at the\r\nisland of Eriska, belonging to Clanranald, and situated between the\r\nIsles of Barra and of South Uist, their voyage having been accomplished\r\nin eighteen days. Here all the party landed, with the exception of the\r\nMarquis, who was laid up with the gout, and unable to move. His\r\ncondition was supposed to be one of peril, for two ships had been\r\nespied, and the Prince and his associates hurried off, with all the\r\nexpedition they could, to shore. The long boat was got out, and sent to\r\nprocure a pilot, who was discovered in the person of the hereditary\r\npiper of Clanranald, who piloted the precious freight safely to shore.\r\nThe two vessels which had produced so much alarm, proved afterwards to\r\nbe only merchant-vessels.\r\n\r\nIn these \"malignant regions,\" as Dr. Johnson describes them, referring\r\nto the severity of the climate and the poverty of the soil, Prince\r\nCharles and his adherents were lodged in a small country house, with a\r\nhole in the roof for a chimney, and a fire in the middle of the room.\r\nThe young adventurer, reared among the delicacies of the palace at\r\nAlbano, was often obliged to go to the door for fresh air. \"What a\r\nplague is the matter with that fellow,\" exclaimed Angus Macdonald, the\r\nlandlord, \"that he can neither sit nor stand still, nor keep within nor\r\nwithout doors?\" The night, it must be observed, was unusually wet and\r\nstormy, so that the Prince had no alternative between smoke and rain.\r\nThe pride of the Scotch, in this remote region, was exemplified in\r\nanother trifling occurrence: The Prince, who was less fatigued than the\r\nrest of the party, with that consideration for others, and disregard of\r\nhis own personal comfort, which formed at this period so beautiful a\r\npart of his character, insisted that his attendants should retire to\r\nrest. He took a particular care of Sir Thomas Sheridan, his tutor, and\r\nexamined closely the bed appropriated to him, in order to see that it\r\nwas well aired. The landlord, indignant at this investigation, called\r\nout to him, \"That the bed was so good, and the sheets were so good, that\r\na prince might sleep in them.\"[52]\r\n\r\nThe farm-house in which this little incident took place, and which first\r\nreceived the Prince, who was destined to occupy so great a variety of\r\ndwellings in Scotland, was situated in Borrodale, a wild, mountainous\r\ntract of country, which forms a tongue of land between two bays.\r\nBorrodale, being difficult of access, was well-chosen as the\r\nlanding-place of Charles; whilst around, in most directions, were the\r\nwell-wishers to his cause.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Tullibardine accompanied Charles in his progress until\r\nthe Prince landed at Glenfinnin,[53] which is situated about twenty\r\nmiles from Fort William, and forms the outlet from Moidart to Lochaber;\r\nhere the standard of Charles Edward was unfurled. The scene in which\r\nthis ill-omened ceremonial took place is a deep and narrow valley, in\r\nwhich the river Finnin runs between high and craggy mountains, which are\r\ninaccessible to every species of carriage, and only to be surmounted by\r\ntravellers on foot. At each end of the vale is a lake of about twelve\r\nmiles in length, and behind the stern mountains which enclose the glen,\r\nare salt-water lakes, one of them an arm of the sea. The river Finnin\r\nempties itself into the Lake of Glenshiel, at the extremity of the glen.\r\nOn the eighteenth of August Prince Charles crossed this lake, slept at\r\nGlensiarick, and on the nineteenth proceeded to Glenfinnin.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles landed in the glen, he gazed around anxiously for Cameron\r\nof Lochiel, the younger, whom he expected to have joined him. He looked\r\nfor some time in vain; that faithful adherent was not then in sight, nor\r\nwas the glen, as the Prince had expected, peopled by any of the clansmen\r\nwhose gathering he had expected. A few poor people from the little knot\r\nof hovels, which was called the village, alone greeted the ill-starred\r\nadventurer. Disconcerted, Prince Charles entered one of the hovels,\r\nwhich are still standing, and waited there for about two hours. At the\r\nend of that time, the notes of the pibroch were heard, and presently,\r\ndescending from the summit of a hill, appeared the Camerons, advancing\r\nin two lines, each of them three men deep. Between the lines walked the\r\nprisoners of war, who had been taken some days previously near Loch\r\nLochiel.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, exhilarated by the sight of six or seven hundred brave\r\nHighlanders, immediately gave orders for the standard to be unfurled.\r\n\r\nThe office of honour was entrusted to the Marquis of Tullibardine, on\r\naccount of his high rank and importance to the cause. The spot chosen\r\nfor the ceremony was a knoll in the centre of the vale. Upon this little\r\neminence the Marquis stood, supported on either side by men, for his\r\nhealth was infirm, and what we should now call a premature old age was\r\nfast approaching. The banner which it was his lot to unfurl displayed no\r\nmotto, nor was there inscribed upon it the coffin and the crown which\r\nthe vulgar notion in England assigned to it. It was simply a large\r\nbanner of red silk, with a white space in the middle. The Marquis held\r\nthe staff until the Manifesto of the Chevalier and the Commission of\r\nRegency had been read. In a few hours the glen in which this solemnity\r\nhad been performed, was filled not only with Highlanders, but with\r\nladies and gentlemen to admire the spectacle. Among them was the\r\ncelebrated Miss, or, more properly, Mrs. Jeanie Cameron, whose\r\npassionate attachment for the Prince rendered her so conspicuous in the\r\ntroublous period of 1745. The description given of her in Bishop\r\nForbes's Jacobite Memoirs destroys much of the romance of the story\r\ncommonly related of her. \"She is a widow,\" he declares, \"nearer fifty\r\nthan forty years of age. She is a genteel, well-looking, handsome woman,\r\nwith a pair of pretty eyes, and hair black as jet. She is of a very\r\nsprightly genius, and is very agreeable in conversation. She was so far\r\nfrom accompanying the Prince's army, that she went off with the rest of\r\nthe spectators as soon as the army marched; neither did she ever follow\r\nthe camp, nor ever was with the Prince in private, except when he was in\r\nEdinburgh.\"[54]\r\n\r\nSoon after the unfurling of the standard, we find the Marquis of\r\nTullibardine writing to Mrs. Robertson of Lude, a daughter of Lord\r\nNairn, and desiring her to put the Castle of Blair into some order, and\r\nto do honours of the place when the Prince should come there. The\r\nMarquis, it is here proper to mention, was regarded by all the Jacobites\r\nas still the head of his house, and uniformly styled by that party the\r\n\"Duke of Athole,\" yet he seldom adopted the title himself; and in only\r\none or two instances in his correspondence does the signature of Athole\r\noccur.[55]\r\n\r\nOn the thirty-first of August the Prince visited the famous Blair\r\nAthole, or Field of Athole, the word _Blair_ signifying a pleasant land,\r\nand being descriptive of that beautiful vale situated in the midst of\r\nwild and mountainous scenery.\r\n\r\nAfter riding along a black moor, in sight of vast mountains, the castle,\r\na plain massive white house, appears in view. It is seated on an\r\neminence above a plain watered by the Gary, called, by Pennant, \"an\r\noutrageous stream, which laves and rushes along vast beds of gravel on\r\nthe valley below.\"\r\n\r\nThe approach to Blair Castle winds up a very steep and high hill, and\r\nthrough a great birch wood, forming a most picturesque scene, from the\r\npendent form of the boughs waving with the wind from the bottom to the\r\nutmost summits of the mountains. On attaining the top, a view of the\r\nbeautiful little Straith, fertile and wooded, with the river in the\r\nmiddle, delights the beholder. The stream, after meandering in various\r\ncircles, suddenly swells into a lake that fills the vale from side to\r\nside; this lake is about three miles long, and retains the name of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Charles visited Blair, it was a fortified house, and capable\r\nof holding out a siege afterwards against his adherents. Its height was\r\nconsequently lowered, but the inside has been finished with care by the\r\nducal owner. The environs of this beautiful place are thus described by\r\nthe graphic pen of Pennant,[56] whose description of them, having been\r\nwritten in 1769, is more likely to apply to the state in which it was\r\nwhen Prince Charles beheld it, than that of any more modern traveller.\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Athoel's estate is very extensive, and the country\r\npopulous; while vassalage existed, the chieftain could raise two or\r\nthree thousand fighting-men, and leave sufficient at home to take care\r\nof the ground. The forests, or rather chases, (for they are quite\r\nnaked,) are very extensive, and feed vast numbers of stags, which range\r\nat certain times of the year in herds of five hundred. Some grow to a\r\ngreat size. The hunting of these animals was formerly after the manner\r\nof an Eastern monarch. Thousands of vassals surrounded a great tract of\r\ncountry, and drove the deer to the spot where the chieftains were\r\nstationed, who shot them at their leisure.\r\n\r\n\"Near the house is a fine walk surrounding a very deep glen, finely\r\nwooded, but in dry weather deficient in water at the bottom; but on the\r\nside of the walk on the rock is a small crystalline fountain, inhabited\r\nat that time by a pair of Naiads, in the form of golden fish.\r\n\r\n\"In a spruce-fir was a hang-nest of some unknown bird, suspended at the\r\nfour corners to the boughs; it was open at top an inch and a half in\r\ndiameter, and two deep; the sides and bottom thick, the materials moss,\r\nworsted, and birch-bark, lined with hair and feathers. The stream\r\naffords the parr,[57] a small species of trout seldom exceeding eight\r\ninches in length, marked on the sides with nine large bluish spots, and\r\non the lateral line with small red ones. No traveller should omit\r\nvisiting Yorke Cascade, a magnificent cataract, amidst most suitable\r\nscenery, about a mile distant from the house. This country is very\r\nmountainous, has no natural woods, except of birch; but the vast\r\nplantations that begin to cloath the hills will amply supply these\r\ndefects.\"[58]\r\n\r\nWith what sensations must the Marquis of Tullibardine have approached\r\nthis beautiful and princely territory, from which he had been excluded,\r\nhis vassals becoming the vassals of a younger brother, and he a\r\nproscribed and aged man, visiting as an alien the home of his youth!\r\n\r\nSanguine hopes, however, perhaps mitigated the bitterness of the\r\nreflections with which the faithful and disinterested Marquis of\r\nTullibardine once more found himself within the precincts of his proud\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nSeveral anecdotes are told of Prince Charles at Blair; among others,\r\n\"that when the Prince was at the Castle, he went into the garden, and\r\ntaking a walk upon the bowling-green, he said he had never seen a\r\nbowling-green before; upon which Mrs. Robertson of Lude called for some\r\nbowls that he might see them, but he told her that he had had a present\r\nof bowls sent him, as a curiosity, to Rome from England.\"[59]\r\n\r\nOn the second of September, the Prince left Blair and went to the house\r\nof Lude, where he was very cheerful, and took his share in several\r\ndances, such as minuets and Highland reels; the first reel the Prince\r\ncalled for was, \"This is no' mine ain House;\" he afterwards commanded a\r\nStrathspey minuet to be danced.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, while dining at Dunkeld, some of the company\r\nhappened to observe what a thoughtful state his father would now be in\r\nfrom the consideration of those dangers and difficulties which he had to\r\nencounter, and remarked that upon this account he was much to be pitied,\r\nbecause his mind must be much upon the rack. The Prince replied, that he\r\ndid not half so much pity his father as his brother;[60] \"for,\" (he\r\nsaid) \"the King has been inured to disappointments and distresses, and\r\nhas learnt to bear up easily under the misfortunes of life; but, poor\r\nHarry!--his young and tender years make him much to be pitied, for few\r\nbrothers love as we do.\"\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of September, Prince Charles entered Perth; the Marquis of\r\nTullibardine, as it appears from several letters addressed to him by\r\nLord George Murray, who wrote from Perth, remained at Blair, but only,\r\nas it is evident from the following extract from a letter by Lord George\r\nMurray, whilst awaiting the arrangement of active operations. On the\r\ntwenty-second of September he received a commission from the Prince,\r\nconstituting and appointing him Commander-in-Chief of the forces north\r\nof the Forth; the active duties of the post were, however, fulfilled by\r\nLord George Murray, who writes in the character of a general:[61]\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Brother,\r\n\r\n    \"Things vary so much from time to time, that I can say nothing\r\n    certain as yet, but refer you to the enclosed letter; but depend\r\n    upon having another express from me with you before Monday night.\r\n    But in the meantime you must resolve to be ready to march on Tuesday\r\n    morning, by Keinacan and Tay Bridge, so as to be at Crieff on\r\n    Wednesday, and even that way, if you do your best, you will be half\r\n    a mark behind; but you will be able to make that up on Thursday,\r\n    when I reckon we may meet at Dumblane, or Doun; but of this more\r\n    fully in my next. It is believed for certain, that Cope will embark\r\n    at Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n    \"I hope the meal was with you this day, thirty-five bolls,--for it\r\n    was at Invar last night. It shall be my study to have more meal with\r\n    you on Monday night, for you must distribute a peck a man; and cost\r\n    what it will, there must be frocks made to each man to contain a\r\n    peck or two for the men to have always with them.\r\n\r\n    \"Buy linen, yarn, or anything, for these frocks are of absolute\r\n    necessity--nothing can be done without them. His Royal Highness\r\n    desires you to acquaint Glenmoriston and Glenco, if they come your\r\n    way of this intended march, so that they may go by Taybridge (if you\r\n    please, with you), and what meal you can spare let them have. You\r\n    may please tell your own people that there is a project to get arms\r\n    for them. Yours. Adieu.\r\n\r\n                                                    \"George Murray.\"\r\n\r\nFrom his age and infirmities, the Marquis was precluded from taking an\r\nactive part in the long course of events which succeeded the unfurling\r\nof the standard at Glenfinnin. He appears to have exercised a gentle,\r\nbut certain sway over the conduct of others, and especially to have\r\npossessed a control over the high-spirited Lord George Murray, whose\r\nconduct he did not always approve.[62]\r\n\r\nWhilst at Blair, the Marquis was saluted as Duke of Athole by all who\r\nentered his house; but the honour was accompanied by some\r\nmortifications. His younger brother, the Duke of Athole, had taken care\r\nto carry away everything that could be conveyed, and to drive off every\r\nanimal that could be driven from his territory. The Marquis had\r\ntherefore great difficulty in providing even a moderate entertainment\r\nfor the Prince; whilst the army, now grown numerous, were almost\r\nstarving. \"The priests,\" writes a contemptuous opponent, \"never had a\r\nfitter opportunity to proclaim a general fast than the present. No bull\r\nof the Pope's would ever have been more certain of finding a most exact\r\nand punctual obedience.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Culloden had sealed the fate of the Jacobites, the\r\nMarquis of Tullibardine was forced, a second time, to seek a place of\r\nrefuge. He threw himself, unhappily, upon the mercy of one who little\r\ndeserved the confidence which was reposed in his honour, or merited the\r\nprivilege of succouring the unfortunate. The following are the\r\nparticulars of his fate:--\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks after the battle of Culloden the Marquis of\r\nTullibardine traversed the moors and mountains through Strathane in\r\nsearch of a place of safety and repose: he had become a very infirm old\r\nman, and so unfit for travelling on horseback, that he had a saddle made\r\non purpose, somewhat like a chair, in which he rode in the manner ladies\r\nusually do.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in the vicinity of Loch Lomond he was quite worn out, and\r\nrecollecting that a daughter of the family of Polmain (who were\r\nconnected with his own) was married to Buchanan of Drumakiln, who lived\r\nin a detached peninsula, running out into the lake, the fainting\r\nfugitive thought, on these accounts, that the place might be suitable\r\nfor a temporary refuge. The Marquis was attended by a French secretary,\r\ntwo servants of that nation, and two or three Highlanders, who had\r\nguided him through the solitary passes of the mountains. Against the\r\njudgment of these faithful attendants, he bent his course to the Ross,\r\nfor so the house of Drumakiln is called, where the Laird of Drumakiln\r\nwas living with his son. The Marquis, after alighting, begged to have a\r\nprivate interview with his cousin, the wife of Drumakiln; he told this\r\nlady he was come to put his life into her hands, and what, in some\r\nsense, he valued more than life, a small casket,[63] which he delivered\r\nto her, intreating her, whatever became of him, that she would keep that\r\ncarefully till demanded in his name, as it contained papers of\r\nconsequence to the honour and safety of many other persons. Whilst he\r\nwas thus talking, the younger Drumakiln rudely broke in upon him, and\r\nsnatching away the casket, he said he would secure it in a safe place,\r\nand went out. Meantime the French secretary and the servants were\r\nwatchful and alarmed at seeing the father and son walking in earnest\r\nconsultation, and observing horses saddled and dispatched with an air\r\nof mystery, whilst every one appeared to regard them with compassion.\r\nAll this time the Marquis was treated with seeming kindness; but his\r\nattendants suspected some snare. They burst into loud lamentations, and\r\nwere described by some children, who observed them, to be 'greeting and\r\nroaring like women.' This incident the lady of Drumakiln (who was a\r\nperson of some capacity) afterwards told her neighbours as a strange\r\ninstance of effeminacy in these faithful adherents.\r\n\r\nAt night the secretary went secretly to his master's bedside, and\r\nassured him there was treachery. The Marquis answered he could believe\r\nno gentleman capable of such baseness, and at any rate he was incapable\r\nof escaping through such defiles as they had passed; he told him in that\r\ncase it could only aggravate his sorrow to see him also betrayed; and\r\nadvised him to go off immediately, which he did. Early in the morning a\r\nparty from Dumbarton, summoned for that purpose, arrived to carry the\r\nMarquis away prisoner. He bore his fate with calm magnanimity. The fine\r\nhorses which he brought with him were detained, and he and one attendant\r\nwho remained were mounted on some horses belonging to Drumakiln. Such\r\nwas the general sentiment of disgust with Drumakiln, that the officer\r\nwho commanded the party taunted that gentleman in the bitterest manner,\r\nand the commander of Dumbarton Castle, who treated his noble prisoner\r\nwith the utmost respect and compassion, regarded Drumakiln with the\r\ncoldest disdain. The following anecdotes of the odium which Drumakiln\r\nincurred, are related by Mrs. Grant.[64]\r\n\r\n\"Very soon after the Marquis had departed, young Drumakiln mounted the\r\nMarquis's horse, (the servant riding another which had belonged to that\r\nnobleman,) and set out to a visit to his father-in-law Polmaise.\r\n\r\n\"When he alighted, he gave his horse to a groom who, knowing the Marquis\r\nwell, recognised him--'Come in poor beast (said he); times are changed\r\nwith you since you carried a noble Marquis, but you shall always be\r\ntreated well here for his sake.' Drumakiln ran in to his father-in-law,\r\ncomplaining that his servant insulted him. Polmaise made no answer, but\r\nturning on his heel, rang the bell for the servant, saying, 'That\r\ngentleman's horses.'\r\n\r\n\"After this and several other rebuffs the father and son began to shrink\r\nfrom the infamy attached to this proceeding. There was at that time only\r\none newspaper published at Edinburgh, conducted by the well-known\r\nRuddiman; to this person the elder Drumakiln addressed a letter or\r\nparagraph to be inserted in his paper, bearing that on such a day the\r\nMarquis surrendered to him at his house. This was regularly dated at\r\nRoss: very soon after the father and son went together to Edinburgh, and\r\nwaiting on the person appointed to make payments for affairs of this\r\nnature, demanded their reward. It should have been before observed,\r\nthat the Government were at this time not at all desirous to apprehend\r\nthe Marquis, though his name was the first inserted in the proclamation.\r\nThis capture indeed greatly embarrassed them, as it would be cruel to\r\npunish, and partial to pardon him. The special officer desired Drumakiln\r\nto return the next day for the money. Meanwhile he sent privately to\r\nRuddiman and examined him about the paragraph already mentioned. They\r\nfound it on his file, in the old Laird's handwriting, and delivered it\r\nto the commissioner. The commissioner delivered the paragraph, in his\r\nown handwriting, up to the elder, saying, '_There_ is an order to the\r\nTreasury, which ought to satisfy you,' and turned away from him with\r\nmarked contempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Soon after the younger laird was found dead in his bed, to which he had\r\nretired in usual health. Of five children which he left, it would shock\r\nhumanity to relate the wretched lives, and singular, and untimely\r\ndeaths, of whom, indeed, it might be said,\r\n\r\n    \"On all the line a sudden vengeance waits,\r\n    And frequent hearses shall besiege their gates.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they were literally considered by all the neighbourhood as caitiffs,\r\n\r\n               \"Whose breasts the furies steel'd\r\n    And curst with hearts unknowing how to yield.\"--POPE.\r\n\r\nThe blasting influence of more than dramatic justice, or of corroding\r\ninfamy, seemed to reach every branch of this devoted family. After the\r\nextinction of the direct male heirs, a brother, who was a captain in\r\nthe army, came home to take possession of the property. He was a person\r\nwell-respected in life, and possessed some talent, and much amenity of\r\nmanners. The country gentlemen, however, shunned and disliked him, on\r\naccount of the existing prejudice. This person, thus shunned and\r\nslighted, seemed to grow desperate, and plunged into the lowest and most\r\nabandoned profligacy. It is needless to enter into a detail of crimes\r\nwhich are hastening to desired oblivion. It is enough to observe that\r\nthe signal miseries of this family have done more to impress the people\r\nof that district with a horror of treachery, and a sense of retributive\r\njustice, than volumes of the most eloquent instruction could effect. On\r\nthe dark question relative to temporal judgments it becomes us not to\r\ndecide. Yet it is of some consequence, in a moral view, to remark how\r\nmuch all generous emulation, all hope of future excellence, is quenched\r\nin the human mind by the dreadful blot of imputed infamy.\"[65]\r\n\r\nThis account of the retributive justice of public opinion which was\r\nvisited upon Drumakiln, is confirmed by other authority.[66] It is\r\nconsolatory to reflect that the Marquis of Tullibardine, after a life\r\nspent in an honest devotion to the cause which he believed to be just,\r\nwas spared, by a merciful release, from the horrors of a public trial,\r\nand of a condemnation to the scaffold, which age and ill-health were not\r\nsufficient pleas to avert. After remaining some weeks in confinement at\r\nDumbarton, he was carried to Edinburgh, where he remained until the\r\nthirteenth of May, 1746. He was then put on board the Eltham man-of-war,\r\nlying in the Leith Roads, bound for London. His health all this time was\r\ndeclining, yet he had the inconvenience of a long sea voyage to sustain,\r\nfor the Eltham went north for other prisoners before it sailed for\r\nLondon. But at length the Marquis reached his last home, the Tower,\r\nwhere he arrived on the twenty-first of June. He survived only until the\r\nninth of July.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of this unfortunate nobleman, except what is honourable,\r\nconsistent, and amiable. He had almost ceased to be Scotch, except in\r\nhis attachments, and could scarcely write his own language. He seems to\r\nhave been generally respected; and he bore his reverses of fortune with\r\ncalmness and fortitude. In his last moments he is said to have declared,\r\nthat although he had been as much attached to the cause of James Stuart\r\nas any of his adherents, if he might now advise his countrymen, it\r\nshould be never more to enter into rebellious measures, for, having\r\nfailed in the last attempt, every future one would be hopeless.[68]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis died in the fifty-eighth year of his age, and was buried in\r\nthe chapel in the Tower, which has received few more honest men, or\r\npublic characters more true to the principles which they have professed.\r\n\r\nThe following letter, written in March, 1746, during the siege of Blair\r\nCastle, when it was commanded by a garrison under Sir Andrew Agnew, and\r\naddressed to Lord George Murray, shows the strong sense which the\r\nMarquis entertained of what was due to his country and his cause.\r\n\r\n    \"Brother George,\r\n\r\n    \"Since, contrary to the rules of right reason, you was pleased to\r\n    tell me a sham story about the expedition to Blair, without further\r\n    ceremony for me, you may now do what the gentlemen of the country\r\n    think fit with the castle: I am in no concern about it. Our\r\n    great-great-grandfather, grandfather, and father's pictures will be\r\n    an irreparable loss on blowing up the house; but there is no\r\n    comparison to be made with these faint images of our forefathers and\r\n    the more necessary publick service, which requires we should\r\n    sacrifice everything that can valuably contribute towards the\r\n    country's safety, as well as materially advancing the royal cause.\r\n    Pray give my kind service to all valuable friends, to which I can\r\n    add nothing but that, in all events, you may be assured I shall ever\r\n    be found with just regard, dear brother, your most affectionate\r\n    brother and humble servant.\"\r\n\r\n        \"Inverness,\r\n     \"March 26, 1746.\"\r\n\r\n    \"PS. At the upper end of the door of the old stable, there was\r\n    formerly a gate which had a portcullis into the castle; it is half\r\n    built up and boarded over on the stable side, large enough to hold a\r\n    horse at hack and manger. People that don't know the place imagine\r\n    it may be much easier dug through than any other part of the wall,\r\n    so as to make a convenient passage into the vaulted room, which is\r\n    called the servants' hall.\"\r\n\r\nOf the fate of this princely territory, and upon the fortunes of the\r\nfamily of which the Marquis of Tullibardine was so respectable a member,\r\nmuch remains to be related; but it appertains more properly to the life\r\nof the warlike and ambitious brother of the Marquis, the celebrated Lord\r\nGeorge Murray.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] Lord Lovat's Memoirs, p. 39.\r\n\r\n[45] Wood's Peerage.\r\n\r\n[46] Reay, p. 78.\r\n\r\n[47] Wood's Peerage.\r\n\r\n[48] See Brown's History of the Highlands.

Introductory Notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN MACLEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name Maclean, abbreviated from Mac Gillean, is derived from the\r\nfounder of the clan, \"Gillean n'a Tuaidh,\" Gillean of the Battle-axe, so\r\ncalled from his carrying with him as his ordinary weapon, a battle-axe.\r\nFrom this hero are descended the three principal families who compose\r\nthe clan Maclean, who was also designated Gillean of Duart.\r\n\r\nIt is related of Gillean that, being one day engaged in a stag-hunt on\r\nthe mountain of Bein't Sheala, and having wandered away from the rest of\r\nhis party, the mountain became suddenly enveloped in a deep mist, and\r\nthat he lost his track. For three days he wandered about; and, at length\r\nexhausted, threw himself under the shelter of a cranberry bush,\r\npreviously fixing the handle of his battle-axe in the earth. He was\r\ndiscovered by his party, who had been vainly endeavouring to find him,\r\ninsensible on the ground, with his arm round the handle of the\r\nbattle-axe, whilst the head of the weapon rose above the bush. Hence,\r\nprobably, the origin of the crest used by the clan Maclean, the\r\nbattle-axe surrounded by a laurel-branch.[69]\r\n\r\nTo Gillean of the Battle-axe various origins have been ascribed; truly\r\nis it observed, that \"there is little wisdom in attempting to thread the\r\nmazes of fanciful and traditionary genealogies.\"[70] Like other families\r\nof importance, in feudal times, the Macleans had their seneachie, or\r\nhistorian; and, by the last of these, Dr. John Beaton, the descent, in\r\nregular order, from Aonaglius Turmi Teanebrach, a powerful monarch of\r\nIreland, to Fergus the First, of Scotland, is traced.\r\n\r\nA tradition had indeed prevailed, that the founder, of the house of\r\nMaclean was a son of Fitzgerald, an Earl of Kildare,--a supposition\r\nwhich is contemptuously rejected by the historian of this ancient race.\r\n\"In fact,\" he remarks, \"from various sources, Gillean can be proved to\r\nhave been in his grave, long before such a title as Earl of Kildare was\r\nknown, and nearly two hundred years before the name of Fitzgerald\r\nexisted.\"[71] It appears, indeed, undoubted, from ancient records and\r\nwell-authenticated sources, that the origin of Gillean was derived from\r\nthe source which has been stated.\r\n\r\nWhen the lordship of the Isles was forfeited, the clan Maclean was\r\ndivided into four branches, each of which held of the Lords of the\r\nIsles; these branches were the Macleans of Duart, the Macleans of\r\nLochbuy, the Macleans of Coll, and the Macleans of Ardgour. Of these,\r\nthe most important branch was the family of Duart, founded by Lachlan\r\nMaclean, surnamed Lubanich. This powerful chief obtained such an\r\nascendant at the court of the Lord of the Isles, as to provoke the\r\nenmity of the Chief of Mackinnon, who, on the occasion of a stag-hunt,\r\nformed a plot to cut off Lachlan and his brother, Hector Maclean. But\r\nthe conspiracy was discovered by its objects; Mackinnon suffered death\r\nat the hands of the two brothers for his design; and the Lord of the\r\nIsles, sailing in his galley towards his Castle of Ardtorinsh in Morven,\r\nwas captured, and carried to Icolumb-kill, where he was obliged, sitting\r\non the famous black rock of Iona, held sacred in those days, to swear\r\nthat he would bestow in marriage upon Lachlan Lubanich his daughter\r\nMargaret, granddaughter, by her mother's side, of Robert the Second,\r\nKing of Scotland: and with her, as a dowry, to give to the Lord of\r\nDuart, Eriska, with all its isles. The dowry demanded consisted of a\r\ntowering rock, commanding an extensive view of the islands by which it\r\nis surrounded, and occupying a central situation among those\r\ntributaries.[72] From the bold and aspiring chief was Sir John Maclean\r\nof Duart descended. The marriage of Lachlan Lubanich with Margaret of\r\nthe Isles took place in the year 1366.[73]\r\n\r\nBetween the time of Lachlan Lubanich and the birth of Sir John Maclean,\r\nthe house of Duart encountered various reverses of fortune. It has been\r\nshown how the chief added the rock of Eriska to his possessions; in the\r\ncourse of the following century, a great part of the Isles of Mull and\r\nTirey, with detached lands in Isla, Jura, Scarba, and in the districts\r\nof Morven, Lochaber, and Knapdale, were included in the estates of the\r\nchiefs of Duart, who rose, in the time of James the Sixth, to be among\r\nthe most powerful of the families of the Hebrides. The principal seats\r\nof the chiefs of the Macleans were Duart and Aros Castles in Mull,\r\nCastle Gillean in Kerrara, on the coast of Lorn, and Ardtornish Castle\r\nin Morven. In 1632, on occasion of the visit of one of the chiefs,\r\nLachlan, to the Court of Charles the First, he was created a Baronet of\r\nNova Scotia, by the title of Sir Lachlan Maclean of Morven. But various\r\ncircumstances, and more especially the enmity of the Argyle family, and\r\nthe adherence of Maclean to the Stuarts, had contributed to the decline\r\nof their pre-eminence before the young chief, whose destiny it was to\r\nmake his name known and feared at the court of England, had seen the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe family of Maclean in all its numerous and complicated branches, had\r\nbeen distinguished for loyalty and independence during the intervening\r\ncenturies between the career of Gillean and the birth of that chieftain\r\nwhose devotion to the Jacobite cause proved eventually the ruin of the\r\nhouse of Duart. Throughout the period of the Great Rebellion, and of the\r\nProtectorate, the chief of the Macleans had made immense sacrifices to\r\nsupport the interests of the King, and to bring his clan into the field.\r\nIn the disgraceful transactions, by which it was agreed that Scotland\r\nshould withdraw her troops from England upon the payment of four hundred\r\nthousand pounds, in full of all demands, the faithful Highland clans of\r\nthe north and west, the Grahams, Macleans, Camerons, and many others,\r\nhad no participation. One main actor in that bargain, by which a monarch\r\nwas bought and sold, was the Marquis of Argyle, the enemy and terror of\r\nhis Highland neighbours, the Macleans of Duart. Upon the suppression of\r\nthe royal authority, domestic feuds were ripened into hostilities during\r\nthe general anarchy; and few of the oppressed and harassed clans\r\nsuffered more severely, or more permanently than the Macleans of Duart.\r\n\r\nArchibald, the first Marquis of Argyle, fixed an indelible stain upon\r\nhis memory by acts of unbridled licence and aggression, in relation to\r\nhis Highland neighbours; the unfortunate Macleans of Duart especially\r\nexperienced the effects of his wrath, and suffered from his\r\nmanoeuvres.[74]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Cromwell, Argyle having procured from the Lords of the\r\nTreasury, a grant of the tithes of Argyleshire, with a commission to\r\ncollect several arrears of the feu-duty, cesses, taxation, and supply,\r\nand some new contributions laid on the subject by Parliament, under the\r\nnames of ammunition and contribution money, the power which such an\r\nauthority bestowed, in days when the standard of right was measured by\r\nthe amount of force, may readily be conceived. On the part of Argyle,\r\nlong-cherished views on the territories of his neighbour, Maclean of\r\nDuart, were now brought into co-operation with the most remorseless\r\nabuse of authority.\r\n\r\nSir Lachlan Maclean of Duart, the great-grandfather of Sir John Maclean,\r\nwas then chief of the clan. The Marquis of Argyle directed that\r\napplication should be made to this unfortunate man for his quota of\r\nthese arrears, and also for some small sums for which he had himself\r\nbeen security for the chief. Sir Lachlan was in no condition to comply\r\nwith this demand; for he had suffered more deeply in the royal cause\r\nthan any of his predecessors. During the rule of Argyle and Leslie in\r\nScotland, a rule which might aptly be denominated a reign of terror, the\r\npossessions of the chief in Mull had been ravaged by the parliamentary\r\ntroops, without any resistance from the harmless inhabitants, who had\r\nbeen instructed by their lord to offer no retaliation that could furnish\r\na plea for future oppression. The castle of Duart had been besieged, and\r\nsurrendered to Argyle and Leslie, upon condition that the defenceless\r\ngarrison, and eight Irish gentlemen, inmates of the hospitable\r\nHighlander's home, should be spared. Still more, the infant son of Sir\r\nLachlan had been kidnapped from his school at Dumbarton by Argyle, and\r\nwas paraded by the side of the Marquis to intimidate the chief, who was\r\nmade to understand that any resistance from him would be fatal to his\r\nchild,--\"an instrument,\" observes the seneachie, \"which the coward well\r\nknew might be used with greater effect upon the noble father of his\r\ncaptive, than all the Campbell swords the craven lord could muster.\"\r\nUnder these circumstances, Sir Lachlan Maclean was neither in the temper\r\nnor the condition to comply with the exactions of those whom he also\r\nregarded as having usurped the sovereign authority. He refused; and his\r\nrefusal was exactly what his enemy desired.\r\n\r\nThe next step which Argyle took was to claim the amount due to him from\r\nthe chief, which, by buying up all the debts, public and private, of\r\nMaclean, he swelled to thirty thousand pounds, before a court of law.\r\nSuch was the state of Scottish judicial proceedings in those days, that\r\nthe process was ended before Sir Lachlan had even heard of its\r\ncommencement. He hastened, when informed of it, to Edinburgh, in order\r\nto make known his case before the \"Committee of Estates,\" then acting\r\nwith sovereign authority in Scotland. But he was intercepted at\r\nInverary, cast into prison upon a writ of attachment, issued and signed\r\nby Argyle himself, and immured in Argyle's castle of Carrick, for a debt\r\ndue to Archibald, Marquis of Argyle. It was there required of him that\r\nhe should grant a bond for fourteen thousand pounds Scots, and sign a\r\ndoqueted account for sixteen thousand pounds more, bearing interest.\r\n\r\nFor a time the unhappy chief refused to sign the bond thus demanded; for\r\na year he resisted the oppression of his enemy, and bore his\r\nimprisonment, with the aggravation of declining health. At last his\r\nfriends, alarmed at his sinking condition, entreated him, as the only\r\nmeans of release, to comply with the demand of Argyle. Sir Lachlan\r\nsigned the document, was set free, and returned to Duart, where he\r\nexpired in April, 1649. To his family he bequeathed a legacy of\r\ncontention and misfortune.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Sir Hector Maclean, the young hostage who had been\r\nkidnapped from Dumbarton, was a youth of a warlike and determined\r\nspirit, who resisted the depredations of the plundering clan of\r\nCampbells in Lorn and Ardnamuchan, and, on one occasion, hung up two of\r\nthe invaders at his castle of Dunnin Morvern. Such, in spite of this\r\nsummary mode of proceeding, were Sir Hector's ideas of honour, that,\r\nnotwithstanding his doubts of the validity of the bond obtained from his\r\nfather, he conceived that the superscription of his father's name to it\r\nrendered it his duty to comply with its conditions as he could. He is\r\ndeclared by one authority to have paid ten thousand pounds of the\r\ndemand; by another that fact is doubted, since, when Sir John Maclean's\r\nguardians investigated it, no receipts for sums alleged to have been\r\npaid on account were to be found.[75] But this is again accounted for by\r\nthe seneachie or family historian.\r\n\r\nSir Hector Maclean fell in the battle of Inverkeithing, where, out of\r\neight hundred of his clan who fought against General Lambert, only forty\r\nescaped. He was succeeded by his brother Allan, a child, subject to the\r\nmanagement of guardians. By their good care, a great portion of the debt\r\nto Argyle was paid, but there still remained sufficient to afford the\r\ninsatiable enemy of his house a fair pretext of aggression. The case was\r\nagain brought before the Scottish Council; it was even referred to\r\nCharles the Second; but, by the representations of the Duke of\r\nLauderdale, the Argyle influence prevailed. The famous Marquis of Argyle\r\nwas, indeed, no longer in existence; he had perished on the scaffold:\r\nbut his son still grasped at the possessions of his neighbour; and,\r\nalthough King Charles desired that Lauderdale \"should see that Maclean\r\nhad justice,\" the Duke, who was then Scottish Lord Commissioner, on his\r\nreturn to Scotland, decided that the rents of the estates should be made\r\npayable to Argyle on account of the bond, a certain portion of them\r\nbeing reserved for the maintenance of the chief.\r\n\r\nSir Allan died a little more than a year after this decision had been\r\nmade, ignorant of the decree; and left, to bear the buffeting of the\r\nstorm, his son, Sir John Maclean, a child only four years of age, who\r\nsucceeded his father in 1677.[76] His estates had been placed under the\r\ncare of two of his nearest kinsmen, Lachlan Maclean of Brolas, and\r\nLachlan Maclean of Torloisk, men of profound judgment and of firm\r\ncharacter, from whose guardianship much was expected by the clan. But\r\nthe minor possessed a friend as true as any kinsman could be, and one of\r\nundoubted influence and sagacity, in the celebrated Sir Ewan Cameron of\r\nLochiel. Against his interest, in despite of Argyle, that brave and\r\nnoble man espoused the cause of the weak and of the fatherless,\r\nnotwithstanding that he was himself a debtor to Argyle, of whose power\r\nand will to injure he had shortly a proof. Finding that Lochiel was\r\nresolved to protect and assist the young Maclean, the Earl of Argyle[77]\r\nsent to demand from Sir Ewan the payment of the debt he owed, assuring\r\nhim that it was his intention to follow out the law with the greatest\r\nrigour. Sir Ewan answered that he had not the money to pay, neither\r\nwould he act against his friends. This threat, however, obliged Sir Ewan\r\nto continue in arms, contrary to proclamation, and also to obtain a\r\nprotection from the Privy Council in Edinburgh, against the vengeance of\r\nArgyle.\r\n\r\nBut that which occasioned the greatest vexation to Sir Ewan, was an\r\nopportunity which he conceived that the tutors or guardians of the young\r\nMaclean had lost the power of emancipating their ward from the clutches\r\nof Argyle's power. This, he thought, might have been effected upon the\r\nforfeiture of the Marquis of Argyle to the Crown, when he considered\r\nthat an opportunity might have been afforded to Maclean's guardians to\r\nrelease their ward from Argyle's hands, by a transaction with certain\r\ncreditors of that nobleman, to whom the sum claimed by Argyle from\r\nMaclean had been promised, but never paid. Thus, by an unaccountable\r\noversight, the power of the Argyle family over the fortunes of the\r\nMacleans was continued.\r\n\r\nUnder these adverse circumstances, Sir John Maclean succeeded to his\r\ninheritance. His principal guardian, although bearing a high reputation\r\namong the clan, was esteemed by Sir Ewan as \"a person who seems to have\r\nbeen absolutely unfitt for manageing his affairs att such a\r\njuncture;\"[78] and soon proved to be far too easy and credulous to\r\ncontest with the crafty Campbells. Full of compassion for the helpless\r\ninfant chief, Sir Ewan now resolved never to abandon the Macleans until\r\nmatters were adjusted between them. He passed the winter of the year in\r\nEdinburgh, where he was, at one time, so much incensed against the Earl\r\nof Argyle for his cruelty to the Macleans, and so indignant at his\r\nconduct to himself, that the valiant chief of the Camerons was with\r\ndifficulty restrained by his servant from shooting Argyle as he stepped\r\ninto his coach to attend the council.[79]\r\n\r\nWhilst the counsels of Sir Ewan Cameron prevailed with the guardians,\r\nthe Macleans remained merely on the defensive; but when the insinuations\r\nof Lord Macdonald, who had much influence with one of the young heir's\r\nguardians, were listened to, the Macleans were incited to reprisals and\r\nplunder, to which it was at all times no difficult matter to stimulate\r\nHighlanders.\r\n\r\nAt length the powerful and mortal foe succeeded to his heart's content\r\nin his scheme of oppression. Argyle, in his capacity of Hereditary\r\nJusticiary of the Isles, summoned the clan Maclean to appear and stand\r\ntheir trials for treasonable convocations, garrisoning their houses and\r\ncastles, &c.; the unfortunate clansmen, knowing their enemy to be both\r\njudge and evidence, did not obey. Immediately they were declared rebels\r\nand outlaws, and a commission of fire and sword was issued against them.\r\nAll communication between them and the Privy Council, who might have\r\nredressed their wrongs, was cut off: those who happened to fall into the\r\nhands of the Campbells, were cruelly treated; and those who styled\r\nthemselves Maclean were blockaded in the Islands, and almost starved for\r\nwant of provisions. Reduced in strength by the battle of Inverkeithing,\r\nthe clan was but ill-prepared to resist so formidable a foe as Argyle,\r\nwhose men, therefore, landed without opposition, the people flying to\r\ntheir mountains as the enemy approached. The young chief was sent, for\r\nprotection, first to the fortified island of Thernburg, and afterwards\r\nto Kintail, under the care of the Earl of Seaforth, who had, not long\r\npreviously, acted as a sort of arbitrator in the affairs of the\r\nfamily.[80]\r\n\r\nWhile Sir John Maclean was thus, probably, unconscious of his wrongs and\r\ndangers, secured from personal injury, the strong old Castle of Duart\r\nwas taken possession of by Argyle, who, finding it garrisoned, was\r\nobliged to publish an indemnity, which he had obtained on purpose,\r\nremitting all crimes committed by the Macleans since the eighteenth of\r\nSeptember, 1674, on condition that the castle should be delivered to\r\nhim,--a demand with which the islanders were forced to comply. But in\r\nvain did Argyle endeavour to prevail upon the honest and simple clansmen\r\nto renounce their allegiance to their chief, and to become his\r\nvassals.[81] Every species of indignity and of plunder was inflicted\r\nupon these hapless, but faithful Highlanders in vain; a \"monster,\" as he\r\nis termed, \"bearing the stamp of human appearance, named Sir Neill\r\nCampbell,\" in vain chased the poor inhabitants to the hills, and there\r\nexhibited acts of cruelty too shocking to be related. A promise,\r\nhowever, of payment of rents was at last obtained by Argyle, and he left\r\nthe island, after garrisoning the castles. But this tribute was never\r\npaid. The Macleans could neither bear to see the halls of Duart and of\r\nAros Castle tenanted by their foes, nor would they submit to pay to them\r\ntheir rents. A league of defence was again formed; letters of fire and\r\nsword were, in consequence, issued; but Argyle was baffled by a\r\nhurricane in his second invasion of Duart. Nature conspired with the\r\ninjured in their protection; and, after some time, the guardians of Sir\r\nJohn Maclean, accompanied by Lord Macdonald, proceeded to London in\r\norder to appeal to the Privy Council. The appeal thus made was prolonged\r\nuntil the year 1680, when it was at last settled by the Scottish\r\nCouncil; and the island of Tyrie was given to the Earl of Argyle, in\r\nfull payment of his claim upon the estates of Sir John Maclean.\r\n\r\nThe character of the young chief was, meantime, formed under the\r\ninfluence of these events, of which, when he grew up, whilst yet the\r\nstorm raged, he could not be ignorant. One principle he inherited from\r\nhis ancestors--a determined fidelity to the Stuart cause. When he was\r\nfifteen years of age, the death of his guardians threw the management of\r\nhis affairs into his own hands; this was in the years 1686 and 1687, one\r\nof the most critical periods in English history. Having appointed\r\ncertain gentlemen his agents, or factors, the young chief went,\r\naccording to the fashion of his times, to travel. He first repaired to\r\nthe Court of England, at that time under the sway of James the Second;\r\nhe then crossed to France, and returned not to the British dominions\r\nuntil he accompanied James into Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe character of Sir John Maclean, as he attained manhood, and entered\r\ninto the active business of life, has been drawn with great felicity by\r\nthe author of \"The Memoirs of Lochiel.\"[82]\r\n\r\n\"He was,\" says this writer, \"of a person and disposition more turned\r\nfor the court and the camp, than for the business of a private life.\r\nThere was a natural vivacity and politeness in his manner, which he\r\nafterwards much improved by a courtly education; and, as his person was\r\nwell-made and gracefull, so he took care to sett it off by all the\r\nornaments and luxury of dress. He was of a sweet temper, and\r\ngood-natured. His witt lively and sparkeling, and his humour pleasant\r\nand facetious. He loved books, and acquired the languages with great\r\nfacility, whereby he cultivated and enriched his understanding with all\r\nmanner of learning, but especially the belles lettres; add to this, a\r\nnatural elegancy of expression, and ane inexhaustible fancy, which, on\r\nall occasions, furnished him with such a copious variety of matter, as\r\nrendered his conversation allways new and entertaining. But with all\r\nthese shining qualitys, the natural indolence of his temper, and ane\r\nimmoderate love of pleasure, made him unsuiteable to the circumstances\r\nof his family. No persons talked of affairs, private or publick, with a\r\nbetter grace, or more to the purpose, but he could not prevail with\r\nhimself to be att the least trouble in the execution. He seemed to know\r\neverything, and from the smallest hint so penetrated into the\r\ncircumstances of other people's buisiness, that he often did great\r\nservices by his excellent advice; and he was of a temper so kind and\r\nobligeing, that he was fond of every occasion or doeing good to his\r\nfriends, while he neglected many inviteing opportunities of serveing\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nThe first hostilities between France and England, after the Revolution,\r\nbroke out in Ireland, whence it was the design of James the Second to\r\nincite his English and Scottish subjects to his cause. And there was,\r\napparently, ample grounds for hope; England was rent with factions, Lord\r\nDundee was raising a civil war in Scotland, and half Europe was in\r\ncontention with the other, whether the late King of England should be\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\n\"I will recover my own dominions with my own subjects,\" was the boast of\r\nJames, \"or perish in the attempt.\" Unhappily, like his son, his\r\nmagnanimity ended in expressions.\r\n\r\nSir John Maclean accompanied James when he landed, on the twelfth of\r\nMarch, 1689, in Ireland; after the siege of Derry, the chief returned to\r\nScotland, accompanied by Sir Alexander Maclean of Otter, and there very\r\nsoon showed his determination in favour of the insurrection raised by\r\nDundee.\r\n\r\nSir John Maclean's first step was to send Maclean of Lochbuy as his\r\nlieutenant with three hundred men to join Dundee. His party encountered\r\na major of General Mackay's army at Knockbreak in Badenoch; a conflict\r\nensued, and Mackay's men were put to flight. This was the first blood\r\nthat was shed for James the Second in Scotland.\r\n\r\nSir John Maclean soon afterwards joined Dundee in person, leaving his\r\ncastle of Duart well defended. This fort, which had witnessed so many\r\ninvasions, was besieged during the absence of the chief by Sir George\r\nRooke, who cannonaded it several days without effect. Its owner,\r\nmeantime, had joined Dundee, and was appointed to the command of the\r\nright wing of the army.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Killicrankie, Sir John Maclean distinguished himself,\r\nas became the descendant of a brave and loyal race, at the head of his\r\nclan; he probably witnessed the death of Dundee. Few events in Scottish\r\nhistory could have affected those who followed a General to the field so\r\nseverely. Lord Dundee had been foremost on foot during the action; he\r\nwas foremost on horseback, when the enemy retreated, in the pursuit. He\r\npressed on to the mouth of the Pass of Killicrankie to cut off the\r\nescape. In a short time he perceived that he had overrun his men: he\r\nstopped short: he waved his arm in the air to make them hasten their\r\nspeed. Conspicuous in his person he was observed; a musket-ball was\r\naimed at that extended arm; it struck him, and found entrance through an\r\nopening in his armour. The brave General was wounded in the arm-pit. He\r\nrode off the field, desiring that the mischance might not be disclosed,\r\nand fainting, dropped from his horse. As soon as he was revived, he\r\ndesired to be raised, and looking towards the field of battle asked how\r\nthings went. \"Well,\" was the reply. \"Then,\" he said, \"I am well,\" and\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nWilliam the Third understood the merits of his brave opponent. An\r\nexpress was sent to Edinburgh with an account of the action. \"Dundee,\"\r\nsaid the King (and the _soldier_ spoke), \"must be dead, or he would\r\nhave been at Edinburgh before the express.\" When urged to send troops to\r\nScotland, \"It is needless,\" he answered; \"the war ended with Dundee's\r\nlife.\" And the observation was just: a peace was soon afterwards\r\nconcluded.[83]\r\n\r\nSir John Maclean, nevertheless, continued in arms under the command of\r\nColonel Cannon, and lost several brave officers by the incapacity of\r\nthis commander. After the peace was signed, he returned to live upon his\r\nestates, until Argyle, having procured a commission from William to\r\nreduce the Macleans by fire or sword, invaded the island of Mull with\r\ntwo thousand five hundred men. Sir John being unprepared to resist him,\r\nafter advising his vassals to accept protection from Argyle, again\r\nretired to the island of Thernburg, whence he captured several of King\r\nWilliam's vessels which were going to supply the army in Ireland.[84]\r\n\r\nThe massacre of Glencoe operated in some respects favourably, after the\r\ntragedy had been completed, upon the circumstances of the Jacobites.\r\nTerrified at the odium incurred, a more lenient spirit was henceforth\r\nshown to them by Government. Many persons were exempted from taking the\r\noaths, and were allowed to remain in their houses. Early in the year\r\n1792, Sir John Maclean took advantage of this favourable turn of\r\naffairs, and, after obtaining permission through the influence of\r\nArgyle, and placing the castle of Duart under that nobleman's control,\r\nhe went to England.\r\n\r\nHe soon became a favourite at the Court of one who, if we except the\r\nmassacre of Glencoe, evinced few dispositions of cruelty to the Scottish\r\nJacobites. King William is said, nevertheless, to have had a real\r\nantipathy to the Highlanders; and Queen Mary, whose heart turned to the\r\nadherents of her forefathers, was obliged to conceal her partiality for\r\nher Northern subjects. It had appeared, however, on several occasions,\r\nduring the absence of her consort, and was now evinced in her good\r\noffices to the chief of the clan Maclean. That the chief was of a\r\ndeportment to confirm the kind sentiments thus shown towards him, the\r\ncharacter which has been given of him amply proves.\r\n\r\nSir John Maclean was, as the author of Sir Ewan Cameron's life relates,\r\n\"the only person of his party that went to Court, which no doubt\r\ncontributed much to his being so particularly observed by the Queen, who\r\nreceived him most graciously, honoured him frequently with her\r\nconversation, and said many kind and obliging things to him. Sir John on\r\nhis part acquitted himself with so much politeness and address, that her\r\nMajesty soon began to esteem him. He took the proper occasions to inform\r\nher of the misfortunes of his family, and artfully insinuated that he\r\nand his predecessors had drawn them all upon themselves by the services\r\nthey had rendered to her grandfather, father, and uncle. She answered,\r\nthat the antiquity and merit of his family were no strangers to her\r\nears; and that, though she had taken a resolution never to interpose\r\nbetwixt her father's friends and the King her husband, yet, she would\r\ndistinguish him so far as to recommend his services to his Majesty by a\r\nletter under her own hand; and that she doubted not but that it would\r\nhave some influence, since it was the first favour of that nature which\r\nshe had ever demanded.\"\r\n\r\nSir John is, however, declared by another authority to have declined the\r\ncommission thus offered to him. Although he had received King James's\r\npermission to reconcile himself with the Government, he did not, it\r\nappears, choose to bear arms in its defence. Such is the statement of\r\none historian.[86] By another it is said that \"Sir John was much\r\ncaressed while he continued in the army,\"[87]--a sentence which\r\ncertainly seems to imply that he had assented to King William's offer.\r\nAt all events, he managed to engage the confidence of the King so far,\r\nthat William \"not only honoured him with his countenance, but told\r\nArgyle that he must part with Sir John's estate, and that he himself\r\nwould be the purchaser.\"\r\n\r\nThe nobleman to whom William addressed this injunction was of a very\r\ndifferent temper from his father and grandfather, who had both died on\r\nthe scaffold. Archibald, afterwards created by William Duke of Argyle,\r\nhad in 1685 become the head of that powerful family; he was of a frank,\r\nnoble, and generous disposition. \"He loved,\" says the same writer, \"his\r\npleasures, affected magnificence, and valued money no further than as\r\nit contributed to support the expence which the gallantry of his temper\r\ndaily put him to. He several times offered very easy terms to Sir John;\r\nand particularly he made one overture of quitting all his pretentions to\r\nthat estate, on condition of submitting to be the Earl's vassall for the\r\ngreatest part of it, and paying him two thousand pounds sterling, which\r\nhe had then by him in ready money; but the expensive gayety of Sir\r\nJohn's temper made him unwilling to part with the money, and the name of\r\na vassall suited as ill with his vanity, which occasioned that and\r\nseveral other proposals to be refused. However, as the generous Earl was\r\nnoways uneasy to part with the estate, so he, with his usewall\r\nfrankness, answered King William that his Majesty might always command\r\nhim and his fortunes; and that he submitted his claim upon Sir John's\r\nestate, as he did everything else, to his royal pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nA tradition exists in the family, that when Argyle sent messengers with\r\nhis proposals to the Castle of Duart, Sir John pushed away the boat, as\r\nit neared the shore, with his own hands. This was worthy the pride of a\r\nHighland chieftain.\r\n\r\nTo such a height, in short, did William's favour amount, and so far did\r\nhe in this instance carry his usual policy of conciliating his enemies\r\nby courtesy and aid, that he ordered Maclean to go as a volunteer in his\r\nservice, assuring him that he would see that no harm was done to his\r\nproperty in his absence. Sir John, previous to his intended departure\r\nfrom England, went to Scotland to put his affairs in order. On his\r\nreturn he was told by Queen Mary that there were reports to his\r\nprejudice; he denied them, and satisfied the Queen that all suspicions\r\nof his fidelity were unfounded. Upon the strength of this assurance the\r\nQueen wrote in Maclean's favour to the King, in Holland, whither Sir\r\nJohn then proceeded to join his Majesty. But this profession of fidelity\r\nto one monarch soon proved to be hollow. Maclean was truly one of the\r\npoliticians of the day, swayed by every turn of fortune, and cherishing\r\na deep regard for his own interest in his heart. To inspire dislike and\r\ndistrust wherever he desired to secure allegiance was the lot of\r\nWilliam, of whom it has been bitterly said, that in return for having\r\ndelivered three kingdoms from popery and slavery, he was, before having\r\nbeen a year on the throne, repaid \"with faction in one of them, with\r\nrebellion in the other, and with both in the third.\" How expressive was\r\nthe exclamation wrung from him, \"that he wished he had never been King\r\nof Scotland.\" Sir John Maclean was one of those who added another proof\r\nto the King's conviction, \"that the flame of party once raised, it was\r\nin vain to expect that truth, justice, or public interest could\r\nextinguish it.\"[88]\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Bruges, Maclean heard of the battle of Landau, in which\r\nthe French army had proved victorious against the Confederates; and at\r\nthe same time a report prevailed that a counter revolution had taken\r\nplace in England, and that William was already dethroned. Sir John\r\nchanged his course upon this intelligence, and hastened to St. Germains,\r\nwhere he was, as might be expected, coldly received. He remained there\r\nuntil the death of William, and then he married the daughter of Sir\r\nEnaeas Macpherson of Skye.\r\n\r\nUpon the accession of Anne, Sir John took advantage of the general\r\nindemnity offered to those who had gone abroad with James the Second,\r\nand resolved to avail himself of this opportunity of returning home;\r\nbut, unluckily, he was detained until a day after the act had specified,\r\nby the confinement of his wife, who was taken ill at Paris, and there,\r\nin November 1703, gave birth to a son, who afterwards succeeded to the\r\nbaronetcy. Although there was some risk in proceeding, yet Sir John,\r\ntrusting to the Queen's favourable disposition to the Jacobites,\r\nembarked, and with his wife and child reached London. There he was\r\nimmediately committed to the Tower, but his imprisonment had a deeper\r\nsource than the mere delay of a few weeks. The Queensbury plot at that\r\ntime agitated the public, and produced considerable embarrassment in the\r\ncounsels of state.[89]\r\n\r\nIt appears that Sir John Maclean had taken no part in this obscure\r\ntransaction which could affect his honour, or impair his chance of\r\nfavour from Queen Anne; for, so soon as he was liberated, she bestowed\r\nupon him a pension of five hundred pounds a-year, which he enjoyed\r\nduring the remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nFor some years Sir John Maclean continued to divide his time between\r\nLondon and the Highlands, where he frequently visited his firm friend\r\nSir Ewan Cameron of Lochiel, at his Castle of Achnacarry. His estates\r\nhad not been materially benefited by the brief sunshine of King\r\nWilliam's favour. Upon finding that Maclean had gone to St. Germains,\r\nthat monarch had confirmed to the Duke of Argyle the former grant of the\r\nisland of Tyrie, which the successors of the Duke have since\r\nuninterruptedly enjoyed until the present day. Its value was, at the\r\ntime of its passing into the hands of the Campbells, about three hundred\r\npounds sterling per annum.[90] The chief of the clan Maclean was certain\r\nnever to escape the suspicions of the Government, after the death of\r\nAnne, during whose reign the Highlanders experienced an unwonted degree\r\nof tranquillity. Upon her demise the whole state of affairs was changed;\r\nand none experienced greater inconveniences from the vigilance of\r\nGovernment than Sir Ewan Cameron and his friend Maclean. Lochiel, as his\r\nbiographer observes, \"drank deeply of this bitter cup.\"[91]\r\n\r\nIt was during one of Maclean's visits to Achnacarry, when in company\r\nwith his now venerable friend, that the Governor of Fort William\r\nattempted to take him and Sir Ewan prisoners, but they made their\r\nescape. During the night of their flight, however, Sir Maclean caught a\r\nsevere cold, which ended afterwards fatally.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Mar raised the standard of the Chevalier in Scotland,\r\nSir John joined him at Achterarder, some days before the battle of\r\nSherriff Muir. In that engagement the clan Maclean distinguished\r\nthemselves, and some of their brave chieftains were killed in the\r\nbattle. After the day was over, Sir John retired to Keith, where he\r\nparted from his followers, never to rejoin them. A consumption, incurred\r\nfrom the cold caught in his escape, was then far advanced. He declined\r\nan offer made to receive him on board the Chevalier's ship, bound for\r\nFrance, and went to Gordon Castle, where, on the twelfth of March, 1716,\r\nhe expired.\r\n\r\nThus ended a life characterized by no ordinary share of vicissitude and\r\nmisfortune. If the fate of Sir John Maclean be less tragical than that\r\nof other distinguished Jacobites, it was, it must be acknowledged, one\r\nreplete with anxiety and disappointment. He may be said to have been\r\npeculiarly \"born to trouble.\" To our modern notions of honour and\r\nconsistency, his conduct in becoming a courtier of William the Third,\r\nappears to betray that unsoundness and hollowness of political principle\r\nwhich, more or less, was the prevalent moral disease of the period, and\r\nwhich was attributable to some of the most celebrated men of the day. It\r\nundoubtedly forms an unfavourable contrast to the stern independence of\r\nSir Ewan Cameron of Lochiel, and of other Highland chieftains, and too\r\ngreatly resembles the code of politics adopted by the Earl of Mar. But\r\nthose who knew Sir John Maclean intimately, considered him a man of\r\nstraightforward integrity; they deemed him above dissimulation, and have\r\nplaced his name among those who despised every worldly advantage for the\r\nsake of principle, and who loved the cause which he had espoused for its\r\nown sake. The broken towers of Duart and of Aros, the ruins of those\r\nonce proud lords of the soil, attest the sacrifices which they made, and\r\nform a melancholy commentary upon their history.\r\n\r\nThe castle of Aros, in the Island of Mull, \"is interesting,\" says\r\nMacculloch,[92] \"from the picturesque object which it affords to the\r\nartist; the more so, as the country is so devoid of scenes on which his\r\npencil can be exerted. Still more striking, from its greater magnitude\r\nand more elevated position, is Duart Castle, once the stronghold of the\r\nMacleans, and till lately garrisoned by a detachment from Fort William.\r\nIt is fast falling into ruin since it was abandoned as a barrack. When a\r\nfew years shall have passed, the almost roofless tenant will surrender\r\nhis spacious apartments to the bat and the owl, and seek shelter, like\r\nhis neighbours, in the thatched hovel which rises near him. But the\r\nwalls, of formidable thickness, may long bid defiance even to the storms\r\nof this region; remaining to mark to future times the barbarous\r\nsplendour of the ancient Highland chieftains, and, with the opposite\r\nfortress of Ardtornish, serving to throw a gleam of historical interest\r\nover the passage of the Sound of Mull.\"\r\n\r\nHitherto Iona had received the last remains of the Lords of Duart; but\r\nSir John Maclean was not carried to the resting-place of his\r\nforefathers. He was buried in the church of Raffin in Bamffshire, in the\r\nfamily vault of the Gordons of Buckie. In Iona, that former \"light of\r\nthe western world,\" are the tombs of the brave and unfortunate Macleans.\r\nTheir bones are interred in the vaults of the cathedral, which, after\r\ncoasting the barren rocks of Mull, buffeted by the waves, the traveller\r\nbeholds rising out of the sea, \"giving,\" as it is finely expressed, \"to\r\nthis desolate region an air of civilization, and recalling the\r\nconsciousness of that human society which, presenting elsewhere no\r\nvisible traces, seems to have abandoned these rocky shores to the\r\ncormorant and the gull.\" On the tombs of the Highland warriors who\r\nrepose within St. Mary's Church in Iona, are sculptured ships, swords,\r\narmorial bearings, appropriate memorials to the island lords, or, as the\r\nChevalier not inaptly called them, \"little kings;\" and,\r\nundistinguishable from the graves of the chiefs, are the funereal\r\nallotments of the Kings of Scotland, Iceland, and Norway.[93]\r\n\r\nSir John Maclean left one son and six daughters. His son Hector was born\r\nin France, but brought to Scotland at the age of four, and placed under\r\nthe care of his kinsman, Maclean of Coll, where he remained until he was\r\neighteen years of age; when he repaired to Edinburgh, and in the college\r\nmade considerable progress in the usual course of studies in that\r\ninstitution. After various journeys abroad, chiefly to Paris, Sir Hector\r\nMaclean returned in 1745 to Edinburgh, intending again to lead his\r\nclansmen to the standard of Prince Charles; but a temporary\r\nimprisonment, occasioned by the treachery of a man in whose house he\r\nlodged, prevented his appearance in the field. He was detained in\r\nconfinement until released as a subject of the King of France. He died\r\nat Rome in the year 1758, in the forty-seventh year of his age. At his\r\ndeath the title of Baronet devolved upon Allan of Brolas, great-grandson\r\nof Donald, first Maclean of Brolas, and younger brother of the first\r\nbaronet.\r\n\r\nAlthough the chief was thus prevented from following Prince Charles to\r\nthe field of Culloden, many of his clan distinguished themselves there;\r\nCharles Maclean of Drimnin appeared at the head of five hundred of the\r\nclan, and his regiment, which was under the command of the Duke of\r\nPerth, was among those that broke forward with drawn swords from the\r\nlines, and routed the left wing of the Duke of Cumberland's army. The\r\nwhole of the front line of this gallant regiment was swept away as they\r\npresented themselves before their foes. They were afterwards overpowered\r\nby numbers, and obliged to retire. Their leader, as he retreated,\r\ninquired for one of his sons, who was missing. \"I fear,\" said an\r\nattendant to whom the inquiry was addressed, \"that he has fallen.\" The\r\nfate of the father is well told in these few words,[94] \"If he has, it\r\nshall not be for naught,\" was his reply; and he rushed forward to avenge\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMany of the clan fell in the massacre after the battle of Culloden Muir.\r\nHundreds of the Highlanders who escaped the inhumanity of their\r\nconquerors, died of their wounds or of hunger, in the hills, at twelve\r\nor fourteen miles' distance from the field of battle. \"Their misery,\"\r\nsays a contemporary writer, \"was inexpressible.\" While the cannon was\r\nsounding, and bells were pealing in the capital cities of England and\r\nIreland, for the united events of the Duke of Cumberland's birth and the\r\nbattle of Culloden Moor, fires were seen blazing in Morvern, in which\r\nnumerous villages were burned by order of the victorious Cumberland. The\r\nMacleans who came from Mull, seem generally to have escaped; they made\r\noff in one of the long boats for their island, the night after the\r\nengagement, and were fortunate enough to carry with them a cargo of\r\nbrandy and some money.[95]\r\n\r\nA calmer, though less interesting career has, since 1745, been the fate\r\nof the chiefs of the clan Maclean.[96] Sir Allan, respected and\r\nbeloved, became a colonel in the British army. He retired eventually to\r\nthe sacred Isle of Inch Kenneth, in Mull, where he exercised the\r\nhospitality characteristic, in ancient times, of the Lords of Duart. Dr.\r\nJohnson has handed down the memory of the venerable chief, not only in a\r\nfew descriptive pages of a Tour to the Hebrides, but in a Latin poem,\r\ntranslated by Sir Daniel Sandford.[97] In the lines he refers to Sir\r\nAllan in these terms.\r\n\r\n    \"O'er glassy tides I thither flew,\r\n    The wonders of the spot to view;\r\n    In lowly cottage great Maclean\r\n    Held there his high ancestral reign.\"[98]\r\n\r\nSir Allan Maclean died in 1783: he was succeeded by his nearest male\r\nrelation, Sir Hector Maclean, of the family of Brolas. The brother of\r\nSir Hector, Sir Fitzroy Grafton Maclean, a distinguished officer, and\r\nformerly Governor of the island of St. Thomas, is now chief of the clan\r\nMaclean. Two sons continue the line. Of these, the eldest, Colonel\r\nCharles Fitzroy Maclean, has chosen, like his father, the profession of\r\narms. He commands the eighty-first foot: and has, by his marriage with\r\na daughter of the Hon. and Rev. Dr. Marsham, an heir to the ancestral\r\nhonours of the house. The youngest son of Sir Fitzroy Maclean is Donald\r\nMaclean, of Witton Castle, Durham, the member for Oxford, married to\r\nHarriet, daughter of General Frederick Maitland, a descendant of the\r\nDuke of Lauderdale, whose former injustice to the clan Maclean has been\r\nnoticed in this work. It is remarkable, that the same fidelity, the same\r\nloyalty, that sacrificed every possession to the cause of James Stuart,\r\nhas been, since the extinction of that cause, worthily employed, with\r\ndistinguished talent and success, in the service of Government. Such\r\ninstances are not uncommon in the history of the Jacobites.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[69] Historical and Genealogical Account of the Clan Maclean, by a\r\nSeneachie.\r\n\r\n[70] Brown's Highlands.\r\n\r\n[71] Historical Account of the Clan Maclean, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[72] \"Eriska is interesting as having been the first place where Charles\r\nEdward landed in Scotland.

Aberdeen,\r\n1745.\r\n\r\n[96] An accomplished descendant of the Macleans of Lochbuy, Miss Moss,\r\nof Edinburgh, has left a beautiful tribute to the valour of her clan in\r\na ballad of the forty-five. The following passage occurs in Dr. Brown's\r\nHistory of the Highlands, vol. iv. part II. p. 493, relative to the\r\nMacleans of Lochbuy, Coll, and Ardgour:--\"Their estates being afterwards\r\nrestored, they listened to the persuasions of Professor Forbes, and\r\nremained quiet until the subsequent insurrection of 1745, when a general\r\nrising of the clans would most probably have placed the crown upon the\r\nhead of the descendant of their ancient line of kings.\" This reproach\r\nrests only on the three houses just mentioned, and not on the Macleans\r\nof Brolas, nor of Mull, who were at the battle of Culloden.\r\n\r\nFor a portion of the materials of the foregoing narrative I am greatly\r\nindebted to the Historical and Genealogical Account of the Clan Maclean,\r\nby a Seneachie. The work is compiled chiefly from the Duart Manuscripts.\r\n\r\n[97] Hist. Notices, p. 209.\r\n\r\n[98] See History of Iona by Lachlan Maclean, Esq., Glasgow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROB ROY MACGREGOR CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Clan Gregiour,\" according to an anonymous writer of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, \"is a race of men so utterly infamous for thieving,\r\ndepredation, and murder, that after many Acts of the Council of Scotland\r\nagainst them, at length in the reign of King Charles the First, the\r\nParliament made a strict Act suppressing the very name.\" Upon the\r\nRestoration, when, as the same writer declares, \"the reins were given to\r\nall licentiousness, and loyalty, as it was called, was thought\r\nsufficient to compound for all wickedness, the Act was rescinded. But,\r\nupon the late happy Revolution, when the nation began to recover her\r\nsenses, some horrid barbarities having been committed by that execrable\r\ncrew, under the leading of one Robert Roy Macgregiour, yet living, the\r\nParliament under King William and Queen Mary annulled the said Act\r\nrescissory, and revived the former penal statute against them.\"[99]\r\n\r\nSuch is the summary account of one who is evidently adverse to the\r\npolitical creed, no less than to the daring violence, of the clan\r\nMacgregor. Little can, it is true, be offered in palliation for the\r\nextraordinary career of spoliation and outrage which the history of\r\nthis race of Highlanders presents; and which terminated only with the\r\nexistence of the clan itself.\r\n\r\nThe clan Gregor, anciently known by the name of clan Albin, dated their\r\norigin from the ninth century, and assumed to be the descendants of King\r\nAlpin, who flourished in the year 787: so great is its antiquity, that\r\nan old chronicle asserts, speaking of the clan Macarthur, \"that none are\r\nolder than that clan, except the hills, the rivers, and the clan Albin.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the conflicts which for centuries rendered the Highlands the\r\ntheatre of perpetual strife, the clan Albin, or, as in process of time\r\nit was called, the clan Gregor, was marked as the most turbulent members\r\nof the state. It was never safe to dispute with them, and was deemed\r\nidle to inquire whether the lands which they occupied were theirs by\r\nlegal titles, or by the right of the sword. Situate on the confines of\r\nScotland, and protected by the inaccessible mountains which surrounded\r\nthem, they could defy even their most powerful neighbours, who were\r\nalways desirous of conciliating allies so dangerous in times of peace,\r\nso prompt in war. The boundaries which they occupied stretched along the\r\nwilds of the Trosaehs and Balquhidder, to the northern and western\r\nheights of Mannach and Glenurely, comprehending portions of the counties\r\nof Argyle, Perth, Dumbarton, and Stirling, which regions obtained the\r\nname of the country of the Mac Gregors. A part of these domains being\r\nheld by the _coir a glaive_, or right of the sword, exposed the clan\r\nGregor to the enmity of their formidable neighbours, the Earls of Argyle\r\nand Breadalbane, who, obtaining royal grants of such lands, lost no\r\nopportunity of annoying and despoiling their neighbours, under legal\r\npretexts. Hence many of the contests which procured for the Macgregors a\r\ncharacter of ferocity, and brought upon them 'letters of fire and\r\nsword.' A commission was granted first in the reign of Queen Mary, in\r\n1563, to the most powerful clansmen and nobles, to pursue, and\r\nexterminate the clan Gregor, and prohibiting, at the same time, that her\r\nMajesty's liege subjects should receive or assist any of the clan, or\r\ngive them meat, drink, or clothes. The effect which such an edict was\r\nlikely to produce upon a bold, determined, desperate people may readily\r\nbe conceived. Hitherto the clan Gregor had been a loyal clan. From the\r\nhouse of Alpin had descended the royal family of Stewart, with whom the\r\nMacgregors claimed kindred, bearing upon their shields, in Gaelic, the\r\nwords, 'My tribe is royal.' They had been also in favour with the early\r\nScottish monarchs, one of whom had ennobled the Macgregors of Glenurely,\r\nwho could cope with the most elevated families in Scotland, in\r\npossessions and importance. But, after the edict of Mary, a palpable\r\ndecline in the fortunes of the clan Gregor was manifest, until it was\r\nfor ever extinguished in modern days. Henceforth the Macgregors\r\nexhibited a contempt for those laws which had never afforded them\r\nprotection. They became, in consequence of the cruel proclamation\r\nagainst them, dependent for subsistence upon their system of predatory\r\nwarfare. They grew accustomed to bloodshed, and could easily be\r\n'_hounded out_,' as Sir Walter Scott expresses it, to commit deeds of\r\nviolence. Hence they were incessantly engaged in desperate feuds, in\r\nwhich the vengeance of an injured and persecuted people was poured out\r\nmercilessly upon the defenceless. Hence they became objects of hatred to\r\nthe community, until the famous contest of Glenfruin, between the\r\nMacgregors and the Colquhouns of Luss, brought once more the royal\r\ndispleasure upon them in the reign of James the Sixth.\r\n\r\nThe sequestered valley, which obtained, from the memorable and tragical\r\nevents of the combat, the name of the Glen of Sorrow, is situated about\r\nsix miles from Loch Lomond, and is watered by the river Fruin which\r\nempties itself into that lake. In the spring of the year 1603, Alexander\r\nof Glenstrae, chief of the Macgregors, went from the country of Lennox\r\nto Balquhidder, for the express purpose of conciliating the feuds which\r\nsubsisted between his brother and Sir Humphrey Colquhoun of Luss. After\r\na conference, apparently pacific, but well understood by the Macgregors\r\nto augur no friendly intentions, the assembled members of that clan\r\nprepared to return to their homes. They were followed by the Laird of\r\nLuss, who was resolved to surprise them on their route. But his\r\ntreachery was secretly known by those whom he pursued.\r\n\r\nThe right bank of Loch Lomond is so steep and woody that before the\r\nformation of roads, the Highlanders found it impossible to pass that\r\nway. The way to Argyleshire, therefore, ran along the vale of Fruin in a\r\ncircuitous direction to the head of Loch Long, and again turned eastward\r\ntowards Loch Lomond. In the middle of the glen the Macgregors, who were\r\npeacefully returning home, were attacked by the Colquhouns. The\r\nassailants were four to one; but the valour of the Macgregors prevailed,\r\nand two hundred Colquhouns were left dead on the field. The very name of\r\nColquhoun was nearly annihilated. The account of the battle was\r\ntransmitted by the Laird of Luss to James the Sixth, at Edinburgh; and\r\nthe message was accompanied by two hundred and twenty shirts, stained\r\nwith blood, which were presented to the King by sixty women, widows of\r\nthose slain in the Glen of Sorrow. These ladies rode on white poneys,\r\nand carried in their hands long poles, on which were extended the\r\nstained garments. But the shirts, it is said, were soiled by the way,\r\nand the widows were hireling mourners, who comforted themselves with the\r\nloved beverages of their country on their return, and were in many\r\ninstances obliged to be carried to their homes.[100]\r\n\r\nThe indignation of James the Sixth, unmitigated by any friendly\r\nrepresentations on behalf of the Macgregors, burst forth fatally for\r\nthe clan. The Macgregors were formally outlawed by Act of Parliament;\r\nthey were pursued with blood-hounds, and when seized, were put to death\r\nwithout trial. Their chief, the unfortunate Alexander of Glenstrae\r\nsurrendered to his enemy the Earl of Argyle, with eighteen of his\r\nfollowers, on condition that he might be taken safely out of Scotland.\r\nBut the severity of Government stopped not here. The very name of Gregor\r\nwas blotted out, by an order in Council, from the names of Scotland.\r\nThose who had hitherto borne it were commanded to change it under pain\r\nof death, and were forbidden to retain the appellations which they had\r\nbeen accustomed from their infancy to cherish. Those who had been at\r\nGlenfruin were also deprived of their weapons, excepting a pointless\r\nknife to cut their victuals. They were never to assemble in any number\r\nexceeding four; and by an Act of Parliament passed in 1617, these laws\r\nwere extended to the rising generation, lest as the children of the\r\nproscribed parents grew up, the strength of the clan should be restored.\r\n\r\nFor these severe acts, the only apology that can be offered is the\r\nunbridled fury and cruelty of the Macgregors, when irritated; of which\r\nit is necessary to mention one instance, as an example of the many left\r\non record, of which the clan were convicted.\r\n\r\nIn the battle of Glenfruin, which James had visited so rigorously upon\r\nthe Macgregors, the greater part of those who bore the name of Colquhoun\r\nwere exterminated. Yet a still more savage act was perpetrated after\r\nthe day was won.\r\n\r\nThe town of Dumbarton contained, at that time, a seminary famous for\r\nlearning, where many of the Colquhouns, as well as the sons of the\r\nneighbouring gentry, were sent for education. Upon hearing of the\r\nencounter at Glenfruin, eighty of these high-spirited boys set off to\r\njoin their relatives; but the Colquhouns, anxious for the safety of\r\ntheir young kinsfolk, would not permit them to join in the fight, but\r\nlocked them up in a barn for safety. Here they remained, until the event\r\nof the day left the Macgregors masters of what might well be called \"the\r\nGlen of Sorrow.\" The boys, growing impatient for their release, became\r\nnoisy; when the Macgregors, discovering their hiding-place, and\r\nthirsting for vengeance, set fire to the barn, and the young inmates\r\nwere consumed. According to another account, they were all put to the\r\nsword by one of the guard, a Macgregor, whose distinctive appellation\r\nwas Ciar Mohr, \"the mouse-coloured man.\" When the chief of the\r\nMacgregor's clan repaired to the barn, and, knowing that the boys were\r\nthe sons of gentlemen, was desirous of ensuring their safety, he asked\r\ntheir guards where they were. When told of what had occurred, Macgregor\r\nbroke out into the exclamation, that \"his clan was ruined.\" The sad\r\nevent was commemorated, until the year 1757, by an annual procession of\r\nthe Dumbarton youths, to a field at some distance from their school,\r\nwhere they enacted the melancholy ceremonial of a mock funeral, over\r\nwhich they set up a loud lamentation. The site of the farm where this\r\nscene was enacted is still pointed out; and near it runs a rivulet, the\r\nGaelic name of which signifies \"the burn of the young ghosts:\" so deep\r\nwas the memory of this horrible deed.[101]\r\n\r\nA fearful retribution followed the clan for years. They had no friend at\r\nCourt to plead their cause; and the most cruel hardships became the lot\r\nof the innocent, as well as the guilty, of their clan. The country was\r\nfilled with troops ready to destroy them, so that all who were able,\r\nwere forced to fly to rocks, caverns, and to hide themselves among the\r\nwoods. Few of the Macgregors, at this period of the Scottish history,\r\nwere permitted to die a natural death.\r\n\r\nAs an inducement to the murder of these wretched people, a reward was\r\noffered for every head of a Macgregor that was conveyed to the Privy\r\nCouncil at Edinburgh. Those who died a natural death were buried in\r\nsilence and secrecy by their kinsfolk, for the graves of the persecuted\r\nclan were not respected; the bodies of the dead being exhumed, and the\r\nheads cut off, to be sent to the Council. Never has there been, in the\r\nhistory of mankind, a more signal instance of national odium than that\r\nwhich pursued this brave, though violent race. The spirit in which they\r\nwere denounced has in it little of the character of justice, and reminds\r\nus of the vengeance of the Jewish people upon the different hostile\r\ntribes to whom they were opposed.\r\n\r\nIn process of time, the last remnant of the lands pertaining to the\r\nMacgregors was bestowed upon Archibald, seventh Earl of Argyle, whose\r\nfamily had profited largely by the destruction of the clan: for every\r\nMacgregor whom they had destroyed, they had received a reward. In 1611,\r\nthe Earl was commanded to root out this thievish and barbarous race; a\r\ncommission which he executed remorselessly, dragging the parents to\r\ndeath, and leaving their offspring to misery and to revenge; for the\r\ndeep consciousness of their wrongs grew up with the young, and prepared\r\nthem for deeds of violence and vengeance.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the severities of the Stuarts towards the Macgregors,\r\nthe loyalty of the clan continued unimpeachable. It was appreciated by\r\none who is not celebrated for remembering benefits. Charles the Second\r\nhad, in 1663, the grace to remove the proscription from the Macgregors,\r\nby an Act which was passed in the first Scottish Parliament after his\r\nRestoration. He permitted them the use of their family name, and other\r\nprivileges of his liege subjects, assigning as a reason for this act of\r\nfavour, that the loyalty and affection of those who were once called\r\nMacgregors, during the late troubles, might justly wipe off all former\r\nreproach from their clan. This act of grace, according to the anonymous\r\nwriter quoted in the commencement of this memoir, was to be accounted\r\nfor by the prevalent licentiousness of that monarch's reign. It gave,\r\nindeed, but little satisfaction to the nonconforming Presbyterians, who\r\nsaw with resentment that the penalties unjustly imposed upon themselves\r\nwere relaxed in favour of the Macgregors. But this dissatisfaction was\r\nof short duration. After the Revolution, \"an influence,\" says Sir Walter\r\nScott, \"inimical to this unfortunate clan, said to be the same with that\r\nwhich afterwards dictated the massacre of Glencoe, occasioned the\r\nreaction of the penal statutes against the Macgregors.\"[102] It is,\r\nhowever, consolatory to find that the proscription was not acted upon\r\nduring the reign of William. The name of Macgregor was again heard in\r\npublic halls, in parliament, and courts of justice. Still, however,\r\nwhilst the statutes remained, it could not legally be borne. Attempts\r\nwere made to restore the appellation of clan Alb, but nothing was\r\ndecided; when, at length, all necessity for such an alteration was done\r\naway by an Act of Parliament abolishing forever the penal statutes\r\nagainst the clan.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Macgregors were still a proscribed race, Robert Macgregor\r\nCampbell, or Robert Roy, so called among his kindred, in the adoption of\r\na Celtic phrase, expressive of his ruddy complexion and red hair,\r\nappeared as their champion. At the time of his birth, to bear the name\r\nof Macgregor was felony; and the descendant of King Alpin adopted the\r\nmaiden name of his mother, a daughter of Campbell of Fanieagle, in order\r\nto escape the penalty of disobedience. His father, Donald Macgregor of\r\nGlengyle, was a lieutenant-colonel in the King's service: his ancestry\r\nwas deduced from Ciar Mohr, \"the mouse-coloured man,\" who had slain the\r\nyoung students at the battle of Glenfruin.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Allaster Macgregor of Glenstrae, the last chieftain,\r\nthe office of chief had ceased to be held by any representative of the\r\nscattered remnant of this hunted tribe. Various families had ranged\r\nthemselves under the guidance of chieftains, which, among Highlanders,\r\nsignifies the head of a branch of a tribe, in contradistinction to that\r\nof chief, who is the leader of the whole name.[103] The chieftain of\r\nGlengyle lived in the mountainous region between Loch Lomond and Loch\r\nKatrine; his right to his territories there might or might not be legal;\r\nit was far more convenient to his neighbours to waive the question with\r\nany member of this fierce race, than to inquire too rigidly into the\r\ntenure by which the lands were held.\r\n\r\nRob Roy, though he deduced his origin from a younger son of the Laird of\r\nMacgregor, was one of a family who had, within the preceding century,\r\nbeen of humble fortunes. His great-grandfather had been a cotter; from\r\nhis grandfather he inherited the generous temper and the daring spirit\r\nwhich, more or less, characterized the clan. Callum, or Malcolm, had\r\nbeen outlawed for an attempt to carry off an heiress, but obtained his\r\npardon for saving the life of his enemy, the Duke of Argyle. The date of\r\nRob Roy's birth is uncertain, but is supposed to have taken place about\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century; consequently, after the period\r\nwhen his clan had endured every variety of fortune, from the cruel\r\nedicts of James the Sixth to the consolatory acts of Charles the Second.\r\n\r\nThe education of this extraordinary man was limited; and he is said not\r\nto have exhibited in his youth any striking traits of the intrepidity\r\nwhich distinguished him in after life. But he was endowed with a\r\nvigorous intellect, and with an enthusiasm which had been deepened by\r\nthe peculiar circumstances of his clan and kinsfolk. It is impossible to\r\ncomprehend the character of Rob Roy, unless we look into the history of\r\nhis race, as we have briefly done, and consider how strong must have\r\nbeen the impressions which hereditary feuds, and wrongs visited upon\r\nfather and child, had made upon a mind of no common order.\r\n\r\nHis youth was occupied in acquiring the rude accomplishments of the age.\r\nIn the management of the broadsword the ardent and daring boy soon\r\nacquired proficiency; his frame was robust and muscular, and his arm of\r\nunusual length. At an early age he is said by tradition to have tried\r\nhis powers in a predatory excursion, of which he was the leader. This\r\nwas in the year 1691, and it was called the herdship, or devastation of\r\nKippen, in the Lennox. No lives were sacrificed, but the marauding\r\nsystem was carried to its extent.\r\n\r\nThe young Macgregor was educated in the Presbyterian faith. \"He was\r\nnot,\" says his biographer,[104] \"free from those superstitious notions\r\nso prevalent in his country; and, although few men possessed more\r\nstrength of mind in resisting the operation of false and gloomy tenets,\r\nhe was sometimes led away from the principles he had adopted, to a\r\nbelief in supernatural appearances.\" Nor was it likely that it should be\r\notherwise; for the wildest dreams of fancy were cherished in the\r\nseclusion of the region, then inconceivably retired and remote, in which\r\nRob Roy is said to have passed days in silent admiration of Nature in\r\nher grandest aspects; for the man who afterwards appeared so stern and\r\nrugged to his enemies, was accessible to the tenderest feelings, and to\r\nthe most generous sympathies.[105]\r\n\r\nAlthough his father had succeeded in military life, Rob Roy was destined\r\nto a far more humble occupation. The discrepancy between the Scottish\r\npride of ancestry and the lowly tracks which are occasionally chalked\r\nout for persons of the loftiest pretensions to origin, is manifest in\r\nthe destination of Rob Roy. He became a dealer in cattle. It was, it is\r\ntrue, the custom for landed proprietors, as well as their tenantry, to\r\ndeal in the trade of grazing and selling cattle. In those days, no\r\nLowlanders, nor any English drovers, had the audacity to enter the\r\nHighlands.\r\n\r\n\"The cattle,\" says Sir Walter Scott, \"which were the staple commodity of\r\nthe mountains, were escorted down to fairs, on the borders of the\r\nLowlands, by a party of Highlanders, with their arms rattling round\r\nthem; and who dealt, however, in all faith and honour with their\r\nsouthern customers.\" After describing the nature of the affrays which\r\nwere the result of such collision, Sir Walter remarks, \"A slash or two,\r\nor a broken head, was easily accommodated, and as the trade was of\r\nbenefit to both parties, trifling skirmishes were not allowed to\r\ninterrupt its harmony.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time, the speculations in which Rob Roy engaged were\r\nprofitable; he took a tract of land in Balquhidder for the purpose of\r\ngrazing, and his success soon raised him in the estimation of the\r\ncounty. But his cattle were often carried away by hordes of big robbers\r\nfrom Inverness, Ross, and Sutherland, and he was obliged, in defence, to\r\nmaintain a party of men to repel these incursions. Hence the warlike\r\ntastes which were afterwards more fully displayed.\r\n\r\nThe death of his father placed Rob Roy in an important situation in his\r\ncounty; he became, moreover, guardian to his nephew, Gregor of Macgregor\r\nof Glengyle,--a position which gave him great influence with the clan.\r\nHe had now become the proprietor of Craig Royston; but his ordinary\r\ndwelling was at Inversnaid, from which place he took his appellation,\r\nMacgregor of Inversnaid. These estates were of considerable extent, but\r\nof small value: they extended from the head of Loch Lomond twelve miles\r\nalong its eastern border, and stretched into the interior of the\r\ncountry, partly around the base of Ben Lomond. From these estates Rob\r\nRoy assumed sometimes the title of Craig Royston, sometimes that of\r\nBaron of Inversnaid,--a term long applied in Scotland to puisne\r\nlairds.[106]\r\n\r\nThe influence of an energetic and powerful mind was now plainly\r\nexhibited in the celebrity which Rob Roy soon acquired in the\r\nneighbouring counties. The Macgregors had a peculiar constitution in\r\ntheir clanship, which rendered them compact and formidable as a body. In\r\nall the forays so common at that period, Rob Roy took little or no part;\r\nyet the terror of his name caused him to receive all the credit of much\r\nthat occurred in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nThree great noblemen, bitter enemies, sought his alliance; of these one\r\nwas James the first Duke of Montrose, and Archibald tenth Earl of\r\nArgyle, who were opposed to each other not only in political opinions,\r\nbut from personal dislike. Montrose deemed it essential to conciliate\r\nRob Roy as a matter of speculation, and entered into a sort of\r\npartnership with the far-famed drover in the buying and selling of\r\ncattle, of which Rob Roy was considered an excellent judge. Argyle, on\r\nthe other hand, was conscious of the injuries which his ancestors had\r\ninflicted on the Macgregors, and was inclined to befriend Rob Roy from\r\ncompassion, and a sense of justice. The Earl was also flattered by the\r\nLaird's having assumed the name of Campbell, which he regarded as a\r\ncompliment to himself. But the overtures of Argyle were at first\r\nspurned by Rob Roy, whose alliance with the Marquis of Montrose\r\nincreased his hatred of Argyle. He was afterwards won over to more\r\nmoderate sentiments, and a lasting friendship was eventually formed\r\nbetween him and Argyle.\r\n\r\nThe friendship and patronage of Montrose were secure until money\r\ntransactions, the usual source of alienations and bickerings, produced\r\ndistrust on the one hand, and bitterness on the other. Montrose had\r\nadvanced Rob Roy certain sums to carry on his speculations: they were\r\nsuccessful until the defalcation of a third and inferior partner\r\nprevented Rob Roy from repaying the Marquis the money due to him. He was\r\nrequired to give up his lands to satisfy the demands upon him. For a\r\ntime he refused, but ultimately he was compelled by a law-suit to\r\nmortgage his estates to Montrose with an understanding that they were to\r\nbe restored to him whenever he could pay the money. Some time afterwards\r\nhe made an attempt to recover his estate by the payment of his debts;\r\nbut he was at first amused by excuses, and afterwards deprived of his\r\nproperty. Such is the simple statement of his partial biographer; but\r\nSir Walter Scott gives the story a darker colouring. In his preface to\r\nRob Roy he mentions that Rob Roy absconded, taking with him the sum of\r\none thousand pounds which he had obtained from different gentlemen in\r\nScotland for the purpose of buying cattle. In 1712 an advertisement to\r\nthat effect was put into the daily papers repeatedly; but the active\r\nHighlander was beyond the reach of law. To this period we must assign a\r\ntotal change in the habits and characteristics of Rob Roy, who now began\r\na lawless and marauding course of life. He went up into the Highlands\r\nwhere he was followed by one whose character has been variously\r\nrepresented--Mary Macgregor of Comar, his wife. According to one\r\naccount, she was by no means the masculine and cruel being whom Scott\r\nhas so powerfully described; yet, from several traits, it is obvious\r\nthat she was one of the most determined of her sex, and that her natural\r\nboldness of spirit was exaggerated by an insult which was never\r\nforgiven, either by herself or by her husband. This was the forcible\r\nexpulsion of herself and her family from their home at Inversnaid by\r\nGraham of Killearn, one of Montrose's agents; and the cruel act was\r\naccompanied by circumstances which nothing but death could blot from the\r\nmemory of the outraged and injured Macgregor. The loss of property was\r\nnothing when compared with that one galling recollection.\r\n\r\nThe kind and once honourable Rob Roy was now driven to desperation. His\r\nnatural capacity for warlike affairs had been improved in the collection\r\nof the black mail, or protection fees; a service of danger, in which\r\nmany a bloody conflict with freebooters had shown the Macgregors of what\r\nmaterials their leader was composed. The black mail was a private\r\ncontribution, often compulsatory, for the maintenance of the famous\r\nblack watch, an independent corps of provincial militia, and so called\r\nfrom the colour of their dress, in contradistinction to the red\r\nsoldiers, or _leidar dearag_. \"From the time they were first embodied,\"\r\nwrites General Stewart, \"till they were regimented, the Highlanders\r\ncontinued to wear the dress of their country. This, as it consisted so\r\nmuch of the black, green, and blue tartan, gave them a dark and sombre\r\nappearance in comparison with the bright uniform of the regulars, who,\r\nat that time, had coats waistcoats, and breeches of scarlet cloth. Hence\r\nthe term _dhu_, or black, as applied to this corps.\"[107]\r\n\r\nIn collecting both the imposts laid on for the maintenance of this\r\ncorps, and in enforcing the black mail, Rob Roy had already gained the\r\nconfidence of the better classes, whilst, by his exploits, he had taught\r\nthe freebooter to tremble at his name. His journeys to England had not,\r\neither, been unprofitable to him in gaining friends. By a strict regard\r\nto his word, a true Highland quality, he had gained confidence; whilst\r\nhis open and engaging demeanour had procured him friends.\r\n\r\nSoon after his expulsion from his property, Rob Roy travelled into\r\nEngland to collect a sum of money which was due to him. On returning\r\nthrough Moffat, his generous indignation was aroused by seeing the\r\npenalty of the law inflicted upon a young girl for fanaticism: two of\r\nher kinsmen had already suffered. As a party of soldiers were preparing\r\nto carry the girl, bound hand and foot, to a river, Rob Roy interposed;\r\nand, receiving an insolent reply, he sprang upon the soldiers and in an\r\ninstant released the young woman, by plunging eight of her guards into\r\nthe water. He then drew his claymore, and cut the cords which bound the\r\nintended victim. A short skirmish left him master of the field.\r\n\r\nRob Roy now prepared to remove from his dwelling at Inversnaid, into one\r\nmore remote, and protected by its natural position. This was Craig\r\nRoyston, or, as it is sometimes spelt, Craigrostan, whither Rob Roy\r\nremoved his furniture and other effects. A tract, entitled \"The Highland\r\nRogue,\" published during the lifetime of Rob Roy, contains a striking\r\ndescription of this almost inaccessible retreat. It is situated on the\r\nborders of Loch Lomond, and is surrounded with stupendous rocks and\r\nmountains. The passages along these heights are so narrow, that two men\r\ncannot walk abreast; \"It is a place,\" adds the same writer, \"of such\r\nstrength and safety, that one person well acquainted with it, and\r\nsupplied with ammunition, might easily destroy a considerable army if\r\nthey came to attack him, and he, at the same time, need not so much as\r\nbe seen by them.\" For this romantic scene, Rob Roy quitted Inversnaid;\r\nhenceforth his occupation as a grazier and drover, and his character as\r\na country gentleman, were lost in that of a freebooter. Many anecdotes\r\nhave been related of his feats in the dangerous course which he\r\nhenceforth adopted: but of these, some are so extraordinary, as to be\r\nincredible; others are perfectly consistent with the daring spirit of a\r\nman who had vowed to avenge his wrongs.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Montrose was the first object of his wrath; accordingly,\r\nhearing that the tenantry of the Duke had notice to pay their rents, he\r\nmustered his men, and visiting these gentlemen, compelled them to pay\r\nhim the money, giving them, nevertheless receipts, which discharged them\r\nof any future call from Montrose. This practice he carried on with\r\nimpunity for several years, until a more flagrant outrage drew down the\r\nanger of his enemy.\r\n\r\nThis was no less than the abduction of the Duke's factor, Killearn, who\r\nhad formerly expelled the family of Rob Roy from Inversnaid. Killearn\r\nhad gone to Chapellaroch in Stirlingshire, for the purpose of collecting\r\nrents; he anticipated, on this occasion, no interruption to his office,\r\nbecause Rob Roy had caused it to be given out, by proclamation, some\r\ndays before, that he had gone to Ireland. Towards evening, nevertheless,\r\nhe made his appearance before the inn at Chapellaroch, his piper playing\r\nbefore him; his followers were stationed in a neighbouring wood. The\r\nrents had just been collected, when the sound of the bagpipes announced\r\nto Killearn the approach of his enemy. The factor sprang up, and threw\r\nthe bags, full of money, into a loft. Rob Roy entered, with the usual\r\nsalutations, laid down his sword, and sat down to partake of the\r\nentertainment. No sooner was the repast ended, than he desired his piper\r\nto strike up a tune. In a few minutes, by this signal, six armed men\r\nentered the room; when Rob Roy, taking hold of his sword, asked the\r\nfactor, \"How he had prospered in his collection of the rents?\" \"I have\r\ngot nothing yet,\" replied the trembling Killearn; \"I have not begun to\r\ncollect.\" \"No, no, Chamberlain,\" cried Rob Roy, \"falsehood will not do\r\nfor me. I demand your book.\" The book was produced, the money was found\r\nand delivered to Rob Roy, who gave his usual receipt. After this, the\r\nunfortunate factor was carried off to an island near the east of Loch\r\nKatrine, where he was confined a considerable time; and when he was\r\nreleased, was warned not to collect the rents of the country in future,\r\nas Rob Roy intended to do so himself,--the more especially as the lands\r\nhad originally belonged to the Macgregors, and he was, therefore, only\r\nreclaiming his own.[108]\r\n\r\nThis predatory war against the Duke of Montrose was carried on for a\r\nconsiderable time. It was favoured by the nature of the country over\r\nwhich the freebooter ruled triumphant, and by the secret good wishes of\r\nthe Highlanders who resided in the neighbourhood. No roads were at that\r\ntime formed in this region of singular beauty. Narrow valleys, thinly\r\ninhabited, and surrounded by forests and wilds, and guarded by rocks,\r\npasses, and other features of natural strength, afforded to Rob Roy all\r\nthose advantages which he, who knew every defence which Nature gave to\r\nmarauders in those retired haunts, could well appreciate.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the Highlanders were also, at this time, essentially\r\nwarlike. \"The use of arms,\" to borrow a description from an anonymous\r\nwriter, \"formed their common occupation, and the affairs of war their\r\nordinary pursuit. They appeared on all public occasions, at market, and\r\neven at church, with their broadswords and their dirks; and, more\r\nrecently, when the use of fire-arms became general, they seldom\r\ntravelled without a musket and pistol.\" The clan Macgregor possessed\r\nthese military tastes in an inordinate degree; and the wars of the\r\nforegoing century had accustomed them to a degree of union and\r\ndiscipline not, at that period, common among the Highlanders, who were\r\nconsidered, in those respects, as superior to their Lowland\r\nbrethren.[109] The vicinity of the rich districts of the Lowlands gave a\r\nrich stimulus to the appetite for plunder natural to a martial and\r\nimpoverished people. Above all, their energies were inspired by an\r\nundying sense of ancient and present injuries, and the remembrance of\r\ntheir sufferings was never erased from their minds. At this time, the\r\nmost disturbed districts in Scotland were those nearest to the Lowlands;\r\nthe bitterness of political feelings was added to the sense of\r\ninjustice, and the loss of lands. Rob Roy knew well how to avail himself\r\nof this additional incentive to violence; he avowed his determination to\r\nmolest all who were not of Jacobite principles; and he put that\r\nresolution into active practice.\r\n\r\nThe character of the individual who exercised so singular a control over\r\nhis followers, and over the district in which he lived, had changed\r\nsince his early, dreamy days, or since the period of his honest\r\nexertions as a drover. Rob Roy had become in repute with Robin Hood of\r\nthe Lowlands. His personal appearance added greatly to the impression of\r\nhis singular qualities. The author of \"the Highland Rogue\" describes him\r\nas a man of prodigious strength, and of such uncommon stature as to\r\napproach almost to a gigantic size. He wore a beard above a foot long,\r\nand his face as well as his body was covered with dark red hair, from\r\nwhich his nick-name originated. The description given by Sir Walter\r\nScott does not entirely correspond with this portraiture. \"His stature,\"\r\nsays that writer, \"was not of the tallest, but his person was uncommonly\r\nstrong and compact.\" The great peculiarity of his frame was the great\r\nlength of his arms, owing to which he could, without stooping, tie the\r\ngarters of his Highland hose, which are placed two inches below the\r\nknee. His countenance was sternly expressive in the hour of peril; but,\r\nat calmer moments, it wore that frank and kindly aspect which wins upon\r\nthe affections of our species. His frame was so muscular, that his knee\r\nwas described as resembling that of a Highland bull, evincing strength\r\nsimilar to that animal. His exercise of the broadsword was, even in\r\nthose days, superlative; and his intimate knowledge of the wild country\r\nover which he may be said to have ruled, gave him as great an advantage\r\nas his personal prowess. To these qualifications may be added another,\r\nperhaps more important still,--that quick perception of character, and\r\nthat penetration into human motives, without which no mind can obtain a\r\nmastery over another.\r\n\r\nTo these characteristics were added a fearless and generous spirit, a\r\nhatred of oppression, and compassion for the oppressed. Although\r\ndescended from the dark murderer of the young students, Rob Roy had none\r\nof the ferocity of his race in his composition. He was never the cause\r\nof unnecessary bloodshed, nor the contriver of any act of cruel revenge.\r\n\"Like Robin Hood,\" says Scott, \"he was a kind and gentle robber, and\r\nwhile he took from the rich, he was liberal to the poor. This might in\r\npart be policy, but the universal tradition of the country speaks it to\r\nhave arisen from a better motive. All whom I have conversed with, and I\r\nhave in my youth seen some who knew Rob Roy personally, gave him the\r\ncharacter of a benevolent, humane man, in his way.\"\r\n\r\nThat \"way\" was certainly not followed out on the most approved\r\nprinciples of morality, and he is well described as resembling in his\r\ncode of morals an \"Arab chief.\" But if ever man may be excused for a\r\npredatory course of life, the chieftain, as he was now called, of the\r\nMacgregors may be pardoned for actions which, in those who had suffered\r\nless from wrong and oppression, would be deemed unpardonable.\r\n\r\nThe revival of that latent affection for the Stuarts which ever existed\r\nin the Highlands, greatly favoured the success of Rob Roy in his\r\nunsettled and exciting career. Many of the chieftains were now arraying\r\ntheir people to follow them to the field upon a summons from their\r\nrightful Prince; and even the Duke of Argyle, who had at first attached\r\nhimself to the Prince of Orange, was wavering in his resolutions, never\r\nhaving been restored to his property and jurisdiction since the\r\nattainder and death of his father. Under these circumstances the\r\nassistance of Rob Roy became of infinite importance to Argyle. The most\r\ndeadly feuds raged between him and Montrose, who, upon hearing that Roy\r\nwas on friendly terms with Argyle, had sent to offer to the freebooter\r\nnot only that he would withdraw his claims on his estate, but also that\r\nhe would give him a sum of money if he would go to Edinburgh and give\r\ninformation against Argyle for treasonable practices. But this base\r\noverture was indignantly rejected by Rob Roy, who deigned not even to\r\nreply to the letter, but contented himself with forwarding it to Argyle.\r\nHence the bitter enmity of Montrose towards the Macgregors, during the\r\nwhole course of his future life.[110]\r\n\r\nFrom this time Rob Roy kept no measures with his enemies, and his\r\nincursions were so frequent and so dreaded, that in 1713 a garrison was\r\nestablished at Inversnaid to check the irruptions of his party. But Rob\r\nRoy was too subtle and too powerful for his enemies. He bribed an old\r\nwoman of his clan, who lived within the garrison, to distribute whiskey\r\nto the soldiers. Whilst they were in a state of intoxication, he set\r\nfire to the fort. He was suspected of this outrage, but still it passed\r\nwith impunity, for no one dared to attack him; the affair was passed\r\nover in silence, and the Government re-established the fort of\r\nInversnaid.\r\n\r\nNumbers of the desperate and vagrant part of his clansmen now crowded\r\naround Rob Roy at Craig Royston, and swore obedience to him as their\r\nchieftain. The country was kept in continual awe by these marauders, who\r\nbroke into houses and carried off the inmates to Craig Royston, there to\r\nremain until heavy ransoms were paid. Their chieftain, meantime, laughed\r\nat justice, and defied even the great Montrose. He had spies in every\r\ndirection, who brought him intelligence of all that was going on. No\r\nperson could travel near the abode of this mountain bandit without risk\r\nof being captured and carried to Craig Royston. In many instances the\r\ntreatment of the prisoners is said to have been harsh; in some it was\r\ntempered by the relentings of Rob Roy. On one occasion, having seized\r\nupon a gentleman whose means had been reduced by great losses, he not\r\nonly set him at liberty, but gave him money to pay his travelling\r\nexpenses, and sent him in one of his own boats as far as he could travel\r\nby water.\r\n\r\nThe incursions of this Scottish Robin Hood were contrived with the\r\nutmost caution and secrecy, and executed with almost incredible\r\nrapidity. No one knew when he would appear, nor in what direction he\r\nwould turn his dreaded attention. He is even said to have threatened the\r\nDuke of Montrose in his own residence at Buchanan. His enterprises were,\r\nhowever, not always contrived for a serious end, but sometimes partook\r\nof the love of a practical joke, which is a feature in the Scottish\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\"The Highland Rogue\" gives the following account of one of his\r\nexploits:--[111]\r\n\r\n\"Rob Roy's creditors now grew almost past hopes of recovering their\r\nmoney. They offered a large reward to any that should attempt it\r\nsuccessfully; but not an officer could be found who was willing to run\r\nsuch a hazard of his life; till at length a bailiff, who had no small\r\nopinion of his own courage and conduct, undertook the affair.\r\n\r\n\"Having provided a good horse and equipt himself for the journey, he set\r\nout without any attendance, and in a few hours arrived at Craigroiston,\r\nwhere, meeting with some of Rob Roy's men, he told them he had business\r\nof great importance to deliver to their master in private. Rob Roy\r\nhaving notice of it, ordered them to give him admittance. As soon as he\r\ncame in, the Captain demanded his business. 'Sir,' (says the other)\r\n'tho' you have had misfortunes in the world, yet knowing you to be in\r\nyour nature an honourable gentleman, I made bold to visit you upon\r\naccount of a small debt, which I don't doubt but you will discharge if\r\nit lies in your power.' 'Honest friend,' (says M'Gregor) 'I am sorry\r\nthat at present I cannot answer your demand; but if your affairs will\r\npermit you to lodge at my house to-night, I hope by to-morrow I shall be\r\nbetter provided.' The bailiff complied, and was overjoyed at the success\r\nhe had met with. He was entertained with abundance of civility, and went\r\nto bed at a seasonable time.\r\n\r\n\"Rob Roy then ordered an old suit of clothes to be stuffed full of\r\nstraw, not wholly unlike one of the Taffies that the mob dress up and\r\nexpose upon the 1st of March, in ridicule of the Welshmen; only, instead\r\nof a hat with a leek in it, they bound his head with a napkin. The\r\nghastly figure being completely formed, they hung it upon the arm of a\r\ntree directly opposite to the window where the officer lay: he rising in\r\nthe morning and finding his door locked, steps back to the window and\r\nopens the casement, in expectation of finding some of the servants,\r\nwhen, to his great astonishment, he cast his eye upon the dreary object\r\nbefore him: he knew not what to make of it; he began to curse his\r\nenterprise, and wished himself safe in his own house again. In the midst\r\nof his consternation, he spied one of the servants, and calling to him,\r\ndesired him to open the door. The fellow seemed surprised at finding it\r\nlocked, begged his pardon, and protested it was done by mistake. As soon\r\nas the bailiff got out, 'Prithee friend,' (says he) 'what is it that\r\nhangs upon yonder tree?' 'O sir,' (says the other) ''tis a bailiff, a\r\ncursed rogue that has the impudence to come hither to my master, and dun\r\nhim for an old debt; and therefore he ordered him to be hanged there\r\nfor a warning to all his fraternity. I think the impudent dog deserved\r\nit, and in troth, we have been commended by all his neighbours for so\r\ndoing.' The catchpole was strangely terrified at this account, but\r\nhoping that the servant did not know him to be one of the same\r\nprofession, he walked away with a seeming carelessness, till he thought\r\nhimself out of sight, and then looking round and finding the way clear,\r\nhe threw off his coat and ran for his life, not resting, nor so much as\r\nlooking behind him, till he came to a village about three or four miles\r\noff; where, when he had recovered breath, he told the story of his\r\ndanger and escape, just as he apprehended it to be. Rob Roy was so\r\npleased with the success of his frolic, that the next day he sent home\r\nthe bailiff's coat and horse, and withal let his neighbours know that it\r\nwas only a contrivance to frighten him away; by which means the poor\r\nrogue became the common subject of the people's diversion.\"\r\n\r\nThis adventure was immediately recounted to the Governor of Stirling\r\nCastle by the messenger, who hastened to that fortress. A party of\r\nsoldiers was ordered out to seize Rob Roy; but the chieftain gained\r\nintelligence of their approach, and Rob Roy retreated to the hills;\r\nwhilst the country of the Macgregors was roused, and put into a state of\r\ndefence. The soldiers, meantime, worn out with their search among the\r\nhills, took possession of an empty house and filled it with heath for\r\nbeds. The Macgregors, always active and watchful, set fire to the house,\r\nand drove their enemies from their post. Thus Rob Roy escaped the\r\npursuit of justice, the troopers being obliged to return to Stirling\r\nCastle. He was not always so fortunate as to avoid imminent danger; yet\r\nhe had a faithful friend who watched over his safety, and who would have\r\nwillingly sacrificed his life for that of Macgregor. This was the\r\nchieftain's lieutenant, Fletcher, or Macanaleister, \"the _Little John_\r\nof his band,\" and an excellent marksman. \"It happened,\" writes Sir W.\r\nScott, \"that MacGregor and his party had been surprised and dispersed by\r\na superior force of horse and foot, and the word was given to 'split and\r\nsquander.' Jack shifted for himself; but a bold dragoon attached himself\r\nto pursuit of Rob Roy, and overtaking him, struck at him with his\r\nbroadsword. A plate of iron in his bonnet saved Mac Gregor from being\r\ncut down to the teeth; but the blow was heavy enough to bear him to the\r\nground, crying as he fell, 'O Macanaleister, there is naething in her,'\r\n(_i.e._ in the gun:) the trooper at the same time exclaiming, 'D--n ye,\r\nyour mother never brought your nightcap;' had his arm raised for a\r\nsecond blow, when Macanaleister fired, and the ball pierced the\r\ndragoon.\"\r\n\r\nHis feats had, however, in most instances, the character of an\r\nunwarrantable oppression, notwithstanding that they were sometimes\r\naccompanied by traits of a generous and chivalric spirit. Very few of\r\nthose who lived in his neighbourhood could depend upon an hour's\r\nsecurity, without paying the tax of black mail, which he audaciously\r\ndemanded; and the licentiousness of his reckless troop was the theme of\r\njust reprobation, and the cause of terror to many innocent and peaceable\r\ninhabitants in the west of Perth and Stirlingshire. On one occasion\r\nCampbell, of Abernchile, who had found it convenient to submit to the\r\nassessment of the black mail, neglected the regular payment of the tax.\r\nRob Roy, angry at his disobedience, rode up to his house, knocked at the\r\ndoor, and demanded admittance. A party of friends was at dinner with the\r\nhost, and the door was closed against Macgregor. Rob Roy sounded his\r\nhorn; instantly his followers appeared in view. Rob Roy ordered them to\r\ndrive off the cattle from the estate: Abernchile was forced to make an\r\nhumble apology in order to avert his wrath, and to pay the exaction.\r\n\r\nAnother enterprise of Rob Roy's was directed to the welfare of his ward\r\nand relative, Macgregor of Glengyle. The estates of Glengyle were\r\npledged, or, as it is called in Scotland, \"under a contract of wadset.\"\r\nThe creditor was a man of influence and fortune; but, like most other\r\nScottish proprietors who were enabled to take advantage of the wadset\r\nrights, he was grasping and merciless. It was not uncommon, in those\r\ntimes, for men to whom estates had been pledged, to take the most unfair\r\nadvantages of small and needy proprietors; and from the great\r\nsuperiority which a superior claimed over his vassals, it became almost\r\nimpossible for his inferiors to resist his rapacity, or to defeat his\r\ncunning.\r\n\r\nSome months before the period of redemption had expired, Rob Roy, aware\r\nof the danger to which his ward was exposed, raised a sum of money in\r\norder to redeem the pledge. It was pretended by the creditor, that the\r\nbond securing the power of redemption was lost; and since a few months\r\nonly of the period remained, a plan was formed by him for protracting\r\nthe settlement of the affair. Rob Roy, unhappily, was elsewhere\r\noccupied: the period expired; the young Macgregor ceased, therefore, to\r\nbe the proprietor of his estate; he was ordered to leave it, and to\r\nremove his attendants, cattle, and tenants within eight days. \"But law,\"\r\nas Dr. Johnson observes, \"is nothing without power.\" Before those eight\r\ndays had elapsed, Rob Roy had assembled his _gillies_, had followed his\r\ncreditor into Argyleshire, had met him, nevertheless, in Strathfillan,\r\nand had carried him prisoner to an inn. There the unjust creditor was\r\ndesired to give up the bond, and told to send for it from his castle.\r\nThe affrighted man promised all that could be required of him; Rob Roy\r\nwould not trust him, but sent two of his followers for the bond, which\r\nwas brought at the end of two days. When it was delivered to Macgregor,\r\nhe refused to pay the sum of redemption, telling the creditor that the\r\nmoney was too small a fine for the wrong which he had inflicted; and\r\nthat he might be thankful to escape as well as he might.\r\n\r\nAgainst all acts of oppression, except those which he thought proper to\r\ncommit himself, Rob Roy waged war. He was the avenger of the injured,\r\nand the protector of the humble; and lest his own resources should prove\r\ninsufficient for these purposes, a contract was entered into with\r\nseveral neighbouring proprietors to combine, for the purposes of\r\ndefence, and protection to others.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Montrose and his agent, Graham of Killearn, were still the\r\nespecial objects of Macgregor's hatred. When a widow was persecuted by\r\nthe merciless factor, and distrained for rent, Rob Roy intercepted the\r\nofficers who went out against her, and gave them a severe chastisement;\r\nand a similar excursion was made in favour of any poor man who was\r\nobliged to pay a sum of money for rent. The collectors of the rent were\r\ndisarmed, and obliged to refund what they had received. Upon the same\r\nprinciple of might against right, Rob Roy supported his family and\r\nretainers upon the contents of a meal-store which Montrose kept at a\r\nplace called Moulin; and when any poor family in the neighbourhood were\r\nin want of meat, Rob Roy went to the store-keeper, ordered the quantity\r\nwhich he wanted, and directed the tenants to carry it away. There was no\r\npower either of resistance or complaint. If the parks of Montrose were\r\ncleared of their cattle, the Duke was obliged to bear the loss in\r\nsilence. At length, harassed by constant depredations, Montrose applied\r\nto the Privy Council for redress, and obtained the power of pursuing and\r\nrepressing robbers, and of recovering the goods stolen by them. But, in\r\nthis act, such was the dread of Rob Roy's power, that his name was\r\nintentionally omitted in the order in Council.\r\n\r\nThe retreat into which Rob Roy retired, in times of danger, was a cave\r\nat the base of Ben Lomond, and on the borders of the Loch. The entrance\r\nto this celebrated recess is extremely difficult from the precipitous\r\nheights which surround it. Mighty fragments of rock, partially overgrown\r\nwith brushwood and heather, guard the approach. Here Robert de Bruce\r\nsheltered himself from his enemies; and here Rob Roy, who had an\r\nenthusiastic veneration for that monarch, believed that he was securing\r\nto himself an appropriate retirement. It was, indeed, inaccessible to\r\nall but those who knew the rugged entrance; and here, had it not been\r\nfor the projects which brought the Chevalier St. George to England, Rob\r\nRoy might have defied, during his whole lifetime, the vengeance of\r\nMontrose. From this spot Macgregor could almost command the whole\r\ncountry around Loch Lomond; a passionate affection to the spot became\r\nthe feeling, not only of his mind, but of that of his wife, who, upon\r\nbeing compelled to quit the banks of Loch Lomond, gave way to her grief\r\nin a strain which obtained the name of \"Rob Roy's Lament.\"\r\n\r\nOf the exquisite beauty, and of the grandeur and interest of the scene\r\nof Rob Roy's seclusion, thousands can now form an estimate. Dr. Johnson\r\nwas no enthusiast when he thus coldly and briefly adverted to the\r\ncharacteristics of Loch Lomond. \"Had Loch Lomond been in a happier\r\nclimate, it would have been the boast of wealth and vanity to own one\r\nof the little spots which it incloses, and to have employed upon it all\r\nthe arts of embellishment. But as it is, the islets which court the\r\ngazer at a distance, disgust him at his approach, when he finds instead\r\nof soft lawns and shady thickets, nothing more than uncultivated\r\nruggedness.\"[112]\r\n\r\nFrom this retreat Rob Roy frequently emerged upon some mission of\r\ndestruction, or some errand of redress. His name was a terror to all who\r\nhad ever incurred his wrath; his depredations were soon extended to the\r\nLowlands. One night a report prevailed in Dumbarton, that Rob Roy\r\nintended to surprise the militia and to fire the town. It was resolved\r\nto anticipate this attack, and accordingly the militia made their way to\r\nCraig Royston; and having secured the boats on Loch Lomond, which\r\nbelonged to the Macgregors, they proceeded to seek for Rob Roy. But the\r\nchieftain had collected his followers, and, retreating into his cave, he\r\nlaughed at his enemies, who were forced to retire without encountering\r\nhim, the object of their search.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed remarkable, that outrages so audacious, and a power so\r\nimperative as that of Rob Roy, should have defied all control within\r\nforty miles of the city of Glasgow, an important and commercial city.\r\n\"Thus,\" as Sir Walter Scott observes, \"a character like his, blending\r\nthe wild virtues, the subtle policy, and unconstrained licence of an\r\nAmerican Indian, was flourishing in Scotland during the Augustan age of\r\nQueen Anne and George the First. Addison, it is probable, and Pope,\r\nwould have been considerably surprised if they had known that there\r\nexisted, in the same island with them, a personage of Rob Roy's peculiar\r\nhabits and profession.\"\r\n\r\nTo the various other traits in the character of Rob Roy, there was added\r\nthat tenacity of purpose, that obstinate and indefatigable hatred, which\r\nwere common to the Highlanders. Their feuds were, it is true,\r\nhereditary, and were implanted in their minds before the reason could\r\ncalm the passions. The fierce, implacable temper of the Macgregors had\r\nbeen aggravated by long-standing injuries and insults; among those who\r\nmight be considered the chief foes of their race were the heads of the\r\nhouse of Athole. An uncontrolled, vehement spirit of revenge against\r\nthat family burned in the breast of Rob Roy Macgregor; nor did he lose\r\nany opportunity of proving the sincerity of his professions of hatred.\r\n\r\nHitherto the wild feats of the marauder had met with continual success;\r\nno reverse had lessened his control over his followers, nor lowered his\r\nindividual pride. But at length his enemy, the Earl of Athole, had a\r\nbrief, but signal triumph over the dreaded chief. The circumstances\r\nunder which it occurred are the following:--\r\n\r\nEmboldened by his continued success, Rob Roy had descended into the\r\nplains, and headed an enterprise which was attended with the direst\r\nconsequences: so desolating were its effects, that it is known by the\r\nname of the \"Herriship of Kilrane.\" The outrage was severely taken up by\r\nGovernment, and a reward was offered for the head of the freebooter. It\r\nwas even resolved to explore his cave. One day, when on the banks of\r\nLochearn, attended by two of his followers, Rob Roy encountered seven\r\nmen, who required him to surrender; but the freebooter darted from their\r\nview, and climbed a neighbouring hill, whence he shot three of the\r\ntroopers, and dispersed the rest. This occurrence drove him, for some\r\ntime, from his stronghold on Loch Lomond.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Athole had deeply felt the insults of Rob Roy, and he now\r\ntook advantage of this temporary change of fortune to ensnare him. On a\r\nformer occasion he had made an ineffectual attempt to overcome\r\nMacgregor. The scene had taken place on the day of the funeral of Rob\r\nRoy's mother. This was at Balquhidder: when Rob Roy had beheld the party\r\nof the Earl's friends approaching, he grasped his sword, yet met the\r\nEarl with a smile, and affected to thank him for the honour of his\r\ncompany. The Earl replied, that his was not a visit of compliment: and\r\nthat Rob Roy must accompany him to Perth. Remonstrance was vain, and Rob\r\nRoy pretended compliance; but, whilst his friends looked on indignant\r\nand amazed, Macgregor drew his sword; the Earl instantly discharged a\r\npistol at him: it missed its mark, and, during a momentary pause, the\r\nsister of Rob Roy, and the wife of Glenfalloch, grasped Athole by the\r\nthroat and brought him to the ground. The clan meantime assembled in\r\nnumbers, and the Earl was thankful to be released from the fierce amazon\r\nwho held him, and to retire from the country of the Macgregors.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Athole now judged force to be unavailing, and he resolved to\r\ntry stratagem. After wandering, in consequence of the proclamation of\r\nGovernment, from place to place, Rob Roy was greeted by a friendly\r\nmessage from the Earl of Athole, inviting him to Blair Athole. Macgregor\r\nhad not forgotten the day of his mother's funeral. He acted, on this\r\noccasion, with the frankness of an honest and unsuspecting nature. He\r\ndoubted the Earl's sincerity; and he wrote to him, freely stating that\r\nhe did so. He was answered by the most solemn assurances of protection,\r\nnotwithstanding that all this time Athole was employed by Government to\r\nbring Rob Roy to justice. Macgregor was, however, deceived: he rode to\r\nBlair, attended only by one servant, and was received with the utmost\r\nprofessions of regard, but was requested to lay aside his dirk and\r\nsword, as the Countess of Athole would not suffer any armed man to enter\r\nthe castle. Rob Roy complied with Lord Athole's entreaty. What was his\r\nsurprise when the first remark made by Lady Athole was her surprise at\r\nhis appearing unarmed; Rob Roy then felt that he was betrayed. Angry\r\nwords, followed by a scuffle, ensued: the freebooter was overpowered;\r\nfor sixty men, armed, entered before he could strike a blow.\r\n\r\nRob Roy was carried towards Edinburgh. He had proceeded as far as\r\nLogierait, under a strong guard, when he contrived, with his usual\r\naddress and good luck, to make his escape. But the dangers which\r\nattended his eventful career were not at an end. He was surprised as he\r\nretired to the farm of Portnellan, near the head of Loch Katrine, by his\r\nold enemy, the factor of Montrose, with a party of men, who surrounded\r\nthe house in which Rob Roy slept before he was out of bed; yet, the\r\nmoment that he appeared, sword in hand, they fled in dismay. These, and\r\nmany other incidents, rest so much upon tradition, and are so little\r\nsupported by authority, that they belong rather to romance than to\r\nhistory. It is with the part which Rob Roy took in the actual concerns\r\nof his country that his biographer has most concern.\r\n\r\nThis brave but reckless individual was exactly the man to adopt a\r\ndangerous cause, and to play a desperate game. Proscribed, hunted,\r\nsurrounded by enemies, burning under the consciousness of wrong, and\r\nunable to retrace his path to a peaceable mode of life, Rob Roy was a\r\nready partisan of the Jacobite cause.\r\n\r\nIn 1713, he had transactions with two emissaries of the house of Stuart,\r\nand was called to account for that negotiation before the\r\ncommander-in-chief in Edinburgh. He escaped punishment; and prepared, in\r\n1715, to lead his clans to the field, headed by Macgregor of Glengyle,\r\nhis nephew.[113] Upon Michaelmas day, having made themselves masters of\r\nthe boats in Loch Lomond, seventy of the Macgregors possessed themselves\r\nof Inch-murrain, a large island on the lake. About midnight they went\r\nashore at Bonhill, about three miles above Dumbarton. Meantime the alarm\r\nwas spread over the country; bells were rung, and cannon fired from\r\nDumbarton Castle. The Macgregors, therefore, thought fit to scamper away\r\nto their boats, and to return to the island. Here they indulged\r\nthemselves in their usual marauding practices, \"carrying off deer,\r\nslaughtering cows, and other depredations.\" Soon afterwards they all\r\nhurried away to the Earl of Mar's encampment at Perth; here they did not\r\nlong remain, but returned to Loch Lomond on the tenth of October.[114]\r\n\r\nThey now mustered their forces. Such was the terror of their name, that\r\nboth parties appear to have been afraid of the Macgregors, and to think\r\n\"it would be their wisdom to part peaceably with them, because, if they\r\nshould make any resistance, and shed the blood of so much as one\r\nMacgregiour, they would set no bounds to their fury, but burn and slay\r\nwithout mercy.\" This was the opinion held by some; by others resistance\r\nwas thought the more discreet as well as the more honourable part. A\r\nbody of volunteers was brought from Paisley, and it was resolved, if\r\npossible, to retake the boats captured by the Macgregors, who could now\r\nmake a descent wherever they pleased. A singular spectacle was beheld on\r\nthe bosom of Loch Lomond: four pinnaces and seven boats, which had been\r\ndrawn by the strength of horses up the river Levin, which, next to the\r\nSpey, is the most rapid stream in Scotland, were beheld, their sails\r\nspread, cleaving the dark waters which reflected in their mirror a sight\r\nof armed men, who were marching along the side of the loch, in order to\r\nscour the coast. Never had anything been seen of the kind on Loch Lomond\r\nbefore. \"The men on the shore,\" writes an eyewitness, \"marched with the\r\ngreatest ardour and alacrity. The pinnaces on the water discharging\r\ntheir patararoes, and the men their small arms, made so very dreadful a\r\nnoise thro' the multiply'd rebounding echoes of the vast mountains on\r\nboth sides the loch, that perhaps there never was a more lively\r\nresemblance of thunder.\" This little fleet was joined in the evening by\r\nthe enemy of the Macgregors, Sir Humphrey Colquhoun of Luss, followed by\r\n\"fourty or fifty stately fellows, in their short hose and belted plaids,\r\narmed each of 'em with a well-fixed gun on his shoulder.\" At Luss a\r\nreport prevailed that the Macgregors were reinforced by Macdonald of\r\nGlengarry, and had amounted to fifteen hundred strong: but this proved\r\nto be an idle rumour; their numbers were only four hundred.\r\n\r\nThis falsehood did not dishearten the men of Paisley. \"They knew,\" says\r\nthe chronicler of their feats, \"that the Macgregiours and the devil are\r\nto be dealt with after the same way; and that if they be resisted, they\r\nwill flee.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the party from Paisley went on their\r\nexpedition, and arrived at Inversnaid. Here, in order to \"arouse those\r\nthieves and rebels from their dens,\" they fired a gun through the roof\r\nof a house on the declivity of a mountain; upon which an old woman or\r\ntwo came crawling out, and scrambled up the hill; but no other persons\r\nappeared. \"Whereupon,\" adds the narrator,[115] \"the Paisley men, under\r\nthe command of Captain Finlason, assisted by Captain Scot, a half-pay\r\nofficer, of late a lieutenant of Colonel Kerr's regiment of dragoons,\r\nwho is indeed an officer, wise, stout, and honest; the Dumbarton men,\r\nunder the command of David Colquhoun and James Duncanson, of Garshark,\r\nmagistrates of the burgh, with several of the other companies, to the\r\nnumber of an hundred men in all, with the greatest intrepidity leapt on\r\nshore, got up to the top of the mountain, and drew up in order, and\r\nstood about an hour, their drums beating all the while: but no enemie\r\nappearing, they thereupon went in quest of the boats which the rebels\r\nhad seized; and having casually lighted on some ropes, anchors, and oars\r\nhid among the shrubs, at length they found the boats drawn up a good\r\nway on the land, which they hurled down to the loch. Such of them as\r\nwere not damaged, they carried off with them; and such as were, they\r\nsunk or hewed in pieces. And that same night they return'd to Luss, and\r\nthence next day, without the loss or hurt of so much as one man, to\r\nDumbarton, whence they had first set out altogether, bringing along with\r\nthem the whole boats they found in their way on either side the loch,\r\nand in creeks of the isles, and moored them under the cannon of the\r\ncastle. And thus in a short time, and with little expense, the\r\nM'Greigours were towed, and a way pointed how the Government might\r\neasily keep them in awe.\"\r\n\r\nThe historian remarks, as a good augury, that a violent storm had raged\r\nfor three days before. In the morning, notwithstanding this much\r\nmagnified triumph on the part of his enemies, neither Rob Roy nor his\r\nfollowers were in the least daunted, but went about \"proclaiming the\r\nPretender,\" and carrying off plunder. \"Yesternight,[116] about seven,\"\r\nwrites the same historian, \"we had ane accountt from one of our\r\ntownsmen, who had been five miles in the country, in the paroch of\r\nBaldernock, that three or four hundred of the clans, forerunners of the\r\nbody coming, had at Drummen, near Dunkeld, proclaimed the Pretender; but\r\nno accountt to us from these places, nor from Sterling. Our magistrates\r\nsent fitt men at eight yesternight for information, and can hardly\r\nreturn till afternoon, if they have access to the three garrisons, of\r\nwhich they are I hear ordered to goe to to-day. I hear by report,\r\nwithout sufficient authority, that it's the M'Grigors come with a party,\r\nproclaimed the Pretender, tore the exciseman's book, and went away.\r\n\r\n                                                              H. E.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Leslie, dated the twentieth of January, 1716, it is\r\nstated that the country did not oppose the incursions of Rob Roy, being\r\nmostly in his interest, or indifferent. Emboldened by this passive\r\nconduct, Rob Roy marched to Falkland on the fourth of January, 1716, and\r\ntook possession of the palace for a garrison. He afterwards joined the\r\nEarl of Mar's forces at Perth, yet, whether from indolence or caution,\r\ntook but little share in the signal events of the day. He hovered\r\nsometimes in the Lowlands, uncertain whether to proclaim peace, or to\r\nembark with his Macgregors in the war: some said he declined fighting\r\nunder Lord Mar, from the fear of offending the Duke of Argyle; at all\r\nevents he had the wiliness to make the belligerent powers each conceive\r\nhim as of their respective parties.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Sherriff Muir, Macgregor had the address to make both\r\nthe Jacobites and Hanoverians conceive, that, had he joined them, the\r\nglory of the day would have been secured.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Leslie, who had heard, with dismay, the news of the\r\nburning of Auchterarder and Blackford, were now affrighted by a rumour\r\nthat Rob Roy had a commission to burn Leslie, and all between that place\r\nand Perth. But, whilst the burgesses of Leslie were daily looking for\r\nthis dreaded event, Rob Roy was forced to retreat to Dundee, by the\r\napproach of the King's troops. He left behind him a character of\r\nreckless rapacity, and of a determined will, notwithstanding some\r\ngenerous and humane actions. He was, nevertheless, esteemed to be among\r\nthe fairest and discreetest of the party to whom he was attached,\r\nnotwithstanding his favourite speech, \"that he desired no better\r\nbreakfast than to see a Whig's house burning.\" The people could not,\r\nindeed, trust any man's assurances after the recent and cruel\r\ndevastation at Auchterarder.\r\n\r\nWhen the fortune of the battle was decided, he was heard to say, in\r\nanswer to demands that he should send his forces to the attack, \"If they\r\ncannot do it without me, they cannot do it with me,\" and he immediately\r\nleft the field. Such is the popular account of his conduct on that\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe partizans of Rob Roy have, however, given a very different version\r\nof his conduct. The Duke of Argyle was the patron and friend of\r\nMacgregor; and he could neither, therefore, openly adopt a course which\r\nthe Duke disapproved, nor would he altogether retire from a cause to\r\nwhich he was disposed to be favourable. With the true Gaelic caution Rob\r\nRoy waited to see which side prevailed, and then hastened to avail\r\nhimself of an opportunity of that which had become the darling pursuit\r\nof his existence--plunder.\r\n\r\nHe retired from Sherriff Muir to Falkland, carrying terror wherever he\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following letter, descriptive of his progress affords a curious\r\npicture of the state of that harassed and wretched country:--\r\n\r\n    \"D. B.\r\n\r\n    \"I received yours this evening, but I find you have been quit\r\n    mistaken about our condition. You datt our freedom and libertie from\r\n    the rebels long befor its commencement, and for profe take the\r\n    folowing accompt of what past heir these last ten days. Upon the\r\n    fourth instant Rob Roey, with one hundred and fifty men, com to\r\n    Falkland, and took possession of the place for a garrison, from\r\n    which they came through the countrey side and robs and plunder,\r\n    taking cloaths and victuals, and every thing that maks for them, nor\r\n    to oposs them till this day eight days. The sixth instant there coms\r\n    thirty-two Highland men (I had almost said devils) to Leslie; we saw\r\n    them at Formand Hills and resolved to resist, and so man, wife, and\r\n    child drew out.\r\n\r\n    \"The men went to the east end of the town, and met them in the green\r\n    with drawn swords in the hands, and we askt them what they were for;\r\n    they said they wanted cloaths and money; we answeared they should\r\n    get neither of them heir, at which they stormed and swore terribly,\r\n    and we told them if they were come for mischeif they should have\r\n    thee fill of it; at which ther were some blows. But they seeing us\r\n    so bold, they began to feear that we should fall upon them, and so\r\n    they askt libertie to march through the town, which we granted, but\r\n    withall told them if they went upon the least house in the town,\r\n    ther should never a man go back to Fackland to tell the news, though\r\n    we should die on the spot, and so they marsht through the town and\r\n    got not so much as the rise of a cap. And they were so afraid that\r\n    they did not return, but went down over the Hank Hill, and east to\r\n    the minister's land; and their they faced about and fired twenty\r\n    shots in upon the peple that were looking at them, but, glory to\r\n    God, without doing the least hurt. And so they went off to the\r\n    Formand Hils, and plundred all the could carry or drive, and\r\n    threatned dreadfully they should be avenged on Leslie and burn it.\"\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of plunder was considered by Rob Roy as a far more venial\r\noffence than if he had fought against Lord Mar, or offended Argyle, with\r\nwhom he continued on such convenient terms, that he did not leave Perth\r\nuntil after the arrival of that General. He then retired with the spoils\r\nhe had acquired, and continued for some years in the practice of the\r\nsame marauding incursions which had already proved so troublesome and\r\ndistressing to his neighbours.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent indemnity, or free pardon, the tribe of Macgregor was\r\nspecially excepted; and their leader, Robert Campbell, alias Macgregor,\r\ncommonly called Robert Roy, was attainted.\r\n\r\nThe severities which followed the Rebellion of 1715, drove Rob Roy to a\r\nremote retreat in the Highlands, where he lived in a solitary hut, half\r\ncovered with copsewood, and seated under the brow of a barren mountain.\r\nHere he resided in poverty, and what was worse to his restless spirit,\r\nin idleness. Here he was in frequent dread of pursuit from the agents of\r\nthe law; and several anecdotes are told with what veracity it is\r\ndifficult to judge, of his dexterity in evading justice. Attainted,\r\ndisappointed, aged, and poor, he had one grievous addition to his\r\nsorrows, which it required a cheerful and energetic mind to\r\nsustain,--that of a family devoid of principle.\r\n\r\nAmong the five sons of Macgregor, Coll, James, Robert, Duncan, and\r\nRonald, four were known to be but too worthy of the name given by the\r\nenemies of the Macgregors to the individuals of that tribe--\"devils.\" Of\r\nColl, the eldest, little is ascertained. Robert, or Robbiq, or the\r\nyounger, as the Gaelic word signifies, inherited all the fierceness,\r\nwithout the generosity, of his race. At sixteen years of age, he\r\ndeliberately shot at a man of the name of Maclaren, and wounded him so\r\nseverely that he died. His brothers were implicated in this murder. On\r\ntheir trials, they were charged with being not only murderers, but\r\nnotorious thieves and receivers of stolen goods. Robert was proved to\r\nhave boasted of having drawn the first blood of the Maclarens; and the\r\nbrothers were all accused of having followed this murder by houghing and\r\nkilling forty head of young cattle belonging to a kinsman of the\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\nRobert Roy, the principal party in the crime, did not appear before the\r\nHigh Court of Justiciary, to which he was summoned: he was therefore\r\noutlawed. The other brothers were tried, and the prosecution was\r\nconducted by the celebrated Duncan Forbes, of Culloden. The prisoners\r\nwere acquitted of being accessory to the murder of Maclaren; but the\r\njury were unanimous in thinking that the charge of being reputed thieves\r\nwas made out, and they were ordered to find caution for their good\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nRobert Roy was advised to retire to France: his brother James remained\r\nin Scotland, and took an active part in the Rebellion of 1745; when,\r\nwith the assistance of his cousin Glengyle, he surprised the fort of\r\nInversnaid; he afterwards led to the battle of Preston Pans six\r\ncompanies of his clan. His thigh-bone was broken in that battle; yet he\r\nappeared again at Culloden, and was subsequently attainted.\r\n\r\nThe life of James Macgregor was spared only to present a tissue of\r\nguilty schemes, and to end in infamy and exile. That of Rob Roy was dyed\r\nyet deeper in crimes, of which a second trial and an ignominious death\r\nwere the dreadful result. He was hung in the Grass Market in Edinburgh,\r\nin the year 1754. James, his brother, being reduced to the most\r\nhumiliating condition, died in France, after exhibiting in his conduct,\r\nwhilst in Scotland, if possible, almost a deeper shade of depravity than\r\nthat displayed by his brother.\r\n\r\nTheir father was, however, released from his existence before these\r\ndesperate men had sullied the name which he transmitted to them by their\r\ntransgressions.\r\n\r\nAs he declined in strength, Rob Roy became more peaceable in\r\ndisposition; and his nephew, the head of the clan, renounced the enmity\r\nwhich had subsisted between the Macgregors and the Duke of Montrose. The\r\ntime of this celebrated freebooter's death is uncertain, but is\r\ngenerally supposed to have occurred after the year 1738. \"When he found\r\nhimself approaching his final change,\" says Sir Walter Scott, \"he\r\nexpressed some contrition for particular parts of his life. His wife\r\nlaughed at these scruples of conscience, and exhorted him to die like a\r\nman, as he had lived. In reply, he rebuked her for her violent passions\r\nand the counsels she had given him. \"You have put strife,\" he said,\r\n\"betwixt me and the best men of my country, and now you would place\r\nenmity between me and my God.\"\"\r\n\r\nAlthough he had been educated in the Protestant faith, Rob Roy had\r\nbecome a Catholic long before his death. \"It was a convenient religion,\"\r\nhe used to say, \"which for a little money could put asleep the\r\nconscience, and clear the soul from sin.\" The time and causes of his\r\nconversion are only surmised; but when he had resolved on this\r\nimportant step, the freebooter left his lovely residence in the\r\nHighlands, and repairing to Drummond Castle, in Perthshire, sought an\r\nold Catholic priest, by name Alexander Drummond. His confessions were\r\nstated by himself to have been received by groans from the aged man to\r\nwhom he unburthened his heart, and who frequently crossed himself whilst\r\nlistening to the recital.\r\n\r\nEven after this manifestation of penitence, Rob Roy returned to his old\r\npractices, and accompanying his nephew to the Northern Highlands, he is\r\nstated to have so greatly enriched himself, that he returned to the\r\nBraes of Balquhidder, and began farming.\r\n\r\nHe is said in the decline of life to have visited London, and to have\r\nbeen pointed out to George the Second by the Duke of Argyle, whilst\r\nwalking in the front of St. James's Palace. He still had an imposing and\r\nyouthful appearance, and the King is said to have declared that he had\r\nnever seen a handsomer man in the Highland garb.[117] But this, and\r\nother anecdotes, rest on no better authority than tradition. His\r\nstrength, always prodigious, continued until a very late period; but at\r\nlast it was extinguished even before the spirit which had stimulated it\r\nhad died away. He is acknowledged, even by his partial biographer, to\r\nhave declined one duel, and to have been worsted in another; but\r\nimpaired eyesight, and decayed faculties are pleaded in defence of a\r\nweakness which cast dishonour on Macgregor.\r\n\r\nHis deathbed was in character with his life: when confined to bed, a\r\nperson with whom he was at enmity proposed to visit him. \"Raise me up,\"\r\nsaid Rob Roy to his attendants, \"dress me in my best clothes, tie on my\r\narms, place me in my chair. It shall never be said that Rob Roy\r\nMacgregor was seen defenceless and unarmed by an enemy.\" His wishes were\r\nexecuted; and he received his guest with haughty courtesy. When he had\r\ndeparted, the dying chief exclaimed: \"It is all over now--put me to\r\nbed--call in the piper; let him play '_Ha til mi tulidh_' (we return no\r\nmore) as long as I breathe.\" He was obeyed,--he died, it is said, before\r\nthe dirge was finished. His tempestuous life was closed at the farm of\r\nInverlochlarigbeg, (the scene, afterwards, of his son's frightful\r\ncrimes,) in the Braes of Balquhidder. He died in 1735, and his remains\r\nrepose in the parish churchyard, beneath a stone upon which some admirer\r\nof this extraordinary man has carved a sword. His funeral is said to\r\nhave been attended by all ranks of people, and a deep regret was\r\nexpressed for one whose character had much to recommend it to the regard\r\nof Highlanders.\r\n\r\nHe left behind him the memory of a character by nature singularly noble,\r\nhumane, and honourable, but corrupted by the indulgence of predatory\r\nhabits. That he had ever very deep religious impressions is doubted; and\r\nhis conversion to popery has been conjectured to have succeeded a\r\nwavering and unsettled faith. When dying, he showed that he entertained\r\na sense of the practical part of Christianity, very consistent with his\r\nHighland notions. He was exhorted by the clergyman who attended him to\r\nforgive his enemies; and that clause in the Lord's prayer which enjoins\r\nsuch a state of mind was quoted. Rob Roy replied: \"Ay, now ye hae gien\r\nme baith law and gospel for it. It's a hard law, but I ken it's gospel.\"\r\n\"Rob,\" he said, turning to his son, \"my sword and dirk lie there: never\r\ndraw them without reason, nor put them up without honour. I forgive my\r\nenemies; but see you to them,--or may\"--the words died away, and he\r\nexpired.\r\n\r\nReason may disapprove of such a character as that of Rob Roy, but the\r\nimagination and the feelings are carried away by so much generosity,\r\nsuch dauntless exertion in behalf of the friendless, as were displayed\r\nby the outlawed and attainted freebooter. He was true to his word,\r\nfaithful to his friends, and honourable in the fulfilment of his\r\npecuniary obligations. How many are there, who abide in the sunshine of\r\nthe world's good opinion, who have little claim to similar virtues!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[99] From the Wodrow MS. in the Advocate's Library.\r\n\r\n[100] Macleay's History of the Macgregors, p. 110.\r\n\r\n[101] Historical Memoir of the Clan Macgregor, by Dr. Macleay, p. 109.\r\n\r\n[102] Preface to Rob Roy.

Some have composed\r\naccounts of this singular, depraved, and unfortunate man, with the\r\nevident determination to give to every action the darkest possible\r\ntinge; others have waived all discussion on his demerits by insisting\r\nlargely upon the fame and antiquity of his family. He has himself\r\nbequeathed to posterity an apology for his life, and from his word we\r\nare bound to take so much, but only so much, as may accord with the\r\nstatements of others in mitigation of the heinous facts which blast his\r\nmemory with eternal opprobrium.\r\n\r\nAs far as the researches into the remote antiquity of Scotland may be\r\nrelied upon, it appears that the name of Fraser was amongst the first of\r\nthose which Scotland derived from Normandy, and the origin of this name\r\nhas been referred to the remote age of Charles the Simple. A nobleman of\r\nBourbon--such is the fable,--presented that monarch with a dish of\r\nstrawberries. The loyal subject, who bore the name of Julius De Berry,\r\nwas knighted on the spot, and the sirname of Fraize was given him in\r\nlieu of that which he had borne. Hence the ancient armorial bearing of\r\nthe Frasers, a field azure, seme with strawberries: and hence the\r\nwidely-spreading connection of the Frasers with the noble family of\r\nFrezeau, or Frezel, in France, a race connected with many of the royal\r\nfamilies in Europe. For a considerable period after the elevation of\r\nJulius de Berry, the name was written Frezeau, or Frisil.\r\n\r\nThe period at which the Frasers left Normandy for Scotland has been\r\nassigned to the days of Malcolm Canmore, where John, the eldest of three\r\nbrothers of the house, founded the fortunes of the Frasers of Oliver\r\nCastle in Tweedale, by marrying Eupheme Sloan, heiress of Tweedale:\r\nwhilst another brother settled beyond the Forth, and became possessed of\r\nthe lands of Inverkeithing. Eventually those members of this Norman race\r\nwho had at first settled in Tweedale, branched off to Aberdeenshire, and\r\nto Inverness-shire;[118] and it was in this latter county, at Beaufort,\r\na property which had been long held by his family, that the famous Lord\r\nLovat was born.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account generally received. According to others, the family\r\nof Fraser is of Scandinavian origin. When the Scandinavians invaded the\r\neastern coast of Britain, and the northern coast of France, one branch\r\nof the family of Frizell, or Fryzell, settled in Scotland; another in\r\nNormandy, where the name has retained its original pronunciation.[119]\r\n\r\nThe castle of Beaufort, anciently a royal fortress, had been bestowed\r\nupon the Frasers, in the year 1367. It is situated in the beautiful\r\nneighbourhood of Inverness, in the district of the Aird; it was besieged\r\nby the army of Edward the First during the invasion of Scotland by the\r\nusual method of throwing stones from catapultae, at a distance of seven\r\nhundred yards. A subsidiary fortress, Lovat, heretofore inhabited by one\r\nof the constables of the Crown, whom the lawlessness of the wild\r\ninhabitants and the turbulence of their chieftains had rendered it\r\nnecessary to establish in the west of Scotland, also fell into the\r\npossession of the Frasers.\r\n\r\nThe present seat of the family of Lovat, still called Beaufort, is built\r\non a part of the ground originally occupied by a fortress. It lies on a\r\nbeautiful eminence near the Beauly, and is surrounded by extensive\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nThe race, thus engrafted upon a Scottish stock, continued to acquire\r\nfrom time to time fresh honours. It was distinguished by bravery and\r\nfidelity. When Edward the First determined to subdue Scotland, he found\r\nthree Powers refuse to acknowledge his pretensions. These were, Sir\r\nWilliam Wallace, Sir Simon Fraser, commonly called the Patriot, and the\r\ngarrison of Stirling. When Bruce, with an inconsiderable force fought\r\nthe English army at Methven, near Perth, and was thrice dismounted, Sir\r\nSimon Fraser thrice replaced him on his saddle; he was himself taken\r\nprisoner and ordered to be executed. And then might be witnessed one of\r\nthose romantic instances of Highland devotion, which appear almost\r\nincredible to the calmer notions of a modern era. A rumour went abroad\r\nthat the stay of the country, the gallant Fraser, was to suffer for his\r\nfidelity to his country's interests. Herbert de Norham, one of his\r\nfollowers, and Thomas de Boys, his armour-bearer, swore, that if the\r\nreport were true, they would not survive their master. They died\r\nvoluntarily on the day of his execution.\r\n\r\nIn 1431, the Frasers were ennobled; the head of the house was created a\r\nLord of Parliament by James the First, and the title was preserved in\r\nregular succession, until, by the death of Hugh, the eleventh Lord\r\nLovat, it reverted, together with all the family estates, now of\r\nconsiderable value and extent, to Thomas Fraser, of Beaufort, great\r\nuncle of the last nobleman. This destination of the property and honours\r\nwas settled by a deed, executed by Hugh, Lord Lovat, in order to\r\npreserve the male succession in the family. It was the cause of endless\r\nheart-burnings and feuds. Hugh had married the Lady Emelia Murray,\r\ndaughter of John, Marquis of Athole, and had daughters by that\r\nmarriage. He had, in the first instance, settled upon the eldest of them\r\nthe succession, on condition of her marrying a gentleman of the name of\r\nFraser. But this arrangement agreed ill with the Highland pride; and\r\nupon a plea of his having been prevailed on to give this bond, contrary\r\nto the old rights and investments of the family, he being of an easy\r\ntemper, having been imposed on to grant this bond, he set it aside by a\r\nsubsequent will in favour of his great uncle, dated March 26th,\r\n1696.[120]\r\n\r\nThe families of Murray and Fraser were, at the time that the title of\r\nLovat descended upon Thomas Fraser, united in what outwardly appeared to\r\nbe an alliance of friendship. Their politics, indeed, at times differed.\r\nThe late Lord Lovat had persisted in his adherence to James the Second\r\nof England after his abdication, and had marshalled his own troops under\r\nthe banners of the brave Dundee. The Marquis of Athole, then Lord\r\nTullibardine, on the other hand, had adopted the principles of the\r\nRevolution, and had received a commission of Colonel from William the\r\nThird, to raise a regiment of infantry for the reigning monarch.[121]\r\nThus were the seeds of estrangement between these families, so nearly\r\nunited in blood, sown; and they were aggravated by private and jarring\r\ninterests, and by manoeuvres and intrigues, of which Lord Lovat, who has\r\nleft a recital of them, was, from his own innate taste for cabals, and\r\naptitude to dissimulation, calculated to be an incomparable judge.\r\n\r\nOf the character of Thomas of Beaufort, the father of Simon, little idea\r\ncan be formed, except that he seems to have been chiefly guided by the\r\nsubtle spirit of his son Simon. The loss of an elder son, Alexander,\r\nafter whose death Simon was considered as the acknowledged heir of the\r\nFrasers, may have increased the influence which a young, ardent temper\r\nnaturally exercises over a parent advanced in years. Of his father,\r\nSimon, in his various memoirs and letters, always speaks with respect;\r\nand he refers with pride and pleasure to his mother's lineage.\r\n\r\n\"His mother,\" he remarks, writing in the third person, \"was Dame Sybilla\r\nMacleod, daughter of the chief of the clan of the Macleods, so famous\r\nfor its inviolable loyalty to its princes.\"[122]\r\n\r\nDuring his life-time his great nephew, Thomas Fraser of Beaufort, had\r\nborne the title of Laird of Beaufort. \"He now took possession,\" says his\r\nbiographer, \"without opposition, of the honours and titles which had\r\ndescended to him, and enjoyed them until his death.\" According to other\r\nauthorities, however, Thomas Fraser never assumed the rank of a\r\nnobleman, but retired to the Isle of Sky, where he died in 1699, three\r\nyears after his accession to the disputed honours and estates.\r\n\r\nThe family of Thomas of Beaufort was numerous. Of fourteen children, six\r\ndied in infancy; of the eight who survived, Simon Fraser only mentions\r\ntwo,--his elder brother, Alexander, and his younger, John. Alexander,\r\nwho died in 1692, was of a violent and daring temper. A determined\r\nadherent of James the Second, he joined Viscount Dundee in 1689, when\r\nthe standard was raised in favour of the abdicated monarch. During a\r\nfuneral which had assembled at Beauly, near Inverness, Alexander\r\nreceived some affront, which, in a fit of passion, he avenged. He killed\r\nhis antagonist, and instantly fled to Wales, in order to escape the\r\neffects of his crime. He died in Wales, without issue. John became a\r\nbrigadier in the Dutch service, and was known by the name of Le\r\nChevalier Fraser. He died in 1716, \"when,\" says his brother, Lord Lovat,\r\nin his Memoirs, \"I lost my only brother, a fine young fellow.\"[123]\r\n\r\nSimon Fraser, afterwards Lord Lovat, was born at Inverness,--according\r\nto some accounts in 1668, to others in 1670: he fixes the date himself\r\nat 1676. He was educated at the University of Aberdeen, where he\r\ndistinguished himself, and took the degree of Master of Arts. During his\r\nboyhood he shewed his hereditary affection to the Stuarts,--an affection\r\nwhich was probably sincere at that early age: and he was even\r\nimprisoned for his open avowal of that cause, at the time when his elder\r\nbrother repaired to the standard of Dundee. Deserting the study of the\r\ncivil law, to which he had been originally destined, Simon Fraser\r\nentered a company in the regiment of Lord Tullibardine, his relation;\r\nnevertheless, he twice attempted to benefit the Jacobite cause,--once,\r\nby joining the insurrection promoted by General Buchan, and a second\r\ntime by forming a plan, which was rendered abortive by the famous\r\nvictory at La Hogue, for surprising the Castle of Edinburgh, and\r\nproclaiming King James in that capital.\r\n\r\nThis plot escaped detection; and the young soldier pursued his military\r\nduties, until the death of Hugh Lord Lovat drew him from the routine of\r\nhis daily life into intrigues which better suited his restless and\r\ndauntless character.\r\n\r\nAlthough his father, it is clearly understood, never bore the title of\r\nLord Lovat, Simon, immediately upon the death of Lord Hugh, took upon\r\nhimself the dignity and the offices of Master of Lovat. He seems,\r\nindeed, to have assumed all the importance, and to have exercised all\r\nthe authority, which properly belonged to Lord Lovat. He was at this\r\ntime nearly thirty years of age, and he had passed his life, not in mere\r\namusement, but in acquiring a knowledge of the world in prosecuting his\r\nown interests. It is true, his leisure hours might have been more\r\ninnocently bestowed even in the most desultory pursuits, than in the\r\ndebasing schemes and scandalous society in which his existence was\r\npassed: it is true, that in studying his own interests, he forgot his\r\ntrue interest, and failed lamentably; still, he had not been idle in his\r\nvocation.\r\n\r\nHe is said, on tradition, to have been one of the most frightful men\r\never seen; and the portrait which Hogarth took of him, corroborates that\r\nreport. He inherited the courage natural to his family, and his\r\ncharacter, in that single respect, shone out at the last with a radiancy\r\nthat one almost regrets, since it seemed so inconsistent that a career\r\nof the blackest vice and perfidy should close with something little less\r\nthan dignity of virtue. He seems to have been endowed with a capacity\r\nworthy of a better employment than waiting upon a noble and wealthy\r\nrelative, or inflaming discords between Highland clans. If we may adduce\r\nthe Latin quotations which Lovat parades in his Memoirs, and which he\r\nuttered during his last hours, we must allow him to have cultivated the\r\nclassics. His letters are skilful, even masterly, cajoling, yet\r\ncharacteristic. It is affirmed that in spite of a physiognomy vulgar in\r\nfeature, and coarse and malignant in expression, he could, like Richard\r\nof Gloucester, obliterate the impression produced by his countenance,\r\nand charm those whom it was his interest to please. His effrontery was\r\nunconquerable: whilst conscious of the most venal motives, and even\r\nafter he had displayed to the world a shameless tergiversation, he had\r\nthe assurance always to claim for himself the merit of patriotism. \"For\r\nmy part,\" he said on one occasion, in conversation with his friends, \"I\r\ndie a martyr to my country.\"[124]\r\n\r\nIn after life, Lovat is described by a contemporary writer, \"to have had\r\na fine comely head to grace Temple Bar.\" He was a man of lofty stature,\r\nand large proportion; and in the later portion of his life, he grew so\r\ncorpulent, that \"I imagined,\" says the same writer, \"the doors of the\r\nTower must be altered to get him in.\"[125]\r\n\r\n\"Lord Lovat,\" says another writer, \"makes an odd figure, being generally\r\nmore loaded with clothes than a Dutchman: he is tall, walks very\r\nupright, considering his great age, and is tolerably well shaped; he has\r\na large mouth and short nose, with eyes very much contracted and\r\ndown-looking; a very small forehead, covered with a large periwig,--this\r\ngives him a grim aspect, but on addressing any one, he puts on a smiling\r\ncountenance: he is near-sighted, and affects to be much more so than he\r\nreally is.\"\r\n\r\n\"His natural abilities,\" remarks the editor of the Culloden Papers,\r\n\"were excellent, and his address, accomplishments, and learning far\r\nabove the usual lot of his countrymen, even of equal rank. With the\r\ncivilized, he was the modern perfect fine gentleman; and in the North,\r\namong his people, the feudal baron of the tenth century.\"[126]\r\n\r\nIt seems absurd to talk of the religious principles of a man who\r\nviolated every principle which religion inculcates; yet the mind is\r\nnaturally curious to know whether any bonds of faith, or suggestion of\r\nconscience ever checked, even for an instant, the career of this base,\r\nunprincipled man. After much deception, much shuffling, and perhaps much\r\nself-delusion, Lord Lovat was, by his own declaration, a Roman Catholic:\r\nhis sincerity, even in this avowal, has been questioned. In politics, he\r\nwas in heart (if he had a heart) a Jacobite; and yet, on his trial, he\r\ninsisted strongly upon his affection for the reigning family.\r\n\r\nSuch were the characteristics of Simon Fraser, when, by the death of\r\nHugh Lord Lovat, his father and himself were raised from the\r\nsubservience of clansmen to the dignity of chieftains. To these traits\r\nmay be added a virtue rare in those days, and, until a long time\r\nafterwards, rare in Highland districts;--he was temperate: when others\r\nlost themselves by excesses, he preserved the superiority of sobriety;\r\nand perhaps his crafty character, his never-ending designs, his\r\nremorseless selfishness, were rendered more fatal and potent by this\r\nsingular feature in his deportment. There was another circumstance, less\r\nrare in his country, the advantage of an admirable constitution. It was\r\nthis, coupled with his original want of feeling, which sustained him in\r\nthe imprisonment in the Tower, and enabled him to display, at eighty,\r\nthe elasticity of youth. Lord Lovat was never known to have had the\r\nheadache, and to the hour of his death he read without spectacles. A\r\nvery short time after the death of Hugh Lord Lovat elapsed, before those\r\nrelatives to whom he had bequeathed his estates were involved in the\r\ndeadliest quarrel with the family of Lord Tullibardine.\r\n\r\nThe family of Lord Tullibardine, at that time called Lord Murray,\r\nfurnish one of those numerous instances which occur in the reign of\r\nWilliam the Third, of an open avowal of Whig principles, joined to a\r\nsecret inclination to favour the Jacobite party. The Marquis of Athole,\r\nthe father of Lord Tullibardine, had been a powerful Royalist in the\r\ntime of Charles the First; but had, nevertheless, promoted the\r\nRevolution, and had hastened, in 1689, to court the favour of the Prince\r\nof Orange, with whom his lady claimed kindred.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in his hopes of distinction, the Marquis returned to his\r\nformer views upon the subject of legitimacy; and finally retired into\r\nprivate life, leaving the pursuit of fortune to his son, Lord John,\r\nafterwards Earl Tullibardine, and Marquis of Athole. The disgust of the\r\nold Marquis towards the government of William the Third, and the evident\r\ndetermination which his son soon manifested to ingratiate himself with\r\nthat monarch, had, at the time when the death of Hugh Lord Lovat took\r\nplace, completely alienated the Marquis from his son, and produced an\r\nentire separation of their interests.[127]\r\n\r\nIn his zeal for the King's service, Lord Tullibardine had endeavoured to\r\nraise a regiment of infantry; and it happened, that at this time Simon\r\nFraser, as he expresses it, \"by a most extraordinary stroke of\r\nProvidence, held a commission in that regiment.\" This commission had\r\nbeen procured for him by his cousin, Lord Lovat, who looked upon it as\r\nthe best means of \"bringing him out in the world,\" as he expressed\r\nhimself. The mode in which Simon was induced by Lord Murray to accept of\r\nthis commission, and the manner in which he was, according to his own\r\nstatement, induced to support a scheme which was adverse to the\r\ninterests of King James, is narrated in his own Memoirs. If we may\r\nbelieve his account, he opposed the formation of this regiment by every\r\nexertion in his power: he aided the Stewarts and Robinsons of Athole,\r\ndevoted Jacobites, and determined opposers of Lord Murray, whose claims\r\non them as their chieftain they refused to admit; and when Lord Murray,\r\non being appointed one of the Secretaries of State, resolved to give up\r\nthe colonelcy of the troop, he tried every means in his power to\r\ndissuade his cousin, Hugh Lord Lovat, to whom it was offered, from\r\naccepting the honour which it was inconsistent with his principles to\r\nbear. This conduct, according to the hero of the tale, was highly\r\napplauded by the old Marquis of Athole, who even engaged his young\r\nrelative, Simon, to pass the winter in the city of Perth with the\r\nyounger son of the Marquis, Lord Mungo Murray, in order that they might\r\nthere prosecute together the study of mathematics.\r\n\r\nSimon accepted the invitation; and whilst he was at Perth, he was,\r\naccording to his own statement, cajoled by Lord Murray into accepting\r\nthe commission, which \"he held by a stroke of Providence;\" and which was\r\nrepresented by Lord Murray, as Simon affirms, to be actually a regiment\r\nintended for the service of King James, who, it was expected, would make\r\na descent into Scotland in the following summer. And it was observed\r\nthat since the Laird of Beaufort was so zealous in his service, he could\r\nnot do his Majesty a greater benefit than in accepting this commission.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by these declarations, Simon had not only accepted the\r\ncommission, but had used his influence to make up a complete company\r\nfrom his own clan: nevertheless, the command of the company was long\r\ndelayed. His pride as a Highlander and a soldier was aggrieved by being\r\nobliged to sit down content, for some time, as a lieutenant of\r\ngrenadiers; and, at last, the company was only given upon the payment of\r\na sum of money to the captain, who made room for the Laird of Beaufort.\r\nNor was this all; for upon the Lord Murray being made one of the\r\nSecretaries of State, he insisted upon the regiment taking oath of\r\nabjuration, which had never before been tendered to the Scottish\r\narmy.[128]\r\n\r\nSuch had been the state of affairs when Hugh Lord Lovat was taken ill,\r\nand died at Perth. The manner in which Simon Fraser represents this\r\nevent, is far more characteristic of his own malignant temper, than\r\nderogating to the family upon whom he wreaks all the luxury of vengeance\r\nthat words could give. Simon, it appears, had persuaded Lord Lovat to\r\ngo to Dunkeld, to meet his wife, the daughter of the Marquis of Athole,\r\nin order to conduct her to Lovat. Lord Lovat, disgusted by the treachery\r\nof the Earl of Tullibardine in respect to the regiment, had refused to\r\nhave anything more to do with \"this savage family of Athole,\" as he\r\ncalled them, \"who would certainly kill him.\"[129] According to an\r\naccount more to be relied on than that of the scheming and perfidious\r\nSimon, the aversion which Lord Lovat imbibed during his latter days to\r\nhis wife's kindred, was implanted in his mind by Simon Fraser, in order\r\nto gain his weak-minded relative over to that plot which he had formed\r\nin order to secure the estates of Lovat to his own branch of the\r\nhouse.[130] This, however, is the account given by Fraser of his\r\nkinsman's last illness:--\r\n\r\n\"In reality he had been only two days at Dunkeld, when he fell sick, and\r\nthe Atholes, not willing to be troubled with the care of an invalid, or\r\nfor some other reasons, sent him to an inn in the city of Perth, hard by\r\nthe house of Dr. James Murray, a physician, the relation or creature of\r\nthe Marquis of Athole, upon whom the care of Lord Lovat's person was\r\ndevolved.\r\n\r\n\"The moment the Laird of Beaufort heard the news that Lord Lovat had\r\nbeen conducted, very ill, to the town of Perth, he set out to his\r\nassistance. But before his arrival, in consequence of the violent\r\nremedies that had been administered to him, he lost the use of his\r\nreason, and lay in his bed in a manner incapable of motion,--abandoned\r\nby his wife and the whole family of Athole, who waited for his\r\ndissolution in great tranquillity, at the house of Dr. Murray, their\r\nrelation.\"\r\n\r\nLord Lovat, however, recollected his cousin, and embracing him said,\r\n\"Did not I tell you, my dear Simon, that these devils would certainly\r\nkill me? See in what a condition I am!\" Simon could not refrain from\r\ntears at this melancholy spectacle. He threw himself on the bed beside\r\nLord Lovat, and did not quit him till he died the next morning in his\r\narms. Meanwhile, not an individual of the Athole family entered his\r\napartment after having once seen him in the desperate condition in which\r\nhe had been found by the Laird of Beaufort.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of family discord when Lord Lovat died; and it was\r\ndiscovered, to the consternation of the Marquis of Athole and his sons,\r\nthat he had made a will in favour of his relation Thomas of Beaufort,\r\nand to the exclusion of his own daughter.\r\n\r\nThe right of Thomas of Beaufort was deemed incontestable; and not a man,\r\nit was presumed, dreamed of disputing it. Yet it was soon obvious that\r\nthe Earl of Tullibardine, who had now acquired the title of Viceroy of\r\nScotland, was determined to support a claim in behalf of the daughter of\r\nLord Lovat, and to have her declared heiress to her father. This scheme\r\nwas coupled with a design of marrying the young lady also to one of Lord\r\nTullibardine's own sons,[131] of whom he had five, and, according to\r\nSimon Fraser, without fortune to bestow on any of his children.\r\n\r\nThe Master of Lovat, Simon Fraser, as he rightfully was now,\r\ncommunicated this scheme to his father, and entreated him to resist this\r\nclaim. Recourse was had to several of the most able lawyers of the\r\nkingdom, and their opinion unanimously was, that Lord Tullibardine had\r\nno more right to make his \"niece heiress of Lovat than to put her in\r\npossession of the throne of Scotland: that the right of Thomas of\r\nBeaufort to those honours and estates was incontrovertible, and that the\r\nKing himself would not deprive him of them, except for high treason.\" It\r\nappears that Lord Tullibardine was satisfied of the justice of the\r\nopinion as far as the title was concerned, but he still considered that\r\nthe property of the last Lord Lovat ought to descend to his daughter and\r\nheiress. The point was warmly viewed between the Earl and the Master of\r\nLovat; but the conference ended with no farther satisfaction to either\r\nof the gentlemen than that of having each a full opportunity of reviling\r\nthe other: such, at least, is the account given by one of the parties;\r\nno reasonable person will venture wholly to vouch for its accuracy, yet\r\nthe dialogue does not appear improbable. This firmness and spirit threw\r\nthe Lord Commissioner into a violent passion; he exclaimed in a furious\r\ntone, \"I have always known you for an obstinate, insolent rascal; I\r\ndon't know what should hinder me from cutting off your ears, or from\r\nthrowing you into a dungeon, and bringing you to the gallows, as your\r\ntreasons against the Government so richly deserve.\" Simon, having never\r\nbefore been accustomed to such language, immediately stuck his hat on\r\nhis head, and laying his hand upon the hilt of his sword, was upon the\r\npoint of drawing it, when he observed that Lord Tullibardine had no\r\nsword: upon this he addressed him in the following manner.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what hinders me, knave and coward as you are, from\r\nrunning my sword through your body. You are well known for a poltroon,\r\nand if you had one grain of courage, you would never have chosen your\r\nground in the midst of your guards, to insult a gentleman of a better\r\nhouse, and of a more honourable birth than your own; but I shall one day\r\nhave my revenge. As for the paltry company that I hold in your regiment,\r\nand which I have bought dearer than ever any company was bought\r\nbefore,--it is the greatest disgrace to which I was ever subject, to be\r\na moment under your command; and now, if you please, you may give it to\r\nyour footman.\"[132]\r\n\r\nSuch was the beginning of a long course of hostilities which were\r\nthenceforth carried on between the Murrays and the clan of Fraser, and\r\nwhich was productive of the deepest crimes on the part of the Master of\r\nLovat. That he was fully prepared to enter into any schemes, however\r\ndesperate, to ensure the succession of the estates of Lovat, cannot be\r\ndoubted. He prosecuted his designs without remorse or shame. The matter\r\nof surprise must be, that he found partisans and followers willing to\r\naid him in crime, and that he possessed an influence over his followers\r\nlittle short, on their part, of infatuation.\r\n\r\nThe first suggestion that occurred to the mind of this bold and reckless\r\nman was, perhaps, a natural and certainly an innocent method of securing\r\ntranquillity to the enjoyment of his inheritance. He resolved to engage\r\nthe affections of the young daughter of the late Lord Lovat, and, by an\r\nunion with that lady, to satisfy himself that no doubt could arise as to\r\nhis title to the estates, nor with regard to any children whom he might\r\nhave in that marriage; nor was the hand of the Master of Lovat, if we\r\nput aside the important point of character, a proffer to be despised.\r\nThe estate of Beaufort had long been in the possession of his father, as\r\nan appanage of a younger son; and had only been lent as a residence to\r\nHugh Lord Lovat, on account of the ruinous state of the castle of Lovat.\r\nDownie Castle, another important fortress, also accrued to the father of\r\nSimon Lovat; and the estate of Lovat itself was one of the finest and\r\nbest situated in Scotland.[133] In addition to these, the family owned\r\nthe large domain of Sthratheric, which stretches along the western banks\r\nof the Ness, and comprises almost the whole circumference of that\r\nextensive and beautiful lake. The pretensions of the Master were,\r\ntherefore, by no means contemptible; and as he was young, although,\r\naccording to dates, ten years older than he states himself to be, in his\r\nMemoir of his life, he had every reason to augur success.\r\n\r\nFor a time, this scheme seemed to prosper. The young lady, Amelia\r\nFraser, was not averse to receive the Master of Lovat as her suitor; and\r\nthe intermediate party, Fraser, of Tenechiel, who acted as interpreter\r\nto the wishes of the Master, actually succeeded in persuading the young\r\ncreature to elope with him, and to fix the very day of her marriage with\r\nthe Master, to whom Fraser promised to conduct her. But either she\r\nrepented of this clandestine step, or Fraser of Tenechiel, dreading the\r\npower of the Athole family, drew back; for he reconducted her back to\r\nher mother at Castle Downie, even after her assurance had been given\r\nthat she would marry her cousin.[134]\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of this elopement are obscurely stated by Lord Lovat\r\nin his account of the affair; and he does not refer to the treachery or\r\nremorse of his emissary Fraser of Tenechiel, nor does he dwell upon a\r\ndisappointment which must have gratified his mortal enemies of the house\r\nof Athole. Yet it appears, from the long and early intimacy to which he\r\nalludes as having subsisted between himself and the Dowager Lady Lovat,\r\nthat he may have had many opportunities of gaining the regard of the\r\nyoung daughter of that lady,--an idea which accounts, in some measure,\r\nfor her readiness to engage in the scheme of the elopement. At all\r\nevents, he expresses his rage and contempt, and makes no secret of his\r\ndetermined revenge on those who had, as he conceived, frustrated his\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nThe young lady was at first placed under the protection of her mother\r\nat Castle Downie, the chief residence of the clan Fraser; but there it\r\nwas not thought prudent to allow her to abide, and she was therefore\r\ncarried, under an escort, to Dunkeld, the house of her uncle, the\r\nMarquis of Athole. And here another match was very soon provided for\r\nher, and again her consent was gained, and again the preliminaries of\r\nmarriage were arranged for this passive individual. The nobleman whom\r\nher relations now proposed to her was William, afterwards eleventh Lord\r\nSalton, also a Fraser, whose father was a man of great wealth and\r\ninfluence, although referred to by the Master of Lovat as the\r\n\"representative of an unconsiderable branch of the Frasers who had\r\nsettled in the lowlands of the county of Aberdeen.\"[135] This match was\r\nsuggested to the Athole family by one Robert Fraser \"an apostate\r\nwretch,\" as the Master of Lovat calls him, a kinsman, and an advocate;\r\nand he advised the Marquis of Athole, not only to marry the young lady\r\nto the heir of Lord Salton, but also, by various schemes and manoeuvres,\r\nto get Lord Salton declared head of the clan of Frasers. This plot was\r\nsoon divulged; disappointment, rage, revenge were raised to the height\r\nin the breast of the Master of Lovat. His pride was as prominent a\r\nfeature in this bold and vindictive man, as his duplicity. Throughout\r\nlife, he could, it is true, bend for a purpose, as low as his designs\r\nrequired him to bend; but the fierce exclusiveness of a Highland\r\nchieftain never died away, but rankled in his heart to the last.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that he had just cause of irritation against the\r\nMurrays, first for disputing the claim of his father to the Lovat title\r\nand estates, a claim indisputably just; nor was their project for\r\nconstituting Lord Salton the head of the clan Fraser, either a wise or\r\nan equitable scheme. It was heard with loud indignation in that part of\r\nthe country where the original stock of this time-honoured race were,\r\nuntil their name was stained by the crimes of Simon Fraser, held in love\r\nand reverence. It was heard by the Master of Lovat perhaps with less\r\nexpression of his feelings than by his followers; but the meditated\r\naffront was avenged, and avenged by a scheme which none but a demon\r\ncould have devised. It was avenged; but it brought ruin on the head of\r\nthe avenger.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in no other country, at the same period, could the wrongs of an\r\nindividual have been visited upon an aggressor with the same dispatch\r\nand ruthless determination as in the Highlands. Until the year 1748,\r\nwhen the spirit of clanship was broken, never to be restored, those\r\n\"hereditary monarchies founded on custom, and allowed by general consent\r\nrather than established by laws,\"[136] existed in their full vigour. The\r\nmilitary ranks of the clans was fixed and continual during the rare\r\nintervals of local quiet, and every head of a family was captain of his\r\nown tribe.[137] The spirit of rivalry between the clans kept up a taste\r\nfor hostility, and converted rapine into a service of honour. Revenge\r\nwas considered as a duty, and superstition aided the dictates of a\r\nfiery and impetuous spirit. A people naturally humane, naturally\r\nforbearing, had thus, by the habits of ages immemorial, become\r\nremorseless plunderers and resolute avengers. When any affront was\r\noffered to a chieftain, the clan was instantly summoned. They came from\r\ntheir straths and their secluded valleys, wherein there was little\r\nintercourse with society in general to tame their native pride, or to\r\nweaken the predominant emotion of their hearts,--their pride in their\r\nchieftain. They came fearlessly, trusting, not only in the barriers\r\nwhich Nature had given them in their rocks and fastnesses, but in the\r\nunanimity of their purpose. Each clan had its stated place of meeting,\r\nand when it was summoned upon any emergency, the fiery cross, one end\r\nburning, the other wrapt in a piece of linen stained with blood, was\r\nsent among the aroused clansmen, traversing those wild moors, and\r\npenetrating into the secluded glens of those sublime regions. It was\r\nsent, by two messengers, throughout the country, and passed from hand to\r\nhand, these messengers shouting, as they went, the war-cry of the clan,\r\nwhich was echoed from rock to rock. And then arose the cry of the\r\ncoronach, that wail, appropriate to the dead, but uttered also by women,\r\nas the fiery cross roused them from their peaceful occupations, and\r\nhurried from them their sons and their husbands.\r\n\r\nNever was the fiery cross borne throughout the beautiful country of\r\nInvernessshire, never was the wail of the coronach heard on a more\r\nignoble occasion, than on the summons of the Master of Lovat, in the\r\nSeptember of the year 1698. After some fruitless negotiation, it is\r\ntrue, with Lord Salton, and after availing himself of the power of his\r\nfather, as chieftain, to imprison Robert Fraser, and several other\r\ndisaffected clansmen whom that person had seduced from their allegiance,\r\nthe Master of Lovat prepared for action. The traitors to his cause had\r\nescaped death by flight, but the clan were otherwise perfectly faithful\r\nto their chieftain. Fear, as well as love, had a part in their\r\nallegiance; yet it has been conjectured that the hereditary devotion of\r\nthe Highlanders must, originally, have had its origin in gratitude for\r\nservices and for bounty, which it was the interest of every chieftain to\r\nbestow.\r\n\r\nThe Master of Lovat, or, as he was called by his people, the chieftain,\r\nfirst assembled his people at their accustomed place, to the number of\r\nsixty and seventy, and bade them be in readiness when called upon. He\r\nthanked them for their prompt attendance, and then dismissed them.\r\nDuring the next month, however, he was met, coming from Inverness, by\r\nLord Salton and Lord Mungo Murray, who were returning from Castle\r\nDownie. Such was the preparation for the disgraceful scenes which\r\nquickly followed. As soon as the Master of Lovat and his father were\r\ninformed of the flight of their treacherous clansmen, they wrote a\r\nletter to Lord Salton, and conjured him, in the name of the clan, to\r\nremain at home, and not to disturb their repose nor to interfere with\r\nthe interests of their chief; and they assured him, that though a\r\nFraser, he should, if he entered their country, pay for that act of\r\naudacity by his head. Such is Lord Lovat's account: it is not borne out\r\nby the statements of others; yet since the affair must have been\r\ngenerally discussed among the clan, it is probable, that he would not\r\nhave given this version of it without foundation. Lord Salton, according\r\nto the same statement, at first received this letter in good part; and\r\nwrote to Lord Lovat and to the Master, giving his word that he would\r\nonly interfere to make peace; and that, for this reason, he would\r\nproceed to the seat of the Dowager Lady Lovat, at Beaufort.[138] Upon\r\nafterwards discovering that this courtesy was a mere feint, and that\r\nthis new claimant to the honours of chief was in close correspondence\r\nwith the Murrays, who were with him and the Dowager at Beaufort, the\r\nMaster of Lovat wrote to his father, who was at Sthratheric, to meet him\r\nat Lovat, which was only three miles' distance from Beaufort, whilst he\r\nshould himself proceed to the same place by way of Inverness, where he\r\ntrusted that Lord Salton would grant him an interview for the purpose of\r\nexplaining their mutual differences.[139]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Master arrived at Inverness, than he found, as he\r\ndeclares, so much reason to distrust the assurances of Lord Salton, that\r\nhe wrote him a letter, sent, as he says, \"with all diligence by a\r\ngentleman of his train, to adhere to his word passed to his father and\r\nhimself, and to meet him the next day at two in the afternoon, three\r\nmiles from Beaufort, either like a friend, or with sword and pistol, as\r\nhe pleased.\"[140]\r\n\r\nSuch is the account transmitted by Lord Lovat, and intended to give the\r\nair of an \"affair of honour\" to a desperate and lawless attack upon\r\nFraser of Salton, and on those friends who supported his pretensions to\r\nthe hand of the heiress of Lovat.\r\n\r\nThe real facts of the case were, that Fraser of Salton was to pass\r\nthrough Inverness on his way to Dunkeld, where the espousals between him\r\nand the heiress of Lovat were to be celebrated. Whether Simon Fraser\r\npurposed merely to prevent the accomplishment of this marriage, or\r\nwhether he had fully matured another scheme:--whether he was incited by\r\ndisappointment to rush into unpremeditated deeds of violence, or whether\r\nhis design had been fostered in the recesses of his own dark mind,\r\ncannot be fully ascertained. In some measure his revenge was gratified.\r\nHe was enabled, by the events which followed, to delay the marriage of\r\nFraser of Salton, and to retard the nuptials,--which, indeed, never took\r\nplace. \"This wild enterprise,\" observes Arnot, in his Collection of\r\nCriminal Trials in Scotland, \"was to be accomplished by such deeds, that\r\nthe stern contriver of the principal action is less shocking than the\r\nabject submission of his accomplices.\"[141]\r\n\r\nLord Salton dispatched an answer, saying, that he would meet the Master\r\nof Lovat at the appointed time, as his \"good friend and servant.\" But\r\nthe bearer of that message distrusted the reply, and informed the Master\r\nthat he believed it was Fraser of Salton's intention to set out and to\r\npass through Inverness early in the morning, in order to escape the\r\ninterview. Measures were taken accordingly, by the Master of Lovat. At a\r\nvery early hour he was seen passing over the bridge of Inverness,\r\nattended by six gentlemen, as he himself relates, and two servants,\r\ncompletely armed. This is the Master's statement; but on his subsequent\r\ntrial, it appeared that the fiery cross and the coronach had been sent\r\nthroughout all the country; that a body of four or five hundred men in\r\narms were in attendance, and that they had met in the house of one of\r\nthe clansmen, Fraser of Strichen, where the Master took their oaths of\r\nfidelity, and where they swore on their dirks to be faithful to him in\r\nhis enterprise.[142] \"The inhabitants of Inverness,\" says Lord Lovat,\r\n\"observing their alert and spirited appearance, lifted up their hands to\r\nheaven, and prayed God to prosper their enterprise.\" These simple and\r\ndeluded people, doubtless, but partially understood the nature of that\r\nundertaking which they thus called on Heaven to bless.\r\n\r\nThe Master of Lovat and his party had not proceeded more than four or\r\nfive miles from Inverness, than they observed a large party of \"runners\r\nissuing out of the wood of Bonshrive, which is crossed by the high\r\nroad.\" \"It is a custom,\" adds Lord Lovat, \"in the north of Scotland,\r\nfor almost every gentleman to have a servant in livery, who runs before\r\nhis horse, and who is always at his stirrup when he wishes to mount or\r\nto alight; and however swift any horse may be, a good runner is always\r\nable to match him.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen who attended the Master of Lovat, were soon able to\r\nperceive that Lord Salton was one of the leaders of the party who was\r\nquitting the Wood of Bonshrive, and emerging into the high road; and\r\nthat his Lordship was accompanied by Lord Mungo Murray, a younger son of\r\nthe Marquis of Athole, and, as the Master of Lovat intimates, an early\r\nfriend of his own. The account which Lord Lovat's narrative henceforth\r\npresents, of that which ensued, is so totally at variance with the\r\nevidence on his trial, that it must be disregarded and rejected as\r\nunworthy of credit, as well as the boast with which he concludes it, of\r\nhaving generously saved the lives of Lord Salton, and of his own\r\nkinsman, Lord Mungo. It appeared afterwards, that his followers had\r\norders to seize them, dead or alive.\r\n\r\nThese two young noblemen were, it seems, almost instantly overpowered by\r\nnumbers, notwithstanding the attendance of the \"runners,\" on whom Lord\r\nLovat so much insists. Lord Mungo was taken prisoner by the Master\r\nhimself. They were then deprived of their horses, and being mounted on\r\nponeys, were conducted to Fanellan, guards surrounding them, with their\r\nmuskets loaded, and dirks drawn, to a house belonging to Lord Lovat,\r\nwhere they were kept in close confinement, guarded by a hundred\r\nclansmen. Gibbets were erected under the windows of the house, to\r\nintimidate the prisoners; and at the end of a week they were marched off\r\nto Castle Downie,--the Master of Lovat going there in warlike array,\r\nwith a pair of colours and a body of five hundred men. From Castle\r\nDownie, Lord Salton and Lord Mungo were led away into the islands and\r\nmountains, and were treated with great indignity.\r\n\r\nThese adversaries being thus disposed of, the Master of Lovat invested\r\nthe castle of Downie with an armed force, and soon took possession of a\r\nfortress, tenanted only by a defenceless woman, the Dowager Lady Lovat.\r\nBut that lady was a Murray; one of a resolute family, and descended on\r\nher mother's side from a Stanley. She was the grand-daughter of\r\nCharlotte de la Tremouille, who defended Latham House against the\r\nParliamentary forces in 1644. Notwithstanding that armed men were placed\r\nin the different apartments of the castle, she was undaunted. Attempts\r\nwere made by the Master of Lovat to compel her to sign certain deeds,\r\nsecuring to him that certainty of the right to the estates, for which he\r\nwas ready to plunge in the deepest of crimes. She was firm--she refused\r\nto subscribe her name. Her refusal was the signal, or the incentive, for\r\nthe completion of another plot, of a last resource,--a compulsory\r\nmarriage between the Master of Lovat and herself.\r\n\r\nThe awful and almost incredible details of that last act of infuriated\r\nvillany, prove Lady Lovat to have been a woman of strong resolution,\r\nand of a deep sensibility. The ceremony of marriage was pronounced by\r\nRobert Monro, Minister of Abertaaffe. The unhappy Lady Lovat's\r\nresistance and prayers were heard in the very court-yard below, although\r\nthe sound of bagpipes were intended to drown her screams. Morning found\r\nthe poor wretched being, to make use of one of the expressions used by\r\nan eye-witness, \"out of her judgment; she spoke none, but gave the\r\ndeponent a broad stare.\" For several days reason was not restored to\r\nher, until, greeted by one of her friends with the epithet \"Madam,\" she\r\nanswered, \"Call me not Madam, but the most miserable wretch alive.\" The\r\nscene of this act of diabolical wickedness[143] is razed to the ground:\r\nCastle Downie was burned by the royal troops, in the presence of him who\r\nhad committed such crimes within its walls, and of three hundred of his\r\nclansmen, shortly after the battle of Culloden.\r\n\r\nIt appears from a letter written by Thomas Lovat, the father of the\r\nMaster, to the Duke of Argyle, that he and his son were shortly\r\n\"impeached for a convocation,\" and for making prisoners of Lord Salton\r\nand Lord Mungo Murray, for which they were charged before him, were\r\nfined, discharged their fines, and \"gave security to keep the\r\npeace.\"[144] So lightly was that gross invasion of the liberty that\r\nthreatened the lives of others at first treated! \"We have many\r\nadvertisements,\" adds Thomas Lovat, \"that Athole is coming here in\r\nperson, with all the armed men he is able to make, to compel us to duty,\r\nand that without delay. If he come, so we are resolved to defend\r\nourselves; the laws of God, of nature, and the laws of all nations, not\r\nonly allowing, but obliging all men, _vim vi repellere_. And I should\r\nwish from my heart, if it were consistent with divine and human laws,\r\nthat the estates of Athole and Lovat were laid as a prize, depending on\r\nthe result of a fair day betwixt him and me.\"[145] It was, perhaps, an\r\nendeavour to avert the impending ruin and devastation that followed,\r\nthat the Master of Lovat gave their liberty to Lord Saltoun and Lord\r\nMungo Murray, although not until he had threatened them both with\r\nhanging for interfering with his inheritance, and compelling Lord\r\nSaltoun to promise that he would, on arriving at Inverness, send a\r\nformal obligation for eight thousand pounds, never more to concern\r\nhimself with the affairs of the Lovat estate, and that neither he nor\r\nthe Marquis of Athole would ever prosecute either Lord Lovat or his son,\r\nor their clan in general, for the disgrace they had received in having\r\nbeen made prisoners, for any of the transactions of this affair.[146]\r\n\r\nBut it was evident that, in spite of this concession, the vengeance of\r\nthe Marquis of Athole never slept; and that he was resolved to wreak it\r\nupon the head of the wretch who had for ever blasted the happiness of\r\nhis sister.\r\n\r\nThe Master of Lovat was shortly aware that it would no longer be\r\nprudent to remain with his victim in the castle of Downie. His wife, as\r\nit was then his pleasure to call her, remained in a condition of the\r\ndeepest despair. She would neither eat nor drink whilst she was in his\r\npower; and her health appears to have suffered greatly from distress and\r\nfear. In the dead of night she was summoned to leave Castle Downie, to\r\nbe removed to a more remote and a wilder region, where the unhappy\r\ncreature might naturally expect, from the desperate character of her\r\npretended husband, no mitigation of her sorrows. Since rumours were\r\ndaily increasing of the approach of Lord Athole's troops, the clan of\r\nFraser was again, when Lady Lovat was conveyed from the scene of her\r\nanguish, called forth to assist their leader, and the wail of the\r\ncoronach was again heard in that dismal and portentous night: for\r\nportentous it was. This crime, the first signal offence of Simon Fraser,\r\nstamped his destiny. Its effects followed him through life: it entailed\r\nothers: it was the commencement of a catalogue of iniquities almost\r\nunprecedented in the career of one man's existence.\r\n\r\nCrushed, broken-spirited, afraid of returning to her kindred, whose high\r\nfame she seems to have thought would be sullied by her misfortunes, Lady\r\nLovat was conducted by Fraser to the Island of Aigas. They stole thither\r\non horseback, attended by a single servant, and arriving at the\r\nsea-shore, they there took a boat, and were carried to the obscure\r\nisland which Fraser had chosen for his retreat. Thomas Fraser of\r\nBeaufort, the father of Simon, thus writes to the Duke of Argyle\r\nrespecting this singular and revolting union.\r\n\r\n\"We have gained a considerable advantage by my eldest son's being\r\nmarried to the Dowager of Lovat; and if it please God they live together\r\nsome years, our circumstances will be very good. Our enemies are so\r\ngalled at it, that there is nothing malice or cruelty can invent but\r\nthey design and practice against us; so that we are forced to take to\r\nthe hills, and keep spies at all parts; by which, among many other\r\ndifficulties, the greatest is this,--that my daughter-in-law, being a\r\ntender creature, fatigue and fear of bloodshed may put an end to her,\r\nwhich would make our condition worse than ever.\"[147]\r\n\r\nAnd now there took place, in the mind of Lady Lovat, one of those\r\nsingular revulsions which experience teaches us to explain rather than\r\ninduces us to believe as neither impossible nor uncommon. Lady Lovat, it\r\nis said upon the grave authority of a reverend biographer, became\r\nattached to the bonds which held her. \"Here,\" says Mr. Arbuthnot, in his\r\nLife of Lord Lovat,[148] \"he continued a month or six weeks, and by this\r\ntime the captain had found means to work himself so effectually into the\r\ngood graces of the lady, that, as he reported, 'she doated on him, and\r\nwas always unhappy at his absence.'\" However true or however false this\r\nrepresentation may be, the marriage service was again, as it was said,\r\nsolemnized, at the suggestion of the Master of Lovat, and with the free\r\nconsent of Lady Lovat.[149] On the twenty-sixth of October, 1697, we\r\nfind Simon Fraser writing in the following terms to the Laird of\r\nCulloden. The answer is not given in the Culloden Papers, but it not\r\nimprobably contained a recommendation to repeat the marriage\r\nceremonials:--\r\n\r\n                                  \"Beaufort, the 26th of Oct., 1797.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"Thir Lords att Inverness, with the rest of my implacable enemies,\r\n    does so confound my wife, that she is uneasy till she see them. I am\r\n    afraid that they are so madd with this disapointment, that they will\r\n    propose something to her that is dangerous, her brother having such\r\n    power with her; so that really, till things be perfectly\r\n    accommodatt, I do nott desire they should see her, and I know not\r\n    how to manage her. So I hope you will send all the advice you can to\r\n    your oblidged humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                       SIM.

FRASER.\"\r\n\r\nLady Lovat lived to hear her husband deny that he had ever sought her in\r\nmarriage, and to see him married to two different wives; and he scrupled\r\nnot to represent the unfortunate Lady Lovat as the last possible object\r\nof his regard--as a \"widow, old enough to be his mother, dwarfish in her\r\nperson, and deformed in her shape.\"[150] This, as far as related to\r\ndisparity of years, was untrue; the Dowager was only four years older\r\nthan the Master of Lovat.\r\n\r\nMeantime justice had not slumbered; and one morning, a charge \"against\r\nCaptain Simon Fraser, of Beaufort, and many others, persons mostly of\r\nthe clan Fraser, for high treason, in forming unlawful associations,\r\ncollecting an armed force, occupying and fortifying houses and\r\ngarrisons, &c.,\" was left by the herald, pursuant to an old Scottish\r\ncustom, in a cloven stick which was deposited at the river side,\r\nopposite to the Isle of Aigas.[151] Of this no notice was taken by\r\nSimon, except to renew his addresses to his clan, and to hasten, as far\r\nas he could from his secluded retreat, a systematic resistance to the\r\nMarquis of Athole, and even to the royal troops, whose approach was\r\nexpected. But his fears were aroused. Again he sought to avert the\r\ncoming danger by concession; and he determined, in the first instance,\r\non restoring Lady Lovat to her friends.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Mr. Arbuthnot, but still on the authority of the Master\r\nof Lovat, that Lady Lovat had now become reluctant to return to her\r\nrelations. Nor is it improbable that this statement is true, without\r\nreferring that reluctance to any affection for the wretch with whom her\r\nfate was linked. She complied, nevertheless, with the proposal of the\r\nMaster; and leaving the Island of Aigas, she proceeded first to Castle\r\nDownie, and afterwards to Dunkeld, where, according to Arbuthnot, she\r\nwas obliged by her brother, the Marquis, to join in a prosecution\r\nagainst her husband, for a crime which she had forgiven. According to a\r\nletter from the Duke of Argyle, addressed to the Rev. Mr. Carstares,\r\nchaplain to King William, she fully exculpated the Master from the\r\ncharges made against him on her account.[152] This exculpation was\r\ndoubtless given when the unhappy woman was under the influence of that\r\nsubtle and powerful mind, which lent its aid to its guilty schemes.\r\nSimon Fraser himself, as we have seen, in writing to Duncan Forbes,\r\ndeclared--\"I am very hopeful in my dear wife's constancy, if they do not\r\nput her to death.\" This might be only a part of his usual acting,--a\r\ntrait of that dissimulation which was the moral taint of his character;\r\nor it may have been true that the humiliated being whom he called his\r\nwife had really learned to cherish one who seemed born to be distrusted,\r\nhated, and shunned.\r\n\r\nThe return of Lady Lovat to her family was of no avail in mitigating the\r\nindignation of the Marquis of Athole. By his influence with the Privy\r\nCouncil, who were, it is said, completely under his control, he procured\r\nan order from King William for the march of troops against the clan of\r\nFraser, with instructions, according to Simon Fraser, to overrun the\r\ncountry, to burn, kill, and to destroy the whole clan, without\r\nexception; and, without issuing a citation to Thomas Fraser of Beaufort,\r\nor to his son, to appear--without examining a single witness--a printed\r\nsentence was published against all the Frasers, men and women and\r\nchildren, and their adherents. Even the sanctuary of churches was not to\r\nbe respected: \"in a word,\" says Lord Lovat's Manifesto, \"history, sacred\r\nor profane, cannot produce an order so pregnant with such unexampled\r\ncruelty as this sentence, which is carefully preserved in the house of\r\nLovat, to the eternal confusion and infamy of those who signed it.\"[153]\r\nThe Government which sanctioned the massacre of Glencoe was perfectly\r\ncapable of issuing a proclamation which confounded the innocent with the\r\nguilty, and punished before trial.\r\n\r\nThe Master of Lovat assembled his clan. That simple and faithful people,\r\ntrusting in the worth and honour of their leader, swore that they would\r\nnever desert him, that they would leave their wives, their children, and\r\nall that they most valued, to live and die with him. An organized\r\nresistance was planned; and the Master of Lovat intreated his father, as\r\nhe himself expressed it, with tears, \"to retire into the country of his\r\nkinsmen, the Macleods of Rye.\" The proposal was accepted, and Thomas of\r\nBeaufort, for he never assumed the disputed title of Lord Lovat, took\r\nrefuge among that powerful and friendly clan.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution against the Master of Lovat was, in the mean time,\r\ncommenced in the Court of Justiciary; \"the only case,\" so it has been\r\ncalled, \"since the Revolution, in which a person was tried in absence,\r\nbefore the Court of Justiciary, a proof led, a jury inclosed, a verdict\r\nreturned, and sentence pronounced; forfeiting life, estate, honours,\r\nfame, and posterity.\"[154] None of the parties who were summoned,\r\nappeared. The jury returned a verdict finding the indictment proved, and\r\nthe Court adjudged Captain Fraser and the other persons accused, to be\r\nexecuted as traitors; \"their name, fame, memory, and honours, to be\r\nextinct, and their arms to be riven forth and deleted out of the books\r\nof arms; so that their posterity may never have place, nor be able\r\nhereafter to bruite or enjoy any honours, offices, titles, or dignities;\r\nand to have forfeited all their lands, heritages, and possessions\r\nwhatsoever.\"[155]\r\n\r\nAfter this sentence, a severer one than that usually passed in such\r\ncases, the Master of Lovat, for the period of four years, led a life of\r\nskirmishes, escapes, and hardships of every description. He retired into\r\nthe remote Highlands, then almost impenetrable; and, followed by a small\r\nband of his clansmen, he wandered from mountain to mountain, resolved\r\nnever to submit, nor yield himself up to justice. Since his father's\r\nestates were forfeited, and he could draw no means of subsistence from\r\nthem, he was often obliged to the charity of the hospitable Highlanders\r\nfor some of their coarse fare; and when that resource failed, or when he\r\nhad lived too long on the bounty of a neighbourhood, he and his\r\ncompanions made nightly incursions into the Lowlands, and, carrying off\r\ncattle and provisions, retreated again to their caverns, there to\r\nsatisfy hunger with the fruits of their incursions.[156]\r\n\r\nDuring the four years of misery and peril in which the Master of Lovat\r\ncontinued to evade justice, his father died, among his relations in the\r\nisland of Skye. His decease was caused, according to the representation\r\nof his son, by a hasty march made to escape the King's troops, who, he\r\nheard, were coming to the islands to pursue him. Among the few humane\r\ntraits in the character of Simon Fraser, the habitual respect and\r\naffection borne by the Highlanders to parents appears to have been\r\nperceptible. He speaks of Thomas of Beaufort in his Life with regret and\r\nregard; but seals those expressions of tenderness with an oath that he\r\n\"would revenge himself on his own and his father's enemies with their\r\nblood, or perish in the attempt.\" Such were his notions of filial piety.\r\n\r\nThe Master of Lovat had now attained the rank for which he had made such\r\nsacrifices of safety and of fame; and had the hollow satisfaction of a\r\ndisputed title, with an attainted estate, and a life over which the\r\nsword of destiny was suspended.\r\n\r\nA sentence of outlawry followed that of condemnation, and letters of\r\nfire and sword were issued against him. He was forbidden all\r\ncorrespondence or intercourse with his fellow subjects: he was cast off\r\nand rejected by his friends, and in constant danger either of being\r\ncaptured by the officers of justice, or assassinated by his enemies. The\r\ncommission for destroying the clan of Fraser was not, indeed, put into\r\nexecution; but that wild and beautiful district which owned him for its\r\nlord, was ravaged by the King's troops stationed at Inverness, or\r\nintimidated by the Highland army, commanded by Lord Lovat's early\r\ncompanions, but now deadly foes,--Lord James and Lord Mungo Murray. At\r\nlength, after gaining a complete victory, according to his own account,\r\nat Stratheric, over the tributaries of Lord Athole, and extracting from\r\nthe prisoners an oath by which they \"renounced the claims on our\r\nSaviour and their hopes in Heaven if ever they returned to the\r\nterritories of his enemy, the guilty and unfortunate man grew weary of\r\nhis life of wandering, penury, and disgrace.\"\r\n\r\nHe was always fertile in expedients, and audacious in proffering his\r\npetitions for mercy. During his father's life, a petition in the form of\r\na letter, written by Thomas of Beaufort, and signed by seven Frasers,\r\nhad been addressed to the Duke of Argyle, appealing to his aid at Court,\r\nupon the plea of that \"entire friendship which the family of Lovat had\r\nwith, and dependence upon, that of Argyle, grounded upon an ancient\r\npropinquity of blood, and zealously maintained by both through a tract\r\nand series of many ages.\"[157] The Duke of Argyle had, it was well\r\nunderstood, made some applications on behalf of the Frasers; and Lord\r\nLovat now resolved to push his interest in the same friendly quarter,\r\nand to endeavour to obtain a remission of the sentence out against his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHis efforts were the more successful, because King William had by this\r\ntime begun to suspect the fidelity of Lord Tullibardine, and to place a\r\nstrong reliance upon the integrity and abilities of the Duke of Argyle.\r\nThe Duke represented to his Majesty not only the ancient friendship\r\nsubsisting between the house of Campbell and that of Fraser, but also\r\nthat the King might spend \"a hundred times the value of the Fraser\r\nestate before he could reduce it, on account of its inaccessible\r\nsituation and its connection with the neighbouring clans.\"[158] The\r\nDuke's account of his success is given with characteristic good sense in\r\nthe following letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARL OF ARGYLE TO THE LAIRD OF CULLODEN.\r\n\r\n                                          \"Edinburgh, Sept. 5, 1700.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"In complyance with your desyre and a great many other gentlemen,\r\n    with my own inclination to endeavour a piece of justice, I have made\r\n    it my chief concern to obtain Beaufort's (now I think I may say Lord\r\n    Lovatt's) pardon, and the other gentlemen concerned with him in the\r\n    convocation and seizing of prisoners, which are crymes more\r\n    immediately against his Majesty, which I have at last obtained and\r\n    have it in my custody. I designe to-morrow for Argyllshire; and,\r\n    there not being a quorum of Exchequer in town, am oblidged to delay\r\n    passing the remission till next moneth. We have all had lyes enuf of\r\n    his Majestie before: his goodness in this will, I hope, return my\r\n    friend Culloden to his old consistency, and make E. Argyll appear to\r\n    him as good a Presbiterian and a weel wisher to his country in no\r\n    lesse a degree then Tullibardine, who plundered my land some tyme\r\n    agoe, and Culloden's lately. Pray recover the same spiritt you had\r\n    at the Revolution; let us lay assyde all resentments ill founded,\r\n    all projects which may shake our foundation; let us follow no more\r\n    phantasms (I may say rather divells), who, with a specious pretext\r\n    leading us into the dark, may drownd us.

Let me have a plain satisfactorie answer from you, that I may\r\n    be in perfect charitie with Culloden. Adieu.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Duke having obtained his pardon, Lord Lovat was\r\nenjoined to lay down his arms, and to go privately to London. That\r\nsentence, which had followed the prosecution on the part of Lady Lovat,\r\nwas not, at that time, remitted, for fear of disobliging the Athole\r\nfamily. Upon arriving in London, Lord Lovat found that Lord Seafield,\r\nthe colleague of the Earl of Tullibardine, was disinclined to risk\r\nincurring the displeasure of the Athole family. He put off the signing\r\nof the pardon from time to time. He was even so much in awe of the Earl\r\nof Tullibardine, that he endeavoured to get the King to sign the pardon\r\nwhen he was at Loo; that Mr. Pringle, the other Secretary of State,\r\nmight bear the odium of presenting it for signature. During this delay,\r\nLord Lovat, not being able with safety to return to Scotland, resolved\r\nto occupy the interval of suspense by a journey into France.\r\n\r\nWhilst Lord Lovat's affairs were in this condition, the Marquis of\r\nAthole, resolved for ever to put it out of Lord Lovat's power to gain\r\nany ascendancy over the young heiress of Lovat, Amelia Fraser, was\r\nemployed in arranging a marriage for that lady to the son of Alexander\r\nMackenzie, Lord Prestonhall. It was agreed, by a marriage settlement,\r\nthat Mr. Mackenzie should take the name and title of Fraserdale, and\r\nthat the children of that marriage should bear the name of Fraser. The\r\nestate of Lovat was settled upon Fraserdale in his life, with remainder\r\nto his children by his wife.[159] It indeed appears, that the estate of\r\nLovat was never surrendered to Lord Lovat; that he bore in Scotland,\r\naccording to some statements, no higher title than that of Lord of\r\nBeaufort; and that a regular receiver of the rents was appointed by the\r\nguardians of Amelia Fraser:[160] so completely were the dark designs of\r\nSimon Fraser defeated in their object! He was, however, graciously\r\nreceived at St. Germains, whither he went whilst yet, James the Second,\r\nin all the glory of a sanctified superstition, lived with his Queen, the\r\nfaithful partner of his misfortunes. Lord Lovat ascribes this visit to\r\nSt. Germains to his intention of dissipating the calumnious stories\r\ncirculated against him by the Marquis of Athole. The flourishing\r\nstatement which he gives in his memoirs of King James's reception, may,\r\nhowever, be treated as wholly apocryphal. James the Second, with all his\r\nerrors, was too shrewd a man, too practised in kingcraft, to speak of\r\nthe \"perfidious family of Athole,\" or to mention the head of that noble\r\nhouse by the title of that \"old traitor.\" Lord Lovat's incapacity to\r\nwrite the truth, and his perpetual endeavour to magnify himself in his\r\nnarrative, cause us equally to distrust the existence of that document,\r\nwith the royal seal affixed to it, which he says the King signed with\r\nhis own hand, declaring that he would protect Lord Lovat from \"the\r\nperfidious and faithless family of Athole.\"[161]\r\n\r\nThe fact is, and it redounds to the credit of James the Second, that\r\nmonarch, eager as he ever remained to attach partisans to his interests,\r\nnever received Lord Lovat into his presence.[162] The infamy of the\r\nexploits of the former Master of Lovat had preceded his visit to France:\r\nthe whole account of his own reception at St. Germains, written with\r\nastonishing audacity, and most circumstantially worded, was a\r\nfabrication.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat's usual readiness in difficulties did not fail him; he was a\r\nruined man, and it was puerile to shrink from expedients. He applied to\r\nthe Pope's nuncio, and expressed his readiness to become a Roman\r\nCatholic. The suit was, of course, encouraged, and the arch hypocrite,\r\nmaking a recantation of all his former errors, professed himself a\r\nmember of the holy Catholic Church, and acknowledged the Pope as its\r\nhead. This avowal cost him little, for he was by no means prejudiced in\r\nfavour of any specific faith; and it gained him for the time, some\r\nlittle popularity in the gay metropolis in which he had taken refuge.\r\n\r\nKing James, indeed, to his honour, was still resolute in declining his\r\npersonal homage; but Louis the Fourteenth was less scrupulous, and the\r\nMarquis de Torcy, the favourite and Minister of the French King,\r\npresented the abjured of England and Scotland at the Palais of\r\nVersailles. It is difficult to picture to oneself the savage and\r\nmerciless Fraser, the pillager, the destroyer, the outlaw, conversing,\r\nas he is said to have done, with the saintly and sagacious Madame\r\nMaintenon. It is scarcely possible to conceive elegant and refined women\r\nof any nation receiving this depraved, impenitent man, with the rumour\r\nof his recent crimes still fresh in their memory, into their polished\r\ncircles. Yet they made no scruple in that dissolute city, to associate\r\nwith the abandoned wretch who dared not return to Scotland, and who only\r\nlooked for a pardon for his crimes through the potent workings of a\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat well knew the value of female influence. He dressed in the\r\nheight of fashion--he adapted his language and sentiments to the tone of\r\nthose around the Court. He was a man of considerable conversational\r\ntalents; \"his deportment,\" says his biographer, \"was graceful and\r\nmanly.\" When he was first presented to Louis the Fourteenth, who was\r\ndesirous of asking some questions concerning the invasion of Scotland,\r\nhe is said to have prepared an elaborate address, which he forgot in the\r\nconfusion produced by the splendour around him, but to have delivered an\r\nable extempore speech, with infinite ease and good taste, upon the spur\r\nof the moment, to the great amusement of Louis, who learned from De\r\nTorcy the circumstance.[163]\r\n\r\nHis advancement at the Court of Versailles was interrupted by the\r\nnecessity of his return to England, in order to obtain at last a final\r\npardon from the King for his offences. It is singular that the\r\ninstrument by whom he sought to procure this remission was William\r\nCarstairs, that extraordinary man, who had suffered in the reign of\r\nJames the Second the thumb-screw, and had been threatened with the iron\r\nboot, for refusing to disclose the correspondence between the friends of\r\nthe Revolution. Mr. Carstairs was now secretary to King William, and he\r\nlittle knew, when he counselled that monarch to pardon Lovat, what a\r\npartisan of the Jacobite cause he was thus restoring to society.\r\n\r\nHis mediation was effectual, perhaps owing to a dislike which had arisen\r\nin the mind of William against the Athole family; and a pardon was\r\nprocured for Lord Lovat. The affair was concluded at Loo, whither Lovat\r\nfollowed the King from England. \"He is a bold man,\" the Monarch is said\r\nto have observed to Carstairs, \"to come so far under sentence of death.\"\r\nThe pardon was unlimited, and that it might comprise the offence against\r\nLady Athole, it was now \"a complete and ample pardon for every\r\nimaginable crime.\" The royal seal was appended to it, and there remained\r\nonly to get that of Scotland also affixed.\r\n\r\nLovat entrusted the management of that delicate and difficult matter to\r\na cousin, a Simon Fraser also, by whose treachery it was suppressed; and\r\nLord Seafield caused another pardon to pass the great seal, in which the\r\ntreason against King William was alone specified; and other offences\r\nwere left unpardoned. Upon this, Lord Lovat cited the Marquis of Athole\r\nbefore the Lords Justiciary in Edinburgh to answer before them for a\r\nfalse accusation: but on the very day of supporting his charge, as the\r\nbiographer of his family relates, his patron the Duke of Argyle was\r\ninformed that the judges had been corrupted, and that \"certain death\r\nwould be the result if he appeared.\"[164] This statement is taken from\r\nLord Lovat's own complication of falsehoods, his incomparably audacious\r\n\"Manifesto.\" Notwithstanding that Lovat had appeared with a retinue of a\r\nhundred armed gentlemen, \"as honorable as himself,\" with the intention\r\nof intimidating the judges;--in spite of the Duke of Argyle's powerful\r\ninfluence, the friends of the outlawed nobleman counselled him again to\r\nretreat to England, and to suffer judgment to go by default. The Duke of\r\nArgyle, he says, would not lose sight of him till he had seen him on\r\nhorseback, and had ordered his own best horse to be brought round to the\r\ndoor. There was no remedy for what was called by Lord Lovat's friends,\r\nthe \"rascality\" of the judges:--and again this unworthy Highlander was\r\ndriven from his own country to seek safety in the land wherein his\r\noffences had received their pardon. The inflexibility of the justiciary\r\nlords, or their known integrity, form a fine incident in history; for\r\nthe Scottish nation was at this period, ridden by Court faction, and\r\nbroken down by recent oppression and massacre.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat, meeting the Duke of Argyle on the frontiers, accompanied his\r\nGrace to London; and here, notwithstanding his boast, \"that after his\r\narrival in London he was at the Duke's house every day,\" he appears,\r\nabout this time, to have been reduced to a state of miserable poverty,\r\nand merited desertion.\r\n\r\nIn the following letter to Mr. Carstairs, he complains that nothing is\r\ndone for him--he applies to Mr. Carstairs for a little money to carry\r\nhim home, \"having no other door open.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD LOVAT TO MR. CARSTAIRS,\r\n\r\n                                           \"London, June 20th, 1701.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n    \"I reckon myself very unhappy that my friends here do so much\r\n    neglect me; and I believe my last journey to England has done me a\r\n    vast prejudice; for if I had been at home, I would have got\r\n    something done in my Lord Evelin's business, and would have got\r\n    money before now, that might serve me to go a volunteer with the\r\n    King, or maintain me anywhere; but my friend at home must have worse\r\n    thoughts now of my affairs than ever, having staid so long here, and\r\n    got nothing done. However, I now resolve to go to Scotland, not\r\n    being able to subsist longer here. I have sent the inclosed note,\r\n    that, according to your kind promise, I may have the little money\r\n    which will carry me home, and it shall be precisely paid before two\r\n    months; and I must say, it is one of the greatest favours ever was\r\n    done me, not having any other door open, if you were not so generous\r\n    as to assist me, which I shall alwise gratefully remember, and\r\n    continue with all sincerity, Dear Sir, Your faithful and obliged\r\n    servant,\r\n\r\n                                                             LOVAT.\"\r\n\r\nThe death of William the Third revived the hopes of the Jacobite party;\r\nand to that centre of attraction the ruined and the restless, the\r\naspiring and the profligate, alike turned their regards. Never was so\r\ngreat a variety of character, and so great a diversity of motives\r\ndisplayed in any cause, as in the various attempts which were made to\r\nsecure the restoration of the Stuarts. On some natures those opinions,\r\nthose schemes, which were generally known under the name of Jacobitism,\r\nacted as an incentive to self-sacrifice--and to a constancy worthy of\r\nbetter fortune. In other minds the poison of faction worked irremediable\r\nmischief: many who began with great and generous resolves, sank into\r\nintrigue, and ended in infidelity to the cause which that had espoused.\r\nBut Lord Lovat came under neither of these classes; he knew not the\r\nexistence of a generous emotion; he was consistent in the undeviating\r\nselfishness and baseness of his career.\r\n\r\nIf he had a sincere predilection, he was disposed to the interest of\r\nKing James. Hereditary tendencies scarcely ever lose their hold upon the\r\nmind entirely: notions on politics are formed at a much earlier age\r\nthan is generally supposed. The family of Fraser had been, as we have\r\nseen, from ages immemorial employed in defence of the Stuart Kings; and\r\nearly prepossessions were imbibed by the unworthy descendant of a brave\r\nrace, before his passions had interfered to warp the generous sentiment\r\nof loyalty. As he grew up, Lord Lovat learned to accommodate himself to\r\nany party; and it was justly observed by Lord Middleton, one of the\r\nfavourite courtiers at St. Germains, that though he boasted so much of\r\nhis adherence to his Sovereign, he had never served any sovereign but\r\nKing William, in whose army he had commanded a regiment.[165]\r\n\r\nThe period was now, however, approaching, when he whose moral atmosphere\r\nwas, like his native climate, the tempest and the whirlwind, might hope\r\nto glean some benefit from the impending storm which threatened the\r\npeace of the British empire.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of September, 1701, James the Second of England expired at\r\nSt. Germains. This event was favourable to those of the Jacobite party\r\nwho wished to bring forward the interests of the young Prince of Wales.\r\nJames had long been infirm, and had laid aside all schemes of worldly\r\nelevation. He had passed his time between the diversion of hunting and\r\nthe duties of religion. His widowed Queen retained, on the contrary, an\r\nardent desire to see her son restored to the throne of England. She\r\nimplanted that wish in his own breast; she nourished it by the society\r\nof those whom she placed around him; and she passed her time in\r\nconstantly forming new schemes for the promotion of that restoration to\r\nwhich her sanguine anticipations were continually directed.\r\n\r\nThe death of James was succeeded by two events: one, the avowed\r\ndetermination of Louis the Fourteenth to take the exiled family of\r\nStuart under his protection, and the consequent proclamation of the\r\nyoung Prince of Wales as King of England; the other, the bill for the\r\nattainder of the pretended Prince of Wales, in the English Parliament,\r\nwith an additional clause of attainder against the Queen, Mary of\r\nModena, together with an oath of abjuration of the \"Pretender.\" The\r\ndebates which impeded the progress of this measure, plainly prove how\r\ndeeply engrafted in the hearts of many of the higher classes were those\r\nrights which they were thus enforced to abjure.[166]\r\n\r\nThis was one of the last acts of William. His death, in 1702, revived\r\nthe spirits of the Jacobites, for the partiality of Anne to her brother,\r\nthe young Prince, was generally understood; and it appears, from the\r\nletters which have been published in later days to have been of a far\r\nmore real and sisterly character than has generally been supposed. The\r\ndeath of the young Duke of Gloucester appeared, naturally, to make way\r\nfor the restoration of the Stuart family; and there is no doubt but that\r\nAnne earnestly desired it; and that on one occasion, when her brother's\r\nlife was in danger from illness, her anxiety was considerable on his\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, no matter of reproach to the Jacobites, as an\r\ninfatuation, although it has frequently been so represented, that they\r\ncherished those schemes which were ultimately so unfortunate, but which,\r\nhad it not been that \"popery appeared more dreadful in England than even\r\nthe prospect of slavery and temporal oppression,\" would doubtless have\r\nbeen successful without the disastrous scenes which marked the struggle\r\nto bring them to bear.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat was at this time no insignificant instrument in the hands of\r\nthe Jacobite party. When he found that the sentence of outlawry was not\r\nreversed; when he perceived that he must no longer hope for the\r\npeaceable enjoyment of the Lovat inheritance, his whole soul turned to\r\nthe restoration of King James; and, after his death, to that of the\r\nyoung Prince of Wales. Yet he seems, in the course of the extraordinary\r\naffairs in which the Queen, Mary of Modena, was rash enough to employ\r\nhim, to have one eye fixed upon St. James's, another upon St. Germains,\r\nand to have been perfectly uncertain as to which power he should\r\neventually dedicate his boasted influence and talents.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat may be regarded as the first promoter of the Insurrection of\r\n1715 in Scotland. Whether his exertions proceeded from a real endeavour\r\nto promote the cause of the Jacobites, or whether they were, as it has\r\nbeen supposed, the result of a political scheme of the Duke of\r\nQueensbury's, it is difficult to determine, and immaterial to decide;\r\nbecause his perfidy in disclosing the whole to that nobleman has been\r\nclearly discovered. It seems, however, more than probable, that he could\r\nnot go on in the straightforward path; and that he was in the employ of\r\nthe Duke of Queensbury from the first, has been confidently stated.[167]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1702, Lord Lovat went to France, and pretending to have\r\nauthority from some of the Highland clans and Scottish nobility, offered\r\nthe services of his countrymen to the Court of St. Germains. This offer\r\nwas made shortly before the death of James the Second, and a proposal\r\nwas made in the name of the Scottish Jacobites to raise an army of\r\ntwelve thousand men, if the King of France would consent to land five\r\nthousand men at Dundee, and five hundred at Fort William. His proposals\r\nwere listened to, but his integrity was suspected.[168]\r\n\r\nAccording to his own account, Lord Lovat, being in full possession of\r\nhis family honours, upon the death of King William, immediately\r\nproclaimed the Prince of Wales in his own province, and acting, as he\r\ndeclares, in accordance with the advice of his friend, the Duke of\r\nArgyle, repaired to France, \"in order to do the best that he could in\r\nthat country.\"[169]\r\n\r\nHe immediately, to pursue his own statement, engaged the Earl Lord\r\nMarischal, the Earl of Errol, Lord Constable of Scotland, in the cause;\r\nand then, passing through England and Holland, in order to go to France\r\nthrough Flanders, he arrived in Paris with this commission about the\r\nmonth of September.\r\n\r\nSir John Maclean, cousin-german of Lord Lovat, had resided ten years at\r\nthe Court of St. Germains, and to his guidance Lovat confided himself.\r\nBy Maclean, Lovat was introduced to the Duke of Perth, as he was called,\r\nwho had been Chancellor of Scotland when James the Second abdicated, and\r\nwhose influence was now divided at the Court of St. Germains, by the\r\nEarl of Middleton. For never was faction more virulent than in the Court\r\nof the exiled Monarch, and during the minority of his son. The Duke of\r\nPerth represented Lord Middleton as a \"faithless traitor, a pensionary\r\nof the English Parliament, to give intelligence of all that passes at\r\nthe Court of St. Germains.\" It was therefore agreed that this scheme of\r\nthe invasion should be carried on unknown to that nobleman, and to this\r\nsecrecy the Queen, it is said, gave her consent. She hailed the prospect\r\nof an insurrection in Scotland with joy, and declared twenty times to\r\nLord Lovat that she had sent her jewels to Paris to be sold, in order to\r\nsend the twenty thousand crowns,[170] which Lord Lovat represented would\r\nbe necessary to equip the Highland forces. Hitherto the Court of St.\r\nGermains had been contented merely to keep up a correspondence with\r\ntheir friends, retaining them in their principles, though without any\r\nexpectation of immediate assistance. The offer of Lord Lovat was the\r\nfirst step towards more active exertions in the cause of the Stuarts. It\r\nis in this sense that he may almost be considered as the father of the\r\nRebellion of 1715. He first excited those ardent spirits to unanimity\r\nand to action; and the project of restoration, which only languished\r\nwhilst Anne lived, was never afterwards abandoned until after the year\r\n1746.\r\n\r\nEither through the indiscretion of Queen Mary of Modena, or through some\r\nother channel, the plot of the invasion became known to Lord Middleton.\r\nJealous of the family of Perth, his avowed enemies, Lord Middleton,\r\naccording to Lord Lovat, was enraged at the project, and determined to\r\nruin the projectors. It is very true that the antipathies between the\r\nprevailing factions may have excited Lord Middleton's anger; but it is\r\nevident, from his lordship's letters and memoranda, that his dislike had\r\na far deeper source--the profligacy of the agent Lovat; a profligacy\r\nwhich had deterred, as it was afterwards found, many of the Highland\r\nchiefs from lending their aid to the cause. Party fury, however, ran\r\nhigh, and before the affair of the insurrection could be settled, Lord\r\nMiddleton, declaring that the last words of King James had made a\r\npowerful impression on his mind, retired into the convent of\r\nBenedictines at Paris, to be satisfied of some doubts, and to be\r\ninstructed in the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. But this\r\ntemporary retirement rather revived than decreased the favour of the\r\nQueen towards him. She trusted to his advice; and, as the statement\r\nwhich Lord Lovat gave of the affairs of Scotland appeared too favourable\r\nto the excluded family to be believed, Louis the Fourteenth counselled\r\nthe Court of St. Germains to send with Lord Lovat, or, as he is\r\ninvariably called in all contemporary documents, Simon Fraser, a person\r\nwho could be trusted to bring back a genuine account. Accordingly, James\r\nMurray of Stanhope, the brother of Sir David Murray, was employed to\r\nthis effect. \"He was,\" says Lord Lovat, \"a spy of Lord Middleton's, his\r\nsworn creature, and a man who had no other means of subsistence.\"[171]\r\nFrom other accounts, however, Mr. Murray is shown to have been a man of\r\nprobity, although in great pecuniary difficulties, as many of the\r\nyounger members of old families were at that time.[172] Mr. James Murray\r\nwas sent forward into Scotland six weeks before Lord Lovat set out from\r\nFrance; and the Court had the wisdom to send with the latter another\r\nemissary in the person of Mr. John Murray, of Abercairney.\r\n\r\nAfter these arrangements were completed, Lord Lovat received his\r\ncommission. He set out upon his expedition by way of Brussels, to\r\nCalais. Not being furnished with passports, and having no other pass\r\nthan the orders of the Marquis De Torcy to the commandants of the\r\ndifferent forts upon the coast, he was obliged also, to wait for an\r\nentire month, the arrival of an English packet for the exchange of\r\nprisoners,--the captain of the vessel having been bribed to take him and\r\nhis companions on board as English prisoners of war, and to put them on\r\nshore during the night, in his boat, near Dover.\r\n\r\nThrough the interest of Louis the Fourteenth, Lovat had received the\r\ncommission from King James of major-general, with power to raise and\r\ncommand forces in his behalf:[173] and thus provided, he proceeded to\r\nScotland, where he was met by the Duke of Argyle, his friend, and\r\nconducted by that nobleman to Edinburgh. Such was the simple statement\r\nof Lovat's first steps on this occasion. According to his memorial,\r\nwhich he afterwards presented to Queen Mary, he received assurances of\r\nsupport from the Catholic gentry of Durham, who, \"when he showed them\r\nthe King's picture, fell down on their knees and kissed it.\"[174] This\r\nflattering statement appeared, however, to resemble the rest of the\r\nmemorial of his proceedings, and met with little or no credence even in\r\nthe quarter where it was most likely to be well received.\r\n\r\nFrom the Duke of Queensbury, Lord Lovat received a pass to go into the\r\nHighlands, which was procured under feigned names, both for him and his\r\ntwo companions, from Lord Nottingham, then Secretary of State. After\r\nthis necessary preliminary, Lord Lovat made a tour among some of the\r\nprincipal nobility in the Lowlands. He found them, even according to\r\nhis own statement, averse to take up arms without an express commission\r\nfrom the King. But he remarks, writing always as he does in the third\r\nperson, \"My Lord Lovat pursued his journey to the Highlands, where they\r\nwere overjoyed to see him, because they believed him dead, having been\r\nfourteen months in France, without writing any word to his country. They\r\ncame from all quarters to see him. He showed them the King's\r\ninstructions, and the King of France's great promises. They were\r\nravished to see them, and prayed to God to have their King there, and\r\nthey should soon put him on the throne. My Lord Lovat told them that\r\nthey must first fight for him, and beat his enemies in the kingdom. They\r\nanswered him, that, if they got the assistance he promised them, they\r\nwould march in three days' advertisement, and beat all the King's\r\nenemies in the kingdom.\"[175] This statement, though possibly not wholly\r\nuntrue, must be taken with more than the usual degree of allowance for\r\nthe exaggeration of a partisan. Many of the Highland noblemen and\r\nchieftains were, indeed, well disposed to the cause of which Lord Lovat\r\nwas the unfortunate and unworthy representative; but all regretted that\r\ntheir young King, as they styled him, should repose trust in so bad a\r\ncharacter, and in many instances refused to treat with Lovat. And,\r\nindeed, the partial success which he attained might be ascribed to the\r\ncredit of his companion Captain John Murray, a gentleman of good family,\r\nwhose brother, Murray of Abercairney, was greatly respected in his\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nThe embryo of the two Rebellions may be distinctly traced in the plain\r\nand modest memorial which Captain Murray also presented, on his return\r\nfrom Scotland, at the Court of St. Germains. \"The Earl and Countess of\r\nErrol,\" he relates, \"with their son Lord Hay, were the first to whom I\r\nspoke of the affairs of the King of England.\" \"Speaking at Edinburgh\r\nwith the King's friends, about his Majesty's affairs, in a more serious\r\nway than I had done before, I found that these affairs had not been\r\nmentioned among them a long time before, and that it was to them an\r\nagreeable surprise to see some hopes that they were to be revived by my\r\nnegotiation.\"\r\n\r\nThe greatest families in Scotland were, indeed,[176] ready to come\r\nforward upon condition of a certain assistance from France; and a scheme\r\nseems even to have been suggested for the invasion of England, and to\r\nhave formed the main feature in one of those various plots which were as\r\noften concerted, and as often defeated, in favour of the excluded\r\nfamily.[177]\r\n\r\nIn France, these continual schemes, and the various changes in the\r\nEnglish Government, were regarded with the utmost contempt. \"The\r\npeople,\" writes the Duke of Perth, Chancellor of Scotland, \"are kept\r\nfrom amusement, frameing conceits of government and religion, such as\r\nour giddy people frame to themselves, and make themselves the scorn and\r\nreproach of mankind, for all are now foes under the name of English,\r\nand we are said to be so changeable and foolish, that nothing from our\r\nparts seems strange. Beheading, dethroning, and banishing of kings,\r\nbeing but children's play with us.\"[178]\r\n\r\nBut all the promise of this plan was defeated, as it is generally and\r\nconfidently asserted, by the character of Lord Lovat. A general distrust\r\nprevailed, of his motives and of his authority, even in that very\r\ncountry where he had once led on his clansmen to crimes for which they\r\nhad paid dearly in the humiliation and devastation of their clan. He was\r\nindeed, prevented from lingering near the home of his youth, from the\r\ndecrees which had been issued against him, and the risk of discovery.\r\nDisappointed in his efforts, unable to raise even fifty men of his own\r\nclan, and resolved upon gaining influence and favour in some quarter or\r\nanother, he determined upon betraying the whole scheme, which has since\r\nobtained in history the name of the Scottish Plot, to the Duke of\r\nQueensbury.\r\n\r\nIt was on pretext of obtaining a passport for France, that Lord Lovat\r\nnow sought an interview with the Duke in London. He there discovered to\r\nthat able and influential minister, then Secretary of State for\r\nScotland, the entire details of the meditated insurrection, together\r\nwith the names of the principal Scottish nobility concerned in the\r\nconspiracy. The Duke, it appears, perfectly appreciated the character\r\nof his informant. He seems to have reflected, that from such materials\r\nas those which composed the desperate and hardened character of Lovat,\r\nthe best instruments of party may be selected. He consented, it is\r\ngenerally believed,--although historians differ greatly according to\r\ntheir particular bias, as to the fact,--to furnish Lovat with a\r\npassport, and to employ him as a spy in the French Court, in order to\r\nprosecute his discoveries still farther.\r\n\r\nWhen Lovat was afterwards charged with this act of treachery, he\r\ndeclared, that he had told the Duke of Queensbury little more than what\r\nhad escaped through the folly or malice of the Jacobites; but\r\nacknowledged that a mutual compact had passed between him and the Duke\r\nof Queensbury.[179]\r\n\r\nSomerville, in his history of the reign of Queen Anne, remarks, that it\r\nis doubtful whether Fraser of Lovat had ever any intention of performing\r\neffectual service to the Chevalier. \"No sooner had he set foot in\r\nEngland,\" adds the same historian, \"than he formed the nefarious project\r\nof counter-plotting his associate, and betraying the trust which he had\r\nprocured through the facility and precipitate confidence of the\r\nQueen.\"[180]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Queensbury immediately communicated the plot, disclosed by\r\nLovat, to Queen Anne. In the main points the conduct of that able and\r\ninfluential Minister appears to have been tolerably free from blame\r\nduring the inquiry into the Scottish plot which was afterwards\r\ninstituted; but it is a proof of the horror and suspicion in which Lord\r\nLovat was held, that the Duke of Queensbury's negotiations with so\r\nabandoned a tool for some time diminished the political sway which he\r\nhad heretofore possessed in Scotland.[181]\r\n\r\nLord Lovat returned to Paris, where he had the effrontery to hand in a\r\nboasting memorial of his services, written with that particularity which\r\ngives an air of extreme accuracy to any statement. In this art he was\r\ngenerally accomplished, yet he seems on this occasion to have failed.\r\nFor some time he flourished; alternately, one day at Versailles--one day\r\nat St. Germains; and, whilst an under-current of dislike and suspicion\r\nmarked his course, all, apparently, went on successfully with this great\r\ndissembler. The Earl of Middleton, indeed, was undeceived.\r\n\r\n\"I doubt not,\" he writes to the Marquis De Torcy, \"you will be as much\r\nsurprised at Lord Lovat's memorial as we have been; for although I never\r\nhad a good opinion of him, yet, I did not believe him fool enough to\r\naccuse himself. He has not, in some places, been as careful as authors\r\nof romance to preserve probability.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the King thinks proper to apprehend him,\" concludes Lord Middleton,\r\n\"it should be done without noise. His name should not be mentioned any\r\nmore, and at the same time his papers should be seized.\"[182] Such were\r\nthe preparations for the secret incarceration which it was then the\r\npractice of the French Court to sanction.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat was not long in ignorance of the intrigues, as he calls them,\r\nwhich were carried on to blast his reputation at the Court of St.\r\nGermains. In other words, he perceived that the double game which he had\r\nbeen playing was discovered, and discovered in time to prevent any new\r\nor important trust being committed to his command. He fell ill, or\r\nperhaps feigned illness, probably in order to account for his absence\r\nfrom Court; and, although backed by the influence of the Earl of\r\nMelfort, brother of the Duke of Perth, and by the Marquis De Torcy, he\r\nfound that he could never recover the confidence of the Queen Mother.\r\n\r\nHe took the usual plan adopted by servants who perceive that they are on\r\nthe eve of being discarded--he announced his determination to retire.\r\n\"My Lord,\" he wrote to Lord Middleton, \"I am daily informed, that the\r\nQueen has but a scurvy opinion of me, and that I did her Majesty bad\r\nrather than good service by my journey. My Lord, I find that my enemies\r\nhave greater power with the Queen than I can have; and to please them,\r\nand ease her Majesty, I am resolved to meddle no more with any affairs\r\ntill the King is of age.\"[183]\r\n\r\nThere seemed to have been little need of this voluntary surrender of his\r\nemployments; for, after undergoing an examination, in writing from the\r\nPope's Nuncio, and after several letters had passed between Lord\r\nMiddleton and himself, the altercation was peremptorily closed by a\r\n_lettre de cachet_, and Lord Lovat was committed, according to some\r\nstatements, to the Bastille,--as others relate, to the Castle of\r\nAngouleme.[184] Upon this occasion the hardihood of Lord Lovat's\r\ncharacter, which shone out so conspicuously at his death, was thus\r\nexemplified.\r\n\r\n\"As they went along the Captain (by this name he was generally called\r\namong his friends) discoursed the officer with the same freedom as if he\r\nhad been carrying him to some merry-meeting; and, on observing on his\r\nmen's coats a badge all full of points, with this device--_monstrorum\r\nterror_,--'the terror of monsters,' he said wittily, pointing to the\r\nmen, 'Behold there the terror, and here the monster!' meaning himself.\r\n'And if either of the Kings had a hundred thousand of such, they would\r\nbe fitter to fright their enemies than to hurt any one of them.' He took\r\noccasion, also, to let his attendants know of what a great and noble\r\nfamily he was, and how much blood had been spent in the cause of the\r\nMonarchs by his ancestors.\"[185]\r\n\r\nAccording to Lord Lovat's manifesto, he was at dinner at Bourges,\r\nwhither he had been sent on some pretext by the French Government, when\r\n\"a grand fat prevot, accompanied by his lieutenant and twenty-four\r\narchers, stole into the drawing-room, and seized Lord Lovat as if he\r\nhad been an assassin, demanding from him his sword in the King's name.\r\nThe villain of a prevot,\" adds his Lordship, \"was so obliging as to\r\nattend Lord Lovat, with his archers, all the way to Angouleme. He had\r\nthe luck to procure a cursed little chaise, where Lord Lovat was in a\r\nmanner buried alive under the unwieldy bulk of this enormous porpoise.\"\r\nThis relation, so different from that given by Mr. Arbuthnot, weakens\r\nthe veracity of both accounts, and leads one to infer that the long\r\nnarrative by the reverend gentleman of Lord Lovat's adventures in the\r\nBastille were written upon hearsay.[186]\r\n\r\nIn the Castle of Angouleme Lord Lovat continued for three years; at\r\nfirst, being treated with great severity: \"thirty-five days in perfect\r\ndarkness, where every moment he expected death, and prepared to meet it\r\nwith becoming fortitude. He listened with eagerness and anxiety to every\r\nnoise, and, when his door screached upon its hinges, he believed that it\r\nwas the executioner come to put an end to his unfortunate days.\"\r\n\r\nIn this predicament, finding that the last punishment was delayed, he\r\n\"thought proper to address himself to a grim jailoress, who came every\r\nday to throw him something to eat, in the same silent and cautious\r\nmanner in which you would feed a mad dog.\"[187] By the \"clink of a louis\r\nd'or,\" the prisoner managed to subdue the fidelity of this fair\r\njailoress; she supplied him with pens and paper, and he immediately\r\nbegan a correspondence with his absent friends at the French Court.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, the severity of Lord Lovat's imprisonment was mitigated.\r\nThe Castle of Angouleme was, in a manner, an open prison, having an\r\nextensive park within its walls, with walks open to the inhabitants; and\r\nhere, through the influence of Monsieur De Torcy, Lord Lovat was\r\npermitted to take exercise. His insinuating manners won upon the\r\ninhabitants, and the prison of Angouleme became so agreeable to him,\r\nthat he was often heard to say, that \"if there was a beautiful and\r\nenchanting prison in the world, it was the Castle of Angouleme.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, the scheme of invasion was by no means relinquished on the\r\npart of the Jacobites, although it had received a considerable check\r\nfrom the treachery of its agents.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by some historians that scarcely had Lord Lovat quitted\r\nEngland, than Sir John Maclean, his cousin-german, and Campbell, of\r\nGlendarnel, disclosed the plot to Lord Athole and Lord Tarbat. These\r\nnoblemen instantly went to Queen Anne, and accused the Duke of\r\nQueensbury of high treason, in carrying on a villanous plot with the\r\nCourt of St. Germains. Queensbury defended himself before the House of\r\nLords, and the accusation, which rested chiefly on the assertions of\r\nFerguson, the famous hatcher of plots, was declared false and\r\nscandalous, and Ferguson was committed to Newgate. The reluctance of the\r\nDuke of Queensbury to give up the correspondence, excited, however,\r\nsuspicions of his integrity; which, as Harley, Lord Oxford, expressed\r\nit, could only be cleared up by Fraser, Lord Lovat;[188] but Lord Lovat\r\nwas not then to be found.\r\n\r\nIn all this singular and complicated affair, it is impossible to help\r\nwondering at the folly and audacity which Lord Lovat had shown in\r\nreturning to France, conscious of having placed himself at the mercy of\r\nruthless politicians, and aware that in that country he could expect no\r\nredress nor protection from law. But the original crime for which he had\r\nbeen sent forth, an outlaw from his country, was the source of all his\r\nsubsequent mistakes and misfortunes. France was open to him; Scotland\r\nwas closed; and England was a scene of peril to one who trod on fragile\r\nice, beneath which a deep gulf yawned.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat had been two years in prison before any of his former\r\nfriends, for even he was not wholly devoid of partisans, interfered with\r\nsuccess in his behalf; and it was the good, old-fashioned feeling of\r\nkindred that finally moved the Marquis De Frezeliere, or Frezel, or\r\nFrezeau de la Frezeliere, to interest himself in the fate of his\r\ndespised, and perhaps forgotten, relative.\r\n\r\n\"The house of Frezeliere, which ascends,\" says Lord Lovat, \"in an\r\nuninterrupted line, and without any unequal alliance, to the year 1030,\r\nwith its sixty-four quarterings in its armorial bearings, and all noble,\r\nits titles of seven hundred years standing in the Abbey of Notre Dame de\r\nNoyers in Touraine, and its many other circumstances of inherent\r\ndignity,\" was, as we have seen, derived from the same blood with the\r\nfamily of Frezel, or Fraser. In former, and more prosperous days, a\r\ncommon and authentic Act of Recognition of this relationship had been\r\ndrawn up at Paris by the Marquis and his many illustrious kinsmen, the\r\nthree sons of the Marshal Luxembourg de Montmorenci; and executed, on\r\nthe other hand, by Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, and by his brother, and\r\nseveral of their nearest kin.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis De Frezeliere appears to have been a fine specimen of that\r\nproud and valiant aristocracy, not even then wholly broken down in\r\nFrance by the effeminacy of the times. He was haughty and determined,\r\n\"an eagle in the concerns of war,\" and of a spirit not to be subdued. By\r\nhis powerful intercession, checked only by the disgust which Mary of\r\nModena felt towards Lovat, he procured from the King of France\r\npermission for his relative to repair to the waters of Bourbon for the\r\nrestoration of his health. This order was signed by Louis the\r\nFourteenth, and countersigned by the Marquis De Torcy, as \"Colbert.\"\r\nFour days afterwards, a second order was received by the authorities at\r\nAngouleme, by which his Majesty commanded that Lord Lovat, after the\r\nrestoration of his health, should repair to his town of Saumur, until\r\nfurther orders. \"At the same time,\" says Lord Lovat, \"he was permitted\r\nto take with him the Chevalier De Frezel, his brother.\" These orders\r\nwere dated August the second and August the fourteenth, 1707.\r\n\r\nThe brother, whom Lord Lovat always designates as the Chevalier de\r\nFraser, had been placed with a Doctor of the Civil Law at Bourges, in\r\norder to learn French, and the profession of a civilian. He had been\r\narrested at the same time with Lord Lovat; and was now, after a\r\ntemporary separation, permitted to share the pleasures of a removal to\r\nBourbon. According to Lord Lovat, a pension from the French Government\r\nwas settled upon this young man as long as he resided in France; and\r\nLord Lovat received also the ample income of four thousand francs, (one\r\nhundred and sixty-six pounds, thirteen shillings and fourpence,) from\r\nthe same quarter: nor was it in the power of his enemies at St. Germains\r\nto induce Louis the Fourteenth to withdraw this allowance.[189]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Frezeliere continued firm in his regard towards Lord\r\nLovat. On his road to Saumur, Lord Lovat was received and entertained at\r\nthe chateau of the Marquis with hospitality and kindness, and no\r\nopportunity was omitted by which the Marquis could testify the sincerity\r\nof his interest in the fate of his relative. Meantime daily reports were\r\ncirculated that the projected insurrection, far from being abandoned,\r\nhad been revived, and that the Chevalier was going to undertake the\r\nconduct of the invasion in person. But that young Prince was still\r\ninexorable to any petition in favour of Lovat, and was wisely resolved\r\nnot to let him participate in the operations. \"Were he not already in\r\nprison,\" he is stated by Lovat himself to have said, \"I would make it my\r\nfirst request to the King of France to throw him into one.\" This fixed\r\naversion was owing to the determined dislike of the Queen to abdicate,\r\nas it was her resolution, if there were no other person to be employed,\r\nnever to make Lord Lovat an instrument of her affairs.\r\n\r\nLovat, therefore, now clearly perceived that, during the life of the\r\nQueen and of Lord Middleton, he must look for nothing favourable from\r\nthe Court of St. Germains. That of Versailles, although, by his account,\r\ndecidedly friendly to his release, refused to support those whom the\r\nChevalier had renounced. He resolved, therefore, to make every exertion\r\nto return to his own country, and to place himself once more at the head\r\nof his clan, who, in spite of his crimes, in spite of his long absence\r\nand imprisonment, had still refused to acknowledge any other chief. The\r\nattempt was indeed desperate, but Lovat resolved to risk it, and to\r\nescape, at all events, from France.\r\n\r\nTo the vengeance of the Athole family, Lord Lovat always imputed much of\r\nthe severity shown him by the Court at St. Germains: and it is probable\r\nthat the representations of that powerful house may have contributed to\r\nthe odium in which the character of Lord Lovat was universally held. His\r\nown deeds were, however, sufficient to ensure him universal hatred. The\r\ngreat source of surprise is, that this unscrupulous intriguer, this\r\nunprincipled member of society, seems, at times, during the course of\r\nhis eventful life, to have met with friends, firm in their faith to him,\r\nand to have enjoyed, in that respect, the privilege of virtue.\r\n\r\nThe young heiress of Lovat, Amelia Fraser, was now married to Alexander\r\nMackenzie, son of Lord Prestonhall; Mr. Mackenzie had adopted the title\r\nof Fraserdale; and a son had been born of this marriage, who had been\r\nnamed after his grandfather, Hugh. Fraserdale and his lady had taken\r\npossession both of the title and estates of Lord Lovat, during his\r\nabsence; but, since the dignity and estates had always been enjoyed by\r\nan heir-male, from the origin of the house of Fraser, these claimants to\r\nthe estate of the outlawed Lovat spread a report that the honours and\r\nlands had, in old times, belonged to the Bissets, whose daughter and\r\nonly child had married a Fraser, from whom the estates had descended to\r\nthe heir of that line. A suit was instituted against Lord Lovat and, on\r\nthe ninth of March, 1703, Lord Prestonhall, the father of Fraserdale,\r\nhimself adjudged the Lordship and Barony of Lovat to Amelia Fraser. An\r\nentail of the estates and honours upon the heirs of the marriage between\r\nAmelia Fraser and Mackenzie of Fraserdale, was then executed, and the\r\nformer assumed the title of Lady Lovat, whilst her son was designated\r\nthe Master of Lovat.[190]\r\n\r\nLord Prestonhall seems to have acted with the same unscrupulous spirit\r\nwhich characterizes most of the business transactions of those who\r\nintermeddled with the forfeited or disputed estates. It was his aim, as\r\nthe Memorial for the Lovat case, subsequently tried, sets forth, to\r\nextirpate the clan of the Frasers, and to raise that of the Mackenzies\r\nupon its ruins. \"Accordingly,\" says Mr. Anderson, in his curious and\r\nelaborate account of the house of Fraser, \"he framed a deed, with the\r\nsly contrivance of sinking the Frasers into the Mackenzies, by\r\nencouraging the former to change their names, and providing, as a\r\ncondition of the estate, that should they return to, and reassume their\r\nancient name of Fraser, they should forfeit their right.\"[191]\r\n\r\nThe arms of Mackenzie, Macleod of Lewis, and Bisset, were to be\r\nquartered with those of Fraser, in this deed, which bore the signature\r\nof Robert Mackenzie, and was dated the twenty-third of February, 1706.\r\n\r\nThis decision, and the deed which followed it, appeared to complete the\r\nmisfortunes of the disgraced and banished Lord Lovat. But, in fact, the\r\nact of injustice and rapacity, so repugnant to the spirit of the\r\nHighlanders,--this attempt to force upon the heirs of Fraser a foreign\r\nname, and thus to lower the dignity of the clan, was the most\r\nauspicious event that could happen to the wretched outlaw. What was his\r\nexact condition, or what were his circumstances, during the seven years\r\nof his imprisonment, three of which were passed under strict, though not\r\nharsh control, in the Castle of Angouleme, and four, apparently on his\r\nparole, in the Fortress of Saumur, it is not easy to describe. The cause\r\nof the obscurity of his fate at this time, is not that too little, but\r\nthat too much, has been stated relative to his movements.\r\n\r\nIt is always an inconvenience when one cannot take a man's own story in\r\nevidence. According to Lord Lovat's own account, these weary years were\r\nspent in visits to different members of the nobility. The charming\r\nCountess de la Roche succeeded the Marquis de la Frezeliere as his\r\nfriend and patroness, after the death of the Marquis in 1711, an event\r\nwhich, according to Lord Lovat's statement, brought him nearly to the\r\ngrave from grief. The Countess was a woman of a masculine understanding,\r\nand of admirable talents, bold, insinuating, and ambitious. Her\r\neducation in the household of the great Conde, and her long attendance\r\nupon the Princess de Conti, the hero's daughter, had qualified her for\r\nthose arduous and delicate intrigues, without which no woman of\r\nintellect at that period in France might think herself sufficiently\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of the Duke of Hamilton as ambassador at the Court of\r\nLouis, rendered such a friend as Madame de la Roche, who was also\r\ndistantly related to him, very essential for the prosecution of Lord\r\nLovat's present schemes, which were, to obtain his release, and to\r\nprocure employment in any enterprise concerted by the Jacobites against\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nFate, however, relieved Lord Lovat from one apprehension. The Duke of\r\nHamilton was killed in a duel by Lord Mohun, in Hyde Park; and this\r\nfresh source of danger was thus annihilated. The kindness which the\r\nfamous Colbert, Marquis de Torcy, had shown to Lord Lovat, and the\r\npromise which he had given to that nobleman, not to break his parole,\r\nand to return to England, seems to have been the only check to a\r\nlong-cherished project on the part of Lord Lovat to escape to London,\r\nand to risk all that law might there inflict. It is uncertain in what\r\nmanner, during the tedious interval between intrigues and intrigues, he\r\nsolaced his leisure. It has been stated by one of his biographers that\r\nhe actually joined a society of Jesuits,--by another, that he took\r\npriest's orders, and acted as parochial priest at St. Omers. Of course,\r\nin compiling a defence of his life, the wary man of the world omitted\r\nsuch particulars as would, at any rate, betray inconsistency, and beget\r\nsuspicion. His object in becoming a Jesuit, is said to have been to hear\r\nconfessions and to discover intrigues. With respect to the report of his\r\nhaving entered the order of Jesuits, it is justly alleged in answer,\r\nthat no Jesuit is permitted to hear confessions until he has been\r\nfifteen years a member of the society, or, at least, in priest's\r\norders.[192]\r\n\r\nThe rumour of his having become an ecclesiastic, in any way, no doubt\r\noriginated in Lord Lovat's joke on a subsequent occasion, when \"he\r\ndeclared that had he wished it, and had remained in priest's orders,\r\nwhich he did not deny having assumed for some purpose, he might have\r\nbecome Pope in time.\"[193]\r\n\r\nWhilst Lord Lovat, contrary to the advice of Madame la Roche, was\r\ndeliberating whether he should not leave France, he was surprised, in\r\nthe summer of 1714, by a visit from one of the principal gentlemen of\r\nhis clan, Fraser of Castle Lader, son of Malcolm Fraser, of Culdelthel,\r\na very considerable branch of the family of Lovat. This gentleman\r\nbrought Lord Lovat a strong remonstrance from all his clan at his\r\nabsence--an entreaty to him to return--a recommendation that he would\r\njoin himself in an alliance with the Duke of Argyle, who was disposed to\r\naid him; he added affectionate greetings from some of the principal\r\ngentry of his neighbourhood, and, among others, from John Forbes, of\r\nCulloden. This important ally was the father of the justly celebrated\r\nDuncan Forbes, afterwards Lord President. These messages decided Lord\r\nLovat. After some indecision he left Saumur, and being allowed by his\r\nparole to travel to any place in France, he went on the twelfth of\r\nAugust, 1714, to Rouen, under pretence of paying a visit there. From\r\nRouen he proceeded to Dieppe, but finding no vessel there, he travelled\r\nalong the coast of Normandy, and from thence to Boulogne. From that port\r\nhe sailed in a small smack, in a rough sea, during the night, and landed\r\nat Dover, November the eleventh, 1714.\r\n\r\nHe met his kinsman, Alexander Fraser, on the quay at Dover, and with him\r\nproceeded to London. His former friend, the Duke of Argyle, was now\r\ndead; but alliances, as well as antipathies, are hereditary in Scotland,\r\nand John, Duke of Argyle, was well disposed to assist one whose family\r\nhad been anciently connected with his own. Besides, the state of public\r\naffairs was now totally changed since Lord Lovat had left England, and\r\nit was incumbent upon the Government to avail themselves of any tool\r\nwhich they might require for certain ends and undertakings.\r\n\r\nQueen Anne was now dead,--the last of the Stuart dynasty in this\r\nkingdom. Whatever were her failings and her weaknesses as a woman, she\r\nhas left behind her the character of having loved her people; and she\r\nwas endeared to them by her purely English birth, her homely virtue of\r\neconomy, and her domestic unpretending qualities. Her reign had been one\r\nof mercy; no subject had suffered for treason during her rule: she had\r\nfew relations with foreign powers; and when, in her opening speech to\r\nthe Parliament, she expressed that her heart was \"wholly English,\" she\r\nspoke her real sentiments, and described, in that simple touch the true\r\ncharacter of her mind.\r\n\r\nShe was succeeded by a German Prince, who immediately showered marks of\r\nhis royal favour upon the Whigs; whilst the Tories, who formed so large\r\na party in the kingdom, were alienated from the Government by the\r\nmanifest aversion to them which George the First rather aimed to evince\r\nthan laboured to conceal.\r\n\r\nThe Jacobites differed in some measure from the Tories, inasmuch as the\r\nlatter were generally well affected to the accession of the Hanoverian\r\nfamily, until disgusted by the choice of the new administration.\r\nDissensions quickly rose to their height; and when the Government was\r\nattacked in the House of Commons by Sir William Wyndham, the unusual\r\nsounds, \"the Tower! the Tower!\" were heard once more amid the inflamed\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of disaffection quickly spread throughout England; the very\r\nlife-guards were compelled by an angry populace, when celebrating the\r\nanniversary of the Restoration of the Stuarts, to join in the cry of\r\n\"High Church and Ormond!\" Lord Bolingbroke had withdrawn to\r\nFrance--treasonable papers were discovered and intercepted on their way\r\nfrom Jacobite emissaries to Dr. Swift, tumults were raised in the city\r\nof London and in Westminster, and were punished with a severity to which\r\nthe metropolis had been unaccustomed since the reign of James the\r\nSecond. All these manifestations had their origin in one common\r\nsource,--the deeply concerted schemes which were now nearly brought into\r\nmaturity at the Court of St. Germains.\r\n\r\nThe following extract of a letter dated from Luneville, and taken from\r\nthe Macpherson Papers, shows what was meditated abroad; it is in\r\nSchrader's hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Translation.)\r\n\r\n                                         \"Luneville, June 5th, 1714.\r\n\r\n    \"It is likely the Chevalier St. George is preparing for some great\r\n    design, which is kept very private. It was believed he would drink\r\n    the waters of Plombiere for three weeks, as is customary, and that\r\n    he would come afterwards to pass fifteen days at Luneville; but he\r\n    changed his measures; he did not continue to drink the waters, which\r\n    he drank only for ten days, and came back to Luneville on Saturday\r\n    last. He sets out to-morrow very early for Bar. Lord Galmoy went\r\n    before him, and set out this morning. Lord Talmo, who came lately\r\n    from France, is with him, and some say that the Duke of Berwick is\r\n    incognito in this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n    \"The Chevalier appears pensive,--that, indeed, is his ordinary\r\n    humour. Mr. Floyd, who has been these five days at the Court of his\r\n    Royal Highness, told a mistress he has there, that when he leaves\r\n    her now, he will take his leave of her perhaps for the last\r\n    time:--in short, it is certain that everything here seems\r\n    sufficiently to announce preparations for a journey. It is said,\r\n    likewise, in private, that the Chevalier has had letters that the\r\n    Queen is very ill. I have done everything I could to discover\r\n    something of his designs. I supped last night with several of his\r\n    attendants, thinking to learn something; but they avoid to explain\r\n    themselves. They only say that the Chevalier did not find himself\r\n    the better for drinking the waters; that he would now go to repose\r\n    himself for some time at Bar, until he goes, the beginning of next\r\n    month, to the Prince De Vandemont's, at Commercie, where their Royal\r\n    Highnesses will come likewise. They say they do not know yet if they\r\n    will remain in this country or not; that they will follow the\r\n    destiny of the Chevalier, and that it is not known yet what it shall\r\n    be.\"[194]\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Lovat thus precipitately threw himself once more on the mercy\r\nof his country, he could not have been ignorant that the cabals which\r\nhad long been carried on against the Hanoverian succession, were now\r\nshortly to break out in open rebellion; and it was, without doubt, in\r\nthe hope of profiting in some measure during the confusion of the coming\r\ntroubles, that he had hastened, at the risk of his life, to England.\r\n\r\nHe entrusted the secret of his arrival immediately to the Duke of\r\nArgyle, whom he met in London. That nobleman, one of the few\r\ndisinterested men whose virtues might almost obtain the name of\r\npatriotism in those days, saw the danger which Lord Lovat would incur if\r\nhe returned to Scotland. Sentence of death had been passed upon him; it\r\nmight be acted upon by an adverse judge at any moment. He besought Lovat\r\nto remain in England until a remission of that sentence could be\r\nobtained; and for this purpose addresses to the Court for mercy were\r\ncirculated for signature throughout the northern counties of\r\nScotland.[195] To further the success of this scheme, Lord Lovat had\r\nrecourse to his neighbour and early friend, John Forbes, laird of\r\nCulloden, whose after-services in the royal cause, and whose strict\r\nalliance of friendship with the Duke of Argyle, secured to him a\r\nconsiderable influence in that part of Scotland in which he resided.\r\n\r\n    \"Much honoured and dear Sir,\"--thus wrote Lord Lovat to the\r\n    Laird,--\"The real friendship that I know you have for my person and\r\n    family makes me take the freedom to assure you of my kind service,\r\n    and to entreat you to join with my other friends between Sky and\r\n    Nesse, to sign the addresse which the Court requires, in order to\r\n    give me my remission. Your cousin James, who has generously exposed\r\n    himself to bring me out of chains, will inform you of all steps and\r\n    circumstances of my affairs since he saw me. I wish, dear Sir, from\r\n    my heart, you were here; I am confident you would speak to the Duke\r\n    of Argyle and to the Earl of Isla, to let them know their own\r\n    interest, and their reiterated promises to do for me. Perhaps they\r\n    may have, sooner than they expect, a most serious occasion for my\r\n    service. But it is needless to preach now that doctrine to them;\r\n    they think themselves in ane infallible security; I wish they may\r\n    not be mistaken. However, I think it's the interest of all who love\r\n    this Government, betwixt Sky and Nesse, to see me at the head of my\r\n    clan, ready to join them; so that I believe none of them will refuse\r\n    to sign ane adresse to make me a Scotsman. I am perswaded, dear Sir,\r\n    that you will be of good example to them on that head. But secrecy,\r\n    above all, must be keept; without which all may go wrong. I hope you\r\n    will be stirring for the Parliament, for I will not be reconciled to\r\n    you if you let Prestonall outvote you. Brigadier Grant, to whom I am\r\n    infinitely obliged, has written to Foyers to give you his vote, and\r\n    he is ane ungrat villian if he refuses him. [If] I was at home, the\r\n    little pitiful barons of the Aird durst not refuse you. But I am\r\n    hopefull that the news of my going to Brittain will hinder\r\n    Prestonall to go north; for I may come to meet him when he lest\r\n    thinks of me. I am very impatient to see you, and to assure you most\r\n    sincerely how much I am, with love and respect, Right Honourable,\r\n    your most obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                            \"LOVAT.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The 24th of Nov. 1714.\"\r\n\r\nThe nature of the address to which this letter refers was not only an\r\nappeal to the King in behalf of Lord Lovat, but also an engagement, on\r\nthe part of his friends, to answer for the loyalty of Lord Lovat, in any\r\nsum required. It is remarkable that when James Fraser, the kinsman of\r\nLovat, arrived in the county of Inverness, and declared the purpose of\r\nhis journey, the lairds who were well-affected to the nobility, joined\r\nin giving their subscriptions; and the Earl of Sutherland, the Lord\r\nStrathallan, and the nobility of the counties of Ross and Sutherland,\r\nsigned them also. The Duke of Montrose, however, boldly opposed them,\r\nand described Lord Lovat as a man unworthy of the King's\r\nconfidence.[196]\r\n\r\nA year, however, had elapsed, whilst Lovat was hanging about the Court,\r\nbefore the address was brought to London by Lord Isla, brother of the\r\nDuke of Argyle, and afterwards Archibald, Duke of Argyle. The address\r\nwas presented on Sunday, the twenty-fourth of July, 1715. \"The Earl of\r\nOrkney,\" says Lord Lovat, \"who was the lord in waiting, held out his\r\nhand to receive them from the King, according to custom. The King,\r\nhowever, drew them back, folded them up, and, as if he had been\r\npre-advised of their contents, put them into his pocket.\"[197] And with\r\nthis sentence, denoting that the crisis of his affairs was at hand, end\r\nthe memoirs which Lord Lovat either wrote or dictated to others, of the\r\nearly portion of his life.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the Earl of Stair, the English ambassador at Paris, had\r\ndiscovered the embryo scheme of invasion, and had communicated it to the\r\nBritish Court, although, unhappily for both parties, not in sufficient\r\ntime to damp the hopes of the unfortunate Jacobites. On the sixth of\r\nSeptember, 1715, the Earl of Mar set up his standard at Braemar.\r\nConsistent with the usual fatality attending every attempt of the\r\nStuarts, this event was preceded only five days by the death of Louis\r\nthe Fourteenth--the only real friend of the excluded family; but the\r\nJacobites had now proceeded too far to recede.[198]\r\n\r\nLord Lovat resolved, however, to profit in the general disasters. His\r\ninfluence among his clansmen was obvious: whether for good or, in some\r\ninstances, for evil, there is much to admire in the resolute adherence\r\nof those faithful mountaineers, who had resisted the assumption of a\r\nstranger, and invited back to their hills the long-absent and ruined\r\nchief, whom they regarded as their own.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat now found means to represent to the English Government, that\r\nif he could have a passport to go into the Highlands, he might be\r\ninstrumental in quelling the rebellion. The Ministry, in their\r\nperplexities, availed themselves of his aid, and a pass was granted to\r\nhim, under the name of Captain Brown.\r\n\r\nHe once more set out for his own country, and reached Edinburgh in\r\nsafety, attended only by his kinsman, Major Fraser. From Edinburgh he\r\nresolved to proceed in a ship--when he could procure one, for the\r\ncountry was all in commotion. Meantime he took up his abode, still\r\nmaintaining his disguise, in the Grass Market.\r\n\r\nHis real name was soon discovered, and information was given to the Lord\r\nJustice Clerk, who granted a warrant for his apprehension, as a person\r\n\"outlawed and intercommuned;\" and to prevent any difficulty in\r\napprehending the prisoner, a party of the town guard was ordered to\r\nescort the peace officers to the lodgings of Lord Lovat.\r\n\r\nThe officer who had the command of the town guard happened, however, to\r\nbe acquainted with Lovat, and he interposed his aid on this occasion. He\r\nlistened to the account which Lovat gave of the business which had\r\nbrought him to Edinburgh. The Provost was next gained over to the\r\nopinion, that it would be wrong to oppose any obstruction to one who had\r\nhis Majesty's passport: he ordered Lord Lovat to be set at liberty; and\r\nin order to give some colour of justice to this act, he declared that\r\nthe information must have been wrong, it being laid against Captain\r\nFraser,--whereas, the person taken appeared to be Captain Brown.\r\n\r\nLovat was once more in safety: he changed his lodgings, however; and, as\r\nsoon as possible, set sail for Inverness. Again danger, in another form,\r\nretarded his arrival among his clan. A storm arose, the ship was obliged\r\nto put into the nearest harbour, and Lord Lovat was driven into\r\nFraserburgh, which happened to be within a few miles of the abode of his\r\nold enemy and rival Lord Saltoun.\r\n\r\nMr. Forbes, one of the Culloden family, was now fortunately for Lord\r\nLovat, with him on his Majesty's service. After some consultation\r\ntogether, he and Lovat decided to make themselves known to Mr. Baillie,\r\ntown-clerk of Fraserburgh: they did so, were kindly received, and\r\nprovided with horses to convey them to Culloden House, the seat of the\r\nfuture Lord President of Scotland, Duncan Forbes. Here they arrived in\r\nNovember, after incurring great risks from the Jacobite troops, who were\r\npatroling in parties over the country.[199]\r\n\r\nCulloden House, famed in history, was inhabited by a race whose views,\r\nconduct, and personal character present a singular contrast, with those\r\nof Lord Lovat, or with those of other adventurers in political life. The\r\nhead of the family was, at the period of the first insurrection, John\r\nForbes, a worthy representative of an honourable, consistent, and\r\nspirited family. The younger brother of John Forbes was the celebrated\r\nDuncan Forbes, a man whose toleration of Lord Lovat, not to say\r\ncountenance of that compound of violence and duplicity, seems to be the\r\nonly incomprehensible portion of his lofty and beautiful character.\r\n\r\n\"Duncan Forbes was born,\" observes a modern writer, \"of parents who\r\ntransmitted their estate to his elder brother, and to all their children\r\nan hereditary aversion to the house of Stuart, which they appear to have\r\nresisted from the very commencement of the civil wars, and upon the true\r\ngrounds on which that resistance ought to have been made.\"[200] By a\r\nsingular fortune the hereditary estates of Culloden and Ferintosh had\r\nbeen ravaged, the year after the Revolution, by the soldiers of Buchan\r\nand Cannon, on account of the Jacobite principles of the owners. A\r\nliberal compensation was made in the form of a perpetual grant of a\r\nliberty to distil into spirits the grain of the Barony of Ferintosh,--a\r\nname which has become almost as famous as that of Culloden. It was the\r\nsubsequent fate of Culloden to witness on its Moors the total\r\ndestruction of that cause which its owners had so long resisted and\r\ndeprecated.\r\n\r\nDuncan Forbes, who, during a course of many years, was bound by an\r\ninexplicable alliance with Lovat, was at this period about thirty years\r\nof age. He had already attained the highest reputation for eloquence,\r\nassiduity, and learning at the Scottish bar, and during his frequent\r\nopportunities for display before the House of Lords. But it was his\r\npersonal character, during a period of vacillating principles, and\r\nalmost of disturbed national reason, which obtained that singular and\r\nbenignant influence over his fellow-countrymen for which the life of\r\nDuncan Forbes is far more remarkable, far more admirable, than for the\r\nexercise of his brilliant and varied talents. He had \"raised himself,\"\r\nobserves the same discriminating commentator on his life and\r\ncorrespondence, \"to the high station which he afterwards held by the\r\nunassisted excellence of a noble character, by the force of which he had\r\npreviously won and adorned all the subordinate gradations of\r\noffice.\"[201] He adorned this unenvied and unsullied pinnacle of fame\r\nby virtues of which the record is ennobling to the mind. \"He is,\"\r\nobserves another writer, \"in every situation, so full of honour, of\r\ngentleness, of kindness, and intrepidity, that we doubt if there be any\r\none public man in this part of the empire, or of the age that is gone,\r\nwhose qualities ought to be so strongly recommended to the contemplation\r\nof all those who wish to serve their country.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in such society as this that Lord Lovat, by a rare fortune, was\r\nbrought, after his long and disgraceful exile. It was to such a home of\r\nvirtue, of intelligence, of the purest and best affections, that he was\r\nintroduced after a long course of contamination in the lowest scenes of\r\nFrench corruption, which had succeeded an equally demoralising\r\ninitiation into the less graceful vices of the Court of George the\r\nFirst. The inestimable privilege came too late in one sense. Lord Lovat\r\nhad gained nothing but wariness by the lapse of years; but the benefit\r\nto his worldly condition was considerable.\r\n\r\nFrom this time until a few years before the insurrection of 1745, Lord\r\nLovat may be regarded as a jealous partisan of the house of Hanover. No\r\ndoubt, a general survey of the state of society in Scotland would,\r\nindependent of his own personal views, have satisfied him that in such a\r\ncourse was the only chance of permanent safety. The wretchedness of the\r\nstate of things at that period, can scarcely be adequately comprehended\r\nby those who live in times when liberty of opinion is universally an\r\nunderstood condition of civilized intercourse.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for any person who lives now to carry himself back, by\r\nreading or conversation, into the prospects or feelings of the people of\r\nScotland about a hundred years ago. The religious persecutions of the\r\nStuarts had given a darker hue to the old austerity of their Calvinism.\r\nThe expectation of change constantly held out by that family divided the\r\nnation into two parties, differing on a point which necessarily made\r\neach of them rebels in the eyes of the other; and thus the whole kingdom\r\nwas racked by jealousies, heart-burnings, and suspicions. The removal,\r\nby the Union, of all the patronage and show of royalty, spread a gloom\r\nand discontent, not only over the lower, but over the higher ranks. The\r\ncommencement of a strict system of general taxation was new, while the\r\nmiserable poverty of the country rendered it unproductive and unpopular.\r\nThe great families still lorded it over their dependants, and exercised\r\nlegal jurisdiction within their own domains; by which the general police\r\nof the kingdom was crippled, and the grossest legal oppression\r\npractised. The remedy adopted for all these evils, which was to abate\r\nnothing and to enforce everything under the direction of English\r\ncounsels or of English men, completed the national wretchedness, and\r\ninfused its bitterest ingredient into the brim full cup.\r\n\r\nThe events of the year 1715 present but a feeble exemplification of the\r\ntruth of this description compared with the annals of 1745, for the\r\nfirst Rebellion was, happily, soon closed.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat did not hesitate long on which side he should enlist himself;\r\nand the intelligence that his rival, Mackenzie of Fraserdale, had taken\r\nup arms in favour of the Chevalier, decided his course.[202] On the\r\nfifth of November he assembled all those of his clan who were still\r\nfaithful to him, and who had been warned of his approach by his friends.\r\nHe was received among them with exclamations of joy; and, hearing that a\r\nbody of Mackintoshes, a Jacobite clan, were marching to reinforce Sir\r\nJohn Mackenzie, who commanded the castle at Inverness, he marched\r\nforward with his adherents to intercept them, and to prevent their\r\njoining what he then called \"the rebel garrison.\"\r\n\r\nThe citadel of Inverness, built in 1657 by Oliver Cromwell, and called\r\nOliver's Fort, stood on the east bank of the river Ness, and was a\r\nregular pentagon, with bastions, ramparts, and a moat; the standard of\r\nthe Protectorate, with the word \"Emmanuel\" inscribed upon it, had\r\nformerly been displayed upon its ramparts. It was calculated to hold two\r\nthousand men, and was washed on one side by the river. As a fortress it\r\nhad many inconveniencies; approaches to it were easy, and the town\r\nafforded a quarter for an enemy's army. In 1662 it had been partly\r\ndismantled by Charles the Second, because it was the relic of\r\nusurpation, and constituted a check upon the adjacent Highlanders, who\r\nwere then considered loyal.[203] It is said by one who saw it after the\r\nRestoration to have been a very superb work, and it was one of the\r\nregular places for the deposition of arms at the time of the Rebellion\r\nof 1715. Subsequently it was much augmented and enlarged, and bore,\r\nuntil its destruction after the battle of Culloden, the name of Fort\r\nGeorge, an appellation now transferred to its modern successor on the\r\npromontory of Ardesseil.\r\n\r\nIt was against this important fortress that Lord Lovat now marched with\r\nas much zeal and intrepidity as if he had been fighting in the cause of\r\nthat family for whom his ancestors had suffered. He proceeded straight\r\nto Inverness, and placing himself on the west side of the town\r\ndespatched a party of troops to prevent any supply of arms or provisions\r\nfrom approaching the castle by the Firth. Forbes of Culloden lay to the\r\neast, and the Grants, to the number of eight hundred, to the south side\r\nof the town. Sir John Mackenzie finding himself thus invested on all\r\nsides, took advantage of a spring tide that came up to the town and made\r\nthe river navigable, to escape with all his troops; and Lord Lovat\r\nimmediately gained possession of the citadel. The fame of this\r\ninglorious triumph has, however, been divided between Lovat and Hugh\r\nRose of Kilravock,[204] whose brother, in pursuing the Jacobite guard to\r\nthe Tolbooth, was shot through the body. But whoever really deserved\r\nthe laurel, Lord Lovat profited largely by his dishonest exertions in a\r\ncause which he began life by disliking, and ended by abjuring.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth of November Lord Lovat was joined by the Earl of\r\nSutherland; and, leaving a garrison in Inverness, the two noblemen\r\nmarched into the territory of the Earl of Seaforth, where they\r\nintimidated the natives into submission. Lord Lovat also despatched a\r\nfriend to Perth, where the main portion of the Jacobite army lay, to\r\nclaim the submission of his clansmen, who were led by his rival,\r\nMackenzie of Fraserdale. They complied with his summons to the number of\r\nfour hundred, and Lovat, after entering Murray and Strathspey, and\r\nexacting obedience to the King's troops in these districts, prepared to\r\nattack Lord Seaforth, who was threatening to invest Inverness. But\r\nDuncan Forbes, who was then serving with the army, restrained the ardour\r\nof his neighbour, and hostilities were terminated in the North without\r\nfurther bloodshed.[205]\r\n\r\nLord Lovat was quickly repaid for his exertions. From George the First\r\nhe received three letters of thanks, and an invitation to go to Court;\r\nand in March, 1716, a remission of the sentence of death which had been\r\npassed upon him, received the royal signature. He was appointed governor\r\nof Inverness, with a free company of Highlanders. What, perhaps, still\r\nmore gratified his natural thirst for vengeance was the fate of his\r\nrival, the husband of Amelia Lovat, Mackenzie of Fraserdale, who was\r\nattainted of high treason, and whose life-interest in the lands and\r\nbarony of Lovat were forfeited and escheated to the Crown. To complete\r\nthe good fortune of Lovat, the King was graciously pleased, in June,\r\n1716, to make him a present of the forfeited lands; and Lovat\r\nimmediately took possession of the estate, and entered his claim to the\r\nhonours and dignities which were appended to the lands.[206] It was now\r\nthat he added another motto to the arms of the Frasers, and struck out\r\nthe quarterings of the Bisset family, which had been made a plea for his\r\nadversary. The ancient Frasers, or Frizells, had for their motto \"_Je\r\nsuis prest_,\" to which this honour to their house now added the words,\r\n\"_Sine sanguine victor_,\" denoting that he had come peaceably to the\r\nestate.[207]\r\n\r\nHe was now the undisputed Lord Lovat; hitherto he had borne, generally,\r\nthe convenient name of Captain Fraser, given to him in his military\r\ncapacity; and it appears, in spite of all his boastings, that he had\r\nscarcely been called by any other title at the French Court than that of\r\nFraser of Beaufort. He had now an admirable opportunity of obliterating\r\nthe remembrance of his past life, and of conciliating good opinion by\r\nthe consistency and regulation of his present conduct. Notwithstanding\r\nhis crimes his clansmen turned towards him gladly; his neighbours were\r\nwilling to assist him in the support of his honours, and he enjoyed what\r\nhe had never before experienced, the confidence of his Sovereign.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat began his season of prosperity by litigations, which lasted\r\nbetween twelve and fourteen years. His first aim was to set aside the\r\npretensions of Hugh Fraser, the son of Mackenzie of Fraserdale, who\r\nclaimed the title of Lord Lovat after his father's death; and also, by\r\nvirtue of settlements, asserted rights to the estate. The contest was\r\nfinally decided by the House of Lords in favour of Lord Lovat's enjoying\r\nthe honours and lands during his life, the fee remaining with\r\nFraserdale, who died in 1755.\r\n\r\nVexatious and expensive suits occupied the period between 1715 and 1732,\r\nwhen they were brought to a final conclusion.\r\n\r\nLovat now assumed a state corresponding to his station, and suitable to\r\nthe turn of his mind for display. Not only the lands, heritages,\r\ntenements, annual rents, &c., of the unfortunate Mackenzie of Fraserdale\r\nwere bestowed on him for his services in suppressing what in the deed of\r\ngift was termed \"the late unnatural rebellion in the north of Scotland;\"\r\nbut also the \"goods, jewels, gear, utensils and _domecills_, horses,\r\nsheep, cattle, corn,\" and, in short, whatsoever had belonged to the\r\nMackenzies, together with five hundred pounds of money, which had fallen\r\ninto the King's hands. It was, indeed, some time before all this could\r\nbe accomplished, as the correspondence between Lord Lovat and his\r\nfriend Duncan Forbes sufficiently shows.\r\n\r\n                                    \"Inverness, the 5th March, 1716.\r\n\r\n    \"My Dearest General,[208]\r\n\r\n    \"I send you the inclosed letter from the name of Macleod, which I\r\n    hope you will make good use of; for it's most certain, I keep'd the\r\n    M'Leods at home, which was considerable service done to the\r\n    Government. The Earle went off from Cullodin to Cromarty last night;\r\n    and tho' he got a kind letter from Marlbrugh, congratulating him on\r\n    his glorious actions, yet he was obliged to own to General Wightman,\r\n    that his Lordship would have got nothing done in the North without\r\n    my dear General and me. I wish he may do us the same justice at\r\n    Court: if not, I am sure, if I live, I will inform the King in\r\n    person of all that passed here since the Rebellion. The Earle's\r\n    creatures openly speak of the Duke of Argyle's being recalled. I\r\n    could not bear it. You know my too great vivacity on that head. I\r\n    was really sick with it, and could not sleep well since. I expect\r\n    impatiently a letter from you to determinal my going to London, or\r\n    my stay here, where I am very well with General Wightman, but always\r\n    much mortified to see myself the servant of all, without a post or\r\n    character. I go to-morrow to Castle Grant to take my leave of my\r\n    dear Alister Dow. Your brother is to follow and to go with Alister\r\n    to London this week. I find the Duke was gone before you could be at\r\n    London. I hope, my dear General, you will take a start to London to\r\n    serve his Grace, and do something for your poor old corporal; and,\r\n    if you suffer Glengarry, Frazerdale, or the Chisholm, to be\r\n    pardoned, I will never carry a musquet any more under your command,\r\n    though I should be obliged to go to Affrick. However, you know how\r\n    obedient I am to my General's orders. You forgot to give the order,\r\n    signed by you and the other depicts, to meddle with Frazerdale's\r\n    estate for the King's service. I intreat you send it me, for ---- is\r\n    afraid to meddle without authority. Adieu, mon aimable General; vous\r\n    savez que je vous aime tendrement; et que je suis mille fois plus a\r\n    vous qu'a moy-meme pour la vie.\r\n\r\n                                                            \"LOVAT.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter, he observes--\"The King has been pleased, this very\r\nday, to give me a gift of all Fraserdale's escheat.\" Still, however, one\r\nthing was wanting; the rapacious Lovat had not obtained his former\r\nenemy's plate; General Wightman had taken possession of it as from the\r\nperson with whom it was deposited; and he was celebrated for his\r\nunwillingness to part with what he had gained. At last, however, the\r\ngreediness of Lovat was appeased if not satisfied by a present from\r\nGeneral Cadogan of the plate which he had taken, belonging to\r\nFraserdale; and by a compromise with General Wightman, Lovat paying the\r\nGeneral one-half of the value of the plate which was worth only one\r\nhundred and fifty pounds. Thus were the remains of the unhappy Jacobites\r\nparcelled out among these military plunderers.\r\n\r\nDuring this year, the avocations of Lord Lovat's turbulent leisure were\r\npleasingly varied by the cares of a love suit. The young lady who was\r\npersuaded to link her fate to his, was Margaret, the fourth daughter of\r\nLudovick Grant, of Grant; she is said to have been young and beautiful.\r\nBut several obstacles retarded for awhile her union with Lord Lovat. In\r\nthe first place, he was not wholly unmarried to the Dowager of Lovat,\r\nwho was still alive. The family of Athole had, it is true, annulled that\r\nmarriage, yet there were still legal doubts and difficulties in the way\r\nof a fresh bond. Lord Lovat was now, however, according to his own\r\nreport to his \"dearest General\" at Culloden, in high favour with King\r\nGeorge and the Prince of Wales; and to them he broached the subject of\r\nhis marriage.\r\n\r\n\"I had a private audience of King George this day; and I can tell you,\r\ndear General, that no man ever spoke freer language to his Majesty or to\r\nthe Prince than I did.\" \"They still behave to me like kind brothers; and\r\nI spoke to them both of my marriage, they approve of it mightily, and my\r\nLord Islay brother of the Duke [of Argyle], is to make the proposition\r\nto the King; and, so that I believe it will do, with that agreement that\r\nmy two great friends wish and desire it.\"[209]\r\n\r\nHe could, however, do nothing except in a sinister manner; nor was\r\nthere ever one motive which sprang from a right source. Again he thus\r\naddresses Duncan Forbes:--\r\n\r\n\"I spoke to the Duke and my Lord Islay about my marriage, and told them\r\nthat one of my greatest motifs to that design, was to secure them the\r\njoint interest of the North.\" This must have been a pleasing\r\nconsideration for the young lady, but that which follows is scarcely\r\nless promising and agreeable.\r\n\r\n\"They [the Duke and Lord Islay] are both to speak of it to the King; but\r\nIslay desired me to write to you, to know if there would be any fear of\r\na poursuit of adherence from that other person [the Dowager Lady Lovat],\r\nwhich is a chimirical business, and tender fear for me in my dear Islay.\r\nBut when I told him that the lady denyed, before the Justice Court, that\r\nI had anything to do with her, and that the pretended marriage is\r\ndeclared nul (which Islay says should be done by the Commissarys only),\r\nyet, when I told him that the witnesses were all dead who were at the\r\npretended marriage, he was satisfyed that they could make nothing of it,\r\nthough they would endeavour it.\"[210]\r\n\r\nThis letter, which shows in too clear colours how unscrupulous even men\r\nof reputed honour, such as Lord Islay, were on some points in those\r\ndays, seems to have removed all obstacles; and, during the following\r\nyear (1717), Lord Lovat was united to Margaret Grant. Her father was the\r\nhead of a numerous and powerful clan, and this marriage tended greatly\r\nto increase the influence of Lord Lovat among the Highlanders. Two\r\nchildren, a son and a daughter, were the result of this union.\r\nProsperity once more shone upon the chieftain of the Frasers; and he now\r\nrestored to his home, Castle Downie, all the baronial state which must\r\nso well have accorded with that ancient structure. The famous Sergeant\r\nMacleod, in his Memoirs, gives a graphic account of his reception at\r\nCastle Downie by Lord Lovat, where the old soldier repaired to seek a\r\ncommission in the celebrated Highland company, afterwards called the\r\nHighland Watch.[211]\r\n\r\n\"At three o'clock,\" says the biographer of Macleod,[212] \"on a summer's\r\nmorning, he set out on foot from Edinburgh; and about the same hour, on\r\nthe second day thereafter, he stood on the green of Castle Downie, Lord\r\nLovat's residence, about five or six miles beyond Inverness; having\r\nperformed in forty-eight hours a journey of a hundred miles and upwards,\r\nand the greater part of it through a mountainous country. His sustenance\r\non this march was bread and cheese, with an onion, all which he carried\r\nin his pocket, and a dram of whiskey at each of the three great stages\r\non the road,--and at Falkland, the half-way house between Edinburgh, by\r\nthe way of Kinghorn and Perth. He never went to bed during the whole of\r\nthis journey; though he slept once or twice for an hour or two together,\r\nin the open air, on the road side.\r\n\r\n\"By the time he arrived at Lord Lovat's park the sun had risen upwards\r\nof an hour, and shone pleasantly, according to the remark of our hero,\r\nwell pleased to find himself in this spot, on the walls of Castle\r\nDownie, and those of the ancient abbey of Beaulieu in the near\r\nneighbourhood. Between the hours of five and six Lord Lovat appeared\r\nwalking about in his hall, in a morning dress, and at the same time a\r\nservant flung open the great folding doors, and all the outer doors and\r\nwindows of the house. It is about this time that many of the great\r\nfamilies of the present day go to bed.\r\n\r\n\"As Macleod walked up and down on the lawn before the house, he was soon\r\nobserved by Lord Lovat who immediately went out, and, bowing to the\r\nSergeant with great courtesy, invited him to come in. Lovat was a\r\nfine-looking tall man, and had something very insinuating in his manners\r\nand address. He lived in the fullness of hospitality, being more\r\nsolicitous, according to the genius of the feudal times, to retain and\r\nmultiply adherents than to accumulate wealth by the improvement of his\r\nestate. As scarcely any fortune, and certainly not _his_ fortune, was\r\nadequate to the extent of his views, he was obliged to regulate his\r\nunbounded hospitality by rules of prudent economy. As his spacious hall\r\nwas crowded by kindred visitors, neighbours, vassals, and tenants of\r\nall ranks, the table, that extended from one end of it nearly to the\r\nother, was covered at different places with different kinds of meat and\r\ndrink--though of each kind there was always great abundance. At the head\r\nof the table the lords and lairds pledged his Lordship in claret, and\r\nsometimes champagne; the tacksmen, or demiwassals, drank port or\r\nwhiskey-punch; tenants, or common husbandmen, refreshed themselves with\r\nstrong beer; and below the utmost extent of the table, at the door, and\r\nsometimes without the door of the hall, you might see a multitude of\r\nFrasers, without shoes or bonnets, regaling themselves with bread and\r\nonions, with a little cheese, perhaps, and small beer. Yet amidst the\r\nwhole of the aristocratic inequality, Lord Lovat had the address to keep\r\nall his guests in perfectly good humour. 'Cousin,' he would say to such\r\nand such a tacksman or demiwassal, 'I told my pantry lads to hand you\r\nsome claret, but they tell me you like port or punch best.' In like\r\nmanner to the beer drinkers he would say, 'Gentlemen, there is what you\r\nplease at your service; but I send you ale because I understand you like\r\nale.' Everybody was thus well pleased; and none were so ill bred as to\r\ngainsay what had been reported to his Lordship.\r\n\r\n\"This introduction was followed by still further condescension on the\r\npart of Lord Lovat. He looked at the veteran who had served in Lord\r\nOrkney's regiment, under Marlborough, at Ramilies and Malplaquet, with\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\n\"'I know,' said his Lordship, 'without your telling me, that you have\r\ncome to enlist in the Highland Watch; for a thousand men like you I\r\nwould give an estate.' Donald Macleod then, at Lovat's request, related\r\nhis history and pedigree,--that subject which most delights the heart of\r\na Highlander. Lord Lovat clasped him in his arms, and kissed him, and\r\nthen led him into an adjoining bedchamber, where Lady Lovat then lay, to\r\nwhom he introduced the Sergeant. Lady Lovat raised herself in her bed,\r\ncalled for a bottle of brandy, and drank prosperity to Lord Lovat, to\r\nthe Highland Watch, and to Donald Macleod. 'It is superfluous to say,'\r\nadds the Sergeant, 'that in this toast the lady was pledged by the\r\ngentlemen.'\"\r\n\r\nIn contradiction to this attractive account of Lord Lovat's splendour\r\nand hospitality we must quote a very different description, given by the\r\nastronomer Ferguson. Lord Lovat's abode, according to his account,\r\nboasted, indeed, a numerous feudal retinue within its walls, but\r\npresented little or no comfort. It was a rude tower with only four\r\napartments in it, and none of these spacious. Lord Lovat's own room\r\nserved at once as his place for constant residence, his room for\r\nreceiving company, and his bedchamber. Lady Lovat's bedchamber was\r\nallotted to her for all these purposes also. The domestics and a herd of\r\nretainers were lodged in the four lower rooms of the tower, a quantity\r\nof straw constituting their bed-furniture. Sometimes above four hundred\r\npersons were thus huddled together here; the power which their savage\r\nand ungrateful chieftain exercised over them was despotic; and Ferguson\r\nhimself had occasionally the pleasurable sight of some half dozen of\r\nthem hung up by the heels for hours, on a few trees near the house.[213]\r\n\r\nThe pretended loyalty of the chief to the exiled family constituted a\r\nstrong bond of union between Lovat and his followers; and having them\r\nonce under his command, \"that indefinable magic by which he all his life\r\nswayed those who neither loved nor esteemed him,\" to borrow Mrs. Grant's\r\nexpression, caused them afterwards to follow his desperate fortunes. \"He\r\nresembled, in this respect,\" says the same admirable writer, \"David when\r\nin the cave of Adullam, for every one that was discontented, and every\r\none that was in debt, literally resorted to him.\" Lovat, once settled in\r\nthe abode of his ancestors, did all that he could do to efface the\r\nmemory of the past, and to redeem the good opinion of his neighbours.\r\nOne thing he alone left undone,--he did not amend his life. Crafty,\r\nvindictive, gross, tyrannical, few men ever continued long such a career\r\nwith impunity.\r\n\r\nHe was long distrusted by the good of both parties; by the one he was\r\nregarded as a spy of Government, by the other as one whose Jacobite\r\nloyalty was only a pretext to win the affections of the honest and\r\nsimple Highlanders. Yet, at last, he succeeded in obtaining influence,\r\npartly by his real talents, partly by his artifices and knowledge of\r\ncharacter. \"When one considers,\" observes Mrs. Grant, \"that his\r\nappearance was disgusting and repulsive, his manners, except when he had\r\nsome deep part to play, grossly familiar, and meanly cajoling, and that\r\nhe was not only stained with crimes, but well known to possess no one\r\namiable quality but fortitude, which he certainly displayed in the last\r\nextremity, his influence over others is to be regarded as inexplicable.\"\r\nAlthough the most valuable possessions of his family were on the Aird,\r\nthe chief centre of his popularity was in Stratheric, a wild hilly\r\ndistrict between Inverness and Fort Augustus. There he was beloved by\r\nthe common people, who looked upon him as a patriot, and there he made\r\nit his chief study to secure their affections, often going unlooked for\r\nto spend the day and night with his tenants there, and banishing\r\nreserve, he indulged in a peculiar strain of jocularity perfectly suited\r\nto his audience. His conversation, composed of ludicrous fancies and\r\nblandishments, was often intermingled with sound practical advice and\r\ndisplays of good sense. The following curious account of his table\r\ndeportment, and ordinary mode of living, is from the pen of Mrs. Grant\r\nof Laggan, who was well acquainted with those who had personally known\r\nLord Lovat.\r\n\r\n\"If he met a boy on the road, he was sure to ask whom he belonged to,\r\nand tell him of his consequence and felicity in belonging to the\r\nmemorable clan of Fraser, and if he said his name was Simon to give him\r\nhalf-a-crown, at that time no small gift in Stratheric; but the old\r\nwomen, of all others, were those he was at most pains to win, even in\r\nthe lowest ranks. He never was unprovided with snuff and flattery, both\r\nwhich he dealt liberally among them, listened patiently to their old\r\nstories, and told them others of the King of France, and King James, by\r\nwhich they were quite captivated, and concluded by entreating that they\r\nimpress their children with attachment and duty to their chief, and they\r\nwould not fail to come to his funeral and assist in the coranach _keir_.\r\nAt Castle Downie he always kept an open table to which all comers were\r\nwelcome, for of all his visitors he contrived to make some use;--from\r\nthe nobleman and general by whose interest he could provide for some of\r\nhis followers, and by that means strengthen his interest with the rest,\r\nto the idle hanger-on whose excursions might procure the fish and game\r\nwhich he was barely suffered to eat a part of at his patron's table.\r\nNever was there a mixture of society so miscellaneous as was there\r\nassembled. From an affectation of loyalty to his new masters Lovat paid\r\na great court to the military stationed in the North; such of the\r\nnobility in that quarter as were not in the sunshine, received his\r\nadvances as from a man who enjoyed court favour, and he failed not to\r\nbend to his own purposes every new connection he formed. In the mean\r\ntime the greatest profusion appeared at table while the meanest\r\nparsimony reigned through the household. The servants who attended had\r\nlittle if any wages; their reward was to be recommended to better\r\nservice afterwards; and meantime they had no other food allowed to them\r\nbut what they carried off on the plates: the consequence was, that you\r\ndurst not quit your knife and fork for a moment, your plate was snatched\r\nwhile you looked another way; if you were not very diligent, you might\r\nfare as ill amidst abundance as the Governor of Barataria. A surly\r\nguest once cut the fingers of one of these harpies when snatching his\r\nfavourite morsel away untasted. I have heard a military gentleman who\r\noccasionally dined at Castle Downie describe those extraordinary\r\nrepasts. There was a very long table loaded with a great variety of\r\ndishes, some of the most luxurious, others of the plainest--nay,\r\ncoarsest kind: these were very oddly arranged; at the head were all the\r\ndainties of the season, well dressed and neatly sent in; about the\r\nmiddle appeared good substantial dishes, roasted mutton, plain pudding\r\nand such like. At the bottom coarse pieces of beef, sheeps' heads,\r\nhaggiss, and other national but inelegant dishes, were served in a\r\nslovenly manner in great pewter platters; at the head of the table were\r\nplaced guests of distinction, to whom alone the dainties were offered;\r\nthe middle was occupied by gentlemen of his own tribe, who well knew\r\ntheir allotment, and were satisfied with the share assigned to them. At\r\nthe foot of the table sat hungry retainers, the younger sons of younger\r\nbrothers, who had at some remote period branched out from the family;\r\nfor which reason he always addressed them by the title of 'cousin.'\r\nThis, and a place, however low, at his table, so flattered these\r\nhopeless hangers-on, that they were as ready to do Lovat's bidding \"in\r\nthe earth or in the air\" as the spirits are to obey the command of\r\nProspero.\"\r\n\r\n\"The contents of his sideboard were as oddly assorted as those of his\r\ntable, and served the same purpose. He began,--'My lord, here is\r\nexcellent venison, here turbot, &c.: call for any wine you please;\r\nthere is excellent claret and champagne on the sideboard. Pray, now,\r\nDunballock or Killbockie, help yourselves to what is before you; there\r\nare port and lisbon, strong ale and porter, excellent in their kind;'\r\nthen calling to the other end of the table,--'Pray, dear cousin, help\r\nyourself and my other cousins to that fine beef and cabbage; there is\r\nwhiskey-punch and excellent table-beer.' His conversation, like his\r\ntable, was varied to suit the character of every guest. The retainers\r\nsoon retired, and Lovat (on whom drink made no impression) found means\r\nto unlock every other mind, and keep his own designs impenetrably\r\nsecret; while the ludicrous and careless air of his discourse helped to\r\nput people off their guard; and searchless cunning and boundless\r\nambition were hid under the mask of careless hilarity.\"\r\n\r\nBut darker deeds even than these diversified the pursuits of a man who\r\nhad quitted the prisons of Angouleme and of Saumur only to wreak, upon\r\nhis own faithful and trusting clansmen, or his neighbours, as well as\r\nhis foes, the vindictive cruelty of a nature utterly depraved, not\r\nsoftened even by kindness, still less chastened by a long series of\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\nLovat's re-establishment at the head of his clan seems to have\r\nintoxicated him, and the display of his power to have risen into a\r\nruling passion. Above all, he boasted of it to Duncan Forbes, whose\r\nendurance of this wretched ally's correspondence lasted until the\r\npretended friendship was succeeded by avowed treachery to the Government\r\nto which he had professed such gratitude, and to the King and Prince\r\nwhom he was wont to call \"the bravest fellows in the world.\"[214]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this spirit of self-glorification was Lovat's\r\nerection of two monuments,--filial piety dictating the inscription on\r\none of them, that dedicated to his father, and his own audacious vanity\r\nassisting in the composition of the tribute to his own virtues.\r\n\r\nIt was his Lordship's favourite boast that at his birth a number of\r\nswords which hung up in the hall of his paternal home leaped themselves\r\nout of their scabbards, denoting that he was to be a mighty man of arms.\r\nThe presage was not fulfilled, but Lord Lovat's ingenuity suggested the\r\nfollowing means of imposing upon the credulity of his simple clansmen,\r\nby the composition of an epitaph which he erected in the old church of\r\nKirkhill, a few miles from Castle Downie.\r\n\r\n                         TO THE MEMORY OF\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS LORD FRASER, OF LOVAT,\r\n\r\n    Who chose rather to undergo the greatest hardships of fortune than\r\n    to part with the ancient honours of his house, and bore these\r\n    hardships with undaunted fortitude of mind.\r\n\r\n                    This monument was erected by\r\n\r\n                SIMON LORD FRASER OF LOVAT, HIS SON.\r\n\r\n    Who, likewise, having undergone many and great vicissitudes of good\r\n    and bad fortune, through the malice of his enemies, he, in the end,\r\n    at the head of his clan, forced his way to his paternal inheritance\r\n    with his sword in his hand, and relieved his kindred and followers\r\n    from oppression and slavery; and both at home and in foreign\r\n    countries, by his eminent actions in the war and the state, he has\r\n    acquired great honours and reputation.\r\n\r\n              Hic tegit ossa lapis Simonis fortis in armis,\r\n              Restituit pressum nam genus ille suum:\r\n              Hoc marmor posuit cari genitoris honori,\r\n              In genus afflictum par erat ejus amor.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Munro, who was killed at the battle of Falkirk, being on a\r\nvisit to Lord Lovat, went with his host to see this monument. \"Simon,\"\r\nsaid the brave and free-spoken Scotsman, \"how the devil came you to put\r\nup such boasting romantic stuff?\" \"The monument and inscription,\"\r\nreplied Lovat, \"are chiefly for the Frasers, who must believe whatever I\r\nrequire, their chief, of them, and then posterity will think it as true\r\nas the Gospel.\" Yet he did not scruple, when it suited his purpose, to\r\ndesignate his clansmen, the lairds around him, as \"the little pitiful\r\nbarons of the Aird;\"--this was, however, when writing to his friends of\r\nopposite politics to the Frasers, generally to Duncan Forbes.\r\n\r\nThe devotion of his unfortunate adherents can hardly be conceived in the\r\npresent day. In the early part of his career, before his rapacity, his\r\nlicentiousness, and falsehood were fully known, one may imagine a\r\nfearless and ardent young leader, of known bravery, engaging the\r\npassions even of the most wary among his followers in his personal\r\nquarrels: but it is wonderful how, when the character of the man stood\r\nrevealed before them, any could be found to lend their aid to deeds\r\nwhich had not the colour of justice, nor even the pretence of a generous\r\nardour, to recommend them to the brave. But Lovat was not the only\r\nmelancholy instance in which that extraordinary feature in the Highland\r\ncharacter, loyalty to a chieftain, was employed in aiding the darkest\r\ntreachery, and in deeds of violence and cruelty.\r\n\r\nFor many years, Lovat revelled in the indulgence of the fiercest\r\npassions; but he paid in time the usual penalty of guilt. His name came\r\nto be a bye-word. Every act of violence, done in the darkness of\r\nnight,--the oppressions of the helpless, the corruption of the\r\ninnocent,--every plot which was based upon the lowest principles, were\r\nattributed to him. His vengeance was such, that while the public knew\r\nthe hand that dealt out destruction, they dared not to name the man. The\r\nhated word was whispered by the hearth; it was muttered with curses in\r\nthe hovel; but the voice which breathed it was hushed when the band of\r\nnumerous retainers, swift to execute the will of the feudal tyrant, was\r\nremembered. His power, thus tremblingly acknowledged, was fearful; his\r\nwrath, never was appeased except by the ruin of those who had offended\r\nhim. With all this, the manners of Lord Lovat were courteous, and, for\r\nthe times, polished; whilst beneath that superficial varnish lay the\r\ncoarsest thoughts, the most degrading tastes. His address must have been\r\nconsummate; and to that charm of manner may be ascribed the wonderful\r\nascendancy which he acquired even over the respectable part of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nSomething of his ready humour was displayed soon after Lord Lovat's\r\nrestoration to his title, in his rencontre with his early friend, Lord\r\nMungo Murray, in the streets of Edinburgh. Lord Mungo had sworn to\r\navenge the wrongs and insults inflicted by Lord Lovat on himself and\r\nLord Saltoun, whenever he had an opportunity. Seeing Lord Lovat\r\napproaching, he drew his sword and made towards him as fast as he\r\ncould. Lord Lovat, being near-sighted, did not perceive him, but was\r\napprised of his danger by a friend who was walking with him; upon which\r\nhis Lordship also drew, and prepared for his defence. Lord Mungo, seeing\r\nthis, thought proper to decline the engagement, and wheeled round in\r\norder to retire. The people crowded about the parties, and somewhat\r\nimpeded Lord Mungo's retreat; upon which Lord Lovat called out to the\r\npeople, \"Pray, gentlemen, make room for Lord Mungo Murray,\" Lord Mungo\r\nslank away, and the affair ended without bloodshed.\r\n\r\nAn affair with the profligate Duke of Wharton, was very near ending more\r\nfatally. Lord Lovat, during the year 1724, happening to be in London,\r\nmingled there in the fashionable society for which his long residence in\r\nFrance had, in some measure, qualified him. In the course of his\r\ndifferent amusements, he encountered one evening, at the Haymarket, the\r\nbeautiful Dona Eleanora Sperria, a Spanish lady who had visited England\r\nunder the character of the Ambassador's niece. His attentions to this\r\nlady, and his admiration of her attractions, were observed by the\r\njealous eye of the Duke of Wharton, who immediately sent him a\r\nchallenge. Lord Lovat accepted it, replying, that \"none of the family of\r\nLovat were ever cowards,\" and appointing to meet the Duke with sword and\r\npistol. The encounter took place in Hyde-park. They first fired at each\r\nother, and then had recourse to the usual weapon, the sword. Lovat was\r\nunlucky enough to fall over the stump of a tree, and was disarmed by\r\nWharton, who gave him his life, and what was in those days perhaps even\r\nstill more generous, never boasted of the affair until some years\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nLovat lived, however, chiefly in Scotland. Four children were born to\r\nwrithe under his sway; the eldest, Simon, the Master of Lovat, gentle,\r\nsincere, of promising abilities, and upright in conduct, suffered early\r\nand late from the jealousy of his father, who could not comprehend his\r\nmild virtues. This unfortunate young man was treated with the utmost\r\nharshness by Lord Lovat, who kept him in slavish subjection to his own\r\nimperious will, and treated him as if he had been the offspring of some\r\nlow-born dependant, instead of his heir. Still, those who were\r\nwell-wishers to the Lovat family, built their hopes upon the virtues of\r\nthe young Master of Lovat, and they were not deceived. Although forced\r\nby his father to quit the University of St. Andrews, where he was\r\nstudying in 1745, and to enter into the Rebellion, he retrieved that\r\nearly act by a subsequent respectability of life, and by long and\r\nfaithful services.\r\n\r\nBut there was another victim still more to be pitied, and over whose\r\ndestiny the vices of Lord Lovat exercised a still more fatal sway than\r\non those of his son. The story of Primrose Campbell is, perhaps, the\r\nsaddest among this catalogue of crimes and calamities.\r\n\r\nShe was the daughter of John Campbell, of Mamore, and the sister of John\r\nDuke of Argyle, the friend and patron of Duncan Forbes; and she had\r\nbeen, by Lovat's introduction, for some time a companion of his first\r\nwife.[215] Lord Lovat, about the year 1732, became a widower. He then\r\ncast his eyes upon the ill-fated Miss Campbell, and sought her in\r\nmarriage. The match was of great importance to him, on account of the\r\nfamily connection; and Lord Lovat had reason to believe, that whatever\r\nthe young lady might think of it, her friends were not opposed to the\r\nunion. She was staying with her sister, Lady Roseberry, when Lovat\r\nproffered his odious addresses. She to whom they were addressed, knew\r\nhim well: for she entertained the utmost abhorrence of her suitor, and\r\nrepeatedly rejected his proposals. At last, he gained her consent to the\r\nunion which he sought, by the following stratagem. Miss Campbell, while\r\nresiding still with her sister in the country, received a letter,\r\nwritten apparently by her mother, and, beseeching her immediate\r\nattendance at a particular house in Edinburgh, in which she lay at the\r\npoint of death. The young lady instantly set out, and reached the\r\nappointed place: here, instead of beholding her mother, she was received\r\nby the hated and dreaded Lovat.[216] She was constrained to listen to\r\nhis proffers of marriage; but she still firmly refused her assent. Upon\r\nthis, Lord Lovat told the unhappy creature that the house to which she\r\nhad been brought was one in which no respectable woman ought ever to\r\nenter;--and he threatened to blast her character upon her continued\r\nrefusal to become his wife. Distracted, intimidated by a confinement of\r\nseveral days, the young lady finally consented. She was married to the\r\ntyrant, who conveyed her to one of his castles in the North, probably to\r\nDownie, the scene of his previous crimes. Here she was secluded in a\r\nlonely tower, and treated with the utmost barbarity, probably because\r\nshe could neither conceal nor conquer her disgust to the husband of her\r\nforced acceptance. Yet outward appearances were preserved: a lady, the\r\nintimate friend of her youth, was advised to visit, as if by accident,\r\nthe unhappy Lady Lovat, in order to ascertain the truth of the reports\r\nwhich prevailed of Lord Lovat's cruelty. The visitor was received by\r\nLovat with extravagant expressions of welcome, and many assurances of\r\nthe pleasure which it would afford Lady Lovat to see her. His Lordship\r\nthen retired, and hastening to his wife, who was secluded without even\r\ntolerable clothes, and almost in a state of starvation, placed a costly\r\ndress before her, and desired her to attire herself, and to appear\r\nbefore her friend. His commands were obeyed; he watched his prisoner and\r\nher visitor so closely, that no information could be conveyed of the\r\nunhappiness of the one, or of the intentions of the other.[217] This\r\noutrageous treatment, which Lord Lovat is reported, also, to have\r\nexercised over his first wife, went on for some time. Lady Lovat was\r\ndaily locked up in a room by herself, a scanty supply of food being sent\r\nher, which she was obliged to devour in silence. The monotony of her\r\nhapless solitude was only broken by rare visits from his Lordship.\r\nUnder these circumstances, she bore a son, who was named Archibald\r\nCampbell Fraser, and who eventually succeeded to the title. In after\r\nyears, when he frowned at any contradiction that she gave him, Lady\r\nLovat used to exclaim, \"Oh, boy! Dinna look that gate--ye look so like\r\nyour father.\" These words spoke volumes.\r\n\r\nThe character of the lady whose best years were thus blighted by\r\ncruelty, and who was condemned through a long life to bear the name of\r\nher infamous husband, was one peculiarly Scotch. Homely in her habits,\r\nand possessing little refinement of manner, she had the kindest heart,\r\nthe most generous and self-denying nature that ever gladdened a house,\r\nor bore up a woman's weakness under oppression. The eldest son of Lord\r\nLovat, Simon, was a sickly child. His father, who was very anxious to\r\nhave him to his house, placed him under Lady Lovat's charge; and,\r\nwhenever he went to the Highlands, left her with this pleasing\r\nintimation, \"that if he found either of the boys dead on his return, he\r\nwould shoot her through the head.\" Partly through fear, and partly from\r\nthe goodness and rectitude of her mind, Lady Lovat devoted her\r\nattentions so entirely to the care of the delicate and motherless boy,\r\nthat she saved his life, and won his filial reverence and affection by\r\nher attention. He loved her as a real parent. The skill in nursing and\r\nin the practical part of medicine thus acquired, was never lost; and\r\nLady Lovat was noted ever after, among those who knew her, as the \"old\r\nlady of the faculty.\"\r\n\r\nFamily archives, it is said, reveal a tissue of almost unprecedented\r\nacts of cruelty towards this excellent lady. They were borne with the\r\nsame spirit that in all her life guided her conduct,--a strict\r\ndependance upon Providence. She regarded her calamities as trials, or\r\ntests, sent from Heaven, and received them with meek submission. In\r\nafter years, during the peaceful decline of her honoured life, when a\r\nhouse near her residence in Blackfriars Wynd, Edinburgh, took fire, she\r\nsat calmly knitting a stocking, and watching, occasionally, the progress\r\nof the flames. The magistrates and ministers came, in vain, to entreat\r\nher to leave her house in a sedan; she refused, saying, that if her hour\r\nwas come, it was in vain for her to think of eluding her fate: if it\r\nwere not come, she was safe where she was. At length she permitted the\r\npeople around her to fling wet blankets over the house, by which it was\r\nprotected from the sparks.\r\n\r\nShe seems, however, to have made considerable exertions to rid herself\r\nfrom an unholy bond with her husband. Like many other Scottish ladies of\r\nquality, in those days, her education had been limited; and it was not\r\nuntil late in life that she acquired the art of writing, which she then\r\nlearned by herself without a master. She never attained the more\r\ndifficult process of spelling accurately.\r\n\r\nShe now, however, contrived to make herself understood by her friends in\r\nthis her dire distress: and to acquaint them with her situation and\r\ninjuries, by rolling a letter up in a clue of yarn, and dropping it out\r\nof her window to a confidential person below. Her family then\r\ninterfered, and the wretched lady was released, by a legal separation,\r\nfrom her miseries. She retired to the house of her sister, and\r\neventually to Edinburgh. When, in after times, her grand nephews and\r\nnieces crowded around her, she would talk to them of these days of\r\nsorrow. \"Listen, bairns,\" she was known to observe, \"the events of my\r\nlife would make a good novel; but they have been of sae strange a\r\nnature, that I'm sure naebody wad believe them.\"[218]\r\n\r\nBut domestic tyranny was a sphere of far too limited a scope for Lord\r\nLovat: his main object was to make himself absolute over that territory\r\nof which he was the feudal chieftain; to bear down everything before\r\nhim, either by the arts of cunning, or through intimidation. Some\r\ninstances, singular, as giving some insight into the state of society in\r\nthe Highlands at that period, have been recorded.[219] Very few years\r\nafter the restitution of his family honours had elapsed, before he\r\nhappened to have some misunderstanding with one of the Dowager Lady\r\nLovat's agents, a Mr. Robertson, whom her Ladyship had appointed as\r\nreceiver of her rents. One night, during the year 1719, a number of\r\npersons, armed and disguised, were seen in the dead of night, very busy\r\namong Mr. Robertson's barns and outhouses. That night, the whole of his\r\nstacks of corn and hay were set on fire and entirely consumed. Lord\r\nLovat was suspected of being the instigator of this destruction; yet\r\nsuch was the dread of his power, that Mr. Robertson chose rather to\r\nsubmit to the loss in silence than to prosecute, or even to name, the\r\ndestroyer.\r\n\r\nA worse outrage was perpetrated against Fraser of Phopachy, a gentleman\r\nof learning and character, and one who had befriended Lord Lovat in all\r\nhis troubles, and had refused to join with Fraserdale in the Rebellion\r\nof 1715. Mr. Fraser had the charge of Lord Lovat's domestic affairs,\r\nmore especially of his law contests, both in Edinburgh and in London.\r\nWhen accounts were balanced between Lord Lovat and Mr. Fraser, it was\r\nfound that a considerable sum was due to the latter. Among his other\r\npeculiarities Lord Lovat had a great objection to pay his debts. As\r\nusual, he insulted Fraser, and even threatened him with a suit. Mr.\r\nFraser, knowing well the man with whom he had to deal, submitted the\r\naffair to arbitration. A Mr. Cuthbert of Castlehill was chosen on the\r\npart of his Lordship; the result was, a decision that a very\r\nconsiderable sum was due to Fraser. Lord Lovat was violently enraged at\r\nthis, and declared that Castlehill had broken his trust. Not many days\r\nafterwards, Castlehill Park, near Inverness, was invaded by a party of\r\nHighlanders, armed and disguised; the fences and enclosures were broken\r\ndown, and a hundred of his best milch-cows killed. Again the finger of\r\npublic opinion pointed at Lovat, but pointed in silence, as the author\r\nof this wicked attack. None dared to name him; all dreaded a summary\r\nvengeance: his crimes were detailed with a shudder of horror and\r\ndisgust; their author was not mentioned.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat, moreover, instantly commenced a law-suit against Fraser, in\r\norder to set aside the arbitration. This process, which lasted during\r\nthe lifetime of the victim, was scarcely begun when one night Fraser's\r\nseat at Phopachy, which, unhappily, was near the den of horrors, Castle\r\nDownie, was beset by Highlanders, armed and disguised, who broke into\r\nthe house and inquired for Mr. Fraser. He was, luckily, abroad. The\r\ndaughters of the unfortunate gentleman were, however, in the house; they\r\nwere bound to the bed-posts and gagged; and, doubtless, the whole\r\npremises would have been pillaged or destroyed, had not a female servant\r\nsnatched a dirk from the hands of one of the ruffians; and although\r\nwounded, defended herself, while by her shrieks she roused the servants\r\nand neighbours. The villains fled, all save two, who were taken, and\r\nwho, after a desperate resistance, were carried off to the gaol at\r\nInverness; they were afterwards tried, and capitally convicted of\r\nhousebreaking, or _hamesaken_, as it is called in Scotland, and\r\neventually hung. It appeared, from the confession of one of these men to\r\na clergyman at Inverness, that the same head which planned the\r\ndestruction of Mr. Robertson's stacks had contrived this outrage, and\r\nhad even determined on the murder of his former friend, Mr. Fraser. But\r\nthe hour was now at hand in which retribution for these crimes was to\r\nbe signally visited upon this disgrace to his species.[220]\r\n\r\nOne more sufferer under his vile designs must be recorded, the unhappy\r\nLady Grange. In that story which has been related of her fate, and which\r\nmight, indeed, furnish a theme for romance, she is said to have ever\r\nalluded to Lord Lovat as the remorseless contriver of that scheme which\r\ndoomed her to sufferings far worse than death, and to years of\r\nimbecility and wanderings.[221] The subtlety of Lord Lovat equalled his\r\nfierceness; it is not often that such qualities are combined in such\r\nfearful perfection. He could stoop to the smallest attentions to gain an\r\ninfluence or promote an alliance: a tradition is even believed of his\r\ngoing to the dancing-school with two young ladies, and buying them\r\n_sweeties_, in order to conciliate the favour of their father, Lord\r\nAlva.\r\n\r\nHis habitual cunning and management were manifested in his discipline of\r\nhis clan. It was his chief aim to impress upon the minds of his vassals\r\nthat his authority among them was absolute, and that no power on earth\r\ncould absolve them from it; that they had no right to inquire into the\r\nmerits or justifiableness of the action they were ordered to engage in;\r\nhis will ought to be their law, his resentment a sufficient reason for\r\ntaking his part in a quarrel, whether it were right or wrong.\r\n\r\nOne can hardly conceive that it could be requisite for the Frasers to\r\ngive any fresh proof of their obedience and fealty; yet it seems to have\r\nrequired a continual effort on the part of Lord Lovat to establish his\r\nauthority and to keep up his dignity among the Frasers. The reason\r\nassigned for this is, that though they were his vassals, tenants, and\r\ndependants, yet they must be brought to acknowledge his sovereignty;\r\notherwise, when on some emergency he might require their assistance,\r\nthey might assume their natural right of independence, and refuse to\r\nrise. It was Lord Lovat's policy, therefore, to discourage all\r\ndisposition in his clansmen to enter trade or to go to sea and seek\r\ntheir fortunes abroad, lest they should both shake off their dependence\r\non him, and also, by emigrating, diminish the broad and pompous retinue\r\nwith which he chose to appear on all occasions. It was therefore his\r\nendeavour to check industry, to oppose improvement, to preach up the\r\nheroism of his ancestors, who never stooped to the meannesses of\r\ncommerce, but made themselves famous by martial deeds. \"Never,\" thus\r\nargued the chieftain, \"had those brave men enervated their bodies and\r\ndebased their minds by labours fit only for beasts or stupid drudges.\r\nShould not the generous blood which flowed in their veins still animate\r\nthe brave Frasers to deeds of heroism?\"[222]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these exalted sentiments, the chief, who was set\r\nupon this pinnacle of power, hesitated not to retain a hired assassin\r\nfor the purpose of executing any of his dark projects. Donald Gramoach,\r\na notorious robber, was long in the employ of Lovat, who lavished large\r\nsums upon him. At length, in the year 1742, this man was apprehended,\r\nlodged in Dingwall Gaol; and being convicted of robbery, was sentenced\r\nto be hanged. Lord Lovat immediately despatched a body of his\r\nHighlanders to rescue the prisoner; but the magistrates were aware of\r\nhis intentions; the prison was doubly guarded, and the culprit met with\r\nhis due punishment.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat had long thrown off the mask of courtesy, and had laid aside\r\nthe arts of fawning to which he had had recourse before his claims to\r\nthe honours and estates had been fully acknowledged. His tenants now\r\nfelt the iron rule of a merciless and necessitous master; for Lord\r\nLovat's expenditure far exceeded his means and revenue. He raised his\r\nrents, and many of the farmers were forced to quit their farms; but his\r\n_vassals by tenure_ were even more ruinously oppressed by suits of law,\r\ncompelling them to make out their titles to their estates; if they\r\nfailed in so doing, he insisted on forfeiture or escheate; and, in some\r\ninstances, these suits were so expensive that it was almost wiser to\r\nrelinquish an estate, than to be plundered in long and anxious\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nAt last, to prevent their utter ruin, the gentlemen who held lands under\r\nLord Lovat determined upon resistance; after twenty-seven years of\r\nbondage they resolved to free themselves. They met together, and\r\nunanimously resolved to unite their arms, and to deliver themselves by\r\ntheir swords; to this extremity were reduced these brave and devoted\r\nadherents, who had blindly rushed into every crime and every danger at\r\nthe command of their ungrateful chieftain. Their resolution alarmed the\r\ntyrant; he ordered the suits against his vassals to be stopped, and\r\nexcused, as well as he could, and with his usual odious courtesy, the\r\nseverities into which he had been led. He was playing a desperate game;\r\nand the adherence of these unhappy dependants was soon to be put to the\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nHis oppression of his stewards and agents was consistent with the rest\r\nof his conduct. They could rarely induce him to settle his accounts; and\r\nif they ventured to ask for sums due to them, he threatened them with\r\nactions at law. He was all powerful, and they were forced to submit. His\r\ninferior servants were treated even still more oppressively. If they\r\nwished to leave his Lordship's service, or asked for their wages, he\r\nalleged some crime against them, which he always found sufficient\r\nwitnesses to prove. They were then sent off to the cave of Beauly, a\r\ndismal retreat, about a mile from his castle, where they were confined\r\nuntil they were reduced to submission. That such enormities should have\r\nbeen tolerated in a land of liberty, seems almost incredible; but the\r\nslavery of the clans, the poverty and ignorance of the people, the vast\r\npower and influence of the chief, account, in some measure, for this\r\ndegrading bondage on the one hand, this absolute monarchy on the\r\nother.[223]\r\n\r\nThis long-endured course of tyranny had not tended to humble the heart\r\nof him who indulged in such an immoderate exercise of power. The\r\nambition of Lord Lovat, always of a low and personal nature, increased\r\nwith years. He watched the state of public affairs, and built upon their\r\nthreatening character a scheme by which he might, as he afterwards said,\r\n\"be in a condition of humbling his neighbours.\"\r\n\r\nHis allegiance was henceforth given to the Jacobites, and his fidelity,\r\nif such a word could ever be used as applied to him, seems actually to\r\nhave lasted two years,--that is from 1717 to 1719, when a Spanish\r\ninvasion was undertaken in favour of the Pretender. To that Lord Lovat\r\npromised to lend his aid, and wrote to Lord Seaforth, promising to join\r\nhim. But the invasion was then defeated, and Lovat continued to enjoy\r\nroyal favour at home. On this occasion the letter which Lord Lovat had\r\nwritten to Lord Seaforth, was shown to Chisholm of Knoebsford before it\r\nwas delivered, and an affidavit of its contents was sent up to Court.\r\nUpon Lord Lovat becoming acquainted with this, he immediately got\r\nhimself introduced at Court, possibly with a view to deceiving the\r\npublic mind. Lady Seaforth having asked some favour from him, he refused\r\nto grant it, unless she would return that letter, which had been\r\naddressed to her son. With his usual cunning he had omitted to sign the\r\nletter, which he thought could not therefore be fixed upon him. Upon\r\nreceiving it back, Lovat showed it to a friend, who remarked that there\r\nwas enough in it to condemn thirty lords. He immediately threw it into\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\nDuring many years of iniquity, Lord Lovat had preserved, to all\r\nappearance, the good will of Duncan Forbes. That great lawyer had been\r\nLovat's legal advocate during the long and expensive suits for the\r\nestablishment of his claims, and had generously refused all fees or\r\nremuneration for his exertions. The letters addressed by Lovat to him\r\nbreathe the utmost regard, and speak an intimacy which, as Sir Walter\r\nScott observes, \"is less wonderful when we consider that Duncan Forbes\r\ncould endure the society of the infamous Charteris.\"[224] Lovat's\r\nexpressions of regard were frequently written in French. \"Mon aimable\r\nGeneral:\" he writes to Mr. John Forbes, also, the President's elder\r\nbrother.--\"My dear Culloden.\" \"Your affectionate friend, and most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\"\r\n\r\nTo the President, whom he always addressed with some allusion to his\r\nbrief military service,--\"My dear General.\" \"Your own Lovat.\" In 1716\r\nsuch professions as these are made to Mr. John Forbes.\r\n\r\n\"My dearest Provost (we must give you your title, since it is to last\r\nbut short), my dear General's letter and yours are terrible; but I was\r\nlong ere now prepared for all that could happen to me on your\r\nillustrious brother's account: I'll stand by him to the last; and if I\r\nfall, as I do not doubt but I will, I'll receive the blow without\r\nregret. But all I can tell you is this, that we are very like to see a\r\ntroublesome world, and my Generall and you will be yet useful; and I am\r\nready to be with you to the last drop, for I am yours eternally, Lovat.\"\r\nHis frequent style to the President was thus,--\"The most faithfull and\r\naffectionat of your slaves.\" It is indeed evident, in almost every\r\nletter, what real obligations Lovat received from both Culloden and his\r\nbrother; and how strenuously they supported his claim against\r\nFraserdale.[225]\r\n\r\nAt the hospitable house of Culloden he was a frequent guest,--\"a house,\r\nor castle,\" says the author of \"Letters from the North,\" written\r\nprevious to the year 1730, \"belonging to a gentleman whose hospitality\r\nknows no bounds. It is the custom of that house, at the first visit or\r\nintroduction, to take up war freedom, by cracking his nut, as he terms\r\nit; that is, a cocoa-shell, which holds a pint, filled with champagne,\r\nor such other sort of wine as you shall chuse. You may guess, by the\r\nintroduction, of the contents of the volume. Few go away sober at any\r\ntime; and for the greatest part of his guests, in the conclusion, they\r\ncannot go at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"This he partly brings about artfully, by proposing, after the public\r\nhealths (which always imply bumpers), such private ones as he knows will\r\npique the interest or inclination of each particular person of the\r\ncompany, whose turn it is to take the lead, to begin it in a brimmer;\r\nand he himself being always cheerful, and sometimes saying good things,\r\nhis guests soon lose their guard, and then--I need say no more.\"[226]\r\n\r\nIn this hospitable house, a strange contrast to the penuriousness and\r\ndespotic management of Castle Downie, Lord Lovat was on the most\r\nintimate footing. His professions of friendship to the laird were\r\nunceasing. \"I dare freely say,\" he observes in one of his characteristic\r\nletters, \"that there is not a Forbes alive wishes your personal health\r\nand prosperity more than I do, affectionate and sincerely; and I should\r\nbe a very ungrateful man if it was otherways, for no man gave me more\r\nproofs of love and friendship at home and abroad than John Forbes of\r\nColodin did.\r\n\r\n\"As to carrying your lime to Lovat, I shall do more in it than if it was\r\nfor my own use. I shall give the most pressing orders to my officers to\r\nsend in my tenants' horses; and to show them the zeal and desire that I\r\nhave to serve you, I shall send my own labouring horses to carry it,\r\nwith as much pleasure as if it was to build a house in Castle Downie.\"\r\n\r\nEven his wife and his \"bearns\" are \"Colodin's faithful slaves--\" \"I'll\r\nnever see a laird of Culodin I love so much,\" he declares in another\r\nletter;--in which, also, he reminds Mr. Forbes of a promise that he\r\n\"will do him the honour, since he cannot himself at this time be\r\npresent, to hold up his forthcoming child to receive the holy water of\r\nbaptisme, and make it a better Christian than the father. I expect this\r\nmark of friendship from my dear John Forbes of Culodin.\"[227]\r\n\r\nYet all these professions were wholly forgotten, when Lord Lovat, being\r\nfairly established in his honours, no longer deemed the friendship of\r\nthe Forbes family necessary to him. An occasion then occurred, in which\r\nMr. Forbes's \"grateful slave\" showed the caprice inherent in his nature.\r\nForbes of Culloden had long been the representative of Inverness,\r\nchiefly through the interest of Lord Lovat; but when Sir William Grant\r\ncame forward to oppose the return of Forbes, to the dismay of that\r\ngentleman, Lord Lovat turned round, and, upon the plea of consanguinity,\r\nused his interest in favour of the new candidate. The disappointment\r\nresulting from this defeat is said to have preyed upon the spirits of\r\nthe worthy Laird of Culloden, and to have caused his death.[228]\r\n\r\nThe decline of this alliance between the Forbes family and Lord Lovat,\r\nwas the prelude to greater changes.\r\n\r\nIn order to repress the local disturbances in the Highlands, Government\r\nhad adopted a remedy, well termed by Sir Walter Scott, \"of a doubtful\r\nand dangerous character.\" This was the raising of a number of\r\nindependent companies among the Highlanders, to be commanded by\r\nchieftains, and officered by their sons, by tackmen, or by _Dnihne_\r\nvassals. At the period when those great military roads were formed in\r\nthe Highlands between the year 1715 and 1745, these companies were\r\nbetter calculated, it was supposed, to maintain the repose of a country\r\nwith which they were well acquainted, than regular troops. But the\r\nexperiment did not succeed. The Highland companies, known by the famous\r\nname of the Black Watch, traversed the country, it is true, night and\r\nday, and tracked its inmost recesses; they knew the most dangerous\r\ncharacters; they were supposed to suppress all internal disorders. But\r\nthey were Highlanders. Whilst they looked leniently upon robberies and\r\noutrages to which they had been familiarized from their youth, they\r\nrevived in their countrymen the military spirit which the late Act for\r\ndisarming the clans had subdued. Upon their removal from the Highlands,\r\nand their exportation to Flanders, the mischief became apparent; and no\r\nregular force being sent to the Highlands in their stead, those\r\nchieftains who were favourable to the exiled family, found it easy to\r\nturn the restless temper and martial habits of their clansmen to their\r\nown purposes.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat was one of those who thus acted. The Ministry, irritated by\r\nhis patronage of Sir William Grant's interests, in preference to those\r\nof Forbes, at the election for Inverness, suddenly deprived him of his\r\npension in 1739, and also of the command of the free company of\r\nHighlanders. This was a rash proceeding, and contrary to the advice of\r\nPresident Forbes. Lord Lovat, who had caused his clansmen to enter his\r\nregiment by rotation, and had thus, without suspicion, been training his\r\nclan to the use of arms, soon showed how dangerous a weapon had been\r\nplaced in his hand, and at how critical a period he had been incensed to\r\nturn it against Government.\r\n\r\nHe had long been suspected. Even in 1737, information had been given of\r\nhis buying up muskets, broadswords, and targets, in numbers. When\r\nchallenged to defend himself from the imputation of Jacobitism by a\r\nfriend, he insisted upon the services he had done in 1715 as a reason\r\nwhy he should for ever be free from the imputation of disloyalty; and he\r\ncontinued to play the same subtle part, and to pretend indifference to\r\nall fresh enterprises, to his friends at Culloden, as that which he had\r\nalways affected.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody expects we shall have a war very soon,\" he writes to his\r\nfriend John Forbes in 1729--\"which I am not fond of; for being now\r\ngrowne old, I desire and wish to live in peace with all mankind, except\r\nsome damned Presbyterian ministers who dayly plague me.\"[229] Yet, even\r\nthen he was engaged in a plot to restore the Stuarts. In 1736, when he\r\nwas Sheriff for the county, he received the celebrated Roy Stuart, who\r\nwas imprisoned at Inverness for high treason, when he broke out of gaol,\r\nand kept him six weeks in his house; sending by him an assurance to the\r\nPretender of his fidelity, and at the same time desiring Roy Stuart to\r\nprocure him a commission as lieutenant-general, and a patent of dukedom.\r\n\r\nThis was the secret spring of his whole proceeding. It is degrading to\r\nthe rest of the Jacobites, to give this double traitor an epithet ever\r\napplied to honourable, and fervent, and disinterested men. The sole\r\nbusiness of Lovat was personal aggrandizement; revenge was his\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nHenderson, in his \"History of the Rebellion,\" attributes to Lord Lovat\r\nthe entire suggestion of the invasion of 1745. It is true that the\r\nChevalier refused to accede to the proposal made by Roy Stuart of an\r\ninvasion in 1735, not considering, as he said, that the \"time for his\r\ndeliverance was as yet come.\" But, after consulting the Pope, it was\r\nagreed that the present time might be well employed in \"whetting the\r\nminds of the Highlanders, and in sowing in them the seeds of loyalty\r\nthat so frequently appeared.\" In consequence of this, Lord Lovat's\r\nrequest was granted; a letter was written to him from the Court, then at\r\nAlbano, giving him full power to act in the name of James, and the title\r\nof Duke of Fraser and Lieutenant-General of the Highlands was conferred\r\nupon the man who seems to have had the art of infatuating all with whom\r\nhe dealt.[230]\r\n\r\nLord Lovat immediately changed the whole style of his deportment. He\r\nquitted the comparative retirement of Castle Downie; went to Edinburgh,\r\nwhere he set up a chariot, and lived there in a sumptuous manner, though\r\nwith little of those ceremonials which we generally associate with rank\r\nand opulence. He now sought and obtained a very general acquaintance.\r\nFew men had more to tell; and he could converse about his former\r\nhardships, relate the account of his introduction to Louis the\r\nFourteenth, and to the gracious Maintenon. He returned to Castle Downie.\r\nThat seat, conducted hitherto on the most penurious scale, suddenly\r\nbecame the scene of a plenteous hospitality; and its lord, once\r\nchurlish and severe, became liberal and free. He entertained the clans\r\nafter their hearts' desire, and he kept a purse of sixpences for the\r\npoor. As his castle was almost in the middle of the Highlands, it was\r\nmuch frequented; and the crafty Lovat now adapted his conversation to\r\nhis own secret ends. He expatiated to the Highlanders, always greedy of\r\nfame, and vain beyond all parallel of their country, upon the victories\r\nof Montrose on the fields of Killicrankie and Cromdale.\r\n\r\n\"Such a sword and target,\" he would say to a listener, \"your honest\r\ngrandfather wore that day, and with it he forced his way through a\r\nhundred men. Well did I know him; he was my great friend, and an honest\r\nman. Few are like him now-a-days;--you resemble him pretty much.\"\r\n\r\nThen he began to interpret prophecies and dreams, and to relate to his\r\nsuperstitious listeners the dreams their fathers had before the battle,\r\nin which they fought. He would trace genealogies as far back as the\r\nclansmen pleased, and show their connection with their chieftains. They\r\nwere all his \"cousins and friends;\" for he knew every person that had\r\nlived in the country for years.\r\n\r\nThen he spoke of the superiority of the broad-sword and target over the\r\ngun and the bayonet; he sneered at the weakness of an army, after so\r\nmany years of peace, commanded by boys; he boasted of the valour of the\r\nScots in Sweden and France; he even unriddled the prophecies of Bede and\r\nof Merlin. By these methods he prepared the minds of those over whom he\r\nruled for the Rebellion; but in the event, as it has been truly said,\r\n\"the thread of his policy was spun so fine that at last it failed in the\r\nmaker's hand.\"[231]\r\n\r\nThe shrewdness of Lovat's judgment might indeed be called in question,\r\nwhen he decided to risk the undisturbed possession of his Highland\r\nproperty for a dukedom and prospect. But there were many persons of rank\r\nand influence who believed, with Prince Charles Edward, that \"the\r\nHanoverian yoke was severely felt in England, and that now was the time\r\nto shake it off.\" \"The intruders of the family of Hanover,\" observes a\r\nstrenuous Jacobite,[232] \"conscious of the lameness of their title and\r\nthe precariousness of their tenure, seem to have had nothing in view but\r\nincreasing their power, and gratifying their insatiable avarice: by the\r\nformer, they proposed to get above the caprice of the people; and by the\r\nlatter, they made sure of something, happen what would.\" \"Abundance of\r\nthe Tories,\" he further remarks, \"had still a warm side for the family\r\nof Stuart; and as for the old stanch Whigs, their attachment and\r\naversion to families had no other spring but their love of liberty,\r\nwhich they saw expiring with the family of Hanover: they had still this,\r\nand but this chance to recover it. In fine, there was little opposition\r\nto be dreaded from any quarter but from the army,--gentlemen of that\r\nprofession being accustomed to follow their leaders, and obey orders\r\nwithout asking any questions. But there were malcontents among them,\r\ntoo; such as were men of property, whose estates exceeded the value of\r\ntheir commissions, did by no means approve of the present\r\nmeasures.\"[233]\r\n\r\nUpon the whole the conjuncture seemed favourable, and Lord Lovat, whose\r\npolitical views were very limited, was the first to sign the association\r\ndespatched in 1736, according to some accounts, by others in 1740, and\r\nsigned and sealed by many persons of note in Scotland, inviting the\r\nChevalier to come over to that country. His belief was, that France had\r\nat all times the power to bring in James Stuart if she had the will;\r\nthat, indeed, was the general expectation of the Jacobites.\r\n\r\n\"Most of the powers in Europe,\" writes Mr. Maxwell, \"were engaged,\r\neither as principals or auxiliaries, in a war about the succession to\r\nthe Austrian dominions. France and England were hitherto only\r\nauxiliaries, but so deeply concerned, and so sanguine, that it was\r\nvisible they would soon come to an open rupture with one another; and\r\nSpain had been at war with England some years, nor was there the least\r\nprospect of an accommodation. From those circumstances it seemed highly\r\nprobable that France and Spain would concur in forwarding the Prince's\r\nviews.\"\r\n\r\nInfluenced by these considerations, Lovat now became chiefly involved in\r\nall the schemes of the Chevalier. In 1743, when the invasion was\r\nactually resolved upon, Lovat was fixed upon as a person of importance\r\nto conduct the insurrection in the Highlands. Nor did the failure of\r\nthat project deter him from continued exertions. During the two\r\nsucceeding years, and until after the battle of Preston Pans, he acted\r\nwith such caution and dissimulation, that, had his party lost, he might\r\nstill have made terms, as he thought, with the Hanoverians.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1745, Prince Charles despatched several\r\ncommissions to be distributed among his friends in Scotland, with\r\ncertain letters delivered by Sir Hector Maclean, begging his friends in\r\nthe Highlands to be in readiness to receive him, and desiring, \"if\r\npossible, that all the castles and fortresses in Scotland might be taken\r\nbefore his arrival.\"[234] On the twenty-fifth of July,[235] the gallant\r\nCharles Edward landed in a remote corner of the Western Highlands, with\r\nonly seven adherents. Lord Lovat was informed of this event, but he\r\ncontinued to play the deep game which his perfidious mind suggested on\r\nall occasions. He sent one of his principal agents into Lochaber to\r\nreceive the young Prince's commands, as Regent of the three kingdoms,\r\nand to express his joy at his arrival. He sent also secretly for his\r\nson, who was then a student at the University of St. Andrews, and\r\ncompelled him to leave his pursuits there, appointing him colonel of his\r\nclan. Arms, money, and provisions were collected; and the fiery cross\r\nwas circulated throughout the country.\r\n\r\nSuch proceedings could not be concealed, and the Lord Advocate, Craigie,\r\nwrote to Lord Lovat from Edinburgh, in the month of August, calling upon\r\nhim to prove his allegiance, referring to Lovat's son as well able to\r\nassist him, and asking his counsels on the state of the Highlands. The\r\nepistle alluded to a long cessation of any friendly correspondence\r\nbetween the Lord Advocate and Lord Lovat.\r\n\r\nIt was answered by assurances of loyalty. \"I am as ready this day (as\r\nfar as I am able) to serve the King and Government as I was in the year\r\n1715, &c. But my clan and I have been so neglected these many years\r\npast, that I have not twelve stand of arms in my country, though I thank\r\nGod I could bring twelve hundred good men to the field for the King's\r\nservice if I had arms and other accoutrements for them.\" He then\r\nentreats a supply of arms, names a thousand stand to be sent to\r\nInverness, and promises to engage himself in the King's service. He\r\ncontinues,--\"Therefore, my good Lord, I earnestly entreat that as you\r\nwish that I would do good service to the Government on this critical\r\noccasion, you may order immediately a thousand stand of arms to be\r\ndelivered to me and my clan at Inverness, and then your Lordship shall\r\nsee that I will exert myself for the King's service; and if we do not\r\nget these arms immediately, we will certainly be undone; for these\r\nmadmen that are in arms with the pretended Prince of Wales, threaten\r\nevery day to burn and destroy my country if we do not rise in arms and\r\njoin them; so that my people cry hourly that they have no arms to defend\r\nthemselves, nor no protection or support from the Government. So I\r\nearnestly entreat your Lordship may consider seriously on this, for it\r\nwill be an essential and singular loss to the Government if my clan and\r\nkindred be destroyed, who possess the centre of the Highlands of\r\nScotland, and the countries most proper, by their situation, to serve\r\nthe King and Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to my son, my Lord, that you are so good as to mention, he is very\r\nyoung, and just done with his colleges at St. Andrews, under the care of\r\na relation of yours, Mr. Thomas Craigie, professor of Hebrew, who I\r\ntruly think one of the prettiest, most complete gentlemen that I ever\r\nconversed with in any country: and I think I never saw a youth that\r\npleased him more than my eldest son; he says he is a very good scholar,\r\nand has the best genius for learning of any he has seen, and it is by\r\nMr. Thomas Craigie's positive advice, which he will tell you when you\r\nsee him, that I send my son immediately to Utrecht to complete his\r\neducation. But I have many a one of my family more fitted to command\r\nthan he is at his tender age; and I do assure your Lordship that they\r\nwill behave well if they are supported as they ought from the\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThis artful letter, wherein he talks of sending his son to Utrecht, when\r\nhe was, at that time, by threats and persuasion driving him into the\r\nfield of civil war, is finished thus:--\r\n\r\n\"I hear that mad and unaccountable gentleman\" (thus he designates the\r\nPrince) \"has set up a standard at a place called Glenfinnin--Monday\r\nlast. This place is the inlet from Moydart to Lochaber; and I hear of\r\nnone that joined him as yet, except the Camerons and Macdonells.\"\r\n\r\nBut this masterpiece of art could not deceive the honest yet discerning\r\nmind of him to whom it was addressed.\r\n\r\nSince the death of Mr. Forbes, the President had resided frequently at\r\nCulloden, now his own property; his observing eye was turned upon the\r\nproceedings of his neighbour at Castle Downie, but still appearances\r\nwere maintained between him and Lovat. \"This day,\" writes the President\r\nto a friend, \"the Lord Lovat came to dine with me. He said he had heard\r\nwith uneasiness the reports that were scattered abroad; but that he\r\nlooked on the attempt as very desperate; that though he thought himself\r\nbut indifferently used lately, in taking his company from him, yet his\r\nwishes still being, as well as his interest, led him to support the\r\npresent Royal Family; that he had lain absolutely still and quiet, lest\r\nhis stirring in any sort might have been misrepresented or misconstrued;\r\nand he said his business with me was, to be advised what was to be done\r\non this occasion. I approved greatly of his disposition, and advised\r\nhim, until the scene should open a little, to lay himself out to gain\r\nthe most certain intelligence he could come at, which the situation of\r\nhis clan will enable him to execute, and to prevent his kinsmen from\r\nbeing seduced by their mad neighbours, which he readily promised to do.\"\r\n\r\nConsistent with these professions were the letters of Lovat to the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n\"I have but melancholy news to tell you, my dear Lord, of my own\r\ncountry; for I have a strong report that mad Foyers is either gone, or\r\npreparing to go, to the West; and I have the same report of poor\r\nKilbockie; but I don't believe it. However, if I be able to ride in my\r\nchariot the length of Inverness, I am resolved to go to Stratherrick\r\nnext week, and endeavour to keep my people in order. I forgot to tell\r\nyou that the man yesterday assured me that they were resolved to burn\r\nand destroy all the countries where the men would not join them, with\r\nfire and sword, which truly frights me much, and has made me think of\r\nthe best expedient I could imagine to preserve my people.\r\n\r\n\"As I know that the Laird of Lochiel has always a very affectionate\r\nfriendship for me, as his relation, and a man that did him singular\r\nservices, and as he is perfectly well acquainted with Gortuleg, I\r\nendeavoured all I could to persuade Tom to go there, and that he should\r\nendeavour in my name to persuade Lochiel to protect my country; in which\r\nI think I could succeed; but I cannot persuade Gortuleg to go; he is so\r\nnice with his points of honour that he thinks his going would bring upon\r\nhim the character of a spy, and that he swears he would not have for the\r\ncreation. I used all the arguments that I was capable of, and told him\r\nplainly that it was the greatest service he could do to me and to my\r\ncountry, as I knew he could bring me a full account of their situation,\r\nand that is the only effectual means that I can think of to keep the\r\nStratherrick men and the rest of my people at home. He told me at last\r\nhe would take some days to consider of it until he comes out of\r\nStratherrick; but I am afraid that will be too late. I own I was not\r\nwell pleased with him, and we parted in a cooler manner than we used to\r\ndo.\"[236]\r\n\r\nIn all his letters he characterizes Charles Edward, to whom he had just\r\npledged his allegiance, as the \"pretended Prince.\" His affectation of\r\nzeal in the cause of Government, his pretence of an earnest endeavour to\r\narrest the career of the very persons whom he was exciting to action,\r\nhis exertions with my \"cousin Gortuleg,\" and his delight to find that\r\n\"honest Kilbockie,\" whom he had been vilifying, had not stirred, and\r\nwould do nothing without his consent, might be amusing if they were not\r\ntraits of such wanton irreclaimable falsehood in an aged man, soon to be\r\ncalled to an account, before a heavenly tribunal, for a long career of\r\ncrime and injury to his neighbours.\r\n\r\nIf any further instance of his duplicity can be read with patience, the\r\nfollowing letter to Lochiel, who, according to Lovat, had a very\r\naffectionate friendship for him, affords a curious specimen of\r\ncunning.[237]\r\n\r\n                                                              \"1745.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Lochiel,\r\n\r\n    \"I fear you have been over rash in going ere affairs were ripe. You\r\n    are in a dangerous state. The Elector's General, Cope, is in your\r\n    rear, hanging at your tail with three thousand men, such as have not\r\n    been seen here since Dundee's affair, and we have no force to meet\r\n    him. If the Macphersons will take the field I would bring out my\r\n    lads to help the work; and 'twixt the two we might cause Cope to\r\n    keep his Christmas here; but only Cluny is earnest in the cause, and\r\n    my Lord Advocate plays at cat and mouse with me; but times may\r\n    change, I may bring him to Saint Johnstone's tippet. Meantime look\r\n    to yourselves, for ye may expect many a sour face and sharp weapons\r\n    in the South. I'll aid when I can, but my prayers are all I can give\r\n    at present. My service to the Prince, but I wish he had not come\r\n    here so empty-handed. Siller would go far in the Highlands. I send\r\n    this by Evan Fraser, whom I have charged to give it to yourself; for\r\n    were Duncan to find it, it would be my head to an onion. Farewell!\r\n\r\n                                          \"Your faithful friend,\r\n                                                            \"LOVAT.\"\r\n\r\n    \"For the Laird of Lochiel.\r\n        \"Yese.\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most odious feature in this part of Lovat's career was\r\nhis treachery to Duncan Forbes, whose exertions had placed his unworthy\r\nclient in possession of his property, and whose early ties of\r\nneighbourhood ought, at any rate, to have secured him from danger. A\r\nparty of the Stratherric Frasers, kinsmen and clansmen of Lovat's,\r\nattacked Culloden House, as there was every reason to believe with the\r\nfull concurrence of Lovat. Forbes, who was perfectly aware of the source\r\nwhence the assault proceeded, appeared to treat it lightly, talked of it\r\nas an \"idle attempt,\" never hinting that he guessed Lovat's\r\nparticipation in the affair, and only lamenting that the ruffians had\r\n\"robbed the gardener and the poor weaver, who was a common benefit to\r\nthe country.\" Lovat, as it has been sagaciously remarked, the guilty\r\nman, took it up much more knowingly.\r\n\r\nThis tissue of artifice was carried on for some weeks; first by a\r\nvehement desire to have arms sent in order to repel the rebels, then by\r\nhints that the inclinations of his people, and the extensive popularity\r\nof the cause began to make it doubtful whether he could control their\r\nrash ardour. \"Your Lordship may remember,\" he wrote to Forbes, \"that I\r\nhad a vast deal of trouble to prevent my men rising at the beginning of\r\nthis affair; but now the contagion is so general, by the late success of\r\nthe Highlanders, that they laugh at any man that would dissuade them\r\nfrom going; so that I really know not how to behave. I really wish I had\r\nbeen in any part of Britain these twelve months past, both for my\r\nhealth and other considerations.\"[238] The feebleness of his health was\r\na point on which, for some reasons or other, he continually insisted. It\r\nis not often that one can hear an aged man complain, without responding\r\nby pity and sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"I'm exceeding glad to know that your Lordship is in great health and\r\nspirits: I am so unlucky that my condition is the reverse; for I have\r\nneither health nor spirits. I have entirely lost the use of my limbs,\r\nfor I can neither walk nor mount a horseback without the help of three\r\nor four men, which makes my life both uneasy and melancholy. But I\r\nsubmit to the will of God.\" This account, indeed, rather confirms a\r\ntradition that Lord Lovat, after the separation from his wife, sank into\r\na state of despondency, and lay two years in bed previous to the\r\nRebellion of 1745. When the news of the Prince's landing was brought to\r\nhim, he cried out, \"Lassie, bring me my brogues.--I'll rise too.\"[239]\r\n\r\nAt length, this wary traitor took a decisive step. His dilatoriness had\r\nmade many of the Pretender's friends uneasy, and showed too plainly that\r\nhe had been playing a double game. He was urged by some emissaries of\r\nCharles Edward \"to throw off the mask,\" upon which he pulled off his hat\r\nand exclaimed \"there it is!\" He then, in the midst of his assembled\r\nvassals, drank \"confusion to the white horse, and all the generation of\r\nthem.\"[240] He declared that he would \"cut off\" in a moment any of his\r\ntenants who refused to join the cause, and expressed his conviction that\r\nas sure as the sun shined his \"master would prevail.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in the latter part of the summer: on the twenty-first of\r\nSeptember the battle of Preston Pans raised the hopes of the Jacobites\r\nto the highest pitch, and Alexander Macleod was sent to the Highland\r\nchieftains to stimulate their loyalty and to secure their rising. Upon\r\nhis visiting Castle Downie he found Lovat greatly elated by the recent\r\nvictory, which he declared was not to be paralleled. He now began to\r\nassemble his men, and to prepare in earnest for that part which he had\r\nlong intended to adopt; \"but,\" observes Sir Walter Scott, \"with that\r\nmachiavelism inherent in his nature, he resolved that his own personal\r\ninterest in the insurrection should be as little evident as possible,\r\nand determined that his son, whose safety he was bound, by the laws of\r\nGod and man, to prefer to his own, should be his stalking-horse, and in\r\ncase of need his scape-goat.\"[241]\r\n\r\nLord President Forbes, who had been addressing himself to the Highland\r\nchieftains, exhorting the well-affected to bestir themselves, and\r\nentreating those who were devoted to the Pretender not to involve\r\nthemselves and their families in ruin, expostulated by letter with Lord\r\nLovat upon the course which his son was now openly pursuing, pointing\r\nout how greatly it would reflect upon the father, whose co-operation or\r\ncountenance he supposed to be impossible. The letters written on this\r\nsubject by Forbes are admirable, and show a deep interest not only in\r\nthe security of his country, but also in the fate of the young man, who\r\nafterwards redeemed his involuntary errors by a career of the highest\r\nrespectability.\r\n\r\n\"You have now so far pulled off the mask,\" writes the President, \"that\r\nwe can see the mark you aimed at.\" \"You sent away your son, and the best\r\npart of your clan,\" he adds, after a remonstrance full of good sense and\r\ncandour, \"to join the Pretender, with as little concern as if no danger\r\nhad attended such a step. And I am sorry to tell you, my Lord, that I\r\ncould sooner undertake to plead the cause of any one of those unhappy\r\ngentlemen who are actually in arms against his Majesty; and I could say\r\nmore in defence of their conduct, than I could in defence of your\r\nLordship's.\"[242]\r\n\r\nCan any instance of moral degradation be adduced more complete than\r\nthis? The implication of a son by a father, who had used his absolute\r\nauthority to drive his son into an active part in the affairs of the\r\nday?\r\n\r\n\"I received the honour of your Lordship's letter,\" writes Lovat, in\r\nreply, \"late last night, of yesterday's date; and I own that I never\r\nreceived any one like it since I was born; and I give your Lordship the\r\nthousand thanks for the kind freedom you use with me in it; for I see\r\nby it that for my misfortune of having ane obstinate stubborn son, and\r\nane ungrateful kindred, my family must go to destruction, and I must\r\nlose my life in my old age. Such usage looks rather like a Turkish or\r\nPersian government than like a British. Am I, my Lord, the first father\r\nthat had ane undutiful and unnatural son? or am I the first man that has\r\nmade a good estate, and saw it destroyed in his own time? but I never\r\nheard till now, that the foolishness of a son, would take away the\r\nliberty and life of a father, that lived peaceably, that was ane honest\r\nman, and well inclined to the rest of mankind. But I find the longer a\r\nman lives, the more wonders, and extraordinary things he sees.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my Lord, as to the civil war that occasions my misfortune; and in\r\nwhich, almost the whole kingdom is involved on one side or other. I\r\nhumbly think that men should be moderate on both sides, since it is\r\nmorally impossible to know the event. For thousands, nay, ten thousands\r\non both sides are positive that their own party will carry; and suppose\r\nthat this Highland army should be utterly defeat, and that the\r\nGovernment should carry all in triumph, no man can think that any king\r\nupon the throne would destroy so many ancient families that are engaged\r\nin it.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the news of the Pretender's troops marching to England, the\r\nFrasers, headed by the Master of Lovat, formed a sort of blockade round\r\nFort Augustus; upon which the Earl of Loudon, with a large body of the\r\nwell-affected clans, marched, in a very severe frost during the month of\r\nDecember, to the relief of Fort Augustus. His route lay through\r\nStratherric, Lord Lovat's estate, on the south side of Loch Ness. Fort\r\nAugustus surrendered without opposition; and the next visit which Lord\r\nLoudon paid was to Castle Downie, where he prevailed on Lord Lovat to go\r\nwith him to Inverness, and to remain there under Loudon's eye, until his\r\nclan should have been compelled to bring in their arms. Lord Lovat was\r\nnow very submissive; he promised that this should be done in three days,\r\nand highly condemned the conduct of his son. But he still delayed to\r\nsurrender the arms; and, at last, found means, in spite of his lameness\r\nwhich he was always lamenting, to get out of the house where he was\r\nlodged by a back passage, and to make his escape to the Isle of Muily,\r\nin Glenstrathfarrer. Here he occupied himself in exciting all the clans,\r\nespecially his own Frasers, to join in the insurrection. A scheme having\r\nbeen submitted to the Duke of Cumberland, for the prevention of all\r\nfuture disturbances by transporting all those who had been found in arms\r\nto America, Lord Lovat had this document translated into Gaelic, and\r\ncirculated in the Highlands, in order to exasperate the natives against\r\nthe Duke, and to show that that General intended to extirpate them root\r\nand branch. Unhappily, the event did not serve to dispel those\r\nsuspicions. This manifesto, as it was called, was read publicly in the\r\nchurches every Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe march of the rebels to Inverness drove Lord Loudon to retire into\r\nSutherland early in 1746, and President Forbes had accompanied him in\r\nhis retreat. It was, therefore, again practicable for Lord Lovat to\r\nreturn to his own territory; and we find him, before the battle of\r\nCulloden, alternately at Castle Downie, or among some of his adherents,\r\nchiefly at the House of Fraser of Gortuleg, from which the following\r\nletter which exemplifies much of the character of Lovat, appears to have\r\nbeen written.\r\n\r\n                                                    \"March 20, 1746.\r\n\r\n    \"My dearest Child,\r\n\r\n    \"Gortulegg came home last night, with Inocralachy's brother; and the\r\n    two Sandy Fairfield's son, and mine: and I am glad to know, that you\r\n    are in perfect health, which you may be sure I wish the continuance\r\n    of. I am sure for all Sandy's reluctance to come to this country, he\r\n    will be better pleased with it than any where else; for he has his\r\n    commerade, Gortuleg's son, to travell up and down with him; I shall\r\n    not desire him to stay ane hour in the house but when he pleases.\r\n\r\n    \"My cousin, Mr. William Fraser, tells me that the Prince sent notice\r\n    to Sir Alexander Bennerman, by Sir John M'Donell, that he would go\r\n    some of these days, and view my country of the Aird, and fish salmon\r\n    upon my river of Beauly, I do not much covet that great honour at\r\n    this time as my house is quite out of order, and that I am not at\r\n    home myself nor you: however, if the Prince takes the fancy to go,\r\n    you must offer to go along with him, and offer him a glass of wine\r\n    and any cold meat you can get there. I shall send Sanday Doan over\r\n    immediately, if you think that the Prince is to go: so I have\r\n    ordered the glyd post to be here precisely this night.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. William Fraser says, that Sir Alexander Bennerman will not give\r\n    his answer to Sir John M'Donell, till he return about the Prince's\r\n    going to Beaufort; and that cannot be before Saturday morning. So I\r\n    beg, my dearest child, you may consider seriously of this, not to\r\n    let us be affronted; for after Sir Alexander and other gentlemen\r\n    were entertained at your house, if the Prince should go and meet\r\n    with no reception, it will be ane affront, and a stain upon you and\r\n    me while we breathe. So, my dearest child, don't neglect this; for\r\n    it is truely of greater consequence to our honour than you can\r\n    imagine, tho' in itself it's but a maggot: but, I fancy, since\r\n    Cumberland is comeing so near, that these fancy's will be out of\r\n    head. However, I beg you may not neglect to acquaint me (if it was\r\n    by ane express) when you are rightly informed that the Prince is\r\n    going. I have been extreamly bad these four days past with a fever\r\n    and a cough; but I thank God I am better since yesterday affernoon.\r\n    I shall be glad to see you here, if you think it proper for as short\r\n    or as long a time as you please. All in this family offer you their\r\n    compliments: and I ever am, more than I can express, my dearest\r\n    child, your most affected and dutiful father,\r\n\r\n                                                             \"----.\"\r\n\r\n    \"P.S.--The Prince's reason for going to my house is, to see a salmon\r\n    kill'd with the rod, which he never saw before; and if he proposes\r\n    that fancy, he must not be disappointed.\r\n\r\n    \"I long to hear from you by the glyd post some time this night. I\r\n    beg, my dear child, you may send me any news you have from the east,\r\n    and from the north, and from the south.\"[243]\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the battle of Culloden that Charles Edward and\r\nLord Lovat first met. In that engagement, Lovat's infirmities, as well\r\nas his precautions, had prevented his taking an active part; but his\r\nson, the Master of Lovat, whose energy in the cause which he had\r\nunwillingly espoused, met the praise of Prince Charles, led his clan up\r\nto the encounter, and was one of the few who effected a junction with\r\nthe Prince on the morning of the battle. Fresh auxiliaries from the clan\r\nFraser were hastening in at the very moment of that ill-judged action;\r\nand they behaved with their accustomed bravery, and were permitted to\r\nmarch off unattacked, with their pipes playing, and their colours\r\nflying. The great body of the clan Fraser were led by Charles Fraser,\r\njunior, of Inverlaltochy, as Lieutenant-Colonel in the absence of the\r\nMaster of Lovat, who was coming up with three hundred men, but met the\r\nHighlanders flying. The brave Inverlaltochy was killed; and the\r\nfugitives were sorely harassed by Kingston's light horse.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Culloden occurring shortly afterwards, decided the\r\nquestion of Lord Lovat's political bias. Very different accounts have\r\nbeen transmitted of the feelings and conduct of Prince Charles after\r\nthe fury of the contest had been decided. By some it has been stated,\r\nthat he lost on that sad occasion those claims to a character for valour\r\nwhich even his enemies had not hitherto refused him; but Mr. Maxwell has\r\njustified the unfortunate and inexperienced young man.\r\n\r\n\"The Prince,\" he says, \"seeing his army entirely routed, and all his\r\nendeavours to rally the men fruitless, was at last prevailed upon to\r\nretire. Most of his horse assembled around his person to secure his\r\nretreat, which was made without any danger, for the enemy advanced very\r\nleisurely over the ground. They were too happy to have got so cheap a\r\nvictory over a Prince and an enemy that they had so much reason to\r\ndread. They made no attack where there was any body of the Prince's men\r\ntogether, but contented themselves with sabering such unfortunate people\r\nas fell in his way single and disarmed.\"[244]\r\n\r\n\"If he did less at Culloden than was expected from him,\" adds this\r\npartial, but honest follower, \"'twas only because he had formerly done\r\nmore than could be expected.\" He justly blames the Prince's having come\r\nover without any officer of experience to guide him. \"He was too young\r\nhimself, and had too little experience to perform all the functions of a\r\ngeneral; and though there are examples of princes that seem to have been\r\nborn generals, they had the advice and assistance of old experienced\r\nofficers, men that understood, in detail, all that belongs to any\r\narmy.\"[245]\r\n\r\nLord Elcho, in his manuscript, thus accounts for the censures which\r\nwere cast upon the Prince by those who shared his misfortunes.\r\n\r\n\"What displeased the people of fashion (consequence) was, that he did\r\nnot seem to have the least sense of what they had done for him; but,\r\nafter all, would afterwards say they had done nothing but their duty, as\r\nhis father's subjects were bound to do.\r\n\r\n\"And there were people about him that took advantage to represent the\r\nScotch to him as a mutinous people, and that it was not so much for him\r\nthey were fighting as for themselves; and repeated to him all their bad\r\nbehaviour to Charles the First and Charles the Second, and put it to him\r\nin the worst light, that at the battle of Culloden he thought that all\r\nthe Scots in general were a parcel of traitors. And he would have\r\ncontinued in the same mind had he got out of the country immediately;\r\nbut the care they took of his person when he was hiding made him change\r\nhis mind, and affix treason only to particulars.\"[246]\r\n\r\nAfter the battle was decided, and the plain of Culloden abandoned to the\r\nfury of an enemy more merciless and insatiable than any who ever before\r\nor after answered to an English name, the Prince retired across a moor\r\nin the direction of Fort Augustus, and, according to Maxwell, slept that\r\nnight at the house of Fraser of Gortuleg; and there for the first time\r\nsaw Lord Lovat. But this interview is declared by Arbuthnot, who appears\r\nto have gathered his facts chiefly from local information, in the\r\nCastle of Downie; and the testimony of Sir Walter Scott confirms the\r\nassertion. \"A lady,\" writes Sir Walter, \"who, then a girl, was residing\r\nin Lord Lovat's family, described to us the unexpected appearance of\r\nPrince Charles and his flying attendants at Castle Downie. The wild and\r\ndesolate vale on which she was gazing with indolent composure, was at\r\nonce so suddenly filled with horsemen riding furiously towards the\r\nCastle, that, impressed with the idea that they were fairies, who,\r\naccording to men, are visible only from one twinkle of the eyelid to\r\nanother, she strove to refrain from the vibration which she believed\r\nwould occasion the strange and magnificent apparition to become\r\ninvisible. To Lord Lovat it brought a certainty more dreadful than the\r\npresence of fairies or even demons. The tower on which he had depended\r\nhad fallen to crush him, and he only met the Chevalier to exchange\r\nmutual condolences.\"[247]\r\n\r\nThe Prince, it is affirmed, rushed into the chamber where Lovat,\r\nsupported by men, for he could not stand without assistance, awaited his\r\napproach. The unhappy fugitive broke into lamentations. \"My Lord,\" he\r\nexclaimed, \"we are undone; my army is routed: what will become of poor\r\nScotland?\" Unable to utter any more, he sank fainting on a bed near him.\r\nLord Lovat immediately summoned assistance, and by proper remedies the\r\nPrince was restored to a consciousness of his misfortunes, and to the\r\nrecollection that Castle Downie, a spot upon which the vengeance of the\r\nGovernment was sure to fall, could be no safe abiding place for him or\r\nfor his followers.[248]\r\n\r\nSuch was the commencement of those wanderings, to the interest and\r\nromance of which no fiction can add. After this conference was ended,\r\nPrince Charles went to Invergarie; Lord Lovat prepared for flight.\r\n\r\nHis first place of retreat was to a mountain, whence he could behold the\r\nfield of battle; he collected his officers and men around him, and they\r\ngazed with mournful interest upon the plain of Culloden. Heaps of\r\nwounded men were lying in their blood; others were still pursued by the\r\nsoldiers of an army whose orders were, from their royal General, _to\r\ngive no quarter_; fire and sword were everywhere; vengeance and fury\r\nraged on the moor watered by the river Nairn. Here, too, the unhappy\r\nFrasers and their chief might view Culloden House, a large fabric of\r\nstone, graced with a noble avenue of great length leading to the house,\r\nand surrounded by a park covered with heather. Here Charles Edward had\r\nslept the night before the battle. The remembrance of many social hours,\r\nof the hospitality of that old hall, might recur at this moment to the\r\nmind of Lovat. But whatever might be his reflections, his fortitude\r\nremained unbroken. He turned to the sorrowful clan around them, and\r\naddressed them. He recurred to his former predictions: \"I have\r\nforetold,\" he said, still attempting to keep up his old influence over\r\nthe minds of his clans, \"that our enemies would destroy us with the fire\r\nand sword; they have begun with me, nor will they cease until they have\r\nravaged all the country.\" He still, however, exhorted his captains to\r\nkeep together their men, and to maintain a mountain war, so that at\r\nleast they might obtain better terms of peace. Having thus counselled\r\nthem, he was carried upon the shoulders of his followers to the still\r\nfarther mountains, from one of which he is said, by a singular stroke of\r\nretributive justice, to have beheld Castle Downie, the scene of his\r\ncrime, to maintain the splendour of which he had sacrificed every\r\nprinciple, and compassed every crime, burned by the infuriated enemy.\r\nNine hundred men, under Brigadier Mordaunt, were detached for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIn one of the Highland fastnesses Lovat remained some time; but the\r\nblood-thirsty Cumberland was eager in pursuit. Parties of soldiers were\r\nsent out in search of Lovat, and he soon found that it was no longer\r\nsafe to remain in the vicinity of Beaufort. He fled, in the first\r\ninstance, to Cawdor Castle. In this famous structure, with its\r\niron-grated doors, its ancient tapestry hanging over secret passages and\r\nobscure approaches, he took refuge. In one of its towers, in a small low\r\nchamber beneath the roof, the wretched old man concealed himself for\r\nsome months. When he was at last obliged to quit it, he descended by\r\nmeans of a rope from his chamber.\r\n\r\nHe had still lost neither resolution nor energy. On the fourth of May,\r\nfifteen of the Jacobite chieftains, Lord Lovat among the number, met in\r\nthe Island of Mortlaig, to concert measures for raising a body of men\r\nto resist the victorious troops. On this occasion Lord Lovat declared\r\nthat they need not be uneasy, since he had no doubt but that they should\r\nbe able to collect eight or ten thousand men to fight the Elector of\r\nHanover's troops. Cameron of Lochiel, Murray of Broughton, and several\r\nother leaders of distinction were present; Lord Lovat was attended by\r\nmany of his own clan, who were armed with dirks, swords, and pistols,\r\nand marked by wearing sprays of yew in their bonnets. But the conference\r\nbroke up without any important result. The leaders embraced each other,\r\ndrank to Prince Charles's health, and separated. On this occasion Lord\r\nLovat headed that party among the Jacobites who still looked for aid\r\nfrom France, and abjured the notion of surrendering to the\r\nconqueror.[249] Still hunted, to use his own expression, \"like a fox,\"\r\nthrough the main land, Lovat now got off in a boat to the Island of\r\nMorar, where he thought himself secure from his enemies; but it was\r\ndecreed that his iniquitous life should not close in peaceful obscurity.\r\nIt was not long before he heard that a party of the King's troops had\r\narrived in pursuit of him, and a detachment of the garrison of Fort\r\nWilliam, on board the Terror and Furnace sloops, was also despatched, to\r\nmake descents on different parts of the island. Lovat retreated into the\r\nwoods; Captain Mellon, who commanded the detachment searched every town,\r\nvillage, and house; but not finding the fugitive, he resolved to\r\ntraverse the woods, planting parties at the openings to intercept an\r\nescape. In the course of his researches he passed a very old tree,\r\nwhich, from some slits in its trunk, he and his men perceived to be\r\nhollow. One of the soldiers, peeping into the aperture, thought he saw a\r\nman's leg; upon which he summoned his captain, who, on investigating\r\nfarther, found on one side a large opening, in which stood a pair of\r\nlegs, the rest of the figure being hidden within the hollow of the tree.\r\nThis was, however, quickly discovered to be Lord Lovat, for whom this\r\nparty had then been three days in search. He was wrapped in blankets, to\r\nprotect his aged limbs from the cold.\r\n\r\nThus discovered, Lovat was forced to surrender, but his spirit rose with\r\nthe occasion: he told Captain Mellon that \"he had best take care of him;\r\nfor if he did not, he should make him answer for his conduct before a\r\nset of gentlemen the very sight of whom would make him tremble.\" He was\r\ntaken, in the first instance, to Fort William, where he was treated with\r\nhumanity, in obedience to the express orders of the Duke of Cumberland.\r\nFrom this prison Lovat wrote a letter to the Duke, reminding his Royal\r\nHighness of the services which he had performed in 1715, and of the\r\nfavour shown him by George the First. \"I often carried your Royal\r\nHighness,\" pursues the unhappy old man, \"in my arms, in the palaces of\r\nKensington and of Hampton Court, to hold you up to your royal\r\ngrandfather, that he might embrace you, for he was very fond of you and\r\nthe young princesses.\" He then represented to the Duke that if mercy\r\nwere shown him, and he \"might have the honour to kiss the Duke's hand,\r\nhe might do more service to the King and Government than destroying a\r\nhundred such old and very infirm men like me, (past seventy, without the\r\nleast use of my hands, legs, or knees,) can be of advantage in any shape\r\nto the Government.\"\r\n\r\nHe was conveyed soon after this letter, which is dated June the\r\ntwenty-second, 1746, to Fort Augustus. He had requested that a litter\r\nmight be prepared for him, for he was not able either to stand, walk, or\r\nride. On the fifteenth of July he was removed, under a strong guard, to\r\nStirling, where a party of Lord Mark Ker's dragoons received him. After\r\na few days rest he passed through Edinburgh for the last time; thence to\r\nBerwick, and on the twenty-fifth he began his last journey under the\r\nescort of sixty dragoons commanded by Major Gardner. His journey to\r\nLondon was divided into twenty stages, and he was to travel one stage a\r\nday. It was, indeed, of importance to the Government that he should\r\nreach London alive, since many disclosures were expected from Lovat. On\r\nreaching Newcastle three days afterwards he appeared to be in a very\r\nfeeble state, and walked from his coach to his lodgings supported by two\r\nof the dragoons. As he travelled along in a sort of cage, or\r\nhorse-litter, the acclamations and hisses of the populace everywhere\r\nassailed him; but his spirits were unbroken, and he talked confidently\r\nof his return.\r\n\r\nBut as he drew near London this security diminished. He happened to\r\nreach London a few days before the unhappy Jacobite noblemen were\r\nbeheaded on Tower Hill. On his way to the Tower he passed the scaffold\r\nwhich was erected for their execution. \"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"I suppose it\r\nwill not be long before I shall make my exit there.\"\r\n\r\nHe was received in the Tower by the Lieutenant-Governor, who conducted\r\nhim to the apartment prepared for his reception. Here, reclining in an\r\nelbow chair, he is said to have broken out into reflections upon his\r\neventful and singular career. He uttered many moral sentiments, and\r\nexpressed himself, as many other men have done on similar occasions,\r\nperfectly satisfied with his own intentions. Such was the self-deception\r\nof this extraordinary man.[250]\r\n\r\nIn this prison Lovat remained during five months without being brought\r\nto trial. But the delay was of infinite importance; it prepared him to\r\nquit, with what may be almost termed heroism, a life which he had\r\nemployed in iniquity. Without remembering this interval, during which\r\nample time for preparation had been afforded, the hardihood which could\r\nsport with the most solemn of all subjects, would shock rather than\r\nastonish. In consideration of the conduct of many of our state prisoners\r\non the scaffold, we must recollect how familiarized they had previously\r\nbecome with death, in those gloomy chambers whence they could see many a\r\nfellow sufferer issue, to shed his blood on the same scaffold which\r\nwould soon be re-erected for themselves.\r\n\r\nDuring his imprisonment, Lovat had the affliction of hearing that his\r\nestates, after being plundered of everything and destroyed by fire,\r\nwere given by the Duke of Cumberland to James Fraser of Cullen\r\nCastle.[251] He was therefore left without a shilling of revenue during\r\nhis confinement, and was thus treated as a convicted prisoner. In this\r\nsituation he was reduced to the utmost distress, and indebted solely to\r\nthe bounty of a kinsman, administered through Governor Williamson, for\r\nsubsistence. At length, early in the year 1747, upon preferring a\r\npetition to the House of Lords, these grievances were in a great measure\r\nredressed. Yet the unhappy prisoner had sustained many hardships. Among\r\nothers the legal plunder of his strong box, containing the sum of seven\r\nhundred pounds, and of many valuables.[252]\r\n\r\nAfter much deliberation on the part of the Crown lawyers, Lord Lovat was\r\nimpeached of high treason. \"We learn,\" says Mr. Anderson, \"from Lord\r\nMansfield's speech in the Sutherland cause, that much deliberation was\r\nnecessary. It was foreseen that his Lordship would have recourse to art.\r\nIf he was tried as a commoner he might claim to be a peer; if tried as a\r\npeer he might claim to be a commoner. Everything was fully considered;\r\nthe true solid ground upon which he was tried as a peer, was the\r\npresumption in favour of the heirs male.\"[253]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the ninth of March, the proceedings were commenced against\r\nLord Lovat; and a renewal took place of that scene which Horace Walpole\r\ndeclared to be \"most solemn and fine;--a coronation is a puppet-show,\r\nand all the splendour of it idle; but this sight at once feasted the\r\neyes, and engaged all one's passions.\"\r\n\r\nLord Lovat was now dragged forth to play the last scene of his eventful\r\nlife. His size had by this time become enormous, so that when he had\r\nfirst entered the Tower it was jestingly said that the doors must be\r\nenlarged to receive him. He could neither walk nor ride, as he was\r\nalmost helpless; he was deaf, purblind, eighty years of age, ignorant of\r\nEnglish law, and it was therefore not a matter of surprise that the\r\nhigh-born tribes, who thronged to his trial, were disappointed in the\r\nbrilliancy of his parts, and in the readiness of his wit. \"I see little\r\nof parts in him,\" observes Walpole, \"nor attribute much to that cunning\r\nfor which he is so famous; it might catch wild Highlanders.\" Singular,\r\nindeed, must have been the contrast between Lord Lovat and the polished\r\nassembly around him: the Lord High Steward, Hardwicke, comely, and\r\nendowed with a fine voice, but \"curiously searching for occasions to bow\r\nto the Minister, Henry Pelham,\" and asking at all hands what he was to\r\ndo. The rude Highland clansmen, vassals of Lord Lovat's, but witnesses\r\nagainst him; above all, the blot and scourge of the Jacobite cause,\r\nMurray of Broughton, who was the chief witness against the prisoner,\r\nmust have formed an assembly of differing characters not often to be\r\nseen, and never to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe trial lasted five days; it affords, as has been well remarked, a\r\nhistory of the whole of the Rebellion of 1745. Robert Chevis of\r\nMuirtown, a near neighbour of Lovat's, but, as the counsel for the Crown\r\nobserved, a man of very different principles, gave testimony against the\r\nprisoner. At the end of the third day, Lord Lovat, pleading that he had\r\nbeen up at four o'clock in the morning, \"to attend their Lordships,\" and\r\ndeclaring that he would rather \"die on the road than not pay them that\r\nrespect,\" prayed a respite of a day, which was granted. It appeared,\r\nindeed, doubtful in what form death would seize him first, and whether\r\ndisease and age might not cheat the scaffold of its victim.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat spoke long in his defence, but without producing any\r\nrevulsion in his favour. Throughout the whole of the proceedings he\r\nappears not to have dreaded the rigour of the law; when the defence was\r\nclosed, and the Lord High Steward was about to put the question, guilty\r\nor not guilty, to the House, the Lieutenant of the Tower was ordered by\r\nthe Lord Steward to take the prisoner from the bar, but not back to the\r\nTower.\r\n\r\n\"If your Lordships,\" said Lovat, \"would send me to the Highlands, I\r\nwould not go to the Tower any more.\" He was pronounced guilty by the\r\nunanimous votes of one hundred and seventeen Lords present. He was then\r\ninformed of his sentence, and remanded to his prison. On the following\r\nday, March the nineteenth, he was brought up to receive sentence. On\r\nthat occasion, in reply to the question \"why judgment of death should\r\nnot be passed upon him,\" he made a long and, considering his fatigues\r\nand infirmities, an extraordinary speech, giving the Lords \"millions of\r\nthanks for being so good in their patience and attendance,\" and drawing\r\na parallel between the two different men of the name of Murray, who had\r\nfigured in the trial. The one was Murray of Broughton; the other, Murray\r\nafterwards Lord Mansfield. He then went into the history of his life;\r\nor, at least, into such passages of it as were proper for the public\r\near. He was interrupted by the Lord High Steward, whose conduct to the\r\nunhappy State prisoner is said to have been peevish and overbearing.\r\n\r\nJudgment of death was then pronounced upon him, and the barbarous\r\nsentence which had been passed upon the Earl of Wintoun was pronounced;\r\n\"to be hanged by the neck, but not till you are dead,\" &c. The prisoner\r\nthen spoke again; hoping by this reiterated reference to his services,\r\nto obtain a mitigation of the sentence; but he spoke to those who heard,\r\nwithout compassion, the petitions for mercy which fell from an aged,\r\ntottering, and miserable old man. Well has it been said, \"Whatever his\r\ncharacter or his crimes might be, the humanity of the British Government\r\nincurred a deep reproach, from the execution of an old man on the very\r\nverge of the grave.\"[254]\r\n\r\nAt last, the Lord High Steward put the final question; \"Would you offer\r\nanything further?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" was the reply, \"but to thank your Lordships for your\r\ngoodness to me. God bless you all; I bid you an everlasting farewell. We\r\nshall not meet all again in the same place,--I am sure of that.\"\r\n\r\nLord Lovat was reconducted to the Tower--that prison on entering which\r\nhe had boasted, that if he were not old and infirm they would have found\r\nit difficult to have kept him there. The people told him they had kept\r\nthose who were much younger. \"Yes,\" he answered, \"but they had not\r\nbroken so many gaols as I have.\"\r\n\r\nHe now met his approaching fate with a composure that it is difficult\r\nnot to admire, even in Lovat. And yet reflection may perhaps suggest\r\nthat the insensibility to the fear of death--an emotion incident to\r\nconscientious minds--bespeaks, in one whose responsibilities had been so\r\ngrossly abused, an insensibility springing from utter depravity. Let us,\r\nhowever, give to the wretched man every possible allowance. He wrote, in\r\nterms of affection, a letter full of religious sentiments to his son,\r\nafter his own condemnation. When the warrant came down for his\r\nexecution, he exclaimed, \"God's will be done!\" With the courtesy that\r\nhad charmed and had betrayed others all his life, he took the gentleman\r\nwho brought the warrant by the hand, thanked him, drank his health, and\r\nassured him that he would not then change places with any prince in\r\nChristendom. He appears, indeed, to have had no misgivings, or he\r\naffected to have none, as to his eternal prospects. When the Lieutenant\r\nof the fortress in the Tower asked him how he did? \"Do?\" was his reply;\r\n\"why I am about doing very well, for I am going to a place where hardly\r\nany majors, and very few lieutenant-generals go.\"\r\n\r\nSome friends still remained warmly attached to this singular man. Mr.\r\nWilliam Fraser, his cousin, advanced a large sum of money to General\r\nWilliamson, to provide for his wants; and, after acting as his\r\nsolicitor, attended him to the last. But Lord Lovat felt deeply the\r\ncircumstance of his having been convicted by his own servants: \"It is\r\nshocking,\" he observed, \"to human nature. I believe that they will carry\r\nabout with them a sting that will accompany them to their grave; yet I\r\nwish them no evil.\"\r\n\r\nHe prayed daily, and fervently; and expressed unbounded confidence in\r\nthe Divine mercy. \"So, my dear child,\" he thus wrote to his son, \"do not\r\nbe in the least concerned for me; for I bless God I have strong reasons\r\nto hope that when it is God's will to call me out of this world, it will\r\nbe by his mercy, and the suffering of my Saviour, Jesus Christ, to enjoy\r\neverlasting happiness in the other world. I wish this may be yours.\"\r\nAfter he had penned this remarkable letter, he asked a gentleman who was\r\nin his room how he liked the letter? The reply was, \"I like it very\r\nwell; it is a very good letter.\" \"I think,\" answered Lord Lovat, \"it is\r\na Christian letter.\"[255]\r\n\r\nIn this last extremity of his singular fortunes, the wife, whom he had\r\nso cruelly treated, forgetful of every thing but her Christian duty,\r\nwrote to him, and offered to repair immediately to London, and to go to\r\nhim in the Tower, if he desired it. But Lord Lovat returned an answer,\r\nin which, for the first time, he adopted the language of conjugal\r\nkindness to Lady Lovat, and refused the generous proposal, worthy of the\r\ndisinterestedness of woman's nature. He declared that he could not take\r\nadvantage of it, after all that had occurred.[256]\r\n\r\nMeantime, an application was made in favour of Lovat by a Mr. Painter,\r\nof St. John's College, Oxford, in the form of three letters, one of\r\nwhich was addressed to the King, another to Lord Chesterfield, a third\r\nto Henry Pelham. The courage of the intercession can scarcely be\r\nappreciated in the present day; in that melancholy period, the slightest\r\nword uttered in behalf of the Insurgents, brought on the interceder the\r\nimputation of secret Jacobitism, a suspicion which even President Forbes\r\nincurred. The petitions for mercy were worded fearlessly; \"In a word,\"\r\nthus concludes that which was addressed to the King, \"bid Lovat live;\r\npunish the vile traytor with life; but let me die; let me bow down my\r\nhead to the block, and receive without fear the friendly blow, which, I\r\nverily believe, will only separate the soul from its body and miseries\r\ntogether.\"[257] In his letter to Lord Chesterfield the Oxonian repeats\r\nhis offer of undergoing the punishment instead of the decrepid old man:\r\n\"This I will be bold to say,\" he adds: \"I will not disgrace your\r\npatronage by want of intrepidity in the hour of death, and that all the\r\ndevils in Milton, with all the ghastly ghosts of Scotsmen that fell at\r\nCulloden, if they could be conjured there, should never move me to say,\r\ncoming upon the scaffold, 'Sir, this is terrible.'\"[258] To Mr. Pelham\r\nhe declared, that \"the post that he wanted was not of the same nature\r\nwith other Court preferments, for which there is generally a great\r\nnumber of competitors, but may be enjoyed without a rival.\"\r\n\r\nThe observations which Lord Lovat made upon this well-meant but absurd\r\nproposal, show his natural shrewdness, or his disbelief in all that is\r\ngood and generous. \"This,\" he exclaimed, on being told of these\r\nremarkable letters, \"is an extraordinary man indeed. I should like to\r\nknow what countryman he is, and whether the thing is fact. Perhaps it\r\nmay be only some _finesse_ in politics, to cast an odium on some\r\nparticular person. In short, Sir, I'm afraid the poor gentleman is weary\r\nof living in this wicked world; in that case, the obligation is altered,\r\nbecause a part of the benefit is intended for himself.\"\r\n\r\nIn his last days, Lovat avowed himself a Roman Catholic; but his known\r\nduplicity caused even this profession of faith to be distrusted. It is\r\nprobable that like many men who have seen much of the world, and have\r\nmingled with those of different persuasions, Lord Lovat attached but\r\nlittle importance to different modes of faith. He was as unscrupulous in\r\nhis religious professions as in all other respects. Early in his career,\r\nhe thought it expedient to obtain the favour of the Pope's nuncio at\r\nParis by conforming to the Romish faith. He declared to the Duke of\r\nArgyle and to Lord Leven that he could not get the Court of St. Germains\r\nto listen to his projects until he had declared himself a papist. One\r\ncan scarcely term this venal conversion[259] an adoption of the\r\nprinciples of any church. The outward symbols of his pretended\r\npersuasion had, however, become dear to him, from habit: he carried\r\nabout his person a silver crucifix, which he often kissed. \"Observe,\" he\r\nsaid, \"this crucifix! Did you ever see a better? How strongly the\r\npassions are marked, how fine the expression is! We keep pictures of our\r\nbest friends, of our parents, and others, but why should we not keep a\r\npicture of Him who has done more than all the world for us?\" When asked,\r\n\"Of what particular sort of Catholic are you? A Jesuit?\" He answered to\r\nthe nobleman who inquired, (and whose name was not known,) \"No, no, my\r\nLord, I am a Jansenist;\" he then avowed his intimacy with that body of\r\nmen, and assured the nobleman, that in _his_ sense of being a Roman\r\nCatholic, he \"was as far from being one as his Lordship, or as any other\r\nnobleman in the House.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is my faith,\" he observed on another occasion, after affirming\r\nthat he had studied controversy for three years, and then turned Roman\r\nCatholic; \"but I have charity for all mankind, and I believe every\r\nhonest man bids fair for Heaven, let his persuasion be what it may; for\r\nthe mercies of the Almighty are great, and his ways past finding out.\"\r\n\r\nThe allusion to his funeral had something touching, coming from the old\r\nHighland chieftain. Almost the solitary good trait in Lovat's character\r\nwas the fondness for his Highland home--a pride in his clan--a yearning\r\nto the last for the mountains, the straths, the burns, now ravaged by\r\nthe despoiler, and red with the blood of the Frasers. \"Bury me,\" he\r\nsaid, \"in my own tomb in the church of Kirk Hill; in former days, I had\r\nmade a codicil to my will, that all the pipers from John O'Groat's house\r\nto Edinburgh should be invited to play at my funeral: that may not be\r\nnow--but still I am sure there will be some good old Highland women to\r\nsing a coronach at my funeral; and there will be a crying and clapping\r\nof hands--for I am one of the greatest of the Highland chieftains.\" The\r\ncircumstance which gave him the most uneasiness was the bill then\r\ndepending for destroying the ancient privileges and jurisdiction of the\r\nHighland chiefs. \"For my part,\" he exclaimed, when referring to the\r\nmeasure, \"I die a martyr to my country.\"\r\n\r\nHe became much attached to one of his warders, and the usual influence\r\nwhich he seems to have possessed over every being with whom he came into\r\ncollision, attracted the regards of this man to him. \"Go with me to the\r\nscaffold,\" said Lovat--\"and leave me not till you see this head cut off\r\nthe body. Tell my son, the Master of Lovat, with what tenderness I have\r\nparted from you.\" \"Do you think,\" he exclaimed, on the man's expressing\r\nsome sympathy with his approaching fate, \"I am afraid of an axe? 'Tis a\r\ndebt we all owe, and what we must all pay; and do you not think it\r\nbetter to go off so, than to linger with a fever, gout, or consumption?\r\nThough my constitution is so good, I might have lived twenty years\r\nlonger had I not been brought hither.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the week which elapsed between the warrant for his being brought\r\ndown to the Tower, and his death, although, says a gentleman who\r\nattended him to the scaffold, \"he had a great share of memory and\r\nunderstanding, and an awful idea of religion and a future state, I never\r\ncould observe, in his gesture or speech, the least symptom of fear, or\r\nindeed any symptoms of uneasiness.\"[260] \"I die,\" was his own\r\nexpression, \"as a Christian, and a Highland chieftain should do,--that\r\nis, not in my bed.\" Throughout the whole of that solemn interval, the\r\ncertainty of his fate never dulled the remarkable vivacity of his\r\nconversation, nor the gay courtesy of his manners. No man ever died less\r\nconsistently with his life. \"It is impossible,\"--such is the admission\r\nof a writer who detests his crimes,--\"not to admire the fearlessness\r\neven of this monster in his last moments. But, in another view, it is\r\nsomewhat difficult to resist a laugh of scorn at his impudent project of\r\natoning for all the vices of a long and odious career, by going off with\r\na fine sentiment on his lips.\"[261]\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the ninth of April, and the day appointed for his death,\r\nLord Lovat awoke about three in the morning, and then called for a glass\r\nof wine and water, as was his custom. He took the greatest pains that\r\nevery outward arrangement should bear the marks of composure and\r\ndecency,--a care which may certainly incline one to fancy, that the\r\nheroism of his last moments may have had effect, in part, for its aim,\r\nand that, as Talleyrand said of Mirabeau, \"he dramatized his death.\"\r\nBut, it must be remembered, that in those days, it was the custom and\r\nthe aim of the state prisoners to go to the scaffold gallantly; and thus\r\nvirtuous men and true penitents walked to their doom attired with the\r\nprecision of coxcombs. Lord Lovat, who had smoked his pipe merrily\r\nduring his imprisonment with those about him, and had heard the last\r\napprisal of his fate without emotion, was angry, when within a few hours\r\nof death and judgment, that his wig was not so much powdered as usual.\r\n\"If he had had a suit of velvet embroidered, he would wear it,\" he said,\r\n\"on that occasion.\" He then conversed with his barber, whose father was\r\na Muggletonian, about the nature of the soul, adding with a smile, \"I\r\nhope to be in Heaven at one o'clock, or I should not be so merry now.\"\r\nBut, with all this loquacity, and display of what was, perhaps, in part,\r\nthe insensibility of extreme age, the \"behaviour that was said to have\r\nhad neither dignity nor gravity\"[262] in it at the trial, had lost the\r\nbuffoonish character which characterized it in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock, a scaffold which had been erected near the block fell\r\ndown, and several persons were killed, and many injured; but the\r\nproceedings of the day went on. No reprieve, no thoughts of mercy ever\r\ncame to shake the fortitude of the old man. At eleven, the Sheriffs of\r\nLondon sent to demand the prisoner's body: Lord Lovat retired for a few\r\nmoments to pray; then, saying, \"I am ready,\" he left his chamber, and\r\ndescended the stairs, complaining as he went, \"that they were very\r\ntroublesome to him.\"\r\n\r\nHe was carried to the outer gate in the Governor's coach, and then\r\ndelivered to the Sheriffs, and was by them conveyed to a house, lined\r\nwith black, near to the scaffold. He was promised that his head should\r\nnot be exposed on the four corners of the scaffold, that practice, in\r\nsimilar cases, having been abandoned: and that his clothes might be\r\ndelivered with his corpse to his friends, as a compensation for which,\r\nto the executioner, he presented ten guineas contained in a purse of\r\nrich texture. He then thanked the Sheriff, and saluted his friends,\r\nsaying, \"My blood, I hope, will be the last shed upon this occasion.\"\r\n\r\nHe then walked towards the scaffold. It was a memorable and a mournful\r\nsight to behold the aged prisoner ascending those steps, supported by\r\nothers, thus to close a life which must, at any rate, soon have been\r\nextinguished in a natural decay. As he looked round and saw the\r\nmultitudes assembled to witness this disgraceful execution, \"God save\r\nus!\" he exclaimed; \"why should there be such a bustle about taking off\r\nan old grey head, that cannot get up three steps without two men to\r\nsupport it?\" Seeing one of his friends deeply dejected, \"Cheer up,\" he\r\nsaid, clapping him on the shoulder; \"I am not afraid, why should you\r\nbe?\"\r\n\r\nHe then gave the executioner his last gift, begging him not to hack and\r\ncut about his shoulders, under pain of his rising to reproach him. He\r\nfelt the edge of the axe, and said \"he believed it would do;\" then his\r\neyes rested for some moments on the inscription on his coffin. \"Simon\r\nDominus Fraser de Lovat, decollat. April 9, 1747. AEtat 80.\" He repeated\r\nthe line from Horace:--\r\n\r\n    \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.\"\r\n\r\nThen quoted Ovid:--\"Nam genus et proavos, et quae non fecimus ipsi, vix\r\nea nostra voco.\"\r\n\r\nHe took leave of his solicitor, Mr. William Fraser, and presented him\r\nwith his gold cane, as a mark of his confidence and token of\r\nremembrance. Then he embraced another relative, Mr. James Fraser.\r\n\"James,\" said the old chieftain, \"I am going to Heaven, but you must\r\ncontinue to crawl a little longer in this evil world.\" He made no\r\naddress to the assembled crowds, but left a paper, which he delivered to\r\nthe Sheriffs, containing his last protestations. After his sentence,\r\nLovat had accustomed his crippled limbs to kneel, that he might be able\r\nto assume that posture at the block. He now kneeled down, and after a\r\nshort prayer gave the preconcerted signal that he was ready; this was\r\nthe throwing of a handkerchief upon the floor. The executioner severed\r\nhis head from his body at one blow. A piece of scarlet cloth received\r\nhis head, which was placed in the coffin with his body and conveyed to\r\nthe Tower, where it remained until four o'clock. It was then given to an\r\nundertaker.\r\n\r\nIn the paper delivered to the Sheriff there were these words, which\r\nwould have partly been deemed excellent had they proceeded from any\r\nother man:--\"As it may reasonably be expected of me that I should say\r\nsomething of myself in this place, I declare I die a true but unworthy\r\nmember of the Holy, Catholic, Apostolic Church. As to my death, I cannot\r\nlook upon it but as glorious. I sincerely pardon all my enemies,\r\npersecutors, and slanderers, from the highest to the lowest, whom God\r\nforgive as I heartily do. I die in perfect charity with all mankind. I\r\nsincerely repent of all my sins, and firmly hope to obtain pardon and\r\nforgiveness for them through the merits and passion of my blessed Lord\r\nand Redeemer, Jesus Christ, into whose hands I recommend my soul. Amen.\r\n\r\n                                                             LOVAT.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the Tower, April 9, 1747.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe public might well contrast the relentless hand of justice, in this\r\ninstance, with the mercy of Queen Anne. She, like her brother the\r\nChevalier, averse from shedding blood, had spared the life of an old\r\nman, who had been condemned in her reign for treason. Many other\r\nprecedents of a similar kind have been adduced.[263] But this act of\r\ninhumanity was only part of a system of what was called justice; but\r\nwhich was the justice of the heathen, and not of the Christian.\r\n\r\nIf the character of Lord Lovat cannot be deduced from his actions, it\r\nmust be impossible to understand the motives of man from any course of\r\nlife; for never was a career more strongly marked by the manifestation\r\nof the passions, than that of this unworthy descendant of a great line.\r\nHis selfishness was unbounded, his rapacity insatiable; his brutality\r\nseems incredible. In the foregoing narrative, the mildest view has been\r\nadopted of his remorseless cruelty: of his gross and revolting\r\nindulgences, of his daily demeanour, which is said to have outraged\r\neverything that is seemly, everything that is holy, in private life,\r\nlittle has been written. Much that was alleged to Lovat, in this\r\nparticular, has been contradicted: much may be ascribed to the universal\r\nhatred of his name, which tinted, perhaps too highly, his vices, in his\r\nown day. Something may be ascribed to party prejudice, which gladly\r\nseized upon every occasion of reproach to an adversary. Yet still, there\r\nis too much that is probable, too much that is too true, to permit a\r\nhope that the private and moral character of Lord Lovat can be\r\nvindicated from the deepest stains.\r\n\r\nBy his public life, he has left an indelible stain upon the honour of\r\nthe Highland character, upon his party, upon his country. Of principle\r\nhe had none:--for prudence, he substituted a low description of\r\ntime-serving: he never would have promoted the interests of the\r\nHanoverians in the reign of George the First, if the Court of St.\r\nGermains had tolerated his alliance: he never would have sided with\r\nCharles Edward, if the Court of St. James's had not withdrawn its\r\nconfidence. His pride and his revengeful spirit went hand in hand\r\ntogether. The former quality had nothing in it of that lofty character\r\nwhich raises it almost to a virtue, in the stern Scottish character: it\r\nwas the narrow-minded love of power which is generated in a narrow\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nIn the different relations of his guilty life, only one redeeming\r\nfeature is apparent,--the reverence which Lord Lovat bore to his\r\nfather. With that parent, seems to have been buried every gentle\r\naffection: he regarded his wives as slaves; he looked upon his sons with\r\nno other regard and solicitude, than as being heirs of his estates. As a\r\nchief and a master, his conduct has been variously represented; the\r\nprevailing belief is, that it was marked by oppression, violence, and\r\ntreachery: yet, as no man in existence ever was so abandoned as not to\r\nhave his advocates, even the truth of this popular belief has been\r\nquestioned, on the ground that the influence which he exercised over\r\nthem, in being able to urge them to engage in whatsoever side he\r\npleased, argues some qualities which must have engaged their\r\naffections.[264]\r\n\r\nHe who pleads thus, must, however, have forgotten the hereditary sway of\r\na Highland chieftain, existing in unbroken force in those days: he must\r\nhave forgotten the sentiment which was inculcated from the cradle, the\r\nloyalty of clanship,--a sentiment which led on the brave hearts in which\r\nit was cherished to far more remarkable exertions and proofs of fidelity\r\nthan even the history of the Frasers can supply.\r\n\r\nBut the deepest dye of guilt appears in Lord Lovat's conduct as a\r\nfather. It was not only that he was, in the infancy and boyhood of his\r\neldest born, harsh and imperious: such was the custom of the period. It\r\nwas not only that he impelled the young man into a course which his own\r\nreason disapproved, and which he undertook with reluctance and disgust\r\nthrowing, on one occasion, his white cockade into the fire, and only\r\ncomplying with his father's orders upon force. This was unjustifiable\r\ncompulsion in any father, but it might be excused on the plea of zeal\r\nfor the cause. But it appeared on the trial that the putting forward the\r\nMaster of Lovat was a mere feint to save himself at the expense of his\r\nson, if affairs went wrong. In Lord Lovat's letters to President Forbes\r\nthe poor young man was made to bear the brunt of the whole blame;\r\nalthough Lord Lovat had frequently complained of his son's backwardness\r\nto certain members of his clan. On the trial it appeared that the whole\r\naim of Lord Lovat was, as Sir John Strange expressed it, \"an endeavour\r\nto avoid being fixed himself and to throw it all upon his son,--that son\r\nwhom he had, in a manner, forced into the Rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nRare, indeed, is such a case;--with that, let these few remarks on the\r\ncharacter of Lord Lovat, conclude. Human nature can sink to no lower\r\ndepth of degradation.\r\n\r\nLord Lovat left, by his first wife, three children:--Simon, Master of\r\nLovat; Janet, who was married to Ewan Macpherson of Cluny,--a match\r\nwhich Lord Lovat projected in order to increase his influence, and to\r\nstrengthen his Highland connections. This daughter was grandmother to\r\nthe present chief, and died in 1765. He had also another daughter,\r\nSybilla.\r\n\r\nThis daughter was one of those rare beings whose elevated minds seem to\r\nexpand in despite of every evil influence around them. Her mother died\r\nin giving her birth; and Lord Lovat, perhaps from remorse for the\r\nuncomplaining and ill-used wife, evinced much concern at the death of\r\nhis first lady, and showed a degree of consideration for his daughters\r\nwhich could hardly have been expected from one so steeped in vice.\r\nAlthough his private life at Castle Downie, after the death of their\r\nmother was disgusting in detail, and therefore, better consigned to\r\noblivion, the gentle presence of his two daughters restrained the coarse\r\nwitticisms of their father, and he seemed to regard them both with\r\naffection and respect, and to be proud of the decorum of their conduct\r\nand manners. Disgusted with the profligacy which, as they grew up, they\r\ncould not but observe at Castle Downie, the young ladies generally chose\r\nto reside at Leatwell, with Lady Mackenzie, their only aunt; and Lord\r\nLovat did not resent their leaving him, but rather applauded a delicacy\r\nof feeling which cast so deep a reproach upon him. He was to them a kind\r\nindulgent father. When Janet, Lady Clunie, was confined of her first\r\nchild, he brought her to Castle Downie that she might have the\r\nattendance of physicians more easily than in the remote country where\r\nthe Macphersons lived. He always expressed regret that her mother had\r\nnot been sufficiently attended to when her last child was born.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Sybilla Fraser presents her as another victim to the\r\nhardness and impiety of Lovat. \"She possessed,\" says Mrs. Grant, \"a high\r\ndegree of sensibility, which when strongly excited by the misfortunes of\r\nher family, exalted her habitual piety into all the fervour of\r\nenthusiasm.\" When Lovat passed through Badenoch, after his\r\napprehension, Sybilla, who was there with Lady Clunie, followed him to\r\nDalwhinney, and there, in an agony of mind which may be readily\r\nconceived, entreated her aged father to reconcile himself to his Maker,\r\nand to withdraw his thoughts from the world. She was answered by taunts\r\nat her \"womanish weakness,\" as Lovat called it, and by coarse ridicule\r\nof his enemies, with a levity of mind shocking under such circumstances.\r\nThe sequel cannot be better told than in these few simple words:\r\n\"Sybilla departed almost in despair; prayed night and day, not for his\r\nlife, but for his soul; and when she heard soon after, that 'he had died\r\nand made no sign,' grief in a short time put an end to her life.\"[265]\r\n\r\nThe Master of Lovat was implicated, as we have shown, in the troubles of\r\n1745. Early in that year, he had the misery of discovering the treachery\r\nof his father, by accidentally finding the rough draught of a letter\r\nwhich Lord Lovat had written to the President, in order to excuse\r\nhimself at the expense of his son. \"Good God!\" exclaimed the young man,\r\n\"how can he use me so? I will go at once to the President, and put the\r\nsaddle on the right horse.\" In spite of this provocation, he did not,\r\nhowever, reveal his father's treachery; whilst Lord Lovat was balancing\r\nbetween hopes and fears, and irresolute which side to choose, the Master\r\nat last entreated, with tears in his eyes, that \"he might no longer be\r\nmade a tool of--but might have such orders as his father might stand\r\nby.\"\r\n\r\nHaving received these orders, and engaged in the insurrection, the\r\nMaster of Lovat was zealous in discharging the duties in which he had\r\nthus unwillingly engaged. His clan were among the few who came up at\r\nCulloden in time to effect a junction with Prince Charles. In 1746 an\r\nAct of Attainder was passed against him; he surrendered himself to\r\nGovernment, and was confined nine months in Edinburgh Castle. In 1750 a\r\nfull and free pardon passed the seals for him. He afterwards became an\r\nadvocate, but eventually returned to a military life, and was permitted\r\nto enter the English army. In 1757 he raised a regiment of one thousand\r\neight hundred men, of which he was constituted colonel, at the head of\r\nwhich he distinguished himself at Louisbourg and Quebec. He was\r\nafterwards appointed colonel of the 71st foot, and performed eminent\r\nservices in the American war.\r\n\r\nThe title of his father had been forfeited, and his lands attainted. But\r\nin 1774 the lands and estates were restored upon certain conditions, in\r\nconsideration of Colonel Fraser's eminent services, and in consideration\r\nof his having been involved in \"the late unnatural Rebellion\" at a\r\ntender age. Colonel Fraser rose to the rank of lieutenant-general, and\r\ndied in 1782 without issue; he was generally respected and\r\ncompassionated. He was succeeded in the estates by his half-brother,\r\nArchibald Campbell Fraser, the only child whom Lord Lovat had by his\r\nsecond wife. This young man had mingled, when a boy, from childish\r\ncuriosity among the Jacobite troops at the battle of Culloden, and had\r\nnarrowly escaped from the dragoons.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards entered into the Portuguese service, where he remained\r\nsome years; but, being greatly attached to his own country, he returned.\r\nHe could not, however, conscientiously take the oaths to Government, and\r\ntherefore never had any other military employment. \"With much truth,\r\nhonour, and humanity,\" relates Mrs. Grant, \"he inherited his father's\r\nwit and self-possession, with a vein of keen satire which he indulged in\r\nbitter expressions against the enemies of his family. Some of these I\r\nhave seen, and heard many songs of his composing, which showed no\r\ncontemptible power of poetic genius, although rude and careless of\r\npolish.\" He sank into habits of dissipation and over-conviviality, which\r\nimpaired a reputation otherwise high in his neighbourhood, and became\r\ncareless and hopeless of himself. What little he had to bequeath was\r\nleft to a lady of his own name to whom he was attached, and who remained\r\nunmarried long after his death.\r\n\r\nIt is rather remarkable that Archibald Campbell Fraser, generally, from\r\nhis command of the Invernessshire militia, called Colonel Fraser, should\r\nsurvive his five sons, and that the estates which Lord Lovat had\r\nsacrificed so much to secure to his own line should revert to another\r\nfamily of the clan Fraser,--the Frasers of Stricken, the present\r\nproprietors of Lovat and Stricken, being in Aberdeenshire the\r\ntwenty-second in succession from Simon Fraser of Invernessshire.[266]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[118] Anderson's Historical Account of the Family of Frisel or Fraser,\r\np. 5.\r\n\r\n[119] One of Lord Lovat's family--it is not easy to ascertain\r\nwhich--emigrated after the Rebellion of 1745 into Ireland, and settled\r\nin that country, where he possessed considerable landed property, which\r\nis still enjoyed by one of his descendants. There is an epitaph on the\r\nfamily vault of this branch of the Frizells or Frazers, in the\r\nchurchyard of Old Ross, in the County of Wexford, bearing this\r\ninscription:--\"The burial place of Charles Frizell, son of Charles\r\nFraser Frizell of Ross, and formerly of Beaufort, North Britain.\" For\r\nthis information I am indebted to the Rev. John Frizell, of Great\r\nNormanton, Derbyshire, and one of this Irish branch of the family, of\r\nwhich his brother is the lineal representative.\r\n\r\n[120] Anderson's Historical Account of the Family of Fraser.\r\n\r\n[121] Memoirs of the Life of Lord Lovat, written by himself in the\r\nFrench Language, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[122] Memoirs of the Life of Lord Lovat, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[123] In speaking of the other members of the family, Mr. Anderson\r\nremarks:--\"The parish registers of Kiltarlity, Kirkill, and Kilmorack,\r\nwere at the same time examined with the view of tracing the other\r\nchildren of Thomas of Beaufort, but the communications of the various\r\nclergymen led to the knowledge that no memorials of them exist. The\r\nremote branches called to the succession in General Fraser's entail\r\nproves, to a certainty, that these children died unmarried.\"--_Anderson's\r\nHistorical Account of the Family of Fraser._ It appears, however, from a\r\nprevious note, that a branch of the family still exists in Ireland.\r\n\r\n[124] See State Trials.
