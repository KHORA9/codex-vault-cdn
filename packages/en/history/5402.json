OF CAMBRIDGE; AND WILLIAM SOAMES, ESQ. OF\r\nTHE HON. SOCIETY OF NEWMAN'S HOTEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe merit of Captain Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue has\r\nbeen long and universally acknowledged. But its circulation was\r\nconfined almost exclusively to the lower orders of society: he\r\nwas not aware, at the time of its compilation, that our young men\r\nof fashion would at no very distant period be as distinguished\r\nfor the vulgarity of their jargon as the inhabitants of Newgate;\r\nand he therefore conceived it superfluous to incorporate with his\r\nwork the few examples of fashionable slang that might occur to\r\nhis observation.\r\n\r\nBut our Jehus of rank have a phraseology not less peculiar to\r\nthemselves, than the disciples of Barrington: for the uninitiated\r\nto understand their modes of expression, is as impossible as for\r\na Buxton to construe the Greek Testament. To sport an Upper\r\nBenjamin, and to swear with a good grace, are qualifications\r\neasily attainable by their cockney imitators; but without the aid\r\nof our additional definitions, neither the cits of Fish-street,\r\nnor the boors of Brentford would be able to attain the language\r\nof whippism. We trust, therefore, that the whole tribe of\r\nsecond-rate Bang Ups, will feel grateful for our endeavour to render\r\nthis part of the work as complete as possible. By an occasional\r\nreference to our pages, they may be initiated into all the\r\npeculiarities of language by which the man of spirit is\r\ndistinguished from the man of worth. They may now talk bawdy\r\nbefore their papas, without the fear of detection, and abuse\r\ntheir less spirited companions, who prefer a good dinner at home\r\nto a glorious UP-SHOT in the highway, without the hazard of a\r\ncudgelling.\r\n\r\nBut we claim not merely the praise of gratifying curiosity, or\r\naffording assistance to the ambitious; we are very sure that the\r\nmoral influence of the Lexicon Balatronicum will be more certain\r\nand extensive than that of any methodist sermon that has ever\r\nbeen delivered within the bills of mortality. We need not descant\r\non the dangerous impressions that are made on the female mind, by\r\nthe remarks that fall incidentally from the lips of the brothers\r\nor servants of a family; and we have before observed, that\r\nimproper topics can with our assistance be discussed, even before\r\nthe ladies, without raising a blush on the cheek of modesty. It\r\nis impossible that a female should understand the meaning of\r\nTWIDDLE DIDDLES, or rise from table at the mention of BUCKINGER'S\r\nBOOT. Besides, Pope assures us, that \"VICE TO BE HATED NEEDS BUT\r\nTO BE SEEN;\" in this volume it cannot be denied, that she is seen\r\nvery plainly; and a love of virtue is, therefore, the necessary\r\nresult of perusing it.\r\n\r\nThe propriety of introducing the UNIVERSITY SLANG will be readily\r\nadmitted; it is not less curious than that of the College in the\r\nOld\r\nBailey, and is less generally understood. When the number and\r\naccuracy of our additions are compared with the price of the\r\nvolume, we have no doubt that its editors will meet with the\r\nencouragement that is due to learning, modesty, and virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDICTIONARY OF THE VULGAR TONGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABBESS, or LADY ABBESS, A bawd, the mistress of a\r\n  brothel.\r\n\r\nABEL-WACKETS.

It is thus managed: A large tub is filled with\r\n  water, and two stools placed on each side of it. Over\r\n  the whole is thrown a tarpaulin, or old sail: this is\r\n  kept tight by two persons, who are to represent the king\r\n  and queen of a foreign country, and are seated on the\r\n  stools. The person intended to be ducked plays the Ambassador,\r\n  and after repeating a ridiculous speech dictated\r\n  to him, is led in great form up to the throne, and seated\r\n  between the king and queen, who rising suddenly as soon\r\n  as he is seated, he falls backwards into the tub of water.\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR OF MOROCCO.

Some derive this saying\r\n  from a privilege enjoyed by the friars of certain convents\r\n  in England and France (sons of St. Anthony), whose swine\r\n  were permitted to feed in the streets. These swine would\r\n  follow any one having greens or other provisions, till they\r\n  obtained some of them; and it was in those days considered\r\n  an act of charity and religion to feed them.\r\n\r\nTO KNOCK ANTHONY.

A set of vagrants, who, to the great disgrace of\r\n  our police, are suffered to wander about the country.\r\n  They pretend that they derive their origin from the\r\n  ancient Egyptians, who were famous for their knowledge\r\n  in astronomy and other sciences; and, under the pretence\r\n  of fortune-telling, find means to rob or defraud the ignorant\r\n  and superstitious. To colour their impostures, they\r\n  artificially discolour their faces, and speak a kind of\r\n  gibberish peculiar to themselves. They rove up and down the\r\n  country in large companies, to the great terror of the\r\n  farmers, from whose geese, turkeys, and fowls, they take very\r\n  considerable contributions.\r\n\r\n  When a fresh recruit is admitted into the fraternity, he is to\r\n   take the following oath, administered by the principal\r\n   maunder, after going through the annexed forms:\r\n\r\n  First, a new name is given him by which he is ever after to\r\n   be called; then standing up in the middle of the assembly,\r\n   and directing his face to the dimber damber, or principal\r\n   man of the gang, he repeats the following oath, which is\r\n   dictated to him by some experienced member of the fraternity:\r\n\r\n  I, Crank Cuffin, do swear to be a true brother, and that I will\r\n   in all things obey the commands of the great tawney\r\n   prince, and keep his counsel and not divulge the secrets of\r\n   my brethren.\r\n\r\n  I will never leave nor forsake the company, but observe and\r\n   keep all the times of appointment, either by day or by\r\n   night, in every place whatever.\r\n\r\n  I will not teach any one to cant, nor will I disclose any of\r\n   our mysteries to them.\r\n\r\n  I will take my prince's part against all that shall oppose him,\r\n   or any of us, according to the utmost of my ability; nor\r\n   will I suffer him, or any one belongiug to us, to be abused\r\n   by any strange abrams, rufflers, hookers, pailliards,\r\n   swaddlers, Irish toyles, swigmen, whip jacks, jarkmen,\r\n   bawdy baskets, dommerars, clapper dogeons, patricoes,\r\n   or curtals; but will defend him, or them, as much as I\r\n   can, against all other outliers whatever. I will not conceal\r\n   aught I win out of libkins or from the ruffmans, but\r\n   will preserve it for the use of the company. Lastly, I\r\n   will cleave to my doxy wap stiffly, and will bring her\r\n   duds, marjery praters, goblers, grunting cheats, or tibs\r\n   of the buttery, or any thing else I can come at, as\r\n   winnings for her weppings.\r\n\r\n  The canters have, it seems, a tradition, that from the three\r\n   first articles of this oath, the first founders of a certain\r\n   boastful, worshipful fraternity (who pretend to derive their\r\n   origin from the earliest times) borrowed both the hint and\r\n   form of their establishment; and that their pretended\r\n   derivation from the first Adam is a forgery, it being only\r\n   from the first Adam Tiler: see ADAM TILER. At the\r\n   admission of a new brother, a general stock is raised for\r\n   booze, or drink, to make themselves merry on the occasion.\r\n   As for peckage or eatables, they can procure without\r\n   money; for while some are sent to break the ruffmans,\r\n   or woods and bushes, for firing, others are detached to\r\n   filch geese, chickens, hens, ducks (or mallards), and pigs.\r\n   Their morts are their butchers, who presently make\r\n   bloody work with what living things are brought them; and\r\n   having made holes in the ground under some remote hedge\r\n   in an obscure place, they make a fire and boil or broil their\r\n   food; and when it is enough, fall to work tooth and nail:\r\n   and having eaten more like beasts than men, they drink\r\n   more like swine than human creatures, entertaining one\r\n   another all the time with songs in the canting dialect.\r\n\r\n  As they live, so they lie, together promiscuously, and know\r\n   not how to claim a property either in their goods or children:\r\n   and this general interest ties them more firmly together\r\n   than if all their rags were twisted into ropes, to bind\r\n   them indissolubly from a separation; which detestable\r\n   union is farther consolidated by the above oath.\r\n\r\n  They stroll up and down all summer-time in droves, and\r\n   Dexterously pick pockets, while they are telling of fortunes;\r\n   and the money, rings, silver thirribles, &c. which they\r\n   get, are instantly conveyed from one hand to another,\r\n   till the remotest person of the gang (who is not suspected\r\n   because they come not near the person robbed) gets possession\r\n   of it; so that, in the strictest search, it is impossible to\r\n   recover it; while the wretches with imprecations,\r\n   oaths, and protestations, disclaim the thievery.\r\n\r\n  That by which they are said to get the most money, is,\r\n   when young gentlewomen of good families and reputation\r\n   have happened to be with child before marriage, a round\r\n   sum is often bestowed among the gypsies, for some one\r\n   mort to take the child; and as that is never heard of\r\n   more by the true mother and family, so the disgrace is\r\n   kept concealed from the world; and, if the child lives, it\r\n   never knows its parents.\r\n\r\nHABERDASHER OF PRONOUNS.

This refers to former times; the hangmen of the\r\n  present day having, like other artificers, raised their prices.\r\n  The true state of this matter is, that a Scottish mark was\r\n  the fee allowed for an execution, and the value of that\r\n  piece was settled by a proclamation of James I. at thirteen\r\n  pence halfpenny.\r\n\r\nHANK.
